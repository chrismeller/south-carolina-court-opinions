Murphy and Ashley Berry Stratton, both of Murphy\r\n            & Grantland, P.A., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This appeal follows a bench trial in a declaratory judgment\r\naction involving automobile insurance coverage. On appeal, Douglas Stiltner and\r\n\nChristine Rene Stiltner argue the circuit court erred by finding Mr. Stiltner (1)\r\nauthorized Mrs. Stiltner to reject USAA's meaningful offer of Underinsured\r\nMotorist Coverage (UIM)1 and (2) ratified Mrs. Stiltner's rejection of USAA's\r\nmeaningful offer of UIM. Evidence in the record supports the circuit court's\r\nfinding that Mrs. Stiltner acted within the scope of authority given to her by Mr.\r\nStiltner when she signed the UIM rejection forms. Therefore, we affirm pursuant\r\nto Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities: Frazier v. Smallseed, 384\r\nS.C. 56, 61, 682 S.E.2d 8, 11 (Ct. App. 2009) (\"In an action at law tried by a judge\r\nwithout a jury, the appellate court will correct any error of law, but it must affirm\r\nthe trial court's factual findings unless no evidence reasonably supports those\r\nfindings.\"); Bankers Trust of S.C. v. Bruce, 283 S.C. 408, 423, 323 S.E.2d 523, 532\r\n(Ct. App. 1984) (\"The relationship of agency between a husband and wife is\r\ngoverned by the same rules which apply to other agencies.\"); Allstate Ins. Co. v.\r\nEstate of Hancock, 345 S.C. 81, 87 n.4, 545 S.E.2d 845, 848 n.4 (Ct. App. 2001)\r\n(noting \"that it may be possible for a spouse to reject UIM coverage if he or she\r\ndoes so as an agent authorized to act on the applicant's behalf\"); id. (\"In such a\r\ncase, the existence and scope of an agency relationship are questions of fact.\");\r\nML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte & Touche, 327 S.C. 238, 242, 489\r\nS.E.2d 470, 472 (1997) (\"[T]he authorized acts of an agent are the acts of the\r\nprincipal.\").2\r\n\r\n\r\n1 In support of their first issue on appeal, the Stiltners assert that the circuit court\r\nerred by characterizing Mrs. Stiltner's authority as implied authority. The Stiltners\r\ncontend any authority Mrs. Stiltner had was express. The issue before the circuit\r\ncourt was whether Mrs. Stiltner acted within the scope of her authority.\r\nAccordingly, any error on the label of the authority or agency did not affect the\r\nfinding that Mrs. Stiltner was acting within the scope of authority given to her by\r\nMr. Stiltner when she signed the UIM rejection forms. See Judy v. Judy, 384 S.C.\r\n634, 646, 682 S.E.2d 836, 842 (Ct. App. 2009) (noting this court \"will not set aside\r\njudgments due to insubstantial errors not affecting the result\").\r\n2  Because we affirm the circuit court's finding that Mr. Stiltner authorized Mrs.\r\nStiltner to sign the UIM rejection forms, we need not address whether the circuit\r\ncourt erred by finding Mr. Stiltner ratified Mrs. Stiltner's rejection of UIM\r\ncoverage.

McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613,\r\n518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not address remaining\r\nissues on appeal when the disposition of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nPIEPER, KONDUROS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-085","title":"State v.

Vedad contends that the ALC erred in finding that the\r\nprocedures employed in his termination provided adequate due process. We affirm\r\npursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities:\r\n\r\n1.\t   As to whether the ALC erred in concluding the South Carolina State\r\n      Employee Grievance Procedure Act does not create a property interest in\r\n      continued state employment: S.C. Code Ann. §§ 8-17-320 to -340 (Supp.\r\n      2013) (providing a \"covered [state] employee\" with grievance rights and a\r\n      procedure to appeal to the State Employee Grievance Committee for review\r\n      of an agency's final decision regarding an adverse action against the\r\n      employee; but not indicating a state employee has a \"property interest\" in\r\n      continued employment); Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v.

Roth,\r\n      408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972)).\r\n\r\n2.\t   As to whether the ALC erred in finding Vedad's post-termination hearing\r\n      before the State Employee Grievance Committee afforded Vedad adequate\r\n      due process in his termination proceedings: Kurschner v.

Blitch, Jr., both of\r\n             Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Eric Wright was convicted of assault and battery with intent to\r\nkill (ABWIK) and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent\r\ncrime. He appeals, arguing the trial court erred in (1) failing to grant his motion\r\nfor mistrial based on the admission of hearsay testimony, (2) failing to grant his\r\n\nBatson1 motion, and (3) removing the foreperson from the jury without good cause.\r\nWe affirm.\r\n\r\n1.      We find no error in the trial court's denial of Wright's motion for mistrial\r\nbased upon the admission of alleged hearsay testimony. Wright complains about\r\ntestimony from Alexus, an eyewitness to the incident, after the trial court made an\r\nin limine ruling excluding any hearsay testimony from a witness that \"they call [the\r\nshooter] Bo,\" if the witness did not know the shooter. In response to the solicitor's\r\nquestion whether Alexus knew the name of the shooter, she stated, \"I don't know\r\nhis real name, but I know they call him Bo.\" Even if we were to assume this\r\ntestimony constituted hearsay,2 we find no reversible error. Prior to her testimony\r\nthat she did not know the shooter's real name but she knew \"they call him Bo,\"\r\nAlexus had already testified, without objection, that \"Bo got out of the car, and\r\npointed a gun . . . . He pointed the gun at [Victim] and shot twice.\" Wright argues\r\nAlexus' testimony \"they call him Bo\" was improper because it was hearsay\r\ntestimony that identified him, Bo, as the shooter. Because Alexus had already\r\nidentified the shooter as \"Bo,\" her later testimony \"they call him Bo\" could not\r\nhave prejudiced Wright. See State v. Price, 368 S.C. 494, 499, 629 S.E.2d 363,\r\n366 (2006) (noting improper admission of hearsay evidence is reversible error only\r\nwhen the admission causes prejudice; the admission of improper hearsay evidence\r\nis harmless where the evidence is merely cumulative to other evidence). At any\r\nrate, the trial court's explicit instruction to the jury to strike the question and strike\r\nAlexus' answer cured any possible error, and the prejudicial effect would have\r\nbeen minimal such that a mistrial would not have been warranted. See State v.\r\nHerring, 387 S.C. 201, 216, 692 S.E.2d 490, 498 (2009) (noting a curative\r\ninstruction to disregard the testimony is usually deemed to cure any alleged error);\r\nState v. Dempsey, 340 S.C. 565, 570, 532 S.E.2d 306, 309 (Ct. App. 2000)\r\n(holding \"a mistrial should not be ordered in every case where incompetent\r\nevidence is received and later stricken from the record,\" and noting an instruction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).\r\n2 We are not convinced this testimony was inadmissible hearsay. The context in\r\nwhich Alexus testified, \"I don't know his real name, but I know they call him Bo\"\r\nis unclear. Although the trial court initially agreed with defense counsel's\r\ncharacterization of such testimony as hearsay, it underpinned that ruling based on a\r\nfoundation issue, i.e., whether the witness had an independent knowledge that the\r\nperson was known as \"Bo.\" Here, how Alexus came to understand the shooter's\r\nname was \"Bo\" was never explored at trial.\r\n\nto disregard incompetent evidence will usually be deemed to cure any error in its\r\nadmission unless under the facts of the particular case \"it is probable that,\r\nnotwithstanding such instruction, the accused was prejudiced.\").\r\n\r\n2.     We find no merit to Wright's assertion that the trial court erred in denying\r\nhis Batson motion. Wright contends, though the State provided a gender-neutral\r\nreason on its face, the defense proved the reason was actually pretext.3 Here, the\r\nrecord supports the trial court's denial of Wright's Batson motion. The State\r\nprovided a gender-neutral explanation for using peremptory challenges on Jurors\r\n173 and 46, elucidating that the two male jurors had charges, or \"items,\" on their\r\nrap sheets, and this explanation was not fundamentally implausible. While the\r\nsolicitor agreed that a conviction was not necessary to trigger strikes, she specified\r\nher decision was based upon whether the potential juror \"hit the radar for a\r\ncriminal record.\" Though Wright challenged the explanation as pretext based upon\r\nthe State's acceptance of female Juror 119, the solicitor made clear that the absence\r\nof charges on a rap sheet would not trigger the criminal record she looked for in\r\nmaking her decision to strike a potential juror. Because the rap sheet on Juror 119\r\nincluded no charges or disposition of charges, the solicitor interpreted it as\r\nincluding nothing to show an arrest, and the juror therefore having no record.\r\nThus, the State provided a meaningful distinction between female Juror 119 and\r\nmale Jurors 173 and 46. Giving the trial court's finding due deference and\r\nreviewing the trial court's ruling under a clearly erroneous standard, we find the\r\nrecord supports the trial court's finding of a gender-neutral explanation for the\r\nstrikes and its denial of Wright's Batson motion. See State v. Edwards, 384 S.C.\r\n504, 509, 682 S.E.2d 820, 822-23 (2009) (noting, in determining whether a Batson\r\nviolation has occurred, appellate courts give the trial court's findings great\r\ndeference on appeal; the trial court's determination concerning whether purposeful\r\ndiscrimination has occurred rests largely on the court's evaluation of demeanor and\r\ncredibility; the demeanor of the challenged attorney will often be the best and only\r\nevidence of discrimination, and an evaluation of the attorney's mind lies peculiarly\r\nwithin a trial court's province).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 While Wright's stated issue on appeal asserts error, in part, on the trial court's\r\nfailure to grant his Batson motion after removal of the foreperson, Wright did not\r\nask to renew his Batson motion following removal of the foreperson. Accordingly,\r\nthis argument is not preserved for our review. See State v. Freiburger, 366 S.C.\r\n125, 134, 620 S.E.2d 737, 741 (2005) (finding an argument advanced on appeal\r\nwas not raised and ruled on below and therefore was not preserved for review).\r\n\nFurther, even if we were to accept Wright's argument, that the fact that Juror 119\r\nhad a rap sheet indicated she had a criminal record, the uneven application of a\r\ngender-neutral reason does not automatically result in a finding of invidious\r\ndiscrimination if the strike's proponent provides a gender-neutral explanation for\r\nthe inconsistency. State v. Cochran, 369 S.C. 308, 334, 631 S.E.2d 294, 308 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2006). See also State v. Casey, 325 S.C. 447, 454, 481 S.E.2d 169, 173 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1997) (holding, although the State applied its facially valid reason\r\ninconsistently in permitting a like-situated female juror to be seated, the State's\r\nexplanation of mistake for the omission was gender-neutral). The solicitor\r\nindicated she did not use a strike on Juror 119 because she did not believe her to\r\nhave an arrest record. The solicitor's explanation was based upon her interpretation\r\nof Juror 119's purported rap sheet, i.e, that it showed no charges against the juror.\r\nMindful that a determination as to whether a Batson violation has occurred must be\r\nbased upon the totality of facts and circumstances in the record, as well that great\r\ndeference is to be afforded the trial court's findings and that the appellate court's\r\nreview of the trial court's ruling is under a clearly erroneous standard, we find the\r\nState provided a gender-neutral explanation for any inconsistency.\r\n\r\n3.     Wright contends the trial court abused its discretion by removal and\r\nreplacement of the foreperson without good cause, and over both his and the\r\nforeperson's objection. We disagree. \"[A] criminal defendant has no right to a trial\r\nby any particular jury, but only a right to a trial by a competent and impartial jury.\"\r\nSmith v. State, 375 S.C. 507, 518, 654 S.E.2d 523, 529 (2007) (quoting Palacio v.\r\nState, 333 S.C. 506, 517, 511 S.E.2d 62, 68 (1999)). The trial court has a \"duty to\r\nassure [itself] that every juror is unbiased, fair and impartial.\" State v. Gulledge,\r\n277 S.C. 368, 370, 287 S.E.2d 488, 489 (1982). See also State v. Powers, 331 S.C.\r\n37, 43, 501 S.E.2d 116, 118 (1998) (\"It is the duty of the trial [court] to see that a\r\njury of unbiased, fair and impartial persons is impaneled.\"). Further, \"a trial\r\n[court] has the inherent power to maintain order and decorum in [its] courtroom.\"\r\nState v. Beckham, 334 S.C. 302, 314, 513 S.E.2d 606, 612 (1999). See also State v.\r\nShelton, 270 S.C. 577, 580, 243 S.E.2d 455, 457 (1978) (\"A trial judge has the\r\ninherent power to preserve order in his court and to see that justice is not\r\nobstructed by any person or persons. He has the authority to take such measures as\r\nappear reasonably necessary to secure orderly proceedings and to preserve the\r\nsecurity of those participating in the trial or lawfully attending the proceedings.\").\r\nAdditionally, \"[i]n a criminal prosecution, the conduct of the jurors should be free\r\nfrom all extraneous or improper influences.\" State v. Kelly, 331 S.C. 132, 141, 502\r\nS.E.2d 99, 104 (1998); State v. Hill, 394 S.C. 312, 320, 714 S.E.2d 879, 883 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2011). The determination of whether to dismiss a juror and replace him with\r\n\nan alternate is within the sound discretion of the trial court, and such will not be\r\ndisturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. State v. Carmack, 388 S.C. 190,\r\n198, 694 S.E.2d 224, 228 (Ct. App. 2010). See also State v. Lindsey, 372 S.C. 185,\r\n194, 642 S.E.2d 557, 562 (2007) (finding no abuse of discretion in the denial of the\r\nappellant's motion to remove a juror and replace the juror with an alternate, noting\r\nit is within the trial court's discretion whether to dismiss a juror and substitute with\r\nan alternate juror); State v. Simmons, 360 S.C. 33, 43, 599 S.E.2d 448, 452 (2004)\r\n(holding the trial court acted within its discretion in excusing a juror for the juror's\r\nunauthorized communication with his wife).\r\n\r\nWe hold the trial court acted within its discretion in removing the foreperson from\r\nthe jury. The trial court placed on the record valid reasons for its concern with the\r\nforeperson continuing to serve. The court noted it had been informed the\r\nforeperson was \"cursing in the middle of the hallway\" and \"acting so badly\" the\r\nsituation required the intervention of two officers, and the deputy had to engage the\r\nhead of security to have a discussion with the foreperson. The court noted it was\r\nparticularly concerned with the foreperson's cussing, and was concerned with the\r\neffect his conduct may have on the other jurors given his position as foreperson.\r\nFurther, while the foreperson denied he had exhibited such behavior in the jury\r\nroom around the other jurors, he did not deny he had been cursing in the hallway\r\nabout running late and he admitted he was frustrated. Additionally, the\r\nforeperson's self-proclaimed suitability to remain on the jury is not dispositive. See\r\nid. at 43 n.4, 599 S.E.2d at 452 n.4 (noting, in a case involving removal of a juror\r\nthat did not involve removal for concealing information during voir dire, the juror's\r\nself-proclaimed impartiality was not dispositive). Based on the record before us,\r\nand recognizing the trial court was in the best position to observe the character and\r\ndemeanor of the foreperson and evaluate the situation, we find no abuse of\r\ndiscretion in the court's dismissal of the foreperson and replacement with an\r\nalternate. See State v. Thompson, 278 S.C. 1, 9, 292 S.E.2d 581, 586 (1982),\r\noverruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315,\r\n(1991) (\"Because we do not have the benefit of observing first hand the character\r\nand demeanor of the jurors as did the trial judge, we rely on his wisdom and\r\njudgment unless the record firmly establishes an abuse of discretion.\").\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, GEATHERS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-092","title":"Scott v.

He contends the statute of limitations did not begin to\r\nrun until he discovered his losses or his claims were denied, or in the alternative,\r\n\nthat the statute of limitations was equitably tolled by the filing of two lawsuits in\r\n2008.

As to whether the trial court correctly granted Fidelity National's motion to\r\ndismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP: Baird v.

As to whether Segars's claim fell outside the statute of limitations: S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 15-3-530 (2005) (providing that \"an action upon a contract, obligation, or\r\nliability, express or implied, excepting those provided for in Section 15-3-520\"\r\nmust be brought within three years of the time the cause of action accrues);\r\nEpstein v.

Beard and B. Gibbs Leaphart, Jr., both of\r\n           Sowell Gray Stepp & Laffitte, LLC, of Columbia, for\r\n           Respondents.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Appellant Patricia Johnson appeals the Appellate Panel of the\r\nSouth Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission's (the Commission) finding\r\n\nthat she did not sustain compensable injuries to her left leg and left foot when she\r\nfell while entering a doorway in the workplace. Johnson argues the Commission\r\nerred in finding her injuries did not arise out of her employment and were, instead,\r\nthe result of an idiopathic failure of the left ankle. We affirm.\r\n\r\nTo be entitled to workers' compensation benefits, a claimant must show he or she\r\nsustained an \"injury by accident arising out of and in the course of employment.\"\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-160(A) (Supp. 2013). \"'An injury arises out of employment\r\nwhen there is apparent to the rational mind, upon consideration of all the\r\ncircumstances, a causal relationship between the conditions under which the work\r\nis to be performed and the resulting injury.'\" Crisp v. SouthCo., Inc., 401 S.C. 627,\r\n641, 738 S.E.2d 835, 842 (2013) (quoting Rodney v. Michelin Tire Corp., 320 S.C.\r\n515, 518, 466 S.E.2d 357, 358 (1996)). However, an injury is excluded from\r\ncompensability under the Workers' Compensation Act when it \"cannot fairly be\r\ntraced to the employment as a contributing proximate cause and which comes from\r\na hazard to which the workmen would have been equally exposed apart from the\r\nemployment.\" Crosby v. Wal-Mart Store, Inc., 330 S.C. 489, 493, 499 S.E.2d 253,\r\n255 (Ct. App. 1998). \"The burden is on the claimant to prove such facts as will\r\nrender the injury compensable, and such an award must not be based on surmise,\r\nconjecture or speculation.\" Id. at 496, 499 S.E.2d at 257.\r\n\r\nAt the hearing before the Single Commissioner, Johnson presented evidence that\r\nthe premises surrounding the workplace were wet from recent rain, and she had to\r\nstep up and over an approximately two-inch raised threshold in order to enter the\r\nbuilding. Johnson admitted that she did not trip over the raised threshold;\r\nhowever, she testified that there wet shoeprints on the concrete floor where she\r\nfell. Contrary to Johnson's testimony, Johnson's supervisor, who did not witness\r\nthe fall, testified that the concrete floor on which Johnson fell was dry when he\r\ninspected the floor following the accident.\r\n\r\nIn this instance, there was conflicting testimony regarding whether the concrete\r\nfloor was wet. The weight to be given to witness testimony is a matter for the\r\nCommission rather than this court. Shealy v. Aiken Cnty., 341 S.C. 448, 455,\r\n535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).

Chadwick Smith, of Rock Hill, for Respondent.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: Jonathan Lake (Husband) appeals from the family court's orders\r\ngranting the parties a divorce and ruling upon his post-trial motion, arguing the\r\nfamily court erred in (1) awarding Amanda Lake (Wife) $350 per month in\r\npermanent periodic alimony, (2) awarding Wife $5,000 in attorneys' fees, (3)\r\napportioning the marital property without sufficient evidence in the record to value\r\nthe marital assets, and (4) eliminating Husband's Tuesday overnight visitation. We\r\naffirm in part and reverse in part.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nHusband and Wife married on August 24, 2002, and have two minor children. The\r\nparties separated on April 21, 2010, and a month later, Wife initiated an action for\r\nseparate support, maintenance, and other relief, although she did not plead for\r\nspousal support. The family court issued a temporary order, establishing a\r\nstandard visitation schedule, modified only by a provision giving Husband one\r\novernight visit every week. The family court ordered Husband to pay Wife\r\ntemporary child support of $1,150 per month.\r\n\r\nThereafter, Wife filed an amended complaint seeking a divorce on the ground of\r\nadultery or, alternatively, one year's separation. In her amended complaint, Wife\r\nsought an award of alimony. On January 26, 2012, the family court entered its\r\nfinal order (the Decree). The family court found both parents were fit and, in\r\naccordance with the parties' agreement, awarded the parties joint custody of the\r\nchildren, with Wife as the primary custodial parent. The Decree ordered\r\nHusband's visitation would include every other weekend, beginning on Friday after\r\nschool and ending on Wednesday morning. The Decree provided, \"The alternating\r\nweek night visitation . . . shall be eliminated in consideration of the additional days\r\nadded to his weekend visits.\" The family court required Husband to pay Wife\r\n$350 per month in permanent periodic alimony. The family court ruled each party\r\nwould receive fifty percent of the value of the marital property, as reflected in a\r\nschedule attached to the Decree. Finally, the family court required Husband to pay\r\n$5,000 toward Wife's attorneys' fees.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, Husband moved the family court to alter or amend the Decree. The\r\nfamily court modified portions of the Decree that are not the subject of this appeal,\r\nand denied Wife's request for attorneys' fees for defending against the motion to\r\nalter or amend. This appeal followed.\r\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"In appeals from the family court, [appellate courts] review[] factual and legal\r\nissues de novo.\" Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C. 412, 414, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667\r\n(2011). \"[W]hile retaining the authority to make our own findings of fact, we\r\nrecognize the superior position of the family court judge in making credibility\r\ndeterminations.\" Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 392, 709 S.E.2d 650, 655 (2011)\r\n(footnote omitted). The burden is upon the appellant to convince the appellate\r\ncourt that the preponderance of the evidence is against the family court's findings.\r\nId. \"Stated differently, de novo review neither relieves an appellant of\r\ndemonstrating error nor requires us to ignore the findings of the family court.\" Id.\r\nat 388-89, 709 S.E.2d at 654 (italics omitted). Appellate courts reviewing the\r\nequitable division of marital property do not re-weigh the apportionment factors\r\nbut review the overall apportionment for fairness. Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C.\r\n289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988) (citing Morris v. Morris, 295 S.C.\r\n37, 39-40, 367 S.E.2d 24, 25 (1988)).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Alimony\r\n\r\nHusband asserts the family court erred in awarding Wife permanent periodic\r\nalimony of $350 per month. We agree.\r\n\r\nThe family court has the authority to award alimony \"in such amounts and for such\r\nterm as the court considers appropriate as from the circumstances of the parties and\r\nthe nature of case may be just.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 20-3-130(A) (Supp. 2014). The\r\npurpose of alimony is to place the supported spouse, as close as is practical, in the\r\nsame position of support as during the marriage. Johnson, 296 S.C. at 300, 372\r\nS.E.2d at 113. However, \"[a]limony should not dissuade a spouse, to the extent\r\npossible, from becoming self-supporting.\" Rimer v. Rimer, 361 S.C. 521, 525, 605\r\nS.E.2d 572, 574 (Ct. App. 2004). In making an award of alimony, the family court\r\n\"must consider and give weight in such proportion as it finds appropriate to all of\r\nthe following factors\": (1) duration of the marriage and the ages of the parties at\r\nthe time of the marriage and separation; (2) physical and emotional condition of\r\neach spouse; (3) educational background of each spouse and the need for\r\nadditional training or education; (4) employment history and earning potential of\r\neach spouse; (5) standard of living established during the marriage; (6) current and\r\n\nreasonably anticipated earnings of both spouses; (7) current and reasonably\r\nanticipated expenses and needs of both spouses; (8) marital and nonmarital\r\nproperties of the parties; (9) custody of the children; (10) marital misconduct or\r\nfault of either or both parties; (11) tax consequences of the award; (12) any support\r\nobligation from a prior marriage or for any other reason of either party; and (13)\r\nother factors the court considers relevant. S.C. Code Ann. § 20-3-130(C) (Supp.\r\n2014). No one of these statutory factors is dispositive. Pirri v. Pirri, 369 S.C. 258,\r\n267, 631 S.E.2d 279, 284 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\n\r\nIn awarding Wife alimony, the family court stated it considered the relevant\r\nstatutory factors. It made extensive findings concerning four factors: (1) the\r\nparties' emotional conditions; (2) the parties' reasonably anticipated expenses; (3)\r\nthe standard of living established during the marriage; and (4) fault. Of these, the\r\nfamily court specified the standard of living carried \"great weight\" and fault carried\r\n\"considerable weight\" in its decision. Despite the family court's findings, we find\r\nits award of alimony to Wife was not warranted.\r\n\r\nAs to the standard of living established during the marriage and the parties' current\r\nand reasonably anticipated expenses, the record does not support the family court's\r\nconclusion that Wife would \"be hard pressed to continue or maintain that standard\r\nof living\" due to her assumption of marital debts. A review of the evidence reflects\r\nWife has sufficient income, including child support, to adequately take care of her\r\nneeds and maintain the standard of living established during the marriage. The\r\nparties' financial conditions indicate that without alimony, the parties' net monthly\r\nsurpluses above expenses are within $35 of one another:\r\n\r\n                                          Wife        Husband\r\n               Monthly earnings         $ 9,998       $ 9,923\r\n               Child Support              1,004       - 1,004\r\n               Payroll deductions       - 4,155       - 3,074\r\n               Expenses1                - 5,826       - 4,858\r\n1In addition to other debts, the parties owed $42,133 on a home equity line of\r\ncredit and $6,298 on another line of credit attached to their checking account (the\r\nWachovia Line). The family court apportioned the marital home, along with the\r\nmortgage and the home equity line of credit, to Wife and the Wachovia Line to\r\nHusband. Both parties claimed the Wachovia Line on their financial declarations.\r\nBecause the family court apportioned it to Husband, we have reduced Wife's\r\n\n               Net monthly surplus       $ 1,021      $ 987\r\n\r\nFactoring in the family court's alimony award of $350 per month, Wife would\r\nrealize $1,371 per month and Husband, $637. Additionally, we note this picture\r\nwould change significantly after Wife paid off her automobile loan. Without the\r\n$580 automobile loan payment every month2 and without alimony, Wife would\r\nrealize $1,601 per month and Husband, $987. Without the automobile loan\r\npayment, but with $350 in alimony, Wife would realize $1,951 per month and\r\nHusband, $637. Moreover, we find troubling the family court's finding that\r\nHusband may soon rely on financial contributions from his current girlfriend.\r\nAlthough Husband and his girlfriend affirmed their intent to marry and Husband\r\nadmitted his girlfriend was employed as a teacher, no evidence indicates: when the\r\nmarriage might take place; whether his girlfriend would continue working; or what\r\nobligations she would bring into the marriage. Any finding that Husband's\r\ngirlfriend's income would soon supplement Husband's is speculative.\r\n\r\nNext, the record does not support the family court's finding Husband bore the fault\r\nfor the breakup of the marriage. See § 20-3-130(C)(10) (permitting the family\r\ncourt to consider \"marital misconduct or fault of either or both parties, . . . if the\r\nmisconduct affects or has affected the economic circumstances of the parties, or\r\ncontributed to the breakup of the marriage,\" but only when the misconduct\r\noccurred before \"the earliest of (a) the formal signing of a written property or\r\nmarital settlement agreement or (b) entry of a permanent order of separate\r\nmaintenance and support or of a permanent order approving a property or marital\r\nsettlement agreement between the parties\"). While the evidence suggests\r\nHusband's misconduct may have minimally affected the economic circumstances\r\nof the parties, the evidence does not suggest it contributed to the breakup of the\r\nmarriage. Although Husband pursued a new romantic interest, the new\r\nrelationship did not begin until after Husband and Wife separated. Additionally,\r\nboth parties testified regarding their marital problems, which included arguments,\r\n\r\n$5,876 in monthly expenses by $100, the amount she claimed to be paying toward\r\nthat debt. We have added an additional $50 per month to Wife's expenses for the\r\nBelk and Ann Taylor Loft credit cards, which were omitted from her financial\r\ndeclaration.\r\n2In fact, the record reflects Wife's car loan should have been paid off by August of\r\n2012.\r\n\nWife's jealousy, and Wife's distrust, all contributing to a toxic environment for the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the remaining factors do not support the alimony award to Wife. The\r\nfamily court correctly found both parties were highly educated and had already\r\nreceived the maximum amount of training needed to reach their income potential.\r\nIt also correctly found the parties' \"substantial incomes . . . would be anticipated to\r\ncontinue or increase.\" According to the family court, the parties' \"incomes are\r\nlimited only by the hours available to them to work and their willingness to work\r\nduring those available hours.\" Wife's earnings decreased only because she reduced\r\nher working hours from forty to thirty-three per week. Husband testified he\r\nworked fifty to sixty hours each week, which was difficult, and \"would have to\r\nwork even harder\" to pay alimony. Additionally, neither party indicated\r\nanticipating a reduction in salary, a loss of job, or any other event that would\r\ndecrease their ability to earn. Furthermore, the family court erred in finding only\r\nHusband had the ability to increase his income through working overtime. The\r\nfamily court's finding Wife did not have the ability to increase her income is not\r\nsupported by the testimony. Wife testified overtime hours were unavailable at her\r\nstore because it was fully staffed. However, she conceded she could \"possibl[y]\"\r\nwork additional hours at another CVS store in her area to earn more income.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we hold the family court erred in finding (1) Husband could rely\r\nupon his girlfriend's income in the future, (2) Husband bore the fault for the\r\nbreakup of the marriage, and (3) only Husband had the ability to increase his\r\nearnings by working overtime. The family court's alimony award is reversed.\r\n\r\nII.   Attorneys' Fees\r\n\r\nHusband asserts the family court erred in awarding Wife attorneys' fees of $5,000,\r\ndespite evidence in the record she had the ability to pay and the failure of her\r\ncounsel to present evidence of the hours billed for his services. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"The decision to award attorney's fees is within the family court's sound discretion,\r\nand although appellate review of such an award is de novo, the appellant still has\r\nthe burden of showing error in the family court's findings of fact.\" Lewis v. Lewis,\r\n400 S.C. 354, 372, 734 S.E.2d 322, 331 (Ct. App. 2012).\r\n\nIn an action for separate maintenance or divorce, the family court may, \"after\r\nconsidering the financial resources and marital fault of both parties, . . . order one\r\nparty to pay a reasonable amount to the other for attorney fees.\" S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n20-3-130(H) (Supp. 2014). A family court deciding whether to award attorneys'\r\nfees should determine: \"(1) the party's ability to pay his/her own attorney's fee; (2)\r\nbeneficial results obtained by the attorney; (3) the parties' respective financial\r\nconditions; [and] (4) [the] effect of the attorney's fee on each party's standard of\r\nliving.\" E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992). A\r\ncourt awarding attorneys' fees must address six factors in determining the\r\nreasonableness of the award: \"(1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2)\r\nthe time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) professional standing of counsel; (4)\r\ncontingency of compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained; [and] (6) customary\r\nlegal fees for similar services.\" Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403\r\nS.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).\r\n\r\nWe find Wife is capable of paying her own attorneys' fees. Her gross monthly\r\nincome, including child support, is substantial. Additionally, she exercised options\r\nto purchase and sell stock in anticipation of her legal fees, for which she received\r\napproximately $11,150 after taxes and fees. Furthermore, as to the beneficial\r\nresults obtained, although the family court granted Wife a divorce on the ground of\r\nHusband's adultery and alimony of $350 per month, we have reversed the alimony\r\naward.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the factual findings concerning the reasonableness of this award were\r\nminimal at best, and the record does not support the award in all respects.\r\nAccording to the Glasscock court, the contingency of compensation, which does\r\nnot apply to family court cases, and the beneficial results obtained apply to a\r\nparty's entitlement to an award. Id. Beneficial results is the second E.D.M. factor.\r\n307 S.C. at 476, 415 S.E.2d at 816. Consequently, we need address only the\r\nGlasscock factors considering the reasonableness of the hourly rate and the number\r\nof hours billed.\r\n\r\nThe nature, extent, and difficulty of the case and the time necessarily devoted to\r\nthe case relate to the number of hours charged. Glasscock, 304 S.C. at 161, 403\r\nS.E.2d at 315. The family court stated only that it had \"considered\" each of these\r\nfactors. However, \"the family court's failure to include specific findings as to each\r\nGlasscock factor does not require reversal of an attorney's fee award, as long\r\nevidence in the record supports each factor.\" Marchant v. Marchant, 390 S.C. 1,\r\n\n13, 699 S.E.2d 708, 715 (Ct. App. 2010) (citing Townsend v. Townsend, 323 S.C.\r\n309, 318, 474 S.E.2d 424, 430 (1996)). The record reveals Wife's attorney drafted\r\ninitial and amended pleadings and proposed orders in an action for separate\r\nmaintenance that later became a divorce action, represented his client's interests in\r\nnegotiations with opposing counsel, conducted discovery, and appeared for and\r\nparticipated in a mediation and merits hearings. Wife's attorney's affidavit\r\nindicates he billed Wife $7,300 at a rate of $200 per hour. However, Wife's\r\nattorney did not provide evidence of the time he devoted to the case.\r\n\r\nThe professional standing of counsel and customary legal fees for similar services\r\npertain to the reasonableness of the hourly rate. Glasscock, 304 S.C. at 161, 403\r\nS.E.2d at 315. With respect to these factors, the family court found Wife's\r\nattorney, who frequently appeared in family court, charged \"a fraction of the\r\namount of the fees charged by [Husband's] attorney.\" Unfortunately, the record is\r\notherwise silent as to these factors. Moreover, Husband contends merely\r\ncomparing Wife's bill for attorneys' fees to his bill is insufficient to support the\r\naward. We agree. Accordingly, we reverse and remand this issue with specific\r\ninstructions to allow additional evidence on the issue of the amount of attorneys'\r\nfees and to make specific findings of fact as to each of the six Glasscock factors.\r\n\r\nIII.   Valuation of Marital Property\r\n\r\nHusband asserts the family court erred in apportioning the marital property without\r\nsufficient evidence in the record to value the marital assets. We disagree.\r\n\r\nWe find no error in the family court's valuation and apportionment of the marital\r\nassets. See Craig v. Craig, 365 S.C. 285, 290, 617 S.E.2d 359, 361 (2005) (stating\r\nthe division of marital property is within the family court's discretion and will not\r\nbe disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion); Roberson v. Roberson, 359\r\nS.C. 384, 389, 597 S.E.2d 840, 842 (Ct. App. 2004) (\"When reviewing the family\r\ncourt's equitable apportionment, 'this Court looks to the fairness of the overall\r\napportionment. If the end result is equitable, it is irrelevant that this Court might\r\nhave weighed specific factors differently than the [family court].'\" (quoting\r\nJohnson, 296 S.C. at 300, 372 S.E.2d at 113)); Roe v. Roe, 311 S.C. 471, 478, 429\r\nS.E.2d 830, 835 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding the family court is given broad discretion\r\nin valuing marital property and affirming a finding as to value that was supported\r\nby the evidence); Woodward v. Woodward, 294 S.C. 210, 215, 363 S.E.2d 413,\r\n416 (Ct. App. 1987) (affirming the family court's valuation of marital property\r\n\nwhere the value \"was well within the range\" of the evidence); Smith v. Smith, 294\r\nS.C. 194, 198-201, 363 S.E.2d 404, 407-08 (Ct. App. 1987) (holding the family\r\ncourt may accept one party's valuations of marital property over those of the other\r\nparty).\r\n\r\nIV.   Visitation\r\n\r\nHusband asserts the family court erred in eliminating his Tuesday overnight\r\nvisitation with the minor children when testimony established Wife was required to\r\nwork every Tuesday night. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe family court's decision is in the best interests of the children because it ensures\r\na more stable and consistent schedule of parenting time. The current visitation\r\nplan enables each parent to care for the children for several days at a time. In\r\ncrafting this plan, the family court adopted some aspects of the schedule\r\nestablished by a prior agreement of the parties and expanded Husband's time with\r\nthe children on alternating weekends. By the time of oral argument in this appeal,\r\nthe visitation plan had been in effect for well over two years. As a result, the best\r\ninterests of the children require that the current visitation plan remain in place. See\r\nSmith v. Smith, 386 S.C. 251, 272, 687 S.E.2d 720, 731 (Ct. App. 2009) (\"The\r\nwelfare and best interests of the child are the primary considerations in\r\ndetermining visitation. The family court has the discretion to place limitations on\r\nvisitation. In the absence of a clear abuse of discretion, the family court's order\r\nlimiting visitation rights will not be disturbed on appeal.\").\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the family court's order is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\n\r\nSHORT and WILLIAMS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-106","title":"SCDSS v.

See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2570 (2010 &\r\nSupp. 2013). The court has thoroughly reviewed the record and the family court's\r\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Ex parte Cauthen, 291 S.C.\r\n465, 354 S.E.2d 381 (1987).

Jordan, both of Gallivan,\r\n            White & Boyd, P.A., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This appeal arises from the trial court's sua sponte order granting\r\na new trial nisi remittitur pursuant to Rule 59(d), SCRCP. On appeal, Joseph\r\nWilliams argues the trial court erred by failing to provide compelling reasons for\r\nordering a remittitur and refusing to show substantial deference to the jury's\r\n\ndetermination of damages. Williams also argues the trial court issued the remittitur\r\norder without giving him notice and an opportunity to be heard on the matter.\r\nWilliams did not file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion requesting the trial court\r\naddress the allegations of error he now raises on appeal. Because the trial court's\r\nremittitur order granted relief not previously contemplated by or presented to the\r\ntrial court, we find Williams was required to file a Rule 59(e) motion to preserve\r\nhis issues for appellate review. Accordingly, both of Williams's issues on appeal\r\nare unpreserved for appellate review, and we affirm the trial court's order. See S.C.\r\nDep't of Transp. v. M & T Enters. of Mt.

Carter, and John G. Frampton, of St. George, for\r\n             Respondent Dorchester County.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Rena Brown aka Renee Brown aka Renee A. Lawrence, Eric\r\nBrown aka Eric W. Brown aka Eric Wesley Brown, Lisa Brown aka Lisa Brown\r\nHoff, Michael Enoch Brown, Karen Brown aka Karen M. Brown aka Karen\r\nMichelle Brown, and Michael C. Brown, Sr. aka Michael C. Brown aka Michael\r\nClay Brown (Appellants) appeal from the master-in-equity's order confirming a tax\r\ndeed resulting from a tax sale, arguing the master erred in: (1) not setting aside the\r\ntax deed when mailing notices of the tax sale process were not sent to two grantees\r\nof record; (2) not setting aside the tax deed when the newspaper advertisement\r\ncontained only the defaulting taxpayer; (3) ruling the grantees contained in the\r\nprobated estate were not entitled to receive notices of the tax sale process; and (4)\r\nnot granting Appellants' motion for summary judgment and motion for a new trial\r\nor to alter or to amend judgment when the taxing authority failed to include all\r\ngrantees in the tax sale process.\r\n\r\n1.       As to Appellants' argument the master erred in not setting aside the tax deed\r\nbecause mailing notices of the tax sale process were not sent to two alleged\r\ngrantees of record, we find Dorchester County properly mailed notices to Michael\r\nC. Brown, Sr., as the defaulting taxpayer and a grantee of record. See S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 12-51-40(a) (2014) (requiring notice of delinquent taxes to be made to the\r\ntaxpayer by \"mail[ing] a notice of delinquent property taxes, penalties,\r\nassessments, and costs to the defaulting taxpayer and to a grantee of record of the\r\nproperty, whose value generated all or part of the tax.\"); S.C. Code Ann. § 12-51-\r\n120 (2014) (providing \"[n]either more than forty-five days nor less than twenty\r\ndays before the end of the redemption period for real estate sold for taxes, the\r\nperson officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes shall mail a notice\r\n. . . to the defaulting taxpayer and to a grantee, mortgagee, or lessee of the property\r\nof record in the appropriate public records of the county\"). We also find\r\nAppellants have not argued on appeal that Michael C. Brown, Sr. was not the\r\ndefaulting taxpayer and a grantee of record, or that Michael C. Brown, Sr. did not\r\nreceive all the proper notices. Additionally, we find Appellants are barred from\r\nseeking to have the deed set aside because Dorchester County properly complied\r\n\nwith the tax sale statutes, and Appellants filed their complaint beyond the two-year\r\nstatute of limitations. See S.C. Code Ann. § 12-51-160 (2014) (\"An action for the\r\nrecovery of land sold pursuant to this chapter or for the recovery of the possession\r\nmust not be maintained unless brought within two years from the date of sale . . .\r\n.\").\r\n\r\n2.     As to Appellants' argument the master erred in not setting aside the tax deed\r\nbecause the newspaper advertisement contained only the defaulting taxpayer's\r\nname, we find the advertisement complied with S.C. Code Ann. § 12-51-40(d),\r\nwhich provides the advertisement must include the delinquent taxpayer's name.\r\nSee S.C. Code Ann. §12-51-40(d) (2014) (stating the property must be advertised\r\n\"in a newspaper of general circulation within the county or municipality\" and\r\n\"must include the delinquent taxpayer's name\").\r\n\r\n3.     As to Appellants' argument the master erred in ruling the grantees contained\r\nin the probated estate were not entitled to receive notices of the tax sale process,\r\nwe find Appellants abandoned this argument by failing to support it with authority.\r\nSee State v. Lindsey, 394 S.C. 354, 363, 714 S.E.2d 554, 558 (Ct. App. 2011) (\"An\r\nissue is deemed abandoned and will not be considered on appeal if the argument is\r\nraised in a brief but not supported by authority.\"); see also Broom v. Jennifer J.,\r\n403 S.C. 96, 115, 742 S.E.2d 382, 391 (2013) (finding an issue abandoned where\r\nthe party's brief cited only one family court rule, and presented no argument as to\r\nhow the family court's ruling was an abuse of discretion or constituted prejudice).\r\n\r\n4.     As to Appellants' argument the master erred in not granting Appellants'\r\nmotion for summary judgment and motion for a new trial or to alter or to amend\r\njudgment because the taxing authority failed to include all grantees in the tax sale\r\nprocess, we find Appellants' complaint was barred by the statute of limitations;\r\ntherefore, we need not address this issue. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of\r\nGeorgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an\r\nappellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of another\r\nissue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and SHORT and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-107","title":"State v.

Blitch, Jr., both of\r\n             Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\r\n             Matthew Price Turner, of Turner & Burney, PC, of\r\n             Laurens, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: A grand jury indicted Raymond Franklin for second-degree\r\nassault and battery. Franklin gave two statements to the police, and following a\r\npre-trial hearing, the trial court suppressed Franklin's second statement, finding the\r\n\nstatement was involuntary. The State appeals, arguing the trial court erred in\r\nsuppressing Franklin's second statement because the evidence in the record\r\nindicates the statement was not induced by threats or violence, obtained by any\r\ndirect or implied promises, nor was it obtained by exertion of improper influence\r\nsuch that Franklin's will was overborne. Additionally, the State contends the trial\r\ncourt erred in relying on the officers' fact suggestions to find the statement was\r\ninvoluntary. We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn August 6, 2010, Franklin met with Agent Jeff Kindly, of the State Law\r\nEnforcement Division, and gave his first statement. Kindly explained he advised\r\nFranklin of his Miranda1 rights by giving him a departmental form, including a\r\nwaiver section at the bottom of the form. Kindly averred Franklin appeared to\r\nunderstand his rights, did not have difficulty understanding the waiver form, and\r\ndid not appear to be under the influence of any alcohol or drugs at the time he\r\nsigned the form.\r\n\r\nOn August 25, 2010, Franklin voluntarily returned to the police station to submit to\r\na polygraph test. Sergeant Nate Brooks, an investigator and forensic interviewer\r\nwith the Greenville County Sheriff's Office, conducted the polygraph test with only\r\nhim and Franklin in the room. Brooks maintained he advised Franklin of his\r\nMiranda rights by providing him with a copy of the office's \"standard waiver-of-\r\nrights form\" that the office uses when conducting interviews. Brooks explained he\r\n\"basically read [the form] off to [Franklin] and asked him if he understood it, and\r\n[Franklin] said he did. And [Franklin] initialed beside each section that [Brooks]\r\nread off and then signed it down at the bottom.\" According to Brooks, Franklin\r\ndid not have any difficulty understanding his rights.\r\n\r\nAfter the polygraph test, Brooks left the room and Kindly again met with Franklin.\r\nDuring this meeting, Franklin gave his second statement. Brooks admitted there\r\nwas a two hour gap between the time Franklin signed the waiver form and time\r\nFranklin spoke with Kindly.\r\n\r\nPrior to trial, after listening to relevant portions of the August 25, 2010 recorded\r\nmeeting with Franklin, the trial court found Franklin's second statement was\r\n\r\n\r\n1   Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 444 (1966).\r\n\ninvoluntary. The trial court stated it was concerned with the officers saying things\r\nsuch as \"they're going to want to know about this, and you need to put something\r\nin there about that.\" The trial court found the officers made suggestions as to the\r\nfacts Franklin should include in the statement. Accordingly, the trial court granted\r\nFranklin's motion to suppress the second statement. When the parties returned the\r\nnext day to begin trial, the State indicated it had filed a notice of appeal and moved\r\nthe trial court for a continuance, arguing it could not properly proceed without the\r\nsuppressed statement. Franklin objected to the continuance. The trial court stated\r\nit lost its jurisdiction when the State filed its notice of appeal. Therefore, the trial\r\ncourt did not make any further rulings and the action was stayed. This appeal\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Immediately Appealable\r\n\r\nFranklin argues the trial court's order is not immediately appealable. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"An appeal ordinarily may be pursued only after a party has obtained a final\r\njudgment.\" Hagood v. Sommerville, 362 S.C. 191, 194, 607 S.E.2d 707, 708\r\n(2005). However, \"[a] pre-trial order granting the suppression of evidence which\r\nsignificantly impairs the prosecution of a criminal case is directly appealable.\"\r\nState v. McKnight, 287 S.C. 167, 168, 337 S.E.2d 208, 209 (1985). \"Under\r\nMcKnight, the State has the right to immediately appeal a trial court's suppression\r\nof evidence which significantly impairs the prosecution of the case.\" State v.\r\nBelviso, 360 S.C. 112, 115, 600 S.E.2d 68, 70 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\n\r\nFranklin's second statement provides additional details as to his interactions with\r\nthe victim. In his first statement, Franklin only admitted to kissing the victim and\r\ntouching the victim's back to view a tattoo. However, in the second statement,\r\nFranklin admits to actually touching the victim's breast, thus, confirming the\r\nvictim's claim. Therefore, the second statement is critical to prove the charges\r\nagainst Franklin, and the suppression of the statement would significantly impair\r\nthe State's case. Accordingly, we hold the trial court's order is immediately\r\nappealable. See McKnight, 287 S.C. at 168, 337 S.E.2d at 209 (holding a pre-trial\r\norder granting the suppression of evidence that significantly impairs the\r\nprosecution of a criminal case is directly appealable).\r\n\r\nII.   Voluntariness of the Second Statement\r\n\nThe State argues the trial court abused its discretion in finding Franklin's second\r\nstatement was involuntary. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"The admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not\r\nbe reversed absent an abuse of discretion.\" State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 208, 631\r\nS.E.2d 262, 265 (2006). \"An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of\r\nthe trial court either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of law.\"\r\nId. The test of voluntariness is whether a defendant's will was overborne by the\r\ncircumstances surrounding the giving of a confession. Dickerson v. United States,\r\n530 U.S. 428, 434 (2000).\r\n\r\n\"Coercive police activity is a necessary predicate to finding a statement is not\r\nvoluntary.\" State v. Miller, 375 S.C. 370, 386, 652 S.E.2d 444, 452 (Ct. App.\r\n2007). \"Coercion is determined from the perspective of the suspect.\" Id. \"A\r\nstatement may not be 'extracted by any sort of threats or violence, [or] obtained by\r\nany direct or implied promises, however slight, [or] obtained by the exertion of\r\nimproper influence.'\" Id. (alterations in original) (quoting State v. Rochester, 301\r\nS.C. 196, 200, 391 S.E.2d 244, 246 (1990)).\r\n\r\nGiven the totality of the circumstances, we find the trial court erred in finding\r\nFranklin's second statement was involuntary. State v. Parker, 381 S.C. 68, 85, 671\r\nS.E.2d 619, 627 (Ct. App. 2008). Franklin voluntarily went to the police station on\r\nboth occasions. Prior to his first statement on August 6, 2010, and his polygraph\r\ntest on August 25, 2010, the officers read Franklin his rights, and Franklin\r\nacknowledged he understood them when he placed his initials on the line next to\r\neach. The officers testified they never promised Franklin anything in return for\r\nmaking a confession and denied ever threatening him.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the conditions surrounding Franklin's confession do not indicate his\r\nstatement was induced by coercion or by an oppressive environment. Franklin was\r\npresent at the police station for approximately three hours before signing the\r\nsecond statement, which was not excessive under the circumstances. The\r\nrecording shows Franklin's general demeanor was relaxed, calm, and cooperative.\r\nFurther, when Franklin provided the second statement, he was not in a police-\r\ndominated atmosphere as only Kindly was present in the room. Likewise,\r\ncontrary to Franklin's contentions, Brooks's statements to Franklin that he was\r\nconcerned about Franklin's position at the sheriff's office, there were problems with\r\nhis answers during the polygraph examination, there were \"shades of gray\" that\r\n\nneeded to be clarified, and Franklin needed to fill in the gaps regarding the facts in\r\nthe statement, were not tantamount to coercion. Accepting as true Franklin's claim\r\nand the trial court's finding the officers suggested to Franklin that he should put\r\nsomething in his statement about the location of his touching of the victim, such\r\nsuggestion does not amount to coercion. Franklin was sixty-three years old, a\r\nformer deputy with the Laurens County Sheriff's Department with several years of\r\nexperience in law enforcement, and he provided a medical waiver to participate in\r\nthe police interviews.\r\n\r\nFinally, although Franklin appears to argue his statement is inadmissible because\r\nhe was not apprised of his Miranda rights directly before the second statement, he\r\nnever asserted he was in custody and, therefore, entitled to his Miranda rights at\r\nthe time he gave the statement. Conversely, the State maintains Franklin was\r\nnever in custody and, therefore, his Miranda rights were never triggered. State v.\r\nSilver, 314 S.C. 483, 486, 431 S.E.2d 250, 251 (1993). We find the record\r\nestablishes Franklin was not in custody at the time he gave the statement.\r\nMoreover, as previously noted, the officers advised him of the Miranda warnings\r\ntwice before he gave the second statement.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we find Franklin voluntarily gave the statement at issue. The evidence\r\npresented supports the conclusion that the State met its burden of establishing, by a\r\npreponderance of the evidence, the statement was given freely and voluntarily.\r\nAccordingly, we reverse because the trial court's suppression of Franklin's\r\nstatement was an abuse of discretion. State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. at 208, 631 S.E.2d\r\nat 265 (\"The admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and\r\nwill not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.\").\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe hold the order is immediately appealable and the totality of circumstances\r\nsurrounding Franklin's second statement establishes the trial court abused its\r\ndiscretion in finding the statement was involuntarily given and thus inadmissible at\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS and KONDUROS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-111","title":"In the Matter of Dusty A.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions//unpublishedopinions/HTMLFiles/COA/2014-UP-111.pdf","description":null,"date":"2014-03-12","type":"opinion","text":"THIS OPINION HAS NO PRECEDENTIAL VALUE.

The State indicted Morris for aiding and abetting\r\nhomicide by child abuse and his mother, Donna Lynn Phillips, for homicide by\r\n\nchild abuse. Following a joint trial, the jury found Morris and Phillips guilty as\r\ncharged. Morris argues on appeal the trial court erred by denying his motion for a\r\ndirected verdict because the State failed to present substantial circumstantial\r\nevidence of his guilt. We affirm.\r\n\r\nA person is guilty of aiding and abetting homicide by child abuse when he or she\r\n\"knowingly aids and abets another person to commit child abuse or neglect . . .\r\n[that] results in the death of a child.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 16-3-85(A)(2) (2003). We\r\naffirm the denial of Morris's directed verdict motion because the State presented\r\nsubstantial circumstantial evidence that Morris (1) knew Phillips gave the child\r\nTussionex, and (2) assisted Phillips in committing the crime. See State v. Hepburn,\r\n406 S.C. 416, __, 753 S.E.2d 402, 409 (2013) (stating when the State presents\r\n\"substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the\r\naccused, this Court must affirm the trial court's decision to submit the case to the\r\njury\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).\r\n\r\nA jury could reasonably conclude Morris had knowledge of Phillips's criminal\r\nconduct. See State v. Lewis, 403 S.C. 345, 354, 743 S.E.2d 124, 129 (Ct. App.\r\n2013) (\"[T]o be guilty as an aider or abettor, the participant must be chargeable\r\nwith knowledge of the principal's criminal conduct.\" (citation omitted)). The State\r\npresented expert medical testimony that Phillips, who had a prescription to\r\nTussionex, administered multiple doses of this medication to the child during the\r\ntime he was in Morris's custody. Morris told police he and Phillips \"were together\r\nthe entire weekend,\" and testified he was with the child \"the whole time.\"\r\nSpecifically, he stated the child \"never left [his] sight for a second,\" and slept\r\n\"right beside [Morris]\" on the couch, so he \"would know if something [had]\r\nhappen[ed] to [the child]\" during the night. This evidence supports a finding that\r\nMorris knew Phillips gave the child Tussionex because he would have observed\r\nthis occur, either multiple times or, at the very least, once. See State v. Smith, 359\r\nS.C. 481, 491, 597 S.E.2d 888, 894 (Ct. App. 2004) (affirming denial of\r\ndefendant's directed verdict motion and relying, in part, on evidence that defendant\r\nand child's mother were never separated from each other or the child when the\r\nchild's injuries occurred). Additionally, Morris testified the child began \"breathing\r\nfunny\" around 3:00 p.m. on Sunday, which prompted him to tell the child's mother\r\nthat same evening she should take him to the doctor because \"his breathing\r\nsounded bad.\" This evidence, together with the evidence discussed above and the\r\nmedical testimony that a hydrocodone overdose could cause similar symptoms\r\nobserved by Morris, constitutes substantial circumstantial evidence that Morris\r\nknew Phillips gave the child Tussionex while in his custody.\r\n\nWe also find there is substantial circumstantial evidence that Morris assisted or\r\nfacilitated Phillips in committing child abuse or neglect. See Smith, 359 S.C. at\r\n491, 597 S.E.2d at 894 (defining \"aid and abet\" as to \"[h]elp, assist, or facilitate the\r\ncommission of a crime\" (citation omitted) (alteration by court)). Morris testified\r\nhe retrieved the Tussionex for Phillips, who \"had a hard time reaching it\" due to its\r\nplacement in the closet, on Friday and Saturday. We find there is evidence that\r\nMorris's action enabled Phillips to administer the medication to the child.\r\nAdditionally, the record supports a finding that Morris assisted Phillips in causing\r\nfurther harm to the child by not seeking medical care, although the child's\r\nsymptoms were severe enough to warrant Morris calling DSS for a replacement\r\nMedicaid card and telling the child's mother to take the child to the doctor. See\r\nState v. Smith, 391 S.C. 353, 366, 705 S.E.2d 491, 498 (Ct. App. 2011) (stating\r\ndefendant's failure to seek medical care when he knew the child was abused is\r\nevidence of aiding and abetting homicide by child abuse). The State presented\r\nevidence that if the child received medical treatment Sunday night, or any time\r\nbefore, he would have lived. Finally, Morris failed to disclose to the child's\r\nmother, the first responders, or the hospital staff that the child received multiple\r\ndoses of Tussionex. A jury could reasonably infer that his failure to disclose this\r\ninformation demonstrates his guilty knowledge and attempt to cover-up the crime.\r\nWe find this evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude Morris aided and\r\nabetted Phillips in giving the child Tussionex and in failing to seek medical care.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the trial court's decision to deny Morris's directed verdict motion\r\nis AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., PIEPER and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-113","title":"State v.

Johnson, all of Columbia, for\r\n        Respondent.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: Appellant Jamaal Hinson appeals his conviction for murder,\r\narguing the trial court erred in: (1) removing a juror who unintentionally\r\nconcealed his affiliation with a witness; and (2) declining to instruct the jury on\r\ninvoluntary manslaughter. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nThis case arises from the shooting death of Anthony Salley (Victim) at the\r\nVineyard Crossing subdivision in Blythewood, South Carolina. Earlier on the day\r\nof the shooting, Appellant exchanged threats with Victim and Victim's friend,\r\nRichard Thomas, as he drove by Victim's house. Appellant testified that he\r\nsubsequently armed himself with a gun because he knew Thomas regularly carried\r\na gun. According to Appellant, he later approached Victim's driveway in an\r\nattempt to complete a drug transaction with his friend, Devan Bailey. Upon\r\nAppellant approaching the driveway, an altercation immediately began between\r\nAppellant and Victim. At some point during the altercation, Appellant drew his\r\ngun; however, Victim successfully knocked the gun from Appellant's hand. The\r\ntwo men then engaged in a fist-fight, which Appellant admittedly \"won.\" After\r\nwinning the fight, Appellant immediately retrieved his weapon. As Victim got up\r\noff the ground, he sustained a fatal gunshot wound to the abdomen from\r\nAppellant's gun. Appellant claimed that he was startled when Victim moved and\r\nfaced him and that the gun fired accidentally.\r\n\r\nThe case proceeded to trial on November 14, 2011. During voir dire, the trial\r\njudge read the name of every anticipated witness and asked each witness present to\r\nstand upon hearing his or her name called. After reading the names from the\r\nwitness list, the trial judge asked potential jurors the following questions:\r\n\r\n             Question 1: [I]s there anyone related by blood or\r\n             marriage or has [sic] a close personal or social\r\n             relationship with any of the witnesses I have called?\r\n\r\n             Question 2: Does any member of the jury panel know of\r\n             any reason whatsoever why he or she should not serve as\r\n             a juror in this case with particular emphasis placed on\r\n             your ability to be fair and impartial to both the State and\r\n             the Defendant? If so please stand.\r\n\nJuror 226, Guy Rodgers, did not respond to either question, and was subsequently\r\nplaced on the jury.\r\n\r\nOn the second day of trial, the State called Jarrod Crudup as a witness regarding\r\nAppellant's whereabouts the night of the shooting. Crudup was not present in the\r\ncourtroom on the first day of trial when the trial judge read the names on the\r\nwitness list to potential jurors. Crudup testified that he knew Victim because they\r\nlived in the same neighborhood. Crudup also stated that he \"knew of\" Appellant\r\nthrough friends and that Appellant entered his house \"uninvited\" on the day of the\r\nshooting.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the third day of trial, the trial judge informed counsel that she\r\nhad spoken to Juror 226, who had informed her that he had not recognized the\r\nnames of any of the witnesses because he did not know them, but recognized some\r\nof their faces from playing basketball with them at a local gymnasium. After the\r\ntrial judge made this announcement, Juror 226 stated that his acquaintance with\r\nsome of the witnesses would not affect his ability to be fair and impartial. The\r\nState then inquired, \"which witnesses?\" In response, Juror 226 indicated the only\r\nwitness he had knowledge of was Crudup. When specifically questioned as to\r\nwhether his knowledge of Crudup would affect his ability to be fair and impartial,\r\nJuror 226 answered \"No. I don't even know him.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Juror 226 left the courtroom, the State asked that he be removed from the\r\njury, expressing concern that Juror 226 had a close connection with a friend of\r\nAppellant. The State went on to assert that had it known about Juror 226's\r\nconnection to Crudup, the matter would have been a consideration in their use of\r\nstrikes. The trial judge recognized that Juror 226 did not intentionally conceal his\r\nrelationship with Crudup. Nevertheless, the trial judge removed Juror 226 from\r\nthe jury \"out of an abundance of caution,\" citing Juror 226's initial disclosure that\r\nhe knew of \"some of the witnesses.\"\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of trial, the jury found Appellant guilty of murder. The trial\r\njudge sentenced Appellant to thirty years' imprisonment. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Juror Dismissal\r\n\nAppellant argues the trial court committed reversible error in removing Juror 226\r\nwhen it was uncontested that Juror 226 did not intentionally conceal his knowledge\r\nof the identity of a witness during voir dire. We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn State v. Woods, 345 S.C. 583, 550 S.E.2d 282 (2001), our supreme court\r\naddressed whether a post-verdict discovery that a juror had an affiliation with a\r\nvictims' rights organization warranted a new trial. The court in Woods set forth the\r\nfollowing test for the removal of a juror for concealment of information inquired\r\ninto during voir dire:\r\n\r\n             When a juror conceals information inquired into during\r\n             voir dire, a new trial is required only when the court\r\n             finds the juror intentionally concealed the information,\r\n             and that the information concealed would have supported\r\n             a challenge for cause or would have been a material\r\n             factor in the use of the party's peremptory challenges.\r\n\r\nId. at 587, 550 S.E.2d at 284 (emphasis added). The court explained \"intentional\r\nconcealment occurs when the question presented to the jury on voir dire is\r\nreasonably comprehensible to the average juror and the subject of the inquiry is of\r\nsuch significance that the juror's failure to respond is unreasonable.\" Id. at 588,\r\n550 S.E.2d at 284. \"Unintentional concealment, on the other hand, occurs where\r\nthe question posed is ambiguous or incomprehensible to the average juror, or\r\nwhere the subject of the inquiry is insignificant or so far removed in time that the\r\njuror's failure to respond is reasonable under the circumstances.\" Id.\r\n\r\nIn State v. Stone, our supreme court cited to Woods in holding that the trial court\r\nabused its discretion by removing a juror and replacing her with an alternate. 350\r\nS.C. 442, 448-49, 567 S.E.2d 244, 247-48 (2002). In Stone, the State called the\r\ndefendant's aunt as a witness during the penalty phase of a capital trial. Id. at 448,\r\n567 S.E.2d at 247. Once the witness took the stand, one of the jurors realized she\r\nknew the witness. Id. Although the witness's name had been announced at the\r\nbeginning of the voir dire, the juror did not know the witness's name. Id. The\r\njuror indicated she had lived down the street from the witness some five or six\r\nyears earlier, but they were casual acquaintances only. Id. She further stated that\r\nher acquaintance with the witness would not affect her ability to be fair and\r\nimpartial. Id. In spite of the juror indicating that she could be impartial, the trial\r\ncourt removed the juror and replaced her with an alternate. Id. Our supreme court\r\n\nrecognized that Woods was distinguishable in that it dealt with a new trial matter;\r\nnevertheless, it found Woods \"instructive,\" noting:\r\n\r\n             It is patent here that [the juror's] failure to disclose her\r\n             acquaintance with [the witness] was innocent. Moreover,\r\n             we find her scant acquaintance would neither have\r\n             supported a challenge for cause nor would it have been a\r\n             material factor in the state's exercise of its peremptory\r\n             challenges. [The juror] clearly indicated her former\r\n             acquaintance with a witness whose name she did not\r\n             even know, would not have affected her in any way\r\n\r\nId. at 448-49, 567 S.E.2d at 247-48.\r\n\r\nThe court in Stone ruled that the trial court abused its discretion in removing the\r\njuror because neither of the two Woods criteria supporting removal were present.\r\nId. at 449, 567 S.E.2d at 248. In State v. Burgess, this court cited to Stone in\r\naffirming the trial court's decision not to remove a juror. 391 S.C. 15, 19-20, 703\r\nS.E.2d 512, 514 (Ct. App. 2010), cert. denied (May 25, 2012). The Burgess court\r\nnoted the lack of either of the Woods criteria \"would have independently rendered\r\nthe trial judge's removal of the Stone juror erroneous.\" Id. at 19, 703 S.E.2d at 514.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Appellant argues this court should find the trial court abused its\r\ndiscretion in removing Juror 226 because it is uncontested that the first Woods\r\ncriterion was absent. Appellant further contends that pursuant to Stone, the\r\nerroneous removal of a juror is per se reversible error. The State argues that\r\nAppellant's reliance on Stone is misplaced because, although Stone recognized\r\nlegal error in a similar factual scenario, Stone did not indicate a prejudice inquiry is\r\nnot required when dealing with a juror's unintentional concealment during voir\r\ndire.\r\n\r\nStone does not necessarily support Appellant's assertion that the removal of a juror\r\nwho unintentionally concealed information inquired into during voir dire requires\r\nautomatic reversal. In Stone, the appellant challenged his conviction on several\r\ngrounds, including the dismissal of a juror who unintentionally concealed her\r\nacquaintance with a witness and indicated such acquaintance would not affect her\r\nability to be fair and impartial. 350 S.C. at 448, 567 S.E.2d at 247. Although the\r\ncourt in Stone determined that the removal of the juror was an abuse of discretion,\r\nthis determination was not crucial to its ultimate holding. The Stone court held the\r\n\ntrial court's failure to instruct the jury on mitigating circumstances, as well as the\r\ntrial court's failure to give a parole ineligibility charge \"require[d] reversal.\" Id. at\r\n450, 452, 567 S.E.2d at 248, 249.\r\n\r\nNeither Stone nor Burgess address whether the erroneous removal of a juror who\r\nunintentionally concealed information during voir dire requires automatic reversal.\r\nHowever, it is well-recognized that most trial errors, even those that violate a\r\ndefendant's constitutional rights, are subject to harmless error analysis and do not\r\nautomatically require reversal of a conviction. State v. Mouzon, 326 S.C. 199, 204,\r\n485 S.E.2d 918, 921 (1997). Our courts have determined \"[t]here is no right to be\r\ntried by a jury composed of particular individuals.\" State v. McDaniel, 275 S.C.\r\n222, 224, 268 S.E.2d 585, 586 (1980); State v. Rogers, 263 S.C. 373, 382, 210\r\nS.E.2d 604, 609 (1974). In accordance with this principle, South Carolina case law\r\nconcerning alternate juror participation directs the appellate court to determine\r\nwhether an alternate juror's participation affected the outcome of the trial. See\r\nMcDaniel, 275 S.C. at 223-24, 268 S.E.2d at 586 (stating the irregular procedure\r\nemployed by the trial court in excusing a juror and impaneling an alternate at the\r\nconclusion of testimony on the basis that the juror was observed making improper\r\nremarks and gestures was not sufficient to deprive the defendant of his right to a\r\njury trial, where the alternate juror had been approved by both sides at the\r\ninception of trial, and there was no showing that defendant withdrew his approval\r\nat the time of the substitution); State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 455, 459-60, 469 S.E.2d\r\n49, 52 (1996) (finding \"[a]s in McDaniel\" there was no prejudice to the defendant\r\nfrom the seating of an alternate juror where the trial court removed a juror who was\r\nseen shaking the hand of a pastor who was seated at defense counsel's table and\r\nwho had assisted defense counsel in the case).\r\n\r\nEven if the removal of Juror 226 was error pursuant to Stone and Burgess, we find\r\nsuch error harmless. Here, the regular jurors and the alternate jurors were treated\r\nsimilarly in all respects. Juror 226 was replaced with an alternate who was present\r\nthroughout the proceeding, heard the same evidence, and was subject to the same\r\ninstructions of law as the regular jurors. See S.C. Code Ann. § 14-7-1340 (1976 &\r\nSupp. 2013) (providing alternate jurors \"shall have the same opportunities for\r\nseeing and hearing the proceedings in the case, and shall take the same oath as the\r\njurors already sworn and shall attend at all times the trial of the cause in company\r\nwith the other jurors\"). Furthermore, Appellant does not contend that the alternate\r\nwas unqualified or had not been approved by both sides during voir dire. See S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 14-7-320 (Supp. 2013) (stating alternate jurors \"must be drawn from\r\nthe same source, in the same manner, have the same qualifications, and be subject\r\n\nto the same examination and challenge as the jurors already sworn\"); see also\r\nMcDaniel, 275 S.C. at 224, 268 S.E.2d at 586.\r\n\r\nII. Involuntary Manslaughter Charge\r\n\r\nAppellant also argues the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury on\r\ninvoluntary manslaughter. We disagree.\r\n\r\nInvoluntary manslaughter is defined as (1) the unintentional killing of another\r\nwithout malice but while engaged in an unlawful activity not naturally tending to\r\ncause death or great bodily harm; or (2) the unintentional killing of another without\r\nmalice but while engaged in a lawful activity with reckless disregard for the safety\r\nof others. State v. Mekler, 379 S.C. 12, 15, 664 S.E.2d 477, 478 (2008). A trial\r\ncourt should refuse to charge the lesser-included offense of involuntary\r\nmanslaughter only where there is no evidence the defendant committed the lesser\r\noffense. Id. at 15, 664 S.E.2d at 479.\r\n\r\nHere, Appellant, a convicted felon, acted in violation of the law by carrying a\r\nfirearm. See S.C. Code Ann. § 16-23-500 (Supp. 2013). In addition to being in\r\nunlawful possession of a firearm, there is no evidence to suggest Appellant was\r\nwithout fault in bringing on the difficulty. Earlier on the day of the shooting,\r\nAppellant exchanged murderous threats with Victim in front of Victim's house. In\r\nspite of this contentious history, Appellant approached Victim's driveway while\r\ncarrying a gun. See State v. Smith, 391 S.C. 408, 414, 706 S.E.2d 12, 15-16 (2011)\r\n(holding the trial court properly refused to charge the jury on involuntary\r\nmanslaughter where there was no evidence to indicate that the appellant lawfully\r\narmed himself in self-defense given that the appellant engaged in a drug deal,\r\nwhile armed with a loaded gun, knowing the victim owed him money from a\r\nprevious drug transaction); State v. Cabrera-Pena, 361 S.C. 372, 383-84, 605\r\nS.E.2d 522, 528 (2004) (finding the appellant was not entitled to an involuntary\r\nmanslaughter charge because his conduct in arming himself with a deadly weapon\r\nand waiting to confront the victim was not a lawful activity and, his conduct, in\r\nturn, created the volatile circumstances that led to the victim's death).\r\nAccordingly, the trial court did not commit error in denying Appellant's request for\r\na charge on involuntary manslaughter.\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Appellant's conviction is AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, GEATHERS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-115","title":"Garrett v.

We affirm.\r\n\n1.     The circuit court did not err in denying Littlejohn's directed verdict motion\r\non second-degree lynching. The State presented substantial circumstantial\r\nevidence Littlejohn possessed the premeditated intent to harm Agent Matthew\r\nMorlan. See State v. Gilliland, 402 S.C. 389, 397, 741 S.E.2d 521, 525 (Ct. App.\r\n2012) (\"An appellate court reviews the denial of a directed verdict by viewing the\r\nevidence and all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most\r\nfavorable to the State.\"); State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292-93, 625 S.E.2d 641,\r\n648 (2006) (\"If there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial\r\nevidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, [an appellate court]\r\nmust find the case was properly submitted to the jury.\"). The record shows\r\nLittlejohn asked Agent Morlan to come to where the other attackers were gathered,\r\nthe assailants formed a semi-circle or \"half-moon\" around Agent Morlan, no\r\nevidence of an argument or confrontation between the parties suggest a provoked,\r\nspontaneous outburst of violence, and a distracting presence appeared at Morlan's\r\npartner's window in the seconds just prior to the assault. Taken together, these acts\r\nconstitute substantial circumstantial evidence sufficient to overcome Littlejohn's\r\ndirected verdict motion.\r\n\r\n2.     The admission of Agent Shawn Stallo's testimony he \"felt like [he] was\r\nbeing distracted,\" was not erroneous. See State v. Vang, 353 S.C. 78, 83-84, 577\r\nS.E.2d 225, 227 (Ct. App. 2003) (\"The admission or rejection of testimony is\r\nwithin the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be overturned absent a\r\nshowing of abuse of discretion, legal error, and prejudice to the appellant.\"); State\r\nv. Williams, 321 S.C. 455, 464, 469 S.E.2d 49, 54 (1996) (\"Some statements are\r\nnot mere opinions but are impressions drawn from collected observed facts.\"); id.\r\n(\"A natural inference based on stated facts is not opinion evidence.\"); id. (\"Where\r\nthe distinction between fact and opinion are blurred, it is often best to leave the\r\nmatter to the discretion of the trial judge.\").\r\n\r\n3.     We affirm the circuit court's refusal to charge the jury on simple assault and\r\nbattery, because the evidence presented did not support such a charge. See State v.\r\nKnoten, 347 S.C. 296, 302, 555 S.E.2d 391, 394 (2001) (\"The law to be charged\r\nmust be determined from the evidence presented at trial.\"); State v. Drayton, 293\r\nS.C. 417, 428, 361 S.E.2d 329, 335 (1987) (\"A trial judge is required to charge the\r\njury on a lesser[-]included offense if there is evidence from which it could be\r\ninferred the lesser, rather than the greater, offense was committed.\").

Altman, of Derfner, Altman & Wilborn,\r\n            LLC, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This appeal arises from a property dispute. On appeal, Ernest\r\nMcKnight argues the trial court erred by: (1) refusing to address the specific\r\nelements of his equitable counterclaims; (2) granting fee simple title by way of\r\nsummary judgment to Eugene Gathers; and (3) finding McKnight has no statutory\r\nright of first refusal. We dismiss in part and vacate in part.\r\n\r\n1. We find McKnight has no right to challenge the trial court's summary judgment\r\norder. A consent order of dismissal was entered wherein the parties agreed to\r\ndismiss McKnight's adverse possession counterclaim against Gathers's action to\r\nquiet title. McKnight's remaining counterclaims for reimbursement of taxes and\r\nforeclosure of mortgage were expressly unaffected by the order. Gathers filed a\r\nsummary judgment motion against all defendants in the lawsuit, except McKnight;\r\nthus, McKnight was not a named party to the motion. The order granting Gathers's\r\nmotion did not affect McKnight's counterclaims, so McKnight is not precluded\r\nfrom litigating his claims to the property. Accordingly, we find McKnight was not\r\naggrieved by the trial court's granting of fee simple title to Gathers or the trial\r\ncourt's failure to address McKnight's counterclaims. Therefore, we dismiss the\r\nportion of McKnight's appeal raising these issues. See Rule 201(b), SCACR\r\n(\"Only a party aggrieved by an order, judgment, sentence or decision may\r\nappeal.\"); Beaufort Realty Co. v. Beaufort Cnty., 346 S.C. 298, 301, 551 S.E.2d\r\n588, 589 (Ct. App. 2001) (\"The word 'aggrieved' refers to a substantial grievance, a\r\n\ndenial of some personal or property right, or the imposition on a party of a burden\r\nor obligation.\"); Burns v. Gardner, 328 S.C. 608, 617-18, 493 S.E.2d 356, 361 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1997) (dismissing the portion of an appeal involving an issue raised in which\r\nthe appellants were not aggrieved parties and thus could not pursue the issue on\r\nappeal).\r\n\r\n2. Because McKnight was not a party to the summary judgment proceeding and\r\ndid not file a motion to intervene, we find his Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion was not\r\nproperly before the trial court. In Narruhn v. Alea London Limited, 404 S.C. 337,\r\n341-42, 745 S.E.2d 90, 92 (2013), our supreme court determined an insurer's Rule\r\n60(b), SCRCP, motion was not properly before the circuit court because the insurer\r\nwas not a party to the order from which it sought relief. Even though Narruhn\r\ninvolves a Rule 60(b) motion and this case involves a Rule 59(e) motion, we find\r\nNarruhn analogous to the facts in this case. Therefore, we vacate the portion of the\r\ntrial court's Rule 59(e) order finding McKnight has no statutory right of first\r\nrefusal.1\r\n\r\nDISMISSED IN PART AND VACATED IN PART.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and PIEPER and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1  In his appellate brief, McKnight requests leave from this court to file a Rule\r\n60(b), SCRCP, motion with the trial court. Because McKnight was not a party to\r\nthe summary judgment motion, we deny McKnight's request. See Rule 60(b),\r\nSCRCP (\"During the pendency of an appeal, leave to make [a Rule 60(b)] motion\r\nmust be obtained from the appellate court.\"); Narruhn, 404 S.C. at 341-42, 745\r\nS.E.2d at 92 (finding an insurer's Rule 60(b), SCRCP, motion was not properly\r\nbefore the circuit court because the insurer was not a party to the order from which\r\nit sought relief).\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-125","title":"Child One v.

Marion, 373 S.C. 390, 401, 645 S.E.2d 245,\r\n251 (2007) (\"[I]t is not simply foreseeabilility of the victim which gives rise to a\r\nperson's liability for failure to warn; rather, it is the person's awareness of a\r\ndistinct, specific, overt threat of harm . . . .\" (quoting Gilmer v. Martin, 323 S.C.\r\n154, 157, 473 S.E.2d 812, 814 (Ct. App. 1996) )). Based on the record presented,\r\nwe cannot conclude references to remote and generalized acts of sexual\r\nmisconduct by the assailant presented a threat of harm specific enough to create a\r\nduty to warn or that the failure to warn negligently created a risk of harm to\r\nAppellants.\r\n\r\n2.     With respect to whether DSS was negligent in conducting its investigation\r\nand making a recommendation for placement, we conclude the limited record\r\nbefore us does not present any evidence to overcome summary judgment in DSS's\r\nfavor. See Snow v. City of Columbia, 305 S.C. 544, 555 n.7, 409 S.E.2d 797, 803\r\nn.7 (Ct.

While the injury in this case is apparent\r\nand tragic, the record does not contain a scintilla of direct or circumstantial\r\n\nevidence that DSS was negligent in conducting its investigation or recommending\r\nplacement of the assailant.1\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, THOMAS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1We decline to address Appellants' remaining issues.

Stevenson, of Don J. Stevenson, Attorney at Law,\r\n             of Greenville, for Guardian ad Litem.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Wanda M. (Mother) appeals the family court's order terminating\r\nher parental rights to her two minor children, Boy and Girl (collectively, Children).\r\nMother argues the family court erred in terminating her parental rights because the\r\nDepartment of Social Services (the Department) failed to prove by clear and\r\nconvincing evidence the grounds for termination of parental rights (TPR) and that\r\nTPR was in Children's best interests.\r\n\r\nThe family court may order TPR upon finding one or more of eleven statutory\r\ngrounds are satisfied and that TPR is in the best interest of the child. S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 63-7-2570 (2010 & Supp. 2013). The grounds for TPR must be proven by\r\nclear and convincing evidence. S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248,\r\n254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999). On appeal from the family court, this\r\ncourt reviews factual and legal issues de novo. Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C.\r\n412, 414, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011). Although this court reviews the family\r\ncourt's findings de novo, we are not required to ignore the fact that the trial court,\r\nwho saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their\r\ncredibility. Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 385, 709 S.E.2d 650, 652 (2011).\r\n\r\nWe find clear and convincing evidence shows Mother harmed Children while they\r\nwere residing in Mother's home, and because of the repetition of the abuse and\r\nneglect, it is not reasonably likely Mother's home can be made safe within twelve\r\nmonths. See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2570(1) (Supp. 2013) (\"The child or another\r\nchild while residing in the parent's domicile has been harmed as defined in\r\n[s]ection 63-7-20, and because of the severity or repetition of the abuse or neglect,\r\nit is not reasonably likely that the home can be made safe within twelve months. In\r\ndetermining the likelihood that the home can be made safe, the parent's previous\r\nabuse or neglect of the child or another child may be considered.\"). Here, the\r\nevidence shows Children were harmed by Mother's failure to adequately supervise\r\nthem because Boy and Girl tested positive for cocaine at twelve and fourteen years'\r\nold, respectively. Moreover, Children were harmed by Mother's failure to supply\r\nBoy with adequate mental health care. Specifically, Mother's failure to ensure\r\nBoy's prescription medications were filled and her failure to keep Boy's mental\r\nhealth appointments contributed to Boy's numerous violent outbursts, including an\r\nincident when Boy chased Girl around Mother's home with a knife. See S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 63-7-20(4) (2010) (defining \"harm\" as occurring \"when the\r\n\nparent . . . inflicts or allows to be inflicted upon the child physical or mental injury\r\nor engages in acts or omissions which present a substantial risk of physical or\r\nmental injury to the child[;] . . . [or] fails to supply the child with . . . supervision\r\nappropriate to the child's age and development, or health care . . . and the failure to\r\ndo so has caused or presents a substantial risk of causing physical or mental\r\ninjury.\"). Further, we find clear and convincing evidence shows that because of\r\nthe repetition of the abuse and neglect, it is not reasonably likely Mother's home\r\ncan be made safe within twelve months. See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2570(1)\r\n(Supp. 2013). We find Mother's extensive history with DSS and the family court's\r\nnumerous findings of abuse and neglect against Mother show Mother's home\r\ncannot be made safe within twelve months. See id. (allowing the court to consider\r\nthe parent's previous abuse or neglect of the child or another child in determining\r\nthe likelihood that the home can be made safe).\r\n\r\nBecause we find clear and convincing evidence exists to affirm TPR based on\r\nsection 63-7-2570(1) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2013), we decline to\r\naddress the issue of whether clear and convincing evidence exists to affirm TPR\r\nbased on section 63-7-2570(6). See S.C. Dept. of Soc. Servs. v. Seegars, 367 S.C.\r\n623, 633-34, 627 S.E.2d 718, 723-24 (2006) (declining to address remaining issues\r\nregarding TPR grounds where the court found clear and convincing evidence\r\nexisted to affirm TPR on a different ground).\r\n\r\nFinally, we find clear and convincing evidence establishes TPR is in Children's\r\nbest interests. S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Smith, 343 S.C. 129, 133, 538 S.E.2d\r\n285, 287 (Ct. App. 2000) (\"In a termination of parental rights case, the best\r\ninterests of the children are the paramount consideration.\"). Throughout Mother's\r\nlong history with the Department, Children have been removed from her custody\r\nthree times, and they have spent the majority of their lives in the Department's\r\ncustody. Importantly, Children's last two removals occurred only a short time after\r\nChildren were returned to Mother's custody. While we recognize the challenges\r\nthat exist in placing Children, who are now teenagers, in adoptive homes, the\r\nevidence shows Children will be in a safer, more stable environment if they remain\r\nin the Department's custody. See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2620 (2010) (\"[The TPR\r\nstatute] must be liberally construed in order to ensure prompt judicial procedures\r\nfor freeing minor children from the custody and control of their parents by\r\nterminating the parent-child relationship.

On appeal, DSS argues (1) it\r\npresented sufficient evidence to support the statutory grounds for termination of\r\nparental rights (TPR) as to Mother—in particular, the grounds of (a) severity and\r\nrepetition of the abuse or neglect and (b) failure to remedy the conditions causing\r\nthe removal; (2) the family court erred in failing to rule on the termination of the\r\nChildren's fathers' parental rights; and (3) the family court erred in failing to\r\naddress Children's best interests. We affirm in part and remand.\r\n\r\nOn appeal from the family court, this court reviews factual and legal issues de\r\nnovo. Argabright v. Argabright, 398 S.C. 176, 179, 727 S.E.2d 748, 750 (2012).\r\nThe grounds for TPR must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. S.C. Dep't\r\nof Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\n\"Upon review, the appellate court may make its own finding from the record as to\r\nwhether clear and convincing evidence supports [TPR].\" S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs.\r\nv. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 609, 582 S.E.2d 419, 423 (2003). However, despite our\r\nbroad scope of review, this court is not required to ignore the fact the family court,\r\nwhich saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their\r\ncredibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony. Lewis v. Lewis, 392\r\nS.C. 381, 388, 709 S.E.2d 650, 653 (2011).\r\n\r\nThe family court may order TPR upon finding one or more of eleven statutory\r\ngrounds is met and finding TPR is in the child's best interests. S.C. Code Ann.\r\n§ 63-7-2570 (2010 & Supp. 2013). \"In a TPR case, the best interest of the child is\r\nthe paramount consideration.\" Charleston Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Jackson,\r\n368 S.C. 87, 95, 627 S.E.2d 765, 770 (Ct. App. 2006). \"The interests of the child\r\nshall prevail if the child's interest and the parental rights conflict.\" S.C. Code Ann.\r\n§ 63-7-2620 (2010).\r\n\r\n\"[P]rocedural rules are subservient to the court's duty to zealously guard the rights\r\nof minors.\" Joiner ex rel. Rivas v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 107, 536 S.E.2d 372, 374\r\n(2000). \"[The] duty to protect rights of minors has precedence over procedural\r\n\nrules otherwise limiting the scope of review[,] and matters affecting the rights of\r\nminors may be considered by an appellate court for the first time on appeal or even\r\non its own motion.\" Ex parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 65, 624 S.E.2d 649, 654 (2006)\r\n(citing Ex parte Roper, 254 S.C. 558, 563, 176 S.E.2d 175, 177 (1970)).\r\n\r\nHaving conducted a de novo review of the record, we affirm the family court's\r\nfinding that DSS failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence any statutory\r\ngrounds for TPR as to Mother. See S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Sarah W., 402 S.C.\r\n324, 335, 741 S.E.2d 739, 745 (2013) (\"[W]hen DSS seeks TPR pursuant to\r\nsection 63-7-2570, the allegations supporting that termination must be proved by\r\nclear and convincing evidence.\").\r\n\r\nThe record does not contain clear and convincing evidence Mother abused or\r\nneglected Children and it was unlikely her home could be made safe within twelve\r\nmonths. See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2570(1) (Supp. 2013) (stating a statutory\r\nground for TPR is met if the children have been harmed while living in the parent's\r\nhome, \"and because of the severity or repetition of the abuse or neglect, it is not\r\nreasonably likely that the home can be made safe within twelve months\"). Mother\r\ncompleted parenting classes, improved the child safety features of her house, and\r\nsubmitted photographs of her house showing it was no longer cluttered. A DSS\r\ncaseworker testified she visited Mother's home and acknowledged Mother fixed\r\nthe safety hazards in her home. Mother's neighbor testified she did not believe\r\nChildren had ever been in an unsafe environment. Additionally, Mother regularly\r\nvisited her other children, and these visits were unsupervised.\r\n\r\nAlthough DSS alleged Mother was in a relationship with a registered sex offender,\r\nthe evidence regarding this allegation was inconclusive. See Shake v. Darlington\r\nCnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 306 S.C. 216, 221, 410 S.E.2d 923, 925 (Ct. App. 1991)\r\n(\"The evidence on this issue is, at best, sketchy and is inadequate to meet the\r\nstandard required to terminate parental rights.\"). Similarly, although the\r\ncircumstances surrounding the youngest child's burn incident are troubling, we\r\ndefer to the family court's evaluation of Mother's credibility in finding the child's\r\ninjuries \"were accidental and do not appear to be intentionally inflicted.\" See\r\nLewis, 392 S.C. at 388, 709 S.E.2d at 653 (stating an appellate court is not required\r\nto ignore the fact the family court, which saw and heard the witnesses, was in a\r\nbetter position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their\r\ntestimony). Therefore, we find DSS did not present clear and convincing evidence\r\nto support this ground for TPR.\r\n\nThe record also does not contain clear and convincing evidence Mother failed to\r\nremedy the conditions that caused the removal of Children. See S.C. Code Ann.\r\n§ 63-7-2570(2) (2010) (stating a statutory ground for TPR is met if the children\r\nhave been removed from the parent's home for a period of six months, and during\r\nthat time the parent did not remedy the conditions that caused the removal).\r\nMother improved the child safety features of her house, completed parenting and\r\nanger management classes, obtained full-time employment, and secured her own\r\nhousing. She paid for and obtained a psychological evaluation and habitually paid\r\nchild support, albeit every fifth month. Finally, Mother attended most visits with\r\nChildren, despite not having transportation to some visits. See Loe v. Mother,\r\nFather, & Berkeley Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 382 S.C. 457, 459, 468-69, 675\r\nS.E.2d 807, 809, 813 (Ct. App. 2009) (finding the mother remedied the conditions\r\nthat caused her children's removal because she regularly visited her children and\r\ncompleted a placement plan requiring her to maintain employment and pay child\r\nsupport). Therefore, we find Mother remedied the conditions that caused\r\nChildren's removal.\r\n\r\nBecause no statutory ground supports termination of Mother's parental rights, we\r\nneed not consider whether terminating Mother's parental rights would be in\r\nChildren's best interests. See Stinecipher v. Ballington, 366 S.C. 92, 101 n.7, 620\r\nS.E.2d 93, 98 n.7 (Ct. App. 2005) (\"[A] family court need not reach best interest\r\nwhen no ground for termination exists.\"); Loe, 382 S.C. at 471, 675 S.E.2d at 815\r\n(\"Because no statutory ground supports termination of Mother's parental rights to\r\nDaughter or Son, we need not consider whether terminating Mother's rights would\r\nbe in her children's best interests.\"). Thus, we affirm the family court's order to the\r\nextent it denied TPR as to Mother.\r\n\r\nHowever, we remand this case so the family court can issue specific rulings\r\nregarding the fathers' parental rights. See generally S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v.\r\nVanderhorst, 287 S.C. 554, 561, 340 S.E.2d 149, 153 (1986) (remanding a TPR\r\ncase and directing the family court to conduct a rehearing on the issues of whether\r\na mother's children should be removed from her custody and whether her parental\r\nrights should be terminated). In its final order, the family court denied TPR as to\r\nMother and included the following footnote: \"The [c]ourt did not rule on the\r\ntermination of parental rights case as it pertains to the defendant/fathers.\" Besides\r\ndismissing Christopher A. from all future actions concerning Children, the family\r\ncourt made no rulings regarding Christopher A.'s, Hector S.'s, Christopher M.'s,\r\nand Odel S.'s individual parental rights. Therefore, we remand for a determination\r\nof these fathers' parental rights.\r\n\nOn remand, the family court must determine whether any statutory grounds for\r\nTPR were met as to any of Children's fathers, and if so, whether TPR of any of the\r\nfathers is in Children's best interests. See id. (\"On remand, the best interests of the\r\nchildren shall, of course, continue to be the paramount consideration.\").\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the order of the family court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REMANDED.1\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, KONDUROS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1   We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-126","title":"Bryant-Perreira v.

McWhorter, Rogers\r\n            Townsend & Thomas, PC, all of Columbia, for\r\n            Respondent Genoa Construction.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this construction defect case, the 3 Chisolm Street\r\nHomeowners Association, Inc. (the \"HOA\") brought suit in 2009 against several\r\ndefendants that completed construction work on three condominium buildings in\r\n2002, including the respondents—Genoa Construction Services, Inc., the general\r\ncontractor, Masterpiece Millwork, Inc., the manufacturer of the windows used in\r\nthe buildings, and Brock Green Architects and Planners, LLC, the architect. The\r\n\ncircuit court granted summary judgment to the respondents on claims related to\r\noriginal construction work based on the statute of limitations. We affirm.\r\n\r\nSection 15-3-530 of the South Carolina Code (2005) sets forth a three-year statute\r\nof limitations for actions based in negligence and contract. See § 15-3-530(1) and\r\n(5) (providing for a three-year statute of limitations for \"an action upon a contract\"\r\nand \"an action for . . . any injury . . . not arising on contract and not enumerated by\r\nlaw\"). In determining when the statute of limitations began to run, the circuit court\r\napplied the \"discovery rule,\" which provides that the time to file a claim \"begins to\r\nrun when a cause of action reasonably ought to have been discovered.\" Dean v.\r\nRuscon Corp., 321 S.C. 360, 363, 468 S.E.2d 645, 647 (1996). The HOA argues\r\nthere are material issues of fact as to when the HOA discovered, or should have\r\ndiscovered, that a cause of action existed for original construction defects in all\r\nthree condominium buildings—the main building, the gym building, and the\r\ncottage building.\r\n\r\nAs to the main building, we find the circuit court properly determined the statute of\r\nlimitations began to run in 2003 because the Glick report, issued in April 2003, put\r\nthe HOA on inquiry notice of defects that would have been discoverable through\r\nadditional inspections and destructive testing, which both the report and the HOA\r\npresident recommended. See Republic Contracting Corp. v. S.C. Dep't of\r\nHighways & Pub. Transp., 332 S.C. 197, 207, 503 S.E.2d 761, 766 (Ct. App.\r\n1998) (stating the statute of limitations begins to run \"from the date the injury is\r\ndiscoverable by the exercise of reasonable diligence\"); 332 S.C. at 208, 503 S.E.2d\r\nat 767 (holding the plaintiff \"had sufficient information . . . to put it on inquiry\r\nnotice, which, if developed, would have revealed the defects\"). The Glick report\r\nalso triggered the statute of limitations for claims against all three respondents\r\nbecause the report listed specific defects that put the HOA on inquiry notice to\r\ndiscover whether those defects were attributable to design, construction, or\r\nmanufacturing errors. See Barr v. City of Rock Hill, 330 S.C. 640, 645, 500 S.E.2d\r\n157, 160 (Ct. App. 1998) (stating a party has notice of claims when the facts and\r\ncircumstances \"would put a person of common knowledge and experience on\r\nnotice that . . . some claim against another party might exist\" (internal quotation\r\nmarks and citation omitted) (emphasis in original)); Wiggins v. Edwards, 314 S.C.\r\n126, 128, 442 S.E.2d 169, 170 (1994) (\"The focus is upon the date of discovery of\r\nthe injury, not the date of discovery of the wrongdoer.\"); id. (\"If, on the date of\r\ninjury, a plaintiff knows or should know that she had some claim against someone\r\nelse, the statute of limitations begins to run for all claims based on that injury.\"\r\n(citation omitted)).\r\n\nAs to the gym and cottage buildings, we find the circuit court correctly found\r\nGlick's report provided the HOA sufficient information to put it on inquiry notice\r\nof construction defects existing in these buildings. See Dean, 321 S.C. at 364, 468\r\nS.E.2d at 647 (stating \"the fact that the injured party may not comprehend the full\r\nextent of the damage is immaterial\"); Republic, 332 S.C. at 208, 503 S.E.2d at 767.\r\nSpecifically, Glick's report put the HOA on inquiry notice of defects in the gym\r\nand cottage buildings because:\r\n\r\n   (1)\t   all three buildings were built at the same time, by the same general\r\n          contractor, and in accordance with the same plans developed by the same\r\n          architect;\r\n   (2)\t   the minutes from the board of directors meeting in May 2003 provide that\r\n          after receiving Glick's report, the board discussed \"steps that should be\r\n          followed,\" including \"[i]nspection of the cottage and gym building[s]\";\r\n   (3)\t   the minutes from the board of directors meeting in June 2003\r\n          demonstrate the HOA solicited proposals from companies for \"additional\r\n          investigation\" into the defects highlighted in Glick's report, although it\r\n          ultimately decided not to pursue this course of action due to the cost;\r\n   (4)\t   the HOA was urged to conduct further investigations by Glick, who\r\n          warned of \"significant and pervasive construction defect problems\"; and\r\n   (5)\t   an inspection report shows the HOA undertook remedial measures on the\r\n          gym building some time before 2007 \"in an effort to inhibit water\r\n          intrusion at windows.\"\r\n\r\nThere is also evidence that if the HOA had exercised reasonable diligence and\r\ninvestigated the other buildings in 2003, it would have discovered the defects\r\nbefore the statute of limitations ran. Barr, 330 S.C. at 645-46, 500 S.E.2d at 160\r\n(holding had the plaintiffs \"exercised reasonable diligence and investigated the\r\nproblems noted in the . . . inspection reports, they could have realized the\r\nmagnitude of the problem and brought suit before the statute of limitations ran\").\r\nAn inspection report issued in 2007 that concerned the gym and cottage buildings\r\nalerted the HOA to defects that existed in 2003 and would have been discoverable.\r\nMoreover, according to an architect who inspected the buildings, the deterioration\r\nof the wooden windows in the gym building resulted, in part, from condensation\r\nbuildup on the windows, which would \"have been occurring prior to [his]\r\nobservations\" in 2007 because it was caused by installation of single-pane\r\nwindows. Thus, the defect causing the condensation—the single-pane windows—\r\nexisted at the time construction was completed in 2002.\r\n\nThe HOA also argues it \"thought the problems [in the main building] had been\r\nrepaired\" by Genoa in 2004, which tolled the statute of limitations as to original\r\nwork performed by Genoa. We find the issue is not properly before this court, as\r\nthe HOA raised this issue for the first time in its reply brief. See Rule\r\n208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (\"[N]o point will be considered which is not set forth in the\r\nstatement of the issues on appeal.\"); Glasscock, Inc. v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co., 348\r\nS.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d 689, 692 (Ct. App. 2001) (stating \"an argument made in a\r\nreply brief cannot present an issue to the appellate court if it was not addressed in\r\nthe initial brief\").1\r\n\r\nBecause we affirm on the merits of the circuit court's conclusion that the statute of\r\nlimitations bars the HOA's claims, we decline to address other grounds on which\r\nsummary judgment was granted. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown,\r\nInc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (declining to address\r\nappellant's remaining issues when disposition of a prior issue was dispositive).2\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., SHORT and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Additionally, we find no merit to this argument. The HOA bases this assertion\r\non language in the circuit court's order that stated the statute of limitations for\r\noriginal construction work \"has tolled.\" We do not interpret the court's use of the\r\nword \"tolled\" as invoking the doctrine of equitable estoppel, but instead as a\r\nfinding that the statute of limitations expired as to all claims related to original\r\nwork. This conclusion is supported by (1) the context in which the court made this\r\nstatement; (2) the fact that the HOA did not assert equitable estoppel before the\r\ncourt made this ruling; and (3) the ultimate holding that the statute of limitations\r\nbarred the HOA's claims regarding original work.\r\n2 Genoa also raises an issue in its brief regarding the circuit court's application of\r\nthe \"continuous treatment exception.\" We decline to address this argument, as it\r\nwas never raised to the circuit court.

CSX Transp., Inc., 362 S.C. 456,\r\n482, 609 S.E.2d 286, 299 (2005) (finding issue not preserved because it was not\r\nraised to and ruled upon by the trial court).\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-130","title":"City of Rock Hill v.

Clark, of Greenville, for the Guardian ad\r\n             Litem.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Michael B. (Father) appeals the family court's termination of his\r\nparental rights to his minor child (Child), arguing clear and convincing evidence\r\ndoes not support terminating parental rights (TPR) based on (1) wilful failure to\r\nvisit; (2) wilful failure to support; (3) foster care for fifteen of the last twenty-two\r\nmonths; and (4) abandonment. Father also argues TPR was not in Child's best\r\ninterest. We affirm.\r\n\r\nThe family court may order TPR upon finding one or more of eleven statutory\r\ngrounds is satisfied and TPR is in the best interest of the child. S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n63-7-2570 (2010 & Supp. 2013). The grounds for TPR must be proven by clear\r\nand convincing evidence. S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254,\r\n519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999). \"In appeals from the family court, this\r\n[c]ourt reviews factual and legal issues de novo.\" Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C.\r\n412, 414, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011). Although this court reviews the family\r\ncourt's findings de novo, we are not required to ignore the fact that the family\r\ncourt, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their\r\ncredibility. Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 385, 709 S.E.2d 650, 652 (2011).\r\n\r\nI. Wilful Failure to Visit\r\n\r\nWe find clear and convincing evidence shows Father wilfully failed to visit Child.\r\nSee S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2570(3) (2010) (stating a statutory ground for TPR is\r\nmet if the child has been out of the home for a period of six months and the parent\r\nhas wilfully failed to visit the child). Father acknowledges Child lived outside of\r\nhis home for over six months and he did not visit Child, but he argues his failure to\r\nvisit was not wilful due to his medical conditions, lack of money, and the distance\r\nbetween Oklahoma and South Carolina. However, Father chose to move to\r\nOklahoma, and he was employed and healthy during his first few months there.\r\nFurthermore, Father did not make an effort to keep in touch with Child through\r\nphone calls or letters, despite encouragement from DSS caseworkers. See S.C.\r\nDep't of Soc. Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 611, 582 S.E.2d 419, 424 (2003)\r\n(holding a mother's failure to visit was wilful because she chose to move to another\r\nstate for a job after her child's removal and \"made little effort to no effort to\r\nmaintain a relationship with the [c]hild with letters or phone calls when physical\r\n\nvisits were not possible\"). Accordingly, we find Father wilfully failed to visit\r\nChild.\r\n\r\nII. Wilful Failure to Support\r\n\r\nWe also find clear and convincing evidence shows Father wilfully failed to support\r\nChild. See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2570(4) (2010) (stating a statutory ground for\r\nTPR is met if \"[t]he child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period of\r\nsix months, and during that time the parent has wilfully failed to support the\r\nchild\"). Father was ordered to pay $284 each month in child support. Father\r\nadmits he never made any monetary contributions but states he sent Child two or\r\nthree gifts. We find these intermittent gifts do not constitute a material\r\ncontribution. See id. (\"Failure to support means that the parent has failed to make a\r\nmaterial contribution to the child's care.\"); S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. M.R.C.L.,\r\n393 S.C. 387, 394, 712 S.E.2d 452, 456 (2011) (finding a mother's occasional\r\ncontribution of toys and other items was not a material contribution). Although\r\nFather asserts his failure to support was not wilful due to his medical conditions\r\nand lack of income, Father failed to pay any support when he was employed and\r\nhealthy for the first few months after Child's removal. Further, Father never\r\nrequested a reduction in his child support obligation due to his disability and never\r\nsought to receive Social Security benefits on behalf of Child. See S.C. Dep't of\r\nSoc. Servs. v. Seegars, 367 S.C. 623, 630-31, 627 S.E.2d 718, 722 (2006) (holding\r\na mother's \"failure to pay court-ordered child support or give a reasonable excuse\r\nfor her failure to pay manifest[ed] a conscious indifference to the rights of [her\r\nc]hildren to receive support\" and constituted a wilful failure to support).\r\nAccordingly, we find Father wilfully failed to support Child.\r\n\r\nIII. Foster Care for Fifteen of the Last Twenty-Two Months\r\n\r\nWe also find clear and convincing evidence shows Child was in foster care for\r\nfifteen of the last twenty-two months. See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2570(8) (2010)\r\n(stating a statutory ground is met if \"[t]he child has been in foster care under the\r\nresponsibility of the State for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months\").\r\nAlthough it is undisputed Child lived in foster care for more than fifteen months,\r\nFather argues the family court erred in recognizing this statutory ground because\r\nthe delay was not attributable to him. See Charleston Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v.\r\nMarccuci, 396 S.C. 218, 227, 721 S.E.2d 768, 773 (2011) (\"Where there is\r\nsubstantial evidence that much of the delay . . . is attributable to the acts of others,\r\na parent's rights should not be terminated based solely on the fact that the child has\r\n\nspent greater than fifteen months in foster care.\" (alteration in original) (citations\r\nand internal quotation marks omitted)). However, Father failed to take the\r\nnecessary steps to gain custody, and DSS found his home was not suitable after\r\nconducting a home study. Therefore, we find the delay in reunification was not\r\nattributable to DSS. See S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Sarah W., 402 S.C. 324, 342-\r\n43, 741 S.E.2d 739, 749 (2013) (holding clear and convincing evidence supported\r\nTPR on the ground that the child had been in foster care for fifteen of the most\r\nrecent twenty-two months because the mother was primarily responsible for the\r\ndelays in the case by failing to remedy the conditions that caused removal).\r\nAccordingly, we find clear and convincing evidence supports TPR on this ground.1\r\n\r\nIV. Best Interest\r\n\r\nWe find clear and convincing evidence supports the family court's finding that\r\nTPR is in Child's best interest. See S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Smith, 343 S.C. 129,\r\n133, 538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct. App. 2000) (stating the best interest of the child is\r\n\"the paramount consideration\"). Although Father states he has a stable home and\r\nis ready to care for Child, Father failed a home study. Additionally, Father has not\r\nmaintained a relationship with Child, and he has failed to visit or support her since\r\nher removal.\r\n\r\nChild's developmental needs are also a significant factor. Child is diagnosed on\r\nthe autism spectrum and will need a stable home and services such as speech\r\ntherapy on a regular basis. Although Father acknowledged Child's diagnosis, he\r\nstated he did not agree with it and thought Child might have attention deficit\r\nhyperactivity disorder. The DSS caseworker and the GAL expressed concern\r\nabout Father's lack of understanding of the diagnosis and his ability to meet Child's\r\ndevelopmental needs. Moreover, Child is in a stable pre-adoptive home, where the\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Because three statutory grounds were proven, we need not address the remaining\r\nground of abandonment and will move forward with an analysis of Child's best\r\ninterest. See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2570 (2010 & Supp. 2013) (\"The family court\r\nmay order [TPR] upon a finding of one or more of the [statutory] grounds and a\r\nfinding that [TPR] is in the best interest of the child . . . .\"); Stinecipher v.\r\nBallington, 366 S.C. 92, 100 & n.6, 620 S.E.2d 93, 98 & n.6 (Ct. App. 2005)\r\n(declining to rule on an additional statutory ground after its dispositive ruling on\r\nthe ground of wilful failure to support).\r\n\nGAL observed Child make significant progress and blossom under the care of her\r\nfoster parents. Accordingly, we find clear and convincing evidence shows TPR is\r\nin Child's best interest.\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we affirm the family court's order terminating Father's\r\nparental rights.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.2\n\r\n\r\nHUFF and THOMAS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur. \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2   We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-164","title":"SCDSS v.

P. (Mother) appeals the family court's termination\r\nof her parental rights to her minor son (the child), arguing clear and convincing\r\nevidence does not support terminating parental rights (TPR) based on (1) severe or\r\nrepetitious harm that made it reasonably unlikely the home could be made safe and\r\n(2) a diagnosable condition unlikely to change. Mother also argues TPR was not in\r\nthe child's best interest. We affirm.\r\n\r\nThe family court may order TPR upon finding one or more of eleven statutory\r\ngrounds is satisfied and TPR is in the best interest of the child. S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n63-7-2570 (2010 & Supp. 2013). The grounds for TPR must be proven by clear\r\nand convincing evidence. S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254,\r\n519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999). \"In appeals from the family court, this\r\n[c]ourt reviews factual and legal issues de novo.\" Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C.\r\n412, 414, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011). Although this court reviews the family\r\ncourt's findings de novo, we are not required to ignore the fact that the family\r\ncourt, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their\r\ncredibility. Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 385, 709 S.E.2d 650, 652 (2011).\r\n\r\nWe find clear and convincing evidence supports TPR based on harm. A statutory\r\nground for TPR is met when the child has been harmed \"and because of the\r\nseverity or repetition of the abuse or neglect, it is not reasonably likely that the\r\nhome can be made safe within twelve months.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2570(1)\r\n(2010). Harm occurs when a parent \"engages in acts or omissions which present a\r\nsubstantial risk of physical or mental injury to the child.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-\r\n20(4)(a) (2010). Harm also occurs when a parent \"fails to supply the child with . . .\r\nsupervision appropriate to the child's age and development.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 63-\r\n7-20(4)(c) (2010). We find the child was harmed when Mother left him\r\nunsupervised for an extended period of time and neighbors found him in an\r\nextremely soiled diaper. He was harmed a second time when Mother's abuse of\r\nmarijuana caused him to test positive for marijuana. Although Mother completed\r\ndrug treatment and parenting classes, she failed to attend mental health counseling\r\nbetween January 2011 and January 2012. The medical records submitted by the\r\nSouth Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) showed Mother had a severe\r\nmental condition that required medication and counseling. Specifically, they\r\nindicated Mother attempted suicide and engaged in self-mutilation, she \"hear[d]\r\n\nvoices telling [her] to do bad things,\" she experienced hallucinations, and she \"hit\r\nher sister for no reason when [she was] frustrated.\" The initial clinical assessment\r\nstated, \"[Mother] needs counseling to help her make wise choices for her [and] her\r\nbaby.\" Despite her mental condition, Mother admitted she failed to attend mental\r\nhealth counseling between January 2011 and January 2012, and she stated\r\nSpartanburg Area Mental Health Center closed her case because she missed too\r\nmany appointments. Based on the severity of Mother's mental condition and\r\nMother's failure to obtain consistent treatment, we find clear and convincing\r\nevidence shows Mother was not reasonably likely to make her home safe within\r\ntwelve months.\r\n\r\nWe also find clear and convincing evidence supports TPR based on Mother's\r\ndiagnosable condition. A statutory ground for TPR is met when the parent has a\r\ndiagnosable condition unlikely to change in a reasonable time that prevents the\r\nparent from providing minimally acceptable care. S.C. Code Ann. §63-7-2570(6)\r\n(2010). \"When the diagnosable condition alleged is mental deficiency, there must\r\nbe clear and convincing evidence that: (1) the parent has a diagnosed mental\r\ndeficiency, and (2) this deficiency makes it unlikely that the parent will be able to\r\nprovide minimally acceptable care of the child.\" S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Roe,\r\n371 S.C. 450, 456, 639 S.E.2d 165, 168-69 (Ct. App. 2006). Dr. Catherine\r\nKreiser, a psychiatrist with the Spartanburg Area Mental Health Center, testified\r\nMother suffered from undifferentiated schizophrenia, a \"treatable, but not curable\"\r\ncondition; thus, DSS proved the first prong of Roe. Although Dr. Kreiser did not\r\nexplicitly testify Mother's condition made it unlikely she would ever be able to\r\nprovide minimally acceptable care to the child, she testified the symptoms of\r\nschizophrenia could return if a patient did not receive counseling or take\r\nmedication, and one of the symptoms that could return was \"not really being in\r\ntouch with reality.\" Dr. Kreiser further testified a minor child could be at risk if his\r\nparent was not in touch with reality. Finally, Dr. Kreiser testified Mother had a\r\nhistory of missing appointments at Spartanburg Area Mental Health Center.\r\nMother admitted she did not attend counseling between January 2011 and January\r\n2012. Dr. Kreiser's testimony indicating Mother's condition was \"treatable, but not\r\ncurable,\" Mother's medical records detailing the history of her mental illness,\r\nMother's history of missing appointments, and Dr. Kreiser's testimony establishing\r\na minor child could be at risk if his parent experienced symptoms of schizophrenia,\r\ncumulatively establish clear and convincing evidence showing Mother's\r\nschizophrenia made it unlikely she would ever be able to provide minimally\r\nacceptable care to the child.\r\n\nFinally, we find clear and convincing evidence shows TPR is in the child's best\r\ninterest. \"The purpose of [the TPR statute] is to establish procedures for the\r\nreasonable and compassionate [TPR] where children are abused, neglected, or\r\nabandoned in order to protect the health and welfare of these children and make\r\nthem eligible for adoption . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2510 (2010). In a TPR\r\ncase, the best interest of the child is the paramount consideration. S.C. Dep't of\r\nSoc. Servs. v. Smith, 343 S.C. 129, 133, 538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\n\"The interest[] of the child shall prevail if the child's interest and the parental rights\r\nconflict.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2620 (2010). \"Appellate courts must consider\r\nthe child's perspective, and not the parent's, as the primary concern when\r\ndetermining whether TPR is appropriate.\" S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Sarah W.,\r\n402 S.C. 324, 343, 741 S.E.2d 739, 749-50 (2013). \"The termination of the legal\r\nrelationship between natural parents and a child presents one [of] the most difficult\r\nissues this [c]ourt is called upon to decide.\" S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Cochran,\r\n364 S.C. 621, 626, 614 S.E.2d 642, 645 (2005). \"We exercise great caution in\r\nreviewing termination proceedings and will conclude termination is proper only\r\nwhen the evidence clearly and convincingly mandates such a result.\" Id.\r\n\r\nThe DSS caseworker and the Guardian ad Litem (the GAL) both testified TPR was\r\nin the child's best interest. Although Mother admittedly made progress on her\r\ntreatment plan, she failed to attend mental health counseling for a year. Due to the\r\nnature of her mental condition, her failure to address her mental condition is\r\nsignificant, and the evidence showed the child could face harm in Mother's care.\r\n\r\nWe disagree with Mother's contention that the evidence showed a strong bond\r\nexisted between her and the child. The DSS caseworker observed Mother\r\ninteracting with the child and noted Mother barely interacted with him during the\r\ninitial visitations. The caseworker also stated Mother frequently cancelled\r\nscheduled visitations at the last minute, which was disruptive to the child.\r\n\r\nWe find the child's age is also a significant factor. The child was two years old\r\nwhen he was removed from Mother's home, three years old when the TPR hearing\r\nwas held, and he is currently five years old. Finally, the caseworker testified DSS\r\nhad identified adoptive prospects; thus, the evidence suggests the child is a viable\r\ncandidate for adoption. See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2510 (2010) (\"The purpose of\r\n[the TPR statute] is to establish procedures for the reasonable and compassionate\r\n[TPR] where children are abused, neglected, or abandoned in order to protect the\r\nhealth and welfare of these children and make them eligible for adoption . . . .\").\r\nBased on Mother's limited interactions with the child during the initial visits, which\r\nsuggested a strong bond did not exist between her and the child; the child's success\r\n\nin foster care; the recommendations of the DSS caseworker and the GAL; and\r\nMother's failure to attend mental health counseling to treat her severe mental\r\ncondition, we find TPR is in the child's best interest.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.1\n\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and SHORT and GEATHERS, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1   We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"}]
