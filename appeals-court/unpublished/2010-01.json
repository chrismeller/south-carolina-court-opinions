Â Werner and its carrier, Liberty Mutual Group\r\n  (collectively Appellants), denied the claim.Â  Appellants asserted the South\r\n  Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission (the Commission) lacked jurisdiction\r\n  and Massey was not entitled to benefits.Â  \r\nAfter a hearing, the\r\n  single commissioner awarded Massey temporary total disability benefits and\r\n  causally related medical expenses, finding Massey was Werner's employee, not an\r\n  independent contractor.Â  As an alternative ground, the single commissioner held\r\n  Massey was a statutory employee under section 42-1-400 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code. Â The single commissioner awarded benefits based on an average weekly wage\r\n  of $667.11.Â  Finally, the single commissioner held the Commission had\r\n  jurisdiction because Massey was hired and employed in South Carolina.Â  \r\nAppellants appealed to the Commission's appellate panel, which affirmed\r\n  the single commissioner's findings. Â Both the circuit court and this\r\n  court affirmed.Â  Massey v. Werner Enterprises, Inc., Op. No. 2008-UP-126\r\n  (S.C. Ct. App. filed Feb. 20, 2008).Â  Appellants then filed a petition\r\n  for a writ of certiorari with the supreme court.Â  The supreme court granted\r\n  certiorari and remanded the action to this court for further consideration of\r\n  the independent contractor issue in light of the supreme court's recent opinion\r\n  in Wilkinson v. Palmetto State Transp. Co., 382 S.C. 295, 676 S.E.2d 700\r\n  (2009).[2]Â  Massey v. Werner Enterprises, Inc., Op. No. 2009-MO-034 (S.C. Sup. Ct.\r\n  filed June 29, 2009).Â  The parties filed supplemental briefs with this court\r\n  applying the Wilkinson opinion to the facts of this case.Â  We affirm in\r\n  part and reverse in part.\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; EMPLOYEE OR\r\n  INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR\r\nRelying\r\n  on Wilkinson, Appellants argue Massey is not entitled to South Carolina\r\n  Workers' Compensation benefits because she was an independent contractor for\r\n  workers' compensation purposes.Â  We agree.\r\nAlthough the parties' contract must be considered in\r\n  determining the nature of their relationship, the description of the\r\n  relationship set forth in the contract is not dispositive.Â  Kilgore Group, Inc. v. S.C. Employment\r\n    Sec. Comm'n, 313 S.C. 65,\r\n  68-69, 437 S.E.2d 48, 50 (1993).Â  Rather, the\r\n  test to determine whether an employer-employee relationship exists is if the\r\n  alleged employer has the right and authority to control and direct the\r\n  claimant's work or undertaking as to the manner or means of its\r\n  accomplishment.Â  S.C. Workers' Comp. Comm'n v. Ray Covington Realtors, Inc.,\r\n  318 S.C. 546, 547, 45 S.E.2d 302, 303 (1995).Â  In determining the right of\r\n  control, an appellate court must examine the following four factors: (1) direct\r\n  evidence of the right or exercise of control; (2) furnishing of equipment; (3)\r\n  method of payment; and (4) right to fire.Â  Tharpe v. G.E. Moore Co., 254\r\n  S.C. 196, 200, 174 S.E.2d 397, 399 (1970).Â  In Dawkins v. Jordan, the\r\n  supreme court approved of adding the following framework to the analysis:\r\n\r\n\t[F]or\r\n  the most part, any single factor is not merely indicative of, but, in practice,\r\n  virtually proof of, the employment relation; while, in the opposite direction,\r\n  contrary evidence is as to any one factor at best only mildly persuasive\r\n  evidence of contractorship, and sometimes is of almost no such force at all.\r\n\r\n341 S.C. 434, 439, 534 S.E.2d\r\n  700, 703 (2000) (quoting Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, 3 Larson's\r\n    Workers' Compensation Law Â§ 61.04 (2000)).\r\nIn Wilkinson,\r\n  however, the supreme court overruled the approach set forth in Dawkins,\r\n  stating &quot;[we] overrule Dawkins' analytical framework, for it most\r\n  assuredly skews the analysis to a finding of employment.Â  We return to our\r\n  jurisprudence that evaluates the four factors with equal force in both\r\n  directions.&quot;Â  382 S.C. at\r\n  300, 676 S.E.2d at 702.\r\nHere,\r\n  after considering the parties' contract and evaluating the four factors with\r\n  equal force, we hold Massey was an independent contractor.Â  \r\nMassey\r\n  admits she and her husband entered into a &quot;contract&quot; with Werner to\r\n  lease their truck pursuant to an owner-operator agreement. Moreover, Massey\r\n  concedes she signed an &quot;Owner-Operator Compensation Coverage\r\n  Agreement,&quot; wherein she is referred to as a &quot;Contractor,&quot; and\r\n  she sought workers' compensation coverage under Nebraska law.Â  Further, in a\r\n  &quot;Declaration of Employment Status&quot; document, Massey declared she was\r\n  &quot;self-employed.&quot; Â See Kilgore Group,\r\n  313 S.C. at 68-69, 437 S.E.2d at 50 (holding the description of the parties' relationship as set forth in the\r\n  parties' contract must be considered, but the description is not dispositive in\r\n  determining the nature of their relationship).Â  \r\nAn\r\n  examination of the four factors also weighs in favor of holding Massey was an\r\n  independent contractor.Â  As to the first factor, Massey retained the right to\r\n  refuse any load Werner requested she haul. Â Although Werner required Massey to\r\n  affix Werner logos on the tractor, this requirement is in accordance with\r\n  federal government regulations and should not be considered as evidence of\r\n  control.Â  See Wilkinson, 382 S.C. at 302, 676 S.E.2d at 703.Â  Other evidence, however, shows Werner did maintain some control over\r\n  Massey.Â  Massey could not drive the truck for personal errands or drive for\r\n  another company. Â In addition, Werner required Massey to use pre-approved fuel\r\n  stops and service shops. Â Werner also required Massey to install a global\r\n  positioning satellite (GPS) system in her truck to track the location of the\r\n  truck. Â But see id. (holding the presence of a GPS system was not\r\n  evidence of the motor carrier's control over its drivers when the system was\r\n  for the benefit of customers tracking the shipment of goods). \r\nRegarding\r\n  the second factor, the furnishing of equipment, Massey and her husband owned\r\n  the tractor and leased it to Werner.Â  Massey testified she had the\r\n  option to employ other individuals to drive the tractor, as long as the drivers\r\n  were approved by Werner. Â Although Werner provided Massey a gas card, Massey\r\n  reimbursed Werner for the cost of gas.Â  As set forth above, the presence of\r\n  Werner logos should not be considered as evidence of control.Â  See Wilkinson, 382 S.C. at 302, 676 S.E.2d\r\n  at 703.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  to the third factor, method of payment, Massey's testimony demonstrates Massey\r\n  was paid as an independent contractor.Â  Massey testified in her deposition she\r\n  was paid per mile and Werner deducted &quot;fuel, insurance, tags, just about\r\n  everything it took to operate the truck&quot; from Massey's check.Â  Massey\r\n  further testified she could refuse a load, but Werner &quot;just didn't pay\r\n  [her] for sitting there.&quot; \r\nFinally,\r\n  although there is some evidence to the contrary,[3] Massey's testimony regarding the right to fire speaks for itself: \r\n\r\n\tIt was\r\n  in the lease contract that you had to work so long with them and they couldn't\r\n    even terminate â€“ they had to have a good reason to terminate the lease. . .\r\n  . I was under contract, under a lease that I had signed, that it [sic] would\r\n  stay with them so long.\r\n\r\nAs set forth above, the factors weigh in favor of\r\n  finding Massey was an independent contractor.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the\r\n  circuit court and hold Massey was an independent contractor.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; STATUTORY\r\n  EMPLOYEE\r\nAs\r\n  set forth above, the single\r\n  commissioner awarded Massey benefits holding, as an alternative ground, that Massey\r\n  was a statutory employee under section 42-1-400 of the South Carolina Code.Â  Â We did not address this issue in our prior\r\n  unpublished opinion because we affirmed on the ground that Massey was Werner's direct\r\n  employee.Â  The supreme court likewise did not address this issue.Â  Because we\r\n  are now holding Massey was an independent contractor, we must decide whether\r\n  Massey is nevertheless entitled to benefits as a statutory employee.[4] \r\nThe statutory employment\r\n  concept is based on section 42-1-400 of the South Carolina Code.Â  The section\r\n  provides as follows:\r\n\r\n\tWhen\r\n  any person, in this section and Â§Â§ 42-1-420 and 42-1-430 referred to as\r\n  &quot;owner,&quot; undertakes to perform or execute any work which is a \r\n\tpart of his trade, business or occupation and contracts with any other person (in this section and Â§Â§ 42-1-420 to\r\n  42-1-450 referred to as &quot;subcontractor&quot;) for the execution or\r\n  performance by or under such subcontractor of\r\n  the whole or any part of the work undertaken by such owner, the owner shall be\r\n  liable to pay to any workman employed in the work any compensation under this\r\n  Title which he would have been liable to pay if the workman had been\r\n  immediately employed by him.\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-400 (Supp. 2008).Â  An activity is &quot;part of [the owner's]\r\n  trade, business, or occupation&quot; for purposes of the statute if it (1) is\r\n  an important part of the owner's business or trade; (2) is a necessary,\r\n  essential, and integral part of the owner's business; or (3) has previously been performed\r\n  by the owner's employees. Â Olmstead v. Shakespeare, 354 S.C. 421, 424,\r\n  581 S.E.2d 483, 485 (2003).Â  &quot;If the activity at issue meets even one of\r\n  these three criteria, the injured employee qualifies as the statutory employee of\r\n  'the owner.'&quot; Â Id.\r\nHere,\r\n  Massey, a truck driver, sustained injuries while transporting loads for Werner,\r\n  a common carrier.Â  Clearly, the transportation of goods is an important,\r\n  integral part of Werner's trade, business, or occupation.\r\nFurther, Massey's status as an independent contractor\r\n  does not preclude her from receiving benefits as a statutory employee. Â See Smith v. T.H. Snipes &amp; Sons, Inc., 306 S.C. 289, 411 S.E.2d 439\r\n  (1991).Â  In Smith, Smith's decedent, a self-employed welder, was fatally\r\n  injured while repairing a metal shearing machine in T.H. Snipes' place of\r\n  business.Â  Id. at 290, 411 S.E.2d at 439.Â  Our supreme court found the\r\n  decedent was T.H. Snipes' statutory employee even though the decedent was\r\n  &quot;self employed&quot; and a &quot;subcontractor.&quot;Â  Id. at\r\n  290-91, 411 S.E.2d 439-40. Â The court stated &quot;nothing in the language of\r\n  [Â§ 42-1-400] precludes classification of a subcontractor as a statutory\r\n  employee.&quot;Â  Id. at 291, 411 S.E.2d at 440.Â  We see no distinction between Smith and this case, except that the decedent in Smith was a welder and\r\n  Massey was a truck driver.\r\nWe therefore affirm the circuit court's holding that\r\n  Massey is entitled to benefits as a statutory employee.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.[5]\r\nPIEPER, J., and CURETON and GOOLSBY, A.JJ., concur.\r\nAMENDMENT[6]\r\nAppellants\r\n  filed a petition for rehearing, arguing this court erred in holding Massey is\r\n  entitled to benefits as a statutory employee. Â Specifically, Appellants argue\r\n  Massey cannot be a statutory employee because she did not elect to receive\r\n  benefits as required by section 42-1-130 of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n  2009).Â  Massey filed a return to Appellants' petition, arguing this court erred\r\n  in even addressing the issue because it was not preserved for our review.Â Â Â  \r\nAlthough Appellants argued Massey was not a statutory employee\r\n  because she &quot;was not a workman employed by a subcontractor as contemplated\r\n  by [section] 42-1-400,&quot; Appellants never argued Massey was not a statutory\r\n  employee because she failed to elect to receive benefits under section\r\n  42-1-130.Â  Furthermore, the circuit court did not\r\n  rule on this particular issue.Â  In fact, in its analysis, the circuit court did\r\n  not even mention the statutory employee issue, but it did &quot;affirm the\r\n  Order of the Commission as to all issues.&quot;[7]Â \r\n  We further note that Appellants did not file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to\r\n  alter or amend the judgment asking the circuit court to address the issue.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold this issue is not properly before us, and the Appellate Panel's holding\r\n  is the law of the case.Â  See Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58,\r\n  403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (holding the court of appeals should not address an\r\n  issue that was not explicitly ruled on below); ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P.\r\n    v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 327 S.C. 238, 241, 489 S.E.2d 470, 472 (1997)\r\n  (stating an unappealed ruling is the law of the case and should not be reconsidered by the appellate court).[8]\r\nOur\r\n  conclusion remains the same.Â  The order of the circuit court is reversed in\r\n  part and affirmed in part.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Prior to filing this action, Massey received benefits\r\n  under Nebraska law.\r\n[2] With facts similar to the\r\n  case at hand, Wilkinson involved the issue of whether the claimant, a\r\n  long-haul trucker, was an employee of or an independent contractor for Palmetto,\r\n  an interstate motor carrier.Â  In that case, the supreme court reversed\r\n  this court and held the claimant was an independent contractor.Â  Id.\r\n[3]Â  Massey testified she could not drive a load for\r\n  another company &quot;and then come back to work.&quot;Â Â  In addition, Massey\r\n  testified Werner would terminate the lease if she took more than four\r\n  consecutive days off.Â  \r\n[4] Appellants summarily addressed this issue in their\r\n  initial brief and supplemental brief.Â  We address this issue giving Appellants\r\n  the benefit of the doubt regarding whether this issue is properly before us.Â  See Bryson v. Bryson, 378 S.C. 502, 510, 662 S.E.2d 611, 615 (Ct. App. 2008)\r\n  (&quot;An issue is deemed abandoned and will not be considered on appeal if the\r\n  argument is raised in a brief but not supported by authority.&quot;); Glasscock,\r\n    Inc. v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d 689, 691\r\n  (Ct. App. 2001) (&quot;[S]hort, conclusory statements made without supporting\r\n  authority are deemed abandoned on appeal and therefore not presented for\r\n  review.&quot;).\r\n[5] In their initial brief, Appellants also raised the\r\n  following arguments: (1) Massey is not entitled to\r\n  benefits in South Carolina because she elected and received coverage under\r\n  Nebraska law; (2) the commission lacked jurisdiction over Massey's claim for\r\n  benefits; and (3) the\r\n  commission erred in determining Massey's weekly wage and compensation rate.Â \r\n  Because these issues were not affected by the Wilkinson opinion or addressed\r\n  in the supplemental briefs, we adopt our analysis from our prior unpublished opinion. See Massey, Op. No. 2008-UP-126.\r\n[6] Per our order denying Appellants' petition for\r\n  rehearing, we strike though the statutory employee section set forth above and\r\n  substitute the following in its place.\r\n[7] We note the single\r\n  commissioner never ruled on whether Massey was entitled to benefits despite her\r\n  failure to elect benefits.Â  \r\n[8] We further note Appellants summarily addressed this\r\n  issue in their initial brief, simply stating Massey was &quot;not entitled to\r\n  Workers' Compensation benefits under the South Carolina Workers' Compensation\r\n  Act as a direct employee or as a statutory employee under [section]\r\n  42-1-400.&quot;Â  See Bryson v. Bryson, 378 S.C. 502, 510, 662\r\n  S.E.2d 611, 615 (Ct. App. 2008) (&quot;An issue is deemed abandoned and will\r\n  not be considered on appeal if the argument is raised in a brief but not\r\n  supported by authority.&quot;); Glasscock, Inc. v.

App. 2001) (&quot;[S]hort,\r\n  conclusory statements made without supporting authority are deemed abandoned on\r\n  appeal and therefore not presented for review.&quot;).Â  Furthermore, Appellants\r\n  made no mention of the issue in their statement of issues on appeal.Â  See Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (&quot;Ordinarily, no point will be considered which\r\n  is not set forth in the statement of issues on appeal.&quot;)\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-002","title":"Ingomar Limited Partnership v.

[T]hey got a class out at Behavioral Health that AnMed gave me a referral\r\n    to.Â  Itâ€™s a chemical dependence program . . . .Â  I think itâ€™s a ninety-day\r\n    program . . . .\r\n  .Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  .Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  .\r\n  [Probation Agent]:Â \r\n    Your Honor, if he canâ€™t do the A.T.U., the State still stands at a partial\r\n    revocation of two years.\r\n  [Court]:Â  All right.Â \r\n    Iâ€™m going to take this under advisement for about half a day.Â  I need to make a\r\n    call on this one.Â  I need to find out something about it.Â  So Iâ€™ll let you know\r\n    this afternoon.\r\n  [Hollandâ€™s Counsel]:Â \r\n    Okay.Â  Does his honor want to see the referral?\r\n  [Court]: Â No.Â  I\r\n    believe you.Â  I mean the question really is where do I send you.Â  I mean,\r\n    thatâ€™s the problem.Â  So give me about half a day.Â  Iâ€™ll let you know this\r\n    afternoon one way or the other.Â  Okay?\r\n  Holland\r\n    then thanked the court and the matter concluded.\r\n\r\nOn September 14, 2007, the\r\n  trial court signed an order revoking three years of Hollandâ€™s suspended\r\n  sentence.Â  The order indicates Holland was presented with the order but refused\r\n  to sign it on September 19, 2007.Â  On September 21, 2007, counsel for Holland prepared\r\n  a notice of appeal in this matter, and included a footnote stating the hearing\r\n  was held on September 10 and the court took the matter under advisement, but\r\n  the court never advised counsel of the sentence and only after counsel\r\n  contacted the parole office on September 20 was he informed of the sentence.\r\nISSUE\r\nâ€œWhether Holland is entitled\r\n  to have his probation revocation sentence vacated and allowed to have a\r\n  resentencing hearing because the judge sentenced him in his absence, after\r\n  making additional phone calls to unknown parties about his case, and neither\r\n  Holland nor his attorney were ever made aware of the contents of those\r\n  conversations or allowed to object to the sentence that was imposed.â€\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHolland contends, instead of\r\n  honoring the probation departmentâ€™s request for a two year partial revocation,\r\n  the judge ordered Holland be committed for a three year term with termination\r\n  of probation, and did so without informing either him or his attorney.Â  He\r\n  argues the trial judgeâ€™s actions violated his due process rights inasmuch as he\r\n  had the right to be present at his sentencing, and by sentencing him in his\r\n  absence, the judge denied him his right to object to the sentence on the record\r\n  and foreclosed his ability to raise an abuse of discretion argument with\r\n  respect to the sentence.Â  Holland maintains he was not given the opportunity to\r\n  ask the court to reconsider its judgment in light of the facts uncovered by the\r\n  judge in his phone calls as he was not privy to the conversations nor present\r\n  when the judge sentenced him.\r\nHolland has failed to\r\n  preserve this issue for appellate review.Â  For an issue to be properly\r\n  preserved for review, it must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court,\r\n  and issues not so raised and ruled upon will not be considered on appeal.Â  State\r\n    v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693-94 (2003).Â  An issue may\r\n  not be raised for the first time on appeal.Â  In re Michael H., 360 S.C.\r\n  540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729, 732 (2004).Â  In order to preserve an issue for\r\n  appeal, it must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court; the trial court\r\n  must be given an opportunity to resolve the issue before it is presented to the\r\n  appellate court.Â  Id.Â  Here, when the trial court stated its intention\r\n  to take the matter under advisement and make a phone call, counsel responded,\r\n  â€œOkay.â€Â  The judge then made clear the question he had was where he should send\r\n  Holland and that he needed more time to resolve that problem.Â  Holland did not\r\n  object to or raise any issue with regard to this proposal by the court.Â \r\n  Neither did Holland request he have an opportunity to be heard on the matter\r\n  after the court made any such phone calls, or before the courtâ€™s final\r\n  determination regarding revocation.Â  Additionally, Holland could have made a\r\n  post trial motion for reconsideration of the three year revocation, or a motion\r\n  for a new probation sentencing hearing based on his right to appear and object\r\n  to the sentence.Â  See Rule 29, SCRCrimP (â€œExcept for motions for new\r\n  trials based on after-discovered evidence, post trial motions shall be made\r\n  within ten (10) days after the imposition of the sentence.â€).Â  Because Holland\r\n  implicitly acquiesced in the judge taking the matter under advisement in order\r\n  for him to determine where he would send Holland, raised no objection to this\r\n  proposal nor requested he be heard again on the matter after the judge had\r\n  looked into the matter, and made no post-trial motion raising the issue he now\r\n  raises on appeal, the trial court was never given an opportunity to address the\r\n  issue.Â  The decision of the trial court is accordingly\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, A.C.J.,\r\n  GEATHERS, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-025","title":"The State v.

King, 384 S.C. 134, 142, 681 S.E.2d 609, 614 (Ct. App. 2009) (requiring\r\n  an issue be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court in order to be\r\n  preserved for appellate review); see also In re Timmerman, 331\r\n  S.C. 455, 460, 502 S.E.2d 920, 922 (Ct. App. 1998) (&quot;When a party receives\r\n  an order that grants certain relief not previously contemplated or presented to\r\n  the trial court, the aggrieved party must move, pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP,\r\n  to alter or amend the judgment in order to preserve the issue for\r\n  appeal.&quot;).\r\n2.Â  We find the family\r\n  court's classification of Wife's BMW as non-marital property incorrect because\r\n  it was personal property acquired during the marriage.Â  See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann Â§ 20-3-630(A) (Supp. 2008) (defining &quot;marital property&quot; as real\r\n  and personal property acquired by the parties during the marriage).Â  However, we\r\n  find the family court did not err by using its discretion to award Wife the\r\n  BMW.Â  See Simpson v. Simpson, 377 S.C. 527, 533, 660 S.E.2d 278,\r\n  282 (2008) (&quot;The division of marital property is within the sound\r\n  discretion of the family court, and on appeal, it will not be disturbed absent\r\n  an abuse of discretion.&quot;); Nasser-Moghaddassi v. Moghaddassi, 364\r\n  S.C. 182, 197, 612 S.E.2d 707, 715 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Morris v. Morris,\r\n  335 S.C. 525, 531, 517 S.E.2d 720, 723 (Ct. App. 1999)) (&quot;Upon dissolution\r\n  of the marriage, marital property should be divided and distributed in a manner\r\n  which fairly reflects each spouse's contribution to its acquisition, regardless\r\n  of who holds legal title.&quot;).Â  \r\n3.Â  We affirm the family\r\n  court's decision to award attorney's fees.Â  Doe v. Doe, 319 S.C. 151, 157,\r\n  459 S.E.2d 892, 896 (Ct. App. 1995) (stating an award of attorneyâ€™s fees rests\r\n  within the sound discretion of the trial court and should not be disturbed on\r\n  appeal absent an abuse of discretion).Â  A family court should first consider the following factors as set forth in E.D.M. v. T.A.M., in\r\n  deciding whether to award attorney's fees and costs:Â  (1) each party's\r\n  ability to pay his or her own fee; (2) the beneficial results obtained by the\r\n  attorney; (3) the parties' respective financial conditions; and (4) the effect\r\n  of the fee on each party's standard of living.Â  307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415\r\n  S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992); see also Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C.\r\n  158, 161 n.1, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 n.1 (1991).Â  We find the family court\r\n  properly considered the factors set forth in E.D.M. Â After deciding to award\r\n  attorney's fees, a family court should then consider the following factors as set\r\n  forth in Glasscock in deciding how much to award in attorney's\r\n  fees and costs:Â  (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the\r\n  time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) professional standing of counsel; (4)\r\n  contingency of compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained; and (6) customary\r\n  legal fees for similar services.Â  304 S.C. at 161, 403 S.E.2d at 315; see\r\n    also Feldman v. Feldman, 380 S.C. 538, 546-47, 670 S.E.2d 669, 673 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2008).Â  Although the family court did not delineate its\r\n  consideration of these six factors, we find by our own preponderance of the\r\n  evidence that the amount of attorney's fees awarded is reasonable under Glasscock.Â  See Henggeler v. Hanson, 333 S.C. 598, 601-02,\r\n  510 S.E.2d 722, 724 (Ct. App. 1998) (&quot;On appeal from the family\r\n  court, this court has jurisdiction to correct errors of law and find facts in\r\n  accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.&quot;).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS, PIEPER, and\r\n  LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-029","title":"The State v.
