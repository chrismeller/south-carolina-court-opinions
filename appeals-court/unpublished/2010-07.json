Markley Dennis, Jr., Circuit Court\r\nJudge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2010-UP-350\r\n  Submitted June 1, 2010 â€“ Filed July 7,\r\n2010Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Dennis James Christensen, of Mt. Pleasant, for Appellant.\r\n        Nat B. Benson, Jr, of Mt. Pleasant, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Pauline Jane O'Keefe (Daughter) appeals\r\n  the circuit court's order affirming the probate courtâ€™s orders appointing third\r\n  parties as Pauline Muckenfuss's (Mother's) guardian and conservator.Â  Daughter\r\n  argues the probate court erred in finding good cause existed to bypass her\r\n  statutorily-designated priority as Mother's attorney-in-fact.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nMother is a widow\r\n  who has four children, Daughter, and three sons: Thomas (Tommy), Wendell, and\r\n  Paul Muckenfuss (Sons).Â  Daughter was designated as Mother's attorney-in-fact in\r\n  October of 2002.Â  Mother was admitted to the Savannah House, an assisted-living\r\n  facility in Charleston, in November of 2002, following hospitalization for\r\n  mental illness.\r\nOn January 29,\r\n  2004, Wendell and Tommy petitioned the probate court to find Mother incapacitated\r\n  and to appoint a guardian and conservator.Â  After a hearing, the probate court\r\n  ordered third parties Seniors Choice and First Southeast Fiduciary and Trust\r\n  Services, Incorporated, to serve as Mother's guardian and conservator,\r\n  respectively.Â  Daughter appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed.Â \r\n  Daughter then appealed to this court.Â  \r\nIn an unpublished\r\n  opinion, this court held: Â &quot;Based\r\n  on the language of the applicable statutes, we believe before a probate court\r\n  bypasses a person with a statutory priority for the appointment of a\r\n  conservator or guardian, it must make a finding of good cause by articulating\r\n  its reasons for such a finding.&quot; Â Muckenfuss v. Muckenfuss, Op. No.\r\n  07-UP-361 (Ct. App. filed July 7, 2007).Â  Because the probate court failed to\r\n  make the requisite finding of good cause, we remanded the case to the probate\r\n  court for a finding consistent with the statutes.Â  Id.Â  \r\nOn remand, the\r\n  probate court found good cause existed to appoint third parties as Mother's\r\n  guardian and conservator due to the friction and divisiveness between Daughter\r\n  and Sons, as well as Daughter's lack of communication with Sons.Â  The circuit\r\n  court affirmed.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;[T]he determination of\r\n  the standard of review by an appellate court of matters originating in the\r\n  probate court is controlled by whether the cause of action is at law or in\r\n  equity.&quot; Â Dean v. Kilgore, 313 S.C. 257, 259, 437 S.E.2d 154, 155\r\n  (Ct. App. 1993).Â  &quot;To make this determination, the appellate court must\r\n  look to the essential character of the cause of action alleged by the\r\n  petitioners in the court below.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;Persons of unsound\r\n  mind, like infants, are under the special protection of the courts of equity\r\n  with respect to their persons, property, and legal transactions.&quot;Â  Shepard\r\n    v. First Am. Mortgage Co., 289 S.C. 516, 518, 347 S.E.2d 118, 119 (Ct. App.\r\n  1986); Gaddy v. Douglass, 359 S.C. 329, 333, 597 S.E.2d 12, 14 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004) (recognizing an action to set aside\r\n  a power of attorney and an instrument revoking a power of attorney on the\r\n  ground of a lack of mental capacity sounds in equity); see Dean, 313 S.C. at 259, 437 S.E.2d\r\n  at 155 (finding petition to remove personal representative is in equity). Â When the\r\n  circuit court concurs with the probate court in an equity case, the standard of\r\n  review for this court is whether there is any evidence that reasonably supports\r\n  the findings of the court below.Â  Dean, 313 at 260, 437 S.E.2d at\r\n  155-56.\r\nThe specific choice of who\r\n  should serve as guardian and conservator is decided under the probate court's\r\n  discretion.Â  &quot;The matter of a selection of a guardian is within the\r\n  discretion of the court, and the appellate court ordinarily will not interfere\r\n  unless a clear abuse of discretion is shown.&quot;Â  39 C.J.S. Guardian and\r\n    Ward Â§ 28 (2003).Â  &quot;The selection of a\r\n  guardian is a matter committed largely to the discretion of the appointing\r\n  court, whose decision will only be interfered with on appeal in the case of an\r\n  abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  39 Am. Jur. 2d Guardian and Ward Â§ 38 (2008).Â  \r\nThe relevant statutes in this\r\n  case, Sections 62-5-311 and 62-5-410 of the South Carolina Code (2009),\r\n  indicate the appointing court has discretion by using the phrases &quot;may be\r\n  appointed guardian&quot; and &quot;the court may appoint . . . as\r\n  conservator,&quot; respectively.Â  The appointing court will not be overturned absent an\r\n  abuse of discretion.

Cook, 288\r\n  S.C. 220, 221, 341 S.E.2d 782, 782 (1986) (interpreting an appointment statute\r\n  without priority guidelines).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDaughter argues the probate\r\n  court, and in turn the circuit court, erred in finding good cause to appoint\r\n  third parties as Mother's guardian and conservator because Daughter had\r\n  statutory priority as Mother's attorney-in-fact.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nSection 62-5-311 states the\r\n  order of priority for guardian appointees but provides such priority is\r\n  &quot;subject to a finding of good cause by the court.&quot;Â  Similarly, section\r\n  62-5-410 sets forth the order of priority for conservator appointees but\r\n  allows: Â &quot;The court, for good cause, may pass\r\n  over a person having priority and appoint a person having less priority or no\r\n  priority.&quot;Â  Under both statutes, Daughter, as Mother's attorney-in-fact,\r\n  has priority over the third parties appointed by the probate court.Â  Â§Â§\r\n  62-5-311(B)(2) &amp; 62-4-410(a)(3).Â  \r\nGood cause is\r\n  defined as &quot;[a] legally sufficient reason.Â  Good cause is often the burden\r\n  placed on the litigant . . . to show why a request should be granted or an\r\n  action excused.&quot;Â  Black's Law Dictionary 251 (9th ed. 2009).Â  &quot;Bitter\r\n  dissension between an incapacitated person's family members . . . can justify\r\n  appointment of a neutral third party as a guardian.&quot;Â  39 Am. Jur. 2d Guardian\r\n    &amp; Ward Â§ 41 (2008).Â  \r\nAt trial, Dr.\r\n  Susan Hardesty of the Medical University of South Carolina testified Mother\r\n  needed a guardian and conservator.Â  Dr. Hardesty stated to a reasonable degree\r\n  of medical certainty Mother's capacity did not allow her to manage her\r\n  resources.Â  \r\nDr. Hardesty\r\n  testified Mother was paranoid regarding her children's roles in assisting her\r\n  with her affairs.Â  In addition, she stated the object of Mother's paranoia\r\n  seemed to shift from the Sons to Daughter.Â  Dr. Hardesty testified having one\r\n  of Mother's children serve as a guardian or conservator \r\n\r\n  would aggravate [Motherâ€™s] condition in the sense that her\r\n    condition is going to proceed as it will independent of those kind of external\r\n    forces.Â  I think she might be more or less angry, depending on where her\r\n    paranoid ideation was at the time if someone interacted -- if one of her\r\n    children made a decision.Â  But that's going to be dependent on what the\r\n    paranoia is doing at the time.Â  \r\n\r\nThe guardian ad\r\n  litem recommended having third parties appointed as guardian and conservator\r\n  for Mother.Â  The guardian believed a third party serving as guardian and\r\n  conservator would be in the best interest of everyone given the infighting\r\n  between Daughter and Sons.Â  The guardian believed a third party could\r\n  circumvent current communication problems, but the animosity between Daughter\r\n  and Sons will likely remain regardless of whether a third party is used.Â  \r\nThe guardian\r\n  testified: \r\n\r\n  [Mother] did seem to note and she pointed out very clearly the\r\n    friction that is between her children, and she felt like it would be in the\r\n    best interest of everybody if there was a third person appointed to take care\r\n    of her everyday affairs, throughout the financial matters, because she felt like\r\n    that may reduce the friction.Â  \r\n\r\nThe guardian\r\n  testified Mother fully understood what the roles of the guardian and\r\n  conservator would be.Â  \r\nDr. Hardesty\r\n  first testified any suggestions by Mother regarding who should serve as her\r\n  guardian and conservator should be given limited weight, if any.Â  However, when\r\n  questioned by the guardian whether he should put any weight on Mother's recommendation\r\n  to him that a third party should be appointed, she stated:Â  \r\n\r\n  I certainly would put weight on her opinion that she has the\r\n    desire to have a third party to intervene and give it some weight, yes.Â  I\r\n    wouldn't say it would be the overall decision-maker, but, certainly, she's\r\n    indicated it to you and she's indicated it to me in a different way.Â  \r\n\r\nMother had, in\r\n  fact, requested Dr. Hardesty intervene in her affairs. Â \r\nPaul, Wendell,\r\n  and Daughter all testified about the friction between the siblings.Â  Paul\r\n  stated he believed having a third party involved in Mother's care would be best\r\n  for everyone. Â Wendell also requested a third party's involvement in order to\r\n  reduce the infighting in the family and minimize Mother's paranoia towards her\r\n  children.Â  Regarding the friction, Wendell testified Daughter would not allow\r\n  him to visit Mother privately on one occasion.Â  Wendell further testified\r\n  Daughter's husband followed him to the airport and behaved suspiciously.Â \r\n  Daughter acknowledged she has difficulty with Wendell, but maintained she gets\r\n  along well with Tommy and Paul.Â  \r\nIn response to\r\n  Wendell's statement that Daughter refused to allow him to see Mother, Daughter\r\n  stated she suggested Wendell not meet with Mother alone because Mother had not\r\n  seen Wendell in years and it would be too shocking for Mother.Â  According to\r\n  Daughter, while Wendell was speaking to Mother that day, a Savannah House\r\n  employee informed Daughter that Mother's whole body was shaking.Â  \r\nThe guardian, Dr.\r\n  Hardesty, Paul, and a Savannah House employee all testified Daughter has taken\r\n  good care of Mother.Â  However, the statutes do not require a finding of wrong-doing\r\n  by the person with priority.Â  They simply require good cause to by-pass the\r\n  person with priority.Â  The record also contains evidence Daughter failed to\r\n  communicate with her brothers concerning Mother's care.Â  Paul testified he had\r\n  to call the police to discover the location of Mother when Daughter moved her\r\n  to Savannah House because Daughter failed to notify him of the move.Â  Daughter\r\n  explained she had told Tommy about the move and assumed he would tell their\r\n  other brothers.Â  In addition, Daughter acknowledged that because she does not\r\n  get along with Wendell, she has only called him twice during the years she has\r\n  held Mother's power of attorney.Â  Daughter testified she did not tell her brothers she had the power\r\n  of attorney because Mother requested she not tell them.Â  \r\nThe probate court\r\n  found Daughter made an unsatisfactory showing that she could fulfill the duties\r\n  of a guardian and conservator, which include communicating with family members\r\n  regarding any type of placement and any major medical issues.Â  We hold the\r\n  record contains evidence to support this finding and the probate court's ruling\r\n  that good cause exists to by-pass Daughter's priority in the appointment of\r\n  Mother's guardian and conservator.Â  Therefore, under our standard of review, we\r\n  must affirm the probate court.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, SHORT,\r\n  and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-351","title":"Musick v.

Dicks and\r\n  Robert E. Dicks, Jr. (Appellants) argue that the court erred in granting\r\n  Musick's motion, in denying their motion, and in finding that Appellants\r\n  violated the restrictive covenants of the subdivision by further subdividing a\r\n  2.67 acre parcel.Â  We reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand for a\r\n  trial on the merits.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellants purchased a piece of property, known as Blocks 28 and\r\n  29, situated in Long Bay Estates off of Highway 17 in Horry County.Â  The 1955 Plat of Long Bay Estates contains the\r\n  following restriction:\r\n\r\n  (a) No lot shall be subdivided and no building, including\r\n    porches or projections of any kind, shall be erected at a distance less than 40 feet from the front line of Blocks One (1) through Five (5) and not less than 20 feet from the front line on Blocks Six (6) through Twenty-Seven (27), ten feet\r\n    from any side line and 20 feet from the rear.\r\n  As to all unsold lots, the Grantors reserve the right\r\n    to change the boundary lines and the building lines thereof.\r\n\r\n1955 Plat (emphasis\r\n  in original).Â  This restriction is also contained in a document recorded at the\r\n  Register of Mesne Conveyances for Horry County in 1958 (the 1958 Restrictions).Â \r\n  Both documents provided:Â  &quot;These Protective Covenants are recorded as\r\n  Blanket Covenants covering all lots in Blocks 1-27, as shown on the Plat of\r\n  Long Bay Estates dated May, 1955, compiled by Robt. L. Bellamy, Engineer.&quot;Â  \r\nIn\r\n  1972, the Master-In-Equity issued a report, adopted as an order of the circuit\r\n  court (the 1972 Order), regarding the rights of property owners in Long Bay\r\n  Estates and the effect of the 1958 Restrictions on the property.Â  The order\r\n  provided Blocks 30, 32, and 34 were &quot;subject to the restrictions of the\r\n  same type and character as those . . . applicable to Blocks 1-27, inclusive.&quot;Â \r\n  The order further stated:\r\n\r\n  In like\r\n    manner the remaining portions of &quot;old&quot; Blocks 28 and 29, that is to\r\n    say the area lying between the rear of Blocks 24 and 25 and the\r\n    southeasternmost &quot;paved street&quot; are subject to such residential\r\n    restrictions, but with right of revision of the lot arrangement or for\r\n    combination with abutting portions of lots in Blocks 24 and 25.Â  The\r\n    restrictions uniformly used in this area and the declaration . . . reserved to\r\n    grantor the right to change boundary lines and building lines as to any unsold\r\n    lots in any event.\r\n\r\nIn\r\n  2000, some property owners in Long Bay Estates were involved in litigation\r\n  again regarding the restrictive covenants, resulting in another order\r\n  interpreting the 1958 Restrictions (the DeCiero Order).Â  \r\nCarmen Ward conveyed the property as one lot to David W. Meese,\r\n  Jr. and Leigh Ammons Meese in 1997.Â  The Meeses conveyed Blocks 28 and 29 to\r\n  Appellants in 2003.Â  \r\nMusick,\r\n  as the owner of Lot 4 of Block 24, alleged in his complaint that he is entitled\r\n  to a declaration that Appellants' attempts to subdivide Blocks 28 and 29 into\r\n  seven individual lots violates the restrictive covenants applicable to all lots\r\n  in Long Bay Estates.Â  Appellants denied the allegations and counterclaimed,\r\n  seeking a declaratory judgment finding that the alleged restrictions do not\r\n  encumber Blocks 28 and 29.Â  \r\nAppellants\r\n  and Musick each filed motions for summary judgment after this matter had been\r\n  referred to the Master-In-Equity.Â  Following a hearing, the court issued a\r\n  &quot;Final Order Ending Action&quot; granting Musick's motion for summary\r\n  judgment.Â  Appellants filed a motion to reconsider.Â  The court heard the\r\n  parties' arguments on Appellants' motion to reconsider before issuing an order\r\n  denying the motion.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAppellants\r\n  argue the trial court failed to apply the correct standard in granting the\r\n  motion for summary judgment.Â  Musick contends that as the parties filed\r\n  cross-motions for summary judgment, the hearing before the trial court was\r\n  essentially converted into a bench trial.Â  We disagree with this contention.Â  \r\nWhen\r\n  each party files a motion for summary judgment and the trial court grants one\r\n  motion while denying the other, this court only reviews the grant of the motion\r\n  for summary judgment, not the denial.Â  Fuller v. Blanchard, 358 S.C.\r\n  536, 546 n.21, 595 S.E.2d 831, 836 n.21 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  In Fuller, the\r\n  case concerned cross-motions for summary judgment regarding two of Dr.\r\n  Blanchard's defenses.Â  Id.Â  The trial court simultaneously granted Mrs.\r\n  Fuller's motion for summary judgment and denied Dr. Blanchard's motion. Â Id.Â \r\n  This court noted the parties had blurred the distinction between the two\r\n  motions. Â Id.Â  We stated:\r\n\r\n  Because\r\n    the granting of a motion for summary judgment is appealable while the denial of\r\n    a motion for summary judgment is not, we are addressing Dr. Blanchard's\r\n    arguments to the extent he appears to challenge the circuit court's grant of\r\n    summary judgment to Mrs. Fuller as an error of law based on the facts of the\r\n    case, although, as stated, there has been an overlapping of these issues due to\r\n    the procedural posture of the case. To the extent Dr. Blanchard appears to\r\n    argue the court should have granted his motion for summary judgment, the denial\r\n    of summary judgment is not properly before us and we do not address it.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nThus,\r\n  we will review the grant of the motion for summary judgment applying the same\r\n  standard that governs the trial court.Â  Wogan v. Kunze, 379 S.C. 581,\r\n  585, 666 S.E.2d 901, 903 (2008).Â  Summary judgment is proper where no genuine\r\n  issue exists as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to\r\n  judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  In determining whether any\r\n  triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences that\r\n  can be drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to\r\n  the non-moving party.Â  Law v. S.C. Dep't of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 434,\r\n  629 S.E.2d 642, 648 (2006).Â  Even when there is no dispute as to the\r\n  evidentiary facts, summary judgment should be denied when there is a dispute as\r\n  to the conclusions or inferences that can be drawn therefrom.Â  Wilson v.\r\n    Style Crest Prods., Inc., 367 S.C. 653, 656, 627 S.E.2d 733, 735 (2006).Â  &quot;[I]n\r\n  cases applying the preponderance of the evidence burden of proof, the\r\n  non-moving party is only required to submit a mere scintilla of evidence in\r\n  order to withstand a motion for summary judgment.&quot;Â  Hancock v.\r\n    Mid-South Mgmt. Co., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803 (2009).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Appellants\r\n  argue the court erred in granting summary judgment by holding the 1958\r\n  Restrictions encumber Blocks 28 and 29.Â  We agree.\r\nThe trial\r\n  court found that the 1972 Order acknowledged that the prohibition against\r\n  subdivision only applied to Blocks 1-27, but the parties to the 1972 litigation\r\n  &quot;specifically agreed that the restrictions would be extended&quot; to\r\n  cover other blocks in the subdivision, including Blocks 28 and 29.Â  In his\r\n  final brief to this court, Musick agrees that &quot;it is undisputed that the\r\n  original language of the covenants stated they applied only to Blocks 1 through\r\n  27.&quot;Â  \r\nRestrictive\r\n  covenants are contractual in nature.Â  RV Resort &amp; Yacht Club Owners\r\n    Ass'n, Inc. v. BillyBob's Marina, Inc., 386 S.C. 313, 320, 688S.E.2d 555,\r\n  559 (2010).Â  The words of restrictive covenants will be given their common,\r\n  ordinary meaning attributed to them at the time of their execution.Â  Taylor\r\n    v. Lindsey, 332 S.C. 1, 4, 498 S.E.2d 862, 863 (1998).Â  &quot;A restriction\r\n  on the use of property must be created in express terms or by plain and\r\n  unmistakable implication . . . .&quot;Â  Buffington v. T.O.E. Enters.,\r\n  383 S.C. 388, 392, 680 S.E.2d 289, 291 (2009) (quoting Hardy v. Aiken,\r\n  369 S.C. 160, 166, 631 S.E.2d 539, 542 (2006)).Â  &quot;[A]ll such restrictions\r\n  are to be strictly construed, with all doubts resolved in favor of the free use\r\n  of property.&quot;Â  Id.Â  In determining whether to enforce a restrictive\r\n  covenant and enjoin a landowner from using their land in a manner that violates\r\n  the covenant, courts should consider equitable doctrines.Â  Id. at 393,\r\n  680 S.E.2d at 291.Â  &quot;The paramount rule of construction is to ascertain\r\n  and give effect to the intent of the parties as determined from the whole\r\n  document.&quot;Â  RV Resort, 386 S.C. at 321, 688 S.E.2d at 559 (quoting Taylor,\r\n  332 S.C. at 4, 498 S.E.2d at 863-64).Â  \r\nWe find\r\n  the 1958 Restrictions, by their express terms, do not apply to Blocks 28 and\r\n  29.Â  Musick argues, and the trial court agreed, that the 1972 Order enlarged\r\n  the 1958 Restrictions such that the restrictions are applicable to all lots in\r\n  Long Bay Estates.Â  Appellants argue the court should have construed the\r\n  language in the 1972 Order in their favor when deciding this matter on Musick's\r\n  motion for summary judgment.Â  We hereby reverse the grant of summary judgment\r\n  as to this issue and remand for a trial on the merits because there is a\r\n  dispute as to the conclusions or inferences that may be drawn from the\r\n  application of the 1972 Order to clarify the 1958 Restrictions.Â  See USAA\r\n    Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Clegg, 377 S.C. 643, 653, 661 S.E.2d 791, 796 (2008); Wilson, 367 S.C. at 656, 627 S.E.2d at 735.Â  \r\n2.Â  Appellants\r\n  argue the court erred in granting summary judgment by finding the DeCiero Order\r\n  operates to extend the prohibition against subdividing to include Blocks 28 and\r\n  29.Â  We agree.\r\nThe trial court misquoted the DeCiero Order in its\r\n  order denying the motion to reconsider as follows:Â  &quot;[o]n their face, it\r\n  is clear the 1958 Restrictive Covenants apply to the entire Long Bay Estates\r\n  subdivision.&quot;Â  Rather, the DeCiero order states:Â  &quot;Thus it is clear\r\n  the Restrictive Covenants apply to all of Blocks 1-27 of Long Bay Estates\r\n  subdivision, including Block 11, Lots 1 and 2.&quot;Â  Therefore, we find it was\r\n  error for the trial court to rely upon the DeCiero Order in its grant of\r\n  summary judgment to find that the 1958 Restrictions apply to Blocks 28 and 29.Â \r\n  We reverse the grant of summary judgment on this issue.\r\n3.Â  Appellants argue the\r\n  court erred in granting summary judgment by finding that the division of Blocks\r\n  28 and 29 into seven different lots, as shown on the 1955 Plat, constituted a\r\n  mere &quot;proposed plan&quot; to subdivide.Â  We agree.\r\nThe 1955 Plat and a\r\n  map attached to the 1972 Order show Blocks 28 and 29 divided into seven\r\n  different lots.Â  The trial court concluded that the maps indicated only a\r\n  proposed plan to subdivide Blocks 28 and 29 because &quot;[t]raditionally,\r\n  dotted lines on maps indicate proposed boundary lines or subdivision proposals\r\n  and are not symbolic of the final decree of the Grantor.&quot;Â  Viewed in the\r\n  light most favorable to Appellants, there is more than one reasonable inference\r\n  that may be drawn from the evidence regarding whether or not the grantor\r\n  intended for Blocks 28 and 29 to be subdivided into seven individual lots.Â  Law,\r\n  368 S.C. at 434, 629 S.E.2d at 648.Â  Therefore, we reverse the grant of summary\r\n  judgment on this issue and remand for trial.Â  \r\n4.Â  Appellants argue the\r\n  court erred in granting summary judgment by finding that because they had\r\n  actual notice of the 1972 Order and its restrictive effect on Appellants' use\r\n  of the property, they could not avail themselves of the protection of the\r\n  Shelter Rule.Â  We agree.\r\nAppellants\r\n  presented evidence that the Horry County Clerk of Court indexed the 1972 Order\r\n  only against the named defendants to that action.Â  Carmen Ward, Appellants'\r\n  predecessor in title, was a plaintiff and not a named defendant in the 1972\r\n  litigation.Â  Therefore, when Appellants performed a title search for Blocks 28\r\n  and 29, the 1972 Order did not appear in their chain of title.Â  Pursuant to\r\n  Section 30-9-40 of the South Carolina Code (2007), proper indexing supplies\r\n  inquiry notice of an instrument, while recordation without proper indexing\r\n  supplies no notice at all.Â  Thomas v. Thomas, 286 S.C. 294, 298, 333\r\n  S.E.2d 76, 78 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  The failure to index a judgment as required by\r\n  statute deprives it of its effectiveness as notice to subsequent purchasers.Â  Id.Â  \r\nAppellants admit\r\n  they had actual notice of the 1972 Order but seek the protection of their\r\n  predecessors in title by arguing that the Meeses were bona fide purchasers for\r\n  value without notice.Â  \r\n\r\n  The\r\n    &quot;Shelter Rule&quot; provides that one who is not a bona fide purchaser,\r\n    but who takes an interest in property from a bona fide purchaser, may be\r\n    sheltered in the latter's protective status.Â  The purpose of this rule is to\r\n    prevent a stagnation of property and to protect the first purchaser, who, being\r\n    entitled to hold and enjoy, must be equally entitled to sell.Â  Otherwise, a\r\n    bona fide purchaser might be prevented from selling the property for full\r\n    value. . . . It is wholly immaterial of what nature the outstanding interest\r\n    is, whether it is a lien or encumbrance, or a trust, or any other claim.\r\n\r\n77 Am. Jur. 2d Vendor and\r\n  Purchaser Â§ 419 (2006). Â This court has recognized the Shelter Rule,\r\n  holding the successor in interest of a bona fide purchaser for value stood in\r\n  the same position as the bona fide purchaser even when the successor had notice\r\n  of a lien.Â  Liberty Loan Corp. of Darlington v.

Farthing and all of Columbia, for Respondent. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM: Â Douglas McKown appeals his conviction and sentence for unlawful possession of\r\n  a prescription drug, arguing the trial court erred in denying his motion to\r\n  suppress and admitting certain evidence at the suppression hearing.Â  McKown also\r\n  challenges the admission of expert testimony concerning the nature of the\r\n  prescription drug and the trial court's denial of a directed verdict on the prescription\r\n  drug charge.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThe\r\n  circumstances surrounding this case stem from evidence seized from McKown's\r\n  home pursuant to the execution of a search warrant.Â  In furtherance of the\r\n  search warrant, police submitted an affidavit outlining various reports of drug\r\n  activity involving McKown and his former girlfriend, Erin Jenkins.Â  The warrant\r\n  affidavit also included details of a controlled buy of illegal drugs set up by\r\n  police with Jenkins approximately seventy-two hours before the issuance of the\r\n  warrant.Â  \r\nBased on the\r\n  information in the affidavit, the magistrate issued the search warrant for\r\n  McKown's home on May 6, 2006.Â  When the warrant was executed on May 12,\r\n  2006, Jenkins answered the door.Â  During the search, police found cocaine in\r\n  several locations within the home, including a bedroom containing both men's\r\n  and women's clothing.Â  Police also seized one-half of a pill alleged to be\r\n  Viagra.Â  McKown was not inside the home when the warrant was executed.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  July 20, 2006, McKown was indicted on charges of conspiracy, unlawful\r\n  possession of a controlled substance, distribution of a controlled substance,\r\n  and unlawful possession of a prescription drug.Â  Prior to trial, defense\r\n  counsel moved to suppress the evidence seized in the search, arguing the\r\n  warrant was not supported by probable cause.Â  Defense counsel also maintained\r\n  the affidavit contained false and misleading information concerning where\r\n  Jenkins was living at the time of the controlled buy.Â  Specifically, counsel\r\n  alleged that Jenkins had moved out of McKown's residence and that the affiant knowingly\r\n  failed to disclose this information to the magistrate. Â \r\nFollowing\r\n  argument on the motion, the State sought to call Jenkins as an additional\r\n  witness to address McKown's claim of misrepresentation in the affidavit.Â \r\n  Defense counsel objected, arguing the State could not call another witness\r\n  after the parties rested their evidence and the witness could not supplement\r\n  the information contained in the affidavit.Â  The trial judge allowed Jenkins to\r\n  testify over defense counsel's objection.Â  Her testimony revealed that at the\r\n  time of the controlled buy, she had signed a lease on another residence and had\r\n  moved out of McKown's home; however, she testified she still came back to\r\n  McKown's home and stayed with him three or four nights per week.Â  Specifically,\r\n  when asked to estimate the amount of time she had spent between McKown's\r\n  residence and the other residence, Jenkins stated &quot;I would say\r\n  fifty/fifty.&quot;Â  Following closing arguments, the trial judge denied the\r\n  motion to suppress and allowed the State to introduce the evidence seized in\r\n  the search.Â Â  \r\nAt\r\n  trial, the State elicited testimony from Officer Marvin Brown, the affiant and\r\n  supervisor on the night of the controlled buy.Â  Officer Brown testified that\r\n  cocaine and one-half of a Viagra pill was found in McKown's home.Â  Cynthia\r\n  Mitchum, a chemist in the drug analysis department of the York County Sheriff's\r\n  Department, testified she analyzed the substances seized in the search that\r\n  were alleged to be cocaine.Â  She did not, however, conduct a chemical analysis\r\n  of the pill alleged to be Viagra. Â Her identification of the substance alleged\r\n  to be Viagra was based on a comparison of the pill to a tablet in a controlled\r\n  substance book referred to as the PDR, or the Physicians' Desk Reference.[1]Â  Defense\r\n  witnesses Kevin Bolin, William Bolin, Neal Mitchell, and Michael Howe each\r\n  testified that McKown purchased Viagra during a recent trip to Costa Rica.\r\nDefense\r\n  counsel moved for a directed verdict on the unlawful possession of a\r\n  prescription drug charge on the basis that no foundation had been laid and no\r\n  chemical analysis had been conducted.Â  The trial judge denied the motion, and\r\n  the jury returned a guilty verdict on the charge.Â  McKown was acquitted on the\r\n  remaining charges and sentenced to one year in prison, suspended upon the\r\n  service of one year of probation.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;In\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Baccus,&nbsp;367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220&nbsp;(2006).Â  This\r\n  Court is bound by the trial court's factual findings unless the findings are\r\n  clearly erroneous.Â  Id.Â  A trial court's ruling on the admission or\r\n  exclusion of evidence will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion. Â State v. Douglas, 369 S.C. 424, 429, 632 S.E.2d 845, 847-48\r\n  (2006). Â Searches based on warrants will be given judicial deference to the\r\n  extent that an otherwise marginal search may be justified if it meets a\r\n  realistic standard of probable cause.Â  State v. Bennett, 256 S.C. 234,\r\n  241, 182 S.E.2d 291, 294 (1971).Â  \r\nANALYSIS\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, McKown maintains the trial court committed reversible error in: (1)\r\n  denying his motion to suppress the evidence seized from his residence; (2)\r\n  admitting additional evidence at the suppression hearing; (3) admitting expert\r\n  testimony concerning the nature of the prescription drug; and (4) denying his\r\n  motion for a directed verdict on the prescription drug charge.Â  We affirm. \r\n1. As\r\n  to whether the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress: Â We\r\n  conclude the search warrant affidavit provided the magistrate with a sufficient\r\n  basis for finding probable cause to issue the search warrant.Â  Specifically, the\r\n  details in the affidavit pertaining to the events taking place seventy-two\r\n  hours prior to the issuance of the warrant, namely the circumstances of the\r\n  controlled buy, presented a fair probability that drugs and other contraband\r\n  would be found at the residence.Â  See State v. Dupree, 354 S.C.\r\n  676, 691, 583 S.E.2d 437, 445 (Ct. App. 2003) (noting that a controlled buy, if\r\n  properly conducted, can alone provide facts sufficient to establish probable\r\n  cause for a search warrant); United States v. Grossman, 400 F.3d 212,\r\n  217 (4th Cir. 2005) (&quot;[A] sufficient nexus can exist between a defendant's\r\n  criminal conduct and his residence even when the affidavit supporting the\r\n  warrant contains no factual assertions directly linking the items sought to the\r\n  defendant's residence.&quot;) (internal quotations omitted); United States\r\n    v. Anderson, 851 F.2d 727, 729 (4th Cir. 1988) (&quot;[T]he nexus between\r\n  the place to be searched and the items to be seized may be established by the\r\n  nature of the item and the normal inferences of where one would likely keep\r\n  such evidence.&quot;).Â  Furthermore, the information in the affidavit concerning\r\n  various reports of drug activity involving McKown and Jenkins formed the basis\r\n  of an ongoing police investigation which, when coupled with the information\r\n  pertaining to the last seventy-two hours of that investigation, established a\r\n  probable continuing course of drug activity. Â See State v. Thompson,\r\n  363 S.C. 192, 207, 609 S.E.2d 556, 564 (Ct. App. 2005) (noting that in cases\r\n  involving alleged drug conspiracies, courts have relaxed the requirements of\r\n  staleness due to the continuous nature of such activity); Dupree, 354\r\n  S.C. at 690, 583 S.E.2d at 444 (&quot;Where the affidavit is based in part on\r\n  information provided by an informant of unknown reliability, police\r\n  corroboration of details provided in the tip may establish probable\r\n  cause.&quot;).Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying the motion\r\n  to suppress, and the evidence seized as a result of the search was properly\r\n  admitted at trial.[2]Â  See State v. Dunbar, 361 S.C. 240, 246, 603 S.E.2d 615, 618-19\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004) (&quot;A reviewing court should give substantial deference to a\r\n  magistrate's determination of probable cause.&quot;).\r\n2. As to whether\r\n  the trial court erred in admitting additional evidence at the suppression\r\n  hearing:Â  At\r\n  the in camera hearing on the motion to suppress, the State was permitted, over\r\n  defense counsel's objection, to reopen the matter and call Jenkins as a witness\r\n  to testify as to whether she was living at McKown's residence at the time the\r\n  warrant was issued. Â We\r\n  find no abuse of discretion in the trial judge's decision to allow the State to\r\n  present the testimony as a means of refuting defense counsel's argument\r\n  concerning the falsity of the affiant's statement.Â  Such evidence is pertinent\r\n  to a Franks review.Â  See State v. Humphery, 276 S.C. 42,\r\n  43, 274 S.E.2d 918, 918 (1981) (stating a motion to reopen the evidentiary\r\n  record and to allow additional evidence is addressed to the sound discretion of\r\n  the trial judge).Â  \r\n3. As\r\n  to whether the trial court erred in admitting expert testimony concerning the\r\n  nature of the pill:Â  We find no prejudice.Â  While we question whether counsel should\r\n  have objected at the moment the expert testified the pill was Viagra, rather\r\n  than when the State moved to actually introduce the pill into evidence, we\r\n  proceed to analyze this issue in an abundance of caution as the sequence of\r\n  events occurred so closely together.[3]Â  Assuming,\r\n  arguendo, that the admission of the expert's testimony was error, we find no\r\n  prejudice given prior testimony in the record identifying the pill as Viagra. Â Specifically,\r\n  during direct examination of the State's first witness, Officer Brown testified\r\n  without objection that he found one-half of a Viagra pill in the residence.Â  Because there\r\n  was no contemporaneous objection to this testimony identifying the\r\n  pill as Viagra,\r\n  any alleged error in the admission of the expert's testimony concerning the identity\r\n  of the pill was harmless. Â See State v. Schumpert,\r\n  312 S.C. 502, 507, 435 S.E.2d 859, 863 (1993) (finding any error in admission\r\n  of evidence cumulative to other unobjected-to evidence is harmless); State\r\n    v. Blackburn, 271 S.C. 324, 329, 247 S.E.2d 334, 337 (1978) (recognizing\r\n  admission of improper evidence is harmless where the evidence is merely\r\n  cumulative to other evidence).Â  Moreover, while not dispositive of our\r\n  resolution of this issue, we find our harmless error analysis bolstered by\r\n  counsel's statement at oral argument that, as part of his trial strategy, he suggested\r\n  to the jury in closing argument that if it were inclined to find the defendant\r\n  guilty, then it should find him guilty of possession of Viagra.[4]Â  \r\n4. Finally, as\r\n  to whether\r\n  the trial court erred in denying McKown's request for a directed verdict on the\r\n  unlawful possession of a prescription drug charge: Â There is no indication in\r\n  the record that the motion was renewed at the close of all evidence; thus, this\r\n  issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  See State v.\r\n    Bailey, 368 S.C. 39, 43 n.4, 626 S.E.2d 898, 900 n.4 (Ct. App. 2006)\r\n  (&quot;If a defendant presents evidence after the denial of his directed\r\n  verdict motion at the close of the State's case, he must make another directed\r\n  verdict motion at the close of all evidence in order to appeal the sufficiency\r\n  of the evidence.&quot;). Â Counsel\r\n  acknowledged at oral argument that the record does not reveal he renewed the\r\n  directed verdict motion.Â  While we note counsel's assertion of his longstanding\r\n  practice to renew a directed verdict motion at the appropriate time, our review\r\n  of the matter is nonetheless confined to the record on appeal which offers no\r\n  indication the motion was renewed at the close of all evidence. Â Notwithstanding,\r\n  as indicated, Officer Brown's testimony, without objection, identified the pill\r\n  as Viagra.Â  Moreover, four defense witnesses indicated McKown purchased Viagra\r\n  on a recent trip.Â  Consequently, the issue was properly submitted to the jury.Â  See State v. Pinckney, 339 S.C. 346, 349, 529 S.E.2d 526, 527\r\n  (2000) (&quot;If the State presents any evidence which reasonably tends to\r\n  prove the defendant's guilt, or from which the defendant's guilt could be\r\n  fairly and logically deduced, the case must go to the jury.&quot;); United\r\n    States v. Dolan, 544 F.2d 1219, 1221 (4th Cir. 1976) (â€œ[L]ay testimony and\r\n  circumstantial evidence may be sufficient, without the introduction of an\r\n  expert chemical analysis, to establish the [identity] of the substance involved\r\n  in an alleged narcotics transaction.â€); see also United States v.\r\n    Uwaeme, 975 F.2d 1016, 1019 (4th Cir. 1992) (noting that federal courts do\r\n  not require scientific certainty in determining the chemical composition of an\r\n  alleged controlled substance).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nPIEPER\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Defense counsel\r\n  stipulated that McKown did not have a prescription for Viagra.\r\n[2] McKown also\r\n  maintains that the affiant knew Jenkins had moved out of McKown's home at the\r\n  time the warrant was issued and that the affiant knowingly provided false and\r\n  misleading information concerning where she was living.Â  Consequently, McKown\r\n  requests that the alleged misleading information be disregarded in considering\r\n  the sufficiency of the affidavit to establish probable cause.Â  See Franks\r\n    v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 171-72 (1978) (stating a warrant may be rendered\r\n  void where omissions are both material to the probable cause determination and\r\n  evidence is presented that the affiant deliberately misled the magistrate).Â  We\r\n  do not find a Franks violation here.Â  See Grossman, 400\r\n  F.3d at 218 (noting the mere fact the defendant splits his time among several\r\n  different homes does not invalidate the search); United States v. Williams,\r\n  974 F.2d 480, 482 (4th Cir. 1992) (finding sufficient nexus to search motel\r\n  room despite the short duration of defendant's stay).Â  Had the affidavit\r\n  included the fact Jenkins had signed a lease on another apartment and only\r\n  lived at McKown's home four days per week, the basis for probable cause would\r\n  not be diluted.Â  See State v. Missouri, 337 S.C. 548, 554, 524\r\n  S.E.2d 394, 397 (1999) (&quot;There will be no Franks violation if the\r\n  affidavit . . . still contains sufficient information to establish probable\r\n  cause.&quot;).\r\n[3] In his brief on\r\n  appeal, McKown only challenges the admission of the testimony and not the\r\n  admission of the pill itself; thus, any argument concerning the admission of\r\n  the pill is arguably abandoned on appeal.Â  See Rule\r\n  208(b)(1)(D), SCACR (an issue not argued in the brief is deemed abandoned on\r\n  appeal); State v. Woods, 382 S.C. 153, 161, 676 S.E.2d 128, 132 (2009)\r\n  (holding appellant's failure to challenge the trial judge's finding renders\r\n  that ruling the law of the case).Â  Nonetheless, we find a separate basis\r\n  exists for admission of the pill due to Officer Brown's prior testimony,\r\n  without objection, that he found one-half of a Viagra pill in McKown's home. \r\n[4] After the verdict\r\n  was rendered, the record reflects counsel moved for a new trial, and noted\r\n  &quot;basically we conceded guilt on the charge.&quot;Â  While we note this\r\n  statement made after the jury's verdict might not be appropriately considered\r\n  as to the validity of the verdict, we do note it corroborates the message\r\n  counsel conveyed to the jury in closing argument as part of his trial strategy. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-353","title":"SCDSS v.

Â It noted final approval was contingent upon further review of\r\n  submitted detailed plans and specifications.Â  It reminded the Walkers to\r\n  include in their submission of final plans &quot;all necessary specifications,\r\n  drawings, landscaping plans, etc., according to Sandy Pointe covenants and\r\n  bylaws.&quot;Â  The Walkers submitted their application for their house in\r\n  December 2005.Â  The proposed location of the house was 88 feet from the road.Â \r\n  The Covenants require a minimum set-back of 40 feet.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  December 13, 2005, Committee member Tommy Britt informed Mr. Walker by phone\r\n  that the Committee was turning down the plans because of the proposed location\r\n  of the house. Â Without consulting the Walkers, their builder contacted the\r\n  members of the Committee and proposed moving the house back an additional 25\r\n  feet rather than 40 feet as desired by the Committee.Â  The members of the\r\n  Committee advised the builder to place stakes showing the revised location.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Committee formally gave written notice that it had disapproved the Walkers'\r\n  plans in a letter from its attorney dated January 11, 2006.Â  The attorney noted\r\n  that while the builder had advised the Committee that he would move the house\r\n  back some 26 feet, no revised plans had been submitted in accordance with the\r\n  Covenants. Â \r\nIn a\r\n  letter dated January 17, 2006, the Walkers' attorney responded that the Walkers\r\n  had at all times maintained the original proposed location was appropriate and\r\n  any other location was unacceptable.Â  He stated the Walkers intended to move\r\n  forward with construction of the house at that original location.Â  He advised\r\n  that he would accept service if the Committee sought injunctive relief.Â  The\r\n  Sandy Pointe Homeowners' Association (SPHA) and the Committee sent a letter to\r\n  the homeowners explaining the situation and asking the owners to vote on\r\n  whether the SPHA should pursue litigation in this matter.Â  Although the\r\n  majority of the homeowners voted in favor of litigation, the Board of the SPHA\r\n  did not file a complaint.Â  Instead, the Walkers brought this action seeking a declaratory\r\n  judgment ordering the Committee to approve and issue a permit for the\r\n  construction of their house and for damages arising from the delay in the\r\n  construction of the house. Â \r\nThe\r\n  trial court concluded a reasonable basis existed for the Committee's exercise\r\n  of judgment and the decision of the Committee was not arbitrary and bore a\r\n  sufficient relation to Sandy Pointe's general plan of development.Â  In\r\n  addition, the court rejected the Walkers' argument that the Committee was not\r\n  properly appointed as provided by the Covenants and by-laws of the SPHA.Â  The\r\n  Walkers filed a motion to reconsider, which the trial court denied.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA\r\n  declaratory judgment action is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined\r\n  by the nature of the underlying issue.Â  Felts v. Richland County, 303\r\n  S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991).Â  An action to enforce restrictive\r\n  covenants is an action in equity.Â  Buffington v. T.O.E. Enters., 383\r\n  S.C. 388, 393, 680 S.E.2d 289, 291 (2009).Â  On appeal from an equitable action,\r\n  an appellate court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the\r\n  evidence.Â  Townes Assocs. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221\r\n  S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  While this standard permits a broad scope of review,\r\n  an appellate court will not disregard the findings of the trial court, which\r\n  saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position to evaluate their\r\n  credibility. Â Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 237, 391\r\n  S.E.2d 538, 543 (1989).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.Â \r\n  Authority of Committee\r\nThe\r\n  Walkers assert the trial court erred in holding the Covenants provided the\r\n  Committee with the authority to reject the proposed location of their house.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nA\r\n  restrictive covenant is a voluntary contract between the parties.Â  Cedar\r\n    Cove Homeowners Ass'n, Inc. v. DiPietro, 368 S.C. 254, 261, 628 S.E.2d 284,\r\n  287 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Restrictions on the use of property will be strictly construed\r\n  with all doubts resolved in favor of the free use of the property; however the\r\n  rule of strict construction should not be used to defeat the plain and obvious\r\n  purpose of the restrictive covenants. Â Taylor v. Lindsey, 332 S.C. 1, 4,\r\n  498 S.E.2d 862, 864 (1998).Â  The language of a restrictive covenant is to be\r\n  construed according to the plain and ordinary meaning attributed to it at the\r\n  time of execution. Â Taylor, 332 S.C. at 4, 498 S.E.2d at 863. \r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  Covenants provide:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tNo\r\n  improvements shall be erected, placed, altered, or changed on any lot in the\r\n  subdivision until and unless the building plans, specifications and plot plan\r\n  showing the proposed type of constructions, exterior design, and location of\r\n  such improvement have been approved in writing by the Architectural Committee\r\n  as to conformity and harmony with external design and consistence of plan with\r\n  existing improvements on the other lots in the subdivision and as to the\r\n  location of the structure with respect to topography and finished ground\r\n  elevation.Â  . . .\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  most applicable definition of topography is &quot;the configuration of a\r\n  surface including its relief and the position of its natural and man-made\r\n  features . . . .&quot; Â Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 1244\r\n  (10th ed. 1993).Â  Thus, the Covenants give the Committee the right to approve\r\n  the location of a house with respect to the configuration of the land and\r\n  position of natural and man-made features.Â  We find this provision grants the\r\n  Committee authority over where on a lot a house should be located.\r\nB.Â \r\n  Exercise of Authority\r\nThe\r\n  Walkers contend the Committee did not properly exercise its authority.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nWhen\r\n  a covenant provides an architectural review board with broad authority for\r\n  approval of improvements, the architectural review board's discretion is\r\n  constrained only by reasonableness and good faith. Â River Hills Prop. Owners\r\n    Ass'n, Inc. v. Amato, 326 S.C. 255, 259, 487 S.E.2d 179, 181 (1997).Â  The\r\n  courts will uphold an architectural review board's rejection of a homeowner's\r\n  improvements based on aesthetic considerations when the board's decision is not\r\n  arbitrary but bears a sufficient relation to the subdivision's general plan of\r\n  development.Â  Sea Pines Plantation Co. v. Wells, 294 S.C. 266, 271, 363\r\n  S.E.2d 891, 894 (1987).Â  \r\nIn Palmetto\r\n  Dunes Resort v. Brown, 287 S.C. 1, 2, 336 S.E.2d 15, 16 (Ct. App. 1985),\r\n  the covenant granted the architectural review board the discretion to\r\n  disapprove plans for &quot;purely aesthetic considerations.&quot;Â  The\r\n  architectural review board denied approval of house plans because the garage\r\n  overpowered the house.Â  Id. at 7, 336 S.E.2d at 19.Â  This court held the\r\n  architectural review board's reasons for disapproval must bear a reasonable\r\n  relation to the other buildings or general plan of development and the board had\r\n  a right to disapprove plans that would mar the general appearance of the\r\n  subdivision and thus diminish the overall quality of the development.Â  Id. at 8, 336 S.E.2d at 19-20.\r\nThe\r\n  Committee disapproved the Walkers' plans because the location of the house was\r\n  too close to the road in comparison to the other houses on that side of the\r\n  road.Â  The other houses on that side of the road are more in alignment with the\r\n  lake line of the Army Corp of Engineers than the road.Â  Britt stated that in\r\n  the Walkers' proposed location, the house would have been &quot;way out&quot;\r\n  in front of the other houses and would have been a &quot;sore thumb.&quot; Joel\r\n  Herbert, another Committee member, testified that at the proposed location, the\r\n  house would have &quot;just stuck out.&quot;Â  The neighboring homeowners would\r\n  have been looking at the back of the Walkers' house from the front of theirs.Â \r\n  Britt explained he believed the Committee was charged with trying to balance\r\n  existing homes and where they were located in reference to the other homes\r\n  around them.Â  He acknowledged all of the lots in the subdivision were\r\n  different.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Walkers' builder testified he explained to the Committee it would be extremely\r\n  difficult to build the Walkers' house 40 feet further back because of the steep\r\n  drop-off of the land and the cost would probably be prohibitive.Â  The builder\r\n  testified moving the house back 25 feet would cost an additional $25,000.Â \r\n  However, he did not remember if he told the members about this cost. Â He stated\r\n  he would not build the house at the Committee's proposed location because the\r\n  slope would be too great. Â \r\nCommittee\r\n  members Joel Herbert and Donald Wafer both testified they would have accepted\r\n  the compromise location proposed by the Walkers' builder, but the Walkers never\r\n  filed an application for that location.Â  Although he acknowledged that moving\r\n  the house back would increase the building cost, Britt stated the Committee was\r\n  never informed what that cost would be.Â  Britt stated that if the Walkers moved\r\n  the house back an additional 40 feet as proposed by the Committee, it would not\r\n  be affected by the drop-off.Â  He explained that is why the Committee proposed\r\n  moving the house back only 40 feet rather than 75 feet, which would put the\r\n  Walkers' house in a better alignment with the other houses. Â Although the\r\n  Walkers' builder testified that he would not build the particular house chosen\r\n  by the Walkers at the Committee's selected location, other houses on that side\r\n  have been built on a slope.Â  Many of them have basements. Â \r\nWe\r\n  find the Committee's decision to deny the Walkers' application was not\r\n  arbitrary and bore a sufficient relation to the subdivision's general plan of\r\n  development.Â  Although the Covenants dictate a minimum set-back of 40 feet, the\r\n  Committee in its discretion can require a house to be constructed further back\r\n  than that.Â  An architectural review board's disapproval does not have to be\r\n  grounded upon a violation of a specific restrictive covenant.Â  River Hills\r\n    Prop. Owners Ass'n, Inc., 326 S.C. at 259, 487 S.E.2d at 181. Â Thus, we\r\n  find no error in the trial court upholding the Committee's decision rejecting\r\n  the Walkers' proposed location for their house.Â  \r\nC.Â \r\n  Notice of Committee's decision\r\nThe\r\n  Walkers' assert the Committee failed to provide them with written notice of the\r\n  denial of their application in a timely manner.Â  The Covenants provide:\r\n\r\n\tApplication\r\n  for approval as required herein shall be made to the Architectural Committee\r\n  and at the time of making such application, the building plans, specifications,\r\n  plot plans, and landscaping plans shall be submitted in duplicate.Â  One copy of\r\n  such plans and specifications will be retained by the committee and the other\r\n  copy will be returned to the applicant with approval or disapproval plainly\r\n  noted thereon.Â  In the event that the Architectural Committee fails to approve\r\n  or disapprove such plans within thirty (30) days after they have been submitted\r\n  to it, or if no suit to enjoin the erection or alteration of such building or\r\n  improvement has been commenced before such erection or alteration is\r\n  substantially completed, approval of the Architectural Committee will be\r\n  conclusively presumed and this covenant will be deemed to have been fully\r\n  complied with.Â  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Walkers submitted their application at the beginning of December 2005.Â  Britt\r\n  called Mr. Walker on December 13, 2005 to inform him the Committee had rejected\r\n  his application due to the proposed location of the house.Â  The Walkers'\r\n  builder soon thereafter contacted the members of the Committee to propose the\r\n  alternate location.Â  In a letter dated January 11, 2006, the Committee's\r\n  attorney gave the Walkers official written notice that the Committee had\r\n  disapproved the plans.Â  The attorney stated one basis for the disapproval was\r\n  the Walkers had failed to provide two sets of plans as required by the\r\n  Covenants.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Covenants provide the Committee should note its decision on the second set of\r\n  plans submitted with an application.Â  They require no other written notice.Â \r\n  Britt testified the Walkers submitted only one copy of plans.Â  From the cover\r\n  sheet, it appears they only submitted one copy of the elevation and house plans\r\n  for &quot;Bagwell Place,&quot; as well as only one copy of the landscaping plan\r\n  and subdivision map in their application.Â  Mr. Walker acknowledged he had only\r\n  submitted one copy of the landscaping plan but maintained he had submitted two\r\n  copies of the house plan.[1]Â \r\n  We find the Walkers failed to submit two copies of all of the plans in their\r\n  application as required by the Covenants.Â  As the Walkers failed to provide the\r\n  Committee with two copies, the Committee was unable to provide them with its\r\n  decision noted on the second copy of plans as provided by the Covenants.Â  It is\r\n  undisputed the Committee provided the Walkers verbal notice of its decision\r\n  within thirty days of the application and also provided written notice through\r\n  its attorney.Â  We find no error on this issue.\r\nD.Â \r\n  Appointment of Members of the Committee\r\nThe\r\n  Walkers assert the trial court erred in determining that general compliance was\r\n  all that was required in the appointment of the members of the Committee.Â  The\r\n  Covenants provide:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  Architectural Committee of said subdivision shall initially be composed of\r\n  David Porter, Robert W. Dorsey and Joel Herbert and one other lot owner chosen\r\n  by the above named.Â  In the event of a vacancy on the Architectural Committee,\r\n  or the failure or inability of any member to act, the vacancy shall be filled\r\n  by majority vote of the remaining members on said committee.Â  \r\n\r\nAt\r\n  the time the Walkers submitted their application to the Committee, the members\r\n  of the Committee were Joel Herbert, Toby Britt, Donald Wafer, and T.J. Fusco.Â \r\n  Herbert was one of the original members of the Committee and was named to the\r\n  Committee in the Covenants.Â  Wafer testified he and Britt volunteered at the\r\n  annual meeting to serve on the Committee.Â  There is no testimony of when Fusco\r\n  joined the Committee.Â  The Covenants do not prescribe the technical manner in\r\n  which the remaining members of the Committee were to vote on new members.Â \r\n  There is no evidence that the remaining members of the Committee did not vote\r\n  for Wafer, Britt, and Fusco when they joined the Committee.Â  We find no basis\r\n  for reversal on this issue.Â  See Weaver v. Recreation Dist., 328\r\n  S.C. 83, 88, 492 S.E.2d 79, 82 (1997) (noting an appealed order comes to the\r\n  appellate court with a presumption of correctness and the burden is on\r\n  appellant to demonstrate reversible error).\r\nE.Â \r\n  Failure to Provide Guidelines\r\nThe\r\n  Walkers take issue with the Committee's failure to provide the homeowners with\r\n  guidelines to be used in considering applications.Â  In the spring of 2001, the\r\n  members of the SPHA voted to amend the Covenants to include a provision that\r\n  the homeowners would be provided with a Statement of Understanding listing the\r\n  guidelines used by the Committee when reviewing plans.Â  The document was to\r\n  &quot;include the requirements necessary to ensure the conformity and harmony\r\n  of homes in the neighborhood.&quot;Â  The Committee, however, has never prepared\r\n  or distributed the guidelines.Â  The Walkers have offered no evidence the\r\n  Committee's review of their application would have been any different if the\r\n  Committee had created the guidelines.Â  We find no reversible error on this\r\n  issue.Â  See McCall v. Finley, 294 S.C. 1, 4, 362 S.E.2d 26, 28\r\n  (Ct. App. 1987) (&quot;[W]hatever doesn't make any difference, doesn't\r\n  matter.&quot;).Â  We find no reversible error.Â  \r\nF.Â \r\n  Vote of Homeowners in Favor of Litigation\r\nThe\r\n  Walkers also contend the SPHA acted improperly in sending what they contend to\r\n  be a biased ballot asking the homeowners whether they supported bringing an\r\n  action against the Walkers.Â  The vote by the members was advisory only.Â  The\r\n  By-Laws of the SPHA authorize the Board of the SPHA &quot;to bring proceedings\r\n  on behalf of or against the Owners concerning Sandy Pointe, and to defend\r\n  proceedings brought against Sandy Pointe.&quot;Â  The SPHA was authorized to\r\n  defend this action without a vote by the homeowners.Â  Thus, even if the vote\r\n  were somehow improper, it is irrelevant to our decision.Â  See Finley,\r\n  294 S.C. at 4, 362 S.E.2d at 28 (&quot;[W]hatever doesn't make any difference,\r\n  doesn't matter.&quot;).Â  We find no reversible error.Â  \r\nG.Â \r\n  Election of Board of Directors\r\nThe\r\n  Walkers assert &quot;None of the Defendants could testify that there was a duly\r\n  elected board of directors . . . .&quot;Â  They fail, however, to direct this\r\n  court's attention to any evidence in the record that would support a finding\r\n  that the SPHA Board of Directors was not duly-elected.Â  See Weaver,\r\n  328 S.C. at 88, 492 S.E.2d at 82 (noting an appealed order comes to the\r\n  appellate court with a presumption of correctness and the burden is on\r\n  appellant to demonstrate reversible error); McCall v. IKON, 380 S.C.\r\n  649, 660, 670 S.E.2d 695, 701 (Ct. App. 2008) (stating the appellate court is\r\n  &quot;obliged to reverse when error is called to our attention, but we are not\r\n  in the business of figuring out on our own whether error exists&quot;).\r\n  Accordingly, we find the Walkers failed to meet their burden of demonstrating\r\n  reversible error.\r\nH.Â \r\n  Record Keeping\r\nThe\r\n  Walkers claim the HOA and Committee failed to maintain adequate records.Â  Even\r\n  if this assertion is true, it would make no difference to the court's\r\n  decision.Â  See Finley, 294 S.C. at 4, 362 S.E.2d at 28 (&quot;[W]hatever\r\n  doesn't make any difference, doesn't matter.&quot;).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the\r\n  above stated reasons, the order of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF,\r\n  SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Mr. Walker may have been including the plans he\r\n  had submitted in 2001 for the &quot;Bagwell&quot; home, which he had printed\r\n  off the internet.Â  The plan he submitted in 2005 was for &quot;Bagwell\r\n  Place,&quot; which was a revision of the house the Walkers had originally\r\n  submitted to the Committee.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-355","title":"Nash v.

Nash, d/b/a B&amp;B Rentals, and the other Appellants appeal the trial court's\r\n  ruling that restrictive covenants for Tara Plantation subdivision apply to\r\n  their lots.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nBob\r\n  McLemore (Developer), acting in several corporate names, was the developer of\r\n  Tara Plantation subdivision near Fort Mill, South Carolina.Â  On February 16,\r\n  1988, Developer filed a plat entitled &quot;A Final Plat Showing Maco\r\n  Commercial Park and Tara Plantation.&quot;Â  Notes on the plat provided:\r\n  &quot;Tara Plantation Lots 1-57 zoned RD-1&quot;, which meant residential use,\r\n  and &quot;Maco Commercial Park Lots A-F zoned BD-1&quot;, which meant\r\n  commercial use.Â  The lots in the Maco Commercial Park (Maco Lots) were at the\r\n  front of the property owned by Developer on either side of Old Tara Lane.Â  The\r\n  plat was filed in Plat Book 91 at Page 128 of the York County RMC Office.Â  On\r\n  February 25, 1988, Developer filed restrictive covenants (Covenants), which\r\n  provided:\r\n\r\n\tKNOW\r\n  ALL PERSONS BY THESE PRESENTS, THAT BOB MCLEMORE AND CO., INC., being the owner\r\n  of the real property located in Fort Mill Township, York County, South\r\n  Carolina, constituting that certain subdivision known as Tara Plantation, a map\r\n  of which is recorded in Plat Book 91 at Page 129 of the York\r\n  County, South Carolina, RMC office, does hereby covenant and agree with all\r\n  persons, firms or corporations hereafter acquiring any of the lots shown on\r\n  said map, that said lots shall be subject to the following restrictive\r\n  covenants, governing the use thereof, which shall run with the property by\r\n  whomsoever owned.Â  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Covenants provided:Â  &quot;All lots shown on said map shall be used for\r\n  residential purposes only.&quot;Â  In addition, the Covenants stated:Â \r\n  &quot;Nothing herein contained shall be construed as imposing any covenants and\r\n  restrictions on any property of the owner of this subdivision other than the\r\n  property to which these restrictive covenants specifically apply.&quot;Â  The Covenants\r\n  do not expressly exclude or include the Maco Lots.Â  \r\nA\r\n  plat substantially similar to the original plat was filed at Book 95, page\r\n  136.Â  Developer, as Bob McLemore Homes (BMH) built a model home on Maco Lot B.Â \r\n  Developer sold Maco Lot F to Alan and Patricia Crump on April 10, 1992.Â  Lots\r\n  B, C, E, and F were rezoned for residential use on June 15, 1992.Â  The\r\n  remaining lots were rezoned for residential use on April 18, 1994.Â  On April\r\n  22, 1994, a plat was filed showing a revision of Lots A, B, C, D, and E of Maco\r\n  Commercial Park to be known as Lots 61-67 of Tara Plantation.Â  In 1995,\r\n  Developer as BMH defaulted on the mortgage on Lot B.Â  Home Federal Savings and\r\n  Loan Association, which acquired title at the foreclosure sale, sold the\r\n  property to the Mitchells.Â  The current owners, Paige and William Howarth\r\n  acquired the property after it was foreclosed.Â  Developer filed for bankruptcy\r\n  in October of 1994.Â  The bankruptcy trustee sold Lots 61-63 (formerly Maco Lots\r\n  C-D) and Lot 65 (formerly Lot A), while Developer sold the remaining lot in\r\n  1996.Â  The Appellants are the current owners of what were the Maco Lots.Â  \r\nBen\r\n  J. Nash, Billy F. Stegall, Jr., and Joseph H. Stegall, the current owners of\r\n  what are now known as Lots 61 and 62 of Tara Plantation, brought this\r\n  declaratory judgment action against the Tara Plantation Homeowners Association\r\n  (TPHOA) requesting the court declare their lots unencumbered by the Covenants.Â \r\n  The TPHOA asserted a counterclaim against Nash and the Stegalls and a third party\r\n  claim against the other owners of the former Maco Lots seeking a declaration\r\n  the lots were subject to the Covenants and seeking collection of homeowner\r\n  association dues owed by the Appellants.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  trial court ruled the Covenants applied to the disputed lots based on the plain\r\n  language of the Covenants.Â  In addition, the court held even if an ambiguity\r\n  exists, Developer intended for the Covenants to apply to all lots on the plat,\r\n  including the disputed lots.Â  Furthermore, the court ruled Appellants were\r\n  estopped from asserting the Covenants did not apply to them, waived such\r\n  contention, and were barred by the doctrine of laches.Â  The court granted the\r\n  TPHOA judgment against the Appellants for the dues owed.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA declaratory\r\n  judgment action is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined by the nature\r\n  of the underlying issue. Â Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356,\r\n  400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991). Â The underlying issue in this case is whether the\r\n  restrictive covenants can be enforced against the Appellants' lots.Â  An action\r\n  to enforce restrictive covenants is an action in equity.Â  Buffington v.\r\n    T.O.E. Enter., 383 S.C. 388, 393, 680 S.E.2d 289, 291 (2009); see also Hardy v. Aiken, 369 S.C. 160, 165, 631 S.E.2d 539, 541 (2006) (stating\r\n  while action potentially might require the court to construe a contract, the\r\n  underlying action was a declaratory action to declare whether the restrictive\r\n  covenants were enforceable and thus the standard of review was for an action in\r\n  equity).Â  On appeal from an equitable action, an appellate court may find facts\r\n  in accordance with its own view of the evidence.Â  Townes Assocs. v. City of\r\n    Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  While this\r\n  standard permits a broad scope of review, an appellate court will not disregard\r\n  the findings of the trial court, which saw and heard the witnesses and was in a\r\n  better position to evaluate their credibility. Â Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro,\r\n    Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 237, 391 S.E.2d 538, 543 (1989).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.Â  Applicability of\r\n  Covenants\r\nAppellants argue\r\n  the trial court erred in concluding the Covenants apply to their lots.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nRestrictive\r\n  covenants are contractual in nature.Â  Hardy, 369 S.C. at 166, 631 S.E.2d\r\n  at 542.Â  A restriction on the use of the property must be created in express\r\n  terms or by plain and unmistakable implication.Â  Id.Â  Restrictions on\r\n  the use of property will be strictly construed with all doubts resolved in\r\n  favor of free use of the property; however the rule of strict construction\r\n  should not be used to defeat the plain and obvious purpose of the restrictive\r\n  covenants. Â Taylor v. Lindsey, 332 S.C. 1, 4, 498 S.E.2d 862, 863\r\n  (1998).Â  The language of a restrictive covenant is to be construed according to\r\n  the plain and ordinary meaning attributed to it at the time of execution. Â Id.\r\nA\r\n  restrictive covenant is ambiguous when its terms are reasonably susceptible of\r\n  more than one interpretation.Â  S.C. Dep't of Natural Res. v. Town of\r\n    McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 623, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302 (2001).Â  It is a\r\n  question of law for the court whether the language of a restrictive covenant is\r\n  ambiguous.Â  Id. at 623, 550 S.E.2d at 302-03.Â  Once the court decides\r\n  the language is ambiguous, evidence may be admitted to show the parties' intent.Â  Id. Â at 623, 550 S.E.2d at 303.Â  The determination of intent is then a\r\n  question of fact.Â  Id. \r\nWhen\r\n  restrictive covenants arise by implication, the restrictions are said to create\r\n  a reciprocal negative easement.Â  Bomar v. Echols, 270 S.C. 676, 679, 244\r\n  S.E.2d 308, 310 (1978).[1] Â Generally, four elements must be established to show a reciprocal negative\r\n  easement:Â  (1) a common grantor, (2) a designation of land subject to\r\n  restrictions, (3) a general plan or scheme of restrictions, and (4) the\r\n  covenants run with the land. Â Id.Â  In the various grants of the lots,\r\n  there must have been included some restriction for the benefit of the land\r\n  retained evidencing a scheme or intent that the entire tract would be similarly\r\n  treated, so that once the plan has been effectively put into operation, the\r\n  burden placed upon the land conveyed is by operation of law reciprocally placed\r\n  upon the land retained.Â  Gambrell v. Schriver, 312 S.C. 354, 358, 440\r\n  S.E.2d 393, 395 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  In determining whether a reciprocal negative\r\n  easement has been created, the court should consider not only the language of\r\n  the deeds, but also the circumstances surrounding the origin of the covenants. Â Id.Â \r\n  Generally, the developer must establish the general scheme of development\r\n  before any lots are sold.Â  Id.Â  All doubts regarding the creation of an\r\n  implied reciprocal negative easement must be resolved in favor of the freedom\r\n  of land from restriction.Â  Id.\r\nThe\r\n  Covenants state they apply to &quot;any of the lots shown on [the] map&quot;\r\n  recorded in Plat Book 91, Page 129, which is the plat showing the Tara\r\n  Plantation Lots, as well as the Maco Lots.Â  The Covenants do not expressly exclude\r\n  the Maco Lots.Â  However, the Covenants, which provide the lots will be used for\r\n  residential purposes only, are in conflict with the Plat, which states the Maco\r\n  Lots are zoned for commercial use.Â  \r\nDeveloper's\r\n  brother Danny Charles McLemore, who served as Director of Sales for his\r\n  brother's company, testified that in developing a subdivision, Developer would\r\n  have the front of the property zoned commercial and place a model home there.Â \r\n  He would then use the model home for sales to the public, would hold real\r\n  estate days there, and would allow dignitaries to use it for dinners.Â  Once the\r\n  subdivision was finished, Developer would have the model home rezoned\r\n  residential and would place the same restrictions on it as the rest of the\r\n  subdivision.Â  He stated he had &quot;always thought [the Maco Lots] would be\r\n  back as residential homes.&quot;Â  At the time he left Developer's company, the\r\n  Maco Lots were all vacant except for the model home.Â  Shortly thereafter, the\r\n  company went bankrupt.Â  \r\nDeveloper's son,\r\n  Thad McLemore, who was Assistant Vice President for his father's company, testified\r\n  the original intent for the subdivision was for all of the lots to be\r\n  residential.Â  The application to rezone lots B, C, E, and F as residential lots\r\n  stated the reason for the rezoning was to keep with the original intent for the\r\n  subdivision. Â \r\nThe evidence shows\r\n  Developer intended for the restrictive covenants to apply to all of the lots\r\n  shown on the Plat once they were sold to homeowners, including the Maco Lots.Â  Developer\r\n  established a general scheme of development before any of the lots were sold\r\n  and designated the lots shown on the Plat as being subject to the restrictive\r\n  covenants.Â  As the Maco Lots were rezoned residential, the conflict with the\r\n  restrictive covenants was removed.Â  The evidence shows the only reason\r\n  Developer originally had the Maco Lots zoned commercial was to allow for the\r\n  model home to be used for sales and similar purposes.Â  The model home,\r\n  otherwise, was consistent with the requirements of the Covenants.Â  A revised\r\n  plat was filed to show that the Maco Lots were renamed as Tara Plantation Lots.Â \r\n  All of the Appellants except the Crumps acquired their lots after the revision\r\n  and their deeds designate their lots as being part of Tara Plantation.Â \r\n  Although the Crumps purchased their lot from Developer before the renaming of the\r\n  Maco Lots, their lot was rezoned residential after they entered into a\r\n  contract.Â  Furthermore, the Crumps' mortgage refers to their property as\r\n  &quot;Lot F, Tara Plantation.&quot;Â  \r\nThe Appellants were\r\n  aware of the restrictions and all of them paid dues to the TPHOA.Â  In addition,\r\n  many of the Appellants voted on amendments to the Covenants and participated in\r\n  TPHOA meetings.Â  On May 19, 2005, lead plaintiff Nash wrote to the president of\r\n  the TPHOA requesting a release of his lots from the Covenants. Â \r\nConsidering all of\r\n  the surrounding circumstances, we find Developer intended for the Covenants to\r\n  apply to Appellants' lots.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court did not err in\r\n  holding the Covenants could be enforced against Appellants.Â  \r\nB.Â  Estoppel and waiver\r\nThe Appellants\r\n  argue the trial court improperly held they were barred from asserting the\r\n  restrictive covenants did not apply to their lots under the equitable doctrines\r\n  of estoppel and waiver.Â  We disagree.Â  Â \r\nThe Appellants\r\n  claim these doctrines are not applicable because they cannot be used as\r\n  offensive weapons.Â  \r\n\r\n\tEstoppel\r\n  and waiver are protective only, and are to be invoked as shields, and not as\r\n  offensive weapons. Their operation in all cases should be limited to saving\r\n  harmless or making whole the party in whose favor they arise and should not, in\r\n  any case, be made the instruments of gain or profit. While the doctrine of\r\n  waiver or equitable estoppel may be invoked as affirmative defenses to\r\n  counterclaims, they may not be asserted in a complaint as offensive weapons. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nJanasik v. Fairway Oaks\r\n  Villas Horizontal Prop. Regime, 307 S.C.\r\n  339, 345, 415 S.E.2d 384, 388 (1992) (citations omitted).Â  \r\nIn Janasick,\r\n  homeowners sought an injunction to prevent a regime and management company from\r\n  requiring them to remove improvements constructed in violation of covenants.Â  Id. Â at 341, 415 S.E.2d at 386.Â  They asserted in their complaint equitable\r\n  estoppel and waiver.Â  Id.Â  The regime and management company\r\n  counterclaimed seeking an injunction enforcing the covenants.Â  Id. at\r\n  342, 415 S.E.2d at 386.Â  While the supreme court affirmed the master's finding that\r\n  evidence supported the homeowners' entitlement to benefits arising in their\r\n  favor under equitable considerations, it reversed to the extent his ruling let\r\n  stand those portions of the complaint that alleged the affirmative defenses of\r\n  equitable estoppel and waiver.Â  Id. at 345, 415 S.E.2d at 388.Â  \r\nThe TPHOA\r\n  is the party seeking to maintain the status quo and is using the equitable\r\n  doctrines of estoppel and waiver as &quot;shields.&quot;Â  The TPHOA did not\r\n  assert the equitable doctrines in a complaint but rather in response to Nash's\r\n  and the Stegalls' claims.Â  The other Appellants asserted a counterclaim asking\r\n  for a declaration that the Covenants do not apply.Â  Although there is not a\r\n  responsive pleading to this counterclaim in the record, the Appellants do not\r\n  raise any issue concerning the lack of the responsive pleading.Â  We find Janasek does not prevent the TPHOA's use of these doctrines.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Appellants also assert the equitable doctrines may only be used to bar\r\n  enforcement of covenants.Â  However, this is an action in equity.Â  The appellate\r\n  courts have &quot;consistently held that courts should consider equitable\r\n  doctrines when determining whether to enforce a restrictive covenant . . .\r\n  .&quot;Â  Buffington v. T.O.E. Enter., 383 S.C. 388, 393, 680 S.E.2d 289,\r\n  291 (2009).Â  \r\nIn Seabrook\r\n  Island Property Owners Association v. Pelzer, 292 S.C. 343, 348, 356 S.E.2d\r\n  411, 414 (Ct. App. 1987), this court found the appellant was estopped from\r\n  seeing a refund of assessments, even though the assessment violated the\r\n  applicable restrictive covenants and bylaws.Â  The court held:\r\n\r\n\t[The\r\n  appellant] acquiesced in the method of assessment and paid the charges. The\r\n  Association expended the moneys for purposes authorized by the by-laws.Â  [The\r\n  appellant] received the benefit of those expenditures. Â He cannot now return\r\n  the benefits or restore the Association to its former position . . . .Â  If a\r\n  party stands by and sees another dealing with his property in a manner\r\n  inconsistent with his rights and makes no objection while the other changes his\r\n  position, his silence is acquiescence and it estops him from later seeking\r\n  relief.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nWe\r\n  find the trial court did not err in considering the equitable doctrines.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  next consider whether the trial court erred in its application of the\r\n  doctrines.Â  &quot;The doctrine of estoppel applies if a person, by his actions,\r\n  conduct, words or silence which amounts to a representation, or a concealment\r\n  of material facts, causes another to alter his position to his prejudice or\r\n  injury.&quot;Â  Rushing v. McKinney, 370 S.C. 280, 293, 633 S.E.2d 917,\r\n  924 (Ct. App. 2006)Â  The elements of equitable estoppel as to the party\r\n  estopped are: Â (1) conduct amounting to a false representation or concealment\r\n  of material facts, or, at least, which is calculated to convey the impression\r\n  that the facts are otherwise than, and inconsistent with, those which the party\r\n  subsequently attempts to assert; (2) the intention or expectation that such conduct\r\n  will be acted upon by the other party; and (3) actual or constructive knowledge\r\n  of the real facts.Â  S. Dev. Land &amp; Golf Co., v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Auth.,\r\n  311 S.C. 29, 33, 426 S.E.2d 748, 750 (1993).Â  The elements as to the party\r\n  claiming the estoppel, are: Â (1) lack of knowledge and of the means of\r\n  knowledge of the truth as to the facts in question, (2) reliance upon the\r\n  conduct of the party estopped, and (3) prejudicial change in position. Â Id.\r\nWaiver is defined\r\n  as &quot;a voluntary and intentional abandonment or relinquishment of a known\r\n  right. Generally, the party claiming waiver must show that the party against\r\n  whom waiver is asserted possessed, at the time, actual or constructive\r\n  knowledge of his rights or of all the material facts upon which they\r\n  depended.&quot;Â  Janasik, 307 S.C. at 344, 415 S.E.2d at 387-88.Â \r\n  &quot;The doctrine of waiver does not necessarily imply that the party\r\n  asserting waiver has been misled to his prejudice or into an altered\r\n  position.&quot;Â  Id. at 344, 415 S.E.2d at 388.\r\nAs stated above,\r\n  the Appellants paid dues, voted on TPHOA issues, and participated in meetings\r\n  for years before asserting their lots were not bound by the Covenants.Â  The\r\n  Appellants had access to the same facts that give rise to their current\r\n  contention they are not bound by the Covenants.Â  During this time, the TPHOA\r\n  maintained the entranceway to the subdivision with landscaping, lighting, and\r\n  placement of a sign. Â Until Nash and the Stegalls brought this action in\r\n  December of 2005, none of the Appellants took any action inconsistent with their\r\n  lots being bound.Â  The trial court held: Â The TPHOA was &quot;prejudiced by the\r\n  [Appellants'] delay by spending money and effort regarding the landscaping\r\n  improvements, sign and lights adjacent to the [Appellants'] properties, all of\r\n  which implicitly considered the disputed lots as part of the subdivision and\r\n  was done without any reason to believe such a contention would be made.&quot;Â  We\r\n  find the evidence supports this finding.Â  Accordingly, we find no error in the\r\n  trial court's ruling that the Appellants are estopped from or have waived their\r\n  contention the Covenants do not apply to their lots.[2]Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the above\r\n  stated reason, the order of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, SHORT, and\r\n  WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Appellants assert the issue of negative reciprocal easement is not preserved.Â \r\n  This court may affirm for any ground appearing in the record. Â I'On v. Town\r\n    of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 418, 526 S.E.2d 716, 722 (2000).Â  It is not\r\n  always necessary for a respondent-as the winning party in the lower court-to\r\n  present its issues and arguments to the lower court and obtain a ruling on them\r\n  in order to preserve an issue for appellate review. Â Id. at 420, 526\r\n  S.E.2d at 723.Â  Thus, this court may address the issue of negative reciprocal\r\n  easement.Â  \r\n[2] Â We do not reach the issue of laches.Â  See Futch v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka,\r\n  Senior Assistant Attorney General William Edgar Salter, III, Office of the\r\n  Attorney General, of Columbia; Solicitor Robert M. Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  Â  Appellant, Darian K. Robinson, was convicted of murder and possession of a weapon during the\r\n  commission of a violent crime and was sentenced to life without parole.Â \r\n  Robinson appeals, asserting the trial judge denied him his right to\r\n  confrontation by ruling certain evidence relevant to his defense was\r\n  inadmissible until such time as Appellant established all four elements of\r\n  self-defense, resulting in shifting the burden to Appellant and denying him the\r\n  right to confront the State's witnesses during the State's case-in-chief.Â  We\r\n  affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nThis\r\n  case involves the shooting death of William Godwin (Victim) on January 26,\r\n  2005.Â  Latrice Atkinson, Appellant's live-in girlfriend and the cousin of\r\n  Victim, testified that in the early hours of the morning before the shooting,\r\n  she and Appellant argued, at which time Appellant hit Latrice in her face.Â \r\n  Later in the morning, one of Latrice's relatives asked her what was wrong with\r\n  her eye.Â  Latrice then observed a mark under her eye.Â  When the relative\r\n  pointed the injury out to Keith Williams, the father of Latrice's children,\r\n  Keith questioned Latrice about what happened. Â Latrice told him what occurred\r\n  but indicated Keith should not be concerned because she intended to take care\r\n  of the matter.Â  Keith learned from one of their children that the incident took\r\n  place in front of the children, but Latrice insisted she would handle the\r\n  problem by speaking to Appellant's father.Â  Her injuries consisted of a small\r\n  bruise under her eye and a swollen lip.Â  \r\nSammy\r\n  Groves testified that on January 26, he came into contact with Appellant\r\n  outside the Boulder Creek apartment where Appellant lived with Latrice.Â  At\r\n  that time, Appellant told Sammy that he had been fighting with Latrice and that\r\n  he had &quot;smacked&quot; her, resulting in both Keith and Victim confronting Appellant\r\n  about the matter.Â  Appellant was concerned about the situation with Victim and\r\n  Keith.Â  Sammy advised Appellant he should &quot;fight,&quot; and Appellant\r\n  responded that he had a .38 caliber gun.\r\nAround\r\n  11:30 that night, as Sammy and Appellant were still outside talking, Latrice\r\n  arrived at her apartment with Latrice's mother, Paulette Edens, and Latrice's\r\n  two children.Â  As they approached, they saw Appellant standing in front of the\r\n  door talking to Sammy.Â  Appellant began asking Latrice why she was &quot;telling\r\n  these lies,&quot; and then told her, &quot;You're people ain't going to be\r\n  rolling up on me, sitting in the parking lot like they going to do something to\r\n  me.&quot;Â  Appellant further stated, &quot;They don't know who I am&quot; and\r\n  referred to why others &quot;call him 187.&quot;[2]Â \r\n  Appellant was telling Latrice that her family and her children's father were\r\n  not going to be &quot;coming at him&quot; and threatening him.Â  Sammy testified\r\n  Appellant told Latrice she needed to stop sending her people at him, or he\r\n  would &quot;lay them down.&quot;Â  After putting her children to bed in her\r\n  apartment, Latrice went two doors over to her mother's apartment for their\r\n  customary time of drinking coffee.\r\nVictim,\r\n  who often joined his cousin and aunt in drinking coffee, then arrived at the\r\n  building and asked Appellant and Sammy where Latrice was.Â  Sammy told Victim\r\n  she was at her mother's apartment.Â  Victim went inside Paulette's home, came\r\n  back out shortly thereafter, drove off for a short period of time, and then\r\n  returned to Paulette's apartment.Â  During Victim's departure, Sammy went to his\r\n  girlfriend's apartment to retrieve his phone for Appellant to use.Â  When Sammy\r\n  returned, they went inside Latrice and Appellant's apartment and Appellant used\r\n  the phone to make two calls, one of which was to ask for a ride.Â  Thereafter, &quot;some\r\n  guys&quot; arrived at the apartment looking &quot;amped up, like [there] was\r\n  about to be a fight.&quot;Â  Appellant then walked past the group of people to\r\n  Paulette's door.Â  As he passed by, he told the group, &quot;ain't no use in y'all\r\n  catching a misdemeanor.&quot;Â  Sammy then heard gunshots coming from Paulette's\r\n  apartment.Â  When Appellant stepped out of the apartment, he had a gun down by\r\n  his side. \r\nLatrice\r\n  testified she, Victim, and her mother were in her mother's kitchen when they\r\n  heard a knock on the door.Â  Latrice opened the door and let Appellant into the\r\n  home.Â  Appellant followed behind Latrice as she walked to the kitchen, and he\r\n  continued to confront Latrice about telling lies and her family threatening\r\n  him.Â  Latrice indicated to Appellant that she did not know to what he was\r\n  referring. Â When he would not explain, Latrice told Appellant she was not going\r\n  to keep asking, and she joined her mother and Victim sitting at the kitchen\r\n  table.Â  Appellant was upset and mad, and as he continued to talk about Latrice's\r\n  family, Victim stood up and started walking toward Appellant. According to\r\n  Latrice, Victim had stopped walking and rested his hand against the wall.Â \r\n  Victim asked Appellant what he meant by &quot;family&quot; and whether he was\r\n  referring to Victim.Â  Appellant then took his hands out of his pockets and\r\n  Latrice heard two, loud firecracker sounds and then three or four more shots.Â \r\n  Victim fell to his knees and then to the ground.Â  Appellant turned around and\r\n  walked out the door.\r\nDuring\r\n  cross-examination, Appellant proffered the testimony of Latrice regarding\r\n  Victim's prior conviction.Â  Out of the presence of the jury, Latrice testified\r\n  she had learned Victim had been in jail on a murder charge, but denied\r\n  remembering having a discussion with Appellant about it.Â  She testified,\r\n  however, she did remember a conversation between Victim and Appellant referring\r\n  to &quot;the smell of blood or hurting somebody or killing somebody that . . .\r\n  leaves you with the memory of blood,&quot; and that both Victim and Appellant\r\n  were nodding and agreeing with one another on the subject.Â  The trial judge\r\n  found testimony of Latrice's knowledge of Victim's conviction irrelevant as it\r\n  did not show Appellant's knowledge, but found testimony about the blood\r\n  conversation between Appellant and Victim admissible.Â  Also during her\r\n  cross-examination, Appellant sought to elicit testimony from Latrice regarding\r\n  Latrice's sister, Jeanetta, and a man she had dated named Rocko. Â When asked\r\n  about a time Rocko &quot;had put his hands on Jeanetta,&quot; the State\r\n  objected and the trial judge sustained the objection to that question, as well\r\n  as to a question concerning Appellant's presence during a confrontation between\r\n  Victim and Rocko.Â  The trial judge gave Appellant the opportunity to thereafter\r\n  proffer the testimony of Latrice regarding an incident where Victim &quot;put\r\n  his hands on&quot; Rocko because Rocko had hit Jeanetta, and whether Rocko\r\n  related the incident between him and Victim in front of Appellant.Â  Latrice did\r\n  not remember the confrontation between Victim and Rocko being discussed in\r\n  front of Appellant but did remember having a conversation with Appellant wherein\r\n  she related to Appellant the incident that occurred between Jeanetta and Rocko.Â \r\n  The trial judge sustained the State's objection to this proffered testimony in\r\n  part because Latrice denied knowledge of the discussion regarding the incident\r\n  between Victim and Rocko taking place in Appellant's presence. \r\nThe\r\n  State also called Paulette to the stand, who testified that when Appellant\r\n  entered her home, he came into the kitchen and stood near Latrice as the two\r\n  bickered back and forth.Â  After Appellant stated, &quot;I'm tired of y'all and\r\n  y'all family,&quot; Victim got out of his chair and started walking and then\r\n  stopped.Â  When Victim was shot, he slumped to his knees and fell forward.Â \r\n  After Appellant shot Victim, he turned around and walked out the door as if he\r\n  had not done anything.\r\nVictim\r\n  was pronounced dead at the scene.Â  He suffered a total of three gunshot wounds,\r\n  with a gunshot to the head being the fatal wound.Â  \r\nAppellant\r\n  took the stand in his defense.Â  He admitted that the night before the shooting\r\n  he hit Latrice in her face.Â  According to Appellant, Victim later came to the\r\n  apartment Appellant shared with Latrice several times that day.Â  On the first\r\n  trip, Victim was upset and barged into the apartment, asking what was going on\r\n  between his cousin and Appellant.Â  Victim indicated Antonia told him Latrice\r\n  had injuries to her face.Â  He then warned Appellant before leaving the\r\n  apartment that he would kill Appellant if he was still there when he\r\n  returned.Â Â  Less than an hour later, Victim appeared again at the apartment and\r\n  stated he had already told Appellant if he was still there and he discovered\r\n  something was wrong with Latrice, he was going to kill Appellant.Â  Victim then\r\n  walked away, slamming the apartment door.Â  About one hour later, Victim\r\n  returned to the apartment a third time, &quot;bammin' on the door.&quot;Â  This\r\n  time Appellant did not open the door, but went to an upstairs window and\r\n  indicated to Victim he did not want any trouble.Â  Victim continued to knock on\r\n  the door a few minutes and then left.Â  Victim returned a fourth time, about\r\n  twenty to thirty minutes before Latrice came home, and again knocked on the\r\n  door.Â  At this point, Appellant maintains he was scared and nervous about\r\n  Victim's actions.Â  Victim stayed in the area about five minutes before he\r\n  eventually left in his car.Â  As Appellant was looking out the window, he saw\r\n  Sammy outside and yelled down to him.Â  Appellant then put on his jacket, which\r\n  he knew held a gun in the pocket, and went outside to talk to Sammy in order to\r\n  ask Sammy if he could use his phone.Â  Appellant explained to Sammy what had occurred\r\n  and told him about threats made to him by Keith and Victim.Â Â Â  Sammy retrieved\r\n  his phone and Appellant then made a phone call to his friend Travis, asking for\r\n  a ride.Â  \r\nFive\r\n  to ten minutes after Appellant called Travis, Latrice and her mother arrived at\r\n  the apartment.Â  At that time, Appellant asked Latrice why she kept sending her\r\n  family there to threaten him.Â  Latrice acted as if she did not know what he was\r\n  talking about.Â  After Latrice put her children to bed, she went over to her\r\n  mother's apartment.Â  Victim then arrived and asked where Latrice was.Â  After\r\n  Sammy told him she had gone to her mother's, Victim went into Paulette's\r\n  apartment.Â  Appellant testified he decided to go to Paulette's because when\r\n  Latrice first arrived she indicated she needed to talk to him and he had not\r\n  finished discussing the situation with her family with her.Â  Further, because\r\n  his ride had arrived, he wanted to lock up their apartment and needed to take\r\n  the keys to Latrice.\r\nAppellant\r\n  knocked on Paulette's door and Latrice let him into the apartment.Â  Latrice\r\n  walked into the kitchen, while Appellant stood between the kitchen and living\r\n  room trying to explain to Latrice what had been happening.Â  Appellant told\r\n  Latrice she needed to stop sending her family to threaten him.Â  Latrice acted\r\n  as if she did not know what was going on and had not said anything to her\r\n  family.Â  At some point, Victim stood up and said, &quot;Who are you talking\r\n  to?Â  Me?&quot;Â  Appellant described Victim as walking toward him in a &quot;rush&quot;\r\n  with his hand balled up and running toward him.Â  Appellant testified he was\r\n  much smaller than Victim and did not know if Victim possessed a weapon or was\r\n  going to try to fight him.Â  Appellant stated he was intimidated and feared he\r\n  was about to be hurt.Â  As Victim rushed toward him, Appellant pulled his gun\r\n  out and started shooting out of fear.Â  \r\nDuring\r\n  the State's presentation of evidence, the trial judge ruled various testimony\r\n  that the defense sought to elicit on cross-examination, including that discussed\r\n  in regard to Latrice, was inadmissible for various reasons including, but not\r\n  limited to, his determination the evidence was irrelevant, it was relevant but\r\n  the relevance was outweighed by other factors, and the proffered testimony\r\n  showed the witness denied knowledge. Â After the State rested, Appellant\r\n  proffered certain testimony of his sister, Alicia, seeking to introduce\r\n  evidence of Appellant's knowledge before the shooting that Victim had been\r\n  convicted of murdering his stepfather.Â  The judge granted the State's motion in\r\n  limine to exclude the conviction, based upon the fact that the violence\r\n  associated with the conviction was not directed toward the Appellant and it was\r\n  not closely connected in point of time or occasion, but noted his ruling was\r\n  preliminary and subject to change.[3]Â \r\n  The judge further sustained the State's relevancy objection to defense counsel's\r\n  question to Appellant's sister as to whether she knew that Keith owned or\r\n  possessed a gun.\r\nAt\r\n  the start of Appellant's testimony, the trial judge initially ruled evidence\r\n  concerning Appellant's interaction with Keith on the day of the shooting,\r\n  proffered to show Appellant's state of mind in regard to self-defense, was\r\n  inadmissible because the evidence at that point did not support a charge of self-defense.Â \r\n  However, after hearing Appellant's testimony and further argument of counsel,\r\n  the judge changed his mind and determined self-defense should be submitted to\r\n  the jury.Â  The judge further noted his reconsideration of the matter raised a\r\n  question of what additional evidence should be allowed.Â  The only evidence\r\n  pointed out by defense counsel at this juncture was evidence of the interaction\r\n  between Keith and Appellant, and evidence of Victim's prior conviction.Â  The\r\n  trial judge thereafter ruled evidence concerning Keith's actions toward Appellant\r\n  on that day was relevant and admissible.Â  He further ruled admissible evidence\r\n  of Victim's prior conviction.\r\nThereafter,\r\n  Appellant testified regarding a conversation he had with Victim in which Victim\r\n  stated he had been to jail, and &quot;whatever he went to jail for he used to\r\n  taste blood.&quot;Â  At certain times when Victim was around Appellant, Victim\r\n  would indicate he had committed the murder of his stepfather.Â  Appellant\r\n  further testified that on the evening of January 26, 2005, before Victim made\r\n  his first appearance at the apartment, Keith came over and asked Appellant what\r\n  happened between him and Latrice.Â  Appellant stated that Keith was upset,\r\n  wanting to know why Appellant hit Latrice in front of Keith and Latrice's\r\n  daughter.Â  During this time, Appellant observed that Keith held a gun in his\r\n  hand.Â  Keith indicated Antonia had been the source of his information regarding\r\n  Latrice's injury.Â  When Victim later came over and said the same thing to him,\r\n  and indicated the source of information was Antonia, Appellant began thinking\r\n  Victim and Keith had been in contact about the matter.Â  This made Appellant\r\n  scared, and he felt he needed to talk to Latrice so she could explain things to\r\n  her family.Â  Appellant maintained when he decided to go to Paulette's apartment\r\n  he did not believe he was walking into a violent situation, because he did not\r\n  think Victim would do anything in front of his aunt, Paulette.Â  However,\r\n  because he had been threatened repeatedly that day, when Victim rushed toward\r\n  him with his hands balled up, Appellant feared for his life and he started\r\n  shooting.Â  At the close of the evidence, upon the request of the defense, the\r\n  trial judge informed the jury he took judicial notice of the fact that Victim\r\n  had been convicted of second degree murder in North Carolina in 1989.\r\nAfter\r\n  closing arguments but prior to the court charging the jury, defense counsel\r\n  made a motion for mistrial arguing the trial judge's initial rulings that\r\n  excluded certain evidence relevant to his self-defense claim precluded him the\r\n  right to confront the State's witnesses and created a shift in burden.Â  The\r\n  trial judge asked counsel to point to specific instances, other than that of a\r\n  witness concerning whether she knew Appellant had knowledge of Victim's\r\n  conviction, where an objection was made during cross-examination resulting in\r\n  the defense being unable to present the evidence.Â  Counsel asserted &quot;Keith\r\n  Williams and his connection,&quot; the murder conviction of Victim, Latrice's\r\n  knowledge regarding Keith ever having a gun, and the showing of the gun to Appellant\r\n  on the night in question had also been excluded.Â Â  The trial judge found Appellant\r\n  had not been denied the right to confront Latrice, as she was present during\r\n  the entire trial and Appellant could have recalled her.Â  The judge inquired as\r\n  to whether Appellant would like to call Latrice and put her on the stand, but Appellant\r\n  declined.Â  The trial judge charged the law of self-defense to the jury.Â  The\r\n  jury ultimately returned guilty verdicts on both the murder and weapons\r\n  possession charge.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n&quot;Whether\r\n  the court denied appellant his right to confrontation and legitimate\r\n  cross-examination of state's witnesses about matters probative of self-defense\r\n  where the court prohibited cross-examination of State's witnesses until such\r\n  time as the court deemed there was evidence establishing all four elements of\r\n  self-defense, since this ruling was procedurally unfair, and it also was burden\r\n  shifting?&quot;\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  decision to grant or deny a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the\r\n  trial court and will not be overturned on appeal absent an abuse of discretion\r\n  amounting to an error of law.Â  State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 12, 515\r\n  S.E.2d 508, 514 (1999).Â  The power of a court to grant a mistrial ought to be\r\n  used with the greatest caution under urgent circumstances, and for very plain\r\n  and obvious causes stated into the record by the trial court.Â  State v.\r\n    Stanley, 365 S.C. 24, 34, 615 S.E.2d 455, 460 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  &quot;A\r\n  mistrial should only be granted when 'absolutely necessary,' and a defendant\r\n  must show both error and resulting prejudice in order to be entitled to a\r\n  mistrial.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;The granting of a motion for a mistrial is\r\n  an extreme measure which should be taken only where an incident is so grievous\r\n  that prejudicial effect can be removed in no other way.&quot;Â  Id.[4]Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellant contends he was denied his right\r\n  to confront witnesses against him when the trial judge ruled certain evidence\r\n  relevant to his self-defense claim inadmissible, finding the evidence was not a\r\n  legitimate area of cross-examination until all four elements of self-defense\r\n  were established.Â  He asserts this ruling was burden shifting, that Appellant\r\n  had the right to confront the witnesses during the State's case-in-chief, and\r\n  the ruling was arbitrary and unreasonable.Â  We find no reversible error.\r\n&quot;The\r\n  Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which was extended to the states\r\n  by the Fourteenth Amendment, guarantees the right of a criminal defendant to\r\n  confront witnesses against him, and this includes the right to cross-examine\r\n  witnesses.&quot;Â  State v. Holder, 382 S.C. 278, 283, 676 S.E.2d 690,\r\n  693 (2009).\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  right to present a defense is not unlimited, but must bow to accommodate other\r\n  legitimate interests in the criminal trial process.Â  The accused does not have\r\n  an unfettered right to offer [evidence] that is incompetent, privileged, or\r\n  otherwise inadmissible under standard rules of evidence. Â Defendants are\r\n  entitled to a fair opportunity to present a full and complete defense, but this\r\n  right does not supplant the rules of evidence and all proffered evidence or\r\n  testimony must comply with any applicable evidentiary rules prior to\r\n  admission.Â Â  \r\n\r\nState v. Lyles, 379 S.C. 328, 342-43, 665 S.E.2d\r\n  201, 209 (Ct. App. 2008) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).Â  Included\r\n  in the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confront his accusers is the right\r\n  to a meaningful cross-examination of an adverse witness, but this does not mean\r\n  the trial court conducting a criminal trial loses its usual discretion to limit\r\n  the scope of cross-examination.Â  State v. Turner, 373 S.C. 121, 130, 644\r\n  S.E.2d 693, 698 (2007). Â Rather, &quot;trial courts retain wide latitude,\r\n  insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned, to impose reasonable limits\r\n  on such cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things,\r\n  prejudice, confusion of the issues, or interrogation that is only marginally\r\n  relevant.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;[A]s to cross-examination specifically, the Confrontation\r\n  Clause 'guarantees only an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not\r\n  cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent,\r\n  the defense might wish.'&quot;Â  State v. Stokes, 381 S.C. 390, 401-02,\r\n  673 S.E.2d 434, 439 (2009), quoting United States v. Owens, 484 U.S.\r\n  554, 559 (1988).Â  In Stokes, the court held admission of extrinsic\r\n  evidence of a witness's prior inconsistent statement did not violate defendant's\r\n  Sixth Amendment right of confrontation at a murder trial, even though the\r\n  witness denied making the statement, where defendant had an opportunity to\r\n  cross-examine the witness given that the witness appeared at trial, was\r\n  available for cross-examination, could have been recalled after the extrinsic\r\n  evidence was admitted, and was not restricted in any way from testifying.Â  Id. at 398-403, 673 S.E.2d at 438-441.\r\nThe\r\n  only argument made by Appellant to the trial judge regarding the denial of his\r\n  right to confront the State's witnesses and a resulting shifting of the burden\r\n  was in his motion for mistrial.Â  There, the discussion of excluded evidence\r\n  centered around the testimony of Latrice, and Appellant pointed to the\r\n  following specific evidence as having been improperly excluded:Â  (1) evidence\r\n  the witness knew Appellant had knowledge of Victim's conviction; (2) &quot;Keith\r\n  Williams and his connection,&quot; (3) the murder conviction of Victim, (4)\r\n  Latrice's knowledge regarding Keith ever having a gun, and (5) the showing of\r\n  the gun to Appellant on the night in question.Â  On appeal, although Appellant\r\n  points to several rulings of the trial judge excluding evidence from Sammy,\r\n  Latrice and Alicia in his recitation of the facts, he only specifically argues\r\n  error in regard to the exclusion of evidence from Latrice.Â  Further, while Appellant\r\n  does also mention in his summary of excluded evidence that of Sammy regarding\r\n  whether the neighborhood was unsafe and whether it was common for people in the\r\n  area to carry guns, these matters clearly were not raised in Appellants motion\r\n  for mistrial.[5]Â \r\n  Thus, the only exclusion of evidence Appellant argues on appeal that is\r\n  preserved for review involves the testimony of Latrice.[6]Â \r\n  Though Appellant now asserts error in the exclusion of testimony from Latrice\r\n  regarding a confrontation between the boyfriend of Latrice's sister, Rocko, and\r\n  Victim when the boyfriend hit Latrice's sister, as well as testimony from\r\n  Latrice regarding her knowledge of Victim's prior murder charge, trial counsel\r\n  did not specifically point to the exclusion of the evidence from Latrice\r\n  regarding the confrontation between Rocko and Victim.Â  Thus, the only argument\r\n  preserved for review is the exclusion of Latrice's testimony regarding Victim's\r\n  prior conviction.\r\nAs\r\n  noted by the trial judge, Latrice's knowledge of Victim's murder conviction was\r\n  irrelevant, as it did not show Appellant's knowledge.Â  Accordingly, this\r\n  evidence would not be relevant to the issue of Appellant's self-defense. Â Therefore\r\n  the trial judge did not err in excluding it.Â  See Rule 401, SCRE (providing\r\n  evidence is relevant if it tends to make the existence of any fact that is of\r\n  consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable\r\n  than it would be without the evidence); State v. Stokes, 339 S.C. 154,\r\n  159, 528 S.E.2d 430, 432 (Ct. App. 2000) (stating evidence should be excluded\r\n  if it is calculated to arouse the sympathy or prejudice of the jury or is\r\n  irrelevant or unnecessary to substantiate the facts).Â  Additionally, the trial\r\n  judge took judicial notice of Victims prior conviction, and the jury was\r\n  therefore apprised of that conviction. Further, evidence of Appellant's\r\n  knowledge of Victim's prior conviction was admitted through Appellant's\r\n  testimony.Â  See State v. Mercer, 381 S.C. 149, 163, 672 S.E.2d\r\n  556, 563 (2009) (finding no prejudice from the exclusion of cumulative evidence).Â Â  \r\nEven\r\n  if we were to find trial counsel's general assertion of error in the exclusion\r\n  of Latrice's testimony sufficiently preserved Appellant's argument concerning\r\n  Latrice's proffered testimony in regard to the incident between Victim and\r\n  Rocko, we conclude the trial judge correctly found the testimony of Latrice\r\n  concerning the alleged incident between Victim and Rocko was inadmissible\r\n  because Latrice testified she did not remember the confrontation between Victim\r\n  and Rocko being discussed in front of Appellant.Â  The proffered testimony of\r\n  Latrice showed only that Appellant knew of the incident occurring between Rocko\r\n  and Jeanetta, and not that Appellant had knowledge of a confrontation between\r\n  Rocko and Victim.Â  Thus, this evidence likewise would not be relevant to\r\n  support Appellant's claim of self-defense.\r\nFinally,\r\n  we find no merit to Appellant's assertion that the exclusion of Latrice's\r\n  testimony in the State's case-in-chief violated her right to confrontation.Â  SeeÂ  Turner, 373 S.C. at 130, 644 S.E.2d at 698 (holding the trial courts\r\n  retain wide latitude, insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned, to\r\n  impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on concerns about,\r\n  among other things, prejudice, confusion of the issues, or interrogation that\r\n  is only marginally relevant); Stokes, 381 S.C. at 401-02, 673 S.E.2d at\r\n  439 (holding as to cross-examination specifically, the Confrontation Clause\r\n  guarantees only an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not\r\n  cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent,\r\n  the defense might wish).Â  Even if the excluded matters complained of by Appellant\r\n  were relevant such that admission would have been proper during\r\n  cross-examination, Appellant either elicited the evidence through other means\r\n  or was given the opportunity to present the evidence when the trial judge\r\n  changed his ruling and determined self-defense would be submitted to the jury.Â \r\n  Before Appellant had concluded the presentation of evidence, the trial judge\r\n  specifically asked what additional evidence the defense would like to present\r\n  based upon this reconsideration of self-defense, and counsel only pointed to\r\n  the incident between Keith and Appellant on the day of the shooting and\r\n  evidence concerning Victim's prior conviction.Â  The trial judge ruled both of\r\n  these admissible, and Appellant then presented evidence on both.Â  As noted by\r\n  the trial judge in his ruling on Appellant's motion for mistrial, Latrice\r\n  remained present throughout the trial and was available for Appellant to\r\n  recall, but he failed to take advantage of that opportunity.Â  Appellant cites\r\n  no law in support of his proposition that he was entitled to present this\r\n  evidence on cross-examination during the State's case-in-chief such that any\r\n  opportunity to subsequently recall the State's witness would be ineffective and\r\n  he was thereby denied his Sixth Amendment right of confronting witnesses\r\n  against him.Â  See Stokes, 381 S.C. at 398-403, 673 S.E.2d at\r\n  438-441 (wherein the court held admission of extrinsic evidence of a witness's\r\n  prior inconsistent statement did not violate defendant's Sixth Amendment right\r\n  of confrontation at a murder trial, even though the witness denied making the\r\n  statement, where defendant had an opportunity to cross-examine the witness\r\n  given that the witness appeared at trial, was available for cross-examination, could\r\n  have been recalled after the extrinsic evidence was admitted, and was not\r\n  restricted in any way from testifying).Â  Further, we are persuaded beyond a\r\n  reasonable doubt that, even if any violation of the Confrontation Clause occurred,\r\n  it was so insignificant that it did not affect the verdict and further find\r\n  that Appellant has failed to show he was unfairly prejudiced by any limitation\r\n  on cross-examination of Latrice.Â  See Turner, 373 S.C. at 131,\r\n  644 S.E.2d at 698 (noting it is reversible error if the defendant establishes\r\n  he was unfairly prejudiced by the limitation on cross-examination, and finding\r\n  no reversible error where the gist of the evidence Appellant desired was elicited\r\n  through other testimony); State v. Whaley, 290 S.C. 463, 465, 351 S.E.2d\r\n  340, 341 (1986) (recognizing a criminal defendant is entitled to a fair trial,\r\n  not a perfect one); see also Stanley, 365 S.C. at 34, 615\r\n  S.E.2d at 460 (holding a defendant must show both error and resulting prejudice\r\n  in order to be entitled to a mistrial).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nAs\r\n  to Appellant's assertion that the trial judge's rulings excluding evidence on\r\n  cross-examination somehow shifted the burden to him, he makes no argument and\r\n  cites no law in support of this proposition.Â  Accordingly, it is deemed\r\n  abandoned on appeal.Â  See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C.\r\n  361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (holding an issue is abandoned where the\r\n  appellant fails to provide argument or supporting authority); Wright v.\r\n    Craft, 372 S.C. 1, 20, 640 S.E.2d 486, 497 (Ct. App. 2006) (noting an issue\r\n  raised on appeal but not argued in the brief is deemed abandoned and will not\r\n  be considered by the appellate court); Mulherin-Howell v. Cobb, 362 S.C.\r\n  588, 600, 608 S.E.2d 587, 593-94 (Ct. App. 2005) (providing when an appellant\r\n  fails to cite any supporting authority for his position and makes conclusory\r\n  arguments, the appellant abandons the issue on appeal).\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we find no\r\n  error in the trial judge's denial of Appellant's motion for a mistrial.Â \r\n  Accordingly, his convictions are\r\nAFFIRMED.

Day, 341 S.C. 410, 419-20,\r\n  535 S.E.2d 431, 436 (2000); State v. Amburgey, 206 S.C. 426, 429, 34\r\n  S.E.2d 779, 780 (1945) (holding, in murder prosecution of one pleading\r\n  self-defense against an attack by deceased, evidence of other specific instances\r\n  of violence on deceased's part is inadmissible, unless the instances of\r\n  violence were directed against defendant or, if directed against others, were\r\n  so closely connected in point of time or occasion with the homicide as reasonably\r\n  to indicate deceased's state of mind at time of the homicide, or to produce\r\n  reasonable apprehension of great bodily harm).\r\n[4] Although Appellant does not specifically assert\r\n  the trial judge erred in denying his motion for mistrial, it is only in his\r\n  motion for mistrial that he raised the issue he now argues on appeal.Â  We\r\n  therefore find the proper standard of review to apply is that for a ruling on a\r\n  motion for mistrial.\r\n[5] It should further be noted the trial judge did not\r\n  exclude this evidence from Sammy on the basis that Appellant had not yet shown\r\n  the four elements of self-defense were present.Â  Rather, the trial judge\r\n  sustained the objection to the unsafe neighborhood question and why people\r\n  would carry guns finding only marginal relevance, and determined the relevance\r\n  was outweighed by the need to focus the issues and avoid confusing the jury\r\n  with extraneous matter.Â  See Rule 403, SCRE (&quot;Although relevant,\r\n  evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by\r\n  the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the\r\n  jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless\r\n  presentation of cumulative evidence.&quot;).Â  As to the testimony from\r\n  Sammy regarding whether it was common for people in that area to carry guns,\r\n  the trial judge sustained the State's relevancy objection without comment.Â  The\r\n  judge did not find that all the elements of self-defense would have to be shown\r\n  before this evidence became admissible.\r\n[6] Further, while Appellant mentions the exclusion of\r\n  certain evidence from Appellant's sister, Alicia, in his recitation of relevant\r\n  facts, he does not argue any error in the exclusion in his brief.Â  At any rate,\r\n  this testimony was not from a State's witness, but from Appellant's own\r\n  witness, and was not ruled inadmissible during cross-examination, but during\r\n  direct.Â  Thus, there would be no merit to any argument that this evidence was\r\n  wrongfully excluded cross-examination of a State's witness thereby denying\r\n  Appellant his right of confrontation.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-357","title":"State v.

Hudgins, of\r\n          Columbia, for Appellant. \r\n        J. Benjamin Aplin, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  James\r\n  E. Loftin appeals an order issued in 2008 that continued his probation and required\r\n  him to provide a DNA sample. Â He contends his probation terminated immediately\r\n  after he pled guilty in 2004 and paid a fine the following day.Â  We reverse.[1]\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn January 2004, Loftin was\r\n  indicted on one count of false swearing before persons authorized to administer\r\n  oaths.Â  On August 12, 2004, he pled guilty to the indictment.Â  He was sentenced\r\n  to two years imprisonment, suspended upon payment of a fine and two years'\r\n  probation.Â  The sentencing sheet further stated Loftin's probation would\r\n  terminate upon payment of the fine (PTUP).Â  Loftin paid the fine the following\r\n  day and was issued a receipt.Â  \r\nThe sentencing sheet had no\r\n  express requirement that Loftin provide a DNA sample.Â  It did, however, note\r\n  that probation was &quot;subject to South Carolina Department of Probation,\r\n  Parole and Pardon Services standard conditions of probation, which are\r\n  incorporated by reference.&quot;Â  The Standard Conditions of Probation to which\r\n  Loftin agreed also did not specifically require Loftin to provide a DNA sample.Â \r\n  Under condition number nine, Loftin agreed to &quot;obey all conditions of supervision\r\n  set forth in this order&quot;; however, the order included in the record did\r\n  not set forth any such conditions. Â Condition number ten required Loftin to\r\n  &quot;agree to comply with any further conditions imposed by the Department or\r\n  its Agents.&quot;Â  \r\nAccording to Loftin, about\r\n  eighteen months after he paid the fine, an agent approached him at his place of\r\n  employment, told him to &quot;give DNA,&quot; and made verbal threats.Â  Loftin\r\n  advised the agent he was appealing his conviction and had been advised by\r\n  counsel for the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon (the Department)\r\n  that his case &quot;did not fall under the DNA.&quot;[2]Â  On November 7, 2007, Loftin was served with a probation\r\n  citation charging him with violation of conditions nine and ten and certain\r\n  unspecified &quot;additional conditions.&quot;Â  The only fact cited in the\r\n  supporting affidavit was Loftin's alleged &quot;failure to submit for DNA testing\r\n  as required by SC State Law before the expected end date of the Probation case\r\n  on August 11, 2006.&quot;Â  \r\nA hearing in the matter was\r\n  scheduled for November 9, 2007, but was continued until January 11, 2008.Â \r\n  Loftin, appearing pro se, testified he was only recently informed\r\n  of the requirement that he provide a DNA sample.Â  After hearing arguments from\r\n  both Loftin and counsel for the Department, the presiding circuit judge ruled\r\n  from the bench: &quot;Standard conditions of probation which were incorporated\r\n  by reference and also as a part of that [sic] is the additional requirement of\r\n  the providing of a DNA sample and the fact that it was a PTUP case did not\r\n  eliminate the other requirements of probation . . . .&quot;Â  The same day, the\r\n  judge issued the appealed order requiring Loftin to report on January 31, 2008,\r\n  to give a DNA sample.[3]Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nThe sole issue on\r\n  appeal is whether, under the statutory law in effect in 2004, it was error to\r\n  continue Loftin's probation and order him to provide a DNA sample notwithstanding\r\n  that, according to the sentencing sheet, his probation was to have terminated\r\n  upon his payment of the fine imposed by the judge who accepted his guilty plea.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  interpretation of a statute is a question of law to be reviewed by this Court de\r\n  novo.Â  Town of Summerville v. City of N. Charleston, 378 S.C. 107, 110,\r\n  662 S.E.2d 40, 41 (2008).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nLoftin argues\r\n  that because he paid the court-imposed fine ordered by the sentencing judge\r\n  after he pled guilty and because the sentencing sheet noted his probation was\r\n  to terminate upon payment of the fine, the circuit court judge erred in\r\n  &quot;continuing&quot; his probation and in ordering him to provide a DNA sample.Â \r\n  We agree.\r\nSection 23-3-620 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (2007) requires certain offenders to provide DNA samples to law\r\n  enforcement.Â  The version of the statute in effect at the time of Loftin's\r\n  conviction provided in pertinent part as follows:\r\n\r\n  (A)&nbsp; Following sentencing and at the\r\n    time of intake at a jail or prison, a sample from which DNA may be obtained for\r\n    inclusion in the State DNA Database must be provided by:\r\n  (1) Any person convicted or\r\n    adjudicated delinquent and incarcerated in a state correctional facility\r\n    on or after July 1, 2004, for:\r\n  . . .\r\n  (b) any offense classified as a felony . . . or any\r\n    other offense that carries a maximum term of imprisonment of five years or\r\n    more; and\r\n  (2) any\r\n    criminal offender convicted or adjudicated delinquent on or after July 1, 2004,\r\n    who is ordered by the court to provide a sample.\r\n  (B) A\r\n    convicted offender who is required to provide a DNA sample under subsections\r\n    (A)(1) or (A)(2) but who is not sentenced to a term of confinement must provide\r\n    a sample as a condition of his sentence. . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-620\r\n  (2007) (emphasis added).[4]Â  Anyone required to provide a sample must also pay a\r\n  processing fee and, if the person required to provide the sample is not\r\n  sentenced to a term of confinement, &quot;payment of the fee must be a\r\n  condition of the person's sentence.&quot;Â  Id. Â§ 23-3-670 (2007 &amp;\r\n  Supp. 2009).\r\nLoftin's conviction was for\r\n  false swearing under oath, for which he could have been sentenced to five years'\r\n  imprisonment.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-9-30 (2003).Â  Nevertheless, although his\r\n  guilty plea was made after July 1, 2004, nothing in the record indicates he was\r\n  ever &quot;incarcerated in a state correctional facility.&quot; Â Furthermore, the\r\n  sentencing sheet does not include any provision requiring him to provide a DNA\r\n  sample.Â  Although condition number ten of the Standard Conditions required\r\n  compliance by Loftin with &quot;further conditions imposed by the Department or\r\n  its Agents,&quot; the first time the Department ever attempted to obtain a DNA\r\n  sample from Loftin was long after he had paid the fine imposed in conjunction\r\n  with his sentence.Â  Contrary to what the circuit court judge stated at the\r\n  revocation hearing, the list of Standard Conditions of Probation provided by\r\n  the Department does not include any requirement of providing a DNA sample.[5]\r\nSection 24-21-550 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code, enacted in 1993, provides as follows: \r\n\r\n  A\r\n    probation term ordered to end upon the payment of fines, court costs,\r\n    assessments, and restitution must continue until the clerk of court certifies\r\n    in writing that all monies have been paid, or the probation term has\r\n    expired, or the expiration of probation has been changed by a subsequent\r\n    order.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-550\r\n  (2007) (emphasis added).Â  Here, Loftin stated he received a written receipt\r\n  from the clerk of court acknowledging he paid his fine, and the Department\r\n  acknowledged it had a copy of the receipt in its file.Â  Although the Department\r\n  advised this Court that it has not closed its file on Loftin pending our\r\n  disposition of the present appeal, it has not provided any reason not to find\r\n  that, pursuant to statute, Loftin's probation term ended once he paid the\r\n  court-ordered fine.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn view of the fact that\r\n  Loftin paid his fine as ordered and the absence of any indication that Loftin\r\n  failed to abide by the court-imposed terms of his probation, we conclude that,\r\n  pursuant to section 24-21-550, Loftin's probation ended when he paid the fine\r\n  on August 13, 2004.Â  We therefore hold the circuit court judge should not have\r\n  granted the Department's requests to continue Loftin's probation and to order\r\n  him to provide a DNA sample.Â  Accordingly, the appealed order is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHUFF, THOMAS,\r\n  and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  In April 2007, Loftin's appeal was dismissed and his\r\n  attorney was relieved from representing him further in the matter.Â  State v.\r\n    Loftin, Op. No. 2007-UP-00152 (S.C. Ct. App. filed April 4, 2007).\r\n[3]Â  After Loftin filed his appeal, he moved to stay the\r\n  order requiring him to submit to DNA sampling.Â  On February 19, 2008, this\r\n  Court granted the stay upon Loftin's posting of a bond with the circuit court.\r\n[4]Â  The statute was rewritten in 2008 and the new\r\n  version became effective January 1, 2009.Â  The newest version provides for the\r\n  collection of DNA samples before conviction of a crime.Â  S.C. Code Ann.

Cliff Moore, and John D.\r\n          Hudson, Jr., all of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Max\r\n  E. Matthews, as co-personal representative of the estate of Tillman B. Matthews,\r\n  Sr. appeals the trial court's order dismissing his action against Ann J.\r\n  Matthews, South Carolina Bank and Trust (SCB&amp;T), First Citizens Bank, and\r\n  Charles J. Matthews (collectively Respondents).[1]Â \r\n  We affirm.[2]\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nTillman died testate on June\r\n  6, 2004 at the age of 94.Â  His will was admitted to informal probate in\r\n  Florence County on July 15, 2004.Â  In his will, Tillman appointed his sons from\r\n  a prior marriage, Max, Charles, and Tillman Jr.[3] as the corepresentatives of his estate. Â Charles submitted an inventory to the\r\n  probate court on February 3, 2005 verified only by himself because Max refused\r\n  to verify it.Â  \r\nIn September of 2005, Max\r\n  filed a petition in probate court asserting the inventory was false in that it\r\n  significantly understated the value of the estate and omitted items of personal\r\n  property and funds Max believed Tillman owned at the time of his death.Â  He\r\n  claimed Tillman's widow, Ann, had used a power of attorney while Tillman was\r\n  &quot;incapacitated, blind, and vulnerable&quot; to move funds into accounts in\r\n  her name and thus received funds from bank accounts that should have passed\r\n  under the residuary clause of the will.Â  He asserted Ann and others utilized\r\n  efforts to pay herself funds to which she was not entitled, including\r\n  certificates of deposit at SCB&amp;T.Â  He also claimed she and others entered\r\n  into Tillman's safe deposit box at First Citizens Bank after his death without\r\n  all personal representatives or a bank officer being present.Â  He asseverated\r\n  all of Ann's financial transactions with Tillman are null and void.Â  He alleged\r\n  she had been communicating with Charles about closing the estate quickly.Â  Max\r\n  also filed a petition to remove Charles as personal representative.\r\nMax, acting as corepresentative\r\n  of the estate of his father, subsequently brought the present action against\r\n  Ann, Charles, SCB&amp;T. and First Citizens Bank in the court of common pleas\r\n  for Richland County.Â  In his complaint, Max made similar allegations as he did in\r\n  his probate court petition.Â  He asserted causes of action against Ann and the\r\n  banks for breach of fiduciary duties in connection with the durable power of\r\n  attorney, influenced transactions prior to the power of attorney, conversion,\r\n  negligence per se, and violation of the Omnibus Adult Protection Act.Â  In\r\n  addition, he asserted a cause of action for conspiracy against all of the\r\n  defendants, constructive trust against Ann, and violation of the South Carolina\r\n  Unfair Trade Practices Act (SCUTPA) against the banks.Â  \r\nAll of the defendants\r\n  answered.Â  Ann, Charles, and First Citizens each filed motions to dismiss.Â \r\n  After a hearing, the trial court dismissed the case.Â  The court held it did not\r\n  have jurisdiction because the matters alleged in the complaint were directly\r\n  related to the administration of the estate and were in the original\r\n  jurisdiction of the Probate Court of Florence County.Â  Max filed a motion to\r\n  reconsider, which the court denied.Â  \r\nHe then timely appealed to\r\n  this court.Â  During the pendency of the appeal, a dispute arose regarding\r\n  whether the court's order, which referenced only Ann's motion to dismiss, applied\r\n  to just Ann or to all defendants.Â  This court granted Max's motion for a remand\r\n  to seek clarification of the order.Â  On remand, the trial court held the action\r\n  was dismissed as to all defendants.Â  Max served and filed a timely appeal of\r\n  this order.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;The question of subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction is a question of law for the court.&quot; Â Capital City\r\n    Ins. Co. v. BP Staff, Inc., 382 S.C. 92, 99, 674 S.E.2d 524, 528 (Ct. App.\r\n  2009).Â  Thus, when reviewing the trial court's grant of a motion to dismiss for\r\n  lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), SCRCP, this\r\n  court is free to decide questions of law with no deference to the trial court. Â Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1. Exclusive jurisdiction of\r\n  probate court\r\nMax argues the circuit court\r\n  erred in holding the probate court had exclusive jurisdiction over the action.Â \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Probate\r\n  Code confers exclusive original jurisdiction to the probate court over all\r\n  subject matter related to estates of decedents. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-302(a)(1)\r\n  (2009) (providing probate court has exclusive original jurisdiction over all\r\n  subject matter related to &quot;estates of decedents, including the contest of\r\n  wills, construction of wills, and determination of heirs and successors of\r\n  decedents and estates of protected persons&quot;).Â  An action requesting\r\n  settlement of a claim owed by and to an estate must be originated in the\r\n  probate court.Â  Anderson v. Anderson, 299 S.C. 110, 115, 382 S.E.2d 897,\r\n  900 (1989).Â  \r\nMax asserts the probate court\r\n  lacks subject matter jurisdiction over tort actions.Â  He claims:Â  &quot;Indeed,\r\n  if the decision of the lower court dismissing [his] Complaint is upheld, such\r\n  will set a new precedent requiring that all civil actions brought on behalf of\r\n  estates or beneficiaries, including actions for wrongful death, must be brought\r\n  first in the Probate Court.&quot;Â  The probate code specifically addresses the\r\n  circuit court's concurrent jurisdiction for wrongful death and survival\r\n  actions.[4]Â \r\n  In addition, while certain claims must originate in probate court, they may be\r\n  removed to circuit court pursuant to section 62-1-302(d), which provides in\r\n  part:\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding\r\n    the exclusive jurisdiction of the probate court over the foregoing matters, any\r\n    action or proceeding filed in the probate court and relating to the following\r\n    subject matters, on motion of a party, or by the court on its own motion, made\r\n    not later than ten days following the date on which all responsive pleadings\r\n    must be filed, must be removed to the circuit court and in these cases the\r\n    circuit court shall proceed upon the matter de novo:\r\n  .\r\n    . .\r\n  (5) actions in which a party has a right to trial by\r\n    jury and which involve an amount in controversy of at least five thousand\r\n    dollars in value. . . . \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-302(d)\r\n  (2009 &amp; Supp. 2009).Â  \r\nIn his response to Ann's and\r\n  Charles' motions to dismiss, Max acknowledged this section was applicable to\r\n  the present case even though he had originated his claim in circuit court\r\n  rather than filing it in probate court and seeking removal to circuit court\r\n  pursuant to the statute.Â  We find no merit to Max's assertion that the probate\r\n  court does not have jurisdiction over tort actions when those actions are related\r\n  to estates of decedents. Â See also Fulmer v. Cain, 380 S.C. 466,\r\n  471, 670 S.E.2d 652, 655 (2008) (Toal, C.J., concurring) (agreeing order\r\n  denying removal was not immediately appealable but noting appellant had an\r\n  absolute right to remove the case to circuit court for causes of action\r\n  including tortious interference with a contract and tortious interference with\r\n  inheritance rights); Mayer v. M.S. Bailey &amp; Son, 347 S.C. 353, 357-58,\r\n  555 S.E.2d 406, 408 (Ct. App. 2001) (noting action against bankers for breach\r\n  of contract, breach of contract accompanied by fraudulent act, breach of\r\n  fiduciary duty, and violation of the SCUTPA concerning administration of trust\r\n  filed in circuit court had been dismissed without prejudice for lack of\r\n  jurisdiction before it was brought in probate court).Â  \r\nMax brought the present\r\n  action on behalf of the estate.Â  His claims are based on Ann's alleged\r\n  transformation of probate assets into non-probate assets and removal of assets\r\n  from the estate after Tillman's death.Â  He sought a determination of assets\r\n  belonging to the estate, a return of the assets allegedly taken, and damages\r\n  arising from the alleged removal.Â  We hold these claims fall within the probate\r\n  court's exclusive original jurisdiction over all subject matter related to\r\n  estates of decedents.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in dismissing\r\n  Max's claims. \r\n2.Â  Max's lack of authority\r\n  to bring action as corepresentative\r\nThe Respondents contend as an\r\n  additional sustaining ground this court should find Max did not have the authority\r\n  to bring this action without the concurrence of his corepresentative, Charles.Â \r\n  The Probate Code provides: &quot;If two or more persons are appointed\r\n  corepresentatives and unless the will provides otherwise, the concurrence of\r\n  all is required on all acts connected with the administration and distribution\r\n  of the estate.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-717 (2009).Â  \r\nIn his reply brief, Max only\r\n  contends this issue is not properly before the court because it was not raised\r\n  to or ruled on by the trial court.Â  However, this court may affirm for any\r\n  reason appearing in the record.Â  Rule 220(c), SCACR (&quot;The appellate court\r\n  may affirm any ruling, order, decision or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing\r\n  in the Record on Appeal.&quot;); I'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mount Pleasant,\r\n  338 S.C. 406, 419, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000) (&quot;Under the present rules, a\r\n  respondent-the 'winner' in the lower court-may raise on appeal any additional\r\n  reasons the appellate court should affirm the lower court's ruling, regardless\r\n  of whether those reasons have been presented to or ruled on by the lower court.&quot;).Â \r\n  Accordingly, we hold we may consider this issue.Â  \r\nMax did not bring this action\r\n  individually but was solely acting as the corepresentative of the estate.Â  He\r\n  did not have the concurrence of Charles, his corepresentative, to bring the\r\n  action.Â  Thus, under section 62-3-717, he did not have the authority to bring\r\n  the action.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find no error in the trial\r\n  court's dismissal of Max's complaint.Â  Accordingly, the order of the trial court\r\n  is \r\nAFFIRMED.[5]\r\nHUFF,\r\n  THOMAS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Matthews family members are referred to by their first names.Â  \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3] Tillman Jr. passed away in September of 2004.\r\n[4] &quot;The court's jurisdiction over matters involving wrongful death or actions\r\n  under the survival statute is concurrent with that of the circuit court and\r\n  extends only to the approval of settlements . . . and to the allocation of\r\n  settlement proceeds among the parties involved in the estate.&quot;Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 62-1-302(b) (2009).\r\n[5] SCB&amp;T and First Citizens Bank assert the\r\n  appeal should be dismissed because Max failed to preserve the issue of the\r\n  identity of the parties to whom the trial court's original order applied by not\r\n  seeking clarification in his motion to alter or amend.Â  Max served all parties\r\n  with his notice of appeal of the trial court's December 2006 and January 2007\r\n  orders.Â  Thus, he timely appealed as to all parties.Â  Max does not dispute on\r\n  appeal the identity of the parties to whom the dismissal applied.Â  We find this\r\n  argument to be without merit.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-362","title":"State v.

Â Sanders argued the conviction would be an indication of McCrea's\r\n  ability to be truthful.[1] Â The court stated: &quot;That doesn't come [in] under the rules,&quot; and\r\n  after determining the maximum punishment for filing a false police report was\r\n  thirty days' imprisonment, the court ruled that because the punishment was less\r\n  than a year, &quot;[i]t wouldn't be admissible [even] if it happened\r\n  yesterday.&quot;Â  \r\nThe jury found Sanders guilty\r\n  only on the charge of CSC, and the trial court sentenced him to thirty years'\r\n  imprisonment.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  1. Did the trial court\r\n    err in excluding the victim's prior conviction for filing a false police\r\n    report?[2]\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n&quot;The admission or\r\n  exclusion of evidence is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the\r\n  trial court and its ruling will not be disturbed in the absence of a manifest\r\n  abuse of discretion accompanied by probable prejudice.&quot;Â  State v. Wise,\r\n  359 S.C. 14, 21, 596 S.E.2d 475, 478 (2004).Â  &quot;An abuse of discretion\r\n  occurs when the conclusions of the trial court either lack evidentiary support\r\n  or are controlled by an error of law.&quot;Â  State v. Pagan, 369 S.C.\r\n  201, 208, 631 S.E.2d 262, 265 (2006).Â  \r\nA witness's prior\r\n  conviction involving dishonesty or a false statement is admissible for\r\n  impeachment regardless of the punishment.Â  Rule 609(a)(2), SCRE; State v.\r\n    Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. 526, 544, 552 S.E.2d 300, 310 (2001). Â However, the\r\n  prior conviction is inadmissible if more than ten years have passed between the\r\n  conviction or release from confinement and the testimony, &quot;unless the court determines, in the interests of justice, that the probative value of\r\n  the conviction supported by specific facts and circumstances substantially\r\n  outweighs its prejudicial effect.&quot;Â  Rule 609(b), SCRE (emphasis added).Â  \r\nIn this case,\r\n  Sanders argued the conviction was an indication of the victim's ability to be\r\n  truthful and responsible; however, the trial court indicated that such a\r\n  conviction was not admissible under the rules.Â  The trial court ruled that\r\n  because the potential thirty day penalty for the offense was less than one\r\n  year, &quot;it wouldn't be admissible [even] if it happened yesterday.&quot;Â \r\n  However, Rule 609(a)(2), clearly states, &quot;evidence that any witness has\r\n  been convicted of a crime shall be admitted if it involved dishonesty or false\r\n  statement, regardless of the punishment.&quot; (emphasis added)Â \r\n  Accordingly, the trial court erred in ruling the conviction inadmissible because\r\n  it carried only a thirty day punishment.Â  Therefore, we find the trial court\r\n  abused its discretion, and in light of the limited physical evidence in this\r\n  case, such an error resulted in probable prejudice to Sanders.Â  See, e.g., Wise,\r\n  359 S.C. at 21, 596 S.E.2d at 478 (holding in order to warrant reversal, an\r\n  abuse of discretion must be accompanied by probable prejudice). \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  although we recognize the conviction is admittedly remote in time, such\r\n  convictions are not categorically inadmissible.Â  See Rule 609(b), SCRE\r\n  (stating remote convictions may be admitted if in the interest of justice the\r\n  trial court determines the probative value of the evidence outweighs its\r\n  prejudicial effect).Â  However, because the trial court focused on the potential\r\n  punishment being less than one year, it was never occasioned to determine if\r\n  the conviction fell within the exception provided by Rule 609(b).Â  \r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  ruling of the trial court is \r\nREVERSED and REMANDED for a new trial.Â  \r\nFEW, C.J.,\r\n  THOMAS, and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Sanders also maintained he was not responsible for\r\n  the two-year delay between the alleged assault and his arrest or the three-year\r\n  delay between his arrest and trial. \r\n[2]Â  We note Sanders also lists a second allegation of\r\n  error as whether the trial court erred in refusing to\r\n  instruct the jury on the issue of consent.Â  However, because our decision on\r\n  the aforementioned issue is dispositive we are not occasioned to address\r\n  Sanders' second allegation of error.Â  See Hughes v. State,\r\n  367 S.C. 389, 408-09, 626 S.E.2d 805, 815 (2006) (noting that an appellate\r\n  court need not reach remaining issues on appeal when a decision on another\r\n  issue is dispositive).Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-363","title":"State v.

(Mother) appeals the family court's final order terminating her\r\n  parental rights to her minor child (Child).Â  Mother contends the\r\n  family court erred in finding (1) Child was harmed by Mother and because of the\r\n  severity of abuse, it was not reasonably likely the home could be made safe;\r\n  (2) Mother failed to remedy the conditions that caused the removal of Child;\r\n  (3) Mother failed to visit Child; (4) Mother failed to support Child; (5)\r\n  Mother abandoned Child; and (6) termination of parental rights (TPR) was in\r\n  Child's best interests.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nThe grounds for TPR must be\r\n  proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Parker,\r\n  336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  &quot;Upon review, the\r\n  appellate court may make its own finding from the record as to whether clear\r\n  and convincing evidence supports the termination [of parental rights].&quot;Â  S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 609, 582 S.E.2d 419, 423\r\n  (2003).Â  However, despite our broad scope of review, we are not required to\r\n  disregard the findings of &quot;the family court, who saw and heard the\r\n  witnesses, [and] was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and\r\n  assign comparative weight to their testimony.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The family court may order TPR upon finding one or\r\n  more of eleven statutory grounds is satisfied and also finding TPR is in the\r\n  best interests of the child.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570 (2010).Â  \r\nWe find clear and\r\n  convincing evidence supports the family court's findings that Mother failed to remedy\r\n  the conditions that led to the removal of child.[2]Â \r\n  Â See Â§ 63-7-2570(2).Â  After DSS removed Child because Child tested\r\n  positive for cocaine at birth, Mother failed to enroll in a substance abuse program,\r\n  take parenting classes, or attempt to complete any other part of her\r\n  court-ordered treatment plan.Â  Instead, in the six-month period after Child's\r\n  removal, Mother, by her own admission, continued to take drugs and engage in\r\n  criminal behavior before she was convicted and imprisoned for third-degree burglary.Â \r\n  Although it is commendable that Mother was making efforts to address her\r\n  problems while imprisoned by applying for enrollment in substance abuse and\r\n  parenting classes, she did not remedy the conditions that led to removal of\r\n  Child.Â  See Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Pritchett, 296 S.C.\r\n  517, 520, 374 S.E.2d 500, 501 (Ct. App. 1988) (&quot;[A]n attempt to\r\n  remedy alone is [inadequate] to preserve parental rights.Â  Otherwise, the\r\n  statute would be couched in such terms. The attempt must have, in fact,\r\n  remedied the conditions.&quot;). Accordingly, the family court correctly found\r\n  sufficient statutory grounds for TPR.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nIn a TPR case, the best\r\n  interests of the child are the paramount consideration.Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc.\r\n    Servs. v. Smith, 343 S.C. 129, 133, 538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct. App. 2000).Â \r\n  &quot;The interests of the child shall prevail if the\r\n  child's interest and the parental rights conflict.&quot; Â S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 63-7-2620 (2010).Â  \r\nWe find clear and convincing\r\n  evidence in the record supports the family court's finding termination of\r\n  Mother's parental rights was in Child's best interests. Mother has a history of\r\n  abusing drugs and criminal behavior stemming from her drug addiction.Â \r\n  Additionally, Mother has no relationship with Child and does not have a\r\n  familial network to support her if Child is returned to her care.Â  In contrast,\r\n  Child's current foster care family is providing a stable and loving environment\r\n  for Child, and both Child's foster care worker and the guardian ad litem stated\r\n  Child was well-adjusted and was bonded with the foster care family.Â \r\n  Additionally, Child's foster care family expressed interest in adopting Child,\r\n  and terminating Mother's parental rights would allow the adoption process to\r\n  proceed.Â  See Doe v. Roe, 386 S.C. 624, 634, 690 S.E.2d 573, 579\r\n  (2010) (&quot;Overturning the family court's decision to terminate [parent's] rights\r\n  clearly conflicts with the TPR statute's purpose to make a child eligible for\r\n  adoption by someone 'who will provide a suitable home environment and the love\r\n  and care necessary for a happy, healthful, and productive life.'&quot; (quoting\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2510 (2010))).Â  Accordingly, the family court correctly\r\n  determined TPR was in Child's best interests.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  KONDUROS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Because we find Mother failed to remedy the\r\n  conditions that led to the removal of Child, we need not address the remaining\r\n  statutory grounds for TPR.Â  See Stinecipher v.

Haller, of Charleston, for\r\n          Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Fenwick\r\n  Properties appeals the trial court's order granting partial summary judgment to\r\n  Island Preservation Company and Thomas Dewey Wise (collectively Island\r\n  Preservation), in which the court upheld a 1984 order declaring Island\r\n  Preservation's predecessor-in-title fee simple owner of marshland (Marsh\r\n  Property) due to a King's Grant.Â  We find Fenwick Properties is not a party\r\n  aggrieved by this order and dismiss.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nIn the fall of 1983, Dewey\r\n  Wise contracted to purchase several hundred acres of land on South Fenwick\r\n  Island.Â  For tax purposes, he asked his law partner at the time, W. Gregory\r\n  Pearce, to act as his agent in the transaction.Â  At the closing on the\r\n  property, title was placed in Pearce's name, even though Wise provided all of\r\n  the funds for the purchase price.Â  A declaratory judgment action was brought in\r\n  Pearce's name against the State of South Carolina requesting a declaration\r\n  Pearce was the owner in fee simple to the mean low water mark by virtue of a\r\n  King's Grant. Â Before the court issued its ruling in the declaratory judgment\r\n  action, Pearce conveyed the property to Wise.Â  Neither Pearce nor Wise moved to\r\n  amend the complaint in the action to substitute Wise as a party.Â  In October of\r\n  1984, the court issued an order ruling the property line extended to the low\r\n  water mark.Â  This order was not appealed.Â  Wise subsequently transferred the\r\n  property to Island Preservation Company, of which he is the general partner. Â When\r\n  questions arose concerning the King's Grant in 2005, Pearce executed a quit\r\n  claim deed for the Marsh Property within the King's Grant.Â  \r\nIn April of 2006, Island\r\n  Preservation brought the present declaratory judgment action against the State\r\n  seeking a declaration the October 1984 order was valid.Â  In its second amended\r\n  complaint, it named as Defendants both the State and the South Carolina\r\n  Department of Natural Resources (DNR), which by way of a 2005 deed from the\r\n  Nature Conservatory may have a competing claim to a portion of the Marsh\r\n  Property.Â  In addition to requesting a declaration concerning the validity of\r\n  the 1984 order, it asked for a declaration that its title was superior to any\r\n  competing claim.Â  In the alternative, it requested the court find it possessed\r\n  fee simple title to the tidelands between the high water mark and low water\r\n  mark as it can trace its title to King George II of England.Â  In their answer,\r\n  the State and DNR asserted the 1984 order was not valid because the named\r\n  plaintiff, Gregory Pearce, had conveyed the property prior to the issuance of\r\n  the order.Â  They also asked for a declaration DNR's 2005 deed prevailed over any\r\n  claim Island Preservation had to the overlapping property and for an\r\n  adjudication of the boundaries between DNR and Island Preservation's\r\n  properties.Â  \r\nFenwick Properties moved to\r\n  intervene in the proceedings, claiming an interest due to its ownership of\r\n  property on South Fenwick Island, possession of an easement over Island\r\n  Preservation's property, and being the holder of a dock permit over the\r\n  disputed marsh.Â  The trial court granted the motion to intervene.Â  It\r\n  subsequently granted Island Preservation's motion for partial summary\r\n  judgment.Â  It held Pearce was a real party in interest in the 1984 litigation,\r\n  and thus, the 1984 order was valid.Â  The court stated the remaining issues\r\n  between the parties would be litigated later.Â  \r\nAll of the defendants moved\r\n  for reconsideration of the order.Â  In the substituted order, the court again\r\n  found the 1984 order to be valid.Â  It noted:Â  &quot;Fenwick Properties, which\r\n  seeks to have an easement at the location interpreted, has no claim to fee\r\n  simple title to the tidelands.Â  The arguments offered by Fenwick Properties\r\n  concern the validity of the grant; it has not questioned the validity of the\r\n  1984 order.&quot;Â  It reiterated the remaining issues not covered in the order\r\n  granting summary judgment could still be litigated, &quot;specifically the\r\n  State's claims relating to its 2005 deed to the marshes of Pine Island and the\r\n  claims of Fenwick Properties.&quot;Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIsland Preservation argues\r\n  Fenwick Properties does not have the right to appeal the trial court's order as\r\n  it is not a party aggrieved by the order.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Appellate\r\n  Court Rules limit the ability to appeal to â€œ[o]nly a party aggrieved by an order,\r\n  judgment . . . or decision. . . .â€ Â Rule 201(b), SCACR.Â  As used by this rule,\r\n  the word &quot;aggrieved&quot; means &quot;a substantial grievance, a denial of\r\n  some personal or property right, or the imposition on a party of a burden or\r\n  obligation.â€ Â Powell ex rel. Kelley v. Bank of Am., 379 S.C. 437, 447,\r\n  665 S.E.2d 237, 243 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  â€œA party is aggrieved by a judgment or\r\n  decree when it operates on his or her rights of property or bears directly on\r\n  his or her interest.â€ Id.Â  &quot;There is no material distinction in\r\n  general standing principles juxtaposed to the ability of an 'aggrieved party'\r\n  to appeal pursuant to Rule 201(b).&quot;Â  Id. at 447, 665 S.E.2d at\r\n  242.Â  \r\nStanding concerns whether a\r\n  party has â€œsufficient interest in the outcome of the litigation to warrant\r\n  consideration of that party's position by a court.Â  Powell, 379 S.C. at\r\n  444, 665 S.E.2d 237 at 241. Â Generally, to have standing, a party must have a\r\n  personal stake in the subject matter of the litigation.Â  Michael P. v.\r\n    Greenville Dep't of Soc. Servs., 385 S.C. 407, 415-16, 684 S.E.2d 211, 215\r\n  (Ct. App. 2009).\r\n\r\n  Standing\r\n    is comprised of three elements: (1) the plaintiff must have suffered an\r\n    injury-in-fact that is concrete and particularized, and actual and imminent as\r\n    opposed to hypothetical; (2) the injury and the conduct complained of the\r\n    defendant must be causally connected; and (3) it must be likely that the injury\r\n    will be redressed by a favorable decision.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 416, 684 S.E.2d at 215.\r\nFenwick Properties contends\r\n  it has standing because enforcing the 1984 order against it is a violation of\r\n  its due process rights.Â  See S.C. Coastal Conservation League v. S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 380 S.C. 349, 669 S.E.2d 899 (2008)\r\n  (stating procedural due process requires notice, an opportunity to be heard,\r\n  and meaningful judicial review to an individual whose property or liberty\r\n  interests would be affected).Â  Fenwick Properties does not claim a fee simple\r\n  interest in the Marsh Property.Â  Instead, it asserts that as the holder of an\r\n  easement, it cannot be bound by the 1984 order because its predecessor-in-title\r\n  was not named as a party in the 1984 litigation.Â  However, the 1984 action\r\n  simply determined Island Preservation's predecessor-in-title possessed a King's\r\n  Grant of the Marsh Property.Â  It did not adversely affect any easement interest\r\n  over what is now Island Preservation's property.Â  It was therefore unnecessary\r\n  for Pearce to name Fenwick Properties' predecessor-in-title as a party\r\n  defendant.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-67-70 (2005) (&quot;Any judgment\r\n  entered in an action to try adverse claims shall be binding upon all of\r\n  the defendants joined in the action.&quot;) (emphasis added).Â  Island\r\n  Preservation acknowledged the existence of an easement from and to the property\r\n  known as the Landing in a 1996 Mutual Release and Settlement Agreement.Â  The\r\n  present action only upholds the validity of the 1984 order and does not in any\r\n  way limit Fenwick Properties' easement.Â  Thus, Fenwick Properties' due process\r\n  rights were not violated.Â  \r\nFenwick Properties also\r\n  asserts it has standing in this appeal because the trial court's order\r\n  adversely impacts its right to construct a dock on the Marsh Property.Â  In\r\n  February of 2005, the Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC),\r\n  Bureau of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM), issued Fenwick\r\n  Properties a dock permit authorizing it to construct a dock on Island\r\n  Preservation's property.Â  Island Preservation appealed the permit to the\r\n  Administrative Law Court, which stayed the appeal pending the resolution of the\r\n  present action, stating the issue of ownership of the marsh was\r\n  &quot;paramount.&quot;Â  \r\nAlthough Fenwick Properties does\r\n  not state why the issue of title is so important to its dock permit, Island\r\n  Preservation explains Fenwick Properties will need its permission before it can\r\n  build a dock across the Marsh Property if Island Preservation is the fee simple\r\n  owner.Â  See 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-2 (I) (Supp. 2009) (requiring a\r\n  deed, lease, or other instrument from the critical area landowner that would\r\n  allow construction of the proposed project, or written permission from such\r\n  owner); Lowcountry Open Land Trust v. State, 347 S.C. 96, 111, 552\r\n  S.E.2d 778, 786 (Ct. App. 2001) (&quot;[I]f ownership vests in private hands,\r\n  an adjacent landowner desiring to build on tidelands must obtain the express\r\n  consent of the fee simple owner.&quot;)Â  \r\nThe supreme court and this\r\n  court have both recognized that a party does not necessarily have standing in\r\n  one action merely because that action may affect its interest in another\r\n  action.Â  See e.g., Ex Parte Gov't Employee's Ins. Co., 373 S.C.\r\n  132, 644 S.E.2d 699 (2007); Powell.Â  In Ex Parte Government\r\n    Employee's Insurance Company, Ronnie Cooper claimed he was entitled to\r\n  stack underinsured motorist coverage provided by Government Employee's Insurance\r\n  Company (GEICO) to Yolanda Goethe, whom he claimed was his common-law wife.Â  373\r\n  S.C. at 134, 644 S.E.2d at 700.Â  Cooper filed an action in family court seeking\r\n  an order validating his common marriage to Goethe.Â  Id.Â  GEICO moved for\r\n  joinder and to intervene in the family court action.Â  Id.\r\nThe supreme court affirmed\r\n  the family court's denial of the motions.Â  Id. at 139, 644 S.E.2d at\r\n  703.Â  The court recognized the existence of a common law marriage may have\r\n  impacted GEICO's liability to Cooper and thus GEICO may have been affected by\r\n  the outcome of the family court action.Â  Id. at 136, 644 S.E.2d at 701.Â \r\n  However, it found GEICO's interest was in the financial implications of the\r\n  family court's decision, which was &quot;merely tangential&quot; and\r\n  &quot;peripheral&quot; to the family court action.Â  Ex Parte Gov't\r\n    Employee's Ins. Co., 373 S.C. at 136-39, 644 S.E.2d at 701-02.Â  It held\r\n  this interest was insufficient to warrant GEICO's intervention in the family\r\n  court action.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nIn Powell, a minor\r\n  brought an action through his conservator and his mother against his aunt\r\n  seeking the return of life insurance proceeds his aunt had converted.Â  379 S.C.\r\n  at 442, 665 S.E.2d at 240.Â  The minor also named as a defendant Bank of\r\n  America, where the aunt had deposited the funds in her own account and purchased\r\n  certificates of deposit rather than placing the funds in a restricted account\r\n  as ordered by the probate court.Â  Id. at 441-42, 665 S.E.2d at 239-40.Â  The\r\n  minor's mother, who had previously sued the aunt for conversion of the funds\r\n  and had received a judgment against her, moved to intervene and for\r\n  interpleader of funds from the aunt which had been deposited with the clerk of\r\n  court.Â  Id. at 441-42, 665 S.E.2d at 240.Â  After a contested hearing,\r\n  the trial court apportioned the funds between the minor and his mother. Â Id.\r\n  at 443, 665 S.E.2d at 240.Â  This court dismissed Bank of America's appeal of\r\n  this order holding the bank had no interest in the subject matter of the\r\n  apportionment of the escrowed funds.Â  Id. at 443, 665 S.E.2d at 241.Â  We\r\n  rejected Bank of America's argument it had standing because if all of the\r\n  interpleaded funds were allocated to the minor, the minor's damages would be\r\n  reduced, and thus, Bank of America's potential liability would be reduced.Â  Powell,\r\n  at 445, 665 S.E.2d at 241.Â  The court notedÂ  &quot;Not every practical concern\r\n  equates to the legal interest required for standing.&quot;Â  Id. at 445,\r\n  665 S.E.2d at 241.Â  We found Bank of America's interest in maximizing the\r\n  minor's share of the interpleaded funds was speculative and contingent.Â  Id.\r\nThe order on appeal concerns\r\n  only the validity of the 1984 order issued in an action in which Fenwick\r\n  Properties was not a party.Â  The order in no way limits or otherwise affects\r\n  Fenwick Properties' easement over Island Preservation's property.Â  Fenwick\r\n  Properties' interest in the administrative action of whether it would have to\r\n  obtain Island Preservation's permission to build its dock is &quot;merely\r\n  tangential&quot; and &quot;peripheral&quot; to the present appeal. Â Accordingly,\r\n  we find Fenwick Properties is not a party aggrieved by the order and dismiss\r\n  the appeal.Â  \r\nDISMISSED.[1]\r\nHUFF, THOMAS, and LOCKEMY,\r\n  JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Fenwick Properties argues the trial court should have\r\n  denied summary judgment because Island Preservation had failed to respond to\r\n  any of Fenwick Properties' discovery requests.Â  The trial court did not rule on\r\n  this issue in its original order and Fenwick Properties failed to request a\r\n  ruling in its motion to alter or amend.Â  Accordingly, this argument is not\r\n  properly before this court.Â  See I'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant,\r\n  338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000) (&quot;If the losing party has\r\n  raised an issue in the lower court, but the court fails to rule upon it, the\r\n  party must file a motion to alter or amend the judgment in order to preserve\r\n  the issue for appellate review.&quot;). \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-370","title":"State v.

Arial, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Jerry L. Rosemond appeals his conviction\r\n  for strong arm robbery, arguing the trial court erred in admitting hearsay\r\n  testimony regarding his identity into evidence.Â  We affirm.[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nAt\r\n  trial, a police officer who participated in the search for the robber stated an\r\n  elderly woman at the residence where the robbery occurred identified Rosemond\r\n  as the man who matched the description of the robber.Â  Rosemond contends this\r\n  statement constitutes inadmissible hearsay.Â  The State argues the statement was\r\n  not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but was offered to explain\r\n  how the police officer was conducting her investigation.Â  However, even\r\n  assuming the statement was hearsay, its admission by the trial court was\r\n  harmless.Â  See State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 288, 625 S.E.2d 641,\r\n  646 (2006) (&quot;The improper admission of hearsay is reversible error only\r\n  when the admission causes prejudice.&quot;).Â  The admission of the hearsay\r\n  statement in this case was harmless because it was cumulative to other similar\r\n  testimony offered without objection.Â  See State v. Good, 308 S.C.\r\n  308, 311, 417 S.E.2d 640, 642 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  Here, the first police officer\r\n  testified she believed her conversation with the elderly woman was included in\r\n  the report on the robbery. Additionally, a second police officer testified,\r\n  without objection, that he received a report in which Rosemond was identified\r\n  as the primary suspect in the robbery.Â  Moreover, the admission of the statement\r\n  was harmless because it could not have reasonably affected the outcome of the trial.Â  See State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985).Â \r\n  There was ample evidence from which the jury could have found Rosemond guilty.Â \r\n  The victim identified Rosemond without hesitation in the photographic lineup\r\n  and at trial.Â  Further, the second police officer testified Rosemond's voice\r\n  matched a description of the robber's voice, and Rosemond lived at the\r\n  residence where the robbery occurred.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not\r\n  commit reversible error in admitting the hearsay statement.

(Mother) appeals from the family\r\n  court's order terminating parental rights to her four minor children (Children).Â \r\n  Mother contends the family court erred in finding termination of parental\r\n  rights (TPR) was in Children's best interests.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in\r\n  part, and remand.[1]Â  \r\nThe\r\n  grounds for TPR must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Dep't\r\n    of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  &quot;Upon review, the appellate court may make its own finding from the\r\n  record as to whether clear and convincing evidence supports the termination [of\r\n  parental rights].&quot;Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C.\r\n  602, 609, 582 S.E.2d 419, 423 (2003).Â  The\r\n  family court may order TPR upon finding one or more of the eleven statutory\r\n  grounds is satisfied and also finding TPR is in the best interest of the\r\n  child.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570 (2010).Â  In a TPR case, the best interests\r\n  of the child are the paramount consideration.Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v.\r\n    Smith, 343 S.C. 129, 133, 538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  &quot;The interests of the child shall prevail if the child's\r\n  interest and the parental rights conflict.&quot; Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2620 (2010). Â Â \r\nWe\r\n  agree with the family court's findings that the statutory grounds for\r\n  termination of Mother's parental rights were satisfied.Â  However, regarding the best interests of\r\n  Children, we find the record is insufficient to determine whether termination\r\n  of Mother's parental rights was in Children's best interests.Â  At the TPR hearing, the South Carolina Department of\r\n  Social Services (DSS) foster care case manager summarily testified TPR was in\r\n  the best interests of Children.Â  DSS did not present any testimony regarding\r\n  how Children were adjusting to their current foster care placements or\r\n  Children's future prospects for permanent placement.Â  Additionally, the\r\n  guardian ad litem did not believe TPR was in Children's best interests, and\r\n  both the DSS foster care case manager and the guardian ad litem testified\r\n  Children were strongly bonded with Mother and did not want Mother's parental\r\n  rights terminated.Â  Furthermore, in its order, the family court did not provide\r\n  any factual evidence in support of its finding TPR was in the best interests of\r\n  Children as required by Rule 26, SCRFC.Â  See Rule\r\n  26(a), SCRFC (&quot;An order or judgment pursuant to an adjudication in a\r\n  domestic relations case shall set forth the specific findings of fact and\r\n  conclusions of law to support the [family] court's decision.&quot;).Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we affirm the family court's order as to its findings on the statutory grounds\r\n  for TPR, reverse the family court's order as to its findings on best interests,\r\n  and remand the matter in order for the family court to make sufficient findings\r\n  of fact as to whether TPR is in the best interests of Children.Â  The family\r\n  court may order a hearing on best interests to further clarify the issues\r\n  surrounding Children's current foster care placements, Children's future prospects\r\n  for permanent placement, and any other relevant issues related to Children's\r\n  best interests.Â  Â Â Â \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nWILLIAMS, KONDUROS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-377","title":"Cauble v.

Bailey, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â This\r\n  is an appeal of a divorce decree.Â  Winston Reid Cauble (Husband) alleges the\r\n  family court erred in (1) awarding Rae Ann Valentine Cauble (Wife) an equitable\r\n  interest in the proceeds obtained from the sale of a home that Husband\r\n  inherited from his mother, (2) awarding Wife an equitable interest in a portion\r\n  of a business allegedly owned by a third party, (3) requiring Husband to pay\r\n  one-half of the expenses incurred by Wife in hiring an accountant for this\r\n  lawsuit, and (4) refusing to give Husband credit for funds he claimed to have\r\n  paid for Wife and the parties' minor child while this matter was pending.Â  We\r\n  affirm.[1]\r\nThe\r\n  parties married in 1980 and separated in December 2005.Â  They have one son, who\r\n  was born in 1989.Â  During the marriage, they acquired ownership interests in\r\n  two businesses.Â  The first business, W&amp;A Associates, was a mobile home\r\n  dealership that, as of the time this lawsuit was filed, was in Wife's name.Â  After\r\n  the parties separated but before this action was filed, Husband had Wife place funds\r\n  from the sale of his deceased mother's home into a bank account that was in the\r\n  name of W&amp;A Associates.Â  The other business, M&amp;R Development, was a\r\n  corporation dealing in modular homes and land sales.Â  Husband purportedly owned\r\n  fifty-one percent of the stock of M&amp;R Development, and a third party,\r\n  Marcus Tanner, was reflected on corporate records as the owner of the remaining\r\n  forty-nine percent.Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  this action was pending in the family court, Husband continued to pay his own\r\n  bills and numerous expenses for the parties' child, including private school\r\n  tuition and contributions to a capital campaign building fund, from business\r\n  accounts.Â  Also during that time, Husband made payments on Wife's vehicle and,\r\n  according to him, paid $22,000 from an account owned by M&amp;R Development to\r\n  settle a lawsuit.\r\nIn the\r\n  final decree, the family court granted the parties a divorce on the ground of a\r\n  one-year separation.Â  The court found it did not need to resolve any issues\r\n  regarding the parties' child, who was nearly eighteen and would be graduating\r\n  from high school.Â  The court noted (1) the child lived primarily with Wife and\r\n  visited Husband on a regular basis and (2) Husband agreed to continue paying\r\n  for the child's health and automobile insurance.Â  As to the marital property,\r\n  the court found the parties were entitled to a fifty-fifty division.Â  To effect\r\n  the distribution, the court identified various marital assets, which it awarded\r\n  to Wife, including a cash payment of $132,277.Â  The family court also ordered\r\n  Husband to pay half of the fee charged by a forensic accountant hired by Wife\r\n  for the case.Â  Pursuant to Husband's motion to alter or amend, the family court\r\n  made minor corrections to the decree and added language for purposes of\r\n  clarification, but denied further relief to Husband.Â  Husband then filed this\r\n  appeal.\r\n1.&nbsp; Husband first claims\r\n  the family court erred in awarding Wife fifty percent of the proceeds from the\r\n  sale of the home that he inherited from his mother, noting (1) the home was\r\n  titled solely in his name from the time he inherited it, which preceded the\r\n  birth of the parties' child, and (2) there was no debt service associated with\r\n  the home during the parties' marriage, and (3) the funds remained traceable.Â  We\r\n  find no error.\r\nHusband is correct that inherited property\r\n  is nonmarital.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-630(A)(1) (Supp. 2009).Â  We also agree\r\n  with him that the proceeds from the sale of his mother's home are likewise\r\n  prima facie nonmarital because they constitute &quot;property acquired . . . in\r\n  exchange for [inherited property].&quot;Â  Id. Â§ 20-3-630(A)(3).Â  The family court, however, placed great emphasis on\r\n  the fact that instead of putting the sales proceeds into an account in his own\r\n  name, Husband had Wife place the funds into a bank account that was in the name\r\n  of W&amp;A, a corporation in which she was the sole record owner.Â  The court\r\n  likewise found that &quot;by doing this, the Husband made this marital property\r\n  and . . . should not be given additional credit.&quot; Â The court further found\r\n  Husband took these steps to obtain a tax advantage and concluded that\r\n  &quot;[i]f it should be honored by the IRS, it should likewise be recognized by\r\n  this Court.&quot;Â  Husband does not challenge this reasoning in his brief.Â  Moreover,\r\n  even the absence of any commingling is not dispositive of the question of\r\n  whether a nonmarital asset has been transmuted into marital property.Â  See Peterkin v. Peterkin, 293 S.C. 311, 312, 360 S.E.2d 311, 312 (1987)\r\n  (recognizing that property inherited by a spouse may become transmuted into\r\n  marital property); Hussey v. Hussey, 280 S.C. 418, 423, 312 S.E.2d 267,\r\n  270-71 (Ct. App. 1984) (stating the nonmarital character of inherited property\r\n  may be lost and the property may become subject to equitable division\r\n  &quot;when the property becomes so commingled as to be untraceable; is utilized\r\n  by the parties in support of the marriage; or is titled jointly or otherwise utilized in such manner as to evidence an intent by the parties to\r\n  make it marital property&quot;) (emphasis added).\r\n2.&nbsp; The family court found\r\n  the bank accounts in the name of M&amp;R Development were marital property and\r\n  divided them equally between Husband and Wife.Â  In contrast, the court found half\r\n  of the real estate belonging to M&amp;R Development was actually owned by Marcus\r\n  Tanner.Â  Husband takes issue with the inclusion of the bank accounts in the\r\n  marital estate, arguing the family court should not have divided them between\r\n  the parties without making Tanner a party to the action.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Sexton v. Sexton, 298 S.C. 359,\r\n  361-62, 380 S.E.2d 832, 834 (1989), the South Carolina Supreme Court held that\r\n  &quot;when property is alleged to be marital property, but is owned by a third\r\n  party, the Family Court has the subject matter jurisdiction to join all persons\r\n  with a possible interest in the property as parties to the action and to\r\n  determine if the property constitutes marital property as defined inÂ  Â§\r\n  20-7-473 [now Â§ 20-3-630].&quot;Â  Here, however, Tanner's ownership interest in\r\n  the business was not immediately apparent.Â  First, the tax returns of M&amp;R\r\n  Development, which were proffered by Wife, showed Husband owned one hundred\r\n  percent of the stock of the corporation.Â  Furthermore, during discovery, Husband\r\n  failed to produce the corporate records supporting his assertion about Tanner's\r\n  ownership interest; rather, he offered them over Wife's objection when the\r\n  trial was already underway.Â  In addition, Husband does not take issue with the\r\n  family court's finding that he transferred money back and forth between\r\n  accounts held by both family businesses as well as his personal accounts, essentially\r\n  treating the business as solely his own.Â  Finally, Husband himself could have moved\r\n  to make Tanner a party to the action or called him as a witness, but never\r\n  attempted to do either of these.Â  Under these circumstances, we are reluctant to disturb the family\r\n  court's decision to treat the accounts of M&amp;R Development as marital\r\n  property.Â  See Shearer v. DeShon, 240 S.C. 472, 484, 126 S.E.2d\r\n  514, 520 (1962) (&quot;Ordinarily, one cannot complain of an error which his\r\n  own conduct has induced.&quot;).\r\n3.&nbsp; The family court\r\n  declined to award attorney's fees to either party; however, it ordered Husband\r\n  to pay one-half of the fees Wife incurred for the services of a forensic\r\n  accountant whom she had hired for this action.Â  Husband argues this directive\r\n  should be reversed because (1) it was inconsistent with the family court's\r\n  refusal to award attorney's fees to either party, and (2) the family court\r\n  failed to make any specific findings that would justify holding him jointly\r\n  responsible for this expense.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe same equitable considerations that apply to\r\n  attorney's fees also apply to costs, i.e., such awards are within the sound\r\n  discretion of the family court.Â  Doe v. Doe, 370 S.C. 206, 220, 634\r\n  S.E.2d 51, 59 (Ct. App. 2006); Wood v. Wood, 298 S.C. 30, 33, 378 S.E.2d\r\n  59, 61 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  Even if the family court's findings of fact on an\r\n  issue are insufficient, this Court may make its own findings according to the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence if the record is sufficient.Â  Bowers v. Bowers,\r\n  349 S.C. 85, 98-99, 561 S.E.2d 610, 617 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nHusband himself acknowledged in his brief\r\n  that the court noted &quot;the accountant partially benefitted the Husband in\r\n  that she compiled and organized information that assisted the Court in making\r\n  the division.&quot;Â  He does not challenge the court's finding that the\r\n  complicated nature of the case warranted the assistance of an accountant to\r\n  calculate the valuations and did not hire his own accountant for this purpose.Â \r\n  The family court also noted Husband was at times uncooperative in furnishing\r\n  information in a timely manner, making valuations more difficult than\r\n  necessary. Â Under these circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion in\r\n  ordering Husband to pay one-half of the forensic accountant's fees.\r\n4.&nbsp; Finally, Husband\r\n  argues the family court erred in not giving him credit for funds he paid for\r\n  the benefit of Wife and the parties' child while the matter was pending in the\r\n  family court.Â  He contends each payment was made from the marital estate after\r\n  the initiation of the action and should have been reflected in the equitable\r\n  division of the marital property.Â  It is his position that the payments he made\r\n  on behalf of the parties' child should have been evenly divided between the\r\n  parties, giving him an offset for one-half of the corresponding amounts.Â  He\r\n  further contends he is entitled to an offset of the entire amount of any\r\n  vehicle payments he made on Wife's behalf after the commencement of this action.Â \r\n  Finally, he maintains that $22,000 allegedly paid from an M&amp;R Development account\r\n  to settle a lawsuit should have been deducted from the total marital estate.Â \r\n  We reject these arguments.\r\nFirst, the expenses on behalf of the\r\n  parties' child were paid from marital funds; furthermore, Husband did not pay\r\n  regular child support.Â  We therefore agree with the family court's decision to\r\n  consider these payments to be voluntary contributions by Husband for the\r\n  support of the child. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-620(B)(14) (Supp. 2009)\r\n  (including &quot;child custody arrangements and obligations at the time of the\r\n  entry of the order&quot; as factors in equitable apportionment decisions); King\r\n    v. King, 384 S.C. 134, 143, 681 S.E.2d 609, 614 (Ct. App. 2009) (&quot;The\r\n  appellate court looks to the overall fairness of the apportionment.&quot;). Â Second,\r\n  Husband paid his own personal expenses as well as Wife's vehicle payments from marital\r\n  funds; therefore, under his reasoning, if he is entitled to a credit for her\r\n  expenses, she would be entitled to a credit on his expenses.Â  Finally, Wife\r\n  acknowledged only that she had some nonspecific knowledge about a lawsuit; and,\r\n  as the family court explained in its order on reconsideration, Husband produced\r\n  no documentation about the alleged settlement or its terms.Â  We therefore find\r\n  no reason to reverse the family court's refusal to make the requested\r\n  adjustments.Â  See Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 542, 615 S.E.2d\r\n  98, 103 (2005) (&quot;The apportionment of marital property is within the\r\n  discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an\r\n  abuse of discretion.&quot;).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J., THOMAS and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
