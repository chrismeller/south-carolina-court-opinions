Stephenson, of Greenville, for Appellants.\r\n        Donald C. Coggins, Jr., of Spartanburg and Stacy Kaplan Wood, of\r\n          Charlotte, for Respondents.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: L. John Fisher, III and T. Randolph Forshee\r\n  (Appellants) appeal the circuit court's refusal to confirm their arbitration\r\n  award against Gibbs International, Inc. (Gibbs International) and James I. Gibbs\r\n  individually.Â  On appeal, Appellants argue the circuit court erred by: (1)\r\n  refusing to confirm the arbitration award; (2) finding the arbitrator exhibited\r\n  partiality and a manifest disregard or perverse misconstruction of the law; and\r\n  (3) dismissing James I. Gibbs from the case.Â  We reverse and remand.[1]Â  \r\n1. We find the circuit court erred in\r\n  refusing to confirm the arbitration award based on the finding that the\r\n  arbitrator was partial. Â Gibbs International and James I. Gibbs have failed to\r\n  provide evidence that the arbitrator's alleged bias was actual, direct,\r\n  definite, and capable of demonstration. Â The record does not indicate that the\r\n  arbitrator had any sort of interest in the proceedings or that he had any sort\r\n  of relationship with the Appellants in the matter.Â  While we do not condone the\r\n  alleged errors, courts are not free to vacate an arbitration award by an\r\n  arbitrator selected by the parties on mere legal error alone. Â See Consol.\r\n    Coal Co. v. Local 1643, United Mine Workers of Am., 48 F.3d 125, 130 (4th\r\n  Cir. 1995) (acknowledging the bias of the arbitrator as a factual finding and\r\n  applying the clearly erroneous rule, &quot;we hold that the Magistrate Judge\r\n  and district court's finding of per se bias was clearly erroneous . . .\r\n  . [Plaintiff] failed to demonstrate any partiality or improper motive on the\r\n  part of [the arbitrator] or that he and his brother had any interest in the\r\n  outcome of the dispute arbitrated.&quot;); see also Atl. Shores\r\n    Resort Joint Venture v. Martin, 731 F. Supp. 1279, 1283 (D.S.C. 1990)\r\n  (&quot;It is well settled, of course, that alleged bias on the part of an\r\n  arbitrator cannot be the basis for vacating an award unless the interest or\r\n  bias is direct, definite and capable of demonstration rather than remote,\r\n  uncertain, or speculative.&quot;) (internal quotation and citation omitted); Carpenter\r\n    v. Brooks, 139 N.C. App. 745, 755, 534 S.E.2d 641, 648 (N.C. Ct. App. 2000)\r\n  (&quot;[E]vident partiality . . . exists when an arbitrator's bias is direct,\r\n  definite and capable of demonstration rather than remote, uncertain, or\r\n  speculative.Â  There must exist specific facts that indicate improper motives on\r\n  the part of the arbitrator . . . .&quot;) (internal quotation and citation\r\n  omitted); Id. (&quot;[A] disappointed party's perception of rudeness on\r\n  the part of an arbitrator is not the sort of evident partiality contemplated by\r\n  the Act as grounds for vacating an award.&quot;) (internal quotation and\r\n  citation omitted); Three S Del., Inc. v. DataQuick Info. Sys., Inc., 492\r\n  F.3d 520, 530 (4th Cir. 2007) (applying the following four factors to determine\r\n  if a party has established evident bias: (1) the extent and character of the\r\n  arbitrator's personal interest in the proceedings; (2) the type of relationship\r\n  between the arbitrator and the party he is alleged to favor; (3) the connection\r\n  of that relationship to the arbitrator; and (4) the proximity in time between\r\n  the relationship and the arbitration proceeding).Â  \r\n2. We\r\n  find the circuit court erred in setting aside the arbitration award due to the\r\n  arbitrator's alleged manifest disregard of the law. Â See Harris v.\r\n    Bennett, 332 S.C. 238, 244, 503 S.E.2d 782, 786 (Ct. App. 1998) (stating in\r\n  addition to the five statutory grounds for vacating an arbitration award, an\r\n  award can also be vacated under the nonstatutory ground of &quot;manifest\r\n  disregard or perverse misconstruction of the law&quot;) (internal quotation and\r\n  citation omitted); Trident Technical Coll. v. Lucas &amp; Stubbs, Ltd.,\r\n  286 S.C. 98, 108, 333 S.E.2d 781, 787 (1985) (stating this ground is directed\r\n  at the conduct of the arbitrator and &quot;presupposes something beyond a mere\r\n  error in construing or applying the law&quot;) (internal quotation and citation\r\n  omitted); Harris, 332 S.C. at 246, 503 S.E.2d at 787 (asserting a\r\n  manifest disregard of the law is not just an erroneous application of the law); Weimer v. Jones, 364 S.C. 78, 80, 610 S.E.2d 850, 852 (Ct. App. 2005)\r\n  (&quot;A manifest disregard of the law occurs when the arbitrator knew of a\r\n  governing legal principle yet refused to apply it, and the law\r\n  disregarded was well defined, explicit, and clearly applicable to the\r\n  case.&quot;) (internal quotation and citation omitted); Lauro v. Visnapuu,\r\n  351 S.C. 507, 519, 570 S.E.2d 551, 557 (Ct. App. 2002) (stating although courts\r\n  have not hesitated in certain cases to vacate an arbitration award when there\r\n  is a manifest disregard or perverse misconstruction of the law, those cases\r\n  have been exceedingly rare, requiring circumstances far more egregious than\r\n  mere errors in interpreting or applying the law).\r\n3. We find the circuit court erred in\r\n  dismissing James I. Gibbs individually from the case.Â  Procedurally, we find\r\n  this issue was not properly before the circuit court.Â  This argument was not\r\n  raised by James I. Gibbs until his motion in opposition to Appellants' motion\r\n  to confirm the arbitration hearing. This issue was not ruled upon by the\r\n  arbitrator in his initial order or raised in the defendants' motion to reconsider.Â \r\n  In fact, the motion to reconsider refers to the defendants in plural form,\r\n  suggesting that James I. Gibbs was not contesting his individual liability at\r\n  that time.Â  In their answer, Gibbs International and James I. Gibbs did not\r\n  dispute James I. Gibbs' individual liability nor ask that he be dismissed as a\r\n  defendant.Â  Here, there is nothing in the record to indicate that James I.\r\n  Gibbs tried to dismiss the case earlier and the defendants collectively\r\n  requested that the matter be sent to arbitration. Â Moreover, this issue was\r\n  never addressed during arbitration. Â See Gissel v.

Appellants\r\n  contend the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict on their\r\n  fraudulent conveyance claim against Judy Barnett.Â  At oral argument, Appellants\r\n  stated that the success of this claim was &quot;wrapped up in&quot; the success\r\n  of their claim for constructive trust.Â  However, Appellants concede that their\r\n  constructive trust claim is not preserved for our review because they failed to\r\n  indicate in the record that the issue was raised and ruled on by the trial\r\n  court.Â  See S.C.

Gibson-Wall Co.,\r\n  363 S.C. 334, 339, 611 S.E.2d 485, 487-88 (2005) (holding that Appellant has\r\n  the burden of presenting a sufficient record to allow review); Rule 210(h),\r\n  SCACR (&quot;[T]he appellate court will not consider any fact which does not\r\n  appear in the Record on Appeal.&quot;).Â  Thus, we affirm as to both of these claims. \r\n2. Appellants\r\n  contend the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict on their civil\r\n  conspiracy claim against Judy Barnett.Â  A plaintiff must demonstrate all three\r\n  elements of civil conspiracy in order to maintain a claim.Â  Pye v. Estate of\r\n    Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 566-68, 633 S.E.2d 505, 511-12 (2006) (listing the elements of civil conspiracy as 1) the combination of two or more people; 2) for the\r\n  purpose of injuring the plaintiff;Â  3) which causes special damages). Â Appellants presented no evidence of\r\n  special damages.Â  Because the Appellants failed to present evidence of an\r\n  element of this claim, the trial judge did not err in directing a verdict.\r\n3. On\r\n  cross-appeal, Richard and Judy Barnett contend that the trial court erred in\r\n  denying their motion for a new trial.Â  We hold that the trial court acted\r\n  within its discretion in denying the motion.Â  Swicegood v.

[1]\r\nI.&nbsp; Facts\r\nCatherine Evrard and Richard Panas married on June 18, 1994. Â Â After the birth of their\r\n  first child in May 1995, Panas told Evrard he used crack cocaine.Â  Evrard\r\n  testified their marriage began to change when Panas opened a list broker\r\n  business and a printing company and he spent less time with his family.Â  As a\r\n  list broker, Panas purchased lists of names and addresses.Â  He then sent to the\r\n  people on the lists a sweepstake offering them a chance to win if they first responded\r\n  by sending money.Â  He kept the money, generated his own lists of the responding\r\n  people, and sold those lists.Â  Panas owned six companies, at least three of\r\n  which participated in the list broker business.Â  \r\nPanas\r\n  physically abused Evrard and had an affair with a woman named Gallina Fielder.[2]Â \r\n  In addition, he was convicted of drug possession and criminal domestic\r\n  violence.Â  \r\nEvrard filed\r\n  for divorce on January 27, 2003.Â  A temporary consent order filed on July 21,\r\n  2003 granted Evrard temporary custody of the children with visitation rights to\r\n  Panas.Â  The order also granted Evrard temporary possession of the marital home\r\n  and required Panas to pay $4,000 in monthly support and tuition for the\r\n  children's private education.Â  \r\nEvrard filed\r\n  four motions to compel discovery responses and a complete financial declaration\r\n  from Panas between January 28, 2004 and January 9, 2006.Â  Due to Panas's repeated failure to provide complete financial information to Evrard, the court twice\r\n  refused to allow his CPA to testify about certain topics.Â  First, on June 15, 2006, the court denied Panas's motion for modification of temporary child support,\r\n  based on an alleged decrease in his income, after the judge refused to allow\r\n  testimony from his CPA concerning the alleged income reduction.Â  Second, at the\r\n  divorce hearing on September 18, 2007, the trial judge again refused to let\r\n  Panas's CPA testify as to valuations of some of his businesses &quot;due to the\r\n  failure on the part of the Husband to produce that documentation.&quot;Â  Additionally,\r\n  between 2005 and the present Panas has retained three different attorneys and,\r\n  at times, appeared pro se.Â  \r\nThe divorce\r\n  decree was issued on July 2, 2008.Â  It awarded to Evrard custody, alimony in\r\n  the amount of $7,500 per month, child support in the amount of $4,000 per\r\n  month, the marital home, and $2,062,872 to be paid from the remainder of six\r\n  marital properties.Â  The decree further stated if Panas did not pay, Evrard \r\n\r\n\tshall\r\n  be authorized to sell whatever property of the Husband that can be located\r\n  within this State or any other State upon proper application to satisfy this\r\n  judgment.Â  The Clerk of Court shall be authorized to execute whatever deeds\r\n  and/or documentation necessary to convey title of the Husband's properties to\r\n  the Wife for purposes of sale.\r\n\r\nPanas appealed, alleging\r\n  error in the family court's award of alimony and child support, and the\r\n  valuation of his businesses and marital property.Â  \r\nBy September\r\n  2008 Panas had not conveyed the marital home or paid the amounts due to Evrard.[3]Â \r\n  Evrard made a motion for conveyance of the marital home and other properties to\r\n  satisfy the arrearages.Â  The parties resolved the dispute in an agreement which\r\n  was approved by consent order on November 3, 2008.Â  The agreement required\r\n  Panas to sell four properties and apply the proceeds to his delinquent child\r\n  support, alimony, attorney and guardian ad litem fees, and equitable\r\n  apportionment.Â  It also required Panas to transfer the marital home\r\n  &quot;promptly.&quot;Â  \r\nOn June 3,\r\n  2009, Evrard filed a rule to show cause why Panas had not paid child support or\r\n  alimony since November 3, 2008, transferred the marital home to Evrard, or sold\r\n  the four properties as required by the consent order.Â  On August 25, 2009, the\r\n  family court issued an order finding Panas in contempt of court based on his\r\n  noncompliance with both the divorce decree and consent order.[4]Â \r\n  As punishment for his contempt, the family court ordered Panas to spend ninety\r\n  days in the York County Detention or Public Works Center and could purge his contempt\r\n  by paying the $69,000 in arrearages of child support and alimony by September\r\n  3, 2009.Â  Further, the order specified:\r\n\r\n\t[T]he\r\n  parties may, by mutual written agreement, extend the time for the defendant to\r\n  purge himself of contempt for an additional thirty days, if the defendant has\r\n  identified to the plaintiff property of sufficient value and liquidity,\r\n  satisfactory to the plaintiff, that defendant proposes to promptly transfer to\r\n  the plaintiff or liquidate, and then promptly transfers or liquidates, in order\r\n  to satisfy the defendant's support arrearage.Â  Such property does not include\r\n  real or personal property which the plaintiff is already entitled to receive\r\n  under the Decree or the Consent Order or as a result of the defendant's failure\r\n  to comply with either order.\r\n\r\nThe order also required\r\n  the clerk of court to transfer the marital home to Evrard.Â  \r\nOn August 13,\r\n  2009, Evrard filed a &quot;Motion to Dismiss or For Remand&quot; with this\r\n  court based on the fugitive disentitlement doctrine.Â  In his response, Panas\r\n  stated he intended to purge himself.Â  This court denied the motion on September\r\n  16, 2009.Â  Panas failed to purge himself and a bench warrant for his arrest was\r\n  issued on December 2, 2009.Â  \r\nTo date, Panas has\r\n  not complied with the contempt order.Â  The bench warrant is active and remains\r\n  unserved because Panas's whereabouts are unknown to the court.Â  However, Panas\r\n  &quot;has offered to sign over his interest in three rental properties\r\n  (referenced in the Divorce Decree) to the Respondent.Â  . . . [and] contends\r\n  that the equity in said properties exceeds the amount required under the\r\n  contempt order, and should be considered compliance.&quot;Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Fugitive\r\n  Disentitlement Doctrine\r\nThe fugitive\r\n  disentitlement doctrine &quot;is a discretionary right of an appellate court to\r\n  'dismiss an appeal by a person who stands in contempt of court in the\r\n  proceeding in which he seeks to take an appeal.'&quot;Â  Posner v. Posner,\r\n  383 S.C. 26, 33, 677 S.E.2d 616, 620&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009) (quoting Scelba v.\r\n    Scelba, 342 S.C. 223, 228, 535 S.E.2d 668, 671 (Ct. App. 2000)).Â  It is a\r\n  discretionary right and inherent power of the court which &quot;has long been\r\n  recognized by the United States Supreme Court.&quot;Â  Scelba, 342 S.C.\r\n  at 228, 535 S.E.2d at 671 (citing Ortega-Rodriguez v. United States, 507\r\n  U.S. 234, 244 (1993)).Â  For an appellate court to invoke the doctrine as the\r\n  basis for dismissing an appeal, &quot;two prerequisites must be met: (1) the\r\n  appellant must be a fugitive; and (2) there must be a connection between the\r\n  fugitive status and the appellate process the appellant seeks to\r\n  utilize.&quot;Â  Id. at 229, 535 S.E.2d at 671.Â  The policy behind and\r\n  rationales for the doctrine are: &quot;'[1] the difficulty of enforcement\r\n  against one not willing to subject himself to the court's\r\n  authority, [2] the inequity of allowing that 'fugitive' to use the resources of\r\n  the courts only if the outcome is an aid to him, [3] the need to avoid prejudice\r\n  to the nonfugitive party, and [4] the discouragement of flights from justice.'&quot;Â  Id. at 228-29, 535 S.E.2d at 671 (quoting United States v. Barnette,\r\n  129 F.3d 1179, 1183 (11th Cir. 1997)).\r\nThis court has\r\n  dismissed two cases with published opinions based on the fugitive\r\n  disentitlement doctrine which provide clarification of its two requirements.\r\nFirst, in Scelba,\r\n  this court dismissed an appeal based on the doctrine where the appellant wife\r\n  failed to appear on two occasions.Â  Id. at 229, 535 S.E.2d at 671-72.Â \r\n  First, she did not appear at a rule to show cause hearing after she refused to\r\n  let her husband come to the family home to take a property inventory.Â  Id. at 226-27, 535 S.E.2d at 670.Â  Second, after the issuance of a bench warrant\r\n  due to the first failure to appear, the wife again did not appear at a\r\n  deposition. Â Id. at 227, 535 S.E.2d at 670.Â  Then, because she was\r\n  afraid she would be arrested, the wife did not appear at the final hearing, but\r\n  then appealed the ground for the divorce, allocation of marital property,\r\n  valuation of pension plans, and award of attorney fees.Â  Id. at 227, 535\r\n  S.E.2d at 670-71.Â  This court found that the first requirement was met because\r\n  &quot;[w]ithout question, the wife, by her own actions, has become a fugitive\r\n  in this litigation&quot; and &quot;the matters giving rise to the bench warrant\r\n  have not been adjudicated because of the wife's refusal to submit to the family\r\n  court's jurisdiction.&quot;Â  Id. at 229, 535 S.E.2d at 671-72.Â  The\r\n  second requirement was met because:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  Husband's attempts to secure the Wife's compliance with the Court's Temporary\r\n  Order and be able to inventory and appraise all furnishings were frustrated by\r\n  the Wife. . . . Â To effectuate the property division, the family court granted the husband a\r\n  judgment against the wife . . . and ordered the wife to transfer certain assets\r\n  to the husband . . . . Â Nevertheless, as long as the wife refuses to submit to\r\n  the jurisdiction of the family court and to otherwise disclose her whereabouts,\r\n  the husband has no practical means of enforcing the final divorce decree,\r\n  whether that enforcement involves compelling the transfer of certain assets or\r\n  executing a judgment.\r\n\r\nId. at 230-31, 535\r\n  S.E.2d at 672.Â  Because both requirements for application of the doctrine were\r\n  satisfied, the appeal was dismissed.\r\nThis court\r\n  again applied the doctrine to a divorce case in Posner, where the\r\n  husband was found to be in contempt for failing to comply with certain terms of\r\n  a marital agreement and a bench warrant was issued for his arrest after he\r\n  failed to appear pursuant to a rule to show cause.Â  383 S.C. at 29-30, 677\r\n  S.E.2d at 618.Â  The marital agreement provided that the wife receive a share of\r\n  the husband's tax deferred savings plan.Â  Id. at 29, 677 S.E.2d at 618.Â \r\n  Three years later, the husband made a motion requesting the family court to\r\n  reduce the amount given to the wife, alleging she was overpaid.Â  Id. at\r\n  30-31, 677 S.E.2d at 619.Â  The family court denied the motion and found that\r\n  the wife received a proper distribution.Â  Id. at 31, 677 S.E.2d at 619.Â \r\n  When the husband appealed, the wife argued it should be dismissed based on the\r\n  fugitive disentitlement doctrine.Â  Id. at 29, 677 S.E.2d at 618.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  determining that the husband failed to purge himself of contempt, this court applied\r\n  the doctrine.Â  Id. at 33, 677 S.E.2d at 620.Â  The first requirement was\r\n  met because &quot;[t]he family court found Husband in contempt for failing to\r\n  comply with a number of provisions in the Agreement.Â  Moreover, since the\r\n  issuance of the bench warrant by the family court, Husband has yet to appear\r\n  before that court.&quot;Â  Id. at 34, 677 S.E.2d at 621.Â  The second\r\n  requirement for application of the doctrine was also met because \r\n\r\n\tHusband's\r\n  fugitive status derives from not only his failure to appear before the family\r\n  court pursuant to the Rule to Show Cause resulting in a bench warrant being\r\n  issued for his arrest, but also his failure to comply with the provisions of\r\n  the Agreement itself. On appeal, Husband asks this Court to interpret the\r\n  Agreement in a manner more favorable to him than the family court's\r\n  interpretation. Husband has failed to abide by the court order which approves\r\n  the Agreement, absented himself from the jurisdiction, and evaded the processes\r\n  of the court. In short, his conduct frustrates the administration of justice. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nId. at 35, 677\r\n  S.E.2d at 621.Â  Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn this case,\r\n  both requirements of the doctrine are also met.Â  First, Panas is a fugitive.Â \r\n  He has not been seen in the family court since the final divorce hearing in\r\n  September 2007.Â  Panas still has neither complied with the divorce decree or\r\n  consent order nor purged himself of his contempt.Â  Furthermore, due to his\r\n  absence, the bench warrant issued for his arrest remains unserved.Â  As in Scelba and Posner, the appellant remains absent from the litigation and the\r\n  matters giving rise to the bench warrant have not been resolved because of\r\n  Panas's refusal to comply with court orders.\r\nSecond, there\r\n  is a connection between the fugitive status and the appellate process Panas\r\n  seeks to utilize.Â  The contempt order arises from Panas's refusal to pay\r\n  alimony and child support and to comply with the consent order which required\r\n  him to sell rental properties and transfer the proceeds to Evrard.Â  As in Scelba,\r\n  as long as Panas refuses to comply with the court's order and disclose his\r\n  whereabouts, Evrard has no practical means of enforcing either the divorce\r\n  decree or the consent order.Â  \r\nOriginally, the\r\n  divorce decree allowed Panas to keep the rental properties, but authorized the\r\n  clerk of court to transfer them to Evrard if Panas did not timely pay her the\r\n  amounts due.Â  The consent order, which Panas agreed to, then required him to\r\n  sell four of the properties and transfer the proceeds to Evrard.Â  Finally, the\r\n  contempt order required Panas to pay all arrearages, but allowed him to\r\n  identify property to satisfy them if Evrard agreed.Â  If Panas chose to identify\r\n  property as satisfaction, it could not be property Evrard was already entitled\r\n  to receive under either the divorce decree or consent order, and he was\r\n  required to &quot;promptly transfer&quot; such property to her.Â  Panas argues this\r\n  court should not apply the doctrine because he &quot;has offered to sign over\r\n  his interest in three rental properties . . . the equity in said properties\r\n  exceeds the amount required under the contempt order, and should be considered\r\n  compliance.&quot;Â  We disagree.Â  Because any property Panas chose to identify\r\n  to purge himself of contempt could not be property to which Evrard was already\r\n  entitled, his offer of the rental properties is not compliance.Â  Furthermore, to\r\n  seek the aid of this court by appeal, Panas must actually purge himself of\r\n  contempt, rather than merely offering compliance.\r\nDISMISSED.\r\nSHORT and\r\n  WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Panas transferred marital property to Fielder during the pendency of the\r\n  divorce.Â  She was added as a party, but failed to answer or appear. \r\n[3] These matters were not stayed by Panas's appeal to this court.Â  Rule 241(b),\r\n  SCACR.\r\n[4] Panas did not appeal the contempt order.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-535","title":"Fenollol Group v.

Shahid, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J.:Â  This appeal arises out of Virginia Mappus's dock\r\n  permit application.Â  The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental\r\n  Control (DHEC) denied her application in part because it determined that an\r\n  unnamed tributary, which Mappus wanted her dock to cross, was navigable.Â  The\r\n  Administrative Law Court (ALC) reversed the final DHEC Board decision and authorized\r\n  Mappus to construct her dock over the tributary and out to Bohicket Creek.Â \r\n  DHEC appeals the ALC's decision.Â  We reverse and remand.[1]\r\nI.&nbsp; Facts\r\nMappus lives on\r\n  Bohicket Road in Johns Island.Â  There is an unnamed tributary that opens into\r\n  Bohicket Creek and runs parallel to Bohicket Road.Â  The tributary eventually\r\n  separates into two branches.Â  Prior to submitting her dock permit application\r\n  on October 2, 2006, Mappus had a permitted dock extending to the south branch\r\n  of the tributary.Â  Her application to DHEC sought to extend her dock out to\r\n  Bohicket Creek.Â  To reach Bohicket Creek, Mappus's dock had to cross both the\r\n  south and north branches of the tributary.Â  DHEC staff granted the application\r\n  in part.Â  It issued a permit allowing Mappus to extend her dock across the\r\n  south branch of the tributary, but denied her request to extend it across the\r\n  north branch to Bohicket Creek because it deemed that branch\r\n  &quot;navigable&quot; under South Carolina Code of Regulations 30-12(A).[2]Â \r\n  The DHEC Board conducted a final agency review and affirmed the staff decision\r\n  based on its conclusion that the tributary was navigable.Â  Mappus argued that\r\n  two docks between hers and the mouth of the tributary rendered the tributary\r\n  non-navigable at her property.Â  The two docks, the Atkinson dock and the Combos\r\n  dock, were the subjects of prior litigation with DHEC whose results are\r\n  relevant here.Â  \r\nThe Atkinson dock\r\n  is located at the mouth of the tributary and extends farther into the tributary\r\n  than allowed by its permit.Â  In a prior case, Brownlee v. South Carolina\r\n    Department of Health &amp; Environmental Control,&nbsp;372 S.C. 119, 128,\r\n  641 S.E.2d 45, 49&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2007), rev'd, 382 S.C. 129, 676 S.E.2d\r\n  116 (2009), this court determined that the Atkinson dock was a man-made\r\n  impediment that rendered the tributary non-navigable.Â  Therefore, DHEC granted\r\n  multiple dock permit applications to cross the tributary and extend docks to\r\n  Bohicket Creek.Â  However, after the ALC's decision in this case, the supreme\r\n  court reversed this court's Brownlee decision, finding that\r\n  &quot;navigability does not hinge on the existence of man-made\r\n  impediments.&quot;Â  Brownlee v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control,&nbsp;382\r\n  S.C. 129, 141, 676 S.E.2d 116, 122 (2009).Â  \r\nThe Combos dock,\r\n  located between the Atkinson dock and Mappus, is illegally built to Bohicket\r\n  Creek without a permit.Â  To access the mouth of the tributary and get to\r\n  Bohicket Creek, Mappus must navigate under the Combos dock.Â  DHEC obtained a\r\n  circuit court order directing Combos to remove the dock.Â  On June 15, 2009,\r\n  after the underlying Mappus decision by the ALC, the supreme court affirmed the\r\n  circuit court order in S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control v. Combos,\r\n  Op. No. 2009-MO-029 (Sup. Ct. filed June 15, 2009).\r\nMappus\r\n  appealed the final DHEC Board decision to the ALC.Â  On February 3, 2009, it\r\n  reversed DHEC's decision requiring the dock to terminate at the north branch of\r\n  the tributary.Â  The ALC's order authorized Mappus &quot;to construct a dock\r\n  terminating at Bohicket Creek at the location, and in the configuration, set\r\n  forth in her permit application.&quot;Â  The ALC relied upon this court's\r\n  subsequently reversed Brownlee decision, which found that the Atkinson\r\n  dock rendered the tributary non-navigable.Â  Brownlee,&nbsp;372 S.C. at\r\n  128, 641 S.E.2d at 49.Â  Based on that decision, the ALC also determined the\r\n  Combos dock was a man-made impediment which independently rendered the\r\n  tributary non-navigable and warranted allowing Mappus to extend her dock to\r\n  Bohicket Creek.Â  Furthermore, the ALC order stated that &quot;the termination\r\n  of the tributary closely near the location where Petitioner's dock will cross\r\n  over the tributary is an exceptional geographic condition that warrants further\r\n  consideration in determining whether Petitioner should be allowed to extend her\r\n  dock to Bohicket Creek.&quot; \r\nDHEC\r\n  appeals the ALC's ruling, arguing that its reliance on this court's Brownlee decision is an error of law requiring reversal.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  1-23-610(B) (Supp. 2009) (&quot;The court of appeals may . . . reverse or\r\n  modify the decision if the substantive rights of the petitioner have been\r\n  prejudiced because the finding, conclusion, or decision is: . . . (d) affected\r\n  by other error of law.&quot;).Â  We agree.Â  The supreme court's Brownlee decision requires the ALC, on remand, to review the final DHEC Board decision\r\n  in accordance with the law that a man-made impediment does not affect\r\n  navigability.\r\nII.&nbsp; DHEC\r\n  Discretion\r\nDHEC also contends the\r\n  ALC erred in finding that the termination of the tributary close to the\r\n  location where Mappus's proposed dock would cross it is an &quot;exceptional\r\n  geographic condition&quot; that warrants crossing a navigable creek under South\r\n  Carolina Code of Regulations 30-12(A)(1)(n).Â  Conversely, Mappus argues that it\r\n  qualifies as an additional sustaining ground for affirming the ALC's order\r\n  granting her dock extension to Bohicket Creek.Â  We find the categorization of\r\n  part of the tributary as &quot;an exceptional geographic condition&quot; is not\r\n  an additional sustaining ground.Â  The order merely states that the finding\r\n  &quot;warrants further consideration,&quot; but reaches no conclusion as to the\r\n  effect of any such consideration.Â  Rather, we find that the issue is whether\r\n  DHEC has discretion to allow Mappus to cross a navigable creek.\r\nThe regulation\r\n  governing construction of docks is South Carolina Code of Regulations 30-12(A).Â \r\n  When DHEC considered the dock permit applications in Brownlee, the\r\n  version of 30-12(A) in existence stated in pertinent part only: &quot;Docks\r\n  must extend to the first navigable creek with a defined channel as evidenced by\r\n  a significant change in grade with the surrounding marsh.Â  Such creeks cannot\r\n  be abridged in order to obtain access to deeper water.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Regs. 30-12(A)(2)(n) (Supp. 2001).Â  Thus, DHEC had no discretion under the\r\n  regulation as it was analyzed in Brownlee.Â  In contrast, when Mappus\r\n  filed her dock permit application with DHEC in 2006, the regulation had been\r\n  amended to state in relevant part: \r\nDocks\r\n  must extend to the first navigable\r\n  creek, within extensions of upland property lines or corridor lines, that has a\r\n  defined channel as evidenced by a significant change in grade with the\r\n  surrounding marsh; or having an established history of navigational access or\r\n  use.Â  Rare geographic circumstances, such as very close proximity of a\r\n  significantly larger creek within extensions of property or corridor lines, may\r\n  warrant dock extension to a creek other than the first navigable\r\n  creek.Â  A creek with an established history of navigational use may also be\r\n  considered as navigable.Â  Such creeks cannot be bridged in\r\n  order to obtain access to deeper water. . . . Â In exceptional cases, the\r\n  Department may allow an open water channel to be bridged if current access is\r\n  prohibited by other man made or natural restrictions or if site-specific\r\n  conditions warrant such a crossing. \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-12(A)(1)(n) (Supp. 2005).Â  Therefore, in Mappus's case,\r\n  DHEC is afforded discretion in &quot;rare geographic circumstances&quot; and\r\n  &quot;exceptional cases.&quot;Â  Mappus contends that these regulatory changes\r\n  &quot;provide the flexibility necessary to address Respondent's situation&quot;\r\n  and allow DHEC to exercise discretion in issuing dock permits, which it failed\r\n  to use when considering her application.Â  Â Â Â  \r\nWe agree with Mappus that the regulation in place at the time of her application afforded\r\n  DHEC discretion.Â  On remand, the ALC must determine whether DHEC properly\r\n  exercised such discretion when determining navigability in light of the 2005 amendments\r\n  to South Carolina Code of Regulations 30-12(A)(1)(n).[3]Â  The ALC is in a better\r\n  position than this court to judge the exercise of such discretion.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Conclusion\r\nWe remand this case\r\n  to the ALC for further proceedings in accordance with Brownlee, Combos,\r\n  and the 2005 amendments to South Carolina Code of Regulations 30-12(A)(1)(n).\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nSHORT\r\n  and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] &quot;Docks must extend to the first navigable creek\r\n  . . . .&quot;Â  S.C.

As to whether the trial court erred by admitting the\r\n  pistol and holding it was relevant:Â  Rule 401, SCRE (&quot;Relevant evidence\r\n  means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of\r\n  consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable\r\n  than it would be without evidence.&quot;);Â  State v. Quillien, 263 S.C. 87,\r\n  91, 207 S.E.2d 814, 816 (1974) (&quot;It is a well established rule of law that\r\n  the trial judge has broad discretion concerning the admission of evidence.Â \r\n  That discretion will not be overturned on appeal unless clearly abused.&quot;); State v.

Blankenship, Jr., of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Andrew W. Countryman, of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Carrell Homes, Ltd. (Carrell) appeals the\r\n  trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of attorney Richard E. Lester and Van Osdell, Lester, Howe &amp;\r\n  Jordan, P.A., (collectively Lester).Â  Carrell appeals the grant of summary\r\n  judgment, arguing the trial court erred in finding the following: (1) the\r\n  statute of limitations barred its legal malpractice action and (2) Carrell\r\n  failed to support its allegations of professional negligence with expert\r\n  testimony.Â  Â We affirm.[1]\r\n1. As to whether the trial court erred in granting Lester's\r\n  summary judgment motion based on the statute of limitations:Â  Carrell conceded it had actual knowledge of Lester's\r\n  wrongful conduct more than three years before it filed and served its summons\r\n  and complaint.Â  SeeÂ  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(5) (2005) (providing a\r\n  three year statute of limitations for &quot;any injury to the person or rights\r\n  of another, not arising on contract and not enumerated by law&quot;); Berry\r\n    v. McLeod, 328 S.C. 435, 444, 492 S.E.2d 794, 799 (Ct. App. 1997) (finding\r\n  section 15-3-530(5) provides a three-year statute of limitations for legal malpractice\r\n  actions).Â  Carrell also knew, or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should\r\n  have known, it had a cause of action against Lester arising out of Lester's\r\n  wrongful conduct more than three years before it initiated the legal\r\n  malpractice action. The CEO and Chairman of Carrell stated he understood more\r\n  than three years before the initiation of the action that Lester had not\r\n  &quot;adequately protected Carrell&quot; and he understood he was damaged as a\r\n  result of the early closing because his interests were unsecured. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-535 (2005) (stating &quot;[A]ll actions initiated under\r\n  Section 15-3-530(5) must be commenced within three years after the person knew\r\n  or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known that he had a\r\n  cause of action.&quot;).Â  Additionally, &quot;the fact that the injured party\r\n  may not comprehend the full extent of the damage is immaterial.&quot;Â  Dean\r\n    v. Ruscon Corp., 321 S.C. 360, 364, 468 S.E.2d 645, 647 (1996).Â  Thus, viewing\r\n  the evidence in the light most favorable to Carrell, the evidence supported the\r\n  trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Lester.Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\n2.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General\r\n          Donald J. Zelenka, and Assistant Attorney General J. Anthony Mabry, all of Columbia;\r\n          and Solicitor Scarlett A. Wilson, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Kieve Milik Smith was tried with Leo\r\n  Corderrel Gadsden and Anthony Wilder for burglary, kidnapping, murder, and\r\n  assault and battery with intent to kill (ABWIK) after the home invasion of\r\n  Patricia Green and subsequent shootings of James\r\n  Williams and Sterling Spann.Â  Smith was convicted on\r\n  all charges.Â  Smith appeals his convictions, arguing the trial court erred in:\r\n  (1) denying his directed verdict motion and (2) admitting drug evidence when he\r\n  was not charged with drug offenses.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\n1. Smith\r\n  contends the trial court erred in denying his directed verdict motion because\r\n  the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to convict him.Â  However, the\r\n  State presented sufficient evidence the\r\n  three perpetrators of the home invasion and subsequent shootings acted in\r\n  concert pursuant to a common design, sufficient evidence Smith was one of the\r\n  three perpetrators, and sufficient evidence proving each crime charged.Â  Under the &quot;hand of one, the hand of all&quot;\r\n  theory, &quot;one who joins with another to accomplish an illegal purpose is\r\n  liable criminally for everything done by his confederate incidental to the\r\n  execution of the common design and purpose.&quot;Â  State v. Langley, 334\r\n  S.C. 643, 648, 515 S.E.2d 98, 101 (1999).Â  When ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned\r\n  with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.Â  State v.\r\n    Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006).Â  The State produced sufficient\r\n  evidence to show the three perpetrators of the home invasion and subsequent\r\n  shootings acted in concert pursuant to a common design and purpose because the\r\n  three men communicated and took instructions from each other during the home\r\n  invasion and shootings: Gadsden got duct\r\n  tape to bind Green at the direction of Wilder; Gadsden acted as lookout informing the others when\r\n  people arrived at the house; Smith stopped searching the house when Wilder told\r\n  him to help take care of people outside; and Smith chased Williams at the\r\n  direction of Gadsden.Â  The State also\r\n  produced sufficient evidence to show Smith was one of the three men involved in\r\n  the invasion and shootings because a mask found by an officer had Smith's DNA\r\n  on it, and a neighbor identified Williams's red Nike tennis shoes as the shoes\r\n  worn by the man who chased and shot at one of the victims.Â  Lastly, the State\r\n  established sufficient evidence proving each crime charged.Â  For the murder charge, sufficient evidence existed to\r\n  establish Spann was killed with malice aforethought because he was dragged out\r\n  of his car and fatally shot by one of the defendants. Â See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-10 (2003) (defining murder as &quot;the killing of any person\r\n  with malice aforethought, either express or implied&quot;).Â  For the\r\n  first-degree burglary charge, sufficient evidence exists to establish Smith\r\n  entered Green's house with the intent to commit a crime therein and Gadsden\r\n  caused physical injury to Green.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  16-11-311(A)(1) (2003) (defining first-degree burglary as the entering of\r\n  &quot;a dwelling without consent and with intent to commit a crime in the\r\n  dwelling&quot; and either he or another participant in the crime &quot;causes\r\n  physical injury to a person who is not a participant in the crime&quot;).Â  For\r\n  the kidnapping charge, sufficient evidence exists to establish Green was\r\n  unlawfully seized and confined by duct tape.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  16-3-910 (2003) (defining kidnapping as when participants &quot;unlawfully\r\n  seize, confine, inveigle, decoy, kidnap, abduct, or carry away any other person\r\n  by any means whatsoever without authority of law&quot;).Â  For the ABWIK charge,\r\n  sufficient evidence exists to establish Gadsden committed an unlawful act of a\r\n  violent nature with malice aforethought against Williams by shooting him four\r\n  times in the abdomen and Smith committed an unlawful act of a violent nature\r\n  with malice aforethought against Williams by chasing after and shooting at\r\n  Williams.Â  See State v. Coleman, 342 S.C. 172, 176, 536 S.E.2d\r\n  387, 389 (Ct. App. 2000) (defining ABWIK as &quot;an unlawful act of a violent\r\n  nature to the person of another with malice aforethought, either express or\r\n  implied&quot;); id. (holding a conviction for ABWIK does not require\r\n  specific intent to kill, but rather it is sufficient if there is shown some\r\n  general intent &quot;demonstrated by acts and conduct from which a jury may\r\n  naturally and reasonably infer intent&quot;).Â  Thus, viewing the evidence in the\r\n  light most favorable to the State, the evidence supported submitting the case\r\n  to the jury.\r\n2. Since\r\n  Smith did not raise an objection when the drug evidence was admitted, this\r\n  issue is not preserved for our review.Â  See State v. Turner,\r\n  373 S.C. 121, 126 n.1, 644 S.E.2d 693, 696 n.1 (2007) (holding an issue not\r\n  raised to or ruled upon by the trial court is not preserved on appeal); see Tupper v.

Earl Ellis, Jr., of\r\n          Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Thomas Joyner appeals the order of the circuit court\r\n  affirming the decision of the Appellate Panel of the Workers' Compensation Commission\r\n  awarding Joyner thirty percent impairment to the back and fifteen percent to\r\n  the leg.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn July 30, 2002,\r\n  Joyner was working as a landfill attendant for Sumter County when he injured\r\n  his back.Â  He was diagnosed with lumbar stenosis. Â His treatment was\r\n  complicated by his morbid obesity.Â  He underwent gastric bypass surgery in\r\n  December 2004 and lost over one hundred and fifty pounds at the time of the\r\n  hearing.Â  Joyner received five lumbar epidural steroid injections in his lower\r\n  back/spine.Â  Dr. Thomas Zgleszewski with the Center for Pain Management at Palmetto Health assigned Joyner thirteen\r\n  percent impairment to the back/spine.Â  Dr. Alfred Dawson of Florence Orthopedics\r\n  Associates performed an independent medical evaluation of Joyner and assigned\r\n  him an impairment rating of twenty percent to the lumbar spine and five percent\r\n  to the lower right extremity.Â  \r\nThe single\r\n  commissioner ruled Joyner had suffered a thirty percent permanent partial\r\n  disability to his back and a fifteen percent partial disability to the right\r\n  lower extremity.Â  The Appellate Panel and circuit court affirmed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  Administrative Procedures Act establishes our standard of review of decisions\r\n  by the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 454, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442\r\n  (2000).Â  Accordingly, this court can reverse\r\n  or modify the Appellate Panel's decision only if the appellant's substantial\r\n  rights have been prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law\r\n  or is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial\r\n  evidence on the whole record.Â  Id.; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5) (Supp.\r\n  2009).Â  &quot;Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor evidence\r\n  viewed from one side, but such evidence, when the whole record is considered,\r\n  as would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion\r\n  the [Appellate Panel] reached.&quot;Â  Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535\r\n  S.E.2d at 442.Â  The possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions does\r\n  not prevent the Appellate Panel's conclusions from being supported by\r\n  substantial evidence.Â  Tiller v. Nat'l Health Care Ctr., 334 S.C. 333,\r\n  338, 513 S.E.2d 843, 845 (1999).Â  The final determination of witness\r\n  credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the Appellate\r\n  Panel.Â  Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1. Disability rating\r\nJoyner argues the\r\n  Appellate Panel erred in holding he had only sustained a thirty percent\r\n  permanent partial disability to his back and a fifteen percent partial\r\n  disability to the right lower extremity.Â  He asserts he sustained at least\r\n  fifty percent loss of use of his back and thus should be presumed to have\r\n  suffered total and permanent disability pursuant to Section 42-9-30(21) of the\r\n  South Carolina Code, which provides:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    compensation for partial loss of use of the back shall be such proportions of\r\n    the periods of payment herein provided for total loss as such partial loss\r\n    bears to total loss, except that in cases where there is fifty percent or more\r\n    loss of use of the back the injured employee shall be presumed to have suffered\r\n    total and permanent disability and compensated under Section 42-9-10(B). The\r\n    presumption set forth in this item is rebuttable.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-30(21)\r\n  (Supp. 2009).\r\nJoyner\r\n  testified he was in pain all of the time.Â  He stated the pain goes from his\r\n  lower back down his right leg and the bottom of his right foot stays numb.Â \r\n  Joyner related he cannot stand for a long time, walk very far, or bend.Â  He\r\n  claimed he could only sit or stand for an hour and a half at best.Â  He\r\n  testified he has to use a cane because of knee problems.Â  He asserted that\r\n  since being released by Dr. Dawson and Dr. Zgleszewski, he had become worse,\r\n  but he cannot take pain medicine due to his gastric bypass surgery.Â  Joyner\r\n  opined he had suffered a fifty percent disability to his back and a fifty\r\n  percent disability to his right leg.Â  \r\nDr.\r\n  Zgleszewski, however, assigned Joyner a thirteen impairment to the back/spine.Â \r\n  Dr. Dawson assigned Joyner an impairment rating of twenty percent to the lumbar\r\n  spine and five percent to the lower right extremity. Â We find substantial\r\n  evidence supports the Appellate Panel's decision that Joyner sustained a thirty\r\n  percent permanent partial disability to his back and a fifteen percent partial\r\n  disability to the right lower extremity.\r\n2. Total incapacity to work\r\nJoyner argues the\r\n  Appellate Panel erred in not finding he was permanently and totally disabled\r\n  when the evidence established that his incapacity for work resulting from\r\n  injury was total.Â  \r\nJoyner\r\n  has a tenth grade education.Â  Before working at the landfill, he was a security\r\n  guard, a long-distance truck driver, and worked at a warehouse driving and\r\n  loading trucks.Â  \r\nDr. William\r\n  Stewart, a certified rehabilitation counselor, reported:\r\n\r\n  [W]hen\r\n    Mr. Joyner's significant physical limitations are considered in light of his\r\n    low educational levels, it is highly unlikely he would be able to find or\r\n    sustain employment.Â  And, based on his advanced age, work history, lack of\r\n    transferable job skills, illiterate functional educational abilities and\r\n    significant physical restrictions, he is not a reasonable vocational\r\n    rehabilitation candidate.Â  Consequently, I do not believe a reasonably stable\r\n    market exists or will exist for the types of services that Mr. Joyner is\r\n    physically, psychologically, educationally or vocationally capable of\r\n    performing/sustaining.Â  \r\n\r\nDr. Stewart noted Joyner was\r\n  fortunate to have the job he was currently in, &quot;albeit a rather benevolent\r\n  job.&quot;Â  \r\nDr.\r\n  Zgleszewski provided Joyner could work with restrictions.Â  Joyner could sit,\r\n  stand, and walk four to six hours.Â  In addition, he could occasionally lift one\r\n  to ten pounds from floor to knuckle or shoulder to overhead and eleven to\r\n  twenty pounds from knuckle to shoulder.Â  \r\nJoyner\r\n  did not miss any time from work due to his injury.Â  As a landfill attendant, he\r\n  has to weigh and inspect trucks.Â  He does not have to do any lifting.Â  Although\r\n  Joyner stated he could not drive a truck because he could not use his feet in a\r\n  repetitive motion, he acknowledged he had driven himself to the hearing.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find the record contains substantial evidence to support the Appellate Panel's ruling\r\n  that Joyner is not totally incapacitated from work.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the above\r\n  stated reasons, the order of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nHUFF,\r\n  KONDUROS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-546","title":"State v.

(Mother) appeals from the family court's order terminating her parental\r\n  rights to her two minor children (Son and Daughter, collectively Children).Â  The\r\n  family court concluded clear and convincing evidence supported termination of Mother's\r\n  parental rights pursuant to section 63-7-2870(1) of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (2010).Â  Additionally, the family court found termination of parental rights\r\n  (TPR) was in Children's best interests.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part,\r\n  and remand.\r\nThe grounds for TPR must be\r\n  proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v.\r\n    Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct.

Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 609,\r\n  582 S.E.2d 419, 423 (2003).Â  The family\r\n  court may order TPR upon finding one or more of the eleven statutory grounds is\r\n  satisfied and also finding TPR is in the best interest of the child.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570 (2010).Â  In a TPR case, the best interests of the child are\r\n  the paramount consideration.Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Smith, 343\r\n  S.C. 129, 133, 538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  &quot;The interests of the child shall prevail if the child's\r\n  interest and the parental rights conflict.&quot; Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2620 (2010). Â Â \r\nSection 63-7-2570(1) of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (2010) provides for TPR if:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    child or another child in the home has been harmed as defined in Section\r\n    63-7-20, and because of the severity or repetition of the abuse or neglect, it\r\n    is not reasonably likely that the home can be made safe within twelve months.\r\n    In determining the likelihood that the home can be made safe, the parent's\r\n    previous abuse or neglect of the child or another child in the home may be\r\n    considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Section 63-7-20(4) of the South Carolina Code (2010) states &quot;child abuse\r\n  or neglect or harm&quot; occurs when the parent &quot;inflicts or allows to be\r\n  inflicted upon the child physical or mental injury or engages in acts or\r\n  omissions which present a substantial risk of physical or mental injury to the\r\n  child . . . .&quot; \r\nWe agree with the family\r\n  court's findings that Daughter was harmed.Â  However, regarding whether it is\r\n  not reasonably likely the home can be made safe within twelve months, we find\r\n  the record is insufficient to determine whether it is reasonably likely\r\n  Mother's home could be made safe.Â  The original complaints for removal\r\n  requested the family court approve a treatment plan for Mother; however, the\r\n  Department of Social Services (DSS) testimony indicated that based on the\r\n  severity of Daughter's injuries, it did not offer Mother services.Â  However,\r\n  Mother requested DSS assistance in regaining custody of Children, and Mother completed\r\n  a psychological evaluation and attended parenting classes.Â  Mother also filed\r\n  for separation and divorce from her husband (Father), stating the only way she\r\n  could ensure the safety of Children was to be on her own.Â  Nonetheless, we are\r\n  concerned Mother admitted only she and Father cared for Daughter during the\r\n  weeks surrounding the time the injuries could have occurred.Â  Additionally, prior\r\n  to the abuse inflicted on Daughter, Son was removed from Mother's custody after\r\n  law enforcement received a report he was unattended in a highway.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  in its order, the family court did not provide any factual evidence in support\r\n  of its finding it was not reasonably likely Mother's home could be made safe\r\n  within twelve months as required by Rule 26, SCRFC.Â  See Rule 26(a), SCRFC (&quot;An order or judgment pursuant to\r\n  an adjudication in a domestic relations case shall set forth the specific\r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law to support the [family] court's\r\n  decision.&quot;).Â  \r\nAdditionally, we find the\r\n  record is insufficient to determine whether termination of Mother's parental\r\n  rights was in Children's best interests.Â  At the TPR hearing, the DSS foster\r\n  care worker assigned to Daughter admitted Mother supported and visited\r\n  Children.Â  Additionally, the case worker believed Children were bonded with\r\n  Mother.Â  Daughter's foster care worker had not met Daughter's foster parents\r\n  but believed Daughter was bonded with them. Without explanation, DSS\r\n  recommended it was in Daughter's best interests to be separated from Son.Â  DSS\r\n  did not present any testimony from Son's foster care worker regarding how Son\r\n  was adjusting in his current foster care placement or Son's future prospects\r\n  for permanent placement.Â  Additionally, the guardian ad litem did not believe\r\n  TPR was in Children's best interests.Â  Moreover, in its order, the family court\r\n  did not provide any factual evidence in support of its finding TPR was in the\r\n  best interests of Children as required by Rule 26, SCRFC.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we affirm the\r\n  family court's order as to its findings Daughter was harmed pursuant to section\r\n  63-7-20(4).Â  However, we reverse the family court's order as to its findings on\r\n  whether it is not reasonably likely Mother's home could be made safe within\r\n  twelve months and best interests.Â  We remand the matter in order for the family\r\n  court to make sufficient findings of fact as to whether it is not reasonably\r\n  likely Mother's home could be made safe within twelve months and best\r\n  interests.Â  The family court may order a hearing to further clarify the issues\r\n  surrounding whether Mother's home could be made safe, Children's current foster\r\n  care placements, Children's future prospects for permanent placement, and any\r\n  other relevant issues related to Children's best interests.Â Â Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED\r\n  IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nFEW, C.J., KONDUROS, J.,\r\n  and CURETON, A.J., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-550","title":"State v.

Â We affirm.[1]\r\nWhen assessing the\r\n  admissibility of an eyewitness identification, a court must apply a two-prong\r\n  test.Â  State v. Moore, 343 S.C.\r\n  282, 287, 540 S.E.2d 445, 447.Â  First, it\r\n  must determine whether the confrontation procedure used by the police was\r\n  unduly suggestive.Â  Id.Â  Only if the procedure was unduly suggestive must\r\n  a court decide whether &quot;under [the totality of] the circumstances the\r\n  identification was reliable notwithstanding any suggestive procedure.&quot;Â  Id. at 287, 540 S.E.2d at 447-48 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Â Factors to consider in &quot;evaluating the\r\n  likelihood of a misidentification&quot; include the following:\r\n\r\n  [T]he\r\n    opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the\r\n    witness'[s] degree of attention, the accuracy of the witness'[s] prior\r\n    description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness\r\n    at the confrontation, and the length of time between the crime and the\r\n    confrontation.\r\n\r\nNeil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 199-200 (1972).\r\nHere, the circuit court did\r\n  not abuse its discretion when it admitted the photographic lineup and the\r\n  in-court identification of Mack.Â  The photographic lineup was not unduly\r\n  suggestive. Â Â See State\r\n    v. Roberts, 522 S.E.2d 130, 133 (N.C. Ct. App. 1999) (&quot;[T]he police's\r\n  inability to include individuals in the lineup that shared defendant's unique\r\n  physical appearance 'cannot be attributed to the officers or regarded as the\r\n  kind of rigged &quot;suggestiveness&quot; in identification procedures\r\n  [prohibited by due process].'&quot; (citation omitted)); State v. Simmons,\r\n  384 S.C. 145, 168, 682 S.E.2d 19, 31 (Ct. App. 2009) (finding lineup\r\n  appropriate when the suspect's &quot;ears were smaller than those of the other\r\n  individuals in the [lineup]&quot;).\r\nRegardless of the\r\n  suggestiveness of the lineup, the circuit court's finding both the out-of-court\r\n  and in-court identifications were reliable under the totality of the\r\n  circumstances is reasonable.Â  First, the victim had multiple opportunities to\r\n  view the face of her assailant for extended periods of time.Â  Second, the\r\n  victim's proximity to her assailant, her status as victim, and her detailed\r\n  account of the event implies her focused attention on her assailant.Â  Third,\r\n  her descriptions of her assailant's height and age, notwithstanding his crossed\r\n  eye, are consistent with Mack's features at the time of his arrest.Â  Fourth, the\r\n  victim was confident enough Mack was her assailant to pick him &quot;right\r\n  away.&quot;Â  Finally, her identification of Mack in the photographic lineup\r\n  occurred only two days after the crime.Â  These facts are sufficient for the\r\n  circuit court to reasonably find a misidentification substantially unlikely.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTHOMAS,\r\n  PIEPER, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-551","title":"Singleton Place HOA v.

Hamlin O'Kelley, III and Gray B. Taylor, both of Mt. Pleasant,\r\n  for Appellants.\r\n\t\t\t\tGregory M. Alford, of Hilton Head Island, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Appellants,\r\n  Singleton Place Homeowners Association, Inc., Eugene J. Laurich, and Debra C.\r\n  Laurich, brought this declaratory judgment action against Respondent, the Town\r\n  of Hilton Head Island (the Town), and against the Town's Board of Zoning\r\n  Appeals, seeking a ruling that the Town's proposed use of its easement along\r\n  Collier Beach Road is unreasonable and creates a material burden on the\r\n  servient estate.Â  The case was referred to the master-in-equity, who concluded\r\n  that the easement was not limited in scope and that Appellants were not\r\n  entitled to the requested declaratory judgment.Â  Appellants seek review of this\r\n  ruling.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nInitially, we note that Appellants did not seek review of the\r\n  master's ruling that they were barred by the doctrine of estoppel by deed.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we may affirm on this ground alone. Â See Jones v. Lott, 387 S.C. 339, 346, 692 S.E.2d 900,\r\n  903&nbsp;(2010) (&quot;Under the two issue rule, where a decision\r\n  is based on more than one ground, the appellate court will affirm unless the\r\n  appellant appeals all grounds because the unappealed ground will become the law\r\n  of the case.&quot;).\r\nIn\r\n  any event, the evidence in the record weighs heavily in favor of the\r\n  reasonableness of the Town's proposed use of its easement.Â  The testimony shows\r\n  that Collier Beach Park will generate a much lower traffic intensity than would\r\n  a single family development in an &quot;RM-8&quot; residential building\r\n  district for which Collier Beach Park was zoned when the Town purchased it.Â \r\n  Therefore, Appellants' argument that the easement did not contemplate the\r\n  proposed increase in use must fail.Â  See Hill v. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co., 204 S.C. 83, 96, 28 S.E.2d 545, 549&nbsp;(1943)\r\n  (&quot;The unrestricted grant of an easement conveys all such rights as are\r\n  incident or necessary to its reasonable and proper enjoyment.&quot;); Plott\r\n    v. Justin Enters., 374\r\n  S.C. 504, 514, 649 S.E.2d 92, 96&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2007) (holding that the\r\n  character of an express easement is determined by the nature of the right and\r\n  the intention of the parties creating it).Â  \r\nLikewise, we find no merit to Appellants' argument that the master\r\n  implicitly recognized that the easement did not contemplate the proposed\r\n  increase in use when he ordered the Town to pay seventy-five percent of the\r\n  costs of maintaining the paved surface.Â  See Hayes\r\n    v. Tompkins, 287 S.C. 289,\r\n  294, 337 S.E.2d 888, 891&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1985) (&quot;Ordinarily, the owner of an easement has the duty to keep it in\r\n  repair.&quot;).Â  Therefore, the master\r\n  properly declined to find an unreasonable burden on the servient estate. \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTHOMAS,\r\n  PIEPER, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-552","title":"State v.

Mustian,\r\n          both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Appellants, Happy Rabbit, a South Carolina Limited\r\n  Partnership, and Carolyn Cook, brought this action against Respondent Alpine\r\n  Utilities, Inc. (Alpine) to recover damages for Alpine's alleged violations of section\r\n  27-33-50 of the South Carolina Code (2007), which prohibits utilities from\r\n  requiring landlords to execute an agreement to be responsible for charges\r\n  billed to premises leased by a tenant.Â  The circuit court denied Appellants'\r\n  motion for class certification and granted Alpine's motion to dismiss the\r\n  complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  Appellants seek review of both\r\n  orders.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nAppellants\r\n  maintain that the circuit court erred in dismissing their complaint when it failed to view the complaint's factual\r\n  allegations in the light most favorable to them.Â  Initially, we doubt that\r\n  section 27-33-50 creates a private right of action because it was not enacted\r\n  for the special benefit of Appellants, but rather for the benefit of the public\r\n  in general.Â  See Dema v. Tenet Physician\r\n    Servs.-Hilton Head, Inc., 383 S.C. 115,\r\n  121, 678 S.E.2d 430, 433&nbsp;(2009) (holding that where not expressly\r\n  provided, a private right of action may be created by implication only if the\r\n  legislation was enacted for the special benefit of a private party rather than\r\n  for the benefit of the public in general).Â Â  Â Â \r\nEven if a private right of\r\n  action could be asserted under section 27-33-50, we find a disparity between\r\n  the complaint's allegations and the specific actions the statute prohibits.Â  Section\r\n  27-33-50 prohibits a utility from requiring a landlord to sign a new contract to\r\n  be responsible for charges billed to premises leased by a tenant.Â  Yet the\r\n  complaint alleges that Appellants and Alpine were already in an existing\r\n  contractual relationship on the effective date of section 27-33-50 and that\r\n  Alpine would not let Appellants out of their contract.Â  Therefore, Appellants\r\n  have not stated facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for violation\r\n  of section 27-33-50. Â See S.C. Energy\r\n    Users Comm. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 388 S.C. 486, 491, 697 S.E.2d 587, 590 (2010) (&quot;A statute as a whole\r\n  must receive [a] practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant with\r\n  the purpose, design, and policy of lawmakers.&quot;) (internal quotation and\r\n  citation omitted); Brazell v. Windsor, 384 S.C. 512, 515, 682 S.E.2d 824,\r\n  826&nbsp;(2009) (holding that in deciding whether a trial court properly\r\n  granted a motion to dismiss, the appellate court must consider whether the\r\n  complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, states any\r\n  valid claim for relief).\r\nConcerning\r\n  Appellants' remaining exceptions, we affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and\r\n  the following authorities:\r\n1. As to whether the circuit court erred in dismissing Appellants'\r\n  complaint when it considered a potential defense outside the four corners of\r\n  the complaint:Â  Spence v. Spence, 368 S.C. 106, 124, 628 S.E.2d 869, 878\r\n  (2006) (approving of the assertion of a defense in a motion to dismiss when there\r\n  is no disputed issue of fact raised by the defense or when the facts are\r\n  completely disclosed on the face of the pleadings, and realistically nothing\r\n  further can be developed by pretrial discovery or a trial on the issue raised\r\n  by the defense).\r\n2. As to whether the circuit court\r\n  erred in dismissing Appellants' complaint when it failed to grant leave to\r\n  Appellants to file an amended complaint:Â  Spence, 368 S.C. at 130-31, 628 S.E.2d at 882 (holding that when\r\n  a complaint is dismissed with prejudice and the plaintiff is denied the\r\n  opportunity to file and serve an amended complaint yet fails to present\r\n  additional factual allegations or a different theory of recovery that may give\r\n  rise to a claim on which relief may be granted, the appellate court may, in its\r\n  discretion, affirm the dismissal of the complaint with prejudice); Kneece\r\n    v.

S.C. Budget &amp; Control\r\n    Bd. Div. of Gen. Servs. Info. Tech. Mgmt. Office, 346 S.C. 158, 165, 551 S.E.2d 263,\r\n  267&nbsp;(2001) (holding that when a dispute is not as to the underlying facts\r\n  but as to the interpretation of the law, and development of the record will not\r\n  aid in the resolution of the issues, it is proper to decide even novel issues\r\n  on a motion to dismiss).&nbsp;\r\n4. As to whether the circuit court erred in dismissing Appellants'\r\n  complaint when Alpine had not responded to Appellants' pending discovery\r\n  requests:Â  Sullivan Co. v. New Swirl, Inc., 313 S.C. 34, 36, 437 S.E.2d 30, 31&nbsp;(1993)\r\n  (&quot;Broad general statements of issues made by an appellant may be\r\n  disregarded by this Court.&quot;). \r\n5.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General\r\n          Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General Melody J. Brown, all of Columbia,\r\n          Jerry W. Peace, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Joseph Carl Haymes appeals his\r\n  convictions for murder, armed robbery, grand larceny, and possession of a\r\n  firearm during the commission of a violent crime.Â  Haymes argues the trial\r\n  judge erred in admitting (1) hearsay testimony from an investigator and (2) an\r\n  inculpatory statement Haymes made to law enforcement.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nHaymes knew the\r\n  victim, Billy Ray Adams, and was with Adams when he died.Â  When Haymes was\r\n  apprehended, he gave conflicting statements to law enforcement.Â  Haymes initially\r\n  claimed Adams' death was accidental, but later admitted in a written statement\r\n  he shot Adams because he was angry about having to pay Adams a court-ordered\r\n  debt in a breach of trust case involving automobiles. Â In a subsequent written\r\n  statement, Haymes maintained he shot Adams in self defense.Â  This was the\r\n  position Haymes asserted at trial. Â Haymes' appeal concerns the trial court's\r\n  admission of two statements that discredit this claim.\r\n1. Haymes first alleges error\r\n  in allowing Investigator John Murray to testify that in his efforts to locate\r\n  the pistol that Adams allegedly had on his person when Haymes shot him,\r\n  Murray's office &quot;checked with family members&quot; and &quot;[n]o family\r\n  members were aware of [Adams] every carrying 25 automatics.&quot; (Emphasis\r\n  added.) Â At trial, Haymes contended the statement was hearsay, but the trial\r\n  judge overruled the objection without further argument from counsel.\r\nIn response to\r\n  Haymes' argument that the testimony was inadmissible hearsay, the State argues (1)\r\n  the testimony was not an assertion that was admitted for the truth of the\r\n  matter asserted and (2) if testimony was hearsay and erroneously admitted, the\r\n  error is harmless because it was cumulative to evidence elicited by the defense\r\n  from Adams' brother.Â  We disagree with both assertions.Â  The State's first argument,\r\n  that the testimony was offered only to explain why law enforcement was not able\r\n  to find the pistol that Adams allegedly had with him when he died, does not\r\n  answer Haymes' argument that the statements Adams' family members allegedly\r\n  made to law enforcement directly contradicted Haymes' testimony that Adams always\r\n  kept a pistol in his jacket pocket and was armed at the time of the shooting.Â \r\n  As to whether the testimony was merely cumulative to other evidence, the\r\n  testimony cited by the State to support this argument came from Adams' brother,\r\n  who on cross-examination by the defense indicated he knew only that Adams had\r\n  some guns but did not know what kind they were. Â Unlike the testimony that\r\n  Haymes sought to exclude, this statement does not address the questions of\r\n  whether Adams was known to carry a gun on his person and whether he was armed\r\n  at the time of his death.\r\nNevertheless, we\r\n  hold the trial judge's refusal to suppress the disputed testimony was harmless\r\n  in view of overwhelming evidence of Haymes' guilt.Â  See State v.\r\n    Kilgore, 325 S.C. 188, 191-92, 480 S.E.2d 736, 737 (1997) (finding\r\n  &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; that even if the trial judge erred in\r\n  admitting certain testimony, the error did not contribute to the verdict in\r\n  view of &quot;overwhelming evidence&quot; of the defendant's guilt).Â  Haymes testified\r\n  before the jury that he shot Adams. Â There was undisputed forensic evidence\r\n  that Adams was struck from behind and shot in the back &quot;execution\r\n  style.&quot;Â  Haymes also gave conflicting accounts about Adams' death,\r\n  claiming first that it was accidental and later that it resulted from Haymes'\r\n  attempt to defend himself.Â  Furthermore, Haymes appropriated and sold items of\r\n  value belonging to Adams after killing him.Â  In contrast to a written statement\r\n  admitted without objection in which Haymes stated he sold Adams' pistol to an\r\n  acquaintance for $325, the acquaintance testified at trial that he purchased\r\n  only a shotgun and a rifle from Haymes and paid a total of only $200 for both\r\n  weapons. Â Finally, the issue of whether Adams was armed or known to carry a firearm\r\n  was not dispositive of Haymes' claim of self-defense, which required Haymes to\r\n  establish that (1) he was without fault in bringing on the difficulty, (2) he\r\n  actually believed he faced imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining\r\n  serious bodily injury, (3) a reasonable and prudent person of ordinary fitness\r\n  and courage would have entertained the same belief, and (4) he had no other\r\n  probable means of avoiding danger.Â  State v. Santiago, 370 S.C. 153,\r\n  159, 634 S.E.2d 23, 27 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Here, there was uncontroverted\r\n  evidence that Haymes was the initial aggressor and that Adams was attacked from\r\n  behind, which would indicate respectively that Haymes was at fault in bringing\r\n  on the difficulty and had other means of avoiding death or injury.\r\n2. Haymes next contends\r\n  the trial judge should not have admitted a written statement in which he\r\n  admitted he &quot;got pissed off&quot; at Adams because of some prior\r\n  litigation between the two.Â  He contended at trial and on appeal that he made\r\n  this statement after receiving defective Miranda warnings advising him\r\n  that (1) any statement he made could be used for or against him in court and\r\n  (2) if he could not afford a lawyer, he could apply to the court to have one\r\n  appointed for him without charge.[2]Â \r\n  We find no error in the admission of this statement.\r\n&quot;A waiver of Miranda rights is determined from the totality of the\r\n  circumstances.&quot;Â  State v. Tyson, 283 S.C. 375, 378, 323 S.E.2d 770,\r\n  771 (1984).Â  Full Miranda warnings that are understood by a suspect are\r\n  sufficient to &quot;negate any defect inÂ  . . . later warnings.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn support of his\r\n  argument that he is entitled to a new trial because of defective Miranda warnings, Haymes cites U.S. v. Connell, 869 F.2d 1349 (9th Cir. 1989), Groshart\r\n    v. U.S., 392 F.2d 172 (9th Cir. 1968), and Mayfield v. State, 736\r\n  S.W.2d 12 (1987).Â  In none of these cases, however, did the defendant receive\r\n  full Miranda warnings that would have overridden any inadequacies in\r\n  subsequent warnings.Â  Here, Haymes received an initial reading of Miranda rights that did not contain any of the flaws he contends tainted the warnings\r\n  at issue in this appeal.Â  This initial reading took place not more than one\r\n  hour before he received the warnings with the language that he claims mislead\r\n  him into making incriminating statements.Â  Haymes has not challenged the\r\n  constitutional sufficiency of the initial reading of his Miranda rights\r\n  or contended that his understanding of his rights was compromised by the\r\n  alleged deficiencies in the later readings. Â We, therefore, affirm the\r\n  admission of the disputed statement. \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, THOMAS,\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â Â  See Miranda v.

Sample, of Fort Mill, for\r\n          Appellant.\r\n        Matthew Summers Penn, of Columbia, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Windy Hill Orchard and Cider Mill, Inc. (Windy Hill) appeals from\r\n  the Administrative Law Court's (ALC) order that required it to cease all food\r\n  preparation, service, and sales, arguing the ALC erred in (1) requiring Windy\r\n  Hill to prove it fell within the permanent food stand exception that would\r\n  exempt it from the requirement to have a retail food establishment permit; (2)\r\n  finding doughnuts constituted a potentially hazardous food, thereby excluding\r\n  Windy Hill from the permanent food stand exception; (3) finding the production\r\n  of doughnuts at Windy Hill's orchard required more than minimal preparation,\r\n  thereby excluding Windy Hill from the permanent food stand exception; (4)\r\n  finding the one-time service of meatballs at a festival met the definition of a\r\n  retail food establishment and did not fall within the permanent food stand\r\n  exception; (5) finding Windy Hill violated Regulation 61-25 for a period of\r\n  forty-eight days when there was no substantial evidence in the record to\r\n  support such a finding; and (6) finding Windy Hill prepared and sold regulated\r\n  foods on twenty-four separate days during 2008, and basing its fine for\r\n  contempt on that number of days when there was no substantial evidence in the\r\n  record to support the finding.Â  We affirm\r\n  as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nWindy Hill is an\r\n  agrotourism business in York County, South Carolina.Â  Windy Hill makes apple\r\n  cider, apple butter, and cider doughnuts; provides educational tours of its\r\n  apple orchard; and allows customers to pick apples for purchase, observe\r\n  cider-making, and visit with farm animals.Â  Windy Hill also operates a roadside\r\n  market where it sells its cider, apple butter, and cider doughnuts, in addition\r\n  to other items it prepares including popcorn, apple pies, fried apple pies,\r\n  candy apples, pumpkin butter, strawberry butter, and drinks.Â  During its annual\r\n  Apple Harvest Festival in 2007, Windy Hill also prepared and served meatballs\r\n  coated in its apple-butter barbeque sauce.Â  Windy Hill's business is seasonal,\r\n  and in 2007, it operated from August to Christmas.\r\nFred Gusmer,\r\n  founder and chief executive officer of Windy Hill, testified he makes the apple\r\n  cider doughnuts from a dry mix to which he adds water and apple cider, and\r\n  mixes the ingredients in a large mixing bowl.Â  He then pours the mixture into a\r\n  doughnut hopper that cuts the doughnuts into the frying oil.Â  After the\r\n  doughnuts are cooked, the conveyor drops the doughnuts onto a carousel to\r\n  cool.Â  He said about half of the doughnuts are then dipped in cinnamon and sugar.Â \r\n  Gusmer estimated they made about thirty-five dozen doughnuts per hour, six days\r\n  a week.Â  To make Windy Hill's apple butter meatballs, Gusmer testified he purchases\r\n  pre-made, pre-cooked frozen meatballs.Â  The meatballs are heated in a steam\r\n  kettle with Windy Hill's apple-butter barbeque sauce, and transferred to a crock-pot\r\n  to keep warm until they are served.\r\nAlthough Windy\r\n  Hill was preparing food at its facility, it did not have a retail food\r\n  establishment permit as required by\r\n  Regulation 61-25 for &quot;any operation that prepares, packages, serves,\r\n  processes, or otherwise provides food for human consumption, either on or off\r\n  the premises, regardless of whether there is a charge for the food.&quot;Â  24A\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-25(A)(26) (Supp. 2009).Â  In Fall 2005, Jerlyn Greulich, a South Carolina Department\r\n  of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) restaurant inspector, testified she\r\n  stopped at Windy Hill because she smelled food cooking as she was driving past\r\n  the business.Â  She asked Gusmer what he was cooking and if she could see where\r\n  he was cooking it.Â  Gusmer declined her request, and she left without seeing\r\n  the facility. \r\nAfter speaking\r\n  with her supervisor about Windy Hill, Greulich returned to the business on\r\n  November 8, 2006 with her senior inspector.Â  They asked to speak with the\r\n  owner, but an employee told them he was busy, so they left a card with a\r\n  message for Gusmer to call DHEC.Â  Greulich again visited Windy Hill on May 17,\r\n  2007 to attend a meeting with Gusmer, an employee from the Department of\r\n  Agriculture (DOA), and Ken Beaty, Greulich's supervisor.Â  During the visit,\r\n  Greulich was able to inspect the facility and left Gusmer with a list of things\r\n  he needed to do to get his business permitted as a retail food establishment. \r\nWhen Gruelich received\r\n  complaints that Windy Hill was making and selling food, she contacted Beaty and\r\n  Bill Phillips, the county supervisor for DHEC. Â Phillips told her he spoke to\r\n  someone at Windy Hill who informed him all its food was prepackaged, so a\r\n  permit was not required.Â  Greulich contacted Beaty again on October 20, 2007,\r\n  after receiving more complaints about Windy Hill, and Beaty observed employees\r\n  cooking doughnuts when he visited the business.Â  As a result, Beaty asked\r\n  Greulich to write Windy Hill an official notice to stop cooking without a\r\n  permit.Â  Specifically, DHEC asserted Windy Hill was required to have a permit\r\n  for making its cider doughnuts and meatballs.Â  Greulich testified Gusmer and\r\n  his wife refused to take or sign the notice. \r\nGreulich returned\r\n  to Windy Hill with Beaty on October 25, 2007, in response to another\r\n  complaint.Â  They again observed Windy Hill cooking doughnuts in violation of\r\n  the first notice.Â  As a result, Greulich wrote Gusmer a second official notice\r\n  to stop making doughnuts without a permit, and the Gusmers again refused to\r\n  sign the notice.Â  The next day, Gusmer requested a meeting with DHEC to discuss\r\n  the notices.Â  Greulich testified Gusmer said &quot;he hoped that [DHEC] could\r\n  reduce the damages that [it] . . . were [sic] inflicting against his business\r\n  which had been in operation since 1991,&quot; and Gusmer &quot;tried to\r\n  persuade us that he did not need a permit to sell his foods.&quot;Â  Beaty\r\n  testified he twice attempted to give Gusmer a letter explaining the requirement\r\n  to obtain a permit, but Gusmer refused to take it.Â  Greulich again observed\r\n  Windy Hill making doughnuts on October 29 and 31, 2007.Â  When Greulich and\r\n  Beaty visited Windy Hill during its Apple Harvest Festival on October 20, 2007,\r\n  they also observed Windy Hill serving meatballs.\r\nGusmer claimed\r\n  Windy Hill qualified as a permanent food stand; therefore, it was not required\r\n  to obtain a permit.Â  Tamara Gordon, DHEC Chief Survey Officer,[1] testified a facility must meet two\r\n  requirements to qualify as a permanent food stand: (1) minimal preparation of\r\n  food, and (2) food that is non-potentially hazardous.Â  She said popcorn,\r\n  candied apples, french fries, and cotton candy are all minimal preparation food\r\n  items.Â  She explained: \r\n\r\n  There is no preparation to pop [a] corn kernel.Â  You put it in\r\n    grease and you fry it and you serve it immediately.Â  You take [a] candied\r\n    apple, you mix sugar and water, again, sugar and water is liking [sic] to\r\n    grease, and is not potentially hazardous.Â  You take an apple, put a stick in\r\n    it, add coloring over here, no big deal, dip it in, put it aside. . . . The\r\n    French fries, is [sic] from a bag frozen, you have [a] vat of grease, you take\r\n    it and you dump it in the grease and you fry it, and you bring it up and you\r\n    serve it immediately.Â  The cotton candy is the same way.Â  You pour sugar into a\r\n    spinning machine and you stick a single-service item in there and you end up\r\n    with [a] fluff ball of spun sugar.\r\n\r\nWhen asked about\r\n  Regulation 61-25, subpart 26(C)(12), Beaty explained DHEC permits facilities\r\n  that make pretzels, but it does not regulate facilities that just warm the\r\n  pretzels, like a stand at a ballgame.Â  Greulich testified &quot;minimal\r\n  preparation&quot; involved one bowl and one utensil.Â  Gordon stated anything\r\n  that requires cutting, mixing, or extensive equipment would not qualify as a\r\n  minimal preparation food.Â  As an example, she explained melting chocolate for a\r\n  mold, and scooping ice cream do not qualify as minimal preparation foods and\r\n  require a permit.Â  Gordon and Beaty both testified the dry doughnut mix used by\r\n  Gusmer contained egg and dairy products that when rehydrated would become a\r\n  potentially hazardous food.Â  Gordon stated DHEC has a policy that dry milk\r\n  batter is a potentially hazardous product that must be temperature controlled.Â \r\n  Gordon concluded Windy Hill's doughnuts do not qualify as a minimal-preparation\r\n  food, and the doughnut mix is a potentially hazardous product; therefore, Windy\r\n  Hill does not qualify as a permanent food stand and is required to have a\r\n  permit.Â  Gordon also mentioned Krispy Kreme Doughnuts has a DHEC permit.\r\nDHEC issued an\r\n  administrative order on November 2, 2007, requiring Windy Hill to cease food\r\n  preparation and service, or obtain a permit to operate as a retail food\r\n  establishment pursuant to South Carolina Regulation 61-25.Â  The order also\r\n  imposed a civil penalty of $5,000 and set penalties for future violations of\r\n  the order at $1,000 per day.Â  DHEC eventually determined Windy Hill owed $56,000\r\n  in civil penalties. \r\nGusmer wrote a\r\n  letter to DHEC requesting a final review, which DHEC denied.Â  Windy Hill filed\r\n  a request for a contested case hearing before the ALC, challenging DHEC's\r\n  November 2, 2007 order.Â  After numerous continuances, a hearing was held on\r\n  November 24, 2008.Â  The ALC filed its order on January 13, 2009, finding\r\n  &quot;Windy Hill must cease all food service operations until it obtains a Reg.\r\n  61-25 permit from [DHEC], must pay a civil penalty to [DHEC] in the amount of\r\n  [$24,000], and must pay a sanction to the [ALC] in the amount of\r\n  [$12,000].&quot;[2]Â \r\n  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe ALC presides over all\r\n  hearings of contested DHEC permitting cases and, in such cases, serves as the\r\n  fact-finder and is not restricted by the findings of the administrative\r\n  agency.Â  Terry v.

Code Ann. Â§ 44-1-140(2) (2002).Â  Pursuant\r\n  to its authority granted by the statute, DHEC adopted Regulation 61-25.Â  24A\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-25 (Supp. 2009).Â  Regulation 61-25 applies to retail\r\n  food establishments and defines a retail food establishment in Chapter I as:Â \r\n  &quot;any operation that prepares, packages, serves, processes, or otherwise\r\n  provides food for human consumption, either on or off the premises, regardless\r\n  of whether there is a charge for the food.&quot;Â  24A S.C. Code Ann. Regs.\r\n  61-25(A)(26) (Supp. 2009).Â  Chapter XIV(A) of Regulation 61-25 provides that\r\n  &quot;[n]o person shall operate a retail food establishment who does not have a\r\n  permit issued by the health authority.&quot;Â  However, Regulation\r\n  61-25(A)(26)(c) lists eighteen establishments that do not qualify as a retail\r\n  food establishment.Â  Windy Hill claimed it qualified under the &quot;permanent\r\n  food stand exception.&quot;Â  Subsection (c)(12) states permanent food stands\r\n  &quot;serve nonpotentially hazardous food which requires minimal or no\r\n  preparation including pretzels, popcorn, sno-cones, cotton candy, candy apples,\r\n  french fries, soft drinks, draft beer, and similar food.&quot;Â  24A S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Regs. 61-25(A)(26)(c)(12) (Supp. 2009).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nDuring the administrative hearing, Judge Kittrell\r\n  stated, &quot;in an enforcement action, the burden is on [DHEC] and they have\r\n  to establish a prima facie case and then the burden can shift over to [Windy\r\n  Hill].Â  That's the way these matters have been determined and it's been\r\n  outlined by decisional law in this State that way.&quot;Â  Gordon testified the\r\n  burden was on Windy Hill to prove to DHEC that its food qualifies under the exception.Â \r\n  Windy Hill correctly asserts that under Administrative Law Court Rule 29(B),\r\n  DHEC bore the burden of proof to establish Windy Hill met the definition of a\r\n  retail food establishment because it sought a civil penalty against Windy\r\n  Hill.Â  Rule 29(B), SCALC.Â  However, Windy Hill also asserts DHEC had to prove Windy Hill did not fall within\r\n  the permanent food stand exception, which would exempt it from the requirement\r\n  of a retail food establishment permit.\r\nWindy Hill relies on State v. Solomon, 245 S.C.\r\n  550, 141 S.E.2d 818 (1965), in support of its assertion that the party relying\r\n  on a statute is required to prove the opposing party's conduct does not fall\r\n  within the exception.&nbsp; In Solomon, the court determined that if the\r\n  exception does not form a part of the description of the offense, then it is a\r\n  defense.&nbsp; Id. at 564, 141 S.E.2d at 826.&nbsp; Therefore, the court\r\n  held that after the State had made its prima face case that Solomon had violated\r\n  the statute, the burden of proof shifted to Solomon to prove his work came\r\n  within the exceptions of the statute.&nbsp; Id. at 575-76, 141 S.E.2d at\r\n  832 (mentioning Charleston Oil Co. v. Poulnot, 143 S.C. 283, 296, 141\r\n  S.E. 454, 458 (1928) (discussing that a seller charged with the violation of\r\n  the statute bears the burden of showing the necessity of selling those articles\r\n  on Sunday)); see also State v. Attardo, 263 S.C. 546, 552, 211\r\n  S.E.2d 868, 871 (1975) (&quot;It is also well established in case law that when\r\n  the State has made out a prima facie case under a statute and the defendant\r\n  claims to fall within an 'exception' or 'proviso' in the statute the burden is\r\n  on the defendant to establish such a defense.&quot;); cf. TNS Mills,\r\n    Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 618, 503 S.E.2d 471, 475\r\n  (1998) (&quot;The burden is on claimants to prove their rights to an exemption\r\n  by bringing themselves clearly within the conditions imposed by the\r\n  statute.&quot;).&nbsp; Although Solomon is a criminal case, we find its\r\n  holding is also applicable in this case to determine the burdens of proof under Regulation 61-25.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, DHEC met its burden of proof by\r\n  establishing Windy Hill met the definition of a retail food establishment\r\n  because it prepared, packaged, served, processed, or otherwise provided food\r\n  without a permit.Â  It was then Windy Hill's burden to rebut DHEC's\r\n  determination that Windy Hill was a retail food establishment by establishing\r\n  it qualifies under the permanent food stand exception.Â  In response to Windy\r\n  Hill's assertion, DHEC further presented evidence that Windy Hill did not fall\r\n  within the exception because it prepared potentially hazardous food that\r\n  required more than minimal preparation.Â  Thus, we find the ALC did not err in\r\n  finding the burden was on DHEC to establish a prima facie case, and the burden\r\n  shifted to Windy Hill to prove it\r\n  fell within the permanent food stand exception.Â  \r\nII. Potentially\r\n  Hazardous Food\r\nWindy Hill argues the ALC\r\n  erred in finding its\r\n  doughnuts constituted a potentially hazardous food thereby excluding Windy Hill\r\n  from the permanent food stand exception.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nWindy Hill asserts DHEC\r\n  failed to produce any credible evidence that its doughnuts were a potentially\r\n  hazardous food.Â  Windy Hill also asserts determining doughnuts are a\r\n  potentially hazardous food requires the court to go beyond the plain meaning of\r\n  the regulation, and &quot;[u]nder the 'plain meaning rule,' it is not the\r\n  court's place to change the meaning of a clear and unambiguous statute.&quot;Â  S.C.\r\n    Coastal Conservation League v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control,\r\n  380 S.C. 349, 367, 669 S.E.2d 899, 908 (Ct. App. 2008), rev'd on other\r\n    grounds, Op. No. 26892 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Nov. 15, 2010) (Shearouse Adv.\r\n  Sh. No. 46 at 12).\r\nThis court will not substitute\r\n  its judgment for that of the ALC as to the weight of the evidence on questions\r\n  of fact unless the ALCâ€™s findings are clearly erroneous in view of the\r\n  reliable, probative, and substantial evidence in the record.Â  Comm'rs of\r\n    Pub. Works v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 372 S.C. 351, 358,\r\n  641 S.E.2d 763, 766-67 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  Further,\r\n  this court accords the most respectful consideration of the construction of a\r\n  statute by the agency charged with its administration and will not overrule it\r\n  absent compelling reasons.Â  Brown v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl.\r\n    Control, 348 S.C. 507, 515, 560 S.E.2d 410, 414 (2002) (quoting Dunton\r\n      v. S.C. Bd. of Exam'rs in Optometry, 291 S.C. 221, 223, 353 S.E.2d 132, 133\r\n  (1987)).\r\nGordon, whose job\r\n  involves writing policies and interpreting regulations, and Beaty both\r\n  testified the dry doughnut mix used by Windy Hill contained egg and dairy\r\n  products that would become a potentially hazardous food when rehydrated.Â  Gordon\r\n  stated DHEC has a policy that dry milk batters are considered a potentially hazardous\r\n  product that has to be temperature controlled.Â  Therefore, we find the evidence supports the ALC's finding that Windy Hill's doughnuts\r\n  constitute a potentially hazardous food, which excludes Windy Hill from the\r\n  permanent food stand exception.\r\nIII. Minimal\r\n  Preparation\r\nWindy Hill argues the ALC erred in finding the production of doughnuts at\r\n  Windy Hill's orchard required more than minimal preparation thereby excluding\r\n  Windy Hill from the permanent food stand exception.Â  We disagree.\r\nWindy Hill asserts DHEC failed to produce any evidence\r\n  that its doughnuts did not meet the minimal or no preparation requirement of\r\n  the permanent food stand exception.Â  Windy Hill argues again that determining whether a\r\n  food meets the minimal-preparation prong of the permanent food stand exception\r\n  requires the court to go beyond the plain meaning of the regulation.Â  It claims\r\n  the plain and obvious interpretation of the regulation is that whatever goes\r\n  into making a pretzel, candy apple, french fries, and the other listed foods,\r\n  constitutes minimal or no preparation, and there is no reason for the court to\r\n  read into the regulation an additional element that only prepackaged frozen\r\n  food fits into the exception for a permanent food stand.Â  Â \r\nAgain, this court will not substitute our judgment for\r\n  that of the ALC as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact unless\r\n  the ALCâ€™s findings are clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative,\r\n  and substantial evidence in the record.Â  Comm'rs of Pub. Works, 372 S.C.\r\n  at 358, 641 S.E.2d at 766-67. Â Also, this\r\n  court accords the most respectful consideration of the construction of a\r\n  statute by the agency charged with its administration and will not overrule it\r\n  absent compelling reasons.Â  Brown, 348 S.C. at 515, 560 S.E.2d at 414.\r\nGordon testified\r\n  popcorn, candied apples, french fries, and cotton candy are all minimal\r\n  preparation food items because they do not involve any, or very limited\r\n  preparation.Â  She stated anything that requires cutting, mixing, or extensive\r\n  equipment would not qualify as a minimal-preparation food.Â  For example, she\r\n  explained melting chocolate for a mold, and scooping ice cream do not qualify\r\n  as minimal preparation foods and require a permit.Â  Greulich testified minimal\r\n  preparation uses one bowl and one utensil.Â  Beaty explained that DHEC permits\r\n  facilities that make pretzels, but it does not regulate facilities that just\r\n  warm the pretzels, like a stand at a ballgame.Â  Gordon mentioned Krispy Kreme Doughnuts\r\n  has a DHEC permit.\r\nGusmer testified\r\n  he made the apple cider doughnuts from a dry mix to which he added water and\r\n  apple cider, and mixed the ingredients in a large mixing bowl.Â  He then poured\r\n  the mixture into a doughnut hopper, which cut the doughnuts into the frying\r\n  oil, and the conveyor dropped the doughnuts onto a carousel to cool after the\r\n  doughnuts were cooked.Â  Additionally, he dipped half of the doughnuts in\r\n  cinnamon and sugar.Â  Thus, we find the evidence\r\n  supports the ALC's finding\r\n  the production of doughnuts at Windy Hill's orchard required more than minimal\r\n  preparation, which excluded Windy Hill from the permanent food stand exception.\r\nIV. Retail Food\r\n  Establishment\r\nWindy Hill argues the ALC\r\n  erred in finding the one-time\r\n  service of meatballs at a festival met the definition of a retail food\r\n  establishment and did not fall within the permanent food stand exception.Â  We disagree.\r\nWindy Hill asserts it only\r\n  served meatballs on one day and that day was prior to DHEC's cease and desist\r\n  order.Â  Windy Hill essentially argues the meatballs, which are a regulated\r\n  food, are not subject to the regulation because they made them for one day only.Â \r\n  It raises this argument for the first time on appeal; therefore, it is not\r\n  preserved for our review.Â  Brown v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl.\r\n    Control, 348 S.C. 507, 519, 560 S.E.2d 410, 417 (2002) (&quot;Issues not\r\n  raised to and ruled upon by the ALJ are not preserved for appellate\r\n  consideration.&quot;).Â  \r\nWindy Hill also asserts DHEC\r\n  failed to produce any evidence that its meatballs were a potentially hazardous\r\n  food or required more than minimal preparation.Â  Gordon testified anything that requires mixing or extensive\r\n  equipment would not qualify as a minimal preparation food, and Greulich\r\n  testified that minimal preparation involved one bowl and one utensil.Â  As a\r\n  result, Windy Hill's meatballs would not qualify as a minimal-preparation food\r\n  because Gusmer testified he purchased pre-made, pre-cooked frozen meatballs,\r\n  which he heated in a steam kettle with apple-butter barbeque sauce, and\r\n  transferred to a crock-pot to keep warm until they were served.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  find the evidence supports the ALC's finding the production of meatballs at\r\n  Windy Hill's orchard required more than minimal preparation.\r\nV. Forty-Eight Day\r\n  Violation\r\nWindy Hill argues the ALC\r\n  erred in finding Windy Hill\r\n  violated Regulation 61-25 for a period of forty-eight days when there was no\r\n  substantial evidence in the record to support such a finding, and the court\r\n  improperly shifted the burden to Windy Hill to show it did not serve foods that\r\n  allegedly violated the regulation on that number of days.Â  We disagree.\r\nWindy Hill\r\n  asserts the ALC improperly shifted the burden to Windy Hill to prove the number\r\n  of days it served the foods that violated the regulation by adopting DHEC's\r\n  position that the fines accrued daily without further inspections to verify the\r\n  violation was continuing, unless it notified DHEC it was no longer in\r\n  violation. \r\nOn January 7,\r\n  2008, DHEC determined Windy Hill had been in operation in 2007 for a total of fifty-six\r\n  days, and at a fine of $1,000 per day, DHEC calculated the total penalty was\r\n  $56,000.Â  Gusmer testified Windy Hill was open in 2007 from August to December,\r\n  Monday through Saturday, with the exception of closing for rain or personal\r\n  business.Â  He replied in the negative when asked if it was possible for him to\r\n  have been open more than fifty days in 2007.Â  Gusmer also testified some of the\r\n  days he sold doughnuts that were made off-site, and he estimated he sold the\r\n  pre-made doughnuts for forty-five days. \r\nJudge Kittrell\r\n  reduced DHEC's civil penalty from $56,000 to $24,000 because Gusmer testified\r\n  Windy Hill was only open six days a week from October 27, 2007 to December 22,\r\n  2007.Â  Judge Kittrell determined there were fifty-six days between October 27\r\n  to December 22; subtracted the eight Sundays between the dates Windy Hill\r\n  opened and closed; and reduced the per-day penalty amount from $1,000 to $500.Â \r\n  Although Judge Kittrell already reduced the penalty by $32,000, Gusmer testified\r\n  he sold pre-made doughnuts for forty-five of the forty-eight days Windy Hill\r\n  was open in 2007.Â  Thus, the evidence presented is that Windy Hill was only in\r\n  violation of the regulation for three days, which would result in a $1,500 fine.Â \r\n  Therefore, we reduce Windy Hill's civil penalty to $1,500.\r\nVI. Fine for Contempt\r\nWindy Hill argues the ALC\r\n  erred in finding Windy Hill\r\n  prepared and sold regulated foods on twenty-four separate days during 2008 and\r\n  basing its fine for contempt on that number of days when there was no\r\n  substantial evidence in the record to support this finding.Â  We disagree.\r\nWindy Hill asserts there is\r\n  no substantial evidence in the record as to how many days Windy Hill violated\r\n  the August 11, 2008 order that lifted the automatic stay of the DHEC order to\r\n  cease and desist making food without a permit.Â  Windy Hill maintains only seventeen\r\n  days passed from the date Windy Hill opened, August 23, 2008, and September 8,\r\n  2008, when Windy Hill notified DHEC it had stopped making the doughnuts.Â \r\n  Further, Gusmer claims that normally Windy Hill is closed on Sundays.Â  Windy\r\n  Hill does not dispute it made doughnuts in violation of the order; therefore,\r\n  the ALC did not err in finding Windy Hill in contempt of court.Â  However, as\r\n  Windy Hill asserts, there were only fourteen days between August 23 and\r\n  September 8 that Windy Hill would have been open for business.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  find Windy Hill should only be sanctioned for the fourteen days it operated in\r\n  violation of the order.Â  Judge Kittrell assessed a $500 per-day sanction for twenty-four\r\n  days, for a total of $12,000.Â  Had Judge Kittrell only sanctioned Windy Hill\r\n  for fourteen days, the total sanction would be $7,000.Â  Therefore, we reduce Windy Hill's sanction\r\n  to $7,000.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, we\r\n  affirm the ALC's order with reductions in\r\n  the penalties and sanctions against Windy Hill.\r\nAFFIRMED AS\r\n  MODIFIED.\r\nFEW, C.J.,\r\n  SHORT and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Gordon testified that in addition to conducting\r\n  audits of the regional inspectors, she also assists the Director of DHEC's\r\n  Division of Food Protection in writing policies and interpreting regulations\r\n  that are implemented statewide. \r\n[2]Â  Judge Kittrell reduced DHEC's civil penalty from\r\n  $56,000 to $24,000.\r\n[3] These sections can now be found in S.C.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General\r\n          Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General Julie M. Thames, all of Columbia;\r\n          and Solicitor Robert M. Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Rip\r\n  Patrick Bryant appeals his conviction for assault and battery of a high and aggravated\r\n  nature (ABHAN), arguing the trial court erred in (1) denying his motion for a\r\n  continuance due to an illegally and irregularly impaneled jury and (2) denying\r\n  his motion for a jury instruction on the lesser included offense of simple\r\n  assault and battery. Â Â We affirm.[1]\r\n1. Bryant argues\r\n  the trial court committed reversible error in denying his motion for a\r\n  continuance.Â  We disagree.Â  &quot;The conduct of a criminal trial is left\r\n  largely to the sound discretion of the trial judge, who will not be reversed in\r\n  the absence of a prejudicial abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  State v. Bryant,\r\n  372 S.C. 305, 312, 642 S.E.2d 582, 586 (2007).Â  Notably, &quot;a trial court is given\r\n  enormous discretion in conducting a criminal trial.&quot;Â  Id. at 313,\r\n  642 S.E.2d at 587. Â Moreover, &quot;'the [statutory] provisions as to the\r\n  drawing and summoning of jurors are usually .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not\r\n  mandatory.'&quot;Â  State v. Smith, 200 S.C. 188, 196, 20 S.E.2d 726, 730\r\n  (1942) (quoting State v. Rasor, 168 S.C. 221, 233, 167 S.E. 396, 401\r\n  (1933)).Â  Section 14-7-1100 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (Supp. 2009) requires that jurors in criminal cases be impaneled\r\n  according to &quot;established practice,&quot; but &quot;'established\r\n  practice' does not refer to only one method of impaneling a jury&quot; and the\r\n  court need not use the &quot;most common&quot; method of impaneling. Â Bryant,\r\n  372 S.C. at 313, 642 S.E.2d at 587 (internal quotations omitted).Â  If there is an\r\n  irregularity in the impaneling of jurors, that irregularity is insufficient to\r\n  set aside a verdict unless a party objected before the returning of the verdict\r\n  and the irregularity injured the objecting party. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1140\r\n  (Supp. 2009).Â  Thus, a defendant is not entitled to a full jury venire so long\r\n  as a sufficient number of jurors remain from which to draw the jury.Â  State\r\n    v. Rogers, 263 S.C. 373, 382, 210 S.E.2d 604, 609 (1974).Â  \r\nHere, the trial court did not\r\n  abuse its discretion in impaneling jurors after qualification by drawing the\r\n  present jurors' badges from a box.Â  The jury was not illegally impaneled because\r\n  the procedures for drawing and impaneling jurors generally are not mandatory. Â Bryant, 372 S.C. at\r\n  313, 642 S.E.2d at 587; Smith, 200 S.C. at 196, 20 S.E.2d at 730.Â  Bryant did not argue at trial that the method\r\n  used was against established practice, and he failed to present evidence that\r\n  the method prevented him from receiving a fair trial by an impartial jury. Â Although\r\n  the jury was not illegally impaneled, the jury was irregularly impaneled\r\n  because an erroneous phone message left by the court caused nineteen of the\r\n  fifty-three qualified jurors to be absent for impaneling.Â  Despite the reduced\r\n  number of present jurors, however, the irregularity did not prejudice Bryant.Â \r\n  He was not entitled to a full jury venire, and\r\n  he produced no relevant evidence that the remaining jury pool was tainted.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the trial court properly denied Bryant's objections to the jury impaneling. Â \r\n2. Bryant next\r\n  argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for a jury instruction on the lesser included offense of simple\r\n  assault and battery. Â We disagree.Â  &quot;To warrant reversal, a trial court's refusal to give a\r\n  requested jury charge must be both erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant.&quot;Â  State v. Gaines, 380 S.C. 23, 31, 667\r\n  S.E.2d 728, 732&nbsp;(2008).Â  A trial court properly &quot;refus[es] to\r\n  charge a lesser included offense where there is no evidence tending to show the\r\n  defendant was guilty only of the lesser offense.&quot;Â  State v. White, 361\r\n  S.C. 407, 412, 605 S.E.2d 540, 542 (2004).Â  &quot;ABHAN\r\n  is an unlawful act of violent injury accompanied by circumstances of\r\n  aggravation.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.Â  Circumstances of aggravation include\r\n  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. great disparity in the ages or physical conditions of the\r\n  parties, [and] a difference in gender&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;Â  Id. at 412, 605 S.E.2d at 543 (internal quotations and citations omitted).Â  &quot;Simple assault and battery is an unlawful act of\r\n  violent injury to another, unaccompanied by any circumstances of aggravation.&quot;Â  Id. at 413, 605 S.E.2d at 543 (emphasis in original).Â  \r\nHere, the record provides\r\n  evidence that Bryant was not guilty of only simple assault and battery.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the trial court properly denied Bryant's motion for a jury instruction on simple\r\n  assault and battery as a lesser included offense of ABHAN.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTHOMAS, PIEPER, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-568","title":"Hinson v.

Boyd, of Rock Hill, for Appellant.\r\n        Brian Scott McCoy, of Rock Hill, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Robert Hinson appeals the order from a bench trial\r\n  finding that the Stafford Park Homeowners Association's (Stafford Park) bylaws\r\n  materially complied with the Declaration of Covenants and the statutes of this\r\n  State.Â  As such, the court found that Stafford Park's Board of Directors was\r\n  properly elected and its members acted within the scope of their office and in\r\n  furtherance of the association's affairs when they assessed fees and filed a\r\n  lien of foreclosure on Hinson's property.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nHinson asserts that Stafford Park did not have the power to set and assess fees\r\n  because bylaws conforming to the Restrictive Covenants were never properly\r\n  placed into effect.Â  He also asserts that Stafford Park lacked the power to\r\n  assess member fees because the common areas and amenities were not owned by\r\n  Stafford Park before 2005.Â  As Hinson cites no authority to support the\r\n  reversal of the trial court's ruling on these issues, we find them\r\n  abandoned on appeal.Â  See Rule 208(b)(1)(D) SCACR (&quot;[T]he particular\r\n  issue to be addressed shall be set forth in distinctive type, followed by\r\n  discussion and citations of authority.&quot;); First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (considering an issue abandoned because the appellant\r\n  failed to provide pertinent argument or supporting authority); Jones v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 384\r\n  S.C. 295, 317, 682 S.E.2d 282, 294 (Ct. App. 2009) (deeming an issue abandoned\r\n  on appeal if the argument is conclusory and unsupported by authority); Bennett\r\n    v. Investors Title Ins. Co., 370 S.C. 578, 599, 635 S.E.2d 649, 660 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2006) (noting an issue is abandoned on appeal when the appellant fails to\r\n  cite any supporting authority for his position and makes only conclusory\r\n  arguments). \r\nAs to whether the circuit court erred in holding Stafford Park's officers were validly elected and had\r\n  the authority to maintain and assess member fees in accordance with the\r\n  Restrictive Covenants, Stafford Park's bylaws, and the statutes of this State,\r\n  we affirm.Â  Section 6.3(a) of the Restrictive Covenants states that Stafford\r\n  Park's bylaws shall provide for &quot;[t]he control of the Association by a\r\n  Board of no less than five Directors who shall be elected by simple majority\r\n  vote of the [o]wners present . . . at an annual meeting called for such purpose\r\n  at which a simple majority shall constitute a quorum.&quot;Â  The Stafford Park\r\n  Homeowners Association By-Laws Section II.F. explains how a quorum is formed\r\n  (using the joinder method) to reach a simple majority.Â  It states, &quot;[t]he\r\n  joinder of a member in the action of a meeting by signing and concurring in the\r\n  minutes thereof shall constitute the presence of such member for the purpose of\r\n  determining a quorum.&quot;Â  Although there is no South Carolina case law\r\n  specifically on point, section 33-31-140(1)(a) of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (2006) states that members entitled to vote on an issue may approve it by the\r\n  &quot;affirmative vote of a majority of the votes of the members represented\r\n  and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present or the\r\n  affirmative vote of the greater proportion . . . of the members . . . as the .\r\n  . .Â  bylaws . . . may provide . . . .&quot;Â  Section 33-31-140(1)(b) enables a\r\n  member to approve a vote by &quot;a written ballot or written consent in\r\n  conformity with this chapter.&quot;Â  Thus, the joinder method of achieving a\r\n  quorum to attain a majority vote as stated in Stafford Park's bylaws comports\r\n  with the Restrictive Covenants and the statutes of this State.Â  Â Â \r\nRegarding the\r\n  assessment of fees, section 33-31-302(15) of the South Carolina Code (2006)\r\n  states in part, &quot;[E]very corporation has . . . the same powers as an\r\n  individual . . . to do all things necessary or convenient to carry out its\r\n  affairs including, without limitation, power . . . to impose dues, assessments,\r\n  and admission and transfer fees upon it members . . . .&quot; Â Section 7.1 of\r\n  the Restrictive Covenants also provides &quot;[a]ll covenants, restrictions, and affirmative obligations set forth in\r\n  this Declaration shall run with the land and shall be binding upon all persons,\r\n  firms, and corporations owning any interest in the lands now or hereafter\r\n  affected by the Declaration . . . .&quot;Â  The language of Stafford Park\r\n  Homeowners Association By-laws Section IV.A.1. states in part: \r\n\r\n  [E]ach member is deemed to covenant and [to] agree to\r\n    pay . . . to the Association, annual assessments or charges, . . . .Â  The\r\n    annual and special assessments, together with such interest thereon and costs\r\n    of collection thereof, as hereinafter provided shall be a charge on the land\r\n    and shall be a continuing lien upon the property against which each assessment\r\n    is made.Â  Each such assessment, together with such interest, costs and\r\n    reasonable attorney's fees shall also be the personal obligation of the person\r\n    who was the owner of such property at the time when the assessment fell due . .\r\n    . . Â \r\n\r\nPursuant to section 27-31-170\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (2007), &quot;[e]ach co&#8209;owner shall comply\r\n  strictly with the bylaws and with the administrative rules and regulations\r\n  adopted pursuant thereto . . . .&quot;; see also Cedar Cove Homeowners Ass'n, Inc. v. DiPietro, 368 S.C. 254, 270, 628\r\n  S.E.2d 284, 292 (Ct. App. 2006) (&quot;Restrictive\r\n  covenants often authorize the creation of a homeowners' association, usually in the form of a not-for-profit\r\n  corporation, and grant it authority to manage common areas, make regulations,\r\n  levy assessments, and other similar privileges.&quot;)\r\n  (citations omitted); Harbison Cmty. Ass'n, Inc. v. Mueller, 319 S.C. 99,\r\n  102, 459 S.E.2d 860, 862 (Ct.

As to whether the circuit court erred\r\n  in finding the identification procedure based on third party information was\r\n  not unduly suggestive and admitting the identification testimony: State v.\r\n    Moore, 343 S.C. 282, 287, 540 S.E.2d 445, 447 (2000) (holding a court must\r\n  first ascertain whether a confrontation procedure was unduly suggestive when\r\n  determining whether an in-court identification violates due process); State\r\n    v. Tisdale, 338 S.C. 607, 611-12, 527 S.E.2d 389, 392 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding\r\n  suggestiveness arising from nongovernmental sources does not violate due\r\n  process).\r\n2.

Weston, 367\r\n  S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006). Â A reviewing court must uphold the\r\n  denial of a directed verdict where &quot;there is any direct evidence or\r\n  substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of\r\n  the accused&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot; Â Id. at 292-93, 625 S.E.2d\r\n  at 648.Â  The reviewing court &quot;views the evidence and all reasonable\r\n  inferences in the light most favorable to the [S]tate.&quot; Â Id. at\r\n  292, 625 S.E.2d at 648.Â  \r\nUnder section\r\n  16-9-420 of the South Carolina Code (2003), &quot;[w]hoever aids or assists a\r\n  prisoner in escaping or attempting to\r\n  escape from an officer .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall be punished by imprisonment\r\n  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;Â  Generally, &quot;[a] defendant\r\n  may not be convicted of a criminal offense unless the State proves beyond a reasonable\r\n  doubt that he acted with the criminal intent .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. required for a particular\r\n  offense.&quot;Â  State v. Fennell, 340 S.C. 266, 271, 531 S.E.2d 512, 515\r\n  (2000).Â  &quot;The intent with which an act is done\r\n  denotes a state of mind, and can be proved only by expressions or conduct,\r\n  considered in the light of the given circumstances.&quot;Â  State v.

Â Whether a defendant\r\n  acted with the requisite criminal intent is ordinarily a question of fact for\r\n  the jury, unless no evidence of criminal intent exists. Â Id.\r\nViewed in the light most\r\n  favorable to the State, the State presented direct and substantial\r\n  circumstantial evidence that Brooks intended to help a suspect escape police\r\n  custody.Â  While police officers attempted to handcuff the suspect, Brooks accosted\r\n  and pushed the officers, interfering with their attempts&nbsp;to arrest the\r\n  suspect.Â  The suspect escaped, and one of the officers began to assess how to\r\n  pursue the suspect. Â Brooks immediately attacked that officer, punching him\r\n  twice.Â  Because of Brooks's conduct, the officer was unable to pursue the\r\n  suspect.Â  Therefore, the State presented direct and substantial circumstantial\r\n  evidence reasonably tending to prove that Brooks intended to help the suspect\r\n  escape police custody.Â  Accordingly, the trial court properly denied Brooks's\r\n  motion for a directed verdict.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTHOMAS, PIEPER, and\r\n  GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-571","title":"State v.

Ariail, of Greenville, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Barbara\r\n  Wright appeals her conviction for filing a false police report, arguing the\r\n  trial court erred by (1) including in the jury instructions the statement that\r\n  armed robbery is a felony and (2) denying her motion for a directed verdict.Â  We\r\n  affirm.[1]\r\n1. Wright argues the\r\n  trial court erred by including in the jury instructions a statement that armed\r\n  robbery is a felony because, by doing so, the trial court violated the South Carolina\r\n  Constitution.Â  We disagree.Â  Article V, section 21 of the South Carolina\r\n  Constitution states, &quot;Judges shall not charge juries in respect to matters\r\n  of fact, but shall declare the law.&quot;Â  Armed robbery's status as a felony\r\n  is a matter of law rather than fact.Â  Accordingly, the trial court properly instructed the jury on that issue.\r\n2. Wright next argues the trial court erred in denying\r\n  her motion for a directed verdict because the State failed to produce evidence\r\n  armed robbery was a felony to sustain the offense of filing a false police\r\n  report. Â We disagree.Â  A reviewing court must uphold the denial of a directed\r\n  verdict where &quot;there is any direct evidence or any substantial\r\n  circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the\r\n  accused&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;Â  State v. Weston, 367 S.C.\r\n  279, 292-93, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006).Â  The reviewing court views the\r\n  evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the state.Â  Id. at 292, 625 S.E.2d at 648. Â Section 16-17-722(A) of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (2003) provides, &quot;It is unlawful for a\r\n  person to knowingly file a false police report,&quot; and subsection\r\n  16-17-722(B) provides, &quot;A person who violates subsection (A) by falsely\r\n  reporting a felony is guilty of a felony and upon conviction must be imprisoned\r\n  for not more than five years or fined not more than one thousand dollars, or\r\n  both.&quot;Â  The armed robbery statute of the South Carolina Code states,\r\n  &quot;A person who commits robbery while armed with a .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. deadly\r\n  weapon .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is guilty of a felony .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;Â  S.C.\r\n  Code. Ann. Â§ 16-11-330(A) (2003).\r\nHere, the State presented testimony that Wright reported a\r\n  man robbed the store with a knife and signed a statement saying she lied that a\r\n  robbery occurred.Â  Therefore, the State presented sufficient evidence to\r\n  sustain the offense of filing a false police report, and the trial court\r\n  properly denied Wright's motion for a directed verdict. \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTHOMAS,\r\n  PIEPER, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
