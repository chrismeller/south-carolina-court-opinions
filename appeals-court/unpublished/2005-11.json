Causey, III, of Darlington, for Appellant.\r\n        Robert E. Lee, of Florence, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Richard W. Lee appeals the Special Refereeâ€™s decision that neither of the parties established legal title to the property in dispute.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1913, Mary E. Edwards sold the Wagner Siding Tract (the Tract) to the South Carolina Western Railway (the Railroad) for use as a landing to park and load railway cars.Â  The 1913 deed includes a habendum clause, which states â€œ[t]o have and to hold all and singular the said premises unto the said South Carolina Western Railway, its successors and Assigns forever; Upon condition, however, that the said premises shall be used for Railroad Purposes only.â€Â  The first evidence the Tract was not used for railroad purposes appeared in a 1963 plat, which describes the Tract area as a â€œRoad,â€ suggesting that sometime between 1916 and 1963 the Railroad discontinued its use of the Tract for â€œrailroad purposes.â€Â  \r\nRichard W. Lee claims ownership through a common predecessor in title with the Respondents in the name of J.H. Watson.Â  In 1980, the Railroad conveyed its interest in the Tract, if any, to Watson through a quitclaim deed.Â  Upon Watsonâ€™s death, the Tract passed to his Wife.Â  She subsequently sold the Tract to Lee.Â  \r\nAfter conveying the Tract to the Railroad, Edwards conveyed the remainder of her property to the Home Improvement Company.Â  Ultimately, Watson purchased the property once owned by Edwards.Â  Relying upon the 1963 plat, Watson conveyed a portion, which included the strip of land in dispute, to his son.Â  Watsonâ€™s son then conveyed that portion to L.H. Stokes, who conveyed it to H.S. Davis.Â  Davis devised the strip to his wife (Lou Davis) who sold the property to George M. Creel once litigation with Lee had begun.Â  \r\nIn 1998, Lee brought an action against Davis and Creel (Respondents), asking the court to require Respondents to remove all encroachments from Leeâ€™s property, to restrain and enjoin Respondents from any future encroachment, trespass, and interference with Leeâ€™s use and enjoyment of the property, to award Lee reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees, and to award Lee any other â€œjust, equitable, and properâ€ relief.Â  Respondentsâ€™ answered, claiming ownership of the property by title or adverse possession for a period of 20 years and further requesting the court to enjoin and restrain Lee from â€œcoming upon or about her property.â€ Â The disputed property is a 25â€™ by 210â€™ strip of land in Darlington County, which is situated in the Wagner Siding Tract.Â  \r\nBy consent of the parties, the matter was referred to a Special Referee who held an evidentiary hearing in February 2004, resulting in an order that rejected both partiesâ€™ claims to the disputed strip of land in the Tract.Â  According to the hearing transcript, before reference to the Special Referee, Judge Casey Manning signed an order on April 30, 1999 stating â€œthere exists a genuine issue of material fact as to the ownership of the property and grantorâ€™s ability to convey good title.â€Â  Moreover, the parties waived their rights to a jury trial.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAlthough Lee claims otherwise, the pleadings reflect that both parties claim ownership of the strip of land in question.Â  Therefore, the nature of the case is a trespass to try title action, which puts ownership of the Tract at issue.Â  Watson v. Suggs, 313 S.C. 291, 293, 437 S.E.2d 172, 173 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding that an action brought for the primary purpose of determining title to a disputed tract of land is in the nature of a trespass to try title).Â  An action for trespass to try title is an action at law.Â  Bodiford v. Spanish Oak Farms, Inc., 317 S.C. 539, 544, 455 S.E.2d 194, 197 (Ct. App. 1995) (holding a boundary line dispute to be an action at law); Clements v. Young, 310 S.C. 73, 74, 425 S.E.2d 63, 64 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  \r\nIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed unless found to be without evidence, which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.Â  Townes Assocs. Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  That the parties referred the case to a special referee does not change the scope of review, when, as here, the referee enters final judgment.Â  Leahy v. Starflo Corp., 314 S.C. 546, 548, 431 S.E.2d 567, 568 (1993).Â  We therefore must affirm the decision of the Special Referee if there is any evidence to support his determination that the disputed strip of land does not belong to either party.Â  \r\nLAW/ ANALYSIS\r\n&nbsp;\r\nLee claims the Special Referee erred in addressing the issue of ownership in his order because it was not a matter raised in the pleadings.Â  We disagree.\r\nBoth parties claim ownership of some portion of the Tract and request equitable intervention by the Special Referee to enjoin the opposing party from use of that portion.Â  The pleadings are postured in such a manner as to require the Special Referee to determine ownership before dealing with the location of the boundary line.Â  In a boundary line dispute, the court must determine the ownership of the land to determine who is entitled to occupancy thereof.Â  Watson v. Suggs, 313 S.C. 291, 294, 437 S.E.2d 172, 174 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  The resolution of that issue precluded any further discussion of the equitable issues.\r\nLee also claims the Special Referee erred in determining the Tract was owned by a third party.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Edwardsâ€™ deed provided the Railroad with a fee simple determinable with a possibility of reverter, if, or at such time as, the Railroad discontinued its use of the Tract for â€œrailroad purposes.â€Â  The first evidence the Tract was not used for railroad purposes appeared in a 1963 plat, which describes the Tract area as a â€œRoad,â€ suggesting that sometime between 1916 and 1963 the Railroad discontinued its use of the Tract for â€œrailroad purposes.â€Â  We find the Special Referee had sufficient evidence to determine that prior to 1980 the Railroad was divested of title to the Tract in issue.Â  At that point in time, title reverted to Edwards, if then living, or his heirs at law who were then living.Â  See Purvis v. McElveen, 234 S.C. 94, 100, 106 S.E.2d 913, 916 (1959) (â€œ[T]he whole estate will, upon the happening of the event of defeasance, pass, if the grantor be then dead, not to those who were his heirs at the time of his death, but to those who answer to the description of his heirs at the time of the termination of the estate granted.â€).Â  â€œAccordingly, the [R]ailroad could not have conveyed title to the Wagner Siding Tract to anyone following defeasance because, at that point in time, the [R]ailroad had nothing to convey.â€ (emphasis in original).Â  Therefore, Leeâ€™s claim to ownership of the disputed strip of land fails.Â  \r\nLee makes a rather detailed and somewhat confusing argument that an examination of various plats (some of which are either not in the record on appeal or not properly identified in the record) and deeds in the chain of title would clear up all uncertainties as to the boundary line.Â  Specifically, he argues that the 1975 deed to Creelâ€™s predecessor in title was ineffective to convey title to the disputed Tract because the Railroad still owned the Tract.Â  Additionally, he argues that in 1980 the Railroad conveyed the Tract to his predecessor in title.Â  Finally, he argues it is irrelevant whether he or some third party owns the Tract because title to the disputed Tract was not the subject of this litigation.Â  \r\nLeeâ€™s arguments are misplaced given our conclusion that title to the Tract was in issue and that prior to 1980 title to the Tract in dispute reverted to the then heirs at law of Edwards.Â  There can be no boundary line dispute when neither party to the action has title to the disputed property.Â  The Special Referee found the 1963 plat shows the Tract had been abandoned for â€œrailroad purposesâ€ prior to the date of the plat.Â  Because there is some evidence to support this finding, we must affirm the Special Referee.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the trial court is hereby \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, WILLIAMS, JJ., AND CURETON, A.J., CONCUR.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument, pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-577","title":"Pallanck v.

Coltrane, Special Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-577\r\nSubmitted October 1, 2005 â€“ Filed November 7, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        James H. Moss, of Beaufort; for Appellants.\r\n        David L. Tedder, of Beaufort; for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this action, Randall Pallanck, Sarah J. Pallanck, James R. Liles, Paul W. Donaldson, and David P. Howe (Appellants) allege the circuit court erred (1) in failing to find Robert Lemieux and Cathy Ann Lemieux (Lemieux) created a nuisance by damming the water on their property; (2) in finding Pallanck encroached into the easement along Alexander Way; and (3) in ordering Pallanck to remove the curb along Alexander Way.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThe parties own or once owned four adjacent lots located on Alexander Way, an unpaved, private right of way that is fifty feet in width.Â  The four lots are configured into a large, square subdivision, and each are approximately the same size.Â  The lots comprise the four quadrants of the subdivision with the Pallanck lot in the northwest quadrant, the Lemieux lot in the northeast quadrant, the Howe lot in the southeast quadrant[2], and the Liles lot in the southwest quadrant.Â  Alexander Way runs in a north-south direction and is centered on the property line dividing the Pallanck and Lemieux lots, and it provides access to all four lots.\r\nSeveral drainage easements also exist in the subdivision.Â  A thirty-foot drainage easement runs east-west between the boundary of the Pallanck and Liles lots and the Lemieux and Howe lots (the Pallanck-Howe easement).Â  Another thirty-foot drainage easement runs north-south along the eastern boundary of the Lemieux lot (the Lemieux easement).Â  In this drainage easement, there is an existing ditch that runs within the entire length of the Lemieux easement, and crosses the Liles-Howe easement.Â  The Lemieux lot also contains another ditch that runs along the western and southern boundaries of the property, and connects with the ditch in the Lemieux easement (the Lemieux ditch).Â  The Lemieux ditch is situated entirely within the Lemieux lot.Â  \r\nSometime in 1994, Lemieux built a pond on his lot, and also took steps to block the Lemieux ditch.Â  Thereafter, Pallanck placed curbing and poles along the portion of his lot that abuts Alexander Way in an attempt to divert or prevent surface waters from his lot. \r\nRecently, Alexander Way has become flooded, and the flooding is concentrated along the boundary between the Pallanck and Lemieux lots.Â  The flooding was severe enough to prevent access to the Liles and Howe lots, and at times rendered Alexander Way impassable.Â  \r\nThe Appellants claim the flooding resulted from the actions taken by Lemieux.Â  Specifically, the Appellants allege the pond built by Lemieux and the blocking of the Lemieux ditch caused surface waters to flood Alexander Way.Â  The Appellantsâ€™ complaint set forth a single cause of action alleging interference with certain easement rights related to drainage, and sought an injunction and damages.Â  Lemieux counterclaimed, alleging the actions of the Appellants caused the flooding of Alexander Way.Â  Lemieux sought an order enjoining any further interference by the Appellants.Â  Lemieux also sought an order compelling the Appellants to restore certain ditches, and sought to enjoin any further trespass onto their property.Â  \r\nOn August 11, 2001, the court issued an order for temporary injunction, prohibiting Lemieux from taking any action to interfere with, dam, barricade, or otherwise obstruct the â€œthirty foot drainage easement.â€Â  On August 14, 2001, the circuit court concluded that under the â€œcommon enemy ruleâ€ the actions of Lemieux did not amount to an actionable nuisance, and dismissed the claims of the Appellants.Â  The circuit court order also (1) permanently enjoined Appellants from further trespass onto the Lemieux lot; (2) ordered Pallanck to remove any curbing or poles that were within fifty feet of the Alexander Way easement; and (3) allowed Lemieux to take any action necessary to abate the flow of water onto their property from the pipe or culvert placed across Alexander Way by the Appellants.Â  This appeal followed.[3]\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  An action by a property owner seeking to enjoin the owner of adjoining property from violating zoning ordinances and alleging special damages is not an action to abate a private nuisance but is an ordinary suit in equity.Â  Momeier v. John McAlister, 193 S.C. 422, 8 S.E.2d 737 (1940).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;The â€œCommon Enemyâ€ Rule\r\nAppellants first argue the circuit court erred in failing to find the actions of Lemieux constituted a nuisance.Â  Specifically, Appellants contend the blocking of the Lemieux ditch and the creation of the pond diverted surface waters onto Alexander Way in violation of the easement.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn its order, the circuit court applied the â€œcommon enemyâ€ rule, which states:\r\n\r\n  The right of the owner of land to improve it, by changing its surface or erecting buildings and other structures on it, is not restricted merely because the improvement will cause surface water which naturally flows or accumulates on his land either to stand in unusual quantities on his neighborâ€™s adjacent lands or to pass onto and over them in greater quantities and in other directions than it was accustomed to flow.â€Â  \r\n\r\nJohnson v. Phillips, 315 S.C. 407, 412, 433 S.E.2d 895, 898 (Ct. App. 1993) (citing Baltzeger v. Carolina Midway Railway, 54 S.C. 242, 32 S.E. 358 (1899)).Â  â€œThe obstruction of surface water, or an alteration in its flow, affords no cause of action to a person who suffers loss or detriment therefrom against one who does not act inconsistent with the lawful exercise of dominion over his own soil.â€Â  Phillips, 315 S.C. at 412, 433 S.E.2d at 898-99.\r\nThe â€œcommon enemyâ€ rule has two exceptions.Â  First, the rule is subject to the general law of nuisance.Â  Thus, if the obstruction or alteration of the flow of surface water creates a nuisance, it does not come within the rule.Â  SeeÂ  Baltzeger v. Carolina Midway Railway, 54 S.C. 242, 32 S.E. 358 (1899).Â  The second exception applies when the discharge of water upon the lands of another is by prescriptive or contractual right.[4]Â  See Slater v. Price, 96 S.C. 245, 80 S.E. 372 (1913); Brandenburg v. Zeigler, 62 S.C. 18, 39 S.E. 790 (1901).\r\nThe traditional concept of a nuisance requires a landowner to demonstrate that the defendant unreasonably interfered with his ownership or possession of the land.Â  Silvester v. Spring Valley Country Club, 344 S.C. 280, 286, 543 S.E.2d 563, 566 (Ct. App. 2001); Ravan v. Greenville County, 315 S.C. 447, 464, 434 S.E.2d 296, 306 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  In resolving issues relating to a private nuisance, we must deal with the conflicting interests of landowners.Â  Winget v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., 242 S.C. 152, 130 S.E.2d 363 (1963).Â  â€œTo establish the line beyond which oneâ€™s exercise of his property rights becomes a legal infringement upon the property rights of another requires the delicate balancing of the correlative rights of the parties;Â  the right of one generally to make such lawful use of his property as he may desire and the right of the other to be protected in the reasonable enjoyment of his property.â€Â  Oâ€™Cain v. Oâ€™Cain, 322 S.C. 551, 560, 473 S.E.2d 460, 465-66 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œIn cases where an injunction is sought to abate an alleged private nuisance, the court must deal with the conflicting interests of the landowners by balancing the benefits of an injunction to the plaintiff against the inconvenience and damage to the defendant, and grant or deny an injunction as seems most consistent with justice and equity under the circumstances of the case.â€Â  LeFurgy v. Long Cove Club Ownerâ€™s Association, Inc., 313 S.C. 555, 443 S.E.2d 577 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\nHere, the circuit court found there â€œwas no evidence in the record that supported [Appellantâ€™s] claim that the construction of the pond, in and of itself, caused the floodingâ€ of Alexander Way.Â  We agree with this finding.Â  Pallanck testified as follows:\r\n\r\n  Q:Â  After [Lemieux] put the pond in, what happened to the flow of water off of your property?\r\n  A:Â  The flow of water was still flowing.Â  That was no problem.Â  The problem came when he decided block this ditch.Â  Thatâ€™s when the water would not flow anymore.\r\n  Q:Â  So he blocked the ditch right there and it quit flowing across the property?\r\n  A:Â  Thatâ€™s correct.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Appellantsâ€™ own testimony demonstrates the creation of the pond, in and of itself, did not create the flooding on Alexander Way.\r\nThe Appellants also claimed Lemieux, by blocking the ditch on his property, created the nuisance floodwaters.Â  The circuit court found the only evidence in the record supported a finding that Lemieux created this ditch in 1985 or 1986, and no evidence supported Appellantsâ€™ argument that the ditch was a natural feature of the property.Â  The court also concluded there was no evidence that Lemieuxâ€™s title was burdened by an easement permitting others to utilize the ditch for drainage.Â  The evidence supports such a finding.Â  Throughout the trial, Appellants were repeatedly asked if they were aware of who built the Lemieux ditch, and each responded they did not.Â  On the other hand, Lemieux testified he built the ditch â€œsometime in 1985â€ while he was renting the property.Â  \r\nThe circuit court then balanced the competing interests of Lemieux and Appellants.Â  The court concluded the Appellants have no easement rights in the Lemieux ditch, and balanced that finding with the fact that Appellants have a platted drainage easement to solve this drainage problem.Â  Thus, rather than burdening the Lemieux lot with the drainage of the surface water, the court determined Appellants should avail themselves of the existing easement to solve the water problems.Â  After a review of the record, we agree with the balancing of interests as set forth by the circuit court and the conclusion that the actions of Lemieux are consistent with his rights as a landowner under the â€œcommon enemyâ€ rule.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pallanck encroachment into Alexander Way\r\nAppellants contend the circuit court erred in finding Pallanck had encroached into the Alexander Way easement.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe law is settled in South Carolina that when the width, length, and location of an easement for ingress and egress have been set forth in a plat or other instrument, then the rights under the easement exist as to all of the land within the easement, and no party may occupy or obstruct any portion of it.Â  Xanadu Horizontal Property Regime v. Ocean Walk Horizontal Property Regime, 306 S.C. 170, 172, 410 S.E.2d 580, 581-82 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nIn this matter, Pallanck admitted at trial he installed the curbing and poles on the property, and there was testimony from the surveyors that the curbing was within the Alexander Way easement.Â  Therefore, the circuit court correctly found Pallanck encroached on the Alexander Way easement.\r\nIII.&nbsp;Mandatory Injunction\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred in granting a mandatory injunction requiring Pallanck to remove any of the improvements that encroach on the Alexander Way easement.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe issuance of an injunction is within the sound discretion of the judge who heard the case.Â  County of Richland v. Simpkins, 348 S.C. 664, 668, 560 S.E.2d 902, 904 (Ct.

Dept. of Probation, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Eddie Norris, Jr., appeals the revocation of his probation.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\n In March 2003, Eddie Norris, Jr. (Appellant) was indicted for criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature (CDVHAN) in regard to a violent incident between he and his wife, Gina Norris.Â  Appellant pled guilty and was sentenced to ten years imprisonment, suspended upon service of six months imprisonment and three years probation. \r\nIn August 2004, an arrest warrant was issued for Appellant citing the following probation violations:\r\n\r\n  By failing to report as instructed by his supervising agent in that the offender did not report for his scheduled monthly report on 12-3-03; [b]y failing to report as instructed for his scheduled DNA testing date in that the offender did not report for DNA testing on 12-10-03 as instructed by his supervising agent; [b]y moving from his approved residence without the consent of his agent in that the offender moved from his approved residence of 8180 Old Milton Rd. in Clinton to an unapproved residence . . . ; [b]y there being probable cause that the offender committed CDV on or about 12-5-03 which is a violation of the laws of the state and a violation of his probation; [b]y failing to pay towards his court ordered surcharge and being $12.00 in arrears at the time of this warrant; and by failing to follow the advice and instructions of his supervising agent.\r\n\r\nFollowing a hearing on the alleged violations, the circuit court specifically found Appellant violated his probation by failing to report as ordered, moving from his approved residence, and violating the laws of this state.Â  The court revoked the probation in full and reinstated nine years and six months of his initial sentence.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nAppellant contends the circuit erred in revoking his probation because he was denied due process.Â  Specifically, Appellant argues the circuit court abused its discretion by basing the revocation on allegations of domestic abuse that were not corroborated by criminal charges.Â  We disagree.\r\nAppellantâ€™s probation revocation was based on several grounds, including failure to report to scheduled meetings; yet the present appeal addresses only the allegation of criminal domestic violence.Â  Because Appellant did not appeal the alternative grounds of revocation, they are the law of case and are, in themselves, adequate grounds for the revocation.Â  See Sloan v. Depâ€™t. of Transp., 365 S.C. 299, __, 618 S.E.2d 876, 880 (2005) (â€œThe failure to appeal an alternative ground of the judgment below will result in affirmance.â€); State v.

Wilson, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Norma Hubbard appeals from the denial of her motion for relief from a default judgment.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn July 16, 1999, Hubbard executed and delivered a $30,000 promissory note to George Arledge.Â  The note provides that \r\nmonthly payments of $200 are to be made until the principal is paid in full, with zero percent annual interest.Â  The \r\nnote further provides that it was given for the purchase of real property and is secured by a mortgage that is a first \r\nlien upon the property.Â  Patsy Arledge (Arledge) is the owner and holder of the note and mortgage by virtue of being \r\nthe sole heir of George Arledge.Â \r\n\r\nArledge filed an action against Hubbard on November 4, 2003, alleging that Hubbard had broken the terms of the note \r\nand mortgage by failing to pay the monthly installments, and Hubbard owed $29,800 on the note.Â  Hubbard was personally \r\nserved the summons and complaint on December 15, 2003.Â  On February 3, 2004, Arledge filed a motion for default judgment \r\nbecause Hubbard failed to file an answer within the 30-day time period.Â  In response, Hubbard filed her answer to the \r\ncomplaint on March 1, 2004.Â  During a hearing on March 16, 2004, Arledge sought foreclosure of the mortgage and transfer \r\nof the title of property to her name.Â  Prior to testimony, Hubbard motioned the court pursuant to Rule 55(c), SCRCP, to \r\nset aside the default on the basis that good cause existed for not holding Hubbard in default and that she had a \r\nmeritorious defense.Â  After finding that Hubbard was in default and there was no evidence of excusable neglect for \r\nHubbardâ€™s failure to file a timely answer, the judge granted Arledgeâ€™s request for foreclosure of the mortgage and \r\nordered the title be transferred back to her name.Â  Hubbard now appeals.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHubbard argues the trial court erred in denying her Rule 55(c), SCRCP, motion because good cause existed and she had a \r\nmeritorious defense.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\nâ€œA motion to vacate or set aside a default judgment is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge whose \r\nruling will not be disturbed absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion.â€Â  \r\nGriffin v. Capital Cash, 310 S.C. 288, 294, 423 S.E.2d 143, 147 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  Rule 12(a), SCRCP, requires \r\na party to serve his or her answer within 30 days after he or she has been served with the complaint.Â  However, Hubbard \r\nfailed to file her answer within the 30-day time period and did not file any responsive pleading to the summons and complaint \r\nuntil after she was notified of Arledgeâ€™s motion for default judgment.Â  Even then, the trial judge noted that Hubbardâ€™s answer \r\nâ€œjust denied and admitted certain paragraphs in the complaint.â€Â  The judge further stated, â€œ[t]he answer is not verified, been \r\nno statements from Ms. Hubbard, either by affidavit or otherwise.Â  So, it doesnâ€™t appear to me that there is a meritorious \r\ndefense. . . . I canâ€™t gather a meritorious defense from reading the answer.â€Â  Thus, the trial judge did not abuse his \r\ndiscretion in denying to grant Hubbardâ€™s motion to set aside the entry of default judgment.Â Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and SHORT, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-580","title":"Garrett v.

(2) failing to require Wife to list the values of her life insurance; (3) refusing to require that Wife reimburse Husband for utilities Wife was ordered to pay; and (4) awarding Wife a portion of her attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Wife argues the family court erred in:Â  (1) including the second mortgage as marital debt; and (2) valuing the marital home.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were married in New York on June 29, 1981.Â  The partiesâ€™ son, Johnathan, was born September 9, 1981.Â  The family lived in New York, with Husband and Wife maintaining separate bank accounts and finances, until Husbandâ€™s retirement in late 1992.Â  At that time, Husband moved to Charleston, South Carolina, and purchased a home.Â  At the end of the school year, Johnathan moved to South Carolina to live with Husband.Â  Although she visited Husband and Johnathan in South Carolina, Wife remained in New York for nearly two more years until she was eligible for an early retirement at her job.Â  Wife moved to South Carolina into the house with Husband and Johnathan in late 1994.Â  It is undisputed that Husband purchased the marital home and furnishings without any financial contribution from Wife.Â  The parties continued to maintain separate finances, with Husband paying all the bills and Wife buying groceries.Â Â  \r\nDuring the partiesâ€™ marriage, Wife made allegations of domestic abuse.Â  The first occurred in New York in 1981, but the parties remained together.Â  The final allegation of domestic abuse occurred in December 2001, when the parties argued and Wife alleged that Husband threatened her.Â  The partiesâ€™ son, Johnathan, intervened in that incident, and the police were called.Â  Husband was arrested, and the parties maintained separate residences from that point on.Â  Criminal charges were filed against Husband regarding the domestic incident, and the charges were still pending at the time of the final divorce hearing.Â  \r\nOn January 22, 2002, Wife filed an action for separate maintenance and support, alleging Husband was abusive.Â  She sought a restraining order against Husband, alimony, use of the marital home, equitable apportionment of the marital assets and debts, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Husband answered, denying the abuse.Â  After a temporary hearing, Wife was awarded exclusive use of the marital home, with Husband paying the mortgage, taxes, and insurance payments associated with the home.Â  Wife was ordered to pay any of the remaining expenses associated with the home.Â  Both parties were restrained from bothering the other, and each party was ordered responsible for their own attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nThe final hearing on the matter was held on February 4, 2003, and March 18, 2003.Â  Prior to the hearing, the family court allowed Husband to amend his answer and counterclaim to include a request for a divorce based upon one year of separation and a counterclaim of condonation as to any allegations of abuse.Â  After hearing the matter, the family court granted the parties a divorce based upon the statutory ground of one yearâ€™s separation and denied Wifeâ€™s request for alimony.Â  The court specifically found that Wife did not seek a divorce based upon physical cruelty and that she failed to meet her burden of proving physical cruelty.Â  The court awarded Husband the marital home.[1]Â  Considering the first mortgage on the home, the court determined that the home had $47,215 in equity.Â  The court refused to consider the $43,000 second mortgage on the home as marital debt, finding Wife did not benefit from the second mortgage.Â  Husband was awarded sixty-five percent of the marital estate and Wife was awarded thirty-five percent.Â  In effectuating this distribution, Husband was ordered to pay Wife $45,485.37.Â  Husband was also ordered to pay $4,477.50 of Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â Â Â  \r\nUpon Husbandâ€™s motion to alter or amend the order, the family court modified the order to include the second mortgage as marital debt.Â  Thus, the equity in the marital home was reduced by $43,000 and Wifeâ€™s cash payout was reduced to $7,692.77.Â  On August 20, 2003, Wife filed a motion to alter or amend the amended order, arguing that the court erred in considering the second mortgage and that Wife was entitled to alimony, considering the low monetary award she would be receiving in the distribution.Â  During the pendency of Wifeâ€™s motion, Husband filed a notice of appeal on August 26, 2003.Â  Wife also filed a notice of appeal on September 11, 2003.Â  Wife filed a motion with this court to remand the matter to the family court to hear her motion to alter or amend.Â  This court granted the motion to remand, and the family court denied Wifeâ€™s motion to alter or amend on January 28, 2004.Â  The parties then proceeded with their respective appeals.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has authority to find the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  We are mindful that the family court, which saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Husbandâ€™s Appeal\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in awarding Wife thirty-five percent of the marital property, failing to require that Wife list her life insurance values, failing to require that Wife reimburse Husband for utilities, and awarding Wife a portion of her attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We address each argument separately below.\r\nA. Equitable Distribution\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in distributing any of the marital estate to Wife because Wife did not make any contributions to the marital estate.Â  He argues the family court failed to consider the lack of contributions in the award, and thus, the order was deficient.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe apportionment of marital property will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Bungener v. Bungener, 291 S.C. 247, 251, 353 S.E.2d 147, 150 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Section 20-7-472 lists fifteen factors for the court to consider in equitably apportioning a marital estate.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2004); Greene v. Greene, 351 S.C. 329, 340, 569 S.E.2d 393, 399 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  These factors include:Â  (1) the length of the marriage and the ages of the parties; (2) the martial misconduct of either party; (3) the value of the marital property; (4) the income and earning potential of each spouse; (5) each partyâ€™s emotional and physical health; (6) the need of a spouse for training to reach his or her earning potential; (7) each partyâ€™s nonmarital property; (8) retirement benefits; (9) awards of alimony; (10) whether the marital home should be awarded to one spouse; (11) the tax consequences of a particular distribution; (12) the existence of support obligations from prior marriage; (13) liens or encumbrances on marital property and any debt; (14) child custody arrangements; and (15) any other relevant factor the trial court enumerates in the order.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2004).Â  \r\nThis court will affirm an order for equitable distribution if it can be determined that the family court judge addressed the statutory factors sufficiently for us to conclude she was cognizant of the factors.Â  Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 100, 545 S.E.2d 531, 537 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  On appeal, this court looks to the overall fairness of the apportionment.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  If the end result is equitable, it is irrelevant that the appellate court would have arrived at a different apportionment.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nAt the final hearing, Wife testified that although Husband paid the mortgage and all the utilities for the marital home, she bought groceries and supplies for the house.Â  She admitted that Husband cooked and washed the laundry sometimes, but she stated she performed those duties as well.Â  Wife stated she cleaned the house.Â  By contrast, Husband testified that he washed the laundry for himself and Johnathan, while Wife only washed her own clothes â€œ90 percent of the time.â€Â  Husband admitted that Wife purchased groceries for the house, although he paid all the other household bills.Â Â  \r\nThe family courtâ€™s extensive order recited facts concerning the length of the partiesâ€™ marriage, the ages and relative health of each of the parties, how the parties maintained separate finances, the marital assets and debts, monetary and non-monetary contributions of each party to the acquisition of assets, and the income and potential for income of each party.Â  In awarding Wife thirty-five percent of the marital estate, the family court specifically noted in its order that it was considering all the factors set forth in section 20-7-742.Â Â  \r\nWe find no error with the family courtâ€™s award.Â  Although the evidence supports a finding that Husband financially contributed more during the marriage, Wife also testified regarding some financial contributions and homemaker contributions.Â  It is clear from the order that the family court adequately considered the statutory factors in awarding Wife thirty-five percent of the marital estate.Â  Accordingly, we find no error with the equitable distribution.\r\nB. Wifeâ€™s Life Insurance\r\nCiting Cannon v. Cannon, 321 S.C. 44, 467 S.E.2d 132 (Ct. App. 1996), Husband argues the equitable distribution was incomplete and the case should be remanded for specific findings where the family court did not require that Wife verify the values of her life insurance.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n  It is well settled that in making an equitable distribution of marital property, the family court must: (1) identify the marital property, real and personal, to be divided between the parties; (2) determine the fair market value of the property so identified; (3) identify the proportionate contributions, both direct and indirect, of each party to the acquisition of the marital property; and (4) provide for an equitable division of the marital property.Â  \r\n\r\nCannon v. Cannon, 321 S.C. 44, 48, 467 S.E.2d 132, 134 (Ct. App. 1996) (citations omitted).Â  Where a court fails to rule upon an issue concerning the identity and value of real and personal marital property, despite a request by the parties to do so, the equitable distribution is incomplete, and the issue should be remanded for specific findings by the family court.Â  Id. at 48, 467 S.E.2d at 135.Â  \r\nDuring the final hearing, Wife testified that she had a life insurance policy with John Hancock, but she did not know the cash value.Â  She further stated that Husbandâ€™s counsel could contact John Hancock to obtain the cash value; however, she was not aware that she had to obtain that value prior to coming to court.Â  Wifeâ€™s financial declaration indicated that her life insurance cash value was zero.Â  No further evidence was presented regarding Wifeâ€™s life insurance.Â  The family court order did not address the John Hancock life insurance policy.Â  In ruling on Husbandâ€™s motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, the family court found that there was no evidence presented of the value of the policy, and it was Husbandâ€™s burden to present evidence of the value of an asset in which he claimed an interest.Â Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Husbandâ€™s entire argument in support of this issue is only one paragraph long.Â  In the argument, Husband states that Wife should be sanctioned for failing to disclose the value of her life insurance policy, the value of the life insurance policy must now be obtained upon remand, and the equitable apportionment must be altered to reflect Wifeâ€™s receipt of the value of the life insurance.Â  \r\nThis issue may not be preserved for appellate review.Â  Although Husband noted in his motion for reconsideration that Wife failed to supply the value of her life insurance policy, he did not argue that this fact rendered the equitable distribution incomplete or that Wife should be sanctioned.Â  The record does not reflect that Husband complained about Wifeâ€™s failure to list the value of her life insurance during the trial.Â  Because the arguments now raised on appeal were not raised during the final hearing and Husband failed to assert them in his post-trial motion, they are not preserved for appellate review.Â  See Joubert v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 341 S.C. 176, 184, 534 S.E.2d 1, 5 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding that issues not raised to or ruled upon by the trial court are not preserved for appellate review).\r\n In any event, this case can be distinguished from Cannon.Â  In Cannon, the wife failed to present any evidence regarding the value of the personal property within the marital home, and the husband testified that he â€œguessedâ€ the value of the personal property to be $10,000.Â  The family court awarded the wife the marital home, including the personal property, but did not place any value on the personal property, despite the husbandâ€™s request to do so both during trial and in a post-trial motion.Â  This court remanded the issue of the valuation of the personal property, finding the equitable distribution was incomplete where the family court failed to address the issue despite the request to do so.Â  Cannon, 321 S.C. at 48, 467 S.E.2d at 135.Â  \r\nIn the present case, Husband did not request the family court to value the life insurance policy, nor did he present any evidence regarding the value of Wifeâ€™s life insurance policy.Â  It was Husbandâ€™s burden to present evidence of the value of the life insurance policy if he disputed the value presented by Wife.Â  See Roe v. Roe, 311 S.C. 471, 479, 429 S.E.2d 830, 836 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding that a party may not complain on appeal that the trial courtâ€™s valuation is unsupported by the evidence without offering proof of its value at trial); Honea v. Honea, 292 S.C. 456, 458, 357 S.E.2d 191, 192 (Ct. App. 1987) (holding that a party cannot â€œsit back at trial without offering proof, then come to this Court complaining of the insufficiency of the evidence to support the family courtâ€™s findingsâ€).\r\nBecause Husband failed to present any evidence regarding the value of the life insurance policy, we find no error with that portion of the family courtâ€™s equitable distribution.Â Â  \r\nC.Â  Utility Payments\r\nHusband argues the family court erred by failing to require Wife to reimburse him for utility payments she was ordered to pay.Â  He asserts the family court did not have the authority to overrule the prior order of another judge and the courtâ€™s reasons for refusing to order reimbursement to Husband were not valid.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThere is a long standing rule in South Carolina that one judge may not overrule another judge of the same court.â€Â  Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 457, 477 S.E.2d 476, 483 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\nAt the temporary hearing, Wife was awarded temporary use of the marital home.Â  Husband was ordered to maintain the mortgage payments on the home.Â  Wife, however, was ordered to pay the â€œremainder of the expenses involving the marital residence.â€Â  For several months, Husband continued to make utility payments through automatic drafts of his bank account.Â  Husband sought reimbursement of $930.04 towards utility payments from Wife.Â  \r\nDuring the final hearing before a different family court judge, Wife admitted that she initially failed to make the utility payments for the marital home.Â  However, Wife stated she had difficulty in getting the utility bills transferred into her name.Â  She testified that SCE&amp;G told her that she could not get the electric bill in her name until Husband stopped the automatic draft from his bank account and she provided a copy of the temporary order.Â  She was informed the same thing when she attempted to get the Comcast television cable bill placed in her name.Â  She eventually was able to transfer the SCE&amp;G, Comcast cable, and water bills into her name several months after the temporary hearing.Â  Husband, however, refused to allow the telephone account to be transferred to Wifeâ€™s name.Â  Wife testified that Husband, as a retired telephone company employee, received some reimbursement from the telephone bills as a benefit.Â  In order for Wife to pay the telephone bill pursuant to the temporary order, Husband would forward the telephone bill to Wife and she would reimburse him.Â  Wife testified that approximately six months prior to trial, however, Husband refused to forward the telephone bill to her, and he was still paying the telephone bill at the time of the final hearing.Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe family court denied Husbandâ€™s request for reimbursement, finding that:Â  (1) Husband failed to seek a remedy to the problem during the pendency of the action; and (2) some of the problems Wife had with paying the utilities were due to Husbandâ€™s uncooperativeness.Â  In his motion for reconsideration, Husband argued that the court erred in failing to order that Wife reimburse him because there was no legal justification for Husband to seek a remedy during the pendency of the action.Â  He also argued that the family court erred in â€œnot requiring the wife to be responsible for her obligations in the Order, yet the court, by this rationale, would then justify the husband to â€˜choseâ€™ not to pay court ordered obligations he would have pursuant to an order, which is unjustifiably inconsistent.â€Â  \r\nWe find the family courtâ€™s refusal to order that Wife reimburse Husband did not amount to the overruling of the prior family court judgeâ€™s order.Â  The family court did not change the section of the prior order that required Wife to be responsible for utility payments; the court merely ruled that reimbursement was unnecessary for the few months Wife failed to pay due, in part, to Husbandâ€™s uncooperativeness.Â  Further, considering the fact that Husband obtained sixty-five percent of the marital estate in distribution, Husband was in the better position to absorb this cost.Â  We find the family court did not abuse its discretion in ruling reimbursement was not necessary.Â  \r\nD.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nHusband asserts the family court erred in awarding Wife a portion of her attorneyâ€™s fees because the court only considered the amount of the award and failed to consider whether the award was warranted.Â  We agree.\r\nThe family court may order payment of attorneyâ€™s fees to a party pursuant to South Carolina Code section 20-3-130(H) (Supp. 2004).Â  Whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court, and the award will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Bakala v. Bakala, 352 S.C. 612, 633-34, 576 S.E.2d 156, 167 (2003).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs either when a court is controlled by some error of law, or where the order is based upon findings of fact lacking evidentiary support.â€Â  Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 529, 599 S.E.2d 114, 121 (2004).Â  \r\nIn determining whether an award of attorneyâ€™s fees should be granted, the family court should consider:Â  the partiesâ€™ ability to pay their own fee; the beneficial results obtained by counsel; the financial conditions of the parties; and the effect of the fee on each partiesâ€™ standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  To determine the amount of an award of attorneyâ€™s fees, the court should consider:Â  the nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered; the time necessarily devoted to the case; counselâ€™s professional standing; the contingency of compensation; the beneficial results obtained; and the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).\r\nWife initially filed an action for separate maintenance and support alleging physical abuse and requesting full use and possession of the marital home, alimony, an equitable division of the marital property, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  In the final order, the family court determined that Wife failed to meet her burden of proving Husband committed physical cruelty, and Wife could earn between $17,000 and $32,000 per year in income in addition to her pension.Â  Considering Wifeâ€™s imputed income of at least $17,000 per year in addition to her pension, the family court determined Wife was not in need of alimony.Â  The family court awarded permanent possession of the marital home to Husband.Â Â Â  \r\nNevertheless, the family court ruled in its final order that contribution to Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees was â€œnecessary and proper and has been justified by the evidence presented in Court.â€Â  The court noted that Wife had to retain counsel in order to pursue the divorce.Â  In setting the amount of the fees, the court considered â€œthe result accomplished,â€ the fact that Wifeâ€™s attorney was actively engaged in family court matters, amount of time spent on the case, and the reasonableness of the attorneyâ€™s rate.Â  The order noted that factors and criteria for setting attorneyâ€™s fees were contained in Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403 S.E.2d 313 (1991), Nienow v. Nienow, 268 S.C. 161, 230 S.E.2d 504 (1977), and Atkinson v. Atkinson, 279 S.C. 355, 309 S.E.2d 14 (Ct. App. 1983).Â  The court stated that â€œbased upon all of the aforementioned standards,â€ Husband should contribute $4,477.50 towards Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Husband argued in his post-trial motion that the family court failed to consider whether the award of attorneyâ€™s fees was justified, but the family court refused to reconsider the matter.Â  \r\nIn determining that attorneyâ€™s fees should be awarded, the family court merely noted that the evidence supported an award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We cannot determine from this statement in the order whether the court considered all the facts in determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Specifically, we note that the beneficial result obtained by Wifeâ€™s attorney was negligible.Â  See Sexton v. Sexton, 310 S.C. 501, 503, 427 S.E.2d 665, 666 (1992) (â€œThe beneficial result obtained by counsel is a factor essential to determining whether an attorneyâ€™s fee should be awarded.â€) (emphasis added).Â  Wife did not obtain a finding of physical abuse, alimony, or the marital home.Â  Further, the family court found Wife had the ability to earn income to support herself.Â  Presumably, this meant that Wife had the ability to earn income to pay her own attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nBecause we cannot determine from the order that the court adequately considered all the factors necessary in deciding whether an award was appropriate, we reverse the award of attorneyâ€™s fees and remand the matter to the family court for further consideration.Â Â Â  \r\nII.Â  Wifeâ€™s Appeal\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Wife argues the family court erred in including the second mortgage as marital debt and in valuing the marital home.Â  We address each argument separately below. \r\nA. Second Mortgage\r\nWife argues that the family court erred in including the second mortgage as marital debt where the court specifically considered that the parties maintained separate finances.Â  She asserts that she had no knowledge of the debt and did not receive any benefit from it.Â  Thus, she argues, it was error for the court to require her to pay thirty-five percent of the second mortgage.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 20-7-472 requires that a family court must consider and apportion marital debt when equitably dividing the marital estate.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472(13) (Supp. 2004) (â€œIn making apportionment, the court must give weight . . . to the following factors:Â  (13) â€œliens and any other encumbrances upon the marital property, which themselves must be equitably divided, or upon the separate property of either of the parties, and any other existing debts incurred by the parties or either of them during the course of the marriage.â€); Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 546, 615 S.E.2d 98, 105 (2005) (â€œMarital debt, like marital property, must be specifically identified and apportioned in equitable distribution.â€).Â  Thus, there is a rebuttable presumption that either partiesâ€™ debt which was incurred prior to the marital litigation is a marital debt that must be considered in equitable apportionment.Â  Wooten, 364 S.C. at 546, 615 S.E.2d at 105; Hickum v. Hickum, 320 S.C. 97, 102, 463 S.E.2d 321, 324 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  â€œWhen the debt is incurred before marital litigation begins, the burden of proving a debt is nonmarital rests upon the party who makes such an assertion.â€Â  Wooten, 364 S.C. at 547, 615 S.E.2d at 105. \r\nHusband took out a second mortgage on the marital home approximately five years prior to the final hearing.Â  At the time of the final hearing, the balance owed on the second mortgage was $43,000.Â  Wife testified she did not know about the second mortgage until after the partiesâ€™ separation, she received no benefit from the mortgage, and she was told by Husband that the money was used to purchase furniture.Â  Wife indicated some disbelief regarding the use of the funds, stating that the parties did not have furniture in the house worth that value.Â  Wife admitted that Husband purchased all of the household furnishings.Â  Husband testified at the final hearing that the second mortgage was used to purchase furniture and various items for the house, including a freezer and a computer, and to pay off credit cards.Â Â Â  \r\nIn the final divorce decree, the family court noted that the furnishings Husband claimed were purchased with the second mortgage â€œdo not, by any stretch of the imagination, come closeâ€ to $43,000.Â  The court noted that the monies were used to consolidate Husbandâ€™s credit cards, of which he admitted â€œWife should not have a duty to pay, or in some other fashion he chose not to elaborate.â€Â  Noting that Wife did not benefit from the vast majority of the proceeds of the second mortgage, the court ruled that the second mortgage would not be included as marital debt to reduce the equity in the marital home.Â  After considering Husbandâ€™s post-trial motion to amend the order, the family court ordered that the second mortgage should be included as marital debt because Wife failed to present any evidence that would overcome the presumption that the debt was marital.Â  Thus, the equity in the marital home was reduced from $47,215 to $4,215.Â Â Â  \r\nWe find no error with the family courtâ€™s decision to include the second mortgage as marital debt.Â  Although there was very little evidence specifying precisely how the money from the second mortgage was spent, Husband testified that he purchased items for the home with the funds.Â  The only evidence Wife presented was her testimony that she did not believe the furnishings in the home were worth the value of the second mortgage.Â  Wife did not present any evidence that would overcome the presumption that the funds from the second mortgage were spent to benefit the marriage.Â  Under these circumstances, the family court did not abuse its discretion in determining the second mortgage was a marital debt thereby reducing the equity in the marital home.\r\nEven assuming that the family court erred, we find any potential error in including the second mortgage as an additional expense has been compensated for.Â  Since the August 2003 final amended order was stayed pending this appeal, Wife has remained in the marital home pursuant to the temporary order for over twenty-five months without having to pay rent or contribute towards the mortgage payments.Â  Husband testified at the final hearing that he made a total of $1,250 in monthly mortgage payments.Â  Thus, Husband has made over $31,250 in mortgage payments since the final amended order.Â  Wife has substantially benefited from Husbandâ€™s payments on this marital asset to which she has not contributed.Â  Clearly, any potential error including the second mortgage as a marital debt has been rectified by Wife living in the marital home without having to contribute towards this asset.Â  \r\nB.Â  Value of Marital Home\r\nWife argues the family court erred in valuing the marital home at only $113,460.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn making an equitable distribution of marital property, the family court must identify real and personal marital property and determine the propertyâ€™s fair market value.Â  Cannon v. Cannon, 321 S.C. 44, 48, 467 S.E.2d 132, 134 (Ct. App. 1996); Noll v. Noll, 297 S.C. 190, 192, 375 S.E.2d 338, 340 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  â€œIn the absence of contrary evidence, the court should accept the value the parties assign to a marital asset.â€Â  Noll, 297 S.C. at 194, 375 S.E.2d at 340-41.Â  The family court does not abuse its discretion in valuing a marital asset within the range of values testified to by the parties at trial.Â  See Woodward v. Woodward, 294 S.C. 210, 215, 363 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. App. 1987) (noting the family court did not abuse its discretion in valuing real property within the range of evidence offered by the parties at trial).Â  \r\nAt the final hearing, Wife presented an appraisal valuing the marital home at $124,000 as of January 30, 2004.Â  Husband claimed the house was valued at $95,200 based upon the tax assessment value.Â  The family court found Husbandâ€™s value unreliable, elected to choose a value from among the range of values presented at trial, and determined the marital home was valued at $113,460.Â  \r\n It does not appear from the record that Wife argued in a post-trial motion that the family court erred in reaching this value.Â  Thus, the issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  Joubert v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 341 S.C. 176, 184, 534 S.E.2d 1, 5 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding that issues not raised to or ruled upon by the trial court are not preserved for appellate review).\r\nIn any event, we find no error with the family courtâ€™s decision to choose a value among the range of values presented at trial.Â  Wifeâ€™s valuation took place nearly one year after marital litigation began, and the tax assessment valuation was deemed unreliable.Â  In these circumstances, the family court did not abuse its discretion in valuing the marital home within the range of evidence presented at trial. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the family courtâ€™s order is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nGOOLSBY, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Husband was awarded the marital home in the final divorce decree, and Wife has not appealed from this award.Â  However, Wife has remained in the marital home, pursuant to the temporary order without paying Husband any rent, pending this appeal.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-581","title":"McMillan v.

Pleasant, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this action to recover on a promissory note, Charles E. McMillan appeals the ruling of the Master in Equity granting a directed verdict in favor of Peter J. Evans d/b/a Stella Nova.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFacts\r\nOn May 3, 2002, Bruce McMillan filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy.Â  At the time, he owed his brother, Charles â€œEddieâ€ McMillan, $65,000.00.Â  That amount was not reported on the Schedule of Creditors Holding Unsecured Priority Claims.Â  Nonetheless, both Eddie McMillan and Bruce McMillan agreed that Bruce was to pay his brother back when financially solvent.\r\nAfter he filed for bankruptcy, Bruce McMillan approached Peter Evans, the founder and operator of Stella Nova, about selling a parcel of land located in Summerville. Â The land appraised for $295,000.00, but Bruce was willing to sell it to Evans for $265,000.00. Â Bruce maintained that Evans, for unspecified reasons, could only get a loan from the bank in the amount of $200,000.00. Â Therefore, Bruce suggested they create a separate promissory note in the amount of $65,000.00. Â However, Evans stated that Bruce wanted the bank to list $200,000.00 as the selling price, and that he could have received a loan for the full amount of $265,000.00.Â  Ultimately, the parties sought and gained the permission of the bankruptcy court to sell the property for $200,000.00.Â  Afterwards, they drafted a promissory note for the $65,000.00.\r\nBruce McMillan wanted Evans to pay the $65,000.00 promissory note to his brother, Eddie McMillan.Â  By doing so, Bruce would satisfy his debt to Eddie.Â  Eventually, Evans and Bruce McMillan decided on a promissory note in the amount of $57,870.00. Â The difference in the price was attributed to Evans paying for the appraisal and getting credit for rent.Â  Even though Bruce McMillan and Evans were making plans for Evans to pay Eddie McMillan, Evans and Eddie had not met or spoken.\r\nOn July 11, 2002, Evans and Bruce McMillan signed the promissory note outside of the presence of any attorneys.Â  Thereafter, they proceeded to Attorney Joe Mendlesohnâ€™s office and closed on the Summerville real estate.Â  The formal closing stated that the property was being sold for $200,000.00 only and that there were no other liens on the property. Â After the formal closing was complete, Evans asked for the promissory note.Â  Evans told Bruce McMillan, â€œI canâ€™t give this money to your brother without a reason.Â  I have to have a reason for an accounting purpose.â€ Â Because Evans was concerned about defrauding the bankruptcy court, he changed the note.Â  Evans made the $57,870.00 due for consulting work to be performed by Eddie McMillan. Â Those changes were made in front of Bruce McMillan and with his permission. Â Evans and Eddie McMillan had still not communicated. After the closing was complete, Eddie McMillan never received any money from Evans.\r\nEddie McMillan, filed a Summons and Complaint on December 9, 2002, whereby Eddie sought recovery of the balance due on a Balloon Payment Promissory Note and prayed for judgment against Peter J. Evans d/b/a Stella Nova, in the amount of Fifty Seven Thousand Eight Hundred Seventy and 00/100 ($57,870.00) Dollars, together with interest thereon at 6.5 % per annum together with monthly late charges in the amount of $25.00 per month, and attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.\r\nEvans answered, admitting that he signed the note, but affirmatively stated that he signed the note under fraudulent circumstances unknown to him at the time. Â Evans affirmatively pled a failure of consideration and asserted that the actions by Charles McMillan and his brother, Bruce McMillan, to collect on the note amounted to an attempt to defraud the United States Bankruptcy Court and circumvent the United States Bankruptcy Code.\r\nOn April 19, 2004, the case was referred by the Court of Common Pleas to the Master in Equity Court for a final hearing. Â The Court of Common Pleas further ordered that any appeal taken from a final order be in accordance with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-11-85, which provides that an appeal from an order must be to the South Carolina Supreme Court or Court of Appeals as provided by the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules.\r\nOn September 13, 2004, this case was tried before the Master in Equity.Â  The master decided the action was at law.Â  At the close of evidence, the trial court directed a verdict in favor of Evans. Â He ruled the note was contingent upon legal consideration. Â The court found a failure of consideration on the subject note.Â  The court determined the sales price in the written contract of sale for the subject property was the actual consideration for the sale. Â Upon finding no consideration for the promissory note, the master held that Evans owed nothing to Eddie McMillan. Â The court held that Eddie McMillan was judicially estopped from asserting a sales price of the subject property inconsistent with that asserted by his privy and brother, Bruce McMillan, in the United States Bankruptcy Court.\r\nStandard of Review \r\nIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  The rule is the same whether the judgeâ€™s findings are made with or without a reference. Id. The judgeâ€™s findings are equivalent to a juryâ€™s findings in a law action.Â  Chapman v. Allstate Ins. Co., 263 S.C. 565, 211 S.E.2d 876 (1974).\r\nDiscussion\r\nI.Â  Consideration\r\nBruce and Eddie McMillan argue that consideration for the $57,870.00 promissory note was the discounted property price and the conveyance of the subject real estate.Â  We disagree.\r\nA contract exists where there is an agreement between two or more people contingent on sufficient consideration either to do or not to do a particular act. Â Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 582 S.E.2d 432 (Ct. App. 2003); Benya v. Gamble, 282 S.C. 624, 321 S.E.2d 57 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  There must be an offer and an acceptance accompanied by valuable consideration. Â Regions Bank, 354 S.C. at 661, 582 S.E.2d at 439; Carolina Amusement Co. v. Connecticut Natâ€™l Life Ins. Co., 313 S.C. 215, 437 S.E.2d 122 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\nThe rule in this State is that parol evidence is admissible to show a different consideration from that expressed in a written instrument when language of consideration is intended as a mere recital, but not when it is contractual.Â  Iseman v. Hobbs, 290 S.C 482, 351 S.E.2d 351 (Ct. App. 1986); see also Shelton v. Skyland Stages, Inc., 170 S.C. 100, 169 S.E. 718 (1933); Gladden v. Keistler, 141 S.C. 524, 140 S.E. 161 (1927).Â  If the consideration recited is an act or forbearance, as distinguished from a promise or covenant, it may be shown that it did not take place and that therefore the writing is gratuitous and unenforceable.Â  Iseman, 290 S.C at 484, 351 S.E.2d at 352-53.Â  Whereas, if a promise or covenant is recited as having been made as consideration, this recital cannot be contradicted, explained, or varied by extrinsic evidence.Â  Id. at 484, 351 S.E.2d at 353.\r\nWhere the agreement in question is a written contract, the partiesâ€™ intention must be gathered from the contents of the entire agreement and not from any particular clause thereof.Â  Ellie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 594 S.E.2d 485 (Ct. App. 2004); Barnacle Broad., Inc. v. Baker Broad., Inc., 343 S.C. 140, 538 S.E.2d 672 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  If its language is plain, unambiguous, and capable of only one reasonable interpretation, no construction is required and the contractâ€™s language determines the instrumentâ€™s force and effect.Â  Jordan v. Security Group, Inc., 311 S.C. 227, 428 S.E.2d 705 (1993); Blakely v. Rabon, 266 S.C. 68, 221 S.E.2d 767 (1976); Miccichi, 358 S.C. at 93, 594 S.E.2d at 493.Â  When an agreement is clear and capable of legal interpretation, the courtâ€™s only function is to interpret its lawful meaning, discover the intention of the parties as found within the agreement, and give effect to it.Â  Heins v. Heins, 344 S.C. 146, 543 S.E.2d 224 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The court must enforce an unambiguous contract according to its terms, regardless of the contractâ€™s wisdom or folly, or the partiesâ€™ failure to guard their rights carefully.Â  Ellis v. Taylor, 316 S.C. 245, 449 S.E.2d 487 (1994).Â  To discover the intention of a contract, the court must first look to its language to see if the language is perfectly plain and capable of legal construction; that alone determines the documentâ€™s force and effect.Â  Superior Auto. Ins. Co. v. Maners, 261 S.C. 257, 199 S.E.2d 719 (1973); Miccichi, 358 S.C. at 94, 594 S.E.2d at 493.\r\nOriginally, the property appraised for $295,000.00.Â  However, Bruce McMillan made it clear that he only needed $200,000.00 to satisfy the property debt and $65,000.00 to satisfy his debt to Eddie McMillan.Â  Bruce offered the property to Evans for $265,000.00 and Evans accepted.Â  An agreement was formed between Bruce McMillan and Peter Evans, and permission was gained from the bankruptcy court to sell the property for $200,000.00.Â  The deed selling the property to Peter Evans from Bruce McMillan clearly stated that the property was being sold for $200,000.00 only, and that there were no other liens or encumbrances against the property.Â  After signing the deed, Bruce McMillan and Peter Evans never signed another document regarding the sale of the Summerville property.\r\nEddie McMillan sued Peter Evans for failure to pay the $57,870.00 promissory note.Â  Unfortunately, there was never an agreement between Eddie McMillan and Peter Evans, as evidenced by lack of an offer and acceptance as well as absence of consideration.Â  Even though Bruce McMillan states that the consideration for the promissory note was the reduced price of $200,000.00, there is no consideration between Eddie McMillan and Peter Evans.Â  The only enforceable agreement was between Bruce McMillan and Peter Evans, not Eddie McMillan and Peter Evans.Â  Nonetheless, Bruce McMillan never had control over the property Peter Evans bought because the bankruptcy court had complete control.Â  The promissory note provides that Eddie McMillan would perform consulting services.Â  According to his own testimony, Eddie McMillan never intended to perform any consulting services.Â  He stated, â€œI had no dealings with Mr. Evans, whatsoever.â€Â  Therefore, any consideration for the promissory note was merely gratuitous.Â  No consideration exists.\r\nThe deed selling the land to Peter Evans for $200,000.00 is clear and unambiguous on its face.Â  Because there is no need to look further for any interpretation, the master correctly construed the language of the contract as being plain and capable of legal construction.\r\nII.Â  Judicial Estoppel\r\nBruce and Eddie McMillan contend the principle of judicial estoppel does not apply because it would award Peter Evans a windfall and create an injustice to Eddie McMillan.Â  We disagree.\r\nJudicial estoppel is an equitable concept that prevents a litigant from asserting a position inconsistent with, or in conflict with, one the litigant has previously asserted in the same or related proceeding.Â  Cothran v. Brown, 357 S.C. 210, 592 S.E.2d 629 (2004); see Colleton Regâ€™l Hosp. v. MRS Med. Review Sys., Inc., 866 F. Supp. 896, 900 (D.S.C. 1994).Â  The doctrineâ€™s function is to protect the integrity of the judicial process or the integrity of the courts rather than to protect litigants from allegedly improper or deceitful conduct by their adversaries.Â  Commerce Center of Greenville, Inc. v. W. Powers McElveen &amp; Assocs., Inc., 347 S.C. 545, 556 S.E.2d 718 (Ct. App. 2001); see also Cothran, 357 S.C. at 215, 592 S.E.2d at 631 (stating purpose of doctrine is to ensure integrity of judicial process, not to protect parties from allegedly dishonest conduct by their adversary). Â Stated otherwise, judicial estoppel precludes a party from adopting a position in conflict with one earlier taken in the same or related litigation.Â  Hawkins v. Bruno Yacht Sales, 353 S.C. 31, 577 S.E.2d 202 (2003); Commerce Center, 347 S.C. at 554, 556 S.E.2d at 723.\r\nIn Hayne Fed. Credit Union v. Bailey, 327 S.C. 242, 251, 489 S.E.2d 472, 477 (1997), our supreme court formally adopted the doctrine of judicial estoppel as it relates to matters of fact, not law.Â  In Cothran v. Brown, the court delineated the requirements for the application of judicial estoppel. Â The following elements are necessary for the doctrine of judicial estoppel to apply: (1) two inconsistent positions taken by the same party or parties in privity with one another; (2) the positions must be taken in the same or related proceedings involving the same party or parties in privity with each other; (3) the party taking the position must have been successful in maintaining that position and have received some benefit; (4) the inconsistency must be part of an intentional effort to mislead the court; and (5) the two positions must be totally inconsistent.Â  Cothran, 357 S.C. at 215-16, 592 S.E.2d at 632; see also Carrigg v. Cannon, 347 S.C. 75, 552 S.E.2d 767 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nBruce McMillan and Eddie McMillan were in privity with one another.Â Â  More importantly, Bruce and Eddie had maintained inconsistent positions regarding the value of the property sold.Â  Hence, the first prong is met.Â  Second, the proceedings were related because the bankruptcy trustee was the only person with the authority to designate a value on the property.Â  Furthermore, Bruce McMillan received a benefit by discharging a debt the bankruptcy court had against him, thereby satisfying the third element.Â  Next, Bruce McMillan deliberately misled the bankruptcy court by selling the property for only $200,000.00, while attempting to pay off an unlisted debt through a secret promissory note.Â Â  Finally, it is apparent that the property cannot sell for $200,000.00 and $257,870.00.Â  It must be one or the other.Â  Therefore, all five prongs are met.\r\nBruce McMillan intentionally led the bankruptcy court to rely on the $200,000.00 sale to Peter Evans.Â  For Bruce McMillan and Eddie McMillan to succeed in suing Peter Evans would be tantamount to a fraud on the bankruptcy court.Â  Judicial estoppel precludes such a travesty.\r\nConclusion\r\nAccordingly, the decision of the Master in Equity is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-582","title":"State v.

Zelenka, Senior Assistant Attorney General William Edgar Salter, III, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Barbara R. Morgan, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Charles Donnell Dublin appeals his convictions in Aiken County for murder, assault and battery with intent to kill, armed robbery, attempted armed robbery, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.Â  Dublin claims the trial court erred by admitting evidence of another crime in Orangeburg County.Â  We affirm.[1] \r\nFACTS\r\nChris Corbitt, Chanelle Duncan (Corbittâ€™s girlfriend), Tony Rainey, and Thurmond â€œDukeâ€ Jones were watching TV in Corbittâ€™s trailer on April 10, 1998, when Dublin knocked on the door.Â  He said his name was â€œTimâ€ and asked to speak to Corbitt.Â  Ricky Tolliver waited outside.Â  Corbitt, a known drug dealer, agreed to let Dublin in.Â  Dublin entered the trailer, pulled out a pistol, and struck Jones on the head with it.Â  \r\nDublin asked Corbitt where he kept his money and drugs and then shot and killed Rainey.Â  Dublin also ordered Corbitt and Duncan to the floor and told Duncan to cover her head.Â  Dublin threatened to kill her unless Corbitt told him the location of his drugs and money.Â  \r\nCorbitt told Dublin he could find the items outside under the trailer.Â  Dublin and Corbitt went to search for them while Tolliver watched the others.Â  When Dublin and Corbitt returned to the trailer to get a flashlight, Corbitt pushed Dublin away and attempted to flee.Â  Dublin fired at Corbitt, hitting him in the rear.Â  Dublin and Tolliver fled the scene.Â &nbsp;\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge whose decision will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 121, 551 S.E.2d 240, 244 (2001).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law.Â  State v. McLeod, 362 S.C. 73, 79, 606 S.E.2d 215, 219 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Error without prejudice does not warrant reversal.Â  State v. Locklair, 341 S.C. 352, 365, 535 S.E.2d 420, 427 (2000).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nDublin argues the trial judge erred by ruling that his counsel opened the door to otherwise inadmissible evidence when he sought to impeach Tolliver by asking him questions about his involvement in other crimes committed in Orangeburg County.\r\nWhen a party opens the door to evidence, he cannot claim prejudice from its admission.Â  State v. Robinson, 305 S.C. 469, 474, 409 S.E.2d 404, 408 (1991); State v. Young, 364 S.C. 476, 485, 613 S.E.2d 386, 391 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nDuring the Stateâ€™s direct examination, Tolliver admitted pleading guilty to the crimes involved in this case but denied both participating in these crimes and knowing Dublin at the time of their commission.Â  The prosecutor then asked Tolliver whether he gave a statement and asked where he was when he gave it.Â  Tolliver said he gave a statement to the police in Orangeburg.Â  The State asked Tolliver if he testified in a trial in Orangeburg. Â Tolliver answered in the affirmative.Â  The prosecutor continued to ask about the contents of his statement.Â  Tolliver confirmed it was written by the police in Orangeburg.Â  At the end of the direct examination, Tolliver claimed he was innocent despite pleading guilty.Â  When asked why he would plead guilty for a crime he claimed he never committed, Tolliver said, â€œI have my reasons.â€Â  \r\nOn cross-examination, defense counsel also spent significant time attempting to impeach Tolliver.Â  Tolliver admitted to being arrested in \r\nOrangeburg County because of his involvement in Orangeburg crimes and to knowing the State could seek the death penalty against him.Â  Defense counsel then established the Orangeburg and Aiken authorities worked together and offered a plea bargain to Tolliver in exchange for his testimony.Â  Tolliver admitted pleading guilty to the Orangeburg and Aiken crimes in order to get a much shorter sentence.Â  \r\nAt the conclusion of Tolliverâ€™s cross-examination, the State requested a bench conference.Â  The State argued defense counsel opened the door when he asked Tolliver about the plea agreement and specific details of the Orangeburg murder.Â  Defense counsel argued he did not open the door but simply responded to the questions asked by the State in direct examination.Â  On re-direct, Tolliver confirmed Dublinâ€™s involvement in the Orangeburg crimes.Â  \r\nAssuming arguendo that the trial court erred in holding defense counsel opened the door, we find the admission of that evidence did not prejudice Dublin. Â Error without prejudice does not warrant reversal.Â  Locklair, 341 S.C. at 365, 535 S.E.2d at 427.Â  An error is harmless if the defendantâ€™s guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other result could have been reached.Â  State v. Johnson, 363 S.C. 53, 60, 609 S.E.2d 520, 524 (2005).\r\nIn the present case, the eyewitnesses to the crime (Corbitt, Jones, and Duncan) gave nearly identical testimony regarding the events of April 10, 1998.Â  Corbitt and Jones identified Dublin as the individual who shot Rainey.Â  Dublinâ€™s girlfriend at the time, Patricia Williams, testified about a prior conversation she had with Dublin in which he admitted his involvement in the Aiken murder and provided details only an active participant could know.Â  She also testified Dublin owned a nine-millimeter weapon at the time of the offenses. Â Her testimony is consistent with the evidence indicating nine-millimeter bullets were recovered from the body of Rainey.\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-583","title":"State v.

McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, of Columbia, and Druanne Dykes White, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Rodriques MontezPickens appeals his conviction for trafficking crack cocaine, arguing the trial court erred (1) in failing to suppress crack cocaine that he contends was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment, (2) in charging the jury regarding constructive possession and knowledge, and (3) in allowing the State to introduce evidence that improperly commented on his character.Â  None of Pickensâ€™ arguments are preserved for appellate review. \r\nFACTS\r\nOn August 29, 2002, the Anderson County Sherrifâ€™s Office received a complaint that the driver of a black Lincoln Town car may be selling drugs in a neighborhood in Anderson County.Â  As a result, police officer Donnie Blassingame patrolled the neighborhood looking for a black Lincoln Town car.Â  Two other members of the department, Matthew Durham and Rodney Harbin, were in the same area and radioed to inform Blassingame they had spotted the car and followed it for several blocks.Â  \r\nBlassingame then caught sight of the car and recognized the driver as Pickens.Â  Blassingame informed Durham that Pickens did not possess a valid driverâ€™s license, and Durham called dispatch to confirm Pickens did not have a valid driverâ€™s license.Â  Blassingame attempted to follow Pickens, but lost sight of him.Â  Later, Durham and Harbin saw the car parked in front of Boldenâ€™s Shop, an auto repair shop.Â  Durham saw Pickens get out of the car and open the hood.Â  Someone came out of the shop and looked under the hood with Pickens, then Pickens started walking across the four-lane highway in the direction of a restaurant.Â  \r\nDispatch informed the officers Pickens did not have a driverâ€™s license, so Durham and Harbin initiated contact with Pickens.Â  When prompted by the officerâ€™s questions, Pickens admitted he had been driving the car and did not possess a driverâ€™s license, so the officers arrested Pickens for driving without a license.Â  When asked for a vehicle registration card, Pickens indicted he was driving his motherâ€™s car but there might be a registration card in the car.Â  The officers escorted Pickens across the street to the auto repair shop where the car was parked.Â Â  The keys were still in the ignition, but the car was locked.Â  The car was equipped with a keypad entry system, but Pickens stated he did not know the code.Â  Durham â€œplayed aroundâ€ with the keypad, and the door opened.Â  Durham searched the car and found 91.88 grams of crack cocaine and scales in a shoe bag under the driverâ€™s seat.Â  When Blassingame arrived on the scene he conducted an inventory search of the car because the officerâ€™s had the car towed away and impounded.Â  \r\nPickens was charged with trafficking crack cocaine.Â  A jury found him guilty, and he was sentenced to eighteen years incarceration.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\n LAW/ANALYSIS&nbsp;    \r\nPickens argues the trial court erred in failing to suppress the crack cocaine that he contends was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. We find this issue is not preserved for our review. \r\nIn order for an issue to be preserved for appellate review, it must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge.Â  Issues not raised and ruled upon in the trial court will not be considered on appeal.Â  State v. Dunbar,&nbsp;356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693-94&nbsp;(2003).Â  â€œConstitutional arguments are no exception to the rule, and if not raised to the trial court are deemed waived on appeal.â€Â  State v. Varvil, 338 S.C. 335, 339, 526 S.E.2d 248, 250 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\n&nbsp;\r\nPrior to the start of his trial, Pickens made a motion to exclude the crack cocaine the officers seized from the car.Â  Pickens argued the search was conducted without a warrant and was not a valid search incident to arrest.Â  The State argued the officers conducted a valid inventory search which would have led to the inevitable discovery of the crack cocaine regardless of whether the search incident to arrest was valid. Â In response, Pickensâ€™ counsel stated, â€œI donâ€™t take any issue with the inventory.â€Â  When the trial court questioned Pickensâ€™ counsel regarding the inevitable discovery issue, he stated, â€œ[T] hose issues will be developed with the testimony.Â  My objection was to the search incident to arrest.â€Â  The trial court denied the motion to suppress on the basis the inventory search was valid and did not rule on the legality of the search incident to arrest.Â  When the State sought to admit the crack cocaine into evidence at trial, Pickensâ€™ attorney acknowledged that he had no objection.Â  \r\nPickensâ€™ argument on appeal that the inventory search was illegal is not preserved because he never raised the issue to the trial judge.Â  Dunbar,&nbsp;356 S.C. at 142, 587 S.E.2d at 693-94 (â€œIssues not raised and ruled upon in the trial court will not be considered on appeal.â€)Â  Additionally, although Pickens argued the search incident to arrest was invalid during the in limine hearing, he did not object when the crack cocaine was introduced into evidence.Â  Therefore, this issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  State v. Mueller, 319 S.C. 266, 268, 460 S.E.2d 409, 410 (Ct. App. 1995) (â€œBecause the evidence developed during trial may warrant a change in the ruling, the losing party must renew his objection at trial when the evidence is presented in order to preserve the issue for appeal.â€) \r\nPickens argues the trial courtâ€™s jury charge on constructive possession failed to adequately instruct the jury regarding the Stateâ€™s burden to prove Pickens had knowledge the crack cocaine was concealed in the car.Â  This issue is not preserved for review.Â  \r\nAfter the trial judge gave the charge, he excused the jury and asked Pickens if he had any objections.Â  Pickensâ€™ attorney responded, â€œI have no additions or exceptions your honor.â€Â  Because Pickens failed to make any objection to the jury charge, we find the adequacy of the instruction is not preserved for our review.Â  State v. Avery, 333 S.C. 284, 296, 509 S.E.2d 476, 483 (1999) (holding a jury charge is not preserved for appellate review unless the party objects); see also Rule 20(b), SCRCP (â€œNotwithstanding any request for legal instructions, the parties shall be given the opportunity to object to the giving or failure to give an instruction before the jury retires, but out of the hearing of the jury. Any objection shall state distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds for objection. Failure to object in accordance with this rule shall constitute a waiver of objection.â€)Â Â Â  \r\nPickens argues the trial court erred in allowing the State to introduce evidence that improperly commented on his character.Â  This issue is not preserved for our review.Â  \r\nAt trial, Blassingame testified he was working the R Street neighborhood in Anderson â€œdue to a complaint we received from citizens of some unknown activities during the mornings, evenings, and late at night.â€Â  Pickens objected on the ground the testimony was hearsay, but the trial judge overruled the objection.Â  The next witness, Durham, testified that he and Harbin were investigating â€œcomplaints about a drug house located on R Street . . . we had talked to several people about the traffic going in and out all hours of the night.â€Â  The trial judge overruled Pickensâ€™ hearsay objection.Â  Durham continued his testimony as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n  We talked to one neighbor who lived right in front of it.Â  Gave us a couple of tags on some vehicles they had observed coming in and out and staying short times.Â  And one of them was a Lincoln that was occupied by a black male that supposedly came to the residence, would stay only a few minutes and get back in the car and leave. Â \r\n\r\nPickens once again objected to the testimony on the basis that it was hearsay.Â  The trial judge sustained the objection, ruling the statement was hearsay that went far beyond explaining why the officers were investigating the area.Â  Pickens did not make a motion to strike or request a curative instruction.Â  Durham then testified the house he was investigating â€œwas a house where crack cocaine was being sold out of.â€Â  Pickens objected, and the trial judge sustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard the statement.Â  \r\nOn appeal, Pickens argues the aforementioned testimony, when taken together, constituted an improper comment on his character because the statements identified him, as the driver of the Lincoln Town car, as a suspected drug dealer.Â  However, Pickens did not object to the testimony on that ground at trial.Â  Therefore, this issue is not preserved for review on appeal.Â  State v. McCray, 332 S.C. 536, 542, 506 S.E.2d 301, 303 (1998) (holding a party cannot argue one ground at trial and another on appeal).Â  Accordingly, Pickensâ€™ conviction is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-584","title":"Responsible Economic Development v.

Jerry Hewitt own the property at issue.[2]Â  These properties are located in Florence on Beltline Drive and Hoffmeyer Road, across the street from a high school and near a Samâ€™s Club.Â  The Planâ€™s land use map and matrix designate the properties for Business-Industrial uses, specifically including â€œBig Box Retail.â€Â  Originally, the Trinity property was zoned rural and residential, and the Hewitt property was not zoned.Â  \r\nOn March 16, 2000, Trinity submitted an application to amend the zoning of its property to general business.Â  On March 20, 2000, the Planning Commission posted signs on the Trinity property that advertised a public hearing on the proposed rezoning.Â  The Planning Commission also advertised the public hearing in a local weekly newspaper, the News Journal, on March 22, 2000.Â  On April 11, 2000, the Planning Commission held the public hearing.Â  The Florence City Council approved the rezoning request on June 12, 2000.Â  \r\nOn April 26, 2001, Hewitt submitted an application to the Planning Commission to annex his property to the City and to zone his property general business.Â  Notice of a public hearing appeared in the News Journal on May 2, 2001.Â  On May 3, 2001, the Planning Commission posted signs on the Hewitt property advertising the public hearing.Â  On May 22, 2001, the Planning Commission held the public hearing.Â  The Florence City Council approved the annexation and zoning of the Hewitt property on July 9, 2001.Â  \r\nFor purposes of this appeal, the ultimate zoning determination of the subject properties for commercial use was wholly consistent with the projected use as contemplated by the Plan.\r\nWal-Mart currently has an option to purchase the Trinity and Hewitt properties.Â  Wal-Mart intends to develop the property and construct a SuperCenter and shopping complex.Â  On July 22, 2003, Wal-Mart submitted a conceptual site plan to the Planning Commission.Â  \r\nThe members of RED own residential property in the Lakewood Subdivision near or adjacent to the proposed Wal-Mart development.Â  RED responded to Wal-Martâ€™s application with concerns about its effect on the Lakewood Subdivision.Â  In response to REDâ€™s concerns, Wal-Mart made several modifications to its conceptual site plan.Â  On October 29, 2003, after a series of correspondence between and among Wal-Mart, Wal-Martâ€™s engineers, the Planning Commission, and RED, the Planning Commission held a work session open to the public to discuss the major issues associated with the Wal-Mart development.Â  RED made a presentation at this work session.Â  On November 25, 2003, the Planning Commission approved Wal-Martâ€™s final site plan by a 7-2 vote.Â  \r\nOn December 23, 2003, RED filed a petition for judicial review of the decision of the Planning Commission and sought a declaratory order that the actions of the Planning Commission violated the substantive and procedural rights of its members.Â  On November 2, 2004, the circuit court issued an order dismissing the appeal and the petition for judicial review.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nÂ â€œIn the context of zoning, a decision of a reviewing body . . . will not be disturbed if there is evidence in the record to support its decision.â€Â  Rest. Row Assocs. v. Horry County, 335 S.C. 209, 215, 516 S.E.2d 442, 446&nbsp;(1999); Peterson Outdoor Adver. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 327 S.C. 230, 235, 489 S.E.2d 630, 632 (1997).Â  â€œA court will refrain from substituting its judgment for that of the reviewing body, even if it disagrees with the decision.â€Â  Rest. Row Assocs., 335 S.C. at 216, 516 S.E.2d at 446; Peterson, 327 S.C. at 235, 489 S.E.2d at 632.Â  Zoning is a legislative function, and this court will refrain from second guessing a zoning authorityâ€™s decision if the decision is fairly debatable.Â  Petersen v. City of Clemson, 312 S.C. 162, 172, 439 S.E.2d 317, 323 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  â€œHowever, a decision of a municipal zoning board will be overturned if it is arbitrary, capricious, has no reasonable relation to a lawful purpose, or if the board has abused its discretion.â€Â  Rest. Row Assocs., 335 S.C. at 216, 516 S.E.2d at 446; Peterson, 327 S.C. at 235, 489 S.E.2d at 633.Â  This court is not permitted to disturb any of the circuit courtâ€™s findings of fact if there is any evidence to support them.Â  Petersen, 312 S.C at 169, 439 S.E.2d at 322 (Ct. App. 1993) (citing Bishop v. Hightower, 292 S.C. 358, 356 S.E.2d 420 (Ct. App. 1987).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nRED argues the circuit court erred in upholding the Planning Commissionâ€™s decision to approve the Wal-Mart SuperCenter because: (1) the zoning of the Trinity and Hewitt properties was illegally accomplished; and (2) the Zoning Ordinance and Regulations do not comply with the Act or the Comprehensive Plan.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe circuit court found REDâ€™s challenges were barred as filed outside the applicable statute of limitations.Â  We find no error in this determination.Â  South Carolina Code Ann. Section 6-29-760(D) (2004) precludes any challenge to the adequacy of notice or validity of a zoning regulation or map, or amendment to it sixty days after the decision of the governing body, if there has been substantial compliance with the notice requirements of the Act or with locally established procedures.Â  REDâ€™s challenges came more than two years after the properties were rezoned.Â  Thus, RED had the burden of showing that the Planning Commission failed to substantially comply with the notice requirements of the Act or the Zoning Ordinance.Â  We find, as the circuit court did, that substantial compliance was met.\r\nI.Â  Substantial Compliance with Notice Requirements\r\n1.Â  Newspaper of General Circulation\r\nBoth section 9.5 of the Zoning Ordinance and South Carolina Code Ann. Section 6-29-760(A) (2004) provide that, prior to rezoning property, the Planning Commission must hold a public hearing and advertise the time and place of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation. Â In the present case, the notice of the zoning applications was published in the News Journal, a free publication that has a circulation of 25,000.Â  RED contends the News Journal does not meet the â€œnewspaper of general circulationâ€ requirement because notice may have been more effective if run in a paper with a larger circulation and with paid subscribers.Â Â Â  \r\nWe agree with the circuit courtâ€™s finding that the News Journal is a newspaper of general circulation as required by the Act and the Zoning Ordinance.Â  â€œFor a publication to be considered a newspaper of general circulation, it must contain items of general interest to the public.â€Â  58 Am. Jur. 2d Newspapers, Periodicals, and Press Associations Â§ 37 (2005).Â  RED makes no contention the News Journal does not contain items of general interest to the public.Â  Further, neither the Zoning Ordinance nor the Act require publication in the largest newspaper or in a paper with paid subscribers.Â  \r\n2.Â  Signage\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Section 6-29-760(A) (2004) requires that the affected property be posted with conspicuous notice visible from each right of way upon which the property abuts.Â  Section 9.5 of the Zoning Ordinance is analogous to section 6-29-760(A) with the added requirement that one notice is to be posted for every 200 feet of road frontage, advising of the nature of the change, and the time, date, and place of the hearing.Â  In this case, the signage posted on the two properties contained a large â€œZâ€, stated â€œZONING CHANGE PROPOSEDâ€, and included a telephone number that members of the public could use to request more information.[3]Â  While exacting compliance with the Zoning Ordinance was lacking here, we concur with the circuit court in finding that substantial compliance was demonstrated.Â  \r\nSouth Carolina case law does not specifically define substantial compliance in the context of S.C. Code Ann. Section 6-29-760(D) (2004).Â  However, American jurisprudence generally holds substantial compliance is met if the purpose of the statute is achieved.Â  See James v. County of Kitsap, 115 P.3d 286, 293 (Wash. 2005) (substantial compliance means a court should determine whether a statute has been followed sufficiently so as to carry out the intent for which the statute was adopted); Iowa State Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Michel, 683 N.W.2d 95, 105 (Iowa 2004) (in deciding whether a party has substantially complied with a statutory requirement, the court evaluates whether the asserted compliance assures that the reasonable objectives of the statute will be met); Rosenblatt v. City of Houston, 31 S.W.3d 399, 404 (Tex. Ct. App. 2000) (â€œSubstantial compliance has been defined to mean performance of the essential requirements of a statute.â€); Morrow v. Bobbit, 943 S.W.2d 384, 389 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1996) (substantial compliance is met when it is reasonable to conclude that the objective sought by the statute has been fully attained); Thrash v. City of Asheville, 393 S.E.2d 842, 845 (N.C. 1990) (â€œSubstantial compliance means compliance with the essential requirements of the statute.â€); Sabatini v. Jayhawk Const. Co., Inc., 520 P.2d 1230, 1234 (Kan. 1974) (â€œSubstantial compliance requires compliance in respect to the essential matters necessary to assure every reasonable objective of the statute.â€); Brow v. Sherwin-Williams Co., 109 N.E.2d 864, 866-67 (Ohio 1952) (the requirements of a procedural statute are met when the municipality substantially complies with the statuteâ€™s procedural mandates, which requires the municipality to act in a way to achieve the purpose of the statute).Â  \r\nThe decisions in South Carolina are in full accord with the above cited cases.Â  See, e.g., Quality Towing, Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 345 S.C. 156, 164-65, 547 S.E.2d 862, 866&nbsp;(2001) (looking to the clear language and express purpose of a federal act to determine whether substantial compliance occurred); Davis v. NationsCredit Fin. Servs. Corp., 326 S.C. 83, 86, 484 S.E.2d 471, 472&nbsp;(1997) (looking to the purpose of a statute in determining whether substantial compliance occurred).Â  \r\nIn the present case, the objectives sought to be achieved by the notice requirements were, in fact, met.Â  The purpose of the posting requirement is to put interested parties on notice of a public hearing.Â  The record reveals that an official of the high school across the street knew to inquire further about the Trinity zoning change because a representative was present at the public hearing.Â  Additionally, as to the Hewitt zoning, a number of telephone calls were received from members of the public, inquiring about the change.Â  Accordingly, there is evidence to support the circuit courtâ€™s determination that the technical noncompliance of the signage does not defeat a finding of substantial compliance.Â  See Morrow, 943 S.W.2d at 389 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1996).\r\n3.Â  Notice to Adjacent Landowners\r\nFinally, RED contends the Planning Commission did not provide notice to adjoining landowners, as required by the Act and the Zoning Ordinance.Â  We, however, join the circuit court in finding that REDâ€™s argument has no basis in law.Â  Neither the Act nor the Zoning Ordinance requires individual, written notice of the zoning application.Â  In any event, RED cannot overcome the fact of substantial compliance.\r\nII.Â  Â Â  Consideration of Surrounding Land Uses\r\nRED contends the Planning Commission failed to consider the current use of land surrounding the Trinity property during its rezoning and the Hewitt property during its annexation and zoning.Â  As noted above, we find that this argument is barred as filed outside the applicable statute of limitations, South Carolina Code Ann. Section 6-29-760(D) (2004).Â  Regardless, we agree with the circuit courtâ€™s conclusion that this argument fails on the merits.Â  \r\nThe record reveals surrounding uses were identified with respect to the zoning of both the Trinity and Hewitt properties.Â  The graphics and pictures attached to the staff reports show the uses abutting the Trinity and Hewitt properties, geographically and by legend, to include subdivision use.Â  The Planning Commission, therefore, did consider the use of the land surrounding the Trinity and Hewitt properties.Â  The fact that this â€œconsiderationâ€ did not culminate in the result sought by RED does not advance its position on appeal. \r\nIII.&nbsp; Alleged Failure to Comply with the Act and the Comprehensive Plan in Zonings\r\nRED contends the rezoning of the Trinity property and annexation and zoning of the Hewitt property must be set aside for failing to comply with the Act and the Plan.Â  Again, we find this argument barred under South Carolina Code Ann. Section 6-29-760(D) (2004).Â  However, this argument also fails on the merits.\r\nThe circuit court found that the Zoning Ordinance, Regulations, and Plan are all consistent.Â  We agree.Â  As noted above, the land use map and matrix incorporated by the Plan designate the Hewitt property and Trinity property for Business-Industrial uses, including â€œBig Box Retail.â€Â  The zoning of these properties is â€œB-3,â€ general business.Â  The ultimate zoning determinationâ€”for commercial useâ€”tracks the Planâ€™s projected use for these properties.Â  Because there is consistency between the Plan and the subsequent zoning, we need not address any phantom dispute or conflict between the Plan and the Zoning Ordinance.Â  REDâ€™s argument is without merit.Â Â Â  \r\nFinally, in view of this courtâ€™s deferential standard of review and the fact that we find the Planning Commissionâ€™s decision at least fairly debatable, we refrain from second guessing its decision.Â  See Petersen, 312 S.C. at 165, 439 S.E.2d at 320.\r\nIV.Â  Alleged Failure to Consider and Apply the Comprehensive Plan to the Wal-Mart Project\r\nRED contends the Planning Commission failed to consider and apply the Plan in approving the Wal-Mart project.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nFirst, we find that the Plan is consistent with the Wal-Mart project.Â  As discussed above, the Plan originally designated the property on which the SuperCenter will be built as appropriate for Business-Industrial use.Â  The SuperCenter fits that described use.Â  Second, the circuit court found no evidence that the Planning Commission acted arbitrarily or capriciously in approving the Wal-Mart project.Â  The record reveals this to be true as it provides the Wal-Mart project was granted only after thorough study, and after modifications were made by Wal-Mart in response to input by staff, the public, and members of RED.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe join the circuit court in finding that the Planning Commission substantially complied with the notice requirements of the Act and Zoning Ordinance in rezoning the Trinity property and annexing and zoning the Hewitt property.Â  Therefore, REDâ€™s challenge to this decision is procedurally barred pursuant to section 6-29-760(D) of the South Carolina Code (2004).Â  In addition, we concur in the finding that the Planning Commission did not act arbitrarily, capriciously, or in abuse of its discretion in approving Wal-Martâ€™s application.Â  The circuit court order dismissing REDâ€™s petition for judicial review is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., STILWELL, and KITTREDGE, JJ. concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â S.C.

Brailsford, III, of Edisto Island, 7805 Russell Creek Dr., for Amicus Curiae. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Newberry Electric Cooperative, Inc., (the Cooperative) brought an action pursuant to section 58-27-1360 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004), seeking to require the City of Newberry (the City) to purchase certain electric facilities in an area newly annexed by the City.Â  After an arbitration panel determined the fair value of the facilities, the City brought a declaratory judgment action in circuit court seeking a declaration of its legal rights and obligations under section 58-27-1360 as applied to the arbitration decision.Â  The City now appeals the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal of its action and denial of its petition for declaratory judgment.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nIn March 2003, the Cooperative served the City with its Notice of Exercise of Right to Compel Purchase of Facilities and Property and Payment of Just Compensation and Notice to Appoint Representative.Â  The Cooperative served the notice to invoke its rights under section 58-27-1360 to receive just compensation from the city for certain facilities owned by the Cooperative and within an area annexed by the City.Â  The notice identified five project areas for which the Cooperative sought compensation and set forth an amount of approximately $6 million for compensation.Â  \r\nThe City filed a Return to Notice.Â  It responded with its own figure for just compensation of approximately $113,000.Â  The two sides were unable to reach a settlement regarding the amount of just compensation for the affected facilities.\r\nThe Cooperative and the City jointly moved the circuit court for an order of arbitration with certain procedures and conditions agreed upon by the parties.Â  The arbitration panel would consist of three individuals and would determine the amount of just compensation owed to the Cooperative by the City.Â  The order provided in part:\r\n\r\n  (e)Â Â Â Â  the decision of the Arbitration Panel shall be determined by the vote of at least two of the arbiters, and the written decision of the Panel shall consist only of the following:\r\n  â€œJust compensation to Newberry Electric Cooperative, Inc. (including reasonable expenses, engineersâ€™ and attorneysâ€™ fees per S.C. Code Â§ 58-27-1260) is determined to be $_________.â€Â  (Emphasis added).Â  \r\n\r\nThe above amount was the only determination to be made by the arbitration panel pursuant to the consent order of the parties.Â  The provision did not require any explanation of the amount or how it was derived.Â  The parties each provided the arbitration panel with documentary exhibits and oral argument.Â  \r\nThe panel allowed the parties to submit proposed decisions and awards.Â  The Cityâ€™s proposal allowed for just compensation of $282,989.Â  The proposal also set forth specific findings regarding the facilities, the reintegration of the Cooperativeâ€™s facilities, and the impact on the customers served by the affected facilities.Â  The Cooperative also submitted a detailed proposal including findings regarding the facilities and customers.Â  The Cooperative suggested a just compensation award of $6,243,299.69.Â  \r\nIn September 2003, the panel returned a decision and award in the format provided by the order and listed the amount of just compensation as $3,853,639.14.Â  The panel did not provide any explanation as to how the figure was derived or what the Cooperative was required to expend on reintegration of the facilities.Â  The panel did exactly as asked by the parties and only calculated a figure for just compensation.Â  Neither the City nor the Cooperative asked the panel to clarify the award or filed an appeal from this award.Â  Furthermore, neither party asked the circuit court to vacate or modify the award pursuant to the Uniform Arbitration Act, sections 15-48-10 through 15-48-240 of the South Carolina Code (2005).\r\nInstead, the City brought this declaratory judgment action, seeking a declaration of its rights and obligations under section 58-27-1360 by the circuit court.Â  In the alternative, the City asked the circuit court to remand the issue to the arbitration panel for â€œclarification, amendment or alteration of the Decision and Award sufficient to resolve the factual issues concerning facilities, properties, customers, loss of revenue and reintegration . . . .â€Â  The Cooperative moved to dismiss the action.\r\nThe circuit court issued an order denying the petition for declaratory judgment and dismissing the action.Â  The court found the award was in precisely the form of decision set forth in the consent order and the City had waived any right to object to the form and nature of the award.Â  It held the award was final and binding and not subject to collateral attack under the guise of a declaratory judgment action.Â  Finally, the court found the Cooperative brought the action for just compensation, specifically setting forth the facilities, properties, reintegration, and customers involved.Â  The court concluded the Arbitration Panel had at least a barely colorable factual and legal basis upon which to find that the Cooperativeâ€™s plan was reasonable and that the just compensation due to the Cooperative was in the amount of $3,853,639.14.Â  The City filed a Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment, which the circuit court denied.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe City argues the trial court erred in failing to remand the arbitration decision to the arbitration panel for clarification of the rights and obligations of the parties under its decision.Â  The City maintains section 58-27-1360 contains several specific factors to consider in reaching just compensation, and the trial court should have required a specific determination of the amount allocated to the various factors.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 58-27-1360 lists three components of the â€œjust compensationâ€ a city must pay a cooperative:Â  (a) the cost of the facilities being acquired; (b) the cost of reintegrating the system, and (c) an additional amount in recognition of lost revenue from consumers the cooperative loses in the transaction.Â Â  The statute does not require the arbitrators to make specific finding of fact for each component or delineate the amount it awarded for each factor.Â  See Taylor v. Atlantic Beach Election Commâ€™n, 363 S.C. 8, 15, 609 S.E.2d 500, 503 (2005) (finding circuit court did not err in refusing to remand matter to election commission for more definitive findings and rulings in a written order where election statute does not require a written order containing findings of fact or conclusions of law).Â  Furthermore, the consent order compelling arbitration did not require such findings.Â  Rather, it limited the arbitration panelâ€™s written decision, providing:Â  â€œthe written decision of the Panel shall consist only of the following: â€˜Just compensation to Newberry Electric Cooperative, Inc. . . . is determined to be $_______.â€™â€Â  (Emphasis added).Â  The arbitration panelâ€™s decision was in this exact form, inserting the dollar amount for just compensation.Â  \r\nAlthough the City now claims to be unsatisfied with the form of this ruling, it did not seek clarification of the award from the arbitration panel.Â  The Uniform Arbitration Act sets forth a procedure for a party to seek clarification of a ruling.Â  S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-100 (2005).Â  Our supreme court held if a party submits an issue for arbitration and the arbitrators fail to clearly rule on the issue in the award, the party must request the arbitrators address the issue pursuant to section15-48-100.Â  Renaissance Enterprises, Inc. v. Ocean Resorts, Inc., 330 S.C. 13, 19, 496 S.E.2d 858, 861 (1998).Â  If a party fails to do so, the issue will not be preserved for further review.Â  Id.Â  at 19-20, 496 S.E.2d at 862.Â  Even if the Uniform Arbitration Act does not apply, the parties expressly adopted the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure to apply to the arbitration.Â  Thus, under Rule 59(e), SCRCP, the City may have asked for clarification of the order.Â  It is well established that an issue not ruled on by the trial judge is not preserved for appellate review unless the issue is raised in a post-trial motion.Â  Rickborn v. Liberty Life Ins. Co., 321 S.C. 291, 468 S.E.2d 292 (1996).Â  Like other civil proceedings, the arbitrators must rule on the issue in order to preserve it for further review.Â  Renaissance, 330 S.C. at 20, 496 S.E.2d at 862.Â  \r\nThe City, however, failed to avail itself of either procedure to seek clarification of the arbitration panelâ€™s decision directly from the panel.Â  Rather, it filed this declaratory judgment action.Â  Pursuant to section 58-27-1360, the arbitration panelâ€™s â€œdecision on just compensation, . . . is final and binding on the parties.â€Â  In its brief, the City stresses that it is not seeking judicial review of the arbitration panelâ€™s decision. Rather, the City appears to be attempting to collaterally attack the decision of the arbitration panel by means of a declaratory judgment action.Â Â  Appellate courts have â€œrefused to allow collateral attacks under the guise of a declaratory judgment action upon the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.â€Â  Charleston County Sch. Dist. v. S.C. State Ports Auth., 283 S.C. 48, 52320 S.E.2d 727, 730 (Ct. App. 1984) (citing Henry v. Cottingham, 253 S.C. 286, 170 S.E.2d 387 (1969); Jackson v. Cannon, 266 S.C. 198, 222 S.E.2d 494 (1976)).Â  We agree with the circuit court that the City waived the right to object to the form and nature of the award.Â  We find the City cannot now challenge the merits of the award by the arbitration panel.\r\nAs to the Cityâ€™s desire to have the circuit court remand the decision to the panel for further explanation, we find the court properly denied the petition.Â  The decision of the panel fully complied with the mandate issued by the circuit court and was in the form agreed upon by the parties.Â  See Pittman Mortgage Co., Inc. v.

Barr, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nDuke K. McCall, Jr., of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this workersâ€™ compensation action, the single commissioner determined Waymon Hendrixâ€™s claim was barred by the applicable statute of limitations, S.C. Code Ann. Section 42-15-40 (Supp. 2004), and there was no evidence of estoppel or waiver on the part of Employer J. D. Hollingsworth (Hollingsworth).Â  An appellate panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (the Commission) adopted the single commissionerâ€™s findings of fact.Â  The circuit court affirmed.Â  Hendrix appeals, arguing the discovery rule applies to his case, and consequently, his claim is within the statute of limitations.Â  Hendrix further contends the doctrine of estoppel bars Hollingsworth from asserting the statute of limitations.Â  We affirm[1] pursuant to Rule 220(b)(2), SCACR and the following authorities:\r\n1.Â  We find Hendrixâ€™s assignment of error in connection with the discovery rule was first raised to the circuit court and not the Commission.Â  Accordingly, it is not preserved for review by this court.Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilkie, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€); Rodney v. Michelin Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 515, 517, 466 S.E.2d 357, 358 (1996) (â€œArguments not raised to the workersâ€™\r\ncompensation commission or to the circuit court are not preserved for appeal.â€).Â  Nevertheless, assuming the applicability of the discovery rule, we find application of the rule would not alter the ultimate resultâ€”Hendrix filed his claim outside the statute of limitations.Â  The record reveals Hendrix was diagnosed early on with the injury that gave rise to his claim.Â  On at least three separate occasionsâ€”in December 1999, January 2000, and February 2000â€”Hendrix was diagnosed with a finding of â€œpositive impingementâ€ to his right shoulder.Â  Thus, the statute of limitations had run prior to the filing of the claim in May 2002.Â  Mauldin v. Dyna-Color/Jack Rabbit, 308 S.C. 18, 20, 416 S.E.2d 639, 640 (1992) (under the discovery rule, the statute of limitations begins to run from the date a claimant either knew or should have known of his compensable injury); Johnston v. Bowen, 313 S.C. 61, 64, 437 S.E.2d 45, 47 (1993) (injured party must act with some promptness where facts and circumstances of the injury would put a person of common knowledge and experience on notice that some right of his had been invaded or that some claim against another party might exist; statute of limitations begins to run from this point and not when advice of counsel is sought or full-blown theory of recovery is developed).Â  \r\n2.Â  We find the substantial evidence supports the Commissionâ€™s rejection of Hendrixâ€™s reliance on the principles of estoppel and waiver to defeat the statute of limitations.Â  An appellate court must affirm the findings of the Commission if they are supported by substantial evidence.&nbsp;\r\nHargrove v. Titan Textile Co., 360 S.C. 276, 289, 599 S.E.2d 604, 610-11 (Ct. App. 2004); Grant v. Grant Textiles, 361 S.C. 188, 191, 603 S.E.2d 858, 859 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œA reviewing court will not overturn a decision by the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission unless the determination is unsupported by substantial evidence or is affected by an error of law.â€).Â  In regards to his injury, Hendrix testified he believed he â€œwas being taken care ofâ€ by Hollingsworth because he was sent to the company doctor, and all of his medical bills and mileage costs associated with his injury were paid for by Hollingsworth.Â  Additionally, Hendrix testified he was never informed by anyone at Hollingsworth that he needed to file anything, and he was simply â€œunder the impression that [he] was under Workmanâ€™s Comp.â€Â  There is no testimony in the record that any representative of Hollingsworth specifically told Hendrix that he would be taken care of.Â  See Hopkins v. Floydâ€™s Wholesale, 299 S.C. 127, 129, 382 S.E.2d 907, 908 (1989) (an employer may be estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a bar to subsequently filed workersâ€™ compensation suits if the employer induces the claimant to believe that the claim is compensable and will be taken care of without its being filed with the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission within the period limited); see also Poole v. E. I. Du Pont Nemours &amp; Co., 227 S.C. 232, 87 S.E.2d 640, 641 (1955) (South Carolina adheres to the general principle that waiver or estoppel will arise from conduct on the part of the employer or carrier from which it may be reasonably inferred that the claimant was misled or deceived, whether intentionally or not, and thereby failed to file his claim within the statute of limitations). \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nSTILWELL, KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-588","title":"Crowder v.

Morris, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The Charleston County Sheriffâ€™s Department and South Carolina Department of Education, Transportation Division (Appellants) appeal from a jury verdict awarding Scott Preston damages for injuries he sustained in a traffic accident with a school bus.Â  Appellants argue the trial court erred in permitting a police officer, qualified as an expert, to give opinion testimony regarding speed.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThis action arises out of a traffic accident that occurred on the morning of February 26, 2001.Â  Preston was driving his motorcycle when he approached an intersection where traffic was being directed by a crossing guard.Â  Meanwhile, a South Carolina Department of Education school bus approached the intersection and was directed by the crossing guard to proceed through the intersection.Â  Several witnesses later testified the school bus entered the intersection without properly stopping at the stop sign.Â  Although Preston attempted to avoid a collision by applying his brakes, he crashed into the side of the school bus.Â  Preston suffered multiple serious injuries, including a fractured left arm and dislocated wrist, a broken collarbone, multiple broken ribs, collapsed lungs, two broken legs, broken facial bones, and a metal rod was lodged in his right arm.Â  As a result of these injuries, Preston lost feeling in a portion of his face and has permanent metal supports in his legs and face. \r\nPreston filed a negligence action against Appellants seeking damages for injuries he sustained in the accident.Â  A jury found Preston was not entitled to damages because he was more than half at fault for the collision, but the trial judge, acting as the thirteenth juror, ordered a new trial.Â  During the subsequent trial, much testimony focused on Prestonâ€™s speed immediately preceding the accident.Â  Preston testified he was traveling over the 35 mph speed limit.Â  Angela Champion, who was driving the car traveling behind Preston, estimated Prestonâ€™s speed between 45 and 50 mph, and another witness, Angela Spalviero, testified Preston was â€œflying.â€ \r\nPreston proffered the testimony of the police officer who investigated the accident, Murray Abramson.Â  Appellants objected to Abramson giving an opinion regarding Prestonâ€™s speed, so the trial court examined Abramson outside of the juryâ€™s presence.Â  Abramson testified that based on his education and experience, he believed himself capable of estimating the probable speed of the motorcycle.Â  \r\nAfter qualifying him as an expert, the trial court allowed Abramson to offer his opinion regarding the motorcycleâ€™s speed prior to the accident.Â  At the scene of the accident, Abramson measured the motorcycleâ€™s skid marks at 90 feet, 11 inches.Â  Using a chart to estimate speed based on the length of skid marks, reaction time, and braking time, Abramson testified Preston was traveling at least 45 mph.Â  In response, James Jur, an accident reconstruction expert, offered his opinion that Preston was traveling between 53 and 61 mph before applying his brakes.Â  Jur explained that based on the length of the skid marks, the motorcycleâ€™s minimum speed was 45mph, but that his calculations took into account other factors not represented on the chart Abramson used.\r\nThe jury returned a verdict in the amount of $707,000.Â  However, the jury found Preston was 50% at fault for the accident, so the trial judge reduced the award by 50%.Â  The trial judge further reduced the damage award to $300,000, the statutory maximum as provided by the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-120 (2005).Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants argue the trial court judge abused his discretion by qualifying Abramson as an expert and allowing him to give an opinion as to the motorcycleâ€™s speed preceding the collision. We disagree.\r\nRule 702, SCRE permits expert opinion testimony and articulates the standard for admissibility as follows: â€œIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.â€Â  Qualification of an expert and the admission or exclusion of his testimony is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Goode, 305 S.C. 176, 177-78, 406 S.E.2d 391, 392-93 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  â€œThere is no abuse of discretion as long as the witness has acquired by study or practical experience such knowledge of the subject matter of his testimony as would enable him to give guidance and assistance to the jury in resolving a factual issue which is beyond the scope of the juryâ€™s good judgment and common knowledge.â€Â  Goode, 305 S.C. at 178, 406 S.E.2d at 393.Â  There is no exact requirement concerning how knowledge or skill must be acquired.Â  Id.Â  In order for this court to reverse a judgment for an alleged error in the exclusion or admission of evidence, the complaining party must prove both the error of the ruling and resulting prejudice.Â  Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 525, 595 S.E.2d 817, 825&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).\r\nMany South Carolina decisions have excluded the opinions of investigating police officers in automobile accident cases.Â  Gulledge v. McLaughlin, 328 S.C. 504, 508, 492 S.E.2d 816, 818 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  However, our courts have held that an investigating police officer may give opinion testimony if he is qualified as an expert.Â  Goode, 305 S.C. at 177, 406 S.E.2d at 392-93; see also State v. Kelly, 285 S.C. 373, 374, 329 S.E.2d 442, 443 (1985) (â€œA police officer may not give his opinions as to the cause of the accident.Â  He may only testify regarding his direct observations unless he is qualified as an expert.â€) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nHere, the trial court permitted Abramson to testify as an expert after assessing his qualifications, and we can discern no error in the trial courtâ€™s qualification of Abramson on the issue of speed. Â Abramson testified he had 16 years experience as a highway patrolman; received training at the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy; received instruction in advanced accident investigation at an institute in Florida, including training in estimating speed based on skid marks; and involvement in investigating hundreds of cases.Â  In light of Abramsonâ€™s training and experience, we find he could have provided assistance to the jury on the question of speed.Â  Moreover, any defect in the amount and quality of education and experience goes to the weight of the expertâ€™s testimony and not to its admissibility.Â  Lee v. Suess, 318 S.C. 283, 286, 457 S.E.2d 344, 346 (1995). \r\nEven if the trial court judge had abused his discretion by qualifying Abramson as an expert and allowing him to testify on the issue of speed, Appellants cannot show they were prejudiced as a result.Â  Abramsonâ€™s testimony was cumulative to several other witnessesâ€™ trial testimony, including that of the Appellantsâ€™ own expert, Jur.Â  See Gulledge, 328 S.C. at 509, 492 S.E.2d at 818 (holding cumulative testimony was an insufficient ground for reversal even though the trial court erred in permitting a non-expert patrolman to testify).Â  Abramson testified Preston was traveling â€œat least 45 mph.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  Preston himself admitted he was speeding, Champion estimated the motorcycleâ€™s speed at between 45 and 50 mph, and Spalviero testified that Preston was â€œflying.â€Â  Appellantsâ€™ expert, Jur, estimated the motorcycle was traveling at 53 to 61 mph, and he agreed that 45 mph was Prestonâ€™s minimum speed based on the length of the skid mark.Â  Therefore, Abramsonâ€™s testimony was cumulative.Â  Accordingly, the order of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.

Davis, Atwater &amp; Davis, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this workersâ€™ compensation case, the North Carolina Guaranty Association (N.C. Guaranty) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order reversing the Appellate Panel of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (Full Commission) and reinstating the Single Commissionerâ€™s findings.Â  The Full Commission held N.C. Guaranty was not bound by the Single Commissionerâ€™s order, which was issued during a stay mandated by the South Carolina Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association Act.Â  We reverse.Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn March 19, 2001, Willis filed a form 50 seeking benefits for a back injury sustained in the scope and course of his employment and requesting a hearing on the matter.Â  At the time of Willisâ€™s hearing request, Reliance National Indemnity Company (Reliance) was the insurance carrier.Â  Although the Single Commissioner timely notified Reliance that a hearing was scheduled for September 4, 2001, Reliance failed to respond by filing a form 51 or by appearing at the hearing.Â  Therefore, the Single Commissioner admitted Willisâ€™s Administrative Procedures Act submissions and heard Willisâ€™s testimony in Relianceâ€™s absence.Â  \r\nOn October 2, 2001, the State of Pennsylvania issued an order declaring Reliance insolvent.Â  At that time, all claims were turned over to the South Carolina Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association (S.C. Guaranty) for handling.Â  On November 6, 2001, the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission notified Willisâ€™s attorney that section 38-31-160 of the South Carolina Code (2002) mandated a 90-day stay for all suits and proceedings involving Reliance due to its insolvency.Â  \r\nThe Single Commissioner issued an order on November 19, 2001 and made the following findings of fact: Willis sustained a back injury in the course and scope of his employment on April 9, 1999, Reliance was responsible for payment of medical care and temporary total disability benefits from April 12, 1999 until September 6, 1999, and Willis sustained 51% permanent disability.Â  \r\nThereafter, Willisâ€™s attorney forwarded a copy of the Single Commissionerâ€™s order to S.C. Guaranty and requested payment.Â  On March 14, 2002 Willis sent a letter to S.C. Guaranty indicating he was informed that because Willis was a North Carolina resident, his claim would be referred to N.C. Guaranty and requesting contact information for N.C. Guaranty.Â  S.C. forwarded Willisâ€™s letter to N.C. Guaranty.Â  N.C. Guaranty contacted Willisâ€™s attorney to obtain information after it received notice of the claim on March 22, 2002. Â Willisâ€™s attorney sent a copy of Willisâ€™s file on April 17, 2002 and a copy of the complete workersâ€™ compensation package on May 7, 2002.Â  \r\nOn August 30, 2002, N.C. Guaranty filed a motion to reconsider or vacate the Single Commissionerâ€™s order, arguing it could not be legally bound by the Single Commissionerâ€™s decision.Â  By order dated September 20, 2002, the Single Commissioner denied the motion.Â  N.C. Guaranty requested review by the Full Commission.Â  By an order dated March 21, 2003, the Full Commission set aside the Single Commissionerâ€™s order and substituted its findings of fact.Â  The Full Commission found Willis was entitled to payment of 21 weeks of temporary total disability benefits and all related medical bills, but that the matter would be remanded to a jurisdictional commissioner for a hearing on the extent of Willisâ€™s permanent partial disability.Â  \r\nThereafter, Willis appealed to the circuit court, which reversed the order of the Full Commission and reinstated the Single Commissionerâ€™s order.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for judicial review of decisions of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co., 360 S.C. 276, 288, 599 S.E.2d 604, 610 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Pursuant to the APA, this courtâ€™s review is limited to deciding whether the commissionâ€™s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nN.C. Guaranty argues the circuit court erred in reversing the Full Commissionâ€™s decision, which vacated the Single Commissionerâ€™s order and remanded Willisâ€™ partial permanent disability claim to permit N.C. Guaranty to defend on the merits.Â  N.C. Guaranty contends the Single Commissioner exceeded his authority by issuing a final ruling during the mandated 90 day stay period and that the Full Commission correctly set aside that order.Â  We agree.[1]Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-31-1 to 93, provides protection for insureds in the event their insurance carriers become insolvent by providing payment for covered claims.Â  S.C. Prop. and Cas. Ins. Guar. Assâ€™n v. Carolinaâ€™s Roofing and Sheet Metal Contractorâ€™s Self-Insurers Fund, 303 S.C. 368, 369, 401 S.E.2d 144, 145 (1991).Â  Section 38-31-160 of the Act provides a mandatory automatic 90-day stay for all claims against an insolvent insurer: â€œAll proceedings involving covered claims in which the insolvent insurer is a party or is obligated to defend a party in any court in this State must be stayed ninety days from the date insolvency is determined to permit proper defense by the association.â€Â Â  \r\nIn the case sub judice, the Single Commissioner held a hearing on September 4, 2001, but didnâ€™t issue a final, written order until November 19, 2001.Â  The Single Commissioner clearly issued his decision after the mandatory 90-day stay went into effect on October 2, 2001, the date Reliance was declared insolvent.Â  First Union Natâ€™l Bank of S.C. v. Hitman, Inc., 306 S.C. 327, 329, 411 S.E.2d 681, 682 (Ct. App. 1991) (holding an order is not final until it is written and entered); see also Rule 58(a), SCRCP (judgment not effective until entered in the record).Â  Because the Single Commissioner was without authority to issue a final written order during the mandatory stay period, the order dated November 19, 2001 was void ab initio.Â  See Turner v. Malone, 24 S.C. 398 (1886) (holding a judgment or order entered without jurisdiction is void ab initio); see also Webster v. Clanton, 259 S.C. 387, 391, 192 S.E.2d 214, 216 (1972) (explaining that an order issued without jurisdiction is void and a void order has no legal effect); cf Ex parte Reichlyn, 310 S.C. 495, 499, 427 S.E.2d 661, 663 (1993) (holding judgment entered in violation of the automatic stay in a bankruptcy proceeding is void because the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to take any action inconsistent with the stay).Â  Therefore, the Full Commission properly decided N.C. Guaranty could not be legally bound by the November 19, 2001 order.\r\nN.C. Guaranty also argues the trial court erred in reinstating the Single Commissionerâ€™s order.Â  N.C. Guaranty contends the Full Commissionâ€™s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence and should be affirmed.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe Full Commission is the ultimate fact finder in workersâ€™ compensation cases and is not bound by the single commissionerâ€™s findings of fact.Â  Gibson v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. No. 3, 338 S.C. 510, 517, 526 S.E.2d 725, 729. Â â€œA reviewing court should affirm a decision by the Full Commission unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the substantial evidence on the whole record.â€Â  Gray v. Club Group, Ltd., 339 S.C. 173, 183, 528 S.E.2d 435, 440 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\nHaving decided the Single Commissionerâ€™s order dated November 19, 2001 was void ab initio, we reverse the circuit courtâ€™s order reinstating the Single Commissionerâ€™s findings.Â  Because the Full Commission is the ultimate finder of fact in a workersâ€™ compensation case and its order was not issued during the automatic stay period, we uphold the order dated March 21, 2003.Â  N.C. Guaranty is not seeking to escape liability for the claim.Â  The Full Commission ordered N.C. Guaranty to pay Willis 21 weeks of temporary total disability benefits and all related medical bills. Moreover, the Full Commission simply remanded the issue of permanent partial disability to allow N.C. Guaranty the opportunity to defend the claim on the merits because the Single Commissionerâ€™s order was improperly issued.Â  Therefore, the order of the circuit court is \r\nREVERSED.Â  \r\nGOOLSBY, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because we find the Single Commissionerâ€™s order was void ab initio, we need not address the circuit courtâ€™s finding that N.C. Guaranty was not authorized by section 38-31-160 of the South Carolina Code (2002) to apply to have the judgment set aside. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-591","title":"Chase Manhattan Bank v.

Watts, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-591\r\nSubmitted November 1, 2005 â€“ Filed November 21, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nA. Christopher Potts, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nJohn J. Hearn, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Renee C. Bailey appeals the trial courtâ€™s denial of her motion to set aside or otherwise grant her relief from a judgment of foreclosure.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn January 2001, Chase Manhattan Bank sued Bailey seeking to foreclose on her home in Summerville, South Carolina.Â  Bailey failed to answer the complaint, and Chase filed an affidavit of default and, in the latter part of April, was granted a default judgment of foreclosure and sale.Â  In May, Bailey filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition.Â  Further activity on the foreclosure action was suspended by the automatic stay imposed by the bankruptcy law.Â  \r\nAs a part of her restructuring plan in bankruptcy, Bailey was to continue making regular monthly mortgage payments directly to Chase and, in addition, a smaller payment to the bankruptcy court to apply to arrearages owed Chase.Â  After failing to make the requisite normal monthly payments, Bailey reached an agreement with Chase in December 2001, which was memorialized in a consent order.Â  The court-ordered agreement provided that the automatic stay would be reinstated as it applied to the home, and Bailey would be allowed to continue possession of the property on the condition that she pay Chase $6,246.80 in arrearages and continue making regular monthly mortgage payments.Â  The order further provided that upon failure by Bailey to comply with these conditions, Chase would be allowed to submit an affidavit to that effect, together with a proposed order, and the automatic stay would be terminated without further notice or hearing.Â  \r\nAccording to the record, Bailey paid the arrearages and made a monthly mortgage payment in January 2002.Â  Bailey submitted a payment to Chaseâ€™s loan servicer in February, but that payment was rejected.[2]Â  Bailey corresponded with the loan servicer explaining that the loan had been reinstated pursuant to the consent order.Â  Bailey then made a partial payment in March that was rejected, and a payment in April that was rejected due to non-sufficient funds.Â  Bailey continued to communicate intermittently with the loan servicer over the following months, but made no additional payments.Â  Chase filed an affidavit of default with the bankruptcy court.Â  Bailey did not contest the affidavit.[3]Â  \r\nBailey then filed a pleading captioned â€œSupplemental Answer and Counterclaimsâ€ with the circuit court in response to the original foreclosure action in an effort to prevent the public sale.Â  The trial court granted Chaseâ€™s motion to dismiss the Answer and Counterclaims.Â  In February 2004, nearly three years after the commencement of the initial foreclosure action, Bailey filed a motion to set aside the default or for other relief from judgment, relying on the procedure allowed by Rule 55(c), SCRCP and Rule 60, SCRCP.Â  (R. 9).Â  The trial court denied the motion.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA motion to vacate or set aside a default judgment is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Tri-County Ice &amp; Fuel Co. v. Palmetto Ice Co., 303 S.C. 237, 242, 399 S.E.2d 779, 782 (1990).Â  An abuse of discretion arises when the decision of the trial court is controlled by an error of law or where its order is based on factual conclusions that are without evidentiary support.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBailey claims the trial court erred in failing to set aside the judgment of foreclosure because events occurring after final judgment was rendered make enforcement of the judgment inequitable.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 60(b)(5), SCRCP, in pertinent part, includes the following provision:\r\n\r\n(b) Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly Discovered Evidence; Fraud, etc.Â  On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:\r\n(5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.\r\nThe motion shall be made within a reasonable time . . . .\r\n\r\nFirst, we are not convinced that Baileyâ€™s motion was filed within a reasonable time.Â  Chase correctly points out that the motion was filed almost three years after entry of the default judgment.Â  For much of that time the foreclosure action was stayed.Â  However, when the stay was lifted, instead of filing a motion to set aside default, Bailey filed what purported to be responsive pleadings as if no default existed.Â  No initial answer had ever been filed in the foreclosure action, making the filing of normal responsive pleadings inappropriate.Â  Then, six months later, the motion to set aside default was filed, alleging the same facts set forth in the supplemental answer and counterclaims.Â  During this period Bailey continued to have possession of the home.\r\nAssuming arguendo that Baileyâ€™s motion was not untimely, her arguments regarding Chaseâ€™s â€œinequitableâ€ conduct are unpersuasive.Â  When considering whether to grant relief from final judgments, â€œa court must balance the interest of finality against the need to provide a fair and just resolution of the dispute.â€Â  Chewning v. Ford Motor Co., 354 S.C. 72, 79-80, 579 S.E.2d 605, 609 (2003).Â  The supreme court in Chewning recognized the longstanding policy toward final judgments and that â€œimportant benefits are achieved by the preservation of final judgments.â€Â  Id. at 86, 579 S.E.2d at 613.Â  Consequently, the scale is generally tipped in favor of denying relief from a final judgment absent a compelling reason.Â  \r\nIn this case, there is no evidence Chase acted in a manner that would render enforcement of the judgment inequitable under Rule 60(b)(5).Â  It is undisputed that Bailey defaulted on her mortgage payments prior to the foreclosure action and that she did not make the payments to Chase under the bankruptcy courtâ€™s initial plan.Â  Bailey contends, however, that once the December 2001 payment agreement was made she â€œstrictly complied with the consent order.â€Â  That contention is not supported by the evidence.Â  The record shows that a March payment was made, but it was only a partial payment.Â  The record further shows that the April payment was rejected due to non-sufficient funds.Â  No further payments were remitted by Bailey.Â  \r\nAccording to affidavits of Baileyâ€™s husband and her attorney, a Chase representative, Bobby McGrath, advised Bailey in or about March or April that Bailey could â€œtack any returned or missed payments to the back end of the mortgage.â€Â  In August 2002, a mortgage company representative advised Bailey that she should pay all arrearages immediately or the foreclosure would proceed.Â  Bailey contends that the continuation of this action is inequitable in light of the representation that she could tack the missed payments on the back end of the loan.Â  However, Bailey neglects to consider that between the time of the conversation with McGrath and the communication in August, she still neglected to make any payments to Chase.\r\nFinally, it appears that Chaseâ€™s attorney proposed a conditional loan modification to Bailey a few days prior to a motion hearing in the case.Â  The proposal was open for acceptance until the morning of October&nbsp;14, 2003.Â  Baileyâ€™s attorney testified by affidavit that he left a message with Chaseâ€™s attorney accepting the offer on the morning of October 14.Â  However, there is nothing in the record to indicate Chase received notice of this last-minute acceptance.Â  Consequently, we cannot conclude it was inequitable for Chase to proceed with a motion hearing scheduled for the following day. \r\nBased on the evidence before us, we find no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court.Â  Accordingly, the ruling of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n STILWELL, KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n[2] Â Â Â Â Â Â  It appears Baileyâ€™s loan was assigned to a different loan servicing company during this period of time.Â  \r\n[3] Â Â Â Â Â Â  Baileyâ€™s bankruptcy action was subsequently dismissed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-593","title":"Cooper v.

Fowler, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Dick Smith Motors and its insurance carrier, S.C. Automobile Dealers Association (collectively â€œAppellantsâ€), appeal a circuit court order reversing a decision of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission which held that Lonnie Cooper did not aggravate a pre-existing back problem as a result of an admitted injury to his knee and therefore, that he reached maximum medical improvement for his injuries.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nLonnie Cooper sustained an admitted injury to his left knee on July 22, 2002 while working as a service technician/mechanic for Dick Smith Motors.Â  The injury occurred when Cooper slipped getting into a vehicle.Â  Cooper first received medical services for the injury at Doctorâ€™s Care, where he complained of ankle and knee pain.Â  He was referred to Dr. Bethea, who served as his treating physician.\r\nOn March 20, 2003, after approximately 17 visits to Dr. Bethea, and two knee surgeries, Dr. Bethea declared Cooper reached maximum medical improvement for his knee injuries.Â  At that time he stated that Cooper suffered a 25 percent permanent physical impairment of the injured extremity.Â  \r\nOn June 5, 2003, Appellants filed a Form 21 seeking to stop compensation for the knee injury and requesting credit for overpayment of temporary benefits.Â  Although Cooper was pro se at this point, he obtained the services of an attorney who filed a pre-hearing brief asserting that Cooper injured his knee and would be seeking all benefits applicable.Â  On July 18, 2003, the attorney also filed a Form 50 requesting further medical treatment for the knee injury and a finding of general disability.Â  \r\nA hearing on Appellantsâ€™ Form 21 was held before a single workersâ€™ compensation commissioner on July 31, 2003.Â  During the pre-trial conference Cooper sought to leave the record open in order to submit the deposition of Dr. Bethea to support his claim that he also injured his back in the accident.Â  The commissioner left the record open for 30 days and on August 28, 2003, the commissioner received Dr. Betheaâ€™s deposition and a report by Dr. Poletti.Â  Appellants objected to admission of Dr. Polettiâ€™s report and the commissioner sustained the objection, leaving the report in the commissionâ€™s file as a proffer, but not considering it in rendering a decision.\r\nDuring the hearing, Cooper testified that although the immediate problem after the accident was his left knee, he also began to experience numbness in his right leg and back pain.Â  Cooper stated that he mentioned the back problems several times to Dr. Bethea, but that the doctor repeatedly told him he needed to take care of one problem at a time.Â  He further testified that he did not receive any treatment for his back or right leg until he returned to Dr. Bethea using his health insurance.Â  \r\nOn cross-examination, opposing counsel confronted Cooper by bringing it to his attention that none of the records of Cooperâ€™s 17 visits to Dr. Bethea showed any mention of problems with his back or right leg.Â  Cooper responded that he told the doctor of the back pain after five or six visits and was aware that Dr. Bethea did not write anything in his reports concerning the back injury.Â  Also brought out on cross examination was the fact that Cooperâ€™s wife knew Dr. Bethea through her employment with a local hospital.Â  \r\nIn his deposition, Dr. Bethea testified to the injuries Cooper sustained to his knee and the course of treatment that was followed.Â  Dr. Bethea also testified that treatment was not rendered for Cooperâ€™s back problems until three months after the doctor declared Cooper reached maximum medical improvement for his knee injury.Â  He mentioned, however, that although he did not have any record of treatment for the back prior to that date, he thought Cooper did mention it in previous visits.Â  Dr. Bethea further testified that a twisting-type injury â€œcould be consistent with an aggravation . . . of pre-existing back problems,â€ although he could not say that with any degree of certainty.Â  \r\nOn November 26, 2003, the single commissioner issued an order finding inter alia, that Cooper reached maximum medical improvement for the admitted knee injury on March 20, 2003, the day he was released by Dr. Bethea.Â  The commissioner further found that â€œthe greater weight of evidence [did] not support a finding that [Cooper] sustained a compensable injury to the back as a result of the left knee injury on July 22, 2002.â€Â  Based on the evidence, the commissioner found Cooper was entitled to 78 weeks of compensation based on a 40 percent permanent partial disability to the injured leg minus credit for temporary total disability paid by Appellants since June 3, 2003.Â  \r\nCooper appealed this decision to the Full Commission and review took place on June 29, 2004.Â  The next day, the Full Commission issued an order affirming the commissionerâ€™s order in its entirety.Â  Â Â Cooper appealed the Full Commissionâ€™s decision to the circuit court and on September 30, 2004, the court issued an order reversing the Full Commission and remanding the matter back for a determination of the amount of benefits due Cooper.Â  \r\nSpecifically, the court held that â€œthe substantial evidence of the recordâ€ did not support the Full Commissionâ€™s decision.Â  The courtâ€™s decision was greatly influenced by the Dr. Bethea and Cooperâ€™s testimony that although the back injuries were not included in any written records, they were mentioned verbally while treatment for the knee was taking place.Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellantsâ€™ primary argument on appeal is that the circuit court erred in reversing the Full Commissionâ€™s finding that Cooper did not sustain an injury to his back as a result of the accident for which he received medical care.Â  Appellants argue this is especially true considering that the Commissionâ€™s decision was supported by substantial evidence.Â  We agree.\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act applies to appeals from decisions of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  In an appeal from the Commission, neither this Court nor the circuit court may substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 617, 571 S.E.2d 92, 95 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œAny review of the Commissionâ€™s factual findings is governed by the substantial evidence standard.â€Â  Lockridge v. Santens of Am., Inc., 344 S.C. 511, 515, 544 S.E.2d 842, 844 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Accordingly, we limit review to deciding whether the Commissionâ€™s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law.Â  Corbin, 351 S.C. at 617, 571 S.E.2d at 95.Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is evidence that, in viewing the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the same conclusion that the full commission reached.â€Â  Lockridge, 344 S.C. at 515, 544 S.E.2d at 844.Â  â€œThe â€˜possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agencyâ€™s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.â€™â€Â  Lee v. Harborside CafÃ©, 350 S.C. 74, 78, 564 S.E.2d 354, 356 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting Palmetto Alliance, Inc. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 282 S.C. 430, 432, 319 S.E.2d 695, 696 (1984)).\r\nSignificantly, â€œ[t]he Appellate Panel is the ultimate fact finder in Workersâ€™ Compensation cases and is not bound by the Single Commissionerâ€™s findings of fact.â€Â  Gibson v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. No. 3, 338 S.C. 510, 517, 526 S.E.2d 725, 729 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Accordingly, the appellate panel has the final determination of witness credibility and also determines the weight to be accorded evidence.Â  Id.Â \r\nIn the current case, after â€œcareful review,â€ the Commission found â€œthat [t]he findings of fact and conclusions of law as established by the hearing commissioner [were] correct.â€Â  (emphasis in original).Â  As such, the Commission adopted the hearing commissionerâ€™s findings of fact and rulings of law by reference into its final order as it is entitled to do under sections 42-17-40 and 1-23-350 of the South Carolina Code.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 42-17-40 (1976) &amp; 1-23-350 (1986); see also Eaddy v. Smurfit-Stone Container Corp., 355 S.C. 154, 167-168, 584 S.E.2d 390, 397-398 (Ct. App. 2003) (interpreting these statutory provisions and concluding the Commission meets the requirements contained therein when it incorporates a single commissionerâ€™s findings of fact and rulings of law by reference into its order).\r\nConsidering the current case with these standards in mind, we find the record contains substantial evidence to support the commissionâ€™s decision.Â  It is undisputed that none of the records stemming from Cooperâ€™s medical care prior to his release for the knee injury mention any purported back problems.Â  In fact, as the single commissioner noted in the first order, there was no mention of a back injury on Cooperâ€™s original Form 50, nor was there mention of the injury in Cooperâ€™s pre-hearing brief.Â  It was not until a pre-trial conference on the Form 21 â€œstop paymentâ€ hearing that the back injury was mentioned at all.Â  Despite this fact, the commissioner allowed the record to be kept open for Dr. Betheaâ€™s deposition.\r\nAs noted previously, Dr. Bethea testified that no treatment was provided for Cooperâ€™s back injuries until three months after Cooper reached maximum medical improvement for his knee injury.Â  He also stated, however, that although there was no written record of Cooper complaining of back pain, he thought he recalled it being mentioned.Â  Dr. Bethea further opined that the original accident could have aggravated a pre-existing back problem.\r\nTo the extent Dr. Betheaâ€™s testimony can be read to support Cooperâ€™s claim that he mentioned the back injury before treatment for his knee was completed, the commissioner was in a better position to determine his credibility.Â  When it comes to expert medical testimony, its admission is designed to provide assistance to the Commission in coming to a correct conclusion; as such, the Commission is left with discretion to determine the weight and credit to be given to the testimony.Â  Tiller v. Natâ€™l Health Care Ctr. of Sumter, 334 S.C. 333, 340, 513 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1999).Â  Although expert medical testimony is entitled to great respect, the Commission as fact finder may disregard the testimony if there is other competent evidence in the record.Â  Id.Â  Accordingly, once expert testimony is admitted, the Commission may consider it in the same manner as it would any other testimony.Â  Id.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAs there is evidence in the record to support the finding that Cooper did not sustain a compensable injury to his back as a result of the admitted accident, we reverse the circuit court and reinstate the Full Commissionâ€™s decision.Â  Because we reverse on Appellantâ€™s primary issue, we decline to address Appellantsâ€™ remaining issues.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling appellate court need not review remaining issues when disposition of prior issues are dispositive). \r\nREVERSED.

Lang, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this mortgage foreclosure action, Pendleton Partners, LLC, appeals a master in equityâ€™s decision denying its request to set aside an entry of default.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nCarolina First Bank (hereinafter â€œRespondentâ€) commenced this action by filing a complaint seeking foreclosure and appointment of a receiver against Ashley Tower, LP, Pendleton Partners, LLC, and James B. Miller.Â Â Â  \r\nOn December 21, 1998, James B. Miller and George T. Williams filed articles of organization with the Secretary of State creating Pendleton Partners, LLC.Â  Miller is listed as the initial agent for service of process.Â  According to the articles, the purpose of the limited liability company is the â€œownership, development and operation of real estate located at Pendleton and Pulaski Streetsâ€ in Columbia.Â  Williams and Miller are the sole members of the LLC and it is a member-managed limited liability company.Â  \r\nOn December 21, 2000, Ashley Tower, LP, executed a promissory note to Respondent in the principal amount of $350,000.[1]Â  To secure this note, Miller also mortgaged to Respondent all of the property owned at that time by Pendleton Partners, LLC.[2]Â  Â Subsequently, the mortgage went into default, and on August 23, 2002, Respondent filed its summons and complaint seeking foreclosure on the real property owned by Pendleton Partners, LLC.Â  \r\nAs all of the defendants failed to answer, Carolina First filed an affidavit of default on January 31, 2004.Â  The matter was referred the same day to the master in equity for Richland County.Â  On February 6, 2003, Pendleton Partners, LLC, (hereinafter â€œAppellantâ€) submitted a motion to set aside the default.Â  The motion was supported by an affidavit from Williams which, inter alia, alleged that Miller improperly mortgaged the property without Williamsâ€™ approval. \r\nAfter a hearing and upon review of the briefs submitted by both sides, the master-in-equity denied the motion by order dated September 25, 2003.Â  Appellant thereafter filed a notice of appeal to this Court, and on November 18, 2003, we issued a dismissal stating that an order refusing to grant relief from the entry of a default is not immediately appealable until after final judgment.Â  Upon receipt of this order, Appellant filed a petition for rehearing seeking a review of the dismissal.Â  On March 17, 2004, this court issued a second order affirming its determination that a default judgment is not immediately\r\nappealable.&nbsp; \r\nAppellant then filed a petition for certiorari to the supreme court seeking review of this courtâ€™s decision.Â  On November 16, 2004, at Appellantâ€™s request, the supreme court dismissed the action.Â  After this dismissal, a foreclosure hearing was scheduled before the master-in-equity on December 15, 2004.Â  On December 3, 2004, George T. Williams submitted a motion to intervene in the foreclosure action.Â  Williams asserted several problems existed with the mortgage including a lack of consideration to Appellant or Williams and failure by Respondent to â€œexercise due diligence to ascertain the legal status of the LLC before the mortgage was executed.â€Â  \r\nThe master entertained the motion to intervene along with the foreclosure action on December 15, 2004.Â  In two separate orders, the master denied the motion to intervene and granted the foreclosure sought by Carolina First.Â Â Â  \r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nAppellant now raises several alleged errors in the masterâ€™s rulings all relating to its failure to grant Appellantâ€™s motion to set aside the entry of default.\r\nAfter a review of the record, however, it is not clear that any of Appellantâ€™s current arguments were actually raised to and ruled upon by the master.Â  The masterâ€™s orders do not contain any discussion of the merits and merely deny Appellantâ€™s motions.Â  There are no transcripts in the record of any hearing before the master as to the various motions, nor did appellant make any motions pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP seeking to clarify the masterâ€™s orders.\r\nAccordingly, there is no way for this court to determine if the issues asserted on appeal have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.Â  As such, we find none of the issues are preserved for our review.Â Â Â  Â Â See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (finding an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appeal).\r\nAFFIRMED.

Madden, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this consolidated appeal, Kevin Powell (Husband) appeals the family court order awarding Linda Powell (Wife):Â  a divorce based on Husbandâ€™s adultery; $4,000 per month in alimony; health insurance maintained by Husband; a life insurance policy maintained by Husband as security for alimony; sixty-eight percent of the marital estate, net of liabilities; and attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  Husband also appeals the family courtâ€™s decision in a separate action to deny his request to modify his alimony obligation.Â  Finally, Husband appeals the courtâ€™s order finding him in contempt for failing to pay alimony.Â  We affirm in part, modify in part, reverse in part, vacate in part, and remand. \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were married in 1989.Â  At the time of the marriage, Husband had a college degree and was employed by American Express as a financial advisor.Â  Wife had a high school diploma and owned a court reporting business.Â  During the marriage, Wife was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent reconstructive surgery.Â  Wifeâ€™s reconstructive surgery led to complications necessitating several back surgeries.Â  Wife filed a claim under her long-term disability insurance and closed her court reporting business.Â Â  \r\nBetween 1996 and 1999, Husband and Wife separated several times due to marital difficulties.Â  Husband and Wife separated for the last time in December of 1999.Â  Just after the coupleâ€™s separation, Husband met another woman and began a romantic relationship with her.Â  On October 17, 2000, Wife filed for divorce on the grounds of Husbandâ€™s adultery and requested separate maintenance and support, equitable division of the marital property, an award of health insurance coverage, an order requiring Husband to secure a life insurance policy on his life naming Wife as the sole beneficiary, attorneyâ€™s fees and costs, and a restraining order preventing Husband from harassing Wife and restraining him from transferring or disposing of marital property.Â  Husband answered Wifeâ€™s complaint and asserted Wifeâ€™s alleged adultery as a counterclaim.Â Â  \r\nAfter a temporary hearing, the family court issued a pendente lite order:Â  (1) allowing Wife to remain in the marital home and giving exclusive use of the coupleâ€™s condominium to Husband; (2) giving Husband and Wife use of the vehicles driven by each; (3) ordering Husband to pay Wife $1,000 per month in temporary alimony, maintain Wifeâ€™s health insurance, and pay the mortgage on the marital residence in addition to all taxes and maintenance expenses; and (4) ordering Husband to transfer 400 shares of American Express stock to Wife in order for her to pay legal fees and living expenses.Â  The court also ordered Wife to pay any remaining expenses associated with the marital home.Â  \r\nThe family court conducted a trial over a period of three days in September and October of 2001.Â  In February 2002, the family court issued a final divorce decree granting Wife a divorce based on Husbandâ€™s adultery.Â  In its order, the family court awarded Wife $4,000 per month in alimony and apportioned the marital property, net of marital debts, sixty-eight percent to Wife and thirty-two percent to Husband.Â  Included in these assets, the family court awarded Wife the marital residence, the homeâ€™s furnishings, and her car.Â  In addition, the family court ordered Husband to maintain Wifeâ€™s medical insurance, maintain a life insurance policy naming Wife as an irrevocable beneficiary to secure his alimony obligation, pay $30,000 of Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees, and pay $9,000 for Wifeâ€™s expert witness.Â Â Â  \r\nHusband filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion to alter or amend the family courtâ€™s order, which the family court denied.Â  Husband appealed both the divorce decree and the order denying his Rule 59(e) motion.Â  During the pendency of Husbandâ€™s appeal, Husband filed an action with the family court seeking to modify his alimony obligation based on a change in circumstances.Â  Wife filed a motion to dismiss Husbandâ€™s petition due to the pending appeal.Â  The family court continued Husbandâ€™s action pending the outcome of his appeal.Â  In the meantime, Wife filed a petition for a rule to show cause, requesting Husband be held in contempt of court for failing to pay her alimony as specified in the divorce decree.Â  Husband then filed a motion seeking to stay Wifeâ€™s action pending the outcome of Husbandâ€™s petition for modification of the alimony award.Â  The family court held Husband in contempt of court.Â  This court, however, issued an order staying the contempt proceeding and remanding the issue of modification back to the family court.Â  The family court issued an order denying Husbandâ€™s request for modification of his alimony obligation.Â  In this consolidated appeal, Husband appeals the divorce decree, the order denying his Rule 59(e) motion, and the order denying his request to modify his alimony obligation and finding him in contempt.Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhen reviewing the factual finding of the family court, this court may take its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â \r\nDurlach v. Durlach, 359 S.C. 64, 70, 596 S.E.2d 908, 912 (2004).Â  However, because the family court is in a superior position to judge the witnessesâ€™ demeanor and veracity, its findings should be given broad discretion.Â \r\nScott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003).Â  Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Grounds for Divorce \r\nHusband argues the family court erred in granting Wifeâ€™s request for a divorce on the basis of Husbandâ€™s adultery.Â  Although Husband admits he began a romantic relationship with another woman shortly after he separated from Wife, he asserts Wife also committed adultery during the marriage.Â  Husband argues Wifeâ€™s admission during her deposition and at trial that she committed adultery is sufficient evidence to assert the defense of recrimination.Â  We agree. \r\nâ€œAs a general rule, to constitute the defense of recrimination, the misconduct of which the plaintiff is guilty must be such as to provide the defendant with grounds for divorce.â€Â \r\nAllen v. Allen, 287 S.C. 501, 504, 339 S.E.2d 872, 874 (Ct. App. 1986).Â Â  \r\n\r\nTo obtain a divorce on the ground of adultery, the evidence establishing the adultery â€œmust be clear and positive, and the infidelity must be established by a clear preponderance of the evidence.Â  The proof must be sufficiently definite to identify the time and place of the offense, and the circumstances under which it was committed.â€Â  \r\n\r\nNemeth v. Nemeth, 325 S.C. 480, 484, 481 S.E.2d 181, 183 (Ct. App. 1997) (quoting Brown v. Brown, 215 S.C. 502, 512-13, 56 S.E.2d 330, 335 (1949)).\r\nIn response to Wifeâ€™s allegations of adultery in her complaint, Husband counterclaimed that Wife committed adultery with Ray Wright.Â  Later, Wife admitted in her deposition that she had an affair with Wright during the marriage.Â  At the final hearing, Wife testified in more detail regarding the relationship.Â  She stated that during one period of separation, both she and Husband were confronted by Ray Wrightâ€™s wife regarding an affair.Â  Wife testified that at that point, no affair had occurred and she informed Mrs. Wright of that fact.Â  Prior to moving back into the marital home, Husband informed Wife that Mrs. Wright had been calling him at work and told Wife to â€œtake care of it.â€Â  Wife stated that her affair with Wright occurred later.Â  She testified that Husband never asked her about the affair with Wright, but that he â€œknewâ€ it had occurred and would bring it up during arguments:Â  \r\n\r\n[Wife]: He would just make a statement, well you had an affair with Ray Wright.Â  Heâ€™s never asked me.Â  He knew I did.Â  He just said take care of it.Â  He never asked me.\r\n[Husbandâ€™s attorney]:Â  Your husband never asked you? \r\n[Wife]:Â  Never asked me. \r\n[Husbandâ€™s attorney]:Â  And you never told him?\r\n[Wife]:Â  He never asked me.Â  He said take care of it, and I took care of it. \r\n\r\nHusband alleged in his affidavit for the temporary hearing and in his deposition that Wife had an affair.Â  However, he testified at the final hearing that although he suspected an affair had occurred between Wife and Wright, Wife denied it and he had no proof.Â  He admitted to revisiting the subject whenever the couple would have arguments, but he stated that Wife continued to deny the affair.Â  Husband testified that he did not know for sure that Wife had an affair until she admitted it in her deposition testimony.Â  According to Husband, if he had known about the affair during the marriage, he would have left Wife and filed for divorce immediately.Â Â  \r\nThe family court found that although Wife proved her allegation of Husbandâ€™s adultery, Husband did not provide corroborative evidence of Wifeâ€™s adultery.Â  The court further found that Husband forgave and condoned Wifeâ€™s adultery when he returned to the marriage.Â  Based on these facts, the court found Wife was entitled to a divorce based upon the fault grounds of adultery; Husband condoned Wifeâ€™s admitted adultery; and the defense of recrimination was not available to Husband because he failed to corroborate Wifeâ€™s adultery.Â Â Â  \r\nInitially, we address the courtâ€™s finding that Husband failed to corroborate Wifeâ€™s adultery.Â  Although corroborative evidence is generally required in order to prove a ground for divorce, this rule may sometimes be relaxed.Â  See \r\nBrown v. Brown,  215 S.C. 502, 512, 56 S.E.2d 330, 335 (1949) (holding that corroborative evidence, in addition to a partyâ€™s or the partiesâ€™ testimony, is necessary to grant a divorce);\r\nHarvley v. Harvley,  279 S.C. 572, 574, 310 S.E.2d 161, 162 (Ct. App. 1983) (noting that â€œ[t]he main reason for the rule requiring corroboration is to prevent collusion.Â  Where it is evident that collusion does not exist, this rule may be relaxed.â€).Â  In fact, we have upheld a family courtâ€™s decision to grant a divorce based on adultery when a husband admitted his adultery on several occasions, finding:Â  â€œThere is no need to corroborate the uncontradicted admission of appellant against his own interests.â€Â \r\nHarvley, 279 S.C. at 574, 310 S.E.2d at 162.Â  In the present case, Wifeâ€™s admission of the affair was clear evidence of her adulterous relationship with Wright.Â  Because we find the case at bar to be highly contested and because Wife admitted her adultery on more than one occasion, we find corroborating evidence of her adultery unnecessary.Â  \r\nWe now turn to whether Husband condoned Wifeâ€™s adultery such that it was no longer a ground for a divorce.Â  In\r\nWilson v. Wilson,  274 S.C. 236, 262 S.E.2d 732 (1980), the supreme court stated: \r\n\r\nCondonation has been defined as forgiveness, either express or implied, of an antecedent matrimonial offense by one spouse for a breach of marital duty by the other on condition that it shall not be repeated, and that the offender shall thereafter treat the forgiving party with conjugal kindness.Â  It is primarily a state of mind, the existence of which may appear either from the language used, from conduct, or both.\r\n\r\nWilson, 274 S.C. at 238, 262 S.E.2d at 733.Â  To establish the defense of condonation, the offending spouse must prove â€œthe spouse offended against (1) had knowledge of the offense or misconduct allegedly condoned, and (2) voluntarily forgave it or voluntarily engaged in the conduct which is asserted to amount to implied forgiveness.â€Â \r\nMcLaughlin v. McLaughlin, 244 S.C. 265, 274, 136 S.E.2d 537, 541 (1964) (citations omitted).Â  â€œThe forgiveness may be either express or implied.Â  A full resumption or continuance of marital cohabitation after the conduct complained of and with knowledge thereof, for any considerable period of time, quite conclusively shows an intention to forgive or condone such conduct.â€Â  Id.Â  (emphasis added).Â  \r\nAlthough Wife contends Husband condoned her adultery, we find her own testimony indicates Husband did not have full knowledge of her affair, and therefore, Husband did not have the ability to condone her behavior.Â  Wife testified that she and Husband were both confronted by Mrs. Wright before the affair occurred.Â  The fact that Husband alleged the affair in his responsive pleadings, in his affidavit, and at his deposition did not amount to proof that he had full knowledge of the affair while maintaining the marital relationship.Â  Husband testified that his suspicions regarding the affair were never confirmed until Wife admitted to it in her deposition.Â  There was no evidence in the record that Husband stayed in the marital relationship with full knowledge of the affair; thus, the family court erred in finding Husband had condoned Wifeâ€™s adultery.\r\nBecause the record contains sufficient evidence of Wifeâ€™s adultery and the court erred in finding condonation, we find Husband successfully established recrimination as a defense to Wifeâ€™s request for a divorce based on adultery.Â  Thus, the grant of a divorce based upon this ground is reversed.Â  \r\nHowever, the parties moved at the final hearing to amend their pleadings to include the ground of one yearâ€™s separation.Â  Because the parties lived separate and apart for more than one year prior to the final hearing, we find that a divorce based on that ground appropriate.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-10(5) (1976) (allowing a divorce â€œ[o]n the application of either party if and when the husband and wife have lived separate and apart without cohabitation for a period of one year.â€).Â  Accordingly, the family courtâ€™s order is modified to grant the parties a divorce based upon one yearâ€™s separation.\r\nII. Alimony\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in awarding Wife alimony.Â  Specifically, he argues: (1) Wife should have been barred from receiving alimony due to her adultery; (2) Wifeâ€™s conduct contributed significantly to the break-up of the marriage; (3) Wife received substantial income from her disability insurance in addition to her ability to earn income from other employment; and (4) Husband did not have the ability to pay Wife alimony due to the substantial decline in his income from prior years.Â  Husband also contends even if the family court did not err in awarding Wife alimony, it erred in awarding her $4,000 per month in alimony, in awarding her alimony in the form of medical insurance, and in ordering him to maintain life insurance to secure Wifeâ€™s alimony award.Â  We agree.\r\nA family court may award temporary or permanent spousal support in the form of alimony.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(B) (Supp. 2004).Â  There are several factors the family court must consider in making an alimony award.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2004) (listing thirteen factors for the court to consider and weigh as it deems appropriate).Â  Alimony may not be awarded to a spouse who commits adultery â€œbefore . . . (1) the formal signing of a written property or marital settlement agreement or (2) entry of a permanent order of separate maintenance and support or of a permanent order approving a property or marital settlement agreement between the parties.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(A) (Supp. 2004).Â  However, an adulterous spouse will not be barred from receiving alimony when the accusing spouse condoned the adultery.Â \r\nGrubbs v. Grubbs, 272 S.C. 138, 140-41, 249 S.E.2d 747, 748-49 (1978); Doe v. Doe, \r\n286 S.C. 507, 512, 334 S.E.2d 829, 832 (Ct. App. 1985).\r\nWife admitted she committed adultery during the marriage.Â  Although alimony will not be barred for a spouse whose adultery is condoned, as determined above, we find Wife did not prove Husbandâ€™s condonation of her adultery.Â  Thus, we find Wife is barred from receiving alimony. Â In addition, because medical insurance coverage is awarded as a form of alimony, we also find the family court erred in ordering Husband to maintain Wifeâ€™s medical insurance.Â  See \r\nSharpe v. Sharpe, 307 S.C. 540, 542-43, 416 S.E.2d 215, 216-17 (Ct. App. 1992) (treating courtâ€™s order requiring a husband to pay his wifeâ€™s medical insurance as a form of alimony).Â  Finally, because the court ordered Husband to maintain life insurance to secure Wifeâ€™s alimony award, we now find this requirement unnecessary.Â  \r\nThus, we reverse the family courtâ€™s award of alimony, order requiring Husband maintain Wifeâ€™s health insurance coverage, and order requiring Husband to maintain life insurance to secure the alimony.Â  \r\nIII. Valuation of Marital Assets \r\nHusband argues the family court erred in its valuation of certain marital assets.Â  Specifically, Husband asserts the family court failed to take into account significant depreciation in certain marital assets between the commencement of the marital litigation and the trial.Â  \r\nSection 20-7-473 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004) defines marital property as: â€œall real and personal property which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation as provided in Â§ 20-7-472 regardless of how legal title is held,â€ noting certain exceptions.Â  Thus, marital property subject to equitable division is valued at the time of the commencement of the marital litigation.Â \r\nFields v. Fields, 342 S.C. 182, 186, 536 S.E.2d 684, 686 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œHowever, it is equally well settled that the parties to domestic litigation are entitled to share in any appreciation or depreciation in marital assets occurring after separation but before divorce.â€Â \r\nHatfield v. Van Epps, 358 S.C. 185, 194, 594 S.E.2d 526, 531 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Checking Account \r\nHusband argues the family court erred in its valuation of Husbandâ€™s Regionâ€™s Bank checking account.Â  He contends although the family courtâ€™s valuation reflects the value at the date the marital litigation was filed, $43,357, it failed to account for a $25,000 check to the Internal Revenue Service, a $10,000 check to the State of Georgia for estimated taxes, and a $9,788 payment to American Express for debt incurred on Husbandâ€™s corporate credit card.Â  Husband asserts these checks were in transit at the commencement of the marital litigation and, therefore, were not reflected in the balance indicated on the bank statement provided to the court.\r\nThe family court noted in its table of marital assets and liabilities that the balance in the Regions Bank checking account did not include these in transit checks.Â  The court noted that the two checks for the taxes and the check for the American Express bill were included in the partiesâ€™ marital debts with â€œcredit given to Husband for paying these obligations in apportionment.â€Â Â Â  \r\nWe agree with the family courtâ€™s determination that although the checking account balance at the time of filing does not reflect these in transit checks, the debts to which these checks relate are properly included in its valuation of the marital debts.Â  Thus, we find no error with the family courtâ€™s valuation of Husbandâ€™s Regions Bank checking account. \r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rollover IRA \r\nHusband asserts the family court erred in its valuation of his American Express IRA rollover account.Â  Husband maintains his statement dated October 27, 2000, more accurately reflects the value of this account on the date of filing.Â  \r\nDuring the trial, Wifeâ€™s expert, a CPA, testified she only received statements dated May 26, 2000, reflecting a balance of $19,830.05 and dated October 27, 2000, reflecting a balance of $3,189.93.Â  She stated she used the May 2000 balance because she could not substantiate the decrease in the values between these two dates.Â  Wifeâ€™s attorney then introduced the May 2000 statement into evidence without objection by Husband.Â  The family courtâ€™s order reflects its adoption of the CPAâ€™s valuation at $19,830.05.Â  The court noted the value on October 27, 2000 was $3,189.93, but it could not substantiate the decrease in this account.Â  \r\nHusband did not introduce any evidence of the $3,189.93 balance during the trial other than his own testimony.Â  However, Wife did not object when he introduced a statement dated September 29, 2000, reflecting a balance of $12,353.11.Â  Because marital property is valued as of the time of the commencement of the marital litigation, we find the September 29, 2000 statement, which is dated just a few weeks prior to the October 17, 2000 filing of this matter, better reflects the value for purposes of valuation of the coupleâ€™s marital property.Â  Thus, we reverse the family courtâ€™s valuation of this asset and modify it to reflect the $12,353.11 value. \r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Scientific Ag Industries Stock \r\nHusband asserts the family court erred in its valuation of his Scientific Ag Industries stock.Â  He contends this asset had no value at the time the marital litigation commenced.Â  We disagree. \r\nWifeâ€™s CPA stated she valued this asset at $25,200 based on its purchase price in September 1999.Â  She testified she used the purchase price to value the asset because it was the only evidence of the value she was provided.Â  Husband did not provide any evidence, other than his own testimony, indicating the stock was worthless.Â  In addition, Husband introduced a 2000 K-1 statement indicating his capital account contained a $25,200 balance.Â  Based on the evidence in the record, the family court did not err in valuing his investment in Scientific Ag Industries.Â  \r\nD.&nbsp;&nbsp; American Express Stock \r\nHusband argues the family court erred in its valuation of his American Express stock.Â  He asserts the family court should have valued his holdings as of the date of the trial, reflecting the decrease in the market value between the commencement of the marital litigation and the trial.Â  We disagree. \r\nOn November 13, 2000, the family court held a hearing on Wifeâ€™s motion for temporary relief and discovery.Â  After the hearing, the family court issued an order that, among other things, awarded Wife 400 shares of Husbandâ€™s American Express stock.Â  Wife introduced a statement reflecting Husband held approximately 1,197 shares of American Express stock with a market value of $66,913.32 as of November 13, 2000.Â  Because the division of this asset occurred at the time of the pendente lite order, we find the family courtâ€™s valuation of the asset as of that date appropriate and find no error in the courtâ€™s valuation of $66,913.32.Â  \r\nWhile the family courtâ€™s overall valuation of the stock was appropriate, we note that in dividing the property between Husband and Wife, the family court appears to have listed the value of the stock at the time Wife sold the shares awarded to her after the pendente lite order.Â  These numbers should be corrected to reflect the value of the stock at the time the shares were awarded.Â  Thus, we find the correct apportioned values to be $22,350, rather than $18,890, to Wife and $44,563, rather than $37,565, to Husband. \r\nE.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other Personal Property\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in valuing his interest in a timeshare located in Kentucky, a deck boat, Wifeâ€™s Mustang, and his Jeep.Â  We disagree. \r\nHusband solely points to his own testimony to assert the family court erred in valuing these assets.Â  In our review of the record, we conclude the family court adopted the valuations asserted by Wife in her financial declaration.Â  Thus, it appears the family court based its determination on the credibility of the witnesses.Â  Because we give great deference to the family court, which heard and saw the witnesses, to determine the credibility of the witness, we find no error in its valuation of these items.Â  See \r\nScott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003) (holding â€œwhere there is disputed evidence, the appellate court may adhere to the findings of the family court.Â  Because the family court is in a superior position to judge the witnessesâ€™ demeanor and veracity, its findings should be given broad discretion.â€)(citations omitted). \r\nF. 2001 Income Tax Liability\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in failing to consider the 2001 income tax liability in apportioning the marital property.Â  We disagree. \r\nIn apportioning marital property, the family court must consider â€œliens and any other encumbrances upon the marital property, which themselves must be equitably divided, or upon the separate property of either of the parties, and any other existing debts incurred by the parties or either of them during the course of the marriage.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472(13) (Supp. 2004).Â  â€œThis statute creates a rebuttable presumption that a debt of either spouse incurred prior to the beginning of marital litigation is a marital debt and must be factored in the totality of equitable apportionment.â€Â  Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 546, 615 S.E.2d 98, 105 (2005).\r\n\r\nWhen a debt is incurred after the commencement of litigation but before the final divorce decree, the family court may equitably apportion it as a marital debt when it is shown the debt was incurred for marital purposes, i.e., for the joint benefit of both parties during the marriage.Â  When a debt is incurred after marital litigation begins, the burden of proving the debt is marital rests upon the party who makes such an assertion.\r\n\r\nId. at 547, 615 S.E.2d at 105 (citations omitted).Â  \r\nWife filed for divorce in October 2000, thus the 2001 income tax liability was incurred after the commencement of the marital litigation.Â  Husband provided no evidence indicating he and Wife incurred the 2001 income tax liability for their joint benefit.Â  In addition, Husband provided no evidence of the income tax liability or the amount.Â  He solely pointed to Wifeâ€™s CPAâ€™s acknowledgment that the 2001 income tax liability existed and that she was not aware of any payments toward that liability.Â  Thus, we find no evidence in the record to support Husbandâ€™s contentions and find no error by the family court in failing to consider the alleged 2001 tax liability. \r\nTo summarize our findings regarding valuation of marital assets, we reverse the family courtâ€™s valuation of Husbandâ€™s Rollover IRA and find $12,353.11 to be the correct value of this marital asset.Â  In addition, we modify the family courtâ€™s apportioned values for American Express stock, finding the portion received by Wife to be valued at $44,563 and the portion received by Husband to be valued at $22,350.Â  We affirm the family courtâ€™s valuations of all other assets disputed by Husband. \r\nIV. Equitable Apportionment\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in apportioning the marital property.Â  He asserts the family courtâ€™s distribution was in error because:Â  (1) the family court erred in its valuation of the marital assets;Â  (2) his adultery did not contribute to the break-up of the marriage or affect the economic circumstances of the marriage; (3) it failed to take into account the contributions of the parties during the marriage; and (4) the award of the marital home constituted an abuse of discretion because the parties had no children and the home was the most substantial asset owned by the parties. We disagree. \r\nSection 20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004) requires the family court to consider fifteen factors in apportioning marital property, but the court is allowed to weigh those factors as it deems appropriate.Â  In reviewing the family courtâ€™s equitable apportionment, an appellate courtâ€™s role is to examine the fairness of the apportionment as a whole.Â \r\nBragg v. Bragg, 347 S.C. 16, 24, 553 S.E.2d 251, 255 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The family courtâ€™s apportionment will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Id. at 23, 553 S.E.2d at 255.Â  â€œThis court will affirm the family court judge if it can be determined that the judge addressed the factors under section 20-7-472 sufficiently for us to conclude he was cognizant of the statutory factors.â€Â  Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 100, 545 S.E.2d 531, 537 (Ct. App. 2001). \r\nWe find the family court addressed all of the appropriate factors in its order and did not abuse its discretion.Â  At the time of the trial, Husband was 43, Wife was 53, and the parties had been married for twelve years.Â  Wife is a breast cancer survivor who underwent reconstructive surgery as a result of her cancer.Â  She suffered from complications due to her reconstructive surgery requiring her to endure numerous surgeries on her back.Â  At the time of the trial, Wife continued to suffer from back pain, hip problems, arthritis, and asthma.Â  In 1996, Wifeâ€™s physician declared her disabled, she discontinued her work as a court reporter, and she began receiving disability benefits from her disability insurance policy.Â  Since then, Wife asserts her disability prohibits her from earning an income outside of the disability benefits, which at the time of the trial amounted to $2,059 per month.Â  Without the ability to earn an income, Wife is unlikely to have the ability to acquire assets in the future.Â  \r\nHusband, on the other hand, also underwent back surgery, but it does not appear to have affected his ability to work.Â  Wifeâ€™s CPA testified Husbandâ€™s net income for 1999 and 2000 was $255,052 and $277,926, respectively.Â  Husband testified due to changes in his employerâ€™s compensation system and increase in his business expenses, his income was expected to decrease significantly.Â  Wifeâ€™s CPA determined Husbandâ€™s expected net income for 2001 would be $121,459 taking into account these changes.Â  The record indicates Husband provided a greater amount in the way of direct contributions to the marriage since Wifeâ€™s disability in 1996.Â  But, until Wifeâ€™s disability, Wife owned and operated her own business and made significant direct contributions.Â  After her disability, the record indicates she continued to provide direct contributions to the marriage through her disability benefits.Â  Neither party participates in an employer sponsored retirement plan.Â  However, Husband is eligible for a deferred compensation plan, which the family court valued at $39,940.Â  In addition, Husband has IRAs and other retirement investments valued at approximately $44,730, while Wife has an IRA valued at $455.Â  The family court considered the marital debt valued at approximately $453,000 and apportioned it forty-nine percent to Wife and fifty-one percent to Husband, taking into account the debt associated with the assets assigned to each.Â Â  \r\nAlthough the family court erroneously determined Husband condoned Wifeâ€™s adultery in granting Wifeâ€™s request for a divorce based on Husbandâ€™s adultery, it specifically stated it made its decision regarding apportionment of the marital property absent of Husbandâ€™s adultery.Â  The family court granted Wifeâ€™s request for alimony and ordered Husband to pay $4,000 per month in addition to providing Wife with health insurance coverage.Â  As explained, we reverse the family courtâ€™s award of alimony and thus, we also consider this fact in apportioning the marital property.Â  \r\nThe parties did not have significant nonmarital property or prior support obligations.Â  No children were produced from the marriage, and therefore, custody was not an issue.Â  Finally, the parties did not identify any significant tax consequences arising out of the equitable apportionment.Â  \r\nBased on the record before us, especially considering Wifeâ€™s health problems and inability to earn income in the future, the family court did not abuse its discretion in apportioning the marital property.Â  Given the adjustments to the valuation of Husbandâ€™s Rollover IRA and the American Express Stock, we find the court apportionment of sixty-eight percent of the marital estate to Wife and thirty-two percent of the marital estate to Husband to be fair under the circumstances.Â  \r\nAs for Husbandâ€™s contentions regarding the marital home, we find them without merit.Â  Initially, we note Husbandâ€™s argument that the family courtâ€™s decision was in error because no children were produced from the marriage harkens to an award of the marital home for a specified period of time as an incident of support.Â  However, the family court did not award the marital home as an incident of support, but rather awarded the equity in the marital home as part of its equitable apportionment of the marital property.Â  \r\nA family court may require the sale of marital property and a division of the proceeds in order to equitably divide the marital estate.Â  â€œHowever, the court should first try to make an â€˜in-kindâ€™ distribution of the marital assets, i.e., award a share of each type of asset to each spouse.â€Â \r\nWooten, 364 S.C. 532, 542, 615 S.E.2d 98, 103 (citations omitted).Â  Nevertheless, a family court â€œmay grant a spouse title to the marital home as part of the equitable distribution because it is not feasible to make an in-kind distribution of the home.â€Â  Id.Â  The Wooten court went on to distinguish an award of the marital home as an incident-of-support from an award of the marital home as part of the equitable distribution:\r\n\r\nThe incident-of-support cases are largely irrelevant in deciding whether the marital home should be awarded to one spouse in the equitable division of marital property.Â  A decision on whether to award the marital home to one spouse for a defined period as an incident of support and a decision on whether to award the home permanently to one spouse in equitable distribution require different analyses.Â  While it is proper for the family court to consider support-related facts in both settings, the lack of a support-related rationale should not necessarily prevent or reduce the likelihood of an award of the marital home to one spouse in equitable distribution.\r\nInstead, as we have done in deciding these appeals, the family court should focus on a fair distribution of the entire marital estate.\r\n\r\nWooten at 543-44, 615 S.E.2d at 103-04.Â  Thus, regardless of whether the couple had children, we find no abuse of discretion in the family courtâ€™s overall apportionment of the marital property.Â  \r\nV.Â  Contempt\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in finding him in contempt of court for failing to comply with its order to pay alimony.Â  He asserts he did not have the ability to pay Wife alimony; thus, his noncompliance was not willful.Â Â  \r\nThe family court has exclusive jurisdiction: â€œIn all cases or proceedings within the county against persons charged with failure to obey an order of the court made pursuant to authority conferred by law.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(13) (1976).Â  Thus, the family court had jurisdiction to hold Husband in contempt for failure to comply with his alimony obligation.Â  \r\nAn appellate court may reverse a trial courtâ€™s decision regarding contempt only if it is without evidentiary support or it finds the trial court abused its discretion.Â \r\nDurlach v. Durlach, 359 S.C. 64, 70, 596 S.E.2d 908, 912 (2004).Â  â€œWillful disobedience of a court order may result in contempt.Â  A willful act is one done voluntarily and intentionally, with the specific intent of doing something the law forbids.â€Â  Id. at 71, 596 S.E.2d at 912 (citations omitted).Â  â€œBefore a court finds a person in contempt, the record must clearly and specifically reflect the contemptuous conduct.â€Â \r\nBrasington v. Shannon, 288 S.C. 183, 184, 341 S.E.2d 130, 131 (1986).Â  â€œIn a proceeding for contempt for violation of a court order, the moving party must show the existence of the order and the facts establishing the respondentâ€™s noncompliance.Â  The burden then shifts to the respondent to establish his defense and inability to comply with the order.â€Â  Id. (citations omitted).Â  Failure by an obligated spouse to make alimony payments required by court order constitutes a prima facie case for contempt.Â \r\nDunson v. Dunson, 278 S.C. 210, 213, 294 S.E.2d 39, 40 (1982). Â \r\nAt the contempt hearing, Husband acknowledged his awareness of the court order requiring him to pay Wife alimony.Â  In addition he admitted he had not paid alimony in over three months.Â  He simply maintained he did not have the funds to pay it.Â  However, Husband admitted he received approximately $20,000 to $25,000 during that same period of time.Â  In addition, he admitted taking several trips during the period he stopped paying alimony, including trips to Hawaii and California.Â  Thus, based on the evidence in the record, we find Husband failed to establish a defense of his inability to comply with the family courtâ€™s order, and the family court did not abuse its discretion in finding Husband in contempt. \r\nAlthough we find the family court did not abuse its discretion in holding Husband in contempt, we must vacate its order.Â  â€œGenerally, reversal of a judgment on appeal has the effect of vacating the judgment and leaving the case standing as if no such judgment had been rendered.Â  Consequently, a party who receives payment under a judgment subsequently reversed must restore whatever advantage he obtained thereby to his adversary.â€Â \r\nBrown v. Brown, 286 S.C. 56, 57, 331 S.E.2d 793, 793-94 (Ct. App. 1985) (citations omitted).Â  Therefore, given our decision to reverse the family courtâ€™s award of alimony under the divorce decree, Wife would not be entitled to receive the alimony Husband failed to pay under the contempt order.Â  Accordingly, we vacate the family courtâ€™s order finding Husband in contempt.\r\nVI. Attorneyâ€™s Fees and Costs \r\nHusband argues the family court erred in requiring him to pay $30,000 of Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees and costs, in addition to $9,000 for Wifeâ€™s expert witness. Â Primarily, he asserts the discovery difficulties alluded to by the court did not exist.Â  In addition, Husband contends Wife incurred a majority of her attorneyâ€™s fees in preparation for trial after discovery and his failure to produce information relating to the Scientific Ag Industries stock was inadvertent.Â  \r\nThe family court has statutory authority to award attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(38) (Supp. 2004).Â  â€œAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge and should not be disturbed on appeal unless there is an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 533, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004).Â  In determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the court should consider each partyâ€™s ability to pay, whether beneficial results were obtained by the attorney, the financial conditions of the parties, and the effect of the attorneyâ€™s fees on each party.Â  Griffith v. Griffith, 332 S.C. 630, 645, 506 S.E.2d 526, 534 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  In determining what amount of attorneyâ€™s fees should be awarded, the court should consider â€œthe nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered; the time necessarily devoted to the case; the professional standing of counsel; the contingency of compensation; the beneficial results obtained; and the customary legal fees for similar services.â€Â  Id. at 645-46, 506 S.E.2d at 534.\r\nThe record indicates Wife incurred $28,972.99 in attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  These fees did not include Wifeâ€™s CPAâ€™s expert fee of $10,249.60 or the balance due to Wifeâ€™s appraiser of $350.Â  The family court ordered Husband to pay $30,000 to Wife in attorneyâ€™s fees and costs in addition to $9,000 towards Wifeâ€™s CPAâ€™s fees and $350 towards Wifeâ€™s appraiserâ€™s fees.Â Â  \r\nIn light of our decision to reverse the family courtâ€™s award of alimony to Wife, we find it appropriate to reconsider the family courtâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs to Wife.Â  See \r\nRogers v. Rogers, 343 S.C. 329, 334, 540 S.E.2d 840, 842 (2001) (â€œ[S]ince the beneficial result obtained by counsel is a factor in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees, when that result is reversed on appeal, the attorneyâ€™s fee award must also be reconsidered.â€).Â  Accordingly, we remand the matter to family court to reconsider the Wifeâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  Further, in light of our decision that alimony was inappropriate in this case, the family court should also consider on remand whether the alimony payments Husband made to Wife should be set-off against any award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  See Brown, 286 S.C. at 57, 331 S.E.2d at 793-94 (â€œ[A] party who receives payment under a judgment subsequently reversed must restore whatever advantage he obtained thereby to his adversary.â€).\r\nVII.Â  Request of Modification \r\nFinally, Husband argues the family court erred in initially failing to assert jurisdiction over his request for modification of his alimony obligation and in denying his request to modify his alimony obligation.Â  Given our decision to reverse the family courtâ€™s decision to award Wife alimony we need not address these arguments.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe family court erred in awarding Wife a divorce based on Husbandâ€™s adultery because Husband sufficiently established a defense of recrimination due to Wifeâ€™s adultery.Â  Thus, we reverse the family courtâ€™s decision to grant Wifeâ€™s divorce based on this ground.Â  However, we find the parties were entitled to a divorce based on one year of continuous separation.Â  Because we find Wife committed adultery, she is barred from receiving alimony.Â  Therefore, we reverse the family courtâ€™s award of alimony to Wife.Â  The family courtâ€™s valuation of Husbandâ€™s Rollover IRA was in error.Â  We find the correct value of this asset to be $12,353.11.Â  We find no error in the family courtâ€™s valuation of the other disputed marital assets, but we correct its allocation of the American Express stock in accordance with its valuation.Â  The family court did not abuse its discretion in apportioning the marital property.Â  In light of our determinations, we remand this matter to the family court to reconsider the award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife and the appropriateness of a set-off of alimony paid.Â  Finally, based on our reversal of the family courtâ€™s award of alimony to Wife, we need not address Husbandâ€™s arguments concerning modification of Wifeâ€™s alimony award and we vacate the family courtâ€™s order finding Husband in contempt.Â  Accordingly, the family courtâ€™s orders are \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, MODIFIED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, and REMANDED IN PART.Â  \r\nGOOLSBY, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-596","title":"Williams v.

Williams, IV was arrested for driving under the influence.Â  Williams failed to consent to a breath test offered by the arresting law enforcement officer.Â  As a result, the South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles (the Department) suspended Williamsâ€™ driverâ€™s license.Â  Williams challenged the suspension.Â  An administrative hearing was held, and the hearing officer affirmed the suspension.Â  The circuit court reversed. The Department appeals the circuit courtâ€™s decision.Â  We reverse.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 14, 2003, South Carolina Highway Patrol Trooper S. S. McKenzie arrested Williams in Sumter County for driving under the influence.Â  Trooper McKenzie transported Williams to a breath test location for a breath test pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 56-5-2950 (Supp. 2004).Â  At the breath test facility, he advised Williams of his implied consent rights, orally and in writing, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 56-5-2951 (Supp. 2004).Â  Upon reading the implied consent rights from the prescribed form, Trooper McKenzie requested that Williams sign a document acknowledging that he received a copy of the advisement form.Â  Williams declined to sign the document.Â  \r\nTrooper McKenzie prepared the breath test machine according to State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) procedures and waited the standard twenty minutes.Â  During that time, Williams asked numerous questions of Trooper McKenzie, but Trooper McKenzie limited his responses to the information in the SLED advisement form.Â  \r\nWhen the twenty-minute observation period elapsed and the breath test machine indicated it was time to take the test, Trooper McKenzie requested that Williams take the test.Â  Williams declined the breath test on the basis that his questions had not been answered to his satisfaction.Â  Based on Williamsâ€™ refusal, Trooper McKenzie issued Williams a Notice of Suspension.Â  \r\nThe Department suspended Williamsâ€™ driverâ€™s license for ninety days, as required by S.C. Code Ann. Section 56-5-2951 (Supp. 2004).Â  Williams requested an administrative hearing to challenge his suspension.Â  The Department held a hearing on August 20, 2003.Â  \r\nAt the administrative hearing, Trooper McKenzie maintained that Williams refused to submit to the breath test.Â  \r\nWilliams testified that when Trooper McKenzie indicated the breathalyzer machine was ready to receive a sample, he responded that he was not fully advised of his rights.Â  When questioned further about his decision to refuse the breath test, Williams stated, â€œI elected to continue trying to fully understand my rights.â€Â  Williams explained, â€œI just simply â€¦ my questions werenâ€™t being answered.â€Â  Â Â Â \r\nThe hearing officer sustained the suspension.Â  In his report, the hearing officer made the following findings of fact:\r\n\r\n6. The officer began the 20 minute observation period.Â  When the 20 minutes expired, he asked Mr. Williams if he wanted to submit to a breath test and he responded â€œNo.â€\r\n7.Â  The officer concluded that Mr. Williams refused to submit to a breath test.\r\n\r\nWilliams appealed to the circuit court, arguing he never refused to submit to the breath test, and the hearing officer made findings of fact without factual support.Â  The circuit court judge initially upheld the suspension and held there was substantial evidence in the record that would permit reasonable minds to conclude Williams refused to submit to a breath test.Â  However, he later reversed the hearing officerâ€™s decision pursuant to a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion for reconsideration.Â  In his reversing order, the judge found the hearing officer based his decision to uphold Williamsâ€™ suspension on the erroneous finding that the breath test was expressly refused.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act, S.C. Code Ann. Sections 1-23-310 to 400 (2005), establishes the â€œsubstantial evidenceâ€ rule as the standard for judicial review of a decision of an administrative agency.&nbsp; S.C. Depâ€™t of Motor Vehicles v. Nelson, 364 S.C. 514, 518, 613 S.E.2d 544, 546 (Ct. App. 2005) (quoting Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306-07 (1981)).&nbsp; The findings of an administrative agency are presumed correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence.&nbsp; Kearse v. State Health &amp; Human Servs. Fin. Commâ€™n, 318 S.C. 198, 200, 456 S.E.2d 892, 893 (1995).Â  â€œA court may not substitute its judgment for that of an agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact unless the agencyâ€™s findings are clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.â€&nbsp; Summersell v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Public Safety,&nbsp;334 S.C. 357, 363, 513 S.E.2d 619, 622 (Ct. App. 1999), vacated in part on other grounds, 337 S.C. 19, 522 S.E.2d 144 (1999).Â  Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the administrative agency reached in order to justify its action.&nbsp; Miller v. State Roofing Co., 312 S.C. 452, 454, 441 S.E.2d 323, 324-25 (1994).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Department argues that the circuit court judge erred in reversing Williamsâ€™ suspension.Â  We agree.\r\nThe circuit court judge concluded the hearing officer based his order upholding the suspension on the erroneous finding that the breath test was expressly refused.Â  Citing to Lloyd v. SCDHEC, 328 S.C. 419, 491 S.E.2d 592 (Ct. App. 1997), vacated, 332 S.C. 421, 504 S.E.2d 605 (Ct. App. 1998), for the proposition that the hearing officerâ€™s findings did not rationally support the conclusions reached, the judge reversed the hearing officerâ€™s decision.Â  \r\nWe believe the circuit court judge misapplied the applicable standard of review when he failed to consider the record as a whole.[2]Â  An appeal from action of an administrative agency must be sustained if supported by substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â Â  \r\nIt is undisputed that Williams did not expressly refuse the breath test by stating â€œnoâ€; however, S.C. Code Ann. Section 56-5-2951 (Supp. 2004) does not require an â€œexpressâ€ refusal.[3]Â  The record is replete with evidence showing Williams refused the breath test.Â  The arresting officer testified numerous times that Williams â€œelected not to provide a breath sampleâ€ and that Williams never made an attempt to take the test.Â  Williams acknowledged he was offered the breath test but declined to take it because he felt he was not fully advised of his rights.Â  Moreover, Williams never argued at the administrative hearing that he did not refuse the test; Williams acknowledged his refusal but claimed his refusal was somehow justified because his questions were not answered to his satisfaction and he did not fully understand his rights.Â  During his opening remarks at the administrative hearing, Williamsâ€™ attorney stated:\r\n\r\n[W]e believe that â€¦ that the evidence will show that â€¦ that during the advisement of rights there was some indication or comments that were inconsistent with the form and it led to some confusion and therefore there was â€¦ no test was taken.Â  Thatâ€™s not the issue.Â  The issue is in our minds was the â€¦ were the â€¦ were the advisement of rights properly given and itâ€™s our position that it wasnâ€™t a refusal based on an understanding of the rights and an exercise of that right to refuse because of some inconsistencies in â€¦ in what happened that day.\r\n\r\nThe hearing officerâ€™s erroneous finding that Williams said â€œnoâ€ does not alter the inescapable fact that the record as a whole compellingly establishes Williamsâ€™ refusal.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the order of the circuit court and reinstate the suspension.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe order of the circuit court is hereby\r\nREVERSED. \r\nSTILWELL, KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Â Â Â Â Â Â  In his order, the circuit court judge states that he considered the substantial evidence on the record as a whole; however, he reversed based on the single factual finding that Williams did not expressly refuse the breath test.Â  \r\n[3] Â Â Â Â Â Â  South Carolina Code Ann. Section 56-5-2951 (Supp. 2004) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\r\nThe Department of Motor Vehicles must suspend the driverâ€™s license, permit, or nonresident operating privilege of or deny the issuance of a license or permit to a person who drives a motor vehicle and refuses to submit to a test provided for in Section 56-5-2950 . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-597","title":"Pointes of Plantation Pointe Ownersâ€™ Association v.

Mark Hayes, II, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-597\r\nSubmitted November 1, 2005 â€“ Filed November 22, 2005Â Â \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nKarl S. Brehmer and J. Austin Hood, both of Columbia, for Appellants. \r\nJohn T. Lay, Jr. and Stephen D. Porter, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This case involves a lawsuit filed by a homeownersâ€™ association, The Pointes of Plantation Ownersâ€™ Association (the Association) against homeowners in the development, Donald and Torrie Rockwell.Â  The Rockwells appeal from the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment for the Association that dismissed certain of their counterclaims with prejudice.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  We find no error in the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal of the Rockwellsâ€™ abuse of process claim.Â  The elements of an abuse of process claim are: (1) an ulterior purpose and (2) a â€œwillfulâ€ or overt act â€œin the use of the processâ€ that is improper because it is either unauthorized or aimed at an illegitimate collateral objective.Â  Food Lion, Inc. v. United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Intâ€™l Union, 351 S.C. 65, 71, 567 S.E.2d 251, 253-54 (Ct. App. 2002). Â Importantly, an ulterior purpose or bad intention is insufficient to state a claim.Â  There must be proof that a collateral objective was the sole or paramount reason for acting.Â  â€œ[A] party who simply pursues a lawsuit with a collateral purpose in mind has done nothing improper.â€Â  Id. at 76, 567 S.E.2d at 256.Â  Here, the Associationâ€™s complaint alleges that the Rockwellsâ€™ home was not constructed according to the approved plans in certain respects.Â  The approved plans were those submitted by the Rockwells.Â  Thus, the Association simply sought an order requiring the Rockwells to comply with their own plans.Â  The Rockwellsâ€™ efforts to recast the lawsuit into something it is not finds no traction in this record.Â  Even assuming the Association pursued the action â€œwith a collateral purpose in mind,â€ there is no abuse of process.Â  This cause of action fails as a matter of law.Â  \r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  The circuit court properly granted summary judgment for the Association as to the Rockwellsâ€™ negligence counterclaim.Â  Unless a plaintiff can show a duty of care existed in a negligence action, the defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Huggins v. Citibank, N.A.,&nbsp;355 S.C. 329, 332, 585 S.E.2d 275, 276-77&nbsp;(2003).Â  The Associationâ€™s only duty in this case arose by contract.Â  See Seabrook Island Prop. Ownersâ€™ Assâ€™n v. Berger,\r\n365 S.C. 234, ___, 616 S.E.2d 431, 434 (Ct. App. 2005) (quoting Seabrook Island Prop. Owners Assâ€™n v. Pelzer, 292 S.C. 343, 347, 356 S.E.2d 411, 414 (Ct. App. 1987)) (â€œRestrictive covenants are contractual in nature and bind the parties thereto in the same manner as any other contract.â€);\r\nTommy L. Griffin Plumbing &amp; Heating Co. v. Jordan, Jones &amp; Goulding, Inc., 320 S.C. 49, 54-55, 463 S.E.2d 85, 88 (1995) (holding that no tort liability arises from a breach of contract).Â  Thus, no duty existed unless there was a special relationship between the parties.Â  Id. at 55, 463 S.E.2d at 88.Â  The Rockwells have not cited any authority holding that a special relationship is created in this situation triggering a duty in tort.Â  This argument is accordingly deemed abandoned.Â  See Glasscock, Inc. v. U.S. Fidelity and Guar. Co.,&nbsp;348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d 689, 691&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001) (â€œSouth Carolina law clearly states that short, conclusory statements made without supporting authority are deemed abandoned on appeal and therefore not presented for review.â€).Â  Therefore, the negligence counterclaim also fails as a matter of law.Â  \r\n3.Â Â Â Â Â Â  We find no error in the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal of the Rockwellsâ€™ outrage counterclaim. Â To state a claim for outrage, or intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must show that: (1) the defendant intentionally or recklessly inflicted severe emotional distress, or was certain or substantially certain that such distress would result from his conduct; (2) the conduct was so extreme and outrageous as to exceed all possible bounds of decency and must be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community; (3) the actions of the defendant caused the plaintiffâ€™s emotional distress; and (4) the emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff was so severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.Â  Bergstrom v. Palmetto Health Alliance, 358 S.C. 388, 401, 596 S.E.2d 42, 48 (2004); Talamantes v. Berkeley County Sch. Dist., 340 F. Supp. 2d 684, 691 (D.S.C. 2004).Â  The Associationâ€™s actions in this case clearly did not rise to the level of being actionable under this standard.Â  Accordingly, the trial judge correctly granted summary judgment for the Association on this counterclaim.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nSTILWELL, KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-598","title":"State v.

Gowdy, III, Seventh Circuit Solicitorâ€™s Office, of Spartanburg, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Judy Martin appeals her sentence for voluntary manslaughter in connection with the shooting death of her husband.Â  We affirm.\r\nBACKGROUND\r\nOn February 25, 2002, the Spartanburg County Grand Jury indicted Martin for the murder of her husband. On July 28, 2003, Martin entered an Alford plea to voluntary manslaughter.Â  \r\nAfter accepting Martinâ€™s plea, the trial judge acknowledged Martin was â€œraising a battered spouse defense to some extentâ€ and permitted both sides to present witnesses regarding this issue.Â  Of particular note during this hearing was the testimony of Jessie Scott Martin (Scottie), the adult son of both Martin and the victim and the only eyewitness to the incident other than Martin herself.Â  According to Scottie, the victim approached Martin while holding up a spoon in a threatening way.Â  As Martin attempted to retreat from the victim, he continued to move toward her until she backed into the living room wall.Â  Martin then pulled a pistol from her purse and started shooting.Â  Several shots misfired, but two bullets hit the victim.Â  Scottie testified Martin and the victim had always argued and fought.Â  Martin and other witnesses corroborated this statement.Â  The defense submitted pictures of Martin with bruises and other injuries.Â  The State, however, presented witnesses who asserted they knew of no abusive behavior by the victim.\r\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the trial judge concluded Martin failed to present credible evidence that criminal domestic violence played any part in the offense.Â  Specifically, the trial judge found as follows:\r\n\r\nI . . . do not find that there is credible evidence of criminal domestic violence involved in this situation.Â  I do believe that, at some point, there may [have] been [domestic violence] in these part[iesâ€™] history.Â  I donâ€™t believe that it played any part in what happened.\r\n. . .\r\nThe defendant has the burden of establishing that by the preponderance of the evidence.Â  I respectfully decline to find that thereâ€™s credible evidence, based upon what was presented, that played any part at all in this offense.\r\n\r\nBased on this reasoning, the trial judge sentenced Martin to twenty-two years imprisonment. \r\nIn Martinâ€™s initial appeal, the South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense filed an Anders brief and petition to be relieved as counsel, setting forth as the sole issue of arguable merit the contention that the trial judge erred in finding the record contained insufficient credible evidence of criminal domestic violence.Â  On December 7, 2004, this court denied the petition to be relieved as counsel and directed the parties to brief the following issues:Â  (1) whether the trial judge, in determining Martinâ€™s eligibility for parole under South Carolina Code section 16-25-90, applied the correct burden of proof regarding Martinâ€™s presentation of credible evidence of a history of criminal domestic violence suffered at the hands of the victim,[1] and (2) whether the trial judge, in determining Martinâ€™s eligibility for parole under South Carolina code section 16-25-60, incorrectly required her to prove that the incident leading to the fatal shooting of the victim resulted from domestic violence.[2]Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  After reviewing the briefs and examining the record anew, we agree with the State that the issue of whether the trial judge applied the correct burden of proof in determining Martinâ€™s eligibility for parole under South Carolina Code section 16-25-90 cannot be addressed in this appeal.Â  During the hearing, Martin never mentioned section 16-25-90 or requested any rulings regarding her eligibility for parole.Â  Moreover, we have found nothing in the record suggesting the trial judge considered the history of domestic violence between Martin and her husband as anything other than a general mitigating circumstance to support her request for a lenient sentence.[3]Â  \r\n2.Â  Likewise we do not address the issue of whether the trial judge, in determining Martinâ€™s eligibility for parole under South Carolina code section 16-25-60, incorrectly required her to prove the incident leading to the fatal shooting of the victim resulted from domestic violence.Â  Defense counsel never raised this issue to the trial judge.Â  In any event, we agree with the State that section 16-25-60 would not have been applicable to the present case.[4]\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  In 2002, South Carolina Code section 16-25-90 provided as follows:\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding any provision of Chapters 13 and 21 of Title 24, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, an inmate who was convicted of, or pled guilty or nolo contendere to, an offense against a household member shall be eligible for parole after serving one-fourth of his prison term when the inmate at the time he pled guilty to, nolo contendere to, or was convicted of an offense against the household member, or in post- conviction proceedings pertaining to the plea or conviction, presented credible evidence of a history of criminal domestic violence, as provided in Section 16-25-20, suffered at the hands of the household member. This section shall not affect the provisions of Section 17-27-45.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-25-90 (1985).Â  The statute was amended in 2003; however, the changes do not appear to be of a nature that would have affected our disposition of this appeal.\r\n[2]Â  South Carolina Code section 16-25-60 requires the court to consider the following in determining whether or not to suspend the imposition or execution of all or part of a sentence for criminal domestic violence:Â  (1) the nature and severity of the offense, the number of times the offender has repeated the offense, and the best interests and safety of the victim.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-25-60(D) (1985).Â  This section was omitted by 2003 Acts 92, Â§ 2, effective January 1, 2004.\r\n[3]Â  See State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693 (2003) (â€œIn order for an issue to be preserved for appellate review, it must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge.â€).\r\n[4]Â  Section 16-25-60 applied only to the suspension of a sentence for a conviction of criminal domestic violence, as provided in section 16-25-20 or section 16-25-50.Â  Martinâ€™s conviction was not for a criminal domestic violence offense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-599","title":"Tower v.

Mark Hayes, II, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-599\r\nSubmitted November 1, 2005 â€“ Filed November 28, 2005 Â Â Â \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Katherine Carruth Link, of W.

Polk, of Columbia, Thomas Carl Cofield, of Lexington, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this workersâ€™ compensation case, Michelle Tower appeals a circuit court order affirming the full commissionâ€™s denial of her claim for benefits.Â  Tower, an administrative assistant for the South Carolina Department of Corrections, sought benefits under the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act for an injury she sustained on October 30, 2002, when she had an altercation with another employee.Â  The Department denied Towerâ€™s claim was compensable, asserting Towerâ€™s injuries resulted from horseplay that she had instigated.Â  At issue in this appeal is whether the circuit court erred in holding substantial evidence supported the commissionâ€™s finding that Towerâ€™s claim was barred by the horseplay defense.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nTower related the following version of the incident:Â  While doing paperwork at her desk, she had soaked her hand in a cup of water because of a paper cut on her finger.Â  When she stopped soaking her hand, she stood and extended her hand to flick the water off to avoid getting water on her computer or paperwork.Â  About the same time, Thomas McQueen, an administrative manager at the Department, was meeting with Towerâ€™s supervisor near Towerâ€™s workstation.Â  Although Tower did not intend to hit anyone with the water, some that she flicked off her fingers hit McQueen.Â  McQueen then entered Towerâ€™s work station, sat in Towerâ€™s chair, grabbed Tower by the arms, threw her across his lap, and spanked her.Â  Tower tried to get away and screamed at McQueen to stop.Â  Tower sustained an injury to her neck from the incident.Â  The injury resulted in her having an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion on January 29, 2003.Â  Tower also missed work from the latter date until February 27, 2003, after which she returned to work part-time for four weeks.Â  \r\nMcQueen and Sammie Metts, Towerâ€™s supervisor, gave a different account of the incident.Â  They both contended that Tower called McQueen over and began flicking drops of water at him from across her desk.Â  Both also stated that McQueen and Tower had teased each other on previous occasions.Â  \r\nTower filed a Form 50 seeking workersâ€™ compensation benefits, alleging she was injured in the course of her employment on October 30, 2002.Â  The Department filed a Form 51 with the commission denying Towerâ€™s injuries were compensable.Â  \r\nThe single commissioner awarded Tower workersâ€™ compensation benefits, finding McQueen was the aggressor by making â€œa wholly inappropriate response to [Towerâ€™s] action of flicking water.â€Â  The Department appealed, and by a two-to-one vote, an appellate panel of the commission reversed the single commissionerâ€™s order, finding (1) Tower was injured as the result of her instigation of horseplay; (2) both Tower and McQueen had behaved inappropriately; and (3) although McQueenâ€™s actions were inappropriate to a greater degree than Towerâ€™s, his culpability did not alter the fact that Tower had been the instigator.Â  Tower then appealed to the circuit court, which upheld the order of the commission, finding all activity of both Tower and McQueen constituted horseplay and had been instigated by Tower.[2]Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  We hold the circuit court correctly determined substantial evidence supported the commissionâ€™s findings that Tower engaged in horseplay and that Towerâ€™s conduct barred her from recovering workersâ€™ compensation benefits.\r\nâ€œHorseplay is a term used to describe â€˜pranks and practical jokes which are frequently indulged in by congregated workmen.â€[3]Â  Concerning horseplay, â€œ[c]ourts generally distinguish between aggressors or instigators, who are not compensated when injured, and nonparticipating victims or innocent bystanders who are compensated.â€[4] \r\nTower stated her paper cut was under her fingernail and agreed â€œthe natural thingâ€ for her to do would have been to place only her fingertips in the water.Â  Nevertheless, she conceded that she soaked her entire hand in the cup.Â  Moreover, contrary to Towerâ€™s statements that she never intended to flick water onto anyone, McQueen testified Tower began flicking water onto him only after he approached Towerâ€™s work area at her behest and, as he moved from the front of Towerâ€™s desk to the other side, she continued to flick water onto him, laughing and â€œcutting up.â€Â  Even as McQueen was walking away, Tower continued to flick water onto him.Â  McQueen further stated that he would not have gone behind Towerâ€™s desk if she had not flicked water onto him.Â  Metts, who witnessed the entire incident, confirmed McQueenâ€™s version of the events. \r\nIn support of her argument that the commissionâ€™s finding that she instigated horseplay was not supported by substantial evidence, Tower argues (1) her actions were brief, innocuous, and non-aggressive and therefore do not rise to the level of horseplay; and (2) McQueenâ€™s misconduct was â€œseparatedâ€ from hers and â€œwas significantly more extreme than her minimal acts of teasing.â€Â  The circuit court did not address either of these arguments and the record does not show that Tower made a post-trial for the necessary rulings; therefore, they are not preserved for appeal.[5]\r\n2.Â  Tower also contends the denial of compensation was premised on an error of law.Â  In conjunction with this argument, she notes the South Carolina workersâ€™ compensation statutes do not provide an express exception to coverage for the horseplay defense.Â  She also suggests public policy warrants reexamination of the application of the horseplay defense in workers compensation cases.Â  Because, however, none of these issues were addressed by the circuit court in the appealed order, they are not preserved for our review in this appeal.[6]\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  In a handwritten order issued from the bench, the presiding circuit judge stated that, although he disagreed with the full commission, he found its decision was supported by substantial evidence.Â  \r\n[3]Â  Floyd v.

Westbrook, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-600\r\nSubmitted November 1, 2005 â€“ Filed November 30, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Mary P. Miles, of West Columbia; for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General S. Creighton Waters, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Donald V. Myers, of Lexington; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Terrance V. Smith and a codefendant were convicted in a joint trial for the offenses of murder, assault and battery with intent to kill, conspiracy and attempted armed robbery.Â  Smith appeals his convictions and argues the trial court erred in: (1) failing to grant his motion to sever; (2) failing to grant various motions in connection with the testimony of John Hayward; (3) failing to instruct the jury on self-defense; and (4) failing to grant motions for a directed verdict or a new trial.Â  We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(2), SCACR.\r\n1.Â Â The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Smithâ€™s motion to sever his trial from that of his codefendant. Smithâ€™s various arguments find no traction in this record and provide no basis for reversal.Â  State v. Dennis, 337 S.C. 275, 281, 523 S.E.2d 173, 176 (1999) (noting that defendants jointly tried for murder are not entitled to separate trials as a matter of right; the rule permitting â€œjoint trials applies with equal force when a defendantâ€™s severance motion is based upon the likelihood he and a codefendant will present mutually antagonistic defensesâ€); State v. Avery, 333 S.C. 284, 294-95, 509 S.E.2d 476, 482 (1998) (finding no abuse of discretion in denial of severance and observing that â€œif appellant had been tried separately from [his codefendant], the same evidence could have been presentedâ€); State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 122, 481 S.E.2d 118, 124 (1997) (noting that a motion for severance and separate trial is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and such determination will be sustained absent an abuse of discretion).\r\n2.Â Â The challenge to the admissibility of John Haywardâ€™s in-court identification of Smith is without merit.Â  State v. Traylor, 360 S.C. 74, 81-83, 600 S.E.2d 523, 527-28 (2004) (finding identification reliable and admissible notwithstanding suggestive procedure where witness had opportunity to observe and expressed high level of certainty); State v. Moore, 343 S.C. 282, 286-87, 540 S.E.2d 445, 447-48 (2000) (noting that an in-court identification is inadmissible if a suggestive out-of-court identification created a substantial likelihood of misidentification, and that such inquiry entails consideration of the totality of the circumstances); State v. Brown, 356 S.C. 496, 504,Â  589 S.E.2d 781, 785 (Ct. App. 2003) (noting that the factors to consider when assessing the reliability of an identification include opportunity to view the crime, degree of attention, accuracy of prior description, level of certainty and amount of time from crime to confrontation); State v. Tisdale, 338 S.C. 607, 611, 527 S.E.2d 389, 391-92 (Ct. App. 2000) (finding that the admission of identification evidence is within the discretion of the trial court, and the trial courtâ€™s determination will not be reversed absent a showing of error and prejudice).Â  Even assuming, however, error in the admission of Haywardâ€™s in-court identification of Smith, we are firmly convinced that such error would be harmless in view of the other evidence of Smithâ€™s guilt.Â  State v. Pagan, 357 S.C. 132, 144-45, 591 S.E.2d 646, 653 (Ct. App. 2004) (noting that â€œerror is harmless where it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial â€¦ [and that] [t]he admission of improper evidence is harmless where the evidence is merely cumulative to other evidenceâ€).Â  In connection with the remaining assignments of error concerning Haywardâ€™s testimony: State v. Hughes, 336 S.C. 585, 597,Â  521 S.E.2d 500, 506 (1999) (â€œThe decision whether to grant a mistrial because of a witnessâ€™s outburst rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be reversed absent an abuse thereof or manifest prejudice to the complaining party.â€); State v. Needs, 333 S.C. 134, 144, 508 S.E.2d 857, 862 (1998) (â€œâ€˜[T]his Court has more than once held that the jury is the judge of which contradictory statement of the witness is the truth.â€™â€ (quoting Soulios v.

App. 1996) (holding that â€œverdicts should not be set aside by an appellate court for misconduct in a trial, unless the evidence is clear and convincing that extraneous influences so interfered with the conduct of the trial, or so pressed upon the jury, as to become factors in the resultâ€); 98 C.J.S. Witnesses Â§ 103 (2002) (noting that false statements in a witnessâ€™s testimony â€œis considered relevant only to the extent it affects credibility, not competenceâ€); See In re Robert M, 294 S.C. 69, 70-71, 362 S.E.2d 639, 640-41 (1987) (finding that the determination of a witnessâ€™s competency rests in the discretion of the trial judge, whose decision will be affirmed absent an abuse of discretion).\r\n3.Â Â Smithâ€™s alleged error in the trial courtâ€™s failure to charge self-defense is not preserved for appellate review, for no such request was made in the trial court.Â  State v. Hicks, 330 S.C. 207, 214, 499 S.E.2d 209, 217 (1998) (finding that a failure to request specific instruction waives right to challenge issue on appeal).\r\n4.Â Â The trial court properly denied Smithâ€™s motion for a directed verdict.Â  State v.

Castengera of Newland, N.C., and Michael Jeffcoat, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Anita J. Yarborough appeals the family court order: denying her custody of the minor children, limiting her visitation, calculating child support payments, dividing the debt and marital assets, refusing alimony and rejecting her demand for assistance with attorneysâ€™ fees and guardian ad litem fees.Â Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nAnita and Douglas Yarborough were lawfully married on June 20, 1993 in Lexington County, South Carolina.Â  The parties ceased living together in January of 2001.Â  A divorce was granted on October 14, 2003, to Douglas Yarborough on the basis of continuous separation without cohabitation for one year.Â  \r\nOriginally, Anita had custody of their children, Adam and Katilin, and Douglas paid child support.Â  Douglas left Anita and the children in the marital home.Â  When asked why he left the children with their mother, he stated, â€œI was hoping that, if I left, if I moved out in January [2001], that she would stay here in South Carolina so I could see my kids.â€ However in August of 2001, Anita and the children moved to Humble, Texas to live with her parents.Â  Anita claimed the move was for financial reasons, because she was unemployed.Â  Douglas had telephone visitation every Tuesday and Thursday night from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time and visitation privileges every Christmas and summer.\r\nIn Texas, the mother and children lived in a trailer with Anitaâ€™s mother, step-father, sister, brother and the brotherâ€™s girlfriend.Â  Adam began experiencing some behavior problems.Â  Anita had difficulty getting the children home to talk to their father at the scheduled time.Â  She blamed this on the fact that Texas was in the Central Time Zone.Â  Consequently, telephone visitation became sporadic.Â  In November of 2000, seven-year-old Adam crashed an ATV into Billy Harwellâ€™s truck.Â  This caused significant damage to the vehicle.Â  He was neither supervised at the time of the accident nor taken to the doctor after the crash took place.Â  Adamâ€™s father did not know about the accident until Mr. Harwell contacted him.Â  In August of 2002, Anita and her brother, Rusty, were involved in a physical altercation at the house in Texas.Â  Anita called the police, and Rusty was thrown out of the house by his mother.Â  According to Adam, Rusty grabbed Adam by the neck and swung him around the room.Â  Douglas was unaware of this event until Adam later told him about it over the phone.Â  \r\nDouglas scheduled a time to pick up his children on December 21, 2002, for Christmas vacation.Â  Douglas and Anita planned to meet halfway at a police station in Mobile, Alabama, but Anita was over two hours late. Douglas could not get in touch with her or her family, and Anita did not attempt to contact him.Â  After filing a police report, he returned to South Carolina.Â Â  \r\nAn Ex Parte Order granting an Emergency or Expedited Hearing was filed on January 15, 2003.Â  Douglas received custody of his children.Â  On February 27, 2003, an order was filed awarding temporary custody of the children to the father until the final divorce proceeding.Â  \r\nThe family court granted custody to the father, concluding this would be in the best interest of both children.Â  The mother was granted telephone visitation, Christmas, summer and spring break visitation.Â  Furthermore, she is allowed to see her children for reasonable periods of overnight visitation when she is in South Carolina.Â  The family court imputed a $930.00 per month minimum wage to Anita, who was unemployed at the time of the trial.Â  Anita owes $304.85 per month in child support to be paid to the Clerk of Court of Lexington with a 5% handling fee.Â  The court found the marital debt, property and Guardian ad Litem fees should be divided in half.Â  Additionally, the court found each party responsible for their own attorneysâ€™ fees.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\nÂ In family court appeals, this court may find facts in agreement with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Lanier v. Lanier, 364 S.C. 211, 612 S.E.2d 456 (Ct. App. 2005); Nasser-Moghaddassi v. Moghaddassi, 364 S.C.182, 612 S.E.2d 707 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Regardless of our broad scope of review however, we are not required to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 561 S.E.2d 610 (Ct. App. 1999); Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 522 S.E.2d 835 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Nor do we ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate the credibility and assign comparative weight to the witnessesâ€™ testimony.Â  Lacke v. Lacke, 362 S.C. 302, 608 S.E.2d 147 (Ct. App. 2005); Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C.322, 526 S.E.2d 241 (Ct. App. 1999); see also Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 477 S.E.2d 476 (Ct. App. 1996) (noting that because the appellate court lacks the opportunity for direct observation of witnesses, it should accord great deference to the family courtâ€™s findings where matters of credibility are involved).Â  An appellate court â€œshould be reluctant to substitute its own evaluation of the evidence on child custody for that of the trial court.â€ Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â  However, when the best interests of the child are compromised by the family courtâ€™s visitation schedule, we have the ability to use de novo review.Â  Arnal v. Arnal, 363 S.C. 268, 609 S.E.2d 821 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  The burden weighs heavily on the appellant who must convince this Court the family court committed error.Â  Skinner v. King, 272 S.C. 520, 522-523, 252 S.E.2d 891, 892 (1979). \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.&nbsp;Custody\r\nAnita Yarborough argues that the family court erred in awarding custody to Douglas Yarborough.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe most important and controlling factor in every custody dispute is the best interests of the children.Â  Shirley v. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324, 330, 536 S.E.2d 427, 430 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Parapella v. Parapella, 340 S.C. 186, 189 531 S.E.2d 297, 299 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  However many aspects must be considered to determine the best interests of a child and thus the outcome of a child custody case.Â  Pirayesh v. Pirayesh, 359 S.C. 284, 596 S.E.2d 505 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œIn reaching a determination as to custody, the family court should consider how the custody decision will impact all areas of the childâ€™s life, including physical, psychological, spiritual, educational, familial, emotional and recreational aspects.â€Â  Shirley, 342 S.C. at 330, 536 S.E.2d at 430.Â  â€œAdditionally, the court must assess each partyâ€™s character, fitness and attitude as they impact the child.â€ Id.Â  The Pirayesh court noted that the opinions of third parties (including the guardian, expert witnesses, and the children) should be taken into account when determining custody.Â  Furthermore this court must consider that in South Carolina, there is a presumption against moving children out of the state.Â  Rice v. Rice, 335 S.C. 449, 454, 517 S.E.2d 220, 222 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The court must determine if moving is in the best interest of the child. Id.\r\nExtensive testimony was presented regarding the parenting habits and practices of both parents.Â  Jack Justice, a licensed social worker, and Sheila M. Robinson, the Guardian ad Litem, testified.Â  Justice, a therapist at the Columbia Counseling Center, was qualified as an expert witness in the field of therapy.Â  Justice met with Adam, Katilin and Douglas approximately ten times before the trial.Â  Justice testified that â€œ[Douglas Yarborough] is a good father.Â  I think he has his childrenâ€™s best interest [sic] at heart.â€Â  Moreover, Robinson reported that both (Anitaâ€™s and Douglasâ€™s) homes were suitable, and that both were good parents.Â  Daycare workers vouched for the improvement in Katilinâ€™s behavior since moving in with her father.Â  Adam made excellent progress in school after relocating.Â  The family court did not err in determining that the best interests of the children would be served by giving the father custody.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;Limiting visitation \r\nAnita Yarborough appeals the visitation parameters set forth by the trial court, specifically the time and type of visitation and transportation costs. \r\nAs always â€œwhen awarding visitation, the controlling consideration is the welfare and best interest[s] of the child[ren].â€Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 12, 471 S.E.2d 154, 158 (1996).Â  â€œA family court may impose upon a non-custodial parent such conditions and restrictions on visitation privileges as the court in its discretion, thinks proper.â€ Frye v. Frye, 323 S.C. 72, 448 S.E.2d 586 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  â€œ[D]etermining and limiting visitation rights is in the broad discretion of the trial judge, and in the absence of a clear abuse of such, the order granting, denying or limiting visitation rights will not be disturbed.â€ Graham v. Graham, 253 S.C. 486, 171 S.E.2d 704 (1970).Â  Furthermore this court must recognize that â€œ[v]isitation arrangements are not allowed that involve excessive shuttling of the children between parents.â€Â  Mixson v. Mixson, 253 S.C. 436, 171 S.E.2d 581 (1969).Â  Thus, when the best interests of the children are compromised by the family courtâ€™s visitation schedule, we have the ability to use de novo review.Â  Arnal, 363 S.C. at 291, 609 S.E.2d at 833 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nAnita chose to live in Humble, Texas, which is roughly seventeen hours and one thousand miles away from her children.Â  The trial court awarded four weeks of visitation with Anita in Texas, divided into two (2) two-week visits.Â  Under these circumstances, this constitutes excessive shuttling of the children between South Carolina and Texas.Â  As an alternative, Anita should have one five-week period of visitation each summer, not to include the week after school ends or the week before school begins.Â  Anita shall provide Douglas with notice of which weeks she is choosing for visitation via registered mail no later than April 1 of each year.Â  In addition, we find it to be in the childrenâ€™s best interests for Anita to have telephone contact.Â  Anita is entitled to telephone contact beginning at 8:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time each Tuesday and Thursday.Â  Anita is responsible for initiating the calls.Â  During the five (5) weeks of summer visitation with Anita, Douglas shall have the same right of telephone contact with the children.Â  During this time Douglas will be responsible for initiating the calls.Â  This court declines to further modify the visitation. \r\nIII.&nbsp;Calculating child support \r\nAnita argues that the family court erred in imputing her child support obligation.Â  We disagree. \r\nS.C. Code Ann.Â  Â§ 20-7-90 (1976) provides in part:\r\n\r\n  (A)&nbsp;Any able-bodied person capable of earning a livelihood who shall, without just cause or excuse, abandon or fail to provide reasonable support to his or her spouse or to his or her minor unmarried legitimate or illegitimate child dependent on him or her shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor . . . .\r\n\r\nThe factors to be considered in establishing child support obligations include: both parentsâ€™ income, ability to pay, education, expenses, and assets, as well as the facts and circumstances surrounding each case.Â  Mitchell v. Mitchell, 283 S.C. 87, 320 S.E.2d 706 (1989).Â  â€œThe award should be an amount that the parent can pay and still meet his or her own needs.â€ Smith v. Delaney, 286 S.C. 583, 334 S.E.2d 821 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  \r\nThe judge used the South Carolina Child Support Guidelines to calculate the amount of child support Anita owed each month.Â  According to Guidelines, Section III (A) (5):\r\n\r\n  If the court finds that a parent is voluntarily unemployed or underemployed, it should calculate child support based on a determination of potential income which would otherwise ordinarily be available to the parent.\r\n\r\nPrior to moving to Texas, Anita worked for the State of South Carolina.Â  After her move, she worked for a temporary agency and for her mother.Â Â  Although at trial she was unemployed, the judge correctly imputed that Anita was able to earn a minimum wage.Â  Anita has a duty to support her children.Â  \r\nIV.&nbsp;&nbsp;Division of debt and marital assets\r\nAnita Yarborough contends that the family court erred in the division of the marital property and debts.Â  We disagree. \r\nâ€œThe doctrine of equitable distribution is based on a recognition that marriage is, among other things, an economic partnership.â€ Mallett v. Mallett, 323 S.C. 141, 150, 473 S.E.2d 804, 810 (Ct. App. 1996). â€œUpon dissolution of the marriage, marital property should be divided and distributed in a manner which fairly reflects each spouseâ€™s contribution to its acquisition, regardless of who holds legal title.â€ Morris v. Morris, 335 S.C. 525, 531, 517 S.E.2d 720, 723 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  In making an equitable distribution of marital property, the family court must, among other things: (1) identify the marital property, both real and personal, to be divided between the parties; (2) determine the fair market value of the identified property; (3) apportion the marital estate according to the contributions, both direct and indirect, of each party to the acquisition of the property during the marriage, their respective assets and incomes, and any special equities they may have in marital assets; and (4) provide for an equitable division of the marital estate, including the manner in which the distribution is to take place. Noll v. Noll, 297 S.C. 190, 375 S.E.2d 338 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\nThe only marital property owned by the parties is real property located at 5736 Augusta Highway in Leesville, South Carolina.Â  The value of this property is Thirty-One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars and 00/100 ($31,500.00).Â  The equity in the home is Five Thousand Five Hundred and 00/100 ($5,500.00).Â  Anita will receive a check from Douglas in the amount of Two Thousand Seven Hundred and Fifty Dollars and 00/100 ($2,750.00).Â  We affirm the family courtâ€™s division of property and the manner of distribution.\r\nV.&nbsp;Alimony\r\nAnita asserts that the family court erred by not awarding her alimony.Â  We disagree. \r\nNo issue may be raised for the first time on appeal, instead it must have been raised at trial in order to preserve the issue for appeal.Â  State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 481 S.E.2d 118 (1997).Â  Even if the issue were preserved, â€œ[t]he decision to grant or deny alimony is within the sound discretion of the family court judge, whose decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.â€Â  Hatfield v. Hatfield, 327 S.C. 360, 364, 489 S.E.2d 212, 215 (Ct. App. 1997) (citing Williamson v. Williamson, 311 S.C. 47, 426 S.E.2d 758 (1993)).Â  \r\nThe S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C)(Supp. 2003) states:\r\n\r\n  The family court must consider and give weight in such proportion as it finds appropriate to the following factors in determining an award of alimony: (1) duration of the marriage and ages of the parties at the time of the marriage and divorce; (2)physical and emotional condition of the parties; (3) educational background and need for additional education of the parties; (4) employment history and earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living established during the marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated income of the parties; (7) current and reasonably anticipated expenses and needs of the parties; (8) marital and non-marital properties of the parties; (9) custody of the children; (10) marital misconduct or fault that affects the economic circumstances of the parties or contributes to the break-up of the marriage; (11) tax consequences of the reward; (12) prior support obligations of the parties; and (13) other factors the court considers relevant. \r\n\r\nAnita and Douglas were married for approximately ten years, living together for about eight and a half years.Â  Both were around thirty-one years of age at the time of the divorce.Â  The physical and emotional state of each party was not discussed at trial, although it was evident that both were physically healthy and neither one wanted to reconcile the marriage.Â  Anita testified that she graduated from college in 1993, although she never specified what college she attended or what degree she received.Â  Anita and Douglas have employment history, and each have the potential to find and continue employment based on their job history.Â  The standard of living as established during the marriage has remained unchanged for both parties.Â  After the birth of their children, Anita did not work.Â  Douglas has custody; therefore, her expenses should be less.Â  Fault was not an issue at the trial.Â  The trial judge did not abuse his discretion by failing to award Anita alimony. \r\nVI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Attorneysâ€™ fees and guardian ad litem fees\r\nAnita appeals the failure of the family court to award her attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  Additionally, she attacks the division of the Guardian ad Litem fees.\r\nThe award of attorneyâ€™s fees is at the sound discretion of the family court. Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, 368 S.E.2d 901 (1988).Â  In deciding whether to award attorneysâ€™ fees, the family court should consider: (1) the partiesâ€™ ability to pay their own fees; (2) the beneficial results obtained by counsel; (3) the respective financial conditions of the parties; and (4) the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living. E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 415 S.E.2d 812 (1992); Shirley, 342 S.C. 324, 536 S.E.2d 427.Â  Our Supreme Court has identified the following factors for determining a reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee: (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) professional standing of counsel; (4) contingency of compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained; and (6) customary legal fees for similar services. Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403 S.E.2d 313 (1991).\r\nAlthough she is unemployed, Anita has marketable job skills.Â Â Â  Douglas has retained his job with Cooper Power Tools for over 6 years.Â  The father received custody of the two minor children thus maintaining his standard of living prior to the divorce.Â  Anita ameliorated her financial difficulty by moving in with her parents in Texas.Â  Neither partyâ€™s standard of living changed as a result of the divorce, nor was the divorce granted on a fault basis.Â  This case was not overly difficult and did not present any novel issues of law.Â  Both parties have the ability to work and to pay attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  Therefore, we find the family court did not abuse its discretion in deciding each party would bear his or her own attorneyâ€™s fees and costs. \r\nAn award of GAL fees lies within the sound discretion of the family court judge and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324, 341, 536 S.E.2d 427, 436.Â  In the present case, the GAL completed an independent, balanced, and impartial investigation, as is required by the court.Â  The GAL reduced her rate to $110.00 per hour.Â  She conducted home visits in South Carolina and Texas.Â  She interviewed 23 witnesses.Â  Her fee requirement is fair and should not create a hardship.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n Accordingly, the family courtâ€™s ruling is \r\nAFFIRMED as MODIFIED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concurÂ  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-602","title":"Prince v.

Gibson, Jr., and Mary Bass Lohr, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Danny Prince appeals the trial courtâ€™s denial of several motions in conjunction with his medical malpractice case against Beaufort Memorial Hospital.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nBeaufort Memorial Hospital (the Hospital) admitted Prince on February 13, 1999, with job related injuries.Â  From that day until the night of February 17, Prince was a compliant patient who exhibited no signs of abnormal or psychotic behavior.Â  Sometime after 10:30 p.m. on February 17, Prince apparently experienced a psychotic hallucination in his hospital room.Â  \r\nAt 11:20 p.m., Hospital staff found Prince on the roof of the second floor with injuries to his ankles and head resulting from an apparent fall or jump from his fourth floor room.Â  Although Prince does not remember anything from the incident, including how he got out of his room or onto the roof, the window in his room showed signs of being forced open.Â  \r\nPat Foulger is the Hospitalâ€™s Vice President and holds positions on many Hospital committees including the P.I. or Quality Assurance Committee (hereafter the â€œQuality Assurance Committeeâ€).Â  The Quality Assurance Committee investigated the incident involving Prince.Â  Counsel for Prince requested a copy of the file created during the investigation.Â  The Hospital answered by providing a summary of expected witness testimony, but refused to turn over the file claiming it was protected under South Carolina Code Sections 40-71-10 &amp; 20 (2001 &amp; Supp. 2004).Â  The circuit court denied Princeâ€™s motions to compel discovery of the complete file.Â  Following trial the jury returned a defense verdict.Â  Thereafter, Prince filed timely motions requesting a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) and a new trial, which were denied.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Was the trial court correct in ruling the Hospital&rsquo;s Quality Assurance Committee file was confidential and thus, not subject to discovery under Section 40-71-10 &amp; 20?&nbsp; \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Was the trial court correct in declining to entertain an in camera review of the alleged confidential committee file?\r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Confidentiality\r\nThe Hospital claims that Sections 40-71-10 &amp; 40-71-20 of the South Carolina Code protect the file in dispute.Â  Prince argues that the file was not protected because the Quality Assurance Committee did not meet the conditions of confidentiality as set out in Section 40-71-10.Â  Section 40-71-10 (a) states:\r\n\r\n  â€œProfessional societyâ€ as used in this chapter includes legal, medical, osteopathic, optometric, chiropractic, psychological, dental, accounting, pharmaceutic, and engineering organizations having as members at least a majority of the eligible licentiates in the area served by the particular society and any foundations composed of members of these societies. It also includes the South Carolina Law Enforcement Accreditation Council.\r\n\r\nFurther, Section 40-71-10 (b) provides immunity for:\r\n\r\n  an appointed member of a committee of a medical staff of a licensed hospital, provided the medical staff operates pursuant to written bylaws that have been approved by the governing board of the hospital . . . for any act or proceeding undertaken or performed within the scope of the functions of the committee.\r\n\r\nIn this case the record shows that the Quality Assurance Committee operates pursuant to bylaws.Â  Prince argues no evidence was presented to show that a majority of the Committee members were licentiates.Â  However, Ms. Foulgerâ€™s deposition testimony states that the Quality Assurance Committee has three medical staff members and three board members, one of which is a physician.Â  Ms. Foulger testifies that the committee is made up of about 50% licensed medical personnel.Â  \r\nThe plain language of Section 40-71-10 provides that a committee, acting pursuant to bylaws, at a hospital or in a medical field, will be exempt from tort liability.Â  The Hospitalâ€™s Committee is the type described in Taylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 213, 479 S.E.2d 35, 42 (1996).Â  In that case, Dr. Medenica claimed that there was a committee and its file was privileged.Â  The court acknowledged that a peer review committee file would be confidential, but found that the information used during trial came from an independent source.Â  Also, a similar committee has been held by our supreme court to be protected by Sections 40-71-10 &amp; 20 in McGee v. Bruce Hospital System, 312 S.C. 58, 61, 439 S.E.2d 257, 259 (1993).Â  Therefore, we find that there was evidence that the committee in question met the specifications of Section 40-71-10.Â  \r\nSection 40-71-20 provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  All proceedings of and all data and information acquired by the committee referred to in Section 40-71-10 in the exercise of its duties are confidential unless a respondent in the proceeding requests in writing that they be made public. These proceedings and documents are not subject to discovery, subpoena, or introduction into evidence in any civil action except upon appeal from the committee action. Information, documents, or records which are otherwise available from original sources are not immune from discovery or use in a civil action merely because they were presented during the committee proceedings nor shall any complainant or witness before the committee be prevented from testifying in a civil action as to matters of which he has knowledge apart from the committee proceedings or revealing such matters to third persons. \r\n\r\nPrince argues that no witnesses ever appeared before any committee.Â  While this assertion is true and reflected in the record, there is also evidence that Pat Foulger talked to witnesses in an informal setting, collected incident reports, and obtained statements from the hospital personnel involved in Princeâ€™s incident.Â  The statute protects information that is acquired by a committee.Â  Section 40-71-20 does not require witnesses to appear before the whole committee in order to satisfy the confidentiality requirements.Â  \r\nPrince was, however, entitled to documents recording the outcome of the quality assurance review pursuant to McGee.Â  See McGee, 312 S.C. 58, 63, 439 S.E.2d 257, 260 (1993) (holding â€œthe outcome of the decision-making process is not protected.â€).Â  Judge Gregory denied Prince this specific discovery request.Â  While this is error, it is not prejudicial error in light of the fact that the Hospital confirmed in their answers to interrogatories that â€œno one was suspended, charged or cited with any violation of hospital rules, standards, laws, policy or procedures as a result of the [Prince incident].â€Â  \r\nSections 40-71-10 &amp; 20 have been the subject of only a few cases on appeal.Â  The first one, the McGee case, was granted certiorari to the South Carolina Supreme Court in 1993 as a novel issue of law.Â  Following McGee, this issue was briefly considered in the Taylor case in 1996.Â  The last case dealing with Sections 40-71-10 and 20 is Durham v. Vinson, 360 S.C. 639, 602 S.E.2d 760 (2004).Â  McGee, Taylor, and Durham all involve medical malpractice claims seeking disclosure of the doctorsâ€™ applications for staff privileges, whereas this case involves an accident at the Hospital.Â  Nevertheless, the statute was written broadly enough to protect all proceedings and all information acquired by a committee during an investigation. \r\nâ€œThe overriding public policy of the confidentiality statute is to encourage health care professionals to monitor the competency and professional conduct of their peers to safeguard and improve the quality of patient care.â€Â  See McGee 312 S.C. at Â­Â­Â­Â­61, 439 S.E.2d at 259.Â  The Hospital in this case was investigating the Prince incident in order to monitor its own actions, and to take steps to further protect its patients.Â  Sections 40-71-10 &amp; 20 provide safeguards to hospitals while conducting this exact type of investigation. \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  In Camera Review\r\nPrince also argues that the trial judge erred in failing to review the committee file in camera.Â  The trial judge found the file was confidential and thus declined to review it.Â  After our review of the record, however, we feel the nature of this case demands an in camera review of the file.Â  Prince had no memory of the incident, and the only investigative body was the Hospital, a naturally biased entity.Â  In camera reviews should be used liberally to guard against even a mere possibility a miscarriage of justice will occur.Â  Therefore, it was error for the trial judge to decline to review the Hospitalâ€™s Quality Assurance Committee file.[1]\r\nOn remand the circuit court shall conduct an in camera review of the committee file.Â  Using its discretion, the court shall decide whether the file warrants confidentiality.Â  If the circuit court determines that the file contains relevant evidence which is not protected by the confidentiality statute, then it shall declare a new trial.Â  Alternatively, if the circuit court determines that there is no relevant evidence in the committee file or that the file is entitled to the protections of the confidentiality statute, then the original denial of a new trial and JNOV motion would be affirmed.\r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s decision is\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur\r\n\r\n[1] During the 2005 legislative session, the General Assembly amended Chapter 71, Title 40 of the 1976 Code by adding Section 40-71-30 which provides:\r\n\r\n  When a party asserts a claim of confidentiality over documents pursuant to Section 40-71-20 and the party seeking the documents objects, the documents must be filed under seal with the circuit court having jurisdiction over the pending action and are subject to judicial review by the circuit court judge.Â  If the court determines that any of the documents are not subject to confidentiality pursuant to Section 40-71-20 and are otherwise discoverable, the court shall provide the documents to the requesting party.Â  In the event the court finds that a party acted unreasonably in unsuccessfully asserting the claim of confidentiality, the court shall assess attorneyâ€™s fees against that party for any fees incurred by the requesting party in obtaining the documents.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-603","title":"Vaughn v.

Pope, of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\n        Joseph Collins Smithdeal, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this workersâ€™ compensation action, Salem Carriers and Virginia Surety Carrier appeal the trial courtâ€™s order affirming the order of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (Commission), which awarded benefits to Faye Vaughn for the death of her husband, Robert Vaughn.Â  We affirm.1\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nSalem Carriers employed Robert primarily as a drop and hook driver from December 1996 until his death on July 7, 1999.Â  As a drop and hook driver, Robert transported box trailers filled with textiles from the Sara Lee plant in Hodges, South Carolina to another plant location, dropped off the trailer, picked up a trailer, and then returned to the plant in Hodges.Â  A drop and hook operation is considered light duty work for a truck driver. Â \r\nDuring the week of July 1 through 7 of 1999, the Sara Lee plants were shut down and Robert was not scheduled to drive.Â  Robert agreed, however, to substitute as a flatbed truck driver for Salem Carrierâ€™s RMAX account.Â  Driving a flatbed truck typically requires more physical activity than a drop and hook operation of dropping off and hooking up to loads.Â  Flatbed driving often involves securing the load, requiring tarping, climbing, and strapping by the driver.Â  The strapping and tarping occurs after the truck has been loaded, and the loading usually takes fifteen to twenty minutes for a load the size of the one Robert was driving.Â  One of the drivers who Robert substituted for at the time of his death, Eugene Miller, testified about the normal process for securing a load.Â  Miller testified that at the RMAX plant, if he was present he would observe the product being loaded, but sometimes it was loaded without him being there.Â  In securing the load, a driver first has to throw six or seven straps over the load.Â  He then has to climb up a thirteen-foot ladder, which is like an airplane ladder, onto the top of the load and get on his hands and knees in order to straighten the straps.Â  He would stand up to go to the next strap and then get down on his hands and knees again.Â  He would also put corner pieces on to keep the load from being damaged.Â  He then climbs back down the ladder and hooks the straps and tightens them with a metal bar.Â  Finally, the driver would usually put a tarp weighing twenty to thirty pounds, over the load, climb back up the ladder, and then spread the tarp over the load. He would then secure the tarp by hooking thirty or forty bungee cords onto the tarp, tighten the cords, and then hook them to the side of the trailer.Â  The strapping and tarping normally takes from thirty minutes to an hour and fifteen minutes, depending on the driver.Â  \r\nWhile working for Salem Carriers, Robert drove a flatbed truck only three days in 1998 and for two days in July 1999 before the day of his death.Â  It is undisputed Robert was a drop and hook driver, as opposed to a flatbed driver, ninety-eight to ninety-nine percent of the time he was employed with Salem Carriers.Â  When Robert came home after his first day as a substitute driver during the first week of July, 1999, his wife testified that he was dragging, gray, ashy, and sweating.Â  After he worked July 1 and 2, he was off for a long weekend.Â  Over that weekend he did a little painting and wallpapering, and cut the grass with a riding mower, but did not perform any strenuous activities.Â  According to Fayeâ€™s testimony, on July 6, Robert arrived home early and appeared normal.Â  Robertâ€™s log sheet indicated he was present at the RMAX plant from ten in the morning until noon that day.Â  The log sheet does not specify what he was doing at the plant for that time and the parties dispute whether the truck was loaded and Robert secured it on that date or whether the truck may have just been loaded then.Â  \r\nThe record shows on July 7, Robert was at the RMAX plant for approximately one hour and twenty-three minutes before he left the plant with his secured load.Â  At 9:08 a.m., after driving from the RMAX plant in Greer into downtown Greenville, Vaughn called for an ambulance.Â  Once it arrived, he told the emergency medical technician that he began having chest pains while he was securing his load around 8:00 that morning.Â  Robert was taken to the emergency room and died that same day from cardiac arrest.Â  \r\nMiller testified it was not unusual on this route for a truck to be loaded and left overnight without it having been strapped or tarped by the driver.Â  He further stated, based on his experience, he believed Robert did not take possession and control of the load until July 7, when he signed the bill of lading, and that he was of the opinion Robert spent the morning of July 7 at the RMAX plant securing his load.Â  Miller also opined that for the two hours Robert was at RMAX on July 6, he was waiting to get his truck loaded.Â  David Doherty, who was presented as an expert witness in the field of trucking operations, testified that during the two hours Robert was at the plant on July 6, he could have been repositioning his trailer, performing an inspection on his trailer, or waiting for it to be loaded but encountered a problem and the loading was not completed.Â  He stated that trailers like this could be loaded in the driverâ€™s absence.Â  Doherty was of the opinion Robert was hooking up his trailer and strapping and tarping his load on the morning of his death.Â  \r\nRobertâ€™s personal physician, Internist Dr. Russell Hall, testified, although Robert had previously undergone some cardiac testing in 1998, he was considered at low risk for a cardiac event at that time.Â  Further, while Robert had a history of transient ischemic attack, or a stroke that resolved itself, dating back to 1991, this condition was the result of a mitral valve prolapse which had nothing to do with his heart attack.Â  After review of Robertâ€™s hospital records from the day of his death, he agreed Robert had severe coronary artery disease.Â  Dr. Hall stated that if Robert did not usually secure a load as part of his usual job, and if he secured a load on the morning of July 7, he was of the opinion that the securing of the load provoked his heart attack.Â  It was his opinion that the exertion involved, which was above and beyond what he was accustomed to doing in the course of his job, had a role in precipitating the heart attack.Â  \r\nFaye initiated a workerâ€™s compensation claim.Â  Salem Carriers denied the claim asserting Robertâ€™s death was not causally related to the work he performed and there was no unusual stress or strain involving the work that caused Robertâ€™s heart attack.Â  The Single Commissioner denied Fayeâ€™s claim, finding the evidence showed Robert secured the truckâ€™s load the day before the heart attack, and therefore Robert did not experience any unusual stress or strain on the day of his death.Â  Faye appealed to the Full Commission, which reversed the decision of the Single Commissioner, finding the evidence showed Robert secured his load on the day of his death and that he was involved in strenuous physical exertion that was an unusual and extraordinary condition of his employment on that day.Â  The Commission further found medical evidence supported a finding that the unusual and extraordinary exertion caused Robertâ€™s heart attack by aggravating a preexisting heart condition.Â  The circuit court affirmed, finding substantial evidence of record supported the Commissionâ€™s order.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  â€œIn workersâ€™ compensation cases, the Full Commission is the ultimate fact finder.â€Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  â€œThe final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is specifically reserved to the Full Commission.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nAn appellate court may reverse or modify the Commissionâ€™s decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the findings or conclusions of the commission are â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005).Â  â€œSubstantial evidenceâ€ is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor evidence viewed blindly from one side, but is evidence which, when considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the agency reached.Â  Palmetto Alliance, Inc. v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 282 S.C. 430, 432, 319 S.E.2d 695, 696 (1984).Â  The possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not preclude the agencyâ€™s finding from being supported by substantial evidence. Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â  Findings of Fact\r\nSalem Carriers argues the circuit court erred when it found substantial evidence supported the Full Commissionâ€™s findings that (1) the truck was loaded on the day of Robertâ€™s heart attack; (2) securing the load was an unusual or extraordinary condition of employment; and (3) unusual and extraordinary conditions of employment caused Robertâ€™s heart attack.Â  We disagree.\r\nA.Â Â  Loading the Truck\r\nSalem Carriers argues the finding that the truck was loaded on the day of Robertâ€™s heart attack is unsupported by substantial evidence and that Faye failed to prove Robert secured his load on that day.Â  Accordingly, it contends there is no temporal connection between any exertion and the heart attack.Â  We disagree.\r\nFirst, it should be noted there was no finding that the truck was loaded on the day of Robertâ€™s heart attack.Â  Rather, the Commission found Robert was securing his load on July 7 when he began experiencing chest pains.Â  Neither the Full Commission nor the circuit court made a finding regarding which day the truck was loaded.Â  The question to be determined is not when the truck was loaded, but when Robert secured that load, which required the physical exertion by Robert.Â  \r\nMiller testified it would not be unusual for a truck to be loaded and left overnight without it having been secured by the driver, and Doherty indicated trailers were at times loaded in the driverâ€™s absence.Â  Based on his experience, Miller believed Robert did not take possession and control of the load until July 7, when he signed the bill of lading, and that Robert spent the morning of July 7 at the RMAX plant securing his load. It was Dohertyâ€™s expert opinion that Robert was hooking up his trailer and strapping and tarping his load on the morning of his death.Â  Further, there was evidence that Robert told an emergency medical technician on July 7 that his chest pains began as he was securing his load around 8:00 that morning.Â  Finally, there is evidence Robert had been at the plant for one hour and twenty-three minutes before he left the plant with his secured load on July 7, giving him enough time to secure the load that morning.Â  Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the Commissionâ€™s finding that Robert secured his load on the day of his death.\r\nB.Â Â  Unusual or Extraordinary ConditionsÂ Â  \r\nSalem Carriers also argues substantial evidence does not support the Commissionâ€™s finding that securing the load was an unusual or extraordinary condition of Robertâ€™s employment resulting in his heart attack.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n  If an employee dies of a heart attack . . . he or she must show not only that the injury was in the course of employment but also that the death arose out of employment, in that it was brought about by unexpected strain or over-exertion, or as a result of unusual and extraordinary conditions of employmentÂ  However, if such an injury results as a consequence of the ordinary exertion that is required in the performance of employment duties in the ordinary and usual manner, and without any outward untoward event, it is not compensable as an accident.\r\n\r\nJennings v. Chambers Dev. Co., 335 S.C. 249, 255, 516 S.E.2d 453, 456 (Ct. App. 1999) (citations omitted).Â  Salem Carriers bases its appeal on the fact that securing a load is usual and ordinary for a flatbed truck driver.Â  While this is true, Robert was employed primarily in the light duty position of a drop and hook driver and rarely drove a flatbed truck for the company.Â  He was a drop and hook driver ninety-eight to ninety-nine percent of the time he was employed with Salem Carriers, having driven a flatbed truck only three days in 1998 and two days in July 1999 before the day of his death.Â  Thus, substantial evidence supports the Commissionâ€™s finding that securing the load for the flatbed operation was an unusual and extraordinary condition of Robertâ€™s employment duties.\r\nC.Â Â  Causation\r\nNext, Salem Carriers argues there was no substantial evidence of record to support a finding that Robertâ€™s heart attack was caused by unusual and extraordinary conditions of employment.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn order for a death from a heart attack to be compensable, it must arise out of employment, in that it is brought about by unexpected strain or over-exertion, or as a result of unusual and extraordinary conditions of employment.Â  Jennings, 335 S.C at 255, 516 S.E.2d at 456.Â  Here, Dr. Hall testified that if Robert did not usually secure a load as part of his usual job, and if he secured a load on the morning of July 7, he was of the opinion that the securing of the load provoked Robertâ€™s heart attack.Â  It was Dr. Hallâ€™s opinion that the exertion above and beyond what Robert was accustomed to doing in the course of his job had a role in precipitating his heart attack.Â  Further, the doctor who treated Robert at the hospital the morning he had the heart attack, Dr. Cebe, testified, in order to correlate a heart attack with extreme exertion, there must be a temporal relationship between the exertion and the onset of symptoms.Â  Dr. Cebe further stated unusual physical exertion can trigger a heart attack, and he was of the opinion, assuming the level of physical exertion described and based on what he had seen in Robertâ€™s medical records, that Robertâ€™s heart attack was related to the physical exertion he experienced at 8:00 on the morning of his death.Â  \r\nWe hold substantial evidence supports the Commissionâ€™s finding that Robert was involved in strenuous physical exertion that was an unusual and extraordinary condition of his employment and that the unusual and extraordinary exertion caused Robertâ€™s heart attack by aggravating a preexisting heart condition.\r\nII.Â Â  Error of Law\r\nFinally, Salem Carriers argues Faye did not meet her burden of proof, and therefore, the award of benefits was an error of law.Â  It argues whatever Robert was doing on the morning of his death was sheer speculation, and therefore the claim must fail.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Full Commission found that (1) Robert was securing his load on July 7 when he began having chest pain; (2) as a substitute flatbed truck driver, Robert was engaged in strenuous physical exertion that was an unusual and extraordinary condition of employment for Robert; and (3) medical evidence supported a finding that the unusual and extraordinary physical exertion caused the heart attack by aggravating a pre-existing heart condition.Â  As previously noted, substantial evidence supports the Commissionâ€™s finding that Robert secured his load on the morning of his death, and that securing the load for the flatbed operation was an unusual and extraordinary condition of Robertâ€™s employment duties.Â  The record also contains substantial evidence that the unusual and extraordinary exertion caused Robertâ€™s heart attack by aggravating a preexisting heart condition.Â  Accordingly, Faye met the burden of proof required for a heart attack to be compensable. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the forgoing, we find the Commissionâ€™s findings of fact were supported by substantial evidence and that Faye met her burden of proving her husbandâ€™s heart attack was compensable.Â  Accordingly, the order of the circuit court affirming the award of benefits is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., AND HUFF AND BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
