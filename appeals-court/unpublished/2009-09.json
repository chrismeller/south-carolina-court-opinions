Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 307, 486\r\n  S.E.2d 750, 759 (1997).&nbsp; Additionally, courts, by exercising their\r\n  contempt power, can award attorney's fees under a compensatory contempt theory. Harris-Jenkins v. Nissan Car Mart, Inc., 348 S.C. 171, 178, 557 S.E.2d\r\n  708, 711-12&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001).&nbsp; Compensatory contempt seeks to\r\n  reimburse the party for the costs it incurs in forcing the non-complying\r\n  party to obey the court's orders.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; \r\nHere, no contract or statute authorized the award of attorney's\r\n  fees.Â  Additionally, no previous court order required Personal Representative\r\n  to return Deumling's property, and therefore the probate court could not hold\r\n  Personal Representative in contempt.Â  As a result, the circuit court erred in affirming the probate\r\n  court's award of attorney's fees.Â  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., KONDUROS and LOCKEMY, JJ, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-415","title":"State v.

Gambrell, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tWilliam Hood, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Hazel Skelton Smith appeals the\r\n  family court's finding she failed to prove by the preponderance of the evidence\r\n  that she and J.C. Smith, Jr.\r\n  (Decedent), her deceased former husband, shared a common-law\r\n  marriage after their divorce. Â She maintains the couple's continued\r\n  cohabitation, their purchase of adjoining burial plots, Decedent's leaving a\r\n  life estate in his home to her, their sharing of household chores, and the\r\n  community's recognition of their relationship were evidence of common-law\r\n  marriage.Â  She also contends she is prejudiced by the failure of a\r\n  substantial portion of her transcript to be transcribed.Â  We affirm[1] pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities: \r\n1. As to whether the family\r\n  court erred in finding Smith failed to establish a marital relationship by the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence: Richland Mem'l Hosp. v. English, 295\r\n  S.C. 511, 513, 369 S.E.2d 395, 396 (Ct. App. 1988) (stating the determination of the existence of a\r\n  common-law marriage is a matter of law); Pittman v. Lowther, 363 S.C.\r\n  47, 50, 610 S.E.2d 479, 480 (2005) (providing that in law actions tried without\r\n  a jury, the factual findings of the trial court are to be upheld if supported\r\n  by any evidence);Â  Barker v. Baker, 330 S.C. 361, 370, 499 S.E.2d 503,\r\n  508 (Ct. App. 1998) (holding because the existence of a common-law marriage is a question of fact in an action sounding in law, this\r\n  court is bound by the family court's factual findings, particularly credibility\r\n  determinations); Callen v. Callen, 365 S.C. 618, 623, 620 S.E.2d 59, 62 (2005) (&quot;The proponent of the\r\n  alleged marriage has the burden of proving the elements by a preponderance of\r\n  the evidence.&quot;); Johnson v. Johnson, 235 S.C. 542, 550, 112\r\n  S.E.2d 647, 651 (1960) (finding\r\n  an essential element of a common-law marriage is a mutual agreement between the\r\n  parties to assume the relationship of husband and wife); Callen, 365\r\n  S.C. at 624, 620 S.E.2d at 62 (&quot;The fact finder is to look for mutual\r\n  assent: the intent of each party to be married to the other and a mutual\r\n  understanding of each party's intent.&quot;); Barker, 330 S.C. at 368-69, 499 S.E.2d at 507 (&quot;[I]f a party claiming a common-law marriage presents proof of apparent[]\r\n  matrimonial cohabitation and long-term social acceptance of the couple as\r\n  married, a presumption arises that the couple entered into a common-law\r\n  marriage, notwithstanding the absence\r\n  of any proof of an express agreement to enter into a common-law marriage.Â  The\r\n  presumption, however, in no way lessens the claimant's burden of proving a\r\n  common-law marriage by the preponderance of the evidence. . . . Instead, the\r\n  presumption simply designates the facts that, if proven to the satisfaction of\r\n  the fact-finder, will be sufficient to establish a common-law marriage unless properly rebutted.&quot;); id. at 370, 499\r\n  S.E.2d at 508 (&quot;The probate court's conclusion that [alleged husband]\r\n  failed to prove the existence of a common-law marriage is inextricably intertwined with the\r\n  court's determination of the credibility of the witnesses.Â  For this [c]ourt to\r\n  determine that [he] in fact established long-term social acceptance of [alleged\r\n  wife] and him as married would require us to reject the probate court's\r\n  credibility findings, an action we cannot take in this case.&quot;). \r\n2.Â  As to whether Smith is prejudiced by the failure of a portion of her\r\n  transcript to be transcribed: State v. Ladson, 373 S.C. 320, 325, 644 S.E.2d 271, 274&nbsp;(Ct. App.\r\n  2007) (holding a new trial is appropriate if an appellant establishes the\r\n  incomplete nature of the transcript prevents the appellate court from conducting\r\n  a meaningful appellate review); id. at 324-25, 644 S.E.2d at 273 (&quot;Most\r\n  jurisdictions require an appellant to demonstrate specific prejudice flowing\r\n  from an incomplete or reconstructed record. . . . We believe our supreme court\r\n  would follow a rule requiring the party challenging a reconstructed record on\r\n  appeal to demonstrate prejudice flowing from an inadequate record.&quot;); Sweat\r\n    v. Crawford, 292 S.C. 324, 327, 356 S.E.2d 147, 149&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1987) (finding\r\n  omissions from the record did not prejudice appellant because the evidence included\r\n  in the record sufficiently supported the findings of fact made by the referee\r\n  and concurred in by the circuit court). \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and THOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-429","title":"State v.

Based\r\n  on the supreme court's recent opinion in State v. Wallace, we affirm the\r\n  circuit court's admission of prior bad acts evidence under Rule 404(b).Â  Op.\r\n  No. 26703 (S.C. Sup. Ct. Aug. 17, 2009) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 37 at 18) (stating\r\n  a close degree of factual similarity between the alleged bad acts and crime\r\n  charged is sufficient to admit the evidence under the common scheme or plan\r\n  exception to the general rule under Rule 404(b) and State v. Lyle, 125\r\n  S.C. 406, 11 S.E. 803 (1923)).Â  We find the allegations against Thomas were\r\n  proven by clear and convincing evidence, and that the evidence is relevant.Â  See State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001); see also Rule\r\n  401, SCRE.Â  Additionally, we find the non-exhaustive list of factors to\r\n  consider in determining whether there is a close degree of similarity between\r\n  the bad act and the crime charged leads to our affirmance of the circuit court.\r\n  Â Wallace, (Shearouse Adv. Sh.

Â Furthermore, we find\r\n  the probative value of victim's testimony substantially outweighs the danger of\r\n  unfair prejudice.Â  See Rule 403, SCRE.\r\n 2.Â  We\r\n  find any violation of the chain of custody requirement in the admission of the\r\n  DNA evidence to be irrelevant and harmless to the outcome of the verdict, as\r\n  Thomas himself testified that he had consensual sex with the victim in the\r\n  vicinity of the items which produced the DNA.

Â We additionally\r\n  find any error in the admission of the investigative report to be harmless as\r\n  cumulative to the photographs and testimony otherwise admitted without\r\n  objection.

Considerations include the importance of the\r\n  witness's testimony, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or\r\n  absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness\r\n  on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and\r\n  the overall strength of the prosecution's case.&quot;); State v.
