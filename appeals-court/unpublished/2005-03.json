Lloyd, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-140Â Â Â \r\nSubmitted February 1, 2005 â€“ Filed March 1, 2005 \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nWilliam Gary White, III of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nMark W. Bakker, J. Theodore Gentry and Alice W.W. Parham, all of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â John Youngblood appeals the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of Qualserve Corporation on his breach of employment contract action.Â  We affirm.1\r\nFACTS\r\nQualserve Corporation2 employed John Youngblood as a warehouse supervisor.Â  Youngblood did not have a written employment contract with Qualserve.Â  In early 2000, Qualserve published an employee manual.Â  \r\nOn May 9, 2002, Qualserve terminated Youngblood from his position as warehouse supervisor for failure to follow company procedures.Â  Youngblood then instituted this action, claiming the employee manual created a contract of employment.Â  Qualserve filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the evidence and the inferences which can be drawn therefrom should be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).Â  Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Baughman v. Am. Tel. and Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 114-15, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545 (1991).Â  Where a verdict is not â€œreasonably possible under the facts presented, summary judgment is proper.â€Â  Bloom v. Ravoira, 339 S.C. 417, 425, 529 S.E.2d 710, 714 (2000).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nYoungblood argues the trial court erred in granting Qualserveâ€™s motion for summary judgment because the language in the employee manual transformed his at-will employment to a contractual employment relationship.Â  We disagree. \r\nSouth Carolina recognizes the doctrine of employment at-will.Â  Prescott v. Farmers Tel. Coop., Inc., 335 S.C. 330, 334, 516 S.E.2d 923, 925 (1999).Â  â€œAt-will employment is generally terminable by either party at any time, for any reason or no reason at all.â€Â  Id.Â  Although some exceptions have been recognized, the doctrine of employment at-will remains in South Carolina as a longstanding economic incentive that provides the marketplace its necessary flexibility.Â  Id. at 335, 516 S.E.2d at 925.Â  \r\nNevertheless, â€œan employer and employee may contractually alter the general rule of employment at-will, thereby restricting the freedom of either party to terminate the employment relationship without incurring liability.â€Â  Baril v. Aiken Regional Med. Ctr., 352 S.C. 271, 281, 573 S.E.2d 830, 836 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  An employee handbook may create such a contract.Â  Small v. Springs, 292 S.C. 481, 485, 357 S.E.2d 452, 455 (1987).Â  The court in Small explained, â€œIt is patently unjust to allow an employer to couch a handbook, bulletin, or other similar material in mandatory terms and then allow him to ignore these very policies as â€˜a gratuitous, nonbinding statement of general policyâ€™ whenever it works to his disadvantage.â€ Id.  \r\nAlthough the Small court instructed that an employer may continue at-will employment by inserting a conspicuous disclaimer into the handbook, the supreme court subsequently ruled a disclaimer is merely one factor to consider in ascertaining whether the handbook as a whole conveys credible promises that should be enforced.Â  Id.; Fleming v. Borden, 316 S.C. 452, 463, 450 S.E.2d 589, 596 (1994).Â  The entire handbook, including any disclaimer, should be considered in determining whether the handbook gives rise â€œto a promise, an expectation and a benefit.â€Â  Fleming, 316 S.C. at 463, 450 S.E.2d at 596.Â  â€œAn employee manual that contains promissory language and a disclaimer is â€˜inherently ambiguousâ€™ and a jury should interpret whether the manual creates or alters an existing contractual relationship.â€Â  Horton v. Darby Elec. Co.,360 S.C. 58, 67, 599 S.E.2d 456, 460 (2004).Â  \r\nThe first page of the employee manual contained the following language written in bold capital letters:\r\n\r\nThe contents of this handbook do not constitute the terms of an employment contract, express or implied, between Food Service Supplies, Inc. (FSSI) and the employee.Â  The contents of this employee handbook are not all inclusive in that they summarize current company policies and procedures and are intended as guidelines Only.Â  the company retains the right to change, modify, suspend, interpret or cancel in whole or in part any of the published or unpublished policies or practices of the company, without advance notice, in its sole discretion, and without Having to give cause or justification to any employee.Â  \r\nNothing contained in this handbook should be construed as a guarantee of continued employment, but rather, employment with the company is on an at-will basis.Â  This means that the employment relationship may be terminated at any time by either the employee or the company for any reason not expressly prohibited by law, or for no reason.\r\nAny written or oral statements by a supervisor, corporate officer or other agent of the company that is contrary to the foregoing, or that purports to change, add to, or delete anything in this handbook is invalid and should not be relied upon by any prospective or existing employee unless such a statement and/or agreement is in writing and signed by the president of FSSI.\r\n\r\nThe Qualserve disclaimer is written in bold, highlighted in all capital letters, and contained in its entirety on the first page of the employee manual provided to Youngblood.Â  Moreover, Youngblood does not argue the employee manual lacks a disclaimer.Â  Therefore, the issue to resolve is whether other provisions in the employee manual give rise to â€œa promise, an expectation, and a benefitâ€ upon which Youngblood relied and which altered his at-will status.Â  \r\nYoungblood argues the provisions of the manual, specifically the disciplinary policy contained therein, create sufficient mandatory and promissory language to alter his at-will employment status to a contractual relationship.Â  Specifically, Youngblood alleges the disciplinary policy contained promises of a progressive disciplinary policy and Qualserve failed to provide him the required warnings before terminating his employment.Â  \r\n\r\nThe disciplinary policy provides, in part:\r\n  \r\nThe Companyâ€™s normal practice is to help the employee identify problems and to improve performance and behavior.Â  The specific disciplinary action will normally be based on an assessment of the offense, the circumstances, and previous record.Â  The company reserves the right to take whatever disciplinary measures it feels are appropriate, including discharge, if in the judgment of management the employeeâ€™s conduct and/or performance cannot be corrected or it seriously threatens the well being of the Company or other employees, or if other circumstances indicate that termination is appropriate.\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe manual lists examples of offenses for which an employee will be disciplined, but notes behavior subject to discipline is not limited to the listed acts.Â  The manual details a progressive discipline procedure that may be used.Â  However, it cautions:Â  \r\n\r\nThe decision of whether to use progressive discipline and what type of discipline to use will be based on the judgment of management. . . .Â  Some types of conduct or performance may result in immediate termination of employment with no prior discipline. . . .\r\nAny employee who believes they have been treated unfairly with respect to discipline, counseling, or termination of employment should pursue a complaint under the Problem Resolution Plan in the handbook.\r\nEmployment with FSSI is at the mutual consent of FSSI and the employee, and either party may terminate that relationship at any time, with or without cause, and with or without advance notice.\r\n\r\nIn Conner v. City of Forest Acres, the South Carolina Supreme Court found that an employee manual containing mandatory or promissory language in a disciplinary policy provision may create a contractual employment relationship.Â  348 S.C. 454, 464, 560 S.E.2d 606, 611 (2002).Â  Examples of mandatory language from Conner include:Â  â€œ(1) violations of the Code of Conduct â€˜will be disciplined,â€™ (2) â€˜discipline shall be of an increasingly progressive nature,â€™ and (3) â€˜all employees shall be treated fairly and consistently in all matters related to their employment.â€™â€Â  Conner, 348 S.C. at 464 n.4, 560 S.E.2d at 611 n.4.Â  \r\nIn contrast, the supreme court recently held an employerâ€™s manual exemplified â€œthe appropriate manner in which to give employees a guide regarding their employment without altering the at-will employment relationship.â€Â  Horton, 360 S.C. at 67, 599 S.E.2d at 460.Â  The court found the manual contained conspicuous disclaimers, which the employee understood.Â  Id. at 67, 599 S.E.2d at 460-61.Â  It further found the disciplinary procedures contained permissive language and did not provide for mandatory progressive discipline.3Â  Id.\r\nÂ at 67, 599 S.E.2d at 461.\r\nUnlike the manual in Conner, Qualserveâ€™s employee manual contained no mandatory or promissory language in the disciplinary policy.Â  To the contrary, the disciplinary policy clearly contains disclaimers and is couched in permissive language, as was the manual in Horton.Â  This language clearly notified the employee that the disciplinary provisions did not create a mandatory progressive discipline policy.Â  Rather the disciplinary provisions only created a scheme of discretionary discipline available to the company.Â  \r\nFurthermore, Youngbloodâ€™s own testimony demonstrates his understanding that the disciplinary policy allowed Qualserve the discretion to terminate or discipline its at-will employees:\r\n\r\nQ: So the company retained the discretion to discipline or terminate in its own discretion, is that correct?\r\nA: Say that again.\r\nQ: The company retained the right to terminate or discipline employees in its own discretion?\r\nA: Through that book [the employee manual], yes, they did.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we hold no reasonable jury could find the disciplinary policy created â€œa promise, an expectation and a benefitâ€ that would alter Youngboodâ€™s at-will employment.Â  \r\nYoungblood also asserts other sections of the employee manual are â€œreplete with mandatory and representative language.â€Â  He lists 34 page numbers that he asserts contain mandatory language.Â  However, he fails to argue how any of these provisions contain promissory language that would alter the at-will nature of his employment. Â \r\nYoungblood next argues a memorandum from Human Resources Director Jennifer Gutierrez reinforced his interpretation of the employee manual that the progressive discipline policy was mandatory.Â  In this memorandum, Gutierrez instructed:\r\n\r\nIn order to ensure we consistently apply corporate policies and procedures, and comply with all federal and state legal requirements I will need to be notified of all situations which may ultimately require termination prior to any actual terminations take place.Â  If this is an employee whom you feel is not contributing to your team, proper steps must be taken in advance in order to protect yourself and the company.Â  Under no circumstances should an employee be terminated â€œon the spotâ€ with out any prior discussions with myself.Â  You should always allow a â€œcooling offâ€ period to ensure proper handling of an issue.Â  \r\n\r\nYoungblood acknowledged that this memorandum was not disseminated to rank-and-file employees but only to supervisors.Â  He also admitted that its purpose was for protecting the company rather than giving legal rights to the employees.Â  We find nothing in the memorandum could be interpreted as â€œa promise, an expectation and a benefitâ€ that would alter the at-will nature of Youngbloodâ€™s employment.Â  The memorandum simply directed Youngblood and other supervisors to contact the Human Resources department before terminating an employee.Â  It in no way limited Qualserveâ€™s authority to terminate employees.Â  \r\nYoungblood also argues the oral representations of Melanie Mead, a member of Qualserveâ€™s human resources staff, created sufficient mandatory and promissory language to alter his at-will employment status to a contractual relationship.Â  Youngblood alleges Meadâ€™s oral representations contained promises of a progressive disciplinary policy and Qualserve failed to provide him the required warnings before terminating his employment.Â  Youngblood testified that when Mead distributed the employee manuals, she explained the disciplinary policy to him.Â  He acknowledged that her explanation was reflected in the employee manual.Â  Youngblood also testified that as a supervisor, he followed the progressive discipline guidelines at Meadâ€™s instruction.Â  He stated she told him to follow the guidelines â€œto help the company as far as legal suitsâ€ and instructed him to take no action against employees without consulting her.\r\nEven when viewing Youngbloodâ€™s testimony in the light most favorable to him, we find it does not create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether his status as an at-will employee was altered.Â  He admitted Meadâ€™s explanations were reflected in the employee manual, which as stated above, contained clear disclaimers and was couched in permissive language.Â  He did not testify that Mead instructed him to ignore those disclaimers.Â  Youngblood stated that as Mead explained to him, the disclaimers were in effect to allow for immediate termination of employees who committed serious violations of company policy, such as carrying a weapon on the job site or selling drugs on the job site.Â  He claimed the disclaimers should not apply to him as â€œa 21 year employee thatâ€™s done an outstanding job.â€Â  However, he subsequently acknowledged that the disclaimer applied to â€œall employees.â€Â  \r\nIn addition, the disclaimer on page one of the employee manual establishes that an employee cannot rely on any type of oral representation received from a supervisor, corporate officer, or other agent of the corporation.Â  Youngblood acknowledged the disclaimer contained this language.Â  By the terms of the employee manual, Youngblood was warned against relying on conversations he had with Mead that purported to alter his at-will status.Â  Therefore, the oral representations of Mead do not create a material issue of fact to be resolved by the jury.Â  \r\nFinally, Youngblood refers to the handbookâ€™s problem resolution plan.Â  Although in his brief he claims the plan was not made available to him, he admitted in his deposition that he never pursued the problem resolution plan.Â  Accordingly, we find Youngblood cannot rely on this provision in his action for breach of contract.Â  \r\nYoungblood also asserts his termination breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.Â  As we find Youngblood has failed to establish the existence of a contract of employment altering his at-will status, his claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing must also fail.Â  See Keiger v. Citgo, Coastal Petroleum, 326 S.C. 369, 374, 482 S.E.2d 792, 794 (Ct. App. 1997) (finding where plaintiff failed to allege that her at-will employment status was altered by a handbook or other agreement, her claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing must fail).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL,\r\nJJ., concur.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n2 Qualserve Corporation was formerly known as Food Service Supplies, Inc. and is referred to by that name throughout the employee manual.\r\n3 The supreme court listed as examples of the permissive language used:Â  \r\n\r\n(1) the disciplinary procedure â€œis to be viewed as the guiding policy insofar as taking disciplinary action . . .;â€ (2) â€œsupervisors are not required to go through the entire three steps involved in the disciplinary procedure;â€ (3) â€œ[d]iscipline may begin at any step in the procedure depending on the seriousness of the offense committed;â€ and (4) â€œsupervisor may repeat any of the first two steps of this procedure when he feels it is necessary, so long as the discipline is commensurate with the offense committed.â€\r\n\r\nHorton, 360 S.C. at 67 n.7, 599 S.E.2d at 461 n.7 (emphasis in Horton opinion).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-141","title":"Byrd v.

Byrd, pro se, of Spartanburg.\r\nFletcher N. Smith, Jr., of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this domestic action, Delores B. Byrd, the wife, appeals a family court order denying her motion to restore the case to the active docket.Â  We reverse and remand.[1]\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe parties divorced in 1994.Â  Among other things, the divorce decree required James Byrd, the husband, to pay alimony to the wife in the amount of $115 per week, with the proviso that he could petition for a reduction in alimony if the wife returned to work or received an award of disability through a then-pending claim.Â  The family court also ordered that the marital residence be sold and allowed the wife to remain in the home until the time of the sale.\r\nIn 1997, the husband filed a new action in the case in which he requested a temporary hearing to address several issues, including the sale of the marital home and termination of spousal support.Â  Pursuant to this request, the family court held a hearing on August 12, 1997, and issued a temporary order finding the wife was receiving social security disability benefits and terminating further alimony payments from the husband to the wife.Â  The family court also ordered the marital home to â€œbe placed immediately up for sale by a reputable real estate concern.â€Â  Neither party requested a final hearing in the case, prompting the family court to issue an administrative order striking the case from the docket with leave to restore for good cause.Â  No motion to restore was ever made until 2002.Â  \r\nThe marital home was finally sold in December 2001.Â  In February 2002, the wife filed her own action in which she requested reinstatement of alimony based on the financial circumstances of the parties, reimbursement of one half of the costs she incurred in preparing the marital home for sale, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The husband answered and counterclaimed on April 15, 2002. \r\nThe family court held a hearing in the wifeâ€™s action on September 12, 2002.Â  On October 16, 2002, the family court filed a final order in the case dismissing with prejudice both the wifeâ€™s complaint and the husbandâ€™s counterclaim.Â  In declining to rule on the issue of alimony, the family court found â€œthat neither party filed a timely motion to restore [the 1997 action] and as such the issue of alimony is barred from further consideration by this Court and thus the issue of alimony is not a proper issue[ ] before this Court.â€Â  In the same order, the family court found that, although the wife had expended money in preparing for the sale of the marital home, any reimbursement to which she was entitled was offset by her refusal to obey certain provisions in the divorce decree concerning the impending sale and the fact that she had beneficial use of the home for the seven years preceding the sale.Â  \r\nAfter the final hearing in the 2002 proceeding but before the filing of the final order, the wife petitioned to restore the 1997 case to the docket and have a hearing set on the issue of alimony.Â  In her petition, the wife alleged the sale of the marital home in 2001 amounted to a substantial change in circumstances entitling her to alimony.Â  As additional support for her claim, she also alleged the husbandâ€™s income had increased from $1,880 to $3,077 per month.Â  As evidence of good cause to restore the case, the record also included a proposed order to restore prepared and signed by the wifeâ€™s attorney.Â  This proposed order stated (1) alimony was terminated on a temporary basis, (2) a final merits hearing was never held in the matter, (3) the wife was informed that the marital home had to be sold before a final hearing could take place, and (4) the parties only recently closed on the sale of the marital home.\r\nOn November 4, 2002, the family court held a hearing on the wifeâ€™s motion to restore the 1997 action.Â  By order dated November 25, 2002, the family court issued an order denying the motion.Â  It is from this order that the wife appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nâ€œWhenever a domestic relations . . . case has been filed and entered in the File Book for more than two hundred seventy (270) days without having been continued, tried or otherwise disposed of, the clerk of court shall strike the case from the File Book with leave to restore.â€[2]Â  â€œAny case stricken from the File Book . . . shall be restored only upon the written order of the Chief Administrative Judge, obtained after written application is made and good cause shown why the case should be continued as a pending case . . . .â€[3]\r\n\r\nThe family court explained its refusal to restore the case as follows:Â  \r\nThe case was initially filed five and a half years ago, . . . and was stricken from the active docket almost five years ago.Â  Both parties simply allowed the case to die from inaction.Â  It would be unjust to revive it after such an extended period of lack of prosecution. \r\n\r\nIn our view, the family court placed unwarranted emphasis on the amount of time that had elapsed between the striking of the case and the wifeâ€™s attempt to have it restored to the docket.Â  When the supreme court ordered that lawsuits pending in the family courts more than two hundred seventy days without a final hearing or other disposition be struck from the docket, it required only a showing of â€œgood causeâ€ in a written application to have a case restored as a pending matter.[4]Â  No mention is made as to how much time a litigant has to request this relief, let alone that an extended lapse of time before moving to restore, without more, is tantamount to a lack of good cause.Â  Moreover, the family court made no specific findings as to why it would be â€œunjustâ€ to hold a hearing on the merits.Â  We therefore hold the family courtâ€™s refusal to restore the 1997 case to the docket under these circumstances amounted to an error of law.[5]\r\nWe further disagree with the husbandâ€™s argument that the wifeâ€™s appeal must fail because she did not appeal the family courtâ€™s dismissal of her 2002 action.Â  It appears from the order dismissing that case and comments from the wifeâ€™s counsel that the family court indicated it would rule on the wifeâ€™s request to have her alimony reinstated when a motion to restore the prior action was made.Â  As such, contrary to what the husband argued in his brief, we hold the order dismissing the wifeâ€™s 2002 lawsuit was not a final judgment on the merits of her alimony claim and therefore should not bar her from pursuing on appeal her right to a hearing on this issue.\r\nFinally, we hold that the wife has demonstrated good cause to support her petition to have the case restored to the docket.Â  It appears the wife was informed that no final hearing in the matter could be held until the marital home was sold.Â  As noted in her petition, this event did not occur until late 2001, thus accounting for all but less than ten months of the extended delay before the filing of the petition.Â  Because it appears the cessation of alimony payments at the temporary hearing was not intended to be a final adjudication of the wifeâ€™s entitlement to future support, we hold it would be manifestly unjust to prevent a final hearing on this issue.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe therefore reverse the order denying the wifeâ€™s petition to restore the 1997 action and remand the case to the family court for a final hearing in the matter.\r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument

Code of Laws, 1976, as amended.Â  \r\n\r\nBellamy was tried before a jury on these charges.Â  At trial, the State presented testimony of Bushner, Newton, and Matthew Williams.Â  Williams, who was Newtonâ€™s fiancÃ©, was present at the time of the alleged robbery and murder.Â  Bushner and Newton testified to the events that occurred on the night in question upon returning to Williamsâ€™ home after a trip to a convenience store.Â  \r\nNewton testified when she attempted to get out of the car one of the men pulled her out and to the ground.Â  â€œ[W]ith a gun to my head, tells me to keep my head down, asking if nobody gives up any money, my brains are getting blown out; and he just asked me if I had money and that time thatâ€™s when Matthew [Williams] and Ricky [Hanson] came outside.â€Â  The prosecutor then asked Newton if anything was stolen from anybody that night, to which she responded, â€œNot to my knowledge.â€Â  Newton stated she recalled three assailants, but only two having guns.Â  \r\nBushner provided testimony similar to Newtonâ€™s and confirmed there were three assailants, but recalled all three having guns.Â  Bushner also testified, â€œNobody talked to me or messed with me at all.â€Â  \r\nWilliams also testified to the presence of three men, all of whom were armed with guns, at his home that night.Â  Williams, however, stated he and Hanson, who was shot and killed during the incident, were told by an assailant, â€œOne of you are going to die tonight if you donâ€™t give us the money.â€Â  Williams testified another assailant said, â€œGive me your jewelry, take your rings off, take your necklace off, give me your money . . . .â€Â  Williams responded by giving the men money and a ring.Â  \r\nAt the close of the Stateâ€™s case, Bellamyâ€™s attorney moved for a directed verdict on both the murder and the armed robbery charges.Â  As to the armed robbery charge, Bellamy argued the case lacked sufficient evidence to go to the jury because none of the witnesses could identify him as one of the assailants.Â  In addition, Bellamyâ€™s attorney asserted the evidence suggested Bellamy was attempting to collect money Hanson owed him, rather than committing a robbery.Â  The trial court denied these motions and submitted the case to the jury.Â  The jury convicted Bellamy of both murder and armed robbery.Â  Bellamy appeals his conviction on the armed robbery charge.[2]  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Bellamy argues the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to try him on the armed robbery charge.Â  We disagree. \r\n&nbsp;Issues involving the subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time.[3]Â  â€œA circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction if:Â  (1) there has been an indictment, which sufficiently states the offense; (2) there has been a waiver of indictment; or (3) the charge is a lesser included charge of the crime charged in the indictment.â€[4]Â  â€œAn indictment is sufficient to convey jurisdiction if it apprises the defendant of the elements of the offense intended to be charged and informs the defendant of the circumstances he must be prepared to defend.â€[5]\r\n&nbsp;The supreme court has defined robbery as â€œthe felonious or unlawful taking of money, goods, or other personal property of any value from the person of another or in his presence by violence or by putting such person in fear.â€[6]Â  â€œArmed robbery occurs when a person commits robbery while armed with a deadly weapon.â€[7]\r\n&nbsp;We hold the indictment is sufficient on its face to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the trial court to try Bellamy for the offense of armed robbery.Â  It contains all the required elements of an armed robbery offense and sufficiently places Bellamy on notice that he was to be tried on the offense of armed robbery against Hanson, Newton, and Bushner.[8]  \r\n&nbsp;Although Bellamy frames his issue on appeal as that of lack of subject matter jurisdiction by the trial court, he argues a material variance existed between the allegations in the indictment for armed robbery and the proof provided at trial.Â  Specifically, he contends the State did not provide sufficient proof to convict him of the armed robbery of Hanson, Newton, and Bushner.Â  Rather, the only evidence of armed robbery provided at trial supports the armed robbery of Williams, who was not included in the indictment.Â  We hold this argument does not address Bellamyâ€™s contention that subject matter jurisdiction was lacking; therefore, it is not properly preserved for our review.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n&nbsp;â€œA material variance between the charge and the proof entitles the defendant to a directed verdict.â€[9]Â  Although Bellamy moved for a directed verdict, his motion did not include the argument that a material variance existed between the indictment and the evidence presented by the State.Â  Issues not raised to the trial court in support of a directed verdict motion are not preserved for appellate review.[10]Â  We therefore cannot address this issue on appeal. \r\n&nbsp; AFFIRMED. \r\n&nbsp; GOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), Bellamyâ€™s appellate counsel filed an appeal and a petition to be relieved as counsel, arguing the trial court failed to instruct the jury on the law of accident.Â  Bellamy also submitted a pro se brief.Â  This court denied counselâ€™s petition to be relieved and ordered the parties to brief the issue of whether a material variance existed between the allegations of Bellamyâ€™s armed robbery indictment and the proof at trial, thus defeating subject matter jurisdiction.Â  The rebriefing order noted this issue was the only point of arguable merit in Bellamyâ€™s appeal.\r\n[3]Â  Mathis v.

Barber, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-143\r\nSubmitted February 1, 2005 â€“ Filed March 1, 2005Â Â Â \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nMarie Therese Assaad-Faltas, of Columbia, pro se, for Appellant. \r\nDana M. Thye, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Marie Therese Assaad-Faltas appeals from her conviction in municipal court for shoplifting.Â  The circuit court, in its appellate capacity, affirmed.Â  We now affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nFaltas was arrested after two Wal-Mart employees witnessed her swap the labels of two less expensive folders for two more expensive binders.Â  The arrest warrant charged her with shoplifting less than $1000 worth of merchandise in violation of section 16-13-110 of the South Carolina Code (2003).\r\nAt trial, E.J. Lipscomb, an employee of Wal-Mart, testified he witnessed Faltas exchange the labels on the binders for other labels.Â  He testified that she then attempted to purchase the binders with the different labels.Â  Faltas was subsequently stopped and questioned by Lipscomb and another employee, Frederick Stevens.Â  \r\nLipscomb identified a Polaroid photograph taken the date of the incident and testified it properly depicted the binders and folders that Faltas attempted to purchase with swapped labels. Finally, he testified the actual binders were returned to the store shelves and the labels, which were removed, were not kept.Â  \r\nStevens also testified regarding the incident.Â  He observed Faltas removing the labels from binders and from colored folders.Â  Stevens confirmed with the cashier that Faltas purchased binders, not folders.Â  Faltas was stopped and had only the clear binders in her possession.Â  \r\nFaltas fired her counsel midway through trial.Â  After being appropriately warned of the dangers of self-representation by the trial court, Faltas was allowed to proceed at trial pro se.Â  She was allowed to recall several of the Cityâ€™s witnesses to reexamine them.Â  \r\nFaltas testified that she neither shoplifted nor had the intent to shoplift.Â  She explained she switched the labels to correct an initial mislabeling by Wal-Mart.Â Â  Faltas asserted that she purchased binders at the appropriate price.Â  Finally, Faltas challenged the Polaroid photograph and indicated the binders and folders depicted were not those she attempted to purchase, nor were they the ones on which she tried to correct the labels.Â  \r\nFaltas was convicted of shoplifting and fined $500.Â  The circuit court affirmed her conviction and sentence.Â  The court subsequently denied her Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion and a motion to â€œperpetuate testimony.â€Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn criminal appeals from magistrate or municipal court, the circuit court does not conduct a de novo review, but instead reviews for preserved error raised to it by appropriate exception.Â  In reviewing criminal cases, this court may review errors of law only.â€Â  State v. Henderson, 347 S.C. 455, 457, 556 S.E.2d 691, 692 (Ct. App. 2001) (internal citations omitted); see also, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-25-105 (Supp. 2004) (â€œThere shall be no trial de novo on any appeal from a municipal courtâ€).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nFaltas raises a multitude of issues related to the conduct and outcome of her trial in municipal court.Â  The issues will be considered as they are presented in Faltasâ€™s Statement of Issues on Appeal in her brief.\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Motion to Dismiss\r\nFaltas alleges the municipal court erred in failing to dismiss her case.Â  She claims the warrant failed to state a crime and did not provide her adequate notice; the evidence was not properly maintained and presented at trial; and the City â€œaggravated the unfairness by inexcusably refusing to show the Defense any remaining evidence until the morning of trial.â€Â  \r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Warrant\r\nFaltas contends the warrant â€œfailed to state a crime and did not give Appellant notice of the charges against her.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nFirst, this issue was not sufficiently raised to the trial court.Â  As such, it is not preserved for review on appeal.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).Â  \r\nHowever, as the arrest warrant serves the function of an indictment in magistrate and municipal courts, the sufficiency of the indictment may impact the subject matter jurisdiction of the court.Â  Faltasâ€™s argument also fails on the merits.Â  â€œAll proceedings before magistrates in criminal cases shall be commenced on information under oath, plainly and substantially setting forth the offense charged, upon which, and only which, shall a warrant of arrest issue.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 22-3-710 (Supp. 2004).Â  This section requires the offense with which a party is charged should be set forth â€œplainly and substantially,â€ so as to enable the party accused to understand the nature of the offense charged, in order that the party may be prepared to meet the charge at the proper time.Â  See State v. Randolph, 239 S.C. 79, 84, 121 S.E.2d 349, 351 (1961).Â Â  \r\nThe affidavit as part of the arrest warrant clearly sets forth the location of the crime and the facts underlying the crime.Â  It explains Faltas was observed â€œswapping price tags on merchandise for tags that were less expensive.â€Â  The arrest warrant then lists the offense and the applicable section of the South Carolina Code:Â  â€œShoplifting under $1000Â  16-13-110.â€Â  Accordingly, we find Faltas was properly advised of the nature of the offense for which she has been charged.\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Preservation of Evidence\r\nFaltasâ€™s main contention throughout her brief appears to be the failure of either Wal-Mart or the City to maintain the actual folders and labels she allegedly shoplifted.Â  She asserts that because they failed to present the actual folders at trial, the charges should have been dismissed.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn State v. Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. 526, 538-39, 552 S.E.2d 300, 307 (2001), the South Carolina Supreme Court explained:\r\n\r\nThe State does not have an absolute duty to preserve potentially useful evidence that might exonerate a defendant.Â  Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281 (1988); State v. Mabe, 306 S.C. 355, 412 S.E.2d 386 (1991); State v. Jackson, 302 S.C. 313, 396 S.E.2d 101 (1990).Â  To establish a due process violation, a defendant must demonstrate (1) that the State destroyed the evidence in bad faith, or (2) that the evidence possessed an exculpatory value apparent before the evidence was destroyed and the defendant cannot obtain other evidence of comparable value by other means.Â  State v. Mabe, supra; State v. Jackson, supra.\r\n\r\nIn both Cheeseboro and Mabe, evidence was destroyed without bad faith and the appellant in each case was unable to prove the evidence had exculpatory value.Â  In Jackson, however, the evidence was found to be material and the destruction was done even though the State knew the evidence was material.Â  The court concluded:Â  â€œIn the case at bar, the videotape was clearly â€˜materialâ€™.Â  The exculpatory value was apparent before its destruction because one assistant solicitor was willing to drop the charges because of it.Â  In addition, Jackson had no other evidence and could not obtain evidence of comparable value.â€Â  Jackson, 302 S.C. at 316, 396 S.E.2d at 102.\r\nIn the instant case, testimony indicated the evidence was returned to Wal-Mart after being photographed, pursuant to Wal-Martâ€™s standard procedure.Â  Witnesses testified the photographs accurately represented the evidence.Â  Faltas has been unable to demonstrate the return of the evidence to Wal-Mart for re-labeling and sale was done in bad faith.Â  Nor has Faltas, in the judgment of the circuit court and this court, explained the exculpatory value of the folders.Â  Finally, Faltas was able to bring like folders and binders to the trial for use in cross-examination and demonstrative purposes.Â  She was not prevented from being able to make her defense by the return of the folders and binders to the general merchandise of the store.Â  We further adopt the reasoning and analysis of the circuit court in its well-reasoned opinion.Â  We join the circuit court in finding that the trial court properly denied Faltasâ€™s motion to dismiss on this ground.\r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â  Refusal to Provide Evidence Ahead of Trial\r\nFaltas contends the trial court erred in allowing the trial to proceed when she was not presented the evidence prior to the date of trial.Â  We disagree.\r\nFaltas attempts to use this issue to expand on her discussion of the previous issue regarding whether the trial court improperly refused to dismiss the case because the actual folders and binders were not maintained.Â  At trial, she did not seek to challenge the authenticity of the photograph when it was entered into evidence.Â  Therefore, her current issue is not preserved for review on appeal as it was not specifically raised to or ruled on by the trial court.Â  See Wilder Corp., 330 S.C. at 76, 497 S.E.2d at 733.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Admission of the Polaroid Photograph\r\nFaltas contends the trial court erred in admitting the photograph â€œover Defense objection because it was not independently corroborated.â€Â  She also maintains it was error for the court to rely on the photograph in finding her guilty of shoplifting.Â  We disagree.\r\nFaltas attempts to use this issue to expand on her discussion of the previous issue regarding whether the trial court improperly refused to dismiss the case because the actual folders and binders were not maintained.Â  At trial, she did not seek to challenge the authenticity of the photograph when it was entered into evidence.Â  She sought to challenge the lack of the physical evidence and the chain of custody.Â  Therefore, her current issue is not preserved for review on appeal as it was not specifically raised to or ruled on by the trial court.Â  See id.\r\nOn the merits, â€œ[t]he admission or exclusion of evidence is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and its ruling will not be disturbed in the absence of a manifest abuse of discretion accompanied by probable prejudice.â€Â  State v. Wise, 359 S.C. 14, 21, 596 S.E.2d 475, 478 (2004).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of the trial court either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of law.â€Â  Id.  \r\nTwo witnesses testified at trial that the photographs properly showed the folders and binders at issue.Â  Both witnesses testified regarding the contents of the photographs and had no difficulty identifying the contents. It was not error for the court to admit the evidence.Â  As to the courtâ€™s reliance on the evidence, that goes to the weight of the evidence and is not reviewable on appeal.Â  See State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001) (â€œIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only. We are bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. . . . This Court does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the â€¦ evidence but simply determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.â€).Â  The decision of the trial court to admit the photograph and any reliance placed on the photograph in making its ultimate determination is affirmed.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Directed\r\nVerdict\r\nFaltas contends the trial court erred in failing to grant her motion for a directed verdict.Â  We disagree.\r\nOn appeal from the denial of a directed verdict in a criminal case, an appellate court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Curtis, 356 S.C. 622, 633, 591 S.E.2d 600, 605 (2004).Â  When ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.Â  State v. Wilds, 355 S.C. 269, 274, 584 S.E.2d 138, 140 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œA defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.â€Â  State v. McKnight, 352 S.C. 635, 642, 576 S.E.2d 168, 171 (2003).\r\n\r\nSection 16-13-110(A)(2) of the South Carolina Code (2003) states:\r\n  \r\n(A) A person is guilty of shoplifting if he:\r\nâ€¦.\r\n(2) alters, transfers, or removes any label, price tag marking, indicia of value, or any other markings which aid in determining value affixed to any merchandise displayed, held, stored, or offered for sale in a store or other retail mercantile establishment and attempts to purchase the merchandise personally or in consort with another at less than the full retail value with the intention of depriving the merchant of the full retail value of the merchandise. . . .\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe directed verdict motion here concerned the failure of the City to provide the court with the actual labels removed from the folders and placed on the binders.Â  Faltas asserted the City failed to provide evidence of her â€œintent to buy an item for less than it was priced.â€Â  Any contentions beyond that specifically raised in the motion to the trial court are not preserved for review on appeal.Â  See State v. Newton, 274 S.C. 287, 293, 262 S.E.2d 906, 910 (1980) (stating matters not passed upon by the trial court will not be reviewed).\r\nTwo Wal-Mart employees testified to observing Faltas switch labels from less expensive items to more expensive ones.Â  The witnessesâ€™ testimony indicated Faltas then purchased the more expensive binders, although she only paid the cost of the less expensive folders.Â  Additionally, a receipt was produced indicating the cost of the items purchased was $0.97, which was the cost of the less expensive folders and not the cost of the binders the witnesses testified Faltas had in her possession when she was stopped.Â  We find there is evidence in the record indicating Faltas swapped the labels with the intent to deprive Wal-Mart of the full value of the merchandise.\r\nIV.Â Â Â  Wal-Mart Manifest and Motion for Continuance\r\nFaltas contends the trial court erred in refusing to grant her a mid-trial continuance in order to obtain a routing manifest in Wal-Martâ€™s possession.Â  Additionally, she argues the court erred in not finding the failure of the City to provide the manifest prior to trial was a violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963).Â  We disagree, and again crave reference to the order of the circuit court.\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Continuance\r\nA trial courtâ€™s denial of a motion for continuance will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion.Â  State v. McMillian, 349 S.C. 17, 21, 561 S.E.2d 602, 604 (2002).Â  During trial, Faltasâ€™s counselâ€”shortly before his discharge by Faltasâ€”began questioning Lipscomb regarding any internal documents or manifest produced by Wal-Mart involving this incident.Â  Lipscomb indicated there was and he believed it was brought to trial.Â  However, the document was not located.Â  Lipscomb testified the manifest contained only information that had already been testified to by Wal-Mart employees.Â  No motion for a continuance was made at the time of the initial testimony regarding the manifest.\r\nFaltas then dismissed her counsel and proceeded pro se.Â  The court properly questioned Faltas regarding her understanding of the dangers of representing herself and instructed her that there would be no continuance on the grounds of her dismissing counsel.Â  After beginning her questioning of Stevens, Faltas moved for a continuance to examine the manifest. Â The trial court denied this motion.Â  This motion was not contemporaneous with the introduction of the testimony regarding the manifest.Â  \r\nFaltasâ€™s counsel, prior to being fired, questioned Lipscomb regarding the manifest and its content.Â  Faltas did not immediately move for a continuance after assuming her representation and was warned no continuances would be granted.Â  As the motion was not contemporaneous with the testimony regarding the manifest and there is no indication the continuance would have provided any additional information, it was not an abuse of discretion for the court to deny the motion.\r\n B.Â Â Â Â Â  Brady Violation\r\nFaltas also appears to argue there was a Brady violation by the City for failing to provide the manifest prior to trial.Â  We disagree.\r\nFirst, it is doubtful this issue was preserved for review.Â  Second, Faltas provides no basis beyond speculation as to the exculpatory value of the document.Â  In any event, the manifest was never in the possession of the City.Â  It was an internal document created by Wal-Mart and was at all times in the possession of Wal-Mart or its employees.Â  See State v. Kennerly, 331 S.C. 442, 452, 503 S.E.2d 214, 220 (Ct. App. 1998) (holding Brady requires the prosecution to disclose evidence that is:Â  1) in its possession; 2) favorable to the accused; and 3) material to guilt or punishment).\r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â  Ineffective Assistance of Counsel and Confrontation of Witnesses\r\nIn her brief, Faltas asserts:Â  â€œDefendants must not be forced to choose only one of her several Sixth Amendment rights.Â  Trial judge had her choose between effective assistance of counsel and effective confrontation of her accusers and effectively deprived her of both.â€Â  \r\nIn her arguments in her brief, she does not seem to raise the effective assistance of counsel argument again.Â  As such, it is deemed abandoned.Â  See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (finding appellant was deemed to have abandoned issue for which he failed to provide any argument or supporting authority).Â  Additionally, there is no claim for ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal.Â  See State v. Felder, 290 S.C. 521, 522, 351 S.E.2d 852, 852 (1986) (holding post-conviction relief, rather than direct appeal, was proper avenue of relief for defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel).\r\nAs to her argument on the trial judgeâ€™s restriction on her confrontation of witnesses, she seems to claim in her brief the limitation was caused by the failure of Wal-Mart and the City to preserve the binders and labels.Â  This issue has been appropriately addressed above. Â \r\nTo the extent that she is critical of the trial judgeâ€™s handling of her examination and cross-examination of witnesses, we find the claim to be without merit.Â  Normally, we will not disturb on appeal a trial courtâ€™s ruling concerning the scope of cross-examination of a witness to test his credibility absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Lynn, 277 S.C. 222, 225, 284 S.E.2d 786, 788 (1981).Â  However, the right to meaningful cross-examination of an adverse witness is included in the defendantâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to confront his accuser.Â  State v. Graham, 314 S.C. 383, 385, 444 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1994).Â  In Delaware v. Van Arsdall, the United States Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause does not prevent:\r\n\r\na trial judge from imposing any limits on defense counselâ€™s inquiry into the potential bias of a prosecution witness.Â  On the contrary, trial judges retain wide latitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, . . . or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.\r\n\r\nDelaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986).\r\nAfter electing to proceed pro se, Faltas was allowed wide latitude in recalling the Cityâ€™s witnesses and in questioning witnesses.Â  The trial court prohibited her from asking repetitive questions and from rehashing all the testimony previously elicited by her counsel.Â  We find no abuse of discretion in the limitations placed upon Faltasâ€™s examination and confrontation of witnesses.\r\nVI.Â Â Â  Reasonable Doubt and Circumstantial Evidence\r\nFaltas contends the trial court applied an incorrect standard in determining whether the City had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Additionally, she maintains the trial court improperly weighed the circumstantial evidence in the case.Â  We disagree.\r\nFirst, it appears the claims may not be preserved for review on appeal.Â  She raises the issues in her brief as what she terms the â€œJudgeâ€™s Instructions to Himself.â€Â  She asserts the trial courtâ€™s statement of her guilt indicates he utilized the incorrect standard.Â  The court stated:Â  â€œI just find Mr. Lipscombâ€™s testimony credible, and then when I go over the physical evidence, I donâ€™t, Iâ€™m not shaken, so I think the evidence is there, and Iâ€™m going to find her guilty.â€Â  However, she failed to preserve any error because she did not raise any objection to the statement or to the application of an allegedly incorrect standard.Â  A contemporaneous objection would be required to raise the issue before the trial court and preserve it for appellate review.Â  State v. Johnson, 324 S.C. 38, 41, 476 S.E.2d 681, 682 (1996).Â  Accordingly, neither claim is preserved for review on appeal.\r\nOn her claim regarding the circumstantial evidence, Faltas additionally did not raise the issue to the circuit court nor obtain a ruling on the issue from the circuit court on appeal.Â  For this additional reason, the specific claim is not preserved for our review.Â  See City of Columbia v. Ervin, 330 S.C. 516, 519-20, 500 S.E.2d 483, 485 (1998) (stating an issue not raised to an intermediate appellate court cannot be considered in a subsequent appeal to the court of appeals or supreme court).\r\nThe circuit court did address the merits of her claim regarding reasonable doubt.Â  This claim also fails on the merits for the reasons expressed in the circuit courtâ€™s order.Â  Pursuant to section 14-25-45 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004), municipal courts have jurisdiction in criminal cases and are explicitly restricted from having jurisdiction in civil cases.Â  The only standard of review utilized by the court is the â€œbeyond a reasonable doubtâ€ standard established for criminal matters.Â  The use of the phrase â€œIâ€™m not shakenâ€ is not evidence the trial court utilized an incorrect standard as Faltas claims.Â  Nothing in the record indicates the judge utilized an incorrect standard or gave himself improper instruction regarding the appropriate standard.Â  We find no error in the judgeâ€™s verdict or the explanation of his verdict.\r\nVII.Â Â  Motion to Supplement Record and Perpetuate Testimony\r\nFaltas contends the trial court erred in failing to allow her to supplement the record with additional evidence, and the circuit court erred in refusing to allow her to perpetuate testimony.Â  \r\nNeither of these contentions appears to be argued in Faltasâ€™s brief.Â  The issues are deemed abandoned.Â  See, e.g., Jinks v. Richland County, 355 S.C. 341, 344, 585 S.E.2d 281, 283 (2003) (holding the court will not consider issues raised on appeal but not argued in the body of the brief); Fields v. Melrose Ltd. Pâ€™ship., 312 S.C. 102, 106, 439 S.E.2d 283, 285 (Ct. App. 1993) (finding issue is deemed abandoned where appellants raise alternative holding in their statement of the issues on appeal, but they fail to argue it in their brief).Â  We reject these contentions as meritless in any event.Â  The circuit court and this court serve only in an appellate capacity in this matter.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe shoplifting conviction of Faltas is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-144","title":"State v.

Ernest Kinard, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-144\r\nHeard December 8, 2004 â€“ Filed March 1, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nChristopher A. Wellborn, of Rock Hill, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Thomas E. Pope, of York; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Harlan Gates appeals his conviction for driving under the influence (DUI), alleging the trial court erred in not suppressing the evidence derived from the checkpoint in which he was stopped.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nGates approached a checkpoint established in the city of York and was asked to stop.Â  While speaking with Gates, Deputy Lonnie Vinesett smelled the odor of alcohol and asked Gates to pull off to the side of the road.Â  Deputy Vinesett asked whether Gates had been drinking and he indicated he had three or four beers.Â  After failing three field sobriety tests, Gates was arrested for DUI.Â  His Datamaster test indicated Gates had a blood alcohol concentration of .10.Â  \r\nAt trial, Gates moved to suppress the results of the stop, arguing it was unconstitutional.Â  York Police Lieutenant Thomas Jenkins testified in camera regarding the checkpointâ€™s establishment, purpose, and procedures.Â  Lt. Jenkins testified there were â€œa number of DUIâ€™s and speeding cases in that particular area,â€ and they established the checkpoint, utilizing officers from several different departments.Â  He testified the checkpoint was established and operated pursuant to York County policies, but each officer was operating under the policy of their particular agency when conducting the stop and any subsequent tests.Â  \r\nThe trial court allowed the evidence into the record, indicating the checkpoint was established for a legitimate purpose, officers stopped all approaching cars, and officers investigated matters typically associated with a traffic checkpoint.Â  Gates was convicted of DUI (second offense) and sentenced to one year imprisonment and a $5,000 fine, suspended to two days in jail and payment of a $1,000 fine with three years probation. Â This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  We are bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  This same standard of review applies to preliminary factual findings in determining the admissibility of certain evidence in criminal cases.â€Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001) (internal citations omitted).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGates contends the checkpoint violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures because: (1) the primary purpose was general crime control; and (2) the officers participating retained more discretion than is allowed.Â  As a result, he maintains the trial court erred in failing to suppress the results of the stop.Â  We disagree.\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Primary Purpose\r\nGates asserts the primary purpose of the checkpoint was general crime control, which violates the Fourth Amendment.Â  We disagree and find the checkpoint was established for a legitimate reason.\r\nThe Fourth Amendment requires searches and seizures be reasonable. A search or seizure is ordinarily unreasonable in the absence of individualized suspicion of wrongdoing.Â  Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 308 (1997).Â  The United States Supreme Court has upheld brief, suspicionless seizures of motorists at a sobriety checkpoint aimed at removing drunk drivers from the road.Â  See Michigan Depâ€™t of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U.S. 444, 455 (1990) (finding the Stateâ€™s interest in preventing drunken driving through sobriety checkpoints at which all drivers are briefly stopped advanced public safety and did not violate motoristsâ€™ Fourth Amendment protections).Â  In Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 663 (1979), the Court found that random, suspicionless stops to check license and registration of drivers violated the Fourth Amendment, but that in certain circumstances, such as where all cars are stopped, it would be permissible.Â  However, the Court in Prouse indicated stops for the purpose of the general interest of crime control would not be valid.Â  Prouse, 440 U.S. at 659 n.18. \r\nIn City of Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32 (2000), the United States Supreme Court was asked to determine whether a checkpoint for the purpose of detecting illegal narcotics violated the Fourth Amendment.Â  The Court found the stop for the detection of illegal narcotics was a search for â€œordinary criminal wrongdoingâ€ and, therefore, did not conform to the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.Â  Edmond, 531 U.S. at 41-42. Â The Court held:Â  \r\n\r\nWe decline to suspend the usual requirement of individualized suspicion where the police seek to employ a checkpoint primarily for the ordinary enterprise of investigating crimes.Â  We cannot sanction stops justified only by the generalized and ever-present possibility that interrogation and inspection may reveal that any given motorist has committed some crime. \r\n\r\nId. at 44.Â  Thus, while brief suspicionless stops of all vehicles and aimed at public safety do not violate the Fourth Amendment, suspicionless stops aimed at trying to catch a motorist committing some general crime are in direct contravention of the Fourth Amendment guarantees.Â  \r\nDuring the in camera hearing in the present case, Lt. Jenkins testified specifically regarding the reasons for the checkpoint and its location.Â  He stated: \r\n\r\nPublic safety.Â  We keep a record of all the DUIâ€™s and all the traffic, you know, among the shifts, that they enter everything into the computer and periodically weâ€™ll go into the computer and see where the most areas where we have a lot of speeding, DUI, reckless driving and that type of stuff and pick out the checkpoints from there.Â  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, he testified:Â  â€œThere was a number of DUIâ€™s and speeding cases in that particular area.â€Â  \r\nGatesâ€™ counsel questioned Lt. Jenkins regarding the purpose of the checkpoints and the following colloquy occurred:\r\n\r\nQ.Â Â Â Â Â  So, road blocks are kind of an important crime control measure, arenâ€™t they?\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Correct.\r\nQ.Â Â Â Â Â  So when youâ€™re setting up these road blocks, when youâ€™re looking at it, the reason youâ€™re setting them up is for crime control, isnâ€™t it?\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Yes sir.\r\nQ.Â Â Â Â Â  I mean, you donâ€™t do it because you donâ€™t have anything else in your life going on; youâ€™re doing it because you want to control crime?\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Right.Â  \r\n\r\nGates asserts the above colloquy indicates the checkpoints were established for unconstitutional reasons.Â  However, Lt. Jenkins had specifically detailed how the site was chosen using the computer statistics regarding DUIâ€™s and speeding in a particular area.Â  Gatesâ€™ counselâ€™s questions were very general, and the responses given by Lt. Jenkins are not in conflict with the prior reasons given for the checkpoints.Â  \r\nProtecting the public, though reducing crime, is a goal of checkpoints established based on the number of DUI and speeding cases in an area.Â  However, the checkpoint, which stopped Gates, was not established for the purpose of finding ordinary criminal wrongdoing or for general crime control.Â  It was established specifically because of the number of DUI and speeding cases in the particular area.Â  \r\nAs in Sitz, the intent of the checkpoint in this case did not violate the Fourth Amendment.Â  Sitz, 496 U.S. at 455 (â€œIn sum, the balance of the Stateâ€™s interest in preventing drunken driving, the extent to which this system can reasonably be said to advance that interest, and the degree of intrusion upon individual motorists who are briefly stopped, weighs in favor of the state program. We therefore hold that it is consistent with the Fourth Amendment.â€).Â  Accordingly, we must look to whether the checkpoint violated the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution because it allowed too much discretion in the stops and tests performed.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Discretion by Officers\r\nGates maintains the checkpoint violated the Fourth Amendment because it allowed the officers to retain too much discretion in the implementation of the stops.Â  We disagree and find the checkpoint was operated pursuant to the procedures approved by the United States Supreme Court.\r\nBecause stopping an automobile and detaining its occupants constitutes a â€œseizure,â€ the Fourth Amendment is implicated in this case, even though the purpose of the stop is limited and the resulting detention quite brief.Â  United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 556-558 (1976).Â  â€œThe essential purpose of the proscriptions in the Fourth Amendment is to impose a standard of â€˜reasonablenessâ€™ upon the exercise of discretion by government officials, including law enforcement agents, in order â€˜to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions.â€™â€Â  Prouse, 440 U.S. at 653-54 (quoting Marshall v. Barlowâ€™s Inc., 436 U.S. 307 (1978)).\r\nIn Prouse, the United States Supreme Court invalidated a discretionary, suspicionless stop for a spot check of a motoristâ€™s driverâ€™s license and vehicle registration.Â  The officerâ€™s conduct in that case was unconstitutional primarily on account of his exercise of â€œstandardless and unconstrained discretion.â€ Prouse, 440 U.S. at 661.Â  The Courtâ€™s primary consideration was that the officers were not stopping all vehicles, but were randomly choosing vehicles to stop and detain.Â  The Court explicated:\r\n\r\nWhen there is not probable cause to believe that a driver is violating any one of the multitude of applicable traffic and equipment regulations--or other articulable basis amounting to reasonable suspicion that the driver is unlicensed or his vehicle unregistered--we cannot conceive of any legitimate basis upon which a patrolman could decide that stopping a particular driver for a spot check would be more productive than stopping any other driver. This kind of standardless and unconstrained discretion is the evil the Court has discerned when in previous cases it has insisted that the discretion of the official in the field be circumscribed, at least to some extent.\r\n\r\nId.Â \r\nThe Court in Prouse was expressly concerned with the extent of the intrusion into the privacy of the driver or other occupants.Â  The Court found there was â€œsubstantial anxietyâ€ created through the use of random stops and the required show of authority to the particular driver.Â  Prouse, 440 U.S. at 657.Â  The Court explained:Â  â€œâ€˜At traffic checkpoints the motorist can see that other vehicles are being stopped, he can see visible signs of the officersâ€™ authority, and he is much less likely to be frightened or annoyed by the intrusion.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting United States v. Oritz, 422 U.S. 891, 894-95 (1975)).Â  The Court then detailed one possible solution was to question â€œall oncoming traffic at roadblock-type stopsâ€ and then, with only brief periods of detainment.Â  Prouse, 440 U.S. at 663.Â  The United States Supreme Court was not as concerned by the actions after the stop as it was the reasons for the stop.Â  \r\nIn the instant case, Lt. Jenkins explicitly testified every vehicle was stopped as it passed though the checkpoint.Â  Whether the officers were under Lt. Jenkinâ€™s command from York County or were from another agency, he announced that the plan established for the checkpoints required every vehicle be detained briefly.Â  He also described the checkpoint in detail; including the fact it was more than a sufficient distance from several possible turn-around locations.Â  The officerâ€™s vehicles were stationary with lights flashing.Â  Finally, officers placed warning signs along the road allowing more than sufficient warning to alert drivers of the upcoming checkpoint.Â  \r\nWhile the questions asked of the drivers may have varied based upon which officer was conducting the stop, Lt. Jenkins testified all stops were â€œreasonably briefâ€ pursuant to the plan established.Â  Additionally, each officer conducted their own tests if they felt a driver might be intoxicated.Â  Deputy Vinesett conducted Gatesâ€™ test and detailed his process.Â  He explained Gatesâ€™ failure of each of the tests.Â  The stop was neither unreasonable, nor left to the â€œunbridled discretionâ€ of the officers as in Prouse.Â  Prouse, 440 U.S. at 663.Â  Neither Sitz, Prouse, nor Edmond require the specific questions or actions performed by the officers after the stop to be pursuant to written guidelines or be in complete concert with one another. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the checkpoint was established for the legitimate purpose of decreasing DUI and speeding in an area specifically targeted because of prior incidents.Â  The checkpoint was operated pursuant to guidelines, which took into consideration all of the concerns expressed by the United States Supreme Court in Prouse and Sitz.Â  The checkpoint did not entail random stops, nor were drivers detained for an unreasonable amount of time.Â  Drivers were warned of the approaching checkpoint and afforded the opportunity to turn around.Â  \r\nWe do not find the differences among the officers as to their questions or specific actions after the stop to be an unreasonable intrusion into the occupantâ€™s privacy.Â  Additionally, we find the officers did not have â€œunbridled discretion,â€ nor did they have â€œstandardless and unconstrained discretionâ€ in making the stops.Â  Accordingly, we find the checkpoint utilized to stop and detain Gates was appropriate and did not violate the Fourth Amendment.Â  Gates conviction and sentence are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-154","title":"Dept. of Health and Human Service v.

Townsend, of Orangeburg, for Appellant.\r\n        George R. Burnett, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The probate court appointed Moses Miller as the personal representative for the estate of his mother, Genobia Washington.Â  The South Carolina Department of Heath and Human Services (DHHS) filed a rule to show cause for Millerâ€™s failure to pay a claim filed by DHHS against Washingtonâ€™s estate.Â  After two hearings on the matter, the probate court issued an order finding DHHSâ€™s claim valid and ordering the estate to pay DHHS.Â  Miller appealed the probate courtâ€™s order to the circuit court, which affirmed the probate courtâ€™s order.Â  We also affirm.1 \r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nBefore her death, Genobia Washington brought a tort action against a third party for injuries she suffered when the van she was riding in came to an abrupt stop causing her to fall out of her wheelchair.Â  After Washingtonâ€™s death, Miller proceeded with the action.Â  DHHS informed Miller it had a right to an assignment from Washington for amounts paid on her behalf by Medicaid as a result of the accident.Â  Miller settled the tort action before trial for $57,500.Â  The trial judge, in his order, specified the terms of the settlement agreement and described how the $57,500 would be allocated.Â  In relation to the amount paid to DHHS, the order states: \r\n\r\n  It further appears that out of the settlement proceeds, the total sum of Seven Thousand Two Hundred Forty-Four and 07/100 ($7,244.07) Dollars is being paid to the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services as full and final settlement of any liens held by the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.Â  \r\n  . . . \r\n  Moses Miller, as personal representative of the estate of Genobia Washington, is authorized and directed to pay the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (SCDHHS) the sum of Seven Thousand Two Hundred Forty-Four and 07/100 ($7,244.07) Dollars as full and final satisfaction of any lien held by SCDHHS and that such payment is an accord and satisfaction of the said lien . . . \r\n\r\nAfter Washingtonâ€™s death, DHHS notified the probate court and Miller of an $81,903.08 claim against Washingtonâ€™s estate.Â  Miller did not pay the claim, and DHHS filed a rule to show cause with the probate court seeking payment.Â  The probate court conducted a hearing, during which the parties stipulated that the amount of the claim in dispute was $74,659.01.Â  \r\nPrior to the initial hearing, Miller filed a Corrected Amended Inventory and Appraisement of Washingtonâ€™s estate with the probate court.Â  This filing reflected assets owned by Washington at her death, including her home and property upon which it sits.Â  Under the description of the property, the following notation was made: â€œThis property was condemned by the State of South Carolina D.O.T. for Interstate Right-of-Way.Â  No money was exchanged.â€Â  In addition, neither this filing, nor the Final Accounting filed by Miller, reflected the receipt of any money with regard to the condemnation.Â  \r\nDuring the hearing, Miller called Donna Crosby, the Director of Right-of-Way for the CRM West Program, which acts as a consultant performing right-of-way acquisitions for the South Carolina Department of Transportation (DOT).Â  While Millerâ€™s attorney examined Crosby, he questioned her about a release executed by DHHS.Â  DHHS executed a claim release releasing its $81,903 creditor claim filed against Washingtonâ€™s estate solely to allow a right-of-way on Washingtonâ€™s property to be conveyed to the DOT.Â  Pursuant to the claim release, DHHS retained its claim against the remainder of Washingtonâ€™s estate.Â  When Millerâ€™s attorney asked Crosby if any cash payments were made to Miller in connection with the conveyance to the DOT, the following dialog between Millerâ€™s attorney and Crosby occurred.\r\n\r\n  [Crosby].Â  We issued a check for $18,200.\r\n  [Millerâ€™s Attorney].Â  $18,200?\r\n  A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes\r\n  Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For payment of the actual piece of property?\r\n  A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.\r\n  Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And who was that paid to?\r\n  A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Miller - - I believe it was made payable to Mr. Miller, if I remember correctly.Â  \r\n\r\nAfter cross-examination by the attorney for DHHS, who confirmed the payment outright to Miller, the probate court then questioned Crosby as to the nature of the property rights the DOT received.Â  Crosby informed the court that the purchase of the property was a fee simple conveyance, and the DOT now owned the property outright.Â  In light of Crosbyâ€™s testimony, the probate court issued a Sua Sponte Interim Order requesting a copy of the check for $18,200 payable to Miller.Â  In addition, the court noted a discrepancy in the release signed by Melinda Clark, a representative from DHHS.Â  â€œThe claim release is dated December 18, 2000 but it refers to a Deed, dated December 26, 2000.â€Â  Therefore, the court requested Clarkâ€™s testimony as to the facts and circumstances concerning the release.Â  \r\nMiller also called Doris Pope as a witness during the initial hearing before the probate court.Â  He initially questioned her about her knowledge of the settlement with DHHS relating to the tort action, but proceeded to ask her about her claim against Washingtonâ€™s estate.Â  On cross-examination, Pope revealed she was Millerâ€™s fiancÃ© and she did not have a written contract for the services she provided to Washington.Â  The probate court further inquired about Popeâ€™s services and her lack of records as to those services.Â  During the probate courtâ€™s examination of Pope, she admitted she lived with Miller and Washington for the past two years and did not pay rent.Â  \r\nThe information requested by the probate judge was provided at a subsequent hearing.Â  The probate court then issued a final order declaring DHHSâ€™s claim valid.Â  In addition, the probate court ordered Miller to pay the $18,200 he received from SCDOT and $2,500 reflecting the value of the household furnishings he received, plus interest, to Washingtonâ€™s estate.Â  The probate court also determined the claim presented by Doris Pope was a â€œsham,â€ and ordered her to repay the $5,000 she received from Washingtonâ€™s estate, plus interest.Â  Miller appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed the order of the probate court.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nProceedings in the probate court regarding claims for money due are actions at law.Â  Matter of Estate of Tollison, 320 S.C. 132, 135, 463 S.E.2d 611, 613 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  A probate courtâ€™s findings of fact in an action at law will not be disturbed on appeal unless the record reveals no evidence to support the courtâ€™s findings or the probate court was controlled by an error of law.Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Â Jurisdiction Over DHHSâ€™s Claim for Reimbursement\r\nMiller argues the probate court erred in determining the circuit court did not have jurisdiction to issue an order satisfying both of DHHSâ€™s claims.Â  Essentially, Miller asserts the circuit courtâ€™s order stating the $7,244.07 payment from the settlement â€œas full and final settlement of any liens held by the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services,â€ acted as a full settlement of all claims by DHHS against Washington and her estate.Â  Therefore, he maintains the probate court does not have jurisdiction to review the claim by DHHS against Washingtonâ€™s estate.Â  We disagree.Â Â  \r\nDHHS brought its claim against Washingtonâ€™s estate pursuant to section 43-7-460 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004).Â  This section pertains to DHHSâ€™s ability to recover amounts paid for nursing facility care from a recipientâ€™s estate.Â  This section provides, in pertinent part: \r\n\r\n  (A) The State Department of Health and Human Services shall seek recovery of medical assistance paid under the Title XIX State Plan for Medical Assistance from the estate of an individual who:\r\n   . . . \r\n  \r\n    (2) was fifty-five years of age or older when the individual received medical assistance, but only for medical assistance consisting of nursing facility services, home and community-based services, and hospital and prescription drug services provided to individuals in nursing facilities or receiving home and community-based services.\r\n  \r\n\r\nÂ§ 43-7-460 (emphasis added).Â  Section 62-1-302 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004), states the subject matter jurisdiction of the probate court and provides: \r\n\r\n  (a) To the full extent permitted by the Constitution, and except as otherwise specifically provided, the probate court has exclusive original jurisdiction over all subject matter related to:\r\n  \r\n    (1)&nbsp; estates of decedents, including the contest of wills, construction of wills, and determination of heirs and successors of decedents and estates of protected persons . . .\r\n  \r\n\r\nSection 62-3-104 of the South Carolina Code (1987) describes the procedure under which claims against a decedentâ€™s estate will be administered.Â  This section states:Â  â€œAfter the appointment and until distribution, all proceedings and actions to enforce a claim against the estate are governed by the procedure prescribed by this article [Â§Â§62-3-101 et seq.].â€Â  Â§ 62-3-104.Â  \r\nDHHS brought a claim seeking reimbursement for Medicaid payment made on Washingtonâ€™s behalf for long-term care services provided to her in her home pursuant to section 43-7-460.Â  Section 43-7-460, as cited above, states claims under this section must be brought against the recipientâ€™s estate.Â  Because the Probate Code gives the probate court exclusive original jurisdiction over all matters relating to a decedentâ€™s estate, including claims against that estate, the probate court in this case clearly had exclusive original jurisdiction to determine the validity of DHHSâ€™s claim.Â  Therefore, the probate court did not err in determining the circuit court did not have jurisdiction over this claim and could not have declared it satisfied in its order.Â  \r\nII.Â  Two Separate Claims\r\nMiller argues the probate court erred in determining DHHS had two separate claims.Â  He maintains the claim filed by DHHS, pursuant to section 43-7-440 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004) and asserting its right to seek subrogation for medical expenses paid on behalf of Washington, is the same claim brought against her estate in this action.Â  He asserts the only difference in that claim and the claim presented in this action is DHHS brought the former claim against Washington, and DHHS brought the later claim against her estate.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn order to address this issue, we must compare the two statutes governing the claims brought by DHHS.Â  First, DHHS brought a claim for subrogation and assignment of rights pursuant to sections 43-7-410 to 450 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004), seeking recovery for payments made by Medicaid as a result of the accident in which Washington was injured.Â  Section 43-7-420(a), pertaining to DHHSâ€™s right of assignment of amounts recovered from third parties states:Â  â€œEvery applicant or recipient, only to the extent of the amount of the medical assistance paid by Medicaid, shall be deemed to have assigned his rights to recover such amounts so paid by Medicaid from any third party or private insurer to the State Health and Human Services Finance Commission.â€Â  Section 43-7-430(a), pertaining to DHHSâ€™s right to subrogation, states:Â  â€œThe State Health and Human Services Finance Commission shall be automatically subrogated, only to the extent of the amount of medical assistance paid by Medicaid, to the rights an applicant or recipient may have to recover such amounts so paid by Medicaid from any third party or private insurer.â€\r\nSecond, as stated previously, DHHS filed this claim against Washingtonâ€™s estate seeking reimbursement for long-term care services paid by Medicaid.Â  DHHS brought this claim pursuant to section 43-7-460 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004).Â  This section states:\r\n\r\n  (A) The State Department of Health and Human Services shall seek recovery of medical assistance paid under the Title XIX State Plan for Medical Assistance from the estate of an individual who:\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . \r\n\r\n  \r\n    (2) was fifty-five years of age or older when the individual received medical assistance, but only for medical assistance consisting of nursing facility services, home and community-based services, and hospital and prescription drug services provided to individuals in nursing facilities or receiving home and community-based services.\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn comparing the nature of these two claims and the statutes under which DHHS brought these claims, we find these claims are two separate and distinct claims and were brought under separate and unrelated sections of the South Carolina Code.Â  The prior claim was against Washington for payments made by Medicaid as a result of an accident for which she recovered from a third party; whereas, this claim is a claim against Washingtonâ€™s estate for reimbursement for payments made by Medicaid for long-term care services.Â  DHHS brought the prior claim pursuant to a statute allowing recovery from a third party tortfeasor.Â  Contrarily, DHHS brought this claim pursuant to a statute allowing for recovery from a recipientâ€™s estate.Â  \r\nThe letter from DHHS satisfying the earlier claim based on the tort recovery and settling for the $7,244.07 payment specifically included a release from the Casualty Recovery Department of DHHS only.Â  â€œWhen a contract is unambiguous a court must construe its provisions according to the terms the parties used; understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense.â€ Schulmeyer v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., 353 S.C. 491, 495, 579 S.E.2d 132, 134 (2003).Â  Therefore, we find the probate court did not err in its determination that two claims existed. \r\nIII.Â  Probate Courtâ€™s Sua Sponte Interim Order\r\nMiller argues the probate court erred in conducting its own investigation pursuant to its Sua Sponte Interim Order.Â  Miller argues the probate courtâ€™s actions were improper and in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct citing to Rule 501, SCACR.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 614, SCRE, governing the calling and interrogation of witnesses by the court, provides: \r\n\r\n  (a) Calling by Court.Â  In extraordinary circumstances, the court may, on its own motion or at the suggestion of a party, call witnesses, and all parties are entitled to cross-examine witnesses thus called.Â  Before calling a courtâ€™s witness, the court shall afford the parties a hearing on the matter outside the presence of the jury.\r\n  (b) Interrogation by Court.Â  When required by the interests of justice only, the court may interrogate witnesses.\r\n\r\nThe testimony provided by Crosby, as compared with Millerâ€™s prior filings with the probate court, indicates a discrepancy in his representations to the probate court.Â  We find these circumstances are extraordinary and meet the requirements pursuant to Rule 614, SCRE, allowing the probate court to call an additional witness.Â  In addition, the probate court afforded both parties notice of Clarkâ€™s testimony and the opportunity to cross-examine her, and therefore, neither was prejudiced by her testimony.Â  \r\nIV.Â  Invalidation of the Claim Release \r\nMiller asserts the probate court erred in finding the claim release executed by DHHSâ€™s in favor of the South Carolina Department of Transportation invalid.Â  Miller contends DHHS did not make a claim against the real property purchased by the DOT.Â  Therefore, the probate court improperly raised the issue on its own.Â  \r\nIn our review of the record, we find this issue was not properly preserved for appellate review.Â  â€œIn order to preserve an issue for appellate review, the issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.â€Â  Mizell v. Glover, 351 S.C. 392, 399, 570 S.E.2d 176, 180 (2002).Â  Miller did not object on the record to the judgeâ€™s raising of this issue.Â  Accordingly, we are unable to consider it on appeal.Â  \r\nV.Â  Invalidation of Doris Popeâ€™s Claim\r\nMiller also argues the probate court erred in invalidating Doris Popeâ€™s claim in its final order.Â  His argument is similar to the argument made with regard to the probate courtâ€™s invalidation of the claim release.Â  Miller asserts DHHS did not contest this claim, and therefore, the probate court improperly invalidated her claim.Â  \r\nAgain, we find this issue was not properly preserved for appellate review because Miller failed to make an objection on the record.Â  Mizell, 351 S.C. at 399, 570 S.E.2d at 180.Â  Therefore, we find the probate court did not err in addressing the validity of Popeâ€™s claim.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe probate court did not err in determining the circuit court did not have jurisdiction over this claim brought by DHHS and in determining this claim is a separate and distinct claim from DHHSâ€™s prior claim relating to Washingtonâ€™s tort claim against a third party.Â  In addition, the probate court did not act improperly in issuing its Sua Sponte Interim Order requesting additional testimony and evidence.Â  Finally, Millerâ€™s claims that the probate court erred in addressing the validity of the claim release executed by DHHS and the validity of Popeâ€™s claim against Washingtonâ€™s estate were not properly preserved for appellate review.Â  Therefore, the order of the circuit court affirming the probate court is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-145","title":"Kimbrell v.

Bannister, Jr., of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nJeffrey Falkner Wilkes, and Kim R. Varner, both of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â This is an appeal of a family courtâ€™s equitable distribution of marital assets.Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nDorothy Ann Hammond Kimbrell (Wife) and William Calvin Kimbrell, Jr. (Husband) married on February 27, 1982 and had three children together.Â  On February 16, 2000,Wife filed an action for divorce on the ground of physical cruelty and prayed for custody of the minor children, equitable division of the marital property, alimony, child support, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nFollowing a hearing, the family court issued a temporary order requiring, among other things, Husband to pay the guardian ad litemâ€™s initial fee of $1,000.Â  It ordered Husband to â€œmaintain use of the marital home and . . . be responsible for any insurance, taxes, costs, maintenance, or upkeep associated therewith.â€Â  The court also ordered Husband to pay Wife $4000 a month in unallocated support.Â  \r\nBy consent of the parties, Wife subsequently moved back into the marital home.Â  When Husband refused to continue paying the utilities and mortgage, Wife brought a rule to show cause action against him to enforce compliance with the temporary order.Â  The family court held that Husband was not in contempt because he was not required to pay $4000 in support as well as be responsible for the mortgage and the utilities of the marital residence.Â  \r\nThe parties entered into an agreement, approved by the family court, that placed custody of the children with Wife and equally divided the proceeds from the sale of the marital home, a 401K Plan, and the remainder of the marital estate, leaving the determination of which assets and debts constituted the marital estate for the family court.Â  The family court issued the order of divorce on the ground of continuous and uninterrupted separation for more than one year.Â  The family court subsequently issued a final order on the equitable division of the assets and debts in May of 2002.Â  Wifeâ€™s attorney filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, which was denied.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has authority to find the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â  This broad scope of review, however, does not require us to disregard the findings of the family court, nor does it relieve the appellant of the burden of convincing us that the family court committed error.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  We are mindful that the family court, which saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deferred Cash Bonus Program\r\n\r\nWife claims the trial court erred in excluding the post-separation portion of the incentive deferred cash bonus program from the marital estate.Â  She also claims it erred in estimating this income to be taxable to Husband at 40%.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe term â€˜marital propertyâ€™ means all real and personal property, which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2004).Â  Husbandâ€™s employerâ€™s deferred cash bonus program rewarded employees who were â€œproductive employee[s] of [the] companyâ€ and in good standing with the company for four years.Â  As the Wife acknowledges in her brief, the Husband received the bonuses â€œas an incentive to continue his employment.â€Â  The amount of the bonus was based on Husbandâ€™s earnings for a particular year.Â  However, he was not entitled to the funds unless he worked for the company for four more years and did not report those monies on his taxes until distribution at the end of the fourth year.Â  The trial court awarded Wife, after the subtraction of 40% to pay Husbandâ€™s taxes on each bonus, 75% of the 1997 deferred bonus, 50% of the 1998 deferred bonus, and 25% of the 1999 deferred bonus, if they ever vested.Â  \r\nWe find that the family courtâ€™s calculation of the marital portion of the deferred bonus program is not unreasonable.Â  Although the amount Husband earned for the bonuses was based on the market each year he was employed, he earned them by staying with the company for four more years.Â  The bonuses did not actually vest until they matured four years later, and he would not have received the monies if he left the company before the four years expired.Â  Thus, Husband had not earned the entire amount of the bonuses at the time of the filing of marital litigation.Â  Accordingly, we find no error in the family court prorating the bonuses.\r\nWe also find no error in the family courtâ€™s deduction of 40% of the bonuses prior to division to allow for taxes.Â  The family court must consider the tax consequences to each party as a result of equitable apportionment.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472(11) (Supp. 2004).Â  Husband testified that the distribution flows to him as taxable income at the tax rate of 40%.Â  We find the family courtâ€™s estimation of the Husbandâ€™s tax consequences was not unreasonable.Â  \r\n\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wachovia stock\r\n\r\nWife claims the family court erred in finding one account included the Wachovia stock from Husbandâ€™s incentive program.Â  We disagree.\r\nHusband testified that the Wachovia ILJ account encompassed the incentive program stocks.Â  Though Wife claims Husband did not produce some of the accounts in his property disclosure, she offers no evidence to the contrary.Â  Furthermore, Husband testified on cross-examination that Wife confused the accounts and double counted stock.Â  The family court, which was in a better position to evaluate the credibility of Husband and Wife in regard to the confusion in documentation, found Husband disclosed all the accounts.Â  The family court treated the account as marital property and divided it equitably.Â  Therefore, there was sufficient evidence for the family court to conclude that the incentive program stock was part and parcel of the Wachovia stock.Â  \r\n\r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IRA\r\n\r\nWife argues the family court erred in finding an IRA was non-marital.Â  Husband testified that the IRA, which he had held for seven years, was a rollover from his pre-marital employment with the exception of a percentage earned during two years of the marriage.Â  Though Wife testified that the entire IRA was marital property, she offered no evidence otherwise.Â  Husband admits the family court erred in holding the entire IRA was non-marital.Â  Therefore, we modify the order of the family court and hold 2/7 of the IRA is marital property and should be divided equally between the parties.Â  \r\n\r\nIV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marital fund withdrawals\r\n\r\nWife argues the family court erred in finding certain payments made from the marital fund to be marital debt.Â  We disagree.Â  Husband paid numerous marital debts from the marital fund.Â  The family court then ordered half of the debts to be deducted from Wifeâ€™s portion of the marital assets.Â  \r\nA. Guardian ad litem fees\r\nIn the temporary order, the family court ordered Husband to make the initial $1,000 payment to the guardian ad litem based on his available cash flow.Â  In the final order, the family court ordered Wife to be responsible for $1000 of the remaining $1500 balance owed to the guardian, finding that â€œthe expenditure of time by the guardian was necessitated by [Wifeâ€™s] actions and the fact that even after the expiration of two (2) years [Husband] still has not had a visitation with his daughters.â€Â  It held that the $1000 Husband withdrew from a marital account to pay the initial fee was an expense to be shared equally between the parties.Â  â€œAn award of guardian ad litem fees lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Nash v. Byrd, 298 S.C. 530, 537, 381 S.E.2d 913, 917 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  As the family court found the fees were incurred due to the wifeâ€™s conduct, we find no abuse of discretion in the court ordering the wife to be responsible for a majority of the fees.Â  Furthermore, the wife failed to cite any authority prohibiting the family court from reallocating the payment of the guardian fees ordered in the temporary order.Â  Accordingly, we find no error in the family courtâ€™s allocation of the guardianâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nB. BellSouth phone bill \r\nWife claims a bill from Bell South for $206.73 should be entirely Husbandâ€™s responsibility.Â  However, Wife admitted the bill was due before she moved out of the marital home.Â  Husband testified he gave Wife money for the bill at the time it was due.Â  Although Wife claimed she had paid the bill, Husband testified that he paid the bill in April because it had not been paid.Â  The family court, in finding the bill was a marital debt, â€œreceived ample testimony that the said bills were incurred prior to the separation and were for the benefit of the family.â€Â  As the family court was in the best position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses, we find no error in its holding that the bill was a marital debt.Â  See Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nC. Pharmacy bill\r\nBased on the testimony of the parties, the family court also found the pharmacy bill to be marital debt.Â  Wife admitted the bill, which was for prescriptions for Wife and the partiesâ€™ son, became due before the parties separated.Â  Her only argument against being responsible for part of the bill was that she thought because Husband did not send her the bill, it was his personal bill.Â  We find no error in the family courtâ€™s determination that this bill was in fact a marital debt.Â  \r\nD. Cable bill and mortgage payment\r\nHusband testified he paid the mortgage payment for February in June of 2000.Â  In addition, Husband claimed that in July of 2000 he had to pay two months of cable bills because the bills had not been paid at the time Wife left the marital home.Â  The family court found Husbandâ€™s testimony credible and declared this to be marital debt.Â  As the family court was in the best position to observe and evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and their conflicting testimony, we find no error in this determination.Â  See Bowers, 349 S.C. at 91, 561 S.E.2d at 613.Â  \r\nE. Furniture\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Finally, the wife challenges the family courtâ€™s holding that bedding Husband purchased constituted marital debt.Â  The family court determined the parties had agreed during mediation to use money from the marital funds to purchase bedroom furniture for the children to use when they visited Husband because Wife retained all of the original furniture.Â  The record reflects evidence of this agreement.Â  Therefore, we find the family court did not err in deducting half of the costs of the furniture from Wifeâ€™s share of the marital assets.Â  \r\n\r\nV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jewelry\r\n\r\nWife argues the trial court erred in finding her jewelry had increased in value.Â  We disagree.\r\nWife listed all of her jewelry as valued at $7,450.00.Â  The family court noted Husband valued the jewelry at a retail price of $35,000.Â  The court rejected both of these valuations.Â  Considering all of the evidence, the family court valued the marital portion of all jewelry to be $12,500.00.Â  This amount included the marital portion of the engagement ring and all of the wifeâ€™s other jewelry.Â  The original engagement ring was stolen and replaced with a more expensive ring after the parties had been married some years.Â  The court recognized Husband had documentation to support a valuation of Wifeâ€™s engagement ring of almost $9000 â€œbased on 1995 prices and that the $5000.00 Dollar wholesale increase in the engagement ring was not considered in the said coverage.â€Â  Husband valued the remaining jewelry as $7,500.Â  As the family courtâ€™s valuation of the jewelry was within the range of evidence, we find no error.Â  See Woodward v. Woodward, 294 S.C. 210, 215, 363 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. App. 1987) (stating the family courtâ€™s valuation of property will be affirmed if it is within the range of the evidence).\r\n\r\nVI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mortgage payments\r\n\r\nWife claims the family court erred in deducting five months of mortgage payments from her one half share of the marital property.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â  The temporary order required Husband to pay the mortgage for the months now being attributed to Wife.Â  However, in the same order, the family court awarded Wife $4000 a month in unallocated support.Â  In its order refusing to hold Husband in contempt for failure to pay the mortgage the family court clarified the temporary order by finding Husband was not responsible for making the mortgage and utility payments in a house in which he no longer resided because the temporary order â€œwas . . . predicated on [Husband] having possession of the marital residence at his costs.â€Â  Husband continued to pay wife $4000 a month in support during this time.Â  Based on the courtâ€™s finding, Wife was responsible for the mortgage payments on the home beginning with the month she moved back into the house.Â  Therefore, we find the family court correctly ordered the five months of mortgage payments be deducted from Wifeâ€™s share of the marital assets.Â  Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAs Husband admitted that 2/7 of the IRA at issue was marital, we modify the family courtâ€™s decision finding the entire IRA was non-marital and hold 2/7 of the IRA is marital property for purposes of equitable distribution.Â  We find no error in the family courtâ€™s decisions as to the remainder of property at issue on appeal.Â  The family courtâ€™s order is hereby\r\n Affirmed AS MODIFIED.\r\n HUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ. concur.Â \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-146","title":"State v.

Jackson Kimball, III, Special Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-149\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2005 â€“ Filed March 3, 2005\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nBrian S. McCoy, of Rock Hill, for Appellant.\r\nLucy London McDow, of Rock Hill, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Respondent Mark Kosich brought this action against Appellant Decker Industries, claiming Decker failed to adequately compensate him for services performed as a sales representative on behalf of the company.Â  The special circuit judge agreed and awarded Kosich recovery in the amount he would have likely received as commission under contract for his services.Â  Decker appeals, arguing the special circuit judge erred by awarding legal damages in an equitable action seeking quantum meruit recovery.Â  We agree and reverse and remand for a determination of Kosichâ€™s recovery under the proper standard for an action in equity.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThe parties in this case both work in the niche market of â€œbulk materials handling systems.â€Â  As best we can determine from the limited record before us, these handling systems include the various machines and equipment used for the conveyance and storage goods and raw materials in large-scale factories and plants.Â  At the time this action arose, Respondent Mark Kosich marketed and sold these bulk materials handling systems on behalf of various companies that designed and built the systems.Â  \r\nOne such company, Appellant Decker Industries, enlisted the aid of Kosich in marketing their custom designed and built handling systems to companies in the process of building new factories.Â  They entered into an agreement under which Kosich would find these sales opportunities for Decker in exchange for some type of compensation.Â  This agreement, however, was never fleshed out in any specific detail and never memorialized in writing.Â  Any promises or assurances made to Kosich regarding compensation were apparently couched in the vaguest of termsâ€”such as that Deckerâ€™s president told Kosich that he would â€œtake care ofâ€ him with regard to payment for his work. \r\nUnder this loose understanding, Kosich went to work looking for sales opportunities for Decker.Â  About one month later, Kosich learned of a project of Owens-Corning to construct a plant in Chester, South Carolina, to manufacture synthetic marble.Â  Kosich marketed Deckerâ€™s handling systems to Owens-Corning, helping Decker secure a contract for the project.Â  Decker ultimately supplied the bulk handling systems for the Owens-Corning project and was paid in excess of $4 million for the job.Â  Despite the large size of the contract, Decker paid Kosich only $5,000 as a â€œfinders fee.â€Â  Decker, however, claimed that it would have compensated Kosich more generously if the project had ultimately turned a profit for Decker. \r\nKosich subsequently brought this action against Decker asserting claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.[1]Â  The matter was referred to a master-in-equity sitting as a special circuit court judge.Â  Following a bench trial, the trial court found as a matter of law that no contract existed between Kosich and Decker.Â  The court, however, did find that Kosich was entitled to recovery under the equitable doctrine of quantum meruit (unjust enrichment).Â  With regard to the appropriate amount of recovery, the court determined that Kosich should be compensated based upon the amount he would typically earn as a commission for his services:\r\n\r\nThere being no agreement as to the amount of the commission, or as to a percentage upon which to calculate it, the Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to a reasonable commission under all of the circumstances of this case.Â  The record in this case indicates that there is no set industry standard for commissions.Â  The testimony establishes that commissions range from 1/2% to 20% of the contract price of the equipment sold.Â  Typically, the larger the sale, the lower the commission percentage.Â  \r\n\r\nThe court determined that, under the circumstances of this case, Kosich was â€œentitled to a commission under the doctrine of quantum meruit, or implied contract, inÂ  the total amount ofÂ  $96,253.21â€â€”three percent of the total payments received by Decker for the equipment supplied for the Owens-Corning project.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIn the present appeal, Decker does not dispute the trial courtâ€™s finding that Kosich is entitled to recovery under the equitable theory of quantum meruit.Â  Decker instead takes exception to the manner in which the trial court calculated the amount of recoveryâ€”specifically arguing that the court applied a legal rather than equitable standard for determining the appropriate recovery.Â  We agree.\r\nIn an action at law, the measure of damages is determined by the partiesâ€™ agreement, the goal being to put the non-breaching party in as good a position as he would have been had the contract been performed.Â  In equity, however, â€œthe measure of the recovery is the extent of the duty or obligation imposed by law, and is expressed by the amount which the court considers the defendant has been unjustly enriched at the expense of the plaintiff.â€ Myrtle Beach Hosp., Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 341 S.C. 1, 8, 532 S.E.2d 868, 872 (2000) (quoting United States Rubber Prods., Inc. v. Town of Batesburg, 183 S.C. 49, 55, 190 S.E. 120, 126 (1937)). \r\nQuantum meruit is an equitable remedy allowing recovery for unjust enrichment. Columbia Wholesale Co., Inc. v. Scudder May N.V.,&nbsp; 312 S.C. 259, 261, 440 S.E.2d 129, 130&nbsp;(1994).Â  Absent the existence of an express contract, recovery under quantum meruit is based on quasi-contract, the elements of which are: (1) a benefit is conferred upon the defendant by the plaintiff; (2) the defendant realizes a benefit; and (3) it would be unjust for the defendant to retain the benefit without paying its value.Â  Id.; Myrtle Beach Hosp. at 8-9, 532 S.E.2d at 872.Â  Accordingly, the amount of recovery under quantum meruit must be determined solely by reference to the value of the benefit unjustly retained by the defendant, not the amount the plaintiff would have received had he realized the full benefit of the bargain under the terms of a contract. See Stringer Oil Co., Inc. v. Bobo, 320 S.C. 369, 373, 465 S.E.2d 366, 369 (Ct. App. 1995) (citing several cases in support of the proposition that â€œthe â€˜reasonable valueâ€™ which plaintiff may recover in quantum meruit is not the value of labor but the value of the benefit resulting therefromâ€).\r\nIn the present case, the trial courtâ€™s determination that Kosich was entitled to recovery in the form of a three percent commission veers from these equitable principles.Â  By fixing the amount of recovery as a â€œcommissionâ€ earned by Kosich, the award necessarily becomes a function of what Kosich would have received had a contract been entered into and fully performed, rather than a determination based strictly on the value of the benefit actually conferred upon Decker.Â  This analysis, therefore, crosses the line from an equitable remedy to a legal remedy.\r\nTo be sure, we recognize the challenge of fashioning an appropriate remedy in this case.Â  Determining the value of the benefit to Decker of Kosichâ€™s marketing services in such a highly specialized industry without relying upon the bargained-for contractual terms that normally govern these relationships will be a difficult job.Â  Nevertheless, this is the inquiry required under the principles governing quantum meruit recovery.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor these reasons, we conclude the trial court applied an incorrect standard in determining Kosichâ€™s recovery under quantum meruit.Â  We therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] A cause of action for promissory estoppel was also asserted.Â  The court, however, found that claim was inapplicable to the facts of this case.Â Â Â  This ruling was not appealed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-150","title":"Lindsey v.

Murray Hughes, of Pickens, for Appellants.Â  \r\nHarry I. Rivers, Jr., of Easley; Herman E. Cox, of Greenville; and Kenneth D. Acker, of Pickens, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Lou Lindsey, Iris Hill, and Emma Cade (Appellants) appeal the trial courtâ€™s determination that a road joining the partiesâ€™ property with neighboring landowners is not a public road or easement and that any private easement interest was abandoned or lost by adverse possession. We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nLindsey and Hill purchased 59.5 acres of property in 1990.Â  A river bisects their property, dividing it into a 20-acre eastern tract and a 39.5-acre western tract upon which the couple built their home.Â  There is no longer a bridge over the river, and it cannot be crossed by a vehicle at any point that it passes through their property.[2]Â  \r\nPlats of the property show the location of an old road running from the river on the eastern tract, the opposite side of the river from where the home is located, across the property of Emma Cade, a landlocked 20 acre tract situated between the Lindsey/Hill parcel and the property belonging to David Alexander and Golden Creek Baptist Church (Respondents).Â  The plats indicate the road continues eastward forming the southern and northern boundary of the Alexander and Golden Creek properties respectively.Â  The old road terminates at a gate placed there by Alexander.Â  \r\nAlexander blocked access to the road sometime around 1990 or 1991 by placing a metal cable and later a gate at the point where the road intersects the main highway between his property and the churchâ€™s property.Â  The road has remained unused since Alexander erected the gate. Â It has been in serious disrepair for decades and is impassable by vehicular traffic.Â  \r\nAppellants brought a declaratory judgment action against Alexander, Golden Creek Baptist Church, and a Trustee of the Hydrick Residuary Trust arguing the road was, or at one time had been, a public road or easement entitling them to access.Â  They requested injunctive relief requiring Alexander to remove the gate.Â  The trial court ruled in favor of Alexander, finding the road was not a public road or an easement and that if it â€œhad ever been at one time in the distant past, some type of public or private road, easement or highway, clearly and unquestionably it has been abandoned as such and has been extinguished as either a public or private easement.â€[3]Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nA suit for declaratory relief may be legal or equitable, and is characterized as such by the nature of the underlying issue outlined in the complaint.Â  Clark v. Hargrave, 323 S.C. 84, 86, 473 S.E.2d 474, 476 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The determination of the existence of an easement is a question of fact in a law action.Â  Slear v. Hanna, 329 S.C. 407, 410, 496 S.E.2d 633, 635 (1998).Â  In an action at law tried without a jury, the judgeâ€™s findings of fact will not be disturbed unless there is no evidence to support them.Â  Townes Assoc., Ltd.&nbsp;v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).\r\nFirst, Appellants contend the trial court erred by determining the road was not a public easement, road, or highway.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Outlaw v. Moise, 222 S.C. 24, 71 S.E.2d 509 (1952), our supreme court established the rule for proving the existence of a public easement.Â  The court stated:\r\n\r\n[W]here lands are platted and sales are made with reference to the plat, the acts of the owner in themselves merely create private rights in the grantees to the use of the streets and ways laid down on the plat or referred to in the conveyance.Â  But these rights are purely in the nature of private rights founded upon a grant or covenant, and no public rights attach to such streets or lands until there has been an express or implied acceptance of the dedication, evidenced either by general public use or by the acts of the public authorities.\r\n\r\nId, at 31, 71 S.E.2d at 512 (emphasis added).\r\nTroy Porter, Director of Roads and Bridges for Pickens County for over 20 years, testified the road in question had never been dedicated to the public or maintained by Pickens County.Â  Porter also testified he was personally familiar with the area and considered the road an â€œold trail or private road.â€Â  The parties all agree the road has been impassable for decades and remains blocked by trees and deep gullies prohibiting general public use. Accordingly, we find there was sufficient evidence contained in the record to support the special refereeâ€™s finding the road failed to qualify as a public easement or roadway. \r\nNext, Appellants argue the trial court erred by finding any private easement they, or their predecessors in title, may have had in the road was abandoned.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe primary elements of abandonment are the ownerâ€™s intention to abandon and either his express declaration or the external act by which his intention is carried into effect.Â  Immanuel Baptist Church of N. Augusta v. Barnes, 274 S.C. 125, 131, 264 S.E.2d 142, 144-45 (1980).Â  Hill testified that when she and her husband bought their land, the road required a four-wheel drive vehicle to traverse it, and that she had seen no vehicles on the road since they purchased the property.Â  There was no evidence in the record Appellants attempted to use the road or clear the overgrowth to make it passable.Â  Alexander testified no one had objected to his actions blocking the entrance to the road or sought access since he erected the metal cable and later a gate.Â  He further testified that from the time his father acquired his property in the mid-1960s, the road has never been used, and since he moved onto the property in 1979, he has never seen a vehicle on the road.Â  Finally, aerial photographs introduced into evidence show the road diminishing in clarity between 1965 and 1987.Â  Moreover, it is undisputed the road is now impassable.Â  Accordingly, we find sufficient evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s conclusion that any private easement that may have existed has been abandoned.\r\nThe trial court found that even if any private easement had not been abandoned, Appellants lost any right they may have had to the use of the road because Alexander extinguished them by adverse possession.Â  Although Appellants challenge this finding, we need not address the issue because the ruling that any private easement has been abandoned disposes of the case.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling appellate court need not address remaining issues when disposition of prior issue is\r\ndispositive).&nbsp; \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Â Â Â Â Â Â  A bridge that once connected the two tracts washed away during a flood in the 1930s and was never rebuilt.Â  \r\n[3] Â Â Â Â Â Â  The trial court noted that counsel for Golden Creek made a brief appearance stating the church â€œdid not and would not take an active part in the litigation.â€Â  The court also noted the Hydrick trust failed to appear.Â  Alexander was the only defendant to file a response.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-151","title":"State v.

Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Timothy Darrell Davis appeals his murder conviction, arguing the trial court erred in refusing to clarify its voluntary manslaughter jury instruction, specifically its explanation of sufficient legal provocation.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n\r\nThis case arises from the September 2001 stabbing death of Heath Barnette.Â  Barnette was having a relationship with Davisâ€™ estranged wife, Lorinda, and was her co-worker at Miracle Hill Ministries.Â  Davis and Lorinda separated in January or February of 2001.Â  Davis wanted to reconcile with Lorinda and saw Barnette as an obstacle to that goal.Â  Beginning in June, Davis began contacting Lorindaâ€™s family as well as supervisors and clergy at her workplace to discuss the situation.Â  He asked questions about Barnette and his relationship with Lorinda, asked others to intervene, and asked for a meeting where he could confront Barnette.Â  He also asked Lorinda to stop seeing Barnette and told her he would not let her have a divorce.Â  \r\nAdditionally, in separate conversations with both Lorinda and her mother, Davis threatened to take the coupleâ€™s two children away and keep them from Lorinda.Â  Because of these threats, Lorinda moved the children to an undisclosed out-of-state location until she could handle the matter in court.Â  \r\nThe stabbing occurred on September 3, approximately four to six weeks after Lorinda relocated the children.Â  Eyewitnesses saw two men leave Lorindaâ€™s apartment.Â  The first man, bleeding from a wound, was being chased by the other, who was wielding a knife.[2]Â  Some of the witnesses reported seeing the man with the knife repeatedly stabbing or attempting to stab the injured man.Â  When Barnette eventually fell to the ground, Davis ran back to his truck.Â  \r\nIn a written statement to police, Davis offered the following version of events.Â  He entered Lorindaâ€™s apartment through a window, reportedly to find information about his children.Â  Inside he encountered Barnette, who was already in the apartment.Â  Barnette asked Davis to leave and threatened to call the police. Â Davis actually encouraged Barnette to call because he did not think Barnette should be in the apartment.Â  Davis offered to leave if Barnette would go outside with him so other people could see they had both been in Lorindaâ€™s apartment.Â  Barnette said one of them was leaving and started making threatening advances, came at Davis to grab him, and then came at Davis swinging.Â  Davis grabbed a knife from the block on the kitchen counter and told Barnette he did not want to hurt him but did not want to get hurt.Â  Davis suggested they go outside, but Barnette continued to move toward him.Â  Davis explained he was wielding the knife to keep Barnette away.Â  He said, â€œI jabbed the knife outward away from me.Â  And it stuck him in his right side/abdomen.Â  I wanted to only cut him at worst, but wound up stabbing him partly due to our momentum while moving toward each other.â€ Â After the stabbing, Davis followed Barnette outside and got in his truck, still holding the knife.Â  He then left, stopping to throw the knife in the river.Â  In earlier oral statements to police as well as conversations with Lorindaâ€™s mother and a pastor, Davis told basically the same story except that in those conversations he claimed Barnette lunged at him, running into the knife.Â  In his conversation with a pastor, Davis admitted that once outside the apartment, he â€œyelled something after [Barnette] to the effect of this will teach you to mess around with another guyâ€™s wife,â€ before realizing what he had done and fleeing the scene.Â  \r\nThe State asked the court â€œto charge number one, adultery as provocation, adultery, and manslaughter charge.â€Â  The trial court agreed, and confirmed it would charge on murder, voluntary manslaughter, self-defense, and accident.Â  Davisâ€™ counsel told the trial court, â€œI think the facts -- the four charges that youâ€™re going to charge are sufficient.â€Â  The trial court instructed the jury as indicated and included the following explanation of voluntary manslaughter:\r\n\r\n  Now manslaughter is defined as the taking of a human being -- the life of a human being without malice, but in sudden heat of passion when the heat of passion is caused or brought about by a sufficient legal provocation.Â  If a person flies into a sudden heat of passion upon a sufficient legal provocation and it results in the death of another, the law says that the act having been done under those circumstances, it would be manslaughter and not murder.\r\n  To illustrate, if I were to go up to one of you and commit an unwarranted attack upon you say by striking you in the face and you acting under the heat of passion aroused by my act of hitting you were to kill me then you would not be guilty of murder but of manslaughter because you killed me in sudden heat of passion caused by my unwarranted attack.\r\n  Now, ladies and gentlemen, I charge you that murder may be reduced to manslaughter if the act was committed in the heat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation.Â  I just explained that to you.\r\n  And I further charge you that adultery may in some instances serve as a sufficient legal provocation.Â  However, spousal adultery is not a license to kill.Â  The killing of a paramour may be reduced from murder to manslaughter where -- only where they are -- where the couple or paramour and the spouse are found engaged in sexual intercourse or some close embrace because this could constitute sufficient legal provocation.\r\n  Therefore the stabbing of a paramour may be reduced from murder to manslaughter where a couple, a paramour and a spouse are found engaged in sexual intercourse or some other close contact because this could constitute a sufficient legal provocation.\r\n  However, ladies and gentlemen, I charge you that where there has been a cooling off time sufficient for a person of ordinary reason and control to rid himself of the overpowering passion caused by the act and the stabbing, the law would say that thatâ€™s murder and not manslaughter.Â  \r\n\r\nDavisâ€™ counsel asked the trial court to clarify the jury instruction by explaining a paramour can also â€œbe a slapper,â€ but the court found it had adequately covered the definition of sufficient legal provocation.Â  The jury found Davis guilty of murder and the trial court sentenced him to life in prison.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nDavis argues the trial courtâ€™s instruction was confusing and did not fit the facts of the case, because it failed to sufficiently define legal provocation as it relates to adultery.Â  Davis suggests the trial court should have explained more clearly that although a person must find his spouse engaged in a close embrace for adultery to constitute sufficient legal provocation, if the spouseâ€™s paramour attacks the person, that may constitute sufficient legal provocation to reduce the murder to manslaughter.Â  Read as a whole, the charge did not constitute reversible error.\r\nA trial court must determine the law to be charged based on the evidence at trial.Â  State v. Crosby, 355 S.C. 47, 51, 584 S.E.2d. 110, 112 (2003).Â  The trial court should charge only the law applicable to the case, because the purpose of jury instructions is to enlighten the jury.Â  State v. Lee, 298 S.C. 362, 364, 380 S.E.2d 834, 836 (1989).Â  Jury instructions that do not fit the facts of the case may confuse the jury.Â  Id.Â  On appeal, a jury charge must be reviewed in its entirety and if the charge as a whole is free from error, isolated portions that may be misleading do not constitute reversible error. Â State v. Smith, 315 S.C. 547, 554, 446 S.E.2d 411, 415 (1994).Â  â€œThe substance of the law must be charged to the jury, not particular verbiage.â€Â  State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 261, 565 S.E.2d 298, 303 (2002). \r\nâ€œVoluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being in the sudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation.â€Â  State v. Cooley, 342 S.C. 63, 67, 536 S.E.2d 666, 668 (2000).Â  Spousal adultery may serve as sufficient legal provocation, but is not a license to kill.Â  State v. Gadsden, 314 S.C. 229, 233, 442 S.E.2d, 594, 597 (1994).Â  For example, the case of a killer lying in wait or searching for the guilty embrace is not one involving sufficient legal provocation.Â  Id. \r\nAs part of its jury charge, the trial court enumerated the elements of voluntary manslaughter.Â  It further defined sufficient legal provocation, providing examples of an unwarranted attack as well as provocation resulting from a person finding his spouse in a guilty embrace with a paramour.Â  The trial court also explained why not all situations involving an adulterous spouse serve to reduce murder to manslaughter.Â  Even if somewhat confusing, the trial court sufficiently explained the law of voluntary manslaughter.Â  In fact, the evidence focused heavily on the relationship between Lorinda and Barnette, and Davisâ€™s near obsession with it, thereby raising the adulterous spouse issue to the trial court.Â  The trial court instructed the jury on the law of voluntary manslaughter, including situations involving adultery but also including provocation from an unwarranted attack.Â  The jury charge was based on the evidence presented and the relevant law.Â  The charge was without reversible error.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Â Â Â Â Â Â  One witness testified he had also seen the same man walk up to Lorindaâ€™s apartment the day before the stabbing.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-153","title":"Blassingame v.

Vernon Mills, Inc., the Employer, appeals from the circuit courtâ€™s order reversing the decision of the Appellate Panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission in which the Panel held Claimant James Blassingame had failed to timely give notice to the Employer that he had sustained an injury at work.Â  We reverse. [1] Â Â Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nBlassingame worked in the shipping department of the Employer.Â  He alleged that on October 9, 2001, he injured his back while pulling a roll of cloth.Â  Blassingame stated that he immediately told his co-worker, Clarence Thomason that he had hurt his back.Â  Thomason confirmed that Blassingame had told him about the injury and that he advised him to report it to their supervisor, Lee Pruett.Â  Blassingame approached Pruett and told her his back was hurting.Â  Pruett went to her supervisor, Brian Pilgrim, because Blassingame had numerous â€œoccurrencesâ€ on his work record from leaving work early.Â  Pilgrim and Pruett explained to Blassingame that because of the prior occurrences, he was possibly facing termination under company policy if he garnered additional occurrences.Â  Blassingame stated that when he was told that if he left work, he may be fired, he returned to work.Â  About thirty minutes later, he returned to Pruett to tell her that he had to leave because of his back pain.Â  Although Pruett acknowledged that Blassingame spoke to her about the back pain he was experiencing and asked to be allowed to leave and see a doctor, she denied that he told her he had been injured while working.Â  \r\nBlassingame saw his family doctor, Dr. Winston Floyd, that day.Â  A week later, he presented an excuse from Dr. Floyd to Pruett.Â  In this excuse Dr. Floyd wrote:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Blassingame was seen in this office on October 9, 2001, complaining of severe low back pain.Â  Examination at that time was suggestive of the possibility of disk disease.Â  He was started on Vioxx, 50 mg a day and placed on warm compresses and given a work excuse until the following Friday.Â  X-rays of the lumbar sacral spine were taken.\r\n  When he returned for follow-up evaluation he had excellent response with Vioxx without complete resolution of the pain.Â  X-Ray exam showed extensive mild degenerative changes of the vertebral disk.Â  \r\n\r\nBy the time Blassingame presented the doctorâ€™s excuse, the Employer had terminated his employment due to his absences.\r\nBlassingame filed a Form 50 on February 5, 2002.Â  The Employer denied the claim, asserting in part that it was not given notice of the injury.Â  The Single Commissioner held Blassingame had properly notified the Employer of his work related accident and back injury.Â  She further held Blassingame had sustained a compensable work related injury and was entitled to medical treatment and temporary total compensation until he reached maximum medical improvement.Â  The Employer appealed this decision to the Appellate Panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  The Appellate Panel reversed the decision of the Single Commissioner.Â  It held Blassingame failed to meet his burden of proof to establish he had given notice of his injury within 90 days as required by law.Â  It further held Blassingame had failed to give a reasonable excuse for not providing adequate notice and that the Employer was prejudiced by his failure to give notice.Â  Blassingame appealed to the circuit court, which reversed the decision of the Appellate Panel.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  This court can reverse or modify the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision only if the appellantâ€™s substantial rights have been prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law or is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 454, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (Supp. 2003).Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor evidence viewed from one side, but such evidence, when the whole record is considered, as would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the [Appellate Panel] reached.â€Â  Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.Â  The possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions does not prevent the Appellate Panelâ€™s conclusions from being supported by substantial evidence.Â  Tiller v. Natâ€™l Health Care Ctr., 334 S.C. 333, 338, 513 S.E.2d 843, 845 (1999).\r\nThe Appellate Panel is the ultimate fact finder in workersâ€™ compensation cases and is not bound by the single commissionerâ€™s findings of fact.Â  Ross v. American Red Cross, 298 S.C. 490, 492, 381 S.E.2d 728, 730 (1989).Â  â€œAlthough it is logical for the [Appellate Panel], which did not have the benefit of observing the witnesses, to give weight to the Single Commissionerâ€™s opinion, the [Appellate Panel] is empowered to make its own findings of fact and to reach its own conclusions of law consistent or inconsistent with those of the Single Commissioner.â€Â  Etheredge v. Monsanto Co., 349 S.C. 451, 454-55, 562 S.E.2d 679, 681 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œThe final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the [Appellate Panel].Â  It is not the task of this Court to weigh the evidence as found by the [Appellate Panel].â€Â  Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442 (citations omitted). \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nThe Employer argues the circuit court erred in reversing the decision of the Appellate Panel of the Workerâ€™s Compensation Commission.Â  We agree.\r\nThe statutory notice requirements provide:\r\n\r\n  Every injured employee or his representative shall immediately on the occurrence of an accident, or as soon thereafter as practicable, give or cause to be given to the employer a notice of the accident and the employee shall not be entitled to physicianâ€™s fees nor to any compensation which may have accrued under the terms of this Title prior to the giving of such notice, unless it can be shown that the employer, his agent or representative, had knowledge of the accident or that the party required to give such notice had been prevented from doing so by reason of physical or mental incapacity or the fraud or deceit of some third person.Â  No compensation shall be payable unless such notice is given within ninety days after the occurrence of the accident or death, unless reasonable excuse is made to the satisfaction of the Commission for not giving such notice and the Commission is satisfied that the employer has not been prejudiced thereby.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-20 (1985).\r\nThis section does not provide a specific method of giving notice.Â  Hanks v. Blair Mills, 286 S.C. 378, 381, 335 S.E.2d 91, 93 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  The purpose of the notice provision is to actually put the employer on notice of the injury so it can investigate it immediately after its occurrence and can furnish medical care for the employee in order to minimize the disability and its own liability.Â  Id.Â  â€œFor adequate notice, there must be â€˜some knowledge of accompanying facts connecting the injury or illness with the employment, and indicating to a reasonably conscientious manager that the case might involve a potential compensation claim.â€™â€ Etheredge v. Monsanto Co., 349 S.C. 451, 457, 562 S.E.2d 679, 682 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting Larsonâ€™s Workersâ€™ Compensation Law Â§ 126.03[1][b] (2001)).Â  Although the provision for notice should be liberally construed in favor of claimants, â€œthere are limitations upon that rule and the statutory requirement cannot be disregarded altogether.â€Â  Mintz v. Fiske-Carter Constr. Co., 218 S.C. 409, 414, 63 S.E.2d 50, 52 (1951).\r\nIn Hanks, this court found the employer was put on notice based on the claimantâ€™s medical and work history and by a letter from the company doctor, in which the doctor stated the claimant was suffering from chronic lung disease and recommended a transfer to an area having a dust level at or below the permissible exposure limits.Â  Similarly, in Etheredge, this court found a doctorâ€™s letter, in which the doctor stated the claimant had acute muscle spasms and strains that were aggravated by overhead lifting, in addition to the claimantâ€™s known work history as a draw/wind operator, which required her to lift heavy spools above her head, provided the employer with adequate notice.Â  In both Hanks and Etheredge, this court found the Commissionâ€™s findings of adequate notice were supported by substantial evidence.Â  \r\nBlassingame testified that he told Pruett that he had hurt his back pulling a roll of cloth.Â  His co-worker, Clarence Thomason, confirmed that Blassingame told him about his back injury.Â  He also stated he saw Blassingame speaking with Pruett, but did not hear what he said.Â  Blassingame presented medical notes from his orthopedist and physical therapist in which it is noted he stated he experienced an onset of back pain while pulling a roll and that he had reported this to his supervisor.Â  \r\nPruett and Pilgrim, however, denied Blassingame had blamed the pain of which he complained on a work-related injury.Â  Pruett testified, â€œHe had told me that he was, that he had hurt his back, that his back, actually he said that his back was hurting and that he wanted to go to the doctor.â€Â  She stated he never mentioned hurting his back while pulling the roll.Â  Pruett explained that it did not strike her as unusual that Blassingame requested to leave in order to see a doctor because he â€œwas always going somewhere.â€Â  She stated he had many occurrences on his record for leaving work for one reason or the other.Â  She explained that when she was talking to him on the day of the alleged accident, her main concern was whether he would be fired because of all of the occurrences.Â  She did not conduct any type of investigation into the cause of Blassingameâ€™s back pain.Â  \r\nPruett stated that when Blassingame brought her the doctorâ€™s excuse a week after his last day at work, he did not say anything to her about it.Â  Rather, he walked in, gave her the note, and walked out.Â  This doctorâ€™s excuse does not specify that Blassingame injured his back at work.Â  \r\nIn addition, Blassingame had sustained a back injury in the past.Â  Pilgrim testified he was aware of Blassingameâ€™s back problems and that he knew Blassingame was taking Vioxx before his termination.Â  He also stated that Blassingame had requested a medication called Back Well in the past.Â  \r\nThe circuit court held:Â  \r\n\r\n  [T]he contradictory testimony of [Blassingameâ€™s] supervisor is not sufficient to overcome the direct testimony of [Blassingame] that he advised his supervisor of his work related injury, the corroborating testimony of Clarence Thomason, medical evidence from the same day of the accident and later which shows that the Claimant reported a work related injury, and Dr. Floydâ€™s note and work excuse provided to the employer a few days after the accident.Â  \r\n\r\nIn making this finding, the circuit court improperly weighed the evidence.Â  The question in reviewing an appeal from the Appellate Panel is not whether there is substantial evidence to support the appealing partyâ€™s position, but whether there is substantial evidence to support the decision of the Appellate Panel.Â  See Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc. 336 S.C. 154, 161, 519 S.E.2d 102, 106 (1999) (finding that although there was evidence from which the Commission could have found the other way, there was also clearly evidence which would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion it reached, and thus the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the circuit courtâ€™s affirmance of the Commissionâ€™s decision).Â  We find substantial evidence does exist in this case to support the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision that Blassingame failed to properly notify the Employer of his injury.Â  \r\nPruett and Pilgrim both testified that while Blassingame complained of back pain, he did not inform them that he had been injured while working.Â  They stated his request to leave was not unusual given his history of leaving work early.Â  Furthermore, they were aware that in the past Blassingame had some back problems for which he had taken Vioxx and requested additional medication from the Employer.Â  Considering these facts, the Appellate Panel could reasonably conclude that the doctorâ€™s excuse, which did not specify Blassingame had sustained a work-related injury, was not enough to put the Employer on notice of a potential workersâ€™ compensation claim.Â  \r\nIn addition, we find the Appellate Panelâ€™s determination that the Employer was prejudiced by the lack of notice is supported by substantial evidence.Â  Pruett and Pilgrim both testified that if Blassingame had reported a work-related injury, the Employer would have conducted an investigation.Â  Because of Blassingameâ€™s failure to provide adequate notice of his injury, the Employer was not able to conduct this investigation.Â  We furthermore find substantial evidence to support the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision that Blassingame failed to provide a reasonable excuse for not providing notice.Â  \r\nAs substantial evidence exists in the record to support the findings of the Appellate Panel, the circuit court erred in reversing the Panelâ€™s decision.Â  Accordingly, the order of the circuit court is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â \r\n\r\n [1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-155","title":"Charleston County Department of Social Services v.

At the time Casey was age 9, Ashley was almost 5, and Cody was approximately two and a half.[1]Â  On October 15, 1999, the children were taken into emergency protective custody by Charleston County Department of Social Services (DSS) after the parents were arrested for attempting to pass a fraudulent check at a Wal-Mart and what was identified as a â€œcrack pipeâ€ was found in Pamelaâ€™s purse.Â  \r\nIn a March 20, 2000 order, the family court adopted a treatment plan agreed upon by DSS and the parents.Â  The court required the children to remain in DSS custody until the parents successfully completed a placement plan.Â  Among other things, this plan required substance abuse counseling, parental counseling, and counseling addressing anger management and criminal domestic violence.Â Â  \r\nIn February of 2000, Kenneth and Pamela moved to Hardeeville, South Carolina.Â  Pamela began working toward the completion of her treatment plan.Â  She completed her parenting classes in September of 2000.Â  In February of 2001, she completed a class on relationship issues sponsored by a family violence treatment center.Â  During this time, Pamela paid the child support obligation for approximately six months before beginning to pay it only sporadically.Â  Pamela testified that she paid the child support to the best of her ability.Â  \r\nIn October of 2000, the foster care review board recommended termination of the parental rights of Kenneth and Pamela.Â  Pamela testified that it was at this time she began using cocaine from October of 2000 until June of 2001 due to her despondency over losing her children and at Kennethâ€™s prompting.Â  She acknowledged that she continued using it until June of 2001.Â  In April of 2001, the family court issued a permanence planning order adopting a plan for all three children of termination of parental rights and adoption.Â  In the order, the court noted that there had been some compliance by Pamela but not enough to remedy the situation.Â  It allowed Pamela to continue visitation with the children.\r\nPamela had left Kenneth in February of 2001 and moved to Smoaks, South Carolina to live with her mother and stepfather.Â  She explained, â€œI did a lot of soul searching.Â  I wasnâ€™t happy.Â  I was missing my kids.Â  I realized that I had a loser for a husband who was not helping me to get them back in any way. . . .Â  I just decided to turn my life around.Â  Things just fell into place after I left him.â€Â  In the time since she left Kenneth and moved to Smoaks, her life has greatly improved.Â  She found stable employment and lives with her mother and stepfather.Â  She testified she had not used drugs since June of 2001.Â  In September of 2002, she completed a year-long substance abuse program through drug court.[2]Â  In April of 2002, the guardian ad litem and foster care review board changed their recommendations from termination of parental rights to reunification.Â  Importantly, DSS accepted those recommendations as to Codyâ€™s brother and sister and returned them to Pamela in November of 2002.Â  Casey, one of the children returned to Pamela, is autistic.Â  \r\nWhile Pamela was working toward completion of her treatment plan, the children were living in separate foster homes.Â  Cody was eventually placed with the Shanklin family.Â  He stayed with this foster family for approximately two years, but was removed sometime prior to September of 2001.Â  While Cody was with the Shanklins, his pediatric endocrinologist, Dr. Steven Willi, diagnosed Cody as having psychosocial dwarfism or psychosocial failure to thrive.Â  Dr. Willi explained this condition occurs when a child is not being met with the appropriate nurturing behaviors from some parent or parent surrogate.Â  Mrs. Shanklin testified that when Cody was in their foster care, he initially would become sick after his visitation with Kenneth, Pamela, and his siblings, but this changed after Kenneth no longer participated in the visitations.Â  After that point, Cody â€œlooked forward to going,â€ acted â€œvery lovinglyâ€ toward Pamela, and would play with his mother, siblings, and grandparents.Â  Mrs. Shanklin also testified that during this time she made sure Cody understood that Pamela was his biological mother by placing a picture of his biological family near his bed and allowing him to have letters and cards from them.Â  Cody was removed from the Shanklin household by DSS when Mr. and Mrs. Shanklin temporarily separated, despite Mrs. Shanklinâ€™s desire to continue taking care of him.Â  \r\nWhen Cody was removed from the Shanklinâ€™s foster care, he was temporarily placed in two households before being pre-adoptively placed with Kurtis Kendle and Gayle Kendall (hereinafter the Kendles[3]) in October of 2001.Â  A pre-adoptive placement means the family is being recommended as an adoption home for Cody by DSS.Â  Cody has by all accounts thrived in the Kendle household.\r\nDuring the entire time Cody has been in foster care, Pamela has exercised every visitation offered her.Â Â  Initially visitation was twice a month, but DSS cut the visitation in half.Â  Thus, DSS limited Codyâ€™s visitations with his mother to one hour a month. \r\nThis action for termination of parental rights was filed in May of 2001.Â  DSS originally sought the termination of Pamela and Kennethâ€™s rights to all three children.Â  The Kendles were joined as intervenors in October of 2002.Â  At the hearing, DSS presented the testimony of two expert witnesses to demonstrate that it was in Codyâ€™s best interests to stay with the Kendles.Â  \r\nDr. Elizabeth Ralston, a Ph.D. in clinical psychology and qualified as an expert in family reunification, testified that Cody does not identify Pamela as his natural mother or Casey and Ashley as his natural siblings.Â  However, she testified that based on observation, Pamela is a nurturing and loving mother to her children.Â  Dr. Ralston stated Cody is doing well with the Kendles, but admitted she is unsure if Cody has bonded with the Kendles or whether he is just employing a survival mechanism.Â  Dr. Ralston also testified that Cody is comfortable with Pamela, his siblings, and his grandfather.Â  Her opinion that Cody should remain with the Kendles was rooted in her belief that Cody is thriving with the Kendles and to remove him would be traumatic.Â  However, she acknowledged that when Cody was older and learned that that he had a brother and sister who were returned to their mother when he was not may also be traumatic, but she stated she could not predict the impact such knowledge would have on Cody.Â  \r\nDr. Charles Saylor, a forensic psychologist, testified Cody had resolved his earlier confusion at being placed with the Kendles.Â  He also testified that while Cody knew neither the Shanklins nor the Kendles were his biological parents, he could not identify Pamela as his biological mother.Â  However, Cody could identify Casey and Ashley as his siblings.Â  Dr. Saylor found Cody was â€œin a good home where he is well cared for by . . . parents who are very capable and very devoted to him.â€Â  He concluded it would be in Codyâ€™s best interest to be allowed to continue living with the Kendles and have closure. \r\nOn cross-examination, Dr. Saylor admitted his evaluation did not include the overarching question of whether it is in the best interest of Cody to stay with the Kendles or be reunited with Pamela but was limited to determining whether â€œCody [has] adjusted to life with the Kendles.â€Â  He also admitted that if Pamela could present a nurturing, caring, loving home that would be â€œokayâ€ for Cody.Â  Finally, Dr. Saylor testified Pamelaâ€™s restricted visitation of one hour a month was not enough to create a bond with Cody.Â  \r\nRuth Buck, the guardian ad litem, testified that although she initially recommended termination of parental rights to the court in March of 2001 because she was dissatisfied with the parentsâ€™ progress with their treatment plans, she changed her position to reunification with Pamela in April of 2002.Â  She stated she changed her opinion because (1) Pamela was making progress, (2) Codyâ€™s brother stated he wanted to be returned to Pamela, and (3) Pamela no longer had contact with Kenneth.Â  Buck testified that Pamela â€œnever missed a visit nor did the grandparents.Â  And I continued to see an improvement in the children in their relationship with the mother on the visits over the time.â€Â  Importantly, she testified Pamela was a fit mother and Cody has a good relationship with his brother and sister.Â  Most alarmingly, Buck accused DSS of having reserved Cody for adoption because he was very adoptable.Â  She testified that when she questioned Jacqueline Adams, a DSS adoption specialist, about the Kendlesâ€™ pre-adoptive status, Adams responded, â€œWe donâ€™t get many blue eyed blond children very often, and these people want Cody.â€Â  During her testimony, Adams denied making this statement.Â  \r\nGayle Kendall testified she baby-sits a friendâ€™s twins one day a week at her own house but other than that does not have outside employment.Â  Kurtis Kendle is a homebuilder with an office in their home.Â  They live on the Isle of Palms walking distance from the beach.Â  Gayle Kendall stated they only applied to be pre-adoptive parents and absolutely did not apply to be foster parents.Â  Melissa Turner, a DSS adoption specialist, acknowledged that when Cody was placed with the Kendles, she told them that they could represent themselves as his parents and gave them a Medicaid card with the name Cody Kendle on it.Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In its order, the family court found Buck was biased in favor of Pamela.Â  The family court found grounds for termination had been established in that (1) Pamela had failed to complete her placement plan within six months and was still not in compliance with the placement plan, (2) Pamela had failed to contribute to the support of Cody, and (3) that Cody had been in foster care under the responsibility of the State for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months.Â  In addition, the court found it was in Codyâ€™s best interests to terminate Pamela and Kennethâ€™s parental rights.Â  Pamela appealed the order of the family court.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing a case involving the termination of parental rights, the best interests of the children are always the paramount consideration.Â  Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).Â  Any ground serving as the basis for the termination of parental rights must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Richland County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Earles, 330 S.C. 24, 32, 496 S.E.2d 864, 868 (1998).Â  In reviewing a termination of parental rights, the appellate court has the authority to review the record and make its own findings of whether clear and convincing evidence supports the termination.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Ledford, 357 S.C. 371, 375, 593 S.E.2d 175, 176-177&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nUnder South Carolinaâ€™s termination of parental rights (TPR) statute, â€œ[t]he family court may order the termination of parental rights upon a finding of one or more of the [listed] grounds and a finding that termination is in the best interest of the child.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2004).Â  The family court found three grounds supported termination of Pamelaâ€™s rights.Â  We will address each ground in turn.Â  \r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failure to contribute support\r\nPamela argues the family court erred when it found her failure to contribute child support as a ground for termination.Â  We agree.\r\nA ground for termination of parental rights occurs when the â€œchild has lived outside the home . . . for a period of six months, and during that time the parent has wilfully failed to support the child.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. 20-7-1572(4) (Supp. 2004).Â  The statute explains:Â  \r\n\r\n  Failure to support means the parent has failed to make a material contribution to the childâ€™s care.Â  A material contribution consists of either financial contributions according to the parentâ€™s means or contributions of food, clothing, shelter, or other necessities for the care of the child according to the parentâ€™s means.Â  The court may consider all relevant circumstances in determining whether or not the parent has willfully failed to support the child, including requests for support by the custodian and the ability of the parent to provide support.\r\n\r\nId.Â  Wilfulness is â€œconduct of the parent which evinces a settled purpose to forego parental duties . . .Â  because it manifests a conscious indifference to the rights of the child to receive support and consortium from the parent.â€Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Wilson, 344 S.C. 332, 336, 543 S.E.2d 580, 582 (Ct. App. 2001) (quoting S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. V. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 53, 413 S.E.2d 835, 839 (1992)). â€œWhether a parentâ€™s failure to visit or support a child is wilful is a question of intent to be determined by the facts and circumstances of each case.â€Â  Id.\r\nPamela paid her child support obligation consistently until November of 2000, at which time the payments became sporadic.Â  She explained that at that time she was paying all of the bills for herself and Kenneth, who was not contributing at all.Â  As the family court noted in its order, Pamela also failed to make any payments from June of 2001 to December of 2001.Â  She began making payments again in January of 2002.Â  Pamela stated she made her child support payments the best that she could.Â  \r\nPamela admitted she did not make any payments after June of 2002, but stated it was not a wilful failure to support and that she simply believed she was in compliance with a court order.Â  On June 21, 2002, at DSSâ€™s request, the family court issued an order striking Pamelaâ€™s child support arrearage and closing the case.Â  An October of 2002 consent order vacated the June court order, addressed the future need to recalculate the obligation, and did not require payment until December of 2002.Â  In a further order, dated January 6, 2003, the family court held enforcement of the child support obligation in abeyance until the parental rights hearing.Â  As Casey and Ashley were returned to Pamela in November 2002, revision of the amount of support being paid was needed.Â Â  \r\nPamela made child support payments as she was able and her most recent and substantial failure is explained by her understanding of a court order holding them in abeyance until a final hearing on her parental rights.Â  We find this misunderstanding as to her continued requirement to pay mitigates her failure to provide support and hold it was not wilful.Â  Therefore, we find the family court erred in terminating her rights based on a wilful failure to provide support.\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failure to complete placement plan within six months\r\nPamela argues the court erred in finding her parental rights should be terminated for her failure to complete her placement plan within six months.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œ[F]ailure to comply with DSS treatment plans is not one of the statutory grounds for termination of parental rights in this state.â€Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Lail, 335 S.C. 284, 294, 516 S.E.2d 463, 468 (Ct. App. 1999) overruled on other grounds by Joiner v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 109, 536 S.E.2d 372, 375 (2000) (overruling prior cases calling for strict construction of the TPR statutes).Â  Instead, the TPR statute allows for termination if the parent has not remedied the conditions which caused the removal within six months following the adoption of a placement plan.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(2) (Supp. 2004).\r\nThe family court found Cody was removed from Pamelaâ€™s custody because he faced a substantial risk of harm.Â  The court found this substantial risk was a â€œcomplete lack of stability existing in the King family at the time of removal.â€Â  The court specifically commented on the transient nature of the King family.Â  However, at the time of the hearing, Pamela had stable living arrangements in her mother and stepfatherâ€™s home and stable employment.Â  Thus, we find the conditions that caused the removal have changed for the better.\r\nFurthermore, the guardian ad litem testified that Pamela had completed the requirements of the placement plan.Â  Pamelaâ€™s actions demonstrate substantial compliance with her placement plan.Â  A final order dated March 17, 2000, required Pamela to complete substance abuse counseling, counseling with the Lowcountry Childrenâ€™s Center, and other counseling that is not specifically defined.Â  A May 17, 2000 order required Pamela to complete substance abuse counseling, undergo a psychological evaluation, and anger management or criminal domestic abuse violence intervention.Â  A September 1, 2000 order required parental effectiveness training, substance abuse counseling, and undefined counseling.Â  \r\nPamela completed substance abuse counseling on April 10, 2002 and Systematic Training for Effective Parenting on September 13, 2000, and received a Diploma in Relationship Issues from the Family Violence Treatment Center on February 20, 2001.Â  In April of 2000 she went to Coastal Empire Mental Health for counseling, but she told her counselor that everything was fine in her life and she did not want mental health services.Â  Her counselor interpreted this as a refusal of services.Â  However, Pamela later returned in February of 2001 to Coastal Empire Mental Health and continued in some sort of counseling until June 2001.Â  We find Pamela did substantially complete all of the requirements ordered by the court.\r\nThis finding is supported by the very actions and testimony of DSS.Â  DSS returned Codyâ€™s brother and sisterÂ  to Pamela, even though one is autistic.Â  This would suggest that DSS considered her as having completed the requirements of the placement plan and having remedied the instability that had caused the childrenâ€™s removal.Â  It is also supported by the actual testimony of her DSS caseworker.Â  Louvette Green testified that Pamela was in compliance.Â  However, Green then proceeded to recant and say Pamela did not finish her counseling.Â  While Mr. Kavolanchik from Coastal Empire Mental Counseling stated Pamela dropped out of counseling after six months, the actual duration of counseling ordered by the court was unspecified and we cannot find that Pamela was not in substantial compliance.Â  See generally Lail, 335 S.C. at 294, 516 S.E.2d at 468 (â€œThus, while the motherâ€™s efforts to comply fully with DSS treatment plans were less than whole-hearted, the motherâ€™s attitude toward DSS is understandable given the chain of events that precipitated the dissolution of the Lail family. Such an attitude, without more, does not mandate the solution sought by DSS in this case.â€).Â  Thus we find termination on the grounds of non-compliance was in error.Â  \r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foster care of fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months\r\nIn a fairly recent amendment, the TPR statute provides as a ground for termination:Â  â€œThe child has been in foster care under the responsibility of the State for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(8) (Supp. 2004).Â  There is no question Cody has been in foster care under the responsibility of the state since October of 1999.Â  Thus, we find no error in the family courtâ€™s finding that this ground has been established.Â  However, we reiterate that this is the only ground DSS established by clear and convincing evidence to support termination of Pamelaâ€™s rights to Cody.Â  \r\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Best interests of the child\r\nAlthough we find one ground for termination does exist, we must also determine whether termination would be in Codyâ€™s best interests.Â  We find it is not.Â  \r\nOur legislature has provided, â€œThe interests of the child shall prevail if the childâ€™s interest and the parental rights conflict.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578 (Supp. 2004).Â  However it is still â€œ[t]he public policy of this state in child custody matters is to reunite parents and children.â€ Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 296, 513 S.E.2d 358, 366 (1999); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-20 (1985).Â  The supreme court has recognized a childâ€™s shared interest in preventing an erroneous termination of her familial bond with her natural parent.Â  Greenville County Depâ€™t Soc. Servs. v. Bowes, 313 S.C. 188, 196, 437 S.E.2d 107, 111 (1993).Â  Furthermore, while there is a presumption that it is in the best interest of a child to be in the custody of its biological parent, such a presumption is rebuttable.Â  Shake v. Darlington County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 306 S.C. 216, 222, 410 S.E.2d 923, 926 (Ct. App. 1991) (citingÂ  Moore v. Moore, 300 S.C. 75, 79, 386 S.E.2d 456, 458 (1989)). \r\nThe family court found it would be in the best interests of Cody for Pamelaâ€™s parental rights to be terminated.Â  This was partially based on the fact it was â€œundisputed that the child is safe and well cared-for by the [Kendles] and is emotionally attached to [them].â€Â  The court refused to apply the factors set forth in Moore v. Moore, 300 S.C. 75, 386 S.E.2d 456 (1989). \r\nThe Moore factors are to be used â€œwhen a natural parent seeks to reclaim custody of [her] child.â€Â  Id. at 79, 386 S.E.2d at 458.Â  These factors require the court to consider the following:Â  (1) whether the parent can prove he or she is a fit parent, able to properly care for the child and provide a good home; (2) the amount of contact, in the form of visits, financial support or both, which the parent had with the child while in the care of a third party; (3) the circumstances under which temporary relinquishment occurred; and (4) the degree of attachment between the child and the temporary custodian.Â  Id.Â  at 79-80, 386 S.E.2d at 458.Â  \r\nThe family court refused to consider these criteria because Moore involved a private custody action, voluntary relinquishment, and the application of a rebuttable presumption that it is in the best interest of a child to be in the custody of its biological parent.Â  However, we find application of the Moore factors is not limited to voluntary relinquishment cases.Â  This court applied the Moore factors in Shake v. Darlington County Depâ€™t of Soc. Serv., 306 S.C. 216, 410 S.E.2d 923 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  In Shake, the natural parents voluntarily relinquished custody of the child when he was a month old due to the childâ€™s failure to thrive.Â Â  At that time he was placed in the care of the foster mother.Â  When the child was five months old, he was returned to his natural parents, but a month later, DSS sought and procured an emergency protective custody order at which time he was placed back in the care of the foster mother.Â  Up until the time of the hearing on this matter four years later, the child had remained in the continuous care of the foster mother.Â  The foster mother brought the action seeking termination of natural parentsâ€™ rights to the child.Â  The family court denied the termination and granted custody to the natural mother.Â  On appeal, this court affirmed the denial of termination of parental rights, but applied the Moore factors to hold custody should be returned to the foster mother.Â  Similarly, the supreme court applied the Moore factors in an action to terminate a fatherâ€™s parental rights brought by a childâ€™s guardian ad litem following removal of the child from the natural mother and placement of the child with foster parents who wanted to adopt him.Â  Hopkins v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Serv., 313 S.C. 322, 437 S.E.2d 542 (1993) overruled on other grounds by Joiner v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 109, 536 S.E.2d 372, 375 (2000) (overruling prior cases calling for strict construction of the TPR statutes).Â  Thus, the appellate courts have applied the Moore factors in cases involving DSS removal of children.Â  Furthermore, the Kendle family has intervened in this case as the pre-adoptive foster family, similar to the foster motherâ€™s initiation of the action in Shake.Â  Accordingly, we will consider the Moore factors as guidance in determining whether termination of Pamelaâ€™s parental rights is in Codyâ€™s best interest.Â Â Â  \r\nÂ  Pamelaâ€™s fitness as a parent cannot be questioned.Â  She has improved her life and provided a stable family environment for Codyâ€™s brother and sister.Â  For DSS to argue Pamela is an unfit parent would require it to argue that it improperly returned the two children to her.Â  Furthermore, Louvette Green agreed that â€œ[w]hat [this case] boils down to is Cody, himself, and only Cody, has become attached to the Kendles and that is the issue DSS is having before the court today.â€Â  \r\nSecond, Pamela has had continuous contact with Cody.Â  Although DSS limited her to one hour a month with her son, Pamela took advantage of every visitation offered and begged for more time with him.Â Â Â  See generally Greenville County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Bowes, 313 S.C. 188, 195, 437 S.E.2d 107, 111 (1993) (noting that the â€œState marshals an array of public resources and has the power to shape the historical events that from the basis of terminationâ€ and that DSS â€œhad contributed to the lack of bonding between Mother and her child.â€).Â  Furthermore, Pamela has provided some financial support.Â  \r\nFor the third factor, custody was relinquished because the instability in Pamelaâ€™s life posed a threat of harm to the children.Â  However, she has altered her lifestyle and it no longer presents an obstacle in this case.Â  \r\nAs to the final factor, there is no question that Cody is thriving in the Kendlesâ€™ home.Â  However, Dr. Ralston could not state if Cody had bonded or was simply employing a survival technique.Â  \r\nFurthermore, testimony demonstrates Cody is a resilient child who has a relationship with Pamela, his brother and sister, and grandparents.Â  If returned to Pamela, Cody would not only have the love, support, and care of his natural mother, but also of these other family members.Â  Pamela testified that Codyâ€™s brother and sister miss him and write him letters, which they cannot send.Â  Buck testified that during visitations Cody and his brother and sister played together and were very close.\r\nIn this case, our focus centers on what is in the best interests for Cody.Â  We are concerned by the length of time Pamela took in completing her treatment plan while her children remained in DSS custody.Â  However, it was after Pamela had turned her life around and rededicated herself to completing her treatment plan that DSS took action to place Cody with preadoptive parents.Â  Although Pamela had not had a positive drug test since June of 2001 and was enrolled in a substance abuse and counseling program that would fulfill the requirements of her plan, DSS placed Cody with the Kendles in October of 2001.Â  Only six months after Cody was placed with the Kendles, the Foster Care Review Board changed its recommendation from termination of parental rights to reunification with Pamela within six months.Â  Despite this recommendation, DSS continued to pursue termination while Cody remained with the Kendles in a preadoptive placement.Â  There is no question that, at the very latest, when Codyâ€™s brother and sister were returned to her, Pamela was a fit parent capable of caring for Cody.Â  \r\n\r\n  Keeping the best interest of Cody as our paramount concern, we conclude that Codyâ€™s interests would be served best by denying termination of parental rights. \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n    \r\n\r\nFor the reasons discussed above, we find the family court erred in terminating the parental rights of Pamela King to her son Cody King. \r\nREVERSED.\r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â \r\n\r\n[1] Casey was born June 17, 1990, Ashley was born November 17, 1994, and Cody was born March 24, 1997.Â  \r\n[2] In September 2001, Pamela entered drug court as a result of criminal charges that arose from her employment when she lived in Hardeeville.\r\n[3] Although the Kendles filed their motion to intervene under the pseudonyms John Roe and Mary Roe, they used their real names at the hearing.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-156","title":"In the Interest Of:  S.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Deborah R. J. Shupe; all of Columbia; and Solicitor Warren Blair Giese, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Damion S. pled guilty in family court to first-degree burglary, safecracking, grand larceny, and two counts of second-degree burglary.Â  On appeal, he argues the family court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to accept his pleas because the juvenile petitions were insufficient.Â  We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.\r\nBACKGROUND\r\nThe juvenile petitions against Damion alleged he was involved in break-ins at three separate homes.Â  The first-degree burglary petition involved an incident at the home of Matt Ragen.Â  The safecracking, grand larceny, and one of the second-degree burglary allegations arose from a break-in at the home of Jimmie Coward.Â  The remaining second-degree burglary charge and a nol prossed petit larceny charge concerned a break-in at the home of June Williford.Â  \r\nThe family court accepted Damionâ€™s guilty pleas, adjudicated him delinquent, and later sentenced him to an indeterminate period not to exceed his twenty-first birthday.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe court of general sessions has jurisdiction over a criminal case where there is an indictment sufficiently stating the offense, the offense is a lesser-included offense of the indicted offense, or the defendant waives presentment of the indictment.Â  Cohen v. State, 354 S.C. 563, 565-66, 582 S.E.2d 403, 404 (2003).Â  An indictment is sufficient for jurisdictional purposes where it â€œapprises the defendant of the elements of the offense intended to be charged and informs [him] of the circumstances he must be prepared to defend.â€Â  Koon v. State, 358 S.C. 359, 365, 595 S.E.2d 456, 459 (2004).Â  This court has previously applied the rules governing indictments to a juvenile petition, citing due process rights applicable in both arenas.Â  In the Interest of Jason T., 340 S.C. 455, 458-59, 531 S.E.2d 544, 545-46 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œBased on the due process protections governing juvenile proceedings and the exemplary procedure employed in courts of general sessions to preserve adultsâ€™ due process rights, we now hold that a family court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate a juvenile delinquent for a charge not alleged in the juvenile petition unless the adjudication is for a lesser included offense or there has been a written waiver of notice.â€).\r\nI.Â  First-Degree Burglary Petition\r\nA person commits first-degree burglary where he enters a dwelling without consent and with the intent to commit a crime therein, and one of the statutorily defined aggravating circumstances is present.[1]Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(A) (2003).Â  In State v. Lynch, the State moved at the outset of a murder and first-degree burglary trial to amend the burglary indictment by deleting one aggravating circumstance and replacing it with another.Â  State v. Lynch, 344 S.C. 635, 638, 545 S.E.2d 511, 513 (2001).Â  Following his conviction on both charges, our supreme court reversed his burglary conviction, concluding the amendment impermissibly changed the nature of the offense charged.Â  Id. at 640-41, 545 S.E.2d at 514.Â  The court noted without the aggravating circumstance, the crime would be second-degree burglary and thus although it is but one element of the crime, â€œthe aggravating circumstance is â€˜the essenceâ€™ of first degree burglary.â€Â  Id. at 640, 545 S.E.2d at 514 (quoting State v. Sowell, 85 S.C. 278, 67 S.E. 316 (1910).Â  Because the aggravating circumstances involved were distinct and required materially different proof, the court held the amendment struck the charged offense and replaced it with an entirely different one and thus deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Id. at 640-41, 545 S.E.2d at 514.Â  \r\nCiting Lynch, our supreme court has since held the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to convict a defendant of first-degree burglary where the indictment failed to allege any one of the several aggravating circumstances set forth in the statute.Â  Mathis v. State, 355 S.C. 87, 92, 584 S.E.2d 366, 368-69 (2003); see also Browning v. State, 320 S.C. 366, 369, 465 S.E.2d 358, 359 (1995) (holding circuit court lacked jurisdiction to accept second-degree burglary guilty plea where the indictment failed to allege any circumstance of aggravation).\r\nIn this case, the purported first-degree burglary petition fails to allege any circumstance of aggravation.Â  The State, however, points out the petition alleges that after waiving his rights, Damion confessed to the crime of first-degree burglary.Â  We need not decide whether such an incorporation would suffice for jurisdictional purposes because the confession referenced also contains no hint of any aggravating circumstance.Â  The State also notes Damion did not challenge the Stateâ€™s factual recitation, in which the prosecutor asserted the offense occurred during the hours of darkness, thus asserting an aggravating circumstance was present.Â  This argument fails to recognize the charging document itself serves as the focus of our jurisdictional analysis.Â  Although the sufficiency of an indictment is to be viewed with a practical eye considering all surrounding circumstances, this evaluation is to be based on pre-trial surrounding circumstances, not information related during a guilty plea hearing.Â  See State v. Wade, 306 S.C. 79, 86, 409 S.E.2d 780, 784 (1991) (rejecting dissentâ€™s attempt to include evidence presented at trial as surrounding circumstances available for consideration in evaluating sufficiency of an indictment).Â  Because the petition fails to allege any aggravating circumstance, we vacate Damionâ€™s delinquency adjudication for first-degree burglary.\r\nII.Â  Remaining Petitions\r\nWe affirm Damionâ€™s remaining issues pursuant to Rule 220(b)(2), SCACR and the following authorities:Â  Browning, 320 S.C. at 368, 465 S.E.2d at 359 (â€œAn indictment is sufficient if the offense is stated with sufficient certainty and particularity to enable the court to know what judgment to pronounce, and the defendant to know what he is called upon to answer and whether he may plead an acquittal or conviction thereon.â€); Id. (â€œThe true test of the sufficiency of an indictment is not whether it could be made more definite and certain, but whether it contains the necessary elements of the offense intended to be charged and sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet.â€); State v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 130, 437 S.E.2d 75, 78 (1993) (holding question of sufficiency of an indictment must be viewed â€œwith a practical eye in view of the surrounding circumstancesâ€); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-312 (2003) (defining second-degree burglary); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-390 (2003) (defining safecracking); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-30(B) (2003) (defining grand larceny). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe vacate Damionâ€™s adjudication on the offense of first-degree burglary and affirm his adjudication on the remaining charges.Â  Because we have vacated his adjudication as to the most serious offense, we remand to the family court for any reconsideration of his sentence deemed appropriate as a consequence of this opinion. \r\n AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.Â  \r\n HUFF, J., concurs.\r\n GOOLSBY, J., dissents in part and concurs in part in a separate opinion.\r\nGOOLSBY, J. (dissenting in part and concurring in part): I dissent to the extent the majority vacates on the ground of lack of subject matter jurisdiction the appellantâ€™s adjudication of delinquency for having committed the offense of first-degree burglary and remands appellant to the family court for resentencing.Â  I otherwise concur.\r\nViewing, as we must, the allegations of first-degree burglary set forth in the petition with a â€œpractical eyeâ€ and taking note of all surrounding circumstances that existed pre-trial, I would hold the petition was sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction upon the family court to adjudicate those allegations.Â  See State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003); State v. McCloud, 354 S.C. 40, 579 S.E.2d 534 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The petition says the juvenile along with another â€œforced entry into the residenceâ€ in question, they searched for money once inside, and the juvenile confessed â€œto the crime of burglary 1st,â€ which is no different than had the petition expressly referenced the burglary statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311 (A) (2003).Â  His confessionÂ  states he and another person â€œgot a lot of change and some jewelryâ€ after they got inside the house. \r\nIf the appellant had a question about which aggravating circumstance the State intended to rely upon, he should have raised this issue earlier by motion.Â  See Rule 12(e), SCRCP; Rule 2(b), SCRFC; cf. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-90 (Rev. 2003).Â  This he did not do.Â  He should not now be heard to complain.\r\nI would affirm.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  Section 16-11-311(A) provides:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        (A)&nbsp;\r\n         A person is guilty of burglary in the first degree if the person enters a dwelling without consent and with intent to commit a crime in the dwelling, and either:\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (1)&nbsp;\r\n         when, in effecting entry or while in the dwelling or in immediate flight, he or another participant in the crime:\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (a)&nbsp;\r\n         is armed with a deadly weapon or explosive; or\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (b)&nbsp;\r\n        causes physical injury to a person who is not a participant in the crime; or\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (c)\r\n         uses or threatens the use of a dangerous instrument; or\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (d)&nbsp;\r\n         displays what is or appears to be a knife, pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun, or other firearm; or\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (2)&nbsp;\r\n        &nbsp;the burglary is committed by a person with a prior record of two or more convictions for burglary or housebreaking or a combination of both; or\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (3)Â Â Â Â \r\n        &nbsp;the entering or remaining occurs in the nighttime.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-157","title":"State v.

Myers, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nHarry Clayton DePew, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Central Carolina Christian Academy (â€œthe Academyâ€) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order denying its motion to set aside the default judgment entered in favor of Charles Jenkins d/b/a Jenkins Produce (Jenkins).Â  We affirm.[1]  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn October 30, 1996, Jenkins and the Academy entered into a contract whereby Jenkins agreed to sell produce to the Academy for an agreed upon price of $51,468.75, which was payable on December 13, 1996.Â  Because the Academy failed to pay for the produce, Jenkins filed an action for breach of contract on April 1, 1997.Â  An affidavit of service indicates the action was served upon â€œMs. Jamesâ€ on April 7, 1997.Â  The affidavit does not list an address or Ms. Jamesâ€™s position at the Academy.Â  Instead, one line on the affidavit is marked that Ms. James is â€œ[a] person of suitable age and discretion residing with the Plaintiffs (Â  ) / Defendants (Â  ).â€Â  Receiving no response from the Academy, Jenkins filed an affidavit of default on September 2, 1997.Â  Â Â  \r\nOn July 7, 1998, the circuit court entered a default judgment in the amount of $51,528.75 against the Academy.Â  Jenkinsâ€™s attorney mailed a copy of the judgment to the Academy on July 15, 1998.Â  Because the Academy failed to respond, Jenkinsâ€™s attorney again informed the Academy, via certified mail dated September 28, 2001, about the outstanding judgment.Â  Although Mr. Theodore Myers, the Headmaster of the Academy, signed the certified letter there was no response to the judgment. \r\nIn December 2001, Jenkins filed an execution against the property of the Academy to satisfy the judgment.Â  By letter dated December 31, 2001, the Richland County Sheriffâ€™s Department indicated that it had complied with the required regulations in terms of checking property records and attempting to contact the Academy.\r\nOn April 22, 2002, Jenkins filed a rule to show cause and an order of reference.Â  The circuit court judge signed the order of reference and a hearing was set before the master for August 26, 2002.Â  This document was filed on July 16, 2002. \r\nIn response, the Academy filed a motion to set aside the default judgment on August 22, 2002.Â  In its motion, the Academy alleged that Jenkins had failed to properly serve the Academy pursuant to Rule 4(d)(3) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.[2]Â  Specifically, the Academy asserted that service upon â€œMs. Jamesâ€ was insufficient to provide it with notice of the suit because the Academy had never employed an agent by the name of Ms. James.Â  Although the Academy admitted that it â€œbecame aware of the existence of the default judgment in either 2000 or 2001,â€ it contended that it was never â€œafforded an opportunity to defend this suit on the meritsâ€ and was â€œnever notified of a hearing to ascertain damages as required by South Carolina law.â€\r\nAs a result of the Academyâ€™s motion, the master continued the case until the circuit court could rule on the jurisdictional issue raised by the Academy.Â  On January 9, 2003, the circuit court judge held a hearing on the Academyâ€™s motion to set aside the default judgment.Â  By order dated March 12, 2003, the judge denied the Academyâ€™s motion, finding:Â  (1). service of process was sufficient because Jenkins properly served the Academy, which was the name listed on the contract at issue, and Jenkins was, thus, not required to serve the parent corporation of South Richland Ministries, Incorporated; (2). the Academy was not entitled to notice prior to the damages hearing given the requested relief was a sum certain; and (3). the Academy failed to avail itself of the relief outlined under Rule 60(b)(4) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure since it did not move to set aside the default judgment within a â€œreasonable timeâ€ after it was notified of the entry of the judgment.[3]Â  In his order denying the Academyâ€™s motion for reconsideration, the judge reaffirmed his ruling that the Academy had failed to move to set aside the entry of the default judgment within a â€œreasonable timeâ€ as required by Rule 60(b)(4).Â  This appeal follows.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Academy argues the circuit court judge erred in finding the jurisdictional requirement of service of process was satisfied.Â  In support of its argument, the Academy asserts that even if the summons and complaint had been served on Ms. James, she was not a proper party because she was not an agent.Â  Additionally, the Academy claims that Jenkins could not cure the insufficient service of process by notifying the Academy after the default judgment had been entered.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA party seeking to set aside a judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b) has the burden of presenting evidence entitling him to the requested relief.â€Â  Perry v. Heirs at law of Gadsen, 357 S.C. 42, 46-47, 590 S.E.2d 502, 504 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The decision of whether to grant or deny a Rule 60(b) motion is within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Id. at 47, 590 S.E.2d at 504.Â  â€œOn review, we are limited to determining whether the trial court abused its discretion in granting or denying such a motion.â€Â  Id.\r\nBecause the Academyâ€™s motion to set aside the default judgment was based on Jenkinsâ€™s alleged failure to properly effectuate service as required by Rule 4(d)(3), SCRCP, the Academyâ€™s requested relief was governed by Rule 60(b)(4).Â  Roche v. Young Bros., Inc. of Florence, 318 S.C. 207, 209, 456 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1995) (â€œRule 4, SCRCP serves at least two purposes.Â  It confers personal jurisdiction on the court and assures the defendant of reasonable notice of the action.â€); Brown v. Carolina Emergency Physicians, P.A., 348 S.C. 569, 583-84, 560 S.E.2d 624, 631 (Ct. App. 2001) (stating in order for service upon a corporation to be effective, it must be made on an actual agent).Â  \r\nRule 60(b)(4) permits relief from judgment if the judgment is void.Â  Smith Cos. of Greenville v. Hayes, 311 S.C. 358, 360, 428 S.E.2d 900, 902 (Ct. App. 1993); Rule 60(b)(4), SCRCP (â€œOn motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: . . . (4) the judgment is void.â€).Â  â€œThe definition of â€˜voidâ€™ under the rule only encompasses judgments from courts which failed to provide due process, or judgments from courts which lacked subject matter jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction.â€Â  McDaniel v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., 324 S.C. 639, 644, 478 S.E.2d 868, 871 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nUnder Rule 60(b)(4), â€œthe court may grant a party relief from judgment if the party makes a motion seeking relief within a reasonable time.â€ Smith Cos. of Greenville, 311 S.C. at 359, 428 S.E.2d at 902; see McDaniel, 324 S.C. at 642-44, 478 S.E.2d at 870-71 (applying â€œreasonable timeâ€ requirement to motion pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4), but recognizing inconsistency among the decisions of South Carolina appellate courts, other state courts, and federal courts as to whether requirement should be imposed to challenge a judgment as void). \r\nBased on the evidence presented in the record, we find the circuit court judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the Academyâ€™s motion to set aside the entry of the default judgment.Â  The default judgment was entered on July 7, 1998, and copy mailed to the Academy on July 15, 1998.Â  On September 28, 2001, Jenkins notified the Academy about the judgment by certified mail.Â  Mr. Theodore Myers, the Headmaster of the Academy, signed that he received this letter.Â  Furthermore, the Academy admitted in its motion that its â€œprincipals became aware of the existence of the default judgment either in 2000 or 2001,â€ yet it did not file its motion to set aside the default judgment until August 22, 2002, four days before the hearing scheduled on Jenkinsâ€™s motion for a rule to show cause.Â  Based on the foregoing, we find there is evidence to support the judgeâ€™s ruling that the Academy failed to make its motion within a â€œreasonable time.â€Â  See McDaniel, 324 S.C. at 644, 478 S.E.2d at 871 (finding Rule 60(b)(4) motion untimely where party filed it nearly four years after order enforcing settlement agreement was filed).Â  Therefore, even assuming arguendo that the judgment was void for insufficient service of process, the Academyâ€™s delay in moving to set aside the default judgment precluded it from receiving any relief under Rule 60(b)(4).\r\nAccordingly, the decision of the circuit court judge is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â Â  Rule 4(d)(3) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides:\r\n\r\nThe summons and complaint must be served together. The plaintiff shall furnish the person making service with such copies as are necessary. Voluntary appearance by defendant is equivalent to personal service; and written notice of appearance by a party or his attorney shall be effective upon mailing, or may be served as provided in this rule. Service shall be made as follows:\r\n. . . \r\nUpon a corporation or upon a partnership or other unincorporated association which is subject to suit under a common name, by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to an officer, a managing or general agent, or to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process and if the agent is one authorized by statute to receive service and the statute so requires, by also mailing a copy to the defendant.\r\n\r\n[3]Â Â  Although the Academy moved to set aside the default judgment pursuant to Rule 55(c), the circuit court judge properly analyzed the motion pursuant to Rule 60(b) on the ground the default judgment had already been entered. See Rule 55(c), SCRCP (â€œFor good cause shown the court may set aside an entry of default and, if a judgment by default has been entered, may likewise set it aside in accordance with Rule 60(b).â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-160","title":"Smiley v.

Victor Rawl, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-160Â Â Â \r\nHeard February 9, 2005 â€“ Filed March 7, 2005 \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAmy Elizabeth Armstrong and James S. Chandler, Jr., both of Pawleyâ€™s Island, for Appellant.\r\nKenneth Krawcheck and Leslie West Stidham, both of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  James Smiley appeals from the circuit courtâ€™s judicial review of the Coastal Zone Management Appellate Panel, which affirmed the Appellate Panel, finding that Smiley lacked standing to appeal a permit issued by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (â€œDHEC/OCRMâ€).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\n    In February 2001, DHEC/OCRM issued a critical area permit authorizing the Wild Dunes Community Association to excavate 25,000 cubic yards of sand each month from the intertidal beach of Isle of Palms and to transport it to private property owned by Wild Dunes.Â  The permit provided that the depth of the excavation would not exceed 18 inches and imposed other special conditions.\r\n    Smiley lives on the Isle of Palms and has been actively involved in the conservation and protection of the beach and dune system on the island.Â  Also, Smiley uses the beach for recreational and rehabilitative purposes.Â  Smiley sought to have the Administrative Law Judge set aside the permit because he alleged the excavation would interfere with his use of the beach.Â  \r\n    Before the hearing on the merits, DHEC/OCRM filed a motion to dismiss for lack of standing, asserting Smiley could not demonstrate the requisite injury.Â  The Administrative Law Judge determined Smiley lacked standing and dismissed the case.Â  The Coastal Zone Management Appellate Panel affirmed the dismissal and the circuit court affirmed the administrative rulings.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\nREVIEW\r\n        In reviewing the final decision of an administrative agency, the circuit court essentially sits as an appellate court to review alleged errors committed by the agency.Â  Brown v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health and Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 519, 560 S.E.2d 410, 417 (2002).Â  â€œOur scope of review is the same as that established for the circuit court.â€Â  Id. at 512, 560 S.E.2d at 413.\r\n        â€œWe must affirm if the decision of the agency is supported by substantial evidence, and we may not substitute our judgment for that of the agency upon questions as to which there is room for a difference of intelligent opinion.â€Â  Byerly Hosp. v. South Carolina State Health &amp; Human Serv. Fin. Commâ€™n, 319 S.C. 225, 229, 460 S.E.2d 383, 385-86 (1995).Â  Substantial evidence is â€œevidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached.â€Â  Rodney v. Michelin Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 515, 519, 466 S.E.2d 357, 359 (1996).\r\n        LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n        I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing\r\n\r\nSmiley argues the\r\ncircuit court erred in finding he lacked standing to contest the permit issued\r\nto Wild Dunes.We disagree.\r\n \r\n\r\n        To have standing, a plaintiff must satisfy a three-part test consisting of the following elements: (1) the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact; (2) there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of; and (3) a favorable decision must be likely to redress the injury.Â  Sea Pines Assâ€™n for Prot. of Wildlife, Inc. v. South Carolina Dept. of Natural Res., 345 S.C. 594, 601, 550 S.E.2d 287, 291 (2001).Â  The injury in fact must be concrete and particularized, as well as actual or imminent.Â  Id.Â  The â€œimminent prejudice must be of a personal nature to the party laying claim to standing and not merely of general interest common to all members of the public.â€Â  Citizens for Lee County, Inc. v. Lee County, 308 S.C. 23, 29, 416 S.E.2d 641, 645 (1992).Â  A plaintiff must allege facts that demonstrate how he or she personally will be prevented from enjoying the land or wildlife in question to have standing to maintain an action.Â  Sea Pines, 345 S.C. at 602, 550 S.E.2d at 292.Â  A mere interest in a problem, rather than a real injury, does not give rise to standing.Â  Beaufort Realty Co. v. Beaufort County, 346 S.C. 298, 301, 551 S.E.2d 588, 589 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\n          This case focuses on the first element of the three-part testâ€”the injury in fact.Â  Although Smiley alleges the excavation will harm his use and enjoyment of the beach, he has failed to demonstrate the injury is actual or imminent because the permit simply authorizes the excavation, which has not occurred.Â \r\n       \r\n            In Beaufort Realty, 346 S.C. at 302, 551 S.E.2d at 590, we held the filing of plats was not an actionable injury because the injury had not yet occurred and was purely conjectural and hypothetical.Â  Cf. Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp., 204 F.3d 149, 156 (4th Cir. 2000) (finding standing when the plaintiffs had already suffered damage); Am. Canoe Assâ€™n v. Murphy Farms, Inc., 326 F.3d 505, 520 (4th Cir. 2003) (finding standing where the particularized injury had already occurred).Â  \r\n            Furthermore, Smiley has failed to demonstrate how the proposed project will prevent his enjoyment of the beach.Â  The permit allows for only a limited removal of sand on a portion of the beach.Â  Thus, if the excavation occurs, Smileyâ€™s use and enjoyment of the beach will only be temporarily altered.Â  His injury, at best, will be a temporary detour in his jogging route and does not compare to the permanent injury in South Carolina Wildlife Fedâ€™n v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 296 S.C. 187, 190, 371 S.E.2d 521, 523 (1988), where the plaintiffs were found to have standing because the parties alleged the decision of the Coastal Council would permanently change the fish and wildlife resources in the wetlands.Â  However, even a permanent injury does not assure a plaintiff will have standing.Â  In Sea Pines, the complained-of activity would permanently destroy wildlife, yet our Supreme Court found the plaintiffs lacked standing.Â  Certainly, if the permanent injury in Sea Pines did not warrant standing, Smileyâ€™s temporary inconvenience does not give rise to standing.\r\n            Smiley also seems to assert he has standing because he has a legally protected right that will be violated by the removal of sand.Â  Section 48-39-260(1) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004) provides the State has a responsibility to â€œprotect, preserve, restore, and enhance the beach/dune system.â€Â  Thus, the State cannot allow activity that â€œsubstantially impairs the public interest in marine life, water quality, or public access.â€Â  McQueen v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 354 S.C. 142, 149, 580 S.E.2d 116, 120 (2003).Â  Furthermore, the Public Trust Doctrine is based on the premise that â€œsome things are too important in society to be owned by one personâ€ and â€œeveryone has the inalienable right to breathe clean air; to drink safe water; to fish and sail, and recreate upon the high seas, territorial seas and navigable waters; as well as to land on the seashores and riverbanks.â€Â  Sierra Club v. Kiawah Resort Assoc., 318 S.C. 119, 127-28, 456 S.E.2d 397, 402 (1995).Â Â Â  However, Section 48-39-260(4) and (5) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004) also provides the State policy is to â€œencourage the use of erosion-inhabiting techniques which do not adversely impact the long-term well-being of the beach/dune systemâ€ and â€œpromote carefully planned nourishment as a means of beach preservation and restoration where economically feasible.â€Â  The excavation of sand does not substantially impair the public interest and is within the Stateâ€™s policy of preserving and restoring its beaches, thus Smiley has failed to demonstrate how the permit would violate these protections. \r\n            II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Administrative Law Judge\r\n            Smiley argues the preceding tribunals applied the incorrect standard in deciding the motion to dismiss.[1]Â  Smiley asserts the ALJ should have viewed the facts and inferences in a light most favorable to him; however, the Administrative Procedures Act determines the standard the ALJ is to apply to this case.Â  In a contested case, a hearing before the ALJ is in the nature of a de novo hearing as mandated by the Administrative Procedures Act.Â  Reliance Ins. Co. v. Smith, 327 S.C. 528, 534, 489 S.E.2d 674, 677 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Cf.Â  Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 376-77, 527 S.E.2d 742, 754 (2000) (finding the ALJ sits in an appellate capacity to review non-collateral or administrative final decisions).Â  Following the mandates of the APA, the ALJ did not commit reversible error in the standard applied to the facts of the case.\r\n            Smiley also contends the ALJ did not properly address the merits of his appeal.Â  Smiley suggests the ALJ mischaracterized the project and determined it would benefit him, and, thus, decided he lacked standing.Â  However, Smiley misconstrues the ALJâ€™s analysis, which explained Smileyâ€™s aesthetic concerns about a temporary interference did not present evidence of a concrete or particularized injury.\r\n            AFFIRMED. \r\nANDERSON, BEATTY, SHORT, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] Smileyâ€™s arguments are limited to a discussion of the ALJ, thus we limit our analysis accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-161","title":"Tench v.

Churdar, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nAndrew F. Lindemann, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Gary Tench (Appellant), as Conservator for Jason Tench, appeals from an order finding the accrual of post-judgment interest ceased when the South Carolina Department of Education (Respondent) paid its judgment obligation.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS \r\n    This action arose from a motor vehicle accident on October 6, 1994, in which eighteen-year-old Jason Tench was seriously and permanently injured when a school bus operated by the Respondent pulled in front of his vehicle.Â  Jasonâ€™s father, Appellant, brought suit against Respondent for Jasonâ€™s bodily injuries and medical expenses.Â  In addition to a $250,000 payment to Jason, on September 20, 1996, Respondent was ordered to pay $250,000 to Appellant.[2]Â  After a complex procedural stage, our Supreme Court reinstated the September 20, 1996 judgment by order filed October 1, 2001.[3]Â  After remand, a dispute arose as to whether post-judgment interest commenced on September 20, 1996 or October 1, 2001, when the original order was reinstated.Â  An order filed on December 4, 2001 determined that the accrual of post-judgment interest commenced on September 20, 1996.[4]Â  On that same date, Respondent delivered a check for $250,000 to Appellantâ€™s counsel, which was accepted.Â  As of December 4, 2001, the post-judgment interest that had accrued since September 20, 1996 totaled $182,191.75.Â  In 2003, Respondent paid Appellant $182,191.75.Â  Appellant maintains that he is entitled to additional post-judgment interest from December 4, 2001 through the date the $182,191.75 was tendered.Â  Appellant filed a motion requesting the lower court â€œdeclare the legal rights between the parties with respect to the issue of post-judgment interest.â€Â  An order filed on January 19, 2004 determined Appellant was entitled only to post-judgment interest in the amount of $182,191.75, which had already been tendered by Respondent.Â  Appellant now appeals.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n        The interpretation of a statute is a matter of law.Â  Eldridge v. City of Greenwood, 331 S.C. 398, 416, 503 S.E.2d 191, 200 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  In an action at law, our scope of review extends only to the correction of errors of law.Â  Okatie River, L.L.C. v. Southeastern Site Prep,\r\n        L.L.C., 353 S.C. 327, 334, 577 S.E.2d 468, 472 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  In an action at law, the trial judgeâ€™s findings of fact will not be disturbed on appeal unless the findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an erroneous application of the law.Â  Gordon v. Colonial Ins. Co. of California, 342 S.C. 152, 155, 536 S.E.2d 376, 378 (Ct. App. 2000).Â Â Â  \r\n            LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n            Appellant argues the trial court erred by determining the accrual of post-judgment interest ceased when the Respondent paid a portion of its â€œcombined judgment/post-judgment interest obligation.â€Â  We disagree.\r\n            Section 34-31-20(b) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004), which governs the award of post-judgment interest, provides that â€œ[a]ll money decrees and judgments of courts enrolled or entered shall draw interest according to law.â€Â  The parties agreed that this statute has been interpreted as providing for simple interest, not compound interest.Â  \r\n            Our Supreme Court has defined compound interest as â€œinterest on interest; that is, accrued interest is added periodically to the principle and interest is computed upon the new principle thus formed.â€Â  In the Matter of Howard, 315 S.C. 356, 362, 434 S.E.2d 254, 258 (1993).Â  By arguing that he is entitled to additional post-judgment interest, the Appellant is making a claim for compound rather than simple interest.Â  According to simple interest, post-judgment interest accrued only on the $250,000 judgment and once Respondent paid that judgment, which occurred on December 4, 2001, no additional interest accrued.[5]Â  Thus, because section 34-31-20(b) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004) does not specifically provide for compound interest, the trial judge was correct in concluding that additional interest does not accrue on interest.[6]  \r\n            AFFIRMED.\r\n            ANDERSON, BEATTY, AND SHORT, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215], SCACR.\r\n[2] At the time of the accident, the South Carolina Tort Claims Act, under which these claims were brought, included monetary caps of $250,000 per person and $500,000 per occurrence.\r\n[3] Tench v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Educ., 347 S.C. 117, 553 S.E.2d 451 (2001).\r\n[4] The order stated that â€œ[t]he Defendant must satisfy the Plaintiffâ€™s judgment with post-judgment interest at the statutory rate of 14% from September 20, 1996 through the date of satisfaction.â€Â  The order did not provide for the payment of additional post-judgment interest after December 4, 2001, nor did it provide for the payment of interest on interest.\r\n[5] Although Appellant describes Respondentâ€™s post-judgment interest as a component of a â€œjudgment/post-judgment interest obligation,â€ he acknowledges in his brief that that â€œpost-judgment interest is not part of the judgment itself.â€\r\n[6]  Judge Few correctly stated in his order that â€œ[i]f interest in interest is due in a situation such as this, it is the role of the General Assembly to provide for an award of compound interest by statute.â€Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-162","title":"State v.

Creighton Waters, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Warren Blair Giese, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Lucius Staten appeals his conviction for lynching in the first degree.Â  He argues the trial court erred in (1) admitting a prior statement by the decedent; (2) barring evidence regarding an alleged confession; and (3) refusing to charge the jury on the law of mere association and mere suspicion.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn January 15, 2001, Phillip Lee, Jr., a student of Benedict College and a reputed gang member of the Crips, was gunned down on Benedictâ€™s campus.Â  Brothers Lucius and Dushun Staten were indicted for the offenses of murder and lynching in the first degree for this crime.Â  They were tried together in 2002.Â  The jury found Dushun and Lucius guilty of lynching in the first degree, but only Dushun guilty of murder.[1]Â  The trial court sentenced Lucius to fifteen years, suspended upon the service of eight years for lynching.Â  The court sentenced Dushun to thirty years for murder and ten years for lynching, to run concurrently.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001); State v. Wood, Op. No. 3900 (S.C. Ct. App. filed December 6, 2004) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 47 at 74).Â  This court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 527 S.E.2d 105 (2000); State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 606 S.E.2d 503 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The appellate court does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence, but simply determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 575 S.E.2d 852 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  A trial courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of legal error that results in prejudice to the defendant.Â  State v. McLeod, 362 S.C. 73, 606 S.E.2d 215 (Ct. App. 2004); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law.Â  State v. Horton, 359 S.C. 555, 598 S.E.2d 279 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nThe appellate court should examine the record to determine whether there is any evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  See Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.Â  If there is any evidence in the record, the appellate court should affirm.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Statement Made by the Decedent\r\nLucius claims the trial court erred in admitting Andrew Brittâ€™s testimony that Lee told him that Dushun pulled a gun on him shortly prior to the incident.Â  We disagree.\r\nAndrew Britt, Leeâ€™s cousin and Benedict roommate, testified that on the evening before the shooting, Lee, normally a â€œvery calm,â€ â€œlaid back kind of person,â€ arrived in his dorm room â€œvery hysterical and like scared.â€Â  Britt asked: â€œPhil, whatâ€™s wrong with you?â€Â  Though Lee avoided answering Brittâ€™s questions for a while, Lee eventually confessed that â€œthey just pulled a . . . gun on me.â€Â  When Britt asked who â€œpulledâ€ the gun on him, Lee declared: â€œThe niggers we had a[n] argument with on Saturday.â€[2]\r\nDushun timely objected to this testimony based on the hearsay rule, but the trial court overruled the objection.Â  Later, on cross-examination by Luciusâ€™s attorney, Britt stated that Lee actually said, â€œThe small kid pulled out a gun and asked . . . whatâ€™s up now.â€Â  Britt believed Lee was specifically referring to the â€œlittle brother,â€ Dushun.\r\nA.Â  Issue Preservation\r\nInitially, we note that Lucius did not object to the hearsay statements during Brittâ€™s testimony.Â  Thus, the trial court did not have an opportunity to rule upon the objection.Â  It is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.Â  See State v. Perez, 334 S.C. 563, 514 S.E.2d 754 (1999); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Furthermore, although Dushun objected, an appellant may not preserve an issue for appeal by way of a co-defendantâ€™s objection.Â  See State v. Carriker, 269 S.C. 553, 555, 238 S.E.2d 678, 678 (1977) (â€œWhile appellantâ€™s co-defendant did object, the appellant may not utilize the objection of another defendant to gain review.â€); State v. Brannon, 347 S.C. 85, 552 S.E.2d 773 (Ct. App. 2001) (stating appellant may not bootstrap an issue for appeal by way of a co-defendantâ€™s objection).Â  Accordingly, this issue may not have been properly preserved.\r\nB.Â  Efficacy of Crawford v. Washington[3]\r\nThe Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment guarantees an accused the right â€œto be confronted with the witnesses against himâ€ in a criminal prosecution.Â  U.S. Const. amend. VI.Â  The provision is applicable to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment.Â  Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400 (1965).Â  The South Carolina constitution provides the same protection to a defendant.Â  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 14.\r\nThe right of confrontation is essential to a fair trial in that it promotes reliability in criminal trials and ensures that convictions will not result from testimony of individuals who cannot be challenged at trial.Â  California v. Green, 399 U.S. 149 (1970); State v. Gillian, 360 S.C. 433, 602 S.E.2d 62 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The Confrontation Clause guarantees the accused the right to confront those testifying against him in court and further defines the scope of the admissibility of statements against him made by witnesses out-of-court.Â  See Coy v. Iowa, 487 U.S. 1012 (1988).Â  A defendant exercises his right of confrontation through cross-examination, which has been described as the â€œgreatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.â€Â  Green, 399 U.S. at 158 (internal quotations omitted).\r\nFor nearly twenty-five years, the question of whether an unavailable witnessâ€™s prior statements could be used against a criminal defendant at trial was governed by Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56 (1980):\r\n\r\n[W]hen a hearsay declarant is not present for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation Clause normally requires a showing that he is unavailable.Â  Even then, his statement is admissible only if it bears adequate â€œindicia of reliability.â€Â  Reliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.Â  In other cases, the evidence must be excluded, at least absent a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\r\n\r\nId. at 66.Â  Thus, under Roberts, an unavailable witnessâ€™s out-of-court statement was admissible if it: (1) fell within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule; or (2) contained such particularized guarantees of trustworthiness that adversarial testing of the statement through cross-examination would add little to the assessment of the reliability of the evidence.\r\nIn March 2004, the Supreme Court concluded that the long-standing Roberts rule was untenable.Â  The Court, in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (2004), announced a new test to determine the admissibility under the Confrontation Clause of hearsay offered against the accused.Â  Crawford was convicted of assault and attempted murder.Â  Over his confrontation objection, the prosecution was allowed to offer a recorded statement his wife made to the police in which she appeared to contradict Crawfordâ€™s claim that he attacked the victim in self-defense. Because the wife herself was under suspicion of facilitating the assault, her statement was admitted for its truth under Washingtonâ€™s hearsay exception for declarations against penal interest.Â  This exception required the prosecution to show that the declarant was unavailable to testify, and due to that unavailability, Crawford did not have an opportunity to cross-examine his wife about her out-of-court statement. The Court reversed Crawfordâ€™s conviction.Â  Crawford changes the Courtâ€™s previous confrontation analysis.\r\n Crawford traced the development of Confrontation Clause jurisprudence, beginning with English common law and extending to recent decisions made by state and federal courts throughout the country.Â  As a threshold matter, the Supreme Courtâ€™s analysis identified the â€œprincipal evilâ€ which the Confrontation Clause was intended to deter, â€œthe civil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its use of ex parte examinations as evidence against the accused.â€Â  Id. at Â Â Â , 124 S.Ct. at 1363.Â  The Court rejected the view that the regulation of out-of-court statements could be accomplished solely by the rules of evidence.Â  Id. at Â Â Â , 124 S.Ct. at 1364.\r\nThe Crawford Court clarified the Confrontation Clause â€œapplies to â€˜witnessesâ€™ against the accusedâ€”in other words, those who â€˜bear testimony.â€™â€Â  Id. at Â Â Â , 124 S.Ct. at 1364.Â  â€œTestimonyâ€ is typically a solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.â€Â  Id. (internal quotations omitted).Â  â€œAn accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.Â  Id.\r\nWith respect to testimonial hearsay, at least, the Supreme Court overruled its previous decision in Roberts to maintain consistency with the Framersâ€™ intent.Â  Id. at Â Â Â , 124 S.Ct. at 1374; see also Thomas J. Reed, Crawford v. Washington and the Irretrievable Breakdown of a Union: Separating the Confrontation Clause from the Hearsay Rule, 56 S.C. L. Rev. 185, 216 (2004) (â€œIn Crawford v. Washington, the United States Supreme Court finally overruled Ohio v. Roberts, divorcing the Confrontation Clause and the hearsay rule because of an irreconcilable breakdown of the relationship.â€) (footnotes omitted).Â  The unpardonable vice of the Roberts test is â€œits demonstrated capacity to admit core testimonial statements that the Confrontation Clause plainly meant to exclude.â€Â  Id. at Â Â Â , 124 S.Ct. at 1371.Â  The Court concluded:\r\n\r\nWhere nontestimonial hearsay is at issue, it is wholly consistent with the Framersâ€™ design to afford the States flexibility in their development of hearsay law--as does Roberts, and as would an approach that exempted such statements from Confrontation Clause scrutiny altogether.Â  Where testimonial evidence is at issue, however, the Sixth Amendment demands what the common law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\r\n\r\nId. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1374.\r\nIn rejecting the Roberts â€œindicia of reliabilityâ€ test, the Court held that the Sixth Amendment bars an out-of-court statement by a witness that is testimonial in nature unless the witness is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him.Â  Id. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1374.Â  â€œWhere testimonial statements are at issue, the only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is the one the Constitution actually prescribes: confrontation.â€ Â Id. at Â Â Â , 124 S.Ct. at 1374.Â  â€œFor testimonial statements, the Court figuratively erected a â€˜stop signâ€™ as to admissibility in the absence of confrontation.â€Â  Robert P. Mosteller, Crawford v. Washington: Encouraging and Ensuring the Confrontation of Witnesses, 39 U. Rich. L. Rev. 511, 525 (2005).Â  â€œFor statements in this category, [Crawford] firmly rejected the â€˜reliabilityâ€™ or â€˜trustworthinessâ€™ mode of analysis adopted by Ohio v. Roberts.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe Court decided to â€œleave for another day any effort to spell out a comprehensive definition of â€˜testimonial.â€™â€Â  Crawford, 541 U.S. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1374.Â  However, the Court provided three â€œformulations of [the] core class of testimonial statementsâ€:\r\n\r\nVarious formulations of this core class of â€œtestimonialâ€ statements exist: â€œex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent--that is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutoriallyâ€; â€œextrajudicial statements . . . contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessionsâ€; â€œstatements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.â€ . . . .\r\nStatements taken by police officers in the course of interrogations are also testimonial under even a narrow standard.\r\n\r\nId. at Â Â Â , 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (citations omitted).Â  Although the Court declined to settle on a single formulation, it noted: â€œWhatever else the term covers, it applies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations.Â  These are the modern practices with closest kinship to the abuses at which the Confrontation Clause was directed.â€Â  Id. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1374.Â  In contrast to these examples, casual statements to an acquaintance are not testimonial.Â  Id. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1364.Â  Further, business records or statements in furtherance of a conspiracy are nontestimonial.Â  Id. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1367.\r\nC.Â  Testimonial vs. Nontestimonial\r\nIn the wake of the Crawford decision, the crucial inquiry is whether a particular statement is testimonial or nontestimonial.Â  Many courts are grappling with the distinction Crawford created between testimonial and nontestimonial hearsay.Â  See United States v. Saget, 377 F.3d 223 (2d Cir. 2004); United States v. Corley, 348 F. Supp. 2d 970 (N.D.Ind. 2004); Thomas J. Reed, Crawford v. Washington and the Irretrievable Breakdown of a Union: Separating the Confrontation Clause from the Hearsay Rule, 56 S.C. L. Rev. 185 (2004).Â  â€œIn determining whether a statement is testimonial or non-testimonial, courts are consistently applying the Crawford two-pronged analysis to otherwise admissible hearsay statements: (1) Was the statement made to a governmental agent (or in response to questioning from a governmental agent)? (2) Would the declarant expect his/her statement to later be used at trial?â€Â  Allie Phillips, A Flurry of Court Interpretations: Weathering the Storm after Crawford v. Washington, 38-Dec Prosecutor 37 (Nov/Dec 2004).\r\n1.Â  Testimonial Statements\r\nCourts are attempting to define the types of hearsay that constitute testimonial statements.Â  The Colorado Court of Appeals explained that testimonial statements under Crawford will generally be (1) solemn or formal statements (not casual or off-hand remarks); (2) made for the purpose of proving or establishing facts in judicial proceedings (not for business or personal purposes); (3) to a government actor or agent (not to someone unassociated with government activity).Â  People v. Compan, 100 P.3d 533 (Colo. Ct. App. 2004), cert. granted (Oct. 25, 2004).Â  â€œ[S]tatements cited by the [Crawford] Court as testimonial share certain characteristics; all involve a declarantâ€™s knowing responses to structured questioning in an investigative environment or a courtroom setting where the declarant would reasonably expect that his or her responses might be used in future judicial proceedings.â€Â  United States v. Saget, 377 F.3d 223, 228 (2d Cir. 2004); see also United States v. Saner, 313 F. Supp. 2d 896 (S.D.Ind. 2004) (holding statements made in response to questioning outside of the courtroom by Department of Justice prosecutor were testimonial).Â  The Supreme Court of Georgia, in Moody v. State, 594 S.E.2d 350 (Ga. 2004), held that â€œpolice interrogations,â€ as delineated in Crawford as testimonial, include the field investigation of witnesses shortly after the commission of a crime.Â  Id. at 354 n.6; cf. Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Court of Nevada, 124 S.Ct. 2451, 2463 (2004) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (â€œSurely police questioning during a Terry stop qualifies as an interrogation, and it follows that responses to such questions are testimonial in nature.â€).\r\nUnited States v. Cromer, 389 F.3d 662, 675 (6th Cir. 2004), found that â€œ[a] statement made knowingly to the authorities that describes criminal activity is almost always testimonialâ€ and thus concluded that the confidential informantâ€™s statement to the police wherein the CI implicated the defendant in criminal activity constituted testimonial hearsay.Â  The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals further noted that statements made to the authorities, who will use them in investigating and prosecuting a crime, made with the full understanding that the statements will be so used, are testimonial.\r\nâ€œIf an out-of-court statement is taken by a government agent (police officer, prosecutor, child protective services worker employed by the state), the statement will be considered testimonial so long as the witness reasonably could expect that statement to be used at a later trial.â€Â  Phillips, 38-Dec Prosecutor at 37.\r\nIn United States v. Nielsen, 371 F.3d 574 (9th Cir. 2004), the defendantâ€™s girlfriend made statements to the police that incriminated the defendant during the service of a search warrant at their mutual residence.Â  The police asked the girlfriend who had access to the floor safe where the methamphetamine was found.Â  She replied that the defendant did.Â  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found the statements were testimonial.\r\nUnited States v. McClain, 377 F.3d 219 (2d Cir. 2004), discussed the testimonial aspect of a plea allocution: â€œIn light of [the] examples cited by the [Crawford] Court as testimonial, it is clear that a plea allocution constitutes testimony, as it is formally given in court, under oath, and in response to questions by the court or the prosecutor.â€Â  Id. at 221; see also People v. Woods, 779 N.Y.S.2d 494 (N.Y. App. Div. 2004) (finding that admission of robbery accompliceâ€™s plea allocution into evidence, following accompliceâ€™s refusal to testify on constitutional grounds, violated defendantâ€™s Sixth Amendment confrontation rights because plea allocutions are among the core testimonial statements that the Confrontation Clause plainly meant to exclude).\r\nCity of Las Vegas v. Walsh, 91 P.3d 591 (Nev. 2004), recognized that an affidavit prepared by a registered nurse, in connection with the drawing of blood for use in evidence regarding intoxication, was testimonial, despite the nurseâ€™s apparent private status.Â  The Supreme Court of Nevada emphasized that such an affidavit is â€œprepared solely for the prosecutionâ€™s use at trial.â€Â  Id. at 595.\r\n2.Â  Nontestimonial Statements\r\nCourts are beginning to formulate case law defining what nontestimonial statements entail.Â  â€œ[S]tatements made to family, friends, and acquaintances without an intention for use at trial have consistently been held not to be testimonial, even if highly incriminating to another.â€Â  Robert P. Mosteller, Crawford v. Washington: Encouraging and Ensuring the Confrontation of Witnesses, 39 U. Rich. L. Rev. 511, 540 (2005).Â  Private conversations between confidants have been found to be nontestimonial.\r\nIn United States v. Manfre, 368 F.3d 832, 838 n.1 (8th Cir. 2004), the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Crawford was inapplicable because the statements â€œwere made to loved ones or acquaintances and are not the kind of memorialized, judicial-process-created evidence of which Crawford speaks.â€\r\nState v. Blackstock, 598 S.E.2d 412 (N.C. Ct. App. 2004), involved extended statements made by a victim fatally shot during a robbery to his wife and daughter while in the hospital.Â  The Court of Appeals of North Carolina concluded the statements were nontestimonial.Â  The statements were made during personal conversations that took place at the hospital over a series of several days after the shooting and at a time when the victimâ€™s physical condition was improving and therefore would not have been anticipated by him to be used prosecutorially.\r\nIn State v. Rivera, 844 A.2d 191 (Conn. 2004), an unavailable declarantâ€™s statement to his nephew, admitting his participation with defendant in a burglary that had given rise to a homicide, was found to be nontestimonial because it failed under the most expansive test articulated by Crawford: an objective witness would not reasonably believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.Â  The declarant made the statement in confidence and on his own initiative to a close family member, almost eighteen months before the defendant was arrested and more than four years before his own arrest.Â  The Supreme Court of Connecticut held: â€œIn light of these circumstances, [the declarantâ€™s] communication to . . . his nephew clearly does not fall within the core category of ex parte testimonial statements that the court was concerned with in Crawford.â€Â  Id. at 202.\r\nIn People v. Shepherd, 689 N.W.2d 721 (Mich. Ct. App. 2004), the codefendant had made spontaneous, unprompted statements to his relatives about his role in an offense.Â  The statements were made in a custodial setting and were overheard by jail guards.Â  The Court of Appeals of Michigan explained the statements were not testimonial in nature, stating the declarant could not have reasonably believed that the statements would later be used at a trial.\r\nThe Supreme Court of Georgia, in Demons v. State, 595 S.E.2d 76 (Ga. 2004), articulated that a murder victimâ€™s statements to his friend, made during an incident involving the defendant several weeks prior to the murder, to the effect that the defendant was going to kill him, were not testimonial in nature.Â  Thereafter, the court addressed a similar issue in Watson v. State, 604 S.E.2d 804 (Ga. 2004), and found statements that an alleged murder victim made to three close friends over approximately ten years were not testimonial.Â  The statements concerned threats by the defendant and episodes of physical and mental abuse.\r\nIn People v. Cervantes, 12 Cal. Rptr. 3d 774 (Cal. Ct. App. 2004), evidence of one defendantâ€™s incriminating hearsay statement, which also implicated codefendants in a murder prosecution, was nontestimonial.Â  The declarant made the statement to a friend of long standing in the context of a request for medical assistance from the friend, and, given that the friend was afraid to testify since she knew that all the defendants were gang members, the statement was made without any reasonable expectation that it would be used at a later trial.\r\nIn People v. Griffin, 93 P.3d 344, 369 (Cal. 2004), the Supreme Court of California held a child murder victimâ€™s statement to a school friend made on the day that the crime occurred that the â€œdefendant had been fondling her for some time and that [the victim] intended to confront him if he continuedâ€ was not testimonial.\r\nThe Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas, in Woods v. State, 152 S.W.3d 105 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004), analyzed the co-defendantâ€™s out-of-court statements to two acquaintances, indicating his involvement in murders with the defendant.Â  The court recognized the statements were casual remarks that he spontaneously made to acquaintances.Â  They were â€œstreet cornerâ€ statements that the co-defendant made to friends without any motive to shift blame to another or minimize his own involvement in the murders.Â  The court found the statements were nontestimonial in nature.\r\nIn People v. Compan, 100 P.3d 533 (Colo. Ct. App. 2004), cert. granted (Oct. 25, 2004), the Colorado Court of Appeals concluded that statements of a non-testifying domestic violence victim to her friend immediately after the attack did not qualify as testimonial.Â  Subsequently, the court decided People v. Garrison, No. 01CA0527, 2004 WL 2278287 (Colo. Ct. App. 2004).Â  In Garrison, the court determined the murder victimâ€™s hearsay statements to his training manager that â€œan old friendâ€ was threatening to kill him were not testimonial. Thus, admission of the statements did not violate the defendantâ€™s right of confrontation.Â  The statements were not made to the police, and there was no indication that the training manager was acting as a police agent.\r\nHorton v. Allen, 370 F.3d 75 (1st Cir. 2004), amplified that a statement, admitted under the state of mind hearsay exception, that on the day of the murders defendantâ€™s accomplice had told a witness that he needed money and that the victim had refused to give him drugs on credit, was nontestimonial.Â  The First Circuit Court of Appeals emphasized the accompliceâ€™s statements were made during a private conversation with the witness.Â  â€œIn short, [the accomplice] did not make the statements under circumstances in which an objective person would â€˜reasonably believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.â€™â€Â  Id. at 84.\r\nParle v. Runnels, 387 F.3d 1030 (9th Cir. 2004), clarified that an unavailable declarantâ€™s diary entries were nontestimonial.Â  The diary â€œwas not created â€˜under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that [it] would be available for use at a later trial.â€™â€Â  Id. at 1037.\r\nUnited States v. Hendricks, 395 F.3d 173 (3d Cir. 2005), expounded that surreptitiously monitored private conversations and statements contained in Title III wiretap recordings are not â€œtestimonial statementsâ€ for purposes of Crawford.Â  The Third Circuit Court of Appeals noted: (1) the recorded conversations neither fell within nor were analogous to any of the specific examples of testimonial statements mentioned by the Crawford Court; (2) each of the examples referred to by the Crawford Court or the definitions it considered entails a formality to the statement absent from the recorded statements in Hendricks; (3) the Title III recordings cannot be deemed testimonial as the speakers certainly did not make the statements thinking that they would be available for use at a later trial; and (4) the very purpose of Title III intercepts is to capture conversations that the participants believe are not being heard by the authorities and will not be available for use in a prosecution.\r\nThe status of 911 calls has been addressed by the courts.Â  In People v. Moscat, 777 N.Y.S.2d 875 (N.Y. Crim. Ct. 2004), the court determined that a 911 call is not testimonial because it is typically initiated by the witness looking for assistance rather than by the police summoning a witness to provide evidence.Â  People v. Conyers, 777 N.Y.S.2d 274, 277 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2004), held that a callerâ€™s statements were nontestimonial because her â€œintention in placing the 911 calls was to stop the assault in progress and not to consider the legal ramifications of herself as a witness in a future proceeding.â€Â  Cf. People v. Cortes, 781 N.Y.S.2d 401, 415 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2004) (reasoning that statements about an ongoing shooting made by a witness during a 911 call amounted to testimonial evidence because the information was elicited by 911 operatorâ€™s use of an accepted pattern of questioning for the purpose of investigation, prosecution, and potential use at judicial proceedings; â€œan objective reasonable person knows that when he or she reports a crime the statement will be used in an investigation and at proceedings relating to a prosecution.â€).\r\nThe Court of Appeals of Washington, in State v. Powers, 99 P.3d 1262 (Wash. Ct. App. 2004), rejected a bright line rule that all 911 recordings are nontestimonial, opting instead to employ a case-by-case analysis into whether statements contained on a 911 recording originated from interrogation.\r\nThe Court of Appeals of Minnesota concluded statements made by the victims during their 911 call were not testimonial statements and, thus, were admissible in the assault trial despite the victimsâ€™ unavailability at trial and the defendantâ€™s lack of prior opportunity to cross-examine the victims.Â  State v. Wright, 686 N.W.2d 295 (Minn. Ct. App. 2004), review granted (Nov. 23, 2004).Â  The statements in Wright were made moments after the assault while the victims were struggling for self-control and survival, no evidence suggested the call was handled by the 911 operator under formalized protocol, and the victims were providing information for immediate intervention and not for eventual prosecution.Â  Wright inculcated:\r\n\r\n[T]hese statements do not fit within the definitions or the examples of testimonial statements.Â  A 911 call is usually made because the caller wants protection from an immediate danger, not because the 911 caller expects the report to be used later at trial with the caller bearing witnessâ€”rather, there is a cloak of anonymity surrounding 911 calls that encourages citizens to make emergency calls and not fear repercussion.\r\n\r\nId. at 302.\r\nA number of courts have found that statements made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment are nontestimonial.Â  In State v. Vaught, 682 N.W.2d 284 (Neb. 2004), a four-year-old victim of sexual abuse informed a physician during a medical examination about the identity of the defendant.Â  The Supreme Court of Nebraska decided the statements by the child to the physician were nontestimonial.Â  The court explicated:\r\n\r\n[T]he victimâ€™s identification of Vaught as the perpetrator was a statement made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment.Â  In the present case, the victim was taken to the hospital by her family to be examined and the only evidence regarding the purpose of the medical examination, including the information regarding the cause of the symptoms, was to obtain medical treatment.Â  There was no indication of a purpose to develop testimony for trial, nor was there an indication of government involvement in the initiation or course of the examination.\r\n\r\nId. at 291.Â  In State v. Scacchetti, 690 N.W.2d 393 (Minn. Ct. App. 2005), the Court of Appeals of Minnesota ruled a three-year-old victimâ€™s out-of-court statements to her examining physician that defendantâ€™s penis touched her vaginal and anal openings, together with videotaped statements during her conversation with the physician that defendant put his hands â€œright in there,â€ referring to her anal opening, were not testimonial.Â  Admission of the statements in a criminal sexual conduct trial did not violate the defendantâ€™s right of confrontation where they were made in response to questions by the physician for purposes of medical diagnosis and the physician was not working on behalf of law enforcement for the purpose of developing a case against the defendant.\r\nIn re T.T., 815 N.E.2d 789 (Ill. App. Ct. 2004), reasoned that a victimâ€™s statements to medical personnel regarding descriptions of the cause of symptoms, pain or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof are not testimonial in nature where such statements do not accuse or identify the perpetrator of the assault.\r\nThe Court of Appeals of Michigan concluded admission of the child victimâ€™s statement through the testimony of the executive director of the local Childrenâ€™s Assessment Center, a private organization, did not violate the defendantâ€™s right to confront his accuser in a trial for criminal sexual conduct.Â  People v. Geno, 683 N.W.2d 687 (Mich. Ct. App. 2004).Â  The statement did not constitute testimonial evidence, as it was not made to a government employee, and the childâ€™s answer to the question whether she had an â€œowieâ€ was not a statement in the nature of ex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent.Â  Id.\r\nCourts have discussed the nontestimonial nature of various reports.Â  The Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama held an autopsy report showing the cause of death of a homicide victim was not testimonial.Â  Perkins v. State, CR-02-1779, 2004 WL 923506 (Ala. Crim. App. 2004).Â  The Supreme Court of New Mexico, in State v. Dedman, 102 P.3d 628 (N.M. 2004), declared a blood alcohol report showing the defendantâ€™s blood alcohol level at the time of the vehicle accident was nontestimonial for purposes of determining whether admission of the report, without testimony of the nurse who drew the blood sample, violated the defendantâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation in a prosecution for aggravated driving while under the influence of intoxicating drugs.Â  The report was generated by State laboratory personnel, not law enforcement, and the report was not investigative or prosecutorial.\r\nCo-conspirator statements have been found to be nontestimonial.Â  See, e.g., United States v. Reyes, 362 F.3d 536 (8th Cir. 2004) (stating that Crawford does not apply to co-conspirator statements because they are nontestimonial).Â  In United States v. Saget, 377 F.3d 223 (2d Cir. 2004), the Second Circuit Court of Appeals determined a co-conspiratorâ€™s statements against the defendant to a confidential informant, whose true status was unknown to the co-conspirator, were not testimonial.Â  Noting Crawfordâ€™s specific caveat that it only pertains to testimonial statements, the court pointed out that the co-conspirator had no knowledge of the confidential informantâ€™s connection to investigators and believed that he was having a casual conversation with a friend and potential co-conspirator.Â  Id.Â  In fact, all circuits that have considered this issue with respect to co-conspirators have reached a similar conclusion.Â  See, e.g., Horton v. Allen, 370 F.3d 75 (1st Cir. 2004); United States v. Lee, 374 F.3d 637 (8th Cir. 2004); People v. Cook, 815 N.E.2d 879 (Ill. App. Ct. 2004); Thomas J. Reed, Crawford v. Washington and the Irretrievable Breakdown of a Union: Separating the Confrontation Clause from the Hearsay Rule, 56 S.C. L. Rev. 185 (2004); see also Williams v. SCI-Huntingdon, No. Civ.A. 02-CV-7693, 2004 WL 2203734, at *11 n.7 (E.D.Pa. Sept. 30, 2004) (â€œâ€˜an off-hand, overheard remarkâ€™ to an acquaintance, such as . . . one made by [a] co-conspirator . . ., is outside the scope of Crawford and thus does not violate the Confrontation Clause.â€).\r\nSome courts have examined what encompasses â€œinterrogationâ€ within the meaning of Crawford.Â  In Fowler v. State, 809 N.E.2d 960 (Ind. Ct. App. 2004), transfer granted (Dec. 9, 2004), the Court of Appeals of Indiana ruled that when police arrive at the scene of an incident in response to a request for assistance and begin informally questioning those nearby immediately thereafter in order to determine what has happened, statements given in response thereto are not testimonial.Â  The court observed that what constitutes a testimonial statement is the official and formal quality of such a statement.Â  The court noted that Crawford chose not to say that any police questioning of a witness would make a statement in response thereto testimonial.Â  Rather, Crawford expressly limited its holding to police â€œinterrogation.â€Â  The court stated: â€œWhatever else police â€˜interrogationâ€™ might be, we do not believe that word applies to preliminary investigatory questions asked at the scene of a crime shortly after it has occurred.â€Â  Id. at 964.\r\nIn People v. Corella, 18 Cal. Rptr. 3d 770, 776 (Cal. Ct. App. 2004), the California Court of Appeal illuminated:\r\n\r\nPreliminary questions asked at the scene of a crime shortly after it has occurred do not rise to the level of an â€œinterrogation.â€Â  Such an unstructured interaction between officer and witness bears no resemblance to a formal or informal police inquiry that is required for a police interrogation [that results in inadmissible testimonial hearsay].\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Judicial Court of Maine, in State v. Barnes, 854 A.2d 208 (Me. 2004), found to be nontestimonial statements that were made by the murder defendantâ€™s mother (the victim) to police officers at the station house where she went after an earlier assault by her son.Â  The interaction did not involve structured police interrogation triggering the cross-examination requirement of the Confrontation Clause in admitting the officerâ€™s testimony regarding the motherâ€™s statements.Â  The mother went to the police station on her own, her statements to the officers were made when she was still under the stress of the alleged assault by the defendant, and officers were not questioning her regarding known criminal activity.\r\nIn State v. Forrest, 596 S.E.2d 22 (N.C. Ct. App. 2004), the Court of Appeals of North Carolina concluded a crime victimâ€™s statements to an officer made shortly after she was rescued from a kidnapping and assault by the police were not testimonial.Â  The statements were made immediately after the rescue and with no time for reflection or thought on the victimâ€™s part and were initiated spontaneously by the victim.Â  The victim was not (1) providing a formal statement, deposition, or affidavit; (2) aware she was bearing witness; or (3) aware her utterances might impact further legal proceedings.Â  Id. at 27; see also People v. Newland, 775 N.Y.S.2d 308, 309 (N.Y. App. Div. 2004) (â€œ[A] brief, informal remark to an officer conducting a field investigation, not made in response to â€˜structured police questioningâ€™ should not be considered testimonial.â€); People v. Mackey, 785 N.Y.S.2d 870 (N.Y. Crim. Ct. 2004) (stating responses to police officers during a preliminary field investigation are not barred as testimonial statements under Crawford if the statements and the circumstances in which they were made lack the requisite formality to constitute a police interrogation).\r\nVarious jurisdictions have addressed the status of excited utterances as nontestimonial.Â  In People v. King, No. 02CA0201, 2005 WL 170727, at *5 (Colo. Ct. App., Jan 27, 2005), the Colorado Court of Appeals elucidated:\r\n\r\n[C]lassification of a statement as an excited utterance, while not dispositive, supports a conclusion that a statement is nontestimonial.Â  An excited utterance by definition is one made before the declarant has had an opportunity to reflect on the event.Â  Therefore, it is consistent with the definition of an excited utterance to conclude that it is not a statement which a declarant would reasonably believe at the time it was made might later be used at trial.\r\n\r\nIn Hammon v. State, 809 N.E.2d 945 (Ind. Ct. App. 2004), transfer granted (Dec. 9, 2004), the victim made a number of excited utterances to police officers at the scene of the crime, in response to preliminary police questions.Â  In concluding these excited utterances did not constitute testimonial statements, the Court of Appeals of Indiana declared:\r\n\r\n[T]he very concept of an â€œexcited utteranceâ€ is such that it is difficult to perceive how such a statement could ever be â€œtestimonial.â€Â  The underlying rationale of the excited utterance exception is that such a declaration from one who has recently suffered an overpowering experience is likely to be truthful. . . . An unrehearsed statement made without time for reflection or deliberation, as required to be an excited utterance, is not â€œtestimonialâ€ in that such a statement, by definition, has not been made in contemplation of its use in a future trial.\r\n\r\nId. at 952-53 (citations omitted).\r\nA number of courts dealing with excited utterances have taken the approach of analyzing the intent of the declarant and determining whether the recipient of the excited utterance questions the declarant.Â  See Allie Phillips, A Flurry of Court Interpretations: Weathering the Storm after Crawford v. Washington, 38-Dec Prosecutor 37 (Nov/Dec 2004).Â  For example, if a declarant provides an excited utterance that is simply a cry for help or for medical treatment, and if the witness would not reasonably expect the statement to be used in a prosecutorial manner at the time the utterance is made, then those utterances are being declared nontestimonial and are subject to a traditional hearsay analysis.Â  See, e.g., People v. Moscat, 777 N.Y.S.2d 875 (N.Y. Crim. Ct. 2004); State v. Forrest, 596 S.E.2d 22 (N.C. Ct. App. 2004); State v. Orndorff, 95 P.3d 406 (Wash. Ct. App. 2004).Â  However, if a declarant provides an excited utterance that could reasonably be expected to be used at a later trial (such as reporting a crime), or if a statement is made in response to questioning by a 911 operator, those utterances are being declared testimonial and will require the witness to testify.Â  Phillips, 38-Dec Prosecutor at 41.\r\nD.Â  Status of Leeâ€™s Statements under Crawford\r\nThe analysis of whether the admission of Leeâ€™s statements violated the Confrontation Clause begins with the question of whether the statements are testimonial, triggering Crawfordâ€™s per se rule against their admission.Â  In this case, Leeâ€™s statements were not: (1) ex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent; (2) extrajudicial statements contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony transcripts, or confessions; or (3) taken by police officers in the course of an interrogation.Â  Rather, Leeâ€™s statements were made during a private conversation with his cousin and roommate, Britt.Â  See Crawford, 541 U.S. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (â€œAn accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.â€).Â  Significantly, the decedent did not make the statements â€œâ€˜under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.â€™â€Â  Id.Â  Concomitantly, Leeâ€™s statements do not qualify as testimonial.\r\nLeeâ€™s statements are nontestimonial.Â  Consequently, their admission is outside of Crawfordâ€™s scope.Â  See Crawford, 541 U.S. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1364.\r\nE.Â  Applicability of Ohio v. Roberts\r\nâ€œJustice Scaliaâ€™s opinion [in Crawford] hints, but does not decide, that the Confrontation Clause no longer applies to non-testimonial hearsay, and that its admission is governed by a jurisdictionâ€™s hearsay rulesâ€ and Robertsâ€™ â€œindicia of reliabilityâ€ approach.Â  David F. Binder, Hearsay Handbook Â§ 7:2 (4th ed. 2004).Â  Most jurisdictions are leaning toward the idea that â€œCrawford [left] the Roberts approach untouched with respect to nontestimonial statements.â€Â  United States v. Saget, 377 F.3d 223, 227 (2d Cir. 2004); see also Horton v. Allen, 370 F.3d 75, 84 (1st Cir. 2004) (â€œThus, unless Christianâ€™s statements qualify as â€˜testimonial,â€™ Crawford is inapplicable and Roberts continues to apply.â€); State v. Manuel, 685 N.W.2d 525, 533 (Wis. Ct. App. 2004), review granted, 689 N.W.2d 55 (Wis. 2004) (â€œ[W]e proceed, in an abundance of caution, to analyze Manuelâ€™s confrontation clause claim under the Roberts analysisâ€).\r\nBecause nontestimonial hearsay is at issue here, we apply the reliability test of Roberts to determine whether the admission of Leeâ€™s hearsay statements violated Luciusâ€™s Confrontation Clause rights.\r\nUnder Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56 (1980), for the statement to be admissible, the declarant must be unavailable, and the statement must fall within a firmly rooted hearsay exception or bear particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.Â  Obviously, Leeâ€™s death rendered him unavailable to testify.Â  Therefore, we examine whether Leeâ€™s statements fall within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\r\nâ€œâ€˜Hearsayâ€™ is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.â€Â  Rule 801(c), SCRE; see also State v. Thompson, 352 S.C. 552, 558, 575 S.E.2d 77, 81 (Ct. App. 2003) (â€œEvidence is not hearsay unless it is an out of court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.â€).Â  The rule against hearsay prohibits the admission of evidence of an out-of-court statement to prove the truth of the matter asserted unless an exception to the rule applies.Â  See Huggler v. State, 360 S.C. 627, 602 S.E.2d 753 (2004); State v. Weaver, 361 S.C. 73, 602 S.E.2d 786 (Ct. App. 2004); see also Rule 802, SCRE (â€œHearsay is not admissible except as provided by these rules or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court of this State or by statute.â€); Rule 803, SCRE (setting out exceptions to the hearsay rule).\r\nOne exception to the hearsay rule is an excited utterance.Â  Rule 803(2), SCRE.Â  An excited utterance is a â€œstatement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.â€Â  Id.Â  A statement that is admissible because it falls within an exception in Rule 803, such as the excited utterance exception, may be used substantively, that is, to prove the truth of the matter asserted.Â  State v. Sims, 348 S.C. 16, 558 S.E.2d 518&nbsp;(2002); State v. Dennis, 337 S.C. 275, 523 S.E.2d 173 (1999).\r\nâ€œThe rationale behind the excited utterance exception is that the startling event suspends the declarantâ€™s process of reflective thought, reducing the likelihood of fabrication.â€Â  Sims, 348 S.C. at 20, 558 S.E.2d at 521; see also State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 544 S.E.2d 30 (2001) (stating the basis for the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule is that the perceived event produces nervous excitement, making fabrication of the statements about the event unlikely).Â  An excited utterance expresses the real belief of the speaker because the utterance is made under the immediate and uncontrolled domination of the senses, rather than under reason and reflection.Â  McHoney, 344 S.C. at 94, 544 S.E.2d at 34.Â  In deciding whether a statement falls within the excited utterance exception, a court must consider the totality of the circumstances.Â  Id.Â  Such a determination is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Sims, 348 S.C. at 21, 558 S.E.2d at 521; State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 515 S.E.2d 525 (1999).\r\nâ€œThree elements must be met to find the statement [is] an excited utterance.â€Â  Sims, 348 S.C. at 21, 558 S.E.2d at 521.Â  First, the statement must relate to a startling event or condition.Â  Id.Â  Second, the statement must have been made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement.Â  Id.Â  Third, the stress of excitement must be caused by the startling event or condition.Â  Id. (citing Rule 803(2), SCRE).Â  Other factors useful in determining whether a statement qualifies as an excited utterance include the declarantâ€™s demeanor, the declarantâ€™s age, and the severity of the startling event.Â  Id. at 22, 558 S.E.2d at 521.\r\nThe statements here clearly meet the first element because they relate to the startling event of Lee having a gun â€œpulledâ€ on him.Â  As for whether Lee was â€œunder the stress of excitementâ€ when he made the statements, we note that the amount of time that passed between the startling event and the time the statement was made is one of several factors to consider when deciding whether a statement is an excited utterance.Â  Id. at 21, 558 S.E.2d at 521.Â  While the passage of time between the startling event and the statement is one factor to consider, it is not the dispositive factor.Â  Id.Â  Even statements after extended periods of time can be considered an excited utterance as long as they were made under continuing stress.Â  Id. at 22, 558 S.E.2d at 521.Â  Lee, normally a â€œcalm, humble, laid back kind of person,â€ was described by Britt as being â€œstorm, angry, storm, angry, just temper-high kind of person when he came in the roomâ€ on the Sunday evening before the shooting.Â  Britt testified that Lee â€œjust kept walking back, walking back and forth in the room.Â  Just like . . . banging on stuff.â€Â  When asked what had happened, Lee replied: â€œThey just pulled a . . . gun on me.â€ (emphasis added).Â  Leeâ€™s demeanor and the severity of the startling event are factors that weigh in favor of finding his statements to be excited utterances.Â  Finally, the third element is satisfied.Â  The â€œstress of excitementâ€ was caused by the â€œstartling eventâ€ of Lee having a gun â€œpulledâ€ on him.\r\nMoreover, the fact that the statements were made in regard to questioning by Britt does not preclude their admissibility.Â  See United States v. Iron Shell, 633 F.2d 77 (8th Cir. 1980) (noting the single question, â€œwhat happened,â€ has been held not to destroy the excitement necessary to qualify under excited utterance exception to hearsay rule); United States v. Glenn, 473 F.2d 191 (D.C. Cir. 1972) (stating fact that excited utterance is made in response to inquiry is not decisive on issue of admissibility).\r\nGiven the totality of the circumstances, we find Lee was under the continuing stress of excitement when he told Britt â€œthey just pulled a . . . gun on me.â€Â  When Britt asked who â€œpulledâ€ the gun on him, Lee declared: â€œThe niggers we had a[n] argument with on Saturday.â€Â  On cross-examination by Luciusâ€™s attorney, Britt stated that Lee actually said, â€œThe small kid pulled out a gun and asked . . . whatâ€™s up now.â€Â  Britt believed Lee was specifically referring to the â€œlittle brother,â€ Dushun.Â  The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Leeâ€™s statements to Britt because the statements fall under the excited utterance hearsay exception.\r\nWe are not required to find any other guarantees of trustworthiness because the court will only look to this prong if a statement does not fall within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.Â  See State v. Dennis, 337 S.C. 275, 523 S.E.2d 173 (1999).Â  Leeâ€™s statements constitute excited utterances.Â  The United States Supreme Court has held that an excited utterance is a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule.Â  See White v. Illinois, 502 U.S. 346 (1992); see also State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 45, 515 S.E.2d 525, 531 (1999) (â€œexcited utterance exception is firmly rooted in South Carolina law and satisfies the requirements of the Confrontation Clauseâ€).\r\nThe admission of Leeâ€™s statements satisfies Roberts.Â  The trial court correctly admitted the hearsay statements.Â  Luciusâ€™s Confrontation Clause rights were not violated.[4]\r\nII.Â  Statement Against Penal Interest by Unavailable Witness\r\nLucius maintains the trial court erred in excluding Michelle Buffâ€™s testimony that Maurice Sanders told her he shot the decedent.Â  We disagree.\r\nA.Â  Relevance\r\nFor evidence to be admissible, it must be relevant.Â  Rules 401 &amp; 402, SCRE; State v. Sweat, 362 S.C. 117, 606 S.E.2d 508 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Relevant evidence is defined as â€œevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.â€Â  Rule 401, SCRE; State v. Pagan, 357 S.C. 132, 142, 591 S.E.2d 646, 651 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Under Rule 401, evidence is relevant if it has a direct bearing upon and tends to establish or make more or less probable the matter in controversy.Â  In re Care and Treatment of Corley, 353 S.C. 202, 577 S.E.2d 451 (2003); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge, whose decision will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 551 S.E.2d 240 (2001).\r\nPrior to the Statensâ€™ joint trial, the State stipulated that neither Lucius nor Dushun actually shot Lee.Â  The State declared: â€œ[W]e are proceeding on the theory of accomplice liability . . . . Whoever the shooter is is not relevant.â€Â  Buff, the girlfriend of Limel Sims, would testify that she took Maurice Sanders to the Benedict College area to look for the gun.Â  In her statement to police, she revealed that, when she took him to the bus station, Sanders confessed to shooting a man at Benedict College because â€œthe guy he shot and some of his friends had jumped him at the mall.â€Â  She added that Sims confirmed Sanders shot Lee.Â  The trial court ruled the test for trustworthiness of the statement was not met, and the identity of the shooter was unimportant for the State to prove its case for aiding and abetting murder.\r\nBuffâ€™s testimony was not relevant.Â  The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding the evidence.\r\nB.Â  Analysis under Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE\r\nNontestimonial statements against the interest of the declarant at the time when made are admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable and the circumstances show that a reasonable person would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true.Â  See Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004).Â  Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE, provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nThe following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\n\r\n  \r\n(3) Statement against interest.Â  A statement which was at the time of its making so far contrary to the declarantâ€™s pecuniary or proprietary interest, or so far tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability, or to render invalid a claim by the declarant against another, that a reasonable person in the declarantâ€™s position would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true. . . . .\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe declaration against penal interest exception has been applied to the determination of whether a third party committed the crime charged instead of the defendant in a criminal case.Â  See State v. Doctor, 306 S.C. 527, 413 S.E.2d 36 (1992).Â  An abuse of discretion standard is applied to a trial judgeâ€™s ruling on the issue of whether a statement is admissible as a declaration against penal interest.Â  State v. Forney, 321 S.C. 353, 468 S.E.2d 641 (1996).\r\nHowever, â€œ[a] statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.â€Â  Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE; see also McClain v. Anderson Free Press, 232 S.C. 448, 468, 102 S.E.2d 750, 760 (1958) (Oxner, J., concurring).Â  A defendant seeking to offer a hearsay statement against interest bears the formidable burden of establishing that corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.Â  State v. Wannamaker, 346 S.C. 495, 552 S.E.2d 284 (2001).Â  Exculpatory evidence that is not corroborated with other evidence that clearly shows its trustworthiness is excluded.Â  Forney, 321 S.C. at 359-60, 468 S.E.2d at 645; State v. McKnight, 321 S.C. 230, 234, 467 S.E.2d 919, 921-22 (1996).Â  Whether a statement has been sufficiently corroborated is a question left to the discretion of the trial judge after considering the totality of the circumstances under which a declaration against penal interest was made.Â  State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 540 S.E.2d 464 (2000); State v. Kinloch, 338 S.C. 385, 526 S.E.2d 705 (2000).\r\nRule 804(b)(3) does not require that the information within the statement be clearly corroborated, it means only that there be corroborating circumstances which clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement itself, i.e., that the statement was actually made.Â  Kinloch, 338 S.C. at 389, 526 S.E.2d at 707.Â  The corroboration requirement â€œgoes not to the truth of the statementâ€™s contents, but rather to the making of the statement.â€Â  McDonald, 343 S.C. at 323, 540 S.E.2d at 466.Â  The corroboration requirement is a preliminary determination as to the statementâ€™s admissibility, not an ultimate determination about the statementâ€™s truth.Â  Kinloch, 338 S.C. at 389, 526 SE.2d at 707.\r\nIn State v. McKnight, evidence offered by a witness with a motive to testify against the alleged declarant was held not sufficiently trustworthy:\r\n\r\nFirst, the declarant in this case, Willie, was available to testify. . . . Moreover, Willie did not exercise any fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\r\nSecond, no corroborating evidence existed which clearly indicated the trustworthiness of Willieâ€™s statement against penal interest.Â  On the contrary, the evidence presented during the in camera hearing severely undermined that statementâ€™s trustworthiness.Â  Belser admitted that he felt Willie had wrongly put the blame on him for crimes actually committed by Willie. This statement suggested that Belser had a possible motive for attributing Chandlerâ€™s murder to Willie.Â  Belser also stated that when Willie confessed to the murder, he felt Willie was only joking.Â  Indeed, Willie himself admitted telling at least three different versions of his story at one time or another.\r\n\r\nId. at 234-35, 467 S.E.2d at 922.\r\nSanders was unavailable to testify due to the exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights.Â  Buff would testify that Sanders confessed to the murder, thereby exposing him to possible further criminal charges.Â  The only corroboration was from the eyewitness testimony of Brandon McCants, who testified that he saw Sanders shoot Lee, and Dushunâ€™s statement that he and Lucius withdrew.Â  However, McCants did not come forward with his information until two months after the incident, even though he was questioned by police much earlier; Dushun obviously had motive to lie; and, when arrested shortly after the shooting, Sanders tested negative for gunshot residue.Â  Lastly, but most importantly, Sims, Buffâ€™s boyfriend, was charged with the murder as well, and Buffâ€™s statement would exculpate him.Â  Therefore, she had motive to make up the story about Sandersâ€™ confession.\r\nBased on the totality of the circumstances, and because of the lack of corroboration and Buffâ€™s possible motivation to be untruthful, the trial court correctly excluded her testimony.Â  Lucius did not carry his burden of showing circumstances clearly corroborating the making of the statement.Â  See United States v. Salvador, 820 F.2d 558 (2d Cir. 1987) (stating inference of trustworthiness from proffered corroborating circumstances must be strong, not merely allowable, not an insignificant hurdle).Â  Moreover, the circumstances do not indicate that the statement was not fabricated.Â  See United States v. Bagley, 537 F.2d 162 (5th Cir. 1976) (excluding statement on basis of doubt as to whether it was made).Â  We affirm the trial courtâ€™s reasoning that, because the State conceded neither Staten brother was the shooter, showing Sanders as opposed to Sims was the shooter did nothing to aid the jury in its decision.Â  The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit the testimony.\r\nIII.Â  Jury Charge\r\nLucius contends the trial court erred in refusing to charge mere association and mere suspicion.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe law to be charged must be determined from the evidence presented at trial.Â  State v. Knoten, 347 S.C. 296, 555 S.E.2d 391 (2001); State v. Cole, 338 S.C. 97, 525 S.E.2d 511 (2000).Â  The judge is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina.Â  State v. Hughey, 339 S.C. 439, 529 S.E.2d 721 (2000).Â  In reviewing jury charges for error, we must consider the courtâ€™s jury charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.Â  State v. Adkins, 353 S.C. 312, 577 S.E.2d 460 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  A jury charge is correct if, when the charge is read as a whole, it contains the correct definition and adequately covers the law.Â  Id. at 318, 577 S.E.2d at 464.Â  To warrant reversal, a trial judgeâ€™s refusal to give a requested jury charge must be both erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant.Â  State v. Reese, 359 S.C. 260, 597 S.E.2d 169 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œFailure to give requested jury instructions is not prejudicial error where the instructions given afford the proper test for determining the issues.â€Â  State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 263, 565 S.E.2d 298, 304 (2002).\r\nLucius requested a charge on mere suspicion before the charge was given, and then objected to the charge when he believed the trial court insufficiently presented the law on mere suspicion to the jury.Â  Though the trial court did not specifically address mere suspicion, its charge on the whole, combined with the law on reasonable doubt and mere presence and knowledge, conveyed to the jury the notion that mere suspicion is insufficient for finding a defendant guilty.Â  Therefore, the trial courtâ€™s refusal to specifically charge mere suspicion was neither erroneous nor prejudicial to Lucius, as required by Burkhart.Â  See Burkhart, 350 S.C. at 263, 565 S.E.2d at 304.\r\nLucius never requested a charge on mere association before the trial court actually administered the charge.Â  Furthermore, he did not request such an instruction after the trial court had charged the jury with the law.Â  The trial court did not have an opportunity to rule upon the objection.Â  See State v. Ford, 334 S.C. 444, 513 S.E.2d 385 (Ct. App. 1999) (to preserve objection to jury charge, defendant must raise the issue at trial).Â  In addition, Rule 20(b) of the South Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure provides:\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding any request for legal instructions, the parties shall be given the opportunity to object to the giving or failure to give an instruction before the jury retires, but out of the hearing of the jury.Â  Any objection shall state distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds for objection.Â  Failure to object in accordance with this rule shall constitute a waiver of objection.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the issue is not preserved for appeal.Â  Furthermore, although Dushun objected to the trial courtâ€™s alleged failure to include a charge on mere association, an appellant may not preserve an issue for appeal by way of a co-defendantâ€™s objection.Â  See State v. Carriker, 269 S.C. 553, 555, 238 S.E.2d 678, 678 (1977) (â€œWhile appellantâ€™s co-defendant did object, the appellant may not utilize the objection of another defendant to gain review.â€).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, Luciusâ€™s conviction is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n ANDERSON, BEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The trial court declared a mistrial on Luciusâ€™s charge for murder.\r\n[2] Britt stated he was present when Lee and the Statens had a confrontation on the Saturday before the shooting.\r\n[3] 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (2004).\r\n[4] Lucius further claims the trial court erred in admitting the hearsay statements because they actually relate to a prior bad act, not an excited utterance involving â€œthe event.â€Â  However, this objection was not made at trial, and the trial court did not have an opportunity to rule upon the objection.Â  See State v. Simmons, 360 S.C. 33, 599 S.E.2d 448 (2004) (noting that, to be preserved for appellate review, issue must be raised and ruled upon in the trial court).Â  Therefore, the issue is not preserved for appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-164","title":"Leonard v.

Leonard, Appellant,\r\nv.\r\nKershaw County, State of South Carolina, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Kershaw County\r\nÂ J. Ernest Kinard, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-164\r\nSubmitted March 1, 2005 â€“ Filed March 7, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nGerald F. Smith, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nJ. Kennedy DuBose, Jr., of Camden, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Delores Leonard, a former part-time magistrate for Kershaw County, appeals the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of her action for unpaid wages.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nDelores Leonard became a part-time magistrate for Kershaw County in 1996 and served in that capacity until she resigned in April 2003.Â  During that time, Leonard requested on several occasions for the county to compensate her for the hours she spent â€œon-callâ€ in addition to her scheduled twenty hours per week.Â  In February 2003, Leonard filed an action for unpaid wages, alleging that the county only paid her for twenty hours a week, when in fact she worked additional hours for which the county had failed to compensate her.Â  At trial, Kershaw County filed a motion to dismiss based on the lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, which the trial court granted.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA trial judge in a civil matter may dismiss a claim when the defendant demonstrates the plaintiff has failed â€œto state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of actionâ€ in the pleadings filed with the court.Â  Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  The question to be considered on a motion to dismiss on the pleadings is whether, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the pleadings articulate any valid claim for relief.Â  Williams v. Condon, 347 S.C. 227, 232-233, 553 S.E.2d 496, 499 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Upon review of a grant of a motion to dismiss, the appellate court applies the same standard of review that was implemented by the trial court.Â  Oâ€™Laughlin v. Windham, 330 S.C. 379, 382, 498 S.E.2d 689, 691 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nLeonard argues that the trial court erred in finding the language of the Magistrateâ€™s Compensation Act is mandatory rather than discretionary and therefore not her only available remedy.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe complaint cited the Magistrateâ€™s Compensation Act for Leonardâ€™s entitlement to compensation for all hours worked, but requested relief under S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 41-10-10â€”110 (Supp. 2004), the Payment of Wages Act, which entitles employees to relief against an employer for failure to pay wages.Â  The trial court found that the Magistrateâ€™s Compensation Act governs magistrate payment and therefore provides the exclusive remedy to Leonard.Â  The act reads:\r\n\r\nA magistrate aggrieved by a ruling or action taken by a county or the governing body of the county concerning classification, reclassification, or compensation of magistrates based upon this chapter, or with respect to the operation of the magistratesâ€™ court system within the county, may petition the county governing body, in writing, for redress.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Â§ Ann. 22-8-50(A) (1989).Â  \r\nLeonard contends that the term â€œmayâ€ in the language of the statute renders it permissive and that since it is optional, she can therefore chose to seek her remedy under the Wage Payment Act.Â  The general rule of statutory construction is that a specific statute prevails over a more general one. Mims v. Alston, 312 S.C. 311, 313, 440 S.E.2d 357, 359 (1994).Â  The Payment of Wages Act is a general statute that applies to all employers in South Carolina, while the Magistrateâ€™s Compensation Act specifically addresses wage disputes between magistrates and counties.Â  Legislative intent is the supreme rule of statutory construction if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used, and that language must be construed in the light of the intended purpose of the statute.Â  McClanahan v. Richland County Council, 350 S.C. 433, 438, 567 S.E.2d 240, 242 (2002).Â  It is clear that the legislature intended for the Magistrates Compensation Act to cover everything its name implies.Â  It is only logical for Leonard, who based her right to compensation on the Magistrateâ€™s Compensation Act, to achieve her relief from that statute as well, particularly since the statute expressly provides cure for conflicts emerging between magistrates and their employers.Â  The term â€œmayâ€ merely demonstrates the legislatureâ€™s intent to give magistrates the option of redress.Â  \r\nWe hold that the Magistrateâ€™s Compensation Act provides an exclusive remedy for magistrates with disputes over wages and Leonard should have filed her claim pursuant to that act.Â  Therefore, the trial court correctly dismissed the case.\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n      \r\n  ANDERSON, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-165","title":"Long v.

Rosenfeld, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  James Neel Long (Husband) appeals the family courtâ€™s order denying his request to terminate or modify his obligation to pay alimony to his former wife, Suzannah Force Long (Wife), refusing to terminate his obligation to maintain a life insurance policy naming Wife as beneficiary, and refusing to award attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife divorced in 1998 and entered into a voluntary agreement that the family court incorporated into its divorce order.Â  Pursuant to the agreement, Husband deeded all rights to the marital residence to Wife, and Wife assumed sole responsibility for payment of the first mortgage.Â  Husband agreed to pay Wife periodic alimony in the amount of $1,100 per month.Â  The agreement stated the alimony was payable directly to Wife, was not considered income to Wife, and if Husband was late, Wife could compel payment through the family court without a hearing. Â The parties also agreed that: \r\n\r\n  [T]he completion of the formal education of both of the partiesâ€™ children and/or the satisfaction of the first mortgage on the marital residence referenced above, shall be considered a â€œchange of circumstanceâ€ for the parties; however, there is no agreement as to any type of specific monetary relief which will be afforded Husband upon the happening of these events.\r\n\r\nHusband also agreed to maintain $200,000 in life insurance with Wife and children as alternate beneficiaries as long as he was obligated to pay alimony.Â  \r\nIn August 2002, Wife initiated this action and sought to hold Husband in contempt for failure to pay alimony and requested an increase in alimony.Â  Husband counterclaimed seeking termination or modification of alimony based upon a change in circumstances. Both parties requested costs and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nThe family court issued an order denying both partiesâ€™ requests for modification of alimony.Â  The court found neither party had met the burden to warrant an increase or decrease in alimony.Â  Although the family court terminated Husbandâ€™s obligation to maintain a life insurance policy for the benefit of his children, the family court left intact Husbandâ€™s obligation to maintain life insurance for the benefit of his Wife because his alimony obligation was not terminated.Â  Additionally, the family court ordered each party to bear his or her own attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Husband appeals.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nQuestions regarding alimony lie within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Bryson v. Bryson, 347 S.C. 221, 224, 553 S.E.2d 493, 495 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the decision is controlled by some error of law or is based on findings of fact that are without evidentiary support.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alimony\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in failing to terminate or modify his alimony obligation.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn award of periodic alimony may be modified pursuant to section 20-3-170 of the South Carolina Code (1985). That statute provides:\r\n\r\n  Whenever [a spouse] . . . has been required to make his or her spouse any periodic payments of alimony and the circumstances of the parties or the financial ability of the spouse making the periodic payments shall have changed since the rendition of such judgment, either party may apply to the court which rendered the judgment for an order and judgment decreasing or increasing the amount of such alimony payments or terminating such payments . . . .\r\n\r\nTo justify modification or termination of an alimony award, the changes in circumstances must be substantial or material. Eubank v. Eubank, 347 S.C. 367, 372, 555 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nHusband argues that a change has occurred because Wife satisfied the mortgage on the marital residence and voluntarily retired early at age fifty-three, thereby diminishing her income.Â  However, Wife asserted that during the marriage the parties had planned for her to retire from her job as a full-time teacher when she reached retirement age.Â  At the time of the divorce, Wife earned a gross monthly income of $2,859, and her monthly expenses totaled $3,023.50.Â  At the time of the hearing, she received a monthly retirement benefit of $1,802.47, and her monthly expenses had increased to $3,235.67.Â  At the time of the divorce, Husband earned a gross monthly income of $7,500, subject to monthly withholding for income taxes, Social Security, and insurance.Â  His gross monthly expenses were $4,452, including $2,000 he paid in alimony and child support.Â  At the time of the final hearing, Husbandâ€™s gross monthly income had increased to $9,083.Â  His monthly gross expenses included a $2,293.97 monthly mortgage payment on the house he shares with his current wife.Â  \r\nPursuant to the partiesâ€™ agreement, completion of the childrenâ€™s education or the mortgage satisfaction only indicates a circumstance when alimony may be reviewed, specifically leaving the ultimate decision to the discretion of the family court.Â  The agreement did not provide for a conclusive change upon the mere occurrence of one of these stipulations.Â  The family court found Husband did not meet his burden to warrant a reduction in alimony.Â  Although Wife no longer has a mortgage payment, she still pays taxes and insurance and her overall expenses have increased slightly.Â  These factors, coupled with the fact that Husbandâ€™s gross monthly income has increased substantially, indicate no abuse of discretion by the family court in refusing modification.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life Insurance\r\nHusband also argues the family court erred by failing to terminate his obligation to maintain life insurance naming Wife as the beneficiary.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn the original divorce action, the parties reached an agreement resolving contested issues that the family court incorporated into its order.Â  The family court found the parties entered into the agreement freely and voluntarily, had ample time to consider every provision of the agreement, and fully understood the agreement.Â  Husband agreed, pursuant to the agreement, that he would maintain a life insurance policy naming Wife as beneficiary for so long as his obligation to pay alimony remained.Â  Since we hold the family court did not err in refusing to modify alimony, the family court correctly ordered Husband to maintain the life insurance policy as previously ordered.\r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nHusband argues the family court erred by refusing to award him attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œOrdinarily, the award of attorney fees lies within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.â€ McElveen v. McElveen, 332 S.C. 583, 601, 506 S.E.2d 1, 10 (Ct. App. 1998). The factors to be considered in awarding reasonable attorney fees and costs include: (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) the professional standing of counsel; (4) the contingency of compensation; (5) the beneficial results obtained; and (6) the customary legal fees for similar services. Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).Â  In deciding whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court should consider the partiesâ€™ ability to pay their own fees, the beneficial results obtained by counsel, the respective financial conditions of the parties, and the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).\r\nWe find the family court properly considered the factors in declining to award attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We disagree with Husbandâ€™s contention the family court erred in finding both he and Wife achieved beneficial results.Â  Wife obtained beneficial results in regard to both alimony and the life insurance policy. Therefore, we find no abuse of discretion in the family courtâ€™s decision regarding the award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\n ANDERSON, BEATTY, SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-166","title":"State v.

Breeden, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-166\r\nSubmitted February 1, 2005 â€“ Filed March 7, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Eleanor Duffy Cleary, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, and Assistant Attorney General Derrick K. McFarland, all of Columbia; and Solicitor John Gregory Hembree, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: James Johnson appeals the lower courtâ€™s denial of his directed verdict motion.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn the night of July 3 and the early morning of July 4, 2002, James Johnson, Gregory Ray, and Anthony Johnson were in Myrtle Beach when they met Jason Ernst, who attempted to sell them ecstasy pills.Â  James, Gregory, and Anthony then proceeded to abduct Ernst, steal his pills and wallet, and force him to give them his Personal Identification Number to his debit card.Â  The men then drove to several Automatic Teller Machines (ATM) and withdrew cash, then claimed they dropped Ernst off on an isolated highway.Â  Ernstâ€™s dead body was found underneath a Highway 22 ramp, precisely where James stated they had let Ernst out of their vehicle.Â  The death occurred as a result of a fall from a bridge.Â  In September and November of 2002, the Horry County grand jury indicted James Johnson on four counts: murder, kidnapping, strong armed robbery, and financial card fraud.Â  After the State presented its case at trial, Johnson made a motion for directed verdict on all charges, which the trial court denied. Â The jury found James guilty and the trial judge sentenced him to life imprisonment for the murder.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight. State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 555, 564 S.E.2d 87, 92 (2002).Â  When reviewing a denial of a directed verdict, this Court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the State. State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 46, 515 S.E.2d 525, 531 (1999). If there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, an appellate court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury. State v. Harris, 351 S.C. 643, 653, 572 S.E.2d 267, 273 (2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nJames argues the trial court erred by refusing to direct a verdict of acquittal on the charge of murder because the State did not introduce any direct or circumstantial evidence that reasonably tended to prove guilt.Â  We disagree.\r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, sufficient evidence exists to demonstrate the trial judge correctly sent the case to the jury.Â  The trial judge relied upon the defendantâ€™s voluntary statement to police when deciding to deny the directed verdict motion.Â  We also feel this piece of evidence provided an evidentiary trail indicating at the very least, that James participated in the crimes immediately preceding the death of Ernst.Â  James admitted to driving the car after Ernst was abducted and robbed of cash and his ATM card.Â  James also stated that he took the ecstasy pills from Ernst and later dropped him off on a bridge in an area that that by his description, was identical to the location where the victimâ€™s body was found.Â  Furthermore, James claimed that the three men let Ernst out of the vehicle and the vehicle then struck Ernst in a manner James described as a â€œloud thumpâ€ and not a mere â€œtap.â€Â  Authorities also found Anthonyâ€™s wallet in Ernstâ€™s pocket.Â  \r\nA forensic pathologist testified that the victimâ€™s injuries were consistent with a fall from a high object, but in his opinion, inconsistent with suicide.Â  A senior examiner with the Department of Latent Prints of the State Law Enforcement Division testified that the victimâ€™s wounds were consistent with a struggle and with being dragged across the pavement on the bridge and he also ruled out a possible fall as a result of an automobile collision.Â  \r\nJames concedes that the stateâ€™s evidence proves his involvement in the kidnapping and robbery but that no evidence places him at the scene of the murder and cites State v. Martin, 340 S.C. 597, 533 S.E.2d 572 (2000), where the supreme court reversed a denial of a directed verdict when the Stateâ€™s evidence failed to place the defendant at the scene. See also State v. Schrock, 283 S.C. 129, 322 S.E.2d 450 (1984).Â  These cases however, create a much more tenuous link between the respective defendants and the scenes of the crime.Â Â  In the case at bar, James admitted to the officer who took his statement to being at the scene and went so far as to describe the location where Ernst plunged to his death.[2]Â  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we find substantial evidence exists for the trial judge to have denied the directed verdict motion.Â  â€œ[T]he trial judge must submit the case to the jury if there is any substantial circumstantial evidence . . . from which his guilt may be fairly or logically deduced.â€Â  State v. Buckmon, 347 S.C. 316, 322, 555 S.E.2d 402, 405 (2001). \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, BEATTY, and SHORT JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Sergeant Richard Bonneyâ€™s testimony: \r\n\r\nQ.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in your description and your understanding of the conversation was the place that the defendant says he left the victim out of the car the same place the body was found?\r\nA.Â Â Â Â  Yes, it is. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-167","title":"McLemore V.

Nichols and Melvin Dean Bannister, both of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nMary Dreher, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Reginald McLemore appeals the family courtâ€™s order denying his request for reimbursement for child support paid to Mary Dreher. \r\nWe affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nAfter many years of knowing each another, Dreher and McLemore engaged in a sexual relationship.Â  In 1991, Dreher gave birth to a daughter, Brianna.Â  Following Briannaâ€™s birth, Dreher accepted money from McLemore on multiple occasions over an approximate eight-year period.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn 2002, McLemore petitioned the family court asserting he was Briannaâ€™s father and requesting visitation.Â  McLemore subsequently amended his complaint requesting a paternity test, and alternatively, if the paternity test indicated he was not Briannaâ€™s father, requesting reimbursement for child support paid.Â  After finding that Dreher had for some time acknowledged McLemore was the childâ€™s father and McLemore had paid child support to Dreher, the family court issued a temporary order granting McLemoreâ€™s request for visitation.Â  Dreher then filed an answer and counterclaim stating she informed McLemore on numerous occasions that another man, not McLemore, was Briannaâ€™s father.Â  Dreher also requested attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  The family court conducted a hearing, at which Dreher requested the family court reconsider its temporary order.Â  As a result of that hearing, the family court issued an order requiring McLemore to submit to a paternity test and suspending his right to visitation pending a further order of the court.Â  Subsequently, the family court issued a final order denying McLemoreâ€™s request for visitation after finding he was not Briannaâ€™s father, and denying McLemoreâ€™s request for reimbursement after finding the payments he made to Dreher were not child support.Â  Additionally, the family court ordered McLemore to pay eight hundred dollars in attorneyâ€™s fees payable in monthly installments of one hundred dollars.Â  McLemore filed a motion to reconsider.Â  After a hearing on this motion, the family court issued an order reducing McLemoreâ€™s payment of attorneyâ€™s fees to fifty dollars per month.Â  McLemore appeals from the family courtâ€™s order. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing a decision by the family court, this court has the authority to find the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Bragg v. Bragg, 347 S.C. 16, 21, 553 S.E.2d 251, 254 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  However, we are not required to disregard the findings of the family court or ignore the fact that the family court saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position to evaluate the credibility and weigh their testimony.Â  Id. at 21-22, 553 S.E.2d at 254.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Paternity \r\nMcLemore argues the family court erred by refusing to grant him reimbursement for child support paid to Dreher.Â  We disagree.\r\nMcLemore asserts Dreher misled him into thinking Brianna was his child and the payments he made to Dreher were child support for Brianna.Â  Furthermore, McLemore contends the only explanation for his continued payments to Dreher was his belief that he was Briannaâ€™s father.Â  In addition, he argues the decision to abandon his claim for visitation after he discovered he was not Briannaâ€™s father supports his position.Â Â  Dreher, however, testified she told McLemore several times he was not Briannaâ€™s father.Â  Barbara Richardson, a friend of Dreherâ€™s, confirmed she visited with Dreher shortly after Briannaâ€™s birth and witnessed Dreher inform McLemore that he was not the father.Â  Giving weight to the family court, we find the courtâ€™s determination that McLemore knew prior to the filing of his cause of action that Brianna was not his child was reasonable based on the evidence.Â  \r\nII.Â  Child Support\r\nMcLemore contends because Dreher did not challenge the nature of the payments as child support, as determined by the family court in its temporary order, the status of the payments as child support is the law of the case.Â  We disagree. \r\nContrary to McLemoreâ€™s assertion, the family courtâ€™s findings of facts in a temporary order do not become the law of the case.Â  Temporary orders are issued without prejudice to the rights of the parties at the final hearing.Â \r\nRimer v. Rimer, Â­361 S.C. 521, 527 n.6, 605 S.E.2d 572, 575 n.6 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Therefore, we find the family court did not err in making a determination that the payments by McLemore to Dreher were not child support in its final order.Â Â  \r\nIII. Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nMcLemore argues the family court erred in awarding Dreher eight hundred dollars in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Specifically, McLemore complains the family court did not consider the necessary factors in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nSection 20-7-420(38) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004), provides that attorneyâ€™s fees may be awarded in an action brought in family court.Â  â€œAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge and should not be disturbed on appeal unless there is an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 533, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004).Â  In determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the court should consider each partyâ€™s ability to pay, whether beneficial results were obtained by the attorney, the financial conditions of the parties, and the effect of the attorneyâ€™s fees on each party.Â  Griffith v. Griffith, 332 S.C. 630, 645, 506 S.E.2d 526, 534 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  In determining what amount of attorneyâ€™s fees should be awarded, the court should consider â€œthe nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered; the time necessarily devoted to the case; the professional standing of counsel; the contingency of compensation; the beneficial results obtained; and the customary legal fees for similar services.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nOur review of the record indicates the family court considered the necessary factors in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to Dreher.Â  At the hearing on McLemoreâ€™s motion to reconsider and in response to McLemoreâ€™s argument that he did not have the ability to pay the attorneyâ€™s fees awarded to Dreher, the family court judge stated he considered all factors, not just the ability to pay.Â  Furthermore, after determining McLemoreâ€™s monthly income, the judge reduced his monthly payments by half.Â  In addition, the record contains an affidavit supplied by Dreherâ€™s attorney specifying her experience and expertise, her hourly rate, and the time she spent working on this case.Â  We find the family court considered all of the appropriate factors and did not abuse its discretion.Â  \r\n AFFRIMED.&nbsp; \r\nANDERSON, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-168","title":"State v.

Thomas, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-171\r\nHeard January 12, 2005 â€“ Filed March 9, 2005Â Â \r\n\r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nBrown W. Johnson, of Florence, for Appellant HS, Inc.\r\nCharlie J. Blake, Jr., of Florence, for Appellants Florence County and Karl Gene Smith.\r\nKermit S. King, and David C. Shea, both of Columbia, for Respondent GB&amp;S Corporation.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The County of Florence through its treasurer, Karl Gene Smith (collectively, the County) sold GB&amp;S Corporation property at a tax sale, after the propertyâ€™s former owner, HS, Inc., became delinquent in taxes owed on the property.Â  GB&amp;S brought this declaratory judgment action seeking to require the County to execute and deliver a tax deed for the property.Â  The County alone defended the matter in pre-trial proceedings, with HSâ€™s informal assistance, until the circuit court granted summary judgment to GB&amp;S.Â  HS intervened during the pendency of the Countyâ€™s motion for reconsideration, which was denied.Â  HSâ€”and presumably the Countyâ€”now appeal the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment against the County.Â  We dismiss this appeal, finding: (1) the County abandoned its defense of this action in the circuit court; and (2) HS, which has never filed a pleading, failed to properly raise any of the issues on appeal before the circuit court.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nGB&amp;S purchased property in Florence County through a tax sale in October 1996.Â Â  The property had been subject to the tax sale because its former owner, HS, owed delinquent taxes from the years 1994 and 1995.Â  However, the County later found the tax sale invalid and set it aside.\r\nIn June 1998, GB&amp;S brought the present action against the County seeking declaratory judgment that the sale was valid.Â  The action also sought an order requiring that the County execute and deliver to GB&amp;S a tax deed for the property.\r\nThe County answered in July 1998.Â  Its sole argument was the tax sale was invalid because the County failed to comply with South Carolina Code section 12-45-410, which requires â€œ[a]ny taxes paid by a delinquent taxpayer to a county treasurer or tax collector must be applied to the oldest chronological delinquency on the property for which payment was intended.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-45-410 (2000) (the statute).Â  Specifically, the County argued it erroneously applied money paid by HS in 1996 to taxes due for the 1995 tax year rather than the older debt from the 1994 tax year, and that its non-compliance with the statute rendered the tax sale invalid.Â  Additionally, it admitted paragraph twelve of GB&amp;Sâ€™s complaint that asserted HS received notice of the levy.Â  \r\nIn May 1999, GB&amp;S moved for summary judgment, arguing the tax sale was valid as a matter of law because the undisputed facts indicated that even if the County had properly applied HSâ€™s delinquent tax payments pursuant to the statute, a deficiency would have remained.Â  The County responded, arguing its failure to strictly comply with the statute precluded a finding that GB&amp;S was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.Â  HS elected not to intervene at this time, opting instead to monitor the litigation and lend assistance to the County.Â  \r\nAt the summary judgment hearing in January 2000, only attorneys representing GB&amp;S and the County appeared.Â  The arguments before the able circuit judge were confined to those matters arising from the Countyâ€™s failure to strictly comply with section 12-45-410.Â  Although the issue of notice was conceded in the Countyâ€™s answer, a memorandum submitted to the circuit court contained a general challenge to the issue of proper notice.Â  Contrary to the admission in the Countyâ€™s answer, the County furnished an affidavitâ€”prepared by an owner of HSâ€”contending that service on â€œDonice Majorsâ€ was insufficient, for she â€œhas never been an agent or in any way connected with HS, Inc.â€Â  The Countyâ€™s memorandum conversely referred to Donice Majors as an â€œagent for HS, Inc.â€Â  The issue of noticeâ€”with the Countyâ€™s conflicting submissionsâ€”was not pursued at the hearing and the circuit court addressed only the issue argued at the hearing, that is, the Countyâ€™s failure to strictly comply with section 12-45-410.Â  \r\nThe circuit court granted summary judgment to GB&amp;S in March 2000, finding that even if the County had properly applied section 12-45-410, â€œthere would still have been due and owing an amount in excess of $406 for the tax year 1994â€ and $1,437.61 in taxes for 1995.Â  The court also found that â€œ[a]t no time prior to the tax sale were the property taxes paid in full.â€Â  The court declared the sale valid and ordered the County to issue a tax deed to GB&amp;S.\r\nThe County made a motion to amend in March 2000.Â  Over three years later, HS filed a memorandum in support of the Countyâ€™s motion.\r\nDuring the pendency of the courtâ€™s decision on the Countyâ€™s motion for reconsideration, the County informed counsel for HS that it did not wish to continue participating in the litigation and the County â€œwas not particularly interested in seeing this decision overturned.â€Â  In response, HS made a motion to intervene in April 2000.Â  In an affidavit accompanying the motion, counsel for HS stated, among other things:\r\n\r\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [GB&amp;Sâ€™s] suit did not include as a party HS, Inc., the former owner of the property and the delinquent taxpayer.\r\nâ€¦\r\n6.Â Â Â Â Â Â  HS, Inc. assisted [the County] in this action to the extent of providing information and an affidavit from the owner of HS, Inc. with the assurance from the [the County]Â  that the interest of HS, Inc. would be protected and the [the County] would vigorously defend the suit.\r\n7.Â Â Â Â Â Â  After the Court issued a summary judgment in favor ofÂ  [GB&amp;S], counsel for [the County] for the first time informed me that [the County] was not interested in seeing this decision overturned. Â Therefore, in order to protect its interest, HS, Inc. should be allowed to intervene pursuant to Rule 24(a)(2) since HS, Inc. has an interest in the property and its interest will not be adequately represented by the existing party.Â  In fact, it appears the suit may be a friendly suit between the existing parties.\r\n\r\nJudge Casey Manning granted HSâ€™s motion to intervene in October 2002.Â  \r\nIn June 2003, the circuit court held a hearing on the Countyâ€™s motion for reconsideration, at which counsel for GB&amp;S and HS were present.Â  However, â€œno representative of, or attorney for, County of Florence appearedâ€ in spite of having received proper notice.Â  The court denied the motion for reconsideration.\r\nHS appealed, and the County, at the behest of HS, executed the notice of appeal.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThis appeal presents a procedural morass.Â  HS seeks to posture itself as a proper party on appeal by claiming to represent not only its interests but also the interests of the County.Â  We reject the suggestion by counsel for HS at oral argument that he is also counsel of record for the County.Â  During the preliminary stages of the appeal process, GB&amp;S sought dismissal of this appeal.[1]Â  Because the County had not filed an initial brief, this court sought to determine if the County claimed an interest in the appeal.Â  The court was informed that the Appellants had filed a joint initial brief.Â  Counsel for the Countyâ€”as listed in the caption of this opinionâ€”wrote the following letter to this courtâ€™s docketing clerk:\r\n\r\nI represent the County of Florence and Karl Gene Smith â€¦ My clients and HS, Inc. have filed a joint Brief, and I did not intend to file a separate brief. Please advise if you need any additional information.\r\n\r\nOur review of the file further reveals the absence of a motion seeking substitution of counsel.Â  See Rule 235, SCACR (â€œThe attorneys â€¦ of the respective parties in the court below shall be deemed the attorneys â€¦ of the same parties in the appellate court until withdrawal is approvedâ€).Â  There is no support for the position that counsel for HS is counsel of record for the County.\r\nWe address the Appellants separately.\r\nThe County\r\nThe record leaves no doubt that the County abandoned its opposition to the grant of summary judgment to GB&amp;S.Â  Following the grant of summary judgment and the filing of its reconsideration motion, the County, through counsel, made it perfectly clear that it was â€œnot interestedâ€ in seeking reversal of the circuit courtâ€™s summary judgment decision.Â  Counsel for the County failed to appear at the hearing on its reconsideration motion.Â  Counsel for the County even failed to appear at oral argument in this court.Â  A party may not abandon its position in the trial court and then resurrect it on appeal. Â Â See State v. Benton, 338 S.C. 151, 156-57, 526 S.E.2d 228, 231 (2000), cert. denied 530 U.S. 1209 (2000) (An issue conceded in the trial court cannot be argued on appeal); Ex parte McMillan, 319 S.C. 331, 335, 461 S.E.2d 43, 45 (1995) (A party cannot acquiesce to an issue at trial and then complain on appeal).\r\nHS\r\nAt the outset, HS sought to protect its interest by monitoring the litigation.Â  HS thus elected to allow the County to protect its interest.Â  Only when the County decided to throw the towel in did HS seek to intervene as a party pursuant to Rule 24, SCRCP.[2]Â  HS was granted leave to intervene and responded by filing a â€œmemorandum in support of motion to amend findings and judgmentâ€ in support of GB&amp;Sâ€™s reconsideration motion.Â  The circuit court, at the hearing on the Countyâ€™s reconsideration motion, noted that HS had filed no â€œpleadingâ€ as mandated by Rule 24(c), SCRCP.[3]Â  The circuit court further found:\r\n\r\nHS, Inc.[] has filed no pleading and therefore neither has raised nor joined any issue with [GB&amp;S]; and HS, Inc.[] has filed no motion for reconsideration; and in the view of this Court, HS, Inc.[] has nothing pending before this Court as to which counsel for HS, Inc.[] should be permitted to argue or as to which the undersigned needs to render a decision.\r\n\r\nWe concur with the finding of the circuit court in this regard.Â  We do, however, accept HSâ€™s argument that its interest in the underlying property gave it standing to intervene.Â  Yet standing, by itself, does not a lawsuit make, nor does it satisfy all the requirements of intervention.Â  A party must take all proper steps to properly avail itself of the courts of this state.Â  HS has failed to do so and acknowledged at oral argument its noncompliance with Rule 24.\r\nWe further reject for two reasons the attempt of HS to borrow the appellate rights of the County.Â  First, an appellant may not preserve an issue for appeal by way of a co-defendantâ€™s objection.Â  Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 487 S.E.2d 187 (1997).Â  Secondly, the Countyâ€”having abandoned in the circuit court its right to challenge the grant of summary judgmentâ€”has no appellate rights from which to borrow. \r\nThis appeal is \r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED.\r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  Judge Cureton, on behalf of this court, denied the motion of GB&amp;S â€œto quash HS, Inc.â€™s notice of appeal,â€ with leave to renew the motion in its brief.Â  GB&amp;S reasserted its motion to â€œquashâ€ in its brief.\r\n[2] Â Â Â Â Â Â  HS never sought to be substituted for the County.\r\n[3] Â Â Â Â Â Â  HS has never filed a pleading in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-172","title":"State v.

Kinard Johnson, Jr., Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No.Â  2005-UP-173\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2005 â€“ Filed March 9, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nBrian A. DiMarco, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nKim R. Varner, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Brian DiMarco (Husband) petitioned the family court for a decrease in his child support obligation paid to his former wife, Cheryl DiMarco (Wife).Â  The family court denied Husbandâ€™s requests and awarded Wife attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Husband appeals and we affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband filed a petition with the family court to, among other requests, decrease the amount of his child support obligation based on a change in circumstances.Â  After a hearing, the family court issued a temporary order denying Husbandâ€™s request based on his failure to supply the court with a financial declaration.Â  In addition to denying Husbandâ€™s other requests, the family court awarded Wife $3,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The family court based its decision to award attorneyâ€™s fees on Wifeâ€™s need to investigate Husbandâ€™s income, the numerous allegations made by Husband that Wife would be required to defend, and the fact Husband had the ability to pay and Wifeâ€™s inability to pay.Â  Husband filed a motion to reconsider, which the family court denied.Â  A final order has been issued resolving the dispute between the parties.Â  Husband appeals the temporary order.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nThe award of attorneyâ€™s fees is a matter within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be overturned absent a showing of abuse of discretion.Â  Haselden v. Haselden, 347 S.C. 48, 61, 552 S.E.2d 329, 336 (Ct. App. 2001). Husband asserts four arguments to support his contention the family court erred in awarding Wife attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nHusband first argues that the family court judge has an alleged history of abusing his discretion in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees and cites only one instance where the judge was overruled by this court on that issue.Â  This argument is wholly without merit.Â  Whether the family court judge who presided over this case has been found to have abused his discretion once or one hundred times by an appellate court is irrelevant and has absolutely no bearing upon the case currently before us.Â  We decide the case based on the record that stands before us and refuse to consider this argument by Husband.\r\nSecondly, Husband argues he was not given an opportunity to contest the amount of the attorneyâ€™s fees awarded because Wife did not make a written request for attorneyâ€™s fees and she did not submit an attorney fee affidavit.Â  However, Husband failed to provide us with any of Wifeâ€™s pleadings and affidavits.[2]Â  \r\nConsidering Husbandâ€™s argument in light of the inadequate record, we find it was not properly preserved for appeal.Â  The record reflects Wifeâ€™s attorney requested attorneyâ€™s fees at the hearing.Â  The record does not indicate Husband objected to Wifeâ€™s request for attorney fees, nor does it indicate he objected to the absence of an attorney fee affidavit.Â  â€œA contemporaneous objection is required to properly preserve an error for appellate review.Â  The failure to make an objection at the time evidence is offered constitutes a waiver of the right to object.â€Â  Doe v. S.B.M., 327 S.C. 352, 356, 488 S.E.2d 878, 880 (Ct. App. 1997) (internal citations omitted).Â Â  Husband failed to preserve this argument for appeal and we are unable to address it.Â  \r\nHusband also claims the family court abused its discretion in not considering the necessary factors in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  When deciding whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the court should consider each partyâ€™s ability to pay, whether beneficial results were obtained by the attorney, the financial conditions of the parties, and the effect of the attorneyâ€™s fees on each party.Â  Griffith v. Griffith, 332 S.C. 630, 645, 506 S.E.2d 526, 534 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  In determining what amount of attorneyâ€™s fees should be awarded, the court should consider â€œthe nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered; the time necessarily devoted to the case; the professional standing of counsel; the contingency of compensation; the beneficial results obtained; and the customary legal fees for similar services.â€Â  Id. at 645, 506 S.E.2d at 534.Â  The order reflects the court considered and explicitly cited the necessary factors and we therefore find the family court did not abuse its discretion.\r\nHusband also argues the family court erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees because the family court based its determination of Wifeâ€™s ability to pay on fraudulent information.Â  The family courtâ€™s order did not address what it relied on in determining Wifeâ€™s ability pay her attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Therefore, the family court did not specifically rule on this issue and Husband did not include this argument in his motion for reconsideration.Â  In order for an issue to be preserved for appellate review, with few exceptions, it must be raised and ruled upon by the trial judge.Â \r\nLucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505, 511, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004).Â  When a trial court makes a general ruling on an issue, but does not address the specific argument raised by the an appellant, the appellate court cannot consider the argument on appeal.Â \r\nNoisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991).Â  Accordingly, we are unable to address it upon review.Â  \r\nII. Reduction in Husbandâ€™s Child Support\r\nHusband also argues the family court abused its discretion in failing to reduce his child support obligation.Â  He contends on appeal that he is entitled to a reduction because the partiesâ€™ oldest child had reached the age of majority prior to the initiation of this action.Â  â€œ[A] parentâ€™s obligation to pay child support extends until the child reaches majority, become self-supporting, or marries, then ends by operation of law.â€Â  Purdy v. Purdy, 353 S.C. 400, 403, 578 S.E.2d 30, 31 (Ct. App. 2003); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(17) (Supp. 2004).Â  However, the record indicates Husbandâ€™s only argument for a reduction of child support at the hearing was based on a change in circumstances argument.Â  Therefore, Husband did not raise this issue to the family court, and thus, it was not ruled upon nor properly preserved for our review. \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ. concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The initial record contained only Husbandâ€™s complaint, the family courtâ€™s temporary order, the hearing transcript, and Husbandâ€™s motion for reconsideration.Â  Husband subsequently provided the final order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-174","title":"Suber v.

Barber, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-174\r\nSubmitted March 1, 2005 â€“ Filed March 9, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJames H. Dickey, of Atlanta, for Appellant.\r\nRobert A. McKenzie, Gary H. Johnson, II, and Robert Walton Buffington, all of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Ida Mae Suber appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order dismissing her negligence claim against Dealva Taundolyn Suber and Helen Reese Bailey (Respondents) on the ground an identical case was already pending in circuit court.Â  We affirm.[1]  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn September 29, 2000, Suber filed an action for negligence against Respondents in the Richland County Court of Common Pleas for injuries she sustained in an automobile accident that occurred on October 3, 1997.Â  Suber was a passenger in the vehicle driven by Dealva Taundolyn Suber, and Helen Reese Bailey was the driver of the other vehicle.Â  Because Suberâ€™s attorney, James Dickey, failed to attend the scheduled depositions, Respondents filed motions to dismiss for failure to prosecute pursuant to Rule 41(b) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.[2]Â  Circuit Court Judge Thomas W. Cooper, Jr., scheduled a hearing on May 17, 2001, but Dickey did not attend.Â  Judge Cooper issued a rule to show cause and ordered Dickeyâ€™s appearance before the court.Â  When Dickey failed to appear, Judge Cooper granted the motion to dismiss in a form order.Â  On August 2, 2001, Judge Cooper issued a formal order dismissing the action against Respondents without prejudice on the condition that Suber would have to pay attorneyâ€™s fees and costs in the amount of $500 to Respondentsâ€™ counsel before filing another action against Respondents.[3]Â  Thereafter, Suber filed a motion for reconsideration pursuant to Rule 59(e) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  The motion is still pending. \r\nOn August 1, 2002, Suber filed the instant lawsuit in the Richland County Court of Common Pleas.Â  The allegations against Respondents arise out of the same automobile accident and are identical to those in the earlier action.Â  Respondents again filed motions to dismiss.Â  In their motions, Respondents asserted the action should be dismissed on the following grounds:Â  (1). the second action was barred by the three-year statute of limitations; (2). Suber had not complied with the requirements of Judge Cooperâ€™s order with respect to the payment of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs to Respondentsâ€™ attorneys; and (3). Suber had not effectuated proper service of process. \r\nOn January 9, 2003, Circuit Court Judge James R. Barber, III, heard arguments on Respondentsâ€™ motions to dismiss.Â  Subsequently, Judge Barber issued an order granting Respondentsâ€™ motions.Â  Specifically, Judge Barber found the current action involved the same parties seeking the same relief as in the initial lawsuit.Â  Thus, he found that if Suber prevailed on her Rule 59(e) motion, the initial action would be viable and would proceed to its conclusion.Â  Additionally, he held that if Judge Cooper denied the pending motion, Suber had not complied with the requirements set forth in Judge Cooperâ€™s order.Â  In a form order, Judge Barber denied Suberâ€™s motion for reconsideration.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nSuber argues Judge Barber abused his discretion in dismissing her second lawsuit based upon the â€œnon-finalâ€ order of Judge Cooper.Â  Because Suberâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion had not been ruled upon by Judge Cooper, Suber contends Judge Barber was required to stay the proceeding before ruling on the instant action.Â  Furthermore, Suber asserts Judge Barber failed to properly review the file of the original action in reaching his decision. Â Finally, Suber claims Judge Barber erred in ruling prior to hearing Suberâ€™s counselâ€™s argument regarding a stay of the proceeding.[4] Â We disagree.\r\nInitially, we disagree with Suberâ€™s contention that Judge Barber relied on Judge Cooperâ€™s non-final order in dismissing the case.Â  Because Judge Cooper had not ruled on Suberâ€™s prior motion, the original lawsuit involving the same parties and request for relief was still pending in the circuit court.[5]Â  Thus, Judge Barber properly dismissed the case because the same two actions would impermissibly be proceeding in circuit court.Â  See Rule 12(b)(8), SCRCP (A trial court may dismiss an action where â€œanother action is pending between the same parties for the same claim.â€); cf. Wessinger v. Rauch, 288 S.C. 157, 160, 341 S.E.2d 643, 644 (Ct. App. 1986) (â€œAs a general rule, courts will not entertain an action for declaratory judgment if there is pending, at the time the action is commenced, another action between the same parties in which the same issues presented in the action for declaratory judgment can be adjudicated.â€).\r\nWith respect to Suberâ€™s assertion that Judge Barber did not review the file from the earlier action, we find this argument to be without merit.Â  Our review of the record reveals that Respondents provided Judge Barber with a copy of Judge Cooperâ€™s order.Â  Furthermore, Suberâ€™s attorney acknowledged the substance of the order in that he conceded:Â  (1). the Rule 59(e) motion was still pending; (2). the lawsuits were identical; and (3). he had not complied with the condition precedent ordered by Judge Cooper.\r\nFinally, we question whether Suberâ€™s claim that her counsel was not provided sufficient time to present the case is preserved for our review.Â  Our review of the record does not reveal that Suberâ€™s attorney raised this argument to Judge Barber.Â  Furthermore, Suberâ€™s argument in her brief is conclusory and is not supported by any specific citations to authority.Â  Therefore, it is not properly before this court.Â  See Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (â€œIt is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.â€); First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (stating appellant was deemed to have abandoned issue for which he failed to provide any argument or supporting authority); Glasscock, Inc. v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d 689, 691 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œ[S]hort, conclusory statements made without supporting authority are deemed abandoned on appeal and therefore not presented for review.â€).Â  \r\nIn any event, we find this argument to be without merit.Â  During the hearing, Suberâ€™s attorney agreed with the essential facts stated by opposing counsel.Â  He informed the court that the Rule 59(e) motion in the initial lawsuit had not been ruled upon and, therefore, the current lawsuit should be held in abeyance.Â  After hearing these statements, the court questioned Suberâ€™s attorney whether the second lawsuit was â€œa duplicationâ€ of the first lawsuit.Â  Based upon Suberâ€™s attorneyâ€™s response, the court stated it was going to dismiss the suit due to the identical pending lawsuit and the fact that the required attorneyâ€™s fees and costs had not been paid before filing the second lawsuit. Â Based upon our reading of what transpired during the hearing, we find the court did not abuse its discretion given it provided Suberâ€™s attorney an opportunity to present arguments relevant to the disposition of the case.Â  See Sullivan v. Davis, 317 S.C. 462, 465, 454 S.E.2d 907, 909 (Ct. App. 1995) (finding trial court has discretion in deciding whether to admit or exclude evidence; the courtâ€™s decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent clear showings of both abuse and prejudice); see also State v. Penland, 275 S.C. 537, 539, 273 S.E.2d 765, 766 (1981)(holding the control of argument is normally within the discretion of the trial court, and we will not disturb its ruling where there is no abuse of discretion).\r\nThus, we find Judge Barber was well informed of the status of the case and properly dismissed Suberâ€™s second lawsuit pursuant to Rule 12(b)(8).\r\nII.\r\nAs an additional sustaining ground, Respondents assert this court should affirm Judge Barberâ€™s order because Suberâ€™s second lawsuit is barred by the three-year statute of limitations.Â  We agree. \r\nAlthough Judge Barber did not explicitly rule on this issue it was raised by Respondents in their motions to dismiss and was noted in Judge Barberâ€™s written order.Â  Thus, we choose to address this argument.Â  See Iâ€™on, L.L.C. v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000) (â€œThe appellate court may review respondentâ€™s additional reasons and, if convinced it is proper and fair to do so, rely on them or any other reason appearing in the record to affirm the lower courtâ€™s judgment.â€); Rule 220(c), SCACR (â€œThe appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.â€).\r\nActions to recover for personal injuries that arise after April 5, 1988, must be commenced within three years.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(5) (2005).Â  Here, the automobile accident for which Suber alleges she sustained injuries occurred on October 1, 1997.Â  Suber, however, did not file the second lawsuit until August 1, 2002, which was almost five years after the accident.Â  We hold Suberâ€™s second lawsuit was untimely and, thus, barred by the three-year statute of limitations.\r\nAccordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s order dismissing this case is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Rule 41(b) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides in pertinent part:Â  â€œFor failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these rules or any order of court, a defendant may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim against him.â€\r\n[3]Â  In this order, Judge Cooper dismissed with prejudice Suberâ€™s action against State Farm Insurance Company, Dealva Taundolyn Suberâ€™s insurer.Â  State Farm is not a party to this appeal.\r\n[4]Â Â  Although Suber raises three separate issues, all of her arguments challenge Judge Barberâ€™s dismissal of the instant action.Â  Therefore, in the interest of clarity and brevity, we have consolidated the arguments under one heading.\r\n[5]Â  We note Suber has not appealed Judge Barberâ€™s finding that the two actions involved the same parties and sought the same relief.Â  Therefore, it is the law of the case.Â  See ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 327 S.C. 238, 241, 489 S.E.2d 470, 472 (1997) (stating an unappealed ruling becomes the law of the case and precludes further consideration of the issue on appeal).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-175","title":"State v.

Williams, Sr., of Lexington, for Appellant.Â  \r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Terry R. Dawkins d/b/a Dawkins Surety Company appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order for partial estreatment of an appearance bond entered into on behalf of Robbie McFalls.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nA Spartanburg County grand jury indicted McFalls for armed robbery, receiving stolen goods, and possession with intent to distribute drugs.Â  Dawkins agreed to act as a surety for McFalls in the amount of $50,000.Â  Other parties agreed to act as surety for McFalls in additional amounts totaling $250,000.Â  \r\nThe Dawkins bond was executed on January 20, 2003.Â  McFalls was required to appear in court on April 28, 2003, but did not do so.Â  A bench warrant was issued on April 29, 2003.Â  McFalls was apprehended in Florida on July 7, 2003.Â  \r\nSeveral weeks after McFalls was captured and months after his failure to appear in court, Dawkins filed and served a motion to vacate the $50,000 bond.Â  The motion was filed on July 25, 2003.Â  A circuit court judge entered an order on August 1, 2003, granting Dawkinsâ€™ motion to vacate the bond.Â  \r\nOn August 15, 2003, a separate circuit court judge issued an order and rule to show cause to the bonding companies as to why the bond should not be estreated.Â  At a hearing on September 12, 2003, the circuit court orally ruled that $12,000 of Dawkinsâ€™ $50,000 bond should be estreated.Â  The court issued a written order on October 10, 2003.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nDawkins contends the trial court abused its discretion by ordering partial estreatment after the bond had been vacated by the earlier order.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe primary purpose of requiring a criminal defendant to post bond is to insure his appearance at trial.Â  Ex Parte Polk, 354 S.C. 8, 11, 579 S.E.2d 329, 330 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The surety, as guarantor of a bond, undertakes to assure such appearance at the risk of forfeiting the bond amount.Â  As such, the bond is a contract with the surety guaranteeing the appearance of the criminal defendant, with any penalties for breach of that contract amounting to some monetary value up to the bond amount.Â  State v. Boatwright, 310 S.C. 281, 283, 423 S.E.2d 139, 140 (1992).Â  \r\nWhether a bond should be remitted in cases where the defendant fails to appear is vested in the trial courtâ€™s discretion.Â  Id. at 283, 423 S.E.2d at 141; Ex Parte Polk, 354 S.C. at 11, 579 S.E.2d at 330.Â  The trial courtâ€™s order will be overturned only upon a finding of abuse of discretion.Â  State v. White, 284 S.C. 69, 325 S.E.2d 64 (1985).\r\nDawkins argues the circuit court was without authority to estreat a portion of the $50,000 bond because he had been released as a guarantor of McFallsâ€™ appearance by an order entered on August 1, 2003.Â  Such an argument fundamentally misunderstands the nature of the bond and liability for its contractual breach.\r\nWe first note there is a question whether Dawkins preserved this issue for appeal.Â  Dawkins presents this argument for the first time on appeal.Â  While Dawkins mentioned the order at the hearing, at no time during that hearing or in any subsequent motion to reconsider did he set forth the argument the court lacked the authority to estreat the bond because it had previously been vacated.Â  State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 121-22, 481 S.E.2d 118, 123 (1997) (a contemporaneous and specific objection is required to preserve an issue for appeal).Â  \r\nAssuming Dawkins did preserve the issue for appeal, we are not persuaded by his argument, because by the time the bond was vacated, liability on it had already attached.\r\nA bond is a contract guaranteeing the appearance of the defendant.Â  The failure to comply with the bond and appear for court creates a breach of that contract.Â  â€œUnder South Carolina law, when the terms of the bond are breached, the bond is estreated[.]â€Â  Boatwright, 310 S.C. at 286, 423 S.E.2d at 142 (Toal, J., dissenting).Â  Thus, the moment McFalls failed to appear when required, Dawkins was in breach of the bond contract and answerable for any penalty to be determined by the court.Â  \r\nDawkinsâ€™ argument is without merit because the breach occurred several months before the bond was vacated.Â  Since Dawkinsâ€™ liability to the State accrued at the point McFalls failed to appear for court, the bond may be estreated.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-178","title":"State v.

Kinard Johnson, Jr., Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-186\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2005 â€“ Filed March 11, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nDavid D. Armstrong, of Greenville, for Appellants. \r\nJill Bailey Boone and Paul Boone, Pro Se, Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This appeal arises from a dispute between Jerry and Tyra Bailey and Jill and Paul Boone over the custody of children born during the marriage of Jerry Bailey and Jill Boone.Â  The Baileys appeal the family courtâ€™s decision to leave custody with the Boones.Â  We affirm as modified.[1] Â \r\nFACTS\r\nJerry Bailey and Jill Boone, whose marriage was terminated by a divorce order entered on March 5, 1998, have three minor children.Â  Pursuant to the divorce decree, Jill maintained custody of the children while Jerry received visitation rights.Â  \r\nThe Boones filed an action in family court seeking to place further restrictions on the Baileysâ€™ visitation rights.Â  The Baileys counterclaimed, seeking to revoke the Boonesâ€™ custodial rights, claiming they created a detrimental educational environment in the way they chose to home school the children.Â  \r\nTo support their claim, the Baileys contacted a licensed clinical psychologist who opined the Boones were not providing adequate educational or social opportunities for the children.Â  Further, the psychologist stated Jill had transferred her negative feelings about Jerry to the children, who were now exhibiting negative thoughts about him.Â  \r\nOn cross-examination, the psychologist admitted the majority of her information about the Boones came from Jerry and the Guardian ad Litem, not from direct interaction with Jill.Â  She also admitted to a lack of personal knowledge about the home schooling organization the Boones belonged to.Â  Further, she admitted to concerns about the Baileys as well as the Boones.Â  \r\nThe Guardianâ€™s report noted that each parent cared deeply for the children and wanted the best for them.Â  The Guardianâ€™s first recommendation was to leave the children in the custody of the Boones due to the upheaval a change in custody would cause.Â  However, a second report indicated any trauma over a change was outweighed by the benefits the children would receive by way of educational and social opportunities with the Baileys.Â  \r\nJill testified she home-schooled her children and met all guidelines for home schooling as required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-65-47 (Supp. 2003).Â  She admitted the children showed some learning difficulties with certain subjects, but asserted they were close to their appropriate grade level.Â  Additional testimony indicated the children engaged in social and educational opportunities with other children through home school co-ops wherein parents brought their children together to be around other home-schooled children.Â  The children were also found to be active in youth sports programs and participants with their family in church activities.Â  \r\nThe family court declined to change the custodial arrangement.Â  It did, however, order the Boones to select a different, more stringent standard for home schooling the children.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn appellate court may find facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence in a case originating in family court.Â  Roberson v. Roberson, 359 S.C. 384, 388, 597 S.E.2d 840, 842 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not relieve an appellant from the burden of convincing this court that the lower court erred.Â  Brown v. Brown, 362 S.C. 85, 89-90, 606 S.E.2d 785, 787 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Further, such a broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings, especially in light of the knowledge that a trial judge is in a better position to evaluate the credibility of a witness through personal observation.Â  Roberson, 359 S.C. at 388, 597 S.E.2d at 842.Â  The inability of an appellate court to perform such observations necessitates we give great deference to the family courtâ€™s findings in cases involving the welfare and best interests of children.Â  See Brown, 362 S.C. at 89, 606 S.E.2d at 787.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Custody\r\nThe Baileysâ€™ principal contention is the family court failed to properly consider the testimony of the witnesses and thus erred in denying their motion for a change of custody.Â  We are not persuaded by this argument.\r\nThe paramount and controlling factor in every custody dispute is the best interests of the children.Â  Brown, 362 S.C. at 90, 606 S.E.2d at 788.Â  Custody decisions are normally matters left to the discretion of the trial court.Â  Id.\r\nIn situations where a change in custody is sought, the non-custodial parent bears the burden of showing changed circumstances occurring subsequent to the entry of the custody order.Â  Henggeler v. Hanson, 333 S.C. 598, 602, 510 S.E.2d 722, 725 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  â€œA change in circumstances justifying a change in the custody of a child simply means that sufficient facts have been shown to warrant the conclusion that the best interests of the child will be served by the change.â€Â  Skinner v. King, 272 S.C. 520, 523, 252 S.E.2d 891, 892-93 (1979).\r\nThe primary reason for the request for the change of custody was the perceived educational and social shortcomings resulting from the Boonesâ€™ home schooling of the children.Â  Both the Guardian and the psychologist testified to their belief the children would be presented with more social and cultural events with the Baileys.Â  However, both noted much of the information they received was through communications with Jerry.Â  \r\nJill testified to the cultural, social, and education opportunities her children were exposed to.Â  She also testified regarding their educational abilities and achievements.Â  \r\nThe family courtâ€™s order demonstrates a carefully considered opinion based on the testimony.Â  Although neither parent is perfect, the evidence indicates that neither is grossly insufficient.Â  Jill was thought by the psychologist to have failed to foster her childrenâ€™s relationship with their father.Â  Yet, the psychologist noted Jerry had disciplinary issues with the children.Â  In sum, each sought to provide what they felt best for their children, although each often failed to overcome the acrimony between themselves that is often present in such situations.Â  \r\nThe Guardianâ€™s reports were full of such tensions, with the first report recommending the present custody situation remain the same, while a subsequent report suggested it change.Â  From such evidence, the court could have concluded not enough evidence was presented by Jerry to order the change of custody.Â  As the family court noted, both parties have had changes in circumstances; however, the court is not convinced the changes warrant a change of custody. \r\nWhile the Baileys presented evidence regarding problems with the welfare of the children and the perceived need to alter the custody arrangement, there was also evidence indicating the children were doing well with the Boones and had problems when at the Baileysâ€™ household.Â  Based on our own view of the evidence, we cannot say the family court erred in concluding there are insufficient changes of circumstances to warrant a change of custody.\r\nII.Â  Home School Choice\r\nTo combat possible perceived shortcomings in the childrenâ€™s home school environment, the family court required Jill to select either Option 1 or Option 2 of Section 59-65-47 of the South Carolina Code.Â  The Baileys argue this provision of the order is â€œambiguous and/or unclear,â€ because there is only one option provided in this specific section and we must therefore reverse.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe intent of the family court is readily discernible.Â  We may therefore modify what we determine to be a scrivenerâ€™s error.Â  \r\nHome schooling is governed by sections 59-65-40, -45, and -47 of the South Carolina Code.Â  The three sections contain Options 1, 2, and 3, respectively, of the various disciplines allowed for home schooling.Â  Option 1 requires mandatory annual testing.Â  Option 2 requires instruction be conducted under the auspices of the South Carolina Association of Independent Home Schools, and Option 3 only requires the parent to be a member of an approved home school association with no fewer than fifty members.Â  Option 1 is considered the most stringent of the three, and Option 3 to be the least stringent.Â  \r\nAt the time of the hearing, Jill home-schooled the children under Option 3.Â  If the family court wished her to continue to home-school the children under section 59-65-47, there would be no need to give her the choice of selecting Option 1 or Option 2.Â  This fact, coupled with evidence before the family court that the children were not performing at adequate academic levels, evidences the family courtâ€™s clear intent to require more stringent oversight of the childrenâ€™s education to assure they have greater academic progress.Â  Option 1 and Option 2 in the order clearly reflect the family courtâ€™s desire, a desire with which we agree in light of the record, for Jill to select from the home schooling options in either sections 59-65-40 and -45, not -47 as the order indicates.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIt is evident from the record and order that the family court considered all evidence in denying the motion to change custody.Â  The court did not abuse its discretion in retaining the existing custody arrangement.Â  Further, the courtâ€™s clear intention was to provide for greater oversight of the childrenâ€™s academic well-being by mandating Jill choose between the home schooling options under 59-65-40 or -45. \r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.Â  \r\nANDERSON, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-187","title":"State v.

Dudek, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J.

Robbins, of Summerville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Troy Alexander Zeigler appeals from his conviction for murder.Â  He argues the trial court erred in (1) denying his motion for a directed verdict; (2) giving an inadequate jury charge on mere presence; and (3) failing to take sworn juror testimony and denying Troyâ€™s motion for a new trial based on allegations of juror misconduct.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nGregory McDonald, also know as Boobie, was murdered on January 19, 2001, near a trailer on Land Fill Road in Orangeburg County.Â  On the night of the murder, McDonald traveled to the trailer with Larry Zeigler, George Zeigler, and Barry Collier.Â  Troy Zeigler, his cousin Antwan Zeigler, James Hallman, Germaine Eric Hallman, and Kenneth Kirk Thomas were already inside the trailer when McDonald arrived.\r\nAccording to Collier, when he entered the trailer, Antwan looked at him as if Collier had â€œdone something bad.â€Â  Because Antwan and Troy were whispering to each other and staring at him, Collier began to feel uncomfortable and decided to exit the trailer.Â  Antwan and Troy attempted to prevent Collier from leaving.Â  Antwan and Troy followed Collier outside.Â  Collier stated he â€œfelt unsafe.â€Â  At that point, Antwan and Troy threw â€œone or twoâ€ beer bottles at Collier.Â  Collier jumped in his vehicle and drove away.\r\nKenneth Kirk Thomas testified Antwan entered the trailer and â€œtold Boobie he was the police,â€ meaning McDonald was working for the police as a confidential informant.Â  Troy, Antwan, and the Hallmans surrounded McDonald.Â  George Zeigler, Troy and Antwanâ€™s cousin, declared Antwan â€œtold [McDonald] he had to leaveâ€ and that Antwan and McDonald â€œgot into an argument.â€Â  Thomas observed Antwan throw a beer bottle at McDonald.Â  Larry Zeigler, Troyâ€™s brother and Antwanâ€™s cousin, saw Troy and Eric Hallman hit McDonald.Â  George testified he â€œthought that [Antwan] . . . thr[e]w a punch.â€Â  When McDonald attempted to leave, Troy and the Hallmans threw bottles at him.Â  McDonald ran out of the trailer onto Land Fill Road.Â  Troy, Antwan, and the Hallmans followed McDonald.\r\nApproximately ten to fifteen minutes later, Antwan, Troy and the Hallmans had not returned.Â  Thomas, Larry Zeigler, and George Zeigler decided to leave.Â  As the men were leaving the trailer, Thomas saw Antwan and Troy walking back up the dirt road toward the trailer from about twenty feet away.Â  When Thomas, Larry Zeigler, and George Zeigler reached â€œthe end of the road,â€ they noticed McDonaldâ€™s body lying facedown on the side of the road.Â  McDonald was not moving.Â  George asked Thomas to stop the car so they could help McDonald.Â  Thomas refused to help and instructed George: â€œDonâ€™t get yourself in nothing.â€\r\nThomas, Larry Zeigler, and George Zeigler drove to the Zeiglersâ€™ grandmotherâ€™s house.Â  Antwan and Troy arrived at the home after the others.Â  Thomas testified Troy said: â€œI kicked that nigger to death.â€Â  Antwan responded: â€œHe deserved it.â€Â  Thomas noted Troy was walking with a limp and that he thought Troyâ€™s toe was swollen.\r\nThe police, acting on a tip, located McDonaldâ€™s body in a ditch near the trailer on Land Fill Road.Â  Dr. Janice Ross, a forensic pathologist, performed the autopsy on McDonald.Â  McDonald had suffered injuries to his eyeballs and both sides of his head, had bruising under the scalp, and bleeding around the brain.Â  Dr. Ross opined McDonald died from â€œbleeding around the brain . . . due to a beating.â€Â  McDonald died â€œwithin minutesâ€ from this severe beating.Â  Dr. Ross testified the type of injuries sustained by McDonald allowed her to discount an assertion that the injuries were caused by McDonald falling down or being struck by a car.Â  Dr. Ross concluded McDonaldâ€™s injuries were a result of â€œblows delivered by someone else.â€ Â She stated the injuries were consistent with â€œwhat [sheâ€™s] seen caused by fists.â€Â  The Solicitor asked Dr. Ross: â€œWould [McDonaldâ€™s injuries] also have been consistent with him being kicked?â€Â  Dr. Ross answered: â€œIt could.â€\r\nAntwan and Troy were indicted for the murder of McDonald.Â  The case proceeded to trial.Â  At the close of the Stateâ€™s evidence, counsel for Antwan moved for a directed verdict, claiming there was â€œabsolutely no evidence to connect either of these defendants with the murder of Mr. McDonald.â€Â  Troyâ€™s attorney adopted Antwanâ€™s lawyerâ€™s argument.Â  The State argued the evidence showed â€œAntwan Zeigler started an altercation in the trailer, hit the deceased, threw a bottle at him, and chased him out of the trailer,â€ along with Troy Zeigler.Â  The trial court denied the motion, finding â€œthe fact that they left right after the victim did, came back without him, very shortly thereafter the body was seen, and weâ€™ve got . . . statements that . . . one of them kicked him and the other one said he deserved it, would be strong enough circumstantial evidence to make it a jury case.â€\r\nThe jury found both Troy and Antwan guilty of murder.Â  They were each sentenced to forty-five years.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err in denying Troyâ€™s motion for a directed verdict?\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court give a proper and correct instruction on mere presence?\r\nIII.Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err in refusing to take sworn juror testimony and denying Troyâ€™s motion for a new trial based on allegations of juror misconduct?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  DIRECTED VERDICT\r\nTroy contends the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict because â€œthere was not any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence that [Troy] killed [McDonald].â€Â  Troy maintains his mere presence at the scene was insufficient to prove his guilt in the murder.Â  He asserts the â€œevidence against [him] only raised a suspicion of his guilt, and he was convicted based on that suspicion.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nA.Â  Standard of Review\r\nOn appeal from the denial of a directed verdict in a criminal case, an appellate court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Curtis, 356 S.C. 622, 591 S.E.2d 600 (2004); State v. Crawford, Op. No. 3933 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Jan. 31, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 6 at 68); State v. Al-Amin, 353 S.C. 405, 578 S.E.2d 32 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  When ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.Â  Sellers v. State, 362 S.C. 182, 607 S.E.2d 82 (2005); State v. Cherry, 361 S.C. 588, 606 S.E.2d 475 (2004); State v. Wilds, 355 S.C. 269, 584 S.E.2d 138 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nIf there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, an appellate court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  Cherry, 361 S.C. at 593-94, 606 S.E.2d at 478; State v. Harris, 351 S.C. 643, 572 S.E.2d 267 (2002); State v. Follin, 352 S.C. 235, 573 S.E.2d 812 (Ct. App. 2002); see also State v. Horton, 359 S.C. 555, 598 S.E.2d 279 (Ct. App. 2004) (noting judge should deny motion for directed verdict if there is any direct or substantial circumstantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove accusedâ€™s guilt, or from which his guilt may be fairly and logically deduced).Â  When a motion for a directed verdict is made in a criminal case in which the State relies exclusively on circumstantial evidence, the trial judge is required to submit the case to the jury if there is any substantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused, or from which his guilt may be fairly and logically deduced.Â  State v. Walker, 349 S.C. 49, 562 S.E.2d 313 (2002); State v. Buckmon, 347 S.C. 316, 555 S.E.2d 402 (2001); Al-Amin, 353 S.C. at 411, 578 S.E.2d at 35; see also State v. Martin, 340 S.C. 597, 533 S.E.2d 572 (2000) (stating trial court has duty to submit case to jury where evidence is circumstantial, if there is substantial circumstantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove guilt of accused or from which his guilt may be fairly and logically deduced).Â  On the other hand, a defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.Â  Cherry, 361 S.C. at 593, 606 S.E.2d at 478; Horton, 359 S.C. at 563, 598 S.E.2d at 284; State v. Padgett, 354 S.C. 268, 580 S.E.2d 159 (Ct. App. 2003). \r\nThe trial judge should grant a directed verdict when the evidence merely raises a suspicion that the accused is guilty.Â  State v. Arnold, 361 S.C. 386, 605 S.E.2d 529 (2004); State v. Schrock, 283 S.C. 129, 322 S.E.2d 450 (1984).Â  â€œSuspicionâ€ implies a belief or opinion as to guilt based upon facts or circumstances which do not amount to proof.Â  Cherry, 361 S.C. at 594, 606 S.E.2d at 478; State v. Lollis, 343 S.C. 580, 541 S.E.2d 254 (2001).Â  However, a trial judge is not required to find that the evidence infers guilt to the exclusion of any other reasonable hypothesis.Â  Cherry, 361 S.C. at 594, 606 S.E.2d at 478; State v. Ballenger, 322 S.C. 196, 470 S.E.2d 851 (1996).\r\nThe appellate court may reverse the trial judgeâ€™s denial of a motion for a directed verdict only if there is no evidence to support the judgeâ€™s ruling.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 564 S.E.2d 87 (2002).\r\nB.Â  Definitional Analysis of Murder\r\nSouth Carolina law defines murder as â€œthe killing of any person with malice aforethought, either express or implied.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-10 (2003); Sellers v. State, 362 S.C. 182, 607 S.E.2d 82 (2005).Â  Malice is the wrongful intent to injure another and indicates a wicked or depraved spirit intent on doing wrong.Â  State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998).\r\nAny person who is present at a homicide, aiding and abetting, is guilty of the homicide as a principal, even though another does the killing.Â  State v. Crowe, 258 S.C. 258, 188 S.E.2d 379 (1972); State v. Griggs, 184 S.C. 304, 192 S.E. 360 (1937).Â  Mere presence at the scene of a crime is insufficient to convict one as a principal on the theory of aiding and abetting.Â  State v. Johnson, 291 S.C. 127, 352 S.E.2d 480 (1987); State v. Condrey, 349 S.C. 184, 562 S.E.2d 320 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nTroy relies on State v. Martin, 340 S.C. 597, 533 S.E.2d 572 (2000), arguing â€œ[t]here is less evidence against the two appellants in this case than there was against the defendantâ€ in Martin.Â  This reliance is misplaced as Martin is distinguishable from the case at bar.\r\nIn Martin, the supreme court found the trial court erred in failing to grant the defendantâ€™s motion for directed verdict because there was a total lack of evidence, either direct or circumstantial, linking the defendants to the murder.Â  In that case, the State was unable to establish a time of death of the victim, lacked any witnesses identifying the defendants at the scene of the crime at the time of the murder, and had no evidence of the defendants being in the victimâ€™s apartment any time after the victim was last seen.Â  The Martin court inculcated:\r\n\r\nIn this case, the State failed to meet the â€œany substantial evidenceâ€ standard.Â  Most significantly, the Stateâ€™s evidence failed to place either defendant inside the apartment.Â  The Solicitor himself summed up the Stateâ€™s failure of proof by confessing to the trial judge â€œwe donâ€™t know which person actually held [Victimâ€™s] head in that pan of waterâ€ and â€œYour Honor, the whole point is we donâ€™t know if they acted in concert.â€Â  Put another way, unlike the usual accomplice liability case or aiding and abetting situation, here the State had no proof that either defendant held Victimâ€™s head under water and the State had no proof that the defendants were working together to bring about the Victimâ€™s death.\r\nTaken in a light most favorable to its position, the State has shown that a car resembling the one in possession of the Defendant was parked at the Victimâ€™s apartment complex the night the murder was committed.Â  There is no evidence (such as a license tag number) that the black car was actuallyÂ  [defendantâ€™s girlfriendâ€™s] black mustang.Â  The State also presented no evidence that both defendants arrived at the apartment complex in that car or that either defendant entered Victimâ€™s apartment.Â  Furthermore, there is no evidence establishing the death occurred during the time the black car was in front of the building.\r\nThis case is similar to State v. Schrock, 283 S.C. 129, 322 S.E.2d 450 (1984), in which this Court reversed the denial of a directed verdict in a murder conviction.Â  In Schrock, the State presented evidence the defendant was in the area of the murders and that footprints at the scene of the crime were similar to footprints found in the area in which Schrock admitted he had been walking.Â  In this case, the black car seen at the apartment is not identified as [the defendantâ€™s girlfriendâ€™s] car.Â  Like the footprints in Schrock, the possibility that it was the same car, without any other evidence placing the defendants at the scene, is not enough evidence to place Defendant inside Victimâ€™s apartment.\r\n\r\nMartin, 340 S.C. at 602-03, 533 S.E.2d at 574-75.Â  In contrariety to the present case, there was virtually no evidence linking the defendants in Martin to the drowning death of the victim.\r\nC.Â  Evidentiary Record\r\nIn the instant case, the record provides substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove Troyâ€™s guilt.Â  Viewed in the light most favorable to the State, there was substantial circumstantial evidence to submit the murder charge to the jury.Â  Antwan accused McDonald of working for the police and told him he had to leave the trailer.Â  Antwan and McDonald then â€œgot into an argument.â€Â  Thomas saw Antwan throw a beer bottle at McDonald.Â  Larry Zeigler observed Troy and Eric Hallman hit McDonald.Â  George Zeigler stated he â€œthought that [Antwan] . . . thr[e]w a punch.â€Â  When McDonald attempted to leave, Troy and the Hallmans threw bottles at him.Â  McDonald ran out of the trailer onto Land Fill Road.Â  Troy, Antwan, and the Hallmans pursued McDonald.Â  Approximately ten to fifteen minutes later, when Thomas, Larry Zeigler, and George Zeigler decided to leave the trailer, Antwan, Troy and the Hallmans had not returned.Â  As the three men left the trailer, Thomas noticed Antwan and Troy walking back up the dirt road toward the trailer from about twenty feet away.Â  At â€œthe end of the road,â€ Thomas, Larry Zeigler, and George Zeigler observed McDonaldâ€™s body lying motionless facedown on the side of the road.Â  Importantly, there was a specific window of about ten to fifteen minutes from the time (1) McDonald ran out of the trailer; (2) he was chased by Troy and Antwan; (3) he suffered a severe beating; (4) Thomas saw Antwan and Troy walking back up the dirt road toward the trailer; and (5) McDonald was seen lying motionless on the side of the road.Â  The pathologist confirmed McDonald died â€œwithin minutesâ€ from bleeding around the brain due to a beating.Â  Later that night, at the Zeiglersâ€™ grandmotherâ€™s house, Troy informed Thomas: â€œI kicked that nigger to death.â€Â  Antwan then stated: â€œHe deserved it.â€Â  Thomas noted Troy was limping and that he thought Troy had a swollen toe.\r\nThe trial judge did not err in denying Troyâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on the charge of murder.\r\nII.Â  JURY CHARGE\r\nTroy asserts the trial court â€œerred by refusing to give a proper mere presence charge.â€Â  We disagree.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nGenerally, the trial judge is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina.Â  Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 594 S.E.2d 462 (2004); State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 565 S.E.2d 298 (2002); see also State v. Buckner, 341 S.C. 241, 534 S.E.2d 15 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding jury charge is proper if, as a whole, it is free from error and reflects current and correct law of South Carolina).Â  In reviewing jury charges for error, we must consider the courtâ€™s jury charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.Â  State v. Adkins, 353 S.C. 312, 577 S.E.2d 460 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  If, as a whole, the charges are reasonably free from error, isolated portions which might be misleading do not constitute reversible error.Â  State v. Sims, 304 S.C. 409, 405 S.E.2d 377 (1991); State v. Jackson, 297 S.C. 523, 377 S.E.2d 570 (1989).\r\nA jury charge is correct if, when the charge is read as a whole, it contains the correct definition and adequately covers the law.Â  In re McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 551 S.E.2d 235 (2001); State v. Johnson, 315 S.C. 485, 445 S.E.2d 637 (1994); see also State v. Burton, 302 S.C. 494, 397 S.E.2d 90 (1990) (charge is sufficient if, when considered as a whole, it covers law applicable to case).Â  The substance of the law is what must be charged to the jury, not any particular verbiage.Â  Burkhart, 350 S.C. at 261, 565 S.E.2d at 303; State v. Smith, 315 S.C. 547, 446 S.E.2d 411 (1994); Adkins, 353 S.C. at 318-19, 577 S.E.2d at 464.\r\nA jury charge which is substantially correct and covers the law does not require reversal.Â  State v. Foust, 325 S.C. 12, 479 S.E.2d 50 (1996); State v. Hoffman, 312 S.C. 386, 440 S.E.2d 869 (1994).Â  To warrant reversal, a trial judgeâ€™s refusal to give a requested jury charge must be both erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant.Â  State v. Hughey, 339 S.C. 439, 529 S.E.2d 721 (2000); Adkins, 353 S.C. at 319, 577 S.E.2d at 464.\r\nAs an initial matter, Troyâ€™s argument regarding the sufficiency of the mere presence charge may not be preserved for appellate review.Â  Troyâ€™s counsel did not specifically join in Antwanâ€™s objection to the jury charge.Â  An issue is not preserved for review where the appellant failed to object at trial or join in his co-defendantâ€™s objection.Â  See State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 481 S.E.2d 118 (1997); State v. Carriker, 269 S.C. 553, 238 S.E.2d 678 (1977).\r\nEven if the issue was preserved at trial, the mere presence charge was sufficient.Â  To be guilty as an aider or abettor, the participant must have knowledge of the principalâ€™s criminal conduct.Â  State v. Leonard, 292 S.C. 133, 355 S.E.2d 270 (1987).Â  Mere presence at the scene is not sufficient to establish guilt as an aider or abettor.Â  Id. at 137, 355 S.E.2d at 272; State v. Johnson, 291 S.C. 127, 352 S.E.2d 480 (1987); State v. Green, 261 S.C. 366, 200 S.E.2d 74 (1973).\r\nThe trial court gave the following jury instruction in regard to mere presence:\r\n\r\nThe mere knowledge that another person is going to commit a crime, even if the defendant is present when the crime is committed is not sufficient to convict the defendant as a principal.Â  Guilt is shown by active or constructive presence at the scene, and the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt by competent evidence the theory of the hand of one is the hand of all.Â  A principal in a crime is one who either actually commits the crime or who is present, aiding, abetting or assisting in the commission of the crime.Â  When a person does an act in the presence of and with the assistance of another, the act is done by both.Â  Where two or more acting with a common plan or intent [are] present at the commission of a crime, it does not matter who actually commits the crime, all are guilty.Â  The hand of one is the hand of all.Â  Present means to be sufficiently near to aid and abet and assist in the commission of the crime.Â  Intent is also a necessary element, for there must have been a common design or intent to commit the crime, and the crime must have been committed pursuant to that plan, with the person aiding and abetting by some overt act. \r\n\r\nThe charge in the case sub judice adequately apprises the jury as to the law regarding mere presence.Â  The charge contains the correct definition for mere presence and adequately covers the law.\r\nAdditionally, Troy claims the charge was not sufficient because it did not track the jury instruction given in State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998).Â  We find this argument to be without merit.Â  The substance of the law is what must be charged to the jury, not any particular verbiage.Â  See Burkhart, 350 S.C. at 261, 565 S.E.2d at 303.Â  Because the trial judge adequately charged the jury as to the law of mere presence, we need not look to the particular verbiage used in giving the instruction.\r\nIII.Â  JUROR MISCONDUCT\r\nTroy alleges the trial court erred in finding he failed to present any evidence regarding juror misconduct that would warrant sworn juror testimony or a new trial.Â  We disagree.\r\nOn appeal, the denial of a new trial motion will be disturbed only upon a showing of an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Kelly, 331 S.C. 132, 502 S.E.2d 99 (1998); State v. Smith, 316 S.C. 53, 447 S.E.2d 175 (1993).Â  A denial of a new trial based on alleged jury misconduct is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Covington, 343 S.C. 157, 539 S.E.2d 67 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The trial court has broad discretion in assessing allegations of juror misconduct.Â  Kelly, 331 S.C. at 141, 502 S.E.2d at 104.Â  Unless the misconduct affects the juryâ€™s impartiality, it is not such misconduct as will affect the verdict.Â  State v. Grovenstein, 335 S.C. 347, 517 S.E.2d 216 (1999); Kelly, 331 S.C. at 141, 502 S.E.2d at 104.\r\nThe general test for evaluating alleged juror misconduct is whether there in fact was misconduct and, if so, whether any harm resulted to the defendant as a consequence.Â  State v. Smith, 338 S.C. 66, 525 S.E.2d 263 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Where a defendant seeks a new trial on the basis of juror misconduct, he is required to prove both the alleged misconduct and the resulting prejudice.Â  State v. Galbreath, 359 S.C. 398, 597 S.E.2d 845 (Ct. App. 2004); see also State v. Aldret, 333 S.C. 307, 509 S.E.2d 811 (1999) (a defendant must demonstrate prejudice from jury misconduct in order to be entitled to a new trial).Â  Misconduct of a juror is a fact to be determined by the trial judge from the circumstances of each case.Â  Smith, 338 S.C. at 71, 525 S.E.2d at 266.\r\nIn a criminal prosecution, the conduct of the jurors should be free from all extraneous or improper influences.Â  Kelly, 331 S.C. at 141, 502 S.E.2d at 104; see also State v. Salters, 273 S.C. 501, 257 S.E.2d 502 (1979) (finding a defendant in a criminal prosecution is constitutionally guaranteed a fair trial by an impartial jury and, in order to fully safeguard this basic protection, it is required that the jury render its verdict free from outside influences).\r\nInitially, the trial judge must make a factual determination as to whether juror misconduct has occurred.Â  See Smith, 338 S.C. at 71, 525 S.E.2d at 266; see also Aldret, 333 S.C. at 315, 509 S.E.2d at 815 (holding where affidavits supporting juror misconduct are credible, the trial court must conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine if misconduct occurred).Â  â€œOnly if the trial court finds a juror is guilty of misconduct must the judge determine whether the misconduct affected the verdict, warranting a new trial.â€Â  Covington, 343 S.C. at 164, 539 S.E.2d at 70.\r\nAs a general rule, juror testimony is inadmissible to impeach a jury verdict.Â  State v. Hunter, 320 S.C. 85, 463 S.E.2d 314 (1995).Â  Normally, courts should not intrude into the privacy of the jury room to scrutinize how jurors reached their verdict.Â  Id.Â  Traditionally, a jurorâ€™s testimony was not admissible to prove either his own misconduct or the misconduct of other jurors.Â  Galbreath, 359 S.C. at 405, 597 S.E.2d at 848.Â  However, Rule 606(b), SCRE, altered this common law rule, and now, juror testimony regarding external prejudicial information or improper outside influence is allowed.Â  Rule 606(b) provides:\r\n\r\nUpon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the juryâ€™s deliberations or to the effect of anything upon that or any other jurorâ€™s mind or emotions as influencing the juror to assent to or dissent from the verdict or indictment or concerning the jurorâ€™s mental processes in connection therewith, except that a juror may testify on the question whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the juryâ€™s attention or whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror.Â  Nor may a jurorâ€™s affidavit or evidence of any statement by the juror concerning a matter about which the juror would be precluded from testifying be received for these purposes.\r\n\r\nThus, juror testimony or affidavits are admissible to prove an allegation of extraneous information or influence.Â  See State v. Franklin, 341 S.C. 555, 534 S.E.2d 716 (Ct. App. 2000); see also Aldret, 333 S.C. at 310, 509 S.E.2d at 812 (juror testimony or affidavits are generally admissible in the case of an extraneous influence); Hunter, 320 S.C. at 88, 463 S.E.2d at 316 (juror testimony may normally be used when an extraneous influence is alleged).Â  External influence on a jury involves situations where jurors receive information during deliberations from some outside source.Â  Galbreath, 359 S.C. at 405, 597 S.E.2d at 848.Â  The judge noted that no extraneous influence was present in the case at bar.Â  In addition, Troy concedes the misconduct alleged in this case is internal juror misconduct.\r\nIf the alleged misconduct is internal, as we have in this matter, courts are more strict.Â  Hunter, 320 S.C. at 88, 463 S.E.2d at 316.Â  Internal influences involve information coming from the jurors themselves.Â  Galbreath, 359 S.C. at 406, 597 S.E.2d at 849.Â  Until 1995, the prohibition against juror testimony regarding allegations of internal jury misconduct remained intact.Â  In State v. Hunter, our supreme court carved out an exception to this rule, holding that juror testimony is competent in cases involving internal misconduct where necessary to ensure due process, i.e., fundamental fairness.Â  Id.; see also Aldret, 333 S.C. at 312, 509 S.E.2d at 813 (finding premature jury deliberations may affect fundamental fairness of a trial such that the trial court may inquire into such allegations and may consider juror affidavits in support of such allegations); Ex Parte Greenville News, 326 S.C. 1, 482 S.E.2d 556 (1997) (stating juror testimony regarding internal misconduct is generally inadmissible to impeach a verdict except when necessary to ensure fundamental fairness); Hunter, 320 S.C. at 88, 463 S.E.2d at 316 (noting jurorâ€™s testimony was properly considered as basis for impeaching jury verdict, where juror claimed racial prejudice played role in determining defendantâ€™s guilt).Â  In State v. Franklin, the court of appeals held:\r\n\r\n[W]e emphasize that the exception to the general rule against review of internal jury deliberations carved out in Hunter is a narrow one, limited by our supreme court to those few situations which implicate due process raising a question of fundamental fairness. . . . But the integrity of the jury system is jeopardized any time a court finds it necessary to intrude into the internal deliberation process.Â  Such an inquiry should not be lightly made.\r\n\r\nFranklin, 341 S.C. at 562, 534 S.E.2d at 720.\r\nAfter a three-day trial, the judge submitted the case to the jury.Â  On the second morning of deliberations, the jury sent the trial court a note, asking: â€œIs it a possibility that the defendants go under oath and tell their side of the story?â€Â  After a brief discussion with counsel for Antwan and Troy Zeigler, the trial court instructed: â€œ[W]e cannot receive new evidence at this time.Â  Please remember that you should not consider the fact that defendants did not testify.â€Â  Counsel for Antwan and Troy concurred in the instruction.Â  The jury resumed deliberations and returned a guilty verdict as to both defendants.Â  Attorneys for Antwan and Troy moved for a new trial, arguing the jury â€œmade it clear that they were considering things that [the trial court] specifically instructed them not to consider when they sent out the note saying that they wanted testimony from the defendants.Â  Clearly, they were considering whether the defendants testified or not.â€Â  The trial court denied the motion.\r\nLawyers for both Antwan and Troy filed a joint motion to impeach the verdict, take sworn testimony of jurors, and for a new trial.Â  At the hearing, it was argued that the jurors â€œwere basing their verdict, many of them, on the fact that the Zeiglers did not testify.â€Â  The trial court considered the statements taken from the jurors by investigators hired by the Zeiglers, even though the statements were not sworn affidavits.Â  The court ruled: â€œI just donâ€™t see any evidence that this jury made its decision based on an improper consideration of the defendants failing to testify.â€\r\nInitially, we note that at the end of the trial the judge gave a detailed charge to the jury instructing them not to consider the fact that the defendants did not testify:\r\n\r\nBecause the defendant, ladies and gentlemen, in a criminal trial, is presumed to be innocent, as I told you, the law never imposes upon a defendant the burden or the duty of testifying, of calling any witnesses, or producing any evidence.Â  The defendant in a criminal trial has the absolute right under the Constitution of the United States and the State of South Carolina not to take the witness stand and testify.Â  The exercise by a defendant of this right not to testify or present any evidence must not be considered by you in any way against the defendant, and should play no role whatsoever in your discussions or your deliberations.Â  No inference of any kind may be drawn from the defendantâ€™s exercise of his constitutional right not to testify or present other evidence.\r\n\r\nThe judge reiterated this principle in a charge after receipt of the jury note.\r\nInvestigators for Antwan and Troy contacted eight jurors.Â  Seven of the jurors provided statements, not affidavits, to the investigators.Â  Three of the jurors expressed very clearly they based their decision in the case on the evidence presented at trial only.Â  Although the other four jurors who provided statements all professed they thought the defendants should have testified, none of the jurors stated that was the reason they found the defendants guilty.Â  Each of the four jurors declared their decision was based upon the evidence presented by the State at trial.Â  The statements given by the four jurors support the trial courtâ€™s finding that further investigation was not merited.\r\nTroy relies on State v. Bryant, 354 S.C. 390, 581 S.E.2d 157 (2003), for the proposition that the judge â€œshould have heard the testimony from the jurors as requested in the motion.â€Â  Bryant is distinguishable from the case sub judice.Â  Bryant involved the questioning of jurorsâ€™ family members by Horry County Police detectives before trial in a death penalty setting in a case in which the victim was a Horry County Police Department Officer. Â Thus, unlike the present case, Bryant was an extraneous influence case.\r\nHere, the trial judge considered the statements even though no sworn affidavits of the jurors were introduced at the hearings.Â  The judge noted: â€œ[W]e donâ€™t have any affidavits . . . . Iâ€™m not sure we really have any competent evidence before the court, but Iâ€™m considering what evidence we have as competent evidence, even though there are no affidavits.â€Â  The extant precedent mandates the presentation of affidavits or sworn testimony of jurors.Â  This evidentiary record is devoid of the required showing in a case involving internal juror misconduct.\r\nThe trial court did not err in refusing to take sworn juror testimony and denying Troyâ€™s motion for a new trial based on allegations of juror misconduct.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, Troy Zeiglerâ€™s conviction is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n ANDERSON, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-189","title":"State v.

David Butler, all of Barnwell, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Frankie Neal, as personal representative of the estate of Francesca Neal, appeals from a grant of summary judgment in his wrongful death and survival action against Ashleigh Place, Inc., the South Carolina Department of Mental Health (DMH), and the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) (collectively â€œRespondentsâ€).Â  We affirm.[1]\r\n FACTS\r\n    On June 27, 2002, Nealâ€™s 14-year-old daughter, Francesca Neal, stole a car and was involved in a one-car accident that resulted in her death.Â  Francesca had stolen vehicles on three occasions in the fifteen months prior to her death.Â  \r\n    The first theft occurred on April 12, 2001 when Francesca broke into a neighborâ€™s home and stole her vehicle.Â  As a result, Francesca was admitted to several institutions under the care of DMH and DJJ.Â  After her release, on June 19, 2001, Francesca was placed at the Rock Hill Girls Home until eight days later, when she stole a van from the home and ran away.Â  Francesca was again admitted to several DMH and DJJ facilities.Â  \r\n    On October 1, 2001, Francesca was placed at the Ellen Hines Smith Girls Home in Spartanburg; however, six days later, she ran away from the home.Â  Again, Francesca was placed in various DMH and DJJ facilities until she was discharged into Nealâ€™s care.Â  Francesca was assigned a mentor to help her readjust to family life; however, on May 19, 2002, she stole her mentorâ€™s car keys and took her car without her permission.Â  Francesca was charged with grand larceny auto and sentenced to 90 days in a DJJ facility.Â  \r\n    On June 5, 2002, DJJ and DMH placed Francesca at Ashleigh Place, a charitable organization that serves as an unsecured high management group home for troubled female juveniles.Â  On June 17, 2002, Francesca stole a staff memberâ€™s car keys; however, they were found in her possession before she could steal the car.Â  Francescaâ€™s DJJ probation officer was informed on June 25, 2002 that Francesca had been caught with a staff memberâ€™s keys.Â  She then contacted Francescaâ€™s DMH counselor, who called Ashleigh Place and was assured that the facility could â€œmanage [Francescaâ€™s] threats.â€Â  One of the precautions Ashleigh Place took to prevent Francesca from stealing again was to require her to wear a white outfit that had no pockets so she could be observed.Â  However, just two days later, Francesca left the residence building without permission, broke into the locked Directorâ€™s office, and removed the Directorâ€™s keys from her desk.Â  She then stole the Directorâ€™s vehicle and sped off from the facility at a high rate of speed, estimated at 70 miles per hour.Â  Staff immediately called 911 to report the stolen vehicle.Â  About a quarter of a mile away from the facility, Francesca ran off the road and flipped the vehicle.Â  Francesca was not wearing a seatbelt, was thrown from the vehicle, and was killed as a result.Â  Members of the Ashleigh Place staff drove out to meet the police when they found the overturned vehicle.Â  There were no witnesses to the accident and there was no indication that anyone did anything to prompt Francesca to drive in a dangerous manner.\r\n    On May 15, 2003, Neal brought an action against Respondents for the wrongful death of Francesca, alleging that Ashleigh Place was negligent in failing to prevent Francesca from stealing the vehicle, and DJJ and DMH were grossly negligent in placing Francesca at Ashley Place and in failing to use slight care when they were notified that Francesca had stolen a staff memberâ€™s car keys.Â  Respondents filed motions for summary judgment.Â  After a hearing on February 2, 2004, the trial judge granted Respondentsâ€™ motions, holding that â€œno jury under these facts could determine that [Francesca] did not contribute to her death in a percentage of fault and wrongdoing that exceeded 50%.â€Â  Neal now appeals.Â Â  \r\n     LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n        Neal argues the trial court erred by granting Respondentsâ€™ motions for summary judgment because issues of a partyâ€™s negligence are a question of fact for a jury in both negligence and comparative negligence scenarios.Â  We disagree.\r\n        Summary judgment is appropriate when it is clear there is no issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  Baughman v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 114-115, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545 (1991).Â  In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the evidence and the inferences that can be drawn therefrom should be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id. at 115, 410 S.E.2d 537 at 545.Â  In reviewing the grant of summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56, SCRCP.Â  Id. at 114, 410 S.E.2d 537 at 545.Â  \r\n        To establish a cause of action in negligence, Neal must prove three elements: (1) a duty of care owed by Respondents to Francesca; (2) breach of that duty by a negligent act or omission; and (3) damage proximately resulting from the breach of duty.Â  Bloom v. Ravoira, 339 S.C. 417, 422, 529 S.E.2d 710, 712 (2000).Â  \r\n        Neal argues the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to Respondents DJJ and DMH because the evidence was sufficient for a jury to find gross negligence on their part.Â  \r\n        South Carolina Code section 15-78-60(25) (2005) states that a governmental entity is only liable for a loss resulting from the â€œsupervision, protection, control, confinement, or custody of any student, patient, prisoner, inmate, or client of any governmental entityâ€ when the responsibility or duty is exercised in a grossly negligent manner.Â  Our supreme court has defined gross negligence, as applied to a governmental entity, as â€œthe intentional conscious failure to do something which it is incumbent upon one to do or the doing of a thing intentionally that one ought not to do.â€Â  Jinks v. Richland County, 355 S.C 341, 345, 585 S.E.2d 281, 283 (2003).Â  â€œIt is the failure to exercise slight care.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œGross negligence has also been defined as a relative term and means the absence of care that is necessary under the circumstances.â€Â  Id.Â  Â Â \r\n        Neal claims that DJJ and DMH were grossly negligent in placing Francesca at Ashley Place.Â  It appears that Neal postulates that DJJ and DMH should have placed Francesca in a secure facility; however, the family court order stated she was to be placed in a group home.Â  Furthermore, Ashleigh Place is a high management facility, which is the highest level of security short of confinement in a secure facility, and placing Francesca in a secure facility would have violated the family court order.Â  Neal also claims that DJJ and DMH were grossly negligent in failing to use slight care when they were alerted that Francesca had stolen a staff memberâ€™s car keys; however, when notified of the incident, Francescaâ€™s DJJ probation officer and DMH counselor contacted Ashleigh Place to confirm the facility was aware of Francescaâ€™s history of car theft and was capable of handling Francescaâ€™s threats.Â  \r\n        Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Neal, it cannot be said that DJJ and DMH intentionally failed to do what they were obligated to do, which was to place Francesca in a group home and monitor her progress.Â  Thus, the trial court did not err by granting DJJ and DMHâ€™s motions for summary judgment.\r\n        Neal also argues the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to Respondent Ashleigh Place because the evidence was sufficient for a jury to find simple negligence on its part.Â  \r\n        Neal claims that Ashleigh Place was negligent by taking insufficient precautions to keep Francesca from stealing a staff memberâ€™s keys a second time.Â  However, Ashleigh Place took several precautions to prevent Francesca from obtaining car keys: Ashleigh Place made Francesca wear a suit without pockets and stored the keys in a locked office that Francesca was not permitted to enter.Â  Thus, Ashleigh Place was not negligent in its efforts to prevent Francesca from stealing a car and the trial court did not err by granting Ashleigh Placeâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n        Furthermore, Neal argues the issue of Respondentsâ€™ negligence is a question of fact for a jury in a comparative negligence scenario.Â  â€œHowever, under South Carolinaâ€™s doctrine of comparative negligence, a plaintiff may only recover damages if his own negligence is not greater than that of the defendant.â€Â  Bloom, 339 S.C. at 422, 529 S.E.2d at 712-713.Â  While the issue of a partyâ€™s negligence is generally a question of fact for a jury, in a comparative negligence case, the trial court should â€œdetermine judgment as a matter of law if the sole reasonable inference which may be drawn from the evidence is that the plaintiffâ€™s negligence exceeded fifty percent.â€Â  Id. at 422, 529 S.E.2d at 713.Â  Thus, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, the court must determine whether a verdict for the opposing party would be reasonably possible under the facts.Â  Id. at 423, 529 S.E.2d at 713.\r\n        In this case, the trial judge found that the â€œundisputed facts in this case cause the court to determine as a matter of law that any negligence on the part of the [Respondents] was exceeded by relevant conduct of [Francesca] that was negligent and reckless, at a minimum.â€Â  The court determined that even if Ashleigh Place had a duty to keep Francesca from stealing cars (which it declined to do), the theft of the car alone did not kill her.Â  Despite Ashleigh Placeâ€™s efforts to keep Francesca from acquiring anyoneâ€™s car keys, she broke into a locked office, searched through a desk, took the keys to a car, and stole a vehicle.Â  Considering these facts, the trial court did not err by granting summary judgment to Respondents.\r\n        AFFIRMED.Â Â Â  \r\n        ANDERSON, BEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-191","title":"Woodall v.

McAlister, Jack Griffith, and Susan Cobb Singleton, all of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Dorothy Williamson appeals from the trial courtâ€™s order affirming the probate courtâ€™s decision to grant Lillie Woodall an award of $33,912 from Nadine Woodallâ€™s estate as reasonable compensation for personal caregiver services.Â  We affirm.[1] Â \r\nFACTS\r\nFollowing the death of Nadine Woodall in January 2001, Lillie Woodall, Nadineâ€™s daughter-in-law, filed a creditorâ€™s claim in the amount of $49,275 against Nadineâ€™s estate, claiming a portion of the estate as payment for personal caregiver services rendered for the nine years prior to Nadineâ€™s death.Â  Nadineâ€™s daughter, Dorothy Williamson, disputed Lillieâ€™s claim, alleging Lillie neither render services nor did Nadine require any services.Â  The probate court appointed David Woodall, son of Nadine and husband of Lillie, as personal representative of the estate.Â  However, because of the possible conflict of interest resulting from Lillieâ€™s claim, the probate court appointed Daniel Pruitt as special administrator to review Lillieâ€™s claim.Â  \r\nFollowing a hearing, the probate court ordered a partial award to Lillie, â€œgiv[ing] great weight to the evidence resulting from the investigation conducted by the Special Administrator and the medical records.â€Â  Following the probate courtâ€™s denial of Williamsonâ€™s motion for reconsideration, Williamson appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed the probate court.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWilliamson claims the probate court erred in relying on testimony by Pruitt, who was never sworn under oath.Â  We find this issue was not preserved. \r\nIt is well settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.Â  Holy Loch Distributors, Inc. v. Hitchcock, 340 S.C. 20, 24, 531 S.E.2d 282, 284 (2000).\r\nWhen Pruitt took the stand, the probate court told him, â€œIâ€™m not going to administer the oath because youâ€™re an attorney and Officer of the Court with a glowing reputation here.â€Â  At that point, to preserve the issue on appeal, Williamson should have objected to the testimony of Pruitt without his being under oath.Â  No actions were taken in this case to preserve the issue for appellate review; therefore, this issue is not preserved for appeal.Â Â  \r\nWilliamson also argues the circuit court erred in allowing the attorney for the estate to speak on behalf of the estate and the probate courtâ€™s decision to honor Lillieâ€™s claim.Â  We disagree.\r\nAmy Richmond was the attorney for the estate during the trial in the circuit court.Â  She also represented David Woodall, Lillieâ€™s husband, in his capacity as the personal representative of the estate.Â  Williamson objected to Richmondâ€™s representation of the estate because she thought Richmond was also representing Lillie.Â  The circuit court dealt with Williamsonâ€™s objection by reminding her that Richmond represented the estate, which did not belong to anyone yet, and that she was merely presenting the facts as the probate court deemed them to be.Â  We find the circuit court had sufficient evidence to overrule Williamsonâ€™s objection.Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nANDERSON, BEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-192","title":"Mathias v.

Mathias, III doing business as T &amp; M Farm, brought several claims against Rural Community Insurance Company (RCIC) and its agent Jackie Starnes, arising out of Starnesâ€™ procurement of Multiple Peril Crop Insurance for T &amp; M.Â  RCIC filed a motion to compel arbitration pursuant to an arbitration clause in the policy.Â  The trial judge denied this motion.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 2000, T &amp; M Farm purchased Multiple Peril Crop Insurance (MPCI) from RCIC through its agent Jackie Starnes.Â  The policy covered T &amp; Mâ€™s crops in Allendale and Hampton counties.Â  As part of procuring the policies, RCIC asked T &amp; M to provide a crop production history for each location.Â  RCIC used this information to determine the amount of insurance T &amp; M could purchase.Â  Although T &amp; M previously produced crops in Allendale County, it did not previously farm in Hampton County.Â  T &amp; M alleges Starnes communicated that production history from other counties could be used to establish the insured production level for Hampton County.Â  Based on Starnesâ€™ assurances, the crop production history for the crops grown in Allendale County was used to determine the crop history calculation for Hampton County.Â  RCIC issued the policies based on this information.Â  \r\nIn 2000 and 2001, T &amp; M experienced crop losses and filed claims with RCIC.Â  RCIC paid the claims, but later notified T &amp; M that the indemnifications paid were greater than the amount of insurance T &amp; M was entitled to purchase.Â  RCIC informed T &amp; M that because the policies were issued on erroneous crop production history for the Hampton County crops, it would reduce T &amp; Mâ€™s indemnity amount and T &amp; M was responsible to repay the overpayment on its claims.Â  \r\nT &amp; M brought suit alleging negligence by Starnes for which RCIC is vicariously liable, seeking an accounting as to the amount of overpayments calculated by RCIC, breach of contract and bad faith by RCIC, indemnification, breach of fiduciary duty by Starnes, and negligent misrepresentation by both Starnes and RCIC.[1]Â Â Â  \r\nRCIC filed a motion to compel arbitration and to stay the proceedings based on an arbitration clause in the policy.Â  The RCIC policy, contains the following arbitration clause: \r\n\r\nIf you and we fail to agree on any factual determination, the disagreement will be resolved in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association.Â  Failure to agree with any factual determination made by FCIC must be resolved through the FCIC appeal provisions published at 7 CFR part 11. \r\n\r\nThe trial judge denied RCICâ€™s motion.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe question of the arbitrability of a claim is an issue for judicial determination, unless the parties provide otherwise.â€Â \r\nZabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 596, 553 S.E.2d 110, 118 (2001).Â  Both South Carolina and the United States have a policy of favoring arbitration.Â  Id. (citation omitted).Â  However, arbitration is a matter of contract and parties may not be forced to arbitrate claims they have not contractually agreed to arbitrate.Â  Towles v. United HealthCare Corp., 338 S.C. 29, 37, 524 S.E.2d 839, 843-44 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  An appeal from the denial of a motion to compel arbitration is subject to de novo review.Â  Rich v. Walsh, 357 S.C. 64, 68, 590 S.E.2d 506, 508 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nRCIC initially appealed on two grounds.Â  First, RCIC maintains the trial judge erred in finding that claims brought by T &amp; M were not subject to the arbitration clause in the policy.Â  Second, RCIC argues the South Carolina Arbitration Act did not reverse preempt the Federal Arbitration Act.Â  The trial judge did not rule upon the second issue, and T &amp; M conceded no dispute existed over the application of the Federal Arbitration Act to any arbitable aspect of this cause of action.Â  Therefore, we only address the first issue.Â  \r\nRCIC contends the causes of action brought by T &amp; M are within the scope of the arbitration clause contained in the policy.Â  We disagree. \r\nâ€œTo decide whether an arbitration agreement encompasses a dispute, a court must determine whether the factual allegations underlying the claim are within the scope of the broad arbitration clause, regardless of the label assigned to the claim.â€Â  Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 597, 553 S.E.2.d at 118.Â  Any doubts concerning the scope of the arbitration clause, should be resolved in favor of arbitration.Â  Id.  \r\nRCIC argues the claims brought by T &amp; M are squarely within the scope of the arbitration clause because they involve a â€œfactual determinationâ€ as set forth in the language of the arbitration clause.Â  RCIC cites several federal district court cases finding factual determinations pursuant to the language in the policy.[2]Â  These cases, however, are distinguishable from the case at bar because each involved a specific factual discrepancy related to coverage under the policies.Â  Although RCIC argues that â€œthe claims of T &amp; M farm are based on a number of factual determinations by RCIC,â€ it fails to show any such determinations.Â  \r\nT &amp; M asserts no factual dispute exists, and we agree.Â  T &amp; M does not dispute RCICâ€™s interpretation of the language in the policy with regard to coverage.Â  T &amp; M does not disagree with the findings of RCICâ€™s audit, which uncovered the use of the incorrect production history data.Â  In addition, T &amp; M does not dispute that incorrect data was used to determine the amount of insurance T &amp; M was allowed to purchase and as a result, the indemnification received by T &amp; M needed to be adjusted.Â  The crux of T &amp; Mâ€™s action is not whether RCIC was incorrect in determining it received an indemnification greater than T &amp; M was allowed to receive, but whether RCIC is vicariously liable for the negligence of its agent.Â  This action relates not to the policy, but to the actions of RCICâ€™s agent in procuring the policy for T &amp; M and RCICâ€™s actions after it discovered the wrong information was utilized.Â  Therefore, we find the causes of action alleged by T &amp; M do not involve a â€œfactual determination.â€Â  Thus, these causes of action lie outside the scope of the arbitration clause in the policy and are not subject to arbitration.Â  The trial judgeâ€™s order denying RCICâ€™s motion to compel arbitration is therefore\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1]Â  Jackie Starnes did not appeal from the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  Therefore, the current appeal concerns only those claims T &amp; M asserts against RCIC.Â  \r\n[2] See, e.g.,Â  In re 2000 Sugar Beet Crop Ins. Litig., 228 F. Supp. 2d 992 (D. Minn. 2002) (finding denial of coverage to be a factual determination); Ledford Farms, Inc. v. Firemanâ€™s Fund Ins. Co., 184 F. Supp. 2d 1242 (S.D. Fla. 2001) (finding the issue of whether it was practical to replant a crop, as required under the policy, was a factual determination); Nobles v. Rural Cmty. Ins. Servs., 122 F. Supp. 2d 1290 (M.D. Ala. 2000) (finding the issue of whether a portion of the crop had been harvested within the time allowed under the policy to be a factual determination).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-193","title":"Robinson v.

Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996). Our broad scope of review does not relieve appellant of his burden to convince this court the family court committed error.&nbsp; Skinner v.

Washington, 308 S.C. 549, 551, 419 S.E.2d 779, 781 (1992) (where the Husband did not raise issues to the family court at trial or through a motion to amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, the issues were not properly before the appellate court for review).\r\nThe family court rejected Husbandâ€™s argument that the 1997 tax liability to the Internal Revenue Service was a marital debt subject to equitable apportionment.Â  We agree with Husband that the family court erred in this regard.\r\nâ€œMarital propertyâ€ for purposes of the South Carolina Equitable Apportionment of Marital Property Act is defined in section 20-7-473 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004) as â€œall real and personal property which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation . . . .â€Â  In making an equitable apportionment, the family court should consider â€œany other existing debts incurred by the parties or either of them during the course of the marriage.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472(13) (Supp. 2004). Debts incurred for marital purposes are subject to equitable distribution.Â  Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 103, 545 S.E.2d 531, 539 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œMarital debtâ€ has been defined as debt incurred for the joint benefit of the parties regardless of whether the parties are legally jointly liable for the debt or whether one party is legally individually liable.Â  Thomas v. Thomas, 346 S.C. 20, 27, 550 S.E.2d 580, 584 (Ct. App. 2001).Â Â  The 1997 tax liabilityâ€”incurred from Husbandâ€™s 1997 marital earningsâ€”was clearly â€œincurred . . . during the course of the marriage,â€ and the partiesâ€™ unwillingness or inability to ascertain the precise amount of this debt prior to the commencement of marital litigation is of no moment for classification purposes.Â  \r\nIn this matter, after identifying and valuing the various items of marital and non-marital propertyâ€”exclusive of the 1997 tax liabilityâ€”the family court apportioned the marital property equally between the parties.Â  The 1997 tax liability was, to be sure, â€œacquiredâ€ during the marriage within the meaning of section 20-7-473, and it is presumptively marital debt. We have reviewed the record and find, as Husband avers, the 1997 tax liability constitutes marital debt and is subject to apportionment. \r\nThe 1997 tax liability is $5,465.98.Â  We modify the equitable division award to reflect an equal apportionment of this additional marital debt.[3]Â  Each party would, therefore, be responsible for $2,732.99, rounded to $2,733.Â  We thus reduce the amount owed to Wife to effect an equal division of the marital estate to $22,905 ($25,638 minus $2,733).Â  Husband shall pay to Wife a minimum of $500 per month until the amount is paid in full.Â Â Â  \r\nII.Â  Valuation of the Marital Property\r\nHusband contends the family court erred in valuing the marital residence and the 1994 Volvo truck.Â  We disagree.\r\nHusband contends the family court erred in valuing the marital residence at $145,000.Â  We disagree.Â  Wife valued the residence at $145,000 and admitted the deed and related documents to support her valuation.Â  The Husband valued the residence at approximately $131,000.Â  The family court, which saw and heard the testimony and evidence presented by both Husband and Wife as to the value of the marital residence, valued the marital residence at $145,000.Â  We find no abuse of discretion in the family court establishing this amount as the value for equitable apportionment purposes.\r\nHusband also claims the family court erred in valuing the 1994 Volvo tractor truck.Â  We disagree.Â  Wife presented testimony, admitted without objection, valuing the 1994 Volvo tractor truck at $10,845.Â  The record reflects the husband offered no other valuation of the truck.Â  We find the family court did not abuse its discretion in accepting Wifeâ€™s valuation of the Volvo truck, especially in the absence of a contrary value from Husband.\r\nHusband alleges the family court erred in not including a â€œleaf and six chairs,â€ which are in the possession of Wife, as marital assets.Â  We disagree.Â  Nothing in the record indicates whether Husband made this request at trial, nor does he cite the record to support this claim in his brief.Â Â  Husband offered no testimony as to this specific piece of personal property at the family court hearing, and the family court order does not mention this specific item.Â  Moreover, no Rule 59 motion was filed with the family court addressing this piece of personal property.Â  Therefore, this issue is not properly before this court.Â  See Zaman v. S.C. Bd. of Med. Examâ€™rs, 305 S.C. 281, 285, 408 S.E.2d 213, 215 (1991) (holding this court will not consider any fact not appearing in the record on appeal).Â  Â \r\nIII.Â  Admission of Documents\r\nHusband alleges the family court erred in admitting the income and expense reports from Husbandâ€™s employer into evidence to establish his income.Â  Moreover, Husband argues the family court erred in admitting the deed and related documents associated with the former marital residence.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs to the income and expense reports of Husbandâ€™s employer, Rule 7, SCRFC, provides certain documents shall be admissible â€œwithout requiring that the persons or institutions issuing the documents or statements be present in court.â€Â  Rule 7(e) allows admissibility of a â€œwritten statement of an employer showing wages either weekly or monthly for a given period of time and W-2 statement, income tax returns and other reports of like nature.â€Â  We find no abuse of discretion in the admission of the income and expense reports to calculate the income of Husband, as the documents fit comfortably within the parameters of Rule 7(e).\r\nAs to the deed and related mortgage documents admitted in evidence over Husbandâ€™s objection, we find no abuse of discretion in their admission.Â  Rule 902 of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence allows admission of deed and mortgage documents as self-authenticating documents.Â  The deed and other documents are those documents authorized by law to be recorded in a public office, and therefore, fall within the purview of Rule 902.Â  See S.C. Code Â§ 30-9-30 (Supp. 2004); Rule 803(14),\r\nSCRE. \r\nIV.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nHusband argues the family court abused its discretion in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees lies within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Bowen v. Bowen, 327 S.C. 561, 563, 490 S.E.2d 271, 272 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  The family court, in determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, should consider each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fees, the beneficial results obtained, the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions, and the effect of the fee on the partiesâ€™ standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  In determining the reasonable amount of attorneyâ€™s fees to award, the court should consider the nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered, the time necessarily devoted to the case, counselâ€™s professional standing, the contingency of compensation, the beneficial results obtained, and the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).Â  The family court appropriately considered these factors. \r\nThe family court further noted Husbandâ€™s recalcitrance and lack of good faith.Â  Husband â€œfiled no answer,â€ â€œmade no good faith efforts to negotiate a settlement,â€ â€œwas not truthful on his financial declaration as to his income,â€ and forced â€œWifeâ€™s attorney to go through the efforts of obtaining a foreign subpoena to obtainâ€ his income records.Â  The family court order reflects other similar negative findings concerning Husbandâ€™s lack of good faith in the family court litigation.Â  Husbandâ€™s lack of cooperation throughout the process clearly burdened Wifeâ€™s counsel with considerable efforts that would have otherwise been unnecessary. We find no abuse of discretion in the award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe order of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Husband did not file an answer.Â  Rule 17(a), SCRFC, provides in part that a non-answering â€œdefendant may be heard at the merits hearing on issues of . . . equitable distribution.â€Â  We need not decide the extent of the privilegeâ€”to be â€œheardâ€â€”available to a non-answering defendant in family court in connection with the equitable distribution of the marital estate, for Husbandâ€™s efforts to classify the purported tax liabilities as marital debt were not challenged at trial.Â  Rule 15(b), SCRCP, which is applicable in family court, provides that issues tried with the consent of the parties â€œshall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.â€ \r\n[2] Rule 59, SCRCP, is applicable in family court pursuant to Rule 2,\r\nSCRFC.\r\n[3] Although the 1997 tax liability is apportioned between the parties for equitable division purposes, we direct that Husband shall remain solely responsible for this obligation to the taxing authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-194","title":"SCDSS v.

Theron Floydâ€™s motion for summary judgment. We affirm. [1]\r\nThomas Crowley executed a note with 1st Atlantic Bank on July 17, 1989.Â  Babb personally endorsed and guaranteed the note.Â  Crowley subsequently filed for bankruptcy and his liability on the note was discharged. Crowley later reaffirmed his debt by renewing the note with the bank.Â  Babb again guaranteed the note. Crowley ultimately defaulted.Â Â  \r\nAnchor Bank, as successor to 1st Atlantic Bank, brought an action against Babb to recover on Babbâ€™s guarantee.Â  In his answer, Babb denied liability and asserted a third-party complaint against Crowley and Floyd.Â  Babb alleged he detrimentally relied on a promise by Floyd to pay toward the satisfaction of Crowleyâ€™s note.Â  A jury returned a verdict in favor of the bank against Babb and in favor of Babb against Crowley.Â  The trial court dismissed Babbâ€™s action against Floyd pursuant to Rule 40(j), SCRCP.Â  Babb moved to restore the action against Floyd, and the trial court granted his motion.Â  Floyd moved for summary judgment, arguing Babb failed to produce a written document evidencing Floydâ€™s promise to pay as required by the Statute of Frauds.Â  The trial court granted Floydâ€™s motion.Â  Babb appeals.Â Â Â  \r\nBabb argues the trial court erred in granting Floydâ€™s motion for summary judgment because his detrimental reliance on a promise by Floyd to pay toward the satisfaction of Crowleyâ€™s note rendered the Statute of Frauds inoperative.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nTo establish detrimental reliance on a promise to pay, a party must show he suffered a greater detriment than he would have incurred had the promise to pay not been made.Â  Wachovia Bank of SC v. Thomasko, 339 S.C. 592, 529 S.E.2d 554 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  In this case, Babb cannot demonstrate he suffered a greater detriment.Â  This is because he remained liable on the original note notwithstanding Crowleyâ€™s bankruptcy.Â  See AMA Mgt Corp. v. Strasburger, 309 S.C. 213, 420 S.E.2d 868 (Ct.

Dudek, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General S. Creighton Waters, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Druanne D. White, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This appeal arises from the conviction of Landrecus Cowan for murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime.Â  Cowan argues that hearsay was improperly admitted under the excited utterance exception and that the court improperly allowed the State to shift the burden of proof.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn July 14, 2001, Maurice Holloway won a substantial amount of money while playing craps at a â€œgambling trailer.â€[1] Appellant Landrecus Cowan was also at the trailer that day.Â  During the evening, Holloway was shot in the arm and head, and he later died in the hospital.\r\nAt trial, Deputy Darryl Hill testified he was the first officer on the scene.Â  Hill testified that he accompanied the victim to the hospital, and at the hospital Stanley Brownlee and Larry Stowers told him Cowan had shot the victim twice.Â  The defense objected to the introduction of Hillâ€™s testimony concerning Brownlee and Stowers on the grounds it was hearsay.Â  The trial court overruled the objection, finding the statements were excited utterances and therefore fell within an exception to the rule against hearsay. \r\nWhen the defense presented its case, Cowan testified and admitted going into the trailer to place bets at the craps table; however, he claimed he was outside drinking beer with other people when the shooting occurred.Â  The solicitor challenged his testimony in her cross-examination as follows:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    STATE: Now you knew who was playing at the craps table because you were in and out; isnâ€™t that right?\r\n    COWAN: Yes, maâ€™am.\r\n    STATE: Where is the person that was at the craps table that saw the real shooter?Â  You have subpoena power, donâ€™t you?\r\n    COWAN: I donâ€™t know.\r\n    STATE: Well, there were a bunch of people in the trailer, werenâ€™t there? \r\n    COWAN: Yes maâ€™am.\r\n    STATE: And you know them.Â  You hang out there.Â  Your friends, your family hang out there, donâ€™t they?\r\n    DEFENSE COUNSEL:Â  I object to this line of questioning your honor.\r\n    THE COURT: Whatâ€™s your objection?Â  Whatâ€™s your legal objection?\r\n    DEFENSE COUNSEL: Itâ€™s a burden-shifting type question.\r\n    THE COURT: I overrule at this time.Â  Go ahead, solicitor.Â  Do you want to rephrase your question?\r\n    STATE: So, whoâ€™s the real shooter, Mr. Cowan?\r\n    COWAN: To me, Darius Thomas was the real shooter.\r\n    STATE: Oh, heâ€™s the real shooter?\r\n    COWAN: Thatâ€™s what I believe.\r\n    STATE:Â  I see.Â  But itâ€™s not you?\r\n    COWAN: No , Maâ€™am, it wasnâ€™t me.\r\n  \r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the trial, the court charged the jury on the law, including the statement, â€œthe burden of proof is upon the State to establish by evidence to your satisfaction the guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .â€Â  The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the offenses of murder and possession of a firearm or knife during the commission of a violent crime.Â  Cowan was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder and five years for the weapons charge.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Excited utterance\r\nCowan argues the trial court improperly used the excited utterance exception to admit hearsay evidence regarding his guilt.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;'Hearsay' is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.â€Â  Rule 801(c), SCRE.Â  While the general rule is that hearsay evidence cannot be admitted at trial, a number of exceptions exist.Â  See Rules 802 and 803, SCRE.Â  One exception is an excited utterance.Â  Rule 803(c), SCRE.Â  An excited utterance is a â€œstatement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n&quot;The rationale behind the excited utterance exception is that the startling event suspends the declarantâ€™s process of reflective thought, reducing the likelihood of fabrication.&quot;Â  State v. Sims, 348 S.C. 16, 20, 558 S.E.2d 518, 521&nbsp;(2002).Â  For a statement to be considered an excited utterance, three elements must be met: (1) the statement must relate to the startling event; (2) it must have been made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement; and (3) the stress of excitement must be caused by the startling event or condition.Â  Id. at 21, 558 S.E.2d at 521.Â  It is within the trial courtâ€™s discretion to determine whether, under the totality of the circumstances, a statement falls within the excited utterance exception.Â  Id.; State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 94, 544 S.E.2d 30, 34 (2001). \r\nIn this case, Brownlee and Stowers witnessed a shooting and death.Â  It cannot be seriously argued they were not impacted by a startling event.Â  What is argued, however, is that the statements were not made when Brownlee and Stowers were still under the stress of the startling event.Â  \r\nIn laying the foundation for an excited utterance, Officer Hill explained he arrived at the scene of the shooting approximately three minutes after he was dispatched to the scene, he saw people running from a trailer, and his exchange with Stowers and Brownlee took place fifteen to twenty minutes after the shooting.Â  Hill explained that Stowers â€œhad been cryingâ€ and â€œwas real upset.â€Â  Brownlee was described as acting â€œ[n]ormal.Â  Maybe a little agitated, maybe.â€Â  Hill also testified that in his experience people respond to tragic events in different ways.Â  The demeanor of Stowers supports the trial courtâ€™s decision to allow the evidence because it suggests Stowers was still impacted by the shooting.Â  \r\nWhether Brownlee, who was acting â€œnormalâ€ or â€œa little agitated,â€ was still under the stress of the event is a closer question.Â  However, the declarantâ€™s demeanor is not the only circumstance to consider; the court should also look to the severity of the startling event.Â  Sims, 348 S.C. at 22, 558 S.E.2d at 521.Â  Considering Browlee witnessed a fatal shooting within thirty minutes of his statement, we do not believe the trial judge abused his discretion by allowing the statement into evidence.\r\nII.&nbsp; Burden shifting\r\nCowan also argues the trial court erred by allowing the State to improperly shift the burden of proof.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhile being cross-examined, Cowan admitted he knew the people who were playing craps with the victim.Â  The solicitor asked Cowan: &quot;Where is the person that was at the craps table that saw the real shooter?Â  You have subpoena power, donâ€™t you?&quot; Â The defense objected to the line of questioning, arguing it shifted the burden of proof onto the defense.Â  The trial court overruled the objection, and the solicitor next challenged Cowan to name the real shooter.Â  Cowan argues these questions constituted impermissible burden-shifting.[2]Â  \r\nIt is the burden of the State to establish each element of each offense by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970). â€œA shifting of the burden of proof would impose a significantly greater onus on the defendant and, even more significantly, it would obliterate the presumption of innocence.â€Â  State v. Attardo, 263 S.C. 546, 552, 21 S.E.2d 868, 870 (1975).Â  Ordinarily, the trial court should instruct the jury not to draw inferences from the defendantâ€™s failure to call witnesses.Â  Douglas v. State, 332 S.C. 67, 71, 504 S.E.2d 307, 309 (1998).Â  â€œHowever, where . . . the defendant presents evidence at trial, and â€˜there are witnesses, seemingly accessible to the accused, or under his control, who are or should be cognizant of material and relevant facts and competent to testify thereto, and whose testimony would presumably aid him or substantiate his story if it were true, it is not improper for the prosecuting attorney to comment upon [defendantâ€™s] failure to produce them.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting State v. Shackelford, 228 S.C. 9, 11, 88 S.E.2d 778, 779 (1955)) (brackets in original).Â  Cf. State v. Posey, 269 S.C. 500, 504, 238 S.E.2d 176, 177 (1977) (prohibiting the State from telling the fact-finder to draw a negative inference when the defendant fails to present any evidence at trial).\r\nIn Douglas v. State, an appeal from a post-conviction relief hearing, Douglas argued the trial court erred in refusing to give a curative instruction after the solicitor referred to his failure to call certain witnesses.Â  332 S.C. at 70, 504 S.E.2d at 308. During the Stateâ€™s closing argument, the solicitor stated, â€œOne thing they short me on is I didnâ€™t put these officers up.Â  Well, I tell you one thing, they can call witnesses just like I can.â€ Defense counsel objected, but the trial judge refused to give a curative instruction.Â  Our supreme court affirmed, finding the solicitorâ€™s argument was proper because Douglas had produced other witnesses. Id. at 71, 504 S.E.2d at 309.Â  Likewise, in State v. Bamberg, our supreme court found no error in allowing the State to comment on the defendantâ€™s failure to call witnesses to establish his alibi defense.Â  270 S.C. 77, 80-81, 240 S.E.2d 639, 640 (1977); see also Shackelford, 228 S.C. at 9, 88 S.E.2d at 779 (allowing comment regarding defendantâ€™s failure to call alibi witness).\r\nIn this case, Cowan also produced other witnesses on his behalf.Â  Thus, it was not improper for the solicitor to comment on Cowanâ€™s failure to produce the individuals who were playing craps with the victim and whose testimony would substantiate Cowanâ€™s story if it were true.Â  Additionally, the trial judgeâ€™s jury charge explained that the State had the burden of proving Cowanâ€™s guilt, thereby mitigating any possible confusion caused by the solicitorâ€™s cross-examination.Â  Accordingly, Cowanâ€™s convictions are\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\n[1] The &quot;gambling trailer&quot; was a modified mobile home where people gathered to play cards, drink alcohol, and socialize.\r\n[2] In addition to claiming Cowanâ€™s argument has no merit, the State argues this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  However, we find defense counselâ€™s objection was sufficiently contemporaneous to preserve the error.Â  See State v. Gray, 304 S.C. 482, 484, 405 S.E.2d 420, 421 (Ct. App. 1991).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-198","title":"Baker v.

Baker, Respondent,\r\n        v.\r\n        Williams Roofing and Construction, Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Aiken County\r\nÂ James C. Williams, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-198\r\nSubmitted February 1, 2005 â€“ Filed March 18, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        M. Anderson Griffith, of Aiken, for Appellant.\r\n        Greg S. Baker, of Evans, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Williams Roofing and Construction appeals a circuit court order affirming, as modified, a decision rendered by the magistrateâ€™s court.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nGreg Baker contracted with Williams Roofing and Construction (Williams) to replace the roof on his home for the quoted price of $7,500.Â  Williams replaced the roof, but Baker was not satisfied and subsequently complained of problems with the roof and Williamsâ€™ performance under the contract.Â  \r\nApproximately a year later, Baker filed a breach of contract action against Williams in magistrateâ€™s court.Â  In his complaint, Baker complained of delay in replacing the roof, substandard workmanship, and various other problems.Â  At the close of Bakerâ€™s case, Williams moved for a directed verdict asserting Baker failed to present any evidence of his damages.Â  The magistrateâ€™s court denied Williamsâ€™ requests â€œfor the fact that the defense used a transcript from a previous hearing and the plaintiff stated damages made by the defendant in that hearing.â€Â  \r\nThe magistrateâ€™s court found in favor of Baker and awarded him $3,750 in damages and $55 in costs.Â  Williams filed a motion for reconsideration, which the magistrateâ€™s court denied.Â  Subsequently, Williams appealed the magistrate courtâ€™s decision to the circuit court arguing the magistrateâ€™s court erred in denying its motion for directed verdict or alternatively, that â€œthe court erred in rendering a verdict for the [defendant] based on evidence which was not submitted at this trial.â€Â  The circuit court conducted a hearing and determined Baker did indeed provide evidence of his damages.Â  \r\nThe circuit court based its determination on the undisputed testimony that Williams agreed to replace his entire roof for $7,500, photos of the roof depicting the damage, and Bakerâ€™s testimony that several roofers told him that in order to guarantee their work the entire roof would have to be replaced.Â  The circuit court affirmed the magistrate courtâ€™s order, but modified it by increasing the award to Baker to $7,500 plus $55 in costs.Â  The circuit court increased the award based on its finding that there was no evidence to â€œsustain the amount awarded to the plaintiff by the magistrate.â€Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSection 14-5-340 of the South Carolina Code (1976), allows a circuit court to hear appeals from magistrateâ€™s court.Â  Section 18-7-170 of the South Carolina Code (1976), provides:Â  \r\n\r\n  Upon hearing the appeal the appellate court shall give judgment according to the justice of the case, without regard to technical errors and defects which do not affect the merits.Â  In giving judgment the court may affirm or reverse the judgment of the court below, in whole or in part, as to any or all the parties and for errors of law or fact.\r\n\r\nThis section allows the circuit court, in its review of the magistrate courtâ€™s decision, to correct errors of law or fact.Â  In our review of the circuit courtâ€™s decision, we may not reverse findings of fact if any evidence exists to support them.Â  Vacation Time of Hilton Head Island, Inc., v. Kiwi Corp., 280 S.C. 232, 233, 312 S.E.2d 20, 21 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Directed Verdict\r\nWilliams argues the circuit court erred in finding the magistrateâ€™s court properly denied its motion for a directed verdict.Â  Williams asserts Baker failed to present any evidence of his damages at the magistrateâ€™s court hearing, and therefore, the magistrateâ€™s court erred in denying his motions for directed verdict.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n  When reviewing the denial of a motion for directed verdict or JNOV, an appellate court must employ the same standard as the trial court by viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  The appellate court will reverse the trial court only where there is no evidence to support the ruling below.Â  \r\n\r\nElam v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 27-28, 602 S.E.2d 772, 782 (2004) (citations omitted).Â  \r\nThe record supports the circuit courtâ€™s determination that evidence of Bakerâ€™s damages did exist.Â  Although we do not have a complete transcript from the hearing before the magistrateâ€™s court, the pleadings undisputedly indicate the parties entered into a contract in which Williams agreed to replace the roof on Bakerâ€™s home for $7,500.Â  Additionally, Baker testified during the magistrateâ€™s court hearing, â€œI couldnâ€™t get nobody out to give me a price because they wonâ€™t do it.Â  They said theyâ€™ll have to do the whole roof.Â  Everybody weâ€™ve called.â€Â  Bakerâ€™s testimony provides evidence of the need for the roof to be replaced.Â  In addition, the contract itself provides evidence of the cost to replace the roof.Â  Thus, we find evidence exists to support the circuit courtâ€™s decision to deny Williamsâ€™ request for a directed verdict. \r\nIn addition, Williams challenges the magistrate courtâ€™s reliance on a transcript from a previous hearing for evidence of Bakerâ€™s damages.Â  He asserts this transcript was not admitted into evidence, and therefore, the magistrateâ€™s court incorrectly relied upon it.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s order does not indicate it relied on the transcript in finding evidence of Bakerâ€™s damages.Â  In fact, the circuit court, in its order, specified that evidence of Bakerâ€™s damages consisted of the original agreement between the parties, the photographs provided by Baker, and Bakerâ€™s own testimony.Â  Because the circuit court may make its own findings of fact in reviewing an appeal from the magistrateâ€™s court, we need not address this issue.Â  See Parks v. Characters Night Club, 345 S.C. 484, 490, 548 S.E.2d 605, 608 (Ct. App. 2001) (stating section 18-7-170 of the South Carolina Code allows the circuit court to make its own findings of fact on an appeal from magistrateâ€™s court).Â  \r\nII.Â  Modification of Award\r\nNext, Williams argues the circuit court improperly increased the magistrate courtâ€™s award from $3,750 to $7,500.Â  We agree.\r\nNotwithstanding the circuit courtâ€™s broad standard of review in hearing appeals from magistrate courts, the circuit court erred in increasing the amount of the award.Â Â  In this case, the circuit court increased the award based on its finding that there was no evidence to sustain the amount awarded by the magistrate.Â  \r\nThis holding incorrectly suggests that a verdict must strictly conform to the testimony concerning damages presented at trial, which it does not.Â  In Powers Construction Company, Inc. v. Salem Carpets, Inc., 283 S.C. 302, 322 S.E.2d 30 (Ct. App. 1984), a defendant asserted that a jury verdict of one-half the amount of damages proven was inconsistent with the evidence presented at trial and thus was an improper decision by the fact finder.Â  Id. at 310, 322 S.E.2d at 35.Â  We disagreed, finding that â€œproof of the larger amount necessarily included the smaller,â€ thus â€œappellant has no ground to complain of the favorable consideration of the jury.â€Â  Id. at 311, 322 S.E.2d at 35; see also, Piedmont Aviation, Inc., v. D. Quinn, 294 S.C. 502, 504-05, 366 S.E.2d 31, 32 (Ct. App. 1988) (holding same).[1]\r\nTherefore, after determining that Baker presented evidence of his damages, the circuit court should have affirmed the magistrate courtâ€™s award of $3,750 and costs.Â  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s order is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.\r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The circuit courtâ€™s increase in Bakerâ€™s award is particularly troubling considering that Baker did not appeal from the magistrateâ€™s order.Â  See, e.g., Williamsburg Rural Water and Sewer Co. Inc. v. Williamsburg County Water and Sewer Authority, 357 S.C. 251, 272, 593 S.E.2d 154, 165-66 (Ct. App. 2003) (holding issues not raised on appeal become the law of the case).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-199","title":"State v.

Cooper, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No.Â  2005-UP-201\r\nHeard March 8, 2005 â€“ Filed March 18, 2005\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tJohn H. Tiller and Neil D. Thompson, both of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tHelen Tyler McFadden and Ronnie Alan Sabb, both of Kingstree, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Clara McCray, personal representative for the estate of decedent Clarence Bright, appeals from a jury verdict in favor of Matherine Brown, personal representative for the estate of decedent Herbert L. Brown.Â  Brightâ€™s estate asserts that the trial court erred in denying her motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.Â  We affirm.\r\n \r\nThis case arises from a fatal automobile accident involving a truck driven by Bright.Â  Brown was a passenger.Â  The accident occurred when Bright failed to negotiate a curve and the truck struck two trees.Â  Expert testimony reveals that approximately seven seconds elapsed from the time the truck left the road until it came to a rest.Â  A witness who arrived at the scene shortly after the accident testified that when she looked into the truck, she noticed that the Bright was already dead, but she observed Brown moving, breathing, and moaning.Â  She also observed that the interior light was on.Â  The witness further testified that she left the scene for about fifteen minutes to call an ambulance, and Brown was still alive when she returned.Â  Brown died, however, before the ambulance arrived.\r\nBrownâ€™s estate brought a wrongful death and a survival action against Brightâ€™s estate.Â  Brightâ€™s estate moved for a directed verdict on the survival action, and the motion was denied.Â  The jury returned a verdict for Brownâ€™s estate. Brightâ€™s estate moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict arguing Brownâ€™s estate failed to establish conscious pain and suffering. The trial court denied the motion, and this appeal followed.\r\n \r\nIn ruling on a motion for JNOV, the trial judge must view the evidence and the inferences that can reasonably be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Force v. Richland Memâ€™l Hosp., 322 S.C. 283, 284, 471 S.E.2d 714, 715 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The trial judge must deny the motion when the evidence yields more than one inference or its inferences are in doubt.Â  Jinks v. Richland County, 355 S.C. 341, 345, 585 S.E.2d 281, 283 (2003).Â  Moreover, a motion for JNOV may be granted only if no reasonable jury could have reached the challenged verdict.Â  Gastineau v. Murphy, 331 S.C. 565, 568, 503 S.E.2d 712, 713 (1998).Â  The verdict will be upheld if there is any evidence to sustain the factual findings implicit in the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  Shupe v. Settle, 315 S.C. 510, 515, 445 S.E.2d 651, 654 (Ct. App.1994).\r\nThe South Carolina survival statute provides that a cause of action for personal injuries survives the decedentâ€™s death.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-5-90 (1976).Â  Damages for a decedentâ€™s conscious pain and suffering are recoverable, but there must be proof that the decedent consciously suffered prior to death.Â  Smalls v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Educ., 339 S.C. 208, 216, 528 S.E.2d 682, 686 (Ct. App. 2000); Croft v. Hall, 208 S.C. 187, 193, 37 S.E.2d 537, 539 (1946).Â  A scintilla of evidence that the victim was conscious prior to death is sufficient to create a jury question.Â  Smalls, 339 S.C. at 216-17, 528 S.E.2d at 686-87. \r\n \r\nSouth Carolina courts have examined the existence of evidence of conscious pain and suffering on several occasions.Â  In Croft v. Hall, 208 S.C. 187, 194, 37 S.E.2d 537, 539 (1946), the supreme court found witness testimony that the decedent made â€œterrible noises,â€ talked, and appeared to recognize her mother sufficiently created a jury question.Â  In Bowers v. Charleston &amp; W.C. Ry. Co., 210 S.C. 367, 372, 42 S.E.2d 705, 707 (1947), a witness testified the decedent was â€œwhining and drawing up,â€ and groaning and struggling for breath.Â  Again, the supreme court allowed the case to go to the jury.Â  This Court recently considered the issue in Smalls v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Educ., 339 S.C. 208, 216, 528 S.E.2d 682, 686 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  In Smalls, the decedentâ€™s father testified that he observed the decedent â€œgasping for air and moaning somewhat.â€ Id. at 217, 528 S.E.2d at 686-87.Â  He further testified he believed she could hear him and believed that she responded through movement of her fingers. Id.Â  This court held the evidence was sufficient to create a jury question, and noted â€œ[i]f there is any evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude a decedent experienced conscious pain and suffering, the issue must be submitted to the jury.â€Â  Id., (quoting Vereen v. Liberty Life Ins. Co., 306 S.C. 423, 432, 412 S.E.2d 425, 431 (Ct. App. 1991)).Â  But cf. Camp v. Petroleum Carrier Corp., 204 S.C. 133, 28 S.E.2d 683 (1944) (holding the evidence failed to show an accident victim was conscious of pain and suffering where one witness heard the victim groan and the other witnesses saw no signs of life.) \r\n \r\nWe think the evidence, recited above, is sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find Brown experienced conscious pain and suffering.Â  \r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ. concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-202","title":"Crotts v.

Crotts and Sandra Crotts married in 1981.Â  They raised one child who is now an adult.Â  Throughout the marriage, Husband worked in the sanitation business.Â  Wife was employed in the textile industry, but left the workforce in 1995 as a result of suicidal thoughts, severe depression, and bipolar disorder.Â  After consulting with a physician, Wife made a claim for social security disability benefits. Â Beginning in 1996 and continuing until the time of marital litigation, Wifeâ€™s monthly disability checks have been her sole source of personal income.Â \r\n \r\nWifeâ€™s mental illness took its toll on the coupleâ€™s marriage.Â  After her diagnosis, Wife was treated by physicians, took prescription medication, and was hospitalized several times.Â  Because of her illness, Husband took primary responsibility for household duties.Â  The couple eventually decided to separate, and Husband moved out of the marital residence.\r\n \r\nIn December 2001, Husband filed for divorce on the ground of habitual drug use.Â  Wife submitted an answer in which she denied the allegation of habitual drug use and filed a counterclaim seeking an order of separate support and maintenance, equitable distribution of the marital estate, attorneyâ€™s fees, and alimony.Â  The family court issued a temporary order awarding Wife $650 per month in alimony until the caseâ€™s final resolution.\r\n \r\nAfter the temporary hearing, but before the final divorce hearing, Husband hired a private investigator to look into Wifeâ€™s relationship with an alleged paramour, Winfred Crowe.Â  The private investigator conducted surveillance of Wife for two months.Â  Thereafter, Husband amended his complaint to seek divorce on the ground of adultery.\r\n \r\nAt trial, Husband submitted an â€œInvestigative Reportâ€ by the private investigator into evidence.Â  The private investigator testified he saw Croweâ€™s car at Wifeâ€™s home on several occasions and once saw Crowe enter Wifeâ€™s home at night and leave the next morning.Â  Based upon these observations, he concluded Crowe was living with Wife and they were participating in an adulterous relationship.Â  Husbandâ€™s daughter from a previous marriage testified Wife once inadvertently referred to Crowe as her â€œboyfriend.â€Â  It was also undisputed that Wife included Crowe on her car insurance.Â Â Â Â Â \r\n \r\nWife admitted that Crowe did in fact live in her house, but insisted they did not engage in a sexual relationship.Â  Wife asserted that Crowe, although he did not contribute to household expenses, was allowed to sleep in an extra bedroom in exchange for performing various chores and driving her around when medication prevented her from safely doing so herself.Â  This living situation, according to Wife, resulted in the decision to include Crowe on her car insurance.Â  Wife sought to corroborate this position with testimony from her psychiatrist, but the family court excluded his testimony on the ground of unfair surprise to Husband.[1]Â  The court did, however, allow Wife to proffer the doctorâ€™s testimony regarding her medications and their possible side effects, including sexual dysfunction.\r\nThe family court awarded Husband a divorce on the ground of adultery and thus barred Wife from receiving alimony.Â  The court also distributed the marital estate and denied both partiesâ€™ request for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  This appeal followed.\r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family court, this court has jurisdiction to find the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 328, 526 S.E.2d 241, 244-45 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  This court, however, is not required to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings; nor should we ignore the fact that the family court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their testimony.Â  Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 202, 522 S.E.2d 835, 838 (Ct. App. 1999); Smith v. Smith, 327 S.C. 448, 453, 486 S.E.2d 516, 519 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Questions regarding alimony and equitable distribution are committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, whose decision will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. Thornton v. Thornton, 328 S.C. 96, 111, 492 S.E.2d 86, 94 (1997); Rogers v. Rogers, 280 S.C. 205, 207, 311 S.E.2d 743, 744 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Exclusion of Witness\r\nWife argues the family court erred in excluding the testimony of her doctor.Â  We agree.\r\nDetermining the appropriate sanction for late disclosure of a witness generally lies within the discretion of the trial court.Â  Barnett v. Adams Brothers Logging, 355 S.C. 588, 592, 586 S.E.2d 572, 574 (2003).Â  This rule, however, is designed to promote decisions on the merits, and the sanction of exclusion of a witness should never be lightly invoked.Â  Id.Â  A trial judge is required to consider and evaluate the following factors before imposing the sanction of exclusion of a witness:Â  (1) the type of witness involved; (2) the content of the evidence emanating from the proffered witness; (3) the nature of the failure or neglect or refusal to furnish the witnessâ€™ name; (4) the degree of surprise to the other party, including the prior knowledge of the name of the witness; and (5) the prejudice to the opposing party.Â  Id. (citing Jumper v. Hawkins, 348 S.C. 142, 152, 558 S.E.2d 911, 916 (Ct. App. 2001)). \r\n \r\nIn the present case, the trial court made no specific findings concerning the required considerations enumerated above.Â  Instead, his decision to exclude the doctorâ€™s testimony was based solely on Wifeâ€™s counselâ€™s statement at the prior hearing that he planned on calling Wife as his only witness.Â  Although Wifeâ€™s counsel did make this statement at the initial hearing while the court was considering a prudent resolution to a scheduling dilemma, we do not believe it was binding on Wife.Â  Husband did not seek discovery in this case, nor was there a pre-trial order requiring the parties to exchange a list of witnesses; thus, Wife was under no obligation to limit her case to just her testimony.Â  Because no such obligation arose, Husband claims of unfair surprise and prejudice are weak, and there is no basis for finding fault in Wifeâ€™s failure to name the witness.\r\nWe are further persuaded that this exclusion was erroneous when considering the type of witness excluded and the probable content of his testimony.Â  In order to establish a prima facie case of adultery, a party must present evidence of both the opportunity and the inclination to commit adultery.Â  Panhorst v. Panhorst, 301 S.C. 100, 102, 390 S.E.2d 376, 377 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  When attempting to prove inclination,â€œ[e]vidence placing a spouse and a third party together on several occasions, without more, does not warrant the conclusion that adultery was committed.â€Â  Hartley, 292 S.C. at 246-47, 355 S.E.2d at 871.Â  Wifeâ€™s doctorâ€™s testimony was offered to show she lacked the inclination to commit adultery and was her sole evidentiary corroboration of this assertion.Â  Consideration of his testimony was critical to her case, especially when considering the tenuous nature of Husbandâ€™s evidence on the element of inclination.\r\nOur review of the record indicates the family court erred in excluding Wifeâ€™s doctorâ€™s testimony. We therefore reverse the family courtâ€™s order on that basis and remand the case for a full review of whether a statutory ground for divorce exists, adultery or otherwise.Â  Should the family court find grounds for divorce on remand, we also invite reconsideration of the applicable factors enumerated in section 20-3-130 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004) and a possible determination of alimony. \r\n \r\nII. Equitable Apportionment of the Marital Property\r\nWife also seeks a revision of the equitable apportionment of the marital estate.Â  She argues the trial court erred when it failed to identify and value the marital property.Â  We agree.\r\nSection 20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004) lists fifteen factors the court must consider in making an equitable apportionment of the marital estate, including the identity and value of the marital property.Â  This court will affirm the family court if it can be determined that the judge addressed these factors in a manner sufficient for us to conclude he was cognizant of them. Walker v. Walker, 295 S.C. 286, 288, 368 S.E.2d 89, 90 (Ct. App. 1988); see also Rule 26(a), SCRFC (â€œAn order or judgment pursuant to an adjudication in a domestic relations case shall set forth the specific findings of fact and conclusions of law to support the court's decision.â€).\r\nAlthough the order states the family court gave â€œdue consideration to all the statutory factorsâ€ in arriving at its decision, the family court merely granted each party the personal property currently in their possession.Â  We cannot glean from the record or the family courtâ€™s order that the court properly addressed the statutory factors, namely the identity and value of the marital property, in determining that this distribution was equitable.Â  Furthermore, the statute calls for consideration of the partiesâ€™ marital misconduct or fault when determining the equitable distribution of the marital assets.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472(2) (Supp. 2004).Â  Because we find that the exclusion of Wifeâ€™s doctorâ€™s testimony tainted the family courtâ€™s finding of infidelity, we are further persuaded to remand the equitable distribution of the marital estate for reconsideration.[2]\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the family courtâ€™s decision is \r\n \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The final divorce hearing was scheduled to last until 12:30 on May 30, 2003, but around noon it became clear the hearing would probably run over the allotted time as Wife had yet to begin her case.Â  Wifeâ€™s counsel indicated that Wife would be his sole witness, but the court nevertheless decided to continue the case until June 20.Â  On that date, Wifeâ€™s counsel sought to submit the testimony of both Wife and her doctor.Â  Husband objected based on Wifeâ€™s counselâ€™s prior statement that he would only be presenting Wifeâ€™s testimony. The court agreed.\r\n[2]Â  We leave the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees to the family courtâ€™s discretion upon reconsideration of the issues addressed herein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-203","title":"Germeroth v.

In September 1978, PAR recorded a preliminary plat, which showed the subdivision of a portion of the tract into residential lots.&nbsp; Later that year, covenants were filed, restricting the use of the lots to single family residential use.&nbsp; The covenants were expressly limited to only a portion of the larger tract as follows:\r\n\r\n\tAll those certain lots or tracts of land lying, being and situate[d] off India Hook Road . . . and being shown and designated as Lots 3 through 52, inclusive as shown on map of Brookwood Subdivision, drawn by Campco Engineering recorded in Plat Book 56 at Page 39 in the Office of the Clerk of Court for York County, South Carolina.&nbsp;\r\n\t\r\n\r\nParagraph 18 of the covenants provided for a possible expansion of the covenantsâ€™ applicability:\r\n\r\n\tIt is understood that grantor may expand the area covered by these Restrictions to a maximum of 121.124 acres presently owned by grantor and as further portions of said property are developed and subdivision plats recorded, then lots as shown on such recorded plats shall be included within the total number of lots as are affected by the provisions of this paragraph.&nbsp; \r\n\t\r\n\r\nA final plat was filed in 1979.&nbsp; It designated several new residential lots, but contained one large unidentified parcel abutting India Hook Road. \r\n \r\nThe large parcel was sold to Thomasson in 1981.&nbsp; The deed does not mention the restrictions placed on the residential lots in Brookwood; however, it does contain its own restrictions.&nbsp; Some of the restrictions in the deed for the large parcel are contradictory to the restrictions placed on the numbered residential lots in the Brookwood subdivision.&nbsp;\r\n \r\nSometime in late 2002 or early 2003, Hospice agreed to purchase a portion of Thomassonâ€™s property to build and operate a Title 44 hospice facility and administration building.&nbsp; Appellants, residents of the Brookwood Subdivision, oppose the construction of the facility and instituted this action seeking to restrict the property based upon the restrictive covenants filed for the lots of Brookwood.\r\n \r\nThomasson and Hospice filed a motion to dismiss, which was later considered as a motion for summary judgment.&nbsp; Appellants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.&nbsp; The court denied Appellantsâ€™ motion for summary judgment and granted the motions by Hospice and Thomasson.&nbsp; This appeal followed the trial courtâ€™s denial of Appellantsâ€™ motion to alter or amend the judgment.&nbsp; Prior to this courtâ€™s consideration of the appeal, Hospice entered a settlement with Appellants and has been dismissed from the case by consent of the parties.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.&nbsp; Dawkins v.

Mootness\r\nAs stated previously, Hospice settled with Appellants during the pendency of this appeal and agreed not to build on the Brookwood site.&nbsp; Appellants devote much of their brief to the issue of Hospiceâ€™s attorneyâ€™s disqualification, an issue we now find moot due to Hospiceâ€™s withdrawal from the present appeal.&nbsp; However, because Thomasson has repeatedly expressed, in word and action, its intention of developing the parcel, we address Appellantâ€™s other issues. See Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 568,&nbsp; 549 S.E.2d 591, 596 (2001) (â€œ[I]f a decision by the trial court may affect future events, or have collateral consequences for the parties, an appeal from that decision is not moot . . . .â€).\r\nII. Restrictive Covenants\r\nAppellants contend the trial court erred in finding Thomassonâ€™s property was not bound by the same restrictive covenants as the residential lots of the Brookwood Subdivision.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\n\r\n\tAs explained in Taylor v. Lindsey, 332 S.C. 1, 498 S.E.2d 862 (1998):\r\n\t\r\n\t\tRestrictive covenants are contractual in nature, so that the paramount rule of construction is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the parties as determined from the whole document.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe court may not limit a restriction in a deed, nor, on the other hand, \r\n\t\twill a restriction be enlarged or extended by construction or implication beyond the clear meaning of its terms even to accomplish what it may be thought the parties would have desired had a situation which later developed been foreseen by them at the time when the restriction was written.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is still the settled rule in this jurisdiction that restrictions as to the use of real estate should be strictly construed and all doubts resolved in favor of free use of the property, subject, however, to the provision that this rule of strict construction should not be applied so as to defeat the plain and obvious purpose of the instrument.&nbsp; It follows, of course, that where the language of the restrictions is equally capable of two or more different constructions that construction will be adopted which least restricts the use of the property.&nbsp; A restriction on the use of property must be created in express terms or by plain and unmistakable implication, and all such restrictions are to be strictly construed, with all doubts resolved in favor of the free use of property.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nTaylor, 332 S.C. at 4-5, 498 S.E.2d at 863-64 (emphasis added)(internal citations omitted).&nbsp; The same passage was reiterated with emphasis recently by the South Carolina Supreme Court in South Carolina Depâ€™t of Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 622, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302 (2001).\r\nWe must first determine whether the language of the Brookwood covenants is ambiguous.&nbsp; We find the provisions related to the restrictive covenants are clear and capable of construction using the plain and ordinary meaning of the words found therein.&nbsp; See Heape v. Broxton, 293 S.C. 343, 345, 360 S.E.2d 157, 158 (Ct. App. 1987) (â€œWhere the language used in a restrictive covenant is unambiguous, there is no room for construction and the language must be enforced in accordance with its plain meaning.â€).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n \r\nThe covenantsâ€™ application was initially expressly restricted to the residential lots numbered 3 through 52.&nbsp; Appellants, however, contend Paragraph 18 of the covenants expands their coverage to include the Thomasson property.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nFirst, we note that the paragraph begins by using the word â€œmayâ€ in regards to the expansion of the area covered by the restrictive covenants.&nbsp; There is no indication, and Appellants do not appear to argue, the developers ever created and filed any documents expressly expanding the area restricted to include the Thomasson property.\r\nSecond, while the next portion of the paragraph does seem to indicate mandatory expansion of the restrictive covenants, this expansion is limited to â€œfurther portions of said property [which] are developed and subdivision plats recorded.â€&nbsp; Once recorded, only the â€œlots as shown on such recorded plats shall be included within the total number of lots as are affected by the provisions of this paragraph.â€ (Emphasis added). Nothing in the record indicates the Thomasson property, much larger than the residential parcels, was intended to be a â€œlotâ€ within the terms of the covenants.&nbsp; See Davey v. Artistic Builders, Inc., 263 S.C. 431, 211 S.E.2d 235 (1975) (refusing to expand the applicability of restrictive covenants to property on a subdivision plat, but not subdivided into residential lots or assigned a residential lot number).&nbsp; Accordingly, we find the trial court properly concluded the covenants, by their express terms, do not apply to the Thomasson property.\r\nEven if we were to conclude an ambiguity exists in the paragraphs of the covenant, we are bound by the recent decisions of the South Carolina Supreme Court, which require us to construe the covenants to place the least possible restriction on the fair use of the land. See Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. at 622, 550 S.E.2d at 302; Taylor, 332 S.C. at 4-5, 498 S.E.2d at 863-64.&nbsp; Appellants would have us resort to a 1958 Kentucky case for the more â€œmodernâ€ proposition that â€œbuilding restrictions are regarded more as a protection to the property owner and the public rather than as a restriction on the use of property.â€&nbsp; Brandon v. Price, 314 S.W.2d 521, 523 (Ky. 1958).&nbsp; We decline this interpretation and find the law as expressed in 2001 by our supreme court to be the accurate statement of the law in South Carolina.\r\nInterpreting the covenants pursuant to recent South Carolina case law, we conclude they do not apply to the Thomasson property.&nbsp; The record does not indicate the parties intended the large tract to be subject to the same restrictions as the lots developed specifically for residential use.&nbsp; Accordingly, we find the trial court properly granted summary judgment to Thomasson on Appellantsâ€™ claim that the property is bound by the covenants.\r\nIII. Implied Reciprocal Negative Easement\r\nAppellants also contend the trial court erred in granting Thomasson summary judgment on Appellantsâ€™ claim for an implied reciprocal negative easement.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court established the elements necessary to show an implied reciprocal negative easement as follows:\r\n\r\n\tOrdinarily, four elements must be established to show a reciprocal negative easement:\r\n\t(1) There must be a common grantor; (2) There must be a designation of the land or tract subject to restrictions; (3) There must be a general plan or scheme of restriction in existence for the designated land or tract; and (4) The restrictive covenants must run with the land.&nbsp; \r\n\t\r\n\tIf the above elements are satisfied, the restrictions are enforceable against the grantor and subsequent grantees of lots in the restricted area who take with actual or constructive notice of the restrictions.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\r\n\r\nBomar v. Echols, 270 S.C. 676, 679-80, 244 S.E.2d 308, 310 (1978).\r\nIn the instant case, the Thomasson property was not part of the general plan or scheme of restriction.&nbsp; The parcel is much larger than the residential tracts and not subdivided or assigned a lot number.&nbsp; If the grantor intended the Thomasson property to be included under the Brookwood Covenants, the deed for the Thomasson Property would not have contained its own set of restrictive covenants, some of which conflict with the provisions in the Brookwood Covenants.\r\n \r\nAs has previously been found by courts of this State, and was specifically noted by the trial court, grantors have a right to place restrictions on part of the property without restricting the remainder.&nbsp; See Dunlap v. Beatty, 239 S.C. 196, 207, 122 S.E.2d 9, 15 (1961) (finding, under circumstance of the case, grantor â€œhad a right to impose restrictions on a portion of her property without creating any obligation to restrict the remainder.â€).&nbsp; Under the circumstances of this case, we find PAR Associates never intended the Thomasson property to be included under the residential restrictions and, therefore, had the right to provide a different set of restrictive covenants for that portion of its property.&nbsp; Accordingly, we find the trial court properly granted summary judgment to Thomasson on Appellantsâ€™ claims for an implied reciprocal negative easement.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude the trial court properly granted summary judgment to Thomasson regarding Appellantsâ€™ claims for enforcement of the Brookwood subdivision restrictive covenants and the imposition of an implied reciprocal negative easement on the Thomasson property.&nbsp; Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is\r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-204","title":"State v.

Pachak, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General W. Rutledge Martin, all of Columbia; and Solicitor David M. Pascoe, Jr., of Orangeburg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Lavanza Cory Mack appeals his conviction for assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN), arguing (1) the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the charge because the indictment failed to specify an aggravating circumstance; and (2) the circuit court erred in failing to instruct the jury on any aggravating circumstances required to find ABHAN.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDUREAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn February 2003, Mack was indicted for strong-armed robbery and ABHAN.Â  The ABHAN indictment stated in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\tThat Lavanza Mack, did in Calhoun County, on or about September 24, 2002,\r\n\tcommit an assault and battery upon the victim, John A. Stoor, constituting an unlawful act of violent injury to the person of the said victim,\r\n\taccompanied by circumstances of aggravation to wit:Â  he was struck from behind requiring medical attention, and as a result violated the Common Law offense of Assault and Battery of a High and Aggravated Nature.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.).Â  Mack sought to quash the indictment in pretrial proceedings, arguing it was insufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction because the indictment failed to allege the assault and battery was of a high and aggravated nature.Â  Specifically, he argued that the language â€œrequiring medical attentionâ€ is not the equivalent of â€œserious bodily injury,â€ which is among the aggravating circumstances that may elevate a simple assault and battery to ABHAN.Â  The trial court denied the motion.\r\nThe trial court did not charge the jury on the typical examples of circumstances of aggravation, but defined circumstances of aggravation as an assault and battery â€œcommitted in a spirit of wantonness, or with a reckless disregard for the rights and safety of another . . . [and] [i]tâ€™s basically for you to determine whether there was (sic) circumstances of aggravation.â€Â  Mack objected, arguing the court erred in â€œnot requiring this jury to find the aggravating circumstance alleged in the indictment.â€Â  He added, â€œI object to not requiring them to do that, this is an open ended, they can find anything to be a circumstance of aggravation.â€Â  The court overruled the objection.\r\nMack was convicted of ABHAN and strong-armed robbery.[1]Â  This appeal follows.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. Motion to Quash ABHAN Indictment\r\nMack first argues the trial court erred in refusing to quash the ABHAN indictment because it purportedly did not specify an aggravating circumstance.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œAn indictment survives legal scrutiny if the offense is stated with sufficient certainty and particularity to enable the court to know what judgment to pronounce, and the defendant to know what he is called upon to answer and whether he may plead an acquittal or conviction thereon.â€Â  State v. Ervin, 333 S.C. 351, 355, 510 S.E.2d 220, 222 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  â€œSouth Carolina courts have held that the sufficiency of an indictment must be viewed with a practical eye.â€Â  State v. Guthrie, 352 S.C. 103, 108, 572 S.E.2d 309, 312 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\n \r\nHere, Mack apparently argues that the indictmentâ€™s allegation that Mack â€œ[s]truck [the victim] from behind requiring medical attentionâ€ was not an aggravating circumstance because it was not among those detailed in State v. Tyndall, 336 S.C. 8, 518 S.E.2d 278 (1999).Â  We find this argument unavailing.Â  In Tyndall, our supreme court stated:\r\n\r\n\tExamples of circumstances of aggravation include the use of a deadly weapon, the infliction of serious bodily injury, the intent to commit a felony, great disparity between the ages and physical conditions of the parties involved, and the difference in the sexes.Â  Other circumstances include indecent liberties or familiarities with a female, the purposeful infliction of shame and disgrace, and resistance to lawful authority.\r\n\r\nId. at 21, 518 S.E.2d at 285 (internal citation omitted).Â  Nothing in Tyndall suggests this list is exhaustive.Â  \r\n \r\nThe indictment clearly charged Mack with â€œAssault and Battery of a High and Aggravated Natureâ€ on its inside and outside captions.Â  It undisputedly alleged assault and battery.Â  Then, it specifically alleged the assault and battery was â€œaccompanied by circumstances of aggravation,â€ which it described as Mackâ€™s having â€œstruck [the victim] from behind requiring medical attention . . . .â€Â  We find the indictment, when viewed with a practical eye, clearly informed Mack that he was being charged with ABHAN and included a specific reference to an alleged â€œaggravating circumstance.â€Â  \r\n \r\nII. Jury Instruction\r\nMack next argues the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on any of the aggravating circumstances that constitute ABHAN.Â  It is true that the trial court did not charge the generally recognized examples of circumstances of aggravation.Â  At trial Mack objected to the relevant instruction on a different basis, arguing the court erred in â€œnot requiring this jury to find the aggravating circumstance alleged in the indictmentâ€ and adding, â€œI object to not requiring them to do that, this is an open ended, they can find anything to be a circumstance of aggravation.â€Â  Moreover, Mackâ€™s position at trial is at odds with the very thing he now argues on appealâ€”error in failing to charge the typical examples of circumstances of aggravation.Â  Mackâ€™s trial counsel informed the trial court, â€œI also would have objected if you had given the whole laundry list [of circumstances of aggravation].â€Â  The precise issue argued in Mackâ€™s brief is therefore not preserved for appellate review.Â  See State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 694 (2003) (â€œA party may not argue one ground at trial and an alternate ground on appealâ€).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the forgoing reasons, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] This appeal does not involve Mackâ€™s strong-armed robbery conviction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-205","title":"Sennewald v.

Lemmond and David Dolber (â€œAppellantsâ€) appeal a circuit court order enjoining them from transferring certain assets during the pendency of Sandra Shellyâ€™s action against them.Â  We affirm.Â Â \r\n \r\nFACTS\r\nIn a prior action, Shelly sued Carolina Air Services, Inc., and Appellants, its sole shareholders, for damages arising out of work performed on her airplane.Â  While this action was pending, most of Carolina Airâ€™s assets were sold to Powerâ€™s Aviation, Inc., a separate corporate entity.Â  Although other corporate debts were paid from the gross proceeds of this sale, no funds were withheld for Shellyâ€™s possible judgment.Â  Instead, the remaining proceeds, between $200,000 and $400,000, were distributed to Appellants as shareholders.Â Â  \r\n \r\nThe circuit court subsequently awarded Shelly almost $43,000 against Carolina Air.[1]Â  By that point, Carolina Air was merely an empty corporate shell and did not pay the judgment.Â  Shelly then brought a second suit against Carolina Air and Appellants alleging fraudulent conveyance,[2] civil conspiracy, and facts warranting a piercing of the corporate veil.Â  As part of discovery, Shellyâ€™s attorney deposed Lemmond.Â  During the deposition, he inquired about the disposition of the proceeds Lemmond received from the sale of Carolina Airâ€™s assets, as well as his current assets and liabilities.Â  Lemmondâ€™s attorney objected to this inquiry and filed a motion for a protective order to preclude its discovery.Â  Dolber joined in the motion, which the trial court granted based on a determination that it was not relevant or likely to be admissible evidence at trial.Â  In order to quell Shellyâ€™s concerns regarding the availability of the proceeds, the trial court also enjoined Appellants, in the same order, from disposing of the proceeds other than in their normal course of business, investment activities, and for living expenses.Â  This appeal followed.Â \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe decision to grant injunctive relief is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 601, 553 S.E.2d 110, 121 (2001).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs where the trial court is controlled by an error of law or where the trial court's order is based on factual conclusions without evidentiary support.â€Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants contend the trial court abused its discretion in granting injunctive relief to Shelly because the court did not comply with the requirements for issuing injunctive relief.Â  Specifically, they argue:Â  (1) the parties did not receive notice and an opportunity to be heard as required by Rule 65(a), SCRCP; (2) Shelly did not allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action for injunctive relief; (3) no evidence existed to show Shelly would be irreparably harmed or damaged if the court did not issue an injunction; and (4) the trial court failed to comply with Rule 65(c), SCRCP, by not requiring Shelly to post security.Â \r\n \r\nWe find Appellants did not preserve these issues for our review.Â  â€œA contemporaneous objection is required to preserve an issue for appellate review.â€Â  \r\nHawkins v. Pathology Assocs. of Greenville, P.A., 330 S.C. 92, 111, 498 S.E.2d 395, 406 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  â€œThis principle underlies the long-established preservation requirement that the losing party generally must both present his issues and arguments to the lower court and obtain a ruling before an appellate court will review those issues and arguments.â€Â  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000).Â  \r\n \r\nAt the hearing on Appellantsâ€™ motion for a protective order, Shellyâ€™s counsel raised concerns regarding the proceeds from the sale of Carolina Air, stating â€œtheyâ€™ve done this one time before . . . and I donâ€™t want the assets to be gone before I have a chance to collect my judgment.â€Â  In response, Appellantsâ€™ attorney, not Shellyâ€™s, first suggested some kind of injunctive action:Â \r\n \r\n\r\n\tThey just - - I mean, I can tell your honor they - - theyâ€™ve suffered significantly from stock market travails, as have many others.Â  They - - They - - You know, they face someÂ  - - some - - some financial challenges; but I mean, Iâ€™d be willing - - I think that they would be willing to consent perhaps to an order that they not give away assetsÂ  . . . I mean, they need to run their personal lives, be able to pay bills and that sort of thing.Â  I donâ€™t think they have any interest whatsoever in - - in, you know, taking assets and - - and trying to hide them in some fashion.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe trial court then asked Appellantsâ€™ counsel to draft an order barring any inquiry into Appellantsâ€™ assets, but stating they were not allowed to dispose or transfer any of the proceeds except in the normal course of their business and personal lives.Â  Appellantsâ€™ attorney agreed, but asked the court, if his clients did not agree to the injunction, whether it would suffice for them to merely answer Shellyâ€™s questions. The court responded in the negative.Â  \r\n \r\nAppellants never objected to this order, nor did they file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to have it altered or amended.Â  Instead, Appellants waited almost nine months until the first scheduled day of trial to raise exception to the injunctive relief.Â  The issue was raised with a bevy of other issues, including a motion to have Shellyâ€™s counsel relieved due to the possibility he may be a witness in the case.Â  Following her counselâ€™s voluntary withdrawal, the circuit court granted Shelly a continuance to hire a new attorney, which is where the case stands today.Â  The court never addressed Appellantsâ€™ objections concerning the injunctive relief.\r\nâ€œ[A] great number of reported cases in South Carolina for at least four generations, and more recently the appellate court rules and rules of civil procedure, have emphasized the importance and absolute necessity of ensuring that all issues and arguments are presented to the lower court for its consideration.â€Â  Elam v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 23, 602 S.E.2d 772, 779 (2004).Â  At the initial hearing, Appellants failed to object to the injunctive relief or present any argument as to why it was improper.Â  If Appellants were convinced that the order went beyond the courtâ€™s injunctive authority, as they claim on appeal, then they were required to raise their arguments to the circuit court in a motion to alter or amend the injunctive order, which they also failed to do.Â  See \r\nNess v. Eckerd Corp., 350 S.C. 399, 403-04, 566 S.E.2d 193, 196 (Ct. App. 2002) (â€œIf a trial judge grants relief not previously contemplated or presented to the trial court, the aggrieved party must move, pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to alter or amend the judgment in order to preserve the issue for appeal.â€).Â  Even if we were to find that the arguments presented over nine months later sufficiently raised Appellantsâ€™ issues, they were never acknowledged, much less ruled upon, by the circuit court and, again, no Rule 59(e) motion was filed.Â  Accordingly, the issues are not preserved for our review and we do not address them here.Â  See Iâ€™On, 338 S.C. at 422, 526 S.E.2d at 724 (â€œIf the losing party has raised an issue in the lower court, but the court fails to rule upon it, the party must file a motion to alter or amend the judgment in order to preserve the issue for appellate review.â€).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause we find Appellantsâ€™ issues are not preserved for our review, the circuit courtâ€™s order is\r\n \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The circuit court did not find Appellants personally liable to Shelly in the initial action.\r\n[2] The trial court subsequently dismissed the action for fraudulent conveyance.Â Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-207","title":"Walker v.

Goldsmith, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Ellen Lindsey appeals the Master-in-Equityâ€™s decision awarding ownership of certain property to Carol Jenkins pursuant to an adverse possession claim.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nPlat Book 26 in the Anderson County Clerk of Courtâ€™s Office[1] describes, inter alia, four adjoining residential lots, designated lots 6, 7, 8, and 9.Â  Carol Jenkins is the record owner of lots 8 and 9.Â  George Walker was the record owner of lot 7, situated, as one would imagine, between lots 6 and 8.Â  Ellen Lindsey was the record owner of lot 6.\r\nIn 1965, Jenkins and her husband purchased lots 8 and 9, as well as an abandoned and dilapidated structure that they believed was situated on those lots. Around December 1967, they moved into a home that Mr. Jenkins built from the remains of the preexisting structure. Unbeknownst to the Jenkins at the time it was erected, the home is actually situated entirely within the boundaries of lots 6 and 7, and not the lots they purchased. Jenkins has occupied the residence continuously since moving in.\r\n \r\nAfter a survey revealed Jenkinsâ€™s home was situated on his lot, George Walker brought suit in 2001, seeking to establish title to lot 7 and damages for Jenkinsâ€™s encroachment.Â  Ellen Lindsey, owner of lot 6, filed a cross-complaint alleging Jenkins also encroached upon her land and should pay for diminution in the value of her property.Â  Jenkins answered by a letter to the court indicating she was willing to trade her lot 9 for Walkerâ€™s lot 7, but that she was not willing to be relocated from the home she has lived for over twenty years.\r\nThroughout her testimony at trial, Jenkins expressed her belief that she owned the land upon which her residence was situated.Â  She asserted that she believed the property was properly mortgaged and that she paid taxes on the lots.Â  She reiterated that the lots were hers and claimed ownership through adverse possession.\r\nThe master concluded Jenkins established all the requisite elements of adverse possession.Â  As to the element of hostility, the master specifically found her claim concerned the possession of both lots in their entirety and was not a mere boundary dispute.Â  Accordingly, he determined that even if Jenkins had a mistaken belief regarding her ownership of lot 6 and 7, she could still set forth a claim of adverse possession.Â  This appeal followed.[2]Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe determination of title to real estate is legal in nature.Â  Wigfall v. Fobbs, 295 S.C. 59, 60, 367 S.E.2d 156, 157 (1988); Clark v. Hargrave, 323 S.C. 84, 87, 473 S.E.2d 474, 476 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Likewise, an adverse possession claim is an action at law.Â  Miller v. Leaird, 307 S.C. 56, 61, 413 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1992).Â  In an action at law, â€œthe appellate courtâ€™s review is limited to the correction of any error of law; it must affirm the masterâ€™s factual findings unless there is no evidence that reasonably supports those findings.â€Â  Clark, 323 S.C. at 87, 473 S.E.2d at 476 (citing Jefferies v. Phillips Constr. Co., 316 S.C. 523, 451 S.E.2d 21 (Ct. App. 1994)).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nLindsey contends the master erred in finding the case was not a boundary dispute.Â  Lindsey argues the controversy actually amounts to a mere disagreement between adjacent landowners regarding the location of their shared property line; thus, Jenkinsâ€™s mistaken belief that she owned the lots does not satisfy the requirement that her possession was hostile.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn South Carolina, adverse possession is established under a ten-year statutory period.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-67-210 (2005). â€œTo constitute adverse possession, the possession must be continuous, hostile, open, actual, notorious and exclusive for the entire ten year statutory period.â€Â  Davis v. Monteith, 289 S.C. 176, 180, 345 S.E.2d 724, 726 (1986) (emphasis added).Â  Hostile possession has been defined as possession â€œwith the intention to dispossess the owner.â€Â  Lynch v. Lynch, 236 S.C. 612, 623, 115 S.E.2d 301, 306 (1960).\r\nIn interpreting this hostility requirement, South Carolina has adopted a minority position regarding mistaken belief of ownership as a basis for adverse possession.Â  Lusk v. Callaham, 287 S.C. 459, 461, 339 S.E.2d 156, 158 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  In controversies involving a disputed boundary line between adjacent properties, our courts have held that an encroachment onto a portion of anotherâ€™s land under a mistaken belief as to the location of the true boundary line does not constitute hostile possession.Â  See Brown v. Clemens, 287 S.C. 328, 331, 338 S.E.2d 338, 339 (1985); Lynch, 236 S.C. at 623, 115 S.E.2d 301, 306-307.Â  In other words, â€œwhere one . . . in the possession of land up to a supposed line intends to claim only to the true line, his possession is not hostile and will not ripen into title.â€Â  Lynch, 236 S.C. at 623, 115 S.E.2d 301, 307. \r\n \r\nThis minority interpretation of the hostility requirement, however, has been expressly limited to only those cases involving mere boundary disputes.Â  See Perry v. Heirs at Law &amp; Distributees of Gadson, 316 S.C. 224, 226, 449 S.E.2d 250, 251 (1994); Wigfall, 295 S.C. at 61-62, 367 S.E.2d at 157; Clark, 323 S.C. at 89, 473 S.E.2d at 477-478.Â  The rule that a mistaken belief of ownership fails to establish the element of hostility does not apply to cases involving a dispute over an entire tract of land.Â  Id.Â  Because no other element of adverse possession is in contention, the present case hinges on the masterâ€™s determination that Jenkinsâ€™s claim involved both parcels in their entirety and is not a mere boundary dispute between adjacent land owners.\r\nAs found by the master, we conclude the instant case does not involve a boundary dispute or a structure that merely encroaches onto a portion of a neighboring lot.Â  Jenkinsâ€™s home is entirely contained within lots 6 and 7. She has openly maintained the lots and utilized the entire property as if it were her own.Â  The evidence indicates that the portion of the lots not containing the house was cleared or had obvious landscaping that was regularly maintained by Jenkins.Â  Accordingly, the master properly concluded this case was not a boundary dispute, but was instead a claim to the entire tracts of land designated as lots 6 and 7.Â  Jenkinsâ€™s mistaken belief regarding her ownership of the lots, therefore, satisfies the hostility element of adverse possession.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause the record is replete with evidence supporting the masterâ€™s conclusion that Jenkins satisfied the elements of adverse possession for the entire ten-year statutory period, the masterâ€™s decision is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Page 176.\r\n[2] George Walker passed away in early 2003, and his estate then pursued his claim.Â  Because the estate has not filed an appeal, Jenkins has obtained possession of lot 7 by virtue of adverse possession.Â  Lindsey brings this appeal solely in regard to whether Jenkins has properly obtained possession of lot 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-208","title":"State v.

Dryer, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Katheen Jennings appeals an order by the trial judge denying her request for relief from judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b), SCRCP.Â  We affirm.[1]  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn October of 2000, Linda Lundstrom, Inc. (Lundstrom), filed suit against Kathleen Jennings, doing business as The Southern Cottage at the Falls, Inc. (Southern Cottage), seeking payment for merchandise delivered to Jennings.Â  Jennings filed an answer denying Lundstromâ€™s allegations and asserting a counterclaim for repayment and costs associated with returned merchandise.Â  According to Lundstrom, it served requests for admission on Jennings on February 14, 2001, for which it did not receive a timely response.Â  Subsequently, Lundstrom filed a motion to strike Jenningsâ€™ answer and a motion for summary judgment.Â  Jennings retained counsel and filed a motion to dismiss claiming Southern Cottage, a South Carolina Corporation, not Jennings, placed the orders in question with Lundstrom.Â  In addition, Southern Cottage filed a motion to intervene in the matter, and Jennings filed a motion to amend her answer to include these arguments as a defense.Â Â  \r\nThe trial judge issued an order on October 16, 2001, deeming Lundstromâ€™s requests for admission admitted and granting Lundstromâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  Jennings filed a motion to reconsider, arguing the trial judge should have recused himself.Â  In Jenningsâ€™ memorandum in support of her motion, she stated she asked her attorney to file a motion requesting the judge to recuse himself, but her attorney did not.Â  In addition, Jennings argued Lundstrom failed to provide her with sufficient discovery responses and she was not the correct defendant to be sued.Â  In an order signed on November 6, 2001, the trial judge denied Jenningsâ€™ motion to reconsider.Â  Jennings did not file an appeal.Â  \r\nOn January 8, 2002, Jennings filed a renewed motion to reconsider, to vacate the judgment, and to have the trial judge recused.Â  In an order dated January 9, 2002, the trial judge again denied Jenningsâ€™ requests for reconsideration and for recusal, but the judge allowed her to proceed with a motion to vacate the judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b), SCRCP.Â  Jennings filed another motion, entitled â€œAmended Renewed Motion for Reconsideration, Motion to Vacate Judgment, Motion to Recuse, and Motion for Leave to Withdraw Admissions and Memorandum in Support.â€Â  This motion was treated as a Rule 60(b) motion to vacate.Â  Jennings argued in the motion that she did not receive Lundstromâ€™s requests for admission until after it filed its motion to strike and its motion for summary judgment.Â  The trial judge conducted a hearing on the Rule 60(b) motion and subsequently issued an order dated February 22, 2002, denying Jenningsâ€™ request.Â  The trial judge determined he addressed, in his previous order, Jenningsâ€™ arguments that she was not the correct defendant and that she was due credits for returned merchandise.Â  In addition, the trial judge reasoned Jenningsâ€™ argument that she did not receive the requests for admission was without merit because the rule regarding requests for admission does not require certified mailing and Jennings did not previously assert this argument.Â  Jennings appealed the denial of her motion to vacate.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhether to grant or deny a motion under Rule 60(b) lies within the sound discretion of the judge.Â  Our standard of review, therefore, is limited to determining whether there was an abuse of discretion.â€Â \r\nRaby Constr., L.L.P. v. Orr, 358 S.C. 10, 17-18, 594 S.E.2d 478, 482 (2004) (citation omitted).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion arises where the trial judge was controlled by an error of law or where his order is based on factual conclusions that are without evidentiary support.â€Â \r\nTri-County Ice &amp; Fuel Co. v. Palmetto Ice Co., 303 S.C. 237, 242, 399 S.E.2d 779, 782 (1990).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Withdrawal or Amendment of Requests for\r\nAdmission\r\nJennings argues the trial judge erred in failing to allow her to withdraw or amend her requests for admission.Â  We disagree.\r\nWe find this issue not properly preserved for our review on appeal.Â  An issue must be ruled upon by the trial judge or raised by way of a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion to be preserved for appellate review.Â \r\nNoisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991).Â  Although Jennings asserted this argument in her Rule 60(b) motion, the trial judgeâ€™s order does not specifically address this issue.Â  In addition, Jennings did not assert this argument in a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion to alter or amend the trial judgeâ€™s order denying her request for relief from judgment.Â  Because Jennings raises the issue regarding the withdrawal or amendment of her requests for admission for the first time in her Rule 60(b) motion, we find this issue not preserved for our review.Â  \r\nII.Â  Individual Liability for Corporate Debts \r\nJennings maintains the trial judge erred in entering summary judgment against her for liabilities incurred by Southern Cottage.Â  Specifically, Jennings contends that Southern Cottage is a registered corporation in South Carolina and this corporation, not Jennings, placed the order for the merchandise for which Lundstrom seeks payment.Â  Therefore, Jennings argues absent an assertion that Southern Cottage, as a corporate entity, should be disregarded, she, as a shareholder, cannot be held personally liable for its obligations.Â Â  \r\nWithout addressing the merits of Jenningsâ€™ argument, we find her presentment of this argument in a Rule 60(b), SCRCP motion for relief from judgment improper.Â  â€œRelief from judgment under Rule 60 should not be considered a substitute for appeal from a final judgment, particularly when it is clear the party seeking relief could have litigated at trial and on appeal the claims he now makes by motion.â€Â \r\nSmith Co. of Greenville, Inc. v. Hayes, 311 S.C. 358, 359, 428 S.E.2d 900, 902 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\nJennings raised this argument before the trial judge in both her amended answer and her motion to dismiss prior to the trial judgeâ€™s order granting Lundstrom summary judgment.Â  Although the trial judge did not specifically rule on this issue in his order granting summary judgment, Jennings asserted this argument in both of her Rule 59(e), SCRCP motions, which the trial judge denied.Â  Jennings, however, did not subsequently appeal either of the trial judgeâ€™s orders denying her motions to reconsider.Â  Instead, Jennings filed a Rule 60(b) motion, which is not a substitute for an appeal.Â  Therefore, we find Jenningsâ€™ assertion of this issue pursuant to a Rule 60(b) motion improper.\r\nIII.Â  Rule 60(b) Motion \r\nJennings argues the trial judge erred in denying her request for relief from the order granting Lundstrom summary judgment.Â  Jennings presents two arguments in support of her request for relief from judgment.Â  First, Jennings asserts the trial judge based his order upon the mistaken belief that Lundstrom delivered requests for admission to Jennings prior to the due date for such requests.Â  Second, Jenningsâ€™ failure to answer Lundstromâ€™s requests constituted excusable neglect because Jennings should not be required to timely answer requests for admission she did not receive.Â  In addition, Jennings contends she has several meritorious defenses she can assert should the court grant her motion.Â  \r\nâ€œThe movant in a Rule 60(b) motion has the burden of presenting evidence proving the facts essential to entitle him to relief.â€Â \r\nBowers v. Bowers, 304 S.C. 65, 67, 403 S.E.2d 127, 129 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  Rule 60(b) provides in pertinent part: \r\n\r\n(b) Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly Discovered Evidence; Fraud, etc. Â On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:\r\n    \r\n  (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; . . . .\r\n\r\nâ€œIn determining whether to grant a motion under Rule 60(b), the trial judge should consider: (1) the promptness with which relief is sought, (2) the reasons for the failure to act promptly, (3) the existence of a meritorious defense, and (4) the prejudice to the other party.â€Â \r\nMictronics, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, 345 S.C. 506, 510-11, 548 S.E.2d 223, 226 (Ct. App. 2001). \r\nIn the present case, Jennings seeks relief from a judgment based upon requests to admit which were deemed admitted.Â  The South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provide that unless a party served requests to admit answers and denies the request within thirty days, the matters in the requests are deemed admitted.Â  Rule 36(a), SCRCP.Â  The rule further provides that matters admitted pursuant to the rule are conclusively established unless a withdrawal or amendment of the admission is allowed by the trial judge.Â  Rule 36(b),\r\nSCRCP.\r\nWe find the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Jenningsâ€™ request for relief from judgment because Jennings did not meet her burden of proving any mistake or excusable neglect.Â  The record indicates Jennings knew she did not timely answer Lundstromâ€™s requests for admission before the trial judge granted summary judgment to Lundstrom.Â  Jennings admitted in an affidavit that she learned of the requests to admit when she received Lundstromâ€™s motion for summary judgment based upon Jenningsâ€™ failure to answer the requests to admit on April 9, 2001.Â  Nevertheless, Jennings still failed to answer the requests to admit until August 15, 2001.Â  In a letter to counsel for Lundstrom, dated August 15, 2001, Jenningsâ€™ counsel wrote: â€œEnclosed is the Defendantâ€™s Answers to Plaintiffâ€™s Request for Admissions and Verification.Â  I apologize for the delay in sending the answers to you.â€Â  The trial judge addressed this failure in the order granting Lundstromâ€™s motion for summary judgment, stating:Â  â€œThe Court is first required to address Plaintiffâ€™s (earlier) Motion; Plaintiffâ€™s Request to Admit are deemed admitted, and this Court need inquire no further; the Plaintiff is entitled to the relief of Summary Judgment.â€Â Â  \r\nThe record does not contain any indication that Jennings filed a motion to withdraw the deemed admissions or to amend the deemed admissions.Â  In fact, in Jenningsâ€™ subsequent motions to reconsider, she does not assert any error by the trial judge in regard to this issue.Â  Because Jennings failed to answer the requests to admit within thirty days of service, the matters contained therein were deemed admitted pursuant to Rule 36, SCRCP.Â  Accordingly, the trial judge correctly granted summary judgment to Lundstrom.Â  Therefore, there was no evidence of mistake or excusable neglect and we find the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Jenningsâ€™ request for relief from judgment.\r\n\r\n    IV.Â  Recusal \r\nJennings argues the trial judge erred in refusing to recuse himself from the case due to a negative and hostile relationship with her.Â  \r\nWe find this issue not preserved for our review.Â  In order for an issue to be preserved for appellate review, with few exceptions, it must be raised and ruled upon by the trial judge.Â \r\nLucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505, 511, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004).Â  When a trial judge does not address the specific argument raised by the an appellant and the appellant does not make a motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to obtain a ruling on the argument, the appellate court cannot consider the argument on appeal.Â \r\nNoisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991).Â  \r\nIn the case at bar, Jennings argued this issue in her motion for relief from judgment, but the trial judge did not rule upon this issue in his order.Â  In addition, Jennings did not file a motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP to attempt to obtain a ruling on this issue.Â  Therefore, we find this argument not preserved for our review.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find Jenningsâ€™ arguments that the trial judge erred in refusing to allow her to withdraw or amend her requests for admission and in refusing to recuse himself from this action not preserved for our review.Â  In addition, Jenningsâ€™ claim that she cannot be held personally liable for obligations incurred by Southern Cottage is not properly before this court in this appeal from the trial judgeâ€™s denial of request for relief from judgment.Â  Finally, we find the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Jenningsâ€™ request for relief from judgment.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the trial judge is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nANDERSON, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-210","title":"Sladek v.

Gibbons, of Chester, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Audrey Lauren Sladek[1] (â€œDaughterâ€) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal of her accounting action against her father, Gerard R. Sladek (â€œFatherâ€), pursuant to Rule 12(b)(8), SCRCP.Â  We affirm. [2]\r\nFACTS\r\nDaughterâ€™s parents, Deborah Sharp\r\n(â€œMotherâ€) and Father, divorced in 1991.&nbsp; Pursuant to the divorce\r\ndecree, Mother retained custody of Daughter and Father agreed to pay child support and establish a trust for Daughter, to be used in part for her college education, consisting of funds from the sale of certain real property.Â  The order required Father to give Mother a full accounting of the trust every six months.Â  Daughter was emancipated by age in 1998.Â  \r\nIn 2001, Mother filed a contempt action in the family court against Father, alleging that he failed to set up the trust for Daughter, he commingled Daughterâ€™s funds with his own, and he failed to provide an accounting or access to records.Â  On September 9, 2002, while Motherâ€™s contempt action was still pending, Daughter filed a separate action in circuit court against Father seeking an accounting of the funds in her trust, alleging breach of fiduciary duty and conversion, and seeking actual and punitive damages.[3]Â  Daughter believed that Father had misappropriated between $50,000 and $92,000 from her trust.Â  Father moved to dismiss Daughterâ€™s accounting action pursuant to â€œapplicable cases and statutes including but not limited to Rule 12(b)(8),â€ because the issue was still pending in family court.Â Â Â  \r\nOn February 20, 2003, the family court issued an order in Motherâ€™s contempt action finding Father had misused Daughterâ€™s funds in violation of the divorce decree.Â  The family court found Father had inappropriately commingled Daughterâ€™s funds with his own funds and applied Daughterâ€™s funds to his own obligations.Â  The evidence presented to the family court showed that Father inappropriately deducted child support payments from Daughterâ€™s funds and inappropriately purchased a car for Daughter from the funds.Â  The family court found that the evidence was insufficient to establish the sums of any other funds which may have been misappropriated.Â  Finally, the family court found Father in contempt and sentenced him to twelve months in jail, suspended upon the repayment of $9,750 in funds used to pay the child support obligation and $8,000 deducted from the fund to purchase Daughter a car.Â  The court awarded Mother partial attorneyâ€™s fees.Â Â Â Â  \r\nOn July 30, 2003, the circuit court issued an order granting Fatherâ€™s motion to dismiss Daughterâ€™s accounting action.Â  The circuit court found Motherâ€™s contempt action and Daughterâ€™s accounting action had essentially the same parties, dealt with the same exact issues, and even had the same attorneys.Â  The court found that Daughter was the real party at interest in Motherâ€™s contempt action and noted that because the two actions dealt with the same matters, the order from Motherâ€™s contempt action barred Daughterâ€™s accounting action under the doctrines of both res judicata and collateral estoppel.Â  Thus, the court dismissed the action with prejudice pursuant to Rule 12(b)(8), SCRCP.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nUpon review of dismissal of a cause of action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(8), SCRCP, the appellate court applies the same standard of review as that implemented by the trial court.Â  In determining whether the trial court properly granted the motion to dismiss because another action with the same parties for the same claim was pending, we must consider whether the subsequent complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, states any new claim.Â  If the parties and the claims are the same in both pending actions, dismissal is appropriate.Â  Rule 12(b)(8) should be read in conjunction with Rules 8 and 10, SCRCP. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDaughter argues the circuit court erred in dismissing her accounting action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(8), SCRCP, because strict compliance with the rule is required, the named parties in the two cases were different, and there were different claims.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nA party may move to dismiss an action where â€œanother action is pending between the same parties for the same claim.â€Â  Rule 12(b)(8), SCRCP.Â  Although our courts have not directly ruled on whether the same exact named parties and the same exact claims be present to trigger the rule, the circuit court in this case found that Daughter was the real party at interest in Motherâ€™s contempt action.Â  Daughter does not appeal the circuit courtâ€™s finding that she was the real party at interest in Motherâ€™s contempt action; she merely argues that the named parties in the two actions were different.Â  Therefore, the circuit courtâ€™s finding that Daughter was the real party at interest in the family court matter is the law of the case.Â  ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 327 S.C. 238, 241, 489 S.E.2d 470, 472 (1997) (holding that an unappealed ruling is the law of the case).Â  Thus, the fact that the parties named in the captions of the two lawsuits are different in the present action is of no consequence as Daughter was the real party at interest in both actions.Â  \r\nDaughter also argues that Rule 12(b)(8) was inapplicable because the claims brought in the two actions were different.Â  Both actions sought an accounting from Father to explain how money earmarked for Daughterâ€™s trust was spent.Â  Both actions also sought the return of the money mismanaged.Â  Daughter additionally requested punitive damages for conversion in her accounting action.Â  The gist of Motherâ€™s contempt action was that Father inappropriately managed, or converted, Daughterâ€™s funds for his personal use.Â  Thus, although Daughter could not obtain the relief of punitive damages in the family court matter, the claims in both matters were the same.Â  See Plum Creek Dev. Co. v. City of Conway, 334 S.C. 30, 35, 512 S.E.2d 106, 109 (1999) (noting that the fact that different remedies were sought in a subsequent action did not alter the fact that the claims from both actions arose from the same exact factual basis and were identical). \r\nFinally, we note that whether Rule 12(b)(8) was appropriately followed in this matter is of no consequence because the circuit court dismissed Daughterâ€™s accounting action based upon alternate grounds.Â  Despite the fact that the order cites Rule 12(b)(8) as the reason for the dismissal of Daughterâ€™s action, the court actually found the action was barred based upon the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel.[4]Â  \r\nâ€œUnder the doctrine of res judicata, â€˜[a] litigant is barred from raising any issues which were adjudicated in the former suit and any issues which might have been raised in the former suit.â€™â€Â  Plum Creek Dev. Co., 334 S.C. at 35, 512 S.E.2d at 109 (quotingÂ  Hilton Head Ctr. of South Carolina, Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n of South Carolina, 294 S.C. 9, 11, 362 S.E.2d 176, 177 (1987)).Â  â€œTo establish res judicata, the defendant must prove the following three elements: (1) identity of the parties; (2) identity of the subject matter; and (3) adjudication of the issue in the former suit.â€Â  Id.Â  Thus, a subsequent action between the same parties for the same claim will be barred by a judgment on the merits in a prior action pursuant to res\r\njudicata. \r\nThe doctrine of collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, provides that issues finally determined on the merits in one action precludes relitigation of those issues in a subsequent action based on different claims between the same parties or their privies.Â  See Carrigg v. Cannon, 347 S.C. 75, 79-80, 552 S.E.2d 767, 770 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€˜â€œUnder the doctrine of collateral estoppel, once a final judgment on the merits has been reached in a prior claim, the relitigation of those issues actually and necessarily litigated and determined in the first suit are precluded as to the parties and their privies in any subsequent action based upon a different claim.â€â€™); see also Shelton v. Oscar Mayer Foods Corp., 325 S.C. 248, 251, 481 S.E.2d 706, 708 (1997) (noting collateral estoppel prevents a party from â€œrelitigating in a subsequent suit an issue actually and necessarily litigated and determined in a prior actionâ€). \r\nIn both Motherâ€™s contempt action and Daughterâ€™s accounting action, Daughter was the real party at interest and Father was the defendant.Â  Both actions raised the claim that Father misappropriated funds from Daughterâ€™s trust account and demanded an accounting.[5]Â  A final ruling was issued from the family court that Father had misappropriated funds from Daughterâ€™s trust account.Â  Because the same parties were involved, both actions concerned the same claim, and a final ruling was issued on the merits in the family court matter, the circuit court correctly found Daughterâ€™s accounting action was barred by the doctrine of res\r\njudicata.\r\nFurther, the circuit court was correct in finding Daughterâ€™s accounting action was barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel.Â  Assuming Daughterâ€™s claim for conversion could be considered a different claim, the issue of whether Father inappropriately used Daughterâ€™s trust funds was necessarily decided in the prior family court action.Â  Although the family court found the evidence supported a finding that some of the funds had been mismanaged, the issue of Fatherâ€™s mismanagement has been conclusively proven and Daughter does not get a second attempt to prove a higher amount.Â  \r\nAccordingly, because Daughter was the real party at interest in both actions, both actions dealt with the claim of Fatherâ€™s impropriety in managing Daughterâ€™s trust, and the matter was finally determined in the family court, the circuit court appropriately dismissed Daughterâ€™s accounting action.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s dismissal is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  It appears that Audrey Lauren Sladek married during the pendency of this appeal, and she is now known as Audrey Sladek McCarson.\r\n[2] Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n[3]Â  The same attorney representing Mother in the contempt action represented Daughter in the accounting action and, initially, represented Daughter in this appeal.Â  Daughter now represents herself in this appeal.\r\n[4]Â  We note that Rule 12(b)(8) appears to apply only to pending matters.Â  Here, Father filed the motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(8) when, as the rule requires, another action concerning the same parties and matter was pending in the family court.Â  At the time of the hearing on the motion, the family court matter was no longer pending and a final ruling on the matter was issued.Â  However, Daughter does not raise this argument in her appeal and we decline to address it.Â  \r\n[5]Â  We note that the record does not indicate whether the time periods involved in both actions are the same; however, Daughterâ€™s action was filed at least a year after Motherâ€™s contempt action.Â  Fatherâ€™s actions in managing the trust after the family courtâ€™s decision would present a different claim.Â  However, it is incumbent upon Daughter, as the appellant, to provide this court with a sufficient record upon which to make a decision.Â  Harkins v. Greenville County, 340 S.C. 606, 616, 533 S.E.2d 886, 891 (2000).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-211","title":"Brown v.

Coggins, Jr., David H. Tyner and Harrison, White, Smith, all of Spartanburg, for Appellant.\r\nAlbert V. Smith, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Liâ€™l Cricket Food Stores, Inc. (Store) appeals from the trial courtâ€™s judgment in favor of Donald J. Brown for $3500 on his claim for false imprisonment.Â  We reverse.[1]  \r\nFACTS\r\nBrown is a former employee of the Store.Â  This matter arose after Eddie Morman, the manager, discovered on October 6, 1999 that $500 was missing from a deposit that was left overnight in his desk drawer.Â  After a search revealed that the money was indeed missing, corporate management told Morman to call the police and have them fill out a report.Â  \r\nOn October 9, 1999, an officer from the Spartanburg County Sheriffâ€™s Department filled out an incident report and took a voluntary statement from Morman.Â  In the statement, Morman indicated he had informed his superiors that only three employees had access to the money:Â  Brown, Sara Strong, and himself.Â  Brown and Strong were listed as suspects on the incident report.Â  \r\nThe Store also conducted an in-house investigation.Â  Corporate management watched videotape from the security cameras and noticed that on several occasions Brown allowed customers to leave the store with beer and cigarettes without paying for them.Â  This information was turned over to Wayne Butler, head of security for the Store. \r\nOn October 18, 1999, Butler and other corporate management officers interviewed Brown, Morman and Strong separately.Â  All three denied any knowledge of the moneyâ€™s whereabouts.Â  Brown testified Butler told him during that conversation that â€œif [Brown] didnâ€™t tell [Butler] that [Brown] took the money, [Brown] was going to jail.â€Â  Brown responded that they â€œmight as well go ahead and get a warrant on [him] because [Brown] knew [he] didnâ€™t take the money.â€Â  Another employee, Pamela Rice, asked to speak to the corporate management officers.Â  Rice told management she had seen Brown take money and put it into his pocket on one occasion.Â  Additionally, Rice said she had seen Brown allow customers to leave the store without paying for beer and cigarettes.Â  Rice gave a written statement relating the same information.Â  \r\nBecause the videotape corroborated what Rice said, corporate management questioned Brown about the beer and cigarettes, and he admitted giving them to friends of his.Â  The Store suspended Brown from employment because of the video evidence of him giving away store merchandise.Â  \r\nAfter completing the interviews, Butler turned the results of the Storeâ€™s investigation, including Riceâ€™s statement, over to the police.Â  Corporate management and the investigating officer both testified that no accusations were made against Brown at that time.Â  Butler testified he never suggested to police that Brown be arrested.Â  Additionally, Brown admitted he never heard either Morman or Butler make any accusations against him to the police.Â  \r\nOn October 22, 1999, Officer John Hudson presented the results of the police investigation to a magistrate and obtained an arrest warrant for breach of trust under $1,000.Â  Officer Hudson testified that it was departmental policy for officers to request a warrant once the investigation was concluded to determine whether probable cause existed.Â  Officer Hudson further testified that Butler had no part in the decision to seek a warrant.Â  \r\nBrown was subsequently arrested pursuant to the warrant.Â  He spent approximately eight hours in jail.Â  A trial date was set, and notice of a hearing was mailed to the Store.Â  Butler testified that as there is no mail receptacle at the Store, any mail addressed to that location would be returned.Â  In addition, Butler was out of the office for about a month during this time for medical reasons.Â  No one from the Store appeared at the hearing.Â  As a result, the charges against Brown were dismissed.Â  \r\nBrown then brought an action against the Store for false imprisonment and liable per se, seeking actual and punitive damages.Â  The Store asserted a counterclaim pursuant to the South Carolina Frivolous Proceedings Sanctions Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-10 through -50 (2005).Â  After a bench trial, the trial court found in favor of the Store on the libel per se action but in favor of Brown on the false imprisonment claim and the Storeâ€™s counterclaim.Â  The court awarded Brown $3,500 in damages.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis is an action at law.Â  See Culler v. Blue Ridge Elec. Co-op., Inc., 309 S.C. 243, 246, 422 S.E.2d 91, 93 (1992) (stating an action in tort is generally an action at law).Â  â€œIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.â€Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Store argues that the circuit court erred as a matter of law in finding that its actions constituted false imprisonment.Â  We agree. \r\nâ€œFalse imprisonment is â€˜deprivation of a personâ€™s liberty without justification.â€™â€Â  Gist v. Berkeley County Sheriffâ€™s Depâ€™t, 336 S.C. 611, 615, 521 S.E.2d 163, 165 (Ct. App. 1999) (quoting Caldwell v. K-mart Corp., 306 S.C. 27, 30, 410 S.E.2d 21, 23 (Ct. App. 1991)).Â  â€œIn order to prevail on a claim for false imprisonment, the plaintiff must establish:Â  (1) the defendant restrained the plaintiff, (2) the restraint was intentional, and (3) the restraint was unlawful.â€Â  Id. at 618-19, 521 S.E.2d at 167.Â  \r\nA private party at whose request, direction, or command a police officer makes an unlawful arrest may be liable for false imprisonment 32 Am. Jur. 2d False Imprisonment Â§ 40 (1995); see, e.g., Wingate v. Postal Tel. &amp; Cable Co., 204 S.C. 520, 30 S.E.2d 307 (1944) (holding a company liable for false arrest based on conduct by one of its employees).Â  Although it is not necessary that the defendant expressly direct the arrest, â€œthere must be some affirmative act on the defendantâ€™s part which induces the officer to make the arrest.â€Â  32 Am. Jur. 2d False Imprisonment Â§ 41 (1995).Â  The instigation must be such that the arrest is not carried out by the officerâ€™s own volition, but to carry out the request of the third party.Â  Id.Â  â€œAlso, no liability is incurred if a person merely gives information to an officer tending to show that a crime has been committed; this is so even if the information purports to show that the person later falsely arrested is the one who committed the alleged crime.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe supreme court in Wingate elucidated:\r\n\r\nWhere a person merely directs the attention of a police officer to what he supposes to be a breach of the peace, or gives to such officer facts indicating such, and the officer, without other direction, arrests the offender on his own responsibility, the person who did nothing more than communicate the facts to the officer is not liable for causing the arrest, even though it is made without a warrant.Â  Where a person has information or knowledge that the law has been violated, he not only has a right, but frequently it is his duty, to communicate such information or facts to the proper officer so as to give such officer the opportunity, if in his judgment it is proper to do so, to take whatever steps may be necessary to apprehend the offender. . . . Those who honestly seek the enforcement of the law and who are supported by circumstances sufficiently strong to warrant a cautious man in the belief that the party suspected may be guilty of the offense charged, should not be made unduly apprehensive that they will be held answerable in damages.\r\nBut it is equally well settled that where a private person induces an officer by request, direction or command to unlawfully arrest another, he is liable for false imprisonment.Â  The charge of false imprisonment is not confined to the party who unlawfully seizes or restrains another, but it likewise extends to any person who may cause, instigate or procure an unlawful arrest.\r\n\r\nWingate, 204 S.C. at 527-28, 30 S.E.2d at 310-11 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Â \r\nIn Wingate, an employee of the defendant company went to police, complained of the suspectsâ€™ actions, and told the officer that â€œthey ought to be arrested.â€Â  Wingate, 204 S.C. at 524, 30 S.E.2d at 309.Â  The court held that a jury question was created as to liability.Â  Id. at 28, 30 S.E.2d at 311. \r\nHere, there is no indication in the record that the Store or any of its agents requested, directed, or commanded Brownâ€™s arrest.Â  Mormanâ€™s statement did not specifically accuse Brown.Â  Morman listed three people with access to the area where the money had been, including himself.Â  The police report named both Brown and Strong as suspects.Â  \r\nThe in-house investigation was conducted on October 18, 1999, over a week after police took the statement.Â  After interviewing Strong, Morman and Brown, and taking Riceâ€™s voluntary statement, corporate management turned the information over to the police because it was part of an ongoing criminal investigation.Â  The only evidence regarding an accusation was Brownâ€™s testimony that Butler, the head of security, accused him of taking the money.Â  However, this accusation was not made in the presence of law enforcement.Â  The investigating officersâ€™ testimony at trial corroborated the testimony of the Storeâ€™s employees, who uniformly testified that the results of their investigation were turned over to law enforcement without comment.Â  Officer Hudson denied any employee of the Store accused Brown of taking the money.Â  Finally, Officer Hudson testified that departmental policy required the results of the investigation to be presented to the magistrate for a warrant once it was completed.Â  He further testified that Butler â€œwas in no position to request [a warrant] whatsoever.â€Â  \r\nWe find no evidence in the record supporting a finding that the Store or any of its agents communicated any accusation against Brown to the police.Â  Brown failed to show an inducement by request, direction, or command to unlawfully arrest him.Â  Accordingly, we hold that Brownâ€™s false imprisonment claim fails as a matter of law.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the order of the trial court is hereby \r\n REVERSED. Â \r\n GOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1]We decide this case without oral argument pursuant toÂ  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-212","title":"Craddock v.

Guess, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-212\r\nSubmitted March 1, 2005 â€“ Filed March 24, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nWilliam E. Whitney, Jr., of Union, for Appellant.\r\nGeorgeÂ  Brandt, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this domestic action, Michael Glenn Craddock (â€œHusbandâ€) appeals a family courtâ€™s award of alimony and retirement benefits to Denise Craddock (â€œWifeâ€).Â  We affirm. [1]\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife married on March 31, 1972.Â  The couple parented two children, both having reached the age of majority by the time this action commenced.Â  Throughout the marriage, Husband worked for Norfolk Southern Railroad where he accumulated certain retirement benefits.Â  The parties purchased a home in Union County in 1988 and resided there together as husband and wife until they separated.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nOn January 14, 2002, Wife commenced this action by filing a â€œPetition for Decree of Separate Maintenance.â€Â  In her petition, Wife sought, inter alia, the marital residence, alimony, and a division of marital property.Â  Wife asserted the couple separated on November 19, 2001.Â  In his answer and counterclaim, Husband contested Wifeâ€™s claim to the marital home and disputed the date of separation.Â  Husband alleged the parties separated on January 15, 2000, and lived separate and apart continuously since that time.Â  Therefore, Husband asserted he was entitled to a divorce on the ground of one yearâ€™s continuous separation.Â  Wife filed an answer to Husbandâ€™s counterclaim reaffirming the date of separation put forward in her pleadings.\r\nA hearing on the merits was held on January 27, 2003.Â  At the beginning of the proceedings, Wife moved to amend her pleadings to request a divorce on the ground of one yearâ€™s continuous separation.Â  The trial court granted the request without objection from Husband.Â  On June 25, 2003, the court issued an order granting a divorce to Wife.Â  \r\nRelying partially on the testimony presented as well as general agreement among the parties, the court found Wife earned approximately $2,000.00 a month, while Husband earned $5,655.00 per month.Â  Based on this finding, the court awarded Wife alimony in the amount of $1,075.00 a month.Â  In addition, using a property division of 50 percent, the court apportioned the marital property, including funds that accumulated in Husbandâ€™s retirement account during the marriage.Â  Specifically, the court awarded Wife the marital residence, half of the proceeds in the partiesâ€™ bank account, and a portion of the Husbandâ€™s retirement benefits.\r\nHusbandâ€™s retirement benefits with Norfolk Southern Railroad are divided into two categories â€“ Tier I and Tier II.Â  The distribution amounts of Tier I benefits are controlled by federal law and cannot be altered by a state court order.Â  Under Tier I, a divorced spouse meeting certain requirements will automatically receive benefits.Â  Tier II is not as strictly regulated and may be subject to equitable distribution.Â  \r\nThe court determined it would take a period of 40 years for Husbandâ€™s retirement benefits to fully vest.Â  Because the parties were married for 30 years, or 75 percent of the time it would take for the benefits to vest, the court held Wife would be entitled one-half of 75 percent or 37.5 percent of the total Tier II benefits.[2]Â  Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has the authority to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).Â  This broad scope of review does not, however, require this court to disregard the factual findings of the family court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  Neither are we required to ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHusband first asserts the trial court erred in awarding alimony because the divorce should have been granted to him and there was no finding of fault.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe award of alimony rests within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.â€Â  Jenkins v. Jenkins, 357 S.C. 354, 358, 592 S.E.2d 637, 639 (Ct. App. 2004) (citation omitted).Â  A court abuses its discretion when its decision is controlled by some error of law or its ruling lacks evidentiary support.Â  Hailey v. Hailey, 357 S.C. 18, 23, 590 S.E.2d 495, 497 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nThere is no fixed standard as to the amount of alimony to be awarded.Â  A family court has discretion to determine the award after taking into consideration all of the relevant factors.Â  Rimer v. Rimer, 361 S.C. 521, 524, 605 S.E.2d 572, 574 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Section 20-3-130(C) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004) contains thirteen factors a court must consider, including: the duration of the marriage, the age and physical condition of both parties, their educational background, employment history, and the marital and nonmarital properties of the parties.Â  Fault is but one of the many factors a family court must consider when making such a decision.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C)(10) (Supp. 2004).Â  Because it is clear from the family courtâ€™s ruling that the appropriate factors were considered, we find Husbandâ€™s argument that Wife was not entitled to alimony because there was not a finding of fault to be without merit.Â Â  \r\nSimilarly, Husbandâ€™s argument that the trial court erred in granting alimony to Wife because he should have been granted the divorce is unconvincing.Â  For all practical purposes this argument is the equivalent of the former.Â  As noted previously, Husband petitioned the court for divorce on the non-fault ground of one yearâ€™s continuous separation.Â  Wife moved, without objection from Husband, to amend her pleadings to also include the no-fault ground.Â  It is clear from a review of the record that the court merely considered the testimony and made a factual determination that the parties separated on the date asserted by Wife.Â  Therefore, we find no error in the family courtâ€™s award of alimony to Wife.\r\nThe Husband next contends the family court erred in awarding Wife a portion of his Tier II retirement benefits.Â Â Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe apportionment of marital property is within the discretion of the family court judge and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  See Morris v. Morris, 295 S.C. 37, 39, 367 S.E.2d 24, 25 (1988).Â  South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2004) requires that the family court consider fifteen factors and give each weight as it determines.Â  On review, this court looks to the fairness of the overall apportionment, and if the end result is equitable, the fact that this court might have weighed specific factors differently than the family court is irrelevant.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300-01, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988); Doe v. Doe, 324 S.C. 492, 502, 478 S.E.2d 854, 859 (Ct. App. 1996) (the reviewing court will affirm the family court judgeâ€™s apportionment of marital property if it can be determined the judge addressed the relevant factors under section 20-7-472 with sufficiency for the reviewing court to conclude the judge was cognizant of statutory factors).\r\nSignificantly, Husband correctly admits his Tier II retirement benefits are marital property and subject to equitable distribution.Â  See e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472(8) (Supp. 2004).Â  Husband argues, however, that the family court erred in awarding Tier II benefits to Wife because she did not specifically ask for them.Â  We disagree.\r\nWife specifically asked in her pleadings for the court to grant her an order â€œequitably dividing the real and personal property accumulated by the parties during the course of the marriage.â€Â  The parties also stipulated to the admission of a statement of Husbandâ€™s retirement benefits.Â  Thus, having already found that Husbandâ€™s Tier II benefits constitute marital property, we find the trial court properly considered the stipulated documents and made an appropriate award based on Wifeâ€™s request.Â  \r\nIn this case, the overall distribution was 50 percent.Â  We find, given the statutory factors, that this distribution is fair and equitable.Â  Given the length of the marriage, the value of the marital property, and the incomes of both parties, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in its distribution of the marital property, including Husbandâ€™s Tier II retirement benefits.Â  In identifying, valuing, and apportioning the property, the family court relied upon the testimony and stipulations from both parties.Â  After examination of both the partiesâ€™ testimony and the fifteen statutory factors listed in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472, it is clear the family court divided the marital property in a fair manner.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] In its final order, the family court rounded Wifeâ€™s award up to 38 percent.Â  Although Husband mentions this in his appeal, he does not specifically take exception to it, and thus, it has become the law of the case.Â  Tolerâ€™s Cove Homeowners Assâ€™n, Inc. v. Trident Constr. Co., 355 S.C. 605, 610, 586 S.E.2d 581, 584 (2003) (holding unappealed portion of judgment becomes the law of the case).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-213","title":"State v.

Byrholdt,Â  of Anderson, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott,\r\nAssistant Attorney General David A. Spencer, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Robert M. Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: John Thomas E., Jr. appeals from his adjudication of delinquency, arguing the family court failed to direct a verdict of acquittal on two charges of auto breaking and two counts of petit larceny.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn February 20, 2001, a bus driver called the Clemson University campus police to report a suspicious vehicle in one of the University parking lots.Â  The driver observed the vehicle, a white Ford Explorer, on row four of a residential parking lot at 12:45 a.m.Â  Approximately five minutes later, the Explorer was idling on row ten of the lot, but its lights had been turned off. Thinking the occupants in the vehicle might need a ride to another campus location, the bus driver stopped in an adjacent row and opened the bus door.Â  Once the door opened, the driver of the Explorer turned on the lights, drove in reverse down row ten, and turned out of the parking lot. \r\nCampus police officers, who were responding to the bus driverâ€™s call, saw the Explorer exiting another campus parking lot.Â  One officer, Officer Smith, stopped the vehicle, and explained to the driver what had been reported.Â  Smith further explained that numerous cars had recently been broken into while parked in campus lots, and in an effort to â€œclear this up very quickly,â€ asked if he could search the vehicle.Â  The driver consented to a search.\r\nTo conduct the search, Officer Smith asked the other two occupants in the Explorer to step out of the vehicle.Â  Appellant John Thomas was the front seat passenger. \r\nInside the vehicle, Officer Smith found two car radios and numerous tools lying on the floor in the back seat.Â  In the front of the car, he found a â€œwindow busting toolâ€ and miscellaneous car parts on the floor in front of the passengerâ€™s seat. \r\nAs Officer Smith searched the vehicle, two other officers who were on the scene separated the occupants of the vehicle.Â  Appellant requested to speak with Officer Smith.Â  Upon this request, he was brought to Officer Smithâ€™s car, where he made a statement. \r\nIn this statement, Appellant admitted to sneaking out of his house and driving to Wal-Mart with his two friends.Â  He claimed they were going to the Wal-Mart parking lot to play with a remote control car.Â  Because the remote control car broke, they left Wal-Mart and went to the Clemson parking lots where his friends broke into a number of vehicles.Â  Appellant then rode with Officer Smith and pointed out three vehicles in three different lots that had been broken into.Â  \r\nWhile riding with Officer Smith, Appellant continued to talk about the events of that evening.Â  Appellant explained that he was playing with his remote control car in a University parking lot when he heard a crash and then saw his friend running towards him with a car radio under his shirt.Â  At some point during the car ride with Officer Smith, Appellant also claimed that his friends had dropped him off at a store for approximately forty-five minutes while they stole a moped and went joyriding.Â  His friends then picked him back up, and all three proceeded to a strip mall parking lot where his friends broke into several cars.Â  After doing that, they proceeded to the campus parking lots.\r\nOfficer Smith testified that Appellant explained to him that he needed to be in a parking lot to play with his remote control car because the car was very fast and he needed an open area.Â  Both Officer Smith and the bus driver testified that the lots in which cars were broken into were quite full while other lots nearby were virtually empty.\r\nAfter the State presented its case against Appellant, defense counsel moved for a directed verdict, arguing Appellant was merely present at the crime scene and there was no evidence he had participated in any crime.Â  The family court denied the motion.Â  The defense rested its case without presenting any witnesses, and counsel renewed his motion for directed verdict, which was again denied. \r\nThe family court adjudicated Appellant delinquent, finding beyond a reasonable doubt he was guilty under the doctrine of â€œthe hand of one is the hand of all.â€Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred by failing to direct a verdict of acquittal on all four charges he faced.Â  Specifically, Appellant claims the State failed to prove â€œany overt act by [him] to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt . . .under a theory of the hand of one is the hand of all.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nIn reviewing the refusal to grant a directed verdict in a criminal case, the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the State to determine whether there is any direct or substantial circumstantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused, or from which guilt may be fairly and logically deduced.Â  State v. Pinckney, 339 S.C. 346, 349, 529 S.E.2d 526, 527 (2000).Â  The court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.Â  State v. Mitchell, 341 S.C. 406, 409, 535 S.E.2d 126, 127 (2000).Â  \r\nâ€œUnder the â€˜hand of one is the hand of allâ€™ theory, one who joins with another to accomplish an illegal purpose is liable criminally for everything done by his confederate incidental to the execution of the common design or purpose.â€ State v. Condrey, 349 S.C. 184, 194, 562 S.E.2d 320, 324 (Ct. App. 2002). \r\nViewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we find there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to deny the motion for a directed verdict.Â  A â€œwindow busting toolâ€ was found on the floor in front of the seat in which Appellant was riding when the Explorer was stopped by campus police.Â  Furthermore, Appellantâ€™s story about playing with his remote control car while his friends broke into cars was suspect considering he had told the officer that his remote control car had become broken in the Wal-Mart parking lot and considering the testimony of the bus driver who saw the Explorer inching its way around a parking lot as if the occupants were carefully choosing which cars to break into.Â  Furthermore, if Appellant were merely playing with his remote control car, there would be no reason to move from one parking lot to another, especially when each of those lots were nearly full with parked cars and other nearby lots were empty.Â  Appellantâ€™s ability to directly lead Officer Smith to each vehicle also suggests he was actively involved in the crime spree.\r\nAll of the foregoing is substantial circumstantial evidence supporting the Stateâ€™s theory that Appellant and his friends shared a common intent to break into vehicles when they drove to three different parking lots at Clemson University with a â€œwindow busting toolâ€ in their vehicle.Â  Therefore, we find no error in the family courtâ€™s denial of Appellantâ€™s motion for a directed verdict.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the family courtâ€™s finding of delinquency is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-215","title":"Hardin v.

Hardin (Husband) appeals from the final order of the family court awarding JoAnn C. Hardin (Wife) one-half of the partiesâ€™ retirement accounts, alimony in the amount of $400 per month, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe parties married in 1984 and separated in 1993.Â  While still married to Wife, Husband entered a â€œceremonial marriageâ€ with defendant Cheryl Watts.Â  Wife filed an action in 2001, seeking a divorce on the grounds of adultery, alimony, equitable division of the marital property, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Watts was named a defendant due to her joint ownership with Husband of property, which Wife sought to have declared marital property.Â  \r\nThe family court granted Wife a divorce on the ground of adultery.Â  The court determined the partiesâ€™ retirement accounts were the only marital property to be divided.Â  The court divided the accounts equally, with Wife retaining her account and being entitled to a share of Husbandâ€™s larger account.Â  Wife was awarded $400 in alimony and $3,500 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  Nor must we ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Miles v. Miles, 355 S.C. 511, 516, 586 S.E.2d 136, 139 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEquitable Division of Retirement Accounts\r\nHusband contends the family court erred in awarding Wife over $16,000 in Husbandâ€™s retirement funds because the parties were separated for over ten years.Â  Additionally, he contends the family court failed to properly consider the fifteen relevant factors for equitably dividing the partiesâ€™ marital property.Â  We disagree. \r\nFirst, we note these issues may not be preserved for appellate review.Â  While Husband contested the equitable division during trial, he never specifically raised the issue of the family courtâ€™s failure to consider the fifteen factors under section 20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004) or Wifeâ€™s lack of contribution to the retirement accounts.Â  After receiving the order, he was required to raise the issues before the family court in a motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rules 52 and 59, SCRCP.Â  See Bakala v. Bakala, 352 S.C. 612, 625, 576 S.E.2d 156, 163 (2003) (finding issue raised for the first time on appeal is not preserved for review by appellate court when it could have been raised by a Rule 59(e) motion).\r\nAdditionally, the claim fails on its merits.Â  The family courtâ€™s order specifically stated:Â  â€œ[t]hat due to the length of the marriage . . . being over nineteen (19) years, the marital property should be divided equally.Â  All assets . . . were acquired during the partiesâ€™ marriage and both parties made contributions, either directly or indirectly, to their accumulation.â€Â  Additionally, the court noted the considerations â€œgoverning equitable apportionment of property are governed by S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-471, et seq (1985).â€Â  These considerations would include the factors listed under section 20-7-472.Â  In this regard, we reject Husbandâ€™s invitation to concentrate on the factor of his direct contributions to the exclusion of the other statutory factors.\r\nFinally, based on our independent review of the record, we find the family court acted well within its discretion in equally dividing the partiesâ€™ retirement accounts.Â  This was a nineteen-year marriage.Â  Even though the parties were separated for a number of years, â€œa marriage is not terminated as of the date the parties separate . . . .â€Â  Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 184, 554 S.E.2d 421, 425 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The family court is statutorily mandated to identify and value the marital estate â€œas of the date of commencement of marital litigation.â€Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§20-7-473 (Supp. 2004); Shannon v. Shannon, 301 S.C. 107, 111, 390 S.E.2d 380, 382-83 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  Thus, even if this issue were preserved for review, the equitable division established by the family court is appropriate and is affirmed.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Alimony\r\nHusband asserts the family court erred in calculating the financial needs of Wife and in awarding her $400 in alimony.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn award of alimony rests within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 282, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002).Â  â€œAlimony is a substitute for the support which is normally incident to the marital relationship.â€Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  The family court judge may grant alimony in an amount and for a term as the judge considers appropriate under the circumstances.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(A) (Supp. 2004).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFactors considered in making an alimony award include:Â  (1) duration of the marriage; (2) physical and emotional health of the parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4) employment history and earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living established during the marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the parties; (7) current and reasonably anticipated expenses of the parties; (8) marital and nonmarital properties of the parties; (9) custody of children; (10) marital misconduct or fault; (11) tax consequences; and (12) prior support obligations; and (13) other factors the court considers relevant.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2004).Â  No one factor is dispositive.Â  Lide v. Lide, 277 S.C. 155, 157, 283 S.E.2d 832, 833 (1981).Â  While it is preferable for the trial court to discuss all relevant factors, we may still affirm if we can discern from the record that the trial court properly considered all appropriate statutory factors.Â  See Doe v. Doe, 319 S.C. 151, 156, 459 S.E.2d 892, 895 (Ct. App. 1995).\r\nThe family court specifically enumerated the factors for making an award of alimony.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130 (Supp. 2004).Â  In its findings, the court focused on the greater income earned by Husband compared to Wifeâ€™s income.Â  Additionally, Wifeâ€™s health impacts her current and future earnings.Â  Finally, the court calculated that Wife had a deficit of approximately $300 per month after subtracting her expenses from her income.\r\nHusband contends the calculation was in error because it included a period of time in which Wife did not work.Â  However, while her income may have been higher if she had worked during the entire period, it was clear from the testimony that her health will continue to impact her ability to earn to her maximum potential.Â  Wife also testified $22,687 was the most she ever made and that was with working overtime.Â  Her financial declaration shows almost $22,000 in income.Â  We find the amount listed on her financial declaration and the amount used by the court in its calculations are supported by the evidence in the record.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding Wife $400 per month in alimony, and the award is affirmed.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nHusband maintains the family court erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife because the equitable division should be reversed and because a portion of the litigation involved Watts.Â  We disagree.\r\nAttorneyâ€™s fees may be assessed against a party in an action brought in the family court.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(38) (Supp. 2004).Â  â€œAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge and should not be disturbed on appeal unless there is an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 533, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004).Â  In determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the court should consider each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fee, the beneficial results obtained by the attorney, the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions, and the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).\r\nThe trial court specifically found the award of attorneyâ€™s fees was proper because of Husbandâ€™s adulterous conduct, his greater ability to pay compared to Wife, and the beneficial results obtained by Wife.Â  Based upon the record, we agree with the findings of the family court.Â  \r\nHusband points to Sexton v. Sexton, 310 S.C. 501, 503, 427 S.E.2d 665, 666 (1993), in which the South Carolina Supreme Court found an award of attorneyâ€™s fees â€œshould be reduced by the amount of hourly fees incurred in litigating . . . an issue litigated solely between Wife and a third party.â€Â  However, while Watts was named as a party, the record reveals her involvement was minor during the course of trial.Â  Watts was named because she, along with Husband, owned an interest in property in which Wife sought a determination of whether it was marital property. The issue was not litigated solely between Wife and a third party, but was based upon Husbandâ€™s ownership of the property.Â  Additionally, Husband failed to demonstrate the inclusion of Watts in the litigation increased the fee incurred by Wife.Â  In any event, the joinder of Watts was necessitated by Husbandâ€™s purported marriage to Watts.Â  We affirm the family courtâ€™s award of $3,500 in attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe decision of the family court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-216","title":"Hiott v.

Cleveland, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nJack M. Scoville, Jr., of Georgetown, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Margaret R. Hiott appeals from an order of the master-in-equity denying her claim for breach of a contract to sell real property, in which the master held Hiott failed to deliver marketable title.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn March 3, 1999, Hiott entered into a contract with Gerald and Elizabeth Kelly for the sale of her residence on Pawleys Island.Â  Closing was to take place on April 26, 1999.Â  The sale price was $728,000.Â  The contract did not expressly provide that time was of the essence.Â  The Kellys provided $25,000 in earnest money, which was held in an escrow account.\r\nThis dispute arose when a title search revealed a handwritten notation by the Georgetown County Clerk of Court in the grantor index indicating that a 1976 deed in Hiottâ€™s chain of title was of no legal effect.Â  The notation referenced case number 78-CP-22-356, a quiet title action concerning a dispute over ownership of certain property located at Magnolia Beach, a tract of land opposite Pawleys Island.Â  In that action, referred to as the Bultman action, title to the disputed property had been confirmed in plaintiffs W.F. Bultman and Anna Birnie McDonald against defendants Arthur L. Barber, Jr. and James A. Wilder and others.Â  \r\nOn April 20, 1999, counsel for the Kellys notified Hiottâ€™s closing attorney of the title issue.Â  The Kellysâ€™ counsel opined that the notations in the index rendered the subject property unmarketable.Â  Hiottâ€™s closing attorney referred the matter to an attorney who had represented Hiott in the past.Â  On April 23, the new attorney wrote to the Kellysâ€™ counsel reassuring them that title was marketable and that he was prepared to issue an ownerâ€™s title insurance on the property.Â  Closing did not occur as scheduled on April 26.Â  On April 27, Hiottâ€™s counsel wrote to the clerk of court requesting she review the Bultman file and remove the notation from the deed in Hiottâ€™s chain of title.Â  The next day, the Kellysâ€™ counsel wrote back, raising a number of title concerns.Â  He noted the clerkâ€™s office had made a decision to not remove the notation from the index.Â  The letter concluded by opining that title to the property was not marketable and the Kellys were unwilling to close.Â  He informed Hiottâ€™s counsel that he would be out of town from April 28 until May 3. \r\nThat same day, Hiottâ€™s counsel responded, again taking the position that title to the property was marketable.Â  In the letter, he stated that he was considering the Kellysâ€™ letter of that date as demonstrating an intent to rescind the contract.Â  He warned that if closing did not occur by May 3, he would advise Hiott to â€œresell the property at the Kellyâ€™s risk.â€ However, he also suggested they â€œexplore some reasonable logical solution to this problem[.]â€\r\nOn May 5, the clerk of court told Hiottâ€™s counsel in a telephone conversation that the notations would be removed and followed up with a confirmation letter the next day.Â  Hiottâ€™s counsel immediately notified the Kellysâ€™ counsel.Â  The Kellys, however, refused to close as they were no longer interested in the property.Â  At that time, the Kellys had not obligated themselves to purchase any other property.Â  Hiott subsequently sold the property for $675,000. \r\nHiott then brought an action seeking damages for breach of contract.Â  The case was referred by consent order to the master-in-equity.Â  The master issued a decree finding that Hiott had failed to deliver marketable title, that the removal of the notations by the clerk of court was insufficient to make the title marketable, and that, in any case, the problem was not corrected within a reasonable time.Â  Hiott filed a timely motion to alter or amend.Â  After hearing the matter, the master issued an amended decree finding only that the notation on the grantor index made the title unmarketable and thus the Kellys did not breach the contract.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action seeking money damages for breach of a land sale contract is an action at law.Â  Sanders v. Coastal Capital Ventures, Inc., 296 S.C. 132, 134, 370 S.E.2d 903, 905 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  In an action at law tried by a master alone, our scope of review is limited to correction of errors of law, and we will affirm the masterâ€™s factual findings unless there is no evidence reasonably supporting them.Â  Crary v. Djebelli, 329 S.C. 385, 388, 496 S.E.2d 21, 23 (1998).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe primary issue on appeal is whether the master correctly found that title to the property was unmarketable.Â  The question of whether a title is marketable is one of law for the court to determine.Â  77 Am. Jur. 2d Vendor and Purchaser Â§ 137 (2004).Â  â€œIt is axiomatic that a purchaser cannot be required to take a doubtful title.â€Â  Sales Intâ€™l Ltd. v. Black River Farms, Inc., 270 S.C. 391, 398, 242 S.E.2d 432, 435 (1978).Â  However, â€œ[t]o be marketable, a title need not be flawless.â€Â  Gibbs v. G.K.H., Inc., 311 S.C. 103, 105, 427 S.E.2d 701, 702 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  Instead, title is marketable if it is â€œfree from encumbrances and any reasonable doubt to its validity.Â  It is a title which a reasonable purchaser, well-informed as to the facts and their legal significance, is ready and willing to accept.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œThe mere, bare possibility, or remote probabilities, that there may be litigation with respect to the title is not sufficient to render it unmarketable.Â  There must be a reasonable probability of litigation.â€Â  Sales Intâ€™l, 270 S.C. at 398, 242 S.E.2d at 435 (quoting 57 A.L.R. 1253, 1307-08 (1928)).Â  \r\nThe Kellys challenge marketability by asserting that the facts of the Bultman case and the notations in the grantorâ€™s index produced a sufficient cloud on Hiottâ€™s title to render it unmarketable.Â  \r\nThe Bultman action involved a title dispute over property known as Magnolia Beach.Â  W.F. Bultman, Anna Birnie McDonald, and Bultmanâ€™s father purchased the disputed property at a partition sale.Â  The partition deed, dated May 4, 1960, described the subject property as follows:\r\n\r\nALL that tract or parcel of land situate in Township No. 7, County of Georgetown, State of South Carolina, known as Magnolia Beach, constituting a part of Midway Seashore Plantation, containing twenty (20) acres, more or less, bounded on the Northeast by lands of Dr. Henry Norris; Southeast by the Atlantic Ocean, Southwest by a creek separating said Magnolia Beach from Pawleyâ€™s Island; Northwest by lands of Birnie, Bultman and others; and being more fully shown on a plat made by Lawson Oliver, C.E., dated October 30, 1934, as containing 28.8 acres of property, together with 12.5 acres subject to overflow.Â  \r\n\r\nThis description identifies property lying east of the inlet, between the inlet and the beach.Â  The complaint in Bultman quoted this description in identifying the property to which the plaintiffs sought to quiet title.Â  The supreme court also quoted this description in its opinion.Â  Bultman v. Barber, 277 S.C. 5, 8, 281 S.E.2d 791, 793 (1981).\r\nJames A. Wilder and Arthur L. Barber purchased three tracts of property from Donald McKenzie in 1976.Â  In their answer, Wilder and Barber asserted paramount title by referencing all three transactions.Â  Of these three deeds, only one of them involved the disputed area east of Midway inlet known as Magnolia Beach.Â  Wilder and Barber had subdivided their Magnolia Beach property and conveyed some of the lots to others who were made parties to the Bultman case.Â  The other two properties lay west of the inlet.Â  Those properties had already been conveyed to R.S. Cole and Bernice T. Cole, who were not made parties to the Bultman lawsuit, when the action was commenced.Â  Hiottâ€™s title derives from the Coles.Â  \r\nAfter the trial court granted a directed verdict in favor of Bultman and the other plaintiffs, the supreme court affirmed, finding that the interests of Wilder and Barberâ€™s predecessors in title had been cut off by the partition sale.Â  Bultman, at 9-10, 281 S.E.2d at 794.Â  Upon remand, the trial court issued an order providing that the â€œplaintiffs herein are the owner of all that portion of Magnolia Beach claimed by defendants herein; and the titles thereto held by defendants are of no legal effect and that the records in the office of the Clerk of Court of Georgetown County shall be adjusted to so indicate.â€Â  Counsel for the Bultman plaintiffs wrote the clerk of court requesting that the notation be made regarding a tract of land recorded in â€œDeed Book 144 at page 136â€ and â€œother deeds to the same land executed by defendants.â€Â  (Emphasis added).Â  Although this letter referenced only the property recorded in Deed Book 144 at page 136, the clerk of court noted that all three 1976 deeds transferring property from McKenzie to Wilder and Barber were of no legal effect in the grantor index.[1]\r\nThere is no question that the Bultman action did not involve Hiottâ€™s property and the notation on the grantor index was made in error.Â  The Kellysâ€™ counsel admitted this fact at oral argument.Â  The complaint in Bultman referenced only property east of the inlet.Â  Moreover, the partition deed on which the entire litigation was based contained the same description.Â  Wilder and Barberâ€™s answer did mention the other deeds they received from McKenzie in 1976, but they did not include a counterclaim to put the validity of those deeds at issue.Â  The supreme courtâ€™s opinion and the trial courtâ€™s subsequent order only mention the Magnolia Beach property.Â  Finally, the letter from counsel for the Bultman plaintiffs to the clerk of court contained no reference to Hiottâ€™s property.Â  That letter requested adjustment of the record to reflect the invalidation of the deed recorded in â€œDeed Book 144 at Page 136,â€ the property east of the inlet. Although the letter also requested similar adjustments pertaining to â€œother deeds to the same land executed by defendants,â€ this language clearly refers to the subsequent purchasers of the Magnolia Beach property, who were made parties to the litigation.Â  Therefore, the notations entered concerning the other deeds executed by McKenzie, who was not a defendant, to Wilder and Barber were clearly erroneous.Â  \r\nFurthermore, Hiottâ€™s chain of title could not have been affected by the Bultman action because at the time the litigation was commenced, Hiottâ€™s property had already been conveyed to the Coles, who were not made parties to that case.Â  \r\nWe find that a subsequent, erroneous notation in the index of a properly recorded and indexed deed, without more, is insufficient to render title unmarketable.Â  Where, as here, the purchasers could have determined the notations were erroneous by a careful reading of the property descriptions in the referenced case, and the pertinent facts and documents were called to their attention and discussed prior to the closing, the purchasers should not be able to rescind the contract merely by pointing to a technical defect not created by the seller.Â  Allowing rescission under such circumstances would place an undue hardship on sellers, who would be forced to bring quiet title actions to resolve minor defects.Â  \r\nFurthermore, at the very latest, title to Hiottâ€™s title was marketable when the clerk of court corrected the notation in the index.Â  The Kellys assert that the removal of the notation by the clerk of court did not remove the cloud on Hiottâ€™s title because such removal was unauthorized as it was not done with court approval.Â  The clerk of court originally made the notations at the request of the plaintiffâ€™s attorney in Bultman.Â  The request for removal by Hiottâ€™s attorney Moran did not seek to countermand the order of the court in Bultman.Â  It merely pointed out that the notations did not comply with the courtâ€™s order in that case.Â  After considering that matter, the clerk of court agreed and removed the notations.Â  It was merely the clerk of court correcting a prior mistake by the clerk of court. The clerk of court by statute is granted certain discretion in maintaining the record.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-9-30 (Supp. 2004).Â  Thus, there was no need for further court action.Â  \r\nThe Kellys further argue that even if the removal of the notation cured the marketability problem, it was not done within a reasonable time.Â  The contract did not provide that time was of the essence.Â  â€œIt is well established in this state that time is not of the essence of a contract to convey land unless made so by its terms expressly or by implication.â€Â  Faulkner v. Millar, 319 S.C. 216, 219, 460 S.E.2d 378, 380 (1995).Â  â€œWhen the contract does not include a provision that â€˜time is of the essence,â€™ the law implies that it is to be done within a reasonable time.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nHiottâ€™s counsel clearly made every effort to alleviate the problem with the notation on the index within a reasonable time.Â  Hiott was not informed of the problem until April 20, six days before closing.Â  In the flurry of communications over the next several days, Hiott reassured the Kellys that title was marketable, obtained title insurance for the property, explained that the Bultman case had no bearing on the title, and offered to make all her counselâ€™s title notes available to counsel for the Kellys.Â  When the Kellys refused to close, Hiottâ€™s counsel wrote the clerk of court the next day, requesting that the erroneous notations be removed.Â  Although the clerk of court initially refused to remove the notation, Hiottâ€™s counsel persisted and the notations were removed on May 5.Â  Additionally, counsel for the Kellys was out of town for several days during this period.Â  \r\nThe Kellys assert that the letter from Hiottâ€™s counsel dated April 28 made time of the essence by implication.Â  This letter concluded as follows:\r\n\r\nI take your letter of today as a clear and unequivocal interest to rescind the contract.Â  Mrs. Hiott stands ready, willing and able to close.Â  Given this, I hereby direct the realtors to withhold the [earnest] money.Â  I suspect that your clients do not consent to a release of this money to Mrs. Hiott.Â  If we do not close by 5:00 pm Monday, I will instruct Mrs. Hiott to resell the property at the [Kellysâ€™] risk.\r\nIf we agree, for the sake of argument, that your position is correct and title is not marketable, do you agree with me that the seller is contractually granted the right and obligation to cure the defect within a reasonable time?Â  Considering what we both know, do you disagree that a quiet title action will almost certainly be successful?Â  If the answer to both of the preceding questions is in the affirmative, is there any reason for us to explore some reasonable logical solution to this problem?Â  \r\n\r\nAlthough Hiottâ€™s counsel postured in the letter that he would advise Hiott to resell the house if closing did not occur by a certain date, he also inquired about finding a â€œreasonable solution to this problem[.]â€Â  It is apparent that with the letter Hiott was still negotiating to consummate the sale and did not intend to make time of the essence.Â  Thus, we find that as the correction to the notation was made within a reasonable time of the originally scheduled closing, the Kellys were not justified in refusing to close.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude the master erred as a matter of law in holding Hiott failed to deliver marketable title to her property.Â  Thus, the Kellys were in breach of their contract with Hiott when they refused to close.Â  We remand for a determination of damages.[2]Â  \r\n REVERSED and REMANDED. \r\n GOOLSBY, HUFF and STILWELL, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] The deeds in Hiottâ€™s chain of title were recorded in Deed Book 142 at page 800 and Deed Book 143 at page 274.\r\n[2] Hiottâ€™s complaint sought damages measured by the contract price minus the resale price, plus moving expenses and prejudgment interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-217","title":"KBR Development v.

Alexander,Â  of Pickens, for Appellants.\r\nThomas Elihue Dudley, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Clemson Hospitality Investments, LLC (CHI), Robert S. Arnold, and Roy S. Arnold (collectively â€œAppellantsâ€) appeal a jury award of $100 to KBR Development, LLC, for breach of contract and past due rent.Â  We affirm.[1]Â Â  \r\n FACTS\r\n    In October of 1999, KBR, developers of a shopping center in Clemson, South Carolina, entered into a lease agreement with YANSY Reality, Inc. and the BBQ Company, Inc.Â  The BBQ Company issued a franchise to CHI to operate a Redâ€™s Backwoods BBQ restaurant in the leased location.Â  CHI, through its members Steve Harvey, Robert Arnold, and Roy Arnold, also signed a guarantee associated with the lease between YANSY, the BBQ Company, and KBR.Â  In addition, Robert Arnold and Steve Harvey signed personal guarantees.Â  \r\n    Both the lease and the guarantee contained provisions allowing KBR to collect attorneyâ€™s fees in the event of litigation between the parties, contingent upon KBRâ€™s success in the proceedings.Â  Another provision of the lease agreement required KBR to build the structure of the building, while the BBQ Company would finance the upfitting.Â  However, the BBQ Company was unable to meet its responsibility because of financial difficulties.Â  Therefore, KBR made an agreement with CHI to upfit the restaurant, guaranteed with a promissory note by CHI in the amount of $190,000, with monthly payments of $3,500 for ten years.Â  \r\n    On January 4, 2002, KBR notified Appellants in writing that the promissory note and the lease were in default and demanded immediate payment.Â  Thereafter, in a meeting between the parties, CHI, through Robert Arnold, agreed to pay $2,500 per week until the rent and note payments were caught up, whereupon he paid $3,000 on January 16, 2002.Â  However, KBR did not receive the $2,500 from CHI the next week.Â  Pursuant to the default provisions under the lease, KBR took possession of the restaurant on January 27, 2002.Â  Upon repossession, KBR turned the restaurant equipment over to Carolina First Bank, who subsequently auctioned off the equipment to pay the secured debt owed by CHI.Â  \r\n    On February 19, 2002, KBR filed a complaint against CHI and its members, alleging breach of contract in regard to the lease agreement and the promissory note, ejectment, and collection of rent by distraint.[2]Â  Appellants counterclaimed alleging unlawful eviction, conversion, and unfair trade practices.Â  KBR motioned for summary judgment for breach of contract concerning the promissory note and the trial court granted partial summary judgment, amounting to an award of $171,738.84 to KBR.Â  The remaining issues went before a jury.Â  At the jury trial, the trial court found as a matter of law that Appellants were liable on the lease, and it directed a verdict against Appellants on their claim for unfair trade practices.Â  The jury awarded $100 to KBR for breach of the lease agreement and further found for KBR on Appellantsâ€™ counterclaims.Â  The trial court denied Appellantsâ€™ motion for reconsideration.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â  \r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS \r\n      I.Â  Partial summary judgment\r\n        Appellants claim the trial court erred in awarding partial summary judgment to KBR on its breach of contract claim based on the promissory note.Â  We disagree.\r\n        When reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, we apply the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â \r\n        â€œWhen determining if any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.â€Â  Id. at 494, 567 S.E.2d at 860.Â  â€œIf triable issues exist, those issues must go to the jury.â€Â \r\n        Nelson v. Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Comâ€™n, 362 S.C. 1, 4, 605 S.E.2d 744, 746 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\n        Appellants admit they were in default on the promissory note.Â  Appellants also admit they received written notice of default on January 4, 2002.Â  Although Appellants negotiated with KRB to make weekly payments to bring them up to date, they did not make the first $2,500 payment the week immediately following their agreement.Â Â  While the note requires 30 days notice before repossession action may be taken, Appellants were in default from November 2001 and did not attempt to make any other payments after the January 16, 2002 payment, which only partially covered the debt.[3]Â  KBR did not file a complaint to collect on the promissory note until late February 2002.Â  Therefore, KBR complied with the leaseâ€™s notice requirements.Â  \r\n        Appellantsâ€™ also argue that the value of the upfittings and improvements should be credited against the total amount owed under the note.Â  However, Appellants signed a promissory note for $190,000 and there was nothing contained in the note or the lease giving CHI credit for any of the tenant upfits upon expiration of the lease.Â  Therefore, there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding the promissory note and the trial court did not err when granting partial summary judgment for KBR on the breach of contract claim under the promissory note.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;\r\nUnlawful eviction charge\r\n            Appellants claim the trial court erred in failing to charge the jury on the law of unlawful eviction.Â  We disagree.\r\n            â€œA trial court must charge the current and correct law.â€Â  Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 311, 536 S.E.2d 408, 425 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œWhen reviewing a jury charge for alleged error, an appellate court must consider the charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œIf the charge is reasonably free from error, isolated portions, which might be misleading do not constitute reversible error.â€Â  Id.\r\n            There is no question that CHI signed and executed a guarantee agreement for the lease between KBR and YANSY and the BBQ Company.Â  Furthermore, Robert Arnold also personally guaranteed the note.Â  According to the guarantee agreement, when YANSY and the BBQ Company failed to make the lease payments, Appellants became responsible.Â  The lease provided KBR with the self-help option of repossessing the property if lease payments were overdue by fifteen days.Â  Therefore, KBR acted within their legal rights, and the trial court charged the correct law in light of the evidence presented at trial.Â Â Â  \r\n            III.Â  Conversion\r\n            Appellants claim the trial court erred in denying their motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and new trial because they were entitled to an award of damages for conversion of their restaurant equipment.Â  We disagree.\r\n            When reviewing the denial of a motion for directed verdict or JNOV, we apply the same standard as the trial court by viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Id. at 299, 536 S.E.2d at 418.Â  â€œThe trial court must deny the motions when the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.â€Â  Id. at 300, 536 S.E.2d at 418.Â  We reverse the trial court only when there is no evidence to support the ruling below.Â  Id.Â  â€œWhen considering directed verdict and JNOV motions, neither the trial court nor the appellate court has authority to decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony or evidence.â€Â  Id. at 300, 536 S.E.2d at 419.\r\n            A judge can grant a motion for JNOV only if no reasonable jury could have reached the challenged verdict.Â  Id.Â  A judge will not overturn a juryâ€™s verdict if any evidence exists that sustains the factual findings implicit in its decision.Â  Id.Â  \r\n            â€œA claim for conversion can be based on an unauthorized detention of property, after demand.â€Â  Oxford Finance Companies, Inc. v. Burgess, 303 S.C. 534, 539, 402 S.E.2d 480, 482 (1991).Â  â€œIn order to prevail in a conversion action, the plaintiff must prove either title or right to possession of the property at the time of the conversion.â€Â  Id.Â  Â \r\n            KBR was in lawful possession of the restaurant at the time it conveyed the equipment to Carolina First Bank.Â  Furthermore, KBR might have subjected itself to liability had it not recognized the collection rights of the bank.[4]Â  Therefore, there was substantial evidence for the trial court to deny a directed verdict for the Appellantsâ€™ on their counterclaim for conversion and for the jury to reach their verdict for KBR on the conversion claim.\r\n            IV.Â  Attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n            Appellants also claim the trial court erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to KBR.Â  We disagree. \r\n            Generally, the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees to be awarded is within the discretion of the trial judge.Â \r\n            Burton v. York County Sheriffâ€™s Dept., 358 S.C. 339, 357, 594 S.E.2d 888, 897 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  However, the award of fees must be reasonable and supported by adequate findings.Â  Id.\r\n            The trial court considers six factors when determining an award of attorneyâ€™s fees: (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) professional standing of counsel; (4) contingency of compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained; and (6) customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Id. at 358, 594 S.E.2d at 897.Â  If the requested attorneyâ€™s fees are authorized by contract or statute, the trial court should make specific findings of fact on the record for each of these factors.Â  Id.  \r\n            The jury found for KBR for breach of the lease and in respect to all of Appellantsâ€™ counterclaims, making KBR the prevailing party in the litigation.[5]Â  Furthermore, Appellants signed a guarantee of â€œthe lease agreements . . . in case of default by the BBQ Company.â€Â  Also, Robert Arnold executed a personal guarantee of the lease.Â Â Â  \r\n            The provisions of the lease entitled the prevailing party to recover attorneyâ€™s fees and costs associated with the litigation as follows:\r\n\r\n            In the event that at any time during the term of this Lease either Landlord or Tenant shall institute any action or proceeding against the other, then, and in that event, the unsuccessful party in such action or proceeding agrees to reimburse the successful party for the reasonable expenses of attorneyâ€™s fees and disbursements incurred therein by the successful party.\r\n\r\n            In addition, the promissory note, which the trial court issued summary judgment for, also included a provision providing attorneyâ€™s fees at 15% of the balance due in connection with the collection of the note.Â  Also, KBR requested attorneyâ€™s fees in its complaint.\r\n            The trial court thoroughly discussed the factors to be considered when awarding attorneyâ€™s fees in its order.Â  â€œBased on the pleadings in the record, the Memorandum of Law with attached exhibits submitted by [KBR],â€ which included analysis of these factors, the trial court found that an award of attorneyâ€™s fees in the amount of $23,972.75 in costs to KBR was reasonable and appropriate.Â  Furthermore, the award was substantially less than 15% of the balance due on the promissory note, which is the amount contracted to by the parties in the event of default on the note.Â  Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to\r\n            KBR.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n             AFFIRMED.\r\n            ANDERSON, BEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Steve Harvey subsequently filed bankruptcy and was discharged from the action.\r\n[3] KBR repossessed the restaurant on January 27, 2002 because Appellantsâ€™ rent was in default.Â  The lease provided that the Landlord could â€œenter upon and take possession of the Premisesâ€ if failure to pay continued â€œfor a period of fifteen (15) days.â€Â  \r\n[4] See Oxford Finance Companies, Inc. v. Burgess, 303 S.C. 534, 402 S.E.2d 480 (1991) (holding a landlord, who refused to turn over an ejected tenantâ€™s collateral to a secured lender, could be liable to lender for conversion and possible punitive damages).\r\n[5] A prevailing party is â€œone who successfully prosecutes the action or successfully defends against it, prevailing on the main issue, even though not to the extent of the original contention [and] is the one in whose favor the decision or verdict is rendered and judgment entered.â€Â  Heath v. County of Aiken, 302 S.C. 178, 182-83, 394 S.E.2d 709, 711 (1990).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-218","title":"Kirchner v.

Eslinger and Dennis J. Lynch, both of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nJ. Michael Taylor, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is an appeal from a grant of divorce to Barbara J. Kirchner (â€œWifeâ€) from Allen W. Kirchner (â€œHusbandâ€).Â  Husband appeals the family courtâ€™s decision apportioning certain portions of the marital estate, awarding alimony in the amount of $3,800 per month, admitting the testimony of Wifeâ€™s rebuttal witness, holding Husband in contempt, and awarding attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nWife and Husband, a physician, were married in February of 1985.Â  In March of 2000, after years of discord, Wife filed for a divorce based on the ground of adultery.Â  She also sought several restraining orders, alimony, equitable distribution, AIDS testing, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  In a temporary agreement reached by the parties and approved by the family court, Husband agreed to pay Wife $4,200 a month.Â  In February 2002, Husband filed a motion to reduce alimony and support obligations because he was no longer an employed member of his practice and no longer received a salary.Â  Wife filed for contempt and a rule to show cause for Husbandâ€™s failure to pay the temporary alimony and the auto insurance agreed upon in the pendente lite order.Â  \r\nPrior to the final hearing, the parties reached a settlement agreement regarding the distribution of all the marital property except for possession of the family dog, Sam.Â  The family court approved the property settlement agreement between the parties.Â  The court also granted Wife a divorce on the ground of adultery, gave possession of Sam to Wife, found Husband in contempt for failing to pay the temporary alimony, and awarded Wife permanent alimony of $3,800 per month and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Husband appeals.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has authority to find the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  We are mindful that the family court, which saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Hilton Head condominium distribution\r\nHusband claims the family court erred in equally dividing the contents of the Hilton Head condominium between the parties because the property settlement agreement, approved by the court, awarded 60 percent from the proceeds of the sale of the property to Husband and the remainder to Wife.Â  We agree.[2]\r\nLitigants in this state have consistently been encouraged by our courts to reach extra-judicial agreements on issues arising out of the marital relationship, when possible, to enhance judicial efficiency.Â  Drawdy v. Drawdy, 275 S.C. 76, 78, 268 S.E.2d 30, 31 (1980).Â  Nevertheless, the family court has the duty to determine whether any such agreement was entered into freely and voluntarily and whether it was fair.Â  Funderburk v. Funderburk, 286 S.C. 129, 131, 332 S.E.2d 205, 206 (1985).Â  Further, the family court must only determine whether the agreement is within the bounds of reasonableness from both a procedural and substantive perspective when determining if the agreement is fair.Â  The court should not determine the partiesâ€™ rights as if there had been no agreement.Â  Burnett v. Burnett, 290 S.C. 28, 30, 347 S.E.2d 908, 909 (Ct. App. 1986).\r\nThe parties submitted a property settlement agreement disposing of the entirety of their marital property with the exception of the dog, Sam.Â  The parties specifically described the nature of the agreement regarding the distribution of the Hilton Head condominium:\r\n\r\nSo far as the Hilton Head condominium is concerned, there are four sets of items that are nonmarital property of the husbandâ€™s. . . . Marital property, the husband will get the couch, the Wife will get the six-drawer white chest.Â  The rest of the furniture in the condominium is to be sold in a reasonable manner, probably through Mr. Watts or some other estate service, and the proceeds split 60 percent to the husband, 40 percent to the wife.\r\n\r\nThe court received the agreement into evidence, questioned the parties extensively about the agreement and its voluntariness, and subsequently approved it.Â  The court also made certain the parties understood that the division of the property pursuant to the settlement agreement would be final.Â  The court specifically noted during the hearing that it recognized the 60/40 division of the Hilton Head condominium.Â Â  \r\nWifeâ€™s attorney submitted a proposed order.Â  Although the court had previously approved the 60/40 property settlement agreement, the proposed order indicated that the Hilton Head property was to be divided 50/50.Â  Prior to the issuance of the order, Husbandâ€™s attorney wrote to the family court judge and indicated the proposed order did not comport with the settlement agreement of the parties.Â  Wifeâ€™s attorney, however, indicated in correspondence that after the final hearing, Husband took everything out of the Hilton Head condominium, instead of the few agreed upon items, and offered to recompense Wife by giving her 50 percent instead of the previously agreed upon 40 percent.Â  The family court approved the proposed order.Â  \r\nReviewing the evidence in the record, we find the family court erred in ordering an equal division of the Hilton Head condominium.Â  The only agreement before the court was that Husband would take certain specified items from the condominium and the parties would divide the value of it 60/40.Â  Nothing regarding a subsequent agreement was presented to the court.Â  Therefore, the courtâ€™s order regarding the division of the condominium is reversed.Â  We remand this issue for a hearing before the family court to determine whether a subsequent agreement between the parties occurred and to award the proper distribution to the parties. \r\nII. Alimony\r\nHusband claims the family court erred in awarding $3,800 per month in permanent alimony.Â  He argues the courtâ€™s findings were not supported by the record and failed to consider both partiesâ€™ reasonably anticipated income, the partiesâ€™ health, and Wifeâ€™s needs.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œAn award of alimony rests within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 184, 554 S.E.2d 421, 424 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œAlimony is a substitute for the support that is normally incident to the marital relationship.â€Â  McElveen v. McElveen, 332 S.C. 583, 599, 506 S.E.2d 1, 9 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  The purpose of alimony is to place the supported spouse in the position he or she enjoyed during the marriage.Â  Id.Â  However, alimony should not â€œserve as a disincentive for spouses to improve their employment potential or to dissuade them from providing, to the extent possible, for their own support.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nFactors to be considered in making an alimony award include:Â  (1) duration of the marriage; (2) physical and emotional health of the parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4) employment history and earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living during the marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the parties; (7) current and reasonably anticipated expenses of the parties; (8) marital and non-marital properties of the parties; (9) custody of children; (10) marital misconduct or fault; (11) tax consequences; (12) prior support obligations; and (13) other factors the court considers relevant.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2004).Â  \r\nEvidence was presented regarding the partiesâ€™ employment and health histories.Â  Wife testified that she met Husband while she was employed full-time as a registered nurse.Â  During the marriage, Wife never worked more than part-time, and she did not work at all after the early 1990â€™s.Â  She testified that she would need some amount of continuing education to go back to nursing.Â  Wife suffered from major depression, high cholesterol, and mitral valve prolapse, which she controlled with medication.Â  She was constantly fatigued and could not concentrate because of depression.Â  In fact, her psychiatrist testified that Wife â€œhad a difficult time sequencing things in order to make reasonable decisions. . . .Â  If we are talking about a high degree of ability to reason and make adequate judgments at times, that is clearly impaired in [his] observations of [Wife].â€Â  Husband submitted the testimony of a vocational expert to show that Wife was potentially employable in the nursing field, though she admittedly did not evaluate Wifeâ€™s personal situation other than contacting the South Carolina Board of Nursing.Â Â  \r\nPrior to their separation, the parties enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle, including living in the $700,000 marital home and taking several vacations a year.Â  After the separation, Wife moved to a small apartment and suffered from depression.Â  Wifeâ€™s financial declaration indicated that she incurred $3,306.54 in monthly expenses.Â  \r\nHusband was a successful physician with Aiken Obstetrics and Gynecology Associates, P.A.Â  After twenty-five years, he retired in September 2002 because a neurological disorder in his hand rendered him unable to perform surgeries.Â  However, his financial situation was strong.Â  He received a tax-free disability stipend of $7,800 per month, considerably more than his $60,000 annual salary as an office gynecologist.Â  He also received a property award in the divorce of approximately $1 million, including the marital home, and had access to an additional $800,000 in non-marital assets.Â  He admitted on cross-examination that despite his neurological deficit, he was still capable of employment as an office gynecologist.Â  Furthermore, he spent upwards of 100 hours per month volunteering as a deputy sheriff, proving he was capable of gainful employment in some capacity.Â Â  \r\nEvidence regarding Husbandâ€™s marital misconduct and ability to maintain his standard of living was also presented.Â  Husband admitted that he began an adulterous relationship with Teresa Ellis seven months before he and Wife separated.Â  He continued this relationship, and Ellis and her son moved into the former marital residence, where Husband provided Ellisâ€™ living expenses, automobile insurance, health and life insurance, and shopping expenses.Â  Ellis was also unemployed and was no longer receiving unemployment checks at the time of the final hearing.Â  After his retirement in September 2002, Husband continued to pay the mooring and the maintenance on his fatherâ€™s boat, transferred property worth $80,000 to his son for no consideration and in violation of the pendente lite order, and purchased Ellis a $1,000 mink coat and a $1,800 diamond bezel for her Rolex watch.Â  \r\nBased on the evidence presented to the family court, we find the family court adequately considered all the statutory factors, including the partiesâ€™ employment histories and Husbandâ€™s misconduct, in determining alimony.Â  Although the evidence indicated that Wife could become employable, the evidence also indicated that her lifestyle was substantially diminished by the divorce while Husbandâ€™s remained unchanged.Â  Despite Husbandâ€™s argument that alimony should be lowered because he was unemployed, the evidence indicated that Husband could substantially improve his financial status by electing to return to practice as an office gynecologist.Â  The evidence also showed that Husband had access to substantial resources and could easily pay the ordered alimony while maintaining his standard of living.Â  See McMurtrey v. McMurtrey, 272 S.C. 118, 121, 249 S.E.2d 503, 505 (1978) (noting that there is â€œno limitation that alimony payments be made solely from current earningsâ€).Â  Because the family court adequately considered the factors, we find no abuse of discretion in awarding alimony to Wife in the amount of $3,800 per month.Â Â  \r\nIII. Sam\r\nHusband claims the family court erred in awarding the dog, Sam, to Wife.Â  We disagree.\r\nFamily pets are considered personal property.Â  See Richardson v. Florida Cent. &amp; P.R. Co., 55 S.C. 334, 335, 33 S.E. 466, 466 (1899) (â€œThere is no longer any room to doubt that a dog is personal property in this State.â€).Â  The apportionment of marital property will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Bungener v. Bungener, 291 S.C. 247, 251, 353 S.E.2d 147, 150 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Section 20-7-472 lists fifteen factors for the court to consider in equitably apportioning a marital estate.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2004); Greene v. Greene, 351 S.C. 329, 340, 569 S.E.2d 393, 399 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  On appeal, this court looks to the overall fairness of the apportionment. Â Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  If the end result is equitable, it is irrelevant that the appellate court would have arrived at a different apportionment.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nThe evidence elicited at the final hearing showed that Wife purchased Sam and named him.Â  She also was the dogâ€™s primary caretaker, including taking him to his veterinary appointments.Â  Wife testified as to her extreme emotional attachment to the dog, and Wifeâ€™s daughter confirmed this testimony.Â  Furthermore, Husband recognized Wifeâ€™s ownership of the dog because he would notify her when he was taking the dog out of town with him.Â  In addition, whereas Wife had ownership of the dog upon separation, Husband seized the dog from the kennel Wife had boarded him at and had not allowed Wife access to the dog since that time.Â  Thus, there was sufficient evidence in the record that showed Sam belonged primarily to Wife.Â  Most importantly, Husband retained approximately $800,000 of non-marital assets and obtained 60 percent of the marital assets from this divorce, including the family home.Â  Therefore, we find no abuse of discretion in awarding the dog to Wife.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIV. Appropriate rebuttal witness\r\nHusband claims the family court erred in allowing Wifeâ€™s psychiatric expert to testify as a rebuttal witness to Husbandâ€™s vocational expert.Â  We disagree.\r\nWe recognize that the admission of reply testimony is within the discretion of the trial judge.Â  Vernon v. Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., 266 S.C. 208, 222, 222 S.E.2d 501, 508 (1976).Â  â€œFurther, the rules of discovery were designed to promote the full examination of all relevant facts and issues and to discourage litigants from surprising one another through the introduction of unexpected testimony.â€Â  Kramer v. Kramer, 323 S.C. 212, 217, 473 S.E.2d 846, 848 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  In order to encourage compliance with discovery rules, courts can impose sanctions upon parties who violate them, including the exclusion of witnesses whose identities have been withheld.Â  Id.Â  However, because exclusion of a witness is a severe sanction, it should only be imposed after the court inquires into:Â  â€œ(1) the type of witness involved; (2) the content of the evidence to be presented; (3) the nature of the failure to identify the witness; and (4) the degree of surprise to the other party.â€Â  Id. at 217, 473 S.E.2d at 848-49.\r\nWife testified regarding her ailments, including a heart condition, depression, anxiety, and fatigue, as well as the hurdles she would have to overcome in order to return to her former employment as a nurse.Â  During the presentation of Husbandâ€™s case, his vocational expert testified as to the employment positions available to Wife based on her educational level, experience, skills, and abilities.Â  However, the expert admitted that she did not take into consideration Wifeâ€™s mental and physical condition, though she reviewed the health records.Â  Following her deposition, the expert, who admittedly â€œhad already formulated her opinionâ€ as to Wifeâ€™s employability, reviewed Wifeâ€™s psychological and psychiatric records.Â  She then stated that â€œif [Wife] was psychologically incapable or psychiatrically incapable of doing the job of a registered nurse,â€ it may affect her employability.Â  Over Husbandâ€™s objection, Wife presented the testimony of her treating psychiatrist as an expert in reply.Â  The expert testified that Wifeâ€™s skills and abilities were limited because of her depression and mitral valve prolapse condition, thereby severely restricting her employment capabilities.Â Â  \r\nHusband argues it was error for the family court to allow Wifeâ€™s expert to testify to matters that should have been presented in her case in chief.Â  We agree that Wife broached the topic of her inability to obtain employment during her presentation of the evidence, and it would have been appropriate for her to present her expert to testify regarding her employment prospects at that time.Â  However, Husbandâ€™s expert testified regarding the general ability of someone with a nursing license to obtain employment.Â  Wife was able to present an expert to reply to this evidence by testifying about Wifeâ€™s specific abilities.Â  Although Wife did not specifically note the expert on her witness list prior to the start of trial, she obtained the expert during the six week break in the trial.Â  Further, because Wifeâ€™s expert responded to Husbandâ€™s expert in reply, we find no prejudice or surprise and, thus, the family court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the reply testimony.Â  \r\nV. Contempt\r\nHusband claims the family court erred in finding him in contempt of the pendente lite order because he was unable to pay.Â  We disagree.\r\nAlthough a determination of contempt is within the family courtâ€™s discretion, an order holding a party in contempt â€œshould be reversed when the holding is based on a finding that is without evidentiary support or when there is . . . an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Means v. Means, 277 S.C. 428, 431, 288 S.E.2d 811, 812-13 (1982).Â  To sustain a finding of contempt, the record must be clear and specific as to acts or conduct upon which the finding is based.Â  Curlee v. Howle, 277 S.C. 377, 382, 287 S.E.2d 915, 918 (1982).\r\nIf a valid court order exists, a person who is obligated to pay alimony can be held in contempt of court for not paying the required amount on time.Â  There must be a finding of willful contempt.Â  Id.Â  When the contemnor is unable to pay, he should not be held in contempt.Â  Hicks v. Hicks, 280 S.C. 378, 381, 312 S.E.2d 598, 599 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  \r\nThe temporary order memorialized the partiesâ€™ agreement whereby Husband would provide $4,200 per month in temporary alimony to Wife and pay her automobile insurance until a final order.[3]Â  Husband admitted that despite the pendente lite order, he only paid Wife $3,300 in February of 2002 and thereafter.Â  He also dropped Wife from his automobile insurance policy.Â  Husband claimed he could not afford the alimony payments because he lost his job due to illness.Â  However, Husband had access to approximately $1.8 million worth of both non-marital and marital property after the equitable division.Â  He also received $7,800 per month of nontaxable income from his disability policy.Â  Furthermore, in absolute defiance of the court order, he transferred property worth $80,000 to his son for no consideration.Â  Lastly, Husband was supporting his paramour and her son through lodging, car maintenance, credit card purchases, automobile insurance, and numerous gifts, including a mink coat and a diamond bezel for a Rolex watch.Â  The family court found Husband in contempt for purposefully reducing Wifeâ€™s alimony payments in violation of the court order because Husband â€œhad the means, but not the inclination, to obey the Order of this Court.â€Â  \r\nHusband willfully reduced Wifeâ€™s alimony prior to obtaining a new order reducing the amount of alimony.Â  Therefore, we find the family court did not abuse its discretion in holding Husband in contempt.\r\nVI. Attorneyâ€™s fees Â Â Â Â  \r\nHusband claims the family court erred in awarding Wife attorneyâ€™s fees and costs because her motion for attorneyâ€™s fees was untimely and there was no other evidence in the record to support the award.Â  We disagree.Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œThe award of attorney fees is within the discretion of the court.â€Â  Hardwick v. Hardwick, 303 S.C. 256, 261, 399 S.E.2d 791, 794 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  In determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the court should consider each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fees, the beneficial results obtained by their attorney, the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions, and the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 815 (1992).Â  Furthermore, once the court decides to award attorneyâ€™s fees, it must determine a reasonable award.Â  The court should look at several factors, including the difficulty of the case, the time involved, the professional standing of the counsel, and the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).Â  \r\nTestimony in this case was held on January 31, 2002, February 4, 2002, and March 22, 2002.Â  During trial, Wifeâ€™s attorney asked permission to submit an affidavit for attorneyâ€™s fees at the end of the case â€œso [they could] incorporate the present trial time.â€Â  Husband did not have an objection to this request to hold the record open.Â  Wife also testified as to her attorneyâ€™s retainer of $15,000 and his hourly rate of $200.00.Â  After Wife finished her case-in-chief, there was a six-week period during which she was allowed to depose one of Husbandâ€™s experts.Â  Unfortunately, the clerk of court misplaced some exhibits in the case, and the parties agreed to recreate the record after both sides concluded testimony.Â  Furthermore, the court requested the parties submit briefs addressing Husbandâ€™s request for the reduction of temporary alimony and the rule to show cause.Â Â  \r\nThe court requested that Wife draft a final order on April 29, 2002.Â  On May 6, 2002, Wifeâ€™s counsel submitted an affidavit in support of Wifeâ€™s request for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs, noting that counsel was very experienced in marital matters and had incurred $32,911.25 in the case.Â  Husband moved to strike the affidavit in support of attorneyâ€™s fees, arguing that:Â  Wife rested her case without presenting any evidence regarding attorneyâ€™s fees; Wife failed to reserve the right to present additional evidence on the matter; and Wife waived any request for fees by not addressing it in the final hearing.Â  It does not appear from the record that a hearing was ever held on Husbandâ€™s motion to strike.Â  Nevertheless, the family court awarded Wife $16,455.62 in attorneyâ€™s fees in the final decree of divorce.Â Â  \r\nHusband complains about the timing of the affidavit in support of the attorneyâ€™s fees.[4]Â  Although the usual practice certainly is to submit affidavits in support of attorneyâ€™s fees during the trial of a matter, we find the affidavit was timely submitted in the present case.Â  Husband agreed to allow Wife to submit her affidavit in support of attorneyâ€™s fees after the case, in order to include time expended on the trial.Â  Wifeâ€™s attorney was required to spend more time after testimony was completed to reconstruct the record and draft responses to various motions.Â  Further, Wifeâ€™s affidavit in support of attorneyâ€™s fees was submitted before a final order was signed and before the case was concluded by resolution of the issues.Â  Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in considering the affidavit in support of attorneyâ€™s fees in this case.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause the family court erred in apportioning the condominium contents equally, contrary to the only property settlement agreement presented to the court, we reverse and remand to the family court for a hearing to determine whether a subsequent agreement between the parties occurred and to equitably distribute the condominium proceeds.Â  We affirm the Wifeâ€™s alimony award, the award of the dog to Wife, the admittance of the psychiatric expert as a rebuttal witness, the finding of contempt, and the award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife.Â  \r\nFor the reasons stated, the family courtâ€™s decision is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.Â  \r\nANDERSON, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n[2] Wife raises a question regarding whether this issue is preserved for review.Â  Although Husband failed to file a post-judgment motion requesting the family court to address why the final order differed from the approved agreement, the approval of the agreement was raised to and ruled upon by the family court.Â  Accordingly, we address Husbandâ€™s issue on appeal.Â  \r\n[3] The family court is authorized by several statutes to award pendente lite alimony and suit costs.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(A) (Supp. 2004); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-120 (Supp. 2004); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-140 (Supp. 2004).Â  \r\n[4]Â  Husband does not complain that the affidavit submitted by counsel does not support the amount of the attorneyâ€™s fees or that the family court failed to consider the relevant factors in making the award.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-219","title":"Ralphs v.

Henry McKellar, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nJames B. Richardson, Jr. and Palmer Freeman, Jr., both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Terry A. Trexler, d/b/a The Trexler Law Firm, appeals from orders granting Richard J. Ralphs a default judgment and awarding damages and costs.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nRalphs brought a malpractice suit against Trexler, his former attorney, for among other claims, fraudulently inducing him to sign a deed to his house under the pretense that it was a mortgage securing his attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Trexlerâ€™s attorney, Curtis Murph, filed an answer denying Ralphsâ€™ claims.Â  Ralphs attempted to secure Trexlerâ€™s deposition on three separate occasions.Â  Each time, Ralphsâ€™ attorney and Murph agreed upon the date and time.Â  The final two occasions, Ralphsâ€™ attorney, Ralphs, and a court reporter waited more than two hours to see if Trexler would attend.Â  Murph attended the third scheduled deposition; however, he was unable to locate his client.\r\nWhen Trexler failed to attend a third deposition, Ralphs moved for sanctions under Rule 37, SCRCP.Â  He presented the affidavit of his attorney indicating the depositions were scheduled at times consented to by Murph, but no one attended.Â  Judge James E. Lockemy orally granted a motion to strike Trexlerâ€™s answer and to find him in default.Â  In the written motion, the court did not specifically strike the answer, but did hold Trexler in default.Â  Judge Lockemy also awarded Ralphs costs associated with preparing for and attending the depositions.\r\nTrexler, after retaining new counsel, filed motions pursuant to Rule 59 and 60, SCRCP.Â  Judge Lockemy denied the motion pursuant to Rule 59, finding it was not timely and was not properly served.Â  The Rule 60 motion was later heard before Master-in-Equity Linwood S. Evans.[1]Â  In his order dated March 10, 2003, Judge Evans found the Rule 60 motion was inappropriate because there was no final judgment and also concluded he could not overrule the decision of another judge.\r\nOn March 18, 2003, Judge Evans conducted the damages hearing and issued an order awarding $108,213 in actual damages, $50,000 in punitive damages, and prejudgment interest on the actual damages.Â  Also, Judge Evans noted the award was in addition to the costs awarded by Judge Lockemy at the sanctions hearing.\r\nTrexler then filed a motion asking the court to conduct a Gamble[2] hearing on the punitive damages.Â  Additionally, he filed a motion to reconsider the rulings, including the damages ruling.Â  Trexler filed his Notice of Appeal with this court on April 7, 2003, prior to obtaining a ruling on his outstanding motions.Â  This court stayed his appeal pending final disposition of the motions.\r\nOn December 11, 2003, Judge Evans granted Trexlerâ€™s motion to reconsider only as to the award of prejudgment interest and denied all remaining motions.Â  He issued an amended order, which reflected the change regarding prejudgment interest.Â  Trexler never filed an amended notice of appeal after receiving this order.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Sanctions\r\nTrexler asserts it was an abuse of discretion for Judge Lockemy to strike his answer and hold him in default for failing to attend the scheduled depositions.Â  We disagree.\r\nFirst, this issue is not properly preserved for review on appeal.Â  Judge Lockemy filed the order striking Trexlerâ€™s answer and holding him in default in October of 2000.Â  Trexler filed a motion under Rule 59, seeking to have Judge Lockemy reconsider that order.Â  Judge Lockemy ruled the motion was not timely filed and was not properly served pursuant to Rules 59(b) and (g), SCRCP.Â  Trexler never appealed the order by Judge Lockemy finding the motion untimely.Â  See Rule 203(b)(1), SCACR (requiring appeal to be filed within 30 days).Â  Thus, Trexler has waived his right to directly attack on appeal the findings of the October 2000 order, and the determinations of the court become the law of the case.Â  See Buckner v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., 255 S.C. 159, 161, 177 S.E.2d 544, 544 (1970) (stating an unchallenged ruling, â€œright or wrong, is the law of th[e] case and requires affirmanceâ€).\r\nWhile Trexler made a Rule 60 motion, he needed to appeal the original order and denial of his Rule 59 motion in order to raise the appropriateness of the sanction.Â  The Rule 60 motion collaterally attacked the default by asserting there was excusable neglect due to Trexlerâ€™s original counsel failing to inform him of the dates and times of the depositions.Â  Accordingly, we find in order to preserve his claim that the sanctions were an abuse of discretion, Trexler had to properly appeal from the order awarding sanctions or the denial of his motion pursuant to Rule 59.\r\n\r\nOn the merits, pursuant to Rule 37(d):Â  Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  \r\nIf a party . . . fails (1) to appear before the officer who is to take his deposition, after being served with a proper notice, . . . the court in which the action is pending on motion may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among others it may take any action authorized under paragraphs (A), (B), and (C) of subdivision (b)(2) of this rule.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\nRule 37(d), SCRCP; see also Karppi v. Greenville Terrazzo Co., Inc., 327 S.C. 538, 542, 489 S.E.2d 679, 682 (Ct. App. 1997) (explaining Rule 37, SCRCP, â€œexpressly grants the trial court power to order judgment by default for either the violation of a court order or, upon motion, for a partyâ€™s failure to respond to certain discovery requestsâ€).Â  \r\nWhen a court orders a sanction that results in default or dismissal, â€œthe end result is harsh medicine that should not be administered lightly.â€Â  Griffin Grading &amp; Clearing, Inc. v. Tire Serv. Equip. Mfg. Co., Inc., 334 S.C. 193, 198, 511 S.E.2d 716, 718 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The sanction should be aimed at the specific misconduct of the party sanctioned and should be reasonable.Â  Id. at 198, 511 S.E.2d at 719; Karppi, 327 S.C. at 543, 489 S.E.2d at 682.Â  Also, the court should â€œnot go beyond the necessities of the situation to foreclose a decision on the merits of a case.â€Â  Id.Â  Finally, when a sanction â€œwould be tantamount to granting a judgment by default, the moving party must show bad faith, willful disobedience or gross indifference to its rights to justify the sanction.â€Â  Griffin, 334 S.C. at 198-99, 511 S.E.2d at 719.\r\nRalphsâ€™ attorney attempted to schedule and hold depositions of Trexler on three occasions.[3]Â  Each deposition was scheduled through Murph.Â  Murph even attended the third deposition and was unable to locate Trexler, according to the affidavit of Ralphsâ€™ attorney.Â  As an attorney, Trexler should understand the importance of discovery and the excess work caused by his failure to attend.Â  Accordingly, Judge Lockemyâ€™s determination that Trexlerâ€™s willful failure to attend the depositions warranted the striking of his answer and finding him in default is affirmed.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Rule 60 Motion\r\nTrexler next contends the trial court erred in denying his motion pursuant to Rule 60 to set aside the default judgment.Â  We disagree.\r\nFirst, the motion appealed from was not timely, as the default judgment had not been entered.Â  Trexler was found in default after the trial judge struck his answer as a sanction for his discovery abuse.Â  In order to set aside the default, a motion pursuant to Rule 55 would have been necessary.Â  See Thynes v. Lloyd, 294 S.C. 152, 154, 363 S.E.2d 122, 123 (Ct. App. 1987) (finding Rule 55(c) allows the Circuit Court to grant relief from the entry of default, whereas Rule 60(b) allows the Circuit Court to grant relief from a final judgment).Â  \r\nSecond, Judge Evans correctly determined he did not have the authority to determine whether Judge Lockemy abused his discretion in awarding sanctions under Rule 37(b). Â Â Â Â Â  It is settled that one circuit judge does not have the power to review, modify, affirm or reverse the findings of another circuit judge.Â  Cook v. Taylor, 272 S.C. 536, 538, 252 S.E.2d 923, 924 (1979).\r\nAdditionally, this issue is not preserved for review on appeal.Â  Judge Evans issued his order denying the Rule 60 motion on March 10, 2003.Â  Subsequently, Trexler filed a motion to alter or amend the March 10 order.Â  He then filed his notice of appeal from the March 10 order, along with several other orders.Â  This court stayed his appeal pending the disposition of his outstanding motions, including the Rule 59 motion asking Judge Evans to reconsider, alter or amend his March 10 order.Â  After the Rule 59 motion was denied on December 11, 2003, Trexler failed to file an Amended Notice of Appeal to include the December 11 order in his appeal.Â  Accordingly, the trial judgeâ€™s determinations, including the finding that the March 10 order was appropriate, are the law of the case.Â  See Buckner, 255 S.C. at 161, 177 S.E.2d at 544 (stating an unchallenged ruling, â€œright or wrong, is the law of th[e] case and requires affirmanceâ€).\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Punitive Damages\r\nTrexler contends the trial court erred in awarding punitive damages to Ralphs.Â  He maintains Judge Evans improperly considered Trexlerâ€™s subsequent disbarment as a ground for awarding punitive damages and also incorrectly concluded there was a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct when Trexler accepted title to Ralphsâ€™ property to protect his fee.Â  We disagree.\r\nProcedurally, this issue is not properly preserved for several reasons.Â  First, the issue regarding the appropriateness of punitive damages does not appear in the record to have been raised to Judge Evans for consideration.Â  Trexlerâ€™s motion to alter or amend raises various issues related to the actual damages, but does not challenge the punitive damage award.Â  Accordingly, the issue is not preserved for review on appeal.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).\r\nSecond, Trexler challenged Judge Evansâ€™ March 23 order by way of a motion to alter or amend the judgment.Â  Additionally, he filed his Notice of Appeal to this court prior to receiving an order on his Rule 59 motion.Â  When Trexler received the order dated December 11, 2003, he was required to file an Amended Notice of Appeal to include this order in his appeal.Â  See Rules 203(b)(1) and (d)(2)(B), SCACR.Â  As he failed to appeal from this order, the findings made in the December 11 order are the law of the case.Â  See Buckner, 255 S.C. at 161, 177 S.E.2d at 544 (stating an unchallenged ruling, â€œright or wrong, is the law of th[e] case and requires affirmanceâ€).\r\nAdditionally, this issue would fail on the merits.Â  In Austin v. Specialty Transportation Services, Inc., this court explained in great detail the nature of punitive damages and the required findings prior to their award: \r\n\r\nPunitive damages, also known as exemplary damages, are imposed as punishment.Â  Punitive damages are allowed in the interest of society in the nature of punishment and as a warning and example to deter the wrongdoer and others from committing like offenses in the future. \r\n\r\nAustin v. Specialty Transp. Servs., Inc., 358 S.C. 298, 312, 594 S.E.2d 867, 874 (Ct. App. 2004) (citations omitted).Â  This court continued:\r\n\r\nOn the issue of punitive damages, the highest burden of proof known to the civil law is applicable. . . . In any civil action where punitive damages are claimed, the plaintiff has the burden of proving such damages by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Punitive damages can only be awarded where the plaintiff proves by clear and convincing evidence the defendantâ€™s misconduct was willful, wanton, or in reckless disregard of the plaintiffâ€™s rights. \r\n\r\nAustin, 358 S.C. at 313, 594 S.E.2d at 875 (citations omitted).\r\nWhile Judge Evans did consider the disciplinary order in his determination of awarding punitive damages, it was but one consideration.Â  He specifically found Trexler placed his own interests above those of Ralphs, whom he represented.Â  Additionally, he noted the fraudulent nature of how Trexler came to take title to Ralphsâ€™ property.Â  Finally, in noting the taking of the property to secure his fee, Judge Evans indicated Trexler likely violated Rule 1.8 of the Rules of Professional Conduct and Rule 407, SCACR, by taking a possessory interest in Ralphsâ€™ property that was adverse to his client.Â  Accordingly, we find clear and convincing evidence to support Judge Evans award of punitive damages.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, BEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The outstanding motion and a damages hearing was apparently referred to Judge Evans.Â  While the Rule 60 motion was filed in December of 2000, it was not heard until December of 2002, partly because Trexler was under an automatic stay from the United States Bankruptcy Court.\r\n[2] Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, 406 S.E.2d 350 (1991).\r\n[3] But cf. Balloon Plantation, Inc. v. Head Balloons, Inc., 303 S.C. 152, 154, 399 S.E.2d 439, 440 (Ct.

These being in violation of S.C. Code of Laws 16-3-653 Criminal Sexual Conduct with a Minor, 2nd Degree and Common Law Assault and Battery of a High and Aggravated Nature. . . .\r\n[Demetrius R.] did in June 2003 and while in the custody of DJJ . . . performed oral sex on [Clinton P.], also 14 years of age.Â  On or about July 17, 2003, while in his bedroom, [Demetrius R.] did masturbate [Clinton P.]. . . . These being in violation of S.C. Code of Laws 16-3-653 Criminal Sexual Conduct with a Minor, 2nd Degree and Common Law Assault and Battery of a High and Aggravated Nature. . . .\r\n\r\nThe petition titles indicated a birth date of October 23, 1988 for Clinton P. on his juvenile petition and a birth date of February 7, 1989 for Demetrius R. on his juvenile petition.Â  \r\nOn March 3, 2004, the petitions against both Clinton P. and Demetrius R. were brought before the family court.Â  At that time, the attorney for the two minors moved on behalf of both boys to dismiss the criminal sexual conduct charges.Â  She argued the petitions were deficient because they alleged that the minors were both fourteen years of age, and S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-655(3) requires an actor be older than the victim for that element of the offense.Â  \r\nThe State agreed that the petitions were charging second degree CSC with a minor â€œbased on the age issue.â€Â  However, the State asserted that Clinton P. was older than Demetrius R. by â€œthree months,â€ and therefore should be charged with the offense.Â  The State further argued that no person under the age of sixteen had the â€œcapacity to consent to any kind of sexual activity.â€Â  \r\nAfter noting both boys were fourteen years of age, the family court judge granted the minorsâ€™ motion to dismiss.Â  The boysâ€™ attorney also moved to dismiss the charge of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature arguing there was no allegation of any kind of battery.Â  The State again argued the two were â€œunder legal age to consent.â€Â  The family court judge noted there was no allegation of any coercion, threat or force, and granted the motion to dismiss these charges as well.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe only issue raised on appeal is whether the family court erred in â€œsummarily dismissing the juvenile petitions charging second degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor, where the facts alleged that the defendants, who were 14 years old, engaged in oral sex.â€2\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann Â§ 16-3-655, the statute prohibiting CSC with minors, provides as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) A person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree if the actor engages in sexual battery with the victim who is less than eleven years of age.\r\n(2) A person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct in the second degree if the actor engages in sexual battery with a victim who is fourteen years of age or less but who is at least eleven years of age.\r\n(3) A person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct in the second degree if the actor engages in sexual battery with a victim who is at least fourteen years of age but who is less than sixteen years of age and the actor is in a position of familial, custodial, or official authority to coerce the victim to submit or is older than the victim.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-655 (2003).\r\nThe State contends the family court improperly dismissed the juvenile petitions because the conduct set forth in the petitions constituted a violation of Â§ 16-3-655(2).Â  It further asserts, notwithstanding the applicability of Â§ 16-3-655(2), the petition against Clinton P. properly alleged conduct in violation of Â§ 16-3-655(3) since the petitions showed Clinton P. was more than three months older than Demetrius R.Â  It is clear, however, that in argument before the family court, the State took the position that the juvenile indictments alleged CSC with a minor in the second degree pursuant to Â§ 16-3-655(3), which requires either that the actor be older than the victim or the actor be in a position of familial, custodial, or official authority to coerce the victim.Â  It did not advance an argument that the conduct of the two minors fell under subsection (2) of the statute.Â  Because the State did not argue the allegations were sufficient under Â§ 16-3-655(2), it cannot raise that argument for the first time on appeal.Â  See State v. Rice, 348 S.C. 417, 420, 559 S.E.2d 360, 362 (Ct. App. 2001) (holding an argument not raised to the trial court is not preserved for appellate review).Â  Additionally, while the individual petitions do contain the birth date of the minor charged, the petitions do not also contain the birth date of the alleged victim.Â  Thus, neither petition sets forth facts alleging that either actor is older than the victim.Â  To the contrary, each petition alleges that the actor and victim were both â€œ14 years of age.â€Â  \r\nAt any rate, we find the petitions are fatally defective such that the family court properly dismissed them.Â  Our statutory law provides that â€œ[e]very indictment shall be deemed and judged sufficient and good in law which, in addition to allegations as to time and place, as required by law, charges the crime substantially in the language of the common law or of the statute prohibiting the crime or so plainly that the nature of the offense charged may be easily understood and, if the offense be a statutory offense, that the offense be alleged to be contrary to the statute in such case made and provided.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-20 (2003).Â  If an objection to the sufficiency of an indictment is timely made, the trial court â€œshould judge the sufficiency of the indictment by determining whether (1) the offense is stated with sufficient certainty and particularity to enable the court to know what judgment to pronounce, and the defendant to know what he is called upon to answer and whether he may plead an acquittal or conviction thereon; and (2) whether it apprises the defendant of the elements of the offense that is intended to be charged.â€Â  State v. Gentry, Op. No. 25949 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 7, 2005). Â â€œIn determining whether an indictment meets the sufficiency standard, the court must look at the indictment with a practical eye in view of all the surrounding circumstances.â€&nbsp; Id.Â  The requirement that a criminal defendant receive sufficient notice of the charges against him to enable him to prepare a defense applies in juvenile matters.Â  In re Corey B., 291 S.C. 108, 109, 352 S.E.2d 470, 470 (1987).Â  \r\nHere, the petitions themselves do not delineate which subsection it is relying on under Â§ 16-3-655 in charging CSC with a minor in the second degree, nor indicate the State is even relying on Â§ 16-3-655.Â  Rather, the petitions, while stating the juveniles are charged with the offense of CSC with a minor in the second degree, both erroneously allege the juvenilesâ€™ conduct is a violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-653, which provides, â€œA person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct in the second degree if the actor uses aggravated coercion to accomplish sexual battery.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-653(1) (2003).Â  Section 16-3-653 does not deal with CSC with a minor and the petitions do not allege any facts of aggravated coercion required under Â§ 16-3-653.Â  Because the petitions specify a violation of Â§ 16-3-653, which is the crime of second degree CSC that involves aggravated force and has no age element, but designate the offense for both Clinton P. and Demetrius R. as CSC with a minor in the second degree, we hold the petitions failed to apprise Clinton P. and Demetrius R. the elements of the offense intended to be charged and therefore failed to provide sufficient notice of the charges against the juveniles.Â  Accordingly, the family court properly dismissed the petitions.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order below is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n2 The State does not include in its issues on appeal a challenge to the family courtâ€™s dismissal of the assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN) charges.Â  See State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 694 (2003); Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (no point will be considered which is not set forth in the statement of issues on appeal).Â  Further, the State only devotes one statement to the ABHAN charges in its brief asserting that they should not have been dismissed because a minor under the age of sixteen is not capable of voluntarily consenting to a sexual battery.Â  This argument is so conclusory as to amount to an abandonment of the issue on appeal.Â  See State v. Jones, 344 S.C. 48, 58-59, 543 S.E.2d 541, 546 (2001) (finding argument was so conclusory it was abandoned on appeal).Â  Finally, the State does not challenge the family court judgeâ€™s ruling based on his finding that the petitions failed to allege any aggravating circumstance.Â  See State v. Primus, 349 S.C. 576, 580, 564 S.E.2d 103, 105 (2002) (ABHAN is an unlawful act of violent injury accompanied by circumstances of aggravation; circumstances of aggravation is an element of ABHAN).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-221","title":"Leake v.

Tallevast, Jr.Â  On November 21, 1997, the County mailed Ethridge a notice that the property had been sold.Â  In this letter, the County stated the last date of redemption for the property was October 6, 1998.Â  The County mailed Ethridge an official notice of redemption via certified mail, return receipt requested on August 21, 1998.Â  This notice of redemption listed the last date of redemption as October 6, 1998.Â  The notice was returned to the County unclaimed.Â  The Treasurer of the County issued a tax deed on January 11, 1999 to William D. Tallevast, Jr.Â  Tallevastâ€™s estate subsequently issued a deed of distribution to William D. Tallevast, V and Robert Elliott Tallevast, who immediately sold the property to David G. Leake and Amanda J. Leake.Â  \r\nOn July 23, 2002, the Leakes brought a declaratory judgment seeking a declaration they are fee simple owners of the property and requesting an injunction requiring Ethridge to vacate the premises.Â  In a counterclaim, Ethridge asserted the tax deed was void due to the Countyâ€™s failure to follow the statutory requirements for a tax sale.Â  The trial court granted the Leakesâ€™ motion to amend their reply to assert the statute of limitations.Â  The court found the County had complied with the applicable statutory requirements, held the statute of limitations barred Ethridgeâ€™s counterclaim, and declared the Leakes to be the owners of the real property.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Statute of Limitations\r\nWe first consider Ethridgeâ€™s argument that his counterclaim to set aside the tax deed is not barred by the provisions of section 12-51-160 of the South Carolina Code.Â  We agree.\r\nSection 12-51-160 of the South Carolina Code (2004) provides, â€œNo action for the recovery of land sold under the provisions of this chapter or for the recovery of the possession may be maintained unless brought within two years from the date of sale.â€Â  The supreme court found the former version of this statute of limitations[2] inapplicable to one in possession of property asserting a claim of ownership in defense of an action brought by the purchaser at a tax sale more than two years after receiving the tax deed.Â  Dibble v. Bryant, 274 S.C. 481, 487, 265 S.E.2d 673, 677 (1980).Â  The court found the â€œstatute was intended to bar a defaulting and ousted taxpayer from maintaining an action to defeat the title of the tax sale purchaser and recover the land if brought more than two years from the date the purchaser came into possession.â€Â  Id.Â  The court explained:\r\n\r\n[t]o deny the possessor a claim of rightful ownership would be to deny him any defense, and would enable a purchaser at a tax sale to circumvent the valid legal remedies available to the defendant in possession of the property by merely waiting more than two years to bring his action to oust the defendant.\r\n\r\nId. at 487-88, 265 S.E.2d at 677.\r\nHere, Ethridge remained in possession of the land.Â  As in Dibble, Ethridgeâ€™s efforts to defend the Leakesâ€™ action seeking to confirm title in themselves should not be thwarted by the statute of limitations.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court erred in finding the statute of limitations barred Ethridgeâ€™s defense.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRedemption Notice  \r\nEthridge argues the County failed to issue the notice of redemption in compliance with the statutory requirements and the noncompliance requires the tax sale to be set aside.Â  We agree.\r\nThe appellate courts of this state have â€œconsistently held the enforcing agencies of government to strict compliance with all the legal requirements surrounding tax sales.â€Â  Dibble v. Bryant, 274 S.C. 481, 483-84, 265 S.E.2d 673, 676 (1980); Rives v. Bulsa, 325 S.C. 287, 292, 478 S.E.2d 878, 880 (Ct. App. 1996) (citations omitted).Â  â€œThe sound view is that all requirements of law leading up to tax sales which are intended for the protection of the tax payer against surprise or the sacrifice of his property are to be regarded as mandatory and are to be strictly enforced.â€Â  Rives, 325 S.C. at 292-93, 478 S.E.2d at 881.Â  The failure to give proper notice is a fundamental defect in the tax proceedings which renders the proceedings absolutely void.Â  Donahue v. Ward, 298 S.C. 75, 83, 378 S.E.2d 261, 265 (Ct. App. 1989).\r\nA defaulting taxpayer may redeem the real property â€œwithin twelve months from the date of the delinquent tax sale.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann Â§12-51-90 (Supp. 2004).Â  The statutory requirements mandate that the defaulting taxpayer be given notice of the approaching end of the redemption period, providing the delinquent tax collector shall make the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested â€œ[n]either more than forty-five days nor less than twenty days before the end of the redemption period.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-120 (Supp. 2004).\r\nThe County held the tax sale for Ethridgeâ€™s property on October 6, 1997. Â The trial court accepted the Countyâ€™s argument at the hearing that the last day of redemption was actually October 5, 1998.Â  However, the notice of sale sent November 21, 1997 and the notice of redemption sent August 21, 1998 both stated that October 6, 1998 was the last day for redemption.Â  Therefore, we find the County is bound by the date it placed on its notices, rather than the date argued by its attorney at the hearing.Â  With October 6, 1998 as the last day of redemption, the earliest the County could have mailed the notice and remained in compliance with the statutory requirements was August 22, 1998.Â  However, the notice was mailed on August 21, 1998.Â  Thus, the notice was sent one day early.Â  \r\nThe County asserts the fact that the notice was sent one day early did not prejudice Etheridge because he never received the notice and never attempted to redeem the property.Â  Although Ethridge did not seek to redeem the property, the County is not excused from the strict compliance mandated by the laws of tax sales.Â  See Donahue, 298 S.C. at 83, 378 S.E.2d at 266 (finding without merit the argument that the defaulting taxpayer was not prejudiced by the tax collectorâ€™s failure to give statutory notice). Â As the County failed to strictly comply with the statutory notice requirements intended to protect the taxpayer against a sacrifice of his property, the tax sale must be set aside.Â  Therefore, we hold the trial court erred in not setting aside the defective tax sale.\r\nBecause we reverse the decision of the trial court based on the failed notice of redemption and find that Ethridge was not barred by the statute of limitations, we do not need to address the other issues Ethridge raises on appeal.\r\n REVERSED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The former version of the statute of limitations provided: â€œ[n]o action for . . . recovery . . . shall be maintained unless brought within two years from the date of such [tax] sale.â€Â  Dibble, 274 S.C. at 487, 265 S.E.2d at 677 (quoting S.C.

Dudek, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, and Senior Assistant Attorney General William Edgar Salter III, all of Columbia; and Solicitor John Gregory Hembree, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Eric Andrew Rieb appeals a murder conviction, arguing the trial court erred in excluding evidence of his prior psychiatric hospitalizations and refusing to present a jury charge on the law of self-defense.Â  We affirm.[1] \r\nFACTS\r\nIn March 2000, kitchen manager Joe Award hired Rieb, a college dropout with some professional culinary training and experience, as a line cook at the Outrigger, a local seafood restaurant.Â  During the initial weeks of his employment, Rieb rode back and forth to work with Award, who lived near him.Â  Shortly after being hired, Rieb was demoted to fry cook.Â  In mid-August, Award fired Rieb from the kitchen staff, citing his unreliability and serious drinking problem.Â  Following his termination, Rieb occasionally mentioned to others his professional dissatisfaction and personal dislike for Award.Â  Two weeks after being terminated, Rieb approached daytime manager Janice Smith about the possibility of being re-hired at the restaurant and working for her.Â  With Awardâ€™s approval, Rieb was re-hired on the restaurantâ€™s daytime cleaning staff, where he would rarely be in contact with Award.Â  At the end of October, the Outrigger terminated Award as nighttime manager. \r\nOn Sunday, November 19, Rieb was relaxing at his apartment with co-workers Blake Josephs and Jeremiah Lawson.Â  Around noon, Rieb began receiving phone calls from Award, who wanted Rieb to come over to his place for some drinks.Â  It was known to Rieb and other employees of the Outrigger that Award was homosexual.Â  The phone calls continued all afternoon.Â  Rieb told Award he might stop by, but communicated to Josephs and Lawson that he did not desire to do so.Â  After several calls, Rieb refused to speak with Award.Â  Josephs began answering the calls instead, and repeatedly told Award to stop harassing them; the calls, however, continued.Â  Finally, around 7:30 p.m., Josephs and Lawson suggested that Rieb go over to Awardâ€™s home and see what he wanted.Â  Rieb complied, left the apartment, and walked over a mile in the pouring rain to Awardâ€™s residence.\r\nApproximately forty-five minutes later, Rieb called his apartment from Awardâ€™s home to speak to Josephs.Â  Once Josephs was reached, Rieb told him and Lawson that he had just killed Award and needed help.Â  They told Rieb that they were on their way over to help him, so he should stay where he was, but then called 9-1-1 to report the crime.Â  The police drove to a nearby restaurant to meet Josephs, who directed them to Awardâ€™s home.\r\nOnce on the scene, law enforcement officers surrounded the residence and ordered Rieb to exit.Â  He was soon spotted breaking out a window in the rear of the building in an attempt to escape, but fled back into the home when ordered to halt.Â  Rieb eventually exited from the front of the house and peacefully surrendered.Â  After he was handcuffed, officers searched his person incident to the arrest.Â  Stuffed in his waistline near the small of his back, the police found a household steak knife. Â The search also revealed what appeared to be a severed penis in his front-right pocket.Â  Rieb was promptly arrested.\r\nUpon entering the small home, officers quickly discovered Award, badly beaten about the head and body, but still breathing, with his groin area exposed and severely mangled.Â  Emergency medical services were called expeditiously, but Award died soon thereafter.Â  A subsequent autopsy was inconclusive as to which specific injury caused Awardâ€™s death, but determined either the blunt trauma to his head or the bodily injuries could have alone proved fatal.Â  \r\nAccording to Rieb, he and Award began drinking alcohol together soon after his arrival.Â  In the relatively short time period he spent with Award, Rieb estimates he drank from eight to ten beers, around four shots of Vodka, and about four or five shots of Bourbon.Â  At some point in the evening, Award played a homosexual pornographic video on his large television.Â  Rieb testified that sometime thereafter he lost consciousness for what he believes was about forty-five minutes.Â  He claimed to have awoken to find himself standing in the kitchen.Â  Award was kneeling on the floor in front of him with his genitals exposed and began pleading with Rieb to perform oral sex on him.Â  At this point, Rieb admitted he â€œgot nauseous and . . . like a big bolt of adrenaline . . . got really psychedâ€ and hit Award in the head with a nearby brass chalice.Â  He also vaguely recalls hitting Award several times and stomping on his ribs while Award was â€œjust laying thereâ€ on the floor.Â  Rieb, however, claims no recollection of ever wielding a steak knife or cutting the victim. Â Â \r\nRieb was indicted and convicted of petit larceny,[2] mayhem, and murder.Â  The trial court sentenced him to concurrent terms totaling forty years of imprisonment.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI. Self-defense Charge\r\nRieb argues the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury on the law of self-defense.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe law to be charged to the jury is determined by the evidence presented at trial.Â  State v. Goodson, 312 S.C. 278, 280, 440 S.E.2d 370, 372 (1994).Â  In determining whether the evidence required a certain jury charge, we view the facts in a light most favorable to the defendant.Â  State v. Byrd, 323 S.C. 319, 321, 474 S.E.2d 430, 431 (1996).Â  Accordingly, if there is any evidence in the record to support self-defense, the issue should be submitted to the jury.Â  State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 260-261, 565 S.E.2d 298, 302 (2002).Â  \r\n It is well established in South Carolina that in order to establish a valid claim of self-defense, a defendant must prove: â€œ(1) he was without fault in bringing on the difficulty; (2) he actually believed he was in imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury; (3) a reasonably prudent person of ordinary firmness and courage would have entertained the same belief; and (4) he had no other probable means of avoiding the danger.â€Â  State v. Long, 325 S.C. 59, 62, 480 S.E.2d 62, 63 (1997).Â  To warrant a jury instruction on self-defense a defendant must produce evidence (albeit only a minimal amount of evidence, per this courtâ€™s standard of review) that if determined credible by the jury, would tend to establish each element of self-defense.Â  Failure to present evidence on any one element precludes a jury charge on the law of self-defense.Â  See, e.g., State v. Bryant, 336 S.C. 340, 345-46, 520 S.E.2d 319, 322 (1999) (finding that defendantâ€™s testimony failed to establish he did not bring on the difficulty; thus, a self-defense charge was not warranted); State v. Bruno, 322 S.C. 534, 536, 473 S.E.2d 450, 452 (1996) (finding that appellant â€œwas not entitled to a self-defense charge, because he presented no evidence that he believed he was in imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injuryâ€); Goodson, 312 S.C. at 280, 440 S.E.2d at 372 (finding defendant was not entitled to self-defense charge when he presented no evidence showing actual or perceived imminent danger).\r\nIn order to satisfy the fourth element of self-defense, the defendant must show that he had no other probable means of escape except to take the life of his aggressor or, stated another way, that: \r\n\r\n  Â . . . he had no other probable means of avoiding the danger of losing his own life or sustaining serious bodily harm than to act as he did in the particular instance; that it is oneâ€™s duty to avoid taking human life where it is possible to prevent it even to the extent of retreating from his adversary unless by doing so the danger of being killed or suffering serious bodily harm is increased or it is reasonably apparent that such danger would be increased. \r\n\r\nState v. Jackson, 227 S.C. 271, 279, 87 S.E.2d 681, 685 (1955).\r\nIn the present case, we have serious doubts as to whether Riebâ€™s testimony constituted sufficient evidence as to any element of self-defense to warrant the jury charge, especially when considering that one may only use such force as is reasonably necessary to defend oneself.Â  See Jackson, 227 S.C. at 279, 87 S.E.2d at 685.Â  We base our decision, however, on the fact that Riebâ€™s own version of the events transpiring at Awardâ€™s home utterly fails to explain why Rieb did not just decline Awardâ€™s sexual advances and leave the residence.Â  Although defense counsel sought at trial to establish Riebâ€™s belief that he was locked in the apartment, Rieb acknowledged in no uncertain terms on cross-examination that he did not realize the entrance to the residence was locked until after he had fatally beaten his host.Â  Rieb was not entitled to a self-defense charge at trial because he presented no evidence that he had no other means of avoiding the perceived danger.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nII. Exclusion of Psychiatric Hospitalization Evidence\r\nRieb argues the trial court erred in excluding evidence of his prior psychiatric hospitalizations. We disagree.\r\nAt trial, Rieb expressly declined to pursue an insanity defense.Â  Nevertheless, Rieb sought to establish, through his own testimony and that of others, that he has a history of psychiatric problems stemming from past instances of sexual abuse.Â  Rieb, his mother, and his sister proffered testimony that when he was eight years old, Riebâ€™s cousin molested both he and his sister.Â  This experience resulted in a noticeable change in Riebâ€™s personality and, about a year and half later, his parents were finally told about the abuse.Â  Rieb was then hospitalized for psychiatric treatment, diagnosed with attention deficit disorder, and medicated.Â  This treatment continued intermittently until his early twenties. Â Â \r\nRieb also proffered testimony of another incident of sexual abuse.Â  According to Rieb, when he was twenty-two, he was invited to the home of an older male acquaintance.Â  After the consumption of several alcoholic beverages, he â€œblacked outâ€ at the manâ€™s home and awoke to find the man sodomizing him.Â  Rieb fled the home, and was later treated for psychiatric distress relating to the incident.[3] \r\nAfter considering the above testimony and counselsâ€™ arguments concerning its admissibility, the trial court decided to allow all testimony relating to the two prior instances of abuse, but excluded all evidence of Riebâ€™s past psychiatric treatment.Â  Although the trial court clearly perceived the relevance of the past abuse in establishing Riebâ€™s actual belief that he was in imminent danger at the time he struck the victim, it concluded that all evidence of past psychiatric treatment would only be relevant to the affirmative defense of insanity, a defense that Rieb expressly declined to raise at trial.Â Â  \r\nOn appeal, Rieb argues this exclusion was erroneous because evidence of his medical treatment was critical to corroborating the past sexual abuse.Â  We are not convinced the exclusion of this evidence was reversible error.\r\nâ€œEvidence is relevant if it tends to establish or make more or less probable some matter in issue upon which it directly or indirectly bears.â€ State v. Alexander, 303 S.C. 377, 380, 401 S.E.2d 146, 148 (1991).Â  Certainly evidence of Riebâ€™s past medical treatment is relevant in the sense asserted by Rieb on appeal, namely because it does, to some degree, corroborate the instances of past sexual abuse.Â  However, even relevant evidence may be excluded â€œif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.â€Â  Rule 403, SCRE.Â  A trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding the competency of testimony under Rule 403, SCRE, should be reversed only in exceptional circumstances and this court is obligated to give great deference to the trial courtâ€™s judgment.Â  State v. Slocumb, 336 S.C. 619, 633, 521 S.E.2d 507, 514 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The decision to exclude evidence under Rule 403 should not be reversed simply because an appellate court believes it would have decided the matter otherwise. Id.Â  \r\nIn excluding the testimony in the present case, the court was simply accepting the Stateâ€™s argument that such evidence would likely mislead the jury into thinking an insanity or diminished capacity style defense was at issue in the trial.Â  Furthermore, as Rieb, his mother, father, and sister were allowed to testify regarding the occurrences, any corroboration of the past instances of abuse would have been cumulative; thus, the trail court acted within its discretion in excluding the evidence.\r\nMoreover, the psychiatric treatment evidence was introduced merely to corroborate the past sexual abuses and the past sexual abuses introduced to establish an element of self-defense.Â  Because the jury charge on self-defense was properly declined for lack of evidence on other elements, we see no undue prejudice in the testimonyâ€™s exclusion.Â  Â See State v. Mason, 215 S.C. 457, 463, 56 S.E.2d 90, 93 (1949) (affirming the exclusion of evidence that was merely cumulative and â€œof inconsequential probative value for the purpose for which is was offeredâ€).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause we find Rieb was not entitled to a jury charge on the law of self-defense and conclude there was no reversible error in the trial courtâ€™s exclusion of evidence regarding his past psychiatric treatment, Riebâ€™s convictions are hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] At trial, Rieb conceded that following the beating of Award, he took several bottles of beer and liquor from the home and hid them outside with the intention of taking them when his roommate arrived.Â  {R. 411-412}\r\n[3] This treatment occurred months later, when a court ordered Rieb to obtain alcohol dependency treatment after being arrested for DUI.Â  The occurrence was brought up and discussed during this court-ordered treatment.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-223","title":"State v.

Stemke, of Isle of Palms, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: James Todd, II, (Father) appeals the termination of his parental rights to his three children.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nIn 1998, pursuant to an action by the South Carolina Department of Social Services, the family court granted temporary legal custody of Fatherâ€™s two older children, James Todd, III, and Mason Todd, to Linda Dallas after finding a threat of physical neglect against Father and Tammy Todd, the childrenâ€™s mother (Mother).Â  Dallas is Motherâ€™s aunt.Â  After a judicial review hearing in December 1998, the family court issued an order dated May 17, 1999, granting Dallas and her husband Frankie Dallas permanent legal and physical custody of the children.Â  The May 17, 1999 custody order also prohibited both Mother and Father from having contact with the children except in a therapeutic setting, but allowed them to petition for visitation if they completed psychological counseling and a clarification process regarding the circumstances that led to the childrenâ€™s removal from their care.Â  Christian Todd, a third child born to Mother and Father on January 24, 2001, has lived with the Dallases since a few weeks after he was born. \r\nIn 2002, the Dallases brought the present action seeking to adopt James, Mason, and Christian, and to terminate Fatherâ€™s parental rights to all three children.Â  Mother, who was also a party to the proceedings, had waived her rights and consented to the adoption.Â  \r\nFollowing a hearing on September 16 and 17, 2003, the family court issued an order on January 13, 2004, terminating the parental rights of Father and Mother to the children and allowing their adoption by the Dallases.Â  Father appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  We disagree with Fatherâ€™s argument that the family court erred in terminating his parental rights for willful failure to visit.Â  \r\nThe family court may order a termination of parental rights upon finding thatÂ  (1) a child has lived outside the home of either parent for six months and during that time the parent has willfully failed to visit the child, and (2) termination is in the childâ€™s best interest.[2]\r\nThe family court found Father had no contact with any of the children since December 1998.Â  Father does not dispute this finding on appeal.Â  In his brief, however, he argues he left South Carolina for a significant period of time to seek employment, had made several unsuccessful attempts to contact the children by calling the Dallasesâ€™ residence to schedule visits with them during their therapy appointments, and was not aware that under the custody order he could petition for visitation with the children after completing certain steps in a treatment program.Â  \r\n The arguments that Father advances on appeal do not undermine the family courtâ€™s finding that Father willfully failed to visit the children.Â  Father does not contest the finding in the appealed order that he was â€œconstantly moving his residence from one state to another without providing the [Dallases] or his children with his current whereabouts or with any other information that would provide a means for them to contact him if they desired to, thereby purposely eliminating himself from the lives of his children and all manner of contact with them.â€Â  As to Fatherâ€™s attempt to schedule visits with the children through the Dallases, Linda Dallas denied that Father called her to inquire about the childrenâ€™s therapy appointments.Â  The family court found her testimony to be much more credible than that offered by Father.[3]Â  Finally, we are not persuaded by Fatherâ€™s assertions that he was unaware of the provisions in the custody order under which he could petition for visitation.Â  It is apparent from that order that he was present and represented by counsel at the hearing and there appears to be no dispute that he was aware of another provision in the same order restricting his contact with the children.\r\n2.Â  Similarly, Father contends the Dallases failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that he willfully failed to support the children so as to warrant termination of his parental rights.Â  On appeal, Father asserts (1) he was disabled and this disability limited his capacity to pursue gainful employment; (2) he attempted to provide health insurance for the children through his employment at Wal-Mart, but was unable to because he did not have their social security numbers; and (3) he provided the children gifts, clothes, toys, Wal-Mart gift cards, and money orders.Â  We find these arguments unavailing.Â  \r\nAs noted by the family court, Father provided no corroborating evidence of the injury that led to his alleged disability and Wal-Mart already had the childrenâ€™s social security numbers because the children had previously been insured through Motherâ€™s employment with Wal-Mart.Â  The family court also found that Father failed to provide corroborating evidence that he had sent the children gifts and noted that, even if he were to be given credit for what he claimed to have sent, the full dollar value of all the gifts that Father purportedly sent the children since they began residing with the Dallases was insignificant at best.[4]\r\n3.Â  Finally, Father asserts the family court erred in finding the best interests of the children would be served by termination of his parental rights.Â  Specifically, he contends (1) because he does not object allowing the Dallases to retain custody of the children, the only significant change that would result from their adoption by the Dallases would be that their last name would be changed; and (2) there was a complete lack of evidence as to what was in the best interest of Christian, the youngest child.Â  We reject these arguments.Â  \r\nStatutes authorizing the termination of parental rights â€œmust be liberally construed in order to ensure prompt judicial procedures for freeing minor children from the custody and control of their parents by terminating the parent-child relationship. The interests of the child shall prevail if the childâ€™s interest and the parental rights conflict.â€[5]Â  â€œParental rights do not spring full-blown from the biological connection between parent and child.Â  They require relationships more enduring.â€[6]\r\nContrary to Fatherâ€™s first argument, the family court found that, based on statements by the counselor for one of the children as well as testimony from Linda Dallas and the guardian ad litem, the children â€œwould suffer severe psychological and emotional harm if they were to ever again to have contact with [Father] in the future, or if they were to ever be separated from each other.â€Â  The family court further determined that the adoption of the children by the Dallases â€œwould benefit them psychologically, socially, and emotionally, and would allow them to enjoy the benefits of belonging to a true family and the ability to call the [Dallases], who they regard as their parents, Mom and Dad.â€Â  \r\nTo the extent that Fatherâ€™s argument regarding the youngest child has been preserved for appeal, we agree with the Dallases that the record supports a finding that Father had absolutely no relationship with Christian and expressed no desire to have one.Â  To the contrary, there was undisputed evidence that Father not only attempted to deny that Christian was his biological child but also demanded that Mother â€œsellâ€ the child for $25,000.Â  We therefore hold the family courtâ€™s finding that termination of Fatherâ€™s parental rights is in the best interests of all three children.[7]\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  S.C.

Bundrick brought claims against East Richland County Public Service District for improper installation and maintenance of a sewer line and drainage ditch.Â  The trial court found the statute of repose barred their claims.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThe District obtained a right of way and easement to construct a sewer line on undeveloped property in 1972.Â  The District contracted with two companies to install the line.Â  The construction of the line on the Bundricksâ€™ future property was completed in October 1972, and construction on the entire line was completed by 1974.Â  During 1972, the flow of a creek on the property was diverted through an aluminum pipe running perpendicular to the line, though the District denied it or its contractors installed the pipe.Â  \r\nThe Bundricks purchased the property in 1984, and applied for sewer service from the District in 1986.Â  The Bundricks built a house and moved onto the previously undeveloped land in October 1986.Â  They soon began to experience trouble with soil erosion and noticed their house developed structural distress.Â  They surmised the aluminum pipe running near the sewer line caused the difficulties.Â  The Bundricks sued the District in February 2000.\r\nAt trial, the Bundricks asserted their problems were caused by the Districtâ€™s improper placement of the aluminum pipe near the sewer line.Â  They further claimed the District failed to properly maintain the pipe.Â  \r\nThe District presented evidence supporting its denial of ownership over the aluminum pipe.Â  It also presented evidence establishing that neither the District nor its contractors installed the aluminum pipe.Â  In its answer, the District asserted the statute of repose barred the Bundricksâ€™ claims and the trial court agreed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn an appeal from a master in equity, this court has the same scope of review as if the appeal was from a circuit court sitting without a jury.Â  Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 237, 391 S.E.2d 538, 543 (1990).Â  A suit based on negligence is an action at law.Â  Sims&nbsp;v. Hall, 357 S.C. 288, 592 S.E.2d 315 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Furthermore, while we may correct errors of law, we must affirm a masterâ€™s factual findings unless they are without evidentiary support.Â  Sims, 357 S.C. at 294-95, 592 S.E.2d at 318.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Bundricks argue the master erred in finding their claims were barred by the statute of repose.Â  We disagree.\r\nA.Â  Statute of Repose\r\nThe legislature codified a thirteen-year statute of repose in S.C. Code Ann. section 15-3-640 (2005).Â  The statute places a bar on actions based on defective improvements to real property.Â  It reads, in part:\r\n\r\nNo actions to recover damages based upon or arising out of the defective or unsafe condition of an improvement to real property may be brought more than thirteen years after substantial completion of such an improvement.Â  For purposes of this section, an action based upon or arising out of the defective or unsafe condition of an improvement to real property includes:\r\n. . .\r\n(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an action to recover damages for the negligent construction or repair of an improvement to real property;\r\n(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an action to recover damages for personal injury, death, or damage to property;\r\n(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an action to recover damages for economic or monetary loss;\r\n(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an action in contract or tort or otherwise;\r\n. . .\r\n(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an action brought against any current or prior owner of the real property or improvement \r\n. . .\r\nThis section describes an outside limitation of thirteen years after the substantial completion of the improvement, within which normal statutes of limitations continue to run.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-640 (2005).\r\nA statute of repose represents â€œan absolute time limit beyond which liability no longer exists.â€Â  Langley v. Pierce, 313 S.C. 401, 404, 438 S.E.2d 242, 243 (1993) (quoting First United Methodist Church v. United States Gypsum Co., 882 F.2d 862, 865-66 (4th Cir. 1989)).Â  The statute is a societal recognition that at some point in the future liability no longer exists.Â  â€œWhen causes of action are extinguished after such time, society generally may continue its business and personal relationships in peace, without worry that some cause of action may arise to haunt it because of some long-forgotten act or omission.â€Â  Langley, 313 S.C. at 404, 438 S.E.2d at 244 (quoting Kissel v. Rosenbaum, 579 N.E.2d 1322, 1326-28 (Ind. Ct. App. 1991)).Â  \r\nTo further that purpose, a statute of repose, unlike a statute of limitations, cannot be defeated by estoppel, waiver, or claims of tolling.Â  G&amp;P Trucking v. Parks Auto Sales Svc. &amp; Salvage, Inc., 357 S.C. 82, 89, 591 S.E.2d 42, 45 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  In short, a statute of repose is a substantive defense that prevents a cause of action from coming into being after a pre-determined period of time.Â  See Langley, 313 S.C. at 403-04, 438 S.E.2d at 243-44.\r\nThe statute of repose applies to the Bundricksâ€™ action because it is one â€œbased upon or arising out of the defective or unsafe condition of an improvement to real property.â€Â  The Districtâ€™s easement is real property.Â  South Carolina Pipeline Corp. v. Lone Star Steel Co., 345 S.C. 151, 153, 546 S.E.2d 654, 656 (2001) (holding an easement is â€œreal propertyâ€ for S.C. Code Ann. section 15-3-640 purposes).Â  Further, the sewer line is an improvement to that property.Â  Id. at 154, 546 S.E.2d at 657.\r\nThe Bundricks had thirteen years to bring their suit from the date the sewer was completed.Â  Whether the applicable date to start counting is 1972, when the sewer project was completed on the affected property, or 1974, when the entire project was completed, the Bundricksâ€™ February 2000 lawsuit was clearly filed beyond the thirteen-year deadline and is, therefore, barred by the statute of repose.Â  \r\nB.Â  Ownership Exception\r\nThe Bundricks argue the statute of repose is inapplicable because the District is in possession of the improvement complained of.Â  In support of their argument, they cite to S.C. Code Ann. section 15-3-670, which codifies the ownership exception as follows:\r\n\r\n[The statute of repose] may not be asserted as a defense by any person in actual possession or control, as owner, tenant, or otherwise, of the improvement at the time the defective or unsafe condition constitutes the proximate cause of the injury or death for which it is proposed to bring an action, in the event such person in actual possession or control knows, or reasonably should have known, of the defective or unsafe condition. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-670 (2005).\r\nThere is no dispute the District owns the easement, which is real property.Â  The District acknowledges its ownership of the sewer lines.Â  However, the District presented evidence at trial that denied it or its contractors installed or owned the aluminum pipe.Â  \r\nIt is the aluminum pipe that is the â€œimprovementâ€ alleged to have caused the Bundricksâ€™ damages.Â  Therefore, it is the ownership of the defective aluminum pipe that would trigger the section 15-3-670 exception.Â  Only if the District owned the aluminum pipe would it be barred from asserting the statute of repose as a defense.Â  \r\nIn finding against the Bundricks, the master rejected their argument that the District owned the aluminum pipe, which they allege was the culprit.Â  There is evidence in the record to support the masterâ€™s conclusion that the District did not own the defective aluminum pipe.Â  Accordingly, the District is not barred by section 15-3-670 from asserting the statute of repose as a defense.\r\nC.Â  Gross Negligence Exception\r\nFinally, the Bundricks assert the District may not avail itself of the statute of repose because it was grossly negligent.Â  We disagree.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. section 15-3-670 prohibits defendants from using the statute of repose if they engaged in grossly negligent conduct.Â  Simple negligence is the â€œfailure to exercise due care, while gross negligence is the failure to exercise slight care.â€Â  Clyburn v. Sumter County Sch. Dist. No. 17, 317 S.C. 50, 53, 451 S.E.2d 885, 887 (1994) (citations omitted).Â  \r\nThe exception contained in the statute of repose, by its strict terms, applies to grossly negligent conduct in connection with the construction of the improvement.Â  There is no evidence in the record that the sewer line itself was constructed in a negligent manner.Â  The fact that there was no complaint for a period in excess of fourteen years following the completion of this portion of the line belies an assertion of even simple negligence, much less gross negligence.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n GOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-226","title":"Dinkins v.

Jonas, of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\nW. Thomas Lavender, Jr. and Leon C. Harmon, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Lana and Oree Dinkins brought this action against Winnsboro Petroleum Co., alleging Lana suffered from physical and mental disabilities caused by the long-term ingestion of toxic petroleum solvents that leaked from underground storage tanks located on property near their home.Â  Oreeâ€™s claims were based on a loss of consortium.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment to Winnsboro Petroleum based on, among other things, the running of the statute of limitations.Â  The Dinkinses appeal. Â We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nLana and her husband, Oree, lived on a lot in Ridgeway, South Carolina, from approximately 1956 to 1992.[1]Â  In late 1992, they sold the lot to a gold mining company (Kennecott) that operated nearby.Â  The lot was located beside a tract of approximately twenty acres that at one time was owned by Oree Dinkinsâ€™s father, E.O. Dinkins.Â  E.O. Dinkins built a small country store on the property that began operation around 1948.Â  Gasoline was sold at the store, for which there was an underground storage tank system.Â Â Â  \r\nWinnsboro Petroleum acquired ownership of the property held by E.O. Dinkins at a foreclosure sale in 1957.Â  Although he was no longer the owner, E.O. Dinkins thereafter operated the store with the permission of Winnsboro Petroleum until the store closed upon his death in 1989.Â  During its operation, Winnsboro Petroleum supplied gasoline to its store, pumping it into the underground storage tanks.Â Â Â  \r\nIn 1987, E.O. Dinkins filed suit to quiet title to the property and to enforce an alleged agreement that Winnsboro Petroleum would reconvey the property to him.Â  E.O. Dinkins contended that over the years he had paid a surcharge on each gallon of gasoline purchased in order to reclaim his property.Â  Winnsboro Petroleum alleged, however, that E.O. Dinkins operated the store with its consent and paid rent based on the amount of gasoline sold.Â  It denied there was ever any agreement to reconvey the property.Â Â Â  \r\nThe parties eventually settled the matter by Winnsboro Petroleum granting E.O. Dinkins and his wife a life estate in five acres of the property that included the store site.Â  E.O. Dinkins died in 1989.Â  His wife died a few years after her husband, at which time the life estate reverted to Winnsboro Petroleum.Â  \r\nDuring the time the Dinkins store was still in operation, Lana and Oree Dinkins moved next to the property that Winnsboro Petroleum had acquired.Â  For their water supply, they initially used a well dug by Oreeâ€™s father.Â  After it went dry, they drilled a second well to supply water and, later, a third well.Â Â Â  \r\nAccording to Lana Dinkins, they used the water from the third well, which had been dug near the Dinkins store, although they noticed the water had an odor and â€œit didnâ€™t taste good.â€Â  Oree Dinkins also stated, â€œ[W]e knew the . . . [well water] wasnâ€™t hardly fit to drink, but we didnâ€™t . . . we didnâ€™t know why.â€Â  Despite the problems with the water, however, they never had it tested.Â Â Â  \r\nSometime in the late 1980s or early 1990s, Lanaâ€™s health began to decline; she experienced blisters on her face and mouth, kidney infections, respiratory problems, and digestive problems.Â  She initially attributed her poor health to dust from gold mining activities near her home, and she visited several doctors.Â  On several occasions the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) analyzed dust samples both inside and outside the Dinkinsesâ€™ home, but it concluded that they contained only â€œroad dust.â€Â  In late 1992, when Lanaâ€™s health did not improve, the Dinkinses sold their property to the mining company.Â  \r\nIn 1993, Winnsboro Petroleum removed the two underground storage tanks from the store site pursuant to its participation in the State Underground Petroleum Environmental Response Bank (â€œSUPERBâ€) Act administered by DHEC.Â  The Dinkinses were both present when the tanks were removed.Â  Lana Dinkins recalled that she â€œwas very sick that day,â€ but she noticed the tanks were crumbling and had a foul odor.Â  She also remembered that around that time â€œthere was much publicity about the clean up there[.]â€Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn early 2002, Lana and Oree Dinkins filed this action against Winnsboro Petroleum and others, alleging causes of action for negligence, negligence per se, assault and battery, and loss of consortium.Â  The Dinkinses asserted in pertinent part that, while residing at their home until approximately 1992, they depended upon three different wells for their water, all of which were located in close vicinity to the Winnsboro Petroleum property.Â  They alleged that â€œthe land owned by . . . Winnsboro Petroleum contained two deteriorated and corroded underground gasoline storage tanks that were leaking petroleum products and contaminants into the groundwater that supplied [their] drinking water.â€Â  The Dinkinses asserted the contamination had resulted in mental and physical health problems to Lana and a loss of consortium for her husband,\r\nOree.&nbsp; \r\nThe trial court granted summary judgment to Winnsboro Petroleum based, in part, on the running of the statute of limitations.Â  The Dinkinses appeal. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhen reviewing the grant of summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP.â€Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  â€œSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Baird v. Charleston County,&nbsp;333 S.C. 519, 529, 511 S.E.2d 69, 74&nbsp;(1999). Â â€œIn determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€Â  Summer v. Carpenter,&nbsp;328 S.C. 36, 42, 492 S.E.2d 55, 58&nbsp;(1997).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, the Dinkinses argue the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Winnsboro Petroleum on its claims for negligence and negligence per se.[2]Â  We disagree.\r\nAs one of the grounds for granting summary judgment,[3] the trial court found that the action was barred by the three-year statute of limitations set forth in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530 (2005).Â Â Â  \r\nIn applying the statute of limitations, South Carolina recognizes the discovery rule, which provides that â€œthe statute of limitations begins to run when a cause of action reasonably ought to have been discovered.â€Â  Dean v. Ruscon Corp., 321 S.C. 360, 363, 468 S.E.2d 645, 647 (1996).Â  The statute does not run from the date of the negligent act, but from when the injury resulting from the negligent act is discovered or may be discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence.Â  McClain v. Jarrard, 354 S.C. 218, 580 S.E.2d 763 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nOur supreme court has interpreted the exercise of reasonable diligence to mean â€œthat an injured party must act with some promptness where the facts and circumstances of an injury would put a person of common knowledge and experience on notice that some right of his has been invaded or that some claim against another party might exist.â€ Â Snell v. Columbia Gun Exch., Inc., 276 S.C. 301, 303, 278 S.E.2d 333, 334 (1981).Â  â€œThe statute of limitations begins to run from this point and not when advice of counsel is sought or [a] full-blown theory of recovery is developed.â€Â  Johnston v. Bowen, 313 S.C. 61, 64, 437 S.E.2d 45, 47 (1993).Â  Moreover, â€œ[t]he date of discovery is not when the plaintiff discovers a witness to support or prove his [or her] case.â€Â  Id. at 64-65, 437 S.E.2d at 47.\r\nWhether the particular plaintiff actually knew he or she had a claim is not the relevant inquiry; instead, the date on which a discovery should have been made is an objective question.Â  Young v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections, 333 S.C. 714, 511 S.E.2d 413 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The fact that the injured party does not comprehend the full extent of his or her injuries is immaterial.Â  Dean, 321 S.C. at 364, 468 S.E.2d at 647.Â  \r\nIn the case now before us, the trial court found that, although the complaint alleged that Lana had gradually become sick and was not definitively diagnosed with having gasoline exposure until 2001, her husband, Oree, testified that his wife had been sick for at least six or seven years prior to filing the complaint.Â  The trial court further noted that Oree testified that his father, E.O. Dinkins, had told him that he thought gasoline was escaping from the underground tanks.Â  This conversation occurred prior to the storeâ€™s closing and E.O. Dinkinsâ€™s death in 1989.Â Â Â  \r\nIn addition, both Lana and Oree testified that they were present when the underground storage tanks were removed in 1993.Â  At that time, Lana noticed the tanks were crumbling and had a foul odor.Â  She was also aware that E.O. Dinkins was of the opinion that gasoline was leaking from the tanks.Â  Based on these facts, the trial court concluded the Dinkinses were on notice that a potential claim might exist by 1992 or 1993 and that this action, instituted in 2002, was â€œbrought well outside the statute of limitations.â€Â  \r\nAlthough we are sympathetic to the Dinkinsesâ€™ plight, we agree with the trial court that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Dinkinses, the statute of limitations has run on their claims.Â  Oree Dinkins stated he and his wife were both present when the tanks were removed.Â  Oree testified that his father, E.O. Dinkins, could not figure out why he had to purchase gasoline so often, telling him, â€œI know I havenâ€™t sold that much.â€Â  Oree also testified in his deposition that they â€œknew the [water] wasnâ€™t hardly fit to drink,â€ and Lana testified that the water had a foul odor.Â  Notes from a physicianâ€™s visit Lana made on May 24, 1999 indicate that she had been sick for eight to ten years and that â€œ[s]he moved five years ago because she knew the water was bad.â€Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing as well as the findings of the trial court, we hold the order of the trial court granting summary judgment to Winnsboro Petroleum should be \r\n AFFIRMED.[4]\r\nGOOLSBY, STILWELL, and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  There is some variation in the dates in the record.Â  The trial court noted the Dinkinses moved to their property in 1956, which is the date testified to by Oree Dinkins; however, the date 1966 also appears in the record.Â Â Â  \r\n[2]Â  As noted by Winnsboro Petroleum in its brief, the Dinkinses do not specifically assert arguments regarding their claims for assault and battery and loss of consortium.Â  Thus, we need not consider those claims here.Â  See Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (â€œOrdinarily, no point will be considered which is not set forth in the statement of the issues on appeal.â€); First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 444 S.E.2d 513 (1994) (concluding issues for which the appellant failed to provide any argument or supporting authority were deemed abandoned); Stier, Kent &amp; Canady, Inc. v. Jackson, 317 S.C. 179, 452 S.E.2d 606 (Ct. App. 1994) (stating where the only argument in the appellantsâ€™ brief regarding an issue appeared in a footnote without any citation to authority, the argument was so conclusory that the issue was deemed abandoned). \r\n[3]Â  Since we agree with the trial court that the statute of limitations has run on the Dinkinsesâ€™ claims, that ruling is dispositive of the case and in itself supports affirming the grant of summary judgment to Winnsboro Petroleum.Â  Thus, we need not reach the additional grounds the trial court relied on in granting summary judgment.Â  See Fuller-Ahrens Partnership v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 311 S.C. 177, 427 S.E.2d 920 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding when an appellate court affirms a trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment on a particular ground, the appellate court need not discuss the remaining grounds); Weeks v. McMillan, 291 S.C. 287, 292, 353 S.E.2d 289, 292 (Ct. App. 1987) (â€œWhere a decision is based on alternative grounds, either of which independent of the other is sufficient to support it, the decision will not be reversed even if one of the grounds is erroneous.â€).\r\n[4]Â  To the extent the Dinkinses further argue on appeal that Winnsboro Petroleum should be equitably estopped from asserting the statute of limitations, we find this argument is not properly before us because it was not raised to and ruled on by the trial court.Â  Talley v. South Carolina Higher Educ. Tuition Grants Comm., 289 S.C. 483, 347 S.E.2d 99 (1986) (holding an issue must be both raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-227","title":"Bracey v.

Spruill, III, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-227\r\nSubmitted March 1, 2005 â€“ Filed March 31, 2005\r\n\r\nDISMISSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJohn Bracey, pro se, of Ridgeville, for Appellant.\r\nNo Appearance by Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this domestic case, John Bracey (Husband) appeals an order of the family court dismissing his action seeking a divorce from his wife, Maxine Bracey, on the grounds of desertion.Â  Because Husband raises no cognizable appellate issue to this court, we are constrained to dismiss this appeal.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nHusband is an inmate in the custody of the South Carolina Department of Corrections.Â  Proceeding pro se, he filed papers with the family court asking it to â€œgrant a decree of Divorce on the grounds [of] Desertion.â€Â  In this filing, Husband claimed he had â€œnot seen or heard from [Wife] in over (10) ten years.â€ \r\nThe family court judge reviewed Husbandâ€™s case file and, in a written order, found: â€œThere is no summons, the complaint is not adequate, and the attempted service by publication does not comply with the requirements of the law.â€Â  The court therefore ordered that: â€œThis matter is dismissed to be pursued by [Husband] when he gets out and can get some help with it.â€Â  Husband now appeals this ruling.Â  \r\nIn his final brief filed with this court, Husband sets out the issue on appeal as whether the family court erred in â€œnot granting divorce at the February 19, 2004, hearing[1] in Marlboro County Court.â€Â  His argument, in its entirety, reads: â€œGrant the appeal so that appellant may present to the Family Court of Marlboro County the divorce decree package accepted in the Fourth Judicial district on grounds of desertion.â€ \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWe find Husband has failed to raise an issue on appeal that may be properly considered and decided by this court.Â  \r\nHusband raises no specific exception to the ruling of the family court.Â  Husband does nothing more than assert the family courtâ€™s ruling was incorrect.Â  Such broad, general statements of issues on appeal may be disregarded by the appellate court. Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR; Sullivan Co. v. New Swirl, Inc., 313 S.C. 34, 36, 437 S.E.2d 30, 31 (1993) (noting that broad statements of issues made by appellant seeking to overturn grant of summary judgment may be disregarded by reviewing court); State v. Burroughs, 328 S.C. 489, 496, 492 S.E.2d 408, 411 (Ct. App. 1987) (noting that separate issues should be set forth and argued separately rather than lumped together under a single, broad issue).Â  \r\nMoreover, Husbandâ€™s argument in his brief is purely conclusory, citing no legal authority[2] and addressing none of the procedural defects identified by the family court in its order dismissing the case.Â  Conclusory arguments constitute an abandonment of the issue on appeal. See Solomon v. City Realty Co., 262 S.C. 198, 201, 203 S.E.2d 435, 436 (1974) (finding that where only passage in brief relating to issue appealed was single conclusory statement which left â€œunargued the error assigned by [the] exceptionâ€ and was not even â€œmanifestly correct,â€ issue was abandoned); see also State v. Colf, 332 S.C. 313, 321, 504 S.E.2d 360, 364 (Ct. App. 1998) (holding that an issue is deemed abandoned if argument in brief is merely conclusory); State v. Black, 319 S.C. 515, 518, 462 S.E.2d 311, 313 (Ct. App. 1995) (finding a conclusory argument of an issue by appellant amounts to an abandonment of the issue).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause Husband failed to adequately raise or argue any cognizable appellate issue to this court, the present appeal is\r\nDISMISSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.Â Â  \r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â  [1] There is no indication in the record that a hearing was ever conducted on this matter before the family court.Â  As noted above, the family court dismissed the case based on its review of the file.\r\nÂ Â Â Â  [2] Husband does list three South Carolina cases in his Table of Authorities.Â  However, none of these cases are cited or otherwise referred to in his argument.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
