Joye appeals the grant of summary\r\n  judgment to Worsley Companies (Worsley), arguing the circuit court erred\r\n  because genuine issues of material fact existed and Worsley was not entitled to\r\n  judgment as a matter of law.  We affirm.  \r\nWe find the trial\r\n  court did not err in holding no dangerous condition existed.  See Wintersteen\r\n    v. Food Lion, Inc., 344 S.C. 32, 36, 542 S.E.2d 728, 730 (2001) (stating a storekeeper owes an invitee the duty of exercising\r\n  reasonable or ordinary care for the invitee's safety and to keep aisles in a reasonably\r\n  safe condition, but he &quot;is not an insurer of the safety of his customers&quot;). \r\n  Joye acknowledged the aisle was wide and the crates were lined up with other\r\n  items.  Furthermore, she admitted nothing obscured her vision and the crates\r\n  were not hidden by &quot;tablecloths or anything like that.&quot;  She even\r\n  admitted she saw the crates.  At oral argument, Joye acknowledged displays in\r\n  aisles are not always unreasonably dangerous and was unable to identify any feature\r\n  that made the Better Brands display distinctive or more dangerous.  Joye failed\r\n  to set forth any specific facts showing that the display, which sat, visible,\r\n  in a row of other items separating the aisle, was a dangerous condition.  See Hoard ex rel. Hoard v. Roper Hosp., Inc., 387 S.C. 539, 549, 694 S.E.2d\r\n  1, 6 (2010) (stating Rule 56(e), SCRCP, requires that when a motion for summary\r\n  judgment is made and supported as provided by the rule, an adverse party may\r\n  not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleadings); id. (stating\r\n  the adverse party's response, including affidavits or as otherwise provided by\r\n  the rule, must set forth specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for\r\n  trial).  Accordingly, we find the trial court did not err in granting Worsley\r\n  summary judgment.

Cliff Moore, III, of Columbia, for Respondents. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Louis Brown appeals the trial court's\r\n  ruling that Brown does not possess title to fifty-five acres of property\r\n  (Property) in Berkeley County.  We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and\r\n  the following authorities:\r\nAs to Brown's argument the\r\n  trial court erred in failing to find the Property existed within the excess\r\n  acreage of the Respondent Landowners:  Lake View Acres Dev. Co. v. Tindal,\r\n  306 S.C. 477, 480, 412 S.E.2d 457, 459 (Ct. App. 1991) (&quot;[I]t is\r\n  elementary 'that boundaries govern acreage and inaccuracies relating to the\r\n  area of a tract are generally immaterial['] if the description clearly\r\n  identifies the land conveyed and its boundaries.&quot; (quoting Brownlee v.\r\n    Miller, 208 S.C. 252, 260, 37 S.E.2d 658, 661 (1946))); Eldridge v. City\r\n      of Greenwood, 331 S.C. 398, 435, 210, 503 S.E.2d 191, 210 (1998) (&quot;[I]n\r\n  an action to quiet title, the plaintiff must recover on the strength of his own\r\n  title, not on the alleged weakness of the defendant's title.&quot;).  \r\nAs to Brown's\r\n  argument the trial court erred in finding that Brown did not possess title to\r\n  the Property on the basis of adverse possession:  McDaniel v. Kendrick, 386 S.C. 437, 442, 688 S.E.2d 852, 855 (Ct. App. 2009) (stating the party\r\n  asserting adverse possession must show by clear and convincing evidence of continuous,\r\n  hostile, open, actual, notorious, and exclusive possession); Getsinger v.\r\n    Midlands Orthopaedic Profit Sharing Plan, 327 S.C. 424, 430, 489 S.E.2d\r\n  223, 226 (Ct. App. 1997) (stating occasional and temporary use or occupation\r\n  does not constitute adverse possession); Jones v. Leagan, 384 S.C. 1,\r\n  13-14, 681 S.E.2d 6, 13 (Ct. App. 2009) (stating while the legal owner need not\r\n  have actual knowledge the claimant is claiming property adversely, the hostile\r\n  possession should be so notorious that the legal owner by ordinary diligence\r\n  should have known of it); Clark v. Hargrave, 323 S.C. 84, 87, 473 S.E.2d\r\n  474, 476-77 (Ct. App. 1996) (stating that although &quot;color of title draws\r\n  the constructive possession of the whole premises to the actual possession of a\r\n  part only, and is evidence of the extent of the possession claimed, it is not\r\n  of itself evidence of adverse possession, and it does not follow that adverse\r\n  possession can be proved by less evidence when the entry is under color of\r\n  title than when it is not&quot;).  \r\nAs to Brown's argument the\r\n  trial court erred in failing to find that his property was upon the properties\r\n  of the defendants who failed to make any objection or appearance:  Wilder\r\n    Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (&quot;It is\r\n  axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must\r\n  have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for\r\n  appellate review.&quot;); Noisette v.

Keefer, of Moncks Corner, for\r\n          Guardian ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Sarah\r\n  F. (Mother) appeals the family court's termination of her parental rights to two\r\n  of her minor children (the Children).  The family court found clear and\r\n  convincing evidence supported termination of Mother's parental rights on the\r\n  grounds that the Children were in foster care for fifteen of the last\r\n  twenty-two months, Mother failed to support the Children, Mother failed to\r\n  remedy the conditions that caused removal, and Mother has a diagnosable\r\n  condition that was unlikely to change in a reasonable time.  Mother argues the\r\n  family court erred in terminating her parental rights when the Department of\r\n  Social Services (DSS) failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence the\r\n  grounds for termination of parental rights (TPR) and that TPR was in the\r\n  Children's best interest.  We affirm.\r\nThe grounds for TPR must be\r\n  proven by clear and convincing evidence.  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v.\r\n    Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999).  &quot;Upon\r\n  review, the appellate court may make its own finding from the record as to\r\n  whether clear and convincing evidence supports the termination [of parental\r\n  rights].&quot;  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 609,\r\n  582 S.E.2d 419, 423 (2003).  However, despite our broad scope of review, this\r\n  court is not required to disregard the findings of &quot;the family court, who\r\n  saw and heard the witnesses, [and] was in a better position to evaluate their\r\n  credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.&quot;  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).  The family court may order TPR upon finding one or more of eleven\r\n  statutory grounds is met and TPR is in the child's best interests.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2570 (Supp. 2011).  &quot;[T]he\r\n  best interests of the children are the paramount consideration.&quot;  S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Smith, 343 S.C. 129, 133, 538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2000).  &quot;The interests of the child shall\r\n  prevail if the child's interest and the parental rights conflict.&quot;  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. § 63-7-2620 (2010).\r\nMother did provide\r\n  intermittent material support for the Children, but the record shows Mother did\r\n  not make any support contributions in the six-month period between March 2008\r\n  and October 2008 or the year between February 2009 and February 2010.  During\r\n  this time, Mother was employed and able to make some minimal contribution to\r\n  support the Children.  Moreover, an additional statutory ground for TPR was met\r\n  because the Children have been in foster care for fifteen of the most recent\r\n  twenty-two months.  The record contains significant testimony, especially from\r\n  the Children's guardian ad litem and DSS caseworker, TPR was in the Children's\r\n  best interest.  Furthermore, the Children are together in a pre-adoptive home\r\n  and the record shows they are thriving.  Accordingly, we agree TPR is in the\r\n  Children's best interests.  The family court may order TPR upon finding one or\r\n  more of eleven statutory grounds is satisfied and also finding TPR is in the\r\n  best interest of the child.  S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2570 (Supp. 2011).  Based on\r\n  the foregoing, we affirm the family court's order terminating Mother's parental\r\n  rights.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nPIEPER, KONDUROS, and\r\n  GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-276","title":"Regions Bank v.

McIntosh, Senior Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley\r\n          W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Matthew J. Friedman, and Assistant Attorney\r\n          General J. Rutledge Johnson, all of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n        Appellate Defender Kathrine H. Hudgins, of\r\n          Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this post-conviction relief (PCR) action, the State\r\n  appeals the PCR court's granting of a new trial to Respondent Antonio Bordeaux\r\n  on two first-degree burglary charges. The State argues Bordeaux pled guilty to\r\n  these charges, and, therefore, it challenges the PCR court's conclusion that\r\n  Bordeaux's sentences were illegal because they exceeded the maximum penalty for\r\n  second-degree burglary. We reverse and remand.\r\n&quot;'[A]ny\r\n  evidence' of probative value is sufficient to\r\n  uphold the PCR judge's findings.&quot; Cherry\r\n    v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989) (citation omitted). However, reversal is appropriate when the\r\n  PCR court's decision is controlled by an error of law.  Suber v. State,\r\n  371 S.C. 554, 558-59, 640 S.E.2d 884, 886 (2007).\r\nIn the present case, Bordeaux was indicted for two\r\n  counts of first-degree burglary. He was also indicted for two counts of armed\r\n  robbery and one count of murder.  The plea transcript indicates that the State had agreed to a dismissal of the murder\r\n  charge and a cap of twenty-five years of imprisonment in exchange for Bordeaux's plea of guilty to two counts of first-degree\r\n  burglary and two counts of armed robbery. The sentencing sheets indicate that\r\n  the plea court sentenced Bordeaux to twenty-four years for each count of armed\r\n  robbery and twenty-five years for each count of first-degree burglary, with all\r\n  sentences to run concurrently. \r\nHowever, each sentencing sheet for the respective burglary\r\n  offenses contained internally inconsistent information as to whether Bordeaux had\r\n  pled guilty to first-degree burglary or second-degree burglary. Bordeaux\r\n  alleged in his PCR application that his sentence for twenty-five years was\r\n  illegal because he pled guilty to second-degree burglary and the twenty-five-year\r\n  sentence exceeds the maximum sentence for second-degree burglary. Bordeaux\r\n  also claimed that plea counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the\r\n  sentence.\r\nAt the PCR hearing, plea counsel testified that he did\r\n  not object to the sentences imposed because they were &quot;within the\r\n  negotiation.&quot; He explained: &quot;We had negotiated for a cap of twenty-five\r\n  years . . . .&quot; Further, the PCR court specifically found that plea counsel\r\n  was not ineffective for failing to object to Bordeaux's sentence because\r\n  Bordeaux pled guilty to first-degree burglary. However, the PCR court also concluded\r\n  that the twenty-five-year sentence was illegal because it exceeded the maximum\r\n  sentence for second-degree burglary. In reaching this conclusion, the PCR\r\n  court ruled that the sentencing sheets took precedence over the plea transcript because &quot;a sentencing\r\n  sheet is essentially a contract between the applicant, the applicant's trial\r\n  counsel, and the court.&quot; \r\nWe are unable to reconcile the PCR court's\r\n  finding that Bordeaux pled guilty to first-degree\r\n  burglary with its subsequent\r\n  conclusion that the twenty-five-year sentence\r\n  was illegal because it exceeded the maximum sentence for second-degree\r\n  burglary. The PCR court based its conclusion that plea counsel was not\r\n  ineffective for failing to object to Bordeaux's sentence on the finding that\r\n  Bordeaux pled guilty to first-degree burglary. If Bordeaux pled guilty to first-degree\r\n  burglary, then his sentence was not illegal. On the other hand, if Bordeaux\r\n  pled guilty to second-degree burglary, as the PCR court implied when it\r\n  concluded the sentence was illegal, then plea counsel would have been\r\n  ineffective for failing to object to an illegal sentence. Therefore, it is\r\n  necessary to remand this case to the PCR court for clarification as to the\r\n  offenses to which Bordeaux pled guilty. \r\nFurther, in the absence of any challenge to the integrity of the plea\r\n  transcript, the PCR court committed an error of law in ruling that the\r\n  sentencing sheets took precedence over the plea transcript because &quot;a\r\n  sentencing sheet is essentially a contract between the applicant, the\r\n  applicant's trial counsel, and the court.&quot;  See Anderson v. State, 342 S.C. 54, 57, 535 S.E.2d 649, 650&nbsp;(2000) (&quot;When determining issues relating to guilty pleas, the Court\r\n  will consider the entire record, including the transcript of the guilty\r\n  plea, and the evidence presented at the PCR hearing.&quot; (emphasis added)). Given the sanctity\r\n  with which statements given under oath are regarded,[1] we decline to lend credence to any\r\n  position that would favor ambiguous sentencing sheets over an unambiguous plea\r\n  transcript whose integrity has not been called into question. Therefore, on\r\n  remand, the PCR court must give appropriate weight to the plea transcript in\r\n  determining the offenses to which Bordeaux pled guilty. \r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nPIEPER,\r\n  KONDUROS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See Blackledge v.

Walter Wilkins, III, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Jacob\r\n  Mark Breda appeals his conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine\r\n  base, arguing the circuit court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict\r\n  because the State failed to present substantial circumstantial evidence of the\r\n  intent to distribute. We reverse and remand for a new trial. \r\nAn appellate court reviews\r\n  the denial of a directed verdict by viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences\r\n  to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the State. State v.\r\n    Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006). &quot;If there is\r\n  any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably\r\n  tending to prove the guilt of the accused, [an appellate court] must find the\r\n  case was properly submitted to the jury.&quot; Id. at 292-93, 625\r\n  S.E.2d at 648. The circuit court may not consider the weight of the evidence. Id. at 292, 625 S.E.2d at 648. However, &quot;when the [circumstantial]\r\n  evidence presented merely raises a suspicion of guilt,&quot; the circuit court\r\n  should direct a verdict in favor of the accused. State v. Bostick, 392\r\n  S.C. 134, 142, 708 S.E.2d 774, 778 (2011) (citing State v. Cherry, 361\r\n  S.C. 588, 594, 606 S.E.2d 475, 478 (2004)). A mere suspicion is a belief that\r\n  is inspired by &quot;facts or circumstances which do not amount to\r\n  proof.&quot; State v. Lollis, 343 S.C. 580, 584, 541 S.E.2d 254, 256\r\n  (2001).\r\nThe possession of one gram or\r\n  more of cocaine base is prima facie evidence of an intent to distribute. S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(B) (Supp. 2011). In cases involving less than one gram\r\n  of cocaine base, the State must present sufficient evidence the accused\r\n  intended to distribute the cocaine base in his possession. Id. \r\n  Otherwise, the evidence only supports a charge of simple possession. S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(A) (Supp. 2011). Intent can be proven, and ordinarily is\r\n  proven, by circumstantial evidence. State v. Tuckness, 257 S.C. 295,\r\n  299, 185 S.E.2d 607, 608 (1971).\r\nThe facts of State v.\r\n  James, 362 S.C. 557, 608 S.E.2d 455\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004), are strikingly similar to the facts here. In James,\r\n  the accused was arrested in a high narcotics trafficking area for an open\r\n  container violation and a search revealed two Ziploc bags: one empty and one\r\n  containing eight to ten rocks of crack cocaine. Id. at 559, 563, 608\r\n  S.E.2d at 456, 458. When the officer discovered the drugs, the accused\r\n  struggled, broke free, took the bag containing the drugs, and fled. Id. at 559, 608 S.E.2d at 456.  The empty bag ultimately tested positive for crack\r\n  cocaine residue. Id. At trial, the police officer testified dealers\r\n  usually sell one bag completely before selling from another and that they carry\r\n  a large number of rocks in a single bag. Id. at 559-60, 608 S.E.2d at\r\n  456. He explained users only carry one rock and have &quot;a distinct,\r\n  unhealthy physical appearance.&quot; Id. at 560, 608 S.E.2d at 456. \r\n  The accused, he said, appeared in good health. Id. Finally, the\r\n  accused only had $37 on his person. Id. at 565, 608 S.E.2d at 459.\r\nThe James court distinguished\r\n  its facts from State v. Robinson, 344 S.C. 220, 222, 543 S.E.2d 249, 250\r\n  (Ct. App. 2001), and State v. Cherry, 348 S.C. 281, 284, 559 S.E.2d 297,\r\n  298 (Ct. App. 2001), aff'd in result, 361 S.C. 588, 606 S.E.2d 475\r\n  (2004). James, 362 S.C. at 563-65, 608 S.E.2d at 458-59. It put weight\r\n  on the fact there was no evidence of a drug transaction, as in Robinson,\r\n  or large amounts of cash, as in Cherry. Id. at 564-65, 608\r\n  S.E.2d at 459. Moreover, it found the police officer's testimony as to the\r\n  amount of rocks speculative because they were never recovered. Id. at 565,\r\n  608 S.E.2d at 459. Finally, the James court declined to consider the\r\n  accused's appearance, reasoning &quot;it could also have raised the inference\r\n  that he was not a long-term user of crack cocaine.&quot; Id. \r\n  Accordingly, it held the State failed to present substantial circumstantial\r\n  evidence the accused intended to distribute the drugs in his possession. Id.\r\nHere, evidence\r\n  exists showing Breda was found in an area of high drug activity, walking away\r\n  from a residence known for its drug activity. A search incident to Breda's\r\n  arrest for providing a false address revealed four individually-wrapped rocks\r\n  of crack cocaine totaling a weight of 0.31 grams. He carried no drug\r\n  paraphernalia and did not appear high, and no evidence was presented showing he\r\n  had any money in his possession. Finally, Breda made several statements\r\n  denying the substance was crack cocaine and also asked law enforcement why he,\r\n  a white man, would be selling crack cocaine in a predominantly African-American\r\n  neighborhood.\r\nConsidering James,\r\n  we find the evidence presented by the State merely created a suspicion Breda\r\n  intended to distribute the crack cocaine in his possession. The most\r\n  significant circumstantial evidence presented by the State was Breda's\r\n  possession of four individually-wrapped rocks of crack cocaine. However, the\r\n  State failed to present evidence explaining why this evidence was especially\r\n  significant. No witness testified that the possession of four rocks exceeded\r\n  the quantity generally possessed by a mere user, evidence that was presented to\r\n  the jury in James, in which the accused possessed eight to ten rocks. No\r\n  witness testified the individual wrappings indicated the rocks had been\r\n  prepared for distribution. Moreover, we find Breda's utterances to law\r\n  enforcement are no more probative of guilt than was the flight of the accused\r\n  in James. Accordingly, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nWILLIAMS and\r\n  LOCKEMY, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-286","title":"Rainwater v.

As to the standard\r\n  of review: Rule 56(c), SCRCP (providing summary judgment is appropriate if\r\n  &quot;there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the moving\r\n  party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law&quot;); Doe v.

Milliken &amp; Co.,\r\n  305 S.C. 118, 122, 406 S.E.2d 358, 360 (1991) (stating a claimant in a\r\n  retaliatory discharge action has the burden of proof); id. (&quot;The\r\n  employee may succeed [in carrying the burden of proof], either directly by\r\n  persuading the court that the discharge was significantly motivated by\r\n  retaliation for her exercise of statutory rights, or indirectly by showing that\r\n  the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.&quot; (quoting Buckner\r\n    v.

Collins, 366 S.C. 204, 223, 621\r\n  S.E.2d 368, 377 (Ct.

Richardson Wieters, of\r\n  Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nFEW, C.J.: Douglas\r\n  Lambrecht appeals the circuit court's decision to deny his motion for sanctions\r\n  under Rule 11, SCRCP, and sections 15-36-10(C)(1)(a) and -10(C)(1)(c) of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011).[1] \r\n  Lambrecht alleged Deborah Clegg's pursuit of a negligent entrustment action\r\n  against him was frivolous and unwarranted under South Carolina law.  Pursuant\r\n  to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, we affirm the circuit court's decision to deny the\r\n  motions.\r\nA motion for sanctions under Rule 11 or the amended Frivolous\r\n  Proceedings Act is an equitable action and therefore, on appeal, this court\r\n  finds facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.  Se. Site Prep, LLC v. Atl. Coast Builders &amp; Contractors, LLC,\r\n  394 S.C. 97, 104, 713 S.E.2d 650, 653 (Ct. App. 2011).  The circuit court made\r\n  detailed findings of fact in its order denying Lambrecht's motions.  After a\r\n  complete review of the record and taking our own view of the preponderance of\r\n  the evidence, we make the same findings of fact.[2]\r\nA party seeking sanctions under the Frivolous Proceedings Act must\r\n  prove &quot;a reasonable attorney in the same circumstances would believe\r\n  that&quot;: (1) &quot;under the facts, his claim or defense was clearly not\r\n    warranted under existing law and that a good faith or reasonable argument\r\n  did not exist for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing\r\n  law&quot;; or (2) &quot;the case or defense was frivolous as not reasonably\r\n  founded in fact.&quot;  S.C. Code Ann. §§ 15-36-10(C)(1)(a), (c) (emphases\r\n  added).  \r\nA party seeking sanctions under Rule 11 must prove an attorney\r\n  signed a pleading or motion &quot;to cause delay or when no good grounds exist\r\n  to support the filing.&quot;  Ex parte Bon Secours-St. Francis Xavier Hosp.,\r\n    Inc., 393 S.C. 590, 597, 713 S.E.2d 624, 628 (2011); Rule 11, SCRCP\r\n  (stating an attorney's signature on a pleading or motion certifies &quot;that he\r\n  has read the pleading, motion or other paper; that to the best of his\r\n  knowledge, information and belief there is good ground to support it; and that\r\n  it is not interposed for delay&quot;).\r\nApplying our findings of fact to these standards of proof, we hold\r\n  Lambrecht is not entitled to sanctions.[3] \r\n  Accordingly, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and SHORT, JJ., concur.  \r\n\r\n[1] We apply the amended version of the Frivolous\r\n  Proceedings Act rather than the 2002 version in effect at the time the cause of\r\n  action arose because in a prior unpublished opinion remanding this case, this\r\n  court court found &quot;neither party asserted the prior version applied; thus the\r\n  trial court applied the 2005 version,&quot; and &quot;it has become the law of\r\n  the case.&quot;  Clegg v. Lambrecht, Op. No. 4498 (S.C. Ct. App. filed\r\n  Feb. 5, 2009) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 8 at 68 n.1), withdrawn, substituted,\r\n    and refiled Op. No. 2009-UP-376 (Ct. App. filed June 30, 2009); see also 2005 Act No. 27, §§ 5, 16 (stating the amended version of § 15-36-10 &quot;take[s]\r\n  effect July 1, 2005, and shall only apply to causes of action arising on or\r\n  after that date&quot;).\r\n[2] The only factual finding made by the circuit court\r\n  which we do not make is that the record contains &quot;evidence to support the\r\n  reasonableness (and the good faith) of the allegation that at[] the time of [the]\r\n  fatal wreck Elliott was acting pursuant to instructions from [Douglas] to\r\n  retrieve the Mazda.&quot;  However, our disagreement with the circuit court on\r\n  this point does not change our overall conclusion that Clegg's claim for\r\n  negligent entrustment does not violate the requirements of the Frivolous\r\n  Proceedings Act and Rule 11.\r\n[3] For one example that refutes Lambrecht's argument\r\n  that a reasonable attorney in the same circumstances would believe that under the facts, his claim was clearly\r\n  not warranted, see Nationwide Mutual\r\n    Insurance Co. v. Smith, 376 S.C. 60, 67, 654 S.E.2d 837, 840 (Ct. App.\r\n  2007) (&quot;An automobile insurance policy, like other forms of insurance,\r\n  must be supported by an insurable interest in the named insured.  The insurable\r\n  interest required does not depend upon the named insured having either a legal\r\n  or equitable interest in the property, but it is enough that the insured may\r\n    be held liable for damages to its operation and use.&quot; (internal\r\n  citations and quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-294","title":"Wright v.

Code Ann. § 22-3-20(2) (2007) (&quot;No\r\n  magistrate shall have cognizance of a civil action . . . [w]hen the title to\r\n  real property shall come in question . . . .&quot;).  The magistrate's order did not include a\r\n  finding of who holds title to any real property.  Accordingly, the magistrate's court did\r\n  not violate section 22-3-20(2).\r\n2.  As to\r\n  Franklin's remaining arguments, we hold these issues are not preserved for our\r\n  review.  The circuit court did not specifically rule on these issues, and\r\n  Franklin did not file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion with the circuit court.  See Smith v. NCCI, Inc., 369 S.C. 236, 247-48, 631 S.E.2d 268, 274 (Ct.

Coleman and James K.

(Affirmative), arguing the trial court erred in finding Campos's\r\n  injuries did not arise out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of an uninsured vehicle.  We affirm.[1]\r\n&quot;An appellate court\r\n  reviews the grant of summary judgment under the same standard applied by the\r\n  [trial] court.&quot;  Harbit v. City of Charleston, 382 S.C. 383, 389,\r\n  675 S.E.2d 776, 779 (Ct. App. 2009).  The trial court should grant summary\r\n  judgment &quot;if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\r\n  admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\r\n  genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to\r\n  a judgment as a matter of law.&quot;  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.  &quot;In determining\r\n  whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable\r\n  inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving\r\n  party.&quot;  Harbit, 382 S.C. at 389-90, 675 S.E.2d at 779.  \r\n&quot;An insured is legally\r\n  entitled to recover damages arising out of the 'ownership, maintenance, or use'\r\n  of an uninsured vehicle.&quot;  State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Aytes,\r\n  332 S.C. 30, 33, 503 S.E.2d 744, 745 (1998) (citing S.C. Code Ann. § 38-77-140\r\n  (1989)).  In South Carolina, the following three prong test is used for\r\n  determining when an injury arises out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of\r\n  an uninsured vehicle:  (1) the party seeking coverage must establish a\r\n  connection between the vehicle and the injury; (2) there must exist no act of\r\n  independent significance breaking the causal link; and (3) it must be shown the\r\n  vehicle was being used for transportation at the time of the assault.  Id. \r\n  &quot;The causal connection is established where it can be shown the vehicle\r\n  was an 'active accessory' to the assault[,]&quot; and the injury &quot;must be\r\n  foreseeably identifiable with the normal use of the vehicle.&quot;  Id. at 33, 503 S.E.2d at 745-46.    \r\nHere, Campos, Jorge Luna, Carlos\r\n  Abarca, and other unidentified individuals became involved in a physical\r\n  altercation outside of their vehicles.  The altercation quickly escalated and\r\n  resulted in the shootings of Campos and Luna, which also occurred outside of the\r\n  subject vehicles.  Thus, because there was no evidence the vehicles were active\r\n  accessories to the assault or that Campos's injuries were &quot;foreseeably\r\n  identifiable with the normal use&quot; of the vehicles, no causal connection\r\n  between Campos's injuries and the uninsured vehicles was established.  See id.  Further, even if a causal connection was established, it was broken\r\n  when the assailants exited their vehicles.  Moreover, there was no evidence the\r\n  subject vehicles were being used for transportation at the time of Campos's\r\n  injuries.  \r\nAccordingly, the trial court\r\n  properly granted Affirmative's motion for summary judgment because there was no\r\n  genuine issue of material fact whether Campos's injuries arose out of the\r\n  ownership, maintenance, or use of an uninsured vehicle.  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS, THOMAS, and\r\n  LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-309","title":"State v.

the victim's\r\n  residence or workplace.  Furthermore, Twyman was required to adhere to the\r\n  following conditions: &quot;I shall\r\n  follow the advice and instructions of my agent[,] and I agree to comply with\r\n  any further conditions imposed by the Department or its Agents.&quot;  \r\nUpon his release from prison,\r\n  Twyman moved to a boarding house in Summerville.  One month after Twyman\r\n  entered CSP, he was arrested after he entered an &quot;exclusionary zone&quot;\r\n  surrounding the victim's residence.  Twyman's extended family and the victim\r\n  live in the same vicinity of Ridgeville.  The tracking device alerted Twyman's Probation\r\n  Agent, Christine Debello, to Twyman's presence in the exclusionary zone.  Agent\r\n  Debello immediately issued an arrest warrant and proceeded to Twyman's\r\n  Summerville home, where she arrested him the same day.  Twyman told Agent\r\n  Debello that when the incident occurred, he was a passenger in a car driven by\r\n  his aunt's boyfriend; they had stopped at a house in the proximity of the\r\n  victim's residence.  The tracking device indicated that Twyman had entered the prohibited\r\n  area surrounding the victim's residence at 12:30 in the afternoon, and he had remained\r\n  in the area for approximately eleven minutes.  \r\nIn November 2010, Twyman\r\n  appeared before the circuit court for a CSP revocation hearing.  Twyman's\r\n  arrest warrant stated that he had violated CSP by his &quot;failure to refrain\r\n  from having contact with the victim.&quot;  At the hearing, Agent Debello explained\r\n  that an exclusionary zone of 279.60 yards had been established around the\r\n  victim's residence.  Agent Debello testified that although she had told Twyman to\r\n  stay away from the victim's house, she had not informed him of the radius of\r\n  the exclusionary zone because &quot;he could calculate the area and be right\r\n  outside of the zone, and possibly have contact with the victim.&quot;  Agent Debello\r\n  had instructed Twyman: &quot;You need to stay away from the victim's house—that\r\n  area.  If your family wants to see you to help you out . . . then they need to\r\n  come to Summerville to see you.&quot;  \r\nAgent Debello testified that she\r\n  had verified Twyman did not go to the victim's home; instead, he &quot;was at a\r\n  house in close proximity to the victim's residence.&quot;  Although Twyman\r\n  entered the exclusionary zone, he did not attempt to visit the victim's residence\r\n  or contact the victim.  Twyman had no other CSP violations.  \r\nTwyman's counsel argued that Twyman\r\n  knew he was not to contact the victim or go to the victim's residence. \r\n  However, because Twyman was unaware of the exact location of the exclusionary\r\n  zone, his inadvertent entry into the area was not a &quot;willful&quot;\r\n  violation of CSP.  \r\nFollowing the hearing, the\r\n  circuit court found Twyman had willfully violated a condition of his CSP, and it\r\n  sentenced him to serve one year in prison.  This appeal followed. \r\nISSUE ON APPEAL\r\nDid the circuit court err in\r\n  finding Twyman willfully violated a condition of his CSP when he ventured into\r\n  an exclusionary zone?\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nTwyman contends that because\r\n  he was not aware of the precise location of the exclusionary zone, his entry\r\n  into this zone was not a &quot;willful&quot; violation of the terms of his CSP. \r\n  Accordingly, Twyman asserts the circuit court abused its discretion in finding\r\n  that he willfully violated a condition of CSP.  Twyman argues that his mere\r\n  presence in the prohibited zone was insufficient to support a finding that his\r\n  entry into the zone was a &quot;voluntary and intentional act done in\r\n  consciousness.&quot;  Conversely, the State argues the evidence supports the\r\n  circuit court's finding that Twyman willfully entered the exclusionary zone,\r\n  thereby violating a condition of CSP.  \r\nWhen the Department\r\n  determines that a prisoner has committed a violation warranting revocation of\r\n  CSP, &quot;a probation agent must initiate a proceeding in General Sessions\r\n  Court.  The proceeding must be initiated pursuant to a warrant or a citation\r\n  issued by a probation agent setting forth the violations of [CSP].&quot;  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. § 24-21-560(C) (2007).  \r\nIf the\r\n  court determines that a prisoner has willfully violated a term or condition of [CSP],\r\n  the court may impose any other terms or conditions considered appropriate and\r\n  may continue the prisoner on community supervision, or the court may revoke the\r\n  prisoner's community supervision and impose a sentence of up to one year for\r\n  violation of [CSP].  \r\nId.\r\n&quot;Both the decision of\r\n  whether an alleged violation was willful and the decision of whether to revoke\r\n  community supervision are discretionary.  The trial court will not be reversed\r\n  unless the appellant has shown an abuse of that discretion.&quot;  State v.\r\n    Garrard, 390 S.C. 146, 151, 700 S.E.2d 269, 272 (Ct. App. 2010). \r\n  &quot;Where there is any evidence to support the court's factual findings,\r\n  there is no abuse of discretion.&quot;  Id.\r\nIn Garrard, the\r\n  defendant violated a condition of his CSP when he drove within 1,000 feet of a\r\n  school zone.  Garrard testified that he was unaware that he had entered the\r\n  exclusionary zone.  Id. The circuit court found Garrard's act was not a\r\n  willful violation of CSP, and this court affirmed.  Id.  In affirming\r\n  the circuit court's ruling, this court construed the term &quot;willfully,&quot;\r\n  as used in section 24-21-560(C) of the South Carolina Code, as requiring the\r\n  state to prove either:\r\n\r\n  (1) a\r\n    voluntary and intentional act done with consciousness that the act is a\r\n    violation of a term of the community supervision program, or (2) the voluntary\r\n    and intentional failure to do something known to be required by a term of\r\n    community supervision.\r\n\r\nGarrard, 390 S.C. at 150, 700 S.E.2d at 272.\r\nWe find the court's holding\r\n  in Garrard to be instructive.  Agent Debello acknowledged that Twyman\r\n  was not aware of the specific dimensions of the exclusionary zone around the\r\n  victim's residence.  The State presented no evidence to suggest that Twyman\r\n  knowingly or willfully entered the exclusionary zone, or that he made any\r\n  attempt to contact the victim.  In our view, the agent's instruction &quot;not to\r\n  go near&quot; the victim's residence or workplace was too vague to hold Twyman\r\n  responsible for committing &quot;a\r\n  voluntary and intentional act done with consciousness that the act is a\r\n  violation of a term of the [CSP].&quot;  See\r\n    id.  As a result, we hold that Twyman's mere presence in the exclusionary\r\n  zone—the boundary of which he was unaware—was insufficient to support the\r\n  revocation of CSP. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons,\r\n  the circuit court's order is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nPIEPER,\r\n  KONDUROS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-313","title":"State v.

Mitchell, and Bernard Ferrara, all of North Charleston, for\r\n  Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In \r\n  this civil action, Grand Bees Development, LLC (Developer) contends the trial \r\n  court erred in dismissing the complaint of Developer for lack of subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction and failure to exhaust administrative remedies in a timely \r\n  manner.   Specifically, Developer argues that they could not have exhausted \r\n  their administrative remedies in a timely manner because South Carolina \r\n  Department of Health and Environment Control (DHEC) and the County of \r\n  Charleston (County) did not follow statutory law or the regulations, \r\n  disallowing Developer the opportunity to bring its claim in administrative law \r\n  court (ALC).  We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, \r\n  and the following authorities: \r\n1.&nbsp; As to whether the trial court \r\n  converted the County's and DHEC's motions to dismiss Developer's complaint to a \r\n  motion for summary judgment because it considered matters outside the \r\n  pleadings, we affirm the trial court's decision to grant the motions to \r\n  dismiss.  See Great Games, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 339 \r\n  S.C. 79, 82 n.5, 529 S.E.2d 6, 7 n.5 (2000) (holding that the failure of a \r\n  party to comply with the procedural requirements for perfecting an appeal may \r\n  deprive the court of appellate jurisdiction); Posey v. Proper Mold &amp; Eng'g, \r\n    Inc., 378 S.C. 210, 217, 661 S.E.2d 395, 399 (Ct. App. 2008) (finding the \r\n  consideration of affidavits on a question of law in a jurisdictional motion \r\n  does not convert the motion into one for summary judgment) (citing Baird v. \r\n    Charleston Cnty., 333 S.C. 519, 528, 511 S.E.2d 69, 74 (1999)). \r\n2.&nbsp; As to whether Developer was simply \r\n  time barred from bringing its claims pursuant to section 44-1-60(E) of the \r\n  South Carolina Code, thus, removing the trial court's appellate jurisdiction, we \r\n  affirm the trial court.  See S.C. Code Ann. § 44-1-60(E) (Supp. 2008) (&quot;The \r\n  department decision becomes the final agency decision fifteen days after notice \r\n  of the department decision has been mailed to the applicant, unless a written \r\n  request for final review is filed with the department by the applicant, \r\n  permittee, licensee, or affected person.&quot;)[1]; see also Great Games, Inc., 339 S.C. at 82 n.5, 529 S.E.2d at 7 \r\n  n.5; Allison v.

McAllister Towing of \r\n    Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling an \r\n  appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a \r\n  prior issue is dispositive of the appeal). \r\n4.&nbsp; As to whether the trial court \r\n  erred in dismissing Developer's complaint because an action for declaratory \r\n  judgments is not barred, we affirm the trial court.  See Pressley v. \r\n    Lancaster Cnty., 343 S.C. 696, 705, 542 S.E.2d 366, 370-71 (Ct.

Edward Welmaker, Circuit Court Judge \r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2012-UP-315 \r\nHeard April 10, 2012 – Filed May 23, 2012    \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAppellate Defender Lanelle Cantey Durant, of Columbia, for\r\n  Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Alan Wilson, Chief Deputy Attorney General John\r\n  W. McIntosh, Senior Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott,\r\n  Assistant Attorney General Mark R. Farthing, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  Kevin \r\n  Tijuan Hardy was indicted for and convicted of trafficking in cocaine and crack \r\n  cocaine and sentenced to twenty-five years and seven years, respectively.  \r\n  Hardy appeals, asserting the trial court erred in (1) denying his motion to \r\n  suppress the drug evidence resulting from a traffic stop, and (2) allowing the \r\n  State to present a factor to support reasonable suspicion to search that was \r\n  discriminatory and violated the Equal Protection Clause.  We affirm. \r\n1.&nbsp; We find no error in \r\n  the trial court's denial of Hardy's motion to suppress the drug evidence based \r\n  on his assertion the search of his car exceeded the scope of the traffic stop.  \r\n  We find this case to be similar to that of State v. Provet, 391 S.C. \r\n  494, 706 S.E.2d 513 (Ct. App. 2011), and State v. Wallace, 392 S.C. 47, 707 S.E.2d 451 (Ct. App. 2011), and distinguishable from State v. Tindall, 388 S.C. 518, 698 S.E.2d 203 (2010).  Here, as in Provet, the traffic stop was not \r\n  prolonged for questioning by the officer after the purpose of the traffic stop \r\n  had been accomplished.  Rather, the officer's series of questions and \r\n  observations occurred prior to the conclusion of the traffic stop, as the \r\n  officer was still waiting to hear from dispatch regarding Hardy's license and \r\n  registration.  After the officer completed the warning citation, dispatch \r\n  reported back to him on the license and registration, and he explained the \r\n  warning citation to Hardy and handed him the ticket, immediately asking Hardy \r\n  for consent to search.  Here, as in Provet, the officer did not prolong \r\n  the stop several minutes to ask further questions after the purpose of the stop \r\n  was met.  Further, as in Provet and Wallace, the officer here developed his reasonable suspicion as a \r\n  result of additional factors that were not present in Tindall.  While \r\n  the factors noted by the officer here, standing alone, may be insufficient to \r\n  support reasonable suspicion, when considered together under the totality of \r\n  the circumstances, they were sufficient to provide reasonable suspicion for the \r\n  officer to detain Hardy while the drug detection canine walked around his \r\n  vehicle.  See Wallace, 392 S.C. at 55, 707 S.E.2d at 455 (holding \r\n  that while none of the fourteen factors relied upon by the State to support \r\n  reasonable suspicion independently amounted to reasonable suspicion of criminal \r\n  activity, &quot;blending each of [the] 'tiles' into the 'entire mosaic' of the \r\n  totality of the circumstances,&quot; the officer had reasonable suspicion to \r\n  detain appellant while he walked the drug dog around the car).  Finally, as in Provet and Wallace, the officer here was a highly experienced officer, having \r\n  worked as a highway patrolman for a number of years, many of those years \r\n  assigned to the Aggressive Criminal Enforcement (ACE) unit, and having taught \r\n  criminal patrol and interdiction both at the state and national level.[1]  See Wallace, 392 S.C. at 52, 707 S.E.2d at 453 (noting that where \r\n  evidence showed officer involved was experienced, having worked in law enforcement \r\n  for over ten years prior to Wallace's arrest during which time he was \r\n  continually trained in drugs and drug interdiction, and officer's testimony \r\n  described in detail what happened, what he observed, and the conclusions he \r\n  drew from those facts in suppression hearing, considering such testimony and \r\n  the totality of the circumstances of the case, the evidence supported the trial \r\n  judge's ruling that the officer's suspicion was reasonable under the Fourth \r\n  Amendment); Provet, 391 S.C. at 506, 706 S.E.2d at 519-20 (observing \r\n  officer involved in that matter had four years of experience as a member of the \r\n  ACE unit and finding, based on the totality of circumstances and particularly \r\n  considering the officer's experience, there was evidence in the record to support \r\n  the trial court's ruling and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding \r\n  reasonable suspicion).   \r\n2.&nbsp; We further find no merit to \r\n  Hardy's contention the trial court erred in &quot;allowing the State to \r\n  present, as one of the factors for reasonable suspicion to search, 'one black \r\n  male driving alone' which was discriminatory and violated the Equal Protection \r\n  Clause of the United States Constitution.&quot;  This issue is not preserved \r\n  for review.  Although Hardy's trial counsel questioned the officer concerning \r\n  consideration of a &quot;black male driving alone&quot; as a factor to support \r\n  reasonable suspicion, Hardy never argued to the trial court that the State had \r\n  presented such a factor or that it should not be allowed to present such a \r\n  factor, never argued to the trial court that such amounted to selective \r\n  enforcement, and never asserted that it was a violation of his right to equal \r\n  protection.  In fact, Hardy raised no objection or motion in regard to this \r\n  matter whatsoever.  See State v. Jennings, 394 S.C. 473, 481-82, \r\n  716 S.E.2d 91, 95 (2011) (holding the rule that for an issue to be properly \r\n  preserved it has to be raised to and ruled on by the trial court also applies \r\n  to constitutional arguments); State v. McKnight, 352 S.C. 635, 646, 576 \r\n  S.E.2d 168, 174 (2003) (noting contention must be raised to and ruled upon by \r\n  trial court to be preserved for appellate review); State v. Haigler, 334 \r\n  S.C. 623, 632, 515 S.E.2d 88, 92 (1999) (noting a constitutional argument is \r\n  not preserved for appeal where the appellant fails to argue the constitutional \r\n  basis for his request at trial).  Further, the officer specifically indicated that \r\n  he did not consider this fact as an indicator of criminal activity.  The \r\n  officer referenced Hardy's race when he was discussing the details of what he \r\n  observed after he stopped Hardy, and his subsequent testimony makes clear that \r\n  this was not included as one of the factors to support reasonable suspicion to \r\n  extend the stop.   \r\nFor \r\n  the foregoing reasons, Hardy's conviction is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n FEW, \r\n  C.J., and HUFF and SHORT, JJ., concur. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n[1] At the time of this incident, the officer in question \r\n  had more than fifteen years of experience as a highway patrolman and a total of \r\n  eighteen years of experience in law enforcement.  After five years of service \r\n  with the Highway Patrol, he was assigned to the ACE unit and was a first-line \r\n  supervisor under the ACE team at the time of this matter.  He completed more \r\n  than 1,000 hours in advanced criminal patrol and interdiction technique in the \r\n  last ten years, was a certified instructor in criminal patrol and extending \r\n  traffic stops with the National Highway Traffic Safety Association, was a \r\n  certified instructor in advanced criminal patrol through the South Carolina \r\n  Criminal Justice Academy, and was a national instructor with the National \r\n  Criminal Enforcement Association. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-316","title":"Zetz v.

Peace, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  Ernest\r\n  Antonio Evans appeals his convictions of conspiracy and shoplifting, third\r\n  offense, arguing the trial court erred in (1) denying his directed verdict\r\n  motion on the conspiracy charge and (2) proceeding with Evans's trial for the\r\n  felony of shoplifting, third offense, when he was indicted for shoplifting in\r\n  violation of section 16-13-110 of the South Carolina Code (2003), which is a\r\n  misdemeanor.  We affirm.[1]\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;We hold the trial court properly\r\n  denied Evans's motion for a directed verdict on the conspiracy charge. \r\n  Criminal conspiracy is defined as &quot;a combination between two or more\r\n  persons for the purpose of accomplishing an unlawful object or lawful object by\r\n  unlawful means.&quot;  S.C. Code Ann. § 16-17-410 (2003).  &quot;The gravamen\r\n  of conspiracy is an agreement or combination.&quot;  State v. Stuckey,\r\n  347 S.C. 484, 502, 556 S.E.2d 403, 412 (Ct. App. 2001).  &quot;However, a\r\n  formal agreement is not necessary to establish a conspiracy, as the conspiracy\r\n  may be proven by circumstantial evidence and the conduct of the parties.&quot;  Id. at 502-03, 556 S.E.2d at 412 (internal quotation marks omitted). \r\n  &quot;What is needed is proof they intended to act together for their shared\r\n  mutual benefit within the scope of the conspiracy charged.&quot;  Id. at\r\n  503, 556 S.E.2d at 412-13 (internal quotation marks and emphases omitted).  In\r\n  making this determination, &quot;[t]he substantive crimes committed in\r\n  furtherance of the conspiracy constitute circumstantial evidence of the\r\n  existence of the conspiracy, its object, and scope.&quot;  State v. Wilson,\r\n  315 S.C. 289, 294, 433 S.E.2d 864, 868 (1993).  In the instant case, sufficient\r\n  evidence supports a finding that Evans and his companion conspired to shoplift\r\n  merchandise from the CVS store in Newberry, and the trial court properly denied\r\n  his directed verdict motion.   See State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279,\r\n  292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006) (holding when ruling on a motion for a directed\r\n  verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of\r\n  evidence, not its weight).\r\n2.&nbsp; We find Evans's argument challenging\r\n  the sufficiency of the indictment for shoplifting is not preserved for appellate\r\n  review.  Our supreme court has &quot;held that the concepts of subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction and sufficiency of an indictment are distinct.&quot;  State v.\r\n    Dickerson, 395 S.C. 101, 119, 716 S.E.2d 895, 905 (2011); see also United\r\n      States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625 (2002) (holding that a defective indictment\r\n  does not deprive a court of jurisdiction).  Accordingly, &quot;if an indictment\r\n  is challenged as insufficient or defective, the defendant must raise that issue\r\n  before the jury is sworn and not afterwards.&quot;  State v. Gentry, 363\r\n  S.C. 93, 101, 610 S.E.2d 494, 499 (2005).  Because Evans did not challenge the\r\n  sufficiency of his indictment at any point during trial and, in fact,\r\n  stipulated that the court &quot;ha[d] jurisdiction over third offense\r\n  [shoplifting,]&quot; his instant argument is not preserved for our review.[2]\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nPIEPER, KONDUROS, and\r\n  GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.  \r\n[2] Further, even if Evans's argument were preserved, we\r\n  would affirm.  See Carter v.

Adams, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  James\r\n  Douglas Tinsley appeals his convictions of possession of a stolen vehicle and\r\n  two counts of receiving stolen goods, arguing the circuit court erred in\r\n  denying his motion for a directed verdict because evidence was presented he\r\n  participated in the actual theft of the stolen property.  We affirm.[1]\r\nAn appellate court reviews\r\n  the denial of a directed verdict by viewing the evidence and all reasonable\r\n  inferences in the light most favorable to the State.  State v. Weston,\r\n  367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006).  &quot;If there is any direct\r\n  evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove\r\n  the guilt of the accused, [an appellate court] must find the case was properly\r\n  submitted to the jury.&quot;  Id. at 292-93, 625 S.E.2d at 648.  The\r\n  circuit court may not consider the weight of the evidence.  Id. at 292,\r\n  625 S.E.2d at 648.\r\nThe offenses of receiving\r\n  stolen goods and receiving, possessing, concealing, selling, or disposing of a\r\n  stolen vehicle closely mirror each other.  S.C. Code Ann. § 16-13-180 (Supp.\r\n  2011); S.C. Code Ann. § 16-21-80 (Supp. 2011).  The elements of both statutes\r\n  are met if the State can show the defendant had possession of the stolen\r\n  property and knowledge the property was stolen.  § 16-13-180(A); § 16-21-80.  Both\r\n  possession and knowledge can be proven by circumstantial evidence.  State v.\r\n    Ballenger, 322 S.C. 196, 199-200, 470 S.E.2d 851, 854 (1996); State v.\r\n      Williams, 350 S.C. 172, 175 n.5, 564 S.E.2d 688, 690 n.5 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nSouth Carolina courts have\r\n  consistently held that a defendant cannot be convicted of both the theft of the\r\n  property and the separate and distinct offense of receiving the stolen\r\n  property.  State v. Hamilton, 172 S.C. 453, 455, 174 S.E. 396, 396\r\n  (1934) (recognizing that a defendant can be charged with both offenses but can\r\n  only be convicted of one); see also State v. McNeil, 314 S.C.\r\n  473, 475, 445 S.E.2d 461, 462 (Ct. App. 1994) (holding that the offense of\r\n  possession of a stolen vehicle is not a lesser-included offense of grand\r\n  larceny).  The question of which offense the defendant is guilty of, however,\r\n  is for the jury to decide if the facts are in dispute.  Hamilton, 172\r\n  S.C. at 455, 174 S.E. at 396 (&quot;While one may be charged in an indictment\r\n  with both of these crimes, he cannot be convicted of both.&quot;).\r\nWe find the circuit court\r\n  properly denied Tinsley's motion for a directed verdict.  The fact that the\r\n  property was stolen was not in dispute, and Tinsley, who sold the property\r\n  substantially under market value, possessed bills of sale falsely indicating he\r\n  was a buyer of the stolen property.  Moreover, his codefendant testified\r\n  Tinsley participated in the scheme, arranged storage units, and knew the\r\n  property was stolen.  Although Tinsley denied knowing the property was stolen when\r\n  he took the witness stand, his strategy evidently was to produce evidence of\r\n  his participation in the larcenies during the State's case-in-chief to preclude\r\n  conviction of the charged offenses.  His cross-examination of his codefendant,\r\n  however, merely created a factual dispute in light of the State's election only\r\n  to prove Tinsley was knowingly in possession of the stolen property.  Thus, in\r\n  a light most favorable to the State, both direct and substantial circumstantial\r\n  evidence support the State's theory, and the circuit court properly submitted\r\n  the charges to the jury.  Accordingly, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nPIEPER, KONDUROS, and\r\n  GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-322","title":"State v.

Falkner Wilkes, for Appellant/Respondent.\r\n        David A. Wilson and Christine Marie Howard, of Greenville, for\r\n          Respondent/Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This\r\n  is a cross-appeal of a divorce and custody decree.  Todd N. Bernson (Husband)\r\n  appeals the award of custody to Sarah M. Bernson (Wife), the visitation awarded\r\n  to him, and the allocation of several debts to him.  Wife cross-appeals,\r\n  arguing the family court erred in refusing to award her attorney's fees and\r\n  costs and in finding she agreed not to relocate with the parties' child outside\r\n  the State of South Carolina without Husband's consent.  We affirm.\r\n1. Husband argued\r\n  the family court erred in granting custody of the parties' child to Wife and\r\n  insufficient visitation to him.  During oral argument before this court,\r\n  however, his attorney stated that Husband's only dissatisfaction with the\r\n  custody and visitation terms was the possibility that Wife could relocate with\r\n  the child outside the State of South Carolina.  In any event, we hold the\r\n  family court acted within its discretion in awarding custody to Wife and in\r\n  setting the visitation terms.  See Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C.\r\n  7, 12, 471 S.E.2d 154, 158 (1996) (&quot;As with child custody, the issue of\r\n  child visitation falls within the discretion of the trial judge, and his\r\n  findings will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.&quot;).  \r\nThe court\r\n  acknowledged Wife's substance abuse problems, but also found she made\r\n  commendable efforts to overcome them, as evidenced by drug tests showing she\r\n  had been drug free for at least two years and her enrollment in a therapy and\r\n  education program.  See Bramlett\r\n    v. Davis, 289 S.C. 85, 87-88, 344 S.E.2d 867, 868-69 (Ct. App. 1986)\r\n  (holding mother's seeking of successful treatment and counseling for her\r\n  previous drug abuse problems was a change of circumstance supporting the\r\n  transfer of custody from the child's paternal grandparents to her).  These findings were supported by the\r\n  guardian ad litem and an employee at the facility where Wife\r\n  sought treatment.  In addition, the record supports the family court's findings\r\n  that Husband had not yet addressed issues raised in a mental health evaluation\r\n  and that Wife was more likely than Husband to promote the child's relationship\r\n  with the other party.  See Peeples v. Peeples, 270 S.C. 116, 117, 241\r\n  S.E.2d 159, 159 (1978) (noting the appellant's emotional instability as a\r\n  factor supporting the custody award to the respondent).  As to Husband's complaint that the\r\n  family court erroneously allowed him only &quot;minimal visitation,&quot; we\r\n  note Husband provided no argument or supporting legal authority.  Furthermore,\r\n  he was granted four weeks of visitation in the summer, and the family court advised\r\n  the parties they could agree on additional visitation beyond what the court\r\n  specified in the divorce decree.\r\n2. We decline to\r\n  address Husband's argument that the family court should not have included as\r\n  marital debts various expenses that Wife allegedly incurred as a result of her\r\n  substance abuse problems and could have been set aside in a bankruptcy action. \r\n  The family court did not rule on the argument that the disputed debts could\r\n  have been set aside in bankruptcy, and Husband did not raise this issue in his\r\n  motion to alter or amend.  See Chastain v. Hiltabidle, 381 S.C.\r\n  508, 515, 673 S.E.2d 826, 829 (Ct. App. 2009) (&quot;When an issue is raised to\r\n  but not ruled upon by the trial court, the issue is preserved for appeal only\r\n  if the party raises the same issue in a Rule 59(e) motion.&quot;).  As to\r\n  Husband's contention that it was unfair to make him responsible for these debts\r\n  because they resulted from Wife's misconduct, Husband did not present evidence\r\n  linking the obligations to Wife's misuse of prescription drugs.  Furthermore, it\r\n  was agreed during oral argument that regardless of their origin, the bills were\r\n  marital debts.  Given these circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion by\r\n  the family court in assigning Husband responsibility for these debts.  See Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 281, 284-85, 709 S.E.2d 650, 651 (2011)\r\n  (stating an equitable division award should be reversed only when the appellant\r\n  shows an abuse of discretion by the family court); Hardy v. Hardy, 311\r\n  S.C. 433, 437, 429 S.E.2d 811, 814 (Ct. App. 1993) (&quot;[B]asically[,] the\r\n  same rules of fairness and equity which apply to the equitable division of\r\n  marital property also apply to the division of marital debts.&quot;).\r\n3. Husband argues\r\n  he should not have been ordered to pay a credit card debt owed to Rooms-To-Go\r\n  for furniture that Wife sold while the case was pending in the family court,\r\n  particularly in view of his allegations that Wife kept the sales proceeds and\r\n  did not pay anything toward the debt.  Husband asserted during the trial that\r\n  Wife admitted to him she sold the furniture.  Husband, however, was\r\n  unable to direct this court to any such admission by Wife on the record or\r\n  other evidence to document this assertion.  We therefore decline to find the\r\n  family court committed reversible error in assigning responsibility for this\r\n  debt to Husband.  See Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 523, 599 S.E.2d\r\n  114, 118 (2004) (stating an appellate court's broad scope of review in a\r\n  domestic relations matter &quot;does not relieve the appealing party of the\r\n  burden of showing the family court committed error&quot;).  \r\n4. Wife contends the family\r\n  court erred in denying her request for attorney's fees and costs, arguing the\r\n  family court's analysis of the factors set forth in E.D.M. v. T.A.M.,\r\n  307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992), was flawed.  We disagree.  The\r\n  family court acted within its discretion in denying both parties' requests for\r\n  attorney's fees and costs.  See Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C.\r\n  412, 415, 368 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1988) (stating the family court has the\r\n  discretion to decide whether or not to grant a party's request for attorney's\r\n  fees).  In its supplemental order, the family court stated it took into account\r\n  the parties' ability to pay an attorney's fee award and determined that after\r\n  including child support obligations and other financial responsibilities of the\r\n  parties, they would have similar ability to pay their own attorney's fees and\r\n  the guardian ad litem fees.  Although, as Wife argued in her brief, Husband may\r\n  be in a better financial condition than she is, by her own admission she was\r\n  voluntarily underemployed when the case went to trial.  The family court also\r\n  considered that each party prevailed on some issues but not on others. \r\n  Although we may differ with the family court's consideration of the fact that\r\n  Husband received temporary custody of the child, there appears to be no dispute\r\n  that the custody issue was close and the change in custody between the temporary\r\n  and final hearings attest to this point.  \r\n5. Wife takes issue with a\r\n  finding in the family court's supplemental order issued after the hearing on\r\n  the parties' cross-motions to alter or amend that she agreed not to move the\r\n  child out of state without Husband's consent.  Wife argues she only agreed to\r\n  Husband's request that he be given sufficient advance notice of her intent to\r\n  move if, in the future, she decided to relocate with the child.  Wife expressed\r\n  concern that the finding in the supplemental order would prevent the family\r\n  court from ever allowing her to relocate with the child unless Husband agreed\r\n  to the move.  We find no error.  In the divorce decree, the family court an\r\n  order prepared by Family Court Judge Alvin D. Johnson, with the exception that\r\n  Husband would have four weeks of visitation in the summer instead of three weeks. \r\n  Among the terms in Judge Johnson's order is the provision that if the custodial\r\n  parent moves greater than fifteen miles from the location at which the child is\r\n  to be picked up for visits, she must still have the child at that location\r\n  until written agreement for another location is obtained or the family court\r\n  orders otherwise.  Under the terms of the divorce decree, as well as South\r\n  Carolina law, Wife may, without Husband's consent, move with the child outside\r\n  the State of South Carolina if she obtains an order from the family court\r\n  allowing the relocation.  See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-3-530(A)(25) (2010)\r\n  (&quot;The family court has exclusive jurisdiction . . . to modify or vacate\r\n  any order issued by the court.&quot;).   \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  THOMAS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-330","title":"State v.
