We find evidence supports the PCR\r\n\ncourt's finding that Petitioner did not knowingly and intelligently waive her right to\r\na direct appeal; accordingly, we grant certiorari and proceed with a review of the\r\ndirect appeal issues pursuant to Davis v. State, 288 S.C. 290, 342 S.E.2d 60 (1986).\r\n\r\nPetitioner appeals her convictions for murder and possession of a firearm during\r\nthe commission of a violent crime, arguing the trial court erred in admitting letters\r\nshe wrote to a witness because the State violated Rule 5, SCRCrimP, by not\r\ndisclosing the letters during discovery. We find the State did not have possession\r\nof the letters until after Petitioner's trial was underway, and it turned them over to\r\nPetitioner immediately upon receiving them from the witness. Accordingly, we\r\nfind the State did not violate Rule 5, SCRCrimP, and the trial court properly\r\nadmitted the letters. See State v. McEachern, 399 S.C. 125, 136, 731 S.E.2d 604,\r\n609 (Ct.

Hawthorne Barrett and Julian Kane Allen, both of\r\n        Turner Padget Graham & Laney, P.A., of Columbia and\r\n        Charleston, respectively, for Appellant.\r\n\r\n        Pamela R. Mullis, of Mullis Law Firm, P.A., of\r\n        Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: In this automotive accident case, Jose Valle argues the circuit\r\ncourt erred in (1) charging the jury with language from section 56-5-2950(G) of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code (Supp. 2014) (the \"Implied Consent Statute\")1; (2) admitting\r\nthe result of Valle's blood alcohol test; (3) allowing the investigating officer to\r\ntestify; (4) failing to grant a new trial absolute, a new trial nisi remittitur, or a new\r\ntrial pursuant to the thirteenth juror doctrine; and (5) failing to strike or reduce the\r\npunitive damages award. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1.      We find Valle failed to preserve the argument that the Implied Consent\r\nStatute is inapplicable in a negligence case because he did not raise the issue to the\r\ncircuit court. See S.C. Dep't of Transp. v. First Carolina Corp. of S.C., 372 S.C.\r\n295, 301, 641 S.E.2d 903, 907 (2007) (\"It is well settled that an issue may not be\r\nraised for the first time in a post-trial motion.\"); id. (\"Further, it is a litigant's duty\r\nto bring to the court's attention any perceived error, and the failure to do so\r\namounts to a waiver of the alleged error.\"); Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76,\r\n497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (\"It is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the\r\nfirst time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge\r\nto be preserved for appellate review.\").\r\n\r\n2.     We find Valle's counsel admitted Valle was drunk at the time of the accident\r\nand this judicial admission removed the factual dispute of Valle's intoxication from\r\nthe jury's consideration. Accordingly, the admissibility of the result of Valle's\r\nblood alcohol test is no longer at issue. See United States v. Blood, 806 F.2d 1218,\r\n1221 (4th Cir. 1986) (\"Generally, statements by an attorney concerning a matter\r\nwithin his employment may be admissible against the retaining client.\"); id.\r\n(\"Further, a clear and unambiguous admission of fact made by a party's attorney in\r\nan opening statement in a civil or criminal case is binding upon the party.\");\r\nBlack's Law Dictionary 54 (10th ed. 2014) (defining a judicial admission as \"[a]\r\nformal waiver of proof that relieves an opposing party from having to prove the\r\nadmitted fact and bars the party who made the admission from disputing it\");\r\nMeyer v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co., 372 F.3d 261, 264-65 (4th Cir. 2004) (\"Judicial\r\nadmissions are not . . . limited to affirmative statements that a fact exists. They\r\nalso include intentional and unambiguous waivers that release the opposing party\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The circuit court charged the language from the statute prior to its 2008\r\namendment; however, as it pertains to this case, the amendment only redesignated\r\nthe subsections and altered language that is not in dispute.\r\n\nfrom its burden to prove the facts necessary to establish the waived conclusion of\r\nlaw.\").\r\n\r\n3.     We find the circuit court did not err in allowing the investigating officer to\r\ngive an opinion as to the facts of the accident because the officer's testimony did\r\nnot require scientific, technical, or specialized knowledge and was derived from his\r\nobservations at the scene of the accident. See Rule 602, SCRE (\"A witness may\r\nnot testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding\r\nthat the witness has personal knowledge of the matter.\"); Rule 701, SCRE (\"If the\r\nwitness is not testifying as an expert, the witness'[s] testimony in the form of\r\nopinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which (a) are\r\nrationally based on the perception of the witness, (b) are helpful to a clear\r\nunderstanding of the witness'[s] testimony or the determination of a fact in issue,\r\nand (c) do not require special knowledge, skill, experience or training.\"); State v.\r\nDouglas, 380 S.C. 499, 502, 671 S.E.2d 606, 608 (2009) (\"Lay witnesses are\r\npermitted to offer testimony in the form of opinions or inferences if the opinions or\r\ninferences are rationally based on the witnesses' perception[s], and will aid the jury\r\nin understanding testimony, and do not require special knowledge.\").\r\n\r\n4.      We find the circuit court did not err in denying Valle's motions for a new\r\ntrial absolute, a new trial nisi remittitur, or a new trial pursuant to the thirteenth\r\njuror doctrine. The circuit court properly denied Valle's motion for a new trial\r\nbecause this court gives substantial deference to the jury's determination of\r\ndamages, and evidence supports the damages award. See Clark v. S.C. Dep't of\r\nPub. Safety, 353 S.C. 291, 309-10, 578 S.E.2d 16, 25 (Ct. App. 2002), aff'd, 362\r\nS.C. 377, 608 S.E.2d 573 (2005) (\"The denial of a new trial motion is within the\r\ndiscretion of the [circuit] court and, absent an abuse of discretion, it will not be\r\nreversed on appeal.\"); Harrison v. Bevilacqua, 354 S.C. 129, 140, 580 S.E.2d 109,\r\n115 (2003) (\"The jury's determination of damages is entitled to substantial\r\ndeference.\"); Austin v. Specialty Transp. Servs., Inc., 358 S.C. 298, 311, 594\r\nS.E.2d 867, 873 (Ct. App. 2004) (\"[The appellate court's] task in reviewing a\r\ndamages award is not to weigh the evidence, but to determine if there is any\r\nevidence to support the damages award.\"). Additionally, we find the circuit court\r\ndid not err in denying Valle's motion for a new trial nisi remittitur because the\r\nverdict was not excessive and no compelling reasons justified invading the jury's\r\nprovince. See James v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., 371 S.C. 187, 193, 638 S.E.2d 667,\r\n670 (2006) (\"A motion for new trial nisi remittitur asks the [circuit] court to reduce\r\nthe verdict because the verdict is merely excessive.\"); id. (\"The denial of a motion\r\nfor a new trial nisi is within the [circuit] court's discretion and will not be reversed\r\n\non appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\"); Proctor v. Dep't of Health & Envtl.\r\nControl, 368 S.C. 279, 320, 628 S.E.2d 496, 518 (Ct. App. 2006) (\"[C]ompelling\r\nreasons must be given to justify invading the jury's province by granting a new trial\r\nnisi remittitur.\"). Finally, we find the circuit court did not err in denying Valle's\r\nmotion for a new trial absolute pursuant to the thirteenth juror doctrine because\r\nValle was not entitled to a directed verdict at trial. See Parker v. Evening Post\r\nPubl'g Co., 317 S.C. 236, 247, 452 S.E.2d 640, 646 (Ct. App. 1994) (\"[T]o reverse\r\nthe denial of a new trial motion under [the thirteenth juror] doctrine [a reviewing\r\ncourt] must, in essence, conclude that the moving party was entitled to a directed\r\nverdict at trial.\").\r\n\r\n5.     The circuit court did not err in failing to strike or reduce the punitive\r\ndamages award because the damages are supported by evidence of reckless,\r\nwillful, and wanton conduct and the punitive damages award is within the\r\nprocedural and substantive constitutional limitations on such awards. First, we\r\nfind the fact that Valle was driving while intoxicated supports the award of\r\npunitive damages because it is evidence of reckless, willful, and wanton conduct.\r\nSee S.C. Code Ann. § 15-33-135 (Supp. 2013) (\"In any civil action where punitive\r\ndamages are claimed, the plaintiff has the burden of proving such damages by clear\r\nand convincing evidence.\"); Duncan v.

We affirm.\r\n\r\n1.     We affirm as to whether Ellen Jenkins had authority to sign the Arbitration\r\nAgreement on Elizabeth Jones' behalf when Jones was competent at the time she\r\nwas admitted to Heritage, and Jenkins did not possess a health care power of\r\nattorney to sign either contract on Jones' behalf.1 We find the evidence reasonably\r\nsupports the trial court's findings that Jenkins lacked authority to enter into the\r\nArbitration Agreement on Jones' behalf because Jones was competent at the time\r\nof her admission, and Sally Dobson, the admissions director for Heritage, agreed it\r\nwould have been more appropriate for Jones to sign the contract herself because\r\nshe was competent, and Dobson did not know if Jenkins had a power of attorney.\r\nTherefore, we find the Arbitration Agreement is not enforceable against\r\nRespondent. See New Hope Missionary Baptist Church v. Paragon Builders, 379\r\nS.C. 620, 625, 667 S.E.2d 1, 3 (Ct.

We reverse.\r\n\r\n1.      We reverse as to whether the trial court erred in concluding the arbitration\r\nagreement was not governed by the FAA. See Dean v. Heritage Healthcare of\r\nRidgeway, Op. No. 27401 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed June 18, 2014) (Shearouse Adv. Sh.\r\nNo. 24 at 40) (overruling Timms v. Greene, 310 S.C. 469, 427 S.E.2d 642 (1993),\r\nin its entirety, and finding the arbitration agreement involved interstate commerce,\r\nand thus was governed by the FAA).\r\n\r\n2.      We reverse as to whether the trial court erred in refusing to enforce the\r\nparties' Arbitration Agreement in accordance with its plain terms. See Dean at 42\r\n(determining the American Arbitration Association (AAA) arbitral forum was not\r\na material term to the arbitration agreement, and therefore, there was no reason any\r\npotential arbitration proceeding between the parties could not \"follow the rules of\"\r\nthe AAA in a different arbitral forum).\r\n\r\n3.     We reverse as to whether the trial court erred in ruling Heritage waived\r\narbitration. See Dean at 47 (ruling the appellants did not delay in filing their\r\ndemand for arbitration when the appellants participated in the statutorily required\r\nmediation process, and after the respondent filed her formal complaint, moved to\r\ncompel arbitration at their first opportunity).\r\n\n4.     We reverse as to whether the trial court erred in ruling there was no meeting\r\nof the minds between the parties. The trial court found there was no meeting of the\r\nminds as to what the parties were entering into because the admissions director for\r\nHeritage stated during her deposition that she did not know what the Arbitration\r\nAgreement meant. However, Johnson admitted she signed the Arbitration\r\nAgreement without first reading it. See Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648,\r\n663, 582 S.E.2d 432, 440 (Ct. App. 2003) (\"A person who signs a contract or other\r\nwritten document cannot avoid the effect of the document by claiming he did not\r\nread it.\"). Furthermore, the Arbitration Agreement itself states, \"The Resident is\r\nnot required to sign this Arbitration Agreement in order to be admitted to or to\r\nremain in the Facility.\" See Player v. Chandler, 299 S.C. 101, 105, 382 S.E.2d\r\n891, 893 (1989) (\"South Carolina common law requires that, in order to have a\r\nvalid and enforceable contract, there must be a meeting of the minds between the\r\nparties with regard to all essential and material terms of the agreement.\"); id. at\r\n105, 382 S.E.2d at 894 (\"The 'meeting of minds' required to make a contract is not\r\nbased on secret purpose or intention on the part of one of the parties, stored away\r\nin his mind and not brought to the attention of the other party, but must be based\r\non purpose and intention which has been made known or which, from all the\r\ncircumstances, should be known.\").\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the decision of the trial court is\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and SHORT and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-319","title":"State v.

We affirm.\r\n\r\nThe family court may order TPR upon finding one or more statutory ground is\r\nsatisfied and TPR is in the best interest of the children. S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-\r\n2570 (2010 & Supp. 2013). The grounds for TPR must be proven by clear and\r\nconvincing evidence. S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519\r\nS.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999). \"In appeals from the family court, this [c]ourt\r\nreviews factual and legal issues de novo.\" Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C. 412,\r\n414, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011). Although this court reviews the family court's\r\nfindings de novo, we are not required to ignore the fact that the family court, who\r\nsaw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility.\r\nLewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 385, 709 S.E.2d 650, 651-52 (2011).\r\n\r\nI. Statutory Grounds\r\n\r\nAs to Issue 1, even if the family court erred in failing to make an independent\r\nfinding that a statutory ground for TPR was met, we find clear and convincing\r\nevidence supports TPR. A statutory ground for TPR is satisfied when \"[t]he child\r\nhas been in foster care . . . for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months.\" S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 63-7-2570(8) (2010). The DSS caseworker and the children's GAL\r\ntestified the children were in foster care continuously from November 23, 2010,\r\nuntil the date of the TPR hearing, July 13, 2013. During that time, Mother was\r\nconvicted of harboring illegal aliens and aiding and abetting others in harboring\r\nillegal aliens. She was incarcerated until February 2012, and upon her release from\r\nincarceration, she moved to Virginia. In June 2012, Mother was voluntarily\r\ndeported to Mexico. Accordingly, we find clear and convincing evidence\r\n\ndemonstrates the children were in foster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-\r\ntwo months at the time of the TPR hearing.\r\n\r\nWe also find clear and convincing evidence demonstrates Mother willfully failed\r\nto support the children. A statutory ground for TPR is satisfied when \"[t]he child\r\nhas lived outside the home of either parent for a period of six months, and during\r\nthat time the parent has wilfully failed to support the child. Failure to support\r\nmeans that the parent has failed to make a material contribution to the child's care.\"\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2570(4) (2010). \"Material contribution is defined as either\r\nfinancial contributions according to the parent's means or contributions of food,\r\nclothing, shelter, or other necessities for the care of the child according to the\r\nparent's means.\" S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Seegars, 367 S.C. 623, 630, 627\r\nS.E.2d 718, 722 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"[O]ccasionally\r\nproviding [a] child with food, drinks, medicine, diapers, wipes, and toys [will] not\r\nbe considered a material contribution.\" S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. M.R.C.L., 393\r\nS.C. 387, 394, 712 S.E.2d 452, 456 (2011). There is no evidence Mother provided\r\nany support for the children despite the fact she received a monthly income while\r\nworking in Mexico. Therefore, we find clear and convincing evidence\r\ndemonstrates the children lived outside Mother's home for over six months and\r\nMother willfully failed to support them.1\r\n\r\nII. Best Interest\r\n\r\nAs to Issue 2, we find clear and convincing evidence demonstrates TPR is in the\r\nchildren's best interest. \"The purpose of [the TPR statute] is to establish\r\nprocedures for the reasonable and compassionate [TPR] where children are abused,\r\nneglected, or abandoned in order to protect the health and welfare of these children\r\nand make them eligible for adoption . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2510 (2010). In\r\na TPR case, the best interest of the child is the paramount consideration. S.C.\r\nDep't of Soc. Servs. v. Smith, 343 S.C. 129, 133, 538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct. App.\r\n2000). \"The interest[] of the child shall prevail if the child's interest and the\r\nparental rights conflict.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2620 (2010). \"Appellate courts\r\nmust consider the child's perspective, and not the parent's, as the primary concern\r\n\r\n\r\n1Although the family court also ordered TPR because Mother failed to visit the\r\nchildren under section 63-7-2570(3) of the South Carolina Code (2010), we do not\r\nreach that ground because only one statutory ground, along with a finding of best\r\ninterest, is necessary to order TPR. See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2570.\r\n\nwhen determining whether TPR is appropriate.\" S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Sarah\r\nW., 402 S.C. 324, 343, 741 S.E.2d 739, 749-50 (2013). \"The termination of the\r\nlegal relationship between natural parents and a child presents one [of] the most\r\ndifficult issues this [c]ourt is called upon to decide.\" S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v.\r\nCochran, 364 S.C. 621, 626, 614 S.E.2d 642, 645 (2005). \"We exercise great\r\ncaution in reviewing termination proceedings and will conclude termination is\r\nproper only when the evidence clearly and convincingly mandates such a result.\"\r\nId.\r\n\r\nThe DSS caseworker and the children's GAL both testified TPR was in the\r\nchildren's best interest. They stated the children's physical, educational, emotional,\r\nand social needs were being met by the foster family and the children had bonded\r\nwith the foster family. The DSS caseworker and the children's GAL also indicated\r\nthe children identified the foster parents as their mother and father. Conversely,\r\nthe children's GAL testified that when the children were taken into emergency\r\nprotective custody, they had medical problems as a result of Mother's neglect. The\r\nDSS caseworker testified Mother did not represent a safe placement for the\r\nchildren and posed the same risk to the children as she did before they entered\r\nemergency protective custody. She also stated she did not observe a bond between\r\nthe children and Mother during Mother's visits in 2012. Additionally, the record\r\ndemonstrates the children have never met their family members living in Mexico.\r\nTherefore, we find clear and convincing evidence establishes TPR is in the\r\nchildren's best interest.\r\n\r\nIII. Due Process\r\n\r\nAs to Issue 3, we find Mother was afforded due process. \"The fundamental\r\nrequirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and\r\nin a meaningful manner.\" S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Holden, 319 S.C. 72, 78, 459\r\nS.E.2d 846, 849 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"Due process does not\r\nmandate any particular form of procedure. Instead, due process is a flexible\r\nconcept, and the requirements of due process in a particular case are dependent\r\nupon the importance of the interest involved and the circumstances under which\r\nthe deprivation may occur.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\nMother argues she was denied due process when the family court failed to appoint\r\na GAL to represent her. \"A person imprisoned outside [South Carolina] shall\r\nappear by [GAL] in an action by or against [her] . . . .\" Rule 17(c), SCRCP.\r\n\"While the language of Rule 17(c) does not expressly so provide, it is clear from\r\n\napplicable case law that the right to appearance by [GAL] is not absolute.\"\r\nMcCuen v. McCuen, 348 S.C. 179, 182, 558 S.E.2d 926, 928 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\n\"The basis for the appointment of a [GAL] for a prison inmate is not mental\r\ndeficiency, but the physical restraint of imprisonment. Since this is true, an inmate\r\nmay waive the appointment of a [GAL].\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nIn McCuen, this court explained Rule 17(c)'s use of the phrase \"shall appear by\r\n[GAL]\" \"does not signify that a prisoner's right to a [GAL] cannot be waived.\" Id.\r\nat 183-84, 558 S.E.2d at 929. Here, Mother was not incarcerated at the time of the\r\nTPR hearing; instead, she was voluntarily deported to Mexico and was unable to\r\nattend the TPR hearing. As a result, we analyze Mother's right to the appointment\r\nof a GAL as if she was incarcerated outside of South Carolina under Rule 17(c),\r\nSCRCP. Mother never filed a motion in the family court seeking appointment of a\r\nGAL. Additionally, Mother was represented by an attorney at all stages of this\r\ncase, and her attorney cross-examined the State's witnesses and the children's GAL\r\nand introduced evidence on her behalf. Therefore, we find Mother waived her\r\nright to the appointment of a GAL. See id. at 183, 558 S.E.2d at 928 (finding a\r\nwife imprisoned outside of South Carolina waived her right to appointment of a\r\nGAL when she was represented by counsel at all stages of the proceedings and\r\nfailed to move for the appointment of a GAL until the day of the final hearing).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Mother argues she was denied due process when DSS failed to\r\npersonally serve her with the TPR complaint. \"A summons and petition for [TPR]\r\nmust be filed with the court and served on . . . the parents of the child . . . .\" S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 63-7-2550 (Supp. 2013). \"Voluntary appearance by [a] defendant is\r\nequivalent to personal service . . . .\" Rule 4(d), SCRCP. We find Mother's\r\nattorney's voluntary appearances throughout the case and at the TPR hearing\r\nsatisfied the service requirement found in section 63-7-2550.\r\n\r\nIV. Reunification\r\n\r\nAs to Issue 4, \"[i]f the [family] court finds that no ground for termination exists\r\nand the child is in the custody of [DSS], the order denying termination must\r\nspecify a new permanent plan for the child or order a hearing on a new permanent\r\nplan.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2580(B) (2010). \"If the [family] court\r\ndetermines . . . an additional permanency hearing is not needed, the court may\r\norder [] the child returned to the child's parent if the parent has counterclaimed for\r\ncustody and the court determines that the return of the child to the parent would not\r\ncause an unreasonable risk of harm to the child's life, physical health or safety, or\r\nmental well-being.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2580(C)(1) (2010). We find the\r\n\nfamily court erred in stating it could not reunify the children with Mother after the\r\nchildren had been in foster care for eighteen months; however, we conclude the\r\nfamily court's statement did not prejudice Mother because nothing in the record\r\nindicates the family court's decision not to reunify the children with Mother was\r\npredicated on the fact that the children had been in foster care for over eighteen\r\nmonths. Instead, the family court ordered TPR because three statutory grounds for\r\nTPR were satisfied and TPR was in the children's best interest.\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the decision of the family court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.2\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and SHORT and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2   We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-320","title":"Thomas v.

Bagley argues (1) the ALC erred\r\nin failing to find the parole board was required to administer and consider a\r\n\nvalidated individualized risk assessment according to sections 24-21-10(F)(1) and\r\n24-21-5(2) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2013); (2) the parole board erred in\r\nfailing to administer the individualized risk assessment and in failing to consider\r\nall factors required by South Carolina Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon\r\nServices (the Department) policy and section 24-21-640 of the South Carolina\r\nCode (2007 & Supp. 2013); (3) the ALC erred in failing to find the parole board's\r\ndecision was arbitrary and capricious because it considered additional irrelevant\r\nfactors during his parole hearing; (4) the ALC erred in failing to find the lack of a\r\nvalidated individualized risk assessment constituted a failure of substantial\r\nevidence, which the parole board was required to provide in denying his parole; (5)\r\nthe parole board erred in denying his parole twice on the basis of two factors that\r\nhe describes as \"fixed\" as of the date of his offense and unable to be changed by\r\nhis conduct while incarcerated; (6) the ALC erred in failing to find the doctrine of\r\nres judicata barred the parole board's denial; (7) the ALC erred in failing to find the\r\nparole board's denial violated his right to equal protection under the law; and (8)\r\nthe ALC erred in failing to find his parole hearing did not provide adequate due\r\nprocess. We reverse and remand. 1\r\n\r\n1. As to issues one, two, and four: we find the parole board properly considered all\r\nfactors required by Department policy and section 24-21-640 of the South Carolina\r\nCode (2007 & Supp. 2013). However, we find section 24-21-10(F)(1) of the South\r\nCarolina Code (Supp. 2013) requires the parole board to evaluate an inmate's risk\r\nusing the Department's adopted assessment tool in reaching a decision to grant or\r\ndeny parole. See § 24-21-10(F)(1) (\"The [D]epartment must develop a plan that\r\nincludes the . . . establishment of a process for adopting a validated actuarial risk\r\nand needs assessment tool consistent with evidence-based practices and factors that\r\ncontribute to criminal behavior, which the parole board shall use in making parole\r\ndecisions . . . .\" (emphasis added)). Because the ALC failed to make this finding,\r\nits order is affected by an error of law. We therefore reverse and remand to the\r\nparole board for a new parole hearing. The parole board is ordered to evaluate\r\nBagley's risk using the Department's assessment tool and consider the results of the\r\nevaluation in reaching its decision regarding Bagley's parole.2 See James v. S.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n2 In its filings, the Department notified this court that Bagley is currently scheduled\r\nto receive a new parole hearing within the next ninety days. Nothing in this\r\nopinion precludes the parole board from implementing the requirements of our\r\ndecision at the upcoming proceeding, in lieu of holding a separate hearing pursuant\r\n\nDep't of Prob., Parole & Pardon Servs., 377 S.C. 564, 566, 660 S.E.2d 288, 290\r\n(Ct. App. 2008) (\"Section 1-23-610 of the South Carolina Code . . . sets forth the\r\nstandard of review when the court of appeals is sitting in review of a decision by\r\nthe ALC on an appeal from an administrative agency.\"); S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-\r\n610(B) (2005 & Supp. 2013) (\"The court of appeals . . . may reverse or modify the\r\ndecision if the substantive rights of the petitioner have been prejudiced because the\r\nfinding, conclusion, or decision is . . . affected by other error of law . . . . \");\r\nCooper v. S.C. Dep't of Prob., Parole & Pardon Servs., 377 S.C. 489, 499, 661\r\nS.E.2d 106, 112 (2008) (holding an inmate has a state-created liberty interest in\r\nrequiring the parole board to adhere to statutory criteria in rendering a decision).3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto this decision. Because we are reversing Bagley's 2012 denial of parole, we\r\ndirect the parole board not to consider the 2012 denial as a prejudicial factor in\r\nreaching its decision at the upcoming proceeding or in future decisions.\r\n3 The Department argues that under section 1-23-600(D) of the South Carolina\r\nCode (Supp. 2013), the ALC did not have jurisdiction to hear Bagley's appeal. See\r\n§ 1-23-600(D) (\"An administrative law judge shall not hear . . . an appeal involving\r\nthe denial of parole to a potentially eligible inmate by the Department of Probation,\r\nParole and Pardon Services.\"). We disagree. See Howard v. S.C. Dep't of Corr.,\r\n399 S.C. 618, 630, 733 S.E.2d 211, 218 (2012) (\"[A] matter is reviewable by the\r\nALC where an inmate's appeal also implicates a state-created liberty or property\r\ninterest . . . .\"); Cooper, 377 S.C. at 499, 661 S.E.2d at 112 (holding an inmate has\r\nthe right to require the parole board to adhere to statutory requirements in\r\nrendering a decision, and failure by the board to consider the requisite statutory\r\ncriteria constitutes an infringement of a state-created liberty interest and warrants\r\nminimal due process procedures). The Department also argues this case is moot\r\nbecause Bagley is scheduled for another parole hearing in October 2014 and any\r\njudgment in Bagley's favor would not have a practical effect because it would not\r\nbe implemented until after the hearing. See Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 567, 549\r\nS.E.2d 591, 596 (2001) (\"A case becomes moot when judgment, if rendered, will\r\nhave no practical legal effect upon [the] existing controversy.\"). We assume\r\narguendo the Department is correct; however, we find this case is nonetheless\r\nreviewable as capable of repetition but evading review. See Byrd v. Irmo High\r\nSch., 321 S.C. 426, 431, 468 S.E.2d 861, 864 (1996) (\"[A] court can take\r\njurisdiction, despite mootness, if the issue raised is capable of repetition but\r\nevading review.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\r\n\n2. As to issue three, we find the parole board acted within its discretion in\r\nconsidering additional factors beyond those specifically enumerated in its parole\r\nform. We note the parole form allows the board to consider other factors it\r\nconsiders relevant to a particular case, and the enumeration of factors on the form\r\nis not intended to limit the discretion of the parole board. We find no error here.\r\nSee S.C. Code Ann. § 24-21-640 (2007 & Supp. 2013) (directing the parole board\r\nto establish criteria for the granting of parole).\r\n\r\n3. We find issues five through eight were not raised below; thus, they are not\r\npreserved for appellate review. See Brown v. S.C. Dep't of Health & Envtl.\r\nControl, 348 S.C. 507, 519, 560 S.E.2d 410, 417 (2002) (\"[I]ssues not raised to and\r\nruled on by the AL[C] are not preserved for appellate consideration.\"); Risher v.\r\nS.C. Dep't of Health & Envtl. Control, 393 S.C. 198, 208, 712 S.E.2d 428, 433\r\n(2011) (stating when the ALC does not rule on an issue, a party must file a post-\r\nhearing motion requesting a ruling on the issue in order to preserve it for appeal).\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, KONDUROS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-328","title":"SCDSS v.
