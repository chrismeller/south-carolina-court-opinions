Ernest Kinard, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2009-UP-483\r\nHeard September 2, 2009 â€“ Filed October 15, 2009Â Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tCharles Edward Johnson, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tC. Edward Rawl, Jr., and Weston Adams, III, both of\r\n  Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM: Nelson Padgett appeals the circuit court's order granting summary\r\n  judgment in favor of the City of Greenwood (City).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nNelson\r\n  Padgett was arrested and indicted for two counts of armed robbery and possession\r\n  of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime. Â Rhonda Thomas, a\r\n  victim who identified Nelson Padgett from a photo lineup, testified at trial. \r\nThomas stated that on the night of the robbery, she and\r\n  Martez Irvin were traveling on a moped when they were approached by a tan\r\n  Nissan Altima. Â A passenger in the Altima held a gun out of the window\r\n  and told Thomas and Irvin to pull over to the side of the road.Â  Thomas and\r\n  Irvin drove to a nearby house and ran to the porch.Â  Three men exited the Altima.\r\n  Â One of the men took the moped, and the others confronted Thomas and Irvin. Â The\r\n  man who pointed the gun out of the window held the gun to the back of Thomas's\r\n  head and ordered her to disrobe. Â The men also told Irvin to take off his\r\n  clothes. Â The assailants subsequently left in their vehicle, taking Thomas's\r\n  pocketbook and ring. \r\nThomas and Irvin hurried to an apartment complex,\r\n  approached a police officer, and told the officer about the robbery. Â Two\r\n  days later, a detective from the City of Greenwood Police Department (Police\r\n  Department) contacted Thomas and asked her to come to the police station to\r\n  review a photo lineup. Â Thomas identified Nelson Padgett as one of the\r\n  perpetrators. Â She stated she was &quot;very positive&quot; about her\r\n  identification. Â She identified Nelson Padgett as the person who held the gun\r\n  to her head and ordered her to remove her clothes.Â  \r\nDetective Jeremiah Atkins, a police officer who developed Nelson\r\n  Padgett as a suspect, also testified at trial.Â  During direct examination, counsel\r\n  for the State asked Atkins how he developed Nelson Padgett as a suspect. Â Atkins\r\n  explained that Travis Kemp, a victim of a second robbery, identified Samuel\r\n  Padgett as a perpetrator.Â  Atkins then interviewed Samuel Padgett's girlfriend,\r\n  Brandi Wells, and her mother, Vickie Williams.Â  Wells and Williams stated\r\n  Samuel Padgett and three other men visited their residence the night of the\r\n  robberies. Â Either Williams or Wells identified one of the men as Samuel\r\n  Padgett's cousin, &quot;Ned&quot; or &quot;Nelson.&quot; Â Based on their\r\n  statements, Atkins called the Saluda Police Department and discovered that a\r\n  &quot;Nelson Padgett&quot; lived in Saluda. Â Atkins obtained a picture of Nelson\r\n  Padgett from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division and used the picture\r\n  in the photo lineup. Â After Thomas identified Nelson Padgett in the\r\n  photo lineup, Atkins obtained a warrant for his arrest.\r\nWilliams testified for the defense.Â  She stated she never\r\n  told Atkins &quot;Ned&quot; or &quot;Nelson&quot; accompanied Samuel Padgett on\r\n  the night of the robberies. Â She added she never mentioned the name\r\n  &quot;Nelson,&quot; and she does not know a person named &quot;Ned.&quot; \r\nUltimately, a jury found Nelson Padgett not guilty of the\r\n  criminal charges.Â  He subsequently filed this case against the City, the County\r\n  of Greenwood, and Atkins, alleging various state and federal causes of action.Â \r\n  He later dismissed all causes of action against the County of Greenwood and\r\n  Atkins, leaving only an action for false imprisonment against the City.Â  The\r\n  circuit court granted the City summary judgment and this appeal followed.\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nNelson Padgett\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in granting the City's motion for summary\r\n  judgment because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether his\r\n  arrest was supported by probable cause. Â Specifically, he argues only one\r\n  victim identified him from the photo lineup.Â  He also notes testimony was\r\n  conflicting regarding whether Williams told Atkins she saw Samuel Padgett with\r\n  &quot;Ned&quot; or &quot;Nelson&quot; on the night of the robberies.Â  We\r\n  disagree. \r\nIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court\r\n  applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Englert, Inc. v. Netherlands Ins. Co., 315 S.C. 300, 302, 433 S.E.2d\r\n  871, 873 (Ct. App. 1993). Â Pursuant to Rule 56(c), a party is entitled to a\r\n  judgment as a matter of law if the pleadings, depositions, answers to\r\n  interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\r\n  show there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. Â Â In determining\r\n  whether any triable issues of fact exist for summary judgment purposes, the evidence and all the inferences that\r\n  can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most\r\n  favorable to the nonmoving party. Â Law v. S.C. Dep't of Corr., 368 S.C.\r\n  424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648&nbsp;(2006).\r\nFalse imprisonment is &quot;a deprivation of a person's\r\n  liberty without justification.&quot; Â Caldwell v. K-Mart Corp., 306 S.C.\r\n  27, 30, 410 S.E.2d 21, 23 (Ct. App. 1991). Â An action for false imprisonment\r\n  may not be maintained when the plaintiff was arrested by lawful authority. Â Gist\r\n    v. Berkeley County Sheriff's Dep't, 336 S.C. 611, 615, 521 S.E.2d 163, 165\r\n  (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nThe\r\n  fundamental issue in determining the lawfulness of an arrest\r\n  is whether the officer had &quot;probable cause&quot; to make the arrest. Â Id. Â The arrestee has the burden of demonstrating a lack of probable cause. Â Jackson v. City of Abbeville,\r\n  366 S.C. 662, 666, 623 S.E.2d 656, 658&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  &quot;Probable\r\n  cause turns not on the individual's actual guilt or innocence, but on whether\r\n  facts within the officer's knowledge would lead a reasonable person to believe\r\n  the individual arrested was guilty of a crime.&quot; Â Id. Â Although the question of whether probable cause\r\n  exists is ordinarily a jury question, it may be decided as a matter of law when\r\n  the evidence yields but one conclusion. Â Parrott v. Plowden Motor Co.,\r\n  246 S.C. 318, 323, 143 S.E.2d 607, 609 (1965).\r\nAn\r\n  eyewitness identification constitutes sufficient probable cause &quot;unless . .\r\n  . there is an apparent reason for the officer to believe that the eyewitness 'was\r\n  lying, did not accurately describe what he had seen, or was in some fashion\r\n  mistaken regarding his recollection of the confrontation.''' Ahlers v. Schebil, 188 F.3d 365, 370 (6th Cir. 1999)\r\n    (internal citations omitted); see also Torchinsky v. Siwinski, 942\r\n    F.2d 257, 262 (4th Cir. 1991) ([I]t is difficult to imagine how a police\r\n    officer could obtain better evidence of probable cause than an identification .\r\n    . . by a victim, unless, perchance, the officer were to witness the crime\r\n    himself.&quot;).\r\nHere,\r\n  Atkins obtained an arrest warrant after Thomas, a victim, identified Nelson Padgett\r\n  from a photo lineup.Â  This identification alone provided sufficient evidence of\r\n  probable cause unless Atkins had reason to believe Thomas was lying, did not\r\n  accurately describe what she witnessed, or was mistaken regarding her recollection\r\n  of the robbery.Â  Here, the record contains Â no evidence of Thomas's\r\n  unreliability.Â  In fact, Thomas testified she was &quot;very positive&quot; Nelson\r\n  Padgett was the man who robbed her.Â  \r\nNelson Padgett's\r\n  contention that testimony conflicted as to whether Williams told Atkins she saw\r\n  Samuel Padgett with &quot;Ned&quot; or &quot;Nelson&quot; on the night of the\r\n  robberies is without merit.Â  The record reflects the testimony was not\r\n  inconsistent.Â  Atkins testified either Williams or Wells stated &quot;Ned&quot;\r\n  or &quot;Nelson&quot; was with Samuel Padgett on the night of the robberies.Â \r\n  He added, &quot;I know [Wells] for sure said Nelson.&quot; \r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nKONDUROS and LOCKEMY, JJ., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The City also argues it is immune from liability\r\n  under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.Â  Because we are affirming on other\r\n  grounds, we do not address this issue.Â  Futch v. McAllister Towing of\r\n    Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an\r\n  appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a\r\n  prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-484","title":"State v.

Connor (Margaret).Â  They argue the circuit court erred in affirming\r\n    the sale of Margaret's interest in a funeral home business and property, in\r\n    awarding attorney's fees, in refusing to allow Appellants' collateral attack,\r\n    and in failing to recognize Appellants' priority of appointment as Margaret's\r\n    conservators and as personal representatives of her estate.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nAppellants' mother,\r\n  Margaret, experienced a decline in her mental faculties beginning in the late\r\n  1990s and was adjudged incapacitated in 2003.Â  The probate court appointed\r\n  Family Services, Inc. (FSI) as her conservator and Leroy Connor as her\r\n  guardian.Â  In 2004, after Connor transferred some of Margaret's real property\r\n  and money to himself in violation of a court order, the probate court held him\r\n  in contempt and removed him as guardian.Â  In July 2004, FSI petitioned the\r\n  probate court to sell Margaret's interest in the funeral home business and the\r\n  property on which it operated (the Radcliffe property) to Bryan McNeal, who\r\n  already owned a portion of the business, to generate money to pay for\r\n  Margaret's care.[1]Â \r\n  The probate court granted the petition subject to the properties' being\r\n  appraised to establish their values.Â  FSI entered into sales contracts with\r\n  McNeal and hired appraisers to value the funeral home business and the\r\n  Radcliffe property.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  August 4, 2004, Margaret died.Â  On August 24, 2004, the probate court, on its\r\n  own motion, appointed attorney Stephen Slotchiver as special administrator of\r\n  Margaret's estate.Â  The\r\n  probate court noted that it had previously found neither Connor nor Austin was\r\n  capable of serving as either guardian or conservator and concluded a special\r\n  administrator was necessary to protect the estate.Â  The following month, the\r\n  probate court approved FSI's final accounting and discharged FSI as\r\n  conservator.Â  \r\nOn December 20, 2004, the probate court directed Slotchiver to\r\n  conclude the sale of Margaret's interests in the funeral home business and the\r\n  Radcliffe property and to notify Appellants directly of his appointment as\r\n  special administrator of their mother's estate.Â  According to Slotchiver, he\r\n  did so and closed both sales by the end of the month.Â  On January 19, 2005,\r\n  Slotchiver provided copies of the closing documents to Brian Phelan, one of the\r\n  attorneys who purported to represent the Appellants.Â  \r\nIn January 2006, Slotchiver filed with the probate court a\r\n  supplemental inventory and appraisement, a proposal for distribution of estate\r\n  assets, and a final accounting.Â  Through their new counsel, attorney Bernard\r\n  Fielding, Appellants objected to this filing, requested Slotchiver's removal, and\r\n  demanded a hearing.Â  In March 2006, Appellants petitioned the probate court to\r\n  appoint a family friend and Connor's employer, St. Julian S. Matthews, personal\r\n  representative of the estate.Â  In a conference call that included Appellants,\r\n  Slotchiver sought and received the probate court's permission to hire counsel.Â  \r\nThe probate court heard arguments in October 2006 and ruled on\r\n  January 30, 2007.Â  In declining to remove Slotchiver and appoint Matthews in\r\n  his place, the probate court found removal was not in the best interest of the\r\n  estate.Â  The probate court found its prior orders holding Connor in contempt\r\n  for the misuse of estate property, appointing Slotchiver as special\r\n  administrator, and approving the sale of Margaret's interest in the funeral\r\n  home business and the Radcliffe property were all final orders.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  it found Appellants received written notice of the appointment order by\r\n  September 2004 and of the order of sale on December 20, 2004.Â  According to the\r\n  probate court, the evidence clearly indicated that by January 19, 2005,\r\n  Appellants had actual knowledge of all decisions of which they complained, but they\r\n  neither objected nor appealed timely.Â  Consequently, the probate court found it\r\n  lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the merits of Appellants'\r\n  arguments and overruled all of Appellants' objections as time-barred.[2]Â  \r\nAlong with the final estate documents, in January 2006 Slotchiver\r\n  submitted a petition for payment of his fees as special administrator and of\r\n  his attorney's fees.Â  Appellants again objected.Â  On June 6, 2007, the probate\r\n  court overruled Appellants' objections and ordered payment of Slotchiver's and\r\n  his attorney's fees from estate assets.Â  \r\nAppellants appealed both the January 2007 and June 2007 orders to\r\n  the circuit court, which affirmed.Â  This appeal followed. Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAppeals from the probate court are governed by the provisions of\r\n  the Probate Code. Â Matter of Howard, 315 S.C. 356, 360, 434 S.E.2d 254,\r\n  256 (1993). Â The Probate Code provides that a final order or decree of the\r\n  probate court may be appealed to the circuit court.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62&#8209;1&#8209;308\r\n  (2009).Â  Generally, appeal from an order of the circuit court is to the court\r\n  of appeals.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-8-200 (Supp. 2008).Â  \r\nAn issue regarding statutory interpretation is a question of law.Â  Univ. of S. Cal. v. Moran, 365 S.C. 270, 274-75, 617 S.E.2d 135,\r\n  137&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  If the proceeding in the probate court is in the\r\n  nature of an action at law, neither the circuit court nor the appellate court\r\n  may &quot;disturb the probate court's findings of fact unless a review of the\r\n  record discloses there is no evidence to support them.&quot; Â Neely v.\r\n    Thomasson, 365 S.C. 345, 349-50, 618 S.E.2d 884, 886 (2005). Â Likewise, in an equitable matter decided by the\r\n  probate court and affirmed by the circuit court, the &quot;two-judge&quot; rule\r\n  requires an appellate court to uphold the decision of the circuit court if any\r\n  evidence supports it.Â  Dean\r\n    v. Kilgore, 313 S.C. 257,\r\n  259-260, 437 S.E.2d 154, 155 (Ct. App. 1993). Â Nevertheless, the question of subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction may be raised for the first time on appeal, even by the\r\n  court on its own motion. Â Ness v.\r\n    Eckerd Corp., 350 S.C. 399, 402, 566 S.E.2d 193, 195 (Ct. App. 2002). Â Moreover, although a judgment entered by a court without\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction is void, the improper exercise of jurisdiction,\r\n  while decidedly wrong, results in a judgment that is merely voidable and\r\n  must be challenged through direct appeal. Â S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Motor Vehicles v. Holtzclaw, 382 S.C. 344, 351, 675 S.E.2d 756, 759\r\n  (Ct. App. 2009).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\n  of Probate and Circuit Courts\r\nAppellants first appear to argue that because the\r\n  probate court did not comply with the provisions of the Probate Code regarding\r\n  the sale of a decedent's real property in aid of assets, it did not have subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction to order a sale of Margaret's interest in the funeral home.[3] Â Here, during Margaret's life, the probate court appointed a conservator who\r\n  entered into a contract with McNeal, a co-owner of the funeral home, to sell\r\n  Margaret's interest to him. Â The special administrator, the subject of this\r\n  appeal, completed the sale after Margaret's death in accordance with the\r\n  contract that had been approved by the court. Â \r\nThe authority of\r\n  the probate court to appoint conservators is found in Part 4 of the Probate\r\n  Code, entitled &quot;Protection of Property of Persons Under Disability and\r\n  Minors.&quot; Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 62-5-401 to -435 (2009).Â  Section 62-5-408\r\n  provides that, after proper hearing to determine the necessity for the appointment,\r\n  the probate court may appoint a conservator who has all the powers over the\r\n  incompetent's estate, which the incompetent would have if not under disability,\r\n  to include the authority to enter into contracts. Â The contract between the\r\n  conservator and McNeal was approved by the probate court in July 2004. Â \r\nMargaret died on\r\n  August 4, 2004, and Slotchiver was appointed special administrator on August\r\n  24, 2004. Â Thereafter, on December 20, 2004, the probate court authorized the\r\n  special administrator to complete the sale of the funeral home properties to\r\n  McNeal. Â The probate court found in its January 30, 2007, order &quot;[t]hat\r\n  written notice of the Probate Court's Order of August 24, 2004 . . . was\r\n  provided to Mr. Connor and Ms. Austin when Mr. Slotchiver served formal notice\r\n  of his appointment on both Mr. Connor and Ms. Austin on December 20,\r\n  2004.&quot; Â The circuit court concurred in this finding of fact. Â We are thus\r\n  bound by their factual findings. Â See Dean v. Kilgore, 313 S.C. at\r\n  259-260, 437 S.E.2d at 155. Â We therefore conclude the probate court had\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction to decide these issues.Â  \r\nII.Sale of Funeral\r\n  Home Properties; Special Administrator\r\nAppellants\r\n  additionally argue the circuit court erred in failing to find (1) title to the\r\n  funeral home properties passed to Margaret's heirs upon her death; (2) the sale\r\n  of the funeral home properties denied Appellants their constitutional rights to\r\n  due process; (3) a special administrator is equivalent to a personal\r\n  representative; and (4) Appellants enjoyed priority of appointment in\r\n  Margaret's conservatorship and estate.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAn\r\n  unchallenged ruling, &quot;right or wrong, is the law of [the] case and\r\n  requires affirmance.&quot;Â  Buckner v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., 255 S.C.\r\n  159, 161, 177 S.E.2d 544, 544 (1970).Â  Moreover, a party's failure to appeal\r\n  within the time specified by statute deprives the appellate court of\r\n  jurisdiction over the appeal.Â  Gallagher v. Evert, 353 S.C. 59, 68, 577\r\n  S.E.2d 217, 221 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nBoth\r\n  the probate court and the circuit court found the probate court's initial\r\n  orders adjudicating the issues listed above were final and appealable.Â \r\n  Additionally, both the probate and circuit courts found Appellants' challenges\r\n  to those orders were procedurally barred due to Appellants' failure to appeal\r\n  within the time allotted by statute.Â  Those rulings are the law of the case.Â  See\r\n    Buckner, 255 S.C. at 161, 177 S.E.2d at 544.Â  We affirm the circuit court's\r\n  conclusion that appeal of these rulings is untimely and therefore procedurally\r\n  barred.Â  Because these issues are not properly before this court, we decline to\r\n  address the arguments on the merits.Â  \r\nIII. Special\r\n  Administrator's Attorney's Fees\r\nAppellants\r\n  next argue the circuit court erred in affirming the award of attorney's fees to\r\n  Slotchiver's counsel.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAttorney's\r\n  fees incurred by the personal representative in the defense or prosecution of\r\n  estate litigation are reimbursable from estate assets.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  62-3-720 (2009).Â  When an estate's assets are insufficient to pay all claims in\r\n  full, the Probate Code establishes the order in which the claims must be paid.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-805 (2009).Â  &quot;[C]osts and expenses of administration,\r\n  including attorney's fees, and reasonable funeral expenses&quot; must be paid\r\n  before any other claims.Â  Id.Â  However, upon petition by an interested\r\n  person, the probate court may review the reasonableness of compensation of\r\n  persons employed by the estate, including attorneys.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  62-3-721(a) (2009).Â  \r\n\r\n  In\r\n    determining the reasonable time expended and a reasonable hourly rate for\r\n    purposes of calculating attorneys' fees, South Carolina courts have\r\n    historically relied on six common law factors of reasonableness: Â (1) the\r\n    nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to\r\n    the case; (3) the professional standing of counsel; (4) the contingency of\r\n    compensation; (5) the beneficial results obtained; and (6) the customary legal\r\n    fees for similar services. \r\n\r\nLayman v. State, 376 S.C. 434, 458, 658 S.E.2d 320, 333 (2008).\r\nWe\r\n  affirm the circuit court's order approving the special administrator's attorney's\r\n  fees.Â  Although neither the probate court nor the circuit court had discretion\r\n  under section 62-3-805 to order that expenses of estate administration be paid\r\n  after other expenses, as Appellants suggest, the probate court had authority to\r\n  review the reasonableness of the fees charged.Â  Upon Appellants' petition for\r\n  review, both the probate and circuit courts analyzed the fees and found them proper\r\n  under South Carolina law.Â  Both courts found this case presented &quot;novel\r\n  and complex legal issues,&quot; required extensive discovery, and involved a\r\n  three-day trial.Â  See id.Â  Furthermore, the courts found the\r\n  hourly rates and expenses were reasonable and customary, and the work performed\r\n  on the special administrator's behalf benefited the estate.Â  See id.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in affirming the probate court's approval\r\n  of attorney's fees.Â  \r\nIV.Collateral Attack\r\nFinally,\r\n  Appellants argue the circuit court erred in failing to find a collateral attack\r\n  is permissible when the court exceeds its statutory authority.Â  We decline to\r\n  address this issue as it was waived on appeal because Appellants cited to\r\n  authority but made no argument by which this court could discern how they\r\n  believe the circuit court erred.Â  An appellant's brief &quot;shall be divided\r\n  into as many parts as there are issues to be argued.Â  At the head of each part,\r\n  the particular issue to be addressed shall be set forth in distinctive type,\r\n  followed by discussion and citations of authority.&quot;Â  Rule 208(b)(1)(D),\r\n  SCACR.Â  An issue is deemed waived on appeal if it is not argued in the\r\n  appellant's brief.Â  Guinan v. Tenet Healthsystems of Hilton Head, Inc.,\r\n  383 S.C. 48, 54 n.4, 677 S.E.2d 32, 36 n.4 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  Appellants do not\r\n  argue this issue in their brief.Â  Rather, they quote from American\r\n    Jurisprudence, asserting collateral attack is permissible when the court\r\n  has exceeded its authority, without arguing how this premise pertains to their\r\n  case.Â  Appellants do not indicate which lower court allegedly exceeded its\r\n  authority or in what manner it did so. Thus, we find this issue is waived on\r\n  appeal, and we decline to address it.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  hold the probate court had subject matter jurisdiction to order a sale of\r\n  Margaret's interest in the funeral home pursuant to the contract entered by\r\n  Margaret's conservator. Â With regard to the issue of the special\r\n  administrator's attorney's fees, we find Appellants asserted their statutory\r\n  right to judicial review to determine whether the fees billed by the special\r\n  administrator's attorney were reasonable.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the circuit\r\n  court's decision on this issue.\r\nBecause\r\n  the appeal of the issues relating to the sale of the funeral home properties\r\n  and to the appointment of the special administrator was untimely, these issues\r\n  are not properly before this court. Â Therefore, we affirm the circuit court's\r\n  conclusion on this issue and decline to address the merits of Appellants'\r\n  arguments.Â  In addition, we decline to address the issue of collateral attack as\r\n  waived on appeal.Â  Consequently, the order of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKONDUROS\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] By May 2004, Margaret had been diagnosed with stomach\r\n  cancer and required round-the-clock care.Â  \r\n[2] Nevertheless, the probate court's order addressed the\r\n  merits and ruled against Appellants on each issue. \r\n[3] Subject matter jurisdiction is defined as a &quot;court's\r\n  power to hear and determine a particular class of cases.&quot;Â  Whaley v.\r\n    CSX Transp., Inc., 362 S.C. 456, 474, 609 S.E.2d 286, 295 (2005).Â  Appellants\r\n  base their argument upon Part 13 of the Probate Code, which is entitled,\r\n  &quot;Sale of Real Estate by Probate Court to Pay Debts.&quot;Â  The pertinent\r\n  section states:Â  &quot;The provisions of this Part are hereby declared to be\r\n  the only procedure for the sale of lands by the court, except where the will of\r\n  the decedent authorizes to the contrary.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-1301\r\n  (2009).Â  Because the probate court is a statutory court and only has such\r\n  jurisdiction as the Legislature affords it, the section at first blush appears\r\n  to confer subject matter jurisdiction to the probate court to sell real estate\r\n  only in the manner prescribed by that section.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-502","title":"Estate of Connor #2","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayUnPubOpinion.cfm?caseNo=2009-UP-502","description":null,"date":"2009-10-29","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n\t\t<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nP.heading {\r\ntext-align:center\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS OPINION\r\n  HAS NO PRECEDENTIAL VALUE.Â  IT SHOULD NOT BE CITED OR RELIED ON AS PRECEDENT IN\r\n  ANY PROCEEDING EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY RULE 268(d)(2), SCACR.\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Estate\r\n          of: Margaret S.

Connor (Margaret), and directing payment\r\n  from estate assets of fees earned by the special administrator and his\r\n  counsel.Â  Appellants argue the circuit court erred in applying the standard of\r\n  review, authorizing the sale of certain estate assets, denying Appellants'\r\n  claims relating to due process and breach of fiduciary duty, and discerning\r\n  which issues were stayed by Appellants' prior appeal.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellants' mother, Margaret, died August 4, 2004.Â  Shortly after\r\n  her death, the probate court, on its own motion, appointed Stephen Slotchiver\r\n  as special administrator of her estate.Â  In January 2006, Slotchiver filed a\r\n  proposal for distribution of Margaret's estate.Â  Appellants filed a number of\r\n  exceptions that were heard by the probate court in October 2006.Â  Appellants also\r\n  challenged Slotchiver's petition for payment of fees to the special\r\n  administrator and his counsel; the probate court heard these matters in March\r\n  2007.Â  Subsequently, the probate court issued two orders dismissing the\r\n  exceptions.Â  Appellants appealed both orders to the circuit court, which\r\n  affirmed in September 2007, and then appealed to this court.Â  \r\nDuring the pendency of the appeal from the circuit court's\r\n  September 2007 orders, Slotchiver petitioned the probate court for\r\n  authorization to sell some of the estate's real property to pay creditors.Â \r\n  Appellants responded by filing an answer and a motion to dismiss the petition.Â \r\n  About the same time, Slotchiver's counsel petitioned for payment of attorney's\r\n  fees.Â  The probate court denied the motion to dismiss and approved both\r\n  Slotchiver's petition to sell property and his counsel's petitions for payment\r\n  of attorney's fees.Â  Appellants appealed to the circuit court.Â  After hearing\r\n  arguments on April 17, 2008, the circuit court affirmed.Â  This appeal followed\r\n  and was heard contemporaneously with the appeal from the circuit court's\r\n  September 2007 orders.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAppeals from the probate court are governed by the provisions of\r\n  the Probate Code.Â  Matter of Howard, 315 S.C. 356, 360, 434 S.E.2d 254,\r\n  256 (1993).Â  The Probate Code provides that a final order or decree of the\r\n  probate court may be appealed to the circuit court.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62&#8209;1&#8209;308\r\n  (2009).Â  Generally, an appeal from an order of the circuit court is to the\r\n  court of appeals.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-8-200 (Supp. 2008).Â  \r\nAn issue regarding statutory interpretation is a question of law.Â  Univ. of S. Cal. v. Moran, 365 S.C. 270, 274-75, 617 S.E.2d 135,\r\n  137&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  If the proceeding in the probate court is in the\r\n  nature of an action at law, neither the circuit court nor the appellate court\r\n  may &quot;disturb the probate court's findings of fact unless a review of the\r\n  record discloses there is no evidence to support them.&quot;Â  Neely v.\r\n    Thomasson, 365 S.C. 345, 349-50, 618 S.E.2d 884, 886 (2005).Â  Likewise, in an equitable matter decided\r\n  by the probate court and affirmed by the circuit court, the\r\n  &quot;two-judge&quot; rule requires an appellate court to uphold the decision\r\n  of the circuit court if any evidence supports it.Â  Dean v. Kilgore, 313\r\n  S.C. 257, 259-260, 437 S.E.2d 154, 155 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants assert the circuit court erred in failing to find\r\n  Slotchiver was precluded from bringing additional actions in the probate court\r\n  while the validity of his appointment was on appeal.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nService of a notice of appeal deprives the trial court of\r\n  jurisdiction over the matters appealed:Â  \r\n\r\n  Upon the service of the notice of appeal, the appellate court\r\n    shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the appeal; the lower court or administrative\r\n    tribunal shall have jurisdiction to entertain petitions for writs of\r\n    supersedeas as provided by Rule 241.Â  Nothing in these Rules shall prohibit the\r\n    lower court, commission or tribunal from proceeding with matters not affected\r\n    by the appeal.\r\n\r\nRule 205, SCACR.Â  \r\n\r\n  As a general rule, the service of a notice of appeal in a civil\r\n    matter acts to automatically stay matters decided in the order, judgment,\r\n    decree or decision on appeal, and to automatically stay the relief ordered in\r\n    the appealed order, judgment, or decree or decision.Â  This automatic stay\r\n    continues in effect for the duration of the appeal unless lifted by order of\r\n    the lower court, the administrative tribunal, appellate court, or judge or\r\n    justice of the appellate court.Â  The lower court or administrative tribunal\r\n    retains jurisdiction over matters not affected by the appeal including the\r\n    authority to enforce any matters not stayed by the appeal.\r\n\r\nRule 241(a),\r\n  SCACR.Â  &quot;After service of notice of appeal, any party may move [the lower\r\n  court, administrative tribunal, appellate court, or judge or justice of the\r\n  appellate court] for an order lifting the automatic stay.&quot;Â  Rule\r\n  241(c)(1).Â  The supersedeas or lifting of the automatic stay, as well as any\r\n  other affirmative relief granted, may be conditioned on such terms as the\r\n  tribunal, court, judge, or justice entering the order deems appropriate.Â  Rule\r\n  241(c)(3).Â  \r\nWe reverse the circuit court's refusal to dismiss Slotchiver's\r\n  petition to sell real estate as a matter stayed by appeal under Rules 205 and\r\n  241.Â  The circuit court found the validity of Slotchiver's appointment was an\r\n  issue already on appeal, yet went on to find Slotchiver's petition to sell\r\n  estate assets was unaffected by the appeal.Â  We find Slotchiver's authority to\r\n  pursue a petition to sell estate assets derived from and depended entirely upon\r\n  his position as special administrator of Margaret's estate.Â  Because the\r\n  legitimacy of Slotchiver's appointment as special administrator was an issue on\r\n  appeal, Rule 241 imposed an automatic stay on his administration of the\r\n  estate.Â  Thus, the automatic stay prohibited him from performing additional\r\n  administrative duties during the pendency of the appeal.Â  \r\nIn so ruling, we are mindful that suspending the sole\r\n  administrator's authority to manage an estate may grind the gears of the\r\n  probate process to a halt and could expose the estate to liability for unpaid\r\n  accounts, for example, property taxes, that become due during the period of\r\n  suspension.Â  While the suspension may preserve estate assets, it does not\r\n  further the Probate Code's purpose of &quot;promot[ing] a speedy and efficient\r\n  system for liquidating the estate of the decedent and making distribution to\r\n  his successors.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-102(b)(3) (2009).Â  However, an\r\n  automatic stay under Rules 205 and 241 is not unassailable:Â  a party to the\r\n  action need only petition either the trial court or the appellate court for an\r\n  order lifting the stay.Â  See Rule 241.Â  In this matter, Slotchiver could\r\n  have petitioned for a writ of supersedeas under Rule 241.Â  The record does not\r\n  reflect he did so.Â  Because Slotchiver's authority to administer the estate was\r\n  automatically stayed under Rule 241 but he failed to seek an order lifting the\r\n  stay, he lacked authority to submit petitions for court action on behalf of the\r\n  estate.Â  Therefore, the probate court erred in considering the petition to sell\r\n  real estate, and the circuit court erred in affirming the probate court's\r\n  decision.Â  \r\nBecause reversal as to this issue is dispositive of the case, we\r\n  decline to address Appellants' remaining issues.Â  See Futch v.\r\n    McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591,\r\n  598 (1999) (ruling an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a\r\n  prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude the appeal of the validity of the special\r\n  administrator's appointment imposed an automatic stay upon his administration\r\n  of Margaret's estate.Â  Because the special administrator did not obtain a court\r\n  order lifting the automatic stay, it was still in effect when he petitioned to\r\n  sell estate assets.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court's decision\r\n  approving the sale of estate assets and remand this case for further\r\n  proceedings.Â  We do not reach Appellants' remaining issues.Â  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nKONDUROS and LOCKEMY, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
