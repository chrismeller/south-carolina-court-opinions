Wylie, Jr., Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-001\r\nSubmitted November 1, 2006 â€“ Filed January 9, 2007Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nREMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Clarissa Warren Joyner, of Orangeburg, for Appellant.\r\n        Janne Berry Osborne, of Orangeburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Emerald Muhammad (Mother) appeals the family courtâ€™s order awarding custody of her daughter, Fahrah (Child), to Khalid Muhammad (Father).Â  We remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nFather and Mother married on December 28, 2000. Â Prior to their marriage, on July 29, 2000, Father and Mother had a child. Â The Muhammads resided together in Orangeburg, South Carolina until sometime between September and December 31, 2002, when Mother moved with Child to New York. Â The parties dispute when the move occurred, and Father claims he did not know his wife and child were leaving prior to December 31, 2002. \r\nMother and Child lived in New York with Motherâ€™s parents.Â  Child suffers from developmental issues resulting in underdeveloped communication skills. Â Mother enrolled Child in a school with programs designed to assist children with special needs.Â  Child flourished in New York. Â \r\nBoth Father and Mother filed custody actions. Â Father filed in South Carolina on April 17, 2003 and served Mother on December 17, 2003. Mother filed in New York on October 14, 2003.Â  Father was never personally served, but was apparently served by mail in January of 2004.Â  On March 4, 2004, the New York family court issued an order awarding custody to Mother. Â The New York order indicates there was proper service on Father.Â  \r\nOn November 19, 2004, the South Carolina family court issued a final order awarding custody to Father and directing law enforcement to assist in obtaining physical custody of Child.Â  Mother timely filed a motion for reconsideration in the South Carolina family court.Â  In that motion and its attachments, Mother argued the family court lacked jurisdiction to decide the case because New York was Childâ€™s home state, the New York family court issued the initial decree of custody in this matter, and substantial evidence of Childâ€™s present and future care exists in New York.Â  Mother averred the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA) mandates the South Carolina court make an inquiry to the New York family court concerning the simultaneous proceedings in order to avoid relitigation. \r\nEvidence in the record indicates that the parties knew cases had been filed in both New York and South Carolina.Â  Neither the New York family court nor the South Carolina family court was afforded full candor during its proceedings.Â  In fact, it appears the New York family court did not have notice of the South Carolina case prior to issuing its order. Â The South Carolina family court heard of the New York order during the motion to reconsider filed by Mother.\r\nIn an order dated August 18, 2005, the South Carolina family court denied Motherâ€™s motion for reconsideration concluding â€œthat South Carolina was the childâ€™s home state when this action was commenced . . . .â€ Â Child now resides with Father in South Carolina. Â This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, the appellate court has authority to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  This does not require the appellate court, however, to disregard the findings of the family court, which saw and heard the witnesses.Â  Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C 195, 202, 522 S.E.2d 835, 838 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nIn all child custody controversies, the controlling considerations are the childrenâ€™s welfare and best interests.Â  Cook v. Cobb, 271 S.C. 136, 140, 245 S.E.2d 612, 614 (1978).Â  In reaching a determination as to custody, the family court should consider how the custody decision will impact all areas of the childâ€™s life, including physical, psychological, spiritual, educational, familial, emotional, and recreational aspects.Â  Pountain v. Pountain, 332 S.C. 130, 136, 503 S.E.2d 757, 760 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Additionally, the court must assess each partyâ€™s character, fitness, and attitude as they affect the child.Â  Id. at 136, 503 S.E.2d at 760.Â Â  Indeed, â€œthe totality of circumstances peculiar to each case constitutes the only scale upon which the ultimate decision can be weighed.â€Â  Davenport v. Davenport, 265 S.C. 524, 527, 220 S.E.2d 228, 230 (1975).Â Â  \r\nCustody decisions are matters left largely to the discretion of the trial court.Â  Stroman v. Williams, 291 S.C. 376, 378, 353 S.E.2d 704, 705 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs either when the court is controlled by some error of law or where the order, based upon findings of fact, lacks evidentiary support.Â  McKnight v. McKnight, 283 S.C. 540, 543, 324 S.E.2d 91, 93 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMother claims the South Carolina family court did not comply with the UCCJA because it failed to contact the New York family court concerning a simultaneous custody action.Â  We agree.\r\nThe UCCJA provides, in pertinent part that:\r\n\r\n  (a) A court of this State which is competent to decide child custody matters has jurisdiction to make a child custody determination by initial or modification decree if:\r\n      (1) this State (i) is the home state of the child at the time of commencement of the proceeding, or (ii) had been the childâ€™s home state within six months before commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from this State because of his removal or retention by a person claiming his custody or for other reasons, and a parent or person acting as parent continues to live in this State; or Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n  (2) it is in the best interest of the child that a court of this State assume jurisdiction because (i) the child and his parents, or the child and at least one contestant, have a significant connection with this State and (ii) there is available in this State substantial evidence concerning the childâ€™s present or future care, protection, training and personal relationships; orÂ  \r\n  . . . .\r\n   (4) (i) it appears that no other state would have jurisdiction under prerequisites substantially in accordance with paragraphs (1), (2) or (3) of subsection (a), or another state has declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that this State is the more appropriate forum to determine the custody of the child and (ii) it is in the best interest of the child that this court assume jurisdiction.\r\n  (b) Except under paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection (a), physical presence in this State of the child, or of the child and one of the contestants, is not alone sufficient to confer jurisdiction on a court of this State to make a child custody determination.\r\n    (c) Physical presence of the child, while desirable, is not a prerequisite for jurisdiction to determine his custody.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-788 (1976).\r\nFurther, the South Carolina Code instructs family court judges on the proper actions when there is a simultaneous proceeding in another state, namely:\r\n\r\n  (a) A court of this State shall not exercise its jurisdiction under this subarticle if at the time of filing the petition a proceeding concerning the custody of the child was pending in a court of another state exercising jurisdiction substantially in conformity with this subarticle, unless the proceeding is stayed by the court of the other state because this State is a more appropriate forum or for other reasons.\r\n   (b) Before hearing the petition in a custody proceeding the court shall examine the pleadings and other information supplied by the parties under Â§ 20-7-800 and shall consult the child custody registry established under Â§ 20-7-814 concerning the pendency of proceedings with respect to the child in other states. Â If the court has reason to believe that proceedings may be pending in another state it shall direct an inquiry to the state court administrator or other appropriate official of the other state.\r\n   (c) If the court is informed during the course of the proceeding that a proceeding concerning the custody of the child was pending in another state before the court assumed jurisdiction it shall stay the proceeding and communicate with the court in which the other proceeding is pending to the end that the issue may be litigated in the more appropriate forum and that information be exchanged in accordance with Â§Â§ 20-7-820 through 20-7-826. Â If a court of this State has made a custody decree before being informed of a pending proceeding in a court of another state it shall immediately inform that court of the fact. Â If the court is informed that a proceeding was commenced in another state after it assumed jurisdiction it shall likewise inform the other court to the end that the issues may be litigated in the more appropriate forum.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-794 (1976).\r\nWe find the South Carolina family court erred in that it did not contact the New York family court when confronted with evidence that there may be a simultaneous proceeding in that state.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nKeeping in mind the mandates of the UCCJA, we hereby remand to the family court.Â  Upon remand, the family court shall, within forty-five days, make an inquiry to the New York family court to determine the most appropriate forum in accordance with Section 20-7-794 of the South Carolina Code of Laws (1976), and issue an order setting forth with specificity all findings of fact and factors considered in determining the appropriate forum. Â Â This Court does not address Motherâ€™s remaining issues without prejudice so that they may be raised in any subsequent appeal, if necessary.Â  Accordingly, the family courtâ€™s order is\r\nREMANDED. [1]\r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-002","title":"Todd v.

Thomas, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-002\r\nSubmitted December 1, 2006 â€“ Filed January 9, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Ian D. Maguire, Vivien K. Sookram, of Myrtle Beach; for Appellant.\r\n        G. Michael Smith, of Conway; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this civil action, James Randy Todd appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment in favor of James Oâ€™Hara Brereton and VT, Inc. (collectively Brereton). Â Â We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn November 30, 1999, Todd and Brereton were involved in an auto accident.Â  At the time of the accident, Brereton was driving a vehicle owned by VT, Inc.Â  In July 2001, Todd executed a release which provides, in its entirety:\r\n\r\n  For the sole consideration of Five Hundred ($500.00) dollars, the receipt and sufficiency whereof is hereby acknowledged, the undersigned hereby releases and forever discharges James O. Brereton, his heirs, executors, administrators, agents and assigns, and all other persons, firms or corporations liable or, who might be claimed to be liable none of whom admit any liability to the undersigned but all expressly deny any liability from any and all claims, demands, damages, actions, causes of action or suits of any kind or nature whatsoever, and particularly on account of all injuries, known and unknown, both to person and property, which have resulted or may in the future develop from an accident which occurred on or about the 30th day of November, 1999, at or near Conway, S.C.\r\n  This release expressly reserves all rights of the parties released to pursue their legal remedies, if any, against the undersigned, their heirs, executors, agents and assigns.\r\n  Undersigned hereby declares that the terms of this settlement have been completely read and are fully understood and voluntarily accepted for the purpose of making a full and final compromise adjustment and settlement of any and all claims, disputed or otherwise, on account of the injuries and damages above mentioned, and for the express purpose of precluding forever any further or additional claims arising out of the aforesaid accident.\r\n\r\nTodd signed the release and acknowledged receipt of the $500. \r\nThereafter, in 2002, Todd brought a negligence action against Brereton seeking to recover damages as a result of the 1999 auto accident. Â Brereton answered, raising as an affirmative defense the release signed by Todd in 2001.Â  Brereton also moved for summary judgment, arguing the release was a complete bar to Toddâ€™s action.[1]Â  At the summary judgment hearing, Brereton argued the terms of the release were clear and unambiguous and no extrinsic evidence was needed to explain its terms.Â  Todd argued the release should not bar the action because (1) the release was an unconscionable contract of adhesion; (2) it was not properly signed by VT; (3) he was not represented by an attorney when he signed the release; (4) he did not understand the terms of the release; and (5) he was taking large doses of Oxycontin at the time he signed the release.Â  The circuit court found that Todd signed the release and that the terms of the release were clear and unambiguous.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of Brereton, finding Toddâ€™s action was barred by the release.Â  The circuit court denied Toddâ€™s motion for reconsideration, and this appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn reviewing the grant of summary judgment, [the appellate court] applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56, SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Pittman v. Grand Strand Entmâ€™t, Inc., 363 S.C. 531, 536, 611 S.E.2d 922, 925 (2005).Â  The appellate court therefore reviews all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id.Â  Once the moving party meets the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary support for the opponentâ€™s case, the nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial and cannot simply rest on mere allegations or denials contained in the pleadings.Â  Miller v. Blumenthal Mills, Inc., 365 S.C. 204, 220, 616 S.E.2d 722, 730 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Todd argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment because the release was an unconscionable contract of adhesion. Â We disagree.\r\nA release is a contract.Â  Bowers v. South Carolina Dept. of Transp., 360 S.C. 149, 153, 600 S.E.2d 543, 545 (Ct. App. 2004); 18 S.C. Jur. Release Â§ 2 (2003) (â€œBecause a release is a contract, principles of law applicable to contracts generally are also applicable to releases.â€).Â  â€œA contract of adhesion is generally thought of as a standard form contract offered on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.Â  The terms of the contract of adhesion are not negotiable.Â  An offeree faced with such a contract has two choices: complete adherence or outright rejection.â€Â  Lackey v. Green Tree Financial Corp., 330 S.C. 388, 394, 498 S.E.2d 898, 901 (Ct. App. 1998)(internal quotations omitted). \r\nThe fact that a contract is one of adhesion does not make it unconscionable.Â  Id.Â  Determining whether a contract is one of adhesion is merely the beginning point in the analysis. Â Unconscionability, on the other hand, requires a greater showing.Â  Id. at 395, 498 S.E.2d at 901.Â  Unconscionability is characterized by the â€œabsence of meaningful choice on the part of one party due to one-sided contract provisions, together with terms which are so oppressive that no reasonable person would make them and no fair and honest person would accept them.â€Â  Fanning v. Fritzâ€™s Pontiac-Cadillac-Buick Inc., 322 S.C. 399, 403, 472 S.E.2d 242, 245 (1996).\r\nThere is no evidence in the record that this was a contract of adhesion.Â  There is no evidence the terms of the release were not negotiable; in fact, the release itself indicated the key term of the release, the consideration to be paid to Todd, was negotiated and he had the right to reject the amount offered.\r\nMoreover, even if this release could be construed as a contract of adhesion, there is no evidence to conclude the release was unconscionable.Â  Toddâ€™s Â unsubstantiated allegations that the release was unconscionable because he was unrepresented when he signed the release, because he was using prescription drugs at the time he signed the release, and Â because he failed to understand the terms of the release are insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact.Â  See Shupe v. Settle, 315 S.C. 510, 516, 445 S.E.2d 529, 534 (Ct. App. 1994) (â€œA conclusory statement as to the ultimate issue in a case is not sufficient to create a genuine issue of fact for purposes of resisting summary judgment.â€).Â  Todd did not present any evidence to the circuit court that he was impaired or incapacitated as a result of his prescription drug use at the time he signed the release, or that Brereton knew of his use of Oxycontin and that he took advantage of Toddâ€™s alleged impairment.Â  Additionally, Todd failed to present any evidence to support his allegation that he did not understand the terms of the release when he signed it.Â  Lastly, Todd presented no authority, either to the circuit court or in his brief, that the release should be set aside because he was unrepresented when he signed the document.Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the order of the circuit court granting summary judgment in favor of Brereton is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and BEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur\r\n\r\n[1] The procedural posture of this case is a bit unusual.Â  First, rather than bringing an action to set aside the release, Todd filed an action as if the release did not exist.Â  Second, after Brereton answered and pled the release as an affirmative defense, Todd did not file a reply with the court alleging the release was unenforceable.Â  While this arguably could have prevented Todd from asserting the invalidity of the release, Brereton never raised this issue to the circuit court at the summary judgment hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-003","title":"Holmes v.

Oberman, both of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\n        William J. Clifford, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this divorce action, Samuel Holmes (Husband) appealsÂ  from a family court order denying him a divorce to Delores Holmes (Wife), and requiring him to pay Wife permanent periodic alimony and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife married on September 20, 1990, in Charleston, South Carolina.Â  No children were born of their marriage.Â  Both Husband and Wife have a high school education.Â  Husband is employed as an Intelligence Specialist, with a rank of E-6 in the United States Navy.Â  Wife has a work history in retail and customer services.Â  At the time of the commencement of this action, Husband had a gross monthly income of $6707.39, while Wife was unemployed.Â  The highest wage Wife has earned was eight dollars ($8.00) per hour.Â  In 1991, Husband and Wife relocated from South Carolina to Mayport, Florida, due to Husbandâ€™s military duties.Â  Between 1993 and 1996, they moved to London, England, and then returned to the United States to settle in Virginia.Â  In 1998, Husband and Wife moved to Jacksonville, Florida, where they purchased their first marital home.Â  At the time of this action, Husband owned three automobiles including a 1998 Chevy Malibu, a 1976 Lincoln, and a BMW. \r\nIn 2000, Husband had a child from an extra-marital affair.Â  In January of 2001, Wife separated from Husband due to his adulterous misconduct.Â  On November 26, 2001, Wife instituted this action against Husband in family court, seeking: (1) a divorce on the basis of Husbandâ€™s adultery and one-year separation; (2) alimony and/or spousal support; (3) a restraining order against Husband; (4) equitable distribution of marital property and debts; and (5) Husbandâ€™s payment of her attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  Husband filed a counterclaim, also seeking divorce on the basis of Wifeâ€™s adultery or one-year separation.Â  Wife denied Husbandâ€™s allegations of adultery.\r\nWife moved for temporary relief on January 9, 2002; and on April 17, 2002, the family court issued a temporary decree, ordering Husband to pay Wife one-third of his basic allowance for housing, which amounted to $213.70.Â  The family court further ordered that Husband â€œtake all steps necessaryâ€ to ensure that Wife receives all benefits to which she is entitled as the spouse of a member of the military, including medical coverage.Â  Husband did not obey the family courtâ€™s order; therefore, on June 28, 2002, the family court issued an order and rule to show cause why Husband should not be held in contempt of court for his disobedience.Â  \r\nOn October 25, 2002, the family court ordered a continuance of the hearing on the rule to show cause because Wifeâ€™s counsel was unable to serve Husband due to his military obligations out of the area.Â  The family court ordered that the hearing be reset for December 17, 2002.Â  Meanwhile, in 2003, while Husband and Wife remained married, Husband had a second child from an extra-marital affair.Â  \r\nOn June 23, 2004, Wife filed a motion to compel Husband to fully answer her request to admit, interrogatories, and request to produce.Â  Two months later, Wife filed a notice of motion for discovery sanctions against Husband for failing to respond to the interrogatories and for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  On July 30, 2004, the family court ordered Husband to fully respond to Wifeâ€™s discovery requests within thirty days of July 15, 2004.Â  Husband again failed to obey the family courtâ€™s order, and on August 31, 2004, the family court issued Husband a second order and rule to show cause why Husband should not be held in contempt for his disobedience.\r\nThe family court issued an order to continue the hearing for October 12, 2004, due to a conflict in the Husbandâ€™s counselâ€™s schedule.Â  The family court again issued an order for continuance for November 15, 2004.Â  Because Husbandâ€™s counsel sought to be relieved as counsel, and Husband was out of the country, the family court, for a fourth time, issued an order for continuance until the next term of court.Â  The family court next issued an order relieving Husbandâ€™s counsel based on Husbandâ€™s failure to cooperate with his attorney.Â  \r\nThe final hearing was held on March 23, 2005.Â  On May 3, 2005, the family court entered its final order and denied both Husband and Wife the divorce in order that Wife may retain her military medical benefits.Â  The family court awarded Wife: (1) $900 per month in permanent periodic alimony; (2) the 1998 Chevrolet Malibu automobile or its NADA value; (3) one half of the equity in the marital home, determined as $11,250; and (4) attorneyâ€™s fees in the amount of $4420.17.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, the appellate court has the authority to find the facts in accordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Ex parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 61, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652 (2006).Â  However, because the family court is in a superior position to judge the witnessesâ€™ demeanor and veracity, its findings should be given broad discretion.Â  Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003).\r\nIn the area of the award of alimony, the appellate courtâ€™s inquiry on appeal is not whether the family court gave the same weight to particular factors as the appellate court would have in making the alimony award, but, rather, whether the family court abused its discretion in assigning weight to applicable statutory factors.Â  Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 186, 554 S.E.2d 421, 425 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Divorce\r\nHusband contends the family court erred in failing to grant him a divorce because both he and Wife requested a divorce in their pleadings and the evidence established grounds for granting Husband a divorce.Â  We remand this issue to the family court for a consideration of the appropriate factors in determining whether a divorce should have been granted to Husband.Â  Section 20-3-10 of the South Carolina Code (1976) provides that divorce shall be granted upon one or more of the following grounds: (1) adultery; (2) desertion for a period of one year; (3) physical cruelty; (4) habitual drunkenness; or (5) on the application of either party if and when Husband and Wife have lived separate and apart without cohabitation for a period of one year.Â  \r\nIn his pleadings, Husband requested a divorce from Wife on the ground of one yearâ€™s continuous separation and adultery.Â  Although Wife withdrew her request for a divorce at trial, Husband made it clear that he desired a divorce.Â  Moreover, the evidence is clear that the parties had lived separate and apart without habitation for more than a year.Â  We therefore remand to the family court to consider whether Husband should have been granted a divorce on the ground of one yearâ€™s separation.Â  \r\nII.Â Â Alimony\r\nHusband contends the family court erred in awarding Wife permanent periodic alimony because Wife, as a healthy able-bodied woman in the prime of her life with a work history and no legal dependents, is fully capable of supporting herself.Â  We disagree.Â  Based on the length of the marriage, Wifeâ€™s sporadic work history, Wifeâ€™s several relocations with Husband to further his career, and Husbandâ€™s adulterous relationships, the family courtâ€™s award of separate support and maintenance[2] in the amount of nine hundred dollars ($900.00) per month is fully supported by the record before this court.\r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nHusband contends the family court erred in awarding Wife attorneyâ€™s fees because Wife is able to pay her own fees, and the award of fees to Wife under the circumstances of this case is not warranted.Â  We disagree.\r\nAttorneyâ€™s fees may be assessed against a party in an action brought in the family court.Â  Section 20-7-420(38) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005); Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 533, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004).Â  The decision to award attorneyâ€™s fees in a divorce case is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Hailey v. Hailey, 357 S.C. 18, 31, 590 S.E.2d 495, 502 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The trial courtâ€™s decision to award attorneyâ€™s fees will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Green v. Green, 320 S.C. 347, 353, 465 S.E.2d 130, 134 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  \r\nIn deciding whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees in a divorce action, the family court should consider: (1) the partiesâ€™ ability to pay their own fee; (2) the beneficial results obtained by counsel; (3) the respective financial conditions of the parties; and (4) the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living. Â Browning v. Browning, 366 S.C. 255, 269, 621 S.E.2d 389, 396 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  To determine the amount of an award of attorneysâ€™ fees, the family court should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) counselsâ€™ professional standing; (4) the contingency of compensation; (5) the beneficial results obtained; and (6) and the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Deidum v. Deidum, 362 S.C. 47, 65, 606 S.E.2d 489, 499 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nContrary to Husbandâ€™s contention, the family court considered the factors set forth in Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991), to include: (1) the beneficial results obtained by Wife; (2) the partiesâ€™ financial conditions; (3) the time Wifeâ€™s attorney necessarily devoted to the case; (4) the difficulties in bringing this case to closure; (5) customary legal fees for similar services; and (6) the professional standing of Wifeâ€™s attorney.Â  Under these circumstances, we find the family court did not abuse its discretion in awarding Wife attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the awards of spousal support and attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife.Â  We remand the issue of whether the family court should have awarded Husband a divorce based on the parties having lived separate and apart for a period of one year. \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ. and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] We construe the family courtâ€™s award of support to Wife as an award of spousal support pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-140 (1976).Â  While Husband complains that Wife did not request separate support and maintenance in her pleadings, she did request spousal support in her complaint.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-004","title":"Anvar v.

Garrison Hill, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-004\r\nHeard December 4, 2006 â€“ Filed January 10, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        L. Henry McKellar, Christian Stegmaier, and Suzanne C. Boulware, all of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Sally M. Purnell and Matthew P. Utecht, both of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this civil conspiracy case, Dr. Stephen Anvar appeals the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to Greenville Hospital System (individually, â€œHospitalâ€) and its agents and employees, Dr. John R. Sanders, Dr. John Rowell, Dr. Tim Sullivan, Dr. Robin Kelley, and Dr. Fleming Mattox (these physicians and Hospital, collectively, are â€œRespondentsâ€).Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nBecause this appeal is from a grant of summary judgment to Respondents, we view the facts, as we must, in the light most favorable to Dr. Anvar.Â  See, e.g., Summer v. Carpenter,&nbsp;328 S.C. 36, 42, 492 S.E.2d 55, 58&nbsp;(1997) (â€œIn determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€).\r\nDr. Anvar practices medicine as a radiologist and a neurointerventionalist.Â  During the time this case arose, he was employed by Greenville Radiology, a private group of radiologists.Â  Although Dr. Anvar was not employed by Hospital, he had privileges to perform radiological procedures at Hospital.Â  He is specially trained to perform a carotid angioplasty/stenting (â€œCASâ€) procedure.Â  \r\nOn May 25, 2001, Dr. Sella Littlepage contacted Dr. Anvar and asked him to perform an emergency diagnostic angiogram on a patient at Hospital.[1]Â  Dr. Littlepage had already performed a carotid endarterectomy (â€œCEAâ€) on the patient, and Dr. Anvarâ€™s angiogram thereafter revealed a ninety percent stenosis, or narrowing, of the patientâ€™s carotid artery. Â After reviewing several alternatives, Dr. Littlepage and Dr. Anvar concluded Dr. Anvar should perform a CAS procedure to attempt to remove the blockage and prevent a stroke.Â  \r\nDuring the stenting procedure, Dr. Anvar remembered a conversation he previously had with his colleague, Dr. Lee Madeline, about the Angioguard, a device made by Cordis, a Johnson &amp; Johnson Company, used to catch clots that break off during a CEA or CAS procedure and prevent them from traveling into the cerebral circulation.Â  Dr. Madeline was a partner of Dr. Anvarâ€™s employed at Greenville Radiology as a neurointerventionalist.Â  Dr. Anvar sent a technician, Ralph Scott, to retrieve the device from an operating room, and Dr. Anvar used it on the patient.Â  The patient was thereafter returned to the surgical recovery area.Â \r\nDr. Madeline, Dr. Sullivan, and other physicians were studying the Angioguard as part of a clinical trial program, called the SAPPHIRE[2] Trial, at Hospital.Â  Dr. Sullivan, a vascular surgeon employed by Hospital, was the principal investigator for the SAPPHIRE Trial at Hospital.Â  The Angioguard was labeled at the time of this incident as being suitable for â€œinvestigational use onlyâ€ and was classified as a device of â€œsignificant riskâ€ by the Federal Drug Administration (â€œFDAâ€).Â  As an investigational device, the Angioguard could be used only in a clinical setting as part of a trial, and regulations required a physician to obtain a patientâ€™s informed consent before using it.Â  At the time he used the Angioguard on the patient, Dr. Anvar had not received the patientâ€™s consent, had not seen the device used, and had never been trained to use it.Â  \r\nDr. Sullivan, upset over the unauthorized use of the Angioguard device, contacted Hospital administration.Â  Dr. Sanders, the vice president of Medical Staff Affairs at Hospital, investigated the incident.Â  Dr. Sanders was concerned because the Angioguard device was to be used only in the investigational study and because there were concerns raised about whether Dr. Anvar knew how to use the device.Â Â Â  \r\nDr. Sanders notified Dr. Kelley, chairperson of Hospitalâ€™s Institutional Research Committee (â€œIRCâ€), the body charged with administering Hospitalâ€™s clinical trials.Â  Dr. Kelley appointed an IRC subcommittee, chaired by Dr. Mattox, to conduct an inquiry.Â  At the same time, Dr. Sanders asked Dr. Rowell, president of Hospitalâ€™s Medical Staff, to investigate Dr. Anvarâ€™s conduct.Â  Dr. Rowell appointed an Ad Hoc Committee in conjunction with Hospitalâ€™s Medical Executive Committee (â€œMECâ€), of which Dr. Rowell was also president.Â  Hospitalâ€™s IRC Policies and Procedures allow the IRC to report research misconduct to the medical staff, but the IRC has no jurisdiction to suspend a physicianâ€™s ability to practice medicine at Hospital.Â  Hospitalâ€™s Bylaws allow the MEC to conduct â€œpatient care quality and appropriateness reviews.â€Â  \r\nThe IRC ultimately decided Dr. Anvarâ€™s participation in research at Hospital should be suspended for five years.Â  In a report dated July 19, 2001, the MEC recommended to Hospitalâ€™s Board of Trustees that Dr. Anvar be placed on probation for twelve months and be given a letter of reprimand.Â  After considering the MECâ€™s recommendation, the Board of Trustees, by letter dated July 24, 2001, placed Dr. Anvar on probation for five years, required him to complete a bioethics course within one year, and issued a letter of reprimand.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn May 2003, Dr. Anvar filed a complaint against Respondents, alleging a civil conspiracy and violation of due process.Â  Dr. Anvar asserted his suspension and probation were solely the result of Respondentsâ€™ combined intent to injure him because of a â€œturf battleâ€ at Hospital between radiologists who were not Hospital employees, such as Dr. Anvar, and vascular surgeons who were employed by Hospital, such as Dr. Sullivan, over which medical procedure was going to be performed by which medical specialty.Â  \r\nRespondents answered and later moved for summary judgment.Â  The circuit court initially denied the motion.Â  After Respondents filed a motion to alter or amend the order, the circuit court granted partial summary judgment in favor of Respondents on Dr. Anvarâ€™s civil conspiracy claim.[3]Â  Specifically, the circuit court granted summary judgment because Dr. Anvar (1) alleged a conspiracy between Hospital and its agents and employees acting within the scope of their authority, but Hospital can act only through its agents and employees and a legal entity such as Hospital cannot conspire with itself under South Carolina law; (2) produced no evidence of a combination or agreement among Respondents with the intent to injure him; and (3) produced no evidence of special damages.Â  Dr. Anvar made a motion to alter or amend this order, and the circuit court modified its order to grant summary judgment to Respondents on the claim of civil conspiracy based on the lack of evidence of an agreement among Respondents to injure Dr. Anvar.Â  The circuit court deleted the other two grounds for granting summary judgment.Â  This appeal followed.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the grant of a motion for summary judgment, an appellate court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Ferguson v. Charleston Lincoln Mercury, Inc., 349 S.C. 558, 564 S.E.2d 94 (2002).Â  Summary judgment is appropriate when â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; see also Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Marine Contracting &amp; Towing Co., 301 S.C. 418, 421, 392 S.E.2d 460, 462 (1990).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.Â  Summer v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 492 S.E.2d 55 (1997).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDr. Anvar argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to Respondents on his claim for civil conspiracy.Â  We disagree.\r\nA civil conspiracy is a combination of two or more parties joined for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff, thereby causing the plaintiff special damages.Â  Angus v. Burroughs &amp; Chapin Co., 368 S.C. 167, 170, 628 S.E.2d 261, 262&nbsp;(2006).Â  In order to establish a civil conspiracy, the record must contain evidence, either direct or circumstantial, of the joint assent of two or more persons for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff.Â  Cowburn v. Leventis, 366 S.C. 20, 49, 619 S.E.2d 437, 453&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005); First Union Natâ€™l Bank v. Soden, 333 S.C. 554, 575, 511 S.E.2d 372, 383 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nDr. Anvarâ€™s civil conspiracy claim is based on his allegation that a competition existed between vascular surgeons who were employed by Hospital and radiologists who were not employed by Hospital over which specialty would perform certain procedures.Â  On appeal, Respondents contend the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment on the ground that Dr. Anvar had presented no evidence of an agreement among Respondents to injure him.Â  All the evidence shows, Respondents contend, is that Dr. Anvar was properly disciplined for using a medical device that was clearly marked for investigational use only and that this discipline applied only to his participation in clinical trials, not to his work as a radiologist at Hospital.Â  Respondents further argue, as an additional sustaining ground, that the circuit courtâ€™s decision granting summary judgment should be affirmed because Dr. Anvar alleges a civil conspiracy between a corporation and its agents and employees all acting in the scope of their authority, and as a matter of law an entity cannot conspire with itself.\r\nWe address only the latter contention.\r\nAn appellate court may review a respondentâ€™s additional reasons to affirm the judgment and, if convinced it is proper and fair to do so, rely on them or any other reason appearing in the record to affirm the lower courtâ€™s judgment.Â  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant,&nbsp;338 S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723&nbsp;(2000); see also Rule 220(c), SCACR (â€œThe appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.â€).\r\nIn a case involving a physicianâ€™s (an anesthesiologistâ€™s) allegation of civil conspiracy against Oconee Memorial Hospital and a competing anesthesiology group, our supreme court recently stated that â€œa civil conspiracy cannot exist when the alleged acts arise in the context of a principal-agent relationship because by virtue of the relationship such acts do not involve separate entities.â€Â  McMillan v. Oconee Memâ€™l Hosp., 367 S.C. 559, 564, 626 S.E.2d 884, 886-87 (2006).Â  The court in McMillan noted that it had previously â€œheld that agents for a corporation acting in the scope of their duties cannot conspire with the corporation absent the guilty knowledge of a third party.â€Â  Id. at 564, 626 S.E.2d at 887 (citing Goble v. Am. Ry. Express Co., 124 S.C. 19, 26-27, 115 S.E. 900, 903 (1923)).Â  The court stated:Â  â€œ[W]e believe that it is well settled that a corporation cannot conspire with itself.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nAs is explained in American Jurisprudence, where agents and employees are acting in the course and scope of their authority for the benefit of the corporation and not for their own personal gain, it is not legally possible for there to be a civil conspiracy with the corporation:\r\n\r\n  Since a corporate entity cannot conspire with itself a civil conspiracy is not legally possible where a corporation and its alleged coconspirators are not separate entities, but, rather, stand in either a principal-agent or employer-employee relationship with the corporation.Â  Thus, a corporation cannot conspire with its agent when the agent is acting within the scope of his or her authority and a corporation cannot be a party to a conspiracy consisting of the corporation and the persons engaged in the management, direction, and control of the corporate affairs, where the individuals are acting only for the corporation and not for any personal purpose of their own.\r\n\r\n16 Am. Jur. 2d Conspiracy Â§ 56 (1998) (footnotes omitted), cited with approval in McMillan v. Oconee Memâ€™l Hosp., 367 S.C. 559, 626 S.E.2d 884Â  (2006).\r\nIn the case now before us, Dr. Anvar challenges Hospitalâ€™s decision to suspend him and place him on probation.Â  To support his position, Dr. Anvar challenges the actions of Respondents performed while acting within the scope of their authority at Hospital.Â  Hospital is a public corporation.Â  At the time this action arose, Respondents were all agents or employees of Hospital.Â  Dr. Sanders was vice president of Medical Staff Affairs; Dr. Rowell was an orthopedic surgeon and president of MEC at Hospital; Dr. Sullivan was a vascular surgeon and the principal investigator for the SAPPHIRE Trial; Dr. Kelley was a pediatric infectious disease specialist and president of the IRC at Hospital; and Dr. Mattox was a urogynecologist and a member of a subcommittee of the IRC at Hospital.Â Â Â  \r\nThere is no evidence in the record that the physicians in this case acted in any manner other than in their capacities as agents and employees for Hospital or that they acted other than on behalf of the corporation.Â  Although Dr. Anvar summarily alleges that Respondents generally received a benefit by means of more business, there is no evidence to support this assertion or to demonstrate that either Hospital or the physician Respondents received any personal benefit from Dr. Anvarâ€™s disciplinary matter.Â  \r\nA corporation can act only through its directors, officers, agents, and employees.Â  Thus, because the actions of Hospitalâ€™s agents and employees were all performed while acting within the course and scope of their authority, Dr. Anvarâ€™s claim is barred by the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine.Â  See McMillan, 367 S.C. at 564-65, 626 S.E.2d at 886-87 (holding a civil conspiracy cannot exist in the context of a principal-agent relationship where the individuals are all acting only for the corporation and not for any personal purpose of their own); see also Cameron v. Church, 253 F. Supp. 2d 611, 623 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (stating â€œ[t]he intracorporate conspiracy doctrine provides that the officers, agents and employees of a single corporate or municipal entity, each acting within the scope of his or her employment, legally are incapable of conspiring togetherâ€ and holding the plaintiffâ€™s claim of a civil conspiracy was barred by the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine where the individual defendants were all acting within the scope of their employment for the County of Westchester and thus no actionable conspiracy existed as a matter of law); Perk v. Vector Res. Group, Ltd., 485 S.E.2d 140, 144&nbsp;(Va. 1997) (holding where Perk alleged a principal-agent or an employer-employee relationship existed between the several defendants, the trial court properly sustained a demurrer on Perkâ€™s claim of civil conspiracy because the defendants were not separate entities and â€œan entity cannot conspire with itselfâ€ (cited with approval in McMillan v. Oconee Memâ€™l Hosp., Inc., 367 S.C. 559, 626 S.E.2d 884 (2006)).Â  \r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to Respondents on Dr. Anvarâ€™s claim of civil conspiracy is, hereby,\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The record variously refers to the patient having an angiogram or an arteriogram.Â  \r\n[2]Â  SAPPHIRE is an acronym for Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy.Â  \r\n[3]Â Â  The circuit court denied the motion for summary judgment as to the due process claim.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-005","title":"Burkett v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Harold M.

Â The State appeals. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, because the motion to reconsider Brooksâ€™ sentence did not expressly include a request to withdraw the guilty plea, the State argues the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear Brooksâ€™ motion to withdraw his guilty plea.Â  We disagree. \r\nRule 29 of the South Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure provides: â€œExcept for motions for new trials based on after-discovered evidence, post trial motions shall be made within ten (10) days after the imposition of the sentence.â€Â  While it is true that the circuit court loses jurisdiction over the case if no post trial motion is made within ten days after the imposition of the sentence, Town of Hilton Head Island v. Godwin, 370 S.C. 221, 225, 634 S.E.2d 59, 61 (Ct. App. 2006), the circuit court retains jurisdiction over the case if a post trial motion is made within ten days after the imposition of the sentence.Â  When a post trial motion is timely made, the circuit court maintains subject matter jurisdiction over the case.Â  Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 150, 526 S.E.2d 222, 227 (2000) (â€œSubject matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.â€); State v. Crocker, 366 S.C. 394, 401-02, 621 S.E.2d 890, 894 (Ct. App. 2005) (â€œThe circuit court has original jurisdiction in all criminal matters except those where an inferior court is given exclusive jurisdiction.â€) (citing State v. Dudley, 364 S.C. 578, 582, 614 S.E.2d 623, 625 (2005)).\r\nHere, Brooks timely filed his motion to reconsider the sentence and, as result, the circuit court retained jurisdiction over the case.Â  Assuming the withdrawal of the guilty plea was not encompassed in the general motion to reconsider the sentence, the State did not object in the circuit court to consideration of the request to withdraw the guilty plea.Â  We do not view the circuit courtâ€™s consideration of the motion to withdraw the guilty plea as a matter of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Because a motion to reconsider the sentence was timely filed, the circuit court had jurisdiction to consider the request to withdraw the guilty plea.\r\nA motion to withdraw a guilty plea is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  State v. Lambert, 266 S.C. 574, 580, 225 S.E.2d 340, 342-43 (1976).Â  There is no assignment of error in this regard. \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-007","title":"State v.

Derham Cole, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-007\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2007 â€“ Filed January 11, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Chief Attorney Joseph L. Savitz III, Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Senior Assistant Attorney General William Edgar Salter, III, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Jonah Israel Lowder was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.Â  Lowder appeals, arguing the trial court erred by allowing the State to (1) introduce evidence that he had invoked his right to counsel during custodial interrogation, (2) cross-examine him about his invocation of the right to counsel, and (3) argue in closing that his invocation of the right to counsel was proof of his guilt.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS/ANALYSIS\r\nLowder was convicted of murder for the death of Robert Allen Arthur, who died in Spartanburg County when his skull was crushed by a cement block on or about August 6, 2002.Â  Lowder, then 23, and Arthur, who was in his 50s, were both homeless and transient, and had just met that day.Â  The two had spent the afternoon drinking together near a truck stop; thereafter, Â Arthur had invited Lowder to his campsite nearby to rest for the night.Â  \r\nAt trial, Lowder admitted that he had killed Arthur with a cement block.Â  He claimed, however, that he did it because Arthur first attacked him with the same cement block during an attempted homosexual advance while he was sleeping.Â  Lowder testified that he had awakened in the night to find Arthur, with his pants pulled down, leaning over him with the cement block.Â  Lowder stated he had grabbed the cement block and beaten Arthur with it only to defend himself.Â  Lowder acknowledged at trial that he never alleged during his police interrogations that Arthur had attempted to sexually assault him, but maintained it was because he did not want that information to be published in the newspapers.Â  During the investigation of this case, police investigators had spoken to Lowder on at least three occasions.Â Â Â  Â \r\nDuring direct examination, the solicitor questioned one of the investigators involved in Lowderâ€™s case, Officer Jeremy Mathis of the Bay County Sheriffâ€™s Office in Panama City, Florida.Â  Lowder was tracked by South Carolina authorities to a jail in Bay County during the course of the investigation into Arthurâ€™s death.Â  The solicitor inquired whether Lowder had said anything when they were taking his palm prints.Â  The investigator replied:\r\n\r\n  He was very inquisitive as to why we needed his palm prints.Â  He wanted to know what they were being used for.Â  And I think it is important to note that the only involvement I had ever had with Mr. Lowder at the time was for, to assist Spartanburg in their investigation.Â  I had never been a part of any other case that involved him.Â  Since I knew that he had asked for a lawyer, of course --Â  Â Â \r\n\r\nDefense counsel moved for a mistrial on the basis the officer â€œmade a[n] impermissible reference to Mr. Lowderâ€™s right to counsel.â€Â  The trial court denied the motion.Â  The court noted that the State was at a disadvantage because Lowder had previously moved to suppress his statements as involuntary at the start of the trial and it was the Stateâ€™s burden to prove to the jury that the statements were freely and voluntarily made.Â  Defense counsel then stated he was not going to challenge before the jury the voluntariness of the statements.Â Â Â  \r\nAfter further discussion, the trial court stated:Â  \r\n\r\n  All heâ€™s testified to at the present time is the fact that he knew that Mr. Lowder had requested a lawyer and so he wasnâ€™t going to talk to him.Â  And I certainly donâ€™t think thatâ€™s a comment upon his invocation of his right to remain silent.Â  Thatâ€™s just an explanation as to why he refused to carry on a conversation with him . . . that he knew he had requested a lawyer and so he wasnâ€™t going to talk to him.Â  \r\n  The issue now is going to simply be how to handle that since youâ€™re not challenging the voluntariness.\r\n  I guess the witness can simply testify that Mr. Lowder initiated a conversation with the witness wherein he stated he wanted to talk to the police about the case . . . .Â  \r\n\r\nThe general rule in South Carolina is that a mistrial should be granted â€œin cases of manifest necessity and with the greatest caution for very plain and obvious reasons.â€Â  State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 227, 522 S.E.2d 845, 851 (Ct. App. 1999); see also State v. Kirby,&nbsp;269 S.C. 25, 28-29, 236 S.E.2d 33, 34&nbsp;(1977) (â€œThe power of a court to declare a mistrial ought to be used with the greatest caution under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes.â€).Â  \r\nâ€œAmong the factors to be considered in ordering a mistrial are the character of the testimony, the circumstances under which it was offered, the nature of the case, and the other testimony in the case.â€Â  State v. Howard,&nbsp;296 S.C. 481, 483, 374 S.E.2d 284, 285&nbsp;(1988).Â  â€œA trial judgeâ€™s decision to grant or deny a mistrial will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law.â€Â  State v. Rowlands,&nbsp;343 S.C. 454, 458, 539 S.E.2d 717, 719&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\nIn this case, we agree with the trial courtâ€™s reasoning that a mistrial was not warranted as the witness did not make an impermissible comment on Lowderâ€™s right to remain silent.Â  Rather, as the trial court noted, it was simply an explanation regarding why the detective did not pursue further questioning with Lowder at that time.Â  \r\nMoreover, Lowder subsequently waived his right to counsel and spoke with the officers during their investigation.Â  The background given by the witness was to explain how Lowderâ€™s later statements came about.Â  As the court pointed out, Lowder had initially moved at the start of the trial to suppress his statements as involuntary, but later chose not to challenge their voluntariness at trial.Â  We discern, then, no prejudice from the witnessâ€™s brief comment about Lowderâ€™s request for a lawyer.Â  Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial courtâ€™s denial of Lowderâ€™s motion for a mistrial.Â  \r\nAs to Lowderâ€™s two remaining issues regarding the extent of cross-examination[2] and closing argument,[3] no objections were made to these matters at trial.Â  Since the alleged errors were not raised to and ruled upon by the trial court, they are not properly before us for review.Â  See State v. Dunbar,&nbsp;356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693-94&nbsp;(2003) (â€œIn order for an issue to be preserved for appellate review, it must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge.Â  Issues not raised and ruled upon in the trial court will not be considered on appeal.â€); State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991) (observing a contemporaneous objection is required to properly preserve alleged errors for review on direct appeal); State v. Rice,&nbsp;348 S.C. 417, 559 S.E.2d 360 (Ct. App. 2001) (stating as a general rule that all errors not involving subject matter jurisdiction must be raised and ruled on at trial to be preserved for further review and may not be raised for the first time on appeal).\r\nBased on the foregoing, the judgment below is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  This cross-examination concerned Lowderâ€™s failure to allege, during his several statements to the police, that the victim had attempted to sexually assault him.Â  No objections were made to this questioning at trial, so no issue is preserved in this regard.\r\n[3]Â  Lowder argues the solicitor â€œexploitedâ€ during closing argument the evidence of his exercising his right to counsel, but no contemporaneous objection was made in this regard so as to preserve the issue for appeal.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-008","title":"Estate of Laura J.

Hughston, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No.Â  2007-UP-008\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2007 â€“ Filed January 11, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Eduardo Kelvin Curry, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\n        Sherry Bingley Crummey, Â for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This appeal arises from a formal testacy proceeding to invalidate a will.Â  The circuit court affirmed an order of the probate court declaring the will at issue to be null and void.Â  Alta Ruth Robinson, the proponent of the will, appeals to this court.Â  We affirm.[1] \r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThe decedent, Laura J. Mims, died on January 23, 2003.Â  On or about January 27, 2003, respondent Shelia Hood presented to the Charleston County Probate Court a will dated March 2, 1999, naming Hood as the personal representative of Mimsâ€™s estate as well as a devisee.Â  Shortly thereafter, on or about February 4, 2003, Robinson presented to the probate court a will dated January 22, 2000.Â  The second will named Robinson as the personal representative of Mimsâ€™s estate and as the principal beneficiary.\r\nHood filed this action on July 30, 2003, after the probate court decided to probate the will Robinson had presented instead of the 1999 will.Â  Hoodâ€™s complaint alleged (1) execution of the 2000 will was procured by fraud; (2) Mims never signed the instrument; (3) the will was not properly witnessed; and (4) the notarization was forged.Â  Hood requested revocation of the probate of the 2000 will, admission of the 1999 will to probate in solemn form, and an order that Robinson refrain from exercising any power of administration except as necessary to preserve the estate or as otherwise directed by the court.Â Â Â  \r\nA hearing in the matter took place on February 19, 2004.Â  On July 9, 2004, the probate judge signed an order invalidating the 2000 will for several reasons including (1) concern that Mims did not know the content of the 2000 will; (2) â€œquestionable circumstancesâ€ regarding the notaryâ€™s signature; (3) disagreement between Robinsonâ€™s witnesses regarding the individuals present at the signing of the will; (4) an apparent misspelling of Mimsâ€™s name in the first signature line of the will; (5) a discrepancy between the name of a witness who signed the will and the corresponding name typed on the document; and (6) the fact that the will was allegedly signed at Mimsâ€™s home on a Saturday.Â  In conclusion, the probate court held the authenticity of the entire January 22, 2000 will was suspect based on â€œ[t]he combination of . . . errors in this one document without any credible explanations offered by the proponents of the will.â€\r\nRobinson appealed to the circuit court, which heard arguments of counsel on December 13, 2004.Â  By written order dated April 26, 2005, the circuit court affirmed the probate courtâ€™s decision.Â  On May 9, 2005, Robinson moved under Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to alter or amend the circuit courtâ€™s order.Â  Following the denial of this motion, Robinson filed this appeal.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  We disagree with Robinsonâ€™s assertions of error in the findings by the probate court and the circuit court that Mims did not know the contents of the 2000 will.\r\nGenerally, will contests are actions at law.[2]Â  In such cases, both this court and the circuit court, when sitting as an appellate court in the matter, will uphold the findings by the probate court if they are supported by any evidence.[3]Â  \r\nWe agree with the circuit courtâ€™s determination that the record contains evidence that supports the probate courtâ€™s determination that Mims did not know the contents of the 2000 will when she signed it.Â  Charles Drayton, a non-lawyer and funeral home employee who claimed to have drafted the instrument, testified Mims instructed him she wished to have her estate â€œdivided among her niece [i.e. Robinson] and nephewsâ€; however, the will on its face designates Robinson as the sole beneficiary, with the nephews taking in succession only if the others failed to survive.Â  Moreover, it appears from Draytonâ€™s testimony that he did not read the will to Mims and, although Mims allegedly took ten minutes to sign it, Drayton was unable to verify that he saw her reading the document.Â  Drayton then acknowledged that he took the original will with him, and there is no evidence suggesting he gave a copy to Mims or anyone else.\r\n2.Â  As to Robinsonâ€™s assertions of error regarding the determinations that the notaryâ€™s testimony was unclear as to whether she in fact had notarized the 2000 will, we find no reversible error.Â  Although, as Robinson points out in her brief, defects in notarization are not necessarily fatal to the proper execution of a will, the will in this case was invalidated because of indications that the decedent did not know its contents.\r\n3.Â  Finally, we disagree with Robinsonâ€™s argument that the probate court improperly shifted the burden of proof to her.Â  In support of her position, Robinson suggests that, because Mims allegedly executed the will in question more than three years before she died, she had the opportunity to revoke or change it.Â  There is no evidence, however, that Mims was provided a copy of the 2000 will or was otherwise alerted to the discrepancy between her instructions to Drayton regarding the disposition of her estate and the actual provisions in the will.Â  Moreover, Drayton, even though he never testified that he was an attorney or had expertise in drafting wills, had assumed the role of a legal professional.[4]Â  Absent evidence to the contrary, it was reasonable for Mims to assume he had drafted the will according to her specifications.[5]\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  We further note that, although under Rule 208(4), SCACR, this court â€œmay take such action as it deems properâ€ because Respondents have not filed a brief in this appeal, we have not found any error that would warrant reversing the decision of the circuit court. \r\n[2]Â  Estate of Cumbee v.

Thomas, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-009\r\nSubmitted December 1, 2006 â€“ Filed January 11, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Assistant Appellate Defender Aileen P. Clare, Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant,\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Special Assistant Attorney General Amie L. Clifford, all of Columbia; and Solicitor John Gregory Hembree, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Charles Leroy Dean appeals his convictions for two counts of criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the second degree and a single count of disseminating obscene materials to a minor.Â  He argues the trial court erred in admitting evidence of uncharged acts and in denying his motion to sequester witnesses.Â  We affirm.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nCharles Leroy Dean was employed at the Tara Hall Home for Boys[1] (the Home) as a child care worker from July of 1997 until his suspension in January of 2000.Â  During his time at the Home, Dean shared living quarters with the boys he supervised.Â  Dean had direct supervision over seven boys who ranged from nine to fifteen years of age. \r\nOn January 28, 2000, a thirteen-year-old boy (Doe) informed the Home that Dean had forced him into receiving oral sex.Â  Doe stated the incident had occurred two days prior to his telling the Home.Â  The Home alerted the Georgetown County Sheriffâ€™s Department (the Police) and the South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) and immediately suspended Dean.Â Â  \r\nSubsequent to the above accusations, the Police spoke with a fifteen-year-old boy (Roe) who had previously been under the supervision of Dean.Â  Roe informed the Police that he and Dean had an ongoing sexual relationship during his time at the Home.Â  Roe testified that he and Dean had engaged in oral and anal sex on many different occasions.Â Â  \r\nLastly, a fifteen-year-old third boy informed Police that Dean had utilizedÂ his computerÂ toÂ show the boy images of Â nudeÂ men and women having sex.[2]Â  In a statement given to Police and DSS, Dean admitted to showing this boy nude pictures of men and women.Â Â  \r\nA Georgetown County grand jury indicted Dean for two counts of criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the second degree and three counts of disseminating obscene materials to a minor.Â  The State elected to try Dean on only one count of disseminating obscene material to a minor.Â  At trial, the jury convicted Dean on all charges, and the trial court sentenced him to fifteen years imprisonment.[3]Â  This appeal followed.Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.â€ Â State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  On appeal, we are limited to determining whether the trial judge abused his discretion.Â  State v. Bowie, 360 S.C. 210, 216, 600 S.E.2d 112, 115 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law.â€Â  State v. Foster, 354 S.C. 614, 621, 582 S.E.2d 426, 429 (2003).Â  This Court does not reassess the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Admission of Evidence\r\nDean contends the trial court erred in admitting evidence of â€œuncharged conductâ€ in violation of State v. Lyle[4] and Rules 403 and 404(b), SCRE.Â  We find this argument is not preserved for our review.\r\nÂ â€œA ruling in limine is not final; unless an objection is made at the time the evidence is offered and a final ruling procured, the issue is not preserved for review.â€Â  State v. Smith, 337 S.C. 27, 32, 522 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1999).Â  Although Dean moved in limine to exclude any testimony of uncharged conduct, his motion was denied, and he failed to object to the admission of this testimony at the time it was offered.[5]Â  We find this issue is not preserved for our review.\r\nII.Â  Sequestration of the Witnesses\r\nDean contends the trial court erred in refusing to sequester the witnesses against him.Â  He argues the witnesses should have been sequestered to prevent their collusion in falsely accusing him.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe South Carolina Constitution contains a â€œVictimsâ€™ Bill of Rightsâ€ which states in pertinent part:Â  \r\n\r\n  To preserve and protect victimsâ€™ rights to justice and due process regardless of race, sex, age, religion, or economic status, victims of crime have the right to:Â  (3) be informed of and present at any criminal proceedings which are dispositive of the charges where the defendant has the right to be present.\r\n\r\nS.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 24.Â  Section 16-3-1510 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) includes in its definition of a â€œvictimâ€ the parents of a minor victim.Â  Further, â€œa party is not entitled to have witnesses sequestered as a matter of right,â€ and â€œthe decision to sequester witnesses is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.â€Â  State v. Tisdale, 338 S.C. 607, 616, 527 S.E.2d 389, 394 (Ct. App. 2000).Â Â  \r\nAlthough Dean was tried in absentia, he certainly had the right to be present.Â  The trial court found the Victimsâ€™ Bill of Rights granted the victims a right to be present.Â  Based on the above cited law, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Deanâ€™s motion to sequester the witnesses.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find Deanâ€™s appeal of the trial courtâ€™s admission of evidence of uncharged conduct is not preserved for our review, and we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s denial of Deanâ€™s motion to sequester the witnesses.Â  Based on the foregoing, Deanâ€™s conviction is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Tara Hall was described by its director as a home and school for boys who have been abused or neglected or who have emotional and behavioral problems.Â  \r\n[2] Notably, both Doe and Roe had also alleged that Dean had shown them images of nude men and women having sex. \r\n[3]Â  Dean was tried in absentia.Â  After the verdict was announced, his sentence was sealed by the trial court.Â  Dean was a fugitive for over three years and was not apprehended until March of 2005.Â  At this time, his sentence was unsealed.\r\n[4] State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923).\r\n[5] Notably, Deanâ€™s counsel not only failed to object to this testimony, but also called further attention to the uncharged conduct by questioning the witnesses on this evidence during cross-examination.Â  In fact, once the trial court denied his motion in limine, Deanâ€™s attorney specifically requested that he be allowed to question Roe about his allegations of anal intercourse with Dean.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-010","title":"Jordan v.

(Kelly Co).Â  Kelly Co. is a trucking company which specializes in transporting oversized equipment.Â  Jordan suffered a heart attack on January 11, 2003, during one of his trips for Kelly Co.Â  Jordan claims the heart attack was proximately caused by unexpected strain or over-exertion in the performance of the duties of his employment or by the unusual and extraordinary conditions of this particular trip.Â  \r\nJordan testified that he was sent to Virginia to pick up a large piece of equipment and haul it to Texas.Â  Jordan claims he was told by the Kelly Co dispatcher that the load had to be in Houston before five oâ€™clock on Friday afternoon and that later this â€œdeadlineâ€ was pushed back to noon on Saturday.Â  It is undisputed that when he arrived in Virginia at the pickup location, the load was not ready to be picked up, and this delayed his departure by seven hours.Â  Due to the size of the equipment, Jordan could only travel with special permits issued by each state he was passing through.Â  These permits controlled the routes and times drivers could haul oversized loads through each state, and hauling an oversized load in a state without a permit would be illegal.Â  Jordan claims that when he started hauling the load in Virginia, he had not yet received the Virginia permit.Â  It is undisputed that when Jordan arrived in Houston, part of the specified route was closed due to construction, and he continued through downtown without an escort.Â  During his travels from Virginia to Texas, Jordan started to experience symptoms later associated with a heart attack, and he suffered a heart attack after he delivered the load on Saturday.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nJordan sought workersâ€™ compensation benefits claiming the heart attack was proximately caused by stress from the deadline imposed for delivery, having to drive without a permit, and having to deviate from a specified route in a heavily congested area.Â  Jordanâ€™s claims were heard by the Single Commissioner on June 21, 2004.Â  On October 29, 2004, the Commissioner issued an order finding Jordan had suffered a compensable heart attack, awarding him temporary total compensation beginning on February 3, 2003, and holding the appellants responsible for payment of his past medical expenses and future medical care until he reaches maximum medical improvement.Â  On November 12, 2004, Appellants filed an application for appellate review.\r\nThe full commission heard the appeal on February 24, 2005.Â  By order issued on March 23, 2005, the Commission found that despite the difficulties Jordan encountered on the day of heart attack, the heart attack was not compensable because he was performing his regular job duties in the ordinary and normal manner without being subjected to unusual or extraordinary conditions.Â  Therefore, the Commission reversed the single commissionerâ€™s order.Â  Jordan filed an appeal on April 22, 2005.Â  \r\nThe circuit court held an appellate hearing on September, 23, 2005.Â  By order issued October 19, 2005, the circuit court reversed the full commission and reinstated the single commissionerâ€™s order.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  S.C.Code Ann.Â Â  Â§1-23-380 (2005); Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 132, 276 S.E.2d 304, 305 (1981).Â  â€œThe appellate courtâ€™s review is limited to deciding whether the commissionâ€™s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law.â€Â  Hendricks v. Pickens County, 335 S.C. 405, 411, 517 S.E.2d 698, 701 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Substantial evidence is â€œnot a mere scintilla of evidence nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached or must have reached in order to justify its action.â€&nbsp; Miller by Miller v. State Roofing Co., 312 S.C. 452, 454, 441 S.E.2d 323, 324-25 (1994) (quoting Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981)). \r\nâ€œA judgment upon which reasonable men might differ will not be set aside.â€Â  Toddâ€™s Ice Cream, Inc. v. South Carolina Employment Sec. Commâ€™n, 281 S.C. 254, 258, 315 S.E.2d 373, 375 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  The final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the Commission.Â  Ross v. American Red Cross, 298 S.C. 490, 492, 381 S.E.2d 728, 730 (1989).Â  The reviewing court may not â€œsubstitute its judgment for that of the [Commission] as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(6) (2005).Â  â€œWhere there is a conflict in the evidence, either of different witnesses or of the same witnesses, the findings of fact of the Commission as triers of fact are conclusive.â€Â Â  Hoxit v. Michelin Tire Corp., 304 S.C. 461, 465, 405 S.E.2d 407, 409 (1991).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants claim the circuit court erred in holding the Commissionâ€™s findings were not supported by substantial evidence and therefore reversing the Commissionâ€™s order.Â  We agree.\r\nHeart attacks are compensable as an accident if induced by unexpected strain or over-exertion in the performance of the duties of employment or by unusual and extraordinary conditions in the employment. Â Green v. City of Bennettsville, 197 S.C. 313, 15 S.E.2d 334 (1941). Â This is true even though preexisting conditions may have been a contributing factor. Â Sweatt v. Marlboro Cotton Mills, 206 S.C. 476, 34 S.E.2d 762 (1945). Â However, heart attacks resulting from the ordinary exertion that is required in the performance of the duties of the employment in the ordinary and usual manner, and without any outward untoward event, are not compensable as an accident. Â Rivers v. V. P. Loftis Co., 214 S.C. 162, 51 S.E.2d 510 (1949); Sims v. South Carolina State Commission of Forestry, 235 S.C. 1, 109 S.E.2d 701 (1959).\r\nGiven the limited review allowed in cases arising from administrative agencies, the circuit court should have only reversed the full commission if the record lacked substantial evidence to support the commissionâ€™s findings.Â  Therefore, if after considering the record as a whole we find a reasonable mind could have reached the same conclusion as the full commission, we must reverse the circuit court and reinstate the commissionâ€™s order.\r\nDaniel Kelly, Kelly Coâ€™s owner and a truck driver, and Rick Young, a Kelly Co driver, both testified that as there were no â€œdeadlinesâ€ for delivery of oversized loads due to the restrictions imposed in the permitting processes and the unpredictability of circumstances.Â  Kelly also stated that even though he had made a â€œloose commitmentâ€ to deliver the equipment in Texas on Friday, the commitment was void when the shipper failed to have the goods ready for pickup at the specified time.Â  Kelly gave a description of the process Kelly Co used to obtain permits and testified that Jordan had the Virginia permits when he left the pickup location.Â  Furthermore, Jordan testified that occasionally he would start his trips without the required permits and later stop at a truck stop and have the permits faxed to him.Â  Finally, Young testified that deviating from a specified route due to road construction was not unusual.\r\nGiven the testimony in the record, a reasonable mind could find the conditions and stress that Jordan experienced on this particular trip were the normal, ordinary conditions of his employment.Â  Therefore, there is substantial evidence in the record to support the Commissionâ€™s finding that Jordanâ€™s heart attack was caused by ordinary exertion that is required in the performance of his employment duties in the ordinary and usual manner, without any outward untoward event, and is not compensable as an accident. See Rivers v. V. P. Loftis Co., 214 S.C. 162, 51 S.E.2d 510 (1949).Â  Accordingly, the order of the circuit court is \r\nREVERSED. \r\nGOOLSBY, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-011","title":"State v.

Singleton, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: James Alfred Goff (Husband) appeals from a family court order requiring him to pay $800 per month in permanent periodic alimony and $14,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees to Drenetha Dale Goff (Wife).Â Â  Specifically, Husband contends the trial judge erred in denying his request that the order for alimony be declared null and void because the family court failed to comply with the South Carolina Uniform Veteranâ€™s Act.Â Â  Husband further contends the trial judge erred in awarding Wife attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband, a veteran of the United States Army, married Wife, a high school teacherâ€™s assistant, on December 31, 1975.Â  Before the marriage, on September 24, 1969, Husband was involved in a truck accident, leaving him brain damaged.Â  In January of 1970, the medical board of the Veteranâ€™s Administration (Administration) determined Husband suffered from â€œsevere organic brain syndrome, manifested by a generalized slowing of cerebral function.â€Â  Despite Husbandâ€™s brain damage, the Administration determined Husband had been rated â€œcompetent for VA purposesâ€[1] since October 12, 1970.Â  Husband received monthly disability benefits from the Administration for his inability to work, and his only other source of income was from social security, the combination of which totaled a gross monthly income of $2,600.32.Â  Wife had a gross monthly income of $1,039.60.Â  \r\nOn July 16, 1999, Wife brought a divorce action against Husband based upon adultery, seeking inter alia, alimony and payment of her attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Husband requested a guardian ad litem, and upon the consent of the parties, the trial judge appointed Husbandâ€™s brother, Eddie Goff, as his guardian.Â  \r\nOn September 29, 2000, the trial judge issued a final order and divorce decree in favor of Wife on the grounds of Husbandâ€™s adultery.Â  Â Pursuant to an agreement between Husband and Wife,[2] the trial judge ordered Husband to pay Wife $800 per month in permanent periodic alimony, beginning October 1, 2000.Â  \r\nOn January 13, 2004, Husband brought an action in family court before the same trial judge, seeking to reduce his alimony payments to Wife.Â  Husband further alleged: (1) his guardian ad litem did not have authority to enter into the alimony agreement on his behalf; and (2) the trial judge did not have subject matter jurisdiction to order his Veteranâ€™s Administration funds to be utilized for the payment of alimony because the family court failed to comply with the Uniform Veteranâ€™s Guardianship Act (the Act).Â  Upon these grounds, Husband requested the alimony provisions of the order be declared void ab initio.Â  \r\nIn February of 2004, Husband requested of the Administration that he be rated incompetent and appointed a fiduciary, but the Administration denied his request, again finding him â€œcompetent to handle his VA financial affairsâ€ based on his ability to pass a series of stringent medical tests.Â  The Administration did, however, find him one-hundred percent mentally disabled as a result of his injuries.Â  Yet, due to his level of competency, the Administration never determined it necessary to appoint a guardian for Husband to receive his veteranâ€™s benefits.Â  Â Â \r\nAfter a hearing on Husbandâ€™s complaint on September 15, 2004, the trial judge issued a final order, finding the family court had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action and Husbandâ€™s guardian ad litem was authorized by law to reach decisions in the Husbandâ€™s best interest.Â  The trial judge also denied Husbandâ€™s request for modification of Wifeâ€™s alimony and ordered that Husband pay Wife $14,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSubject matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.Â  State v. Laney, 367 S.C. 639, 649, 627 S.E.2d 726, 732 (2006); Coon v. Coon, 364 S.C. 563, 566, 614 S.E.2d 616, 617 (2005).Â  Issues related to subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time.Â  Laney, 367 S.C. at 649, 627 S.E.2d at 732; see also Tatnall v. Gardner, 350 S.C. 135, 137, 564 S.E.2d 377, 378 (Ct. App. 2002) (â€œThe issue of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time including when raised for the first time on appeal to this Court.â€).\r\nâ€œSubject matter jurisdiction is a question of law for the court.â€Â  Murphy v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 346 S.C. 37, 43, 550 S.E.2d 589, 592 (Ct. App. 2001), overruled on other grounds by Farmer v. Monsanto Corp., 353 S.C. 553, 579 S.E.2d 325 (2003).Â  Questions of law may be decided with no particular deference to the trial court.Â  Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 341 S.C. 320, 327, 534 S.E.2d 672, 675 (2000).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Alimony\r\nHusband contends the trial judge erred in denying his request that the portion of the final order requiring him to pay alimony to Wife be declared null and void.Â  Husband specifically contends the trial judge erred in failing to find the family court did not have subject matter jurisdiction because it never notified the Administration of the divorce hearing as required by the Act.Â  We disagree and find subject matter jurisdiction is not implicated.\r\nÂ  â€œSubject matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.â€Â  State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 100, 610 S.E.2d 494, 498 (2005).Â  The lack of subject matter jurisdiction may not be waived, even if the parties consent to the waiver.Â  Id.Â  By statute, the family court has subject matter jurisdiction to award alimony; therefore, even if the family court failed to comply with the notice requirements of the Act, the failure would not divest the family court of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420 (14).Â  Â Because subject matter jurisdiction is not implicated, any complaint Husband had with regard to the notice requirements of the Act being followed needed to be timely raised to the trial judge in order to be preserved for review.Â  See Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Partnership, 359 S.C. 505, 510-11, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004) (â€œIt is well settled that, but for a very few exceptional circumstances, an appellate court cannot address an issue unless it was raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.â€). Â Husbandâ€™s argument regarding the Act comes four years after alimony was ordered in this case.Â  Accordingly, it is not preserved for our review.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nHusband next contends that if we reverse the trial judgeâ€™s order as to the validity of the alimony award, we should also reverse the award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Because we have affirmed the trial judge decision with regard to alimony, we affirm the award of attorneyâ€™s fees as well.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the trial judgeâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., and BEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] â€œCompetent for VA purposesâ€ indicates Husbandâ€™s competency to handle his own finances provided him by the Administration.Â  \r\n[2] Husband and Wife agreed that if Wife was successful on her claim against Husband for adultery, she would receive permanent periodic alimony of $800 per month, commencing October 1, 2000.Â  Husband and Wife, along with Husbandâ€™s guardian, considered the agreement to be fair.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-013","title":"Department of Social Services v.

Fraley, Jr., Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-013\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2007 â€“ Filed January 11, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Stephen M. Bingman, of Spartanburg, for Appellant.\r\n        DeborahÂ  Murdock, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Christopher George M. (Father) appeals the family courtâ€™s termination of his parental rights to C.M., S.J.M., and K.M. (collectively â€œthe Childrenâ€). We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn December 9, 2003, the Childrenâ€™s mother, Rhonda M. (Mother), was arrested.Â  Two days later, on December 11, 2003, the Children were taken into custody by the Department of Social Services (the Department).Â  Father was incarcerated at this time.Â  \r\nMother and Father were married on December 5, 1997.Â  As a result, Father is the presumptive legal father of S.J.M. and C.M.[2]Â  However, Mother named him as the potential biological father of only one of the children, S.J.M.Â  She claimed Chris H.[3] and Thomas Bill S. fathered K.M. and C.M., respectively.Â  A paternity test indicated Thomas Bill S. is C.M.â€™s biological father.Â  \r\nOn February 2, 2004, the family court held a removal hearing.Â  Because of Fatherâ€™s incarceration, a guardian ad litem represented Father at this hearing.Â  Father did not contest the Departmentâ€™s removal of the Children.Â  The family court entered an order with the consent of all parties for removal of the Children.Â  The family court further noted Father agreed to a submitted treatment plan which required Father to â€œcontact [the Department] upon his release from prison.Â  If he wants custody of his minor child or children, he must first request and complete a DSS treatment plan.â€Â  \r\nFather was released from prison around June 25, 2004.Â  After his release, Fonda Chandler, the Childrenâ€™s foster care caseworker, set up an appointment to discuss a treatment plan for Father, but Father did not show up for the meeting. Â On July 30, Father underwent a hair test for drugs and tested positive for cocaine and benzos.Â  A related urine test was found altered.Â  Pursuant to court order, he was required to take another urine and hair test in November.Â  The urine test came back negative, however, Father did not take the court-ordered hair test. \r\nIn February 2005, police arrested Father for two counts of larceny of a firearm, breaking and entering, two counts of possession of a firearm by a felon, two counts of probation violation, two counts of obtaining property by false pretenses, and larceny after breaking and entering.Â  Father was incarcerated again as of February 23, 2005.Â  \r\nOn March 23, 2006, the family court held a hearing for the termination of parental rights (TPR) of Father, Thomas Bill S., Chris H., John Doe, Richard Roe, and Mother.Â  Mother voluntarily relinquished her parental rights in the Children.Â  Thomas Bill S. appeared at the hearing, but did not oppose the relief requested by the Department.Â  Father, who was still incarcerated, challenged TPR through a guardian ad litem.Â Â Â  \r\nAt the TPR hearing, Chandler testified Father did not take steps to reunify himself with the Children during the eight month period in which he was not incarcerated.Â  She further explained Father made no attempt to financially support the Children, did not visit them on a consistent basis, and was not able to maintain a stable environment for the Children.Â  \r\nThe family court terminated Fatherâ€™s parental rights to the Children, holding (1) Father failed to remedy the conditions which caused the Childrenâ€™s removal from his home within six months of the adoption of a placement plan; (2) the Children lived outside Fatherâ€™s home for more than six months and, during this time, Father willfully failed to visit the Children; (3) the Children lived outside of Fatherâ€™s home for more than six months and, during this time, Father willfully failed to support the Children; (4) Father is not the biological father of C.M. and C.M.â€™s welfare would best be served by TPR; (5) Father has a diagnosable condition of drug addiction unlikely to change within a reasonable time; (6) the Children had been in foster care for fifteen of the twenty-two months before the hearing; and (7) TPR is in the Childrenâ€™s best interest.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§20-7-1572 (2)-(6), (8) (Supp. 2005) (providing the bases for TPR).Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn a TPR action, the best interests of the children are the paramount consideration.Â  Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Before parental rights can be forever terminated, the grounds for the termination must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 608, 582 S.E.2d 419, 423 (2003).Â  In an appeal from a TPR, an appellate court may review the record and make its own determination whether the grounds for termination are supported by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Id. at 609, 582 S.E.2d at 423.Â  Despite this broad scope of review, the appellate court is not required to disregard the findings of the family court, as the family court is in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and assign weight to their testimony.Â  Id. Â This degree of deference is especially true in cases involving the welfare and best interests of minor children.Â  Ex parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 62, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652&nbsp;(2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Termination of Parental Rights\r\nFather first contends the family court erred in terminating his parental rights because the court erroneously determined (1) the Children were removed from his home, (2) that he did not visit the Children, (3) that he did not support the Children, (4) that he has a diagnosable condition unlikely to change in a reasonable time, and (5) that his rights should be terminated as to C.M. based on the finding he is not the childâ€™s biological father. Â We decline to address these issues because Father does not dispute the termination of his parental rights on the alternate basis that the minor children had been in foster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months at the time of the hearing.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(8) (Supp. 2005) (permitting TPR where a child has been in foster care under the responsibility of the State for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months). Â Because Father does not refute this finding, the courtâ€™s determination that Fatherâ€™s parental rights should be terminated under section 20-7-1572(8) is the law of the case.Â  See Charleston Lumber Co. v. Miller Housing Corp., 338 S.C. 171, 175, 525 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2000) (holding an unappealed ruling is the law of the case);Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Seegars, 367 S.C. 623, 628, n. 3, 627 S.E.2d 718, 721, n.3 (2006) (ruling unappealed grounds for TPR are law of the case). Further, our courts have held that a finding pursuant to section 20-7-1572(8) alone is sufficient to support a termination of parental rights. Â S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Sims, 359 S.C. 601, 608, 598 S.E.2d 303, 307 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  See also Charleston County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. King, 369 S.C. 96, ____, 631 S.E.2d 239, 241 (2006) (holding, where parent failed to appeal ruling that child had been in foster care for fifteen of most recent twenty-two months, one statutory ground for TPR had been met and the appellate court need only consider whether termination of parental rights was in the best interest of the child).\r\nII.Â  Best Interests of the Children\r\nFather next maintains the family court erred in failing to make specific findings of fact supporting its decision that TPR was in the best interest of the Children.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 26(a), SCRFC provides that â€œ[a]n order or judgment pursuant to an adjudication in a domestic relations case shall set forth the specific findings of fact and conclusions of law to support the courtâ€™s decision.â€Â  However, an appellate court may make an independent review of the record to make findings of fact when the family courtâ€™s order fails to make such findings in compliance with Rule 26(a).Â  Bull v. Smith, 299 S.C. 123, 126, 382 S.E.2d 905, 906-07&nbsp;(1989).\r\nWe first note the family court orally included specific grounds supporting its finding TPR is in the best interest of the Children.Â  The family court stated:\r\n\r\n  As to [Mother], I find that she voluntarily relinquished her rights and, based on the childrenâ€™s excitement about the possibility of adoption, and the plan to put them back together, with the prospective adoptive parents possibly being available, I find itâ€™s in their best interests and I will terminate [Motherâ€™s] parental rights.\r\n\r\nWith respect to Father, the family court found TPR is â€œin the best interests for the same reason as [for Mother] . . . .â€Â  \r\nAdditionally, we find clear and convincing evidence compels a finding TPR is in the Childrenâ€™s best interest.Â  First, Motherâ€™s counsel indicated Mother believed TPR and adoption would be in the Childrenâ€™s best interest, resulting in Motherâ€™s relinquishment of her own parental rights.Â  Second, the Childrenâ€™s caseworker, Chandler, testified she believed TPR and adoption would be in the Childrenâ€™s best interest.Â  Third, Chandler testified the Children were well-adjusted in their foster home, adoption recruitments had been successful, the Department found a pre-adoptive home for the Children, and the Children would be placed together during pre-adoption.Â  The Department was working for the Children to be adopted together, and the Children were excited about this possibility because of the continuing bond they shared.Â Â  \r\nAdditionally, Chandler testified Father did not work toward reunification with the Children, make financial or material contributions to support them, visit on a consistent basis, or show himself capable of providing a stable environment for the Children.Â  Finally, the Childrenâ€™s guardian ad litem confirmed the Children were well adjusted at that time, they were excited at the prospect of being adopted together, and agreed TPR would be in their best interest.Â  Based on this evidence, we hold clear and convincing evidence compels a conclusion TPR and adoption is in the Childrenâ€™s best interest.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the family courtâ€™s decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] See Chandler v. Merrell, 291 S.C. 224, 226, 353 S.E.2d 133, 134&nbsp;(1987) (â€œEvery child born in wedlock is presumed to be legitimate.â€).Â  Although the current marital status of Mother and Father is unknown, Mother had filed for divorce at the time of the TPR hearing.Â  \r\n[3] The record shows the Department had legal documentation showing that in June 2001, a Chris H.H. changed his name to Christopher George M. The Department has no proof whether Chris H. does or does not exist, but Chris H.H. shows the same date of birth as Father.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-014","title":"Evans v.

Hughston, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-014\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2007 â€“ Filed January 11, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Darryl D. Smalls, of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\n        Daniel A. Beck, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  COMTRAK, Inc. (COMTRAK), and Great West Casualty Company, Inc. (Carrier)[1] appeal the circuit courtâ€™s order entering judgment in favor of Wesley Evans (Evans) for payment of workerâ€™s compensation benefits.Â  We affirm.[2]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn January 27, 2004, Evans was injured in a motor vehicle accident while driving a truck for COMTRAK.Â  Evans sought temporary total and permanent partial disability benefits for injuries sustained to his head, shoulder, left arm, neck, and back.Â  COMTRAK denied the claim asserting Evans was an independent contractor and not an employee.Â  \r\nThe single commissioner entered an order on December 21, 2004, in which he found Evans was an employee and entitled to benefits.Â  The commissioner awarded temporary total disability benefits from the date of the injury until October 24, 2004, the date on which Evans reached maximum medical improvement, and ordered payment of all causally-related medical expenses.Â  The commissioner assigned Evans a forty percent permanent partial disability rating to his left upper extremity and awarded him the requisite benefits. \r\nCOMTRAK appealed to the Appellate Panel.Â  By order dated July 7, 2005, the Appellate Panel unanimously affirmed the decision of the single commissioner and adopted his order in its entirety. \r\nDuring the pendency of COMTRAKâ€™s appeal to the circuit court, Evans moved for an entry of judgment for payment of his awarded benefits.Â  Without a hearing, the circuit court entered judgment on September 16, 2005. Â This appeal followed.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nCOMTRAK argues the circuit court erred in issuing the order of judgment.Â  Specifically, COMTRAK asserts an entry of judgment is inappropriate and unnecessary because it has been making weekly benefit payments and has the financial ability to continue these payments.\r\nIn support of its argument, COMTRAK relies on section 42-17-70 of the South Carolina Code.Â  This section provides:\r\n\r\n  Any party in interest may file in the court of common pleas of the county in which the injury occurred a certified copy of a memorandum of agreement approved by the Commission, an order or decision of the Commission, an award of the Commission unappealed from or an award of the Commission affirmed upon appeal, whereupon such court shall render judgment in accordance therewith and notify the parties. Such judgment shall have the same effect and all proceedings in relation thereto shall thereafter be the same as though such judgment had been rendered in a suit duly heard and determined by such court. But if the judgment debtor shall file a certificate duly issued by the Commission, showing compliance with Â§ 42-5-20,[3] with the clerk of the court in the county in which such judgment is docketed, such clerk shall make upon the judgment roll an entry showing the filing of such certificate which shall operate as a discharge of the lien of such judgment and no execution shall be issued thereon. But if at any time there is default in the payment of any installment due under the award set forth in such judgment the court may, upon application for cause and after ten daysâ€™ notice to the judgment debtor, order the lien of such judgment restored and execution or other proper process may be immediately issued thereon for past-due installments and for future installments as they may become due.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-17-70 (1985) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nFrom what we can glean from the scant record and the partiesâ€™ briefs, the only point of contention is whether a judgment should have been entered to ensure COMTRAKâ€™s obligation to make weekly payments through Carrier for Evansâ€™ awarded benefits.Â  Both parties agree that COMTRAK was required by statute and case law interpreting the applicable statutes to pay Evans weekly benefits after the Appellate Panelâ€™s award.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-17-60 (Supp. 2005) (â€œIn case of an appeal from the decision of the commission on questions of law, the appeal does not operate as a supersedeas and thereafter the employer is required to make payment of the award involved in the appeal or certification until the questions at issue have been fully determined in accordance with the provisions of this title.â€); Case v. Hermitage Cotton Mills, 236 S.C. 515, 533, 115 S.E.2d 57, 66 (1960) (â€œWe construe Section 72-356 (precursor to section 42-17-60) as requiring payment, after the expiration of the thirty-day supersedeas period and during the pendency of the employerâ€™s appeal to the circuit court . . . not of such additional amounts, but only of the weekly compensation accruing after the date of the Commissionâ€™s award.â€); McLeod v. Piggly Wiggly Carolina Co., 280 S.C. 466, 472, 313 S.E.2d 38, 41 (Ct. App. 1984) (â€œSections 42-17-60 and 42-17-70 allow the payment of weekly compensation accruing after the date of the Commissionâ€™s award.â€).Â Â  Â \r\nBecause Evans claimed that COMTRAK was not fulfilling its payment obligation, he was within his right, pursuant to section 42-17-70, to move for the circuit court to enter judgment after the Appellate Panel issued its order.Â  Pursuant to the statutory mandate, the court properly entered judgment based on Evansâ€™ motion.Â  \r\nAlthough COMTRAK places great significance on the entry of this judgment, our appellate courts have characterized the statutorily-mandated entry of judgment as â€œministerial rather than judicial.â€ Â Thus, it is important to note the entry of the judgment has no affect on the merits of the underlying award of benefits claim.Â  See Wall v. C. Y. Thomason Co., 232 S.C. 153, 156, 101 S.E.2d 286, 288 (1957) (discussing section 72-357 (precursor to section 42-17-70) and stating â€œ[t]he language of the section is mandatory; and the rendition of judgment in such case is ministerial rather than judicial, for the award is subject to review only by the appeal procedure . . . .â€); McCants v. West Virginia Pulp &amp; Paper Co., 223 S.C. 467, 470, 76 S.E.2d 614, 616 (1953) (discussing section 72-357 and stating â€œ[t]he entry of a judgment is merely a ministerial act and for the purposes of notice, lien, and enforcementâ€). \r\nGiven that Evans was within his statutorily-created right to move for a judgment, we fail to see what remedy this court can provide for COMTRAK.Â  If COMTRAK is correct in its claim that it has been paying Evansâ€™ weekly benefits, it may discharge the judgment at issue by presenting to the clerk of court a certificate of compliance issued by the Commission.Â  If the judgment is discharged and COMTRAK becomes in default in the payment of Evansâ€™ weekly benefits, Evans may move to have the lien of the judgment restored to secure past-due and future payments.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause the circuit court properly entered judgment in compliance with section 42-17-70, we affirm the courtâ€™s order.Â  Our decision, however, should not be construed as expressing any opinion as to the merits of the underlying claim for workerâ€™s compensation benefits.Â  We reiterate the entry of judgment is ministerial in nature and is not determinative of any future appeal arising from Evansâ€™ claim for benefits.Â  Finally, we emphasize that COMTRAK is not without remedy given it may move to discharge the judgment by filing with the clerk of court a certificate of compliance issued by the Commission.\r\nAccordingly, the order of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Although both parties appeal the circuit courtâ€™s order, we refer to the Appellants solely as â€œCOMTRAKâ€ in the interest of clarity and brevity.\r\n[2] Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3]Â Â  Section 42-5-20 of the South Carolina Code outlines the requirements for an Employerâ€™s need for liability insurance or proof of its ability to pay awarded benefits.Â  This code section provides in pertinent part:Â  \r\n\r\n  Every employer who accepts the provisions of this title relative to the payment of compensation shall insure and keep insured his liability thereunder in any authorized corporation, association, organization, or mutual insurance association formed by a group of employers so authorized or shall furnish to the commission satisfactory proof of his financial ability to pay directly the compensation in the amount and manner and when due as provided for in this title.\r\n\r\nS.C.

Gregory, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-015\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2007 â€“ Filed January 11, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Jack D.

Friedman, of Hilton Head Island, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this lien foreclosure action, Kenneth C. and Madeleine R. Arata (the Aratas) appeal the circuit courtâ€™s order granting Village West Horizontal Property Regime (Regime) summary judgment.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Aratas own Unit 6 in Phase 3 of the Village West Horizontal Property Regime.Â  Unit 6 is located in the Spinnaker building, one of five buildings within the Regime.Â  In March 2005, the Regime filed a complaint against the Aratas for failure to pay an assessment.Â  In addition, the Regime filed a lis pendens against Unit 6. \r\nOn March 21, 2005, the Regime filed an amended complaint, asserting a lien against Unit 6 and asking the circuit court to foreclose on the lien.Â  The Aratas answered, admitting they did not pay the assessment.Â  However, they averred the Regimeâ€™s By-Laws prevented the Regime from collecting the assessment.Â  Furthermore, the Aratas counterclaimed for slander of title.Â  Subsequently, the Aratas moved to amend their answer to assert a counterclaim for an accounting of settlement proceeds from a lawsuit involving construction defects in the Spinnaker building.[2]Â  \r\nThe Regime moved for summary judgment, attaching a memorandum and several exhibits.Â  The Regime explained it initiated two lawsuits from 1994 to 1997.Â  The first suit involved construction-related defects in the Spinnaker building.Â  This lawsuit settled for $300,000.Â  The second lawsuit involved construction-related defects in the other four buildings within the Regime.Â  The second lawsuit settled for $7 million.[3]Â  \r\nAccording to the Regime, the total recovery from these suits did not cover the entire expense of repairing the buildings.Â  As a result, the Regimeâ€™s board assessed all of the unit owners according to their percentage of ownership in the Regime.Â  The Aratas refused to pay this assessment. Â After the Regime filed the present foreclosure action, the Aratas sought a temporary injunction to stop the Regimeâ€™s repair of the buildings. Â This request was denied.Â  \r\nThe Aratas filed a motion in opposition to summary judgment.Â  They argued the second lawsuit, relating to defects in all of the Regimeâ€™s buildings except the Spinnaker building, resulted in a deficiency.Â  Consequently, the Aratas contended, the Regime improperly levied the assessment to cover the deficiency as to those buildings only.Â  Furthermore, they reiterated their position that the Regimeâ€™s By-Laws prohibited such an assessment. \r\nAfter a hearing, the circuit court granted summary judgment to the Regime and ordered foreclosure of the lien.Â  The Aratas moved for reconsideration, which the circuit court denied.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard which governs the circuit court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  David v. McLeod Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 247, 626 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2006); Bennett v. Investors Title Ins. Co.,&nbsp;370 S.C. 578, ___, 635 S.E.2d 649, 654-55&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Law v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corrs., 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648 (2006); Wells v. City of Lynchburg, 331 S.C. 296, 302, 501 S.E.2d 746, 749&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1998).Â  If triable issues exist, those issues must go the jury. Mulherin-Howell v. Cobb, 362 S.C. 588, 595, 608 S.E.2d 587, 591 (Ct. App. 2005). Â \r\nSummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Law, 368 S.C. at 434, 629 S.E.2d at 648; BPS, Inc. v. Worthy, 362 S.C. 319, 325, 608 S.E.2d 155, 159 (Ct. App. 2005). Â On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below. Sloan v. Friends of Hunley, Inc., 369 S.C. 20, 25, 630 S.E.2d 474, 477 (2006); see also Schmidt v. Courtney, 357 S.C. 310, 317, 592 S.E.2d 326, 330 (Ct. App. 2003) (stating that all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed strongly against the moving party).\r\nWhen further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify application of the law, summary judgment is not appropriate.Â  Gadson v. Hembree, 364 S.C. 316, 320, 613 S.E.2d 533, 535 (2005); Miller v. Blumenthal Mills, Inc., 365 S.C. 204, 220, 616 S.E.2d 722, 729&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  Even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them, summary judgment should be denied.Â  Nelson v. Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n, 362 S.C. 1, 5, 605 S.E.2d 744, 746&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  However, when plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ, summary judgment should be granted. Â Rife v. Hitachi Constr. Mach. Co., Ltd., 363 S.C. 209, 214, 609 S.E.2d 565, 568 (Ct. App. 2005); Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 518, 595 S.E.2d 817, 822 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nThe party seeking summary judgment has the burden of clearly establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Â Jones v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 364 S.C. 222, 228, 612 S.E.2d 719, 722 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  The moving party may discharge the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact by pointing out the absence of evidence to support the nonmoving partyâ€™s case. Â Lanham v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of S.C., Inc., 349 S.C. 356, 361, 563 S.E.2d 331, 333 (2002).Â  Once the party moving for summary judgment meets the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary support for the opponentâ€™s case, the opponent cannot simply rest on mere allegations or denials contained in the pleadings.Â  Bennett v. Investors Title Ins. Co.,&nbsp;370 S.C. 561, ___, 635 S.E.2d 660, 665&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).Â  Rather, the nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial. Â Rife, 363 S.C. at 214, 609 S.E.2d at 568.\r\nThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder. Â Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 438 (2003); Rumpf v. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 386, 393, 593 S.E.2d 183, 186 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Because it is a drastic remedy, summary judgment should be cautiously invoked to ensure that a litigant is not improperly deprived of a trial on disputed factual issues. Â Helena Chem. Co. v. Allianz Underwriters Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 631, 644, 594 S.E.2d 455, 462 (2004); B &amp; B Liquors, Inc. v. Oâ€™Neil, 361 S.C. 267, 270, 603 S.E.2d 629, 631 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. The By-Laws\r\nThe Aratas contend the circuit court erred in holding that the Regimeâ€™s By-Laws did not prohibit the assessment.Â  Alternatively, they maintain the By-Laws are ambiguous.Â  In response, the Regime argues both the By-Laws and statutory authority compel the construction defects be repaired through a pro rata assessment.Â  We agree with the Regime.\r\nThe operative documents that govern a horizontal property regime constitute a contract between the association and its individual members.Â  Swanson v. Parkway Estates Townhouse Assâ€™n, 567 N.W.2d 767, 768&nbsp;(Minn. App. 1997); see also Reyhani v. Stone Creek Cove Condo. II Horizâ€™l Prop. Regime, 329 S.C. 206, 211-13, 494 S.E.2d 465, 468-69&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997) (applying principles of contract law to interpret the operative documents of a horizontal property regime); Houck v. Rivers, 316 S.C. 414, 416, 450 S.E.2d 106, 108&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1994) (interpreting provisions of a master deed using contract law).Â  The interpretation of a clear and unambiguous agreement is a question of law for the court.Â  Pearson v. Church of God, 325 S.C. 45, 54, 478 S.E.2d 849, 853&nbsp;(1996); Stribling v. Stribling,&nbsp;369 S.C. 400, ___, 632 S.E.2d 291, 293&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).\r\nIn construing a contract, the primary objective is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties.Â  D.A. Davis Constr. Co., Inc. v. Palmetto Props., Inc., 281 S.C. 415, 418, 315 S.E.2d 370, 372&nbsp;(1984); Ellie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 93, 594 S.E.2d 485, 493&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004); see also Brady v. Brady,&nbsp;222 S.C. 242, 246, 72 S.E.2d 193, 195&nbsp;(1952) (â€œAgreements should be liberally construed so as to give them effect and carry out the intention of the parties.â€).Â  The partiesâ€™ intention should first be determined from the language of the contract.Â  Schulmeyer v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., 353 S.C. 491, 495, 579 S.E.2d 132, 134&nbsp;(2003); Gilbert v. Miller, 356 S.C. 25, 30, 586 S.E.2d 861, 864&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003); Goode v. St. Stephens United Methodist Church, 329 S.C. 433, 445, 494 S.E.2d 827, 833&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997); see also Bruce v. Blalock,&nbsp;241 S.C. 155, 161, 127 S.E.2d 439, 442&nbsp;(1962) (â€œIt is axiomatic that the intent and purport of a written contract or agreement has to be gathered from the contents of the entire agreement and not from any particular clause or provision thereof.â€).\r\nIn general, if the contract is unambiguous, clear, and explicit, it must be construed according to the terms the parties have used, and the terms are to be taken and understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense.Â  Ingram v. Kaseyâ€™s Assocs., 340 S.C. 98, 110, 531 S.E.2d 287, 293&nbsp;(2000); Jordan v. Sec. Group, Inc., 311 S.C. 227, 230, 428 S.E.2d 705, 707&nbsp;(1993); see also Superior Auto. Ins. Co. v. Maners, 261 S.C. 257, 263, 199 S.E.2d 719, 722&nbsp;(1973) (â€œ[T]o ascertain the intention of an instrument resort is first to be had to its language, and if such is perfectly plain and capable of legal construction, such language determines the force and effect of the instrument.â€).Â  When an agreement is clear and capable of legal interpretation, the courtâ€™s only function is to interpret its lawful meaning, discover the intention of the parties as found within the agreement, and give effect to it.Â  Heins v. Heins, 344 S.C. 146, 158, 543 S.E.2d 224, 230&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001).Â  The court must enforce an unambiguous contract according to its terms, regardless of the contractâ€™s wisdom or folly, or the partiesâ€™ failure to guard their rights carefully.Â  McPherson v. J. E. Sirrine &amp; Co.,&nbsp;206 S.C. 183, 206, 33 S.E.2d 501, 510&nbsp;(1945); Ellie, 358 S.C. at 93-94, 594 S.E.2d at 493.\r\nArticle IX of the Regimeâ€™s By-Laws provides, in pertinent part:\r\nARTICLE IX\r\nRECONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR\r\n\r\n  \r\n    In the event of casualty loss or damage to the Property, the [Regimeâ€™s] Board of Directors shall be responsible for applying the proceeds of all casualty insurance to the repair or reconstruction of the Property in accordance with the provisions of this ARTICLE IX.Â  Reconstruction or repair shall be mandatory unless two-thirds or more of the Property is destroyed or substantially damaged.Â  If two-thirds or more of the Property is destroyed or substantially damaged, reconstruction shall not be mandatory . . . . If less than two-thirds of the Property is destroyed or substantially damaged, then such Property shall be repaired in the following manner:\r\n    . . . \r\n    (3) If the insurance proceeds paid to the Board are insufficient to cover the cost of reconstruction, the deficiency shall be paid as a special assessment by the Unit Owners whose units are being reconstructed or repaired in proportion to the damage done to their respective Units.\r\n    (4) The insurance proceeds received by the Board . . . and any special assessments collected to cover a deficiency in insurance shall constitute a construction fund from which the Board . . . shall disburse payment of the costs of reconstruction and repair.Â  The first disbursements from the construction fund shall be insurance proceeds; and if there is a balance in the fund after payment of all costs of reconstruction and repair, it shall be distributed to the Unit Owners who paid special assessments in proportion to their payments.Â  Any balance remaining after such distribution shall be retained by the Association.\r\n  \r\n\r\nMoreover, Article X of the Regimeâ€™s By-Laws reads, in relevant part:\r\nARTICLE X\r\nINSURANCE TRUST\r\n\r\n  \r\n    In the event of casualty loss to the Property, all insurance proceeds indemnifying the loss or damage shall be paid jointly to the Board of Directors as Insurance Trustee . . . . The Board of Directors, acting as Insurance Trustee, shall receive and hold all insurance proceeds in trust for the purposes stated in this ARTICLE X, and for the benefit of the Association, the Unit Owners, and their respective mortgagees in the following share:\r\n    . . . \r\n    (2) Insurance proceeds paid on account of loss or damage to less than all of the Units, when the damage is restored, shall be held for the benefit of Unit Owners of the damaged Units . . . in proportion to the costs of repairing each damaged unit.\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe Aratas argue these provisions provide the proper procedures to collect and use funds obtained from the above-referenced lawsuits.Â  Moreover, they assert the Regime could not assess unit owners in the Spinnaker building to pay for reconstruction and repair costs with respect to the other buildings in the Regime.Â  To support their argument, they specifically reference Article IXâ€™s language referring to â€œcasualty loss or damage to the Propertyâ€ and the fact that the adjective â€œcasualtyâ€ is omitted from later references to loss and insurance within Article IX.\r\nInitially, we hold Articles IX and X of the Regimeâ€™s By-Laws have no application to the present case. Â A contract is read as a whole document so that one may not, by pointing out a single sentence or clause, create an ambiguity.Â  S. Atl. Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Middleton, 356 S.C. 444, 447, 590 S.E.2d 27, 29&nbsp;(2003); see also Yarborough v. Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co., 266 S.C. 584, 592, 225 S.E.2d 344, 349&nbsp;(1976) (â€œThat construction will be adopted which will give effect to the whole instrument and to each of its various parts and provisions, if it is reasonable to do so.â€); J.T.M. Co., Inc. v. Vane, 283 S.C. 512, 516, 323 S.E.2d 794, 796&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1984) (â€œIn determining the intent and purport of a contract, a court should not look solely to one clause read in isolation from the rest of the document; rather, it should consider the contents of the whole instrument.â€).\r\nIn this case, the opening paragraph of Article IX refers to â€œcasualty loss or damage to the Property . . .â€ and â€œthe proceeds of all casualty insurance.â€Â  The remainder of Article IX guides the board in how to apply these insurance proceeds and what procedure to follow if the proceeds are deficient.Â  The clear, unambiguous intent of this provision is to provide the board guidance in the event of a casualty loss or damage caused by a casualty.\r\nMoreover, we agree with the Regime that other provisions within the Regimeâ€™s Master Deed and By-Laws specifically allow the assessment.Â  Article V, Section (e) of the Master Deed reads, in relevant part:\r\n\r\n  The obligations of all Unit owners with regard to assessments for common expenses and the maintenance and repair of the individual Units shall be as provided in the By-Laws of the [Regime] . . . .\r\n\r\nArticle VII, Section 6(c) of the Regimeâ€™s By-Laws provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  All maintenance, repair and replacement to the common elements as defined in the Master Deed, the painting and decorating of the exterior doors and exterior window sash and the washing of exterior glass shall be made by the [Regimeâ€™s] Board [of Directors] . . . and shall be charged to the Unit Owners as a common expense . . . .\r\n\r\nArticle VIII, Section (a) of the Master Deed defines the Regimeâ€™s common elements, which include â€œthe foundations, roofs, perimeter walls, walls and partitions separating units, [and] load-bearing floors . . . .â€Â  \r\nThe Regimeâ€™s Master Deed and By-Laws clearly provide for the assessment of all unit owners for construction defects with respect to any of the buildings within the Regime.Â  Additionally, this language complies with statutory law and the general purpose behind horizontal property regimes.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-31-240 (Supp. 2005) (â€œThe co-owners of the apartments are bound to contribute pro rata . . . toward the expenses of administration and of maintenance and repair of the general common elements.â€); Sterling Village Condo., Inc. v. Breitenbach, 251 So.2d 685, 688&nbsp;(Fla. App. 1971) (â€œEvery man may justly consider his home his castle and himself as the king thereof; nonetheless his sovereign fiat to use his property as he pleases must yield, at least in degree, where ownership is in common or cooperation with others.â€).\r\nII. Other Issues\r\nThe Aratas contend several material issues of fact exist about the proceeds from settlement of the above-referenced lawsuits.Â  Furthermore, they maintain the issue of whether the assessment would be used to pay for repair to buildings other than the Spinnaker buildings is a genuine issue of material fact for a jury.Â  Additionally, they assert the circuit court prematurely granted summary judgment because little discovery had taken place and their motion to amend was still pending.Â  Based on our conclusion that the Regimeâ€™s Master Deed and By-Laws unambiguously allow such an assessment, we need not address these issues.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the Regimeâ€™s assessment complied with its operative documents.Â  Moreover, we find the Regime followed the procedure required by statute and the general considerations behind horizontal property regimes with respect to the assessment in this case.Â  Further, these conclusions render it unnecessary for this court to address the Aratasâ€™ remaining contentions.Â  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The record does not reveal whether the circuit court heard or ruled upon this motion.\r\n[3] Although the facts alleged in the Regimeâ€™s memorandum are not supported by admissible evidence, the Aratas alleged the same scenario in their appellate brief.Â  Moreover, as will be shown, these facts are immaterial to the circuit courtâ€™s decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-016","title":"State v.

Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General Derrick K. McFarland, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Ralph Hoisington, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Â Â Anthony L. Mann appeals his convictions for murder and armed robbery.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn January 7th, 2002, Mann was riding in an automobile with Michael Crumb and Eric Zack, when he was paged by Beverly Blake. Â Over a cellular phone, Blake explained to Mann that her roommate, Dante Tobias, was trying to â€œpimp her outâ€ against her will.Â  She wanted to pack her belongings and leave Tobias and requested the men pick her up in their vehicle.Â  Additionally, Blake informed Mann that Tobias kept money and drugs inside a safe in his house, and the two made plans to steal those items from Tobias.Â  Mann, Crumb, and Zack first visited the residence of Peter Davies, where Mann obtained a gun.Â  Before proceeding to Tobiasâ€™ home, the three men stopped to allow Mann to test-fire the newly acquired weapon.Â  Â Â \r\nMann entered Tobiasâ€™ house first, followed shortly thereafter by Crumb, with Zack remaining in the car.Â  Upon entering the living room, Crumb saw Mann had the gun pointed to Tobiasâ€™ head and was arguing with him as to whether or not he was trying to prostitute Blake.Â  Following Mannâ€™s demand, Tobias provided the combination to the safe; however, neither Blake nor Crumb was successful in their attempts to open it.Â  Eventually, Blake and Crumb filled trash bags with items from around the house and left.Â  As Crumb and Blake sat in the car, they heard a gunshot and a scream from Tobias.Â  Mann emerged from the home and informed the others he had shot Tobias in the leg.Â  However, contrary to what Mann told his comrades, Tobias lay dead.Â  He had not been hit in the leg but was struck by a bullet in his back that exited through his chest.Â  \r\nThe group then returned to Daviesâ€™ house, where they divided the loot.Â  Mann warned Zack and Crumb not to tell anyone about the dayâ€™s events.Â  At Daviesâ€™ request, Terrance Hudson appeared at the home and provided a ride to Davies, Blake, and Mann.Â  Although Hudson dropped all three of his passengers off at another vehicle in a parking lot some distance away, eventually all four of them ended up at the residence of Nicole Oâ€™Connell.Â  Before leaving Oâ€™Connellâ€™s with Mann and Davies, Blake told her friend, Tiffany Mercado, that Mann would be giving her a ride to Mercadoâ€™s house.Â  Blake was never heard from or seen alive again.\r\nOn January 13th, 2002 the body of Beverly Blake was discovered in a secluded, wooded area.Â  She had been shot three times in the head, once in the back, and once in the chest.Â  Based on the condition of her body, the temperature, and other elements, her death was estimated as having occurred on or around January 7th.Â  She appeared to be wearing the same clothes she was wearing when last seen. \r\nMann was later arrested and indicted for the armed robbery and murder of Tobias, as well as the murder of Blake.Â  The circuit court judge allowed the two murders to be joined in a single trial because, â€œthe evidence for the murder of victim number one, Dante Tobias, [was] necessary for a full presentation of the case charging the defendant of murder of victim number two, Beverly Blake.â€Â  The judge later stated, â€œBecause of the first, he had to do the second.â€Â  \r\nThe trial court held two hearings concerning the prosecutionâ€™s request that it be allowed to consolidate Mannâ€™s indictments.Â  The State argued the evidence of crimes was intertwined and that evidence of either murder was necessary to prove the other.Â  Conversely, Mann argued the two murders did not arise out of the same chain of circumstances and that South Carolina does not allow the joinder of two murder cases.\r\nThe trial judge ultimately found:\r\n\r\n  The allegations are victim number one lived with victim number two.Â  Victim number two and the defendant conspired to rob victim number one.Â  Victim number two heard a shot while the defendant was the only person with victim number two and the defendant shot victim number two . . . . \r\n  The evidence that the State uses to prove the murder of victim number one, Dante Tobias, will most likely be admissible to show that the defendantâ€™s alleged motive for murdering victim number two, Beverly Blake, thatâ€™s under the theory the State advances.Â  Of course, in a preliminary determination pretrial if that turns out to not to be the case, I will have to take up any appropriate remedies at that time. \r\n\r\nIn addition to testimony establishing the facts as described above, a number of witnesses testified as to Mannâ€™s behavior and particular statements made after the death of Tobias.Â  Zack testified Mann told him that he planned to â€œget rid ofâ€ Blake.Â  Shannon Keyes, a friend of Mannâ€™s, received a call from Mann following the murders.Â  According to Keyes, Mann indicated, â€œ[he and Blake] went go do something and it didnâ€™t turn out the way it was supposed to, and he had to do what he had to and he had to lay low for awhile.â€Â  \r\nDustin James testified Mann indicated to him that he killed Blake because she knew Mann killed Tobias.Â  Mann also stated that Blake was â€œin the woods.â€Â  Similarly, Krystal Lackey testified Mann said he â€œfound out that [Blake] had given some information and supposedly had told the police, and his words were that he had to kill that n-gg-r bitch.â€Â Â  \r\nFor a time, Mervin Menier shared a jail cell with Mann.Â  Consistent with the testimony from other witnesses, Menier testified Mann told him that he shot Tobias.Â  He also told Menier he shot and killed Blake in a secluded area that same night because she was getting nervous.Â  \r\nAt the conclusion of the Stateâ€™s case, Mann moved for a mistrial on the basis the indictments were improperly joined.Â  After extensive discussions on the issue, the trial judge denied this motion.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nMann avers the trial judge erred by allowing the State to consolidate the two murder charges into a single trial and claims the prosecution established no logical connection between the two homicides.Â  He contends joinder was prejudicial because it is likely the jury inferred a criminal disposition based on evidence he may have been involved in the murder of Blake, and, on that basis alone, found Mann guilty of Tobiasâ€™ murder. Â We disagree.\r\nWhen offenses charged in separate indictments are of the same general nature involving connected transactions closely related in kind, place, and character, the trial court has the discretion to order the indictments tried together, but only so long as the defendantâ€™s substantive rights are not prejudiced.Â  State v. Cutro, 365 S.C. 366, 374, 618 S.E.2d 890, 894 (2005); State v. Sullivan, 277 S.C. 35, 282 S.E.2d 838 (1981).Â  â€œ[J]oinder of offenses in one trial is â€˜proper if the offenses (1) are of the same general nature or character and spring from the same series of transactions, (2) are committed by the same offender, and (3) require the same or similar proof.â€™ â€Â  State v. Simmons, 352 S.C. 342, 351, 573 S.E.2d 856, 861 (Ct. App. 2002) (citations omitted).Â  Offenses are considered to be of the same general nature where they are inter-connected.Â  State v. Harry, 321 S.C. 273, 468 S.E.2d 76 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  In determining joinder, the trial judge need not find clear and convincing evidence of the charges.Â  Cutro, 365 S.C. at 374, 618 S.E.2d at 894. Â If the trial judge finds there is no substantial evidence to submit any one the joined charges to the jury, the defendant may move for a mistrial on the basis of unfair prejudice resulting from joinder.Â  Cutro, 365 S.C. at 375, 618 S.E.2d at 894; see also State v. Tate, 286 S.C. 462, 334 S.E.2d 289 (1985) (finding prejudice when two forgery charges, not provable by the same evidence, were improperly consolidated). Â Â Â Â Â \r\nApplying this criterion to the case at bar, there was no error.Â  Simply having two murders occur sequentially within a short span of time and within a small geographic boundary does not in itself determine that the crimes can be prosecuted in a single trial.Â  See State v. Middleton, 288, S.C. 21, 23-24, 339 S.E.2d 692, 693 (1986).Â  However, in this case the State demonstrated much more than a close proximity in time and place. Â These offenses were of the same general nature and character and sprung from the same series of transactions.Â  Overwhelming evidence was presented that Mann committed the two murders.Â  See Simmons, 352 S.C. 342, 573 S.E.2d 856; State v. Carter, 324 S.C. 383, 386, 478 S.E.2d 86, 88 (Ct. App. 1996). Â Evidence of the killing of Tobias was highly relevant in a review of Blakeâ€™s murder.Â  In a Lyle context, evidence of one murder has a relevance to the other and is indicative of motive and intent. Â See State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923).Â  Thus, similar proof was necessary to find that Mann committed both crimes.Â  \r\nMann cannot show any prejudice resulting from the trial judgeâ€™s decision to allow the State to consolidate the charges against him.Â  The trial court charged the jury that â€œeach indictment charges a separate and distinct offense.Â  You must decide each indictment on the law and evidence applicable to it.Â  A defendant may be acquitted or convicted on any or all of the offenses charged.Â  You will be asked to write a separate verdict as to each indictment.â€Â  Accordingly, there was no prejudice.\r\nWhen placed in context of the Stateâ€™s evidence, Blakeâ€™s knowledge of Tobiasâ€™ shooting provided a motive for her murder.Â  At most, the events formed a seamless chain of actions played out over the span of a few hours, and at the least, the murders are intimately connected as the fallout from the first provided the very necessity for the second.Â  On the basis of the substantial evidence presented in this case, the trial judge properly allowed the charges to be consolidated and correctly denied Mannâ€™s motion for a mistrial on the basis of improper joinder.\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nAccordingly, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by allowing the State to consolidate all the offenses in a single trial, and Mannâ€™s convictions are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-017","title":"SC Department of Social Services v.

Brogdon, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-018\r\nHeard December 8, 2006 â€“ Filed January 11, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        D. Malloy McEachin, Jr., of Florence, for Appellant.\r\n        C. Craig Young, of Florence, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Following a non-jury trial, St. Luke Methodist Church appeals the trial judgeâ€™s granting of a prescriptive easement over its cemetery, arguing that Respondentsâ€™ use has not been continuous over twenty years and that the sanctity of the cemetery should trump any prescriptive easement Respondents may have.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nSt. Luke cemetery in Florence County has been in existence for over a hundred years.Â  The one-acre cemetery is surrounded on all sides by property belonging to others.Â  Blue Stone Drive is the right-of-way the church has always used to get from Sardis Highway to its property. Respondents, the owners and residents of the properties surrounding the cemetery, as well as their predecessors in title, have always used Blue Stone Drive as the exclusive means to access their properties.Â  In fact, because Blue Stone Drive is the only street that leads to the property behind the cemetery, it is also traversed by mail carriers and emergency personnel.Â  Florence County has regularly maintained Blue Stone Drive since at least 1973.Â  Â Â \r\nWhen Lynn Browder, one of the respondents, registered her plat in 1994 in order to build her house, she listed a fifty-foot right-of-way from her land to Sardis Highway, wholly outside of St. Lukeâ€™s cemetery property.Â  This right-of-way is impassible, however, due to a fish pond, a canal ditch, and the wetland quality of the land.Â  All of the materials used to build Lynn Browderâ€™s house were brought in on Blue Stone Drive.Â  Also, Browderâ€™s motherâ€™s mobile home and the two mobile homes on Respondent Robert McGeeâ€™s property were brought in on Blue Stone Drive.Â  \r\nUntil the commencement of this action, St. Luke never made any attempt to restrict neighboring residentsâ€™ use of Blue Stone Drive. Â Neither Respondents nor their predecessors in title ever sought permission to use Blue Stone Drive.Â  \r\nFor over thirty-five years, there has been a fence around three sides of the cemetery, including the side along the back edge.Â  St. Luke does not claim to have erected the fence.Â  More recently, a portion of the fence at the back corner of the property has been rolled up, allowing traffic on Blue Stone Drive to cross the back of the cemetery property.Â  By 1995, traffic on Blue Stone Drive had begun crossing the back of the cemetery property, and the roadway has migrated close to several gravesites near the rear boundary of the cemetery.Â  The potential desecration of the gravesites is St. Lukeâ€™s primary concern in bringing this lawsuit.Â  \r\nIn his order, the trial judge noted that Respondents could reach their property without following the present path of Blue Stone Drive through the back of the cemetery.Â  He reasoned that redirecting traffic would eliminate any desecration of gravesites, while keeping Blue Stone Drive open for county maintenance and available for continued access to Respondentsâ€™ properties.Â  The trial judge found that Respondents have obtained a prescriptive easement to access their properties by way of Blue Stone Drive.Â  Pursuant to the courtâ€™s equitable powers, the trial judge relocated the road so as to provide access in the manner least burdensome to the church.Â  Thus, he ordered that traffic on Blue Stone Drive be redirected such that it veers off the cemetery property sixty-two feet before the back edge.Â  St. Luke appeals this ruling.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe determination of the existence of an easement is a question of fact in a law action and subject to an â€œany evidenceâ€ standard of review when tried by a judge without a jury.Â  Slear v. Hanna, 329 S.C. 407, 410, 496 S.E.2d 633, 635 (1998).Â  The question of the extent of the easement is equitable.Â  Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 323, 487 S.E.2d 187, 190 (1997).Â  On appeal from an action in equity, tried by the judge alone, without a reference, the appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its views of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Doe v. Clark, 318 S.C. 274, 276, 457 S.E.2d 336, 337 (1995); Thames v. Daniels, 344 S.C. 564, 571, 544 S.E.2d 854, 857 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  This broad scope of review does not require the appellate court to disregard the findings below.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981); Satcher v. Satcher, 351 S.C 477, 482, 570 S.E.2d 535, 538 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Nor is the appellant relieved of its burden of convincing the court that the trial judge committed error in his findings.Â  Pinckney v. Warren, 344 S.C. 382, 387, 544 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2001); Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  St. Luke argues the trial judge erred in concluding that the Respondents have a prescriptive easement over the cemetery.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nTo establish an easement by prescription, there must be continued and uninterrupted use or enjoyment of the right for the full period of twenty years, identity of the thing enjoyed must be proven, and use must be adverse or under claim of right.Â  Pittman v. Lowther, 363 S.C. 47, 50, 610 S.E.2d 479, 480 (2005).Â  St. Luke argues that the twenty-year time period element was not established because evidence was presented which indicated that prior to 1994, Blue Stone Drive was used exclusively as an access to the cemetery.Â  In support of this contention, St. Luke points to the testimony of the church members and to photographs taken in 1970 showing a fence along the propertyâ€™s southwest corner. Â Â However, the church members did not testify that Blue Stone Drive was never used to access residences before 1994.Â  They testified that traffic from the road had not threatened the gravesites until then.Â  Further, there were numerous witnesses who testified to continuous and exclusive use of Blue Stone Drive by the Respondents and their predecessors to access their properties from Sardis Highway since before 1973.Â  The existence of the fence along the back of the property in 1970 does not refute this testimony; rather it indicates that traffic along Blue Stone Drive changed course over the years such that it later began to cross the back of the property where the fence once stood.Â  The trial judgeâ€™s order does not provide for a prescriptive easement across the area where that fence stood; instead it provides that the easement ends sixty-two feet in front of that area.Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  St. Luke also argues equity favors preserving the sanctity of the cemetery, relying on testimony that the traveled portion of Blue Stone Drive is seven feet from one headstone.Â  However, these arguments ignore the actual nature of the trial judgeâ€™s order.Â  His order in effect steers the traffic on Blue Stone Drive clear of the threatened gravesites.Â  \r\nSt. Luke argues that plats registered by Respondents Lynn Browder and Robert McGee imply that Respondents had other access to their properties and were not using Blue Stone Drive for ingress and egress as a matter of right.Â  However, the testimony of Respondents is that Blue Stone Drive has always been the only way they have accessed their properties, and the only way they can access their properties.Â  Furthermore, Florence County has maintained the road for public access since at least 1973, and there exist several residences with addresses on Blue Stone Drive.Â  The existence of plats describing other accesses to Respondentsâ€™ properties does not obviate the evidence supporting Respondentsâ€™ claim.Â  \r\nIn addition, the testimony at trial supports a finding that Respondents have used Blue Stone Drive for a continuous and uninterrupted period in excess of twenty years.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause we find there is ample evidence to support the trial judgeâ€™s finding of a prescriptive easement over St. Lukeâ€™s cemetery in favor of Respondents, and because his modification steers traffic away from the gravesites, we hold the circuit court order should be\r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nHEARN, C.

J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] St. Luke also argued that the trial judge erred in finding that Blue Stone Road has been a public road since 1973.Â  However, in light of our disposition of this case, we need not address this argument.Â  See Whiteside v.

Johnson, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-019\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2007 â€“ Filed January 11, 2007Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Byron Putnam Roberts, of Columbia, for Appellants\r\n        Stephen Benjamin Samuels, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â In this workersâ€™ compensation case, the circuit court affirmed the decision of the Appellate Panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission, in which the Appellate Panel held Stephen M. Whisonant had not reached maximum medical improvement and was entitled to temporary total disability compensation and additional medical treatment.Â  The employer, Protection Services, Inc., and carrier, Travelers Indemnity Company (collectively Protection Services) appeal.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nWhisonant was involved in an admitted work-related accident in the early hours of January 11, 2001.Â  While he was returning from a job site, the truck he was driving was rear-ended by a tractor trailer on I-95.Â  Whisonantâ€™s truck flipped up in the air, rolled twice, and landed on its top.Â  Whisonant was knocked unconscious by the accident.Â  He was treated at the Colleton County Medical Center emergency room for a neck injury, a concussion, contusions on his chest, and abrasions on his left flank. Â He declined x-rays but had a ct scan on his head.Â  Later that day he was treated at Doctorâ€™s Care, the company health care facility. Â During a follow-up visit, he was diagnosed with cervical strain.Â  At Whisonantâ€™s February 17, 2001 visit, the doctor noted the cervical strain was resolved and released Whisonant with no restrictions.Â  Â Whisonant did not miss any work due to the accident.Â  He continued working for Protection Services until his employment was terminated for unrelated reasons in August of 2001.\r\nWhisonant testified that when he was released by Doctorâ€™s Care, he had a stiff neck and had trouble turning his head when backing up trucks.Â  Around two weeks after being released, he started experiencing numbness in his right arm when driving or keeping his arm in the same position for extended periods of time. Â His symptoms continued to worsen over time. \r\nOn January 25, 2002, Whisonant was treated at Richland Memorial Hospital, where he related that since his accident he had been bothered by neck pain and occasional numbness in his right arm.Â Â  He sought treatment at the emergency room on March 25, 2002 complaining of extreme pain in his right shoulder.Â  Whisonant explained this was the first time he experienced so much pain that he had to go to the emergency room.Â  He was diagnosed with Right C6 radiopathy and set up for an MRI.Â  The MRI report stated â€œImpression is of Multilevel degenerative disc, facet, and uncovertebral spondylosis.â€Â Â Â Â  \r\nWhisonant was seen again at Doctorâ€™s Care on June 27, 2002.Â  The doctor noted Whisonant had palpable spasm and pain.Â  He placed the following restrictions on the return to work form:Â  â€œNo lifting more than 10 pounds.Â  No operation of hazardous or fast-moving machinery, no driving.Â  Ground level work only, no ladder or heights.Â  No repeated bending, stooping, squatting, pushing, jerking, twisting or bouncing.Â  No continuous standing.Â  Minimum [walking], climbing (includes stairs).Â  No overhead lifting.â€Â  In addition, the doctor referred Whisonant to a neurosurgeon.Â  However, Protection Services refused to pay for Whisonant to see the neurosurgeon.Â  \r\nAt his attorneyâ€™s suggestion, Whisonant saw an orthopedist, Dr. Donald R. Johnson, II, on September 22, 2002.Â  Dr. Johnson recommended an injection and if that was not successful within three weeks or so then he have surgical decompression.Â  He opined Whisonant had not reached maximum medical improvement (MMI).Â  Whisonant was prescribed Celebrex, Tylox, and Neurontin for the pain.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nWhisonant filed a Form 50 seeking additional medical treatment for his neck and right arm plus temporary total disability from June 27, 2002 until he reaches maximum medical improvement.Â  The single commissioner held Whisonant had not reached maximum medical improvement.Â  He found Whisonant was entitled to additional medical treatment as directed by Dr. Johnson as the authorized treating physician and ordered Protection Services to reimburse Whisonant for the previous treatment by Dr. Johnson.Â  The commissioner ruled Whisonant was entitled to receive temporary total disability compensation from June 27, 2002, the date the authorized treating physician put him on light duty, and continuing on a running award of $421.78 until further order of the commission.Â  The Appellate Panel of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission affirmed the single commissionerâ€™s decision and incorporated by reference the single commissionerâ€™s findings of fact and conclusions of law.Â  The circuit court affirmed the Appellate Panelâ€™s order.Â  This appeal followed. Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  This court can reverse or modify the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision only if the appellantâ€™s substantial rights have been prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law or is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 454, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (Supp. 2006).Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor evidence viewed from one side, but such evidence, when the whole record is considered, as would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the [Appellate Panel] reached.â€Â  Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.Â  The possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions does not prevent the Appellate Panelâ€™s conclusions from being supported by substantial evidence.Â  Tiller v. Natâ€™l Health Care Ctr., 334 S.C. 333, 338, 513 S.E.2d 843, 845 (1999).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nProtection Services argues the circuit court erred in affirming the finding of the Appellate Panel that Whisonantâ€™s present complaints were causally related to his work-related accident.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œIf a medical expert is unwilling to state with certainty a connection between an accident and an injury, â€˜the expression of a cautious opinionâ€™ may support an award if there are facts outside the medical testimony that also support an award.â€ Tiller v. Natl.Â  Health Care Ctr., 334 S.C. 333, 340, 513 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1999);Â  Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 286, 519 S.E.2d 583, 593 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œProof that a claimantÂ  sustained an injury may be established by circumstantial and direct evidence where circumstances lead an unprejudiced mind to reasonably infer the injury was caused by the accident.Â  However, such evidence need not reach such a degree of certainty as to exclude every reasonable or possible conclusion other than that reached by the Commission.â€Â Â  Tiller, 334 S.C. at 341, 513 S.E.2d at 846-47 (citations omitted).Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nProtection Services contends Whisonant failed to present evidence of even a cautious medical opinion to support the award.Â  We disagree with this interpretation of Whisonantâ€™s doctorâ€™s diagnosis.Â  Whisonantâ€™s orthopedist, Dr. Johnson, wrote in his evaluation of Whisonant:Â  â€œI cannot ascertain whether the accident is causally related to his current symptoms other than by the history given to me by the patient.â€Â  He related Whisonantâ€™s history and then stated, â€œI suspect that he had an aggravation of a pre-existing condition.â€Â  \r\nWe find Dr. Johnson did in fact render a cautious opinion that Whisonantâ€™s current symptoms were causally related to the accident.Â  The aggravation of a pre-existing condition is a compensable injury.Â  See Brown v. R.L. Jordan Oil Co., 291 S.C. 272, 275, 353 S.E.2d 280, 282 (1987) (stating when a pre-existing condition or disease is accelerated or aggravated by injury or accident arising out of and in the course of the employment, the resulting disability is a compensable injury).Â Â  Dr. Johnson merely qualified his opinion that his diagnosis was based on the history Whisonant provided him.Â  The Appellate Panel found Dr. Johnsonâ€™s report with Whisonantâ€™s history of no symptoms before the accident but symptoms afterwards was sufficient to prove a causal connection between the accident and the injury.Â  We find substantial evidence in the record to support this finding.Â  \r\nProtection Services contends Whisonantâ€™s failure to report neck or arm problem to Doctorâ€™s Care during his visits immediately after the accident, to other doctorâ€™s during visits for other ailments, or to his supervisors evidences his claim for an accident-related injury lacks credibility.Â  Â Â \r\nIn the order adopted in its entirety by the Appellate Panel, the single commissioner found:\r\n\r\n  While I am concerned about the gap in treatment and the periods where Claimant saw doctors for unrelated reasons and did not complain of neck or arm problems, this can be attributed to the progressive nature of Claimantâ€™s problems and Claimantâ€™s quiet nature.Â  I find Claimant is not a person who complains about his problems.Â  This is based on the medical records, Claimantâ€™s testimony and the testimony of Venus Mace.Â  \r\n\r\nÂ â€œThe final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the [Appellate Panel].Â  It is not the task of this Court to weigh the evidence as found by the [Appellate Panel].â€Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000) (citations omitted). \r\nAs the Appellate Panel found Whisonant credible and there is substantial evidence in the record to support its finding that his injuries were causally connected to his work-related accident, we hold the circuit court did err in affirming the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision.Â  \r\nProtection Services argues the circuit court erred in affirming the finding of the Appellate Panel that Whisonant is not at MMI and is entitled to temporary total disability benefits since June 27, 2002.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nDr. Johnson stated in his report, â€œI certainly donâ€™t feel [Whisonant] has reached maximum medical improvement.â€Â  He recommended a cervical injection and if that was not successful in three weeks or so, surgical decompression and fusion at three levels.â€Â  The Appellate Panel considered this report, as well as his other doctorâ€™s records, in concluding Whisonant had not reached MMI.Â  We find this conclusion is clearly supported by substantial evidence.Â  \r\nAt the end of its brief, Protection Services argues against an award of benefits because â€œClaimant was terminated from his job with the employer for violation of company policy and he has since voluntarily removed himself from the labor market.â€[2] Â Protection Services failed to raise this argument in its request for commission review.Â  Therefore, the argument is not properly before this court. Rodney v. Michelin Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 515, 517, 466 S.E.2d 357, 358 (1996) (stating arguments not raised to the workersâ€™ compensation commission are not preserved for appeal);Â  Creech v. Ducane Co., 320 S.C. 559, 564, 467 S.E.2d 114, 117 (Ct. App. 1995) (stating only issues within the application for review are preserved for appeal to the commission).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the above stated reason, the order of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and BEATTY, JJ. concur.Â  Â Â  Â \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Whisonant testified that after his employment with Protection Services was terminated, he attempted to look for other employment until his unemployment benefits ended.Â  He then gave up trying to find another job as he could not find anything that that he could do considering his injuries. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-020","title":"SC Department of Social Services","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayUnPubOpinion.cfm?caseNo=2007-UP-020","description":null,"date":"2007-01-11","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n.MsoFootnoteText\r\n\t{font-size:10.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoFootnoteReference\r\n\t{vertical-align:super;}\r\n.MsoBodyTextIndent\r\n\t{text-align:justify;\r\n\ttext-autospace:none;\r\n\tfont-size:12.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:black;\r\n\tfont-weight:bold;}\r\n.documentbody1\r\n\t{font-family:Verdana;}\r\n.Section1\r\n\t{page:Section1;}\r\n.Section2\r\n\t{page:Section2;}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n.style1 {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS OPINION HAS NO PRECEDENTIAL VALUE.Â  IT SHOULD NOT BE CITED OR RELIED ON AS PRECEDENT IN ANY PROCEEDING EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY RULE 239(d)(2), SCACR.\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        South Carolina Department of Social Services, Respondent,\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nv.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Mother, Father, and Child, Defendants,\r\n        Of whom Father is Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From York County\r\nÂ Robert E.

Cox, of Rock Hill, for Appellant.\r\n        Cherie Teat Barton, of York, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Father appeals the family courtâ€™s order terminating his parental rights.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nFather is Childâ€™s biological father. Â This appeal arises from the family courtâ€™s termination of Fatherâ€™s parental rights on January 31, 2006, for the following statutory grounds: (1) Child has been in foster care under the responsibility of the State for more than fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months; (2) Child has been out of the home for six months following the adoption of a placement plan and Father has not remedied the conditions that caused removal; and (3) Child has been out of the home and Father failed to support or visit Child for a period of six months prior to the commencement of the termination of parental rights proceedings. Â \r\nChild was born in 1992.Â  When Child was two, Father left the household[2] and Child continued to reside with Mother until August 29, 2002.Â  In August, when Child was almost ten years old, he was removed from Motherâ€™s custody due to allegations of physical neglect stemming from Motherâ€™s substance-abuse problems.Â  Despite his young age, Child was out late at night and Child had been charged with several incidents by law enforcement including cruelty to animals, larceny, simple assault, arson, theft from a motor vehicle, vandalism, aggravated assault, and burglary second-degree.Â  Child has been in foster care continuously since his removal.Â  At the time of Childâ€™s removal from Motherâ€™s custody, Father had violated probation by using drugs and was incarcerated at the Moss Justice Center.Â  Subsequently, he enrolled in a twenty-eight day in-patient substance abuse center.\r\nAfter his release, the Department of Social Services (the Department) and Father entered into a treatment plan that required Father to (1) pay child support in the amount of $50 per month; (2) obtain suitable housing; (3) obtain employment; (4) contact Keystone to schedule an assessment for substance abuse; and (5) participate in family counseling until released by Childâ€™s therapist.\r\nFor a brief period from August 29, 2002 until March 31, 2003, Father was not incarcerated.Â  During that time, he had four visits with Child and two phone conversations.Â  After those visits, Childâ€™s behavior would regress.Â  Because of this, Childâ€™s guardian ad litem recommended that Child not visit with Father.Â  At that time the Department was not in agreement with the guardian ad litemâ€™s recommendation. Â The Department later ended Fatherâ€™s visitation privileges in March 2003 based on the recommendation of Childâ€™s therapist.\r\nIn June of 2005, the Department filed an action for termination of Fatherâ€™s parental rights.Â  During the hearing, Father testified that after he completed a substance abuse program, he again used drugs.Â  He testified he used drugs for â€œabout ten years, twenty years.â€Â  Further, Father testified that prior to Childâ€™s removal Mother had told him she wanted him to take custody of Child, and that he told Mother he first needed some time to get â€œstraight.â€Â  During this time, however, Father violated his parole by using drugs and was incarcerated.Â  He also testified that while he was not incarcerated, he was employed but did not pay child support.Â  The record shows Father made two child support payments during the entire time Child has been in the Departmentâ€™s custody.Â  Father testified that during his incarceration, after his parole was revoked for the second time, he did not seek any visitation with Child.Â  At the time of the termination hearing, Father was incarcerated and eligible for parole in November or December of 2006.\r\nFollowing the hearing, the family court concluded, pursuant to section 20-7-1572 of the South Carolina Code, that termination of Fatherâ€™s parental rights was warranted under the circumstances and that such termination was in Childâ€™s best interest.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2005).Â  Specifically, the family court found Child had been removed from Fatherâ€™s home for more than six months and Father failed to visit or support Child.Â  Additionally, the family court found Father failed to remedy the conditions that led to Childâ€™s removal; namely, he does not have a home in which to house Child and by Fatherâ€™s own admission it would take six to eight months after his release from prison before he would have a home for Child.Â  The family court noted Child had been in foster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months and had been waiting three years for Father to provide a home for him, but Father has been unable to do so.Â  Moreover, the family court found that Father has not completed counseling.Â  Based on the foregoing, the family court ordered the termination of Fatherâ€™s parental rights.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn a termination of parental rights case, â€œthe appellate court has jurisdiction to examine the entire record to determine the facts according to its view of the evidence.â€ Â Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing Richland County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Earles, 330 S.C. 24, 32, 496 S.E.2d 864, 866 (1998)).Â  In our examination, the best interest of the child is our paramount consideration.Â  Id. at 579, 578 S.E.2d at 735.Â  Additionally, the grounds for termination of parental rights must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999) (citing Greenville County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Bowes, 313 S.C. 188, 194, 437 S.E.2d 107, 110 (1993)).Â  â€œOur broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the findings below or ignore the fact the trial judge was in a better position to assess the credibility of the witnesses.â€Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 293, 547 S.E.2d 506, 509 (Ct. App. 2001) (citing Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996)).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Father argues the family court erred in terminating his parental rights.Â  He contends termination was not warranted based on the facts and circumstances of this case.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 20-7-1572 of the South Carolina Code governs actions for termination of parental rights in South Carolina and provides â€œ[t]he family court may order the termination of parental rights upon a finding of one or more of the [statutory] grounds and a finding that termination is in the best interest of the child . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2005).\r\nThe family court found Child had been out of the home for six months following the adoption of a placement plan and Father had not remedied the conditions that caused the removal.Â  See id. Â§ 20-7-1572 (2) (â€œThe child has been removed from the parent . . . , has been out of the home for a period of six months following the adoption of a placement plan by court orderÂ  . . . , and the parent has not remedied the conditions which caused the removal.â€).Â  Father did not appeal this finding; therefore, it is the law of the case.Â  See South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v.

Rauch Wise and Ted Ben Wyndham, of Greenwood, for Appellant\r\n        David Alan Wilson and T. Preston Reid, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this divorce action, William Stuart (Husband) appeals the family courtâ€™s order finding his dental practice was marital property,Â  failing to give Husband credit for payments he made on the principal of the lake house, and awarding Jeannie Stuart (Wife) attorneysâ€™ fees and $45,960 per year in alimony. Â We reverse in part and affirm in part. \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife married on November 1, 1991.Â  During the marriage, the parties acquired their primary residence.Â  Husband contributed $21,000.00 of non-marital funds toward the down payment, and Wife contributed $201,000.00 of non-marital funds toward the down payment and $32,868.91 of non-marital funds toward improvements.Â  The parties also acquired a lake house during their marriage.Â  Wife paid $37,500.00 as a down payment for the lake house.Â  Husband made all the payments on both homes during the marriage.Â  These payments resulted in the principal owed on the primary residence being reduced by $50,000.00 and the principal owed on the lake house being reduced by $32,710.21.Â  Prior to the marriage, Husband established a dental practice in 1975 or 1976, and in 1988 he moved the practice to Greenville.\r\nIn June 2001, the parties separated.Â  On March 22, 2002, Wife filed a complaint seeking separate maintenance and support, equitable distribution of marital property and debts, alimony, and attorneysâ€™ fees and suit costs.Â  Later, Wife moved to amend her complaint to seek a divorce on the ground that the parties had lived separate and apart for one-year.Â  Husband consented to the amendment, and the family court granted the motion.Â  By order issued February 25, 2004, the family court granted Wife a divorce, ordered Husband to pay Wife permanent alimony in the amount of $3,830.00 per month and $7,000.00 toward Wifeâ€™s attorneysâ€™ fees, and divided the partiesâ€™ marital property and debts.Â  This appeal follows.Â Â  Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family court, this court has the authority to find the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992). We are not, however, required to disregard the findings of the family court, which saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Haselden v. Haselden, 347 S.C. 48, 58, 552 S.E.2d 329, 334 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe Dental Practice\r\nHusband claims the family court erred by declaring the dental practice to be marital property.Â  We agree.\r\nGenerally, property acquired by either party prior to the marriage is nonmarital property. Â Greene v. Greene, 351 S.C. 329, 338, 569 S.E.2d 393, 398&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-70473(2) (Supp. 2001).Â  Nonmarital property may be transmuted into marital property if: (1) it becomes so commingled with marital property as to be untraceable; (2) it is jointly titled; or (3) it is utilized by the parties in support of the marriage or in some other manner so as to evidence an intent by the parties to make it marital property. Â Pool v. Pool, 321 S.C. 84, 88, 467 S.E.2d 753, 756 (Ct. App. 1996), affâ€™d as modified, 329 S.C. 324, 494 S.E.2d 820 (1998).Â  The spouse claiming transmutation bears the burden of showing that, during the marriage, the parties themselves regarded the property as the common property of the marriage. Â Id. Â The mere use of separate property to support the marriage, without some additional evidence of intent to treat the property as marital, is not sufficient to establish transmutation. Â Id.\r\nThe evidence presented shows Husband owned the dental practice before the marriage, and the parties did not intend to treat the dental practice as marital property.Â  The family court held that Husband had started his dental practice three years before his marriage to Wife.Â  Our reading of the record reveals that Husband had been in practice for twelve to thirteen years prior to the time the family court set for the beginning of his practice.Â  We find that Husband moved his preexisting practice three years prior to his marriage to Wife.Â  Under either interpretation, it is clear that Husband owned the practice before he married Wife.Â  Husband testified that the couple never considered the dental practice to be marital property and kept their monies separate.Â  Wife presented no evidence to show there was an intent to treat the dental practice as marital property.Â  Therefore, she has failed to carry her burden and has not shown the dental practice was transmuted into marital property.Â  The dental practice should not have been considered as marital property for equitable distribution. Â Â Â Â Â \r\nPrincipal Payments for the Lake House\r\nHusband claims the family court erred by failing to give him credit for payments made to the principal owed on the lake house when he was given credit for similar payments on the primary residence.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe division of marital property is in the family courtâ€™s discretion and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of that discretion. Â Craig v. Craig, 365 S.C. 285, 290, 617 S.E.2d 359, 361 (2005). Â Section 20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) provides fifteen factors for the family court to consider in apportioning marital property and affords the family court with the discretion to give weight to each of these factors â€œas it finds appropriate.â€ On appeal, this court looks to the overall fairness of the apportionment, and it is irrelevant that this court might have weighed specific factors differently than the family court. Â Greene v. Greene, 351 S.C. 329, 340, 569 S.E.2d 393, 399 (Ct. App. 2002). Â Absent an abuse of discretion, the apportionment of marital property will not be disturbed on appeal. Â Deidun v. Deidun, 362 S.C. 47, 58, 606 S.E.2d 489, 495 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nThe family court awarded Wife the primary home valued at $500,000.00 and mortgage debt of $50,000.00 for that home.Â  This resulted in a net equity of $450,000.00 to Wife.Â  The family court held that Husband should receive the $21,000.00 he put towards the down payment, the $50,000.00 by which he reduced the principal owed on the primary residence, and $72,500.00 as his share of the increase in equity exceeding his contributions.\r\nThe family court awarded Husband the partiesâ€™ interest in the lake house valued at $107,500.00 and the mortgage debt of $25,000.00 for that home.Â  This resulted in a net equity of $82,500.00 to Husband. Â The family court held that Wife should receive the $37,500.00 she contributed as the down payment and $22,500.00 as her share of the increase in equity exceeding her contributions.Â  The family court adjusted the distribution of the remaining assets to give Husband the remaining $83,500.00 ($143,500.00 Wife owed to Husband minus $60,000.00 he owed to her).Â  Next, the family court calculated the net total of the remaining assets and stated that each party should receive half of the value of the assets.Â  \r\nWife was awarded the primary home; therefore Husband was entitled to receive credit for the payments he had made towards the principal owed on the primary home.Â  Husband was awarded ownership of the coupleâ€™s interest in the lake house.Â  If husband was to receive an additional credit for the payments he made towards the principal owed on the lake house, he would basically be receiving a credit for a payment he made to himself.Â Â  After considering that Husband retained ownership of the coupleâ€™s interest in the lake house, it appears the family court gave each party credit for his or her contributions in a fair and equitable manner.Â  The family court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant Husband credit for payments he made towards the principal owed on the lake house.Â Â  Â Â Â \r\nAttorneysâ€™ Fees\r\nHusband claims the family court erred by awarding Wife attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  We agree.\r\nAttorneysâ€™ fees may be assessed against a party in an action brought in the family court. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(A)(38) (Supp.2005); Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 533, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004). The award of attorneysâ€™ fees is within the discretion of the court. Â Hailey v. Hailey, 357 S.C. 18, 31, 590 S.E.2d 495, 502 (Ct. App. 2003). The trial courtâ€™s decision regarding Â attorneysâ€™ fees will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. Green v. Green, 320 S.C. 347, 353, 465 S.E.2d 130, 134 (Ct. App. 1995). \r\n    In deciding whether to award attorneysâ€™ fees, the family court should consider: (1) each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fees; (2) the beneficial results obtained by counsel; (3) the respective financial condition of each party; and (4) the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living. Upchurch v. Upchurch, 367 S.C. 16, 28, 624 S.E.2d 643, 648-49 (2006). \r\nThe family court found that either party could pay his or her own attorneysâ€™ fees, and neither party would suffer a detriment to his or her standard of living if they had to pay the other partyâ€™s attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  The family court went on to award Wife attorneysâ€™ fees due to her success on the central contested issues of equitable apportionment and alimony.Â Â  Â \r\nUnder these circumstances, we hold the family court erred in ordering Husband to pay Wifeâ€™s attorneysâ€™ fees. Â Considering the partiesâ€™ ability to pay their own fees, the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions, and the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living, we believe Husband and Wife should be responsible for their own attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  Furthermore, the beneficial results achieved at trial and relied on in awarding Wife attorneysâ€™ fees will be greatly reduced by the outcome of this appeal. See Doe v. Doe, 370 S.C. 206,Â Â  , 634 S.E.2d 51, 58 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  \r\nAlimony\r\nHusband claims the family court erred by awarding Wife $45,960.00 per year in alimony.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn award of alimony will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. Â Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 282, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002).Â  When awarding alimony, the family court considers the following thirteen factors set forth in section 20-3-130(C) (Supp.2005) of the South Carolina Code: (1) duration of the marriage; (2) physical and emotional health of the parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4) employment history and earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living established during the marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the parties; (7) current and reasonably anticipated expenses of the parties; (8) marital and nonmarital properties of the parties; (9) custody of children; (10) marital misconduct or fault; (11) tax consequences; (12) prior support obligations; and (13) other factors the court considers relevant.\r\nThe family court stated it had weighed all of the required factors in determining the issue of alimony.Â  In making its decision, the trial court specifically mentioned Wifeâ€™s health, the tax consequences to both parties, the standard of living during marriage, Wifeâ€™s inability to obtain health insurance independently, the earnings and expenses of both parties. Â The family court considered all the applicable factors for determining the issue of alimony, and from our review of the record, we do not find the family court abused its discretion on this issue.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons set forth above, we reverse the family courtâ€™s inclusion of Husbands dental practice as marital property and award of attorneysâ€™ fees to Wife, affirm the family courtâ€™s denial of credit to Husband for payments toward principal owed on the lake house, and affirm the family courtâ€™s award of alimony to Wife.Â  Accordingly, the order of the family court is Â \r\nREVERSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART. \r\nGOOLSBY, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-022","title":"State v.

Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent(s).\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Anthony Smith appeals the trial courtâ€™s denial of his motion to dismiss the charges against him on the basis of a denial of his right to a speedy trial and the trial courtâ€™s denial of his motion to dismiss his 2005 indictments on the basis of excessive pre-indictment delay.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAnthony Smith was arrested on September 17, 2003, for home invasion and robbery. Â On October 21, 2003, and November 18, 2003, Smith was indicted for armed robbery, first degree burglary, and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.Â  Smithâ€™s original attorney was relieved for health reasons in May 2004 and was replaced in June 2004.Â  Smith filed requests to have the charges against him dropped for failure to prosecute in April and July of 2004, and he attempted to contact the clerk of court, judge, and the solicitor about the delay in his trial.Â  On January 5, 2005, Smith was indicted for five counts of attempted armed robbery, two counts of assault and battery with intent to kill, and two counts of armed robbery.Â  Smithâ€™s original indictments and his subsequent nine indictments all arose from the same home invasion and robbery.Â  \r\nIn a pretrial hearing, Smithâ€™s attorney moved to have the charges against Smith dismissed. Â Smithâ€™s attorney argued the charges from the original indictments should be dismissed because Smith had been denied a speedy trial. Â Smithâ€™s attorney did not present any evidence of prejudice, and he simply stated it was not â€œright for someone to sit in jail 16 months for an uncomplicated case.â€ Â Smithâ€™s attorney also moved to dismiss the nine new indictments for excessive pre-indictment delay.Â  Smithâ€™s attorney argued that while â€œthe basic facts had not changedâ€ it was not right to wait â€œ16 months and then go to the grand jury for some more stuff in the same case.â€Â  The trial court denied both motions. Â This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSmithâ€™s did not present any evidence of prejudice, and his main complaint was the amount of time that had passed. Â Therefore, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s denial of Smithâ€™s motions.Â  See State v. Foster,&nbsp;260 S.C. 511, 197 S.E.2d 280 (1973) (explaining that the length of delay is merely a triggering mechanism which brings additional factors into consideration); State v. Tyson, 283 S.C. 375, 323 S.E.2d 770 (1984) (affirming a trial judgeâ€™s denial of a speedy trial motion where there was no detriment other than the incarceration); State v. Brazell, 325 S.C. 65, 480 S.E.2d 64 (1997) (holding there was no violation of the right to a speedy trial where lack of prejudice negated the long delay and, in the context of pre-indictment delay, the defendant has the burden to show the delay caused substantial actual prejudice to his right to a fair trial). Â Therefore, the order of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-023","title":"Pinckney v.

Pinckney, of Cross, Pro Se Appellant.\r\n        N. Keith Emge, Jr., of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Kenneth S. Pinckney appeals the trial courtâ€™s award of summary judgment in favor of Dr. Robert J. Salamon.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn March 11, 2003, Kenneth S. Pinckney received chiropractic treatment for lower back pain from Dr. Robert J. Salamon.Â  After leaving Dr. Salamonâ€™s office, Pinckney experienced great discomfort in his throat, wheezing, difficulty swallowing, and the loss of his voice. Â Pinckney associated the problems in his neck and throat with the care he received from Dr. Salamon, particularly a procedure that involved Pinckney turning his head from side to side while lying on an examination table.\r\nAs a result of his alleged injury, Pinckney filed a medical malpractice lawsuit against Dr. Salamon.Â  The complaint claimed Dr. Salamon was grossly negligent in the care he administered.Â  Additionally, Pinckney alleged Dr. Salamon failed to receive Pinckneyâ€™s informed consent in regard in any treatment that involved his neck and throat.\r\nAfter his visit to Dr. Salamon, Pinckney saw Dr. Robert Marwick, an ear, nose and throat specialist. Â Dr. Marwick evaluated Pinckneyâ€™s condition and, although equivocal in his diagnosis, believed that Pinckney may have a fractured hyoid.Â  In his answer to interrogatories, Pinckney indicated that he intended to call Dr. Marwick as a witness. Â Shortly after the interrogatories were filed, Dr. Marwick stated in a letter to Pinckney: â€œI could not establish a causal connection between your medical condition and any treatment that you had received from a chiropractor.Â  Therefore, I will not be able to help you in your potential case as a witness.â€\r\nPinckney also proffered Dr. Jerald Yaden as an expert witness.Â  However, in his affidavit, Dr. Yaden stated he had no personal knowledge of the injury Pinckney allegedly sustained and that he could not testify to a reasonable degree of professional certainty that Dr. Salamonâ€™s treatment deviated from the standard of care in the field of chiropractics. Â Specifically, Dr. Yaden stated:\r\n\r\n  I have not treated Kenneth S. Pinckney since April of 2001.\r\n  I have no personal knowledge of the alleged injuries sustained by Mr. Pinckney in March of 2003.\r\n  If called to testify in this matter, I could not testify to a reasonable degree of professional certainty that Dr. Salamonâ€™s treatment of Mr. Pinckney deviated from the standard of care in the chiropractic profession or that Dr. Salamonâ€™s treatment of Mr. Pinckney was most probably the cause of the injuries alleged by Mr. Pinckney.\r\n\r\nPinckney listed a number of other physicians who could serve as witnesses.Â  However, upon being subpoenaed, these doctors all indicated they had only treated Pinckney prior to his visit with Dr. Salamon and had no involvement with the injury at issue in this case.\r\nDr. Salamon moved for summary judgment, citing Pinckneyâ€™s failure to proffer expert testimony proving the standard of care had been breached and was the proximate cause of his injury.Â  The master-in-equity granted this motion, to which Pinckney now appeals.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Baughman v. Am. Tel &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 114-15, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545 (1991). Â The moving party may discharge the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact by pointing out the absence of evidence to support the nonmoving partyâ€™s case. Â Lanham v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of S.C., Inc., 349 S.C. 356, 361, 563 S.E.2d 331, 333 (2002).\r\nAlthough â€œthe court must view the facts and inferences therefrom in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party,â€ Bravis v. Dunbar, 316 S.C. 263, 265, 449 S.E.2d 495, 496 (Ct. App. 1994), in order to withstand a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must establish specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial.Â  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986).Â  This court has previously held: \r\n\r\n  A party opposing a properly supported motion for summary judgment, however, may not rest on the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but must set forth or point to specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact.Â  Thus, the existence of a mere scintilla of evidence in support of the nonmoving partyâ€™s position is not sufficient to overcome a motion for summary judgment. \r\n\r\nDickert v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 306 S.C. 311, 313, 411, S.E.2d 672, 673 (Ct. App. 1991) (internal citations omitted), revâ€™d in part on other grounds, 311 S.C. 218, 428 S.E.2d 700 (1993).Â  Thus, the nonmoving party cannot rest solely on its pleadings.\r\nA physician commits malpractice by not exercising that degree of skill and learning that is ordinarily possessed and employed by members of the profession in good standing, acting in the same or similar circumstances. Durham v. Vinson, 360 S.C. 639, 650-51, 602 S.E.2d 760, 766 (2004).Â  In order to recover in a malpractice action, a plaintiff must prove: (1) a duty of care owed to the defendant by the plaintiff; (2) a breach of that duty by a negligent act or omission; and (3) damages proximately resulting from the defendantâ€™s breach. Â Â See Crolley v. Hutchins, 300 S.C. 355, 387 S.E.2d 716 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  Failure to conform to the standard of care must generally be shown by expert testimony, unless the subject matter is within common knowledge and experience.Â  Jernigan v. King, 312 S.C. 331, 440 S.E.2d 379 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\nAs the standard of care owed by chiropractor for the treatment of lower back pain is not within the common knowledge, Pinckney must present expert testimony in order to establish his claim.Â  In regard to negligence, the expert must provide the duty of care owed in treating the condition and that through a negligent act or omission, Dr. Salamon breached this duty, proximately causing Pinckneyâ€™s injury.Â  Similarly, Pinckneyâ€™s claim for lack of informed consent must be proven by expert testimony establishing the professional standard for disclosure for Dr. Salamonâ€™s branch of medicine, the doctor breached that standard in regards to Pinckney, and Pinckney was harmed as a result. \r\nIn the context of medical malpractice, South Carolina has the following burden for showing causation:\r\n\r\n  [W]hen opinions of medical experts are relied upon to establish causal connection of negligence to injury, the proper test to be applied is that the expert must, with reasonable certainty, state that in his professional opinion the injuries complained of most probably resulted from the alleged negligence of the [defendant].\r\n\r\nBillups v. Leliuga, 303 S.C. 36, 40, 398 S.E.2d 75, 77 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  Thus, the â€œtest for the admissibility of expert testimony on a causal connection requires the expert to state that the result most probably came from the cause alleged.â€Â  32 S.C. Juris Witness Â§ 79 (referencing Clark v. Greenville County, 313 S.C. 205, 437 S.E.2d 117 (1993)).Â  Medical expert testimony that the injury â€œpossibly,â€ â€œcould have,â€ or â€œmight haveâ€ resulted from the alleged negligence is insufficient to prove causation.Â  See Billups, 303 S.C. at 40, 398 S.E.2d at 77.\r\nThe uncontested statement of Dr. Marwick, the only physician known to have evaluated Pinckney after visiting Dr. Salamon, was that he cannot meet South Carolinaâ€™s standard for expert testimony pertaining to causation.Â  None of the other doctors Pinckney listed as experts examined him subsequent to the alleged injury.Â  Pinckney failed to proffer any expert testimony regarding a breach of the standard of care or that the breach was the proximate cause of the injury.Â  As a result, there are no genuine issues of material fact as to his causes of action.Â  Because the issue discussed is dispositive, we need not address any other issues.\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nAccordingly, the grant of summary judgment is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-024","title":"State v.

Savitz, III, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry D. McMaster; Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh; Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott; Assistant Attorney General Shawn L. Reeves, all of Columbia; and Solicitor J. Gregory Hembree, of Conway; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Appellant, Samuel Simmons, was indicted for and convicted of armed robbery, assault and battery with intent to kill, grand larceny and criminal conspiracy.Â  Simmons appeals, asserting the trial court erred in overruling his Batson[1] motion.Â  We affirm.[2]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nDuring jury selection, the State exercised five peremptory challenges.Â  Simmons made a Batson motion, challenging the striking of three of those jurors:Â  numbers 92, 36, and 55.Â  The trial court explained to defense counsel following his request for a hearing on the matter that the solicitor was required to present a race or gender neutral explanation for each strike and, if the court found the explanation to be race or gender neutral, it would then look to defense counsel for an explanation as to why it was a racially based strike that was mere pretense. Â \r\nThe solicitor explained juror number 92 and juror number 36 both had criminal convictions.Â  As to number 55, he stated as follows:\r\n\r\n  Juror number 55 was the one that stood up there for a good while I looked over at Ms. Canteen to try to get a signal which I apparently misinterpreted as a strike.Â  She tells me that she was giving me an okay which is not a thumbs up or an okay.Â  But a different signal I interpreted to be a strike.Â  So I struck him because I thought that Ms. Canteen in my office was saying that he would not make a good juror.\r\n  I do not have any other reason because obviously she didnâ€™t have a reason.Â  I only have her as my reason.\r\n\r\nIn response, defense counsel stated he would like to put on the record that, in regard to those three jurors, the solicitor looked over at Ms. Canteen, a member of the solicitorâ€™s office, as well as at law enforcement officer Lieutenant Grayson.Â  He also requested, and was provided, corroboration of the convictions of jurors 92 and 36.Â  \r\nThe trial court found the criminal charges were race neutral explanations.Â  When the court asked counsel if he had any further argument, he replied, â€œNo, sir, Your Honor.Â  And to clarify number 55 is the one that the solicitor said that he took the wrong hand signal I believe.â€Â  The trial judge confirmed this statement, and counsel stated he had â€œno further objections to the jury.â€Â  The trial court then put the following on the record:\r\n\r\n  Based upon that . . . I do not find that the explanation though there was a mistake or an error by the solicitorâ€™s office in number 55, that it is not an error that was grounded in the jurorâ€™s race.Â  I do find that it was merely a common error or mistake by the solicitorâ€™s office.Â  Itâ€™s certain[ly] not a mere [pretextual] argument or reason and certainly do not find that for the other two.Â  Therefore your Batson motion is denied.Â  You have any other arguments?\r\n\r\nCounsel responded that he had no other argument on the matter, and the trial went forward.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Simmons asserts the trial court erroneously denied his Batson motion as to the juror struck based on the misinterpreted hand signal.Â  He argues the State, as the proponent of the strike, was required to offer a facially race-neutral explanation for the strike and failed to do so in this instance because the State may not meet its burden by merely asserting a third person made the decision to strike and communicated this decision to the solicitor.\r\nâ€œThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the striking of a venire person on the basis of race or gender.â€Â  State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 615, 545 S.E.2d 805, 810 (2001).Â  â€œâ€˜The purposes of Batson and its progeny are to protect the defendantâ€™s right to a fair trial by a jury of the defendantâ€™s peers, protect each venirepersonâ€™s right not to be excluded from jury service for discriminatory reasons, and preserve public confidence in the fairness of our system of justice by seeking to eradicate discrimination in the jury selection process.â€™â€Â Â Â  State v. Rayfield, 369 S.C. 106, ___, 631 S.E.2d 244, 247 (2006) (quoting State v. Haigler, 334 S.C. 623, 628-29, 515 S.E.2d 88, 90 (1999)).Â  â€œBoth the State and defendants are prohibited from discriminatorily exercising a peremptory challenge of a prospective juror.â€Â  Id.Â Â  When a party strikes a member of a cognizable racial group or gender and an opposing party requests a Batson hearing, the trial court must hold one.Â  Shuler, 344 S.C. at 615, 545 S.E.2d at 810.\r\nIn State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996) (citing Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765 (1995)), our supreme court set forth the proper procedure for a Batson hearing.\r\n\r\n  After a party objects to a jury strike, the proponent of the strike must offer a facially race-neutral explanation.Â  Â  This explanation is not required to be persuasive or even plausible.Â  Once the proponent states a reason that is race-neutral, the burden is on the party challenging the strike to show the explanation is mere pretext, either by showing similarly situated members of another race were seated on the jury or the reason given for the strike is so fundamentally implausible as to constitute mere pretext despite a lack of disparate treatment.\r\n\r\nRayfield, 369 S.C. at ___, 631 S.E.2d at 247 (citing Adams, 322 S.C. at 123-24, 470 S.E.2d at 371-72; State v. Haigler, 334 S.C. 623, 629-30, 515 S.E.2d 88, 90-91 (1999)).Â  â€œIt is important to note that the â€˜proponent of the peremptory challenges will not have any burden of presenting reasonably specific, legitimate explanations for the strikes.Â  Instead, [he or she] need only present racially neutral explanations.â€™â€Â  State v. Flynn, 368 S.C. 83, 86, 627 S.E.2d 763, 765 (Ct. App. 2006) (quoting Adams, 322 S.C. at 123-24, 470 S.E.2d at 371).Â  Additionally, the burden of persuading the trial court that a Batson violation has occurred remains at all times on the opponent of the strike.Â  State v. Haigler, 334 S.C. 623, 629, 515 S.E.2d 88, 91(1999).\r\n â€œIn deciding whether the opponent of a strike has carried the burden of persuasion, a court must undertake a sensitive inquiry into the circumstantial and direct evidence of intent.â€Â  Id. Â Â â€œThe trial judgeâ€™s findings of purposeful discrimination rest largely on his evaluation of demeanor and credibility.â€Â  Shuler, 344 S.C. at 615, 545 S.E.2d at 810.Â  â€œOften the demeanor of the challenged attorney will be the best and only evidence of discrimination, and â€˜evaluation of the prosecutorâ€™s mind lies peculiarly within a trial judgeâ€™s province.â€™â€ Â Id. at 615-16, 545 S.E.2d at 810 (citing Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 365, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991)).Â Â  The trial courtâ€™s findings in regard to whether there was purposeful discrimination are accorded great deference and such a determination will be set aside on appeal only if clearly erroneous. Haigler, 334 S.C. at 630, 515 S.E.2d at 91.\r\nSimmons, relying on the case of State v. Marble, 311 S.C. 23, 426 S.E.2d 744 (1992), argues the State, as the proponent of the strike, failed to offer a facially race-neutral explanation for the strike, because the State may not meet such a burden by asserting a third party made the decision to strike and then communicated that decision to the solicitor.Â  In Marble, our supreme court, relying on its recent decision in State v. Adams, 307 S.C. 368, 415 S.E.2d 402 (1992), held the State may not meet its burden under Batson by merely asserting that a third person made the decision to strike and communicated this decision to the Solicitor.Â  Both Marble and Adams, however, were interpreted under the previous case law that required the State to give a clear and reasonably specific explanation for its strike in the second step of the Batson procedure.Â  Marble, 311 S.C. at 24, 426 S.E.2d at 745;Â  Adams, 307 S.C. at 370, 415 S.E.2d at 403.Â  As previously noted, our law now mandates that the proponent of the strike no longer has any burden of presenting reasonably specific, legitimate explanations for the strikes, but need only present racially neutral explanations.Â  State v. Flynn, 368 S.C. 83, 86, 627 S.E.2d 763, 765 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Further, both Marble and Adams noted the â€œclear and reasonably specific explanationâ€ offered by the third person must be provided because, without this requirement, there would be no assurance that the third person did not make the decision based on the jurorâ€™s race.Â  Marble, 311 S.C. at 24, 426 S.E.2d at 745; Adams, 307 S.C. at 370, 415 S.E.2d at 403.Â  Here, the explanation offered was not that the solicitor relied on the unexplained and unchallengeable reason of a third party, but that he mistakenly interpreted the signal of an employee in his office who was assisting him in jury selection.Â  Because the third person in this case had, in fact, indicated that the solicitor should not strike the juror, there is assurance that the decision was not made by the third person based on the jurorâ€™s race.Â  In other words, there could be no purposeful discrimination based on the jurorâ€™s race by the third person, as she indicated that this juror should be selected by the solicitor, not struck.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn the case at hand, the solicitor offered as a race-neutral explanation for striking juror number 55 that he had misinterpreted a signal from an employee in his office, representing that the strike of this juror was an inadvertent mistake.Â  The trial court accepted the explanation that it was merely an error on the part of the solicitor.Â  Mindful that the demeanor of the challenged attorney is often the best and only evidence of discrimination,Â  that the evaluation of that attorneyâ€™s mind lies peculiarly within a trial judgeâ€™s province, and that the trial courtâ€™s findings in regard to whether there was purposeful discrimination are accorded such great deference, we hold the trial courtâ€™s determination that the strike was race-neutral was not clearly erroneous.Â  See State v. Casey, 325 S.C. 447, 481 S.E.2d 169 (Ct. App. 1997) (wherein this court held, although the solicitor did not challenge a female venire member with prior jury service yet struck the male juror with prior service, and thus the reason for striking the juror was applied inconsistently, the Stateâ€™s explanation that it was merely an omission and mistake on its part was gender-neutral).Â  Once the State provided a race-neutral reason, it was incumbent upon Simmons, as the opponent of the strike, to show the explanation was mere pretext. Simmons offered no evidence of pretext, and clearly failed to meet his burden.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Simmonsâ€™ convictions areÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Batson v.

Clare, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Shawn L. Reeves, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Robert M. Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Appellant, Corey Moss, was indicted for and convicted of distribution of crack cocaine and distribution of crack cocaine within close proximity of a school.Â  Moss appeals, asserting the trial court erred in ruling the photographic lineup used to identify him was not suggestive.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn May 27, 2003, around 4:15 in the afternoon, Officer Patrick Brown posed as a construction worker while working an undercover operation in the Cotton Street area of the city of Greenville.Â  Officer Brown slowed his vehicle as he drove past three black males and heard someone yell for him to turn around and come back.Â  The man yelling was a black male, wearing a white t-shirt, baggy jeans and white shoes with red writing.Â  When Officer Brown drove back up, the man asked him what he wanted.Â  The officer told him he wanted â€œtwenty of that hard,â€ which is street slang for a single hit of crack cocaine.Â  The man gave Officer Brown a beige rocklike substance in exchange for $20.Â  Looking in his rear view mirror, he observed the man walk into a house at 5 Cotton Street.Â  As the officer drove away, he gave detectives Lawson and White a physical description of the suspect through some surveillance equipment.Â  He described the subject as a black male, about 5â€™6â€™â€™ or 5â€™7â€, around 150 pounds, wearing a white t-shirt, baggy denim jeans, and white tennis shoes with red writing.Â  \r\nDetective Melissa Lawson testified she was in the area of the controlled buy and could hear the transaction take place over audio.Â  She corroborated the conversation between Officer Brown and the other party, as well as the description that was given by Officer Brown.Â  After having Officer Brown confirm the description of the suspect, Detective Lawson contacted Corporal Aiken, the community patrol officer for that area, and gave him the description and the location of the purchase.Â  Corporal Aiken testified, after receiving the description and the area of the transaction, along with the fact that the suspect went to 5 Cotton Street when he left, he immediately told Detective Lawson that Corey Moss fit the description.Â  He stated Moss was the only individual in that area that fit that description, Mossâ€™ aunt lived at 5 Cotton Street, and Moss did hang out there often.Â  After getting a clothing description, Corporal Aiken went to the area and observed Moss walking about fifty yards from where the transaction had occurred.Â  Moss was wearing a white t-shirt, baggy blue jeans, and white tennis shoes with red marking.Â  \r\nAfter Corporal Aiken told her the description fit Corey Moss, Detective Lawson obtained a computer-generated photo array which included Mossâ€™ picture along with five other males with similar characteristics.Â  The pictures were randomly placed in one of six slots.Â  Approximately three to three and a half hours after the purchase, Detective Lawson showed Officer Brown the photo array, telling him the person who sold him crack cocaine may or may not be in the array.Â  She stated Officer Brown immediately picked out Moss.\r\nOfficer Brown testified the individuals in the array were all black males with the same complexion, with similar hair, and about the same age.Â  He stated he was face to face with the seller, they were close to one another, they were on eye level, he made conversation and eye contact with him, and he got a very good look at the personâ€™s face.Â  Further, Officer Brown indicated he was paying close attention to the individual as he was trained to do, so he could give a good description of him. Â Detective Lawson informed him it was a random photo array which may or may not include the subject.Â  Detective Lawson did not indicate or tell Officer Brown which picture he should select.Â  Officer Brown stated he did not have to study the array, and that he recognized Moss â€œright off the bat.â€Â  He testified he was â€œa hundred percent positive thatâ€™s the guy.â€Â  \r\nPrior to trial Moss moved to â€œdismiss the warrant and quash the indictmentâ€ based on an alleged improper identification procedure.Â  The trial court then held a hearing concerning the lineup.Â  After hearing Officer Brownâ€™s testimony and reviewing the photo array, the trial court found â€œnothing at all suggestive in [the] lineupâ€ and denied Mossâ€™ motion to quash, noting because the lineup was not suggestive, it need not review the factors set forth in Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188 (1972). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, appellant argues the trial court erred in finding the photographic lineup was not suggestive. Â He asserts the lineup was unduly suggestive as (1) his photograph was the first one in the six-picture array, (2) he was the only subject directly facing the camera as all the others were tilting their heads to the viewerâ€™s right, and (3) the other subjects were more brightly lit than he.Â  Moss thus contends the lineup and resulting identification should have been suppressed.Â  \r\nâ€œA criminal defendant may be deprived of due process of law by an identification procedure which is unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification.â€Â  State v. Traylor, 360 S.C. 74, 81, 600 S.E.2d 523, 526 (2004).Â  If a suggestive out-of-court identification procedure created a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification, an in-court identification of the accused is inadmissible.Â  Id.Â  â€œThe United States Supreme Court has developed a two-prong inquiry to determine the admissibility of an out-of-court identification.â€Â  Id.Â  (citing Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188 (1972)).Â  First, the trial court must ascertain whether the identification process was unduly suggestive.Â  State v. Moore, 343 S.C. 282, 287, 540 S.E.2d 445, 447 (2000).Â  Next, the trial court must decide whether the out-of-court identification was nevertheless so reliable that no substantial likelihood of misidentification existed.Â  Id. \r\nEven if the identification procedure is unduly suggestive, it need not be excluded so long as, under all the circumstances, the identification was reliable notwithstanding the suggestiveness.Â  Traylor, 360 S.C. at 82, 600 S.E.2d at 527.Â  Rather, the inquiry then focuses on whether, under the totality of the circumstances, there was a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.Â  Id.Â  In evaluating the totality of the circumstances to determine the likelihood of misidentification, the following factors should be considered:Â  (1) the witnessâ€™s opportunity to view the perpetrator at the time of the crime, (2) the witnessâ€™s degree of attention, (3) the accuracy of the witnessâ€™s prior description of the perpetrator, (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and (5) the length of time between the crime and the confrontation. Â State v. Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. 526, 541, 552 S.E.2d 300, 308 (2001).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nWe first note Moss never moved to suppress the identification evidence.Â  Rather, Moss moved to quash the indictment and dismiss the warrant based on the allegedly improper identification procedure. Â Undoubtedly, Moss is challenging on appeal the admissibility of evidence, not the sufficiency of the indictment or any constitutional basis for quashing the indictment.Â  Â Additionally, Moss failed to object to any of the testimony concerning Officer Brownâ€™s identification of him or the admission of the photo array into evidence.Â  It is thus questionable whether appellant has properly preserved this argument for our review. See State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 120-21, 481 S.E.2d 118, 123 (1997)Â  (â€œAn issue may not be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€);Â  State v. Simpson 325 S.C. 37, 42, 479 S.E.2d 57, 60 (1996) (holding, where appellantâ€™s counsel did not make any objections during the testimony, issue of admissibility of evidence was not preserved for appellate review as a ruling in limine is not a final ruling on the admissibility of evidence and unless an objection is made at the time the evidence is offered and a final ruling made, the issue is not preserved for review).Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn spite of trial counselâ€™s motion being one to quash the indictment rather than suppress the evidence, it is clear the trial court held a â€œhearing concerning the lineup,â€ and essentially ruled on the admissibility of the evidence, determining the lineup was not suggestive and the court therefore need not continue evaluation with the Neil v. Biggers factors.Â  Additionally, Officer Brown was the first witness to testify following the courtâ€™s ruling on the lineup.Â  State v. Bowman, 366 S.C. 485, 500-01, 623 S.E.2d 378, 386 (2005) (noting an exception to the rule requiring a contemporaneous objection when evidence is introduced exists where a judge makes an in limine ruling on the admission of evidence on the record immediately prior to the introduction of the evidence in question). \r\nHowever, turning to the merits, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s determination that the photographic lineup was not suggestive.Â  First, the only argument Moss raised to the trial court in arguing the lineup was unduly suggestive was that his picture was the first picture in the photographic array.Â  He never argued to the trial court, as he does on appeal, that he was the only subject directly facing the camera and the other subjects were more brightly lit.Â  See State v. Shuler, 353 S.C. 176, 187, 577 S.E.2d 438, 443 (2003) ( a party cannot raise one basis in support of a motion at trial and another on appeal).Â  Further, the record shows that the photo array was computer generated, with the individual photographs randomly placed into one of six places.Â  We decline to find the mere fact that a defendantâ€™s photograph is the first one in a photo array renders such a lineup impermissibly suggestive, especially as here, where the order of the photos is randomly selected by computer.Â  See White v. State, 187 Ga. App. 301, 302, 370 S.E.2d 50, 51 (1988) (finding photographic lineup was not impermissibly suggestive where appellantâ€™s picture was â€œ in the front and center position in the photo arrayâ€).Â  Additionally, we have viewed the lineup in question and agree with the trial court that there is simply nothing suggestive about the lineup.Â  As in this courtâ€™s decision in State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 230, 522 S.E.2d 845, 852 (Ct. App. 1999), none of the six photographs in the lineup stand out from the others.Â  They are of comparable size and composition, with each subject being similar in appearance, age and physical characteristics.Â  As well, the record shows Detective Lawson did not suggest to Officer Brown which photograph was of the suspect. \r\nFinally, even if the lineup were unduly suggestive, Officer Brownâ€™s identification of Moss was clearly reliable in light of the totality of the circumstances. Â Â First, insofar as the witnessâ€™s opportunity to observe the individual at the time of the crime, Officer Brown testified he was on eye level and face to face with the seller, they were close to one another, he made conversation and eye contact with him, and he got a very good look at the personâ€™s face.Â  Further, Officer Brown stated he was paying close attention to the individual as he was trained to do, so he could give a good description of him. Â Based on Officer Brownâ€™s description, Corporal Aiken shortly thereafter traveled to the area and observed Moss walking about fifty yards from where the transaction had occurred wearing a white t-shirt, baggy blue jeans, and white tennis shoes with red marking, just as Officer Brown had described.Â  Officer Brown testified that he recognized Moss â€œright off the batâ€ and Detective Lawson corroborated Officer Brown immediately picked out Moss.Â  Â Officer Brown further indicated he was â€œa hundred percent positiveâ€ Moss was the individual who had sold him the crack cocaine.Â  Finally, Officer Brown made the identification of Moss only three to three and a half hours after the purchase.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the identification procedure used in this case was not unduly suggestive.Â  We further hold, even if the lineup were suggestive, Officer Brownâ€™s pre-trial identification of Moss was reliable in light of the totality of the circumstances. Â For the foregoing reasons, appellantâ€™s convictions are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-026","title":"State v.

McCants, III, both of Aiken, for Appellant.\r\n        Dennis M. Gmerek, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Willie R. (Father) appeals the termination of his parental rights (TPR) to B.R. (Child).Â  Georgia B. (Mother) was also a defendant in the underlying TPR action but does not join in this appeal. Â Specifically, Father contends the family court erred in granting TPR because the South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Father did not remedy the conditions which caused the removal of Child, and the court improperly allowed evidence regarding Motherâ€™s criminal history and prior involvement with DSS.[1]Â  We affirm.[2]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn February 2003, DSS initiated an investigation surrounding the care of Child.Â  At the time of DSSâ€™s investigation, Father was in prison for driving under suspension and Mother was the sole caregiver for Child; Mother and Father (collectively, Parents) have never been married.Â  DSS determined Child had been abandoned and subjected to physical neglect.Â  DSS removed Child from Motherâ€™s care and placed Child in foster care.Â  Â Â \r\nIn April 2003, DSS and Parents entered into a consent order for removal which placed custody of Child with DSS.Â  In addition, the order approved a treatment plan for Parents.Â  Father was ordered to: (1) successfully complete parenting classes; (2) successfully complete an alcohol/drug treatment program; (3) complete a psychological evaluation; (4) visit his daughter regularly; and (5) provide financial support for his daughter.Â  In addition, Father was instructed to â€œobtain and maintain safe housing and employment for at least six consecutive months.â€Â Â Â  \r\nInitially, Father made steady progress under the treatment plan.Â Â  Specifically, Father completed parenting classes, completed a psychological evaluation, obtained housing, obtained employment, and enrolled in an alcohol/drug treatment program.Â  However, Father only submitted to fifteen out of twenty-seven requested drug screens and tested positive for alcohol on one test.Â Â Â  \r\nIn October 2003, prior to a Judicial Review hearing, DSS and Parents entered into another consent order.Â  The consent order amended Fatherâ€™s treatment plan to require Father to: (1) refrain from the use of alcohol; and (2) â€œdevelop a specific plan for transportation of [Child] to and from medical appointments and therapy sessions.â€Â  The order also provided that all adults living in Fatherâ€™s home must submit to drug screens and background checks.Â Â  \r\nIn February 2004, the family court issued an order granting a six month extension for reunification to allow Parents to work on their treatment plans. Â The order provides â€œ[i]t is clearly not in [Childâ€™s] best interests for SCDSS to initiate termination of parental rights at this time because [Parents] have made some progress towards removing risk of harm to [Child].â€ Â However, the order also notes Father has yet to provide a plan for transportation of Child to her medical appointments, to maintain a stable home, or to secure adequate housing for Child.Â  In addition, the order notes concerns about Fatherâ€™s â€œalcohol environment.â€Â  The order amends the treatment plan to require Father to submit to drug screens three times a week.Â Â Â  Â Â Â \r\nIn June 2004, the family court held a permanency planning hearing.Â  The court found Father â€œhas not provided drug screens as requestedâ€ and â€œhas not been able to provide transportation for [Child] for her therapy appointments.â€Â  Therefore, the Court held Child should not be returned to Father â€œbecause it would cause an unreasonable risk of harm to childâ€™s life, physical health or safety, or mental well-being . . . .â€Â  The court authorized DSS to pursue TPR.Â Â Â  Â \r\nDSS initiated the present TPR action in August 2004, and a TPR hearing was held in September 2005.Â  At trial, DSS presented testimony Father did not appear for all of his drug screenings, Father only attended four of Childâ€™s weekly therapy sessions in over two years, and Child has been in Foster care for about thirty (30) months.Â  In addition, witnesses testified Child suffered from Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and was developmentally delayed but was making tremendous progress at her therapy sessions.Â  Also, over objection, DSS introduced testimony regarding the termination of Motherâ€™s parental rights as to three other children and Motherâ€™s criminal record.Â Â Â  \r\nOn September 23, 2005, the family court issued an order terminating Fatherâ€™s parental rights on the grounds that: (1) Child has lived outside of the home for a period of at least six (6) months; (2) Father failed to remedy the conditions which caused the removal of Child or to rehabilitate; (3) Child has been in foster care for fifteen of the last twenty-two months; and (4) Father failed to supply Child with the appropriate health care and it is unlikely that the home can be made safe within twelve months.Â  In addition, the court found TPR was in Childâ€™s best interest.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn a TPR case, the best interest of the child is the paramount consideration.Â  Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œThe interests of the child shall prevail if the childâ€™s interest and the parental rights conflict.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578 (Supp. 2005).Â  Before parental rights can be forever terminated, the alleged grounds for the termination must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Dept. of Social Services v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 608-09, 582 S.E.2d 419, 423 (2003). Â \r\nOn appeal, this court may review the record and make its own determination whether the grounds for termination are supported by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Dept. of Social Services v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 293, 547 S.E.2d 506, 509 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Despite this broad scope of review, however, we are not required to disregard the findings of the family court, and we note the family court is in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and assign weight to their testimony.Â  Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 297, 513 S.E.2d 358, 367 (1999).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Remedy Conditions Causing Removal\r\nFather argues the family court erred in granting TPR because DSS failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence Father has not remedied the conditions which caused the removal of Child.Â  We affirm on other grounds.Â  \r\nPursuant to section 20-7-1572 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005), the family court may terminate parental rights upon finding at least one of eleven statutory grounds has been met and that termination is in the best interest of the child.Â  The paramount consideration in a TPR case is the best interests of the child or children.Â  S.C. Dept. of Social Services v. Richardson, 298 S.C. 130, 133, 378 S.E.2d 601, 603 (Ct. App. 1989). Â Â Â \r\nThe record indicates statutory grounds for termination exist.Â  Section 20-7-1572(8) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) allows for TPR when â€œthe child has been in foster care under the responsibility of the State for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months.â€Â  On February 26, 2003, Child was taken into protective custody.Â  In April of 2003, Parents signed a consent order to place custody of Child with DSS, and the hearing to terminate Fatherâ€™s parental rights was held in September of 2005.Â  Child had been the responsibility of the state for the entire duration of this process.Â  The family court found that at the time of the termination hearing, Child had been in foster care for thirty-two consecutive months.\r\nThe evidence also demonstrates the termination of Fatherâ€™s parental rights is in the best interests of Child.Â  Childâ€™s foster mother intends to adopt Child and has demonstrated the ability to provide quality care for Child.Â  Moreover, paramount to Childâ€™s successful development is both the Childâ€™s and her parentâ€™s attendance at Childâ€™s weekly therapy sessions.Â  The foster mother has demonstrated a commitment and ability to attend Childâ€™s sessions, whereas Father has only attended four sessions in over two years.Â  Father even testified, â€œI wouldnâ€™t have a job if I visited [Child] every week.â€Â  Finally, the guardian ad litem, Childâ€™s therapist, and DSS case workers all opined the termination of Fatherâ€™s parental rights is in Childâ€™s best interest.Â Â Â  \r\nFather does not appeal from the family courtâ€™s finding concerning the duration of foster care, and we find this to be an independent grounds upon which his parental rights may be terminated.Â  See Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 581, 578 S.E.2d 733, 736 (Ct. App. 2003) (holding that parental rights can be terminated once a child has languished in foster care for fifteen out of the last twenty-two months and the family court finds termination is in the childâ€™s best interest).Â  We find the family courtâ€™s decision to terminate Fatherâ€™s parental rights on the grounds that Child was in foster care under the responsibility of the State for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months was in the best interest of Child.Â  Therefore, we affirm the termination and need not address the merits of Fatherâ€™s remediation argument.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Admission of Evidence \r\nFather next contends the family court erred in allowing testimony regarding the termination of Motherâ€™s parental rights to three other children and Motherâ€™s prior convictions.Â  We disagree. \r\nGenerally, all relevant evidence is admissible.Â  Rule 402, SCRE; Moore v. Moore, 360 S.C. 241, 258, 599 S.E.2d 467, 476 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  However, relevant evidence may be excluded when its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.Â  Rule 403, SCRE; Moore, 360 S.C. at 258, 599 S.E.2d at 476.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe admission of evidence is within the trial courtâ€™s discretion.Â  Gamble v. Intâ€™l Paper Realty Corp. of S.C., 323 S.C. 367, 373, 474 S.E.2d 438, 441 (1996).Â  The courtâ€™s ruling to admit or exclude evidence will only be reversed if it constitutes a clear abuse of discretion.Â  Id.Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is based on an error of law or a factual conclusion without evidentiary support.â€ Vaught v. A.O. Hardee &amp; Sons, Inc.,Â  366 S.C. 475, 480, 623 S.E.2d 373, 375 (2005). \r\nThe family court did not commit an abuse of discretion in allowing testimony about either the termination of Motherâ€™s parental rights to three other children or Motherâ€™s past convictions.Â  Father and Mother were living together at the time of the TPR hearing.Â  Therefore, Motherâ€™s recurring problems with the law and her recurring problems with childcare are certainly relevant in determining whether Childâ€™s best interests are served by remaining with her foster mother or moving in with Father.Â  In addition, Father is not unfairly prejudiced by the introduction of this evidence because the evidence is highly relevant.Â  Therefore, the family court did not err in allowing testimony regarding either Motherâ€™s prior involvement with DSS or Motherâ€™s prior convictions.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the family court did not err in terminating Fatherâ€™s parental rights to Child.Â  The decision of the family court is accordingly \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The underlying action involved the termination of Motherâ€™s parental rights to another of her minor children unrelated to Father.Â  The orders throughout this action involve both minor children.Â  However, because the present appeal only involves Fatherâ€™s rights to Child, any reference to Motherâ€™s other child is omitted. \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-045","title":"State v.

Markley Dennis, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-046\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2007 â€“ Filed January 26, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nDeena Smith McRackan, of Charleston, for Appellant. \r\nAlice F. Paylor and Andrew D. Gowdown, both of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  George Mack appeals his dismissal from his position as a social studies teacher at Brentwood Middle School in the Charleston County School District.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 2004, as a result of unsatisfactory evaluations,[2] the Associate Superintendent for Constituent District No. 4 recommended Mackâ€™s continuing contract not be renewed for the 2004-2005 school year.Â  Mack appealed the recommendation to the District 4 Board of Trustees.Â  The board issued an order on June 4 directing that Mack be offered a contract, but was to demonstrate, â€œduring the first ninety days of the school year, proficiency in the areas required by the Districtâ€™s formal evaluation process.â€Â  The order further stated that â€œduring the first ninety (90) days, the administration at Brentwood Middle School shall make certain that no less than four (4) period long evaluations are conducted of Mr. Mack and shall assess that he is proficient in all areas required by the formal evaluation process.â€Â  \r\nThe 2004-2005 school year began on August 9.Â  Edwin Jones, principal of Brentwood Middle School at the time, observed a portion of one of Mackâ€™s social studies classes on September 30 and October 5.Â  He observed entire class periods on October 20 and December 8.Â  Jean Siewicki, a long-time educator in the District, also observed Mack for two class periods on November 9 and December 14.Â  According to both Jones and Siewicki, Mackâ€™s performance was unsatisfactory.Â  In their opinions Mack failed to communicate high expectations for his students, did not engage students in critical thinking, did not sequence the content of his material in a logical fashion, lacked long and short-term planning skills, and exhibited poor classroom management, particularly in the area of student discipline.Â  Based upon these unsatisfactory evaluations, Mack was terminated.Â  He appealed his termination to members of the District 4 Board who concluded â€œthe administration ha[d] presented substantial evidence that Mr. Mack has failed to satisfactorily perform his duties and responsibilities as a teacher.â€Â  The Charleston County School District Board and the circuit court agreed and upheld the decision to terminate Mack.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n The standard applicable to judicial review of a school board decision is limited to a determination of whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence.Â  Laws v. Richland County Sch. Dist. No. 1, 270 S.C. 492, 495, 243 S.E.2d 192, 193 (1978).Â  Substantial evidence is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the board reached or must have reached in order to justify its action.Â  Id. at 495-96, 243 S.E.2d at 193.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMack raises two issues on appeal.Â  First, he argues that the evaluation requirements in the June 4 order did not comply with state laws and regulations or with school district policy so that the termination of his employment based on the resulting assessments constitutes an error of law.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s order does not address any procedural violations, and there is no Rule 59(e) motion in the record seeking a ruling on that issue.Â  It appears this precise issue is raised for the first time on appeal to this court.Â  Consequently, it is not preserved for our review.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).\r\n\r\n Secondly, assuming the evaluation process outlined in the June 4 order was valid, Mack contends that process was not followed, and the resulting assessments therefore cannot serve as the basis for his termination.Â  The preservation of this argument is somewhat suspect as well.Â  Nevertheless even on the merits, Mackâ€™s argument is unpersuasive.Â  Mack argues that the evaluations were not performed within the proscribed ninety-day period and did not include four period-long evaluations.Â  According to the record before us, it appears that November 7 marked the end of the ninety-day period in which Mack was to be evaluated.Â  If so, three of the observations fell within the ninety-day period, and three of the observations, November 9, December 8, and December 14, were conducted beyond this period.Â  The evaluators testified that four of the six observations were for a full class period.Â  There is some evidence that Ms. Siewickiâ€™s observations were not for a full ninety-minute class period.Â  However, Ms. Siewicki explained she observed the entire social studies portion of one class until Mack began discussing a different subject, nutrition.Â  She also testified that she conducted her other evaluation from the beginning of class until the bell rang, which she assumed signaled the end of the period. Â Based on the testimony, we conclude that District 4 substantially complied with the mandates of the June 4 order.Â  Furthermore, there is no evidence that Mack was denied due process by the lack of strict adherence to the order.Â  In fact, Mack concedes that even if the June 4 order had been followed with absolute precision there may well have been substantial evidence to support the decision to terminate his employment.Â  The evaluations and testimony of Jones and Siewicki provide substantial evidence to support Mackâ€™s termination.Â \r\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the decision of the circuit court is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]  These evaluations were conducted under the Assisting, Developing, and Evaluating Professional Teaching evaluation process.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-047","title":"Pearson v.
