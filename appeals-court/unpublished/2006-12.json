McLaren and C. Dixon Lee, III, both of Columbia, for Appellant.Â  \r\nThomas F. McDow, of Rock Hill, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Suzette Sladek, Wife, appeals the family courtâ€™s denial of her request for alimony, attorneyâ€™s fees, and costs.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nGerard Sladek, age 57, and Wife, age 44, were married for almost eleven years. Â One child, a daughter, was born of the marriage, and Wife had one son from a previous marriage. Â The parties spent much of the marriage living in separate residences. Â Wife had received substantial insurance proceeds from the death of her previous husband and had used those funds to build a home. Â Wife and children lived in the house while Husband occupied a garage apartment adjacent to the main house.Â  Husband was retired from the Internal Revenue Service and received a monthly retirement benefit of $3,727. Â Additionally, Husband was employed by the North Carolina Department of Revenue earning $4,000 per month. Â Wife, a college graduate, worked part-time as a preschool program director earning $583 per month.Â  Wife also received $1,267 per month in dividends on non-marital investments.Â  \r\nAt some point in the summer of 2002, while on vacation, Husband and Wifeâ€™s son were involved in an altercation.Â  Wife filed for divorce on July 30, 2002.Â  The family court denied Wifeâ€™s request for alimony, stating she was capable of procuring higher paying, full-time employment.Â  The family court also denied Wifeâ€™s request for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs. Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe decision to grant or deny alimony rests within the discretion of the family court judge.Â  Clardy v. Clardy, 266 S.C. 270, 273, 222 S.E.2d 771, 772 (1976).Â  The judgeâ€™s discretion, when exercised in light of the facts of each particular case, will not be disturbed on appeal absent abuse thereof.Â  Long v. Long, 247 S.C. 250, 252, 146 S.E.2d 873, 875 (1966).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the judge is controlled by some error law or where the order, based upon findings of fact, is without evidentiary support.Â  Stewart v. Floyd, 274 S.C. 437, 440, 265 S.E.2d 254, 255 (1980).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWife asserts the family court erred in denying her alimony and attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  We disagree.Â  On the issue of alimony, she focuses exclusively on and claims error in the following three findings of fact made by the family court:Â  (1) There was no reason Wife could not earn entry-level college graduate income; (2) Husbandâ€™s expenses exceed his income; and (3) Wife did not prove the breakup of the marriage was Husbandâ€™s fault.Â  We shall address those issues seriatim.Â  \r\nSince the parties married, Wife was a stay-at-home mother and later, part-time preschool director. Â Her lack of recent college level employment may make it more difficult to obtain a higher paying position.Â  However, Wife does possess a college degree, and her children are older, attending public school, and arguably require less of her time.Â  Additionally, Wife testified she planned to pursue her teaching certification so that she would â€œhave the same hours as [her] children.â€ Â These additional credentials would enhance her employability.Â  â€œThe burden is upon the appellant to convince this Court that the trial judge erred in his findings of fact.â€Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981).Â  Wifeâ€™s assertions that it will be difficult to find suitable employment are not enough to meet this burden.Â  Because there is evidentiary support in the record for the courtâ€™s ruling, we cannot conclude the family courtâ€™s finding was error.\r\nWife also contends the court erred in concluding Husbandâ€™s expenses exceeded his income.Â  Again, we turn to the record to see if this finding is supported by some evidence.Â  Husbandâ€™s financial declaration states that his net monthly income is $5,001.74, and his monthly expenses are $9,005.Â  According to the declaration, Husband pays $2,000 per month to an adult emancipated daughter. Â He further claims to pay $158 per month in real property taxes[2] and $90 per month in real property insurance, $500 in dental bills and $1,400 in child or spousal support. Â Wife disputes all of these expenses, and Husbandâ€™s own testimony calls the validity of these expenses as monthly obligations into question.[3] Â However, the family court is in the better position to judge the credibility of witnesses and assign weight to their testimony.Â  Cherry at 525, 280 S.E.2d at 541.Â  Moreover, even if we completely remove the items Wife questions, Husbandâ€™s expenses total almost $5,000 per month, primarily due to substantial credit card debt.Â  Based on the evidence in the record, we cannot conclude the family court abused its discretion in finding Husbandâ€™s expenses exceed his income.\r\nFinally, Wife argues the family court erred in determining Husband and Wife were equally responsible for the breakup of the marriage.Â  Wife testified that during the marriage Husband had disfavored her son and was often angry and rough with him. Â In particular, there was an allegedly violent altercation between Husband and Wifeâ€™s son during a family trip to Charleston. Â Wife claims this incident was the â€œstraw that broke the camelâ€™s back.â€Â  Wife further testified Husband had moved out of the bedroom of his own accord because they had a new baby, and eventually moved into the garage apartment because of the childrenâ€™s noise and their early bedtime.Â  Husband testified he initially moved out because Wife had trouble sleeping well with another person in the bed.Â  He made the more permanent move to the garage apartment because Wife put stress on him at the end of the workday, and she wanted quiet for herself and the children to sleep when Husband desired to stay up later.Â  Wife admits the issue of fault raises the classic he said/she said situation.Â  As previously noted, it is for the family court to determine the credibility of the witnesses and make factual determinations based on their testimony.Â  Id.Â  The family court apparently gave more credence to Husbandâ€™s version of events in Charleston, and in addition found that the marriage had essentially been dysfunctional from the beginning with Husband and Wife having separate residences.Â  Based on the foregoing, we cannot conclude the courtâ€™s determination that the parties were equally at fault in disrupting the marriage was error. Â \r\nWith respect to attorneyâ€™s fees, the thrust of Wifeâ€™s argument is that because she should prevail on the issue of alimony, she should, as a matter of course, be entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  As previously discussed, we do not find error in the family courtâ€™s rulings and therefore do not alter the outcome of the case.Â  Wife also asserts that the family court did not consider the Glasscock factors in denying her request.Â  See Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403 S.E.2d 313 (1991).Â  However, the Glasscock factors are only relevant in determining the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees to be awarded.Â  Wife only appeals the fact that she was not awarded attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  â€œIn determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the court should consider each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fee; the beneficial results obtained by the attorney; the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions; and the effect of the attorneyâ€™s fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.â€Â \r\nGriffith v. Griffith, 332 S.C. 630, 645, 506 S.E.2d 526, 534 (Ct. App. 1998) (emphasis in original).Â  Here the record shows the family court considered these factors, and we can ascertain no abuse of discretion in its ruling. Â \r\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is Â \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â Wifeâ€™s brief states that Husband claimed to pay $715 per month for real property taxes on the residence.Â  However, Husbandâ€™s financial declaration lists an obligation of $158 per month for real property taxes.Â  We use the obligation shown on Husbandâ€™s declaration in our analysis.Â  \r\n[3]Â Husband paid his adult daughter a lump sum of $27,000 at the beginning of 2003 as part of a contempt action and apparently divided that sum into monthly payments over the year for purposes of his financial declaration.Â  Husband testified he paid $500 in January, February, and March of 2003 for dental expenses, and that it would take more work to â€œget [his] mouth straightened out.â€Â  The taxes and insurance claimed related to Wifeâ€™s non-marital home, which she would retain after the divorce.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-390","title":"State v.

Savitz III, of Columbia, for Appellant\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Senior Assistant Attorney General William Edgar Salter, III, of Columbia; John Gregory Hembree, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Scottie Robinson appeals his murder conviction.Â  He argues the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury on self-defense.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn September 30, 2001, Aaron Robinson was playing basketball with several other men, including Anthony Bradley, at the Smith Jones Recreation Center (the Center) in Conway, South Carolina.Â  During the basketball game, Robinson and Bradley argued and engaged in a scuffle wherein Bradley grabbed Robinson by the throat and shoved him.Â  After the two men were separated, Robinson went to his car and drove home.Â  \r\nAt some point after the incident, Scottie Robinson (Appellant), Aaron Robinsonâ€™s older brother, became aware that an incident had occurred between his brother and another man at the Center.[2]Â  Appellant picked up his cousin Theartis Robinson and drove to the Center.Â  Upon arriving at the Center, Appellant retrieved a handgun from the glove compartment of his vehicle, and he and his cousin approached the men on the basketball court.[3]Â  Bradley attempted to grab the gun from Appellant, and during the struggle, Appellant fatally shot Bradley in the chest.Â  Immediately following the shooting, Appellant walked back to his car and drove home.Â Â Â  \r\nAn Horry County grand jury indicted Appellant for murder.Â  At trial, the jury convicted Appellant on all charges, and the trial court sentenced him to thirty years imprisonment.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn appellate court will not reverse the trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding\r\njury charges absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law or, when grounded in factual conclusions, is without evidentiary support.â€Â  Id.Â  If any evidence exists to support a\r\njury charge, the trial judge should grant the requested charge.Â  State v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 262, 513 S.E.2d 104, 108 (1999).Â  A refusal to grant a requested\r\njury charge which states a sound principle of law applicable to the case at hand is an error of law.Â  Clark, 339 S.C. at 390, 529 S.E.2d at 539.Â Â  A self-defense jury charge is required only when the evidence presented at trial supports such a charge.Â  State v. Goodson, 312 S.C. 278, 280, 440 S.E.2d 370, 372 (1994).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellant contends the trial court erred in denying his request to charge the jury on self-defense.Â  We disagree.\r\nA defendant is entitled to a self-defense charge only when the following four elements can be established: (1) the defendant was without fault in bringing\r\non the difficulty; (2) the defendant believed he was in imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury; (3) the defendant had no means of avoiding the danger and was thereby forced to act as he did; and (4) that a reasonably prudent person of ordinary firmness and courage in a similar situation would have entertained the same belief about the danger.Â \r\nJackson v. State, 355 S.C. 568, 570-71, 586 S.E.2d 562, 563 (2003).\r\nIn this matter, the record fails to establish the necessary elements for a charge of self-defense.Â  There is no evidence in the record to support the notion that Appellant was without fault in bringing about the difficulty.Â  Appellant testified that his intentions in driving to the Center were to confront Bradley and tell him to leave his brother alone.Â  It is undisputed that Appellant, while holding a gun, approached Bradley on the basketball court.Â  In fact, Appellant testified that Bradley specifically instructed him not to come onto the court with the gun.Â  The fact that a struggle over the gun ensued does not allow Appellant to claim self-defense.Â  â€œ[O]ne who provokes or initiates an assault cannot escape criminal\r\nliability by invoking self-defense.â€Â  State v. Slater, 360 S.C. 487, 491, 602 S.E.2d 90, 92-93 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nFurther, even if appellant reasonably believed he was in imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury,[4] he certainly had means to avoid the danger.Â  Appellant testified that upon his arriving at the Center, Bradley immediately began yelling â€œviolent wordsâ€ at him.Â  Yet, despite his ability to simply return to his vehicle and leave, Appellant retrieved his gun and approached Bradley on the basketball court.Â  When asked why he did not simply leave the Center, Appellant testified â€œI donâ€™t know how to answer that.â€Â Â  \r\nNeither the first nor the third prongs of self-defense have raised questions of fact for the jury.Â  As a matter of law, these required elements have not been established.Â  â€œBecause the record demonstrates as a matter of law the absence of at least one element of self-defense, the trial judge did not err in refusing to charge self-defense.â€Â  State v. Santiago, 370 S.C. 153, ___, 634 S.E.2d 23, 28Â  (Ct. App. 2006).\r\n\r\n    CONCLUSION\r\nWe find no error by the trial court in refusing to charge the jury on self-defense.Â  Based on the foregoing, Appellantâ€™s conviction is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Both Appellant and Aaron Robinson testified that they did not speak with each other following the incident at the recreation center.Â  Therefore, neither the manner in which Appellant came to learn of the events, nor the exact details of which he was made aware are entirely clear.Â  It appears Appellant overheard some neighbors discussing the incident. \r\n[3] Although through conflicting accounts, all parties agree that through a verbal exchange, Appellant became aware that Bradley was the individual who had tussled with his brother.Â  Appellant testified that Bradley immediately began screaming at him, and other witnesses testified that Appellant asked who â€œwas messing with his brother,â€ and Bradley responded â€œit was me.â€Â  \r\n[4] Bradley had a reputation in the community for being a â€œtough guyâ€ and had participated in several professional boxing matches.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-391","title":"State v.

Peace, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Corey McKenzie Shelton appeals his convictions for murder and possession of a firearm during commission of a violent crime, for which he received concurrent sentences of life imprisonment and five years, respectively. Â Shelton argues the trial judge erred by refusing to direct a verdict acquitting him of the charges because the State failed to introduce any evidence he committed the crimes.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThis case involves the drive-by shooting of fourteen-year-old Phillip Johnson, Jr. on August 4, 2001.Â  Corey Shelton, Derek Brown, and Ricky Latimore were indicted with murder and possession of a firearm or a knife during commission of a violent crime in connection with this incident.[2]Â  \r\nOn the night of the shooting, Johnson, his cousin Xavier Smith, and a number of friends attended a high school football game.Â  After leaving the football game, the boys went to a friendâ€™s house on Pleasant View Drive, and â€œhung outâ€ with ten to twelve boys in the front yard.Â  Smith testified that around 11:00 to 11:30 p.m., a large, dark-colored car, which had been parked nearby when the boys arrived, came down the road with two guns firing out the windows.Â  Someone in the group fired back at the car as it drove away.Â  Johnson was shot in the drive-by. \r\nJohnson died from his gunshot wound on the way to the hospital.Â  Bullet fragments removed from his body were sent to SLED for testing.Â  At the scene, officers found fifteen 7.62mm casings, seven .45 casings, as well as a 9mm casing.Â  Bullets that penetrated a nearby residence were also sent to SLED for testing.Â  \r\nSmith could not identify the people in the assailantâ€™s car.Â  Directly after the drive-by, he gave the police the names of Terrence Bishop, Darrell Brown, and â€œK,â€ but testified that those were just the names of some boys with whom he had gotten into an argument at the football game.Â  Smith also told the police at the scene that the car was green, while at trial he only remembered that it was dark.Â  \r\nOn August 25, 2001, Darryl Mosely was brought to the police station where he provided a statement against the co-defendants, who are his cousins.Â  At trial, Mosely retracted his statement, claiming that he never read the statement, that he was lying because the officers threatened his life, and that they had fed him the details and information in his statement.Â  He did, however, admit on cross-examination that the statement accurately reflected what he told the officer.Â  He also admitted at trial that he had seen the three defendants together before they left the â€œLionâ€™s Den,â€ but that he did not see any of them with a gun.Â  \r\nMoselyâ€™s original statement to police contained more incriminating information.Â  He said that on the night of the incident, he saw Shelton with an SKS rifle and a banana clip strapped around his neck.[3]Â  He stated that the three defendants then got into a green four-door Pontiac Catalina and drove off.Â  \r\nOn August 26, 2001, defendant Corey Shelton told Captain Williams where he could locate an AK-47.Â  Officers went to the place he described and found an AK-47, some banana clips for the AK-47, and a .32 caliber revolver.Â  \r\nDefendant Derrick Brown made a statement to Chief Deputy Eddie Smith.Â  In the statement, Brown said that at about 11:00 to 11:30 p.m., on the night of the shooting, he was driving down Pleasant View Drive in his Green Pontiac Catalina and drinking beer when he heard a shot.Â  He said that he thought someone was shooting at him, so he pulled out his .45 caliber pistol and fired it out the window as he drove away.Â  He stated he then hid the gun.Â  Brown claimed he did not know who he was shooting at and did not know Phillip Johnson.Â  After he had made this statement, Brown personally led police to where he hid the .45 caliber pistol.Â  \r\nThe SLED examiner found that the bullet fragment taken from Johnson was too damaged to conclusively identify whether it came from Sheltonâ€™s AK-47, but that its characteristics indicated it could have been fired from his weapon.Â  The bullet that killed Johnson was not from a .45 pistol.Â  The fifteen 7.62mm casings found at the scene were the type that could have been fired from Sheltonâ€™s AK-47.Â  All seven of the .45 casings found at the scene were matched to Brownâ€™s .45 caliber pistol.Â  The SLED examiner also conclusively matched the bullet that had penetrated a nearby house to Brownâ€™s pistol.Â  Revolvers like Sheltonâ€™s .32 caliber do not automatically eject casings, which explains why none were found at the scene, but the SLED examiner did conclusively match Sheltonâ€™s revolver to the other bullet that had penetrated a nearby house.Â  \r\nAt the end of the Stateâ€™s case and again at the conclusion of the trial, Shelton moved for a directed verdict, arguing the State failed to introduce any evidence he murdered Johnson.Â  The motions were denied, and the jury convicted Shelton of both murder and possession of a firearm during commission of a violent crime.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nShelton challenges the trial judgeâ€™s denial of his motion for a directed verdict.Â  Specifically, he argues that there was not substantial circumstantial evidence that Shelton committed, or aided and abetted the commission of, the murder of Philip Johnson.Â  This argument has no merit.\r\nWhen reviewing the denial of a directed verdict, a South Carolina appellate court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the State to determine if there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused.Â  State v. Curtis, 356 S.C. 622, 633-34, 591 S.E.2d 600, 605 (2004); State v. Zeigler, 364 S.C. 94, 101-2, 610 S.E.2d 859, 863 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  If there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused, or from which his guilt can be fairly and logically deduced, then the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  State v. Martin, 340 S.C. 597, 602, 533 S.E.2d 572, 574 (2000); State v. Cooper, 334 S.C. 540, 551-52, 514 S.E.2d 584, 590 (1999).Â  Evidence that merely raises a suspicion the accused is guilty is not sufficient to survive a directed verdict motion.Â  State v. Buckmon, 347 S.C. 316, 321, 555 S.E.2d 402, 404 (2001); State v. Muhammed, 338 S.C. 22, 26, 524 S.E.2d 637, 639 (Ct. App. 1999).Â Â  \r\nShelton contends that â€œ[a]t best, the State proved that, shortly before Johnson was killed, Shelton was armed with a rifle that could have fired the fatal shot.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nThe State introduced substantial circumstantial evidence linking Shelton to Johnsonâ€™s murder. Â The State proved Shelton had an AK-47 with banana clips that fired ammunition consistent with that which killed Johnson, and ejected the same casings as those found in the vicinity of Johnsonâ€™s murder.Â  The State conclusively matched Sheltonâ€™s .32 caliber revolver to a bullet that penetrated a nearby house.Â  The State also introduced a statement from Darryl Mosely that described Shelton on the night of the incident getting into the car, carrying what Mosely described as an SKS rifle with banana clips, along with Brown, who admitted driving the car and firing a pistol at the crime scene.Â  This evidence is sufficient to support submission to the jury.Â  See State v. Weston, 367 S.C 279, 625 S.E.2d 641 (2006)(finding circumstantial evidence sufficient to support conviction for murder where victimâ€™s body was never found but she had mysteriously disappeared,Â  and where physical evidence at the residence defendant and victim shared, alongside defendantâ€™s suspicious behavior indicated a murder might have taken place); State v.

Shupe, Office of the Attorney General, of Columbia, Warren Blair Giese, Fifth Circuit Solicitor's Office, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Roy Vance McElveen plead guilty to conspiracy to commit armed robbery and armed robbery.Â  The circuit court sentenced McElveen to five years on the conspiracy charge and twenty years on the armed robbery charge, both sentences to run concurrently.Â  On appeal McElveen argues his plea was not voluntarily and knowingly given, because he was not informed of the maximum or mandatory penalty.Â  We affirm. Â \r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 7, 2004, McElveen and another person attempted to rob Lucille Ogunji.Â  One month later, a Richland County Grand Jury indicted McElveen on one count of conspiracy to commit armed robbery and one count of armed robbery.Â  On May 31, 2005, McElveen, with assistance of counsel, plead guilty to both charges.Â  \r\nPrior to accepting the guilty plea, the circuit court advised McElveen of his constitutional trial rights, including a right to a jury trial, right to counsel, and right to confront and challenge witnesses.Â  However, the circuit court failed to notify McElveen of the maximum or mandatory penalty for each offense.Â  \r\nMcElveen now contends his plea was invalid because the circuit court failed to advise him about possible sentences.Â  The State argues McElveen did not challenge the validity of his guilty plea before the circuit court; therefore, the issue is not preserved for appeal. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe State argues the issue of the McElveenâ€™s plea is not preserved for appeal.Â  We agree.\r\nA â€œfailure to object at trial to the involuntary nature of a guilty plea precludes consideration of the issue on appeal.â€Â  State v. McKinney, 278 S.C. 107, 108, 292 S.E.2d 598, 599 (1982); see, e.g., State v. Bradley, 263 S.C. 223, 226, 209 S.E.2d 435, 436 (1974) (failure to assert\r\nat trial a guilty plea was involuntarily entered precludes consideration of such a claim on appeal); In re Arisha K.S., 331 S.C. 288, 293, 501 S.E.2d 128, 131 (Ct.

James (Husband) to make his future support payments by wage withholding.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife separated after twenty-five years of marriage. Although Wife sought a divorce on the grounds of adultery, the family court found she had not proven Husband committed adultery and granted a divorce on other grounds.Â  At the time of the divorce, which occurred in 2001, Wife had two jobs: during the day, she worked as a greeter at Wal-Mart, and at night, she worked as a janitor.Â  Husband, who retired from a full career in the military, worked full-time during his retirement as a team leader at Dentyns Shipyards. \r\nHusbandâ€™s financial declaration reflected a monthly income of only $2,401, although the family court recognized that he made approximately $2,580 per month in 1998, $2,740 per month in 1999, and averaged over $3,700 per month for the first five months of 2000.Â  In contrast, Wifeâ€™s gross monthly income was merely $1,618. The family court ordered Husband to pay Wife alimony in the amount of $750, noting that once the marital home sold, Husband would be relieved of his obligation to pay the $1,100 monthly mortgage.Â  Wife was also awarded 42.5 percent of Husbandâ€™s military retirement benefits.Â  \r\nFour years after alimony was awarded, Husband brought this action seeking a reduction or termination in alimony because his monthly income had been reduced to $2,873.Â  Wife answered the complaint, and by way of counterclaim, requested Husbandâ€™s future alimony payments be paid through wage withholding.Â  A hearing was held on the matter, at which Husband testified that he no longer received an hourly wage and overtime at Dentyns, but instead, received a flat monthly salary of $2,873.[1] Â Husband also argued that Wifeâ€™s monthly income had increased to $2,082.Â  Wife admitted that her income had increased because she was now able to work full-time at Wal-Mart.Â  However, she pointed out that Husbandâ€™s expenses had significantly decreased since the last hearing because he had remarried and was living rent-free in a home owned by his new wife. \r\nThe family court found Husband met his burden of proving a substantial change in circumstances to warrant a reduction in alimony. Accordingly, the court reduced Husbandâ€™s obligation to $300 per month and denied Wifeâ€™s request for wage withholding.Â  Wife filed a Rule 59(e) motion, and Husband filed a return in which he asked for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs for defending the motion for reconsideration.Â  The family court denied Wifeâ€™s motion for reconsideration and ordered her to pay Husband $750 for attorneyâ€™s fees he incurred defending the motion.Â  This appeal followed.[2]\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œQuestions concerning alimony rest with the sound discretion of the trial court, whose conclusions will not be disturbed absent a showing of abuse of discretion.â€Â  Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, 485, 477 S.E.2d 727, 729 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the court is controlled by some error of law or where the order, based upon findings of fact, is without evidentiary support.â€Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWife argues the family court erred in reducing her alimony from $750 per month to $300 per month.Â  We agree.\r\nIt is well-settled that ex-spouses may seek modification of alimony based on an unanticipated substantial or material change of either spouseâ€™s circumstances.Â \r\nThornton v. Thornton, 328 S.C. 96, 492 S.E.2d 86 (1997); Kelley, 324 S.C. at 485-86, 477 S.E.2d at 729; Calvert v. Calvert, 287 S.C. 130, 138, 336 S.E.2d 884, 888 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  The burden is on the party seeking modification to show by a preponderance of evidence that a material change has occurred.Â  Kelley, 324 S.C. at 486, 477 S.E.2d at 729.Â  â€œThe mere fact that a supporting spouseâ€™s salary or income has been reduced does not of itself require a reduction of . . . alimony[.]â€Â  Calvert, 287 S.C. at 138, 336 S.E.2d at 888-89.Â  â€œA modification [in alimony] is not warranted absent a strong showing by [the paying spouse] that he is no longer in a condition to support his wife . . . as the family court prescribed.â€Â  Id. at 139, 336 S.E.2d at 889.\r\nInitially, we note that the extent to which Husbandâ€™s monthly income declined is difficult to decipher.Â  In the original order setting alimony at $750, the family court never specified the amount of monthly income it was using to determine Husbandâ€™s obligation.Â  Rather, it noted the amount of monthly income Husband declared, $2,400, was lower than the monthly income he had received since 1998.Â  Instead of specifically imputing a monthly income to Husband, the family court acknowledged Husbandâ€™s various incomes since 1998 and, perhaps more importantly, noted that once the marital residence was sold, â€œHusband will be relieved of the obligation of making the mortgage payments for that residence which are now approximately $1,100 per month.â€Â  Additionally, the court explained Husband would no longer have to pay the partiesâ€™ $574 per month consumer credit counseling debt.Â  Based on Husbandâ€™s superior, albeit unspecified, monthly income and the reduction in his expenses, the family court found Husband had the ability to pay Wife $750 per month in alimony.Â  Â Â  \r\nWith no specific finding of Husbandâ€™s monthly income in the initial order establishing alimony, Husband cannot contradict his previous financial declaration and argue his former income, which he listed as $2,400 per month, was actually $3,700 per month.Â  See Penny v. Green, 357 S.C. 583, 591, 594 S.E.2d 171, 175 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œA party cannot misrepresent income and expenses on a financial declaration . . . and then refute the accuracy of that document in a subsequent modification action.â€).\r\nEven if we assume the $750 in alimony was based on a monthly income of $3,700, Husband failed to show a material change in circumstances. Â At the modification hearing, Husbandâ€™s gross monthly income still exceeded Wifeâ€™s, and just as the family court had anticipated, Husband shed $1,674 in monthly obligations once the marital residence sold.Â  Despite the purported decline in wages of approximately $800 per month, Husbandâ€™s pension income increased by approximately $100 per month.Â  He has since remarried, and not only enjoys the benefit of his present wifeâ€™s income for sharing household bills, but is also allowed to live rent-free in his present wifeâ€™s home.Â  Thus, even with a $750 per month alimony payment, Husbandâ€™s net income exceeds his expenses by nearly $200. Husband therefore failed to make a strong showing he was no longer in a position to support Wife pursuant to the original order.Â  See Calvert, 287 S.C. at 138, 336 S.E.2d at 889.[3]Â  \r\nAccordingly, we find the family erred in reducing Husbandâ€™s alimony.Â  Instead, we order Husband to continue paying $750 per month to Wife as was originally ordered.Â  Because Wife was entitled to alimony during the pendency of this appeal, we remand this case back to the family court to determine the amount of past alimony due to Wife.\r\nWife next argues the family court erred in failing to order Husbandâ€™s wages be withheld to meet his monthly alimony obligation.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nIn its order reducing alimony, the family court recognized that Husband had sometimes been late in paying Wife her alimony.Â  The family court believed the late payments reflected the difficulty Husband had in meeting his alimony obligation, and in light of its reduction in Husbandâ€™s alimony, the family court declined to impose wage withholding.Â  Because of our reversal of the family courtâ€™s reduction in alimony and Husbandâ€™s history of tardy alimony payments, we find wage withholding appropriate.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the family court erred in reducing Husbandâ€™s alimony, and we reinstate his obligation to pay Wife $750 per month.Â  In order to determine the amount of past alimony due to Wife, we remand the issue to the family court.Â  Because we reverse the reduction in alimony and in light of Husbandâ€™s history of making late alimony payments to Wife, we order Husbandâ€™s wages be withheld to meet his monthly alimony obligation.Â  Accordingly, the order of the family court is\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and STILWELL and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Although never mentioned in his complaint, Husband also testified that he had suffered from a partial stroke and was beginning to receive medical bills from his hospital stay.Â  However, Husband also admitted he had returned to work at full capacity, and the family court judge did not mention Husbandâ€™s medical bills as a reason he was reducing alimony.Â  \r\n[2] Wife does not appeal from the award of attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\n[3] We also note that although Husband claims he cannot afford to pay Wife $750 per month, his financial declaration reflects that he pays over $800 per month in car expenses and $50 per month on a loan for his adult daughter.Â  â€œUnwarranted debts, without more, are insufficient to establish changed circumstances or justify [a modification] in alimony.â€Â  Baker v. Baker, 286 S.C. 200, 203, 332 S.E.2d 550, 552 (Ct.

Dowd, III (Husband), to zero based upon a provision in the Final Order and Decree of Divorce.Â  Additionally, Wife maintains the court erred in requiring her to reimburse Husband for alimony paid after the filing of the complaint and pay part of Husbandâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe parties divorced in 1991.Â  The Final Order and Decree of Divorce, dated April 8, 1991, approved and adopted a settlement agreement by the parties.Â  The order provided:Â  \r\n\r\nAfter the marital home is sold, the Husband shall pay seven hundred ($700.00) [d]ollars per month to the Wife as permanent and periodic alimony. . . . If the Wife cohabitates with a man on a continuous and romantic basis, the alimony payment will be reduced to zero (0)[;] however[,] the obligation to pay alimony will not be terminated.Â  \r\n\r\nThe parties had three daughters during the marriage.Â  Wife was originally granted custody of the children.Â  However, the two older daughters were later allowed to move in with Husband.\r\nIn 1990 or 1991 Wife met Skip Joyner at a Parents Without Partners meeting.Â  Wife frequently visited Joynerâ€™s residence and would periodically take the children there for the weekend.Â  Joyner was involved in many activities with the children, including Christmas, vacations, and graduations.Â  In 1992, Joyner adopted a baby girl.Â  Joynerâ€™s daughter was also involved in many of the activities with Wife and her daughters.Â  Wife acted as a mother in helping to raise Joynerâ€™s child.Â  \r\nIn 1995, Husband brought an action seeking custody of the partiesâ€™ youngest daughter.Â  A consent order was issued by the court.Â  The parties agreed that Wife would pay no child support and, as a result, the alimony paid by Husband was reduced to $550.00 per month. Â The consent order contained a provision which stated:Â  â€œAll provisions of the Decree of Divorce dated 4-8-91 shall remain in full force and effect except as are expressly modified herein.â€Â  \r\nDuring the mid 1990â€™s, Wife and Joyner were romantically involved, and, according to Wife, were engaged to be married.Â  Although the engagement ended, the two remained friends.Â  Wife continued to act as a mother figure to Joynerâ€™s child.Â  She was listed as a contact person on the childâ€™s school records and was even listed as the childâ€™s mother on some records.\r\nWife moved in with Joyner for a period of time in 1999 when she became ill with Reactive Airway Disease.Â  In August of 2000, Husband wrote a letter to Wife seeking to end alimony due to her living with Joyner.Â  Wife subsequently moved in with a roommate and again kept a separate apartment.Â  However, Wife maintained she did not recall receiving a letter from Husband.Â  Â Â \r\nIn 2003, Joyner had a stroke and required care. Â He had a daytime caregiver, and Wife moved in with Joyner in January 2004 to provide his nighttime care.Â  While she received no pay from Joyner for her services as caregiver, she did not have to pay rent to stay at his residence.\r\nHusband brought the instant action on May 27, 2004.Â  The complaint alleged that Wife and Joyner began a relationship in 1990 and â€œbegan living together in approximately 1997.â€ Â In addition, the action asked for reimbursement of attorneyâ€™s fees and all costs.Â  Wife filed an answer and counterclaim, denying the relationship and seeking an increase in alimony.\r\nAt the hearing, the partiesâ€™ daughters testified that they spent time at Joynerâ€™s house when they lived with Wife.Â  They testified the easiest way to get in touch with their mother was to call Joynerâ€™s house and leave a message or they would find her already there at all times of day and night.Â  \r\nHusband testified he believed Wife and Joyner lived together from 1997 through at least 2000, when he wrote her the letter seeking to end alimony.Â  Additionally, he testified he did not seek court intervention to reduce the alimony until the partiesâ€™ youngest daughter had graduated college.Â  Finally, he admitted he did not know where Wife was living at the time of the hearing, only that she admitted residing with Joyner for the previous six months.Â  \r\nWife admitted she and Joyner were previously engaged to be married and that the relationship was more than friends at that time.Â  However, she asserted that she maintained a separate residence for the majority of the time since her divorce.Â  She conceded to living with Joyner during 1999 and again at the time of the filing of the instant action.Â  However, she stated the move in 1999 was due to her illness, and the recent cohabitation was for the purpose of providing Joynerâ€™s care.Â  Wife stated she acted as Joynerâ€™s primary caregiver after his stroke and moved into his residence solely for that reason.Â  Wife testified she slept on his couch or in a spare room, and she and Joyner did not have sex after his stroke.Â  \r\nJoyner also testified that the relationship with Wife was not romantic when she moved in with him after his stroke.Â  While he indicated Wife was the last person with whom he had a sexual relationship before his stroke, he also maintained it was not a recent sexual relationship.Â  Joyner testified Wife slept on his couch or in a spare room rent free.Â  He also admitted to giving her money to pay bills, but denied they had any joint accounts or that they commingled funds.Â  Finally, Joyner stated he was engaged at the time of the hearing to another woman.\r\nThe trial court found Wife and Joyner â€œenjoyed a relationship that lasted for 15 or more years.â€Â  The court placed emphasis on the testimony regarding Joynerâ€™s adopted child and the relationship between Wife and the child.Â  Additionally, the court found:Â  \r\n\r\nOur laws do not allow a supported spouse to purposefully circumvent the prohibition against romantic cohabitation in order to continue receiving alimony.Â  I find [Wife] cohabitated with a man (Joyner) and, therefore, [Husbandâ€™s] alimony obligation is reduced to zero.\r\n\r\nThe court then ordered Wife to reimburse Husband for alimony paid from the date he filed the complaint, totaling $7,700.00.Â  Finally, the court ordered Wife to pay $15,000.00 in Husbandâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nThe courtâ€™s decision to reduce the alimony to zero was based solely on the provision in the coupleâ€™s agreement and the Divorce Decree.Â  It was not based on a finding of a change in Wifeâ€™s economic condition.Â  However, the family court did not address whether Wifeâ€™s cohabitation with Joyner was romantic at the time the complaint was filed.Â  \r\nWifeâ€™s motion to alter or amend was denied by the family court.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992); Owens v. Owens, 320 S.C. 543, 546, 466 S.E.2d 373, 375 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  Nor must we ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981); Miles v. Miles, 355 S.C. 511, 516, 586 S.E.2d 136, 139 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Questions concerning alimony are left to the sound discretion of the trial judge, whose conclusions will not be disturbed absent a showing of abuse of discretion.Â  Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, 485, 477 S.E.2d 727, 729 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the court is controlled by some error of law or\r\nwhere the order, based upon the findings of fact, is without evidentiary support.â€Â  Engle v. Engle, 343 S.C. 444, 448-49, 539 S.E.2d 712, 714 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Reduction in Alimony\r\nWife argues the family court erred in reducing her alimony pursuant to the provision in the Final Order and Decree of Divorce.Â  Wife claims, although she had cohabitated in the past with Joyner in a romantic relationship, the court was in error because she was not presently cohabitating in a romantic relationship at the time the underlying action was filed.Â  Further, she contends the court erred in reducing the alimony to zero and requiring her to reimburse Husband for alimony paid after the filing of the complaint.Â  We affirm.\r\nAn unambiguous marital agreement incorporated into the partiesâ€™ divorce decree will be enforced according to the terms of the agreement.Â  Heins v. Heins, 344 S.C. 146, 158, 543 S.E.2d 224, 230 (Ct. App. 2001); see also Lindsay v. Lindsay, 328 S.C. 329, 491 S.E.2d 583 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œWhere an agreement is clear and capable of legal construction, the courtâ€™s only function is to interpret its lawful meaning and the intention of the parties as found within the agreement and give effect to it.â€Â  Ebert v. Ebert, 320 S.C. 331, 338, 465 S.E.2d 121, 125 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  \r\nâ€œWhen an agreement is unambiguous, effect should be given according to the ordinary and popular sense of the words employed therein.â€Â  Lacke v. Lacke, 362 S.C. 302, 308, 608 S.E.2d 147, 150 (Ct. App. 2005). Â â€œThe court must enforce an unambiguous contract according to its terms, regardless of the contractâ€™s wisdom or folly, or the partiesâ€™ failure to guard their rights carefully.â€Â  Heins, 344 S.C. at 158, 543 S.E.2d at 230 (citing Ellis v. Taylor, 316 S.C. 245, 449 S.E.2d 487 (1994)).Â  \r\nThe relevant provision in this case states:Â  â€œIf the Wife cohabitates with a man on a continuous and romantic basis, the alimony payment will be reduced to zero (0)[;] however[,] the obligation to pay alimony will not be terminated.â€ Â We find the provision is unambiguous and states clearly the conditions required for a reduction of the alimony payment to zero dollars.Â  Accordingly, the family court and this court are required to enforce the agreement pursuant to its terms.\r\nSection 20-3-150 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) provides insight into the ordinary and popular definition of the terms used in the provision:Â  â€œâ€˜continued cohabitationâ€™ means the supported spouse resides with another person in a romantic relationship for a period of ninety or more consecutive days.â€Â  The key term in this case is romantic which, while not specifically requiring the parties to have sexual relations, does require some level of intimacy and affection beyond that of an ordinary friendship. Â Â \r\nThe family court based its decision on the fact that Wife and Joyner were in a relationship for a period of fifteen years.Â  During that time Wife and Joyner became temporarily engaged and the relationship took on romantic qualities.Â  Also, during the course of their fifteen year relationship, Wife acted as a mother to Joynerâ€™s adopted daughter to the extent that the daughter believed Wife was, in fact, her mother.Â  Eventually, after Joynerâ€™s stroke, Wife moved in with Joyner as his caregiver and, in lieu of pay, lived rent free.Â  Wife also admitted she was living with Joyner when the underlying action was commenced, but maintains the relationship was not sexual.Â  We find there is evidence in the record to support a conclusion that Wifeâ€™s relationship with Joyner was more intimate than one between friends.Â  Therefore, we affirm the reduction of alimony to zero pursuant to the Final Order and Decree of Divorce.Â  We also affirm the courtâ€™s order requiring Wife to reimburse Husband for alimony payments since the filing of the underlying complaint.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nWife contends the court erred in requiring her to pay $15,000 of Husbandâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We agree.\r\nThe decision whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees is a matter within the family courtâ€™s sound discretion and will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, 415, 368 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1988).Â  In determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the court should consider the partiesâ€™ ability to pay their own fees, the beneficial results obtained by the attorney, the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions, and the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).\r\nHusband is in a much greater financial position to pay his own attorneyâ€™s fees compared to Wife.Â  According to financial declarations provided by the parties, Husband earns around $6,000 per month more than Wife.Â  In addition, Husband has approximately $350,000 more total property than Wife.Â  After subtracting spousal support pursuant to our holding in this case, Wife has a net monthly income of roughly $1,150.Â  Wifeâ€™s total property is valued at around $30,000.Â  Wife has far fewer assets and earnings than Husband.Â  In addition, Husband has the ability to pay his own fees, while Wifeâ€™s standard of living will be greatly decreased if she is forced to pay Husbandâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees in addition to her own.Â  Accordingly, based on our own review of the factors outlined in E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992), we find both parties shall bear the burden of their own attorneyâ€™s fees in the family court.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find there is evidence in the record to support the family courtâ€™s decision to reduce alimony to zero pursuant to the agreement incorporated into the Final Order and Decree of Divorce.Â  Additionally, we find that, analyzing this case under the factors outlined in E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992), it was error to require Wife to pay $15,000 of Husbandâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Therefore, the family courtâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.\r\nHEARN, C.J., WILLIAMS, J., and KEMMERLIN A.J., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-397","title":"State v.

State, 365 S.C. 130, 133, 616 S.E.2d 422, 423&nbsp;(2005) (stating competency to stand trial is a distinct issue from criminal responsibility for an offense; competency to stand trial involves the defendantâ€™s mental health at the time of trial, whereas the test for criminal responsibility concerns the defendantâ€™s mental health at the time of the offense); State v.

Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Â Â James Michael Houston (â€œHoustonâ€) was convicted of third degree burglary and petit larceny.Â  He was sentenced to eighteen months for the burglary charge and thirty days for larceny.Â  Houston appeals, arguing the judge erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn the morning of Sunday, March 7, 2004, police responded to a burglary complaint at ZJâ€™s Mobile Homes, a business involved in the refurbishing and reselling of used mobile homes.Â  The police met with the manager, Brenda Dill, and obtained statements from two eyewitnesses, Frank Barnes and Danny Underwood.Â  The police report indicated â€œa standard mobile home bathtub, white in color, approximately five feet long, and a box containing about six indoor faucetsâ€ were reported stolen from one of the mobile homes and placed in a green Cadillac.\r\nThe two witnesses identified Warren Paul Haney (â€œHaneyâ€) and Houston as the perpetrators of the crime.Â  A four-door, green Cadillac was found to be registered to Houston.Â  The police did not obtain search warrants for the homes of the two men.Â  The stolen items were never recovered.Â  The crime scene was not dusted for fingerprints, as police felt there was no good place in the unfurnished mobile home to check for fingerprints and that â€œthe best surface to print was probably the tub itself, which they had carried away . . . .â€ Â Â No other evidence was recovered from the crime scene.Â  \r\nAs a result of the witnessesâ€™ reports and police investigation, Houston and Haney were arrested and indicted for third degree burglary and petit larceny.Â  The two men were tried together.\r\nFrank Barnes worked at ZJâ€™s performing general remodeling work for more than two years.Â  Barnes testified that although ZJâ€™s is not open on Sundays, on the day in question, Underwood picked him up and drove to ZJâ€™s so they could â€œget caught upâ€ on some carpet installation they had been asked to perform.Â  \r\nBarnes testified that when he pulled up at the front entrance to the business, he observed Haney and Houston putting a bathtub from one of the mobile homes into the back of a green Cadillac.Â  Barnes recognized Haney, because they had worked together at ZJâ€™s.Â  Barnes and Underwood slowed their vehicle but did not stop.Â  Barnes testified he and Underwood parked near the office and walked back to the mobile home to see the men, but by that point, Haney and Houston were gone.Â  \r\nBarnes recalled he had recently worked in the mobile home and there was a bathtub either installed or sitting inside the mobile home at the time.Â  Barnes testified that he had worked in that same mobile home with Haney. Â He stated the mobile home was not locked after they finished working in it and that most of the mobile homes at ZJâ€™s stayed unlocked.Â  Barnes also recalled that Haney took his tools with him when they finished their work.Â  \r\nDanny Underwood also worked at ZJâ€™s.Â  Underwood testified that he had known Haney for approximately 30 years.Â  Before working at ZJâ€™s, Underwood had worked for Haney for around two years and had previously helped Houston with a few projects.\r\nUnderwood testified that as soon as he and Barnes drove into ZJâ€™s lot, Underwood observed what he recognized as Houstonâ€™s Cadillac parked in front of a mobile home in which he had been working.Â  Underwood testified that Houston stood on the steps of the mobile home â€œcoming out the doorâ€ and that Haney â€œwas putting the bathtub in the back seat.â€Â  Underwood observed them for three or four minutes, trying to ascertain what it was Haney and Houston were doing, but by the time he parked his vehicle and walked to the mobile home, Haney and Houston had left.Â  \r\nUnderwood explained that the bathtub was approximately fifty-three to fifty-four inches long and twenty-six to twenty-seven inches high.Â  It has only one side, because â€œthe rest of it mounts around the wallâ€ with screws and brackets.Â  The tub was made of thin plastic, not fiberglass, so that â€œ[y]ou can bow that bathtub so it will fit the wall so you ainâ€™t got to tear that wall out of the mobile home.â€Â  Underwood said the tub would buckle and was â€œflexible,â€ but would not fold up.Â  Underwood recalled the bathtub was not â€œhangingâ€ out the window of the car.Â  \r\nUnderwood testified that he and Haney put the bathtub in the mobile home a week before the burglary.Â  He said that Haney then quit his job at ZJâ€™s.Â  Underwood said that the bathtub was inside the mobile home on the night before the burglary.Â  He stated, â€œ[W]e set the bathtub in and it was supposed to be installed, but I had to go do something else so I never made it back up there.Â  So I assumed it was installed, but evidently it hadnâ€™t been, because they didnâ€™t tear the wall.Â  He didnâ€™t tear the screws or nothing out.â€Â  Underwood testified that Haney left no tools in the mobile home, but he left a stepladder, which was still there after the burglary. \r\nBrenda Dill testified that she hired Haney in November 2003.Â  He was paid by the job and allowed to bring a helper (Underwood) with him to work.Â  Dill explained that she and Haney â€œagreed to go separate waysâ€ and that Haney left on â€œdecent terms.â€Â  There was no agreement for Haney to finish any work.Â  She had never before seen Houston at ZJâ€™s.Â  Dill stated that Houston did not have permission to enter the mobile home and that Haney did not have permission to enter the mobile home after he stopped working there.Â  \r\nDill stated that the stolen bathtub cost about two hundred dollars.Â  The faucets were around thirty-nine dollars.Â  She explained that every evening when she closes the business, she checks all the mobile homes to make sure the windows and doors are shut.Â  Dill went through the mobile home and â€œjust pulled [the door] shut [and] went to the next one.â€Â  She did not lock the door and admitted that all the trailers remain unlocked â€œmost of the time.â€ Â Dill closed ZJâ€™s around four oâ€™clock on Saturday.Â  She was the last person to leave. \r\nDill testified that the tub was still in the mobile home when she closed Saturday.Â  She stated, â€œIt was sitting in the slot, in the opening where it belongs, and it was partially in, but not completed . . . .â€Â  No plumbing or other installation had been done.Â  She explained, â€œWe may leave things undone in one we donâ€™t have a deal working on.â€Â  She did not see any tools or a ladder in the mobile home when she walked through it. \r\nDill testified that, on past occasions, she had transported these types of bathtubs in the back seat of her mid-sized Chrysler Cirrus.\r\nHouston testified in his own defense.Â  Houston stated that he sold â€œhigh-endâ€ manufactured and modular homes for the Gallery of Homes in Powdersville.Â  Houston testified that he drove to ZJâ€™s with Haney on the Sunday morning in question so Haney could â€œshow [him] the work he had personally done in the kitchen putting the cabinets in this particular home.â€Â  He stated that he and Haney went into the mobile home and that Haney retrieved his triangle and a ladder, which he then put in the back seat of the car. Houston believed they were there for about five minutes.Â  Houston said he saw Barnes and Underwood pull into the lot.Â  Houston claimed that neither he nor Haney went into the bathroom of the mobile home or put a bathtub in his backseat.Â  He said the type of tub stolen would not be used in any of his mobile homes.Â  Houston admitted that he did not have permission to enter the mobile home. \r\nAt trial, Houston moved for a directed verdict in his favor, arguing the evidence did not establish that he intended to commit a crime in the mobile home or that he intended to steal the property.Â  The judge denied this motion.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the denial of a directed verdict against a criminal defendant, an appellate court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 46, 515 S.E.2d 525, 531 (1999).Â  The appellate court may reverse the trial judgeâ€™s denial of a motion for a directed verdict only if there is no evidence to support the judgeâ€™s ruling.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 546, 555, 564 S.E.2d 87, 82 (2002).Â  It is well settled that â€œif there is any direct or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, an appellate court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.â€Â  State v. Lollis, 343 S.C. 580, 584, 541 S.E.2d 254, 256 (2001); see also State v. Horton, 359 S.C. 555, 598 S.E.2d 279 (Ct. App. 2004) (noting a trial judge should deny a motion for a directed verdict if there is any direct of substantial circumstantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove the accusedâ€™s guilt or from which guilt can be fairly and logically deduced).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nWhen ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial judge is concerned with the existence of evidence, not its weight.Â  Burdette, 335 S.C. at 46, 515 S.E.2d at 531.Â  A defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged or raises a mere suspicion that the defendant is guilty.Â  See State v. Arnold, 361 S.C. 386, 390, 605 S.E.2d 529, 531 (2004); State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 97, 544 S.E.2d 30, 36 (2001).Â  However, a trial judge is not required to find that the evidence infers guilt to the exclusion of any other reasonable hypothesis.Â  State v. Zeigler, 364 S.C. 94, 102-103, 610 S.E.2d 859, 863 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\nThe offense of third degree burglary requires, among other things, evidence that the defendant entered a building with the intent to commit a crime therein.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-313 (2003).Â  Absent an admission by the defendant, intent may be inferred from his conduct.Â  State v. Haney, 257 S.C. 89, 91-92, 184 S.E.2d 344, 345 (1971).Â  Larceny is the taking and carrying away of the goods of another against the ownerâ€™s will or without his consent and with the felonious intent to permanently deprive the owner of his property and to convert it to the use of the taker.Â  State v. Williams, 237 S.C. 252, 116 S.E.2d 858, (1960); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-30(A) (2003) (proving the statutory maximum value for petit larceny).\r\nIt is undisputed that Houston drove Haney to ZJâ€™s on the Sunday morning in question, a time when ZJâ€™s was not open for business.Â  The two men entered the mobile home where Haney had previously been working.Â  Neither Haney nor Houston had permission to be there.Â  Houston was seen coming out of the mobile home while Haney was loading the stolen bathtub into Houstonâ€™s automobile.Â  Considered in the light most favorable to the State, this was more than sufficient evidence that Houston was not only present in the mobile home but was also involved with Haney in the commission of a burglary and larceny of the property in question.Â  State v. Crawford, 362 S.C. 627, 608 S.E.2d 886 (Ct. App. 2005); see also Burdette, 335 S.C. at 45, 515 S.E.2d at 531 (stating when two or more persons aid, abet, and encourage one another in the commission of a crime, all being present, each is guilty as a principal); State v. Chavis, 277 S.C. 521, 522, 290 S.E.2d 412, 412-413 (1982) (holding that when several people pursue a common design to commit an unlawful act, the act of one is the act of all, and all are presumed to be present and guilty); State v. Condrey, 349 S.C. 184, 193-95, 562 S.E.2d 320, 324 (Ct. App. 2002) (holding that â€œunder the â€˜hand of one is the hand of allâ€™ theory, one who joins with another to accomplish an illegal purpose is liable criminally for everything done by his confederate incident to the execution of the common design or purposeâ€).\r\nIntent is seldom susceptible to proof by direct evidence and must ordinarily be proven by facts and circumstances from which intent may be inferred.Â  State v. Tuckness, 257 S.C. 295, 185 S.E.2d 607 (1971).Â  The salient circumstances previously noted were more than sufficient to demonstrate Houstonâ€™s intent that morning.Â  Additionally, the intent to commit a crime could be inferred from the breaking and entering into the mobile home.Â  See State v. Perry, 279 S.C. 539, 309 S.E.2d 9 (1983) (holding that where the defendant was apprehended while attempting to flee the grounds of a school which had just recently been broken into, her intent to commit a crime therein was properly left for the jury to decide); Haney, 257 S.C. 89, 184 S.E.2d 344 (holding evidence of the intent to commit a crime was sufficient because the defendant broke into a room where movie projectors and other visual aids were kept and the unexplained breaking and entry was itself evidence of intent to commit larceny); see also State v. Pinckney, 339 S.C. 346, 529 S.E.2d 526 (2000) (stating a personâ€™s actions after entering a house may be evidence of the personâ€™s intent to commit a crime at the time of entry).\r\nNotwithstanding direct evidence of the crimes and Houstonâ€™s participation in them, the lack of any other physical evidence (such as fingerprints inside the mobile home or Houstonâ€™s possession of the stolen property) was a factual issue for the jury to consider and does not undermine the verdict.Â  State v. Davenport, 321 S.C. 134, 137, 467 S.E.2d 258, 260 n.2 (Ct. App. 1995); State v. Smith, 307 S.C. 376, 385, 415 S.E.2d 409, 414 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  The motion for a directed verdict was properly refused.\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nAccordingly, the trial judge did not err in refusing to direct a verdict in Houstonâ€™s favor and his convictions are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-399","title":"Cooksey v.

Cooksey (â€œCookseyâ€) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order granting a directed verdict for Wachovia Bank, N.A. (â€œWachoviaâ€).Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nAs early as May 2002, Cooksey maintained a personal checking account with Wachovia.Â  This account was primarily funded through Social Security benefits deposited into the account on a monthly basis via direct deposit.Â  In addition to the Social Security funds, Cooksey occasionally made other deposits into the account.Â  Along with the above-mentioned personal checking account, Cooksey maintained a Wachovia joint checking account with her husband.Â  Overdraft protection was provided to this joint checking account through a â€œReady Reserveâ€ account Wachovia provided the couple. \r\nThe Ready Reserve account was not paid according to its terms and was ultimately charged off by Wachovia.Â  To recover this debt, Wachovia offset Cookseyâ€™s personal checking account by the amount owed.Â  As a consequence of the offset and the resulting lower balance in her personal checking account, several checks written by Cooksey were returned for insufficient funds.Â  These bounced checks caused her to incur various penalties and fees from Wachovia and several of the checksâ€™ named payees.\r\nFrom May 20, 2002 through June 17, 2004, a total of $18,722.00 in Social Security benefits was deposited into Cookseyâ€™s personal account.Â  Deposits other than Social Security totaled $7,520.52, bringing the total for all deposits to $26,242.52.Â  During this approximately two-year period, Cooksey wrote checks on her Wachovia account totaling $18,805.43, leaving a remaining balance of $7,437.09.Â  \r\nThe offset to the Ready Reserve took place on May 19, 2004 and was for the sum of $5,188.76.Â  This amount, which was less than the net remaining balance, was approximately $2,000 less than the non-Social Security deposits made by Cooksey into her personal checking account.Â  Phrased differently, the total of the non-Social Security funds deposited into Cookseyâ€™s checking account during the two years prior to the offset exceeded the amount offset by Wachovia.Â  \r\nCooksey brought this action alleging wrongful dishonor and wrongful offset.Â  The underlying basis for the claims is that Wachovia did not have the right to offset Cookseyâ€™s account because the funds in the account were received from Social Security benefits.Â  At trial, upon the conclusion of Cookseyâ€™s case, Wachovia moved for a directed verdict, which the judge granted.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œ[O]nly where there is no evidence to support the ruling, or where the ruling in controlled by an error of lawâ€ should an appellate court overturn the grant of a directed verdict.Â  Hinkle v. Natâ€™l Cas. Ins. Co., 354 S.C. 92, 96, 579 S.E.2d 616, 618 (2003).Â  â€œEssentially, our court must resolve whether it would be reasonably conceivable to have a verdict for a party opposing the motion under facts as liberally construed in the opposing partyâ€™s favor.â€ Â Huffines Co., LLC v. Lockhart, 365 S.C. 178, 188-189, 617 S.E.2d 125,130 (Ct. App. 2005) (internal citations omitted).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1. The Grant of the Directed Verdict\r\nCooksey contends that the trial court improperly granted the motion for a directed verdict at the conclusion of Cookseyâ€™s case, because Wachovia had not yet presented evidence of affirmative defenses.Â  However, the trial judgeâ€™s ruling was not in response to any of Wachoviaâ€™s affirmative defenses, but was instead because Cookseyâ€™s legal theory, that the Social Security funds deposited in her checking account were exempt from offset, was incorrect.Â  Additionally, the trial court found the evidence established that, even if such benefits were exempt, there were sufficient non-exempt funds deposited into Cookseyâ€™s account to cover the offset sum.\r\nFurthermore, even if the trial courtâ€™s ruling was based on affirmative defenses, there is nothing that prevents a defendant from proving such defenses through witnesses and evidence presented by the plaintiff.Â  While it is well settled that the party asserting an affirmative defense bears the burden of establishing that defense through a preponderance of the evidence, Lorick &amp; Lowrance, Inc. v. Julius H. Walker &amp; Co., 153 S.C. 309, 318, 150 S.E. 789, 792 (1929); see also 61A Am. Jur. 2d Pleading Â§ 298 (1999), a directed verdict may be granted based on an affirmative defense at the conclusion of the plaintiffâ€™s case without requiring the defendant to prove the defenses through its case-in-chief.Â  See Eargle v. Sumter Lighting Co., 110 S.C. 560, 566, 96 S.E. 909, 911 (1918) (â€œWe have held in numerous cases . . . a nonsuit should have been granted at the conclusion of the plaintiffâ€™s testimony . . . .â€).Â  Evidence of an affirmative defense is not limited to that which is presented by the party asserting the defense.Â  See id. (â€œIt is immaterial from whose witnesses--whether plaintiffâ€™s or defendantâ€™s--the evidence in support of an element of damage or of the cause of action or defense may come.Â  Either party has the right to make out or strengthen its case or defense on the examination of the witness of his adversary.â€).Â  \r\nAccordingly, the trial court properly granted Wachoviaâ€™s motion for a directed verdict at the conclusion of Cookseyâ€™s case, without requiring Wachovia to present its defense.\r\n2. Offset Against Funds\r\nCookseyâ€™s claim for wrongful dishonor and wrongful offset is predicated on the theory that Social Security benefits are exempt from offset under state and federal law.Â  She contends the funds in her checking account were not subject to offset because they were comprised, at least in part, of her Social Security income.Â  However, the statutes that protect such benefits from attachment, levy and garnishment do not apply to protect these funds from offsets.Â  \r\nSouth Carolina recognizes a common law right of offset.Â  Lee v. Marion National Bank, 167 S.C. 168, 166 S.E. 148 (1932).Â  If a depositor is indebted to his bank, â€œthe bank has the right to offset the indebtedness by the depositâ€“unless there are conditions or agreements attending the deposit which preclude it.â€Â  Lee, 167 S.C. at 200, 166 S.E. at 160.Â  \r\nWith regard to the protection afforded Social Security benefits under federal law, the United States Code provides that the â€œright of any person to any future payment under this subchapter shall not be transferable or assignable, at law or in equity, and none of the moneys paid or payable or rights existing under this subchapter shall be subject to execution, levy attachment, garnishment, or other legal process, or to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.â€Â  42 U.S.C. Â§ 407(a) (1998).Â  In interpreting the extent of the protection provided by this statute, the United States Supreme Court, in Washington State v. Keffeler, 537 U.S. 371, 123 S.Ct. 1017 (2003), construed this statute very narrowly.Â  \r\nIn Keffeler, the state of Washington provided foster care to certain children removed from their parentsâ€™ custody and received Social Security benefits as the representative payee for many of those children.Â  Keffeler filed a class action, alleging, inter alia, that the stateâ€™s use of benefits to reimburse itself for the foster case costs violated 42 U.S.C. Â§ 407(a).Â  The Supreme Court held that attachment, levy, or other legal process contemplates the utilization of some judicial or quasi-judicial mechanism and that neither the stateâ€™s effort to become a representative payee, nor its use of Keffelerâ€™s Social Security benefits when it acted in that capacity, amounted to employing an â€œexecution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal processâ€ under Â§ 407(a).Â  Because the stateâ€™s activities did not involve any of the specified formal procedures, such as execution, attachment, levy, or garnishment, the issue was whether the stateâ€™s actions constituted â€œother legal process.â€Â  The court reasoned that the statute uses that term restrictively, and under the established interpretive canons of noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis, where general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration, the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar to those enumerated by the specific words.Â  Keffeler, 537 U.S. 371, 372, 123 S.Ct. 1017, 1019. Â Thus, â€œother legal processâ€ should be understood to be a process much like execution, levy, attachment, and garnishment.Â  At a minimum, it would require utilization of some judicial or quasi-judicial mechanism by which control over property passes from one person to another in order to discharge or secure discharge of an allegedly existing or anticipated liability. \r\nSouth Carolina law provides a similar protection for Social Security benefits, stating that Social Security benefits are â€œexempt from attachment, levy, and sale under any mesne or final process issued by any court or bankruptcy proceeding . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-41-30(10)(a) (2005).Â  However, like its federal counterpart, the statute does not provide protection from offset.Â  The reasoning and analysis of the United States Supreme Court in Keffeler can be applied to the South Carolina statute.Â  Nothing in Section 15-41-30 addresses the issue of offsets.Â  Instead, the state makes reference only to a â€œprocess issued by any court or bankruptcy proceeding . . . .â€Â  The law is clearly directed only to judicial mechanisms for the collection of debts.Â  Thus, there is no basis for Cookseyâ€™s contention that Social Security benefits are protected from offset.\r\nAbsent a statute or other law or regulation that prohibits offsets against funds received from Social Security, Cookseyâ€™s claims of wrongful setoff and wrongful dishonor fail as a matter of law.\r\n3. Non-Social Security Deposits Exceeded the Amount Offset\r\nThe total amount of funds deposited into Cookseyâ€™s checking account from sources other than social security exceeded the amount of offset.Â  As such, Cooksey cannot show the offset that occurred was against the social security benefits and not the funds from other sources.Â  As reflected in the exhibits presented by Cooksey at trial, the total of the non-Social Security funds deposited into her checking account during the approximately two-year period prior to the offset exceeded the amount offset by Wachovia.Â  During this time, a total of $18,722.00 in Social Security benefits was deposited into Cookseyâ€™s account.Â  Deposits other than Social Security totaled $7,520.52, so that the total of all deposits was $26,242.52.Â  \r\nThroughout this two year period, Cooksey wrote checks on her Wachovia account totaling $18,805.43, leaving the remaining balance $7,437.09.Â  The amount of the offset was $5,188.76.Â  This amount was substantially less than the non-Social Security deposits she made and was less than the net balance remaining in her account.Â  Therefore, even if Cookseyâ€™s Social Security benefits were exempt from offset, her checking account contained sufficient deposits from other sources to cover the offset.Â  As a result, Cooksey did not present facts to support her claims of wrongful offset and wrongful dishonor.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe evidence presented by Cooksey was insufficient to establish the causes of action alleged and thus supports the directed verdict award.Â  Likewise, Cookseyâ€™s legal theory underlying her claims was incorrect, and the trial judge correctly ruled on the legal issues in granting Wachoviaâ€™s motion. Moreover, the evidence presented at trial established that she deposited funds from sources other than Social Security that exceeded the amount of the offset.Â  Therefore, neither a legal nor factual basis for the claims against Wachovia existed.Â  The trial courtâ€™s ruling correctly granted a directed verdict in favor of Wachovia and accordingly is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-400","title":"State v.

Savitz, III, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney Donald J. Zelenka,Â  Assistant Attorney General S. Creighton Waters, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Jerry W. Peace, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Derek J. Brown appeals his convictions for murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, for which he received concurrent sentences of life imprisonment and five years, respectively. Â Brown argues the trial judge erred by refusing to direct a verdict acquitting him of the charges.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThis case involves the drive-by shooting of fourteen-year-old Phillip Johnson, Jr. on August 4, 2001.Â  Corey Shelton, Derek Brown, and Ricky Latimore were indicted with murder and possession of a firearm or a knife during commission of a violent crime in connection with this incident.[2]Â  \r\nOn the night of the shooting, Johnson, his cousin Xavier Smith, and a number of friends attended a high school football game.Â  After leaving the football game, the boys went to a friendâ€™s house on Pleasant View Drive, and â€œhung outâ€ with ten to twelve boys in the front yard.Â  Smith testified that around 11:00 to 11:30 p.m., a large, dark-colored car, which had been parked nearby when the boys arrived, came down the road with two guns firing out the windows.Â  Someone in the group fired back at the car as it drove away.Â  Johnson was shot in the drive-by.Â  \r\nJohnson died from his gunshot wound on the way to the hospital.Â  Bullet fragments removed from his body were sent to SLED for testing.Â  At the scene, officers found fifteen 7.62mm casings, seven .45 casings, as well as a 9mm casing.Â  Bullets that penetrated a nearby residence were also sent to SLED for testing.Â  \r\nSmith could not identify the people in the assailantâ€™s car.Â  Directly after the drive-by, he gave the police the names of Terrence Bishop, Darrell Brown, and â€œK,â€ but testified that those were just the names of some boys with whom he had gotten into an argument at the football game.Â  Smith also told the police at the scene that the car was green, while at trial he only remembered that it was dark.Â  \r\nOn August 25, 2001, Darryl Mosely was brought to the police station where he provided a statement against the co-defendants, who are his cousins.Â  At trial, Mosely retracted his statement, claiming that he never read the statement, that he was lying because the officers threatened his life, and that they had fed him the details and information in his statement.Â  He did, however, admit on cross-examination that the statement accurately reflected what he told the officer.Â  He also admitted at trial that he had seen the three defendants together before they left the â€œLionâ€™s Den,â€ but that he did not see any of them with a gun.Â  \r\nMoselyâ€™s original statement to police contained more incriminating information.Â  He said that on the night of the incident, he saw Shelton with an SKS rifle and a banana clip strapped around his neck.[3]Â  He stated that the three defendants then got into a green four-door Pontiac Catalina and drove off.Â  \r\nOn August 26, 2001, defendant Corey Shelton told Captain Williams where he could locate an AK-47.Â  Officers went to the place he described and found an AK-47, some banana clips for the AK-47, and a .32 caliber revolver.Â  \r\nDefendant Derrick Brown made a statement to Chief Deputy Eddie Smith.Â  In the statement, Brown said that at about 11:00 to 11:30 p.m., on the night of the shooting, he was driving down Pleasant View Drive in his Green Pontiac Catalina and drinking beer when he heard a shot.Â  He said that he thought someone was shooting at him, so he pulled out his .45 caliber pistol and fired it out the window as he drove away.Â  He stated he then hid the gun.Â  Brown claimed he did not know who he was shooting at and did not know Phillip Johnson.Â  After he had made this statement, Brown personally led police to where he hid the .45 caliber pistol.Â  \r\nThe SLED examiner found that the bullet fragment taken from Johnson was too damaged to conclusively identify whether it came from Sheltonâ€™s AK-47, but that its characteristics indicated it could have been fired from his weapon.Â  The bullet that killed Johnson was not from a .45 pistol.Â  The fifteen 7.62mm casings found at the scene were the type that could have been fired from Sheltonâ€™s AK-47.Â  All seven of the .45 casings found at the scene were matched to Brownâ€™s .45 caliber pistol.Â  The SLED examiner also conclusively matched the bullet that had penetrated a nearby house to Brownâ€™s pistol.Â  Revolvers like Sheltonâ€™s .32 caliber do not automatically eject casings, which explains why none were found at the scene, but the SLED examiner did conclusively match Sheltonâ€™s revolver to the other bullet that had penetrated a nearby house.Â  \r\nAt the end of the Stateâ€™s case and again at the conclusion of the trial, Brown moved for a directed verdict, arguing the State failed to introduce any evidence he murdered Johnson.Â  The motions were denied, and the jury convicted Brown of both murder and possession of a firearm during commission of a violent crime.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBrown challenges the trial judgeâ€™s denial of his motion for a directed verdict.Â  Specifically, he argues that there was not substantial circumstantial evidence that Brown committed, or aided and abetted the commission of, the murder of Philip Johnson.Â  This argument has no merit.\r\nWhen reviewing the denial of a directed verdict, a South Carolina appellate court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the State to determine if there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused.Â  State v. Curtis, 356 S.C. 622, 633-34, 591 S.E.2d 600, 605 (2004); State v. Zeigler, 364 S.C. 94, 101-2, 610 S.E.2d 859, 863 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  If there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused, or from which his guilt can be fairly and logically deduced, then the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  State v. Martin, 340 S.C. 597, 602, 533 S.E.2d 572, 574 (2000); State v. Cooper, 334 S.C. 540, 551-52, 514 S.E.2d 584, 590 (1999).Â  Evidence that merely raises a suspicion the accused is guilty is not sufficient to survive a directed verdict motion.Â  State v. Buckmon, 347 S.C. 316, 321, 555 S.E.2d 402, 404 (2001); State v. Muhammed, 338 S.C. 22, 26, 524 S.E.2d 637, 639 (Ct. App. 1999).Â Â  \r\nBrown contends that â€œ[a]t best, the State proved that Brown fired a forty-five pistol near where Johnson was killed at approximately the same time he was hit by a bullet fired from a different gun.â€ Â We disagree.\r\nThe Stateâ€™s case against Brown was based upon the theory that â€œthe hand of one is the hand of all,â€ which does not require that Brownâ€™s gun fired the fatal bullet.Â  Rather, one who joins with another to accomplish an illegal purpose is liable criminally for everything done by his confederate incidental to the execution of the common design and purpose.Â  State v. Langley, 334 S.C. 643, 648, 515 S.E.2d 98, 101 (1999). The State introduced substantial circumstantial evidence to support this theory. Â The State proved that Brown fired his forty-five caliber pistol in the vicinity of Johnson at approximately the same time he was killed; Brown admitted as much with his statements and his testimony.Â  In addition to placing Brown at the scene and firing his weapon at the time of the crime, the State presented substantial circumstantial and direct evidence linking Brown to the car used in the crime, and to Shelton, who was linked to an AK-47 used at the crime scene which fired ammunition consistent with that which killed Johnson.Â  This evidence is sufficient to support submission to the jury.Â  See State v. Weston, 367 S.C 279, 625 S.E.2d 641 (2006)(finding circumstantial evidence sufficient to support conviction for murder where victimâ€™s body was never found but she had mysteriously disappeared, Â and where physical evidence at the residence defendant and victim shared, alongside defendantâ€™s suspicious behavior indicated a murder might have taken place); State v. Freiburger, 366 S.C. 125, 620 S.E.2d 737 (2005)(finding circumstantial evidence sufficient to support conviction for a cab-driverâ€™sÂ  murder where there was evidence that on the day of the murder, the defendant bought the same type of gun that killed the victim, where two days after the murderÂ  he was staying at a motel close to where the victimâ€™s cab was found, and where the defendant was arrested with the gun that ballistics indicated killed the victim); State v. East, 353 S.C 634, 578 S.E.2d 748, (Ct. App. 2003)(finding defendant not entitled to a directed verdict on one of seven counts of kidnapping where victim of that count did not testify, but other witnesses testified that victim was present at the scene).Â  Given the aforementioned substantial circumstantial evidence linking Brown to the murder, and viewing it in the light most favorable to the State, the circuit courtâ€™s denial of the motion for directed verdict, and submission of the case to the jury, was proper.\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nBased on the foregoing, the decision of the circuit court is hereby\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215(a), SCACR.\r\n[2] At the conclusion of the Stateâ€™s case, and with the consent of the State, the judge directed a verdict aquitting Latimore.\r\n[3] An SKS is a Chinese-made rifle very similar to an AK-47, which fires the same ammunition, and the two rifles are commonly referred to by each otherâ€™s names.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-401","title":"SCDSS v.

Taggart, of Columbia, for Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Father appeals from a family court order terminating his parental rights to his three minor children.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFather and Mother[2] adopted three children in July 1999:Â  Child A, Child J, and Child S.Â  On March 7, 2003, the South Carolina Department of Social Services (SCDSS) took the children into emergency protective custody following allegations of abuse.Â  Father and Mother entered negotiated Alford[3] pleas to charges of abuse and neglect in July 2003.\r\nSCDSS initiated the present action to terminate Father and Motherâ€™s parental rights in August 2004.Â  A five-day hearing took place from May 2, 2005 through May 6, 2005.Â  Father testified that he and his wife made the children drink a substance they named â€œliarâ€™s cocktail,â€ a combination of â€œvegetable juice and condiments from the refrigerator, not necessarily harmful but just a little unpleasant combination.â€Â  The children claimed the cocktails would include such substances as hot sauce, fish sauce, and even shampoo.Â  If the children threw up while drinking the cocktail, they were allegedly forced to eat the vomit.Â  \r\nFather also admitted feeding the children baby food and forcing them to exercise.Â  Father repeatedly characterized the abuse as necessary forms of discipline because the children had special needs.Â  Evidence presented at trial indicated that all three children had been severely beaten.Â  Child A and Child J were found with bruises consistent with the pattern of an inflicted injury.Â  All three children developed post-traumatic stress disorder from the abuse.Â  \r\nThe childrenâ€™s guardian ad litem testified about her extensive experience with the children, which included weekly visits beginning in July 2003.Â  According to the guardian, the children did not want to return to Father and terminating his parental rights was in their best interests.\r\nAt the close of evidence, the parties waived closing arguments.Â  Fatherâ€™s counsel attempted to dismiss the action through a post-trial motion alleging multiple instances of SCDSS non-compliance with hearing requirements.Â  The court reserved ruling on the motion until its final order.\r\nIn June 2005, the family court issued an order terminating Fatherâ€™s parental rights on the grounds that (1) the children had been harmed and that it was not reasonably likely the home would be made safe within twelve months; (2) Father had not remedied the conditions that caused the childrenâ€™s removal; (3) Father willfully failed to provide support to the children except for medical insurance; (4) the children had been in SCDSS foster care for at least fifteen of the preceding twenty-two months; and finding that the termination of Fatherâ€™s parental rights was in the childrenâ€™s best interests.Â  The court did not rule on Fatherâ€™s post-trial motion.Â  Father did not make a motion for reconsideration.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn a TPR case, the best interest of the child is the paramount consideration.Â  Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App. 2003). Â Before parental rights can be forever terminated, the alleged grounds for the termination must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Richberg v. Dawson, 278 S.C. 356, 357, 296 S.E.2d 338, 339 (1982); South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999). Â On appeal, this court may review the record and make its own determination of whether the grounds for termination are supported by clear and convincing evidence.Â \r\nSouth Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 293, 547 S.E.2d 506, 509 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Despite this broad scope of review, however, we should not necessarily disregard the findings of the family court because the family court is in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and assign weight to their testimony.Â \r\nDorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nFather alleges the family court committed several errors in denying his motion to dismiss.Â  Father alleges the family court erred in failing to dismiss the termination of parental rights action because (1) a hearing on the merits was not held within the time mandated by South Carolina Code section 20-7-610(M); (2) SCDSS failed to schedule hearings every twelve months to review whether the conditions requiring removal continued to exist, as required by South Carolina Code section 20-7-762; (3) SCDSSâ€™s noncompliance with subsection C of 20-7-762 deprived the family court of jurisdiction; and (4) SCDSS failed to have the termination hearing within one year from the permanency planning hearing pursuant to South Carolina Code section 20-7-766(I)(2).Â  Father argues the family court was deprived of subject matter jurisdiction due to these four issues.Â  These issues are not preserved.\r\nâ€œ[S]ubject matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.â€Â  State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 100, 610 S.E.2d 494, 498 (2005).Â  â€œ[T]he family courtâ€™s compliance with the statutory time limits is not an issue of subject matter jurisdiction.â€Â \r\nSouth Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Meek, 352 S.C. 523, 533 n.3, 575 S.E.2d 846, 851 n.3 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  We held in Meek that â€œthe remedy for the failure to complete the hearing within the specified time limits was . . . to petition for the return of\r\n[the] children or move to vacate the order granting custody to DSS.â€Â  352 S.C. at 532, 575 S.E.2d at 851-52.Â  \r\nFather briefly raised the four issues at the close of all the evidence, but the family court reserved ruling on them.Â  In its final order, the family court did not rule on any of these issues.Â  Father failed to make a motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCACR.Â  Because these issues do not affect the family courtâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction, they are not preserved for appellate review.Â  See McCall v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 359 S.C. 372, 381, 597 S.E.2d 181, 186 (Ct. App. 2004) (holding an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review); Jones v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 364 S.C. 222, 235, 612 S.E.2d 719, 726 (Ct. App. 2005) (â€œAn issue is\r\nnot preserved where the trial court does not explicitly rule on an argument and the appellant does not make a\r\nRule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment.â€).\r\nNext, Father alleges (1) clear and convincing evidence does not exist to support the family courtâ€™s findings that SCDSS made reasonable efforts to reunify the family, and (2) the family court erred in finding no treatment plan was ordered on July 31, 2003.Â  Father does not indicate how these alleged errors mandate reversal.\r\nRegardless, Father does not challenge the family courtâ€™s decision to terminate his parental rights on the grounds that he willfully failed to support the minor children and that the children had been in SCDSS foster care for at least fifteen of the preceding twenty-two months.Â  Moreover, Father does not challenge the family courtâ€™s finding that terminating Fatherâ€™s parental rights was in the childrenâ€™s best interests.Â  As a result, we are required to affirm the termination of Fatherâ€™s parental rights regardless of whether these arguments have merit.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2005) (providing that the family court may terminate parental rights if it finds at least one of the nine statutory grounds for termination has been met and that termination is in the\r\nbest interests of the child).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, STILWELL, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Mother died during the litigation of this case.\r\n[3]Â  North Carolina v.

Middleton, 295 S.C. 318, 322, 368 S.E.2d 457, 459 (1988).Â  â€œIt is not necessary that the perpetrator be armed throughout commission of the crime.â€Â  Id.  \r\n2.&nbsp; We find that the trial court properly instructed the jury that a robber need not be armed at all times to be found guilty of armed robbery as requested by the State.Â  See State v. Santiago, 370 S.C. 153, __, 634 S.E.2d 23, 26 (Ct. App. 2006) (â€œIf there is any evidence to support a jury charge, the trial judge should grant the requested charge.â€).Â Â  One of the key issues at trial was whether Mitchell could be guilty of armed robbery when he was not armed with a deadly weapon for the entirety of the crime.Â  The law of this state is that one need not be armed at all times during a crime to be guilty of armed robbery.Â  See State v. Keith, 283 S.C. 597, 598, 325 S.E.2d 325, 326 (1985) (â€œ[W]hen a defendant commits robbery without a deadly weapon, but becomes armed with a deadly weapon before asportation of the victimâ€™s property, a conviction for armed robbery will stand. Â â€˜[T]he robber need not be armed at all times during the robbery in order to be guilty of (armed robbery).â€™â€) (quoting 77 C.J.S. Robbery, Â§ 25 (1952)).Â  \r\nAccordingly, the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, STILWELL, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]\r\nWe decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-404","title":"In the Interest of Edward V.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayUnPubOpinion.cfm?caseNo=2006-UP-404","description":null,"date":"2006-12-11","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS OPINION HAS NO PRECEDENTIAL VALUE.Â  IT SHOULD NOT BE CITED OR RELIED ON AS&nbsp;\r\n PRECEDENT IN ANY PROCEEDING EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY RULE 239(d)(2), SCACR.\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Interest of Edward V., a Juvenile under the age of Seventeen,\r\nAppellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Greenwood County\r\nÂ Roger E.

Leevy, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nEdwin E. Evans, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â James Floyd appeals the affirmance of his termination from employment with the South Carolina Budget and Control Board (â€œthe Boardâ€).Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 2002, Frank Fusco, Executive Director of the Board, received an anonymous letter alleging, among other things, that several of the women working in the custodial area of the Boardâ€™s Division of General Services (â€œGeneral Servicesâ€), were being sexually harassed.Â  During the investigation that followed, several employees made allegations that Floyd sexually harassed and intimidated some custodial workers.Â  Jane,[2] one of Floydâ€™s subordinates, claimed she had a sexual encounter with Floyd at his apartment during her lunch break because he pressured her to have sex in order to preserve her job.Â  Jane described Floyd as living in â€œRutledge Apartments, Apartment 3,â€ a one-bedroom apartment with â€œa colonial style high bedâ€ with a dark-colored floral bedspread, a dresser with a picture of his mother on it, two night stands, and a chest of drawers with a picture of Floydâ€™s daughter on it.Â  Jill, a custodian under Floydâ€™s supervision, claimed Floyd made advances toward her and at one point grabbed and manhandled her.Â  Jill told Wanda Elm, a DSS employee in the building Jill cleaned, about the harassment, and Jill often hid from Floyd behind Elmâ€™s desk.Â Â  \r\nFloyd denied that he sexually harassed anyone and claimed that he was the actual victim of sexual harassment at the hands of Jane, Jill, and Cynthia, another employee under his supervision.Â  Floyd was suspended during the investigation.Â  After conducting interviews with numerous workers, including Floyd, Jane, and Jill, General Services determined Floyd had â€œengaged in a pattern of sexually harassing employees under [his] supervision.â€Â  Floyd was terminated.Â Â  \r\nFloyd, represented by counsel, appealed his termination to the Boardâ€™s Grievance Panel (â€œInternal Panelâ€).Â  After a hearing, the Internal Panel recommended that the termination of Floyd be upheld.Â  Fusco, Director of the Board, reviewed the Internal Panelâ€™s recommendation and upheld Floydâ€™s termination.Â  Floyd appealed to the State Employee Grievance Committee (â€œState Committeeâ€), and a de novo hearing was held.Â  After hearing testimony from thirteen witnesses, including Floyd, the State Committee unanimously upheld Floydâ€™s termination, finding the testimony of Jane and Jill to be more credible than that of Floyd.Â  The State Committee further stated:Â  â€œThe Committee finds [Floyd] failed to establish that the Agencyâ€™s decisions were inappropriate under the requirements of Â§ 8-17-340(E)(2).Â  Therefore, the Committee upholds the decision of the [Board] to terminate [Floyd] and denies the relief sought.â€Â Â  \r\nFloyd appealed his termination to the circuit court, alleging the State Committeeâ€™s decision was based solely on the testimony given by Jane and Jill.Â  Floyd further argued that â€œall the facts and evidence presented on [his] behalf were not given [fair] and proper consideration.â€Â  After a hearing, the circuit court determined there was sufficient evidence to support the State Committeeâ€™s findings and affirmed the final decision of the State Committee.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing a final decision of an administrative agency pursuant to South Carolina Code section 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005), the circuit court sits in an appellate capacity and is limited to considering whether the agency committed any errors.Â  Kiawah Resort Assoc. v. South Carolina Tax Commâ€™n, 318 S.C. 502, 505, 458 S.E.2d 542, 544 (1995).Â  The court â€œshall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005).Â  The court can reverse or modify the administrative agencyâ€™s decision if the substantive rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the agencyâ€™s decision was:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      (a)&nbsp;\r\n       in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (b)\r\n       in excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (c)\r\n       made upon unlawful procedure;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (d)\r\n       affected by other error of law;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (e)&nbsp;\r\n       clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantive evidence on the whole record; or\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (f)&nbsp;\r\n       arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005).Â  The findings of an administrative agency are presumed correct and will only be set aside if not supported by substantial evidence.Â  Rodney v. Michelin Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 515, 519, 466 S.E.2d 357, 359 (1996).Â  The burden is on the appellant to prove that the administrative agencyâ€™s decision is unsupported by the evidence.Â  Tennis v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 355 S.C. 551, 558, 585 S.E.2d 312, 316 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Substantial Evidence\r\nFloyd argues the circuit court erred in failing to reverse the State Committeeâ€™s affirmance of his termination by the Board because it was â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the record as a whole.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor evidence viewed blindly from one side, but is evidence which, when considering the whole record, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached.Â  Tennis, 355 S.C. at 558, 585 S.E.2d at 316.Â  The possibility of reaching two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not mean the administrative agencyâ€™s findings are not supported by substantial evidence.Â  Id.Â  \r\nFloyd complains that the Board and the State Committee failed to adequately consider:Â  (1) his testimony that he did not sexually harass Jane or Jill; (2) his exemplary twenty-year employment history with the Board; and (3) the fact that Jane could not accurately describe Floydâ€™s apartment number or the furniture in his apartment, despite her allegations that she went to Floydâ€™s apartment for a sexual encounter.Â  Although Floyd states he is not asking this court to weigh the credibility of the witnesses, he is essentially arguing that his testimony was more credible than the other witnesses.Â  Because the weight of the evidence, including the credibility of witnesses, is a determination left solely in the administrative agency, neither the circuit court nor this court can make credibility determinations.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005) (noting that the circuit court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the appellate agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact).Â  Â \r\nLooking at the evidence before the Board and the State Committee, we find there was substantial evidence to affirm Floydâ€™s termination.Â  Although Floyd claimed Jane and Jill were motivated to fabricate the sexual harassment allegations, the State Committee found their testimony more credible than Floydâ€™s.Â  Further, Wanda Elmâ€™s testimony corroborated Jillâ€™s allegations that Floyd appeared in her building several times to harass her.Â  Because there was substantial evidence to support the State Committeeâ€™s findings, the circuit court did not err in affirming Floydâ€™s termination.\r\nII.Â  Disciplinary Procedures\r\nFloyd argues the Board failed to follow its own disciplinary policy by failing to explore options other than termination.Â  Because of this failure, Floyd argues, the circuit court should have reversed the findings of the Board and the State Committee.Â  Floyd also argues that the Boardâ€™s failure to discipline Cynthia after Floyd complained that she sexually harassed him shows disparity in the implementation of the Boardâ€™s policy, requiring reversal.Â  We disagree.[3]Â  \r\nThe Boardâ€™s disciplinary policy provides that founded cases of harassment constitute misconduct subject to appropriate disciplinary action â€œup to and including dismissalâ€ in accordance with the progressive discipline policy.Â  Disciplinary actions range from counseling, an oral reprimand, a written reprimand, suspension, termination, reassignment, and demotion.Â  The disciplinary policy further provides that â€œ[w]hen an offense is of sufficient severity, disciplinary action may begin at a more advanced stage, including termination.â€Â  The following language precedes the section outlining particular punishments for particular offenses: \r\n\r\nThe disciplinary actions noted for the personal conduct offenses listed at the end of this section are guidelines and the agency is not bound to them.Â  These guidelines are intended to provide guidance, but the circumstances of the particular situations may warrant disciplinary action outside these Guidelines.Â  Discipline may begin at any step in the procedure depending on the seriousness of the individual offense.\r\n\r\nThe section further suggests a written reprimand to a suspension for a first occurrence of harassment, suspension to termination for a second occurrence, and termination for a third occurrence.Â Â Â  \r\nReviewing the Boardâ€™s policy, it is clear the Board had a range of disciplinary options in disciplining Floyd.Â  Although the disciplinary policy suggested a written reprimand to a suspension for a first occurrence of harassment, termination for a serious offense was also one of the options available to the Board.Â  The allegations against Floyd, which the Board and the State Committee found to be credible, included threats of demotion or firing if sexual favors were not given, grabbing an employee, and pressuring an employee to have sex with him.Â  These allegations were very serious.Â  Thus, we find the Board did not violate its progressive discipline policy by terminating Floyd for a â€œfirst occurrence.â€Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThere was substantial evidence to support the Boardâ€™s and the State Committeeâ€™s decision to terminate Floyd for sexual harassment.Â  Further, there is no evidence to support Floydâ€™s argument that the Board failed to follow its progressive disciplinary procedures.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the circuit court to uphold Floydâ€™s termination is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  We have changed the names of Floydâ€™s accusers to protect their identities.Â  \r\n[3] We note this issue may not be preserved for appellate review.Â  Floyd did not complain that the Board failed to follow its progressive disciplinary procedures in his appeal to the State Committee nor did he complain about it in his appeal to the circuit court.Â  Issues not raised to or ruled upon by the administrative agency are generally not preserved for appellate review by the circuit court or this court.Â  Kiawah Resort Assoc. v. South Carolina Tax Commâ€™n, 318 S.C. 502, 505-06, 458 S.E.2d 542, 544 (1995).Â  Despite not raising the issue in his appeals, Floyd argued the issue before the circuit court.Â  After recognizing that the issue was not preserved, the circuit court nevertheless addressed the merits of the issue.Â  Similarly, we will address the merits of Floydâ€™s argument.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-406","title":"SCDSS v.

Horner, of Columbia, for Appellant[1]\r\nCherolyn Roselle Allen, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  David G. (Father) appeals the family courtâ€™s findings that he abused his son (Child), and that he posed a substantial risk of abuse to his two other children.Â  Father argues the evidence does not support the family courtâ€™s decision.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nChild alleged that in an argument over attending church on Sunday March 6, 2005, Father grabbed him around the neck, lifted him off the floor, and held him in the air for â€œabout two minutes.â€Â  Child stated that he couldnâ€™t breathe or talk.Â  Child reported this occurrence to his school on Wednesday March 9, 2005, and the school reported the matter to the Richland County Sheriffâ€™s Department (the Police) who referred the matter to the South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS).Â  Father admitted arguing over Childâ€™s refusal to attend church, but denied choking Child and presented a different account of the events.Â  Father stated that after Child had slapped away and then grabbed his hand when he tried to present Child with a shirt for church, he put his hand on Childâ€™s chest and held Child against the wall.Â  Father stated that the securing of Child against the wall lasted only long enough for him to inform Child that going to church was not up for debate.Â Â Â Â  \r\nDSS took all three children into emergency protective custody and brought a summons and complaint against Father for his alleged March 6, 2005, abuse of Child.Â  Despite allegedly being lifted off the ground and choked for two minutes, Child suffered no visible physical injuries.Â  As per both the Police and DSS and in contrast to Childâ€™s testimony, there was no bruising or other injuries found on Childâ€™s neck.Â  In fact, the only bruise appeared on Childâ€™s chest below his neck. \r\nOn Â September Â 19, Â 2005, Â Father Â was Â brought Â before Â the Â Richland County Family Court for a determination of physical abuse against Child.[2]Â  In an order filed November 16, 2005, the family court made a finding of abuse against Father regarding Child and further found Father posed a substantial risk of abuse to the two other children.Â  Father now appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  â€œWe are mindful that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.â€Â  Wynn v. Wynn, 360 S.C. 117, 123, 600 S.E.2d 71, 74 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFather contends the family court erred in finding he abused Child because the testimony supports his version of the events, and Father argues there is no evidence that he poses a substantial risk to his other children.Â  We agree. \r\nFather and Child were the only viable witnesses to the events of March 6, 2005, and they presented conflicting testimony.Â  Childâ€™s account of the events are somewhat incredible.Â  It is difficult to believe Father could have lifted Child off of the floor by his neck and held him in the air with his feet dangling for almost two minutes.Â  Further, the only Â physical evidence Â was Â a bruise â€œbelow [Childâ€™s] neckâ€ on his chest.Â  This evidence is inconsistent with Childâ€™s testimony and wholly consistent with Fatherâ€™s testimony that Â he put his hand on Childâ€™s chest and secured him against the wall.[3]  \r\nChild testified that he hated his father because of past problems between Father and Mother, and he wanted Father to be in prison for a long time.Â  Child further testified he wanted Mother back and Father gone, and that he knew if he told his school that father choked him that this would happen.[4]\r\nWhile we are mindful that the family court which saw and heard the witnesses was in a better position to evaluate their credibility, we find that the family court failed to assign credibility to either of the witnesses.Â  At the conclusion of the hearing, the family court stated â€œItâ€™s not so much that I believe or donâ€™t believe what was said here . . .â€Â  If the family court fails to assign credibility to witnessâ€™ testimony, then our deference to its superior position to adjudge the weight of the witnessâ€™ testimony is eliminated, and we must draw our own conclusions based on a preponderance of the evidence. \r\nWe find the preponderance of the evidence supports a finding that Father did not abuse Child.Â  Because we reverse the family courtâ€™s finding of abuse against Child, we also reverse the family courtâ€™s finding that Father poses a substantial risk of abuse to his other two children.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the family courtâ€™s order is\r\n REVERSED.\r\n GOOLSBY, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We note our appreciation for the able representation provided by appointed counsel.\r\n[2] At a Merits Hearing held prior to this matter, all parties reached an agreement with regards to custody and treatment.Â  The parties agreed custody of all three of the children would be returned to Angela G. (Mother), and that Angela and the children would begin counseling.Â  The only disputed item was the finding of abuse by Father.Â Â  \r\n[3] Section 20-7-490(2)(a) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) excludes from the definition of child abuse â€œcorporal punishment or physical discipline whichâ€ in pertinent part: â€œ(i) is administered by a parent . . . (ii) is perpetrated for the sole purpose of restraining or correcting the child (iii) is reasonable in manner and moderate in degree (iv) has not brought permanent or lasting damage to the child; and (v) is not reckless or grossly negligent behavior by the parents.â€ The actions which Father testified to would fall under this exception and would not constitute abuse.\r\n[4] Mother had left the home after a verbal disagreement with Father.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-407","title":"Richardson v.

Cliff Moore, III, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Marion Richardson filed this contract and tort action against Colliers Keenan, Inc. and Continental of South Carolina, Inc.Â  After a bench trial, the master in equity entered judgment for Colliers Keenan and Continental.Â  Richardson appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nRichardson and his brother, Robert Richardson, own a twenty-two acre tract of land in Richland County.Â  In 1998, the Riverland Hills Baptist Church approached the Richardsons about purchasing their tract, but ultimately concluded the tract was too small.Â  Therefore, the Richardsons attempted to purchase neighboring land from Continental and sell the combined tract to Riverland Hills.Â  \r\nContinental is a small corporation formed for the sole purpose of acquiring and eventually selling the Continental tract.Â  Colliers Keenan is a real estate agency.Â  On December 23, 1998, Tom Burch of Colliers Keenan, acting on behalf of the Richardsons, delivered a letter of intent to purchase the Continental tract to Dail Longaker, Jr.Â  Longaker is a real estate agent with Colliers Keenan and had previously listed property for Continental. Â In addition, Longakerâ€™s father owns twenty percent of Continentalâ€™s stock.Â  \r\nIn September 1999, Richardson, Longaker, and L.C. Howell, president and forty-percent shareholder of Continental, discussed the possibility of Richardson purchasing the Continental tract.Â  Richardson allegedly offered Howell $1.3 million for the Continental tract.Â  However, the parties did not execute a written contract, and the parties disagree on whether a final verbal agreement was reached.\r\nHowell, Longaker, and Richardson met again in early 2000.Â  Howell informed Richardson that with the proxy vote of another shareholder, he had fifty percent of the shares and believed he could obtain a controlling vote.Â  Longaker reiterated to Richardson that any sale would have to be affirmed by the majority of the shareholders.Â  \r\nContinental received the Richardson offer and another offer from East Lake Community Church.Â  On May 31, 2000, the Continental shareholders met to discuss and vote on the offers.Â  Longaker wrote a letter to the shareholders in preparation for the meeting.Â  In the letter, Longaker outlined the two offers and then stated, â€œStrictly from a financial perspective, the sale to East Lake Community Church should be the option to pursue.â€Â  At the meeting, the shareholders voted to pursue the East Lake offer.Â  Howell abstained from the vote, offered his shares to the other shareholders, and resigned as president.Â  Dail Longaker, Sr., was elected the new president.Â  The sale to East Lake was not completed. Â \r\nRichardson filed this action for specific performance and damages, alleging negligence, interference with prospective business advantage and contractual relations, negligent misrepresentation, constructive fraud, breach accompanied by a fraudulent act, conspiracy, violation of the Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA), and professional negligence.Â  The action was referred by consent to the master for a final judgment.Â  Richardsonâ€™s cause of action for specific performance was dismissed by stipulation of the parties.Â  \r\nAfter a six day trial, the master entered judgment for Continental and Colliers Keenan finding no contract was formed between Continental and Richardson.Â  The master also found no causation to support the various tort actions.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal of an action at law tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the trial court will not be disturbed unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the trial courtâ€™s findings.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  â€œThis scope of review is equally applicable to the factual determinations of a master when, as in the present case, he enters final judgment.â€Â  Wigfall v. Fobbs, 295 S.C. 59, 61, 367 S.E.2d 156, 157 (1988). Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS[1]\r\nI.Â  Formation of Contract\r\nRichardson argues the master erred in finding Richardson and Continental did not form a contract.Â  We disagree.Â  The elements required for formation of a contract are an offer, acceptance, and valuable consideration. Â Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of S.C., 354 S.C. 397, 406, 581 S.E.2d 161, 166 (2003).Â  Furthermore, â€œthere must be a meeting of the minds between the parties with regard to all essential and material terms of the agreement.â€Â  Player v. Chandler, 299 S.C. 101, 105, 382 S.E.2d 891, 893 (1989) (emphasis in original).Â  In this case, Continental never accepted an offer from Richardson.Â  An offer could only be accepted by the majority of the shareholders.Â  Richardson knew that a majority of the shareholders had to vote to accept his offer.Â  Like the master, we find no contract was formed.Â  Rather, Richardson suffered merely the loss of an expectancy.Â  See Collins Music Co. v. Cook, 281 S.C. 580, 583-84, 316 S.E.2d 418, 420 (Ct. App. 1984) (allowing no recovery for mere loss of expectancy).Â  \r\nFurther, the Statute of Frauds prohibits the sale of land, absent some exceptions, â€œ[u]nless the agreement . . . be in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith or some person thereunto by him lawfully authorized.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 32-3-10(4) (1991).Â  In this case, there is no written contract and no applicable exception to the Statute of Frauds.Â  \r\nII.Â  Causation of Contract Rejection\r\nRichardson argues the master erred in failing to find actions of Colliers Keenan and Continental caused the shareholders to reject his offer.Â  We disagree.Â  Ordinarily, the question of proximate cause is one for the finder of fact.Â \r\nMcNair v. Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, 349, 499 S.E.2d 488, 497 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Where the evidence is susceptible of only one inference, however, it becomes a matter of law for the court.Â  Hurd v. Williamsburg County, 353 S.C. 596, 614, 579 S.E.2d 136, 145 (Ct. App. 2003), affâ€™d, 362 S.C. 421, 611 S.E.2d 488 (2005).Â  \r\nRichardson first asserts Colliers Keenanâ€™s failure to have him sign an agency disclosure form caused the failure of the contract. Â The purpose of the disclosure form is to inform a potential buyer or seller of the real estate agentâ€™s relationship to them and the agentâ€™s involvement in representing them in their transaction.Â  The purpose of the disclosure form was met in this case because Richardson knew of the relationship of Longaker, Jr. to Continental and knew of Longaker, Sr.â€™s ownership interest.Â  Furthermore, Richardson admitted Longaker, Jr. had been â€œrepresented to [him] as the agent of his client, Continental.â€Â  \r\nRichardson also asserts Longaker, Jr.â€™s letter advising against the Richardson offer caused the failure of the contract.Â  Richardson expresses the allegations against Colliers Keenan as a breach of duty owed him by Colliers Keenan via the acts of its agent, Longaker, Jr. Â Under the common law, no duty is owed to another unless the duty is created by contract, statute, relationship, status or other special circumstance.Â \r\nCarson v. Adgar, 326 S.C. 212, 217, 486 S.E.2d 3, 5 (1997).Â  We find no duty breached by Colliers Keenan through its agent Longaker.Â  First, Colliers Keenan did not represent Richardson in this transaction and all previous mutual transactions between Richardson and Colliers Keenan were concluded. Â Also, as previously stated, Richardson knew Longaker, Jr. was a Colliers Keenan agent and represented Continental.Â  \r\nWe find evidence to support the judgment.Â  Richardson knew his offer had to be approved by a majority of the shareholders.Â  The shareholders were aware of another, more lucrative, offer from East Lake. Â The failure of the contract formation is directly attributable to the shareholderâ€™s rejection of Richardsonâ€™s offer in favor of the East Lake offer.Â  The record supports a conclusion that neither the failure to execute the disclosure form nor Longaker, Jr.â€™s advisory letter caused the failure of the contract formation.Â  \r\nRichardson next asserts Continental caused the failure of the contract formation through the acts of its agent, Howell.Â  We disagree.Â  It is true that a misrepresentation made by an agent while acting within the scope of his agency is attributable to the principal.Â  West v. Service Life &amp; Health Ins. Co., 220 S.C. 198, 200, 66 S.E.2d 816, 817 (1951).Â  However, there is no evidence to support Richardsonâ€™s allegation of a misrepresentation.Â  Richardson admitted knowledge that a majority of the shareholders had to approve the offer and knowledge that Howell owned only forty percent of Continental.Â  Howellâ€™s statement that he believed he could get a majority to agree was mere puffing.Â  See Satcher v. Berry, 299 S.C. 381, 383, 385 S.E.2d 41, 42 (Ct. App. 1989) (finding sellerâ€™s â€˜puffingâ€™ does not ordinarily constitute misrepresentation).\r\nIII.Â  Additional Causes of Action\r\nRichardson finally contends the master failed to make findings on his negligence, civil conspiracy, interference with contract, professional negligence, Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA), and fraud-based causes of action.Â  We find no reversible error.Â  Although the master failed to make specific findings on these causes of action, the record supports judgment for the defendants on these causes of action as Richardson cannot prove damages caused by the defendants.Â  See J.T. Baggerly v. CSX Transp., Inc., 370 S.C. 362, ___, 635 S.E.2d 97, 101 (2006) (requiring injuries caused by the defendants to recover on an action for negligence); Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, __, 633 S.E.2d 505, 511 (2006) (requiring same for\r\ncivil conspiracy); Crandall Corp. v. Navistar Intâ€™l Transp. Corp., 302 S.C. 265, 266, 395 S.E.2d 179, 180 (1990) (requiring same for intentional interference with prospective contractual relations); Lowrance v. Swaffield, 123 S.C. 331, 333, 116 S.E. 278, 278 (1923) (requiring same for professional negligence action against real estate broker); Schnellmann v. Roettger, 368 S.C. 17, 23, 627 S.E.2d 742, 745-46 (Ct. App. 2006) (requiring same for recovery under the UTPA); Armstrong v. Collins, 366 S.C. 204, 218, 621 S.E.2d 368, 375 (Ct. App. 2005) (requiring same for fraud).\r\nRichardson alleged damages of lost profits from combining the Continental tract with the Richardson tract to sell as one tract.Â  The alleged damages arise from the failure of contract formation and, as previously discussed, represent a mere expectancy rather than actual damages. Â The master appropriately found no damages caused by the defendants.Â  The failure of the master to make specific findings on each of these causes of action does not constitute reversible error.Â  See Owners Ins. Co. v. Clayton, 364 S.C. 555, 563, 614 S.E.2d 611, 615 (2005) (stating error without prejudice does not warrant reversal).\r\nRichardson also argues the master erred in failing to make specific findings of fact on his negligent misrepresentation and fraudulent breach of contract causes of action.Â  We likewise find no reversible error as we find evidence to support the judgment.Â  \r\nNegligent misrepresentation requires a duty and a loss due to reliance.Â  See Schnellmann, 368 S.C. at 20-21, 627 S.E.2d at 744 (â€œTo state a claim for\r\nnegligent misrepresentation a plaintiff must show (1) the defendant made a false representation to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant had a pecuniary interest\r\nin making the statement; (3) the defendant owed a duty of care to communicate truthful information to the plaintiff; (4) the defendant breached that duty; (5) the plaintiff justifiably relied on the representation; and (6) the plaintiff suffered a pecuniary loss as a result of such reliance.â€).Â  The master found no duty owed to Richardson, and the evidence supports this finding.Â  \r\nBreach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act requires a contract.Â  See Armstrong, 366 S.C. at 223, 621 S.E.2d at 377 (â€œHaving a contract is a prerequisite to proving breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act.â€). Â As discussed, there is no contract in this case.Â  \r\nAccordingly, although the master did not specifically address all of Richardsonâ€™s causes of action, we find evidence in the record to support the judgment.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â Richardson itemizes thirty-two issues but consolidates these issues into three arguments.Â  We likewise consolidate the issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-408","title":"Schmidt v.

Mahoney, of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Jean L. Schmidt appeals from a circuit court order affirming the order of The South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (Appellate Panel), denying Schmidtâ€™s claim for back and neck injuries and awarding permanent partial disability for Schmidtâ€™s carpal tunnel syndrome claim.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nJean L. Schmidt, the fifty-six year old claimant, worked for employer and respondent Anderson Merchandisers as a sales merchandiser for nearly seven years, until May 11, 2001.Â  Schmidt was responsible for the inventory of the book departments and music departments in several Wal-Mart stores.Â  Her job duties consisted of unloading boxes of merchandise from a pallet onto a cart, then using the cart to take the boxes inside the store to be opened and shelved.Â  Schmidtâ€™s job thus entailed regularly moving boxes weighing between five and thirty-five pounds.Â  \r\nSchmidt filed two separate workerâ€™s compensation claims against Anderson Merchandisers: one for carpal tunnel syndrome and the other for neck and back injuries.Â  The record supplies an extensive medical history relevant to these injuries.\r\nSchmidt has a degenerative disc disease that has necessitated surgeries of the cervical and lumbar areas of her spine.Â  Schmidtâ€™s first back strain occurred in 1979, long before she started working for Anderson Merchandisers.Â  Schmidt testified that she had sporadic back problems until 1996, when she began noticing a worsening of her condition when she was required to do lifting.Â  Schmidt testified that the aggravation of her problems resulted in a July 1996 lower spine surgical procedure in Tennessee.Â  , She suffered a low back strain in an early 1997 work-related automobile accident, and a neck strain in another work-related accident in December of 1997. Â She was soon transferred to South Carolina, where she began treatment with a new spine doctor, Dr. Poletti, in November of 1998.Â  Later, on June 14, 1999, she fell at work and injured her lower back and left leg. Â Schmidt continued to have lower back problems, and in October of 1999, she underwent lumbar spine fusion surgery.Â  After this surgery, Dr. Poletti restricted Schmidt from lifting more than ten pounds, and required alternative sitting and standing.Â  Anderson Merchandisers accommodated these restrictions by providing trainees to assist her for several months.Â  \r\nSchmidt was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2000.Â  While undergoing a lumpectomy and chemotherapy treatments, she began having shoulder, arm and hand pain, which eventually made her unable to continue holding objects.Â  A neurologist diagnosed her with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome in early 2001.Â  Schmidt filed a workersâ€™ compensation claim based upon this condition after her health insurance claim was denied.Â  \r\nMeanwhile, Schmidt testified that in 2000 she began to experience pain in the cervical region of her spine. Â Dr. Poletti advised her to seek short or long-term disability, and suggested she limit her physical activities.Â  Despite this advice, Schmidt wished to continue working.Â  Dr. Poletti thus agreed to perform cervical spine fusion surgery.Â  Schmidt testified that she informed Anderson Merchandisers she would be out of work for six to eight weeks following the surgery.Â  She last worked on May 11, 2001, and underwent the spine fusion surgery on May 14, 2001.Â  On June 5, 2001, Schmidt underwent carpal tunnel surgery on her right arm, and on July 10, 2001, she underwent the same procedure on her left arm.Â  On July 16, 2001, Poletti advised her not to return to work, and Schmidt notified Anderson Merchandisers that she would not.Â  \r\nSchmidt applied and was accepted for social security disability as a result of the severe degenerative disc disease and the surgeries of her lumbar and spine.Â  She then underwent a second cervical fusion procedure in October of 2001.Â  Schmidtâ€™s carpal tunnel surgeon released her to full duty on August 28, 2001, and on November 15, 2001, reported that Schmidt had reached maximum medical improvement, with five percent permanent impairments to each of her arms.Â  \r\nAt the hearing before the single commissioner, Schmidt stated she was aware as far back as 1996 that the lifting she performed at work was harming her back.Â  She also admitted knowledge of Anderson Merchandisersâ€™ policy requiring her to notify Steve Cohen, the risk control manager, of any work-related injury.Â  Schmidt had numerous communications with Cohen regarding her health problems and regarding other job incidents, but never reported any work-related injury involving her back and/or neck to him.Â  \r\nSchmidt forwarded to Anderson Merchandisersâ€™ human resource department a letter from Dr. Poletti dated July 16, 2001.Â  The letter stated in pertinent part: â€œMs. Schmidt has pain in her neck and in her low back.Â  There was no specific mechanism of injury that would cause this.Â  Repetitive trauma could theoretically contribute to an aggravation of this, but overall spinal condition is such that it will disable her.â€Â Â Â  Steve Cohen testified that Dr. Polettiâ€™s letter was not sent to his department because nothing in it indicated a work-related claim.Â  He stated that the first notice his risk-management department received of Schmidtâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation claim involving her back was in July of 2002, when her claim was filed.Â  \r\nAt the hearing before the single commissioner, Anderson Merchandisers admitted the carpal tunnel claims, but specifically denied the neck and back injury claims.Â  For her carpal tunnel claim, Schmidt submitted a second amended Form 50 with a November 27, 2000, date of injury and a $633.07 weekly wage.Â  In his argument before the single commissioner, Schmidtâ€™s attorney stated: â€œWe contend that the Claimaintâ€™s average weekly wage and compensation rate for the 2000 accident is at a minimal average weekly wage of $633.07 and the compensation rate being $422.07.â€Â  \r\nThe single commissioner awarded permanent partial disability for the carpal tunnel claim and awarded the requested amount, but denied the claim for back and neck injuries. The commissioner gave two reasons for denying the back and neck claim: first, the commissioner found Schmidt did not satisfy her burden of proving compensable injury by accident or by repetitive trauma; and second, the commissioner found Schmidt did not give notice to Anderson Merchandisers of her neck and back injuries.Â  Schmidt appealed, arguing that the commissioner erred in finding her neck and back injuries were not work-related, that she had indeed provided proper notice of her back and neck injuries, and that the compensation rate awarded for her carpal tunnel injury was incorrect.Â  The Appellate Panel and circuit court affirmed the single commissionerâ€™s order.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions of the [Appellate Panel].Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  The findings of the Appellate Panel will not be set aside if the findings are supported by substantial evidence and are not controlled by legal error.Â  Gray v. Club Group, Ltd., 339 S.C. 173, 183, 528 S.E.2d 435, 440 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\nSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the administrative agency reached in order to justify its action.Â  Bass v. Isochem, 365 S.C. 454, 468, 617 S.E.2d 369, 376 (2005); Pratt v. Morris Roofing, Inc., 357 S.C. 619, 622, 594 S.E.2d 272, 274 (2004).Â  Where there is a conflict in the evidence, the findings of fact of the Appellate Panel are conclusive.Â  Glover v. Columbia Hosp. of Richland County, 236 S.C. 410, 114 S.E.2d 565, 569 (1960); Alexander v. Forklifts Unlimited, 365 S.C. 509, 514, 618 S.E.2d 307, 309 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  In an appeal from the Appellate Panel, the appellate court will not substitute its judgment for that of the Panel as to the weight of evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where the decision is affected by error of law.Â  White v. Medical Univ. of S.C., 355 S.C. 560, 564, 586 S.E.2d 157, 169 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  However, construction of a statute by an agency charged with its administration will be accorded the most respectful consideration and will not by overruled absent compelling reasons.Â  Glover by Cauthen v. Suitt Const. Co., 318 S.C. 465, 469, 458 S.E.2d 535, 537 (1995).Â  The burden is on appellants to prove the agencyâ€™s decision is unsupported by evidence.Â  Waters v. S.C. Land Res. Conservation Commâ€™n, 321 S.C. 219, 226, 467 S.E.2d 913, 917 (1996); Tennis v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 355 S.C. 551, 558, 585 S.E.2d 312, 316 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Causation\r\nSchmidt argues the Appellate Panel erred in finding there was no medical evidence to show a causal connection between Schmidtâ€™s back and neck problems and her work activities.Â  Specifically, she contends that the Appellate Panel relied on a legally erroneous assumption that medical testimony is required to show a causal-connection, and that absent such medical testimony, there can be no finding of causation.Â  Further, she argues the finding of no medical evidence establishing causation is not supported by substantial evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nSchmidtâ€™s first argument has no merit.Â  An objective reading of the Appellate Panelâ€™s straightforward finding that â€œthere is no medical evidence in the record that indicates a causal connection between the Claimantâ€™s back and neck problems and her work activitiesâ€ provides no implication of a legal requirement of medical evidence.Â  Review of the record, of the circuit courtâ€™s order, and of the Appellate Panelâ€™s order reveals that all findings were based on consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case as a whole, including the medical evidence and the testimony of both Schmidt and Steve Cohen.\r\nSchmidtâ€™s argument that the Appellate Panelâ€™s finding was not supported by substantial evidence in the record is also unpersuasive.Â  Throughout Schmidtâ€™s years of treatment to her neck and back, no treating physician has ever indicated that Schmidtâ€™s work at Anderson Merchandisers aggravated or worsened a previous condition.Â  The only medical testimony Schmidt relies upon to link her neck and back injuries to her work is found in Dr. Polettiâ€™s letter, which states:Â  â€œThere is no specific mechanism of injury that would cause this. Repetitive trauma could theoretically contribute to an aggravation of this but her overall spinal condition is such that it will disable her.â€Â  Schmidt contends that these statements constituted a â€œcautious opinion that [Schmidtâ€™s] work was contributing to an aggravation of her pre-existing spine condition.â€Â  However Polettiâ€™s letter clearly avoids advancing an opinion of causation by merely stating â€œ[r]epetitive trauma could theoretically contribute to an aggravation.â€ (emphasis added).Â  Further, Poletti never opines that Schmidtâ€™s work regimen entailed such â€œrepetitive trauma.â€ This less presumptuous reading of the letter is buttressed by consideration of the two subsequent letters Dr. Poletti wrote on behalf of Schmidt to the Social Security Administration in which again he mentioned her various problems without ever relating them to her employment.\r\nTherefore, we find there is substantial evidence on the record to support the Appellate Panelâ€™s finding that Schmidtâ€™s back injuries were not caused by her work at Anderson Merchandisers.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Compensation Rate\r\nSchmidt next argues the Appellate Panel erred in the amount it awarded in compensation for her carpal tunnel claim.Â  Schmidt contends that the Appellate Panel should not have calculated her compensation rate based on the November 27, 2000, date of injury she submitted.Â  Rather, Schmidt suggests the calculation should be based on the average weekly wage for the fifty-two weeks prior to her last day of work on May 11, 2001.Â  On appeal, the circuit court held this issue was not preserved.Â  We agree.\r\nWe note that it was Schmidt who provided the November 27, 2000 date of injury, the $633.07 average weekly wage, and the $422.07 compensation rate on her filings. Â Furthermore, Schmidt specifically requested the same compensation rate before the single commissioner at the hearing, and conceded the average weekly wage amount from which it was derived.Â  Because Schmidt received the compensation she requested, and conceded the average weekly wage amount from which it is derived, this issue is not preserved for appeal.Â  See TNS Mills, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 617, 503 S.E.2d 471, 474 (1998)(â€œAn issue conceded in a lower court may not be argued on appeal.â€); Erickson v. Jones Street Publishers, LLC, 368 S.C. 444, 476, 629 S.E.2d 653, 670 (2006)(A party may not complain on appeal of error or object to a trial procedure which his own conduct has induced); and Harrison v. Bevilacqua, 354 S.C. 129, 139, 580 S.C. 109, 115 (2003)(Petitioner cannot now complain the trial court erred when it took her own suggestion).Â  Therefore, we affirm the circuit courtâ€™s compensation award of $422.07 per week. \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nBased on the foregoing, the decision of the circuit court is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.[2]\r\nHEARN, C.J., and STILWELL and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] In light of our disposition of Schmidtâ€™s back and neck claim based on the causation issue, we need not address Schmidtâ€™s arguments relating to notice.Â  See Whiteside v.

Henderson, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-409\r\nSubmitted December 1, 2006 â€“ Filed December 13, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nSamuel R. Chandler, Jr., of Lancaster, for Appellant.\r\nAngela M. Killian, of Lancaster, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â This is an appeal from the termination of Charmaine Hâ€™s[1] (Motherâ€™s) parental rights with respect to her infant daughter (Child).Â  Mother argues the family court erred in failing to place Child with Angelia M., the childâ€™s maternal grandmother (Grandmother).[2]Â  We affirm.[3]\r\nFACTS\r\nMother gave birth to Child on February 27, 2005.Â  Because both Mother and Child tested positive for cocaine at the time, South Carolina Department of Social Services (the Department) removed Child from Motherâ€™s custody on March 1, 2005.Â  Mother admitted using cocaine the day before giving birth to Child.Â  On March 4, the family court held a probable cause hearing and determined probable cause existed for the Department to take emergency custody of Child.Â  Subsequently, the family court held a merits and permanency planning hearing.Â  On April 1, the family court approved the Departmentâ€™s plan of â€œtermination of parental rights and adoption concurrent with plans for custody to a suitable, fit and willing relative.â€[4]Â  \r\nOn November 1, the family court held a termination of parental rights (TPR) hearing.Â  Initially, the Department interpreted the April 1 order as one in which the judge ordered TPR and adoption, but â€œin the event that T.P.R. and adoption falls through,â€ the concurrent plan would be placement with a fit and willing relative.Â  Mother objected to this characterization of the April 1 order, arguing it called for a hearing to determine whether TPR and adoption or placement with a fit and willing relative would be in the best interests of Child. Â \r\nThe Department presented evidence that Mother had used cocaine and crack cocaine for eleven years; failed to complete the treatment plan recommended by the Department with regard to the removal of two other children the year prior to Childâ€™s birth, including failing to participate in the outpatient drug treatment plan; tested positive in an exit drug screen from the inpatient drug treatment plan; and suffered from psychotic disorder, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and polysubstance dependence on cocaine, alcohol, and marijuana.Â  The Department presented evidence that Motherâ€™s condition was unlikely to change in the future.Â Â  \r\nEvidence was also presented regarding whether Grandmother, who was caring for two of Motherâ€™s other children, would be a fit and willing custodian.Â  Because Grandmother lived in North Carolina, the Department submitted a home study conducted by the Union County, North Carolina, Department of Social Services (Union County). Â Although Union County characterized the home study as favorable, the Department had several concerns.Â  The Department noted: (1) the household would be crowded, with Grandmother, her husband, her adult son, and two of Motherâ€™s other children already residing in the home; (2) Grandmotherâ€™s husband (Husband) initially opposed the custodianship; (3) Husband had a drinking problem that caused Grandmother and the other children in the house to leave on occasion; (4) Grandmother was unemployed; (5) the household income did not appear to be enough to support the whole family; and (6) a previous home study on Grandmother had been unfavorable. \r\nOn cross-examination, Motherâ€™s counsel showed Husband agreed to the custodianship and only had one drinking-related offense, a twelve-year-old DUI.Â  Moreover, the home study indicated Child would have her own bed and closet space in Grandmotherâ€™s custody.Â  Additionally, the prior home study had been unfavorable due to Motherâ€™s failure to submit a required verification and Husbandâ€™s refusal to allow more children to live in the home.Â  Both of these problems had been cured at the time of the second home study.Â  Furthermore, the more recent home study noted that Motherâ€™s two other children residing with Grandmother were well-adjusted and respectful.Â  One of the children received an academic scholarship to college while still in middle school.Â  Further, Grandmother had prior experience working with young children as a former teacher in the HeadStart program.Â  \r\nOn November 21, the family court issued an order terminating Motherâ€™s parental rights, finding that Mother had abused cocaine and crack cocaine for eleven years, rendering her unlikely to provide minimally acceptable care for Child, and that it was in Childâ€™s best interest for Motherâ€™s rights to be terminated.Â  The court also considered Motherâ€™s request to give custody to Grandmother.Â  The court reviewed the evidence presented for and against granting custody to Grandmother and determined Childâ€™s best interests would be served by terminating Motherâ€™s parental rights and preparing Child for adoption.Â  However, the court held â€œshould [Grandmother] qualify for adoption of the child, preference should be given to [Grandmother] since she is a blood relative.â€Â Â  \r\nPursuant to Ex Parte Cauthen, 291 S.C. 465, 354 S.E.2d 381 (1987), Motherâ€™s counsel attached a petition to be relieved stating he reviewed the record and found no issues meriting appeal.Â  Mother did not file a pro se brief.Â  This court conducted its review in accord with Cauthen and ordered the parties to brief the following issue:\r\n\r\nWhether the family court erred in denying Motherâ€™s request that Grandmother be granted custody of Child?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nGenerally, â€œ[i]n appeals from the family court, the appellate court has the authority to find the facts in accordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Ex parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 61, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652 (2006).Â  This is also true in termination of parental rights cases.Â \r\nCharleston County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Jackson, 368 S.C. 87, 95, 627 S.E.2d 765, 770 (Ct. App. 2006) (holding that in an appeal from the termination of parental rights, an appellate court may review the record and make its own determination whether the grounds for termination are supported by clear and convincing evidence).Â  Despite this broad scope of review, however, the appellate court should not necessarily disregard the findings of the family court because the family court is in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and assign weight to their testimony.Â  Id.Â  â€œThis degree of deference is especially true in cases involving the welfare and best interests of a minor child.â€Â \r\nEx parte Morris, at 62, 624 S.E.2d at 652.\r\nâ€œCustody decisions are matters left largely to the discretion of the family courtâ€.Â  Shirley v. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324, 330, 536 S.E.2d 427, 430 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œFurthermore, the appellate court should be reluctant to substitute its own evaluation of the evidence on child custody for that of the family court.â€Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMother contends the family court erred by failing to place Child with Grandmother.[5]Â  She argues that, pursuant to the permanency planning statute, the family court should have given â€œcompelling reasonsâ€ for failing to place Child with Grandmother.Â  We disagree.Â \r\nAs with all custody determinations, the best interest of the child is paramount in termination of parental rights cases.Â  Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App. 2003) (â€œIn a termination of parental rights . . . case, the best interests of the children are the paramount consideration.â€). Â The purpose of the termination of parental rights statute is â€œto establish procedures for the reasonable and compassionate termination of parental rights where children are abused, neglected, or abandoned . . .â€ in order to protect children and to make them eligible for adoption by â€œpersons who will provide a suitable home environment and the love and care necessary for a happy, healthful, and productive life.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1560 (Supp. 2005).\r\nIn the permanency planning stage prior to termination of parental rights, the Department may recommend several alternatives for placement of the child, including custody with a fit and willing relative.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-766(A) (Supp. 2005).Â  Mother relies heavily on section 20-7-766(C), which provides:\r\n\r\nAt the permanency planning hearing, the court shall review the departmentâ€™s plan for achieving permanence for the child.Â  If the departmentâ€™s plan is not reunification with the parents, custody or guardianship with a fit and willing relative, or termination of parental rights, the department must show compelling reasons for the selection of another permanent plan.Â  If the court approves a plan that is not reunification with the parents, custody with a fit and willing relative, or termination of parental rights, the court must find compelling reasons for approval of the plan and that the plan is in the childâ€™s best interests.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-766(C) (Supp. 2005) (emphasis added).Â  Further, our Supreme Court, in dicta, has interpreted section 20-7-766(G): Â â€œ[The] family court at the permanency planning stage for a child removed from his home may award custody or legal guardianship to a â€˜suitable, fit, and willing relative or nonrelative.â€™â€Â  Ex parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 63, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652 (2006) (interpreting section 20-7-766(G) in a parenthetical to show the Legislature contemplates non-relatives may play an important role in a childâ€™s life).\r\nMother argues the family court erred by failing to place Child with Grandmother because, as a â€œfit and willing relative,â€ the court has to give compelling reasons to place Child someplace else.Â  Mother has misapprehended the permanency planning statute.Â  Although the General Assembly has provided that fit and willing relatives should be considered, the statute provides that the family court must only give â€œcompelling reasonsâ€ when it approves a plan that is something other than â€œreunification with the parents, custody or guardianship with a fit and willing relative, or termination of parental rights.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-766(C) (Supp. 2005).Â  Because the court approved of termination of Motherâ€™s parental rights, one of the options in the statute, the court did not err by failing to give â€œcompelling reasonsâ€ for failing to place Child with Grandmother.Â  Further, section 20-7-766 does not address whether the Department or the family court must consider placement with a fit and willing relative before or after TPR.[6]Â  Â Â \r\nMoreover, the family courtâ€™s order does not preclude Grandmother from adopting Child.Â  The family court anticipated Grandmotherâ€™s involvement in Childâ€™s adoption proceedings.Â  Although the family court did not expressly rule on whether Grandmother was a â€œfit and willing relative,â€ the court ordered the Department to give preference to Grandmother in the event she is found fit and willing.Â Â  \r\nAlthough the family court approved of a permanent plan for termination of parental rights concurrent with placement with a fit and willing relative, we find the family court did not err in terminating Motherâ€™s parental rights.Â  Under these circumstances, we hold Childâ€™s best interests would be served by allowing the Department to complete its investigation of Grandmotherâ€™s status as a fit and willing relative of Child.Â  See Joiner v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 107, 536 S.E.2d 372, 374 (2000) (affirming the Court of Appealsâ€™ finding that â€œprocedural rules are subservient to the courtâ€™s\r\nduty to zealously guard the rights of minorsâ€); Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. at 579, 578 S.E.2d at 735 (holding the best interests of the child is paramount in termination of parental rights cases); Ex parte Dibble, 279 S.C. 592, 595, 310 S.E.2d 440, 442 (Ct. App. 1983) (â€œCourts\r\nhave the inherent power to do all things reasonably necessary\r\nto insure that just results are reached to the fullest extent possible.â€).Â  This procedure allows Grandmother to assert any rights she claims as a relative of Child.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe family court properly terminated the parental rights of Mother.Â  In doing so, the court denied placement of Child with Grandmother.Â  However, the court did not foreclose the possibility of Grandmother adopting Child.Â  Because the court considered Childâ€™s best interest in its ruling, the family courtâ€™s order is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n HEARN, C.J., BEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] In order to protect the identities of the parties, we refer to them only by their first names and the last initial.\r\n[2] Childâ€™s father is unknown.Â  The unknown father was served by publication, and the family court terminated his parental rights.Â  He is not a party to this appeal.\r\n[3] Â Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[4] This order is not included in the record.Â  However, both the attorney for Mother and the family court paraphrased the April 1 order in almost identical language.Â  \r\n[5]Â  Mother does not challenge the family courtâ€™s decision to terminate her parental rights, and the record clearly supports the family courtâ€™s decision.Â  As Mother does not appeal the termination of her parental rights, it is the law of the case.Â \r\nSouth Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Seegars, 367 S.C. 623, 628 n.3, 627 S.E.2d 718, 721 n.3 (2006) (holding that failure to appeal a family court ruling renders it the law of the case).\r\n[6] In addition, we note Grandmother has not been made a party to the family courtâ€™s proceedings.Â  Furthermore, we express our concern that Mother may not have standing to assert Grandmotherâ€™s rights to receive custody of Child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-410","title":"State v.

Ariail, of Greenville; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Appellant, Travis Whitmire, was indicted and tried for first-degree burglary, conspiracy, and three counts of armed robbery.Â  Whitmire was convicted of the conspiracy and burglary charges, as well as two of the armed robbery charges, and the trial court sentenced him to concurrent sentences of twenty-five years on the burglary and armed robbery convictions, and five years for conspiracy. Whitmire appeals, asserting the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn the night of November 8, 2001, Corey Bagwell and his girlfriend Kami Johnson were in their bedroom in the trailer they shared with Coreyâ€™s brother, Jonathan.Â  Around 10:00 p.m., Corey was falling asleep and Kami was watching television when a black male with a rifle quickly pushed open their bedroom door.Â  This man alerted another that there was â€œsomebody else in here,â€ and a second black male entered the room with a pistol grip shotgun.Â  The two men told Corey to give them all his money.Â  When Corey reached for his wallet one of the men hit him in the head with a gun.Â  Corey gave them his wallet, which contained approximately $50.Â  The two men grabbed a DVD player and began â€œtearing [the bedroom] apart,â€ pulling things out of a closet, a trunk and some drawers.Â  The men were â€œyelling for more money,â€ and Corey told them to look in his entertainment center, where there was $2,800 in cash. Â The $2,800 was money borrowed for the purpose of Kamiâ€™s school tuition.Â  During this ordeal, Corey could hear someone else yelling like the two men in his room had been, and he assumed it was someone talking to his brother, Jonathan.Â  \r\nAfter the men finished ransacking the bedroom and collecting the money, they made Corey and Kami crawl on their hands and knees into the living room.Â  Once in the living room, Corey saw his brother, as well as his brotherâ€™s friend who was being dragged across the floor by another male.Â  The intruders screamed â€œthat it wasnâ€™t a game,â€ and two of the men ran out while the third man with the pistol grip shotgun made the victims crawl into the kitchen.Â  The third man stood on the back porch waiting for a car.Â  When Corey heard tires squealing, he looked up to make sure they were gone and went next door to check on his parents.Â  Corey stated he had never seen the three men that came into his home before that night.Â  When he and Kami were driven to a location by officers to view some suspects, both told the officers that the two men at the location were two of the men that had robbed them that night.Â  They later learned that one of the men was not ultimately charged in the case.Â  \r\nJonathan testified that on the night of November 8, 2001, his friend Ray Godfrey was visiting him at his home.Â  An acquaintance of his, Amber Nalley, called and indicated she and a friend wanted to come over to his home.Â  Jonathan had never met Amberâ€™s friend, but had spoken to her on the phone that night.Â  When the girls arrived, they walked back to Jonathanâ€™s bedroom where Ray was.Â  They planned to watch a movie and â€œchill with the girls.â€Â  At some point, both girls left the room to go to the bathroom.Â  Jonathan thought the two would come walking back into the bedroom, but instead a man appeared with a shotgun.Â  The man asked where a key was to a filing cabinet and demanded money. Â Another man appeared and began ripping things off of Jonathanâ€™s entertainment center, and going through his jewelry and closet.Â  Jonathan saw two guns, a long one and a short pistol grip.Â  The second man did not stay in his room very long, but left and went through the house to another room.Â  The men were asking Jonathan for money and when he did not respond quickly, one of them hit Jonathan in the back of the head with the longer shotgun.Â  Jonathan stated he blacked out after he was hit, and when he came to, he and Ray were instructed to go toward the kitchen.Â  Ray was being kicked and drug across the floor into the other room while Jonathan was forced to crawl in there on his hands and knees.Â  He was on one side of the bar in the kitchen when he saw Corey and Kami brought out there and placed on the other side of the bar.Â  The intruders took Jonathanâ€™s watches and some money, including $160 from his filing cabinet and between $50 and $70 from his pocket.Â  They also took some money and some drugs from Ray.Â  Jonathan stated he had never seen any of these men before that night.Â  After the intruders left, Jonathan called the police.Â  When they arrived, he gave them Amber Nalleyâ€™s name and told them where she lived.Â  \r\nOfficers Ridgeway and Weiner with the Greenville County Sheriffâ€™s Office received information over their radios concerning Amber Nalley as a suspect in this matter.Â  Officer Weiner knew Amber from previous dealings and knew where she lived.Â  The two officers therefore responded to the location of Amberâ€™s address.Â  As Officer Weiner spoke to Amberâ€™s grandmother in the home, Officer Ridgeway remained on the street.Â  While standing near his vehicle, Officer Ridgeway observed a car matching the description of the suspectsâ€™ vehicle about a block away.Â  The car stopped, turned, and went up a street.Â  The officer noticed the car was traveling at a low rate of speed and without any lights.Â  He then saw it being driven at a high rate of speed at which time Officer Ridgeway pursued the vehicle until it eventually stopped in a driveway.Â  Officer Ridgeway observed two females in the front seat, and two black males in the back seat.Â  The males were shoving the seats onto the females, attempting to get out of the car.Â  When the males did finally exit the car, they ran off in different directions.Â  The two females in the car were Lauren Revelle and Amber Nalley.Â  Amber and Lauren were arrested and transported to the law enforcement center.Â  The two males, who were caught a short time later in the area, were Frederick Harris (Fred) and Shamar Harris.Â  At the time of his apprehension, Fred had $457.26 in his possession. Â Officers also recovered Jonathanâ€™s two watches in the area where Fred was hiding.Â  Fred was arrested in regard to this matter.Â  Shamar was also arrested, but his arrest was based on a warrant unrelated to this matter.Â  \r\nBased on statements made by Lauren and Amber, the officers executed a search warrant at the home of Fred.Â  There they recovered a pistol grip shotgun and a long rifle shotgun that Corey testified looked like the guns he observed in the home invasion.Â  Officers also searched room 106 at the best Way Motel after receiving consent from Lauren Revelle.Â  There they collected a handwritten note with a message in parentheses in the top corner of â€œIâ€™m getting some cardsâ€ and the following main notation on that side:Â  â€œFred, call me at the house.Â  I called a cab to take the yamean to the house.Â  I left at 11:10 p.m., me and Mark together.Â  Call me, man, I want to come back.â€Â  The reverse side of the note stated, â€œI will be back, went home.â€Â  An expert in the area of handwriting analysis determined appellant had written the front side of the note referring to calling a cab to take the â€œyameanâ€ to the house.Â  She concluded the reverse side of the note was written by someone named Mark Johnson.Â  \r\nLauren Revelle testified on behalf of the State.Â  She stated that at the time of the incident, Fred was her boyfriend. Â She had never met Amber Nalley prior to that day, but did know Mark Johnson and appellant through Fred.Â  The afternoon of the robbery, she received a call from appellant and Mark.Â  The three of them then picked up Amber, who showed them how to get to the targeted house.Â  At that time, no one had any guns with them.Â  From that location, they drove to Amberâ€™s house and dropped her off.Â  Appellant, Mark and Lauren then went to appellantâ€™s apartment, where appellant called Fred and told him they had seen the house and that Amber had recommended the robbery take place that evening.Â  After running some errands, they went back to appellantâ€™s apartment and waited for Fred to call.Â  Appellant eventually called Fred, at which time they decided to meet at a Hardeeâ€™s.Â  From there, Lauren, Fred, Mark and appellant went to Fredâ€™s apartment.Â  Fred and Mark came out with two bags with guns in them.Â  From there, the four went to the targeted location.Â  They had planned for Lauren to drop the three men off and wait on them while they robbed the people inside.Â  Fred, Mark and appellant exited the car with the guns, but came back to the car about two minutes later because they did not have a means of getting into the house and they were concerned about some dogs.Â  They drove to a gas station where Fred called Amber, and then subsequently drove to Amberâ€™s house where Mark, Fred, Amber and appellant discussed a new plan.Â  Amber was to arrange a visit to the house on the pretense of buying drugs and then let the others into the house.Â  \r\nAmber stated she called Jonathan as planned and Jonathan said they could come over and â€œdo some stuff for free.â€Â  They all then went over to the location, where Lauren and Amber dropped Fred, Mark and appellant off with the guns about one hundred feet from the house.Â  The plan was for Mark to â€œget the stuffâ€ and appellant and Fred to have the guns.Â  Amber and Lauren were let into the house and went back to the bedroom where they watched TV and talked to Jonathan and his friend.Â  Amber and Lauren left the room to go to the bathroom.Â  At that time, Lauren signaled Fred, Mark and appellant by opening the blinds on the door.Â  Within a minute, the door opened and Fred, Mark and appellant came into the house.Â  The bedroom door opened and Lauren heard yelling and saw guns being pointed.Â  She testified it was Fred and appellant who had gone into the bedroom.Â  The intruding men were loud and mean, demanding things and cussing.Â  Lauren and Amber ran out to the car and drove a little bit up the road.Â  Fred, Mark and appellant came back to the car with the guns, a DVD player, bags of jewelry, drugs and money.Â  The five then went to Best Way Motel, where Lauren got them a room, and they counted up the money and split everything three ways. Â Lauren, Fred and Amber left Mark and appellant at the hotel because Fred wanted to take the guns back to the apartment and Amber wanted to get her things from her house.Â  They planned to meet Mark and appellant back at the hotel.Â  The three went to Fredâ€™s apartment, where Fred took the guns inside and brought his cousin, Shamar Harris, back out with him.Â  They headed to Amberâ€™s house, where they saw the police cars and attempted to avoid them.Â  When they subsequently stopped, Fred and Shamar ran from the car and Lauren and Amber were arrested.Â  \r\nAmber testified she signed a release for them to search the hotel room.Â  She stated the word â€œyameanâ€ on the note found in the hotel room was slang for â€œyou know what I meanâ€ and referred to â€œthe stuff.â€Â  In exchange for her cooperation, Lauren was offered a plea bargain where the State would recommend probation for her.Â  She pled guilty to conspiracy and received a probationary sentence.Â  \r\nAfter the State rested, appellant moved for a directed verdict as to the robbery of Kami asserting there was â€œno theft of her propertyâ€ since the money taken was obtained by Corey.Â  He further asserted he was entitled to â€œa directed verdict on the entire caseâ€ because the State did not â€œhave enough to move forward.â€Â  The trial court denied both motions.Â  Following their presentation of alibi evidence, the defense rested and renewed its previous motions, which the trial court denied.Â  The jury found appellant guilty of conspiracy, burglary in the first degree, and two counts of armed robbery involving Corey and Jonathan.Â  Appellant was acquitted of armed robbery of Kami.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, appellant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion for directed verdict because â€œno probative evidence placed appellant at the scene of the crime.â€Â  He argues the only evidence placing him at the scene was the â€œwholly unreliable testimony of Lauren Revelle,â€ who received a reduced sentence in exchange for her testimony. He maintains Laurenâ€™s testimony was â€œextortedâ€ by the Stateâ€™s promises and it should not qualify as substantial probative evidence, particularly in light of the facts that the victims identified another man and there was no physical evidence to implicate him.Â  \r\nIt is questionable whether appellant has preserved this argument for our review.Â  Although he did generally argue the evidence was insufficient in his directed verdict motion, he never argued below, as he does now, that the evidence was insufficient because there was no probative evidence of his presence at the scene of the crime.Â  See State v. Freiburger, 366 S.C. 125, 135, 620 S.E.2d 737, 742 (2005) (â€œThe rule is well established that if asserted errors are not presented to the lower Court, the question cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.â€);Â  State v. Johnson, 363 S.C. 53, 58-59, 609 S.E.2d 520, 523 (2005) (an objection should be addressed to the trial court in a sufficiently specific manner that brings attention to the exact error and if Â a party fails to properly object, the party is procedurally barred from raising the issue on appeal);Â  State v. Curtis, 356 S.C. 622, 634, 591 S.E.2d 600, 606 (2004) (appellant, who argued at trial only that he was entitled to a directed verdict on the basis that he was not directly involved in the sale of urine kits and that there was no evidence the individual who purchased his urine kits had any intent to defraud a drug test, failed to preserve for appellate review his claim on appeal that he was entitled to a directed verdict on the ground there was no evidence the kits were sold with the intent to defraud);Â  State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 120-21, 481 S.E.2d 118, 123 (1997)Â  (â€œAn issue may not be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€)Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nEven if this general objection is deemed sufficient to preserve the specific grounds now argued on appeal, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s denial of the motion.Â  In ruling on a motion for directed verdict in a criminal case, a trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the\r\nState. Â State v. Wakefield, 323 S.C. 189, 196, 473 S.E.2d 831, 835 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.\r\nÂ State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 555, 564 S.E.2d 87, 92 (2002). â€œA defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the\r\nState fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.â€ Â State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 97, 544 S.E.2d 30, 36 (2001).Â  Furthermore, the trial court should not refuse to grant the directed verdict motion when the evidence merely raises a suspicion that the accused is guilty.\r\nÂ State v. Mitchell, 341 S.C. 406, 409, 535 S.E.2d 126, 127 (2000).\r\nWhen reviewing a denial of a directed verdict, this court, as well, must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the\r\nState. State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006).Â  If there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, we must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.\r\nÂ State v. McCombs, 368 S.C. 489, 493, 629 S.E.2d 361, 363 (2006).Â  \r\nHere, the State presented sufficient evidence of appellantâ€™s participation in the crimes to support the trial courtâ€™s denial of the directed verdict motion.Â  Lauren testified appellant participated in the planning of the crime, and was one of the three men who entered the home with guns that evening.Â  She specifically pointed appellant out as having entered Jonathanâ€™s bedroom, demanding things and cussing in a loud manner. Â The fact that appellant asserts Laurenâ€™s testimony should not be believed is not a basis for a directed verdict.Â  Instead, appellantsâ€™ argument creates a credibility issue to be resolved by the jury.Â  See State v. Ham, 268 S.C. 340, 342, 233 S.E.2d 698, 698 (1997) (â€œWhere the determination of guilt is dependant upon the credibility of the witnesses, a motion for a directed verdict is properly refused.â€) Â Additionally, the testimony from the victims corroborates that three men were involved in the home invasion, along with Lauren and Amber.Â  Laurenâ€™s testimony also explains how Shamar, who was not arrested in this matter, came to be with her, Amber and Fred when they were stopped by the police, and Mark and appellant were not. Â Finally, appellantâ€™s presence at the hotel room, which Lauren indicated she registered for after the home invasion, was corroborated through testimony from the handwriting expert linking the note found in the room that night to appellant. \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, appellantâ€™s convictions are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-411","title":"SCDSS v.

Blanton, of Columbia; for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Marion L. Eadon appeals the jury award of $5,000 for breach of contract, $5,000 for breach of implied warranty, $3,000,000 for negligence, and $3,500,000 in punitive damages to Samuel W. Rhodes, Jr.Â  Eadon argues the trial court erred in (1) denying his motion to transfer venue; (2) allowing a verdict against him as an individual; (3) excluding evidence; (4) allowing a punitive damages award; and (5) denying his post-trial motions for a new trial absolute, or, in the alternative, a new trial nisi remittitur.Â  We reverse and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn September 1998, Eadon formed C&amp;B Fabricators, Inc., a statutory close corporation.Â  C&amp;B Fabricatorsâ€™ principal business was manufacturing and erecting outdoor signs.Â  Eadon hired Chuck Benenhaley to be manager of the company.Â  \r\nSometime in 1999, Rhodes, representing Piedmont Promotions, Inc. (Piedmont),[1] contacted Eadon and Benenhaley about building and erecting three outdoor advertising signs on property in Fairfield County.Â  Rhodes received a proposal from â€œC&amp;B Fabricationâ€ for the fabrication, building, and installation of the three signs.Â  Rhodes accepted the proposal in August 1999.Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) had issued Piedmont permits to construct and maintain the three outdoor advertising signs upon the property in Fairfield County.[2]Â  Piedmont represented to SCDOT that the property would be the future sight of a car business, Interstate Auto Sales (Interstate), owned by Rhodesâ€™ wife. Â The property was located within an unzoned commercial or industrial area.[3]Â  \r\nSubsequently, three signs were built and erected. Â Rhodes tendered full payment, in three installments, for the signs.Â  Payment was made by check from Piedmont Promotions.Â  The first payment was made to â€œC&amp;B Fabrication;â€ the other payments were made to â€œC&amp;B Fabricators.â€Â  \r\nIn December 2000, Rhodes noticed his middle sign was leaning.Â  Rhodes called Eadon several times about fixing the sign. Â Rhodes also faxed Eadon about the sign; the faxes were addressed to â€œMr. Marion Eadon, C&amp;B Fabricators.â€Â  Eadon informed Rhodes â€œC&amp;B Fabricationâ€ went out of business.Â  Nevertheless, Eadon sent a crew to fix the sign.Â  A few days later, a different sign fell onto I-77.Â  \r\nSCDOT deemed all three signs unsafe and ordered Rhodes to remove the signs.Â  Thereafter, SCDOT cancelled Rhodesâ€™s billboard permits because the signs were â€œunsafe and present a hazard to the motoring public.â€Â  Rhodes submitted an application for new permits which SCDOT denied finding that Interstate was not a qualifying commercial business, but was being operated as a sham.[4]Â  Rhodes appealed to the Administrative Law Judge. Â The ALJ affirmed SCDOTâ€™s decision holding Rhodesâ€™s business was a sham activity,[5] not a commercial activity, and therefore the refusal to grant permits for re-erection of the outdoor signs was justified. \r\nIn December 2001, Rhodes and Piedmont filed an action against Eadon, d/b/a C&amp;B Fabrication, in Fairfield County.Â  The complaint alleged causes of action for breach of contract, breach of warranty, strict liability, fraudulent breach of contract, fraud, constructive fraud, negligent misrepresentation, negligence, bad faith, nuisance, and violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act.Â  \r\nEadon filed a motion to transfer venue to Clarendon County, the county of his residence.Â  The trial court denied the motion pursuant to section 15-7-10 of the South Carolina Code (2005).Â  Specifically, the trial court held the action arises out of â€œinjuries to real propertyâ€ and â€œmust be tried in the county in which the subject of the action or some part thereof is situated.â€Â  \r\nA jury trial was held in Fairfield County.Â  At the trialâ€™s conclusion, the only causes of action submitted to the jury were for breach of contract, breach of warranty, and negligence.Â  The jury returned a verdict of $5,000 for breach of contract; $5,000 in actual damages for breach of an implied warranty; and $3,000,000 in actual damages for negligence, and $3,500,000 in punitive damages.Â  \r\nEadon filed post-trial motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), a new trial, a new trial nisi remittitur, and a post-trial review of the punitive damages award.Â  After hearing arguments, the trial court denied all of Eadonâ€™s post-trial motions.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nEadon argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to transfer venue.Â  We agree.\r\nMotions to change the venue of a trial are addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Garrett v. Packet Motor Express Co., 263 S.C. 463, 465, 210 S.E.2d 912, 912 (1975).Â  The trial courtâ€™s ruling will not be disturbed unless it appears a manifest legal error was committed.Â  Turner v. Santee Cement Carriers, Inc., 277 S.C. 91, 94, 282 S.E.2d 858, 859&nbsp;(1981).\r\nUnless provided for in sections 15-7-10 or 15-7-20 of the South Carolina Code (2005), all actions â€œshall be tried in the county in which the defendant resides at the time of the commencement of the action.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-7-30 (2005);[6] see also Jeter v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 369 S.C. 433, ___, 633 S.E.2d 143, 147 (2006) (interpreting section 15-7-30 to mean all cases not falling within sections 15-7-10 or 15-7-20 must be tried in the county of defendantâ€™s residence).Â  Section 15-7-10 provides that actions â€œ[f]or the recovery of real property or of an estate or interest therein or for the determination in any form of such right or interest and for injuries to real property,â€ must be tried in the county in which the â€œsubject of the actionâ€ or some part thereof is situated.[7]Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nIn Coastal Mall, Inc. v. Askins, 265 S.C. 307, 217 S.E.2d 725 (1975), the Supreme Court of South Carolina analyzed the rule fixing venue of actions for injuries to real property.Â  The court noted â€œthe term â€˜injuryâ€™ is used in a technical sense and as meaning every wrong which in legal contemplation is an injury to real property, and the rule is not limited to actions for physical injury to realty, or to physical interference therewith . . .â€Â  Id. at 310, 217 S.E.2d at 726 (citation omitted).Â  The court also noted a statute relating to actions for injuries to real property does not apply â€œwhere an action for certain relief is essentially one to enforce a personal obligation.â€Â  Id. at 310, 217 S.E.2d at 727 (citation omitted).Â  The court found the pivotal question at hand was not whether there was any remote or incidental injury to real property, but rather what is â€œthe subject of the action.â€Â  Id. at 311, 217 S.E.2d at 727.Â  The court interpreted â€œsubject of the actionâ€ to mean â€œthe plaintiffâ€™s primary right.â€Â  Id. at 311-12, 217 S.E.2d at 727.\r\nIn Coastal Mall, the defendant, Askins, agreed to construct a business mall, including a pre-designed canopy structure, for Coastal Mall.Â  When a portion of the canopy collapsed rendering it useless, Coastal Mall filed an action alleging Askins negligently installed the canopy structure.Â  The court found the â€œsubject of the actionâ€ was Coastal Mallâ€™s right to have a construction contract properly performed.Â  Id. at 312, 217 S.E.2d at 727.Â  Thus, the court held venue was not proper in the county of Coastal Mallâ€™s property and should have been transferred to the county of Askinsâ€™s residence.Â  Id. at 312, 217 S.E.2d at 727-28.Â  \r\nSimilarly, in Friarsgate, Inc. v. Irmo, 281 S.C. 588, 589, 316 S.E.2d 423, 424 (Ct. App. 1984), this court held section 15-7-10 was inapplicable.Â  In Friarsgate, the court found no injury to real property because the suit was not filed to â€œrecover an estate or interest in real property,â€ or â€œfor a determination that it has an estate or interest in real property.â€Â  Id.  \r\nThus, in order to find venue is proper under section 15-7-30, the court must find the â€œplaintiffâ€™s primary rightâ€ arises from an injury to real property; it is not sufficient to find an injury to real property has resulted from the actions of the defendant.Â  In this case, the main impetus behind the lawsuit is the alleged breach of contract and/or negligence in constructing the outdoor signs by Eadon.Â  Indeed, as in Coastal Mall, â€œif there be any â€˜injury to real propertyâ€™ involved in this case such was only to that which became realty upon being constructed by the defendant under his contract.â€Â  265 S.C. at 311, 217 S.E.2d at 727. Â Accordingly, we find venue was not proper in Fairfield County and the trial court erred in failing to grant Eadonâ€™s motion to transfer venue to Clarendon County.Â  Because the trial court had no jurisdiction to do anything but grant a change in venue, we reverse and remand for entry of an order changing the venue to Clarendon County.[8]  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing we hold the trial court erred in denying the motion to transfer venue.Â  In view of our disposition of this case, we need not address Appellantâ€™s remaining issues. Â See Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (stating appellate court need not address remaining issues when resolution of prior issue is dispositive). Â The decision of the circuit court is accordingly\r\n REVERSED and REMANDED. \r\n ANDERSON, HUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp;\r\nRhodes is President and sole owner of Piedmont. \r\n[2]&nbsp; Under the Highway Advertising Control Act, the General Assembly granted SCDOT the authority to issue permits for the erection and maintenance of commercial outdoor signs and to promulgate regulations governing the issuance of permits.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§57-25-150(A) (Supp. 2001).Â  The Act generally limits the placement of commercial outdoor advertising signs to zoned industrial areas, zoned commercial areas, unzoned commercial areas, or unzoned industrial areas.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§57-25-140(7) &amp; (8) (Supp. 2001).Â  \r\n[3]&nbsp; According to S.C. Code Ann Â§ 57-25-120(4) (Supp. 2000) an unzoned commercial or industrial area is â€œthe land occupied by the regularly used building, parking lot, and storage and processing area of a commercial business or industrial activity and land within six hundred feet of it on both sides of the highway.â€\r\n[4]&nbsp;\r\nA sham activity is defined as, â€œany activity that is seemingly a commercial or industrial activity but which was created primarily or exclusively to qualify an area as an unzoned commercial or industrial area and which does not conduct any meaningful business at the activity site.â€Â  25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 63-342 (U) (Supp. 2000).Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n[5]&nbsp;\r\nThe ALJ acknowledged that Piedmont initially qualified for the permits by proposing to conduct a commercial business within six hundred feet of the highway.Â  However, the ALJ found Interstate failed to maintain the standards established to constitute qualifying commercial activity, citing that the water service was cut off, there was no operable restroom, the cars onsite were vandalized and had not been repaired and that two or three cars were inoperable. \r\n[6]&nbsp; The 2005 amendments to 15-7-30 are not applicable to this case. Â See 15-7-30 (Supp. 2005) (providing amendments are applicable to causes of action arising on or after July 1, 2005).\r\n[7]&nbsp; The 2006 amendments to 15-7-10 are not applicable to this case. Â See Act No. 354, 2006 S.C. Acts 2779, 2780 (providing amendment does not affect pending actions).Â  Â \r\n[8]&nbsp; We note the unchallenged ruling by the trial court that the signs were fixtures on Rhodesâ€™s property does not affect our decision.Â  The fact the signs were fixtures is irrelevant for determining whether the â€œsubject of the actionâ€ involves an injury to real estate.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-414","title":"State v.

McDuffie Stone, III, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Walter Jenkins was indicted for distribution of crack cocaine and distribution of crack cocaine within a half mile of a school. Â He was convicted as charged and the trial court sentenced him to ten years imprisonment on each charge, the sentences to run concurrently.Â  Jenkins appeals, arguing the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury on the defense of entrapment.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn April 14, 2004, officers with the Beaufort County Drug Task Force set up a controlled buy using a confidential informant (hereinafter informant) to purchase drugs.Â  The informant was searched, equipped with audio and video recording devices, given $40 of prerecorded money, and dropped off in close proximity to the targeted location, a well known drug house and the home of Walter Jenkins.Â  \r\nThe informant testified that on April 14, 2004, he made a drug buy for the Drug Task Force.Â  On that day, Walter Jenkins was the target of the controlled buy.[2]Â  Prior to going to the targeted location, the informant told the officer the target in this case may want to be paid in drugs and asked what he should do if the target asked for a portion of the crack instead of money for payment.Â  The officer instructed the informant not to distribute the drugs himself, but it was okay if the target â€œpinchedâ€ out of the bag, taking part of the crack himself.Â  The informant testified that a â€œpinching paymentâ€ is considered a standard custom.Â  \r\nWhen the informant arrived at Jenkinsâ€™ home, Jenkinsâ€™ nephew directed him to the bedroom.Â  The informant approached Jenkins and told him that he wanted to â€œget something for forty.â€Â  Jenkins responded by asking the informant where he was going to get it.Â  The informant suggested a man who lived around the corner named Henry may have something.Â  Jenkins then picked up the phone and dialed a number.Â  While talking on the phone, Jenkins stated he would â€œpick them up at the gate within two minutes.â€ Â The informant stated he did not hand Jenkins the phone or give him any information other than suggesting Henry as a possible source.Â  The informant did not know who Jenkins talked to on the phone.Â  The informant gave Jenkins $40, Jenkins left, and the informant remained in the room waiting for him.Â  When Jenkins retuned, he had a plastic bag containing crack in his hand.Â  Jenkins told the informant to give him a portion of the crack in payment, and the informant instructed Jenkins to take what he thought he deserved.Â  Once Jenkins took a portion, he handed the bag with the remainder of the crack to the informant and the informant left.Â  In response to a question on cross-examination, the informant stated the reason he chose to â€œgo thereâ€ was because he had â€œpurchased drugs from Mr. Walter Jenkins in the past.â€Â  \r\nAt the close of the Stateâ€™s case, Jenkins moved for a directed verdict arguing, in part, that the facts showed he was â€œentrapped in the sale of cocaine.â€Â  The court denied the motion.Â  The defense then rested without presenting any evidence.Â  Thereafter, Jenkins requested the court charge the jury on the defense of entrapment.Â  The State opposed the charge.Â  The trial court determined there was evidence of record that the informant had purchased drugs from Jenkins in the past, and declined to charge the law on entrapment.Â  The jury found Jenkins guilty on both the distribution and proximity charge and the court sentenced him to concurrent ten year sentences.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nJenkins argues the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the defense of entrapment. Â We disagree.\r\nâ€œ[E]ntrapment occurs: â€˜(W)here one is instigated, induced or lured by an officer of the law or other person for the purpose of prosecution into the commission of a crime which he had otherwise no intention of committing.â€™â€Â  State v. Hayden, 268 S.C. 214, 219, 232 S.E.2d 889, 891 (1977) (quoting State v. Haulcomb, 260 S.C. 260, 195 S.E.2d 601 (1973)).Â  â€œThe affirmative defense of entrapment is available where there is the â€˜conception and planning of an offense by an officer, and his procurement of its commission by one who would not have perpetrated it except for trickery, persuasion, or fraud of the officer.â€™â€Â  State v. Johnson, 295 S.C. 215, 216, 367 S.E.2d 700, 701 (1988) (quoting State v. Jacobs, 238 S.C. 234, 244, 119 S.E.2d 735, 740 (1961)) (emphasis added).Â  â€œIt is a well settled principle of law that the defense of entrapment is not available to a defendant exhibiting a predisposition to commit a crime independent of governmental inducement and influence.â€Â  Id. at 217, 367 S.E.2d at 701. Although a confidential informant is not a law enforcement officer, where he acts at the behest of an officer, his actions may amount to governmental trickery or persuasion.Â  Id.Â  at 216 n.1, 367 S.E. 2d at 701 n.1.Â  One who pleads entrapment has the burden of showing that he was induced, tricked or incited to commit a crime, which he would not otherwise have committed.Â Â Â  Id. at 217, 367 S.E.2d at 701.Â  â€œThe fact that a government official â€˜merely afford[s] opportunities or facilities for the commission of the offense does not constitute entrapment.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting Sherman v. United States, 356 U.S. 369, 372, 78 S.Ct. 819, 821, 2 L.Ed.2d 848 (1958)).Â  See also, State v. Haulcomb, 260 S.C. 260, 269, 195 S.E.2d 601, 605 (1973) (â€œWhen a law enforcement officer merely provides an opportunity for crime, no entrapment is envolved.â€).Â  The entrapment defense consists of the following two elements:Â  (1) government inducement, and (2) lack of predisposition.Â  State v. Brown, 362 S.C. 258, 262, 607 S.E.2d 93, 95 (Ct. App. 2004) (citing Matthews v. United States, 485 U.S. 58, 63, 108 S.Ct. 883, 99 L.Ed.2d 54 (1988)).Â  â€œThus, â€˜[t]he court may find as a matter of law that no entrapment existed, when there is no evidence in the record that, if believed by the jury, would show that the governmentâ€™s conduct created a substantial risk that the offense would be committed by a person other than one ready and willing to commit it.â€™â€Â  Id. at 263, 607 S.E.2d at 95 (quoting United States v. Osborne, 935 F.2d 32, 38 (4th Cir.1991)).\r\nIn State v. Brown, 362 S.C. 258, 607 S.E.2d 93 (Ct. App. 2004), this court found the defendant was entitled to a jury charge on the law of entrapment.Â  However, in Brown, we noted there was no evidence of any prior drug transactions between the confidential informant and Brown.Â  Id. at 264, 607 S.E.2d at 96. Â Nor was there any evidence of record that Brown had a history of drug dealing.Â  Id. at 261 n.1, 607 S.E.2d at 94 n.1.Â  We further found there was evidence of record of Brownâ€™s lack of predisposition to commit the offense of distribution of cocaine.Â  Id. at 264-65, 607 S.E.2d at 96. \r\nUnlike Brown, the evidence in the case at hand shows Jenkinsâ€™ predisposition to participate in illegal drug activity.Â  After the informant told Jenkins he wanted to â€œget something for fortyâ€ and suggested Henry may have something, Jenkins, on his own, picked up the phone, dialed a number, and spoke with someone, stating to that party he would â€œpick them up at the gate within two minutes.â€Â  When the informant gave Jenkins $40, Jenkins left and shortly thereafter retuned with crack cocaine. Â Jenkins then gave the crack cocaine to the informant and received a portion of the drug in payment.Â  Further, the record contains undisputed evidence the informant had purchased drugs from Jenkins in the past.Â  \r\nThis case is more in line with this courtâ€™s decision in State v. Cooper, 302 S.C. 184, 394 S.E.2d 717 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  There, we found no error in the trial courtâ€™s refusal to charge the jury on the defense of entrapment.Â  Id. at 185, 394 S.E.2d at 718. Â Cooperâ€™s conviction arose out of her delivery of drugs to an undercover agent, which she purchased from a dealer with money supplied by the undercover agent. Â Id. Â Noting evidence that Cooper was an â€œadmitted purchaserâ€ of crack cocaine, that she participated in the drug buy expecting to share in the purchase, and did in fact receive a portion of crack cocaine in payment, we determined the evidence showed Cooper engaged in illegal activity because of her own preexisting readiness to do so.Â  Id. at 186, 394 S.E.2d at 718.Â  \r\nAs in Cooper, the evidence shows Jenkins engaged in the drug deal, not because of any governmental inducement, but because he was ready and willing to engage in the illegal activity and was predisposed to commit the crime.Â  We therefore find no error in the trial courtâ€™s refusal to charge the jury on the defense of entrapment.Â  Accordingly, Jenkinsâ€™ convictions are Â \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] While Jenkins was the target that day, the case officer on this matter testified the target location was a well known drug house and anyone at the house could have sold the drugs and that would have â€œconstituted our buy.â€Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-415","title":"SCDSS v.

Myers, of Lexington, for Appellant.\r\nChief Attorney Joseph L. Savitz, III, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The State appeals the circuit courtâ€™s decision to suppress evidence based on a violation of Kimberly Mayzesâ€™ Fourth Amendment rights.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nOn October 25, 2002, while at Lizardâ€™s Thicket Restaurant, Kimberly Mayzes phoned the Springdale Police Department to report someone had stolen her pocketbook.Â  Officer Charles Flenniken responded and proceeded to interview Mayzes about the contents of the pocketbook.Â \r\nRather than describing the normal contents of a pocketbook to Flenniken, such as a driverâ€™s license, credit cards, or a social security card, Mayzes informed Flenniken a prescription of Xanax was in the stolen pocketbook.Â  Flenniken noted Mayzes seemed anxious and more concerned about this prescription than the other contents.Â  \r\nFlenniken questioned the manager and the waitress about the stolen pocketbook.Â  The waitress did not remember seeing Mayzes with the pocketbook in Lizardâ€™s Thicket.Â  At this point, Flenniken told Mayzes to sit in a car driven by Lori Young.[1]Â  Flenniken admitted, at this time, he did not have a reasonable basis to believe a crime had been committed.Â  Based on Mayzesâ€™ behavior, he merely believed â€œsomething didnâ€™t appear to be right . . . .â€\r\nAfterward, Flenniken phoned Dr. Counts, whom Mayzes said wrote the Xanax prescription.Â  Dr. Counts explained Mayzes had called several times to obtain additional prescriptions of Xanax.Â  \r\nSubsequently, Flenniken exited the restaurant and walked towards Youngâ€™s vehicle.Â  After obtaining Youngâ€™s consent to search the automobile, Flenniken explained to Mayzes it was in her interest to search the vehicle to ensure the pocketbook was not there.Â  Mayzes exited the vehicle and went directly to the trunk, without searching anywhere else, and found her pocketbook.Â  \r\nMayzes thanked Flenniken for his help and was about to leave, but Flenniken insisted she accompany him back into the restaurant.Â  Flenniken testified that when they walked back into the restaurant, Mayzes was not free to leave.Â  The State conceded when Flenniken and Mayzes returned inside Lizardâ€™s Thicket, Flenniken did not know if any criminal charges could be pressed against Mayzes.[2]Â Â Â  \r\nShortly thereafter, Flennikenâ€™s supervisor, Corporal Matt Johnson, arrived at the scene.Â  While Johnson and Flenniken were discussing the situation, Mayzes walked away from the officers and towards a restaurant employee who was using a pay telephone.Â  Flenniken observed the employee yell out and raise his arms in the air.Â  Flenniken and Johnson walked towards the telephone to discover the source of the employeeâ€™s reaction. \r\nAs the officers approached, they saw a bag of marijuana and arrested Mayzes.Â  After reading Mayzes her Miranda[3] rights the officers questioned Mayzes.Â  She revealed that Young also had marijuana.Â  Mayzes, Johnson, and Flenniken walked outside, and Flenniken asked Young if she had any drugs in her possession.Â  Young admitted to having marijuana in her pocket.Â  Consequently, Flenniken placed Young under arrest and transported Young and Mayzes to Lexington County jail.Â  \r\nAfter the police booked Mayzes, she was held in a temporary holding area where she made a phone call.Â  Flenniken, also in the booking area waiting for paper work, overheard Mayzes state: â€œPriscilla get Tommy to go to Lizardâ€™s Thicket on 302 to pick up a package.Â  He would know what it was when he got there.Â  He would know what it was when he saw it.Â  Hurry up and get there in the next half hour.Â  It was (sic) stuck on the floor between the paper machines.â€[4]Â  \r\nFlenniken questioned her about this conversation, Mayzes replied the package was a gold necklace that was a birthday present for her son.Â  Flenniken did not believe Mayzes, so he requested Officer Bouknight to investigate the contents of the package.Â  Instead of finding a gold necklace in the package, Bouknight found a baseball-sized red and white substance, later determined to be crystal methamphetamine.Â  \r\nConsequently, Mayzes was charged with possession with intent to distribute marijuana, possession with intent to distribute marijuana within proximity of a school, and trafficking methamphetamines.Â  Co-defendant Charles Manley was charged with trafficking methamphetamine.Â  The defense made a motion to the circuit court to suppress all evidence on the basis of a violation of the Fourth Amendment and the â€œfruit of the poisonous treeâ€ doctrine.Â  \r\nThe circuit court found: (1) Flenniken seized or detained Mayzes when he told her to sit in the car while he called Dr. Counts; (2) the seizure occurred even though no reasonable suspicion existed; and (3) as a result of the unlawful seizure Mayzesâ€™ Fourth Amendment rights were violated.Â  Additionally, the circuit court suppressed all the evidence procured subsequent to Flennikenâ€™s seizure of Mayzes, based upon the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.\r\nThe State contends the circuit court erred in suppressing the evidence because Mayzes was not seized within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when Flenniken told her to sit in Youngâ€™s car.Â  In the alternative, the State asserts even if Mayzes was seized, a reasonable basis for the detention existed.Â Â  This appeal follows.[5]\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing a Fourth Amendment search and seizure case, we do not review the circuit judgeâ€™s ultimate determination de novo, rather we apply a deferential standard.Â \r\nState v. Khingratsaiphon, 352 S.C. 62, 70, 572 S.E.2d 456, 459-60 (2002).Â  This Court reviews the circuit judgeâ€™s ruling like any other factual finding, and we will reverse only if there is clear error.Â  Id.Â  Therefore, we will affirm if any evidence exists to support the circuit courtâ€™s ruling.Â  Id.; see, e.g., State v. Missouri, 361 S.C. 107, 111, 603 S.E. 2d 594, 596 (2004) (â€œWhen reviewing a Fourth Amendment search and seizure case, an appellate court must affirm the trial judgeâ€™s ruling if there is any evidence to support the ruling. The appellate court will reverse only when there is clear error.â€) (emphasis in original) (internal citation omitted); State v. Brockman, 339 S.C. 57, 66, 528 S.E.2d 661, 666 (2000) (explaining an appellate court reviews the circuit courtâ€™s Fourth Amendment ruling like any other factual finding and reverses if there is clear error but affirms if there is any evidence to support the circuit court).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA. Mayzesâ€™ seizure under the Fourth Amendment \r\nThe Fourth Amendment provides â€œThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated . . . .â€Â  U.S. Const. amend. IV.Â  The right of an individual not to be arbitrarily seized by the government is one of our most important rights, and this right will be carefully guarded.Â  State v. Rodriquez, 323 S.C. 484, 490, 476 S.E.2d 161, 164-65 Â (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Any evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment must be excluded.Â  Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 655 (1961).\r\nIt is well established that warrantless searches and seizures by the police are per se unreasonable unless they fall within one of several recognized exceptions.Â  Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 357 (1967).Â  However, Fourth Amendment protection applies if there has been a search or seizure by the government.Â \r\nUnited States v. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 113-14 (1984).Â  Â Not all personal encounters with the police can be characterized as seizures.Â  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 19-20 (1968).Â  \r\nWhenever a police officer, by means of force or authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen, a â€œseizureâ€ has occurred.Â  Id.Â  In other words, a person has been seized within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment â€œwhenever a police officer accosts [the] individual and restrains his freedom to walk away . . . .â€ Â Â Id. at 16.Â  E.g., Sikes v. State, 323 S.C. 28, 30, 448 S.E.2d 560, 562 (1994) (â€œAn individual is â€˜seizedâ€™ when an officer restrains his freedom, even if the detention is brief and falls short of arrest.â€).Â  \r\nIn determining whether a seizure has occurred, the correct inquiry is whether, considering all the circumstances surrounding the encounter, a reasonable person would have believed she was not free to leave.Â \r\nUnited States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 553-54 (1980).Â  If the person approached and questioned is free to ignore the policeâ€™s questions and walk away, there has been no intrusion upon that personâ€™s liberty or privacy.Â  Id. Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe State argues a seizure did not arise until Mayzes recovered her pocketbook and Flenniken told Mayzes she was not free to leave.Â  Conversely, Mayzes argues a seizure occurred when she was told by Flenniken to sit in Youngâ€™s car while he called Dr. Counts.Â  We agree with\r\nMayzes.\r\nAt the time of the encounter with Mayzes, Flenniken was wearing a police uniform and had a badge; thus, Flenniken was acting with the authority of a police officer.Â  By means of this authority, Flenniken restrained and intruded on Mayzesâ€™ liberty because he told her to sit in Youngâ€™s car without having a reasonable belief a crime had been committed.Â  Flennikenâ€™s statement to Mayzes, telling her to go and wait in the car, was not a request, rather it was an order.Â  Flenniken did not hint or suggest that Mayzes should wait in the car.Â  Instead, he â€œtold her to sit in the car . . . .â€Â  (emphasis added).\r\nA reasonable person would feel she was not free to leave when a police officer tells her â€œto sit in a car.â€Â  A reasonable person would feel if she disobeyed the policeâ€™s order to go where directed, she would get into more trouble.Â  Therefore, a reasonable person would not feel she was free to ignore Flenniken and simply walk away.Â  Mayzesâ€™ testimony confirms this conclusion.\r\nMayzes testified it was apparent to her that Flenniken was a police officer because he wore a police uniform and had a badge.Â  She further testified when Flenniken told her to sit and wait, she believed she was not free to leave.Â  Additionally, when asked what she thought would happen if she attempted to leave the scene, Mayzes responded Flenniken would pursue her.Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing, we cannot say the circuit court committed clear error in determining a seizure occurred when Flenniken told Mayzes to go and wait in Youngâ€™s car.Â  \r\nB. Mayzesâ€™ seizure was unreasonable \r\nHaving determined to uphold the circuit courtâ€™s ruling that Mayzes was seized, we must decide whether her Fourth Amendment rights were thereby violated.Â  The United States Constitution does not prohibit all searches and seizures but only unreasonable searches and seizures.Â  Elkins v. United States, 364 U.S. 206, 222 (1960).Â  It is well known the police may stop and briefly detain and question a person, even if no probable cause exists.Â  Terry, 392 U.S. at 20.Â  However, there must be a reasonable suspicion supported by specific and articulable facts, and any rational inferences drawn therefrom, that the person is involved in criminal activity.Â  Id. at 21.Â  \r\nFlennikenâ€™s testimony shows he had no reasonable suspicion to believe a crime had been committed; at most, he merely â€œhad a hunch.â€Â  The following is an excerpt from Flennikenâ€™s cross-examination by Mayzesâ€™ trial counsel:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;\r\n       Iâ€™m going to repeat the question.Â  The question is at the point in time that you had a hunch that a red flag was raised, thatâ€™s the point in time that you told her\r\n        [Mayzes] to go sit in the vehicle.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:\r\n       Correct.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:\r\n       And at that point in time, itâ€™s nothing but a mere hunch.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:\r\n       Correct.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:\r\n       Because you told the court that you had no reasonable basis at that time to believe that a crime was being committed.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:\r\n       Correct.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;\r\n       Nevertheless, you told her that she needed to go sit in the vehicle.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:\r\n       Correct.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nIntrusions upon constitutionally guaranteed rights must be based on more than inarticulable hunches.Â  Terry, 392 U.S. at 22.Â  Additionally, United States v. Burton, 228 F.3d 526 (4th Cir. 2002), supports the circuit courtâ€™s conclusion.Â  \r\nOn the afternoon of March 4, 1998, while at a payphone in Laurens, South Carolina, four police officers approached Kenneth Burton.Â \r\nUnited States v. Burton, 228 F.3d 524, 526 (4th Cir. 2000).Â  Officer Tracy Burke identified himself as a police officer and requested Burton provide him with identification.Â  Id.Â  Rather than complying with the request, Burton did not respond.Â  Id.Â  The officers repeated the request for identification several times, but Burton remained silent.Â  Id.Â  Thereafter, the officers asked Burton to remove his right hand from his coat pocket, but Burton failed to comply with the request.Â  Id.Â  The officers repeated their request, however Burton did not respond.Â  Id.\r\nOffice Burke positioned himself behind Burton and plunged his hand into Burtonâ€™s coat.Â  Id.Â  Burton opposed, and a struggle followed, during which the remaining three officers wrestled Burton to the ground.Â  Id.Â  Burton pointed a gun at Officer Burke and tried to fire, but the gun was jammed and did not fire.Â  Id.Â  Burton was indicted for violation of state[6] and federal[7] law.Â  Id.Â  \r\nAt the federal district court, Burton moved to suppress the firearm as fruit of an illegal search.Â  Id.Â  At the evidentiary hearing, Officer Burke testified that â€œat the time he approached Burton, he had no reason to suspect that Burton was engaged in criminal activity . . . .â€Â  Id.Â  The federal court denied Burtonâ€™s motion; subsequently, Burton was convicted and sentenced to 115 months imprisonment.Â  Id.Â  Burton appealed to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.Â  Id.\r\nThe Fourth Circuit reversed the district court and concluded Officer Burke did not have reasonable suspicion for the search; therefore, Officer Burkeâ€™s actions constituted an illegal search.Â  Id.Â  In reaching this conclusion, the Fourth Circuit recognized Officer Burkeâ€™s testimony confirmed he had no objective facts that would justify reasonable suspicion.Â  Id.Â  at 528. \r\nAs mentioned above, in addition to the federal charges, Burton was indicted on state charges.Â  Burton, 356 S.C. at 263, 589 S.E.2d at 8.Â  Burton unsuccessfully made a motion to the circuit court to grant a directed verdict in his favor because the search was not supported by reasonable suspicion.Â  Id. at 265, 589 S.E.2d at 9.Â  On appeal, this Court reversed the circuit court, concluding the search was not supported by reasonable suspicion and was based on â€œan inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch.â€Â  State v. Burton, 349 S.C. 430, 438, 562 S.E.2d 668, 672 (Ct. App. 2002) (internal quotations omitted) overruled on other grounds by State v. Burton, 356 S.C. 263, 589 S.E.2d 8 (2003).Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court overruled this Court because the illegal search issue was not preserved.Â Â  Burton, 356 S.C. at 265, 589 S.E.2d at 9.Â  However, the Supreme Court agreed with this Court on the ruling regarding the illegality of search and seizure.Â  Id.Â  (â€œWe agree with the Court of Appeals that the search and seizure of Burton was illegal and we look with disapproval on the officersâ€™ conduct leading up to the seizure.â€)Â  \r\nJust as in the Burton case, Flenniken testified he had no reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot when he told Mayzes to sit in the car.Â  As such we hold some evidence exists to uphold the circuit courtâ€™s determination that Mayzesâ€™ Fourth Amendment rights were violated when Flenniken told Mayzes to wait in Youngâ€™s car.\r\nC. Exclusion of evidence as a result of Mayzesâ€™ illegal seizure\r\nIn addition to holding Mayzesâ€™ Fourth Amendment rights were violated, the circuit court used the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine to suppress all the evidence procured from Flennikenâ€™s seizure of\r\nMayzes.&nbsp; \r\nThe fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine, most often associated with violations of the Fourth Amendmentâ€™s prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures, prohibits the use of evidence obtained directly or indirectly through an unlawful search or seizure.Â  Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 484 (1963).Â  \r\nIn this case, the circuit court concluded Mayzesâ€™ Fourth Amendment rights were violated when she was seized, and any evidence obtained from that unlawful seizure was excluded.Â  This evidence included: the bag of marijuana found at Lizardâ€™s Thicket; the statements made by Mayzes while she was in the holding area, which were overheard by officers Flenniken and Kelly; and the baseball-sized crystal methamphetamine.Â  \r\nThe circuit court did not commit clear error in using the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine to exclude the evidence obtained as a result of Mayzesâ€™ unlawful seizure. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAlthough this Court in no way condones Mayzesâ€™ possession of illegal substances, and we recognize the State makes a compelling argument, we must uphold the circuit courtâ€™s ruling because we are constrained by the Fourth Amendment and the applicable standard of review. Â Â \r\nAccordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Apparently, Young and Mayzes came in the same car to Lizardâ€™s Thicket. \r\n[2] Flenniken gave contradictory testimony as to whether he thought a crime had or was being committed at this time.Â  For example, at one point he testified: â€œI did not know if I had a charge at that point to press charges against her for trying to obtain a controlled substance by fraud.â€Â  Conversely, he also stated: â€œAt that point, I believed that a crime had been committed and that she [Mayzes] had committed it.â€ \r\n[3] Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). \r\n[4] In addition to Flenniken, Officer Kelly overheard Mayzesâ€™ conversation.Â  \r\n[5] A pre-trial order granting the suppression of evidence, which significantly impairs the prosecution of a criminal case, is directly appealable.Â  State v. McKnight, 287 S.C. 167, 168, 337 S.E.2d 208, 209 (1985); see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(2)(a) (1976).Â  \r\n[6] Burtonâ€™s state violations included two counts of assault while resisting arrest and two counts of assault with intent to kill.Â  State v. Burton, 356 S.C. 259, 263, 589 S.E.2d 6, 8 (2003).\r\n[7] Burtonâ€™s federal violation was unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon.Â  18 U.S.C.

Turner, both of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Delphine Mitchell (Claimant) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order affirming the denial of workerâ€™s compensation benefits.Â  Claimant argues the circuit courtâ€™s decision was erroneous and should be reversed because: Â (1) the First Appellate Panel failed to comply with section 1-23-350 of the South Carolina Code (2005); (2) the First Appellate Panel erred in finding she did not suffer an occupational disease; (3) the Second Appellate Panel lacked jurisdiction to find chemicals at her work did not cause her asthma; and (4) the Second Appellate Panel erred in finding chemicals at work did not cause her asthma.[1] Â We affirm.[2]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn August 1, 1999, Claimant began working as a custodian for Florence County School District #1 (Employer).Â  As part of her duties, she worked with various cleaning chemicals.Â  On March 25, 2001, Claimant admitted herself into Carolinas Hospital System because she had problems breathing.Â  Dr. Robert Richey, a physician specializing in internal medicine, diagnosed Claimant with asthma. Â Dr. Richey also consulted Dr. Mark Bernard, a pulmonologist.Â  Dr. Bernard concurred with Dr. Richeyâ€™s diagnosis of asthma.Â Â Â  \r\nClaimant applied for temporary total disability benefits, arguing the cleaning chemicals caused her asthma.Â  Employer and the South Carolina School Board Insurance Trust (Carrier) contested coverage.Â  Commissioner Sherry Shealy Martschink heard the case, made detailed findings of fact, and determined the asthma was an occupational disease.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-11-10 (1985) (defining occupational disease). Â The First Appellate Panel reversed, simply stating â€œ[b]ased on the evidence in the record and the medical evidence, Claimant has failed to prove an occupational disease.â€Â  The First Appellate Panel remanded the case â€œto the jurisdictional commissioner for a hearing on the merits of whether this is an injury by accident.â€Â  Claimant appealed to the circuit court.Â  The Honorable James E. Brogdon, Jr., held the First Appellate Panelâ€™s order was not immediately appealable and remanded the case to the commissioner.\r\nOn remand, Commissioner J. Michelle Childs took evidence and held the asthma was an injury by accident.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2005) (defining injury by accident).Â  The Second Appellate Panel reversed, holding â€œ[t]here is no evidence in the record that the Claimantâ€™s asthmas [sic] was caused by the inhalation of any chemicals at work.Â  There is no evidence that Claimantâ€™s asthma arose out of the course and scope of her employment.â€Â  Claimant appealed the First Appellate Panelâ€™s and Second Appellate Panelâ€™s orders to the circuit court.Â  The Honorable B. Hicks Harwell, Jr., affirmed both appellate panels, and this appeal followed.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nClaimant contends the circuit court erred in affirming the denial of workerâ€™s compensation benefits because the First Appellate Panel failed to comply with section 1-23-350 of the South Carolina Code (2005). Â Although we agree with Claimantâ€™s contention, we find any error to be harmless.Â  \r\nThe relevant part of section 1-23-350 provides:\r\n\r\nA final decision or order adverse to a party in a contested case shall be in writing or stated in the record. Â A final decision shall include findings of fact and conclusions of law, separately stated. Â Findings of fact, if set forth in statutory language, shall be accompanied by a concise and explicit statement of the underlying facts supporting the findings.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-350 (2005).\r\nJudge Harwell held section 1-23-350 did not apply to the First Appellate Panelâ€™s order because that order was not final.Â  Alternatively, Judge Harwell held Judge Brogdon ruled the order was not final, and this ruling is the law of the case.\r\nWe do not believe Judge Brogdonâ€™s ruling is dispositive of this issue.Â  Judge Brogdon clearly contemplated the First Appellate Panelâ€™s order would become final, and thus appealable, after remand.Â  He held â€œthe finding of this Court [is] that the Order of the [First Appellate Panel] is not appealable at this time to the Circuit Court.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  He further noted â€œthe remand for a hearing on the issue of injury by accident must occur before there is a final decision on the meritsâ€ and â€œ[t]his Order in no way prejudices the Claimantâ€™s right to appeal to this Court on both the issue of whether the Claimant has sustained an occupational disease . . . .â€Â  Under these circumstances, the First Appellate Panelâ€™s order became a final order subject to section 1-23-350 after the Second Appellate Panel issued its order.Â  Therefore, we address the merits of this issue.Â  \r\nIn analyzing this issue, we are guided by our supreme courtâ€™s decision in Fox v. Newberry County Memâ€™l Hosp., 319 S.C. 278, 279, 461 S.E.2d 392, 393&nbsp;(1995).Â  In that case, Fox sought workerâ€™s compensation benefits from her employer, claiming she contracted herpetic whitlow.Â  On appeal to the circuit court, the employer and insurance carrier argued the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (the Commission) erred in failing to make specific findings of fact with respect to each of the elements comprising an occupational disease.Â \r\nId. at 280, 461 S.E.2d at 393.Â  Our supreme court agreed, remanding the case to the Commission for an order addressing each of these elements.Â  Id. at 282, 461 S.E.2d at 395.\r\nTurning to the instant case, the First Appellate Panel summarily held Claimant failed to prove an occupational disease.Â  Even though it cited Fox and listed the six elements of an occupational disease, it did not make findings of fact sufficient to allow this court to determine which of the elements the First Appellate Panel relied upon in reversing Commissioner Martschinkâ€™s decision.Â  \r\nDespite the First Appellate Panelâ€™s failure to strictly comply with the mandate of Fox, we find, as will be evident from later discussion, that this error did not affect our final analysis and provides no basis for reversal.Â  Accordingly, we find the alleged error to be harmless.\r\nII.\r\nA. \r\nClamant argues the circuit court erred in affirming the order of the Second Appellate Panel because the Second Appellate Panel lacked jurisdiction to determine whether the cleaning chemicals caused Claimantâ€™s asthma.Â  Claimant interprets the First Appellate Panelâ€™s order as a limitation on the jurisdiction of Commissioner Childs and, consequentially, the Second Appellate Panel.Â  Specifically, Claimant maintains the First Appellate Panelâ€™s order adopted the findings of fact of Commissioner Martschink and reversed only her finding Claimantâ€™s asthma was an occupational disease.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn construing an order, the determinative factor is the intent of the judge who wrote it, as gathered not from an isolated part of the order, but from all parts thereof.Â  Whiteâ€™s Mill Colony, Inc. v. Williams, 363 S.C. 117, 124 n.1, 609 S.E.2d 811, 815&nbsp;n.1 (Ct. App. 2005); Oâ€™Banner v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 319 S.C. 24, 29, 459 S.E.2d 324, 327&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995).\r\nHere, the First Appellate Panel clearly reversed Commissioner Martschinkâ€™s decision and substituted its own findings of fact and conclusions of law.Â  This order cannot be read to adopt any of Commissioner Martschinkâ€™s findings.Â  While Claimant relies on 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-707 (Supp. 2005), for the proposition Commissioner Childs could only make legal conclusions on remand, we note this regulation only applies when the appellate panel requires additional evidence to complete its review or a party requests newly-discovered evidence be admitted.[3]Â  We hold the First Appellate Panelâ€™s order did not limit Commissioner Childsâ€™ ability to make findings of fact in ruling on whether Claimantâ€™s asthma was an injury by accident.Â  A fortiori, the Second Appellate Panel also had jurisdiction to rule on this issue.\r\nB.\r\nClaimant argues that, even if the Second Appellate Panel had jurisdiction, the circuit court erred in affirming the Second Appellate Panelâ€™s decision that the cleaning chemicals did not cause Claimantâ€™s asthma.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 1-23-380(A)(6) of the South Carolina Code (2005)[4] governs our review of workersâ€™ compensation decisions.Â  Baxter v. Martin Bros., Inc., 368 S.C. 510, 513, 630 S.E.2d 42, 43&nbsp;(2006).Â  This courtâ€™s review is limited to deciding whether the appellate panelâ€™s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law.Â  Gadson v. Mikasa Corp., 368 S.C. 214, 221, 628 S.E.2d 262, 266&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).Â  Accordingly, a reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the appellate panel as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  Clark v. Aiken County Govâ€™t, 366 S.C. 102, 107, 620 S.E.2d 99, 101&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  We further note the final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the appellate panel.Â  Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 160, 519 S.E.2d 102, 105&nbsp;(1999). \r\nIn order to receive workersâ€™ compensation benefits, Claimant must prove that she sustained an â€œinjury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2005).Â  â€œThe term â€˜arose out ofâ€™ refers to the origin of the cause of the accident, while the term â€˜in the course ofâ€™ refers to the time, place, and circumstances under which the accident occurred.â€ Â Howell v. Pac. Columbia Mills, 291 S.C. 469, 471, 354 S.E.2d 384, 385 (1987).\r\nâ€œWhether there is any causal connection between employment and an injury is a question of fact for the Commission.â€Â  Sharpe, 336 S.C. at 159, 519 S.E.2d at 105.Â  â€œBecause causation is a question of fact, the full commissionâ€™s decision on the issue must be affirmed if it is supported by substantial evidence in the record.â€ Shuler v. Gregory Elec., 366 S.C. 435, 440, 622 S.E.2d 569, 571 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nTherefore, we must affirm the Second Appellate Panelâ€™s ruling unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  Nettles v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. #7, 341 S.C. 580, 586, 535 S.E.2d 146, 149 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is â€˜not a mere scintilla of evidence nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached or must have reached in order to justify its action.â€™â€Â  Miller by Miller v. State Roofing Co., 312 S.C. 452, 454, 441 S.E.2d 323, 324-25 (1994) (quoting Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981)).Â  â€œThe substantial evidence rule does not allow judicial fact-finding, or the substitution of judicial judgment for agency judgment.Â  A judgment upon which reasonable men might differ will not be set aside.â€Â  Toddâ€™s Ice Cream, Inc. v. South Carolina Employment Sec. Commâ€™n, 281 S.C. 254, 258, 315 S.E.2d 373, 375 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\nDr. Richey and Dr. Bernard saw Claimant several times from March 2001 to November 2001.Â  During this time, Claimant alternatively blamed steam from a dishwasher at her second job, dust from moving books at her custodial job, rain, and the cleaning chemicals for her asthma. Â In addition, medical charts predating her custodial job indicate she experienced â€œbronchospasmsâ€ before working for Employer.Â  Furthermore, Dr. Richey testified he believed the asthma â€œmore than likelyâ€ came from a virus and could have been triggered by cigarettes.Â  Claimant admitted to smoking.Â  \r\nBoth Dr. Richey and Dr. Bernard recommended Claimant not return to work because of the chemicals.Â  However, both later testified they made this recommendation out of an abundance of caution and not because they thought the chemicals caused or aggravated the asthma. Â Moreover, the two doctors agreed almost anything could have caused the asthma. Â Additionally, both testified the only way to tell the chemicals caused the asthma would be a pre-exposure and post-exposure test, which Claimant avoided taking.Â  Dr. Bernard testified he found no evidence the chemicals caused Claimantâ€™s asthma.Â  However, Employer asked Claimant to see Dr. Steven Sahn, who testified the chemicals caused or worsened Claimantâ€™s asthma.Â  \r\nAlthough a contrary inference can be made, substantial evidence supports the Second Appellate Panelâ€™s conclusion the cleaning chemicals did not cause Claimantâ€™s asthma.Â  See Tiller v. Natâ€™l Health Care Ctr. of Sumter, 334 S.C. 333, 338, 513 S.E.2d 843, 845&nbsp;(1999) (â€œWhere there is a conflict in the evidence, either by different witnesses or in the testimony of the same witness, the findings of fact of the Commission are conclusive.â€).Â  Moreover, this conclusion prevents Claimantâ€™s recovery of temporary total disability benefits under either a theory of injury by accident or occupational disease.[5]Â  See Grady L. Beard et al., The Law of Workersâ€™ Compensation Insurance in South Carolina 7-4 (4th ed. 2005) (â€œLike the injuries by accident, occupational diseases must â€˜arise out ofâ€™ and arise â€˜in the course ofâ€™ claimantsâ€™ employment.Â  These phrases carry the same significance for occupational diseases as they do when they refer to injuries by accident.â€).Â  Therefore, we hold Claimant cannot recover on her theory of injury by accident or occupational disease.Â  See Rule 220(c), SCACR (â€œThe appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, or judgment upon any ground appearing in the Record on Appeal.â€); Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 418, 526 S.E.2d 716, 722 (2000) (noting the appellate court may affirm the trial court based on any ground found in the record).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAlthough the First Appellate Panelâ€™s order did not strictly comply with the requirements of section 1-23-350 of the South Carolina Code, we find any error to be harmless.Â  We hold the Second Appellate Panel had jurisdiction to determine cleaning chemicals did not cause Claimantâ€™s asthma.Â  In addition, we find substantial evidence supports this finding.Â  Moreover, this finding prevents Claimant from recovering under theories of injury by accident or occupational disease.Â  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s order is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n ANDERSON, HUFF, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  As will be evident from the discussion of these issues, we have addressed them in a different order in the interest of clarity and brevity.\r\n[2] Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3]Â  The regulation relied on by Claimant provides:\r\n\r\nA. When additional evidence is necessary for the completion of the record in a case on review the Commission may, in its discretion, order such evidence taken before a Commissioner.\r\n    \r\nB. When a party seeks to introduce new evidence into the record on a case on review, the party shall file a motion and affidavit with the Commissionâ€™s\r\nJudicial Department.\r\n    \r\nC. The moving party must establish the new evidence is of the same nature and character required for granting a new trial and show:\r\n(1) The evidence sought to be introduced is not evidence of a cumulative or impeaching character but would likely have produced a different result had the evidence been procurable at the first hearing; and\r\n (2) The evidence was not known to the moving party at the time of the first hearing, by reasonable diligence the new evidence could not have been secured, and the discovery of the new evidence is being brought to the attention of the Commission immediately upon its discovery.\r\n  \r\n (a) File the motion and affidavit with proof of service as soon as the new evidence is discovered. The motion and affidavit may be filed with the Form 30.\r\n(b) Serve the opposing party pursuant to R.67-215.\r\n (c) Oral argument will not be heard on the motion. The Commission will act upon the motion and issue an order\r\nbefore the review hearing is held.\r\n (d) If the Commission grants the motion, the review hearing is stayed. The case will be remanded to the original Hearing Commissioner who may, unless otherwise provided, reconvene the hearing or admit the deposition of a witness into the record.\r\n (e) The original Hearing Commissioner will issue his or her findings and recommendations in the form of an order to the Commission and the parties.\r\n (f) Upon the receipt of the Commissionerâ€™s order, the Judicial Department will reset the case on the review hearing docket.\r\n (g) If the Commission denies the motion, the case may remain on the review hearing docket unless otherwise provided.\r\n  \r\n\r\n25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-707 (Supp. 2005).\r\n[4] Section 2 of Act No. 387, 2006 S.C. Acts 387 (the Act) amends section 1-23-380(A).Â  This amendment became effective on July 1, 2006.Â  However, this amendment does not substantively change our standard of review.\r\n[5] Section 42-11-10 of the South Carolina Code defines occupational disease as follows:\r\n\r\nThe words â€œoccupational diseaseâ€ mean a disease arising out of and in the course of employment which is due to hazards in excess of those ordinarily incident to employment and is peculiar to the occupation in which the employee is engaged. A disease shall be deemed an occupational disease only if caused by a hazard recognized as peculiar to a particular trade, process, occupation or employment as a direct result of continuous exposure to the normal working conditions thereof.\r\n    \r\n  No disease shall be deemed an occupational disease when:\r\n(1) It does not result directly and naturally from exposure in this State to the hazards peculiar to the particular employment;\r\n(2) It results from exposure to outside climatic conditions;\r\n(3) It is a contagious disease resulting from exposure to fellow employees or from a hazard to which the workman would have been equally exposed outside of his employment;\r\n(4) It is one of the ordinary diseases of life to which the general public is equally exposed, unless such disease follows as a complication and a natural incident of an occupational disease or unless there is a constant exposure peculiar to the occupation itself which makes such disease a hazard inherent in such occupation;\r\n(5) It is any disease of the cardiac, pulmonary or circulatory system not resulting directly from abnormal external gaseous pressure exerted upon the body or the natural entrance into the body through the skin or natural orifices thereof of foreign organic or inorganic matter under circumstances peculiar to the employment and the processes utilized therein; or\r\n(6) It is any chronic disease of the skeletal joints.\r\n\r\nS.C.

Clare, South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, Office of the Attorney General, of Columbia, and Solicitor C. Kelly Jackson, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  A Lee County jury convicted Willie Singletary (Singletary) of criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the first degree.Â  Singletary appeals his conviction, claiming the trial court committed reversible error when it improperly admitted his custodial statement.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nSingletary committed sexual misconduct against the victim, S.S., at some point on December 6th or 7th, 2003.[1] Â At the time of the assault, the nine-year-old victim lived with her mother and three siblings in Singletaryâ€™s mobile home.Â  Â Â \r\nS.S. testified that on December 7, 2003, she was in the kitchen of Singletaryâ€™s mobile home when he grabbed her and pulled her into his bedroom.Â  Once inside Singletaryâ€™s bedroom, S.S. testified that he shut the door and pulled down both of their pants.Â  With his hands over her mouth, he raped her digitally, anally, and vaginally.Â  Conversely, in Singletaryâ€™s confession, he claimed the incident occurred at the instigation of the victim outside of his mobile home on December 6, 2003.\r\nOn December 8, 2003, S.S.â€™s school teacher noticed that S.S. was frequently visiting the restroom, so she took S.S. to the school nurse.Â  Â School officials contacted DSS, and further medical examination revealed that S.S. had recently contracted Chlamydia, a sexually-transmitted disease. Â In addition, the examination showed S.S. experienced external injury as well as recent penetration to her anus but no conclusive penetration to her vagina. \r\nBased on the victimâ€™s report of the incident, the police contacted Singletary, and he voluntarily came to the police station.Â  Once inside the police station, the investigating police officer testified that he read Singletary his Miranda[2] rights and explained those rights to him in lay terms. Â According to the officer, Singletary never requested further explanation regarding any of his rights, but he signed the portion of the form acknowledging that he understood his rights. Â The officer testified that after he read Singletary his rights, he proceeded to read a waiver of rights form, which Singletary also signed.Â  \r\nSingletary, however, testified that the police never read him his Miranda rights. Â Singletary also stated that the acknowledgement and waiver of rights form was never read or presented to him, and he signed it without knowledge of the formâ€™s contents.Â  \r\nFurthermore, Singletary denied that the police ever showed him his custodial statement or read it to him, but he admitted to signing the custodial statement and to initialing it four times in the corners of the document. Â He also claimed he told the police he did not sexually assault S.S., and only the part about S.S. rubbing his back outside his mobile home was accurate. Â The custodial statement reads:\r\n\r\nOn Saturday December 6, 2003[,] I Willie was outside working on my car[,] a 1995 Chevy Silver in color.Â  [S.S.] came outside where I was.Â  I was on my knees unlocking my hood because itâ€™s chained down.Â  While I was on my knees, [S.S.] jump [sic] on my back and started working up on me.Â  [S.S.] also started touching my penis.Â  [S.S.] grab [sic] my hand and put it on her vagina.Â  I started touching her back.Â  She got my penis hard.Â  She also put my hands through the leg part of her pants.Â  She try [sic] to put my hands inside her vagina.Â  \r\n\r\nWhen asked why he would sign a confession without reading it or having it read to him, Singletary stated he â€œdidnâ€™t really read itâ€; rather, he â€œread across [it]â€ but â€œdidnâ€™t read it word for word.â€Â  When further questioned as to whether he would be concerned about what he signed, given that he did not read its contents, Singletary said he was not worried until afterwards when the police told him that he was under arrest. \r\nConversely, the investigating police officers testified that they read Singletaryâ€™s confession back to him.Â  Moreover, they stated Singletary was allowed to read the statement, and he was in no way prohibited from altering or changing it if he wanted.Â  \r\nBased on this evidence, the jury found Singletary guilty of first degree criminal sexual misconduct with a minor, and the trial court sentenced him to ten years in prison.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSingletary argues the trial court erred when it admitted his custodial statement because it was involuntary and irrelevant.Â  We disagree.\r\nI.&nbsp; Voluntariness of the Custodial Statement \r\nSingletary first claims that his custodial statement is inadmissible because it was not freely and voluntarily given.Â  We disagree.\r\nA statement obtained as a result of custodial interrogation is inadmissible unless the person was advised of and voluntarily waived his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). Â See also Dickerson v. U.S., 530 U.S. 428 (2000).Â  The purpose of Miranda rights is to prevent government officials from using the coercive nature of confinement to extract confessions that would not be given in an unrestrained environment.Â \r\nArizona v. Mauro, 481 U.S. 520, 529-30 (1987).Â  Therefore, the State must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a statement is voluntary.Â  Lego v. Twomey, 404 U.S. 477, 486 (1972); State v. Neeley, 271 S.C. 33, 40, 244 S.E.2d 522, 526 (1978).Â  \r\nThe trial courtâ€™s determination of the voluntariness of a statement must be based on the totality of the circumstances and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion by the trial court.Â  Â State v. Rochester, 301 S.C. 196, 200, 391 S.E.2d 244, 247 (1990).Â  When reviewing a trial courtâ€™s ruling concerning voluntariness, this Court does not reevaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence, but we simply determine whether the trial courtâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence. Â State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 136, 551 S.E.2d 240, 252 (2001).\r\nThe trial court found that Singletaryâ€™s custodial statement was freely and voluntarily given, that the police afforded Singletary the proper procedural safeguards, and that Singletary knowingly and intelligently waived his rights.Â  Singletary signed both the waiver of rights form and his confession.Â  Two investigating officers, who were present during this time, corroborated that Singletary signed both forms.Â  Further, they testified that Singletary was afforded all the procedural safeguards required by law, and at no time did they prohibit Singletary from altering or changing his confession.Â  \r\nAlthough Singletary testified in court that the police did not read his Miranda rights to him and that he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his rights, there is ample evidence to the contrary.Â  Â As such, we find the trial court did not err in admitting Singletaryâ€™s \r\nstatement.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Relevance of Custodial Statement \r\nSingletary also contends that the trial court committed reversible error when it admitted his custodial statement because it was irrelevant to the crime charged.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trial court is given broad discretion in ruling on questions concerning the relevancy of evidence, and this decision will be reversed only if there is a clear abuse of discretion. Â State v. Alexander, 303 S.C. 377, 380, 401 S.E.2d 146, 148 (1991).Â  Evidence is relevant if it tends to establish or make more or less probable some matter which is in issue upon which it directly or indirectly bears.Â  State v. Schmidt, 288 S.C. 301, 303, 342 S.E.2d 401, 403 (1986).Â  A trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding the comparative probative value and prejudicial effect of evidence should be reversed only in â€œexceptional circumstances.â€ Â State v. Sweat, 362 S.C. 117, 129, 606 S.E.2d 508, 514 (Ct. App. 2004).Â Â Â  \r\nSingletary attempts to argue that the introduction of his custodial statement is prior bad act evidence as it â€œpertained to an uncharged act, and not the act described by the victim.â€ Â While prior bad act evidence is generally inadmissible because its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial impact, this statement does not fall within the ambit of a prior bad act. Â See State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 416, 118 S.E. 803, 807 (1923); Rule 404(b), SCRE (Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible to show motive, identity, the existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or intent.).Â  \r\nSingletaryâ€™s statement is sufficiently related to the charged sexual misconduct to fall within the realm of evidence that is both relevant and probative to the juryâ€™s determination of his culpability.Â  The State misspoke when, as one of several reasons for the custodial statementâ€™s relevance, it said the statement showed his â€œpropensity to engageâ€ in sexual misconduct. Â The State did not offer and the trial court did not use the statement to establish Singletaryâ€™s proclivity to commit this type of crime.Â  Rather, the statement was offered as substantive evidence of Singletaryâ€™s version of the incident.Â  While it differed from the victimâ€™s version, his custodial statement was sufficiently related to the crime charged to support the inference that Singletary committed a crime against the victim some time during the weekend of December 6th and 7th, as stated in the indictment.Â  See State v. Tufts, 355 S.C. 493, 498-99, 585 S.E.2d 523, 526 (Ct. App. 2003) (holding defendantâ€™s statement regarding his sexual desires, although not a direct acknowledgement of guilt, was properly admissible as a confession to the charge of criminal sexual conduct as defendant chose to convey his confession in that manner rather than a more traditional confession such as nodding affirmatively or recounting the entire crime).Â  \r\nMoreover, evidence is relevant if it tends to establish or make more or less probable some matter in issue upon which it directly or indirectly bears.Â  State v. Benjamin, 345 S.C. 470, 480, 549 S.E.2d 258, 264 n.8 (2001) (internal citation omitted). Â It is not required that the inference sought should necessarily follow from the fact proved. Â Id.Â  \r\nThe admission of the custodial statement was proper because it tended to make Singletaryâ€™s testimony at trial less plausible.Â  At trial, Singletary denied the sexual assault and contradicted the officersâ€™ testimony and his previous written confession.Â  As such, introduction of the custodial statement into evidence was proper for the jury to consider in determining Singletaryâ€™s veracity and ultimately his guilt.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Singletaryâ€™s custodial statement.\r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.[3]Â \r\nAnderson, Huff, and Williams, J.J., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] As stated below, Singletaryâ€™s confession and the victimâ€™s testimony conflict regarding the day and location of the sexual misconduct, which is reflected in Singletaryâ€™s indictment (charging Singletary with sexual misconduct â€œon or between December 6, 2003[] and December 7, 2003â€).Â  \r\n[2] Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r\n[3] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-419","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General David A. Spencer, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Robert M. Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â By this appeal Timothy E. Finley challenges his convictions for unlawful use of a telephone and impersonating a police officer, offenses created by S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 16-17-430, -720 (2003), respectively.Â  He does not challenge his conviction for criminal contempt.Â  The jury failed to convict Finley of unlawful use of a 911 emergency telephone system, an offense created by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-47-80 (Supp. 2005).Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFinley, a registered, licensed security guard, worked at a bowling alley in Greenville, South Carolina.Â  The series of events that led to his arrest and convictions began when his girlfriend, Maureen Charping, came to visit him at his house.Â  Because he appeared drunk and verbally abused her, Charping left and went to her parentsâ€™ home.Â  While there, Finley telephoned Charping and told her that he could hunt her down and, because of his weapons training, could kill her.Â  Finley also spoke to Charpingâ€™s father, mentioning a sniper rifle and being able to pick a person off from 250 yards.Â  The Charpings telephoned the police, who advised them to leave the house.Â  They did so and, after giving the police a statement, secured a room at a motel.\r\nFinley twice telephoned 911 operators from his residence, seeking privileged information about a possible 911 call concerning the report of a crime.Â  He claimed to be a police officer with the City of Greenville.Â  Civilians may not access information about calls made to 911 because they are deemed confidential.Â  At trial, Charping identified a voice captured on a 911 tape as Finleyâ€™s.\r\n1.Â  The denial by the trial court of Finleyâ€™s motion for a directed verdict provides no basis for a reversal of Finleyâ€™s conviction and sentence.Â  The only arguments Finley made at trial in support of his motion as it related to the charges of unlawful use of a telephone and to impersonating a police officer were that the State failed to prove identity and that Charping signed an affidavit agreeing not to prosecute Finley.Â  Here, Finley does not advance either ground as a basis on which to overturn the trial courtâ€™s ruling on his motion for a directed verdict, although he does summarily note in his brief, when arguing the State failed to prove the elements of the offense of impersonating a police officer, an argument not preserved for our review, that Charping signed an affidavit in which she stated she did not want â€œto go forward with the prosecution.â€Â  See State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1989) (noting a party cannot argue one ground for directed verdict at trial and argue another ground on appeal); State v. Russell, 345 S.C. 128, 132, 546 S.E.2d 202, 204 (Ct. App. 2001) (remarking that issues not raised to the trial judge in support of a motion for directed verdict afford no basis for appellate review); cf. State v. Jones, 344 S.C. 48, 58, 543 S.E.2d 541, 546 (2001) (finding the defendantâ€™s â€œargument is so conclusory that it has been abandonedâ€ and declining to address the merits of the issue for that reason).\r\n2.Â Â The trial court committed no abuse of discretion in having Finley removed from the courtroom for disruptive, insolent behavior, behavior that also formed the basis for his unappealed contempt conviction.Â  The trial court found Finley delayed the start of court by failing to cooperate with detention officers regarding his changing from his jail uniform into street clothes, intentionally dropped his pants in the courtroom, continued to speak to and shout down the trial court when the trial court tried to address him, kept interrupting the trial court as the trial court attempted to warn Finley that he would be ejected from the courtroom if he continued his interruptions, and resisted the officers when the trial court ordered Finley removed from the courtroom.Â  (The trial court further found Finley engaged in such loud and disruptive behavior after officers placed him in a courthouse holding cell that it necessitated his removal to another building.)Â  See State v. Logan, 279 S.C. 345, 348, 306 S.E.2d 622, 624 (1983) (holding an appellant cannot take advantage of an error he contributed to at trial); State v. Bell, 293 S.C. 391, 401, 360 S.E.2d 706, 711 (1987) (holding a defendant can waive his right to be present in the courtroom where the defendant engaged in disruptive conduct or interfered with the progress of the trial); see also North Carolina v. Rowe, 235 S.E.2d 873, 875 (N.C. Ct. App. 1977) (â€œOrdinarily the trial judge should give a defendant an opportunity to correct his conduct before removal from the courtroom.Â  Obviously, however, that can only be done if the defendant gives the trial judge a reasonable opportunity. . . . The trial judge is not . . . required to engage in a shouting contest in order to warn a defendant that he will be removed from the courtroom if he does not desist [being disruptive].â€).\r\n3.Â The trial court did not abuse its discretion by not allowing Finley to waive his right to counsel and to assert his right to represent himself.Â  Once Finleyâ€™s unruly conduct prompted the trial court to remove Finley from the courtroom, he forfeited his right to a hearing pursuant to Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975) and waived his right to represent himself.Â  See State v. Cash, 309 S.C. 40, 43, 419 S.E.2d 811, 813 (Ct. App. 1992) (holding one factor a court may consider in determining whether to allow the accused to engage in self-representation is whether the accused is attempting to delay or manipulate the proceedings); Lopez v. Delaware, 861 A.2d 1245, 1250 (Del. 2004) (finding no error in refusing the defendantâ€™s request to represent himself where he became disruptive and refused to follow the procedures for waiving his right to counsel); Connecticut v. Rose, 809 A.2d 534, 539 (Conn. App. Ct. 2002) (â€œ[I]t was the defendant himself, through his disruptive behavior, who forfeited his right to self-representation.â€).\r\n4.Â Â We need not address Finleyâ€™s complaint concerning the trial courtâ€™s charge to the jury on the elements of impersonating a law enforcement officer.Â  Finley argues â€œthe second element of the crime was not . . . properly charged by the court.â€Â  As we read section 16-17-720, the second element of the offense consists of a person â€œacting uponâ€ a â€œrepresentationâ€ that he or she is a law-enforcement officer by â€œarrest[ing] or detain[ing] any person, search[ing] any building or automobile or in any way impersonat[ing] a law-enforcement officer or act[ing] in accordance with the authority commonly given to such officers.â€Â  This issue is not preserved for appellate review, there being no objection by Finleyâ€™s counsel to the charge on this ground.Â  See Rule 20(b), SCRCrimP (â€œ[T]he parties shall be given the opportunity to object to the giving or failure to give an instruction. . . . Failure to object in accordance with this rule shall constitute a waiver of objection.â€).[2]\r\n5.Â Â We likewise find no error in the trial courtâ€™s denial of Finleyâ€™s motion to quash the indictment that accused Finley of impersonation of a law-enforcement officer in violation of section 16-17-720.Â  The indictment at issue here provided adequate notice to Finley of the offense that he was charged with because it expressly references the statute that created the offense and uses substantially the same language found in the statute.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-20 (2003); State v. Reddick, 348 S.C. 631, 560 S.E.2d 441 (Ct. App. 2002); see also State v. Owens, 346 S.C. 637, 649, 552 S.E.2d 745, 751 (2001) (holding an indictment will be deemed sufficient when it includes a statutory reference that gives notice of the elements of the offense), overruled on other grounds by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005).\r\n6.Â Â We do not address the issue raised by Finley regarding the trial courtâ€™s charge on reasonable doubt.Â  The issue is not preserved for our review, there being no objection by Finley to the charge below.Â  See Rule 20(b), SCRCrimP (stating the failure to make an objection constitutes a waiver).\r\n7.Â Â We also do not address Finleyâ€™s complaint regarding the striking by the State of three male jurors during jury selection.Â  This issue, too, is not preserved.Â  See State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 120-21, 481 S.E.2d 118, 123 (1997) (â€œAn issue may not be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).\r\n8.Â Â Finleyâ€™s claim that his counsel provided him ineffective assistance cannot be reviewed at this time and must await an application for post-conviction relief.Â  See State v. Felder, 290 S.C. 521, 351 S.E.2d 852 (1986).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, STILWELL, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Â Moreover, we note the trial court employed the language of the statute, section 16-17-720, when instructing the jury regarding the offense.Â  A charge that employs the language of the statute suffices.Â  Keel v.

Henderson, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-420\r\nSubmitted November 1, 2006 â€“ Filed December 19, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Holly Palmer Beeson, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Newton I. Howle, Jr., of Darlington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this action for reimbursement of child-related expenses, Brendalee Ables (Wife) appeals the family courtâ€™s order denying her claims for the reimbursement of medical expenses, health insurance premiums, work-related child care expenses, educational expenses, and retroactive child support.Â  Further, Wife claims the family court miscalculated its award of $300 to Wife based on improper credits previously given to Michael Gladden (Husband).Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1992, Wife and Husband divorced by order of the Tokyo Family Court, Hachiohji Chapter (divorce decree).Â  The divorce decree awarded Wife sole custody of the minor child and ordered Husband to pay child support in the amount of $842 per month from June 1992 until August 1992; $667 per month from September 1992 until Husband separated from the military; and $378 per month after Husband separated from the military. Â By 1993, Husband and Wife returned to the United States.Â  Upon return, Husband moved to North Carolina, and Wife moved to South Carolina.Â  Once in South Carolina, Wife enrolled the child in private school where she remained until graduating in 2004. Â Â \r\nIn 1994, the North Carolina General Court of Justice issued an order to modify the divorce decree.Â  This order provided that Husband pay $46 per month in child support and provide health insurance coverage for the child â€œwhen it is available at a reasonable cost.â€Â  The order further stated that â€œ[h]ealth insurance is defined to be reasonable in cost if it is employment related or other group insurance.â€Â  In addition, the order provided that Husband will be liable for any medical expenses incurred if he fails to obtain or maintain health insurance coverage as specified.Â  \r\nPrior to 1997, Husband moved to South Carolina.Â  In 1997, Wife sent a certified letter to Husband requesting payment for medical expenses, daycare expenses, and educational expenses. Â Husband signed for the letter but did not respond.Â  \r\nOn December 17, 1998, the South Carolina Department of Social Services, on behalf of Wife, filed a Notice of Registration of the Japanese Divorce Decree in the South Carolina family court, but the court held the 1994 North Carolina Order was the proper order to register in South Carolina.Â  The court also ordered Husband to pay arrears for failure to make regular payments.Â  Between the end of 1998 and 2005, the family court issued several orders relating to the payment and enforcement of child support. \r\nIn 2005, Husband filed a motion to terminate ongoing support.Â  At the March 30, 2005 hearing, Wife raised issues regarding reimbursement for medical expenses, daycare expenses, and health insurance coverage.Â  The court found the issues were not properly before it but reserved the resolution of those issues for a future hearing.Â  The court terminated ongoing child support as of March 29, 2005 due to the child turning eighteen and ordered Husband to pay arrears until paid in full.Â  \r\nOn June 22, 2005, Wife filed a complaint against Husband requesting a retroactive increase in child support for the period of time from 1994 until 2002, increased child support from 2003 through 2005 based on an alleged improper credit given to Husband, and reimbursement for medical expenses, health insurance premiums, work-related daycare expenses, and education expenses.Â  The family court: (1) denied as untimely the request for a retroactive child support increase and reimbursement for medical expenses, health insurance premiums, and work-related daycare expenses; (2) denied the request for reimbursement for education tuition as untimely because Wife failed to prove â€œextremely unusual circumstances;â€ and (3) awarded Wife $300 reimbursement for the sixty weeks Husband received improper credit for health insurance premiums.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn an action on appeal from the family court, the appellate court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Engle v. Engle, 343 S.C. 444, 448, 539 S.E.2d 712, 714 (Ct. App. 2000) (citation omitted).Â  â€œ[T]he appellate court is not, however, required to ignore the fact that the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.â€Â  Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 297, 513 S.E.2d 358, 367 (1999) (citation omitted).Â  \r\nIn general, child support awards are within the sound discretion of the trial judge, and absent an abuse of discretion, the awards will not be disturbed on appeal.Â  Mitchell v. Mitchell, 283 S.C. 87, 92, 320 S.E.2d 706, 710 (1984).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the court is controlled by some error of law or where the order, based upon findings of fact, is without evidentiary support.â€Â  Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, 485, 477 S.E.2d 727, 729 (Ct. App. 1996) (citations omitted).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical Expenses, Health Insurance Premiums, Child Care Expenses, Private School Tuition Payments, and Retroactive Child Support \r\nWife contends the family court erred in finding her claims for $8,035.14 in medical expenses and health insurance premiums, $4,502.25 in work-related child care expenses, $14,458.00 in educational expenses, and retroactive child support for the period between 1994 and 2002 were untimely.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nA claim or right may be barred as untimely when the equitable doctrine of laches applies.Â  Terry v. Lee, 314 S.C. 420, 426-27, 445 S.E.2d 435, 438 (1994).Â  Laches is defined as â€œ[n]eglect for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, under circumstances affording opportunity for diligence, to do what in law should have been done.â€Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. on Behalf of State of Tex. v. Holden, 319 S.C. 72, 75, 459 S.E.2d 846, 848 (1995).Â  â€œWhether a claim is barred by laches is to be determined in light of the facts of each case, taking into consideration whether the delay has worked injury, prejudice, or disadvantage to the other party; delay alone in assertion of a right does not constitute laches.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nâ€œThe party seeking to establish laches must show (1) delay, (2) unreasonable delay, and (3) prejudice.â€Â  Emery v. Smith, 361 S.C. 207, 215, 603 S.E.2d 598, 602 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Generally, the inquiry into the applicability of laches is highly fact-specific; thus, the determination of whether a party has established laches is largely within the discretion of the trial court. Â Id. at 216, 603 S.E.2d at 602.\r\nWe hold the record supports the family courtâ€™s decision that laches bars Wifeâ€™s claims.Â  First, the evidence demonstrates that Wife delayed in asserting her rights.Â  Wife failed to bring any formal adjudicatory proceeding against Husband until 2005, despite believing Husband was responsible for expenses and support since 1994.Â  See Hallums v. Hallums, 296 S.C. 195, 199, 371 S.E.2d 525, 528 (1988) (finding delay when mother had sixteen years during which she could have enforced her right to have the father support their child).Â  \r\nSecond, Wifeâ€™s delay was unreasonable.Â  Despite Wifeâ€™s contention that Husband was difficult to locate, the evidence shows Husband was readily accessible.Â  For example, Wife sent Husband a certified letter in 1997, indicating her knowledge of his residence. Â Furthermore, Wife and Husband were involved in multiple court proceedings between 1999 and 2005 regarding issues surrounding Husbandâ€™s child support payments.Â  See id. (finding delay unreasonable when mother was afforded numerous earlier opportunities to enforce child support obligation).Â  \r\nFinally, the evidence shows Husband would be prejudiced by the unreasonable delay.Â  Wife is claiming reimbursement for expenses totaling $26,995.39 in addition to retroactive child support for 1994 through 2002.Â  In this situation, the substantial burden of paying such a large amount would prejudice Husband.Â  See id. at 200, 371 S.E.2d at 528 (finding prejudice when husband may be subjected to burden of paying large sum).Â  Therefore, we find the family court did not err in holding laches bars Wifeâ€™s claim for reimbursements for expenses and a retroactive child support increase.\r\nWe note prejudice may not always arise when one owes a large sum to another.Â  See, e.g., Holden, 319 S.C. at 76, 459 S.E.2d at 848 (holding no prejudice shown when court ordered father to repay the arrearages at the modest rate of $25 per month, rather than in a lump sum).Â  However, we reiterate the fact-specific nature of the application of laches.Â  Emery, 361 S.C. at 216, 603 S.E.2d at 602.Â  While the appellate courtâ€™s deference to the family court is not absolute, under the facts of this case, the family courtâ€™s findings are entitled to deference by this Court.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calculation of Credit\r\nWife asserts the family court erred by considering an improper credit Husband received for health insurance premiums he never paid.Â  Specifically, Wife argues she is entitled to an award in the amount of $660 as opposed to $300 the family court awarded Wife.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn computing health insurance coverage for children in a child support award, the family court should reference the South Carolina Child Support Guidelines (the Guidelines).Â  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4710(A), 114-4720(G) (Supp. 2005).Â  \r\nIn this case, Wife requested that she be paid $660.Â  This amount represents what Husband would have actually paid for the health insurance without reference to either the Guidelines or the pro rata responsibility of the parties in making the calculation.Â  To determine what Husband should pay Wife, the family court calculated child support without including the cost of insurance pursuant to the Guidelines, which resulted in a weekly child support amount of $67.Â  Because the family courtâ€™s original weekly child support order of $62 included the cost of insurance pursuant to the Guidelines, Husband underpaid Wife $5 per week over sixty weeks.Â  As such, the family court correctly ordered the $5 difference to be reimbursed to Wife for the sixty weeks that Husband underpaid the support, which amounted to a total of $300.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we hold the family court did not err in determining that laches bars Wifeâ€™s claims for medical expenses, health insurance premiums, work-related child care expenses, educational expenses, and retroactive child support.Â  We further hold the family court did not err in calculating Wifeâ€™s award for the improper credit Husband received.Â  The family courtâ€™s decision is accordingly \r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-421","title":"Holliday v.

Tunstall, Jr., Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-421\r\nSubmitted November 1, 2006 â€“ Filed December 19, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Joseph M. Ramseur, Jr. of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n        Tiffiny M. Holliday, of Green Cove Springs, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: James Holliday appeals a family court custody order denying that a sufficient change of circumstances resulted from Tiffiny and Justin Hollidayâ€™s relocation to Florida.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nJames (Father) and Tiffiny (Mother) Holliday married on May 10, 1997.Â  They have one son together, Justin (Child), who was born February 5, 1998.Â  Father and Mother separated on April 1, 2000 and entered into a custody agreement, which the family court approved on August 9, 2001. Â That order provided that Father and Mother would share joint custody, with Child living with Mother and Father receiving â€œstandard visitation.â€ Â Father and Mother divorced on June 12, 2003.Â  The divorce order incorporated the prior custody order. \r\nOn June 2, 2004, Mother and Child moved from their home in Gray Court, South Carolina, to Greencove Springs, Florida. Â On August 5, 2004, in response to Motherâ€™s relocation, Father filed a motion for temporary custody. Â The South Carolina Family Court heard the motion, and on November 3, 2004, the court filed an order granting Father temporary custody of Child.Â  \r\nAfter the final hearing, the family court issued its final custody order on July 13, 2005.Â  In that order, the family court found Father failed to show a change in circumstances that would warrant the courtâ€™s alteration of custody from the original agreement. Â Consequently, both parents retained joint custody with Child living with Mother in Florida.Â  \r\nThereafter, Father filed a motion to reconsider, which the court denied.Â  Father timely filed a notice to appeal.Â  Later, Father filed a Rule 60(b)(2) SCRCP Â motion, asking for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. Â At the hearing, Father attempted to show that Mother began living with a man to whom she was not married and had exposed Child to the man on an overnight basis.Â  Father also claimed Child was left at home with the man, and even left at home alone without adult supervision, while mother went to work.Â  The family court denied that motion on November 22, 2005.Â  By order dated January 3, 2006, Fatherâ€™s appeals were consolidated.Â  Father now appeals both the final custody order from July 13, 2005 and the November 22, 2005 order denying a new trial.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen a family court order is appealed, we have jurisdiction to find facts based on our own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Â We are not required to disregard the findings of the trial judge who saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position to evaluate their credibility. Â Strout v. Strout, 284 S.C. 429, 327 S.E.2d 74 (1985). Â This degree of deference is especially true in cases involving the welfare and best interests of the child. Dixon v. Dixon, 336 S.C. 260, 263, 519 S.E.2d 357, 359 (Ct. App. 1999). Â Our broad scope of review does not relieve the appealing party of the burden of showing the family court committed error. Â Skinner v. King, 272 S.C. 520, 252 S.E.2d 891 (1979).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n    I. Custody\r\nFather argues the family court erred in finding Motherâ€™s relocation to Florida with Child was not a substantial change of circumstances when Father and Mother shared joint custody and Father objected to the relocation.Â  Father also claims error in the family courtâ€™s finding that the relocation was in Childâ€™s best interests.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n  The change of circumstances relied on for a change of custody must be such as would substantially affect the interests and welfare of the child. Â Because the best interest[s] of the child is the overriding concern in all child custody matters, when a non-custodial parent seeks a change in custody, the non-custodial parent must establish the following: (1) there has been a substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child and (2) a change in custody is in the overall best interests of the child. \r\n\r\nLatimer v. Farmer, 360 S.C. 375, 381, 602 S.E.2d 32, 35 (2004).Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court declined to hold relocation in itself is a substantial change in circumstance affecting the welfare of a child. Â Relocation is one factor in considering a change in circumstances but is not alone a sufficient change in circumstances. Â One location may not necessarily affect the best interests of the child as would another. Â The effect of relocation on the childâ€™s best interests is highly fact specific. Â It should not be assumed that merely relocating and potentially burdening the non-custodial parentâ€™s visitation rights always negatively affects the childâ€™s best interests.Â  Id.\r\nFather cites Section 20-7-100 of the South Carolina Code (1976) to support his position.Â  This section states that the mother and father â€œare equally charged with the welfare and education of their minor children[,] . . . and neither parent has any right paramount to the right of the other concerning . . . any . . . matter affecting the minor.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-100.Â  There is abundant case law affirming the custodial parentâ€™s right to move to another state against the wishes of the non-custodial parent.Â  Â­See, eg, Hollar v. Hollar, 342 S.C. 463, 536 S.E.2d 883 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nHere, the court realized that relocation cases are highly fact specific and considered the following factors in determining whether Childâ€™s best interests were served by the move: (a) the potential advantages of the move; (b) the likelihood the move will improve the quality of life for Mother and Child; (c) that the move was not the result of a whim; (d) the integrity of the motives of both parents in seeking the move or seeking to prevent it; and (e) the availability of realistic visitation arrangements that will adequately foster an ongoing relationship between Father and Child.Â  Upon a review of the record, we find that the family courtâ€™s decision was supported by a preponderance of the evidence, and Father has not met his burden of showing otherwise.\r\nII. New Trial Motion\r\nFather argues the family court erred in refusing to grant a new trial based on newly discovered evidence of Motherâ€™s exposing Child to Motherâ€™s boyfriend overnight.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo obtain a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, the moving party must establish the new evidence: (a) will probably change the result if a new trial is granted; (b) has been discovered since the trial; (c) could not have been discovered before the trial; (d) is material to the issue; and (e) is not merely cumulative or impeaching.Â  Lanier v. Lanier, 364 S.C. 211, 217, 612 S.E.2d 456, 459 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nThe family court denied Fatherâ€™s motion for a new trial, in part because Father conceded there was no evidence presented to prove that the boyfriend was living with Mother at the time of the hearing. Â Also, Father conceded if the boyfriend was living with Mother prior to the hearing, Father could have discovered this fact at that time. Â The family court further stated that even if the court took Fatherâ€™s allegations as true, Father did not provide the court with evidence to show that a new trial would probably result in a different outcome. Â Upon a review of the record, we find the family courtâ€™s ruling is supported by a preponderance of the evidence.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the family courtâ€™s decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nHEARN, C.J., WILLIAMS, J., and CURETON A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-422","title":"Gaither v.

Gaither, III (Husband) appeals the family courtâ€™s order concerning the identification of certain real property as marital property and the award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Cathryn G. Gaither (Wife).Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. [1]\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were married on May 8, 1999, in Gatlinburg, Tennessee and resided in Horry County, South Carolina.Â  The parties separated on May 15, 2003.Â  After the separation, Husband relocated to Cashiers, North Carolina, while the Wife remained in Horry County. \r\nOn May 16, 2003, Wife filed for divorce on the ground of adultery.Â  Pursuant to her complaint and amended complaint, Wife sought a divorce, separate support and maintenance, alimony, equitable division of the marital assets and debts, discovery, restraining orders, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Husband filed an answer and counterclaim, seeking separate support and maintenance, equitable division of the marital assets and debts, restraining orders, discovery, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Â Â \r\nAfter a hearing, during which Husband appeared pro se, the family court issued its order in which it:Â  (1) denied Wifeâ€™s request for a divorce on the ground of adultery; (2) denied Wifeâ€™s request for alimony; (3) equitably apportioned the marital property; and (4) awarded Wife partial attorneyâ€™s fees in the amount of $16,000. Â The court specifically found that neither party had any nonmarital property of any significant value.Â  In terms of the real property comprising part of the marital estate, the court found the total equity to be valued at $882,000.Â  This valuation consisted of five pieces of real estate, which included property in Myrtle Beach located at 400 and 402 29th Avenue North and 5405 North Ocean Boulevard.Â  In determining each partyâ€™s percentage of the real property, the court found the â€œmajority of the real property was acquired through [Husbandâ€™s] inherited funds; and, thus, the property shall be divided on a 67/33% basis with the [Husband] receiving 67% and the [Wife] receiving 33%.â€Â  As a result, the court valued Wifeâ€™s share to be $291,060.Â  To effectuate this division, the court awarded Wife a lot on Lake Keowee, which was valued at $12,000, and ordered Husband to pay $279,060 to Wife within six months of the date of the order.Â  Husband filed a motion and an amended motion to reconsider pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  After the court denied the motion, Husband filed this appeal.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has authority to find the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996). Â However, â€œ[b]ecause the family court is in a superior position to judge the witnessesâ€™ demeanor and veracity, its findings should be given broad discretion.â€Â  Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  Equitable Apportionment\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in including in the marital estate the Myrtle Beach property located at 400 and 402 29th Avenue North and 5405 North Ocean Boulevard.Â  He contends, as will more fully be discussed, this property constituted nonmarital property.Â  \r\n In making an equitable distribution of marital property, the court must (1) identify the marital property, both real and personal, to be divided between the parties; (2) determine the fair market value of the identified property; (3) apportion the marital estate according to the contributions, both direct and indirect, of each party to the acquisition of the property during the marriage, their respective assets and incomes, and any special equities they may have in marital assets; and (4) provide for an equitable division of the marital estate, including the manner in which the distribution is to take place.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 293, 372 S.E.2d 107, 110 (Ct. App. 1988). \r\nMarital property is defined as â€œall real and personal property acquired by the parties during the marriage which is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of the marital litigation, regardless of how legal title is held.â€Â  Johnson, 296 S.C. at 294, 372 S.E.2d at 110; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2005).Â  Property acquired prior to the marriage is generally considered nonmarital. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473(2) (Supp. 2005); see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473(1) (Supp. 2005) (stating property is considered nonmarital if it is acquired by gift or inheritance). Â â€œProperty acquired during the marriage in exchange for property acquired before the marriage is also nonmarital property.Â  Likewise, any increase in the value of nonmarital property during the marriage is nonmarital property, except to the extent the increase resulted directly or indirectly from the efforts of the other spouse during the marriage.â€Â  Johnson, 296 S.C. at 294, 372 S.E.2d at 110 (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473(3), (5) (1976)).Â  \r\nâ€œ[N]onmarital property may be transmuted into marital property if: (1) it becomes so commingled with marital property as to be untraceable; (2) it is jointly titled; or (3) it is utilized by the parties in support of the marriage or in some other manner so as to evidence an intent by the parties to make it marital property.â€Â  Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 98, 545 S.E.2d 531, 537 (Ct. App. 2001). Â â€œTransmutation is a matter of intent to be gleaned from the facts of each case.â€ Id. Â The burden is on the spouse claiming transmutation to produce objective evidence that the parties considered the property to be marital during the marriage. Id.Â  The spouse claiming an equitable interest in property upon dissolution of the marriage has the burden of proving that the property is part of the marital estate. Â If the spouse carries this burden, he or she establishes a prima facie case that the property is marital property. Â If the opposing spouse then wishes to claim the property so identified is not part of the marital estate, he or she has the burden of presenting evidence to establish its nonmarital character. Â Johnson, 296 S.C. at 294, 372 S.E.2d at 110.\r\nA.\r\nTurning to the facts of the instant case, we initially note that Husband does not challenge the percentage of the marital estate awarded to him.Â  Instead, he only asserts the court erred in including certain real property in the marital estate.Â  Thus, we confine our analysis to determine whether the family court properly identified this real estate as constituting marital property.\r\nBecause the Myrtle Beach property located at 400 and 402 29th Avenue North was purchased by Husband prior to the marriage, Husband argues it constituted nonmarital property given there was no evidence the property had been transmuted to marital property.Â  Specifically, he asserts Wife did not â€œhelp preserve and appreciate the property.â€Â  Even if the property appreciated in value and provided income for the parties during the marriage, Husband claims these facts alone were not sufficient to transmute the property to marital property.Â  Essentially, Husband argues Wife failed to present any evidence to establish that the parties intended to transmute the property.Â  We agree with Husband.\r\nHusband consistently maintained that this property was nonmarital and retained its separate, nonmarital nature throughout the marriage.Â  Through his testimony and submitted documentation, Husband established that he and his father purchased this property in June of 1997, prior to the marriage, and that he inherited his fatherâ€™s interest when he passed away in September of 1999.Â  At trial, Wife also acknowledged that Husband purchased the property prior to the marriage. Â Therefore, it was incumbent upon Wife to establish the property was transmuted.Â  We find she failed to meet this burden.\r\nAlthough on direct examination Wife claimed to have helped manage and maintain the apartments located on 400 and 402 29th Avenue North, she admitted during cross-examination that she: (1) did not sign any of the loan applications used to finance the renovations of the apartments; (2) was not involved in designing the renovations; and (3) did not contribute any physical labor to the addition of the apartments to the property.Â  Furthermore, we find unpersuasive Wifeâ€™s claim that the parties evidenced an intent to transmute the property given the apartments located on the property â€œwere an integral part of the business of the marriage, buying[,] building, renovating and selling property.â€ Â We do not believe Wifeâ€™s mere assertion constitutes sufficient objective evidence that the parties considered the property to be marital during the marriage.Â  Moreover, the partiesâ€™ use of the income derived from the property during their relatively short-term marriage did not transmute it to marital property.Â  See Peterkin v. Peterkin, 293 S.C. 311, 313, 360 S.E.2d 311, 313 (1987) (â€œMerely using the income derived from [non-marital assets] in support of the marriage does not transmute them into marital property.â€); Brooks v. Brooks, 289 S.C. 352, 355, 345 S.E.2d 510, 512 (Ct. App. 1986) (holding inherited property did not lose its separate nature because a portion of the inheritance was used in furtherance of the marriage).\r\nFinally, we find Wifeâ€™s reliance on this courtâ€™s decision in Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 545 S.E.2d 531 (Ct. App. 2001), to be misplaced.Â  In Jenkins, Husband challenged several rulings of the family court, including the courtâ€™s finding that a farm and rental home that he had acquired from his mother were marital property subject to equitable distribution.Â  In reaching this decision, the family court found the parties used the farm as a second home and planned to make the farm their primary residence after Husband retired.Â  Through Husbandâ€™s direct financial contributions, the parties spent a significant amount of money making improvements on the property.Â  Wife was primarily responsible for the general care and maintenance of the property for approximately eight years. Â Additionally, Husband executed a will in which he left all of his property, including the farm and rental home to Wife.Â  Unlike the parties in Jenkins, the parties in the instant action did not affirmatively express an intention to transmute the property to marital property.Â  Although Wife may have contributed to the maintenance of the property, she did not present evidence of any significant personal or financial contribution.Â  Moreover, Husband did not jointly title the property or execute any documents indicating his intention to establish it as a marital asset.Â  Accordingly, we find the family court erred in including the property located at 400 and 402 29th Avenue North as part of the marital estate. Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nB.\r\nAdditionally, Husband challenges the courtâ€™s decision to include property located at 5405 North Ocean Boulevard in the marital estate.Â  Husband acknowledges the property was purchased during the marriage, and thus â€œby strict definitionâ€ was marital property.Â  He contends, however, it constituted a nonmarital asset because it was purchased by Husband with loan proceeds derived from equity in a home he inherited from his father.Â  Husband in essence characterizes this transaction as simply a substitution of one nonmarital asset for another.Â  Â \r\nAlthough Husband is correct that property acquired during the marriage in exchange for property acquired before the marriage is nonmarital property, we find Husband failed to produce evidence establishing such with respect to 5405 North Ocean Boulevard.Â  Given the property was purchased during the marriage, Wife, in claiming an interest in the property, established a prima facie case that the property was marital.Â  Thus, the burden was on Husband to present evidence to establish its nonmarital character.Â  Johnson, 296 S.C. at 294, 372 S.E.2d at 110.Â  \r\nBased on our review of the record, we find Husband failed to carry his burden.Â  At trial, Husband testified that he purchased the property at issue by using as collateral a piece of inherited property located at 318 Wild Wood Dunes in Myrtle Beach.Â  Through his cross-examination of Husband, Wifeâ€™s counsel asserted that the 5405 North Ocean Boulevard property was in fact the collateral for the property purchase.Â  In support of this assertion, counsel indicated that the United States Housing and Urban Development (HUD) statement reflected that 5405 North Ocean Boulevard was valued at $295,000 and Husband used the purchase property as collateral for the $300,000 property loan. Â Counsel attempted to establish that Husband did not use â€œoutsideâ€ or nonmarital, inherited funds to purchase the property.Â  Husband disputed this assertion.Â  Husband, however, was unable to substantiate his claim because he had failed to submit the necessary documents during pre-trial discovery.Â  We would also note there is no indication in the record that Husband attempted to proffer these documents nor does Husband raise any argument regarding the denial of a proffer.Â  Thus, our determination of this issue is limited by the record before us.Â  Besides Husbandâ€™s testimony and his financial declaration, there is no other evidence in the record to support Husbandâ€™s contention.Â  Accordingly, we conclude Husbandâ€™s testimony was not sufficient to establish the property in question was nonmarital.Â  \r\nBecause Husband failed to produce evidence to rebut the prima facie case that 5405 North Ocean Boulevard was marital, we hold the family court did not err by including this piece of property in the marital estate.Â  Therefore, we affirm the family courtâ€™s finding that 5405 North Ocean Boulevard was a marital asset subject to equitable division.Â  See Fuller v. Fuller, No. 4150, 2006 WL 2623194, at *7 (S.C. Ct. App. Sept. 11, 2006)(affirming family courtâ€™s finding that company started during the partiesâ€™ marriage constituted marital property where Husband did not produce evidence to rebut presumption that it was marital).\r\nII.&nbsp;Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nHusband contends the family court erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife in the amount of $16,000 given: Â (1) the court failed to make specific findings in support of the award pursuant to Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403 S.E.2d 313 (1991); (2) Wife did not achieve sufficient beneficial results to be entitled to an award; and (3) the amount of the award was excessive.Â  \r\nThe family court may order payment of attorneyâ€™s fees to a party pursuant to statute. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(H) (Supp. 2005).Â  An award of attorneyâ€™s fees lies within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 533, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004).\r\nIn deciding whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court should consider: Â (1) each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fees; (2) the beneficial results obtained by counsel; (3) the respective financial condition of each party; and (4) the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  Upchurch v. Upchurch, 367 S.C. 16, 28, 624 S.E.2d 643, 648-49 (2006).Â  Â Â When determining the reasonable amount of fees to award, the court must consider the nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered, the time necessarily devoted to the case, counselâ€™s professional standing, the contingency of compensation, the beneficial results obtained, and the customary legal fees for similar services. Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).\r\nIn view of our decision to reverse a substantive result achieved by wife regarding the identification of marital property, we also reverse the award of attorneyâ€™s fees and remand this issue for reconsideration.Â  See Sexton v. Sexton, 310 S.C. 501, 503, 427 S.E.2d 665, 666 (1993) (reversing and remanding issue of attorneyâ€™s fees for reconsideration where the substantive results achieved by trial counsel were reversed on appeal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we affirm the decision of the family court with respect to the inclusion of 5405 North Ocean Boulevard in the marital estate.Â  We reverse, however, the family courtâ€™s finding that the property located at 400 and 402 29th Avenue North was marital property.Â  In light of our disposition, we reverse and remand for the family court to redetermine the valuation of the marital estate and to reconsider Wifeâ€™s entitlement to attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND Â Â Â Â Â  REMANDED.\r\nBEATTY and SHORT, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-423","title":"South Carolina Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company v.

Saunders, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-423\r\nHeard September 14, 2006 â€“ Filed December 19, 2006\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Karl Stephen Brehmer, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Eric H. Philpot, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â Â Â  In this declaratory judgment action, South Carolina Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company (Farm Bureau) sought a determination as to whether Henry Kennedy is entitled to underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage under his employerâ€™s insurance policy.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment to Kennedy, and Farm Bureau appeals.Â  Farm Bureau argues there is a genuine issue of material fact, or in the alternative, the trial court erred in its interpretation of the policy.Â  We reverse.Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn October 2002, Kennedy was employed with Irons Poultry Farm.Â  At the direction of his employer, Kennedy drove a company manure truck to Wise Barbeque on October 23 to inform Jimmy Wise, the owner of Wise Barbeque, that he could pick up some contaminated chicken feed at his convenience.Â  Kennedy completed his errand and then went to speak with his half-brother, Teddy Robinson, who was employed with Wise Barbeque.Â  Kennedy and Robinson spoke for a few minutes and then walked to the parking lot.Â  Kennedy and Robinson stopped near the rear of the manure truck and briefly continued their conversation.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nMoments later, on an adjacent highway, an accident occurred between a pickup truck driven by George Counts and another pickup truck. Â The impact from the collision caused Countsâ€™ truck to careen into Wiseâ€™s parking lot.Â  Kennedy and Robinson were both struck by Countsâ€™ truck.Â  \r\nAs a result of the accident, Kennedy sustained damages in excess of $64,000.Â  Kennedy settled with Countsâ€™ liability carrier for $50,000 on a Covenant Not to Execute.Â  Kennedy then made a demand for the full amount of UIM coverage available on the manure truckâ€™s insurance policy.Â  The manure truck was owned by Irons Poultry Farm and insured by Farm Bureau with UIM coverage in the amount of $50,000 per individual and $100,000 per occurrence.Â  The Farm Bureau policy provides, in relevant part: \r\n\r\n  [Farm Bureau] will pay damages for bodily injury or property damage a covered person is legally entitled to collect from the owner or operator of an underinsured motor vehicle.Â  The bodily injury or property damage must be caused by an accident arising out of the operation or ownership of the underinsured motor vehicle.Â  \r\n\r\nA â€œcovered personâ€ includes a â€œperson occupying [the insuredâ€™s] covered auto.â€Â  â€œOccupyingâ€ is defined as â€œhaving actual physical contact with an auto while in, upon, entering, or alighting from it.â€Â Â  \r\nFarm Bureau denied coverage and filed a declaratory judgment action asking the court to determine whether UIM coverage was available to Kennedy under the terms of the insurance policy.Â  Kennedy subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nAt the hearing, the parties submitted affidavits, deposition testimony, and other evidence to support their respective positions.Â  Kennedy argued he was entitled to coverage because the evidence conclusively proves he was pinned between the manure truck and Countsâ€™ truck, and therefore, established he was â€œuponâ€ the truck.Â  Farm Bureau alleged a factual dispute exists as to whether Kennedy was actually pinned and, alternatively, that being pinned does not qualify as â€œuponâ€ in South Carolina. Â Â Â \r\nThe trial court found Farm Bureau â€œpresented no evidence to dispute the fact [Kennedy] was pinned against the manure truck and . . . did not meet the scintilla of the evidence burden to make this a genuine issue of material fact.â€ Â The trial court then held Kennedy was â€œuponâ€ the manure truck based on the current law in South Carolina and, thus qualifies as an insured.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFarm Bureau asserts the trial court erred in granting Kennedyâ€™s motion for summary judgment because there is a genuine issue of fact as to whether Kennedy was knocked or pinned against the manure truck.Â  We agree.\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard applied by the trial court.Â  Redwend, Ltd. Pâ€™ship v. Edwards, 354 S.C. 459, 467, 581 S.E.2d 496, 500-01 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Jackson v. Swordfish Invs., L.L.C., 365 S.C. 608, 611, 620 S.E.2d 54, 55 (2005).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Cunningham v. Helping Hands, Inc., 352 S.C. 485, 491, 575 S.E.2d 549, 552 (2003).Â Â  Â Â Â \r\nâ€œThe party seeking summary judgment has the burden of clearly establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.â€ Â Mulherin-Howell v. Cobb, 362 S.C. 588, 596, 608 S.E.2d 587, 592 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Â â€œOnce the party moving for summary judgment meets the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary support for the opponentâ€™s case, the opponent cannot simply rest on mere allegations or denials contained in the pleadings.â€Â  Wogan v. Kunze, 366 S.C. 583, 591, 623 S.E.2d 107, 112 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  â€œRather, the nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.â€Â  Id.\r\nAt the summary judgment hearing, Kennedy presented affidavits and deposition testimony from numerous people indicating Kennedy was either pinned or knocked against the manure truck.Â  Ronald Long witnessed the accident, and his affidavit provides that â€œKennedy was pinned between the red truck and the rear driverâ€™s side of the dump truck.â€ Â James Wise also observed the accident; his affidavit states Countsâ€™ truck â€œknocked [Kennedy] into the back of the manure truck, pinning him between Mr. Countsâ€™ truck and the manure truck,â€ and then â€œCountsâ€™ truck bounced back and [Kennedy] fell to the ground several feet behind the manure truck.â€Â  Kennedy testified he â€œgot pinnedâ€ between the two trucks, and Countsâ€™ truck stopped far â€œenough for me to free my leg.â€ \r\nOn the other hand, Farm Bureau presented sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether Kennedy was either pinned or knocked against the manure truck from the testimony of Robinson, Counts, and the investigating officer, Earl Gentry.Â  Robinson testified that immediately following the accident, he observed Kennedy on the ground next to where Robinson came to rest and was unable to say if Kennedy was pinned.Â  Additionally, Counts testified that immediately after his truck came to rest, Kennedy and Robinson â€œwere both laying right there on the ground.â€Â  Counts also stated he had no knowledge as to whether Kennedy was pinned to the manure truck.Â  Lastly, in direct opposition to Kennedyâ€™s claim that he was pinned to the manure truck by the passenger side of Countsâ€™ vehicle, Counts testified that he could not â€œsee how the passenger side could have [pinned Kennedy], because it was coming around the opposite way. . . .â€ \r\nMoreover, Gentryâ€™s testimony also disputed the fact Kennedy was pinned to the truck.Â  Importantly, Gentry testified no one at the scene told him the manure truck had anything to do with the accident or that Kennedy hit the manure truck.Â  Gentry also testified that based on the fact he observed no physical damage to the manure truck he saw no evidence that the manure truck was involved in the accident.Â  Lastly, Kennedy was on the ground â€œprobably ten to fifteenâ€ feet from the manure truck when he arrived on the scene.[1]Â  As a result, Gentry did not include the manure truck in the accident report.Â  Thus, Gentryâ€™s testimony provided reasonable inferences that Kennedy was not pinned or knocked against the truck.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Farm Bureau, we find the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom create a genuine issue of fact as to whether Kennedy was pinned or knocked against the manure truck.Â  Therefore, the order of the trial court granting summary judgment is hereby\r\nREVERSED.[2]\r\nSTILWELL and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â The picture of the scene taken by the Newberry Observer supports Gentryâ€™s testimony.Â  The picture, which was admitted at the hearing, shows Kennedy injured on the ground some distance from both the manure truck and Countsâ€™ vehicle. \r\n[2] Â In light of our reversal of the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment, we need not address Farm Bureauâ€™s remaining arguments.Â  See Whiteside v.

Goldsmith, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-424\r\nSubmitted November 1, 2006 â€“ Filed December 19, 2006Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Marvin P. Jackson, of Florence, for Appellant.\r\n        John S. Wilkerson and M. Scott Taylor, both of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â The trial court granted William R. Tillman, Dan L. Tillman &amp; Sons Inc.â€™s (collectively â€œTillmanâ€) motion for a directed verdict on Hattie Gordonâ€™s (â€œGordonâ€) cause of action for fraud and deceit in connection with the sale and purchase of Gordonâ€™s home.Â  The trial court also excluded Gordonâ€™s testimony relating to rent she paid after vacating her home.Â  Gordon now appeals the trial courtâ€™s rulings.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn March 2002, approximately one year after moving to Wallace, South Carolina, Gordon decided to purchase a house.Â  She contacted three real estate agents, but only Tillman had an available listing in the area.Â  After looking at the house on her own, Gordon met Tillman at the house to conduct a formal walk-through. \r\nGordon testified that during the walk-through, she told Tillman she wanted the â€œhome inspectedâ€ but admitted that she did not explicitly request a formal inspection from Tillman.Â  In response to her statements at the walk-through, Gordon testified Tillman told her a house inspection was part of the loan process and was a prerequisite to close the loan.Â  Further, Gordon said Tillman told her the house was a â€œfine home,â€ and nothing was wrong with the house.Â  Despite Gordonâ€™s testimony, a written phone message indicated that Gordon called Tillmanâ€™s office after the walk-through to request a key because she â€œha[d] someone to do a home inspection.â€Â  \r\nOn March 22, 2002, Gordon placed an offer on the house.Â  Before closing, Tillman told Gordon he was exclusively the sellerâ€™s agent and presented Gordon with a form entitled â€œAcknowledgement of Relationship Disclosure,â€ which she signed.Â  The disclosure stated she understood the terms and agreed to be self-represented, and at no time would Tillman act as a dual agent between Gordon and the seller.Â Â  \r\nAfter negotiations on the price, both seller and Gordon signed a purchase contract for $62,000, which placed the responsibility to inspect the house on Gordon and required her to notify the seller of any necessary repairs within fourteen days of both parties signing the purchase contract.Â  Specifically, the contract stated:\r\n\r\n  (B) Buyer at Buyerâ€™s expense shall have the privilege and responsibility of inspecting the structure, square footage, environmental concerns including but not limited to radon gas, wetlands study, appurtenant buildings, heating, air conditioning, electrical and plumbing systems as well as built-in appurtenant equipment or appliances prior to the day of closing or possession.Â  In the event repairs are necessary to place the heating system, air conditioning, plumbing, electrical system, and any appliances to be conveyed in operative condition and to make the roof free of leaks and the dwelling structurally sound, the Seller shall be notified within 14 days after both parties have signed this Agreement. \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Gordon admitted that she both read and understood this provision.Â  In addition, Gordon acknowledged that the seller did not charge her for a home inspection on the settlement statement.Â  \r\nBesides placing the responsibility on the buyer to inspect the home for defects, the contract also included a disclaimer provision.\r\n\r\n  DISCLAIMER BY BROKERS AND AGENTS: The parties acknowledge that the Listing and Cooperating Broker(s) and their Agent(s): (1) Give no guaranty or warranty of any kind, express or implied, as to the physical condition of the property or as to the condition of or existence of improvement services or systems, thereto, included but not limited to termite damage, roof, basement, appliances, heating and air conditioning systems, plumbing, sewage, electric systems, and to the structure; (2) give no warranty, express or implied, as to the merchantability of fitness for a particular purpose as to the property or such improvements thereto and any implied warranty hereby disclaimed; . . . (4) Give no guaranty or warranty concerning (a) any certification or inspection concerning the condition of the property . . . . \r\n\r\nDespite this disclaimer provision, Gordon claimed from her prior conversations with Tillman, she believed a home inspection would be conducted on her behalf.Â  While no inspection was arranged explicitly for Gordon, Orkin Pest Control did conduct an inspection to issue the CL-100 termite and moisture report on the house pursuant to the terms of the purchase contract.[1]Â  Gordon maintains the closing attorney presented her only the first page of the report at the closing and claims her signature on the second page of the termite report is a forgery. \r\nAfter moving into the house, Gordon testified to a litany of problems, the majority of which she denied discovering before purchasing the house.Â  Furthermore, many of these problems, which Gordon included in her damages testimony, were also items she conceded would not be within the scope of a home inspection (i.e. lack of insulation in walls; lack of sub-flooring; cracks in ceilings and walls that developed post-purchase; and replacement of dirty carpet). \r\nWhile Gordon attempted to undertake some minor repairs, by January of 2004, she contacted R.T. Teal to remodel the house.Â  Teal estimated it would cost approximately $60,000 to repair the house, but Teal included no specific itemizations to explain how he arrived at the $60,000 figure. \r\nFurthermore, Tealâ€™s estimate encompasses a complete and total renovation of the house.Â  The estimate includes, inter alia, replacing all plumbing because the pipes were rusty; tearing down an addition and rear deck; installing new concrete footings for foundational support; replacing the stove range hood, kitchen cabinets, and counter tops; upgrading the electrical panel box; and replacing the baseboard heater with a new unit because of its increased efficiency.Â  Gordon apparently never hired Teal to complete these renovations.Â  By April of 2004, Gordon permanently vacated her house claiming the heat was not working properly. \r\nGordon subsequently filed suit against several parties, including Tillman, but only Tillmanâ€™s case failed to settle.Â  Prior to trial, the circuit court heard Tillmanâ€™s motion for summary judgment and granted Tillmanâ€™s motion as to all causes of action except Gordonâ€™s claim for fraud.Â  Gordon did not appeal the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment.Â  After Gordonâ€™s presentation of evidence, Tillman moved for a directed verdict on the fraud claim.Â  The circuit court granted Tillmanâ€™s motion for directed verdict.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen ruling on directed verdict or JNOV motions, the circuit court must view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Sabb v. S.C. State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).Â  If the evidence as a whole is susceptible to more than one reasonable inference, a jury issue is created, and the motion should be denied.Â  Adams v. G.J. Creel &amp; Sons, Inc., 320 S.C. 274, 277, 465 S.E.2d 84, 85 (1995); Bailey v. Segars, 346 S.C. 359, 365, 550 S.E.2d 910, 913 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  However, this rule does not authorize submission of speculative, theoretical, and hypothetical views to the jury.Â  Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 149, 485 S.E.2d 903, 908 (1997).Â  \r\nIn reviewing a grant of a directed verdict, the appellate court should not ignore facts unfavorable to the opposing party.Â  Collins v. Bisson Moving &amp; Storage, Inc., 332 S.C. 290, 296, 504 S.E.2d 347, 350 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  In essence, the court must determine whether a verdict for the opposing party would be reasonably possible under the facts as liberally construed in the partyâ€™s favor.Â  Harvey v. Strickland, 350 S.C. 303, 309, 566 S.E.2d 529, 532 (2002).Â  The appellate court will reverse the circuit courtâ€™s ruling on a directed verdict or JNOV motion only when there is no evidence to support the ruling or when the ruling is controlled by an error of law.Â  Law v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 434-35, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648&nbsp;(2006); McMillan v. Oconee Memâ€™l Hosp., Inc., 367 S.C. 559, 564, 626 S.E.2d 884, 886&nbsp;(2006).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nInitially, we note that the circuit court granted Tillmanâ€™s motion for a directed verdict based on several independent sustaining grounds, namely: (1) Gordon failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Tillman committed fraud; (2) Tillman owed no duty to Gordon; (3) Gordonâ€™s reliance on Tillmanâ€™s statements was unreasonable; (4) any damages claimed by Gordon were speculative in nature; (5) a substantial portion of the alleged damages would not have been revealed by a home inspection; and (6) Gordon presented no evidence that Tillman misled Gordon in relation to the CL-100 termite letter signed at closing.Â  \r\nBecause Gordon addressed only the issue of fraud on appeal, we address the remaining alternative sustaining grounds only as they relate to Gordonâ€™s failure to prove fraud.Â  See State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 694 (2003) (â€œNo point will be considered which is not set forth in the statement of issues on appeal.â€) (citing Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR).Â  In view of our disposition on the issue of fraud, we need not separately address the remaining alternative sustaining grounds or Gordonâ€™s argument regarding the trial courtâ€™s exclusion of rental testimony.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (â€œ[An] appellate court need not address remaining issues when disposition of prior issue is dispositive.â€) (internal citation omitted). Â Â \r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directed Verdict on Fraud Cause of Action\r\nGordon claims the circuit court erred in granting a directed verdict on her cause of action for fraud against Tillman because she presented sufficient evidence to submit her claim to the jury.Â  We disagree.\r\nGordon testified that Tillman made several fraudulent representations, which induced her to purchase the house and subsequently incur damages.Â  First, she testified Tillman told her the house would be inspected prior to closing. Â Second, Gordon stated Tillman told her the house was a â€œfine house.â€ Â Further, she contends that Tillman never presented her with the full termite inspection report, and his failure to do so constituted a misrepresentation regarding the condition of the house.Â  \r\nIn South Carolina, to establish a claim for fraud, the complaining party must show by clear and convincing evidence: (1) a representation; (2) falsity of representation; (3) materiality of representation; (4) speakerâ€™s knowledge of its falsity or a reckless disregard for its truth or falsity; (5) intent that the hearer act upon the representation; (6) the hearerâ€™s ignorance of its falsity; (7) the hearerâ€™s reliance on its truth; (8) the hearerâ€™s right to rely thereon; and (9) the hearerâ€™s consequent and proximate injury.Â  Schnellman v. Roettger, 368 S.C. 17, 22-23, 627 S.E.2d 742, 745 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Furthermore, proof of every element is required to succeed on this claim.Â  See Oâ€™Shields v. S. Fountain Mobile Homes, Inc., 262 S.C. 276, 281, 204 S.E.2d 50, 52 (1974) (â€œFailure to prove any of the . . . elements [of fraud] is fatal to recovery.â€) (internal citation omitted).Â Â  \r\na.&nbsp;Tillmanâ€™s statements regarding the home inspection\r\nGordon argues Tillmanâ€™s statement that a home inspection was part of the home purchasing process was a fraudulent misrepresentation on which she detrimentally relied.Â  We disagree.\r\nFirst, we recognize that a sellerâ€™s agent typically owes no fiduciary duty to the buyer in a real estate transaction.Â  See Harrington v. Mikell, 321 S.C. 518, 522, 469 S.E.2d 627, 629 (Ct. App. 1996) (holding that defendant, as agent of seller, owed no fiduciary duty to buyer when agent disclosed to buyer that he was the listing agent of the seller, and thus defendant was not liable for negligent misrepresentation); see also Lengel v. Tom Jenkins Realty, Inc., 286 S.C. 515, 518, 334 S.E.2d 834, 836 n.1 (Ct. App. 1985) (recognizing a real estate agent employed by a seller to sell his home is ordinarily the sellerâ€™s agent, and generally, no fiduciary duty exists between sellerâ€™s agent and buyer);Â  S.C. Code Â§ 40-57-137(F) (Supp. 2005) (â€œA sellerâ€™s agent is not obligated to discover latent defects in property or to advise the agentâ€™s clients on matters outside the scope of the agentâ€™s real estate expertise.â€).Â  \r\nIn this case, Tillman was exclusively the sellerâ€™s agent, which he fully disclosed to Gordon before she signed the purchase contract, both orally and in writing.Â  As sellerâ€™s agent, Tillman owed no special duty to Gordon; thus, Gordon had no right to rely on Gordonâ€™s representations.\r\nSecond, a cause of action for fraud will not lie when a person fails to exercise reasonable diligence in protecting that personâ€™s own interests.Â  J.B. Colt Co. v. Britt, 129 S.C. 226, 233, 123 S.E. 845, 848 (1924); see also Watts v. Monarch Builders, Inc., 272 S.C. 517, 519-20, 252 S.E.2d 889, 891 (1979) (in denying buyersâ€™ claim for fraud against sellers, court held buyers â€œchose to shut their eyesâ€ by failing to examine property as closely as they should have and failing to request a metes and bounds description of the property).Â  \r\nGordon never requested a home inspection report from Tillman at any time during the negotiation process, even though she claims she would not have closed on the house without a home inspection.Â  We find it difficult to imagine that if Gordon felt so strongly about a home inspection, she would not have been more adamant about seeing the appropriate documentation before or during closing.Â  We believe a reasonable home buyer in her position who was fully aware that the broker only represented the seller and was operating under the assumption an inspection was done would have insisted upon a home inspection report pre-closing.Â  See Harrington, 321 S.C. at 522, 469 S.E.2d at 629 (â€œAs part of [a fraud] case, plaintiff must show that the reliance on the misrepresentation was reasonable.â€).\r\nThird, if a contracting party is in a position to learn the contents of a contract and thus be fully protected by reading it, that party is bound by its terms and cannot later cry fraud.Â  Britt, 129 S.C. at 233, 123 S.E. at 848.Â  In Dukes v. Life Ins. Co. of Virginia, 184 S.C. 500, 193 S.E. 36 (1937), the court held the plaintiff had no right to rely on an insurerâ€™s oral representations when plaintiff read the contract and had ample opportunity to discover the discrepancy between the contract and the insurerâ€™s misrepresentations.Â  While recognizing the action was one in tort, not in contract, the court stated: â€œWhen the parties have reduced their contract to writing, the court can look only to the terms in which the parties have expressed their intention . . . .â€ Dukes, 184 S.C. at 507, 193 S.E. at 39.Â  The court noted this quotation serves as â€œan additional warning to those who would avoid a written contact on the ground that it does not express the terms of an oral agreement . . . if the failure to discover the difference is due to the negligence of the plaintiff in acquainting himself with the contents of the instrument . . . .â€ Id.Â  \r\nThe purchase contract between the parties, which Gordon read and signed, stated that Gordon was responsible for conducting a home inspection.Â  Gordon had ample opportunity to read the contract and question Tillman on any discrepancies between their prior conversations and the contract signed by Gordon at closing.Â  Given the facts and her failure to acquaint herself with the contract, Gordon had no right to rely on any statements by Tillman.Â Â  \r\nb. Tillmanâ€™s statements regarding the quality of the house \r\nGordon next argues that Tillman fraudulently misrepresented the condition of the house when he told her the house was a â€œfine house.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nIn deciding whether a statement is fraudulent, our courts have determined that â€œ[n]ot every statement made in the course of a commercial dealing is actionable at law.â€Â  Bishop Logging Co. v. John Deed Indus. Equip. Co., 317 S.C. 520, 526, 455 S.E.2d 183, 187 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  For a representation to be actionable, it must be â€œpredicated on misstatements of fact rather than misstatements of opinion . . . [if a matter is] susceptible of exact knowledge when the statement was made, [it] is usually considered to be a matter of fact.â€ Â Gilbert v. Mid-South Mach. Co., Inc., 267 S.C. 211, 220-21, 227 S.E.2d 189, 193 (1976); see also Fields v. Melrose Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 312 S.C. 102, 439 S.E.2d 283 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding statements that membership prices in resort club would reach a certain level were not fraudulent because â€œpuffingâ€ or sales talk is permitted by law and did not on its face constitute unfair trade practices).Â  Furthermore, to be fraudulent, â€œthe false representation must be predicated upon misstatements of fact rather than upon an expression of opinion, an expression of intention or an expression of confidence that a bargain will be satisfactory.â€Â  Bishop Logging Co., 317 S.C. at 527, 455 S.E.2d at 187 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added). \r\nTillmanâ€™s statement to Gordon that the house was a â€œfine houseâ€ does not rise to the level of a fraudulent representation because expressions of opinion are permissible in a commercial dealing in South Carolina.Â  While the house was not a â€œfine houseâ€ by Gordonâ€™s standards, Tillmanâ€™s statement was nothing more than a subjective expression of confidence in the transaction.Â  Tillmanâ€™s statement was based neither on pre-existing facts nor was it susceptible of exact knowledge; therefore, it does not rise to the level of fraudulent representation.\r\nc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CL-100 Termite Inspection Report\r\nGordonâ€™s final claim is that Tillman defrauded her when he never presented her with the second page of the CL-100 termite report, which she stated disclosed â€œsignificant damage.â€Â  In addition, Gordon claims the signature on the second page of the termite letter is a forgery.Â  We disagree.\r\nHere, Gordon has failed to meet her burden to convince this Court that the circuit court erred in its factual findings.Â  See Blackmon v. United Ins. Co., 235 S.C. 335, 341, 111 S.E.2d 552, 555 (1959) (In holding the record was void of any evidence of bad faith, the court stated â€œfraud is provable by circumstantial evidence, but it is never presumed, and evidence of it must be clear, cogent, and convincing.â€) (internal citations omitted).Â  The circuit court held that Gordon presented no evidence that Tillman defrauded her.Â  Similarly, we find no evidence of record to support Gordonâ€™s assertion that Tillman actively concealed part of the termite report or was involved in forging her signature.Â  Because Gordonâ€™s conclusory assertions are unsupported by the record, we find this argument to be without merit.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the trial courtâ€™s decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.[2]\r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The purchase contract states in pertinent part: â€œSeller shall, at [her] expense, have the property inspected and shall obtain a Wood Infestation Report (CL100) from a licensed and bonded pest control operator . . . .â€ \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-425","title":"Bowyer v.

Brown, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-425\r\nHeard December 4, 2006 â€“ Filed December 19, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Richard H. Rhodes, of Spartanburg, for Appellant-Respondent.\r\n        William G. Rhoden, of Gaffney, for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n        David M. Collins, Jr., of Spartanburg, Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is a cross-appeal from a divorce decree.Â  Kristi C. Bowyer (Wife) appeals the provisions in the decree concerning the grounds for the divorce and custody of the partiesâ€™ children.Â  Christopher Reid Bowyer (Husband) appeals the provisions concerning alimony, attorney fees, and marital debt.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife married on December 6, 1997.Â  They have a daughter born in 1999 and a son born in 2002.Â  The couple separated around March 28, 2004, when Husband left the marital home.Â  On April 14, 2004, Husband filed a complaint for a decree of separate maintenance from Wife and requested custody of the children.Â  On June 4, 2004, Wife filed an answer and counterclaim seeking custody, child support, alimony, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  After an emergency hearing on July 6, 2004, the family court issued an order granting Husband temporary custody of the children with visitation to Wife.\r\nOn October 25, 2004, Wife filed an amended answer and counterclaim alleging Husband was having an adulterous affair.Â  Husband filed a reply denying he was having an affair but admitting he had developed an emotional relationship with a third party, Jody Hayes, and been alone with Hayes.Â  On August 31, 2005, Husband filed an amended complaint requesting a decree of divorce on the ground of separation for more than one year. \r\nOn November 15, 2005, the family court granted the parties a divorce on the ground of separation for more than one year.Â  The family court found Wife suffered from depression and eating disorders before and during the marriage and had a drug overdose early in the marriage.Â  A clinical psychologist who examined both parties found both had some emotional problems but either could function as a custodial parent.Â  The family court awarded the parties joint custody with primary custody to Husband during the school year and primary custody to Wife during the summer.Â  Wife was to pay Husband child support of $298.00 permonth.\r\nRegarding the divorce, the family court found â€œthere was no clear or justifiable cause for [Husband]â€™s leaving the marriageâ€ and â€œhis leaving [was] the cause of the breakup of the marriage.â€Â  Notwithstanding this finding and Husbandâ€™s admission that he had opportunity to commit adultery, the family court found â€œthere was no creditable testimony to establish inclination.â€Â  The family court therefore denied Wifeâ€™s request for a divorce based on adultery. \r\nBased on numerous factors, the family court awarded Wife alimony in the amount of $350.00 per month.Â  The family court also determined the parties had marital debt in the amount of $56,377.38 but noted that Husband had paid $7,892.79 towards the debt since the separation.Â  The family court ordered Husband to pay 60 per cent of the marital debt and Wife to pay the remaining 40 per cent.Â  Specifically, the family court required the parties to pay $500.00 per month towards their debt, with Wife paying her $200.00 to Husband and Husband making the monthly payments until the debt was paid off.Â  The family court found there was no nonmarital property at issue and only nominal marital property consisting of furnishings and a van.Â  The family court ordered that each party would keep whatever assets were currently in his or her possession.Â  Because Wife had possession of the van and most of the furnishings, she received the bulk of the marital estate.\r\nIn determining attorney fees, the family court took into consideration that Husband had already paid $500.00 in attorney fees to Wife under the temporary order and Wife had not paid any child support under the temporary order, which together provided a benefit to Wife of more than $6,000.00.Â  The family court also concluded Husband was in a better position financially and Wife obtained some beneficial results in the divorce proceeding.Â  Based on these findings, the family court ordered Husband to pay Wifeâ€™s attorney $4,000.00. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from a family court order, this court has authority to correct errors of law and find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.[1]Â  Where evidence is disputed, this court may adhere to the family courtâ€™s findings.[2] Â â€œBecause the family court is in a superior position to judge the witnessesâ€™ demeanor and veracity, its findings should be given broad discretion.â€[3]Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Wife argues the family court erred in failing to find Husband had committed adultery.Â  We reject this argument.\r\nAny error the family court may have committed in declining to make such a finding did not inure to Wifeâ€™s prejudice.Â  A divorce on the ground of adultery would not make Wife any more divorced than she currently is.[4]\r\nWe further disagree with Wifeâ€™s contention that a finding that Husband committed adultery would have impacted the family courtâ€™s decision regarding custody of the minor children.Â  â€œThe morality of a parent is a proper factor for consideration but is limited in its force to what relevancy it has, either directly or indirectly, to the welfare of the child. Â Custody of a child is not granted a party as a reward or withheld as a punishmentâ€[5]Â  Assuming without deciding that the evidence warranted a finding that Husband had committed adultery, Wife did not show the alleged adultery had an adverse impact on the children.Â  Nor has she demonstrated that Husbandâ€™s alleged misconduct was of such a â€œflagrantâ€ nature that it would â€œinevitably affect the welfare of the child[ren].â€[6]Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\n2.Â  Wife contends the grant to Husband of primary custody of the children during most of the year is improper because: (1) Husband allegedly committed adultery; (2) the family court found Husband was at fault in the ending of the marriage; (3) it was in the best interests of the children for Wife to have custody; (4) Wife allegedly was the primary caregiver; and (5) the family court placed improper significance on the temporary custody order.Â  We disagree with these arguments.\r\nIn any child custody case, the controlling consideration is the best interests of the children involved.[7]Â  Furthermore, as the supreme court has stated:\r\n\r\n  The family court considers several factors in determining the best interest of the child, including: who has been the primary caretaker; the conduct, attributes, and fitness of the parents; the opinions of third parties (including [the guardian ad litem], expert witnesses, and the children); and the age, health, and sex of the children.[8] \r\n\r\nâ€œ[T]he appellate court should be reluctant to substitute its own evaluation of the evidence on child custody for that of the [family] court.â€[9] â€œThis is especially true in cases involving the welfare and best interests of children.â€[10] Â \r\nAs we have noted earlier in this opinion, the evidence presented in this case did not warrant a finding that Husbandâ€™s alleged adultery had harmed the children.Â  Furthermore, notwithstanding the family courtâ€™s findings that â€œthere was no clear or justifiable cause for [Husbandâ€™s] leaving the marriageâ€ and that â€œhis leaving is the cause of the breakup of the marriage,â€ we found no evidence that Husbandâ€™s actions in ending the marriage adversely affected the children.Â  Absent such evidence, we hold the family court committed no abuse of discretion in refusing to assign greater weight to Husbandâ€™s misconduct as a factor in determining who should have primary custody of the children. \r\nThe family court found the childrenâ€™s current living arrangement to be in their best interests.Â  Although the family court noted both parties had made improvements since their separation and both were fit parents,[11] it also found the childrenâ€™s present situation with Husband as primary custodian during most of the year provided them a stable and protected environment.Â  The family court also noted granting primary custody to Wife would most likely necessitate a change in schools, which would be detrimental to the older child.Â  Finally, Wife has not directed our attention to anything in the record to suggest the children were not doing well in Husbandâ€™s care.\r\nWe further disagree with Wifeâ€™s argument that the family court failed to give appropriate consideration to the fact that she had been the childrenâ€™s primary caregiver before the partiesâ€™ separation as well as with her contention that the family court placed undue emphasis on the temporary order, under which Husband received primary custody of the children.[12]Â  In the appealed order, the family court gives numerous reasons besides the fact that Husband has been the primary custodian of the children since the temporary hearing to support its decision.Â  These reasons include (1) the children are thriving in their present environment; (2) both Husband and Wife had contributed substantially in caring for the children; and (3) Wife had exhibited emotional instability, as evidenced by her eating disorders and one incident of a drug overdose. Â Although we are not unsympathetic to Wifeâ€™s complaint that the custody arrangement under the temporary order may have given Husband an advantage in presenting himself as the better custodial parent, we cannot allow a perceived need to level the playing field thwart the central consideration of a child custody dispute, namely, that of serving the best interests of the children involved. Â As this court noted in Pountain v. Pountain, another case in which the appellant alleged the family court gave prejudicial effect to the temporary custody order, â€œthe child[ren]â€™s sense of security and stability are proper considerations in determining [their] best interest.â€[13]Â  Â Â \r\n3.Â  Contrary to Husbandâ€™s arguments, we find no abuse of discretion in either the grant of alimony to Wife or in the amount awarded. \r\nThe amount to be awarded for alimony, as well as a determination of whether the spouse is entitled to alimony, is within the sound discretion of the family court.[14]Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the decision is controlled by some error of law or is based on findings of fact that are without evidentiary support.â€[15] Â The purpose of alimony is to place the supported spouse, as close as is practical, in the same position of support as during the marriage.[16]Â  If the claim for alimony is well founded, the family court has the duty of making â€œan alimony award that is fit, equitable, and just.â€[17] Â \r\nSouth Carolina Code section 20-3-130(C) lists the factors the family court is to consider in awarding alimony: \r\n\r\n  (1) the duration of the marriage together with the ages of the parties at the time of the marriage and at the time of the divorce or separate maintenance action between the parties; (2) the physical and emotional condition of each spouse; (3) the educational background of each spouse, together with need of each spouse for additional training or education in order to achieve that spouseâ€™s income potential; (4) the employment history and earning potential of each spouse; (5) the standard of living established during the marriage; (6) the current and reasonably anticipated earnings of both spouses; (7) the current and reasonably anticipated expenses and needs of both spouses; (8) the marital and nonmarital properties of the parties, including those apportioned to him or her in the divorce or separate maintenance action; (9) custody of the children, particularly where conditions or circumstances render it appropriate that the custodian not be required to seek employment outside the home, or where the employment must be of a limited nature; (10) marital misconduct or fault of either or both parties, whether or not used as a basis for a divorce or separate maintenance decree if the misconduct affects or has affected the economic circumstances of the parties, or contributed to the breakup of the marriage, except that no evidence of personal conduct which may otherwise be relevant and material for the purpose of this subsection may be considered with regard to this subsection if the conduct took place subsequent to the happening of the earliest of (a) the formal signing of a written property or marital settlement agreement or (b) entry of a permanent order of separate maintenance and support or of a permanent order approving a property or marital settlement agreement between the parties; (11) the tax consequences to each party as a result of the particular form of support awarded; (12) the existence and extent of any support obligation from a prior marriage or for any other reason of either party; and (13) such other factors the court considers relevant.[18]\r\n\r\nIn addition, the South Carolina Supreme Court has held â€œ[t]hree important factors in awarding periodic alimony are (1) the duration of the marriage; (2) the overall financial situation of the parties, especially the ability of the supporting spouse to pay; and (3) whether either spouse was more at fault than the other.â€[19] Â \r\nIn determining whether to award alimony, the family court considered the following: (1) Wife was thirty-two years old and Husband was thirty-years old; (2) the couple was married for over six years before they separated; (3) Wife has had eating disorders in the past but both parties appeared to be healthy at the present time; (4) both parties have possible emotional issues; (5) Husband graduated from high school, attended Presbyterian College, and ultimately graduated from North Greenville College, and Wife only graduated from high school and received no other education or training; (6) Husband was the primary wage earner during the marriage and Wife did not work; (7) Husband is currently a youth minister at a church and Wife works in the office of a small business; (8) the parties have substantial marital debt; (9) neither of their earnings are expected to increase without additional training or education; (10) the parties have no nonmarital property and nominal marital property; (11) the parties have joint custody of the children with split placement; (12) Husband is primarily at fault in the break up of the marriage although he has not been proven guilty of adultery; (13) no tax consequences are anticipated as a result of this action; and (14) neither of the parties have any prior support obligation. \r\nThe family court found Husband had a gross monthly income of $3,606.17 and a net monthly income of $2,537.74.Â  Husband also paid for the childrenâ€™s medical insurance and daycare.Â  Furthermore, the family court found Wifeâ€™s gross monthly income was $1,386.56 and her net monthly income was $1,006.07.Â  Additionally, the family court determined that both parties contributed substantially to caring for the children before the separation, but Husband has been the primary caregiver since the temporary order.Â  Based on these findings, which are supported by the evidence, we hold the family court considered the statutory factors in determining Wifeâ€™s alimony and its decision in awarding alimony is consistent with those factors.Â  Accordingly, the family court did not abuse its discretion in awarding Wife alimony.\r\n4.Â  Husband maintains the family court erred in awarding Wife attorney fees because Wifeâ€™s results were largely unbeneficial and neither party has the ability to pay substantial fees.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe South Carolina General Assembly has authorized the family court to award attorney fees.[20]Â  In making the determination, the family court â€œshould consider each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fee; the beneficial results obtained by the attorney; the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions; and the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.â€[21]Â  â€œAn award of attorneysâ€™ fees and costs is a discretionary matter not to be overturned absent abuse by the trial court.â€[22] Â Beneficial results alone are not dispositive of whether a party is entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees.[23] \r\nBecause the family court awarded her alimony, we hold Wife did receive some beneficial results.Â  Moreover, in deciding the issue of attorney fees, the family court expressly referenced Glasscock v. Glasscock[24] and stated it considered the issue of fault, the partiesâ€™ ability to pay counsel fees and their disproportionate incomes, the impact the fees would have on the party ordered to pay them, Husbandâ€™s payment of $500.00 toward Wifeâ€™s attorney fees pursuant to the temporary order, and the fact that Wife did not pay child support following the temporary order.Â  Significantly, the family court noted Husband earns significantly more than Wife and has more education.Â  We hold the family court considered all the relevant factors in awarding Wife attorney fees, and because that award is supported by the evidence, the family court did not abuse its discretion.\r\n5.Â  Husband argues the appealed order is ambiguous regarding the repayment of marital debts.Â  Husband contends the family court did not give him credit for the $7,892.79 he had paid towards the marital debt prior to the divorce decree but after the separation because it required Husband to make payments of $300.00 per month until the debt was extinguished.Â  We decline to address this argument because it was not raised at trial and is therefore not preserved for appeal.[25] Â Indeed, as Husband himself concedes in his brief, he should have filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion requesting the family court to address this issue.Â  \r\n6.Â  Husband argues that if we find joint custody is not in the best interests of the children, he should be granted sole custody.Â  Because we affirm the award of custody, we need not address this issue.[26]\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, STILWELL, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  E.D.M. v.

Kinard Johnson, Jr., Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-426\r\nSubmitted December 1, 2006 â€“ Filed December 19, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Delores Brown Byrd, of Spartanburg, pro se, for Appellant.\r\n        Fletcher N. Smith, Jr., of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The family court ordered James Byrd (Husband) to pay Delores Brown Byrd (Wife) $50 per week in alimony.Â  Wife appeals the family courtâ€™s decision, claiming no substantial change in circumstances occurred to merit a reduction in the previous alimony award.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife divorced in July 1994. Â The Final Order and Decree of Divorce, dated July 19, 1994, awarded Wife $90 in weekly alimony. Â In the family courtâ€™s order, the Husband could petition the court for a reduction of alimony if: â€œthe wife returns to work; or if the wife receives an award of disability through her [then] pending disability claim . . . .â€ \r\nIn September 1997, Husband requested the family court terminate alimony because Wife was receiving Social Security disability benefits, which Husband averred was sufficient to establish a substantial change in circumstances.Â  In its temporary order, the family court granted Husbandâ€™s requests, finding Wifeâ€™s reception of disability benefits was a substantial change in circumstances warranting termination of alimony at that time.Â  \r\nOn November 4, 2002, Wife petitioned the family court to restore the partiesâ€™ 1997 case and to hold a hearing on the issue of alimony.Â  Wife claimed the sale of the marital home in 2001 and Husbandâ€™s increased income amounted to a substantial change in circumstances, which entitled her to alimony.Â  The family court denied Wifeâ€™s motion to restore the case to active docket on the grounds that â€œit would be unjust to revive [the case] after such an extended period of lack of prosecution.â€Â  \r\nWife appealed to this Court, which remanded the case to family court for a final hearing. Â Specifically, this Court held the Wife demonstrated good cause to support her petition to have the case restored to active docket. (Byrd v. Byrd, Op. No. 2005-UP-141 (S.C. Ct. App. filed March 1, 2005 (unpublished opinion))).Â  \r\nOn remand, the family court determined that a substantial change in circumstances existed to merit a reduction[1] in alimony. Consequently, the family courtâ€™s order, dated November 7, 2005, required Husband to pay Wife $50 per week or alternatively $100 every two weeks in alimony.Â Â Â  \r\nWife asserts the family courtâ€™s November 2005 order was in error because Husband did not establish a substantial change in circumstances, which would merit a reduction in the amount of alimony previously awarded to Wife.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe determination â€œof whether to increase or decrease support based on a finding of changed circumstances is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the family court.â€ Â Thornton v. Thornton, 328 S.C. 96, 111, 492 S.E.2d 86, 94 (1997) (internal citation omitted).Â  To justify modification, the changes in circumstances must be substantial or material. Â Id.Â  The family courtâ€™s determination to modify support will not be disturbed on appeal unless the party claiming error makes a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.Â  Brunner v. Brunner, 296 S.C. 60, 64, 370 S.E.2d 614, 617 (Ct. App. 1988). Â An abuse of discretion occurs when the court is controlled by some error of law or when the order, based upon factual findings, is without evidentiary support. Â Â Hailey v. Hailey, 357 S.C. 18, 23, 590 S.E.2d 495, 497 (Ct. App. 2003). Â \r\nHowever, in appeals from the family court, this Court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 283, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002).Â  This broad scope of review does not require this Court to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Nor must we ignore the fact that the family court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Lacke v. Lacke, 362 S.C. 302, 307, 608 S.E.2d 147, 150 (Ct. App. 2005). Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWife argues the family court erred in reducing her alimony award because no substantial change in circumstances existed to warrant a reduction.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nSouth Carolina law allows a spouse to request modification of alimony upon the occurrence of a change in circumstances.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-170 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2005).Â  Once both parties are given the opportunity to be heard and present evidence at a hearing, the family court may â€œmake such order and judgment as justice and equity shall require, with due regard to the changed circumstances and the financial ability of the supporting spouse, decreasing or increasing or confirming the amount of alimony provided for in such original judgment or terminating such payments.â€Â  Id. Â \r\nWife argues Husband did not establish a substantial change in circumstances.Â  In the 1994 divorce decree, the family court specifically stated that if Wife received an award of disability, the â€œhusband would have the ability to claim a material change in circumstances and . . . petition th[e] [c]ourt for a reduction of alimony.â€Â  Neither party appealed this order.Â  Although Wife receiving disability benefits does not automatically qualify Husband for a reduction in alimony, this occurrence allows the family court to revisit the issue of alimony. Â \r\nThe family court properly considered the partiesâ€™ testimony and financial declarations in determining whether the change in circumstances was sufficiently material to alter the alimony award.Â  As set forth in South Carolina Code Section 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2005), the family court reviewed and considered each partyâ€™s income, expenses, and assets at the time of divorce and at the time of this hearing.Â  \r\nIn 1994, Husbandâ€™s net monthly income was $1,224,[2] and Wife claimed no monthly income. Â In 2005, Husbandâ€™s net monthly income was $1,762, and Wifeâ€™s net monthly income, including food stamps, was $701.Â  The family court considered the increase in income of both parties and their monthly expenses.Â  The court properly used its discretion in refusing to terminate alimony.Â  In declining to terminate alimony, the court appropriately reduced Wifeâ€™s alimony to $50 per week.Â  \r\nWhile Wife claims her expenses have increased since the date of divorce, her income has also increased.Â  Wife alleges that without more alimony, she cannot â€œmak[e] ends meet.â€ Â Despite this claim, Wife has apparently managed to incur no debt according to her financial declaration. Â Wifeâ€™s lack of debt, without further explanation, weakens her claim that without more alimony she cannot pay her expenses. Â Husband, on the other hand, has incurred debt, and his expenses have increased since the date of divorce.Â  It appears the family court appropriately considered all the changes in circumstances of the parties.Â  As such, we cannot say that the family court clearly abused its discretion in reducing Wifeâ€™s alimony. \r\nBecause modification of an alimony award is committed to the sound discretion of the family court, and sufficient facts exist in the record to support the family courtâ€™s reduction of alimony, we find the family courtâ€™s ruling was proper.Â  See Thornton, 328 S.C. at 111, 492 S.E.2d at 94. Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the family courtâ€™s decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.[3]\r\nAnderson, Huff, and Williams, J.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] On remand, the family court ordered a reduction as to its original 1994 order, which awarded Wife $90 in alimony.Â  The 1997 order that terminated alimony was only a temporary order, and as such, the family court had the ability to reinstate and reduce the alimony from the original order.Â  Â \r\n[2] In discussing Husband and Wifeâ€™s income, the family court and parties reference Husbandâ€™s gross monthly income of $1,880 in 1994, but in 2005 refer to his net income of $1,762. Â For the ease of comparison, we reference Husbandâ€™s net monthly income of $1,224 in 1994 as compared with his net monthly income of $1,762 in 2005.Â  \r\n[3] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-427","title":"Collins v.

Drew, Jr., Master-in-Equity\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No.Â  2006-UP-427\r\nSubmitted December 1, 2006 â€“ Filed December 19, 2006\r\n\r\n AFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Earle G. Prevost and Sean Gray Tzouvelekas, both of Greenville, for Appellants. \r\n        Bradley A. Norton, of Walhalla, John S. Nichols, of Columbia and Julian L. Stoudemire, ofÂ  Seneca, for Respondents. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Randall Collins and Ann Collins (collectively the Collinses) appeal the trial courtâ€™s ruling that a thirty-seven and one half foot easement existed over their property.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThe Collinses brought an action against Barbara Griffin, individually and as Trustee of the Griffin Living Trust (Griffin), Jo Ann Knox as Trustee of the Knox Living Trust (Knox), and Oconee County.Â  \r\nThe Collinses sought relief on three grounds.Â  They requested: (1) a declaratory judgment regarding the partiesâ€™ rights in real property located in Oconee County; (2) an order from the trial court requiring Oconee County to deed the real property at issue to them; and (3) actual and punitive damages along with injunctive relief based on a nuisance and trespass action against Griffin.Â Â  \r\nIn response, Knox executed and delivered a quitclaim deed conveying any interest she may have held in the real property to the Collinses.Â  Consequently, Knox was dismissed from the action.Â  Oconee County did not actively engage in the litigation and agreed to abide by the trial courtâ€™s order or the partiesâ€™ agreement.Â  Griffin denied liability for nuisance and trespass, and denied the Collinses were entitled to the relief sought in the declaratory action.Â  The case was tried before the Oconee County Master-in-Equity.Â  \r\nAt trial, the Collinses decided they no longer wished to seek damages for nuisance and trespass but would proceed solely on the action for declaratory relief.Â  Therefore, the case focused on the partiesâ€™ rights in the real property.Â  \r\nThe real property at issue is located on Lake Keowee in Oconee County.Â  The property extends from the mainland in a southern direction to form a point on Lake Keowee.Â  Therefore, water surrounds the property to the east, south, and west.Â  The property is bordered on the western part by a road running north to south called S 37-589.[1]Â  \r\nThis road was placed next to the property pursuant to a seventy-five foot right-of-way.Â  Road S 37-589 divided the seventy-five foot right-of-way, which meant thirty-seven and one half feet of right-of-way existed on each side of the center line of S 37-589.Â  \r\nIn the early 1970â€™s, the State abandoned a portion of S 37-589.[2]Â  Consequently, title to the abandoned portion of S 37-589 reverted to Oconee County.Â  In turn, Oconee County abandoned this portion of S 37-589 and transferred the right-of-way back to the adjacent property owners.[3]Â  \r\nThe land on the eastern part of Windsong Way, owned by Crescent Land &amp; Timber Corporation (Crescent), was divided into two parcels, A and B.Â  Crescent transferred Parcel B to Mac and Sybil Evatt and Parcel A to Barbara Griffin as Trustee for the Griffin Living Trust.Â  Shortly after acquiring Parcel B, the Evatts granted two easements in favor of the Griffin Living Trust.Â  The deed granted: Â \r\n\r\n   1.&nbsp; a non-exclusive easement for ingress and egress over the existing roadbed from the northernmost boundary of Parcel A to that point where Petty Road is maintained by State; and\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;a non-exclusive easement along the existing water line located on or adjacent to an existing roadbed including that roadbed as shown on plat prepared by Gregory Blake Sosebee, PLS #14878, dated October 28, 1997 which is both maintained and not maintained, for maintenance and improvement of water lines.Â  \r\n\r\nA few months later, the Evatts transferred Parcel B to the Collinses.Â  They conveyed the parcel subject to the â€œright-of-way for S.C. Highway S-37-589 (Petty Road) and Windsong Way (Old S-37-589) as shown on the [Cooper Plat].â€ Furthermore, the Collinsesâ€™ property rights were encumbered by â€œany and all easements or right-of-ways granted by the Grantor(s) herein or any predecessor in title, as may appear of public record or upon the premises.â€Â  \r\nThe dispute between the parties concerns the scope, specifically the width, of the easements given to the Griffin Trust by the Evatts.Â  The parties disagree regarding the meaning of the terms â€œexisting roadbedâ€ and â€œmaintenance and improvementâ€ as used in the easements granted to the Griffin Trust from the Evatts.Â  The Collinses contend the term â€œroadbedâ€ means the paved road.Â  Conversely, Griffin argues the term means at least thirty-seven and one half feet from the center of S 37-589.Â  The Collinses also argue the term â€œmaintenance and improvementâ€ does not entitle Griffin to relocate her water lines from the western side of Windsong Way over to the eastern side.Â  The Master disagreed with the Collinses.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAs noted, above the Collinses decided to proceed solely on the action for declaratory relief.Â  Because declaratory judgment actions are neither legal nor equitable, the standard of review depends on the nature of the primary issues.Â  Campbell v. Marion County Hosp. Dist., 354 S.C. 274, 279, 580 S.E.2d 163, 165 (Ct. App. 2003).Â Â Â  \r\nWhether an easement exists is a question of fact in a law action and is subject to the any evidence standard.Â  Tupper v. Dorchester Cty., 326 S.C. 318, 323, 487 S.E.2d 187, 190 (1997).Â  However, the determination of the scope of an easement is an equitable matter, in which an appellate court may take its own view of the evidence.Â  Id.Â  Similarly, if an action mandates interpreting a deed, it is an equitable matter, and an appellate court may take its own view of the evidence.Â  Slear v. Hanna, 329 S.C. 407, 410-11, 496 S.E.2d 633, 635 (1998).\r\nIn the case sub judice, the Master determined the scope of an easement, which necessarily required the Master to interpret deeds.Â  Therefore, we may take our own view of the evidence.Â  However, we are mindful that this scope of review does not require us to disregard the Masterâ€™s factual findings because the Master saw and heard witnesses and was in a better position to judge their credibility and demeanor.Â  Godfrey v. Heller, 311 S.C. 516, 518, 429 S.E.2d 859, 860 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  Additionally, if we choose to find facts in accordance with our view of the evidence, we must state such findings of fact and our reasoning for those findings.Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 283, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nâ€œAn easement is a right which one person has to use the land of another for a specific purpose.â€Â  Steele v. Williams, 204 S.C. 124, 132, 28 S.E.2d 644, 647 (1944).Â  The character of an easement is determined by the nature of the right and the intentions of the parties who created the easement.Â  Smith v. Commâ€™rs of Pub. Works of City of Charleston, 312 S.C. 460, 467, 441 S.E.2d 331, 336 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  To determine the purpose of an easement, the intention of the parties must be ascertained.Â  Lighthouse Tennis Club Village Horizontal Prop. Regime LXVI v. S. Island Pub. Serv. Dist., 355 S.C. 529, 534, 586 S.E.2d 146, 148 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nTo determine intent, â€œclear and unambiguous language in grants of easements must be construed according to terms which parties have used, taken, and understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense.â€ Id. (internal quotations omitted).Â  However, if the language of the easement is not clear and creates ambiguity in any respect, all surrounding circumstances, including the construction which the parties have placed on the language, may be inquired into and taken into consideration.Â  Smith, 312 S.C. at 466, 441 S.E.2d at 335.Â  \r\nA. Ambiguity of the term â€œroadbedâ€ \r\nAs noted above, the easement granted to the Griffin Trust provides â€œa non-exclusive easement for ingress and egress over the existing roadbed from the northernmost boundary of Parcel A to that point where Petty Road is maintained by State.â€Â  Initially, we must determine whether the term â€œroadbedâ€ is ambiguous.Â  \r\nWe note â€œroadbedâ€ was not defined in the easement granted to the Griffin Trust by the Evatts.Â  Additionally, a thorough search of South Carolina law has failed to reveal a clear answer as to the meaning of â€œroadbedâ€.Â  Long Motor Lines v. Home Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. of Cal., 220 S.C. 335, 339, 67 S.E.2d 512, 514 (1951) (roadbed includes that portion of the road which is used for travel) (emphasis added); Bates v. Legette, 239 S.C. 25, 32, 121 S.E.2d 289, 292 (1961) (roadway is the portion of highway designed or ordinarily used for vehicular travel).Â  \r\nWe hold â€œroadbedâ€ is an ambiguous term as used in the easement granted to the Griffin Trust, because the parties did not define the term, and its meaning is not clearly defined in South Carolina law.Â  Having determined an ambiguity exists, we must ascertain what the term â€œroadbedâ€ means in this context. \r\nB. The meaning of the term â€œroadbedâ€\r\nAs noted above, the deed from the Evatts to the Collinses makes reference not only to the right-of-way for Petty Road and Windsong Way, but it also refers to all easements that are part of the public record.Â  This would include the easement granted by the Evatts as well as the deed used by Oconee County when it transferred the right-of-way back to the adjacent property owners.Â  McDonald v. Welborn, 220 S.C. 10, 16, 66 S.E.2d 327, 330 (1951) (â€œThe law imputes to a purchaser of real estate notice of the recitals contained in the written instruments forming his chain of title . . . and charges him with the duty of making such reasonable inquiry and investigation as is suggested by the recitals and references therein contained.â€) (internal citations omitted).\r\n The deed in pertinent part reads, â€œOconee County, South Carolina, has abandoned some 625 feet of roadbed which was part of the County public road and way known and designated as Road S-16 . . . .â€Â  (internal quotations omitted) (emphasis added).Â  The deed transfers â€œ[a]ll the Grantorâ€™s right, title and interest in and to all that portion of Road S-16 . . . which abuts upon and adjoins other lands of the Grantee.â€Â  The Oconee grant would necessarily include the seventy-five feet because all of the Countyâ€™s rights in the abandoned right-of-way encompass the seventy-five feet. Â Â \r\nThe Evatts provided the Griffin Trust an easement over the â€œexisting roadbed from the northernmost boundary of Parcel A to that point where Petty Road is maintained by State.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  The Evatts chose the same language as Oconee County when the latter transferred all of its rights to the adjoining property owners.Â  Namely, the Evatts used the term â€œroadbed.â€Â  If the Evatts intended to confer an easement solely over the paved portion of the road, they would have used language such as â€œpaved roadâ€ or â€œroadway.â€ \r\nAdditionally, if the language in a deed is ambiguous, the ambiguity is construed against the grantor.Â  Ward v. Woodward, 287 S.C. 343, 345, 338 S.E.2d 347, 348 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  The Evatts were the grantors of the easement to the Griffin Trust.Â  In that grant, an ambiguity arose regarding the meaning of â€œroadbed.â€Â  Thus, we construe roadbed as including at least thirty-seven and one half feet from the center line of Windsong Way over the property of the Collinses. \r\nC. Waterline easement\r\nThe Collinses next argue the Master erred in concluding Griffin had an easement for the purpose of maintaining an existing waterline over the Collinsesâ€™ property of thirty-seven and one half feet from the center line of Windsong Way.Â  We disagree. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAs noted above, the Evatt easement provided â€œa non-exclusive easement along the existing water line located on or adjacent to an existing roadbed including that roadbed as shown on plat prepared by Gregory Blake Sosebee, PLS #14878, dated October 28, 1997 which is both maintained and not maintained, for maintenance and improvement of water lines.â€Â  \r\nThis easement also uses the term â€œroadbed.â€Â  As explained supra the term roadbed, as used in the Evatt easement, is more than the paved road.Â  It includes at least thirty-seven and one half feet from the center line of Windsong Way over the property of the Collinses.Â  Thus, the easement would permit Griffin to put waterlines within that boundary. \r\nNonetheless, the Collinses argue the easement refers to an â€œexisting water line.â€Â  The Collinses contend when the Evatt easement was recorded, the â€œexisting water lineâ€ was on the western side of S 37-589.Â  As such, the easement does not allow Griffin to put any waterlines on the eastern side of S 37-589.Â  \r\nHowever, the Collinses fail to observe the easement allows for â€œmaintenance and improvementâ€ of waterlines, without specifying where such maintenance or improvement is to be restricted.Â  As mentioned above, ambiguity is construed against the grantor.Â  Consequently, we hold Griffin had an easement for the purpose of maintaining an existing waterline over the Collinsesâ€™ property of thirty-seven and one half feet from the center line of Windsong Way. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED. [4]Â  \r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Road S 37-589 was at one time known as S 37-16; however, we will refer to it under its current designation.\r\n[2]Â  The portion of S 37-589 that the State still maintains is known as Petty Road.Â  The abandoned portion is known as Windsong Way.Â  \r\n[3] The deed in pertinent part reads: â€œOconee County, South Carolina, has abandoned some 625 feet of roadbed which was part of the County public road and way known and designated as Road S-16 . . . .â€Â  (internal quotations omitted) The deed transfers â€œ[a]ll the Grantorâ€™s right, title and interest in and to all that portion of Road S-16 . . . which abuts upon and adjoins other lands of the Grantee.â€Â  \r\n[4] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-428","title":"Scott v.

Valenta, Jr. and Kelli Gregg Maddox, both of Blythewood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Traci Denise Scott appeals the 90-day suspension of her driverâ€™s license, imposed because of her refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nScott was arrested by State Highway Patrol Trooper B. M. Hamm for driving under the influence.Â  Once at the Greenwood County Detention Center, Trooper Hamm provided Scott with her implied consent rights and, after twenty minutes, offered her a breathalyzer test.Â  Scott declined the test.Â  Trooper Hamm documented Scottâ€™s refusal and confiscated her driverâ€™s license.Â  The South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles suspended her license pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2951(A) (Rev. 2006), which provides that the DMV â€œmust suspend the driverâ€™s license . . . [of] a person who drives a motor vehicle and refuses to submit to a test provided for in Section 56-5-2950.â€Â  Scott appealed the suspension arguing that she did not refuse the breathalyzer because she was never offered the test as proscribed in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950(a) (Rev. 2006). Â This section provides that the breath test â€œmust be administered by a person trained and certified by the Department of Public Safety, pursuant to SLED policies.â€ Â Id.Â  Trooper Hammâ€™s certification had expired prior to Scottâ€™s arrest.Â  Scott appealed, and the DMV hearing officer upheld her suspension.Â  Scott then appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed the hearing officerâ€™s ruling that Trooper Hammâ€™s lack of current certification was irrelevant, because Scott had refused to take the test.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAlthough neither party addresses the appropriate scope of review in their briefs, we believe the Administrative Procedures Act governs.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380 (Supp. 2005).Â  Considering the questions presented in this case, the APA would allow an appellate court to reverse or modify the agencyâ€™s decision if the decision was affected by an error of law or was clearly erroneous in light of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the record as a whole.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5)(d)-(e) (Supp. 2005).Â \r\nOtherwise, the appellate court would be required to affirm the judgment.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nScott correctly asserts that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950(a) requires a breath test to be administered by a certified individual.Â  She would have us interpret the term â€œadministerâ€ as inclusive of or equivalent to â€œoffer.â€Â  However, a plain reading of the entire statute reveals no such intent on the part of the legislature.Â  The statute contains no certification requirement for a person offering the test.Â  It simply states: Â â€œAt the direction of the arresting officer, the [arrestee] must first be offered a breath test to determine the personâ€™s alcohol concentration.â€ Â Id.Â  If a statuteâ€™s language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, there is no need to employ rules of statutory interpretation, and the court has no right to look for or impose another meaning.Â  Paschal v. State Election Commâ€™n, 317 S.C. 434, 436, 454 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1995).Â  Had the legislature intended to require that a certified person offer the test, it could have expressly included that condition just as it expressly provided for a certified person to administer the test. \r\nFurthermore, this issue has been discussed by our supreme court in State v. Jansen, 305 S.C. 320, 408 S.E.2d 235 (1991).Â  In Jansen, the court held that the officerâ€™s failure to observe certain procedural safeguards intended to ensure the validity of the breath test results did not render the refusal to take the test inadmissible.Â  \r\n\r\nThe only evidence offered was the defendantâ€™s refusal to submit to the test, not the results of such a test. Â The Parker precautions[2] do not apply in this situation as there were no test results which required protection from improper testing procedures. Â Therefore, the evidence of defendantâ€™s refusal to submit to the breathalyzer test should not have been suppressed.Â  \r\n\r\nJansen at 323, 408 S.E.2d at 237.\r\nLikewise, the requirement of a certified breath test administrator is to ensure the validity and accuracy of test results.Â  In this case as in Parker, there are no results that require protection from improper testing procedures, and the admission of Scottâ€™s refusal was proper.\r\nScott further contends that her notice of suspension was invalid, because it was not signed by a certified DataMaster operator.Â  This issue was neither raised to nor ruled upon by the trial court and is therefore not preserved for our review.Â  See State v. Baker, 310 S.C. 510, 513, 427 S.E.2d 670, 672 (1993) (stating an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review). \r\nWe conclude the hearing officerâ€™s disposition of Scottâ€™s appeal was proper, and the decision of the trial court is Â \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, STILWELL, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] To admit breath test results, the State may be required to show that (1) the machine was in proper working order at the time of the test; (2) the correct chemicals had been used; (3) the accused was not allowed to put anything in his mouth for twenty minutes prior to the test; and (4) the test was administered by a qualified person in the proper manner.Â  See State v. Parker, 271 S.C. 159, 163, 245 S.E.2d 904, 906 (1978).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-429","title":"State v.

Â At trial, Cheryl Smoak, the manager of Modern Dry Cleaners, testified that two armed, black males entered the store at approximately 12:12 p.m. and demanded the money from the cash register.Â  She could not identify the two men, because they were wearing masks.Â  Smoak indicated the robbers got away with $166, composed of ones, fives, and one twenty dollar bill.Â  \r\nBlackville Police Officer Johnny Fulmer testified he had seen Mays and Donaldson walking together on Sol Blatt Avenue, a main street in Blackville, in the direction of the cleaners at approximately 11:00 a.m. Â Another witness, Jamie Jones, testified he had also seen the men together in that vicinity approximately thirty minutes before the robbery.Â  Jones further testified that as he was riding by the cleaners later that morning, he witnessed two men run out of the cleaners wearing masks.Â  One of the men took off his mask, and Jones recognized him as Donaldson.Â  Jones and Smoak provided information to police regarding the identification and description of the suspects.Â  \r\nMaysâ€™ and Donaldsonâ€™s cousin, Tiffany Vice, testified that the two men arrived at her house around 12:30 p.m. and stayed with her on the porch for approximately thirty minutes.Â  They arrived â€œbreathing hardâ€ and â€œhad dust on them.â€Â  Captain Steven Griffith of the Barnwell County Sheriffâ€™s Department was one of the officers involved in the search for suspects.Â  He saw Mays and Donaldson in the Oak Street Cemetery, an area interlaced with paths and shortcuts allowing people to travel from one part of town to another.Â  Captain Griffith drew his gun and ordered the men to raise their hands.Â  Mays complied, but Donaldson ran.Â  Donaldson was shortly discovered hiding in a nearby shed. Â Upon his arrest Mays had $45 in fives and ones and a new pack of cigarettes.Â  On the roof of the shed where Donaldson was apprehended, police found $117 made up of one twenty dollar bill, fives, and ones.Â  \r\nMays moved for a directed verdict at the close of the Stateâ€™s case and again at the conclusion of the trial, arguing that the case against Mays was based entirely on circumstantial evidence and raised only the suspicion of guilt. Â Those motions were denied, and Mays appeals. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the denial of a directed verdict, this court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. James, 362 S.C. 557, 561, 608 S.E.2d 455, 457 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  When the State relies exclusively on circumstantial evidence and a motion for directed verdict is made, the court is concerned with the existence of evidence, not its weight.Â \r\nState v. Cherry, 361 S.C. 588, 594, 606 S.E.2d 475, 478 (2004). Â â€œ[I]t is the trial judgeâ€™s â€˜duty to submit the case to the jury if there be any substantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused, or from which his guilt may be fairly and logically deduced.â€™â€ Â Id. Â (quoting State v. Edwards, 298 S.C. 272, 275, 379 S.E.2d 888, 889 (1989)).Â  The court should grant a directed verdict motion when the evidence presented merely raises a suspicion of guilt.Â  State v. Lollis, 343 S.C. 580, 584, 541 S.E.2d 254, 256 (2001).Â  â€œâ€˜Suspicionâ€™ implies a belief or opinion as to guilt based upon facts or circumstances which do not amount to proof.â€Â  Id. Â â€œHowever,\r\na trial judge is not required to find that the evidence infers guilt to the exclusion of any other reasonable hypothesis.â€ Â Cherry at 594, 606 S.E.2d at 478 (emphasis omitted).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMays correctly argues that he is linked to the robbery through circumstantial evidence.Â  However, when viewed in the light most favorable to the State, we agree there is evidence from which his guilt can be fairly and logically deduced.Â  Mays was clearly seen with Donaldson, who was identified at the crime scene, in the time immediately preceding the robbery.Â  Immediately following the robbery, the two men arrived at their cousinâ€™s home breathing heavily and covered in dust, which could suggest the two had been fleeing the scene of the crime.Â  Additionally, the amounts and denominations of money found on Mays and Donaldson, coupled with the cost of a pack of cigarettes, are consistent with what was stolen from the cleaners. Â It can be logically deduced that the two men went to the cleaners, committed the robbery, fled to their cousinâ€™s house, and were caught together with the spoils of their crime.Â  Because evidence exists sufficient to submit the question of guilt or innocence to the jury, the decision of the trial court is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, STILWELL, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-430","title":"SCDSS v.

H. Hodges, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Emmanuel O. (Father) appeals the termination of his parental rights to his two minor children.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn March of 1997, Father and Mother threatened to kill each other while in court on a domestic violence issue.Â  At the time, Mother and Father had one infant child.Â  The family court placed that child and three of Motherâ€™s other children into foster care.Â  A safety plan was instituted, and the minor child was returned to Mother within three days.Â  The safety plan was violated, and the child returned to foster care where she has remained since 1997.Â  Father and Mother had another child in December of 1997.Â  When that child was a few months old, Mother delivered the child to the South Carolina Department of Social Services, reporting she could not care for the child.Â  Both remain in the custody of DSS and have been placed together in foster care.Â  \r\nDSS ordered treatment plans for Mother and Father.Â  Father was ordered to: Â 1) undergo a psychological evaluation; 2) pay child support; 3) submit to random drug screens; 4) visit with the children; and 5) attend and successfully complete individual counseling, family counseling, and parenting skills classes.Â  DSS contends Father did not complete his treatment plan, other than visiting with the children.Â  Further, DSS presented evidence that Father tested positive for drugs in ten out of eleven screenings.Â  Father submitted evidence he completed anger management counseling and individual counseling and satisfactorily completed parenting classes.Â  Although Father has paid a few lump sum payments in child support[2] and sometimes provided toys and gifts during visitations, he has failed to pay all of his child support.Â  Father also has criminal convictions for possession of schedule controlled substances and failure to stop for a blue light.Â  \r\nDSS filed this action in July of 2002.Â  The matter was continued several times. Â At a hearing on June of 2004, the case was scheduled for two days in September.Â  The family court judge stated that the case could not be continued for any reason.Â  When the case was called on September 20, 2004, Father was not present.[3]Â  The case proceeded in Fatherâ€™s absence.Â  At the end of DSSâ€™s case, Fatherâ€™s counsel moved to continue the case to allow Father to testify.Â  The family court denied the motion but allowed counsel to reserve the right to reopen the case should Father appear.Â  \r\nThe following day, court reconvened and Father attended, moving to reopen the case based on his belief the hearing was scheduled for September&nbsp;21.Â  In six letters, written between June 22, 2002 and August 31, 2004, Fatherâ€™s counsel incorrectly informed Father the hearing was scheduled for September 21 rather than September 20.Â  \r\nThe family court denied the motion to reopen the case finding that despite the misinformation, Father should have known the date because the family court judge announced the date during the June 2004 hearing.Â  The court also found Fatherâ€™s counsel made a good faith and appropriate effort to notify Father of his mistake.Â  \r\nThe family court found grounds existed for terminating the parental rights of Mother and Father. Â Specifically, the family court found termination warranted based on the following statutory grounds:Â  1) the minor children lived outside the home for a period of time in excess of six consecutive months and Father failed to remedy the conditions existing at the time of the childrenâ€™s removal; 2) Father willfully failed to support the minor children; and 3) the children were in foster care for fifteen of the preceding twenty-two months.Â  The family court also found termination of Fatherâ€™s parental rights in the best interest of the children.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFather contends the family court erred in failing to reopen the case.[4]Â  We find no reversible error.Â  \r\nA trial courtâ€™s decision on a motion to reopen a case is discretionary and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  Lites&nbsp;v. Taylor, 284 S.C. 316, 319, 326 S.E.2d 173, 175 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  â€œAn\r\nabuse of discretion occurs either when a court is controlled by some error of law, or where the order is based upon findings of fact lacking evidentiary support.â€ Â Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 529, 599 S.E.2d 114, 121 (2004). \r\nRegardless of the propriety of the family courtâ€™s ruling on Fatherâ€™s motion to reopen, we find termination appropriate.[5]Â  Though Fatherâ€™s testimony may have shown he did not willfully fail to support the children, and he met some of the treatment plan goals, there is no dispute regarding the childrenâ€™s placement in foster care for fifteen out of twenty-two months.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(8) (Supp. 2005) (providing a ground for termination where a child â€œhas been in foster care under the responsibility of the State for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two monthsâ€).Â  Both children have been in foster care for over eight years.Â  During this time, Father has failed to remedy all of the conditions existing at the time of removal.Â  \r\nWhile it is clear grounds exist for the termination of Fatherâ€™s parental rights, we must still determine if such a termination is in the best interest of the children.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2005) (providing family court can terminate parental rights if it finds at least one of the statutory grounds for termination has been met and the termination is in the best interest in of the child).Â  In a TPR action, the best interest of the child is the paramount consideration.Â  Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Before parental rights can be terminated, the alleged grounds for the termination must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Richberg v. Dawson, 278 S.C. 356, 357, 296 S.E.2d 338, 339 (1982).Â  On appeal, this court may review the record and make its own determination whether the grounds for termination are supported by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 293, 547 S.E.2d 506, 509 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Despite this broad scope of review, we do not disregard the findings of the family court judge who was in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and assign weight to their testimony. Â Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nThe DSS caseworker, Melissa Mathis, testified Father visited the children twice a month and generally behaved appropriately during the visits.Â  She also testified the children have a loving relationship with Father and enjoy spending time with him.Â  However, Mathis recommended termination due to the childrenâ€™s ages, their need for a stable environment, and Fatherâ€™s failure to complete his treatment objectives.Â  \r\nAlthough a previous guardian recommended Fatherâ€™s rights not be terminated, the childrenâ€™s most recent guardian, Carrie E. Adkins, concluded Fatherâ€™s parental rights should be terminated.Â  She testified Father acted erratically and espoused conspiracy theories about the termination of his rights.Â  Adkins believed the children felt conflicted about their status and wanted only one set of parents.Â  Adkins admitted she did not evaluate the children interacting with Father, and the children have never stated that they wanted to sever ties with Father.Â  \r\nWe find termination of Fatherâ€™s rights is appropriate in this case.Â  The children have been in foster care for over eight years, have expressed a desire for only one set of parents, and have bonded with their foster parents.Â  Father has failed to complete the treatment plan and has a history of drug abuse and incarceration.Â  We accordingly agree it is in the best interest of the children that Fatherâ€™s parental rights be terminated.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n GOOLSBY, STILWELL, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n[2] Father made four payments:Â  1) March 2004â€”$666.67; 2) 1998â€”$1359.20; 3) 1998â€”$291.26; and 4) 1997â€”$97.09. \r\n[3] Mother did not attend and is believed to be incarcerated in Georgia. \r\n[4] Father raises numerous other arguments concerning ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  We incorporate these issues in our address of the primary issue.Â  \r\n[5] We recognize that parents facing termination of parental rights warrant protection under the law and due process mandates a fair procedure.Â  See S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cochran, 364 S.C. 621, 626, 614 S.E.2d 642, 645 (2005).Â  However, we find no violation of Fatherâ€™s right to notice.Â  The family court notified all present at the June 2004 hearing, including Father, of the date of the hearing.Â  In addition, the family court found that Fatherâ€™s counsel, upon realizing his mistake, made a good faith and appropriate effort to notify Father of the correct date.Â  Finally, Father appeared on the second day thirty minutes late and at his attorneyâ€™s office rather than at the courthouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-431","title":"Lancaster v.

Cooper, Master-in-Equity\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-431\r\nSubmitted November 1, 2006 â€“ Filed December 20, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJanneth E. and Launeil Sanders, of Inman; pro se.Â  \r\nDavid G. Ingalls, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Launeil Sanders (Sanders) and Janneth Sanders appeal the master-in-equityâ€™s finding that the mechanicâ€™s lien should be foreclosed and the amount of the damages awarded.Â  Sanders contends the master erred in ruling on his claims for breach of contract, fraud, negligence, and unfair trade practices because a jury trial was requested on those issues.Â Â  Sanders also raises numerous other issues concerning attorney and judicial misconduct.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nSanders was building a residence on land he owned.Â  He acted as his own contractor to build a modular or â€œpanelizedâ€ home. Â Sanders had the building permit issued in his name and personally hired the subcontractors involved in the construction.Â  Brian Lancaster d/b/a Lancaster Construction (Lancaster) was hired to construct the foundation of the house and erect the wall panels up to the roof.Â  Lancaster was to provide labor consisting of himself and two others for a maximum of eight hours per day. Â The parties agreed Lancaster would be paid $25.00 per hour per man.Â  Lancaster also testified that he rented machinery for a daily fee and purchased building supplies.Â  \r\nDuring construction, a dispute arose concerning payment, forcing Lancaster to file a mechanicâ€™s lien on the subject property.Â  Lancaster provided a Verified Statement of Account setting forth the personnel and hours worked.Â  Lancaster also sought judgment for a fifteen percent fee he claims he is owed as the contractor.Â  Sanders disputed the fees owed and counterclaimed for breach of contract, fraud, negligence/negligent misrepresentation, and unfair trade practices.Â  Sanders claimed Lancaster failed to build a fireplace as specified in the plans and improperly wasted lumber while on the jobsite.Â  Sanders argued there was an inaccuracy in the billing statement, citing a day when Sanders was present with the exterminator and Lancaster was not.Â  In his complaint, Sanders asked for a jury trial.Â  \r\nWhen Lancaster filed his mechanicâ€™s lien and complaint, the case was given two case numbers, 2002-CP-42-4362 and 2002-CP-42-4363.Â  At the hearing, it was decided to proceed under the caption of 2002-CP-42-4362.Â  Sanders did not file an answer to this complaint, but did file, pro se, a complaint against Lancaster.Â  Sandersâ€™ complaint was given the case number 2002-CP-42-4224.Â  Lancaster filed a Motion to Make More Definite, a Motion to Consolidate 2002-CP-42-4362 and 2002-CP-42-4363, and a Motion for Compulsory Reference.Â  The motions were heard on February 5, 2003, when the parties decided to continue the case for thirty days and Sanders was ordered to hire an attorney.Â Â  Lancasterâ€™s action was referred to the master by Order of the Clerk of Court dated September 29, 2004.Â  \r\nA hearing was held November 4, 2004.Â  Sanders was present, as was Lancasterâ€™s attorney.Â  The court, sua sponte, elected to treat the hearing as a status conference.Â  By consent of the parties the two actions were consolidated; Sanders was given thirty days to replead, which would be denoted as an Answer in action 2002-CP-42-4362; and all matters were referred to the master.Â  Shortly thereafter, Sandersâ€™ attorney made his appearance, filed an Answer to Lancasterâ€™s foreclosure complaint, and served counterclaims.Â  \r\nThe master found Lancaster was owed $1,375.00 for labor performed by Lancaster and his two workmen.Â  The master also found Sanders agreed to pay Lancaster for supplying materials such as glue, lumber, gun nails, drive nails, and the cost of the equipment rental.Â  However, the master found that, because Sanders was acting as the contractor on the project, Lancaster could not also be the contractor and was not due the fifteen percent contractorâ€™s fee.Â  The master dismissed Sandersâ€™ counterclaims finding no contract existed that would provide a basis for breach of contract and, because Sanders was the contractor, the other claims should be dismissed as well.Â  The master awarded $1,000.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees to Lancaster as the prevailing party for a total award of $3,217.89 on the mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action to foreclose a mechanicâ€™s lien is an action at law in South Carolina.Â  Keeneyâ€™s Metal Roofing, Inc. v. Palmieri, 345 S.C. 550, 553, 548 S.E.2d 900, 901 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  In an action at law, the appellate court will correct any error of law, but it must affirm the masterâ€™s factual findings unless no evidence reasonably supports those findings.Â  Sea Cabins on the Ocean IV Homeowners Assâ€™n, Inc. v. City of N. Myrtle Beach, 337 S.C. 380, 388, 523 S.E.2d 193, 197 (Ct. App. 1999), affâ€™d in result by, 345 S.C. 380, 548 S.E.2d 595 (2001); Jeffries v. Phillips, 316 S.C. 523, 527, 451 S.E.2d 21, 22-23 (Ct. App. 1994); see also Waterpointe I Prop. Ownerâ€™s Assâ€™n , Inc. v. Paragon, Inc., 342 S.C. 454, 458, 536 S.E.2d 878, 880 (Ct. App. 2000) (stating that in an action at law for interpretation of a contract referred to the master-in-equity for final judgment, the appellate court will correct any error of law, but must affirm the masterâ€™s findings unless no evidence reasonably supports them).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Damages \r\nSanders contends the master erred in the amount of damages awarded under the mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nSpecifically, Sanders contends the master erred in awarding Lancaster damages for a day Sanders claims Lancaster did not work but which was listed on the Verified Statement of Account and claims the damages should be reduced because Lancaster failed to build a fireplace specified in the plans.[2]Â  The master ruled on these issues and found in favor of Lancaster.Â  In his order, the master made specific findings concerning the amount of money owed to Lancaster for his work on Sandersâ€™ project.Â  These findings were based on the Verified Statement of Account provided by Lancaster and the testimony presented at the hearing.Â  Accordingly, based on our standard of review and because the evidence supports the masterâ€™s findings, we find no error in the damages awarded to Lancaster.Â  See Sea Cabins, 337 S.C. at 388, 523 S.E.2d at 197.Â  \r\nSanders further contends the master erred in awarding $1,000.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees to Lancaster.Â  Section 29-5-20 of the South Carolina Code provides:Â  \r\n\r\nThe costs which may arise in enforcing or defending against the lien under this chapter, including a reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee, may be recovered by the prevailing party. The fee must be determined by the court in which the action is brought but the fee and the court costs may not exceed\r\nthe amount of the lien.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-20 (Supp. 2005).Â  Because Lancaster was clearly the prevailing party in that the master found the mechanicâ€™s lien against Sanders should be foreclosed, the master was correct in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees, which were reasonable in light of the evidence presented. \r\nII.&nbsp; Jury Trial \r\nSanders contends the master erred in deciding the issues raised in his counterclaim because he requested a jury trial on those issues.Â  We need not reach this issue. \r\nIf an order deprives a party of a mode of trial to which that party is entitled as a matter of right, the order is\r\nimmediately appealable and failure to do so forever bars appellate review. Â Flagstar Corp. v. Royal Surplus Lines, 341 S.C. 68, 72, 533 S.E.2d 331, 333 (2000); Foggie v. CSX Transp., Inc., 313 S.C. 98, ___, 431 S.E.2d 587, 590 (1993). Â Because Sanders failed to immediately appeal his denial of a jury trial when the order referring the case to the master was issued or at the very latest when the hearing began, Sanders is barred from raising this issue on appeal.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Mechanicâ€™s Lien \r\nSanders contends the master erred in foreclosing the mechanicâ€™s lien and ordering the sale of the subject property. Sanders further argues these actions were taken in order to intimidate him.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nPursuant to section 29-5-10 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005):Â  \r\n\r\n(a) A person to whom a debt is due for labor performed or furnished or for materials furnished and actually used in the erection, alteration, or repair of a building or structure upon real estate or the boring and equipping of wells, by virtue of an agreement with, or by consent of, the owner of the building or structure, or a person having authority from, or rightfully acting for, the owner in procuring or furnishing the labor or materials shall have a lien upon the building or structure and upon the interest of the owner of the building or structure in the lot of land upon which it is situated to secure the payment of the debt due to him.\r\n\r\nThe master found and the evidence supports Lancaster was owed money for work he performed on Sandersâ€™ property, making a mechanicâ€™s lien the appropriate remedy to recover those funds.Â  Accordingly, it is the nature of a foreclosure of a mechanicâ€™s lien to sell the subject property to satisfy the lien.Â  The master did not commit error in ordering the sale of the subject property because it was not done in an attempt to intimidate Sanders, but rather pursuant to the statute in order to satisfy the lien.Â  \r\nIV.&nbsp; Remaining Issues \r\nAs final issues, Sanders contends the master erred in failing to find both Sandersâ€™ and Lancasterâ€™s attorneys and the master guilty of civil racketeering, criminal misconduct, and judicial misconduct.Â  However, these issues have not been preserved for our review.Â  An issue not ruled upon by the trial court is not preserved for appeal.Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998).Â Â Â  Sanders failed to raise these issues to the master, thus failing to preserve the issues for our review.Â  Furthermore, even had these issues been preserved for our review, this court is not the appropriate forum to resolve such matters.Â  Sanders also raises the issues contained in his counterclaims throughout various portions of his brief.Â  However, this court will not consider arguments which are not set forth in the statement of issues on appeal.Â  See Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR.Â  Furthermore, Sanders fails to make any meaningful argument concerning these issues, but rather, merely cites brief portions of law with no supporting arguments rendering these issues abandoned and precludes our consideration of them on appeal.Â  See In re McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 92, 551 S.E.2d 235, 238 (2001) (stating that issues raised in a brief but not supported by argument are deemed abandoned and will not be considered on appeal).\r\nWe affirm the above issues pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities:Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (finding an issue not ruled upon by the trial judge is not preserved for appeal); Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (â€œOrdinarily, no point will be considered which is not set forth in the statement of the issues on appeal.â€); and In re McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 92, 551 S.E.2d 235, 238 (2001) (stating that issues raised in a brief but not supported by argument are deemed abandoned and will not be considered on appeal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the masterâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nHUFF, BEATTY, JJ., AND CURETON, A.J., CONCUR.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument, pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.&nbsp;\r\n[2] In discussing this issue, Sanders also makes arguments concerning judicial and attorney misconduct.Â  These issues are discussed below.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-432","title":"Hewett v.
