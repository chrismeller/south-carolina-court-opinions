Scarborough, Master In Equity\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-373\r\nHeard October 12, 2006 â€“ Filed November 2, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nBernard E. Ferrara, Jr. and Joseph Dawson, III, both of N. Charleston, for Appellant.Â  \r\nMelvin Richardson Hyman, Jr., of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this property action, Charleston County appeals the order finding it failed to establish ownership of a right of way through public dedication.Â  The county also contends the master erred in finding the plat was not properly indexed and therefore did not provide Respondents with notice of the right of way.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1980, Alonzo Rouse owned land in Charleston County adjacent to several thousand acres owned by Georgia Pacific Corporation. Â Rouse wanted to subdivide his land into several lots along a road then known as Old Sambo Road, now known as Julius Robertson Road.Â  In order to do so however, Charleston County regulations required frontage on a publicly dedicated fifty-foot right of way.Â  At the time, only a twenty-foot right of way existed.Â  \r\nOn October 21, 1981, Herbert Sass wrote a letter on behalf of Rouse to Richard George, General Manager of Georgia Pacific, seeking a thirty-foot dedication in order for Rouse to meet the countyâ€™s subdivision requirements.Â  Georgia-Pacific is a Georgia company and at the time had a subsidiary, Georgia Pacific Investment Company (GPIC), an Oregon company.Â  The two companies were separate business entities that maintained separate corporate formalities; however, the companies shared a common officer, Hiram Mersereau.Â  Mersereau was senior vice president of Georgia Pacific and vice president of\r\nGPIC.&nbsp; \r\nApparently some confusion existed as to whether Georgia Pacific or GPIC owned the land Rouse sought for the dedication.Â  On July 13, 1981, on Rouseâ€™s behalf, Forrest Calvert prepared a plat showing the proposed right of way.Â  The plat stated â€œWE HEREBY DEDICATE . . .â€ and under the dedication appeared the words â€œGeorgia Pacific Investment Company.â€Â  Under those words appears the signature of Mersereau, purporting to dedicate the right of way in his capacity as vice president of GPIC.Â  However, Georgia Pacific, not GPIC, held legal title to the land GPIC purportedly dedicated as the right of way.Â  The dedication provided:\r\n\r\nWe hereby dedicate this 50'[1] road right-of-way . . . to the use of the public forever.Â  The owners of these lots and their heirs and assigns, guarantee its maintenance until such time as it is accepted into a public maintenance system.Â  The approval of this plat in no way obligates the County of Charleston to accept the right-of-way for maintenance or construction.Â  \r\n\r\nOn November 1, 1982, the plat was recorded in the plat index under Rouseâ€™s name.Â  On November 16, Charleston County Council approved the plat.Â  \r\nOn March 31, 1989, Georgia Pacific sold property, including the purported right of way, to Dunes West Joint Venture by special warranty deed.Â  Georgia Pacific did not exempt the purported easement from the deedâ€™s warranty provisions.Â  \r\nFollowing a series of transfers that began in 1996, Beazer Homes purchased the land in 2001.Â  Beazer Homes developed and subdivided the property into six lots and sold them to Respondents by general warranty deeds. Â None of the six deeds referenced or excluded the purported right of way.Â  Since 2001, Respondents have lived in their respective homes and paid taxes on their property.Â  As late as January 2005, the county has taxed Respondentsâ€™ property, including the portion of their lots the county claims is a public right of way. Â \r\nIn 1996, the county proposed widening Julius Robertson Road by thirty feet.Â  The portion of property on which the county intended to widen the road is in Respondentsâ€™ back yards.Â  The county claimed ownership of the property through a publicly dedicated right of way. Â \r\nOn November 25, 2002, in response to the countyâ€™s claim of ownership, Respondents brought suit seeking a ruling that a right of way through public dedication did not exist because (1) the legal owner of the land did not perfect the dedication; and (2) the county did not accept the dedication.Â  Additionally, Respondents claimed they were bona fide purchasers without notice and were entitled to full ownership of their respective properties, including portions where the purported right of way existed.Â  \r\nThe county answered, contending inter alia, it acquired the right of way through a valid public dedication.Â  It further alleged Respondents had actual or constructive notice of the right of way because the plat was properly indexed.Â  \r\nAfter a trial on March 3, 2005, the master found the county did not establish ownership of the right of way through public dedication because the legal owner of the property, Georgia Pacific, did not make the dedication.Â  Further, the master found the county did not accept the proposed dedication in 1982 because at the time, section 6-7-1070 of the South Carolina Code provided:Â  â€œThe approval of a plat by the local planning commission shall not be deemed to constitute or effect an acceptance by the municipality or the county or the public of the dedication of any street or other ground shown upon the plat.â€[2]Â  The master reasoned that even if Georgia Pacific intended to dedicate the right of way, because mere approval of the plat did not constitute acceptance, Georgia Pacific revoked the offer when it sold the land including the purported right of way.Â  Further, the master concluded the countyâ€™s 1996 directive to widen Julius Robertson Road to include the area where the purported easement existed did not constitute acceptance because nothing was left to accept since (1) Georgia Pacific sold the land and (2) acceptance was not made within a reasonable amount of time.Â  \r\nThe master also found that, assuming the county had established a valid right of way through public dedication, the right of way was invalid against Respondents by virtue of the race-notice and indexing statutes.Â  The master found the plat that created the purported right of way was not properly indexed because it was not indexed under either Georgia Pacific or GPIC as grantor or under the county as grantee.Â  Therefore, because the plat was not properly indexed, the master concluded Respondents had no notice of the right of way.Â  Accordingly, Respondents were bona fide purchasers for value without notice and the right of way could not be asserted against them.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe determination of whether property has been dedicated to the public is an action in equity.â€Â  Van Blarcum v. City of N. Myrtle Beach,&nbsp; 337 S.C. 446, 450, 523 S.E.2d 486, 488&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1999) (citing State v. Beach Co., 271 S.C. 425, 248 S.E.2d 115 (1978)).Â  â€œBecause this is an action in equity referred to a master for final judgment, we may find facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Id. (citing Thomas v. Mitchell, 287 S.C. 35, 336 S.E.2d 154 (Ct. App. 1985)). Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n  \r\n  I.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Public Dedication\r\n    The county argues the master erred in finding it had not acquired a right of way through a valid public dedication.Â Â  We disagree.\r\n    In order to determine whether property has been dedicated for public use, the party seeking to establish the dedication must show â€œ[f]irst, the owner must\r\n    express in a positive and unmistakable manner the intention to dedicate his property to public use.Â  Second, there must be acceptance of such property by the public.â€Â  Tupper v. Dorchester County,&nbsp;326 S.C. 318, 326, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191-92&nbsp;(1997) (citing Helsel v. City of N. Myrtle Beach, 307 S.C. 24, 413 S.E.2d 821 (1992)).Â  Further, because dedication is an â€œexceptional manner of passing an interest in land[,]â€ proof of dedication must be strict, cogent, and convincing.Â  Tupper, 326 S.C. at 326, 487 S.E.2d at 192.Â  \r\n    Regarding the second element of perfecting a dedication, the acceptance must either be express or implied, and the acceptance must be made within a reasonable amount of time.Â  Helsel, 307 S.C. at 27, 413 S.E.2d at 823 (citing Outlaw v. Moise, 222 S.C. 24, 30, 71 S.E.2d 509, 511 (1952)).Â  Acceptance may be inferred from the publicâ€™s continuous use of the property or a public authorityâ€™s maintenance of the property.Â  Van Blarcum, 337 S.C. at 451, 523 S.E.2d at 489 (citing Tupper, 326 S.C. at 326, 487 S.E.2d at 192). \r\n    In the present case, the plat purportedly granted the right of way â€œto the use of the public forever.Â  The owners of these lots and their heirs and assigns, guarantee its maintenance until such time as it is accepted into a public maintenance system.â€Â  Further, the plat provides â€œ[t]he approval of this plat in no way obligates the County of Charleston to accept the right-of-way for maintenance or construction.â€Â  By the plain language of the plat, we find the dedication is to the public only.Â  The wording of the plat did not require any action on behalf of the county in order to accept the dedication.Â  Therefore, in this particular case, only the public could effectuate acceptance of the dedication and the only manner in which the public could have accepted the dedication would be through the publicâ€™s continuous use of the right of way.Â  We find no evidence suggesting the public has used the property in any manner.Â  In fact, the evidence shows that the property has been fenced off from Julius Robertson Road and used as Respondentsâ€™ respective residential back yards.Â  \r\n    Further, although not controlling on the issue of whether dedication has been accepted, the assessment of taxes is a factor to consider along with other evidence.Â  Van Blarcum, 337 S.C. at 452, 523 S.E.2d at 489 (citation omitted).Â  Here, taken together with the other evidence showing that the disputed right of way has been used by Respondents for their own private use, the countyâ€™s continuous assessment and collection of taxes on the property prevents it from claiming the property has been accepted by the public.Â  \r\n    Because we find there was no acceptance of the dedication, we need not address whether there was intent on the part of the actual owner, Georgia Pacific, to dedicate the property.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (finding an appellate court need not address remaining issues when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).\r\n    II.Â Â Â Â Â  Indexing\r\n    The county argues the master erred in finding that even if it had established the right of way had been publicly dedicated, the county could not assert its claim of ownership against Respondents because they were bona fide purchasers for value without notice.Â  We disagree.\r\n    Section 30-9-40 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) provides that immediately after the filing of a written instrument the register of deeds or clerk of court shall â€œenter it upon the proper indexes in his office, which constitute an integral, necessary, and inseparable part of the recordation of the deed, mortgage, or other written instrument for any and all purposes whatsoever.â€Â  Further, section 30-9-40 provides:\r\n\r\n    The entries in the indexes required to be made are notice to all persons sufficient to put them upon inquiry as to the purport and effect of the deed, mortgage, or other written instrument so filed for\r\n    record, but the recordation of a deed, mortgage, or other written instrument is not notice as to the purport and effect of the deed, mortgage, or other written instrument unless the filing of the instrument for record is entered as required in the indexes.\r\n\r\n    (emphasis added).Â  According to Section 30-9-40 â€œproper indexing supplies inquiry notice of an instrument, while recordation without proper indexing supplies no notice at all.â€Â  Thomas v. Thomas, 286 S.C. 294, 298, 333 S.E.2d 76, 78 (Ct. App. 1985) (citing Bradley v. Guess, 165 S.C. 161, 163 S.E.2d 466 (1932)).Â  \r\n    Section 30-9-10 of the South Carolina Code (Rev. 1991) establishes the manner in which to accomplish proper indexing and provides that an instrument conveying land should be indexed, alphabetically, under the names of the grantor and grantee.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-9-10 (â€œ[R]eference shall be had by means of two indexes, both containing the year of registry, names of parties, . . . the alphabetical arrangement of one being according to the names of the parties who executed the writings and of the other according to the names of the parties to whom they were executed.â€).Â  When construed together, sections 30-9-10 and 30-9-40 require that for an instrument conveying an interest in land to provide notice it must be indexed alphabetically under the names of both the grantee and grantor.Â  \r\n    Here, the plat was not properly indexed because it was indexed under the name of Rouse, who was neither grantor nor grantee of the extended right of way.Â  At trial, Respondents presented Lynda Sullivan as an expert witness in the area of title examination, chain of title, and real estate closing transactions.Â  She testified the plat was not indexed under the names Georgia Pacific, GPIC, or any variation thereof.Â  Nor was the plat indexed under the countyâ€™s name as grantee.Â  She testified the plat was indexed under Rouseâ€™s name, and he was neither grantor nor grantee of the disputed right of way.Â  Further, she testified that the common practice is to search the subject property but not adjoining properties.Â  Sullivan also testified that the plat creating the purported right of way was not in the chain of title for the property.Â  After reviewing the evidence we agree the plat was not properly indexed and, therefore, did not provide Respondents with notice that the county had a right of way in the properties Respondents subsequently purchased.Â  \r\n    CONCLUSION\r\n    For the foregoing reasons, we find the master correctly concluded that the county failed to establish public dedication of the right of way.Â  Further, we find the plat was not properly indexed and, thus, failed to provide Respondents with notice.Â  As bona fide purchasers for value without notice, the countyâ€™s claim of ownership of the right of way cannot prevail as against Respondentsâ€™ titles.Â  The masterâ€™s order is \r\n    AFFIRMED.Â  \r\n    HEARN, C.J., STILWELL, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  The actual purported dedication is only thirty feet.Â  \r\n[2] Â Â Â Â Â Â  This statue was repealed in 1999.Â  See 1994 Act No. 355, Â§ 2, effective May 3, 1999.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-374","title":"Tennant v.

Avant, and Paul M. Koch, of Columbia; for Respondents. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Charles R. Richards and James M. Tennant (collectively Appellants) appeal the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to the County of Georgetown (County) and the South Carolina Budget and Control Board in Appellantsâ€™ suit seeking a declaratory judgment setting aside Countyâ€™s 911 Ordinance.[1]Â  In addition, Appellants appeal the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to Jack M. Scoville, Jr. for abuse of process, and Scoville, Thomas W. Edwards, Jr., and James M. Mock, Jr. for intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn September 18, 2001, County enacted an ordinance (the Ordinance) authorizing the collection of a $1.00 per month fee (Fee) on each telephone line within its jurisdiction to fund improvements to its Emergency 911 System. Â The Ordinance does not specifically direct how the Fee will be spent.Â  To authorize expenditures from money raised with the Fee, County created a proposed â€œEnhanced 911 System Planâ€ (the Plan).Â  On November 16, 2002, the County submitted the Plan, which showed a revenue surplus, to the Office of Information Resource of the State Budget and Control Board (the Board) for approval.Â  \r\nBefore the Board approved the Plan, Appellants filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment of the illegality of the Fee, arguing it would be used to fund a radio communications system allegedly unauthorized by statute.Â  While the record shows the County considered funding this system using the Fee, the Plan submitted to the Board contained no such provision.Â  Scoville, the Countyâ€™s attorney, moved for sanctions, alleging the frivolity of the suit.Â  Appellants filed a cross-motion for sanctions against Scoville.Â  The circuit court did not grant either motion.\r\nThe County moved to dismiss the action.Â  The circuit court held a hearing and dismissed Appellantsâ€™ case without prejudice, basing its decision on the fact the Board had not considered or approved the Plan, and therefore, the controversy lacked ripeness.Â  \r\nIn the ensuing months, the County and the Board engaged in a healthy dialogue regarding the Plan.Â  Specifically, the County indicated it would seek approval for future expenditures not included in the Plan and would lower the Fee if a revenue surplus occurred.Â  Appellants also contacted the Board with respect to the Plan.Â  On July 12, 2002, the Board approved the Plan.Â  \r\nOn September 24, 2002, the County held a meeting at which it approved the expenditure of Fee revenues on the contemplated radio communications system.Â  The parties do not dispute that this radio system would be used to contact emergency response personnel after the County received a 911 call.Â  Mock, the Director of Emergency Services for the County, requested the Boardâ€™s approval for this expenditure.Â  The Board approved the proposal.Â  \r\nIn response, Appellants filed an amended complaint seeking to set aside the Fee and the Plan because the Countyâ€™s expenditure of funds on a radio system allegedly violated statutory authority.[2]Â  Appellants named Mock and Edwards, Countyâ€™s Administrator, as parties for their role in obtaining the Boardâ€™s approval.Â  Appellants argued Mock and Edwards falsified the original, unedited Plan by failing to include the proposal to use part of the funds to pay for the radio system.Â  In addition, Appellants sought a declaratory judgment that the County acted outside their statutory authority in authorizing the expenditure of the Fee on the radio system, the Board illegally approved of this expenditure, and the Public Service Commission (PSC) failed to regulate this expenditure.[3]Â  Â Â \r\nMoreover, Appellants alleged County violated the prior circuit court order by collecting the Fee before seeking Board approval for the radio system.Â  Furthermore, Appellants sought damages for abuse of process against Scoville and for intentional infliction of emotional distress against Scoville, Mock, and Edwards.Â  The Board answered and moved to dismiss the amended complaint.Â  Subsequently, the County, Scoville, Edwards, and Mock also answered.Â  Scoville and Edwards also filed counterclaims for libel, slander, and civil conspiracy.\r\nOn January 21, 2004, the circuit court converted the Boardâ€™s motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment.Â  Appellants moved to amend their complaint a second time, to dismiss Scovilleâ€™s and Edwardsâ€™ counterclaims, and to request a discovery conference.Â  The County, Scoville, Edwards, and Mock later moved for summary judgment.Â Â Â  \r\nThe circuit court held a hearing and granted summary judgment against Appellants on all of their causes of action.Â  In addition, the circuit court dismissed Scovilleâ€™s and Mockâ€™s counterclaims.Â  Appellants, Scoville, and Mock filed motions to reconsider.Â  The circuit court held a hearing on these motions.Â  After the hearing but before the circuit court issued a decision, Appellants filed a motion to stay the case and for recusal of the judge.Â  The circuit court denied all of Appellantsâ€™ motions but reversed its order dismissing Scovilleâ€™s and Mockâ€™s counterclaims.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn appellate court reviews the grant of summary judgment under the same standard applied by the circuit court.Â  David v. McLeod Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 247, 626 S.E.2d 1, 3&nbsp;(2006).Â  The circuit court should grant summary judgment â€œif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€ Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Byrd v. City of Hartsville, 365 S.C. 650, 656, 620 S.E.2d 76, 79&nbsp;(2005).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Law v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648&nbsp;(2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. The Public Safety Communications Center Act\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred in holding the Public Safety Communications Center Act, sections 23-47-10 to -80 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) (the Act), allows the County to enact the Fee and use revenues on the radio system.Â  We disagree.\r\nThis court may determine the issue of legislative intent as a matter of law.Â  Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, 67, 459 S.E.2d 841, 843&nbsp;(1995).Â  â€œWhen the language of a statute is plain, unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are unnecessary and the court may not impose another meaning.â€Â  S.C. Uninsured Employerâ€™s Fund v. House, 360 S.C. 468, 472, 602 S.E.2d 81, 83&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).\r\nA local government, including a county, seeking to impose a fee for its emergency telephone system, or â€œ911 system,â€ must submit a â€œ911 system planâ€ to the Board for approval.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-47-30(A) (Supp. 2005); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-47-10 (Supp. 2005) (defining â€œlocal government,â€ â€œ911 system,â€ â€œ911 system plan,â€ and other statutory terms with respect to the Act).Â  A 911 system must include â€œequipment to connect the PSAP [the facility receiving 911 calls] to all law enforcement, fire protection, and emergency medical or rescue agencies, or both . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-47-20(C)(2) (amended by Act No. 317, 2006 S.C. Acts 317, effective May 30, 2006).Â  \r\nTo help fund its 911 system, a local government may adopt an ordinance imposing a monthly fee on telephone lines within the locality.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-47-40(A) (Supp. 2005).Â  This fee may be used only to pay for certain enumerated items, including â€œitems necessary to meet the standards outlined . . . specifically in Section 23-47-20(C) . . . .â€Â  Â§ 23-47-40(B).Â  Â Â \r\nIn this case, the County adopted an ordinance pursuant to section 23-47-40(A) to establish the Fee.Â  The County then submitted the Plan to the Board to comply with section 23-47-30(A).Â  After the Board approved the Plan, the County sought to spend revenue from the Fee on the radio system to allow its PSAP to directly contact and dispatch local emergency responders.Â  Appellants specifically contend the County cannot spend the Fee on the radio system because (1) the Act only allows this type of revenue to be spent on telephone communications; (2) the radio system might be used for other types of communication apart from contacting emergency response personnel; and (3) the PSC must approve of all equipment upon which the County spends this type of revenue. Â \r\nSection 23-47-20(C)(2) does not limit the type of equipment required to connect the PSAP to emergency responders.Â  Accordingly, we refuse to read a limitation requiring only telephone equipment be used.Â  We also find no limitation in the Act requiring the equipment used in section 23-47-20(C)(2) be used only to connect the PSAP to emergency personnel.[4]Â  Furthermore, the Act does not require the PSC to regulate the equipment designated in section 23-47-20(C)(2).Â  Based on the foregoing, we hold the circuit court properly granted summary judgment to the County and the Board on Appellantsâ€™ declaratory judgment action.\r\nAppellants also argue the circuit court erred in finding a Board employeeâ€™s letter interpreting the Act and an informal opinion made by an assistant attorney general supported its decision.Â  Because we hold the Act plainly allows the expenditure here, we decline to address these issues.\r\nII. Abuse of Process\r\nAppellants contend the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment on their abuse of process claim.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe essential elements of abuse of process are an ulterior purpose and a willful act in the use of the process not proper in the conduct of the proceeding.Â  Hainer v. Am. Med. Intâ€™l, Inc., 328 S.C. 128, 136, 492 S.E.2d 103, 107&nbsp;(1997).Â  Appellants merely argue Scoville acted outside the scope of his authority in bringing the sanctions motion in Appellantsâ€™ first suit.Â  Appellants do not argue Scoville had an ulterior purpose in filing this motion or that the motion was improper in the conduct of the proceeding.Â  Accordingly, we hold the circuit court properly granted summary judgment on Appellantsâ€™ abuse of process claim.\r\nIII. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\r\nAppellants claim the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment on their claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  We disagree.\r\nA personâ€™s willful, malicious conduct proximately causing anotherâ€™s emotional distress may be actionable as\r\nintentional infliction of emotional distress or the tort of outrage.Â  Williams v. Lancaster County Sch. Dist., 369 S.C. 293, ___, 631 S.E.2d 286, 293&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).Â  To state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must show (1) the defendant intentionally or recklessly inflicted severe emotional distress, or was certain or substantially certain that such distress would result from his conduct; (2) the conduct was so extreme and outrageous as to exceed all possible bounds of decency and must be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community; (3) the actions of defendant caused the plaintiffâ€™s emotional distress; and (4) the emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff was so severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.Â  Bergstrom v. Palmetto Health Alliance, 358 S.C. 388, 401, 596 S.E.2d 42, 48&nbsp;(2004).Â  â€œThe court determines, in the first instance, whether the defendantâ€™s conduct may reasonably be regarded as sufficiently extreme and outrageous to permit recovery.Â  Only when reasonable persons may differ will the question proceed to the jury.â€Â Â  Brown v. Pearson, 326 S.C. 409, 424, 483 S.E.2d 477, 485&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997).\r\nAppellants allege the actions of Scoville, Mock, and Edwards in filing a motion for sanctions and â€œillegallyâ€ or â€œfraudulentlyâ€ seeking the Boardâ€™s approval to use the Fee to pay for a radio system caused them emotional distress.Â  As a matter of law, we hold this conduct is not sufficiently extreme or outrageous to permit recovery.Â  \r\nIV. Genuine Issues of Material Fact\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment because genuine issues of material fact exist.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, Appellants assert the legislative intent behind the Act creates a genuine issue of material fact.Â  However, South Carolina has long recognized the determination of legislative intent is a matter of law for the courts.Â  See, e.g., Wehle v. S.C. Ret. Sys., 363 S.C. 394, 403, 611 S.E.2d 240, 244&nbsp;(2005).Â  \r\nAppellants next argue â€œthe mere existence of the disputed Ted Lightle letter is a genuine issue of material fact.â€Â  The existence of this letter, contained in the record, does not appear to be disputed by either party.Â  \r\nFinally, Appellants claim Scovilleâ€™s assertion at the circuit courtâ€™s hearing on summary judgment that the Countyâ€™s radio system would be used at least fifty percent of the time for 911 purposes generated a genuine issue of material fact.Â  However, this assertion is irrelevant to the present controversy because, as we have stated, the Act does not require such a showing.\r\nV. Discovery\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment before allowing them to complete discovery.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œSince it is a drastic remedy, summary judgment â€˜should be cautiously invoked so that no person will be improperly deprived of a trial of the disputed factual issues.â€™ â€Â  Baughman v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co.,&nbsp;306 S.C. 101, 112, 410 S.E.2d 537, 543&nbsp;(1991) (quoting Watson v. S. Ry. Co., 420 F.Supp. 483, 486 (D.S.C. 1975)).Â  â€œThis means, among other things, that summary judgment must not be granted until the opposing party has had a full and fair opportunity to complete discovery.â€Â  Baughman, 306 S.C. at 112, 410 S.E.2d at 543.Â  In making this determination, the circuit court should consider whether the party opposing summary judgment can â€œ[demonstrate] a likelihood that further discovery will uncover additional evidence relevant to the issue . . . and [the party is] not merely engaged in a â€˜fishing expedition.â€™ â€Â  Id.\r\nHere, Appellants filed a request for a discovery conference, listing several proposed depositions and explaining three issues they wanted to explore.Â  Appellants sought information with respect to the scope of Scovilleâ€™s, Mockâ€™s, and Edwardsâ€™ authority; efforts made by the PSC, the Board, and the County to comply with the circuit courtâ€™s decree dismissing Appellantsâ€™ original claims without prejudice; and efforts made by the PSC, the Board, and the County to comply with statutory authority.Â  None of these issues are relevant to the outcome of this case.Â  Accordingly, we hold the circuit court properly granted summary judgment without allowing this discovery request.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nVI. Miscellaneous Factual Issues\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred in finding the County could not afford the radio system without using the Fee and holding improvements to the 911 system could not be accomplished without the radio system.Â  These findings of fact are irrelevant to this appeal.Â  The Act does not require either of these findings before the County may spend 911 funds on the radio system.Â  â€œ[W]hatever doesnâ€™t make any difference, doesnâ€™t matter.â€Â \r\nMcCall v. Finley, 294 S.C. 1, 4, 362 S.E.2d 26, 28&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1987).\r\nVII. Fraudulent Conduct\r\nAppellants claim the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment because evidence exists that the County made misrepresentations and submitted fraudulent documents to the Board.Â  We disagree.\r\nEssentially, Appellants argue the County was required to submit its proposal to use the Fee for a radio system at the same time it submitted the Plan.Â  Consequently, they contend the failure of the County to mention the proposed radio system to the Board at the time it submitted the Plan constituted misrepresentation or fraud.Â  Appellants cite no authority for their proposition that the County had to include information about the radio system in their submission to the Board, nor do we find any.Â  See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514&nbsp;(1994) (holding when an appellant does not argue or provide supporting authority for his assertion, he abandons the assertion).Â  In addition, Appellants presented no evidence of any fraud or misrepresentation.Â  Therefore, we hold the circuit court properly held no evidence existed of fraud or misrepresentation. \r\nVIII. Motion to Amend\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred in denying their motion to amend the complaint.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œ[A] motion to amend a pleading is addressed to the discretion of the trial judge, and the party opposing the motion has the burden of establishing prejudice.â€Â  Stanley v. Kirkpatrick, 357 S.C. 169, 174, 592 S.E.2d 296, 298&nbsp;(2004).Â  According to Appellantsâ€™ argument on appeal, the circuit court dismissed their cause of action for contempt and dismissed the PSC as a party.[5]Â  The preamble to Appellantsâ€™ second amended complaint explains they desired to rename the PSC as a party and include two causes of action replacing the contempt claim.Â  Because the circuit courtâ€™s order is not included in the record, this Court cannot determine whether the dismissal was with or without prejudice.Â  â€œIt is the\r\nappellantâ€™s burden to present a sufficient record for appellate review.â€Â  Webb v. CSX Transp., Inc., 364 S.C. 639, 655, 615 S.E.2d 440, 449&nbsp;(2005).Â  Â Â \r\nMoreover, Appellants sought to name Jeffrey K. Herron, the employee of the Board who approved of the Countyâ€™s proposals, and the Director of the PSC as parties.Â  The substance of Appellantsâ€™ allegations against these parties is the same as those leveled at the Board and the PSC.Â  We reiterate these allegations are unmeritorious.Â  Therefore, we hold the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellantsâ€™ motion to amend.\r\nIX. Motion to Recuse\r\nAppellants claim the circuit court erred in denying their motion to recuse.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe decision to recuse rests within the trial judgeâ€™s discretion.Â  Ness v. Eckerd Corp., 350 S.C. 399, 404, 566 S.E.2d 193, 196&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œWhen no evidence is presented other than claimed â€˜adverseâ€™ rulings by the judge, the judge is not required to recuse himself.â€Â  Reading v. Ball, 291 S.C. 492, 494, 354 S.E.2d 397, 398&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1987).Â  However, a judgeâ€™s impartiality might reasonably be questioned when his factual findings are not supported by the record.Â  Ellis v. Procter &amp; Gamble Distrib. Co., 315 S.C. 283, 285, 433 S.E.2d 856, 857&nbsp;(1993).\r\nAppellants argue the judgeâ€™s comments asking the Board for an affidavit and the judgeâ€™s ruling that the Act authorized the Countyâ€™s expenditure on a radio system show the judgeâ€™s partiality.Â  Additionally, Appellants contend the judge showed prejudice when he remarked about the propriety of combining a declaratory judgment action with a tort action.Â  The affidavit, which the Board later submitted, simply restated the Boardâ€™s position that the radio system had been approved.Â  However, the parties did not dispute whether the Board approved this expenditure.Â  Moreover, the judgeâ€™s ruling that the Act authorized Countyâ€™s expenditure has been affirmed by this court.Â  Furthermore, the judge never prevented Appellants from arguing all of their causes of action.Â  Accordingly, we find the judge did not err in failing to recuse himself.[6]  \r\nX. Scovilleâ€™s and Edwardsâ€™ Counterclaims\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred in reversing its grant of summary judgment with respect to Scovilleâ€™s and Edwardsâ€™ counterclaims.Â  A party may not appeal the denial of summary judgment, even when combined with an appeal of a final order.Â  Olson v. Faculty House of Carolina, Inc., 354 S.C. 161, 167, 580 S.E.2d 440, 443&nbsp;(2003).Â  Therefore, we do not address this issue.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the plain language of the Act allows the County to spend revenues from the Fee on a radio communications system intended to allow its PSAP to contact and dispatch emergency personnel.Â  In addition, we find Appellants failed to state causes of action for abuse of process or intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  Appellantsâ€™ other factual allegations are irrelevant to this appeal.Â  \r\nWe further hold Appellants failed to show any genuine issues of material fact or a need for further discovery.Â  Moreover, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellantsâ€™ motion to amend or motion to recuse.Â  Finally, we refuse to address Appellantsâ€™ appeal from a denial of summary judgment.Â  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s order is \r\nAFFIRMED.[7]\r\nGOOLSBY, BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Appellants included several members of Countyâ€™s council in their complaint.Â  Because they are named in their official capacities, we include them as part of County.\r\n[2] Appellants do not include their original complaint in the record.Â  \r\n[3] A previous circuit court order, not included in the record, dismisses PSC as a party.Â  (R.95).\r\n[4] Alternatively, Appellants argue a 1992 letter from a Board employee requires at least fifty percent of the radio systemâ€™s use be for 911 purposes.Â  No such limitation exists within the Act.\r\n[5] Appellants do not include this order in the record.\r\n[6] Appellants also appeal the circuit courtâ€™s denial of their motion to stay the present action and argue the judge lacked impartiality.Â  We find these issues subsumed within Appellantsâ€™ argument the judge should have recused himself.Â  Accordingly, our holding with respect to recusal is dispositive.Â  \r\n[7] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-375","title":"State v.

Mathews, of Ridgeland, for Appellant.\r\nR. Thayer Rivers, of Ridgeland, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Brenda Jones appeals the special refereeâ€™s order finding that her use (along with that of her predecessors in ownership) of Lake Daleyâ€™s property for ingress and egress to her adjoining property did not create an easement by prescription.Â  The special referee found Jones failed to prove twenty years of continuous usage of the alleged easement.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThis case comes to us on appeal for a second time, having previously been reversed by the court of appeals and remanded to the special referee for a determination as to whether the use of the alleged easement by Jones and her predecessors was continuous for a twenty year period.Â  While new testimony, evidence, and arguments were presented at the second hearing, on remand, the transcript and exhibits of the first hearing were also available for consideration by the special referee.\r\nThe alleged dominant property (â€œthe Jones Parcelâ€) is a five acre tract of land in Jasper County acquired by Brenda Jonesâ€™ great uncle, Thomas Washington, in 1939. Â In 1963, Thomas gave this parcel to his daughter, Jonesâ€™ aunt Jannie Washington.Â  Ms. Washington granted the property to Jones, transferring a one-half interest in 1982 and the remaining half in 1993.\r\nThe alleged servient land (â€œthe Daley Parcelâ€) is a two hundred acre tract, located, in part, on the western boundary of Jonesâ€™ property.Â  At the time of Thomas Washingtonâ€™s acquisition of the Jones Parcel, the Daley Parcel was owned by Union Camp.Â  In 1987, the land was sold to Delta Plantation and was subsequently purchased by Lake Daley in the late 1990s. \r\nThroughout the Washington/Jones familyâ€™s ownership of the Jones Parcel, the property has been landlocked.Â  However, the land was accessed by means of other surrounding properties.Â  When, where, how, and to what frequency this land was accessed is central to this dispute.Â  \r\nOne possible means of access to the property was by use of a trail that followed the northern and eastern boundary of the Daley Parcel and the nearest public road, located to the west of both properties. Â This path, which follows the outer borders of the Daley Parcel but is situated entirely within its boundaries, is the alleged prescriptive easement and the route that Jones asserts was used continuously for a period of twenty years.Â  According to the testimony of Jones and her witnesses, this path existed since the time of Thomas Washingtonâ€™s acquisition of the five acre property in 1939.Â  It is also their testimony that the family began using the path at that time.Â  \r\nAt some point in the early 1950s, Union Camp began periodically plowing the preexisting access trail for the purpose of creating a firebreak or â€œfire lane.â€Â  Jones and her witnesses contend that following Union Campâ€™s tilling, the Washingtons would work the freshly plowed path with shovels, leveling out the newly cleared trail to make the path more suitable for ingress and egress to their property. Â The Washingtons never requested permission to use the trail because they believed, since the trail was the only access to their property, they had a valid legal right to maintain and use it in order to reach their land.Â  Union Camp, the owner of the Daley Parcel for most of the time period at issue, was aware of the Washingtonsâ€™ use and maintenance of the trail and fully condoned it during the time in which it was used.Â Â Â  \r\nAt the initial hearing, Jonesâ€™ uncle, Peter Washington, who worked the Jones Parcel with his father, original owner Thomas Washington, testified the family actively farmed Jones parcel from at least the late 1950s.Â  During their testimony, Jonesâ€™ other two uncles made no attempt to dispute this information.Â  In contrast to his earlier statement, during the second hearing, Peter Washington testified that his father farmed the land until the early 1980s. \r\nRegardless of the date, after the Washingtons ceased farming the Jones Parcel, their use of the trail became less frequent in the decades that followed.Â  They testified, however, that they continued to periodically visit the property and maintain the trail following Union Campâ€™s plowing. Â Jones, age 46, testified the trail was used by her family to access the parcel â€œas far back as [she] remembered,â€ and she specifically recalled using the access herself since the 1970s or 1980s.Â  However, because Jones did not reside in Jasper County, or even South Carolina, during her youth, her visits to the property, though numerous, were sporadic. Â Johnny Scott, a nearby resident since the 1960s, testified that the trailâ€™s use to reach â€œburiedâ€ property was common community knowledge.\r\nIn the mid-1990s, Delta Plantation, then current owner of the Daley Parcel, decided to close a road used by several other â€œburiedâ€ landowners to cross over the two hundred acre property. Â This road did not connect to the Jones Parcel.Â  To satisfy landowners who possessed recorded easements over the closed road, the northern access trail, the path used by the Washington family, was expanded into a full-sized road and all landowners with recorded easements over the closed road were granted written easements over the newly created one. Â This road did not connect to the Jones Parcel.Â  Because Jones did not have a recorded easement to use the closed road, she was not granted a written easement to use the road built over her parcelâ€™s only access.Â  \r\nC.M. Dansler, an employee for Delta Plantation, who worked on the 1990s trail expansion, testified as to the state of the trail when they decided to build the new road.Â  He stated he had maintained and expanded the firebreak since the beginning of his employment in 1987. Â Nevertheless, when asked if the new road was built over an existing road, he stated, â€œNo . . . there was a fireline, but just barely.â€ Â Although he opined that the path was about eight feet wide in places and would be traversable by a small tractor, he testified that by the mid-90s the trail was nothing more than a â€œdeer trail.â€ \r\nIn 2001, Jones attempted to haul timber from her parcel over the newly expanded road.Â  Daley objected to this activity.Â  In 2002, Jones brought an action against Daley to declare an easement by prescription for ingress and egress over the road.Â  The appointed special referee found no easement by prescription was created by Jones and her predecessorsâ€™ prior use.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe determination of the existence of an easement is a question of fact in an action at law. Â Slear v. Hanna, 329 S.C. 407, 496 S.E.2d 633, (1998); Jowers v.Â  Hornsby, 292 S.C. 549, 551, 357 S.E.2d 710, 711 (1987); Hartley v. John Wesley United Methodist Church of Johns Island, 355 S.C. 145, 148, 584 S.E.2d 386, 387 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  In an action at law tried without a jury, the judgeâ€™s finding of fact will not be disturbed on appeal unless there is no evidence to support the judgeâ€™s findings.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 85-86, 221 S.E.2d 733, 775 (1976); Goodwin v. Johnson, 357 S.C. 49, 52-53, 591 S.E.2d 34, 36 (Ct. App. 2004); Roberts v. Gaskins, 327 S.C. 478, 486 S.E.2d 771, (Ct. App. 1997). Â Â The present matter was consensually referred to a special referee.Â  Accordingly, our scope of review is limited to the correction of errors of law, and we will not disturb the refereeâ€™s factual findings that have some evidentiary support.Â  Townes, 266 S.C. at 85-86, 221 S.E.2d at 775; Hartley, 355 S.C. at 148, 584 S.E.2d at 387. \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nOn appeal, Jones argues the special referee erred in finding she failed to prove her usage (and/or that of her predecessors in title) of the Daley parcel was continuous for the required period.Â  Specifically, Jones contends the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence presented was that Thomas Washington and his children and grandchild used the route at issue on Daleyâ€™s land as the only means of ingress and egress to their property and that this use was continuous and without interruption for at least twenty years.Â  We disagree.\r\nAlthough it is Jonesâ€™ contention that the purported easement was in use since at least 1939, the special referee found differently, ruling that at the very earliest, any use of the purported easement did not begin until 1949.Â  There is evidence in the record to support the refereeâ€™s finding.Â  \r\nJones and her witnesses specifically and repeatedly referenced a twenty-one acre plot of land they called â€œthe home place,â€ which bordered on the northern boundary of Daleyâ€™s property.Â  This â€œhome placeâ€ was to the north of and directly adjacent to a large section of the alleged easement that Jones claims was used to access the Jones Parcel since 1939.Â  However, the Washington/Jones family did not acquire the land referred to as the â€œhome placeâ€ until 1949.Â  An earlier, completely different â€œhome placeâ€ for the Washington/Jones family once sat directly to the east of the Daley parcel and to the south of, although not adjacent to, the Jones Parcel.Â  This earlier â€œhome placeâ€ was lost due to tax forfeiture sometime prior to the 1949 acquisition of the current â€œhome place.â€\r\nPeter Washington testified that during his familyâ€™s ownership of the first â€œhome place,â€ he and other relatives were able to and did access the Jones Parcel by way of a different fire lane.Â  This path ran directly north from the original â€œhome placeâ€ until it reached the five acre Jones Parcel.Â  This being a different route from the one which Jones claims was used to ingress and egress the Jones Parcel from 1939 onward, there was evidence in the record to support a finding by the special referee that any use of the purported easement did not begin until, at the earliest, the Washingtonâ€™s/Jonesâ€™ acquisition of the current â€œhome placeâ€ in 1949.Â  \r\nAlthough Jones argues that the evidence only allows for a conclusion that the purported easement was in use until 1980, there is evidence in the record to support the refereeâ€™s finding that continuous use of the path ceased much earlier. Â \r\nWhen asked at the first hearing, â€œSo when did yâ€™all quit farming the five acres,â€ Peter Washington responded â€œLate fiftiesâ€¦ â€™59.â€ Â In the second hearing, Mr. Washington testified that his father farmed the land until around 1980. Â Although he explained this inconsistency with his previous statement as a misunderstanding as to what was meant by the word â€œyâ€™all,â€ Mr. Washingtonâ€™s testimony provided evidence on which the special referee could find that the family ceased farming operations on the Jones Parcel in 1959, particularly in light of the fact that the referee found this inconsistency to have impeached Mr. Washington.\r\nThe special referee found â€œthere was no clear, direct and credible testimony by [Jones] and her witnesses as to dates, months, years, times or frequency of [Jonesâ€™] visitation and her predecessorâ€™s visitation to her 5 acre parcel of property by usage of the â€˜fire laneâ€™ during the periods of time in the 1960â€™s, 1970â€™s, 1980â€™s, and 1990â€™sâ€¦â€Â  There was evidence to support this finding.Â  After the point in time when her family quit farming the land, Jones presented very little evidence as to use of the path over Daley Parcel.Â  Additionally, what evidence there was, suggested only sporadic visits to the land.Â  The burden of proving a easement by prescription is on the party relying thereon.Â  Morrow v. Dyches, 328 S.C. 522, 492 S.E.2d 420 (Ct. App. 1997); see also Matthews v. Dennis, 365 S.C. 245, 251, 616 S.E.2d 437, 440-41 (Ct. App. 2005) (stating the plaintiffs had the â€œburden of proof in establishing their right to a prescriptive easementâ€).Â  Thus, the special referee could reasonably have found that Jones did to meet her burden of proving her and her familyâ€™s use of the purported easement was continuous after 1959.\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nThere was evidence on which the special referee could base his finding that Jonesâ€™ predecessorâ€™s use of the purported easement did not begin until 1949 and ended, much less than twenty years later, in 1959.Â  Furthermore, the evidence also justified a finding that any use of the route that took place after 1959 was not sufficiently proven to be continuous and uninterrupted for the requisite time period. Â There was ample evidence to support the special refereeâ€™s finding that a prescriptive easement was not established.Â  Accordingly, and the special refereeâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-377","title":"Curry v.

McKnight, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nMorris A. Ellison, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Kay Curry appeals the masterâ€™s order dismissing her foreclosure action against Andrew Manigault, d/b/a Manigault Estate Corporation, LLC, and denying her unjust enrichment claim.Â  We reverse and remand.Â  \r\nI.\r\nIn 1988, Manigault and his two brothers, Robert Manigault (â€œRobertâ€) and John Manigault (â€œJohnâ€), formed Awendaw Creek Associates (â€œPartnershipâ€).Â  In 1993, the Partnership executed a promissory note (â€œNoteâ€) with South Carolina National Bank (â€œSNBâ€) for $446,987.Â  The Note was secured by a mortgage on 123 acres of Partnership property (â€œMortgageâ€), an assignment of contracts, and an assignment of leases, rents, and profits.Â  \r\nIn 1998, the Partnership and John Sanders (a financial backer) entered into a modification and extension agreement (â€œAgreementâ€) with SNBâ€™s successor in interest, Wachovia.Â  Under the Agreement, the Partnership and Sanders agreed to make quarterly payments of $17,092 to Wachovia until March 3, 2003, the Noteâ€™s maturity date.Â  Manigault, Robert, John, and Sanders all agreed to guarantee payments on the Note.Â  \r\nIn 2001, Curry negotiated with Robert and John about purchasing Partnership property.[1]Â  Robert and John agreed to sell their portion of the Partnership property to Curry, but Andrew Manigault refused to sell his portion to her.Â  Consequently, on October 25, 2001, Curry purchased Robertâ€™s and Johnâ€™s portion of the Partnership property, but not Andrew Manigaultâ€™s.Â  Because Wachovia would not release any of the Partnership property from the Mortgage unless the Note was paid in full, Curry agreed to purchase the Note and release Robert, John, and Sanders from the Mortgage, but not Manigault, who would continue to owe his balance of the Note.Â  \r\nOn November 16, 2001, Wachovia sent David Chard, the attorney handling the transaction between Curry, Robert, and John, a message indicating $346,783 would â€œpayoffâ€ the Note.Â  Three days later, Chard sent Wachovia a check for $346,783.Â  Chard also sent Wachovia a letter stating the check represented the â€œpayoffâ€ of the Note.Â  The letter further provided, â€œAs soon as possible after processing the enclosed check, please forward to us the original Note and Mortgage marked â€˜Paid and Satisfied In Fullâ€™ in order that we may have the same cancelled of record.â€Â  Although Curry unquestionably â€œpaid offâ€ the Note, she never received from Wachovia the original Note nor any correspondence related to the original Note.Â  \r\nOn March 4, 2002, Wachovia executed an â€œAssignment of Mortgage,â€ which by its terms assigned and transferred the Note and Mortgage to Curry.Â  Curry then sought to foreclose the mortgage on Manigaultâ€™s property, because Manigault did not pay Curry the amount she paid Wachovia for his share of the Noteâ€™s balance.Â  The matter was referred to the master.Â  At trial, Curry attempted to admit into evidence a copy of the Note, but Manigault objected based on a specific provision of the Uniform Commercial Code (â€œUCCâ€).Â  The master sustained Manigaultâ€™s objection.Â  Curry amended her pleadings, without objection, to include a claim for unjust enrichment.Â  In May 2005, the master dismissed Curryâ€™s foreclosure action and denied her claim for unjust enrichment.Â  Curry appealed.Â  \r\nII.\r\nAn action to recover under an unjust enrichment claim sounds in equity.Â  Columbia Wholesale Co. v. Scudder May, 312 S.C. 259, 261, 440 S.E.2d 129, 130 (1994).Â  In an appeal from a masterâ€™s final judgment, this Court has the same standard of review as if the appeal had come from the circuit court without a jury.Â  Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 237, 391 S.E.2d 538, 543&nbsp;(1989).Â  â€œIn an action in equity tried by the judge alone, this Court can make findings of facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â \r\nQHG of Lake City, Inc. v. McCutcheon, 360 S.C. 196, 202, 600 S.E.2d 105, 107 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nIII.\r\nCurry argues the master erred in denying her unjust enrichment claim.Â  We agree and find Curry is entitled to recover on her unjust enrichment claim.Â Â  \r\nâ€œUnjust enrichment is an equitable doctrine, akin to restitution, which permits the recovery of that amount the defendant has been unjustly enriched at the expense of the plaintiff.â€Â  Ellis v. Smith Grading &amp; Paving, Inc., 294 S.C. 470, 473, 366 S.E.2d 12, 14 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  To recover on a theory of restitution, the plaintiff must show: â€œ(1) he conferred a nongratuitous benefit on the defendant; (2) the defendant realized some value from the benefit; and (3) it would be inequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit without paying the plaintiff its value.â€Â  Moore-Hudson Oldsmobile/GMC, Inc. v. Waterman, 298 S.C. 107, 109, 378 S.E.2d 279, 280 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  â€œWhether restitution should be required is a question to be decided on the facts of each case.â€Â  Niggel Assocs., Inc. v. Poloâ€™s of N. Myrtle Beach, Inc., 296 S.C. 530, 532, 374 S.E.2d 507, 509 (Ct. App. 1988). \r\nThe master held that because Curry paid off the Note she has no equitable remedy against Manigault.Â  The master stated, â€œbefore [Curry] is entitled to claim restitution for unjust enrichment, she must prove that she acquired the right to payment from Defendant Manigault set forth in the Note.â€Â  This is an error of law.Â  The whole point of an unjust enrichment claim is to allow a plaintiff to recover for a benefit conferred to a defendant when that plaintiff lacked a contractual right against that defendant.Â  If Curry proved she â€œacquired the right to payment from Defendant Manigaultâ€â€”that is, if Curry established she had a contractual right to recover from Manigaultâ€”then she would not (and could not) resort to equity in the first instance.Â  See Van Robinson Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co., 272 S.C. 127, 128-29, 249 S.E.2d 744, 745 (1978) (holding that equity will not intervene if appellant has an adequate remedy at law).Â  Therefore, the master erred in concluding Curry could not seek equitable relief because she lacked a valid legal claim. \r\nMoreover, based on our view of the facts of this case, we are firmly persuaded Curry is entitled to restitution from Manigault.Â  First, there is no doubt Curry conferred a nongratuitous benefit to Manigault when she paid off Manigaultâ€™s portion of debt under the Note.Â  Second, because Manigault no longer owes Wachovia his portion of debt under the Note, Manigault realized value from Curryâ€™s payoff.Â  Third, it would be entirely inequitable to allow Manigault to retain this benefit without paying Curry for paying off his portion of the debt.Â  \r\nAlthough Manigault claims he had no idea Curry intended to pay off his portion of the debt under the Note and recover it later, the evidence suggests otherwise.Â  The record indicates Manigault was well aware of the October 2001 transaction between Curry and the Partnership.Â  Chard, the attorney who handled the closing, testified that he discussed the terms of the October 2001 closing with Manigault before the transaction occurred.Â  Ed Perkins, a listing agent on the Partnership property, testified that Manigault attended meetings between Curry, John, Robert, and Sanders â€œquite a bit.â€Â  Ernest, Curryâ€™s agent, testified that he, Manigault, John, and Robert held a meeting where Manigault personally choose the parcel he wanted on a plat of the Partnership property Curry intended to purchase.Â  Ernest also testified that Manigault was at the October 2001 closing.Â  The evidence clearly establishes that Manigault knew not only about Curryâ€™s plan to purchase Partnership property (other than his share), but also her intent to pay off the Note and Mortgage.\r\nIV.\r\nWe reverse and remand to the trial court to enter judgment against Manigault.Â  If required, the court shall conduct further proceedings to ascertain the precise amount due Curry.Â  The trial courtâ€™s order is \r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED.[2]\r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  More specifically, Curryâ€™s husband, Ernest, negotiated with Robert and John, but Ernest acted as Curryâ€™s agent throughout the transaction at issue in this case.\r\n[2]Â  In light of this disposition, we need not address Curryâ€™s remaining issues.Â  Whiteside v.

Few, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-378\r\nSubmitted October 1, 2006 â€“ Filed November 21, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nWilliam P. Walker, Jr., of Lexington, for Appellant.\r\nPope D. Johnson, III, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this personal injury action, Michael Ziegenfus (Ziegenfus) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment in favor of Fairfield Electric Cooperative, Inc. (Fairfield) on the basis of res judicata.Â  We affirm.[1]  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn July 2001, Fairfield contracted out the work of its substation high-voltage electrical testing to Branyon Electrical Maintenance, Inc. (Branyon). Â An explosion ensued while Ziegenfus, an employee of Branyon, was testing an energized piece of substation equipment owned by Fairfield.Â  As a result of the explosion, Ziegenfus was severely injured, suffering permanent scarring, disfigurement, and loss of function from third degree burns over forty-five percent of his body.\r\nOn August 1, 2001, Ziegenfus filed a Form 50 seeking workersâ€™ compensation benefits for his injuries as an employee of Branyon.Â  At the time of the injuries, Branyon was operating under the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act; its compensation carrier was Monumental General Casualty Company (Monumental).Â  On December 18, 2001, Ziegenfus filed an Amended Form 50 joining Fairfield and its compensation carrier, Federated Rural Electric Insurance Company (Federated), to the proceeding on the grounds that Branyon, a subcontractor of Fairfield, may have no insurance coverage for the claim.Â  \r\nOn June 18, 2002, the Single Commissioner of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission held a hearing to determine which employers and carriers were liable for compensation to Ziegenfus.Â  The Single Commissioner found that Branyon, and Monumental as its carrier, were liable for the injuries sustained by Ziegenfus.Â  The Single Commissioner further found that in the event Monumental appealed the order and it was determined that Monumental in fact had no coverage, Fairfield would then be liable to Ziegenfus as an â€œupstream employer.[2]â€Â  Accordingly, the Single Commissioner concluded that Fairfieldâ€™s carrier, Federated, would be liable for compensation to Ziegenfus.Â  The Appellate Panel affirmed the decision of the Single Commissioner.Â  The findings of fact and conclusions of law from the Single Commissionerâ€™s order were incorporated by reference into the decision of the Appellate Panel. \r\nOn March 1, 2004, Ziegenfus filed a civil action against Fairfield alleging strict liability and negligence for failing to de-energize the equipment which it owned and on which Ziegenfus was working on the date he sustained the electrical injuries.Â  On June 4, 2004, Fairfield moved for summary judgment on the ground that the Commissionâ€™s order had established, as res judicata, that Fairfield was a statutory employer of Ziegenfus and, therefore, his exclusive remedy was under the South Carolina Workerâ€™s Compensation Act.Â  \r\nOn April 21, 2005, the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of Fairfield, finding that under the doctrine of res judicata, because Ziegenfus was found to be a statutory employee of Fairfieldâ€™s in the workersâ€™ compensation proceeding, Ziegenfus could not relitigate the issue in a civil action.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the circuit courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment, the appellate court is instructed to apply the same standard that governs the circuit court under Rule 56(c) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure; summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  To determine whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences, which can reasonably be drawn therefrom, must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Faile v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Juvenile Justice, 350 S.C. 315, 324, 566 S.E.2d 536, 540 (2002).Â  â€œIf triable issues exist, those issues must go to the jury.â€Â  Young v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 333 S.C. 714, 717, 511 S.E.2d 413, 415 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nOn the other hand, â€œsummary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.â€Â  Vermeer Carolinaâ€™s, Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Corp., 336 S.C. 53, 59, 518 S.E.2d 301, 305 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  All ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed most strongly against the moving party.Â  Bayle v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 120, 542 S.E.2d 736, 738 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Summary judgment should be denied even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them.Â Â  Hall v. Fedor, 349 S.C. 169, 173-74, 561 S.E.2d 654, 656 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Summary judgment is a drastic remedy; it should therefore be cautiously invoked to prevent the improper deprivation of a trial of the disputed factual issues.Â Â  Lanham v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, 349 S.C. 356, 363, 563 S.E.2d 331, 334 (2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Application of the Doctrine of Res Judicata \r\nZiegenfus contends the circuit court erred in granting Fairfieldâ€™s motion\r\nfor summary judgment on the basis of res judicata.Â  Ziegenfus specifically contends the Commissionâ€™s findings regarding Fairfield were unnecessary and immaterial to the decision awarding workerâ€™s compensation benefits to Ziegenfus, and therefore res judicata did not apply.Â  Ziegenfus further contends that Fairfield was not a primary party, but rather an alternate party in the compensation hearing, and the liability of Fairfield was not a matter put in issue by Ziegenfus.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina has held that res judicata applies if the following elements are met: (1) the identities of the parties are the same as in the prior litigation; (2) the subject matter or cause of action is the same as in the prior litigation; and (3) there was a prior adjudication of the issue by a court of competent jurisdiction.Â  Johnson v. Greenwood Mills, Inc., 317 S.C. 248, 250-251, 452 S.E.2d 832, 833 (1994); Griggs v. Griggs, 214 S.C. 177, 51 S.E.2d 622, 627 (1949).Â  \r\n\r\nIn the application of the doctrine of res judicata, if it is doubtful whether a second action is for the same cause of action as the first, the test generally applied is to consider the identity of facts essential to their maintenance, or whether the same evidence would sustain both.Â  If the same facts or evidence would sustain both, the two actions are considered the same within the rule that the judgment in the former is a bar to the subsequent action.Â  Moreover, before the doctrine of res judicata is applied in such cases, it should appear that the precise question involved in the subsequent action was determined in the former action.\r\n\r\nGriggs, 214 S.C. at 177, 51 S.E.2d at 626.Â  \r\nAs to the first element of res judicata, Ziegenfus filed an Amended Form 50, naming Fairfield as a party in the workerâ€™s compensation proceeding.Â  Likewise, the record shows that Ziegenfus also named Fairfield as a party defendant in the civil action.Â  Ziegenfus remained the claimant/plaintiff party in both actions.Â  Since the identities of the parties were the same in the prior compensation proceeding as in the instant civil action, the first element of res judicata has been adequately met.\r\nAs to the second element of res judicata, Ziegenfus directly presented to the Commission the determination of whether Fairfield had any liability in the matter.Â  Further, Ziegenfus filed an Amended Form 50, specifically joining Fairfield as a party to the compensation proceeding.Â  Therefore, despite Ziegenfusâ€™ contention otherwise, he put the issue of Fairfieldâ€™s liability in the matter by seeking the Commissionâ€™s determination of Fairfieldâ€™s liability based on its status as his statutory employer.Â  Likewise, in the instant civil action, Ziegenfus alleged Fairfieldâ€™s liability for the injuries he sustained as a statutory employee of Fairfield, while testing equipment owned by Fairfield.Â  Therefore, as required by Griggs, the subject matter is the same in both actions.\r\nMoreover, under the Griggs test, the Commission found that Fairfield contracted with Branyon to perform work integral to the operation of its business, and Ziegenfus, as an employee of Branyon, was injured during the work.Â  Likewise, in the civil action, Ziegenfus asserted Fairfield â€œsecured Branyon, an independent contractor together with its employees,â€ including Ziegenfus, to perform high-voltage testing of its substation.Â  Here, evidence in both the workersâ€™ compensation proceeding and the instant action show that Fairfield was a statutory employer of Ziegenfus.Â  Under the Griggs test, because the same facts or evidence are relevant to the determination of the claims raised in each action, the two actions are considered the same for res judicata purposes. \r\nAs to the final element of res judicata, the Commission found Fairfield would be liable to Ziegenfus as an upstream employer in the event Monumental had no coverage.Â  This finding was not immaterial because Ziegenfus sought that determination in his Amended Form 50.Â  \r\nBased on the above, we find all three elements of res judicata were met in this matter.Â  The circuit court, therefore, did not err in applying the doctrine of res judicata based on the Commissionâ€™s adjudication that Fairfield was a statutory employer of Ziegenfus.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we find Ziegenfus failed to present facts sufficient to raise a genuine issue of any material fact as to whether the doctrine of res judicata applied in this matter. The decision of the circuit court is accordingly\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF, SHORT, JJ. and CURETON, AJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The Single Commissionerâ€™s reference to Fairfield as an â€œupstream employerâ€ of Ziegenfusâ€™ is synonymous to Fairfieldâ€™s status as a â€œstatutory employerâ€ of Ziegenfusâ€™.

(Any Lengths) in an action where Respondent Wanda Phillips (Phillips) alleged premises liability and negligence against Any Lengths.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Phillips based on Any Lengthsâ€™ failure to respond to Phillipsâ€™ request for admissions.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn August of 2000, Phillips was a resident at Any Lengths Recovery, Inc., a rehabilitation treatment facility.Â  On August 13, 2000,Â  while playing a game of volleyball at the facility, Phillips was suddenly knocked to the ground by two dogs.[2]Â  As a result, she suffered injuries requiring reconstructive surgery on her knee. She continues on pain medications for symptoms resulting from the injuries.Â  Phillips alleged the common area where her injuries were sustained were under the control of Any Lengths.Â  \r\nOn July 7, 2004, Phillips sued Any Lengths alleging both premises liability and negligence.Â  In its Answer, Any Lengths denied liability for Phillipsâ€™ injuries.Â  On January 28, 2004, Phillips sent her first interrogatories and request to produce to Any Lengths.Â  On March 4, 2004, Phillips sent Any Lengths a letter asking for a response to her discovery requests.Â  Five months later, Phillips still had not received any response from Any Lengths.Â  Phillips, then, sent a second letter to Any Lengths in August of 2004 requesting Any Lengths to respond to her discovery requests, and threatening to file a motion to compel. Â Â Because Any Lengthsâ€™ failed to respond, Phillips filed a motion to compel on August 18, 2004.Â  Notice of the hearing on the motion to compel was given to all parties.Â  In the meantime, Phillips served Any Lengths with a second interrogatory and request for production on September 1, 2004, and a third interrogatory and request for production on September 22, 2004, to which Any Lengths also did not respond.Â  \r\nOn January 4, 2005, the trial court heard Phillipsâ€™ motion to compel and noted that Any Lengths failed to appear at the hearing.Â  The trial court granted Phillipsâ€™ motion to compel and ordered Any Lengths to â€œcomply with all outstanding discovery requested by Plaintiff without any objections whatsoever within ten days after entry of this order.â€Â  The trial court further ordered that failure to comply with the order would result in â€œall appropriate remedies and sanctions available.â€Â  A cover letter from the Clerk of Court states that on February 4, 2005, the trial courtâ€™s order to compel was mailed to counsel for Any Lengths.Â  Nevertheless, on January 10, 2005, Phillips served a second copy of the trial courtâ€™s ruling on Any Lengths by way of facsimile and regular mail.Â  Any Lengths did not respond to the discovery order within ten days as ordered.Â  \r\nOn January 27, 2005, Phillips mailed a request for admissions to Any Lengthsâ€™ counsel.Â  Any Lengths, however, did not respond to Phillipsâ€™ request with either written responses or objection to the request.Â  Counsel for Any Lengths claimed he did not receive the request.Â  However, the Record on Appeal shows a certificate of service was attached to the copy of the request for admissions mailed to Any Lengths.Â  On March 7, 2005, Phillips moved for summary judgment based upon Any Lengthsâ€™ failure to respond to discovery, including its failure to comply with the courtâ€™s order, and a failure to respond to the request for admissions.Â  Any Lengths was served with notice of the motion for summary judgment on the same date.Â  On April 4, 2005, the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment as to liability against Any Lengths for failure to respond to the request for admissions, which under Rule 36 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, was deemed admitted.Â  \r\nOn April 5, 2005, Any Lengths moved for reconsideration of the summary judgment order, which the court subsequently denied.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56(c) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure; summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  In determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences, which can reasonably be drawn therefrom, must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Faile v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Juvenile Justice, 350 S.C. 315, 324, 566 S.E.2d 536, 540 (2002).Â  â€œIf triable issues exist, those issues must go to the jury.â€Â  Young v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 333 S.C. 714, 717, 511 S.E.2d 413, 415 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œSummary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.â€Â  Vermeer Carolinaâ€™s Inc. v. Wool/Chuck Chipper Corp., 336 S.C. 53, 59, 518 S.E.2d 301, 305 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nÂ As a primary matter, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment against Any Lengths based on Rule 220(c) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  Rule 220(c), SCRCP states: â€œThe appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.â€ The Record on Appeal indicates counsel for Any Lengths has repeatedly failed to respond to Phillipsâ€™ discovery requests since the commencement of this litigation, which had been nearly two years on the date of the hearing on the motion for summary judgment on April 4, 2005. \r\nAny Lengths failed to respond to four sets of interrogatories and requests to produce.Â  Any Lengths also failed to respond to Phillipsâ€™ request for admissions or appear at the hearing on motion to compel.Â  Any Lengths even failed to respond to a court order compelling its response to outstanding discovery within ten days of entry of the order.Â  These omissions occurred despite Any Lengthsâ€™ admission to receipt of such documents as: (1) two letters from Phillips requesting production; (2) notice of Phillipsâ€™ motion to compel; (3) a copy of the courtâ€™s order regarding the motion to compel; (4) Phillipsâ€™ fourth request for production; and (5) notice of Phillipsâ€™ motion for summary judgment.Â  Under these circumstances, and in view of the history of Any Lengthsâ€™ failure to respond to discovery even to the point of disregarding a court order, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment.\r\nI.&nbsp; Non-receipt of Request for Admissions\r\nAs to Any Lengthsâ€™ contention that the trial court erred in deeming Phillipsâ€™ request to admit admitted in the face of Any Lengthsâ€™ claim it did not receive notice of the request until it received Phillipsâ€™ summary judgment motion, we find no error. \r\nSouth Carolina Rule of Civil Procedure 5(b)(1) provides that â€œservice upon the attorney or upon a party shall be made by delivering a copy to the attorney or party or by mailing it to him at his last known address or, if no address is known, by leaving it with the clerk of court.â€Â  Service by mail is therefore complete upon mailing of all pleadings following service of the original summons and complaint.Â  Rule 5(b)(1), SCRCP.Â  \r\nHere, the Record on Appeal indicates Phillips met the burden of showing that notice was actually mailed by presenting a valid certificate of service dated January 27, 2005.Â  Therefore, the record supports the trial courtâ€™s acceptance of Phillipsâ€™ certification that the request for admissions had been mailed, in spite of Any Lengthsâ€™ claim[3] of non-receipt of the request. \r\nFurther, under Rule 36(a) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, â€œall matters contained in a request for admissions are admitted unless, within 30 days after service of the request, or within such shorter or longer time as the court may allow, the party serves answers or objects to the matter.â€Â  Hinson-Barr, Inc. v. Pinckard, 292 S.C. 267, 269-70, 356 S.E.2d 115, 116 (1987). â€œFailure to respond to a request for admissions deems the request admitted.â€Â  Rule 36(a), SCRCP; Hatchell v. Jackson, 290 S.C. 256, 258, 349 S.E.2d 407, 408 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  Â \r\nII.&nbsp; Time to Respond Not Yet Expired \r\nWe also reject Any Lengths contention the trial court erred in deeming Phillipsâ€™ request for admissions admitted and granting summary judgment against Any Lengths because Phillipsâ€™ notice of summary judgment motion constituted subsequent service of the request for admissions.Â  Thus, the time to respond to the request had not expired when the court deemed the request admitted.Â  In view of our holding that there was no error on the part of the trial court in accepting Phillipsâ€™ certification of service of the request for admissions, we hold this argument to be manifestly without merit and dispose of it pursuant to Rule 220(c), SCRCP.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Bright-Line Test\r\nFinally, as to Any Lengthsâ€™ contention the trial court erred in deeming Phillipsâ€™ request for admissions admitted and the application of a bright line test, we find no error.\r\nRelying on Collins v. White, 363 S.C. 546, 611 S.E.2d 262 (Ct. App. 2005), Any Lengths argues that instead of applying a bright line test, the trial court should have exercised its discretion and refused to deem the request admitted when the admissions arose solely from the failure to make a timely response.Â  However, Any Lengthsâ€™ reliance on Collins is misplaced and demonstrates a misunderstanding of the procedural facts upon which the court in Collins determined judicial discretion was appropriate in refusing to deem the request admitted.Â  \r\nIn Collins, the court refused to deem the unanswered request admitted because not only did the party to whom the response was requested fail to respond in a timely manner, but the requesting party knowingly sent the requests to the wrong address with the understanding that no attorney was present or practiced at that address. 363 S.C. at 553, 611 S.E.2d at 265.Â  The record does not indicate that such a deceptive act occurred in the present case.Â  Further, in Collins, the court permitted the party to whom the response was requested to file a late response to the request pursuant to the partyâ€™s motion to file a late answer to the request. Id.Â  In the present case,Â  Any Lengths did not request additional time to respond to the request, not even between the date Any Lengths claimed to have learned of the request by way of the notice of motion for summary judgment on March 7, 2005, and the time of the hearing on the motion for reconsideration on April 6, 2005.Â  \r\nUnder Rule 36(b) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, any matter admitted under Rule 36(a) is â€œconclusively established unless the court on motion permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission.â€ Scott v. Greenville Housing Auth., 353 S.C. 639, 645, 579 S.E.2d 151, 154 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Once a party moves for withdrawal or amendment of the admission, the court applies a test to determine: (1) whether the presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved by the withdrawal or amendment; and (2) whether the party who obtained the admission can prove to the court that the withdrawal or amendment will prejudice him in maintaining his action or defense on the merits.Â  Rule 36(b), SCRCP; Â Baughman v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 109-110, 410 S.E.2d 537, 542 (1991). However, if the party seeking to amend or withdraw the admission does not move for withdrawal or amendment, the court will not need to apply the test for withdrawal or amendment and will deem the request admitted.Â  Hinson-Barr, Inc. v. Pinckard, 292 S.C. 267, 270, 356 S.E.2d 115, 117 (1987) (finding that because buyer made no motion to withdraw or amend his admissions, they were deemed admitted).\r\nAny Lengths claims it requested permission at the summary judgment hearing to respond to discovery. However, as we read the record, Any Lengthsâ€™ counselâ€™s request at the summary judgment hearing concerned the motion to produce, not the request for admissions.Â  \r\nWe find the trial court appropriately applied the bright line test given the lack of Any Lengthsâ€™ attempts to move to file a late response to the request for admissions.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court did not err in deeming Phillipsâ€™ request for admissions admitted and granting summary judgment against Any Lengths based upon its application of the bright line test.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nÂ For the foregoing reasons, the trial court properly deemed the\r\nrequest for admissions admitted and granted summary judgment against Any Lengths on the grounds of Any Lengthsâ€™ failure to respond to the request under Rule 36 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure and its failure to respond to discovery in general.Â  Â Â Â Â Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment to Phillips is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, SHORT, JJ., and CURETON, AJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The two dogs were owned by Defendants Martin Bayless and Bryson Folks, both of whom are not parties to this appeal.Â  \r\n[3] Any Lengthsâ€™ attorneyâ€™s claim of non-receipt is based on the fact that the request for admissions could not be found in his file. The fact that the request could not be found in the file is not proof that it was not received by his office. The mailing of the request, along with a valid certificate of service, gave rise to a rebuttable presumption of receipt.Â  Weir v. Citicorp Natâ€™l Serv., Inc., 312 S.C. 511, 513, 435 S.E.2d 864, 868 (1993) (finding a rebuttable presumption regarding receipt is established upon the evidence of mailing a properly addressed document).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-380","title":"Brinkley v.

Powell, Jr., of Columbia, for Appellant.Â  \r\n        Francis T. Draine, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Mark A. and Karyn M. Brinkley filed this negligence and legal malpractice action arising from a real estate transaction against Gregory K. Martin, ASL, Inc., a/k/a All Saints Landing, a Corporation, Wayne Hucks, Danny T. and Deborah Carroll, and Ron Teague.Â The circuit court granted the Brinkleysâ€™ motion to transfer the case to the jury docket.Â  Gregory Martin appeals.Â  We reverse.[1] \r\nFACTS\r\nWith the commencement of this action, the Brinkleys demanded a jury trial.Â  The circuit court referred the matter to the master in equity with finality by order filed September 24, 2001.Â  No appeal was taken from this order.Â  Shortly thereafter, the master ruled on one issue in the case.Â  Other issues remained undecided.Â  Approximately two and a half years later, the Brinkleys moved to transfer the case to the active jury trial roster on the sole ground the reference to the master was a mistake.Â  After ruling on another pending issue in the case, the master wrote the chief administrative judge requesting recusal for the remainder of the case. Â Judge Paula Thomas responded on March 24, 2004, recusing the master and informing the parties they must agree on a special referee within five days â€œor the case will be put on the Court roster.â€ Â \r\nJudge Cottingham denied the Brinkleysâ€™ motion to transfer the matter to the jury roster by order dated May 3, 2004, finding the order of reference affected the mode of trial and should have been immediately appealed.[2]Â  Judge Cottingham also found the motion, based on the ground of â€œmistake,â€ was not made within the one year limitation of Rule 60(b), SCRCP. Â The Brinkleys did not appeal this order.Â  \r\nIn February of 2005, the Brinkleys moved for change of venue from Horry County to Florence County, and complained about the delay in the case being set for trial on the Horry County jury roster.Â  By order filed September 12, 2005, Judge Thomas concluded the â€œeffect of [the masterâ€™s] recusal was that jurisdiction of the case should be referredâ€ to the special referee.Â  Judge Thomas accordingly referred the action to the special referee to enter final judgment.Â  On September 13, 2005, the Brinkleys forwarded a chronology of events and supporting documentation to Judge Thomas.Â  In response, Judge Thomas declared the September 24, 2001 order of reference to the master â€œnull and voidâ€ and transferred the case to the jury docket.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n Martin argues Judge Thomas erred in voiding the September 24, 2001 order of reference and effectively reversing Judge Cottinghamâ€™s May 3, 2004 order denying the Brinkleysâ€™ motion to transfer the case to the jury roster.Â  We agree.\r\nIn their motion to transfer the case to the jury roster, the Brinkleys relied on â€œmistakeâ€ as the ground for setting aside the original order of reference.Â  A motion to set aside an order on the ground of mistake is governed by Rule 60(b)(1) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  Rule 60(b) provides:\r\n    \r\n      On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:\r\n       (1) Â mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;\r\n      * * *\r\n      The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after the judgment, order or proceeding was entered or taken.\r\n    \r\nRule 60(b), SCRCP. Â The one year limit for motions pursuant to Rule 60(b)(1)-(3) is an absolute time limit.Â  Coleman v. Dunlap, 306 S.C. 491, 495, 413 S.E.2d 15, 17 (1992).Â  The Brinkleysâ€™ motion to transfer the case to the jury roster is dated March 5, 2004, more than two years after the filing of the September 24, 2001 order of reference.Â  We find Judge Cottingham correctly concluded the motion to transfer the case to the jury calendar, based on a mistake in the order of reference, was not timely filed pursuant to Rule 60(b)(1).Â  \r\n    Furthermore, the Brinkleysâ€™ failure to appeal either the order of reference or Judge Cottinghamâ€™s order finally determines the mode of trial issue.Â  A party waives its right to a jury trial by failing to immediately appeal an order denying a motion for a jury trial.Â  Lester v. Dawson, 327 S.C. 263, 265, 491 S.E.2d 240, 241 (1997).Â  See also Edwards v. Timmons, 297 S.C. 314, 316, 377 S.E.2d 97, 97 (1988) (holding that the trial courtâ€™s unappealed order of reference to a master in equity became the law of the case); Creed v. Stokes, 285 S.C. 542, 542-43, 331 S.E.2d 351, 352 (1985) (finding the appellant waived his objection to the order of reference by not immediately appealing the order).\r\n    Because the order of reference was not appealed and Judge Cottinghamâ€™s order appropriately applied Rule 60(b)(1) and was likewise not appealed, the mode of trial issue was finally determined prior to the Brinkleysâ€™ submission of a chronology and documentation to Judge Thomas.Â  Accordingly, the order voiding the order of reference and effectively reversing the order denying the Brinkleysâ€™ motion to transfer the case to the jury roster is reversed.Â  See also Medlock v. Love Shop, Ltd., 286 S.C. 486, 487, 334 S.E.2d 528, 529 (Ct. App. 1985) (holding that one circuit judge does not have the power to review, modify, affirm, or reverse findings of another circuit court judge).\r\n    REVERSED.\r\n    GOOLSBY, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â This court may not consider any alleged error in the trial courtâ€™s failure to continue the matter as the Brinkleys did not appeal the issue.Â  See Town of Mt.

(Mother) and Arnold H. (Father) to their six minor children.Â  The family court found Mother and Fatherâ€™s parental rights should be terminated for three reasons: 1) Mother and Father have harmed their children through abuse or neglect, 2) Mother and Father have diagnosable mental disabilities making it unlikely they can or will be in the future able to care for the six children, and 3) the six children have been in foster care for fifteen of the last twenty-two months.Â  Additionally, the family court found that termination of parental rights was in the childrenâ€™s best interest.

Hightower, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\n        Thomas P. Stoney, II, of Moncks Corner, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Valerie Vanessa Mathis B.[1] (Mother) appeals the family courtâ€™s order terminating her parental rights to her two minor children.Â  We affirm.[2]\r\nFACTS/PROCEDUREAL HISTORY\r\nMother is the parent of three children, each of whom has a different father.Â  Her oldest child is emancipated and not part of this termination of parental rights (TPR) action. Â Mother gave birth to Hector Manuel L., Jr. (Hector) on February 27, 1991.Â  Hectorâ€™s father is deceased and not part of this TPR action.Â  Motherâ€™s youngest child is Veronica Lee B. (Veronica), who was born on February 1, 1995, to Ronald B. (Father).Â  \r\nDSS took the children into emergency protective custody on January 10, 2002, on allegations of educational neglect and threat of harm of physical neglect.[3]Â  At the time, Mother was living in a hotel purportedly after leaving the family residence due to domestic violence, and the children did not attend school. Â On the night before the children were removed, Mother had used crack cocaine in bed with her paramour while the children slept just a few feet away on a couch.Â  \r\nOn February 11, 2002, Mother consented to begin a treatment plan.Â  Among other things, the treatment plan required that within six months she: Â financially support the children; provide a safe and nurturing home free from abuse and neglect; sign specific releases; submit to random drug screenings; and engage in recommended drug counseling, alcohol counseling, and family therapy.Â  Mother ultimately was discharged from four substance abuse programs for failing to attend scheduled appointments or testing positive for cocaine or crack cocaine. \r\nDSS ultimately initiated the present action on October 1, 2003.Â  A final hearing was originally scheduled for January 24, 2005, but was continued so Mother could have a final opportunity to demonstrate compliance with the treatment plan.Â  Based on what essentially amounted to the partiesâ€™ reiteration of Motherâ€™s previous treatment plan, in February 2005 Mother agreed to: Â obtain proper housing by March 1, 2005; sign releases for her treatment providers; submit to hair follicle testing by February 14, 2005; undergo random urine testing for drugs; obtain written updates from her treatment providers; provide proof she receives a steady income; and clear outstanding warrants for her arrest by March 1, 2005.Â  Mother admittedly failed to achieve any of these tasks except for clearing her outstanding arrest warrants. \r\nIn an attempt to resolve her outstanding arrest warrants, Mother was incarcerated on February 15, 2005, for charges of breach of trust, forgery, passing fraudulent checks to her employer, and probation violation.Â  Her anticipated release date was July 1, 2005.Â  \r\nThe merits hearing that began in January 2005 resumed on June 6, 2005.Â  The family court issued a written order on July 12, 2005, in which it found Mother had failed to demonstrate compliance with her treatment plan, among other things.Â  The court terminated Motherâ€™s parental rights to her minor children pursuant to the following statutory grounds:Â  (1) failing to remedy the conditions that led to the childrenâ€™s removal; (2) willfully failing to support her minor children; and (3) because her minor children had been in foster care for fifteen of the preceding twenty-two months.Â  After finding statutory grounds for termination, the family court also determined that TPR was in the childrenâ€™s best interests.[4] Â This appeal followed.\r\nSCOPE OF REVIEW\r\nUnder South Carolinaâ€™s TPR statute, â€œ[t]he family court may order the termination of parental rights upon a finding of one or more of the [listed] grounds and a finding that termination is in the best interest of the child.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2005).Â  Grounds for TPR must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.&nbsp; Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 296, 513 S.E.2d 358, 366 (1999).Â  On appeal, this court may review the record and make its own determination whether the grounds for termination are supported by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 293, 547 S.E.2d 506, 509 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Despite this broad scope of review, however, we should not necessarily disregard the findings of the family court because the family court is in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and assign weight to their testimony.Â  Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nMother does not dispute that her minor children were in foster care for at least fifteen of the twenty-two months preceding the TPR hearing.[5]Â  Instead, she contends the family court erred in terminating her parental rights solely on the statutory basis that the children had been in foster care under DSS custody for at least fifteen of the previous months.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(8) (Supp. 2005) (providing a ground for termination where a child has been in DSS custody for fifteen of the preceding twenty-two months).Â  Specifically, Mother claims such a termination â€œdoes not comport with due process or fundamental fairness under federal constitution.â€ Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe record, however, contains no indication that this issue was ever raised to or ruled upon by the family court.Â  Thus, the issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  See Charleston County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Jackson, 368 S.C. 87, 104-05, 627 S.E.2d 765, 775 (Ct. App. 2006) (finding Fatherâ€™s claim that termination of parental rights violated his right to due process was not preserved for appellate review since this issue was not raised to or ruled upon by the trial court); Grant v. S.C. Coastal Council, 319 S.C. 348, 356, 461 S.E.2d 388, 392 (1995) (holding a constitutional due process claim raised for first time on appeal was not preserved); In re Care &amp; Treatment of Corley, 365 S.C. 252, 258, 616 S.E.2d 441, 444 (Ct. App. 2005) (â€œConstitutional issues, like most others, must be raised to and ruled on by the trial court to be preserved for appeal.â€). Â Â \r\nBecause we find at least one statutory ground for TPR has been met, the only issue remaining for us to consider is whether termination is in the childrenâ€™s best interests. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2005) (providing family court may terminate parental rights if it finds at least one of the statutory grounds for termination has been met and that termination is in the best interests of the child); S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Sims, 359 S.C. 601, 608, 598 S.E.2d 303, 307 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œA finding pursuant to section 20-7-1572(8) alone is sufficient to support a termination of parental rights.â€); see also Charleston County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. King, 369 S.C. 96, ____, 631 S.E.2d 239, 241 (2006) (declining to address merits of arguments against additional TPR grounds where at least one TPR ground is undisputedly proven).[6] Â \r\nBased on our review of the record, we find there is clear and convincing evidence that the termination of Motherâ€™s parental rights was in the best interests of the children.Â  Testimony from the childrenâ€™s guardian ad litem indicates their best interests were served by terminating Motherâ€™s parental rights.Â  She testified she had been the childrenâ€™s guardian for over three years and during that time Mother had been difficult to communicate with and was uncooperative and difficult.Â  She said the children were doing much better, and were living in a loving, stable, and secure home.Â  In particular, she noted that Veronica had initially been belligerent and would â€œact out,â€ but had since made a â€œ100 percent turnaround.â€ Â The guardian ad litem expressly testified that terminating Motherâ€™s parental rights was in the childrenâ€™s best interests.Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing, the TPR order of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â In order to protect the identities of the parties, we refer to them only by their first names and the last initial.\r\n[2] Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3] DSS had previously been involved with the family in 1998.Â  At that time, Mother fled to Florida to avoid having the children taken into emergency protective custody.Â  Mother eventually fled the State of Florida and returned to South Carolina after Florida authorities sought to take the children into protective custody following reports that Mother had left the children at home unsupervised for an entire day.Â  \r\n[4]Â Section 20-7-1572(2), (4), and (8) of the South Carolina Code provides the family court may order the termination of parental rights upon a finding of one or more of the following grounds and a finding that termination is in the best interest of the child:\r\n(2) The child has been removed from the parent pursuant to Section 20-7-610 or Section 20-7-736, has been out of the home for a period of six months following the adoption of a placement plan by court order or by agreement between the department and the parent, and the parent has not remedied the conditions which caused the removal;\r\n. . .\r\n(4) The child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period of six months, and during that time the parent has willfully failed to support the child. Â Failure to support means that the parent has failed to make a material contribution to the childâ€™s care. Â A material contribution consists of either financial contributions according to the parentâ€™s means or contributions of food, clothing, shelter, or other necessities for the care of the child according to the parentâ€™s means. Â The court may consider all relevant circumstances in determining whether or not the parent has willfully failed to support the child, including requests for support by the custodian and the ability of the parent to provide support;\r\n. . . \r\n8) The child has been in foster care under the responsibility of the State for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2005).\r\n[5]Â  At the time of the hearing in June 2005, the children had been in foster care for approximately forty months or three and one-half years.Â  \r\n[6]Â  In light of our affirmance on this ground, we find it unnecessary to address Motherâ€™s remaining issues in which she challenges the family courtâ€™s findings regarding the following statutory grounds for termination:Â  (1)Â  she willfully failed to comply with the February 2005 treatment plan; (2) there was clear and convincing evidence that she willfully refused to remedy the conditions that caused the removal of her children; and (3) she willfully failed to make material contributions for the care of her children while in the custody of DSS. Â See Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Phillips, 365 S.C. 572, 577, 618 S.E.2d 922, 924 (Ct. App. 2005) (declining to address in TPR action family courtâ€™s additional finding concerning Motherâ€™s failure to support child where appellate court affirmed finding that Mother failed to adequately remedy the conditions which caused the childâ€™s removal).\r\n Additionally, Mother argues the family court improperly shifted to her the burden â€œto present clear and convincing evidence to disprove the charges lodged by DSS.â€Â Â  To support her argument, Mother only makes reference to statements by DSS and the childrenâ€™s guardian ad litem indicating Mother failed to demonstrate compliance with her treatment plan.Â  However, Mother admitted at trial that the burden was on her to demonstrate she completed her treatment plan. Â Because Mother conceded this issue at trial, she may not raise it on appeal.Â  See Condor, Inc. v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, 328 S.C. 173, 178, 493 S.E.2d 342, 344 (1997) (holding an issue conceded in trial court cannot be argued on appeal). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-383","title":"Murray v.

Earl Ellis, Jr., of Columbia; for Appellant.\r\n        Ernest Caskey Trammell, of Anderson; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this workerâ€™s compensation case, Avondale Mills, Inc. (Employer), appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order affirming the decision of the Appellate Panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (Full Commission) awarding benefits to Timothy Murray for ruptured cervical discs.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn April 20, 2003, Murray, a twenty-three-year employee of Avondale Mills, sustained an injury to his neck while working as a slotter in the textile mill.Â  As a slotter, Murray monitored three frame machines through which cotton and polyester are fed.Â  This job required Murray to bend, stoop, squat, climb, push, pull, reach, twist and turn in order to keep the machines operational.Â  As part of this process, Murray was often required to â€œfix an endâ€ by walking around the frame, stepping up on it, bending over and then putting the end up.Â  On the day of the injury, Murray was fixing the end on frame number eight when he noticed that frame number nine was getting ready to stop.Â  Murray then moved from frame number eight to frame number nine.Â  As Murray stood up, turned and twisted to his right while going down the two steps to tend to frame number nine, he felt pain in his neck and right arm.\r\nMurray immediately reported the injury to his supervisor.Â  He then completed the remaining three hours of his shift.Â  Because the pain in his neck and right arm persisted, Murray sought treatment two days later from his family doctor.Â  Shortly thereafter, an MRI revealed that Murray had herniated C5-6 and C6-7 discs.Â  After physical therapy did not alleviate Murrayâ€™s pain, Dr. Oetting, a neurosurgeon, performed surgery on Murray for an â€œanterior cervical diskectomy and fusion with allograft and Atlantis plate.â€Â  Approximately three and a half months post-surgery, Dr. Oetting completed an affidavit in which he acknowledged that Murrayâ€™s â€œhistory of being injured at work was consistent with [his] findings of two disc ruptures at C5-6 centrally, and C6-7 to the right.â€Â  Dr. Oetting further noted that Murray had not reached maximum medical improvement as of the date of the affidavit. Â Â Â \r\nMurray filed a Form 50 to receive workerâ€™s compensation benefits for his injury. Â Employer denied the claim and disputed whether the injury occurred at work. Â After a hearing, the single commissioner found Murray suffered a compensable injury to his neck and right arm on April 20, 2003.Â  In reaching this decision, the commissioner specifically found Murrayâ€™s testimony to be credible. Â Based on these findings, the commissioner ordered Employer to pay Murray medical expenses as well as temporary total disability benefits beginning on April 24, 2003, the day Murray stopped working, until further order of the Commission.Â  \r\nThe Full Commission unanimously affirmed the order of the single commissioner.Â  On appeal, the circuit court affirmed the decision of the Full Commission.Â  In its order, the circuit court noted that Employer â€œessentially admits that Mr. Murray injured his neck at work; however, the employer contends Mr. Murrayâ€™s neck injury was idiopathic and, therefore, did not arise out of his work.â€Â  The court rejected this contention and found that â€œ[w]hen â€˜considering all the circumstancesâ€™ relating to Mr. Murrayâ€™s neck injury, there is certainly substantial evidence of a causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the resulting injury.â€Â  The court further stated â€œthere is substantial evidence that Mr. Murray was performing a physically demanding job requiring him to work hurriedly between machines, bend, go up and down steps and the injury occurred when he twisted his neck to move quickly between machines to keep them operational, which was a requirement of his job.â€Â  \r\nEmployer appeals the decision of the circuit court.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission. Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981). â€œIn workersâ€™ compensation cases, the Full Commission is the ultimate fact finder.â€ Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  The Full Commission is specifically reserved the task of assessing the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be accorded evidence. Id. \r\nâ€œAccordingly, this Court will not substitute its judgment for that of the commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.â€ Therrell v. Jerryâ€™s Inc., 370 S.C. 22, ___, 633 S.E.2d 893, 894 (2006). Â â€œ[T]his Court may reverse or modify the commissionâ€™s decision if Petitioner has suffered the appropriate degree of prejudice and the commissionâ€™s decision is effected by an error of law or is â€˜clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.â€™â€ Id. at ___, 633 S.E.2d at 895 (quoting S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(2005)).Â  â€œIt is not within our province to reverse findings of the Commission which are supported by substantial evidence.â€ Broughton v. South of the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 496, 520 S.E.2d 634, 637 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nEmployer argues the circuit court erred in finding that Murrayâ€™s injury arose out of his employment.Â  Employer contends Murray failed to prove there was a causal connection between his work activities and the cervical disc ruptures. Â We disagree.\r\nIn order to receive workersâ€™ compensation benefits, Murray must prove that he sustained an â€œinjury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2005).Â  â€œThe term â€˜arose out ofâ€™ refers to the origin of the cause of the accident, while the term â€˜in the course ofâ€™ refers to the time, place, and circumstances under which the accident occurred.â€ Howell v. Pac. Columbia Mills, 291 S.C. 469, 471, 354 S.E.2d 384, 385 (1987).Â  â€œAlthough the requirements are somewhat overlapping, they are not synonymous and both must exist simultaneously to allow the claimant to recover.â€ Gibson v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. #3, 338 S.C. 510, 518, 526 S.E.2d 725, 729 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nâ€œThe injury arises out of employment when there is a causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the resulting injury.â€ Broughton v. South of the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 497, 520 S.E.2d 634, 638 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œAn injury occurs â€˜in the course ofâ€™ employment within the meaning of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act when it occurs within the period of employment at a place where the employee reasonably may be in the performance of his duties and while fulfilling those duties or engaged in something incidental thereto.â€Â  Id. at 498, 520 S.E.2d at 639.Â  \r\nâ€œWhether there is any causal connection between employment and an injury is a question of fact for the Commission.â€Â  Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 159, 519 S.E.2d 102, 105 (1999).Â  â€œBecause causation is a question of fact, the full commissionâ€™s decision on the issue must be affirmed if it is supported by substantial evidence in the record.â€ Shuler v. Gregory Elec., 366 S.C. 435, 440, 622 S.E.2d 569, 571 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nTherefore, we must affirm the Commissionâ€™s ruling unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  Nettles v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. #7, 341 S.C. 580, 586, 535 S.E.2d 146, 149 (Ct. App. 2000).Â Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is â€˜not a mere scintilla of evidence nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached or must have reached in order to justify its action.â€™â€Â  Miller by Miller v. State Roofing Co., 312 S.C. 452, 454, 441 S.E.2d 323, 324-25 (1994) (quoting Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981)).Â  â€œThe substantial evidence rule does not allow judicial fact-finding, or the substitution of judicial judgment for agency judgment.Â  A judgment upon which reasonable men might differ will not be set aside.â€Â  Toddâ€™s Ice Cream, Inc. v. South Carolina Employment Sec. Commâ€™n, 281 S.C. 254, 258, 315 S.E.2d 373, 375 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  However, â€œ[w]here there is a conflict in the evidence, either of different witnesses or of the same witnesses, the findings of fact of the Commission as triers of the fact are conclusive.â€Â  Holcombe v. Dan River Mills/Woodside Div., 286 S.C. 223, 225, 333 S.E.2d 338, 340 (Ct. App. 1985).\r\nOur review of the record indicates there was substantial evidence to support the Commissionâ€™s finding that Murrayâ€™s injury arose out of his employment.[2]Â  Murrayâ€™s employment as a slotter required him to walk, bend, stoop, squat, climb, push, pull, reach, twist and turn to keep operational the three machines for which he was responsible. Â Based on these work-related actions, Murray acknowledged that his job was â€œrather physical.â€ Â He further stated that he had to move between the machines in a â€œhurry fashion.â€Â  At the time of the injury, Murray was in the process of performing these tasks.Â  Murray testified his job required him to work at a â€œsteady paceâ€ and walk in a â€œhurryâ€ to keep the frames running.Â  At the time of the injury, Murray testified he was fixing an end on machine number eight when he noticed a problem with machine number nine.Â  He stated that he hurt his neck and his arm when he stepped down and then twisted and turned to work on machine number nine. \r\nSignificantly, Murray further testified that he had no physical problems prior to the accident and had already worked approximately nine hours of his twelve-hour shift. Â Murray also testified, and supported with documentation, that he had an excellent, twenty-three-year work history which included several years of perfect attendance. Â Finally, Dr. Oetting, Murrayâ€™s treating neurosurgeon, stated in an affidavit that â€œMr. Murrayâ€™s history of being injured at work was consistent with [his] findings of two disc ruptures at C5-6 centrally, and C6-7 to the right.â€ Â Thus, there is substantial evidence that Murrayâ€™s injury was related to the performance of his employment duties.\r\nAdditionally, we reject Employerâ€™s contention that Murrayâ€™s injury was not compensable because it was similar to cases where our appellate courts declined to compensate an employee who suffered an idiopathic fall while at work. See, e.g., Bagwell v. Ernest Burwell, Inc., 227 S.C. 444, 450, 888 S.E.2d 611, 613-14 (1955) (denying compensation where claimant failed to show any causal connection between the fall of the deceased and his employment when evidence indicated that deceasedâ€™s fall occurred while he was standing at his desk and â€œwas due to some internal failure or weaknessâ€); Miller v. Springs Cotton Mills, 225 S.C. 326, 330, 82 S.E.2d 458, 459 (1954) (finding claimant failed to show injury by accident arising out of and in the course of her employment where claimantâ€™s injury, which occurred in employerâ€™s cafeteria while she was eating lunch, was the result of â€œsome internal failure or breakdown in the knee which might have happened at any timeâ€); Crosby v. Wal-Mart Store, Inc., 330 S.C. 489, 493, 499 S.E.2d 253, 256 (Ct. App. 1998) (holding claimant not entitled to benefits because claimant failed to show causal connection between her fall and her employment where evidence indicated that claimant fell while walking on level floor in employerâ€™s store).Â  Unlike the above-cited cases, Murrayâ€™s injury occurred while he was performing the physical demands of maintaining the operation of the three frames.Â  In contrast, the employees in the cases cited by Employer were injured from an unexplained fall from walking on a level floor or a fall from a blackout.Â  \r\nFurthermore, the fact that Murray was not carrying, pushing, or lifting something, as Employer proposes is a necessary requirement, at the time of the injury is not dispositive of whether he was entitled to compensation.Â  We discern no such requirement under the standard of â€œarising out ofâ€ the course of employment.Â  See Ellis v. Spartan Mills, 276 S.C. 216, 219, 277 S.E.2d 590, 592 (1981) (finding claimant was entitled to compensation where evidence established that claimant, a loom operator, suffered her back injury during a work activity when she bent forward to retrieve a thread that was lying on the floor); Â Â Sigmon v. Dayco Corp., 316 S.C. 260, 262, 449 S.E.2d 497, 498 (Ct. App. 1994) (recognizing that â€œan injury by accidentâ€ does not necessarily require a causative event and stating â€œthe unexpected result or industrial injury is itself considered the compensable accidentâ€).\r\nII.\r\nEmployer asserts the circuit court erred in finding that Murray was injured when he twisted his neck at work.Â  Specifically, Employer argues â€œthere is absolutely no testimony that Claimant injured his neck as he was â€˜hurriedly raisingâ€™ up from being bent over, or that he was twisting his neck at the time of the injury.â€Â  Employer claims there are no facts to support that finding and, thus, it was reversible error to conclude that Murrayâ€™s claim was compensable.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs outlined above, Murray testified that he was in a hurry and working at a steady pace at the time of his injury. Â He also acknowledged that there was a â€œsense of urgencyâ€ when he went between machine number eight and machine number nine at the time of the injury.Â  Additionally, Murray testified that he hurt his neck and arm when he turned and twisted while going toward machine number nine.Â  He also stated that he felt pain in his neck and arm during the process of going between the two frames.Â  Murray specifically testified that he felt the pain â€œ[a]s soon [as] I turned, I twisted.â€Â  As previously stated, Dr. Oetting found that the history of the injury given by Murray was consistent with his findings of the two disc ruptures. Â Furthermore, the single commissionerâ€™s order, which was unanimously affirmed by the Full Commission, found Murray to be a â€œvery credible witness.â€Â  Accordingly, we reject Employerâ€™s claim that the circuit court mischaracterized the facts to reach the conclusion that Murrayâ€™s injury was compensable.\r\nBased on the foregoing, the order of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Employer does not appear to challenge whether Murrayâ€™s injury occurred in the course of his employment.Â  In its brief, Employer contends the injury â€œmerely happened at work but it was not caused by work.â€Â  Accordingly, we confine our analysis to a determination of whether the injury arose out of Murrayâ€™s employment.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-384","title":"Willard v.

Samuels, McWhirter Bellinger, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Clarke W. McCants, III, Nance &amp; McCants, of Aiken, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this workersâ€™ compensation case, the circuit court reversed the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commissionâ€™s award of benefits to the claimant, concluding that Commissionâ€™s findings were not supported by substantial evidence.Â  We reverse and remand to the circuit court to reinstate the Commissionâ€™s judgment.[1]Â  \r\nI.\r\nOn December 7, 2000, Gary Lee Willard (claimant) injured his neck and left shoulder during the scope and course of his employment with ASCO Valve Manufacturing (the employer). Â The employer and the insurance carrier (Emerson Electric Company) accepted the claim and provided benefits.Â  Claimant initially received treatment for his injury from his family doctor, Dr. James Bland.Â  Claimant continued to work for employer in a light duty status until March 2001, at which point he returned to full duty status.Â  \r\nIn a report dated February 4, 2002, Dr. James L. Becton, an orthopedic surgeon, opined that Claimant had reached maximum medical improvement and sustained a zero percent permanent physical impairment.Â  Â Â Dr. Bectonâ€™s assessment was consistent with an earlier (June 19, 2001) report by Dr. Ildemaro Volcan.Â  On February 5, 2002, claimant received notice that â€œit is the opinion of the insurer and employer that you have reached maximum medical improvement and . . . your workersâ€™ compensation claim is being closed.â€ Â \r\nIn May of 2002, the ASCO plant underwent a layoff.Â  The layoff was announced company wide on May 7, 2002.Â  In a memorandum dated May 10, Claimant was informed that his specific position would be eliminated on May 28th.Â  Claimant was given the choice of (1) working a lower-paying job within the company or (2) accepting the layoff.Â  On May 14, claimant selected the second option, but also wrote on the form: â€œBY SIGNING THIS, I AM NOT AGREEING TO A VOLUNTARY LAYOFF. Â I AM ONLY AGREEING TO THE CHOICE OF PAY.â€ \r\nClaimant last worked for employer on May 15, 2002; however, his departure was not under the terms of the layoff.Â  Claimant sought additional treatment from Dr. Bland on May 7, 2002.Â  On May 20, 2002, Dr. Bland wrote claimant out of work as of May 17, 2002 with a projected return to work on May 28, 2002 â€œor longer depending onâ€ a neurosurgical evaluation.Â  Dr. Blandâ€™s report noted claimantâ€™s assertion of â€œpain in neck and left arm.â€Â  Dr. Bland declined, however, to opine on whether claimantâ€™s injury was work related, deferring that determination to a neurosurgical evaluation.Â  In this regard, Dr. Bland referred claimant to Dr. Richard Mendel, a neurosurgeon.Â  It is undisputed that claimant was not forthright with Dr. Bland about his work history.Â  \r\nDr. Mendel evaluated claimant on May 8, 2002 and August 29, 2002.Â  In a report dated August 29, 2002, Dr. Mendel noted Claimantâ€™s MRI â€œin fact demonstrates a fragmented disc at the C6-7 level on the left.â€Â  Beyond claimantâ€™s objective injury, it is clear from Dr. Mendelâ€™s report that claimant lied to Dr. Mendel about his work historyâ€”telling Dr. Mendel he had not been able to work for two years. Â \r\nOn November 27, 2002, claimant was seen by Dr. Donald R. Johnson, a neurosurgeon.Â  Dr. Johnsonâ€™s review of claimantâ€™s May 29, 2002 MRI reflected â€œa high quality study and shows a clear left sided herniation at C6-C7.â€Â  It was Dr. Johnsonâ€™s opinion that claimant had not reached maximum medical improvement.Â  Dr. Johnson recommended surgery, and stated claimant should return to work only after surgery.Â  As with the other doctors, claimant was not completely forthright with Dr. Johnson concerning his work history.Â \r\nII.\r\nIn July 2002, claimant filed a Form 50 seeking additional medical treatment (for his neck, back, arm and hand) and temporary total disability benefits.Â  The employer filed a Form 51, denying the claim on the grounds Claimant had reached maximum medical improvement.Â  \r\nFollowing a hearing, the single commissioner found claimant had sustained a â€œ20% permanent partial disability to [his] neckâ€ and awarded compensation accordingly.Â  The single commissioner further found claimant had reached maximum medical improvement on February 4, 2002, and was not entitled to further medical treatment nor temporary compensation.Â  In so ruling, the single commissioner credited the evidence submitted by the employer.Â  \r\nThe single commissionerâ€™s decision was appealed to an appellate panel of the Commission (the Commission).Â  The Commission found claimant had not reached maximum medical improvement and was entitled to further medical treatment as well as temporary total benefits from November 27, 2002.Â  The Commission referenced the testimony of Dr. Johnson in finding claimant had not reached maximum medical improvement and awarding temporary total disability compensation.[2]Â  \r\nThe parties appealed to the circuit court, with the employer challenging the Commissionâ€™s findings regarding maximum medical improvement and entitlement to benefits and claimant challenging the November 27, 2002 start date.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s view of the evidence mirrored that of the single commissioner, as the circuit court â€œconclude[d] that the evidence in this matter fully supports [the single commissionerâ€™s] findingsâ€ and â€œmodifiedâ€ the Commissionâ€™s order â€œin accordance with such ruling [of the single commissioner].â€Â  Claimant appeals.\r\nIII.\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  â€œIn workersâ€™ compensation cases, the Full Commission is the ultimate fact finder.â€Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  Neither the circuit court nor this court may substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6).[3] As relevant to this case, the appellate court may reverse or modify the Commissionâ€™s decision only if the claimantâ€™s substantial rights have been prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law or is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  Id.Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor evidence viewed from one side, but such evidence, when the whole record is considered, as would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the Full Commission reached.â€Â  Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.\r\nIV.\r\nClaimant first asserts that the circuit court erred by making its own findings of fact regarding claimantâ€™s right to receive temporary total disability (TTD) compensation.Â  We agree.\r\nThe resolution of this appeal is controlled by the deferential substantial evidence scope of review.Â  The circuit court, sitting in its appellate capacity, engaged in impermissible fact-finding.Â  Because there is evidence to support the conclusion reached by the Commission, we are constrained (as was the circuit court) to sustain the findings of the Commission.Â  That the evidence may reasonably be viewed to preponderate toward the view advocated by the circuit court provides no basis or license to circumvent the substantial evidence scope of review.Â  Moreover, when the evidence is in conflict, as here, the substantial evidence test forecloses the re-weighing of evidence.\r\nThe circuit court held that â€œa valid medical opinion exists only when supported by a reliable and accurate history.Â  Absent such a history the opinion is, at best, questionable and of limited value.â€Â  Determining whether a medical opinionâ€”or any evidenceâ€”is â€œvalidâ€ or of â€œvalueâ€ strikes at the heart of the Commissionâ€™s mandated fact-finding role.Â  Moreover, it appears the circuit courtâ€™s take on the evidence is premised on the belief that claimantâ€™s entitlement to relief hinged solely on his credibility, especially as to his subjective complaints.Â  Such a view ignores the objective basisâ€”namely, the results of claimantâ€™s MRIâ€”of the opinions of Drs. Mendel and Johnson.Â Â  When the record as a whole is examined in light of the proper standard of review on appeal, the findings of the Commission (that claimant has not reached maximum medical improvement and is entitled to temporary total disability) are supported by substantial evidence.Â  We thus reverse the circuit court.\r\nV.\r\nClaimant next appeals the November 27, 2002 start date for TTD as determined by the Commission.Â  \r\nWhile we appreciate the basis of claimantâ€™s argument for the May 17, 2002 start date, we cannot say the Commissionâ€™s selection of November 27 falls below the substantial evidence test.Â  In this regard, the Commission could have reasonably elected not to credit claimantâ€™s testimony as to the unusual circumstances surrounding his departure from work in May.Â  While Dr. Bland opined claimant was unable to work as of May 17 based on claimantâ€™s subjective complaints, it was only Dr. Johnson who offered a definitive opinion concerning claimants inability to work based on objective findingsâ€”noting on November 27, 2002, after review of the MRI, that â€œ[t]he patient has certainly not reached maximum medical improvement and I feel should not be returned to the workplace until he has had the necessary surgery done.â€Â  Although the circuit court was critical of the Commissionâ€™s reliance on the â€œsingular evidenceâ€ of Dr. Johnson, reasonable minds could certainly reject claimantâ€™s reliance on Dr. Bland for a May 17 start date for TTD when one considers that Dr. Bland suggested a â€œreturn to work dateâ€ of May 28, 2002.Â  In addition, Dr. Bland expressly declined to offer an opinion as to whether claimantâ€™s injury was work related, opting to defer to a neurosurgical evaluation.Â  Accordingly, we reject claimantâ€™s challenge to the November 27, 2002 start date for TTD.\r\nVI.\r\nFor the reasons stated above, the order of the circuit court is reversed and the matter is remanded to the circuit court to reinstate the judgment of the Commission.\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\nKITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â Â \r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  The employerâ€™s carrier subsequently agreed to pay for claimantâ€™s surgery.\r\n[3] This code section was amended by Act No. 387, 2006 S.C. Acts 387; however, the applicable language at all times pertinent to the present appeal is found in section 1-23-680(A)(6) of the South Carolina Code (2005).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-385","title":"York Printing & Finishing v.

Stuckey, Jr., of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Springs Industries, Inc. (â€œSpringsâ€) appeals a jury verdict for York Printing &amp; Finishing, Inc. and Bonnie Watts (collectively â€œYork Printingâ€).Â  Springs argues the trial court erred in denying its motions for directed verdict and JNOV because Springs owed no duty of care to York Printing and York Printing put forth no evidence demonstrating Springsâ€™ negligent misrepresentation proximately caused York Printingâ€™s business failure.Â  Springs also argues the trial court erred in denying its unclean hands defense.Â  We affirm.Â Â  \r\n1.Â  Springs argues the trial court erred in denying its directed verdict motion on York Printingâ€™s cause of action for negligent misrepresentation because Springs owed no legal duty to York Printing.Â  The determination of the existence of a duty is a question of law.Â  Faile v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Juvenile Justice, 350 S.C. 315, 334, 566 S.E.2d 536, 545 (2002).Â  â€œA duty to exercise reasonable care in giving information exists when the defendant has a pecuniary interest in the transaction.â€Â  Winburn v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 287 S.C. 435, 441, 339 S.E.2d 142, 146 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  Further, if the defendant â€œpossesses expertise or special knowledge that would ordinarily make it reasonable for another to rely on his judgment or ability to make careful enquiry, the law places on him a duty of care with respect to representations made to plaintiff.â€Â  AMA Mgmt. Corp. v. Strasburger, 309 S.C. 213, 223, 420 S.E.2d 868, 874 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  Here, after Duke Power refused to provide information (citing privacy concerns) to York Printing regarding Springsâ€™ monthly utility costs for the Bleachery, York Printing turned to Springs for this informationâ€”information critical to York Printingâ€™s decision to proceed with the purchase of the Bleachery.Â  With a clear understanding of the importance of this information to York Printing, Springs provided York Printing with a chart of the Bleacheryâ€™s monthly utility costs for the preceding year, including the critical months of July and August of 1998.Â  This utility chart contained materially false information.Â  Springs had a pecuniary interest not only in selling the Bleachery to York Printing, but also in leasing-back portions of the Bleachery after the sale (and after York Printing agreed to pay for the Bleacheryâ€™s utility costs).Â  Springs possessed special knowledgeâ€”the Bleacheryâ€™s actual monthly utility costs for the preceding yearâ€”that York Printing could not obtain elsewhere.Â  Therefore, Springs had a duty to exercise reasonable care when it provided York Printing the utility chart.Â  Accordingly, the trial court properly denied Springsâ€™ directed verdict motion.\r\n2.Â  Springs argues the trial court erred in denying its directed verdict motion on York Printingâ€™s cause of action for negligent misrepresentation because York Printing offered no evidence showing Springs proximately caused York Printingâ€™s business failure.Â  â€œOrdinarily, the question of proximate cause is one of fact for the jury and the trial judgeâ€™s sole function regarding the issue is to inquire whether particular conclusions are the only reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the evidence.â€Â  McNair v. Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, 349, 499 S.E.2d 488, 497 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Evidence in the record supports the juryâ€™s finding that York Printingâ€™s business failure was the natural and probable consequence of Springsâ€™ false representationâ€”the gross understatement of the Bleacheryâ€™s electric bills.Â  York Printing presented evidence that it relied on Springsâ€™ utility chart, particularly the figures for the two months prior to York Printingâ€™s purchase of the Bleachery to determine whether it could turn a profit.Â  The record shows Springs understood the importance of these figures to York Printing, and York Printing relied on these figures to its detriment.Â  When the correct amounts are considered, two facts can be concluded.Â  First, York Printing would not have purchased the Bleachery had it known the true electric bills.Â  Second, the failure of York Printing may be attributed to its inability to operate profitably in light of the true electric bills.Â  These conclusions satisfy the element of proximate cause.Â  Accordingly, the trial court properly denied Springsâ€™ directed verdict motion and submitted the claim to the jury.\r\n3.Â  Springs argues the trial court erred in denying its unclean hands defense.Â  Where an equitable defense is raised against a legal action, the trial judge has the â€œresponsibility of making findings of fact as to the equitable defense.â€Â  Huguenin v. Wall, 279 S.C. 518, 521, 309 S.E.2d 794, 795 (Ct. App. 1983).Â  In such cases, the scope of review on appeal is de novo.Â  Id.Â  Here, Springs presents two pieces of evidence that it believes demonstrates York Printingâ€™s unclean hands.Â  First, York Printing represented to its lender that it had verbal commitments from purchasers to buy from York Printing after it began operations in the Bleachery, and Springs contends no such verbal commitments existed.Â  Second, York Printing represented to the federal government that it intended to create one hundred new jobs at the Bleachery, and Springs contends York Printing had no intention of creating that many new jobs.Â  The trial court found the facts of the case did not give rise to an unclean hands defense.Â  The record fully supports this finding.Â  Moreover, Springs cannot complain of York Printingâ€™s dealings with third parties, because the clean hands maxim does not apply to matters outside the transaction between plaintiff and defendant.Â  Arnold v. City of Spartanburg, 201 S.C. 523, 532, 23 S.E.2d 735, 738 (S.C. 1943) (â€œThe expression â€˜clean handsâ€™ means a clean record with respect to the transaction with the defendants themselves and not with respect to others.â€).Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in rejecting the unclean hands defense.\r\nThe judgment pursuant to the jury verdict is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-386","title":"SCDSS v.

Elliott,\r\nSenior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, of Columbia; and Solicitor Cecil Kelly Jackson, of Sumter; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: A jury convicted Dorian J. Cain of two counts of armed robbery, and the trial court sentenced him to concurrent terms of ten yearsâ€™ imprisonment.Â  On appeal, Cain argues the trial court erred in refusing to suppress the victimsâ€™ identifications, failing to dismiss the case for lack of probable cause, and in failing to grant his motion for a new trial.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn December 18, 2003, at approximately 11:00 a.m., James Reames and Edward Scott (collectively, â€œthe victimsâ€) were at a work-site moving chairs out of a building that was set to be demolished. Three young men approached and asked if the victims needed help.Â  When the victims looked up, two of the men, including a man later identified as Cain, pointed guns at them and demanded the victimsâ€™ wallets. Â After taking the wallets, the robbers fled.Â  The entire incident took approximately five minutes.Â  \r\nThe victims drove to a police station and reported the incident about ten minutes after it occurred.Â  They described the robbers as â€œthree young black males . . . one tall with a medium complexion wearing a white t-shirtâ€ and two shorter males with darker complexions.Â  \r\nOfficer Ernest Mosely was patrolling nearby when he heard a radio dispatch reporting the robbery and the victimsâ€™ description of the perpetrators. Â A few moments later, Officer Mosely observed an automobile driving through an intersection at an â€œunusual rate of speed.â€Â  He believed the automobile was traveling too fast for conditions because the street was narrow and the automobile failed to completely stop at a stop sign. Â The automobile was within two blocks of the scene of the robbery, and a passenger in the back kept turning around in his seat to watch the officer.Â  Officer Mosely observed four black males in the car, and in addition to the rear passenger who continued to turn around in his seat, Officer Mosely also noticed that the driver repeatedly looked into the rearview mirror.Â  Â \r\nOfficer Mosely activated his lights, and the automobile stopped.Â  At some point before the stop, Officer Mosely observed the rear passenger, later identified as Cain, remove a white t-shirt to reveal a black t-shirt he wore underneath.Â  The officer then radioed for back up because he believed the people inside the car might have been involved in the robbery.Â  When the other officers arrived at the scene, they ordered the suspects to exit the car.Â  The officers frisked and handcuffed the men.[1] Â Â They searched the car for weapons, but found none.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nSoon afterward, police brought the victims to the scene. Both immediately identified Cain as the person who robbed them.Â  They did not implicate the other men.Â  \r\nA grand jury indicted Cain on two counts of armed robbery.Â  On April 6, 2004, the case was tried before a jury.Â  Prior to opening statements, Cain moved to suppress the identifications of him made by the victims on the basis the show-up identification was unduly suggestive.Â  The trial court held an in camera hearing on the motion, which it ultimately denied.Â  During the in camera hearing, Cain also moved to have the case dismissed, arguing Officer Mosely lacked probable cause to stop the car.Â  The trial court denied the motion.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe jury found Cain guilty of two counts of armed robbery, and the trial court sentenced him to two concurrent terms of ten yearsâ€™ imprisonment.Â  After trial, Cain filed a motion, pursuant to Rule 29(b), SCRCP, to set aside the verdict based on after-discovered evidence.Â  The motion was based on an affidavit of Reames that recanted his trial testimony identifying Cain as one of the robbers.Â  The affidavit provided:\r\n\r\nThis statement certifies that I am changing my statement back to my original.Â  I am not sure who robbed us on Dec. 18.Â  I can not clearly identify Dorian Cain.Â  I only changed my statement because I was instructed by the police department that Dorian was the suspect.Â  I could not really identify the suspect because of the dark lighting in the building.Â  Again I can not state Dorian Cain robbed me and I am willingly changing my statement.Â  \r\n\r\nDuring the hearing on Cainâ€™s motion, Reames testified he could not read or write very well, and he denied writing the recantation.Â  He admitted signing the affidavit, but stated he believed the document only changed a court date.Â  Â Â Â Reames testified he still believed Cain robbed him and denied making any statement to the contrary.Â  In contrast, Juanita Robinson testified that she and Cainâ€™s sister read the affidavit to Reames before they went to the courthouse to have the document notarized.Â  \r\nThe trial court found Cain cross-examined Reames on the issue of whether he was sure Cain was one of the robbers.Â  Further, the trial court found that recantation testimony is inherently unreliable and, in any case, Reames denied making the statement in the affidavit. Â Accordingly, the trial court denied the motion.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Motion to Suppress \r\nCain argues the trial court erred by failing to suppress the victimsâ€™ out of court identification of him.Â  He contends the show-up identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive, and therefore the identification of him was unreliable.Â  Although we agree the show-up might have been suggestive, we find under the totality of the circumstances that the identification of Cain was nonetheless reliable. \r\nA criminal defendant â€œmay be deprived of due process of law by an identification procedure which is unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification.â€Â  State v. Moore, 343 S.C. 282, 286, 540 S.E.2d 445, 448 (2000) (citing Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293 (1967)).Â  A confrontation which is suggestive is disapproved of because of the increased likelihood of misidentification; however, suggestiveness in and of itself does not mandate the exclusion of evidence.Â  State v. Tisdale, 338 S.C. 607, 612, 527 S.E.2d 389, 392 (2000) (citing Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 198 (1972)).Â  The key factor in deciding whether identification testimony is admissible is reliability.Â  Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, 114 (1977).Â  \r\nTo determine whether an out-of-court identification is sufficiently reliable to warrant admission, South Carolina employs the two-prong inquiry developed by the United States Supreme Court in Neil v. Biggers.Â  409 U.S. at 199-201.Â  The first prong considers whether the identification process was unduly suggestive.Â  State v. Brown, 356 S.C. 496, 503, 589 S.E.2d 781, 784, (Ct. App. 2003).Â  If the identification procedure is deemed suggestive, we then consider the second prong of the analysis: whether a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification occurred.Â  Moore, 343 S.C. at 287, 540 S.E.2d at 447-48.Â  â€œAlthough one-on-one show ups have been sharply criticized, and are inherently suggestive, the identification need not be excluded as long as under the circumstances the identification was reliableâ€ despite the suggestive procedure.Â  Id. at 287, 540 S.E.2d at 448 (finding show-up procedure unduly suggestive where witness was brought to a location where two individuals wearing similar clothing to that described by the witness were surrounded by uniformed police).Â  Therefore, the overarching inquiry is whether under the totality of circumstances a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification exists.Â  Id.Â \r\nIn assessing the first part of our inquiry, we find the trial court erred in ruling the show-up procedure was not unduly suggestive.Â  An officer brought the two witnesses to a location where four young men stood handcuffed amidst uniformed police officers.Â  Because the officer took the witnesses to a location that included suspects only, the show up procedure was suggestive.Â  See id. at 287-288, 540 S.E.2d at 448 (citing In the Interest of Jamal Rashee A., 308 S.C. 392, 418 S.E.2d 326 (Ct. App. 1992) ( finding â€œtaking witness to location where suspects, but no other individuals, are being detained is suggestiveâ€)).\r\nDespite finding the show-up procedure suggestive, we can still uphold the admission of the identification testimony if, under the totality of the circumstances, the identification is deemed reliable and the opportunity for misidentification is slight.Â  The factors to be considered in evaluating the likelihood of misidentification include the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witnessâ€™s degree of attention, the accuracy of the witnessâ€™s prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty displayed by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of time between the crime and the confrontation.Â  State v. Blassingame, 338 S.C. 240, 252, 525 S.E.2d 535, 541 (Ct. App. 1999) (citations omitted).Â  \r\nApplying these factors to the present case, we find the witnessesâ€™ identification testimony reliable.Â  The robbery occurred at 11:00 a.m. in a well-illuminated building.Â  There, both victims saw Cain for at least five minutes.Â  The robber was not wearing any sort of disguise, and both witnesses testified to looking at Cainâ€™s face primarily because he had a gun.Â  Moreover, as a barber, Scott testified he was trained to notice â€œeverything about a manâ€™s face or headâ€ and accordingly, paid particular attention to Cain.Â  Both witnesses testified to being afraid, and presumably paid closer attention because they were fearful for their lives.Â  Id. at 252, 252 S.E.2d at 541-542 (â€œA person in fear of his life presumably has a more acute degree of attention to his surroundings than a mere passerby.â€).Â  Finally, the witnesses each testified they had seen Cain in the neighborhood before and were actually able to recognize his face, not just remember a face unfamiliar to them.Â  \r\nFurther, Cain also fit the descriptions given by the witnesses, both of whom immediately identified him as one of the robbers.Â  Additionally, only thirty minutes elapsed from the time the witnesses reported the robbery until they identified Cain as one of the robbers.Â  Shortly after the crime occurred, the police apprehended Cain near the crime scene.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying Cainâ€™s motion to suppress the witnessesâ€™ pre-trial identification of him.Â  \r\nII. Â Â Â Â  Probable Cause\r\nCain argues the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss because there was neither probable cause to justify the stop[2] nor reasonable suspicion to seize the passengers after the stop.Â Â  We disagree.\r\n&nbsp;â€œThe decision to stop an automobile is reasonable where the police have probable cause to believe a traffic violation has occurred.â€ State v. Woodruff,&nbsp; 344 S.C. 537, 546, 544 S.E.2d 290, 295&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001) (citing Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806 (1996)).Â  Further, â€œ[a] police officer may stop and briefly detain and question a person for investigative purposes, without treading upon his Fourth Amendment rights, when the officer has a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts, short of probable cause for arrest, that the person is involved in criminal activity.Â  Id., 344 S.C. at 546, 544 S.E.2d at 295 (citing United States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411 (1981)). In determining whether a stop based upon reasonable suspicion violated the Fourth Amendment, the trial court â€œmust consider the totality of the circumstances before the officer and whether these circumstances raise a suspicion that the particular individual being stopped is engaged in criminal activity.â€Â  State v. Alexander, 309 S.C. 495, 498, 424 S.E.2d 526, 528-29 (1992) (citing United States v. Cortez, 499 U.S. 411 (1981)).Â  \r\nIn the present case, Officer Mosely learned a robbery had recently occurred and immediately proceeded to the scene.Â  He had just exited his police vehicle to interview people in the area when he first observed the automobile.Â  The automobile had four men in it and was traveling too fast for the particular area.Â  Further, Officer Mosely testified the automobile did not completely stop at a stop sign. Â Additionally, the driver continuously looked back at him instead of observing where he was going.Â  Officer Mosely activated his blue lights and radioed for back up because he believed â€œthe persons inside may be involved with the crime.â€Â  He noticed Cain, in the backseat, kept moving and appeared to put on a different T-shirt.Â  \r\nFrom this testimony, there is evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s conclusion that Officer Mosely had probable cause to stop the vehicle because of the traffic violations the driver committed.Â  Further, Officer Mosely could briefly detain the occupants in the vehicle because he had reasonable suspicion that they were involved in criminal activity: the automobile was within two blocks of where the robbery occurred and both the driver and a rear-seat passenger repeatedly looked back at Officer Mosely.Â  See Alexander, 309 S.C. at 498-99, 424 S.E.2d at 529 (finding officer had reasonable basis to suspect automobile passengers were engaged in criminal activity because automobile was in a high crime area, had out-of-state tags, and passenger kept turning around to watch the police vehicle).Â  Officer Moselyâ€™s suspicions were further aroused when Cain took off his white T-shirt.Â  Accordingly, after examining the totality of the circumstances, we find evidence to support the trial judgeâ€™s refusal to dismiss the case because Officer Mosely had both probable cause to initiate the stop and a reasonable suspicion to detain the passengers.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIII.Â Â Â  New Trial\r\nFinally, Cain argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial based upon after discovered evidence.Â Â  We disagree.\r\nFor a defendant to prevail on a motion for a new trial based on after discovered evidence, he must show the evidence (1) â€œis such as will probably change the result if a new trial is granted;â€ (2) the evidence has been discovered after the trial has ended; (3) the evidence could not have been discovered by the use of due diligence; (4) â€œthe evidence is material;â€ and (5) the evidence is not cumulative or impeaching.Â  State v. Needs,&nbsp;333 S.C. 134, 157-58, 508 S.E.2d 857, 869&nbsp;(1998) (citing State v. Prince, 316 S.C. 57, 447 S.E.2d 177 (1993)).Â  Further, â€œthe granting of such a motion is not favored and, absent error of law or abuse of discretion,â€ this court will not disturb the trial courtâ€™s denial of a motion for a new trial.Â  Id.Â  (citations omitted).\r\nHere, the asserted after-discovered evidence is an affidavit signed by Reames purportedly disavowing his statement at trial identifying Cain as one of the men who robbed him.Â  However, Reames later testified that he did not recant his prior testimony and continued to identify Cain as the robber.Â Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court has previously held â€œrecantation of testimony ordinarily is unreliable and should be subjected to the closest scrutiny when offered as ground for a new trial.â€Â  State v. Porter,&nbsp;269 S.C. 618, 621, 239 S.E.2d 641, 643&nbsp;(1977).Â  In this case, we are presented with conflicting evidence: an affidavit recanting statements made during trial and the testimony of the affiant during the hearing in which he denied the content of the affidavit.Â  When issues of credibility arise, the trial court, not this court, has the discretion to weigh the evidence.Â  See State v. Parker, 249 S.C. 139, 141, 153 S.E.2d 183, 184 (1967) (â€œIt is a fixed rule that the credibility of newly-discovered evidence offered in support of a motion for a new trial is a matter for determination by the [trial court] . . . [the trial court] not this court [has] the power to weigh such evidence.â€).Â  Further, by denying the content of the affidavit, Reames essentially left Cain without any ground for the new trial because at best, the affidavit could only be used to impeach Reamesâ€™ trial testimony.Â  See Needs, 333 S.C. at 157-158, 508 S.E.2d at 869 (finding a ground for a new trial may not be based upon evidence that is â€œmerely cumulative or impeachingâ€).Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court properly denied Cainâ€™s new trial motion.\r\nMoreover, even if Reames had not disavowed the affidavit and recanted his trial testimony, Cain failed to establish the after-discovered evidence would have changed the outcome of the trial.Â  See id.,&nbsp;333 S.C. at 158, 508 S.E.2d at 869 (â€œ[Although] the Stateâ€™s case against appellant was not overwhelming, especially since the Stateâ€™s key witness had offered so many contradictory statements . . . we do not believe the evidence appellant would present at a new trial would change the outcome of the trial.â€).Â  The other victim, James Scott also identified Cain as one of the robbers. Â Furthermore, the State presented evidence that a police officer saw Cain in close proximity to the scene of the robbery just before it occurred.Â  Officer Mosely testified that he apprehended Cain shortly after the crime.Â Â  Here, even without Reamesâ€™ testimony, we find the State presented ample evidence from which the jury could find Cain guilty.Â  Accordingly, Cain has not met his burden in showing how the after-discovered evidence would have changed the outcome of trial.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the trial court properly denied Cainâ€™s motion to suppress the victimsâ€™ pre-trial identification of him.Â  Further, the trial court did not err in finding probable cause existed to initiate the stop.Â  Lastly, the trial court did not err by failing to grant Cainâ€™s motion for a new trial based on after-discovered evidence.Â  Accordingly, Cainâ€™s conviction is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] There is some dispute in the record whether the police handcuffed all the occupants in the car or just Cain.Â  Mr. Reames testified in camera that Cain was the only one in handcuffs.Â  The officers at the scene, however, testified that all the suspects were handcuffed.Â  \r\n[2] Although we assume for purposes of this opinion that Cain had standing, we need not decide the issue because we find the officerâ€™s stop of the vehicle was justified in any event.Â  Â See Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (explaining the appellate court need not address an issue already resolved by other means).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-388","title":"State v.

Peace, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: John H. Garvin appeals from his convictions for assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct with a minor and lewd act on a minor.Â  Garvin argues the trial court erred in refusing to allow him to introduce evidence of the victimâ€™s behavior problems at school to rebut the Stateâ€™s evidence that the victim passively succumbed to a sexual assault by an adult.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn December 30, 2002, Garvin spent the night at the eleven-year-old victimâ€™s home. Â Garvin was a long-time friend of the victimâ€™s family and was in a relationship with the victimâ€™s grandmother. Â In the home that night were the victimâ€™s mother; her boyfriend; a woman named Linda, who was also a friend of the familyâ€™s; and Garvin.Â  Â All the adults, with the exception of motherâ€™s boyfriend, were drinking that evening.Â  Sometime after midnight, they began retiring from the living room into their bedrooms. Â The mother and her boyfriend went to the master bedroom, the victim went to his bedroom, and Linda was supposed to sleep in the victimâ€™s brotherâ€™s bedroom while Garvin slept on the couch.Â  Apparently, Linda did not go to her designated bedroom, and Garvin went to the victimâ€™s mother to complain that Linda was bothering him.Â  The victimâ€™s mother suggested he go to the victimâ€™s bedroom for a few minutes in hopes Linda would leave him alone. Garvin did as he was told, and the victim testified Garvin lay beside him on the bed.Â  According to the victim, Garvin then pulled down the victimâ€™s pajama pants and touched his â€œprivates.â€ At that point, the victimâ€™s mother walked into the room to inform Garvin that Linda had left the living room and had gone to bed.Â  Garvin left the room.Â  \r\nThe victim testified that later in the night, Garvin returned to the victimâ€™s room and again removed the victimâ€™s pajama pants.Â  This time, Garvin attempted to penetrate the victimâ€™s anus.Â  Garvin then left the bedroom and went into the other bedroom where Linda was sleeping.Â  The victim went to the bathroom and noticed something wet on his leg.Â  He testified that he was too scared to tell anyone about the incident the next morning because Garvin was still at his house.Â  The afternoon following the incident, the victim visited with his father for a few days. Â The victim testified he did not tell his father about what happened because he was afraid his father would kill Garvin.Â  Once the victim returned to his motherâ€™s house, he informed her of the incident. Â His mother testified she was so distraught over the news that she kept the victim out of school for two days.Â  On the third day, the victimâ€™s mother brought the victim to the school counselorâ€™s office, where the victim reported what had happened. Â The counselor contacted the police. \r\nDuring the investigation, the police learned the sheets on the victimâ€™s bed and the victimâ€™s pajamas had been washed while the victim had visited his father; however, the quilt on the victimâ€™s bed had not been washed. Â The police sent the quilt to SLED.Â  Test results revealed that the quilt contained Garvinâ€™s sperm and that the sperm was not mixed with any genetic material from a female.Â  \r\nGarvin was indicted and tried for assault with attempt to commit criminal sexual conduct with a minor and lewd act on a minor.Â  Prior to trial, he made a motion seeking to introduce school and mental health records which indicated the victim had gotten in trouble numerous times for arguing with adults, deliberately annoying people, and blaming others for his mistakes.Â  The trial court denied the motion, finding none of the records shed light on the victimâ€™s credibility. Â \r\nAt trial, Garvin denied the allegations.Â  He claimed that the quilt on which his sperm was found had been part of the bedding given to him for his overnight stay on the couch.Â  According to Garvin, he and Linda attempted to have sex, but he ejaculated prematurely onto the quilt.Â  \r\nThe jury convicted Garvin, and the trial judge sentenced Garvin to concurrent sentences of twenty years for the assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct and fifteen years for the lewd act.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe decision to admit or exclude evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 556, 654 S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002).Â Â Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on legal error or when there are no facts to support the ruling.Â Â  State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 325, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467 (2000).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGarvinâ€™s only argument on appeal is that the trial court erred in refusing to admit the victimâ€™s school and mental health records.Â  Specifically, Garvin argues the behavioral records were relevant to show â€œboth that Doe was the type of child who confronted adults â€“ not passively succumbed â€“ and that Doe was likely to invent the incident to direct attention to himself.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œEvidence is relevant if it tends to establish or make more or less probable some matter in issue upon which it directly or indirectly bears.â€Â  State v. Alexander, 303 S.C. 377, 380, 401 S.E.2d 146, 148 (1991).Â  Character evidence is generally not relevant, except that evidence of a â€œpertinentâ€ character trait of a crime victim offered by an accused can be admitted.Â  Rule 404(a)(2),\r\nSCRE.\r\nThe trial court found the school records did not reveal a pertinent character trait, and there is evidence in the record to support that finding.Â  See State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001) (explaining the appellate court will affirm the trial courtâ€™s determination regarding the admissibility of evidence if there is any evidence to support that determination).Â  Here, the school records merely showed the victim had a history of being defiant and oppositional toward adults.Â  Although the defense argues this evidence would rebut the victimâ€™s claim that he â€œpassively submitted to [Garvin] without making any commotion,â€ we do not believe a childâ€™s reaction to a teacherâ€™s authority in any way gauges that childâ€™s reaction to being sexually assaulted.Â  Unlike the State, which presented an expert witness to explain why children often delay reporting a sexual assault, the defense did not present any authority to support its argument that a child who misbehaves in school would aggressively resist the sexual advances of a family friend.Â  Because the school and mental health records did not indicate the victim had a history of untruthfulness or of making false accusations, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding them as irrelevant.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, Garvinâ€™s conviction is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215(a), SCACR.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
