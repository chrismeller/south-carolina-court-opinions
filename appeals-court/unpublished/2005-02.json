Mobley, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-077\r\nHeard December 8, 2004 â€“ Filed February \r\n  4, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJan L. Warner, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nJ. Mark Taylor, of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is an appeal from the \r\n  identification of marital property and apportionment of the marital estate.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nLloyd and Emma Strickland were married in 1966.Â  \r\n  It was the third marriage for both.Â  They remained married and lived together \r\n  until 1999 when Lloyd suffered a series of falls.Â  As a result of these falls, \r\n  Lloyd was moved to an assisted living facility near the family home.Â  The decision \r\n  to place Lloyd in an assisted living facility was made by Sandra Kelly, his \r\n  daughter and attorney-in-fact.Â  \r\nAfter Lloyd was placed in the assisted living facility, \r\n  his daughter contributed $300 per month as support to Emma and continued paying \r\n  certain bills.Â  By March 2000, Emma was no longer able to care for herself and \r\n  was moved to a nursing home in Columbia by Alexandria Skinner, her granddaughter \r\n  and attorney-in-fact.Â  In May of 2000, Kelly had her father moved to a nursing \r\n  facility near her home in California.Â  \r\nOn June 9, 2000 Skinner, as attorney-in-fact for the \r\n  Wife, filed this action in the family court.Â  She named Kelly, individually \r\n  and as the Husbandâ€™s attorney-in-fact, as a defendant as well as the Husband.Â  \r\n  Skinner complained that Lloyd was not adequately providing for Emmaâ€™s expenses \r\n  and sought equitable division of the marital estate.Â  She requested a restraining \r\n  order to preserve the Husbandâ€™s assets, an order of separate support and maintenance, \r\n  equitable distribution, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nThe Husband died three weeks later on June 30, 2000.Â  \r\n  He was 91 years old.Â Â  The Wife died on June 25, 2001.Â  She was 85.Â Â Â  After \r\n  the death of the Wife, Lloydâ€™s estate moved for dismissal of the action for \r\n  lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  The motion was denied.Â  The action proceeded \r\n  with the estates of the Husband and Wife substituted as parties, with Skinner \r\n  as the personal representative of the estate of the Wife and Kelly as the personal \r\n  representative of the estate of the Husband. \r\nAfter a complex procedural history, a final hearing \r\n  was held and the family court heard testimony from Skinner, Kelly, and Mark \r\n  T. Hobbes, a certified public accountant.Â  The court found assets in the Husbandâ€™s \r\n  name were valued at $512,251.66 and the assets in the Wifeâ€™s name were valued \r\n  at $519,309.00 as of the time of the filing of this action.Â  The court determined \r\n  the entire amount was deemed marital property.Â  It ordered equal equitable distribution \r\n  of the marital estate, which caused the Wifeâ€™s estate to owe $3,528.50 to the \r\n  Husbandâ€™s estate.Â  Following the family courtâ€™s denial of her motion to reconsider, \r\n  the Wifeâ€™s estate appealed to this court.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has \r\n  authority to find the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, \r\n  157 (1996).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard \r\n  the findings of the family court.Â  Greene v. Greene, 351 S.C. 329, 335, \r\n  569 S.E.2d 393, 397 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  We are mindful that the family court judge, \r\n  who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their \r\n  credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Miles v. Miles, \r\n  355 S.C. 511, 516, 586 S.E.2d 136, 139 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nThe family court has broad discretion in determining \r\n  how marital property is to be valued and distributed.Â  Murphy v. Murphy, \r\n  319 S.C. 324, 329, 461 S.E.2d 39, 41 (1995).Â  Therefore, the family court may \r\n  use any reasonable means to divide the property equitably, and its judgment \r\n  will only be disturbed where abuse of discretion is found.Â  Id. at 329, \r\n  461 S.E.2d at 41-42.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Wifeâ€™s estate argues the family court erred \r\n  in finding all of the assets titled in her name were marital property.Â  We disagree. \r\n  [1] \r\nMarital property is defined as all real and \r\n  personal property acquired by the parties during the marriage that is owned \r\n  as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation, regardless of \r\n  how legal title is held.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2004).Â  Generally, \r\n  property acquired by either party before the marriage constitutes nonmarital \r\n  property.Â  However, nonmarital property may be transmuted into marital property.Â  \r\n  Â§ 20-7-473(2).Â  Whether property has been transmuted is a matter of intent to \r\n  be gleaned from the facts of each case.Â  Hatfield v. Hatfield, 327 S.C. \r\n  360, 368, 489 S.E.2d 212, 217 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  The party claiming the property \r\n  was transmuted must produce objective evidence that during the marriage, the \r\n  parties themselves regarded the property as common property.Â  Id.Â  This \r\n  evidence may include:Â  (1) placing the property in joint names; (2) transferring \r\n  the property to the other spouse as a gift; (3) using the property exclusively \r\n  for marital property; (4) commingling the property with marital property; (5) \r\n  using marital funds to build equity in the property; or (6) exchanging the property \r\n  for marital property.Â  Id.\r\nThe Wifeâ€™s estate argues the marital residence in \r\n  Summerville, South Carolina was not marital property because it was purchased \r\n  from the proceeds of property the Wife had owned prior to the marriage.Â  The \r\n  family court determined the residence was transmuted because it had been commingled \r\n  with the property of the parties.Â  While the marital residence was only titled \r\n  in the Wifeâ€™s name, we find sufficient evidence to support the family courtâ€™s \r\n  conclusion that the property was transmuted.Â  See Corbett v. Corbett, \r\n  313 S.C. 184, 187, 437 S.E.2d 136, 138 (Ct. App. 1993) (stating the manner in \r\n  which title is held is irrelevant in determining whether property is marital).Â  \r\n  The residence was used exclusively as the marital home for eleven years.Â  \r\n  Additionally, evidence in the form of checks and notations showed that the Husband \r\n  paid at least $36,000 towards satisfying the note on the house.Â  This evidence \r\n  demonstrates a specific intent by the parties to treat the marital residence \r\n  as marital property.\r\nThe Wifeâ€™s estate asserts the family court should \r\n  have excluded the checks showing Lloyd had retired $36,000 of the house debt \r\n  because the Husbandâ€™s estate failed to produce them during discovery.Â  First, \r\n  we find this argument is not properly before this court because the Wifeâ€™s estate \r\n  failed to include this issue in its statement of the issues on appeal.Â  See \r\n  Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (â€œOrdinarily, no point will be considered which is \r\n  not set forth in the statement of the issues on appeal.â€).Â  Furthermore, we \r\n  find no reversible error in the family courtâ€™s admission of the checks.Â  The \r\n  decision of what kind and whether to impose discovery sanctions is left to the \r\n  sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Fields v. Regâ€™l Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, \r\n  354 S.C. 445, 457, 581 S.E.2d 489, 495 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œIn deciding what sanction \r\n  to impose, the circuit court should weigh the nature of the interrogatories, \r\n  the discovery posture of the case, willfulness, and the degree of prejudice.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  The burden is on the appealing party to show the trial court abused \r\n  its discretion in its decision regarding the imposition of sanctions.Â  Halverson \r\n  v. Yawn, 328 S.C. 618, 621, 493 S.E.2d 883, 884 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nThe attorney for the Wifeâ€™s estate explained that \r\n  although Kelly had sent him copies of the checks, they were misplaced in a file.Â  \r\n  Additionally, while the checks themselves were not provided prior to trial, \r\n  an exhibit list was exchanged the day prior to trial listing two checks regarding \r\n  the marital residence.Â  Although on appeal, the Wifeâ€™s estate argues that it \r\n  was prejudiced by the failure to produce the copies of the checks because it \r\n  was not given the opportunity to investigate the authenticity of the checks \r\n  or whether they were used for the purposes asserted by the Husbandâ€™s estate, \r\n  it failed to make this argument to the trial court.Â  Accordingly, it is not \r\n  preserved for our consideration.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 \r\n  S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot \r\n  be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled \r\n  upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).Â  Considering \r\n  the Husbandâ€™s estateâ€™s explanation that his failure to produce was by mistake \r\n  rather than bad motive and the Wifeâ€™s estateâ€™s failure to demonstrate prejudice, \r\n  we hold the family court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the copies \r\n  of the checks into evidence.Â  \r\nWe also find that the family court did not err \r\n  in including the other assets titled in the Wifeâ€™s name in the marital estate.Â  \r\n  Skinner did not dispute that the Husband had given her grandmother an annuity \r\n  in 1994 in the sum of $277,300.00.Â  The Wife had cashed this and added the proceeds \r\n  to her assets.Â  The Wifeâ€™s income included increased Social Security payments \r\n  due to the Husbandâ€™s employment.Â  In addition, as the Wifeâ€™s estateâ€™s expert \r\n  witness testified, the Wife expended considerable sums on household expenses \r\n  in support of the marriage over the years.Â  Thus, we conclude the family court \r\n  did not err in valuing the marital estate at $1,031,561.00.Â  \r\nThe Wifeâ€™s estate also argues the family court \r\n  improperly apportioned the marital estate.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe family court must consider fifteen factors \r\n  and give each weight as it finds appropriate.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. \r\n  2004).Â  â€œOn review, we look to the fairness of the overall apportionment; if \r\n  the end result is equitable, it is irrelevant that we might have weighed specific \r\n  factors differently than the family court.â€Â  Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 \r\n  S.C. 88, 100, 545 S.E.2d 531, 537 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nThe Wifeâ€™s estate takes particular issue with the \r\n  family courtâ€™s finding that the husband â€œhad all earned income during the marriage \r\n  while [the Wife] contributed passive income from alternative sources.â€Â  The \r\n  Wifeâ€™s estate argues no evidence supports this finding.Â  We hold the Wifeâ€™s \r\n  estate has mischaracterized this finding.Â  The family court did not belittle \r\n  the Wifeâ€™s contributions to the marriage.Â  It recognized that the wife had income \r\n  from passive sources such as investments and social security and also contributed \r\n  to the marriage as the primary homemaker, but also found she was not a wage-earner.Â  \r\n  Skinner acknowledged that her grandmother had not held outside employment during \r\n  the course of her marriage to the Husband.Â  \r\nAlthough the evidence as to the Husbandâ€™s employment \r\n  is sketchy, there is evidence in the record to support the family courtâ€™s determination \r\n  that the Husband was the only wage earner.Â  Kelly stated her father worked hard \r\n  all of his life.Â  The certified public accountant the Wifeâ€™s estate presented \r\n  as an expert witness, Mark Thomas Hobbs, testified that the Wifeâ€™s social security \r\n  income probably came from drawing upon the Husbandâ€™s social security.Â  He acknowledged \r\n  that the Husbandâ€™s higher social security income indicated outside employment.Â  \r\n  In addition, he recognized that the Husband had a pension income, which also \r\n  indicated past outside employment.Â  \r\nWe disagree with the Wifeâ€™s estateâ€™s assertion that \r\n  the Husband did not contribute to the marriage.Â  Although Kelly recognized that \r\n  her father was extremely frugal, there is no evidence in the record that he \r\n  lived off of the Wife during the course of the marriage.Â  Kelly testified the \r\n  Husband paid certain household bills, including utilities, from his checking \r\n  account and gave the Wife $300.00 a month for additional expenses.Â  Kelly continued \r\n  these payments after the Husband went into the assisted living facility.Â  In \r\n  addition, the Husband paid $36,000 toward the mortgage of the marital residence.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, at the time of the filing of the action, the Husband had assets \r\n  in his name valued at $512,251.66.Â  There is no indication in the record these \r\n  assets came from the Wife.Â  Instead, it is undisputed the Husband gave the Wife \r\n  a $277,300.00 annuity.Â  \r\nIn determining the parties were entitled to equal \r\n  equitable apportionment of the marital estate, the family court carefully considered \r\n  and set-down in its order its conclusions on the relevant factors.Â  We find \r\n  no error in this determination.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons discussed, the identification of marital property and apportionment \r\n  ordered by the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  We note the unusual procedural history of this case and agree with \r\n    the family court that the death of the parties does not terminate a proceeding \r\n    regarding property rights because the courtâ€™s jurisdiction vested at the time \r\n    the suit was filed.Â  See Hodge v. Hodge, 305 S.C. 521, 524, \r\n    409 S.E.2d 436, 438 (Ct. App. 1991) (holding that upon the institution or \r\n    filing of marital litigation, the marital estate vests and with respect to \r\n    the equitable division of marital property, marital litigation is not abated \r\n    by the death of a spouse).Â  However, we are disconcerted that this action \r\n    was initiated and litigated by the partiesâ€™ attorneys-in-fact and then the \r\n    personal representatives of their estates when the parties themselves had \r\n    not suffered from marital discord.Â  Considering the aging population and the \r\n    proliferation of second marriages, the possibility is increasing for marital \r\n    litigation brought by the children from prior marriages of the parties.Â  As \r\n    the Wifeâ€™s counsel stated at oral argument, this type of litigation could \r\n    be used by the children of one spouse to obtain a share of the other spouseâ€™s \r\n    non-probate assets, which are not eligible for an elective share.Â Â Â  While \r\n    we question whether such litigation is within the purpose of the family courtâ€™s \r\n    jurisdiction, we must look to the legislature to place limits on that type \r\n    of action. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-078","title":"State v.

Konduros, Family Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-082\r\nSubmitted February 1, 2005 â€“ Filed February \r\n  4, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nRichard H. Rhodes, of Spartanburg, for Appellant.\r\nBrendan M. Delaney, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Debra M. Knight (Wife) initiated \r\n  this domestic relations action against Jack Knight, Jr. (Husband).Â  The family \r\n  court awarded Wife a divorce on the ground of adultery, ordered Husband to pay \r\n  alimony, and made an equitable distribution of the partiesâ€™ assets.Â  Husband \r\n  made a Rule 60(b) motion which was denied.Â  He appeals the denial of this motion.Â  \r\n  We affirm. [1] Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn October 21, 2002, the family court \r\n  granted Wife a divorce on the ground of Husbandâ€™s adultery.Â  The courtâ€™s order \r\n  awarded Wife the marital home and a machine shop located adjacent to the home.Â  \r\n  Additionally, Wife was given responsibility for both mortgages on the residence \r\n  as well as a $20,000 loan obtained to purchase machinery.Â  The parties agreed \r\n  the value of the home was $68,000.Â  Husband was ordered to pay $650 per month \r\n  in permanent, periodic alimony, and Wife was awarded attorneyâ€™s fees.Â Â  \r\nHusband did not appeal.Â  However, on December 20, \r\n  2002, Husband filed a motion pursuant to Rule 60(b), SCRCP.Â  Therein, Husband \r\n  asserted the following: (1) the valuation of the marital home was erroneous; \r\n  (2) the valuation of the mortgages on the home was erroneous; (3) the treatment \r\n  of the loan for business equipment as marital debt was erroneous; (4) the valuation \r\n  of Husbandâ€™s pension plans was erroneous; (5) the valuation and distribution \r\n  of the partiesâ€™ personal property was erroneous; (6) Husband should have been \r\n  given credit for certain payments towards marital debt; (7) the valuation of \r\n  the machine shop equipment was erroneous; (8) due to Husbandâ€™s psychological \r\n  condition at the time of the hearing, he was unable â€œto completely comprehend \r\n  the proceedings and to assist in the presentation of the case as he should have \r\n  beenâ€; (9) Wife had not yet paid sums she agreed to pay for the appraisals of \r\n  the home and machine shop equipment; and (10) the division of marital assets \r\n  was erroneous.\r\nThe family court denied Husbandâ€™s Rule 60(b) motion, \r\n  with the sole exception that Wife was ordered to pay Husband the $100 she owed \r\n  him for the appraisals of the marital home and the machine shop equipment.Â  \r\n  Husband appeals this order, contending the court should have granted his motion \r\n  under Rule 60(b). Â We affirm.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nRule 60(b), SCRCP, provides, in pertinent \r\n  part:\r\nOn motion and upon such terms as are just, the court \r\n  may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, \r\n  or proceeding for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;\r\n(2)Â Â Â Â  newly discovered evidence which by due diligence \r\n  could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b);\r\n(3)Â Â Â Â  fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of \r\n  an adverse party;\r\n(4)Â Â Â Â  the judgment is void;\r\n(5) Â Â Â  the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, \r\n  or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, \r\n  or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.\r\n\r\nâ€œ[M]otions for relief under Rule 60(b) \r\n  are addressed to the discretion of the court and appellate review is limited \r\n  to determining whether the trial court abused its discretion.â€Â  Saro v. Ocean \r\n  Holiday Pâ€™ship, 314 S.C. 116, 124, 441 S.E.2d 835, 840 (Ct. App. 1994) (citations \r\n  omitted).Â  â€œA party seeking to set aside a judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b) has \r\n  the burden of presenting evidence entitling him to the requested relief.â€Â  Perry \r\n  v. Heirs at Law of Gadsden, 357 S.C. 42, 46-47, 590 S.E.2d 502, 504 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2003) (citing Bowers v. Bowers, 304 S.C. 65, 403 S.E.2d 127 (1991)).Â  \r\n  An abuse of discretion arises where the trial judge was controlled by an error \r\n  of law, or where her order is based on factual conclusions that are without \r\n  evidentiary support.Â  Tri-County Ice &amp; Fuel Co. v. Palmetto Ice Co., \r\n  303 S.C. 237, 242, 399 S.E.2d 779, 782 (1990). \r\nHusbandâ€™s Rule 60(b) motion does not specify \r\n  upon which of the five enumerated grounds for relief his motion is based.Â  Husband \r\n  fails to demonstrate any error of law or unsupported conclusion in the courtâ€™s \r\n  final decree.Â  Thus, he has not met his burden.Â  Further, his assertions of \r\n  error do not come within the ambit of any of the Rule 60(b)â€™s five reasons for \r\n  granting relief.Â  Accordingly, we hold the family court judge was within her \r\n  discretion in denying the Rule 60(b) motion.Â  \r\nIn his brief, Husband states that â€œ[a] \r\n  substantial portion of the Appellantâ€™s argument is based on the neglect of his \r\n  attorney.â€Â  He specifically contends: â€œAppellantâ€™s trial counsel did not present \r\n  a completed financial declaration on behalf of Appellant.Â  In addition, counsel \r\n  did not present basic information such as an inventory of the property.Â  Also, \r\n  Appellantâ€™s counsel stipulated to documents which were not accurate.Â  Finally, \r\n  counsel failed to present pertinent information relating to equitable apportionment.â€Â  \r\n\r\nInitially, we note that Husbandâ€™s Rule \r\n  60(b) motion did not raise the issue of his trial counselâ€™s performance.Â  Issues \r\n  not raised and ruled upon in the trial court will not be considered on appeal.Â  \r\n  Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505, 598 S.E.2d 712 (2004); \r\n  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 526 S.E.2d 716 (2000).Â  \r\n  Nevertheless, we find this contention meritless.Â  In Greenville Income Partners \r\n  v. Holman, 308 S.C. 105, 417 S.E.2d 107 (1992), we held the failure of an \r\n  attorney to interpose available defenses did not amount to the kind of mistake, \r\n  surprise, inadvertence, and excusable neglect contemplated by Rule 60(b).Â  Id. \r\n  at 107, 417 S.E.2d at 108.Â  â€œThe acts of an attorney are directly attributable \r\n  to and binding on his client.â€Â  Id.

Thayer Rivers, Jr., Special Referee\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-097\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2005 â€“ Filed February \r\n  9, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nDeborah Ann Malphrus, of Ridgeland, for Appellants\r\nKenneth L. Tootle, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this action to quiet title \r\n  and partition property, Beatrice Devore Bing [1]  and Theadie Mae Devore White (collectively \r\n  Appellants) appeal from the order of the special referee selling the property \r\n  to Tereather Orr.Â  We affirm. [2] \r\nFACTS\r\nAppellants were two of eleven children who inherited \r\n  two tracts of land, one approximately 8.9 acres and the other approximately \r\n  17.2 acres.Â  Appellants brought the underlying action to quiet title and partition \r\n  the property.\r\nNeil Riley, as special referee, issued an order \r\n  determining the ownership rights in the property.Â  Additionally, he found the \r\n  property should be sold and the proceeds divided.Â  The order provided for the \r\n  property to be listed with a realtor for three months for the purpose of seeking \r\n  a private sale of the property.Â  If a purchaser was not found, the property \r\n  could be sold at public auction.Â  \r\nSubsequently, R. Thayer Rivers, Jr. was \r\n  substituted as special referee.Â  The referee presided over a hearing to determine \r\n  the method of sale for the property.Â  At the hearing, he took into evidence \r\n  a bid for the 8.9-acre tract of land, letters indicating three realtors had \r\n  been unable to locate a purchaser for the other tract, letters seeking sealed \r\n  bids from individuals and entities, and an appraisal of the 17-acre tract.Â  \r\n  Â The appraisal indicated the value of the 17-acre tract was $2,700 per acre \r\n  or approximately $46,500 for the tract.Â  The hearing was continued and the time \r\n  for submitting bids was held open.Â  \r\nIn a subsequent order, the referee accepted \r\n  a bid for the 8.9 acres filed by one of the heirs. [3] Â  Additionally, the referee accepted \r\n  a bid by Orr for the purchase of the 17-acre tract for $26,500.Â  The referee \r\n  specifically found:Â  â€œIn determining whether these bids were reasonable, I considered \r\n  the appraisal of the subject properties which was introduced into evidence . \r\n  . . the Jasper Countyâ€™s Tax Assessorâ€™s assessed value . . . [and] the sales \r\n  price of several other tracts of land of comparable value in the general vicinity \r\n  of the subject properties.â€Â  The referee found Orrâ€™s bid was â€œfair, just \r\n  and equitable,â€ and set forth the specifics of the private sale of both tracts \r\n  of land. This appeal follows the denial of Appellantsâ€™ motion to reconsider. \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œA partition action is an equitable action, \r\n  heard by a judge alone and, as such, this Court on review may find facts in \r\n  accordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Anderson \r\n  v. Anderson, 299 S.C. 110, 113, 382 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1989).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants contend the referee erred in \r\n  directing a private sale of the property and in finding the bid was fair and \r\n  reasonable.Â  We disagree.\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Private vs. Public Sale\r\nPursuant to South Carolina statute:\r\n\r\nThe court of common pleas has jurisdiction in all cases of \r\n  real and personal estates held in joint tenancy or in common to make partition \r\n  in kind . . . or, in case partition in kind or by allotment cannot be fairly \r\n  and impartially made and without injury to any of the parties in interest, by \r\n  the sale of the property and the division of the proceeds according to the rights \r\n  of the parties.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-61-50 (1977).\r\n First, we must address whether the issue \r\n  of requiring sale by public auction has been preserved for review on appeal.Â  \r\n  In their motion for reconsideration, Appellants argued there was â€œno evidence \r\n  in the record supporting a finding that the sales price of $26,500.00 is a fair \r\n  and equitable sales price.â€ The motion further stated that â€œ[t]he Plaintiffs \r\n  are informed and believe that the (17.22) acre tract of land . . . should be \r\n  sold at public auction by the Jasper County Clerk of Court.â€Â  While requesting \r\n  sale by public auction, the motion does not specifically raise the issue of \r\n  whether the referee erred â€œin ordering a private sale to an individual who was \r\n  not an heir without the express consent of the plaintiffs and other heirs owning \r\n  an interest in the propertyâ€ as raised in Appellantsâ€™ brief.Â  Accordingly, the \r\n  issue is not preserved for review on appeal by this court.Â  See Wilder \r\n  Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic \r\n  that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been \r\n  raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).\r\nThe issue fails on the merits as well.Â  Appellants \r\n  sought the sale of the property without specifying the method.Â  Appellants did \r\n  not appeal the order of the referee on the issue of holding open the time for \r\n  receipt of private bids.Â  In addition, Appellants specifically solicited private \r\n  bids from several individuals. \r\nAppellants cannot now complain of the method used \r\n  by the court to sell the property when they consented to the method and even \r\n  sought to take advantage of it by soliciting private bids from parties who were \r\n  not heirs.Â  Orr filed the bid in accordance with the method and within the time \r\n  allotted by the referee.Â  Accordingly, we find the referee properly allowed \r\n  the property to be sold in a private sale as opposed to requiring a public auction.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Amount of Bid\r\nAppellantsâ€™ main contention appears to be that \r\n  the value received for the property was far below the appraised value, and therefore, \r\n  the referee was without evidentiary support in finding the bid was fair and \r\n  equitable.Â  We disagree.\r\nAppellants cite Pruitt v. Pruitt, 298 S.C. \r\n  411, 414-15, 380 S.E.2d 862, 864 (Ct. App. 1989), for the contention that where \r\n  there is disparate testimony regarding the value of the property, partition \r\n  by public sale is appropriate.Â  However, the trial court in Pruitt apportioned \r\n  the property to one of the parties.Â  Id.Â  In the case sub judice, \r\n  the property was sold to a private bidder after numerous bids were solicited \r\n  and no other bid was received.Â  We find the holding in Pruitt to be inapposite \r\n  to the instant case.\r\nWhile the appraisal of the property is evidence \r\n  of the value of the 17-acre tract, it is not the only evidence present in the \r\n  record, nor must the court find a bid unreasonable if it is below the appraised \r\n  value.Â  See Freeman v. Freeman, 323 S.C. 95, 105-06, 473 S.E.2d \r\n  467, 474 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The record also indicates, and the referee specifically \r\n  noted the fact Appellants contacted individuals soliciting bids on the property \r\n  without receiving a single response.Â  \r\nAdditionally, the referee specifically stated he \r\n  considered the appraisal, the value of land in the area, and the tax assessed \r\n  value of the property.Â  Even though we have authority to find all facts with \r\n  our own view of the preponderance of the evidence, we are not required to ignore \r\n  the findings of the referee.Â  Id. at 98, 473 S.E.2d at 469-70.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we find there is evidence in the record indicating the sole bid received for \r\n  the property was a fair and reasonable amount for the property and the referee \r\n  did not err in ordering the private sale to Orr.\r\nAFFIRMED.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nANDERSON, STILWELL, and SHORT JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Beatrice Devore Bing passed away during the proceedings and her interest \r\n    in the property transferred to her children. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  The sale and amount received for the 8.9-acre tract are not subject \r\n    to this appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-098","title":"United of Omaha v.

Cowart.Â  According \r\n  to the policy terms, the owner of the policy is â€œ(a) the Insured or, (b) the \r\n  applicant if a person other than the Insured applied for this policy, or (c) \r\n  the assignee of record in the case of an assignment of ownership.â€Â  On the application \r\n  for the policy, Cowart, Williamâ€™s wife, is listed as the primary beneficiary, \r\n  and the word â€œownerâ€ is handwritten next to her name. \r\n  [2] Â  Other than this handwritten notation, no evidence suggests William \r\n  ever assigned ownership of the policy.Â  \r\nAfter William became ill in November 2001, Cowart \r\n  moved out of the marital home and William moved in with his sister, Elaine Helms.Â  \r\n  Thereafter, William submitted a change of beneficiary form to United of Omaha \r\n  and designated Helms as the primary beneficiary.Â  United of Omaha in turn issued \r\n  a beneficiary endorsement effective January 5, 2002.Â  \r\nAfter William died on \r\n  March 24, 2002, both Cowart and Helms submitted claims for the proceeds of the \r\n  policy.Â  In April 2002, Cowart made a written request to United of Omaha, asking \r\n  it not to pay the proceeds until a court could determine the matter.Â  Because \r\n  United of Omaha could only pay one beneficiary, it filed an interpleader action, \r\n  pursuant to Rule 22, SCRCP.Â  Cowart answered and counterclaimed against United \r\n  of Omaha, alleging breach of contract and bad faith for failure to pay the proceeds \r\n  to her.Â  Cowart also cross-claimed against Helms, alleging undue influence.Â Â  \r\n\r\nCowart filed a motion for summary judgment \r\n  as to her counterclaims.Â  United of Omaha moved to deposit the funds with the \r\n  clerk of court, to be dismissed from the case, and to dismiss Cowartâ€™s counterclaims.Â  \r\n  The court denied Cowartâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  The court determined \r\n  that United of Omaha was entitled to deposit the policy proceeds with the clerk \r\n  of court and to be relieved from liability pursuant to Rule 22, SCRCP.Â  The \r\n  court further found that United of Omaha was entitled to summary judgment as \r\n  to Cowartâ€™s breach of contract and bad faith counterclaims.Â  Cowart appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Interpleader\r\nCowart argues the trial court \r\n  erred in granting interpleader to United of Omaha because United of Omaha was \r\n  not a neutral stakeholder.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn an appeal from a grant of \r\n  interpleader, this court examines whether the evidence before the trial court \r\n  was sufficient to support its grant of interpleader.Â  First Union Natâ€™l Bank \r\n  of South Carolina v. FCVS Communications, 321 S.C. 496, 499, 469 S.E.2d \r\n  613, 616 (Ct. App. 1997), revâ€™d in part, 328 S.C. 290, 494 S.E.2d 429 \r\n  (1997) (dismissing as moot the writ of certiorari as to interpleader).Â  When \r\n  claims are such that a plaintiff is or may be exposed to double or multiple \r\n  liability, the claimaints may be joined as defendants and required to interplead.Â  \r\n  Rule 22(a), SCRCP.Â  â€œâ€˜The historical and still the primary purpose of interpleader \r\n  is to enable a neutral stakeholder, usually an insurance company or a bank, \r\n  to shield itself from liability for paying over the stake to the wrong party.â€™â€Â  \r\n  FCVS Communications, 321 S.C. at 499, 469 S.E.2d at 616 (quoting Indianapolis \r\n  Colts v. Mayor of Baltimore, 733 F.2d 484, 486 (7th Cir. 1984)).Â  Only the \r\n  potential for multiple claims is needed.Â  Id. at 499, 469 S.E.2d at 616.\r\nIn FCVS Communications, \r\n  First Union National Bank held the account for the partnership FCVS Communications.Â  \r\n  When it became unclear who had the authority to transact business on the account, \r\n  the bank filed an interpleader action against the partnership and individual \r\n  partners in order to clarify the competing claims.Â  This court upheld the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s grant of interpleader in light of the conflicting claims to the funds.Â  \r\n  FCVS Communications, 321 S.C. at 501, 469 S.E.2d at 617.Â  \r\nCowart argues that, unlike the \r\n  bank in FCVS Communications, United of Omaha is not a â€œneutral stakeholderâ€ \r\n  because it is trying to shield itself from liability due to its actions in changing \r\n  the beneficiary.Â  Thus, she argues, its actions do not fit within the purpose \r\n  of Rule 22, SCRCP. \r\nWe find that United of Omaha, \r\n  like the bank in FCVS Communications, faced competing claims to the insurance \r\n  proceeds, thus exposing itself to double liability.Â  Here, both claims are arguably \r\n  valid. Â This alone justifies an action for interpleader.Â  Rule 22(a), SCRCP \r\n  (â€œPersons having claims against the plaintiff may be joined as defendants and \r\n  required to interplead when their claims are such that the plaintiff is or may \r\n  be exposed to double or multiple liability.â€).Â  Further, we conclude there is \r\n  no evidence that United of Omaha was not a â€œneutral stakeholder.â€Â  United of \r\n  Omaha sought to pay the proceeds due under the policy, despite Cowartâ€™s allegation \r\n  that United of Omaha inappropriately changed the beneficiary in this case.Â  \r\n  Whether or not the beneficiary was appropriately changed has no effect on United \r\n  of Omahaâ€™s duty to pay; it merely affects to whom the proceeds are paid.Â  Thus, \r\n  United of Omaha was sufficiently neutral. \r\nTo further support her argument, \r\n  Cowart cites to Citizens Bank of Forsyth v. Middlebrooks, 72 S.E.2d 298 \r\n  (Ga. 1952), in which the Georgia Supreme Court denied an institutionâ€™s action \r\n  for interpleader.Â  The Middlebrooks court found that a stakeholder was \r\n  not entitled to interpleader because the stakeholder was in possession of all \r\n  the facts and there was no reasonably debatable question of law.Â  Id. \r\n  at 332.Â  This case is not helpful to Cowart, however, because here, the question \r\n  of the owner of the policy as well as the appropriate beneficiary is indeed \r\n  a question of law that is reasonably debatable.Â  Thus, even pursuant to Middlebrooks, \r\n  the grant of interpleader in the present case was appropriate.\r\nBecause the evidence presented \r\n  to the trial court was sufficient to demonstrate United of Omaha was exposed \r\n  to multiple liability consistent with Rule 22, SCRCP, and South Carolina case \r\n  law, we find no error in its decision to grant interpleader.\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nGrant of Summary Judgment as to Cowartâ€™s Counterclaims \r\n   \r\nCowart argues the trial court \r\n  erred in granting summary judgment in favor of United of Omaha on her bad faith \r\n  and breach of contract claims because United of Omahaâ€™s motion was made under \r\n  Rules 12 and 22, SCRCP.Â  She argues the trial court was precluded from granting \r\n  a motion for summary judgment because she was never given notice.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn reviewing the grant of a \r\n  summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard that \r\n  governs the trial court under Rule 56, SCRCP.Â  Nexsen v. Haddock, 353 \r\n  S.C. 74, 77, 576 S.E.2d 183, 185 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Summary judgment is appropriate \r\n  when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled \r\n  to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  Id.Â  In ruling on a motion for summary \r\n  judgment, the evidence and the inferences that can be drawn therefrom should \r\n  be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  George v. \r\n  Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).Â  \r\nIf a court considers matters \r\n  outside the pleadings when deciding on a motion to dismiss, the motion will \r\n  be treated as one for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56, SCRCP, provided \r\n  the parties are given the requisite notice and opportunity to present outside \r\n  materials pertinent to a Rule 56, SCRCP, motion.Â  Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP; Johnson \r\n  v. Dailey, 318 S.C. 318, 321, 457 S.E.2d 613, 615 (1995).Â  \r\nIn its December 16, 2002 reply \r\n  to Cowartâ€™s counterclaims, United of Omaha moved to dismiss the counterclaims \r\n  generally pursuant to Rules 12 and 22, SCRCP.Â  On the same date, United of Omaha \r\n  filed a motion to be relieved from liability and moved to have the bad faith \r\n  counterclaim dismissed pursuant to Rule 12, SCRCP.Â  Nearly a year later, in \r\n  November 2003, Cowart filed a separate motion for summary judgment as to her \r\n  counterclaims, she submitted an affidavit, and a hearing was held on all the \r\n  motions.Â  United of Omaha filed the November 11, 2003 affidavit of Tom Groves, \r\n  with supporting exhibits, prior to the hearing, and it was submitted to the \r\n  trial court without objection.Â  \r\nCowart claims that \r\n  she did not have the requisite notice that the trial court intended to transform \r\n  United of Omahaâ€™s motions to dismiss into motions for summary judgment until \r\n  she received the courtâ€™s order.Â  Although notice pursuant to Rule 56, SCRCP, \r\n  must be given when a trial court converts a motion to dismiss into one for summary \r\n  judgment, Cowart did not move before the trial court for reconsideration based \r\n  upon her lack of notice.Â  Because she did not complain about the conversion \r\n  and the lack of notice to the trial court, thus denying the court the opportunity \r\n  to rule upon the matter, her issue is not preserved for our review.Â  See \r\n  Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 \r\n  (2000) (holding that matters not raised to and ruled upon by the trial court \r\n  are not preserved for appellate review); In re Estate of Timmerman, 331 \r\n  S.C. 455, 460, 502 S.E.2d 920, 922 (Ct. App. 1998) (holding that when a party \r\n  receives an order granting certain relief not previously contemplated or presented \r\n  to the trial court, the aggrieved party must move pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, \r\n  to alter or amend the judgment in order to preserve the issue for appellate \r\n  review).Â  Further, Cowart was not caught by surprise at the hearing because \r\n  she was able to present outside materials at the hearing in support of her own \r\n  motion for summary judgment.Â  \r\nBecause Cowart failed to complain \r\n  to the trial court that conversion was improper and she was nevertheless able \r\n  to present her own materials, this issue has no merit. \r\n  [3] \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial court did \r\n  not err in granting United of Omahaâ€™s motion for interpleader.Â  Cowartâ€™s issue \r\n  regarding the conversion of the motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment \r\n  is not preserved for appellate review.Â  Further, the denial of Cowartâ€™s motion \r\n  for summary judgment is not appealable.Â  Accordingly, the order of the trial \r\n  court is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues \r\n    on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, \r\n    SCACR.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The policy itself refers to the application or endorsement for beneficiary \r\n    information. Â \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Cowart also argues that the trial court erred in denying her motion \r\n    for summary judgment as to her contract counterclaim.Â  It is well-settled \r\n    that the denial of a motion for summary judgment is not appealable.Â  Olson \r\n    v. Faculty House of Carolina, Inc., 354 S.C. 161, 168, 580 S.E.2d 440, \r\n    444 (2003).Â  Thus, we decline to address Cowartâ€™s argument on this issue.\r\n  &nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-099","title":"State v.

Floyd, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-099\r\nSubmitted February 1, 2005 â€“ Filed February \r\n  10, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nActing Chief Attorney Joseph L. Savitz III, of Columbia; \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, \r\n  all of Columbia; and Solicitor Warren Blair Giese, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Bobby Joe Reeves appeals his \r\n  conviction for first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor.Â  He contends \r\n  the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to convict him of this \r\n  offense because the indictment did not identify the victim by name and did not \r\n  state the offense with sufficient certainty and particularity.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1990, when the victim was eight months \r\n  old, her mother met Reeves through a mutual friend.Â  For financial reasons, \r\n  the victim and her mother moved in with Reeves.Â  During this time, the victim \r\n  became attached to Reeves and viewed him as a father figure.Â  Reeves moved out \r\n  of the home when the victim was five years old.Â  Despite the move, Reeves maintained \r\n  contact with the victim and her mother.Â  The victim had overnight visits with \r\n  Reeves almost every other weekend. \r\nIn 1998, the victim and her mother moved \r\n  to Georgia.Â  Reeves continued to maintain a relationship with the victim \r\n  until July 4, 2000.Â  According to the victimâ€™s mother, the victim began to act \r\n  â€œunusualâ€ after the July 4th weekend.Â  Toward the latter part of July 2000, \r\n  Reeves contacted the victimâ€™s mother to schedule a visit with the victim.Â  When \r\n  the victim refused to go to Reevesâ€™ home, the victimâ€™s mother questioned her \r\n  about her decision.Â  The victim told her mother that Reeves had sexually abused \r\n  her on several occasions during her visits.\r\nImmediately after this conversation, \r\n  the victimâ€™s mother contacted law enforcement in Augusta, Georgia.Â  On July \r\n  31, 2000, the case was referred to the Richland County Sheriffâ€™s Department.Â  \r\n  Ultimately, a Richland County grand jury indicted Reeves for one count of lewd \r\n  act upon a child and first-degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC) with a minor.Â  \r\n  A jury convicted Reeves of both charges and the trial judge imposed concurrent, \r\n  fifteen-year sentences.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nFor the first time on appeal, Reeves challenges his \r\n  conviction for first-degree CSC with a minor on the ground the indictment was \r\n  invalid. [2] Â  Specifically, he \r\n  contends the trial court was divested of subject matter jurisdiction to convict \r\n  him of this offense because the indictment did not identify the victim by name \r\n  and did not state the offense with sufficient certainty and particularity.Â  \r\n  Based on these alleged deficiencies, Reeves characterizes the indictment as \r\n  â€œincomprehensible.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nIssues relating to subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  may be raised at any time.Â  Browning v. State, 320 S.C. 366, 368, 465 \r\n  S.E.2d 358, 359 (1995).Â  A circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction if:Â  \r\n  (1) there has been an indictment that sufficiently states the offense; (2) there \r\n  has been a waiver of indictment; or (3) the charge is a lesser-included charge \r\n  of the crime charged in the indictment.Â  Id.; see Brown v. \r\n  State, 343 S.C. 342, 346, 540 S.E.2d 846, 849 (2001) (stating acts of a \r\n  court with respect to a matter to which it has no subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  are void).Â  \r\nSouth Carolina appellate courts have held \r\n  the sufficiency of an indictment â€œmust be viewed with a practical eye; all the \r\n  surrounding circumstances must be weighed before an accurate determination of \r\n  whether a defendant was or was not prejudiced can be reached.â€ State v. Adams, \r\n  277 S.C. 115, 125, 283 S.E.2d 582, 588 (1981), overruled on other grounds \r\n  by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).\r\nAn indictment is sufficient if it contains the necessary \r\n  elements of the offense intended to be charged and sufficiently apprises the \r\n  defendant of what he must be prepared to meet.Â  Browning, 320 S.C. at \r\n  368, 465 S.E.2d at 359; State v. Gill, 355 S.C. 234, 238, 584 S.E.2d \r\n  432, 434 (Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied (Sept. 23, 2004).Â  â€œFurther, an \r\n  indictment is sufficient if the offense is stated with sufficient certainty \r\n  and particularity to enable the court to know what judgment to pronounce, and \r\n  the defendant to know what he is called upon to answer and whether he may plead \r\n  an acquittal or conviction thereon.â€ State v. Curtis, 356 S.C. 622, 628-29, \r\n  591 S.E.2d 600, 603 (2004).Â  â€œAn indictment phrased substantially in language \r\n  of a statute which creates and defines the offense is ordinarily sufficient.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 628, 591 S.E.2d at 603; see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-20 (2003) \r\n  (â€œEvery indictment shall be deemed and judged sufficient and good in law which, \r\n  in addition to allegations as to time and place, as required by law, charges \r\n  the crime substantially in the language of the common law or of the statute \r\n  prohibiting the crime or so plainly that the nature of the offense charged may \r\n  be easily understood and, if the offense be a statutory offense, that the offense \r\n  be alleged to be contrary to the statute in such case made and provided.â€).\r\nIn the instant case, the indictment for first-degree \r\n  CSC with a minor provided:\r\n\r\nThat Bobby Joe Reeves did in Richland County between June \r\n  30 and July 4, 2000, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously commit a sexual battery \r\n  to wit:Â  sexual intercourse and/or fellatio and/or any intrusion, however slight, \r\n  of any part of a personâ€™s body or of any object into the genital and/or anal \r\n  opening of a personâ€™s body, except when such intrusion is accomplished for medically \r\n  recognized treatment or diagnostic purposes, who at the time was less than 11 \r\n  years of age.Â  All in violation of SC Code of Laws Â§ 16-3-655.\r\n\r\nâ€œA person is guilty of criminal sexual \r\n  conduct in the first degree if the actor engages in sexual battery with the \r\n  victim who is less than eleven years of age.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-655 (1) \r\n  (2003).Â  A â€˜[s]exual batteryâ€™ means sexual intercourse, cunnilingus, fellatio, \r\n  anal intercourse, or any intrusion, however slight, of any part of a personâ€™s \r\n  body or of any object into the genital or anal openings of another personâ€™s \r\n  body, except when such intrusion is accomplished for medically recognized treatment \r\n  or diagnostic purposes.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-651(h) (2003). \r\nIn terms of Reevesâ€™ complaint concerning \r\n  the Stateâ€™s failure to identify the victim by name, we find this omission did \r\n  not invalidate the indictment.Â  In several cases, this court and our supreme \r\n  court have found amendments that corrected the names of victims did not change \r\n  the nature of the charged offense, and, thus, did not deprive the circuit court \r\n  of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  See State v. Sweat, 221 S.C. \r\n  270, 273-74, 70 S.E.2d 234, 235-36 (1952) (holding nature of offense of larceny \r\n  was not changed when State amended indictment to change the name of the victim); \r\n  State v. Oâ€™Neal, 210 S.C. 305, 309, 42 S.E.2d 523, 524-25 (1947) (finding \r\n  amendment to indictment to correct name of defendant did not change the nature \r\n  of the offense charged); State v. McGill, 191 S.C. 1, 4-5, 3 S.E.2d 257, \r\n  258-59 (1939) (finding issues regarding the victimâ€™s name in an indictment do \r\n  not involve the circuit courtâ€™s jurisdiction); State v. Barnett, 358 \r\n  S.C. 199, 201 n.1, 594 S.E.2d 534, 535 n.1 (Ct. App. 2004) (holding, in case \r\n  involving charge of grand larceny of a vehicle, amendment to name of owner of \r\n  the vehicle was not a jurisdictional flaw); State v. Johnson, 314 S.C. \r\n  161, 166, 442 S.E.2d 191, 194 (Ct. App. 1994) (holding amendment to substitute \r\n  the Corporation for the Foundation involved in charge of breach of trust with \r\n  fraudulent intent did not deprive the circuit court of subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  where â€œnature of the crime charged in the original indictments was not changed \r\n  by the substitution of the victim in the amended indictmentsâ€); cf. State \r\n  v. Bryson, 357 S.C. 106, 112, 591 S.E.2d 637, 640 (Ct. App. 2003) (concluding \r\n  amendment to replace name of one victim with another involved in charge of assaulting \r\n  an officer while resisting arrest divested the circuit court of subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction given the â€œamendment replaced the properly indicted count of assaulting \r\n  an officer while resisting arrest with a second unindicted count of the same \r\n  crimeâ€).\r\nAlthough this case involved the omission \r\n  of the victimâ€™s name and not an amendment, we find the principles outlined in \r\n  the above-cited cases are applicable.Â  Moreover, we believe our supreme courtâ€™s \r\n  decision in Thompson v. State, 357 S.C. 192, 593 S.E.2d 139 (2004), is \r\n  dispositive of this issue.Â  In Thompson, the defendant pleaded guilty \r\n  to murder, armed robbery, and two counts of criminal conspiracy.Â  Several years \r\n  after the plea, Thompson petitioned our supreme court for a writ of certiorari \r\n  alleging for the first time that the trial court was without subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction because the indictments charging him with criminal conspiracy were \r\n  insufficient.Â  One of the grounds raised by Thompson was the fact that the indictments \r\n  did not identify the victim and the co-conspirator and did not specify facts \r\n  upon which the charges were based.Â  Our supreme court rejected this contention, \r\n  finding â€œthe alleged defects regarding the victimâ€™s name, the co-conspiratorâ€™s \r\n  identity, and the particular details of the conspiracy are defects that are \r\n  facially apparent and do not involve the elements of the offense.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 196, 593 S.E.2d at 141.Â  \r\nApplying Thompson to the instant \r\n  case, we hold the Stateâ€™s failure to identify the victim by name did not constitute \r\n  a jurisdictional defect. [3] Â  \r\n  Given this holding, we find it was incumbent upon Reeves to raise this challenge \r\n  prior to trial.Â  \r\nFurthermore, viewing the indictment â€œwith \r\n  a practical eye,â€ we hold it stated the offense of first-degree CSC with a minor \r\n  with sufficient certainty and particularity to enable the trial court and Reeves \r\n  to know what crime was alleged.Â  Both the caption of the indictment and title \r\n  preceding the body of the indictment identified the charged offense as first-degree \r\n  criminal sexual conduct with a minor.Â  Additionally, the body of the indictment \r\n  identified the applicable statute, described the alleged sexual battery in terms \r\n  of the statute, and identified the age of the victim as less than eleven years \r\n  old.\r\nIn support of his \r\n  argument, Reeves directs our attention to this courtâ€™s decision in State \r\n  v. Ellison, 356 S.C. 33, 586 S.E.2d 596 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  We find, however, \r\n  that Ellison is distinguishable from the instant case.Â  In Ellison, \r\n  the defendant was indicted pursuant to an allegation that he sexually assaulted \r\n  a thirteen-year-old girl.Â  The caption of the indictment and the title preceding \r\n  the body of the indictment identified the offense as first-degree CSC with a \r\n  minor.Â  The body of the indictment stated the victim was thirteen years old \r\n  and the sexual battery was committed using aggravated force and aggravated coercion.Â  \r\n  Id. at 35, 586 S.E.2d at 597.Â  At the beginning of the trial, the State \r\n  moved, without objection, to amend the indictment to charge the defendant with \r\n  first-degree CSC.Â  The trial court instructed the jury on the offense of first-degree \r\n  CSC and, on its own initiative, charged the jury on second-degree CSC with a \r\n  minor as a lesser-included offense.Â  Id. at 36, 586 S.E.2d at 597.Â  The \r\n  jury convicted the defendant of second-degree CSC with a minor.Â  \r\nOn appeal, this court vacated \r\n  the defendantâ€™s conviction, finding the trial court was without subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction to convict the defendant of this offense.Â  Specifically, the court \r\n  found:Â  1). second-degree CSC with a minor was not a lesser-included offense \r\n  of first-degree CSC; and 2). the original indictment did not sufficiently state \r\n  the offense for which the defendant was indicted.Â  Regarding the insufficiency \r\n  of the indictment language, we concluded:Â  1). the body of the indictment contained \r\n  allegations for second-degree CSC with a minor, first-degree CSC, and second-degree \r\n  CSC; and 2). the caption and title of the indictment alleged the crime of first-degree \r\n  CSC with a minor.Â  Id. at 38, 586 S.E.2d at 598.Â Â  Based on these discrepancies, \r\n  we held the indictment was unclear as to what judgment the court could pronounce \r\n  and sentence it could impose.Â  Id. at 38, 586 S.E.2d at 598. \r\nUnlike Ellison, the \r\n  indictment in the instant case clearly alleged in the caption, title, and body \r\n  that Reeves was being charged only with first-degree CSC with a minor.Â Â Â  \r\nFinally, to the extent Reeves characterizes \r\n  the indictment as â€œincomprehensible,â€ we also find this argument to be without \r\n  merit.Â  Because the sexual battery described in the indictment merely tracked \r\n  the language of the definitional statute, Reeves contends he was not apprised \r\n  of what he was called upon to answer.Â  Initially, we note the fact that indictment \r\n  used the statutory language weighs in favor of finding the indictment sufficient \r\n  given it â€œcharges the crime substantially in the language . . . of the statute \r\n  prohibiting the crime.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-20 (2003).Â  Furthermore, the \r\n  victim alleged Reeves forced her to perform oral sex and digitally penetrated \r\n  her on one occasion.Â  Thus, the victimâ€™s allegations involved different types \r\n  of sexual battery that are encompassed in the language of the indictment.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the \r\n  circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction to convict Reeves of first-degree \r\n  CSC with a minor.Â  Accordingly, Reevesâ€™ convictions and sentences for first-degree \r\n  CSC with a minor and lewd act upon a minor are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the \r\n    issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule \r\n    215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  We note Reeves does not appeal his conviction and sentence for lewd \r\n    act upon a minor.Â  Because he received a concurrent, fifteen-year term of \r\n    imprisonment, we need not address his issue on appeal.Â  However, given this \r\n    issue involves questions of subject matter jurisdiction, we decline to apply \r\n    the â€œconcurrent sentence doctrine.â€Â  State v. Ervin, 333 S.C. 351, \r\n    359, 510 S.E.2d 220, 225 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Â Â  We would also point out that the victim was identified by name \r\n    in the indictment for lewd act upon a minor, the victim testified during an \r\n    in camera hearing prior to the trial, and the trial judge identified the victim \r\n    by name during jury selection. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-100","title":"State v.

Fairey and O. Doyle Martin, both of Greenville \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this divorce case, Shelden \r\n  K. Waters (Husband) appeals from the family courtâ€™s order requiring him to pay \r\n  child support past his minor childâ€™s age of majority, imputing income to him \r\n  under the child support guidelines, equitably dividing marital debt, and awarding \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees to Rebecca J. Waters (Wife).Â  We affirm in part and reverse \r\n  in part and remand.1Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were married for twenty-nine \r\n  years.Â  The couple lived in Michigan during the first part of their marriage.Â  \r\n  Husband worked at the same job for eighteen years and was the primary wage earner.Â  \r\n  Wife stayed home and cared for the coupleâ€™s four children.Â  Tragically, the \r\n  coupleâ€™s daughter, Olivia, died in the collapse of a stroller when she was five \r\n  years old.Â  A lawsuit followed with a judgment of $335,000.Â  The parties used \r\n  part of the money to set up a trust fund of $30,000 each for their remaining \r\n  three children of whom Adam was the youngest child with the provision the funds \r\n  would be available at age eighteen.Â  Following the accident, Husband was extremely \r\n  depressed.Â  Wife convinced Husband to move to South Carolina despite his reservations \r\n  about finding commensurate employment.Â  Husband had difficulty obtaining employment \r\n  at the same pay level he enjoyed in Michigan and although both parties had difficulty \r\n  dealing with the death of their daughter, Husband continued to support the family \r\n  after moving to South Carolina.Â  \r\nDespite their attempt to â€œstart over,â€ \r\n  Husband and Wife continued to experience marital difficulties after moving.Â  \r\n  The couple eventually separated and Wife filed for divorce on the ground of \r\n  physical cruelty and sought custody, child support, equitable apportionment \r\n  of the marital property, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Following the separation, Adam, \r\n  the partiesâ€™ only minor child, experienced significant problems.Â  Adam was arrested \r\n  several times, assaulted his mother, and was hospitalized following an overdose \r\n  of alcohol and medication.Â  At the time of the trial, Adam was seventeen years \r\n  old and not currently enrolled in high school.Â  Wife testified she â€œhopedâ€ Adam \r\n  would complete his education and she had â€œmade arrangementsâ€ for Adam to attend \r\n  adult education classes.Â  Wife asserted she would only consent to Adam remaining \r\n  in her home if he was in school and working.Â  \r\nNotwithstanding Adamâ€™s behavioral difficulties, \r\n  Wife sought custody of him.Â  Additionally, she sought an increase of child support \r\n  and continuation of child support for one year after Adam reached majority to \r\n  allow him to complete his education.Â  At the time of the hearing, Wife was employed \r\n  as a bookkeeper and earned $43,548 annually.Â  Although Wife testified Husband \r\n  was a â€œvery hard workerâ€ and supported the family throughout the marriage, Husband \r\n  lost his job due to layoffs shortly before the final hearing.Â  Husband had earned \r\n  more than $42,000 per year and was actively seeking employment, but his only \r\n  income at the time of the hearing was unemployment compensation at the rate \r\n  of $1,204 per month.Â  Because Husband was not employed at his full earning potential, \r\n  Wife sought to impute income to Husband to increase his support obligation under \r\n  the child support guidelines.Â  \r\nBy order dated April 22, 2002, the family \r\n  court granted the parties a divorce based upon one yearâ€™s continuous separation.Â  \r\n  Although insufficient to support a finding of physical cruelty as the ground \r\n  for divorce, the family court also found there was a history of emotional, verbal \r\n  and physical abuse by Husband.Â  The family court found Husbandâ€™s underemployment \r\n  was voluntary and imputed income to him in the amount of $10.00 per hour.Â  Husband \r\n  was ordered to pay child support until Adam graduated from high school or reached \r\n  age nineteen.Â  The family court apportioned the marital estate equally between \r\n  the parties.Â  Although disputed by Husband, the family court found Wifeâ€™s credit \r\n  card debt was incurred for the benefit of both parties and their children.Â  \r\n  Therefore, the marital estate included the credit card debt.Â  The family court \r\n  also ordered Husband to pay $10,000 of Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  Husband \r\n  appeals.Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family court, this court has \r\n  the authority to find the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence. Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, \r\n  414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992). We are not, however, required to disregard the findings \r\n  of the family court, which saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position \r\n  to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony. \r\n  Haselden v. Haselden, 347 S.C. 48, 58, 552 S.E.2d 329, 334 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001); Wilson v. Walker, 340 S.C. 531, 537, 532 S.E.2d 19, \r\n  22 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\n\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Child Support\r\nHusband argues the family court erred \r\n  by ordering him to pay child support past Adamâ€™s age of majority.Â  Specifically, \r\n  Husband asserts the evidence was insufficient to allow post-majority support \r\n  because Adam was not making any attempt to complete high school at the time \r\n  of the final hearing.Â  We agree.\r\nThe family court has authority: \r\n\r\nTo make all orders for support run until further order of \r\n  the court, except that orders for child support run until the child is eighteen \r\n  years of age or until the child is married or becomes self&#8209;supporting, \r\n  as determined by the court, whichever occurs first or to provide for child support \r\n  past the age of eighteen years if the child is in high school and is making \r\n  satisfactory progress toward completion of high school, not to exceed the nineteenth \r\n  birthday unless exceptional circumstances are found to exist or unless there \r\n  is a preexisting agreement or order to provide for child support past the age \r\n  of eighteen years; and in the discretion of the court, to provide for child \r\n  support past age eighteen where there are physical or mental disabilities of \r\n  the child or other exceptional circumstances that warrant the continuation of \r\n  child support beyond age eighteen for as long as the physical or mental disabilities \r\n  or exceptional circumstances continue. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(17) (Supp.2004).Â  In addition, child support awards \r\n  are addressed to the sound discretion of the family court and, absent an abuse \r\n  of discretion, will not be disturbed on appeal.Â  Mitchell v. Mitchell, \r\n  283 S.C. 87, 92, 320 S.E.2d 706, 710 (1984). Abuse of discretion occurs when \r\n  the court is controlled by an error of law, or where the order, based upon findings \r\n  of fact, has no evidentiary support.Â  Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, \r\n  485, 477 S.E.2d 727, 729 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nIn the instant case, the family court ordered Husband to pay child \r\n  support for Adam â€œuntil he graduates from high school or reaches the age of \r\n  nineteen, whichever occurs first.â€Â  No evidence suggests Adam was â€œmaking satisfactory \r\n  progress toward completion of high schoolâ€ as required by section 20-7-420(17).Â  \r\n  Adam spent little time in Wifeâ€™s home and Wifeâ€™s testimony was speculative at \r\n  best.Â  Wife offered no direct evidence Adam was attending high school; she only \r\n  expressed her â€œhopeâ€ Adam would complete high school and asserted she was â€œmaking \r\n  arrangementsâ€ for him to attend adult education.Â  In addition to revealing Adam \r\n  was not complying with the statuteâ€™s mandate, the record clearly reveals the \r\n  parties provided Adam with his own resources to help offset school expenses.Â  \r\n  Upon reaching age eighteen, Adam would become entitled to the corpus of his \r\n  $30,000 trust fund.Â  Therefore, we find the family court erred in ordering Husband \r\n  to continue paying child support past Adamâ€™s age of majority.Â  \r\n2.Â  Imputation of Income\r\nHusband next argues the \r\n  family court erred in its calculation of child support under the South Carolina \r\n  child support guidelines.Â  Husband asserts the family court incorrectly imputed \r\n  $10 per hour to him without sufficient evidence Husbandâ€™s failure to reach his \r\n  full earning potential was voluntary.Â  We agree.\r\nUnder the child support \r\n  guidelines, income is defined as â€œactual gross income of the parent, if employed \r\n  to full capacity, or potential income if unemployed or underemployed.â€Â  27 S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A) (Supp. 2004).Â  Regarding the imputation of income, \r\n  the guidelines provide:Â  \r\n\r\nIf the court finds that a parent is voluntarily unemployed \r\n  or underemployed, it should calculate child support based on a determination \r\n  of potential income which would otherwise ordinarily be available to the parent. \r\n  . . .\r\n(b) In order to impute income to a parent who is unemployed \r\n  or underemployed, the court should determine the employment potential and probable \r\n  earnings level of the parent based on that parentâ€™s recent work history, occupational \r\n  qualifications, and prevailing job opportunities and earning levels in the community.\r\n\r\n27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs 114-4720(A)(5) (Supp. 2004).Â  Additionally, \r\n  â€œ[w]hen the court orders a child support award that varies significantly from \r\n  the amount resulting from the application of the guidelines, the court shall \r\n  make specific, written findings of those facts upon which it bases its conclusion \r\n  supporting that award.â€Â  27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs 114-4710(A)(1) (Supp. 2004).Â  \r\n  â€œThe failure to reach earning capacity by itself, does not automatically equate \r\n  to voluntary underemployment such that income must be imputed.â€Â  Kelley v. \r\n  Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, 488-89, 477 S.E.2d 727, 731 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Instead, \r\n  when actual income versus earning capacity is at issue, the court should closely \r\n  examine the payorâ€™s good faith and reasonable explanation for the decreased \r\n  income.Â  Id. at 489, 477 S.E.2d at 731.Â  \r\nHere, no evidence indicates Husbandâ€™s loss of his \r\n  prior job resulted from wrongdoing or was motivated by a desire to avoid his \r\n  support obligation.Â  Husband worked at the same job in Michigan for over eighteen \r\n  years and moved to South Carolina only at his Wifeâ€™s insistence.Â  Although Husband \r\n  had difficulty finding comparable employment in South Carolina, he was the primary \r\n  wage earner throughout the marriage.Â  Wife admitted Husband was a â€œvery hard \r\n  workerâ€ and always provided for the family.Â  Moreover, Husband did not voluntarily \r\n  leave his job but was dismissed due to company lay offs.Â  He was still receiving \r\n  unemployment benefits at the time of trial and was actively seeking employment.Â  \r\n  Thus, the family court erred in its determination Husband was voluntarily underemployed.Â  \r\n  Husband had a good faith and reasonable explanation for his underemployment; \r\n  therefore, the family court should not have imputed income to him and should \r\n  have based his child support obligation on his actual income. \r\n3.Â  Equitable Apportionment of Marital Debt\r\nHusband next argues the family court erred in its \r\n  apportionment of Wifeâ€™s credit card debt.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œMarital propertyâ€ is defined as â€œall real and personal property \r\n  which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned \r\n  as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation . . . .â€ S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp.2004).Â  In making an equitable apportionment, the \r\n  family court should consider â€œ. . . any other existing debts incurred by the \r\n  parties or either of them during the course of the marriage[.]â€ S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 20-7-472(13) (Supp. 2004). â€œ[S]ection 20-7-472 creates a [rebuttable] presumption \r\n  that a debt either spouse incurred prior to marital litigation is a marital \r\n  debt and must be factored in the totality of equitable apportionment.â€Â  Hardy \r\n  v. Hardy, 311 S.C. 433, 436, 429 S.E.2d 811, 813 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\n  â€œBecause Hardy establishes a presumption in favor of treating a debt \r\n  as marital when it is incurred prior to marital litigation, the party claiming \r\n  the debt is nonmarital bears the burden to overcome that presumption.â€Â  Wooten \r\n  v. Wooten, 358 S.C. 54, 60, 594 S.E.2d 854, 857 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\nThe family court effectuated a fifty-fifty division of the \r\n  marital estate and ordered Husband to pay $9,000 of credit card debt.Â  Although \r\n  Wife accrued the credit card debt prior to initiating the marital litigation, \r\n  Husband contends she ran up the debt in contemplation of divorce.Â  He argues \r\n  the debt should be treated like an asset secreted or disposed of in contemplation \r\n  of divorce and its value assessed against Wifeâ€™s share of the marital estate.Â  \r\n  See Cooksey v. Cooksey, 280 S.C. 347, 352, 312 S.E.2d 581, 585 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1984).Â  However, Husband offered no evidence to substantiate this \r\n  claim, and therefore, did not overcome the presumption the debt was incurred \r\n  for the benefit of the marriage.Â  We find no abuse of discretion in the equitable \r\n  apportionment of the marital debt.Â  \r\n4. Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nHusband argues the court erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees to Wife.Â  We agree and remand for adjustment of award after child support \r\n  changes.\r\nOne of the factors to be considered in awarding \r\n  reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees and cost is the beneficial results obtained. Â Glasscock \r\n  v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).Â  As we have \r\n  found in favor of the Husband on several of his issues, we remand the issue \r\n  of attorneyâ€™s fees to the family court for any adjustments it determines are \r\n  necessary in light of our opinion.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the family court erred in ordering Husband \r\n  to pay child support past Adamâ€™s age of majority because he was not making satisfactory \r\n  progress toward the completion of high school.Â  We affirm the equitable apportionment \r\n  of marital debt.Â  We reverse the imputation of income to the Husband and the \r\n  order for the Husband to pay child support past Adamâ€™s age of majority.Â  We \r\n  remand to the family court for the recalculation of child support.Â  In addition, \r\n  we remand the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees to the family court for redetermination.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the order of the family court is \r\nAFFIRMED in part, and REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.Â  \r\n\r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n  1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-103","title":"Rayfield v.

Young, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-103\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2005 â€“ Filed February 10, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nMarvin Lee Robertson, Jr., of Mt. Pleasant, for Appellant\r\nSteven McKelvey and Thomas William McGee, III, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  Jadie C. Rayfield appeals \r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s order dismissing a rule to show cause, arguing the court \r\n  erred in finding no contempt of its order prohibiting the transfer of assets \r\n  by a judgment debtor in Rayfieldâ€™s personal injury action.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nRayfield brought a personal injury action in 1998 \r\n  in connection with injuries he sustained while using weightlifting equipment \r\n  at LifeQuest Fitness Center in Mount Pleasant.Â  In January 2000, he obtained \r\n  a $35,000 default judgment against â€œLIFEQUESTâ€ and subsequently filed an execution \r\n  against property that was executed nulla bona.Â  \r\nThis case involves multiple corporate entities \r\n  with similar names, a common registered agent for service of process, and some \r\n  common shareholders.Â  The first entity is Life Quest, Inc. (LQ1), which incorporated \r\n  in August 1991.Â  In January 1992, LQ1â€™s shareholders changed the companyâ€™s name \r\n  to LifeQuest of Mount Pleasant, Inc. (LQMP) and filed the change with the secretary \r\n  of stateâ€™s office in April 1992.Â  The second entity, LifeQuest, Inc. (LQ2), \r\n  incorporated in April 1992.Â  The third entity, LifeQuest of Charleston, Inc., \r\n  (LQC) incorporated later.Â  Wayne K. Caparas served as the registered agent for \r\n  each of these corporations. Steve DeGuzman and he owned LifeQuest shares.Â  \r\nFrom 1992 to 1994, entities identified \r\n  as â€œLife Quest, Inc.â€ or â€œLifeQuest, Inc.â€ opened utility accounts with South \r\n  Carolina Electric and Gas, Inc. (SCE&amp;G) for Mount Pleasant and Charleston \r\n  locations.Â  The entities made security deposits with SCE&amp;G to open the accounts. \r\n\r\nIn 1998, a foreclosure action against LQMP and \r\n  LQC resulted in the judicial sale of all of their assets.Â  SSN, Inc. purchased \r\n  LQMPâ€™s assets and SKS, Inc. purchased LQCâ€™s assets.Â  Timothy R. Sebold was SSNâ€™s \r\n  registered agent for service of process.Â  \r\nIn November 2002, following return of the nulla \r\n  bona execution, Rayfield obtained a circuit court order for supplemental \r\n  proceedings seeking to determine whether his judgment debtor, generally referred \r\n  to as â€œLifeQuest,â€ possessed any nonexempt property and assets that could be \r\n  used to satisfy his judgment.Â  Among other things, the order â€œenjoined the judgment \r\n  debtor â€¦ from making any transfer or other disposition of the property of the \r\n  judgment debtor, including â€¦ any funds due to the judgment debtor.â€Â  In February \r\n  2003, the court filed a second order for supplemental proceedings with a similar \r\n  prohibition on asset transfers after Rayfield discovered SCE&amp;G held approximately \r\n  $19,375 of deposits in LifeQuestâ€™s name. \r\nLater in February 2003, Caparas and DeGuzman went to SCE&amp;G \r\n  and requested that the LifeQuest accounts be closed and the deposits be refunded \r\n  to them.Â  SCE&amp;G closed the accounts as requested.Â  However, pursuant to \r\n  company policy, SCE&amp;G first applied the deposits against LifeQuestâ€™s unpaid \r\n  bill and current usage.Â  SCE&amp;G did not terminate service because LifeQuest \r\n  continued to operate in the buildings.Â  Instead, it opened new accounts in SSNâ€™s \r\n  name and credited the remainder of the deposits to the new accounts.Â  \r\nThe court issued a rule to show cause in March \r\n  2003.Â  After a hearing, the court dismissed the rule to show cause, finding \r\n  SSN had bought all LifeQuest assets, including rights to the SCE&amp;G deposits, \r\n  at the 1998 foreclosure sale.Â  Rayfieldâ€™s motion to reconsider was denied.Â  \r\n  This appeal followed.\r\n STANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW\r\nThis appeal comes to us in the posture of a dismissal \r\n  of a rule to show cause.Â  As such, we may reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision \r\n  regarding contempt only if it is without evidentiary support or is an abuse \r\n  of discretion.Â  Stone v. Reddix-Smalls, 295 S.C. 514, 516, 369 S.E.2d \r\n  840, 840 (1988).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs where the trial courtâ€™s ruling \r\n  is based on an error of law.Â  First Union Natâ€™l Bank v. First Citizens Bank \r\n  &amp; Trust Co., 346 S.C. 462, 466, 551 S.E.2d 301, 303 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nHaving carefully reviewed the \r\n  record, and based on our deferential standard of review, we find evidence to \r\n  support the findings of the trial court, even if were to consider the conflicting \r\n  evidence proferred by Rayfield.Â  Moreover, the confusion engendered by the various \r\n  corporate entities leads us to additionally conclude that, in any event, there \r\n  was no willful disobedience of a court order.Â  See Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. \r\n  Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 417, 526 S.E.2d 716, 722 (2000) (stating \r\n  that the appellate court may affirm for any reason appearing in the record).\r\nâ€œIt is well settled that contempt \r\n  results from willful disobedience of a court order; and before a person may \r\n  be held in contempt, the record must be clear and specific as to acts or conduct \r\n  upon which the contempt is based.â€Â  Cheap-Oâ€™s Truck Stop, 350 S.C. 596, \r\n  607, 567 S.E.2d 596, 519 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œA willful act is defined as one \r\n  done voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent to do something \r\n  the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law \r\n  requires to be done; that is to say with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard \r\n  the law.â€Â  Id. at 607-08, 567 S.E.2d at 520.\r\n AFFIRMED. \r\n HUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-104","title":"State v.

Husman and Vernon F. Dunbar, of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\nGregory F. Harley and Marvin H. Dukes, III, of Beaufort, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Island Club Apartments, a South \r\n  Carolina Limited Partnership, and Finlay Properties, Inc., its general partner \r\n  (collectively Island Club), filed a third-party complaint against Mark du Mas \r\n  and The Paces Foundation, Inc. (collectively du Mas), alleging du Mas: intentionally \r\n  interfered with the contractual relationship between Island Club and Charles \r\n  King, intentionally interfered with Island Clubâ€™s prospective relationships \r\n  regarding future development and construction contracts, and engaged in a civil \r\n  conspiracy to extort an ownership interest in Island Clubâ€™s project.Â  Island \r\n  Club appeals from the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of du \r\n  Mas on all claims.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nKing and Island Club entered into a contract \r\n  on April 22, 1999, for Island Club to purchase a tract of land from King for \r\n  $450,000.00. Island Club planned to develop a low-income apartment complex on \r\n  the property utilizing state tax credit financing. In order to obtain the financing, \r\n  Island Club had to close on the project no later than November 15, 1999, which \r\n  was provided in the contract.Â  Additionally, the contract required Island Club \r\n  to immediately pay $2,500.00 and deposit $27,500.00 into escrow.Â  The balance \r\n  of the purchase price was to be paid at the closing.Â  \r\nFollowing the execution of the contract, \r\n  Island Club had difficulty obtaining the required permits for the project.Â  \r\n  The delay led Island Club to seek amendments to the purchase contract, which \r\n  would allow for the closing to occur without simultaneous payment of the remainder \r\n  of the purchase price.Â  King accepted changes to the original contract by letter.Â  \r\n  Pursuant to these changes, King would receive a payment of $15,000 towards the \r\n  purchase price at the closing on November 12, 1999; Island Club would pay $1,500 \r\n  to defray any fees incurred by King; and Island Club would provide a promissory \r\n  note for the remainder of the purchase price due, payable on February 15, 2000.Â  \r\n\r\nAccording to Island Club, King agreed \r\n  to further changes to the contract during a telephone call on November 11, 1999.Â  \r\n  The alleged oral agreement extended the date of the promissory note until April \r\n  30, 2000, applied the $15,000 payment to closing costs, and increased the purchase \r\n  price to $460,000.Â  \r\nAlthough the letter changed the closing \r\n  date to November 12, 1999, the parties met on November 15, 1999 to close the \r\n  transaction. Prior to closing, King met with du Mas, seeking advice regarding \r\n  the transaction and its structure because du Mas was familiar with tax credit \r\n  financing. At the closing, du Mas asked questions on behalf of King regarding \r\n  the real estate deal and Island Clubâ€™s plans.Â  \r\nIsland Club presented closing documents \r\n  which reflected the alleged oral agreement rather than the written contract \r\n  or the modifications made in the letter.Â  King refused to proceed under the \r\n  terms of the oral contract and required the parties to close pursuant to the \r\n  original written contract, including the $450,000 payment. Subsequently, King \r\n  offered to sell the property if he received $100,000 at closing.Â  Island Club \r\n  presented testimony that du Mas offered to loan the money to Island Club in \r\n  exchange for an equity share of the project, though du Mas denied making such \r\n  an offer.Â  Â \r\nRegardless of what du Mas did or did not do, it \r\n  is undisputed that Island Club never tendered closing documents reflecting the \r\n  original contract or the terms of the written modification.Â  Additionally, Island \r\n  Club was not prepared to abide by the contract or the modification, which required \r\n  additional monies at the time of closing.Â  Because the parties could not agree \r\n  on the terms of the sale, the closing never took place.\r\nKing brought a declaratory judgment action \r\n  seeking a determination of the partiesâ€™ respective rights under the written \r\n  contracts.Â  Island Club filed counterclaims against King for breach of contract \r\n  and civil conspiracy, among other claims. [1] Â  Island Club also brought a third \r\n  party action against du Mas.Â  The third-party complaint alleged du Mas interfered \r\n  with the contractual relations between King and Island Club and prohibited the \r\n  closing from proceeding according to the oral agreement.Â  Additionally, the \r\n  complaint alleged du Mas interfered with the prospective relationships Island \r\n  Club would form and would benefit from in the development and construction of \r\n  the project.Â  Finally, the complaint asserted du Mas and King conspired to change \r\n  the terms of the contract to Island Clubâ€™s detriment and du Mas attempted to \r\n  extort an ownership interest in the project by changing the terms on the date \r\n  of the closing.Â  \r\nThe trial court granted du Masâ€™s motion \r\n  for summary judgment as to all claims in Island Clubâ€™s third-party complaint.Â  \r\n  The court found Island Club presented no evidence that King breached any enforceable \r\n  contract or that du Mas induced any breach.Â  The court found du Mas did not \r\n  interfere with prospective relations between Island Club and Finlay because \r\n  Finlay is Island Clubâ€™s general manager and the two integrally related entities \r\n  would not cease doing business simply because this particular real estate closing \r\n  did not occur.Â  Additionally, the court found there was no evidence du Mas was \r\n  the reason the real estate closing was not consummated.Â  Finally, the court \r\n  found the evidence did not support the remaining substantive claim of a civil \r\n  conspiracy, and in addition, Island Club failed to plead special damages.Â Â Â  \r\n  Â Â This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, \r\n  this court applies the same standard which governs the trial court:Â  summary \r\n  judgment is proper when â€œthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and \r\n  the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; \r\n  Baughman v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 114-15, 410 S.E.2d \r\n  537, 545 (1991).Â  â€œOn appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate \r\n  court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and \r\n  from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non&#8209;moving party below.â€Â  \r\n  Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Enforceable Contract\r\nIsland Club first asserts the trial court \r\n  erred in finding the oral modifications were not enforceable or that the closing \r\n  documents submitted were not sufficient evidence of the contract between King \r\n  and Island Club.Â  We disagree and find the trial court properly held the oral \r\n  modifications were unenforceable.Â  \r\nThe trial court properly relied upon the \r\n  Statute of Frauds in determining:Â  â€œUnder South Carolina law, a contract for \r\n  the sale of land must be in writing to be enforceable.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 32-3-10 \r\n  (Supp. 2003).Â  Pursuant to Camp v. Springs Mortgage Corp., 310 S.C. 514, \r\n  517, 426 S.E.2d 304, 305 (1993), the claim may only be based on the existence \r\n  of a valid contract.Â  Island Clubâ€™s attorney admitted in his deposition that \r\n  none of the oral modifications were ever placed in writing. Â \r\nIsland Club also seems to contend the \r\n  closing documents it provided for signature on November 15, 1999, are evidence \r\n  of the alleged modifications encompassed in their phone conversation. The documents \r\n  do not appear in the record on appeal, and therefore, they may not be considered \r\n  by this court.Â  See Rule 210, SCACR.Â  Furthermore, just as the oral modifications \r\n  themselves fail to satisfy the Statute of Frauds, so too would the closing documents \r\n  because there is no indication the documents were signed by King.Â  If King did \r\n  not sign them, he cannot be held to their contents under section 32-3-10.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we must look solely to the written, original contract and the letter modifying \r\n  the terms of the original contract, which were both signed by King, to determine \r\n  whether there was any interference by du Mas.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations\r\nIsland Club next contends the trial court \r\n  erred in finding there was no evidence of interference by du Mas in enticing \r\n  King not to go forward with the real estate closing on November 15.Â  Additionally, \r\n  Island Club contends the court erred in finding du Mas was not a stranger to \r\n  the contract, but was instead a consultant or agent of King.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs found by the trial court:\r\n\r\nUnder South Carolina law, a plaintiff must establish the following \r\n  elements to prevail on a claim for intentional interference with contractual \r\n  relations: (1) the existence of a valid contract; (2) the wrongdoerâ€™s knowledge \r\n  thereof; (3) his intentional procurement of its breach; (4) the absence of justification; \r\n  and (5) resulting damages. Camp v. Springs Mortgage Corp., 310 S.C. 514, \r\n  517, 426 S.E.2d 304, 305 (1993).\r\n\r\nThe trial court found that du Mas was \r\n  entitled to summary judgment on the intentional interference with contractual \r\n  relations cause of action because, among other reasons, there was no evidence \r\n  that King breached an enforceable contract.Â  We agree.\r\nAs found above, the only enforceable contract \r\n  was the original written contract as modified by the letter signed by King on \r\n  November 1, 1999.Â  Accordingly, Island Club must show evidence that King breached \r\n  this contract to support its claim. \r\nIsland Club never presented any evidence \r\n  of a breach of the written contract by King.Â  It is well-settled that â€œ[o]ne \r\n  who seeks to recover damages for breach of a contract, to which he was a party, \r\n  must show that the contract has been performed on his part, or at least that \r\n  he was, at the appropriate time, able, ready, and willing to perform it.â€Â  Swinton \r\n  Creek Nursery v. Edisto Farm Credit, ACA, 334 S.C. 469, 487, 514 S.E.2d \r\n  126, 135 (1999) (quoting Parks v. Lyons, 219 S.C. 40, 48, 64 S.E.2d 123, \r\n  126 (1951)).Â  Here, Island Club came to the closing prepared only to close in \r\n  accordance with the oral modifications to the agreement.Â  The promissory note \r\n  Island Club produced was due April 30th and not February 15th.Â  The HUD-1 statement \r\n  indicated the monies were in accordance with the oral modifications and not \r\n  the written agreements.Â  It was only after Island Club sought to close pursuant \r\n  to the oral modifications that King required the agreement to be completed pursuant \r\n  to the original contract, which called for a $450,000 cash payment at closing. \r\n\r\nBecause Island Club provided no evidence \r\n  that it attempted to close in accordance with the written agreements, it cannot \r\n  now complain that King breached the contract.Â  See id.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we find the trial court properly determined Island Club failed to present sufficient \r\n  evidence of a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether King breached \r\n  the written contracts and du Mas intentionally interfered with the contract. \r\n  [2] \r\nIII.Â Â Â  Intentional Interference with Prospective Relations\r\nIsland Club contends the trial court erred \r\n  in granting du Mas summary judgment on its claim of intentional interference \r\n  with the prospective contract between Island Club and Finlay.Â  We disagree and \r\n  find the trial court properly granted summary judgment to du Mas.\r\n\r\nThe tort of intentional interference with prospective \r\n  contractual relations was first recognized in the case of Crandall Corp. \r\n  v. Navistar [Intern.] Transp. Corp., 302 S.C. 265, 395 S.E.2d 179 (1990).Â  \r\n  The elements of the cause of action are (1) the intentional interference with \r\n  the plaintiff's potential contractual relations, (2) for an improper purpose \r\n  or by improper methods, (3) causing injury to the plaintiff.\r\n\r\nÂ Love v. Gamble, 316 S.C. 203, 214, 448 S.E.2d 876, 882 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\nThe Love case also explains what is required to show improper \r\n  methods necessary to support such a claim.Â  \r\n\r\nMethods of interference considered improper are those means \r\n  that are illegal or independently tortious, such as violations of statutes, \r\n  regulations, or recognized common-law rules.Â  Improper methods may include violence, \r\n  threats or intimidation, bribery, unfounded litigation, fraud, misrepresentation \r\n  or deceit, defamation, duress, undue influence, misuse of inside or confidential \r\n  information, or breach of a fiduciary relationship.Â  \r\nMethods also may be improper because they violate an established \r\n  standard of a trade or profession, or involve unethical conduct.Â  Sharp dealing, \r\n  overreaching, or unfair competition may also constitute improper methods.Â  \r\n\r\nId., at 215, 448 S.E.2d at 882-83 (quoting Duggin \r\n  v. Adams, 360 S.E.2d 832, 836-37 (1987) (citations omitted)).\r\nThe trial court specifically found du Mas could \r\n  not possibly interfere with the relations between Finlay and Island Club because \r\n  they were essentially the same entity â€“ Finlay was Island Clubâ€™s general partner.Â  \r\n  The court also concluded there was no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of \r\n  du Mas. We agree there was no evidence of wrongdoing.Â  In the deposition testimony \r\n  of representatives of Island Club, no representative could point to any specific \r\n  method used or anything said by du Mas which caused King to back out of the \r\n  sale of land, which is the basis for the prospective relationship between Finlay \r\n  and Island Club.Â  The only contention raised was the offer by du Mas to loan \r\n  $100,000 in exchange for an equity interest.Â  However, the parties admitted \r\n  it occurred after Island Club sought to close pursuant to the oral modifications \r\n  and King demanded a cash payment in order to close on November 15. \r\nAdditionally, it was admitted by attorneys representing Island \r\n  Club and Finlay that they did not recall anything du Mas said at the closing \r\n  that was not true or was a misrepresentation.Â  Accordingly, the trial court \r\n  properly concluded there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether \r\n  du Mas intentionally interfered with the prospective relations between Island \r\n  Club and Finlay.\r\nIV.Â Â Â  Civil Conspiracy\r\nIsland Clubâ€™s final claim is that the \r\n  trial court erred in finding there was no evidence of a civil conspiracy between \r\n  King and du Mas.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trial court found:\r\n\r\n[I]n order for a claim for conspiracy to go forward, the plaintiff \r\n  must plead and prove special damages, not simply reallege conduct and damages \r\n  arising from other torts.Â  See Vaught v. Waites, 300 S.C. 201, \r\n  208, 387 S.E.2d 91, 95 (S.C. Ct. App. 1989).Â  In this case, Third Party Plaintiffs \r\n  have done neither. The facts and damages asserted appear to be identical to \r\n  the facts and damages alleged in support of their other contract and claims. \r\n\r\n\r\nIsland Club does not appeal this finding \r\n  in its brief.Â  Accordingly, Island Club is bound by this unappealed ruling.Â Â  \r\n  See Charleston County Sch. Dist. v. South Carolina State Dairy Commâ€™n, \r\n  274 S.C. 250, 252, 262 S.E.2d 901, 902 (1980) (a party who does not appeal from \r\n  an adverse decision is bound by the decision); Dwyer v. Tom Jenkins Realty, \r\n  Inc., 289 S.C. 118, 120, 344 S.E.2d 886, 888 (Ct. App. 1986) (unchallenged \r\n  alternative findings can support a judgment).Â  Additionally, there is ample \r\n  evidence to support the finding of the trial court because the complaint merely \r\n  realleges the same damages, which were caused by the claims of interference \r\n  with contractual and prospective relations.Â  Â Thus, we affirm the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of du Mas on this issue.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court properly granted \r\n  summary judgment to du Mas on Island Clubâ€™s claim that he intentionally interfered \r\n  with the contract between King and Island Club because Island Club failed to \r\n  provide evidence of a breach of an enforceable contract between the parties.Â  \r\n  We also conclude the court properly found Island Club failed to provide evidence \r\n  to support its claim that du Mas intentionally interfered with the prospective \r\n  relationship between Island Club and Finlay.Â  Finally, we find the trial court \r\n  properly granted summary judgment to du Mas on Island Clubâ€™s claim that he entered \r\n  a civil conspiracy with King to injure Island Club. \r\n  [3] Â  Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  These claims are not the subject of this appeal.Â  The sole claims \r\n    on appeal arise from Island Clubâ€™s third-party complaint against du Mas.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Because we find that no breach of contract occurred, we need not \r\n    address Island Clubâ€™s argument that the trial court erred in finding du Mas \r\n    was a stranger to the contract.Â  See Futch v.

Moore, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, \r\n  all of Columbia; and Solicitor Edgar Lewis Clements, III, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Brenda Tart Dudley was convicted \r\n  of shoplifting and sentenced to ten years imprisonment, suspended upon the service \r\n  of four years and five years probation.Â  She argues on appeal that the trial \r\n  judge erred in:Â  (1) repeatedly interrupting counsel during the trial, expressing \r\n  bias, and thereby denying her a fair trial; and (2) giving her a sentence disproportionate \r\n  to the offense.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nOn August 7, 2001, Ronald Lyles, owner \r\n  of an Ace Hardware store, observed Dudley and a male removing the plastic packaging \r\n  from expensive pliers and placing the pliers in the maleâ€™s clothing.Â  The pliers \r\n  had been removed from their display several aisles over.Â  Dudley and the male \r\n  separated and left the store.Â  Lyles chased the male in the parking lot until \r\n  he disappeared down an alley.Â  Lylesâ€™ brother questioned Dudley until police \r\n  arrived.Â  Dudley denied taking anything from the store.Â  Dudley gave police \r\n  the name of a man she was with, but the man was never taken into custody.Â  The \r\n  pliers were never recovered.Â  Dudley was charged with shoplifting.Â  \r\nAfter electing to proceed in a bench trial, \r\n  Dudley was convicted.Â  She appeals.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Questioning by the Court\r\nDudley argues she was denied her right \r\n  to a fair trial because the trial judge interrupted counsel to ask questions \r\n  of the witnesses and the judge expressed a bias with regard to shoplifting charges.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nPrior to the bench trial, the trial judge \r\n  expounded on the problem of shoplifting in society.Â  The judge informed Dudley \r\n  that if she was convicted, he would put her in jail.Â  Throughout the trial, \r\n  the judge would interrupt counsel for both Dudley and the State to question \r\n  witnesses, including Dudley.Â  The judge denied Dudleyâ€™s motion for a directed \r\n  verdict, stating that there was no question that Dudley knew the male suspect, \r\n  that she was a confederate of the male suspect, and, citing the store-ownerâ€™s \r\n  testimony, that she knew what he was placing in his clothing.Â  However, the \r\n  judge went on to address the requirements for granting a motion for directed \r\n  verdict and to state that he had not yet weighed the facts and would not determine \r\n  the matter until he had heard the entire case.Â  \r\nAlthough Dudley argues the trial judge was biased \r\n  against those charged with shoplifting and that the judge indicated by his questions \r\n  that he had deliberated her guilt prior to the close of the case, this issue \r\n  is not properly before this court.Â  Dudley did not object to the judgeâ€™s pre-trial \r\n  statements, to his interruptions, or to his comments during the directed verdict \r\n  motion.Â  She never complained to the trial judge that his actions were denying \r\n  her of a fair trial, she failed to raise the issue of bias before the judge, \r\n  and she failed to request that the judge recuse himself.Â  Accordingly, she failed \r\n  to preserve her complaint for appellate review.Â  State v. Hicks, 330 \r\n  S.C. 207, 216, 499 S.E.2d 209, 214 (1998) (holding that issues not raised to \r\n  and ruled upon by the trial court are not preserved for appellate review); Bryan \r\n  v. Bryan, 296 S.C. 305, 311, 372 S.E.2d 116, 120 (Ct. App. 1988) (holding \r\n  that where a party failed to raise the issue of bias and failed to request recusal, \r\n  the issue of judicial bias was waived on appeal).Â  As Dudley never complained \r\n  about judge bias below, she cannot argue that issue on appeal.Â  \r\nII. Disproportionate Sentence\r\nDudley argues her sentence was out of proportion \r\n  with the severity of the crime, and thus her punishment was cruel and unusual.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nPrior to trial, the judge informed Dudley that \r\n  â€œif youâ€™re convicted, Iâ€™m gone [sic] put you in jail.Â  I want you to know that \r\n  ahead of time.Â  If you convicted [sic] and I find you guilty, Iâ€™m gone [sic] \r\n  put you in jail because you have used the system and you lost.â€Â  The trial judge \r\n  also warned Dudley that he had previously given a man convicted of shoplifting \r\n  a ten-year sentence. [2] Â  After finding Dudley guilty of the crime, the trial judge \r\n  considered her sentence.Â  Noting her long criminal history [3]  and after hearing from two of \r\n  her children, the trial judge asked Dudley to acknowledge her involvement in \r\n  the crime and he would consider that a mitigating circumstance in sentencing.Â  \r\n  When she again denied involvement, the judge gave her the weekend to consider \r\n  the matter further.Â  When the matter was reconvened, Dudley apologized to the \r\n  judge, but she stated she was not â€œdenying or acknowledgingâ€ her involvement \r\n  in the crime.Â  The trial judge sentenced her to ten years, suspended upon the \r\n  service of four years and five years probation.Â  \r\nWe note that this issue is not properly before \r\n  us.Â  Dudley did not object to the sentence or complain to the judge that the \r\n  sentence was disproportionate to the severity of the crime.Â  Accordingly, this \r\n  issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  Hicks, 330 S.C. at 216, \r\n  499 S.E.2d at 214; State v. Shumate, 276 S.C. 46, 47, 275 S.E.2d 288, \r\n  288 (1981) (holding that a failure to object to a sentence at the time of sentencing \r\n  precludes appellate review of the matter).Â  \r\nIn any event, a trial judge has broad discretion \r\n  in giving sentences within the statutory limits.Â  Brooks v. State, 325 \r\n  S.C. 269, 271-72, 481 S.E.2d 712, 713 (1997).Â  â€œA sentence is not excessive \r\n  if it is within statutory limitations and there are no facts supporting an allegation \r\n  of prejudice against a defendant.â€Â  Id. at 272, 481 S.E.2d at 713.Â  Dudley \r\n  was convicted of her third shoplifting offense.Â  The sentence for a third offense \r\n  shoplifting conviction is up to ten years imprisonment.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-110 \r\n  (2003) (defining shoplifting as a misdemeanor or felony, depending on the value \r\n  of the property taken); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-1-57 (2003) (â€œA person convicted \r\n  of an offense for which the term of imprisonment is contingent upon the value \r\n  of the property involved must, upon conviction for a third or subsequent offense, \r\n  be punished as prescribed for a Class E felony.â€); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-1-20 \r\n  (A)(5) (2003) (noting the punishment for a Class E felony is not to exceed ten \r\n  years).Â  Thus, the sentence was clearly within the statutory mandates.Â Â  \r\nâ€œThe cruel and unusual punishment clause \r\n  requires the duration of a sentence not be grossly out of proportion with the \r\n  severity of the crime.â€Â  State v. Jones, 344 S.C. 48, 56, 543 S.E.2d \r\n  541, 545 (2001).Â  Three factors are considered in determining proportionality:Â  \r\n  â€œ(1) the gravity of the offense compared to the harshness of the penalty; (2) \r\n  sentences imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction; and (3) sentences \r\n  for the same crime in other jurisdictions.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nDudley points to two cases from this jurisdiction \r\n  to support her argument that her sentence was disproportionate.Â  In State \r\n  v. Timmons, 349 S.C. 389, 563 S.E.2d 657 (2002), the defendant was sentenced \r\n  to eight years for his fifteenth shoplifting conviction and to two years for \r\n  possession of cocaine.Â  The court affirmed the convictions and sentences, deciding \r\n  only the issue of whether the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to \r\n  entertain the defendantâ€™s plea to possession of cocaine.Â  Timmons, 349 \r\n  S.C. at 394, 563 S.E.2d at 660.Â  Dudley also points to State v. Lewis, \r\n  325 S.C. 324, 478 S.E.2d 696 (Ct. App. 1996), in which a defendant with nearly \r\n  twenty prior convictions, including four prior shoplifting convictions, was \r\n  sentenced to three years for shoplifting.Â  This court affirmed his sentence, \r\n  finding it was within the statutory maximum.Â  Lewis, 325 S.C. at 327, \r\n  478 S.E.2d at 698.Â  \r\nWe find Dudleyâ€™s sentence did not violate the cruel and usual punishment \r\n  clause.Â  Her suspended sentence was within the statutory maximum.Â  Her sentence \r\n  is not grossly disproportionate to the crime of third offense shoplifting.Â  \r\n  Finally, her sentence was not grossly disproportionate to the sentences given \r\n  to others convicted of shoplifting, as seen in Timmons and Lewis.Â Â  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n Based on the foregoing, Dudleyâ€™s conviction \r\n  and sentence are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  Although Dudley does not complain about this specific incident, \r\n    we note that the trial judge seemed to indicate he would punish Dudley for \r\n    exercising her right to a trial.Â  After informing Dudley of her right to a \r\n    trial, the trial judge later said that if Dudley were convicted: â€œ. . . Iâ€™m \r\n    gone [sic] send you to jail for a lot longer time than I would if you were \r\n    entering a plea because youâ€™ve taken the time from the court when in your \r\n    heart-of-hearts you know whether or not youâ€™ve got a good defense or not.â€Â  \r\n    Dudley never objected to this statement at trial, and she does not complain \r\n    about this issue now.Â  Although it is impermissible for a trial judge to consider \r\n    the exercise of a constitutional right to a trial in sentencing, this issue \r\n    is not preserved for our review.Â  Davis v. State, 336 S.C. 329, 333, \r\n    520 S.E.2d 801, 803 (1999) (holding it was impermissible for a sentencing \r\n    court to consider the exercise of the right to trial in pronouncing sentence); \r\n    State v. Hazel, 317 S.C. 368, 370, 453 S.E.2d 879, 880 (1995) (same).Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Dudley had a prior criminal record that included two prior shoplifting \r\n    convictions, involuntary manslaughter, food stamp fraud, simple possession \r\n    of marijuana, receiving stolen goods, grand larceny, and giving a false statement \r\n    upon attempting to purchase a weapon.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-111","title":"State v.

Anderson, Circuit Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-112\r\nSubmitted February 1, 2005 â€“ Filed February \r\n  14, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nWilliam G. Rhoden, of Gaffney, for Appellant.\r\nYancey Patterson, pro se, of Blacksburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is an appeal of the family \r\n  courtâ€™s decision in favor of Yancey Patterson (Father) on Kimberly Pattersonâ€™s \r\n  (Mother) motion for reduction in child support.Â  We affirm.1\r\nFACTS\r\nYancey Patterson, Father, and Kimberly Patterson, \r\n  Mother, were formerly married.Â  In 2002, Father received custody of the coupleâ€™s \r\n  three children.Â  Mother received standard visitation rights â€œcontingent upon \r\n  [Mother] providing [Father] with monthly verification that she has seen and \r\n  met with her mental health doctor and/or counselor.â€Â  The family court gave \r\n  Father the right to suspend visitation if Mother did not comply with this order.Â  \r\n\r\nShortly thereafter, Mother was admitted to inpatient \r\n  treatment at Charter Hospital for alcohol abuse.Â  Upon leaving Charter, Mother \r\n  was arrested for her third driving while intoxicated (DUI) offense, though she \r\n  was only convicted of a DUI 2nd.Â  She then admitted herself into Patrick B. \r\n  Harris Hospital.Â  Following her inpatient treatment, Father suspended Motherâ€™s \r\n  visitation with the children.Â  Mother also successfully completed an outpatient \r\n  treatment program at Cherokee County Alcohol Commission.Â  \r\nIn August 2003, Mother made a motion for reduction \r\n  of child support and a contempt motion against Father for not allowing her to \r\n  see the children.Â  Husband answered and counterclaimed for child support arrearages \r\n  and to terminate or restrict Motherâ€™s visitation rights.Â  At a temporary hearing, \r\n  the trial court found Mother had significant alcohol abuse problems.Â  However, \r\n  it also recognized that â€œit appears these problems have subsided and she is \r\n  continuing counseling.â€Â  \r\nAt the final hearing, following Motherâ€™s presentation \r\n  of her case, the family court found in favor of the Father without the Father \r\n  presenting any evidence.Â  The trial court determined that Mother â€œis capable \r\n  of obtaining employment and is not entitled to a reduction or termination of \r\n  her child support.â€Â  However, while the original support rate of $127.15 per \r\n  week was to continue to accrue, Mother only had to pay $50 per week until the \r\n  final disposition of her social security disability claim.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has \r\n  authority to find the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence. Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d \r\n  154, 157 (1996).Â  This broad scope of review, however, does not require us to \r\n  disregard the findings of the trial court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, \r\n  276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  We are mindful that the trial \r\n  court, which saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate \r\n  their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Bowers \r\n  v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Involuntary Dismissal\r\nMother claims the trial court \r\n  erred in granting a directed verdict2 \r\n  sua sponte for Father at the conclusion of her case.Â  We disagree.\r\nMother never objected to the family \r\n  courtâ€™s action on the record filed with this court.Â  â€œIt is axiomatic that an \r\n  issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised \r\n  to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€Â  \r\n  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998).Â  \r\n  Accordingly, this issue is not preserved for our review.\r\nII. Child Support\r\nMother claims the trial court erred in not reducing \r\n  her child support obligation even though she was no longer employed.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial court can modify prospective child support \r\n  awards as circumstances warrant, but usually only upon a showing of changed \r\n  circumstances, including the ability of a supporting parent to pay.Â  Calvert \r\n  v. Calvert, 287 S.C. 130, 137, 336 S.E.2d 884, 888 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  Furthermore, \r\n  â€œto warrant a modification in . . . child support, the change of circumstances \r\n  must be either substantial or material.â€Â  Id. at 138, 336 S.E.2d at 888.Â  \r\n  The amount of child support awarded is within the sound discretion of the trial \r\n  court whose decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n  Millis v. Millis, 282 S.C. 610, 613, 320 S.E.2d 66, 67 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  \r\n\r\nMother testified that a doctor from Charter told her \r\n  she could not work, though she provided no affidavit to that effect.Â  Susan \r\n  Lineberger, Motherâ€™s counselor, also testified that Motherâ€™s â€œpsychiatric limitations \r\n  would make it almost impossible for anything except a sheltered workshop setting, \r\n  you know, where they just work for an hour or two a day.â€Â  However, Lineberger \r\n  made a contrary statement to the unemployment office.Â  Mother discounted her \r\n  own witnessâ€™s contrary statement to the unemployment office that Mother was \r\n  â€œokay to return to work on 3-11-2003â€ by arguing that â€œLineberger is not a doctor.Â  \r\n  Sheâ€™s a counselor.â€Â  Mother also admitted to signing numerous documents at the \r\n  unemployment office stating that she was able to work.Â  \r\nAlthough Mother had no income sources other than her \r\n  family, they contributed significant amounts towards her child support payments \r\n  and housing expenses.Â  The trial court determined that they could continue to \r\n  do so.Â  At the time of trial, Mother was also pursuing a social security disability \r\n  claim, which the trial court recognized had already been denied twice.Â  \r\nBased on this evidence, the trial court was â€œnot \r\n  satisfied [Mother was] disabled and [could not] work.â€Â  The trial court was \r\n  in a better position to evaluate the partiesâ€™ credibility and assign comparative \r\n  weight to their testimony.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d \r\n  610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Therefore, we find the trial court acted within its \r\n  discretion in deciding to retain the current child support obligation.Â  The \r\n  order of the trial court contemplated Motherâ€™s situation and provided a reasonable \r\n  procedure to review and evaluate any changed circumstances in the processing \r\n  of her disability claim.Â  In its order the court set up a review every ninety \r\n  days of the status of Motherâ€™s social security claim.Â  We will not disturb this \r\n  decision.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  decision is hereby \r\n Affirmed.  \r\n GOOLSBY, HUFF and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n  1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n  2 For a bench trial it would have been an involuntary \r\n    nonsuit rather than a directed verdict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-113","title":"McCallum v.

Olin McDougall, II, of Beaufort, for Appellant.\r\nKirsten Leslie Barr, of Mt. Pleasant, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Elaine W. McCallum appeals \r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s order affirming the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  Commissionâ€™s (the Commission) decision denying her workersâ€™ compensation benefits.Â  \r\n  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nMcCallum sought benefits for injuries \r\n  she sustained in an accident that allegedly occurred during the course and scope \r\n  of her employment as a gifted and talented teacher at St. Helena Elementary \r\n  School on August 23, 2000.Â Â Â  \r\nMcCallum testified on her own behalf before \r\n  the Single Commissioner.Â  According to her testimony, on the day of the accident \r\n  McCallum was calculating student grade point averages, which required her to \r\n  review student files located in the schoolâ€™s main office.Â  The files were stored \r\n  in eleven by fourteen inch boxes.Â  McCallum alleged she was lifting a box of \r\n  files when she turned and her right knee â€œpopped out.â€Â  She remained at work \r\n  for part of the day, but eventually signed a â€œblank leave sheet,â€ a form an \r\n  employee would sign to indicate absence, and went home.Â  McCallum did not fill \r\n  out a workersâ€™ compensation incident report or report her injury to a supervisor \r\n  that day.Â  She testified that Joyce Chisolm, the school nurse, heard her cry \r\n  out, â€œI think Iâ€™ve killed myself, Iâ€™ve hurt my knee.â€Â  However, at the hearing, \r\n  Chisolm testified that although her office was next to the student files, she \r\n  never heard McCallum cry out in pain and knew nothing of an injury.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFollowing the alleged accident, McCallum continued \r\n  working.Â  McCallum testified that she made an appointment with Dr. Rodin, an \r\n  orthopedist, for September 1, 2000.Â  Prior to her September 1 appointment with \r\n  Dr. Rodin, McCallum sought treatment for a cough from Dr. Jenkins, an associate \r\n  doctor within the same practice.Â  According to Dr. Jenkinsâ€™s record dated August \r\n  31, 2000, McCallum did not complain of any problem with her knee. \r\nMcCallum then saw Dr. Rodin, but failed to check \r\n  the box directly above her signature on the patient registration form to indicate \r\n  her injury was work related.Â  Language located directly above McCallumâ€™s signature \r\n  on the patient registration form stated that written workersâ€™ compensation verification \r\n  was needed before she could be seen if her problems were work related.Â  The \r\n  second page of the registration form contained a space for McCallum to list \r\n  â€œall injuriesâ€ she could recall with appropriate dates; however, she listed \r\n  no injuries and Dr. Rodin filled the space with a â€œÃ˜â€ symbol showing no injuries.Â  \r\n  On the final page of the registration form, McCallum signed a statement acknowledging \r\n  her responsibility for the payment of treatment costs. Â \r\nOn September 8, 2000, McCallum sustained another \r\n  injury while shopping.Â  McCallum was leaving a store and leaning on a shopping \r\n  cart when a store employee jerked the cart away causing her hip to â€œpopâ€ and \r\n  a pain to shoot down past her right knee.Â  \r\nMcCallum submitted Dr. Rodinâ€™s records in support \r\n  of her workerâ€™s compensation claim.Â  Dr. Rodinâ€™s record dated November 2, 2000, \r\n  reveals that McCallum was unsure of the date of her injury.Â  Dr. Rodinâ€™s report \r\n  dated September 1, 2000, suggests McCallum twisted her knee carrying boxes of \r\n  student files on August 23, 2000.Â  A notation at the bottom of the page shows \r\n  the note was not dictated until April 24, 2001, because, according to Rodin, \r\n  â€œthe original dictation couldnâ€™t be found.â€Â  Dr. Rodin testified, via deposition, \r\n  that he relied on his recollections, handwritten notes, and McCallumâ€™s registration \r\n  form in dictating the note.Â  McCallum, however, did not mention any history \r\n  of an accident on her registration form, and Dr. Rodinâ€™s handwritten notes indicate \r\n  McCallum had no history of an accident. Â Â Moreover, on March 21, 2001, \r\n  Dr. Rodin dictated an operative note reporting McCallum injured her knee as \r\n  the result of a fall.Â  The Commission affirmed the Single Commissionerâ€™s finding \r\n  that Dr. Rodinâ€™s dictation was neither reliable nor credible and his opinions \r\n  should be accorded little weight.Â Â  \r\nDr. Laverne Davis, principal of St. Helena Elementary \r\n  School, testified on behalf of Beaufort County School District at the hearing.Â  \r\n  Dr. Davis testified she first learned of McCallumâ€™s injury in November 2000.Â  \r\n  Prior to that time, Dr. Davis thought McCallum was out of work due to the injuries \r\n  she sustained while shopping.Â  Although McCallum informed Davis she needed to \r\n  attend physical therapy sessions, McCallum did not tell Davis she was injured \r\n  at work during the months of August, September, or October.Â  \r\nAfter she learned of McCallumâ€™s allegations, Dr. \r\n  Davis investigated by speaking to everyone who worked in the school office and \r\n  witnesses listed on the incident report McCallum filled out in November 2000, \r\n  including Terry Miller.Â  Dr. Davis testified that no one, including Miller, \r\n  had any knowledge of McCallum injuring her right knee at work.Â  The Single Commissioner \r\n  admitted the deposition testimony of Miller into evidence at the hearing.Â  In \r\n  her deposition, Miller testified that she first learned McCallum was injured \r\n  when she called and reported her shopping injury.Â  According to Miller, it was \r\n  not until much later that she learned McCallum alleged she was injured at work.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nFollowing the hearing, the Single Commissioner \r\n  issued an order finding McCallum was not entitled to workersâ€™ compensation benefits \r\n  because she was not injured within the course and scope of her employment.Â  \r\n  McCallum appealed to the Commission, arguing the Single Commissioner erred in:Â  \r\n  1). finding McCallum was not injured in the course and scope of her employment; \r\n  2). admitting the deposition testimony of Miller; 3). admitting the hearsay \r\n  testimony of Dr. Davis; 4). according little weight to Dr. Rodinâ€™s testimony \r\n  and records; and 5). finding McCallum lacked credibility and was too highly \r\n  educated to misunderstand the patient registration forms.Â  The Commission unanimously \r\n  affirmed the order of the Single Commissioner in its entirety.Â  \r\nMcCallum appealed to the circuit court.Â  The circuit \r\n  court affirmed the decision of the Commission and denied McCallumâ€™s motion for \r\n  reconsideration.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the \r\n  standard of review for decisions by the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission. Lark \r\n  v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 132, 276 S.E.2d 304, 305 (1981).Â  â€œThe \r\n  appellate courtâ€™s review is limited to deciding whether the commissionâ€™s decision \r\n  is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law.â€ \r\n  Hendricks v. Pickens County, 335 S.C. 405, 411, 517 S.E.2d 698, \r\n  701 (Ct. App. 1999); see Roper Hosp. v. Clemons, \r\n  326 S.C. 534, 536, 484 S.E.2d 598, 599 (Ct. App. 1997) (â€œOn appeal from the \r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission, this court may reverse where the decision \r\n  is affected by an error of law.â€).Â  â€œIt is not within our province to reverse \r\n  findings of the Commission which are supported by substantial evidence.â€Â  Broughton \r\n  v. South of the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 496, 520 S.E.2d 634, 637 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999).Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  Scope of Employment\r\nMcCallum argues the Commission erred in finding that she \r\n  did not prove she sustained an injury in the course and scope of her employment \r\n  on August 23, 2000.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn order to receive workersâ€™ compensation benefits, \r\n  McCallum must prove that she sustained an â€œinjury by accident arising out of \r\n  and in the course of the employment.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2004).Â  \r\n  The Commission found McCallum was not entitled to benefits and affirmed the \r\n  Single Commissionerâ€™s ruling that McCallum did not sustain an injury by accident \r\n  arising out of her employment on August 23, 2000.Â  We must affirm the Commissionâ€™s \r\n  ruling unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the substantial evidence on \r\n  the whole record.Â  Nettles v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. #7, 341 S.C. \r\n  580, 586, 535 S.E.2d 146, 149 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is â€˜not \r\n  a mere scintilla of evidence nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of \r\n  the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow \r\n  reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached \r\n  or must have reached in order to justify its action.â€™â€Â  Miller by Miller \r\n  v. State Roofing Co., 312 S.C. 452, 454, 441 S.E.2d 323, 324-25 \r\n  (1994) (quoting Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d \r\n  304, 306 (1981)).Â  â€œThe substantial evidence rule does not allow judicial fact-finding, \r\n  or the substitution of judicial judgment for agency judgment.Â  A judgment upon \r\n  which reasonable men might differ will not be set aside.â€Â  Toddâ€™s Ice Cream, \r\n  Inc. v. South Carolina Employment Sec. Commâ€™n, 281 S.C. 254, 258, 315 S.E.2d \r\n  373, 375 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  However, â€œ[w]here there is a conflict in the evidence, \r\n  either of different witnesses or of the same witnesses, the findings of fact \r\n  of the Commission as triers of the fact are conclusive.â€Â  Holcombe v. Dan \r\n  River Mills/Woodside Div., 286 S.C. 223, 225, 333 S.E.2d 338, 340 (Ct. App. \r\n  1985).\r\nOur review of the record indicates there was substantial \r\n  evidence to support the Commissionâ€™s finding McCallum was not injured in the \r\n  course of her employment.Â  The Commission noted that McCallumâ€™s claim for benefits \r\n  relied largely on her own testimony and that the Single Commissioner properly \r\n  discounted her testimony because it lacked credibility.Â  The testimony of school \r\n  employees Dr. Davis, Chisolm, and Miller contradicted McCallumâ€™s testimony.Â  \r\n  Specifically, Chisolm testified she did not witness McCallum injure herself, \r\n  and Davis testified McCallum did not report the alleged injury until November \r\n  2000.\r\nAdditionally, although McCallum relied on medical \r\n  records to support her claim, the Commission found some of Dr. Rodinâ€™s medical \r\n  records contradicted McCallumâ€™s testimony.Â  Dr. Rodinâ€™s record dated September \r\n  1, 2000, supported McCallumâ€™s account of the injury, but Dr. Rodin did not dictate \r\n  the note until the following April.Â  Dr. Rodin stated he relied on his recollections, \r\n  handwritten notes, and McCallumâ€™s registration form in dictating the note.Â  \r\n  McCallum, however, did not mention any history of accident on her registration \r\n  form, and Dr. Rodinâ€™s handwritten notes indicate McCallum had no history of \r\n  accident. Â Moreover, on March 21, 2001, Dr. Rodin dictated an operative \r\n  note reporting McCallum injured her knee as the result of a fall.Â  Therefore, \r\n  we find substantial evidence existed to support the Commissionâ€™s decision to \r\n  deny benefits to McCallum.\r\nII.Â  Deposition testimony\r\nMcCallum argues the Commission \r\n  erred in admitting the deposition testimony of Miller into evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs discussed above, McCallum \r\n  testified that she requested an incident report from school office manager, \r\n  Miller.Â  In response, the School District moved to have Millerâ€™s deposition \r\n  admitted to show Miller testified McCallum did not ask for an incident form.Â  \r\n  The Single Commissioner admitted the deposition over McCallumâ€™s attorneyâ€™s objection \r\n  that he had no notice the testimony would be admitted by the School District.Â  \r\n  McCallum also argues admission of the deposition violated Rule 32, SCRCP, which \r\n  governs the use of depositions in court proceedings.Â Â Â  \r\nWe find neither of McCallumâ€™s \r\n  arguments convincing.Â  Great liberality is exercised in permitting the introduction \r\n  of evidence in proceedings under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  Hamilton \r\n  v. Bob Bennett Ford, 339 S.C. 68, 70, 528 S.E.2d 667, 668 (2000).Â  Furthermore, \r\n  the record reveals that McCallumâ€™s attorney noticed the deposition and conducted \r\n  all of the questioning.Â  Although McCallumâ€™s attorney did not submit the deposition \r\n  as an exhibit, he was aware of the substance of the testimony.Â  Additionally, \r\n  in its notice of witnesses and medical reports submitted to McCallumâ€™s attorney, \r\n  the attorney for the school district indicated that Miller was a potential witness.Â  \r\n  Moreover, even if admitting the testimony was error, it was harmless because \r\n  the deposition was cumulative to other evidence in the record.Â  Specifically, \r\n  Dr. Davis testified that at no point in August, September, or October 2000 did \r\n  McCallum inform her of an injury to her right knee.Â  Dr. Davis also stated that \r\n  his investigation into McCallumâ€™s claim revealed that no one at the school had \r\n  any knowledge of the alleged injury.Â  Chisolm, the school nurse, also testified \r\n  that she was not aware of McCallumâ€™s injury until November despite being in \r\n  close proximity to the file room where the alleged injury occurred.Â  See \r\n  Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 299, 519 S.E.2d 583, 600 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999) (finding admission of improper evidence is harmless where it is merely \r\n  cumulative to other evidence); see also Eadie v. H.A. Sack Co., \r\n  322 S.C. 164, 172, 470 S.E.2d 397, 401 (Ct. App. 1996) (holding an error not \r\n  shown to be prejudicial does not constitute grounds for reversal).Â Â  \r\nIII.Â  Testimony\r\nMcCallum argues the Commission erred in allowing \r\n  Dr. Davis to testify regarding the hearsay comments of Miller in contravention \r\n  of Rule 802 of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence.Â  Rule 802, SCRE (â€œHearsay \r\n  is not admissible except as provided by these rules or by other rules prescribed \r\n  by the Supreme Court of this State or by statute.â€).Â  We disagree. \r\nDr. Davis testified that, \r\n  in her capacity as principal, she undertook to investigate McCallumâ€™s claim \r\n  after learning of the allegation.Â  In the course of her investigation, Davis \r\n  spoke to Miller, the schoolâ€™s office manager.Â  At the hearing, Davis related \r\n  that Miller said she had no knowledge of McCallumâ€™s alleged work-related injury.Â  \r\n  The Single Commissioner admitted the testimony over counselâ€™s hearsay objection.\r\nâ€œ[T]he South Carolina Rules of Evidence do not \r\n  apply in proceedings before the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.â€Â  Hamilton, \r\n  339 S.C. at 70, 528 S.E.2d at 668; see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-330(1) (2005) \r\n  (providing that except in proceedings before the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission, \r\n  rules of evidence apply in contested matters before an agency).Â  Therefore, \r\n  great liberality is exercised in permitting the introduction of evidence in \r\n  proceedings under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, and even hearsay evidence may \r\n  be admissible, provided it is corroborated by facts, circumstances or other \r\n  evidence.Â  Hamilton, 339 S.C. at 70, 528 S.E.2d at 668.Â  We find the \r\n  Commission committed no error in admitting Davisâ€™s hearsay comments into evidence \r\n  because it was corroborated by other evidence and circumstances.Â  Dr. Otis Smith, \r\n  the executive director of human resources for the school district, testified \r\n  that prior to his receipt of McCallumâ€™s family leave request form, the district \r\n  office had no knowledge of McCallumâ€™s injury.Â  He further testified he assumed \r\n  there was no injury because no one that he spoke with had any knowledge of an \r\n  accident form being filed.Â  Moreover, as previously noted, neither Davis nor \r\n  Chisolm were aware of McCallumâ€™s claim until November 2000.Â Â  \r\nIV.Â  Medical Testimony\r\nMcCallum argues the Commission erred in finding \r\n  the records and reports of Dr. Rodin should be accorded little weight because \r\n  there was not substantial evidence in the record to support that determination.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe final determination of witness credibility \r\n  and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the Full Commission.â€Â  \r\n  Ross v. American Red Cross, 298 S.C. 490, 492, 381 S.E.2d 728, 730 (1989).Â  \r\n  The reviewing court may not â€œsubstitute its judgment for that of the [Commission] \r\n  as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) \r\n  (2005).Â  \r\nThe Commission properly found Dr. Rodinâ€™s testimony \r\n  should be accorded little weight.Â  McCallum contends the Commission improperly \r\n  substituted its opinion for that of her expert, Dr. Rodin.Â  However, the Commission \r\n  only discounted Dr. Rodinâ€™s testimony regarding the date, time and place of \r\n  McCallumâ€™s injury and questioned the credibility of the medical records he maintained.Â  \r\n  As discussed above, internal inconsistencies existed between Dr. Rodinâ€™s records \r\n  and recollections.Â  Other witnessesâ€™ testimony, found credible by the Commission, \r\n  contradicted McCallum and Rodinâ€™s account of the injury.Â  Therefore, the Commission \r\n  committed no error in finding Dr. Rodinâ€™s medical records were of questionable \r\n  veracity and were outweighed by more credible evidence.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nV.Â  Credibility of Witness\r\nMcCallum argues the Commission erred in finding \r\n  she lacked credibility and was too highly educated to misunderstand a patient \r\n  registration form.Â  We disagree.\r\nPrior to her first visit with Dr. Rodin, McCallum \r\n  completed a patient registration form.Â  On the form, she failed to indicate \r\n  her accident was work related and listed no injuries.Â  The registration form \r\n  also informed McCallum workersâ€™ compensation verification was needed before \r\n  she could be seen if her problems were work related.Â  The Single Commissioner \r\n  found:\r\n\r\nThe Claimant has a Masters (plus) in education.Â  I often find \r\n  the injured workers unable to articulate their problems, which can lead to confusion.Â  \r\n  Here, I find that the Claimant is highly educated and I do not find it believable \r\n  that she signed certain documents, including insurance forms signed at Lowcountry \r\n  Medical Group, without understanding them. Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nMcCallum argued the finding was \r\n  erroneous before the Commission because the Single Commissioner could not make \r\n  a finding regarding McCallumâ€™s education level and credibility without expert \r\n  testimony.Â  The Commission found the argument without merit, and we agree.Â  \r\n  The Commission is accorded the final determination in all matters regarding \r\n  witness credibility.Â  Ross, 298 S.C. at 492, 381 S.E.2d at 730.Â  We will \r\n  not substitute our judgment for that of the Commission concerning the weight \r\n  of evidence on questions of fact.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005).Â  \r\n  Because it is the province of the Commission to evaluate witness credibility \r\n  in choosing to believe or disbelieve testimony, we find no error.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe record reveals substantial evidence \r\n  existed to support the Commissionâ€™s finding McCallum was not injured in the \r\n  course and scope of her employment.Â  We find no error in the Commissionâ€™s decision \r\n  to admit the deposition testimony of Miller into evidence and to allow Davis \r\n  to testify regarding Millerâ€™s statements.Â  Likewise, substantial evidence supports \r\n  the Commissionâ€™s finding that Dr. Rodinâ€™s reports and testimony were not credible \r\n  and should be accorded little weight.Â  Finally, we find no error in the Commissionâ€™s \r\n  determination McCallumâ€™s testimony was not credible.Â  Therefore, the order of \r\n  the circuit court affirming the Commission is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues \r\n    on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, \r\n    SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-114","title":"International Order fo Foresters v.

Mitchell, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nChristian G. Spradley, of Saluda, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Appellant Carrie Johnson argues \r\n  that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to respondent because \r\n  she never received notice of the hearing on the motion for summary judgment.Â  \r\n  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nThe International Order of Foresters filed \r\n  an interpleader action against Louise Johnson, Appellant, and Respondent Cecil \r\n  Yonce, Jr., to determine who should be awarded the proceeds of the life insurance \r\n  policy of decedent Silvester Johnson, Appellantâ€™s estranged spouse.Â  Appellant \r\n  was not named as a beneficiary to the policy, and the decedent executed an assignment \r\n  of the proceeds to Yonce.Â  Appellant alleged that Yonce committed fraud and \r\n  used undue influence over the decedent.Â  In discovery, Appellant refused to \r\n  admit that her husband signed the application for life insurance until she had \r\n  consulted a handwriting expert.Â  She alleged in her answer to the request to \r\n  admit that Yonce may have taken out policies of life insurance on other illiterate \r\n  workers.Â  \r\nYonce filed a motion for summary judgment, and \r\n  a hearing was scheduled for April 19, 2004.Â  Neither Appellant nor her attorney \r\n  appeared at the hearing, but the circuit court made the specific finding that \r\n  all the parties were properly served with notice according to the clerkâ€™s office. \r\n  [2] Â  Yonce presented the affidavit of the insurance agent to the effect \r\n  that there was no undue influence and the decedent understood what he was signing.Â  \r\n  The circuit court found Appellant had no interest in the matter because she \r\n  was not named a beneficiary and because the decedent took the life insurance \r\n  policy out on himself and then executed an assignment of the policy to Yonce.Â  \r\n  The circuit court granted Yonceâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â Â  Nothing in \r\n  the record indicates that Appellant filed a motion for reconsideration or a \r\n  motion for relief from judgment.Â  This appeal follows.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellant argues summary judgment was \r\n  improper because neither she nor her attorney were ever given notice of the \r\n  hearing as required by Rule 6(d), SCRCP. \r\n  [3] Â  We disagree.\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate where \r\n  there is no genuine issue of material fact and it is clear the moving party \r\n  is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  If further \r\n  inquiry into the facts is necessary to clarify application of the law, summary \r\n  judgment is not appropriate.Â  Tupper v. Dorchester Co., 326 S.C. 318, \r\n  325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997).Â  â€œSummary judgment should not be granted even \r\n  when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts if there is dispute as to the \r\n  conclusion to be drawn from those facts.â€Â  Id.Â  The evidence and the \r\n  inferences therefrom must be viewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving \r\n  party.Â  Id.\r\nAs Appellant correctly points out, notice \r\n  of a hearing should be sent to all parties no later than ten days before the \r\n  hearing.Â  Rule 6(d), SCRCP.Â  Yonce alleges in his brief that Appellant was served \r\n  notice of the hearing on March 9, 2004, for the April 19, 2004, hearing.Â  There \r\n  is no evidence in the record regarding when Appellant was served.Â  The circuit \r\n  court, however, specifically found that notice of the hearing was properly given.Â  \r\n  Despite the circuit courtâ€™s ruling on the notice issue, Appellant failed to \r\n  complain before the circuit court in a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion that she was \r\n  not served notice of the hearing.Â  Because she failed to raise this argument \r\n  before the circuit court, it is not preserved for appellate review.Â  Mize \r\n  v. Blue Ridge Ry. Co., 219 S.C. 119, 129-30, 64 S.E.2d 253, 258 (1951) (holding \r\n  that an issue not specifically raised by the appellant before the trial court \r\n  was not preserved for appellate review, regardless of the fact that the trial \r\n  judge addressed it).Â  \r\nFurther, even on the merits, we find the \r\n  grant of summary judgment was proper.Â  Viewing the evidence in the light most \r\n  favorable to Appellant, the life insurance policy on the decedent was executed \r\n  by the decedent to insure his own life, decedent executed a valid assignment \r\n  of the insurance proceeds to Yonce, and decedent never named Appellant a beneficiary \r\n  of the policy.Â  There is no evidence in the record of any fraud on Yonceâ€™s part, \r\n  nor is there evidence that the decendentâ€™s handwriting was forged on the life \r\n  insurance policy or the assignment.Â  Accordingly, there is no evidence which \r\n  supports Appellantâ€™s claim to the proceeds.Â  Based on this evidence, we find \r\n  the circuit court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of Yonce.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary \r\n  judgment is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues \r\n    on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, \r\n    SCACR.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  At the time of the summary judgment hearing, the Independent Order \r\n    of Foresters had deposited the proceeds of the life insurance policy with \r\n    the clerk of court and was no longer a party.Â  Also, Louise Johnson had failed \r\n    to answer the complaint and was in default.Â  The only remaining parties to \r\n    the action were Yonce and Appellant.Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Â  Appellant raises two issues on appeal, both of which deal with whether \r\n    it was appropriate for the circuit court to grant summary judgment where there \r\n    was no notice given.Â  Accordingly, we treat the issues as one.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-115","title":"Toner v.

Funderburk, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Michael Toner appeals the decision \r\n  of the circuit court, affirming the Employment Security Commissionâ€™s finding \r\n  that workersâ€™ compensation benefits are excluded from the definition of wages \r\n  for purposes of calculating unemployment benefits.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAs a result of an onâ€“the-job injury, Michael \r\n  Toner received temporary total workersâ€™ compensation payments from November \r\n  9, 2000 to May 15, 2002.Â  During this same time period, Toner was laid-off from \r\n  work because of a lack of work. He sought unemployment benefits for the period \r\n  in question.Â Â  To determine the amount of his unemployment benefits, the South \r\n  Carolina Employment Security Commission considered the holidays and vacation \r\n  days for which Toner was paid and which the employer reported to the Commission \r\n  as wages. However, the Commission determined the workersâ€™ compensation payments \r\n  should not be included in determining the amount of Tonerâ€™s unemployment benefits, \r\n  because they are not included in the definition of wages.Â  Section 41-27-380 \r\n  of the South Carolina Code (1986) defines wages for tax and benefit computations \r\n  under the South Carolina Employment Security Law as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) â€œWagesâ€ means all remuneration \r\n  paid for personal services, including commissions and bonuses, any sums paid \r\n  to an employee by an employer . . ..â€Wagesâ€ does not include:\r\n(a) The amount of any payment with respect to services \r\n  performed in behalf of an individual in its employ under a plan or system established \r\n  by an employing unit which makes provision for individuals in its employ generally \r\n  or for a class or classes of individuals (including any amount paid by an employing \r\n  unit for insurance or annuities or into a fund to provide for any such payment), \r\n  on account of (i) retirement, (ii) sickness or accident disability, (iii) medical \r\n  and hospitalization expenses in connection with sickness or accident disability, \r\n  or (iv) death . . . .\r\n\r\nToner appealed to the circuit court, which agreed with \r\n  the Commission, finding workersâ€™ compensation payments are not wages for purposes \r\n  of calculating Tonerâ€™s unemployment benefits.Â  Toner now appeals the circuit \r\n  courtâ€™s order.&nbsp; \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn an action at law, tried without a jury, \r\n  our standard of review extends only to the correction of errors of law.Â  Okatie \r\n  River, L.L.C. v. Southeastern Site Prep, L.L.C., 353 S.C. 327, 334, 577 \r\n  S.E.2d 468, 472 (Ct. App. 2003) (citations omitted).Â  The circuit courtâ€™s findings \r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal unless they are wholly unsupported by the evidence \r\n  or controlled by an erroneous conception of the application of the law.Â  Gordon \r\n  v. Colonial Ins. Co. of California, 342 S.C. 152, 155, 536 S.E.2d 376, 378 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2000) (citation omitted).\r\nLikewise, when reviewing the decision \r\n  of an administrative agency, our scope of review is limited, and we will neither \r\n  overturn the agencyâ€™s findings of fact if they are supported by substantial \r\n  evidence, nor will we disturb the agencyâ€™s rulings on questions of law if they \r\n  are sound as a matter of law.Â  Alton Newton Evangelistic Assâ€™n, Inc. v. South \r\n  Carolina Employment Sec. Commâ€™n, 284 S.C. 302, 304, 326 S.E.2d 165, 166 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1985) (citations omitted).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nToner argues that because workerâ€™s compensation \r\n  is not specifically excluded from the definition of wages and because the Employment \r\n  Security Law is â€œremedial social legislation,â€ workerâ€™s compensation should \r\n  be included when calculating unemployment benefits.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe cardinal rule of statutory construction \r\n  is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.â€Â  Charleston \r\n  County Sch.

Bruce, 275 S.C. \r\n  35, 37, 267 S.E.2d 424, 425 (1980)).Â  The best evidence of the legislative intent \r\n  is in the text of the statute.Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 \r\n  S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000) (citation omitted).Â  We cannot construe a statue without \r\n  regard to its plain and ordinary meaning, and we cannot â€œresort to subtle or \r\n  forced construction in an attempt to limit or expand a statuteâ€™s scope.â€Â  Pascal \r\n  v. State Election Commâ€™n, 317 S.C. 434, 437, 454 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1995) \r\n  (citation omitted).Â  Further, if statutes deal with the same subject matter, \r\n  we must reconcile them, â€œif possible, so as to render both operative.â€Â  Hodges, \r\n  341 S.C. at 88, 533 S.E.2d at 583 (citing Butler v. Unisun Ins., 323 \r\n  S.C. 402, 408, 475 S.E.2d 758, 761 (1996)).\r\nSection 41-27-380 of the South Carolina \r\n  Code (1986) provides the definition of wages for computing benefits under our \r\n  South Carolina Employment Security Law.Â  Workersâ€™ compensation is neither expressly \r\n  included in nor expressly excluded from the definition of wages.Â  See \r\n  S.C. Code Â§ 41-27-380 (1986).\r\nHowever, we are convinced that workersâ€™ \r\n  compensation benefits are payments to employees under employersâ€™ plans for a \r\n  class of individuals because of sickness or accident disability or expenses \r\n  in connection therewith and are implicitly excluded from the statuteâ€™s definition \r\n  of wages.Â  Tonerâ€™s argument that workersâ€™ compensation is not excluded from \r\n  the definition of wages turns on the notion that the workersâ€™ compensation system \r\n  is a creature of statuteâ€”not one of an employing unit.Â  Under the laws governing \r\n  workersâ€™ compensation, employers may opt out of the program if they prove they \r\n  have the ability to pay similar benefits or show they are self-insured.Â  See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-5-10 (1976); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-5-20 (Supp. 2004).Â  In \r\n  other words, employers may participate in the workersâ€™ compensation plan or \r\n  provide some other means of covering workers.Â  Such a system of payments is \r\n  the very type intended to be excluded by the Legislature from the calculation \r\n  of unemployment benefits. This holding is consistent with the way other courts \r\n  have decided this issue. See Molnar v. Admâ€™r, Unemployment Comp. Act \r\n  Â 685 A.2d 1157, 1162 (Conn. Super. Ct. 1995), affâ€™d, 685 A.2d 1107 \r\n  (Conn. 1996) (finding reasonable the board of reviewâ€™s decision that workerâ€™s \r\n  compensation payments did not constitute qualifying â€œwagesâ€ for purposes of \r\n  calculating unemployment compensation benefits under Connecticut law); Lavin \r\n  v. Alton Box Bd. Co., 431 So.2d 202, 203 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1983) (noting \r\n  that temporary total disability benefits are not wages to be used in computing \r\n  workerâ€™s average weekly wage); Swackhammer v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Review, \r\n  484 A.2d 851, 853 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1984) (finding that wages as used in Pennsylvania \r\n  unemployment compensation law did not include workerâ€™s compensation benefits \r\n  since they are awarded on account of job related disabilities and not in consideration \r\n  of personal services).\r\nToner also argues that inasmuch as vacation \r\n  and holiday pay were included in his wages and reported by the employer to the \r\n  commission, the definition of wages should be expanded in this case to include \r\n  workerâ€™s compensationÂ  payments. We disagree. Vacation and holiday pay were \r\n  part of his compensation set by the terms of Tonerâ€™s hiring agreement and are \r\n  necessarily included in the wages on which the employer is taxed for Employment \r\n  Security purposes. See State by Bassett v. Hatcher, 131 S.E.2d \r\n  172, 175 (W. Va. 1963); accord Carter v. Bd. of Review Under Oklahoma \r\n  Employment Sec. Act, 323 P.2d 362 (Okla. 1958). \r\nFinally, Toner argues that because our \r\n  Employment Security Law is remedial social legislation, it should be liberally \r\n  construed to include workerâ€™s compensation as wages. In Alton Newton, \r\n  we held â€œ[a]s social legislation, the Employment Security Law should be construed \r\n  to provide protection to as many employees as possible.â€Â  284 S.C. at 305, 326 \r\n  S.E.2d at 167 (citations omitted). Nevertheless, Toner has the burden to show \r\n  he meets the eligibility requirements of the statute. Hyman v. South Carolina \r\n  Employment Sec. Commâ€™n, 234 S.C. 369, 373, 108 S.E.2d 554, 556 (1959).Â Â  \r\n  Considering our scope of review, the purpose of the Employment Security Law, \r\n  and the language of the statute, we conclude the circuit court was correct in \r\n  holding workersâ€™ compensation benefits are excluded from the definition of wages.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause we conclude workersâ€™ compensation benefits \r\n  are not wages for the purpose of calculating unemployment benefits, we are constrained \r\n  to affirm the order of the circuit court. If there is an element of unfairness \r\n  in this decision, any remediation of such a result rests in the hands of the \r\n  Legislature.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, J., SHORT, J. and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-116","title":"Farm Bureau v.

Kefalos, of Charleston, for Appellants.\r\nRobert J. Thomas and William E. Hopkins, Jr., both of Columbia, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this insurance coverage \r\n  dispute, Appellants (the Hawkinses) appeal the circuit courtâ€™s denial of their \r\n  motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) or alternatively for \r\n  a new trial.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent South Carolina Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance \r\n  Company (Farm Bureau) issued a homeownerâ€™s insurance policy concerning property \r\n  located at 3826 Highway 17A North, Jamestown, South Carolina.Â  The policy was \r\n  issued based on the application signed by Arnold Hawkins.Â  In the application, \r\n  Arnold Hawkins represented he owned the property to be covered by the policy.\r\nIn January 2000, the property sustained substantial \r\n  fire damage.Â  After investigation by both the South Carolina Law Enforcement \r\n  Division and Farm Bureau, it was determined the fire was intentionally set.Â  \r\n  The investigation also revealed Arnold Hawkins did not own the property when \r\n  he signed the insurance application.Â  At the time Arnold Hawkins made the representation \r\n  of ownership on the application, title to the property was in the name of Arnoldâ€™s \r\n  daughter, Lakeya Hawkins.\r\nFarm Bureau initiated a declaratory judgment action \r\n  seeking a judgment that coverage was not available because the fire was intentionally \r\n  set by, or at the direction of, Arnold Hawkins or, alternatively, Farm Bureau \r\n  was relieved of its obligations under the policy due to the material misrepresentations \r\n  of Arnold Hawkins as to the ownership of the property.Â  Pursuant to special \r\n  interrogatories, the jury found for Farm Bureau only on the material misrepresentation \r\n  claim.Â  The Hawkinses filed a motion for JNOV or a new trial pursuant to Rule \r\n  50, SCRCP.Â  The circuit court denied the motion, and this appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Hawkinses allege the circuit court erred in denying \r\n  the motion for JNOV or, in the alternative, a new trial.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt the close of the evidence, the Hawkinses moved \r\n  for a directed verdict on one ground as to the misrepresentation claim. [1] Â  The sole argument was based on the failure \r\n  of Farm Bureau prior to trial to tender the premiums to the named insured, Arnold \r\n  Hawkins.Â  We initially observe that this defenseâ€”failure to tender premiumsâ€”constitutes \r\n  an affirmative defense or matter of â€œavoidanceâ€ under Rule 8(c), SCRCP.Â  See \r\n  Oyler v. Oyler, 293 S.C. 4, 7, 358 S.E.2d 170, 172 (Ct. App. 1987) (â€œ[A]n \r\n  avoidance is a defense which goes beyond the basic elements of the opposing \r\n  partyâ€™s cause and depends upon additional facts to defeat the claimâ€); see \r\n  generally Floyd v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 285 S.C. \r\n  148, 150, 328 S.E.2d 132, 132 (Ct. App. 1985); Brown v. Dr. Michael D. HoffmanÂ  \r\n  &amp; Assoc., 111 S.W.3d 826, 827 (Texas 2003); McCord v. Horace Mann \r\n  Ins. Co., 390 F.3d 138, 141 (Mass. 2004) (referring to failure of condition \r\n  precedent as an affirmative defense).\r\nThe Hawkinses pled no such defense, and the general \r\n  rule precludes consideration of claims or defenses not presented in the pleadings.Â  \r\n  See Fraternal Order of Police v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, \r\n  352 S.C. 420, 435, 574 S.E.2d 717, 725 (2002) (â€œGenerally, claims or defenses \r\n  not presented in the pleadings will not be considered on appealâ€); Howard \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways, 343 S.C. 149, 155, 538 S.E.2d 291, \r\n  294 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œAffirmative defenses are waived if not pledâ€); Oyler \r\n  v. Oyler, 293 S.C. at 6, 358 S.E.2d at 171-72 (stating that under Rule 8(c), \r\n  SCRCP, a party must set forth in its pleadings any matter â€œconstituting an avoidance \r\n  or affirmative defenseâ€); R. Brown &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Credit Alliance Corp., \r\n  473 A.2d 1168, 1170 (Vt. 1984) (â€œ[A] matter raised constituting an avoidance \r\n  is an affirmative defense and must be affirmatively pledâ€). While a matter not \r\n  included in the pleadings may be tried by the express or implied consent of \r\n  the parties under Rule 15(b), SCRCP, the scant record before us does not allow \r\n  us to affirmatively find such consent.Â  The burden is on the appellant to present \r\n  a sufficient record for review.Â  State v. Mitchell, 330 S.C. 189, 194, \r\n  498 S.E.2d 642, 645 (1998); State v. Smith, 359 S.C. 481, 490, 597 S.E.2d \r\n  888, 893 (Ct. App. 2004). [2] Â  \r\n\r\nWe do not believe the Hawkinsesâ€™ argument would \r\n  prevail in any vent.Â  We begin this analysis with the acknowledgement that generally \r\n  â€œan insurance company suing to cancel a policy for fraud[] must restore or tender \r\n  the premiums received as a condition of relief.â€Â  Arnold v. Life Ins. Co. \r\n  of Georgia, 226 S.C. 60, 73, 83 S.E.2d 553, 559 (1954).Â Â  The supreme court \r\n  revisited this issue in the case of McElmurray v. American Fidelity Fire \r\n  Insur. Co., 236 S.C. 195, 113 S.E.2d 528 (1960).Â  InÂ  McElmurray, \r\n  the court focused on the policy language and determined that â€œ[t]he policy contract \r\n  expressly negates necessity for return to the insured of the unearned premium \r\n  in order to effect cancellation of the policy by the insurer.â€Â  Id. at \r\n  205, 113 S.E.2d at 533.Â Â  We are persuaded the policy language here compels \r\n  the same conclusion.Â  Under the terms of the policy, the parties agreed that \r\n  â€œ[i]f the premium is not refunded with the cancellation or when the policy is \r\n  returned to us, we will refund it within a reasonable time after the \r\n  date cancellation takes effect.â€Â  (emphasis in original)Â  Farm Bureau, therefore, \r\n  was not required to refund the premiums to Arnold Hawkins as a condition precedent \r\n  to maintaining the underlying declaratory judgment action.Â  Moreover, Farm Bureauâ€™s \r\n  efforts to cancel the policy did not â€œtake effectâ€ until it prevailed on its \r\n  misrepresentation claim.Â  In this regard, during the hearing on post-trial motions, \r\n  Farm Bureau advised that â€œa check [will be] available for the Hawkinsâ€™ [sic] \r\n  as soon as the judgment is entered.â€Â  The Hawkinses, through counsel, promptly \r\n  refused the tender.Â  And finally, it is beyond dispute that an earlier tender \r\n  of the premiums to Arnold Hawkins would have likewise been a futile act, and \r\n  any contention to the contrary finds no traction in the abbreviated record before \r\n  us. \r\nHaving addressed the sole ground asserted by the \r\n  Hawkinses in their directed verdict motion, we decline to addressâ€”as unpreservedâ€”the \r\n  remaining issues argued in their brief.Â  A directed verdict motion stating the \r\n  specific grounds is a prerequisite for a subsequent motion for judgment notwithstanding \r\n  the verdict.Â  See In re McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 93, 551 S.E.2d \r\n  235, 238 (2001) (stating only grounds raised in directed verdict motion may \r\n  properly be reasserted in JNOV motion).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor these reasons, we find that the trial court \r\n  acted within its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial and properly \r\n  denied the JNOV motion. \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  It does appear the Hawkinses may have made an initial motion \r\n    for a directed verdict at the close of Farm Bureauâ€™s case in chief, but that \r\n    portion of the trial transcript was not included in the record on appeal.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Farm Bureau advanced this argument in its final brief.Â  The \r\n    Hawkinses submitted a final reply brief, but chose not to respond to their \r\n    failure to include this defense in their Answer and Counterclaim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-117","title":"General Heating v.

According to Clark, Scroggs claimed that the filing of the lien would \r\n  prevent SMD from arranging funding for the money then due General under the \r\n  contract.\r\nRobert Scroggs, President of SMD, testified there \r\n  were some problems with the work completed by General, but he was unsure of \r\n  the time frame, and he did not contact General regarding the problems.Â  He admitted \r\n  he never wrote General regarding the problem, and the problems were not mentioned \r\n  in any of the documents generated during the relevant time period.Â  Scroggs \r\n  acknowledged the weak financial situation of SMD and the need for additional \r\n  funding.Â  Scroggs denied that he personally guaranteed the payment of the remaining \r\n  balance due General, asserting instead that he was merely guaranteeing that \r\n  SMD would pay what was owed.Â  \r\nMichael Bird, also with SMD, testified that he \r\n  was not satisfied with some of Generalâ€™s work, although he acknowledged the \r\n  absence of correspondence to confirm his trial testimony.Â  \r\nThe trial court found General had established its \r\n  claims against SMD for breach of the underlying contract and Scroggs for his \r\n  personal guaranty for the amount owed.Â  The court found in favor of General \r\n  on SMDâ€™s counterclaims.Â  The court entered judgment in favor of General in the \r\n  amount of $49,028 plus interest.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAn action for breach of contract seeking money damages \r\n  is an action at law.â€Â  R &amp; G Constr., Inc. v.

City \r\n  of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976). â€œThe judgeâ€™s \r\n  findings are equivalent to a juryâ€™s findings in a law action.â€Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n SMD contends that General failed to meet a condition \r\n  precedent in the contract, specifically the provision concerning Generalâ€™s duty \r\n  of â€œsatisfactory performance.â€Â  Scroggs maintains the court erred in finding \r\n  he personally guaranteed any amount owed by SMD.Â  We disagree, finding ample \r\n  evidence in the record to support the judgment of the able trial judge.\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Condition Precedent\r\nThe contract provided:Â  â€œThe Contractor \r\n  [SMD] agrees to pay the Subcontractor [General] for satisfactory performance \r\n  of the Contractorâ€™s Work . . . .â€Â  A condition precedent entails something that \r\n  is essential to a right of action.Â  Worley v. Yarborough Ford, Inc., \r\n  317 S.C. 206, 210, 452 S.E.2d 622, 624 (Ct. App. 1994).Â Â  â€œIn contract law, \r\n  the term connotes any fact other than the lapse of time, which, unless excused, \r\n  must exist or occur before a duty of immediate performance arises.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n  We agree the satisfaction of SMD was a condition precedent to the payment of \r\n  the contract price, as such finding is not challenged on appeal and it represents \r\n  the law of this case.Â  Indeed, Algary, Generalâ€™s vice president, admitted the \r\n  work had to meet SMDâ€™s satisfaction.\r\nThe fundamental fallacy in SMDâ€™s position is its \r\n  apparent contention that its trial testimonyâ€”that it was not satisfied with \r\n  Generalâ€™s workâ€”is dispositive.Â  Our standard of review requires us to affirm \r\n  unless there is no evidence to support the trial judgeâ€™s findings. The court \r\n  found Generalâ€™s work was satisfactorily completed, and the record supports such \r\n  finding.Â  For example, the testimony of Algary and Clark, deemed credible by \r\n  the fact finder, supports this finding.Â  The trial judge assigned weight to \r\n  the absence of credible evidence of SMDâ€™s purported dissatisfaction with Generalâ€™s \r\n  work during the relevant time period prior to litigation, and we find no error \r\n  in this regard.Â  It was well within the province of the trial judge to view \r\n  the testimony offered by SMD as self-serving, especially in light of the complete \r\n  absence of documentation to support its position.Â  As there was evidence to \r\n  support the trial judgeâ€™s determination of SMDâ€™s satisfaction with the work \r\n  of General, and the corresponding finding that SMD owed the balance of the contract \r\n  price to General, we affirm the judgment for General on its breach of contract \r\n  claim against SMD.Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Personal Guaranty\r\n\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Intent of Letters\r\n\r\nScroggs contends the letters he signed \r\n  were not evidence of a personal guaranty, but instead indicated his willingness \r\n  to assure payment by SMD.Â  We disagree and find evidence to support the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s finding that Scroggs was personally liable to General for the remainder \r\n  of the contract price.\r\nâ€œA guaranty of payment is an absolute \r\n  or unconditional promise to pay a particular debt if it is not paid by the debtor \r\n  at maturity.â€Â  Citizens &amp; S. Nat. Bank of South Carolina v. Lanford, \r\n  313 S.C. 540, 543, 443 S.E.2d 549, 550 (1994).Â  Additionally, â€œa contract signed \r\n  by an individual as an officer has been held to be the contract of the officer \r\n  where the contract contains a provision with respect to individual liability \r\n  of the signing officer.â€Â  Klutts Resort Realty, Inc. v. Downâ€™Round Dev. Corp., \r\n  268 S.C. 80, 87, 232 S.E.2d 20, 24 (1977) (citing 19 Am. Jur. 2d, Corporations \r\n  Â§ 1343 (1965)).Â  A director, officer, or other agent, signing a promise or guaranty \r\n  in the proper form for an individual, is not relieved from personal liability \r\n  by the addition to his name of terms such as director, president or other designation.Â  \r\n  Id. at 88, 232 S.E.2d at 24.Â  â€œThese terms are regarded merely as [d]escriptio \r\n  personae, that is, a term descriptive of the person rather than the relationship \r\n  in which he signs the agreement.â€Â  Id.  \r\nGeneral provided evidence of conversations with \r\n  Scroggs in December 2000 and January 2001 in which Scroggs offered his â€œpersonal \r\n  guaranteeâ€ of payment provided General forgo its right to file a mechanicâ€™s \r\n  lien.Â  General accepted Scroggsâ€™ offer.Â  These assurances by Scroggs were followed \r\n  by letters.Â  The March 2, 2001, letter sent by Scroggs included the following \r\n  language:Â  â€œI would like to offer you my personal guarantee via this letter \r\n  for the money due.â€Â  It is signed by â€œRobert L. Scroggs, Jr./President.â€ Also, \r\n  the letter dated April 18, 2001, includes the following:Â  â€œPlease accept this \r\n  check and letter as my personal guarantee that all funds will be satisfied with \r\n  interest.â€Â  Again it is signed as â€œRobert L. Scroggs, Jr./President.â€ [1]   \r\nWe find, based on the evidence, including the language \r\n  used in the letters, the record supports the finding that Scroggs intended to \r\n  personally guarantee the debt of SMD to General.Â  While he signed the letters \r\n  as â€œPresident,â€ Scroggs explicitly stated it was a â€œpersonal guaranteeâ€ for \r\n  the debt.Â  Accordingly, we find no error in the trial judgeâ€™s determination \r\n  that Scroggs intended to personally guarantee the debt of SMD to General.\r\n\r\nB. Â Â Â Â  Consideration\r\n\r\nScroggs also maintains the personal guaranty \r\n  was invalid because there was no consideration. We disagree.\r\nâ€œA guaranty must be supported by sufficient legal \r\n  consideration, either a benefit to the principal obligor or guarantor on the \r\n  one hand, or some detriment to the obligee on the other.â€Â  Hope Petty Motors \r\n  of Columbia, Inc. v. Hyatt, 310 S.C. 171, 178, 425 S.E.2d 786, 791 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1992).Â  â€œA mere promise to pay the debt of another without any consideration \r\n  for such promise is void.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œValuable consideration may consist \r\n  of some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to one party or some forbearance, \r\n  detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other.â€ \r\n  McPeters v. Yeargin Constr. Co., 290 S.C. 327, 331, 350 S.E.2d 208, 211 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1986).Â  \r\nIn the instant case, Clark testified General agreed \r\n  to forego the filing of a mechanicâ€™s lien in exchange for the personal guarantee \r\n  by Scroggs.Â  Clark testified the conversation occurred in January 2001.Â  Additionally, \r\n  Algary testified conversations regarding payment began as early as December \r\n  2000.Â  The forbearance from filing the mechanicâ€™s lien by General was sufficient \r\n  consideration to support the personal guaranty from Scroggs.\r\nThere also exists some dispute as to whether the \r\n  timing of the alleged conversations and the written personal guaranty support \r\n  a finding that the forbearance from filing the mechanicâ€™s lien was sufficient \r\n  consideration.Â  The case was tried on the premise that the mechanicâ€™s lien was \r\n  required to be filedâ€”pursuant to South Carolina lawâ€”within ninety days of the \r\n  completion of the project.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-90 (Supp. 2004). [2] Â Â  The work on the project was completed in \r\n  late November 2000 according to all involved.Â  Therefore, the mechanicâ€™s lien \r\n  would need to have been filed no later than the latter part of February 2001 \r\n  or the beginning of March.Â  The first letter is dated March 2, 2001.Â  The subsequent \r\n  letter is clearly beyond the time for filing a mechanicâ€™s lien as it is dated \r\n  April 18, 2001.\r\nHowever, the testimony by Clark and Algary indicated \r\n  the agreement to provide the guaranty in exchange for forgoing their right to \r\n  file a mechanicâ€™s lien occurred in December 2000 or January 2001.Â  The acknowledgment \r\n  and ratification of the agreement occurred in the letters, which may be after \r\n  the filing date, but the actual agreement occurred within the time for filing \r\n  the lien.Â  Thus, there is some evidence to support the trial judgeâ€™s conclusion \r\n  that the agreement not to file a mechanicâ€™s lien was sufficient and valuable \r\n  consideration to support the personal guaranty from Scroggs.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe judgment of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  There is some discussion in the briefs regarding whether the \r\n    letters met the Statute of Frauds.Â  However, this issue was never raised to \r\n    the trial court and never ruled upon by the court.Â  Accordingly, it is not \r\n    preserved for our review on appeal.Â  See Wilder Corp. v.

Dudek, Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nDeputy Director for Legal Services Teresa A. Knox,.Legal Counsel Tommy Evans, Jr. \r\n  and Legal Counsel J. Benjamin Aplin, S.C. Dept. of Probation, all of Columbia, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this appeal, Esau Davis \r\n  argues the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to accept a guilty plea and revoke \r\n  his probation.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nIn August 2002, a Dorchester County grand \r\n  jury indicted Davis for throwing bodily fluids on a correctional facility employee.Â  \r\n  On November 19, 2002, Davis pled guilty to the charge and received a sentence \r\n  of three years suspended to three years probation.Â  Davisâ€™s probation was subject \r\n  to a number of conditions including that Davis would not change residences without \r\n  the consent of his agent, would pay a supervision fee, and that he would follow \r\n  the advice and/or instructions of his agent.Â  \r\nDavis was subsequently charged with violating \r\n  several conditions of his probation, including those outlined above. Â On February \r\n  24, 2003, Davis appeared at an administrative hearing to discuss the alleged \r\n  violations.Â  At the conclusion of the hearing, an administrative hearing officer \r\n  completed a report which found that Davis committed several violations of his \r\n  probation.Â  In the report, the hearing officer recommended a partial revocation \r\n  of Davisâ€™s probation for one year and screening for shock incarceration.Â  The \r\n  report also noted â€œFor Information Purposes Only: The Subject Has A Pending \r\n  Charge For Shoplifting 3rd.â€ Â \r\nOn April 24, 2003, Davis appeared for \r\n  a guilty plea/probation revocation hearing.Â  As the administrative hearing report \r\n  noted, Davis faced one count of shoplifting, his third offense.Â  While questioning \r\n  Davis during the plea proceeding, the court inquired as to whether he was aware \r\n  that a conviction on the shoplifting charge would violate his probation and \r\n  expose him to three years in prison.Â  Davis responded in the affirmative.Â  Ultimately, \r\n  the court accepted his guilty plea and imposed a sentence of thirty days with \r\n  credit for time served.Â  The court also revoked Davisâ€™s probation in accordance \r\n  with the administrative hearing officerâ€™s recommendation.Â  The shoplifting charge \r\n  was not a factor in the revocation of Davisâ€™s probation.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Davis argues his guilty \r\n  plea and probation revocation should be vacated because he â€œdid not waive grand \r\n  jury presentment in writing, and his probation was simultaneously revoked with \r\n  his guilty plea.â€Â  We disagree.\r\n In a criminal case, the circuit court has subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction to convict a defendant only if: â€œ(1) there has been an indictment \r\n  which sufficiently states the offense; (2) there has been a waiver of the indictment; \r\n  or (3) the charge is a lesser-included charge of the crime charged in the indictment.â€Â  \r\n  Cutner v. State, 354 S.C. 151, 155, 580 S.E.2d 120, 122 (2003).Â  Furthermore, \r\n  â€œ[t]he lack of subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time, can be \r\n  raised for the first time on appeal, and can be raised sua sponte \r\n  by the court.â€Â  State v. Guthrie, 352 S.C. 103, 107, 572 S.E.2d 309, \r\n  311 (Ct. App. 2002) (citing State v. Brown, 351 S.C. 522, 570 S.E.2d \r\n  559 (2002)).\r\nIn order for a defendant to waive presentment \r\n  of an indictment, such waiver must be in writing.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-23-130 \r\n  &amp; 140 (2003); State v. McNeil, 314 S.C. 473, 475, 445 S.E.2d 461, \r\n  462 (Ct. App. 1994); see also Summerall v. State, 278 S.C. \r\n  255, 294 S.E.2d 344 (1982) (holding failure to execute written waivers of presentment \r\n  rendered guilty pleas invalid).\r\nIn the present case, it could not be clearer \r\n  that Davis did execute a written waiver of presentment.Â  At the beginning of \r\n  the plea proceeding, the court inquired as to whether Davis was informed of \r\n  his right to have the matter submitted to a grand jury.Â  Davisâ€™s counsel answered \r\n  that he was so informed.Â  To further ensure Davis knew of his right to grand \r\n  jury presentment, the trial court provided Davis and defense counsel time to \r\n  discuss the issue.Â  After a brief recess, defense counsel explained, â€œIâ€™ve explained \r\n  to him his rights as to the grand jury; and he wishes to waive that right.â€Â  \r\n  The court went on to explain, in detail, the consequences of waiving presentment, \r\n  and Davis responded that he wished to â€œwaive the presentment and proceed here \r\n  today.â€Â  At this point, the following colloquy took place:\r\n\r\n The Court:Â  All right, Sir.Â  And [your intention \r\n  to waive presentment has] been indicated on the plea sheet where you have signed; \r\n  is that right?  [1] \r\n [Davis]:Â  Yes, Maâ€™am.\r\n The Court:Â  Very well.Â  So youâ€™ve indicated \r\n  both orally and in writing that intention; is that right?\r\n [Davis]:Â  Yes, Maâ€™am.\r\n\r\nBecause it is clear from the record \r\n  that Davis did properly waive presentment in writing, we find his argument to \r\n  be without merit.Â  We also note that the shoplifting charge was not a factor \r\n  the trial court used to revoke Davisâ€™s probation; thus, to the extent Davis \r\n  argues his probation revocation is invalid because of the alleged errors with \r\n  the shoplifting charge, we find this argument to be meritless as well.\r\nAFFIRMED.  \r\n  [2] \r\n HEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The â€œplea sheetâ€ is in the record, and Davisâ€™s signature is located \r\n    just below a box that is checked and reads â€œDefendant Waives Presentment to \r\n    Grand Jury.â€Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-120","title":"State v.

Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Gustavo Alvarado appeals his \r\n  conviction for trafficking in marijuana.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\n On December 13, 2001, Chris Hines, a deputy with \r\n  the Greenville County Sheriffâ€™s Department, was patrolling Interstate 85 looking \r\n  for instances of aggressive driving, such as following too closely, improper \r\n  lane changes, and various trucking violations.Â  During the early evening hours, \r\n  Hines noticed a 1997 dark maroon Honda Accord tailgating and drifting onto the \r\n  lane divider. This observation prompted Hines to follow the car, turn on his \r\n  in-car video camera, and call out a traffic stop with his dispatch. \r\nHines then stopped the car; however, because of \r\n  the heavy traffic on the highway, he went to the passenger side of the car and \r\n  requested the occupant in the front passenger seat to open the window.Â  When \r\n  the passenger opened the window about four or five inches, Hines immediately \r\n  detected an overwhelming odor of air freshener as well as a faint odor of raw \r\n  marijuana from inside the vehicle.\r\nAlvarado, who was driving the car, produced a driverâ€™s license.Â  \r\n  Following standard procedure, Hines further requested the vehicle registration \r\n  and insurance information.Â  After Alvarado produced these documents, Hines noticed \r\n  the proof of insurance had expired and instructed Alvarado to step to the rear \r\n  of the car.Â  \r\nHines then requested the passenger to look in \r\n  the glove box to locate current registration and insurance information on the \r\n  car.Â  Hines also asked the passenger his name and relationship to the driver.Â  \r\n  The passenger produced identification from a company in Delaware that gave only \r\n  his name.Â  He also stated he was â€œjust a friendâ€ and his date of birth was October \r\n  10, 1977. \r\nAfter calling dispatch to check for warrants on \r\n  both Alvarado and his passenger, Hines learned that Spartanburg County had an \r\n  active warrant for someone with the same name as the passenger but a date of \r\n  birth of September 15, 1981.Â  In addition, the passenger appeared to Hines to \r\n  be in his late teens.Â  Hines attempted to verify the passengerâ€™s age with Alvarado, \r\n  and based on what Alvarado told him, determined that the passenger may in fact \r\n  be the subject of the warrant.Â  Because of Hinesâ€™ concerns about the smells \r\n  emanating from the car and conflicting information from Alvarado about the passenger, \r\n  he kept Alvarado and the passenger separated and called for a backup as well \r\n  as a narcotics K-9 officer.Â  \r\nHines testified he gave Alvarado warning tickets \r\n  for following too closely and the lane change violation.Â  He further testified \r\n  that he asked Alvarado if there was marijuana in the car and Alvarado hung his \r\n  head and answered there was not.Â  In contrast, when Hines inquired about cocaine \r\n  in the car, Alvarado raised his head and denied it.Â  When Hines asked a second \r\n  time about marijuana, Alvarado denied it, but again hung his head and avoided \r\n  eye contact.Â  In addition, Alvarado refused to allow a search of the car, even \r\n  after Hines explained to him that as the driver, he had authority to consent.Â  \r\n\r\nWhen the backup officers arrived, the \r\n  passenger finally gave a correct date of birth matching what was on the warrant.Â  \r\n  In addition, Deputy Teddy Hampton with the K-9 unit testified that contrary \r\n  to the usual practice, his K-9 dog abruptly pulled him to the rear of the vehicle \r\n  and scratched the bumper to indicate it had found something. \r\n  [1] Â  \r\nUpon opening the trunk, Hines found \r\n  a U-Haul box.Â  When he pulled back one part of the lid of the box, he discovered \r\n  marijuana wrapped in brown packing tape.Â  Officers then placed Alvarado under \r\n  arrest.Â  \r\nIn addition to the U-haul box, officers \r\n  recovered a large garbage-style black plastic bag also contained marijuana.Â  \r\n  Inside this bag was a white trash bag with marijuana and several other smaller \r\n  bags or bundles of marijuana.Â  During a search of the interior compartments \r\n  of the car, officers found a set of scales used to weigh small items and a green \r\n  pipe with a drawing of a skull on it.Â  In addition, Hampton, who searched Alvarado \r\n  incident to his arrest, found a wad of cash on Alvaradoâ€™s person, which, Alvarado \r\n  said, was around $700 but actually turned out to be more than that amount.\r\nThe Greenville County grand jury indicted \r\n  Alvarado for the offense of trafficking in marijuana.Â  Following a jury trial \r\n  in November 2002, Alvarado was found guilty as charged and sentenced to serve \r\n  eighteen years and fined $15,000.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Alvarado argues the \r\n  trial court should have suppressed the drugs because the traffic stop was pretextual \r\n  and the stop and resulting search were therefore unlawful.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œIn an appeal from a motion \r\n  to suppress evidence based on Fourth Amendment grounds, an appellate court may \r\n  conduct its own review of the record to determine whether the evidence supports \r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s decision.â€ [2] Â  Nevertheless, in reviewing such \r\n  a motion on appeal, â€œthis court is bound by the circuit courtâ€™s factual \r\n  findings if any evidence supports the findings.â€ [3] Â  \r\nRegarding Alvaradoâ€™s contention \r\n  that the stop was pretextual, the trial court found that the stop was reasonable \r\n  and supported by probable cause and that Hinesâ€™ conduct was entirely appropriate \r\n  under the facts presented in this case.Â  We agree with the State that there \r\n  is evidence in the record to support these findings. \r\n  [4] Â  Hines testified he observed the Honda Accord only about one car length \r\n  behind the vehicle in front of it while traveling at about sixty miles per hour.Â  \r\n  He further stated that such a following distance was grossly inadequate under \r\n  the standards of the National Traffic Safety Administration. \r\n  [5] Â  \r\nWe also find no merit to \r\n  Alvaradoâ€™s argument that the marijuana should have been suppressed because Hines \r\n  did not have a reasonable suspicion to further detain him after giving him traffic \r\n  violation warnings.Â  \r\nIn support of \r\n  his argument that he was unlawfully detained, Alvarado cites State v. Williams \r\n  [6]  for the proposition that after the stop has been completed, further \r\n  detention is improper.Â  In our view, although Williams limits what a \r\n  police officer can do after a routine traffic stop, the case expressly allows \r\n  further detention for questioning after the stop is completed if â€œthe officer \r\n  has a reasonable suspicion of a serious crime.â€ \r\n  [7] \r\nIn this case, Hines stated \r\n  he smelled the air freshener and the marijuana before he issued the traffic \r\n  warning to Alvarado.Â  He further testified he became concerned that Alvaradoâ€™s \r\n  passenger might have been the subject of an outstanding warrant.Â  In addition, \r\n  as noted by the trial court, the conflicting stories that Alvarado and his passenger \r\n  gave to Hines constituted an additional factor that when considered with the \r\n  other suspicious circumstances, would lead to an articulable suspicion of criminal \r\n  activity.\r\n2.Â  We disagree with Alvaradoâ€™s contention that \r\n  the chain of custody for the marijuana found in the car was not sufficiently \r\n  established to admit the drugs into evidence. [8] Â  \r\nâ€œThe admission of evidence is discretionary with \r\n  the trial judge.â€ [9] Â  â€œProof of chain of custody need \r\n  not negate all possibility of tampering but must establish a complete chain \r\n  of evidence as far as practicable.â€ [10] Â  â€œ[I]f the identity of each person in the \r\n  chain handling the evidence is established, and the manner of handling is reasonably \r\n  demonstrated, no abuse of discretion is shown in the admission, absent proof \r\n  of tampering, bad faith, or ill-motive.â€ \r\n  [11] Â  Furthermore, â€œwhere there is a weak link in the chain of custody, \r\n  as opposed to a missing link, the question is only one of credibility and not \r\n  admissibility.â€ [12] \r\nIn the present case, Hines testified that after \r\n  he seized the bags of marijuana, he listed them on the property report and secured \r\n  them with evidence tape.Â  Tony Vinskus, the supervisor over the property and \r\n  evidence section, testified that narcotics must be submitted to his division \r\n  in tamper-proof, sealed packaging.Â  Vinskus also testified that when contraband \r\n  is received, trained personnel witness the drop being made and the evidence \r\n  remains in a locked dropbox until it is processed into evidence storage.Â  As \r\n  to the one individual who handled the evidence before it was analyzed but was \r\n  not called as a witness at trial, Vinskus testified about that employeeâ€™s responsibilities \r\n  and the procedures she followed in carrying out her duties.Â  We have found no \r\n  evidence suggesting this individual did not follow established protocol, and \r\n  Alvarado does not direct our attention to anything in the record showing her \r\n  work on the case deviated from standard procedure. [13] \r\n3.Â  Finally, we reject Alvaradoâ€™s argument that he \r\n  should have received a directed verdict because the evidence was insufficient \r\n  to support a finding that he had dominion and control over the marijuana.\r\nAny person â€œwho is knowingly in actual \r\n  or constructive possessionâ€ of ten pounds or more of marijuana is guilty of \r\n  trafficking in marijuana. [14] Â  \r\n  â€œTo prove constructive possession, the State must show a defendant had dominion \r\n  and control,â€ over the contraband. \r\n  [15] Â  â€œConstructive possession can be established by circumstantial as \r\n  well as direct evidence, and possession may be shared.â€ \r\n  [16] Â  â€œThe knowledge element may be proved circumstantially by evidence \r\n  of acts, declarations, or conduct of the accused from which an inference may \r\n  be drawn that the accused knew of the existence of the prohibited substance.â€ [17] Â  â€œBecause actual knowledge of the presence \r\n  of the drug is strong evidence of intent to control its disposition or use, \r\n  knowledge may be equated with or substituted for the intent element.â€ \r\n  [18] \r\nIn support of his argument, Alvarado emphasizes \r\n  that the vehicle that he was driving belonged to his brother and he had merely \r\n  borrowed it to give his cousin, Ricardo Gallegos, a ride.Â  He also notes that \r\n  Gallegos testified at trial that Alvarado was unaware of and had nothing to \r\n  do with the marijuana seized in the present case, which was found in a closed \r\n  container in the trunk of the car.Â  \r\nWe, however, hold the record has sufficient \r\n  evidence that would support a finding by the jury that Alvarado had at least \r\n  the right to exercise dominion and control over the drugs.Â  It is undisputed \r\n  that Alvarado was driving the car when it was stopped; therefore, it is reasonable \r\n  to infer that he had dominion and control over â€œpremises upon which the drugs \r\n  were found.â€ [19] Â  And this is not the only evidence that supports \r\n  Alvaradoâ€™s conviction.Â  Alvaradoâ€™s behavior during the traffic stop, including \r\n  his refusal to make eye contact when asked if he had marijuana and the vague \r\n  answers he gave to questions regarding the circumstances of his journey, could \r\n  be considered indicative of his participation in criminal activity and of his \r\n  awareness that he had been caught with contraband.Â  He also had over $700 in \r\n  cash on his person when he was arrested.Â  Moreover, during the trial, Gallegos \r\n  admitted to owning only the pipe that was seized from the car, which could support \r\n  an inference that the scales belonged to Alvarado.Â  In addition, the excessive \r\n  amount of air freshener in the car was susceptible of the inference that the \r\n  occupants were attempting to mask the pungent smell of the marijuana, which, \r\n  despite this effort, was of such a quantity that it emanated an odor that was \r\n  detected almost immediately by both the arresting officer and the K-9 dog.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  Hampton stated that he usually started the dog from the front of \r\n    the car and worked backwards.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  State v.

Sowell, of Greenville, pro se, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John M. McIntosh, Chief, State Grand Jury, Sherri A. Lydon, and Assistant \r\n  Attorney General Jennifer D. Evans, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Kenneth Sowell appeals the \r\n  circuit courtâ€™s order finding him in criminal contempt for disclosing grand \r\n  jury information subject to a protective order.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe State Grand Jury conducted an investigation \r\n  into a methamphetamine ring in Greenville, Greenwood, and Laurens counties.Â  \r\n  As a result of this investigation, the grand jury â€œtrue-billedâ€ an indictment \r\n  against Bobby Joe Lewis for trafficking and conspiracy to traffic methamphetamine.Â  \r\n  After being charged, Lewis hired Sowell to represent him on the charges.Â  Sowell \r\n  came into contact with Lewis through Kenneth Curtis, who was also a target of \r\n  the investigation and previously a client of Sowell.Â  According to Curtis, \r\n  he paid Sowell to represent Lewis with the understanding that if Lewis intended \r\n  to â€œflip,â€ Sowell would let him know. \r\nIn the course of his representation of Lewis, Sowell \r\n  requested that the Attorney Generalâ€™s office provide him with information that \r\n  was part of the grand jury investigation.Â  Because the Legislature has \r\n  deemed this information to be secret, its dissemination is governed by the provisions \r\n  of section 14-7-1720 of the South Carolina Code of Laws.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1720(A) \r\n  (Supp. 2004) (â€œState grand jury proceedings are secret, and a state grand juror \r\n  shall not disclose the nature or substance of the deliberations or vote of the \r\n  state grand jury.â€); see Anderson v. State, 338 S.C. 629, 632, \r\n  527 S.E.2d 398, 399 (Ct. App. 2000) (recognizing this stateâ€™s long-held policy \r\n  regarding the secrecy surrounding grand jury proceedings).Â  \r\nPursuant to this statute, the Attorney General \r\n  â€œmay not disclose the testimony of a witness examined before a state grand jury \r\n  or other evidence received by it except when directed by a court for the purpose \r\n  of . . . providing the defendant the materials to which he is entitled pursuant \r\n  to Section 14-7-1700.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1720(A)(4)(Supp. 2004); see \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1700 (Supp. 2004) (â€œSubject to the limitations of Section \r\n  14-7-1720(A) and (D) and Rule 5, South Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure, \r\n  a defendant has the right to review and to reproduce the stenographically or \r\n  electronically recorded materials.â€).Â  â€œIf the court orders disclosure of matters \r\n  occurring before a state grand jury, the disclosure must be made in that manner, \r\n  at that time, and under those conditions as the court directs.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 14-7-1720(A) (Supp. 2004).\r\nIn this case, the judge issued a protective order \r\n  that permitted the dissemination of the grand jury information to Sowell, but \r\n  imposed certain conditions on the disclosure.Â  The order provides in relevant \r\n  part:\r\n\r\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Attorney General is protected \r\n  if he chooses to disclose to the attorneys for the defendants in the above-captioned \r\n  cases testimony taken in the State Grand Jury and interviews of witnesses and \r\n  other documents which must subsequently be disclosed under normal circumstances \r\n  at trial.Â  It is understood that the State Grand Jury material is being provided \r\n  only for purposes of the trial of the above-captioned cases.Â  The attorney for \r\n  the defendants and the defendants are bound by the secrecy provisions of Â§ 14-7-1720.\r\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ \r\n  14-7-1700 and â€“1720(A) (Law. Co-op. 1976), the defendants and their attorneys \r\n  are prohibited from photocopying any State Grand Jury testimony, interviews \r\n  of witnesses and any other documents that may be disclosed to the defendants \r\n  and their attorneys in reference to the above-captioned case.Â  All such materials \r\n  shall be completely destroyed at the conclusion of the case.Â  \r\nNothing in this Order prohibits the defendants or their attorneys \r\n  from using Brady material for purposes of preparing for trial.\r\n\r\nThe relevant materials were made available to Sowell \r\n  after the protective order was signed.Â  Sowell admits the information was shared \r\n  with Gene Gore, a private investigator Sowell had employed numerous times.Â  \r\n  Sowell testified he informed Gore that the information he was sharing with him \r\n  could not be given to anyone and the documents must be kept â€œunder lock and \r\n  key at all times.â€\r\nSignificantly, Gore also sold used cars, and Kenneth \r\n  Curtis had previously purchased five or six cars from him.Â  It was ultimately \r\n  revealed that Curtis paid Gore for his investigative services.Â  A portion of \r\n  the evidence subject to the court order led to another member, Floyd Ballew, \r\n  of the methamphetamine ring who implicated Curtis.Â  Gore found Ballew and had \r\n  him sign an affidavit to this affect.Â  Gore then used this affidavit to confront \r\n  Curtis in an attempt to acquire information.Â  \r\nThis disclosure of information by Gore to Curtis \r\n  was revealed when Curtis was caught on a confidential informantâ€™s tape stating \r\n  he was aware he was the subject of the State Grand Jury investigation.Â  Based \r\n  on this information, the State filed a motion for Sowell to show cause why he \r\n  was not guilty of criminal contempt. \r\nAfter a hearing, the trial judge found Sowell guilty \r\n  of criminal contempt of court for willfully disclosing information subject to \r\n  a protective order.Â  Specifically, the judge held the State â€œclearly established \r\n  that [Sowell] was not directed by the Court to release this information to Gore \r\n  nor did he explain the secrecy requirement of the Protective Order.â€Â  The \r\n  judge sentenced Sowell to ninety days imprisonment suspended upon the payment \r\n  of a $5,000 fine within ninety days.Â  Subsequently, Sowell filed a motion for \r\n  reconsideration.Â  The judge denied this motion, but reduced the amount \r\n  of the fine to $2,500. Â \r\nSowell appeals his conviction of criminal contempt \r\n  of court.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA determination of contempt ordinarily resides \r\n  in the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Whetstone v. Whetstone, \r\n  309 S.C. 227, 233, 420 S.E.2d 877, 880-81 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  â€œThis court will \r\n  reverse a trial courtâ€™s decision regarding contempt only if it is without evidentiary \r\n  support or is an abuse of discretion.Â Â  An abuse of discretion can occur where \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law.â€Â  First Union Natâ€™l \r\n  Bank v. First Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. of South Carolina, 346 S.C. \r\n  462, 466, 551 S.E.2d 301, 303&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001) (citations omitted).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nSowell argues the circuit court judge erred in \r\n  finding him in criminal contempt. \r\n  [1] Â  He contends he was permitted to reveal grand jury information to his \r\n  investigator and, thus, there was no evidence to support the judgeâ€™s decision.Â  \r\n  We disagree. \r\nâ€œThe power to punish for contempt is inherent in \r\n  all courts and is essential to the preservation of order in judicial proceedings.â€Â  \r\n  In re Diggs, 344 S.C. 434, 434, 544 S.E.2d 632, 632&nbsp;(2001).Â  A courtâ€™s \r\n  contempt power arises when an individual willfully disobeys an order of the \r\n  court.Â  Id.Â  â€œA willful act is defined as one â€˜done voluntarily and intentionally \r\n  with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, or with the specific \r\n  intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done; that is to say, \r\n  with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.â€™â€Â  Spartanburg County \r\n  Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872, 874 \r\n  (1988) (quoting Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1434 (5th ed. 1979)).Â  â€œIntent \r\n  for purposes of criminal contempt is subjective, not objective, and must necessarily \r\n  be ascertained from all of the acts, words and circumstances surrounding the \r\n  occurrence.â€ State v. Bevilacqua, 316 S.C. 122, 129, 447 S.E.2d 213, \r\n  217 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  \r\nHowever, â€œ[o]ne may not be convicted of contempt \r\n  for violating a court order which fails to tell him in definite terms what he \r\n  must do.â€Â  Welchel v. Boyter, 260 S.C. 418, 421, 196 S.E.2d 496, 498 \r\n  (1973).Â  In a criminal contempt proceeding, the State has the burden of proving \r\n  the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  State v. Bowers, \r\n  270 S.C. 124, 131, 241 S.E.2d 409, 412 (1978).Â  â€œ[B]efore a person may be held \r\n  in contempt, the record must be clear and specific as to acts or conduct upon \r\n  which such finding is based.â€Â  State v. Harper, 297 S.C. 257, 258, 376 \r\n  S.E.2d 272, 274 (1989).Â Â  \r\nAs a threshold matter, we note that Sowell neither \r\n  challenges the validity of the order nor the application of section 14-7-1720 \r\n  to him. [2] Â  Therefore, we do not analyze this issue.Â  \r\n  Instead, he admits disclosure of the material to his investigator, but claims \r\n  this disclosure did not violate the protective order. \r\nSection 14-7-1700 grants a defendant the right \r\n  to review and reproduce grand jury material.Â  This right is limited by the strictures \r\n  of sections 14-7-1720(A) and (D), as well as Rule 5 of the South Carolina Rules \r\n  of Criminal Procedure.Â  Section 14-7-1720(A) requires that the disclosure to \r\n  the defendant â€œmust be made in that manner, at that time, and under those conditions \r\n  as the court directs.â€Â  By the terms of the order, the judge imposed on Sowell \r\n  the same secrecy provisions that are applicable to the Attorney General under \r\n  section 14-7-1720(B). [3] Â  Therefore, if Sowell intended \r\n  to disclose this information to Gore in order to prepare an adequate defense \r\n  for Lewis, he was bound by the mandatory language of section 14-7-1720(B)(2), \r\n  which provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nThe Attorney General or his designee promptly shall provide \r\n  the presiding judge before whom was impaneled the state grand jury whose material \r\n  has been disclosed, the names of the persons to whom the disclosure has been \r\n  made, and shall certify that he has advised these persons of their obligation \r\n  of secrecy under this section.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§14-7-1720 (B)(2) (Supp. 2004). [4] Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Applying these provisions to the instant case, \r\n  we hold the judgeâ€™s decision was not based on an error of law given he relied \r\n  on the appropriate legal standards for a finding of contempt.Â  In determining \r\n  Sowell willfully violated the protective order, the judge found the State presented \r\n  clear and specific evidence of Sowellâ€™s conduct and that Sowell was guilty beyond \r\n  a reasonable doubt.\r\nFurthermore, the trial judge sat as the trier of \r\n  facts.Â  Thus, based on our limited standard of review, we will not disturb his \r\n  findings unless they are without evidentiary support.Â  We find there is evidence \r\n  to support the judgeâ€™s ruling.Â  First, there is no dispute that Sowell failed \r\n  to inform the court that he disclosed the grand jury material to Gore until \r\n  prompted by the Stateâ€™s motion for a rule to show cause.Â  In terms of the second \r\n  requirement under section 14-7-1720(B)(2), the judge concluded Sowell failed \r\n  to explain to Gore the obligation of secrecy.Â  In support of this ruling, the \r\n  judge implicitly rejected the testimony of Sowell and, instead, found Gore and \r\n  Curtis to be credible witnesses.Â  We give due deference to the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  consideration of credibility matters.Â  See Cherry v. Thomasson, \r\n  276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981) (On appeal, this court is not \r\n  required to ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, \r\n  was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative \r\n  weight to their testimony.).Â  \r\nIn his findings of fact, the judge stated Gore \r\n  testified, â€œhe was not given any instruction regarding the release of this information \r\n  to any other individuals from the Defendant.â€Â  Additionally, â€œGore admits that \r\n  the information contained in this material was related to Mr. Kenny Curtis.â€Â  \r\n  As to Curtis, the judge found that â€œCurtis testified that he was kept apprized \r\n  throughout this investigation of the material that pertained to him and paid \r\n  Gore five thousand dollars ($5,000) to act as a private investigator for the \r\n  Defendant.â€Â  These findings are supported by the testimony of Gore and \r\n  Curtis.Â  Based on the specific facts of this case and our limited standard of \r\n  review, we hold the judge did not abuse his discretion in finding Sowell in \r\n  criminal contempt of the protective order.Â  \r\n This decision should not be interpreted \r\n  to mean that a defense attorney is precluded from disclosing state grand jury \r\n  material to his or her staff or investigator.Â  This position, which the State \r\n  appeared to advocate at oral argument, would put defense counsel at a disadvantage \r\n  in that it would severely limit counselâ€™s ability to prepare an adequate defense.Â  \r\n  However, if disclosure is permitted then defense counsel must abide by the conditions \r\n  imposed by a court pursuant to section 14-7-1720(A).Â  By requiring defense counsel \r\n  to proceed through the proper channels, similar to the State, the court will \r\n  be able to preserve the sanctity of grand jury material.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the circuit court judgeâ€™s \r\n  finding of criminal contempt is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  We note Sowell raises five separate issues in his brief.Â  Because \r\n    all of the issues challenge the finding of contempt, we have consolidated \r\n    them in the interest of clarity.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â Â  The plain language of section 14-7-1720 applies only to jurors, \r\n    individuals involved in the state grand jury process, and law enforcement \r\n    personnel who are entitled to the information under subsection (B) based on \r\n    their assistance to the Attorney General.Â  Therefore, the secrecy provisions \r\n    of section 14-7-1720 would not apply to Sowell unless the judge, as in this \r\n    case, limited the use of the information pursuant to the courtâ€™s power to \r\n    condition the disclosure of information.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1720 (A) (Supp. \r\n    2004).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Â Â  In the protective order, the judge only generally referenced the \r\n    secrecy provisions of section 14-7-1720.Â  However, in the contempt \r\n    order, the judge specifically relied on subsection A when he concluded that \r\n    Sowell failed to obtain prior approval of the court before disclosing the \r\n    information.Â  The judge also implicitly relied on subsection B in finding \r\n    that Sowell failed to explain to Gore the secrecy requirement of the protective \r\n    order.Â  The judgeâ€™s reliance on subsection A would appear to be inapplicable \r\n    to Sowell given that subsection controls the initial disclosure to the Attorney \r\n    General and forms the basis for the protective order.Â  Based on our review \r\n    of section 14-7-1720, we believe the procedure governing Sowellâ€™s disclosure \r\n    of the grand jury information was controlled by section 14-7-1720(B)(2), which \r\n    does not require prior approval of the court.Â Â  This error, as will be discussed, \r\n    does not affect our ultimate decision.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4] Â Â  We note that the language of our state statute is similar to that \r\n    of Rule 6(e)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.Â  See State \r\n    v. Follin, 352 S.C. 235, 246, 573 S.E.2d 812, 817 (Ct. App. 2002) (â€œFederal \r\n    Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) is very similar to our statute regarding disclosure \r\n    of secret information to subsequent grand juries.â€).Â Â Â  Despite the fact that \r\n    our statute tracks the language of the federal rule, our research has not \r\n    revealed any federal case law that provides definitive guidance on the issue \r\n    presented in this appeal.Â  See Sara Sun Beale, et al., Grand \r\n    Jury Law and Practice Â§5:7 (2d ed. 2003), available in Westlaw, \r\n    GRJURLAW (â€œIn particular, it is not clear whether [Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(i)] permits \r\n    the attorney to make further disclosures of the grand jury materials to others.â€); \r\n    Id. (â€œ[T]he courts are not likely to accept any argument that disclosures \r\n    to private investigators assisting the prosecutors with a criminal case would \r\n    be permitted under the â€˜performance of dutiesâ€™ clause since the same disclosure \r\n    would be barred by the more specific subsection of the Rule that governs disclosures \r\n    to agents assisting the government in the criminal case.Â  By contrast, a prosecutorâ€™s \r\n    disclosure of grand jury materials to his secretary, paralegal, or law clerk \r\n    would be regarded as routine disclosure closely tied to the prosecutorâ€™s role \r\n    in conducting the grand jury proceeding and any subsequent criminal action.â€); \r\n    1 Charles Alan Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure Â§ 107, at 398-400Â  \r\n    (3d ed. 1999) (â€œ[M]achinery has now been provided by which federal prosecutors \r\n    can utilize, without a court order, other government personnel.Â  The government \r\n    personnel to whom grand-jury material is disclosed under this provision cannot \r\n    use the material in a manner that would not be permissible for the government \r\n    attorney himself.â€).Â  Given the divergent views analyzing this issue and the \r\n    fact that Sowell does not challenge the validity of the protective order, \r\n    we have chosen not to establish a bright line rule for a defense attorneyâ€™s \r\n    disclosure of grand jury information.Â  Instead, we limit our review of this \r\n    issue by applying the facts of the instant case to our state statutory language \r\n    within the context of our limited standard of review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-123","title":"Wells Fargo Bank v.

Todd, both of Columbia, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; This appeal \r\n  arises from an order allowing foreclosure on a piece of real property but not \r\n  on a mobile home located on that property.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1996, Denise Gardner acquired sole \r\n  ownership of a mobile home that she placed on a piece of vacant real estate \r\n  in Lugoff.Â  Both Denise and her mother, Peggy Luther, had an ownership interest \r\n  in the real estate. [1] Â  Peggy moved into the mobile \r\n  home with Denise after Denise was involved in an automobile accident.Â  \r\nWhile Peggy was living with Denise, an \r\n  agent of Approved Federal Savings Bank (â€œBankâ€) contacted Peggy offering to \r\n  consolidate her various debts by refinancing her real property.Â  Peggy agreed \r\n  and understood the consolidation transaction was going to be a refinance on \r\n  her property.Â  Pursuant to section 37-10-102(a) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. \r\n  2003), the Bank provided Peggy with a notice that explained she could choose \r\n  her own closing attorney and insurance agent.Â  Because Peggy indicated she had \r\n  no preference in legal counsel, Brett F. Kline was chosen by the Bank and served \r\n  as Peggyâ€™s counsel.Â  Kline met with Peggy twice in her home during this transaction.Â  \r\n\r\nIn order to effectuate the refinancing, \r\n  Denise signed a limited warranty deed on September 3, 1999, conveying her interest \r\n  in the real estate to Peggy, such that Peggy would become the sole owner of \r\n  the real estate.Â Â  While the face of the deed did not purport to transfer the \r\n  mobile home, the legal description of the deeded property which was contained \r\n  on a separate paper and attached to the deed, included a statement that the \r\n  transfer included all improvements on the real estate and â€œthat it is the borrowerâ€™s \r\n  intent that the mobile home loses its nature as personalty and becomes realty.â€Â  \r\n\r\nPeggy also executed a promissory \r\n  note in favor of the Bank [2]  \r\n  for $65,500 on that same day.Â  The promissory note was secured by a mortgage \r\n  on the real estate.Â Â  The legal description of the mortgaged property also stated \r\n  that the transfer included all improvements and â€œthat it is the borrowerâ€™s intent \r\n  that the mobile home loses its nature as personalty and becomes realty.â€Â  Peggy \r\n  also executed an â€œAffixation Affidavit Regarding Manufactured Home,â€ and a manufactured \r\n  housing rider to the mortgage, in which Peggy attested to the permanent affixation \r\n  of the mobile home to the real estate.Â  \r\nPeggy testified that she was seventy \r\n  years old, did not necessarily understand what she was signing, did not finish \r\n  the ninth grade, and was in poor health.Â  Peggy also testified that at the time \r\n  she signed these papers, she believed that the land and the mobile home belonged \r\n  to her daughter, Denise.Â  During Peggyâ€™s deposition, Peggy represented that \r\n  she knew she was signing the papers in order to have the â€œtrailer refinanced,â€ \r\n  but that she did not and never had owned the mobile home.Â  Peggyâ€™s deposition \r\n  testimony also revealed that she acknowledged signing the papers, but no one \r\n  was there to witness her signature.Â  Peggy testified that her attorney, Kline, \r\n  told her â€œnot to worry about it, that he was going to take it back to the office, \r\n  and get somebody to witness it there.â€Â  The documents revealed Robert V. Harrelson \r\n  to be the subscribing witness.Â  \r\nDenise testified that it was never her \r\n  intent to transfer the mobile home to her mother, and that she told Kline that \r\n  she would not sign anything that could ever cause her to lose her mobile home.Â  \r\n  Denise also testified that she thought her mother was borrowing money on the \r\n  land and not the mobile home.Â  The loan proceeds were used to pay off Peggyâ€™s \r\n  medical bills and to pay off money Denise owed on the mobile home.Â  \r\nOn December 1, 2000, Peggy defaulted \r\n  on the promissory note and mortgage.Â  The Bank brought a declaratory judgment \r\n  action seeking a determination that the mobile home was subject to the mortgage \r\n  and an action for foreclosure of the mortgage.Â  The case was transferred to \r\n  the master-in-equity.Â  \r\nThe master issued an order on February \r\n  11, 2004, finding that each page of the mortgage was initialed by Peggy except \r\n  the legal description, â€œwhich was prepared and attached to the document after \r\n  the execution of the Mortgage and was never presented to or reviewed by Peggy.â€Â Â  \r\n  The master also found, in relevant part, that (1) the deed and mortgage were \r\n  not properly witnessed, (2) the mortgage was invalid as a legal mortgage, (3) \r\n  the deed failed to transfer title to the mobile home to Peggy, (4) the Bank \r\n  failed to perfect a lien on the mobile home, (5) the failure to perfect was \r\n  fatal to the Bankâ€™s claim that it was entitled to foreclose on the mobile home \r\n  as an improvement located on the real property, and (6) the Bank was entitled \r\n  to foreclose pursuant to an equitable mortgage against the real estate only.Â  \r\n  The Bank appeals the masterâ€™s failure to include the mobile home in the equitable \r\n  mortgage. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œActions for foreclosure or the cancellation \r\n  of instruments are actions in equity.â€Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 324 S.C. \r\n  570, 576-77, 479 S.E.2d 510, 513&nbsp;(1996).Â  Since the master-in-equity heard \r\n  this equitable action without appeal to the circuit court, the appellate court \r\n  may find the facts on appeal in accordance with its own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.Â  Id.Â  However, the appellate court should not disregard \r\n  the findings of the master who saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better \r\n  position to judge their credibility.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Bankâ€™s sole argument on appeal \r\n  is that the master erred in concluding that the mobile home was not a fixture \r\n  and not subject to the equitable mortgage.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe Bank argues that it was the intent \r\n  of the parties to subject the mobile home to the equitable mortgage and permanently \r\n  affix the mobile home to the real estate.Â  In making this argument, the Bank \r\n  asserts the master erred in making certain findings of fact.Â  First, the Bank \r\n  alleges the master erred in omitting from the order the fact that the legal \r\n  description of the deeded property included the mobile home.Â  Second, the Bank \r\n  alleges that the master erred in finding the legal description, which included \r\n  the mobile home, was prepared and attached to the mortgage and deed after \r\n  Peggy signed the papers.Â  Third, the Bank argues the master erred in finding \r\n  that Denise testified â€œthe mobile home at no time was to be transferred or included \r\n  in the contemplated loan.â€Â  We disagree and find that the facts, in accordance \r\n  with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence, support the order of \r\n  the master-in-equity.\r\nInitially, we find the Bankâ€™s equitable \r\n  mortgage did not extend to the mobile home.Â  For an equitable lien to arise, \r\n  there must be a debt owing from one person to another; specific property to \r\n  which the debt attaches; and an intent, expressed or implied, that the property \r\n  will serve as security for the payment of the debt.Â  First Federal Sav. and \r\n  Loan Assâ€™n of Charleston v. Bailey,&nbsp; 316 S.C. 350, 356, 450 S.E.2d \r\n  77, 80-81&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1994). If a mortgage is actually signed by the mortgagor \r\n  and intended to secure the debt, it can be treated as an equitable mortgage. \r\n  See Stelts v. Martin, 90 S.C. 14, 16-17, 72 S.E.2d 550, 551 (1911);Â  \r\n  Bryce v. Massey, 35 S.C. 127, 142, 14 S.E. 768, 774 (1892).\r\nIn this case, there is no doubt that Peggy \r\n  owes a debt to the Bank.Â  Moreover, it is uncontested that Peggy sought to secure \r\n  the debt with her real estate.Â  However, we do not find that Denise or Peggy \r\n  intended for the mobile home to serve as security.Â  The Bank does not appeal \r\n  from the masterâ€™s finding that the deed purporting to transfer the mobile home \r\n  from Denise to Peggy was invalid.Â  This unappealed ruling becomes the law of \r\n  the case and precludes consideration of the validity of the deed on appeal.Â  \r\n  See ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche,&nbsp; \r\n  327 S.C. 238, 241, 489 S.E.2d 470, 472&nbsp;(1997).Â  As a result, Peggy never \r\n  had an ownership interest in the mobile home to subject to a mortgage.Â  Cf. \r\n  McDavid v. McDavid,&nbsp;187 S.C. 127, 139, 197 S.E. 204, 209&nbsp;(1938) \r\n  (â€œIf one has a legal right to sell land, he would likewise have the right to \r\n  mortgage it.â€).Â  \r\nTherefore, we must look to the intent of \r\n  Denise, as sole and exclusive owner of the mobile home, to see if she entered \r\n  into any transaction that would subject her mobile home to the Bankâ€™s equitable \r\n  mortgage.Â  Denise, however, owes no debt to the Bank.Â  The debt owed to the \r\n  Bank is owed solely by Peggy.Â  While Denise signed a deed that purported to \r\n  transfer her interest in the mobile home to her mother, this deed was found \r\n  to be invalid.Â  See ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P.,&nbsp; 327 S.C. \r\n  at 241, 489 S.E.2d at 472.Â  Moreover, the legal description of the deeded property \r\n  included improvements and a statement â€œthat it is the borrowerâ€™s intent that \r\n  the mobile home loses its nature as personalty and becomes realty.â€Â  This legal \r\n  description was never signed or initialed by Denise, nor does it evince Deniseâ€™s \r\n  intent; rather, it merely expresses Peggyâ€™s intent as â€œborrower.â€Â Â  \r\nAlthough the Bank asserts that the parties \r\n  were represented by attorney Kline, implying that Denise knew the legal description \r\n  on the deed included the mobile home and reflected her intent to transfer interest \r\n  in the mobile home, the record does not reflect that attorney Kline represented \r\n  Deniseâ€™s interests.Â Â Â  Rather, the record demonstrates that Kline was hired \r\n  to represent Peggyâ€™s interests and served as Peggyâ€™s legal counsel.Â  \r\nDenise expressed her intent to remain the \r\n  owner of the mobile home to Kline and testified that she thought her mother \r\n  was borrowing money on the land.Â  Thus, we find Denise did not intend to secure \r\n  Peggyâ€™s debt with her mobile home and as a result, the equitable mortgage was \r\n  properly limited to the real estate.Â  \r\nAdditionally, we find the mobile home \r\n  was not a fixture to the real estate and thus not subject to the equitable mortgage.Â  \r\n  A mobile home is generally classified as personal property, such that a security \r\n  interest may be perfected by listing the interest on the certificate of title.Â  \r\n  Brockbank v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 379, 534 S.E.2d 688, 692&nbsp;(2000).Â  \r\n  However, a mobile home may cease being personal property by annexation to real \r\n  estate and may be sold with the real estate.Â  Id.Â Â  In such a case, the \r\n  mobile home is considered a fixture and may be subject to any mortgage on the \r\n  real estate.Â Â  See In re Rebel Mfg. And Mktg. Corp., 54 B.R. 674 \r\n  (Bankr. D.S.C. 1985); Gilbert v. Easterling, 217 S.C. 267, Â­Â­275, 60 \r\n  S.E.2d 595, 597 (1950).Â  \r\n A mobile home does not become a fixture \r\n  by mere affixation to realty.Â  City of North Charleston v. Claxton, 315 \r\n  S.C. 56, 62-63, 431 S.E.2d 610, 614&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1993).Â  â€œCriteria for determining \r\n  whether personalty becomes a fixture when affixed to realty includes: (1) the \r\n  mode of attachment; (2) the character of the structure of the article; (3) the \r\n  intent of parties making the annexation; and (4) the relationship of the parties.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  \r\nIn this case, the relationship of the \r\n  parties is clear: Peggy and Denise are mother and daughter and the Bank is the \r\n  lender.Â  With respect to the mode of attachment and the character of the structure, \r\n  Denise testified that the mobile home is a rectangular doublewide, set up in \r\n  two sections and fastened together.Â  She stated:Â  â€œThe tires donâ€™t come with \r\n  it, but itâ€™s all set up where they just put the tires back under it.Â  I mean, \r\n  itâ€™s movable.â€ Denise further explained:Â  â€œThe tongue is laying right up under \r\n  it.Â  All it takes is bolts to put it up.â€Â  \r\nAt issue is the intent of the parties \r\n  making the annexation.Â  There is evidence that Peggy and the Bank intended the \r\n  mobile home to be a fixture.Â  Peggy signed a deed and mortgage containing a \r\n  legal description stating that it was the borrowerâ€™s intent to treat the mobile \r\n  home as a fixture and part of the real estate.Â  In addition, Peggy signed an \r\n  affidavit stating that the mobile home was permanently affixed to the real estate \r\n  and a rider in which she promised that the mobile home would be permanently \r\n  affixed.Â  Furthermore, she purported to grant the Bank a security interest in \r\n  the mobile home.Â  \r\nAt most, these documents evidence \r\n  Peggyâ€™s and the Bankâ€™s intention to treat the mobile home as a fixture but do \r\n  not suggest Denise, as rightful owner of the mobile home, had a similar intent.Â  \r\n  Although Denise signed the deed, she did not initial the legal description, \r\n  which stated that the transfer included all improvements and that the borrower \r\n  intended to treat the mobile home as a fixture.Â  Nothing in the legal description \r\n  suggests Denise intended to treat the mobile home as a fixture.Â Â  \r\nMoreover, we decline to give substantial \r\n  weight to the documents considering the circumstances under which they were \r\n  signed. [3] Â  Peggy explained that the Bank \r\n  contacted her and offered her a loan.Â  She stated that she was seventy years \r\n  old, did not necessarily understand what she was signing, did not finish the \r\n  ninth grade, and was in poor health.Â  Peggyâ€™s attorney was chosen by the lender, \r\n  did not leave copies of the documents with Peggy, failed to have the documents \r\n  properly witnessed, and was hired to represent the interests of Peggy and not \r\n  Denise.Â  Neither Peggy nor Denise signed or initialed the legal description, \r\n  which purported to include the mobile home in the deed and mortgage and purported \r\n  to state Peggyâ€™s intent to treat the mobile home as a fixture.\r\nPeggy testified that she believed that \r\n  the land and the mobile home belonged to her daughter, Denise, but represented \r\n  that she knew she was signing the papers in order to have the â€œtrailer refinanced.â€Â  \r\n  Denise, on the other hand, never intended to for her mother to secure the loan \r\n  with the mobile home or forfeit ownership of the home.Â  \r\nBased on these facts, we find \r\n  the mobile home did not become a fixture by its mere annexation to the real \r\n  estate subject to the equitable mortgage.Â  Rather, the evidence suggests that \r\n  the mobile home was readily movable and the parties did not intend to permanently \r\n  annex the home to the real estate.Â  As a result, the master did not err in concluding \r\n  that the mobile home was not a fixture and not subject to the equitable mortgage.\r\nFinally, the Bank argues the master erred \r\n  in finding it was estopped from including the mobile home in the mortgage because \r\n  the deed failed to transfer title to the mobile home to Peggy.Â Â  The Bank asserts \r\n  that the statutes setting forth the procedure for transferring a mobile home \r\n  in addition to real estate were not in effect at the time the deed was executed \r\n  and therefore not applicable to the transaction.Â  This argument was never raised \r\n  to or ruled upon by the master-in-equity, and is not preserved for our review.Â  \r\n  See Holy Loch Distrib., Inc. v. Hitchcock, 340 S.C. 20, 24, 531 \r\n  S.E.2d 282, 284 (2000).Â  Furthermore, the masterâ€™s order did not find that the \r\n  Bank was estopped from including the mobile home in the mortgage.Â  Rather, the \r\n  order determined that the mobile home was not permanently affixed to the property, \r\n  was not contemplated in the loan, was not transferred by deed to Peggy, and \r\n  was not subject to the lien because the Bank failed to perfect by listing the \r\n  interest on the certificate of title.Â  Therefore, we decline to address this \r\n  issue on appeal. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause we find the master correctly \r\n  concluded that the mobile home was not a fixture and not subject to the equitable \r\n  mortgage, the order of the master-in-equity is hereby \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The partiesâ€™ briefs clarify that Denise and Peggy owned the real \r\n    estate as tenants in common.Â  The description of the real estate attached \r\n    to the mortgage and deed explains that it was conveyed to Peggy and Denise \r\n    by deed in November of 1998.Â  Peggy testified that the property was her daughterâ€™s \r\n    property, but â€œ[i]t ended up in my name somehow.â€Â  The final order describes \r\n    Deniseâ€™s interest as an â€œundivided one-half (1/2) interest.â€Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Approved Federal Savings Bank subsequently assigned \r\n    the note and mortgage to Appellant, Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  The Bank seems to argue, pursuant to the parol evidence rule, that \r\n    we are bound to consider only the documents as evidence of the partiesâ€™ intent.Â  \r\n    However, the parol evidence rule only applies to the construction of written \r\n    agreements.Â  See Redwend Ltd. Partnership v. Edwards,&nbsp; \r\n    354 S.C. 459, 471, 581 S.E.2d 496, 502&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003) (â€œThe parol evidence \r\n    rule prevents the introduction of extrinsic evidence of agreements or understandings \r\n    contemporaneous with or prior to execution of a written instrument when the \r\n    extrinsic evidence is to be used to contradict, vary, or explain the written \r\n    instrument.â€).Â  In this case, we are not construing a written agreement, but \r\n    determining the extent of an equitable mortgage and fashioning a remedy in \r\n    equity.Â  Thus, we are not bound by the parole evidence rule. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-124","title":"Noris v.

Poliakoff, of Spartanburg, and M. Celia Robinson, \r\n  of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nW. Francis Marion, Jr., of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHUFF, J.: Â Keisha Norris, sister \r\n  of the deceased, Tony Woodward, appeals the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment \r\n  to Allstate Insurance Company from an action for declaratory judgment as to \r\n  whether Allstate provided insurance coverage for a shooting incident resulting \r\n  in Tony Woodwardâ€™s death.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn June 1999, Ricky Hull, a passenger \r\n  in an automobile operated by Roshaun Hall, shot and killed Tony Woodward, a \r\n  pedestrian walking down a street in Spartanburg County.Â  The vehicle driven \r\n  by Roshaun Hall was insured by Allstate Insurance Company.Â  Ricky Hull subsequently \r\n  pled guilty to murder, while Hall pled guilty to assault with intent to kill.Â  \r\n\r\nNorris, Woodwardâ€™s sister, brought this \r\n  declaratory judgment action to determine whether the Allstate policy on Hallâ€™s \r\n  vehicle covered the incident.Â  Both parties filed motions for summary judgment.Â  \r\n  The trial court, relying on State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co. v. Bookert, \r\n  337 S.C. 291, 523 S.E.2d 181 (1999), granted Allstateâ€™s motion for summary judgment \r\n  finding the incident was not â€œforeseeably identifiable with the normal use of \r\n  an automobile.â€Â  The court further found the insuring language in the policy \r\n  that included â€œloading or unloadingâ€ of the insured vehicle did not apply to \r\n  provide coverage as there was no evidence an accident occurred when the vehicle \r\n  was being loaded or unloaded.Â  The trial court subsequently denied Norrisâ€™ motion \r\n  for reconsideration.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n Norris argues Woodwardâ€™s \r\n  injuries were sustained while the insured vehicle was being put to the normal \r\n  and foreseeable use of transportation, and the vehicle was an active accessory \r\n  to the injuries such that coverage from the policy applies under South Carolina \r\n  law.Â  We disagree.\r\nThis case is controlled \r\n  by our Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Bookert, \r\n  337 S.C. 291, 523 S.E.2d 181 (1999).Â  In reversing this courtâ€™s decision finding \r\n  coverage, the Supreme Court in Bookert determined injuries to Bookertâ€™s \r\n  son were not â€œforeseeably identifiable with the normal use of an automobileâ€ \r\n  where the assailant shot Bookertâ€™s son from an automobile as her son was about \r\n  to enter a restaurant.Â  The Supreme Court noted the following stipulated facts \r\n  in Bookert:\r\n\r\nMaryâ€™s son, respondent Michael \r\n  Bookert, is an insured under Maryâ€™s policy.Â  Michael and some friends stopped \r\n  at a Hardeeâ€™s, where two soldiers and about fifteen other young men became involved \r\n  in an altercation.Â  Michael and his friends left and went to a McDonaldâ€™s, as \r\n  did some of the fifteen men from Hardeeâ€™s.Â  The two soldiers, who were armed, \r\n  picked up a third soldier and drove to the McDonaldâ€™s where they circled the \r\n  parking lot, looking for the Hardeeâ€™s men.Â  As Michael was about to go in the \r\n  restaurant, he heard the soldiers yelling, and turned in their direction.Â  The \r\n  soldiersâ€™ vehicle was stopped in the traffic lane with its motor running, one \r\n  soldier in the back holding a shotgun while the front passenger brandished a \r\n  handgun.Â  The vehicle jerked forward, the soldier wielding the shotgun fell, \r\n  and fired his gun.Â  Michael was not hit by the shotgun pellets, but while the \r\n  vehicle was still moving forward, the passenger fired the handgun striking Michael \r\n  with a bullet in each leg.\r\n\r\nId. at 292-93, 523 S.E.2d \r\n  at 181-82.Â  \r\nNorris attempts to distinguish \r\n  Bookert from the facts of this case asserting that in Bookert, \r\n  the car was stopped with its engine running and the only movement of the vehicle \r\n  came when the car â€œjerkedâ€ at which point shots were fired.Â  Thus, Norris contends \r\n  the transportation requirement was not met in Bookert, accounting for \r\n  the courtâ€™s determination that there was no coverage.Â  We first note that the \r\n  Supreme Court did not rely on the transportation requirement in Bookert, \r\n  but instead relied on the foreseeability factor in denying coverage.Â  At any \r\n  rate, the stipulated facts in Bookert do not indicate the vehicle was \r\n  stopped when Bookertâ€™s son was shot.Â  To the contrary, the court clearly stated \r\n  Bookertâ€™s son was shot â€œwhile the vehicle was still moving forward.â€Â  Because \r\n  we can discern no material distinction from the facts at hand and the facts \r\n  in the Bookert case, we find no error in the trial judgeâ€™s determination \r\n  there was no coverage because the incident was not â€œforeseeably identifiable \r\n  with the normal use of an automobile.â€\r\nNorris also claims that the trial court erred in \r\n  granting summary judgment because the policy in question covered â€œloading and \r\n  unloadingâ€ of a vehicle, thereby expanding the coverage to include the negligent \r\n  loading of dangerous passengers.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Allstate policy provides coverage for â€œclaims \r\n  for accidents arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use, loading or unloading \r\n  of an insured auto.â€Â  Norris argues that Hall was negligent or reckless in â€œloadingâ€ \r\n  Hull as a passenger when he had knowledge that Hull had dangerous propensities \r\n  and the trial court therefore erred in granting summary judgment to Allstate.Â  \r\n  We refuse to accept this illogical construction.Â  Woodward was not injured by \r\n  any activity that occurred during the actual loading or unloading of Hull, nor \r\n  was he injured as a result of any activity necessary or integral to the loading \r\n  or unloading of Hull.Â  See Home Indem.

Ins. \r\n  Co., 252 S.C. 452, 457, 166 S.E.2d 819, 822 (1969) (where a policy includes \r\n  a loading and unloading provision, the â€œcomplete operationâ€ doctrine provides \r\n  the test to determine whether unloading has commenced is whether the acts in \r\n  progress at the time of the accident were necessary and integral to the movement \r\n  of goods from the vehicle, whether they would have occurred but for the need \r\n  to move the goods, and whether they were closely related in time and space to \r\n  the actual movement of goods from the vehicle).Â  Further, even though the â€œloading \r\n  and unloadingâ€ provision is an expansion of coverage, coverage is still only \r\n  expanded to â€œclaims for accidents arising out of . . . loading or unloading \r\n  of an insured auto.â€Â  Such a negligent loading theory as advocated by Norris \r\n  â€œgloss[es] over the critical causal relation test.â€Â  Nationwide Mut. Ins. \r\n  Co. v. Brown, 779 F.2d 984, 988 (4th Cir. 1985).Â  The accident \r\n  upon which insurance coverage is claimed must bear a causal relation or connection \r\n  with the loading or unloading of the insured automobile.Â  Here, there simply \r\n  is no such connection.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the trial \r\n  court granting summary judgment to Allstate is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nCURETON, AJ., concurs.\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  Although I agree with the majorityâ€™s \r\n  finding that we are bound by the holding in State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance \r\n  v. Bookert, 337 S.C. 291, 523 S.E.2d 181 (1999), I write separately to express \r\n  some concerns regarding the similarities in this case to valid prior caselaw.\r\nIn Wausau Underwriters Insurance Company \r\n  v. Howser, 309 S.C. 269, 422 S.E.2d 106 (1992), the victimâ€™s car was bumped \r\n  and she was eventually shot by an unknown driver of another car.Â  In answering \r\n  a question certified from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth \r\n  Circuit, our state supreme court found a causal connection, holding the victimâ€™s \r\n  injuries arose out of the use of the assailantâ€™s vehicle:Â  â€œOnly through use \r\n  of his vehicle was the assailant able to closely pursue Howser, thereby enabling \r\n  him to carry out the pistol assault.Â  The gunshot was the culmination of an \r\n  ongoing assault, in which the vehicle played an essential and integral part.â€Â  \r\n  Howser, 309 S.C. at 273, 422 S.E.2d at 108.\r\nOur state supreme court similarly found \r\n  a causal connection in Home Insurance Company v. Towe, 314 S.C. 105, \r\n  441 S.C.2d 825 (1994).Â  In that case, the passenger in Toweâ€™s moving car threw \r\n  a bottle at a road sign and inadvertently struck the victim on his tractor.Â  \r\n  Our state supreme court determined there was a causal connection between the \r\n  use of Toweâ€™s automobile and the victimâ€™s injuries:Â  â€œThe use of the automobile \r\n  placed Alexander in the position to throw the bottle at the sign and the vehicleâ€™s \r\n  speed contributed to the velocity of the bottle increasing the seriousness of \r\n  McCaskeyâ€™s injuries.â€Â  Towe, 314 S.C. at 107, 441 S.E.2d at 827.\r\nI am unable to distinguish the facts of \r\n  the present case from Howser and Towe.Â  The victim in the present \r\n  case was pursued and shot by assailants in a moving vehicle.Â  The vehicle played \r\n  an â€œessential and integral partâ€ of the assault, allowing the assailants to \r\n  closely pursue the victim.Â  I find Bookert to be in conflict with Howser \r\n  and Towe.Â  Absent Bookert, I would be inclined to find there was \r\n  a â€œcausal connectionâ€ between the use of the vehicle and the shooting of the \r\n  victim because the use of the vehicle played such an integral role in this case.Â  \r\n  The Bookert court found that the gun shot injuries were not foreseeably \r\n  identifiable with the normal use of the vehicle.Â  Bookert, 337 S.C. at \r\n  293, 523 S.E.2d at 182.Â  Since the decision in Bookert (1999), it is \r\n  arguable that drive-by shootings are foreseeably identifiable with the normal \r\n  use of a vehicle. [1] Â  The use \r\n  of a motor vehicle is a necessary part of a drive-by shooting.\r\nUntil our Supreme Court overrules Howser, \r\n  we must assume that the fact that an assailant fired a gun from an automobile \r\n  does not automatically defeat coverage by the automobileâ€™s insurer.Â  Although \r\n  it is certainly arguable that today, drive-by shootings are foreseeably identifiable \r\n  with the normal use of an automobile, I nevertheless believe this court is bound \r\n  by the finding in Bookert of no causal connection.Â  Accordingly, I concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  According to unofficial data from SLED, drive by shootings in South \r\n    Carolina have increased from 2 in 1999 to 41 in 2003 (the latest figures available).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-125","title":"May v.

Donohoe, of Hilton Head Island, for Appellant.Â  \r\nNo appearance by or for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  John May appeals the order \r\n  of the special referee, arguing he erred in dismissing Mayâ€™s breach of contract \r\n  action and his quantum meruit and negligence claims.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nMay, an interior decorator, \r\n  and Nancy Hopson entered into a series of three separate oral agreements in \r\n  connection with the decoration of Hopsonâ€™s new house.Â  Under the terms of their \r\n  first agreement, Hopson agreed to pay May $75 per hour plus a 15% commission \r\n  on the purchase price of furniture and art he selected.Â  Hopson paid the only \r\n  two invoices May submitted, which totaled $3200.Â  \r\nThe parties then entered \r\n  into a second oral agreement whereby May continued decorating Hopsonâ€™s house \r\n  at no charge and, in turn, Hopson agreed to allow May to utilize her house as \r\n  a showcase for his prospective clients.Â  Pursuant to their agreement, Hopson \r\n  also provided May with office space and administrative support for his decorating \r\n  business, at no charge.Â  This second agreement did not include a fee arrangement, \r\n  and May made no demands for payment for his continued services as Hopsonâ€™s personal \r\n  decorator.Â  \r\nFinally, the parties entered \r\n  into a third oral agreement to jointly provide decoration and design services \r\n  for a model home built by a third party.Â  Under the terms of this agreement, \r\n  May and Hopson would share equally in both the cost of purchasing furniture \r\n  and accessories, and in any profits realized upon a sale.Â  When the furniture \r\n  and accessories failed to sell, disputes arose between the parties concerning \r\n  who was responsible financially.Â  Eventually, Hopson removed furniture and accessories \r\n  from the model house.Â  May demanded Hopson return the items to him and pay him \r\n  an additional $93,000 in compensation and unpaid commissions for design work \r\n  he allegedly performed on her home pursuant to the first agreement.Â  Hopson \r\n  refused.\r\nMay sued, alleging breach \r\n  of contract, quantum meruit, and conversion, and the case was referred to a \r\n  special referee.Â  May amended his complaint to allege breach of contract, breach \r\n  of contract accompanied by fraudulent acts, unjust enrichment, and negligence.Â  \r\n  Hopson answered and counterclaimed for breach of the partnership agreement and \r\n  unjust enrichment.Â  \r\nThe parties agreed to reserve \r\n  Mayâ€™s negligence cause of action until Hopsonâ€™s counsel could determine whether \r\n  her homeownerâ€™s insurance would pay for repairs.Â  If the claims remained unresolved \r\n  after 90 days, the referee announced he would hold a separate hearing on the \r\n  issue of Hopsonâ€™s alleged negligent care of the furniture.Â  Consequently, no \r\n  testimony on this issue was taken at trial.Â  At the close of Mayâ€™s case, the \r\n  referee directed a verdict for Hobson on Mayâ€™s claim for breach of contract \r\n  accompanied by a fraudulent act.Â  In the final order, the referee dismissed \r\n  Mayâ€™s remaining causes of action, including his negligence claim.Â  The referee \r\n  also dismissed Hopsonâ€™s counterclaims, deeming them abandoned.Â  \r\nMay filed a motion to amend, \r\n  arguing the referee improperly dismissed his negligence cause of action after \r\n  expressly reserving the issue at trial for later determination, and requested \r\n  the case be reopened to allow testimony on his claim.Â  In his amended order, \r\n  the referee agreed the negligence claim should not have been dismissed and deleted \r\n  the portion of his order dismissing that claim.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n May contends \r\n  the special referee erred in dismissing his breach of contract claim, arguing \r\n  the referee relied on inadmissible hearsay as the sole basis of determining \r\n  the partiesâ€™ relative contributions to partnership debts.Â  We disagree.\r\nMay misapprehends \r\n  the essential nature of the refereeâ€™s report.Â  Although billed as an action \r\n  in quantum meruit, the issue before the court was closely akin to an accounting \r\n  of a partnership, and the referee hinged his final ruling on the factual finding, \r\n  â€œHopson fully accounted for and showed the expenditures on Agreement No. 3 were \r\n  equal and that neither party was owed any money by the other.â€Â  The referee \r\n  further found that Agreement No. 2 superseded Agreement No. 1, and that both \r\n  parties fulfilled their obligations under both agreements Nos. 1 and 2.Â  These \r\n  rulings have not been appealed, and they are therefore the law of the case.Â  \r\n  Charleston Lumber Co. v. Miller Housing Corp., 338 S.C. 171, 175, 525 \r\n  S.E.2d 869, 871 (2000) (stating an unappealed ruling is the law of the case.).Â  \r\n\r\nAs a consequence, the only \r\n  issue remaining before the special referee, and before us on this appeal, is \r\n  the dispute between the parties as to their financial responsibility under Agreement \r\n  No. 3.Â  In making his finding that the expenditures pursuant to Agreement No. \r\n  3 were equal, the special referee referenced an exhibit he had previously ruled \r\n  could only be marked for identification and not considered as evidence. [2] Â  Although the referee improperly \r\n  referenced an exhibit not in evidence, his mistake is not fatal to his finding \r\n  that Hopson fulfilled her obligations under the partnership agreement.Â  Hopson \r\n  testified the excluded document was merely an itemized summary of figures she \r\n  supplied to her accountant drawn from her own records and personal knowledge.Â  \r\n  She also testified to the accuracy and proper allocation of the amounts summarized.Â  \r\n  Moreover, based on her testimony of the expenses she paid, the special referee \r\n  could conclude Hopson contributed at least 50% of the cost of furniture purchased \r\n  for the model home project.Â  Accordingly, we find there is ample evidence contained \r\n  in Hopsonâ€™s testimony to support a finding she contributed an equal if not greater \r\n  share toward satisfying partnership debt.Â  Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., \r\n  301 S.C. 229, 237, 391 S.E.2d 538, 543 (1989) (stating that in an action in \r\n  equity tried by the judge alone, this court can make findings of facts in accordance \r\n  with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  However, this does \r\n  not require us to ignore the fact that the special referee was in a better position \r\n  to assess the credibility of the witnesses.).\r\nNext, May contends the special \r\n  referee erred in dismissing his quantum meruit claim, arguing Hopson has been \r\n  unjustly enriched because she has not sufficiently compensated him for decorating \r\n  and design services he undertook at her house.Â  May urges the $3200 he received, \r\n  based on his own submitted invoices, under the partiesâ€™ first agreement and \r\n  the rent-free office space and administrative services he received under the \r\n  second agreement are grossly inadequate compensation.Â  He now insists the invoices \r\n  he submitted covered only an initial 40 hours of work at Hopsonâ€™s house and \r\n  that he is owed for thousands of subsequent man hours and a 15% commission on \r\n  nearly a quarter of a million dollars in furniture and art acquisitions for \r\n  her residence.Â  We disagree.\r\nOnly under the terms of \r\n  the defunct first agreement was May entitled to hourly fees and commissions \r\n  on purchases and improvements for Hopsonâ€™s home.Â  The refereeâ€™s unappealed finding \r\n  that neither party had any further obligation to the other under Agreement No. \r\n  1 disposes of any contention May is entitled to further compensation therefor.Â  \r\n\r\nFinally, May requests that \r\n  we remand the issue of the negligence cause of action with instructions to the \r\n  referee to hold a hearing and render a decision on this issue.Â  We find it unnecessary \r\n  to remand for that purpose.\r\nIt was agreed between the \r\n  parties that any negligence claim would be bifurcated, and the dismissal of \r\n  that claim in the original order was clearly an oversight that was corrected \r\n  pursuant to the motion for reconsideration.Â  Therefore, that issue is not a \r\n  subject of this appeal and may be set for a hearing upon the request of either \r\n  party.Â  See Rule 205, SCACR (â€œNothing in these Rules shall prohibit the \r\n  lower court, commission or other tribunal from proceeding with matters not affected \r\n  by the appeal.â€).Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule \r\n    215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  The exhibit, referred to in the final order as â€œDefendantâ€™s \r\n    Exhibit #15,â€ is a summary of expenses incurred and payments made by both \r\n    parties for furnishings purchased for the model home.Â  It was prepared by \r\n    Hopsonâ€™s accountant, at her direction, and based solely upon information she \r\n    provided.Â  At trial, the referee sustained Mayâ€™s objection to the introduction \r\n    of the exhibit.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-126","title":"Milton v.

Jahue Moore, of West Columbia, for Appellants.\r\nMichael Parham and William L. Dodson, Jr., both of Greenville, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this medical malpractice \r\n  action, the trial court granted Robbie Miltonâ€™s motion for voluntary dismissal \r\n  without prejudice.Â  Doctors Glen F. Strickland and James D. Givens, and their \r\n  surgical group, Southern Surgical Group, LLC, (collectively â€œDefendantsâ€) appeal, \r\n  arguing the dismissal causes them legal prejudice and is against public policy.Â  \r\n  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nIn August 2003, Milton filed a \r\n  complaint against Defendants in Lexington County, alleging medical malpractice.Â  \r\n  In paragraph two of the complaint, Milton stated that â€œ[u]pon information and \r\n  belief, these Defendants are citizens and residents of the County of Lexington, \r\n  State of South Carolina.â€ In Defendantsâ€™ answer, they admitted the allegations \r\n  set forth in paragraph two of Miltonâ€™s complaint.Â  Because all Defendants resided \r\n  in Lexington County when this action commenced, South Carolinaâ€™s general venue \r\n  statute required Milton to bring suit there.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-7-30 (1976).\r\nSimultaneous to serving the complaint \r\n  on Defendants, Milton also served upon them a series of written interrogatories.Â  \r\n  In response to the interrogatories, Defendants submitted Dr. Stricklandâ€™s Curriculum \r\n  Vitae.Â  On his Curriculum Vitae, Dr. Stricklandâ€™s home address and \r\n  his childrenâ€™s names were blacked out.Â  The blacking out of Dr. Stricklandâ€™s \r\n  address piqued Miltonâ€™s interest, and he hired a private investigator to explore \r\n  the issue of Dr. Stricklandâ€™s residence.Â  After reviewing tax, driverâ€™s license, \r\n  and voter registration records, the private investigator filed an affidavit \r\n  with the court, which indicated that Dr. Strickland was actually a resident \r\n  of Richland County, South Carolina when the medical malpractice action was commenced.\r\nOnce this information was discovered, Milton moved \r\n  for a voluntary dismissal without prejudice pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2), SCRCP, \r\n  so that he could re-file his claim in Richland County.Â  The trial court granted \r\n  Miltonâ€™s motion, and this appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA plaintiff is ordinarily entitled to \r\n  a voluntary non-suit without prejudice as a matter of right unless the defendant \r\n  shows legal prejudice or important issues of public policy are present.Â  Burry \r\n  &amp; Son Homebuilder, Inc. v. Ford, 310 S.C. 529, 531, 426 S.E.2d 313, \r\n  314 (1992).Â  â€œOnce legal prejudice is found, the granting or denial is within \r\n  the discretion of the trial court.â€Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDefendants first argue the trial court abused its \r\n  discretion because it granted Miltonâ€™s motion for voluntary dismissal without \r\n  prejudice based on a mistaken belief that every plaintiff has an absolute right \r\n  to one voluntary dismissal.Â  Defendants argue that because the trial court failed \r\n  to consider whether legal prejudice would result or whether public policy concerns \r\n  would be implicated, the court committed reversible error.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo support their argument, Defendants \r\n  quote from the transcript of the hearing in which the trial court orally ruled \r\n  that â€œthe law is clear.Â  To me.Â  As I understand . . . I always give them one \r\n  bite at the apple.Â  Which I think 41(a)(2) gives them . . . .â€Â  While this isolated \r\n  statement might suggest the trial court did not consider whether the voluntary \r\n  dismissal would contravene public policy or whether it would cause legal prejudice \r\n  to Defendants, the transcript as a whole belies that implication.Â  Both attorneys \r\n  discussed the proper standard in their presentations to the trial court, and \r\n  the trial court even took a moment to read a case presented by the Defendantsâ€™ \r\n  attorney.Â  \r\nMore importantly, the trial courtâ€™s written order \r\n  specifically acknowledges that â€œ[a] plaintiff generally has the right to voluntarily \r\n  dismiss his claim without prejudice absent some â€˜legalâ€™ prejudice demonstrated \r\n  by the Defendant or some public policy issue of great import.â€Â  It is well-settled \r\n  that no order is final until it is written and entered.Â  Rule 58(a), SCRCP; \r\n  see also First Union Natâ€™l Bank of S.C. v. Hitman, Inc., 308 S.C. \r\n  421, 422, 418 S.E.2d 545, 545 (1992) (â€œ[A] judge is not bound by the prior oral \r\n  ruling and may issue a written order which is in conflict with the oral ruling.â€).Â  \r\n  Thus, we find the trial court considered the correct standard when it granted \r\n  Miltonâ€™s motion to voluntarily dismiss his claim without prejudice.\r\nNext, Defendants argue the trial court erred in \r\n  granting Miltonâ€™s motion for a voluntary dismissal without prejudice because \r\n  they demonstrated that such a dismissal would legally prejudice them and would \r\n  contravene public policy.Â  Specifically, Defendants argue that once venue was \r\n  laid in Lexington County, it cannot be moved to Richland County without depriving \r\n  Dr. Givensâ€™ of his substantial right to defend the action in the county of his \r\n  residence.Â  Defendants further argue that because Milton seeks a dismissal so \r\n  he can re-file in Richland County, Milton is forum-shopping, a practice that \r\n  is repugnant to the public policy of South Carolina.Â Â Â  We disagree.\r\nDefendants argue the case of Â  Burry \r\n  &amp; Son Homebuilder, Inc. v. Ford, 310 S.C. 529, 531, 426 S.E.2d 313, \r\n  314 (1992), supports their argument that once venue was established in Lexington \r\n  County, dismissal for the purpose of allowing Milton to re-file in Richland \r\n  would amount to legal prejudice for Dr. Givens.Â  We do not believe the law set \r\n  forth in Burry is applicable to the factual circumstances of this case.\r\nIn Burry, a homebuilder filed a \r\n  complaint against a homeowner for breach of contract.Â  The homeowner answered, \r\n  arguing that the homebuilder was not entitled to enforce the contract because \r\n  he was not a licensed residential builder.Â  Thereafter, the homeowner sought \r\n  to amend his answer to assert a counterclaim for damages resulting from the \r\n  homebuilderâ€™s defective workmanship.Â  The homeowner also moved for summary judgment.Â  \r\n  In support of his motion, the homeowner submitted an affidavit from an investigator \r\n  for the South Carolina Residential Buildersâ€™ Commission who confirmed the homebuilder \r\n  was not licensed.Â  In response, the homebuilder filed a motion for a voluntary \r\n  dismissal without prejudice.Â  Id. at 530, 426 S.E.2d at 314.Â  The trial \r\n  court denied the homebuilderâ€™s motion for voluntary dismissal, finding that \r\n  legal prejudice would result if the homeowner had to bring his counterclaim \r\n  to the county of the homebuilderâ€™s residence.Â  Id. at 531, 426 S.E.2d \r\n  at 314.Â  On appeal, the supreme court affirmed, finding â€œthe loss of proper \r\n  venue in oneâ€™s county of residence suffices to establish legal prejudice.â€Â Â  \r\n  Id.\r\nUnlike the Burry case, there are \r\n  multiple defendants in this case.Â  Here, even assuming some degree of legal \r\n  prejudice would result from Dr. Givensâ€™ losing his ability to defend himself \r\n  in the county in which he resides, such prejudice would be offset by the opportunity \r\n  Dr. Strickland is afforded now that he is able to defend himself in his county \r\n  of residence.Â  Furthermore, the case before us does not involve a counterclaim.Â  \r\n  Thus, there is no danger that Defendants will lose their right to bring a counterclaim \r\n  in their county of residence as was the concern in Burry.Â Â  \r\nFurthermore, we agree with the trial court \r\n  that this action is in an early enough stage of litigation that dismissing the \r\n  case would not cause legal prejudice to Defendants. Â At this point, only minimal \r\n  discovery has been exchanged and no depositions have been taken. Â Cf. \r\n  Crout v. S.C. Natâ€™l Bank, 278 S.C. 120, 293 S.E.2d 422 (1982) (finding \r\n  legal prejudice when the plaintiffâ€™s motion for voluntary dismissal was announced \r\n  only five days before trial and plaintiff had no compelling reason for making \r\n  the motion).Â  Moreover, to the extent that the passage of time might affect \r\n  legal prejudice, we note that if Defendants had not admitted in their answer \r\n  that Dr. Strickland lived in Lexington County, Milton could have immediately \r\n  sought to have the case voluntarily dismissed or to have venue changed.Â  Likewise, \r\n  if the city and state of Dr. Stricklandâ€™s residence had not been blacked out \r\n  on his Curriculum Vitae, Milton could have taken immediate action.Â  Instead, \r\n  months had to pass for Milton to hire an investigator and discover Dr. Stricklandâ€™s \r\n  true county of residence.Â  While the Defendantsâ€™ errors may have been innocent, \r\n  their mistakes did extend the time between Miltonâ€™s complaint and his motion \r\n  for voluntary dismissal. \r\n Furthermore, under the circumstances of \r\n  this case, we disagree with Defendantsâ€™ argument that allowing Milton to re-file \r\n  in Richland County would condone forum shopping.Â  This is not a situation where \r\n  Milton is attempting to join a sham defendant for the sheer purpose of acquiring \r\n  a more plaintiff-friendly venue.Â  Rather, Milton is merely attempting to file \r\n  his medical malpractice action in a county in which he could have filed had \r\n  he known from the outset where Dr. Strickland lived.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 15-7-30 (1976) (setting forth the rule that certain actions, such as medical \r\n  malpractice, â€œshall be tried in the county in which the defendant resides at \r\n  the time of the commencement of the action,â€ and â€œ[i]f there be more than one \r\n  defendant then the action may be tried in any county in which one or more of \r\n  the defendants to such action resides at the time of the commencement of the \r\n  actionâ€).Â  \r\n Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s grant of \r\n  Miltonâ€™s motion for a voluntary dismissal without prejudice is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-127","title":"State v.

Jonas, of Beaufort, for Appellant.\r\nJames A. Grimsley, III and Ralph E. Tupper, both of Beaufort, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Nancy Jonas appeals \r\n  a circuit order denying her motion to dismiss.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nIn January 2003, Jonas filed a motion \r\n  to dismiss in the Beaufort County Circuit Court, apparently with the intention \r\n  of having a judgment entered against her in 1996 dismissed.Â  A hearing on the \r\n  motion was scheduled for 10 a.m. on September 15, 2003.Â  Jonas was advised of \r\n  the date and time of the hearing, and informed the court that she was ready \r\n  to proceed.\r\nThe hearing was called at the scheduled \r\n  time, but Jonas was not present.Â  The court placed a call to her residence and, \r\n  after failing to reach her, left a message reminding her of the hearing.Â  As \r\n  of 10:30 a.m., Jonas had still not appeared.Â  The circuit court denied the motion \r\n  for lack of prosecution and ordered the â€œcase ended.â€\r\nAfter contact from Jonas later that afternoon, \r\n  the circuit court allowed her to file a motion to reconsider the denial of her \r\n  motion.Â  Following reconsideration, the circuit court again denied Jonasâ€™s motion \r\n  to dismiss.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nANALYSIS\r\nJonas argues the trial court erred \r\n  in denying her motion due to, among other things, a vast conspiracy of corruption \r\n  and collusion involving this stateâ€™s circuit and appellate courts and Discount \r\n  Auto Center.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs Jonasâ€™s present appeal and underlying \r\n  motion attempt to retry issues previously resolved and not properly before the \r\n  circuit court, we briefly re-cap this caseâ€™s procedural history.Â  In 1996, Discount \r\n  Auto Center obtained a judgment against Jonas in magistrateâ€™s court for nonpayment \r\n  of a bill arising from work done to her vehicle.Â  In 1997, Jonas appealed the \r\n  judgment to the circuit court, which affirmed the magistrateâ€™s decision.Â  She \r\n  then appealed the circuit courtâ€™s decision to this court.Â  Her appeal was dismissed \r\n  as untimely.Â  This court did, however, grant Jonas leave to petition the trial \r\n  court for relief from judgment pursuant to Rule 60, SCRCP.Â  Jonas filed this \r\n  motion in the magistrateâ€™s court, but specifically requested in the petition \r\n  that the motion not be decided until future matters concerning her appeal were \r\n  resolved.Â  Following the resolution of various motions regarding her appeal \r\n  in this court (e.g. a petition to reinstate), a writ of certiorari was filed \r\n  with the state supreme court.Â  This petition was denied in September 1998.Â  \r\n  Following this courtâ€™s issuance of remittitur, Jonas filed a motion in the state \r\n  supreme court to recall the remittitur.Â  This motion was likewise denied.Â  She \r\n  then appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which finally dismissed her \r\n  case on December 3, 1999.\r\nMore than three years after the United \r\n  States Supreme Court dismissed her appeal, Jonas filed the present motion, styled \r\n  oddly as a â€œmotion to dismiss.â€Â  Nevertheless, a hearing was scheduled on the \r\n  matter.Â  Jonas was properly notified, but did not appear for the hearing.\r\nA trial judge possesses the inherent power \r\n  to dismiss actions sua sponte for a partyâ€™s failure to prosecute \r\n  with due diligence.Â  Crestwood Golf Club, Inc. v. Potter, 328 S.C. 201, \r\n  211-212, 493 S.E.2d 826, 832 (1997); Small v. Mungo, 254 S.C. 438, 442-443, \r\n  175 S.E.2d 802, 803-804 (1970).Â  On appeal, Jonas raises several matters regarding \r\n  the substance of her long-resolved case, but only addresses her absence from \r\n  the hearing by vaguely referencing some alleged filings with our stateâ€™s supreme \r\n  court.Â  The only evidence in the record of any attempted availment of our supreme \r\n  courtâ€™s original jurisdiction is dated January 1999, more than three years prior \r\n  to the scheduled hearing.Â  As Jonas is challenging the trial courtâ€™s denial \r\n  of her motion, she bears the burden on appeal of producing a record sufficient \r\n  to illustrate the alleged error.Â  See McElveen v. McElveen, 332 \r\n  S.C. 583, 601 n.4, 506 S.E.2d 1, 10 n.4 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  â€œThis court will not \r\n  consider facts that do not appear in the transcript of record.â€Â  Windham \r\n  v. Honeycutt, 290 S.C. 60, 64, 348 S.E.2d 185, 187 (Ct. App. 1986). Â \r\nBecause we find no evidence supporting \r\n  Jonasâ€™s claim that her absence from the hearing was justified, the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  denial of her motion to dismiss is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, \r\n  JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-129","title":"Clay v.

Sheffield, of Charleston, for Primary Appellant.\r\nJoseph R. Weston, of Mt. Pleasant, for Secondary Appellant.\r\nDaniel E. Henderson, of Ridgeland, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  ECO Services of South Carolina, \r\n  Inc. (ECO) and Joseph Jenkins, appeal from jury verdicts against them on Starr \r\n  Gadsonâ€™s claims for negligent entrustment.Â  We affirm as to Jenkins and reverse \r\n  as to ECO.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nJenkins worked for ECO, solid waste contractor \r\n  that services Beaufort, Jasper, and Hampton counties.Â  As a â€œhelper,â€ Jenkins \r\n  used ECOâ€™s trucks to go back for missed pickups.Â  On August 6, 1997, Jenkins \r\n  failed to return ECOâ€™s truck at then end of the day to the Hilton Head office.Â  \r\n  Instead, he drove the truck to Hardeeville.Â  Gadson testified that she saw Jenkins \r\n  drive the truck to a friendâ€™s house.Â  Jenkinsâ€™s cousin John Jenkins was riding \r\n  in the front of the truck and Gadsonâ€™s brother and another passenger were riding \r\n  in the back.Â  Gadsonâ€™s brother climbed out of the truck and went home. Gadson \r\n  and several other people climbed into the back of the truck and Jenkins drove \r\n  them to McDonaldâ€™s.Â  After they ate, Jenkins drove them to a store where John \r\n  bought a cigar and one or two wine coolers, which he shared with another passenger.Â  \r\n  Jenkins then drove them to the Purrysburg Landing, where they talked for about \r\n  an hour.Â  \r\nWhen the group started back to Hardeeville, John \r\n  was driving the truck. [1] Â  He suddenly sped up to around \r\n  80 miles per hour and then lost control of the vehicle, resulting in the accident.Â  \r\n  Gadson and the other passengers in the back were thrown from the truck.Â  \r\nGadson, along with others injured in the accident, \r\n  brought suit alleging negligence and negligent entrustment against ECO, Jenkins, \r\n  and John. [2] Â  The case was tried to a jury.Â  \r\n  ECO and Jenkins were represented at trial, but Jenkins did not appear.Â  John \r\n  was not represented and did not appear at trial.Â  The jury returned a general \r\n  verdict against all three defendants.Â  The jury found, in special interrogatories, \r\n  as follows:Â  (1)ECO entrusted its vehicle to Jenkins; (2) ECO was negligent \r\n  in entrusting its vehicle to Jenkins; (3) ECOâ€™s negligence proximately caused \r\n  the plaintiffsâ€™ injuries; (4) John was the driver of the vehicle; (5) Johnâ€™s \r\n  negligence proximately caused the plaintiffsâ€™ injuries; (6) Jenkins was not \r\n  the driver of the vehicle; and (7) Jenkins was negligent in entrusting the vehicle \r\n  to John.Â  It awarded Gadson $50,000 in actual damages.Â  \r\nECO and Jenkins both requested and were granted \r\n  ten days to file post-trial motions.Â  In their motions, ECO and Jenkins asked \r\n  for JNOV and new trial based on alleged juror misconduct. [3] Â  The trial court initially dismissed both motions \r\n  finding they were untimely.Â  On remand from this court, the trial court considered \r\n  both motions on the merits, but denied them.Â  ECO and Jenkins appealed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the denial of a motion \r\n  for a directed verdict or JNOV, this court uses the same standard as the trial \r\n  court by viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most \r\n  favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 299, \r\n  536 S.E.2d 408, 418 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The motion must be denied when the evidence \r\n  is susceptible of more than one inference.Â  Id. at 300, 536 S.E.2d at \r\n  418.Â  Neither this court nor the trial court has authority to decide credibility \r\n  issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony or evidence.Â  Id.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nECO and Jenkins both argue the \r\n  trial court erred in denying their motions for directed verdict and JNOV on \r\n  Gadsonâ€™s claims for negligent entrustment.Â  \r\nâ€œThe theory of negligent \r\n  entrustment provides:Â  â€˜the owner or one in control of the vehicle and responsible \r\n  for its use who is negligent in entrusting it to another can be held liable \r\n  for such negligent entrustment.â€™â€ Am. Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Passmore, \r\n  275 S.C. 618, 622, 274 S.E.2d 416, 418 (1981) (quoting 19 A.L.R.3d 1175, 1192).Â  \r\n\r\nThe Restatement (Second) \r\n  of Torts Â§ 308 (1965) [4] , provides \r\n  as follows:\r\n\r\nIt is negligence to permit a third \r\n  person to use a thing or to engage in an activity which is under the control \r\n  of the actor, if the actor knows or should know that such person intends or \r\n  is likely to use the thing or to conduct himself in the activity in such a manner \r\n  as to create an unreasonable risk of harm to others.\r\n\r\nWe will consider Gadsonâ€™s claims \r\n  against ECO first.Â  \r\nIt is undisputed that ECO owned \r\n  the truck involved in the accident.Â  ECO does dispute that Jenkins had authority \r\n  to be driving the truck on the night of the accident.Â  Lou Joseph Diaz, general \r\n  manager for ECO, testified that Jenkins had never taken the truck to Hardeeville \r\n  after work hours prior to the date of the accident.Â  However, one of the other \r\n  passengers injured in the truck contradicted this testimony when he said that \r\n  he had seen Ricky driving the truck around Hardeeville in the evenings for a \r\n  week before the accident.Â  \r\nJenkins was suspended twice early \r\n  in 1997 for unexcused absences from work.Â  Additionally, a note in Jenkinsâ€™s \r\n  personnel file indicated that Jenkins was terminated for unauthorized use of \r\n  a company vehicle on July 11, 1997â€”three weeks before the accident occurred.Â  \r\n  When confronted, Diaz testified that the date on the note was probably a typographical \r\n  error by the personnel office in Charleston.Â  He further testified that the \r\n  note was probably intended to reflect that Jenkins was fired on August 7, 1997 \r\n  as a result of the accident, and that Jenkins had not been disciplined in July \r\n  of 1997.Â  Diaz noted that this could be confirmed by the personnel office; however, \r\n  the ECO employee who inserted the note into the file was never called to testify.Â  \r\n  Hector Calderon, human resource director at ECO, testified that ECO never fired \r\n  Jenkins in July of 1997.Â  He stated ECOâ€™s payroll records showed Jenkins was \r\n  working for the company during that time.Â  We agree with ECO that the only reasonable \r\n  conclusion is that the notation that Jenkins was terminated on July 11, 1997 \r\n  is a typographical error.Â  See Hopson v. Clary, 321 S.C. 312, \r\n  314, 468 S.E.2d 305, 307 (Ct. App. 1996) (stating that although we are bound \r\n  to review the record in a light most favorable to respondents, we â€œcannot ignore \r\n  facts unfavorable to that party.â€)Â  However, even if we accept the notation \r\n  as evidence ECO had previously terminated Jenkins for unauthorized use of a \r\n  vehicle, we find the record does not support the juryâ€™s finding of negligent \r\n  entrustment against ECO.\r\nGadson asserts that the evidence \r\n  proves ECO knew that Jenkins was an irresponsible employee, and therefore was \r\n  likely to cause harm to third parties with the truck.Â  We disagree.Â  The crux \r\n  of the issue is whether ECO knew or should have known that Jenkins intended \r\n  or was likely to use the truck in such a manner as to create an unreasonable \r\n  risk of harm to others.Â  The only inference from the evidence in the record \r\n  is that Jenkins had attendance problems at work about six months before the \r\n  accident, and that he was known to take ECOâ€™s trucks home without authorization.Â  \r\n  Jenkinsâ€™s driving record contained no violations, accidents, or suspensions \r\n  over the three-year period prior to the accident.Â  There is simply no evidence \r\n  that ECO knew that Jenkins was likely to drive the truck recklessly, or that \r\n  ECO knew that Jenkins was likely to entrust the truck to someone else who would \r\n  drive it recklessly.\r\nGadson attempts to close this \r\n  gap by using negative inferences from the fact that Jenkins did not testify \r\n  at the trial.Â  See Duckworth v. First Natâ€™l Bank, 254 S.C. 563, \r\n  576, 176 S.E.2d 297, 304 (1970) (â€œIf a party knows of an available witness on \r\n  a material issue and such witness is within his control and if without satisfactory \r\n  explanation he fails to call him, the jury may draw the inference that the testimony \r\n  of the witness would not have been favorable to such party.â€)Â  However, this \r\n  rule is not applicable here because Jenkins was no longer an employee of ECO \r\n  at the time of trial and thus was no longer under ECOâ€™s control.Â  Id. \r\n  at 576-77, 176 S.E.2d at 304.Â  \r\nThe test for legal sufficiency \r\n  of the evidence in South Carolina is â€œwhether the evidence serves to prove a \r\n  fact or permits an inference of fact that would enable an ordinarily intelligent \r\n  mind to draw a rational conclusion therefrom in support of the right of the \r\n  plaintiff to recover.â€Â  Mahaffey v. Ahl, 264 S.C. 241, 248, 214 S.E.2d \r\n  119, 122 (1975).Â  We find insufficient evidence to support the knowledge prong \r\n  of Gadsonâ€™s negligent entrustment claim against ECO.Â  The evidence presented \r\n  is simply not enough to permit an ordinarily intelligent mind to rationally \r\n  infer that ECO knew that Jenkins was likely to entrust the vehicle to another \r\n  who would drive recklessly.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court erred in denying \r\n  ECOâ€™s motions for directed verdict and JNOV.Â  \r\nJenkinsâ€™ liability for negligently \r\n  entrusting the truck to John is a separate issue.Â  Jenkins did not dispute that \r\n  he had control of the vehicle, or that he entrusted the vehicle to John.Â  Additionally, \r\n  Jenkins has not disputed that this entrustment was unauthorized.Â  We find the \r\n  record supports the inference that Jenkins knew or should have known that Johnâ€™s \r\n  use of the vehicle was likely to cause harm.Â  Jenkins knew that John had been \r\n  drinking alcoholic beverages.Â  Jenkins was apparently familiar with Johnâ€™s character, \r\n  because he was Johnâ€™s cousin.Â  Moreover, because Jenkins did not testify on \r\n  his own behalf, the jury was permitted to infer that any testimony would have \r\n  been unfavorable.Â  See McCowan v. Southerland, 253 S.C. 9, 12, 168 S.E. \r\n  573, 574 (1969) (stating that as to facts that were peculiarly within defendantâ€™s \r\n  knowledge, the defendantâ€™s unexplained failure to testify raises an inference \r\n  that his testimony, if it had been submitted, would have been unfavorable to \r\n  his position).Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court did not err in denying \r\n  Jenkinsâ€™s motions for directed verdict and JNOV.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the order of the \r\n  trial court is\r\n AFFIRMED in part, and REVERSED in part. \r\n HUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The official accident investigation report listed Jenkins as the \r\n    driver of the truck, but the jury by special interrogatory found the driver \r\n    at the time of the accident to be John.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The other cases have been settled and are no longer a part of this \r\n    appeal.Â  In addition, John did not appeal the judgment against him.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  After the trial, Jenkinsâ€™ attorney spoke to one of the jurors and \r\n    discovered that several of the jurors either knew of Jenkins and John or knew \r\n    of their reputations.Â  Additionally, one of the jurors had a cousin who worked \r\n    for ECO.Â  The attorney prepared an affidavit testifying to what he heard.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  In Lydia v. Horton, 343 S.C. 376, 540 S.E.2d 102 (Ct. App. \r\n    2000), this court adopted the Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§Â§ 308 and 390 \r\n    as the standard for negligent entrustment in South Carolina.Â  Lydia \r\n    involved a first party cause of action for negligent entrustment.Â  The South \r\n    Carolina Supreme Court reversed this courtâ€™s opinion, holding that the plaintiff \r\n    could not recover on a first party negligent entrustment cause of action because \r\n    â€œ(1) South Carolinaâ€™s modified comparative negligence scheme would bar recovery \r\n    for this type of claim, and (2) the public policy considerations addressed \r\n    . . . in Tobias v. Sports Club, Inc., 332 S.C. 90, 504 S.E.2d 318 (1998).â€Â  \r\n    Lydia v. Horton, 355 S.C. 36, 39, 583 S.E.2d 750, 752 (2003).Â  The \r\n    supreme court also â€œdecline[d] to adopt sections 308 and 390 of the Restatementâ€ \r\n    based on the facts of that case.Â  Id. at 43, 583 S.E.2d at 754.Â  We \r\n    do not find the supreme courtâ€™s ruling in Lydia would prevent application \r\n    of section 308 of the Restatement under the facts of the present case as the \r\n    question addressed in Lydia was whether South Carolina recognizes a \r\n    first party negligent entrustment claim.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-131","title":"Drucker v.

Phillips, of Columbia, for Appellants.Â  \r\nPaul Collins, of Columbia, for Respondents.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Herbert and Marilyn Drucker \r\n  appeal the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of their negligence claims against the original \r\n  owners who built their house.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn 1989, Ralph and Deborah Witt built \r\n  a house on property they owned in Richland County, South Carolina.Â  The Witts \r\n  hired Gordon Plastering Company to clad the new house with Exterior Insulation \r\n  Finishing System (EIFS), a synthetic stucco material manufactured by Parex.Â  \r\n  On November&nbsp;20, 1997, the Witts sold their house to the Druckers.Â  Five \r\n  years later, the Druckers had the house inspected in preparation for putting \r\n  it up for sale. Â The inspection revealed several problems with the application \r\n  of the EIFS cladding, resulting in damage to the house.Â  \r\nThe Druckers filed a complaint against \r\n  the Witts, Gordon Plastering, Continental Stucco Products, and Parex, alleging \r\n  five causes of action against the Witts, including negligence, breach of express \r\n  warranties, breach of the implied warranties of habitability and workmanlike \r\n  service, and unfair trade practices.Â  All causes of action were predicated on \r\n  the alleged defective application of the EIFS cladding to the house. \r\n  [2] \r\nThe Witts filed a 12(b)(6) motion as to all causes \r\n  of action, arguing the Druckers failed to allege sufficient facts to constitute \r\n  a cause of action.Â  In a brief form order, the trial court dismissed the Druckersâ€™ \r\n  claims for negligence, breach of express warranties, and unfair trade practices, \r\n  stating â€œmotion to dismiss as to causes of action one, two, and eight is granted.â€ \r\n  [3] Â  The Druckers did not file a Rule (59)(e) motion requesting the trial \r\n  court provide specific grounds for its rulings.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Druckers contend the trial court erred by dismissing \r\n  their negligence claims against the Witts, arguing the court improperly relied \r\n  on a factual predicate outside of the pleadings to reach its decision and committed \r\n  an error of law by determining an original builder and owner of a house, who \r\n  is not a house builder by trade, owes no duty to protect a subsequent purchaser \r\n  from negligent construction.Â  We disagree.\r\nFirst, the Druckers allege the trial court improperly \r\n  based its dismissal of their negligence claims on the assumption the Witts were \r\n  not in the business of building houses.Â  Even though the complaint alleged, \r\n  â€œthe Witts built the Property [and] were responsible for hiring the subcontractor \r\n  who clad the Property with EIFS,â€ there is no allegation in the complaint the \r\n  Witts were in the business of building houses.Â  The Druckers contend the improper \r\n  basis for the courtâ€™s ruling was revealed at the motion hearing when the trial \r\n  judge stated, â€œ[the Witts] built it, you know, they lived in it, they sold it, \r\n  then this stucco problem occurred.Â  I mean, you got the wrong person to do that, \r\n  unless they build houses all the time.Â  If they built it, moved into it, the \r\n  homeowner, Iâ€™m sorry.â€Â  \r\nThis issue is not preserved for our review.Â  \r\n  The courtâ€™s statement at the motion hearing is not conclusive proof the court \r\n  utilized an improper basis for its final ruling.Â  The court provided no specific \r\n  grounds for its ruling, and we are unable to determine what particular facts \r\n  the court relied upon in dismissing the Druckersâ€™ negligence claims. The Druckers \r\n  could have requested the court provide more specific or complete grounds for \r\n  its ruling in a 59(e) motion.Â  Because they did not, the trial court was deprived \r\n  of the opportunity to explain its analysis of this issue, and we may not now \r\n  consider it on appeal.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, \r\n  76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (It is axiomatic that an issue must be raised \r\n  to and ruled upon by the trial court before the issue is preserved for appellate \r\n  review.).Â  \r\nNext, the Druckers assert the trial court erred \r\n  as a matter of law by dismissing their negligence claims against the Witts, \r\n  arguing South Carolina recognizes a duty in an individual who builds a house, \r\n  lives there, and later sells it to protect a subsequent buyer from negligent \r\n  construction and may be liable to the buyer in tort for selling a defective \r\n  home.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe cases relied upon by the Druckers recognize a duty from \r\n  a commercial builder of a new house to a buyer, or from a seller to a buyer \r\n  on implied warranties of fitness and habitability but not on negligence claims.Â  \r\n  See Lane v. Trenholm Bldg. Co., 267 S.C. 497, 500, 229 S.E.2d \r\n  728, 729 (1976) (holding a real estate developer has a duty to a buyer of a \r\n  house because â€œwhen a new building is sold there is an implied warranty of fitness \r\n  for its intended use which springs from the sale itself.â€); see also \r\n  Arvai v.

Moss, of Beaufort, for \r\n  Appellant.\r\nStephen L. Brown, John Hamilton \r\n  Smith, and Matthew K. Mahoney, all of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this medical malpractice \r\n  action, we must decide whether the trial court erred in seating two jurors, \r\n  one of whom identified herself as a current patient of the Respondent physician \r\n  and the other who identified himself as a former patient of another physician \r\n  in the Respondentâ€™s medical practice.Â  Over Appellantâ€™s objection, the trial \r\n  judge impaneled these jurors.Â  We find no abuse of discretion and affirm the \r\n  trial judgeâ€™s ruling.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nAppellant James Bruce Saxon, Jr., brought \r\n  this medical malpractice action against Respondent Curtis Stokes, M.D.Â  At the \r\n  time this case was brought to trial, Dr. Stokes was one of six doctors practicing \r\n  general medicine at Walterboro Family Practice, P.A., in Colleton County.Â  Walterboro \r\n  Family Practice, however, was not a party to this action.Â  \r\nDuring jury venire, the trial judge asked \r\n  the pool of potential jurors whether they had any connection with Dr. Stokes \r\n  or the other physicians or employees of Walterboro Family Practice.Â  Twenty-nine \r\n  jurors responded affirmatively.Â  When individually questioned by the trial judge, \r\n  some jurors indicated they were current or longstanding patients of Dr. Stokes \r\n  or the other physicians in his practice, while others responded they were treated \r\n  only once or twice by these doctorsâ€”in some cases, years ago.Â  \r\nSaxon requested that all jurors who were \r\n  being treated by Dr. Stokes and his associates be stricken for cause, arguing \r\n  this doctor-patient relationship would unavoidably hinder these jurorsâ€™ ability \r\n  to view the case impartially. The trial judge disagreed, finding all but one \r\n  of the twenty-nine affected jurorsâ€”based on their responsesâ€”could serve fairly \r\n  and impartially. \r\nAs the jury was being drawn, Saxon used \r\n  all four of his peremptory strikes to excuse jurors who had identified themselves \r\n  as having a connection to Dr. Stokes or his medical practice associates.Â  However, \r\n  two of the affected jurors were drawn after all of the peremptory strikes had \r\n  been exhausted.Â  These two jurorsâ€”juror number 125 and juror number 158â€”were \r\n  both impaneled on the jury despite Saxonâ€™s general objection that any juror \r\n  who had been treated by Dr. Stokes or his associates be struck from the jury. \r\n\r\nDuring the initial jury venire, both juror 125 \r\n  and juror 158 were individually questioned by the trial judge.Â  Juror 125 identified \r\n  herself as a current patient of Dr. Stokes:\r\n\r\nJUROR: My name is Robertson, \r\n  125.\r\nTHE COURT: Thank you.Â  Ms. Robertson, \r\n  whom is it that you recognize?\r\nJUROR: Dr. Stokes and also Dr. \r\n  Hyatt.\r\nTHE COURT: And are they your \r\n  family physicians?\r\nJUROR: Yes, sir.\r\nTHE COURT: And are you -- have \r\n  you seen them in the last six months?\r\nJUROR: Yes, sir.\r\nTHE COURT: And as a result of \r\n  that type of relationship you have with those doctors, can you be fair and impartial \r\n  to both the Plaintiff and Defendant in connection with this case?\r\nJUROR: Yes, I can.\r\n\r\nJuror 158 identified himself as a former patient \r\n  of another physician practicing with Dr. Stokes:\r\n\r\nTHE COURT: Yes, sir?\r\nJUROR: James Walker, Number 158.\r\nTHE COURT: Yes, sir, Mr. Walker. \r\n  Whom do you recognize?\r\nJUROR: Dr. Johnson used to be \r\n  my doctor many years ago.\r\nTHE COURT: And as a result of \r\n  that type of relationship, can you be fair and impartial to the Plaintiff and \r\n  to the Defendant?\r\nJUROR: Yes.Â \r\n\r\nBoth of these jurors were impaneled on \r\n  the twelve-member jury that decided the caseâ€”finding in favor of Dr. Stokes.Â  \r\n  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe decision to disqualify a potential juror for \r\n  bias is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge and that decision \r\n  will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion. Abofreka v. Alston \r\n  Tobacco Co., 288 S.C. 122, 125, 341 S.E.2d 622, 624 (1986); Palmetto \r\n  Bank v. Rowland, 275 S.C. 38, 40, 267 S.E.2d 426, 426 (1980). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Saxon claims the trial judge abused his \r\n  discretion in failing to disqualify juror 125 and juror 158 from serving on \r\n  the jury.Â  Saxon makes two legal arguments here: first, that this court should \r\n  adopt a per se rule that all ongoing patients of a physician involved \r\n  in a medical malpractice action be disqualified from serving on the jury, and, \r\n  alternatively, absent a per se rule, juror 125 and juror 158 should \r\n  nevertheless have been disqualified in this case.Â  Dr. Stokes, however, claims \r\n  that Saxon failed to preserve these issues for appeal.\r\nI.Â  Preservation of Issues for Appeal\r\nWe first address the questions raised \r\n  concerning issue preservation.Â  \r\nRespondent argues that Saxon failed to specifically \r\n  raise an objection to the qualification of jurors 125 and 158, thereby waiving \r\n  any right to appeal the trial judgeâ€™s decision to allow these jurors to serve. \r\n  [1] Â  We agree in part.\r\nAfter carefully reviewing the transcript \r\n  of the jury selection process contained in the record before us, it is clear \r\n  that Saxonâ€™s objection regarding juror disqualification focused primarily on \r\n  those jurors who had identified themselves as current patients of Dr. Stokes.Â  \r\n  Saxon voiced much less concern about those jurors who had been treated many \r\n  years ago or were treated by the other physicians of Walterboro Family Practice.&nbsp;\r\nArguably, therefore, Saxon abandoned his request \r\n  to disqualify all but the current, ongoing patients of Dr. Stokes.Â  However, \r\n  despite this almost exclusive focus on the current patients of Dr. Stokes in \r\n  argument to the trial judge, Saxonâ€™s counsel did, by way of caveat, add: â€œI \r\n  mean, we think that all former or current patients of the \r\n  firm should be stricken, but . . . â€ (emphasis added).Â  While a close \r\n  question is presented, we find this statement preserves Saxonâ€™s general objection \r\n  to any of the twenty-nine affected jurors being allowed to serve on the juryâ€”whether \r\n  they were current or former patients of the defendant or any other physician \r\n  in his practice.\r\nPart of Saxonâ€™s argument to this court, \r\n  however, is that the trial judge was unable to reach a fully informed decision \r\n  about the ability of jurors 125 and 158 to serve impartially because he failed \r\n  to â€œreexamineâ€ those two jurors individually as he had done with other jurors \r\n  specifically identified by Saxon.Â  We find this particular argument is \r\n  not preserved.Â  \r\nThe judge requested from Saxon a list \r\n  of the jurors in question.Â  Saxon furnished the list, and the judge agreed to \r\n  reexamine those jurors on the list.Â  Jurors 125 and 158 were not included on \r\n  the list, and they were not reexamined.Â  Following the judgeâ€™s reexamination \r\n  of those jurors identified on Saxonâ€™s list, and just prior to jury selection, \r\n  the judge asked, â€œAnything else we need to do, as far as the plaintiff is concerned \r\n  prior toâ€ the preparation of the strike sheet?Â Â Â  Saxon, through counsel, responded, \r\n  â€œNo, sir, your honor.â€Â  We find Saxonâ€™s current challenge to the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  failure to reexamine jurors 125 and 158 is not preserved.Â  \r\nII.Â  Qualification of Jurors 125 \r\n  and 158\r\nTurning to the merits of Saxonâ€™s broader \r\n  appeal, and in the application of current law, we find no abuse of discretion \r\n  by the trial judgeâ€™s qualification of jurors 125 and 158.\r\nThe circumstances of this case mirror \r\n  those in the case ofÂ  Roof v. Kimbrough, 297 S.C. 156, 375 S.E.2d 318 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1988).Â  In Roof, the appellants claimed the trial judge erred \r\n  in â€œfailing to strike for cause . . . any prospective juror who was being or \r\n  had been treated, or whose family members were treatedâ€ by the respondent physicians \r\n  in a medical malpractice action.Â  During voir dire, several members of the venire \r\n  responded that they themselves or a close relative had been treated by the respondents.Â  \r\n  The trial judge, however, individually questioned these jurors, and each responded \r\n  that his or her connection to the physicians being sued in that case would not \r\n  prejudice or prevent him or her from reaching a true and just verdict in the \r\n  case.Â  On appeal, this court found no abuse of discretion by the trial court \r\n  in impaneling those jurors. Id. at 158, 375 S.E.2d at 320.\r\nWe find the case at hand is squarely on point with \r\n  Roof.Â  As noted above, the trial judge included both jurors 125 and 158 \r\n  individually in his initial questioning regarding the nature of their relationship \r\n  with Dr. Stokes and Walterboro Family Practice.Â  Both jurors responded unequivocally \r\n  that their respective connections to Dr. Stokes or his associates would not \r\n  prevent them from being fair and impartial.Â  Saxon cites no evidence indicating \r\n  these jurors were harboring any prejudice or otherwise being less than honest \r\n  in answering the trial courtâ€™s questions.Â  \r\nAdditionally, we must reject at this level \r\n  Saxonâ€™s suggestion that such prejudice should be presumed and that we adopt \r\n  a per se rule barring any patient of a defendant in a medical \r\n  malpractice case from serving on the jury. \r\n  [2] Â Â  Our supreme court has signaled no intention to divest the trial courts \r\n  of the discretion to address the qualification of a juror in a medical malpractice \r\n  case as the circumstances of the individual case and the ends of justice require.Â  \r\n  We, as a mere error correction court, decline Saxonâ€™s invitation to deviate \r\n  from precedent and adopt the suggested per se rule in medical \r\n  malpractice actions.Â  While we recognize the special relationship that exists \r\n  between patient and physician, policy matters such as this lie exclusively within \r\n  the supreme court.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nUnder existing law, we find no abuse of \r\n  discretion by the trial judge in denying Saxonâ€™s request to disqualify jurors \r\n  125 and 158 from jury service in this case.Â  \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, \r\n  JJ., concur.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â &nbsp;\r\n\r\n \r\n  Â Â Â Â  \r\n    [1] See United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of \r\n    Health and Envtâ€™l Control, 356 S.C. 266, 273, 588 S.E.2d 599, 602 (2003) \r\n    (holding that an issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial \r\n    court to be preserved for appellate review).Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n  Â Â Â Â  \r\n    [2] Saxon argues the circumstances of the present case are analogous to those \r\n    of Alston v. Black River Electric Cooperative, 345 S.C. 323, 548 S.E.2d \r\n    858 (2001), in which our supreme court adopted a rule that cooperative members \r\n    should per se be disqualified to serve on a jury where the cooperative \r\n    was a party.Â  The ruling in Alston was rooted in the courtâ€™s recognition \r\n    that cooperative members have an â€œinherent pecuniary interest in the caseâ€ \r\n    which would unavoidably hinder their ability to view the case impartially. \r\n    Id. at 331, 548 S.E.2d at 862.Â  Whether an Alston-type exception \r\n    should be recognized in a medical malpractice actionâ€”excusing for cause those \r\n    potential jurors who are current or former patients of the defendant physicianâ€”is \r\n    beyond the purview of this error correction court.Â  Â Â Â \r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-133","title":"State v.

McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, \r\n  and Assistant Attorney General Deborah R. J. Shupe, all of Columbia; and Solicitor \r\n  Randolph Murdaugh, III, of Hampton, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is an appeal from a felony driving \r\n  under the influence conviction.Â  The primary issue is whether a hospital employee \r\n  who obtained a urine sample from the defendant was properly trained and qualified \r\n  under the provisions of our stateâ€™s implied consent law governing the collection \r\n  of blood and urine samples from DUI suspects.Â  We affirm the trial courtâ€™s determination \r\n  that the hospital employee was adequately qualified.Â  \r\nAppellant also claims the trial court improperly \r\n  admitted hearsay testimony.Â  We do not reach the merits of this issue, finding \r\n  it was not preserved for our review.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY\r\nWhile driving down Highway 21 \r\n  in Beaufort County, Aundray Livingston crossed the median and collided head-on \r\n  with an oncoming car, killing its driver.Â  Livingston was injured, but he survived \r\n  the crash and was taken to Beaufort Memorial Hospital for treatment.Â  The Highway \r\n  Patrol officer investigating the accident requested a sample of Livingstonâ€™s \r\n  urine. [1] Â  Harry Jenkins, an \r\n  employee of the hospital, collected the sample from Livingston.Â  Laboratory \r\n  analysis by SLED revealed the urine sample contained significant levels of THC, \r\n  the pharmacologically active component of marijuana.Â  Livingston was later charged \r\n  with felony DUI. \r\nAt trial, Livingston moved to \r\n  exclude evidence of the urine test results, claiming the State failed to establish \r\n  that Jenkins had the proper medical training prescribed under the implied consent \r\n  statute (S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950) to obtain urine samples. The trial court \r\n  denied this motion and admitted the test results.Â  Livingston was subsequently \r\n  convicted of felony DUI and sentenced to twenty-five years imprisonment.Â  \r\nOn appeal, this court found the \r\n  record did not provide a sufficient factual basis to determine whether Jenkins \r\n  was qualified to obtain the sample.Â  We remanded the case to the circuit court \r\n  for a determination of whether Jenkins had the training required under the statute. \r\n\r\nOn remand, the State presented \r\n  testimony from Geraldine Charlesworth, the former Director of Education at Beaufort \r\n  Memorial Hospital.Â  Charlesworth testified she was responsible for clinical \r\n  education of the hospitalâ€™s nursing and clinical staff.Â  She described the â€œcompetency \r\n  and credentialingâ€ process that each hospital employee must pass through after \r\n  they are first hired and the system of evaluations all employees must undergo \r\n  regularly thereafter.Â  With regard to Harry Jenkinsâ€™ qualifications, she testified \r\n  that she had specifically and individually trained Jenkins, and that he was \r\n  skilled in a number of competency areas, including specimen collection. [2]  Charlesworth specifically noted that Jenkinsâ€™ training included \r\n  instruction on the proper procedures for obtaining urine samples.Â  Based on \r\n  this testimony, the trial court found as fact that Jenkins did have the requisite \r\n  medical training to take Livingstonâ€™s urine sample.Â  The present appeal followed. \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW\r\nA trial judgeâ€™s decision to admit or exclude evidence \r\n  is within his discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse \r\n  of discretion. Elledge v. Richland/Lexington Sch. Dist. Five, 352 S.C. \r\n  179, 185, 573 S.E.2d 789, 792 (2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Jenkinsâ€™ Qualification \r\n  to Obtain the Urine Sample\r\nLivingston first argues the trial \r\n  court erred in finding Harry Jenkins was qualified to obtain a urine sample \r\n  under the provisions of the implied consent statute.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder the implied consent statute, \r\n  an arresting officer may direct that a urine sample be collected from a person \r\n  arrested for DUI if that person is unable to submit to a breathalyzer test for \r\n  medical reasons.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950 (Supp. 2004).Â  The statute requires, \r\n  however, that these samples be collected by qualified medical personnel: â€œBlood \r\n  and urine samples must be obtained by physicians licensed by the State Board \r\n  of Medical Examiners, registered nurses licensed by the State Board of Nursing, \r\n  and other medical personnel trained to obtain the samples in a licensed medical \r\n  facility.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950(a).Â  This requirement that blood and urine \r\n  samples be obtained by qualified medical personnel serves the clear purpose \r\n  of ensuring that a specimen collected is free from contamination that would \r\n  diminish the accuracy or reliability of any test results obtained from the sample.\r\nWe find sufficient evidence supports \r\n  the trial court determination that Jenkins was adequately trained to obtain \r\n  a urine sample under section 56-5-2950.Â  As noted above, Geraldine Charlesworth \r\n  presented detailed testimony regarding the competency and credentialing requirements \r\n  all hospital employees must satisfyâ€”skills that not only must be demonstrated \r\n  at the outset of their employment, but must be reassessed on a regular basis \r\n  by the hospitalâ€™s senior staff.Â  Moreover, Charlesworth testified specifically \r\n  that Jenkinsâ€™ had demonstrated competency with regard to the proper procedures \r\n  for collecting urine samples. [3] Â  Contrary to Livingstonâ€™s argument on appeal, there is no requirement \r\n  that Jenkins be a licensed medical professional, as the statute specifically \r\n  includes within its ambit â€œother medical personnel trained to obtain the samples \r\n  in a licensed medical facility.â€\r\nII.Â  Hearsay Objection\r\nLivingston also argues \r\n  the trial court erred in admitting Charlesworthâ€™s testimony regarding Jenkinsâ€™ \r\n  employment records because it was hearsay.Â  We find this issue is not preserved.\r\nGeraldine Charlesworth \r\n  testified during the initial hearing on remand in June 2002.Â  Her testimony \r\n  regarding Jenkinsâ€™ training and qualifications was based in part on her review \r\n  of Jenkinsâ€™ employment files.Â  When the hearing was reconvened in September \r\n  2002, Livingston objected to Charlesworthâ€™s testimony regardingâ€”and reliance \r\n  onâ€”the employment records of Jenkins.Â  The trial court overruled this objection, \r\n  finding it was far too late raise the matter and that Livingston had therefore \r\n  waived any objection. \r\nWe concur in the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  assessment.Â  A contemporaneous objection is required at trial to preserve an \r\n  issue for appellate review. State v. Johnson, 324 S.C. 38, 41, 476 S.E.2d \r\n  681, 682 (1996). The issue must be raised to and ruled on by the trial judge. \r\n  State v. Williams, 303 S.C. 410, 411, 401 S.E.2d 168, 169 (1991). Failure \r\n  to object when the evidence is offered constitutes a waiver of the right to \r\n  object. State v. Black, 319 S.C. 515, 521-22, 462 S.E.2d 311, 315 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1995).Â  Thus, Livingston is procedurally barred from raising this issue \r\n  on appeal.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find there is sufficient \r\n  evidence to support finding that Harry Jenkins was qualified under section 56-5-2950 \r\n  to obtain a urine sample from Livingston.Â  We do not address Livingstonâ€™s hearsay \r\n  objection as it is not preserved for appellate review.Â  The order of the circuit \r\n  court is therefore\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF, KITTREDGE, \r\n  and BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â  Â \r\n\r\n \r\n  Â Â Â Â  \r\n    [1] See State v.

Lindemann, David L. Morrison, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nJ. Charles Ormond, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Donnie Hildreth brought \r\n  an inverse condemnation action against the County of Kershaw alleging its excavation \r\n  of a trench near his property proximately caused damage to his property and \r\n  residence.Â  A jury trial was held and the jury returned a verdict in the amount \r\n  of $125,000 in favor of Hildreth.Â  The County appeals.Â  We affirm.1\r\nFACTS\r\nIn the fall of 1998, the \r\n  County excavated a trench to install a sewer line across the road from Hildrethâ€™s \r\n  property.Â  Hildreth alleged after the County dug the trench, his property began \r\n  to settle.Â  The settling caused extensive damage to his house.Â  \r\nHildreth brought an inverse condemnation action \r\n  against the County claiming the trench proximately caused damage to his property \r\n  and his residence.Â  The case was tried before a jury.Â  During the trial, Hildreth \r\n  presented the expert testimony of Burton Wells, a civil engineer, who testified \r\n  that within a reasonable degree of engineering certainty and based on the data \r\n  he collected, the digging of the trench caused a change in the water regime, \r\n  which resulted in the settlement of Hildrethâ€™s property.Â  The County made a \r\n  motion to strike this testimony due to lack of evidentiary support for Wellsâ€™ \r\n  opinion.Â  The trial court denied this motion.Â  \r\nAt the close of Hildrethâ€™s case and at the close \r\n  of all of the evidence, the County moved for a directed verdict based on Hildrethâ€™s \r\n  failure to prove the trench proximately caused the alleged damage to his property.Â  \r\n  The trial court denied these motions.Â  The case was presented to the jury, which \r\n  returned a verdict for Hildreth in the amount of $125,000.Â  The County made \r\n  a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, new trial nisi, and new trial \r\n  absolute.Â  The trial court denied these motions.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Motion to Strike\r\nThe County argues the trial court erred \r\n  in denying its motion to strike Wellsâ€™ testimony.Â  The County alleges because \r\n  Wells could not opine as to whether a perched water table existed, his opinion \r\n  was based on conjecture, speculation, and supposition.Â  Therefore, the County \r\n  asserts his opinion lacked a sufficient basis and was improperly admitted by \r\n  the trial court.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe admissibility of evidence is within the discretion \r\n  of the trial court and will not be reversed on appeal absent a showing of abuse \r\n  of discretion.Â  Elledge v. Richland/Lexington Sch. Dist. Five,\r\n352 S.C. 179, 185, 573 S.E.2d 789, 792 (2002).Â  Rule 703, SCRE, provides: \r\n\r\n\r\nThe facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion \r\n  or inference may be those perceived by or made known to the expert at or before \r\n  the hearing.Â  If of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular \r\n  field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject, the facts or data \r\n  need not be admissible in evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n  â€œWhere the expertâ€™s testimony is based upon facts sufficient to form the basis \r\n  for an opinion, the trier of fact determines its probative value.â€Â  Berkeley \r\n  Elec. Coop., Inc. v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 304 S.C. 15, 20, 402 S.E.2d 674, 677 (1991).Â  \r\nWe find the trial court did not abuse its discretion \r\n  in allowing Wellsâ€™ testimony.Â  The County did not object to Wellsâ€™ qualifications \r\n  as an expert on civil engineering.Â  The County only argues Wells did not have \r\n  a sufficient basis to render his opinion as to the cause of the subsidence.Â  \r\n  We find the record does establish a sufficient basis forWellsâ€™ opinion.Â  \r\nWells testified he visited Hildrethâ€™s property several \r\n  times, made soil borings, and considered the type of soil according to the Kershaw \r\n  County Soil Report.Â  He reviewed and considered a report generated by another \r\n  engineer who examined the property.Â  He personally inspected the manhole associated \r\n  with the trench and saw it contained water and was rusted and stained, indicating \r\n  the water flowed from the inside of the manhole to the outside.Â  As a result \r\n  of his observations, Wells asked Hildreth to construct wells on his property \r\n  in order to determine the flow of water after significant rain.Â  Wells also \r\n  instructed Hildreth to report the water level in the wells to him, and based \r\n  on these reports, he determined the trench had a connection to the subsidence.Â  \r\n  Wells also determined the soil around the trench was not compacted as evidenced \r\n  by the fact it had settled by at least a foot.Â  Based on these facts, he determined \r\n  the ground water took the path of least resistance and â€œwas most probably intercepted \r\n  by the drain.â€Â  \r\nIn addition, Wells considered the timing of when \r\n  the County excavated the trench and when the subsidence began, and that no previous \r\n  incidences of subsidence occurred.Â  He noted as time progressed, the subsidence \r\n  did not worsen, indicating the soil compacted naturally, and the movement of \r\n  water stabilized.Â  Wells also ruled out other possible causes for the subsidence, \r\n  including a problem with Hildrethâ€™s pool, his septic drain field, drought or \r\n  other weather conditions, or old tree stumps.Â  Therefore, we find this evidence \r\n  established a proper basis for Wellsâ€™ opinion that to a reasonable degree of \r\n  engineering certainty, the most probable cause of the soil subsidence was the \r\n  digging of the trench, which provided a more efficient outlet for subsurface \r\n  water.Â  Accordingly, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying \r\n  the Countyâ€™s motion to strike Wellsâ€™ testimony.Â  \r\nII.Â  Directed Verdict and JNOV\r\nThe County argues the \r\n  trial court erred in denying its motions for directed verdict and JNOV.Â  The \r\n  County asserts Hildreth failed to present evidence that his damages were proximately \r\n  caused by the excavation of the trench.Â  We disagree. \r\nIn considering a directed verdict or a JNOV motion, \r\n  the appellate court, like the trial court, is required to view the evidence \r\n  and the inferences that can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to \r\n  the nonmoving party.Â  Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, \r\n  427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).Â  The motions must be denied when the evidence \r\n  yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.Â  Id.Â  Neither \r\n  the trial court nor the appellate court has authority to decide credibility \r\n  issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony or evidence.Â  Harvey v. Strickland, \r\n  350 S.C. 303, 308, 566 S.E.2d 529, 532 (2002).\r\nWe find evidence does exist to support the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  ruling.Â  Although Wells could not identify the exact mechanism, he determined \r\n  the trench provided a more efficient outlet for the ground water, and therefore, \r\n  it changed the water regime and caused the subsidence in the property.Â  This \r\n  testimony provides a basis upon which the jury could determine the trench proximately \r\n  caused Hildrethâ€™s property to subside.Â  \r\nIn addition to Wellsâ€™ testimony, Hildreth also provided \r\n  other evidence that the trench caused the damage to his property.Â  Hildreth \r\n  testified he did not notice any problems with his property until after the excavation \r\n  of the trench.Â  Hildrethâ€™s ex-wife, in her testimony, confirmed Hildrethâ€™s observation \r\n  that the problems did not begin until after the excavation of the trench.Â  Hildreth \r\n  also introduced photographs during his testimony depicting his property before \r\n  and after the excavation of the trench and the subsidence of the earth surrounding \r\n  the manhole associated with the trench.Â  Therefore, we find evidence does exist \r\n  to support the juryâ€™s determination and accordingly, the trial court properly \r\n  denied the Countyâ€™s motions for directed verdict and JNOV. \r\nIII.Â  Motion for New Trial Absolute \r\nThe County argues the trial judge erred \r\n  in denying its motion for new trial absolute.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe trial court alone has the power to \r\n  grant a new trial nisi when it finds the amount of the verdict to be \r\n  merely inadequate or excessive.Â  Oâ€™Neal v. Bowles, 314 S.C. 525, 526, \r\n  431 S.E.2d 555, 557 (1993). The denial of a motion for a new trial nisi \r\n  is within the trial courtâ€™s discretion and will not be reversed on appeal absent \r\n  an abuse of discretion.Â  Id.Â  On appeal of the denial of a motion for \r\n  a new trial nisi, this court will reverse only when the verdict is grossly \r\n  inadequate or excessive requiring the granting of a new trial absolute.Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial courtâ€™s decision to deny a motion for \r\n  new trial absolute is within its discretion and will not be reversed absent \r\n  an abuse of discretion.Â  Cock-N-Bull Steak House, Inc. v. Generali Ins. Co., \r\n  321 S.C. 1, 9, 466 S.E.2d 727, 731 (1996).Â  When deciding a motion to grant \r\n  a new trial, the court must look at the testimony and inferences raised in favor \r\n  of the nonmoving party.Â  Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 302-03, 536 \r\n  S.E.2d 408, 420 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œThe trial court must set aside a verdict \r\n  only when it is shockingly disproportionate to the injuries suffered and thus \r\n  indicates that passion, caprice, prejudice, or other considerations not reflected \r\n  by the evidence affected the amount awarded.â€Â  Id. at 302, 536 S.E.2d \r\n  at 420.Â  A juryâ€™s determination of damages is entitled to substantial deference \r\n  by this court.Â  Knoke v. S.C. Depâ€™t. of Parks, Recreation &amp; Tourism, \r\n  324 S.C. 136, 141, 478 S.E.2d 256, 258 (1996).\r\n Viewing the testimony in the light most \r\n  favorable to Hildreth, we find the verdict returned by the jury within the scope \r\n  of the evidence.Â  The measure of damages in an inverse condemnation action is \r\n  the diminution in the market value of the property.2Â  Ravan v. Greenville County, 315 S.C. 447, \r\n  465, 434 S.E.2d 296, 307 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  In response to a question regarding \r\n  the value of his home and property without the damage, Hildreth stated:Â  â€œI \r\n  probably figure maybe $180,000.â€Â  When questioned about its value with the damage, \r\n  he stated:Â  â€œWith the damage and the repair and everything, probably $100,000 \r\n  or less.â€Â  From this testimony, the jury could infer the current value is actually \r\n  less than $100,000 and, therefore, the diminution in value was greater than \r\n  $80,000.Â  Hildreth also testified he previously spent two to three thousand \r\n  dollars on repairs.Â  The jury may have considered this amount in increasing \r\n  the diminution in value amount.Â  Hildreth also presented the testimony of his \r\n  contractor, V.C. Rabon, who estimated the cost to repair the house at $74,000.Â  \r\n  However, the costs to repair were not limited solely to Rabonâ€™s $74,000 estimate.Â  \r\n  Specifically, Rabon noted on cross-examination by the Countyâ€™s attorney that \r\n  he did not include the cost to correct any problems with the footings under \r\n  the house.Â  Furthermore, Hildreth presented evidence that not only was his house \r\n  damaged, but his yard was also damaged by the subsidence, with large indentions \r\n  in the yard and buckles and cracks in his cement walkway and cracks in the patio.Â  \r\n  Thus the repairs by Rabon would not alleviate the diminution in value to the \r\n  property itself.Â  Considering the record as a whole we do not find the juryâ€™s \r\n  verdict of $125,000 â€œshockingly disproportionate to the injuries suffered and \r\n  thus indicat[ing] that passion, caprice, prejudice, or other considerations \r\n  not reflected by the evidence affected the amount awarded.â€Â  Thus, under our \r\n  limited standard of review, we are constrained to hold the trial court did not \r\n  abuse its discretion in denying the Countyâ€™s motion for a new trial absolute.Â  \r\n\r\n AFFIRMED.Â  \r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ. concur.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n  1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n  2 \r\n    This court has also recognized prejudgment interest as recoverable in an inverse \r\n    condemnation action.Â  Vick v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp.,\r\n  347 S.C. 470, 481, 556 S.E.2d 693, 699 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  However, \r\n    as the jury was not charged that it could award such interest as damages, \r\n    we will not consider prejudgment interest in determining whether the trial \r\n    court erred in denying the Countyâ€™s motion for a new trial absolute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-135","title":"Woolridge v.

Mitchell, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nJoel S. Brandon and Melegia Lee Daniels, Jr., both of Greenville, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Brenda Wooldridge appeals the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of Greenwood Mills, Inc. in \r\n  her action for wrongful termination.Â  We affirm.1Â  \r\nFacts\r\nWooldridge worked for Greenwood Mills from 1994 \r\n  until June 5, 2001.Â  While Wooldridge was working in the early morning hours \r\n  of June 4, she ran out of a material called roving.Â  She asked her supervisor \r\n  Linda Rush to obtain some for her.Â  As she was accompanying Rush to obtain the \r\n  roving, Wooldridge became involved in an altercation with Sarah Tate, a fellow \r\n  employee, in the post alley between their jobs.Â  Wooldridge testified in her \r\n  deposition that Tate approached her, shaking her finger in Wooldridgeâ€™s face, \r\n  and accusing Wooldridge of â€œhogging the roving.â€Â  Wooldridge told Tate, â€œ[G]et \r\n  your hand out of my face.â€Â  Tate continued pointing her finger at Wooldridge \r\n  so Wooldridge again instructed her to get her hand out of Wooldridgeâ€™s face.Â  \r\n  Rush then told both employees to go home.Â  Wooldridge gathered her purse, told \r\n  her sister she was leaving, and left the plant.Â  Wooldridge acknowledged that \r\n  she was upset, Tate appeared angry, and they both had been speaking loudly.Â  \r\n  She stated she never heard Rush tell them to stop arguing or to return to their \r\n  jobs.Â  \r\nThe next morning Wooldridge returned to the plant \r\n  and spoke with Frankie Wells, the spinning room supervisor, and Pierce Sullivan, \r\n  the human resources manager.Â  They informed her Rush had told them that during \r\n  the argument she had asked Wooldridge and Tate to return to their positions.Â  \r\n  Sullivan told her he was going to investigate the matter.Â  He asked her to return \r\n  the next day.Â  She met with Wells and Sullivan again on June 5.Â  Wells told \r\n  her then she was being discharged for creating a disturbance in the workplace.Â  \r\n  She met with Warren Moore, the vice president of Human Resources, the following \r\n  day.Â  He affirmed that her employment was terminated for creating a disturbance \r\n  in the workplace.Â  Tate was also discharged for the same reason.Â  \r\nWooldridge applied for unemployment benefits \r\n  and was initially disqualified.Â  She appealed this decision and appeared at \r\n  a hearing before a hearing officer of the Employment Security Commission.Â  Rush, \r\n  Sullivan, and Wells testified at the hearing for Greenwood Mills.Â  The hearing \r\n  officer held Wooldridge was disqualified from receiving benefits for thirteen \r\n  weeks because she was discharged for cause.Â  Wooldridge did not appeal this \r\n  ruling.\r\nWooldridge brought this action against \r\n  Greenwood Mills for wrongful termination.Â  She asserted Greenwood Mills acted \r\n  wrongfully by terminating her for exercising a legal right and terminating her \r\n  without adhering to its own policies and procedures.Â  Greenwood Mills moved \r\n  for summary judgment.Â  After a hearing, which Wooldridgeâ€™s counsel failed to \r\n  attend, the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment.Â  This appeal \r\n  followed.Â  \r\nStandard of Review\r\nâ€œThe purpose of summary \r\n  judgment is to expedite the disposition of cases which do not require the services \r\n  of a fact finder.â€Â  Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, \r\n  438 (2003).Â  Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue \r\n  as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter \r\n  of law.Â  Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).Â  \r\n  The evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light \r\n  most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id.Â  â€œIt is well established \r\n  that summary judgment should be granted â€˜. . . in cases in which plain, palpable \r\n  and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ.â€™â€Â  Anders \r\n  v. S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 307 S.C. 371, 373, 415 S.E.2d 406, 407 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1992) (quoting Main v. Corley, 281 S.C. 525, 526, 316 S.E.2d \r\n  406, 407 (1984)); see Bloom v. Ravoira, 339 S.C. 417, 425, 529 \r\n  S.E.2d 710, 714 (2000) (finding where a verdict is not reasonably possible under \r\n  the facts presented, summary judgment is proper).Â  \r\nDiscussion\r\nWooldridge argues a genuine \r\n  issue of material fact exists as to whether Greenwood Mills wrongfully discharged \r\n  her.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nSouth Carolina recognizes \r\n  the doctrine of employment at will in wrongful termination actions.Â  Prescott \r\n  v. Farmers Tel. Coop., Inc., 335 S.C. 330, 334, 516 S.E.2d 923, 925 (1999).Â  \r\n  Although some exceptions have been recognized, the doctrine of employment at-will \r\n  remains in South Carolina as a longstanding economic incentive that provides \r\n  the marketplace its necessary flexibility.Â  Id. at 335, 516 S.E.2d at \r\n  925.Â  At-will employment may be terminated by either party at any time, for \r\n  any reason or for no reason at all.Â  Id. at 334, 516 S.E.2d at 925.Â  \r\n  The general rule is that termination of an at-will employee normally does not \r\n  give rise to a cause of action for breach of contract.Â  Conner v. City of \r\n  Forest Acres, 348 S.C. 454, 463, 560 S.E.2d 606, 610 (2002).Â  \r\nHowever, an employer and \r\n  employee may choose to contractually alter the general rule of employment at-will.Â  \r\n  Prescott, 335 S.C. at 335, 442 S.E.2d at 925.Â  A contract of employment \r\n  may arise from oral or written words or by conduct.Â  Id. at 335, 442 \r\n  S.E.2d at 926.Â  An employee handbook may create such a contract. Small v. \r\n  Springs Indus., 292 S.C. 481, 485, 357 S.E.2d 452, 455 (1987).Â  The court \r\n  in Small explained, â€œIt is patently unjust to allow an employer to couch \r\n  a handbook, bulletin, or other similar material in mandatory terms and then \r\n  allow him to ignore these very policies as â€˜a gratuitous, nonbinding statement \r\n  of general policyâ€™ whenever it works to his disadvantage.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nWooldridge contends that \r\n  her status as more than an at-will employee is disputed.Â  Greenwood Mills presented \r\n  a copy of Wooldridgeâ€™s application.Â  On this application a disclaimer is written \r\n  in bold print:\r\n\r\nI UNDERSTAND THAT THIS \r\n  APPLICATION AND ANY OTHER COMPANY DOCUMENTS ARE NOT CONTRACTS OF EMPLOYMENT, \r\n  AND ANYONE WHO IS HIRED MAY VOLUNTARILY LEAVE EMPLOYMENT, AND MAY BE TERMINATED \r\n  BY THE EMPLOYER AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON. Â I UNDERSTAND THAT ANY ORAL OR WRITTEN \r\n  STATEMENTS TO THE CONTRARY ARE EXPRESSLY DISAVOWED AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED \r\n  UPON BY ANY PROSPECTIVE OR EXISTING ASSOCIATE.Â  \r\n\r\nWooldridge testified that she understood this provision \r\n  when she signed her application.Â  She acknowledged that after she was hired, \r\n  no one told her anything different from the provision.Â  However, she also testified \r\n  that when she was hired, a secretary told her that employees received one write-up \r\n  and then would be fired if they did not follow the rules.Â  She could not recall \r\n  the secretaryâ€™s name.Â  When asked if anyone else had told her about the write-up, \r\n  she stated, â€œYour supervisor tell you on the job.â€Â  She failed to identify the \r\n  supervisor who gave her this information.Â  The trial court did not address whether \r\n  these statements could be construed as an oral contract of employment.Â  Wooldridge \r\n  failed to request the trial court rule on this issue in a Rule 59, SCRCP motion.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, this issue is not properly before this court.Â  See Summer \r\n  v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 43, 492 S.E.2d 55, 58 (1997) (where trial judge \r\n  did not rule on issue at trial and party did not make a Rule 59, SCRCP, motion \r\n  for a ruling, issue is not preserved for appellate review).Â  Furthermore, Wooldridge \r\n  failed to present any evidence that the unnamed secretary and supervisor had \r\n  authority to alter the stated policy of at-will employment found on the application.Â  \r\n  The disclaimer in Wooldridgeâ€™s application clearly provided that any statements \r\n  contradictory to employment at will were disavowed.Â  When opposing a summary \r\n  judgment motion, the nonmoving party must do more than â€œsimply show that there \r\n  is a metaphysical doubt as to the material facts but must come forward with \r\n  specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.â€ Baughman \r\n  v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 115, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545 (1991).Â  \r\n  We find Wooldridge failed to meet this burden.Â  \r\nWooldridge claims the handbook she received when \r\n  she came to work for Greenwood Mills creates a genuine issue of material fact \r\n  concerning her employment status.Â  However, she failed to produce this handbook.Â  \r\n  In an affidavit, Warren Moore, the Vice President of Human Resources for Greenwood \r\n  Mills stated that when Wooldridge was hired in 1994, the company did not have \r\n  any type of employee handbook in place.Â  He explained the company had withdrawn \r\n  a prior handbook in 1988 and that handbook was no longer used by the company.Â  \r\n\r\nWooldridge furthermore failed to recall any provisions \r\n  of the alleged handbook that would alter her status as an at-will employee.Â  \r\n  The mere existence of a handbook does not automatically create a contract of \r\n  employment.Â  See Horton v. Darby Elec. Co., 360 S.C. 58, 67, 599 \r\n  S.E.2d 456, 460-61 (2004) (stating employerâ€™s manual exemplified the appropriate \r\n  manner in which to give employees a guide regarding their employment without \r\n  altering the at-will employment relationship where the manual contained conspicuous \r\n  disclaimers, which the employee understood and the disciplinary procedure contained \r\n  permissive language and did not provide for mandatory progressive discipline).Â  \r\n  In fact, Wooldridge admitted her understanding of the handbook was that â€œif \r\n  you do anything wrong, you know, youâ€™ll get fired.â€Â  Thus, she admitted her \r\n  own understanding of the handbook was that employees could be discharged without \r\n  any special procedures.Â  Thus, even if we assume Wooldridge was given an employee \r\n  handbook, she has failed to present any evidence to support her assertion that \r\n  this handbook altered her at-will status.Â  See Baughman, 306 S.C. \r\n  at 115, 410 S.E.2d at 545 (stating party opposing summary judgment must present \r\n  specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial).Â  \r\nWooldridge next argues that even if her \r\n  employment was at-will, Greenwood Mills wrongfully discharged her in violation \r\n  of public policy.Â  She relies on Ludwick v. This Minute of Carolina, Inc., \r\n  287 S.C. 219, 337 S.E.2d 213 (1985).Â  In Ludwick, the supreme court adopted \r\n  a public policy exception to the employment at-will doctrine and held: â€œWhere \r\n  the retaliatory discharge of an at-will employee constitutes violation of a \r\n  clear mandate of public policy, a cause of action in tort for wrongful discharge \r\n  arises.â€Â  Id. at 225, 337 S.E.2d at 216.Â  This exception â€œclearly applies \r\n  in cases when an employer requires an employee to violate the law or the reason \r\n  for the employeeâ€™s termination was itself a violation of criminal law.â€Â  Lawson \r\n  v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 340 S.C. 346, 350, 532 S.E.2d 259, 260-61 (2000).Â  \r\n  In addition, an at-will employee may not be terminated for exercising a constitutional \r\n  right.Â  Moshtaghi v. The Citadel, 314 S.C. 316, 322, 443 S.E.2d 915, \r\n  919 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  Wooldridge asserts the legal right Greenwood Mills interfered \r\n  with was â€œher right to tell Tate to get her hand out of her face, and her right \r\n  to work in an environment without getting offended, hurt, or threatened by a \r\n  co-worker.â€Â  Wooldridge acknowledged Tate never physically harmed her or threatened \r\n  her with a violent act.Â  She also admitted her own voice was loud during the \r\n  altercation.Â  Wooldridge failed to present any law to the trial court or this \r\n  court that she had a â€œright to tell Tate to get her hand out of her faceâ€ so \r\n  that Greenwood Millsâ€™ discharge of her based on her participation in the altercation \r\n  with Tate was a violation of public policy.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial \r\n  court did not err in granting Greenwood Mills summary judgment on this issue.Â  \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nWe hold Wooldridge has failed to establish \r\n  a genuine issue of material fact that her employment with Greenwood Mills was \r\n  other than at-will.Â  We furthermore hold she has failed to establish her discharge \r\n  was in violation of public policy.Â  Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s grant of \r\n  summary judgment on her claim for wrongful discharge is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n GOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n  1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-136","title":"Burnside v.

Widener and Celeste T. Jones, both of \r\n  Columbia, for Appellants.\r\nDonald W. Harper, of Rock Hill, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This case arises from a dispute \r\n  over hunting rights reserved by Appellants in a deed to a large tract of land \r\n  they sold.Â  Appellants brought this action for trespass and conversion, claiming \r\n  the present owner of the property infringed upon these hunting rights.Â  The \r\n  circuit court dismissed these claims on grant of summary judgment, finding the \r\n  Appellants had forfeited their hunting rights.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThe property at issue in this case is an 875 acre \r\n  tract of undeveloped land in Fairfield County.Â  Appellant Marion Burnside, Jr., \r\n  and the Burnside family had owned the property for many years and enjoyed using \r\n  it for hunting recreation.Â  In May 1980, Marion Burnside and two other family \r\n  members sold the property to the Catawba Newsprint Company, a timber company \r\n  later known as Bowater. [1] Â  The Burnsides, however, wanted to retain the \r\n  familyâ€™s right to continue hunting and fishing on the land.Â  To this end, the \r\n  deed to Bowater included terms specifically reserving the hunting rights on \r\n  the property to the Burnsides:\r\n\r\nHunting rights on the above described \r\n  property are RESERVED by Marion T. Burnside, Jr. and his two sons, David B. \r\n  Burnside and Marion T. Burnside, III, and Ken Richmond for a period of 10 years \r\n  from the date of this deed; thereafter, Marion T. Burnside, Jr. and his two \r\n  sons reserve the right to lease the hunting rights on a year to year basis.Â  \r\n  The consideration for the lease shall be equal to the amount of the previous \r\n  yearâ€™s property taxes. \r\n\r\nAs provided in the deed, the Burnsides \r\n  held the hunting rights for the first ten years at no cost.Â  After this ten \r\n  year period expired in 1990, Bowater began the practice of annually sending \r\n  notice of the amount of property tax due to the Burnsides in April or May along \r\n  with a year long lease that would generally run from July 1st to June 30th.Â  \r\n  Each year the Burnsides would execute the lease and return it with the rent \r\n  payment. Â Often, this task was handled by John Jernigan, who served as \r\n  the agent of Marion T. Burnside, Jr., for purposes of managing the hunting rights \r\n  and wildlife on the property.Â  Jernigan would execute the yearly leases under \r\n  the name â€œBurnsides Hunt Clubâ€ or â€œJohn Jernigan Hunt Club.â€ \r\nIn December 1997, Respondent Mary Clare \r\n  Matthews purchased the property from Bowater.Â  Matthews was aware of the Burnsidesâ€™ \r\n  hunting rights, and, without success, sought relinquishment of those rights.Â  \r\n  At the time Matthews purchased the property, it remained subject to a hunting \r\n  rights lease between Bowater and the Burnsides (via the â€œJohn Jernigan Hunt \r\n  Clubâ€), which expired in June 1998. \r\nIn May or June of 1998, Jernigan contacted \r\n  Bowater to inquire about the property tax due in order that the hunting rights \r\n  lease could be executed for the next year.Â  Bowater informed Jernigan of the \r\n  sale to Matthews.Â  Appellants claimed Jernigan attempted to contact Matthews \r\n  about entering into a new lease for the 1998-1999 hunting season prior to the \r\n  expiration of the 1997-1998 lease with Bowater.Â  Matthews denied receiving any \r\n  such communication.Â  It is undisputed, however, that in May 1999â€”nearly one \r\n  year after the previous lease expiredâ€”Jernigan mailed Matthews a check for $1,486 \r\n  to cover the taxes due on the property.Â  Matthews refused to accept the payment.Â  \r\n  Matthews eventually changed the locks on the gates that provided access to the \r\n  property, and she also allowed others to hunt on the property. \r\nThe Burnsides later brought this action \r\n  against Matthews alleging trespass and conversion of the Burnsidesâ€™ hunting \r\n  rights.Â  Matthews denied these allegations and counterclaimed for trespass and \r\n  slander of title.Â  The circuit court subsequently granted Matthewsâ€™ motion for \r\n  summary judgment on all claims, finding, inter alia, the Burnsides \r\n  had forfeited their hunting rights by failing to give notice of their intent \r\n  to exercise the lease option.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, \r\n  this court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule \r\n  56(c), SCRCP.Â  Nexsen v. Haddock, 353 S.C. 74, 77, 576 S.E.2d 183, 185 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œSummary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue \r\n  as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a \r\n  matter of law.â€Â  Kirkman v. Parex, Inc., 356 S.C. 525, 527-28, 590 S.E.2d \r\n  36, 37 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing Rule 56, SCRCP, and South Carolina Prop. &amp; \r\n  Cas. Guar. Assâ€™n. v. Yensen, 345 S.C. 512, 518, 548 S.E.2d 880, 883 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001)).Â  In determining whether summary judgment was proper, the court \r\n  views the evidence and the inferences that can be drawn therefrom in a light \r\n  most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, \r\n  452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, the Burnsides assert several \r\n  alternative grounds they claim warrant a reversal of the circuit courtâ€™s grant \r\n  of summary judgment in favor of Matthews.Â  For the reasons detailed below, we \r\n  reject all of these arguments.\r\nI.Â  Exercise of Hunting Rights Under \r\n  the Terms of the Deed\r\nThe Burnsides first argue that, assuming \r\n  they failed to give timely notice to Matthews of their intent to lease the hunting \r\n  rights on the property at the end of their existing lease with Bowater, such \r\n  failure did not forfeit all future hunting rights under the deed.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Burnsides contend the language in \r\n  the deed granting them the right to lease the hunting rights â€œon a year to year \r\n  basisâ€ meant they had the option to lease the hunting rights every year, or \r\n  they could not lease one year but then lease the next yearâ€”in effect allowing \r\n  them to skip any year or years of their choosing, after which they could resume \r\n  the lease arrangement upon notice to the property owner.Â  Therefore, failure \r\n  to give notice for any one particular year would not operate to forfeit the \r\n  right for future years.Â  According to the Burnsides, even if this interpretation \r\n  were found to be incorrect by the fact finder at trial, their argument points \r\n  to an ambiguity in the terms of the lease that, at a minimum, gives rise to \r\n  a question of material fact sufficient to overcome Matthewsâ€™ motion for summary \r\n  judgment.Â  Looking, however, to the plain meaning of the hunting rights lease \r\n  and applying the well settled rules for construing restrictions in deeds, we \r\n  find no such ambiguity and no support for the interpretation of the lease terms \r\n  urged by the Burnsides.\r\nâ€œThe construction of a clear \r\n  and unambiguous deed is a question of law for the court.â€Â  Gardner v. Mozingo, \r\n  293 S.C. 23, 25, 358 S.E.2d 390, 392 (1987); see also Shipyard \r\n  Prop. Ownersâ€™ Assâ€™n v. Mangiaracina, 307 S.C. 299, 308, 414 S.E.2d 795, \r\n  801 (Ct. App. 1992). The court will neither limit a restriction in a deed nor \r\n  will the court enlarge or extend it by construction or implication beyond the \r\n  clear meaning of its terms even to accomplish what it thinks the parties would \r\n  have desired if they had foreseen the development of a particular situation.Â  \r\n  Taylor v. Lindsey, 332 S.C. 1, 4, 498 S.E.2d 862, 864 (1998).Â Â  \r\n\r\nIt is still the settled rule \r\n  in this jurisdiction that restrictions as to the use of real estate should be \r\n  strictly construed and all doubts resolved in favor of free use of the property, \r\n  subject, however, to the provision that this rule of strict construction should \r\n  not be applied so as to defeat the plain and obvious purpose of the instrument. \r\n\r\n\r\nId.Â  Further, â€œâ€˜[a] \r\n  restriction on the use of property must be created in express terms or by plain \r\n  and unmistakable implication, and all such restrictions are to be strictly construed, \r\n  with all doubts resolved in favor of the free use of property.â€™â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 5, 498 S.E.2d at 864 (quoting Hamilton v. CCM, Inc., 274 S.C. 152, \r\n  157, 263 S.E.2d 378, 380 (1980)).Â  In interpreting options or rights to extend \r\n  a lease, our courts have consistently held that such options or rights are to \r\n  be strictly construed against the party claiming the option. See 33 \r\n  Flavors Stores of Virginia, Inc. v. Hoffmanâ€™s Candies, Inc., 296 S.C. 37, \r\n  40, 370 S.E.2d 293, 295 (Ct. App. 1988) (holding that â€œbecause of its unilateral \r\n  nature, an option to renew a lease is strictly construed against the party claiming \r\n  the optionâ€) (citing Southern Silica Mining &amp; Mfg. Co. v. Hoefer, \r\n  215 S.C. 480, 56 S.E.2d 321 (1949)).\r\nWe find no provision \r\n  in the lease termsâ€”explicit or impliedâ€”suggesting the Burnsides could unilaterally \r\n  choose to exercise their option to lease the hunting rights to the property \r\n  any year of their choosing for perpetuity.Â  The terms of the deed granting the \r\n  Burnsides the right to lease the hunting rights on a â€œyear to yearâ€ basis plainly \r\n  mean that the Burnsides could renew or extend their right to hunt on the property \r\n  in consecutive years following the expiration of the initial ten year period \r\n  reserving the hunting rights.Â  To hold otherwise would place a severe encumbrance \r\n  upon the use and alienability of the property for an indefinite period of time.Â  \r\n  Absent explicit language in the terms of the deed indicating the parties intended \r\n  such an expansive encroachment upon the rights of the immediate grantee and \r\n  all future owners of the underlying fee, we decline to adopt such an interpretation.\r\nII.Â  Purported \r\n  Questions of Fact Concerning Timely Notice\r\nThe Burnsides alternatively \r\n  argue that they did in fact provide Matthews with sufficient notice of their \r\n  intent to extend or renew their hunting rights lease prior to the expiration \r\n  of their existing lease with Bowater for the 1997-1998 hunting season.Â  In support \r\n  of this argument, the Burnsides rely upon three pieces of evidence that they \r\n  claim establish their attempts to give timely notice to Matthews: the deposition \r\n  and affidavit of John Jernigan and the check for the property tax payment Jernigan \r\n  mailed to Matthews in May 1999.Â  At a minimum, they claim this evidence created \r\n  a question of material fact not ripe for disposition at the summary judgment \r\n  stage.Â  We address the sufficiency of each of these items separately.Â  \r\nA.Â  Jerniganâ€™s Deposition\r\nThe Burnsides argue Jerniganâ€™s deposition, when \r\n  viewed in a light most favorable to them, creates an issue of fact as to timely \r\n  notice.Â Â  We disagree.Â  Contrary to the Burnsidesâ€™ characterization of Jerniganâ€™s \r\n  deposition testimony, we find no statement in this testimony indicating Jernigan \r\n  contacted Matthews prior to mailing the check for the property tax payment in \r\n  May 1999â€”approximately ten months after the last existing lease had expired.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, even when viewing Jerniganâ€™s deposition in a light most favorable \r\n  to the Burnsides as we must, we cannot discern from this testimony any genuine \r\n  issue of material fact regarding timely notice. \r\nB.Â  Jerniganâ€™s Affidavit\r\nThe Burnsides submitted an affidavit of John Jernigan \r\n  to the circuit court in which Jernigan states that he â€œattempted to call Ms. \r\n  Matthews over a three-to-four month time span, without success.â€Â  The circuit \r\n  court found the submission of the affidavit to be untimely and refused to consider \r\n  it.Â  The Burnsides contend this refusal was an abuse of discretion.\r\nWe find no error in the \r\n  circuit judgeâ€™s rejection of this affidavit. Rule 56(c), SCRCP specifies that \r\n  when filing papers in response to motions for summary judgment, â€œ[t]he adverse \r\n  party may serve opposing affidavits not later than two days before the hearing.â€ \r\n  Our supreme court has ruled that the trial court may, in its discretion, â€œrefuse \r\n  to consider materials that were not timely served such that the opposing party \r\n  had no time to prepare a response.â€ Black v. Lexington Sch. Dist. No. 2, \r\n  327 S.C. 55, 60, 488 S.E.2d 327, 329 (1997) (holding that the trial court did \r\n  not abuse its discretion in refusing to consider an affidavit filed on the date \r\n  of the hearing when the appellantâ€™s lawyer admitted he failed to serve the affidavit \r\n  within the time required by Rule 56 and failed to assert any good excuse for \r\n  that failure).Â  \r\nIn the present case, the \r\n  affidavit was submitted two weeks after the summary judgment hearing.Â  \r\n  Indeed, the affidavit was submitted after the circuit court had notified \r\n  the parties by letter that it intended to grant Matthewsâ€™ summary judgment motion.Â  \r\n  As the circuit court explained in denying the Burnsidesâ€™ motion to alter or \r\n  amend judgment, the Burnsidesâ€™ attorney neither offered to submit nor requested \r\n  leave to submit the affidavit.Â  Moreover, we concur in the circuit courtâ€™s assessment \r\n  that the Burnsides were clearly aware that the matter involved in the affidavit \r\n  was a basis for Matthewsâ€™ summary judgment motion, rendering the delay in producing \r\n  the affidavit without any legitimate explanation or excuse.Â  Accordingly, we \r\n  find no abuse of discretion in the circuit courtâ€™s refusal to consider the affidavit. \r\n\r\nC.Â  May 1999 Check to Matthews\r\nThe Burnsidesâ€™ next argue that the check Jernigan \r\n  sent to Matthews in May 1999 was sufficient to create a genuine issue of material \r\n  fact as to timely notice.Â  This argument, however, rests upon the premise that \r\n  the terms of the deed entitle the Burnsides to exercise their right to lease \r\n  the hunting rights in any year of their choosing, even after the expiration \r\n  of the existing lease.Â  As discussed in Section I, supra, we reject this \r\n  interpretation of the deed language.Â  Accordingly, the claim that a check mailed \r\n  over ten months after the expiration of the existing lease could serve as effective \r\n  notice of the exercise of the hunting rights lease is without merit.Â  Thus, \r\n  the circuit court properly determined the check raised no genuine issue of material \r\n  fact as to whether notice was timely provided.\r\nIII.Â  Course of Dealing\r\nThe Burnsides also argue \r\n  the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment because Matthews owed a \r\n  duty to the Burnsides to notify them of the lease amount based on a course of \r\n  dealing between Bowater and the Burnsides under the deed.Â  \r\nThis argument was not raised to the circuit court.Â  \r\n  No mention is made of it in the complaint, in the Burnsidesâ€™ memorandum in opposition \r\n  to summary judgment, or in their motion to amend or alter the judgment.Â  To \r\n  be preserved for appellate review, an issue must have been raised to and ruled \r\n  upon by the trial court.Â  United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. South Carolina \r\n  Depâ€™t of Health and Envtâ€™l Control, 356 S.C. 266, 273, 588 S.E.2d 599, 602 \r\n  (2003).Â  Because the Burnsides failed to raise this argument prior to appeal, \r\n  this issue is not properly before us.Â  \r\nIV. Additional Issue Raised on Appeal\r\nIn its order granting Matthewsâ€™ motion \r\n  for summary judgment, the circuit court held: \r\n\r\nEven if the Court construes the \r\n  deed to create a year to year lease rather than a right or option to lease, \r\n  the failure of the Plaintiffs to pay or tender rent for a period of ten months \r\n  constitutes a material breach of the lease resulting in a forfeiture even under \r\n  the stringent requirements of Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, \r\n  312 S.C. 271, 440 S.E.2d 364 (1994).Â  \r\n\r\nOn appeal, the Burnsides \r\n  assert this finding of the circuit court was error.Â  However, we find summary \r\n  judgment was properly granted on the grounds that notice was insufficient and \r\n  no lease relationship was created between the Burnsides and Matthews.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we need not reach this alternative ground regarding whether the Burnsidesâ€™ actions \r\n  constituted a material breach in the event such a lease was found to exist. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the circuit court properly determined \r\n  that the Burnsides failed to notify Matthews of their intent to extend, renew, \r\n  or otherwise exercise their option to lease the hunting rights to the property \r\n  and therefore forfeited their right to do so in the future.Â  Concomitantly, \r\n  we find that no genuine issue of material fact precluded this determination \r\n  at the summary judgment stage.Â  Appellantsâ€™ other arguments concerning the legal \r\n  effects of a purported course of dealing between the parties and material breach \r\n  of the lease are either unpreserved or unnecessary to our decision today.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE and BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\n \r\n  Â Â Â Â  \r\n    [1] For clarity and ease of reference we will refer to the company as Bowater \r\n    throughout this opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-137","title":"SC Department of Probation","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayUnPubOpinion.cfm?caseNo=2005-UP-137","description":null,"date":"2005-02-24","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n<!--\r\n.Normal\r\n\t{font-size:12.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoHeading7\r\n\t{text-align:center;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:black;}\r\n.MsoFootnoteText\r\n\t{font-size:10.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoFootnoteReference\r\n\t{vertical-align:super;}\r\n.MsoBodyText\r\n\t{font-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoBlockText\r\n\t{text-align:justify;\r\n\ttext-indent:.5in;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:black;}\r\n.documentbody1\r\n\t{}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS OPINION HAS NO PRECEDENTIAL \r\n  VALUE.Â  IT SHOULD NOT BE CITED OR RELIED ON AS PRECEDENT IN ANY PROCEEDING EXCEPT \r\n  AS PROVIDED BY RULE 239(d)(2), SCACR.\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nSouth Carolina Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services/In \r\n        Re: The State,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellant,\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nv.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nElijah Byrd,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRespondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Fairfield County\r\nKenneth G.

Taggart,\r\nof Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The Department of Probation, \r\n  Parole and Pardon (the Department) appeals the trial courtâ€™s probationary sentence \r\n  ordering Elijah Byrd to pay restitution directly to the victimâ€™s attorney rather \r\n  than to the Department as statutorily required.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nByrd was indicted for felony driving under the \r\n  influence causing great bodily injury.Â  On January 21, 2004, Byrd pled guilty \r\n  as charged pursuant to a plea agreement that Byrd receive a time served sentence \r\n  with a suspended probationary sentence and order for restitution.Â  The trial \r\n  judge sentenced Byrd to fifteen years suspended upon the service of time served \r\n  and five years probation.Â  He ordered as a special condition of probation that \r\n  Byrd pay $10,000 restitution directly to the victimâ€™s attorney in equal monthly \r\n  installments.Â  \r\nOn January 28, 2004, the Department filed a motion \r\n  to reconsider the sentencing order, challenging the trial courtâ€™s authority \r\n  to order restitution payments directly to the victimâ€™s attorney on the basis \r\n  that the Department is statutorily mandated to collect restitution from all \r\n  defendants on probation.Â  The Department requested the trial court grant the \r\n  motion to reconsider and order defendant to pay restitution and the collection \r\n  fee to the Department.Â  The trial court summarily denied the motion.Â  The Department \r\n  appeals. Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Department argues the trial court \r\n  erred in ordering Byrd to pay restitution directly to the victimâ€™s attorney \r\n  rather than to the Department while Byrd was under probationary supervision.Â  \r\n  It contends, pursuant to South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-490 (Supp. 2004) \r\n  [1]  the trial court lacked authority to waive either the Departmentâ€™s duty \r\n  to collect and distribute restitution, or the twenty percent collection fee \r\n  on restitution payments paid through the Department.Â  We agree.\r\nThe case of S.C. Depâ€™t. of Prob., Parole \r\n  and Pardon Servs.:Â  In re State v. Reynolds, 343 S.C. 465, 540 S.E.2d 480 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2000) is directly on point.Â  In Reynolds, the Department argued \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s sentence requiring the defendant to pay restitution directly \r\n  to the victim violated Â§ 24-21-490(A), and the sentence had the effect of waiving \r\n  the twenty percent collection fee the Department is required to assess on restitution \r\n  payments.Â  Id. at 468, 540 S.E.2d at 482.Â  This court agreed, holding \r\n  as follows:\r\n\r\nWe conclude section 24-21-490(A) is unambiguous and conveys \r\n  a clear and definite meaning. The legislature stated its intention that the \r\n  Department collect restitution owed by all offenders under probationary \r\n  and intensive probationary supervision, and then distribute that money to the \r\n  victims.\r\nWe agree with the Department that the circuit court does \r\n  not have the authority to circumvent the legislatureâ€™s intent for the Department \r\n  to manage the payment of restitution from individuals under its supervision.Â  \r\n  Once an individual is placed on probation, any restitution owed by that individual \r\n  must be collected and distributed by the Department.\r\n\r\nId.Â  at 469, 540 S.E.2d at 482-83 (emphasis \r\n  in original). Â We also found â€œthe trial court does not have the authority to \r\n  waive the collection fee on restitution payments paid to the Department.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n  at 469, 540 S.E.2d at 483.Â  Based upon Reynolds, we agree with the Department \r\n  that the trial judge exceeded his authority in ordering Byrd to pay restitution \r\n  directly to the victimâ€™s attorney.\r\nByrd maintains that this court should \r\n  not consider the issue because it is not properly preserved for appellate review.Â  \r\n  We disagree. \r\nByrd argues the State did not contemporaneously \r\n  object to the trial judgeâ€™s sentence, including the provision that restitution \r\n  be paid directly to the victimâ€™s attorney, and the solicitor in fact agreed \r\n  that the restitution be paid in this manner.Â  It is clear, however, the Department \r\n  raised the issue at the first opportunity it had, filing the motion for reconsideration \r\n  before the trial court within seven days of the courtâ€™s sentencing order. \r\n  [2]  Â Because the Department raised the issue when it first learned of the \r\n  improper condition of probation, we find the issue is preserved for our review.Â  \r\n  See First Union Natâ€™l Bank of S.C. v. Soden, 333 S.C. 554, 568, \r\n  511 S.E.2d 372, 379 (Ct. App. 1998) (noting where an appellant learns for the \r\n  first time when the appellant receives the order that the respondent would be \r\n  granted certain relief, the appellant must move to alter or amend the judgment \r\n  to preserve the issue). [3] \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the sentencing order \r\n  is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] This section provides in part as follows:\r\n  (A) The Department of Probation, \r\n    Parole and Pardon Services shall collect and distribute restitution on a monthly \r\n    basis from all offenders under probationary and intensive probationary supervision.\r\n  (B) Notwithstanding Section \r\n    14-17-725, the department shall assess a collection fee of twenty percent \r\n    of each restitution program and deposit this collection fee into a separate \r\n    account.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Byrd argues the motion to reconsider was improperly before the court \r\n    because the Department failed to file a motion to intervene.Â  Byrd raises \r\n    this intervention argument only in conjunction with his assertion that the \r\n    issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  He does not raise a separate \r\n    issue that the Department was required to file certain documents to properly \r\n    intervene, nor does he argue the appeal should be dismissed because the Department \r\n    failed to properly intervene.Â  Further, he cites no applicable law and makes \r\n    only a cursory argument.Â  See Reynolds, 343 S.C. at 468 n.1, \r\n    540 S.E.2d at 482 n.1 (wherein this court declined to consider Reynoldsâ€™ argument \r\n    that the Department did not have the right to appeal the order or sentence \r\n    because the Department failed to file a motion to intervene, where Reynolds \r\n    failed to cite authority and her argument was so conclusory as to amount to \r\n    an abandonment of the issue on appeal.)\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] But see State v. Cox, 328 S.C. 371, 492 S.E.2d \r\n    399 (Ct.

Scarafile, both of Charleston, for Respondent.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  North Charleston Sewer District \r\n  appeals the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of Berkeley County, \r\n  arguing the court erred by refusing to strike certain provisions of the partiesâ€™ \r\n  sewer service agreement and consent order as ultra vires and void as against \r\n  public policy.Â  Because this litigation does not present a justiciable controversy, \r\n  we vacate the trial courtâ€™s order.Â  \r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn 1985, the North Charleston Sewer District (the \r\n  District) entered into a service agreement with the Berkeley County Water and \r\n  Sanitation Authority (the County) to operate the wastewater management system \r\n  for certain subdivisions in Berkeley County.Â  The contract required the District \r\n  and the County to obtain written permission from one another before expanding \r\n  service beyond their primary jurisdictions.Â  In 1994, Berkeley County brought \r\n  a declaratory judgment action to interpret the agreement, alleging the District \r\n  breached it by providing service to a naval base in Berkeley County without \r\n  requesting or obtaining written permission from the County.Â  By a consent order, \r\n  the parties agreed to allow the District to continue serving the base, required \r\n  the District to inform the County in writing when it received a request for \r\n  sewer service in Berkeley County and in the future obtain written permission \r\n  before providing additional service outside its primary jurisdiction.Â  \r\nIn 1998, the District brought a declaratory judgment \r\n  action requesting a modification of the consent order and the original service \r\n  agreement to eliminate any requirement for written permission prior to their \r\n  expanding sewer service within Berkeley County, arguing the supreme courtâ€™s \r\n  decision in City of Beaufort v. Beaufort-Jasper County Water &amp; Sewer \r\n  Auth., 325 S.C. 174, 480 S.E.2d 728 (1997), declared such a provision ultra \r\n  vires and void as against public policy.Â  The parties stipulated the pertinent \r\n  facts and made cross motions for summary judgment.Â  The circuit court granted \r\n  summary judgment in favor of the County, determining the permission requirement \r\n  was valid and enforceable even though it bound the Districtâ€™s future governing \r\n  boards, because it did not substantially compromise the Districtâ€™s primary function \r\n  of providing wastewater management to North Charleston.Â  The court also found \r\n  the provision did not offend the supreme courtâ€™s decision in Beaufort \r\n  because it did not delegate away those powers and responsibilities for which \r\n  District was createdâ€”namely, to provide sewer service to the northern part of \r\n  Charleston County.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe District contends \r\n  the circuit court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of the County, \r\n  arguing provisions in the partiesâ€™ service agreement and the consent order impermissibly \r\n  bind its future governing boards and substantially compromise the Districtâ€™s \r\n  central and primary function, contrary to our supreme courtâ€™s decision in City \r\n  of Beaufort v. Beaufort-Jasper County Water &amp; Sewer Auth., 325 S.C. \r\n  174, 480 S.E.2d 728 (1997).Â  We decline to address the merits of the Districtâ€™s \r\n  argument, find the circuit court erred by doing so, and therefore vacate the \r\n  circuit courtâ€™s order.\r\nâ€œA threshold inquiry \r\n  for any court is a determination of justiciability, i.e., whether the litigation \r\n  presents an active case or controversy.Â  A justiciable controversy is a real \r\n  and substantial controversy which is ripe and appropriate for judicial determination, \r\n  as distinguished from a contingent, hypothetical or abstract dispute.â€Â  Peopleâ€™s \r\n  Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assoc. of South Carolina v. Res. Planning Corp., 358 \r\n  S.C. 460, 477, 596 S.E.2d 51, 60 (2004) (internal citations omitted).Â  To bring \r\n  a valid cause of action under the Declaratory Judgment Act, a party must demonstrate \r\n  a justiciable controversy exists.Â  Southern Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Harrison \r\n  Sales Co., 285 S.C. 50, 51, 328 S.E.2d 66, 67 (1985).Â  \r\nThe District has not \r\n  alleged its intention to expand sewer service further into Berkeley County without \r\n  obtaining the countyâ€™s permission.Â  Nor has the County asserted any claim of \r\n  a breach of the contested provisions of the agreement or consent order.Â  Consequently, \r\n  we are compelled to inquire if any other adverse legal interests exist that \r\n  create a valid case or controversy.Â  See Wallace v. City of York, \r\n  276 S.C. 693, 694, 281 S.E.2d 487, 488 (1981) (holding the function of a court \r\n  is â€œto decide actual controversies injuriously affecting the rights of some \r\n  party to the litigation.â€); Power v. McNair, 255 S.C. 150, 153, 177 S.E.2d \r\n  551, 552 (1970) (holding parties cannot by consent confer jurisdiction on the \r\n  court to render a declaratory judgment).Â  \r\nWe simply cannot discern any \r\n  conflicting contentions between the parties that present a real, presently existing \r\n  controversy for decision.Â  Accordingly, any opinion rendered would be advisory \r\n  only, and would, of necessity, require us to suppose facts and circumstances \r\n  not yet in existence.Â  Such a course is impermissible and we must therefore \r\n  decline to address the issues presented, because they fail to constitute a case \r\n  or controversy for which meaningful relief can be granted.Â  In the Interest \r\n  of Kaundra C., 318 S.C. 484, 486, 458 S.E.2d 443, 444 (Ct.

(the â€œAssociationâ€), and various individual directors and members of the Board of Directors, alleging the Board and the directors were negligent for improperly discharging their duties to maintain the Dockside facilities and for fiscal mismanagement.Â  They now appeal the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to both the Association and the individual directors.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nDockside is a residential, waterfront condominium community situated on the Charleston Harbor consisting of an eighteen-story building and twenty-one townhouses.Â  The developers eventually transferred control of Dockside to the non-profit corporation, the Association, which was controlled by an elected Board of Directors.Â  Since that time, the Association, through its Board, assumed the duty to maintain Dockside, including maintaining the common areas and managing the fiscal affairs of the Association.Â  The individually named defendants[1] in the underlying lawsuit all served on the Board at various times during the 1990s.Â  \r\nThroughout that time period, the Board controlled the daily administration of Dockside, including normal maintenance and repairs, and any special situations warranting Board attention.Â  For example, the Board oversaw the settlement of a construction defect lawsuit, the damage caused by Hurricane Hugo, construction of Docksideâ€™s piers and bulkheads, and major renovations to the east and west walls of the condominium tower.Â  When addressing maintenance, repair, or financial decisions, the Board, through its individual directors, routinely sought advice and counsel from various outside professionals and consultants, including: the Associationâ€™s attorney, Arthur Rosenbloom; the Associationâ€™s accountant and CPA; the property manager; maintenance personnel; outside engineers; architects; plumbers; electricians; and general contractors.Â Â Â  \r\nIn 1999, the Board attempted to address Docksideâ€™s aging structures.Â Â  The Board consulted and hired a forensic architect, Myles Glick, to develop and implement a long-range maintenance plan for Docksideâ€™s structures.Â Â  Glick conducted an extensive investigation, reviewed prior architectural reports, and, on September 15, 2000, issued a detailed report informing the Board that the condominium structures suffered from water intrusion problems as a result of structural defects.Â  Dockside co-owners were informed about the structural problems and were presented with a proposed two-phase, $21,000,000 renovation plan at an ownerâ€™s meeting on March 6, 2001.Â  Glick later stated in his affidavit submitted at trial that the damage to Dockside was not caused by lack of routine maintenance and that the Board could not have known about the extent of the structural problems during the 1990s because the structural damage was not visible until the outer stucco had been removed during Glickâ€™s investigation.Â  \r\nOn December 31, 2001, Appellants filed the underlying action against the Association and individual past and present directors from the Board, alleging negligence and gross negligence in the performance of their duties, including maintenance, making repairs, and managing Association funds.Â  The Board presented all the co-owners a special assessment to cover the necessary repair costs on the associationâ€™s damaged structures in March 2002.Â  Although the pendency of Appellantsâ€™ lawsuit initially led the co-owners to delay approval of the special assessment, the co-owners eventually passed the special assessment and the repair work began.Â Â  \r\nAfter the dismissal of a separate federal declaratory judgment action brought by the Associationâ€™s liability insurance carrier, the Association and the individual directors moved for summary judgment in the underlying action on February 19, 2003.Â  The circuit court granted summary judgment to the individual directors, finding they discharged their duties in good faith, with care, and in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interest of the corporation.Â  Thus, the court found, the individual directors were protected from liability by South Carolina Code section 33-31-830.Â  The court denied summary judgment to the Association, finding the statute only applied to individual directors, not the corporation itself.Â  Upon motions for reconsideration filed by both sides, the circuit court granted summary judgment to the Association, finding the business judgment rule insulated the directors as well as the corporate entity from any liability.Â  The court denied Appellantsâ€™ motion for reconsideration.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, an appellate court must apply the same standard applied by a circuit court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 438-39 (2003).Â  Summary judgment is proper where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Baughman v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 114-15, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545 (1991).Â  In determining whether summary judgment is appropriate, the evidence and its reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Dawkins, 354 S.C. at 69, 580 S.E.2d at 439.Â  Because summary judgment is a drastic remedy, it should not be granted â€œuntil the opposing party has had a full and fair opportunity to complete discovery.â€Â  Id.Â  However, the nonmoving party must demonstrate that further discovery will likely uncover additional relevant evidence and that the party is not attempting to engage in a â€œfishing expedition.â€Â  Id.; Baughman, 306 S.C. at 112, 410 S.E.2d at 544.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Individual Directors\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court improperly granted summary judgment to the individual directors because the court misinterpreted and misapplied section 33-31-830.Â  We disagree. \r\nSection 33-31-830 provides the applicable standard of care for directors of non-profit corporations in the discharge of their duties.Â  The section provides:\r\n\r\nA director shall discharge his duties as a director, including his duties as a member of a committee:\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        (1)\r\n        in good faith;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (2)\r\n        with the care an\r\n          ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under\r\n          similar circumstances; and\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (3)\r\n        in a manner the director\r\n          reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-31-830(a) (Supp. 2004). Â The section clarifies the general standard by expressly allowing directors to rely on outside sources for guidance, providing, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nIn discharging his or her duties, a director is entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, if prepared or presented by:\r\n(1) one or more officers or employees of the corporation who the director reasonably believes is reliable and competent in the matters presented;\r\n(2) legal counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters the director reasonably believes are within the personâ€™s professional or expert competence.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-31-830(b) (Supp. 2004).Â  However, where a director has other knowledge that makes a directorâ€™s reliance on outside experts unwarranted, the director is not acting in good faith.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-31-830(c) (Supp. 2004).Â  Subsection (d) states the following â€œsafe harborâ€ provision: â€œA director is not liable to the corporation, a member, or any other person for any action taken or not taken as a director, if the director acted in compliance with this section.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-31-830(d) (Supp. 2004).Â  \r\nThe official comments to section 33-31-830 demonstrate the legislatureâ€™s intention to provide considerable deference to the informed decisions of directors of a nonprofit corporation:Â  â€œThe directors need not be right, but they must act with common sense and informed judgment.Â  The duty of care recognizes that directors are not guarantors of the success of investments, activities, programs, or grants.Â  It allows leeway and discretion in exercising judgment.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-31-830, cmt. 2.Â  Comment two suggests a degree of deference be employed in a courtâ€™s review of director decisions:Â  â€œA court should not be harsh in second guessing directors who in good faith make a judgment that proves incorrect.Â  Although some decisions turn out to be unwise or the result a mistake of judgment, it is unreasonable to reexamine these decisions with the benefit of hindsight.â€\r\nThe statute clearly provides protection to a director who, acting in good faith, makes informed decisions in exercising his or her judgment.Â  Once the requirements of section 33-31-830 are met, it precludes review or second-guessing of the directorâ€™s decisions.Â  In the present case, the undisputed evidence shows the individual directors consulted with various professionals when confronted with financial or construction issues relating to the Association.Â  The types of experts consulted corresponded with the issues the Board sought to resolve.Â  For example, the directors sought advice from attorneys for legal questions, accountants and CPAs for financial questions, and architects for construction issues.Â  Because there was undisputed evidence that the directors sought outside advice in order to make informed maintenance and financial decisions for the Association, the individual directors were protected from liability.Â  \r\nAppellants, nevertheless, argue that the individual directorsâ€™ reliance upon experts was â€œunreasonableâ€ because they had outside knowledge of the maintenance problems at Dockside.Â  Thus, Appellantâ€™s argue, the directors did not comply with the statute, were not immune from liability, and were not entitled to summary judgment.Â  Knowledge of the maintenance problems alone is not sufficient to remove the immunity provided by section 33-31-830(d).Â  The burden to prove the directors did not act in good faith, and their reliance upon experts was not in good faith, was on Appellants.Â  See Dockside Assâ€™n, Inc. v. Detyens, 294 S.C. 86, 87, 362 S.E.2d 874, 874 (1987) (reviewing a boardâ€™s protection under the business judgment rule, the court held that the burden was on the party challenging the boardâ€™s actions to prove a lack of good faith in the exercise of judgment, not upon the board to prove good faith).Â  Although Appellants offered their affidavits and the affidavit of one expert opining that there were maintenance problems at Dockside that could have been handled differently, no evidence was offered indicating the directorsâ€™ reliance upon experts was misplaced.Â  \r\nTherefore, we hold the undisputed facts established compliance with section 33-31-830(b).Â  By relying upon the advice of various individuals with particular professional competence and expertise, as a matter of law, the individual directors discharged their duties in good faith, with the care of an ordinarily prudent person and in the best interest of Dockside.Â  Because compliance with this statute provides immunity from liability, we hold the grant of summary judgment to the individual directors was proper.[2]Â  Moreover, the common law business judgment rule would protect the respondents notwithstanding their alleged noncompliance with section 33-31-830.Â  \r\nII.Â  The Corporation\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court improperly granted summary judgment to the corporate entity, the Association, because corporations do not have protection under the business judgment rule.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe business judgment rule â€œprecludes judicial review of actions taken by a corporate governing board absent a showing of a lack of good faith, fraud, self-dealing or unconscionable conduct.â€Â  Dockside Assâ€™n, Inc., v. Detyens, 294 S.C. at 87, 362 S.E.2d at 874.Â  Although there are no cases directly on point, our state courts have implied the business judgment rule applies to corporate entities.Â  In Seabrook Island Property Owners Association v. Pelzer, 292 S.C. 343, 356 S.E.2d 411 (Ct. App. 1987), a landowner appealed the grant of summary judgment to the homeowners association in an action to collect unpaid assessments.Â  In reversing the grant of summary judgment to the association, the court noted that although the business judgment rule would apply to corporate actions taken pursuant to the bylaws and covenants, it would not apply to protect the corporation from acts outside the corporationâ€™s authority.Â  Seabrook Island, 292 S.C. at 347-48, 356 S.E.2d at 414 (â€œThe â€˜business judgment ruleâ€™ applies to intra vires action of the corporation, not to ultra vires acts.â€); see Cedar Cove Efficiency Condo. Assâ€™n, Inc. v. Cedar Cove Prop., Inc., 558 So. 2d 475, 479 (Fla. Ct. App. 1990) (applying the business judgment rule to homeowners associationâ€™s decisions on maintenance, repair, and assessment issues).Â  \r\nFurther, since a corporation may only act through its directors, the application of the business judgment rule to the corporate entity with regard to the business judgments of the directors is appropriate.[3]Â  See Chapman-Storm Lumber Corp. v. Minnesota-South Carolina Land &amp; Timber Co., 183 S.C. 31, 34, 190 S.E. 117, 118 (1937) (noting that where a corporation and its agent are sued together for the act of the agent and the agent is found to be without blame, the corporation cannot be held liable for the agentâ€™s conduct).Â  \r\nIn the instant case, the suit against the Association and the individual directors only complained about the actions of the individual directors.Â  No evidence was produced at the summary judgment hearing to show the Association was separately negligent.Â  Accordingly, we find the business judgment rule precludes judicial review of the action taken by the Board, and, thus, the circuit court correctly granted summary judgment to the Association.Â  \r\nIII. Discovery\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment because they did not have a full and fair opportunity to conduct discovery.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs previously discussed, summary judgment is a drastic remedy and should not be granted where the nonmoving party has not had the opportunity to conduct discovery.Â  Dawkins, 354 S.C. at 69, 580 S.E.2d at 439.Â  The burden is upon the nonmoving party, however, to show that further discovery will likely uncover additional relevant evidence, the request for further discovery is not an attempt to engage in a fishing expedition, and the nonmoving party was not dilatory in pursuing discovery.Â  Id.; Baughman, 306 S.C. at 112, 410 S.E.2d at 544.Â  \r\nThe litigation in this case began in December 2001 when Appellants filed the underlying action.Â  In July 2002, the Association and the individual directors responded to Appellantsâ€™ discovery requests by answering interrogatories and providing Appellants with access to over 50,000 documents, including Association minutes, every file maintained on all homeowners, all financial records, a list of all current and former directors, and a list of the Associationâ€™s experts.Â  The separate federal lawsuit between the Association and its liability carrier was filed in December 2002.Â  Thereafter, the Association and individual directors filed motions to compel, for a more definite statement, and for summary judgment.Â  Appellants then moved for a stay of the underlying litigation pending the outcome of the federal suit on February 27, 2003, but it does not appear from the record that the circuit court ever ruled upon this motion.Â  The federal court issued a declaratory judgment that the Associationâ€™s liability carrier had a duty to defend the underlying action on April 3, 2003.Â  \r\nThe Association and the individual directors thereafter filed a memorandum in support of the motion for summary judgment on July 1, 2003, and Appellants served deposition notices on July 3, 2003.Â  A hearing on the motion for summary judgment was held July 9, 2003, and the circuit court granted summary judgment to the individual directors.Â Â  \r\nInitially, this issue is not preserved for review.Â  Although Appellants mentioned in their memorandum in opposition to the motion for summary judgment that granting the motion was premature because discovery was pending, the circuit court order granting summary judgment to the individual directors did not address the issue of adequacy of discovery.Â  Appellants did not point out the failure to address the question of adequacy of discovery in their motion for reconsideration.Â  Further, Appellants did not attempt to protect their interests by requesting a continuance until discovery could be completed.Â  Because this question was never ruled upon by the circuit court, it is not preserved for appellate review.Â  Degenhart v. Knights of Columbus, 309 S.C. 114, 118, 420 S.E.2d 495, 497 (1992) (noting that the question of whether summary judgment was premature pending a ruling on an outstanding motion to compel discovery was not preserved where the party opposing summary judgment did not move for a continuance pending the outcome of the motion to compel and the issue was never ruled upon by the court).Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In any event, this argument fails on the merits.Â  Appellants argue that they did not have enough time to review the thousands of pages of documents submitted by the Association and the individual directors, that the discovery process was halted pending the federal lawsuit, and that further discovery would reveal that the individual directors were grossly negligent.Â  Appellants were aware of the names of the individual directors nearly a year before the summary judgment hearing, but they did not move to depose individual directors until after the motion for summary judgment was filed.Â  Further, although Appellants filed a motion to stay the state court proceedings pending the outcome of the federal proceedings, nothing in the record indicates that motion was ever ruled upon.Â  Appellants give no real justification for the delay in deposing witnesses, and they merely argue that they may find information to prove the individual directors grossly negligent.Â  We find Appellants have failed to meet their burden to show that summary judgment was premature.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nTherefore, the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] The Respondents Douglas Berlinsky, Wilbur Burbage, II, Francis G. Cain, Jr., Lydia P. Davidson, William B. Ellison, Grant D. Small; James F. Spann, and Jonathan L. Yates all served as directors at some time from 1990-1999.\r\n[2]Â  The General Assembly has provided further protection to directors of nonprofit corporations by enacting South Carolina Code section 33-31-834.Â  That section provides that directors of nonprofit organizations are immune from suits arising from the conduct of the affairs of the organization unless the directorsâ€™ conduct amounts to â€œwillful, wanton, or gross negligence.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-31-834 (Supp. 2004).Â  Although this section was presented to the circuit court to further support the individual directorsâ€™ motion for summary judgment, the court did not rely upon this section in ruling.Â  \r\n[3]Â  In finding our courts recognize application of the business judgment rule to corporate entities, we focus only on the exercise of due care in making routine business judgments for the benefit of the corporation.Â  Our finding does not extend the business judgment rule to protect corporations from tort liability or for actions taken outside the scope of the corporationâ€™s authority, with corrupt motive, or in bad faith.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
