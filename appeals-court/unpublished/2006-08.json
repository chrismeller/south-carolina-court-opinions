Culbertson, Master in Equity\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No.2006-UP-314\r\nSubmitted June 1, 2006 â€“ Filed August 3, 2006Â Â Â \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nRobert L. Widener and Robert W. Dibble, both of Columbia, for Appellant-Respondents\r\nDavid W. Keller, John Ravenel Chase, John Rogers Kirven, all of Florence; and John H. Tiller, of Charleston, for Respondents\r\nKenneth L. Mitchum, of Georgetown, for Respondent-Appellant\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Martha Williams, Betty Rapp, and other relatives of the late Wiley J. McKain, Jr. filed a petition to set aside McKainâ€™s 1998 will on the grounds of undue influence and lack of testamentary capacity.Â  The Master-in-Equity upheld the contested will.Â  This appeal followed.Â  We affirm.[1]Â Â Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn December 29, 2001, Wiley J. McKain, Jr. died at the age of 90.Â Â  McKainâ€™s Last Will and Testament, dated July 9, 1998 (the 1998 Will), was submitted to probate.Â  The 1998 Will bequeathed all of McKainâ€™s property, including approximately 735 acres along the Black River in Georgetown County valued at around $4,000,000, to James Weaver, a long-time friend. \r\nBy all accounts, McKain was an eccentric person.Â  McKain resided on his Black River property in living accommodations that were primitive and unhygienic.Â  He originally lived in a wood-sided shack with no running water.Â  Later he lived in trailers, which he also kept in unsanitary conditions.Â  \r\nDespite his eccentric way of life, McKain appeared to have lived the life he wanted.Â  He dearly loved his Black River property and rarely left.Â  Indeed, McKainâ€™s Black River property was his life.Â  His primary source of income was derived from the rental of lots and timber sales from his property.Â  McKain came to know many of his tenants well through encounters that would occur on his frequent walks, or as he called them â€œstretches,â€ around his property.Â  McKain had a proclivity for telling outlandish stories.Â  For example, McKain frequently commented about large alligators living around his property.Â  He often used this topic as a signal that he was ready to end a conversation.Â Â Â  \r\nIn 1971, McKain was involuntarily committed to the state mental hospital.Â  McKain contested his commitment and was discharged in less than sixty days.Â  Attorney Thomas E. Smith, Jr., represented McKain in contesting his commitment.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn 1991, Rapp, McKainâ€™s niece, became concerned about McKainâ€™s mental and physical health.Â  Specifically, Rapp was afraid the Wymans, tenants who supposedly helped run McKainâ€™s property, were taking advantage of McKain.Â  Rappâ€™s concerns led her to ask Dr. Theodore Gagliano to examine McKain.Â  On October 5, 1991, Dr. Gagliano examined McKain and concluded McKain was â€œgravely disabled and incompetent both as to person and estate.â€Â  Based on Dr. Gaglianoâ€™s findings, Rapp filed an action petitioning the probate court to have guardians and conservators appointed for\r\nMcKain.&nbsp; \r\nOn October 8, 1991, the probate court appointed Rapp as temporary guardian and appointed Dr. Gagliano to reexamine McKain.Â  A deputy with the Georgetown Sheriffâ€™s office brought McKain to Dr. Gaglianoâ€™s office for a second examination on October 15, 1991.Â  Dr. Gagliano found McKainâ€™s thinking was â€œgrossly flawed and his conclusions [were] invalid being based on delusions, projections and other distortions of ideation.â€Â  Gagliano further opined that McKain suffered from â€œSchizophrenia, paranoid type, chronic moderate, complicated by Primary degenerative dementia of the Alzheimer type, senile onset;â€ was â€œactively psychotic;â€ had â€œgrossly defective judgment;â€ was â€œincompetent as to both person and estate;â€ and these disorders were â€œchronic and irreversible.â€Â  After a hearing, the probate court issued an order continuing Rapp as McKainâ€™s temporary guardian during the pendency of the action for a permanent guardian and conservator.Â  \r\nMcKain subsequently contested the appointment of Rapp as his guardian and conservator.Â  In February 1992, the parties reached a compromised settlement, and the probate court appointed Alston C. Badger, a relative and an attorney, and H. McRoy Skipper, a local CPA, as co-guardians and co-conservators.Â  The probate courtâ€™s order specifically provided McKain â€œagrees by reasons of advanced age, that he lacks the ability to effectively manage all of his affairs without assistance . . . .â€Â  \r\nAs a result of the various actions taken against him, McKain came to hold some resentment toward his relatives.Â  McKainâ€™s tenuous relationship with his relatives was common knowledge as he was often visibly upset after visiting with some family members.Â  Moreover, McKain executed a Last Will and Testament in 1991 (the 1991 Will), leaving 100 acres of his Black River property to non-relatives, the Wymans, and notably excluding Rapp and Williams.Â  \r\nIn contrast, McKain grew fonder of Weaver over the years.Â  Weaver and McKain first met in December 1972 when Weaverâ€™s father-in-law, Stanley White, inquired about renting property along the Black River.Â  Over the years, Weaver visited the Black River property often and developed a close personal relationship with\r\nMcKain.&nbsp; \r\nIn March 1993, McKain, through Smith, filed a motion requesting the removal of Badger and Skipper as co-guardians and co-conservators.Â  Subsequently, Skipper resigned as co-guardian and co-conservator, and McKain agreed to withdraw his petition to terminate the guardian and conservatorship if Weaver could be named co-guardian and co-conservator.Â  By order dated March 28, 1994, the court gave effect to this agreement.Â  Thereafter, Badger generally tended to McKainâ€™s financial affairs and Weaver tended to McKainâ€™s day-to-day care.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn May 1995, McKain became ill.Â  Weaver took him to see a doctor, who ordered McKain to be hospitalized.Â  When McKain was released from the hospital a week later, Weaver invited McKain to live with Weaver and his wife, Genevieve Weaver.Â  \r\nFor the next three years, McKain lived in the Weaversâ€™ home.Â  The Weavers considered McKain a family member and included him in their daily lives, family meals, and holiday gatherings.Â  Weaver also took McKain to visit his Black River property a couple of times.Â  McKain developed a fondness for his new home and even informed relatives that the Weaversâ€™ home was the â€œbest place he ever lived.â€Â  \r\nIn late 1994 or early 1995, McKain contacted Smith about revising his will.[2] Â In June 1995, Smith visited McKain in the hospital and discussed the preparation of a new will with him.Â  Smith prepared McKainâ€™s will shortly following the hospital visit; however, the will was not executed at that time.Â  \r\nOn July 9, 1998, Weaver drove McKain to Smithâ€™s office to execute a new will.Â  Smith discussed the contents of McKainâ€™s will with McKain in private; Weaver, at Smithâ€™s request, left the office.Â  After discussing the willâ€™s contents, McKain took a five minute â€œstretchâ€ in front of Smithâ€™s office; McKain was not approached by anyone during his â€œstretch.â€Â  Thereafter, McKain signed the will that is the subject of this action.Â  The 1998 Will is identical to the will Smith prepared in June 1995.Â  \r\nIn December 1998, McKain fell and broke his hip on the Weaversâ€™ property.Â  McKain was hospitalized for about a week and then moved to a rehabilitation center.Â  A couple of weeks later McKain moved to Commander Nursing Home, where he remained until he died on December 29, 2001.Â  \r\nMcKainâ€™s 1998 Will was submitted to probate and McKainâ€™s relatives (collectively â€œContestantsâ€) filed this action to set aside the 1998 Will on the grounds of undue influence and/or incapacity.Â  This action was filed against Weaver and all other parties entitled to claim under or through McKain, including the late Wilbur Cagle, who alleged he was McKainâ€™s biological son and potential intestate heir. Â The probate court transferred the case to the circuit court, which referred the case to the Master-in-Equity for Georgetown County.Â  After a hearing, the master issued an order upholding the validity of the 1998 Will.Â  Contestants filed motions pursuant to Rule 52 and Rule 59, which were summarily denied.Â  Cagle also filed motions pursuant to Rule 52 and Rule 59 alleging the master lacked subject matter jurisdiction to determine paternity. The master summarily denied Cagleâ€™s motions.Â  Contestants and Cagle appealed.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAn action to contest a will is an action at law.â€Â  In re Estate of Pallister, 363 S.C. 437, 447, 611 S.E.2d 250, 256 (2005).Â  â€œOn appeal from an action at law that was\r\ntried without a jury, the appellate court can correct errors of law, but the findings of fact will not be disturbed unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.â€Â  Blackmon v. Weaver, 366 S.C. 245, 249, 621 S.E.2d 42, 44 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp; Testamentary Capacity \r\nContestants argue McKain lacked testamentary capacity to execute the 1998 Will.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe opponent of a will bears the burden of proving a lack of testamentary capacity.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-407 (Supp. 2005).Â  â€œThe test of capacity necessary to make a will is whether the testator knew his estate, the objects of his affections and to whom he wished to give his property.â€Â \r\nHembree v. Estate of Hembree, 311 S.C. 192, 195, 428 S.E.2d 3, 4 (Ct. App. 1993).Â \r\nâ€œMoreover, the presumption arises upon proof of due execution of the will that the testator knew its contents and this is sufficient to establish testator knowledge thereof.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œ[T]he â€˜capacity to know or understand, rather than the actual knowledge or understanding, is sufficient.â€™â€Â  In re Estate of Weeks, 329 S.C. 251, 263, 495 S.E.2d 454, 461 (Ct. App. 1997) (quoting 94 C.J.S. Wills Â§ 15(c) (1956)).Â  This test for determining whether or not a person has sufficient mental capacity to dispose of his property by will does not include the proviso that he must have a reasonable basis on which to found his like or dislike of the natural objects of his bounty.Â  Id.Â  â€œThe fact alone that the testator disposed of property contrary to what others usually consider fair is not sufficient to declare his will void.â€Â  Hellams v. Ross, 268 S.C. 284, 290, 233 S.E.2d 98, 101 (1977).Â  Indeed, â€œthe right to make a will carries with it the right to disregard what the world considers a fair disposition of property.â€Â  Id.  \r\nWe find the evidence in the record supports the masterâ€™s finding of capacity.Â  First, the evidence establishes that McKain knew his estate consisted of his Black River property.Â  Several of McKainâ€™s tenants provided testimony that demonstrates McKain had intimate knowledge of his property, including knowledge of the boundaries, the survey markers, and the size and location of plats.Â  Moreover, before signing the 1998 Will, McKain informed Smith the will may not accurately reflect the actual size of his property because some of his land had been washed away by the river.Â  \r\nSecond, the record supports a finding that McKain knew the objects of his affection.Â  The record indicates that, although he was not always cordial, McKain recognized his relatives when they visited.Â  In addition, prior to executing the will, McKain further demonstrated knowledge of his relatives by explaining to Smith, â€œI canâ€™t trust [my property] with [my relatives], [Weaver] will do what I want done.â€Â  McKainâ€™s statement to Smith indicates McKain was aware of who his relatives were and was aware he was not leaving his property to his family.Â  Additionally, the evidence demonstrates McKain was aware he was devising his estate to Weaver.Â  As noted above, he specifically stated Weaver would manage the property as McKain would want.Â  McKain also questioned whether he should leave some property to one of Weaverâ€™s sons-in-law, but eventually decided Weaver could make that decision at a later point in time.Â  Smith testified he believed McKain was competent to make a will on the day of execution.Â  \r\nWe note evidence concerning McKainâ€™s reduced capacity to manage his affairs and eccentricity is not sufficient proof to invalidate the 1998 Will.Â  The probate courtâ€™s appointment of co-conservators and co-guardians for McKain has â€œno effect on the capacity of the protected person, except to the extent the order affects his estate or affairs.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-5-408(4) (1987).Â  Moreover, Dr. Gaglianoâ€™s finding McKain suffered from â€œSchizophrenia, paranoid type, chronic moderate, complicated by Primary degenerative dementia of the Alzheimer type, senile onsetâ€ and was â€œincompetent as to both person and estateâ€ in 1991 is not dispositive because â€œa prior determination of insanity is not conclusiveâ€ and â€œeven an insane person may execute a will if it is done during a sane interval.â€Â  Weeks, 329 S.C. at 264, 495 S.E.2d at 461.Â  \r\nFurther, the accounts of McKainâ€™s untidy and primitive living accommodations and eccentricity, including his suspicions of his relatives and his tendency to tell tall tales, are not sufficient to invalidate the 1998 Will.Â  â€œ[E]ccentricities, peculiarities, or deviation or departure from normal conduct do not of themselves render a person incompetent to make a will.â€Â  95 C.J.S. Wills Â§ 12 (2001).Â  A personâ€™s mind is presumed to be sound until the contrary is clearly proved no matter how great any eccentricity.Â  Weeks, 329 S.C. at 264, 495 S.E.2d at 461.\r\nBased on the above, we find the record provides ample evidence to establish McKain knew his estate, the objects of his affection, and to whom he wished to give his property.Â  Accordingly, we find the master did not err in concluding McKain did not lack testamentary capacity to execute the 1998 Will.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp; Undue Influence\r\nContestants next contend the 1998 Will was invalid based on undue influence.Â  We disagree. \r\nIn order for a court to invalidate a will for undue influence, the influence must be the kind of mental coercion that destroys the free agency of the testator and constrains him to do things that are against his free will, and that he would not have done if he had been left to his own judgment and volition.Â  Russell v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., 353 S.C. 208, 217, 578 S.E.2d 329, 333 (2003).Â  â€œIf the testator had the testamentary capacity to dispose of his property and was free and unrestrained in his volition at the time of making the Will, the influence that may have inspired it or some provision of it will not be â€˜undue influenceâ€™.â€Â  Last Will and Testament of Smoak, 286 S.C. 419, 424, 334 S.E.2d 806, 809 (1985).Â  The â€œmere existence of undue influence is not enough to vitiate a Will.â€Â  Russell, 353 S.C. at 217, 578 S.E.2d at 333.Â  â€œA mere showing of opportunity and even a showing of motive to exercise undue influenceâ€ does not support a claim for undue influence â€œunless there is additional evidence that such influence was actually utilized.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œGeneral influence is not enough.Â  A contestant must show that the influence was brought directly to bear upon the testamentary act.â€Â  Mock v. Dowling, 266 S.C. 274, 277, 222 S.E.2d 773, 774 (1976).Â  \r\nAs with the issue of testamentary capacity, once formal execution of a will is admitted or proved, a prima facie case in favor of the will is made out, and the burden is then on the contestants to prove undue influence.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-407 (Supp. 2005).Â Â  As a general rule, the party challenging an instrument on the basis of undue influence must present evidence that unmistakenly and convincingly shows the partyâ€™s will was overborne by the defendant or someone acting on his behalf.Â  Macauley v. Wachovia Bank of S.C., 351 S.C. 287, 299, 569 S.E.2d 371, 378 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  However, when a confidential relationship exists, a presumption of undue influence arises.Â  Howard v. Nasser, 364 S.C. 279, 288, 613 S.E.2d 64, 68-69 (Ct. App. 2005). Â â€œ[A]lthough the proponents of the will must present evidence in rebuttal, they do not have to affirmatively disprove the existence of undue influence.Â  Instead, the contestants of the will still retain the ultimate burden of proof to invalidate the will.â€Â  Id. at 288, 613 S.E.2d at 68-69; see Â§ 62-3-407 (â€œParties have the ultimate burden of persuasion as to matters with respect to which they have the initial burden of proof.â€).Â  â€œUndue influence must be shown by unmistakable and convincing evidence, which is usually circumstantial.â€Â  Russell, 353 S.C. at 217, 578 S.E.2d at 333.Â Â Â Â  \r\nAs Weaver was serving as McKainâ€™s guardian at the time of the execution of the 1998 Will, a presumption of undue influence arises.Â  However, there is ample evidence in the record to reasonably support a finding that McKainâ€™s 1998 Will was not procured by undue influence.Â  Certainly, as the master found, â€œMcKainâ€™s relation to Weaver was far more friendly, amicable and trusting than his relations with the other parties to this action.â€Â  McKain and Weaver had a long-term friendship that began in the early 1970s and lasted until McKainâ€™s death.Â  Also, in the final years of McKainâ€™s life, Weaver and his family treated McKain as part of their family: taking him into their home for three years, caring for him, including him in their daily lives and holidays, and regularly visiting him in the hospital and nursing home.Â  McKain even noted that the Weaversâ€™ home was the â€œbest place he ever lived.â€Â  In contrast, McKain was only periodically visited by his relatives and, over the years, grew more and more resentful of them.Â Â Â  \r\nFurthermore, though McKain resided with Weaver from 1995 through 1998, the evidence does not demonstrate Weaverâ€™s influence ever rose to the level of force or coercion.Â  McKain waited three years and had multiple meetings with Smith before executing his new will.Â  Furthermore, Weaver was not present at the time McKain executed his will.Â  In addition, McKainâ€™s relatives were not restricted from visiting McKain at the Weavers.Â Â Â  \r\nAccordingly, we find the evidence supports the masterâ€™s finding that the 1998 Will was not a product of undue influence.Â Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp; Motion to Reopen the Record \r\nContestants assert the master erred in refusing to reopen the record based on the evidence that twelve days after the briefing scheduled for the post-trial motions in this case, Smith appeared as counsel of record for Weaver in another case involving Wilbur Cagle versus Weaver, individually and as personal representative of McKainâ€™s estate.Â  Contestants allege Smithâ€™s representation of Weaver gives greater credibility to their theory that Smith and Weaver conspired to unduly influence McKain.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe decision whether to reopen a record for additional evidence is within the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  Wright v. Strickland, 306 S.C. 187, 188, 410 S.E.2d 596, 597 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  In Last Will and Testament of Smoak, 286 S.C. 419, 334 S.E.2d 806 (1985), the supreme court held a directed verdict should have been granted in favor of the beneficiary on the issue of undue influence where the beneficiaryâ€™s own attorney drafted the contested will.Â  We fail to see how evidence of Smithâ€™s subsequent representation of Weaver would make any difference to the outcome of this case.Â  Therefore, we find the master did not commit an abuse of discretion in refusing to reopen the record based on evidence Smith was representing Weaver in a separate action.Â  \r\nIV.&nbsp;&nbsp; Paternity of Cagle \r\nRespondent/Appellant Wilbur Cagle, now deceased, alleged he was McKainâ€™s biological son and potential intestate heir.Â  Cagleâ€™s personal representative contends the master lacked subject matter jurisdiction to make findings regarding paternity of Cagle.Â  As we have upheld the validity of the 1998 Will, which disposed of McKainâ€™s entire estate, we find Cagleâ€™s argument that he is a potential intestate heir is moot. Â See Byrd v. Irmo High School, 321 S.C. 426, 431, 468 S.E.2d 861, 864 (1996) (stating a case becomes moot when a judgment, if rendered, would have no practical legal effect upon the existing controversy, thus making it impossible for the reviewing court to grant effectual relief).Â Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the above stated reasons, the decision of the master isÂ Â  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, JJ. concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] McKain purportedly revoked the 1991 Will in July 1995.Â  The validity of McKainâ€™s revocation of the 1991 Will was not ruled upon by the master and is not before this court.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-315","title":"Thomas Construction Services v.

Â On September 27, 2000, Early forwarded to Rocketship a proposal to provide project management services.Â  The proposal specified Lincoln Harris would, among other services:Â  define the scope of the project, hire the architect, provide cost estimating, hold regular meetings prior to construction with Rocketship to review costs and schedule, award the contract to a general contractor, and control project costs.Â  The proposal also included some costs for development of a building suitable only for MG&amp;Câ€™s needs.Â  This portion of the project was handled by ESD, Inc., the architects brought on by Lincoln Harris.\r\nIn October 2000, Thomas Causey, the representative of Lincoln Harris assigned to the project, took the members of Rocketship on a tour of several sites developed by Lincoln Harris. Â The sites were examples of prior-use buildings being converted into office space.Â  In addition, by letter dated October 20, 2000, Causey specifically recommended Rocketship increase the size of its building from 17,000 to approximately 27,000 square feet in order to decrease the cost per square foot as well as the rent to be owed by MG&amp;C to Rocketship in the lease. \r\nA Work Letter dated October 23, 2000, contains the only agreement between Rocketship and Lincoln Harris.Â  The letter states â€œThis Work Letter, once executed by you, will serve as notice for us to proceed with implementation of the schematic design through ESD and the implementation of the Project Management Master Agreement that is attached.â€Â  The letter further noted: â€œAs discussed, Lincoln Harris will be responsible for managing the activities of ESD.â€Â  Finally, the letter set forth the fee arrangement and was signed by Causey on behalf of Lincoln Harris, and Jay Courie on behalf of MG&amp;C.Â  After the Work Letter was signed, Causey acted as project manager on behalf of Lincoln Harris.\r\nCausey introduced the members of Rocketship to Clay Elder, a principal in ESD, who would serve as the architect for the project.Â  In addition, Causey brought Jeff Thomas of Thomas Construction Services into the project to serve as general contractor. Â Â \r\nIn December 2000, Thomas Construction presented Rocketship with an interim construction contract based upon a conceptual budget of $3 million.Â  The contract further stipulated that as the drawings were developed, a more detailed cost would be ascertained. Â Pursuant to the interim contract, Thomas began demolition work on the old Tappâ€™s building.Â  A subsequent proposal included a parking garage for $3.5 million for a total budget of $7 million. \r\nOn March 20, 2001, Causey and Thomas held a phone conference with James R. Goudelock, a partner in MG&amp;C and Rocketship.Â  During the conference, Goudelock took notes to memorialize the discussion.Â  The notes indicate the parties agreed upon a 29,550 square foot building for a price of $3.1 million.Â  The notes do not indicate whether specific designs, finishes, or materials were discussed.\r\nOn March 28, 2001, Thomas sent another construction contract to Rocketship. Â The contract included the following provisions:\r\n\r\n. . . .\r\n3.1Â Â Â Â  Subject to additions and deductions by the Change Order, the Contract Sum is:Â  Building - $3,100,000.00 Three Million One Hundred Thousand and no/100 dollars.Â  Project Conceptual Budget (see Attachment B-2). \r\n. . . . \r\nArticle 6Â Â Â Â  Scope of Work is not outlined to date by drawings, etc.Â  Thomas Construction will begin demolition of existing building interiors immediately.Â  Compensation will be cost of work plus 12% fee.Â  As drawings are developed a detailed cost and lump sum will be developed.Â  \r\n\r\nThe contract included Attachment B-2, which was labeled â€œConceptual Budgetâ€ and totaled $3.1 million for the construction bid.Â  \r\nGoudelock made several hand written changes to the contract.Â  In section 3.1, Goudelock added the following provision to the language of Thomasâ€™ contract:Â  â€œContract Sum shall be this amount, or it shall be lesser amount if cost of work including 12% fee is lesser amount at time of project completion.Â  See Article 6 below.â€ \r\nIn Article 6 he added the following language to Thomasâ€™ contract:Â  â€œSee Article 3 above.Â  Contract Sum shall be $3,100,000.00 or cost of actual work including 12% fee, whichever is lesser amount.Â  Contractor understands that Lincoln-Harris Properties will act on behalf of Owner as a construction project manager to the extent authorized by Owner.â€Â  Goudelock did not remove any of the language regarding the alteration of the budget based on final drawings. \r\nGoudelock included the altered contract in a letter to Causey dated April 19, 2001.Â  The letter stated:Â  \r\n\r\nPlease find enclosed the original signed construction contract, along with copies of the plans that I have initialed for you [Causey], Clay [Elder], and Jeff [Thomas].Â  As you might expect from an attorney, I made a few alterations in a couple of places in the contract.Â  If there are any questions about these, please have [Thomas] let me know. \r\n\r\nCausey delivered the letter and altered contract to Thomas and instructed Thomas to call Goudelock if there were any problems.Â  Goudelock believed all parties were operating under the same belief that the project would be completed for a maximum price of $3.1 million.Â  \r\nThomas did not contact Goudelock regarding the changes in the contract.Â  Thomas discussed the changes with Causey and expressed concerns regarding the fairness of the changes. Â Causey informed him that things would work out and that they could see where they stood once the final drawings were made and bids collected. Â Causey testified he believed he called Goudelock and left a voicemail indicating Thomas would be calling regarding the changes to the contract.Â  He testified the call may not have been immediately upon learning of Thomasâ€™ concerns but could have been the next day.Â Â  \r\nThomas continued to operate under the contract.Â  He stated he believed that â€œif the final drawings reflected 3.1 million dollars worth of work, so be it.Â  If they reflected 4 million dollars worth of work, we were going to sit down and have a discussion about it and either work out the difference or in fact change the contract to suit the difference.â€ Â Goudelock continued with the project with the belief that Causey, Elder, and Thomas would work to produce a building that was in line with their March 20, 2001, discussion and would come in at or below a cost of $3.1 million.\r\nOn May 30, 2001, Rocketship closed on its bond financing.Â  The bond financing required significant upfront costs as well as payment of interest. Â Â \r\nThroughout the summer of 2001, the parties worked to complete final schematic drawings for the building including the materials and fixtures to be used.Â  During the process, Rocketship was kept informed of how the design was progressing by Causey. Â Rocketship was under the belief that the estimated costs, based on the designs being developed, would be under the $3.1 million contract cost. Â Â \r\nThe final drawings were completed in September 2001 by Elder. Â The drawings, known as the red-edged drawings, were for a larger building than discussed in the March 20 meeting and included many high-end fixtures and materials.Â  The construction bids came in at $4.3 million originally, and were subsequently reduced to slightly less than $3.8 million based on the September drawings.Â  Causey presented the total of the bids to Rocketship on October 22, 2001. Â The final price was unacceptable to\r\nRocketship. \r\nLincoln Harris, Elder, and Thomas began the process of value engineering the project in order to reduce the cost to the $3.1 million requirement.Â  On October 26, 2001, Goudelock wrote a letter to Lincoln Harris Senior Vice President Ron Steen.Â  In the letter, he stated:Â  \r\n\r\nI appreciate your efforts in trying to address the budgeting issues that have arisen regarding the construction of our building.Â  Pursuant to our discussion, you stated that approximately two weeks were needed to try and arrive at a potential resolution to this problem.Â  We agreed to proceed with this approach provided our firm does not incur any charges or expenses for the efforts taking place and, further, that the cost to us for this time delay are reimbursed. \r\n\r\nThe first result was a cost of $3,677,890.00 to complete the larger 34,000 square foot building depicted in the red-edged drawings instead of the 29,500 square foot building discussed in March.Â  Thomas also proposed deducting one floor and other changes for a bid price of $3,098,500 or making those changes but adding other features for a price of $3,212,545.00.Â  Lincoln Harris also brought in Shelco, Inc. another contractor, to review the project.Â  While its bid was not firm and was subject to some variation, Shelco believed it could create a building similar to one it already completed in Greenville for $2.6 million in addition to the $431,000 already spent.Â  None of these alternatives were considered by\r\nRocketship.\r\nAdditionally, Thomas made a proposal to construct the building for approximately $3.2 million based on the size discussed at the March meeting.Â  However, when Thomas was unable to secure a performance bond, Rocketship refused to go forward. \r\nIn November, Rocketship sent a letter to Lincoln Harris and Thomas demanding they build the project for the agreed upon price of $3.1 million.Â  When neither party responded, Rocketship terminated the agreement.Â  Rocketship signed an agreement to work with Elder and ESD to value engineer the building. Â A new contractor, Mashburn Construction, was hired.Â  However, ESD was unable to create a project that met Rocketshipâ€™s demands.Â  Rocketship ordered Mashburn and ESD to stop all activities with the building. Â Rocketship later sold the property to the City of Columbia for $1.4 million.Â  \r\nThomas filed a mechanicâ€™s lien on the property of Rocketship.Â  Thomas sued to enforce the lien, and Rocketship filed a third-party complaint against Lincoln Harris and Causey. Â Rocketshipâ€™s complaint against Lincoln Harris and Causey raised claims of, among others, breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, fraudulent misrepresentation, and unfair trade practices.Â  Thomas and Rocketship settled before trial.Â  The remaining parties agreed to a trial without a jury.Â  At trial Rocketship sought to recover all monies paid to the contractor, architect, and for financing costs.Â  The trial court dismissed the claims for fraudulent misrepresentation and unfair trade practices during the trial. Â The parties submitted post-trial briefs on the remaining issues.Â  \r\nThe trial court found in favor of Lincoln Harris and Causey on all causes of action. Â In addition, the trial court specifically held Lincoln Harris and Causeyâ€™s actions were not the proximate cause of Rocketshipâ€™s alleged damages. Â The court concluded:\r\n\r\nSimply put, Rocketship never solved the basic development problems with the property:Â  (1) the land was too expensive for the size building MG&amp;C needed; (2) the business plan relied on significantly over-market rental rates; (3) the Project was under financed; (4) parking issues were never resolved; and (5) the building site was unattractive.Â  \r\n\r\nThe court further held Rocketship never demonstrated the ability to complete the project, even at $3.1 million, because it lacked significant funding due to its decision to pay soft costs out of the bond financing. Â Finally, the court found the termination of the project was based on Rocketshipâ€™s determination that the project was a â€œbad pure investmentâ€ when using realistic numbers for rental rates and income.Â  \r\nNeither party filed a motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis is an action at law.Â  See Sterling Dev. Co. v. Collins, 309 S.C. 237, 240, 421 S.E.2d 402, 404 (1992) (â€œAn action for breach of contract seeking money damages is an action at law.â€); Bivens v. Watkins, 313 S.C. 228, 230, 437 S.E.2d 132, 133 (Ct. App. 1993) (finding actions for negligent misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty are at law).Â  â€œIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.â€ Townes Assocs. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  â€œThe judgeâ€™s findings are equivalent to a juryâ€™s findings in a law action.â€Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe trial court ruled the actions of Lincoln Harris and Causey, even if they constituted a breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, or a negligent misrepresentation, were not the proximate cause of Rocketshipâ€™s damages.Â  Specifically, the court found Rocketshipâ€™s damages were caused by (1) the expense of the land relative to the building needs; (2) reliance upon â€œover-market rental ratesâ€ of almost $9 per square foot over market rates; (3) the project being â€œunder financedâ€ by almost $1.4 million (4) parking issues; (5) and the building site being â€œunattractive.â€ Â Finally, the court found:Â  â€œThe conclusion of a â€˜bad pure investmentâ€™ led to the cancellation of the projectâ€ and, therefore, the court found Lincoln Harris and Causey were not liable for any of the damages.Â  \r\nRocketship never specifically challenged the grounds discussed by the trial court for why the project was not completed.Â  Rocketship has also failed to explain in its brief how those grounds did not cause the termination of the project or how Lincoln Harris and Causeyâ€™s actions were the â€œsole proximate causeâ€ of the damages sought by Rocketship.Â  The only times the issue is marginally addressed is in conclusory comments regarding other issues.Â  For example, Rocketship stated:Â  â€œLincoln Harrisâ€™s and Causeyâ€™s actions were the sole proximate cause of Rocketshipâ€™s damages, being out of pocket approximately $1.4 million, with a partially completed building that could not be constructed for its $3.1 million budget.â€Â  We find Rocketship failed to meet its burden of proving the trial court erred in its conclusions regarding proximate cause. Â See Weaver v. Recreation Dist., 328 S.C. 83, 88, 492 S.E.2d 79, 82 (1997) (stating the trial courtâ€™s findings come to the appellate court with a presumption of correctness, and the burden is on the appellant to demonstrate reversible error).Â  \r\nFurthermore, we find the trial courtâ€™s findings and conclusions are supported by the evidence.Â  Ordinarily, the issue of proximate cause is a question of fact for finder of fact, in this case, the trial court.Â  See McNair v. Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, 349, 499 S.E.2d 488, 497 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  \r\nAs the trial court noted, the Rocketship members knew on March 29, 2001, that the project was not a good investment.Â  In an email from that date, Goudelock noted that MG&amp;C would have to pay Rocketship $25 per square foot in rent.Â  This figure is $9 per square foot over the market rate for Columbia.[1]Â  In response to this e-mail, one of the partners, Jay Courie, stated: â€œExcuse me while I throw up.Â  My gut tells me to scrap this deal and find some 16$ space to lease.Â  I can save without being forced.â€Â  Similarly, another partner, Hugh McAngus, wrote: â€œI wish we could sell it to someone.â€Â  \r\nThe parking issues were also an uncontested obstacle in the projectâ€™s development. Rocketship entered into a parking lease agreement to provide 60 nighttime (6 p.m.-8 a.m.) parking spaces for 40 years.Â  This allowed for only 8 parking spaces to be available to Rocketshipâ€™s tenant between 6 p.m. and 8 a.m.Â  Rocketship attempted to entice the City of Columbia into contributing to the construction of a parking garage on Rocketshipâ€™s property.Â  In their proposal to the City, Rocketship acknowledged that the property had insufficient parking to support a 30,000 square foot building.Â  Rocketship admitted the parking lease â€œadversely affects [Rocketshipâ€™s] ability to appropriately utilize its building in a commercially reasonable manner, and makes it unfeasible to go forward with the project unless additional parking can be procured.â€Â Â  \r\nThe city declined to participate in the project.Â  A member of the Cityâ€™s Economic Development division noted that considering what Rocketship paid for the property and what it would cost to build the proposed office building and the current rental rates, â€œit will be difficult for the firm to carry the cost of the project.â€Â  He also noted, â€œDue to the high purchase price, $1.3 million[,] and the size of the property, [Rocketship] is unable to create a development scenario that will work.â€Â Â  \r\nThe record also supports the trial courtâ€™s holding that the project was under financed.Â  Goudelock acknowledged that although the March 29 business plan identified a budget gap of $640,500, he had understated the amount and the true budget gap was closer to $1.4 million.Â  Rocketship offered no argument on appeal contesting the trial courtâ€™s holding that Rocketship would have had to borrow funds to cover this $1.4 million gap and â€œRocketship never demonstrated that additional funding to complete the project was available.â€Â  \r\nIn its February 12, 2002 business plan, Rocketship used a more reasonable rental income figure of $21 per square foot.Â  It also acknowledged that the property would not appraise for what it had in it.Â  It concluded the project was a â€œbad pure investment.â€Â  Rocketship stopped construction after making this conclusion.Â  \r\nIn addition, prior to Rocketshipâ€™s termination of the project, Thomas, Shelco, and Mashburn all presented possible solutions to Rocketship for completing the building very close to or at the required amount of $3.1 million.Â  All proposals were rejected by Rocketship without allowing the companies to more fully develop the proposals or to attempt to complete the building.Â  \r\nWe find the evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s ruling that Rocketshipâ€™s realization that the project was a â€œbad pure investment,â€ rather than any action by Lincoln Harris, led to its decision to cancel the project.Â  Thus we affirm the trial courtâ€™s ruling that Lincoln Harris cannot be held liable for Rocketshipâ€™s decision to cancel the project.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.[2]\r\nHUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, JJ. concur.\r\n\r\n[1]In their current lease, MG&amp;C agreed to pay $16.00 a square foot for the first year incrementally increasing to $18.02 a square foot in year 7 of the lease.Â  \r\n[2] As we affirm the trial courtâ€™s ruling that Lincoln Harrisâ€™s action were not the proximate cause of Rocketshipâ€™s claimed damages, we need not address Rocketshipâ€™s remaining issues.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-316","title":"State v.

Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Shawn L. Reeves, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Warren B. Giese, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:&nbsp;&nbsp; A jury convicted Tyrelle Davis of assault and battery with intent to kill.Â  Davis seeks a new trial, arguing the trial judge improperly limited cross-examination of the Stateâ€™s witnesses and improperly commented on defense counselâ€™s performance.Â  We find the trial judgeâ€™s comments to defense counsel[1] in the presence of the jury were improper and deprived Davis of a fair trial.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nI.\r\nOn July 1, 2004, â€œa youthâ€ approached Christopher Perry, the victim, and asked to purchase sixty dollars worth of crack cocaine.Â  According to Perry, he obtained the drugs from Davis with the understanding that Perry would keep twenty dollars of the proceeds from the sale.Â  Perry then attempted to sell the drugs to the youth, but the youth refused to buy them.Â  Perry was unable to sell the crack and did not have any proceeds from a sale when Davis came for his money.Â  Perry offered to give the drugs back to Davis, but, again according to Perry, he did not want the drugs.Â  Perry testified that Davis started to leave but then turned back to face Perry with a pistol.Â  As Perry attempted to get away, he was shot in the back.Â  There were material discrepancies between Perryâ€™s testimony and his initial statement to law enforcement.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nII.\r\nDavis argues the trial judge erred by improperly limiting the cross-examination of the Stateâ€™s witnesses and making highly inappropriate comments in the presence of the jury which deprived him of a fair trial.Â  After carefully reviewing the record, we find the trial judgeâ€™s alleged errors in limiting Davisâ€™s cross-examination do not rise to the level of reversible error.Â  We nevertheless find the trial judgeâ€™s comments in the presence of the jury about defense counselâ€™s ethics and competence crossed the line and deprived Davis of a fair trial. \r\nDuring the Stateâ€™s direct examination of Perry, Perry was clearly in custody, as he wore an orange suit and handcuffs.Â  The State sought to explain to the jury why Perry was in prison garb.Â  Upon questioning by the solicitor, Perry explained he had pending charges â€œfor crack.â€Â  Perry also had a pending charge of financial card theft.Â  Because the State opened the door concerning Perryâ€™s pending charges, defense counsel attempted to cross-examine Perry regarding the pending financial card theft charge.Â  The trial judge, however, sustained the Stateâ€™s objection, stating defense counsel could not question Perry about â€œa non-adjudicatedâ€ charge.Â Â Â  \r\nDefense counsel then asked Perry if he would like to hold his RAP sheet, and Perry replied that he did not.Â  Defense counsel asked, â€œAre you embarrassed by [your RAP sheet]?â€Â  The solicitor objected, and the trial judge sustained the objection, stating, â€œSustained.Â  Mr. Davis, donâ€™t -- let me tell you something, Sir.Â  I donâ€™t . . . . Mr. Davis, this isnâ€™t some crime drama on TV.Â  You know thatâ€™s not proper.â€Â Â  \r\nDuring direct examination, Perry offered his view about the evils of drugs.Â  On cross-examination, defense counsel attempted to pursue the matter by asking, â€œWell, why would you be out there trying to sell crack cocaine to some innocent person if you believe crack cocaine is so bad?â€Â  The trial judge sustained the solicitorâ€™s objection to this question, and stated, â€œMr. Davis, thatâ€™s not a proper area of inquiry.Â  Move onto another question.â€Â  \r\nThe trial judge erred in failing to allow defense counsel to cross-examine Perry on the financial card theft.Â  â€œ[W]hen a party introduces evidence about a particular matter, the other party is entitled to explain it or rebut it, even if the latter evidence would have been incompetent or irrelevant had it been offered initially.â€Â  State v. Foster, 354 S.C 614, 623, 582 S.E.2d 426, 431 (2003) (alteration in original) (quoting State v. Beam, 336 S.C. 45, 52, 518 S.E.2d 297, 301 (Ct. App. 1999)).Â  The State purposefully questioned Perry about his then current status as a prisoner.Â  When Perry was not forthright about the reasons for his detention, the door was opened to further examination on the matter.Â  Similarly, the door was opened to questions regarding the fact that Perry sold drugs.Â  The same result should follow Perryâ€™s self-serving testimony about the evils of drugs.Â  Standing alone, however, we find these errors harmless.Â  These rulings could not by any stretch be deemed to rise to the level of reversible error.Â  See State v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 176, 399 S.E.2d 595, 597 (1991) (noting that appellate courts will not set aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not affecting the result). \r\nThe trial judge correctly sustained the Stateâ€™s objection to defense counselâ€™s question regarding whether Perry was embarrassed by his RAP sheet.Â  The question was improper and the answer would have been irrelevant.\r\nIt is the trial judgeâ€™s gratuitous comments directed at defense counsel that give rise to the reversal of Davisâ€™s conviction and sentence.Â  A trial judge must act with absolute impartiality in the performance of judicial duties.Â  State v. Pace, 316 S.C. 71, 74, 447 S.E.2d 186, 187 (1994) (citing Canon 3, CJC, Rule 501, SCACR).\r\nIn Pace, the trial judge referred to defense counsel as a â€œpretty girlâ€ and a â€œnice girlâ€ in the presence of the jury.Â  Pace, 316 S.C. at 73, 447 S.E.2d at 187.Â  This court found the comments concerning counselâ€™s gender inappropriate, but affirmed Paceâ€™s conviction, concluding the error was not prejudicial.Â  The supreme court granted certiorari and reversed, holding that â€œ[r]eference by a trial judge to an attorneyâ€™s age, gender, or competence is improper and constitutes reversible error upon a showing of prejudice to the defendant.â€Â  Pace, 316 S.C. at 74, 447 S.E.2d at 187.Â  Our supreme court concluded that the gender related comments deprived Pace of a fair trial.\r\nWe believe a fair reading and application of Pace requires reversal here.Â  If the condescending comments concerning counselâ€™s gender crossed the line in Pace, then we believe the repeated comments concerning Davisâ€™s counselâ€™s competence and ethics also crossed the line. \r\nIf the trial judge had only made one improper comment, we would not find prejudice, because a criminal defendant is entitled to a fair trial, not a perfect one.Â  See, e.g., State v. Johnson, 334 S.C. 78, 93, 512 S.E.2d 795, 803 (1999).Â  Unfortunately, the trial judge continued throughout the trial to make demeaning comments to defense counsel in the presence of the jury, while remaining on an even keel with the solicitor.Â  \r\nWhen defense counsel cross-examined Perry regarding inconsistencies between his written statement and his trial testimony, defense counsel stated, â€œYou want to correct yourself every time.â€Â  The trial judge sustained the Stateâ€™s general objection and further stated:\r\n\r\n  Look, let me tell you.Â  Stop all of this, because -- as I told you all, Iâ€™ve been on a lot of cold medicine this weekend, and my patience is about to wear out with this kind of stuff.Â  Now, weâ€™re under certain rules as counsel about conducting ourselves in court with witnesses.Â  Iâ€™m going to remind both sides about that.Â  Iâ€™m going to leave it at that.Â  But Iâ€™m going to remind both sides once again about our code of ethics for treating witnesses and comments that are proper and not proper in front of a jury.\r\n\r\nAgain, our concern lies not with the underlying evidentiary ruling, but the trial judgeâ€™s comments.Â  Those additional comments in the presence of the jury were highly improper.Â  Although the judge stated he was directing his comments at both defense counsel and the solicitor, it is clear he was only chastising defense counsel.Â  His comments inappropriately speak to defense counselâ€™s perceived lack of ethics and competence as a lawyer.Â  \r\nThe State in its final brief seeks refuge in the contention that the judgeâ€™s comments â€œwere directed to both sides.â€Â  Respâ€™t Br. at 12.Â  The Stateâ€™s effort to soften the blow of the judgeâ€™s chastising comments finds no traction in the record.Â  Rather, the record shows the trial judge never challenged the competence or ethics of the prosecuting attorney.[2]\r\nDuring the direct examination of the investigating officer by the State, the officer was allowed to speculate as to how Perryâ€™s statement could say that four people shot at him (and thus explain an inconsistency in Perryâ€™s statement), over defense counselâ€™s objection.[3]Â  Later, however, defense counsel was not allowed to question the investigating officer regarding other inconsistencies in the report:\r\n\r\n  Defense counsel:Â  Okay.Â  All right.Â  And would it be fair to say in this report that Iâ€™ve been trying to hand you for about the last thirty minutes, it has no permanent ---\r\n  Solicitor:Â Â Â  Objection, Your Honor.\r\n  The Court:Â  Sustained.Â  Mr. Davis ---\r\n  Defense counsel:Â  Iâ€™ll move on, Your Honor.\r\n  The Court:Â  All right.Â  No more talk about TV shows and all.Â  Now, weâ€™ve gone over this same thing over and over again.Â  As long as I recall and Iâ€™m sure as long as you can recall, police incident reports are inadmissible.Â  You know that.Â  I know that.Â  Letâ€™s move on.Â  \r\n\r\nAt this point the ruling had been made.Â  Then, after further discussion the trial judge stated:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Davis, you know as well as I know that because heâ€™s the lead investigator does not mean that hearsay comes in.Â  Now, I donâ€™t know how they do things down in Moncks Corner.Â  But up here we do try to go by the rules of evidence.\r\n\r\nWe hold the trial judgeâ€™s comments to defense counsel were improper, prejudiced Davis, and constitute reversible error.Â  As stated in Pace, â€œ[t]he remarks of the court tended to impugn the credibility of counsel and to diminish him and his defense of appellant in the eyes of the jury.â€Â  316 S.C. at 74, 447 S.E.2d at 187 (1994) (quoting State v. Mitchell, 261 S.C. 452, 461, 200 S.E.2d 448, 453 (1973) (Justices Brailsford and Bussey, dissenting)).\r\nDavis chose not to testify at his trial and contends that he made this decision so that defense counsel could offer the closing argument.Â  Just as the prosecutorâ€™s credibility in the eyes of the jury is important, so is a defense attorneyâ€™s credibility.\r\nWe are sensitive to the substantial discretion accorded trial judges in the conduct of a trial.Â  The vagaries of litigation demand appellate deference to the burdens trial judges face daily from the bench.Â  Those very burdens, however, oftentimes require that trial judges exhibit extraordinary patience and restraint, especially in the presence of the jury.Â  When a judge impugns a defense attorneyâ€™s competence or ethics in the presence of the jury, the integrity of the process is undermined and, when prejudice is shown, the defendantâ€™s right to a fair trial is destroyed.Â  Here, the totality of the trial judgeâ€™s demeaning comments clearly and substantially diminished defense counselâ€™s credibility by implying counsel was incompetent and unethical.Â  \r\nAlthough defense counsel failed to raise an objection to the trial judgeâ€™s comments, we find â€œthe tone and tenor of the trial judgeâ€™s remarks . . . were such that any objection would have been futile.â€Â  Pace, 316 S.C. at 74, 447 S.E.2d at 187.Â  The circumstances of this case present an established exception to the general rule of issue preservation.Â  It is certain any challenge to the trial judgeâ€™s improper comments would have been overruled.Â  In fact, the trial judgeâ€™s remarks would have caused a reasonable attorney to believe that any objection would have resulted in a sanction.Â  Outside the presence of the jury, the trial judge informed defense counsel: â€œI donâ€™t know if you know, Sir, but I donâ€™t have a problem at all with fining a lawyer or jailing a lawyer,â€ and â€œI donâ€™t mind imposing sanctions. . . . Sometimes I tend to be a little heavy handed in that.â€Â  After additional admonishment, the trial judge made certain defense counsel understood his position by asking, â€œAre you and I clear?â€Â  Defense counsel responded, â€œClear, Your Honor.â€Â  It would be unreasonable to expect a lawyer to further challenge a trial judge after having been threatened with a fine or jail under these circumstances.Â  Further objection would have been futile.\r\nWe find the essential guarantee of a fair trial was infringed, and we reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial.\r\n REVERSED and REMANDED.\r\n WILLIAMS, J., concurs.\r\nSHORT, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n SHORT, J. (dissenting):Â  I concur with the majority that the trial judgeâ€™s alleged errors in limiting defense counselâ€™s cross-examination do not rise to the level of reversible error, however, I must respectfully dissent since I find the trial judgeâ€™s comments did not deprive the appellant of a fair and impartial trial.\r\nThe judgeâ€™s comments must be considered in the context in which they were made. Although the majority acknowledges that the judge directed his comments to both defense counsel and the solicitor in regard to the ruling wherein he referred to a code of ethics for attorneys to follow in treating witnesses and making comments, they contend the record shows he was not challenging the competence or ethics of the prosecuting attorney and he was only chastising defense counsel. The majority concludes the trial judgeâ€™s comments inappropriately speak to defense counselâ€™s perceived lack of ethics and competence as a trial lawyer. I disagree. These comments by the judge were in response to the statement by the defense counsel during cross-examination that witness Perry wanted to correct himself every time, and were directed at the defense counsel and the solicitor. By directing his comments to both defense counsel and the solicitor, the judge avoided any prejudice toward the appellant or his trial counsel.\r\nMost of the alleged improper comments by the trial judge were in response to defense counselâ€™s improper or inappropriate questions and comments. Likewise, most of the instances involving alleged prejudicial comments involved the trial judgeâ€™s ruling on specific evidentiary matters. Simply ruling against appellant on evidentiary matters does not constitute prejudicial error. See State v. Cooper, 334 S.C. 540, 547, 514 S.E.2d 584, 587 (1999). Defense counsel effectively cross-examined the victim and the investigating officer. He ably brought out the inconsistencies between the victimâ€™s written statement and his trial testimony. The credibility of the victim was the real issue in this case and the trial judgeâ€™s comments, when considered in the light of the context in which they were made, did not diminish defense counselâ€™s credibility to the extent that the appellant was denied a fair trial.\r\nAfter reviewing the statements made by the trial judge in the presence of the jury, I am unable to find any prejudice towards the appellant.Â  Generally there is no prejudice to the rights of a defendant when the trial courtâ€™s hostile comments are made outside of the juryâ€™s presence.Â  See Graves v. State, 309 S.C. 307, 311, 422 S.E.2d 125, 127 (1992).Â  The conduct of a criminal trial is generally left to the sound discretion of the presiding judge, and the appellate court will only interfere when it clearly appears that the rights of the complaining party were abused or prejudiced in some way. Cooper at 547, 514 S.E.2d at 588 (citing State v. Bridges, 278 S.C. 447, 298 S.E.2d 212 (1982)). Therefore, I dissent from the majorityâ€™s decision to reverse the trial court.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Appellate counsel did not represent Davis at trial.\r\n[2]&nbsp; The following are comments of the trial judge directed to defense counsel outside the juryâ€™s presence: â€œYouâ€™re about to wear out your welcomeâ€; â€œI donâ€™t know if weâ€™re seeing eye to eye yet or not.Â  I suspect if we donâ€™t, I feel comfortable Iâ€™ve given you fair enough warningâ€; â€œAgain, let me just make it clear that your problem is not whether youâ€™re here or in Moncks Corner or somewhere else.Â  All right.Â  Thereâ€™s a code of ethics that we all have to abide by. . . . And your behavior this afternoon in my court -- I think itâ€™s fairly clear -- falls very short of thatâ€; â€œI donâ€™t know if you know, Sir, but I donâ€™t have a problem at all with fining a lawyer or jailing a lawyerâ€; and â€œI donâ€™t mind imposing sanctions. . . . Sometimes I tend to be a little heavy handed in that.â€ Â These comments (outside the juryâ€™s presence) do not impact our decision to reverse.Â  State v. Cooper, 334 S.C. 540, 546, 514 S.E.2d 584, 587 (1999) (there is generally no prejudice when the trial courtâ€™s hostile comments are made outside the juryâ€™s presence).Â  The point is the solicitor was not subjected to these or similar comments.\r\n[3]&nbsp; Whether the trial judge erred in admitting the officerâ€™s speculative testimony is not properly before this court as the issue was not preserved for our review.Â  We merely highlight this ruling to illustrate the disparate treatment accorded defense counsel, especially when defense counsel sought to question the officer about inconsistencies in Perryâ€™s statement.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-317","title":"Wells Fargo Home Mortgage v.

Marcantel, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this mortgage foreclosure action, Thomasena and Albert Holloway (Appellants) appeal the special refereeâ€™s order of foreclosure and sale.Â  On appeal, Appellants argue: (1) the special referee lacked subject matter jurisdiction because they did not agree to a reference; (2) the special refereeâ€™s order is void for lack of notice; and (3) the special refereeâ€™s order is void because the mortgagor, Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc. (Wells Fargo), failed to supply written testimony before the special referee.[1]Â  We affirm.\r\nWe note at the inception that several orders have been entered in this case, but the appellants have only appealed the special refereeâ€™s â€œOrder and Judgment of Foreclosure and Saleâ€ dated August 17, 2004. Â While Appellants raise several issues regarding notice of the numerous hearings held by the special referee, the only issue that warrants our consideration relates to notice of the August 17, 2004 hearing. Â The record contains an August 5, 2004 notice of hearing and a certificate of service of the notice upon the appellants by mail dated the same date.Â  The special referee found Appellants received proper notice of the hearing. Â \r\nâ€œService by mail is complete upon mailing of all pleadings and papers subsequent to service of the original summons and complaint.â€ Â Rule 5(b)(1), SCRCP (2005); State v. Langston, 275 S.C. 439, 441, 272 S.E.2d 436, 437 (1980) (holding the presumption of delivery arises from evidence that a notice was properly mailed). Contrary to the claim of Appellants, the case of Tryon Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assoc. v. Phelps, 307 S.C. 361, 415 S.E.2d 397 (1992) does not require us to remand this case to the special referee for a determination of whether they received notice of the August 17, 2004 hearing. Â Unlike Tryon, the record in this case contains evidence of notice of the August 17, 2004 hearing. Â We therefore hold there is sufficient evidence to support the special refereeâ€™s conclusion that Appellants were properly served with notice of the August 17, 2004 hearing. \r\nAs to all remaining issues, we affirm the special referee pursuant to Rule 220, SCACR (2005), and the following authorities: Rule 53(b), SCRCP Â (2005) (â€œIn an action where the parties consent, in a default case, or an action for foreclosure, some or all of the causes of action in a case may be referred to a master or special referee by order of a circuit judge or the clerk of court.â€); Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (holding it is well-settled that a party may not raise an issue for the first time on appeal, but it must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court); Foggie v. CSX Transp., Inc., 315 S.C. 17, 23, 431 S.E.2d 587, 590 (1993) (stating orders affecting mode of trial must be appealed immediately); Ross v.

West,Â  23 S.C. 154, 160 (1885) (finding irregularities which do not involve jurisdiction do not render a judgment void); Town of Mt. Pleasant v. Jones, 335 S.C. 295, 299, 516 S.E.2d 468, 470 (Ct. App. 1999) (holding an unappealed order of the trial court â€œright or wrong, is the law of the caseâ€); In re Timmerman, 331 S.C. 455, 460, 502 S.E.2d 920, 922 (Ct. App. 1998) (stating when a party receives an order granting relief not requested of the court, he must move pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP to preserve the issue for appeal); Dibble v.

Walker, Jr. to prepare a subdivision survey plat of the property.Â  Initially, Walker provided Burry with a plat containing a line labeled â€œFlood Planeâ€ (sic) drawn across the numbered lots abutting the lake.Â  The line represented the elevation of the emergency spillway of the dam, 718 feet.Â  At Burryâ€™s request, Walker removed the line from the plat. Burry recorded the altered plat without the â€œFlood Planeâ€ line. \r\nOn August 21, 1990, Burry sold lot 14 to E.J. and Gail Neal by warranty deed.Â  About two years later, McConnell became interested in property surrounding Lake Beulah and called Burry to inquire about available lots.Â  Burry presented McConnell with the by-laws, property restrictions, and a copy of the recorded plat.Â  In October 1992, McConnell purchased lot 14 from the Neals.Â  McConnell applied for a building permit and began construction of his home in early 1994.Â  McConnellâ€™s home was substantially complete by April 22, 1994.Â  \r\nOn August 26, 1995, McConnellâ€™s property was flooded as the waters of Lake Beulah rose to five feet inside the first floor of McConnellâ€™s house.Â  On September 6, 1995, Dave Demeris, from the Soil Conservation Service of the Federal Department of Agriculture, surveyed McConnellâ€™s property.Â  Demeris flagged the level of the emergency spillway (718 feet) and the level of the easement (724 feet).Â  The level of the emergency spillway takes in the entire first floor of McConnellâ€™s house.Â  McConnell cannot currently obtain a building permit to repair his home because of its location within the flood plain.Â  \r\nIn his complaint filed December 8, 1995, McConnell asserted claims against Burry, Rabon Creek, and other defendants alleging various causes of action arising out of the damage to his property and inability to rebuild. Â McConnell alleged Burryâ€™s failure to disclose the existence of a flood plain on the subject property gives rise to claims against Burry for fraud, constructive fraud, negligent misrepresentation, negligent/reckless nondisclosure of land defects, fraudulent concealment, breach of fiduciary duty, violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act (SCUTPA), negligence, breach of warranty of merchantability, breach of warranty of fitness, breach of express warranty, and breach of contract.Â  McConnell also sought an injunction requiring Burry to protect against the damages resulting from the Rabon Creek easement. Â McConnellâ€™s lawsuit was consolidated with similar individual actions by his neighbors.Â  \r\nIn 1997, the trial court granted partial summary judgment as to the existence of the easement as initially executed and filed.Â  After a bench trial, the court found in favor of McConnell and his neighbors.Â  On appeal, this court held that the easement was clear and unambiguous, allowing Rabon Creek to flood the land surrounding the lake up to the top of the dam (an elevation of 724.5 feet), and the Homeowners possessed actual or constructive notice of the easement. Â Binkley v. Rabon Creek Watershed Conserv. Dist. of Fountain Inn, 348 S.C. 58, 558 S.E.2d 902 (Ct. App. 2001), cert. denied (Oct. 23, 2002).Â  \r\nOn remand, the trial court granted summary judgment to Burry on all of McConnellâ€™s causes of action on the merits and found McConnellâ€™s claims were barred by the statute of limitations.Â  The court subsequently denied McConnellâ€™s motion to alter or amend the judgment.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nTo obtain summary judgment, the moving party must demonstrate there is â€œno genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€ Â Wilson v. Moseley, 327 S.C. 144, 146, 488 S.E.2d 862, 863 (1997).Â  In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the court must view the evidence and the inferences that can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id. Â â€œSummary judgment should not be granted even when there is no dispute as to the evidentiary facts, if there is a dispute as to the conclusions to be drawn therefrom.â€Â  Laurens Emergency Med. Specialists, P.A. v. M.S. Bailey &amp; Sons Bankers, 355 S.C. 104, 108-09, 584 S.E.2d 375, 377 (2003). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Fraud, Constructive Fraud, Negligent Misrepresentation, and Negligence \r\nMcConnell argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on his causes of action for fraud, constructive fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and negligence.Â  We agree. \r\nTo prove an action for fraud, the plaintiff must establish the following elements:\r\n\r\n1) a representation; 2) its falsity; 3) its materiality; 4) knowledge of its falsity or a reckless disregard of its truth or falsity; 5) intent that the representation be acted upon; 6) the hearerâ€™s ignorance of its falsity; 7) the hearerâ€™s reliance on its truth; 8) the hearerâ€™s right to rely thereon; and 9) the hearerâ€™s consequent and proximate injury.Â  Failure to prove any one of these elements is fatal.\r\n\r\nFlorentine Corp. v. PEDA I, Inc., 287 S.C. 382, 385-86, 339 S.E.2d 112, 113-14 (1985)(citations omitted).Â  \r\nTo establish constructive fraud, the plaintiff must establish all of the elements of actual fraud except the element of intent.Â  Ardis v. Cox, 314 S.C. 512, 516, 431 S.E.2d 267, 269 (Ct. App. 1993). \r\nThe plaintiff must establish the following elements to establish liability for negligent misrepresentation: \r\n\r\n1) the defendant made a false representation to the plaintiff; 2) the defendant had a pecuniary interest in making the representation; 3) the defendant owed a duty of care to see that he communicated truthful information to the plaintiff; 4) the defendant breached that duty by failing to exercise due care; 5) the plaintiff justifiably relied on the representation; and 6) the plaintiff suffered a pecuniary loss as the proximate result of his reliance upon the representation.\r\n\r\nSauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of South Carolina, 354 S.C. 397, 407, 581 S.E.2d 161, 166 (2003).\r\nFinally, for a negligence claim, the plaintiff must establish: 1) a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff; 2) a breach of that duty by a negligent act or omission; and 3) damage proximately resulting from the breach of duty.Â  Rickborn v. Liberty Life Ins. Co., 321 S.C. 291, 300, 468 S.E.2d 292, 298 (1996).Â  \r\nA non-disclosure becomes fraudulent concealment when it is the duty of the party having knowledge of the facts to make them known to the other party to the transaction.Â  Lawson v. Citizens &amp; S. Natâ€™lÂ  Bank of S.C., 259 S.C. 477, 481-82, 193 S.E.2d 124, 126 (1972).Â  The seller of real property has a duty to disclose material facts to the purchaser â€œ[w]here material facts are accessible to the [seller] only and he knows them not to be within the reach of the diligent attention, observation and judgment of the purchaser.â€Â  Lawson, 259 S.C. at 485, 193 S.E.2d at 128.Â Â Â  \r\nThe right to rely must be determined in light of the plaintiffâ€™s duty to use reasonable prudence and diligence under the circumstances in identifying the truth with respect to the representations made to him.Â  Florentine Corp., 287 S.C. at 386, 339 S.E.2d at 114.Â  One who has knowledge of the truth or the means by which he could acquire such knowledge with reasonable diligence cannot claim to have been misled.Â  Binkley v. Rabon Creek Watershed Conserv. Dist. of Fountain Inn, 348 S.C. 58, 71, 558 S.E.2d 902, 908 (Ct. App. 2001), cert. denied (Oct. 23, 2002).Â  The determination of what constitutes reasonable diligence and prudence must be made on a case by case basis.Â \r\nSlack v. James, 364 S.C. 609, 615, 614 S.E.2d 636, 639 (2005).Â  As a general rule, questions concerning reliance and its reasonableness are factual questions for the jury.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThis court recently affirmed the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment on similar claims by McConnellâ€™s neighbors, John and Janice LoPresti against Burry.Â  LoPresti v. Burry, 364 S.C. 271, 612 S.E.2d 730 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  The trial court dismissed the Loprestisâ€™ claims based on a finding that they were charged with constructive notice of the flood easement.Â  This court found nothing in the record to support the Loprestisâ€™ argument that they justifiably relied on the absence in the plat of the dotted lines showing the flood plain.Â  We found no evidence suggesting the altered plat induced the LoPrestis not to make a complete review of the public records or request a detailed survey of the property before purchasing.Â  We considered the LoPrestisâ€™ argument that the trial court erred in finding Burry was not required to disclose the flood easement and other arguments and concluded, â€œThe fact that the LoPrestis had constructive notice of the easement and the absence of any special relationship between the LoPrestis and . . . Burry . . . that would require disclosure of a matter of public record are dispositive of these arguments.â€Â  LoPresti, 364 S.C. at 278, 612 S.E.2d at 733-34.Â Â Â Â  \r\nIt is undisputed McConnell, like the LoPrestis, had constructive notice of the flood easement.Â  See Binkley, 348 S.C. at 68, 558 S.E.2d at 907 (ruling McConnell and neighbors had actual or constructive notice of the flood easement).Â  However, on appeal McConnellâ€™s claims against Burry are not based on concealment of the easement, but rather concealment of the flood plain line and McConnellâ€™s inability to rebuild his home.Â  This flood plain line constitutes a separate and distinct legal barrier to McConnellâ€™s ability to rebuild.[1]Â  Pat Webb with the Greenville County Building Authority testified that in order for McConnell to receive a building permit, the living area, all live mechanical systems including ductwork, and all live electrical systems in the house would have to be two feet above the hundred-year flood line. \r\nBurry had a legal duty to disclose the location of the hundred year flood line.Â  Webb testified the countyâ€™s Floodplain Management Regulations require developers to calculate base flood elevation data and provide that information to the county.Â  She explained that if Burry had received information from his surveyor that the property that was being subdivided was in a special flood hazard area, Burry would have been required to submit base flood elevation data to the county. \r\nA false representation made to the public in general may form the basis for liability for an individual.Â  37 Am.Jur.2d Fraud and Deceit Â§ 111 (2001).Â  â€œ[O]ne who intends to defraud the public or a particular class of persons is deemed to have intended to defraud every individual in that class who is actually misled.â€Â  Id.Â  This principle applies where a party has sustained damages as a result of relying upon false information contained in a report required by statute to be filed with a public official.Â  37 Am.Jur.2d Fraud and Deceit Â§ 112 (2001).Â  Furthermore, the person furnishing false information in the report is liable to one injured by reliance on the report if the maker of the report is requested to give information and refers the inquirer to the report for that information.Â  Id.Â  Thus, Burryâ€™s nondisclosure of the flood line to the county may be actionable by McConnell.Â  \r\nAs Burry had a duty to disclose the existence of the flood line on McConnellâ€™s property, this case hinges on whether McConnell had a right to rely on any representation made by Burry.Â  We find there is conflicting evidence on whether through the use of reasonable diligence McConnell could have discovered the flood line.Â  The record includes evidence of several warning signs that a jury could consider to have put McConnell on notice to make further investigations.Â  Not only was McConnellâ€™s property next to a lake, but also, a duly recorded, unambiguous flood easement encumbered McConnellâ€™s property.Â  In addition, a real estate appraisal obtained April 22, 1994, informed McConnell the appraisers were â€œunable to determine exact location of [property] on attached flood mapâ€ but â€œbelieved . . . that at least the rear portion of the lot is in a flood zone due to the adjacent lake.â€Â  \r\nHowever, McConnell received assurances his house was not in the flood plain.Â  In May 1994, McConnell rolled a construction loan into a mortgage and was given a â€œNotice to Borrower of Special Flood Hazard Areaâ€ by NationsBank.Â  The bank informed McConnell the flood hazard insurance requirement would be waived if a survey indicated no flood hazard existed and/or insurance covered any flood hazard.Â  McConnell hired surveyor John Montgomery to perform a survey in December 1994.Â  Montgomeryâ€™s survey indicated improvements on the property were not in a flood plain.[2]Â  McConnell also attempted to obtain flood insurance from State Farm Insurance.Â  The State Farm agent told McConnell that his house was not in a flood plain.Â  When McConnell informed the bank of the survey and insurance information, the bank waived the special flood hazard insurance requirement.Â  \r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to McConnell, we hold a jury could reasonably conclude McConnell was justified in relying on Burryâ€™s failure to disclose the existence of the flood plain line, either on the plat or by filing the information with the County.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the claims of fraud, constructive fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and negligence.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Negligent/Reckless Nondisclosure of Land Defect \r\nMcConnell argues the trial court erred in finding that his negligent representation claim for land defects should be dismissed because of a failure to show that McConnell showed â€œbodily harm,â€ the error being that there is no bodily harm requirement.Â  He asserts, â€œSouth Carolina recognizes the tort of negligent representation and the only requirement for damages is that the plaintiff suffers pecuniary loss.â€Â  It appears from his brief that McConnell is only seeking damages for negligent misrepresentation and is not asserting a separate tort ofÂ  negligent/reckless nondisclosure of land defects.Â  A showing of physical harm is not a requirement of a claim for negligent misrepresentation.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act\r\nMcConnell asserts Burryâ€™s alleged misrepresentations violate the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act (SCUTPA).Â  We disagree.\r\nInÂ  Reynolds v. Ryland Group, Inc., 340 S.C. 331, 335, 531 S.E.2d 917, 919 (2000), the supreme court considered the certified question:Â  â€œUnder South Carolina law, can Plaintiffs in a residential construction defects case sue Defendant builder, seller and developer under the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act if Plaintiffs did not purchase their residences from Defendant but from the original homeowner more than three years after the initial sale?â€Â  Id. at 333, 531 S.E.2d at 918.Â  The court ruled:\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no specific provision within SCUPTA which limits a cause of action to an immediate purchaser, we answer the certified question in the negative.Â  We realize that suing under SCUPTA can be a very attractive remedy because the statute provides that if the deceptive act is willful, then the plaintiff may recover treble damages.Â  However, subsequent purchasers are not without remedies.Â  The courts and legislature have paved the way to allow subsequent purchasers to bring causes of actions in tort, negligence and implied warranties.\r\n\r\nId. at 335, 531 S.E.2d at 919-20.Â  \r\nAs the supreme court has ruled that a subsequent purchaser may not sue the developer under the SCUTPA, we must agree with the trial court that McConnellâ€™s claim under the SCUTPA fails as a matter of law.Â  \r\nIV.&nbsp; Statute of Limitations \r\nMcConnell argues the trial court erred in finding his claims were barred by the statute of limitations.Â  We agree. \r\nMcConnellâ€™s claims are governed by the three-year statute of limitations.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(5) (2005).Â  Under the discovery rule, the statute of limitations begins to run from the date the injured party either knows or should know, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, that a cause of action exists for the wrongful conduct.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-535 (2005);Â  Dean v. Ruscon Corp., 321 S.C. 360, 363, 468 S.E.2d 645, 647 (1996).\r\n\r\nThe exercise of reasonable diligence means simply that an injured party must act with some promptness where the facts and circumstances of an injury would put a person of common knowledge and experience on notice that some right of his has been invaded or that some claim against another party might exist.Â  The statute of limitations begins to run from this point and not when advice of counsel is sought or a full-blown theory of recovery developed.Â  \r\n\r\nMoriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 341 S.C. 320, 328-29, 534 S.E.2d 672, 676 (2000) (citations omitted).\r\nThe statute of limitations is triggered not just by knowledge of an injury but by knowledge of facts, diligently acquired, sufficient to put an injured person on notice of the existence of a cause of action against another.Â  Id. at 329, 534 S.E.2d at 676.Â  The determination of when the statute of limitations began to run is a question of fact for the jury when the parties present conflicting evidence.Â  Id.Â Â Â  \r\nAs we held above, the record contains conflicting evidence of whether McConnell could have and should have discovered the existence of the flood plain line with due diligence.Â  A jury could reasonably determine the statute of limitations did not begin to run until McConnell discovered Burryâ€™s concealment of the flood plain line.Â  Thus, we find the trial court erred in determining the McConnellâ€™s claims are barred by the statute of limitations.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Burry on McConnellâ€™s claims for fraud, constructive fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and negligence.Â  We hold the court correctly held McConnellâ€™s claim under the SCUTPA fails as a matter of law.Â  Accordingly, the order of the trial court is \r\n AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\n HEARN, C.J.,Â  and HUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] McConnell settled with Rabon Creek by entering into an inconsistent use agreement.Â  Thus, the only bar to construction now is the flood line.Â  \r\n[2] However, every survey, including McConnellâ€™s survey by Montgomery, noted the level of the emergency spillway was 718, which is where Walker and Demeris placed the flood plain line.Â  This level covers McConnellâ€™s structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-321","title":"SCDSS v.
