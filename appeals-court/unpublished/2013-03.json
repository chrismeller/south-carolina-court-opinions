We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following\r\nauthorities:\r\n\n(1) As to negligence: Thomasko v. Poole, 349 S.C. 7, 11, 561 S.E.2d 597, 599\r\n(2002) (\"A plaintiff, to establish a cause of action for negligence, must prove the\r\nfollowing four elements: (1) a duty of care owed by defendant to plaintiff[,] (2)\r\nbreach of that duty by a negligent act or omission[,] (3) resulting in damages to the\r\nplaintiff[,] and (4) damages proximately resulted from the breach of duty.\").\r\n\r\n(2) As to civil conspiracy: Vaught v.

Spence,\r\n368 S.C. 106, 130-31, 628 S.E.2d 869, 882 (2006) (\"[W]hen a complaint is\r\ndismissed with prejudice and the plaintiff erroneously is denied the opportunity to\r\nfile and serve an amended complaint, but the plaintiff fails to present additional\r\nfactual allegations or a different theory of recovery which may give rise to a claim\r\nupon which relief may be granted, the appellate court may in its discretion affirm\r\nthe dismissal of the complaint with prejudice.\"); Baughman v.

In February 2007,\r\nNetmoco entered into a contract with the South Carolina Department of\r\nTransportation (SCDOT) to perform vegetation management within Chester\r\nCounty, South Carolina. Netmoco procured a performance bond, as required by\r\nstate law to protect SCDOT against defects or failures of Netmoco's performance,\r\nfrom surety Appellant Allegheny Casualty Company (Allegheny).\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with Allegheny issuing the aforementioned bond, Netmoco, as well\r\nas Nora and Howard Lewis, executed a General Indemnity Agreement (GIA). The\r\nGIA required Netmoco and the Lewises to indemnify Allegheny for certain\r\nliabilities, losses, costs, damages, attorney's fees, and other expenses that\r\nAllegheny may sustain or incur in connection with the Bond.\r\n\r\nPrior to Netmoco completing performance of the Chester County contract, a\r\ndispute arose between Netmoco and SCDOT, with SCDOT making a bond claim\r\nfor $75,127.04 to Allegheny. SCDOT alleged Netmoco defaulted due to non-\r\nperformance, thus necessitating SCDOT's proper termination of the contract and\r\nhiring another entity to complete the project. \"Netmoco explained to Allegheny\r\nthat it vehemently disagreed with SCDOT's allegations and instead insisted that\r\nSCDOT had breached the contract.\" Specifically, Netmoco alleged SCDOT\r\nshorted payments and demanded performance beyond contractual terms.\r\n\r\nAfter SCDOT filed the bond claim, Allegheny sent Netmoco two letters. The first\r\nincluded SCDOT's claim and requested related information, while the second\r\ndemanded $85,000 collateral security, pending the matter's resolution.\r\n\r\nWhen both Netmoco and SCDOT refused to compromise their respective\r\npositions, Allegheny sought, in federal court, a declaration of \"the rights,\r\nobligations, and breaches, if any, of the parties under the [vegetation management\r\ncontract] and the [Bond].\" Allegheny's complaint asserted a declaratory judgment\r\nwould \"clarify and settle all legal relations in issue between the parties.\"\r\nAllegheny's suit named Netmoco, the Lewises, and SCDOT as parties.\r\n\r\nPrior to any declaratory ruling, all parties entered into a Settlement Agreement\r\nwith no admissions of any liability by any of the involved parties. Within the\r\nSettlement Agreement, the parties agreed as follows:\r\n\r\n             1. The parties [will release] any and all claims . . .\r\n             arising out of any damages sustained by the parties\r\n\n             resulting directly or indirectly from [the] Vegetation\r\n             Management contract . . . and Performance Bond . . . ,\r\n             except as hereinafter set forth . . . . Any claims which\r\n             Allegheny may have . . . under the [GIA] . . . are excluded\r\n             from this Settlement Agreement . . .\r\n\r\n             3. Each party will separately pay their own attorneys and\r\n             the costs incurred in this matter.\r\n\r\n             4. PLAINTIFF AND DEFENDANTS\r\n             ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE ABOVE REPRESENTS\r\n             THE TERMS OF THEIR AGREEMENT AND IS A\r\n             FULL AND COMPLETE SETTLEMENT OF THE\r\n             CASE.\r\n\r\n(italicized emphases added).\r\n\r\nAlthough this agreement settled the declaratory judgment action (dispute over\r\nalleged breaches of the vegetation management contract), Allegheny, Netmoco,\r\nand the Lewises now dispute whether the settlement's written terms resolved only\r\nthe vegetation management contract dispute, or, whether in addition to resolving\r\nany issues of such contractual liability, the settlement also resolved any claims\r\narising out of the alleged breaches, such as claims for indemnification for\r\nattorney's fees and costs separately provided for within the GIA.1 Thus, it is the\r\ninterplay, if any, between Paragraphs One and Three presently at issue.\r\n\r\nAllegheny, in the belief that Paragraph One specifically excluded from settlement\r\nall GIA claims, filed suit in state court seeking indemnification of attorney's fees\r\nand costs related to enforcing the GIA. In Allegheny's view, Paragraph Three\r\n\"applies only to claims not covered by the GIA.\" In contrast, Netmoco believes\r\nParagraphs One and Three, collectively, fully resolved the apportionment of\r\nattorney's fees and costs arising from either the underlying GIA or the related\r\ndeclaratory suit instituted to determine obligations under the performance bond.\r\n\r\n1 The GIA provided Allegheny with a right to indemnification for any and all\r\nliability, loss, costs, damages, attorney's fees and other expenses which Allegheny\r\nsustains or incurs in enforcing the GIA's terms, in procuring or attempting to\r\nprocure Allegheny's release from liability, or in recovering or attempting to recover\r\nlosses or expenses incurred. The agreement also permitted the bringing of separate\r\nsuits and that such suits shall not prejudice other suits upon other causes of action.\r\n\nAfter Netmoco responded to Allegheny's complaint seeking indemnification\r\npursuant to the GIA, Netmoco moved for summary judgment. Netmoco argued\r\nthat under the Settlement Agreement's terms, Allegheny already released Netmoco\r\nfrom any such claims. Allegheny also filed a motion for summary judgment based\r\nupon its opposing contractual interpretation. In determining the motions' merits,\r\nthe state trial court reasoned that the general language of Paragraph One, reserving\r\nthe parties' rights under the surety agreement, was subsequently constrained by the\r\nmore specific language of Paragraph Three requiring the parties \"separately pay\r\ntheir own attorney's fees and costs.\" In view of its interpretation, the court found\r\n\"no genuine issue of fact existed,\" granted Netmoco's related motion, and,\r\neffectively, thwarted Allegheny's ability to seek indemnification under the GIA.\r\n\r\nWhile the trial court's interpretation was sensible, we hold the Settlement\r\nAgreement was also susceptible of another reasonable interpretation; thus, a\r\ngenuine issue of material fact existed and summary judgment was improper.\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate only when no genuine issue of material fact\r\nexists and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c),\r\nSCRCP; see Helms Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 340, 611 S.E.2d\r\n485, 488 (2005). In determining whether triable issues of fact exist, a court views\r\nevidence and all inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\r\nWillis v. Wu, 362 S.C. 146, 151, 607 S.E.2d 63, 65 (2004). Consequently,\r\nsummary judgment is proper when plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist on\r\nwhich reasonable minds cannot differ, Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 518, 595\r\nS.E.2d 817, 822 (Ct. App. 2004), but not when further fact inquiry is desirable to\r\nclarify the law's application. Tupper v. Dorchester Cnty., 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487\r\nS.E.2d 187, 191 (1997).\r\n\r\nWhen applying these principles to a dispute over a contract's construction,\r\ncontractual ambiguity is the crux of the matter; whether contractual ambiguity\r\nexists is a question of law for the court, while actual construction of an ambiguous\r\ncontract is a question for the trier of fact. Soil Remediation Co. v. Nu–Way Envtl.,\r\nInc., 325 S.C. 231, 234, 482 S.E.2d 554, 555 (1997). Owing to this delineation of\r\nroles, summary judgment is improper when an ambiguous contract is at issue\r\nbecause the court cannot clearly ascertain the parties' intent from the instrument's\r\nfour corners. Pee Dee Stores, Inc. v. Doyle, 381 S.C. 234, 241, 672 S.E.2d 799,\r\n802 (Ct. App. 2008); see Soil Remediation, 325 S.C. at 234, 482 S.E.2d at 555-56\r\n(holding an ambiguous contract's construction must be submitted to the jury).\r\nLikewise, because South Carolina law views settlement agreements as contracts,\r\n\nthese same principles determine whether summary judgment, based upon a\r\nparticular interpretation of a settlement agreement, is proper. Pee Dee, 381 S.C. at\r\n241-42, 672 S.E.2d at 803. Accordingly, a court cannot grant summary judgment\r\nfor a particular interpretation of an ambiguous settlement agreement. Id.\r\n\r\nA settlement agreement is ambiguous when its terms are reasonably susceptible of\r\nmore than one interpretation. Id. at 242, 672 S.E.2d at 802. Such variations in\r\ncontractual meaning can arise due to differing interpretations of the instrument's\r\nactual words or when applying the otherwise clear terms to the objects they\r\ndescribe. Hann v. Carolina Cas. Ins. Co., 252 S.C. 518, 524, 167 S.E.2d 420, 422\r\n(1969). Courts cannot, however, base ambiguity upon an isolated clause; courts\r\nmust consider the entire document. Pee Dee, 381 S.C. at 242, 672 S.E.2d at 803.\r\n\r\nAfter considering the Settlement Agreement in its entirety, ambiguity exists both\r\nwithin the instrument's words and in their application to the objects they describe.\r\nMoreover, the ambiguity results from the interplay between two key provisions,\r\nboth of which utilize rather loose language, and, as a result, call the entire\r\ncontract's meaning into question. In fact, the Settlement Agreement is capable of\r\ntwo reasonable, yet diametrically opposed interpretations, each of which forms the\r\nbasis of either Appellant's or Respondent's argument before this court.\r\n\r\nIt is entirely sensible to interpret, as did the trial court, the general and broad\r\nreservation of all GIA rights within Paragraph One as yielding to Paragraph\r\nThree's more specific language extinguishing a single GIA right, i.e., Allegheny's\r\nright to indemnification. Even so, the Settlement Agreement is reasonably\r\nsusceptible of another interpretation.\r\n\r\nParagraph One states \"[t]he parties [will release] any and all claims . . . , except as\r\nhereinafter set forth . . . . Any claims which Allegheny may have . . . under the\r\n[GIA] . . . are excluded from this Settlement Agreement . . . .\" In view of this\r\nlanguage, the Settlement Agreement is also susceptible of the interpretation that\r\nAllegheny's GIA-based indemnification claims remain viable because the\r\nparagraph's terms specifically and entirely excluded from settlement any GIA\r\nclaims. Therefore, to the extent that Paragraph One wholly excluded GIA-based\r\nclaims from the settlement's scope, Paragraph Three was then completely\r\ninapplicable to such claims and, thus, had no impact on Allegheny's ability to later\r\nseek indemnification for attorney's fees and costs pursuant to the GIA.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this interpretation neither renders Paragraph Three superfluous or a\r\ncontractual term meaningless. See Auto Owners Ins. Co. v. Newman, 385 S.C. 187,\r\n\n195 684 S.E.2d 541, 545 (2009) (stating contractual construction should give effect\r\nto the whole instrument and its various provisions). Under this interpretation,\r\nParagraph Three still addressed attorney's fees and costs related to the declaratory\r\naction, i.e., \"this matter.\" Therefore, this interpretation gives meaning to all\r\nprovisions, is internally consistent, and complies with rules of construction. Thus,\r\nit too, is reasonable.\r\n\r\nIn sum, the Settlement Agreement is reasonably susceptible of two different\r\ninterpretations and, therefore, ambiguous. Pee Dee, 381 S.C. at 242, 672 S.E.2d at\r\n802. Because the Settlement Agreement does not clearly express the parties'\r\nintent, its ultimate construction is not a matter for a court. See Soil Remediation,\r\n325 S.C. at 234, 482 S.E.2d at 555-56 (holding a court can construe an\r\nunambiguous contract, while the trier of fact must determine the meaning of an\r\nambiguous one). Accordingly, the grant of summary judgment improperly\r\nprecluded the jury from determining which of the two reasonable interpretations\r\nactually represented the parties' intent. See id. (holding the question of what the\r\nparties intended is one of fact for the jury).\r\n\r\n                                  CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the decision of the circuit court is\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, THOMAS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-098","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Senior Assistant Deputy\r\n        Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant\r\n        Attorney General Julie Kate Keeney, all of Columbia;\r\n        and Solicitor W. Walter Wilkins, III, of Greenville, for\r\n        Respondent.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: Randy Blythe, Jr., was convicted of and sentenced for\r\ndistribution of a cocaine base and distribution of a cocaine base within a half-mile\r\nof a school or public park. He appeals, arguing the trial court erred in admitting a\r\nstatement he gave while in custody but prior to the reading of his Miranda1 rights.\r\nWe disagree.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of the United States has held:\r\n\r\n               [T]he Miranda safeguards come into play whenever a\r\n               person in custody is subjected to either express\r\n               questioning or its functional equivalent. That is to say,\r\n               the term \"interrogation\" under Miranda refers not only to\r\n               express questioning, but also to any words or actions on\r\n               the part of the police (other than those normally attendant\r\n               to arrest and custody) that the police should know are\r\n               reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from\r\n               the suspect. The latter portion of this definition focuses\r\n               primarily upon the perceptions of the suspect, rather than\r\n               the intent of the police. This focus reflects the fact that\r\n               the Miranda safeguards were designed to vest a suspect\r\n               in custody with an added measure of protection against\r\n               coercive police practices, without regard to objective\r\n               proof of the underlying intent of the police. A practice\r\n               that the police should know is reasonably likely to evoke\r\n               an incriminating response from a suspect thus amounts to\r\n               interrogation. But, since the police surely cannot be held\r\n               accountable for the unforeseeable results of their words\r\n               or actions, the definition of interrogation can extend only\r\n               to words or actions on the part of police officers that they\r\n               should have known were reasonably likely to elicit an\r\n               incriminating response.\r\n\r\nRhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 300-02, 100 S. Ct. 1682, 1689-90 (1980)\r\n(emphasis in original; footnotes omitted); accord State v. Sims, 304 S.C. 409, 416-\r\n17, 405 S.E.2d 377, 381-82 (1991); State v. Franklin, 299 S.C. 133, 135-36, 382\r\nS.E.2d 911, 912-13 (1989); State v. Brown, 389 S.C. 84, 92, 697 S.E.2d 622, 627\r\n(Ct. App. 2010).\r\n\r\n    Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (1966).\r\n1\r\n\nBlythe claims his statement was involuntary because it was obtained during a\r\ncustodial interrogation that occurred before the police provided him with Miranda\r\nwarnings. The dispositive issue involved in this appeal, therefore, is whether\r\nBlythe was subjected to a custodial interrogation at the time he made the\r\nincriminating statement. If he was not, his Fifth Amendment rights and his right to\r\nreceive Miranda warning were not implicated. United States v. Kimbrough, 477\r\nF.3d 144, 147 (4th Cir. 2007).\r\n\r\nWe affirm the admission of Blythe's statement, because the trial court properly\r\nfound the preponderance of the evidence indicated no interrogation occurred and\r\nBlythe gave the statement voluntarily. First, Blythe presented the only evidence of\r\nexpress questioning, and the State successfully rebutted his testimony. At the time\r\nof the statement, Blythe was in custody for an unrelated charge and had not been\r\nadvised of his Miranda rights. Although he testified in some detail concerning his\r\ninterrogation by either four or five officers who \"pull[ed] him out of [his] cell\" and\r\nasked him numerous questions about his drug connections, other testimony called\r\ninto question key aspects of his account. Blythe identified three of his\r\ninterrogators. However, one testified he was out of the office on medical leave at\r\nthe time of Blythe's statement, and another denied questioning Blythe about\r\nanything between the early 1990s and 2009. Lieutenant Lovell described meeting\r\nBlythe in the booking area after Officer Mills relayed Blythe's request that they\r\nmeet. Lieutenant Lovell testified only he and Officer Mills had accompanied\r\nBlythe into the interview room, but they never asked him a question. They had\r\nescorted him from the public booking area into a private interview room,2 asked no\r\nquestions, and simply allowed him to talk. Finally, Lieutenant Lovell explained he\r\nwas not interested in talking with Blythe because the police \"had a good case on\r\nhim.\" During trial, Officer Mills testified consistently with Lieutenant Lovell's\r\naccount. In view of the inconsistencies in Blythe's testimony, on the one hand, and\r\nthe consistent testimony of the police officers, on the other, the trial court did not\r\nerr in finding a preponderance of the evidence indicated Blythe gave his statement\r\nvoluntarily and not in response to an interrogation.\r\n\r\nSecond, the evidence does not support Blythe's contention he was subjected to the\r\n\"functional equivalent\" of an interrogation. A court analyzing whether police\r\n\r\n2 Lieutenant Lovell recalled matching the serial numbers of the bills provided to\r\nthe confidential informant to buy the drugs to the serial numbers of bills recovered\r\nfrom Blythe's car in front of Blythe before they entered the interview room.\r\n\nbehavior constituted the functional equivalent of an interrogation \"focuses\r\nprimarily upon the perceptions of the suspect, rather than the intent of the police.\"\r\nInnis, 446 U.S. at 301, 100 S. Ct. at 1690. Blythe argues Lieutenant Lovell\r\nmatched the serial numbers on the recovered money in front of him in an effort to\r\npressure him into confessing. He also complains Lieutenant Lovell's testimony\r\nthat he \"really wasn't interested\" in talking with Blythe but \"would listen to what\r\n[Blythe] had to say\" amounted to using reverse psychology to elicit an\r\nincriminating response. However, Blythe's pretrial testimony failed to establish\r\nany awareness of such subtleties. At the hearing, Blythe flatly denied seeing the\r\nmoney after his arrest. Moreover, he described a wholly different interrogation\r\nscenario in which four or five police officers \"pulled [him] out of [his] cell\" and\r\nquestioned him about drug dealers and users. The evidence presented supported\r\nthe trial court's finding Blythe's statement did not result from any behavior by\r\nLieutenant Lovell. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in admitting Blythe's\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., GEATHERS, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-099","title":"State v.

In its order dismissing the Justinis' prior\r\naction, Justini v. Berkeley Hall, LLC, et al., 2009-CP-07-01092, the trial court held\r\nthat the three-year statute of limitations applied to and barred the Justinis' claims.\r\nThe Justinis failed to perfect their appeal of the trial court's orders in that action.\r\n\"Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, also known as issue preclusion, when an\r\nissue has been actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, the\r\ndetermination is conclusive in a subsequent action whether on the same or a\r\ndifferent claim.\" Zurcher v. Bilton, 379 S.C. 132, 135, 666 S.E.2d 224, 226\r\n(2008). Summary judgment is an adjudication on the merits. Nelson v. QHG of\r\nS.C., Inc., 362 S.C. 421, 425, 608 S.E.2d 855, 858 (2005). In Nelson, the supreme\r\ncourt held the plaintiff's claims against the defendants were collaterally estopped\r\nbecause there was a fair and full opportunity to litigate those claims in an earlier\r\nsuit in which summary judgment had been granted. Id. As the claims in the\r\npresent action are identical to those the trial court found to be time-barred in the\r\nprior action, we find no error in the trial court's ruling that the statute of limitations\r\nbarred this action.\r\n\r\nAs we affirm the trial court's order for the above stated ground, we need not reach\r\nthe Justinis' remaining issues.

(EBT)\r\nappeals from a judgment against it, arguing the master erred in: (1) finding its\r\nmotion to reconsider was not timely filed; (2) denying its motion for continuance;\r\n(3) ruling its president, Howard McKenzie, had the authority to bind it to the loan\r\nat issue; and (4) not finding Anderson Brothers Bank (the Bank) was grossly\r\nnegligent, entitling it to be equitably protected from a deficiency judgment. We\r\naffirm.1\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nMcKenzie and his son owned and operated several funeral homes in Georgetown\r\nand the surrounding counties. EBT is a South Carolina Corporation owned by\r\nMcKenzie, his wife, and his son, and it holds title to some of the funeral homes.\r\nOn January 4, 2007, EBT purchased a building on Front Street in Georgetown, and\r\nthe Bank loaned EBT $323,964, guaranteed by a note signed by McKenzie.\r\nMcKenzie personally guaranteed the note, and it was secured by a mortgage from\r\nEBT to the Bank, also signed by McKenzie. On August 27, 2007, McKenzie\r\nentered into a contract to sell the building for $399,000; however, the sale never\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nEventually, EBT stopped making payments under the note; therefore, the Bank\r\ncommenced an action for foreclosure on the property in March 2009. The Bank\r\nalso sought a deficiency judgment against McKenzie based on the note he signed\r\nin favor of the Bank. EBT and McKenzie answered, admitting the execution of the\r\nnote and mortgage by EBT and the guaranty by McKenzie; however, they alleged\r\nthe note, mortgage, and guaranty were unenforceable.2 By way of counterclaim,\r\nand without specific factual allegations, they raised the defenses of unclean hands,\r\nfraud and misrepresentation, illegal documents, violations of public policy, and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n2 McKenzie passed away on June 13, 2009, and his wife, Bonnie McKenzie, as\r\nPersonal Representative of his Estate and Trustee of the Howard McKenzie Family\r\nTrust, was substituted as a party to this action.\r\n\ndoctrine of in pari delicto.3 They also asserted the mortgage was void ab initio\r\nbecause it was obtained by duress or fraud as a result of McKenzie's lack of mental\r\ncapacity to enter into contract or sign any legal document at the time of its\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nThe matter was referred to a master by consent of all parties, and the day before the\r\nscheduled trial, EBT filed a motion for continuance, which the master denied. A\r\nnon-jury trial was held on March 15, 2011. EBT admitted the Bank was entitled to\r\nforeclose on the loan, but argued the master should not grant a deficiency judgment\r\nagainst EBT. On July 29, 2011, the master filed his final decree granting the Bank\r\njudgment against EBT for $428,115.04 and ordering the collateral sold at a judicial\r\nsale. The master granted the Bank a deficiency judgment. EBT filed a motion to\r\nreconsider on August 16, 2011. The master denied the motion, finding it was\r\nuntimely and lacked merit due to EBT's stipulation to the foreclosure and\r\nacknowledgment of the validity of the note and mortgage. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nA mortgage foreclosure is an action in equity. U.S. Bank Trust Nat'l Ass'n v. Bell,\r\n385 S.C. 364, 373, 684 S.E.2d 199, 204 (Ct. App. 2009). \"In an appeal from an\r\naction in equity, tried by a judge alone, we may find facts in accordance with our\r\nown view of the preponderance of the evidence.\" Id.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Motion for Continuance\r\n\r\nEBT argues the master erred in denying its motion for continuance. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"The grant or denial of a continuance is within the sound discretion of the trial\r\njudge and is reviewable on appeal only when an abuse of discretion appears from\r\nthe record.\" Plyler v. Burns, 373 S.C. 637, 650, 647 S.E.2d 188, 195 (2007). \"An\r\n\r\n3 \"The doctrine of in pari delicto is '[t]he principle that a plaintiff who has\r\nparticipated in wrongdoing may not recover damages resulting from the\r\nwrongdoing.'\" Myatt v. RHBT Fin. Corp., 370 S.C. 391, 395, 635 S.E.2d 545, 547\r\n(Ct. App. 2006) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 794 (7th ed. 1999)). \"In South\r\nCarolina, this doctrine precludes one joint tort-feasor from seeking indemnity from\r\nanother.\" Id.\r\n\nabuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of the circuit court are either\r\ncontrolled by an error of law or are based on unsupported factual conclusions.\"\r\nCarson v. CSX Transp., Inc., 400 S.C. 221, 229, 734 S.E.2d 148, 152 (2012).\r\n\"Moreover, the denial of a motion for a continuance on the ground that counsel has\r\nnot had time to prepare is rarely disturbed on appeal.\" Plyler, 373 S.C. at 650, 647\r\nS.E.2d at 195; see also Trotter v. Trane Coil Facility, 393 S.C. 637, 650, 714\r\nS.E.2d 289, 295 (2011) (\"[D]ecisions denying a request for a continuance are\r\n'rarely' overturned.\").\r\n\r\nEBT filed its motion for continuance the day before trial was scheduled to begin,\r\nasserting: (1) counsel was retained on March 1, 2011, fourteen days prior to trial;\r\n(2) discovery requests sent to EBT's previous attorney on March 2 had not been\r\ncompletely answered; (3) one witness would suffer harm in the practice of her\r\nbusiness if she was required to come to court on March 15; (4) another witness,\r\nMcKenzie's doctor, had not been interviewed; and (5) it required additional time to\r\nreview the materials provided by the Bank. On appeal, EBT makes the same\r\narguments concerning unproduced discovery from EBT's previous attorney and\r\nrequiring additional time to review the materials provided by the Bank. EBT\r\nalleges it is prejudiced by its inability to access EBT's previous attorney's file,\r\ninterview and call a doctor on the issue of McKenzie's competency, and engage an\r\nexpert regarding the Bank's alleged negligence.\r\n\r\nEBT had counsel protecting its interest for almost two years prior to trial, and EBT\r\ndid not explain why it could not have previously obtained the information. See\r\nGrant v. Grant, 288 S.C. 86, 89, 340 S.E.2d 791, 793 (Ct. App. 1986) (finding the\r\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a request for a continuance where\r\nthe new counsel sought a continuance primarily to interview witnesses, and there\r\nwas nothing in the record to explain why the witnesses were not interviewed or\r\ncould not have been interviewed during the six day period following the\r\ncommencement of his employment). Further, at trial while arguing its motion for\r\ncontinuance, EBT stipulated to the Bank's right to foreclose on the loan.\r\nTherefore, we find the master did not abuse his discretion in denying EBT's motion\r\nfor continuance. See Townsend v. Townsend, 323 S.C. 309, 313, 474 S.E.2d 424,\r\n427 (1996) (finding appellate court will not set aside a court's ruling on a motion\r\nfor a continuance unless it clearly appears there was an abuse of discretion to the\r\nprejudice of the movant).\r\n\nII.   Authority to Bind\r\n\r\nEBT argues the master erred in ruling Howard McKenzie had authority to bind\r\nEBT to the loan at issue. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"An agency relationship may be established by evidence of actual or apparent\r\nauthority.\" Charleston, S.C. Registry for Golf & Tourism, Inc. v. Young Clement\r\nRivers & Tisdale, LLP, 359 S.C. 635, 642, 598 S.E.2d 717, 721 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nActual authority is expressly conferred upon the agent by the principal. Id.\r\nApparent authority arises when the principal knowingly permits the agent to\r\nexercise or holds the agent out as possessing authority. Id.\r\n\r\nMcKenzie's son, Tim, testified his father was no longer president after 2005 and\r\nonly had authority to do some things for EBT; however, Tim had nothing to\r\ndocument his father ceased being president and manager of EBT or ceased to have\r\ncomplete authority to transact business for EBT. Even after McKenzie transferred\r\nhis EBT shares to his wife on October 5, 2004, McKenzie's role in EBT did not\r\nchange. EBT's corporate resolution, dated October 5, 2004, states: \"Howard\r\nMcKenzie, remaining as President and manager, be . . . designated . . . to obligate,\r\nsign, enter, into all binding contracts, or agreements, etc. pertaining to EBT\r\nProperty Holding Company, Inc., and hereby [is] elected to the designated office of\r\nPresident of the Corporation.\" Tim acknowledged his father executed a deed as\r\npresident of EBT on August 14, 2006, conveying real estate for $1,000,000, and\r\nthe deed was valid despite the lack of any other officer's or shareholder's signature.\r\nTim also acknowledged McKenzie, as president, executed a mortgage and an\r\nassignment of leases and rents from EBT to Carolina First Bank on April 27, 2006.\r\nFurthermore, Tim admitted he never informed the Bank that McKenzie was no\r\nlonger authorized to handle a loan transaction on behalf of EBT or notified the\r\nBank that McKenzie was mentally incompetent to handle a loan transaction. Tim\r\nalso had no evidence the Bank knew or should have known McKenzie was\r\nmentally incompetent when he applied for the loan. Therefore, McKenzie had\r\nactual authority as president and manager to enter into the loan transaction and\r\nexecute the appropriate loan documents on behalf of EBT. See Hofer v. St. Clair,\r\n298 S.C. 503, 510, 381 S.E.2d 736, 740 (1989) (finding that even though the\r\nevidence on whether the partner had actual authority to bind the partnership to the\r\ncontracts for the sale of partnership land was conflicting, the lower court's findings\r\nwere supported by the record, and the fact finder who heard the testimony is in the\r\nbest position to judge the demeanor and veracity of the witnesses).\r\n\nEven if McKenzie did not have actual authority to act for EBT, his actions were\r\nstill binding if he had apparent authority to act for EBT. Tim testified he knew his\r\nfather was transacting business for EBT and trying to get a loan. However, neither\r\nhe nor his mother attempted to stop McKenzie from securing a loan for EBT;\r\nnotify the bank that McKenzie was no longer authorized to procure a loan for EBT;\r\nor inform any third party McKenzie was unauthorized to act for EBT. Further,\r\nproperty transactions were in the regular course of business for EBT, not the\r\nexception. See Hofer, 298 S.C. at 510, 381 S.E.2d at 740 (\"[E]ven if a partner\r\nlacks the actual authority to bind the partnership, when a partner is apparently\r\ncarrying on the business of the partnership in the usual way, and the one with\r\nwhom he is transacting business does not know the partner lacks actual authority,\r\nthe partner's acts will bind the partnership.\"); Fernander v. Thigpen, 278 S.C. 140,\r\n143, 293 S.E.2d 424, 426 (1982) (\"The doctrine of apparent authority provides that\r\nthe principal is bound by the acts of its agent when it has placed the agent in such a\r\nposition that persons of ordinary prudence, reasonably knowledgeable with\r\nbusiness usages and customs, are led to believe the agent has certain authority and\r\nthey in turn deal with the agent based on that assumption.\"); id. (finding an\r\n\"agency relationship may be established by showing evidence of apparent or\r\nimplied authority, even where the parties have entered an agreement to the\r\ncontrary\"); R & G Constr., Inc. v. Lowcountry Reg'l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424,\r\n432, 540 S.E.2d 113, 118 (Ct. App. 2000) (\"[T]he concept of apparent authority\r\ndepends upon manifestations by the principal to a third party and the reasonable\r\nbelief by the third party that the agent is authorized to bind the principal.\").\r\n\r\nFurther, even if McKenzie lacked actual or apparent corporate authority to enter\r\ninto the loan transaction at issue, EBT's conduct ratified the loan. EBT received\r\nand retained the following benefits of the loan: (1) the prior existing mortgage on\r\nthe property was paid off and the balance of the proceeds were remitted to EBT;\r\n(2) those funds were deposited into EBT's bank account; (3) the shareholders and\r\nofficers of EBT, McKenzie's wife and son, did nothing to repudiate the loan; and\r\n(4) several payments on the loan were made with checks signed by Tim.\r\nTherefore, the parties' conduct ratified the loan, even if it was unauthorized. See\r\nLincoln v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 300 S.C. 188, 191, 386 S.E.2d 801, 803 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1989) (\"Ratification exists upon the concurrence of three elements[:] (1)\r\nacceptance by the principal of the benefits of the agent's acts[;] (2) full knowledge\r\nof the facts[;] and (3) circumstances or an affirmative election indicating an\r\nintention to adopt the unauthorized arrangements.\").\r\n\nBased on our review of the evidence, we find McKenzie had actual and apparent\r\nauthority to act on behalf of EBT and to enter into the loan at issue.\r\n\r\nIII.   Negligence\r\n\r\nEBT argues the master erred in not finding the Bank's gross negligence entitles it\r\nto be equitably protected from a deficiency judgment. We disagree.\r\n\r\nEBT did not assert the Bank was grossly negligent in its answer or counterclaims\r\nor at trial, and the master's order does not mention anything about negligence by\r\nthe Bank. EBT raised this issue for the first time in its motion to reconsider, which\r\nthe master found was untimely. Therefore, we find this issue is not preserved for\r\nour review. See Kiawah Prop. Owners Grp. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n of S.C., 359\r\nS.C. 105, 113, 597 S.E.2d 145, 149 (2004) (finding the issue was not preserved\r\nbecause a party may not raise an issue in a motion to reconsider, alter, or amend a\r\njudgment that could have been presented prior to the judgment); Staubes v. City of\r\nFolly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (\"It is well-settled that\r\nan issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to\r\nand ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.\").\r\n\r\nIV.    Motion to Reconsider\r\n\r\nEBT argues the master erred in finding its motion to reconsider was not timely\r\nfiled. Because our decisions on the prior issues are dispositive of this appeal, we\r\ndecline to address this issue. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc.,\r\n335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need\r\nnot review remaining issues when its determination of another issue is dispositive\r\nof the appeal).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the master's order is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nSHORT, THOMAS, and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-110","title":"State v.

On appeal,\r\nAppellant Field House Properties (Field House) argues it was entitled to a property\r\ntax exemption for its subdivided parking spaces because (1) the legislature drew no\r\ndistinction between real and personal property in section 12-37-220(B)(30) of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code (2000), and (2) federal income tax treatment provides for the\r\nexemption.

(Mother) appeals the family court order terminating\r\nher parental rights to her minor child (Child). Mother argues the family court erred\r\nin finding the statutory grounds for termination of parental rights (TPR) existed\r\nand TPR is in Child's best interest.\r\n\r\nThe family court may order TPR upon finding one or more of eleven statutory\r\ngrounds is satisfied and also finding that TPR is in the best interest of the child.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2570 (2010 & Supp. 2012). The grounds for TPR must be\r\nproven by clear and convincing evidence. S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336\r\nS.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999). On appeal from the family\r\ncourt, this court reviews factual and legal issues de novo. Simmons v. Simmons,\r\n392 S.C. 412, 414, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011). Although this court reviews the\r\nfamily court's findings de novo, we are not required to ignore the fact that the trial\r\ncourt, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their\r\ncredibility. Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 385, 709 S.E.2d 650, 652 (2011). \"[T]he\r\nbest interests of the children are the paramount consideration.\" S.C. Dep't of Soc.\r\nServs. v. Smith, 343 S.C. 129, 133, 538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct. App. 2000). \"The\r\ninterests of the child shall prevail if the child's interest and the parental rights\r\nconflict.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2620 (2010).\r\n\r\nWe find clear and convincing evidence shows Mother failed to remedy the\r\nconditions which caused the removal of Child. See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-\r\n2570(2) (2010). An attempt to remedy alone is inadequate to preserve\r\nparental rights. S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Pritchett, 296 S.C. 517, 520, 374\r\nS.E.2d 500, 501 (Ct. App. 1988). In Hooper v. Rockwell, the supreme court found\r\nthe family court properly terminated a mother's parental rights because the\r\nDepartment of Social Services (DSS) presented the mother with multiple\r\nopportunities to obtain mental health counseling and comply with treatment plans\r\nbut Mother refused to address her personality disorder. 334 S.C. 281, 299-300,\r\n513 S.E.2d 358, 368 (1999). Here, the condition that threatened Child with harm\r\nwas Mother's refusal to address her bipolar disorder to become an emotionally\r\nstable parent for Child. Mother's treatment plan provided that she must complete a\r\npsychological evaluation and follow all recommendations, including seeing a\r\n\nmedical provider and taking mental health medications as prescribed. Dr. Raul\r\nPaez, a psychiatrist who treated Mother for bipolar disorder, testified she refused to\r\ntake medication as he prescribed, and she was difficult to treat because she did not\r\nbelieve she had a mental illness. Testimony from the hearing confirms Mother\r\nsuffers from delusional thoughts and becomes aggressive and angry. Moreover,\r\nMother's bipolar disorder has impaired her ability to meaningfully fulfill the other\r\nrequirements of her treatment plan. Accordingly, we believe Mother has failed to\r\nremedy the conditions which caused the removal of Child. S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-\r\n2570(2).\r\n\r\nWe find clear and convincing evidence shows Mother neglected Child, and \"it is\r\nnot reasonably likely that the home can be made safe within twelve months.\" S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 63-7-2570(1) (2010). The family court may consider the parent's\r\nprevious neglect of the child when determining the likelihood the parent can make\r\nthe home safe within twelve months. Id. Section 63-7-20(4)(a) of the South\r\nCarolina Code (2010) defines \"child abuse or neglect\" as inflicting upon the child\r\n\"physical or mental injury or engages in acts or omissions which present a\r\nsubstantial risk of physical or mental injury to the child . . . .\" We believe it is not\r\nreasonably likely Mother's home can be made safe within twelve months because\r\nshe previously neglected Child and three other children. In 1999, Mother lost\r\ncustody of two children because she could not control her anger around their\r\nfather, filed a false police report against the children's father, and made the children\r\nupset when they were in her custody. In 2004, Mother lost custody of a third child\r\nafter DSS indicated a case against Mother for substantial risk of neglect due to\r\ndrug use. Additionally, Mother has presented a history of neglect with Child. In\r\n2007, Mother lost custody of Child after police responded to a domestic violence\r\ndispute between Mother and her boyfriend. Child remained in foster care and her\r\nmaternal grandmother's care for twenty-five months. During the four month period\r\nMother regained custody of Child, DSS received two reports of Mother acting\r\nunlawfully while Child was in her care. DSS then restricted Mother to supervised\r\nvisits with Child, but shortly thereafter, police arrested Mother for repeatedly\r\nbacking her car into another vehicle while Child was standing in Mother's car.\r\nThus, based on the repetition of Mother's neglect of Child and three other children,\r\nwe believe it is not reasonably likely that her home will be made safe within twelve\r\nmonths. See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2570(1) (providing the court may consider the\r\nparent's previous neglect of the children when determining the likelihood the\r\nparent can make the home safe within twelve months).\r\n\nWe further find clear and convincing evidence shows Mother has a diagnosable\r\ncondition, which is unlikely to change in a reasonable time, and this condition\r\nmakes Mother unlikely to provide minimally acceptable care for the child. S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 63-7-2570(6) (Supp. 2012).           \"When the diagnosable condition\r\nalleged is mental deficiency, there must be clear and convincing evidence that: (1)\r\nthe parent has a diagnosed mental deficiency, and (2) this deficiency makes it\r\nunlikely that the parent will be able to provide minimally acceptable care of the\r\nchild.\" S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Roe, 371 S.C. 450, 456, 639 S.E.2d 165, 168-69\r\n(Ct. App. 2006). This court has found that the testimony of a clinical psychologist\r\ncan provide clear and convincing evidence that a parent has a diagnosable\r\ncondition of mental deficiency, unlikely to change within reasonable time to allow\r\nthe parent to provide minimally acceptable care. S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v.\r\nHumphreys, 297 S.C. 118, 119-21, 374 S.E.2d 922, 924 (Ct. App. 1988). Dr. Paez\r\nopined Mother suffered from bipolar disorder, which she refused to acknowledge\r\nor treat. Dr. Paez observed that Mother's bipolar disorder often causes her to have\r\ndelusional thoughts and become \"agitated, loud, almost nonstop talking, very\r\nangry, [and] blaming everybody for her problems.\" Mother's testimony also\r\npresented several delusional stories and accusations, including accusations that a\r\nDSS caseworker slapped and ran her over with a car; several co-workers attempted\r\nto kill her by pouring paint thinner down her throat; her former husband kidnapped\r\nher children; and a second DSS caseworker kidnapped and beat her. Moreover,\r\ntestimony shows Mother becomes easily angry and agitated. Dr. Paez further\r\ntestified Mother could possibly care for Child but only if she accepted treatment\r\nand DSS strictly supervised Mother for a year or two. However, we do not believe\r\nMother will be able to provide minimally acceptable care for Child because\r\nevidence in the record reflects Mother has struggled with bipolar disorder without\r\naccepting treatment. Mother's mother stated Mother was previously admitted to\r\npsychiatric facilities on three separate occasions. Mother also lost custody of her\r\nfirst two children because she could not control her anger and filed false police\r\nreports. Accordingly, we find clear and convincing evidence shows Mother has a\r\ndiagnosable condition, which is unlikely to change in a reasonable time, and this\r\ncondition makes Mother unlikely to provide minimally acceptable care for the\r\nchild. S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2570(6) (Supp. 2012).\r\n\r\nFinally, we conclude TPR and adoption is in Child's best interest. Mother argues\r\nTPR is premature because she is making progress with the treatment plan. In\r\nSouth Carolina Department of Social Services v. Janice C., 383 S.C. 221, 230, 678\r\nS.E.2d 463, 468 (Ct. App. 2009), we found the family court erred in finding TPR\r\nwas in the children's best interest because the mother was making progress on her\r\n\ntreatment plan, and the guardian ad litem (GAL) and mother's psychologist never\r\nobserved the mother interacting with her children. This case is factually\r\ndistinguishable from Janice C. because Child's GAL, Child's counselor, and the\r\nDSS caseworker observed Mother's visits with Child caused Child to suffer such\r\nextreme anxiety that she tore off a fingernail from biting it and continuously\r\nscratched behind her ear until she created a yeast infection. Child's counselor\r\nobserved that she became despondent, sad, quiet, and lethargic during visits with\r\nMother. Child's counselor further stated TPR and adoption is in Child's best\r\ninterest because Mother \"is an extremely angry and potentially always aggressive\r\nperson,\" which frightens Child and causes her to \"shut . . . down.\" Unlike Janice\r\nC., Child's foster parents are considering adopting her if TPR is granted, and her\r\npaternal grandparents have also expressed an interest in adopting her.

Additionally, Mother argues the family court erred in allowing DSS to\r\namend its complaint at trial to add an additional statutory ground for TPR. We\r\naffirm.1\r\n\r\n\"[B]efore parental rights can be forever terminated, the alleged grounds for the\r\ntermination must be established by clear and convincing evidence.\" Charleston\r\nCnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Marccuci, 396 S.C. 218, 224, 721 S.E.2d 768, 772\r\n(2011). On appeal from the family court, this court reviews factual and legal\r\nissues de novo. Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C. 412, 414, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667\r\n(2011). Although this court reviews the family court's findings de novo, we are not\r\nrequired to ignore the fact that the trial court, who saw and heard the witnesses,\r\nwas in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight\r\nto their testimony. Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 385, 709 S.E.2d 650, 652 (2011).\r\nThe burden is upon the appellant to convince this court that the family court erred\r\nin its findings. Id. at 391, 709 S.E.2d at 655. The family court may order TPR\r\nupon finding one or more of eleven statutory grounds satisfied and also finding\r\nTPR is in the best interest of the child. S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2570 (2010 &\r\nSupp. 2012). In a TPR action, the best interest of the child is the paramount\r\nconsideration. S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Smith, 343 S.C. 129, 133, 538 S.E.2d\r\n285, 287 (Ct. App. 2000). \"The interests of the child shall prevail if the child's\r\ninterest and the parental rights conflict.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2620 (2010).\r\n\r\nWe find clear and convincing evidence shows Mother willfully failed to support\r\nChild. See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2570(4) (2010) (stating a statutory ground for\r\n\r\n1   We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\nTPR is met where \"[t]he child has lived outside the home of either parent for a\r\nperiod of six months, and during that time the parent has wilfully failed to support\r\nthe child\"). Here, Child has lived outside the home for well over six months.\r\nMother has not supported Child other than buying one lunch, which is not a\r\nmaterial contribution. See S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. M.R.C.L., 393 S.C. 387, 394,\r\n712 S.E.2d 452, 456 (2011) (finding occasionally providing child with food and\r\nother items does not constitute a material contribution); S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-\r\n2570(4) (\"Failure to support means that the parent has failed to make a material\r\ncontribution to the child's care. A material contribution consists of either financial\r\ncontributions according to the parent's means or contributions of food, clothing,\r\nshelter, or other necessities for the care of the child according to the parent's\r\nmeans.\"). Additionally, during the times Mother was not incarcerated, she earned\r\nincome, yet failed to pay child support. Moreover, Mother's repeated incarceration\r\nand failure to rehabilitate \"manifests a conscious indifference to the rights of the\r\nchild to receive support and consortium from the parent.\" See Charleston Cnty.\r\nDep't of Soc. Servs. v. Jackson, 368 S.C. 87, 97, 627 S.E.2d 765, 771 (Ct. App.\r\n2006) (\"Willful conduct is conduct that evinces a settled purpose to forego parental\r\nduties . . . because it manifests a conscious indifference to the rights of the child to\r\nreceive support and consortium from the parent.\" (citation and quotation marks\r\nomitted)). Accordingly, the family court did not err in finding Mother willfully\r\nfailed to support Child.\r\n\r\nWe find clear and convincing evidence shows Mother failed to remedy the\r\nconditions which caused Child's removal. See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2570(2)\r\n(2010) (stating a statutory ground for TPR is met where \"[t]he child . . . has been\r\nout of the home for a period of six months following the adoption of a placement\r\nplan by court order . . . and the parent has not remedied the conditions which\r\ncaused the removal\"). DSS removed Child from Mother for lack of supervision\r\nand failure to maintain stable housing after she left Child unsupervised at a\r\nwomen's shelter for four hours. In December 2010, Mother agreed to a placement\r\nplan, which required her to do the following within thirty days after her release\r\nfrom incarceration: (1) cooperate with DSS; (2) enroll in and successfully complete\r\nparenting classes; (3) receive a substance abuse evaluation; (4) secure and maintain\r\nstable housing for six consecutive months; (5) secure and maintain stable\r\nemployment for six consecutive months; and (6) pay child support in the amount of\r\none hundred dollars per month. Mother failed to successfully complete parenting\r\nclasses and also failed to receive a substance abuse evaluation within thirty days of\r\nher release from incarceration in March 2011. Furthermore, Mother also failed to\r\nobtain stable housing and stable employment. Finally, Mother failed to pay child\r\n\nsupport. Accordingly, the family court did not err in finding Mother failed to\r\nremedy the conditions which caused Child's removal.\r\n\r\nWe find clear and convincing evidence shows Child had been in foster care for\r\nfifteen of the most recent twenty-two months. See § 63-7-2570(8) (2010) (stating a\r\nstatutory ground for TPR is satisfied when the child has been in foster care under\r\nthe responsibility of the State for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months).\r\nAt the time of the TPR hearing, Child had lived in foster care for twenty-four\r\nconsecutive months. Additionally, we disagree with Mother's argument that\r\ncircumstances exist that render TPR improper under this statutory ground. See\r\nMarccuci, 396 S.C. at 227, 721 S.E.2d at 773 (finding TPR was improper under\r\nthe ground that the minor child had been in foster care for at least fifteen of the\r\nmost recent twenty-two months where multiple continuance requests by DSS\r\n\"stymied\" father from regaining custody prior to the end of the fifteen month\r\nperiod). Unlike Marccuci, Child has remained continuously in foster care because\r\nMother has been incarcerated for nineteen of the last twenty-four months.\r\nAdditionally, any delays in this litigation are attributable to both parties.\r\nSpecifically, DSS received a two-week continuance on November 14, 2011, and a\r\none-month continuance on August 4, 2010. Likewise, Mother's counsel received a\r\ntwo-month continuance on November 28, 2011, and a six-week continuance on\r\nMay 7, 2012. Accordingly, clear and convincing evidence supports TPR on this\r\nground.2\r\n\r\n\r\n2 We find the family court did not err in allowing DSS to amend its complaint at\r\nthe TPR hearing to add this ground for TPR. See Rule 15(a), SCRCP (stating leave\r\nto amend a pleading \"shall be freely given when justice so requires and does not\r\nprejudice any other party\"); Armstrong v. Collins, 366 S.C. 204, 228, 621 S.E.2d\r\n368, 380 (Ct. App. 2005) (\"The prejudice that Rule 15 contemplates is lack of\r\nnotice that the new issue is to be tried and lack of a full opportunity to introduce\r\ntestimony to refute it.\"); Lee v. Bunch, 373 S.C. 654, 661, 647 S.E.2d 197, 201\r\n(2007) (finding no prejudice where there was no indication the party opposing the\r\namendment would have presented additional or different evidence related to the\r\nnew issue). Additionally, any argument that DSS should have been estopped from\r\namending its complaint is not preserved for our review. See Barrow v. Barrow,\r\n394 S.C. 603, 615, 716 S.E.2d 302, 309 (Ct. App. 2011) (holding an argument not\r\nraised to the family court either at trial or in a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion is not\r\npreserved for review). Furthermore, even if the family court erred by allowing the\r\namendment or failing to comply with Rule 15(b), SCRCP, and \"stat[ing] in the\r\n\nWe find clear and convincing evidence in the record shows TPR was in Child's\r\nbest interest. The best interest of the child is the paramount consideration.

Code Ann. § 63-7-2620.\r\nMother's incarceration has caused Child to spend almost half of her life in foster\r\ncare. During this time, Child has thrived in a stable environment. Child is enrolled\r\nin pre-adoptive placement and enjoys a strong bond with her prospective adoptive\r\nparents. Additionally, the Guardian ad Litem opined TPR was in Child's best\r\ninterest. Accordingly, we find clear and convincing evidence that TPR is in Child's\r\nbest interest.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nSHORT, THOMAS, and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecord the reason or reasons for allowing the amendment,\" any error would not\r\naffect the outcome of this case because there are other sufficient grounds to support\r\nTPR.

On appeal, AequiCap argues the trial court\r\nerred because (1) the preapproval endorsement in the insurance policy properly\r\nexcludes coverage in amounts exceeding those required by the South Carolina\r\nFinancial Responsibility Act, and (2) the applicable minimum limit of coverage is\r\n$75,000 because the insured was exempt from commercial motor carrier insurance\r\nrequirements. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1. As an additional sustaining ground, Respondents argue AequiCap did not\r\nappeal the trial court's ruling that if the preapproval provision applied to limit\r\ncoverage for Best, the provision would not limit coverage for Scott, as the named\r\ninsured, for any liability related to his maintenance of the vehicle in question.\r\nThus, Respondents argue this finding is the law of the case. Because AequiCap\r\ndid not appeal the trial court's finding that the preapproval provision does not limit\r\ncoverage for Scott's liability under the policy, we affirm. See Jones v. Lott, 387\r\nS.C. 339, 346, 692 S.E.2d 900, 903 (2010) (\"Under the two issue rule, where a\r\ndecision is based on more than one ground, the appellate court will affirm unless\r\nthe appellant appeals all grounds because the unappealed ground will become the\r\nlaw of the case.\"); Transp.

O'Leary, of O'Leary & Associates, P.A., of\r\n             Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This appeal arises out of Respondent Carol A. Davis' driving\r\nunder the influence (DUI) arrest. The circuit court affirmed the municipal court's\r\ndismissal of the DUI charge. On appeal, the City of Columbia argues: (1) the\r\nmunicipal court and circuit court erred in finding that a second affidavit was not in\r\ncompliance with section 56-5-2953 of the South Carolina Code (2006); (2) the\r\n\ncircuit court erred in applying City of Rock Hill v. Suchenski, 374 S.C. 12, 646\r\nS.E.2d 879 (2007) to affirm the municipal court's dismissal; (3) the municipal court\r\nerred in suppressing the DataMaster breath test results; and (4) the municipal court\r\nerred in suppressing the breath test site video. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1. As to the City's claim that the affidavit complies with section 56-5-2953\r\nbecause the second affidavit was submitted more than one year before the first\r\nhearing and the proper course to rectify any confusion or prejudice would have\r\nbeen to allow the testimony of the officer as to which affidavit was applicable to\r\nthis case, we find no error. See Suchenski, 374 S.C. at 15, 646 S.E.2d at 880\r\n(noting the appellate court's review in criminal cases is limited to correcting the\r\norder of the circuit court for errors of law); State v. Sweat, 386 S.C. 339, 350, 688\r\nS.E.2d 569, 575 (2010) (\"All rules of statutory construction are subservient to the\r\none that the legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the\r\nlanguage used, and that language must be construed in light of the intended\r\npurpose of the statute.\"); Town of Mt.

Moreover, both affidavits conflict with one another and\r\nneither identify the case in any way such as by defendant's name, vehicle, case\r\nnumber, or any other manner. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion. See\r\nState v.

Khoury, of Folks, Khoury & DeVenny, LLC,\r\n            of Lancaster, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Jerome Wagner (Husband) appeals the family court's order\r\ngranting the parties a divorce and awarding Robin Wagner (Wife) fifty percent of\r\nthe marital estate and $31,620.13 in attorney's fees. In addition, Husband appeals\r\nthe family court's order denying Husband's motion for reconsideration of its order\r\nimputing income of $3,000 per month to Husband for purposes of child support.\r\n\nOn appeal, Husband argues the family court erred in (1) its division of marital\r\nproperty, (2) awarding Wife attorney's fees, (3) not awarding Husband\r\n\"management fees\" arising from the sale of certain mobile homes, and (4) imputing\r\nincome to Husband in the amount of $3,000 per month for purposes of child\r\nsupport. We affirm as modified.\r\n\r\n1. As to Husband's argument that the family court erred in dividing the marital\r\nestate, we find that evidence supports the majority of the family court's findings.\r\nSpecifically, of the twenty-one categories of assets challenged by Husband on\r\nappeal, we affirm the family court's order with regard to nineteen of the categories.\r\nHusband failed to present evidence regarding the majority of the property at issue,\r\nand the family court's rulings were supported by evidence presented by Wife. See\r\nLewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 393, 709 S.E.2d 650, 656 (2011) (\"The family court\r\nhas broad discretion in valuing the marital property. A family court may accept the\r\nvaluation of one party over another, and the court's valuation of marital property\r\nwill be affirmed if it is within the range of evidence presented.\" (internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted)); id. (\"We have stated before, and we reiterate here, that a party\r\ncannot sit back at trial without offering proof, then come to this [c]ourt\r\ncomplaining of the insufficiency of the evidence to support the family court's\r\nfindings.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Abercrombie v. Abercrombie, 372\r\nS.C. 643, 647-48, 643 S.E.2d 697, 699 (Ct. App. 2007) (finding that the family\r\ncourt did not err in valuing marital property when the value accepted by the family\r\ncourt was within the range presented at trial); Cox v. Cox, 290 S.C. 245, 248, 349\r\nS.E.2d 92, 93 (Ct. App. 1986) (holding that the husband, who \"ma[de] no effort to\r\ncooperate in identifying and valuing his assets and income, cannot now argue the\r\ndecree is unsupported by the evidence\").\r\n\r\nWe agree with Husband's arguments regarding two of the categories of assets, and\r\nfind the family court erred in including the sums of $44,000 and $17,346 in\r\nHusband's portion of the marital estate. These sums represent amounts owed by\r\nRainbow Enterprises, which is owned by Shawn Griggsby, to Richburg Housing, a\r\ncompany owned and operated by Husband and Wife. The family court included\r\nboth sums in Husband's portion of the marital estate based on its finding that\r\nHusband was in a better position than Wife to collect these debts because of his\r\nclose personal and professional relationship with Griggsby. However, Wife sued\r\nGriggsby as a third-party defendant in Husband and Wife's divorce action, and the\r\nfamily court issued a separate order purportedly resolving all issues between Wife\r\nand Griggsby. In the order, which was filed on April 29, 2011, the family court\r\nstated that the order resolved all issues between Wife/Richburg Housing and\r\nGriggsby and, consequently, separated Griggsby from Husband and Wife's divorce\r\n\naction. Because the April 2011 order purportedly resolved all issues between\r\nWife/Richburg Housing and Griggsby, we hold the family court erred in including\r\namounts allegedly owed by Griggsby to Richburg Housing in the marital estate\r\nand, specifically, in Husband's portion of the marital estate. Accordingly, we\r\nmodify the family court's order to increase the amount owed by Wife to Husband\r\nby $30,673. Alternatively, Wife may transfer to Husband the same value in\r\n\"financed deals\" identified on page fifteen of the family court's final divorce\r\ndecree.\r\n\r\n2. As to Husband's argument that the family court erred in awarding Wife\r\n$31,620.13 in attorney's fees and costs, we find the record supports the family\r\ncourt's ruling.\r\n\r\nIn determining whether an attorney's fee should be awarded, the family court\r\nshould consider the following factors: \"(1) the party's ability to pay his/her own\r\nattorney's fee; (2) beneficial results obtained by the attorney; (3) the parties'\r\nrespective financial conditions; and (4) the effect of the attorney's fee on each\r\nparty's standard of living.\" E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d\r\n812, 816 (1992). Whether an attorney's fee is reasonable is to be determined by:\r\n\"(1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted\r\nto the case; (3) professional standing of counsel; (4) contingency of compensation;\r\n(5) beneficial results obtained; [and] (6) customary legal fees for similar services.\"\r\nGlasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).\r\n\r\nWife's counsel obtained a successful result for Wife. Despite Husband's arguments\r\nto the contrary, the family court found that the vast majority of the property at\r\nissue was marital property and awarded Wife fifty percent of such property. In\r\naddition, the family court awarded Wife child support and imputed income to\r\nHusband in excess of what he claimed he was able to earn. Because each party\r\nreceived approximately $900,000 in assets as the result of the divorce, each party's\r\nability to pay the fees is roughly equal; however, the family court appropriately\r\nconsidered that Husband's \"conduct and contemptuous behavior\" caused Wife to\r\nincur additional attorney's fees. See Spreeuw v. Barker, 385 S.C. 45, 72-73, 682\r\nS.E.2d 843, 857 (Ct. App. 2009) (affirming an award of attorney's fees to wife\r\nbased, in large part, on husband's uncooperative conduct that \"greatly contributed\r\nto the litigation costs associated with [the] action\").\r\n\r\n3. As to whether the family court erred in not awarding Husband \"management\r\nfees\" that he earned from the sales of various mobile homes, we find the evidence\r\nsupported the family court's decision to decline to award Husband such fees.\r\n\nFirst, it appears as though the creation of the management fees was primarily as an\r\naccounting device designed to reduce the income generated from the sales of\r\nmobile homes and not to compensate Husband for those sales. Further, based on\r\ntestimony by Husband and Wife's accountant, to the extent Husband and Wife\r\nintended to pay themselves those fees at some point in the future, Wife was also\r\nentitled to the funds. Finally, Husband presented no evidence at trial of the amount\r\nof management fees for 2008 and 2009 and no evidence beyond his own\r\nunsubstantiated testimony that he was owed $131,000 in management fees for\r\n2007. Based on the above evidence, we find the family court did not err in\r\ndeclining to award Husband \"management fees,\" despite Husband's claim that he\r\nwas entitled to such fees. See Lewis, 392 S.C. at 392, 709 S.E.2d at 655 (\"[W]e\r\nrecognize the superior position of the family court judge in making credibility\r\ndeterminations.\").\r\n\r\n4. As to whether the family court erred in imputing $3,000 in income to Husband\r\nfor purposes of child support, we affirm.\r\n\r\nThe family court has the discretion to impute income to a party with respect to\r\nawards of alimony or child support. Sanderson v. Sanderson, 391 S.C. 249, 255,\r\n705 S.E.2d 65, 68 (Ct. App. 2010). If the obligor spouse has the ability to earn\r\nmore income than he is earning, the family court may impute income according to\r\nwhat he could earn by using his best efforts to gain employment equal to his\r\ncapabilities. See Dixon v. Dixon, 334 S.C. 222, 240, 512 S.E.2d 539, 548 (Ct. App.\r\n1999) (citing 24A Am. Jur. 2d Divorce & Separation § 781 (1998)); see also Patel\r\nv. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 532, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004) (stating imputing income\r\nto a party who is voluntarily unemployed or underemployed is appropriate when\r\ndetermining child support obligations). An award of alimony based on such\r\nimputation may be a proper exercise of discretion even if it exhausts the obligor\r\nspouse's actual income. See Dixon, 334 S.C. at 240, 512 S.E.2d at 548.\r\n\r\nHusband contends the family court erred in imputing him income of $3,000 per\r\nmonth because he is currently incapable of earning more than $300 per week.\r\nHusband bases this contention on the current state of the economy and the effects\r\nof the equitable distribution award, which he argues removed his ability to earn\r\nmoney with his former businesses. We find the evidence supports the family\r\ncourt's decision to impute Husband income of $3,000 per month.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the divorce hearing, Husband was earning $300 per week by helping\r\nhis friend and business partner, Shawn Griggsby, who was ill. The evidence\r\nindicates Husband is capable of earning more than $300 per week. Husband built a\r\n\nsuccessful business selling mobile homes during his marriage to Wife and has had\r\nexperience in the mobile home business since he was ten years old. Further,\r\nGriggsby testified that Husband continued to sell mobile homes, campers, and\r\npieces of real property after Husband and Wife separated. Various newspaper\r\nadvertisements referencing Husband's phone number supported this testimony. In\r\naddition, Husband had several years' experience as a successful car salesman.\r\nDespite this experience, Husband claimed that he had not attempted to seek\r\nemployment since December 2008 because he was caring for his ill friend. Based\r\non this evidence, the family court properly found that Husband was\r\nunderemployed. Accordingly, based on Husband's extensive and successful\r\nemployment history, coupled with his admitted failure to attempt to find a job\r\ncommensurate with his experience, we affirm the family court's order imputing\r\nincome of $3,000 per month to him for purposes of child support.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and WILLIAMS and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-121","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Senior Assistant Deputy\r\n        Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney\r\n        General Christina J. Catoe, all of Columbia, and Solicitor\r\n        Barry Barnette, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: Appellant James R. Byers seeks review of his convictions for\r\ndistribution of crack cocaine and distribution of crack cocaine within one-half mile\r\nof a school. Byers argues that the trial court erred in denying his Batson motion.1\r\nWe affirm.\r\n\r\n1. As to Juror # 50, the prosecutor stated that when the Clerk of Court asked\r\nwhether the State wanted to approve Juror # 50, this juror was looking at the\r\ndefense table and smiling in that direction, and, thus, the prosecutor did not feel\r\nthis juror could be fair. \"The demeanor of a prospective juror is generally a race-\r\nneutral reason for employing a peremptory challenge.\" State v. Cochran, 369 S.C.\r\n308, 317, 631 S.E.2d 294, 299 (Ct. App. 2006) (citing State v. Tucker, 334 S.C. 1,\r\n8, 512 S.E.2d 99, 102 (1999))). Because the prosecutor's reason for striking Juror\r\n# 50 was race-neutral on its face, the burden shifted to Appellant to show that the\r\nreason offered for the strike was a mere pretext to engage in purposeful racial\r\ndiscrimination. See Cochran, 369 S.C. at 314-15, 631 S.E.2d at 298 (\"If a race-\r\nneutral explanation is tendered, the trial court must then decide . . . whether the\r\nopponent of the strike has proved purposeful racial discrimination.\" (quoting\r\nPurkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765, 767 (1995))). Appellant did not carry this burden.\r\n\r\nFurther, the trial court should uphold the striking of a juror based on demeanor and\r\ndisposition unless the trial court makes an express finding contrary to counsel's\r\nstated perception of the juror's demeanor and disposition. Id. at 318, 631 S.E.2d at\r\n300. Moreover, the fact that the prosecutor asked the trial court to seat a black\r\nfemale juror before she was ultimately excused for other reasons supports the trial\r\ncourt's determination that the State did not engage in purposeful discrimination.\r\nSee State v. Ford, 334 S.C. 59, 66, 512 S.E.2d 500, 504 (1999) (noting that\r\nalthough the appellant exercised most of his strikes against white jurors, he did not\r\nstrike every white juror); id. (holding the fact that appellant used most of his\r\nchallenges to strike white jurors was not sufficient, in itself, to establish purposeful\r\ndiscrimination).\r\n\r\nFinally, evaluation of a prosecutor's credibility lies within the trial court's province.\r\nSee State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 615-16, 545 S.E.2d 805, 810-11 (2001) (\"Often\r\nthe demeanor of the challenged attorney will be the best and only evidence of\r\ndiscrimination, and 'evaluation of the prosecutor's mind lies peculiarly within a\r\ntrial judge's province.'\" (quoting Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 365\r\n(1991))).\r\n\r\n1   Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).\r\n\nBased on the foregoing, there is support in the record for the trial court's finding\r\nthat the prosecutor's reason for striking Juror # 50 was not a pretext. Therefore, the\r\ntrial court's denial of Appellant's Batson motion on the basis of this particular\r\nstrike was not clearly erroneous. See Shuler, 344 S.C. at 620, 545 S.E.2d at 813\r\n(\"A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by the record.\"); id. at 615,\r\n545 S.E.2d at 810 (\"Appellate courts give the trial judge's finding great deference\r\non appeal, and review the trial judge's ruling with a clearly erroneous standard.\").\r\n\r\n2. Appellant argues the trial court improperly found the State's strike against Juror\r\n# 50 to be constitutional without any indication of whether this juror actually\r\nsmiled at the defense table. However, defense counsel did not dispute this fact\r\nbefore the trial court. Therefore, it is not preserved for our review. See State v.\r\nDunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 694 (2003) (\"A party may not argue\r\none ground at trial and an alternate ground on appeal.\").\r\n\r\n3. As to Juror # 83, the prosecutor struck this juror because she believed he had\r\nconvictions for driving under the influence, criminal domestic violence, possession\r\nof marijuana, and possession of stolen goods. Defense counsel conceded that the\r\nprosecutor's recitation of this criminal history was not a pretext for discrimination.\r\nAfter the prosecutor discovered that Juror # 83 did not have any convictions, she\r\nacknowledged her mistake. Nonetheless, the trial court concluded that the\r\nprosecutor did not exercise her strike against Juror # 83 in an unconstitutional\r\nmanner, and defense counsel did not seek a remedy for the prosecutor's mistake.\r\nTherefore, Appellant may not complain of this mistake for the first time on appeal.\r\nSee State v. Johnson, 363 S.C. 53, 58-59, 609 S.E.2d 520, 523 (2005) (\"If a party\r\nfails to properly object, the party is procedurally barred from raising the issue on\r\nappeal.\").\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and GEATHERS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-122","title":"State v.

Osmanski appeals the decision of the Appellate Panel of\r\nthe South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission (Appellate Panel)\r\ndenying him benefits for his claim arising from an injury to his left arm, arguing\r\nthe Appellate Panel erred in (1) failing to apply a clear and convincing standard of\r\nproof to Watkins & Shepard Trucking, Inc.

We affirm.\r\n\r\n1. As to Osmanski's argument that the Appellate Panel failed to apply a clear and\r\nconvincing standard of proof to WST and Zurich's defense of fraud in the\r\napplication, we find no error. Our supreme court has previously applied a\r\npreponderance of evidence standard to this defense. See Brayboy v.

Accordingly, the\r\nAppellate Panel did not err in failing to apply a clear and convincing evidence\r\nstandard to WST and Zurich's fraud in the application defense.\r\n\r\n2. As to Osmanski's argument that the Appellate Panel erred in barring Osmanski's\r\nclaim due to fraud in the application, we find no error. Substantial evidence\r\nsupported the Appellate Panel's finding that (1) Osmanski made a material\r\nmisrepresentation regarding a prior injury to his left arm when applying for\r\nemployment with WST; (2) WST relied upon this misrepresentation when hiring\r\nOsmanski; and (3) Osmanski's injury to his left arm giving rise to his claim for\r\nbenefits was causally related to his misrepresentation. See S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-\r\n380 (Supp. 2012) (providing that an appellate court \"may not substitute its\r\njudgment for the judgment of the [Appellate Panel] as to the weight of the\r\nevidence on questions of fact\" and must affirm the decision of the Appellate Panel\r\nif it is supported by substantial evidence). Specifically, we find substantial\r\nevidence indicated that Osmanski previously injured his left arm in an accident,\r\nresulting in several surgeries, including a left elbow replacement. Because of this\r\ninjury, Osmanski's treating physician permanently restricted him to lifting no more\r\nthan ten to fifteen pounds with his left arm. In addition, evidence indicated\r\nOsmanski failed to disclose the prior injury or his restrictions to WST during the\r\napplication process and that WST relied upon this information when hiring him.\r\nFinally, it is undisputed that Osmanski's injury was causally related to the\r\nimpairments to his left arm resulting from his prior injury. Accordingly, the\r\nAppellate Panel did not err in applying the fraud in the application offense to bar\r\nOsmanski's claim. See Brayboy, 383 S.C. at 467, 681 S.E.2d at 569 (\"[A]n\r\nemployment relationship may be vitiated when there is a material\r\nmisrepresentation in the employment contract.\"); see also Cooper v. McDevitt &\r\nSt. Co., 260 S.C. 463, 468, 196 S.E.2d 833, 835 (1973) (providing that an\r\n\nemployment relationship may be vitiated if (1) the employee knowingly and\r\nwillfully made a false representation as to his physical condition; (2) the employer\r\nrelied upon the false representation and the reliance was a substantial factor in the\r\nhiring of the employee; and (3) the injury had a causal connection to the false\r\nrepresentation).\r\n\r\n3. As to Osmanski's claim that the Appellate Panel erred in denying Osmanski\r\nbenefits on the ground that his injury was not accidental, we find no error.\r\nSubstantial evidence supported the Appellate Panel's finding that Osmanski's\r\ninjury was not unexpected due to the impairments resulting from the prior injury to\r\nhis left arm. See S.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-160 (Supp. 2012) (defining a\r\ncompensable injury as one \"by accident arising out of and in the course of\r\nemployment\"); Stokes v. First Nat'l Bank, 306 S.C. 46, 50, 410 S.E.2d 248, 250\r\n(1991) (\"[I]n determining whether something constitutes an 'injury by accident' the\r\nfocus is not on some specific event, but rather on the injury itself.\"); Capers v.\r\nFlautt, 305 S.C. 254, 256, 407 S.E.2d 660, 661 (Ct. App. 1991) (\"The word\r\naccident has been applied by our courts in the workers' compensation context to\r\nmean an unlooked for or untoward event that the injured person did not expect,\r\ndesign or intentionally cause.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Because\r\nOsmanski knew the requirements of the position with WST exceeded the\r\nrestrictions placed upon him by his treating physician as the result of the prior\r\ninjury to his left arm, Osmanski's injury was not unexpected and, thus, was not\r\ncompensable. See Capers, 305 S.C. at 257, 407 S.E.2d at 661-62 (finding that a\r\nclaimant's contact dermatitis resulting from the performance of his duties as a\r\ndishwasher was not accidental when a physician had previously diagnosed the\r\nclaimant with the condition and declared him totally disabled from work involving\r\nexposure to soaps, detergents, and/or water); Havird v. Columbia YMCA, 308 S.C.\r\n397, 00, 418 S.E.2d 329, 331 (Ct. App. 1992) (finding substantial evidence\r\nsupported the Appellate Panel's denial of benefits to a claimant who suffered from\r\nvaricose veins as the result of prolonged standing because the claimant knew\r\nprolonged standing would worsen his condition).\r\n\r\n4. As to Osmanski's claim that the Appellate Panel erred in failing to award\r\nOsmanski benefits pursuant to section 42-9-35 of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n2012), we find this argument is not preserved for our review. See Robbins v.\r\nWalgreens & Broadspire Servs., Inc., 375 S.C. 259, 266, 652 S.E.2d 90, 94 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2007) (holding that an argument not raised to and ruled upon by the\r\nAppellate Panel is not preserved for appellate review).\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\nHUFF, WILLIAMS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-128","title":"City of Conway v.

(Hightrak) on the ground that Smalls' claims against\r\nHightrak are barred by the Workers' Compensation Act.1\r\n\r\n1. As to whether the circuit court erred in concluding that Coreas was an employee\r\nof Detyens Shipyard (Detyens) at the time of his alleged negligence, we affirm.\r\nDetyens' president, David Loy Stewart Jr., testified that Detyens used Hightrak to\r\nfill its labor requirements for ongoing projects when Detyens did not have enough\r\npermanent employees to fill those needs. Detyens and Hightrak had an ongoing\r\nagreement requiring Detyens to pay Hightrak a certain amount per hour for skilled\r\nlabor and a different amount per hour for unskilled labor. Stewart also testified\r\nthat Detyens filtered the laborers to make sure they were qualified to perform the\r\nrequired tasks. According to the hull superintendent, James Skiles, this filtering\r\nincluded testing the laborers to make sure they were competent at their stated skill.\r\nFurther, Detyens required laborers who were sent from Hightrak to follow the\r\nsame workplace practices that Detyens' permanent employees had to follow, and\r\nDetyens had the authority to terminate the laborers sent from Hightrak. While\r\nDetyens did not have the authority to terminate an employee from his employment\r\nwith Hightrak, Detyens did have the authority to terminate that employee's\r\nresponsibilities with Detyens. Moreover, Leo Fary, treasurer of Detyens, stated in\r\nhis affidavit that Detyens provided all of the tools used by laborers sent by\r\nHightrak to Detyens, and these laborers worked under the direction and\r\nsupervision of a Detyens manager.\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the circuit court correctly concluded, as a matter of law,\r\nthat Coreas was an employee of Detyens at the time of his alleged negligence. See\r\nRule 56(c), SCRCP (providing that summary judgment shall be granted when \"the\r\npleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together\r\nwith the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material\r\nfact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law\"\r\n(emphasis added)); Nix v.

Code Ann. § 42-1-10 to -42-19-50 (1985 & Supp. 2012).\r\n\nto be done but also to the manner of performing it\" (citing Parker v. Williams &\r\nMadjanik, 269 S.C. 662, 239 S.E.2d 487 (1977))).\r\n\r\n2. To the extent that Smalls' complaint may be interpreted to assert Hightrak's\r\nvicarious liability for Coreas' alleged negligence, such a claim is barred by section\r\n42-5-10 of the South Carolina Code (1985),2 which provides that an employee who\r\nnegligently injures another employee while in the scope of employment is immune\r\nfrom personal liability. See Strickland v. Galloway, 348 S.C. 644, 647, 560 S.E.2d\r\n448, 449 (Ct. App. 2002) (\"[A] co-employee who negligently injures another\r\nemployee while in the scope of employment is immune under the Workers'\r\nCompensation Act and cannot be held personally liable.\"); cf. Guillory v. Gukutu,\r\n534 F. Supp.2d 267, 274 (D.R.I. 2008) (holding an injured worker's estate was\r\nbarred from bringing a respondeat superior action against a staffing agency, who\r\nwas the nominal employer of the allegedly negligent co-worker, because the co-\r\nworker, as a borrowed servant of the injured worker's employer, was immune from\r\nliability under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act and, thus,\r\nthe injured worker's estate could not assert against the staffing agency its non-\r\nexistent right against the co-worker).\r\n\r\n3. Smalls argues that a material issue of fact existed as to whether Hightrak was a\r\nsubcontractor for Detyens. However, it is undisputed that Hightrak was not\r\nperforming any shipyard-related work at the time of Coreas' alleged negligence.\r\nHence, there exists no issue of fact that is truly material to the determination that\r\nHightrak was not a subcontractor. See Murray v. Aaron Mizell Trucking Co., 286\r\nS.C. 351, 355, 334 S.E.2d 128, 130 (Ct. App. 1985) (\"[A] subcontractor is an\r\nindependent contractor contracting with the contractor to do part of the work which\r\n\r\n2   Section 42-5-10 states:\r\n\r\n               Every employer who accepts the compensation\r\n               provisions of this Title shall secure the payment of\r\n               compensation to his employees in the manner provided in\r\n               this chapter. While such security remains in force he or\r\n               those conducting his business shall only be liable to any\r\n               employee who elects to come under this Title for\r\n               personal injury or death by accident to the extent and in\r\n               the manner specified in this Title.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\nthe contractor has previously agreed to perform.\"); see also Meyer v. Piggly Wiggly\r\nNo. 24, Inc., 331 S.C. 261, 267, 500 S.E.2d 190, 193 (Ct. App. 1998), aff'd, 338\r\nS.C. 471, 527 S.E.2d 761 (2000) (holding an agreement between a grocery store\r\nand a wholesale bakery was for the sale and delivery of a commodity and, thus, the\r\nbakery was not the grocery store's subcontractor).\r\n\r\n4. As to Smalls' assertion that his claim against Hightrak for the negligent hiring,\r\ntraining, and supervision of Coreas should have survived summary judgment, we\r\naffirm.      'In circumstances where an employer knew of or should\r\n             have known that its employment of a specific person\r\n             created an undue risk of harm to the public, a plaintiff\r\n             may claim that the employer was itself negligent in hiring\r\n             . . . . the employee . . . .' Negligent hiring cases 'generally\r\n             turn on two fundamental elements—knowledge of the\r\n             employer and foreseeability of harm to third parties.'\r\n             Although foreseeability is usually an issue of fact, 'the\r\n             court should dispose of the matter on a dispositive\r\n             motion when no reasonable factfinder could find the risk\r\n             foreseeable or the employer's conduct to have fallen\r\n             below the acceptable standard.'\r\n\r\nKase v. Ebert, 392 S.C. 57, 63, 707 S.E.2d 456, 459 (Ct. App. 2011) (internal\r\ncitations omitted). Here, there is nothing in the record to indicate that Hightrak\r\nknew or should have known that Coreas would be a danger to his co-workers or\r\nthat Hightrak could foresee any harm to third parties. Further, the evidence shows\r\nthat Detyens assumed the training and supervision of Coreas. Therefore, even\r\nthough the circuit court did not specifically address the grounds for his summary\r\njudgment ruling as to the negligent hiring, training, and supervision cause of\r\naction, we affirm the ruling.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and GEATHERS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"}]
