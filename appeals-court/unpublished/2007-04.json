Â At the urging of the parties, the court accepted the settlement on the record.Â  Subsequently, Appellant failed to sign the consent order reflecting the terms of the settlement previously agreed upon.Â  Respondent moved to enforce the settlement agreement.

Dixon Lee, James T. McLaren, Jan L. Warner, of Columbia, for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.:Â  In this domestic action, William Robert Simpson (Husband) appeals the family courtâ€™s order, arguing the family court erred in (1) failing to rule on his motion for a retroactive decrease in alimony and a return of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs; (2) its award of equitable distribution; (3) awarding his former wife, Daisy Wallace Simpson (Wife) alimony; (4) Â finding Husbandâ€™s yearly income is $150,000 per year; (5) its valuation of property; (6) characterizing him as not having cooperated in the discovery process; and (7) awarding Wife attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  Wife also appeals the award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nHusband and Wife married in 1968, and resided in Clarendon County, South Carolina throughout the duration of the marriage.Â  When the couple first married, they bought a mobile home and lived on property owned by Husbandâ€™s father. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn 1971, Husbandâ€™s father died, and his will left a life estate in the Simpson family home to Husbandâ€™s mother, with the remainder to Husband.Â  Husband asked Wife to quit her job at a manufacturing plant in Manning to stay home with his mother.Â  The couple moved into the house and lived there throughout the remainder of the marriage.Â  Husbandâ€™s mother lived at the house for one year until she remarried.Â  Although Husbandâ€™s interest in the house did not fully vest until his motherâ€™s death in 1991, the couple substantially renovated the home.Â  Husband and Wife completed most of the renovations themselves.Â  The couple has three children. Two of the children are emancipated and the youngest was attending college at the time of the hearing.Â  Â Â \r\nDuring the marriage, Wife had several outside jobs but primarily stayed at home and took care of the family.Â  Husband became a successful farmer and land owner and eventually developed some of his land into residential lots.Â  Â Â Â \r\nIn 1989, pursuant to a hand-written agreement between William Simpson, Jr., (Simpson, Jr.) and Husband, Simpson, Jr. began working for Husband.Â  The agreement provided that Simpson, Jr. would work on the family farm for $120 per week.Â  In exchange for his low salary, Husband would provide Simpson, Jr. with equity in the land and farm machinery.Â  In 2000, a month after Husband and Wife reconciled, Husband began to transfer most of the property he owned into Simpson Farms, L.L.C. (the LLC).Â  \r\nThe couple separated three times during the marriage.Â  The first separation occurred in the 1980â€™s and the second in 1999.Â  In 1999, the parties began formal litigation, but they reconciled in 2000.Â  The partiesâ€™ final separation occurred in 2003.Â  \r\nAfter the parties reconciled in 2000, Wife began attending real estate classes and eventually earned her real estate license.Â  Husband did not approve of Wifeâ€™s pursuit of her real estate license and did not speak to her during this time.Â  Husband purchased and sold numerous properties, often using other real estate agents.Â  Â Â \r\nOn March 4, 2003, Wife filed this action against Husband, the LLC, and Simpson, Jr.[1] Â Wife also requested, inter alia, separate support and maintenance, equitable division of the marital estate, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  At the temporary hearing, the family court ordered Husband to pay Wife $1,000 per month pendente lite spousal support.Â  Further, the family court ordered Husband to advance Wife $15,000 pendente lite attorneyâ€™s fees with the caveat that the family court could treat the fees as a credit toward Wifeâ€™s equitable apportionment at the final hearing.Â  \r\nMost of the three day trial concerned the value of Husbandâ€™s vast property holdings and the amount of Husbandâ€™s income.Â  Husband testified he did not know exactly what he owned.Â  In many instances, the value Husband assigned to his properties and assets contradicted what he reported on his tax returns. Â Further, Husband testified the LLC never filed a tax return nor did it have an operating account. Â Although Husband denied selling his interest in S &amp; T Land Developers (S &amp; T) after litigation commenced, a deed dated March 10, 2003â€”six days after Wife instituted her actionâ€”showed that Husband transferred his fifty percent interest to Ray Tidwell for $5.Â  During trial, Wifeâ€™s expert testified the value of Husbandâ€™s fifty percent interest in S &amp; T was $318,000.Â  Husband also testified that he pays Simpson, Jr. a different amount each year.Â  He could not recall what he paid his son the previous year.Â  \r\nThe family court found that Husband and Simpson, Jr. were not credible witnesses.Â  The family court based its decision, in part, on testimony of Husbandâ€™s witness, Tracy Amos, a certified public accountant. Â Amos admitted Husband undervalued assets, failed to report to her his antique car collection, and failed to report on his tax return a sale of timber for $40,000.Â  The family court found Husband repeatedly testified that he did not know what he owned. Â In his responses to discovery it appeared that he made â€œlittle effortâ€ to assist his lawyer or the court to identify what he owned.Â  The family court also found Husband testified that he purchased property with cash to assist sellers in avoiding taxation.Â  Ultimately, the family court found Husband tried to hide his true income and ultimately determined his income was $150,000, which was the amount he reported to banks and other lending institutions.Â  \r\nThe family court awarded Wife $1,000 per month in periodic permanent alimony and awarded her 34% of the marital property, valued at $784,055.Â  In making an equitable division of the marital property, the family court recognized the existence of the LLC and awarded Wife half of Husbandâ€™s fifty percent interest, while leaving Simpson, Jr.â€™s fifty percent interest intact.Â  The family court reserved the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs and asked that both parties submit affidavits regarding fees and costs no later than January 15, 2005.Â  \r\nOn January 11, 2005, Husband filed a Rule 59(e) motion asking the family court to reconsider its order.Â  The morning of the hearing on the Rule 59(e) motion and the remaining issue of attorneyâ€™s fees, the clerk of court brought the family court the Notice of Appeal filed by Husband.Â  The family court took the position that the filing of the notice divested it of jurisdiction to hear the Rule 59(e) motion, and Husbandâ€™s attorney agreed.Â  Thereafter, the family court dismissed the Rule 59(e) motion and proceeded with the attorneyâ€™s fees hearing.Â  After the hearing, the family court awarded Wife $85,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  Both parties appeal.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family court, this Court has the authority to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).Â  This broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings, and we remain mindful of the fact the family court, who saw and heard the parties, is in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign weight to their testimony.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981).\r\nISSUES\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Husbandâ€™s Appeal\r\n\r\n  \r\n    A. \r\n    Did the family court err in failing to rule on Husband&rsquo;s post-trial motion for a retroactive decrease in alimony and a return of attorney&rsquo;s fees and costs awarded to Wife at the temporary hearing?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    B.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the family court err in its equitable division of the marital property?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    C.\r\n    Did the family court err in awarding wife alimony?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    D.\r\n    Did the family court err in finding Husband&rsquo;s yearly income was $150,000?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    E.\r\n    Did the family court err in its valuation of Husband&rsquo;s properties?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    F.\r\n    Did the family court improperly characterize Husband as uncooperative in the discovery process?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    G.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the family court err by awarding Wife attorney&rsquo;s fees?\r\n  \r\n\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wifeâ€™s Appeal\r\n\r\n  \r\n    A.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the family court err in failing to award Wife the full amount of requested attorney&rsquo;s fees and costs?\r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Husbandâ€™s Appeal\r\nA.Â  Post-trial Motion\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in failing to rule on his Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion for a decrease in alimony and a return of temporary attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 205, SCACR, provides that upon service of the Notice of Appeal, â€œthe appellate court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the appeal . . . .â€Â  In Elam v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., the South Carolina Supreme Court recognized â€œthat a party may attempt to file both a Rule 59(e) motion and a notice of appeal.Â  If [that] does occur, one or the other will be inappropriate . . . .â€Â  361 S.C. 9, 20, 602 S.E.2d 772, 778 (2004) (citing Hudson v. Hudson, 290 S.C. 215, 216, 349 S.E.2d 341, 342 (1986) (holding that when a timely post-trial motion is pending before the lower court, any notice of appeal will be dismissed without prejudice as premature)).Â  Under Elam and Hudson the appellant should notify the appellate court of the pending post-trial motion in writing, and the clerk will dismiss the case with prejudice. Â Rule 225, SCACR offers the alternative of moving the appellate court to lift the automatic stay of the lower court proceedings so that the post trial motion may be heard.\r\nHusband exercised neither of these options which would have kept jurisdiction in the family court.Â  In fact, Husband agreed with the family court that the Court of Appeals had exclusive jurisdiction once the notice of appeal had been filed.Â  In any event, even though the family court dismissed Husbandâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion, we find the divorce decree did address Husbandâ€™s arguments concerning a reduction in Wifeâ€™s alimony and a return of attorneyâ€™s fees awarded at the temporary hearing.Â Â  \r\nThe divorce decree awarded Wife $1,000 per month in permanent periodic alimony.Â  The family court concluded Wife was entitled to alimony pursuant to the statutory factors, and accordingly, the family court denied Husbandâ€™s request for a decrease in the alimony awarded at the pendente lite hearing.\r\nHusband also maintains the family court failed to rule on his motion for a return of the attorneyâ€™s fees and costs, which he paid to Wife at the temporary hearing.Â  After a separate hearing on the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs, the family court issued an order stating â€œin addition to the fees awarded at the temporary hearing, an additional contribution of $85,000 would be reasonable.â€Â  Therefore, the family court took into consideration the pendente lite attorneyâ€™s fees and rejected Husbandâ€™s argument that he was entitled to the money he advanced to Wife during the hearing.Â  Â Â \r\nB.Â Equitable Distribution Award\r\nHusband assigns numerous points of error to the family courtâ€™s equitable distribution of marital assets.Â  First, Husband argues the family court failed to consider the debts of the LLC and farming equipment in making its award. Â Husband also argues the family court erred by awarding certain properties to Wife and awarding the Buck and Bull Country Store to Husband.Â  Lastly, Husband argues the family court improperly awarded Wife a part of the marital home and surrounding acreage that he transferred into the LLC three years previously.Â Â  We address each argument in turn.Â  \r\n1.Â Â Failure to Consider Debts\r\nInitially, we note Husbandâ€™s first assignment of errorâ€”that the family court failed to consider the debts of the LLC and farm equipment when distributing assets to the partiesâ€”is not preserved for our review.Â  To preserve an issue for appellate review, the issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but it must have been raised to and ruled upon by the family court.Â  Charleston County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Jackson,&nbsp; 368 S.C. 87, 104-05, 627 S.E.2d 765, 775&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006) (citing Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (â€œIt is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.â€)).Â  Although Husband made a Rule 59(e) motion, for the reasons stated above, the family court dismissed the motion without a ruling.Â  Therefore, this issue is not preserved.Â  Â \r\nEven if this issue was preserved, we find that any error in the family courtâ€™s failure to properly assess the debt of the LLC stems from Husbandâ€™s lack of candor with the court. Â The apportionment of marital property is within the family courtâ€™s sound discretion, and we will not disturb the apportionment on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 97, 561 S.E.2d 610, 616 (Ct. App. 2002). Â Section 20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) lists fifteen factors for the family court to consider when apportioning the marital estate and vests the family court with the discretion to determine what weight should be assigned to each factor.Â  Thomas v. Thomas, 346 S.C. 20, 25, 550 S.E.2d 580, 583 (Ct. App. 2001). Â On review, we look to the overall fairness of the apportionment, and if the result, taken as a whole, is equitable, courts weighing specific factors differently than the family court is irrelevant.Â  Id.\r\nÂ At the outset, we note the family court did consider Husbandâ€™s debt in lands owned by Husband in conjunction with partners excluding Simpson, Jr.Â  The family court took into account the debts of S &amp; T, which were $184,457, and subtracted that debt from Husbandâ€™s fifty percent interest when it found Husbandâ€™s interest had a value of $218,772.Â  The family court took into consideration the debt on lands owned by Husband and his partner, Mr. Jonte, when assessing the value of Husbandâ€™s interest in those lands as $51,250.Â  Additionally, the family courtâ€™s order specifically lists each factor set forth in section 20-7-472, and under the debt factor provides: â€œIn making the equitable apportionment, as set forth below, the [c]ourt has considered all liabilities in coming up with the marital estate which is after liabilities based on my view of the evidence.â€Â  We also observe that Wifeâ€™s expert testified that none of the properties owned by Husband or the LLC had any recorded mortgages.Â  \r\nHusband points to a handwritten document he submitted to the family court, which purportedly shows his debts, to bolster his argument that the family court erroneously concluded he showed no documentary evidence of debts.Â  We find the family court properly discounted this evidence because to find Husbandâ€™s handwritten document of debts credible, the family court would have to consider Husband to be credible.Â  The record is replete with evidence that Husband undervalued his assets.Â  Further, as noted previously, his fixed asset and equipment records do not match the depreciation schedule on his tax return.Â  Also, when asked how much money he owed banks, Husbandâ€™s reply was â€œI donâ€™t know.â€Â  The family courtâ€™s order plainly states, â€œI find as a fact that the credibility of Defendantâ€™s [sic] Simpson, Jr., and Simpson, Sr., are subject to significant question.â€Â  Therefore, it is evident from the family courtâ€™s order that the court was aware of the statutory factors and considered the debt based on the submitted credible evidence.Â  Accordingly, we find the family court did not err.\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Award of Property and Buck and Bull Country Store\r\nNext, Husband argues the family court erred by awarding property that was in the LLC to Wife and awarding him the Buck and Bull Country Store.Â  Husband contends that the family court could not give Wife certain pieces of real property because they were part of the LLC.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nHusband did not raise this issue to the family court, and the family court dismissed his subsequent Rule 59(e) motion.Â  Therefore, this issue is not preserved for our review.[2]Â  See Hatfield v. Hatfield, 327 S.C. 360, 489 S.E.2d 212 (Ct. App. 1997) (issue must be raised to and ruled on by family court to be preserved for appellate review).Â  \r\nEven if this issue was preserved, we find no merit to Husbandâ€™s claim that the property awarded to Wife was part of the LLC.Â  The family court order distinguishes the property owned individually by Husband from the property owned by the LLC.Â  The family court based its conclusion on research performed by Wifeâ€™s expert who researched public records to ascertain what Husband owned individually, with other partners, and as a member of the LLC.Â  The family court awarded Wife six parcels of property and Husband argues that two of the six parcels were in the LLC.Â  He points to the testimony of one of his expert witnesses who testified: â€œ[I]tem D-7 was purchased two years after the formation of the LLC . . . .â€ Â However, it is unclear from the testimony that D-7 is the piece of property Husband refers to in his brief.Â  Furthermore, it is unclear whether the LLC or Husband purchased the property.Â  As to the second parcel, Husband points to the deed purporting to show the propertyâ€™s transfer into the LLC.Â  The deed shows numerous transfers, and it is unclear as to whether this particular parcel was included in the transfers.Â  \r\nIt was husbandâ€™s burden to show the property had been transferred to the LLC.Â  See Hodge v. Hodge, 305 S.C. 521, 526, 409 S.E.2d 436, 439 (Ct. App. 1991) (â€œA spouse who wishes to claim that certain property is not part of the marital estate has the burden of presenting witnesses or evidence to establish its non-marital character . . . .â€).Â  Since Husband did not present credible evidence to support his contention, he failed to meet that burden.Â  Accordingly, we find the property the family court awarded to Wife was individually owned by Husband, and was not property owned by the LLC.Â  \r\nAs to the award of the Buck and Bull Country Store and surrounding property to Husband, we find no error in the family courtâ€™s decision.Â  Simpson, Jr. operates the store, and the record indicates the store is thriving.Â Â Â  The family court is vested with the authority to apportion marital property, and we can discern no error in the family courtâ€™s decision to award Husband the store, especially in light of the contentious relationship between Simpson, Jr. and Wife.Â  See Rampey v. Rampey,&nbsp;286 S.C. 153, 156, 332 S.E.2d 213, 215&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1985) (â€œApportionment of the marital estate is a matter left to the sound discretion of the family court.â€) (citation omitted).Â  Therefore, we find no merit to Husbandâ€™s contention Wife should have been awarded the store. Â \r\n3.Â Â Award of Interest in Marital Home\r\nNext, Husband argues the family court improperly awarded Wife a part of the marital home and surrounding acreage that he transferred into the LLC three years previously. Â Â Husband contends the family court should have charged him with only half the homeâ€™s value of $122,500, instead of the entire value of $245,000 because Simpson, Jr., as a member of the LLC, owned half of the house.Â  At most, Husband believes Wife was entitled to half of his fifty percent interest in the marital home.Â  We disagree.\r\nHusband does not dispute the family courtâ€™s finding the home he inherited was transmuted into marital property; his only argument is that he transferred the house into the LLC.Â  The family courtâ€™s order provides â€œ[i]t is not clear to the [c]ourt the marital home was ever transferred into the LLC, and it will be considered separately.â€Â  Husbandâ€™s brief points to numerous places in the record that he believes show the marital home was transferred into the LLC.Â  However, these places in the record show only that Husband owned the marital home, along with numerous other properties.Â  Accordingly, because Husband did not meet his burden in showing the marital home was in the LLC, we find the family court properly charged Husband with the homeâ€™s full value.\r\nC.Â Â Alimony Award\r\nHusband argues the family court erred by awarding permanent periodic alimony to Wife.Â  Husband contends Wife makes more than $30,000 and is capable of supporting herself.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe decision to award alimony â€œrests within the sound discretionâ€ of the family court, and absent an abuse of discretion, it will not be disturbed on appeal.Â  Dearbury v. Dearbury, 351 S.C. 278, 282, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002) (citing Clardy v. Clardy, 266 S.C. 270, 222 S.E.2d 771 (1976)).Â  When awarding alimony, the family court must consider and weigh the following statutory factors set forth in section 20-3-130(C) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005):Â  \r\n\r\n  Â (1) the duration of the marriage . . . [and] the ages of the parties at the time of the marriage and at the time of divorce or separate maintenance action . . . ; (2) the physical and emotional condition of each spouse; (3) the educational background of each spouse . . . ; (4) the employment history and earning potential of each spouse; (5) the standard of living established during the marriage; (6) the current and reasonably anticipated earnings of both spouses; (7) the current and reasonably anticipated expenses and needs of both spouses; (8) the marital and nonmarital properties of the parties . . . ; (9) custody of the children . . . ; (10) marital misconduct or fault . . . ; (11) the tax consequences to each party . . . ; (12) the existence and extent of any support obligation from a prior marriage . . . ; and (13) such other factors the court considers relevant.\r\n\r\nIn its final order, the family court thoroughly examined each of the statutory factors and made specific findings under each factor.Â  The family court considered the duration of the marriage, finding the partiesâ€™ marriage was a long-term marriage that spanned thirty-five years.Â  The family court also found that Husband was in good health and that Wife was currently in relatively good health, despite having to take medication for high cholesterol and a rapid heartbeat. Â Further, the family court made extensive findings regarding the employment history and earning potential of each spouse.Â  The focus of these findings primarily centered on Husbandâ€™s attempt to hide his income. Â The family court ultimately concluded that Husbandâ€™s income and assets greatly exceeded what he reported in his financial declaration.Â  The family court found Husbandâ€™s income to be $155,000 per year.Â  Notably, the family court considered Husbandâ€™s assertion that he did not have the funds sufficient to support Wife; however, he did have funds to continue purchasing assets in the name of S &amp; T, a company in which he claims to have no ownership.Â  The family court found that the children attended private schools, Husband owned an antique car collection, and the parties extensively renovated their home.Â  The family court concluded the parties had an upper middle class family lifestyle.\r\nThe family court found that although Wife initially quit her job at Husbandâ€™s insistence to be a homemaker, she is currently employed as a real estate agent.Â  The family court further found that Wife works solely on a commission basis and that during the six-month period from January 1 to June 15, 2004, her gross revenue on homes she sold was $30,555.Â  Out of the $30,555, the real estate company, Agent Owned Realty, withheld $10,928.92 in franchise fees.Â  This finding is corroborated in the record by the testimony of Claude Loadholt, the president of Agent Owned Realty, who testified that Wife pays numerous fees and overhead to the company.Â  Loadholt testified that in addition to franchise fees and overhead Wife pays many of her own expenses, including advertising, automobile, and continuing education expenses.Â  With those expenses in mind, Wifeâ€™s net income for that six-month period can be estimated to be close to $15,000.Â  Therefore, we find the family court correctly concluded her net income was $30,000 per year.Â  Considering the discrepancy in income and the needs of the parties, we hold the family court did not abuse its discretion by awarding alimony.Â  Â Â \r\nD.Â Husbandâ€™s Yearly Income\r\nHusband argues the family court erred when it found his income was $150,000 per year.Â  He contends his income was approximately $60,000-$70,000 per year.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe family court found that Husbandâ€™s annual income was $150,000 per year based upon a NBSC financial statement Husband gave the bank in which he represented his annual income was $150,000 per year.Â  Husband argues that two certified public accountants, Mark Hobbs and Tracey Amos, both found his income was approximately $60,000 per year.Â  This testimony was based upon Husbandâ€™s tax returns, which both experts, when questioned, admitted were not complete.Â  For example, Hobbs testified that neither Husband nor Simpson, Jr.â€™s tax returns show the Buck and Bull Country Store as having either a gain or loss.Â  Further, Hobbs testified it was unusual that Husbandâ€™s general ledger was â€œso differentâ€ from his tax returns.Â  For example, the ledger showed payments to Simpson, Jr. as payments in 2002, but in 2003, the payments to Simpson, Jr. were classified as miscellaneous.Â  Hobbs opined that any time he saw records as â€œmixed upâ€ as Husbandâ€™s, a heightened fraud risk existed because the records indicated that he wanted to change the classification of his assets and liabilities on a yearly basis.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Hobbs found Husbandâ€™s fixed asset and equipment records could not be reconciled to the depreciation schedule on his tax returns.Â  The difference between the two amounted to over $700,000.Â  Hobbs also testified that the LLC has never filed a tax return and because Husband has no formula by which he pays Simpson, Jr., he is able to shift his income around.[3]Â  \r\nAmos testified that Husband informed her he no longer had approximately sixty pieces of farm equipment; however, those assets were listed in the depreciation schedule on his tax return.Â  Further, Husband sold timber for $40,000, and this sale was not listed on his tax return.Â  Moreover, when asked whether Husbandâ€™s intentions could be to dupe Wife out of her interest in the property and at the same time not pay income tax, Amos conceded it was a possibility.Â  \r\nTherefore, the evidence presented at trial showed that Husband made significantly more income than he reported, and he manipulated Simpson, Jr.â€™s income to any level he desired.Â  We find the family court was left with no alternative but to use Husbandâ€™s statement that he submitted to the bank showing his income was $150,000.Â  We also recognize that Husband made no effort to cooperate in identifying his assets and income and â€œcannot complain of an error which his own conduct has induced.â€Â  Cox v. Cox, 290 S.C. 245, 248, 349 S.E.2d 92, 93 (Ct. App. 1986) (citing Shearer v. Deshon, 240 S.C. 472, 126 S.E.2d 514 (1962)); see also Patrick v. Britt, 364 S.C. 508, 513, 613 S.E.2d 541, 543-44 (Ct. App. 2005) (finding when husband failed to provide the court with any meaningful representation of his actual income that husband â€œwould be hard pressed to complain of the family courtâ€™s ruling . . . the court of appeals does not sit to relieve self-inflicted woundsâ€) (citations omitted).Â  Accordingly, we find no error in the family court finding Husbandâ€™s income is $150,000 per year.\r\nE.Â Valuation of Property\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in its valuation of the property owned by the LLC.Â  Husband contends the family court erroneously accepted Wifeâ€™s expertâ€™s value of the land at $1,244 per acre.Â  We disagree. \r\nAgain, we note Husband did not raise this issue to the family court, nor was this issue ruled upon in any subsequent Rule 59(e) motion; therefore, this issue is not preserved for our review. See Riggs v. Riggs, 353 S.C. 230, 237, 578 S.E.2d 3, 6&nbsp;(2003) (citing Hatfield v. Hatfield, 327 S.C. 360, 489 S.E.2d 212 (Ct. App. 1997) (issue must be raised to and ruled on by family court to be preserved for appellate review))[4].\r\nEven if this issue was preserved, we find no error in the family courtâ€™s valuation of the land owned by the LLC.Â  The family court has broad discretion in valuing marital property, and this court will affirm the findings of the family court when the findings below are supported by the evidence. \r\n    Fields v. Fields,&nbsp;342 S.C. 182, 187, 536 S.E.2d 684, 686&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000) (citing Smith v. Smith, 327 S.C. 448, 459, 486 S.E.2d 516, 519 (Ct. App. 1997) (â€œ[A]n appellate court will affirm the family courtâ€™s valuation of marital property if it is within the range of the evidence presented.â€)). \r\nDuring the trial, Husband presented Tracy Amos, a certified public accountant and a certified valuation analyst, as an expert witness.Â  She testified that she valued the total amount of land owned by Husband using the values for each individual property that Husband supplied.Â  Additionally, Amosâ€™ testimony revealed that for one of the properties, Husband submitted to her an appraisal value of $6,500, but that the tax assessment on that property for 2004 was $107,600.Â  Further, she found at least sixty items of farm equipment that Husband no longer owned listed on his depreciation schedule that he submitted to the IRS.Â  In light of the fact Husbandâ€™s own witness could not explain Husbandâ€™s inconsistent reporting of assets nor his undervaluing of his assets, we find no error in the family courtâ€™s decision to forgo using his expertâ€™s valuation.\r\nWife presented Beth Linhardt, a certified and licensed real estate appraiser, as an expert witness.Â  The family court found that Linhardtâ€™s asset listing was â€œinaccurate and based on only one method, comparable sales.â€Â  The family court also found Linhardt had a difficult time determining what property had been acquired and sold by Husband due to the lack of income or expense records maintained by Husband or Simpson, Jr.Â  Further, the family courtâ€™s order found that Linhardt had difficulty determining what property Husband owned because he failed to provide a list of his property, and she had to look in several counties to determine what Husband owned.Â  Linhardt testified she spent 1,248 hours attempting to identify all of the property owned by Husband.Â  \r\nUltimately, Linhardt concluded that the LLCâ€™s assets were $846,650, and that Husbandâ€™s fifty percent share would be half of this value.Â  Because the family court found Linhardtâ€™s valuation was â€œincomplete at best,â€ the court had to make adjustments to the value based on the evidence before it.Â  The record reveals the family court took into consideration Linhardtâ€™s lists of property that showed what Husband owned individually, and what he owned as a member of the LLC.Â  The family court was careful to eliminate the properties on Linhardtâ€™s appraisal which had been duplicated or sold.Â  The family court found the marital home was not in the LLC and subtracted its acreage from the remaining property when it came up with 481.86 acres of property in the LLC.Â  The family court then valued the property at $599,650, which is $1,244 per acre.Â  \r\nAfter reviewing the record, we find the family courtâ€™s rejection of Husbandâ€™s valuation of his property was well within its discretion, especially because Husband presented no credible evidence of valuation.Â  See Smith v. Smith, 294 S.C. 194, 198, 363 S.E.2d 404, 407 (Ct. App. 1987) (â€œThe weight the trial court affords the testimony of witnesses, including parties, is discretionary with the trial court . . . . Â In valuing marital assets, the trial court â€˜is fully within its discretion to choose the valuations of one party over those of the other party.â€™â€) (citations omitted).Â  In this particular case the family court had a difficult task in determining what property Husband owned and in subsequently valuing it.Â  Under the difficult circumstances of this case, the family court valued the property to the best of its ability.Â  Accordingly, we hold that the family court considered fully all of the evidence presented, and we assign no error in the family courtâ€™s determination of the value of the marital property. \r\nF.Â  Discovery \r\nHusband argues the family court improperly characterized him and Simpson, Jr. as uncooperative in the discovery process.Â  We disagree.\r\nAgain, we note this argument, having not been raised to and ruled upon by the family court, is not preserved for our review.Â  See Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505, 511, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715.[5]Â  However, even if this issue was preserved, we find the family court properly characterized Husband as uncooperative in the discovery process.\r\nThe family courtâ€™s order provided:\r\n\r\n  [I]t has been difficult for this [c]ourt to make a final determination of [Husbandâ€™s] assets and income[,] and the [c]ourt has had to cross reference the testimony of all parties and witnesses as no one presented a clear and precise picture of the identification of the marital assets.Â  [Husband] testified on numerous occasions that he did not know what he owned, and his responses to interrogatories and other discovery indicate to the [c]ourt he made little effort to clarify what he owned during the course of this litigation.\r\n\r\nHusbandâ€™s answers to Wifeâ€™s interrogatories begin our inquiry into Husbandâ€™s non-cooperation during the discovery process. Out of the forty-three questions Wife submitted, Husband replied sixteen times â€œthis information is not available at this time.â€Â  Other times, he simply replied that the questions would be answered before the hearing.Â  During his deposition, when Wifeâ€™s counsel asked Husband, â€œWhy didnâ€™t you answer [the interrogatory asking you] to identify the financial institution or lenders by name and address?Â  Is there any reason you didnâ€™t answer that?â€Â  Husbandâ€™s response was â€œNo.â€Â  When asked when he sold property within the last five years, Husbandâ€™s response was â€œI donâ€™t know.â€Â  At one point during his deposition, Husband testified that he â€œdidnâ€™t know exactlyâ€ what he owned.Â  \r\nThe record is replete with examples of Husbandâ€™s stubborn refusal to be candid with the family court.Â  Further, Husband seems to argue that because he submitted numerous documents to the family court, he did comply with discovery; however, his tax returns were incomplete at best, and numerous experts testified to the fact Husband underreported the value of his assets and his income.Â  We find the family court was properly skeptical of any of Husbandâ€™s handwritten submitted documents that he alleges show his financial worth.Â  Accordingly, the family court properly characterized Husband as uncooperative in the discovery process.Â  \r\nG.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in even considering Wifeâ€™s request for fees and costs because her documentation in support of fees was untimely.Â  Husband contends, because Wife did not file a Rule 6(b), SCRCP, motion for an enlargement of time, the family court should not have considered her documentation.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe family courtâ€™s final order provides: â€œThe matter of attorneyâ€™s fees, and costs, and expenses is hereby reserved, and counsel for both Plaintiff and Defendants shall submit to this [c]ourt affidavits . . . not later than January 15, 2005.â€Â  Wife submitted her affidavit for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs on January 18, 2005.Â  Husband contends it was error to award attorneyâ€™s fees without ruling on his motion relating to the timeliness of Wifeâ€™s supporting documentation.Â  However, he did not argue the family courtâ€™s failure to address his motion at the hearing on Wifeâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration of the award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  This issue, not having been ruled upon by the family court, is not preserved for our review.Â  An issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but it must have been raised to and ruled upon by the family court to be preserved for appellate review. Lucas, 359 S.C. at 511, 598 S.E.2d at 715.\r\nEven if this issue was preserved, we find no error in the family courtâ€™s decision to rule on the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  January 15, 2005, was a Saturday.Â  Monday, January 17, 2005 was Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a state and federal holiday and the family court was closed.Â  Wife filed her attorneyâ€™s fee affidavit with the clerk of the family court on the first day the family court was open after January 15.Â  Accordingly, Wifeâ€™s affidavit was timely filed because holidays and the weekends extend court filing deadlines.Â  See Rule 6(a), SCRCP (â€œThe last day of the period so computed is to be included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday or a state or federal holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is neither a Saturday, Sunday nor such holiday.â€).Â  Accordingly, the family court judge did not commit error in ruling on this issue.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â  Wifeâ€™s Appeal\r\nA. Â Â Â Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees &amp; Costs\r\nWife argues the family court erred by not awarding Wife adequate attorneyâ€™s fees and expenses.Â  Further, Wife maintains the family court erroneously limited its consideration of the factor of â€œcustomary legal fees for similar servicesâ€ to the local geographic area where the trial was held.Â  Â \r\nThe total marital estate in this case is valued at nearly $2.4 million.Â  Wife was awarded $1,000 per month in alimony, and her equitable share in the marital assets was $784,055.Â  Wife employed two attorneys from Columbia.Â  Her attorneys charged $400 per hour for their work, $200 per hour for associates, and $100 per hour for paralegal work.Â  Her two expert witnesses, Hobbs, the CPA, and Linhardt, the appraiser, charged $23,458.88 and $51,000, respectively, for their work in assessing and valuing the marital estate.Â  \r\nWife argues the family court abused its discretion by not giving sufficient consideration to Husbandâ€™s material misrepresentations, non-disclosure of income, and undervaluation of marital assets.Â  The court made numerous findings regarding Husbandâ€™s intentional non-disclosure of information and misrepresentations, including: \r\n\r\n  [Husbandâ€™s] Financial Declaration is not an accurate reflection of his spendable income . . . .Â  It is now clear to the [c]ourt that the Husbandâ€™s income and assets greatly exceed that which has been reported on his Financial Declarations. . . . I find that [Husband] has obfuscated his true income and assets . . . . [Husband] testified he purchased property with cash so that sellers could avoid taxation. . . . Based upon the swapping of money and property between Defendants Simpson Sr. and Simpson Jr., the discovery process has been significantly extended and confusion has reigned supreme. . . . I find as a fact that the credibility of the Defendants Simpson Jr. and Simpson Sr. are subject to significant question. . . . The demeanor of [Husband] while testifying before this [c]ourt and his own admissions as to some of his financial transactions raise questions in the [c]ourtâ€™s mind as to how open and honest he has been with [Wife] and the [c]ourt regarding his economic transactions. . . .\r\n\r\nThe record supports the family courtâ€™s conclusions that Husbandâ€™s behavior unnecessarily complicated this case.Â  It is important to remember when analyzing attorneyâ€™s fees that this Court does not sit to relieve self-inflicted wounds.Â  Rish v. Rish by and Through Barry, 296 S.C. 14, 17, 370 S.E.2d 102, 104 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  Likewise, this Court looks unfavorably on cases, such as this one, where a party withholds information that is necessary for the proper adjudication of the matters under consideration.Â  Skipper v. Skipper, 278 S.C. 104, 106, 292 S.E.2d 596, 598 (1982).Â  Husbandâ€™s lack of cooperation in discovery forced Wifeâ€™s attorneys to obtain relevant information through other more difficult means.Â  See Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 372 S.E.2d 107 (Ct. App. 1988) (Because Husbandâ€™s behavior caused Wife to incur additional expenses in the form of attorneyâ€™s fees at trial and on appeal, those expenses should be included in the family courtâ€™s determination of attorneyâ€™s fees on remand.).\r\nIn E.D.M. v. T.A.M., the South Carolina Supreme Court delineated the four factors used to determine whether attorneyâ€™s fees are warranted in a given case:\r\n\r\n  (1) the partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fee;\r\n  (2) beneficial results obtained by the attorney;\r\n  (3) the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions;\r\n  (4) the effect of the attorneyâ€™s fee on each partiesâ€™ standard of living.\r\n\r\n307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  Additionally, in Glasscock v. Glasscock, the South Carolina Supreme Court clarified the six factors used to determine a reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee:\r\n\r\n  (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case;\r\n  (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case;\r\n  (3) professional standing of counsel;\r\n  (4) contingency of compensation;\r\n  (5) beneficial results obtained;\r\n  (6) customary legal fees for similar services.\r\n\r\n304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).Â  \r\nIn the present case, we find the family court properly identified and applied the Glasscock factors until it considered the last factor, â€œthe customary legal fees for similar servicesâ€ factor.Â  The family courtâ€™s order reads â€œBased on the testimony of Ray E. Chandler, W.C. Coffey, Jr., and experience, I find that customary fees for similar work in this area is $185-$250 per hour.Â  Hourly fees that exceed this amount in this area are unusual rather than customary.â€Â  This conclusion is not supported by the record.Â  Ray Chandler, Husbandâ€™s former attorney, testified as follows:\r\n\r\n  Q:Â Â Â Â Â  Ray, you say youâ€™ve been practicing law for twenty-seven years?\r\n  A:Â Â Â Â Â  Iâ€™ve been practicing law for thirty-three years.Â  Iâ€™ve been practicing domestic law until last year when I have it up.Â  Twenty-seven, twenty-eight years.\r\n  Q:Â Â Â Â Â  What were your rates when you gave up the good domestic practice per hour?\r\n  A:Â Â Â Â Â  About two hundred and fifty dollars an hour in this county.\r\n  Q:Â Â Â Â Â  What is your observation of the average rates of domestic fees in Clarendon, Lee, Williamsburg, in the Third Circuit, Sumter County?\r\n  A:Â Â Â Â Â  I think the numbers that I see run between a hundred and sixty, seventy-five, eighty-five dollars.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler did not testify as to the customary fees for a complex case such as this one.Â  W.C. Coffey never testified about rates whatsoever.Â  Instead, his testimony concerned the common practice of father-son farmer teams setting up LLCâ€™s in which to hold their land and equipment.Â  \r\nOn the other hand, the family court was presented with affidavits from Wifeâ€™s attorneys as well as attorneys Lon Shull III and Mark Taylor, all of whom testified that $400 per hour is a reasonable and customary rate in Clarendon County for family law experts who try complicated cases like the one at bar.Â  Our Supreme Court has approved the practice of considering attorneysâ€™ resumes or professional standing as well as attorneysâ€™ affidavits when deciding appropriate attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Baron Data Sys., Inc. v. Loter, 297 S.C. 382, 385, 377 S.E.2d 296, 297 (1989).Â  Additionally, the court may consider whether the case was contested in good faith, whether the proof was simple or complicated because of the extent that material facts were disputed, and whether trial preparation by the attorneys required unusual skill, effort, or investment of time.Â  Prevatte v. Asbury Arms, 302 S.C. 413, 417, 396 S.C. 642, 644 (1990).\r\nThe record shows this was not an average case; rather it was a quite complex case which required unusual skill, effort, and time.Â  The family court was presented with testimony of four lawyers concerning customary fees for similar services in a complex case. Â However, the court relied on testimony of Husbandâ€™s former attorney who testified regarding average rates for a domestic case.Â  This was error.Â  Â Â \r\nNumerous cases in South Carolina list attorneyâ€™s fees charged in the locality for similar services as a factor to be considered in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  See e.g., Blumberg v. Nealco Inc., 310 S.C. 492, 494, 427 S.E.2d 659, 660 (1993) (emphasis added); Meene v. Keowee Key Prop. Owners Assâ€™n Inc., 368 S.C. 557, 569, 629 S.E.2d 690, 697 (Ct. App. 2006); Rowell v. Whisnant, 360 S.C. 181, 185-86, 600S.E.2d 96, 99 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Therefore, we cannot assign error to the family courtâ€™s consideration of the local geographic area in determining the proper attorneyâ€™s fees. \r\nAccordingly, the portion of the family courtâ€™s order regarding attorneyâ€™s fees and costs is reversed and remanded for the family court to properly assess the facts of the case and the Glasscock factors in accordance with our decision. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated above, the family courtâ€™s order is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.[6]\r\nANDERSON, and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Wife named Simpson, Jr. as a defendant because he is a member of the LLC.\r\n[2] This issue was not raised in Husbandâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion and would not have been preserved even if the motion had gone forward.Â  \r\n[3] We also note that Simpson, Jr.â€™s tax return and his accumulation of assets cannot be reconciled.Â  For example, in 2001 he purchased $14,000 worth of real estate and his tax return showed an income of $17,000.Â  Despite a tax return never showing an income greater than $26,000, in 2003, Simpson, Jr. owned $150,000 worth of farm equipment.Â  \r\n[4] This issue was not raised in Husbandâ€™s motion for reconsideration.Â  \r\n[5] Husband did raise this issue in the Rule 59(e) motion, which the family court dismissed.Â  \r\n[6] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-148","title":"McGee v.

Vance Stricklin, Jr. and Katherine Carruth Link, of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this family law action, Monica McGee (Wife) appeals the family courtâ€™s order awarding her lump sum alimony of $250 per month for three years.Â  Wife claims lump sum alimony was not an appropriate type of alimony.Â  Further, she argues the actual amount of alimony was inadequate.Â  We affirm as modified. \r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nWife and James McGee (Husband) married on April 5, 1988, and had two children: Chelsea, born in 1991, and Alex, born in 1995.Â  In April of 2003, on the evening of their fifteenth anniversary, Husband informed Wife that he did not love her anymore.Â  However, Husband did not move out of the house until July 11, 2003.Â  \r\nAfter moving out, Husband bought a condominium.Â  Kelly Gregory moved into Husbandâ€™s condominium following her separation from her husband.Â  Kelly and her husband had been neighbors and friends with both Husband and Wife, and their children were friends.Â  Kelly told her husband that she was living in Husbandâ€™s condominium as a roommate only.Â  \r\nOn July 29, 2003, Husband filed for a decree of separate support and maintenance.Â  On September 3, 2003, Wife filed an answer and counterclaim.Â  On June 14, 2004, Wife filed an amended answer and counterclaim requesting a divorce on the ground of adultery.Â  Husband amended his pleadings to seek a divorce on the ground of one-yearâ€™s continuous separation.Â  \r\nOn November 30, 2004, the family court conducted a hearing.Â  Several witnesses testified that both Husband and Wife drank practically every night.Â  Husbandâ€™s witnesses testified that Wife drank as much or more than Husband.Â  Witnesses also testified to incidents where Wife displayed excessive anger.Â  David Gregory, Kellyâ€™s ex-husband, testified that after Wife learned about Kelly moving in with Husband, he found a computer monitor Wife borrowed from him broken in a field beside her house as well as some ski equipment he left at her house for a combined yard sale.Â  Another neighbor, Wolfgang Scheider, testified that he witnessed Wife pounding on the window of Husbandâ€™s truck and screaming at him.Â  Husband testified that in August 2003, Wife took some possessions he received from his deceased parents as well as his personal belongings and threw them out in the driveway. Â \r\nVicki Brunson mentored the McGeesâ€™ and the Gregorysâ€™ children.Â  Brunson testified that Husband told her how he would sneak out of the house when Wife was asleep to see Kelly.Â  Brunson further testified that Husband first disclosed to her that he was having a relationship with Kelly in January or February 2003. Â \r\nIn July 2001, Wife began work as a paralegal at Nelson Mullins Riley and Scarborough.Â  Wife earned in excess of $50,000 per year and received excellent performance reviews.Â  Following the separation, Wife experienced emotional problems stemming from the separation.Â  Consequently, Wifeâ€™s performance at work declined, and she was fired in September 2004.Â  Husband and Wife stipulated to a yearly income of $40,000 for Wife.Â  At the time of trial, Wife was drawing unemployment and searching for a job as a paralegal at Columbia law firms.[1]Â  \r\nHusband works for South Carolina Electric and Gas.Â  He is paid an hourly rate of $28.37 and is guaranteed two hundred hours of overtime each year at the rate of $44 per hour.Â  Husband can request more overtime hours but is not guaranteed to receive them.Â  He also testified he earned more overtime in 2004 than he earned in the past due to additional training required for work.Â  His income in recent years was: $34,000 in 1999; $55,000 in 2000; $56,000 in 2001; $62,000 in 2002; and $70,846.24 in 2003.Â  Husband testified that he expected to earn between $70,000 and $75,000 in 2005.Â  \r\nOn February 7, 2005, the family court issued an order granting the parties a divorce on the ground of adultery.Â  The parties previously entered into a settlement agreement for custody and visitation as well as the division of real and personal property.Â  Under the agreement, Wife received custody of the children, and Husband received reasonable and liberal visitation.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Wife received: (1) the marital residence; (2) her 401(k) Retirement Plan; (3) her individual retirement account; and (4) the 1995 Ford Crown Victoria.Â  Husband received: (1) his SCANA stock retirement plan; (2) his 2001 Ford F150 truck; and (3) the joint savings account at the Utilities Employees Credit Union.Â  Further, each party retained ownership of the personal property in his or her possession and any checking, savings, or other accounts in his or her name.Â  Additionally, Husband was to pay Wife $2000 in two equal installments as part of the agreement regarding property division.Â  \r\nThe family court found Husband engaged in an open and adulterous affair with a woman who was a friend of the couple, and Husbandâ€™s actions were the primary cause of the breakup of the marriage. Â Further, the family court found Wife lost her job partially due to the grief caused by Husbandâ€™s affair, which led to the breakup of the marriage. Â \r\nThe family court awarded Wife alimony of $250 per month for twenty-four months without specifying the type of alimony awarded.Â  The family court considered factors including: (1) the lifestyle of the parties during the marriage; (2) Wifeâ€™s need for financial assistance, particularly in regards to the residence where the children lived; and (3) the ability of Husband to pay.Â  The family court also ordered Husband to pay child support of $995 per month.Â  The court took several factors into account, including: (1) the fault and demise of the marriage; (2) the relative assets, resources, and income of the parties; (3) the independent assets of Husband; and (4) the results obtained by Wifeâ€™s counsel. Â Ultimately, the family court ordered Husband to pay Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees in the amount of $4000. \r\nBoth Husband and Wife filed Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motions for reconsideration.Â  Husband requested the family court include sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law to support the alimony award and suggested the family court identify the alimony as lump sum alimony.Â  Husband also argued that the amount of child support awarded was incorrect and should have been $897 per month.Â  Further, Husband argued Wife should not have received attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Husband argued alternatively, Wife should have received less attorneyâ€™s fees and that the current attorneyâ€™s fees should have been distributed over more than three payments.Â  Husband also requested the order include language indicating that Wife testified she was ultimately responsible for the conduct leading to her loss of employment.Â  Wifeâ€™s arguments in her motion for reconsideration included: (1) the award of alimony should be increased; (2) the divorce decree should specify if the alimony is lump sum or rehabilitative and include grounds to justify the award for twenty-four months; and (3) the time period for payment of alimony should be enlarged.Â  \r\nOn August 11, 2005, the family court issued an amended decree of divorce.Â  The amended decree included more detailed findings of fact.Â  Some of those additional findings included: (1) Husband testified that his adultery occurred after the breakup of the marriage and was not the primary cause of the breakup of the marriage; (2) testimony of both parties indicated that communication in the marriage had been strained for a long time; (3) both parties testified their lifestyle included the frequent use of alcohol; (4) Husbandâ€™s witnesses testified as to Wifeâ€™s excessive use of alcohol and her temper and spiteful conduct; and (5) Wife â€œspecifically testified she was ultimately responsible for the conduct which led to the loss of her employment.â€Â  Thereafter the family court revised the child support award to $897 per month.Â  \r\nIn regards to alimony, the family court found â€œ[l]ump sum alimony is appropriate based on the special and exceptional circumstances which exist in this case.Â  Specifically, [Wife] was employed with a prestigious law firm earning in excess of $50,000 and lost this employment based in part on her conduct.â€Â  The family court elaborated and found lump sum alimony was appropriate: (1) because Wife requested â€œany form of spousal support or maintenanceâ€; (2) because the award was intended to bridge Wifeâ€™s standard of living following her period of unemployment until her expected return to the work force; (3) to achieve equity based upon the length of the marriage, the relatively young age of the parties, and their respective abilities to earn income and be free of the need of support from the other; and (4) because permanent periodic alimony would undermine the ability for either party to gain closure to this situation, and would serve as a disincentive for Wife to move forward with her life by remarrying or increasing her earning potential, due to Wifeâ€™s desire to punish Husband.Â  The family court modified the alimony to last for thirty-six months in the same monthly amount of $250.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nâ€œOn appeal from a family court order, this Court has authority to correct errors of law and find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 473, 415 S.E.2d 812, 814 (1992).Â  When reviewing decisions of the family court, we are cognizant of the fact that it had the opportunity to see the witnesses, hear â€œthe testimony delivered from the stand, and had the benefit of that personal observance of and contact with the parties which is of peculiar value in arriving at a correct result in a case of this character.â€Â  DuBose v. DuBose, 259 S.C. 418, 423, 192 S.E.2d 329, 331 (1972); see also Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003) (â€œBecause the family court is in a superior position to judge the witnessesâ€™ demeanor and veracity, its findings should be given broad discretion.â€). When the evidence is conflicting and susceptible of different inferences, the family court has the duty of determining not only the law of the case, but the facts as well, because it had the benefit of observing the witnesses and determining how much credence to give each witnessâ€™s testimony.Â  Anders v. Anders, 285 S.C. 512, 514, 331 S.E.2d 340, 341 (1985); see also Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996) (holding when evidence is disputed, the appellate court may adhere to the family courtâ€™s findings).Â  \r\nThe amount to be awarded for alimony, as well as a determination of whether the spouse is entitled to alimony, is within the sound discretion of the family court.Â  Smith v. Smith, 264 S.C. 624, 628, 216 S.E.2d 541, 543 (1975); see also Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 529, 599 S.E.2d 114, 121 (2004) (â€œThe amount of alimony is within the [family] courtâ€™s sound discretion and should not be disturbed on appeal unless an abuse of discretion is shown.â€).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the decision is controlled by an error of law or is based on factual findings that are without evidentiary support.Â  Degenhart v. Burriss, 360 S.C. 497, 500, 602 S.E.2d 96, 97 (Ct. App. 2004). Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWife argues the family court erred in awarding lump sum alimony rather than permanent periodic or rehabilitative alimony.Â  Additionally, Wife contends the amount of the award was inadequate in light of Husbandâ€™s ability to pay and Wifeâ€™s need for an adequate standard of living.Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nThe purpose of alimony is to place the supported spouse, as close as is practical, in the same position of support as during the marriage.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988). Â If the claim for alimony is well-founded, the family court has the duty of making â€œan alimony award that is fit, equitable, and just.â€Â  Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 184, 554 S.E.2d 421, 424 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The family court should consider the following factors in awarding alimony: \r\n\r\n  (1) duration of the marriage; (2) physical and emotional health of the parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4) employment history and earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living established during the marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the parties; (7) current and reasonably anticipated expenses of the parties; (8) marital and nonmarital properties of the parties; (9) custody of children; (10) marital misconduct or fault; (11) tax consequences; and (12) prior support obligations; as well as (13) other factors the court considers relevant.\r\n\r\nId. at 184, 554 S.E.2d at 424.Â  \r\nSection 20-3-130(B) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) provides, \r\n\r\n  Alimony and separate maintenance and support awards may be granted pendente lite and permanently in such amounts and for periods of time subject to conditions as the court considers just including, but not limited to: \r\n  \r\n    (1) periodic alimony . . . . \r\n    (2) lump sum alimony . . . .\r\n    (3) rehabilitative alimony . . . .\r\n    (4) reimbursement alimony . . . .\r\n    (5) separate maintenance and support . . . .\r\n    (6) [s]uch other form of spousal support, under terms and conditions as the court may consider just, as appropriate under the circumstances without limitation to grant more than one form of support.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court has held â€œ[t]hree important factors in awarding periodic alimony are (1) the duration of the marriage; (2) the overall financial situation of the parties, especially the ability of the supporting spouse to pay; and (3) whether either spouse was more at fault than the other.â€Â  Patel, 359 S.C. at 529, 599 S.E.2d at 121.Â  \r\nSection 20-3-130(B)(2) describes lump sum alimony as â€œa finite total sum to be paid in one installment, or periodically over a period of time, terminating only upon the death of the supported spouse, but not terminable or modifiable based upon remarriage or changed circumstances in the future.â€ Â The statute further provides the purpose of lump sum alimony may include, but is not limited to, circumstances in which the family court finds alimony appropriate but determines that the award should be finite and nonmodifiable.Â  Id. \r\nThe family court should consider the following factors in determining whether to award lump sum alimony: \r\n\r\n  (1) the financial condition or status of the appellant; (2) the needs of the respondent; (3) the health and ages of both parties; (4) each partyâ€™s earning capacity; (5) the actual income of each party; (6) the individual contributions to the accumulation of their joint wealth; (7) the standard of living by both parties at the time of the divorce; (8) the duration of the marriage; (9) the conduct of the parties; and (10) the special circumstances making any award of lump sum alimony advisable. \r\n\r\n\r\n    Atkinson v. Atkinson, 279 S.C. 454, 456-57, 309 S.E.2d 14, 15 (Ct. App. 1983).\r\nTypically, the primary justification for lump sum alimony is the unreliability of the supporting spouse to make regular payments.Â  See Jones v. Jones, 270 S.C. 280, 241 S.E.2d 904 (1978) (upholding the award of $36,000 in lump sum alimony when husband drank excessively, was not regularly employed, had failed to pay child support for the last five years, threatened to leave the country to avoid payments, and had just inherited property valued near $100,000); Murdock v. Murdock,243 S.C. 218, 133 S.E.2d 323 (1963) (affirming lump sum alimony of $4250 when the husband moved to a distant state, remarried, and had been found in contempt of court for failing to pay pendente lite alimony); Hendricks v. Hendricks,285 S.C. 591, 330 S.E.2d 553 (Ct. App. 1985) (affirming lump sum alimony of $30,000 when husband failed to support his family for nineteen years, quickly spent a $45,000 inheritance by purchasing a truck and paying the hospital bills of a paramour in another state); see also Roy T. Stuckey, Marital Litigation in South Carolina 217 (3d ed. 2001). \r\nThe circumstances in the present case do not justify lump sum alimony.Â  Husbandâ€™s employment and income is reliable, he currently resides in the area, and he has not failed to make any support payments.Â  Accordingly, the family court erred in labeling the award lump sum alimony.\r\nPursuant to Section 20-3-130(B)(3) rehabilitative alimony is: \r\n\r\n  a finite sum to be paid in one installment or periodically, terminable upon the remarriage or continued cohabitation of the supported spouse, the death of either spouse . . . or the occurrence of a specific event to occur in the future, or modifiable based upon unforeseen events frustrating the good faith efforts of the supported spouse to become self-supporting or the ability of the supporting spouse to pay the rehabilitative alimony.Â  \r\n\r\nThe purpose of rehabilitative alimony may include, but is not limited to, circumstances when the family court finds providing for the rehabilitation of the supported spouse appropriate.Â  Rehabilitative alimony provides modifiable ending dates coinciding with events considered appropriate by the family court such as the completion of job training or education and the like and requires rehabilitative efforts by the supported spouse.Â  Id.; see also Eagerton v. Eagerton, 285 S.C. 279, 282, 328 S.E.2d 912, 914 (Ct. App. 1985) (â€œThe purpose of rehabilitative alimony is to encourage a dependent spouse to become self-supporting by providing alimony for a limited period of time during which the dependent spouse might retrain and rehabilitate himself or herself thereby limiting the duration of the time in which the supporting spouse is burdened by spousal support.â€). Â Moreover, rehabilitative alimony permits a couple to develop their own lives free from obligations to each other. Â Id. at 282, 328 S.E.2d at 914-15.\r\nThe factors to be considered in awarding rehabilitative alimony include: \r\n\r\n  (1) the duration of the marriage; (2) the age, health, and education of the supported spouse; (3) the financial resources of the parties; (4) the partiesâ€™ accustomed standard of living; (5) the ability of the supporting spouse to meet his needs while meeting those of the supported spouse; (6) the time necessary for the supported spouse to acquire job training or skills; (7) the likelihood that the supported spouse will successfully complete retraining; and (8) the supported spouseâ€™s likelihood of success in the job market. \r\n\r\nJohnson, at 301-02, 372 S.E.2d at 114.Â  In order for the family court to grant rehabilitative alimony, the evidence must demonstrate the supported spouse will be self-sufficient at the expiration of the ordered payments. Â Toler v. Toler, 292 S.C. 374, 378, 356 S.E.2d 429, 431 (Ct. App. 1987).\r\nWhile it may be true that Wife needed time to recover from the divorce, she already possesses the necessary skills to be successful in the job market.Â  Thus, the facts of this case do not fit squarely within the parameters of a typical rehabilitative alimony case.Â  \r\nFurthermore, Wifeâ€™s counsel acknowledged at oral argument the facts of this case do not clearly call for permanent periodic alimony.Â  Although lump sum, rehabilitative, and permanent periodic alimony do not fit the facts of this case, we find ample support in the record for alimony under Section 20-3-130(B)(6), which authorizes the award of â€œ[s]uch other form of spousal support, under terms and conditions as the court may consider just, as appropriate under the circumstances.â€\r\nThis court may affirm the family court on any ground appearing in the record. See Rule 220(c), SCRAC (â€œThe appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, decision or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.â€).Â  Accordingly, we affirm the family courtâ€™s award of alimony under section 20-3-130(B)(6).Â  See C.A.H. v. L.H., 315 S.C. 389, 434 S.E.2d 268 (1993) (although rehabilitative alimony was not proper under the circumstances, the court found ample support in the record for alimony under Section 20-3-130(B)(6)).Â  This form of alimony is beneficial in the present case because it allows the parties to develop lives separate from each other, which is necessary due to Wifeâ€™s anger towards Husband.Â  While Wife did not need â€œretraining,â€ she needed additional time to reenter the workforce and reach the salary range she attained before losing her job.Â  Although Wife lost her job due to her behavior, that behavior occurred partly as a result of the emotional distress caused when Husband moved out after fifteen years of marriage and subsequently began living with Wifeâ€™s friend.Â  We give the family court discretion in deciding whether to award alimony, and based on the circumstances in this case, the family courtâ€™s decision was not an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\nThe family court awarded Wife $250 per month for 36 months.Â  This court recognizes the partiesâ€™ current and reasonably anticipated earnings and expenses as well as the fact that husband has enough disposable income to offset some of the marital debt assigned to Wife in the distribution of marital property.Â  In light of the overall circumstances of this case and Wifeâ€™s monthly expenses coupled with Husbandâ€™s monthly disposable income, we hereby modify Wifeâ€™s alimony award to $500 per month for 36 months.\r\nAccordingly, the family courtâ€™s order is \r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nHUFF, BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] On May 9, 2005, at the hearing on the motion for reconsideration, Husbandâ€™s attorney maintained that Wife had secured a job.Â  The record does not contain any evidence of what the job was or what Wifeâ€™s salary was.Â  At oral argument the parties confirmed that Wife is now working as a paralegal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-149","title":"State v.

Cooper, Special Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-150\r\nSubmitted April 2, 2007 â€“ Filed April 4, 2007Â Â Â \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAppellate Defender Eleanor Duffy Cleary, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nBen Aplin, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In 1995, appellant was sentenced under the Youthful Offender Act (YOA) to an indeterminate term of imprisonment not to exceed six years for grand larceny.Â  At the same time, appellant was also sentenced to concurrent terms of fifteen years imprisonment, suspended upon the service of five years probation, for ten counts of second degree burglary.Â  The probationary period was to commence after appellant served his YOA sentence.Â  Before the probationary period commenced, however, appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder.Â  Because appellantâ€™s commission of the offense of murder prevented him from complying with the conditions of his probation for second degree burglary, the State sought and received a revocation of his probation.Â  \r\nAlthough appellant does not argue on appeal the precise issue he presented in the trial court, the essence of his position is that he did not â€œwillfullyâ€ violate the conditions of his probation because he was incarcerated for murder.Â  Appellant argues, for example, he did not â€œwillfullyâ€ fail to report in person to the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services, which was a condition of his probation, because his incarceration for murder prevented him from doing so.Â  Appellantâ€™s position, even if preserved, is transparently specious.Â  We affirm[1] pursuant to Rule 220(b)(2), SCACR, and the following authorities:Â  State v. McCray, 332 S.C. 536, 542, 506 S.E.2d 301, 303 (1998) (noting a party cannot argue one ground at trial and another on appeal); State v. Lee, 350 S.C. 125, 130, 564 S.E.2d 372, 375 (Ct.

Barnhill, Jr. and Zoe Sanders Nettles, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Lamar\r\n  Florida, Inc. appeals the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment against\r\n  Lamarâ€™s claim that Liâ€™l Cricket, L.L.C. trespassed on its real property by\r\n  removing Lamarâ€™s billboard from property leased to Lamar but owned by Liâ€™l\r\n  Cricket.Â  Lamar argues its failure to pay rent did not deprive Lamar of\r\n  exclusive possession of the land and its failure to record the lease did not\r\n  prevent Liâ€™l Cricket from having notice of Lamarâ€™s interest.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nI.\r\nOn\r\n  September 29, 1995, Alvin Miller leased property in Columbia (â€œthe propertyâ€)\r\n  to Outdoor East, predecessor in interest to Lamar, for a period of 5 years for\r\n  $700 per year.Â  The property was the size necessary to support a billboard, and\r\n  the lease was entered for the purpose of construction and maintenance of a\r\n  billboard by Outdoor East.Â  The lease\r\n  agreement does not contain a provision regarding failure to pay rent.Â  As admitted by Lamar, the lease was never\r\n  recorded.Â  \r\nOn December 11, 1996, Lamar purchased the billboard and the lease\r\n  interest in the property from Outdoor East.Â  In early 1997, Lamar placed\r\n  nameplates on the billboard.Â  Alvin Miller sold the property to John Miller.Â \r\n  On November 21, 1997, Liâ€™l Cricket purchased the property from John Miller.Â  \r\nLamar never paid rent to Liâ€™l Cricket for the property.Â  In a\r\n  letter sent via fax to Lamarâ€™s attorney on or about August 19, 1999, Liâ€™l\r\n  Cricket instructed Lamar to remove the billboard.Â  Liâ€™l Cricket sent another\r\n  letter to Lamar dated August 24, 1999 insisting Lamar remove the billboard by\r\n  August 31, 1999.Â  On or about August 24, 1999, the Jones Sign Company attempted\r\n  to remove the billboard per Liâ€™l Cricketâ€™s request.Â  Lamar prevented the Jones\r\n  Sign Company from fully removing the billboard.Â  In a letter dated August 26, 1999,\r\n  Lamar responded to Liâ€™l Cricketâ€™s action and argued it had a valid lease.Â \r\n  Lamar attached the lease to the letter.Â  Lamar also sent two letters dated\r\n  September 1, 1999 and September 3, 1999 stating Lamar has a valid lease and Columbia regulations allow Liâ€™l Cricket to erect its own sign without removing Lamarâ€™s\r\n  billboard.Â  \r\nIn a letter dated September 3, 1999, Liâ€™l Cricket provided second\r\n  notice to Lamar that the billboard must be removed immediately.Â  On or about\r\n  October 1, 1999, Liâ€™l Cricket wrote the Jones Sign Company instructing them to\r\n  take down the billboard.Â  The Jones Sign Company took down the billboard. \r\nLamar brought suit against Liâ€™l Cricket claiming breach of\r\n  contract, conversion, and a violation of the Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA).\r\n  Â The trial court granted summary judgment on the claims for conversion and a\r\n  violation of UTPA, which was affirmed by this court and Lamarâ€™s petition for\r\n  certiorari was denied on September 9, 2004.[2]Â Â  \r\nLamar moved to amend its complaint to include claims against Liâ€™l\r\n  Cricket for trespass to real property and trespass to personal property.Â  The\r\n  trial court first denied Lamarâ€™s motion, but the trial court later granted\r\n  Lamarâ€™s motion to alter or amend, thereby allowing Lamar to amend its complaint\r\n  to include claims for trespass to real and personal property.Â  Subsequently,\r\n  the trial court granted Liâ€™l Cricketâ€™s motion for summary judgment regarding\r\n  Lamarâ€™s claim for trespass to real property.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nII.\r\nâ€œAn\r\n  appellate court reviews the grant of summary judgment under the same standard\r\n  applied by the trial court.â€Â  Houck v. State Farm\r\n    Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 366 S.C. 7, 11, 620 S.E.2d 326, 329&nbsp;(2005).Â  Summary judgment is only appropriate when clearly no\r\n  genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to\r\n  judgment as a matter of law. Â Rule 56(c),\r\n  SCRCP; Cafe Assocs., Ltd. v. Gerngross, 305 S.C. 6, 9, 406 S.E.2d 162,\r\n  164&nbsp;(1991).Â  However, summary judgment is not\r\n  appropriate if further inquiry into the caseâ€™s facts is desirable for the\r\n  application of the law.Â  Brockbank v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 378, 534\r\n    S.E.2d 688, 692 (2000).Â  Conversely, â€œwhen plain, palpable, and\r\n  indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ, summary\r\n  judgment should be granted.â€Â  Hedgepath v.\r\n    Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 348 S.C. 340, 355, 559 S.E.2d\r\n  327, 336 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nIII.\r\nA.&nbsp;Trespass\r\nLamar\r\n  argues the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to Liâ€™l Cricket on\r\n  Lamarâ€™s claim for trespass to real property after the trial court found Lamarâ€™s\r\n  claim lacked two key elements: Liâ€™l Cricketâ€™s intentional invasion and Lamarâ€™s\r\n  exclusive possession.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œ[T]respass\r\n  is any intentional invasion of the plaintiffâ€™s interest in the exclusive\r\n  possession of his property . . . .â€Â  Hawkins v. City of Greenville, 358\r\n  S.C. 280, 296, 594 S.E.2d 557, 565&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004) (quoting Hedgepath v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 348 S.C. 340, 356, 559 S.E.2d 327, 337 (Ct. App.\r\n  2001)).Â  The trial court held summary judgment for\r\n  trespass to real property was appropriate because the unrecorded lease provided\r\n  no notice preventing Liâ€™l Cricket from intentionally invading the property and\r\n  Lamarâ€™s failure to pay rent prohibited Lamar from having exclusive possession\r\n  of the property.Â  \r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Intentional Invasion\r\nLamar\r\n  contends the trial court erred by holding Liâ€™l Cricket did not intentionally\r\n  invade Lamarâ€™s interest because Liâ€™l Cricket lacked notice of the lease\r\n  agreement between Outdoor East and Miller, Lamar and Liâ€™l Cricketâ€™s\r\n  predecessors of title.Â  We disagree. \r\nSection\r\n  30-7-10 of the South Carolina Code (2007) requires leases for more than twelve\r\n  months to be recorded in order to affect the rights of subsequent purchasers\r\n  without notice.Â  Additionally, section 30-7-90 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (2007) provides:\r\n\r\n  No\r\n    possession of real property described in any instrument of writing required by\r\n    law to be recorded shall operate as notice of such instrument. Actual notice\r\n    shall be deemed and held sufficient to supply the place of registration only\r\n    when such notice is of the instrument itself or of its nature and purport.\r\n\r\nThe lease,\r\n  originally between Outdoor East and Miller, was for five years.Â  Lamar admits\r\n  the lease was never recorded.Â  Further, possession of the property and Lamarâ€™s\r\n  use of name plates on the billboard did not qualify as actual notice under\r\n  section 30-7-90.Â  Thus, Liâ€™l Cricket did not have notice of Lamarâ€™s interest\r\n  and accordingly, Liâ€™l Cricket could not intentionally invade Lamarâ€™s interest.Â  \r\n2. Exclusive Possession\r\nLamar\r\n  argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Liâ€™l Cricket for\r\n  Lamarâ€™s claim of trespass to real property because Lamar lacked exclusive\r\n  possession of the property.Â  We disagree.\r\nExclusive\r\n  possession is defined as â€œthe exercise of exclusive dominion over property,\r\n  including the use and benefit of the property.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1184 (7th ed. 1999).Â  Section 27-35-140 of the South Carolina Code (2007)\r\n  states, â€œ[f]ailure to pay the rent agreed upon when due, or a reasonable\r\n  rent for use and occupation when demanded, shall terminate all tenancies for a\r\n  term, for years, from month to month and at will and the tenant shall forthwith\r\n  vacate the premises without notice.â€Â  We know of no reason, and Appellant cites\r\n  none, why this statutory provision does not control the disposition of this\r\n  case, particularly because the lease is silent on the consequences of a failure\r\n  to pay rent. \r\nAppellant\r\n  points to Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, Inc., 312 S.C.\r\n  271, 440 S.E.2d 364 (1994), and Litchfield Co. of South Carolina, Inc. v.\r\n    Kiriakides, 290 S.C. 220, 349 S.E.2d 344 (Ct. App. 1986), to argue failure\r\n  to pay rent does not automatically result in the termination of a lease.Â  However, Kiriakides prevents forfeiture by landlords for trivial breaches.Â  312\r\n  S.C. at 275-76, 349 S.E.2d at 366.Â  This case is easily distinguishable because\r\n  the complete failure to pay rent under the circumstances presented is not a\r\n  trivial breach. Â Litchfield is also distinguishable.Â  In Litchfield,\r\n  the method of terminating the tenancy was clearly set forth by the lease.Â  290\r\n  S.C. at 225-26, 349 S.E.2d at 347-48.Â  In the case before us, as previously\r\n  noted, the lease does not contain a provision regarding the failure to pay\r\n  rent.\r\nThe lease agreement requires payment of $700 annually.Â  Lamar\r\n  admitted it did not make any rental payments to Liâ€™l Cricket.Â  Liâ€™l Cricket\r\n  purchased the property on November 21, 1997.Â  The billboard was taken down\r\n  around October 1, 1999.Â  Lamar argues only one rent payment was missed over the\r\n  time period.Â  The evidence provided at trial, however, shows Liâ€™l Cricket owned\r\n  the property for almost two years without receiving any payment from Lamar.Â \r\n  Therefore, Lamarâ€™s breach of the lease agreement was material as a matter of\r\n  law, and it surrendered its exclusive possession of the property.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  Liâ€™l Cricket did not trespass on Lamarâ€™s real property because Lamar did not\r\n  have exclusive possession of the property.\r\nB. Prior Opinion by Court of\r\n  Appeals\r\nLamar\r\n  argues the trial court erred in relying on an unpublished opinion of this court\r\n  related to additional causes of action brought by Lamar against Liâ€™l Cricket\r\n  arising from the same facts.Â  While there may be merit to this argument, we\r\n  find that any error was harmless because the trial courtâ€™s reliance on these\r\n  statements was inconsequential. \r\nâ€œAn\r\n  error not shown to be prejudicial does not constitute grounds for reversal.â€Â  Brown\r\n    v. Pearson, 326 S.C. 409, 417, 483 S.E.2d 477, 481&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997).Â \r\n  â€œAn error is not reversible unless it is material and prejudicial to the\r\n  substantial rights of the appellant.â€Â  Visual Graphics Leasing Corp., Inc.\r\n    v. Lucia, 311 S.C. 484, 489, 429 S.E.2d 839, 841&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  its order, the trial court stated:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    record reflects that Liâ€™l Cricket had neither actual notice of the instrument\r\n    itself nor of its nature and purport.Â  The Court of Appealâ€™s decision affirming\r\n    summary judgment as to conversion provided: â€œ[W]hen Liâ€™l Cricket purchased the\r\n    property, it lacked knowledge of the lease between Lamar and Al Miller.Â  At no\r\n    time did Liâ€™l Cricket receive rent for the sign.Â  Lamar Adver. of Mobile,\r\n      Inc. d/b/a Lamar Adver. of Columbia v. Liâ€™l Cricket LLC, Ct. App. Op.\r\n    2003-UP-483.Â  The Court of Appeals further stated [t]he lease was never\r\n    recorded.â€Â  Id.Â  Additionally, the deposition testimony of Al Miller,\r\n    the owner of the property from whom Liâ€™l Cricket purchased the property and the\r\n    person with whom Lamar had the alleged lease, shows Liâ€™l Cricket had no notice\r\n    of the lease when it purchased the property.\r\n\r\nThough the trial\r\n  court did reference this courtâ€™s prior unpublished opinion, the record\r\n  otherwise provides an ample basis to support the finding that Liâ€™l Cricket\r\n  lacked knowledge of the lease between Lamar and Al Miller.Â  Thus, any error was\r\n  harmless error.\r\nIV.\r\nThe\r\n  entry of summary judgment in favor of Liâ€™l Cricket is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON,\r\n  KITTREDGE, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n[2] See Lamar Adver. v.

Benjamin Aplin, of Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Danny Leland Floyd appeals the revocation of his probation.Â  He argues the proceeding against him was invalid because the probation agent who presented the stateâ€™s case at his probation revocation hearing was not an attorney and therefore engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn March 13, 2003 a grand jury indicted Danny Leland Floyd for receiving stolen goods and possession of crack cocaine.Â  Additionally, he was charged with possession of the Schedule IV drug â€œClonazepam,â€ possession of the Schedule IV drug â€œXanax,â€ and possession of marijuana.Â  On May 22, 2003 Floyd waived presentment to the grand jury on the Schedule IV drug and marijuana charges, pled guilty as charged, and was sentenced as follows: five years imprisonment suspended upon the service of three years imprisonment and three years probation for possession of crack cocaineâ€“2nd offence; five years consecutive imprisonment suspended upon the service of three years probation for receiving stolen goods over $1,000; one year concurrent imprisonment for possession of Schedule IV drug (Clonazepam)â€“3rd offense; one year concurrent imprisonment for possession of Schedule IV drug (Xanax)â€“3rd offense; one year concurrent imprisonment for possession of marijuanaâ€“3rd offense.\r\nOn November 1, 2004, Floyd satisfied his three year term of incarceration and began serving probation.Â  Four months later, on March 2, 2005, he was charged with violating the conditions of his probation in the following respects:\r\n\r\nFail to follow the advice and instructions of probation agent; Fail to report to probation office as directed, last reported on 11/16/04; Fail to refrain from the use of controlled substances by admitting on 11/16/04 to smoking marijuana laced with crack cocaine; fail to attend Narcotics Anonymous weekly as directed by agent; Fail to pay court ordered restitution, being in arrears $190.00 at time of warrant, Fail to pay court ordered surcharges; Fail to pay supervision fee, being in arrears $160.00 at the time of warrant.Â  Such actions constitute the violation of sections 1, 3, 7, 9, 10, 11 and Special Conditions.Â  \r\n\r\nFloydâ€™s probation agent, Wolfgang Rivas, issued and served a probation violation warrant in April 2005.Â  On August 29, 2005, Floyd appeared at his probation violation hearing, where he was represented by counsel.Â  Agent Rivas presented Floydâ€™s violations on behalf of the State.Â  Floyd conceded that he had violated the conditions of his probation.Â  The judge revoked his probation and ordered Floyd to serve the remainder of his five year prison sentence.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn appellate court will not disturb the circuit courtâ€™s decision to revoke probation unless the decision was influenced by an error of law, was without evidentiary support, or constituted an abuse of discretion. Â State v. Archie, 322 S.C. 135, 470 S.E.2d 380 (Ct. App. 1996); see also State v. White, 218 S.C. 130, 135, 61 S.E.2d 754 (1950) (stating that in reviewing the revocation of probation, the question is not one of formal procedure respecting either notice, specifications of charges or trial thereon, but is simply whether the trial court abused its discretion; review therefore must be determined in accordance with the principles governing exercise of judicial discretion). Â â€œThe decision to revoke probation is addressed to the discretion of the circuit judge.â€Â  State v. Lee, 350 S.C. 125, 129, 564 S.E.2d 372, 374 (Ct. App. 2002); accord White, 218 S.C. at 134-35, 61 S.E.2d at 756; State v. Proctor, 345 S.C. 299, 546 S.E.2d 673 (Ct. App. 2001); State v. Hamilton, 333 S.C. 642, 511 S.E.2d 94 (Ct. App. 1999). Â â€œA reviewing court will only reverse this determination when it is based on an error of law or a lack of supporting evidence renders it arbitrary or capricious.â€Â  Lee, 350 S.C. at 129, 564 S.E.2d at 374; accord Proctor, 345 S.C. at 301, 546 S.E.2d at 674. Â Our Supreme Court has instructed that the circuit court has expansive discretionary authority in dealing with guilty persons who are in a probationary status. Â Shannon v. Young, 272 S.C. 61, 248 S.E.2d 914 (1978).\r\nISSUE\r\nDoes the filing of a petition to revoke probation and the presentation of the Stateâ€™s case by a probation agent (a non-lawyer) in a probation violation hearing constitute the unauthorized practice of law?Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFloyd contends the circuit court erred by permitting a non-lawyer probation agent to present the Stateâ€™s case for revoking his probation because this appearance constitutes the unauthorized practice of law.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, we note this argument may not be preserved for appellate review, as it was neither raised before nor ruled upon by the probation revocation judge.Â  See State v. Hamilton, 333 S.C. 642, 648, 511 S.E.2d 94, 96 (Ct. App. 1999) (in order to be preserved for review, a challenge to the validity of a probation revocation must be raised to and ruled upon by the revocation judge).Â  At the probation revocation hearing, Floyd never challenged the propriety of the probation agent presenting the violations on behalf of the State and never complained that the agent was not a licensed attorney.Â  Instead, he simply admitted the charged probation violations and attempted to convince the court not to revoke his probation.Â  \r\nBecause of the multitudinous probation revocation hearings held in South Carolina on a daily basis, the issue posited by this appeal is germane and felicitous to the functional operation of the judicial system.Â  Adverting to the merits of the case, we address Floydâ€™s argument.\r\nThe South Carolina Constitution authorizes our Supreme Court to regulate the practice of law in this state.Â  S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 4; see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-5-10 (2001).Â  The Court has consistently refrained from adopting a specific rule to define the practice of law.Â  See In re Unauthorized Practice of Law Rules, 309 S.C. 304, 305, 422 S.E.2d 123, 124 (1992) (stating â€œit is neither practicable nor wiseâ€ to formulate a comprehensive definition of what the practice of law is). Instead, the definition of what constitutes the practice of law turns on the facts of each individual case.Â  Id.Â  â€œThe generally understood definition of the practice of law â€˜embraces the preparation of pleadings, and other papers incident to actions and special proceedings, and the management of such actions and proceedings on behalf of clients before judges and courts.â€™ â€ Â State v. Despain, 319 S.C. 317, 319, 460 S.E.2d 576, 577 (1995) (quoting In re Duncan, 83 S.C. 186, 189, 65 S.E. 210, 211 (1909)). Â Nonetheless, the practice of law â€œis not confined to litigation, but extends to activities in other fields which entail specialized legal knowledge and ability.â€ Â State v. Buyers Service Co., Inc., 292 S.C. 426, 430, 357 S.E.2d 15, 17 (1987). \r\nThe duties and powers of probation agents are set forth in the South Carolina Code:\r\n\r\nA probation agent must investigate all cases referred to him for investigation by the judges or director and report in writing. . . . He must keep informed concerning the conduct and condition of each person on probation, parole, or community supervision under his supervision by visiting, requiring reports, and in other ways, and must report in writing as often as the court or director may require. . . . A probation agent must keep detailed records of his work, make reports in writing, and perform other duties as the director may require. . . . In the performance of his duties of probation, parole, community supervision, and investigation, he is regarded as the official representative of the court, the department and the board.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-280 (2007).Â  \r\nDuring the period of probation, the court or the probation agent â€œmay issue or cause the issuing of a warrant and cause the defendant to be arrested for violating any of the conditions of probation or suspension of sentence.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-450 (2007).Â  The probation agent must report the arrest to the court and â€œsubmit in writing a report showing in what manner the probationer has violated his probation.â€Â  Id.Â  After the arrest, the court is required to bring the defendant before it to determine whether a violation occurred and if so, whether to revoke probation and require the defendant to serve all or a portion of the suspended sentence.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Ann Â§ 24-21-460 (2007).Â  \r\nIn Leverette v. State, 546 S.E.2d 63 (Ga. App. 2001), the Georgia Court of Appeals addressed a factual situation and argument analogous to the case sub judice.Â  In Leverette, the petitionerâ€™s probation was revoked for possession of cocaine.Â  In this case, the petition for revocation was signed and submitted to the court by a probation officer, a non-lawyer.Â  The defendant appealed, alleging the probation officer had participated in the unauthorized practice of law and therefore his revocation of probation was void ab initio.Â  The court disagreed.\r\nThe Leverette court noted the probation officer was a public official employed by the State who was assigned to handle the defendantâ€™s case:\r\n\r\n[W]e need not open the floodgates of litigation because Leveretteâ€™s argument ignores the fact that the probation officer is a public official employed by the State of Georgia and, in this instance, was assigned to handle Leveretteâ€™s case.Â  As such, the probation officer was acting as a State agent in the preparation and filing of the petition for revocation of Leveretteâ€™s probation.\r\n\r\nLeverette at 64 (internal footnotes omitted).Â  Therefore, the probation officer was acting as an agent for the State of Georgia, was a party to the action, and was not engaging in the unauthorized practice of law.Â  \r\n\r\nThe court noted the magnitude of a decision to the contrary:\r\n  \r\nAt the outset, it should be noted that the number of revocation petitions filed by probation officers in the State of Georgia are legion, and such practice has been ongoing for a lengthy period of time. Â If such petitions render the trial courtsâ€™ subsequent orders of revocation void, as argued by Leverette, then all such previous revocations-without time limitation-are subject to attack, since â€œ[t]he judgment of a court having no jurisdiction of the person or the subject matter or which is void for any other cause is a mere nullity and may be so held in any court when it becomes material to the interest of the parties to consider it.â€\r\n. . .\r\nIn acting as an agent for the State of Georgia assigned to handle matters relating to Leveretteâ€™s probation, [the probation officer] was a â€œpartyâ€ to the action, as contemplated under the statute. Â As such, [probation officerâ€™s] filing of a petition seeking a court hearing on the revocation of Leveretteâ€™s probation does not entail the unauthorized practice of law, such as when a layman represents another, unrelated â€œpersonâ€ in a legal capacity. Â Thus, contrary to Leveretteâ€™s contention, [the probation officer] was authorized to act on behalf of the State of Georgia in filling out the revocation petition.\r\n  \r\n\r\nLeverette at 64 (internal citations omitted).\r\nThe Georgia Court of Appeals upheld this decision in Strozier v. State, 546 S.E.2d 290 (Ga. App. 2001) and further expounded on the issue in Huzzie v. State, 558 S.E.2d 767 (Ga. App. 2002).Â  The cardinal difference between Huzzie and the previous two cases was that in Huzzie the probation officer was not a state employee, but was employed by a private corporation retained by the county to provide probation services in misdemeanor cases.Â  The defendant argued that an employee of a private company could not file probation revocation petitions because the non-attorney agent would be representing the corporation and not the State, thus engaging in the unauthorized practice of law.Â  \r\nSummarizing their earlier holding in Leverette, the court professed, â€œBecause a probation officer is charged with handling matters relating to probation, we concluded that such officer is essentially a party to the case and, thus, may file petitions in court relating to that case without violating the prohibition against the unauthorized practice of law.â€Â  Huzzie at 767 (internal citations omitted).Â  Reiteratively determining that the unauthorized practice had not occurred, the court stated:\r\n\r\nUnder [Georgia law], the chief judge of any court within the county is authorized â€œto enter into written contracts with corporations, enterprises, or agencies to provide probation supervision, counseling, or collection services in misdemeanor cases.â€Â  Once such contract has been entered, any probation officer-whether paid by the State or by a private corporation-is an officer of the court. Â As an officer of the court, the probation officerâ€™s primary duty is to represent the interest of justice, not the interests of his or her employer. Accordingly, Leverette still controls, notwithstanding the fact that Barnes was technically employed by a corporation, rather than the State.\r\n\r\nHuzzie at 768 (internal citations omitted).Â  \r\nRecognizing the defendantâ€™s appeal failed for other reasons, the court concluded:\r\n\r\n[A] person occupies a special status while on probation, during which time her private life and behavior may be regulated by the State to an extent that would be completely untenable under ordinary circumstances. Â The rationale for this power is basically, of course, that the person has been convicted of a crime and would be serving a sentence but for the grace of the court. She is a prima facie risk to society.\r\nTo lessen the risk to society, the law provides for the sentencing courtâ€™s continued jurisdiction over probationers. Â And, in maintaining such continued jurisdiction, the sentencing court is aided by probation officers, who serve as an investigative and supervisory arm of the court by actually monitoring probationers and providing required reports.\r\nThus, in filing a petition for probation revocation, Barnes was not instituting an action, which would constitute the practice of law. Â Rather, she was providing a report to the sentencing court, which already had jurisdiction over Huzzie by virtue of her criminal conviction. Â In so doing, Barnes neither held herself out as an attorney, nor furnished legal advice, nor undertook any other action that constitutes the unauthorized practice of law. Â Indeed, we are not the first Court to reach this conclusion. Â It follows that this claim of error presents no basis for reversal\r\n\r\nHuzzie at 768-69 (internal citations and quotations omitted).Â  \r\nThe Georgia Supreme Court upheld these decisions from the Georgia Court of Appeals in Wolcott v. State, 604 S.E.2d 479 (Ga. 2004):\r\n\r\nThe probation revocation petitions were filed by Valerie Clark, in her capacity as Wolcottâ€™s probation supervisor. Although Ms. Clark is not a licensed attorney, she was exercising the authority conferred on her by OCGA Â§ 42-8-29. Under that statute, she acted as a State agent in the preparation and filing of the petition[s] for revocation of [his] probationÂ·Â·Â·Â· In acting as an agent for the State of Georgia assigned to handle matters relating to [Wolcottâ€™s] probation, [Ms. Clark] was a â€œpartyâ€ to the action, as contemplated under [OCGA Â§ 15-19-52]. As such, [her] filing of [the] petition[s] seeking a court hearing on the revocation of [Wolcottâ€™s] probation does not entail the unauthorized practice of law, such as when a layman represents another, unrelated â€œpersonâ€ in a legal capacity. [Cit.] Thus, Â·Â·Â· [Ms. Clark] was authorized to act on behalf of the State of Georgia in filling out the revocation petition[s]. Â Leverette v. State, 248 Ga.App. 304, 305(1), 546 S.E.2d 63 (2001).\r\n\r\nWolcott at 480 (Ga. 2004).\r\nIn Noethtich v. State, 676 B.E.2d 1078 (Ind. App. 1997), the Indiana Court of Appeals found it did not constitute the unauthorized practice of law for a probation agent, a state-employee, to file a probation revocation petition.Â  The court asseverated:\r\n\r\nAs a part of its supervisory duties, the court appointed the probation officer who was directly responsible to the court and subject to its orders. Â The trial court was a neutral and detached hearing body which functioned in a judicial capacity and did not take on the role of a prosecutor merely because its probation officer initiated revocation proceedings. Â Under the circumstances, the probation officer took action on behalf of the trial court, which action allowed the trial court to enforce obedience to its lawful orders. Â The probation officer did not render legal advice to a client and did not engage in the practice of law before the court.\r\n\r\nNoethtich at 1083.\r\nThe Court of Appeals of Washington has addressed whether it was permissible for a district court commissioner to assign a probation officer the responsibility for setting the specific conditions of probation for a criminal defendant.Â  State v. Williams, 983 P.2d 687 (Wash. App. Div. 1, 1999).Â  Finding that the officer was not engaging in the unauthorized practice of law for undertaking this responsibility, the court stated, â€œThe probation officer was carrying out administrative tasks assigned by the court, not preparing legal instruments to secure legal rights for clients.â€Â  Id. at 693.\r\nIn Furtado v. Furtado, 402 N.E.2d 1024 (Mass. 1980), the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts addressed if was proper for a probation officer to appear before a probate court for the purpose of prosecuting a contempt proceeding for nonsupport.Â  Finding that such was allowed, the court opined:\r\n\r\n[W]e do not regard as improper a probation officerâ€™s preparation and filing of a complaint for civil or criminal contempt, or both, pursuant to his statutory duties. Â The Legislature has said that a probation officer of a Probate Court shall bring into court when necessary, by citation or otherwise, all persons who are delinquent in making payments ordered or decreed by the court.â€\r\n. . . \r\nIt would not be improper for a probation officer to appear in a Probate Court for the purpose of prosecuting a contempt proceeding for nonsupport. Â Courts are the ultimate arbiters of who may practice law before them, but we give substantial deference to the views of the Legislature on such a subject. Â The Stateâ€™s interest in compliance with support orders is substantial and is particularly intense in a case such as this, where, as we were told at oral argument, the defendantâ€™s child was receiving public assistance. Â Police prosecutors, who normally are not members of the bar, customarily prosecute offenses, particularly minor offenses, in the District and Municipal Courts of the Commonwealth. Â The Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure expressly state that a police officer may be a â€œprosecutor,â€ as defined in Rule 2(b) (13), -- Mass. -- (1979). Â Thus, certain criminal proceedings may be prosecuted by a person who is not a member of the bar.\r\n\r\nFurtado at 1033-34 (internal citations, footnotes, and quotations omitted).\r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court has held that police officers may prosecute traffic offenses in magistrateâ€™s court and in municipal court without engaging in the unauthorized practice of law.Â  In re Unauthorized Practice of Law Rules Proposed by the South Carolina Bar, 309 S.C. 304, 422 S.E.2d 123 (1992).Â  The court first addressed this matter in State v. Messervy, 258 S.C. 110, 187 S.E.2d 524, (1972):\r\n\r\nIt has long been the practice in the magistratesâ€™ courts of this State for the arresting patrolman to prosecute the cases which he has made. The procedure has been followed under a ruling of the attorney general since 1958. Â Ideally, the Stateâ€™s case would be presented by a prosecuting attorney, but unfortunately such is not practicable because of the large number of traffic court violations.\r\nAccording to appellantâ€™s brief the highway patrol made 236,000 arrests during 1970.\r\n\r\nMesservy, 258 S.C. at 113, 187 S.E.2d at 525 (internal citations omitted).Â  The court recited from a New Hampshire Supreme Court decision permitting police officers to prosecute cases and found:\r\n\r\nIn New Hampshire, as in South Carolina, there was no statute prohibiting a police officer from prosecuting a case. Â The practice in New Hampshire was approved under the common law. Â We do likewise.\r\nWhile such practice is not without its faults, neither is it without its safeguards. Â The patrolmanâ€™s conduct (same as an attorney) is subject to the scrutiny of the magistrate at all times, and if the patrolmanâ€™s conduct of the case is not proper it is the duty of the magistrate to make appropriate rulings, and in an appropriate case, grant a new trial. \r\n\r\nId.Â  \r\nFinding permissible the practice of allowing supervisory officers to assist arresting officers in the prosecution of misdemeanor traffic violations in magistrateâ€™s court, our Supreme Court has inculcated:\r\n\r\nWhen the officers of the Highway Patrol present misdemeanor traffic violations in the magistratesâ€™ courts, whether as the arresting officer or a supervisory officer assisting the arresting officer, they do so in their official capacities as law enforcement officers and employees of the State. Â These officers do not hold themselves out to the public as attorneys, and their activity in the magistratesâ€™ courts does not jeopardize the public by placing â€œincompetent and unlearned individuals in the practice of law.â€ Â To the contrary, this activity renders an important service to the public by promoting the prompt and efficient administration of justice.\r\nWe can discern no purpose or policy consistent with Section 40-5-310 and Rule IV that would be served by enjoining the Highway Patrol from continuing this activity, and therefore hold the prosecution of misdemeanor traffic violations in the magistratesâ€™ courts by either the arresting officer or a supervisory officer assisting the arresting officer does not constitute the unlawful practice of law in violation of Section 40-5-310 and Rule IV.\r\n\r\nState ex rel. McLeod v. Seaborn, 270 S.C. 696, 698-699, 244 S.E.2d 317, 319 (1978) (internal citation omitted).\r\nSummating these earlier cases, the court elucidated, â€œBecause of the impracticality of a prosecuting attorney presenting every traffic court violation, this court has permitted the practice of allowing an arresting officer to prosecute the case in magistrateâ€™s court.â€Â  State v. Sossaman, 298 S.C. 72, 73, 378 S.E.2d 259, 260 (1989).\r\nIf a police officer can prosecute a traffic offense in magistrateâ€™s and municipal court, a probation agent can certainly present a probation violation case at a probation revocation hearing without engaging in the unauthorized practice of law.Â  By comparison, a probation revocation proceeding does not even rise to the level of a prosecution, instead being considered a more informal proceeding with respect to notice and proof of the alleged violation.Â  State v. Franks, 276 S.C. 636 281 S.E.2d 227 (1981).Â  Due to the copious number of probation revocation hearings held in this state every year, efficiency and practicality require that non-lawyer probation officers be empowered to present at these proceedings on behalf of the State.\r\nIt is standard practice in South Carolina for a probation agent to appear in court and present the allegations contained in the written violation report described in S.C. Code Â§ 24-21-450.Â  The probation agent can then answer any questions from the court and the defense attorney regarding the violations contained in the report. Â Furthermore, the probation agentâ€™s preparation of a violation report and submission of this report to the court are specifically required by statute.Â  The probation agent is deemed by statute to be the official representative of the court.Â  Any appearance by the agent in court to present and explain the charged violations does not constitute the unauthorized practice of law.Â  \r\nThis issue has been recently decided with certitude by the South Carolina Supreme Court in State v. Barlow. Â Op. No. 26294 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Mar. 26, 2007) (Davis Adv. Sh. No. 12 at 47).Â  Barlow edifies:\r\n\r\n[W]hen a probation agent presents a probation revocation case, the agent is acting in his official capacity and is not holding himself out to the public as an attorney.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-280(B).Â  Clearly, the agent â€œrenders an important service to the public by promoting the prompt and efficient administration of justice.â€Â  Seaborn, 270 S.C. at 699, 244 S.E.2d at 319.Â  Thus, we reject appellantsâ€™ argument that the non-attorneysâ€™ actions in these cases amounted to the unauthorized practice of law.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on State v. Barlow, supra, the ruling of the circuit judge is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, KITTREDGE, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-156","title":"State v.

Austin, Jr., of Leesburg, Florida, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  A special referee granted Carolyn Songer Austinâ€™s request for a permanent injunction in this action involving the application of restrictive covenants.Â  W.J. Enterprises, Inc., H.D.S. Builders, L.L.C., Barb Loebig, and the National Bank of Commerce (collectively, â€œAppellantsâ€) appeal the ruling.Â  We reverse. \r\nFACTS\r\nAustin owns Lot 23 in Hilton Head Beach Subdivision No. 2 (the â€œSubdivisionâ€).Â  Appellants either own or have an interest in Lot 18.[1]Â  Austin alleges Appellants subdivided their lot into two lots and built homes upon the two lots in violation of restrictive covenants applicable to the Subdivision. \r\nThe Subdivision is located on oceanfront property on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.Â  A plat of the Subdivision recorded on July 7, 1953, shows J Street (now known as Jacana Street) separates Lots 18 and 23.Â  J Street runs from Baynard Avenue (now called North Forest Beach Drive) to the seaward boundary of the Subdivision.Â  Â Â \r\nThe Hilton Head Company owned and developed the Subdivision, but during the 1950s conveyed some of its land to the Hilton Head Land Company, a partnership.Â  \r\nIn 1954, the Hilton Head Company executed and recorded a declaration providing that â€œthe Hilton Head Company, its successors and assignsâ€ shall hold a portion of the property between the high water mark and the front lot line of the lots in the Subdivision â€“ commonly referred to as â€œstrand propertyâ€ â€“ â€œin Trust . . . for the use and benefit of all present and future property owners of any lot or lots in Hilton Head Beach Subdivision No. 2.â€Â  Â Â \r\nIn 1956, the Hilton Head Company, with the agreement of the Hilton Head Land Company, adopted a set of restrictions applicable to the Subdivision (the â€œ1956 Restrictionsâ€).Â  They established setback lines and procedures for subdividing lots and changing boundary lines.Â  The 1956 Restrictions provide in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.Â  RESIDENTIAL AREASÂ  That portion of the lands of The Hilton Head Company situated on Hilton Head Island, State of South Carolina, referred to as The Hilton Head Beach Subdivisions . . . shall be subject to the following covenants running with the land.\r\n    1.Â  All lots . . . shall be used for residential purposes exclusively.Â  No structur[e]s shall be erected, altered, placed or permitted to remain on any lot, other than one (1) detached single family dwelling . . . .Â Â Â  \r\n    . . . .\r\n    3.Â  No building shall be located on any lot nearer than twenty (20) feet to the front line, nor nearer than ten (10) feet to any adjacent streetline, nor nearer than five (5) feet to any lot line.\r\n    . . . .\r\n    10.Â  No lot shall be subdivided without the consent of The Hilton Head Company, or The Hilton Head Land Company (if title was derived from the later [sic] company)[,] their successors or assigns; provided, however, that no lot may be so reduced to a size less than 8,000 square feet, or have a frontage less than 60 feet in length, without the written consent of both The Hilton Head Company and The Hilton Head Land Company. Â (Emphasis added.)Â Â Â Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe Hilton Head Land Company subsequently ceased operations when the partnership disbanded around 1960.Â  It no longer owns property on Hilton Head Island.Â  \r\nAustinâ€™s lot lies across Jacana Street from Lot 18.Â  A replatting of Lot 18 in 1997 included a portion of the strand property[2] and a replatting of Lot 18 in 2002 subdivided the lot into Lots 18A and 18B.Â  Lot 18, as originally platted, was 100 feet wide.Â  The new lots each contain frontage of less than sixty feet, one being forty-five feet wide and the other fifty-five feet wide. Â Â Â Â \r\nBy a memorandum dated July 31, 2002, W.J. Enterprises obtained the consent of Hilton Head Beach Subdivision No. 2 Assets Holding Corporation (â€œAssets Holdingâ€), the successor to the Hilton Head Company, to subdivide Lot 18.Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn September 2002, Austin filed a complaint against the Town of Hilton Head Island, seeking an injunction to set aside the Townâ€™s approval of the subdivision of Lot 18 and prohibiting construction closer than twenty feet to the front line of Lot 18.Â  She later amended her complaint, adding Appellants as parties.Â  In her prayer for relief, so far as is now relevant here in view of the dismissal of the Town from the action, she requested an injunction (a) prohibiting the subdivision of Lot 18 and the incorporation of the strand property into Lot 18; and (b) prohibiting construction of a building closer than twenty feet to the front line of Lot 18.Â  \r\nThe circuit court transferred the case to a special referee, who held a hearing in April 2003.Â  In his order, the referee essentially determined the homes were in violation of the 1956 Restrictions because Lot 18 was subdivided into smaller lots with less than sixty feet of frontage without proper authorization and the homes violated both the front and streetline setback provisions.Â  \r\nThe referee granted relief to Austin, issuing an injunction prohibiting (1) the subdivision of Lot 18 into sublots having a frontage of less than sixty feet; (2) the incorporation of the strand property into Lot 18; and (3) the construction of a building nearer than twenty feet to the original front line of Lot 18 and nearer than ten feet to the streetline of Jacana Street.Â  Moreover, the referee ruled Appellants â€œshall . . . remove any and all structures or improvements from Lot 18 that violate the restrictive covenants applicable to Lot 18.â€Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAn action to enforce restrictive covenants by injunction is in equity.â€Â  Gibbs v. Kimbrell,&nbsp;311 S.C. 261, 267, 428 S.E.2d 725, 729&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1993).Â  â€œIn equitable actions, the appellate court may review the record and make findings of fact in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Grosshuesch v. Cramer,&nbsp;367 S.C. 1, 4, 623 S.E.2d 833, 834&nbsp;(2005).Â  Under this broad scope of review, however, the appellate court is not required to ignore the findings of the referee, who is in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses.Â  See, e.g., Anderson v.

App. 1994).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Subdivision of Lot\r\nThe referee ruled Appellants failed to comply with the 1956 Restrictions, in part, because they did not obtain the consent of the Hilton Head Land Company to subdivide Lot 18 into two lots with frontages of less than sixty feet.Â  Consequently, the referee prohibited Appellants from subdividing Lot 18.Â  On appeal, Appellants contend the issue of obtaining the consent of the Hilton Head Land Company was not properly before the referee as it was never pled in Austinâ€™s amended complaint and there was no notice to Appellants that this was to be a contested issue.Â  \r\nIn her amended complaint, Austin did not assert the approval of the Hilton Head Land Company was required to subdivide Lot 18.Â  Rather, she expressly alleged Property Research Holding, Inc. was the successor of the Hilton Head Company, it had â€œthe exclusive right to approve the subdivision ofâ€ Lot 18, and it had not consented to the subdivision of the lot.Â  (Emphasis added.) Â Â Â Â Â \r\nDuring the hearing before the referee, Frank Mead, a principal in Assets Holding, testified Assets Holding, not Property Research, is actually the successor corporation in this matter, and Assets Holding had given Appellants written approval for the subdivision of the property.Â  Assets Holding had acquired the interests of Property Research.Â  \r\nThe referee, nevertheless, found Appellants had violated the 1956 Restrictions because they did not obtain the approval of the Hilton Head Land Company for the subdivision of Lot 18.Â  This finding was based on the provision in the 1956 Restrictions stating a lot could be subdivided to have a frontage of less than sixty feet if approved in writing by both the Hilton Head Company and the Hilton Head Land Company.Â  \r\nWe find the issue of whether the Hilton Head Land Company had given its approval and whether the lack of consent would constitute a violation of the 1956 Restrictions was not properly before the referee.Â  Although we recognize issues may be deemed tried by consent and a party may move to amend the pleadings to conform to the evidence under Rule 15(b), SCRCP, we do not believe the current appeal presents an appropriate case for application of this rule.Â  \r\nAustin never requested, before, during, or even after the hearing in this matter, an amendment of her complaint to allege a violation of the 1956 Restrictions because Appellants did not obtain the approval of the Hilton Head Land Company to subdivide Lot 18.Â  Although Austinâ€™s counsel did ask Mead during the hearing whether the Hilton Head Land Company had approved the subdividing of Lot 18, Mead simply responded, without contradiction, that the Hilton Head Land Company was a partnership that no longer existed.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThere is no indication in the record that Appellants or even Austin, for that matter, ever recognized that Austin was abandoning or changing her original argument on this point, i.e., that Property Research had the exclusive right to approve any lot changes.Â  At the end of the hearing, Austinâ€™s counsel started to move to amend Austinâ€™s pleadings to conform to the evidence, but when an objection was made by opposing counsel that Austin needed to specify how the pleadings were to be altered, Austinâ€™s counsel could not state in what way there was a variance from the pleadings.Â  \r\nThe referee commented he was also unaware of any variance.Â  The referee, therefore, declined to rule on the motion, saying he would take it under advisement â€œin case you ever need it,â€ but Austin never renewed the motion or requested a ruling upon it.Â  It is important also that the referee never found the issue was tried by consent before addressing it in his order, whereupon Appellants made a post-trial motion to alter or amend the judgment.Â  The motion was made on the basis that, among other things, the issue was not pled and the only successor corporation is Assets Holding, as the Hilton Head Company has not existed for some time.\r\nWe think that, considering all the circumstances, it would be prejudicial to Appellants and contrary to the record to conclude this issue was fully litigated with the knowledge of all parties.Â  See Williams v. Addison, 314 S.C. 35, 38, 443 S.E.2d 582, 584 (Ct. App. 1994) (â€œ[T]his Court will not find implied consent to try an issue if all of the parties did not recognize it as an issue during trial, even though there is evidence in the recordâ€“introduced as relevant to some other issueâ€“which would support the amendment.Â  This is so because the opposing party may not be conscious of the relevance of the evidence to issues not raised by the pleadings if the relevance is not otherwise made clear.â€ (citation omitted)).Â  We therefore reverse the refereeâ€™s finding that Appellants violated the 1956 Restrictions based on the lack of consent of the long-defunct Hilton Head Land Company.\r\nII.Â  Setbacks\r\nThe referee found Appellants violated the 1956 Restrictions in two respects: (1) by building within twenty feet of the front line of the property boundary; and (2) by building within ten feet of Jacana Street.Â  Appellants contend the referee erred in finding they violated these setback provisions.Â  \r\nAs for the twenty-foot setback, we agree with Appellants that there is no evidence in the record to support this finding.Â  There were only two witnesses who testified at the hearing â€“ Austin and Mead, a principal of Assets Holding.Â  Although Austin alleged in her amended complaint that the homes violated the twenty-foot setback provision, at the hearing Austin was unable to testify as to the position of the homes that had been placed on what was formerly Lot 18.Â  Mead, in turn, stated he could only â€œspeculateâ€ about the distance, but ultimately testified that he believed the homes were in compliance with the twenty-foot setback.Â  In concluding the homes violated the twenty-foot setback, the referee did not make any findings regarding the position of the homes and cited no measurements regarding the distances of any structures from the setback lines.Â  Thus, we reverse the refereeâ€™s finding that Appellants were in violation of the twenty-foot setback provision.\r\nAs for the ten-foot setback, Austin did not plead a violation of this particular restriction in her amended complaint, she did not move to amend her pleadings to assert a violation of this provision, and the referee never made a finding that the issue was tried by consent before ruling Appellants were in violation of the ten-foot streetline setback.Â  Austin suggests the issue was tried by consent because a witness was asked at the hearing whether any structure on Lot 18 was located within ten feet of Jacana Street.\r\nAppellants moved to alter or amend the refereeâ€™s order to the extent that he found the ten-foot streetline setback provision had been violated because Austin had not pled this issue in the amended complaint.Â  As in the case of the issue relating to the alleged failure by Appellants to obtain the consent of the Hilton Head Land Company where the pleadings did not put Appellants on notice that the issue was to be litigated, we likewise hold and for the same reasons determine it would be unfair under the circumstances to conclude an issue regarding whether Appellants violated the ten-foot street setback restriction was tried by consent.Â  This is especially appropriate since the referee did not make this determination when asked to do so and, had he done so, Appellants would then have had an opportunity to offer evidence on the issue.Â  We recognize Austin attached a copy of the 1956 Restrictions to the amended complaint, introduced into evidence without objection a copy thereof, and questioned a witness, without objection, about whether any structure on Lot 18 was located within ten feet of Jacana Street; however, without more, these actions alone, in our view, did not suffice to place Appellants on notice that Austin was alleging a violation of the restriction relating to the ten-foot streetline setback.Â  See Williams, 314 S.C. at 38, 443 S.E.2d at 584.\r\nIn any event, the record does not support a finding that Appellants violated the ten-foot streetline setback.Â  Austinâ€™s testimony on this point was generally that she thought Appellants built too close to Jacana Street.Â  She acknowledged, however, that she had not been out to the property to take any measurements.[3]Â  Further, although Austin claims Meadâ€™s testimony provides evidence of a violation, his testimony, as we understand it, does not do so.Â  Mead testified the construction did not violate any applicable setback provisions because the structures were â€œless than ten feet . . . from a park area . . . [and] not from a street line.â€[4]Â  Accordingly, we reverse the refereeâ€™s finding that Austin established Appellants were in violation of the ten-foot setback.Â  \r\nREVERSED.[5]\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Austin alleged in her amended complaint that W.J. Enterprises owned Lot 18, H.D.S. Builders received a building permit for the construction of a house on Lot 18, Loebig contracted to purchase a portion of Lot 18, and the National Bank of Commerce held a mortgage on all or part of Lot 18.Â  \r\n[2]Â  Appellants trace whatever interest they hold to the portion of the strand property that was incorporated into Lot 18 to a series of transactions that originated with the Hilton Head Company and involved transfers to Property Research, to Assets Holding, to D.H. and Associates, and finally to Appellants.Â  \r\n[3] Â We recognize Austin also asserted an as-built survey that she received from the Town would show Appellants built too close to the line; however, she then stated she was not certain of the measurements.Â  Moreover, she failed to bring the survey with her to submit as evidence at the hearing.Â Â Â  \r\n[4] Â In an affidavit dated November 6, 2002, Mead similarly asserted the homes on what was formerly Lot 18 did not violate any of the applicable restrictions.\r\n[5] Based on our decision to reverse, we need not address Appellantsâ€™ remaining arguments.Â  In particular, we do not address the refereeâ€™s ruling regarding the incorporation of the strand property into Lot 18.Â  Appellants maintain that if we agree there is no violation of the front-lot, setback line, â€œthis court need not address the legal status of the strand property.â€Â  Apparently, Austin agrees with this assessment, being she does not contradict this statement anywhere in her Respondentâ€™s Brief.Â  Cf. Rule 208(a)(4), SCACR (â€œUpon the failure of respondent to timely file a brief, the appellate court may take such action as it deems proper.â€).Â  Suffice it to say, Austin failed to show Appellants encroached upon the strand property.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-173","title":"State v.

Clare of the South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, of Columbia; for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all Â of Columbia; and Solicitor Warren B. Giese, of Columbia; for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Appellant, Henry Dondie Ellison, Jr., appeals his convictions of burglary in the first degree, kidnapping, assault and battery with intent to kill (ABIK), and violation of an order of protection, asserting the trial court erred in admitting evidence of a prior bad act.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nEllisonâ€™s convictions arose from an attack on Permeco Myers that occurred on October 16, 2004.Â  Permeco testified at trial to the events leading up to the attack.Â  She stated that she had known Ellison for over twenty years, the two being involved in an on and off relationship during that time.Â  In June 2003, Ellison moved into Permecoâ€™s home.Â  Permeco and Ellison lived together for a little over a year, until Permeco obtained an order of protection against Ellison.Â  She testified that in August 2004, she was asleep in bed when Ellison came into the bedroom and began choking her.Â  Ellison accused Permeco of seeing another man behind his back.Â  Permeco tried to explain that was not the case, but Ellison was very upset.Â  When she denied the accusation, Ellison began slapping her.Â  Ellison loaded a gun and told Permeco, â€œIâ€™m going to have to kill you like the lady across the street,â€ referring to an incident a few months earlier where a man had killed a woman who lived across the street and then killed himself.Â  Ellison then forced Permeco to open her mouth, at which time he put the barrel of the gun in her mouth.Â  During this time, Ellison was still â€œfussingâ€ at Permeco, but began to calm down and started to apologize to her, stating that he was not going to kill her.Â  Ellison told Permeco, however, that he would kill her if she called the police.Â  To assuage his fear and convince him she would not go to the police, Permeco told Ellison she would take the next day off from work. Â They both stayed home from work that next day.\r\n \r\nThe following day, Permeco went to work and used that opportunity to call the police in order to get some information on how she could get Ellison out of her house.Â  She ultimately contacted Sistercare, and was put in touch with a legal advocacy person, Ms. Gilyard.Â  When Permeco went to see Ms. Gilyard, they filled out an order of protection.Â  The order was not served that day, however, as they determined Permeco should try to talk to Ellison first and see if he would voluntarily agree to move out.Â  Permeco left the paperwork with Ms. Gilyard and went to a hotel room, concerned with Ellisonâ€™s reaction to her visit to Sistercare.Â  Permeco stayed in the hotel room overnight.Â  When she informed Ellison about the matter, he was not happy, but he agreed to remove his belongings from the house.Â  Permeco expected Ellison to have moved his things when she returned home, but he had not.Â  When Ellison came back to the house, he told Permeco he needed more time.Â  A week went by and Permeco continued to remind Ellison that he promised to leave.Â  After three or four weeks, Permeco returned to Sistercare because Ellison was still in the home and he had again been accusing her of seeing someone else.Â  During this entire time, Permeco was frightened.Â  She informed Ms. Gilyard she was leaving town, and she requested emergency leave from her employer.Â  The police were going to serve notice of the hearing for an order of protection, and Permeco quickly left Columbia, staying out of town with a cousin approximately one week until the hearing on the matter.Â  Thereafter, when Permeco arrived at the courthouse, Ellison approached her and tried to convince her not go inside for the hearing.Â  Permeco and Ellison both attended the hearing and an order of protection was issued, which directed Ellison to vacate the home by 3:00 that afternoon, October 7, 2004.Â  In her affidavit supporting her request for an order of protection, Permeco related that on August 17, 2004, Ellison yelled at her, slapped her, choked her, pointed a gun at her and threatened to kill her if she were to go to the police.Â \r\n \r\nDuring the next week, Permeco had locks in her home changed.Â  On October 16, she returned to her home from the grocery store around 1:00 or 2:00 in the afternoon.Â  She used her keys to unlock her front door.Â  When she entered the doorway between her living room and kitchen, she looked up and saw Ellison standing there.Â  As she began to speak, she was hit in the head with a bottle, and fell to the floor.Â  Ellison then picked Permeco up by her shirt and slapped her with an open hand, causing her to fall back to the floor.Â  He picked her up again and began â€œfussing and calling [her] all kinds of names.â€Â  Ellison took Permeco through the kitchen, opening drawers and looking for tape.Â  He retrieved two knives, bolted the front door, and took Permeco to the bedroom.Â  Ellison sat Permeco on the bed and used the tape to tie her hands.Â  He continued to curse Permeco and call her names.Â  He then made her stand up, and got behind her.Â  Ellison â€œstarted taking [one of the knives] across [her] neck.â€Â  He stated that the order of protection meant nothing to him.Â  Ellison remained behind Permeco and continued â€œfussing.â€Â  At one point, the floor made a creaking sound and Ellison stabbed Permeco in the right thigh, making the comment, â€œNow you see that Iâ€™m serious.â€Â  Ellison held his hand over Permecoâ€™s mouth.Â  He was still talking and was angry.Â  He then stabbed Permeco in the chest.Â  She fell to the ground and pretended she was dead.Â  As Permeco lay on the floor, Ellison hollered, â€œCome and get me because I have lost everything I love.â€Â  Permeco did not move or say anything, but continued to play dead.Â  Ellison got behind her on the floor and held Permeco.Â  He then carved their initials on the baseboard of the bed.Â  He also cut off chunks of Permecoâ€™s hair.Â  After Permeco had been on the floor for awhile, Ellison stated, â€œI know youâ€™re not dead.Â  God didnâ€™t mean for me to kill you.â€Â  At that point, based on what he had said during the August assault and the fact that he did not kill her during that incident, she believed Ellison was not going to kill her, and she â€œslowly just came out of it.â€ Â Ellison helped Permeco to her feet, helped her change her clothes, cut the tape off her hands, and put her in the bed.Â  After awaking the next morning, Permeco thought she heard Ellison using the telephone.Â  Once she believed he had left the home, she called an ambulance.Â  Upon arrival at the hospital, Permeco was found to have sustained two stab wounds to the chest, one of which was approximately one and a half inches deep.Â  She also suffered abrasions across her neck, a fractured bone in her left cheek, and one stab wound each to the thigh and flank.Â  Investigators determined the perpetrator apparently gained access to the home through a window above the sink in Permecoâ€™s kitchen that had been broken into from the outside.Â \r\n \r\nPrior to trial, Ellisonâ€™s attorney made a motion to exclude evidence of the August incident.Â  Counsel noted the State sought to admit the evidence pursuant to the motive and intent exceptions under State v. Lyle.[2]Â  Agreeing that the evidence would be probative of motive and intent,[3] counsel nonetheless asserted the August incident was inadmissible under Rule 403, SCRE,[4] as the prejudicial effect of the prior bad act outweighed the probative value of the evidence.Â  Counsel maintained, because the defense was not disputing there was a valid order of protection, any probative value concerning the August incident itself was outweighed by its prejudicial effect and was therefore inadmissible pursuant to Rule 403, SCRE. Â The State countered that, not only was the evidence probative of motive, but also tended to establish the malice element of the ABIK charge.Â  Additionally, the State argued the evidence was admissible under the res gestae theory. Â The trial court held an in camera hearing on the matter at which time Permeco related the unfolding events.Â  Based on the testimony presented, the trial court found the probative value of the evidence was not outweighed by its prejudicial effect, and permitted the introduction of the prior incident to show motive, intent, and malice.Â \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, this court sits to review errors of law only and is bound by the trial courts factual findings unless those findings are clearly erroneous. Â State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001). Â The trial courtâ€™s decision to admit evidence, including prior bad act evidence, is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.Â  Id. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.Â  Thus, we do not re-evaluate the facts based on our own view of the preponderance of the evidence, but simply determine whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Ellison contends the trial court erred by admitting evidence of his prior bad act because the evidence was not necessary to prove motive or intent, and the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighed its probative value.Â  Ellison maintains the State needed only to produce the order of protection to prove violation of the same, and the details underlying the order were neither relevant nor necessary.Â  He further asserts his motive and intent during the October incident could have been inferred from the circumstances surrounding the charges, including the alleged burglary, kidnapping, and the extent of Myersâ€™ injuries. Â He therefore argues the details of the August assault were not relevant to the current charges or necessary to prove any material fact in issue.Â  Additionally, Ellison contends, even if the August incident details were relevant, the prejudicial effect of this evidence outweighed its probative value. Â Â We disagree.\r\nEvidence of other crimes or bad acts is inadmissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.Â Â  Such evidence may be admissible, however, to show motive, identity, the existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or intent. Â Rule 404(b), SCRE;Â  State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923).Â  Importantly, the bad act must be logically relevant to the crime with which the defendant is charged.Â  State v. Beck 342 S.C. 129, 135, 536 S.E.2d 679, 682-83 (2000).Â  Even if the prior bad act evidence is relevant, it must nonetheless be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.Â  Rule 403, SCRE.Â  State v. Smith, 337 S.C. 27, 33, 522 S.E.2d 598, 601 (1999).Â  Thus, after conducting a Lyle/Rule 404(b) analysis and finding evidence of a prior bad act both relevant and admissible as a prior bad act, the trial court must conduct a Rule 403, SCRE analysis to determine whether the evidence should be excluded as unduly prejudicial.Â  Beck, 342 S.C. at 136, 536 S.E.2d at 683.\r\nAdditionally, evidence of prior bad acts may also be properly admitted as part of the res gestae of the crimes for which the defendant is charged.Â  Under the res gestae theory, evidence of other bad acts may be considered an integral part of the crime with which the defendant is charged or may be needed to aid the fact finder in understanding the context in which the crime occurred.Â  State v. Owens, 346 S.C. 637, 652, 552 S.E.2d 745, 753 (2001) overruled on other grounds by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005).Â  Our Supreme Court proclaimed the following in regard to this theory:\r\n\r\n\tOne of the accepted bases for the admissibility of evidence of other crimes arises when such evidence â€œfurnishes part of the context of the crimeâ€ or is necessary to a â€œfull presentationâ€ of the case, or is so intimately connected with and explanatory of the crime charged against the defendant and is so much a part of the setting of the case and its â€œenvironmentâ€ that its proof is appropriate in order â€œto complete the story of the crime on trial by proving its immediate context or the â€˜res gestaeâ€™â€ or the â€œuncharged offense is â€˜so linked together in point of time and circumstances with the crime charged that one cannot be fully shown without proving the other . . .â€™ [and is thus] part of the res gestae of the crime charged.â€Â Â  And where evidence is admissible to provide this â€œfull presentationâ€ of the offense, â€œ[t]here is no reason to fragmentize the event under inquiryâ€ by suppressing parts of the â€œres gestae.â€\r\n\r\nState v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 122, 470 S.E.2d 366, 370-71 (1996) (quoting United States v. Masters, 622 F.2d 83, 86 (4th Cir. 1980) (alterations in original)). Â Â Even if the evidence is relevant under this theory, the trial court must, as it does following a Lyle/Rule 404(b) analysis, conduct a Rule 403, SCRE analysis, determining whether the probative value outweighs the prejudicial effect.Â  Owens, 346 S.C. at 652, 552 S.E.2d at 753.Â  \r\n \r\nWe first note, while Ellison argued before the trial court that the prejudicial effect of the prior bad act outweighed its probative value, he conceded that the August incident was probative of motive and intent.Â  Because Ellison did not argue below that the August incident was not relevant, but conceded this point, his assertion to the contrary on appeal is not preserved for our review.Â  See Â State v. Benton, 338 S.C. 151, 156-57, 526 S.E.2d 228, 231 (2000) (noting an issue conceded to the trial court cannot be raised on appeal).\r\nAt any rate, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s determination that the evidence was probative of motive and intent.Â  At trial, the defense did not contest the assault on Permeco, but maintained Ellison was not the perpetrator.Â  In the August incident, Ellison became suddenly violent with Permeco, indicated that he was contemplating killing her at that time, and stated he would kill her if she later went to the police.Â  Less than ten days after the issuance of the order of protection that was based on the August incident, Permeco was assaulted.Â  Thus, the prior bad act evidence is logically relevant to show Ellisonâ€™s motive and intent.Â  Further, as noted by the trial court, the August incident was relevant to the issue of malice.Â  Here, the State was required to prove malice as an element of the ABIK charge.Â  State v. Sweat, Â 362 S.C. 117, 124, 606 S.E.2d 508, 512 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  While motive, generally, is not an element the prosecution must prove to establish a crime, motive frequently is circumstantial evidence of the intent to commit the crime when intent or state of mind is an issue. Id.Â  When malice or willfulness is an element of the crime, state of mind is an issue.Â  Id. at 124-25, 606 S.E.2d at 512.\r\nWe further find the prior bad act evidence was admissible under the res gestae theory.[5] Â The August incident â€œfurnishes part of the context of the crimeâ€ and allows for a â€œfull presentationâ€ of the case.Â  It is â€œintimately connected with and explanatory ofâ€ the crimes charged against Ellison and â€œits proof is appropriate in order â€˜to complete the story of the crime on trial by proving its immediate context or the â€˜res gestae.â€™â€Â  State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 122, 470 S.E.2d 366, 370-71 (1996).Â  \r\n \r\nIt is further important to note the substantial factual similarity between the present case and State v. Sweat, 362 S.C. 117, 606 S.E.2d 508 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  In Sweat, the victim reported Sweat for criminal domestic violence in October 2001.Â  Sweat was released from jail after the victim signed a statement indicating the October incident did not actually occur.Â  On December 11, 2001, eleven days after being released from jail, the incident giving rise to Sweats convictions of first-degree burglary, AWIK and three counts of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature took place.Â  Id. at 121-22, 606 S.E.2d at 510-11.Â  This court determined evidence of the October incident was admissible to show motive and intent for the December crimes.Â  Id. at 124-26, 606 S.E.2d at 512-13.Â  As in Sweat, we find the prior bad act evidence was probative, as the jury could infer from the August incident both motive and intent; the motive being that Ellison was driven by anger that Permeco was severing her relationship with him and the intent being that Ellison maliciously sought to inflict harm on Permeco.Â  Additionally, this court held the prior bad act evidence in Sweat was admissible under the res gestae theory, as it tended to â€œcomplete the story of the crime on trial.â€Â  Id. at 133, 606 S.E.2d at 517.Â  As was the case in Sweat, the prior abuse and the events that followed provided the fact finder with the appropriate context in which to place the subsequent attack on which the current charges were based.Â  Id.\r\nEllison contends, however, even if the August incident was relevant to the current charges, the prejudicial effect of this prior bad act outweighs its probative value.Â  We disagree.\r\nEvidence is considered unfairly prejudicial if it has an undue tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis, such as an emotional one.Â  State v. Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. 526, 547, 552 S.E.2d 300, 311 (2001).Â  Whether prejudicial error has been committed must be determined on the basis of the entire record and the result will generally turn on the facts of each case.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 7, 545 S.E.2d 827, 830 (2001).Â  As previously noted, this court reviews the trial courtâ€™s decision to admit prior bad act evidence under an abuse of discretion standard and simply determines whether the trial courtâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence. Â Further, our supreme court has specifically noted that the appellate court reviews a trial courtâ€™s Rule 403, SCRE ruling, balancing whether the probative value of evidence was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect, pursuant to the abuse of discretion standard, and gives great deference to the trial courtâ€™s decision. Â State v. Myers, 359 S.C. 40, 48, 596 S.E.2d 488, 492 (2004).Â  The evidence of the prior assault on Permeco is clearly probative of Ellisonâ€™s motive and intent, and helps furnish the context of the crime under the res gestae theory.Â  Although the evidence of the August assault by Ellison on Permeco is certainly prejudicial, we cannot say it is unduly so.Â  Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial courtâ€™s admission of this evidence.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, appellantâ€™s convictions are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923).\r\n[3] Specifically, counsel for Ellison stated, â€œMy main argument on that would not be so much that it doesnâ€™t go to motive and intent.Â  I think I would have to concede that there would be an argument based on that.â€Â  \r\n \r\n[4] â€œAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.â€ Rule 403, SCRE.\r\n[5] See Rule 220(c), SCACR (â€œ The appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, decision or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-178","title":"State v.

Savitz, III, South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Senior Assistant Attorney General William Edgar Salter, III, Office of the Attorney General, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Robert M. Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Vincent Raynard Allen (Allen) pled guilty to the charge of murder and an unrelated charge of burglary in the first degree.Â  Appearing pro se on the burglary charge, Allen waived presentment and pled guilty.Â  Allen claims the trial court committed reversible error when it failed to warn him of the dangers of self-representation pursuant to Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975), and Prince v. State, 301 S.C. 422, 392 S.E.2d 462 (1990).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 30, 2005, Allen pled guilty to murder and burglary in the first degree.Â  The day before Allen pled guilty, he wrote a letter to the prosecuting assistant solicitor, which the State subsequently entered into evidence.Â  In the letter, Allen stated the following: â€œI would like to enter a plea on the [b]urglary case when I go to court for the other charges and I have relieved [my counsel] in the case and would like to proceed without him being present.â€ Â Allen was represented by counsel on the murder charge, but he appeared pro se on the burglary charge. Â A grand jury indicted Allen on the murder charge, but Allen waived his right to presentment on the burglary charge. Â \r\nOn the day of Allenâ€™s plea, the trial court questioned Allenâ€™s decision to dismiss his counsel assigned to represent him on the burglary charge.Â \r\n \r\n\r\n\tCourt:Â  My main concern is that you know what youâ€™re doing on both of these two indictments.Â  Then Iâ€™ve got a lot of questions Iâ€™ve got to ask you to go through to satisfy myself that, number one, you know what youâ€™re doing, number two, youâ€™re waiving all of your rights that you need to waive and that the facts are correct, okay?\r\n\tAllen: Yes, sir.\r\n\t. . . \r\n\tCourt: Now, I understand that on the burglary indictment you are not represented; is that correct?\r\n\tAllen: By [my attorney], but heâ€™s not present.\r\n\t. . . \r\n\tCourt: Okay. But youâ€™re confident that youâ€™ve released him and that he knows heâ€™s not supposed to be here? I guess thatâ€™s my question. . . . You donâ€™t expect him to be here?\r\n\tAllen: Oh, no, sir. \r\n\tCourt: Thatâ€™s mainly what Iâ€™m looking for.Â  Do you feel confident that you can handle this plea without him today?\r\n\tAllen: Yes, sir.\r\n\tCourt: And without a lawyer?\r\n\tAllen: Yes, sir.Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial court then repeatedly questioned Allen regarding the consequences of pleading guilty to burglary. Â The trial court asked Allen if he understood that by pleading guilty, he would waive his constitutional rights, specifically his right to a jury trial, his right to remain silent, his right to confront witnesses, and his right to present a defense.Â  Allen responded that he understood he was waiving all of these rights by pleading guilty. Â \r\nAfter the State presented its version of the incident, the trial court asked Allen whether he had any medical problems.Â  Allen responded he recently had â€œdelusions,â€ but he felt â€œall rightâ€ that day, and he understood what was â€œgoing onâ€ in the courtroom.Â \r\n \r\nThe trial court then found that Allen knowingly and voluntarily pled guilty to the burglary charge, that he had the advice of counsel whom he subsequently released, and that Allen understood his attorney was not present.Â  When questioned by the trial court whether Allen was satisfied with his attorneyâ€™s representation of him, Allen said he was not, even though Allen talked with counsel over the course of the year about his case.Â  However, Allen still wanted to proceed without a lawyer, even when the trial court said it would appoint a lawyer if Allen so desired.\r\n \r\nAfter finding Allen knowingly and voluntarily pled guilty to burglary and voluntarily waived his right to counsel, the trial court accepted Allenâ€™s guilty plea. Â With the representation of counsel, Allen then pled guilty to murder.Â  Pursuant to a negotiated sentencing agreement between Allen and the State, the trial court sentenced him to thirty years imprisonment on each charge and ordered the sentences to run concurrently. Â This appeal followed.Â \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAllen claims his guilty plea for burglary was invalid because Allen did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his rights to counsel as required by Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975), and Prince v. State, 301 S.C. 422, 392 S.E.2d 462 (1990).Â  We disagree.\r\nTo establish a valid waiver of counsel, the trial court must advise the accused of his right to counsel and adequately warn the accused of the dangers of self-representation.Â  Prince v. State, 301 S.C. 422, 423, 392 S.E.2d 462, 463 (1990) (citing Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 835 (1975)). Â The trial court must determine that the accused has made a knowing and intelligent waiver. Â State v. Dixon, 269 S.C. 107, 109, 236 S.E.2d 419, 420 (1977) (internal citation omitted). \r\n \r\nIf the trial court fails to address the disadvantages of appearing pro se, as required by the second prong of Faretta, â€œthis Court will look to the record to determine whether [the accused] had sufficient background or was apprised of his rights by some other source.â€ Â Prince, 301 S.C. at 424, 392 S.E.2d at 463 (internal citation omitted).Â  The ultimate test in determining whether an accused has adequately waived his rights is not the trial courtâ€™s advice but rather the accusedâ€™s understanding.Â  Watts v. State, 347 S.C. 399, 402, 556 S.E.2d 368, 370 (2001).Â  Further, if the record shows that the accusedâ€™s decision to appear pro se is made with an understanding of the risks of self-representation, the requirements of voluntary waiver will be satisfied. Id. \r\n \r\nWhen the trial court has not directly advised the accused of his right to self-representation, this Court can consider several factors in determining whether the accused understands the dangers of self-representation.Â  These factors include, but are not limited to: \r\n \r\n\r\n\t(1) the accusedâ€™s age, educational background, and physical and mental health; (2) whether the accused was previously involved in criminal trials; (3) whether the accused knew the nature of the charge(s) and of the possible penalties; (4) whether the accused was represented by counsel before trial and whether that attorney explained to him the dangers of self-representation; (5) whether the accused was attempting to delay or manipulate the proceedings; (6) whether the court appointed stand-by counsel; (7) whether the accused knew he would be required to comply with the rules of procedure at trial; (8) whether the accused knew of legal challenges he could raise in defense to the charge(s) against him; (9) whether the exchange between the accused and the court consisted merely of\r\n\tpro forma answers to pro forma questions; and (10) whether the accusedâ€™s waiver resulted from either coercion or mistreatment.Â \r\n\t\r\n\r\nState v. Gardner, 351 S.C. 407, 412-13, 570 S.E.2d 184, 186-87 (2002).\r\nWhile evidence in the record proves that Allen was aware of his right to counsel, insufficient evidence exists to indicate the trial court specifically advised him on the dangers of self-representation.Â  However, after weighing the factors set forth in Gardner, we find Allen knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel. \r\n \r\nOn the date Allen pled guilty, he was thirty-one years old. Â Although he attended school only through the tenth grade, he had obtained his G.E.D.Â  At the plea hearing, Allen testified he suffers from an alcohol abuse problem.Â  However, Allen stated he had not consumed any drugs or alcohol within twenty-four hours of his plea, and he was not currently taking any drugs or medication. Â Allen also stated he had been examined for mental problems, namely delusions, but he understood what was going on and felt well enough to proceed.\r\n \r\nFurther, one of his two attorneys, who represented Allen on the murder charge, testified at the same proceeding that Allen understood the murder charge brought against him as well as the potential sentence that the trial court could impose against him.Â  Allen also informed the trial court he felt competent enough to plead guilty to murder. Â In addition, Allen wrote a letter to the prosecuting assistant solicitor, in which he stated â€œI have relieved [my counsel] in th[is] case and would like to proceed without him being present.â€\r\n \r\nThe trial court also questioned Allen on whether he had been in criminal court before that date.Â  Allen responded that he had previously been in criminal court on two separate occasions. Â It is unclear from the record whether Allen went to trial for those charges or pled guilty, but based on his previous appearances in the judicial system, we can logically presume that Allen had some knowledge about criminal proceedings.\r\n \r\nThe record clearly indicates that Allen understood the nature of the burglary charge and the possible penalties for that charge.Â  The State explained to the trial court the sentencing ranges for burglary in the first degree.Â  The trial court proceeded to ask Allen whether he understood the maximum possible sentence and whether Allen understood the negotiated plea and its intricacies, to which Allen responded that he did.Â  Further, when the State recited its version of the facts, which supported a charge of first degree burglary, Allen said he had no major disagreement with the Stateâ€™s version.\r\n \r\nWhile Allen was represented by counsel before he pled guilty to burglary, the record fails to indicate whether his former attorney warned him of the dangers of self-representation.Â  However, the trial court acknowledged that Allen had no counsel on the burglary charge at the time of the plea.Â  The trial court also asked whether Allen was satisfied with his former attorney and told Allen it would appoint a lawyer for him.Â \r\n \r\nThese facts are in direct opposition to Gardner v. State, in which our Supreme Court found the defendant did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to counsel, thus invalidating his guilty plea.Â  351 S.C. 407, 570 S.E.2d 184 (2002). Â Unlike the instant case, the court in Gardner stated: â€œ[T]he plea judge never even acknowledged that Petitioner did not have counsel with him at the plea hearing. Â The judge did not inquire about why Petitioner had relieved his counsel, or if he wished to have counsel present. Â There is absolutely no mention by the judge of anything relating to the right to an attorney . . . .â€ Â Id. at 412, 570 S.E.2d at 186.\r\nThe exchange between the trial court and Allen did not consist merely of pro forma answers to pro forma questions.Â  The court sufficiently questioned Allen on his right to representation and gave Allen an opportunity to explain his dissatisfaction with his former attorney as well as render Allenâ€™s version of the burglary incident.Â  (R.pp.9-10, 14).Â  Further, the trial court questioned Allen on whether he understood the constitutional rights he would be waiving if he pled guilty.Â  Unlike Gardner, the trial court fully complied with the mandates of Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238 (1969), it advised Allen of the maximum penalty for first degree burglary, it described the nature of the rights Allen was waiving by pleading guilty, and the trial court asked Allen for an admission of guilt.Â  351 S.C. at 414, 570 S.E.2d at 187.\r\nNothing in the record indicates that Allen was either coerced or manipulated into pleading guilty. Â When the trial court directly questioned him on this issue, Allen confirmed that no one had promised him anything or threatened him in order to make him plead guilty.Â \r\n \r\nThe record contains sufficient evidence to show that Allen understood the nature of his actions in waiving his right to counsel.Â  Consequently, we find the trial court did not err when it accepted Allenâ€™s guilty plea.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the decision of the trial court is accordingly\r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nHUFF, BEATTY, AND WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-183","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Sabrina C. Todd, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Donald V. Myers, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Raphael Hernandez, Honorio Guerrero, and Alfredo Avila-Arjona (collectively â€œAppellantsâ€) appeal the trial courtâ€™s denial of their motions for directed verdicts.Â  Appellants claim the State failed to produce any evidence showing Appellants knowingly attempted to possess the marijuana at issue.Â  Further, Appellants contend the State showed only that they were present at the scene, and their presence without the requisite knowledge warrants a reversal of the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  We affirm.Â \r\n \r\nFACTS\r\nOn May 14, 2002, United States customs agents discovered marijuana concealed inside furniture on a semi-trailer as it crossed into the United States from Mexico. Â Once the drugs were detected at the border, United States Customs and Border Protection contacted a customs agent in Greenville, South Carolina to arrange an undercover transfer of the drugs.Â  The furniture in which the drugs were hidden was scheduled to be delivered to Fredy DeLeon, owner of Tienda DeLeon, in Trenton, South Carolina.Â  Four days later, local, state, and federal authorities participated in a controlled delivery of approximately nine-hundred pounds of marijuana.Â \r\n \r\nOnce the delivery arrived at Tienda DeLeon, an undercover customs agent and two other men from the store unloaded a portion of the semi-trailerâ€™s cargo.Â  However, the majority of the cargo remained inside the semi-trailer.Â  DeLeon instructed the driver and the undercover agent to transport the remaining cargo to Billyâ€™s Super Store and to wait there until some gentlemen arrived.Â  When the driver and the customs agent arrived at Billyâ€™s Super Store, the undercover agent backed the semi-trailer up to a loading bay.Â  No one was present when the semi-trailer arrived.\r\n \r\nAfter approximately twenty-five or thirty minutes, a green Thunderbird, which was previously parked at Tienda DeLeon, drove past the semi-trailer.Â  The Thunderbird reappeared a few minutes later and pulled into the parking lot, immediately followed by a moving truck.Â  Appellant Guerrero drove the moving truck, and Appellants Hernandez and Avila-Arjona were passengers.Â  The moving truck stopped perpendicular to the front of the semi-trailer, and the Thunderbird pulled along the driverâ€™s side of the semi-trailer, making it impossible for the semi-trailer to leave.Â  The Thunderbirdâ€™s passenger approached the driverâ€™s side and attempted to get inside the semi-trailer. Â However, the undercover agent refused to allow him inside the semi-trailer.Â \r\n \r\nMeanwhile, the Thunderbirdâ€™s driver proceeded to talk with Appellants who were inside the moving truck.Â  According to the customs agent, at least one of the two men in the Thunderbird was initially present at Tienda DeLeon.Â  The Thunderbirdâ€™s passenger then instructed the driver and the customs agent to follow the moving truck and the Thunderbird.Â  The three vehicles drove for an extended period of time on unpaved rural roads, and eventually, the moving truck and the semi-trailer became stuck in mud.Â  The authorities then decided to end the undercover operation.Â \r\n \r\nWhile the Thunderbird managed to escape, Appellants and DeLeon were arrested at the scene.Â  A search of the semi-trailer revealed substantial amounts of marijuana.Â  However, the cargo portion of the moving truck was completely empty.Â  The authorities discovered rental paperwork inside the moving truck that showed Appellant Guerrero had rented the moving truck on May 17, 2002.\r\nOn March 22, 2004, an Edgefield grand jury indicted Appellants and DeLeon for trafficking approximately nine-hundred pounds of marijuana.Â  A trial was held June 28 through July 6, 2004. Â At the conclusion of the Stateâ€™s case, counsel for Appellants moved for directed verdicts, claiming the State had proved no more than Appellantsâ€™ mere presence at the scene and had failed to prove knowledge, a required element to convict a person for trafficking in marijuana. Â \r\nThe trial court denied Appellantsâ€™ motions for directed verdicts. Â Appellants later renewed these motions at the conclusion of DeLeonâ€™s case, which the trial court again denied.Â  A jury found Appellants guilty of trafficking in marijuana, and the trial court sentenced Appellants to twenty-five years imprisonment.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the denial of a directed verdict in a criminal case, this Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State. Â State v. Curtis, 356 S.C. 622, 633, 591 S.E.2d 600, 605 (2004). Â When ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.Â  State v. Cherry, 361 S.C. 588, 593, 606 S.E.2d 475, 477-78 (2004).\r\nIf there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, this Court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury. Â State v. Harris, 351 S.C. 643, 653, 572 S.E.2d 267, 273 (2002).Â  On the other hand, a defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged. Â State v. McKnight, 352 S.C. 635, 642, 576 S.E.2d 168, 171 (2003).Â  Similarly, the trial court should grant a directed verdict when the evidence merely raises a suspicion that the accused is guilty. Â State v. Zeigler, 364 S.C. 94, 102, 610 S.E.2d 859, 863 (Ct. App. 2005). \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants argue the State presented evidence that they were present when the marijuana was seized, but it failed to establish they knowingly attempted to possess the marijuana at issue.Â  Consequently, Appellants contend the trial court erred in failing to direct verdicts of not guilty for trafficking in marijuana.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n \r\nSection 44-53-370 of the South Carolina Code (1976 &amp; Supp. 2006) defines trafficking in marijuana as:Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\t(e) Any person who knowingly sells, manufactures, cultivates, delivers, purchases, or brings into this State, or who provides financial assistance or otherwise aids, abets, attempts, or conspires to sell, manufacture, cultivate, deliver, purchase, or bring into this State, or who is knowingly in actual or constructive possession \r\n\tor who knowingly attempts to become in actual or constructive possession of:\r\n\t(1) ten pounds or more of marijuana is guilty of a felony which is known as \r\n\tâ€œtrafficking in marijuanaâ€ and, upon conviction, must be punished as follows if the quantity involved is:\r\n\tÂ . . . (b) one hundred pounds or more, but less than two thousand pounds, or one hundred to one thousand marijuana plants regardless of weight, a mandatory term of imprisonment of twenty-five years, no part of which may be suspended nor probation granted, and a fine of twenty-five thousand dollars . . . .\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â   \r\nIn drug cases, our Supreme Court has recognized that the element of knowledge is seldom susceptible of direct proof, so it may be proven by circumstantial evidence. Â See State v. Attardo, 263 S.C. 546, 550, 211 S.E.2d 868, 869 (1975) (holding that in prosecution for knowing or intentional possession of controlled substances, knowledge can be proven by evidence of acts, declarations, or conduct of the accused from which the inference may be drawn that the accused knew of the existence of the prohibited substance). Knowledge is generally a question for the jury. Â Id.\r\nThe Appellantsâ€™ behavior and actions while at Billyâ€™s Super Store were markedly suspicious, and the ensuing course of events was inconsistent with what a reasonable delivery of furniture would entail. Â First, the Thunderbird drove past the semi-trailer and then out of the customs agentâ€™s sight before stopping at Billyâ€™s Super Store, apparently to ensure that it was safe to proceed with the delivery.Â  The Thunderbird returned with the moving truck only after first driving past the undercover agent.Â  The agent testified that the moving truck and the Thunderbird proceeded to block the semi-trailer, which precluded the semi-trailer from moving in any direction.Â  The Thunderbirdâ€™s driver then conversed with Appellants while the Thunderbirdâ€™s passenger instructed the undercover agents to follow them to a rural area where Appellants would unload the semi-trailer. Â Although all parties were at Billyâ€™s Super Store where it was clearly more practical to unload the furniture, Appellants still attempted to move the furniture to a more rural and less visible location.Â  These actions were inconsistent with transporting furniture as the moving truck was completely empty and contained sufficient room to transport the furniture from Billyâ€™s Super Store to its final destination.Â \r\n \r\nAll of these actions, while not direct proof of a knowing attempt to possess marijuana, formed substantial circumstantial evidence to send the case to the jury, as Appellantsâ€™ actions and behavior were inconsistent with the seemingly innocuous task of unloading furniture.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in refusing to direct verdicts in Appellantsâ€™ favor.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAlthough we recognize the State presented minimal, if any, direct evidence at trial to show Appellants knew the semi-trailer contained marijuana, we find Appellantsâ€™ actions and behavior during the undercover operation constituted substantial circumstantial evidence so as to require the caseâ€™s submission to the jury.Â  For the reasons stated herein, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.[1]Â  \r\nHUFF, BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-184","title":"State v.

Carrigg, Jr., Mark Weston Hardee, Peter Demos Protopapas, all of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this medical malpractice action, Dr. Eric Lewkowiez appeals the trial courtâ€™s refusal to direct a verdict or a judgment notwithstanding the verdict in his favor.Â  Dr. Lewkowiez contends the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to prove to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that his alleged breach of the standard of care proximately caused Peggy Saltersâ€™ injuries.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThis appeal concerns a series of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatments Salters received as a result of severe depression. Â Salters first received ECT treatments in the late 1980â€™s when medication did not seem to alleviate her depression.Â  Her physician at the time, Dr. John Emerick, recommended ECT treatments.Â  Dr. Emerick noted as the ECT treatments progressed Salters became less depressed, more organized, and less suicidal.Â  Â Â Â Â Â She again underwent treatments in 1990, and the ECT appeared to lessen her symptoms.Â  From 1992-99 Salters had no psychiatric history.\r\n \r\nIn 1998, Salters received a Masters of Science in Nursing and, in 1999, became certified as a nurse practioner.Â  During this time, Salters experienced the deaths of several close family members, most notably, the death of her husband in October 1999.Â  These deaths had a severe effect on Saltersâ€™ mental health and she again sought psychiatric care. Â Â \r\nOn August 8, 2000, she met with Dr. Lewkowiez. Â At their first meeting, he found Salters was tearful, had low energy, and had trouble sleeping.Â  Salters informed him she had a poor appetite, and in fact, had lost forty pounds since her husbandâ€™s death.Â  Dr. Lewkowiez diagnosed Salters with major depression, recurrent and severe.Â  He also believed she suffered from passive suicidal ideation, which is a condition describing people who have suicidal thoughts but no plans to implement suicide.Â  Dr. Lewkowiez recommended numerous anti-depressant drugs as part of Saltersâ€™ treatment.Â  Â Â \r\nBetween September 13 and Saltersâ€™ next appointment with Dr. Lewkowiez on October 2, Salters called Dr. Lewkowiez from Salt Lake City, Utah and informed him it was her intention to commit suicide, however, after they spoke, Salters changed her mind.Â  The antidepressants appeared to have no effect on Salters and she was unable to function at work.Â  Therefore, when she next saw Dr. Lewkowiez, he broached the subject of ECT because the procedure had been effective in the past.Â  This was the first time Dr. Lewkowiez had ever recommended a patient for ECT and he referred Salters to Dr. Robert Schnackenberg. Â Â Dr. Lewkowiez spoke to Dr. Schnackenberg and they examined her past medical records â€œextensively,â€ including her history of ECT.Â  Both doctors felt she was an appropriate candidate for the procedure.\r\nDr. Schnackenberg administered ECT on October 9, 11, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, and 27, 2000, and on November 3, 10, and 17, 2000.Â  Â The first set of treatments were spaced conventionally, and given every other day.Â  The following two weeks Dr. Schnackenberg administered what are referred to in the medical community as intensive or regressive ECTsâ€”which are ECTs administered daily.Â  The ECT treatments Dr. Schnackenberg administered in November were considered maintenance ECT which continued the effects of the previously administered ECTs.\r\nOn October 10, 2000, on Saltersâ€™ outpatient ECT record, a notation made by one of the nurses provided: â€œfaxed to Dr. Lewkowiez 10/11/00 at 1:10 p.m.â€Â  Ten days later on October 20, a notation on the outpatient record provided: â€œOffice Rosa notified at 3:35 she states Dr. Lewkowiez called and he will check on patient today.â€Â  Although both of these medical records seem to suggest Dr. Lewkowiez had contact with Salters, he denied having any contact with her until November, after the intensive ECTs had already been administered.\r\nOn November 2, Dr. Lewkowiez met with Salters.Â  His notes from their meeting show that Salters missed an ECT the previous Monday and that she had memory difficulties.Â  However, Dr. Lewkoweiz did not recommend she stop the ECT and, in fact, Dr. Schnackenbergâ€™s records suggest he encouraged her to continue with the ECT.Â  Moreover, he did not inform Dr. Schnackenberg about Salters memory complaints. Â Â On November 13, they met again and Dr. Lewkowiez noted Salters had â€œcontinued difficultyâ€ with her memory and that she was unable to function at work or home.Â  Additionally, Salters was losing weight and unable to sleep.Â  On November 30, Dr. Lewkowiez observed Salters continued â€œto be confused and disoriented.â€Â  At this point, Salters decided to stop the ECT because she was â€œcompletely unable to function.â€Â  Â \r\nAfter Salters stopped the ECT treatments, her memory problems did not subside.Â Â  She continued to see Dr. Lewkowiez and he recommended she go on disability.Â  He did not believe she had the ability to pay attention, listen and do what was necessary to treat patients.Â  Eventually, Dr. Lewkowiez recommended Salters see psychologist Dr. Mary Elizabeth Shea for memory loss secondary to ECT. Â In Dr. Sheaâ€™s opinion, Salters suffered memory loss as a result of the ECT treatments.\r\nSalters filed suit against Dr. Lewkowiez, Dr. Schnackenberg, Dr. Huggins, as well as Columbia Psychiatric Associates, P.A.,[2] and Palmetto Baptist Hospital,[3] alleging the physicians were liable for memory loss she sustained following a course of negligent treatment for severe depression that included ECT.Â  At trial, Salters offered expert testimony to establish the negligence of these physicians proximately caused her memory loss.Â  At the close of the evidence, the physicians moved for a directed verdict.Â  Dr. Lewkowiez argued he did not breach the standard of care, moreover, any alleged breach did not proximately cause Saltersâ€™ injuries.Â  The trial court denied the motion.Â  After trial, the jury found in favor of Dr. Huggins and Dr. Schnackenberg and found in favor of Salters against Dr. Lewkowiez for medical negligence in the amount of $625,177.00 in actual damages.Â  After the verdict, Dr. Lewkowiez filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a new trial, which the trial court denied.Â  This appeal followed.Â \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen ruling on a motion for a directed verdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the trial court must â€œview the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motions.â€ Sabb v. S.C. State University&nbsp; 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236&nbsp;(2002).Â  â€œIf the evidence as a whole is susceptible to more than one reasonable inference, a jury issue is created and the motion should be denied.â€Â  Martasin v. Hilton Head Health Sys., 364 S.C. 430, 437, 613 S.E.2d 795, 799 (Ct. App. 2005) (citation omitted). \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nLewkowiez argues the trial court erred in not granting a directed verdict or a judgment notwithstanding the verdict because Salters failed to present sufficient evidence to establish the requisite causal connection between Lewkoweizâ€™s alleged breach of the standard of care and Saltersâ€™ injury.Â  Specifically, Lewkowiez argues his alleged breach of the standard of care could not be the proximate cause of Saltersâ€™ injuries because her expert testified the intensive ECT caused Saltersâ€™ disabilities and Dr. Lewkoweiz did not meet with her until after that part of the treatment was over.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn South Carolina, a physician commits malpractice by failing to exercise the requisite degree of skill and learning generally possessed and exercised by other members of the medical profession acting in a similar situation or circumstance.Â  David v. McLeod Regional Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 247, 626 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2006).Â  A plaintiff in a medical malpractice action must first establish by expert testimony, unless the subject matter is of such common knowledge that no special testimony is needed, â€œevidence of the generally recognized practice and procedures that would be exercised by competent practitioners in a defendant doctorâ€™s field of medicine under the same or similar circumstances. Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., 326 S.C. 248, 254, 487 S.E.2d 596, 599 (1997) (citation omitted).Â  Secondly, the plaintiff must show the defendant physicianâ€™s departure from the generally accepted medical standards and procedures.Â  Id. \r\n \r\nFurther, â€œit is incumbent on the plaintiff to establish proximate cause as well as the negligence of the physician.â€Â  Ellis v. Oliver, 323 S.C. 121, 125, 473 S.E.2d 793, 796 (1996) (citation omitted).Â  As the South Carolina Supreme Court noted in Ellis, â€œnegligence may be deemed a proximate cause only when without such negligence the injury would not have occurred or could have been avoided.â€Â  323 S.C. at 125, 473 S.E.2d at 795.Â  A party relying solely on expert testimony to establish proximate cause between the physicianâ€™s negligence and the plaintiffâ€™s injury, must introduce evidence the physicianâ€™s negligence â€œmost probably resulted in the injuries alleged.â€Â  Gooding, 326 S.C. at 254, 487 S.E.2d at 599.Â  â€œHowever, in determining whether particular evidence meets the â€˜most probablyâ€™ test, it is not necessary the testifying expert actually use the words â€˜most probably.â€™â€Â  Martasin v. Hilton Head Health Sys., 364 S.C. 430, 438, 613 S.E.2d 795, 800 (Ct. App. 2005) (citation omitted).Â  As long as the expertâ€™s testimony is such â€œas to judicially impress that the opinion . . . represents his professional judgment as to the most likely one among the possible causesâ€ the testimony will be deemed sufficient to establish proximate cause.Â  Baughman v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel., 306 S.C. 101, 111, 410 S.E.2d 537, 543 (1991) (citation omitted). \r\n \r\nIn this case, Saltersâ€™ presented the testimony of Dr. Peter Breggin, a psychiatrist and an expert in ECT to establish the standard of care for attending psychiatrists who continue to care for their patients after referring the patient to a specialist.Â  Dr. Breggin testified as to the duties of attending and treating physicians for when patients develop severe cognitive side effects.Â  Â Dr. Breggin testified Dr. Lewkowiez and Dr. Schnackenberg had a duty to â€œreview and adjust the treatment technique being used, (e.g., switching to unilateral ECT, lowering the electric dose administered, and/or increasing the time interval between the treatments).â€Â  \r\n\r\nDr. Breggin opined in this particular case that the standard of care required Dr. Lewkowiez to communicate to Dr. Schnackenberg the side effects the ECT treatments were having on Salters.Â  According to Dr. Breggin, Dr. Lewkoweizâ€™s medical records indicated Salters was experiencing memory problems and that her personality had drastically changed.Â  However, Dr. Lewkowiez did not inform Dr. Schnackenberg of these changes; rather, Dr. Schnackenbergâ€™s medical records show Dr. Lewkowiez encouraged Salters to continue with the treatments.Â  Based on his review of the medical records, Dr. Breggin concluded Dr. Lewkowiez deviated from the standard of care by not stopping the ECT treatments after he saw Saltersâ€™ change in personality.Â  Â Further, Dr. Breggin stated he believed Saltersâ€™ disability was caused by the intensive ECT treatments.Â  He elucidated:\r\n\r\n\tItâ€™s cumulative.Â  We see her having some memory loss and cognitive problems from the first ECTs; and then from the later ECTs. But she keeps recovering and going back to work and functioning on a high level; and finally sheâ€™s tipped over by the accumulation and the intensive ECT.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nEven if the only evidence of causation was Dr. Bregginâ€™s testimony, when viewed in a light most favorable to Salters, a jury could have inferred the cumulative effect of the intensive and maintenance ECT treatments were the proximate cause of her injuries, and had Dr. Lewkowiez informed Dr. Schnackenburg of the changes Salters was experiencing, the treatments would have stopped.Â \r\n \r\nDr. Lewkowiez maintains that because he did not see Salters until after Dr. Schnackenberg had administered the intensive ECTs, when the damage to Salters had already occurred, his alleged breach of the standard of care described by Dr. Breggin could not be the proximate cause of the injuries.Â  First, as noted above, there is evidence in the record from which the jury could have inferred the cumulative effect of the ECT treatments caused Saltersâ€™ injuries.Â  Secondly, assuming only the intensive ECT did cause Saltersâ€™ injuries a reasonable jury could have found the medical records dated October 10 and 20 show that Dr. Lewkoweiz did check to see how Salters was tolerating the ECT.\r\n \r\nDr. Lewkoweiz points to the South Carolina Supreme Courtâ€™s recent decision in David v. McLeod Regional Medical Center, to support his proposition that Salters failed to establish how the facts of the case would have been different had Dr. Lewkoweiz informed Dr. Schnackenberg that Saltersâ€™ personality had drastically changed and she was suffering from severe memory loss. In David, unlike the situation presented here, the supreme court found the appellant provided no evidence how his injuries would have been different had the physician communicated his thoughts for treatment to the pathologist:Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\tStated differently, Dr. Fristâ€™s affidavit fails to explain how Dr. Brussettâ€™s post-diagnosis treatment would have affected the pathologistâ€™s initial diagnosis of the tumor.Â  As a result, there is no evidence that Dr. Brussettâ€™s failure to communicate Appellants possible treatment options with the pathologist was the proximate cause of Appellantsâ€™ injuries.\r\n\r\n367 S.C. at 249, 626 S.E.2d at 4. Â We also note in David the appellant failed to provide the standard of care the physicians allegedly breached.Â  Id.Â  In this case, not only did Dr. Breggin testify regarding the standard of care, his testimony provided the jury with evidence on the effect Dr. Lewkowiez breach had upon Salters.Â  Dr. Breggin testified that Dr. Lewkowiez â€œdid nothing to stop the ECT . . . thereâ€™s the report of the memory problems and the change is fairly obvious and he did nothing to interfere at that point.â€Â Â  Further, Dr. Breggin testified Dr. Lewkowiez should have called Dr. Schnackenberg and informed him of Saltersâ€™ reaction to the procedure.Â  We find there is ample evidence that as a result of Dr. Lewkowiezâ€™s failure to inform Dr. Schnackenberg of Satlersâ€™ reaction to the procedure, she was exposed to additional ECT treatments.Â  Viewing the totality of the evidence, we conclude a jury could have found Salersâ€™ injuries were most probably the result of Dr. Lewkowiezâ€™s breach of the standard of care.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in failing to grant a directed verdict or a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\r\n \r\nNext, Dr. Lewkowiez argues the trial court erred in finding he had a duty to monitor Saltersâ€™ progress because the issue was not presented at trial nor mentioned in the complaint.Â  Although the words â€œduty to monitorâ€ may not have been uttered during the course of the trial, when reviewing Dr. Bregginâ€™s testimony it is clear the duty to communicate is essentially the duty to monitor.Â  Further, because of the disposition of the first issue, there is no need to address this argument.\r\nDr. Lewkowiez also contends the trial court erred by finding him liable under a vicarious liability theory.Â  The trial court did not charge the jury regarding vicarious liability nor is there any evidence in the record that such a theory was presented at trial.Â  Accordingly, this argument has no merit. \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find sufficient evidence upon which a jury could conclude Dr. Lewkowiezâ€™s breach of the standard of care proximately caused Saltersâ€™ injuries.Â  Accordingly, the order of the trial court is\r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, KITTREDGE, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Salters alleges Lewkowiez and Schnackenberg are members of Columbia Psychiatric Associates but the record is unclear on this point.\r\n[3] During the course of the trial, Salters settled with Palmetto Baptist Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-188","title":"Poston v.

Williams, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-189\r\nSubmitted April 2, 2007 â€“ Filed April 24, 2007Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tFrederick James Newton, of Summerville, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tFrank M. Cisa, of Mt. Pleasant, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â RenÃ© McMasters brought this action against Jody E. Charpia to set aside a deed of property to Charpia from Charpiaâ€™s husband, Howard, on the basis it was a fraudulent conveyance.Â  The conveyance was made at a time when McMasters had litigation pending against Charpiaâ€™s husband.Â  The circuit court granted summary judgment to McMasters, finding the deed should be set aside pursuant to the Statute of Elizabeth, codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-23-10(A) (2007).Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn June 2002, McMasters sued Charpiaâ€™s husband, seeking money damages for alleged construction defects in a new home located in North Charleston, South Carolina.[2]Â  Charpiaâ€™s husband was the builder.[3]Â   \r\nBy deed dated November 5, 2003, Charpiaâ€™s husband transferred title to the partiesâ€™ marital residence to Charpia.Â  The deed was recorded in the Office of the Register of Mesne Conveyances for Dorchester County on December 30, 2003.Â  According to the deed, the transfer was â€œin consideration of the sum of ONE and no/100 DOLLAR ($1.00), this being a deed of gift and the full consideration paid by my wife Jody E. Charpia, the Grantee, on the delivery of this deed . . . .â€Â  At the time of this transfer, McMasterâ€™s lawsuit against Charpiaâ€™s husband for alleged construction defects was still pending.Â  Â Â \r\nIn August 2004, McMasters obtained a judgment of $191,600.00 against Charpiaâ€™s husband in the Court of Common Pleas for Dorchester County on her original action for alleged construction deficiencies.[4]Â  McMasters filed an action for fraudulent conveyance against Charpia in September 2004.Â  McMasters asked that the conveyance of property to Charpia be set aside based on the Statute of Elizabeth, which provides that transfers of property to creditors or others to avoid a suit or debt shall be deemed void.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-23-10(A) (2007).\r\nIn November 2005, McMasters filed a motion requesting summary judgment.Â  She asserted no genuine issues of material fact were in dispute in this action and she was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Â Â \r\nAfter a hearing, the circuit court granted the motion for summary judgment and set aside the conveyance pursuant to the Statute of Elizabeth.Â  The court stated McMasters would be allowed to seek levy and execution upon the residence in satisfaction, or partial satisfaction, of the judgment she had obtained.Â  Â Â \r\nIn setting aside the conveyance, the circuit court found the residence transferred to Charpia was worth somewhere between $140,000.00 and $150,000.00, was not encumbered by a mortgage, â€œwas clearly a gift,â€ and â€œwas conveyed at a time when Charpiaâ€™s husband was aware of the claim being asserted by McMasters.â€Â  Although the court found there was no actual intent to defraud, it concluded no actual intent was required since the conveyance was not supported by valuable consideration.Â \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Charpia contends the circuit court erred (1) in determining the conveyance of property from her husband should be set aside pursuant to the Statute of Elizabeth because this provision is inapplicable; and, (2) even assuming the statute applies, the court erred in finding that the conveyance was not supported by valuable consideration.\r\n\r\n\tThe Statute of Elizabeth provides in relevant part as follows:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(A)Â  Every gift, grant, alienation, bargain, \r\n\t\ttransfer, and conveyance of lands, . . . goods and chattels or any of them, . . . which may be had or made . . . for any intent or purpose to delay, hinder, or defraud \r\n\t\tcreditors and others of their just and lawful actions, suits, debts, accounts, damages, penalties, and forfeitures must be deemed and taken (only as against that person or persons, his or their heirs, successors, executors, administrators and assigns . . . ) to be clearly and utterly void . . . and of no effect, . . . any other matter or thing to the contrary notwithstanding.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-23-10(A) (2007) (emphasis added).\r\nCharpia first â€œasserts that the Statute [of Elizabeth] is inapplicable to the transfer because [McMasters] was not a creditor of Howard W. Charpia at the time of the transfer of the property.â€Â  Specifically, she argues that when the transfer of property occurred in 2003, McMasters had not yet obtained a judgment against her husband; therefore, McMasters was, â€œ[a]t best, . . . a potential future creditor at the time of the transferâ€ because her husband owed no debt to McMasters.Â \r\n \r\nWe find no merit to this assertion.Â  The statute itself expressly provides that it applies to the transfer of property â€œfor any intent or purpose to delay, hinder, or defraud creditors and others of their just and lawful actions, suits, debts, accounts, [and] damages . . . .â€Â  Id. Â§ 27-23-10(A) (emphasis added).\r\nOur supreme court has specifically held, based on the statuteâ€™s express language, the Statute of Elizabeth â€œdoes not limit its application to judgment creditors.Â  Rather, its protection extends to other types of partiesâ€ affected by the conveyance of the property.Â  Lebovitz v. Mudd, 293 S.C. 49, 52, 358 S.E.2d 698, 700 (1987).Â Â  Â Â \r\nCharpia next contends that, even if the statute is applicable, the â€œcourt erred in finding that the conveyance to [her] was not supported by valuable consideration.â€Â  She asserts she actually paid her husband the sum of one dollar that was recited in the deed.Â  Further, she asserts small sums or deeds citing â€œlove and affectionâ€ provide sufficient consideration under our case law, and even though the deed did not state the consideration was for â€œlove and affection, it is implicit in the familial relationship between [Charpia and her husband] by virtue of the bonds of holy matrimony.â€Â \r\n \r\nOur supreme court has held no actual intent to defraud need be shown when a transfer is not supported by valuable consideration:\r\n\r\n\tWe have held that under [the Statute of Elizabeth], conveyances shall be set aside under two conditions:Â  First, where the transfer is made by the grantor with the actual intent of defrauding his creditors where that intent is imputable to the grantee, even though there is a valuable consideration; and, second, where a transfer is made without actual intent to defraud the grantorâ€™s creditors, but without consideration.Â  . . .Â Â  If the transfer was not made on a valuable consideration, no actual intent to hinder or delay creditors needs be proven.\r\n\r\nWindsor Props., Inc. v. Dolphin Head Constr. Co., 331 S.C. 466, 470-71, 498 S.E.2d 858, 860 (1998).Â  When there are intra-family transfers, the law imposes a burden on the transferee to establish by clear and convincing evidence that there was both a valuable consideration and a bona fide transaction.Â  Id. at 471, 498 S.E.2d at 860-61.Â  \r\n \r\nIn Windsor, which involved a transfer of property from a husband to his wife, our supreme court found there was insufficient evidence of consideration where (1) the deed transferring the property recited there was â€œ[f]ive dollars and no other consideration,â€ but the attorney who prepared the deed could not recall money changing hands; and (2) the recipient testified consideration existed in the form of thousands of dollars advanced for the purchase, but there was no documentary evidence of these payments in the record other than a chart written by the recipient listing her alleged contributions.Â  Id. at 471-72, 498 S.E.2d at 860-61.\r\nThe supreme court noted the burden was on the recipient to establish the payment of valuable consideration.Â  Id. at 471, 498 S.E.2d at 860-61.Â  Moreover, the court stated the focus of the Statute of Elizabeth is on whether the grantor has reserved enough assets to satisfy his obligations, not just at the time of the transfer, but also at the time creditors are able to collect their indebtedness in full.Â  Id. at 473, 498 S.E.2d at 861-62; see also Gardner v. Kirven, 184 S.C. 37, 191 S.E. 814 (1937).\r\nAs the recipient of an intra-family transfer from her husband, the burden was on Charpia to establish the payment of valuable consideration within the meaning of the statute.Â  Although the deed to Charpia recited a consideration of $1.00 for the property transferred to her by her husband, by her own calculation, the property was worth anywhere from $140,000.00 to $150,000.00 and was not encumbered by a mortgage.Â  Charpia maintained she paid the dollar to her husband, but otherwise the transfer was a gift. Â Charpia acknowledged that the transfer left her husband with no substantial assets in his name.Â  In addition, both Charpia and her husband, as well as the attorney who prepared the deed, knew McMastersâ€™s lawsuit was pending at the time of the transfer.Â  We believe the only reasonable inference from the evidence is the conveyance was not supported by valuable consideration as required by the statute.Â  Further, the conveyance was voluntary and it left Charpiaâ€™s husband with no other assets to pay the obligation that had already accrued to McMasters (and was later reduced to judgment).\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find no error in the circuit courtâ€™s determination the deed to Charpia should be set aside on the basis the conveyance was made in violation of the Statute of Elizabeth.Â  See Fleming v. Rose,&nbsp;350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860&nbsp;(2002) (â€œWhen reviewing the grant of summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP.â€); Dennis v. McKnight, 161 S.C. 209, 159 S.E. 555&nbsp;(1931) (holding a complaint stated a cause of action for violation of the Statute of Elizabeth where a husband conveyed all of his property to his wife to secure the property in the event a judgment for wrongful death was later obtained against him); Albertson v. Robinson,&nbsp;371 S.C. 311, 638 S.E.2d 81&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006) (holding a husbandâ€™s transfer of the partiesâ€™ marital residence to his wife should be set aside pursuant to the Statute of Elizabeth, even though the creditorsâ€™ claim had not been reduced to judgment at the time of the transfer; the husband made the transfer at the time the claim was pending, he lacked other funds to pay the debt, and the only reasonable inference was the stated consideration was insufficient); Mathis v. Brown, 319 S.C. 261, 460 S.E.2d 406 (Ct. App. 1995) (stating where a transfer is not supported by valuable consideration, it will be set aside pursuant to the Statute of Elizabeth if the grantor was indebted to the creditor at the time of the conveyance, the conveyance was voluntary, and the grantor failed to retain sufficient assets to pay the indebtedness). \r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] In the caption of her complaint, McMasters stated the suit was against â€œCHARPIA RESIDENTIALS, LLC and HOWARD W.

Malloy McEachin, Jr., of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Summit Builders, Inc. appeals the trial courtâ€™s determination that it is equitably estopped from asserting the defense of statute of limitations, arguing the trial court erred in failing to grant a directed verdict based on the applicable statute of limitations and finding it was equitably estopped from asserting such defense.Â  We affirm.[1]Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nOn March 4, 1998, Summit Builders, as the general contractor, entered into a contract with Johnstone Supply, Inc. to construct a building in Murrellâ€™s Inlet, South Carolina.Â  Summit Builders began construction shortly thereafter, and work was completed on the building in the fall of 1999.Â  However, problems with the concrete floor began to surface in 1998.Â  A letter was sent on September 30, 1998, alerting Summit Builders that there was a problem with the concrete floor because there was too much organic material in it.Â  This problem was corrected shortly thereafter.Â \r\n \r\nHowever, additional problems with the concrete floor later developed.Â  Testimony showed that these problems were different than the problem corrected in 1998.Â  The later problems involved cracking and crumbling concrete making it unfit for its intended use.Â  There is conflicting evidence as to when these problems were discovered.Â  Some evidence showed these problems became noticeable in 2001.Â  Johnstone Supplyâ€™s Answers to Interrogatories stated that the problem at issue in the instant case was discovered sometime in 2000 by Jim Wood, a partner in Johnstone Supply.Â  At trial, Wood stated the problem began in 2001 but became a more serious issue in 2003.Â  However, in Woodâ€™s affidavit he indicates that the problem arose â€œin the spring or early summer of 2003.â€Â  The problems were mentioned to Summit Builders on several occasions and Summit Builders indicated that someone would take a look and see what needed to be done.Â  No repairs were ever made.Â  A letter dated June 5, 2003, noted that Johnstone Supply was making final payment but had concerns about the concrete floor.Â  The letter stated that final payment was only being made because of the warranty that had been provided.Â  Another letter dated August 5, 2003, indicated that the problem remained and requested Summit Builders make the repairs.Â \r\n \r\nOn February 24, 2004, Johnstone Supply commenced this lawsuit against Summit Builders for breach of contract and breach of warranty.Â  A bench trial was held on December 5, 2005.Â  After hearing counselsâ€™ arguments and the testimony of witnesses, the trial court denied Summit Buildersâ€™ motion for a directed verdict based on the applicable statute of limitations.Â  The trial court denied the motion based on its findings that Summit Builders was equitably estopped from asserting a statute of limitations defense because of its actions in failing to fix the concrete problem when they were repeatedly asked to look at the problem.Â  It is unclear from the record whether the trial court felt the Complaint was filed beyond the statute of limitations.Â  This appeal followed.Â \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSummit Builders argues the trial court erred in failing to grant a directed verdict based on the applicable statute of limitations.Â  However, in the record provided on appeal the only ruling of the trial court holds that Summit Builders was estopped from asserting the statute of limitations.[2]Â  Nowhere within the record before us is there a ruling by the trial court as to whether the statute of limitations had in fact expired on Johnstone Supplyâ€™s cause of action.Â  Summit Builders also contends the trial court erred in holding it was equitably estopped from asserting the defense of statute of limitations.Â  While the record indicates the trial judge ruled on the issue of estoppel, the record does not include the arguments raised by either party to the trial court.Â  Because of the deficiencies in the record before us, this court is unable to discern whether the trial judge ruled whether the statute of limitations had in fact expired, or whether the arguments advanced by Summit Builders on appeal were actually presented to the trial court.Â  Accordingly, we find these issues are not adequately preserved for review, and the record is insufficient to enable this court to make an intelligible review.Â  See In the Interest of Michael H., 360 S.C. 540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729, 732 (2004) (holding that issues must be raised and ruled upon in the trial court to be preserved for appellate review);Â  Taylor v. Taylor, 294 S.C. 296, 299, 363 S.E.2d 909, 911 (Ct. App. 1987) (providing â€œthe burden is on appellant to furnish a sufficient record on appeal from which this court can make an intelligent review.â€).\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\n\r\nHUFF, BEATTY, and CURETON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] All that is provided in the record as to the trial courtâ€™s final determination are two pages from the trial transcript.Â  The two pages from the trial transcript provide the trial courtâ€™s ruling as to estoppel but do not contain the arguments raised to the trial court prior to its ruling.Â  Further, there is no final written order provided in the record before this court.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-192","title":"State v.

Assaâ€™ad-Faltas, of Columbia, Pro\r\n\t\t\t\tSe.\r\n\t\t\t\tDana M. Thye, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Marie-ThÃ©rÃ¨se Assaâ€™ad-Faltas, M.D., M.P.H., appeals the circuit courtâ€™s decision to reverse the municipal courtâ€™s order granting her a new criminal trial.Â  We reverse.Â \r\n \r\nFACTS\r\nOn November 6, 2001, Faltas was arrested and charged with shoplifting after two Wal-Mart employees alleged they witnessed her remove several labels from multi-colored folders priced at $0.97 each.Â  The employees stated that Faltas replaced two labels on more expensive binders priced at either $4.97 or $3.97 each[1] with two of the $0.97 labels, and then she attempted to purchase the binders with the less expensive price labels on them.Â  A Polaroid photograph was purportedly taken of several multi-colored folders and the clear binders on the date of the incident.Â  Faltasâ€™s receipt showed that she purchased two â€œreport coversâ€ for $0.97 each with UPC numbers 007878799671.\r\n \r\nA few weeks prior to trial, Faltasâ€™s attorney was made aware of the existence of the photograph.Â  He immediately sent a somewhat insulting letter to the City requesting that he have immediate access to the photograph.Â  The City responded in a short letter indicating that the case would be called for trial in two weeks and that Faltasâ€™s attorney could make any pre-trial motions.Â  No motions were made concerning the photograph, and neither Faltas nor her attorney gained access to the photograph prior to trial.Â \r\n \r\nOn the date of the trial, Faltasâ€™s attorney moved to dismiss the shoplifting charge because:Â  the City did not have the original folders and binders from which Faltas was alleged to have switched labels; and the photograph of the purported items with switched labels mistakenly included the wrong binder, bringing into question whether Wal-Mart preserved the correct evidence.Â  The municipal court denied the motion to dismiss the charge and also denied Faltasâ€™s attorneyâ€™s motion to continue the case so he could appeal the denial of the motion to dismiss.[2]Â  The trial continued, with the City presenting the testimony of the two Wal-Mart employees who witnessed Faltas removing labels, the testimony of the arresting officer, and the introduction of the photograph.Â  According to a Wal-Mart employee who witnessed Faltasâ€™s actions, after the photograph was taken, the incorrect labels were removed from the binders and disposed of, and the binders were returned to the store shelves.Â  A police officer testified at trial that he saw the evidence against Faltas, including the photograph, prior to transporting Faltas to jail.Â \r\n \r\nFaltas testified at trial that she had previously returned two clear binders to Wal-Mart and had inadvertently attached the wrong labels to them prior to returning them.Â  When she was in Wal-Mart on the date of the incident, Faltas testified she decided to correct her error and switch the incorrect labels for correct labels.Â  She stated she actually switched less expensive labels for more expensive ones and that she went on to purchase completely different report covers with the appropriate labels attached.Â  Faltas was convicted of shoplifting and fined $500.Â  Her conviction was affirmed by both the circuit court and this court on appeal.Â  City of Columbia v. Faltas, Op. No. 2005-UP-00143 (S.C.Ct.App. dated Mar. 1, 2005).Â  On May 18, 2005, the case was remitted after the supreme court denied her petition for certiorari. Â \r\nFaltas moved before the municipal court for a new trial based on after-discovered evidence, and a hearing was held on May 23, 2005, before the same municipal judge who presided over her criminal trial.Â  Faltas had previously been allowed to make a copy of the photograph admitted into evidence during her trial.Â  Based on a digitally enlarged copy, she argued that the photograph was not taken at the time of her arrest but was instead fabricated by the Wal-Mart employees at a later time because, among other reasons: Â (1) stickers on the shelves in the background of the photograph were similar to the â€œNew Itemâ€ stickers used in 2002, indicating that the photograph was taken in 2002, not when Faltas was arrested in 2001; (2) the UPC symbols on the items in the photograph did not match the UPC symbols from the items she allegedly changed the labels on and purchased; and (3) the photograph was taken of items from the stationary aisle, not the arts and crafts aisle where Faltas obtained the binders she purchased.Â  Faltas also introduced Wal-Martâ€™s UPC manual that indicated that every item, including similar items of the same color, had a unique UPC symbol.Â  Because the folders shown in the photograph were of different colors, Faltas argued that the UPC numbers on the labels would have different numbers.Â  Thus, she argued, it was impossible that she took two labels from the different colored folders to put on the larger binders because her receipt showed she purchased two items with identical UPC numbers.Â  Â \r\nThe municipal court issued an order granting Faltasâ€™s motion for a new trial.Â  The municipal court found that Faltas â€œraised very serious and disturbing questions concerning the veracity of the testimony presented against her by the two Wal-Mart employees about the photograph.â€Â  The court noted that the photograph entered against her at her trial could not have been made at the time of her arrest because the â€œNew Itemâ€ stickers in the background were similar to the â€œNew Itemâ€ stickers Wal-Mart copyrighted in 2002.Â  The court found significant the fact that the colored folders would have two different UPC numbers and the items Faltas purchased had two identical UPC numbers.Â  The court found the evidence had been discovered after trial, and could not by due diligence have been discovered prior to trial, because Faltas was not allowed to review the photograph until trial and therefore could not have made the digital enlargement until after trial.Â  The court noted that where the original evidence was not retained and the City failed to make the photograph available to the defense until trial, despite Faltasâ€™s efforts to see it, â€œand where it is later shown that the photograph itself could not be what it has been purported by the prosecution to be, it may be said that the prosecutionâ€™s case is not merely impeached but thoroughly destroyed by the after discovered evidence.â€Â  The City appealed to the circuit court, arguing the municipal court made an error of law.\r\nFaltas complained to the circuit court that the City did not have the right to appeal the order granting her a new trial.Â  The circuit court determined that the City did have the right to appeal and that the appeal was not interlocutory.Â  After reviewing the motion for a new trial, the transcript of the hearing, the evidence presented at the 2004 criminal trial, the briefs submitted by both parties, the affidavit of trial counsel, and the order granting a new trial, the circuit court concluded that the municipal courtâ€™s order was in error and reversed the grant of a new trial.Â  The circuit court determined that the physical evidence presented at the hearing on the new trial motion â€œdid not lead to the conclusive resultâ€ that the municipal court believed it did.Â  The circuit court found that Faltas had the opportunity at her criminal trial to challenge the photograph or request a continuance in order to further review the photograph, but she failed to do so.Â  Relying on the new trial standards set forth in State v. Caskey, 273 S.C. 325, 256 S.E.2d 737 (1979), the court held:Â  (1) the evidence would not likely change the result of the trial; (2) Faltas had the evidence available to her on the date of her trial, thus it was not discovered after trial; (3) the photograph could have been â€œdiscoveredâ€ prior to trial because Faltasâ€™s trial counsel was made aware of the existence of the photograph two weeks prior to trial; and (4) the evidence was merely cumulative or impeaching.Â  The circuit court determined that the municipal court committed an error of law in granting a new trial, reversed the municipal courtâ€™s order, and reinstated Faltasâ€™s conviction.Â  Faltas appeals.\r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn criminal appeals from magistrate or municipal court, the circuit court does not conduct a de novo review, but instead reviews for preserved error raised to it by appropriate exception.â€Â  State v. Henderson, 347 S.C. 455, 457, 556 S.E.2d 691, 692 (Ct. App. 2001); S. C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-25-105 (Supp. 2006) (â€œThere shall be no trial de novo on any appeal from a municipal court.â€).Â  Thus, as with any appeal of a criminal case, the circuit court, in its appellate capacity, sits to review errors of law only and is bound by the factual findings of the trial court unless clearly erroneous.Â  See State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001) (holding that appellate courts in criminal cases only review errors of law and are bound by the factual findings of the trial court unless clearly erroneous).Â  This same scope of review applies to this court.Â  Id.; Henderson, 347 S.C. at 457, 556 S.E.2d at 692 (â€œIn reviewing criminal cases, this court may review errors of law only.â€).Â  \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nCiting Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573-75 (1985),[3] for the proposition that appellate courts are not to determine the factual issues de novo, Faltas argues the circuit court erred in finding that the municipal courtâ€™s determination was clearly erroneous.Â  We agree that the circuit court employed the wrong standard of review.[4]\r\nIt is well-settled that the granting of a new trial based upon after-discovered evidence is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court once the movant has made the requisite showing that the new evidence:Â  (1) would likely change the result if a new trial were granted; (2) was discovered since the trial; (3) could not have been discovered prior to trial by the exercise of due diligence; (4) is material to the issue of guilt or innocence; and (5) is not merely cumulative or impeaching.Â  Caskey, 273 S.C. at 329, 256 S.E.2d at 738-39; see State v. Pierce, 263 S.C. 23, 31, 207 S.E.2d 414, 418 (1974) (noting that whether to grant a new trial based upon after-discovered evidence is within the trial courtâ€™s discretion).\r\nAt the new trial hearing, Faltas:Â  submitted a digital enlargement of the photograph from trial; provided examples of Wal-Martâ€™s 2002 copyrighted â€œNew Itemâ€ stickers that were similar to the ones in the photograph; provided UPC codes from paper folders; described where the photograph was taken; and described the differences between the folders based on either angled or rounded edges or lack of outer clasps or prongs.Â  Faltas alleged that this evidence derived from the original photograph proved that the two Wal-Mart employees either were mistaken or that they fabricated their testimony and the photograph well after the date of her arrest.Â  Faltasâ€™s attorney also testified that, despite his repeated requests to see the photograph prior to trial, it was not provided to him.Â  Â Â Â \r\nThe municipal court was convinced that the digital enlargement of the photograph, and the evidence that was obtained as a result of the digital enlargement, constituted after-discovered evidence because Faltas was denied access to the photograph by the City.Â  Thus, despite her attorneyâ€™s efforts to gain access to the photograph, Faltas could not have made the enlargement until after she was given access to the photograph after trial.Â  On appeal, the circuit court reviewed each piece of evidence introduced at the new trial hearing and made findings as to whether each piece of evidence was believable or supported the theory Faltas used it for.Â  The circuit court then performed a new analysis of the evidence pursuant to Caskey.Â  This was error.Â  Whether or not the circuit court agreed with the factual findings made by the municipal court, there was evidence presented at the new trial hearing to support the factual findings and the circuit court was bound by them.Â  \r\n \r\nThus, looking at the evidence, it was irrelevant that the circuit court would have ruled differently from the municipal court.Â  The circuit court was bound by the municipal courtâ€™s factual findings and the inferences to be drawn therefrom.Â  Its power was limited to determining whether the municipal court made an error of law in granting the new trial, based on the facts as found by the municipal court.Â  Because there were facts to support the municipal courtâ€™s legal analysis of the new trial motion, we find the circuit court erred in reversing the grant of the motion for a new trial.Â  We are likewise bound by the municipal courtâ€™s factual findings and must employ the same scope of review as the circuit court was bound to employ.Â  Applying this scope of review, we find there was evidence to support the municipal courtâ€™s findings, and thus, the municipal court did not abuse its discretion in granting the new trial motion.[5]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause the circuit court erroneously conducted a de novo review of this matter, the circuit courtâ€™s order reversing the municipal courtâ€™s grant of a new trial and reinstating Faltasâ€™s conviction is\r\n \r\nREVERSED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The testimony is not clear as to whether the clear binders Faltas allegedly attempted to purchase were Plaid brand binders or Cardinal brand binders, each with a different price.\r\n \r\n[2]Â  Faltas fired her attorney after he called two witnesses, and Faltas completed the trial pro se.Â  \r\n \r\n[3]Â  Anderson, a United States Supreme Court case, discusses the appellate courtâ€™s role in federal cases to apply the clearly erroneous standard.Â  Anderson, 470 U.S. at 573-74 (â€œIf the . . . courtâ€™s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.â€).Â  As previously discussed, our state court cases hold a similar scope of review for circuit courts reviewing the findings of the municipal court or master-in-equity.Â \r\n \r\n[4] Â Faltas also argues that the circuit court applied the wrong standard by relying upon State v. Caskey, 273 S.C. 325, 256 S.E.2d 737 (1979), in determining whether she was entitled to a new trial.Â  She asserts that State v. Spann, 334 S.C. 618, 513 S.E.2d 98 (1999), effectively overruled Caskey, thus the circuit court relied upon the wrong standard.Â  Initially, it does not appear from the record that this matter was ever ruled upon by the circuit court.Â  This matter is not preserved for review.Â  State v. Hicks, 330 S.C. 207, 216, 499 S.E.2d 209, 214 (1998) (holding that an issue was not preserved for appellate review where it was not raised to or ruled upon by the trial court).Â  Further, both Spann and Caskey outline the five elements that a defendant must meet in order to obtain a new trial based on after-discovered evidence.Â  Thus, Spann does not overrule Caskey.Â  See Spann, 334 S.C. at 619-20, 513 S.E.2d at 99 (outlining the five elements for the granting of a new trial based on after-discovered evidence); Caskey, 273 S.C. at 329, 256 S.E.2d at 739 (same).\r\n[5] Â Faltas raises numerous other arguments on appeal, including:Â  (1) the City was not entitled to appeal the grant of a new trial; (2) the appeal of the grant of a new trial violated the double jeopardy clause; (3) the City waived its grounds for appeal; (4) the circuit court erred by requiring her to file her brief simultaneously with the Cityâ€™s without allowing her to respond to the brief and without holding a hearing on the merits; (5) the circuit court erred by requiring her, as the winning party before the municipal judge, to preserve additional sustaining grounds for appeal; and (6) the circuit court erred in finding the photograph was not after-discovered evidence.Â  Because we reverse this case based on the scope of review, we need not address Faltasâ€™s remaining issues on appeal.Â \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-194","title":"State v.

Gregory, Circuit Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-194\r\nSubmitted April 2, 2007 â€“ Filed April 26, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tAppellate Defender Eleanor Duffy Cleary, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Shawn L. Reeves, all of Columbia; and Solicitor I. McDuffie Stone, III, of Beaufort; for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  George W. Fickens was convicted of felony driving under the influence (DUI) and sentenced to sixteen years imprisonment.Â  He appeals, arguing the trial court erred in refusing to suppress the blood alcohol test results because the State failed to:Â  (1) establish a complete chain of custody; (2) comply with the videotaping and affidavit requirements of South Carolina Code section 56-5-2953 (2006); and (3) comply with Fickenâ€™s discovery request for proficiency tests relating to the SLED toxicologist.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 30, 2004, Janette Dunn called the Highway Patrol to alert them that a small black car was weaving in and out of traffic on the westbound lane of Highway 63 near Walterboro and nearly sideswiped her car.Â  After Dunn drove into the median to avoid being hit by the small black car, she continued westbound on the road behind the car.Â  The small black car continued weaving in and out of traffic in the westbound lane before it rounded a curve in the road.Â  When Dunn rounded the same curve, she saw that the small black car had collided with a white car on the shoulder of the eastbound lane.Â  The driver of the white car, Rosa Dopson, was trapped in the vehicle and suffered serious injuries to her face and forehead.Â  She was transported to the Medical University of South Carolina where she later died from blunt force trauma to the head.Â  The driver of the small black car, Fickens, was also trapped under the steering wheel of his car and had to be extricated by emergency personnel.Â Â \r\n \r\nLance Corporal Rich Riney of the South Carolina Highway Patrol was the first officer on the scene.Â  He testified that Fickensâ€™ passenger was unhurt but extremely intoxicated, and the passenger admitted to throwing a bottle of beer in the woods.[2]Â  Trooper Riney found two bottles of Budweiser in brown paper bags:Â  a mostly-consumed twenty-two ounce bottle on the driverâ€™s side floorboard and a freshly blood-stained bottle on the ground near Fickensâ€™ car.Â  According to Riney, Fickens smelled strongly of alcohol, his speech was slurred, and he was unable to communicate with anyone at the scene.Â  Paramedic Melissa Feathers, who treated Fickens at the scene, also testified that Fickensâ€™ clothes and breath smelled strongly of alcohol and Fickensâ€™s had slurred speech.Â Â \r\n \r\nFickens was transported to the hospital where, at the direction of Trooper Riney, Nurse Shannon Mayes drew Fickensâ€™ blood.Â  A blood alcohol test showed that Fickensâ€™ blood alcohol level was .277 percent.Â  Fickens was later charged with felony DUI.Â  Over his objections, the results of Fickensâ€™ blood alcohol test were admitted at trial.Â  This appeal followed his conviction.Â \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Chain of Custody\r\nFickens argues the trial court erred in admitting the blood alcohol test results because there was no evidence as to the identity of the person who took the blood evidence from Trooper Riney at the SLED headquarters and placed the evidence in the locked refrigerator.Â  Thus, Fickens argues, the State failed to establish a complete chain of custody.Â  We disagree.\r\n \r\nWhether to admit or exclude evidence is a decision within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  State v. Horton, 359 S.C. 555, 566, 598 S.E.2d 279, 285 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The courtâ€™s decision to admit evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Id.Â  Thus, this court looks to whether the trial courtâ€™s decision was controlled by an error of law or was without evidentiary support.Â  State v. Taylor, 360 S.C. 18, 23, 598 S.E.2d 735, 737 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œIf there is any evidence to support the trial judgeâ€™s decision, the appellate courts will affirm it.â€Â  Id. \r\n \r\nIn order to admit blood or other fungible evidence, the State must prove a complete chain of custody, as far as practicable, tracing possession of the evidence from the time it was taken until the time it was analyzed.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cochran, 364 S.C. 621, 628-29, 614 S.E.2d 642, 646 (2005) (â€œWe have consistently held complete chain of evidence must be established as far as practicable, tracing possession from the time the specimen is taken from the human body to the final custodian by whom it is analyzed.â€); State v. Carter, 344 S.C. 419, 424, 544 S.E.2d 835, 837 (2001) (â€œThe State must prove a chain of custody for a blood sample from the time it is drawn until it is tested.â€).Â  â€œThe evidence need not negate the most remote possibility of substitution, alteration, or tampering with the evidence, but rather must prove to a reasonable probability that the item is the same as, and not substantially different from, the object as it existed at the beginning of the chain.â€Â  Cochran, 364 S.C. at 629-30, 614 S.E.2d at 647.Â  Generally, our courts have found evidence inadmissible only where there is a missing link in the chain of possession because the identity of those who handled the blood was not established as far as practicable.Â  Carter, 344 S.C. at 424, 544 S.E.2d at 837; State v. Governor, 362 S.C. 609, 612, 608 S.E.2d 474, 475 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  However, our supreme court has recently noted that it has â€œnever held the chain of custody rule requires every person associated with the procedure be available to testify or identified personally, depending on the facts of the case.â€Â  Cochran, 364 S.C. at 629-30, 614 S.E.2d at 647.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nNurse Shannon Mayes testified that she drew Fickensâ€™ blood in Trooper Rineyâ€™s presence, placed the blood into an uncontaminated vial, sealed the vial, and gave the vial to Trooper Riney.Â  Mayes stated she then witnessed Riney place the vial in an evidence box which he then sealed.Â  Trooper Riney testified that he witnessed Nurse Mayes draw Fickensâ€™ blood and seal and initial the vial.Â  Riney stated that after he received the vial from Mayes, he sealed it in an evidence box and then drove it to the locked evidence refrigerator at the Walterboro Highway Patrol office.Â  Sergeant Brown opened the lock so Riney could place the box in the refrigerator, and then Brown locked it again.Â  Riney testified that the following day Sergeant Brown unlocked the refrigerator so that Riney could retrieve the box and take it to the SLED laboratory in Columbia.Â  According to Riney, the box was in the same condition as it was when placed in the refrigerator and was still sealed.Â \r\n \r\nRiney stated that once at SLED headquarters in Columbia, a SLED technician took the evidence, unsealed the Styrofoam container in his presence, placed the still-sealed vial of blood in a heat-sealed bag, and sealed the bag in Rineyâ€™s presence.Â  The SLED technician then had Riney place his initials over the heat seal, and Riney placed the evidence in the locked refrigerator under the SLED technicianâ€™s supervision.Â  SLED toxicologist Laurie Shacker testified that the sealed evidence bag was brought to her by someone in the toxicology department from the locked refrigerator and that it was not tampered with in any way prior to her testing it.Â  Â \r\nFickens objected to the admission of the blood alcohol test evidence, arguing the chain was not complete because the State did not present evidence of the identity of the person at SLED who took the evidence from the locked evidence refrigerator and gave it to Shacker.Â  The trial judge denied the motion.Â Â \r\n \r\nAlthough the identity of the SLED technician who transported the sealed blood evidence to Shacker was not identified, we believe the State established a sufficient chain of custody, as far as practicable, such that it proved, to a reasonable probability, that the blood was â€œthe same as, and not substantially different from, the [blood] as it existed at the beginning of the chain.â€Â  Cochran, 364 S.C. at 629-30, 614 S.E.2d at 647.Â  The blood vial was sealed by Nurse Mayes, maintained in the Highway Patrolâ€™s locked evidence refrigerator, transported to SLED by Trooper Riney while still in its orginial sealed condition, placed in another heat-sealed evidence bag at SLED and then placed by Trooper Riney in the evidence refrigerator, and then obtained by Shacker, still in its sealed condition and un-tampered with.Â  Thus, the State reasonably established a complete chain of possession and that the evidence was still in the same condition when it was tested as it was when originally obtained from Fickens in the hospital.\r\n \r\nFurther, as previously discussed, our state supreme court has recently noted that, depending on the circumstances of a particular case, the failure to identify one person involved in the chain of custody may not render the evidence inadmissiable.Â  In Cochran, the Department of Social Services sought the termination of a motherâ€™s parental rights based, in part, on her failure of two drug tests.Â  Mother complained that DSS failed to establish a complete chain of custody over her blood samples because the identity of the courier who transported the blood from the collection site to the testing facility was unknown.Â  The court noted evidence was presented that the vials were sealed at the collection site and arrived at the testing facility still in a sealed condition.Â  Cochran, 364 S.C. at 629, 614 S.E.2d at 646.Â  The court also noted that every person involved in actually testing the blood testified as to their handling of the samples.Â  Id.Â  The court held that, generally, â€œwe will uphold the chain of custody if the safeguards instituted ensure the integrity of the evidence, even if every person associated with the procedure is not personally identified.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nLike the court in the Cochran case, we believe the particular facts in the present case show that the chain of custody was sufficiently established to negate the possibility of tampering and to show that the evidence arrived in the same condition for testing as it was when it was taken from Fickens.Â  Accordingly, we find no error with the trial courtâ€™s decision to admit the blood evidence.Â \r\n \r\nII.&nbsp; Section 56-5-2953\r\nFickens argues that because Trooper Riney failed to videotape the incident and failed to submit an affidavit explaining why he failed to videotape the incident, the blood evidence should have been suppressed.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 56-5-2953 provides that a person suspected of violating the DUI laws must have his conduct videotaped at the incident site and the breath test site.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2953(A) (2006).Â  The section further provides that:\r\n\r\n\tNothing in this section may be construed as prohibiting the introduction of other evidence in the trial of a violation of [the DUI statutes.]Â  Failure by the arresting officer to produce the videotapes required by this section is not alone a ground for dismissal of any charge made pursuant to [the DUI statutes] if the arresting officer submits a sworn affidavit certifying that the videotape equipment at the time of the arrest, probable cause determination, or breath test device was in an inoperable condition, stating reasonable efforts have been made to maintain the equipment in an operable condition, and certifying that there was no other operable breath test facility available in the county or, in the alternative, submits a sworn affidavit certifying that it was physically impossible to produce the videotape because the person needed emergency medical treatment, or exigent circumstances existed. Further, in circumstances including, but not limited to, road blocks, traffic accident investigations, and citizensâ€™ arrests, where an arrest has been made and the videotaping equipment has not been activated by blue lights, the failure by the arresting officer to produce the videotapes required by this section is not alone a ground for dismissal. Â However, as soon as videotaping is practicable in these circumstances, videotaping must begin and conform with the provisions of this section. Â Nothing in this section prohibits the court from considering any other valid reason for the failure to produce the videotape based upon the totality of the circumstances; nor do the provisions of this section prohibit the person from offering evidence relating to the arresting law enforcement officerâ€™s failure to produce the videotape.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2953(B) (2006).Â   \r\nAt trial, Trooper Riney testified that he did not videotape the accident scene, nor did he submit an affidavit to explain the failure to videotape the scene.Â  Riney further testified that he could not have videotaped Fickens at the scene, considering: Â the position of Fickensâ€™ car after the accident; the fact that Fickens was trapped inside the car; and the inability to remove the patrol car camera and then take it to Fickensâ€™ car to film.Â  Fickens admitted before the trial court that although the remedy for the failure to videotape the incident â€œmay not be the dismissal of the case,â€ he argued that suppression of other evidence found at the scene, including the beer bottles and the testimony regarding the smell of alcohol, was warranted.Â  The trial court denied Fickensâ€™ motion.Â \r\n \r\nInitially, it does not appear that Fickensâ€™ argument is preserved for appellate review.Â  Although Fickens argued before the trial court that evidence found at the scene should be suppressed due Trooper Rineyâ€™s failure to comply with section 56-5-2953, Fickens did not argue the blood alcohol test evidence should be suppressed due to the failure to videotape the accident scene or submit an affidavit.Â  Thus, the argument that the blood alcohol test evidence should have been suppressed due to failure to comply with the statute was not raised to or ruled upon by the trial court and may not now be raised for the first time on appeal.Â  Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (holding that issues not raised to or ruled upon by the trial court are not preserved for appellate review); Bryant v. Waste Mgmt., Inc., 342 S.C. 159, 171-72, 536 S.E.2d 380, 387 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding that a party may not argue one ground at trial and an alternate ground on appeal).Â  \r\n \r\nIn any event, we find Trooper Rineyâ€™s failure to comply with the videotaping and affidavit portions of the statute did not warrant suppression of the blood alcohol test evidence.Â  The statute provides that the failure to produce a videotape â€œis not alone a ground for dismissal of any charge.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2953(B) (2006).Â  Thus, a clear reading of the statute provides possible dismissal of the charge due to failure to comply with the statute.Â  Nothing in the statute, however, provides for suppression of evidence as a remedy when the State fails to comply with the statute.Â  In fact, the opening sentence in subsection B explicitly provides that the statute must not be construed to prohibit the introduction of other evidence of intoxication.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2953(B) (2006).\r\n \r\nFurther, the statute allows the trial court to consider the totality of the circumstances in reviewing the arresting officerâ€™s failure to produce a videotape.Â  Id.Â  Reviewing the totality of the circumstances, there was evidence that Trooper Riney could not have videotaped Fickens based on the position of his car, the fact that Fickens was trapped in the car, and the fact that the camera was securely attached to Rineyâ€™s patrol car.Â  Considering the exigent nature of the accident and the other circumstances, we find Trooper Riney had a valid reason for failing to produce a videotape.Â  Â \r\nEven assuming the statute provides for exclusion of the blood alcohol evidence as a remedy for the Stateâ€™s failure to produce a videotape, we find the error would have been harmless.Â  Two witnesses saw Fickensâ€™ car weaving in and out of traffic prior to the accident.Â  Both Trooper Riney and the responding paramedic testified that Fickens smelled strongly of alcohol and was incoherent.Â  Two twenty-two ounce beer bottles were found on the scene.Â  Despite the fact that Fickens was driving in the westbound lane, the accident occurred with both Fickensâ€™ and the victimâ€™s cars off the shoulder in the eastbound lane.Â  This evidence would reasonably support Fickensâ€™ conviction for felony DUI without the blood alcohol evidence.Â  Thus, any error in admitting the blood alcohol evidence is harmless.Â  State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985) (holding that an error is harmless when it could not have reasonably affected the outcome of the trial).\r\nIII.Â  Failure to comply with discovery requests\r\nFickens argues that the State failed to provide the proficiency tests of SLED toxicologist Shacker pursuant to Fickensâ€™ Brady[3] motion.Â  Fickens asserts the trial court should have conducted a hearing because he made the threshold showing that the proficiency tests were material.Â  Therefore, Fickens argues, the trial court erred in admitting the blood alcohol evidence.Â Â  We disagree.Â \r\n \r\nTo comply with a Brady request for disclosure of exculpatory evidence, the State must disclose both impeachment and exculpatory evidence favorable to a defendant which is material to guilt or punishment.Â  United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 676 (1985); State v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 241, 471 S.E.2d 689, 693 (1996).Â  â€œEvidence is material under Brady if there is a reasonable probability that had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.â€Â  State v. Proctor, 358 S.C. 417, 421, 595 S.E.2d 476, 478 (2004).Â  Once a defendant makes the threshold showing that the evidence he seeks is material, the trial court should conduct a hearing.Â  Id. at 422, 595 S.E.2d at 478.Â  â€œFor Brady purposes, in determining the materiality of nondisclosed evidence, an appellate court must consider the evidence in the context of the entire record.â€Â  State v. Talyor, 333 S.C. 159, 177, 508 S.E.2d 870, 879 (1998). Â The court should not consider the sufficiency of the evidence, and it should only consider whether the appellantâ€™s right to a fair trial was impaired.Â  Proctor, 358 S.C. at 423, 595 S.E.2d at 479.Â  \r\n\r\nWe initially note that this argument is not preserved for appellate review.Â  Fickens complained to the trial court that, although he filed a discovery request for Shackerâ€™s proficiency tests, the State failed to turn them over to him.Â  Fickens argued that it rendered him unable to adequately cross-examine Shacker, and thus the blood test results should be suppressed.Â  Fickens never argued the failure to turn over the proficiency tests amounted to a Brady violation.Â  He also did not argue the tests were material or request a Brady hearing.Â  Thus, the Brady issue before us was never raised to or ruled upon by the trial court and is raised for the first time on appeal.Â  Staubes, 339 S.C. at 412, 529 S.E.2d at 546 (holding that issues not raised to or ruled upon by the trial court are not preserved for appellate review); Bryant, 342 S.C. at 171-72, 536 S.E.2d at 387 (holding that a party may not argue one ground at trial and an alternate ground on appeal).Â  \r\n \r\nEven assuming the Brady issue was adequately presented to the trial court, we find no error with the trial courtâ€™s actions.Â  Nothing in the record indicates that the State ever had possession of Shackerâ€™s proficiency tests or what Shackerâ€™s proficiency scores were.Â  Thus, it is impossible to determine whether the proficiency scores were material to Fickensâ€™ defense.Â  Nevertheless, Fickens was able to adequately cross-examine Shacker regarding the procedures used during the blood sample collection and testing.Â  Further, in light of all the other evidence presented at trial, we find any error in failing to suppress the alcohol blood tests due to an alleged Brady violation by the State would be harmless.Â  Mitchell, 286 S.C. at 573, 336 S.E.2d at 151 (holding that an error is harmless when it could not have reasonably affected the outcome of the trial); see Proctor, 358 S.C. at 424, 595 S.E.2d at 480 (finding that the nondisclosure of DNA proficiency test results was not material considering the fact that the other evidence was â€œformidableâ€). Â Â \r\nAccordingly, we find Fickensâ€™ right to a fair trial was not impaired and we find no error with the trial courtâ€™s decision to admit the blood alcohol test results.\r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause the trial court did not err in failing to suppress Fickensâ€™ blood alcohol test results, Fickensâ€™ conviction and sentence are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â The passenger was arrested for violating the open container law, littering, and public drunkenness.Â Â \r\n \r\n[3] Brady v.

Childs, all of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this tort action, John and Jane Doe[1] (the Does) appeal the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to Richland County School District Two (the School District) on their claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  We affirm.[2]\r\nFACTS\r\nDuring the 2001-2002 school year, the School District employed Cassius Rojas as a teacher.Â  Rojas taught math and coached the girlsâ€™ basketball team at Ridge View High School (Ridge View).Â  The Doesâ€™ minor daughter, KK, was a junior at Ridge View and manager of the girlsâ€™ basketball team. Â She was also Rojasâ€™ student aide.Â  At some point during the school year, Rojas and KK began to have a sexual relationship.Â  The two had sex on numerous occasions and often had sex while at Ridge View.Â \r\n \r\nOn July 29, 2002, while at a coachesâ€™ convention, Rojas confided to Coach Lynch, who was also employed at Ridge View, that he was having sex with a junior at the school.Â  Lynch, believing Rojasâ€™ confession to be â€œthe ramblings of a drunken man,â€ did not inform school officials until August 20, after the School District had discovered Rojasâ€™ misconduct.Â  \r\n \r\nOn August 16, 2002, around lunchtime, a student who was home changing clothes saw Rojas leaving KKâ€™s house.Â  KK lived near the school and was on â€œhomeboundâ€ status at the time.Â  When the student returned to school, he reported the information to the schoolâ€™s assistant principal.Â  Principal Sharon Buddin confronted Rojas, who initially denied being at KKâ€™s house.Â  Rojas averred he left his keys at the front desk of the school and went jogging in order to find a jogging route for the girlsâ€™ basketball team.Â  Although the jogging route took him by KKâ€™s residence, he denied going to the house.Â  According to KK, , Rojas called later that day to tell her Principal Buddin would be calling to discuss the allegations against him.Â  Rojas explained KK should lie and tell Principal Buddin he was not at her house.Â  On August 19, after repeatedly denying Rojasâ€™ presence at her house, KK eventually broke down in tears and confessed to a school guidance counselor.Â Â \r\n \r\nOn August 20, 2002, the School District placed Rojas on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation.Â  Soon after, officers arrested Rojas and he formally resigned from his teaching and coaching positions at Ridge View.Â  \r\n \r\nIn 2000, prior to the Rojas incident, another coach at Ridge View was accused of having a sexually inappropriate relationship with a female student.Â  During the same year, an administrator at the school was reprimanded for touching a studentâ€™s legs when demonstrating proper short lengths and for grabbing student IDs off studentsâ€™ chests instead of asking the students to hand over their IDs.Â Â  \r\n \r\nOn August 5, 2004, the Does and KK filed suit against the School District.[3]Â  The parties agreed to settle all of KKâ€™s claims, leaving only the Doesâ€™ claims against the School District.Â  On June 20, 2005, the School District moved for summary judgment on the Doesâ€™ claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent supervision. Â \r\nAfter a hearing on January 10, 2006, the trial court found the Does failed to identify any conduct by the School District so extreme and outrageous, that it exceeded all possible bounds of decency.Â  Accordingly, the trial court granted summary judgment to the School District on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.Â  However, the trial court denied the School Districtâ€™s motion with respect to the Doesâ€™ negligent supervision claim. This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).Â  Both the trial court and appellate courts apply the same standard when reviewing a summary judgment motion pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP: Â summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002). Â The evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id. at 494, 567 S.E.2d at 860.Â  \r\n \r\nThe party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary support for the opponentâ€™s case, and the non-moving party must show more than the allegations or denials contained in the pleadings.Â  Peterson v. W. Am. Ins. Co., 336 S.C. 89, 94, 518 S.E.2d 608, 610 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The non-moving party must come forward with specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.Â  Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 660, 582 S.E.2d 432, 438 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Does allege the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment on their claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress was an error of law.Â  The Does maintain the trial court erred in finding the School Districtâ€™s behavior was not extreme and outrageous.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina has long recognized â€œthat â€˜oneâ€™s wilful, malicious conduct proximately causing anotherâ€™s emotional distress may be actionableâ€™ as intentional infliction of emotional distress or the tort of outrage.â€Â  Williams v. Lancaster Sch. Dist., 369 S.C. 293, 305, 631 S.E.2d 286, 293 (Ct. App. 2006) (quoting Ford v. Hutson, 276 S.C. 157, 161, 267 S.E.2d 776, 778 (1981)).Â  To establish a claim for intentional infliction of distress, or outrage, a party must show: \r\n \r\n\r\n\t(1) the defendant intentionally or recklessly inflicted severe emotional distress or was certain or substantially certain that such distress would result from his conduct . . . ; (2) the conduct was so â€œextreme and outrageousâ€ as to exceed â€œall possible bounds of decencyâ€ and must be regarded as â€˜atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized communityâ€™ . . . ; (3) the actions of the defendant caused the plaintiffâ€™s emotional distress; and (4) the emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff was â€œsevereâ€ so that â€œno reasonable man could be expected to endure it.â€\r\n\r\nFolkens v. Hunt, 290 S.C. 194, 203, 348 S.E.2d 839, 844 (Ct. App. 1986) (quoting Ford, 276 S.C. at 162, 276 S.E.2d at 778)).Â  \r\n \r\nThe determination of â€œwhether a defendantâ€™s conduct may be reasonably regarded as so extreme and outrageous as to allow recovery is a question for the court to determine in the first instance.â€ Â Butts v. AVX Corp., 292 S.C. 256, 262-63, 355 S.E.2d 876, 880 (Ct. App. 1987); see Andrews v. Piedmont Air Lines, 297 S.C. 367, 371, 377 S.E.2d 127, 129 (Ct. App. 1989) (noting that question of whether a defendantâ€™s conduct may be reasonably regarded as so extreme and outrageous as to permit recovery for intentional infliction of emotional distress is question for the trial court to determine). Â After the initial showing is made that â€œconduct is shown which may be reasonably regarded as extreme and outrageous,â€ the matter should be submitted to the jury to determine â€œwhether the conduct complained of is, in fact, sufficiently extreme and outrageous to result in liability.â€Â  Fleming v. Rose, 338 S.C. 524, 537, 526 S.E.2d 732, 739 (Ct. App. 2000), revâ€™d on other grounds, 350 S.C. 488, 567 S.E.2d 857 (2002).Â  \r\n \r\nWith these considerations in mind, we turn to the case at hand.Â  To support their claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, the Does contend they suffered severe emotional distress due to the School Districtâ€™s failure to: Â (1) provide appropriate sexual harassment training to staff, students, and parents; and (2) follow mandatory federal guidelines.Â  \r\n \r\nOn the outset, we observe the Doesâ€™ arguments are not preserved for review.Â  To preserve an issue for appellate review, the issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.Â  See Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (â€œIt is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.â€).Â  \r\n \r\nAlthough the Does allege in their memorandum in opposition to summary judgment that the School District failed to follow federal guidelines and failed to provide appropriate sexual harassment training to staff, these issues were argued as part of the Doesâ€™ claim for negligence.Â  The Does did not raise these arguments in either their memorandum or at the hearing with respect to their claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  The trial court, in summarily denying the School Districtâ€™s motion for summary judgment as to the Doesâ€™ claim for negligence, presumably found the arguments persuasive on the issue of the School Districtâ€™s negligence.Â  However, it is clear from the trial courtâ€™s order that it did not consider these arguments with respect to the claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  The trial courtâ€™s order only refers to the Doesâ€™ allegations that the School District failed to provide them with written reports and failed to prevent Rojasâ€™ misconduct.Â  Thus, the trial court did not rule on the issues with regard to the claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  Additionally, the Does failed to make any Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion.Â  Therefore, the issues are not preserved for our review on appeal.Â  See Washington v. Washington, 308 S.C. 549, 551, 419 S.E.2d 779, 781 (1992) (holding when an appellant neither raises an issue at trial nor through a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to amend, the issue is not properly presented to an appellate court for review).Â  Accordingly, we decline to address the Doesâ€™ points of error on the above mention grounds.\r\nThe Does also contend the School Districtâ€™s failure to act preemptively to prevent the harm which occurred constituted extreme and outrageous behavior.Â  Specifically, the Does point to the School Districtâ€™s failure to follow school policies which they believe, if followed, would have prevented the abuse and the School Districtâ€™s failure to make any changes following the two sexual harassment incidents that preceded the Rojas incident.Â  The Does also argue the School Districtâ€™s actions after the Rojas incident occurred constituted extreme and outrageous behavior.Â  They allege that because the School District failed to act in a timely manner, upon Coach Lynchâ€™s knowledge of Rojasâ€™ sexual harassment, Rojas was able to further victimize KK.Â  They also argue the School District failed to appropriately discipline administrators for failing to prevent the abuse.Â  Additionally, they contend the School Distract failed to provide them with written follow-up reports in accordance with school policy. The Does maintain these failures constituted extreme and outrageous behavior on the part of the School District for which they are entitled to recover.\r\nSouth Carolina law limits claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress to egregious conduct toward a plaintiff proximately caused by the defendant.Â  See Upchurch v. N.Y. Times Co., 314 S.C. 531, 536, 431 S.E.2d 558, 561 (1993) (â€œIt is not enough that the conduct is intentional and outrageous.Â  It must be conduct directed at the plaintiff, or occur in the presence of a plaintiff of whom the defendant is aware.â€).Â  We note the record contains no evidence that the School District, in failing to take any preemptive action to prevent the abuse, targeted or directed any of its conduct towards the Does.Â  Further, no evidence suggests the School Districtâ€™s actions after discovering Rojasâ€™ misconduct was directed towards the Does.\r\nMoreover, even if the School Districtâ€™s actions could be construed as being directed toward the Does, we find the Does have not presented any factual allegations of the type of extreme or outrageous conduct committed by the School District that gives rise to a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  Viewed in a light most favorable to the Does, the School Districtâ€™s behavior in this instance is not sufficiently severe to rise to the level of conduct considered â€œso extreme and outrageous as to exceed all possible bounds of decency [that] must be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.â€Â  Upchurch, 314 S.C. at 536, 431 S.E.2d at 561.Â  The Does have shown â€œno hostile or abusive encounters, or coercive or oppressive conduct.â€Â  Gattison v. S.C. State College, 318 S.C. 148, 157, 456 S.E.2d 414, 419 (Ct. App. 1995) (finding although plaintiff alleged â€œunprofessional, inappropriate behavior,â€ the defendantâ€™s conduct did not exceed all possible bounds of decency).Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nWhile it is still to be determined whether the School District may have acted negligently in failing to follow certain policies, or by failing to make changes after the two prior incidents, the record fails to reveal any conduct by the School District that was so extreme or outrageous that would enable the Does to survive summary judgment.Â  See Bergstrom v. Palmetto Health Alliance, 358 S.C. 388, 401, 596 S.E.2d 42, 49 (2004) (finding while staff arguably may have acted negligently in failing to follow policies, the staff did not act â€œrecklessly or intentionally in the extreme or outrageous manner described in the complaintâ€).Â  Accordingly, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment as to the Doesâ€™ claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.[4]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the Does have no viable cause of action for intentional infliction of emotion distress because the Does failed to allege any conduct directed towards them that is sufficiently extreme and outrageous on the part of the School District to allow recovery.Â  Therefore, the order of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â It is difficult to discern from the record who the appellants are in this case.Â  After reviewing the order and the record, it appears KK has settled all her individual claims.Â  Therefore, her parents are the only parties appealing.Â \r\n \r\n[2]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3]&nbsp; The complaint is not included in the Record on Appeal.\r\n[4]&nbsp; In light of our disposition of this case, we need not reach the issue of whether the Tort Claims Act is a statutory bar to a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  See Futch v.

Childs, all of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this tort action, John and Jane Doe[1] (the Does) appeal the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to Richland County School District Two (the School District) on their claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  We affirm.[2]\r\nFACTS\r\nDuring the 2001-2002 school year, the School District employed Cassius Rojas as a teacher.Â  Rojas taught math and coached the girlsâ€™ basketball team at Ridge View High School (Ridge View).Â  The Doesâ€™ sixteen-year-old daughter, SD, was a basketball player at Ridge View.Â  \r\n \r\nIn April of 2002, Rojas called SD to the equipment room at Ridge View.Â  He asked her if she could keep a secret and then kissed her.Â  SD, uncertain of what to do, stepped back and then went to class.Â  Rojas also kissed her in the hall on one other occasion, and touched her inappropriately.Â  He continued to make â€œpassesâ€ at SD, and asked her if she was â€œgrownâ€ and â€œwhen [would] she prove it.â€Â  Â \r\nOn August 20, 2002, Principal Sharon Buddin informed the girlsâ€™ basketball team that officers arrested Rojas for having a sexual relationship with another student, KK.Â  After the meeting, SD reported Rojasâ€™ misconduct to school administrators.Â  Before this time, SD did not report Rojas to any school officials.Â  That day, the School District placed Rojas on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation.Â  Soon after, Rojas formally resigned from his teaching and coaching positions at Ridge View.Â \r\n \r\nApproximately one month earlier, on July 29, 2002, while at a coachesâ€™ convention, Rojas confided to Coach Lynch, who was also employed at Ridge View, that he was having sex with KK, a junior at the school.Â  Lynch, believing Rojasâ€™ confession to be â€œthe ramblings of a drunken man,â€ did not inform school officials until August 20, after the School District had discovered Rojasâ€™ misconduct.Â \r\n \r\nIn 2000, prior to the Rojas incident, another coach at Ridge View was accused of having a sexually inappropriate relationship with a female student.Â  During the same year, an administrator at the school was reprimanded for touching studentâ€™s legs when demonstrating proper short lengths and for grabbing student IDs off studentsâ€™ chests instead of asking the students to hand over their IDs.Â Â  \r\n \r\nOn August 5, 2004, the Does and SD filed suit against the School District.[3]Â  On June 20, 2005, the School District moved for summary judgment on the Doesâ€™ claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent supervision.Â  Â \r\nAfter a hearing on January 10, 2006, the trial court found the Does failed to identify any conduct by the School District, so extreme and outrageous, that it exceeded all possible bounds of decency. Â Accordingly, the trial court granted summary judgment to the School District on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.Â  However, the trial court denied the School Districtâ€™s motion with respect to the Doesâ€™ negligent supervision claim.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).Â  Both the trial court and appellate courts apply the same standard when reviewing a summary judgment motion pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP: Â summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  The evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id. at 494, 567 S.E.2d at 860.Â  \r\n \r\nThe party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary support for the opponentâ€™s case, and the non-moving party must show more than the allegations or denials contained in the pleadings.Â  Peterson v. W. Am. Ins. Co., 336 S.C. 89, 94, 518 S.E.2d 608, 610 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The non-moving party must come forward with specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.Â  Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 660, 582 S.E.2d 432, 438 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Does allege the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment on their claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress was an error of law.Â  The Does maintain the trial court erred in finding the School Districtâ€™s behavior was not extreme and outrageous.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina has long recognized â€œthat â€˜oneâ€™s wilful, malicious conduct proximately causing anotherâ€™s emotional distress may be actionableâ€™ as intentional infliction of emotional distress or the tort of outrage.â€Â  Williams v. Lancaster Sch. Dist., 369 S.C. 293, 305, 631 S.E.2d 286, 293 (Ct. App. 2006) (quoting Ford v. Hutson, 276 S.C. 157, 161, 276 S.E.2d 776,Â  778 (1981)).Â  To establish a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress or outrage, a party must show: \r\n \r\n\r\n\t(1) the defendant intentionally or recklessly inflicted severe emotional distress or was certain or substantially certain that such distress would result from his conduct . . . ; (2) the conduct was so â€œextreme and outrageousâ€ as to exceed â€œall possible bounds of decencyâ€ and must be regarded as â€˜atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized communityâ€™ . . . ; (3) the actions of the defendant caused the plaintiffâ€™s emotional distress; and (4) the emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff was â€œsevereâ€ so that â€œno reasonable man could be expected to endure it.â€\r\n\r\nFolkens v. Hunt, 290 S.C. 194, 203, 348 S.E.2d 839, 844 (Ct. App. 1986) (quoting Ford, 276 S.C. at 162, 276 S.E.2d at 778)).Â  \r\n \r\nThe determination of â€œwhether a defendantâ€™s conduct may be reasonably regarded as so extreme and outrageous as to allow recovery is a question for the court to determine in the first instance.â€ Â Butts v. AVX Corp., 292 S.C. 256, 262-63, 355 S.E.2d 876, 880 (Ct. App. 1987); see Andrews v. Piedmont Air Lines, 297 S.C. 367, 371, 377 S.E.2d 127, 129 (Ct. App. 1989) (noting that question of whether a defendantâ€™s conduct may be reasonably regarded as so extreme and outrageous as to permit recovery for intentional infliction of emotional distress is question for the trial court to determine). Â After the initial showing is made that â€œconduct is shown which may be reasonably regarded as extreme and outrageous,â€ the matter should be submitted to the jury to determine â€œwhether the conduct complained of is, in fact, sufficiently extreme and outrageous to result in liability.â€Â  Fleming v. Rose, 338 S.C. 524, 537, 526 S.E.2d 732, 739 (Ct. App. 2000), revâ€™d on other grounds, 350 S.C. 488, 567 S.E.2d 857 (2002).Â  \r\n \r\nWith these considerations in mind, we turn to the case at hand.Â  To support their claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, the Does contend they suffered severe emotion distress due to the School Districtâ€™s failure to (1) provide appropriate sexual harassment training to staff, students, and parents; and (2) follow mandatory federal guidelines.Â  \r\n \r\nOn the outset, we observe the Doesâ€™ arguments are not preserved for review.Â  To preserve an issue for appellate review, the issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.Â  See Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (â€œIt is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.â€).Â  \r\n \r\nAlthough the Does allege in their memorandum in opposition to summary judgment that the School District failed to follow federal guidelines and failed to provide appropriate sexual harassment training to staff, these issues were argued as part of the Does claim for negligence.Â  The Does did not raise these arguments in either their memorandum or at the hearing with respect to their claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  The trial court, in summarily denying the School Districtâ€™s motion for summary judgment as to the Doesâ€™ claim for negligence, presumably found the arguments persuasive on the issue of the School Districtâ€™s negligence.Â  However, it is clear from the trial courtâ€™s order that it did not consider these arguments with respect to the claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  The trial courtâ€™s order only refers to the Doesâ€™ allegations that the School District failed to provide them with written reports and failed to prevent Rojasâ€™ misconduct.Â  Thus, the trial court did not rule on the issues with regard to the claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  Additionally, the Does failed to make any Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion.Â  Therefore, the issues are not preserved for our review on appeal.Â Â  See Washington v. Washington, 308 S.C. 549, 551, 419 S.E.2d 779, 781 (1992) (holding when an appellant neither raises an issue at trial nor through a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to amend, the issue is not properly presented to an appellate court for review).Â  Accordingly, we decline to address the Doesâ€™ points of error on the above mention grounds.\r\nThe Does also contend the School Districtâ€™s failure to act preemptively to prevent the harm which occurred constituted extreme and outrageous behavior.Â  Specifically, the Does point to the School Districtâ€™s failure to follow school policies which they believe, if followed, would have prevented the abuse and the School Districtâ€™s failure to make any changes following the two sexual harassment incidents that preceded the Rojas incident.Â  The Does also argue the School Districtâ€™s actions after the Rojas incident occurred constituted extreme and outrageous behavior.Â  They allege that because the School District failed to act in a timely manner, upon Coach Lynchâ€™s knowledge of Rojasâ€™ sexual harassment of KK, Rojas was able to further victimize SD.Â  They also argue the School District failed to appropriately discipline administrators for failing to prevent the abuse.Â  Additionally, they contend the School Distract failed to provide them with written follow-up reports in accordance with school policy. Â The Does maintain these failures constituted extreme and outrageous behavior on the part of the School District for which they are entitled to recover.\r\nSouth Carolina law limits claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress to egregious conduct toward a plaintiff proximately caused by the defendant.Â  See Upchurch v. N.Y. Times Co., 314 S.C. 531, 536, 431 S.E.2d 558, 561 (1993) (â€œIt is not enough that the conduct is intentional and outrageous.Â  It must be conduct directed at the plaintiff, or occur in the presence of a plaintiff of whom the defendant is aware.â€).Â  We note the record contains no evidence that the School District, in failing to take any preemptive action to prevent the abuse, targeted or directed any of its conduct towards the Does.Â  Further, no evidence suggests the School Districtâ€™s actions after discovering Rojasâ€™ misconduct was directed towards the Does.\r\nMoreover, even if the School Districtâ€™s actions could be construed as being directed toward the Does, we find the Does have not presented any factual allegations of the type of extreme or outrageous conduct committed by the School District that gives rise to a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  Viewed in a light most favorable to the Does, the School Districtâ€™s behavior in this instance is not sufficiently severe to rise to the level of conduct considered â€œso extreme and outrageous as to exceed all possible bounds of decency [that] must be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.â€Â  Upchurch, 314 S.C. at 536, 431 S.E.2d at 561.Â  The Does have shown â€œno hostile or abusive encounters, or coercive or oppressive conduct.â€Â  Gattison v. S.C. State College, 318 S.C. 148, 157, 456 S.E.2d 414, 419 (Ct. App. 1995) (finding although plaintiff alleged â€œunprofessional, inappropriate behavior,â€ the defendantâ€™s conduct did not exceed all possible bounds of decency).Â  Â Â \r\nWhile it is still to be determined whether the School District may have acted negligently in failing to follow certain policies, or by failing to make changes after the two prior incidents, the record fails to reveal any conduct by the School District that was so extreme or outrageous that would enable the Does to survive summary judgment.Â  See Bergstrom v.

Â Therefore, the order of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â It is difficult from the record to discern who the appellants are in this case.Â  The record does not indicate that SD settled her claims.Â  However, after reviewing the order on appeal, it appears SDâ€™s parents are the only parties appealing.Â Â  \r\n \r\n[2]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3] The complaint is not included in the Record on Appeal.\r\n[4] In light of our disposition of this case, we need not reach the issue of whether the Tort Claims Act is a statutory bar to a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  See Futch v.
