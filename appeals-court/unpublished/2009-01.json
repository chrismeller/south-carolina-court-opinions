Dunaway, III, of Anderson, for Â Appellant.\r\n        Nancy Jo Thomason, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n        Amy C. Sutherland, of Greenville, for Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â This\r\n  is a custody dispute.Â  The family court awarded care, custody, and control of\r\n  the partiesâ€™ son (Child) to Joey Dwayne Camper.Â  Tuesday Elaine Santiago, Childâ€™s\r\n  mother, appeals.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS AND\r\n  PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nChild was born to Santiago and Camper on September 29,\r\n  2001.Â  Santiago and Camper met when Santiago was fourteen and Camper was twenty-one.Â \r\n  They lived together several years, never married, and separated when Child was twenty\r\n  months old.\r\nIn 2004, the parties reached a full and final\r\n  agreement concerning Childâ€™s placement.Â  Under the agreement, Santiago would\r\n  have sole legal custody and primary placement of Child, and Camper was to pay\r\n  child support and have reasonable visitation.Â  On May 24, 2004, the family\r\n  court filed an order incorporating the agreement.\r\nIn July 2004, Santiago relocated with Child to Houston, Texas.Â  Camper, however, did not become aware of\r\n  the move until July 20, 2004, when he arrived at Childâ€™s daycare facility to\r\n  pick Child up for a visit and was told by the daycare owner that Santiagoâ€™s mother had called and advised that Child would not be coming back.Â  After\r\n  unsuccessfully attempting to reach Santiago by telephone and in person, Camper\r\n  went to the office of the attorney who had represented him at the custody\r\n  hearing and learned that the attorney had received an e-mail advising her that Santiago was moving to Texas.\r\nLater that month,\r\n  Camper filed the present action, requesting temporary and permanent custody of Child,\r\n  child support from Santiago, and attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  Pursuant to\r\n  Camperâ€™s motion, the family court set an emergency temporary hearing on July\r\n  30, 2004, to determine the issues of temporary custody, child support, and\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nBy order dated\r\n  August 11, 2004, and filed August 23, 2004, the family court found, among other\r\n  things: Â (1) Santiagoâ€™s move to Texas prevented Camper from exercising his\r\n  court-ordered visitation rights with Child; (2) there was no showing that\r\n  Santiagoâ€™s move would substantially benefit Child and, if Child were to\r\n  continue to live with Santiago in Texas, this would greatly diminish Camperâ€™s right\r\n  to participate in Childâ€™s upbringing; and (3) Santiagoâ€™s move constituted a\r\n  substantial change in conditions enabling the family court to alter or amend\r\n  the prior custody order.Â  Based on these findings, the family court granted the\r\n  parties temporary joint custody if Santiago returned to South Carolina.Â  In the\r\n  alternative, if Santiago chose to remain in Texas, Camper would have temporary\r\n  custody of Child and Santiago would have visitation every other weekend.Â  Santiago chose to remain in Texas, and as a result the family court issued another order\r\n  on September 20, 2004, granting Camper temporary custody of Child, awarding\r\n  visitation to Santiago, and ordering Santiago to pay child support.Â  \r\nWhile the case was\r\n  pending, Santiago married and unsuccessfully sought to change the custody\r\n  arrangement to a shared placement plan.Â  By consent of the parties and with the\r\n  approval of the family court, however, Santiago received more time with Child\r\n  during her weekend visits and extended visitation during the holiday season.\r\nThe family court\r\n  held a final hearing in the matter in 2006.[1]Â \r\n  On October 31, 2006, the family court issued and filed an order granting Camper\r\n  care, custody, and control of Child and awarding liberal visitation to Santiago.Â  In reaching this decision, the court found that, despite Santiagoâ€™s explanation\r\n  that she had moved to Texas for better job opportunities, the primary reason\r\n  for her move was to be with her boyfriend. Â In addition, the court questioned\r\n  her honesty and forthrightness in her actions after she received legal custody\r\n  of Child in 2004.Â  After an unsuccessful motion for reconsideration,\r\n  alteration, or amendment of the order, Santiago filed this appeal.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nSantiago contends the family court erred in awarding custody\r\n  of Child to Camper based on her relocation to Texas.Â  We agree.\r\nOn August 16, 2004,\r\n  after the emergency temporary order was signed but before it was filed, the\r\n  supreme court issued Latimer v. Farmer, 360 S.C. 375, 602 S.E.2d 32\r\n  (2004).Â  In Latimer, the court held that relocation by a custodial\r\n  parent was, without more, not necessarily a change of circumstances warranting\r\n  modification of a childâ€™s placement.Â  Id. at 382, 602 S.E.2d at 35.Â \r\n  Reiterating the longstanding emphasis on serving the childâ€™s best interest in\r\n  making a custody determination, the court stated as follows:\r\n\r\n  First,\r\n    we recognize that standards imposing restrictions on relocation have become\r\n    antiquated in our increasingly transient society.Â  Second, confusion abounds\r\n    surrounding the status of our relocation law, in part, because of the often\r\n    stated, but infrequently applied, presumption against relocation.Â  In all child\r\n    custody cases, including relocation cases, the controlling considerations are\r\n    the childâ€™s welfare and best interests.Â  The presumption against relocation\r\n      is a meaningless supposition to the extent a custodial parentâ€™s relocation\r\n      would, in fact, be in the childâ€™s best interest.\r\n\r\nId. at 381, 602 S.E.2d at 34-35 (emphasis added).Â  The\r\n  court went on to hold that the noncustodial parent, who had opposed the\r\n  relocation of the child with the custodial parent and sought a change of custody\r\n  based on this factor, bore the burden of establishing that (1) a substantial\r\n  change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child had occurred as a\r\n  result of the relocation; and (2) a change in custody would be in the childâ€™s\r\n  best interest.Â  Id. at 382, 602 S.E.2d at 35. Â Moreover, despite the\r\n  acknowledgement that relocation of a child with his or her custodial parent\r\n  would almost always compromise the noncustodial parentâ€™s visitation rights, the\r\n  court unequivocally held that â€œ[i]t should not be assumed that merely\r\n  relocating and potentially burdening the non-custodial parentâ€™s visitation\r\n  rights always negatively affects the childâ€™s best interests.â€ Â Id. at 382, 602 S.E.2d at 35.Â  The court then proceeded to consider several factors\r\n  in determining whether the relocation warranted a change of custody, among them\r\n  â€œthe availability of a realistic substitute visitation arrangement that will adequately\r\n  foster an ongoing relationship between [the noncustodial parent] and Child.â€Â  Id. at 385, 602 S.E.2d at 37.\r\nIn support of its\r\n  decision to award custody to Camper, the family court expressed â€œgreat concernâ€\r\n  about Santiagoâ€™s â€œlack of honesty and forthrightness in her actions since she\r\n  was granted custody in May, 2004.â€Â  Although Santiagoâ€™s abrupt move to Texas without advance notice to Camper may have warranted this concern, this fact, without\r\n  more, does not necessarily constitute a substantial change in circumstances\r\n  affecting Childâ€™s welfare and warranting a change in custody.Â  Also troubling is\r\n  the family courtâ€™s apparent decision to approach the custody dispute as one in\r\n  which Santiago, as the relocating party, had the burden to show that her decision\r\n  to leave South Carolina was in Childâ€™s best interest.Â  As to Childâ€™s best\r\n  interest, the only factor cited in the family court order as one that was\r\n  affected by Santiagoâ€™s move to Texas was Childâ€™s contact with Camper and both\r\n  sides of Childâ€™s extended family.Â  As to that factor, the family court, without\r\n  explanation, found there existed no â€œrealistic substitute visitation\r\n  arrangement that would have adequately fostered an ongoing relationship between\r\n  non-custodial parent and child after Defendant/Mother relocated to Texas,â€ but\r\n  apparently never considered the possibility of providing visitation through telephone\r\n  contact or other means of communication.Â  See id. at 379, 602\r\n  S.E.2d at 34 (noting the noncustodial parent who was opposing the childâ€™s relocation\r\n  with the custodial parent was awarded extensive visitation â€œincluding computer\r\n  teleconferencing, e-mail, and telephone contactâ€).\r\nWe therefore hold the family court, in changing\r\n  custody of Child from Santiago to Camper, did not make a proper determination\r\n  as to whether Santiagoâ€™s relocation to Texas adversely affected Childâ€™s best\r\n  interest. Â For this reason, we reverse the decision to grant custody of Child\r\n  to Camper and remand the matter to the family court for further proceedings\r\n  consistent with this opinion.Â  On remand, the family court may consider any new\r\n  evidence properly before it, including evidence concerning developments since\r\n  the final merits hearing.Â  Custody of Child shall remain with Camper pending\r\n  further order of the family court.\r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nSHORT, THOMAS,\r\nand PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The trial required three hearing dates:Â  March 29,\r\nMay 5, and September 7, 2006.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-002","title":"Morlan v.

Ernest\r\nKinard, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion\r\nNo. 2009-UP-002\r\nHeard November\r\n6, 2008 â€“ Filed January 5, 2009\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND\r\nREMANDED \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        William W. Watkins, Sr., and W.D. Morris, of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\n        Tobias G. Ward, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this action to quiet title,\r\n  James A. Kelly (James) and Tamika Kelly (Tamika) appeal the dismissal of their counterclaims\r\n  for civil conspiracy, negligent misrepresentation, and fraud. Â James and Tamika\r\n  assert the trial court erred in dismissing their tort counterclaims on the\r\n  ground the allegations, based on a purported installment sales contract, failed\r\n  to prove the existence of some other relationship, irrespective of the\r\n  contract, that would give rise to a duty in tort.[1] Â James and\r\n  Tamika further assert the trial court erred in ordering payment of fire\r\n  insurance and property taxes pending a trial on the merits.Â  Â We reverse and\r\nremand.\r\n1. Â As to the dismissal of the tort counterclaims, we\r\n  find the trial court erred in dismissing the counterclaims on the basis of the\r\n  partiesâ€™ contractual relationship as opposed to some other relationship giving\r\n  rise to a duty outside of the contract.Â  We note the trial court denied summary\r\n  judgment acknowledging a dispute as to the existence of the contract. Â Until\r\n  the factual conflict as to the existence of the contract is resolved, the\r\n  dismissal of the counterclaims on the basis of any alleged contract where the\r\n  existence of that contract is disputed was error.Â  Moreover, the counterclaimant\r\n  sufficiently alleged a civil conspiracy cause of action. Â See Pye v.\r\n    Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 567, 633 S.E.2d 505, 511 (2006) (stating the\r\n  elements of conspiracy). Â Additionally, as to negligent misrepresentation and\r\n  fraud, review of the allegations reveals a duty in tort was sufficiently\r\n  alleged by way of agency, especially noting paragraphs fifteen and twenty-one\r\n  in the pleadings. Â Accordingly, we find the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of the\r\ncounterclaims was erroneous. Â \r\n2.Â  As to special damages for civil conspiracy, we\r\n  find the pleadings sufficiently alleged special damages.Â  The statement in\r\n  paragraph fourteen asserting damage from the eviction actions in magistrate\r\n  court constitutes a sufficient allegation of special damages as the damages\r\n  from defending the eviction actions stem from the overt act and are not\r\n  included in the other two counterclaims.Â  See Rule 9(g), SCRCP (â€œWhen\r\n  items of special damage are claimed, they shall be specifically stated.â€); Pye,\r\n  369 S.C. at 567-68, 633 S.E.2d at 511 (stating the gravamen of the tort of\r\n  civil conspiracy is the damage resulting to the plaintiff from an overt act\r\n  done pursuant to the combination and noting the damages alleged must go beyond\r\n  the damages alleged in other causes of action).Â  Accordingly, the trial court\r\nerred in dismissing the civil conspiracy claim on this alternative basis.Â  \r\n3.Â  As to whether the pleadings failed to allege\r\n  circumstances of fraud pursuant to Rule 9(b), SCRCP, we find the pleadings\r\n  sufficiently allege all nine elements of fraud with particularity; therefore, the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s dismissal of the fraud counterclaim on this basis was error. Â See Rule 9(b), SCRCP (the circumstances constituting fraud shall be stated with\r\n  particularity); Schnellmann v. Roettger, 373 S.C. 379, 382, 645 S.E.2d\r\n  239, 241 (2007) (stating a cause of action for fraud requires the following\r\n  elements: (1) a representation; (2) its falsity; (3) its materiality; (4)\r\n  knowledge of its falsity or a reckless disregard for its truth or falsity; (5)\r\n  intent that the representation be acted upon; (6) the hearerâ€™s ignorance of its\r\n  falsity; (7) the hearerâ€™s reliance on its truth; (8) the hearerâ€™s right to rely\r\nthereon; and (9) the hearerâ€™s consequent and proximate injury).Â  \r\n4.Â  Finally, with regard to whether the trial court\r\n  erred in ordering payment of fire insurance and property taxes pending trial,\r\n  the court need not address this issue as it is interlocutory and, therefore,\r\n  not directly appealable. See Temples v. Ramsey, 285 S.C. 600,\r\n  602, 330 S.E.2d 558, 559 (Ct. App. 1985) (dismissing appeal where the trial\r\n  court order denying mistrial and granting continuance conditioned on payment of\r\n  certain costs was interlocutory and therefore not directly appealable).Â  Even\r\n  if we were to consider this issue along with the other appealable issues, we\r\n  find no abuse of discretion.Â  The trial court, sitting in equity, has the\r\n  inherent power to preserve property during the pendency of litigation.Â  Cf. County Council of Charleston v. Felkel, 244 S.C. 480, 480, 137 S.E.2d\r\n  577, 577 (1964) (â€œIn [the] case of property rights the purpose [of a temporary\r\n  injunction] is to preserve the status quo pending litigation.â€). Â Here, the\r\n  trial court ordered appellants to pay property taxes and insurance on the property\r\n  pending litigation of the matter in order to preserve the status quo.Â Â  The\r\n  trial court based this finding on the ground that appellants are in exclusive\r\n  possession of the property.Â  Additionally, the trial court provided for\r\n  proration of taxes and insurance paid in the final order, if necessary.Â \r\n  Accordingly, it was not an abuse of discretion for the court to order payment\r\nof taxes and insurance pending trial.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nWILLIAMS, PIEPER, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] James and Tamika did not raise the argument that an\r\n  equitable interest in an installment contract must be foreclosed; therefore,\r\nthat issue is not before us for review.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-003","title":"Perry v.

Spradley, of Saluda, and Katherine Carruth\r\n          Link, of West Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Robert L. Widener, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n        Melissa L. Franklin, of Aiken, for Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this appeal from the denial of\r\n  a request to transfer child custody, appellant, Laura C. Perry (Mother),\r\n  asserts the family court erred in: (1) denying her request for sole custody of\r\n  the children; (2) denying her request to designate her as the primary custodial\r\n  parent; (3) denying her request to lift the residency restriction; (4) failing\r\n  to address the issue of child support and failing to award child support; and\r\n(5) making factual findings contrary to the weight of the evidence.Â Â  We affirm.\r\n1.Â  As to Mother's request to transfer custody, the\r\n  evidence reveals the children are doing well academically and otherwise despite\r\n  the parties' alleged inability to communicate and cooperate under the current\r\n  joint custody arrangement.Â  Accordingly, we find Mother has failed to meet her\r\n  burden of establishing a change in circumstances sufficient to warrant a transfer\r\n  of custody. Â See Pinckney v. Hudson, 294 S.C. 332, 333, 364\r\n  S.E.2d 462, 462 (1988) (&quot;The standard for determining whether custody\r\n  should be changed is whether there is a substantial change in circumstances\r\n  affecting the welfare of the child.&quot;); Pitt v. Olds, 333 S.C. 478,\r\n  481, 511 S.E.2d 60, 61 (1999) (&quot;A change in circumstances justifying a\r\n  change in the custody of a child simply means that sufficient facts have been\r\n  shown to warrant the conclusion that the best interests of the child will be\r\n  served by the change.&quot;); Sharpe v. Sharpe, 256 S.C. 517, 183 S.E.2d\r\n  325 (1971) (&quot;[T]he change of circumstance relied on for a change of\r\n  custody must be such as would substantially affect the interest and the welfare\r\n  of the child, not merely the parties, their wishes or convenience.&quot;); Woodall\r\n    v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996) (&quot;[T]he\r\n  appellate court should be reluctant to substitute its own evaluation of the\r\nevidence on child custody for that of the trial court.&quot;).\r\n2.Â  As to whether the family court erred in denying\r\n  Mother's request for primary placement of the children, we find no error. Â Although\r\n  the issue of primary placement was reserved in the divorce decree, the issue\r\n  was only raised to the court in Mother's counterclaim and was not otherwise originally\r\n  reserved in the joint custody agreement or its addendum.Â  Thus, a showing of a sufficient\r\n  change in circumstances is warranted for a determination on this issue.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  as we find Mother failed to meet her burden of establishing a change in\r\n  circumstances affecting the welfare and best interests of the children, we find\r\n  no error in the trial court's denial of primary placement at this time.Â  See Glanton v. Glanton, 314 S.C. 58, 60-63, 443 S.E.2d 810, 811-13 (Ct. App.\r\n  1994) (finding mother's outlook and approach to child's education since the\r\n  last court order have adversely affected the child so as to warrant a change in\r\nprimary placement).\r\n3.Â  As to the residency restriction, the family court\r\n  applied the correct best interest analysis in determining that relocation was\r\n  not in the best interests of the children.Â  While we note that lifting the\r\n  residency restriction may enhance Mother's life, we further find support for\r\n  the family court's determination that lifting the residency restriction would\r\n  not otherwise enhance the children's lives so as to be in their best interests.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find Mother failed to meet her burden of establishing that relocation\r\n  is in the best interests of the children.Â  See Latimer v. Farmer,\r\n  360 S.C. 375, 380, 602 S.E.2d 32, 34 (2004) (&quot;In all custody cases,\r\n  including relocation cases, the controlling considerations are the child's\r\nwelfare and best interests.&quot;).\r\n4.Â  With regard to child support, the family court, in\r\n  reaffirming the joint custody agreement, denied Mother's request for support. Â While\r\n  an award of child support is subject to modification upon a showing of changed\r\n  circumstances and is not determinative upon a change of custody, Mother failed\r\n  to establish a sufficient change in circumstances to warrant a modification of\r\n  the existing agreement.Â  See Upchurch v. Upchurch, 367 S.C. 16,\r\n  624 S.E.2d 643 (2006) (finding husband's lack of concrete figures constitutes\r\n  insufficient proof of a change in the children's needs or circumstances to\r\n  modify the existing child support order).Â  Furthermore, we note the settlement\r\n  agreement provides that Father alone bears the additional costs of various\r\n  medical and educational expenses associated with the children.Â  Thus, based\r\n  upon the absence of evidence of a sufficient change of circumstances, the\r\nfamily court's denial of child support was not in error.\r\n5.Â  As to Mother's assertion that the family court's\r\n  findings of fact were contrary to the weight of the evidence, this issue is\r\n  without merit as the family court's findings are amply supported by the\r\n  evidence in the record.Â  Although Mother and Father presented different\r\n  accounts of various occurrences, we are mindful of the deference given to the\r\n  family court regarding witness testimony and credibility.

Nettles, Circuit\r\n  Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2009-UP-004\r\nHeard November 6, 2008 â€“ Filed January 7,\r\n  2009\r\nREVERSED \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tMark Weston Hardee, Esquire, and William\r\n  Norman Nettles, Esquire, both of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tSamuel W. Outen, Esquire, and William J.\r\n  Watkins, Jr., Esquire, both of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nGEATHERS, J.: This appeal arises from the\r\n  grant of a motion to dismiss.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s order of dismissal was\r\n  precipitated by the Respondentâ€™s motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1),\r\n  SCRCP, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  \r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAppellant TCI Media, Inc. (TCI) contracted with\r\n  Respondent NuVox Communications, Inc. (NuVox) to provide certain services to\r\n  TCI, including the electronic storage of specific information.Â  Pursuant to its\r\n  contractual rights, TCI requested customer information from NuVox, and NuVox denied\r\n  TCIâ€™s request.Â  \r\nSimultaneously, TCI was involved in criminal\r\n  litigation in the United States District Court of the Southern District of Ohio\r\n  (District Court) regarding its business transactions.Â  During the federal\r\n  investigation, the Department of Justice served subpoenas on NuVox, seeking\r\n  disclosure of certain stored e-mail accounts registered to one of TCIâ€™s\r\n  co-defendants.Â  In response, TCI and its co-defendants instituted\r\n  civil litigation seeking discovery, a return of assets seized by the federal government,\r\n  and injunctive relief, among other claims.Â  The District Court stayed the civil\r\n  litigation pending resolution of the criminal case.Â  \r\nSubsequently, TCI filed the instant action to obtain\r\n  the previously requested information.Â  The complaint alleged that NuVox\r\n  breached the contract and its fiduciary duty by declining to provide the information\r\n  to TCI.Â  TCI admitted at the hearing on the motion to dismiss, and on appeal,\r\n  that it sought this information to assist it in the federal criminal litigation.Â \r\n  In response, NuVox filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, to stay\r\n  litigation, on two grounds.Â  NuVox asserted that (1) the District Court issued\r\n  two orders prohibiting further discovery in civil litigation, such as that\r\n  sought by TCI, and (2) 18 U.S.C.A. Â§ 2703(e) prohibited the very litigation\r\n  commenced by TCI.[1]Â  The circuit court found that the District Courtâ€™s orders were not binding\r\n  in the state court proceeding and that the federal statute was inapplicable in\r\n  the instant case.Â  Nonetheless, the circuit court dismissed the matter, finding\r\n  that TCI brought the lawsuit solely to circumvent the discovery provisions of\r\n  the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and that such action constituted an\r\n  abuse of process.Â  \r\nISSUE ON APPEAL\r\nTCI only discusses and provides authority for one of\r\n  its issues on appeal, and therefore, the other issue is deemed abandoned.[2]Â  See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314\r\n  S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (issues not argued in the brief are\r\n  deemed abandoned and will not be considered on appeal); Ellie, Inc. v.\r\n    Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 99, 594 S.E.2d 485, 496 (Ct. App. 2004) (where an\r\n  issue is not argued within the body of the brief but is only a short conclusory\r\n  statement, it is abandoned on appeal). Hence, the only issue on appeal is\r\n  whether the circuit court erred in granting NuVoxâ€™s motion to dismiss by\r\n  considering TCIâ€™s purpose for requesting its records.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn this case, Respondent filed a 12(b)(1) motion to\r\n  dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  A question of subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction is a question of law for the court.Â  Lake v. Reeder\r\n    Constr. Co., 330 S.C. 242, 247, 498 S.E.2d 650, 653 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp; Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\nA challenge to subject matter jurisdiction can be\r\n  raised by a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), SCRCP.Â  Ballenger v.\r\n    Bowen, 313 S.C. 476, 478, 443 S.E.2d 379, 380, n.2 (1994); Wheeler v.\r\n      Morrison, 313 S.C. 440, 442, 438 S.E.2d 264, 265 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\nSubject matter jurisdiction is the â€œpower to hear and\r\n  determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question\r\n  belong.â€Â  Coon v. Coon, 364 S.C. 563, 566, 614 S.E.2d 616, 617 (2005); Mr.\r\n    T v. Ms. T, 378 S.C. 127, 133, 662 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  â€œSubject\r\n  matter jurisdiction is met if the case is brought in the court which has the\r\n  authority and power to determine the type of action at issue.â€Â  Washington v. Whitaker, 317 S.C. 108, 115, 451 S.E.2d 894, 898 (1994).Â  \r\nThere is only one circuit court in South Carolina and it has\r\n  uniform subject matter jurisdiction throughout the State.Â  Dove v. Gold Kist,\r\n  314 S.C. 235, 238, 442 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1994); see also S.C. Const. art.\r\n  V, Â§ 1.Â  The circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction over civil and\r\n  criminal actions.Â  Id.Â  Therefore, the circuit court had subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction to adjudicate the contract dispute between TCI and NuVox.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp; Circuit Courtâ€™s Basis for Dismissing the ActionÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe circuit courtâ€™s basis for dismissing the instant action\r\n  was erroneous.Â  The circuit court did not specifically grant the motion to\r\n  dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), SCRCP.Â  Rather, the court granted the motion\r\n  because it found that the â€œlawsuit was brought solely to circumvent the\r\n  discovery provisions of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.â€Â  The court\r\n  stated: \r\n\r\n\tThis court recognizes that if the primary purpose of\r\n  [the instant case] was something other than conducting discovery for a federal\r\n  criminal case pending in Ohio, it would not be objectionable that discovery in\r\n  South Carolina might have the ancillary benefit of assisting TCI and the\r\n  criminal defendants in the federal case.Â  However, this court cannot permit an\r\n  action to be instituted solely to gain information, when that information\r\n  should be obtained through the use of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nIn other words, the circuit court conceded that it did have\r\n  jurisdiction of the matter, but it simply did not sanction TCIâ€™s motive for\r\n  bringing the suit.Â  However, the purpose for which a lawsuit is commenced is\r\n  not a relevant inquiry for determining whether a court has subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  \r\nFurther, the circuit courtâ€™s reliance on Food Lion,\r\n  Inc. v. United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Intâ€™l Union, 351 S.C. 65, 567\r\n  S.E.2d 251 (Ct. App. 2002) and Huggins v. Winn-Dixie Greenville, Inc.,\r\n  249 S.C. 206, 153 S.E.2d 693 (1967) as authority for dismissal is misplaced.Â  These\r\n  cases involve the common-law tort of abuse of process, which provides a remedy\r\n  for one harmed by anotherâ€™s perversion of a legal procedure for a purpose not\r\n  intended by the procedure.Â  See Food Lion, Inc. at 69-70, 567\r\n  S.E.2d at 253 (citing Huggins at 210, 153 S.E.2d at 695 and W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of\r\n    Torts Â§ 121 at 897 (5th ed. 1984)).Â  \r\nâ€œAn abuse of process action is not designed to compel\r\n  compliance with court procedure or to deter future misconduct.Â  Rather, the\r\n  tort is intended to compensate a party for harm resulting from anotherâ€™s misuse\r\n  of the legal system.â€ Â Food Lion, Inc. at 74 n.5, 567 S.E.2d at 255 n.\r\n  5.Â  The misuse usually takes the form of coercion to obtain a collateral\r\n  advantage, and there is no liability where the defendant has done nothing more\r\n  than carry out the process to its authorized conclusion, even though with bad\r\n  intentions.Â  Hainer v. Am. Med. Intâ€™l, Inc., 328 S.C. 128, 136, 492\r\n  S.E.2d 103, 107 (1997). \r\nIn the instant case, it is not evident\r\n  that TCI, by its initiation of the lawsuit, misused the legal system through\r\n  coercive acts that were intended to harm NuVox.Â  In fact, the circuit court\r\n  found that TCIâ€™s purpose for bringing the lawsuit was to obtain information.Â  While there may be other avenues for addressing TCIâ€™s\r\n  underlying motives, the procedural mechanism utilized by the circuit court is\r\n  not the proper one; and, the authority underlying the abuse of process tort is\r\n  not a proper basis for dismissing TCIâ€™s suit.Â  Hence, the circuit court erred when it used the legal basis of abuse\r\n    of process as authority for granting the dismissal. \r\nC.&nbsp; Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP\r\nWhile\r\n  the Record on Appeal does not so indicate, TCI asserts, and the parties\r\n  conceded at oral argument before this Court, that the trial courtâ€™s order of\r\n  dismissal was more likely based on a 12(b)(6), rather than\r\n  on a 12(b)(1), rationale.Â  However, even if the motion to dismiss was granted\r\n  pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, the result in the instant matter would be the\r\n  same.Â  \r\nThe ruling on a 12(b)(6), SCRCP, motion to dismiss\r\n  must be based solely on the allegations set forth in the complaint.Â  Plyler\r\n    v. Burns, 373 S.C. 637, 645, 647 S.E.2d 188, 192 (2007).Â  The complaint\r\n  should not be dismissed merely because the court doubts that the plaintiff will\r\n  prevail in the action.Â  Doe v. Marion, 361 S.C. 463, 469, 605 S.E.2d 556,\r\n  559 (Ct. App. 2004). The motion cannot be\r\n  granted if the facts set forth in the complaint and the inferences reasonably\r\n  drawn therefrom would entitle the Plaintiff to relief on any theory of the\r\n  case.Â  Ashley River Prop. I, L.L.C. v. Ashley River Prop. II, L.L.C., 374 S.C. 271, 278, 648 S.E.2d 295, 298 (Ct. App. 2007). Because TCI\r\n  pleaded facts sufficient to state a cause of action for breach of contract, the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s grant of dismissal pursuant to 12(b)(6) would also constitute\r\n  reversible error.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s order is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nWILLIAMS, J., and PIEPER, J., concur. Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â 18 U.S.C.A. Â§ 2703(e) provides: No cause of\r\n  action shall lie in any court against any provider of wire or electronic\r\n  communication services, its officers, employees, agents, or other specified\r\n  persons for providing information, facilities, or assistance in accordance with\r\n  the terms of a court order, warrant, subpoena, statutory authorization, or\r\n  certification under this chapter. \r\n[2] Thus, we will not address the issue of whether a\r\n  customer has the right to use the South Carolina judicial process to enforce\r\n  contractual rights against a South Carolina business. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-005","title":"State v.

Falkner Wilkes, of Greenville, for Appellant-Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\tBruce Wyche Bannister, of Greenville, for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â This is a cross-appeal in a divorce action.Â  June T.\r\n  Fuller (Wife) alleges error in the inclusion of her premarital home in the\r\n  marital estate and the decision of the family court to accept the valuation and\r\n  distribution of the marital assets proposed by James T. Fuller (Husband). Â Husband\r\n  alleges error in the family courtâ€™s assignment of one hundred percent of the\r\n  marital debt to him.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThe parties married\r\n  in 1979 and separated in 2003.Â  No children were born of the marriage.Â  When\r\n  they married, Wife had been employed with Hoechst Celanese for twelve years.Â \r\n  Husband at the time was unemployed, having been fired from his most recent\r\n  job.Â  Shortly after the marriage, Wife quit her job and bought a trucking\r\n  business, and Husband worked for her as a truck driver.\r\nThe\r\n  marital residence was a house on Heathwood Drive, in Taylors, South Carolina. Â Wife\r\n  purchased the house in 1969 with her former husband.Â  Wife paid her former\r\n  husband $22,500 for his half-interest in the home before she married Husband.\r\nWhen Husband and\r\n  Wife married, Wife had a mortgage of $22,000 on the home.Â  The mortgage was\r\n  paid off by 1982 with funds Wife earned both before and during her marriage to\r\n  Husband.Â  According to Wife, although Husband was working for her in her\r\n  trucking business, he did not contribute any funds toward payment of the\r\n  mortgage.Â  During their marriage, the parties added a screened-in porch to the\r\n  house and made it into a Florida room.Â  Although Wife maintained she paid for\r\n  the improvement from her earnings, she acknowledged Husband performed the\r\n  physical labor.Â  Husband also maintained he contributed toward other\r\n  improvements, including glass in the side of the carport, an additional\r\n  building behind the house, and porch cement.\r\nThe parties\r\n  separated on February 14, 2003.Â  According to Wife, the separation occurred\r\n  following an altercation between the parties over a tax refund.Â  Wife filed a\r\n  complaint in the family court on February 21, 2003, and amended it in May\r\n  2003.Â  Husband answered and counterclaimed, and Wife filed a reply.Â  \r\nThe matter came\r\n  before the family court on June 23, 2004, and January 20, 2005, for a final\r\n  hearing.Â  At the end of the first full day of the hearing, the family court\r\n  granted Husbandâ€™s motion to bifurcate the proceedings.Â  By order issued at the\r\n  conclusion of the first hearing on June 23, 2004, the parties were divorced.\r\nOn\r\n  March 15, 2005, the family court issued an order addressing the remaining\r\n  issues.Â  Of relevance to this appeal, the family court (1) found Wife had shown\r\n  sufficient evidence of physical abuse by Husband constituting marital\r\n  misconduct; (2) ordered that â€œ[a]ll of the marital debts listed on the\r\n  Financial Declarations and in existence at the time of the filing of the\r\n  original Complaint in February 2003 shall be the sole responsibility of\r\n  [Husband]â€; and (3) identified and valued the marital assets using a list\r\n  provided by Husband and found that a 50-50 division of the marital assets was\r\n  proper.Â  The family court also found Husband in contempt for certain\r\n  misrepresentations concerning a workersâ€™ compensation settlement, his social\r\n  security income, and his ownership of a motorcycle.Â  As a result, Husband was\r\n  ordered to pay $12,875 toward Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Nevertheless, the court\r\n  based its equitable division award primarily on a statement Husband provided\r\n  that listed, valued, and divided the marital assets, instead of a similar\r\n  statement provided by Wife. Â Husbandâ€™s statement included as a marital asset the\r\n  Heathwood Drive home that Wife had purchased with her former husband and had\r\n  served as the partiesâ€™ residence before their separation.\r\nWife\r\n  moved to alter or amend the order, and the motions were heard December 13,\r\n  2005.Â  Following an order issued later that month, both parties appealed.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Wife alleges error in the\r\n  family courtâ€™s inclusion of the Heathwood Drive residence in the marital estate,\r\n  arguing (1) there were no specific findings of fact in the family courtâ€™s order\r\n  that would support a finding of transmutation; and (2) Husband failed to prove she\r\n  had intended that the home would be transmuted into marital property.Â  We find\r\n  no reversible error.[2]\r\nWife is correct\r\n  that the appealed order is devoid of any pertinent findings of fact regarding\r\n  transmutation of the home; however, â€œif this Court can make its own findings\r\n  from its review of the evidence, remand is not necessary.â€Â  Sutton v. Sutton,\r\n  291 S.C. 401, 411, 353 S.E.2d 884, 889 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Based on our review of\r\n  the record on appeal in this case, we find there is ample evidence of more than\r\n  â€œmere useâ€ of the home that would support a finding that, regardless of indications\r\n  that Wife always intended to retain sole title to the property, it was used in\r\n  support of the marriage so as to demonstrate the partiesâ€™ intent to make it a\r\n  marital asset.Â  See Pool v. Pool, 321 S.C. 84, 88, 467 S.E.2d\r\n  753, 756 (Ct. App. 1996) (stating transmutation of nonmarital property may\r\n  occur if the property (1) becomes so commingled with marital property as to be\r\n  untraceable; (2) becomes jointly titled; or (3) is utilized by the parties in\r\n  support of the marriage or in some other manner so as to evidence an intent by\r\n  the parties to make it marital property).Â  Although Wife maintains Husband did\r\n  not contribute directly to the mortgage payment, she acknowledges he was\r\n  working while the mortgage was being paid off and his earnings assisted the\r\n  parties in meeting their other expenses during this time.Â  In addition, the\r\n  parties lived in the home almost twenty-four years, during which Husband\r\n  contributed his physical labor to various improvements.[3]\r\n2.Â  Wife further argues the\r\n  family court erred in adopting Husbandâ€™s proposal for division of the marital\r\n  property, apparently rejecting the proposal she submitted.Â  We find no error.\r\nIn the appealed\r\n  order, the family court gave no reason for why it elected to use Husbandâ€™s\r\n  marital assets sheet instead of Wifeâ€™s.Â  In addition, Wife emphasizes Husbandâ€™s\r\n  misconduct both before and during the proceedings, including his physical abuse\r\n  of her and his misrepresentation to the family court about his assets and\r\n  income.Â  Wife, however, did not give any specific reasons as to why the family\r\n  courtâ€™s valuation and division of the marital assets were incorrect, nor did\r\n  she provide appraisals or other independent evidence to support her valuations.Â \r\n  Moreover, although the family court elected to use Husbandâ€™s marital assets\r\n  sheet, it also made adjustments for Husbandâ€™s misrepresentations and imposed\r\n  sanctions on him by ordering him to pay Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees. Â Under these\r\n  circumstances, we hold Wife has not presented a basis on which to find the\r\n  family court abused its discretion in dividing the marital assets and therefore\r\n  decline to disturb the provisions of the appealed order addressing this issue.Â  See Craig v. Craig, 365 S.C. 285, 290, 617 S.E.2d 359, 361 (2005)\r\n  (â€œThe division of marital property is within the discretion of the family court\r\n  judge and the judgeâ€™s decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse\r\n  of discretion.â€).\r\n3.Â  Husband also appeals the\r\n  decision of the family court.Â  He argues that the family court abused its\r\n  discretion in assigning all of the marital debt to him.Â  Husband avers such an\r\n  assignment of debt (1) is a violation of the statutory requirement that marital\r\n  debt be equitably divided; and (2) made the ultimate division of the marital\r\n  estate inequitable.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe\r\n  laws of this state provide fifteen factors for the court to consider in\r\n  dividing and apportioning marital property. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp.\r\n  2007).Â  In dividing the marital estate the family court judge has wide\r\n  discretion, and the judgment of the family court will not be disturbed on\r\n  appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Â Craig, 365 S.C. at 290, 617\r\n  S.E.2d at 361; Wood v. Wood, 292 S.C. 43, 45, 354 S.E.2d 796, 798 (Ct. App. 1987); Gay v. Gay, 288 S.C. 74, 75, 339 S.E.2d 532, 533-34 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  marriages of significant length, this Court has approved â€œequal division as an\r\n  appropriate starting point for a family court judge [when] attempting to divide\r\n  an estate.â€ Doe v. Doe, 370 S.C. 206, 214, 634 S.E.2d 51, 56 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  However, â€œthere is certainly no recognized presumption in favor of a\r\n  fifty-fifty division.â€ Id.Â  As such, the discretion remains with the\r\n  family court judge to determine an appropriate division of the marital estate.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find it to be within the discretion of the family court judge to assign all or\r\n  part of marital debt to a party as a mechanism for achieving the desired\r\n  division of the marital estate.Â  Although such an assignment in this case\r\n  occasioned a 39% to 61% split of the estate in favor of the Wife, such a determination\r\n  is within the discretion of the family court.Â  See id. (ruling a\r\n  60% to 40% division to be equitable).Â Â  Furthermore, we note that a review of\r\n  the record indicates that Husband agreed to accept all of the marital debt.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we find the record supports the family courtâ€™s division of the marital estate\r\n  in this case.Â  It is irrelevant that this Court may have weighed particular\r\n  factors differently than the family court. See Green v. Green,\r\n  351 S.C. 329, 340, 569 S.E.2d 603, 604 (Ct. App. 1993). \r\nThe\r\n  family court did not abuse its discretion in assigning all the marital debt to\r\n  Husband.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, THOMAS,\r\n  and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  It appears\r\n  from the transcript that Wifeâ€™s trial counsel argued to the family court that\r\n  Husband was entitled to only a special equity in the Heathwood Drive residence;\r\n  however, the family court did not address this argument in the final order.Â \r\n  Wifeâ€™s post-trial motions were not included in the record on appeal, and this\r\n  Court requested copies of the motions from Wifeâ€™s appellate counsel.Â  There was\r\n  no mention in any of the materials submitted in response to the request about\r\n  the possibility of limiting Husbandâ€™s interest in the residence to a special\r\n  equity; therefore, we cannot consider such a possibility on appeal.Â  See Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (holding\r\n  the court of appeals improperly addressed an issue that the â€œcircuit court did\r\n  not explicitly rule onâ€ when the appellant did not raise the issue in a motion\r\n  to alter or amend).\r\n[3]Â  Although we have affirmed the appealed order based\r\n  on our own findings from our review of the evidence, we take this opportunity\r\n  to remind the family court bench that, under the South Carolina Rules of Family\r\n  Court, â€œ[a]n order or judgment pursuant to an adjudication in a domestic\r\n  relations case shall set forth the specific findings of fact and conclusions of\r\n  law to support the courtâ€™s decision.â€ Rule 26(a), SCRFC.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-009","title":"State v.

Holmes, 379 S.C. 468, 474-75, 666 S.E.2d 262, 265 (Ct.

Termination\r\n  of Fatherâ€™s Parental Rights\r\n1.Â \r\n  As to whether family court erred in\r\n  finding Father failed to remedy the conditions leading to his childrenâ€™s\r\n  removal: S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(2) (Supp. 2007)[1] (stating the family court may terminate parental rights when TPR is in the\r\n  childâ€™s best interests and the child has been removed from the parent and has\r\n  been out of the home for a period of six months following the adoption of a\r\n  placement plan by court order or by agreement between the department and the\r\n  parent, and the parent has not remedied the conditions which caused the\r\n  removal.); Depâ€™t of Soc.

Â§ 20-7-1572(4) (Supp. 2007) (Allowing the family court to terminate parental\r\n  rights when TPR is in the childâ€™s best interests and the child has lived\r\n  outside the home of either parent for a period of six months, and during that\r\n  time the parent has willfully failed to support the child); Charleston Co. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Jackson, 368 S.C. 87, 97, 627 S.E.2d 765, 771 (Ct. App. 2006)\r\n  (â€œWillful conduct is conduct that evinces a settled purpose to forego parental\r\n  duties . . . because it manifests a conscious indifference to the rights of the\r\n  child to receive support and consortium from the parent.â€).Â  \r\n3.Â \r\n  As to whether the family court erred in\r\n  terminating Fatherâ€™s parental rights based on the statutory ground that the\r\n  children were in foster care for fifteen of the past twenty-two months: S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(8) (Supp. 2007) (Allowing the family court to terminate\r\n  parental rights when TPR is in the childâ€™s best interests and the child has\r\n  been in foster care under the responsibility of the State for fifteen of the\r\n  most recent twenty-two months).Â Â Â  \r\n4.Â \r\n  As to whether the family\r\n  court erred in determining TPR was in childrenâ€™s best interests: S.C.

Griffith, III,\r\n          of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  The Milton P. Demetre Family Limited Partnership\r\n    (Demetre) appeals two orders of the master-in-equity.Â  Demetre argues the\r\n    master erred by determining the City of Folly Beach (Folly Beach) owned East Indian Avenue.Â  Demetre also argues the\r\n  master erred by dismissing his claims for declaratory judgment, decree to quiet\r\n  title, and an injunction and damages for trespass and nuisance.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nMost of the Island of Folly Beach, South\r\n  Carolina was platted and subdivided by the Jefferson Construction Company in\r\n  1920, and recorded in the Charleston County Register of Mesne Conveyance (RMC)\r\n  Office.Â  Subsequently, in 1965 the 1920 plat was redrawn because of\r\n  deterioration and in 1968 it was traced.Â  The redraw added parcels to the 1920\r\n  plat; however, the tracing appears to be identical to the 1920 plat.Â  All three\r\n  plats share the same book and page number at the RMC Office.\r\nBetween 1921 and 1925, the Folly Beach Improvement Company (FBIC)\r\n  acquired the entire island of Folly Beach and mortgaged its complete interest\r\n  to C &amp; S Bank.Â  In 1937, the FBIC sold &quot;all the streets, avenues,\r\n  and/or lanes in and upon Folly Island&quot; to the Board of Township Commission\r\n  of Folly Island for the use of the public.Â  In 1942, C &amp; S Bank foreclosed\r\n  on the mortgage and the land was bought by Edward Seabrook, Sr., at a public\r\n  auction.Â  The deed conveyed the island to Seabrook &quot;[s]aving and excepting\r\n  therefrom such lots and portions of land as have from time to time been\r\n  conveyed to sundry parties by [FBIC] by deeds recorded in the RMC Office for Charleston County.&quot;[1]Â  \r\nOn May 30, 2002, Demetre purchased from Seabrook, Jr., a &quot;portion\r\n  of [East Indian Avenue] that is undeveloped and unpaved&quot; bordering lots\r\n  201 to 205 for $10,000 by quitclaim deed (the Road).[2]Â  Both the 1920 plat and the 1968\r\n  redraw show a portion of East Indian Avenue extending from lot 201 to the\r\n  northwest corner of lot 205.Â  Prior to purchasing the Road, Demetre's realtor stated he had a conversation with the Folly\r\n  Beach mayor and city administrator in which they told him Folly Beach did not\r\n  own the Road and suggested Demetre talk to Seabrook, Jr.[3]Â \r\n  Subsequently, Folly Beach asserted ownership of the Road.Â  As a result, on\r\n  December 6, 2002, Demetre brought an action against Folly Beach to quiet title\r\n  in Road, which borders other property Demetre owns (the Road case).Â  Emily\r\n  Brown, who was allowed to intervene in the case, owns lot 204 on East Huron Avenue and has used the Road daily to access her property since January 30, 1986.\r\nOn January 23, 2004, Demetre bought two riverfront lots, 209 and\r\n  210, on East Indian Avenue from Seabrook, Jr., for $23,700 by quitclaim deed.Â  The\r\n  deed references the 1920 plat.Â  Demetre's lots are shown on the 1965 redraw,\r\n  but they do not appear on the 1920 plat or the Charleston County tax map.Â  When\r\n  Demetre purchased East Indian Avenue lots 209 and 210, two existing docks from East Huron Avenue lots 209 and 210 crossed over a portion of Demetre's lots to reach the water.Â \r\n  As a result, on October 7, 2005, Demetre brought an action against Annie\r\n  Crowley, Raymond Crowley, Donald Crowley, Harris Crowley, Jr., and Annie\r\n  Atkinson (the Crowleys),[4] and Harry and Patricia Beckmann (the Beckmanns) for declaratory judgment and to\r\n  quiet title to lots East Indian Avenue 209 and 210, where the Crowleys' and\r\n  Beckmanns' docks cross over the property (the Dock case).[5]Â  \r\nThe Crowleys purchased lot 210, East Huron Avenue, on September 1,\r\n  1964, and the Beckmanns purchased lot 209, East Huron Avenue, on April 27,\r\n  1972.Â  Both of their deeds referenced the 1920 plat, which shows no lots\r\n  between their lots and the marsh abutting the river.Â  The Crowleys and\r\n  Beckmanns both believed they owned all the property behind their homes down to\r\n  the marsh.Â  Beckmann testified he believed everything from his property line to\r\n  the Folly River was owned by the State.[6]Â \r\n  In 1988, both the Crowleys and the Beckmanns applied for permits from the South\r\n  Carolina Coastal Council (Council) to construct docks from their lots north to\r\n  the Folly River across East Indian Avenue lots 209 and 210.Â  Both permits were\r\n  granted by the Council and the docks were constructed; however, they were\r\n  destroyed by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and rebuilt in 1990.\r\nOn the\r\n  motion of the parties, these two cases were referred to a master-in-equity and\r\n  consolidated on August 21, 2006.Â  The cases were tried on December 12, 2006.Â \r\n  On March 2, 2007, the master issued the Road Order, finding the Road was\r\n  dedicated to the public and Folly Beach owned the Road.Â  On March 26, 2007, the\r\n  master issued the Dock Order, ruling in favor of the Crowleys and the Beckmanns\r\n  on all grounds.Â  Demetre timely filed Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motions in both cases,\r\n  which were denied.Â  Demetre then timely appealed both orders to this court and\r\n  we consolidated the appeals on September 13, 2007.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.Â \r\n  The Road Case\r\n\r\n  A.Â \r\n    Standard of Review\r\n\r\n&quot;The determination of whether a roadway has been\r\n  dedicated to the public is an action in equity.&quot;Â  Mack v. Edens,\r\n  320 S.C. 236, 239, 464 S.E.2d 124, 126 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  Therefore, we may find\r\n  the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence;\r\n  however, we are not required to disregard the findings of the trial judge who\r\n  saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position to judge their\r\n  credibility.Â  Cody Discount, Inc. v. Merritt, 368 S.C. 570, 574-75, 629\r\n  S.E.2d 697, 699 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\n\r\n  B.Â \r\n    DedicationÂ  \r\n\r\nDemetre\r\n  argues the master erred by finding Folly Beach accepted the dedication by\r\n  recording the deed.Â  We disagree.Â Â Â  \r\nDedication\r\n  requires two elements: (1) intent to dedicate and (2) acceptance of the\r\n  dedication.Â  Mack, 320 S.C. at 239, 464 S.E.2d at 126.Â  The intention of\r\n  an owner to dedicate his property to public use must be expressed in a positive\r\n  and unmistakable manner. Â Horry County v. Laychur, 315 S.C.\r\n  364, 368, 434 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1993).Â  &quot;It is generally held that when the\r\n  owner of land has it subdivided and platted into lots and streets and sells and\r\n  conveys the lots with reference to the plat, he thereby dedicates the streets\r\n  to the use of such lot owners, their successors in title, and the public.&quot;Â  Blue Ridge Realty Co. v. Williamson, 247 S.C. 112, 118, 145 S.E.2d 922,\r\n  924-25 (1965).Â  &quot;A recorded plat may be sufficient to disclose a landowner's\r\n  intent to dedicate property to public use.&quot;Â  Van Blarcum v. City of N. Myrtle Beach, 337 S.C. 446, 450, 523 S.E.2d 486, 488 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The burden of\r\n  proving intent to dedicate is on the party asserting dedication.Â  Shia v.\r\n    Pendergrass, 222 S.C. 342, 349, 72 S.E.2d 699, 702 (1952); Vick v. S.C.\r\n      Dep't of Transp., 347 S.C. 470, 477 n.2, 556 S.E.2d 693, 697 n.2 (Ct. App.\r\n  2001).Â  \r\nEvidence\r\n  of acceptance of a dedication must be by clear, convincing, and unequivocal\r\n  proof.Â  Vick, 347 S.C. at 477 n.2, 556 S.E.2d at 697 n.2.Â  An express or\r\n  implied public acceptance of the property offered for dedication must occur\r\n  within a reasonable time. Â Helsel v. City of N. Myrtle Beach, 307 S.C.\r\n  24, 27, 413 S.E.2d 821, 823 (1992).Â  An acceptance of an offer of dedication\r\n  may be implied by the public or the public authority's continuous use or\r\n  maintenance of the property in some fashion.Â  Boyd v. Hyatt, 294 S.C.\r\n  360, 365-66, 364 S.E.2d 478, 481 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  &quot;Acceptance of\r\n  dedication may be shown by use by a comparatively small number of persons, as\r\n  in the case of a short street to the seashore.&quot;Â  23 Am. Jur. 2d Dedication Â§ 50 (2002).Â  &quot;The public use need not be constant, but merely continuous\r\n  in light of the particular nature of the land.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Also, the\r\n  non-assessment of taxes is a factor in the determination of dedication and\r\n  acceptance.Â  Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 327, 487 S.E.2d\r\n  187, 192 (1997).\r\nThe\r\n  1937 deed from the FBIC to the Board of Township Commission of Folly Island\r\n  stated it was dedicating &quot;all the streets, avenues, and/or lanes in and\r\n  upon Folly Island&quot; for the use of the public, which was properly\r\n  recorded.Â  The foreclosure deed to Seabrook stated it was conveying to him the\r\n  land &quot;saving and excepting . . . such lots and portions of land as have\r\n  from time to time been conveyed to sundry parties by Folly Beach Corporation\r\n  and [FBIC] by deeds recorded in the RMC Office for Charleston County.&quot;Â \r\n  Also, the 1920 plat, which was referenced in Seabrook's deed, shows East Indian Avenue extending from lot 201 to the northwest corner of lot 205; and the Road\r\n  is not included on the tax map.Â  Furthermore, Seabrook's quitclaim deed to\r\n  Demetre references the 1920 plat.Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  evidence was presented at trial that the Road was paved at one time, and Folly\r\n  Beach filled in pot holes on the Road, sprayed the Road for mosquitoes, and removed\r\n  trees from the Road after Hurricane Hugo.Â  Brown also testified she and her\r\n  family have used the Road daily for twenty years to access her property and the\r\n  public uses the Road to park cars, jog, bike, and walk dogs.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  find the master correctly held the Road was dedicated to Folly Beach by deed\r\n  and plat, and Folly Beach accepted the dedication by using and maintaining the\r\n  Road.\r\n\r\n  C.Â \r\n    Equitable Estoppel\r\n\r\nDemetre\r\n  also argues the master erred by finding he did not satisfy the elements of\r\n  equitable estoppel.Â  We disagree. \r\n&quot;Government\r\n  agents, acting within the scope of their authority, can by their acts give rise\r\n  to estoppel against a municipality.&quot;Â  Landing Dev. Corp. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 285 S.C. 216, 221, 329 S.E.2d 423, 426 (1985).Â  Equitable estoppel is\r\n  found to exist when the following elements are present: \r\n\r\n  (1)\r\n    [C]onduct by the party estopped which amounts to a false representation or\r\n    concealment of material facts or which is calculated to convey the impression\r\n    that the facts are otherwise than and inconsistent with those which the party\r\n    subsequently attempts to assert; (2) the intention or at least expectation that\r\n    such conduct shall be acted upon by the other party; (3) knowledge, actual or\r\n    constructive, of the true facts; (4) lack of knowledge or the means of\r\n    knowledge of the facts by the other party; (5) reliance upon the conduct by the\r\n    other party; and (6) a detrimental change of position by the other party\r\n    because of his reliance.\r\n\r\nMcCrowey v. Zoning Bd. of\r\n  Adjustment of City of Rock Hill, 360\r\n  S.C. 301, 305, 599 S.E.2d 617, 619 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The burden of proof lies\r\n  with the party asserting an estoppel.Â  Pamplico Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.\r\n    Prosser, 262 S.C. 153, 159, 203 S.E.2d 110, 112 (1974).Â  \r\nDemetre\r\n  claims Folly Beach is estopped to repudiate its former interpretation of its\r\n  ownership of the Road because he and his agent lacked the knowledge or means to\r\n  know whether the city had formally or implicity accepted a dedication of the Road.Â \r\n  Demetre also claims his purchase of the property is evidence of his reliance\r\n  and detrimental change in position based on their statements.Â  However, Demetre\r\n  should have exercised further diligence in determining the true ownership of\r\n  the parcels instead of simply relying on the alleged statements of the mayor\r\n  and city administrator, especially because (1) there was initial confusion over\r\n  the Road's ownership, (2) Seabrook only gave Demetre a quitclaim deed, (3) the\r\n  price for the property was relatively inexpensive, and (4) the Road does not\r\n  appear on the tax map.Â  Therefore, we find the master correctly determined\r\n  Demetre did not satisfy the elements of equitable estoppel.Â Â Â  \r\nII.Â \r\n  The Dock Case\r\n\r\n  A.Â \r\n    Standard of Review\r\n\r\n&quot;A\r\n  suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined\r\n  by the nature of the underlying issue.&quot; Â Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991). Â &quot;To make this determination we\r\n  look to the main purpose of the action as determined by the complaint.&quot;Â  Estate\r\n    of Revis v. Revis, 326 S.C. 470, 476, 484 S.E.2d 112, 115 (Ct. App. 1997). Â When\r\n  &quot;the main purpose of the complaint concerns the determination of title to\r\n  real property, it is an action at law.&quot;Â  Query v. Burgess, 371 S.C.\r\n  407, 410, 639 S.E.2d 455, 456 (Ct. App. 2006); see also Wigfall v.\r\n    Fobbs, 295 S.C. 59, 60, 367 S.E.2d 156, 157 (1988) (&quot;The determination\r\n  of title to real property is a legal issue.&quot;). Â In an action at law tried\r\n  by the master alone, our review is limited to correcting errors of law and we\r\n  will affirm the master's factual findings if any evidence in the record reasonably\r\n  supports the findings. Â Lowcountry Open Land Trust v. State,\r\n  347 S.C. 96, 101-02, 552 S.E.2d 778, 781 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\n\r\n  B.Â  Ownership\r\n    of the Property\r\n\r\nDemetre\r\n  argues the master erred by failing to make a determination that he owned all\r\n  the property between the Crowleys' and the Beckmanns' lots and the mean high\r\n  water mark.\r\n&quot;Historically,\r\n  the State holds presumptive title to land below the high water mark.&quot;Â  McQueen\r\n    v. S.C. Coastal Council, 354 S.C. 142, 149, 580 S.E.2d 116, 119 (2003); Hilton\r\n      Head Plantation Prop. Owners' Ass'n, Inc. v. McDonald, 375 S.C. 220, 224,\r\n  651 S.E.2d 614, 616 (Ct. App. 2007); see also Hobonny Club, Inc. v.\r\n    McEachern, 272 S.C. 392, 396, 252 S.E.2d 133, 135 (1979) (&quot;This Court\r\n  has held that lands lying between the usual high water line and the usual low\r\n  water line on tidal navigable watercourses enjoy a special or unique status,\r\n  being held by the State in trust for public purposes.&quot;). Â &quot;One\r\n  asserting title to this land must prove a specific grant from the sovereign[,]\r\n  which is strictly construed against the grantee.&quot;Â  Coburg Dairy, Inc.\r\n    v. Lesser, 318 S.C. 510, 512, 458 S.E.2d 547, 548 (1995).Â  \r\nDemetre\r\n  sought a declaration that he owns all the property between the Crowleys' and\r\n  the Beckmanns' lots and the mean high water mark, and he sought to quiet any\r\n  defects in his title to the land.Â  The master did not rule on either request\r\n  and only held the Crowleys and the Beckmanns believed the State owned the land\r\n  when they applied for their dock permits, which does not resolve the question\r\n  of actual ownership.Â  Demetre does not dispute the presumption that the State holds\r\n  in trust for public purposes the property below the mean high water mark.Â  Therefore,\r\n  because the master failed to rule on Demetre's requests for a declaration of\r\n  ownership and to quiet title to the portions of the lots above the high water\r\n  mark, we remand this case to the master for a determination on this issue.\r\n\r\n  C.Â  Other Issues\r\n\r\nWe\r\n  need not address Demetre's remaining issues because we remand this case for a\r\n  determination on whether Demetre owns the land between the Crowleys' and the\r\n  Beckmanns' lots and the mean high water mark on lots 209 and 210 East Indian\r\n  Avenue.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nTherefore,\r\n  we affirm the master's March 2, 2007 order finding\r\n  Folly Beach owns East Indian Avenue and Demetre failed to satisfy the elements\r\n  of equitable estoppel.Â  However, we reverse the master's March 26, 2007 order\r\n  and remand for findings in accordance with this opinion.\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and SHORT and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Seabrook, Sr., and his wife, Fannie, conveyed\r\n  Seabrook's property to their son, Edward Seabrook, Jr., through the wills of\r\n  Seabrook, Sr., who died in 1956, and Fannie, who died in 1960.\r\n[2] Also, in 2002, Demetre bought lots 206 to 208 for\r\n  $45,000 from Seabrook, Jr.; lots 202 to 205 for $475,000 from another seller;\r\n  and &quot;any and all interest in marshland or highland north of lot 201 Indian\r\n  Avenue East&quot; for $5 from a third seller.\r\n[3] Demetre's realtor, Keith McCann, sent Demetre a\r\n  letter stating the Folly Beach mayor and city administrator had determined\r\n  Folly Beach did not own the Road.Â  He also stated the city officials suggested\r\n  Demetre talk to Seabrook, Jr., who then offered to sell the land to Demetre.Â \r\n  However, at trial, the\r\n  depositions of the mayor and city administrator were read into the record.Â \r\n  They both testified they did not remember telling Demetre or his realtor that\r\n  Folly Beach did not own the Road.Â  \r\n[4] Harris and Annie Crowley were the original owners of 210 East Huron Avenue; however, Harris died on April 26, 1995, leaving Annie Crowley with a\r\n  life estate in the property and a fifty percent remainder interest in the\r\n  property to Raymond Crowley, Donald Crowley, Harris Crowley, Jr., and Annie\r\n  Atkinson.Â  The new deed was dated August 15, 1996.Â  \r\n[5] The\r\n  Crowleys and Beckmanns were permitted to intervene in the Road case because the\r\n  rear of their lots abut East Indian Avenue.\r\n[6] In fact, Demetre's October 7, 2005 complaint states portions\r\n  of lots 209 and 210 on East Indian Avenue are &quot;located within the critical\r\n  area and; therefore, would require a permit for utilization from the South\r\n  Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control's Office of Ocean and\r\n  Coastal Management.&quot;\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-030","title":"Carmichael v.

Glenn Greene, Jr., of Dillon and Marian D.

Carmichael, d/b/a Lake View Gas Company\r\n  and Carmichael Farm Supply Co.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nCarmichael stated\r\n  in his complaint that on October 2, 1986, Odenâ€™s father, Jasper Page, Jr.,\r\n  executed and delivered to him a note for the amount of $50,585.05 with the\r\n  interest rate of 12% per annum secured by a mortgage on a 1.1 acre tract in\r\n  Dillon County.Â  The principal was to be repaid 10% a year for 10 years.Â  Page\r\n  transferred the property to Oden before his death on June 16, 2001.Â  Carmichael\r\n  filed this action to foreclose the mortgage on May 16, 2006, originally naming\r\n  as defendants Oden and Page or his heirs, personal representatives, successors,\r\n  assigns, spouses, creditors, and any other claiming a right to the property.Â  Carmichael amended his complaint on July 25, 2006 to name only Oden and her brothers,\r\n  Douglas Lee Page and David Carroll Page, as defendants. \r\nOn\r\n  July 27, 2006, Carmichael attempted to serve Oden through certified mail,\r\n  restricted delivery, return receipt at her address in Upper Marlboro, Maryland.Â  He also sent her the documents through regular mail.Â  The certified mail was\r\n  returned unclaimed, but the regular mail was not returned.Â  Carmichael also\r\n  attempted service through the Dillon County Sheriffâ€™s Department, but the\r\n  Sheriffâ€™s Department was unable to locate her.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  September 15, 2006, Carmichael filed a petition for an order of publication.Â \r\n  Attached to the petition was an affidavit of non-service by the sheriffâ€™s\r\n  deputy and an affidavit from Carmichaelâ€™s attorney detailing the attempts at\r\n  service.Â  The affidavit of Carmichaelâ€™s attorney was not notarized.Â  The Dillon\r\n  County Clerk of Court issued the order for publication that day.Â  The notice\r\n  appeared in The Dillon Herald on September 19, September 26, and October 3,\r\n  2006.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  November 7, 2006, Carmichael filed an affidavit of default.Â  The matter was\r\n  referred to the Master in Equity, who issued an order of default.Â  Carmichael\r\n  sent Oden notice of the hearing set for November 20, 2006 to her Maryland address.Â  On November 15, 2006, Oden requested the master recuse himself.Â  The\r\n  master granted the request and cancelled the hearing, which was rescheduled for\r\n  January 3, 2007.Â  Notice of the hearing was mailed to Oden on December 27,\r\n  2006.Â  On January 2, 2007, Oden filed a motion for continuance.Â  In the motion\r\n  her attorney stated that he had been retained on December 28, 2006 and would\r\n  like to have the opportunity to engage in discovery.Â  Oden also filed motions\r\n  to set aside entry of default and to dismiss.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the hearing, the trial court denied Odenâ€™s request for a continuance.Â  Although\r\n  Oden was not allowed to offer her own witnesses, she was able to cross-examine\r\n  Carmichael, the only witness, and to present evidence of a payment Page made in\r\n  1989.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  its written order, the trial court held the action was duly filed and served on\r\n  Oden.Â  The court found the issue of the statute of limitations did not involve\r\n  jurisdiction but rather was an affirmative defense which Oden had neither pled\r\n  nor proved.Â  It granted Oden a credit for $12,990.31 paid in 1989 and calculated\r\n  the debt with interest compounded annually at 12% to be $253,423.12. In\r\n  addition, the court added $5,000.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees and $609.61 in costs and\r\n  ordered foreclosure for this amount.Â  The court noted that Oden was not\r\n  personally liable for any deficiency and the judgment was solely against the\r\n  property.Â  Oden filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, which the court\r\n  denied.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Continuance\r\nOden\r\n  argues the trial court erred in denying her motion for a continuance.Â  Her\r\n  attorney was retained on December 28, 2006 and the hearing was held on January\r\n  3, 2007.Â  Her attorney stated he needed the time to engage in discovery and to\r\n  file any necessary motions.Â  The trial court believed the request for a continuance\r\n  was merely a ploy to delay the matter.Â  It noted Oden had already received a\r\n  continuance of the hearing scheduled November 20, 2006 when the master recused\r\n  himself at her request by order dated November 16, 2006.Â  Oden did not retain\r\n  counsel until almost a month and a half later.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  grant or denial of a continuance lies within the sound discretion of the trial\r\n  court, and its ruling will not be reversed absent a clear showing of abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  State v. Tanner, 299 S.C. 459, 462, 385 S.E.2d 832, 834\r\n  (1989). â€œMoreover, the denial of a motion for a continuance on the ground that\r\n  counsel has not had time to prepare is rarely disturbed on appeal.â€Â  Plyler\r\n    v. Burns, 373 S.C. 637, 650, 647 S.E.2d 188, 195 (2007).\r\nWe find the trial\r\n  court did not abuse its discretion in denying the continuance.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Denial of motion to set aside the\r\n  entry of default\r\nOden\r\n  argues the trial court erred in denying her motion to set aside the entry of\r\n  default.Â  She asserts several reasons why the trial court erred in finding the\r\n  notice by publication was proper.Â Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  Rule 55(c) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, a default may be set\r\n  aside â€œfor good cause shown.â€Â  â€œThe decision whether to grant relief from an\r\n  entry of default is solely within the sound discretion of the trial court.â€Â  Wham\r\n    v. Shearson Lehman Bros., 298 S.C. 462, 465, 381 S.E.2d 499, 501 (Ct. App.\r\n  1989).Â  \r\n1.&nbsp; Type of action for service by\r\n  publication\r\nOden\r\n  argues that because Carmichael knew her Maryland address, he should have\r\n  attempted to have a sheriff in the Maryland county of her residence serve\r\n  her.Â Â Â Â  Section 15-9-710 of the South Carolina Code provides for service by\r\n  publication when the person upon whom service is to be made cannot, after due\r\n  diligence, be found in this state and: \r\n\r\n\t(4) when the defendant is not a resident of this State\r\n  but has property therein and the court has jurisdiction of the subject of the\r\n  action;\r\n\t(5) when the subject of the action is real or personal\r\n  property in this State and the defendant has or claims a lien or interest,\r\n  actual or contingent, therein or the relief demanded consists wholly or partly\r\n  in excluding the defendant from any interest or lien therein . . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-9-710\r\n  (2005).Â  \r\nThis was an action\r\n  solely for foreclosure of a mortgage on property located in Dillon County,\r\n  South Carolina.Â  Accordingly, this is the type of case where service by\r\n  publication is authorized by statute.\r\n2.&nbsp; Location of newspaper in which\r\n  notice was published\r\nOden also claims\r\n  publication did not take place in the proper location. Section 15-9-740 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code provides for the order of publication to direct publication\r\n  to be made in the newspaper â€œmost likely to give notice to the person to be\r\n  served . . . .â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-9-740 (2005).Â  Oden asserts the notice\r\n  should have been published in Upper Marlboro, Maryland.Â  However, when\r\n  Carmichael attempted to serve her at her address in Maryland through certified\r\n  mail, the letter was returned unclaimed.Â  The order of publication provides Oden\r\n  could not be located in Dillon County, South Carolina, or her last known\r\n  address.Â  As Oden could not be located at her Maryland address, we find it was\r\n  within the trial courtâ€™s discretion to find that the newspaper in Dillon County,\r\n  where it was known Oden owned property, was the one â€œmost likely to give\r\n  noticeâ€ to Oden.Â  Accordingly, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s ruling\r\n  that the notice by publication in Dillon County was proper.Â  Â \r\n3.&nbsp; Affidavits to support order of\r\n  publication\r\nOden\r\n  asserts Carmichael did not provide affidavits sufficient to support an order of\r\n  publication.Â  Section 15-9-710 of the South Carolina Code provides for service\r\n  by publication:\r\n\r\n\tWhen\r\n  the person on whom the service of the summons is to be made cannot, after due\r\n  diligence, be found within the State and (a) that fact appears by affidavit to\r\n  the satisfaction of the court or judge thereof, the clerk of the court of\r\n  common pleas, the master, or the probate judge of the county in which the cause\r\n  is pending and (b) it in like manner appears that a cause of action exists\r\n  against the defendant in respect to whom the service is to be made or that he\r\n  is a proper party to an action relating to real property in this State . . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-9-710\r\n  (2005).Â  \r\nThus,\r\n  in order to obtain an order for service by publication, Carmichael had to\r\n  establish by affidavit that after searching with due diligence, neither he nor\r\n  anyone on his behalf was able to locate Oden within this State and that Oden\r\n  was a proper party to an action relating to real property in this State.Â  â€œGenerally,\r\n  absent fraud or collusion, once the issuing officer is satisfied with the\r\n  supporting affidavit, the decision to order service by publication is final\r\n  unless the order of publication is premised upon a facially defective\r\n  affidavit.â€Â  Brown v. Malloy, 345 S.C. 113, 118, 546 S.E.2d 195, 197\r\n  (Ct. App. 2001); see Miles v. Lee, 319 S.C. 271, 274, 460 S.E.2d\r\n  423, 425 (Ct. App. 1995) (finding the affidavit supporting publication was\r\n  facially defective because it purported to show due diligence in ascertaining\r\n  the whereabouts of someone other than the person to be served).\r\nOden\r\n  argues the trial court erred in denying the motion to set aside the entry of\r\n  default because the affidavit of publication was facially defective in the\r\n  following ways:Â  a) the document was not notarized, b) the document does not\r\n  state that Oden owned property in South Carolina, c) the document does not\r\n  state the nature of the action against Oden, d) the unclaimed letter sent by\r\n  certified mail was not filed in the office of the Clerk of Court, and e) the\r\n  Sheriffâ€™s Deputyâ€™s affidavit of non-service misspelled Odenâ€™s first name.Â  \r\nCarmichael acknowledges his attorneyâ€™s affidavit requesting\r\n  publication was not notarized.Â  He asserts the fact that the statements were\r\n  made â€œas Attorney for the Plaintiff and an Officer of the Courtâ€ should suffice\r\n  to satisfy the requirement of the statute.Â  However, the supreme court noted\r\n  that a sworn statement from an attorney did not comply with South Carolinaâ€™s\r\n  requirements for a valid affidavit because it was not notarized.Â  Black v.\r\n    Lexington Sch. Dist. No. 2, 327 S.C. 55, 58, 488 S.E.2d 327, 328 (1997); but\r\n      see S.C. Ins. Co. v. Barlow, 301 S.C. 502, 508, 392 S.E.2d 795, 798\r\n  (Ct. App. 1990) (excusing failure to have notarized Department of\r\n  Transportation officerâ€™s signature on Form FR-9 because to hold otherwise would\r\n  amount to a sacrifice of substance to form).Â  \r\nâ€œUnder the plain\r\n  meaning rule, it is not the courtâ€™s place to change the meaning of a clear and\r\n  unambiguous statute.â€Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d\r\n  578, 581 (2000).Â Â  Section 15-9-710 clearly requires an affidavit.Â  Carmichaelâ€™s attorneyâ€™s statement does not fulfill this requirement.Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  Carmichael attached to his petition for service by publication the affidavit of\r\n  Ken Rogers, the Deputy Sheriff for Dillon County, in which Rogers represented\r\n  he had not been able to find â€œBenita Joyce Page Odenâ€ after diligent efforts to\r\n  find her.Â  Oden states this affidavit is defective because it misspells her\r\n  first name, which is Bonita, not Benita.Â  \r\nIn Miles\r\n  v. Lee the affidavit supporting publication in an adoption/termination of\r\n  parental rights action stated that after due diligence â€œKenneth Wayne Leeâ€\r\n  could not be found in this state.Â  The father, whose name was â€œRobert Lewis\r\n  Miles,â€ was the actual defendant and was not named in the affidavit.Â  Miles\r\n    v. Lee, 319 S.C. at 273, 460 S.E.2d at 424.Â  This court held the affidavit\r\n  was facially defective and thus the order of publication was not supported by a\r\n  sufficient affidavit.Â  Id. at 274, 460 S.E.2d at 425.\r\nHere,\r\n  Odenâ€™s first name is spelled Benita in all of the pleadings.Â Â Â  We find the\r\n  trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing this affidavit to support\r\n  the order of publication.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  order of publication in this case also must be supported by an affidavit\r\n  showing Oden was a proper party to an action relating to real property in this\r\n  State.Â  Carmichael asserts the affidavit of verification of the complaint in\r\n  this action satisfied this requirement.Â  A verified complaint is an acceptable\r\n  substitute for an affidavit at the summary judgment phase.Â  Dawkins v.\r\n    Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 67, 580 S.E.2d 433, 438 (2003).Â  The supreme court\r\n  recognized that a verified complaint may augment an affidavit for the purpose\r\n  of furnishing the grounds for issuing a warrant of attachment and in\r\n  proceedings for claim and delivery.Â  Plowden v. Mack, 217 S.C. 226, 232,\r\n  60 S.E.2d 311, 314 (1950).Â Â  While the court recognized the remedy of\r\n  attachment was a drastic one and the provisions of the code relating to it must\r\n  be strictly followed and adhered to, it held a verified complaint will take the\r\n  place of the affidavit required by the statute.Â  Biltrite Bldg. Co v. Adams,\r\n  193 S.C. 142, 150, 7 S.E.2d 857, 860 (1940).\r\nWe\r\n  find the verified complaint could be used in the place of the affidavit\r\n  required by section 15-9-710.Â  Accordingly we find the trial court did not\r\n  abuse its discretion in finding the order of publication was properly supported\r\n  by affidavits.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in holding that service by\r\n  publication was proper, we conclude the court did not err in denying the motion\r\n  for relief from default judgment.Â  \r\n4.\r\n  Timeliness of service\r\nOden\r\n  argues the publication of the summons did not take place within a reasonable\r\n  time pursuant to the Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  She cites to Rule 3(b), SCRCP,\r\n  which provides for tolling of the statute of limitations when after filing, the\r\n  pleadings are delivered to the sheriff of the county where the defendant was\r\n  known to last reside for service upon the defendant, provided actual service\r\n  occurs within a reasonable time thereafter. \r\nThis\r\n  rule is only applicable to the tolling of the statute of limitations.Â  While\r\n  delivery of the pleadings to the Dillon County Sheriff may not have tolled the\r\n  statute, we find no error by the trial court because, as discussed below, the\r\n  statute of limitations still has not run.\r\nIII.Â \r\n  Failure to join necessary party.Â  \r\nOden\r\n  asserts the court should have granted her motion to dismiss because Carmichael failed to name Page as a party to this action.Â  A motion under Rule 12(b)(7) is\r\n  proper where a necessary party under Rule 19 should be joined for a just\r\n  adjudication of the issues.Â  BancOhio Natâ€™l Bank v. Neville, 310 S.C.\r\n  323, 326, 426 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1993).Â  â€œThe rule provides an affirmative\r\n  defense for the failure to join any interested party who is subject to service\r\n  of process, and who will not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject\r\n  matter under Rule 19, SCRCP.â€\r\nPage\r\n  is deceased.Â  Carmichael did not seek a judgment against his estate.Â  Instead,\r\n  he only sought foreclosure of the mortgage on property that Page deeded to Oden\r\n  before his death.Â  Accordingly, Page was not a necessary party to this action.Â  \r\nIV.Â \r\n  Statute of limitations\r\nOden argues the\r\n  statute of limitations bars this action.Â  She asserts that because the debt\r\n  preexisted the mortgage, the time for the statute to run began in 1985, before\r\n  the mortgage was executed on October 2, 1986.Â  In the alternative, she\r\n  maintains that when considering the date on the mortgage, the action must have\r\n  been commenced on or before October 2, 2006 and service by publication was not\r\n  complete until October 3, 2006. \r\nFirst, â€œ[t]he\r\n  failure to plead an affirmative defense is deemed a waiver of the right to\r\n  assert it.â€Â  Whitehead v. State, 352 S.C. 215, 220, 574 S.E.2d 200, 202\r\n  (2002).Â  Â Oden has not filed an answer in this matter and has waived the right\r\n  to assert the affirmative defense of statute of limitations.Â  In addition, the\r\n  statute has not run in this matter.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\tSection\r\n  29-1-10 of the South Carolina Code provides:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tNo\r\n  mortgage or deed having the effect of a mortgage or other lien shall constitute\r\n  a lien upon any real estate after the lapse of twenty years from the date for\r\n  the maturity of the lien. However, if the holder of the lien shall, at any time\r\n  during the continuance of the lien, cause to be recorded upon the record of\r\n  that mortgage or deed having the effect of a mortgage or other lien a note of\r\n  some payment on account or some written acknowledgment of the debt secured\r\n  thereby, with the date of the payment or acknowledgment, the mortgage or deed\r\n  having the effect of a mortgage or other lien shall be, and shall continue to\r\n  be, a lien for twenty years from the date of the record of that payment on\r\n  account or acknowledgment. When there is no maturity stated or fixed in the\r\n  mortgage or the record of the mortgage, then the provisions hereof are\r\n  applicable from the date of that mortgage and that mortgage shall not\r\n  constitute a lien after the lapse of twenty years from the date thereof.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-1-10\r\n  (2007).Â  \r\nThe statute did not\r\n  begin to run until the date of the maturity of the mortgage.Â  Carmichael\r\n  testified that under the terms of the mortgage, Page was to pay ten percent of\r\n  the debt annually for ten years.Â  The mortgage, therefore, did not mature until\r\n  October 2, 1996. This action was brought well within the twenty year-statute.\r\n  In addition, Oden presented evidence that Page made a payment on the mortgage\r\n  in 1989 and the trial court calculated this payment in determining the amount\r\n  of the debt.Â  Oden acknowledged in her brief that the statute of limitations\r\n  would run twenty years from the last payment.Â Â  Accordingly, the statute of limitations\r\n  does not bar Carmichaelâ€™s action.[2] Â \r\nV.&nbsp; Failure to allow Oden to testify\r\nOden\r\n  asserts the trial court erred in failing to allow her or her brother to\r\n  testify.Â  First, it does not appear Oden requested to testify at the hearing.Â \r\n  Thus, this issue is not properly before the court.Â  See Wilder Corp.\r\n    v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic\r\n  that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been\r\n  raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate\r\n  review.â€).Â  Further, the record does not show what this testimony might have\r\n  been.Â  SeeÂ  State v. King, 367 S.C. 131, 136, 623 S.E.2d 865, 868\r\n  (Ct. App. 2005) (stating a reviewing court may not consider error alleged in\r\n  the exclusion of testimony unless the record on appeal shows fairly what the\r\n  rejected testimony would have been).Â  Accordingly, the issue is not properly\r\n  before this court.Â  \r\nVI.&nbsp; Validity of mortgage\r\nOden\r\n  asserts Carmichael failed to establish he held a valid mortgage.Â  She claims\r\n  the mortgage did not secure a specific debt.Â  Carmichael testified, without\r\n  objection, that prior to the mortgage he sold fertilizer, LP gas, and gasoline\r\n  to Page on credit.Â  He then required Page to execute a mortgage for the debt\r\n  amount. Thus, there is a specific debt secured by the mortgage.Â  \r\nOden\r\n  also argues there was no testimony that the mortgage was validly executed.Â  She\r\n  also complains there was no testimony as to the amount of the mortgage.Â  Carmichael did not testify as to this exact amount but said the debt was around $50,000.Â  In\r\n  addition, the verified complaint lists the original debt amount as $50,585.05.Â \r\n  As Oden was in default, all of the allegations in the complaint, including the\r\n  validity of the mortgage and the amount of the mortgage amount, are admitted.Â  See State ex rel. Medlock v. Love Shop, Ltd., 286 S.C. 486, 488, 334 S.E.2d\r\n  528, 530 (Ct. App. 1985) (stating an entry of an order of default is an\r\n  admission by the defaulting party of the well-pleaded allegations of the complaint).Â  \r\nOden\r\n  states the judgment in favor of Carmichael was improper because he never\r\n  introduced documents into the record.Â  Carmichael testified that he could not\r\n  find the original note and mortgage.Â  In the order on Carmichaelâ€™s motion to\r\n  alter or amend, the trial court noted â€œ[t]hat the mortgage on record in the\r\n  clerkâ€™s office, which [Odenâ€™s] own evidence referred to and presented evidence\r\n  in the subordination agreement, was clear as to the terms of the agreement so\r\n  that no original note and mortgage was necessary.â€Â  In addition, Carmichael testified as to the terms of the mortgage without objection.Â  â€œEvidence received\r\n  without objection is competent.â€Â  Toyota of Florence v. Lynch,\r\n  314 S.C. 257, 266, 442 S.E.2d 611, 616 (1994).Â  \r\nOden argues the fact Carmichael does not have the\r\n  mortgage could be evidence that the mortgage had been satisfied and cancelled.Â \r\n  This issue was neither raised to nor ruled on by the trial court.Â  See\r\n    Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is\r\n  axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must\r\n  have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for\r\n  appellate review.â€).Â  Accordingly, there is no error on this issue.Â  \r\nVII.Â \r\n  Calculation of interest\r\nOden\r\n  argues the trial court erred in allowing Carmichael to testify to his\r\n  reasonable belief about the amount owed on the mortgage without any supporting\r\n  calculation.Â  Carmichael testified he had a bank employee calculate the\r\n  interest on the mortgage and then, over Odenâ€™s hearsay objection, stated that\r\n  amount.Â  The trial court, however, clearly made its own calculation of the\r\n  total debt owed as it allowed for credit for the 1989 payment of $12,990.31.Â \r\n  Accordingly, even if there was any error in allowing Carmichaelâ€™s testimony, it\r\n  was harmless.Â  See JKT Co. v. Hardwick, 274 S.C. 413, 419, 265 \r\nS.E.2d 510, 513 (1980) (stating an error not shown to be prejudicial does not \r\nconstitute grounds for reversal).\r\nVIII.Â \r\n  Usury\r\nOden\r\n  asserts that the amount of interest Carmichael sought was usurious and\r\n  therefore Carmichael forfeited all interests and costs.Â  â€œUnconscionability has\r\n  been recognized as the absence of meaningful choice on the part of one party\r\n  due to one-sided contract provisions, together with terms which are so\r\n  oppressive that no reasonable person would make them and no fair and honest\r\n  person would accept them.â€ Â Jones Leasing v. Gene Phillips &amp; Assocs.,\r\n  282 S.C. 327, 331, 318 S.E.2d 31, 33 (Ct. App. 1984). The mortgage called for\r\n  the debt to accrue interest at the rate of 12% compounded annually.Â  Although\r\n  due to the passage of time, the debt has increased substantially, the\r\n  transaction was not oppressive.Â  We find no error in the trial courtâ€™s ruling.\r\nIX.Â \r\n  Attorneyâ€™s fees\r\nOden\r\n  argues the trial court erred in granting Carmichael attorneyâ€™s fees because\r\n  there was no evidence regarding the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Although Oden\r\n  did object to the court granting attorneyâ€™s fees in her motion to alter or\r\n  amend, the basis for this objection was â€œPlaintiff did not request attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees at trial.â€ Carmichael did request attorneyâ€™s fees in the complaint.Â  Thus,\r\n  the trial court did not err denying Odenâ€™s motion to alter or amend on this\r\n  issue.Â  Oden never objected to the amount of the fees or the basis for the\r\n  award until appeal. This issue is not properly before this court.Â  See Durham\r\n    v. Vinson, 360 S.C. 639, 654, 602 S.E.2d 760, 767 (2004) (party may not\r\n  argue one ground for objection at trial and another ground on appeal).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON,\r\n  HUFF, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Although the pleadings and order in this case list Odenâ€™s first name as Benita,\r\n  she claims her name is actually Bonita. \r\n[2] See Iâ€™On v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d\r\n  716, 723 (2000) (stating an appellate court may affirm for any reason appearing\r\n  in the record).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-031","title":"State v.

Phillips and Richard Kevin Phillips appeal\r\n  the order of the trial court granting summary judgment to Horry County.Â  They assert the trial court erred in holding the federal courtâ€™s finding of probable\r\n  cause in their 42 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1983 (2000) claim collaterally estopped them from\r\n  claiming a lack of probable cause in their remanded state law claims for\r\n  malicious prosecution, false imprisonment, and assault and battery.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  action arises from the Phillipsâ€™ arrest by Horry County law enforcement officer\r\n  Kevin Jordan for breach of peace.Â  The charge against Mrs. Phillips was later dismissed.Â \r\n  The charge against Mr. Phillips was also dismissed after he performed community\r\n  service.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Phillips brought separate actions against Horry County and Officer Jordan for\r\n  assault and battery, malicious prosecution, false imprisonment, and violation\r\n  of the civil rights under color of state law pursuant to 42 U.S.C.A Â§ 1983.Â \r\n  The defendants removed the action to federal court on the basis of federal\r\n  question jurisdiction.Â  The federal court granted the defendantsâ€™ summary\r\n  judgment finding, among other issues, that the officers had probable cause to\r\n  arrest the Phillips and did not use excessive force.Â  It declined to exercise\r\n  supplemental jurisdiction of the remaining state law claims and remanded the\r\n  case to the Court of Common Pleas for Horry County.Â  The circuit court held\r\n  that because the issues of probable cause and reasonable force had already been\r\n  fully and fairly litigated in federal court and the Phillips had presented no\r\n  additional evidence, they were precluded from relitigating the issues.Â  It held\r\n  summary judgment was appropriate as the determination of those issues\r\n  foreclosed the Phillipsâ€™ claims for assault and battery, false imprisonment,\r\n  and malicious prosecution.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, the Phillips assert for the first time that the circuit court\r\n  mistakenly applied the federal test required by Â§ 1983 for â€œarguable probable\r\n  causeâ€ while our state law requires â€œprobable cause in fact.â€Â  As this argument\r\n  was neither raised to nor ruled on by the circuit court, it is not properly\r\n  before this court.Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d\r\n  731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first\r\n  time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge\r\n  to be preserved for appellate review.â€).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  their reply brief, the Phillips argue the circuit court erred in granting\r\n  summary judgment because it:\r\n\r\n\t(1)\r\n  adopted the federal test or standard for granting summary judgment in the\r\n  applicable state law claims, (2) applied a subjective test, instead of an\r\n  objective test, to determine whether the arresting officer had probable cause\r\n  to arrest, (3) ignored the South Carolina â€œminorityâ€ rule that probable cause\r\n  is ordinarily a question of fact for the jury, (4) ignored the issue that the\r\n  appellants were arrested in their home which requires a higher standard of\r\n  probable cause, (5) ignored several genuine issues of material fact and\r\n  apparently viewed the evidence in the light most favorable to the Respondents,\r\n  and finally (6) ignored issues bearing on the credibility of the witness.Â  \r\n\r\nFrom\r\n  the record before the court, we cannot discern whether any of these issues were\r\n  raised to or ruled upon by the circuit court.Â  See Wilder Corp. v.\r\n    Wilke, 330 S.C. at 76, 497 S.E.2d at 733 (1998) (stating an issue cannot be\r\n  raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled\r\n  upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review); Enriquez v.\r\n    S.C. Depâ€™t of Corrections, 374 S.C. 165, 167, 648 S.E.2d 582, 583 (2007)\r\n  (appellant has the burden to provide an adequate record for review);Â  Shealy\r\n    v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 460, 535 S.E.2d 438, 444-45 (2000) (trial\r\n  courtâ€™s general ruling insufficient to preserve specific issue for appellate\r\n  review; where trial court does not explicitly rule on argument raised, and no\r\n  Rule 59 motion filed, appellate court may not address the issue); Grant v.\r\n    S.C. Coastal Council, 319 S.C. 348, 355-56, 461 S.E.2d 388, 392 (1995)\r\n  (finding that an inaccuracy in the trial courtâ€™s order must be raised to the\r\n  trial court by way of a motion to alter or amend a judgment before the\r\n  inaccuracy may be challenged on appeal).Â  Furthermore, many of these arguments\r\n  were raised for the first time in the reply brief.

(Horne) appeals from a jury verdict finding\r\n  Retail Properties, Inc. (RPI) entitled to damages of $132,813 for Horneâ€™s\r\n  breach of its contract with RPI.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThis matter involves an admitted contract between RPI and Horne,\r\n  wherein RPI agreed to represent Horne as a preferred grocery-anchored shopping\r\n  center developer in certain South Carolina counties.Â  RPI sued Horne after\r\n  Horne failed to pay RPI under the contract for site acquisition services\r\n  rendered after Horne developed a Publix at the intersection of Broad River Road and Kennerly Street in Columbia.Â  \r\nRPI is a company formed by Tim Metzler that specializes in tenant\r\n  selection. Metzler had previously worked for a company which developed large\r\n  shopping centers, such as Wal-Mart.Â  When Metzler left employment with that\r\n  company, multiple clients, including Publix Super Markets, requested Metzler\r\n  continue to represent them.Â  Metzler testified these chains would engage tenant\r\n  representation firms to explain the nuances of the market, traffic patterns,\r\n  and demographics and come up with a strategy for possible markets.Â  Metzler\r\n  stated the tenant representation role is different from a broker, who\r\n  represents the buyer or the seller in a transaction.Â  A tenant representation\r\n  firm educates the tenant on where to go; they help create a plan, they create\r\n  the submarkets, and they find opportunities.Â  \r\nPublix engaged RPI to initiate the move of Publix stores into South Carolina.Â  As part of this representation, Publix asked RPI to interface with fifteen\r\n  or twenty different developers over time.Â  Based on longstanding relationships\r\n  with developers, Publix may request the tenant representation firm work with\r\n  particular developers.Â  In 2000, Publix requested RPI expand its areas of\r\n  responsibility into Columbia and five counties in the Upstate.Â Â Â  After driving\r\n  around Columbia, Publixâ€™s real estate manager, Bob Burkett, and Metzler\r\n  identified five market opportunities.Â  At that time one of those developers,\r\n  Horne, was soliciting business from Publix.Â  Based on a relationship Burkett\r\n  had with William Hanks, a real estate manager for Horne, Burkett asked that RPI\r\n  work with Horne when an opportunity arose.Â  Once Metzler, Burkett and Hanks\r\n  identified some specific intersections of interest, the president of Horne,\r\n  Richard Pressley, joined them in looking at the Columbia and Upstate areas.Â \r\n  According to Metzler, this business relationship ultimately resulted in RPI and\r\n  Horne entering into a Fee Schedule agreement on March 2, 2000.Â  \r\n\r\n\tThe agreement between RPI and Horne provided as follows:\r\n\r\nRetail Properties, Inc. and Horne Properties\r\nFee Schedule\r\n\r\n\tRetail Properties, Inc. (RPI) agrees to represent Horne Properties\r\n  as a preferred grocery-anchored shopping center developer in the following South Carolina counties:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tRichland&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t\tAnderson\r\n\t\t\t\tGreenville\r\n\t\t\t\tPickens\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLexington\r\n\t\t\t\tCherokee\r\n\t\t\t\tSpartanburg\r\n\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tRetail Propertiesâ€™ assignment is to assist Publix Super Markets in\r\n  improving their market share in the above markets.Â  Whenever there is an\r\n  opportunity for a developer to be involved in a shopping center, it will be\r\n  presented to Horne Properties.Â  As consideration for being a preferred shopping\r\n  center developer, Horne Properties agrees to the following compensation\r\n  agreement for RPI.\r\n\tSite Acquisition\r\n\tFor each property purchased, a fee of $3.00 per sq. ft. on Publix\r\n  GLA to be paid to RPI by the Seller and/or the Buyer at closing.\r\n\r\nThe document\r\n  originally submitted by RPI to Horne contained additional services RPI could\r\n  offer to Horne in exchange for additional fees and commissions, including\r\n  assisting Horne with any joint ventures, Publix leases, and additional tenant\r\n  leases.Â  However, these optional services were not desired by Horne and, as a\r\n  result, the parties struck through all of these other services.Â  The document\r\n  also originally provided under the site acquisition that RPI be compensated â€œa\r\n  fee of 5% to be paid by the Seller and/or Buyer at closing with a $75,000\r\n  guaranteed minimum per single transaction and $100,000 guaranteed minimum per\r\n  assemblage transaction,â€ but this language was modified to provide for the $3\r\n  per square foot of gross leasable area compensation, an industry standard.Â  Thus,\r\n  the compensation for site acquisition work â€œwent from a percentage to a flat\r\n  fee.â€Â  Additionally, language under the site acquisition proposal providing\r\n  Horne would â€œguarantee a minimum fee of 2% of the purchase price to be paid to\r\n  RPIâ€ for the sale/purchase of shopping centers was struck through by the\r\n  parties.Â Â Â  Pressleyâ€™s instructions to Metzler were â€œto go find dirtâ€ that\r\n  Horne could own and Horne was going to â€œdevelop it from the ground up.â€Â  \r\nWorking under this agreement, Metzler testified RPIâ€™s task with regard to site selection was to\r\n  identify submarkets, further identify intersections, to help in a site\r\n  selection process and, once everyone was in agreement on the site selection for\r\n  a possible Publix, to go find the next site.Â  As site selector, RPI was to\r\n  present all available opportunities to Horne and if the opportunities could be\r\n  developed, assist them in the process.Â  Once an agreement was reached on site\r\n  selection, Horne was responsible for continuing on the path to erect a Publix.Â \r\n  According to Metzler, RPI was to be compensated under the agreement â€œif we\r\n  complete a site acquisition and identify a site.â€Â  In order to complete the\r\n  site acquisition, RPI would â€œfilter all the information,â€ â€œgo down to the\r\n  intersection,â€ â€œdo the work on the submarket,â€ and if Publix agrees to locate\r\n  at that site, RPI would provide introductions to all the property owners.Â \r\n  Metzler testified, â€œ[O]nce the initial meetings are completed we are out of the\r\n  picture, and on to the next site.â€Â  To achieve the final site acquisition, the\r\n  developer would contract for the property and build a shopping center.Â  As a\r\n  site selector, RPI would not be involved in the development of the property.Â  \r\nIn regard to the property that is the center of this dispute,\r\n  Metzler and Burkett narrowed their search down from a submarket in the area to\r\n  the particular intersection of Broad River and Kennerly.Â  At this time, RPI was\r\n  under its agreement with Horne. The northwest corner was listed by the\r\n  company Edens &amp; Avant.Â  Metzler began to contact the owners of property on\r\n  the northeast corner and discovered another developer, Joe Gentry, had title to\r\n  one small parcel and held options to purchase all the other properties\r\n  necessary for development of that corner.Â  At the instruction of Publix and\r\n  Horne, Metzler approached Gentry with the opportunity to sell the property to\r\n  Horne at a profit, but Gentry declined because he wanted to develop the\r\n  property for Publix himself.Â  Publix instructed RPI to get both sides of\r\n  property under contract so that both developers could present packages to\r\n  Publix.Â  RPI then provided its full packet of information and research on the\r\n  area to both developers.Â  The packages were submitted to Burkett, and he chose\r\n  to present the northeast corner that Gentry had under contract for\r\n  consideration by Publix.Â  Metzler testified that in 2000, an opportunity\r\n  existed for Horne on the northwest corner, but there was no opportunity at that\r\n  time for Horne as to the northeast corner that Gentry had under his control.Â \r\n  Both of the packages were ultimately rejected by Publix.Â  \r\nPublix has a written rule whereby no one is allowed to resubmit a\r\n  property site for consideration for at least one year.Â Â  In the spring of 2001,\r\n  Philip Greenwall with Publix began traveling with Metzler in South Carolina and\r\n  reviewed the areas looked into previously by Burkett and Metzler.Â  While\r\n  looking at the northwest corner of Broad River and Kennerly that had been\r\n  submitted again by a different developer, Greenwall indicated he liked the\r\n  northeast corner better.Â  Greenwall suggested RPI get Horne involved in the\r\n  northeast corner, so Metzler contacted Hanks and Pressley, who then instructed\r\n  RPI to go back to the northeast corner and contact the property owners.Â  By\r\n  this time, Gentry had dropped his options on the northeast corner.Â  Metzler\r\n  contacted all of the property owners, who directed him to Tom Efland, one of\r\n  the owners who was also acting as a representative for the other property\r\n  owners.Â  \r\nAt the instruction of Hanks and Pressley, Metzler made arrangements\r\n  for a meeting with Horne and Efland.Â Â Â  Metzler, Hanks and Pressley met with\r\n  Efland at his office on July 11, 2001 and discussed the site, terms and\r\n  conditions, and the possibility of putting the northeast corner under contract\r\n  with Horne.Â Â  After the meeting, Metzler was told his work was finished on that\r\n  job, that Horne would handle the negotiations with the property owners, and\r\n  that RPI would be compensated. Pressley and Hanks then instructed Metzler to\r\n  move onto another site in the Upstate.Â  \r\nApproximately two months later, Horne sent RPI a termination\r\n  letter dated September 13, 2001, stating it had come to Horneâ€™s attention RPI\r\n  was representing other developers in the seven counties listed in the agreement\r\n  and, because of this conflict of interest, Horne was terminating their\r\n  agreement.Â  Metzler testified, while Horne was free to terminate the agreement\r\n  at any time, RPI made full disclosure to Horne that it worked with other\r\n  developers, sending out periodic reports which included information regarding\r\n  RPIâ€™s work with all the developers.Â  Horne entered into a contract with Efland\r\n  for his piece of property on September 25, 2001.Â Â Â  Ultimately, of the several\r\n  projects on which RPI worked, Horne closed on two properties after the\r\n  termination letter, including the northeast corner of Broad River and\r\n  Kennerly.Â  While Horne paid RPI for the other project, it refused to pay on the\r\n  Broad River and Kennerly one.Â  RPI presented evidence the gross leasable square\r\n  footage of the Publix Horne subsequently developed at this location was\r\n  44,271.Â  \r\nPressley, testifying on behalf of Horne, maintained RPIâ€™s duties\r\n  under the agreement were to negotiate land contracts and help their personnel\r\n  produce market data and trade area statistics, including population, household\r\n  income, income per capita, new housing starts, current housing and schools.Â \r\n  Pressley stated Horne terminated its agreement with RPI because (1) RPI was\r\n  working in the same market with other grocers, thereby potentially jeopardizing\r\n  a relationship with Publix, (2) RPI had â€œother competitive developer\r\n  relationships,â€ and (3) RPI failed to pursue the land contracts to the degree\r\n  Horne had originally hoped.Â Â  Pressley testified to the various meetings and\r\n  negotiations Horne had with the different landowners in regard to the northeast\r\n  corner property.Â Â  He did not recall any meeting with Efland where Metzler was\r\n  present.Â  Contracts were negotiated on the various properties in question for a\r\n  period of around eight months, starting in late September 2001.Â Â  Pressley\r\n  testified, had RPI still been representing Horne during that time, Horne would\r\n  have expected RPI to be involved with these negotiations and execution of the\r\n  contracts.Â  A Publix grocery store was subsequently constructed on the property\r\n  and opened in November or December 2003.Â  Pressley testified no payments were\r\n  made to RPI at the closing on this property because â€œthere were none due.â€Â  \r\nWhen asked where in the agreement between the parties it provided\r\n  RPI was supposed to negotiate land options with the property owners, Pressley\r\n  stated RPI was a brokerage company, and it was inherent in the term â€œrepresentâ€\r\n  and under the paragraph entitled â€œSite Acquisition.â€Â Â  Pressley further\r\n  admitted he struck through many of the services offered by RPI, including those\r\n  relating to additional tenant lease, Publix lease, and joint venture\r\n  arrangement, and that he changed the compensation under site acquisition to the\r\n  $3 per square foot of Publix gross leasable area to be paid by the seller\r\n  and/or buyer at closing.Â  When questioned on whether there was a specific list\r\n  of tasks RPI was required to perform in order to earn a commission, Pressley\r\n  again stated that it was â€œinherent in that document.â€Â  Pressley admitted,\r\n  however, that RPI had no authority to bind Horne in contracts.Â  \r\nPrior to submission of the case to the jury, counsel for Horne\r\n  submitted four requests to charge in the area of commissions, arguing the\r\n  contract in question was in the nature of a brokerage fee agreement.Â  Counsel\r\n  stated, â€œ[a]lthough there is a flat fee suggested,â€ that flat fee depended on\r\n  whether there was a land contract commission.Â Â  Specifically, Horne sought the\r\n  following instructions be given to the jury:\r\n\r\n\t1.Â  A broker is entitled to his commissions, if during the\r\n  continuance of his agency, he is the efficient or procuring cause of the sale.\r\n\t2.Â  A broker will be regarded as the procuring cause if his\r\n  intervention is the foundation upon which the negotiations resulting in the\r\n  sale is begun.\r\n\t3.Â  It is the emphatic rule in this state that the broker must not\r\n  only show that his efforts were the procuring cause of the sale but must\r\n  further show that his intervention was during the continuance of an agency to\r\n  sell or to find a purchaser.\r\n\t4.Â  A broker is never entitled to a commission for unsuccessful\r\n  efforts.Â  The risk of failure is wholly his.Â  The reward comes only with his\r\n  success.Â  The broker may devote his time and labor, and expend his money with\r\n  ever so much devotion to the interests of his employer, and yet if he fails, if\r\n  without effecting an agreement or accomplishing a bargain, he abandons the\r\n  effort, or his authority is fairly and in good faith terminated, he gains no\r\n  right to commission.\r\n\r\nThe trial court declined to instruct the jury on these four\r\n  charges finding, â€œwhether you call it a commission, whether you call it a fee .\r\n  . . the bottom line is. . . whether or not [RPI] did what [it] was supposed to\r\n  do under the terms of the contract,â€ it was a contract for services and not\r\n  land acquisition, and it was not a procuring cause issue and thus it was\r\n  unnecessary to bring in â€œprocuring cause or anything along those lines.â€Â  Â The\r\n  jury returned a verdict for RPI in the amount of $132,813, and Horne moved for\r\n  a new trial based on the courtâ€™s failure to give the requested instructions.Â Â Â \r\n  The trial court denied the motion, and this appeal followed.\r\nISSUES\r\n1.Â \r\n  Did the trial court err in concluding the fee schedule between the parties was\r\n  a contract for services for a flat fee because the fee schedule clearly called\r\n  for payment of a commission if earned?\r\n2.Â  Did the trial\r\n  court err in failing to charge the jury the law as to procuring cause because\r\n  the issue in the case was the entitlement of RPI to a commission?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn\r\n  action for breach of contract seeking money damages is an action at law.Â  Eldeco,\r\n    Inc. v. Charleston County Sch. Dist., 372 S.C. 470, 476, 642 S.E.2d 726,\r\n  729 (2007).Â  In an action at law, on appeal of a case tried by a jury, the\r\n  jurisdiction of the appellate court extends merely to the correction of errors\r\n  of law.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 85,\r\n  221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Horne asserts the trial court erred in concluding the fee schedule\r\n  agreement was a contract for services.Â  It argues that RPI is a real estate\r\n  broker that was engaged by Horne to represent it in Horneâ€™s attempt to develop\r\n  Publix grocery stores.Â  Horne points to the fact that RPI often referred to its\r\n  compensation under the agreement as a commission, and argues the $3 per square\r\n  foot of leased space language met the definition of commission and, as such,\r\n  RPI could only earn a commission if it was the procuring cause of the\r\n  transaction.Â  Accordingly, Horne contends the trial court erred in failing to\r\n  charge the jury on the law that in order to earn a commission, one must be the\r\n  efficient or procuring cause of the transaction.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  trial judge is required to charge only the current and correct law of South\r\n  Carolina, and the law to be charged to the jury is determined by the evidence adduced\r\n  at trial. Â Â State v. Taylor, 356 S.C. 227, 231, 589 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2003).Â \r\n  To warrant reversal for refusal to give a requested instruction, the refusal\r\n  must have not only been erroneous, but also prejudicial.Â Â Â  McCourt ex rel. McCourt\r\n    v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. 301, 306, 457 S.E.2d 603, 606 (1995).Â  Refusal to\r\n  give a properly requested charge is not error if the general instructions are\r\n  sufficiently broad to enable the jury to understand the law and the issues\r\n  involved.Â  Id.Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  arguing its position, Horne relies heavily on the case of Webb v. First Fed.\r\n    Sav. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n, 300 S.C. 507, 388 S.E.2d 823, overruled in part on other grounds by Myrtle Beach Hosp., Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach,\r\n  341 S.C. 1, 532 S.E.2d at 868 (2000).Â  There, Webb, a real estate broker,\r\n  attempted to broker a real estate deal for First Federal to sell certain\r\n  property to Burger King for $155,000, and an agreement was reached with First\r\n  Federal that Webb would receive a $15,000 commission.Â  The offer was made to\r\n  Burger King, but Burger King declined.Â  Id. at 509, 388 S.E.2d at 824.Â \r\n  Sometime thereafter, Burger King asked Webb to contact First Federal about the\r\n  lot, and when Webb did, he was told it was not available.Â  Approximately six\r\n  months later, Burger King again asked Webb to approach First Federal about the\r\n  availability of the lot.Â  First Federal indicated it had decided to do nothing\r\n  with the property.Â  However, two months later, First Federal began negotiating\r\n  with a franchisee of Burger King.Â  Three months after that, a subsidiary of\r\n  First Federal leased the property to the franchisee, and a Burger King was\r\n  subsequently erected there.Â  Id. at 509, 388 S.E.2d at 825.Â  When Webb\r\n  noticed construction of the restaurant, he brought an action against First\r\n  Federal alleging he was entitled to compensation based upon quantum meruit and\r\n  implied contract.Â  Id. at 508, 509, 388 S.E.2d at 824, 825.Â  Reciting\r\n  the same law Horne sought to be instructed to the jury in requests number three\r\n  and four regarding entitlement to commissions and procuring cause, this court\r\n  noted the unappealed ruling in the matter that the actual contract between Webb\r\n  and First Federal had ended when Burger King refused the initial offer, and\r\n  determined the facts of the case did not support a contract implied in law.Â  Id. at 512-13, 388 S.E.2d at 826.\r\nWe\r\n  find the Webb case to be clearly distinguishable.Â  In the case at hand,\r\n  RPI sought recovery for breach of the partiesâ€™ written contract, not under the\r\n  theory of an implied contract.Â  Further, the evidence adduced at trial shows\r\n  RPI was not acting simply as a real estate broker attempting to secure a deal\r\n  between parties for the sale of land.Â  Rather, as testified to by Metzler, RPI acted as a tenant\r\n  representative, whose role is different from a broker who represents the buyer\r\n  or the seller in a transaction.Â  Metzler testified RPIâ€™s task with regard to its site selection\r\n  duties for Horne was to identify submarkets, further identify intersections,\r\n  help in a site selection process and, once everyone was in agreement on the\r\n  site selection for a possible Publix, to go find the next site.Â  According to\r\n  Metzler, RPI fulfilled these duties with respect to the Broad River and\r\n  Kennerly location, and was instructed by Horne to move onto the next site.Â \r\n  Although Pressley disagreed that RPI fulfilled its duties as to this site,\r\n  Horne presented no evidence that RPI was not engaged to perform those tasks to\r\n  which Metzler testified, and whether Metzler fulfilled those duties under the\r\n  contract was a question for the jury.Â  Under the agreement between the parties,\r\n  Horne Properties agreed to compensate RPI for performing site acquisition on\r\n  each property purchased, the fee being determined based on the square footage\r\n  of the Publix thereafter erected.Â  While it is obvious the fee due could not be\r\n  computed unless and until a Publix was actually erected on the location in\r\n  question, neither this fact, nor the fact that the parties may have referred to\r\n  the expected compensation as a commission establishes that RPI was acting\r\n  merely as a broker, nor was there any evidence of record that RPI acted merely\r\n  as a broker.Â  Further, the trial court instructed the jury on basic contract\r\n  law, including that in order for the contract to be binding and enforceable,\r\n  the parties must have intended to enter a contract and, through their\r\n  negotiations, they must have reached a mutual understanding of the terms of the\r\n  contract.Â  \r\nWe agree with the trial court that the evidence submitted at trial\r\n  shows the contract between the parties was not simply one for land acquisition\r\n  entitling RPI to only a brokerage fee, but was a contract for services, with a\r\n  flat fee to be determined upon the successful completion of a Publix on the\r\n  site upon which RPI performed those services.Â  Accordingly, we hold the trial\r\n  court properly declined to charge the\r\n  jury on the law relating to commissions and procuring cause as requested by\r\n  Horne.Â  See Miller v. Schmid Labs., Inc., 307 S.C. 140, 142-43,\r\n  414 S.E.2d 126, 127 (1992) (noting instruction by the trial court of irrelevant\r\n  and inapplicable principles of law was clearly erroneous and may have served to\r\n  confuse the jury, and holding it is reversible error to charge a correct\r\n  principle of law as governing a case when such principle is inapplicable to the\r\n  issues on trial).Â  See also Cole v. Raut, 378 S.C. 398,\r\n  404, 663 S.E.2d 30, 33 (2008) (noting a jury charge consisting of irrelevant\r\n  and inapplicable principles may confuse the jury and will constitute reversible\r\n  error if the juryâ€™s confusion affects the outcome of the trial).Â  Further, assuming, as Horne contends, there is\r\n  evidence that work performed by RPI fell within the definition of a real estate\r\n  broker, the issue of the partiesâ€™ obligations under the contract was a question\r\n  for the jury.Â  Thus, we find the general\r\n  instructions given by the trial court were sufficiently broad to enable the\r\n  jury to understand the law and the issues involved such that failure to give\r\n  the requested charges was not error. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, the judgment below is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHUFF,\r\n  THOMAS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
