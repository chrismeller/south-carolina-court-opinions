Hayes, III, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-323\r\nHeard August 23, 2006 â€“ Filed September 6, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Theo W. Mitchell, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n        Andrew F. Lindemann and Robert D. Garfield, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Appellant alleges he was injured in a traffic accident, and rather than being taken to a hospital, he was arrested by a Union County sheriffâ€™s deputy and incarcerated at the Union County Detention Center.Â  Appellant brought suit against Union County alleging various tort claims. The circuit court granted Union Countyâ€™s motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, on the basis that the Union County sheriff and his deputies are not employees of Union County and that the detention center was under the control of the sheriff, not Union County. Appellant appeals from the dismissal of his complaint.Â  We affirm.\r\n1.Â  The law is clear that sheriffs and deputy sheriffs are not employees of their respective counties. Sheriffs are â€œconstitutional officer[s] in South Carolina.â€Â  Henry v. Horry County, 334 S.C. 461, 463, 514 S.E.2d 122, 123 (1999).Â  The state, rather than the respective counties, has â€œthe potential power of controlâ€ over sheriffs. Cone v. Nettles, 308 S.C. 109, 112, 417 S.E.2d 523, 525 (1992) (citing Gulledge v. Smart, 691 F. Supp. 947, 954 (D.S.C. 1988)). The sheriff of each county is an elected office established by our state constitution.Â  S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 24; see also Wyatt v. Fowler, 326 S.C. 97, 101-102, 484 S.E.2d 590, 593&nbsp;(1997) (noting â€œdeputies and sheriffs are state officialsâ€ in the context of a 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983 action). The supreme court has long held that deputy sheriffs are not employees of the county. Heath v. County of Aiken, 295 S.C. 416, 419, 368 S.E. 2d 904, 906 (1988) (regarding county governments under section 4-9-30 of the South Carolina Code: â€œlegislature did not intend the term â€˜employeesâ€™ to include deputies.â€)Â  Thus, the Union County sheriff and his deputies are not employees of Union County. \r\n2. Appellant conceded before the circuit court that his first two causes of action â€œcould possibly be dismissed.â€ Appellant pursued his final two claims for gross negligence against Union County.Â  These claims relate to Union Countyâ€™s purported management and operation of the county detention center.Â  The detention center is under the custody of the sheriff, and the sheriff is liable for the safety of individuals confined there. â€œThe sheriff shall in all cases be answerable for neglect of duty or misconduct in office of any deputy.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-13-10 (Supp. 2005).Â  According to section 24-5-10 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005):\r\n\r\n  The sheriff shall have custody of the jail in his county and, if he appoint a jailer to keep it, the sheriff shall be liable for such jailer and the sheriff or jailer shall receive and safely keep in prison any person delivered or committed to either of them, according to law. \r\n\r\nA â€œdetention centerâ€ is a â€œjailâ€ within the meaning of this statute. Roton v. Sparks, 270 S.C. 637, 639, 244 S.E.2d 214, 216&nbsp;(1978).Â  There is nothing in the complaint (or anywhere in the record) to indicate that Union County is somehow responsible for the operation of the detention center. Accordingly, the order of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-324","title":"Pastene v.

Dean, of Beaufort, for Respondents Beaufort County School District, Herman Gaither, Calvin White, Otis Smith, Carl Simmons, Mark Seigle, Herbert Glaze, Richard McClure, and William Evans.\r\nMary Bass Lohr, of Beaufort, for Respondents Beaufort Police Department and Police Officer Angela Hayes.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Alexander Pastene (Pastene) appeals the master-in-equityâ€™s grant of summary judgment.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nPastene began work as a substitute teacher with the Beaufort County School System in 1992. Â In 1995, an alleged incident involving attendance records and the supervision of students resulted in his removal from Hilton Head High Schoolâ€™s roll of substitute teachers.Â  Pastene continued to serve as a substitute teacher at other schools within the district and was without reproach until May of 1999, when school officials cautioned him for purportedly engaging in an improper discussion about sex with elementary schoolchildren.\r\nOn November 19, 1999, Pastene was employed as a substitute teacher at Beaufort High School, when two female students accused him of making inappropriate comments in response to their requests to use the restroom. Â The school district held an administrative hearing on November 29, 1999 to investigate the incident.Â  Pastene, the two girls, the girlsâ€™ parents, and several of the defendants were among those present.Â  While precisely what was said and transpired during the course of this proceeding is in dispute, it is clear that many negative things about Pastene were stated and alleged and that one of the parents made a comment or threat in regards to killing Pastene. Â Whether this comment was meant to be taken literally is not certain.Â  \r\nAs a result of the proceeding, Pastene was removed from Beaufort County School Districtâ€™s list of substitute teachers.Â  A letter dated December 3, 1999 notified him of this action.Â  Later in the month, correspondence from the districtâ€™s personnel director advised Pastene that he could respond in writing to the alleged incidents and that meeting with the director could be arranged.Â  Thereafter, Pastene made requests to the school district for a copy of his personnel file and to the police for copy of the incident report.Â  He did not, however, make a written response concerning his dismissal or schedule a meeting with the personnel director.\r\nOn July 17, 2003, Pastene filed the instant action for intentional infliction of emotional distress and gross negligence.Â  Although the complaint makes many allegations of conspiracy, the claims arise out of and center around actions taken by the school officials, specifically those stemming from the November 29, 1999 administrative hearing.\r\nIn addition to their answers, the defendants all filed motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment.Â  After a series of various other motions and memorandum in support of motions, a hearing was held on December 16, 2003 in front of the Honorable Curtis L. Coltrane, Master-in-Equity and Special Circuit Court Judge.Â  Just before the beginning of the hearing, the school district defendants provided the court, the police defendants, and Pastene with an additional memorandum in support of their motion for summary judgment.Â  During the hearing, Pastene offered to provide an audiotape of the November 29, 1999 school proceeding, which the master declined.Â  \r\nIn the two days immediately following the hearing, Pastene drafted a response to the school district defendantsâ€™ most recently submitted memorandum.Â  The master-in-equity refused to accept this document from Pastene.Â  Although Pastene was unaware at the time, the master had already drafted the order for the case earlier in the day.\r\nThe master-in-equity, by a written order dated December 18, 2003, granted the defendantsâ€™ motions on the grounds that (1) Pastene failed to commence the action with the applicable statute of limitations and, (2) with respect to the individual defendants, that the claims against them were barred by section 15-78-70(a) of the South Carolina Code (2003).Â  Pastene made no post trial motions. \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nOn appeal, Pastene argues that the master-in-equity erred in failing to toll the statute of limitations.Â  He concedes that the South Carolina Tort Claims Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-10, et seq. (2003), governs the underlying action, which provides an applicable statute of limitations of two years.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§15-78-110 (2003).Â  Although Pasteneâ€™s complaint involves a host of different incidents, the lattermost event would be his December 1999 receipt of the letter notifying him of his removal from the roll of substitute teachers.Â  The instant action was not filed until July 17, 2003, over eighteen months past the appropriate time period.Â  Pastene contends, however, that his complaint should be allowed because the defendants â€œdominatedâ€ him until â€œsometime between the end of 2001 and 2002.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nTypically, a statute of limitations begins to run on the date the plaintiff knows or should know through the exercise of reasonable diligence, the existence of the facts giving rise to the cause of action.Â  Wiggins v. Edwards, 314 S.C. 123, 442 S.E.2d 169 (1994).Â  Under the common law of South Carolina, â€œa defendant may be estopped from claiming the statute of limitations as a defense if â€˜the delay that otherwise would give operation to the statute had been induced by the defendantâ€™s conduct.â€™ â€Â  Black v. Lexington School District, 327 S.C. 55, 61, 488 S.E.2d 327, 330 (1993) (citations omitted).Â  â€œAlthough the issue whether a defendant is estopped from claiming the statute of limitations is ordinarily a question of fact, summary judgment is appropriate where there is no evidence of conduct on the defendantâ€™s part warranting estoppel.â€Â  Id.Â  Pastene merely states that the defendants â€œdominatedâ€ him and â€œpreventedâ€ him for bringing suit and has provided no evidence of any such conduct.Â  The only indication of any duress came not from the defendants but from the comments made by one the parents during the November 29, 1999 proceeding.Â  Additionally, subsequent to this comment, which he alleges to have been a â€œdeath threat,â€ Pastene continued correspondence and contact with many of the defendants, actions contrary to his assertion that the was dominated, frightened, and/or placed under duress. Â No evidence was presented as to warrant estoppel as alleged by Pastene, and accordingly, summary judgment was appropriate.\r\nPastene contends that the master-in-equity erred in dismissing the claims against the individual defendants pursuant to the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.Â  Section 15-78-70 of the South Carolina Code provides in pertinent part:Â  \r\n\r\nAn employee of a governmental entity who commits a tort while acting within the scope of his official duty is not liable therefor â€¦ [unless] it was proved that the employeeâ€™s conduct was not within the scope of his official duties or that it constituted actual fraud, actual malice, intent to harm, or a crime involving moral turpitude. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-70 (2003); See also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-200 (2003) (providing that the South Carolina Tort Claims Act is the exclusive and sole remedy for any tort committed by an employee of a governmental entity while acting within the scope of the employeeâ€™s official duty).Â  \r\nPasteneâ€™s complaint states that all the alleged acts of the individual defendants were committed during the course and scope of their official duties. Â He presented no evidence to indicate they acted with the requisite malice, purpose, or intent so as to remove them from the immunity provided by the statue.Â  Consequently, summary judgment for the individual respondents was appropriate, in addition to and irrespective of, the dismissal for violation of the statute of limitations.\r\nAdditionally, Pastene alleges the master-in-equity abused his discretion in failing to consider the unedited audiotape of the schoolâ€™s December 1999 proceeding. Â We refuse to consider this issue, as it is not properly preserved for review.Â  \r\nAlthough Pastene may have requested at the hearing that the master take the tape into consideration, the December 18, 2003 order included no ruling on this issue.Â  An issue can not be raised on appeal when the appellate does not move to amend the lower courtâ€™s order for failure to consider the issue.Â  See Bailey v. Covil Corp., 291 S.C. 417 354 S.E.2d 35 (1987).Â  â€œWhere an issue presented to the court is not ruled on in the final order, the issue must be raised by an appropriate post-trial motion to be preserved for appeal.â€Â  Harris v. Bennett, 332 S.C. 238, 245, 503 S.E.2d 782, 786 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Pastene failed to make a motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuit to Rule 59(e) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, and thus the issue is not preserved for review in the case sub judice.\r\nFinally, Pastene claims the master abused his discretion in refusing to consider his memorandum in response to district defendantâ€™s memorandum and that that the master was unduly influenced by the counsel for the defendants.Â  These two issues are also not preserved for review and therefore will not be considered by this court.\r\nâ€œAs a general rule, an issue may not be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the court below to be preserved for appellate review.â€ Â Harris, 332 S.C. at 245, 503 S.E.2d at 786 (citing Brashier v. South Carolina Depâ€™t. of Transp., 327 S.C. 179, 490 S.E.2d 8 (1997)). \r\n\r\nIt is a fundamental rule of law that an appellate court will affirm a ruling by a lower court if the offended party does not challenge that ruling. Â Failure to challenge the ruling is an abandonment of the issue and precludes consideration on appeal. The unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case and requires affirmance.\r\n\r\nFirst Union Nat. Bank of South Carolina v. Soden, 333 S.C. 554, 566, 511 S.E.2d 372, 378 (Ct. App. 1998) (citations omitted).Â  Although Pastene may not have suspected or been made aware of these two issues until the hearing on December 16, 2003 or, at the latest, upon his receipt of masterâ€™s order on or about December 23, 2003, he had methods of relief available and avenues with which to properly preserve the issues.Â  He chose not to make a Rule 59, Rule 60, or any other post trial motions.Â  As a result, these two issues were never properly considered by the master-in-equity and will not be considered by the appellate court in rendering its decision.\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nAccordingly, the order granting summary judgment is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, KITTREDGE, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-325","title":"SCDSS v.

Scott Bellamy and George M. Hearn, Jr., both of Conway, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, Office of the Attorney General, all of Columbia; and Solicitor John Gregory Hembree,Â  of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Ernest Lee was convicted and sentenced for the offenses of criminal sexual conduct (CSC) in the second degree and impersonating a police officer.Â  Lee was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment for CSC and one year imprisonment, consecutive, for impersonating a police officer.Â  Lee appeals his convictions.Â  We affirm. \r\n1.Â  Lee argues the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the charges against him because the State destroyed the victimâ€™s blood before Lee could test it for drugs.Â  The State does not have an absolute duty to preserve evidence.Â  State v. Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. 526, 538, 552 S.E.2d 300, 307 (2001).Â  To establish a due process violation where the State fails to preserve evidence, a defendant must demonstrate either (1) the State destroyed the evidence in bad faith, or (2) the evidence possessed an exculpatory value apparent before the State destroyed the evidence and the defendant cannot obtain evidence of comparable value by other means.Â  State v. Singleton, 319 S.C. 312, 317, 460 S.E.2d 573, 576 (1995); State v. Mabe, 306 S.C. 355, 359, 412 S.E.2d 386, 388 (1991); State v. Jackson, 302 S.C. 313, 315, 396 S.E.2d 101, 102 (1990); State v. Hutton, 358 S.C. 622, 631, 595 S.E.2d 876, 881 (Ct. App. 2004); see also Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51, 58 (1988) (holding that â€œunless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of lawâ€).Â  Here, the record is devoid not only of any evidence the State destroyed victimâ€™s blood in bad faith, but also of any evidence that the blood sample possessed an exculpatory value.Â  Accordingly, Lee fails to establish a due process violation.Â  Additionally, Lee was not prejudiced by his inability to test the victimâ€™s blood for drugs.Â  See State v. Douglas, 367 S.C. 498, 524, 626 S.E.2d 59, 73 (Ct. App. 2006) (â€œError without prejudice does not warrant reversal.â€).Â  First, Lee had the benefit of eliciting testimony from a law enforcement officer that the State destroyed the victimâ€™s blood before Lee could test it for drugs.Â  Second, Lee elicited expert testimony that showed the victimâ€™s blood alcohol level at the time of the incident was about .165 percent.Â  Therefore, Lee fully informed the jury of the fact that the State destroyed the victimâ€™s blood before he could test it for drugs and that the victim was impaired at the time of the incident.Â  We find no error (and certainly no reversible error) in the trial courtâ€™s denial of Leeâ€™s motion to dismiss. \r\n2.Â  Lee argues the trial court erred in charging the jury a second time on CSC in the first, second, and third degrees when the jury only asked for an explanation of CSC in the second and third degrees.Â  Lee claims State v. Anderson, 322 S.C. 89, 470 S.E.2d 103 (1996), prevents the trial court from recharging the jury on matters not expressly encompassed in the juryâ€™s request.Â  Anderson, however, does not limit the trial court from recharging the jury beyond the scope of the juryâ€™s request.Â  Anderson merely holds that â€œwhen a jury requests an additional charge, it is sufficient for the [trial] court to charge only those matters necessary to answer the juryâ€™s request.â€Â  Anderson, 322 S.C. at 94, 470 S.E.2d at 106 (citing State v. Barksdale, 311 S.C. 210, 216, 428 S.E.2d 498, 502 (Ct. App. 1993)).Â  The scope of the rechargeâ€”determining what is necessary to answer the juryâ€™s requestâ€”is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Here, the trial court reasoned the jury should receive the full charge on the greater and lesser included offenses of CSC so the jury would have the lesser included offenses of CSC in the second and third degrees in context.Â  We find no abuse of discretion.Â  Moreover, in light of Leeâ€™s conviction for CSC in the second degree, Lee is unable to establish prejudice.Â  \r\n3.Â  Lee argues the trial court erred in submitting the written charge on CSC in the first, second, and third degrees to the jury.Â  Lee failed to preserve the issue.Â  To preserve an issue for appellate review the issue must have been â€œ(1) raised to and ruled upon by the trial court, (2) raised by the appellant, (3) raised in a timely manner, and (4) raised to the trial court with sufficient specificity.â€Â  State v. Rogers, 361 S.C. 178, 183, 603 S.E.2d 910, 912-13 (Ct. App. 2004) (citations omitted).Â  On appeal, Lee argues the trial court erred because the usual practice in South Carolina is for the trial court to issue the charge orally only.Â  At trial, however, Lee did not object to the trial courtâ€™s intention to send its written instructions on CSC second and third degrees to the jury room.Â  Instead, Lee objected only to the trial courtâ€™s decision to send its charge on CSC in the first degree to the jury room.Â  Essentially, Lee reasserted his argument that the trial court should not recharge (or submit in writing to) the jury the law on CSC in the first degree because the jury did not ask for it.Â  Lee did not raise to the trial court the issue of whether written instructions should be sent back to the jury room at all with sufficient specificity to preserve it for appellate review.Â  In any event, we find no error.Â  There was no objection to the submission of written instructions to the jury concerning CSC in the second and third degrees. And, as noted above, the court acted within its discretion in submitting the instruction on CSC first degree so the jury could understand in context the lesser included offenses of CSC in the second and third degrees.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, KITTREDGE AND SHORT, JJ., CONCUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-327","title":"Berkheimer v.

Casey Manning, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-327\r\nSubmitted September 1, 2006 â€“ Filed September 18, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        S. Jahue Moore and Christian G. Spradley, both of West Columbia, for Appellants.\r\n        Vance J. Bettis and Shahin Vafai, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Appellants are retired Richland County employees rehired by Richland County in accordance with the so-called TERI Plan.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 9-11-90(4)(a) (Supp. 2005).Â  Under this section, Appellants may receive retirement benefits while they continue working and receiving a salary.Â  In calculating Appellantsâ€™ annual leave and longevity pay upon rehire, Richland County considered Appellantsâ€™ start date as the date it rehired Appellants rather than the date it originally hired them many years earlier.Â  Appellants brought a declaratory judgment action.Â  They argued the Richland County Code of Ordinances (County Code) required Richland County to calculate their start date as the date it originally hired them. Â Both parties moved for summary judgment.Â  The circuit court granted Richland County summary judgment.Â  We affirm.[1] \r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard that governs the circuit court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Pittman v. Grand Strand Entmâ€™t, 363 S.C. 531, 536, 611 S.E.2d 922, 925 (2005).Â  Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Id.Â  On appeal, all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id.Â  â€œStatutory interpretation is a question of law.â€Â  S.C. Uninsured Employerâ€™s Fund v. House, 360 S.C. 468, 470, 602 S.E.2d 81, 82 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\n1.Â  Appellants argue the circuit court erred in concluding the County Code did not require Richland County to calculate Appellantsâ€™ annual leave and longevity pay from the date it originally hired Appellants.Â  The circuit court held Appellants retired from Richland County, rather than resigned, and that because â€œretireâ€ and â€œresignâ€ are mutually exclusive terms, Appellants could not avail themselves of an exception in the County Code that allowed employees who resigned in good standing to calculate their annual leave and longevity pay from the date Richland County originally hired them.Â  â€œAn ordinance must receive a practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of the lawmakers.â€Â  Rest. Row Assocs. v. Horry County, 327 S.C. 383, 391, 489 S.E.2d 641, 645 (Ct. App. 1997), affâ€™d as modified, 335 S.C. 209, 516 S.E.2d 442 (1999).Â  While we agree with Appellants that â€œresignâ€ and â€œretireâ€ are not necessarily mutually exclusive terms, they are treated as such within the context of the County Code, which clearly differentiates between an employee who has resigned and one who has retired.Â  Compare Richland County, S.C., Code Â§ 2-403 (â€œResignationsâ€) with Richland County, S.C., Code Â§ 2-438 (â€œRetirementâ€).Â  Because Appellants stipulated they retired, Richland County correctly calculated their start date as the date it rehired them.Â  Insofar as the County Code differentiates between the terms resignation and retirement, we concur in the reasoning and judgment of the circuit court. \r\n2.Â  Appellants next argue the circuit court erred in concluding the County Code did not require Richland County to contribute to the cost of Appellantsâ€™ dependentsâ€™ health insurance.Â  Appellants assert that because they are â€œregular employeesâ€ under the County Code, Richland County should cover a portion of their dependentsâ€™ health insurance.Â  â€œThe general rule of statutory construction is that a specific statute prevails over a more general one.â€Â  Atlas Food Sys. and Servs., Inc. v. Crane Natâ€™l Vendors Div. of Unidynamics Corp., 319 S.C. 556, 558, 462 S.E.2d 858, 859 (1995).Â  The specific County Code provision concerning health insurance, which requires that retired employees cover all of their dependentsâ€™ health insurance, trumps the general County Code provision defining a â€œregular employee.â€Â  As determined by the circuit court, Richland County is not required to cover any portion of Appellantsâ€™ dependentsâ€™ health insurance.Â  We find no error. \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, KITTREDGE, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-328","title":"State v.

Thomas, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Julie Hiott appeals the trial courtâ€™s directed verdict in favor of Washington Mutual Bank (Bank).Â  Hiott contends the trial court erred in excluding the testimony of her expert witness and in directing verdicts against her claims for unfair trade practices, violation of the attorney preference statute, breach of a forbearance agreement, and the unconscionability of her loan agreement.Â  We affirm.[1] \r\nFACTS\r\nIn October of 2000, Julie Hiott[2] contacted Affordable Homes, Inc. (Dealer) seeking to purchase a mobile home.Â  Hiottâ€™s fiancÃ©, Dennis Stroble, had informed Hiott that his brother, Donnie Stroble, worked for Dealer and could sell her a repossessed double-wide mobile home at a reduced cost. Â Upon arriving at Dealerâ€™s North Charleston location, a Dealer employee, Raymond Barrineau, informed Hiott that the repossessed double-wide home had been damaged during relocation.Â  Barrineau told Hiott he would sell her a new double-wide home at his cost because Donnie Stroble worked for Dealer.Â Â Â  \r\nIn December of 2000, Hiott selected the mobile home she wished to purchase.Â  Barrineau contacted a mortgage broker, Mortgage Assurance (Broker), to secure a loan for Hiott.Â  Hiott and Barrineau completed a mortgage application and sent it to Broker.Â  Broker arranged a loan for Hiott through North American Mortgage Company which later became a division of Bank.[3]Â  Hiott received a loan and mortgage for one-hundred six thousand dollars secured by her mobile home and the land on which it was placed.Â  \r\nIn February of 2002, Bank informed Hiott that her loan was in default and allowed her thirty-five days from this notice to repay the default amount.Â  In June of 2002, Bank offered Hiott a forbearance agreement which she verbally agreed to accept.Â  A written forbearance agreement offer was sent to Hiott, but she never signed or returned this offer and failed to comply with the specified terms.Â  \r\nBank initiated a complaint seeking foreclosure and Hiott answered and counterclaimed for unfair trade practices, violation of the attorney preference statute, breach of a forbearance agreement, and the unconscionability of her loan agreement.Â  The trial court directed a verdict against each of Hiottâ€™s claims and referred Bankâ€™s foreclosure action to a special referee.Â  Hiott now appeals. Â Â Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn ruling on a motion for directed verdict, a court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€Â  Swinton Creek Nursery v. Edisto Farm Credit, ACA, 334 S.C. 469, 476, 514 S.E.2d 126, 130 (1999).Â  A directed verdict is properly granted when the evidence yields only one inference.Â  Id.Â  â€œIn essence, we must determine whether a verdict for a party opposing the motion would be reasonably possible under the facts as liberally construed in his favor.â€Â  Harvey v. Strickland, 350 S.C. 303, 309, 566 S.E.2d 529, 532 (2002).Â  This court will reverse only when there is no evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  Swinton Creek Nursery, 334 S.C. at 477, 514 S.E.2d at 130.Â  Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act (SCUTPA)\r\nHiott contends the trial court erred in directing a verdict against her SCUTPA claim.Â  Hiott argues Bank violated the SCUTPA by failing to fully investigate her financial qualifications and furnishing her with a mortgage she could not pay.Â  We disagree.\r\nSCUPTA states â€œunfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-20 (Supp. 2005).Â  â€œAn act is â€˜unfairâ€™ when it is offensive to public policy or when it is immoral, unethical, or oppressive; a practice is â€˜deceptiveâ€™ when it has a tendency to deceive.â€Â  Johnson v. Collins Entmâ€™t Co., Inc., 349 S.C. 613, 636, 564 S.E.2d 653, 665 (2002).Â  \r\nHiott contends Bank should have known her monthly payments were virtually identical to her monthly income, and she could not afford the loan.Â  However, Bank was provided with a residential loan application and several documents concerning Hiottâ€™s financial qualifications which led it to make the loan.Â  Hiott testified some of these documents contained her valid signature, but on others her signature was forged.Â  Regardless of the accuracy or truthfulness of the documentation, the following information was provided to Bank:Â  1)Â  W-2 tax forms indicating Hiott worked for Daigle Construction and earned $33,619 and $36,188 in 1999 and 2000, respectively,[4]Â  2)Â  a gift certification stating Hiottâ€™s brother-in-law Dennis Stroble gifted her $6,000,[5] Â andÂ  3)Â  a bill of sale indicating Hiott had sold, through a trade-in, a mobile home to Dealer for $14,000.[6]Â  Hiott contends Bank should have known the above documentation was false and should not have granted her the loan.\r\nAlthough Bank was provided with W-2 tax forms indicating Hiott was employed by Daigle Construction, her credit reports did not reflect any record of this employment.Â  Despite Hiottâ€™s assertions to the contrary, Bank, when faced with this conflicting information regarding Hiottâ€™s employment, did investigate the validity of the above documentation.Â  On May 16, 2001, Bank contacted Daigle Construction and was informed by Dennis Daigle, owner of Daigle Construction, that Hiott was currently employed by the company and had been employed for the previous nine years.[7]Â  While there is evidence tending to support the idea that Bankâ€™s underwriters could have been more diligent in gaining supporting documentation to follow-up on Hiottâ€™s loan application, the record is completely devoid of any evidence to support the assertion the Bank knew the information to be false.Â  A poor business decision does not necessarily constitute an unfair trade practice.Â Â  Â \r\n\r\n  There is no support in South Carolina law for the proposition that a service person violates the unfair trade practice statute if he performs his job poorly or overlooks something which should have attracted his attention. An explicit or implicit representation that he performed his job properly, if the fault is negligence or inattention, is simply not the kind of deceptive practice the statute was intended to reach. \r\n\r\nClarkson v. Orkin Exterminating Co., Inc., 761 F.2d 189, 191 (C.A.4 (S.C.) 1985).Â  Bankâ€™s actions in granting Hiott a loan were based on the false loan application and documentation that it received.Â  Regardless of who was responsible for producing and providing Bank with this false information, there is no evidence Bank knew the information to be false.Â  Even if we were to accept as fact that Bankâ€™s underwriters were negligent and caused Bank to make a bad loan, there is no evidence of any unfair or deceptive acts made by Bank.Â  Thus, we find the trial court properly granted Bankâ€™s directed verdict motion.Â  \r\nII.Â  Exclusion of Expert Testimony\r\nHiott contends the trial court erred in excluding her expert witnessâ€™s testimony.Â  Hiott argues her expert would have assisted the jury in understanding complicated banking and underwriting procedures.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nRule 702, SCRE, governs the admission of expert testimony and states:Â  â€œIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.â€Â  The trial court has wide discretion in determining the qualification of expert witnesses and the admissibility of their testimony, and its decision to admit or exclude such testimony will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of that discretion.Â  Mizell v. Glover, 351 S.C. 392, 406, 570 S.E.2d 176, 183 (2002).Â  â€œA trial courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of an expertâ€™s testimony constitutes an abuse of discretion when the ruling is manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable, or unfair.â€Â  Fields v. Regâ€™l Med Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 26, Â 609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005).Â  \r\nAlthough prevented from testifying in front of the jury, Hiottâ€™s expert, a loan originator, was proffered.Â  Hiottâ€™s expert testified that there were several â€œred flagsâ€ which Bank should have noticed in processing Hiottâ€™s loan.Â  Taken in the light most favorable to Hiott, this testimony established only that Bank may have been negligent in making a â€œbadâ€ loan to Hiott.Â  We agree with the trial courtâ€™s assertion that â€œwhat heâ€™s [expert] testified does not amount to an unfair trade practice.â€Â  This expertâ€™s testimony would not have assisted a jury in determining if an unfair trade practice had been utilized by the bank, thus, we find no error. \r\nIII.Â  Attorney Preference Statute\r\nHiott contends the trial court erred in directing a verdict against her claim pursuant to the attorney preference statute.Â  Hiott testified that Bank violated the statute because she did not know she had a right to select an attorney, and her signature on the attorney preference checklist was a forgery.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe attorney preference statute requires creditors of personal loans secured by real estate to ascertain the borrowerâ€™s preference as to legal counsel prior to closing.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-10-102 (Supp. 2005).Â  The statute further explains that a creditor complies with this requirement as long as it gives the borrower notice of the preference information in a manner specified by the statute, such as including it on or with the credit application.Â  Id.Â  Section 37-10-105 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) denotes a creditorâ€™s liability under the attorney preference statute and states, in pertinent part, as follows:\r\n\r\n  (B)Â  No creditor may be held liable in an action brought under this section for a violation of this chapter if the creditor shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid the error.\r\n\r\nHiott testified she never saw nor signed an attorney preference sheet and was unaware that she had the right to select an attorney.Â  However, Bank was provided with a signed attorney preference sheet stating the borrower had no preference of attorney and asking for assistance from the lender.Â  The attorney preference sheet goes on to state that HiottÂ  selected an attorney from the list of acceptable attorneys.Â  This specified attorney was present at the closing.[8]Â  \r\nRegardless of the authenticity of Hiottâ€™s signature on the attorney preference sheet, there is no evidence in the record to indicate any knowledge of wrongdoing by Bank.Â  Bank was provided with signed documentation which complied with the attorney preference statute.Â  Bank followed proper procedures to avoid this error, thus, we find a directed verdict against this claim was proper. \r\nIV.Â  Forbearance Agreement\r\nHiott contends the trial court erred in directing a verdict against her claim for breach of a forbearance agreement.Â  She claims she honored the agreement, but Bank nonetheless attempted to foreclose on her property.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAn agreement is â€œthe union of two or more mindsâ€ in something done or to be done, a mutual assent to do something.Â  Gaskins v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of S.C., 271 S.C. 101, 105, 245 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1978). Â Â Rules of contract construction exist to determine the partiesâ€™ intention, and the courts, in attempting to ascertain that intention, will seek to determine both the situation of the parties, as well as their goals at the time they entered the contract.Â  Lindsay v. Lindsay, 328 S.C. 329, 337, 491 S.E.2d 583, 587-88 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œ[A]n agreement that omits material terms may be determined to be unenforceable for indefiniteness.â€Â  Id. at 337-38, 491 S.E.2d at 588.\r\nHiott contends she was orally offered a forbearance agreement in a June 24, 2002 telephone call with Bank.Â  She contends she accepted this agreement, and the only terms of this oral agreement were that she pay two thousand dollars to Bank by July 12, 2002, with the remaining amount of arrears to be paid within nine months.Â  Bank asserts this conversation did not complete an agreement.Â  On June 27, 2002, Bank sent Hiott a written forbearance agreement contract which she was to sign and return.Â  This written contract included material terms and required Hiott not only to pay monies as noted above, but also required she provide Bank with evidence of sufficient income.Â  Hiott never signed or returned this contract because, as she testified, she did not have income in the amount required by the contract. Â Â \r\nIn support of her assertion regarding the oral forbearance agreement, Hiott entered into evidence a â€œconsolidated notes logâ€ (log).Â  This log, compiled by Bank, contains notes regarding Hiottâ€™s account and includes notes from telephone conversations.Â  The log referencing June 24, 2002, states â€œPre-approved forbearance.Â  Mortgagor clled [sic] back and it appears that we did find his $1K and have returned it.Â  Has another $1K now I agree to take $2K down by 7-12 then bal over 9.â€Â  Hiott contends the lack of any notes regarding any other terms supports her assertion that there were no additional terms regarding proof of income in the oral forbearance agreement she reached with Bank.Â  Â Â \r\nThe evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Hiott would indicate that she and Bank agreed to form an oral forbearance agreement on June 24, 2002, thereby negating any additional terms required by Bank in its June 27, 2004 written forbearance agreement contract.Â  However, it is patently unreasonable to infer that Bank would accept two thousand dollars in exchange for never foreclosing on Hiottâ€™s property regardless of future events.Â  Further evidence that there was no meeting of the minds on this issue is provided by the written contract Bank sent to Hiott a mere three days after the June 24 telephone conversation.Â  At best, it does not appear Hiott and Bank shared a meeting of the minds regarding the forbearance agreement.\r\nFurther, even were we to assume the June 24, 2002 telephone conversation constituted an oral agreement, this agreement would be unenforceable for indefiniteness.Â  The agreement, as constituted through Hiottâ€™s argument and in the log, lacks material terms such as duration and conditions of Bankâ€™s agreement not to foreclose.Â  Bank reduced to writing these necessary material terms in the written contract it provided to Hiott.Â  Hiott neither signed nor complied with this written contract.Â  Because we find there was no enforceable forbearance agreement between Hiott and Bank, we find no error by the trial court in directing a verdict against Hiottâ€™s claim for breach.Â  \r\nV.Â  Unconscionability\r\nHiott contends the trial court erred in directing a verdict against her claim for unconscionability.Â  Hiott argues the loan she received was unconscionable because the bank failed to fully investigate her financial qualifications and provided her with a loan they knew or should have known she could not pay back.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 37-5-108 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) outlines factors utilized to determine if unconscionable conduct has occurred and the remedies the court may provide.Â  â€œUnconscionability has been recognized as the absence of meaningful choice on the part of one party due to one-sided contract provisions, together with terms that are so oppressive that no reasonable person would make them and no fair and honest person would accept them.â€Â  Carolina Care Plan, Inc. v. United HealthCare Services, Inc.,Â  361 S.C. 544, 554, 606 S.E.2d 752, 757 (2004).Â  \r\nWhile the identity of the person or persons who misled Bank is disputed amongst the parties in this action, it is undisputed that Bank was intentionally misled through the use of fraudulent documentation.Â  Based on this misinformation, Bank supplied Hiott with a loan requiring payments which she could not feasibly afford.Â  There is no evidence of any unconscionable conduct on the part of Bank.Â  We find no error by the trial court in directing a verdict against this claim.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court properly excluded testimony from Hiottâ€™s expert witness and properly directed verdicts against Hiottâ€™s claims for unfair trade practices, violation of the attorney preference statute, breach of a forbearance agreement, and the unconscionability of her loan agreement.Â  Based on the foregoing, the trial courtâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nANDERSON, KITTREDGE, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  In October of 2000, Julie Hiott was engaged to Dennis Stroble, and after the two wed, she became Julie Stroble.Â  For purposes of this matter, she will be referred to as Julie Hiott. \r\n[3] For purposes of this matter, actions taken by North American Mortgage Company will be attributed to Bank.\r\n[4] Hiott testified that Barrineau told her he had â€œmade upâ€ some W-2 forms for her to â€œmake it look good at closing.â€Â  Hiott has never worked for Daigle Construction.Â  She cleans homes for a living and usually earns between twelve and thirteen thousand dollars per year.Â  \r\n[5] Dennis Stroble was actually Hiottâ€™s fiancÃ©, and he did not give Hiott the $6,000.Â  The money was put into Hiottâ€™s account by Dealer with the agreement it would be returned to Dealer after the closing.Â  Hiott tetstified that Barrineau told her â€œthat way [you will] look good on [your] account for the bankâ€™s purposes.â€Â Â Â  \r\n[6] Hiott testified she did not have a trade-in, and did not sell anything to Dealer.Â  \r\n[7] Notably, Daigle Construction performed construction work for Dealer. Dennis Daigle owned Daigle Construction and was married to Dealerâ€™s office manager, Kathy.Â Â  \r\n[8] Hiott testified she had not spoken with this attorney prior to closing, and, although he was present at the closing, he did not represent her.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-330","title":"Tolbert v.

Evans, Jr., Master-in-Equity\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-330\r\nSubmitted September 1, 2006 â€“ Filed September 19, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJohn Derrick Clark, of Sumter; for Appellant.\r\nJohn Evans James, III, of Sumter; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Allen Tolbert appeals the master-in-equityâ€™s order dismissing his cause of action alleging Sheriff Tommy Mims of the Sumter County Sheriffâ€™s Department (Department) discharged him in retaliation for filing a workerâ€™s compensation claim.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Department hired Tolbert as a sheriffâ€™s deputy in January 1992.Â  On April 16, 2002, Tolbert injured his right foot and ankle while performing employment-related physical training.Â  Tolbert was immediately taken to Tuomey Regional Medical Center where he was treated in the emergency room.Â  Shortly thereafter, a workerâ€™s compensation claim was filed on behalf of Tolbert.Â  Tolbert retained an attorney as a result of the claim despite being advised by Sheriff Mims that he did not need an attorney.Â  \r\nTolbert received medical excuses relieving him from his work until June 10, 2002, on which date he was medically released to perform light duty.Â  The Department offered Tolbert light duty on July 30, 2002. Â Tolbertâ€™s treating orthopedist informed the Department that Tolbert was released to return to work full duty on September 23, 2002. Â According to the Department, Tolbert continued to perform light duty work. Â On October 30, 2002, the Department offered Tolbert leave under the Family Medical Leave Act. Â In response, Tolbert informed the Department that he intended to talk with his attorney before making a decision.Â  Sheriff Mims terminated Tolbert on November 12, 2002.Â  According to Sheriff Mims, the decision to terminate Tolbert was based on Tolbertâ€™s work history, prior reprimands, and his failure to return the Family Medical Leave form within a reasonable period of time. \r\nTolbert filed this action against Sheriff Mims individually and in his official capacity with the Department as well as the County of Sumter.[2]Â  In his complaint, Tolbert alleged his termination was in retaliation for filing a workerâ€™s compensation claim. Â Pursuant to an order of reference, the case was referred to the master-in-equity.Â  After a hearing, the master ruled in favor of Sheriff Mims.Â  The master specifically found that Tolbert â€œsuffered no retaliation due to the pursuit of a workersâ€™ compensation claim in relation to his injury.â€Â  In reaching this conclusion, the master held Sheriff Mimsâ€™s decision to terminate Tolbert was justifiable based on the â€œwealth of evidence showing [Tolbertâ€™s] difficulty in relating with the public, his peers and supervisors, in addition to the courtâ€™s view of [Tolbertâ€™s] demeanor while on the stand.â€ Â Thus, the master concluded that Tolbert failed to meet his burden of showing that he would not have been terminated â€œbut forâ€ the filing of the workersâ€™ compensation claim.\r\nTolbert appeals the masterâ€™s decision.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nTolbert argues the master erred in finding that he failed to prove Sheriff Mims terminated him in retaliation for filing a workerâ€™s compensation claim.Â  He contends the preponderance of the evidence establishes that he was terminated from his employment in violation of section 41-1-80 of the South Carolina Code.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œAs an equity action, a retaliatory discharge claim is tried without a jury.â€Â  Johnson v. J.P. Stevens &amp; Co., 308 S.C. 116, 118, 417 S.E.2d 527, 529 (1992).Â  In reviewing a retaliatory discharge claim, this court may find facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Hinton v. Designer Ensembles, Inc., 343 S.C. 236, 242, 540 S.E.2d 94, 96 (2000); Marr v. City of Columbia, 307 S.C. 545, 548, 416 S.E.2d 615, 617 (1992).\r\nTolbertâ€™s claim is governed by section 41-1-80 of the South Carolina Code.Â  This section provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nNo employer may discharge or demote any employee because the employee has instituted or caused to be instituted, in good faith, any proceeding under the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Law (Title 42 of the 1976 Code), or has testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding.\r\nAny employer who violates any provision of this section is liable in a civil action for lost wages suffered by an employee as a result of the violation, and an employee discharged or demoted in violation of this section is entitled to be reinstated to his former position.Â  The burden of proof is upon the employee.\r\nAny employer shall have as an affirmative defense to this section the following:Â  wilful or habitual tardiness or absence from work; being disorderly or intoxicated while at work; destruction of any of the employerâ€™s property; failure to meet established employer work standards; malingering; embezzlement or larceny of the employerâ€™s property; violating specific written company policy for which the action is a stated remedy of the violation.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-1-80 (Supp. 2005).Â  \r\nIn order to prove a claim under this section, a plaintiff must establish the following elements:Â  1) institution of workersâ€™ compensation proceedings; 2) discharge or demotion; and 3) a causal connection between the first two elements.Â  Hinton, 343 S.C. at 242, 540 S.E.2d at 97.Â  Our supreme court has adopted the â€œdeterminative factorâ€ test as the appropriate test of causation under section 41-1-80.Â  Wallace v. Milliken &amp; Co., 305 S.C. 118, 121, 406 S.E.2d 358, 360 (1991).Â  In applying this test, the court has stated that â€œ[t]he determinative factor test requires the employee establish that he would not have been discharged â€˜but forâ€™ the filing of the workersâ€™ compensation claim.â€Â  Hinton, 343 S.C. at 242, 540 S.E.2d at 97.Â  In terms of the burden of proof, our supreme court has further explained:\r\n\r\nThe ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the employer retaliatorily discharged the employee for exercising statutory rights under the Act remains at all times with the employee.Â  The burden of persuasion never shifts and the employee bears the burden of persuasion that the reason given for termination was pretextual . . . The employee may succeed in this, either directly by persuading the court that the discharge was significantly motivated by retaliation for her exercise of statutory rights, or indirectly by showing that the employerâ€™s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.Â  \r\nIf the employer articulates a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for the termination, the proximity in time between the work-related injury and the termination is not sufficient evidence to carry the employeeâ€™s burden of proving a causal connection.\r\n\r\nHinton, 343 S.C. at 242-43, 540 S.E.2d at 97 (citations omitted); Wallace, 305 S.C. at 122, 406 S.E.2d at 360.\r\nApplying the above-outlined standard of review in conjunction with the â€œdeterminative factorâ€ test, we find the masterâ€™s decision is supported by the evidence.Â  Although it is suspect that Tolbert was terminated less than two weeks after he indicated he would seek the advice of his attorney concerning leave under the Family Medical Leave Act, we find this fact alone is not sufficient to sustain Tolbertâ€™s burden of proof.Â  Instead, we find Sheriff Mims articulated a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for the termination by offering evidence of Tolbertâ€™s work history, which included reprimands and warnings.Â  \r\nSpecifically, Sheriff Mims, through his witnesses and documentation, identified the following disciplinary incidents:Â  1) on May 3, 1993, Tolbert was suspended for three days after he engaged in a verbal confrontation with another deputy while assisting in a traffic stop; 2) on July 1, 1993, Tolbert received a written warning for his attitude and tone of voice directed toward his supervisor despite a recommended twelve-day suspension of his patrol car driving privileges; 3) on August 26, 1996, Tolbert received a written warning for improper wear of his duty uniform at a mandatory departmental press appearance; 4) on December 28, 1996, Tolbert was suspended for seven days as the result of an internal investigation of a citizen complaint made against Tolbert for his actions during a traffic stop; 5) on November 1, 1997, Tolbert received a letter of reprimand for his â€œthoughtless comments,â€ expression of â€œnegative personal feelings,â€ and unprofessional actions during a COPS Leadership Council meeting; and 6) on February 7, 2001, Tolbert received a verbal warning resulting from a citizen complaint regarding a confrontational telephone conversation.Â  Additionally, while on light duty after his injury, Tolbert was instructed to wear more professional attire and counseled regarding his attitude in handling a citizen complaint.Â  \r\nAside from these disciplinary incidents, Tolbertâ€™s own testimony indicates Sheriff Mims did not terminate him for filing a workerâ€™s compensation claim.Â  Although Tolbert stated during the hearing that this was the reason for his termination, he testified during his deposition that he was fired:Â  1) â€œ[b]ecause of the love of Jesus Christ and I wouldnâ€™t let you talk to me like I was some little slaveâ€; and 2) for being honest. Â Â \r\nSignificantly, the Sheriffâ€™s Department also filed the workerâ€™s compensation claim on behalf of Tolbert, permitted him to return to work after his injury, offered him leave pursuant to the Family Medical Leave Act, and did not terminate him until approximately six months after the injury.Â Â  Furthermore, the record reveals that this was not Tolbertâ€™s only workerâ€™s compensation claim while employed with the Department.Â  Finally, to the extent Tolbertâ€™s claim that retaining an attorney precipitated his termination can be construed as evidence supporting the allegation of retaliatory discharge, we find any inference negligible and not sufficient to sustain Tolbertâ€™s ultimate burden of proof.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the decision of the master is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n GOOLSBY, BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â Â  The County of Sumter was dismissed pursuant to an agreement between the parties.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-331","title":"Sabb v.

Â Sabb slipped on a piece of wax paper near the registers, falling to the floor and injuring herself.Â  Her injuries included: pain in her neck and side; tingling and numbness in her left arm and running through her left hip and down her left leg; radiating pain in her neck; and fractures to two disks in her lower back.Â  The accident happened in the location where Sabb normally worked.Â  Sabb reported her injury to two supervisors and the store manager.Â  \r\nSabb sought medical treatment for her injuries and filed a workerâ€™s compensation claim.Â  Wal-Mart denied her injury was during the scope and course of her employment because she was on her unpaid lunch break when the injury occurred.Â  Sabb admitted that she was on her lunch break, and she could have spent her lunch break off of Wal-Mart property if she chose to.Â  She argued, however, that Wal-Mart strongly encouraged employees to stay and shop at the store during their lunch break, that Wal-Mart gave employees a ten percent discount, and that she was under the control of Wal-Mart while shopping there.Â  Both the single commissioner and the Full Commission found Sabbâ€™s injury did not arise out of the course and scope of her employment and was not compensable. Â Sabb appealed to the circuit court. \r\nAfter hearing arguments from the parties, the circuit court reversed the Full Commission and single commissioner.Â  The court relied on McCoy v. Easley Cotton Mills, 218 S.C. 350, 62 S.E.2d 772 (1950), and Sexton v. Freeman Gas Co., 258 S.C. 15, 187 S.E.2d 128 (1972) in finding Sabb suffered a compensable injury because she was subject to the recall and supervision of management while she was on Wal-Mart property.Â  Wal-Mart appeals. Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn workersâ€™ compensation cases, the Full Commission is the ultimate fact finder.â€Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  The Full Commission makes the final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be assigned to the evidence.Â  Id.Â  In an appeal from the Full Commission, neither the circuit court nor this court may substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005).Â  The appellate court can reverse or modify the Full Commissionâ€™s decision only if the claimantâ€™s substantial rights have been prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law or is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(e) (2005).Â  â€œThe question of whether an accident arises out of and is in the course and scope of employment is largely a question of fact for the full commission.â€Â  Pratt v. Morris Roofing, Inc., 357 S.C. 619, 622, 594 S.E.2d 272, 274 (2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Compensable Accident\r\nWal-Mart argues the circuit court erred in finding that Sabb sustained a compensable accident at work.Â  We agree.\r\nIn order to be compensable under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, an injury by accident must arise out of and be in the course of employment.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2005).Â  An injury arises out of employment when there is a â€œâ€˜causal connection between the conditions under which work is required to be performed and the resulting injury.â€™â€Â  Gray v. Club Group, Ltd., 339 S.C. 173, 187, 528 S.E.2d 435, 442 (Ct. App. 2000) (quoting Douglas v. Spartan Mills, Spartex Div., 245 S.C. 265, 269, 140 S.E.2d 173, 175 (1965)).Â  An injury occurs in the course of employment when it â€œoccurs within the period of employment at a place where the employee reasonably may be in the performance of his duties and while fulfilling those duties or while engaged in something incidental thereto.â€Â  Id. at 187-88, 528 S.E.2d at 443. \r\nPersonal activities that are necessary to the life, comfort, and convenience of the worker while at work, though not acts of service to the employer, are incidental to the service and any injury sustained during these activities are deemed to have arisen out of the employment for the purposes of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  Gibson v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. No. 3, 338 S.C. 510, 519, 526 S.E.2d 725, 730 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  This â€œpersonal comfort doctrineâ€ has been limited to â€œimperative acts such as eating, drinking, smoking, seeking relief from discomfort, preparing to begin or quit work, and resting or sleeping.â€Â  Osteen v. Greenville County Sch. Dist., 333 S.C. 43, 47-48, 508 S.E.2d 21, 23 (1998).\r\nIt is the claimantâ€™s burden to prove facts rendering the injury compensable under the Act.Â  Clade v. Champion Labs., 330 S.C. 8, 11, 496 S.E.2d 856, 857 (1998).Â  Workersâ€™ compensation laws are to be liberally construed in favor of coverage.Â  Peay v. U.S. Silica Co., 313 S.C. 91, 94, 437 S.E.2d 64, 65 (1993).Â  \r\nIn the present case, the circuit court referred to McCoy v. Easley Cotton Mills, 218 S.C. 350, 62 S.E.2d 772 (1950), and Sexton v. Freeman Gas Co., 258 S.C. 15, 187 S.E.2d 128 (1972) in reversing the Full Commissionâ€™s denial of benefits.Â  The court specifically noted that Sabbâ€™s claim was similar to the facts in Sexton because Sabb was â€œpermitted to leave the premises during her lunch break, but Wal-Mart encouraged her to eat on the premises and shop at Wal-Mart.Â  When she remained on the premises, she was subject to recall and the supervision of management.â€Â  \r\nIn McCoy, an employee lost an eye while on a smoking break when he was unintentionally struck with a copper tube by another employee.Â  The McCoy court found that the injury occurred in the course of the claimantâ€™s employment because smoking was something permitted by the employer.Â  McCoy, 218 S.C. at 354, 62 S.E.2d at 773-74 (â€œWe think it is clear that the accident occurred â€˜in the course ofâ€™ claimantâ€™s employment.Â  While smoking was not, of course, one the obligatory duties of his employment, yet it was something permitted by the employer.Â  Consequently, no break in claimantâ€™s employment resulted from the fact that he temporarily left his job and walked outside the building to smoke.â€).Â  \r\nIn Sexton, a salaried employee of the gas company left work in the company vehicle on a personal errand to get a haircut.Â  The vehicle was equipped with a two-way radio on which he could be summoned to perform company business at any time.Â  After his haircut, Sexton helped extinguish a brushfire, drove back to work on the shortest route possible, and was killed when his vehicle was struck by a train.Â  The Sexton court held the death was compensable under the statute because although the deceased was on a personal errand, â€œhe was continuously subject to his employerâ€™s controlâ€ because of the two-way radio.Â  Sexton, 258 S.C. at 18, 187 S.E.2d at 129.Â  Further, the court noted that extinguishing the brush fire was not part of his employment, but he â€œresumed the course of his employmentâ€ when he was returning to the office thereafter.Â  Id. at 19, 187 S.E.2d at 129-30.Â  \r\nWe find this case is distinguishable from both Sexton and McCoy.Â  Sabb testified that she was not doing anything related to her job at the time of her accident.Â  Although there was testimony that all Wal-Mart employees were encouraged to shop in the store and were given a ten percent discount as an incentive, there was no evidence that Sabb, or any other Wal-Mart employee, was required to stay in the store during breaks.Â  Sabb testified that she could have left the premises during her unpaid lunch break if she chose to.Â  Sabb was not a salaried employee, she had set hours for work, her injury occurred during her unpaid lunch break, and there was no evidence Sabb was subject to the control of Wal-Mart during her lunch break.Â  Further, shopping in the store for school supplies, even though strongly encouraged by Wal-Mart, is not a personal activity that would render Sabbâ€™s injury compensable under the â€œpersonal comfort doctrineâ€ as defined by our courts.Â  Osteen, 333 S.C. at 47-48, 508 S.E.2d at 23 (holding that activities that are considered within the scope of employment under the â€œpersonal comfort doctrineâ€ include eating, drinking, smoking, seeking relief from discomfort, preparing to begin or quit work, and resting or sleeping). Â \r\nSabb was not working at the time of her injury, was not engaged in an activity necessary to her personal comfort, and was not subject to Wal-Martâ€™s control during the time of her injury.Â  Shopping at Wal-Mart did not constitute a necessary personal activity pursuant to the â€œpersonal comfort doctrineâ€ as in McCoy.Â  Further, she was not subject to Wal-Martâ€™s control during her lunch break, as the claimant in Sexton.Â  Thus, Sabb did not sustain an injury during the course of her employment.Â  See Troutman v. Williams Furniture Corp., 224 S.C. 353, 358, 79 S.E.2d 374, 376 (1953) (noting that an employeeâ€™s death after being hit by a car while returning to work from lunch was not an accident arising out of or within the scope of his employment where employee was â€œkilled while on a public highway and about his own business, was not performing any duty for his employer, the appellant, and at a time when he was not paid for the performance of any duty for his employerâ€). \r\nThere was substantial evidence in the record to support both the single commissionerâ€™s and the Full Commissionâ€™s findings that Sabbâ€™s injuries did not occur within the scope of her employment.Â  Accordingly, we find the circuit court erred in reversing the Full Commissionâ€™s decision to uphold the denial of benefits.Â Â  \r\nII.Â  Substantial Evidence\r\nWal-Mart also alleges the circuit court exceeded its authority in reversing the Full Commission because there was substantial evidence to support the Full Commissionâ€™s findings.Â  We agree.\r\nThe Full Commission is the ultimate fact finder in workersâ€™ compensation cases.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  These factual findings must be upheld unless they are not supported by the substantial evidence of record or unless the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005).Â  Whether an accident â€œarises out of and is in the course and scope of employment is largely a question of fact for the full commission.â€Â  Pratt v. Morris Roofing, Inc., 357 S.C. 619, 622, 594 S.E.2d 272, 274 (2004).Â  \r\nThe single commissioner found that: Sabb was not performing any work-related activities at the time of her accident; her activities at that point were strictly personal in nature; her activities were not a natural incident of her employment; and there was no causal connection between her injury and her employment.Â  The single commissioner also found that Sabbâ€™s activities did not fall within the personal comfort doctrine and were not required by her employment.Â  Thus, the single commissioner found Sabb failed to prove her injury arose out of and in the course of her employment and denied benefits.Â  The Full Commission adopted the single commissionerâ€™s findings and upheld the denial of benefits.Â  The circuit court, however, found that Sabb was subject to recall and the supervision of management while she was on Wal-Mart property.Â  Thus, the court found her injury was compensable.Â  \r\nThere is substantial evidence in the record to support the single commissionerâ€™s and the Full Commissionâ€™s findings that Sabbâ€™s activities were not within the scope of her employment.Â  By contrast, there is nothing in the record to support the circuit courtâ€™s finding that Sabb was subject to recall or the supervision of management while she was shopping at Wal-Mart.Â  Because the Full Commissionâ€™s finding that Sabbâ€™s accident did not arise within the scope of her employment was supported by substantial evidence, the circuit court should have upheld the finding instead of making a new finding of fact.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court exceeded its scope of review. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause Sabbâ€™s injury did not occur within the scope of her employment, she was not entitled to Workersâ€™ Compensation benefits.Â  Further, the circuit court exceeded its authority by ignoring the Full Commissionâ€™s findings that were supported by the record and by making new findings of fact.Â  Accordingly, the order of the circuit court is reversed and the Full Commissionâ€™s findings are reinstated.Â  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nGOOLSBY, BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-332","title":"McCullar v.

McCullar additionally asserted a claim for loss of consortium.Â  Dr. Campbellâ€™s estate moved to dismiss the action, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), SCRCP, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  \r\nAt the motion hearing, Dr. Campbellâ€™s estate argued the circuit court lacked the power to hear the McCullarsâ€™ case because the probate court retained this matter in its exclusive original jurisdiction under section 62-1-302(a)(1) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005).Â  Dr. Campbellâ€™s estate claimed section 62-1-302(a)(1) confers exclusive original jurisdiction to the probate court for all subject matter related to decedentsâ€™ estates.\r\nThe McCullars countered that section 62-1-302(b) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) and section 62-3-804(2) of the South Carolina Code (1987) governed their lawsuit.Â  These sections provide respectively that the probate courtâ€™s jurisdiction â€œover matters involving wrongful death or actions under the survival statute is concurrent with that of the circuit court and extends only to the approval of settlementsâ€ and that a tort claimant may sue the personal representative of an estate in any court where the personal representative may be subjected to jurisdiction.[2]Â Â  \r\nRelying exclusively on section 62-1-302(a)(1) and Ex parte Estate of Evans v. Lynch, 299 S.C. 366, 384 S.E.2d 748 (1989), the circuit court agreed with Dr. Campbellâ€™s estate and granted the motion to dismiss.Â  The circuit court specifically found the McCullars must petition the probate court to reopen the estate and subsequently petition to have the case removed to the circuit court.Â  The McCullars filed a motion to alter or amend the order, which the circuit court denied on September 9, 2005.Â  \r\nWhile the circuit court was considering Dr. Campbellâ€™s estateâ€™s motion to dismiss, the McCullars petitioned the probate court to reopen Dr. Campbellâ€™s estate for the purpose of appointing a successor personal representative of the estate.Â  This was accomplished prior to the disposition of the motion to dismiss with the appointment of Joanne Dukes Campbell on August 19, 2005 as successor personal representative of the estate.Â  \r\nII.\r\nThe sole issue on appeal is whether the circuit court properly dismissed the McCullarsâ€™ suit against Dr. Campbellâ€™s estate on the grounds that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the tort claims against Dr. Campbellâ€™s estate.Â  \r\nThe circuit court relied exclusively on section 62-1-302(a)(1) and Ex parte Estate of Evans v. Lynch in dismissing the McCullarsâ€™ action.Â  These authorities do not resolve the subject matter jurisdiction issue Dr. Campbellâ€™s estate presented to the circuit court.Â  Although section 62-1-302(a)(1) provides the probate court with exclusive original jurisdiction â€œover all subject matter related to . . . estates of decedents, including the contest of wills, construction of wills, and determination of heirs and successors of decedents and estates of protected persons,â€ when read in light of the other sections of the probate code, it is clear tort claims against an estate are not limited to the probate courtâ€™s exclusive original subject matter jurisdiction.Â  See \r\nS.C. State Ports Auth. v. Jasper County, 368 S.C. 388, 398, 629 S.E.2d 624, 629 (2006) (â€œIn construing statutory language, the statute must be read as a whole and sections which are a part of the same general statutory law must be construed together and each one given effect.â€).Â  For example, section 62-3-804(2) of the South Carolina Code (1987) allows a tort claimant to sue the personal representative of an estate in any court where the personal representative may be subjected to jurisdiction.Â  \r\nThe circuit courtâ€™s reliance on Ex parte Estate of Evans for the proposition that the probate court has exclusive original subject matter jurisdiction over tort claims against a decedentâ€™s estate was also misplaced.Â  In Ex parte Estate of Evans, the respondent filed a petition to reopen an estate in order to assert a medical malpractice claim against the estate and decedentâ€™s liability insurer.Â  299 S.C. at 367, 384 S.E.2d at 749.Â  The circuit court affirmed the probate courtâ€™s ruling that reopening the estate was permissible under section 62-3-803(c)(2), which allows liability claims against an estate otherwise not permitted by the nonclaim sections of the statute to the extent the decedent was protected by liability insurance.Â  Id.Â  On appeal before the supreme court, the appellant liability insurer argued section 62-3-803(c)(2) denied it equal protection of the law.Â  Id.Â  The court held that section 62-3-803(c)(2) does not violate the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions.Â  Id. at 368, 384 S.E.2d at 750.Â  The court did not, however, hold that the probate court had exclusive original subject matter jurisdiction over the claim.\r\nA case more in line with the case at bar is Kolb v. Cook, 284 S.C. 598, 327 S.E.2d 379 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  In Kolb, the respondents brought a medical malpractice suit against a physicianâ€™s estate.Â  Id. at 599-600, 327 S.E.2d at 380.Â  The physicianâ€™s estate argued the respondents were required to satisfy procedural requirements of the probate court before prosecuting their tort claim in circuit court.Â  Id. at 601, 327 S.E.2d at 381.Â  This court found, â€œWhere, as here, the survival statute permits a suit directly against the personal representative in the court of common pleas, the claimant of such assets may bypass the probate court if, at the commencement of the action, there is a suable estate representative.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nAs in Kolb, the McCullarsâ€™ claims are â€œsurvival claimsâ€ pursuant to section 15-5-90.Â  Section 62-1-302(b) provides that the probate courtâ€™s â€œjurisdiction over matters involving . . . actions under the survival statute is concurrent with that of the circuit court and extends only to the approval of settlements as provided in Sections 15-51-41 and 15-51-42 and to the allocation of settlement proceeds among the parties involved in the estate.â€Â  In Kolb, a case almost identical to the present one, this court held the claimant â€œmay bypass the probate court.â€Â  284 S.C. at 601, 327 S.E.2d at 381.\r\nBypassing the probate court would not be possible if the probate court had exclusive subject matter jurisdiction.Â  \r\nAdmittedly, there was a suable personal representative in Kolb at the commencement of that suit.Â  The motion of Dr. Campbellâ€™s estate, however, turned exclusively on the argument of exclusive original subject matter jurisdiction in the probate court pursuant to section 62-1-302(a)(1) â€“ not the absence of a suable personal representative.Â  â€œSubject matter jurisdiction is â€˜the power of a court to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.â€™â€Â  Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 237-38, 442 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1994) (quoting Bank of Babylon v. Quirk, 192 Conn. 447, 472 A.2d 21, 22 (1984)).Â  Subject matter jurisdiction does not depend on the capacity of the parties to sue or be sued.Â  See Bardoon Props., NV v. Eidolon Corp., 326 S.C. 166, 170, 485 S.E.2d 371, 373 (1997); see also Chet Adams Co. v. James F. Pedersen Co., 307 S.C. 33, 36-37, 413 S.E.2d 827, 829 (1992). Â Moreover, Dr. Campbellâ€™s estate was reopened and the personal representative reappointed before the motion to dismiss was concluded in the circuit court.\r\nIII.\r\nThe narrow grounds relied upon by Dr. Campbellâ€™s estate and adopted by the circuit court provide no basis to conclude that the circuit court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to hear a medical malpractice action against an estate.Â  To the contrary, a fair reading and careful review of the probate code leads to the conclusion that the circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction over such tort claims against an estate.Â  The circuit court erred in dismissing the McCullarsâ€™ suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in the circuit court.Â  We therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings.\r\n REVERSED and REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON, KITTREDGE, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Under section 62-3-803(a)(1) and (c)(2) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005), claims against a decedentâ€™s estate are generally barred one year after the decedentâ€™s death, except for claims against the decedentâ€™s liability insurance.Â  Because this case involves liability insurance, there is no challenge to the timeliness of the suit.Â  \r\n[2]&nbsp; The survival statute, section 15-5-90 of the South Carolina Code (2005), provides that causes of action for and in respect to any and all injuries to the person shall survive both to and against the personal or representative of a deceased person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-333","title":"Robinson v.

Sabatinos, PA (Defendants). On May 1, 2003, Robinson filed a medical malpractice action on behalf of his deceased wifeâ€™s estate against Defendants.Â  Jury selection began on March 21, 2005.Â  \r\nDuring jury selection, Defendantsâ€™ attorney (Mr. Davis) exercised the following strikes: first, Juror Number Twelve (a fifty-year-old single black female); second, Strike List Number Two[2] (a white male); third, Juror Number Ten (a nineteen year old unemployed black female); and fourth, Juror Number 179 (a twenty-four-year-old black female).Â  Mr. Davis also struck two alternate jurors.Â  Robinson made a timely Batson Motion claiming the strikes were racially discriminatory. \r\nMr. Davis claimed the reason for striking Juror Number Twelve was that she as â€œa 53-year-old black female would more identify with the 52-year-old decedent in this case than she would any other party.â€Â  Mr. Davis pointed out that one of his clients was black.Â  Mr. Davis stated the reason for striking Juror Number 179 was because she had limited education and limited life experience due to her youth.Â  Mr. Davis claimed the reason for striking Juror Number Ten was she was too young and unemployed.Â  Mr. Davis also claimed he did not realize this juror was black.Â  Robinson claimed Mr. Davisâ€™s reasons were pretextual.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nRobinsonâ€™s motion was denied and the jury was seated.Â  The trial began on March 21, 2005.Â  The jury rendered a verdict for Defendants on March 25, 2005.Â  Robinson moved for a new trial on April 1, 2005.Â  The Batson issues raised during jury selection were the only issues in Robinsonâ€™s Motion for a New Trial.Â  On May 11, 2005, the circuit court denied Robinsonâ€™s Motion for a New Trial.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhether a Batson violation has occurred must be determined by examining the totality of the facts and circumstances in the record. Â Riddle v. State, 314 S.C. 1, 443 S.E.2d 557 (1994). Â The opponent of the strike carries the ultimate burden of persuading the trial court the challenged party exercised strikes in a discriminatory manner. Â State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996). Â Appellate courts give the trial judgeâ€™s finding great deference on appeal, and review the trial judgeâ€™s ruling with a clearly erroneous standard. Â State v. Dyar, 317 S.C. 77, 452 S.E.2d 603 (1994).\r\nThe trial judgeâ€™s findings of purposeful discrimination rest largely on his evaluation of demeanor and credibility. Â Sumpter v. State, 312 S.C. 221, 439 S.E.2d 842 (1994). Often the demeanor of the challenged attorney will be the best and only evidence of discrimination, and â€œevaluation of the prosecutorâ€™s mind lies peculiarly within a trial judgeâ€™s province.â€ Â Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the striking of a venire person on the basis of race or gender. Â State v. Hicks, 330 S.C. 207, 499 S.E.2d 209 (1998). When one party strikes a member of a cognizable racial group or gender, the trial court must hold a Batson hearing if the opposing party requests one. Â See generally State v. Haigler, 334 S.C. 623, 515 S.E.2d 88 (1999). The proponent of the strike must offer a race or gender neutral explanation. Â Id. The opponent must show the race or gender neutral explanation was mere pretext, which is generally established by showing the party did not strike a similarly situated member of another race or gender. Under some circumstances, the explanation given by the proponent may be so fundamentally implausible the trial judge may determine the explanation was mere pretext, even without a showing of disparate treatment. Â Id.\r\nIn the present case, racial discrimination was the only issue Robinson raised to the circuit court.Â  â€œ[A]n issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998).Â Â  Therefore, our review will focus solely on racial discrimination.\r\nRobinson did not present any evidence during the Batson hearing that Mr. Davis seated any other similarly situated juror of a different race.Â  Robinson simply pointed out Mr. Davis said he would like jurors with more life experience, and Juror Number Twelve should meet that criteria due to her being 53 years of age.Â  Robinson claimed the only reason Juror Number Twelve could identify more with the decedent was due to her being black.Â  These were the only arguments raised by Robinson to show Mr. Davisâ€™s reasons were merely pretexts to justify the strikes.Â  Robinson did not specifically address any of the other challenged strikes.Â Â Â  \r\nThis argument was countered by Mr. Davisâ€™s statement that Juror Number Twelve was struck for the same reason that Juror Number Two, a white male, was struck.Â  Juror Number Twoâ€™s wife was disabled, and he was struck because Mr. Davis felt he may identify more with the decedent due to his wifeâ€™s and the decedentâ€™s disabilities.Â  Mr. Davis had already pointed out to the court that one of his clients was black.Â  This undermines Robinsonâ€™s claim that Mr. Davisâ€™s concern about Juror Number Twelve more closely identifying with the decedent than any other party was racially motivated.\r\nThe burden of showing pretext is on the party challenging the strike.Â  The striking party does not have to show that the reason they assert is not pretextual. Â See generally State v. Haigler, 334 S.C. 623, 515 S.E.2d 88 (1999).Â  The trial court found that Defendants had offered a racially neutral, plausible reason for the strikes, and that Robinson had not met the burden of challenging the strikes.Â  Appellate courts give the trial judgeâ€™s finding great deference on appeal, and review the trial judgeâ€™s ruling with a clearly erroneous standard.

Ernest Kinard, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-334\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Submitted September 1, 2006 â€“ Filed September 20, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nKeith W. Sheppard, of Ridgeland, Pro Se.\r\nTeresa A. Knox, J. Benjamin Aplin, and Tommy Evans, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  After the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services (Department) failed to conduct a parole hearing for Keith Sheppard in 2003, Sheppard filed a claim against the Department for gross negligence.Â  The trial court dismissed the case under Rule 12(b)(2), (4), (5), and (6), SCRCP, as well as finding res judicata barred the claim.Â  Sheppard appeals arguing his procedural due process rights were violated because the trial court failed to conduct a hearing before dismissing his case with prejudice.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn March 20, 1985, Sheppard was convicted of assault and battery with intent to kill (ABIK) and armed robbery.Â  The trial court sentenced Sheppard to twenty-five years imprisonment for armed robbery and twenty years for ABIK, to run consecutively.Â  Sheppard became eligible for parole in 1992.Â  In 1996, the Department began conducting parole hearings every other year instead of every year.Â  In 2000, the Department resumed yearly parole hearings as instructed by the South Carolina Supreme Court.[2]Â  Sheppard had parole hearings in 2000, 2001, and 2002.Â  At the end of 2003, Sheppard was informed his next parole hearing would be for parole in the year 2004.Â  \r\nOn April 9, 2004, Sheppard filed a claim against the Department for negligence in failing to conduct his 2003 parole hearing (April Claim).[3]Â  On July 13, 2004, the court dismissed the action with prejudice for several reasons including: â€œ(1) lack of subject matter jurisdiction; (2) insufficiency of process; and (3) failure to state a cause of action.â€ Â It appears that Sheppard did not appeal the dismissal. \r\nA few months later, Sheppard brought the claim (November Claim) now before us.Â  The Department filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2), (4), (5), and (6), SCRCP.Â  Further, the Department alleged res judicata barred the claim.Â  The trial court dismissed the case with prejudice on the following grounds: (1) lack of subject matter jurisdiction; (2) insufficiency of process; (3) insufficiency of service of process; (4) failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action due to the South Carolina Tort Claims Act and the Public Duty Rule; and (5) res judicata.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œA trial courtâ€™s grant of a motion to dismiss will be sustained only if the facts alleged in the complaint do not support relief under any theory of law.â€ Â McEachern v. Black, 329 S.C. 642, 647, 496 S.E.2d 659, 661 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  When reviewing a dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, we apply the same standard of review as the trial court.Â \r\nDoe v. Marion, 361 S.C. 463, 470, 605 S.E.2d 556, 560 (Ct. App. 2004), cert. granted, Apr. 19, 2006.Â  The trial courtâ€™s ruling on a 12(b)(6) motion must be based solely on the allegations in the complaint.\r\nÂ Williams v. Condon, 347 S.C. 227, 233, 553 S.E.2d 496, 499 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The pleadings must be construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSheppard claims the trial court erred in dismissing the November Claim with prejudice without first conducting a hearing and thus, violated his procedural due process rights.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe doctrine of res judicata is based on the principle that public interest requires an end to litigation and that no one\r\nshould be sued twice for the same cause of action.Â  Town of Sullivanâ€™s Island v. Felger,&nbsp;318 S.C. 340, 344, 457 S.E.2d 626, 628&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995).Â  â€œRes judicata is the branch of the law that defines the effect a valid judgment may have on subsequent litigation between the same parties and their privies. Â Res judicata ends litigation, promotes judicial economy and avoids the harassment of relitigation of the same issues.â€ Â Nelson v. QHG of S.C., Inc., 354 S.C. 290, 304, 580 S.E.2d 171, 178 (Ct. App. 2003) (quoting James F. Flanagan, South Carolina Civil Procedure 642 (2d ed. 1996)), revâ€™d in part on other grounds, 362 S.C. 421, 608 S.E.2d 855 (2005).Â  â€œRes judicata bars subsequent actions by the same parties when the claims arise out of the same transaction or occurrence that was the subject of a prior action between those parties.â€Â \r\nPlum Creek Dev. Co. v. City of Conway, 334 S.C. 30, 34, 512 S.E.2d 106, 109 (1999). Â A party seeking to preclude litigation on the grounds of res judicata must show: (1) identity of the parties; (2) identity of the subject matter; and (3) adjudication of the issue in the former suit.Â  Id.\r\nThe parties in the current action, Sheppard and the Department, are identical to the parties in the first action.Â  Although Sheppard did not include the complaint from the April Claim in the record, an examination of the order of dismissal reveals that Sheppard alleged negligence arising out of the Departmentâ€™s failure to conduct a parole hearing for 2003.Â  Accordingly, we find the subject matter of the November Claim is identical to the subject matter of the April Claim.Â  See \r\nVenture Engâ€™g, Inc. v. Tishman Constr. Corp. of S.C., 360 S.C. 156, 162, 600 S.E.2d 547, 550 (Ct. App. 2004) (holding res judicata not only bars claims previously brought, but any claims that could have been raised in the former suit).\r\nFurther, we find that the third element is met because the April Claim was adjudicated on the merits when the trial court determined the South Carolina Tort Claims Act barred the claim.Â  â€œA case that is dismissed â€˜with prejudiceâ€™ indicates an adjudication on the merits and, pursuant to res judicata, prohibits subsequent litigation to the same extent as if the action had been tried to a final adjudication.â€Â \r\nNelson, 354 S.C. at 311, 580 S.E.2d at 182. Â Accordingly, the trial court properly found res judicata barred the November Claim.Â  Because the trial court could determine solely from the complaint and the previous order that res judicata applied, a hearing was unnecessary and the trial court did not err in dismissing the case before holding a hearing.\r\nThe trial court also dismissed the November Claim under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, finding the Department had immunity under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.Â  â€œThe Tort Claims Act governs all tort claims against governmental entities and is the exclusive civil remedy available in an action against a governmental entity . . . .â€Â \r\nFlateau v. Harrelson, 355 S.C. 197, 203, 584 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The provisions of the Act â€œmust be liberally construed in favor of limiting the liability of the State.â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-20(f) (2005).Â  The Act provides in part:\r\n\r\nThe governmental entity is not liable for a loss resulting from: (1) legislative, judicial, or quasi-judicial action or inaction; (2) administrative action or inaction of a legislative, judicial, or quasi-judicial nature; (3) execution, enforcement, or implementation of the orders of any court or execution, enforcement, or lawful implementation of any process; [or] (4) adoption, enforcement, or compliance with any law or failure to adopt or enforce any law, whether valid or invalid, including, but not limited to, any charter, provision, ordinance, resolution, rule, regulation, or written policies. . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60 (2005).\r\nThe immunity provided by the Act is an affirmative defense.Â \r\nFrazier v. Badger, 361 S.C. 94, 101, 603 S.E.2d 587, 590 (2004).Â  Generally, an affirmative defense may not be asserted in a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss unless the allegations of the complaint demonstrate the existence of the affirmative defense.Â \r\nSpence v. Spence, 368 S.C. 106, 123, 628 S.E.2d 869, 878 (2006).Â  However, \r\n\r\n[m]ost courts allow such defenses to be raised in a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b) when there is no disputed issue of fact raised by an affirmative defense, or the facts are completely disclosed on the face of the pleadings, and realistically nothing further can be developed by pretrial discovery or a trial on the issue raised by the defense. \r\n\r\nId. (citations omitted).\r\nIn the present case, even if we take everything in Sheppardâ€™s pleadings as true, Sheppardâ€™s November Claim is barred by the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.Â  The parole boardâ€™s failure to hold a parole hearing one year would qualify for immunity under the Act.Â  Because the court must decide a 12(b)(6) motion based solely on the pleadings, the trial court was not required to hold a hearing before granting the motion.Â \r\nHiggins v. Med. Univ. of S.C., 326 S.C. 592, 603, 486 S.E.2d 269, 274 (Ct. App. 1997) (â€œIn deciding a motion to dismiss pursuant to 12(b)(6), the trial court should only consider the allegations set forth on the face of the plaintiff's complaint . . . .â€).Â  Accordingly, because it is apparent on the face of the complaint that the Department has immunity for its failure to conduct a parole hearing, the trial court did not err in dismissing the November Claim under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, without conducting a hearing before the dismissal.[4]Â  \r\nNext, Sheppard argues the April Claim should have been dismissed without prejudice, and therefore, he could bring the November Claim.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, we note this argument is not preserved for review on appeal because Sheppard did not raise it at trial nor did the trial court rule on it.Â \r\nSee  In re Michael H., 360 S.C. 540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729, 732 (2004) (â€œAn issue may not be raised for the first time on appeal.Â  In order to preserve an issue for appeal, it must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.â€); Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505, 510-11, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004) (â€œIt is well settled that, but for a very few exceptional circumstances, an appellate court cannot address an issue unless it was raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.â€).\r\nAverting to the merits, a trial courtâ€™s dismissal of a complaint for insufficiency under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, is generally without prejudice.Â  See \r\nOwens v. Atl. Coast Lumber Corp., 108 S.C. 258, 261, 94 S.E. 15, 16 (1917).Â  However, when a trial court examines the complaint and discovers the plaintiff is entitled to no relief under any circumstances, dismissal is proper and will bar another action for the same claim.Â  Id.Â  Here, if Sheppard took exception with the trial courtâ€™s ruling on the April Claim, he should have appealed the dismissal with prejudice, instead of filing a new action.Â  Because he did not appeal, the law of the case is that the April Claim was dismissed with prejudice.Â  See \r\nS.C. Coastal Conservation League v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 363 S.C. 67, 76, 610 S.E.2d 482, 487 (2005) (â€œA ruling not challenged on appeal is the law of the case, regardless of the correctness of the ruling.â€). Â We find no merit to Sheppardâ€™s claim that the trial court improperly dismissed the April Claim.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial court properly determined res judicata barred the November Claim and the Department had immunity under the Tort Claims Act.Â  Therefore, the trial court properly dismissed the November Claim.Â  Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of the matter is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, KITTREDGE, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n[2] See  Jernigan v. State, 340 S.C. 256, 264-65, 531 S.E.2d 507, 512 (2000) (â€œ[W]e hold that the change from annual parole eligibility review to biannual review â€˜produces a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of\r\npunishment attached to the covered crimes,â€™ and therefore, any retroactive application . . . constitutes an ex post facto violation.â€).\r\n[3] Only the order of dismissal from the April Claim is included in the record on appeal.Â  The April Claim appears to arise out of the same circumstances and involve similar if not identical issues as the current action.Â  Because the complaint from the April Claim is not included in the record, the exact allegations raised by it are unclear.\r\n[4] Because we determine dismissal was proper under the doctrine of res judicata and Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, we need not address whether the dismissal was proper on the remaining grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-335","title":"Robinson v.

Marvin Mullis, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The City of Columbia (City) appeals the decision of the circuit court affirming the order of the South Carolina Workerâ€™s Compensation Commission (the Commission) denying its Petition/Motion to Amend, Set Aside or Vacate, or Alternatively, Motion to Review Awards on Change of Condition Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§42-17-90.Â  We affirm.[1]Â Â Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nDonald Robinson (Robinson) was an employee of the City.Â  Robinson filed multiple form 50s seeking workersâ€™ compensation benefits for the following work place injuries: 1) an injury to his right elbow; 2) carpal tunnel syndrome; 3) injury to his right shoulder; 4) injury to his right arm; &amp; 5) re-injury to his right shoulder.Â  The City answered by filing form 51s admitting the injury to Robinsonâ€™s right elbow, right arm, and right shoulder but denying the re-injury of his right shoulder and carpal tunnel syndrome.Â  Â Â \r\nAll of Robinsonâ€™s claims were heard together.Â  On October 31, 2001, the Single Commissioner issued an order awarding Robinson permanent partial disability benefits for his right upper extremity but denying the claim for carpal tunnel syndrome.Â  Robinson appealed this order to the full Commission.Â Â  By order dated May 9, 2002, the Commission found Robinsonâ€™s bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome to be compensable and remanded the matter to the Single Commissioner for a hearing on benefits.Â  The City did not appeal this decision.Â  \r\nFollowing the hearing commissionerâ€™s award, the City placed Robinson under surveillance.Â  The City believed it had proof that Robinson had no impairment due to his injuries, or that he had improved to the point that he was able to do heavy physical labor. Based on the surveillance evidence the City filed a Petition/Motion to Amend, Set Aside or Vacate, or Alternatively, Motion to Review Awards on Change of Condition Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§42-17-90.\r\nOn December 23, 2002, the Single Commissioner issued a transmittal order denying the Cityâ€™s Petition/Motion because a â€œMotion for Change of Condition only per Section 42-17-90 â€¦.â€ The City filed a form 30 seeking review of the denial.Â  On February 12, 2003 the Single Commissioner issued an order denying the Cityâ€™s Petition/Motion for the following reasons: first, the Commission will not address a motion involving the merits of a claim; and second, the party claiming a change in condition must attach to its hearing request form medical report(s) indicating there has been a change in condition.\r\nThe City appealed this denial to the Appellate Panel.Â  On October 17, 2003, the Appellate Panel affirmed the decision of the Single Commissioner and adopted the Single Commissionerâ€™s order.Â  The City appealed this decision to the circuit court.Â  On September 23, 2004 the circuit court affirmed the decision of the Appellate Panel.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  S.C.Code Ann.Â Â  Â§1-23-380 (2005); Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 132, 276 S.E.2d 304, 305 (1981).Â  The scope of judicial review of agency decisions is governed by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005).Â  Brown v. South Carolina Dept. of Health and Envtl. Control&nbsp; 348 S.C. 507, 515, 560 S.E.2d 410, 414&nbsp;(2002).Â  â€œThe appellate courtâ€™s review is limited to deciding whether the commissionâ€™s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law.â€Â  Hendricks v. Pickens County, 335 S.C. 405, 411, 517 S.E.2d 698, 701 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  If the parties in a workersâ€™ compensation action fail to timely appeal the order of the full commission, its order is conclusive and binding as to all questions of fact.Â  Gattis v. Murrells Inlet VFW # 10420 353 S.C. 100, 576 S.E.2d 191 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe City claims the denial of its Petition/Motion was a denial of due process, an abuse of discretion, and an error of law.Â  We do not agree.\r\nThe Cityâ€™s argument was basically that it was entitled to relief for one of two reasons: 1) the award should be set aside because Robinson had no impairment and had committed fraud; or 2) Robinsonâ€™s condition had changed to the point that he was no longer impaired.Â  Neither of these reasons entitled the City to the relief it sought.Â  Section 42-3-30 of the South Carolina Code (1976) authorizes the commission to create regulations related to workersâ€™ compensation laws of this State.Â  It provides that the commission â€œshall promulgate all regulations relating to the administration of the workersâ€™ compensation laws of this State . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-3-30 (1976).Â Â  \r\nRegulation 67-215B provides: the Commission will not address a motion involving the merits of the claim.Â  The Cityâ€™s claim of fraud is an attack on the merits of Robinsonâ€™s claim.Â  A motion is not the proper method to raise such an issue.Â  The City should have placed this issue before the Commission during the hearing on the merits when Robinsonâ€™s claim was being resolved.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe Cityâ€™s claimed change of condition must also fail. Regulation 67-602C states the party claiming a change of condition â€œmustâ€ attach to the hearing request form a medical report indicating a change in the claimant's condition.Â  The only evidence that the City had to offer was the surveillance evidence.Â  The circuit court found that the City failed to attach a medical report indicating that there was a change in condition.\r\nFor the reasons stated above we find no error in the circuit courtâ€™s order affirming the Commission. The circuit courtâ€™s order is therefore\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, KITTREDGE, and SHORT, JJ., concur.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-336","title":"State v.

Scott, of Pelzer, Â for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott\r\nSenior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; and Solicitor Robert M. Ariail, Â of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Brian William Scott appeals the circuit courtâ€™s denial of his motion for a new trial, arguing the State violated his due process rights by failing to comply with Rule 5, SCRCrimP and the mandates of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn February 1997, a jury found Brian William Scott guilty of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment.Â  At his trial, the State relied heavily on the testimony of James Johnson and Tyrone Adams, both present at the alleged murder of Tyrone Longino.\r\nAccording to James Johnsonâ€™s trial testimony, he met Scott while working at a local restaurant a couple of weeks prior to the incident in question.Â  Johnson testified he left work around 10:30 p.m. on the night of February 14, 1992.Â  While walking to a friendâ€™s house, Johnson ran into Scott, Adams, Longino, and another co-worker.Â  He was introduced to Adams and Longino for the first time.Â  The group then went to an apartment shared by Scott and Longino and proceeded to consume alcohol and smoke marijuana.Â  At some point, Johnsonâ€™s other co-worker left.Â  The remaining four then spent some time driving around in Longinoâ€™s car and making phone calls in an attempt to purchase drugs.\r\nFollowing several failed attempts to secure a drug purchase, the group pulled into a gas station.Â  Adams exited the vehicle and walked to a nearby phone to page a potential seller.Â  Johnson testified that an argument then ensued between Scott and Longino over the roommateâ€™s apparent lack of enthusiasm for the drug purchase.Â  According to Johnson, Scott became increasingly aggravated at Longino and eventually began strangling him with an unknown object from his position in the seat directly behind Longino.Â  Once Longino was rendered unconscious, Scott ordered Adams and Johnson to help him move the victim into the front passenger seat.Â  He instructed Adams to drive as Johnson and he returned to the back seat.Â  Johnson testified that shortly thereafter, Scott suddenly pulled out a large kitchen knife and reaching around from the back seat, he stabbed Longino in the chest.\r\nAccording to Johnson, Scott then directed Adams to drive to a nearby park where Scott and Adams placed Longinoâ€™s body in a dumpster.Â  Afterwards, Scott returned to his apartment.Â  Adams and Johnson drove Longinoâ€™s car to Adamsâ€™ apartment and smoked crack until Johnson reported to work the following morning.\r\nOn February 15, Greenville police received a call reporting a parked car at a local apartment complex that appeared to have a bloodstained interior.Â  Officers located the vehicle and checked the suspected driverâ€™s apartment.Â  In the apartment, officers found Adams, who claimed he borrowed the car from Longino and explained the blood stains were a result of an unfortunate nosebleed.Â  Adams admitted to partially cleaning out the car and revealed the location of his bloodstained clothing.Â  He was arrested for an outstanding warrant, and the car was impounded.Â  Police verified that the car belonged to Longino.\r\nThe police then attempted to locate Longino at his apartment to confirm Adamsâ€™ nosebleed claim.Â  At Longinoâ€™s apartment, officers encountered Scott for the first time.Â  Scott had a large knife stuck in the back of his belt, which was taken by the police.Â  He claimed he had not seen Longino in days, but he acted nervous around the investigating officers.Â  After Scott refused to consent to a search of his apartment, the officers returned the knife and left the residence.\r\nAt approximately 11:30 p.m. that night, the Greenville City Police received a call from county authorities reporting that a body was found in a dumpster at a local park.Â  The body was identified as Longino.Â  Injuries to the body confirmed he was strangled and stabbed once in the chest.\r\nOfficers then interrogated Adams a second time regarding the events of February 14.Â  At this point, Adams submitted a written statement claiming Scott strangled and stabbed Longino, and the group then helped him hide the body in the park dumpster.Â  Pursuant to Adamsâ€™ revised statement, an arrest warrant was issued for Scott.Â  Through an anonymous tip, Scott was located hiding under a bed at his girlfriendâ€™s apartment, the large knife still in his possession.Â  After his arrest, Scott refused to answer questions concerning the death of his roommate.Â  On February 18, Johnson turned himself in to police after seeing a story about the murder on the local news.Â  Johnson then submitted a written statement consistent with Adamsâ€™ recollection of Longinoâ€™s death.Â  \r\nScott, Adams, and Johnson were indicted for Longinoâ€™s murder.Â  In 1992, the charges against Scott were dismissed, presumably due to an issue concerning the location of witnesses.Â  In 1996, however, Scott was re-indicted for murder and tried before a jury.Â  Scottâ€™s trial took place prior to any prosecution of Adams or Johnson regarding Longinoâ€™s death.\r\nAs previously stated, the State relied heavily on Johnsonâ€™s and Adamsâ€™ testimony concerning the events in question.Â  Adamsâ€™ trial testimony regarding Longinoâ€™s murder was consistent with that of Johnson, reviewed above.Â  Particularly germane to this appeal, Adams testified he returned to the car from the gas station pay phone to find Scott strangling Longino with what appeared to be a piece of rope.Â  Adams also testified he witnessed Scott stab Longino from the rear seat.Â  The jury found Scott guilty of murder and, the judge sentenced him to life imprisonment.Â  Adams eventually pled guilty to obstruction of justice and received a seven year sentence with credit for time served.\r\nIn 2000, Scott retained counsel and initiated a post conviction relief action (PCR).Â  Scottâ€™s PCR counsel filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the 13th Circuit Solicitorâ€™s Office seeking all information in any way related to the death of Longino.Â  After an extended, often heated, exchange of phone calls and letters with the solicitorâ€™s office, the requested documents were eventually turned over to Scottâ€™s counsel.\r\nIncluded in these documents was a certified written statement signed by Adams entitled â€œNotice of Intended Pleaâ€ and dated May 20, 1994.Â  In this document, Adams avers the following:\r\n\r\n3. Defendant [Adams] was, consistent with prior statement(s), talking on the telephone in the area of the crime having no knowledge of the act until he entered the vehicle in which he was a passenger, finding the body of the victim.\r\n4. Relative to the actual perpetrator of the crime, Defendant could only speculate as to whom the actual perpetrator was as he (Defendant) did not witness the act.\r\n. . . .\r\n6. Defendant freely admits that he drove the car belonging to the victim, that he was merely present during the commission of the crime, with that presence being out of sight of the crime and without the knowledge of the act being in progress.\r\n\r\nThe signed â€œverification/certification of serviceâ€ block to this document reads â€œI have placed the original and one copy of this document in the U.S. Mail at the Lee Correctional Institution at Bishopville, SC, addressed to the; CLERK OF COURT, GREENVILLE COUNTY COURT HOUSE, GREENVILLE, SC:Â  OFFICE OF THE SOLICITOR, GREENVILLE COUNTY, GREENVILLE, SC.â€ (emphasis in original)\r\nThis document was not provided to Scott pursuant to his Rule 5, SCRCrimP and Brady motions prior to his murder trial.Â  According to Scottâ€™s former PCR counsel, the document was present in the Greenville County Clerk of Courtâ€™s Office in Adamsâ€™ file numbered 98-GS-23-2330, which is the enumeration for Adamsâ€™ obstruction of justice case.Â  Although the document also relates to Adamsâ€™ murder charge and is numbered accordingly (92-GS-23-7889), Scottâ€™s former PCR counsel stated in writing that the document was not present in Adamsâ€™ murder charge case file when she searched it in January 2000.\r\nScott filed a Rule 29(b), SCRCrimP, motion for a new trial in the circuit court, arguing that the Stateâ€™s withholding of this document violated his due process rights by failing to comply with Rule 5, and the mandates of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).Â  The circuit court denied the motion, concluding the document, filed with the clerk of court, was a matter of public record. Â Thus, it was available to a diligent defendant and not within the scope of a Brady motion.Â  The circuit court also denied the motion because the document complained of was merely cumulative and impeaching.Â  Further, the trial court found the document was not the nature of evidence which would result in a different outcome in a new trial.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nScott argues the circuit court erred in denying his Rule 29(b) motion for a new trial because the Stateâ€™s failure to provide Adamsâ€™ sworn statement to the defense violated his due process rights by failing to comply with Rule 5, and the mandates of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).[1]Â  We disagree.\r\nTo prevail on a Rule 29(b) motion for a new trial based upon after discovered evidence, Scott must show the after discovered evidence: (1) is such that would probably change the result if a new trial were granted; (2) has been discovered since the trial; (3) could not in the exercise of due diligence have been discovered prior to the trial; (4) is material; and (5) is not merely cumulative or impeaching.Â  State v. Spann, 334 S.C. 618, 513 S.E.2d 98 (1999).\r\nFurther, Rule 5 provides in pertinent part that upon request of the defendant, the prosecution shall permit the defendant to inspect and copy documents, which are material to the preparation of his defense or are intended for use by the prosecution as evidence in chief at the trial.Â  Rule 5(C), SCRCrimP.\r\nFinally, it is a violation of a defendantâ€™s due process rights for the prosecution to withhold evidence favorable to the defendant where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment.Â  Brady, 373 U.S. at 87.Â  This rule applies to impeachment evidence as well as exculpatory evidence.Â  U.S. v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667 (1985).Â  â€œA fair analysis of the holding in Brady indicates that implicit in the requirement of materiality is a concern that the suppressed evidence might have affected the outcome of the trial.â€Â  Id. at 674-75.Â  In addition, this Court recognizes there is no general public records exception to the Brady rule requiring the production of favorable evidence.Â  Chavis v. State of North Carolina, 637 F.2d 213 (4th Cir. 1980); Anderson v. State, 709 F.2d 887 (4th Cir. 1983).Â  \r\nThe common theme in Rule 29(b), Rule 5, Brady, and its progeny is that relief will be granted only if the information withheld is material.Â  The United States Supreme Court delineated the standard for determining materiality in United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 112-13 (1976):\r\n\r\nThe proper standard of materiality must reflect our overriding concern with the justice of the finding of guilt.Â  Such a finding is permissible only if supported by evidence establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  It necessarily follows that if the omitted evidence creates a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist, constitutional error has been committed.Â  This means that the omission must be evaluated in the context of the entire record.Â  If there is no reasonable doubt about guilt, whether or not the additional evidence is considered, there is no justification for a new trail.Â  On the other hand, if the verdict is already of questionable validity, additional evidence of relatively minor importance might be sufficient to create a reasonable doubt.\r\n\r\nIn the case at bar, the State relied on trial testimony of Adams as well as Johnson.Â  Arguably, Johnsonâ€™s testimony is the stronger of the two, considering that Johnson was in the car seated next to Scott during both the strangling and the stabbing.Â  Adamsâ€™ trial testimony confirmed he was outside the car when he saw Scott strangle Longino and inside the car when Longino was stabbed.Â  In addition, police recovered Adamsâ€™ blood-soaked clothes, suggesting he was in close proximity to Longino when he was stabbed.Â  Police also recovered a long knife from Scottâ€™s person.Â  That knife was consistent with Johnsonâ€™s eyewitness testimony and with the wound on Longinoâ€™s chest.\r\nThe document Scott complains the prosecution withheld does little to refute the trial testimony.Â  In the document, Adams claims he did not see the crime, but he did help drive the car and move the body.Â  In the document, Adams does not differentiate between the strangling and the stabbing.Â  While the document may diminish Adamsâ€™ credibility, it does not offer exculpatory evidence which would create a reasonable doubt as to Scottâ€™s guilt.Â  As such, if the defense was in possession of the document at trial, its only purpose would be to impeach Adamsâ€™ trial testimony.Â  Even if the jury would have given less credit to Adamsâ€™ testimony, the record taken as a whole still supports a guilty verdict.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial court denied Scottâ€™s motion for a new trial based on after-discovered evidence, in part, because the document is merely cumulative and impeaching.Â  The trial court also found the document was not the nature of evidence which would result in a different outcome in a new trial.Â  The document Scott complains of was not material either to his guilt or punishment.Â  As such, the omission of this document did not impede Scottâ€™s due process rights, nor did it deprive him of a fair trial.\r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nKITTREDGE, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Scott also argues that these documents prove Adams was offered leniency in exchange for his testimony in Scottâ€™s trial, an assertion which further belies Adamsâ€™ trial testimony. Â The document goes on to state â€œthere have been no promises, threats, coercion, and/or any other forms of duress from any law enforcement official representing Greenville County nor the State of South Carolina.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-337","title":"State v.

Jefferson, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-338\r\nSubmitted September 1, 2006 â€“ Filed September 21, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nActing Chief Attorney Joseph L. Savitz, III , of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nJohn Benjamin Aplin, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Faith Draper appeals the revocation of her probation arguing the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.Â  We affirm.[1]Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn April 2002, Draper pled guilty to grand larceny in Richland County.Â  Â Â She was sentenced to five years imprisonment, suspended upon the service of probation for five years.Â  At the time of her arrest, Draper was a resident of Lexington County.Â  Her case was transferred to Lexington county to supervise her parole.Â  Â Â \r\nSubsequently, Draper moved to Florida.Â  In June 2002, Lexington County issued an arrest warrant for Draper for violating the conditions of her probation.Â  In July 2002, Draper returned to Lexington County for a violation hearing.Â  Draper was allowed to continue probation and given permission to move to Florida.Â  The Lexington County Probation Office was handling Draperâ€™s probation case.Â  Â Â \r\nIn December 2002, Draper was again charged with violation of probation.Â  A probation revocation hearing was held on September 17, 2004, in Lexington County.Â  The circuit court found Draper willfully violated the terms of her probation and revoked two years of her active sentence.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe decision to revoke probation is in the discretion of the circuit court judge.Â \r\nState v. Williamson, 356 S.C. 507, 510, 589 S.E.2d 787, 788 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  This Courtâ€™s authority to review such a decision is confined to correcting errors of law unless the lack of legal or evidentiary basis indicates the circuit judgeâ€™s decision was arbitrary and capricious.Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDraper argues the circuit court was without jurisdiction to revoke her probation pursuant to section 24-21-450 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005).Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThis issue is not preserved for our review.Â  Admittedly, â€œ[i]ssues related to\r\nsubject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time.â€Â  State v. Laney,\r\n367 S.C. 639, 649, 627 S.E.2d 726, 732 (2006).Â  However, the issue raised by Draper does not involve subject matter jurisdiction, but rather goes to venue.Â Â  Subject matter jurisdiction is the power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.Â \r\nCoon v. Coon, 364 S.C. 563, 566, 614 S.E.2d 616, 617 (2005).Â  On the other hand, venue is the place or geographical location of trial and refers to the county where the action should be brought.Â \r\nWhaley v. CSX Transp., Inc., 362 S.C. 456, 468, 609 S.E.2d 286, 292 (2005).Â  Draperâ€™s argument involves venue because she asserts Lexington County was not the proper county, i.e. geographical location, to hold the probation revocation hearing.Â  Accordingly, this issue is not preserved because Draper failed to raise the defense of improper venue to the circuit court.Â  See \r\nHolroyd v. Requa, 361 S.C. 43, 65-66, 603 S.E.2d 417, 429 (Ct. App. 2004) (holding a defense of improper venue may be waived if not made by motion under Rule 12, SCRCP, or raised as an affirmative defense in a responsive pleading).Â  \r\nThis issue also fails on the merits.Â  First, the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction to hold a probation revocation hearing. See S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 11 (â€œThe Circuit Court shall be a general trial court with original jurisdiction\r\nin civil and criminal cases, except those cases in which exclusive jurisdiction shall be given to inferior courts, and shall have such appellate jurisdiction as provided by law.â€).Â  \r\nIn addition, venue was proper in Lexington County.Â  Sections 24-21-410 through 460 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) deal with probation.Â  Under section 24-21-460, the court which imposed the probationary sentence or the court where the probation violation occurs may revoke the probation. Â State v. Carter, 298 S.C. 304, 306, 379 S.E.2d 905, 906 (1989).Â  In this case, the record indicates Draperâ€™s probation had been transferred to the Lexington County Probation Office.Â  Also, Draper was a resident of Lexington County at the time of her original arrest and at the beginning of her probation sentence.Â  Under section 24-21-460, the circuit court in Lexington County was the court where the probation violation occurred and, thus, a proper venue for handling Draperâ€™s revocation hearing. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the above, we find the circuit court had jurisdiction to revoke Draperâ€™s probation.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s decision is accordingly \r\n AFFIRMED. \r\nANDERSON, KITTREDGE, and SHORT, JJ., concur.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
