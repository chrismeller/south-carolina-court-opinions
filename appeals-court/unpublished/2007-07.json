Goode, Circuit Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-340\r\nHeard February 6, 2007 â€“ Filed July 6, 2007Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tD. Reece Williams, III, and Louis H. Lang, both of Columbia, for Appellants/Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\tRaymon E. Lark, Jr., and E. Crosby Lewis, both of Columbia, for Respondents/Appellants.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Certain intestate heirs of Walter Wise Oâ€™Neal (collectively â€œthe Oâ€™Nealsâ€) challenged a 1961 deed granting 100 acres of property to Unita Pearson, alleging the deed was forged.Â  The case was first submitted to a jury, which answered the questions set forth in a special verdict form.Â  The trial court then considered the equitable issues and upheld the deed.Â  Pearson and the Oâ€™Neals both appeal.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nBefore his death, Walter Wise Oâ€™Neal (Father) owned over two hundred acres of land in Fairfield County.Â  He had nine children.Â  He and some of his children lived on the land in a home the family called the â€œBig House.â€Â  Sometime after his wifeâ€™s death, he moved in with his daughter, Unita Pearson.Â  Pearson filled the role of matriarch in the family.Â \r\n \r\nBeginning in 1961, Father deeded one-acre tracts to his children.Â  Most of the children built houses on the tracts.Â  Also in 1961, Father allegedly conveyed 100 acres of his land to Pearson.Â  The deed appears to be properly witnessed and notarized.Â  Pearson testified Father gave her the executed deed, but she did not see him sign it.Â  According to Pearson, Father told her to take the deed and record it.Â  She placed the unrecorded deed in a trunk in her home.Â  She did not record the deed until August 9, 1969. \r\n \r\nIn 1964, Father had a stroke.Â  Pearson subsequently became Fatherâ€™s primary caregiver; while the other children often brought him food and spent time with him.Â  Father died intestate in 1968.Â \r\n \r\nPearson handled the family affairs after Father died.Â  She paid all of the property taxes and leased hunting rights to the land.Â  However, testimony also indicates the other children would give her money to help pay the property taxes when the revenue from leasing hunting rights did not cover the tax bill.Â  \r\n \r\nIn the fall of 1999, Leon Thompson, a surveyor, found the deed in the Fairfield County courthouse and informed George Oâ€™Neal, another of Fatherâ€™s children, of the deedâ€™s existence.Â  George and his son went to an attorney, who recommended hiring a handwriting expert.Â  As a result, they hired Marvin H. Dawson, Jr. to examine the deed.Â  Dawson issued a report, opining the signature on the deed was not Fatherâ€™s and Pearson could not be eliminated as the person who signed Fatherâ€™s name.Â  After receiving more samples, he contended Pearson signed Fatherâ€™s name on the deed.[1]Â  \r\n \r\nIn early 2001, Pearson sold timber from the 100 acre tract for $222,203.00.Â  The Oâ€™Neals filed the present action on April 19, 2001.Â  They later obtained a temporary injunction, restraining Pearson from using any of the remaining proceeds of the timber sale.Â \r\n \r\nThe Oâ€™Neals amended their complaint twice.Â  The second amended complaint alleged Father did not sign the deed and that Pearson forged his signature.Â  As a result, the Oâ€™Neals sought to set aside the deed, damages for fraud, an accounting of all funds generated from Pearsonâ€™s use of the 100-acre tract, a constructive trust over the remaining funds, a judicial partition of the 100-acre tract, and a partition of all of the land owned by Father at his death.Â  The Oâ€™Neals and Pearson later stipulated to the partition of the remaining land.Â \r\n \r\nPearsonâ€™s answer to the Second Amended Complaint denied the forgery allegation and set up affirmative defenses of the statute of limitations, laches, estoppel, waiver, adverse possession, and presumption of a grant.Â  On March 17, 2004, Pearson was found to suffer from the early stages of Alzheimerâ€™s disease.Â  Consequently, she was unable to assist with her defense and her son was appointed as her guardian ad litem.Â  \r\n \r\nThe legal and equitable issues were bifurcated; Pearson and the Oâ€™Neals first tried the issues of forgery and fraud before a jury.Â  The Oâ€™Neals explained they would prove Father did not sign the deed and Pearson forged the deed.Â  Several family members testified, as did Dawson.Â  In addition, Pearsonâ€™s deposition testimony was read into the record.Â \r\n \r\nAfter all the evidence was presented, the Oâ€™Neals and Pearson agreed to a jury verdict form, which reads, in pertinent part:\r\n \r\n\r\n\t1. Did Walter Wise Oâ€™Neal sign the deed to the 100 acres in question?\r\n\t___ Yes. If you answer yes, stop.\r\n\t___ No. If you answer no, go to question 2.\r\n\t2. Did Defendant Unita Pearson commit forgery by signing the deed to the 100 acres in question?\r\n\t___ Yes. If you answer yes, go to question 3.\r\n\t___ No. If you answer no, stop.\r\n\t3. Did Defendant Unita Pearson commit fraud against Plaintiffs?\r\n\t___ Yes. If you answer yes, go to question 4.\r\n\t___ No. If you answer no, go to question 5.\r\n\t4. If you answered yes to either question 2, question 3, \r\n\tor questions 2 and 3, then please answer the following question: what is the total amount of \r\n\tactual damages from Defendant Unita Pearson to which Plaintiffs are entitled as a result of their\r\n\tforgery, fraud, or forgery and fraud claims?\r\n\t. . . .\r\n\r\nIn its jury instructions, the trial court explained the jury would decide the issues of fraud and forgery.Â  The jury deliberated and returned a verdict, checking â€œNoâ€ on question 1 and â€œNoâ€ on question 2 of the verdict form.Â  As instructed, the jury stopped after finding Pearson did not forge the deed by signing it.Â \r\n \r\nPearson moved for judgment not withstanding the verdict (JNOV), arguing the trial court should grant her a judgment based on adverse possession or the presumption of a grant.Â  After the Oâ€™Neals filed a return, the trial judge held a hearing and subsequently entered an order denying the motion and holding the jury â€œeffectively found that there was sufficient evidence indicating [Pearson] had not established . . . its affirmative defenses . . . .â€Â  Additionally, the trial judge held â€œthe legal issues . . . are now concluded . . . . The equitable defenses will remain active pending resolution of the equitable claims and defenses in this case.â€Â  Pearson filed a notice of appeal from that order.Â  The appeal was held in abeyance while the equitable issues were considered by the trial judge.Â \r\n \r\nAfter a hearing on the equitable issues, the trial judge entered an order upholding the deed, finding the jury had concluded no forgery had taken place.Â  The judge also held the doctrine of laches barred the Oâ€™Nealsâ€™ action.Â  The court subsequently denied the Oâ€™Nealsâ€™ motion to alter or amend the judgment.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal, the Oâ€™Neals argue the trial court erred in denying their claims of setting aside a deed, an accounting, a constructive trust, and partition.Â  These are all equitable actions.Â  See Â Bullard v. Crawley, 294 S.C. 276, 278, 363 S.E.2d 897, 898&nbsp;(1987) (stating action to set aside a deed is in equity); Laughon v. Oâ€™Braitis, 360 S.C. 520, 524, 602 S.E.2d 108, 110&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004) (stating actions seeking an accounting and partition are equitable);Â  Doe v. Roe, 323 S.C. 445, 448, 475 S.E.2d 783, 784&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996) stating action to declare a constructive trust is in equity).Â  In an equitable action, the appellate court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Townes Assocs. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  â€œ[W]hen issues common to both legal and equitable claims are to be tried in a single proceeding, legal issues are to be determined first, and the findings of the jury are binding on the sitting judge, as trier of the equitable claims.â€Â  Johnson v. South Carolina Nat. Bank, 292 S.C. 51, 55, 354 S.E.2d 895, 897&nbsp;(1987).Â  \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Oâ€™Neals argue the trial judge erred in interpreting the juryâ€™s verdict and applying it to preclude equitable relief.Â  Specifically, the Oâ€™Neals contend the juryâ€™s finding that Father did not sign the deed implies the deed was forged and, therefore, void.Â  We disagree.[2]\r\nInitially, we hold the Oâ€™Neals waived this argument by agreeing to submit the issue of forgery to the jury and agreeing to the jury form.Â  When a verdict is objectionable as to form, the party who desires to complain should call that fact to the courtâ€™s attention when the verdict is published. Â If the party fails to do so, the right to complain is waived.Â  Bensch v. Davidson, 354 S.C. 173, 179, 580 S.E.2d 128, 131&nbsp;(2003).\r\nIn this case, the trial judge submitted the issue of forgery to the jury.Â  The Oâ€™Neals did not object to this portion of the jury charge.Â  Further, the verdict form, to which the Oâ€™Neals agreed, informed the jury to stop if it found Pearson did not forge the deed.Â  Under the terms of the verdict form, only if the jury answered â€œYesâ€ to the question of whether Pearson forged the deed could the jury make a finding of forgery.Â  Accordingly, the Oâ€™Neals waived their right to establish forgery by some other theory.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Oâ€™Neals are incorrect in their proposition that they proved forgery by showing Father did not sign the deed.Â  Forgery is defined as: â€œThe false making or the material altering of a document with the intent to defraud.Â  A signature of a person that is made without the personâ€™s consent and without the person otherwise authorizing it.â€ Â Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary (6th ed. 1990).Â  When a deed is valid and regular on its face, it is presumed to be valid in all respects. Â Davis v. Monteith, 289 S.C. 176, 182, 345 S.E.2d 724, 727 (1986). Â â€œWhere a grantorâ€™s signature is placed on the instrument by the hand of another, the grantor presumptively adopts this signature as his or her own absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.â€Â  26A C.J.S. Deeds Â§385 (2001); see also Thompson v. Shell Western E &amp; P Inc., 607 So.2d 37, 40 (Miss. 1992) (expressing the same rule); Guthrie v. Gaskins, 155 S.E. 185, 187 (Ga. 1930) (holding a presumption that a grantor authorized the signing of a deed arises when the deed is properly witnessed and acknowledged).\r\nThe Oâ€™Neals rely on two South Carolina cases to support their proposition that they only needed to prove Father did not sign the deed: Barrett v. Miller, 283 S.C. 262, 321 S.E.2d 198 (Ct. App. 1984) and Kirven v. Lawrence, 244 S.C. 572, 137 S.E.2d 764 (1964).Â  We find their reliance on these cases misplaced.\r\nIn Barrett v. Miller, Barrett sued a church to set aside a deed to the church of a one-acre tract of land on the grounds that the deed was a forgery. Â The parties agreed to submit the issue of whether Barrett signed the deed to a jury.Â  In addition, the parties agreed that, if the jury found for Barrett, the issue of further relief would be decided by the judge.Â  \r\n \r\nThe jury found for Barrett, and the judge referred the remaining issues to a master.Â  The master found Barrett had been unjustly enriched because the church constructed a building on the premises.Â  This court reversed the masterâ€™s finding with respect to damages, holding the master erred in awarding damages greater than the increased value of the property as a result of the churchâ€™s construction.Â  Further, this court found equitable relief was improper because the church could use statutory law allowing a party to recover for good faith improvements made to real property which is later adjudicated to belong to another party.Â  Barrett, at 264, 321 S.E.2d at 199.Â  Frankly, we fail to see any possible application of Barrett to the facts of this case. \r\n\r\nIn Kirven v. Lawrence, the heirs of a grantor sued the heirs of a grantee to set aside a conveyance.Â  The parties submitted the question of whether the grantor lacked the sufficient mental capacity to execute the deed to the jury.Â  The jury found for the heirs of the grantor.Â  After the supreme court reinstated the verdict, which had been set aside by the master, the heirs of the grantee sought to amend their answer to allege several affirmative defenses, including restoration of the mortgage status existing at the time of the transfer of the deed. \r\n \r\nOur Supreme Court affirmed the trial judgeâ€™s decision to allow the amendment.Â  In so holding, the court explained the doctrine of restoration: â€œRestoration of the status quo is required of one seeking judicial cancellation of an instrument. . . .â€Â  Kirven, 244 S.C. at 579, 137 S.E.2d at 767 (citations and internal quotations omitted).Â  The Oâ€™Neals point to this language to support their position.Â  Again, we see no application of Kirven to the present case.Â  \r\n \r\nNo where in either of those cases did the court make any holding that could be interpreted to mean that the challengers to a deed need only prove that the grantor did not sign the deed himself.Â  The Oâ€™Neals are mistaken in their assertion that by finding Father did not sign the deed, the jury found that they had proved that the deed was forged.Â  The Oâ€™Neals are also mistaken in their contention that they should prevail because Pearson did not allege that the deed was signed by someone else with Fatherâ€™s authorization.Â  Pearson did not bear the burden of proof on that issue.Â  As the challengers to the deed, the Oâ€™Neals had the burden of proving that the deed was forged.Â  This burden included not only proving that Father did not sign the deed, but also proving by clear and convincing evidence that it was signed by someone else without Fatherâ€™s authorization.Â  We find the trial judge correctly held the Oâ€™Neals failed to carry their burden to prove that the deed was a forgery.Â  Thus, we hold the trial judge did not err in denying their claims for equitable relief including setting aside the deed.Â  \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the Oâ€™Neals waived their right to challenge the trial judgeâ€™s interpretation and application of the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  Alternatively, we reject the Oâ€™Nealsâ€™ contention they proved forgery by showing Father did not sign the deed.Â  A party seeking to invalidate a deed for an alleged forgery bears the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, the grantorâ€™s signature is unauthorized.Â  Accordingly, the trial judgeâ€™s decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.[3]\r\nHUFF, BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ. concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Oâ€™Neals also provided Dawson with a copy of deed dated June 10, 1964 granting Thomas and Louise Oâ€™Neal one acre, which was witnessed by the same individuals as the Pearson deed.Â  The Oâ€™Neals contended Pearson had signed that deed also.Â  Dawson agreed with that contention.Â  The Oâ€™Neals however did not seek to have that deed voided.Â  \r\n \r\n[2] Pearson asserts this court lacks jurisdiction because the Oâ€™Neals failed to appeal from the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  The Oâ€™Neals, however, are not directly attacking the juryâ€™s verdict on appeal.Â  Instead, they charge error in the trial judgeâ€™s interpretation and application of the verdict and the trial judgeâ€™s decision that laches bars equitable relief.Â  The alleged errors occurred, if at all, within the trial judgeâ€™s order denying equitable relief.Â  The Oâ€™Neals timely appealed from the orders denying their equitable claims.Â  Accordingly, we find this court has jurisdiction to consider the Oâ€™Nealsâ€™ appeal.Â  \r\n \r\n[3]As we find the trial court did not err in refusing to set aside the deed because the Oâ€™Neals failed to carry their burden of proving the deed was a forgery, we need not address Pearson and the Oâ€™Nealsâ€™ remaining arguments.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling appellate court need not review remaining issues when disposition of prior issues are dispositive).Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-346","title":"State v.

Â Benchmark failed to answer the complaint and went into default.Â  BPD obtained separate judgments in its favor on each of the claims.Â  Benchmark appeals, arguing the master erred in denying its motion to be relieved from the default judgment and in awarding an excessive amount of attorneyâ€™s fees to BPD.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn March 17, 2005, BPD signed an Architectural and Construction Agreement to design, remodel, furnish, and equip a bank branch facility owned by Benchmark in Greenville, South Carolina.Â  The agreement provided BPD would receive minimum compensation of $24,000.00 for architectural services and at least $24,000.00 for construction services.Â \r\n \r\nOn October 14, 2005, BPD filed a Notice of Mechanicâ€™s Lien upon the property for $16,607.09 for labor performed and materials provided to Benchmark.Â  The notice was accompanied by a Verification of Statement of Account signed by BPDâ€™s president.Â  The Notice of Mechanicâ€™s Lien and the Verification of Statement of Account were served upon the registered agent for Benchmark, Charles Smith, on October 13, 2005.Â \r\n \r\nSmith gave the documentation to C.D. Candler, the president of Benchmark.Â  Candler met with his attorney regarding the mechanicâ€™s lien and was reportedly instructed that he did not need to take action unless a lawsuit was filed to foreclose the lien.Â \r\n \r\nOn November 29, 2005, BPD filed a summons and complaint against Benchmark asserting claims for foreclosure of the mechanicâ€™s lien and breach of contract.Â  BPD sought $16,607.09 for the lien, plus interest, attorneyâ€™s fees, and costs.Â  On the breach of contract claim, BPD sought $61,170.70, plus interest and costs.Â  The same day, BPD also filed a lis pendens.Â  Â Â \r\nAccording to an Affidavit of Service, Smith was served with these pleadings on December 10, 2005.Â  In his own affidavit, Smith admitted being served on December 10th, but stated that he thought the documents were â€œthe same as the original mechanic[â€™]s lien,â€ so he left a copy of them on Candlerâ€™s desk.Â  At that time, both Candler and Benchmarkâ€™s attorney were out of the country.Â  On January 13, 2006, having received no answer to the pleadings or request for an extension of time, BPD filed an affidavit of default.Â  Â Â \r\nThe Honorable G.E. Welmaker filed an Order of Default and Order of Reference on February 13, 2006, finding Benchmark had not answered or otherwise filed a response to the pleadings and therefore was in default. Judge Welmaker separated the mechanicâ€™s lien and the breach of contract actions and referred the mechanicâ€™s lien claim to the Master-In-Equity for Greenville County â€œto make findings of fact and conclusions of law; dispose of any and all issues and enter a final judgment in the case; order a judicial sale on any day . . . ; [and] hear and dispose of any issues after sale or judgment . . . .â€Â  In the same order, Judge Welmaker stated the claim for breach of contract â€œhas been or will be resolved by the issuance of a default judgment.â€Â  Thereafter, Judge Welmaker filed a separate Order for Judgment by Default on March 1, 2006, granting BPD a default judgment against Benchmark for $61,170.70 for its breach of contract claim.Â \r\n \r\nOn March 1, 2006, BPDâ€™s attorney mailed a Notice of Hearing to Benchmark advising it that a hearing regarding the mechanicâ€™s lien claim had been scheduled before the Master-In-Equity on March 23, 2006, following which a final judgment would be issued.Â  After receiving this notice, Candler searched his office and discovered the 2005 pleadings on his desk.Â  Â Â \r\nOn March 21, 2006, Benchmark filed a â€œMotion to Set Aside Default Pursuant to Rule[s] 55 and 60 of SCRCPâ€ asking the court to set aside the default judgment â€œon the grounds that the Defendant[â€™]s neglect in [a]nswering the Complaint is excusable; that the Complaint does not properly and adequately verify the damages by verified statement of account; [and] even if the statement of account is proper the damages verified are patently inconsistent on their face and the [D]efendant has a meritorious defense.â€Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nThe master held a hearing regarding the claim for foreclosure of the mechanicâ€™s lien as scheduled on March 23, 2006.Â  At the start of the hearing, BPDâ€™s counsel was made aware, for the first time, of Benchmarkâ€™s motion regarding the default and stated she had not been served with a copy of it.Â  Benchmarkâ€™s attorney noted the motion was â€œon its wayâ€ to BPD.Â  The master stated the hearing would go on as scheduled, explaining, â€œ[A]t this point I donâ€™t have any basis to do anything other than proceed.â€Â Â  Benchmarkâ€™s attorney expressly consented to continuation of the hearing on the foreclosure.Â  The parties thereafter focused solely on the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees that should be awarded on the mechanicâ€™s lien action, with Benchmarkâ€™s attorney questioning BPDâ€™s attorney as to the basis for the amount claimed.Â  Benchmark did not specifically dispute any of the other amounts sought in the mechanicâ€™s lien action at the hearing.Â  Â \r\nThe master filed a Decree for Foreclosure of Mechanicâ€™s Lien on March 28, 2006, awarding $16,607.09 for foreclosure of the lien, $4,000.00 for attorneyâ€™s fees, plus interest and costs, for a total judgment of $21,974.64.Â  The master noted the default judgment obtained for breach of contract was â€œa separate debt owed by the Defendant, completely unrelated to the debt established herein, as secured by a mechanicâ€™s lien.â€[2]Â   \r\nOn April 6, 2006, the master held a hearing on Benchmarkâ€™s motion regarding the default.Â  The master initially discussed the fact that Benchmarkâ€™s motion was made pursuant to both Rule 55 and Rule 60 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, but the master stated he believed Rule 60 would then be applicable â€œsince the default was already entered.â€Â  None of the parties objected to the application of Rule 60, and they proceeded to argue whether â€œexcusable neglectâ€ had been established as required under the rule.[3]Â   \r\nIn early May 2006, the master denied Benchmarkâ€™s motion for relief from the default judgment, finding Benchmark had not established â€œexcusable neglectâ€ under Rule 60(b), SCRCP.Â  Prior to this ruling, Benchmark had filed on April 27, 2006 a motion to alter or amend the judgment for foreclosure of the mechanicâ€™s lien, arguing the award of $4,000.00 for attorneyâ€™s fees was excessive.Â  The master denied this motion on May 23, 2006, finding the amount of the attorneyâ€™s fees awarded was appropriate.Â \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Default Judgment\r\nOn appeal, Benchmark argues the master â€œabused [his] discretion in not setting aside the defaultâ€ because Benchmark demonstrated it acted promptly upon receiving notice of the default judgment, its neglect was excusable, and it had a meritorious defense.[4] Â \r\nRule 60(b)\r\nâ€œThe proper procedure for challenging a default judgment is to move the trial court to set aside the judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b), SCRCP.â€Â  Winesett v. Winesett,&nbsp;287 S.C. 332, 334, 338 S.E.2d 340, 341&nbsp;(1985).Â  Rule 60(b)(1) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure permits a court to relieve a party from a final judgment upon a finding of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.Â  Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP.Â  The movant must also show a meritorious defense.Â  Tri-County Ice &amp; Fuel Co. v. Palmetto Ice Co., 303 S.C. 237, 242, 399 S.E.2d 779, 782 (1990).Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nâ€œWhether to grant or deny a motion under Rule 60(b) lies within the sound discretion of the judge.â€Â  BB &amp; T v. Taylor,&nbsp;369 S.C. 548, 551, 633 S.E.2d 501, 502&nbsp;(2006).Â  â€œOur standard of review, therefore, is limited to determining whether there was an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Id. at 551, 633 S.E.2d at 502-03.Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion arises where the judge issuing the order was controlled by an error of law or where the order is based on factual conclusions that are without evidentiary support.â€Â  Id. at 551, 633 S.E.2d at 503.\r\nA party seeking to set aside a judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b) has the burden of presenting evidence to support the claim for relief.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 304 S.C. 65, 67, 403 S.E.2d 127, 129 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  In this case, Benchmark contends the judgment should be set aside for excusable neglect.Â  â€œExcusable neglectâ€ is generally defined as follows:\r\n\r\n\tA failure â€“ which the law will excuse â€“ to take some proper step at the proper time (esp. in neglecting to answer a lawsuit) not because of the partyâ€™s own carelessness, inattention, or willful disregard of the courtâ€™s process, but because of some unexpected or unavoidable hindrance or accident . . . .\r\n\r\nBlackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1055 (7th ed. 1999).Â   \r\nIn this case, the registered agent for Benchmark, Charles Smith, was served with the pleadings for foreclosure of the mechanicâ€™s lien on or about December 10, 2005.Â  Smith incorrectly assumed these documents were the same as the original Notice of Mechanicâ€™s Lien, and he placed the pleadings on Candlerâ€™s desk.Â  The pleadings remained on Candlerâ€™s desk until he discovered them several months later in March 2006, well after the time allowed for a responsive pleading.Â  Benchmarkâ€™s explanation for its failure to take any action on the pleadings is that Smith did not recognize these were new pleadings; Candler, Benchmarkâ€™s president, was on his honeymoon in South America in December 2005; and Benchmarkâ€™s attorney was also out of the country for part of this time.Â \r\n \r\nIn denying the motion to set aside the default judgment, the master found â€œ[t]he registered agent failed to take notice of the language in the [s]ummons which alerted him to the nature of the proceedings and the results of inaction.â€Â  The master determined the registered agentâ€™s â€œalleged mistake in believing the lis pendens, summons and complaint to be the same as the mechanicâ€™s lien does not amount to excusable neglect, as â€˜[l]ack of familiarity with legal proceedings is unacceptable and the court will not hold a layman to any lesser standard than is applied to an attorney,â€™â€ quoting Hill v. Dotts, 345 S.C. 304, 310, 547 S.E.2d 894, 897 (Ct. App. 2001).[5]Â  Â Â \r\nThe master further noted that â€œ[c]onfusion over litigation does not, by itself, warrant relief from default.â€Â  The master stated BPD â€œwould be prejudiced by the delay in the sale and lost expense attributed to the advertisement if the Court were to set aside the default judgment.â€Â  The master concluded â€œthat [Benchmark] has failed to show excusable neglect as required under Rule 60(b) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.â€Â  \r\n \r\nWe find there is evidence to support the masterâ€™s determination and hold the master properly exercised his discretion in not setting aside the default judgment based on excusable neglect.Â  In this case, Benchmark had a duty to monitor the progress of its case, especially since it was aware that a Notice of Mechanicâ€™s Lien had already been filed and it was on notice to expect an action to foreclose the lien.Â  The registered agentâ€™s failure to recognize and appreciate the significance of the pleadings seeking foreclosure of the lien and his mistaken belief those pleadings were additional copies of the original Notice of Mechanicâ€™s Lien is not the type of neglect that is excusable under Rule 60(b).Â  \r\n \r\nBased on the foregoing, we affirm the masterâ€™s ruling upholding the default judgment.Â  See Stewart v. Floyd, 274 S.C. 437, 440-41, 265 S.E.2d 254, 255-56 (1980) (affirming the trial courtâ€™s refusal to set aside a default judgment where the defendant, a practicing physician, contended he received two sets of summons and complaints that were so similar that it constituted excusable neglect for him to conclude the second set had been taken care of by the fact that he had given the first set to his attorneys; our supreme court noted that, in this case, the defendantâ€™s attorneys and his malpractice carrier â€œwere alert to the fact that a second action would probably be forthcomingâ€); DeNault v. Holloway Builders, Inc., 271 S.C. 468, 470, 248 S.E.2d 265, 266 (1978) (holding a corporate presidentâ€™s confusion over receiving two complaints in the same week and his mistaken assumption that service had occurred the same day, thus resulting in the late service of an answer, did not constitute excusable neglect to set aside a default judgment, the court stating â€œ[i]n such situations, neglect is present but not excusable neglect entitling a party to relief from a default judgmentâ€); cf. Mitchell Supply Co. v. Gaffney, 297 S.C. 160, 375 S.E.2d 321&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1988) (holding the debtors were not entitled to relief from a default judgment on the basis their attorney failed to properly review the pleadings that were delivered to him; the attorneyâ€™s neglect was attributable to the client and did not constitute the type of neglect that was excusable under Rule 60(b), SCRCP).\r\nDamages Hearing\r\nBenchmark further argues the master â€œerred in not setting aside the judgment and requiring a damage[s] hearing, the error being that there was no verified statement of account, the claim was unliquidated as a matter of law[,] and the verified pleadings failed to set forth damages in a manner that could be readily ascertained.â€Â  Benchmark argues the amount requested was â€œa sum which can only be made certain by computation.â€Â Â Â \r\n \r\nIn establishing the amount due under the mechanicâ€™s lien, the master, citing Rule 55, SCRCP, observed, â€œThe present case involved liquidated damages, and Plaintiff properly and adequately verified those damages through a verified statement of account. . . .Â  A hearing on the damages claimed by Plaintiff is not necessary as the Lis Pendens, Summons and Complaint were properly and adequately verified by a verified statement of account.â€Â \r\n \r\nDamages are said to be liquidated where â€œthe sum is certain or capable of being reduced to certainty based on a mathematical calculation previously agreed to by the parties.â€Â  Vaughn Dev., Inc. v. Westvaco Dev. Corp., Â 372 S.C. 576, 579-580, 642 S.E.2d 757, 759&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2007).\r\n\r\n\tRule 55(b)(1), SCRCP provides as follows:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tWhen the claim of a party seeking judgment by default is for a liquidated amount, a sum certain or a sum which can by computation be made certain, the judge, upon motion or application of the party seeking default, and upon affidavit of the amount due, shall enter judgment for that amount and costs against the party against whom judgment by default is sought, if that party has been defaulted for failure to appear . . . .Â  A verified pleading may be used in lieu of an affidavit when the pleading contains information sufficient to determine or compute the sum certain. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAt the hearing on March 23, 2006, the master heard testimony regarding the mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  Counsel for both BPD and Benchmark were in attendance.Â  Benchmarkâ€™s counsel examined BPDâ€™s counsel regarding her claimed attorneyâ€™s fees, but did not dispute any of the other amounts BPD had requested.Â  Thus, Benchmarkâ€™s counsel had an opportunity to dispute the requested damages prior to the filing of the order foreclosing the mechanicâ€™s lien on March 28, 2006.Â  Benchmarkâ€™s argument that the default judgment should be set aside because of the lack of a damages hearing is, therefore, without merit.\r\nAdditionally, the master did not err in issuing a default judgment because the pleadings were, in any event, verified and requested a definite amount.Â  BPDâ€™s complaint included a specific demand for $16,607.00, plus prejudgment interest, attorneyâ€™s fees, and costs.Â  The complaint incorporated by reference the Notice of Mechanicâ€™s Lien, which included a description of Benchmarkâ€™s property.Â  The pleadings included a Verification of Statement of Account signed by BPDâ€™s president stating the complaint and allegations were true to the best of his knowledge.Â  They also included a copy of the partiesâ€™ agreement, which set forth the guidelines for minimum compensation.Â  The computations may be difficult, but the pleadings provided guidance and verification.Â Â \r\n \r\nViewed together, these documents satisfy the verification requirements for a mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  See Taylor Freezer Sales Co. v. Bachman, 285 S.C. 292, 296, 329 S.E.2d 1, 3 (Ct. App. 1985) (observing that, in determining if a statement of account is satisfactory, the complaint, statement of account, and verification must be considered together); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-90 (2007) (noting a statement of account should contain â€œa just and true account of the amount due [], with all just credits given, together with a description of the property intended to be covered by the lien sufficiently accurate for identification, with the name of the owner of the property, if known, which certificate shall be subscribed and sworn to by the person claiming the lien or by someone [o]n his behalfâ€); see also Rule 9(i), SCRCP (regarding verifications of accounts, stating â€œ[i]n an action on an account the pleader shall attach a verified copy of the account to the pleading, or if the items of the account are set forth in the pleading, it must be verifiedâ€).\r\nIn cases where the amount of damages is not certain, â€œthe court may conduct such hearing or order such references as it deems necessary and proper . . . .â€Â  Rule 55(b)(2), SCRCP (emphasis added).Â  Thus, if the master did not believe these were liquidated damages, the master had the discretion to explore these amounts or to examine the parties further, but it is clear from the record that the master did not find it necessary to go beyond what the parties addressed at the hearing, namely, the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We conclude the parties did have an opportunity to examine BPD regarding the amounts requested at the scheduled hearing and, further, that a hearing was not required in any case as the amounts sought were verified and ascertainable.Â  Accordingly, the default judgment for the mechanicâ€™s lien should not be set aside.\r\nII.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nBenchmark next argues the master erred in granting the full amount of attorneyâ€™s fees requested by BPDâ€™s counsel in the mechanicâ€™s lien action because the amount was excessive.Â  Benchmark specifically asserts that some of the time billed pertained to the breach of contract claim, for which attorneyâ€™s fees are not recoverable.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nUnder South Carolina law, â€œ[t]he costs which may arise in enforcing or defending against the [mechanicâ€™s] lien under this chapter, including a reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee, may be recovered by the prevailing party.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10(a) (2007).Â  â€œThe fee must be determined by the court in which the action is brought but the fee and the court costs may not exceed the amount of the lien.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nâ€œThe determination as to the amount of attorney fees which should be awarded under the mechanicâ€™s lien statute is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and its decision will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Seckinger v. Vessel Excalibur,&nbsp;326 S.C. 382, 386, 483 S.E.2d 775, 777&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997).\r\nIn determining a reasonable fee, a court should consider the following six factors:Â  â€œ1) nature, extent, and difficulty of the legal services rendered; 2) time and labor devoted to the case; 3) professional standing of counsel; 4) contingency of compensation; 5) fee customarily charged in the locality for similar services; and 6) beneficial results obtained.â€Â  Blumberg v. Nealco, Inc.,&nbsp;310 S.C. 492, 494, 427 S.E.2d 659, 660&nbsp;(1993); see also Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991) (addressing the factors to be considered in determining a reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee).\r\nBPDâ€™s attorney, Sara Hutchins, submitted an affidavit requesting $4,000.00 as a reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee for the mechanicâ€™s lien claim.Â  Counsel stated she worked twenty-four hours on the case at a rate of $150.00 per hour, and she anticipated an additional three hours would be necessary following the hearing.Â  She also itemized costs of $850.00 incurred in the action.Â \r\n \r\nAt the hearing on damages for the mechanicâ€™s lien, Benchmarkâ€™s attorney questioned Hutchins about the time she devoted solely to the mechanicâ€™s lien claim.Â  Hutchins explained that she prepared one complaint that included claims for both foreclosure of the mechanicâ€™s lien and breach of contract, and one lis pendens.Â  She stated any time that would indirectly be attributable to the breach of contract claim was minimal, however, as it ended in a default judgment.Â  Benchmark raised no objection to the amount of costs itemized in the affidavit.[6]Â  \r\n \r\nIn awarding BPD attorneyâ€™s fees and again in addressing Benchmarkâ€™s motion to alter or amend, the master expressly considered the relevant factors in Blumberg before finding $4,000.00 was â€œa reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee for the Plaintiffâ€™s attorney for services performed and anticipated to be performed until final adjudication of the within action.â€Â  In making the award, the master noted the fee covered â€œthe time and labor devoted to the case, including reviewing the various loan documents, performing the title search, preparing, filing and serving the Mechanicâ€™s Lien and the pleadings herein[,]â€ as well as â€œpreparing for the hearing, including preparing this decree and other documents requested by the Court, attending the hearing, preparing for and attending the sale, and preparing any post-sale documents requested by the Court.â€Â  \r\n \r\nTestimony at the hearing, Hutchinsâ€™s affidavit, Benchmarkâ€™s continued intertwining of the two claims, and the number of pleadings, motions, and hearings involved, all support the masterâ€™s decision to award BPD $4,000.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Accordingly, we hold the master considered the appropriate factors and did not abuse his discretion in awarding $4,000.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees to BPD.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Â At the foreclosure hearing, BPDâ€™s counsel stated the breach of contract claim was for architectural fees, whereas the mechanicâ€™s lien was for construction and contracting services provided.Â  Counsel stated the amount requested for the mechanicâ€™s lien was â€œnot included in the judgment by default [BPD] received on the breach of contract issue.â€Â \r\n \r\n[3]Â  See Fickling v. City of Charleston, 372 S.C. 597, 601, 643 S.E.2d 110, 112&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2007) (stating a trial courtâ€™s ruling on an issue becomes the law of the case where the appellant fails to take exception to it both before the trial court and on appeal). \r\n \r\n[4]Â  The notice of appeal challenges three orders issued by the master regarding BPDâ€™s claim for foreclosure of a mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  To the extent Benchmarkâ€™s brief can be construed as raising issues regarding the default judgment for breach of contract, we note these issues are not properly before us.Â  The circuit court, in a separate order, entered the default judgment for the breach of contract claim.Â  The only claim referred to the master was for foreclosure of the mechanicâ€™s lien, and that is the only matter addressed in the masterâ€™s orders.Â  Accordingly, we make no determination regarding the breach of contract claim.\r\n[5] Â In Hill, the defendantâ€™s mother sent a letter to the plaintiff on the defendantâ€™s behalf after the defendant received the complaint, but the defendant did not serve a responsive pleading.Â  Id. at 306-07, 547 S.E.2d at 895.Â  We held the defendantâ€™s â€œfailure to understand the legal process is [not] a sufficient reason to excuse his tardy reply.â€Â  Id. at 310, 547 S.E.2d at 897.Â  We noted a party has a duty to monitor the progress of his case and to timely respond when duly served with a summons and complaint.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\n[6]Â  To the extent Benchmark attempts on appeal to contest the amount of costs awarded and to argue the total included costs that were not recoverable, no issue is preserved in this regard.Â  See, e.g., Washington v. Whitaker, 317 S.C. 108, 114, 451 S.E.2d 894, 898&nbsp;(1994) (â€œ[I]t is well settled that a contemporaneous objection must be made to preserve an argument for appellate review.â€). \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-348","title":"Eison v.

Thames, Office of the Attorney General, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Following his conviction and subsequent direct appeal, Eison filed his initial petition for writ of habeas corpus on May 23, 1996.Â  This petition was construed by the circuit court to be a PCR.Â  Following a hearing, the circuit court dismissed the action.Â  Eison appealed the dismissal to the Supreme Court, but his petition for writ of certiorari was denied onÂ  December 29, 1998.\r\n \r\nEison then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the South Carolina Supreme Court on January 5, 1999.Â  His petition was denied on February 5, 1999.Â  Eison then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal court on March 11, 1999.Â  That petition was dismissed by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on June 6, 2000.Â  Eison then filed another petition for writ of habeas corpus in the circuit court on October 11, 2000.Â  A PCR hearing was held, and Eisonâ€™s petition was dismissed on June 26, 2001.Â  Eison appealed the dismissal to the Supreme Court, but his petition for writ of certiorari was denied on February 21, 2003.Â \r\n \r\nEison filed the instant petition for writ of habeas corpus on February 20, 2004, in the circuit court.Â  In this petition, Eison contended he had been â€œdenied due process of law in violation of the federal constitutionâ€™s fourteenth amendment by the state knowingly presenting false testimony; failing to disclose exculpatory, impeachment, and mitigating information.â€Â  By order filed March 14, 2005, the circuit court dismissed the petition because Eison was procedurally barred from filing a petition for writ of habeas corpus in a circuit court. The court also found that the Supreme Court was the proper place for him to file his petition for writ of habeas corpus due to the matter he alleged entitled him to relief being a matter which could have been filed in a PCR action.Â  The court went on to review the action as a PCR and found that it should be dismissed even if treated as a PCR because it wasÂ  successive and filed untimely pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-45(a).Â  This appeal follows.\r\nEison claims the circuit court erred in failing to order the State to respond to his subpoenas and discovery motion before dismissing the action.Â  He also claims the circuit court violated his procedural and substantive due process by failing to abide by established rules and procedures.Â  We affirm the circuit courtâ€™s decision pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities: Keller v. Mauney, 330 S.C. 568, 500 S.E.2d 123 (Ct. App. 1998) (holding that a person whose claim for relief could have been raised in a PCR application is procedurally barred from petitioning a circuit for a writ of habeas corpus and his only means of seeking such a writ is in the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Courtâ€); Gibson v.

Medich, all of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this action to try title, Virginia Alford argues the master in equity erred in finding Joseph Tamsberg established title to marshlands through adverse possession.Â  She also contends the master erred in (1) finding res judicata barred her claim; (2) denying her motion for a new trial; and (3) dismissing her claim for trespass.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAlford and Tamsberg are adjoining landowners.Â  Both properties consist of highlands and marshlands.Â  At issue in this case is a 150 acre tract of marshland that is, essentially, all of the marshland Tamsberg owns, which Alford claims title to.Â  Alford also claims the boundary line in the center of a canal, or ditch as it is often referred to, between the highland portion of the two properties is incorrect (Highland Dispute).Â  She alleges the boundary line should be placed on the northern side of the canal on Tamsbergâ€™s property.\r\nAlford can directly trace the title to her property back to 1839, to a deed from Thomas Butler to her relative, Thaddeus C. Skrine. Â Â Prior to 1951, Tamsbergâ€™s property consisted of two parcels of land owned by Belmont Land and Investment Company (Belmont Land).Â  In 1951 the first known survey (Belmont Survey) of the two parcels was commissioned.Â  On April 18, 1956, Belmont Land conveyed the two parcels, as shown on the 1951 Belmont Survey, to Belmont Hosiery Mills, Inc. (Belmont Hosiery).Â  \r\n \r\nIn 1961, Alford commenced an action against Belmont Hosiery, for recovery of 40 acres of marshland.Â  The parties settled the suit by Belmont Hosiery quitclaiming the disputed 40 acres to Alford.Â  The marshlands deeded to Alford were depicted on the settlement plat prepared by W.S. Gaillard.Â  After the parties reached the settlement, the trial court dismissed Alfordâ€™s claim with prejudice.Â  \r\n\r\nIn 1967, Alford commissioned Gaillard to prepare a survey of her property.Â  In 1968, Alford consolidated all her property â€œinto one deed and one plat.â€Â  The deed identified the property â€œas fully described and delineated by a plat of W.L. Gaillard, Surveyor, dated April 1967â€Â  (1967 Alford Survey).\r\n \r\nOn May 30, 1968, Belmont Hosiery conveyed the land, minus the 40 acres of marshland deeded to Alford, to Heritage Development CompanyÂ  (Heritage). Â Â By a Certificate of Merger, Heritage merged into Parkdale Mills, Inc., (Parkdale), Tamsbergâ€™s immediate predecessor.Â  On January 30, 1990, Tamsberg purchased the property from Parkdale.Â Â  For this purchase, Tamsberg had a survey prepared by Luckey Sanders (1990 Tamsberg Survey).Â  All of the surveys since 1951, including the 1967 Alford Survey, show the boundary lines of the adjoining property as depicted on the 1951 Belmont Survey prepared by Gaillard.Â  \r\n \r\nOn January 26, 2000, Alford initiated this action, seeking to quiet title to a part of Tamsbergâ€™s marshlands.Â  She also sought to quiet the boundary between the adjoining lands.Â  The case was referred to the master, and on September 14, 2000, the partiesâ€™ partially tried the case.Â  Shortly thereafter, the parties reached a settlement.Â  Alford moved to have the settlement quashed, and the master granted her motion.Â  Due to the complexity of the case, Alford received numerous extensions.Â  \r\n\r\nOn February, 14, 2002, the master concluded that because the parties disputed title to marshlands, the State of South Carolina, as presumptive owner of all tidelands, would have to be made a party to the case.Â  On January 28, 2003, Alford amended her complaint to reflect her finding of a 1797 grant from the State of South Carolina to Skrineâ€™s immediate predecessor in title, Joseph Butler (Butler Grant).Â  Essentially, Alford claimed that because she showed her title emanated from a grant from the State and Tamsberg could not trace his title back to a grant from the State, she owned all of Tamsbergâ€™s marshlands.Â  \r\n\r\na hearing on June 18 and 19, 2003, the master found the State of South Carolina had divested itself of any marshlands conveyed by the Butler Grant.Â  Therefore, the master found both Tamsberg and Alfordâ€™s claim to their respective marshes was superior to the Stateâ€™s claim.Â  Additionally, the master found the 1967 Alford Survey and the 1951 Belmont Survey both refer to the boundary line between the adjoining properties as â€œditch the line.â€ Â The master also found the unrecorded 1886 Royall Plat also placed the boundary line at the center. Â Accordingly, the master concluded that the surveys place the line in the center of the ditch.Â  Further, the master found the 1990 Tamsberg survey also described the boundary line as â€œditch on or near property line.â€Â  \r\n\r\nAs to the marshland, the master found all of the surveys were in agreement as to the boundary lines of the two properties.Â  The master found that Tamsbergâ€™s 60 year chain of title included the marshlands; however, his title could not be traced to Butler or Skrine.Â  Due to the doctrine of adverse possession, the master concluded that Tamsberg had ownership of the marsh through the presumption of a grant theory.Â  Additionally, the master found section 15-3-380 of the South Carolina Code (2005), the forty-year lapse statute, provided Tamsberg with good title.Â  Further, the master found Alford acquiesced to Tamsbergâ€™s use of the marshlands for 32 years.Â  Lastly, the master noted that res judicata barred Alfordâ€™s claim because of the previous suit with Tamsbergâ€™s predecessor in title, Belmont Hosiery.Â  \r\n\r\nAlford filed a motion under Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to alter or amend the judgment, which the master denied.Â  The master also denied Alfordâ€™s motion for a new trial based on after discovered evidence.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nNormally, an action to quiet title to property is one in equity.Â  Clark v. Hargrave, 323 S.C. 84, 86, 473 S.E.2d 474, 475 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œHowever, the character, as legal or equitable, of an action is determined by the complaint in its main purpose, the nature of the issues as raised by the pleadings . . . and the character of the relief sought under them.â€Â  Id. (citing Ins. Fin. Serv., Inc., v. S.C. Ins. Co., 271 S.C. 289, 247 S.E.2d 315 (1978).Â  \r\n \r\nAlford alleged in her complaint that Tamsberg owned no marshland and that she had superior title to his land.Â  Tamsberg, in his answer, responded that he possessed fee simple title to the marshlands and asserted adverse possession as an affirmative defense.Â  Because this action primarily involves the determination of title to real estate based on adverse possession, it is an action at law.Â  Id. at 87, 473 S.E.2d at 476 (holding an action primarily involving adverse possession can properly be characterized as an action at law). Â Additionally, a boundary dispute is an action at law.Â  Bodiford v. Spanish Oak Farms, Inc., 317 S.C. 539, 544, 455 S.E.2d 194, 197 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  â€œIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judges findings.â€Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775&nbsp;(1976).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Highland Dispute  \r\nAlford argues the master erred in placing the boundary line between the adjoining properties down the center of the ditch.Â  Alford argues the true boundary line, as depicted in the unrecorded 1886 Royall Plat, shows the boundary line is on the north side of the ditch.Â  We disagree. Â \r\nDuring the trial, Tamsberg presented Thomas Bessent, an expert in the field of land surveying.Â  Alford originally hired Bessent to resurvey the property because she questioned the boundary line between the adjoining properties.Â  Bessent testified he looked at the Belmont Survey, Alford Survey, and Tamsberg Survey, as well as the 1886 Royall Plat.Â  He then went to the property to conduct his own survey.Â  He opined the correct boundary line was the center of the ditch as depicted in the Belmont, Alford, and Tamsberg Surveys.Â  In Bessentâ€™s expert opinion, even the Royall Plat shows the boundary line as the center of the ditch.Â  He pointed out that the Royall Plat has a dashed black property line that clearly runs through the middle of the ditch.Â  At the end of that black line is the word â€œpost.â€Â  According to Bessent, the black line is marked by a post, in the center of the ditch.Â  \r\n\r\nAlford presented Steve Johnson, also as an expert in surveying.Â  He opined the boundary line was on the northern side of the ditch on Tamsbergâ€™s property.Â  He testified that he used Alfordâ€™s parol evidence to help him establish the boundary line.\r\nWe hold that the record overwhelmingly supports the masterâ€™s finding that the boundary line is in the center of the ditch.Â  The evidence shows that all of the surveys, including the 1886 Royall Plat, relied on by Alford, shows the boundary line as the center of the ditch.Â  In fact, the only evidence to the contrary is Alfordâ€™s expert, Johnson, who admitted to using Alfordâ€™s parol testimony to â€œaidâ€ the rendition of his survey.Â  Accordingly, we find the master properly concluded the true boundary line between the adjoining properties is the center of the ditch, as depicted by the various surveys.Â \r\n \r\nII.Â  Adverse Possession \r\nAlford argues the master erred in finding Tamsberg obtained title to the marsh by adverse possession.Â  Specifically, Alford contends Tamsberg cannot show his title to the marsh derives from a grant from the State of South Carolina.Â  She maintains she can trace back her chain of title to a grant from the State, but that because she did not prove actual ownership of the marshlands until this litigation the presumption was the State owned the marsh.Â  Therefore, Alford argues Tamsbergâ€™s claim to the marsh by adverse possession could not accrue against her in the short time since she has established her title.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn South Carolina, the State is the presumptive owner of all tidelands.Â  State v. Yelsen Land Co., Inc., 265 S.C. 78, 81, 216 S.E.2d 876, 878 (1975).Â  A party wishing to rebut this presumption bears the burden of showing the State â€œgranted title to such lands to their predecessors in title.â€Â  Id. (citing State v. Pinckney, 22 S.C. 484 (1885); State v. Hardee, 259 S.C. 535, 193 S.E.2d 497 (1972)).Â  In addition, the doctrine of adverse possession cannot be used against the State.Â  Davis v. Monteith, 289 S.C. 176, 179-180, 345 S.E.2d 724, 276 (1986) (citations omitted).Â  Â Â Â \r\nIn this case, the master found that on July 3, 1797, the State of South Carolina granted 325 acres of marshland to Joseph Butler, which included both Alfordâ€™s and Tamsbergâ€™s portion of the marsh.Â  Therefore, the master concluded that Alford and Tamsbergâ€™s claim to their respective parcels of marshland were superior to the Stateâ€™s claim.Â  The master also found that because Tamsbergâ€™s title to the marshlands cannot be specifically traced to the Butler Grant that, but for â€œa succession of events over the years, and many years of possession by Tamsberg and his predecessors in title, Alford would have a superior claim to Tamsbergâ€™s marshes.â€\r\nAlfordâ€™s argument rests on the faulty premise that the State held actual title to the marshlands until she proved otherwise.Â  Under Alfordâ€™s reasoning, Tamsberg could not have adversely possessed against the State and, because she has held title for such a short time, Tamsberg is unable to satisfy the elements of adverse possession against her.Â  However, as noted above, title to marshlands in South Carolina is presumptively rather than actually vested in the State.Â  Alford, through diligent research, overcame the presumption and established the State granted marshlands to her predecessor in title in 1797.Â  Therefore, Alford and her predecessors in title have held title to the marshlands since 1797 and Tamsberg and his predecessors could use the doctrine of adverse possession to claim title to the land.Â  We now turn to examine whether Tamsberg has satisfied the elements of adverse possession.\r\nIn South Carolina, when a party shows â€œactual, hostile, exclusive, and continuous possessionâ€ of land for twenty years a presumption of grant is said to exist.Â  Haithcock v. Haithcock, 123 S.C. 61, 67, 115 S.E. 727, 729 (1923).Â  In addition, to satisfy the requisite period of time â€œthe time of possession may be tacked not only by ancestors and heirs, but also between parties in privity. . . .â€Â  Getsinger v. Midlands Orthopaedic Profit Sharing Plan,&nbsp;327 S.C. 424, 430, 489 S.E.2d 223, 226&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œThis common law presumption rests upon the theory that after a long period of peaceful possession, the possessor, or those under whom the possessor hold, will be presumed to have entered upon and possessed the property under a valid grant, now lost.â€Â  S.C. Juris. Adverse Possession Â§ 10 (citation omitted).Â  \r\n \r\nThe master found Tamsberg and his predecessors for at least forty-seven years have maintained, improved, and repaired the existing dikes which encompassed impoundments in the marshland. Â Â Tamsberg expended at least $100,000 on these activities since he purchased the property in 1990.Â  The master also found Tamsberg protected the marsh through caretakers he hired and with â€œno trespassingâ€ signs he posted.Â Â  The master also noted Tamsberg and his predecessors paid property taxes.Â  The master concluded Tamsberg and his predecessors were in open, continuous, actual, hostile, and exclusive possession of the marsh.Â  Accordingly, the master held Tamsberg satisfied the twenty-year common law presumption of a grant and held irrefutable title to the land.\r\n \r\nAlford believes Tamsberg has not met the requisite element of â€œhostilityâ€ and, thus, cannot establish title to the marsh.Â  First, Alford maintains that Tamsberg cannot show his possession of the marsh was hostile to her because the State held title to the marsh until this litigation.Â  She believes the short amount of time that has transpired since the master declared she held legal title to the land was insufficient for Tamsberg to satisfy the hostility element.Â  For the reasons stated above, we find title to the marsh vested in Alfordâ€™s predecessors in 1797.Â  Accordingly, we findÂ  Alfordâ€™s argument on this point to be without merit.Â \r\n \r\nSecond, Alford maintains because Tamsberg claimed throughout the course of this litigation he owned the marsh by virtue of his title, his claim of ownership is insufficient to establish hostile possession.Â  Alford relies on Cook v. Eller, 298 S.C. 395, 397, 380 S.E.2d 853, 854 (1989), for the proposition that possession under the mistaken belief a party owns a parcel of land is insufficient to establish hostility.Â  We find Alfordâ€™s reliance is misplaced.Â  As the South Carolina Supreme Court stated in Wigfall v. Fobbs, the mistaken belief rule is applicable only to cases involving boundary disputes between adjoining landowners.Â  295 S.C. 59, 61-62, 367 S.E.2d 156, 158 (1998).Â  Therefore, possession of land under a mistaken belief that property is oneâ€™s own can constitute hostile possession if the case involves a dispute over an entire tract of land. Â See Clark v. Hargrave, 323 S.C. 84, 89, 473 S.E.2d 474, 478 (Ct. App. 1996) (finding the mistaken belief rule inapplicable to a dispute over an entire tract of land).Â  Although Alford and Tamsberg are adjoining property owners, the dispute over the marshland is over an entire tract of land.Â  Accordingly, we find the mistaken belief rule does not apply and Tamsberg has satisfied the element of hostility.\r\nAlford also contends Tamsbergâ€™s possession of the marsh has not been exclusive because she and her family have walked the property and posted â€œno trespassâ€ signs.Â  During trial, Tamsberg testified that he saw the â€œno trespassâ€ signs on his marsh, took them off, and carried them to Alfordâ€™s property.Â  Although the record is unclear, it appears the â€œno trespassâ€ signs were posted approximately the same time Alford filed suit.Â  We find Alfordâ€™s acts are insufficient to negate Tamsbergâ€™s and his predecessorsâ€™ exclusive possession of the property.Â  As noted earlier, Tamsberg improved and maintained the property. Â Further, he testified during the time he made the improvements Alford never informed him she believed she owned the property.Â  In addition, Tamsberg placed a conservation easement on his entire tract of land, including the marsh.Â  Accordingly, we find Tamsbergâ€™s acts are consistent with exclusive ownership of the marsh.\r\nMoreover, the master held Tamsberg and his predecessors had satisfied section 15-3-380 of the South Carolina Code (2005), the forty-year lapse statute.Â  The statute provides a party cannot commence an action for â€œthe recovery of real property or for interest therein against a person in possession under a claim of titleÂ  . . . unless the person claiming, his ancestor, or grantor, was actually in possession of the same . . . within forty years from the commencement of such action.â€Â  Further, section 15-3-380 permits tacking. S.C. Juris. Adverse Possession Â§ 19; see Sutton v. Clark, 59 S.C. 440, 454, 38 S.E. 150, 156 (1901) (finding that Â§15-3-380â€™s predecessor Code 1962 Â§10-129 permits the tacking of the time a party has been in possession with the time during which those under whom he claims held possession).Â  \r\n \r\nThe master found, and we so hold, Tamsberg and his predecessors have been in possession for at least forty-seven years.Â  Since at least 1956, when Belmont Hosiery consolidated two tracts to form what is now Tamsbergâ€™s property, Tamsberg and his predecessors have continually possessed the property at issue in this case.Â  During this time period, Tamsberg and his predecessors have hunted, maintained, improved, and hired caretakers to keep trespassers off the land.Â Â  Therefore, because Tamsberg has been in possession of the marsh since his 1990 purchase of the land, and he and his predecessors were in possession since at least 1956, and neither Alford nor her predecessors were in possession of the marshland for the previous forty year statutory period, we find the master properly held Tamsberg acquired title to the marsh under section 15-3-380.\r\nAlford also argues the master erred in finding the boundary to the marshlands was established as a matter of acquiescence.Â  She contends she always objected to Tamsbergâ€™s ownership of the marshlands.Â  Because we affirm the masterâ€™s order on the basis that Tamsberg established ownership of the marshlands through the presumption of a grant theory and the forty-year lapse statute, we find it unnecessary to reach Alfordâ€™s argument on this point. &nbsp;Matthews v. Dennis, 365 S.C. 245, 248 n.2, 616 S.E.2d 437, 439 n.2 (Ct. App. 2005); see also Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\nIII.Â  Res Judicata\r\nAlford argues the master erred in finding res judicata barred her claim. She also contends that in the first action, the State was an indispensable party to the suit involving marshlands and was not made a party.Â  She maintains res judicata cannot apply to actions where all necessary parties are not joined.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, we note Alfordâ€™s argument regarding the State as an indispensable party is not preserved for our review.Â  To preserve an issue for appellate review, the issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.Â  Charleston County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Jackson&nbsp; 368 S.C. 87, 104-05, 627 S.E.2d 765, 775&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006) (citing Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (â€œIt is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review)).Â  Alford did not raise this argument to the master.Â  Additionally, although Alfordâ€™s Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion did raise an assignment of error on the ground of res judicata, Alford did not raise the issue of the State as an indispensable party to the first action.Â  Therefore, this issue is not preserved.Â  See Washington v. Washington, 308 S.C. 549, 551, 419 S.E.2d 779, 781 (1992) (holding when an appellant neither raises an issue at trial nor through a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to amend, the issue is not properly presented to an appellate court for review).Â  Therefore, we decline to address whether the fact the State was not a party to the first action precludes the application of res judicata against Alford.\r\nWe now turn to address whether res judicata bars Alfordâ€™s claim.Â Â  Under the doctrine of res judicata, a litigant is barred from raising issues previously adjudicated between the parties in a subsequent action.Â  See Hilton Head Ctr. of S.C., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n of S.C., 294 S.C. 9, 11, 362 S.E.2d 176, 177 (1987).Â  Additionally, the doctrine of res judicata bars a litigant from raising any issues which may have been raised in the first action.Â  Pye v. Aycock,&nbsp; 325 S.C. 426, 432, 480 S.E.2d 455, 458&nbsp;(Ct. App.Â  1997)Â  Res judicata requires three elements: (1) a judgment that is final, valid, and on the merits; (2) the parties in the second action are identical to those in the first; and (3) the subsequent action must involve a subject matter properly included in the first action.Â  See Owenby v. Owens Corning Fiberglas, 313 S.C. 181, 183, 437 S.E.2d 130, 132 (Ct. App. 1993) (citing Laffitte v. Tucker, 216 S.C. 201, 57 S.E.2d 255 (1950)).Â  \r\n \r\nIn 1961, Alford brought suit against Tamsbergâ€™s predecessor in title, Belmont Hosiery, alleging she owned 40 acres of Belmont Hosieryâ€™s marshlands.Â  As part of a settlement in that suit, Belmont Hosiery gave Alford a quitclaim deed for the forty acres.Â  The deed provided, in part, â€œAlford acknowledges that by the acceptance of this quit-claim deed she has released Belmont Hosiery Mills, Inc., its successors and assigns, from any and all claims and demands whatsoever that she may have to the dates of these presents . . . .â€Â  On April 18, 1968, the trial court issued an order dismissing Alfordâ€™s complaint with prejudice.Â  The order provided that Alford was â€œforever barred from claiming or to make claim of the [d]efendant for damages . . . in respect to any of the matters and things set forth in the [c]omplaint in this cause.â€ Â Relying on the trial courtâ€™s dismissal and the settlement deed, the master concluded res judicata barred Alfordâ€™s claim.Â  \r\n\r\nThe first suit was dismissed with prejudice which served as an adjudication on the merits.Â  See RIM Assocs. v. Blackwell, 359 S.C. 170, 182, 597 S.E.2d 152, 159&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004) (quoting Nelson v. QHG of S.C., Inc., 354 S.C. 290, 311, 580 S.E.2d 171, 182 (Ct. App. 2003) (â€œA case that is dismissed â€˜with prejudiceâ€™ indicates an adjudication on the merits and, pursuant to res judicata, prohibits subsequent litigation to the same extent as if the action had been tried to a final adjudication.â€)).Â  Secondly, although Tamsberg was not involved in the first suit, we find he and Belmont Hosiery were in privity, and therefore, Tamsbergâ€™s legal interests were litigated in the first action.Â  See Richburg v. Baughman,&nbsp;290 S.C. 431, 434, 351 S.E.2d 164, 166&nbsp;(1986) (â€œOne in privity is one whose legal interests were litigated in the former proceeding.); see also First Natâ€™l. Bank of Greenville v. U. S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 207 S.C. 15, 26, 35 S.E.2d 47, 53&nbsp;(1945) (â€œâ€˜[P]rivity means a mutual or successive relationship to the same rights of property.â€™â€) (citation omitted).Â  Therefore, we find the master properly concluded res judicata bars Alfordâ€™s claim.Â \r\n \r\nAlford next argues that because the issue of ownership of the marshland pursuant to the 1797 Butler Grant was not raised in the first action, that the issues in the current litigation are different from those in the first action.Â  Essentially, she argues because she was unaware she owned all of Tamsbergâ€™s marshlands during the first suit that res judicata should not operate to defeat her claim.Â \r\n \r\nIn the first action, Alford attempted to prove title to forty acres of marshland.Â  At that time, she could have brought suit alleging she owned all of the marshland because the 1797 Butler Grant was located in the public records. In 1961, during the first suit, she could have thoroughly researched her title and brought the current suit.Â  Therefore, we find Alford could have brought a claim for all of the marshlands in the first suit.Â  We also note res judicata is based upon â€œthe principle that the public interest requires an end of litigation.â€ Price v. City of Georgetown,&nbsp; 297 S.C. 185, 187, 375 S.E.2d 335, 337&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1988) (citations omitted).Â  We find the third element, whether the subsequent action involves the same subject matter as the first, has been met because both actions involved title to the marshlands.Â  Accordingly, the master did not err in finding res judicata barred Alfordâ€™s claim.\r\nAdditionally, as an alternate sustaining ground we find that by accepting the quitclaim settlement deed, Alford agreed to release Belmont Hosiery, and its successors and assigns from all future claims regarding the disputed property.Â  See Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant,&nbsp;338 S.C. 406, 418, 526 S.E.2d 716, 722&nbsp;(2000) (allowing an appellate court to affirm on any ground in the record).Â  Therefore, Alford cannot maintain this action against Tamsberg because he is a future successor of Belmont Hosiery, and she agreed to forgo any future suit based on the disputed marshlands in exchange for forty acres.Â \r\n \r\nIV.Â  Motion For a New Trial\r\nAlford argues the master erred in denying her motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe grant or refusal of a new trial lies within the discretion of the trial court.Â \r\nGray v. Bryant,&nbsp;298 S.C. 285, 288, 379 S.E.2d 894, 896&nbsp;(1989) (citing \r\nJenkins v. Dixie Specialty Co., Inc., 284 S.C. 425, 326 S.E.2d 658 (1985)). Â In order to grant a new trial based upon the ground of newly discovered evidence a party must show: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t(1) that the evidence is such as will probably change the result, if a new trial is granted. (2) That it has been discovered since the trial. (3) That it could not have been discovered before the trial by the exercise of due diligence. (4) That it is material to the issue. (5) That it is not merely cumulative or impeaching . . . . \r\n\t\r\n\r\nEvatt v. Campbell, 234 S.C. 1, 11-12,106 S.E.2d 447, 453&nbsp;(1959) (citations omitted).Â  \r\n \r\nIn the present case, Alfordâ€™s newly discovered evidence consists of Â deeds from the 18th century, discovered subsequent to trial, that caused her to question the placement of the Butler Grant in relation to her land.Â  She contends the placement of the Butler Grant has a significant bearing on the boundary line between her and Tamsbergâ€™s property.Â  Although we appreciate the difficulty of drudging through old records and acknowledge that Alfordâ€™s task has not been easy, we find because the evidence could have been found, with due diligence, prior to the trial, it does not constitute newly discovered evidence.Â  Further, Alford has not shown how the newly discovered evidence would change the result of this case.Â  Regardless of what these new deeds reveal, we cannot conceive of a way in which they would change the fact Tamsbergâ€™s title to the marshlands is valid under the twenty year grant theory and the forty-year lapse statute.Â  Accordingly, we find the master properly denied Alfordâ€™s motion for a new trial.\r\nV.Â  Trespass\r\nAlford argues the master erred in dismissing her claim for trespass. She contends because she is the title owner to the marshlands, Tamsberg has trespassed upon her property.Â  For the reasons stated above, we find Tamsberg is the rightful owner of the marshlands, and, therefore, no claim of trespass can lie against him.Â  Accordingly, we find the master properly dismissed Alfordâ€™s claim.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the master properly concluded the boundary line to the highland portion between Alfordâ€™s and Tamsbergâ€™s adjoining properties is the center of the ditch.Â  We also find Tamsberg has established possession of a fee interest in the marshlands under the twenty year grant theory and the forty-year lapse statute.Â  Accordingly, the order of the master is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-351","title":"Eldridge v.

Kendall Few, of Greer and Thomas E Hite, Jr., of Abbeville, for Appellants-Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\tGeorge P. Callison, Jr. of Greenwood, for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This action was originally filed in 1986 concerning the former right-of-way owned by Southern Railway in and near the City of Greenwood.Â  The plaintiffs (hereinafter referred to as â€œthe property ownersâ€) brought suit seeking a declaratory judgment as to the abandonment and ownership of the right-of-way, to quiet title, and to determine damages for the taking of the abandoned right-of-way.Â  The first two actions were previously decided, and this cross-appeal involves only the determination of damages by the Special Referee for the taking of property by the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS[1]\r\nThe property owners sought damages related to two projects initiated by SCDOT in the former right-of-way abandoned by Southern Railway.Â  The first project (the 1986 project) consisted of two main areas: 1) the portion of the right-of-way which currently is situated between two existing roadways (Property Between The Roads); and 2) property directly adjacent to the existing landowners (Adjacent Property).Â  The second project (Calhoun Road Project) consisted of eighteen tracts located within the abandoned right-of-way along Calhoun Road.Â  The property owners consisted of two classes:Â  the current property owners along the right-of-way, and the heirs of the original landowners at the time the right-of-way was acquired by the railroad.\r\nPrior to trial, the parties stipulated to the number of square feet involved in the projects, the certification of the class, the interest rate to be charged, and the division among former and current property owners.Â  A hearing was held before the special referee and both sides presented expert testimony regarding the value of the property taken by SCDOT.\r\nDuring the hearing, the property ownersâ€™ appraiser concurred in the valuation established by SCDOTâ€™s appraiser for the adjacent property.Â  The Adjacent Property was valued at $3.50 per square foot.Â  The property ownersâ€™ appraiser then testified the Property Between The Roads should be reduced by no more than fifty percent of the value of the Adjacent Property.Â  In other words, he testified the Property Between The Roads should be valued at no less than $1.75 per square foot.\r\nThe property ownersâ€™ appraiser also testified regarding the valuations established for the Calhoun Road Project.Â  He testified the values used by SCDOT for the residential properties were accurate and fair.Â  However, he believed the values for commercial property were understated.Â  He testified that when looking at zoning classifications, some commercial property sold for $4.25 per square foot, while property in a prime location sold for $8.50 per square foot. Â He admitted he did not perform an individual appraisal of each property to be considered for valuation.Â  Instead, he stated he looked at the general location and the zoning classification and derived his value based on those general classifications.Â  Finally, the property ownersâ€™ appraiser admitted it would be much more desirable to do an individual appraisal on each property instead of the mass appraisal based on zoning classification. \r\n \r\nIn regards to the Property Between The Roads, the property ownersâ€™ appraiser admitted no buildings could be built on the property, but suggested it could be beautified and used for signs to attract attention to the businesses across the street.Â  However, he admitted he did not know whether or not a sign could be placed on the Property Between The Roads due to Greenwood County ordinances.\r\nSCDOTâ€™s appraiser testified in detail regarding his method for analyzing and valuing the individual properties.Â  He stated that the Property Between The Roads had no economic value to the landowners.Â  He stated that based on his understanding, no signs could be erected on the property, and it could not be used for anything to generate value.Â  The appraiser stated the owners only had liabilities associated with owning the property.\r\nAdditionally, SCDOTâ€™s appraiser testified regarding his appraisal of the individual properties in the Calhoun Road Project.Â  In contrast to the property ownersâ€™ appraiser, SCDOTâ€™s appraiser compared each property based on previous sales instead of just considering them based on their zoning.Â  His analysis showed values ranging from approximately $1.21 per square foot to $2.77 per square foot.\r\nAfter the hearing, the ordinances relevant to the issue of whether a sign may be erected on the Property Between The Roads were entered into evidence, and each side was able to submit letters regarding the application of the ordinances.Â  The ordinance sets forth specific requirements for â€œpermanent on premises identification signs for which a permit is required.â€\r\nThe referee ruled the Property Between The Roads could not house signs because they were not on the same premises owned by the landowners, were not adjoining or contingent to the property on which the business was located, and were not on property with the same ownership as the property on which the businesses were located.Â  As a result, the referee found no compensation was required for the Property Between The Roads.Â  The court also found the Adjacent Property should be valued at a total of $198,278.63.\r\nFinally, the court set forth the values of the individual properties involved in the condemnation for the Calhoun Road Project.Â  The court utilized the values set forth by SCDOTâ€™s appraiser for all of the properties except the commercial properties.Â  For the commercial properties, the court found a value between that offered by SCDOT and the value proposed by the property ownersâ€™ appraiser.Â  The commercial property values ranged from $2.00 to $5.00.Â  Neither party filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59, SCRCP.Â  This cross-appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action to recover damages resulting from the condemnation of property is an action at law.Â  See South Carolina Pub. Serv. Auth. v. Arnold,Â  287 S.C. 584, 586, 340 S.E.2d 535, 537 (1986).Â  In an action at law, tried by a judge without a jury, the findings of the trial court must be affirmed if there is any evidence to reasonably support them.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Property Ownersâ€™ Appeal\r\nThe property owners raise two main arguments: 1) the referee incorrectly ruled the Property Between The Roads could not be used for the purpose of erecting identification signs; and 2) the referee failed to establish some value for the Property Between the Roads.Â  We disagree.\r\nA.&nbsp; Signs\r\nThe property owners maintain the Property Between The Roads was â€œon the premisesâ€ of their businesses because it was either adjacent to or conjoining their property.Â  As a result, they argue the Property Between The Roads is available for their use to place identification signs and the Greenwood County ordinance would not prohibit the erection of signs on the property.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\tThe Greenwood County ordinance states:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(d) Permanent on premises identification signs for which a permit is required:Â  One (1) free-standing identification sign \r\n\t\tper lot for each 100 feet, or fraction thereof of street frontage over 200 feet, provided said signs shall . . . be located no closer than 5 feet from the nearest property line.Â  \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nRegulations covering similar â€œon premisesâ€ signs define the term to mean:Â  â€œany sign which is designed, intended or used to advertise or inform of the principal activity taking place, or the product being sold on the property where the sign is located.â€Â  25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 63-342 (Q) (Supp. 2006).Â \r\n \r\nThe term â€œon premisesâ€ in the Greenwood County ordinance also requires the sign be placed on the same lot as the entity being advertised.Â  In this case, we must determine whether the Property Between The Roads is the same lot as the land upon which the property owners have entities they wish to advertise.\r\nThe order of Judge Macaulay from 1996, which is the subject of Eldridge II, states:Â  â€œAs to that portion of the former right-of-way covered by streets, highways, and sidewalks for more than 20 years prior to the filing of the Complaint in this case on October 1, 1986, the title lies in the City, County, and Highway Department.â€Â  Â Judge Macaulay continued:\r\n\r\n\tUpon extinguishment of the easement, for that portion of the former Railroad right-of-way which has \r\n\tnot been covered by streets, highways, sidewalks, or other roadway improvements for a period of 20 years prior to the filing of this suit in 1986 . . . the unencumbered fee resides in the original property owners at the time of acquisition of these rights-of-way by the Railroad or the adjacent property owners at the time of the abandonment of the Railroad right-of-way in January 1985, which issue is left for future determination.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).Â  These rulings by Judge Macaulay were not appealed by either party.Â  Accordingly, they have become the law of the case.Â  See Charleston Lumber Co. v. Miller Housing Corp., 338 S.C. 171, 175, 525 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2000) (unappealed ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case).Â  Additionally, Judge Curetonâ€™s opinion in Eldridge II noted:Â  â€œThe [order by Judge Macaulay] made rulings relative to the [SCDOTâ€™s] adverse possession of portions of the corridor, as well as to the [SCDOTâ€™s] independent acquisition of rights of way from adjoining property owners.â€Â  Eldridge II, 331 S.C. 398, 436, 503 S.E.2d 191, 211 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nBased on the above unappealed rulings by Judge Macaulay, SCDOT owns the portion of the land upon which the roads are situated.Â  Therefore, the Property Between The Roads is physically separated from the property ownersâ€™ other property by the roads.Â  Accordingly, the Property Between The Roads is not contiguous, adjacent, or adjoining the property ownersâ€™ other property upon which the business entity is situated.Â  See e.g., Young v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Hwys and Pub. Transp., 287 S.C. 108, 110 n. 1, 336 S.E.2d 879, 880 n. 1 (Ct. App. 1985) (stating on premise signs are located â€œcontiguous with the land occupied by the commercial or industrial activity.â€). Â Concomitantly, the on premises sign ordinance would not allow a sign identifying the property ownersâ€™ business or other entity to be placed on the Property Between The Roads.Â  Accordingly, we find the referee correctly determined the Property Between The Roads could not be used for identification signs.\r\nB.&nbsp; Value of Property\r\nThe property owners contend the Property Between The Roads should have value because they could place signs on the property or, in the alternative, because it could be used for some purpose such as a parking space or a biking trail.Â  The property owners, therefore, assert some value should have been assigned to the property for purposes of the condemnation.Â \r\n \r\nThe property owners fail to cite any supporting authority for the position, and all arguments made are merely conclusory statements.Â  As such, the property owners have abandoned the issue on appeal and it need not be addressed by this court.Â  See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994).\r\nII.&nbsp; SCDOTâ€™s Appeal\r\nSCDOT maintains the referee erred in not accepting SCDOTâ€™s appraiserâ€™s value for the commercial property condemned in the Calhoun Road Project because there was no other valid evidence presented in the record.Â  We disagree.\r\nFirst, we note this issue is not preserved for review on appeal.Â  SCDOT is challenging the evidence presented in its issue on appeal.Â  However, the issue was never raised to the referee for his consideration.Â  SCDOT should have made a motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€) (citation omitted).\r\nEven if the issue were properly raised to the referee, there is evidence in the record supporting the refereeâ€™s valuation.Â  The property ownersâ€™ appraiser testified that the property was worth between $4.25 and $8.50.Â  SCDOTâ€™s appraiser valued the property between $1.21 and $2.77.Â  The courtâ€™s valuation placed a value on the property between $2.00 and $5.00.Â  Based on our standard of review, we find the range offered by the parties presents evidence supporting the refereeâ€™s conclusion that the value of the commercial properties fell within that range.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the referee correctly determined the Property Between The Roads could not be the site of identification signs used by the property owners due to the restrictions in the Greenwood County Ordinances.Â  We conclude, due to a failure to cite any supporting authority, the property owners have abandoned the issue which alleged error in finding the Property Between The Roads had no value for compensation purposes.Â  Finally, we determine the valuation placed on the commercial property condemned in the Calhoun Road Project was appropriate.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the referee is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, KITTREDGE, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] For a thorough discussion of the background of this action refer to Eldridge v.

(Child) from his custody.Â  Father argues the family court should not have removed Child because it did not find that he abused or neglected her.Â  Father further argues the family court did not comply with the statutory requirements that mandate the Department of Social Services (DSS) make reasonable efforts to prevent Childâ€™s removal.Â  Fatherâ€™s final argument is the family court failed to consider the appropriate factors in determining removal was in Childâ€™s best interests.Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nThis case commenced on April 1, 2006, when Crystal S. (Mother),[2] a minor child of age 17, entered the custody of DSS upon accusations of inappropriately touching a five-year-old male.Â  Thereafter, DSS learned Mother had a three-year-old daughter who at that time was living with her paternal great grandmother, Lynette B. (Great Grandmother).[3]Â  At a hearing on April 3, 2006, the family court ordered DSS to investigate Childâ€™s living environment at Great Grandmotherâ€™s home.Â  DSS visited the home the next day, and Great Grandmother informed DSS that Father also lived in her home, but he was not present at the time.Â  Later, DSS also learned that Great Grandmotherâ€™s home had an extensive history with law enforcement.Â  Due to the conditions of the home, the court entered an ex parte order on April 17, 2006, ordering Child to enter DSS custody.Â \r\n \r\nOn April 18, 2006, DSS initiated an action seeking removal of Child from Great Grandmotherâ€™s home on the grounds that Mother, Father, and Great Grandmother abused and/or neglected Child.Â  Following the probable cause hearing, the court ordered Child to be placed in emergency protective custody with DSS because (1) probable cause existed to believe Child had been neglected or abused, (2) DSS exercised reasonable efforts to prevent Childâ€™s removal, and (3) continuation in Great Grandmotherâ€™s home was not in Childâ€™s best interests.Â \r\n \r\nThe family court held the removal hearing on June 22, 2006.[4]Â  On August 2, 2006, the family court found DSS had not established by a preponderance of the evidence that Child was abused or neglected by Father or Great Grandmother.Â  The family court found the home of Father and Great Grandmother was not a suitable environment for Child and returning her to the home would be contrary to her best interests.Â  Further, because Father had no court order determining his paternity as to Child, and Mother and Father were not married, the family court ordered temporary custody of Child to DSS pending the merits hearing in the case against Mother.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn domestic matters, we may find facts based on the preponderance of the evidence, but we are not required to disregard the findings of the family court judge, who was in a better position to evaluate the witnessesâ€™ testimony and credibility.Â  Doe v. Doe,&nbsp;319 S.C. 151, 155, 459 S.E.2d 892, 894&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA. Custody of children born out of wedlock\r\nBefore we address Fatherâ€™s arguments, we must determine which parent has custody of Child.Â  Section 20-7-953(B) of the South Carolina Code (1976) provides:\r\n\r\n\tUnless the court orders otherwise, the custody of an illegitimate child is solely in the natural mother unless the mother has relinquished her rights to the child.Â  If paternity has been acknowledged or adjudicated, the father may petition the court for rights of visitation or custody in a proceeding before the court apart from an action to establish paternity.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nNeither party disputes that Mother and Father are not married nor that Child was conceived out of wedlock.Â  Based on these facts, the first sentence of the statute would place custody of Child with Mother.Â  The second sentence of the statute allows the Father to petition the court for custody if Father has acknowledged paternity.Â  The following excerpt illustrates Father acknowledged his paternity:\r\n\r\n\t[Court]:Â  Youâ€™re acknowledging youâ€™re the father?\r\n\t[Father]:Â  Yes.\r\n\t[Court]:Â  As the Father of this child, you do have an obligation to take care of it [sic] wherever it [sic] is.Â  Iâ€™m going to put you under an order to pay child support. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nFather acknowledged paternity, thus the second sentence of section 20-7-953(B) allows him to petition the court for custody.Â  However, the record is devoid of any attempt by Father to seek custody of Child.Â  The following is a passage from the family court proceeding in which DSS investigator Vickie Cook is being questioned by the family court judge:\r\n\r\n\t[Court]:Â  Okay. And so at this point and time, I guess to your knowledge is there any custody order concerning [Child] other than the D.S.S. order, which took her into protective custody?\r\n\t[Cook]:Â  Thatâ€™s the only order.Â  [Great Grandmother] . . . spoke of an attorney and that she was pursuing custody of [Child], but there was no order [regarding Child].\r\n\r\nÂ The record reveals Father never sought custody of Child.Â  Further, the family court informed Father that he had a right to seek custody of Child.Â  Consequently, Father does not have custody of Child. \r\n \r\nB. Removal based on abuse or neglect\r\nFather argues the family court erred in granting temporary legal and physical custody of Child to DSS because it did not comply with sections 20-736(F) and (I) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006).Â  Subsection (F) states the family court:\r\n\r\n\tshall not order that a child be removed from the custody of the parent or guardian unless the court finds that the allegations of the petition[5] are supported by a preponderance of evidence including a finding that the child is an abused or neglected child . . . Â and that retention of the child in or return of the Â child to the home would place the child at unreasonable risk of harm affecting the childâ€™s life, physical health or safety, or mental well-being and the child cannot reasonably be protected from this harm without being removed. \r\n\t\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nThe statute applies only if Child is in Fatherâ€™s custody.Â  As explained above, Father did not have custody of Child nor has Father sought custody.Â  Moreover, the case against Mother is pending.Â  Thus, section 20-7-736(F) is inapplicable.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\tSection 20-7-736(I) states: \r\n\tIf the court removes custody of the child, the courtâ€™s order shall contain a finding by the court of whether reasonable efforts were made by the department to prevent removal of the child and a finding of whether continuation of the child in the home would be contrary to the welfare of the child.Â  The order shall state: (1) the services made available to the family before the removal of the child and how they related to the needs of the family; (2) the efforts of the agency to provide these services to the family before removal; (3) why the efforts to provide services did not eliminate the need for removal; and (4) whether the efforts to eliminate the need for removal were reasonable. . . .Â  If the departmentâ€™s first contact with the child occurred under such circumstances that reasonable services would not have allowed the child to remain safely in the home, the court shall find that removal of the child without services or without further services was reasonable.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nOnce again, the statute applies only if Child is in Fatherâ€™s custody.Â  As explained above, Father did not have custody of Child.Â  Thus, section 20-7-736(I) is inapplicable.Â  Additionally, given the fact that DSS took Child into protective custody pursuant to an ex parte order, this would not allow DSS sufficient time to provide services.Â  Therefore, under the circumstances, the efforts made by DSS to prevent removal were reasonable.Â Â \r\n \r\nC. The Moore[6] factors \r\nFather contends the family court erred because it failed to consider the Moore factors in determining that removal was in the best interests of Child.Â  Specifically, Father argues absent a finding that Child was abused or neglected or that Father is an unfit parent, the family court erred in concluding removal was in Childâ€™s best interests.\r\nOur courts have typically used the Moore factors in actions in which a natural parent seeks to regain custody of a child after the parent has voluntarily surrendered custody of a child to a third person.Â  Charleston County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. King, 369 S.C. 96, 102, 631 S.E.2d 239, 242 (2006); Dodge v. Dodge, 332 S.C. 401, 411, 505 S.E.2d 344, 349 (Ct. App. 1998) (â€œIn Moore, the supreme court outlined the criteria to consider in determining custody when a natural parent seeks to reclaim custody from a third party.â€).Â  \r\n \r\nHowever, in the present case, neither Father nor Mother voluntarily relinquished custody of Child.Â  Rather, the court ordered Child to be placed in emergency protective custody when DSS investigated Childâ€™s living environment, and the lower court found probable cause to remove Child from Father and Great Grandmotherâ€™s home.Â  Thus, the Moore factors do not apply in the circumstances of the present case.Â  Accordingly, the family court did not err in failing to consider the Moore factors in its determination of Childâ€™s removal from the home.\r\nâ€œ[T]he welfare of the child and what is in his/her best interest is the primary, paramount and controlling consideration of the court in all child custody controversies.â€Â  Davis v. Davis, 356 S.C. 132, 135, 588 S.E.2d 102, 103-04 (2003) (internal citations and quotations omitted).Â  Father and Great Grandmother are the two named defendants.Â  The case against Mother is pending.Â  The issue of neglect, with respect to Mother, has not been fully litigated.Â  We hold it is in Childâ€™s best interests to remain in the custody of DSS while the case against Mother is resolved.Â  See Ex Parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 61-62, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652 (2006) (In an appeal from a family court order, an appellate court is not required to disregard the findings of the family court judge.Â  This degree of deference is especially true in cases involving a childâ€™s welfare and best interests.). \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the lower courtâ€™s decision is  \r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.[7]Â  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The names of the minor child and the defendants have been changed to protect the minorâ€™s identity. \r\n \r\n[2] Mother is not a party to this appeal. \r\n \r\n[3] Great Grandmother is not a party to this appeal. \r\n \r\n[4] On June 22, 2006, the family court heard the matter only as to Father and Great Grandmother.Â  The case was continued as to Mother because her court-appointed attorney was absent from the hearing.Â  Â \r\n[5] Section 20-7-736(B) states DSS â€œmay petition the family court to remove the child from custody of the parent, guardian, or other person legally responsible for the childâ€™s welfare if [DSS] determines by a preponderance of evidence that the child is an abused or neglected child and that the child cannot be safely maintained in the home in that he cannot be protected from unreasonable risk of harm affecting the childâ€™s life, physical health, safety, or mental well-being without removal.â€Â Â Â \r\n \r\n[6] In Moore v. Moore, our Supreme Court established the following criteria to consider in making custody determinations when a parent seeks to reclaim custody: (1) the parent must prove that he or she is a fit parent, able to properly care for the child and provide a good home; (2) the amount of contact, in the form of visits, financial support or both, which the parent had with the child while it was in the care of the third party; (3) the circumstances under which temporary relinquishment occurred; and (4) the degree of attachment between the child and the temporary custodian.Â  300 S.C. 75, 79-80, 386 S.E.2d 456, 458 (1989).\r\n[7] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-354","title":"Brunson v.

Anderson, Family Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-354\r\nSubmitted May 1, 2007 â€“ Filed July 16, 2007\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tThomas F. McDow, of Rock Hill, for Appellant/Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\tDavid C. Shea and John S. Nichols, both of Columbia, for Respondent/Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this domestic action, Lois Brunson (Wife) and Dennis Brunson (Husband) appeal the family courtâ€™s order.Â  Both parties assign numerous points of error, including the award of alimony, the equitable distribution of the marital assets, and the failure to award attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nWife and Husband married on March 9, 1986 and separated on October 18, 2002.Â  Both parties had children from their previous marriages, but they had no children from their marriage.Â  Wife brought a home into the marriage worth approximately $70,000 at the time they married, which had a mortgage of approximately $32,000.Â  Wife also had a retirement account worth $12,000 at the time of the marriage.Â  In 1993, when the account was worth $25,000, Wife withdrew the funds with Husbandâ€™s knowledge and spent them on the family and improvements to the marital home.Â  In 1998, with Wifeâ€™s knowledge, Husband opened a â€œblow account,â€ into which he deposited funds for his personal use. \r\n \r\nDuring the marriage, Wife worked as manager of a credit union and earned approximately $34,000 per year.Â  During her employment, Wife used Husbandâ€™s and her daughterâ€™s name to secure several loans and obtained additional funds on already existing loans in their names.Â  Much of the loan proceeds were used to finance a ski boat, a vehicle, a tractor, family vacations, to pay off credit cards, and for other family purposes.Â  When the credit union learned of Wifeâ€™s actions, she was fired.Â  \r\n \r\nIn September 2003, Wife pled guilty, pursuant to a negotiated plea, to twelve charges of forgery, four charges of bank fraud, and one charge of breach of trust.Â  Wife received concurrent sentences amounting to a ten-year sentence suspended upon five years probation.Â  Prior to her guilty plea, she paid $30,000 in restitution, and at the time of the divorce decree, she still owed approximately $26,000 in restitution as well as $4,250 in fees. Â \r\nWife is currently employed at a salon and spa and has gross earnings of $1,163.72 per month and net earnings of $923.74.Â  Husband continues to work at Duke Power. Â He has gross monthly earnings of $5,339, and after taxes and insurance premiums, he has net earnings of $3,045. Â He also receives mileage income and a yearly bonus.Â  Wife settled a personal injury lawsuit for $32,500 prior to attorneyâ€™s fees and medical bills, but at the commencement of litigation, Wife had yet to receive the proceeds.Â  Husband received a workersâ€™ compensation settlement for $108,000 following the partiesâ€™ separation.Â  \r\n \r\nOn November 2, 2002, Wife filed a complaint requesting alimony, separate maintenance and support, equitable apportionment of the marital property, attorneyâ€™s fees, and pendente lite relief.Â  On December 11, 2002, the family court issued a temporary order declining to award alimony pendente lite.Â  Further, the family court determined Husband would retain the use of the marital home but ordered him to pay Wife $300 per month as an unspecified advance for the use of her interest in the home.Â \r\n \r\nHusband remained in the marital home until the summer of 2003, when he moved in with his girlfriend in North Carolina.Â  In June 2004, Husband bought a home in North Carolina.Â  Husbandâ€™s son continued to reside in the marital home.Â  Wife has lived with her mother since the partiesâ€™ separation.Â  On November 20, 2003, Wife filed a supplemental complaint requesting a divorce on the grounds of adultery and one yearâ€™s continuous separation.Â  \r\n\r\nOn February 9, 2005, the family court granted the parties a divorce based on one yearâ€™s continuous separation.Â  The family court awarded sixty percent of the marital estate to Husband and forty percent to Wife. Â The family court ordered the parties to sell the marital home, but it found Wife had a special equity of $35,000 in the home.Â  Additionally, the family court found each party should retain all of their respective personal injury awards.Â  The remainder of the marital estate was valued at $21,195, although $2,100 of that value was debt.Â  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the family court classified the $300 monthly payment to Wife as alimony.Â  The family court found Wife was entitled to continue receiving alimony until December 2005, explaining the award was both rehabilitative and lump sum and would enable her to maintain some stability during the next year while the property division was being accomplished and would also help her maintain health insurance.Â  In addition, the family court determined each party should be responsible for their respective attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Wife filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion for reconsideration, and the family court reaffirmed its order, making minor modifications.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from a family court order, this Court has authority to correct errors of law and find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  \r\nE.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 473, 415 S.E.2d 812, 814 (1992).Â  When reviewing decisions of the family court, we are cognizant of the fact that the family court had the opportunity to see the witnesses, hear â€œthe testimony delivered from the stand, and had the benefit of that personal observance of and contact with the parties which is of peculiar value in arriving at a correct result in a case of this character.â€Â  DuBose v. DuBose, 259 S.C. 418, 423, 192 S.E.2d 329, 331 (1972) (internal quotations omitted). Â When the evidence is conflicting and susceptible of different inferences, the family court has the duty of determining not only the law of the case, but the facts as well.Â  Anders v. Anders, 285 S.C. 512, 514, 331 S.E.2d 340, 341 (1985); see also Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996) (holding when evidence is disputed, the appellate court may adhere to the family courtâ€™s findings).Â  \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Alimony\r\nWife contends the family court erred in awarding rehabilitative and lump sum alimony rather than permanent periodic alimony because the family court failed to make findings of special circumstances.Â  Wife further argues the family court erred in awarding alimony of only $300 per month. Â Husband contends the family court erred in awarding Wife any alimony.Â  \r\n \r\nThe amount of alimony, as well as a determination of whether the spouse is entitled to alimony, is within the sound discretion of the family court.Â  Smith v. Smith, 264 S.C. 624, 628, 216 S.E.2d 541, 543 (1975).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the decision is controlled by an error of law or is based on factual findings that are without evidentiary support.Â  \r\nDegenhart v. Burriss, 360 S.C. 497, 500, 602 S.E.2d 96, 97 (Ct. App. 2004). Â \r\nThe purpose of alimony is to place the supported spouse, as close as is practical, in the same position of support as during the marriage.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988). Â If the claim for alimony is well-founded, the family court has the duty of making â€œan alimony award that is fit, equitable, and just.â€Â  Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 184, 554 S.E.2d 421, 424 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The family court should consider the following factors in awarding alimony: \r\n \r\n\r\n\t(1) duration of the marriage; (2) physical and emotional health of the parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4) employment history and earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living established during the marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the parties; (7) current and reasonably anticipated expenses of the parties; (8) marital and nonmarital properties of the parties; (9) custody of children; (10) marital misconduct or fault; (11) tax consequences; and (12) prior support obligations; as well as (13) other factors the court considers relevant.\r\n\r\nId. (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2000)).Â  \r\n \r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court has further held that â€œ[t]hree important factors in awarding periodic alimony are (1) the duration of the marriage; (2) the overall financial situation of the parties, especially the ability of the supporting spouse to pay; and (3) whether either spouse was more at fault than the other.â€Â  Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 529, 599 S.E.2d 114, 121 (2004).Â  \r\n \r\nThe family court may grant alimony and separate maintenance and support awards pendente lite and permanently in amounts and for lengths of time that the family court considers appropriate under the circumstances.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(B) (Supp. 2006).Â  These awards may include: â€œ(1) periodic alimony . . . (2) lump-sum alimony . . . (3) rehabilitative alimony . . . (4) reimbursement alimony . . . (5) separate maintenance and support . . . [and] (6) [s]uch other form of spousal support, under terms and conditions as the court may consider just, as appropriate under the circumstances without limitation to grant more than one form of support.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nÂ Section 20-3-130(B)(2) describes lump sum alimony as â€œa finite total sum to be paid in one installment, or periodically over a period of time, terminating only upon the death of the supported spouse, but not terminable or modifiable based upon remarriage or changed circumstances in the future.â€ Â The statute further provides the purpose of lump sum alimony may include, but not be limited to, circumstances in which the family court finds alimony appropriate but determines that the award be finite and nonmodifiable.Â  Id.Â Â Â Â  To grant lump sum alimony, the court must find special circumstances that would make any award of lump sum alimony advisable.Â  Atkinson v. Atkinson, 279 S.C. 454, 456-57, 309 S.E.2d 14, 15 (Ct. App. 1983).Â  \r\n \r\nTypically, the primary justification in awarding lump sum alimony is the unreliability of the supporting spouse to make regular payments.Â  See Roy T. Stuckey, Marital Litigation in South Carolina 217 (3d ed. 2001); see also Jones v. Jones, 270 S.C. 280, 282, 241 S.E.2d 904, 905 (1978) (upholding the award of $36,000 in lump sum alimony when husband drank excessively, was not regularly employed, had failed to pay child support for the last five years, threatened to leave the country to avoid payments, and had just inherited property valued near $100,000); Murdock v. Murdock,243 S.C. 218, 225, 133 S.E.2d 323, 326 (1963) (affirming lump sum alimony of $4,250 when the husband moved to a distant state, remarried, and had been found in contempt of court for failing to pay pendente lite alimony); Hendricks v. Hendricks,285 S.C. 591, 594, 330 S.E.2d 553, 554 (Ct. App. 1985) (affirming lump sum alimony of $30,000 when husband failed to support his family for nineteen years and quickly spent a $45,000 inheritance by purchasing a truck and by paying the hospital bills of a paramour in another state).Â  \r\n \r\nOn the other hand, section 20-3-130(B)(3) defines rehabilitative alimony as follows:\r\n\r\n\t[A] finite sum to be paid in one installment or periodically, terminable upon the remarriage or continued cohabitation of the supported spouse, the death of either spouse . . . or the occurrence of a specific event to occur in the future, or modifiable based upon unforeseen events frustrating the good faith efforts of the supported spouse to become self-supporting or the ability of the supporting spouse to pay the rehabilitative alimony.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe purpose of rehabilitative alimony may include, but is not limited to, circumstances in which the family court finds providing for the rehabilitation of the supported spouse appropriate.Â  Id.; see also Eagerton v. Eagerton, 285 S.C. 279, 282, 328 S.E.2d 912, 914 (Ct. App. 1985) (â€œThe purpose of rehabilitative alimony is to encourage a dependent spouse to become self-supporting by providing alimony for a limited period of time during which the dependent spouse might retrain and rehabilitate himself or herself thereby limiting the duration of the time in which the supporting spouse is burdened by spousal support.â€). Â Moreover, rehabilitative alimony permits a couple to develop their own lives free from obligations to each other. Â Id., 328 S.E.2d at 914-15.Â  For the family court to grant rehabilitative alimony, the evidence must demonstrate the supported spouse will be self-sufficient at the expiration of the ordered payments. Â Toler v. Toler, 292 S.C. 374, 378, 356 S.E.2d 429, 431 (Ct. App. 1987).\r\nIn its decision to award lump sum and rehabilitative alimony, the family court stated it was continuing the temporary alimony of $300 per month.Â  However, the $300 per month provided by the temporary order was not temporary alimony but rather an unspecified advance on Wifeâ€™s interest in the home.Â  Further, we find the family court failed to make sufficient findings to support its award of lump sum and rehabilitative alimony.\r\nThe family court stated the award was to enable Wife to maintain some stability during the next year while the property division was being accomplished and to help her maintain health insurance.Â  Without further justification, these findings are insufficient to justify either lump sum or rehabilitative alimony.Â  \r\n \r\nConsequently, the insufficiency of the record before this Court requires us to remand this case to the family court to determine whether an alimony award is appropriate.Â  On remand, if the family court wishes to award alimony, it must make specific findings in the order to support the award.Â  \r\n \r\nFurther, alimony is intended to be neither a reward nor a punishment. Â Kane v. Kane, 280 S.C. 479, 484, 313 S.E.2d 327, 330 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  The purpose of alimony is to maintain as near as possible the status quo established by the parties during the marriage.Â  Id.Â  In determining whether to award alimony and what amount and type of alimony to award, â€œ[A]ll of the facts and circumstances disclosed by the record should be considered; no one factor should be determined dispositive.â€Â  Nienow v. Nienow, 268 S.C. 161, 171, 232 S.E.2d 504, 510 (1977). Â \r\nBased on these considerations, we leave it to the family courtâ€™s discretion to take into account all of the relevant factors in determining whether alimony is appropriate, and if it is, in deciding what type and what amount should be awarded.Â \r\n \r\nII.Â  Equitable Distribution\r\nA.Â  Overall Distribution\r\nBoth Husband and Wife maintain the family court erred in awarding a sixty-forty division of marital property in favor of Husband.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe division of marital property is within the family courtâ€™s sound discretion, and this decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Â Craig v. Craig, 365 S.C. 285, 290, 617 S.E.2d 359, 361 (2005).Â  The appellate court looks to the overall fairness of the apportionment. Â Deidun v. Deidun, 362 S.C. 47, 58, 606 S.E.2d 489, 495 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  If the end result is equitable, the fact that the appellate court would have arrived at a different apportionment is irrelevant. Â Id. Â â€œThe doctrine of equitable distribution is based on a recognition that marriage is, among other things, an economic partnership.â€ Â Mallett v. Mallett, 323 S.C. 141, 150, 473 S.E.2d 804, 810 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œUpon dissolution of the marriage, property acquired during the marriage should be divided and distributed in a manner which fairly reflects each spouseâ€™s contribution to its acquisition, regardless of which spouse holds legal title.â€Â  Id.\r\nIn making an equitable apportionment of marital property, the family court must proportionately weigh the following factors:\r\n\r\n\tÂ (1) the duration of the marriage together with the ages of the parties at the time of the marriage and at the time of the divorce or separate maintenance or other marital action between the parties; (2) marital misconduct or fault of either or both parties, whether or not used as a basis for a divorce as such, if the misconduct affects or has affected the economic circumstances of the parties, or contributed to the breakup of the marriage; provided, that no evidence of personal conduct which would otherwise be relevant and material for purposes of this subsection shall be considered with regard to this subsection if such conduct shall have taken place subsequent to the happening of the earliest of (a) entry of a pendente lite order in a divorce or separate maintenance action; (b) formal signing of a written property or marital settlement agreement; or (c) entry of a permanent order of separate maintenance and support or of a permanent order approving a property or marital settlement agreement between the parties; (3) the value of the marital property, whether the property be within or without the State. The contribution of each spouse to the acquisition, preservation, depreciation, or appreciation in value of the marital property, including the contribution of the spouse as homemaker; provided, that the court shall consider the quality of the contribution as well as its factual existence; (4) the income of each spouse, the earning potential of each spouse, and the opportunity for future acquisition of capital assets; (5) the health, both physical and emotional, of each spouse; (6) the need of each spouse or either spouse for additional training or education in order to achieve that spousesâ€™s income potential; (7) the nonmarital property of each spouse; (8) the existence or nonexistence of vested retirement benefits for each or either spouse; (9) whether separate maintenance or alimony has been awarded; (10) the desirability of awarding the family home as part of equitable distribution or the right to live therein for reasonable periods to the spouse having custody of any children; (11) the tax consequences to each or either party as a result of any particular form of equitable apportionment; (12) the existence and extent of any support obligations, from a prior marriage or for any other reason or reasons, of either party; (13) liens and any other encumbrances upon the marital property, which themselves must be equitably divided, or upon the separate property of either of the parties, and any other existing debts incurred by the parties or either of them during the course of the marriage; (14) child custody arrangements and obligations at the time of the entry of the order; and (15) such other relevant factors as the trial court shall expressly enumerate in its order.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2006).Â   \r\nThese criteria are intended to guide the family court in exercising its discretion over apportionment of the marital property. Â Johnson, 296 S.C. at 297, 372 S.E.2d at 112.Â  They are only equities to be considered in reaching a fair distribution of marital property. Â Id. at 297-98, 372 S.E.2d at 112.Â  \r\n \r\nThe ultimate goal of apportionment is both to divide the marital estate, as a whole, in a manner which fairly reflects each spouseâ€™s contribution to the economic partnership and to have the relative effect of ending that partnership on each of the parties.Â  Johnson, 296 S.C. at 298, 372 S.E.2d at 112.\r\nAwards such as the instant case have been previously upheld by this Court.Â  In Brandi v. Brandi, the marriage lasted ten years, the parties were approximately the same age, the husband was in better health, husbandâ€™s adultery caused the breakup of the marriage, the husband demonstrated a greater earning capacity, the husband had far greater nonmarital assets, and he made most of the direct contributions to the acquisition of the marital property.Â  302 S.C. 353, 357, 396 S.E.2d 124, 126 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  The wifeâ€™s contributions, on the other hand, were primarily indirect contributions as a homemaker.Â  Id.Â  The family court awarded the husband seventy percent of the marital property.Â  Id. at 356, 396 S.E.2d at 125.Â  This Court found the award to the wife was most liberal but was not an abuse of discretion.Â  Id. at 358, 396 S.E.2d at 127.Â  \r\n \r\nPrecedent supports similar divisions based on this Stateâ€™s current equitable distribution regime.Â  See Wynn v. Wynn, 360 S.C. 117, 126, 600 S.E.2d 71, 75 (Ct. App. 2004) (modifying family courtâ€™s order to include jointly incurred credit card debt but upholding the family courtâ€™s award of fifty-five percent of the marital estate to the husband following nineteen-year marriage); Pool v. Pool, 321 S.C. 84, 88-89, 467 S.E.2d 753, 756 (Ct. App. 1996) (finding no abuse of discretion when family court awarded sixty percent of marital estate to the husband and forty percent to the wife, wherein marriage lasted three years, the husband made greater direct contributions to marriage, but both parties contributed equally in terms of indirect contributions); Â Sharpe v. Sharpe, 307 S.C. 540, 542, 416 S.E.2d 215, 216 (Ct. App. 1992) (affirming a sixty-five percent division of the marital estate in favor of the husband when parties were married for eighteen years, the husband committed post-separation adultery, and wife conspired to kill husband post-separation); Cross v. Cross, 296 S.C. 474, 475, 374 S.E.2d 178, 178 (1988) (modifying family courtâ€™s order for failure to offset the husbandâ€™s tax payment but upholding its award of eighty-three percent of the marital assets to the wife when parties were married for nine years and the wife made significant non-marital contributions); Coxe v. Coxe, 294 S.C. 291, 294, 363 S.E.2d 906, 908 (Ct. App. 1987) (upholding an award of twenty-five percent of the marital estate to the wife in a marriage that lasted approximately eighteen years, and in which wife could not work outside the home due to a pre-marital disability); Josey v. Josey, 291 S.C. 26, 32, 351 S.E.2d 891, 895 (Ct. App. 1986) (affirming family courtâ€™s award of sixty percent of marital estate to the husband and forty percent to the wife and finding despite husbandâ€™s adultery, the award bore a reasonable relationship to the relative direct and indirect contributions of the parties); Watson v. Watson, 291 S.C. 13, 19-20, 351 S.E.2d 883, 887-88 (Ct. App. 1986) (upholding family courtâ€™s award of thirty-two percent of marital estate to wife after a twenty-three year marriage in which the husbandâ€™s earning potential was vastly superior to that of the wife); Millis v. Millis, 282 S.C. 610, 612-13, 320 S.E.2d 66, 67 (Ct. App. 1984) (finding no abuse of discretion in awarding the wife twenty percent of the marital estate after a fourteen-year marriage).\r\nThe equitable distribution of the marital estate is within the sound discretion of the family court, and its decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Coxe, 294 S.C. at 295, 363 S.E.2d at 908.Â  Because family court judges are given broad jurisdiction in the equitable distribution of marital property, the family court may use any reasonable means to divide the estate equitably.Â  Id.Â  Accordingly, examining the overall contributions of the parties and the remaining equitable distribution factors, we find the family court did not abuse its discretion in making the distribution.Â  We specifically address some of Husbandâ€™s and Wifeâ€™s assertions of error below.[1]\r\nB.Â  Personal Injury/Workersâ€™ Compensation\r\nWife asserts the family court erred in apportioning all of Husbandâ€™s proceeds from his workersâ€™ compensation action to Husband because the cause of action occurred before the date of filing and the family court did not make sufficient findings for judicial review.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œ[P]roceeds of a personal injury settlement acquired during the marriage are marital property subject to the family courtâ€™s jurisdiction.â€Â  Marsh v. Marsh, 313 S.C. 42, 46, 437 S.E.2d 34, 36 (1993).Â  However,\r\n\r\n\trecognition of the award or settlement as marital property does not mean the proceeds of the award must be divided and a portion awarded to the non-injured spouse. Â To the contrary; the family court may, and in many cases probably should, award the proceeds entirely to the injured spouse. Â We emphasize the family court is not required to divide all marital property between the spouses based on the same percentage of division. Â For example, the court could divide the general marital property equally between the two but award the personal injury compensation entirely to the injured spouse.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nId. at 45, 437 S.E.2d at 36 (citations omitted). Â In this case, Husbandâ€™s cause of action arose before the parties were married, and he suffered no symptoms during the marriage.Â  Further, he settled it after they separated.Â  Accordingly, we find the family court did not abuse its discretion in apportioning each partyâ€™s award to them individually.\r\nC.Â  Sale of Marital Home \r\nWife maintains the family court erred in ordering the sale of the marital home instead of awarding the home to Husband because Husband was in possession of the home since the separation and the home likely decreased in value as a result of Husbandâ€™s lack of maintenance.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo effect an equitable division of property, the family court may require the sale of the marital home. Â Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 360, 384 S.E.2d 741, 745 (1989). Â Before ordering the sale of marital property, the court should first attempt to make an in-kind distribution of the marital assets. Â Craig, 365 S.C. at 289, 617 S.E.2d at 361.\r\nHusband and Wifeâ€™s marital property, other than the marital home, totaled approximately $21,000.Â  Because the home was valued at $122,000, distributing the home in-kind would have been impossible as the remaining marital estate was inadequate to offset an in-kind award of the home to one spouse.Â  Accordingly, the family court did not abuse its discretion in ordering the sale of the marital home. \r\n \r\nD.Â  Special Equity\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in awarding Wife a special equity of $35,000 in the home.Â  We disagree.\r\nAlthough the house belonged to Wife prior to the marriage, neither party disputes that it is marital property.Â  Accordingly, this determination is the law of the case.Â  Dreher v. Dreher,370 S.C. 75, 78 n.1, 634 S.E.2d 646, 647 n.1 (2006). Â \r\nThe family court awarded Wife a â€œspecial equityâ€ of $35,000 in the home.Â  The family court did not specify why it was awarding Wife such equity, but presumably it was for the $35,000 of equity in the house that Wife brought into the marriage.Â  However, the family court improperly used this term as a spouse only acquires special equity in nonmarital property by contributing to improvements to that nonmarital property. Â Johnson, 296 S.C. at 299, 372 S.E.2d at 113; see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473(5) (Supp. 2006).\r\nWhile this award does not fit the definition of special equity, we find it was not an abuse of the family courtâ€™s discretion to award Wife her premarital contribution towards the marital home.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the family courtâ€™s award of $35,000 to Wife.\r\nIII.Â  Findings of Fact\r\nWife contends the family court erred in finding Wifeâ€™s behavior brought Husband public embarrassment, financial strain, and worry that Husband would be implicated in the fraud because Husband â€œtook delightâ€ in Wifeâ€™s legal troubles and the financial strain occurred prior to the separation.\r\nThe family court made this finding, but it also acknowledged Husband took some personal delight in Wifeâ€™s misfortune.Â  Further, the family court found the money Wife obtained through her financial misdeeds was used for family luxuries, and while Husband may not have condoned it, he should have been more informed and involved with family finances.Â  Accordingly, we find Wife suffered no prejudice as a result of the family courtâ€™s finding.\r\n \r\nIV.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nWife contends the family court erred in failing to award her attorneyâ€™s fees but concedes she would only be entitled to them if this Court grants her any relief on appeal.Â  Husband contends the family court erred in failing to award him attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\n \r\nThe family court has discretion in deciding whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, and its decision will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion. Â Donahue, 299 S.C. at 365, 384 S.E.2d at 748.Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the decision is controlled by an error of law or is based on factual findings that are without evidentiary support.Â  \r\nDegenhart, 360 S.C. at 500, 602 S.E.2d at 97. Â \r\nSection 20-7-420(A)(38) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) authorizes the family court to award attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  In deciding whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court should consider: (1) each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fee; (2) the beneficial results obtained by the attorney; (3) the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions; and (4) the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  E.D.M., 307 S.C. at 476-77, 415 S.E.2d at 816. Â \r\nWifeâ€™s beneficial results may change because of our decision to remand the determination of alimony, so the family court should reconsider the issue of whether to award Wife attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Peirson v. Calhoun, 308 S.C. 246, 255, 417 S.E.2d 604, 609 (Ct. App. 1992); see also Epperly v. Epperly, 312 S.C. 411, 416, 440 S.E.2d 884, 886-87 (1994) (â€œAs to the beneficial result obtained, it is clear that Wife did not prevail in the initial action. However, upon appeal, she has succeeded in part. Â Therefore, this issue is remanded to the [f]amily [c]ourt for reconsideration.â€).Â  However, we find the family court did not err in failing to award Husband attorneyâ€™s fees, considering Husbandâ€™s financial situation is far superior to that of Wife and he has the ability to pay his own fees.\r\nV.Â  Name Change\r\nWife maintains the family court erred in requiring the clerk of court to notify the State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) of Wifeâ€™s resumption of her maiden name when such notification is not required by section 15-49-20(D) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006).Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 15-49-20(D) provides, â€œIf a petitioner is found to have a criminal record as indicated by the background check and the court grants the petition for a name change, the clerk of court must notify [SLED] of the petitionerâ€™s new name. Â The division must make the appropriate changes to the petitioner's criminal record.â€Â  However, section 15-49-20(J) provides,\r\n \r\n\r\n\tThe provisions of this section do not apply to a person who wishes to resume her maiden name as a result of a domestic action filed in family court. A family court judge may authorize a name change for a person wishing to resume her maiden name in another order including, but not limited to, an order for separate support and maintenance or a final divorce decree.\r\n\r\nAlthough the section does not require the family court to report Wifeâ€™s name change to SLED, we find the family court did not abuse its discretion in doing so.Â  Wife was not changing her name in an attempt to avoid prosecution or enforcement, but she is a convicted felon.Â  Our research does not reveal any statute or case, nor does Wife point us to any, prohibiting the family court from reporting a name change in a situation similar to the present. \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the family courtâ€™s order is  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nSTILWELL, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.[2]\r\n\r\n[1] Wife also contends the family court erred (1) in referencing the reasons for the disintegration of the marriage and in failing to make specific findings on Husbandâ€™s contributions to the disintegration of the marriage; (2) in considering her financial misconduct because economic misconduct against a third person is not a factor to be considered in determining distribution of marital property; and (3) in apportioning the equity, taxes, and necessity of repairs of the home to both parties because Husband was in possession of the home and Wife received only $300 per month as an unspecified advance for the use of her interest in the home.\r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-355","title":"Penland v.

Derham Cole, Circuit Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-355\r\nHeard June 6, 2007 â€“ Filed July 17, 2007Â Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tWilliam S.F. Freeman, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tJohn Kevin Owens, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Charles W. Penland, d/b/a Woodruff Auto Sales, (Woodruff) appeals from a jury determination that State Farm Fire and Casualty Company had provided it with notice of cancellation of insurance on a vehicle in which Woodruff was the lienholder.Â  Penland argues the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that State Farm had the burden of proving Woodruff had actually received notice of the cancellation.Â  We affirm.Â \r\n \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nLeonard Hinton, Jr. and Tamara J. Hinton purchased a Ford Mustang and received financing from Woodruff.Â  The installment sale contract required the Hintons to maintain insurance on the vehicle.Â  Leonard Hinton obtained the required insurance from State Farm.Â  The insurance policyâ€™s declaration page provided the vehicle was financed through Woodruff.Â \r\n \r\nState Farm cancelled the policy effective February 11, 2001.Â  Although State Farm employees testified records indicated a computer generated notice of cancellation was sent to Woodruff, the employee for Woodruff responsible for insurance cancellations testified that she never received the notice.Â  After the vehicle was involved in an accident on April 25, 2001, State Farm denied coverage.Â \r\n \r\nWoodruff brought this action seeking coverage for the vehicle.Â  During the jury trial, Woodruff requested the court issue the following charge:\r\n\r\n\tState Farm must prove to you Woodruff Auto actually received State Farmâ€™s notice of the cancellation of the Hintonâ€™s insurance policy.Â  It is not enough that State Farm testifies it mailed the cancellation noticeâ€”State Farm must prove to you the cancellation notice was actually received by Woodruff Auto.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\tIf State Farm fails to prove to you (by a preponderance of the evidence) that the cancellation notice was actually received by Woodruff Auto, you must enter a verdict for Woodruff Auto.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe trial court denied Woodruffâ€™s requested charge.Â  The jury found State Farm did mail a notice of cancellation to Woodruff.Â  Thus, the cancellation was effective and there was no coverage for the vehicle at the time of the loss.Â  Woodruff appealed.Â  \r\n \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nWoodruff argues the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury that State Farm had to prove the cancellation notice was actually received by Woodruff.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n \r\nAn appellate court will not reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision regarding jury charges absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law or, when grounded in factual conclusions, is without evidentiary support.â€Â  Id.Â  The trial court is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina.Â  Frazier v. Badger, 361 S.C. 94, 101, 603 S.E.2d 587, 590 (2004).Â  â€œThe law to be charged to the jury is determined by the evidence at trial.Â  In reviewing jury charges for error, appellate courts must consider the charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.â€Â  Id.\r\nâ€œThe right to cancel a policy can be exercised only in the manner provided in the policy, and the burden of proving a valid cancellation rests on the party asserting it.â€Â  Moore v. Palmetto Bank, 238 S.C. 341, 344-45, 120 S.E.2d 231, 233 (1961). Â In Moore, the court held: \r\n \r\n\r\n\tWhere the clause applicable to the insurerâ€™s right to cancel the policy provides for the exercise of such right by mailing of notice to the insuredâ€™s address, or contains substantially similar language, the unanimous rule is that the actual receipt by the insured of such notice is not a condition precedent to a cancellation of the policy by the insurer, and the mere mailing of the letter containing a notice of cancellation is sufficient to effect a cancellation.\r\n\r\nId. at 345, 120 S.E.2d at 233.\r\nIn asserting proof of mailing alone was insufficient to effect a valid cancellation in this case, Woodruff relies on Edens v. S.C. Farm Bureau Mutual Ins. Co., 279 S.C. 377, 308 S.E.2d 670 (1983).Â  In Edens, the insurer allegedly sent the notice of cancellation by regular mail, rather than certified or registered, and no return receipt was requested.Â  The insured claimed that he never received notice of cancellation.Â  The policy did not specify the method for giving notice other than to state that cancellation by respondent could be effected by giving to the insured a five daysâ€™ written notice of cancellation.Â  The court found â€œgiving written noticeâ€ meant that the insured shall personally receive the notice in such manner that the insured becomes aware of having received it.Â  Thus, the court held actual receipt was a condition precedent to a cancellation of the policy by the insurer.Â  Id. at 380, 308 S.E.2d at 671.Â  \r\n \r\nThe difference between Moore and Edens lies simply in the language used in the policies.Â  We must therefore look to the language of the State Farm policy to determine whether the policy provided for the mailing of notice to the creditor to be sufficient to effect cancellation.\r\nâ€œInsurance policies are subject to the general rules of contract construction.â€ Â Century Indem. Co. v. Golden Hills Builders, Inc., 348 S.C. 559, 565, 561 S.E.2d 355, 358 (2002). Â The court must give policy language its plain, ordinary, and popular meaning. Â Id.Â  The court must read an insurance contract as a whole document so that one may not create an ambiguity by pointing out a single sentence or clause.Â  Schulmeyer v. State Farm Fire Cas. Co., 353 S.C. 491, 495, 579 S.E.2d 132, 134 (2003).Â  â€œThe meaning of a particular word or phrase is not determined by considering the word or phrase by itself, but by reading the policy as a whole and considering the context and subject matter of the insurance contract.â€Â  Id.\r\nIn the present case, page 6 of the policy contains a section entitled Financed Vehicles.Â  This section explains to whom the insurer may pay any loss.Â  In addition, the section provides:Â  â€œThe coverage for the creditorâ€™s interest is only valid until we terminate it.Â  . . .Â  The date of termination of the creditorâ€™s interest will be at least 10 days after the date we mail or electronically transmit the termination notice.â€Â  In a subsection of the Conditions section entitled Cancellation, found on page 34 of the policy, are the methods for cancelling the policy.Â  It discusses the methods for the insured to cancel.Â  It also provides the methods for the insured to issue the notice of cancellation: Â â€œWe may cancel your policy by written notice, mailed or delivered to your last known address.Â  The notice shall give the date cancellation is effective. . . .â€Â  In a separate paragraph, the policy provides:Â  â€œThe mailing of notice shall be sufficient proof of notice.â€Â  \r\n \r\nThe section of the policy that specifically deals with cancellation provides for mailing as proof of notice.Â  While other portions of this section seem directed more toward the insured, there is no language in the notice provision limiting its applicability to the insured and not to the creditor.Â  The notice provision does not conflict with any provision in the section involving financed vehicles.Â  Rather, the Financed Vehicles section provides the date of termination counts from the date State Farm â€œmail[s] or electronically transmit[s] the termination notice.â€Â  Thus, this section contemplates notice would be sent by mail or electronic means and counts from the date this notice is sent and not received by the creditor.Â  There is no language in the policy such as that in Edens providing for cancellation only by â€œgiving written notice.â€Â  Reading the policy as a whole, we find it provides for the mailing of notice to be sufficient proof of notice for both the insured and the creditor of a financed vehicle.Â  State Farm did not have to prove actual receipt as a condition precedent to cancellation.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in the denying Woodruffâ€™s requested charge.Â  \r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and BEATTY, JJ. concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-356","title":"Anderson County DSS v.

Â She asked the doctor if Mother had brought the child in to see her.Â  Grandmother mentioned the blue coloration on the childâ€™s legs.Â  That night, Mother called the doctorâ€™s after-hours number.Â  Mother finally brought the child to see the doctor the following day, two days after the incident.Â \r\n \r\nAccording to the doctor, the only visible injury was the red mark on the childâ€™s face.Â  However, the child was still fussy when the doctor examined him.Â  Following x-rays, the child was diagnosed with multiple leg fractures and a rib fracture.Â  The doctor, who testified as an expert, determined the injuries resulted from non-accidental trauma.Â  \r\n \r\nAdditionally, the doctor testified regarding her previous experiences treating the child.Â  The doctor first saw him when the child was five days old.Â  The doctor began treating him for reflux with medication when he was four weeks old.Â  Reflux causes children to cry and display signs of discomfort.Â  The childâ€™s reflux medication lessened his fussiness.Â \r\n \r\nThe doctor also testified she found a mark on the childâ€™s foot during an earlier checkup, but no broken bones were revealed by an x-ray.Â  She also testified Mother has done everything requested of her, attended all appointments, and asked appropriate questions.Â  \r\n \r\nFollowing the discovery of the childâ€™s bone fractures, the Department of Social Services placed the child with Grandmother and allowed Mother to stay with her also.Â  Father did not attend his scheduled appointment with the department.Â  By telephone, Father told the department that either Mother or Grandmother caused the childâ€™s injuries.Â  The child currently is in the care of Motherâ€™s father (maternal grandfather) and his current wife.Â  They both testified the child is thriving in their care.Â  Mother visits the child often, and the department developed a treatment plan for Mother.Â \r\n \r\nThe guardian ad litem reported the childâ€™s needs are being met at the maternal grandfatherâ€™s home.Â  The guardian testified she believes the parties involved know more about the situation than they are saying.Â  The guardian does not believe Mother hurt the child.Â  Mother and Grandmother each briefly testified and asserted their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.Â  Father did not appear at the trial.Â \r\n \r\nThe family court found by a preponderance of evidence that Father abused and Mother neglected the child.Â  These findings were entered into the Central Registry for Child Abuse and Neglect.Â  The maternal grandfather and his wife were given legal custody and retained physical custody of the child.Â  The family court adopted the departmentâ€™s treatment plan requiring Mother to submit to evaluations, take classes, provide child support, and understand the importance of providing for the childâ€™s physical, medical, and educational needs.Â \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn appeals from family court, the appellate court has the authority to find the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  S. C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Meek, 352 S.C. 523, 528, 575 S.E.2d 846, 848&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002).Â  However, this court is not required to ignore that the family court was in a better position to evaluate witness credibility and assign weight to testimony.Â  Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMother argues that the family court erred in finding Mother neglected the child by the preponderance of the evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 20-7-736(F) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) states:\r\n\r\n\tThe court shall not order that a child be removed from the custody of the parent or guardian unless the court finds that the allegations of the petition are supported by a preponderance of evidence including a finding that the child is an abused or neglected child as defined in Section 20-7-490 and that retention of the child in or return of the child to the home would place the child at unreasonable risk of harm affecting the childâ€™s life, physical health or safety, or mental well-being and the child cannot reasonably be protected from this harm without being removed.\r\n\r\nSection 20-7-490(2)(a) &amp; (c) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) explains that child neglect occurs if the parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the welfare of the child:\r\n\r\n\t(a)&nbsp; inflicts or allows to be inflicted upon the child physical or mental injury or engages in acts or omissions which present a substantial risk of physical or mental injury to the child . . . [or]\r\n\t(c)&nbsp; fails to supply the child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, or education as required under Article 1 of Chapter 65 of Title 59, supervision appropriate to the childâ€™s age and development, or health care though financially able to do so or offered financial or other reasonable means to do so and the failure to do so has caused or presents a substantial risk of causing physical or mental injury. . . . Â For the purpose of this chapter â€œadequate health careâ€ includes any medical or nonmedical remedial health care permitted or authorized under state law.\r\n\r\nThe family court heard testimony that a non-accidental trauma befell the child while Mother was in the shower.Â  Subsequently, Mother waited two days after discovering the childâ€™s legs were blue before taking the child to a doctor or hospital.Â  In addition, there existed other evidence of injury, including a red mark on the childâ€™s face and the child wanting to be held constantly.Â  Although Mother did bring the child to see the doctor two days following the trauma, we concur with the family court that even though Mother may have intended no harm to the child, a preponderance of the evidence shows Mother was neglectful in failing to obtain appropriate medical care.\r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; The names of the parties are deleted to conceal the minorâ€™s identity.\r\n[2]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-357","title":"Defeo v.

(White Hat) appeals the master-in-equityâ€™s order enjoining White Hat from constructing a residence on its lot.Â  On appeal, White Hat contends the master erred in finding the lot was restricted to golf course use only and excluding extrinsic evidence of the intent behind the alleged restriction.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn May 9, 1997, Ronald M. Defeo purchased Lot 22 in the Red Maple Road Subdivision of Sea Pines Plantation on Hilton Head Island.Â  A golf course surrounds Red Maple Road Subdivision.Â  The deed by which Defeo obtained Lot 22 incorporates a plat (the Plat) describing the property conveyed.Â  The Plat, recorded by the developer of Sea Pines Plantation in 1970, shows a parcel of property (the Lot) adjacent to Lot 22 labeled only as â€œRESERVED FOR FUTURE USE FOR GOLF COURSE.â€Â \r\n \r\nOn January 10, 2000, Community Services Associates, Inc., and Sea Pines Company, Inc., the successors-in-interest to the developer of Sea Pines Plantation, transferred the Lot to Sea Pines Land Company.Â  Sea Pines Land Company subsequently changed its name to White Hat and prepared to build a residence on the Lot.Â  In response, Defeo filed the present action seeking to enjoin White Hatâ€™s use of the Lot.[1] \r\n \r\nAt trial, Francis Guscio, Jr., formerly the land control officer for the developer of Sea Pines Plantation and currently an owner and officer of White Hat, attempted to testify as to why the term â€œreservedâ€ was used on the Plat, rather than the term â€œrestricted.â€Â  The master refused to allow the testimony, holding â€œ[f]irsthand knowledge of how that language got put on that plat is what would be required.â€Â  White Hat proffered Guscioâ€™s testimony.Â  White Hat also proffered the expert testimony of George Richardson Wieters, a real estate attorney and a licensed title insurance agent, as to whether the term â€œRESERVED FOR FUTURE USE FOR GOLF COURSEâ€ was ambiguous.Â  The master excluded the testimony on the ground it constituted a legal conclusion.\r\n \r\nSubsequently, the master issued an order finding the language on the Plat unambiguously restricted the Lot to golf course use only.Â  As a result, the master permanently enjoined White Hatâ€™s proposed residential use of the Lot.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAn action to enforce restrictive covenants by injunction is in equity.â€Â  Seabrook Island Prop. Owners Assâ€™n v. Marshland Trust, Inc., 358 S.C. 655, 661, 596 S.E.2d 380, 383&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œIn equitable actions, the appellate court may review the record and make findings of fact in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Grosshuesch v. Cramer, 367 S.C. 1, 4, 623 S.E.2d 833, 834&nbsp;(2005).Â  However, the appellate court is not required to ignore the findings of the master, because he was in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses.Â  Siau v. Kassel,&nbsp;369 S.C. 631, 638, 632 S.E.2d 888, 892&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).\r\nA decision whether to grant or deny an injunction is ordinarily left to the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  County of Richland v. Simpkins, 348 S.C. 664, 668, 560 S.E.2d 902, 904 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when there is an error of law or a factual conclusion which is without evidentiary support. Lee v. Suess, 318 S.C. 283, 285, 457 S.E.2d 344, 345 (1995).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.&nbsp; The Plat\r\nWhite Hat contends the master erred in finding the Plat unambiguously restricted use of the Lot to golf course purposes only.[2] Â We disagree.\r\nâ€œRestrictive covenants are contractual in nature.â€Â  Seabrook Island Prop. Ownersâ€™ Assâ€™n v. Berger, 365 S.C. 234, 239, 616 S.E.2d 431, 434 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  â€œThe language of a restrictive covenant is to be construed according to the plain and ordinary meaning attributed to it at the time of execution.â€ Hardy v. Aiken, 369 S.C. 160, 166, 631 S.E.2d 539, 542&nbsp;(2006). Â â€œA restrictive covenant is ambiguous when its terms are reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation.â€Â Â  Id. at 165, 631 S.E.2d at 541. \r\n \r\nâ€œA restriction on the use of property must be created in express terms or by plain and unmistakable implication, and all such restrictions are to be strictly construed, with all doubts resolved in favor of the free use of the property.â€Â  Hamilton v. CCM, Inc., 274 S.C. 152, 157, 263 S.E.2d 378, 380&nbsp;(1980) (citation omitted).Â  However, â€œ[t]he rule of strict construction governing restrictive covenants does not preclude their enforcement.Â  A restrictive covenant will be enforced if the covenant expresses the partyâ€™s intent or purpose, and this rule will not be used to defeat the clear express language of the covenant.â€Â  Sea Pines Plantation Co. v. Wells, 294 S.C. 266, 270, 363 S.E.2d 891, 894 (1987).\r\nRestrictive covenants may be created several ways, the most common of which are: Â (1) by deed; (2) by declaration; and (3) by implication from a general plan or scheme of development.Â  Queenâ€™s Grant II Horizontal Prop. Regime v. Greenwood Dev. Corp., 368 S.C. 342, 362, 628 S.E.2d 902, 913&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).Â  When a deed describes land as shown on a certain plat, such plat becomes a part of the deed.Â  Carolina Land Co. v. Bland, 265 S.C. 98, 105, 217 S.E.2d 16, 19&nbsp;(1975); Bennett v. Investors Title Ins. Co., 370 S.C. 578, 594, 635 S.E.2d 649, 657&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).Â  \r\n \r\nAt issue in this case, is the term â€œreserveâ€ as used in the Plat.Â  â€œReserveâ€ means â€œ[s]omething retained or stored for future use.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1334 (8th ed. 2004).Â  White Hat concentrates on the word â€œreservedâ€ and contends the developer, who recorded the Plat, used this language to â€œreserveâ€ his right to develop the Lot for golf course use.Â  However, White Hat also asserts this reservation did not affect the developerâ€™s right to use the Lot for other purposes, such as for residential use.Â  While we agree the developer clearly intended to reserve his right to develop the Lot for golf course purposes, nothing in the phrase conveys a similar intent to develop the Lot for non-golf course use.[3]Â  Accordingly, we hold the clear, unambiguous language of the Plat restricts the Lot to golf course use only.Â  \r\n \r\nII. Extrinsic Evidence\r\nWhite Hat argues the master erred in disallowing: Â (1) Guscioâ€™s testimony of why the developer used the term â€œreservedâ€ as opposed to â€œrestricted;â€ and (2) Wietersâ€™s opinion as to whether the term â€œreservedâ€ was ambiguous. Â We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe admission and rejection of testimony is largely within the trial judgeâ€™s sound discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing that the trial court abused its discretion or its decision was controlled by an error of law.â€Â  Mishoe v. QHG of Lake City, Inc., 366 S.C. 195, 203, 621 S.E.2d 363, 367&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005), cert. denied (Jan. 18, 2007).\r\nInitially, we find the master correctly excluded Guscioâ€™s and Wietersâ€™s testimony as extrinsic evidence. â€œWhere the language used in a restrictive covenant is unambiguous, there is no room for construction and the language must be enforced in accordance with its plain meaning.â€ Heape v. Broxton, 293 S.C. 343, 345, 360 S.E.2d 157, 158 (Ct. App. 1987); see C.A.N. Enters., Inc. v. S.C. Health &amp; Human Servs. Fin. Commâ€™n,&nbsp;296 S.C. 373, 377-78, 373 S.E.2d 584, 586&nbsp;(1988) (â€œExtrinsic evidence giving the contract a different meaning from that indicated by its plain terms is inadmissible.â€); see also Moser v. Gosnell, 334 S.C. 425, 431, 513 S.E.2d 123, 126&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1999) (stating when a covenant is clear and unambiguous, the court looks only to the language of the covenant and not to extrinsic evidence to determine the intent of the parties).Â  \r\n \r\nMoreover, White Hat contends the master should have allowed Guscioâ€™s testimony under the business records exception to the hearsay rule, Rule 803(6) of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence.[4]Â  However, White Hat never laid a proper foundation for the application of this exception. Â Nor did he argue this exception to the master.Â  Accordingly, we are unable to determine whether Guscioâ€™s testimony would lie within this exception and decline to rule on the merits.Â  See Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (â€œIt is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.â€); Ellie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 103, 594 S.E.2d 485, 498 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œWithout an initial ruling by the trial court, a reviewing court simply would not be able to evaluate whether the trial court committed error.â€); see also Webb v. CSX Transp., Inc., 364 S.C. 639, 655, 615 S.E.2d 440, 449&nbsp;(2005) (â€œIt is the appellantâ€™s burden to present a sufficient record for appellate review.â€).\r\nAdditionally, Guscioâ€™s proffered testimony was almost identical to Guscioâ€™s answer to a previous question, to which Defeo failed to object.Â  Thus, even if the master erred in excluding the testimony, any error would be harmless given the testimony would have been cumulative. Â See Smith v. Winningham, 252 S.C. 462, 467, 166 S.E.2d 825, 827 (1969) (â€œAlleged error in the exclusion of offered testimony is of no avail if the same testimony or testimony to the same effect had been or was afterwards allowed to be given by the witness.â€); S.C. Depâ€™t of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp. v. Galbreath, 315 S.C. 82, 86, 431 S.E.2d 625, 628 (Ct. App. 1993)(stating, â€œ[e]ven if the trial court erred in excluding evidence, there is no reversible error where the testimony would have been cumulativeâ€).\r\nFurther, Wietersâ€™s testimony, though based upon his analysis as a title examiner, amounted to a legal conclusion.Â  Accordingly, the master did not abuse his discretion in excluding it.Â  See Dawkins v.

Karoly, Sr., along with\r\n  other family members (collectively â€œAppellantsâ€) appeal the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  order dismissing all claims except their breach of contract claim against Respondents\r\n  Calvin C. Shankle (â€œShankleâ€) and Weber Funeral Homes, Inc (â€œWeberâ€).Â \r\n  In their brief, Appellants contend the circuit court erred in dismissing their\r\n  negligence per se claim pursuant to the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the\r\n  United States Constitution and the doctrine of res judicata.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn July 21,\r\n  2002, John P. Karoly, Sr., (â€œthe decedentâ€) passed away at the Medical\r\n  University of South Carolina.Â  On the date of the decedentâ€™s death, one of the\r\n  decedentâ€™s sons, John P. Karoly, Jr., contracted with Weber and Service\r\n  Corporation International on behalf of the estate for the removal, preparation,\r\n  and transportation of the decedentâ€™s body from South Carolina to Pennsylvania. Â Weber, in turn, contracted with Carolina Funeral Services, Inc., for the\r\n  removal, preparation, care, embalming, and transportation of the decedentâ€™s\r\n  corpse from South Carolina to Pennsylvania.Â  Upon arrival in Pennsylvania, the\r\n  family was to be permitted to identify, view, and pay their last respects prior\r\n  to cremation of the decedent.\r\nAfter receiving\r\n  the decedentâ€™s remains, Carolina Funeral Services assigned Stephen Sumner to\r\n  perform the embalming and preparation.Â  However, Sumner either did not embalm\r\n  or failed to properly embalm the decedentâ€™s body. Â When the decedentâ€™s body\r\n  arrived in Pennsylvania, the corpse was in an advanced state of decomposition.Â \r\n  This precluded the family from conducting a viewing of the body, and local\r\n  friends and family were not able to pay their respects.\r\nOn September 30,\r\n  2004, Appellants filed a complaint in Pennsylvania.Â  The Pennsylvania Complaint\r\n  included the following causes of action against Weber and Shankle:Â  (1)\r\n  intentional/negligent mishandling of a corpse; (2) negligence per se based on\r\n  18 Pa. C.S.A. Â§ 5510 (1972); (3) breach of contract; and (4)\r\n  intentional/negligent infliction of emotional distress.Â  On January 24, 2005,\r\n  the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, entered an order dismissing\r\n  all but one of Appellantsâ€™ claims; the only claim that remained was the breach\r\n  of contract claim.Â  With regard to Appellantsâ€™ claim for intentional infliction\r\n  of emotional distress, the court rejected Weber and Shankleâ€™s argument that Pennsylvania law does not recognize that cause of action.Â  Nevertheless, the court held\r\n  that Appellants had failed to state any facts to support a claim that Weber and\r\n  Shankle intentionally mistreated the decedentâ€™s corpse.Â  Further, finding that Pennsylvania law does not permit recovery for the negligent mishandling of a corpse, the\r\n  court dismissed, without leave to amend, any and all allegations regarding the\r\n  negligence of Weber and Shankle.Â  Finally, the court dismissed the negligence per\r\n  se cause of action because 18 Pa. C.S.A. Â§ 5510 only prohibits intentional acts.\r\n  Â Thus, the court reasoned that â€œ[b]y its nature, negligence cannot flow from an\r\n  intentional act.â€Â  Appellants neither appealed nor moved to alter or amend the order.Â \r\n  Appellants subsequently dismissed without prejudice their remaining breach of\r\n  contract claim still pending in Pennsylvania.\r\nOn July 20,\r\n  2005, Appellants filed the instant action in South Carolina. Â The South\r\n  Carolina Amended Complaint included the same causes of action and is nearly\r\n  identical to the Pennsylvania Complaint, except the negligence per se cause of\r\n  action was predicated on South Carolina Code section 16-17-600 (Supp. 2005).\r\nFollowing Weber\r\n  and Shankleâ€™s Motion to Dismiss,[1] filed December 2, 2005, the circuit court allowed the breach of contract cause\r\n  of action to continue, but dismissed the other causes of action under the\r\n  theory of res judicata and the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United\r\n  States Constitution.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nUnder\r\n  Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, a defendant may move to dismiss based upon a plaintiffâ€™s failure\r\n  to allege facts constituting a cause of action.Â  Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 527, 511 S.E.2d 69, 73 (1999).Â  The trial judge may dismiss the\r\n  claim if the defendant demonstrates the plaintiff has failed â€œto state facts\r\n  sufficient to constitute a cause of actionâ€ in the pleadings filed with the\r\n  court.Â  Williams v. Condon, 347 S.C. 227, 232-33, 553 S.E.2d 496, 499\r\n  (Ct. App. 2001) (quoting Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP).Â  When considering the motion to\r\n  dismiss for failure to state a claim, the trial court must base its ruling\r\n  solely upon the allegations made on the face of the complaint.Â  Baird,\r\n  333 S.C. at 527, 511 S.E.2d at 73; Stiles v. Onorato, 318 S.C. 297, 300,\r\n  457 S.E.2d 601, 602 (1995).Â  If the facts and inferences drawn from the facts\r\n  alleged in the complaint would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory,\r\n  then the grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state\r\n  a claim is improper.Â  Brown v. Leverette, 291 S.C. 364, 366, 353 S.E.2d\r\n  697, 698 (1987); McCormick v. England, 328 S.C. 627, 632-33, 494 S.E.2d\r\n  431, 433 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  The facts and inferences alleged in the complaint\r\n  are viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.Â  Toussaint v. Ham,\r\n  292 S.C. 415, 416, 357 S.E.2d 8, 9 (1987); Cowart v. Poore, 337 S.C.\r\n  359, 364, 523 S.E.2d 182, 184-85 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants\r\n  contend the circuit court erred in dismissing their negligence per se cause of\r\n  action against Shankle and Weber based on the Full Faith and Credit Clause and\r\n  the doctrine of res judicata because their claim is based on the South Carolina statute which is different from their claim based on the Pennsylvania\r\n  statute.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Full Faith and Credit\r\n  Clause of the United States Constitution provides that â€œFull Faith and Credit\r\n  shall be given in each State to the . . . judicial Proceedings of every other\r\n  State.â€Â U.S. Const. art. IV, Â§ 1.Â \r\n  The thrust of the clause is that courts of one state must give such force and\r\n  effect to a foreign judgment as the judgment would\r\n  receive in the issuing state. Â Â Purdie v. Smalls, 293\r\n  S.C. 216, 219-20, 359 S.E.2d 306, 308 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  As a result, â€œa foreign\r\n  judgment which is regular on its face generally may not be collaterally\r\n  attacked.â€Â Bankers Trust Co. v.\r\n    Braten, 317 S.C. 547, 550, 455 S.E.2d 199, 200 (Ct. App. 1995).\r\nAs the Appellants\r\n  concede, in order to determine the res judicata effect of the Pennsylvania\r\n  order upon the present action, this court must decide whether Appellants would\r\n  be precluded from pursuing their claims in the courts of Pennsylvania. Â In\r\n  Pennsylvania, as in South Carolina, â€œ[i]t is hornbook law that when a final\r\n  judgment on the merits has been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction,\r\n  the doctrine of res judicata will bar any future suit on the same cause of\r\n  action between the same parties.â€ Â Glynn v. Glynn, 789 A. 2d 242, 249 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2001). Â Under Pennsylvania law:\r\n\r\n  Res\r\n    judicata encompasses two related, yet distinct principles: technical res judicata\r\n    and collateral estoppel. Â Henion v. Workersâ€™ Comp Appeal Bd. (Firpo &amp;\r\n      Sons, Inc.), 776 A.2d. 362 (Pa. Cmwlth., 2001). Â Technical res judicata\r\n    provides that where a final judgment on the merits exists, a future lawsuit on\r\n    the same cause of action is precluded. Â Id. Â Collateral estoppel acts to\r\n    foreclose litigation in a subsequent action where issues of law or fact were\r\n    actually litigated and necessary to a previous final judgment. Â Id.\r\n  Technical\r\n    res judicata requires the coalescence of four factors: (1) identity of the\r\n    thing sued upon or for; (2) identity of the causes of action; (3) identity of\r\n    the persons or parties to the action; and (4) identity of the quality or\r\n    capacity of the parties suing or being sued. Â Id. Â Res judicata applies\r\n    to claims that were actually litigated as well as those matters that should\r\n    have been litigated. Â Id. Â Generally, causes of action are identical\r\n    when the subject matter and the ultimate issues are the same in both the old\r\n    and new proceedings. Â Id.\r\n  Similarly,\r\n    collateral estoppel bars a subsequent lawsuit where (1) an issue decided in a\r\n    prior action is identical to one presented in a later action, (2) the prior\r\n    action resulted in a final judgment on the merits, (3) the party against whom\r\n    collateral estoppel is asserted was a party to the prior action, or is in\r\n    privity with a party to the prior actions, and (4) the party against whom\r\n    collateral estoppel is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the\r\n    issue in the prior action. Â Rue v. K-Mart Corp., 552 Pa. 13, 713 A. 2d\r\n    82 (1998).\r\n\r\nStilp v. Commonwealth,\r\n  910 A. 2d 775, 783-84 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2006).\r\nMoreover,\r\n  â€œan order of dismissal â€˜with prejudiceâ€™ made upon agreement or stipulation of\r\n  the parties before trial, or by the court after trial, is a judgment on the merits\r\n  and operates as res judicata of the issues addressed in the case, thus barring\r\n  a subsequent suit on the same cause of action.â€ Â Waynik v. Suhyda, 22 Pa. D. &amp; C.2d 208, 213 (Pa.Ct.Com.Pl.1960). Â Further,\r\n  a dismissal upon preliminary objections is a final order which becomes res\r\n  judicata if not timely appealed. Â U.S. Natâ€™l Bank in Johnstown v.\r\n    Johnson, 487 A.2d 809, 813 (Pa. 1985).\r\nIn\r\n  essence, Appellants contend the Pennsylvania court did not make specific\r\n  factual findings or issue any ruling concerning the South Carolina statute in\r\n  question. Â Thus, they argue, the circuit court erred in holding the issue of\r\n  negligence per se based on the South Carolina statute was fully and fairly\r\n  decided in the Pennsylvania action. Â While the Pennsylvania court did\r\n  not base its dismissal of the negligence per se cause of action on our statute,\r\n  it did conclude that the Pennsylvania statute, like our statute, only prohibits\r\n  intentional, as opposed to negligent conduct, and that the Appellants had not alleged\r\n  that Weber and Shankle engaged in intentional conduct. Â The court further\r\n  concluded that â€œ[b]y its nature, negligence cannot flow from an intentional\r\n  act.â€ Â Comparing the language of the two statutes, our statute reads in\r\n  relevant part as follows:\r\n\r\n  (A) It is\r\n    unlawful for a person willfully and knowingly, and without proper legal\r\n    authority to:\r\n  (1) destroy or\r\n    damage the remains of a deceased human being;\r\n  (2) . . .; or\r\n  (3) desecrate human remains.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-600 (Supp. 2005).\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Pennsylvania statute reads\r\n  in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Except as authorized by law, a person who treats a corpse in a way\r\n      that he knows would outrage ordinary family sensibilities commits a misdemeanor\r\n      of the second degree.[2]\r\n  \r\n\r\n18 Pa. C.S.A. Â§ 5510 (1972).\r\nAlthough the two\r\n  statutes read differently, the conduct both statutes prescribe is the intentional\r\n  or willful abuse of a corpse. Â Inasmuch as the Pennsylvania court held Weber\r\n  and Shankle had not alleged an intentional abuse of the decedentâ€™s body, and\r\n  further held as a matter of law that negligence cannot be predicated on an\r\n  intentional act, we are constrained to hold under principles of res judicata\r\n  and collateral estoppel[3] that the circuit court did not err in dismissing Appellantsâ€™ negligence per se\r\n  cause of action.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  find Appellants abandoned their issues on appeal relating to the dismissal of all\r\n  of their causes of action except their claim based on negligence per se.Â  Based\r\n  on the above reasoning, we conclude the circuit court did not err in dismissing\r\n  Appellantsâ€™ negligence per se cause of action.Â  Accordingly, the decision of\r\n  the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY and WILLIAMS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â The motion to dismiss, in addition to arguing res\r\n  judicata and collateral estoppel, also asserts that â€œ[b]oth [statesâ€™] statutes\r\n  relied upon by [Appellants] to support their claims for negligence per se\r\n  prohibit intentional, as opposed to negligent, acts. Â Because negligence cannot\r\n  flow from an intentional act, the statutes relied upon provide no basis for a\r\n  claim of negligence per se.â€\r\n[2] Â Arguably, one could assert this statute permits\r\n  recovery based on gross negligence. Â However, Appellants did not appeal the\r\n  Pennsylvania courtâ€™s holding that the statute prohibits only intentional acts.Â \r\n  That holding, therefore, becomes res judicata.\r\n[3] Â This court may affirm a decision of the trial court\r\n  based on any ground appearing in the record.Â  Rule 220(c), SCACR. Â Moreover,\r\n  collateral estoppel was discussed during oral argument before this court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-361","title":"Muckenfuss v.

Clingman, of\r\n          Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Jane\r\n  Oâ€™Keefe (Daughter) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order affirming the probate\r\n  courtâ€™s orders appointing third parties as Pauline Muckenfussâ€™s (Motherâ€™s)\r\n  guardian and conservator. Â Daughter argues the probate court failed to make the\r\n  necessary finding of good cause to bypass her statutorily-designated priority\r\n  as Motherâ€™s attorney-in-fact.Â  Because we find the probate court failed to make\r\n  the requisite finding and the circuit court erred in affirming the probate\r\n  courtâ€™s orders, we reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this\r\n  opinion.\r\nFACTS\r\nMother is a widow who lives at an\r\n  assisted-living facility, the Savannah House in Charleston.Â  In addition to\r\n  Daughter, Mother has three sons: Thomas (Tommy), Wendell, and Paul.Â  Daughter\r\n  was designated as Motherâ€™s power of attorney in October 2002.Â  Mother was\r\n  admitted to the Savannah House in November 2002, following hospitalization for\r\n  mental illness.\r\nOn\r\n  January 29, 2004, Wendell and Tommy petitioned the probate court to find Mother\r\n  incapacitated and to appoint a guardian and conservator.Â  The probate court\r\n  conducted a hearing on September 15, 2004.Â  At trial, Dr. Susan Hardesty of the\r\n  Medical University of South Carolina testified Mother needed a guardian and\r\n  conservator. Â Dr. Hardesty stated to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that\r\n  Motherâ€™s capacity did not allow her to manage her resources.Â  \r\nThe hearing also included testimony regarding the relationship\r\n  between the children and the affect the friction between the siblings had on\r\n  Mother.Â  Dr. Hardesty testified that Mother felt paranoid regarding her\r\n  childrenâ€™s roles.Â  Dr. Hardesty was not certain if having one of Motherâ€™s\r\n  children serve as a guardian or conservator would aggravate Motherâ€™s condition\r\n  because Motherâ€™s reaction would be dependent on her paranoid ideation at the\r\n  time.Â  Additionally, Dr. Hardesty stated any suggestions by Mother regarding\r\n  who should be the guardian or conservator should not be given weight by the\r\n  court.Â  \r\nThe guardian ad litem testified Mother was concerned over the conflict\r\n  between her children.Â  The guardian believed a third party serving as guardian\r\n  and conservator would be in the best interest of everyone given the infighting\r\n  between Daughter and the sons.Â  The guardian believed a third party could\r\n  circumvent current communication problems, but the animosity between Daughter\r\n  and the sons will likely remain regardless of whether a third party is used.Â  The\r\n  guardian testified he had no problem with the way Daughter provided care for\r\n  Mother and handled Motherâ€™s finances. \r\nThe friction between the siblings was illustrated by trial\r\n  testimony.Â  Paul testified he had to call the police department to locate\r\n  Mother after Mother moved to the Savannah House because no one informed him of the\r\n  move.Â  Paul thought Daughter had done a good job providing for Mother; however,\r\n  he believed having a third party involved in Motherâ€™s care would be best for\r\n  everyone. \r\nWendell also requested a third partyâ€™s involvement in order to\r\n  reduce the infighting in the family and minimize Motherâ€™s paranoia towards her\r\n  children.Â  Regarding the friction, Wendell testified Daughter would not allow\r\n  him to visit Mother privately on one occasion.Â  Wendell further testified Daughterâ€™s\r\n  husband followed Wendell to the airport and behaved suspiciously.Â  \r\nAccording\r\n  to Daughter, she gets along well with Tommy and Paul, but has difficulty with Wendell.Â \r\n  Daughter testified she did not tell her brothers she had power of attorney because\r\n  Mother requested she not tell them.Â  Regarding Motherâ€™s relocation to the Savannah\r\n  House, Daughter explained she notified the oldest brother, Tommy, and assumed\r\n  he would notify the other two brothers.Â  Over the three years prior to the\r\n  hearing, Daughter testified she has spoken with or seen Paul and Tommy numerous\r\n  times, but only contacted Wendell twice.Â  \r\nIn response to Wendellâ€™s statement that Daughter refused to allow\r\n  him to see Mother, Daughter stated she suggested Wendell not meet with Mother\r\n  alone because Mother had not seen Wendell in years and it would be too shocking\r\n  for Mother.Â  According to Daughter, while Wendell was speaking to Mother that\r\n  day, a Savannah House employee informed Daughter that Motherâ€™s whole body was\r\n  shaking.Â  \r\nThe aforementioned Savannah House employee, Patty Daniel, testified\r\n  she had no concerns over Daughterâ€™s handling of Mother.Â  Daniel and Daughter\r\n  both stated they believe the system in place prior to trial, with Daughter\r\n  serving as attorney-in-fact, worked fine.Â  Daniel acknowledged that the only\r\n  problem she saw under the system was Mother gets very agitated by Wendellâ€™s\r\n  phone conversations.Â  Daniel believed it is easier to deal with a family member\r\n  than a third party.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  October 19, 2004, the probate court ordered third parties Seniors Choice and\r\n  First Southeast Fiduciary and Trust Services, Incorporated to serve as Motherâ€™s\r\n  guardian and conservator, respectively.Â  Daughter appealed the orders to the\r\n  circuit court.Â  On May 23, 2006, the circuit court affirmed the probate court.Â \r\n  After a hearing, the circuit court held the probate court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion in finding that Motherâ€™s best interest would be served by appointing\r\n  third parties as guardian and conservator.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œ[T]he\r\n  determination of the standard of review by an appellate court of matters\r\n  originating in the probate court is controlled by whether the cause of action\r\n  is at law or in equity.â€ Â Dean v. Kilgore, 313 S.C. 257, 259, 437 S.E.2d\r\n  154, 155 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  â€œTo make this determination, the appellate court\r\n  must look to the essential character of the cause of action alleged by the\r\n  petitioners in the court below.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œPersons of unsound mind, like\r\n  infants, are under the special protection of the courts of equity with respect\r\n  to their persons, property, and legal transactions.â€Â  Shepard v. First Am.\r\n    Mortgage Co.,&nbsp;289 S.C. 516, 518, 347 S.E.2d 118, 119&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1986); see Dean, 313 S.C. at 259, 437 S.E.2d at 155 (finding petition to\r\n  remove personal representative is in equity); Gaddy v. Douglass, 359\r\n  S.C. 329, 333, 597 S.E.2d 12, 14 (Ct. App. 2004) (recognizing an action to set aside a power of attorney and an\r\n  instrument revoking a power of attorney on the ground of a lack of mental\r\n  capacity sounds in equity). Â If the\r\n  probate proceeding is equitable in nature, an appellate court may make factual\r\n  findings according to its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  In\r\n    re Howard, 315 S.C. 356, 362, 434 S.E.2d 254, 257-58 (1993).Â  Therefore,\r\n  â€œ[b]eing an equity case, the circuit court, sitting as an appellate court, had\r\n  jurisdiction to make findings in accordance with its own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Eagles v. S.C. Natâ€™l Bank, 301 S.C.\r\n  402, 408, 392 S.E.2d 187, 191 (Ct. App. 1990).\r\nThe\r\n  two-judge rule applies to appeals from the probate court to the circuit court.Â  Dean, 313 S.C. at 259-60, 437 S.E.2d at 155.Â  Pursuant to this rule, the\r\n  standard of review in equity cases in which the circuit court concurs with the\r\n  probate court is whether there is any evidence which reasonably supports the\r\n  findings of the court below.Â  Id. at 260, 437 S.E.2d at 155-56.\r\nThe\r\n  specific choice of who should serve as guardian and conservator is decided\r\n  under the probate courtâ€™s discretion.Â  â€œThe matter of a selection of a guardian\r\n  is within the discretion of the court, and the appellate court ordinarily will\r\n  not interfere unless a clear abuse of discretion is shown.â€Â  39 C.J.S. Guardian\r\n    and Ward Â§ 28 (2003).Â  â€œSubject to statutory\r\n  restrictions, the selection of a guardian is a matter committed largely to the\r\n  discretion of the appointing court, whose decision will only be interfered with\r\n  on appeal in the case of a clear abuse of discretion.â€Â  39 Am. Jur. 2d Guardian\r\n    and Ward Â§ 40 (1999).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  relevant statutes in this case, sections 62-5-311 and 62-5-410 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code, indicate the appointing court has discretion by using the\r\n  phrases â€œmay be appointed guardianâ€ and â€œthe court may appoint . . . as\r\n  conservator,â€ respectively.Â  The appointing court will not be overturned absent an\r\n  abuse of discretion. Â See Patterson v. Cook, 288\r\n  S.C. 220, 221, 341 S.E.2d 782, 782 (1986) (interpreting an appointment statute\r\n  without priority guidelines).Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nDaughter argues the\r\n  probate court, and in turn the circuit court, erred by failing to make a\r\n  finding of good cause when appointing third parties as Motherâ€™s guardian and\r\n  conservator because Daughter had statutory priority as Motherâ€™s attorney-in-fact.Â \r\n  We agree.\r\nSection 62-5-311 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code provides the order of priority for guardian appointees,\r\n  stating:\r\n\r\n  (A) Any competent\r\n    person or a suitable institution may be appointed guardian of an incapacitated\r\n    person.\r\n        \r\n    (B) Subject to a finding of good cause by the court, persons who are not\r\n    disqualified have priority for appointment as guardian in the following order:\r\n  . . .\r\n  (2) an attorney in fact appointed by the incapacitated person\r\n    pursuant to Section 62-5-501,\r\n    whose authority includes powers relating to the person of the incapacitated\r\n    person;\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 62-5-311 (Supp. 2006)(emphasis added). \r\nSection\r\n  62-5-410 of the South Carolina Code provides the order of priority for\r\n  conservator appointees, stating:\r\n\r\n  (a) The court may\r\n    appoint an individual, or a corporation with general power to serve as trustee,\r\n    as conservator of the estate of a protected person. The following are entitled\r\n    to consideration for appointment in the order listed:\r\n  . . . \r\n  (3) an attorney in fact appointed by such protected person\r\n    pursuant to Â§ 62- 5-501;\r\n  . . . \r\n  \r\n    (b) . . . Â The court, for good cause, may pass over a person having priority\r\n      and appoint a person having less priority or no priority.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. 62-5-410 (1987 &amp; Supp. 2006)(emphasis added).\r\nGood\r\n  cause is defined as â€œ[a] legally sufficient reason.Â  Good cause is often the\r\n  burden placed on the litigant . . . to show why a request should be granted or\r\n  excused.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 235 (8th ed. 2004).Â  \r\nBased on the language of the applicable statutes, we believe\r\n  before a probate court bypasses a person with a statutory priority for the\r\n  appointment of a conservator or guardian, it must make a finding of good cause\r\n  by articulating its reasons for such a finding.Â Â  See Hodges v.\r\n    Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000) (If a statuteâ€™s language is plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear\r\n  meaning, then â€œthe rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the\r\n  court has no right to impose another meaning.â€); McClanahan v. Richland\r\n    County Council, 350 S.C. 433, 438, 567 S.E.2d 240, 242 (2002)(â€œAll rules of\r\n  statutory construction are subservient to the one that legislative intent must\r\n  prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used.â€); cf. Aycock\r\n    v. Aycock, 284 S.C. 193, 195, 324 S.E.2d 650, 651 (Ct. App. 1984)\r\n  (reversing award of unallocated alimony and support to wife, who had custody of\r\n  children, where family courtâ€™s order gave no cause or reason for award where\r\n  applicable statute required that â€œif an award of unallocated alimony and\r\n  support payments is to be made, there must first be a finding of fact that\r\n  there is good cause to make this award rather than allocated awardsâ€). \r\nIn the instant case, the probate court passed over Daughterâ€™s\r\n  statutory priority without a specific finding of good cause in the orders\r\n  appointing a third-party guardian and a third-party conservator.Â  In its\r\n  orders, the probate court acknowledged that Mother had executed a durable power\r\n  of attorney in favor of Daughter.Â  Without explanation the court cancelled\r\n  Daughterâ€™s power of attorney and found that it was â€œnecessary and desirableâ€ to\r\n  appoint a third-party guardian and conservator. \r\nFrom all indications in the record, Daughter had taken good care\r\n  of Mother.Â  Although the probate court indicated in its order that Mother\r\n  wanted a third party appointed because of the friction between her children, the\r\n  evidence includes testimony of Dr. Hardesty that any suggestions by Mother\r\n  regarding who should serve as her guardian and conservator should be given limited\r\n  weight if any. Â Admittedly, the record does include testimony of friction\r\n  between the siblings; however, the probate courtâ€™s mere acknowledgment of the\r\n  familyâ€™s divisiveness does not qualify as a finding of good cause.[1]Â  \r\nAs pointed out in the circuit courtâ€™s order, the probate\r\n  court was undoubtedly cognizant of the statutory priorities.Â  The probate\r\n  court, nevertheless, did not comply with the requirements of the statutes in\r\n  bypassing Daughter without articulating its reasons why a third party would\r\n  better serve as a guardian and conservator.Â  Because the probate court failed\r\n  to make the requisite finding of good cause, we remand this case to the probate\r\n  court for a finding consistent with sections 62-5-311 and 62-5-410.Â  See Act No. 483, 1990 S.C. Acts 2152 (amending section 62-5-311 to require a\r\n  finding of good cause and stating â€œrelating to guardians, so as to provide for\r\n  additional persons who may be appointed as guardian subject to a finding of\r\n  good cause instead of the courtâ€™s discretionâ€); 21 S.C. Jur. Guardian and\r\n    Conservator Â§ 15 (1993 &amp; Supp. 2006) (â€œAbsent a contrary finding of\r\n  good cause by the court, competent persons qualified to serve as guardians must\r\n  be selectedâ€ pursuant to the prioritized list of qualified persons under\r\n  sections 62-5-311 and 62-5-410.). Â On remand, the probate court should make specific\r\n  findings based on the current record and should not consider additional\r\n  testimony or evidence.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the decision of the circuit court is \r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.[2]\r\nHUFF,\r\n  BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n  \r\n\r\n[1]Â Â  At oral argument, the parties urged this court to\r\n  definitively rule on whether friction or dissension between family members is\r\n  sufficient to constitute good cause to bypass a person with a statutory priority.Â \r\n  In light of the probate courtâ€™s failure to make a specific finding regarding\r\n  good cause, we do not believe this case presents the appropriate factual\r\n  circumstances for this court to make that determination.Â  Therefore, we decline\r\n  to rule on that issue.\r\n[2]Â Â  In reaching our decision, we have considered the\r\n  case law from other jurisdictions that was submitted by the parties.Â  We,\r\n  however, conclude that the statutes and appellate decisions from this state\r\n  provide a sufficient basis for our decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
