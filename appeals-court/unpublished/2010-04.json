Michael Baxley, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2010-UP-225\r\n  Submitted March 1, 2010 â€“ Filed April 1,\r\n2010Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Bonnie Travaglio Hunt, of North Charleston, for Appellant.Â  \r\n        Lovic A. Brooks, III, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCURETON, A.J.:Â  Loretta C. Novak filed suit against\r\n  the respondents, alleging wrongful termination in violation of a clear mandate\r\n  of public policy and civil conspiracy.Â  The circuit court dismissed her\r\n  complaint for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of\r\n  action.[1]\r\n  Specifically, the circuit court found the respondents neither violated the\r\n  criminal law by firing Novak nor required Novak to violate the law as part of\r\n  her employment.Â  \r\nNovak appeals\r\n  the circuit court's dismissal of her complaint for wrongful termination in\r\n  violation of public policy, arguing the trial court erred in finding she failed\r\n  to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.Â  We disagree.Â  We modify\r\n  the circuit court's order as described below and affirm[2] the dismissal.Â  \r\nInitially,\r\n  we recognize Novak argues the novel issue in her complaint rendered it\r\n  ineligible for dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).Â  We decline to address this\r\n  argument because it is not preserved for our review. Â See Wilder\r\n    Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (&quot;It is\r\n  axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must\r\n  have been raised to and ruled upon by the [circuit court] to be preserved for\r\n  appellate review.&quot;).Â  \r\nWith\r\n  regard to the merits of the dismissal, a defendant may offer the defense that\r\n  the plaintiff has &quot;fail[ed] to state facts sufficient to constitute a\r\n  cause of action&quot; by motion instead of in a responsive pleading.Â  Rule\r\n  12(b), SCRCP.Â  However, the defendant must make this motion before pleading.Â  Id.Â \r\n  In deciding whether the circuit court properly granted a motion to dismiss\r\n  pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, the appellate court must consider whether the\r\n  complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, states any\r\n  valid claim for relief.Â  Gentry v. Yonce, 337 S.C. 1, 5, 522 S.E.2d 137,\r\n  139 (1999).Â  If the facts and inferences raised by the complaint would entitle\r\n  the plaintiff to relief on any theory, then a dismissal for failure to state a\r\n  claim is improper.Â  Id.Â  \r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina has recognized the doctrine of at-will employment since 1936.Â  See Shealy v. Fowler, 182 S.C. 81, 87, 188 S.E. 499, 502 (1936).Â  Generally,\r\n  under this doctrine an employer may discharge an employee for good reason, no\r\n  reason, or bad reason without incurring liability.Â  Ludwick v. This Minute\r\n    of Carolina, Inc., 287 S.C. 219, 221, 337 S.E.2d 213, 214 (1985) (citing\r\n  H.G. Wood, Master and Servant (1877)).Â  However, an employer may\r\n  nonetheless become liable in tort to the discharged employee under the public\r\n  policy exception, which protects the employee when &quot;the retaliatory\r\n  discharge of an at-will employee constitutes violation of a clear mandate of\r\n  public policy.&quot;Â  287 S.C. 225, 337 S.E.2d at 216.Â  \r\nOur\r\n  supreme court has held the criminal law clearly expresses public policy, and\r\n  consequently, discharges violating the criminal law or based upon the\r\n  employee's refusal to violate the criminal law fall within the public policy\r\n  exception.Â  Garner v. Morrison Knudsen Corp., 318 S.C. 223, 226, 456\r\n  S.E.2d 907, 909 (1995).Â  The Garner court expressly declined to hold\r\n  that the criminal law was the sole expression of public policy, leaving the\r\n  boundaries of the public policy exception somewhat flexible.Â  Id.Â  However,\r\n  South Carolina courts have declined to enforce the Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct as the public policy of the state.Â  Weatherford v. Price, 340\r\n  S.C. 572, 580-81, 532 S.E.2d 310, 314-15 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\nNovak\r\n  successfully alleged facts supporting retaliatory termination but failed to\r\n  identify a clearly stated public policy.Â  A party claiming wrongful termination\r\n  in violation of public policy must assert 1) she was discharged from at-will\r\n  employment, 2) the discharge was retaliatory, and 3) the discharge violated a\r\n  &quot;clear mandate of public policy.&quot;Â  Ludwick, 287 S.C. at 225,\r\n  337 S.E.2d at 216.Â  Novak's allegations support only two of these elements.Â  In\r\n  her complaint, Novak presented facts establishing the respondents terminated\r\n  her at-will employment.Â  She also alleged facts supporting her argument the\r\n  discharge was in retaliation for her performance.Â  However, her reliance on the\r\n  rule &quot;that attorneys take direct responsibility for matters of\r\n  professional responsibility and ethics in regard to the handling of legal\r\n  matters for clients&quot; as public policy is misplaced.Â  This requirement\r\n  exists in the South Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct, which appear in\r\n  Rule 407, SCACR, but have not been codified by the Legislature.Â  Because the\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct are not enforceable as public policy, Novak\r\n  failed to allege facts sufficient to meet the third element of wrongful\r\n  termination in violation of public policy. Â See Weatherford, 340\r\n  S.C. at 580-81, 532 S.E.2d at 314-15.Â  Consequently, the circuit court did not\r\n  err in dismissing her complaint under Rule 12(b)(6).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  restricting its analysis of the public policy element to whether Novak's\r\n  termination violated criminal law or whether the respondents asked Novak to\r\n  violate the criminal law, the circuit court relied on Lawson v. S.C. Dep't\r\n    of Corr., 340 S.C. 346, 350, 532 S.E.2d 259, 260-61 (2000).Â  We find no\r\n  indication our supreme court intended its opinion in Lawson to overrule\r\n  or limit its opinion in Garner.Â  Accordingly, we modify the circuit\r\n  court's decision to omit the statement that Lawson limited the public\r\n  policy exception to terminations involving violations of the criminal law.Â \r\n  Even without this limitation, in light of Weatherford, we find the\r\n  circuit court properly dismissed Novak's complaint because it failed to\r\n  enunciate any clear mandate of public policy violated by her termination.Â \r\n  Therefore, the decision of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  AS MODIFIED.Â  \r\nGEATHERS,\r\n  J., concurs.\r\nPIEPER,\r\n  J., concurring in result only:Â  I concur in result because I would find\r\n  Novak failed to preserve any of her issues for appellate review.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Neither Novak nor her counsel appeared at the hearing\r\n  on the respondents' motion to dismiss.Â  Although the circuit court's final\r\n  order recognized this failure to appear, the dismissal was based solely upon\r\n  Novak's failure to state a claim.Â  \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-226","title":"Williams v.

Bacot, Jr., of Surfside Beach, for Appellant.\r\n        John B. McCutcheon, Jr., of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  Larry Williams (Williams)\r\n  contends the trial court erred in denying his request for rescission of his\r\n  contract with the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) by\r\n  refusing to set aside the conveyance of his property (the Property) to SCDOT.Â \r\n  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nWilliams owned three tracts of real property: Tract\r\n  6A, Tract 6PCR, and Tract 7 adjacent to and at the corner of Road S-600 and\r\n  Pine Island Road in Horry County.Â  Only Tract 7 is in dispute in this case.Â  Williams\r\n  acquired Tract 7 between 1980 and 1982.Â  After acquiring Tract 7, Williams\r\n  constructed a nine-unit commercial building for business rental use.\r\nDuring the summer of 2000, SCDOT contacted Williams\r\n  about acquiring 2,662 square feet along the front of the Property for a\r\n  right-of-way expansion of the Robert M. Grissom Parkway.Â  Sometime between the\r\n  summer and September 2000, settlement negotiations reached a stalemate between\r\n  Williams and an eastern region right-of-way consultant.Â  On September 13, 2000,\r\n  Deborah Rice (Rice), the eastern region right-of-way administrator for SCDOT\r\n  and Rabih Hamzy (Hamzy), the assistant program manager with SCDOT, met with\r\n  Williams to facilitate a settlement agreement.\r\nAccording to Rice's testimony, Williams was concerned\r\n  about the functionality of his commercial units' parking spaces after the\r\n  proposed construction of the right-of-way.Â  Rice also testified Williams\r\n  believed the property was worth more than the $162,620 SCDOT offered, and as a\r\n  result, Williams made a counteroffer of $500,000.Â  Rice acknowledged the\r\n  parking situation needed further review and asked Hamzy to come up with\r\n  &quot;something&quot; that &quot;perhaps could be done [about] the\r\n  parking.&quot;\r\nHamzy enlisted Wilbur Smith Associates to produce\r\n  planning sheets to show the possibility of parking on Tract 7.Â  Hamzy\r\n  subsequently mailed Williams the plan sheets along with a transmittal letter\r\n  dated September 20, 2000.Â  Hamzy's letter stated, &quot;Dear Mr. Williams:\r\n  Enclosed are the plans [sic] sheets you requested.Â  If you have any other\r\n  questions, please call me at (803) 737-1616.Â  Sincerely, Rob Hamzy Program\r\n  Manager.&quot;\r\nOn September 28, 2000, Williams entered\r\n  into a contract with SCDOT for the conveyance of the Property for $385,000.Â  The\r\n  title was recorded on October 16, 2000, and provided, &quot;The above\r\n  consideration is for 0.197 of an acre of land, damages, and improvements\r\n  thereon, if any, including rights of access as maybe [sic] needed for\r\n  controlled access facilities.&quot;Â  Williams testified he agreed to demolish\r\n  one of his buildings.Â  \r\nAfter demolishing one of his buildings in\r\n  2001, Williams was told that his parking scheme was not feasible and that he\r\n  lacked sufficient space for cars to drive behind the building.Â  Also, Williams\r\n  was informed that the parking spaces did not meet the minimum length\r\n  requirement pursuant to Horry County's Code.Â  Williams testified he relied on\r\n  the plan sheets that Hamzy provided and asserted his agreement with SCDOT was\r\n  contingent on Hamzy's plan sheets.Â  Williams stated, &quot;[Hamzy] got involved\r\n  in it and he assured me, 'Mr. Williams, I can show you that you're going to\r\n  have parking.Â  You're going to have parking.'&quot;Â  Williams claims the deed's\r\n  special provision language concerning damages was in reference only to damages\r\n  relating to the right-of-way expansion and not to the issue of parking.Â  However,\r\n  Williams testified Rice might have informed him the deed's special provision\r\n  language included parking and all other damages related to the conveyance.Â  \r\nConversely, Hamzy contends the plan sheets\r\n  were provided for &quot;information only&quot; but later admitted there was no\r\n  documentation indicating the plan sheets were only for informational purposes.Â \r\n  Rice testified Williams did not notify her that the sale of the Property was\r\n  contingent upon Hamzy's parking scheme and the consideration for the deed\r\n  including all damages, parking, and access.Â  Specifically Rice stated, \r\n\r\n  I was very explicit in letting [Williams] know you and\r\n    I are the ones who are -- we are negotiating this, sir.Â  Whatever you get from\r\n    whomever, this is what we're signing for.Â  I want that understood, that this is\r\n    all damages.Â  Access, parking, this will be it.Â  This is the legal document\r\n    you're signing for your piece of property and what happens on here, this all\r\n    damages.Â  \r\n\r\nRice also asserted Williams received\r\n  additional compensation because she knew he was going to have problems with\r\n  parking or continuing his businesses.Â  \r\nWilliams filed an action in Horry County\r\n  seeking a declaratory judgment and rescission of the contract on the grounds of\r\n  mutual mistake and/or unilateral mistake.Â  On the issue of mutual mistake, the\r\n  trial court found SCDOT made no misrepresentation regarding parking.Â  On the\r\n  issue of unilateral mistake, the trial court found the deed's language included\r\n  all issues related to damages, which specifically included parking.Â  As a\r\n  result, the trial court denied Williams' request to rescind the contract with\r\n  SCDOT.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW \r\nAn action to set\r\n  aside a deed is a matter in equity.Â  Bullard v. Crawley, 294 S.C. 276,\r\n  278, 363 S.E.2d 897, 898&nbsp;(1987).Â  On appeal from an equitable action, an\r\n  appellate court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the\r\n  evidence.Â  Buffington v. T.O.E. Enter.,&nbsp;383 S.C. 388, 391, 680\r\n  S.E.2d 289, 290&nbsp;(2009).Â  The appellant is not relieved of his burden of convincing\r\n  the appellate court the trial judge committed error in his findings.Â  Pinckney\r\n    v. Warren,&nbsp;344 S.C. 382, 387-88, 544 S.E.2d 620, 623&nbsp;(2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA. Unilateral and Mutual\r\n  Mistake\r\nWilliams argues the trial court erred in\r\n  refusing to rescind the conveyance of the property on the basis of unilateral\r\n  and mutual mistake.Â  We believe this issue has been abandoned on appeal.\r\nAn issue is deemed\r\n  abandoned and will not be considered on appeal if the argument is raised in a\r\n  brief but not supported by authority.Â  Bryson v. Bryson, 378 S.C. 502,\r\n  510, 662 S.E.2d 611, 615&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2008).Â  Williams' statement of the\r\n  issues on appeal states, &quot;Did the lower court err in denying appellant's\r\n  request for recession of the contract between the parties?&quot; However,\r\n  Williams fails to produce any argument or authority in support of his\r\n  contention that the trial court erred in refusing to find unilateral or mutual\r\n  mistake regarding the conveyance of the property to SCDOT.Â  Williams' citation\r\n  of authority only relates to the issue of equitable estoppel.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  conclude this issue has been abandoned on appeal.Â  \r\nB. Equitable Estoppel\r\nWilliams argues the\r\n  trial court erred in refusing to rescind the conveyance on the basis of\r\n  equitable estoppel.Â  Specifically, Williams asserts the elements of equitable\r\n  estoppel are met in this case because (1) he did not have any knowledge about\r\n  how many parking spaces would be available since he is not an engineer; (2) he\r\n  justifiably relied on Hamzy's representation of available parking as an agent\r\n  of SCDOT; and (3) he has suffered a prejudicial change in position because he\r\n  demolished one of his units and has less building space and reduced his potential\r\n  for rental income.Â  We believe this issue is not preserved for review.\r\nIssues cannot be\r\n  raised for the first time on appeal, but must be raised to and ruled upon by\r\n  the trial court to preserve it for appellate review.Â  Richland County v.\r\n    Carolina Chloride, Inc.,&nbsp;382 S.C. 634, 655, 677 S.E.2d 892,\r\n  903&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009).Â  The imposition\r\n  of the preservation requirement upon an appellant is designed to enable the\r\n  lower court to rule properly after consideration of all relevant facts, law,\r\n  and arguments.Â  Nicholson v. Nicholson, 378 S.C. 523, 537, 663 S.E.2d\r\n  74, 82&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2008).\r\nAfter a careful\r\n  review of the record, we believe Williams' equitable estoppel argument was\r\n  neither raised to nor ruled upon by the trial court.Â  The transcript of the\r\n  hearing supports our conclusion.Â  The trial court's order provides a complete\r\n  designation of the specific issues presented for review.Â  The trial court's\r\n  order stated, &quot;[Plaintiff] seeks declaratory judgment and also seeks to\r\n  set aside the conveyance of real property for alleged rescission due to mutual\r\n  mistake and/or rescission due to unilateral mistake.&quot;Â  The trial court\r\n  further concluded, &quot;There are no additional bases for recovery stated by\r\n  the Plaintiff under this cause of action beyond which are included in the other\r\n  causes of action, addressed above.&quot;Â  Finally, the trial court stated that\r\n  &quot;judgment be entered in favor of the Defendant with respect to the Plaintiff's\r\n  causes of action for recession due to mutual mistake, rescission due to\r\n  unilateral mistake, and declaratory judgment.&quot;Â  Accordingly, we find the\r\n  issue of equitable estoppel is not preserved for our review.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  trial court's decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS, GEATHERS,\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-227","title":"SCDSS v.

(Mother) appeals from the family court's order terminating her parental\r\n  rights (TPR) to her minor children, R.A.M., J.M.M., C.D.M., and J.I.M. (collectively\r\n  the Children).Â  Mother argues the family court erred in finding DSS established,\r\n  by clear and convincing evidence, that:Â  (1)\r\n  Mother failed to remedy the conditions causing removal; (2) the home could not be\r\n  made safe within twelve months because of the severity and repetition of abuse;\r\n  (3) R.A.M., J.M.M., and\r\n  C.D.M. had been in foster care for\r\n  fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months; and (4) TPR was in the Children's\r\n  best interests.\r\n1. We affirm the family\r\n  court's finding DSS established by clear and convincing evidence Mother failed to remedy the conditions leading to the\r\n  Children's removal.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570 (2008) (stating the\r\n  family court may order TPR upon finding a statutory ground is established and\r\n  also finding TPR is in the best interest of the children); Â§ 63-7-2570(2)\r\n  (2008) (explaining a statutory ground for TPR is established when &quot;[t]he\r\n  child has been removed from the parent . . . , has been out of the home for a\r\n  period of six months following the adoption of a placement plan . . . and the\r\n  parent has not remedied the conditions which caused the removal&quot;).Â  \r\n2. We affirm the family\r\n  court's finding DSS established by clear and convincing evidence the home could not be made safe within twelve months\r\n  because of the severity and repetition of abuse.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  63-7-2570 (2008) (stating the family court may order TPR upon finding a\r\n  statutory ground is established and also finding TPR is in the best interest of\r\n  the children); Â§ 63-7-2570(1) (2008) (explaining a statutory ground for TPR is\r\n  established when &quot;[t]he child or another child in the home has been harmed\r\n  as defined in section 63&#8209;7&#8209;20, and because of the severity or\r\n  repetition of the abuse or neglect, it is not reasonably likely that the home\r\n  can be made safe within twelve months.Â  In determining the likelihood that the\r\n  home can be made safe, the parent's previous abuse or neglect of the child or\r\n  another child in the home may be considered.&quot;). \r\n3.

Campbell argues the\r\n  circuit court erred in admitting the testimony of his abuse of a different\r\n  child. Â We agree the circuit court erred in finding the testimony admissible\r\n  under Rule 404(b), SCRE, to show motive\r\n  and intent.Â  See State v.\r\n    Nelson, 331 S.C. 1, 11, 501 S.E.2d\r\n  716, 721 (1998) (holding a person commits a sexual offense for the obvious\r\n  motive of sexual gratification, and where this fact is apparent from the\r\n  charges, evidence of motive and intent are not a material issue).Â  However, we\r\n  affirm on the ground the testimony was admissible under Rule 404(b), SCRE, to\r\n  show common scheme or plan.Â  Rule 220(c), SCACR, provides the appellate court may rely on any other reason\r\n  appearing in the record to affirm the lower court's ruling, order, decision or\r\n  judgment.Â  &quot;It is within the appellate court's discretion whether to\r\n  address any additional sustaining grounds.&quot;Â  I'On v. Town of Mount\r\n    Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000). Â Rule 404(b), SCRE, permits the admission of evidence of a\r\n  common scheme or plan, and such evidence is relevant because proof of one is\r\n  strong proof of the other.Â  State v. Wallace, 384 S.C. 428, 433, 683\r\n  S.E.2d 275, 277 (2009). Â &quot;When determining whether evidence is admissible\r\n  as common scheme or plan, the trial court must analyze the similarities and\r\n  dissimilarities between the crime charged and the bad act evidence to determine\r\n  whether there is a close degree of similarity.&quot; Â Id. at 433, 683\r\n  S.E.2d at 277-78.Â  &quot;When the similarities outweigh the dissimilarities,\r\n  the bad act evidence is admissible under Rule 404(b).&quot;[1]Â  Id.\r\n2.Â  Campbell argues the circuit\r\n  court erred and abused its discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial after the\r\n  victim's testimony about a news story exceeded the scope agreed upon by the\r\n  parties.Â  Campbell objected when he felt the testimony inferred he had been\r\n  similarly and recently charged with sexual abuse.Â  However, the objection was\r\n  never ruled upon, and therefore, the issue is not preserved.Â  See State\r\n    v.

Murray filed a complaint with\r\n  the circuit court against the State of South Carolina and the South Carolina\r\n  Department of Corrections, alleging he was unlawfully arrested by a parole\r\n  officer for a parole violation.Â  The circuit court granted summary judgment on behalf of the State and the Department\r\n  of Corrections. Â Murray appeals, arguing the circuit court erred in finding: (1)\r\n  he pled guilty to possession of crack cocaine in 1994 and the arrest warrant\r\n  relied on this alleged offense for probable cause; and (2) his parole arrest\r\n  warrant was valid without the signature of an impartial judicial officer.Â  We affirm[1] pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities.Â  \r\n1. As to whether the circuit court\r\n  erred in finding Murray pled guilty to possession of crack cocaine and such\r\n  alleged offense supplied the arrest warrant with probable cause:Â  Doe\r\n    v.

(Father) to his minor child, J.W.Â Â Â Â Â \r\n  Mother and Father both appealed separately, though Father's appeal was filed\r\n  pursuant to Ex Parte Cauthen, 291 S.C. 465, 354 S.E.2d 381 (1987).Â  \r\nI.Â \r\n  Mother's Appeal \r\nMother\r\n  argues the family court erred in terminating her parental rights pursuant to\r\n  section 63-7-2570(1) of the South Carolina Code (2008).Â  Additionally, Mother contends\r\n  the family court erred in terminating her parental rights when the Children's\r\n  guardian ad litem (the GAL) failed to comply with statutory requirements.Â  We affirm\r\n  pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities: \r\n1.Â  As to whether the family court erred in\r\n  terminating Mother's parental rights:Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570\r\n  (2008) (stating the family court may order TPR upon finding a statutory ground\r\n  is established and also finding TPR is in the best interest of the children); Â§\r\n  63-7-2570(1) (2008) (explaining a statutory ground for TPR is established when &quot;[t]he\r\n  child or another child in the home has been harmed as defined in [s]ection 63&#8209;7&#8209;20,\r\n  and because of the severity or repetition of the abuse or neglect, it is not\r\n  reasonably likely that the home can be made safe within twelve months.Â  In\r\n  determining the likelihood that the home can be made safe, the parent's\r\n  previous abuse or neglect of the child or another child in the home may be\r\n  considered.&quot;). \r\n2.Â \r\n  As to Mother's argument the GAL's failure to comply with statutory requirements\r\n  denied her certain safeguards and due process of law: Staubes v.

Hancock, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        John M.S. Hoefer and Tracey C. Green, of Columbia, for Respondents. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â In this\r\n  appeal of an order granting summary judgment to Respondents, the South Carolina\r\n  Department of Revenue (Department) challenges the Administrative Law Court's\r\n  (ALC's) determination that Respondents were not telephone companies and thus\r\n  did not owe any license fees pursuant to section 12-20-100 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (2000).Â  The Department also contends that the ALC failed to give\r\n  proper consideration to other issues raised by the parties in their summary\r\n  judgment motions.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nRespondents are Alltel\r\n  Communications, Inc., Alltel Mobile Communications of the Carolinas, Inc., New\r\n  York Newco Subsidiary, Inc., Telespectrum, Inc., 360 Communications Co. of SC\r\n  No. 1, and 360 Communications Co. of SC No. 2.[1]Â \r\n  During the tax years ending December 31, 1999 through December 31, 2003 (Tax\r\n  Years), Respondents were either directly engaged, or owned interests in\r\n  partnerships that were engaged, in the business of providing wireless voice and\r\n  data communications service via radio within South Carolina.Â  \r\nIn 2004, the Department\r\n  initiated an audit of Respondents.Â  At the conclusion of the audit, the\r\n  Department notified Respondents that it had determined that a deficiency\r\n  existed in the license fees paid by Respondents for the Tax Years.Â  The\r\n  Department proposed to assess Respondents $4,709,671 in additional license\r\n  fees, interest, and penalties.Â  \r\nThe basis for the proposed\r\n  assessment was the Department's determination that Respondents had erroneously\r\n  used section 12-20-50 of the South Carolina Code (2000) to calculate their\r\n  license fees.Â  The Department concluded that each Respondent was a\r\n  &quot;telephone company&quot; and thus was required to pay license fees in\r\n  accordance with section 12-20-100, rather than section 12-20-50.Â  \r\nRespondents each timely filed\r\n  with the Department a protest of the proposed assessment.Â  The Department issued\r\n  a final agency determination denying the protests on May 30, 2007.Â  Thereafter,\r\n  each Respondent timely filed a request for a contested case hearing with the\r\n  ALC.Â  \r\nThe ALC consolidated the six\r\n  cases.Â  After filing joint stipulations of facts, the parties filed\r\n  cross-motions for summary judgment.Â  In their summary judgment motion,\r\n  Respondents contended that section 12-20-100 did not apply to them because they\r\n  were not telephone companies. Â Alternatively, Respondents argued that, if they\r\n  were telephone companies, the Department did not properly calculate the license\r\n  fee owed by Respondents under section 12-20-100.Â  Specifically, Respondents\r\n  claimed that the Department erred by determining that they derived gross\r\n  receipts from &quot;services rendered from regulated business&quot; as\r\n  contemplated by section 12-20-100(A)(2)(a).Â  Additionally, Respondents\r\n  contended that section 12-20-100 did not apply to partnerships and that the\r\n  Department therefore erred by including in its assessment the assets and gross\r\n  receipts attributable to Respondents' partnership interests.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  Respondents claimed that the Department should not have imposed a\r\n  &quot;substantial understatement&quot; penalty under section 12-54-155 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (2000) because Respondents' position with respect to their\r\n  liability under section 12-20-100 was supported by substantial authority.Â \r\n  Lastly, Respondents argued that the Department made certain calculation errors\r\n  with respect to the amounts owed by Alltel Mobile Communications of the\r\n  Carolinas, Inc. and New York Newco Subsidiary, Inc.Â  \r\nOn April 22, 2008, the ALC\r\n  granted Respondents' motion for summary judgment and denied the Department's\r\n  motion.Â  The ALC determined that Respondents were not telephone companies for\r\n  the purposes of section 12-20-100 and thus were not required to pay license\r\n  fees under that statute.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Did the\r\n  ALC err by granting summary judgment to Respondents?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the ALC fail to give proper\r\n  consideration to other issues raised by the parties in their summary judgment\r\n  motions?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing\r\n  the grant of summary judgment, an appellate court applies the same standard that\r\n  governed the trial court.Â  Wogan v. Kunze, 379 S.C. 581, 585, 666 S.E.2d\r\n  901, 903 (2008).Â  As in civil matters, summary judgment is appropriate in an\r\n  administrative matter when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the\r\n  moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  See Rule\r\n  56(c), SCRCP (setting forth the standard for granting summary judgment in civil\r\n  matters); South Carolina Administrative Practice and Procedure 175\r\n  (Randolph R. Lowell ed., 2d ed. 2008) (stating that the standard for granting\r\n  summary judgment in an administrative matter is the same as in a civil matter). \r\nBecause summary\r\n  judgment is a drastic remedy, it should be cautiously invoked to ensure that a\r\n  litigant is not improperly deprived of a trial on disputed factual issues. Â Mulherin-Howell\r\n    v. Cobb, 362 S.C. 588, 597, 608 S.E.2d 587, 592 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Where further inquiry into the facts of\r\n  the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law, summary judgment\r\n  is not appropriate.Â  Brockbank v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 378,\r\n  534 S.E.2d 688, 692 (2000).Â  Moreover, &quot;[s]ummary judgment should not be\r\n  granted even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts if there is\r\n  dispute as to the conclusion to be drawn from those facts.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Section 12-20-100\r\nThe Department\r\n  argues that the ALC erred by granting summary judgment to Respondents on the\r\n  ground that Respondents did not constitute telephone companies for the purposes\r\n  of section 12-20-100.Â  Because we conclude that further inquiry into the facts\r\n  is necessary to resolve this issue, we agree.\r\nSection\r\n  12-20-100(A) provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  In the\r\n    place of the license fee imposed by Section 12-20-50, every express company,\r\n    street railway company, navigation company, waterworks company, power company,\r\n    electric cooperative, light company, gas company, telegraph company, and telephone\r\n      company shall file an annual report with the department and pay a license\r\n    fee as follows: \r\n  \r\n    (1) one\r\n      dollar for each thousand dollars, or fraction of a thousand dollars, of fair\r\n      market value of property owned and used within this State in the conduct of\r\n      business as determined by the department for property tax purposes for the\r\n      preceding taxable year; and \r\n    (2)(a) three dollars for each thousand dollars, or fraction of a thousand dollars,\r\n      of gross receipts derived from services rendered from regulated business within\r\n      this State during the preceding taxable year, except that with regard to\r\n      electric cooperatives, only distribution electric cooperatives are subject to\r\n      the gross receipts portion of the license fee under this subitem (2)(a). \r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-20-100(A)\r\n  (2000) (emphasis added).[2] Â \r\nThe term &quot;telephone\r\n  company&quot; is not defined in section 12-20-100 or in the definitional\r\n  section of chapter 20 of title 12.[3]Â \r\n  &quot;Where a word is not defined in a statute, our appellate courts have\r\n  looked to the usual dictionary meaning to supply its meaning.&quot;Â  Berkeley\r\n    County Sch. Dist. v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 383 S.C. 334, 345, 679 S.E.2d 913,\r\n  919 (2009) (quoting Lee v. Thermal Eng'g Corp., 352 S.C. 81, 91-92, 572\r\n  S.E.2d 298, 303 (Ct. App. 2002)).Â  In addition to utilizing dictionaries, our courts\r\n  have reviewed other state statutes, as well as state appellate decisions, to\r\n  ascertain the meaning of an undefined statutory term.Â  See Sonoco\r\n    Products Co. v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 378 S.C. 385, 662 S.E.2d 599 (2008)\r\n  (where the term &quot;contiguous&quot; was not defined in the applicable statute,\r\n  the court reviewed dictionaries, state statutes, and state appellate decisions that\r\n  dealt with the concept of contiguity in order to glean the appropriate\r\n  definition).Â  \r\nHere, the ALC concluded that\r\n  &quot;based on the plain language of the statute,&quot; none of the Respondents\r\n  constituted a telephone company for the purposes of section 12-20-100 because\r\n  &quot;the services they provide relate to the provision of wireless\r\n  communications via radio, not communications via telephone.&quot;Â  The ALC's\r\n  decision does not cite a dictionary definition of either &quot;telephone&quot;\r\n  or &quot;telephone company,&quot; nor does it cite a South Carolina appellate court\r\n  decision construing those terms.Â  Rather, it appears that, in reaching its\r\n  result, the ALC relied primarily upon the parties' stipulation that\r\n  &quot;[t]elephones and telephone companies transmit intelligence over a vast\r\n    network of wires located in public rights of way and in easements over\r\n  private property.&quot; Â (emphasis added).[4]\r\nAt first blush, the parties'\r\n  stipulation seems to provide significant support for the ALC's conclusion.Â \r\n  However, upon further reflection, we conclude that the stipulation is not dispositive\r\n  of this case.Â  The question\r\n  of what the legislature intended for the term &quot;telephone company&quot; to\r\n  mean for the purposes of section 12-20-100 is a question of law.Â  See Charleston\r\n    County Parks &amp; Recreation Comm'n v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, 67, 459 S.E.2d\r\n  841, 843 (1995) (&quot;The determination of legislative intent is a matter of\r\n  law.&quot;); Bryant v. State, 384 S.C. 525, 529, 683 S.E.2d 280, 282\r\n  (2009) (&quot;As this case involves statutory interpretation, we are presented\r\n  with a question of law.&quot;); Catawba Indian Tribe of S.C. v. State,\r\n  372 S.C. 519, 524, 642 S.E.2d 751, 753 (2007) (&quot;The issue of\r\n  interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the court.&quot;).Â  Importantly, courts are generally not bound by\r\n  stipulations regarding questions of law.Â  See Greenville\r\n    County Fair Ass'n v. Christenberry, 198 S.C. 338, 345, 17 S.E.2d 857, 859\r\n  (1941) (holding that a &quot;stipulation as to the law&quot; is generally not\r\n  binding upon the courts); McDuffie v. McDuffie, 308 S.C. 401, 409-10,\r\n  418 S.E.2d 331, 336 (Ct. App. 1992) (holding that stipulations involving\r\n  questions of law are not binding on the court); 83 C.J.S. Stipulations Â§\r\n  30 (2000) (stating that courts are not bound by stipulations regarding\r\n  questions of law, such as the intent of a lawmaking body or the construction of\r\n  a statute).Â  \r\nMoreover, we note\r\n  that stipulations must be &quot;construed like a contract, to effect the intent\r\n  of the parties.&quot;Â  Webster v. Holly Hill Lumber Co., 268 S.C. 416,\r\n  421, 234 S.E.2d 232, 234 (1977). Â Here, we do not believe that it was the\r\n  Department's intent to, in essence, forfeit its entire case by stipulation.Â  Regardless,\r\n  we conclude that the parties were not competent to stipulate as to the intent\r\n  of the legislature regarding its use of the term &quot;telephone company&quot;\r\n  in Section 12-20-100.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nBecause we find\r\n  that the parties' stipulation as to the meaning of the term &quot;telephone\r\n  company&quot; was not dispositive of this case, we must look to the remaining\r\n  portions of the record to determine whether Respondents fell within the terms\r\n  of section 12-20-100.Â  Based upon our careful review of the record, we conclude\r\n  that additional development of the facts is necessary to clarify the\r\n  application of section 12-20-100 as to Respondents. Â See Brockbank,\r\n  341 S.C. at 378, 534 S.E.2d at 692 (holding that summary judgment is not\r\n  appropriate when additional development of the facts is desirable to clarify\r\n  the application of the law). Â For instance, further inquiry into the nature of\r\n  the services provided by Respondents is essential.Â  Although the parties have made\r\n  some stipulations regarding Respondents' services, we do not believe that those\r\n  stipulations are sufficient to determine whether Respondents constitute\r\n  telephone companies for the purposes of section 12-20-100.Â Â  \r\nWe find support\r\n  for our conclusion in Shea v. State Dep't of Mental Retardation.[5]Â  In that case, we held that the trial\r\n  court erred by granting summary judgment on the issue of whether the Department\r\n  of Mental Retardation's Midlands Center constituted a &quot;hospital or other\r\n  facility&quot; within the meaning of section 44-7-50 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (1976).Â  We concluded that further inquiry into the facts was warranted, specifically\r\n  noting that the record was &quot;not clear&quot; as to the nature of the\r\n  Midlands Center.Â  Shea, 279 S.C. at 611, 310 S.E.2d at 823.Â  In reaching\r\n  our decision, we stated:\r\n\r\n  The question of the construction of this statute as applied to a\r\n    mental retardation facility is an important question of novel impression. Â If\r\n    the statute's application is not absolutely clear as a matter of law, this\r\n    question should not be decided without fully developing the facts by means of\r\n    trial.\r\n\r\nId. at 611, 310 S.E.2d at 822.Â  \r\nHere, the construction of section 12-20-100 as\r\n  applied to wireless communications service providers is an important question\r\n  of novel impression.Â  No appellate court in this State has construed the term\r\n  &quot;telephone company&quot; for the purposes of section 12-20-100.Â  Moreover,\r\n  the application of section 12-20-100 is not &quot;absolutely clear.&quot;Â  As\r\n  noted above, the term &quot;telephone company&quot; is not defined in section\r\n  12-20-100 or in the applicable\r\n  definitional section.Â  Additionally,\r\n  an examination of other South Carolina statutes and regulations reveals that while\r\n  wireless communications service providers are treated differently from landline\r\n  telephone companies for regulatory purposes,[6] their services are treated the same with respect to the sales and use tax.[7] Â Furthermore, courts from other jurisdictions\r\n  that have addressed issues similar to the one presented here have not reached\r\n  consistent results.Â  Compare Bell Atl. Mobile of Mass. Corp., Ltd. v.\r\n    Comm'r of Revenue, 884 N.E.2d 978 (Mass. 2008) (holding that a cell phone\r\n  service provider was not a &quot;telephone company&quot; for the purposes of a\r\n  statute providing for the central valuation of the &quot;machinery, poles,\r\n  wires and underground conduits, wires and pipes of all telephone and telegraph\r\n  companies&quot;), and In re Appeal of Topeka SMSA Ltd. P'ship, 917 P.2d 827 (Kan. 1996) (holding that companies providing two-way\r\n  cellular radio telecommunications service did not transmit &quot;telephonic\r\n  messages&quot; and thus could not be taxed as public utilities), with City\r\n    of Jefferson City v. Cingular Wireless, LLC, 531 F.3d 595 (8th Cir. 2008) (holding\r\n  that local tax ordinance imposing a tax on businesses supplying telephones and\r\n  telephonic service applied to a cell phone service provider), cert. denied,\r\n  129 S. Ct. 739 (2008), Airtouch\r\n    Commc'ns, Inc. v. Dep't of Revenue, 76 P.3d 342 (Wyo. 2003) (finding\r\n  that cellular service providers were telephone companies for the purposes of a property\r\n  assessment statute), Southwestern\r\n    Bell Mobile Sys., Inc. v. Arkansas Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 40 S.W.3d 838 (Ark. Ct. App. 2001) (finding that commercial mobile radio service\r\n  providers fell within terms of a property assessment statute that applied to &quot;telephone\r\n  . . . or other similar companies&quot;), City of Sunset Hills v.\r\n    Southwestern Bell Mobile Sys., Inc.,\r\n  14 S.W.3d 54 (Mo. Ct. App. 1999) (concluding that wireless communications\r\n  service provider was a telephone company and that City therefore had statutory authority\r\n  to impose a business license fee on it), and Cent. Ky. Cellular Tel.\r\n    Co. v. Commonwealth, 897 S.W.2d 601 (Ky. Ct. App. 1995) (holding that cellular\r\n  phone companies constituted telephone companies for the purposes of a property\r\n  tax statute).\r\nBecause we find\r\n  that further development of the facts is necessary to ascertain whether\r\n  Respondents constitute telephone companies for the purposes of section\r\n  12-20-100, we hold that the ALC erred by granting summary judgment on that\r\n  issue.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the ALC's grant of summary judgment and remand\r\n  for further proceedings as to the applicability of section 12-20-100 to\r\n  Respondents.Â  \r\nII. ALC's Failure to Properly Rule\r\n  on Certain Issues\r\nThe Department also contends\r\n  that the ALC failed to give proper consideration to other issues raised by the\r\n  parties in their summary judgment motions.Â  Specifically, the Department refers\r\n  to the following portion of the ALC's decision:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    Alltel Entities further contend that DOR improperly calculated &quot;gross\r\n    receipts from regulated business&quot; in its computation of the Â§ 12-20-100 license\r\n    fee due to the absence of a regulated business; that it improperly included the\r\n    assets and gross receipts from partnerships in the computation of the Â§\r\n    12-20-100 license fee because the corporate license fee applies only to\r\n    corporations; and, that it improperly asserted a substantial understatement\r\n    penalty against the Alltel Entities under Â§ 12-54-155 (2000) because there is\r\n    substantial authority for the calculation of the license fee on the original\r\n    license fee returns.Â  Because the Court finds that Â§ 12-20-100 does not apply\r\n    to the Alltel Entities, it is unnecessary to reach these further assertions.Â \r\n    If the Court were to reach these issues, however, it would find for the Alltel\r\n    Entities on each of these issues for the reasons set forth above.\r\n\r\n(footnotes omitted).\r\n&quot;An administrative body\r\n  must make findings which are sufficiently detailed to enable this Court to\r\n  determine whether the findings are supported by the evidence and whether the\r\n  law has been applied properly to those findings.&quot;Â  Hamm v. S.C. Pub.\r\n    Serv. Comm'n, 309 S.C. 295, 300, 422 S.E.2d 118, 121 (1992).Â  An appellate\r\n  court &quot;will not accept an administrative agency's decision at face value\r\n  without requiring the agency to explain its reasoning.&quot;Â  Kiawah Prop.\r\n    Owners Group v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n of S.C., 338 S.C. 92, 96, 525 S.E.2d 863,\r\n  865 (1999).Â  When an administrative agency's order fails to set forth the basis\r\n  for its determination, the proper course of action is to remand the matter to\r\n  the administrative agency.Â  Id. at 97, 525 S.E.2d at 865.Â Â  \r\nHere, it is questionable\r\n  whether the ALC actually ruled on the issues mentioned in the above-referenced\r\n  portion of its decision.Â  The text of the decision states that &quot;[i]f the Court were to reach these issues, . . . it would find for the Alltel\r\n  Entities on each of these issues for the reasons set forth above.&quot; Â (emphases\r\n  added).Â  This statement indicates that it was not the ALC's intent to rule on\r\n  these issues.[8] Â Nonetheless, to the extent that the ALC did rule on any of these issues, we find\r\n  that the rulings were not sufficiently detailed to enable proper review.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we reverse the above-referenced portion of the ALC's decision and\r\n  remand the issues discussed therein to the ALC. Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, the ALC's order granting summary judgment to Respondents is \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nPIEPER and GEATHERS, JJ.,\r\n  and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The names of a few of the Respondents are not spelled\r\n  consistently throughout the record.Â  We defer to the spellings set forth in the\r\n  text of Respondents' brief and the text of the ALC's order, and we order that\r\n  the case caption be amended accordingly. \r\n[2] Companies that do not fall within section 12-20-100 may\r\n  nevertheless be required to pay an annual license fee in accordance with\r\n  section 12-20-50 of the South Carolina Code (2000 &amp; Supp. 2009).Â  That\r\n  section provides in part: &quot;Except as provided in Section 12-20-100, every\r\n  corporation required to file an annual report shall pay an annual license fee\r\n  of fifteen dollars plus one dollar for each thousand dollars, or fraction of a\r\n  thousand dollars, of capital stock and paid-in or capital surplus of the\r\n  corporation as shown by the records of the corporation on the first day of the\r\n  taxable year in which the report is filed.&quot; Â S.C.

Â§ 12-20-50(A)\r\n  (2000).\r\n[3] The definitions for chapter 20 of title 12 are set\r\n  forth in section 12-20-10 of the South Carolina Code (2000).\r\n[4] Although the ALC did not rely exclusively upon the\r\n  parties' stipulation, the stipulation was clearly a key factor in the court's decision.Â \r\n  For instance, in a footnote, the ALC stated that the stipulation &quot;would\r\n  seem to resolve the issue in favor of the Alltel Entities.&quot;Â  \r\n[5] 279 S.C. 604, 310 S.E.2d 819 (Ct. App. 1983), overruled on other grounds by McCall v. Batson, 285 S.C. 243, 329\r\n  S.E.2d 741 (1985).\r\n[6] SeeS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-11-10(f) (1976) (excluding telephone utilities from the\r\n  definition of &quot;radio common carrier&quot;).\r\n[7] See27\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 117-329.4 (Supp. 2009) (&quot;The following are examples\r\n  of communication services that are subject to the sales and use tax . . . : (a)\r\n  Telephone services, including telephone services provided via . . . a\r\n    wireless transmission system . . .&quot;) (emphasis added).Â  \r\n[8] Although the footnotes accompanying this portion of\r\n  the ALC's decision purport to contain &quot;alternative&quot; findings, the\r\n  explanation given for most of the findings is simply &quot;for the reasons set\r\n  forth above.&quot; Â This fact suggests that the findings were not based on independent\r\n  grounds, but rather on the ALC's conclusion that Respondents did not constitute\r\n  telephone companies for the purposes of section 12-20-100.Â  Â Â \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-233","title":"State v.

Driggers, pro se, of Lake City, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tJ. Jakob Kennedy, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Marion L. Driggers appeals the trial\r\n  court's order dismissing his motion to restore.Â  Driggers argues the trial\r\n  court erred in: (1) ordering a continuance of his hearing; (2) denying his\r\n  motion to restore; (3) &quot;not checking due process on summary judgment&quot;;\r\n  (4) failing to investigate who had a claim to personal property at issue in\r\n  this case; (5) failing to call witnesses to verify the validity of the\r\n  contracts at issue in this case; (6) &quot;not granting 27-27-10 for\r\n  Improvements&quot;; (7) failing to grant a continuance to allow his witnesses\r\n  to appear; (8) failing to question witnesses regarding cutting off power before\r\n  possession, unjust enrichment or quantum merit, the Hunt Club Contract, or the\r\n  signing of the stipulation of dismissal; (9) not granting a jury trial because\r\n  of the compelling evidence in the case; and (10) failing to allow Driggers to\r\n  subpoena evidence.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nAs to Driggers' argument that the trial court erred in ordering a\r\n  continuance of his hearing, the trial\r\n  court found Nexsen's attorney was involved in a jury trial in Florence County\r\n  and correctly continued the hearing because the jury trial had priority over\r\n  the hearing.Â  See Rule 601, SCACR (stating a circuit court common pleas\r\n  jury term has priority over a circuit court common pleas non-jury term); Plyler\r\n    v. Burns, 373 S.C. 637, 650, 647 S.E.2d 188, 195 (2007) (&quot;The grant or\r\n  denial of a continuance is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and\r\n  is reviewable on appeal only when an abuse of discretion appears from the record.&quot;).Â \r\n  Â Â \r\nAs to Driggers' contention that the trial court erred in denying\r\n  his motion to restore, the case was\r\n  previously dismissed with prejudice, which precludes any subsequent attempts by\r\n  Driggers to restore the case. See Rule 41(a), SCRCP (stating a case may\r\n  be voluntary dismissed by stipulation &quot;by filing a stipulation of\r\n  dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared in the action&quot;); Laughon\r\n    v. O'Braitis, 360 S.C. 520, 527, 602 S.E.2d 108, 111 (Ct. App. 2004) (&quot;A\r\n  dismissal with prejudice acts as an adjudication on the merits and therefore\r\n  precludes subsequent litigation just as if the action had been tried to a final\r\n  adjudication.&quot;); Motley v.

Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-1700(C) (2008) (&quot;If the [family] court\r\n  approves a plan that is not reunification with the parents, custody or\r\n  guardianship with a fit and willing relative, or termination of parental\r\n  rights, the [family] court must find compelling reasons for approval of the\r\n  plan and that the plan is in the child's best interests.&quot;).Â  Here,\r\n  compelling reasons supported the family court's approval of the permanent plan\r\n  to terminate reunification services for Grandmother and proceed with\r\n  termination of Mother and Father's parental rights (TPR).Â  Grandmother is not\r\n  able to care for Child at the current time.Â  Terminating reunification services\r\n  and proceeding with TPR is also in the Child's best interest.Â  No viable family\r\n  members are able to care for Child.Â  In comparison, Child is thriving in the\r\n  care of her current foster care family, and the foster care parents have\r\n  indicated a willingness to adopt Child.Â Â Â Â  \r\n2.&nbsp; Regarding\r\n  Grandmother's argument that Child's GAL did not perform her duties as mandated\r\n  by the statutory and common law, we find the family court acted within its\r\n  discretion in denying Grandmother's Rule 59, SCRCP, motion for rehearing.Â \r\n  Sufficient evidence in the record supports the family court's ruling on the\r\n  Rule 59 motion based on the best interests of Child.Â  Additionally, this issue\r\n  is not preserved for our review because Grandmother raised this issue for the\r\n  first time in her Rule 59 motion.Â  See Dixon v.

Garrison Hill, Circuit Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No.Â  2010-UP-241\r\nHeard March 2, 2010 â€“ Filed April 14, 2010\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tDebra J. Gammons, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tHeath Preston Taylor, of West Columbia, and Janis Richardson Hall,\r\n  of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The City of Greenville (City)\r\n  charged Michele Mote McCollum with driving under the influence (DUI).Â  After\r\n  the municipal court dismissed the charge, the circuit court affirmed the\r\n  dismissal.&nbsp; The City appeals, arguing the dismissal was improper because\r\n  the City complied with all discovery and statutory requirements.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMcCollum was charged with DUI, first offense, in January 2007. Â She\r\n  requested a jury trial and submitted a request for discovery to the City. Â The\r\n  City responded by furnishing McCollum certain information, but as to theÂ  video\r\n  of the Breath Alcohol Analysis Test, the City supplied a password that\r\n  allegedly allowed McCollum to view the video by going to a State Law\r\n  Enforcement Division (SLED) internet site. Â On July 30, 2007, when the parties\r\n  appeared before the municipal court for trial, McCollum informed the court of\r\n  her inability to properly access the video from SLED's website. Â The case was\r\n  continued, with the municipal court suggesting the City provide McCollum with\r\n  the video by another form of media.\r\nThe parties again appeared before the municipal court on October\r\n  23, 2007. Â At that time McCollum moved pursuant to section 56-5-2953 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (Supp. 2009) to dismiss the charge because she had not\r\n  received a copy of the video from the City. Â After entertaining extensive oral\r\n  argument, the municipal court granted the motion to dismiss, stating the\r\n  statute required the City either to produce the video or provide an affidavit\r\n  indicating that there were &quot;exigent circumstances related to failure or\r\n  inability of the City to provide&quot; the video.\r\nThe City appealed the municipal court's dismissal to the circuit\r\n  court. The City's &quot;grounds for appeal,&quot; as discussed in its Notice of\r\n  Intent to Appeal, concluded the municipal court erred in holding that section\r\n  56-5-2953 was violated. Â The City also noted it did not violate Rule 5, SCRCrimP,\r\n  because the &quot;video is not within the possession, custody, nor control of\r\n  the City.&quot; \r\nBefore the circuit court, the parties discussed Rule 5, SCRCrimP,\r\n  and section 56-5-2953 as the bases for upholding and reversing the municipal\r\n  court. Â The circuit court held that while the City &quot;alternatively asserts\r\n  that [the municipal court] erred in holding that [s]ection 56-5-2953 mandates\r\n  that the arresting officer provide McCollum an actual physical copy of the\r\n  Datamaster video, â€¦[b]ecause the Rule 5 violation provides an independent and\r\n  adequate support for the dismissal decision, the court need not address the\r\n  City's section 56-5-2953 argument.&quot;\r\nIn its brief to this court, the City argues in its first and\r\n  second issues on appeal that the municipal court judge erred in dismissing\r\n  McCollum's DUI charge under both Rule 5, SCRCrimP, (Issue I) and section\r\n  56-5-2953 (Issues I and II). Â The City's Issue III argues the circuit court\r\n  erred in affirming the municipal court under Rule 5 without examining\r\n  McCollum's &quot;failure to act with due diligence in viewing SLED's\r\n  website.&quot; Â Finally, in Issue IV, the City states the circuit court erred\r\n  in failing to address the municipal court's dismissal of McCollum's DUI charge\r\n  under section 56-5-2953.\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing criminal appeals from a municipal court, an appellate\r\n  court may only correct the circuit court's order for errors of law.Â  City of\r\n    Rock Hill v. Suchenski, 374 S.C. 12, 15, 646 S.E.2d 879, 880 (2007).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Dismissal\r\n  pursuant to Rule 5, SCRCrimP\r\nThe City first argues the municipal court erred in dismissing the\r\n  DUI charge against McCollum despite the City's compliance with the discovery\r\n  requirements of Rule 5 and the videotaping requirements of section 56-5-2953.Â  In\r\n  her response brief, McCollum argues the City has failed to preserve any issues\r\n  for appellate review because the City's issues on appeal assign no error to the\r\n  circuit court, but only address error by the municipal court judge.Â  We agree with\r\n  McCollum as to Issue I.\r\nAn appellant's brief must contain a concise and direct statement\r\n  of each issue presented to the appellate court for review. Â Rule 208(b)(1)(B),\r\n  SCACR.Â  &quot;Ordinarily, no point will be considered which is not set forth in\r\n  the statement of the issues on appeal.&quot; Â Id.Â  A party is bound by\r\n  the statement of his issues on appeal. Â Town of Sullivan's Island v. Felger,\r\n  318 S.C. 340, 350 n.3, 457 S.E.2d 626, 631 n.3 (Ct. App. 1995). Â Issue I asserts\r\n  only that &quot;[t]he municipal court judge erred in dismissing [McCollum's]\r\n  driving under the influence charge&quot; because the City complied with the\r\n  discovery requirements of Rule 5, SCRCrimP, and the videotaping requirements of\r\n  section 56-5-2953 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2009). Â Moreover, the\r\n  City's arguments under Issue I do not mention error on the part of the circuit\r\n  court. Â Thus, the City's statement of Issue I is insufficient to preserve any\r\n  error made by the circuit court.\r\nII.&nbsp; Compliance\r\n  with and Dismissal under Section 56-5-2953\r\nIn Issue II, the City contends the municipal court erred in\r\n  dismissing the DUI charge against McCollum when section 56-5-2953 provides that\r\n  failure to produce a videotape is not alone grounds for dismissal based upon\r\n  the totality of the circumstances.Â  In Issue IV, the City argues the circuit court erred in affirming the municipal\r\n  court's dismissal of the DUI charge without also addressing the City's\r\n  compliance with section 56-5-2953.Â  &quot;In criminal\r\n  cases, the appellate court sits only to review errors of law which have been\r\n  properly preserved, i.e., the issue has been raised to and ruled on by the trial\r\n  court.&quot;Â  State v. Wise, 359 S.C. 14, 21, 596 S.E.2d 475, 478\r\n  (2004).Â  Here, the circuit court did not rule on whether the City\r\n  complied with section 56-5-2953 or whether dismissal under that statute was\r\n  proper.Â  The record does not reflect the City sought a ruling on the statute\r\n  after the circuit court entered its order affirming based on Rule 5.Â \r\n  Accordingly, these issues are not preserved for our review.Â  Â Â \r\nIII.&nbsp; Due Diligence\r\nIn\r\n  Issue III, the City argues both the municipal and circuit courts erred in\r\n  dismissing the DUI charge against McCollum by finding the City failed to comply\r\n  with Rule 5, SCRCrimP, without examining McCollum's failure to act with due\r\n  diligence in viewing SLED's website.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nWe first note that there is no indication the municipal court\r\n  based its decision on a violation of Rule 5.Â  Rather, the record reflects the municipal court based its\r\n  decision solely upon the City's failure to comply with section 29-5-2953.Â  The\r\n  record does not indicate the City sought a ruling from the municipal court\r\n  concerning a violation of Rule 5 before filing its appeal to the circuit\r\n  court.Â  As a result, whether the City complied with Rule 5 was not properly before\r\n  the circuit court.Â  See Indigo Assoc. v. Ryan Inv. Co., 314 S.C.\r\n  519, 523, 431 S.E.2d 271, 273 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding a circuit court sitting\r\n  in its appellate capacity cannot consider questions not raised or ruled upon by\r\n  the lower court); see also State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 101, 606\r\n  S.E.2d 503, 505 (Ct. App. 2004) (stating that in reviewing criminal appeals\r\n  from the municipal court, the circuit court may review only preserved error\r\n  raised by appropriate exception).Â Â Â  \r\nThe circuit court's order does not expressly address the lack of\r\n  due diligence by McCollum in viewing the SLED website as it relates to section\r\n  56-5-2953.Â  As we read the circuit court's order, it holds that the videotape\r\n  was discoverable under Rule 5 and that the actions of the City in directing\r\n  McCollum to a website where the video could be viewed is insufficient\r\n  compliance with the rule where the evidence showed McCollum was not able to\r\n  view the videotape.Â  In fact, the court stated:\r\n\r\n\tIt would be difficult for the government\r\n  to rationally contend that it has fulfilled its obligation under Rule 5 to\r\n  allow the defendant to &quot;inspect and copy&quot; photographs and recorded\r\n  video statements by simply directing the party to a website on which the video\r\n  is stored. There is no evidence that a defendant or her lawyer can\r\n  independently copy the video from the website, or download it to some other\r\n  media.\r\n\r\nBecause the City\r\n  made no effort to extract a ruling from the circuit court based on McCollum's\r\n  lack of diligence under the statute, we affirm as to Issue III.\r\nIV.&nbsp; Affirmance\r\n  on Other Grounds Appearing in the Record\r\nAs\r\n  noted above, the City failed to preserve for appellate review its issues\r\n  relating to the application of section 56-5-2953.Â  However, we may affirm on any\r\n  ground appearing in the record.Â  See Rule 220(c), SCACR (&quot;The\r\n  appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, decision or judgment upon any\r\n  ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.&quot;); see also Moorhead\r\n    v. First Piedmont Bank and Trust Co., 273 S.C. 356, 360, 256 S.E.2d 414,\r\n  416 (1979).Â  We affirm based upon section 56-5-2953.Â  Â Â \r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina law mandates that the police videotape the conduct of a person who\r\n  drives a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol at the site of her breath\r\n  test using equipment provided by SLED.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2953(A) &amp; (D)\r\n  (Supp. 2009).Â  Furthermore:Â  \r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  video recording at the breath test site must: \r\n\t(a)\r\n  include the entire breath test procedure, the person being informed that he is\r\n  being video recorded, and that he has the right to refuse the test; \r\n\t(b)\r\n  include the person taking or refusing the breath test and the actions of the\r\n  breath test operator while conducting the test; and \r\n\t(c)\r\n  also include the person's conduct during the required twenty-minute pre-test\r\n  waiting period, unless the officer submits a sworn affidavit certifying that it\r\n  was physically impossible to video record this waiting period. \r\n\r\nÂ§&nbsp;56-5-2953(A)(2).Â  These\r\n  recordings are admissible in criminal proceedings.Â  Â§&nbsp;56-5-2953(A)(3).Â \r\n  The arresting officer's failure to produce such a video recording:\r\n\r\n\t[I]s\r\n  not alone a ground for dismissal . . . if the arresting officer submits a sworn\r\n  affidavit certifying that the video recording equipment at the time of the\r\n  arrest or probable cause determination, or video equipment at the breath test\r\n  facility was in an inoperable condition, stating which reasonable efforts have\r\n  been made to maintain the equipment in an operable condition, and certifying\r\n  that there was no other operable breath test facility available in the county\r\n  or, in the alternative, submits a sworn affidavit certifying that it was\r\n  physically impossible to produce the video recording because the person needed\r\n  emergency medical treatment, or exigent circumstances existed. . . .Â  Nothing\r\n  in this section prohibits the court from considering any other valid reason for\r\n  the failure to produce the video recording based upon the totality of the circumstances;\r\n  nor do the provisions of this section prohibit the person from offering\r\n  evidence relating to the arresting law enforcement officer's failure to produce\r\n  the video recording. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2953(B)\r\n  (Supp. 2009).\r\nOur\r\n  supreme court has previously entertained arguments against dismissal under this\r\n  statute and ruled:Â  \r\n\r\n\tUnder Â§\r\n  56-5-2953, a violation of the statute, with no mention of prejudice, may result\r\n  in dismissal of the charges. The statute provides, &quot;Failure by the\r\n  arresting officer to produce the videotapes required by this section is not\r\n    alone a ground for dismissal of any charge made pursuant to Section\r\n  56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, or 56-5-2945 if [exceptions apply] . . .&quot;\r\n  (emphasis added). Conversely, failure to produce videotapes would be a ground\r\n  for dismissal if no exceptions apply. \r\n\r\nCity of Rock Hill v.\r\n  Suchenski, 374 S.C. 12, 16, 646\r\n  S.E.2d 879, 881 (2007).Â  \r\nIn our opinion,\r\n  section 56-5-2953 and Suchenski apply to the instant case.Â  If the\r\n  prosecuting authority neither produces the video recording nor files an\r\n  affidavit explaining why it should be excepted from doing so, dismissal of the\r\n  charge is proper.Â  We recognize that Suchenski does not stand for the\r\n  proposition that a physical videotape must be furnished to each person charged\r\n  with DUI.Â  However, this narrow focus disregards the holding in Suchenski.Â \r\n  In that case, the videotape ran out during Suchenski's arrest, leaving no\r\n  recording of the last of three field sobriety tests.Â  Id. at 14, 646\r\n  S.E.2d at 879. Â As a result, the City of Rock Hill was incapable of providing a\r\n  complete video recording of Suchenski's arrest.Â  Id.Â  In its holding,\r\n  the Suchenski court interpreted the statute as permitting dismissal when\r\n  the prosecuting authority produced neither a videotape nor an affidavit.Â  Id. at 16, 646 S.E.2d at 881.Â  Here, the police officer uploaded the entire video\r\n  recording to SLED's website, and McCollum was provided with login information\r\n  to access the site.Â  However, after multiple attempts on different equipment,\r\n  McCollum could not view the entire video.Â  Despite her complaints that she was\r\n  unable to view the entire video and the municipal court's recommendation that\r\n  she be provided with a copy in another medium, the City refused to provide\r\n  McCollum a viewable copy of the video recording.Â  The municipal court did not\r\n  require the City to produce this recorded evidence on a physical videotape, but\r\n  rather, to take action to ensure McCollum could view the recording.Â  The City\r\n  could have made arrangements for McCollum to view the recording on its own\r\n  equipment or provided her a copy on CD or flash drive.Â  Because the City failed\r\n  to take any such action, it failed to meet its obligation to produce the\r\n  recording under Suchenski.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court's\r\n  decision.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the City's framing of Issue I failed to preserve for\r\n  appellate review any error by the circuit court on that issue.Â  In addition, we\r\n  find the City failed to preserve Issues II, III, and IV for appellate review by\r\n  seeking a post-judgment ruling thereon.Â  For these reasons and for other\r\n  reasons appearing in the record, the order of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nHUFF and GEATHERS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J. concur. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-243","title":"State v.

Lester, of Columbia, for Respondent John\r\n  Roe.\r\n\t\t\t\tLesley Williams Sercer, of Columbia, for Respondent Richard Roe.\r\n\t\t\t\tLarry Jerome Pearson, of Columbia, for Guardian ad Litem.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Jane Doe\r\n  (Mother) appeals the family court's removal of her son (Son) and daughters (Daughters)\r\n  and their placement into the custody of the South Carolina Department of Social\r\n  Services (DSS).Â  \r\nMother\r\n  appeals multiple orders of the family court related to the removal of Son and Daughters.\r\n  Â However, she articulates arguments against only two orders: (1) a September 2007\r\n  order finding Mother psychologically abused Son, removing Son, and taking Daughters\r\n  into emergency protective custody and (2) a December 2007 order removing Daughters.Â \r\n  Accordingly, this opinion focuses solely on the removal orders.Â  Mother's\r\n  appellate brief states custody of the children has gone to their respective\r\n  fathers, John Roe and Richard Roe (collectively, the Fathers), following\r\n  private custody actions.Â  \r\nMother\r\n  argues (1) the family court erred in finding &quot;spiritual coercion through\r\n  prayer&quot; was psychological abuse; (2) the family court erred in failing to\r\n  find Son's mental injury was proven by clear and convincing evidence; (3) she\r\n  was deprived of her due process rights in numerous ways; and (4) the family\r\n  court removal orders are not supported by sufficient facts in violation of Rule\r\n  26(a), SCRFC. Â DSS and the Fathers contend the appeal is moot because any\r\n  ruling will have no legal effect when the children's legal custody was decided\r\n  in private custody actions.Â  We find a preponderance of the evidence supported\r\n  removal, and we affirm for the following reasons: \r\n1.&nbsp; As to whether the appeal is moot,\r\n  we find the appeal is not moot because Mother's name was ordered to be placed\r\n  on the Central Registry for Abuse and Neglect as a result of Son's removal\r\n  order.Â  See Mathis v. S.C. State Highway Dep't, 260 S.C. 344,\r\n  346, 195 S.E.2d 713, 715 (1973) (&quot;A case becomes moot when judgment, if\r\n  rendered, will have no practical legal effect upon existing\r\n  controversy.&quot;); Collins Music Co. v. IGT, 365 S.C. 544, 549, 619\r\n  S.E.2d 1, 3 (Ct. App. 2005) (explaining an exception to the mootness doctrine\r\n  exists when the trial court's decision has collateral consequences to the\r\n  parties).Â  However, insofar as the children's custody has been determined in\r\n  private custody actions, the appeal is moot.Â  See McCoy v. McCoy,\r\n  283 S.C. 383, 385-86, 323 S.E.2d 517, 519 (1984) (holding an appeal of a family\r\n  court order granting temporary custody to DSS was moot when a subsequent\r\n  divorce action determined custody of the child).\r\n2.&nbsp; Regarding Mother's arguments\r\n  concerning prayer, the evidentiary standard for finding a mental injury, and\r\n  deprivation of due process, we find these issues are not preserved for our\r\n  review.Â  See King v. King, 384 S.C. 134, 142, 681 S.E.2d 609, 614\r\n  (Ct. App. 2009) (finding for an issue to be preserved it must have been raised\r\n  to and ruled upon by the trial court).Â  We note Mother objected at Daughters'\r\n  removal hearing to psychologist Dr. DeFelice's testimony, arguing it was speculative,\r\n  prejudicial, and inadmissible character evidence under Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â \r\n  However, Mother asserts on appeal the testimony was irrelevant hearsay that\r\n  violated her due process rights.Â  Accordingly, the issue is not preserved for\r\n  review on appeal.Â  See Wogan v. Kunze, 366 S.C. 583, 608-09, 623\r\n  S.E.2d 107, 121 (Ct. App. 2005) (finding a party may not argue one theory\r\n  before the trial court and another on appeal). \r\n3.&nbsp; As to whether the family court violated\r\n  Rule 26(a), SCRFC, we find the orders adequately provided the factual bases and\r\n  legal conclusions for their decisions. Â See Rule 26(a), SCRFC (&quot;An\r\n  order or judgment pursuant to an adjudication in a domestic relations case\r\n  shall set forth the specific findings of fact and conclusions of law to support\r\n  the court's decision.&quot;).\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the family court's orders removing\r\n  Son and Daughters.\r\nAFFIRMED.

Williams, Jr., Circuit Court\r\n  Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2010-UP-251\r\nSubmitted April 1, 2010 â€“ Filed April 26,\r\n  2010Â Â  \r\nREVERSED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART, \r\nAND VACATED IN PART\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIsiah James, Jr., pro se, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tLake Eric Summers, of Columbia, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Isiah\r\n  James, Jr., appeals the circuit court's order in this administrative grievance\r\n  action.Â  \r\nJames filed Step 1 and Step 2 grievances in accordance with the South\r\n  Carolina Department of Corrections' (the Department) Inmate Grievance System\r\n  Policy, alleging he was paid less than the prevailing wage while employed by\r\n  Kwalu in the Prison Industries System.Â  James further argued the Department\r\n  improperly deducted funds from his pay for room and board and victim\r\n  assistance. Â After the Department denied his grievances, James appealed\r\n  to the Administrative Law Court (ALC).Â  \r\nBy\r\n  order filed March 6, 2006 (Final Order), the ALC affirmed the Department as to\r\n  the deductions for room and board and victim assistance.Â  Â Â The\r\n  ALC determined, however, James was entitled to the prevailing wage of $5.25 per\r\n  hour and ordered the Department to pay James within thirty days the difference\r\n  between the wages owed and the wages previously paid. \r\nOn March 24, 2006, the ALC issued an &quot;Order of\r\n  Clarification.&quot;Â  The Order of Clarification referenced nine inmate\r\n  appeals, including James's appeal.Â  It stated the ALC received a letter[1] from the Department dated March 14,\r\n  2006, requesting clarification of compliance deadlines set forth in the Final\r\n  Order and other ALC orders concerning the nine inmate appeals.Â  The Order of\r\n  Clarification added: Â &quot;To avoid any further confusion, and to give the\r\n  Department adequate time to complete its work, it is hereby ORDERED that the\r\n  relief ordered in each case shall be completed by April 24th,\r\n    2006, thirty days from the file date of this order.&quot; (emphasis in\r\n  original) \r\nBoth\r\n  James and the Department appealed to the circuit court. Â James appealed on\r\n  March 28, 2006.Â  The Department filed its notice of appeal on April 20, 2006,\r\n  appealing all nine ALC orders referenced in the Order of Clarification. Â James\r\n  moved to dismiss the Department's appeal as untimely, arguing the Department\r\n  failed to file and serve its notice of appeal within thirty days from service\r\n  of the Final Order.Â  \r\nThe circuit court granted the Department's appeal and denied\r\n  James's appeal and motion to dismiss, holding the Department &quot;timely filed\r\n  its appeal in accordance with the orders issued by the ALC in this matter and\r\n  in conformity to the ALC's Rules of Procedure.&quot;Â  The circuit court\r\n  affirmed the ALC as to deductions for room and board and victim assistance.Â \r\n  However, with James's consent and agreement, the court remanded the prevailing\r\n  wage issue to the ALC. Â In addition, upon the Department's request, the circuit\r\n  court reversed the ALC's &quot;apparent ruling James worked for Kwalu or was\r\n  ever an employee of Kwalu.&quot; Â James appealed.\r\nJames argues the circuit court erred in: (1) denying his motion to\r\n  dismiss and finding the Department timely filed its notice of appeal from the ALC's\r\n  final order, and (2) affirming the ALC's holding that the Department properly\r\n  deducted funds from James's inmate pay for room and board and victim assistance\r\n  programs.Â  We reverse in part, affirm in part, and vacate in part.[2]\r\n1.&nbsp; We\r\n  reverse the circuit court's denial of James's motion to dismiss the\r\n  Department's appeal to the circuit court because the Department did not timely\r\n  file its notice of appeal.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610 (Supp. 2009) (providing an appeal from a final decision\r\n  of the ALC must be filed with the court of appeals and served on the opposing\r\n  party not more than thirty days after the party receives the final decision); Elam\r\n    v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 17, 602 S.E.2d 772, 776 (2004)\r\n  (holding timeliness of an appeal is a jurisdictional matter). Â The Department's\r\n  letter requesting clarification of the ALC's final order did not toll the\r\n  Department's time period for filing and serving its appeal.Â  Initially, we note\r\n  the letter was not a motion, and it did not appear in our record on appeal.Â \r\n  More importantly, the Department did not ask the ALC to alter, amend, modify,\r\n  or even clarify the judgment; rather, the Department asked the ALC to clarify\r\n  the deadline by which the Department had to pay the judgment.Â  Because we hold\r\n  the circuit court was without jurisdiction to entertain the Department's\r\n  appeal, we vacate all portions of the circuit court order that address issues\r\n  raised only by the Department.Â  Specifically, we vacate the circuit court's\r\n  reversal of the ALC's &quot;apparent ruling&quot; that James worked for Kwalu.Â \r\n  We address issues raised in James's timely appeal to the circuit court below.Â Â  \r\n\r\n2.&nbsp; We affirm the ALC's holding that the Department properly deducted\r\n  funds from James's inmate pay for room and board and victim assistance\r\n  programs.Â  \r\n&quot;The\r\n  General Assembly shall establish institutions for the confinement of all\r\n  persons convicted of such crimes as may be designated by law, and shall provide\r\n  for the custody, maintenance, health, welfare, education, and rehabilitation of\r\n  the inmates.&quot;&nbsp; S.C. Const. art. XII, Â§ 2.&nbsp; Section 24-1-130 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code of Laws (Supp. 2009) vests the Director of the\r\n  Department with &quot;the management of the affairs of the prison system and\r\n  for the proper care, treatment, feeding, clothing, and management of the\r\n  prisoners confined therein.&quot;\r\nSection\r\n  24-3-40(A) of the South Carolina Code of Laws (Supp. 2009) permits the\r\n  Department to deduct money from &quot;the gross wages of [a] prisoner&quot;\r\n  authorized to work in a prison industries program.Â  Sections 24-3-40(A)(1) and\r\n  (2) require a deduction of 20% of a prisoner's gross prison industries wages to\r\n  be directed to fulfill the prisoner's court ordered restitution, or if the\r\n  prisoner has no court ordered restitution obligation, to be applied to &quot;the\r\n  State Office of Victim Assistance.&quot;Â  Section 24-3-40(A)(3) provides: &quot;If\r\n  there are no child support obligations, then twenty-five percent must be used\r\n  by the Department of Corrections to defray the cost of the prisoner's room and\r\n  board.&quot;\r\nJames's\r\n  argument that the deductions violate South Carolina constitutional and\r\n  statutory law is without merit.Â  There is no conflict betweenÂ  article XII, section 2, of the South Carolina\r\n  Constitution and section 24-3-40 (A) of\r\n  the South Carolina Code of Laws. Â The\r\n  language set forth in article XII, section 2, requiring that prisons\r\n  &quot;provide for&quot; prisoners' custody has no specific application to\r\n  prison industries wage deductions and does not mandate that the Department incur\r\n  all costs of incarceration.Â  See Brown v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp;\r\n    Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 515, 560 S.E.2d 410, 414 (2002) (&quot;An\r\n  appellate court cannot construe a statute without regard to its plain meaning\r\n  and may not resort to a forced interpretation in an attempt to expand or limit\r\n  the scope of a statute.&quot;).Â  Further, our supreme court has held article\r\n  XII, section 2, should be interpreted broadly.Â  See Sullivan v. S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Corr., 355 S.C. 437, 444, 586 S.E.2d 124, 127 (2003) (holding even\r\n  if article XII, section 2, is read to require some rehabilitation for inmates,\r\n  it does not mandate any specific programs or any particular timetable for\r\n  furnishing rehabilitation). \r\nFurther,\r\n  there is no conflict between section 24-1-130\r\n  and section 24-3-40(A).Â  Although section 24-1-130 charges the Department's\r\n  director with caring for and feeding prisoners, the section does not require\r\n  the Department to assume all costs associated with the prisoners' welfare.\r\nJames\r\n  does not assert any authority for his argument that the deductions are\r\n  discriminatory or that they violate his due process rights. See In re\r\n    McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 92, 551 S.E.2d 235, 238 (2001) (holding an issue is\r\n  abandoned on appeal if the argument is not supported by authority or is conclusory).Â \r\n  Likewise, James fails to prove he was double-charged for room and board.Â \r\n  Although James references an earnings and deductions statement, the record does not indicate the cost the Department\r\n  expended for James's housing or the total amount James claims was deducted from\r\n  his wages to pay for room and housing.Â  See State v.\r\n    Mitchell, 330 S.C. 189, 199, 498\r\n  S.E.2d 642, 647 (1998) (holding the appellant has the burden of presenting a\r\n  sufficient record for our review).\r\nJames's\r\n  argument that his pay was deducted without a hearing is without merit.Â  James\r\n  has been afforded hearings pursuant to the grievance system, and he appealed to\r\n  the ALC, the circuit court, and now this court.Â Â  Nothing further is required\r\n  by law or due process.Â  See Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 376-82,\r\n  527 S.E.2d 742, 754-57 (2000) (setting forth an inmate's procedural rights from\r\n  grievance claims).\r\nFinally,\r\n  James's reference to restitution is without merit because section\r\n  24-3-40(A)(2), which mandates pay deductions for victim assistance, is distinct\r\n  from restitution.\r\nREVERSED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART, AND VACATED IN PART.\r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This letter does not appear in our record on appeal.\r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-252","title":"Gregory v.

Martin, of Myrtle Beach, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Patricia C. Gregory and H. Jackson Gregory appeal a circuit court order denying the return of\r\n  their earnest money in connection with a failed real estate transaction.Â  The\r\n  Gregorys argue they should be insulated from default and allowed to obtain a\r\n  refund of their earnest money deposit because the contract contained a\r\n  contingency clause for obtaining financing, and their lender refused funding\r\n  through no fault of either party. Â Thus, the Gregorys contend the circuit court\r\n  erred in denying the return of their earnest money.Â  We agree, and now reverse\r\n  and remand for entry of an order directing the return of the earnest money to\r\n  the Gregorys.[1]Â  \r\nThe Gregorys entered into a\r\n  real estate contract with Courtney Lyn Tayloe to purchase a condominium in\r\n  Myrtle Beach for $89,000. Â The contract required an earnest money deposit\r\n  in the amount of $1,000 to be held in escrow by David E. Martin, the attorney\r\n  who drafted the purchase contract.Â  The contract\r\n  expressly provided &quot;Buyer's obligation under this Contract is contingent\r\n  on Buyer obtaining financing.&quot; Â The contract did not contain a\r\n  forfeiture clause in the event of default.Â  \r\n&quot;The\r\n  cardinal rule of contract interpretation is to ascertain and give effect to the\r\n  intention of the parties.&quot; Â Chan v. Thompson, 302 S.C. 285, 289, 395\r\n  S.E.2d 731, 734 (Ct. App. 1990). Â In determining the intention of the parties,\r\n  the court first looks to the language of the contract. Â C.A.N. Enters., Inc.\r\n    v. S.C. Health and Human Serv. Fin. Comm'n, 296 S.C. 373, 377, 373 S.E.2d\r\n  584, 586 (1988). Â When the contract language is perfectly plain and capable of\r\n  legal construction, the language alone determines the contract's full force and\r\n  effect. Â Conner v. Alvarez, 285 S.C. 97, 101, 328 S.E.2d 334, 336\r\n  (1985).Â  \r\nThe Gregorys made a good faith effort to obtain financing, but\r\n  their lender refused funding due to a secondary financing clause in the\r\n  purchase contract.Â  Both Tayloe and Martin were aware of the secondary\r\n  financing clause, especially in light of the fact that Martin drafted the\r\n  contract of sale.Â  Indeed, Tayloe\r\n  and Martin conceded in their brief that failure of a financing contingency\r\n  would ordinarily excuse the Gregorys from liability under the contract with\r\n  Tayloe.[2]Â  Therefore, the contingency clause in this case operates to\r\n  insulate the Gregorys from all liability.Â  Compare Storen v. Meadors, 295 S.C. 438, 440, 369 S.E.2d 651, 652\r\n  (Ct. App. 1988) (finding a prospective buyer was excused from performance under\r\n  a real estate purchase contract with a financing contingency clause when the\r\n  buyer made a good faith effort to obtain financing), with Hamilton v.\r\n    Harborview Dev. Partners, 293 S.C. 226, 228, 359 S.E.2d 516, 517 (Ct. App.\r\n  1987) (holding a prospective buyer was not entitled to a\r\n  refund of his deposit on a real estate purchase contract when buyer did not\r\n  make a good faith effort to obtain financing, and when the contract expressly\r\n  stated sellers could retain the deposit in the event of default).\r\nFinally, even if the Gregorys had defaulted on their contractual\r\n  obligations, the contract did not contain a provision for automatic forfeiture\r\n  of the earnest money to the non-defaulting party.Â  The contract merely provided\r\n  that &quot;in the event of any controversy or disagreement concerning said\r\n  earnest money, Escrow Agent shall be entitled to refrain from any and all\r\n  action until both Buyer and Seller agree in writing to the satisfaction of the\r\n  Escrow Agent as to the disposition of the earnest money . . . .&quot;Â  Because\r\n  there was no forfeiture clause, the Gregorys were entitled to a refund of their\r\n  earnest money regardless of the reasons why the contract fell through.Â  See 92A C.J.S. Vendor and Purchaser Â§ 646 (&quot;On\r\n  the failure of negotiations for a sale of land, the purchaser may recover a\r\n  deposit made by him or her if there is no provision for forfeiture.&quot;).Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the decision of the circuit court is\r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nPIEPER\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Tayloe and Martin submit the Gregorys' current\r\n  argument is unpreserved for appeal.Â  We disagree, and find this issue is\r\n  preserved pursuant to Bartles v.\r\n    Livingston, 282 S.C. 448, 464, 319\r\n  S.E.2d 707, 716&nbsp;(Ct.

Elliott, and Assistant Deputy Attorney General Julie M. Thames, all of Columbia;\r\n  and Solicitor David Michael Pascoe, of Orangeburg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  George B.\r\n  Senior appeals his convictions for criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the\r\n  first degree and lewd act upon a child.Â  Senior argues the trial court erred in\r\n  excluding testimony concerning whether the victim had been sexually assaulted\r\n  by a third party.Â  Specifically, Senior contends he was unable to present\r\n  evidence that the victim's behavioral problems resulted from a third-party\r\n  assault.Â  We affirm.\r\nOrdinarily, an appellate court will not review an\r\n  alleged error regarding the exclusion of testimony unless a proffer of\r\n  testimony is properly made on the record. Â State\r\n    v. Schmidt, 288 S.C. 301, 303, 342 S.E.2d 401, 402-03&nbsp;(1986).Â  Absent\r\n  a proffer, it is impossible for an appellate court to determine the effect of\r\n  the excluded testimony.Â  Baber v. Greenville County, 327 S.C. 31, 41,\r\n  488 S.E.2d 314, 319 (1997).Â  However, where the trial court refuses to allow\r\n  the proffer, and the appellate court can determine from the record what the\r\n  testimony was intended to show, the appellate court may address the merits.Â  Schmidt,\r\n  288 S.C. at 303, 342 S.E.2d at 403. Â \r\nSenior's counsel did not attempt to proffer testimony\r\n  from either the mental health therapist or the psychiatrist regarding whether\r\n  anal penetration was reported as part of victim's prior history of abuse.Â  However,\r\n  Senior's counsel did attempt to proffer testimony from Dr. Betsy Gibbs, the sex\r\n  therapist who took the forensic information from the victim. Â The trial\r\n  court denied counsel's proffer request on the grounds the question was\r\n  irrelevant.Â  Thus, although the proffer attempt was unsuccessful, this\r\n  issue is preserved to the extent this court can determine from the record what the\r\n  testimony was intended to show.Â  See Schmidt, 288 S.C. at 303,\r\n  342 S.E.2d at 403. \r\nReaching the merits, counsel's intended question\r\n  provides no evidentiary support for Senior's current argument.Â  Counsel stated &quot;anal\r\n  penetration starts with other stuff,&quot; implying she intended to ask Dr.\r\n  Gibbs whether a person who commits a sexual assault involving anal penetration\r\n  generally commits prior sexual assaults involving other body parts.Â  Counsel\r\n  did not suggest that the alleged perpetrator of both acts was not Senior, nor\r\n  did she suggest the other perpetrator could have caused the victim's behavioral\r\n  problems instead of Senior.Â  Counsel's implied line of questioning would not\r\n  serve to exculpate Senior; thus, Senior suffered no prejudice from the\r\n  exclusion of the proposed testimony. \r\nIn addition, this evidence does not fall within any of\r\n  the recognized exceptions to the Rape Shield Statute.Â  See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 16-3-659.1(1) (2003).Â  Counsel's implied line of questioning would not\r\n  provide an alternative source to explain the victim's sexual knowledge, nor\r\n  would it impeach the victim's credibility.Â  See State v. Finley,\r\n  300 S.C. 196, 200, 387 S.E.2d 88, 90 (1989) (holding the trial court improperly\r\n  excluded evidence that a female victim engaged in a sexual encounter with\r\n  another man in defendant's presence to show the victim had motive to falsely\r\n  accuse the defendant); State v. Grovenstein, 340 S.C. 210, 220, 530\r\n  S.E.2d 406, 412 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding evidence of three male victims' prior\r\n  sexual conduct was relevant to Grovenstein's defense as an alternate\r\n  explanation of how the victims possessed knowledge of the alleged sexual\r\n  assault by Grovenstein);Â  State v. Lang, 304 S.C. 300, 301-02, 403\r\n  S.E.2d 677, 678 (Ct. App. 1991) (holding the trial court improperly excluded\r\n  evidence of the victim's homosexuality to impeach the credibility of the victim\r\n  when the victim denied his homosexuality on direct examination).\r\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in\r\n  excluding testimony regarding an alleged sexual assault of the victim by a\r\n  third party.Â  Accordingly, Senior's conviction is\r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nPIEPER\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-257","title":"Payne v.
