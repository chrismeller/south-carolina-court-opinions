Guess, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-407\r\nSubmitted April 6, 2004 â€“ Filed June \r\n  23, 2004\r\nRevised &amp; Refiled September 10, \r\n  2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART,\r\nAND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJohn D. Elliott, of Columbia, for Appellant.Â  \r\nNicole and Curtis Piper of York, Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Joselene S. Small appeals the family courtâ€™s order requiring \r\n  her to pay one-half of the guardian ad litemâ€™s (Guardianâ€™s) fees, one-half of \r\n  the guardianâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees, and a substantial portion of Nicole and Curtis \r\n  Piperâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. \r\n  [1]   \r\nFACTS\r\nNicole Piper and Robert Weaver were divorced in 1993.Â  Piper was \r\n  granted custody of the partiesâ€™ two minor children with visitation rights for \r\n  Weaver.Â  In 1996, Weaverâ€™s visitation was restricted to permit visits only under \r\n  the supervision of the childrenâ€™s paternal grandparents, Joselene and Paul Small.Â  \r\n  Later that year, Weaver was incarcerated and the family court issued a temporary \r\n  order allowing the Smalls to continue visitation.Â  The Smalls exercised this \r\n  visitation until Weaver was released from prison in 1997.Â  Afterward, Weaver \r\n  resumed visitation supervised by the Smalls.Â  \r\nIn 2000, Piper brought this action against Weaver and Joselene Small \r\n  to suspend visitation.Â  Weaver and Small counterclaimed for custody and requested \r\n  Piper be held in contempt for refusing to allow visitation.Â  The court appointed \r\n  a guardian ad litem to represent the interests of the children.Â  The guardian \r\n  hired an attorney to represent her. \r\nThe family courtâ€™s final order terminated Smallâ€™s visitation and \r\n  suspended Weaverâ€™s pending a determination if it would be in the best interest \r\n  of the children for his visits to resume.Â  The court also found Piperâ€™s decision \r\n  to stop the visitation was not contemptuous.Â  The order required Small and Piper \r\n  to each pay one-half of the fee awarded to the guardian and one-half of the \r\n  guardianâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The court also required Small to pay a substantial \r\n  portion of attorneyâ€™s fees incurred by Piper and her husband.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nIn appeals from the \r\n  family court, we may find the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence. Â This broad scope of review does not, however, require us to \r\n  disregard the findings of the family court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses \r\n  and was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative \r\n  weight to their testimony.Â  Hollar v. Hollar, 342 S.C. 463, 472, 536 \r\n  S.E.2d 883, 887 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\nI.Â  Guardianâ€™s \r\n  Authority to Hire an Attorney\r\nSmall contends the family court \r\n  erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to the guardianâ€™s attorney, arguing the guardian \r\n  improperly retained counsel without obtaining prior authorization from the family \r\n  court.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt the time this case \r\n  was before the family court, there was no requirement for a guardian to seek \r\n  prior approval from the court before retaining counsel. [2] Â  However, Rule 12, SCRFC provides that â€œ[i]f a guardian ad \r\n  litem is represented by an attorney, the court in its discretion may assess \r\n  reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees and costs.â€Â  Accordingly, if the guardian ad litem \r\n  did not seek and obtain prior approval from the court for the hiring of an attorney, \r\n  then the guardian assumed the risk that the court might not allow a fee.Â  In \r\n  this case, the court subsequently approved the attorneyâ€™s hiring and awarded \r\n  modified fees, exercising its inherent power to protect the best interests of \r\n  the children and its discretionary authority under Rule 12.Â  \r\nAfter Small complained in a pre-trial \r\n  motion that counsel for the guardian was not authorized, the court responded \r\n  by issuing an order requiring the guardianâ€™s attorney to participate in the \r\n  action.Â  In the final order, the court addressed Smallâ€™s concern directly, stating:\r\n\r\nIn making this award, \r\n  the Court is cognizant of the fact that the Guardian ad Litem retained \r\n  [counsel] without prior approval of the Court.Â  It should be noted that a Guardian \r\n  ad Litem will not in all instances be awarded attorneyâ€™s fees unless the Court \r\n  has approved the appointment of such an attorney.Â  The Court has decided to \r\n  award an attorneyâ€™s fee . . . because the issue of whether or not he was to \r\n  be involved in this case has been dealt with in a pre-trial motion by [Smallâ€™s] \r\n  attorney.Â  After that motion, the Order issued did not relieve [counsel] of \r\n  his duties but, to the contrary, gave [him] [a specific duty] . . . . [T]he \r\n  Court has come to the conclusion that [counselâ€™s] involvement in this case was \r\n  necessary and that he did so as an advocate for the best interest of the children.\r\n\r\nIn light of the family courtâ€™s \r\n  requirement that the guardianâ€™s counsel participate in the case and the final \r\n  order stating his involvement was necessary, we conclude the court did not abuse \r\n  its discretion in making an award.Â  \r\nA guardian \r\n  ad litem is entitled to compensation for his services and reimbursement for \r\n  necessary expenses.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs.&nbsp;v. Hyatt, \r\n  277 S.C. 152, 154, 283 S.E.2d 445, 446 (1981).Â  â€œIn fixing the amount of compensation \r\n  to be paid to a guardian ad litem, a court should consider the \r\n  character of the litigation, the issues involved, the services performed, the \r\n  care and diligence exhibited, and the results achieved.â€Â  Id.Â  This court \r\n  will not disturb the amount of a fee award to a guardian ad litem absent an \r\n  abuse of discretion.Â  Nash v. Byrd, 298 S.C. 530, 537, 381 S.E.2d 913, \r\n  917 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  Likewise, we recognize that an award for attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  is left to the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed \r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, \r\n  415, 368 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1988).\r\nIn a temporary \r\n  order, the family court required Small, Piper, and Weaver to each contribute \r\n  $700 toward the guardianâ€™s anticipated fees and costs.Â  The $2,100 was paid \r\n  into the trust account of Weaverâ€™s attorney who was to pay the guardianâ€™s bills \r\n  unless one of the parties objected.Â  The guardian was required to provide copies \r\n  of her monthly billing statements to each of the parties.Â  \r\nWeaverâ€™s attorney paid \r\n  the guardianâ€™s first invoice in full.Â  There is no evidence in the record to \r\n  indicate Small objected to this initial payment.Â  The guardian submitted three \r\n  more bills that remained unpaid at the time of the final order.Â  \r\nIn its final order, the family \r\n  court awarded the guardian additional fees and costs of $2,395.30 based on the \r\n  last three unpaid invoices, and attorneyâ€™s fees of $6,348.40.Â  The court also \r\n  approved the previously paid invoice of $1,531.20 as billed. [3] Â  Small was required to pay one-half \r\n  of the additional fee awarded to the guardian and one-half of the guardianâ€™s \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees, for a total of $4,371.85.Â  \r\nIn making the \r\n  fee award to the guardian, the court reduced her hourly rate by $10 from the \r\n  amount requested.Â  The court made the reduction after considering the absence \r\n  of overhead and other business expenses, as well as the intensity and urgency \r\n  of the work required.Â  The court stated it reviewed the entire file as well \r\n  as the guardianâ€™s bills and concluded all of the billed time was compensable \r\n  and was necessarily spent fulfilling duties and acting in the best interest \r\n  of the children.Â  The family court noted the guardian worked with speed and \r\n  diligence and had, through her efforts to promptly secure court-ordered psychological \r\n  evaluations, moved the case toward a timely resolution.Â  Finally, the court \r\n  expressly noted it had â€œtaken into consideration to a large extent the financial \r\n  condition of the parties . . . and the other fees and expenses each must necessarily \r\n  pay as a result of the litigation.â€Â  The family court relied upon the detailed \r\n  invoices submitted by the guardian and considered all relevant factors when \r\n  making the compensation award.Â  Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion \r\n  in the amount of the fee awarded.Â  \r\nThe court also found \r\n  the guardian would not have been able to effectively fulfill her duty as an \r\n  advocate for the best interest of the children without the assistance of counsel.Â  \r\n  However, in making the award of attorneyâ€™s fees, the court reduced counselâ€™s \r\n  hourly rate substantially, from $150 to $90 per hour based on:Â  1) the relative \r\n  inability of the parties to pay the approximately $10,500 fee requested in his \r\n  affidavit and billing statement; 2) application of the factors outlined in Glasscock \r\n  v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403 S.E.2d 313 (1991), including an evaluation \r\n  of the difficulty of the case; and 3) findings that a significant amount of \r\n  counselâ€™s billed time arose from hearings that required minimal participation \r\n  and preparation.Â  Finally, the court granted the parties six months from the \r\n  date of the order to pay the attorneyâ€™s fees or make arrangements for terms \r\n  with the guardianâ€™s counsel.Â  The court relied upon the affidavit of counsel \r\n  and adequately considered the Glasscock factors.Â  Therefore, we find \r\n  no abuse of discretion in the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees awarded.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Award of \r\n  Attorneyâ€™s Fees and Costs to Nicole and Curtis Piper\r\nFinally, Small contends the family \r\n  court erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees and costs to Nicole and Curtis Piper \r\n  without making specific findings to support the awards and without properly \r\n  considering the Glasscock factors.Â  Small also argues the family court \r\n  should have considered her ability to pay.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nWhen a court decides \r\n  whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees it should consider the partiesâ€™ ability to \r\n  pay their own fees, the beneficial results obtained by counsel, the respective \r\n  financial conditions of the parties, and the effect of the fee award on each \r\n  partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, \r\n  415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  When the court sets the amount of the fee award, \r\n  it must also consider the nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered, \r\n  the time necessarily devoted to the case, counselâ€™s professional standing, the \r\n  contingency of compensation, the beneficial results obtained, and the customary \r\n  legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock, 304 S.C. at 161, 403 S.E.2d \r\n  at 315.Â  It is insufficient for a court to make a general reference to these \r\n  requirements without more.Â  If there is inadequate evidentiary support for the \r\n  factors to be considered in making such an award, the appellate court should \r\n  reverse and remand for the family court to make specific findings.Â  Haselden \r\n  v. Haselden, 347 S.C. 48, 66, 552 S.E.2d 329, 338 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nThe family court awarded the \r\n  Pipers a total of $13,619 in attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  The order required \r\n  Small to make full payment in equal monthly installments within thirty-six months \r\n  beginning sixty days from the date of the final order.Â  In making the award, \r\n  the court did not consider the factors enunciated in E.D.M. v. T.A.M., \r\n  307 S.C. at 476-77, 415 S.E.2d at 816.Â  Moreover, the court failed to make any \r\n  specific findings under Glasscock, stating only that the award was made \r\n  â€œafter considering all requirements of the Glasscock case.â€Â  \r\nWe recognize Nicole \r\n  Piper prevailed in her claim for termination of Smallâ€™s visitation and successfully \r\n  defended against Smallâ€™s cross-claims.Â  We are also aware the family court concluded \r\n  Curtis Piper was, contrary to Smallâ€™s contentions, a fit and proper parent.Â  \r\n  However, the award of attorneyâ€™s fees to the Pipers fails to take into consideration \r\n  Smallâ€™s ability to pay the amounts awarded and is not supported by specific \r\n  findings of fact.Â  \r\nUnder the terms of the order, \r\n  Small is required to pay a total ofÂ  $20,055.35 in fees and costs.Â  According \r\n  to her financial declaration, her own attorneyâ€™s fees exceeded $19,000.Â  She \r\n  and her husband are retired and live on a combined gross annual income of $27,360.Â  \r\n  Smallâ€™s personal retirement income nets slightly over $1,000 per month.Â  Even \r\n  with the payment schedules established by the order, Small is required to pay \r\n  the psychologist and guardian approximately $3,000 immediately.Â  She then has \r\n  a six-month grace period to arrange payment terms with the guardianâ€™s counsel \r\n  for payment of the additional $3,174.20.Â  Sixty days after the date of the final \r\n  order, she is required to start making at least thirty-six equal monthly payments \r\n  of $377.77 to satisfy her portion of the Pipersâ€™ attorneyâ€™s fees. [4] Â  In light of these facts, we conclude the additional \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees awarded to the Pipers requires analysis under the E.D.M. \r\n  v. T.A.M. factors.Â  We further find the family court failed to properly \r\n  consider the Glasscock factors when setting the amount of the award.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we reverse and remand this issue with specific instructions to \r\n  allow additional evidence on the issue of the appropriateness and amount of \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees and to make specific findings of fact as to each of the six \r\n  Glasscock factors. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the family court properly \r\n  approved of the guardianâ€™s decision to obtain counsel, and affirm the award \r\n  of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We also affirm the amount of fees awarded to both the guardian \r\n  and her counsel.Â  We reverse the award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Nicole and Curtis \r\n  Piper and remand this issue for re-determination under the factors enunciated \r\n  in Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991), \r\n  and E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  \r\n\r\n AFFIRMED IN PART, \r\n  REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ., and \r\n  CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule \r\n    215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In 2002, the legislature passed the South Carolina Guardian \r\n    Ad Litem Reform Act.Â  The Act was codified into law in January 2003 and is \r\n    not applicable to this case.Â  See S.C.

Clare, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General \r\n          John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, \r\n          all of Columbia; and Solicitor Edgar Lewis Clements, III, of Florence, \r\n          for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Julian Ab Romero pled guilty to common law robbery.Â  The \r\n  trial court sentenced him to imprisonment for thirteen and half years.Â  Romero \r\n  appeals, arguing his sentence is so disproportionate to the offense it constitutes \r\n  unconstitutional cruel and unusual punishment.Â  On appeal, Romeroâ€™s counsel \r\n  filed a brief pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), \r\n  asserting the appeal is without legal merit sufficient to warrant a new trial \r\n  and requesting permission to withdraw from further representation of Romero.Â  \r\n  Romero has not filed a pro se brief. Â Â We find Romeroâ€™s appeal \r\n  to be without merit.\r\nSection 16-11-325 of the South Carolina Code states, upon conviction of common \r\n  law robbery, â€œa person must be imprisoned not more than fifteen years.â€Â  S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-325 (2003).Â  Generally, if a statute fixing the punishment \r\n  for an offense is not unconstitutional, a sentence within the limits prescribed \r\n  by such statute will not be regarded as cruel and unusual.Â  State v. Kimbrough, \r\n  212 S.C. 348, 354, 46 S.E.2d 273, 275-76 (1948).Â  This presumption of validity \r\n  places the heavy burden on an appellant of persuading this court that the sentence \r\n  is without justification and â€œshocks the collective conscience of our society.â€Â  \r\n  Stockton v. Leeke, 269 S.C. 459, 237 S.E.2d 896 (1977).\r\nRomeroâ€™s rather conclusory arguments fail to satisfy this hefty burden.Â  Although \r\n  the victimâ€™s property was eventually recovered, Romero used extreme violence \r\n  to forcibly obtain the property.Â  Furthermore, he has an extensive prior record, \r\n  including convictions for larceny, assault, DUI, aggravated sexual battery, \r\n  and â€œlesser homicide.â€Â  Despite these factors, the trial judge still did not \r\n  give Romero the maximum sentence allowed by the statute (15 years).Â  There is \r\n  no merit to Romeroâ€™s argument.\r\nAfter a thorough review of the record and counselâ€™s brief pursuant to Anders \r\n  and State v. Williams, 305 S.C. 116, 406 S.E.2d 357 (1991), we dismiss \r\n  Romeroâ€™s appeal and grant counselâ€™s motion to be relieved. \r\n  [1]  \r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED. [2] \r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Six months prior to the hearing, a trial judge \r\n    ordered a psychological evaluation of Romero pursuant to S.C.

Randolph Whitt, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is a mortgage foreclosure \r\n  action.Â  Katharine Brown appeals from the master-in-equityâ€™s order finding she \r\n  â€œfailed to meet her burden of proof in establishing any defense to the foreclosure \r\n  action.â€Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nOn September 29, 1995, Brown executed and delivered a promissory note to Ford \r\n  Consumer Finance Company, Inc. (Ford), the predecessor in interest of Ocwen \r\n  Federal Savings Bank, FSB (Ocwen).Â  Pursuant to the note, Brown promised to \r\n  pay to Ford the principal sum of $41,676, with interest at the rate of 13.10 \r\n  percent per annum.Â  The note was secured by a mortgage given by Brown to Ford \r\n  covering property located at 149 Crane Creek Drive in Richland County.Â  The \r\n  mortgage was thereafter assigned to Ocwen.\r\nOcwen instituted this action against Brown seeking a foreclosure of the mortgage \r\n  and a sale of the property.Â  â€œAssociates Financial Serv., Richland Memorial \r\n  Hosp/Charles Hallman, Sun Finance and Ford Motor Credit Companyâ€ were made parties \r\n  by virtue of the fact that they may have or claim to have some right, title, \r\n  interest in or lien upon the real property as judgment creditors.Â  Brown was \r\n  â€œ[t]he titleholder[] of record of the . . . propertyâ€ to be foreclosed.Â  An \r\n  order compelling discovery responses required Brown to produce any evidence \r\n  she had of payment on the note and mortgage by April 9, 2002.\r\nThe master-in-equity held a foreclosure hearing.Â  The master found the note \r\n  and mortgage were in default and ordered foreclosure of the mortgage and sale \r\n  of the subject property at public auction.Â  Further, the master determined the \r\n  â€œ[p]rincipal amount due as of April 22, 2002â€ was $41,200.08, with interest \r\n  â€œfrom June 4, 1998 to June 17, 2002 at the rate of 13.10 [percent] per annumâ€ \r\n  totaling $22,067.03.Â  The Judgment of Foreclosure and Sale was dated July 11, \r\n  2002, and filed on July 16, 2002.\r\nOn August 2, 2002, Brown filed a motion to alter \r\n  or amend judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  In the motion, Brown asserted \r\n  the judgment â€œshould be altered or amended to make a finding of a failure to \r\n  comply with the attorney preference requirementâ€ because she â€œpresented uncontested \r\n  evidence that the Plaintiffâ€™s predecessor-in-interest, Ford Motor Credit Corporation, \r\n  failed to advise her of her right to select her own attorney.â€Â  At the hearing, \r\n  counsel for Brown noted: â€œ[T]he order did not address specifically the preference \r\n  issues.Â  And thatâ€™s what we would like to have altered or amended, that portion \r\n  of the judgment, so that it specifically addresses the preference issues.â€Â  \r\n  The master granted Brownâ€™s motion to alter or amend the judgment to include \r\n  his decision regarding the attorney preference issue.\r\nThe subject property was sold at foreclosure sale \r\n  on August 5, 2002.Â  An order confirming the sale was filed on November 26, 2002.Â  \r\n  Brownâ€™s second motion to alter or amend the judgment of foreclosure and sale \r\n  was dated December 6, 2002.Â  Brown based â€œthis motion upon the grounds that \r\n  she has previously taken the position that she has paid the mortgage [in full] \r\n  in this case, and that she has now presented documentary evidence to support \r\n  that position.â€Â  Brown averred the foreclosure should not â€œhave gone forward, \r\n  and therefore she is entitled to have it essentially unraveled and to put the \r\n  property back for sale.â€Â  This motion was denied by order dated January 29, \r\n  2003, and filed on February 6, 2003.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action to foreclose a real \r\n  estate mortgage is an action in equity.Â  Hayne Fed. Credit Union v. Bailey, \r\n  327 S.C. 242, 489 S.E.2d 472 (1997); Swindler v. Swindler, 355 S.C. 245, \r\n  584 S.E.2d 438 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  On appeal from an action in equity, this court \r\n  is not required to disregard the findings of the master.Â  BB &amp; T v. Kidwell, \r\n  350 S.C. 382, 565 S.E.2d 316 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  The master, who saw and heard \r\n  the witnesses, was in a better position to assess their credibility and the \r\n  weight that should be given to their testimony.Â  See Jocoy v. Jocoy, \r\n  349 S.C. 441, 562 S.E.2d 674 (Ct. App. 2002) (explaining that while the standard \r\n  of review in equity cases permits an appellate court a broad scope of review, \r\n  the court does not disregard the findings of the master-in-equity, who saw and \r\n  heard the witnesses and was in a better position to evaluate their credibility).Â  \r\n  However, this court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.Â  Taylor v. Lindsey, 332 S.C. 1, 498 S.E.2d 862 (1998); \r\n  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 \r\n  (1976).\r\nLAW\r\nDefense of Payment\r\nBrown argues the master-in-equity erred in finding she â€œhad not paid the balance \r\n  on the note and mortgage in full.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nBrown claims she presented evidence that demonstrates she â€œhad paid at least \r\n  a substantial portion of this balance due.â€Â  Brown contended she â€œcould not \r\n  present the remainder of the documents demonstrating that the note and mortgage \r\n  had been paid in full, because her documents were lost after an agent for Ocwen \r\n  had secured her premises.â€Â  These assertions are meritless.\r\nThe documents Brown presented \r\n  showed payments which added up to substantially less than the amount of the \r\n  debt.Â  Brownâ€™s submission included a document evidencing a $6,000 payment which \r\n  occurred in 1987, approximately eight years before the execution of the note \r\n  and mortgage involved in the present action.Â  Brownâ€™s self-serving, conclusory \r\n  statement that she paid the note and mortgage in full was not supported by the \r\n  evidence.Â  Brownâ€™s evidence does not prove she paid the debt in full, but shows \r\n  Brown still has an arrearage.Â  Moreover, Brown had ample time after the discovery \r\n  requests seeking her evidence of payment and the subsequent order to compel \r\n  discovery to obtain duplicates of any lost documentation.\r\nThe master correctly found that Brown failed to meet her burden of proof â€œin \r\n  establishing any defense to the foreclosure action.â€\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the decision of the master-in-equity is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-472","title":"State v.

Wylie, Jr., Family Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 2004-UP-475\r\nHeard September 14, 2004 â€“ Filed \r\n  September 16, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nRobert N. Rosen, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nJohn Loy, of Summerville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; In this domestic relations \r\n  matter, Spencer Lockard (Husband) contends the family court erred in (1) failing \r\n  to award joint custody of the two children; (2) granting inadequate visitation \r\n  to Husband; and (3) awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to Linda Lockard (Wife).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusbandâ€™s marriage to Wife lasted about thirteen \r\n  years, during which time the couple produced two sons: Spencer Lee Lockard, \r\n  II, born April 15, 1990, and Bradford Parks Lockard, born July 6, 1993.Â  Throughout \r\n  the childrenâ€™s younger years, Wife stayed at home and acted as their primary \r\n  caretaker while Husband worked.Â  As the children grew, Husbandâ€™s lifelong anger \r\n  problems and belief in strict discipline began to undermine the partiesâ€™ marriage.Â  \r\n  Though the couple sought to repair their broken relationship through marriage \r\n  counseling, the effort ultimately proved fruitless.\r\nAs a consequence of the ongoing problems, Wife \r\n  filed for divorce on April 11, 2001, seeking custody of the partiesâ€™ two minor \r\n  children.Â  Husband filed an answer and counterclaim requesting sole custody \r\n  of the children, or in the alternative, joint custody.Â  Prior to a final hearing \r\n  on the merits, the family court entered a temporary order awarding Husband and \r\n  Wife joint physical custody of the children, with custody alternating every \r\n  two weeks in the marital home.\r\nDuring the final hearing before the family court, \r\n  testimony was presented as to several occasions when Husband lost control of \r\n  his anger, acting aggressively toward Wife and others.Â  Although Husband admitted \r\n  he had problems with his temper, he elicited testimony from other witnesses \r\n  to show the temporary joint custody arrangement had been a boon to the childrenâ€™s \r\n  maturation and well-being.Â  By final order and decree of divorce entered September \r\n  13, 2002, the family court awarded Wife custody of the children and granted \r\n  Husband â€œstandard visitationâ€ with restrictions.Â  The court also awarded Wife \r\n  $10,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Custody\r\nHusband contends the family court erred â€œby failing \r\n  to award the Husband and Wife 50/50 joint physical custodyâ€ of the children.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nOn appeal from the family court, this court has \r\n  jurisdiction to find the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence. Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 328, 526 S.E.2d 241, \r\n  244-45 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  This tribunal, however, is not required to disregard \r\n  the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 202, 522 \r\n  S.E.2d 835, 838 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Likewise, we are not obligated to ignore the \r\n  fact the family court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better \r\n  position to evaluate their testimony.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, \r\n  91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œBecause this court is not afforded \r\n  the opportunity for direct observation of the witnesses, we must accord great \r\n  deference to the trial courtâ€™s findings where matters of credibility are involved.â€Â  \r\n  Pountain v. Pountain, 332 S.C. 130, 135, 503 S.E.2d 757, 760-61 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1998).Â  â€œThis is especially true in cases involving the welfare and best \r\n  interests of children.â€Â  Id. at 135, 503 S.E.2d at 761.\r\nIn child custody controversies, the welfare and \r\n  best interests of the children are the primary, paramount, and controlling considerations \r\n  of the court.Â  Cook v. Cobb, 271 S.C. 136, 140, 245 S.E.2d 612, 614 (1978).Â  \r\n  The family court must consider the character, fitness, attitude, and inclinations \r\n  on the part of each parent as they impact the child.Â  Pountain, 332 S.C. \r\n  at 136, 503 S.E.2d at 760.Â  Moreover, in reaching a determination as to custody, \r\n  the family court should consider how the custody decision will impact all areas \r\n  of the childâ€™s life, including physical, psychological, spiritual, educational, \r\n  familial, emotional, and recreational aspects.Â  Kisling v. Allison, 343 \r\n  S.C. 674, 678-79, 541 S.E.2d 273, 275 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Indeed, in making custody \r\n  decisions, â€œthe totality of circumstances peculiar to each case constitutes \r\n  the only scale upon which the ultimate decision can be weighed.â€Â  Davenport \r\n  v. Davenport, 265 S.C. 524, 527, 220 S.E.2d 228, 230 (1975).\r\nIn view of the totality of the circumstances that \r\n  must be considered, we remain mindful that joint custody should only be ordered \r\n  under exceptional circumstances.Â  See Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. \r\n  118, 125, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003) (stating that â€œâ€˜divided custody is usually \r\n  harmful to and not conducive to the best interest and welfare of the childrenâ€™â€).Â  \r\n  Given our courtsâ€™ well-considered reluctance toward awarding joint custody, \r\n  we find the family court did not err in declining to award joint custody in \r\n  the case at bar.Â  Indeed, the family courtâ€™s decision finds ample support in \r\n  the record.Â  Husbandâ€™s frequent outbursts of anger and repeated efforts to minimize \r\n  Wifeâ€™s relationship with the children provide ample reasons for declining to \r\n  award such a heavily disfavored form of custody.\r\nII.Â  Visitation\r\nIn the alternative, Husband asserts the family \r\n  court erred in awarding Husband less than â€œstandardâ€ visitation.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen awarding visitation, the controlling \r\n  consideration is the welfare and best interest of the child.Â  Woodall v. \r\n  Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 12, 471 S.E.2d 154, 158 (1996).Â  As with child custody, \r\n  the issue of child visitation falls within the discretion of the trial judge, \r\n  and his findings will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  The original Final Order and Decree of Divorce issued by the family \r\n  court awarded Husband two weeks of summer visitation.Â  However, the Final Order \r\n  and Decree of Divorce was supplemented and amended in an order dated November \r\n  12, 2002, providing:\r\nVisitation shall be amended to include:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        a.&nbsp;\r\n         Two (2) additional weeks of summer visitation, \r\n  for a total of four (4) weeks summer visitation for the Father.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Weekday visitation during the off week for the Father.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Visitation on each childâ€™s birthday.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n        Telephone visitation for\r\n          either parent, without interference.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe record reveals nothing indicating the family \r\n  court strayed beyond its discretionary authority in awarding Husband four weeks \r\n  of summer visitation.\r\nIII.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nHusband maintains that, if he is successful on the \r\n  joint custody issue, he should not have to pay Wife $10,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\n  We affirmed the family courtâ€™s determination regarding custody.Â  Thus, Husband \r\n  did not prevail on the custody issue.Â  Alternatively, Husband asserts that the \r\n  family court abused its discretion in awarding Wife $10,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees will not be overturned \r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, \r\n  415, 368 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1988).Â  Before awarding attorneyâ€™s fees, the family \r\n  court should consider: (1) each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fee; (2) \r\n  the beneficial results obtained by the attorney; (3) the partiesâ€™ respective \r\n  financial conditions; and (4) the effect of the attorneyâ€™s fee on each partyâ€™s \r\n  standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d \r\n  812, 816 (1992); Heins v. Heins, 344 S.C. 146, 160, 543 S.E.2d 224, 231 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001).Â  In determining the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees to award, the \r\n  court should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the services \r\n  rendered; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) counselâ€™s professional \r\n  standing; (4) the contingency of compensation; (5) the beneficial results obtained; \r\n  and (6) the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, \r\n  304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991); Shirley v. Shirley, 342 \r\n  S.C. 324, 341, 536 S.E.2d 427, 436 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nHaving reviewed the award of attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  in light of the applicable factors, we find no abuse of discretion in the award.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the order of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and WILLIAMS, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\nÂ  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-476","title":"State v.

Church, of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\nHamilton Osborne, Jr. and James Y. Becker, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this banking dispute brought \r\n  by Respondent Wachovia Bank to collect on an outstanding note, Appellants Winona \r\n  Grain Company and Michael Brittonâ€”the noteâ€™s borrower and guarantor, respectivelyâ€”challenge \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of their counterclaim against Wachovia.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nIn late 1997, Michael Britton, the principal manager \r\n  of Winona Grain Company, a corporation in the business of buying and selling \r\n  grain, met with Darren Bouknight, a loan officer for Wachovia Bank, to acquire \r\n  capital for operating the business.Â  Through Bouknight, the bank agreed to extend \r\n  two lines of credit to Winona, one in the amount of $750,000.00 and the other \r\n  in the amount of $75,000.00.Â  \r\nWachovia secured the larger line of credit through \r\n  a first priority lien on Winonaâ€™s South Carolina Department of Agriculture warehouse \r\n  grain receipts and capped the amount of credit available to 80% of the value \r\n  of the receipts.Â  To maintain this 80% margin, the loanâ€™s commitment letter \r\n  allowed Wachovia to demand partial repayment anytime grain devaluation caused \r\n  the balance owed on the loan to exceed 80% of the value of the grain receipts.Â  \r\n  If Wachovia made such a demand, the commitment letter gave Winona five business \r\n  days to bring the amounts back within the 80% margin requirement.Â  Though the \r\n  smaller line of credit had no corresponding margin requirement, Wachovia secured \r\n  the smaller loan through a â€œ[c]ontinuing first security interest in all non-receipted \r\n  grain inventory, inventory, accounts receivable, and assignment of grain trading \r\n  Margin Account.â€Â  \r\nThe commitment letters for both loans contained \r\n  cross-default clauses and established April 30, 1999 as the date when the lines \r\n  of credit expired.Â  The commitment letters also contained the following terms:\r\n\r\nPrepayment: \r\nBoth Notes â€“ At your companyâ€™s election, your company \r\n  may prepay these Loans in whole or part without penalty.\r\n. . . .\r\nDisbursement and Conditions:\r\nBoth Notes â€“ Funds are to be distributed to Winona Grain \r\n  Co. Inc.â€™s business checking account at Wachovia Bank, N.A.\r\n. . . . \r\nThe provisions of the commitment shall survive the Loan closing \r\n  and shall be incorporated in the Loan documents so that a default by the Borrower \r\n  of any such provision shall constitute a default under the Loan documents.\r\n\r\nMore than a week after agreeing to the terms of \r\n  the commitment letters, Winona executed a Note and Security Agreement for both \r\n  revolving lines of credit using the bankâ€™s standard forms.Â  Both notes specifically \r\n  incorporated the terms and conditions contained in the commitment letters and \r\n  indicated the loans were due on demand.Â  The notes also included the following \r\n  provision:\r\n\r\nIn addition, to the extent not prohibited by law, the Borrower \r\n  hereby grants to the Lender a security interest in and security title to, and \r\n  does hereby assign, pledge, transfer and convey to Lender . . . any balance \r\n  or deposit accounts of the Borrower, whether such accounts be general or special, \r\n  or individual or multiple party, and upon all drafts, notes, or other items \r\n  deposited for collection or presented for payment by the Borrower with the Lender, \r\n  and the Lender may at any time, without demand or notice, appropriate and apply \r\n  any of such to the payment of any of the Obligations (except for Restricted \r\n  Debt), whether or not due.\r\n\r\nIn the months following execution of the \r\n  notes, Wachovia dispersed the requested funds from both lines of credit into \r\n  Winonaâ€™s business checking account.Â  At some time in August, Bouknight telephoned \r\n  Britton to tell him to deposit funds into Winonaâ€™s account to cover checks that \r\n  had been presented for payment against the account that day.Â  Though Britton \r\n  responded by making a deposit into Winonaâ€™s checking account, the deposit came \r\n  in the form of an out-of-state check and was thus subject to Wachoviaâ€™s five-day \r\n  hold policy for out-of-state checks.Â  As a consequence, the checks that prompted \r\n  Bouknightâ€™s telephone call were returned for insufficient funds.Â  \r\nIn October of 1998, because Winona had \r\n  not given the South Carolina Department of Agriculture their audited financial \r\n  statements, the Department withheld validation of Winonaâ€™s warehouse receipts.Â  \r\n  Although Winonaâ€™s receipts lacked Department validation, Bouknight agreed to \r\n  advance funds to Winona on the grain under the trust receipts.Â  Thus, while \r\n  Winona collected the financial records required for Department validation, Wachovia \r\n  made advancements of $40,000.00, $15,000.00, $75,000.00, and $8,000.00, with \r\n  respective due dates of October 29, October 31, November 2, and November 5, \r\n  1998.Â  \r\nOn November 3, 1998, after the expiration \r\n  dates for the first three trust receipts passed with no repayment from Winona, \r\n  Wachovia applied $16,684.10 of Winonaâ€™s checking account against the larger \r\n  line of credit.Â  Again on November 4, Wachovia applied an additional $21,042.06 \r\n  of Winonaâ€™s account against the larger line of credit.Â  Over the same two days, \r\n  Wachovia returned 12 checks on Winonaâ€™s account unpaid.Â  \r\nOn November 12, 1998, the Department of Agriculture \r\n  validated Winonaâ€™s warehouse receipts, thereby providing adequate security for \r\n  the larger line of credit.Â  Shortly thereafter, with the loan no longer under-collateralized, \r\n  Wachovia made advancements of $145,000.00 and $300,000.00 on the larger line \r\n  of credit, though Wachovia applied $45,000.00 of the advanced funds against \r\n  the outstanding amount on the smaller line of credit.Â  \r\nOver the next two months, Wachovia returned 19 checks on \r\n  Winonaâ€™s account for insufficient funds.Â  Thereafter, Wachovia brought this \r\n  action against Winona for claim and delivery and recovery on the notes.Â  Wachovia \r\n  also sought to recover against Britton on his personal guarantee.Â  Winona asserted \r\n  setoff as a defense and counterclaimed for wrongful dishonor of checks presented \r\n  for payment against Winonaâ€™s checking account.Â  \r\nPrior to the trial on the merits, the trial court \r\n  granted Wachoviaâ€™s motion for summary judgment on its claims against Winona \r\n  and Britton for the balance due on the notes in the amount of $54,916.75.Â  With \r\n  only Winonaâ€™s counterclaims remaining, a trial was commenced before a jury on \r\n  November 18, 2002.Â  After Winona presented its evidence, Wachovia moved for \r\n  directed verdict.Â  After hearing argument, the trial court granted Wachoviaâ€™s \r\n  directed verdict motion as to all causes of action.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nMotions for directed verdict require the trial \r\n  judge to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  \r\n  This court will reverse the trial court only when there is no evidence to support \r\n  the ruling below. Steinke v. South Carolina Dept. of Labor, Licensing and \r\n  Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 520 S.E.2d 142 (1999).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wrongful Dishonor\r\n\r\nWinona contends the trial court erred in directing \r\n  a verdict against its counterclaim for wrongful dishonor because the loan agreement \r\n  with Wachovia was ambiguous and unconscionable.Â  We disagree.\r\nA bank owes a general duty to each customer to \r\n  honor checks drawn on his or her account if the customerâ€™s account has sufficient \r\n  funds to cover the item presented.Â  St. Charles Mercantile Co. v. Armour \r\n  &amp; Co., 156 S.C. 397, 405, 153 S.E. 473, 477 (1930) (â€œIt was the duty \r\n  of the bank, when a check which properly demanded payment was presented, to \r\n  make payment, if the drawer had sufficient funds to meet it.â€).Â  Rather than \r\n  contending the companyâ€™s checking account had sufficient funds to cover each \r\n  of the dishonored checks, Winona argues that the accountâ€™s reoccurring insufficiencies \r\n  were due to Wachoviaâ€™s improper conduct, not its own.Â  \r\nSpecifically, Winona argues Wachovia was required \r\n  to immediately credit Winonaâ€™s account for all deposits, and when Wachovia placed \r\n  a five-day hold on the deposit of an out-of-state check for $80,000.00, Wachovia \r\n  wrongfully caused an insufficiency that resulted in two checks being returned \r\n  on August 10, 1998.Â  To support their position that Wachovia was bound to give \r\n  immediate credit for all depositsâ€”a requirement not found in the loan documentsâ€”Winona \r\n  contends that because Wachovia had previously given Winona immediate credit \r\n  on deposits, they established a course of dealing that Wachovia was bound to \r\n  continue.Â  This argument finds no support in our law.Â  Courts do not look to \r\n  the course of dealing between parties as a tool for inserting new obligations \r\n  among those made explicit by the terms of a written agreement.Â  Rather, courts \r\n  draw upon partiesâ€™ dealings only when necessary to acquire an improved understand \r\n  of the meaning the parties intended by using particular words or expressions \r\n  in a subsequent written agreement.Â  Thus, course of dealing evidence is used \r\n  to aid to contract interpretation, not to show contract augmentation.Â  See \r\n  Columbia Nitrogen Corp. v. Royster Co., 451 F.2d 3, 9 (4th Cir. 1971) \r\n  (â€œ[E]vidence of usage of trade and course of dealing should be excluded whenever \r\n  it cannot be reasonably construed as consistent with the terms of the contract.â€); \r\n  Wolfe v. Herlihy, 218 S.C. 90, 95, 61 S.E.2d 764, 767-68 (1950) (â€œThe \r\n  testimony shows that this payment was tendered in full conformity with the construction \r\n  placed upon the ambiguous provisions of the lease by the parties themselves \r\n  through their long course of dealing.â€).Â  \r\nAmbiguities or conflicts in documents constituting \r\n  contract must be construed against the party who prepared the contract. Mid-Continent \r\n  Refrigerator Co. v. Way, 263 S.C. 101, 208 S.E.2d 31 (1974); Southern \r\n  Atlantic Financial Services, Inc. v. Middleton, 349 S.C. 77, 562 S.E.2d \r\n  482 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Identical repayment provisions of both commitment letters \r\n  state, â€œ[b]orrower shall repay all or any part of the amount committed on such \r\n  dates as it may determineâ€¦â€ Winona asserts these provisions, coupled with the \r\n  ability to prepay without penalty, conflict with Wachoviaâ€™s right under the \r\n  notes to require payment at any time.Â  These two provisions, however, merely \r\n  allow either party to elect at any time to extinguish the debt.Â  No ambiguity \r\n  results from these terms.Â Â Â  \r\nWinona also argues that \r\n  the court should give more weight to the typed commitment letters than to the \r\n  printed notes.Â  This rule, however, only applies when the documents create an \r\n  inconsistency and because the trial judge correctly found no ambiguity in the \r\n  documents, this argument is without merit.Â  See 17A Am. Jur. 2d Contracts \r\n  Â§ 395 (2002).\r\nAs such, even though Wachovia had immediately credited \r\n  previous deposits, both partiesâ€™ responsibilities and obligations remained the \r\n  same as outlined in their written agreement. \r\nWinona next argues Wachovia was required to make \r\n  automatic advances from the lines of credit to cover overdrafts on the Winona \r\n  account.Â  If Wachovia had made such automatic advances, Winona argues, the balance \r\n  in the checking account would have been sufficient to cover certain checks Wachovia \r\n  dishonored.Â  Although no written agreement between Wachovia and Winona mentions \r\n  automatic overdraft coverage, Winona relys exclusively on Brittonâ€™s own testimony \r\n  about an alleged oral agreement made with Bouknight.Â  Winonaâ€™s reliance is misplaced. \r\n  Â The parol evidence rule bars the introduction of extrinsic evidence to modify \r\n  or contradict the terms of an integrated written agreement.Â  Levy v. Outdoor \r\n  Resorts, 304 S.C. 427, 432, 405 S.E.2d 387, 390 (1991).Â  As a matter of \r\n  substantive law, therefore, Brittonâ€™s testimony cannot modify the explicit terms \r\n  of the partiesâ€™ written agreement.\r\nWinona further argues that Wachovia wrongfully \r\n  dishonored two $30,000.00 checks that Winona drew on its account at Wachovia \r\n  Bank and then deposited into Winonaâ€™s account at Pee Dee Federal Savings Bank.Â  \r\n  Winona contends that although Wachovia later tendered a cashierâ€™s check to satisfy \r\n  the dishonored checks, the subsequent tender did not retroactively ameliorate \r\n  the accountâ€™s previous insufficiency.Â  \r\nAs the forgoing makes clear, Winona has adduced \r\n  no evidence to show it had sufficient funds in its account to satisfy the checks \r\n  dishonored by Wachovia.Â  Further, Winonaâ€™s allegations of wrongdoing by Wachovia \r\n  all fail as a matter of law.Â  Accordingly, the trial court committed no error \r\n  in granting Wachoviaâ€™s directed verdict motion on Winonaâ€™s counterclaims.Â  \r\n\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Setoff\r\n\r\nAs its final issue on appeal, Winona argues \r\n  the trial court erred in granting Wachoviaâ€™s motion for summary judgment because \r\n  the defense of setoff asserted by Winona created factual issues as to the amount \r\n  of indebtedness owed under the notes.Â  We disagree.\r\nRather than contesting facts germane to Wachoviaâ€™s \r\n  claim, Winona, in effect, asserts that the mere existence of its counterclaim \r\n  allows for the possibility of a right of setoff, thereby precluding the trial \r\n  court from granting summary judgment.Â  As the trial court correctly noted, â€œthe \r\n  mere existence of this potential right of setoff does not create a genuine issue \r\n  of material fact.â€Â  With no genuine dispute as to the material facts of Wachoviaâ€™s \r\n  claim, the trial court committed no error in granting summary judgment. \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-483","title":"State v.

[1] \r\n  \r\nFACTS\r\n  Don Cauthen hired Spivey to manage Studebakerâ€™s, a club owned by \r\n    Cauthen.Â  One of Spiveyâ€™s responsibilities was to verify the nightly receipts. \r\n    After closing, the bartenders added the receipts in their cash register, prepared \r\n    a deposit slip, and turned it into the manager on duty that night.Â  The manager \r\n    then verified the deposit slip and compared it to the register tape, which \r\n    the bartenders did not have access to prior to calculating their deposit slips.Â  \r\n    The manager then took the deposit by the bank that night, and Diane Davenport, \r\n    the barâ€™s bookkeeper, collected the statements the following morning.\r\n  Davenport testified that on one occasion in September 1994, she \r\n    collected the deposits and statement from the bank and noticed several deposit \r\n    slips written by bartenders that were not processed by the bank.Â  She compared \r\n    the slips and found slips that Spivey had written for a lesser amount, which \r\n    were processed by the bank.Â  The currency amount on the slip written by Spivey \r\n    was $150 less than the amount listed by the bartender.\r\n  Cauthen testified that he became suspicious of Spivey and gave Richard Zecchino, \r\n    a bartender at Studebakerâ€™s, a $100 bill to place in one of the registers \r\n    on a night Spivey was working as a manager to determine if Spivey was decreasing \r\n    the amount on the deposit slips.Â  At the end of the night, the register should \r\n    have been $100 over the appropriate amount.Â  The deposit slip for that night \r\n    was reduced by $100.Â  Cauthen testified he confronted Spivey regarding the \r\n    changed deposit slips and Spivey maintained he changed them because of having \r\n    to move money between registers.Â  Cauthen, however, testified that none of \r\n    the deposit slips had been increased; only decreased.\r\n  Cauthen also testified about the procedures employed in handling the money.Â  \r\n    He testified that the bartender counted the money, which was then verified \r\n    by the manager according to the register tape.Â  If the amount was counted \r\n    incorrectly or was otherwise different from the tape, the bartender was notified \r\n    and was the only one permitted to make any changes.Â  Cauthen testified the \r\n    manager then took the money to the bank and made the night deposit.Â  \r\n  State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) forensic examiner Joyce Lauterbach \r\n    reviewed the deposit slips from January through September 1994 and determined \r\n    there were 180 altered slips.Â  Using a video spectral comparator, she determined \r\n    the majority of the slips contained overwriting or changes from $100 to $300.Â  \r\n    The total of the changes was found to be $17,730.Â  It was later determined \r\n    that Spivey was the manager on duty for all but one instance of a changed \r\n    deposit slip.\r\n  Zecchino testified he counted the money in his register several times before \r\n    giving the money to the manager on duty.Â  He testified that if his calculations \r\n    were incorrect, he requested a new deposit slip and did not make any changes \r\n    to the one he had already written.Â  He also testified that several of his \r\n    deposit slips that were altered by $100 to $200 were not calculation errors \r\n    or mistakes.Â  Additionally, he testified the bartenders frequently did not \r\n    ring up drinks so the register had more money in it than the tape showed, \r\n    creating a buffer.Â  Finally, Zecchino testified that after he was placed in \r\n    charge of decreasing pour costs and making certain all drinks were accounted \r\n    for on the registers, Spivey told him to â€œlay off of them a little bit.â€\r\n  At trial, Spivey moved for a directed verdict on the grounds that when viewing \r\n    all evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the State failed to \r\n    produce any evidence that he had taken any property.Â  The trial court denied \r\n    the motion.Â  Spivey renewed the motion at the end of trial, and the court \r\n    denied the motion again.\r\n  Spivey was convicted of breach of trust with fraudulent intent and sentenced \r\n    to eight years, suspended on time served with five years probation.Â  The court \r\n    also ordered him to pay $13,000 in restitution.\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nSpivey argues the\r\ntrial court erred in failing to grant his motion for a directed verdict on the\r\ncharge of breach of trust with fraudulent intent.&nbsp;\r\nHe maintains the State failed to produce any direct or circumstantial\r\nevidence to show he actually took money as opposed to simply correcting the\r\ndeposit slips.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the denial of a motion for a directed verdict, we must use \r\n      the same standard as the trial court and view the evidence in the light \r\n      most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Harris, 351 S.C. 643, 653, \r\n      572 S.E.2d 267, 273 (2002).Â  The trial court is concerned with the existence \r\n      of evidence, not its weight.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 555, \r\n      564 S.E.2d 87, 92 (2002).Â  The trial judge is required to submit the case \r\n      to the jury if there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial \r\n      evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused.Â  State \r\n      v. Lollis, 343 S.C. 580, 584, 541 S.E.2d 254, 256 (2001).Â  On the other \r\n      hand, â€œ[a] defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails \r\n      to produce any direct or substantial circumstantial evidence of the offense \r\n      charged.â€Â  State v. Rothschild, 351 S.C. 238, 243, 569 S.E.2d 346, \r\n      348 (2002).Â \r\n    Breach of trust with fraudulent intent, commonly called embezzlement in \r\n      other jurisdictions, has been defined as â€œlarceny after trust, which includes \r\n      all of the elements of larceny or in common parlance, stealing, except the \r\n      unlawful taking in the beginning.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-230 (Supp. 2003); \r\n      State v. Owings, 205 S.C. 314, 316, 31 S.E.2d 906, 907 (1944).Â  â€œThe \r\n      primary difference between larceny and breach of trust is that in â€˜common-law \r\n      larceny, possession of the property stolen is obtained unlawfully, while \r\n      in breach of trust, the possession is obtained lawfully.â€™â€Â  State v. \r\n      Scott, 330 S.C. 125, 130, 497 S.E.2d 735, 738 (Ct. App. 1998) (quoting \r\n      State v. McCann, 167 S.C. 393, 398, 166 S.E. 411, 413 (1932)).Â  Thus, \r\n      in order to prove breach of trust, the State had to prove Spivey actually \r\n      took money from the deposits and the appropriation was accompanied by a \r\n      fraudulent intent to destroy the right of the true owner, Studebakerâ€™s.\r\n    At trial, several bartenders testified regarding their deposits.Â  \r\n      Most notably, Zecchino testified he rarely miscounted his money and was \r\n      certain the amount written on his deposit slip was the same amount he gave \r\n      to Spivey.Â  Zecchino also testified that on specific dates he did not recall \r\n      being told that his count was off.Â  Finally, he testified that if he erred \r\n      in his calculations, he was supposed to get a new deposit slip and make \r\n      the change, not Spivey.\r\n    Cauthen testified he had Zecchino put an extra one hundred dollar \r\n      bill in one of the registers without Spiveyâ€™s knowledge.Â  After the money \r\n      was counted and turned over to Spivey, the deposit slip was reduced by $100.Â  \r\n      Cauthen also testified that it was Spiveyâ€™s duty to make the night deposits.Â  \r\n      Finally, Davenport testified it was Spiveyâ€™s handwriting on the altered \r\n      deposit slips and the forensic examiner verified that there were approximately \r\n      180 altered slips from January through September of 1994.\r\n    The State, therefore, presented substantial \r\n      circumstantial evidence that Spivey was improperly reducing the amount on \r\n      the deposit slips and the money in Spiveyâ€™s possession that should have \r\n      been included in the deposit for Studebakerâ€™s was not deposited in the bank.Â  \r\n      Accordingly, we find the State offered substantial circumstantial evidence \r\n      of Spiveyâ€™s taking of money that belonged to Studebakerâ€™s and thus, the \r\n      trial court properly denied Spiveyâ€™s motion for a directed verdict.\r\n    AFFIRMED.\r\n    STILWELL, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-484","title":"State v.

Savitz, III, of Columbia, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, \r\n  all of Columbia; and Solicitor Robert M. Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  Ernest Sibert appeals his \r\n  guilty pleas and an order terminating his participation in drug court, arguing \r\n  his pleas were involuntary and the trial court erred by terminating him from \r\n  drug court.Â  We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nOn February 19, 2001, Sibert pled guilty to 2nd degree \r\n  burglary; distribution of crack, 3rd offense; and possession of crack, \r\n  3rd offense.Â  Sibert was sentenced to 15 years for burglary and distribution \r\n  of crack, and 10 years for possession of crack, all suspended upon his entry \r\n  into and completion of the drug court program.Â  \r\nSibert entered into the drug court program on February \r\n  19, 2001.Â  On May 16, 2002, the State sought to have Sibertâ€™s drug court participation \r\n  terminated for violating numerous conditions of drug court: in April 2001 he \r\n  made a change in annual employment and was sanctioned to visit an alcohol recovery \r\n  center; in September 2001 he failed to pay his fees and was sanctioned to 8 \r\n  hours of community service; in October 2001 he twice failed to pay his fees \r\n  again and was sanctioned with community service and weekend duty in the detention \r\n  center; and in December 2001 he quit his job and was sanctioned to 16 hours \r\n  of community service. Additionally, while enrolled in drug court, Sibert was \r\n  indicted for 1st degree burglary, assault and battery of a high and aggravated \r\n  nature, and possession of heroin.Â  Furthermore, Sibert was served with two warrants \r\n  for trafficking while he was incarcerated.\r\nIn his defense, Sibert claimed he only missed one \r\n  of his appointments; he had not failed any of his drug tests while he was enrolled \r\n  in drug court; and he could not pay his weekly fees because he was only getting \r\n  paid every two weeks.Â  \r\nDuring the May 16, 2002 termination hearing, Sibert \r\n  pleaded guilty to 2nd degree burglary; assault and battery of a high and aggravated \r\n  nature; possession of heroin; possession with intent to distribute within a \r\n  half mile of a school; possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, 3rd \r\n  offense; distribution of crack, 3rd offense; and distribution \r\n  of crack within a half mile of a park.Â  \r\nThe trial court terminated Sibertâ€™s participation in \r\n  drug court and sentenced Sibert to concurrent sentences of 10 years on all charges \r\n  with the exception of 15 years for distribution of crack, 3rd offense, and 5 \r\n  years for possession of heroin.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Sibert argues the trial court erred in terminating \r\n  his participation in drug court.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe nature of the inquiry and extent of the investigation \r\n  to be conducted by the [trial court] in determining whether the condition of \r\n  a suspended sentence has been violated are matters that rest in the sound discretion \r\n  of that court.â€Â  State v. Miller, 122 S.C. 468, 474-475, 115 S.E. 742, \r\n  745 (1923) (citation omitted).Â  â€œ[T]he authority of the [trial court] to revoke \r\n  such suspension of sentence may not be capriciously or arbitrarily exercised, \r\n  but should always be predicated upon an evidentiary showing of fact tending \r\n  to establish violation of the conditions.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nOur scope of review is confined to the correction \r\n  of errors of law, unless it appears the trial court was influenced or controlled \r\n  by some erroneous view of the law, was wholly without evidence to support it, \r\n  or amounted to a manifest abuse of discretion.Â  Id.Â  Otherwise, a finding \r\n  of fact by the trial court as to a breach of the conditions of a suspended sentence \r\n  is final.Â  Id.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe State presented evidence that Sibert missed \r\n  a case management appointment, was repeatedly late paying his required fees, \r\n  failed to remain employed, and was rearrested on multiple charges, including \r\n  possession of heroin.Â  Additionally, while Sibert was incarcerated for these \r\n  crimes, he was served warrants for drug trafficking.Â  Because there was sufficient \r\n  evidence for the trial court to determine that Sibert violated the conditions \r\n  of drug court, the court did not abuse its discretion in terminating Sibertâ€™s \r\n  participation in drug court.Â Â Â  \r\nII.Â  Sibert contends his guilty pleas did not comply \r\n  with the standards set forth in Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238 (1969); \r\n  however, Sibert did not object to the circuit courtâ€™s accepting his guilty plea, \r\n  nor did he assert that his plea was involuntarily or unknowingly given.Â  Thus, \r\n  the issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  Holy Loch Distribs., Inc. \r\n  v. Hitchcock, 340 S.C. 20, 24, 531 S.E.2d 282, 284 (2000) (â€œIn order to \r\n  preserve an issue for appellate review, the issue must have been raised to and \r\n  ruled upon by the trial court.â€). \r\nIII.Â  Sibert also claims that two of his pleas \r\n  should be vacated because he did not exercise a written waiver of presentment \r\n  to the grand jury.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œBy their plain language, [South Carolina Code sections \r\n  17-23-130 and 140 (2003)] make a written waiver of presentment of indictments \r\n  not presented to a grand jury mandatory before the trial judge can accept the \r\n  plea. We therefore hold appellantâ€™s failure to properly execute the waivers \r\n  renders the pleas invalid.â€Â  Summerall v. State, 278 S.C. 255, 256, 294 \r\n  S.E.2d 344, 344 (1982).\r\nThus, the pleas on the two indictments not presented \r\n  to the grand jury, 2002-GS-23-2852 and 2853, are vacated and the case is remanded \r\n  for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.Â  The pleas on the remaining \r\n  indictment numbers are affirmed.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nSTILWELL, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-485","title":"State v.

California, 386 \r\n  U.S. 738 (1967), Rayfieldâ€™s appellate counsel filed an appeal and a petition \r\n  to be relieved as counsel, arguing in the Anders brief that the trial \r\n  court erred in consolidating the charges.Â  This court denied counselâ€™s petition \r\n  to be relieved and ordered the parties to brief the issue of whether, in light \r\n  of this courtâ€™s decision in State v. Chisolm, 355 S.C. 175, 584 S.E.2d \r\n  401 (Ct.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald \r\n  J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General Melody J. Brown, all of Columbia; and \r\n  Solicitor Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n&nbsp; \r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Chase Randlyn Burnett appeals \r\n  her transfer from family court to circuit court and her conviction for murder.Â  \r\n  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nOn September 21, 1998, Jonathan Burnett found his \r\n  mother, Robin Burnett, dead in her bedroom.Â  Police officers discovered Robin \r\n  had a single gunshot wound to the head and a gun in her hand, giving the initial \r\n  appearance of suicide.Â  Officers also determined Robin had most likely died \r\n  on the night of September 20.Â  Almost immediately, officers were concerned with \r\n  the odd position of the gun in Robinâ€™s hand and focused their investigation \r\n  on Chase Burnett, Robinâ€™s fifteen-year-old daughter.Â  \r\nAlan Wood and Tim Tucker, of the Spartanburg sheriffâ€™s \r\n  department, questioned Chase.Â  After waiving her rights, Chase made two statements \r\n  to the police.Â  In her first statement, she denied any knowledge of her motherâ€™s \r\n  death and stated she spent the day of September 21 with her friends.Â  However, \r\n  in her second statement, made approximately one and a half hours after the first, \r\n  she recalled a nightmare where her mother pointed a gun at her father and herself.Â  \r\n  Chase stated she then woke up in her motherâ€™s room, retrieved a gun from under \r\n  the bed, and pulled the trigger.Â  \r\nChase was charged with murdering her mother in \r\n  a juvenile proceeding in the family court; however, the family court transferred \r\n  jurisdiction to the circuit court, where Chase was tried and convicted of murder.Â  \r\n  The circuit court sentenced Chase to forty years.Â  The court noted credible \r\n  evidence of a history of criminal domestic violence pursuant to Section 16-25-90 \r\n  of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2003), which makes Chase eligible for parole \r\n  after serving one-fourth of her sentence.Â  Chase appeals her transfer to circuit \r\n  court and her conviction for murder.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  â€œThe appellate court will affirm a transfer order \r\n    unless the family court has abused its discretion.â€Â  State v. Avery,&nbsp;333 \r\n    S.C. 284, 292, 509 S.E.2d 476, 481&nbsp;(1998).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs \r\n    when the conclusions of the trial court either lack evidentiary support or \r\n    are controlled by an error of law.Â  State v. Wise, 359 S.C. 14, 21, \r\n    596 S.E.2d 475, 478&nbsp;(2004).\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  Chase appeals her \r\n    conviction on the grounds that the family court judgeâ€™s transfer order was \r\n    conclusory and without a sufficient factual basis.Â  We disagree.\r\n  Section 20-7-7605(5) of the South Carolina Code \r\n    (Supp. 2003) allows transfer of jurisdiction over minors ages fourteen and \r\n    fifteen charged with a serious felony, if after full investigation and a hearing, \r\n    the family court determines it is contrary to the interest of the child or \r\n    public to retain jurisdiction.Â  In Kent v. United States, 383 U.S. \r\n    541 (1966), the United States Supreme Court enunciated eight factors for the \r\n    family court to consider when transferring a juvenile from family court to \r\n    circuit court.Â  In a recent case, our supreme court reiterated those factors:\r\n\r\n  1.Â  The seriousness of the alleged offense to the community \r\n    and whether the protection of the community requires waiver.Â  \r\n  2.Â  Whether the alleged offense was committed in an aggressive, \r\n    violent, premeditated, or willful manner.Â  \r\n  3.Â  Whether the alleged offense was against persons or against \r\n    property, greater weight being given to offenses against persons especially \r\n    if injury resulted.Â  \r\n  4.Â  The prosecutive merit of the complaint, i.e., whether \r\n    there is evidence upon which a Grand Jury may be expected to return an indictmentâ€¦.Â  \r\n  \r\n  5.Â  The desirability of trial and disposition of the entire \r\n    offense in one court when the juvenile's associates in the alleged offense \r\n    are adults who will be charged with a crimeâ€¦.Â  \r\n  6.Â  The sophistication and maturity of the juvenile as determined \r\n    by consideration of his home, environmental situation, emotional attitude \r\n    and pattern of living.Â  \r\n  7.Â  The record and previous [criminal or adjudicative] history \r\n    of the juvenileâ€¦.Â  \r\n  8.Â  The prospects for adequate protection of the public and \r\n    the likelihood of reasonable rehabilitation of the juvenile (if he is found \r\n    to have committed the alleged offense) by the use of procedures, services \r\n    and facilities currently available to the Juvenile Court.\r\n\r\n  State v. Corey D., 339 S.C. 107, 117 n.4, \r\n    529 S.E.2d 20, 26&nbsp;n.4 (2000) (quoting Kent, 383 U.S. at 566-67). \r\n  \r\n  The family court \r\n    order that transferred jurisdiction over Chase to the circuit court contained \r\n    findings of facts regarding all of the Kent factors.Â  Chase argues \r\n    some of these findings were not supported by evidence and the courtâ€™s findings \r\n    were conclusory.&nbsp; \r\n  Chase specifically addresses the eighth \r\n    Kent factor, and claims the family courtâ€™s finding that â€œa prospect \r\n    of rehabilitation within the juvenile system is not goodâ€ is unsupported by \r\n    the record.Â  However, this finding of fact does have evidentiary support.Â  \r\n    While Chaseâ€™s mental health diagnosis was in dispute, there was a consensus \r\n    that she had serious mental health problems. \r\n    [2] Â  The issue represented by the eighth Kent factor is whether \r\n    a family court sentence would offer sufficient time in the Department of Juvenile \r\n    Justice for Chase to be rehabilitated.Â  See Sanders v. State, \r\n    281 S.C. 53, 56, 314 S.E.2d 319, 321&nbsp;(1984) (stating the serious nature \r\n    of the offense is a major factor in the transfer decision, especially where \r\n    a family court sentence cannot extend past the twenty-first birthday, whereas \r\n    the circuit court can impose an adult term sentence).\r\n  Several expert witnesses testified \r\n    at the transfer hearing.Â  Two psychiatrists and a psychologist testified for \r\n    the defense and thought it would be appropriate for the Department of Juvenile \r\n    Justice to rehabilitate Chase, yet none could guarantee rehabilitation under \r\n    the maximum juvenile detention time frame.Â  The Department of Juvenile Justice \r\n    psychiatrist also could not determine with a reasonable degree of medical \r\n    certainty whether his department could rehabilitate Chase within the time \r\n    frame.Â  The evidence of rehabilitation was inconclusive at best.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, evidence indicated \r\n    that the prospect of rehabilitation prior to Chaseâ€™s twenty-first birthday \r\n    or confinement release date was unlikely.Â  Chase had ten infractions in the \r\n    Department of Juvenile Justice that showed â€œoppositional behavior.â€Â  This \r\n    resistance to authority was also demonstrated by Chaseâ€™s decision to quit \r\n    taking medication despite the treating physicianâ€™s advice to the contrary.Â  \r\n    Evidence concerning Chaseâ€™s resistance to authority undermines her ability \r\n    to be rehabilitated within the short time period that a family court sentence \r\n    would provide and supports the family courtâ€™s decision to transfer jurisdiction \r\n    to the circuit court.Â  \r\n  Additionally, Chase argues \r\n    the transfer order was conclusory and it was the responsibility of the family \r\n    court to include a sufficient statement of reasons for, and considerations \r\n    leading to, its decision.Â  See In re Sullivan, 274 S.C. 544, \r\n    548, 265 S.E.2d 527, 529 (1980).Â  The family courtâ€™s transfer order, however, \r\n    when paired with the extensive hearing transcript, shows Chase is not deprived \r\n    of this courtâ€™s meaningful review of the decision.Â  Id. 274 S.C. at \r\n    547-48, 265 S.E.2d at 529.Â  Instead, the entire record demonstrates the family \r\n    court devoted substantial time and consideration to this issue.Â  In light \r\n    of evidence supporting the family courtâ€™s decision, we find no error in the \r\n    family courtâ€™s order.\r\n  AFFIRMED.\r\n  STILWELL, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  A defense expert diagnosed Chase as suffering from post-traumatic \r\n    stress disorder and secondary depression whereas the state psychiatrist diagnosed \r\n    her with depression, features of borderline personality disorder, and adjustment \r\n    and anxiety disorders.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-488","title":"State v.

Hicks Harwell, Jr., Circuit Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No.Â  2004-UP-489\r\nSubmitted September 15, 2004 â€“ Filed September 21, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nEdward L. Graham, of Florence, for Appellant.\r\nE. Lloyd Willcox, II, of Florence, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this action to enforce the \r\n  judgment of an Alabama court, the appellant challenges the trial courtâ€™s determination \r\n  regarding personal jurisdiction and the validity of service of process.Â  We \r\n  affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nFollowing an investigation by the Environmental \r\n  Protection Agency into the illegal dumping of hazardous substances at a smelting \r\n  and battery recycling facility located in Leeds, Alabama, Exide Corporation \r\n  and Johnson Controls, Inc. (â€œRespondentsâ€), along with others, entered into \r\n  a consent decree with the United States government.Â  The consent decree obligated \r\n  the signatories to finance and perform cleanup at the site and also to reimburse \r\n  the United States for past and future costs associated with cleanup.Â  As provided \r\n  for by federal law, Respondents sought contribution from more than one hundred \r\n  entities also identified as potentially liable for the contamination at the \r\n  Leeds facility.Â  Among those identified by Respondents was Bushâ€™s Recycling \r\n  (â€œAppellantâ€), a corporation with its principal place of business in Florence, \r\n  South Carolina.\r\nRespondents brought suit in the United \r\n  States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, Southern Division, \r\n  against Appellant and all others from whom contribution was sought.Â  To initiate \r\n  the contribution proceedings, Respondents mailed Appellant a request to sign \r\n  a waiver of service notification.Â  Though Appellantâ€™s president, George Bush, \r\n  read the request, he declined to waive service.Â  Respondents then hired a professional \r\n  process server, Charles Ward, to effectuate formal service.Â  Ward personally \r\n  served the Summons and Complaint on an employee named Areece Myers on August \r\n  27, 1999 in Florence, South Carolina.Â  \r\n When Appellant failed to answer or otherwise \r\n  defend against the Complaint, Respondents moved for default judgment pursuant \r\n  to Rule 55(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  On November 19, 1999, \r\n  the federal court granted the motion, issuing a default judgment against Appellant \r\n  in the amount of $80,696.\r\nSeeking to enforce the Alabama judgment against \r\n  Appellant, Respondents filed a Notice of Foreign Judgment in the Florence County \r\n  Court of Common Pleas on August 2, 2001, and served the same on Appellant seven \r\n  days later.Â  In response, Appellant filed a Notice of Defenses, contending that \r\n  service of process was ineffectual and the federal court in Alabama lacked personal \r\n  jurisdiction over Appellant.Â  In addition, Appellant asserted defenses on the \r\n  merits, requested relief from the judgment on account of â€œmistake, inadvertence, \r\n  surprise or excusable neglect,â€ and argued the district court should have held \r\n  a hearing to ascertain damages.\r\nFollowing a hearing on the matter, the \r\n  trial court rejected Appellantâ€™s defenses and ordered the Alabama judgment be \r\n  given full effect in South Carolina.Â  Appellant then filed a motion to amend \r\n  the judgment, which the trial court denied.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Personal Jurisdiction\r\nAppellant contends the trial court erred in determining \r\n  Appellant had sufficient contacts with Alabama to bring Appellant within the \r\n  district courtâ€™s personal jurisdiction.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn accordance with the full faith and credit clause \r\n  of the United States Constitution, the courts of one state must give such force \r\n  and effect to a foreign judgment as the judgment would receive in the state \r\n  where rendered.Â  U.S. Const. Art. IV, Â§ 1; Carson v. Vance, 326 S.C. \r\n  543, 550, 485 S.E.2d 126, 130 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  At the same time, however, the \r\n  full faith and credit clause only binds a court to enforce the judgment if the \r\n  issuing court had jurisdiction to render the judgment.Â  Carson, 326 S.C. \r\n  at 548.Â  Thus, â€œ[a] defendant is always free to ignore the judicial proceedings, \r\n  risk a default judgment, and then challenge that judgment on jurisdictional \r\n  grounds in a collateral proceeding.â€Â  Ins. Corp. of Ireland, Ltd. v. Compagnie \r\n  des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 706 (1982).\r\nâ€œThe question of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident \r\n  defendant is one which must be resolved upon the facts of each particular case.Â  \r\n  The decision of the trial court should be affirmed unless unsupported by the \r\n  evidence or influenced by an error of law.â€Â  Moosally v. W.W. Norton &amp; \r\n  Co., Inc., 358 S.C. 320, 327, 594 S.E.2d 878, 882 (Ct. App. 2004) (citations \r\n  omitted).\r\nThe determination of whether a court may exercise \r\n  personal jurisdiction over a nonresident involves a two-step analysis: (1) the \r\n  nonresidentâ€™s conduct must meet the requirements of the stateâ€™s long-arm statute \r\n  and (2) the exercise of jurisdiction must comport with the requirements of the \r\n  due process clause.Â  Southern Plastics Co. v. Southern Commerce Bank, \r\n  310 S.C. 256, 259, 423 S.E.2d 128, 130 (1992).Â  Like those of many other states, \r\n  Alabamaâ€™s long-arm statute is construed to extend jurisdiction over nonresident \r\n  defendants to the full extent permitted by the due process clause.Â  Sieber \r\n  v. Campbell, 810 So.2d 641, 643-44 (Ala. 2001).Â  As a consequence, the two-part \r\n  jurisdictional analysis collapses into a single inquiry as to whether the defendant \r\n  had â€œminimal contactsâ€ with the forum state such that â€œmaintenance of the suit \r\n  does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.â€Â  \r\n  Intâ€™l Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945); see also \r\n  Marbury v. Am. Truetzschler, 111 F. Supp. 2d 1281, 1283 (M.D. Ala. 2000) \r\n  (â€œâ€˜When the courts of the forum State have interpreted the forumâ€™s long-arm \r\n  statute to confer jurisdiction to the limits allowed by federal due process, \r\n  state law need not be applied: [the court] need only ask whether the exercise \r\n  of jurisdiction over the nonresident defendant comports with due process.â€™â€ \r\n  (citing Vermeulen v. Renault U.S.A., Inc., 975 F.2d 746, 753 (11th Cir. \r\n  1992)).\r\nWe find such minimum contacts exist.Â  On at least \r\n  seven occasions, Appellant shipped lead-spent batteries to a company named International \r\n  Lead Company in Leeds, Alabama.Â  Although Appellant delivered the batteries \r\n  through an intermediary, Appellantâ€™s invoices reveal that it was purposefully \r\n  directing a product of its recycling business to a specific location in Alabama.Â  \r\n  Additionally, exercise of personal jurisdiction over Appellant does not offend \r\n  â€œtraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.â€Â  Intâ€™l Shoe, \r\n  326 U.S. at 316.Â  In the course of participating in an industry that regularly \r\n  implicates commerce between and among multiple states, Appellant voluntarily \r\n  conducted business with Alabama, thereby invoking the protection of its laws.Â  \r\n  In this manner, notions of fair play and substantial justice are both rightfully \r\n  served in requiring Appellant to answer in an Alabama court for any tortious \r\n  acts committed there.Â  Accordingly, the trial court correctly determined the \r\n  Alabama courtâ€™s exercise of personal jurisdiction over Appellant was proper.\r\nII.Â  Service of Process\r\nAppellant contends the trial court erred in determining \r\n  the Respondentâ€™s personal service of process on Myers was proper service on \r\n  the corporation.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œQuestions of fact arising on a motion to quash \r\n  service of process for lack of jurisdiction over the defendant are to be determined \r\n  by the court.Â  The findings of the [trial] court on such issues are binding \r\n  on the appellate court unless wholly unsupported by the evidence or manifestly \r\n  influenced or controlled by error of law.â€Â  Brown v. Carolina Emergency Physicians, \r\n  P.A., 348 S.C. 569, 583, 560 S.E.2d 624, 631 (Ct. App. 2001) (citations \r\n  omitted).\r\nAs outlined by both the Federal Rules of Civil \r\n  Procedure and the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, service of process \r\n  serves two purposes:Â  it confers personal jurisdiction on the court and it assures \r\n  the defendant has reasonable notice of the action.Â  Roche v. Young Bros., \r\n  Inc., of Florence, 318 S.C. 207, 209, 456 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1995).Â  Our courts \r\n  have never predicated effective service of process on exacting compliance with \r\n  the rules.Â  Rather, we inquire as to whether the plaintiff has sufficiently \r\n  complied with the rules as to confer personal jurisdiction and provide the defendant \r\n  with notice of the proceedings.Â  Id. at 210, 456 S.E.2d at 899.\r\nLike its federal counterpart, Rule 4(d)(1), SCRCP, \r\n  provides for service upon an agent only if authorized by appointment or by law.Â  \r\n  In determining whether an alleged agent has authority to receive process for \r\n  a defendant, we â€œmust look to the circumstances surrounding the relationship \r\n  and find authority which is either express or implied from the type of relationship \r\n  between the defendant and the alleged agent.â€Â  Moore v. Simpson, 322 \r\n  S.C. 518, 523, 473 S.E.2d 64, 67 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Here, Myers has been employed \r\n  by Appellant for approximately twenty years and regularly deals with the public.Â  \r\n  Moreover, Myers, Appellantâ€™s sole office employee, told the process server he \r\n  was authorized to accept service.Â  These circumstances imply Myers was authorized \r\n  to receive service.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court committed no error \r\n  in finding Respondentâ€™s personal service on Myers was reasonably calculated \r\n  to notify Appellant of the action.\r\nAFFIRMED.

Keesley, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-494\r\nSubmitted September 14, 2004 â€“ Filed \r\n  September 22, 2004 \r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Robert M. Dudek, of Columbia, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McMaster, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, \r\n  all of Columbia; and Solicitor Donald V. Myers, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â  Roger A. Stevens appeals \r\n  his convictions of murder and first-degree burglary.Â  His complaint centers \r\n  on the solicitorâ€™s opening statement.Â  He argues the trial judge should have \r\n  more fully sustained his objection to the statement or should have declared \r\n  a mistrial.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nIn his opening statement, the solicitor \r\n  said the following:\r\n\r\nMr. Bankston Derrick had devoted \r\n  most of his life to the service of others.Â  He lived in Saluda County.Â  He worked \r\n  in the school system.Â  He had reached that point in life that all that hard \r\n  work would be rewarded in retirement.Â  He was in his mid-sixties.\r\n\r\nDefense counsel objected.Â  \r\nAfter the trial judge sent the jury to its room, \r\n  defense counsel argued:\r\n\r\nThe defense objects that the \r\n  State has gone into the victimâ€™s character and what a great person he was and \r\n  how much he did for the community and what a great service to the community \r\n  he was.Â  None of that is admissible.Â  Itâ€™s all prejudicial.Â  Itâ€™s appealing \r\n  to the passion and prejudice of the jury and just telling them what a great \r\n  hero this guy was, and it has nothing to do with the issues which are who killed \r\n  him.Â  \r\n\r\nDefense counsel also moved for a mistrial.Â Â Â  \r\nThe trial judge ruled the objection was â€œsustained \r\n  in part and overruled in partâ€ and denied the â€œmotion for mistrial in full.â€Â  \r\n  When the jury returned to the courtroom, the trial judge stated that the objection \r\n  had been â€œsustained in part; overruled in part.â€Â  The solicitor then told the \r\n  jurors where the victim had lived and continued his opening statement. \r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Regarding the question \r\n  of whether the trial judge should have more fully sustained the objection of \r\n  Stevens to the solicitorâ€™s opening statement, the issue is not preserved.Â  Defense \r\n  counsel never asked the trial judge to explain which part of the objection he \r\n  had sustained and which part he had overruled.Â  See State v. Adams, \r\n  354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003) (holding arguments not raised to \r\n  or ruled upon by the trial court are not preserved for appellate review).\r\n 2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  As to the question of whether \r\n  the trial judge should have declared a mistrial because of the solicitorâ€™s remarks, \r\n  we find no abuse of its discretion in this instance because the defendant failed \r\n  to demonstrate prejudice.Â  See State v. Cooper, 334 S.C. 540, \r\n  514 S.E.2d 584 (1999) (holding the question of whether to grant or deny a mistrial \r\n  is within the sound discretion of the trial court and its ruling will not be \r\n  disturbed on appeal unless an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law \r\n  occurs); State v. Harris, 340 S.C. 59, 530 S.E.2d 626 (2000) (holding \r\n  a mistrial should be granted only when absolutely necessary and to receive a \r\n  mistrial the defendant must show error and resulting prejudice).Â  The solicitorâ€™s \r\n  opening statement could not have prejudiced Stevens because evidence, to which \r\n  Stevens did not object, supported each of the solicitorâ€™s challenged remarks.Â  \r\n  Cf. St. Louis-San Francisco Rwy. Co. v.

Workersâ€™ Compensation Commissionâ€™s order denying claimant Walter McQueen compensation.Â  \r\n  We reverse. 1Â  \r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nMcQueen was hired by StaffMark, a \r\n  company that provides temporary employees to other businesses, around January \r\n  11, 1999.Â  He was assigned to the Wal-Mart Distribution Center, where he worked \r\n  as an order filler.Â  \r\nDavid \r\n  Kessler, who had been McQueenâ€™s StaffMark supervisor, testified by deposition \r\n  that soon after McQueen began working, the manager at Wal-Mart wanted McQueen \r\n  let go because of poor work performance.Â  On Monday, January 25, 1999, Kessler \r\n  informed McQueen that his assignment at Wal-Mart was complete, which is the \r\n  terminology StaffMark used rather than stating someoneâ€™s employment was terminated.Â  \r\n  Kessler stated that he told McQueen to turn in all of his equipment.Â  He also \r\n  advised McQueen that if he went to the StaffMark office in Monroe, North Carolina, \r\n  that office might be able to find another job for him.Â  \r\nKessler \r\n  testified that about thirty minutes later, McQueen and his Wal-Mart supervisor \r\n  approached him.Â  The supervisor advised Kessler that McQueen had just told him \r\n  that McQueen had hurt his back.Â  In response to Kesslerâ€™s questioning, McQueen \r\n  stated he had hurt his back during his Thursday shift, which was the last night \r\n  he had worked.Â  Kessler stated McQueenâ€™s failure to notify his supervisor immediately \r\n  of the injury was in violation of StaffMarkâ€™s policies.Â  He explained that he \r\n  had given copies of StaffMarkâ€™s injury reports to the loss prevention office \r\n  and had requested that in case of an injury to a StaffMark employee when he \r\n  or the other StaffMark supervisor was not there, that the forms be filled out \r\n  and he or StaffMark employee Renee Haigler be called.Â  Kessler averred that \r\n  the first he heard of McQueenâ€™s injury was after he had terminated McQueenâ€™s \r\n  employment.Â  \r\nIn contrast \r\n  to Kesslerâ€™s testimony, McQueen testified that immediately after he felt â€œsomething \r\n  popâ€ in his back, he went to Michael Reese, a supervisor for the Wal-Mart Distribution \r\n  Center and explained to him what happened.Â  The accident happened in the early \r\n  morning hours of Friday, January 22, 1999.Â  He finished working that night and \r\n  went home around 3:30 a.m.Â  He went back to work the afternoon of Monday, January \r\n  25, 1999.Â  As soon as he arrived at the Distribution Center, he spoke again \r\n  with Reese.Â  Reese took him to the StaffMark supervisor whom McQueen called \r\n  â€œMr. Mullins.â€Â  McQueen testified Mullins informed them, â€œNo, you donâ€™t have \r\n  to fill out an accident report on him cause Iâ€™m gone (sic) let him go anyway.â€Â  \r\n  McQueen related Mullins then told him to turn in his equipment.Â  McQueen maintained \r\n  he had told Mullins about his injury before Mullins terminated his employment.Â  \r\n  \r\nMcQueen \r\n  had x-rays taken at Chesterfield General Hospital and sought treatment from \r\n  Dr. Thrailkill and the other doctors in that practice for four months until \r\n  he was released to return to work.Â  He stated the doctors referred him to a \r\n  specialist, but he did not see the specialist because he did not have the money \r\n  to pay for such a visit.Â  He is still bothered by the injury.Â  \r\nMcQueen \r\n  filed a claim for Workersâ€™ Compensation benefits.Â  StaffMark denied the claim.Â  \r\n  The single commissioner held McQueen had suffered a compensable injury and ordered \r\n  StaffMark to be responsible for all authorized medical treatment through the \r\n  date of maximum medical improvement.Â  The commissioner ruled any finding as \r\n  to permanent impairment or disability was premature, as McQueen had not yet \r\n  reached maximum medical improvement.Â  \r\nThe Appellate \r\n  Panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission reversed the order of the single \r\n  commissioner.Â  It listed the inconsistencies between McQueenâ€™s hearing testimony \r\n  and information he gave during his job application, doctorâ€™s visits, and deposition \r\n  testimony.Â  It noted that Kessler, who had left StaffMarkâ€™s employment and was \r\n  a military chaplain stationed in Germany, had no stake in the outcome of the \r\n  case.Â  It found Kessler to be the more credible witness and the one worthy of \r\n  belief while McQueenâ€™s testimony was not worthy of belief because of his omissions \r\n  inconsistencies, and misrepresentations.Â  The Appellate Panel held, â€œLooking \r\n  at the record as a whole, because claimantâ€™s testimony is not worthy of belief, \r\n  and there is no other evidence of accident or injury, the commissionâ€™s Order \r\n  should be reversed.â€\r\nThe circuit \r\n  court reversed the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision, reinstated the single commissionerâ€™s \r\n  order, and remanded the matter to the Appellate Panel for a determination of \r\n  the specific benefits due McQueen.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative \r\n  Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the South \r\n  Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, 276 S.C. 130, \r\n  135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  This court can reverse or modify the Appellate \r\n  Panelâ€™s decision only if the appellantâ€™s substantial rights have been prejudiced \r\n  because the decision is affected by an error of law or is clearly erroneous \r\n  in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  \r\n  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 454, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000); \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (Supp. 2003).Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is not \r\n  a mere scintilla of evidence nor evidence viewed from one side, but such evidence, \r\n  when the whole record is considered, as would allow reasonable minds to reach \r\n  the conclusion the [Appellate Panel] reached.â€Â  Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, \r\n  535 S.E.2d at 442.Â  The possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions \r\n  does not prevent the Appellate Panelâ€™s conclusions from being supported by substantial \r\n  evidence.Â  Tiller v. Natâ€™l Health Care Ctr., 334 S.C. 333, 338, 513 S.E.2d \r\n  843, 845 (1999).\r\nThe Appellate \r\n  Panel is the ultimate fact finder in workersâ€™ compensation cases and is not \r\n  bound by the single commissionerâ€™s findings of fact.Â  Ross v. American Red \r\n  Cross, 298 S.C. 490, 492, 381 S.E.2d 728, 730 (1989).Â  â€œThe final determination \r\n  of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to \r\n  the [Appellate Panel].Â  It is not the task of this Court to weigh the evidence \r\n  as found by the [Appellate Panel].â€Â  Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d \r\n  at 442 (citations omitted).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nStaffMark \r\n  argues the circuit court erred in reversing the decision of the Appellate Panel.Â  \r\n  We agree.Â  \r\nKessler and \r\n  McQueen presented competing versions about how McQueen reported his injury.Â  \r\n  McQueen stated he immediately told his Wal-Mart supervisor about the injury \r\n  when it occurred Friday morning and that he and the supervisor told the StaffMark \r\n  supervisor about the injury at the beginning of McQueenâ€™s Monday shift, before \r\n  he was fired.Â  Kessler, on the other hand, testified that it was not until thirty \r\n  minutes after he fired McQueen that McQueen and the Wal-Mart supervisor approached \r\n  him to report the injury.Â  Furthermore, according to Kessler, the Wal-Mart supervisor \r\n  stated that McQueen had just told him about the injury.Â  \r\nThe Appellate \r\n  Panel found Kessler to be more credible as he was no longer employed by StaffMark \r\n  and thus had no stake in the matter.Â  The Panel further found McQueen to be \r\n  not worthy of belief.Â  It noted that while McQueen had listed on his employment \r\n  application at StaffMark that he had been employed by a trucking company in \r\n  Virginia for thirty years, he testified at the hearing that he had worked a \r\n  number of different places.Â  The Panel described how McQueen had been inconsistent \r\n  in his deposition and hearing testimony concerning previous workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  claims.Â  Although he testified in his deposition that he had no prior workersâ€™ \r\n  compensation claims, at the hearing he admitted to a claim in Virginia.Â  The \r\n  Panel noted that McQueen had been inconsistent regarding his symptoms, testifying \r\n  at the hearing that he had back pain with pain radiating down the right leg \r\n  only, while describing bilateral leg pain at his initial doctorâ€™s visit.Â  The \r\n  Appellate Panel related how during McQueenâ€™s hearing testimony he denied filing \r\n  workersâ€™ compensation claims against a subsequent employer but recanted when \r\n  challenged and acknowledged two workersâ€™ compensation claims against Powell \r\n  Manufacturing.Â  It noted that when McQueen sought treatment for the hand injury \r\n  that was the basis of his claim against Powell, he told the emergency room staff \r\n  that he had just been terminated.Â  He also told them he had consumed half a \r\n  pint of liquor.Â  At the hearing, he denied both of these statements.Â  \r\nThe Appellate \r\n  Panel found McQueenâ€™s testimony was directly refuted by Kesslerâ€™s and it was \r\n  not possible to believe both witnesses.Â  It concluded McQueenâ€™s testimony was \r\n  not worthy of belief because of his omissions, inconsistencies, and misrepresentations.Â  \r\n  \r\nThe circuit \r\n  court rejected the Appellate Panelâ€™s determination of the credibility of the \r\n  witnesses.Â  It explained that the single commissioner had the opportunity to \r\n  observe McQueenâ€™s testimony and demeanor and such opportunity allowed her to \r\n  accurately gauge his credibility.Â  On the other hand, the court noted, no one \r\n  had the opportunity to personally observe the demeanor of Kessler, who testified \r\n  by international telephone deposition, and thereby evaluate his credibility.Â  \r\n  However, as stated above, issues of witness credibility are for the Appellate \r\n  Panel to decide, not for this court or the circuit court to decide.Â  See \r\n  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).\r\nThe circuit \r\n  court found that objective medical findings in the file substantiated McQueenâ€™s \r\n  claim of injury.Â  However, even in McQueenâ€™s medical records, the only evidence \r\n  that he was injured while working for StaffMark was provided by McQueen himself \r\n  in his statements to the doctor.Â  The Appellate Panel acted within its authority \r\n  in discounting any statements by McQueen, whom it found to be not worthy of \r\n  belief.Â  Absent any statements or testimony from McQueen, the record is devoid \r\n  of any evidence of an injury by accident while McQueen was working for StaffMark, \r\n  as the Appellate Panel found.Â  Accordingly, we hold the circuit court erred \r\n  in reversing the decision of the Appellate Panel.Â Â  Thus, the order of the circuit \r\n  court is REVERSED and the decision of the Appellate Panel reinstated.Â  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF and KITTREDGE, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n  1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-496","title":"Skinner v.

Keefer, all of Charleston, for Respondent\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is an appeal from an order \r\n  granting respondents, Trident Medical Center, L.L.C. and Cheryl Aloway, a new \r\n  trial absolute following a jury verdict for Dr. Bruce Skinner on claims of defamation, \r\n  negligent supervision, and conversion.Â  We affirm.  \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThis action arose out of certain events Dr. Skinner \r\n  alleged occurred in connection with his employment as an internist with Trident \r\n  Medical Center, L.L.C.Â  Dr. Skinner began his employment with Trident on January \r\n  5, 1998 in an office in St. Stephen, South Carolina.Â  Originally, Trident planned \r\n  to keep Dr. Skinner at the St. Stephen office only a short time, and thereafter \r\n  relocate him to a new office in the Crowfield area.Â  According to Trident, due \r\n  to market factors and structural problems with the facility, Trident decided \r\n  to close the St. Stephen office.Â  Because of several changes in circumstances, \r\n  Trident needed the doctor at the Crowfield location to have hospital admitting \r\n  privileges.Â  Dr. Skinner did not have those privileges, and Trident decided \r\n  to terminate Dr. Skinnerâ€™s employment per its standard contract allowing sixty \r\n  days notice for termination without cause.Â  Dr. Skinner was provided with notice \r\n  in April 1998 and his position was terminated in June 1998.Â  \r\nDuring the time Dr. Skinner worked in the St. Stephen \r\n  office he had conflicts with the area office manager, Cheryl Aloway, over office \r\n  issues such as billing and the condition of the office.Â  Following his termination, \r\n  Dr. Skinner was unsuccessful in finding employment as a physician.Â  Thereafter, \r\n  Dr. Skinner instituted this action against Trident and Aloway alleging, among \r\n  other things, that (1) Aloway made false, slanderous statements about Dr. Skinner, \r\n  (2) Trident negligently supervised Aloway, and (3) Trident had converted a patient \r\n  list Dr. Skinner had supplied to Trident to its own use and refused to return \r\n  the list to Dr. Skinner.Â  Dr. Skinner maintained his difficulty in obtaining \r\n  employment as a physician was due to malicious slander by Aloway, Tridentâ€™s \r\n  negligent supervision of Aloway, and conversion of a computer patient list of \r\n  Dr. Skinnerâ€™s.Â  Trident and Aloway asserted that Dr. Skinnerâ€™s inability to \r\n  find physician related employment was due to a number of factors including his \r\n  lack of admitting privileges and board certification, the fact that he was out \r\n  of work for a year and a half prior to his employment with Trident and had not \r\n  built up a network of relations with other doctors and hospitals, and the fact \r\n  that Dr. Skinnerâ€™s application letters gave indications to prospective employers \r\n  that he was unemployable.Â  \r\nDr. Skinnerâ€™s slander claim stems from statements \r\n  made by Aloway, who was an area manager for Trident overseeing eight separate \r\n  offices, including the St. Stephen office where Dr. Skinner worked.Â  Aloway \r\n  admittedly made statements to three other Trident employees that Dr. Skinner \r\n  was believed to have taken some equipment from the office that he was not supposed \r\n  to take, and that he had sabotaged the office by leaving water running in a \r\n  stopped-up sink overnight.Â  \r\nAloway testified as to what prompted her statements \r\n  that Dr. Skinner had sabotaged the office.Â  She stated Dr. Skinner was supposed \r\n  to fill in at the St. Stephen office while Trident awaited the arrival of a \r\n  doctor from Canada to take over that office.Â  At that time, the plan was then \r\n  to move Dr. Skinner to the Crowfield office.Â  However, the Canadian doctor had \r\n  trouble with his visa, possibly postponing his arrival by six months.Â  Dr. Skinner \r\n  had been complaining about the condition of the St. Stephen office, and expressed \r\n  concern that he would have to stay there and would never get to the Crowfield \r\n  office.Â  One of Alowayâ€™s superiors, Ian Watson, was scheduled to visit the St. \r\n  Stephen office to evaluate the condition of the building.Â  Around that time, \r\n  Dr. Skinner made a comment to Aloway concerning whether he should make the office \r\n  look worse than it actually was, in anticipation of Watsonâ€™s visit.Â  The night \r\n  before Watson was scheduled to come to the St. Stephan location, there was a \r\n  leak in the kitchen that flooded out into the hallway and onto the carpet.Â  \r\n  When the plumber arrived, he could find nothing to have caused the leak, but \r\n  indicated he believed someone had intentionally stopped up the sink, let the \r\n  water runoff, and then unstopped it.Â  When Aloway talked to Dr. Skinner about \r\n  the leak, he indicated he felt the housekeeper had done it.Â  The housekeeper \r\n  denied having caused the leak, and told Aloway that when she left the building \r\n  that night, Dr. Skinner was still there.Â  Aloway theorized that if the St. Stephen \r\n  office were to close, Dr. Skinner would be able to get to the Crowfield location \r\n  sooner.Â  She thus came to the conclusion that, if anyone had caused the damage, \r\n  it was Dr. Skinner.Â  \r\nAs to the missing equipment, Aloway testified, \r\n  while Dr. Skinner had been authorized to take some equipment home with him, \r\n  she suspected he had taken some other equipment from the office for which he \r\n  had not received permission.Â  When she expressed these concerns to her superior, \r\n  she was told to simply call Dr. Skinner and ask him to bring the equipment back.Â  \r\n  She was not to make a specific list of the items, but was to leave it up to \r\n  Dr. Skinnerâ€™s discretion as to what he would return.Â  Aloway arranged to have \r\n  the items returned to Tridentâ€™s Crowfield office.Â  When she went there to pick \r\n  up the equipment, she was surprised and frustrated to find only one small box \r\n  that did not contain all the items she had expected, and questioned the staff \r\n  as to whether that was all that was left there.Â  When the staff indicated that \r\n  was the extent of the returned items and then questioned Aloway, she expressed \r\n  to the three co-workers that Dr. Skinner had taken some things.Â  She further \r\n  admitted that she may have â€œblurted outâ€ that Dr. Skinner had also sabotaged \r\n  his office.Â  \r\nAloway also admitted she may have expressed her \r\n  beliefs regarding Dr. Skinner to another person after she was no longer employed \r\n  by Trident.Â  After leaving Trident in August 1998, Aloway went to work for an \r\n  association of independent physicians (IPA).Â  Dr. Bounds, who served on the \r\n  board of directors of IPA, received a call from Dr. Skinner, asking if Dr. Bounds \r\n  had heard Aloway say anything negative about him.Â  At that time, Aloway had \r\n  never mentioned Dr. Skinner to Dr. Bounds and Dr. Bounds informed Dr. Skinner \r\n  of this.Â  Thereafter, Dr. Bounds saw Aloway at an IPA meeting and asked her \r\n  what had occurred with Dr. Skinner.Â  Aloway then responded that Dr. Skinner \r\n  had stolen an EKG machine and had sabotaged the St. Stephen office.Â  Aloway \r\n  testified she only made this statement as a direct answer to an inquiry from \r\n  a board member who was her boss, and she would not have said anything about \r\n  it if it had not been raised in a question from her boss.Â  Aloway testified \r\n  that she still believed the statements she made about Dr. Skinner were true.Â  \r\n\r\nDr. Skinnerâ€™s conversion claim involves a list containing \r\n  potential patient contact information.Â  Dr. Skinner obtained this list of potential \r\n  patients in the summer of 1996, while he was employed at the Naval Hospital \r\n  in Charleston.Â  After he began his employment with Trident, Dr. Skinner gave \r\n  the list to Aloway so that announcements of his employment could be sent out.Â  \r\n  Aloway testified she passed the list on to a secretary at Trident.Â  She further \r\n  stated that Trident had not requested the list, but Dr. Skinner had suggested \r\n  they use the list for the announcement and Trident agreed.Â  However, the list \r\n  ultimately was not used due to Dr. Skinnerâ€™s termination.Â  Dr. Skinner requested \r\n  return of the list when he was terminated, but the list was lost and Trident \r\n  was never able to locate it.Â  Trident and Aloway presented evidence that, because \r\n  the list was around two years old by the time Dr. Skinner left Trident and included \r\n  military personnel who likely had moved on, it was of little to no value.Â  They \r\n  further presented evidence that Dr. Skinner was not the rightful owner of the \r\n  list and that Trident had not used the list for its own benefit.Â  \r\nThe case was submitted to the jury under the causes \r\n  of action of slander, conversion, and negligent supervision.Â  Without objection, \r\n  the jury received instruction on the law of defamation which included statements \r\n  made under a qualified privilege [2]  and/or statements invited or procured by a plaintiff such that \r\n  the publication was insufficient to support an action for defamation. \r\n  [3] Â  The jury further received instruction on the law of conversion. [4] Â  \r\nOn December 19, 2002, the jury returned its verdict.Â  \r\n  Originally, the juryâ€™s verdict was as follows: (a) for Dr. Skinner on the conversion \r\n  claim in the amount of $250,000.00 actual damages, (b) for Dr. Skinner against \r\n  Aloway individually on the defamation claim for $25,000.00 actual and $25,000.00 \r\n  punitive damages, (c) for Dr. Skinner against both Aloway and Trident on the \r\n  defamation claim for $1 million actual and $10 million punitive damages, and \r\n  (d) for Dr. Skinner against Trident on the negligent supervision claim in the \r\n  amount of $10 million actual damages.Â  The court and the parties agreed that \r\n  actual damages could not differ for the defamation claim against Aloway and \r\n  the defamation claim against Trident, which was only vicariously liable.Â  In \r\n  addition, the court and the parties agreed it was illogical to award greater \r\n  damages for the defamation claim than the negligent supervision claim.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the court instructed the jury to clarify its verdict on the defamation and negligent \r\n  supervision claims, but did not resubmit the conversion action to the jury.Â  \r\n  When the jury returned after further instructions, it found for Dr. Skinner \r\n  in the amount of $10 million for negligent supervision against Trident, and \r\n  against both Trident and Aloway in the amount of $10 million actual damages \r\n  and $10 million punitive damages for slander.Â  Dr. Skinner subsequently elected \r\n  to recover the slander award rather than the negligent supervision award.Â  \r\nIn an order filed on June 23, 2003, the trial judge \r\n  exercised his discretion as the thirteenth juror and granted Trident and Aloway \r\n  a new trial.Â  He found the evidence did not support the verdicts and justice \r\n  had not prevailed.Â  In the alternative, the trial judge concluded a new trial \r\n  was warranted because the verdicts were so excessive as to indicate they were \r\n  the result of passion, prejudice, caprice, or some other influence outside the \r\n  evidence presented.Â  Dr. Skinner appeals the order granting a new trial.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDr.\r\nSkinner argues the trial court erred in finding the evidence did not justify the\r\nverdicts on the conversion and defamation awards and therefore the order\r\ngranting a new trial under the thirteenth juror doctrine should be reversed.&nbsp;\r\nWe disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe\r\nthirteenth juror doctrine is a vehicle by which the trial judge may grant a new\r\ntrial absolute when he finds that the evidence does not justify the verdict.&nbsp; Folkens v. Hunt, 300 S.C. 251, 254, 387 S.E.2d 265,\r\n267 (1990).&nbsp; Such a ruling has also\r\nbeen termed a granting of a new trial upon the facts.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; The\r\ntrial judge has the authority to grant a new trial outright when, sitting as the\r\nthirteenth juror charged with the duty of seeing that justice is done, he is\r\nconvinced that a new trial is necessitated on the basis of the facts in the\r\ncase.&nbsp; Graham v. Whitaker,\r\n282 S.C. 393, 401, 321 S.E.2d 40, 45 (1984).&nbsp;\r\nThis doctrine is so named because it entitles the trial judge to sit, in\r\nessence, as the thirteenth juror when he finds the evidence does not justify the\r\nverdict, and then to grant a new trial based solely upon the facts.&nbsp;\r\nNorton v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 350 S.C. 473, 478, 567 S.E.2d 851,\r\n854 (2002).&nbsp; â€œ[T]he trial judge is\r\nthe thirteenth juror, possessing the veto power to the Nth degree, and, it must\r\nbe presumed, recognizes and appreciates his responsibility, and exercises the\r\ndiscretion vested in him with fairness and impartiality.â€&nbsp;\r\nWorrell v. South Carolina Power Co., 186 S.C. 306, 313-14, 195\r\nS.E. 638, 641 (1938).&nbsp; As the\r\nthirteenth juror, the trial judge can hang the jury by refusing to agree to a\r\njury verdict that is otherwise unanimous.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nThe effect is the same as if the jury failed to reach a verdict,\r\nresulting in a new trial.&nbsp; Folkens,\r\n300 S.C. at 254, 387 S.E.2d at 267.&nbsp; Neither\r\njudge nor jury is required to give reasons for the outcome.&nbsp;\r\nId.&nbsp; Further, a trial\r\njudgeâ€™s order granting or denying a new trial upon the facts will not be\r\ndisturbed unless his decision is wholly unsupported by the evidence, or the\r\nconclusion reached was controlled by an error of law.&nbsp;\r\nId.&nbsp; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n    As to the conversion claim, Dr. Skinner contends \r\n      the information contained in the patient list would have enabled him to \r\n      establish his own practice and the $250,000 award therefore was not excessive.Â  \r\n      He further argues that, because the defamation was per se, \r\n      general damages are presumed, and that, along with evidence presented regarding \r\n      malicious actions by Trident and Aloway as well as Dr. Skinnerâ€™s resulting \r\n      unemployment and the intangible injuries suffered by him, justified the \r\n      award.Â  \r\n    In reviewing the trial courtâ€™s decision to \r\n      grant a new trial under the thirteenth juror doctrine, this court does not, \r\n      however, look to whether the evidence presented below could support the \r\n      juryâ€™s verdict.Â  The granting of a new trial upon the facts is not the equivalent \r\n      of granting a directed verdict.Â  McEntire v. Mooregard Exterminating \r\n      Servs., Inc., 353 S.C. 629, 632, 578 S.E.2d 746, 748 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\n      Unlike a directed verdict motion, in considering whether to grant a new \r\n      trial under the thirteenth juror doctrine, the trial judge weighs the evidence, \r\n      and he need not view it in a light most favorable to the opposing party.Â  \r\n      Id.Â  Though the trial judge may be compelled to submit the issues \r\n      to the jury, it does not follow that he cannot subsequently grant a new \r\n      trial absolute under the thirteenth juror doctrine.Â  Worrell, 186 \r\n      S.C. at 313-14, 195 S.E. at 641.Â  Rather, our review is limited to consideration \r\n      of whether evidence exists to support the trial courtâ€™s order.Â  Folkens, \r\n      300 S.C. at 255, 387 S.E.2d at 267.Â  Unless the decision to grant a new \r\n      trial on the facts is wholly unsupported by the evidence or the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n      conclusion was controlled by an error of law, the order will not be disturbed \r\n      on appeal.Â  Id.Â  Where conflicting evidence exists on the contested \r\n      issues, â€œthe trial courtâ€™s ruling is not wholly unsupported by the evidence,â€ \r\n      and its decision will not be overturned.Â  Id. at 255, 387 S.E.2d \r\n      at 267.\r\n    Under our limited scope of review, we cannot \r\n      say the courtâ€™s ruling is â€œwholly unsupported by the evidence.â€Â  Conflicting \r\n      evidence was presented by the parties as to whether the statements made \r\n      by Aloway were privileged and/or invited.Â  Further, the evidence was in \r\n      conflict as to whether Trident was properly excused from returning the patient \r\n      list to Dr. Skinner because the list was simply lost rather than intentionally \r\n      withheld, whether Dr. Sinner had title to or the right to possession of \r\n      the list, or whether the list had any value such that the failure to return \r\n      it resulted in any damage to Dr. Skinner.Â  Further, there is no indication, \r\n      and appellant does not argue, that the trial judge was controlled by an \r\n      error of law, such as the application of an incorrect standard.Â  Accordingly, \r\n      we find no error in the trial judgeâ€™s decision to grant a new trial pursuant \r\n      to the thirteenth juror doctrine \r\n      [5]  and the order below is\r\n    AFFIRMED\r\n    HEARN, C.J., and HUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n   \r\n    \r\n    [1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n  \r\n   \r\n     \r\n      [2] â€œA communication made in good faith on any subject matter in which \r\n      the person communicating has an interest or duty is qualifiedly privileged \r\n      if made to a person with a corresponding interest or duty even though it \r\n      contains matter which, without this privilege, would be actionable.â€Â  Murray \r\n      v.

Koutrakos, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n PER \r\n  CURIAM:&nbsp; Travelers Home Mortgage \r\n  Services, Inc. brought this declaratory judgment action against Johnel Mosley \r\n  and Ernest Mosley seeking a declaration that a deed executed by Johnel as purported \r\n  attorney-in-fact for Ernest was valid.Â  The trial court found for Travelers \r\n  on its motions for default judgment and summary judgment.Â  We affirm. 1\r\nFACTSÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  \r\nThe subject property is located at \r\n  1432 Pepper Lane, Orangeburg, South Carolina.Â  In 1985, Ellis and Son, Inc. \r\n  conveyed the property to Ernest and his wife, Shirley Mosley.Â  In 1995, Shirley \r\n  conveyed her interest in the property to her brother-in-law, Johnel, for $17,000.Â  \r\n\r\nThe deed at issue in this case was \r\n  executed on March 20, 1996.Â  The deed purported to convey Ernestâ€™s interest \r\n  in the property to Johnel.Â  It is signed by â€œErnest Moseley2 by Johnel Moseley attorney-in-fact \r\n  for Ernest Moseley.â€Â  Ernest was incarcerated in federal prison at the time \r\n  Johnel executed the 1996 deed.Â  \r\nOn April 23, 1996, Johnel executed \r\n  a mortgage on the property with Cityscape Corporation in the original principal \r\n  amount of $42,000.Â  Johnel subsequently refinanced the debt on the property \r\n  by executing a mortgage for $61,000 to Collinbrook Mortgage Corporation on January \r\n  23, 1998.Â  From the proceeds of the loan secured by this mortgage, Johnel paid \r\n  $42,000 to satisfy the Cityscape mortgage.Â  Collinbrook assigned the 1998 mortgage \r\n  to Travelers.Â  \r\nJohnel defaulted on the loan secured \r\n  by the Travelers mortgage and Travelers foreclosed.Â  Travelers was the successful \r\n  bidder at the foreclosure sale and the master issued a masterâ€™s deed conveying \r\n  the property to Travelers.Â  \r\nOn May 29, 2001, Travelers filed the \r\n  present action against Johnel and Ernest seeking a declaratory judgment that \r\n  the 1996 deed executed by Johnel as attorney-in-fact for Ernest was valid and \r\n  conveyed the property in fee simple absolute to Johnel such that any interest \r\n  Ernest had in the property was extinguished.Â  Travelers served Johnel on July \r\n  28, 2001.Â  Johnel failed to file an answer, notice of appearance, or other pleading.Â  \r\n  Travelers served Ernest on August 30, 2001, at the federal prison in Yazoo City, \r\n  Mississippi.Â  Ernest responded with a letter to Travelers that was filed with \r\n  the court.Â  In the letter Ernest stated that he was involved with Johnel in \r\n  a lawsuit over Johnelâ€™s illegal signing of Ernestâ€™s name.Â  \r\nIn October of 2001, Travelers filed \r\n  and served an amended complaint.Â  Neither Johnel nor Ernest answered; therefore, \r\n  Travelers filed affidavits of default.Â  Travelers filed a petition seeking a \r\n  guardian ad litem (GAL) appointment for Ernest pursuant to Rule 17(c), SCRCP,3 due to his incarceration.Â  Edward D. Sullivan was appointed GAL \r\n  for Ernest.Â  The GAL filed a motion to set aside Ernestâ€™s default and for leave \r\n  to file responsive pleadings.Â  The GAL also filed an answer to the amended complaint \r\n  with a counterclaim seeking a declaration that the subject property belonged \r\n  to Ernest.Â  Travelers filed a motion for default judgment against Ernest and \r\n  Johnel, or in the alternative, for default judgment against Johnel and for summary \r\n  judgment against Ernest.Â  The GAL filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial court granted Travelersâ€™ \r\n  motion for default judgment, or alternatively, for summary judgment and denied \r\n  Ernestâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  The court also ruled as an alternative \r\n  Travelers would be entitled to equitable subrogation in the amount of $42,000, \r\n  which essentially operates as an equitable lien on Ernestâ€™s 50% undivided interest.Â  \r\n  This appeal followed.Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhen reviewing the grant of a summary \r\n  judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard which governs \r\n  the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there \r\n  is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled \r\n  to judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Baril v. Aiken Regâ€™l Med. Ctrs., 352 \r\n  S.C. 271, 279-80, 573 S.E.2d 830, 835 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  The evidence should \r\n  be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id. at \r\n  280, 573 S.E.2d at 835.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nErnest argues the deed to Johnel was \r\n  void ab initio because there was no written, recorded power of attorney \r\n  granting Johnel authority to execute the deed.&nbsp; Ernest is correct that \r\n  â€œa power of attorney should be evidenced by an instrument in writing.â€ In \r\n  the Matter of Celsor, 330 S.C. 497, 501, 499 S.E.2d 809, 811 (1998) (citing \r\n  3 Am.Jur. Agency Â§ 23 (1986)).&nbsp; However, even if Johnel did not \r\n  act pursuant to a valid power of attorney in executing the deed as attorney-in-fact \r\n  for Ernest, Ernest ratified the transfer in his complaint in a lawsuit he filed \r\n  against Johnel, in which Ernest admitted he had agreed to transfer the property \r\n  to Johnel.&nbsp; \r\nOne whose name has been signed to an instrument without \r\nauthorization may ratify the signature and become bound thereby.&nbsp; 3 Am.Jur.2d \r\nAgency Â§ 188 (2002). Ratification, as it relates to the law of agency, \r\nmeans the express or implied adoption and confirmation by one person of an act \r\nor contract performed or entered into in his behalf by another who at the time \r\nassumed to act as his agent.&nbsp; Lincoln v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co, \r\n300 S.C. 188, 191, 386 S.E.2d 801, 803 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  The three essential elements \r\nrequired to prove ratification are:Â  â€œ(1) acceptance by the principal of the benefits \r\nof the agentâ€™s acts; (2) full knowledge of the facts; and (3) circumstances or \r\nan affirmative election indicating an intention to adopt the unauthorized arrangements.â€Â  \r\nId. \r\n  \r\n  On April 7, 2000, Ernest filed a pro se action against Johnel \r\n  alleging the following in his complaint: \r\n \r\n  22.Â  Around the beginning of 1996, \r\n    the Plaintiff Ernest Mosely, needing $10,000.00 to pay for some legal expenses, \r\n    arranged with the Defendant Johnel Mosely to obtain a $30,000.00 mortgage \r\n    on the Pepper Lane property.Â  Of this amount, $10,000.00 was to be given to \r\n    Ernest Mosely, $10,000.00 was to be distributed to Ernestâ€™s wife â€“ Shirley \r\n    Mosely, and Johnel Mosely was to keep $10,000.00 for himself.Â  \r\n  23.&nbsp; In order to facilitate \r\n    the obtaining of the mortgage and due to Ernest Moselyâ€™s incarceration, Ernest \r\n    Mosely agreed to transfer title to the Pepper Lane property to Johnel Mosely, \r\n    with Johnel Moselyâ€™s promise that when Ernest Mosely was released from incarceration, \r\n    Johnel Mosely would transfer title of the property back to Ernest Mosely.\r\n\r\nErnestâ€™s\r\ncomplaint in the 2000 lawsuit clearly shows Ernest knew of the transfer of\r\nproperty, approved it, and reaped the benefits of it.&nbsp;\r\nErnest accepted the benefits of Johnelâ€™s act by receiving $10,000 for\r\nhimself and another $10,000 for his wife as a result of the Cityscape mortgage.&nbsp; In addition, Ernestâ€™s 2000 complaint which states he\r\nâ€œagreed to transfer title to the Pepper Lane propertyâ€ shows Ernest had full\r\nknowledge of Johnelâ€™s act of conveying the property to himself.&nbsp;\r\nWhile\r\nErnest argues he was unaware of or did not ratify Johnelâ€™s act of encumbering\r\nthe property in excess of $30,000 for the Cityscape mortgage or $61,000 for the\r\nTravelers mortgage, this argument does not go to the issue at handâ€“whether a\r\nvalid transfer of property occurred.&nbsp; The\r\nonly issue to be determined in this litigation is whether the deed validly\r\ntransferred the property to Johnel.  We\r\nconclude it did.Whether Ernest\r\nreceived the proper share of the Cityscape mortgage proceeds is not for this\r\ncourt to determine in the present action.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\nBased\r\non our decision that the trial court properly granted Travelersâ€™ motion for\r\nsummary judgment, we do not reach the remaining issues on appeal regarding\r\ndefault and equitable subrogation.
