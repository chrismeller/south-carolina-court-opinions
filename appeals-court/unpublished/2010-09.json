(Mother) appeals from the\r\n  family court's order terminating her parental rights to her minor children\r\n  (Children).Â  Mother argues the family court erred in terminating her parental rights pursuant to sections\r\n  63-7-2570(2) (failure to remedy the conditions that caused removal) and (8) (in\r\n  foster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (2010).Â  Mother also appeals the family court's finding termination of parental rights\r\n  (TPR) was in Children's best interests.Â  Additionally, Mother argues the family\r\n  court erred in terminating her parental rights because the guardian ad litem (the\r\n  Guardian) did not conduct an independent assessment.Â Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n1. We affirm the\r\n  family court's finding Children resided in foster care, under the\r\n  responsibility of the state, for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570 (2010)\r\n  (stating the family court may order TPR upon finding one or more of the eleven\r\n  statutory grounds is satisfied and also finding TPR is in the best interest of\r\n  the child); Â§ 63-7-2570(8) (explaining one statutory ground for TPR is met when\r\n  &quot;[t]he child has been in foster care under the responsibility of the State\r\n  for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months&quot;); Charleston County\r\n    Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Jackson, 368 S.C. 87, 101-02, 627 S.E.2d 765, 773\r\n  (Ct. App. 2006) (noting the purpose of this statutory ground &quot;is to ensure\r\n  that children do not languish in foster care when termination of parental\r\n  rights would be in their best interests&quot;).\r\n2. We affirm the family\r\n  court's finding Mother did not remedy the condition causing removal.Â  See Â§ 63-7-2570(2) (stating one statutory ground for TPR is met when the child has\r\n  been removed and &quot;has been out of the home for a period of six months . .\r\n  . and the parent has not remedied the conditions which caused the removal.&quot;); Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Phillips, 365 S.C. 572, 579, 618 S.E.2d 922,\r\n  925&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005) (&quot;[T]he statute allows for termination of\r\n  parental rights where the parent has not remedied the conditions causing\r\n  removal. This does not suggest that an attempt to remedy alone is adequate to\r\n  preserve parental rights. Otherwise, the statute would be couched in such terms.\r\n  The attempt must have, in fact, remedied the conditions.&quot;).Â  \r\n3. Despite Mother's\r\n  arguments to the contrary, we find the Department of Social Services (DSS)\r\n  proved by clear and convincing evidence that termination of Mother's parental\r\n  rights was in the best interests of Children.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2620 (2010) (explaining when the child's interests and the\r\n  parental rights conflict, the child's interests shall prevail); Charleston\r\n    County Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. King, 369 S.C. 96, 105, 631 S.E.2d 239, 244\r\n  (2006) (&quot;When reviewing the family court decision, appellate courts may\r\n  make their own conclusions of whether DSS proved by clear and convincing\r\n  evidence that parental rights should be terminated.&quot;); Jackson, 368\r\n  S.C. at 95, 627 S.E.2d at 770 (stating despite the appellate court's broad\r\n  scope of review, it should not necessarily disregard the findings of the family\r\n  court, which was in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the\r\n  witnesses and to assign weight to their testimony); Id. (&quot;In a TPR\r\n  case, the best interest of the child is the paramount consideration.&quot;).\r\n4. We also find\r\n  clear and convincing evidence the Guardian represented Children's best\r\n  interest.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  63-11-510 (2010) (stating the responsibilities and duties of a guardian include (1)\r\n  representing a child's best interest; (2) advocating for\r\n  the welfare and rights of a child in an abuse or neglect proceeding; (3)\r\n  conducting an independent assessment of the facts, the needs of the child, and\r\n  the available resources within the family and community to meet those needs; (4)\r\n  maintaining a case record; (5)\r\n  providing the family court with a written report; (6)\r\n  monitoring compliance with family court orders and make motions to enforce the\r\n  orders if necessary; and (7)\r\n  protecting and promoting the best interests of the child); S.C.

With\r\n  regard to the family court's denial of Husband's motion for default judgment:Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-10 (1985) (listing adultery and habitual drunkenness, which\r\n  includes the habitual use of any narcotic drug, as grounds for divorce); Rule\r\n  17, SCRFC (deferring to the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure for the\r\n  procedure for entry of a default judgment but allowing defendant to be &quot;heard\r\n  at the merits hearing on issues of custody of children, visitation, alimony,\r\n  support, equitable distribution, and counsel fees&quot;); Rule 55, SCRCP\r\n  (establishing procedure for seeking a default judgment that requires\r\n  procurement of a clerk's entry of default and a subsequent hearing by the court\r\n  to enter the judgment and providing &quot;[i]f, in order to enable the court to\r\n  enter judgment or to carry it into effect, it is necessary . . . to establish\r\n  the truth of any averment by evidence or to make an investigation of any other\r\n  matter, the court may conduct such hearing or order such references as it deems\r\n  necessary and proper . . .&quot;); Watson v. Watson, 319 S.C. 92, 94,\r\n  460 S.E.2d 394, 395 (1995) (requiring plaintiff in a divorce action to prove\r\n  his grounds for divorce as well as pleading them).Â  \r\n2. With\r\n  regard to the family court's dismissal of Husband's action for divorce: Â Re:Â  Family Court Benchmark, S.C. Sup. Ct. order dated May 9, 2006 (mandating all\r\n  domestic relations cases &quot;shall be disposed of within 365 days of their\r\n    filing&quot; and assigning oversight of all family court cases older than\r\n  365 days and for which no final hearing has been requested to the Chief\r\n  Administrative Judge for the county in which they were filed) (emphasis added). \r\nWe dismiss as moot the\r\n  remainder of Husband's issues.Â  &quot;A case becomes moot when judgment, if\r\n  rendered, will have no practical legal effect upon existing controversy. Â This\r\n  is true when some event occurs making it impossible for [the] reviewing [c]ourt\r\n  to grant effectual relief.&quot; Â Mathis v. S.C.

Florian, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  After a hearing, the South Carolina Department of Corrections (the Department)\r\n  entered a disciplinary conviction against Antonio Moragne for violating Rule\r\n  806 of the Department's disciplinary code by blackmailing other inmates.Â  The\r\n  Administrative Law Court (ALC) affirmed.Â  Moragne appeals, arguing (1) he was\r\n  denied minimal and substantive due process by refusing to permit him to call\r\n  witnesses in his behalf; (2) he was denied minimal due process by suppressing\r\n  exculpatory evidence; (3) he was denied minimal due process by not being given\r\n  adequate assistance in preparing his defense before and during the hearing; (4)\r\n  the ALC erred in allowing a state prison guard to vouch for the veracity of the\r\n  inmate accuser's hearsay statement; and (5) the ALC erred in excluding Moragne\r\n  from a critical segment of his hearing, thereby denying him the right to\r\n  confront and question his accuser.Â  We affirm[1] pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and\r\n  the following authorities:Â  \r\n1.&nbsp; As to our standard of review for these issues:Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§&nbsp;1-23-610(B) (Supp. 2009) (confining review of a decision by the ALC\r\n  to the record and permitting this court to reverse or modify the ALC's ruling\r\n  if the appellant suffers prejudice to his substantive rights because the ALC's\r\n  decision violates constitutional or statutory provisions, exceeds the statutory\r\n  authority of the agency, is made upon unlawful procedure, suffers from another\r\n  error of law, is clearly erroneous in view of the whole record, or is arbitrary\r\n  or capricious or displays an abuse of discretion); Slezak v.

Bi-Lo, Inc., 276\r\n  S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981) (finding &quot;substantial\r\n  evidence&quot; not to be &quot;a mere scintilla of evidence nor the evidence\r\n  viewed blindly from one side of the case, but . . . evidence which, considering\r\n  the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion\r\n  that the administrative agency reached or must have reached in order to justify\r\n  its action&quot;); Corbin v.

McDonnell,\r\n  418 U.S. 539, 556 (1974) (holding due process invoked by a disciplinary charge\r\n  endangering an inmate's sentence-related or &quot;good time&quot; credits is restricted\r\n  due to incarceration but must accommodate both the inmate's Constitutional\r\n  rights and the needs and objectives of the penal institution); Al-Shabazz v.\r\n    State, 338 S.C. 354, 371-73, 527 S.E.2d 742, 751-52 (2000) (finding the\r\n  Department's procedures for conducting major disciplinary hearings, in which an\r\n  inmate's liberty interest is at stake, comport with the due process\r\n  requirements articulated in Wolff; recognizing an inmate's right to\r\n  present a defense at a disciplinary hearing, including documentary evidence and\r\n  witness testimony; but observing Department procedures require that disciplinary\r\n  hearing officer (DHO) preside over disciplinary hearing and record and justify\r\n  his rulings); State v.

Wukela, of Florence, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tE. LeRoy Nettles, Sr. and Marian D. Nettles, both of Lake City,\r\n  for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  Irby Ned Myron Lowder appeals the Special Referee's Order\r\n  recognizing a twenty-five foot wide easement across his property, arguing no\r\n  evidence existed in the record to support the Special Referee's factual finding.Â \r\n  We reverse and remand for further factual\r\n  findings because the Special Referee's finding was not supported by a\r\n  preponderance of the evidence.[1]\r\nLowder\r\n  and McKnight are brother and sister and adjacent landowners. Â The\r\n  easement at issue is a dirt road crossing Lowder's property that McKnight has\r\n  used for ingress and egress to her lot since 1974.Â  In February of 2007,\r\n  McKnight brought an action to recognize the existence of her easement for\r\n  ingress/egress and to enjoin Lowder from obstructing the easement. Â The\r\n  matter was heard by a Special Referee.Â  Prior to the hearing, Lowder and\r\n  McKnight both conceded the existence of the easement, but disputed the width of\r\n  the easement.\r\nDuring\r\n  the hearing, Lowder used visual scales on two separate county plats entered\r\n  into evidence to mathematically calculate the actual width of the dirt road at\r\n  9.375 feet.Â  McKnight's husband testified he and McKnight needed a twenty-five\r\n  foot wide easement to permit fire trucks and ambulances to access their mobile\r\n  home in the event of an emergency. Â McKnight's husband testified Lowder obstructed\r\n  their use of the dirt road by moving a trailer onto his land bordering the dirt\r\n  road and piling cut tree logs along the edge of the dirt road, thereby\r\n  narrowing the width of the dirt road to eleven feet.Â  The Special Referee\r\n  issued an order recognizing a twenty-five foot wide easement.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.Â  Â Â Â \r\n&quot;The\r\n  determination of the existence of an easement is a question of fact in a law\r\n  action . . . .&quot; Frazier v. Smallseed, 384 S.C. 56, 64, 682 S.E.2d\r\n  8, 12&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009) (citation omitted).Â  &quot;However, the\r\n  determination of the extent of a grant of an easement is an action in equity.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;In an action in equity, the appellate court may resolve\r\n  questions of fact in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.&quot;Â  Fesmire v. Digh, 385 S.C. 296, 303, 683 S.E.2d 803, 807\r\n  (Ct. App. 2009).Â  \r\n&quot;An\r\n  easement is a right of use over another's property.&quot;Â  Inlet Harbour v.\r\n    S.C. Dep't of Parks, Recreation, and Tourism, 377 S.C. 86, 91, 659 S.E.2d\r\n  151, 154 (2008).Â  &quot;Easements can arise by both express creation and by implication.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;Implied easements are based upon the theory that whenever one\r\n  conveys property, he intends to convey whatever is necessary for the property's\r\n  use and enjoyment.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;[T]he intentions of the parties to\r\n  the transaction are the overriding focus when examining implied\r\n  easements.&quot;Â  Id. at 92, 659 S.E.2d at 154.Â  \r\n&quot;The\r\n  right of the easement owner and the right of the landowner are not absolute,\r\n  irrelative and uncontrolled, but are so limited, each by the other, that there\r\n  may be a due and reasonable enjoyment of both.&quot;Â  Hill v. Carolina Power\r\n    &amp; Light Co., 204 S.C. 83, 96, 28 S.E.2d 545, 549 (1943).Â  &quot;In\r\n  other words, a grant or reservation of an easement in general terms is limited\r\n  to a use which is reasonably necessary and convenient and as little burdensome\r\n  to the servient estate as possible for the use contemplated.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nThe Special Referee's finding regarding the existence of an\r\n  easement has not been appealed and is therefore the law of the case.Â  See Dreher v. Dreher, 370 S.C. 75, 78 n.1, 634 S.E.2d 646, 647 n.1 (2006).Â \r\n  Therefore, the only factual finding on appeal is the scope or extent of the\r\n  easement.Â  Because the extent\r\n  or scope of an easement is an equity action, this court is free to resolve questions of fact in accordance with its own view of\r\n  the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Fesmire, 385 S.C. at 303, 683 S.E.2d\r\n  at 807.\r\nUpon thorough review of the Special Referee's factual findings, we\r\n  conclude the grant of a twenty-five foot wide easement was not supported by the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence. Â Specifically, the Special Referee erred in not taking into account the interests of\r\n  the servient estate when determining what easement width was both reasonably\r\n  necessary and convenient.Â  Although McKnight's\r\n  husband testified he wanted a twenty-five-foot wide easement, he also admitted\r\n  a seventeen-foot easement was sufficient for an ambulance or truck to reach the\r\n  couple's mobile home.Â  In addition, the creation of a twenty-five-foot wide\r\n  easement would require the McKnights to cut down trees which have been present\r\n  on the servient estate since 1985.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we reverse and remand for the Special Referee to consider the interests of both\r\n  the dominant and servient estate owners in determining what easement width is\r\n  both reasonably necessary and convenient.Â  See Hill, 204 S.C. at\r\n  96, 28 S.E.2d at 549.\r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nSHORT, THOMAS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-417","title":"Hamm v.

Wannamaker,\r\n  291 S.C. 518, 354 S.E.2d 555 (1987) does not require premium amounts for the\r\n  various options of UIM coverage limits to be included on the offer form to\r\n  constitute a meaningful offer; (2) Hamm's employer, NationsRent, Inc.,\r\n  understood the nature of UIM coverage and intended to reject the offer\r\n  regardless of the missing premiums on the form; and (3) the absence of the\r\n  premium amounts is irrelevant because the offer would have been rejected\r\n  regardless.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  Court granted Traveler's motion to hold the opinion in abeyance pending a\r\n  decision by the South Carolina Supreme Court in Grinnell Corp. v. Wood,\r\n  378 S.C. 458, 663 S.E.2d 61 (Ct. App. 2008).[1]Â \r\n  We reverse[2] pursuant to Rule 220(b)(2), SCACR, and the following authorities: Grinnell\r\n    Corp. v. Wood, Op. No. 26869 (S.C.

Hudgens, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Beverly\r\n  Hampton brought this negligence action against Lora Pfohl[1] after being involved in an automobile accident with Pfohl\r\n  on September 14, 2004, in Greenville County, South Carolina.Â  At trial,\r\n  immediately before the jury was charged, Hampton moved for a directed verdict\r\n  on the issues of duty and negligence.[2]Â  The circuit court denied the motion.Â  The jury subsequently\r\n  returned a verdict by checking &quot;no&quot; to the following question on the\r\n  verdict form: &quot;Do you find the defendant was negligent and that such\r\n  negligence proximately caused the plaintiff's injuries?&quot;Â  After the\r\n  verdict was rendered, Hampton moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict\r\n  (JNOV), a new trial absolute, and a new trial under the thirteenth juror\r\n  doctrine.Â  All of Hampton's post-trial motions were denied.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Hampton argues the circuit\r\n    court erred in (1) denying her motions for a directed verdict and JNOV; (2)\r\n    denying her motions for a new trial absolute and new trial under the thirteenth\r\n    juror doctrine; and (3) charging comparative fault.Â  We affirm.\r\n1.&nbsp; As to Hampton's argument that the\r\n  circuit court erred in denying her motions for a directed verdict and JNOV, we\r\n  find no reversible error.[3]Â  Rather, we conclude the jury's verdict must be\r\n  affirmed pursuant to the two-issue rule.Â  &quot;Under the two-issue rule, when\r\n  a jury returns a general verdict in a case involving two or more issues or\r\n  defenses, and the verdict is supported as to at least one issue or defense that\r\n  has been presented to the jury free from error, the verdict will not be\r\n  reversed.&quot;Â  Cole v. Raut, 378 S.C. 398, 406-07, 663 S.E.2d 30, 34\r\n  (2008).Â  Here, the evidence supports a finding that Hampton suffered no\r\n  injuries as a result of her accident with Pfohl and thus Pfohl's alleged\r\n  negligence did not proximately cause any damages to Hampton.[4] Â Therefore, because\r\n  the jury's verdict is supported as to at least one issue,[5] it must be upheld.Â  See Dropkin v. Beachwalk Villas Condo. Ass'n,\r\n  373 S.C. 360, 365, 644 S.E.2d 808, 810 (Ct. App. 2007) (&quot;Because there is\r\n  evidence to support the verdict on the issue of proximate cause, and the jury\r\n  returned a general verdict as to the issues of negligence and proximate cause,\r\n  we must uphold the verdict.&quot;).\r\n2.&nbsp; With respect to Hampton's\r\n  argument that the circuit court erred in denying her motions for a new trial\r\n  absolute and new trial under the thirteenth juror doctrine, we find no error.Â  &quot;The grant or denial of new trial motions rests within\r\n  the discretion of the circuit court and its decision will not be disturbed on\r\n  appeal unless its findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence or the\r\n  conclusions reached are controlled by error of law.&quot;Â  RRR, Inc. v.\r\n    Toggas, 378 S.C. 174, 182, 662 S.E.2d 438, 442 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  Here, as\r\n  discussed above, we find the evidence supports the conclusion that Hampton did\r\n  not suffer any damages as a result of her accident with Pfohl.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the circuit court did not err in denying Hampton's motions for a new trial absolute and new trial under the\r\n  thirteenth juror doctrine.\r\n3.&nbsp; Finally, regarding\r\n  Hampton's argument that the circuit court erred by charging comparative negligence,\r\n  we find no preserved error.Â  &quot;[A] party may not complain on appeal of\r\n  error or object to a trial procedure which his own conduct has induced.&quot; Â Erickson\r\n    v. Jones St. Publishers, LLC, 368 S.C. 444, 476, 629 S.E.2d 653, 670 (2006).Â \r\n  Here, Hampton asked the circuit court to use a comparative negligence verdict\r\n  form.Â  Therefore, Hampton cannot now argue the circuit court erred in instructing\r\n  the jury on comparative negligence.Â  \r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, the circuit court's decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.[6]\r\nKONDUROS,\r\n  GEATHERS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] According to\r\n  Pfohl's brief, her first name is &quot;Lora,&quot; not &quot;Laura&quot; as set\r\n  forth in the pleadings.Â  We order that the case caption be amended accordingly.\r\n[2] To state a\r\n  cause of action for negligence, the plaintiff must allege facts that\r\n  demonstrate the concurrence of three elements: (1) a duty of care owed by the\r\n  defendant; (2) a breach of that duty by negligent act or omission; and (3)\r\n  damage proximately caused by the breach.Â  Kleckley v. Nw. Nat'l Cas. Co.,\r\n  338 S.C. 131, 138, 526 S.E.2d 218, 221 (2000).\r\n[3] Because Hampton\r\n  did not move for a directed verdict at the close of all the evidence but rather\r\n  waited until after closing arguments were completed, we question whether this\r\n  issue is preserved for review on appeal.Â  See Rule 50, SCRCP note 2\r\n  (&quot;The motion for directed verdict may be made at the close of plaintiff's\r\n  evidence, as well as at the close of all the evidence.&quot;); Freeman v. A.\r\n    &amp; M. Mobile Home Sales, Inc., 293 S.C. 255, 258-59, 359 S.E.2d 532, 535\r\n  (Ct. App. 1987) (&quot;Before a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict\r\n  can properly be made, . . . a party must move for a directed verdict at the\r\n  close of all the evidence.&quot;); 88 C.J.S. Trial Â§ 442 (2001) (&quot;According\r\n  to some authority, it is too late to move for a directed verdict after the\r\n  beginning of argument, or after the close of the testimony and argument of both\r\n  parties, when reopening is wholly within the discretion of the court.&quot;\r\n  (footnotes omitted)). Â Nonetheless, as\r\n  discussed herein, even if this issue is preserved, we find the jury's verdict\r\n  must be affirmed.Â  \r\n[4] In her amended\r\n  complaint, Hampton alleged she suffered &quot;physical harm and injuries&quot;\r\n  and incurred medical expenses; she did not claim any damages relating to her\r\n  vehicle.Â  \r\n[5] The issue of\r\n  whether Hampton suffered any damages as a result of Pfohl's alleged\r\n  negligence was pertinent to the question of Pfohl's liability and thus was subsumed\r\n  in the verdict form's query, &quot;Do you find the defendant was negligent and\r\n  that such negligence proximately caused the plaintiff's injuries?&quot; Â See Stevens v. Allen, 342 S.C. 47, 52, 536 S.E.2d 663, 665 (2000) (holding\r\n  if the jury finds the plaintiff has failed to prove damages proximately caused\r\n  by the defendant's negligence, then it should render a verdict finding the\r\n  defendant not liable rather than award the plaintiff zero damages). Â \r\n[6] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR, and the parties'\r\n  agreement.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-419","title":"Lagroon v.

C. Buddy Nicholson, Jr., Circuit Court\r\n  Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2010-UP-419\r\nSubmitted September 1, 2010 â€“ Filed September 24,\r\n  2010Â Â Â  \r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tKenneth P. Woodington and Lynne W. Rogers, both of Columbia, for\r\n  Appellant.Â  \r\n\t\t\t\tRobert J. Lagroon, pro se, of McCormick, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: The\r\n  South Carolina State Board of Dentistry (Board) sanctioned Dr. Robert J.\r\n  Lagroon for certain acts of professional misconduct.Â  After the Administrative\r\n  Law Court (ALC) affirmed as modified the Board's decision,[1] the circuit court found the Board improperly held Dr.\r\n  Lagroon to the standard of an orthodontist and reversed the Board's one-year\r\n  suspension of his license.Â  On behalf of the Board, the South Carolina\r\n  Department of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation (Department) appeals, arguing\r\n  the suspension was within the Board's statutory authority and the Board did not\r\n  hold Dr. Lagroon to the standard of an orthodontist.Â  We reverse the circuit\r\n  court and reinstate the decision of the Board as modified by the ALC.[2]\r\nThe Administrative\r\n  Procedures Act governs appellate review of administrative decisions by the\r\n  Board.Â  Deese v. S.C. State Bd. of Dentistry, 286 S.C. 182, 184, 332\r\n  S.E.2d 539, 540-41 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  Appellate review &quot;must be confined to\r\n  the record.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(4) (Supp. 2009).Â  Furthermore:Â  \r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  court may not substitute its judgment for the judgment of the agency as to the\r\n  weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  The court may affirm the decision\r\n  of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings.Â  The court may\r\n  reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been\r\n  prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or\r\n  decisions are: \r\n\t(a) in\r\n  violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; \r\n\t(b) in\r\n  excess of the statutory authority of the agency; \r\n\t(c)\r\n  made upon unlawful procedure; \r\n\t(d)\r\n  affected by other error of law; \r\n\t(e)\r\n  clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence\r\n  on the whole record; or \r\n\t(f)\r\n  arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly\r\n  unwarranted exercise of discretion. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5)\r\n  (Supp. 2009).Â  &quot;A decision is arbitrary if it is without a rational basis,\r\n  is based alone on one's will and not upon any course of reasoning and exercise\r\n  of judgment, is made at pleasure, without adequate determining principles, or\r\n  is governed by no fixed rules or standards.&quot;Â  Deese, 286 S.C. at\r\n  184-85, 332 S.E.2d at 541.Â  \r\n1.&nbsp; First,\r\n  the Department asserts the circuit court\r\n  erred in finding the Board held Dr. Lagroon to the standard of an\r\n  orthodontist.Â  We agree.Â  \r\n\r\n\tA\r\n  person engages in the practice of dentistry when he charges a fee to:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t[E]xtract\r\n  teeth, correct malpositions of the teeth or jaws, or take impressions, or\r\n  construct, supply, repair, reline, or duplicate artificial teeth as substitutes\r\n  for natural teeth, or adjust such substitutes, . . . or . . . use X ray for\r\n  dental treatment or dental diagnostic purposes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  40-15-70(2)(b) (2001).Â  When the Board receives a complaint against a licensed\r\n  dentist, it must investigate the allegations and, in its discretion, may file a\r\n  formal accusation charging the dentist with a violation of the statutes\r\n  governing those who practice dentistry.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-15-180(1) (2001).Â \r\n  Generally, the Board may discipline a dentist who:\r\n\r\n\t(f) has committed a dishonorable, unethical, or\r\n  unprofessional act that is likely to deceive, defraud, or harm the public; \r\n\t(g) lacks the professional or ethical competence to\r\n  practice the profession or occupation; \r\n\t* * *\r\n\t(k) violates a provision of this article or of a\r\n  regulation promulgated under this article; [or]\r\n\t(l) violates the code of professional ethics adopted\r\n  by the applicable licensing board for the regulated profession or occupation or\r\n  adopted by the department with the advice of the advisory panel for the\r\n  professions and occupations it directly regulates. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-1-110\r\n  (2001).Â  Specifically, the Board may discipline a dentist who &quot;has\r\n  employed or permitted an unlicensed or unregistered person to practice\r\n  dentistry or dental hygiene&quot; or who &quot;has failed to meet the standards\r\n  of care in the practice of dentistry or dental hygiene or the performance of\r\n  dental technological work.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§&nbsp;40-15-190(4) &amp; (14)\r\n  (2001).Â  The regulation governing the ethical and professional conduct of\r\n  dentists in South Carolina states that &quot;[t]he dentist's primary obligation\r\n  of service to the public shall include the delivery of quality care,\r\n  competently and timely, within the bounds of the clinical circumstances presented\r\n  by the patient. Â Quality of care shall be a primary consideration of the dental\r\n  practitioner.&quot;Â  23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 39-11 (1983).Â  This regulation\r\n  also obligates dentists to &quot;maintain patient records in a manner\r\n  consistent with the protection of the welfare of the patient.Â  Upon request of\r\n  a patient or another dental practitioner, dentists shall provide any\r\n  information that will be beneficial for the future treatment of that\r\n  patient.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  treating their patients, medical professionals must &quot;exercise that degree\r\n  of care and skill which is ordinarily employed by the profession generally,\r\n  under similar conditions and in like surrounding circumstances.&quot;Â  Jernigan\r\n    v. King, 312 S.C. 331, 333, 440 S.E.2d 379, 381 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  In an\r\n  action for medical malpractice, a physician's departure from the standard of\r\n  care is established by presentation of two types of evidence:Â  (1)\r\n  &quot;evidence of the generally recognized practices and procedures which would\r\n  be exercised by competent practitioners in a defendant doctor's field of\r\n  medicine under the same or similar circumstances&quot; and (2) &quot;evidence\r\n  that the defendant doctor departed from the recognized and generally accepted\r\n  standards, practices and procedures in the manner alleged by the plaintiff.&quot;Â  Cox v. Lund, 286 S.C. 410, 414, 334 S.E.2d 116, 118 (1985).Â  \r\nBoth\r\n  general practitioners licensed in other states and specialists may be qualified\r\n  to testify to the appropriate standard of care for a general practitioner in\r\n  South Carolina.Â  Burroughs v. Worsham, 352 S.C. 382, 403-04, 574 S.E.2d\r\n  215, 226 (Ct. App. 2002) (finding an internist, a colorectal surgeon, and an\r\n  Illinois-licensed family practitioner qualified to testify to the standard of\r\n  care for a South Carolina family practitioner); see also King v.\r\n    Williams, 276 S.C. 478, 482, 279 S.E.2d 618, 620 (1981) (&quot;No longer is\r\n  it proper to limit the definition of the standard of care which a medical\r\n  doctor or dentist must meet solely to the practice or custom of a particular\r\n  locality, a similar locality, or a geographic area.&quot;) (internal citation\r\n  omitted).Â  \r\nWe\r\n  reverse the circuit court's decision and reinstate the decision of the Board as\r\n  modified by the ALC because the record does not support the circuit court's\r\n  finding that the Board held Dr. Lagroon to the standard of an orthodontist.Â  A\r\n  specialist in a medical profession may testify to the standards applicable to\r\n  general practitioners.Â  Burroughs, 352 S.C. at 403-04, 574 S.E.2d at\r\n  226.Â  The record reflects that Dr. Tompkins identified himself as a dentist at\r\n  the commencement of his testimony and that he was licensed as a dentist in\r\n  South Carolina prior to becoming an orthodontist.Â  He formed his opinion in\r\n  this case after reviewing records from both Dr. Lagroon, a dentist, and Dr.\r\n  Fulmer, an orthodontist.Â  Furthermore, Dr. Tompkins unequivocally stated Dr.\r\n  Lagroon did not meet the standard of care applicable to &quot;a licensed general\r\n  dentist providing orthodontic services.&quot;Â  \r\nIn evaluating\r\n  Dr. Lagroon's treatment of Patient, Dr. Tompkins addressed the standards\r\n  applicable to dentists in four aspects of treatment:Â  assessment, planning, patient\r\n  education, and documentation.Â  See Cox, 286 S.C. at 414, 334\r\n  S.E.2d at 118 (explaining a physician's departure from the standard of care may\r\n  be established by articulation of practices and procedures employed by\r\n  competent practitioners and evidence of the physician's departure from those\r\n  norms).Â  First, with regard to assessment of a patient's needs, Dr. Tompkins\r\n  stated, &quot;[Y]ou'd start off with an evaluation of what you've got now.Â \r\n  What is it now.Â  Where am I now and where have we got to go.&quot;Â  Second,\r\n  having established a starting point and projected an ending point, he indicated\r\n  the dentist must develop a treatment plan and demonstrate good judgment in\r\n  determining whether he possesses the requisite skills and training to execute\r\n  it.Â  According to Dr. Tompkins, a practitioner who does not recognize his\r\n  limitations can &quot;get in trouble.&quot;Â  Third, Dr. Tompkins stated the\r\n  professional must educate his patient:Â  &quot;[y]ou have to tell the patient\r\n  what they need. . . . And then you try to educate them so that they will make\r\n  the right decision and decide the treatment.&quot;Â  Finally, Dr. Tompkins\r\n  expected a dentist to record his findings and the patient's progress.[3]Â  \r\nDr.\r\n  Tompkins took issue with Dr. Lagroon's planning and documentation of Patient's\r\n  treatment, which he classified as a case of medium difficulty for an\r\n  orthodontist.Â  With regard to planning, Dr. Tompkins stated Patient's case\r\n  &quot;turned out to be a very bad situation in an untrained person's\r\n  hands.&quot;Â  Although Dr. Lagroon treated Patient's midline issue and planned\r\n  to replace the missing and malformed teeth and reduce the overjet, his\r\n  treatment did not address the malocclusion.Â  After reviewing Dr. Lagroon's and\r\n  Dr. Fulmer's records, Dr. Tompkins determined the effects of Dr. Lagroon's\r\n  treatment were mixed.Â  According to Dr. Fulmer's records, Patient's midline was\r\n  relocated to its proper place.Â  However, Dr. Tompkins testified the\r\n  configuration of Patient's upper braces would have increased, rather than\r\n  decreased, the severity of the overjet.Â  With regard to a purported\r\n  one-millimeter decrease in Patient's overjet, Dr. Tompkins stated,\r\n  &quot;[T]hat's impossible.Â  It just can't happen.&quot;Â  Moreover, Dr. Tompkins\r\n  saw no reason for Patient to have braces on his bottom teeth.Â  He believed\r\n  Patient's cross bite resulted from Dr. Lagroon's placement and management of\r\n  Patient's braces.Â  Although Dr. Lagroon never took any impressions from which\r\n  models could be created, Dr. Tompkins testified a dentist would need a mounted\r\n  set of models to determine whether a particular treatment will improve or\r\n  worsen a patient's bite.Â  \r\nUpon\r\n  examination, Dr. Tompkins repeatedly complained that the records Dr. Lagroon\r\n  produced in response to the Board's subpoena failed to document Patient's\r\n  condition and omitted important information.Â  Dr. Tompkins found no evaluation\r\n  of Patient's teeth at the initial presentation, no indication of Patient's\r\n  complaints, no reference to a malocclusion, no examination findings requiring\r\n  braces, and confusing references to upper and lower braces and extraction of\r\n  tooth 7.Â  &quot;There is nothing here about deep bite, open bite, cross bite,\r\n  [or] protrusion[;] there is nothing in here that would give me any clues as to\r\n  what the problems were and why the braces were put on.&quot;Â  Consequently, he\r\n  testified, the records had no value in determining Patient's prognosis.Â Â Â  \r\nWith\r\n  regard to Patient's care, the Board concluded Dr. Lagroon violated Section\r\n  40-1-110(f), (g), (k), and (l), as well as Reg. 39-11(1)(B).Â  The Board agreed\r\n  with Dr. Tompkins's view that Dr. Lagroon failed to plan adequately for\r\n  Patient's care by failing to prepare essential diagnostic models to assist him\r\n  in formulating a treatment plan and by failing to recognize Patient's\r\n  orthodontic needs exceeded his own abilities and training as a practitioner.Â \r\n  The Board found that because Dr. Lagroon lacked adequate training to treat\r\n  Patient, &quot;[t]he course of this case was more adverse to the patient than\r\n  it should have been.&quot;Â  Dr. Lagroon's documentation failures were more\r\n  pervasive, occurring at both the assessment and planning stages of treatment.Â \r\n  The Board recognized Dr. Lagroon provided no documentation of Patient's dental\r\n  condition prior to commencing treatment, no prognosis or diagnosis, no\r\n  treatment plan or goals, and no valid purpose for the braces on Patient's lower\r\n  teeth.Â  Consequently, the record supports the Board's findings and decision\r\n  regarding Dr. Lagroon's failure to render adequate care to Patient, and the\r\n  circuit court erred in reversing this decision.\r\n2.&nbsp; Next,\r\n  the Department asserts the circuit court erred in striking part of the sanction\r\n  imposed on Dr. Lagroon, because the sanction was well within the Board's\r\n  statutory authority.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nUpon\r\n  finding the dentist guilty of an offense charged in the formal accusation, the\r\n  Board may revoke or suspend the dentist's license, reprimand the dentist\r\n  publicly or privately, &quot;or take other reasonable action short of\r\n  revocation or suspension including, but not limited to, probation or requiring\r\n  the person to undertake additional professional training subject to the\r\n  direction and approval of the [B]oard, . . . and other actions considered\r\n  appropriate by the board.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-15-200 (2001).Â  In\r\n  addition, the Board &quot;may require the licensee or registrant to pay a civil\r\n  penalty of up to ten thousand dollars and the costs of the disciplinary\r\n  action.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn a\r\n  professional licensing disciplinary matter, imposition of sanctions specified\r\n  by the authorizing statute for a violation alleged in the formal accusation is\r\n  not arbitrary or capricious.Â  Deese v. S.C. State Bd. of Dentistry, 286\r\n  S.C. 182, 185, 332 S.E.2d 539, 541 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  In such matters, the\r\n  courts will not require a specific sanction for a particular violation when the\r\n  statute authorizing a professional board to impose certain sanctions does not\r\n  do so.Â  Gale v. State Bd. of Med. Examiners of S.C., 282 S.C. 474, 479, 20\r\n  S.E.2d 35, 38 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\nWe\r\n  reverse the circuit court's decision and reinstate the Board's one-year\r\n  suspension of Dr. Lagroon's license.Â  The circuit court's order ties its\r\n  reversal of this sanction to its finding that the Board improperly held Dr.\r\n  Lagroon to the standard of an orthodontist.[4]Â \r\n  In finding the Board applied the correct standard of care, we eradicate the\r\n  basis for the circuit court's reversal of the one-year suspension.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  we note the record does not support the circuit court's finding that the\r\n  Board's decision was arbitrary and capricious.Â  Rather, the Board's order\r\n  reflects careful consideration of the evidence presented, sound analysis of Dr.\r\n  Lagroon's records and testimony in light of Dr. Tompkins's expert testimony,\r\n  and appropriate sanctions aimed at improving the professional services Dr.\r\n  Lagroon offered.Â  Cf. Deese, 286 S.C. at 184-85, 332 S.E.2d at\r\n  541 (holding an arbitrary decision is one that is &quot;without a rational\r\n  basis, is based alone on one's will and not upon any course of reasoning and\r\n  exercise of judgment, is made at pleasure, without adequate determining\r\n  principles, or is governed by no fixed rules or standards&quot;).Â  After\r\n  finding Dr. Lagroon had permitted an unlicensed person to practice dental\r\n  hygiene in his office and had provided Patient with substandard care in the areas\r\n  of planning and recording treatment, the Board imposed two-stage sanctions.Â  In\r\n  the first stage, the Board suspended Dr. Lagroon's license for one year but\r\n  provided Dr. Lagroon with the option of avoiding suspension by paying a\r\n  ten-thousand-dollar fine.Â  In the second stage, the Board placed Dr. Lagroon on\r\n  probation for five years, required him to complete courses in ethics and\r\n  recordkeeping, and subjected him to heightened monitoring and reporting\r\n  requirements during the probationary period.Â  The Board's order conveys an\r\n  intimate understanding of Dr. Lagroon's violations, and the sanctions therein\r\n  indicate the Board intended to ensure Dr. Lagroon improved his practices before\r\n  taking on additional orthodontic patients.Â  Consequently, the circuit court erred\r\n  in reversing the suspension of Dr. Lagroon's license.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHUFF\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The ALC struck that portion of the Board's decision\r\n  that found Dr. Lagroon guilty of violating Section 40-15-212 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (2001), which establishes criminal penalties for aiding or\r\n  abetting a person in the unlawful practice of dentistry or dental hygiene.Â  \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3] This requirement corresponds to Reg. 39-11(1)(B),\r\n  which requires dentists to maintain patient records in a manner consistent with\r\n  the patient's welfare and to produce upon request &quot;any information that\r\n  will be beneficial for the future treatment of that patient.&quot;\r\n[4] Presumably, the circuit court did not reverse all the\r\n  Board's sanctions because the Board's finding that Dr. Lagroon permitted\r\n  Assistant's unauthorized practice of dental hygiene remained intact.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-420","title":"State v.

(Mother) appeals from the family court's order terminating her parental\r\n  rights to her minor children (Children).Â  Mother argues the family court erred in terminating her parental rights because she willfully\r\n  failed to support Children and Children were in foster care for fifteen of the\r\n  most recent twenty-two months.Â  Mother also appeals the family court's finding termination of parental rights\r\n  (TPR) was in Children's best interests.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n1.Â  We affirm the\r\n  family court's finding Children resided in foster care, under the\r\n  responsibility of the state, for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570 (2010)\r\n  (stating the family court may order TPR upon finding one or more of eleven\r\n  statutory grounds is satisfied and also finding TPR is in the best interest of\r\n  the child); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570(8) (2010) (explaining one statutory\r\n  ground for TPR is met when &quot;[t]he child has been in foster care under the\r\n  responsibility of the State for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months&quot;); Charleston County Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Jackson, 368 S.C. 87, 101-02,\r\n  627 S.E.2d 765, 773 (Ct. App. 2006) (noting the purpose of this statutory\r\n  ground &quot;is to ensure that children do not languish in foster care when\r\n  termination of parental rights would be in their best interests&quot;); Id. at 101, 627 S.E.2d at 773&nbsp;(noting a finding pursuant to section\r\n  63-7-2570(8) alone is sufficient to support a termination of parental rights). \r\n  \r\n  2. We affirm the family\r\n  court's finding Mother willfully failed to support Children.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570(4) (2010) (explaining another statutory ground is met\r\n  when a child has lived outside the home for a period of six months and during\r\n  that time the parent willfully failed to support the child); Id. (&quot;Failure\r\n  to support means that the parent has failed to make a material contribution to\r\n  the child's care.Â  A material contribution consists of either financial\r\n  contributions according to the parent's means or contributions of food,\r\n  clothing, shelter, or other necessities for the care of the child according to\r\n  the parent's means. The court may consider all relevant circumstances in\r\n  determining whether or not the parent has wil[l]fully failed to support the\r\n  child, including requests for support by the custodian and the ability of the\r\n  parent to provide support.&quot;); S.C.

Despite Mother's\r\n  arguments to the contrary, we find the Department of Social Services (DSS)\r\n  proved by clear and convincing evidence that termination of Mother's parental\r\n  rights was in the best interests of Children.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann.

(A-Team), a business\r\n  owned by Lamb's ex-husband, Charles Stundzia.Â  The agreement provided for a\r\n  $5,000 requested credit limit, with the balance due by the tenth of the month\r\n  for a two percent discount and due within thirty days of billing to prevent\r\n  default.Â  Any unpaid portion of the balance after thirty days would be subject\r\n  to a 1.5% service charge.Â  The agreement also provided for the payment of\r\n  reasonable attorney's fees, consisting of fifteen percent of the balance due,\r\n  plus all costs.Â  Finally, the agreement contained the following provision:\r\n  &quot;Customer will be notified by Glidden if Customer is approved for credit\r\n  and at what credit limit.Â  Glidden expressly reserves the right, at any time,\r\n  for any reason, to cancel the right to purchase on credit in the future.&quot;Â  \r\nUnderneath the signature line\r\n  in the credit and sales agreement is a personal guarantee signed by Stundzia\r\n  and Lamb:\r\n\r\nPERSONAL GUARANTEE\r\n\r\n  In\r\n    consideration of the extension of credit to the above Customer, I/we personally\r\n    and individually guarantee payment of any and all future or current indebtedness,\r\n    including costs and attorney's fees on demand.Â  This guarantee will remain in\r\n    full force and effect as to new purchases until written notice of its\r\n    termination is received by Hilton Head Glidden/Beaufort Glidden, Attn: David\r\n    Harter, 13 New Orleans Road, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina 29928.\r\n\r\nGlidden initiated the present\r\n  action by filing a nonjury complaint to collect a debt arising out of the\r\n  account from A-Team, Stundzia, and Lamb.[2]Â \r\n  Lamb answered the complaint and filed counterclaims for contract termination\r\n  and contract modification.Â  Glidden subsequently filed a motion for summary\r\n  judgment.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Glidden after a\r\n  hearing and awarded Glidden $13,330.58 for breach of contract, plus $6,198.71\r\n  for prejudgment interest accrued through February 1, 2008.Â  The court also\r\n  awarded $2,929.39 in attorney's fees, which is one third of the amount awarded\r\n  in principal and interest, for a total judgment of $22,458.68.Â  Lamb filed a motion\r\n  to alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, which was denied.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a\r\n  motion for summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard that\r\n  governs the trial court.Â  Wogan v. Kunze, 379 S.C. 581, 585, 666 S.E.2d\r\n  901, 903 (2008).Â  Summary judgment is proper when no genuine issue exists as to\r\n  any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\r\n  law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  &quot;On appeal from an order granting summary\r\n  judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and\r\n  inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the [nonmoving]\r\n  party below.&quot;Â  USAA Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Clegg, 377 S.C.\r\n  643, 653, 661 S.E.2d 791, 796 (2008).Â  &quot;[I]n cases applying the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence burden of proof, the [nonmoving] party is only\r\n  required to submit a mere scintilla of evidence in order to withstand a motion\r\n  for summary judgment.&quot;Â  Hancock v. Mid-South Mgmt. Co., 381 S.C.\r\n  326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803 (2009).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe sole issue on appeal is\r\n  whether summary judgment was appropriate.Â  Lamb asserts the existence of an\r\n  ambiguity creating a question of fact precluding summary judgment because the\r\n  credit and sales agreement secured by her personal guarantee did not provide\r\n  for the creation of debt greater than $5,000.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs a preliminary issue, the\r\n  trial court found that Lamb signed the agreement as a personal guarantor.Â  Lamb\r\n  argued before the trial court that she executed the credit and sales agreement\r\n  on behalf of her husband's business.Â  However, Lamb claimed she did not\r\n  intentionally sign a personal guarantee when she printed her name on the\r\n  signature line for the credit and sales agreement and signed her name\r\n  underneath the personal guarantee section.Â  The trial court dismissed this\r\n  argument and concluded Lamb's admission that she signed the document, which\r\n  clearly stated in bold capital letters &quot;PERSONAL GUARANTEE,&quot; supports\r\n  her status a personal guarantor on the note.Â  Lamb abandoned this argument on\r\n  appeal, asserting only that her personal guarantee is limited to $5,000.Â \r\n  &quot;[A]n 'unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case and\r\n  requires affirmance.'&quot;Â  Jones v. Lott, 387 S.C. 339, 346, 692\r\n  S.E.2d 900, 903 (2010) (quoting First Union Nat'l Bank of S.C. v. Soden,\r\n  333 S.C. 554, 566, 511 S.E.2d 372, 378 (Ct. App. 1998)).Â  Therefore, we affirm\r\n  the finding that Lamb is a personal guarantor of the credit and sales\r\n  agreement.\r\nAccordingly, we next consider\r\n  whether a dispute exists as to Lamb's personal liability for any debt greater\r\n  than $5,000.Â  Whether the language of a contract is ambiguous is a question of\r\n  law.Â  S.C. Dep't of Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C.\r\n  617, 623, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302-03 (2001).Â  The construction of an ambiguous\r\n  contract is a question of fact.Â  Skull Creek Club Ltd. P'ship v. Cook &amp;\r\n    Book, Inc., 313 S.C. 283, 286, 437 S.E.2d 163, 165 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  An\r\n  ambiguous written agreement is one that is capable of being understood in more\r\n  than one way, or is an agreement unclear in meaning because it expresses its\r\n  purpose in an indefinite manner.Â  Klutts Resort Realty, Inc. v. Down'Round\r\n    Dev. Corp., 268 S.C. 80, 89, 232 S.E.2d 20, 25 (1977).Â  &quot;Where the language\r\n  of a contract is plain and capable of legal construction, that language alone\r\n  determines the instrument's force and effect.&quot;Â  Jordan v. Sec. Group,\r\n    Inc., 311 S.C. 227, 230, 428 S.E.2d 705, 707 (1993).Â  Summary judgment is\r\n  not proper when there is a question as to the construction of a written\r\n  contract and the contract is ambiguous because the intent of the parties cannot\r\n  be ascertained from the four corners of the agreement.Â  HK New Plan Exch.\r\n    Prop. Owner I, LLC v. Coker, 375 S.C. 18, 23, 649 S.E.2d 181, 184 (Ct. App.\r\n  2007).Â  \r\nA guarantee is a contract.Â  TranSouth\r\n  Fin. Corp. v. Cochran, 324 S.C. 290, 294, 478 S.E.2d 63, 65 (Ct. App.\r\n  1996).Â  A note and guarantee are two separate contracts.Â  First Sav. Bank,\r\n    FSB v. Capital Investors, 318 S.C. 555, 557, 459 S.E.2d 307, 308 (1995).Â Â Â \r\n  However, &quot;[t]he general rule is that, in the absence of anything\r\n  indicating a contrary intention, where instruments are executed at the same\r\n  time, by the same parties, for the same purpose, and in the course of the same\r\n  transaction, the courts will consider and construe the instruments\r\n  together.&quot;Â  Klutts, 268 S.C. at 88, 232 S.E.2d at 24.Â  &quot;Construing\r\n  contemporaneous instruments together means simply that if there are any\r\n  provisions in one instrument limiting, explaining, or otherwise affecting the\r\n  provisions of another, they will be given effect between the parties so that\r\n  the whole agreement as actually made may be effectuated.&quot;Â  Id. at\r\n  88-89, 232 S.E.2d at 24.Â  Conversely, when the terms of a written guarantee\r\n  agreement are clear and complete, extrinsic evidence of agreements or\r\n  understandings contemporaneous with or prior to its execution cannot be used to\r\n  contradict, explain, or vary its terms.Â  Pee Dee State Bank v. Nat'l Fiber\r\n    Corp., 287 S.C. 640, 643, 340 S.E.2d 569, 570-71 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  \r\nIn the present matter, the\r\n  personal guarantee provides that Lamb is individually responsible for &quot;any\r\n  and all future or current indebtedness.&quot;Â  The guarantee also indicates it\r\n  is &quot;in consideration of the extension of credit to the above\r\n  Customer,&quot; referencing the credit and sales agreement that is located in\r\n  the same document, directly preceding the personal guarantee.Â  Even though a\r\n  guarantee is considered to be a separate contract, both the credit and sales\r\n  agreement and the guarantee were executed at the same time, by the same\r\n  parties, for the same purpose, and in the course of the same transaction.Â  See First Sav. Bank, 318 S.C. at 557, 459 S.E.2d at 308; Klutts, 268\r\n  S.C. at 88, 232 S.E.2d at 24.Â  Further, the guarantee references the credit and\r\n  sales agreement, which supports the inference that the two documents are to be\r\n  read together.\r\nIn Pee Dee State Bank,\r\n  the court of appeals scrutinized a guarantee executed as security for an\r\n  $85,000 loan to a corporation.Â  287 S.C. at 641, 340 S.E.2d at 570.Â  The loan\r\n  was secured by the personal guarantees of two of its officers.Â  Id.Â \r\n  After the corporation repaid the first loan, the bank loaned another $85,000,\r\n  which was never repaid.Â  Id.Â  One officer contested his liability for\r\n  the second loan, claiming his personal guarantee was only for the first loan.Â  Id. at 642, 340 S.E.2d at 570.Â  The court found the guarantee, entitled\r\n  &quot;UNCONDITIONAL CONTINUING PERSONAL GUARANTY&quot; in all caps, was plain\r\n  on its face and not limited to the initial loan.Â  Id. at 642, 340 S.E.2d\r\n  at 570.Â  \r\nNotwithstanding, Pee Dee\r\n  State Bank is reconcilable with the rule of construing related documents\r\n  together enunciated in Klutts, which has been cited frequently in this\r\n  state.Â  See, e.g., Cafe Assocs. v. Gerngross, 305 S.C. 6, 10, 406\r\n  S.E.2d 162, 164 (1991); Sentry Eng'g &amp; Constr., Inc. v. Mariner's Cay\r\n    Dev. Corp., 287 S.C. 346, 350, 338 S.E.2d 631, 633 (1985); Wilbur Smith\r\n      &amp; Assocs. v. Nat'l Bank of S.C., 274 S.C. 296, 299, 263 S.E.2d 643, 645\r\n  (1980); Ecclesiastes Prod. Ministries v. Outparcel Assocs., 374 S.C.\r\n  483, 498-99, 649 S.E.2d 494, 502 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  The guarantee in Pee Dee\r\n    State Bank was, by its terms, a continuing guarantee for full payment of\r\n  all debts &quot;whether now owing or due, or which may hereafter, from time to\r\n  time, be owing or due, and howsoever heretofore or hereafter created. . .\r\n  .&quot;Â  Pee Dee State Bank, 287 S.C. at 642, 340 S.E.2d at 570.Â  The\r\n  court refused to consider extrinsic evidence of agreements or understandings\r\n  contemporaneous with, or prior to, its execution to explain the terms in the\r\n  guarantee because the guarantee was clear and complete on its own.Â  Id. at 643, 340 S.E.2d at 570-71.Â  However, as indicated, the guarantee signed by\r\n  Lamb in this case&nbsp;is contained within the same document as the credit and\r\n  sales agreement with the requested $5,000 credit limitation;&nbsp;at&nbsp;a\r\n  minimum, for summary judgment purposes, this fact distinguishes this case from\r\n  the&nbsp;unconditional guarantee found&nbsp;in Pee Dee State Bank in\r\n  which no such additional fact raised a question as to the intent of the\r\n  parties.&nbsp;\r\nFurther, although not\r\n  discussed, the indication that the guarantee in Pee Dee State Bank was\r\n  unconditional and continuing could be interpreted as a contrary intention that\r\n  the guarantee should not be considered together with the other\r\n  contemporaneously executed documents.Â  Cf. Klutts, 268 S.C. at\r\n  88, 232 S.E.2d at 24 (construing instruments executed at the same time together\r\n  &quot;in the absence of anything indicating a contrary intention&quot;).Â  In\r\n  the instant case, the personal guarantee included at the bottom of the two-page\r\n  credit and sales agreement does not contain any indication it should not be\r\n  read together with the credit and sales agreement; in fact, the guarantee\r\n  references the credit and sales agreement by referring to the above customer.Â  \r\nUltimately, if the documents\r\n  are construed together, there is more than one inference that may be drawn\r\n  therefrom.Â  Glidden views the terms of the guarantee as insuring payment of\r\n  &quot;all future and current indebtedness.&quot;Â  Lamb, on the other hand,\r\n  submitted an affidavit averring she read the agreement as a whole and believed\r\n  she was only guaranteeing a credit limit up to $5,000.Â  Therefore, because at\r\n  least a mere scintilla of evidence supports Lamb's position, we reverse the\r\n  grant of summary judgment and the award of damages.Â  See USAA Prop.\r\n    &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Clegg, 377 S.C. 643, 653, 661 S.E.2d 791, 796 (2008); Hancock v. Mid-South Mgmt. Co., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803\r\n  (2009).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we\r\n  affirm the finding that Lamb is a personal guarantor of the credit and sales\r\n  agreement.Â  However, we reverse the grant of summary judgment on the disputed\r\n  issue of whether Lamb's guarantee extends beyond the requested credit limit and\r\n  remand this issue for trial.Â  Accordingly, the order of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED\r\n  IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nWILLIAMS, PIEPER, and\r\n  KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n[2] A-Team and Stundzia are not parties to the present\r\n  appeal.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
