Keesley, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-063\r\n  Submitted January 12, 2004 â€“ Filed February \r\n  4, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Brian Austin Katonak, of Aiken, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n          General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, \r\n          Assistant Attorney General Deborah R. J. Shupe, all of Columbia; and Solicitor \r\n          Barbara R. Morgan, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Morris Tyler was convicted \r\n  of four counts of second-degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC) with a minor.Â  \r\n  On appeal, he asserts the circuit court erred in quashing a subpoena he served \r\n  on the Department of Social Services (DSS) and in failing to grant his motion \r\n  for a directed verdict.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn May 2001, Tyler was indicted on four charges \r\n  of second-degree CSC with a minor occurring in August and November 2000.Â  The \r\n  victim of these crimes was a family member (â€œthe victimâ€).Â  As part of his defense, \r\n  Tyler issued a subpoena to DSS seeking â€œall documents and recordsâ€ regarding \r\n  the victim.Â  DSS moved to quash the subpoena, contending disclosure of the requested \r\n  records was prohibited under South Carolina law.Â  \r\nDuring a hearing on the matter on January 11, 2002, \r\n  DSS informed the circuit court that the only file regarding the victim was opened \r\n  against the victimâ€™s mother for possible neglect, but it was determined to be \r\n  a Category I â€œunfoundedâ€ case.Â  DSS also indicated that, but for agency delay, \r\n  the file already would have been destroyed in accordance with statutory procedures.Â  \r\n  The circuit court quashed the subpoena, ruling the applicable statutes barred \r\n  disclosure of the records because Tyler was not the subject of the DSS investigation.Â  \r\nA jury trial was subsequently held on the four \r\n  CSC counts.Â  Tyler was convicted as charged and sentenced to life in prison \r\n  without parole.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Subpoena for DSS File\r\nTyler contends the circuit court erred in quashing \r\n  the subpoena because he was entitled to the DSS file even if he was not the \r\n  subject of the investigation; moreover, he asserts the courtâ€™s failure to conduct \r\n  an in camera review of the file violated his due process rights.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe South Carolina Code sets forth procedures for \r\n  handling reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. [1] Â  Section 20-7-650 requires DSS \r\n  to investigate a report of suspected child abuse or neglect to determine whether \r\n  the report is â€œindicatedâ€ or â€œunfounded.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-650(C) (Supp. \r\n  2001).Â  All â€œunfoundedâ€ cases must be classified as either Category I, II, or \r\n  III.Â  Id. Â§ 20-7-650(G).Â  Category I represents unfounded reports â€œin \r\n  which abuse and neglect were ruled out following the investigation.â€Â  Id. Â§ 20-7-650(G)(1).Â  \r\nThe file that Tyler wanted was determined to be \r\n  a Category I unfounded report, the disclosure of which is governed by section \r\n  20-7-695, which provides in relevant part as follows:\r\n(B)Â  The alleged perpetrator in an unfounded report who \r\n  has reason to believe that the report was made maliciously or in bad faith has \r\n  the right to request in writing that records of the report be retained by \r\n  the department for up to two years from the date of the case decision.Â  The \r\n  written request must be received by the department within thirty days of the \r\n  personâ€™s receiving notice of the case decision.Â  A person exercising this \r\n  right may request a copy of the record of the unfounded case and the department \r\n  shall provide a copy of the record . . . .\r\n. . . .\r\n(D)Â  An alleged perpetrator in an unfounded case who \r\n  believes the report was made maliciously or in bad faith may petition the family \r\n  court to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the reporter \r\n  acted maliciously or in bad faith.Â  The court shall determine probable cause \r\n  based on an in camera review of the case record and oral or written argument, \r\n  or both.Â  If the court finds probable cause, the identity of the reporter \r\n  must be disclosed to the moving party.\r\n(E)Â  Notwithstanding other provisions of the law affecting \r\n  confidentiality of child protective services records and use and disclosure \r\n  of records of unfounded cases, a court conducting civil or criminal proceedings \r\n  resulting from disclosures authorized by this section may order the department \r\n  to release the record to any party to the case or to law enforcement.\r\nId. Â§ 20-7-695 (emphasis added).\r\nBased on the foregoing, it is clear that the file \r\n  of an unfounded report may be released only to the alleged perpetrator who is \r\n  the subject of the investigation.Â  In this case, the subject of the investigation \r\n  was the victimâ€™s mother, not Tyler.Â  Thus, in the absence of a written request \r\n  from her, the file could not be disclosed.Â  An in camera review \r\n  of the report by the family court would have been necessary only if the subject \r\n  of the report had timely sought a determination of probable cause.Â  See id. Â§ 20-7-695(D).Â  \r\nFurther, Tyler is not entitled to the \r\n  file under section 20-7-695(E) because the criminal proceeding against him did \r\n  not result â€œfrom disclosures authorized by this section.â€Â  Rather, the criminal \r\n  charges resulted from law enforcementâ€™s investigation of his conduct.Â  The proceedings \r\n  referred to in section 20-7-695(E) concern those initiated by the subject of \r\n  an unfounded report who believes the original report was made maliciously or \r\n  in bad faith.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in quashing the subpoena.\r\nII.Â  Directed Verdict\r\nTyler next contends the circuit court \r\n  erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict.Â  We disagree.\r\nA defendant is entitled to a directed \r\n  verdict when the State fails to present evidence of all of the elements of a \r\n  criminal offense.Â  See, e.g., State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 544 \r\n  S.E.2d 30 (2001).Â  In ruling on a directed verdict motion, the trial court is \r\n  concerned only with the existence of evidence, not its weight.Â  State v. \r\n  Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 564 S.E.2d 87 (2002).Â  \r\nOn appeal from the denial of a directed verdict \r\n  motion, an appellate court must view the evidence in the light most favorable \r\n  to the State, and if there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial \r\n  evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, we must find \r\n  the matter was properly presented to a jury.Â  McHoney, 344 S.C. at 97, \r\n  544 S.E.2d at 36.\r\nIn the current case, the victim testified \r\n  in detail regarding the four incidents of sexual molestation.Â  Moreover, her \r\n  testimony was corroborated by the testimony of her mother, school officials, \r\n  a desk clerk from the hotel where Tyler took the victim, and an investigating \r\n  officer from the Aiken County Sheriffâ€™s Office.\r\nTyler improperly asks us to evaluate the weight \r\n  of the evidence presented at trial, which is not the proper standard for submission \r\n  of the matter to the jury.Â  We hold the circuit court properly found there was \r\n  sufficient evidence to create a jury question as to Tylerâ€™s guilt or innocence.Â  \r\n  Consequently, the circuit court committed no error in denying Tylerâ€™s motion \r\n  for a directed verdict.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] Â  Citations are to the statutes in effect at the time of the hearing \r\n  since the legislature subsequently amended some of these provisions.Â  See 2002 Act No. 325, Â§ 5, effective June 7, 2002.Â  The amendments do not affect \r\n  our result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-064","title":"Davis v.

Wilson and Kenneth C. Porter, both of Greenville, for Appellant-Respondent.\r\n        Elizabeth Kimberly Berry, of Greenville, for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Barbara Hyland Davis \r\n  (Wife) and Randall K. Davis (Husband) appeal from several aspects of a divorce \r\n  decree.Â  We affirm in part and remand in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe parties married in May 1984 and separated \r\n  in October 1998.Â  They have two sons, born in 1990 and 1992. At the time of \r\n  the final divorce hearing, Husband was thirty-eight years old, and Wife was \r\n  thirty-nine years old. Both parties were employed during the marriage.Â  Husband \r\n  has a bachelorâ€™s degree in engineering and was employed at Design/Build Engineers, \r\n  Inc., a company in which he holds an ownership interest. Wife has a masterâ€™s \r\n  degree in business administration and, at the time of separation, was employed \r\n  in the accounting department at the Michelin Corporation. \r\nWife instituted this action against Husband \r\n  in November 1998 seeking an order of separate maintenance and support, equitable \r\n  apportionment of marital property and debts, alimony, custody, and attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees and costs. Husband answered and counterclaimed, seeking custody of the \r\n  children and equitable apportionment of marital property and debts. \r\nAt the commencement of the case, Wife moved \r\n  to exclude the testimony of Husbandâ€™s expert witness, James F. Joyner, III, \r\n  on the issue of the valuation of Husbandâ€™s business interests.Â  Wifeâ€™s basis \r\n  for this motion was that a pre-trial order required all expert witnesses be \r\n  named no later than twenty-one days before trial and Husband named Joyner only \r\n  twenty days before trial. [1]  Despite Wifeâ€™s objection to Joynerâ€™s testimony on the valuation of Husbandâ€™s \r\n  business interests, she consented to Joynerâ€™s testimony on the issues of Husbandâ€™s \r\n  income and income potential and Wifeâ€™s need for alimony. The family court granted \r\n  Wifeâ€™s motion to exclude Joynerâ€™s testimony on the valuation of Husbandâ€™s business \r\n  interests, but allowed Joyner to testify as to the other issues.Â  Husband proffered \r\n  Joynerâ€™s testimony on the valuation of his business interests.Â  \r\nThe family court granted Wife a divorce \r\n  from Husband on the grounds of one yearâ€™s continuous separation; ordered Husband \r\n  to pay quarterly installments of $4,729.75 in rehabilitative alimony for two \r\n  years; granted joint custody of the minor children to Husband and Wife, with \r\n  primary placement of the children being awarded to Husband; valued and equitably \r\n  apportioned marital property and debts; and denied Wifeâ€™s request for attorney \r\n  fees. \r\nHusband moved for reconsideration under \r\n  Rule 59(e), SCRCP, arguing the family court erred by excluding the testimony \r\n  of his expert witness regarding the value of his business interests, and in \r\n  applying low minority shareholder and marketability discounts to those interests.Â  \r\n  The family court issued an order increasing the amount of the minority shareholder \r\n  and marketability discounts, but not to the extent that Husband asserted the \r\n  discounts should be applied.Â  The court denied Husbandâ€™s request to reconsider \r\n  its decision to exclude the testimony of his expert witness.Â Â  Both Husband \r\n  and Wife appeal. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, \r\n  this court has authority to find the facts in accordance with our own view of \r\n  the preponderance of the evidence. Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, \r\n  471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â  This broad scope of review, however, does not require \r\n  us to disregard the findings of the court below. Stevenson v. Stevenson, \r\n  276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  We are mindful that the family \r\n  court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate \r\n  their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony. McAlister \r\n  v. Patterson, 278 S.C. 481, 483, 299 S.E.2d 322, 323 (1982).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Equitable Distribution\r\n Husband and wife agreed to distribute \r\n  their marital property equally; however, on appeal the parties argue the family \r\n  court erred in valuing Husbandâ€™s minority interests in two businesses and in \r\n  valuing a 1998 Harley-Davidson Motorcycle.Â  We address the valuation of the \r\n  two businesses and the motorcycle separately.\r\nA.Â Valuation of Design/Build and DBE\r\nAs a threshold \r\n  matter, Husband argues in his cross-appeal that the family court abused its \r\n  discretion in refusing to admit the testimony of his valuation expert, Joyner, \r\n  as to the value of Husbandâ€™s interest in Design/Build Engineers, Inc. and DBE \r\n  Partnership, LLP.Â  We agree. \r\nThe admission of expert testimony and \r\n  other evidence is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the family court \r\n  judge and absent a clear abuse of discretion, the family courtâ€™s ruling will \r\n  not be disturbed on appeal.Â  Elledge v. Richland/Lexington Sch. Dist. Five, \r\n  352 S.C. 179, 185, 573 S.E.2d 789, 792 (2002).Â  \r\nThe family court excluded Joynerâ€™s testimony \r\n  on the grounds that Husband failed to designate Joyner as an expert witness \r\n  at least twenty-one days before the final hearing, as required by a pre-trial \r\n  order entered by the court. It is undisputed that Husband first notified Wife \r\n  of his intent to call Joyner as an expert twenty days before the final hearing \r\n  was scheduled. \r\nRule 16(b) of the South Carolina Rules \r\n  of Civil Procedure grants the family court wide latitude to establish rules \r\n  regarding the conduct of discovery in each case, including the authority to \r\n  prescribe the time periods for identifying the exhibits or witnesses to be presented \r\n  at trial.Â  These pre-trial orders control the subsequent course of the case, \r\n  â€œunless modified on motion, or at the trial to prevent manifest injustice.â€Â  \r\n  Rule 16(b), SCRCP.Â  Accordingly, a pre-trial order should not be blindly followed, \r\n  but should instead be applied in a manner that best serves the ends of fairness \r\n  and judicial economy.Â  See James F. Flanagan, South Carolina Civil \r\n  Procedure 137 (2d ed. 1996) (â€œThe language [of Rule 16, SCRCP], particularly \r\n  the â€˜manifest injusticeâ€™ standard for modifying the order, suggests that good \r\n  reason should be required for any changes.Â  The order should not be followed \r\n  blindly.â€). \r\nOur courts have held that the exclusion \r\n  of a witness is a severe sanction that should not be imposed lightly or summarily. See Kramer v. Kramer, 323 S.C. 212, 217, 473 S.E.2d 846, 848-49 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1996) (finding that a court may exclude a witness â€œonly after the \r\n  court inquires into (1) the type of witness involved; (2) the content of the \r\n  evidence to be presented; (3) the nature of the failure to identify the witness; \r\n  and (4) the degree of surprise to the other party.â€).Â  The issue of excluding \r\n  a witness based on a pretrial order came before this court under similar facts \r\n  in Jumper v. Hawkins, 348 S.C. 142, 558 S.E.2d 911 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\n  In Jumper, the family court excluded a witness when the party failed \r\n  to comply with the pre-trial order requiring all witnesses to be designated \r\n  at least ten days before trial.Â  There, the opposing party was not informed \r\n  of the excluded witness until, at the latest, eight days before trial. Id. at 144, 558 S.E.2d at 912.Â  In finding the family court abused its discretion \r\n  by excluding the witness, this court stated:\r\nWe hold that even in the face \r\n  of a pre-trial order mandating the disclosure of a witness by a certain date, \r\n  a trial judge is required to consider and evaluate the following factors before \r\n  imposing the sanction of exclusion of a witness: \r\n\r\n  (1) the type of witness involved; \r\n  (2) the content of the evidence \r\n    emanating from the proffered witness; \r\n  (3) the nature of the failure \r\n    or neglect or refusal to furnish the witnessâ€™ name; \r\n  (4) the degree of surprise to \r\n    the other party, including the prior knowledge of the name of the witness; and \r\n  (5) the prejudice to the opposing \r\n    party.\r\n\r\n  Id. at 152, 558 S.E.2d at 916. [2] \r\nIn the present case, the record \r\n  provides no indication that the family court adequately considered these factors \r\n  when deciding to exclude Joynerâ€™s valuation testimony.Â  As an expert in valuing \r\n  closely-held corporations, Joynerâ€™s testimony would have been highly probative \r\n  on the question of the proper valuation methodology to apply in this case.Â  \r\n  Husbandâ€™s failure to comply with the terms of the pre-trial order by one day \r\n  resulted in little surprise or cognizable prejudice to Wifeâ€™s case.Â  Wifeâ€™s \r\n  own expert and attorney had ample time to meet with Joyner and did, in fact, \r\n  question Joyner the day before trial.Â  Furthermore, Wife consented to the admission \r\n  of Joynerâ€™s testimony on the issue of determining salary for purposes of awarding \r\n  alimony.Â  As such, we find the family court erred in excluding the testimony \r\n  of Husbandâ€™s expert witness.\r\nMoreover, we cannot say \r\n  the family courtâ€™s exclusion of Husbandâ€™s expert witness was harmless.Â  Joynerâ€™s \r\n  proffered testimony suggested applying a thirty percent minority discount and \r\n  twenty percent marketability discount to Husbandâ€™s interest in DBE.Â  As to husbandâ€™s \r\n  other business interest in Design/Build, Joyner suggested applying a twenty-five \r\n  percent minority discount and a thirty percent marketability discount to Husbandâ€™s \r\n  interest.Â Â  Even after increasing the minority and marketability discounts pursuant \r\n  to Husbandâ€™s motion for reconsideration, the family courtâ€™s discounts were less \r\n  than the discounts Husbandâ€™s expert would have recommended in his testimony.Â  \r\nTherefore, we find the family court abused \r\n  its discretion by excluding the testimony of Husbandâ€™s expert witness.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we do not reach the merits of the partiesâ€™ arguments as to the family courtâ€™s \r\n  valuation of Husbandâ€™s interests in Design/Build and DBE.Â  Instead, we remand \r\n  this issue to the family court so that the testimony of Husbandâ€™s expert may \r\n  be admitted and given full consideration.Â  In remanding, we do not make any \r\n  finding as to the propriety of applying discounts to Husbandâ€™s interest in Design/Build \r\n  and DBE.Â  Rather, we remand for a de novo determination of the \r\n  value of these assets, including Husbandâ€™s claim that discounts should be utilized.\r\nB. Valuation of the Motorcycle\r\nWife also contests \r\n  the family courtâ€™s valuation of Husbandâ€™s motorcycle.Â  She first argues the \r\n  family court erred by relying too heavily on Husbandâ€™s testimony.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAt the final hearing, Wife testified \r\n  that the purchase price of the motorcycle in 1998 was $8,300.Â  She further testified \r\n  that she did not feel that the motorcycle had depreciated in value at all over \r\n  time and that its current value remained at $8,300.Â  Husband agreed he had paid \r\n  $8,320 when he purchased the motorcycle, but testified the motorcycle had sustained \r\n  body damage after being accidentally dropped, and that the damage had not been \r\n  repaired at the time of the hearing.Â  Husband also admitted evidence, over Wifeâ€™s \r\n  objection, that the Kelly Blue Book value as of the date of the hearing for \r\n  that make and model motorcycle with no damage was $4,835.Â  The family court \r\n  ultimately valued the motorcycle at this blue book amount.\r\nâ€œThe credibility of testimony is a matter \r\n  for the fact finder to judge.â€Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Forrester, \r\n  282 S.C. 512, 516, 320 S.E.2d 39, 42 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  In this case, the family \r\n  court was in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the partiesâ€™ testimony.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we find no reason to conclude the family court erred in its consideration \r\n  of Husbandâ€™s testimony on this issue.\r\nWife also argues the family court improperly \r\n  relied on the blue book value of the motorcycle in assessing its value.Â  She \r\n  claims the $4,835 amount quoted does not accurately reflect the value of the \r\n  motorcycle in the present case because that blue book figure represented the \r\n  â€œwholesale trade-inâ€ value of the bike.Â  This argument was not presented to \r\n  the trial court and is therefore not preserved for appeal.Â  See Staubes \r\n  v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (â€œ[A]n \r\n  issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised \r\n  to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.â€).Â  \r\n  Wife objected to the admission of the blue book figure because the value quoted \r\n  in the blue book was the value of the motorcycle in March 2000, over a year \r\n  after the commencement of the marital litigation in this case.Â  Wife asserts \r\n  this argument on appeal.Â  However, we find the date of the blue book value goes \r\n  to the weight of the evidence and not its sufficiency.Â Â  The weight to be given \r\n  to evidence lies within the province of the fact finder.Â  Bailey v. Bailey, \r\n  293 S.C. 451, 453, 361 S.E.2d 348, 350 (1987).Â  Because the family court was \r\n  in a better position to weigh the evidence presented at trial, we find the court \r\n  did not err in assessing the value of the motorcycle.\r\nII. Alimony\r\nWife next argues the family court erred \r\n  by awarding her rehabilitative alimony rather than permanent periodic alimony.Â  \r\n  Section 20-3-130(C)(8) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2002) requires a court, \r\n  in awarding alimony, to consider, inter alia, â€œthe marital and nonmarital \r\n  properties of the parties, including those apportioned to him or her in the \r\n  divorce or separate maintenance action.â€Â  Although we do not hold that an award \r\n  of rehabilitative alimony is improper in this case, we find the amount of the \r\n  rehabilitative alimony awarded was at least partially predicated on an amount \r\n  of money Wife had previously received from her interest in Design/Build and \r\n  DBE.Â  In light of our decision to remand the issue of equitable division of \r\n  marital property, we remand the issue of alimony to the family court.\r\nIII. Child Custody\r\nWife argues the family court erred in \r\n  awarding Husband primary placement of the partiesâ€™ minor children. We disagree.\r\nIn all child custody disputes, \r\n  the paramount considerations are the childâ€™s welfare and best interests. Cook \r\n  v. Cobb, 271 S.C. 136, 140, 245 S.E.2d 612, 614 (1978). In awarding custody, \r\n  the family court should consider how the custody decision will impact the childâ€™s \r\n  life, including physical, psychological, spiritual, educational, familial, emotional, \r\n  and recreational aspects.Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 11, 471 S.E.2d \r\n  154, 157 (1996).Â  Additionally, the court must assess how each partyâ€™s character, \r\n  fitness, and attitude affect the child. Id.Â  Indeed, â€œwhen determining \r\n  to whom custody shall be awarded, all the conflicting rules and presumptions \r\n  should be weighed together with all of the circumstances of the particular case, \r\n  and all relevant factors must be taken into consideration.â€ Id.Â  \r\nIn this case, Husband has had \r\n  primary placement of the children since September 1999.Â  Our courts have considered \r\n  a parentâ€™s history as the primary caretaker to be an important factor in determining \r\n  which parent is best suited to receive custody of a child.Â  See Smith \r\n  v. Smith, 294 S.C. 194, 197, 363 S.E.2d 404, 406 (Ct. App. 1987) (holding \r\n  that the fact the wife had custody of the children since the partiesâ€™ separation \r\n  â€œalone supports the trial courtâ€™s decision in this instance to place the children \r\n  in the wifeâ€™s custodyâ€); West v. West, 294 S.C. 190, 193, 363 S.E.2d \r\n  402, 403 (Ct. App. 1987) (awarding custody to the husband after finding that \r\n  he had been the primary caretaker of the children in the months prior to separation); \r\n  Roy T. Stuckey, Marital Litigation in South Carolina: Substantive Law 433 (3d ed. 2001) (â€œThere is an assumption that custody will be awarded to the \r\n  parent who has been the primary caretaker of the children, unless unfitnessÂ  \r\n  is proved or there is other evidence that the welfare of a child will be better \r\n  served by awarding custody to the other parentâ€).\r\nAdditionally, the evidence supports \r\n  the family courtâ€™s finding that Husband has taken a more active role in the \r\n  daily lives of the children.Â  Husband was primarily responsible for getting \r\n  the children ready each morning and taking them to school or daycare.Â  He also \r\n  shared in the responsibility of picking up the children after school, and served \r\n  as the primary facilitator of the childrenâ€™s after-school sports activities.Â  \r\n Furthermore, the family court \r\n  found Husband has been able to manage the childrenâ€™s behavior more appropriately \r\n  than Wife. This conclusion is supported by the observations and recommendations \r\n  of independent experts contained in the record.Â  The guardian ad litem concluded \r\n  that:\r\nBased upon [the psychologistâ€™s] \r\n  report and the partiesâ€™ actions during this litigation, I believe the father \r\n  will allow the mother to participate in the childrenâ€™s lives.Â  It does not appear \r\n  the mother will allow the father to do so. The report also indicates the children \r\n  have fewer behavioral problems with the father and therefore a more stable environment. \r\nIndeed, the psychologistâ€™s report states that â€œ[Wife] \r\n  does appear to be much less able to behaviorally manage the children . . . .Â  \r\n  I would not judge her to be seriously deficient in this area, but in comparison \r\n  to [Husband] she is clearly less well-equipped.â€ \r\nTherefore, under the facts and circumstances \r\n  of this case, we find no error in the family courtâ€™s decision to award primary \r\n  placement of the children to Husband.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing \r\n  reasons, we affirm the family courtâ€™s valuation of Husbandâ€™s motorcycle and \r\n  determination of child custody.Â Â  However, as to the valuation of the Husbandâ€™s \r\n  business interests, we remand to the family court for consideration of Husbandâ€™s \r\n  expert testimony.Â  Because we remand a portion of the equitable division of \r\n  marital property, we also remand the issue of alimony.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REMANDED IN PART.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HOWARD and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   [1] Wifeâ€™s own expert and attorney met with Joyner \r\n    and questioned him the day before trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n   [2] The final hearing in this case came to a conclusion \r\n    on April 13, 2000.Â  The opinion in Jumper was decided on December 17, \r\n    2001, more than one year after the final hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-065","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney \r\n          General Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General Melody J. Brown, all of \r\n          Columbia;Â  and Solicitor Cecil Kelly Jackson, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Appellant Jermaine Harris was \r\n  convicted of murder, assault and battery with intent to kill, armed robbery, \r\n  and possession of a weapon during a crime of violence in connection with the \r\n  robbery of a convenience store that left one of the storeâ€™s owners dead and \r\n  the other injured.Â  He appeals, asserting error in the trial courtâ€™s exclusion \r\n  of extrinsic impeachment evidence and in its refusal to charge the jury on mere \r\n  knowledge. We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAround 11:00 p.m. on December 21, 1999, Perry Loyd \r\n  and his wife were closing up the B &amp; D convenience store they owned.Â  Mrs. \r\n  Loyd waited in their truck while Mr. Loyd locked the storeâ€™s door.Â  As he locked \r\n  the door, an individual holding a gun surprised him and told Mr. Loyd to â€œgive \r\n  it up.â€Â  The individual then fired two shots.Â  Mr. Loyd backed away from the \r\n  storefront and pulled out his gun.Â  A second individual then moved toward Mr. \r\n  Loyd, stumbled, and fired his gun at Mr. Loyd.Â  A third individual then came \r\n  around the side of the store, raised his gun, and fired two shots at Mr. Loyd, \r\n  hitting him directly below the knee.Â  Mr. Loyd was shot a total of six times \r\n  from three different guns.Â  Mrs. Loyd died from a gunshot wound to the head.\r\nMr. Loyd identified Rashaun Brooks as the first shooter, \r\n  Paris McLeod as the second shooter, and Harris as the third shooter.Â  All three \r\n  defendants were arrested shortly after the robbery upon Mr. Loydâ€™s positive \r\n  identification.Â  \r\nAt the residence where the three defendants were \r\n  arrested, the police also arrested Leroy Porter on separate and unrelated charges.Â  \r\n  Porter approached the investigating officers after he was arrested.Â  As a result \r\n  of the conversation, the officers went to Young Street in an attempt to locate \r\n  the guns used in the robbery.Â  After the first attempt failed, Officer Gardner \r\n  asked Porter to wear a hidden microphone and record a conversation with Rashaun \r\n  Brooks to get a lead on the location of the guns.Â  After reviewing the recorded \r\n  conversation, the police located a Mack 90 rifle that was positively connected \r\n  to the shells recovered from the scene.\r\nAt trial, Officer Gardner was asked on cross-examination \r\n  whether he previously stated that he had reached an agreement with Porter.Â  \r\n  Gardner denied having made such a statement.Â  The trial attorney representing \r\n  Paris McLeod then sought to introduce the testimony of John Davis to show that \r\n  Gardner, in fact, previously stated that a deal had been reached with Porter.Â  \r\n  The trial court sustained the solicitorâ€™s objection that the testimony was improper \r\n  impeachment testimony.Â  All three defendants joined in the proposed impeachment \r\n  proffer.Â  \r\nAfter hearing the proposed jury instructions, the \r\n  defense argued the trial court should charge that mere knowledge, in addition \r\n  to mere presence and mere association, was also insufficient to justify a conviction.Â  \r\n  The court denied the motion, and charged the jury on mere presence and association, \r\n  but not mere knowledge.Â  The jury found Harris guilty, and he was sentenced \r\n  to thirty years for murder, seven years consecutive for assault and battery \r\n  with intent to kill, five years concurrent for armed robbery, and five years \r\n  concurrent for possession of a weapon during a crime of violence.Â  This appeal \r\n  follows.\r\nISSUES\r\n1.Â  Did the trial court err in refusing to allow extrinsic \r\n  impeachment evidence about whether an agreement had been entered into with Leroy \r\n  Porter?Â  \r\n2. Â Did the trial court err in refusing to instruct the \r\n  jury that mere knowledge was insufficient to establish guilt?Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nImpeachment Evidence\r\nHarris asserts the trial court erred in refusing to \r\n  admit extrinsic evidence contradicting the testimony of one of the Stateâ€™s witnesses.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nRule 613(b), SCRE, provides, in part: \r\n\r\n  Extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a \r\n    witness is not admissible unless the witness is advised of the substance of \r\n    the statement, the time and place it was allegedly made, and the person to whom \r\n    it was made, and is given the opportunity to explain or deny the statement. \r\n    If a witness does not admit that he has made the prior inconsistent statement, \r\n    extrinsic evidence of such statement is admissible.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, â€œ[e]very witness under cross-examination \r\n  may be asked whether he has made any former statements relative to the subject \r\n  matter of the action and inconsistent with his present testimony.â€Â  Aakjer \r\n  v. Spagnoli, 291 S.C. 165, 170, 352 S.E.2d 503, 507 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  In \r\n  order to contradict a witness by introducing a prior statement, a foundation \r\n  must be laid putting the witness on notice.Â  McMillan v. Ridges, 229 \r\n  S.C. 76, 79-80, 91 S.E.2d 883, 884 (1956).Â  This notice requirement is â€œmet \r\n  when the cross-examiner advises the witness of the substance of the prior statement,â€ \r\n  the time and place of the statement, and the person to whom the statement was \r\n  made.Â  State v. Galloway, 263 S.C. 585, 591, 211 S.E.2d 885, 888 (1975).Â  \r\n  The standard of review for the admissibility of evidence limits reversal by \r\n  this court to situations amounting to an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Saltz, \r\n  346 S.C. 114, 121, 551 S.E.2d 240, 244 (2001).Â  \r\nIn this case, Harrisâ€™s co-defendant sought to contradict \r\n  Officer Gardnerâ€™s denial that Gardner and Leroy Porter made an agreement.Â  The \r\n  record indicates defense counsel alleged the conversation occurred in the solicitorâ€™s \r\n  office, but the proffered testimony suggests the location was elsewhere.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  defense counsel could only pinpoint the alleged statement to being â€œduring the \r\n  course of the investigation.â€Â  Reviewing the admissibility of this evidence \r\n  under the abuse of discretion standard, we cannot conclude that the trial court \r\n  erred in excluding this evidence where the prerequisites of the notice requirement \r\n  in Rule 613(b), SCRE, were not satisfied.\r\nMere Knowledge Instruction\r\nHarris asserts the trial court erred \r\n  in refusing to include a jury charge that a defendantâ€™s mere knowledge that \r\n  a crime was going to occur is insufficient to constitute guilt.Â  After hearing \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s proposed jury instructions, the defense argued the court should \r\n  charge that mere knowledge, in addition to mere presence and mere association, \r\n  was also insufficient to justify a conviction. Â The court denied the motion.Â  \r\nThe evidence presented at trial determines the \r\n  law with which the jury should be charged.Â  Although a trial court â€œcommits \r\n  reversible error when it fails to give a requested charge on an issue raised \r\n  by the indictment and evidence presented,â€ the court should charge the jury \r\n  with only the law applicable to the case.Â  State v. Lee, 298 S.C. 362, \r\n  364, 380 S.E.2d 834, 835-36 (1989).Â  Superfluous and inapplicable instructions \r\n  should be meticulously avoided, for the purpose of jury instructions is to enlighten \r\n  the jury; redundant instructions and those not in conformance with the facts \r\n  of a case only operate to imbue unwarranted confusion in the minds of jurors.Â  State v. Fair, 209 S.C. 439, 445, 40 S.E.2d 634, 637 (1946); see also State v. Franklin, 299 S.C. 133, 382 S.E.2d 911 (1989).\r\nAlthough Harrisâ€™s proposed charge that \r\n  mere knowledge a crime is going to be committed does not, in and of itself, \r\n  establish guilt is a correct statement of law, an additional instruction to \r\n  that affect would be of no particular relevance to this case.Â  In State v. \r\n  Collins, 266 S.C. 566, 570, 225 S.E.2d 189, 192 (1976), the mere knowledge \r\n  charge was necessitated by the fact that there was evidence that the defendant \r\n  could not have been the principal to the armed robbery because he was in jail \r\n  at the time the store was robbed.Â  In this case, there is evidence of Harrisâ€™s \r\n  presence at the scene.Â  In addition to the testimony that Harris had prior knowledge \r\n  that a crime was going to be committed against the Loyds, Mr. Loydâ€™s testimony \r\n  placed Harris at the scene as one of the individuals who shot him.Â  There is \r\n  no indication anywhere in the record of the impossibility of Harrisâ€™s participation \r\n  or that he was not present at the scene.Â  The trial court acted appropriately \r\n  in denying the request to charge on mere knowledge.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Harrisâ€™s convictions are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HOWARD, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-066","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney \r\n          General Donald J. Zelenka, all of Columbia;Â  and Solicitor Cecil Kelley Jackson, \r\n          of Sumter; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Clarence Huell was convicted \r\n  of murder, possession of a weapon in the commission of a violent crime, and \r\n  two counts of assault and battery.Â  The trial judge sentenced him to thirty \r\n  years imprisonment for murder, five years imprisonment for possession of a firearm \r\n  in the commission of a violent crime, and thirty days imprisonment for each \r\n  count of simple assault. Â Huell appeals, asserting error in: (1) the exclusion \r\n  of evidence; and (2) the Stateâ€™s closing argument.Â  We affirm.Â Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn November 5, 2000, the Williamsburg County Sheriffâ€™s \r\n  Department responded to a dispatch regarding a shooting at the home of Jeanette \r\n  Wilsonâ€™s mother.Â  Wilson was Clarence Huellâ€™s estranged girlfriend.Â  She had \r\n  been with the victim, Joseph Lesane, at a club earlier when Huell asked her \r\n  not to take Lesane to her house.Â  Huell subsequently came to the house, and \r\n  an altercation ensued between Wilson and Huell.Â  Huell also struck Wilsonâ€™s \r\n  mother, Emma.Â  Huell kept a nine-millimeter pistol in his car.Â  Â Â After \r\n  Wilson went into the house to call police, two gunshots were heard.Â  The shooting \r\n  resulted in the Lesaneâ€™s death.Â  The police were unable to find any witnesses \r\n  who saw the incident involving Huell and Lesane.Â Â  \r\nHuell was indicted for murder, possession of a \r\n  weapon in the commission of a violent crime, and two counts of assault and battery \r\n  of a high and aggravated nature.Â  Huell admitted killing Lesane, but claimed \r\n  he did so in self-defense.Â  According to Huell, Lesane attempted to run over \r\n  him with the car.Â  Huell claimed that the gun had accidentally discharged after \r\n  he had been hit by Lesaneâ€™s car and was hanging on the hood.Â  The jury convicted \r\n  him on all charges, and he was sentenced.Â  This appeal follows.Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court \r\n  sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Cutter, 261 S.C. 140, 147, \r\n  199 S.E.2d 61, 65 (1973).Â  We are bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings \r\n  unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, \r\n  452, 527 S.E.2d 105, 111 (2000).Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n I.&nbsp; Relevant Evidence \r\nHuell argues the trial court \r\n  erred by refusing to allow the defense to cross-examine the pathologist who \r\n  performed the autopsy, Dr. Susan McConnell, about a portion of the autopsy report \r\n  for the purpose of reflecting the inadequate investigation conducted by law \r\n  enforcement.Â  We agree, but find exclusion of the testimony was harmless error.Â Â  \r\nThe defense argued that numerous \r\n  errors by law enforcement in the investigation were all relevant to the juryâ€™s \r\n  determination of whether the State had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  \r\n  The defense presented considerable evidence in this regard.Â  The defense theory \r\n  of an inadequate investigation consisted of the failure to maintain clothing, \r\n  the failure to process the vehicle, and the failure to utilize the technical \r\n  services of SLED.Â  \r\nDr. McConnell performed the autopsy of \r\n  the victim and testified as a Stateâ€™s witness.Â  At trial, she was qualified \r\n  as an expert in forensic pathology and testified that the victim died of a single \r\n  gunshot wound.Â  She testified that the gunshot had been â€œfrom an indeterminate \r\n  range.â€Â  On cross-examination, Dr. McConnell admitted she usually got \r\n  the victimâ€™s clothing at the time of the autopsy.Â  She said, â€œthe clothing can \r\n  be sent to SLED for evaluation of gunshot residue et cetera, et cetera.Â  We \r\n  like to see the clothing so if we want to see something, so we could, you know, \r\n  try to make a determination.â€Â  In this case, she did not receive any clothing \r\n  from law enforcement.Â  Â Â \r\nWhen defense counsel began to question \r\n  Dr. McConnell about the contents of the autopsy report, particularly a statement \r\n  in the report from the deputy coroner, the State objected on the basis of hearsay \r\n  and relevance.Â  Â Â Outside the presence of the jury, defense counsel referenced \r\n  the statement in the autopsy report that a suspect and weapon were in the custody \r\n  of the sheriffâ€™s department.Â  It is undisputed that this information was false.Â  \r\n  The State did not contest the fact that the information was given to Dr. McConnell.Â  \r\n  In fact, â€œthere was no weapon foundâ€ and no suspect was in custody at the time.Â  \r\n  Defense counsel argued it was relevant to the case in terms of additional evidence \r\n  bearing upon the defense strategy challenging the quality of the investigation \r\n  performed by law enforcement.Â  Thus, Huell sought admissibility based on the \r\n  falsity of the information.Â  The trial judge excluded the testimony as hearsay.Â  \r\nPursuant to Rule 801(c) SCRE, hearsay is â€œa statement, \r\n  other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, \r\n  offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.â€Â  Since the relevancy \r\n  of the evidence was grounded in its falsity, it was not hearsay.Â  The purpose \r\n  of eliciting this portion of the autopsy report from the pathologist was to \r\n  establish yet another example of the alleged inadequate investigation by law \r\n  enforcement.Â  \r\nEven assuming it was error to exclude the evidence, \r\n  such error was harmless.Â  See State v. McWee, 322 S.C. 387, 393, \r\n  472 S.E.2d 235, 239 (1996);Â  State v. Benning, 338 S.C. 59, 64, 524 S.E.2d \r\n  852, 856 (Ct. App. 1999) (finding that an accused cannot avail himself of error \r\n  as a ground for reversal where the error has not been prejudicial to him).Â  \r\n  We find the exclusion of the testimony was harmless, because it was cumulative \r\n  to other evidence bearing upon Huellâ€™s challenge to the investigation by law \r\n  enforcement, such as the failure of law enforcement to preserve clothing, to \r\n  process the vehicle, and to utilize the technical services of SLED.Â  Huellâ€™s \r\n  counsel acknowledged at oral argument that the excluded evidence was additional evidence supporting Huellâ€™s claim of an inadequate investigation by law enforcement.Â  \r\n  We view the excluded evidence in the autopsy report as cumulative, and thus \r\n  conclude Huell was not legally prejudiced by its exclusion.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nII. Closing Argument \r\nDuring closing argument, the solicitor \r\n  noted the close proximity of the bullet holes in the windshield.Â  The solicitor \r\n  argued the proximity of the bullet holes reflected the steady position of the \r\n  pistol when Huell shot Lesane.Â  This, according to the solicitor, supported \r\n  the Stateâ€™s theory of the killing as a murder and mitigated against Huellâ€™s \r\n  claim of self-defense.Â  The solicitorâ€™s argument rested in part on what he referred \r\n  to as the lack of â€œrecoil.â€Â  The solicitor argued:Â Â Â  \r\nSTATE:Â  . . . Common sense would \r\n  tell you that if a gun is in a steady position and it is laying right here, \r\n  and itâ€™s in a vice, and you pulled the trigger once, that gun canâ€™t move because \r\n  itâ€™s in that vice . . . But if a person would hold a gun, a recoil would \r\n  make the gun move some.Â Â  And the pattern is ---\r\nDEFENSE:Â  Objection, Your Honor.\r\nSTATE:Â  ---more erratic.\r\nDEFENSE:Â  Objection, arguing facts that are not in evidence.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Objection is overruled.\r\nSTATE:Â  . . . Now you look at the gunshots on that automobile.Â  \r\n  That gun, I submit to you, was not doing a whole lot of moving.Â  It was moving \r\n  some, but it wasnâ€™t doing the kind of moving that if you had a man hanging on \r\n  for dear life on a vehicle like he was saying he was doing, that gun would have \r\n  been all around, everywhere . . . And those bullets would have been all \r\n  over everywhere. \r\nBut where have you got them?Â  \r\n  Youâ€™ve got them right in a row there.Â  Right near where the driver was seated.Â  \r\n  And I submit to you that the more likely thing was the fellow was standing there \r\n  pumping the bullets in him . . . he intended to kill him.Â  \r\n(emphasis added)\r\nOur review of the closing argument is based on \r\n  whether the solicitorâ€™s comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to \r\n  make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.Â  State v. Durden, \r\n  264 S.C. 86, 93, 212 S.E.2d 587, 590 (1975).Â  State v. Caldwell, 300 \r\n  S.C. 494, 504, 388 S.E.2d 816, 822 (1990);Â  State v. Davis, 309 S.C. \r\n  326, 347, 422 S.E.2d 133, 146 (1992), overruled on other grounds by Brightman \r\n  v. State, 336 S.C. 348, 520 S.E.2d 614 (1999).Â  The Stateâ€™s closing argument \r\n  must be confined to evidence in the record and the reasonable inferences that \r\n  may be drawn from the evidence.Â  State v. Huggins, 325 S.C. 103, 107, \r\n  481 S.E.2d 114, 116 (1997); State v. Copeland, 321 S.C. 318, 326, 468 \r\n  S.E.2d 620, 625 (1996); State v. Linder, 276 S.C. 304, 312, 278 S.E.2d \r\n  335, 339 (1981).Â  The trial court is vested with broad discretion in determining \r\n  the propriety of counselâ€™s closing arguments and will not be disturbed absent \r\n  a showing of an abuse of discretion.Â  State v.Â  Raffaldt, 318 S.C. 110, \r\n  114, 456 S.E.2d 390, 393 (1995).Â  \r\nHuell argues the solicitorâ€™s argument was outside \r\n  the record and that he used his â€œexpertiseâ€ to argue the mechanical workings \r\n  of a firearm.Â  This was at odds with Huellâ€™s testimony that the gun had accidentally \r\n  discharged after he had been hit by Lesaneâ€™s car and was hanging on the hood.Â  Â \r\nIn light of Huellâ€™s testimony, especially his version \r\n  of his position on the hood of the moving car at the time he shot Lesane, we \r\n  find the prosecutorâ€™s comments did not infect the trial with unfairness as to \r\n  make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.Â  According to Huell:Â  \r\nWhen [Lesane] tried to run over me, I had jump up.Â  And the \r\n  car struck me on this knee.Â  And thatâ€™s when it throwed me up against the windshield \r\n  of the car.Â  My head hit the car again, and the gun went off.Â  So he get on \r\n  the brakes to try to throw me off the car.Â  But by my hand, left hand, it had \r\n  me in between the hood and the windshield of the car.Â  It caused me to slide \r\n  down on the car hood.Â  And I pulled myself back from the car.Â  He take off again.Â  \r\n  Thatâ€™s when I raised the gun up, and I shot the gun again.\r\nWe believe it is within a reasonable jurorâ€™s common \r\n  knowledge that if a firearm is discharged by an individual in the situation \r\n  described by Huell, the resulting location of the shots will tend to be varied.Â  \r\n  One may reasonably infer that it is less likely, under such a scenario, for \r\n  the shots to be located in a straight line.Â  We believe the solicitorâ€™s comments \r\n  concerning recoil in the context of Huellâ€™s testimony fell within the range \r\n  of a reasonable inference from the evidence.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, based on the reasons set forth above, \r\n  Huellâ€™s convictions and sentences are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HOWARD, and KITTREDGE, J.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-067","title":"State v.

Cobb, 532 U.S. 162, \r\n  173 (2001) (holding when the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches, it only \r\n  encompasses the charged offense and any other offenses that would be considered \r\n  the same for purposes of double jeopardy); State v.

Strom, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-078\r\nHeard November 4, 2003 â€“ Filed February \r\n  12, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJean Perrin Derrick, of Lexington, for Appellant.\r\nCarolyn B. Steigner and Daun C. Steigner, both of Lexington, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM: In this domestic case, \r\n  Frank DuBose (â€œFatherâ€) sued Kathy Sarnowski (â€œMotherâ€), seeking a change of \r\n  custody following Motherâ€™s move with her new husband to Kentucky.Â  The family \r\n  court found a change of circumstances occurred and granted a change of custody \r\n  to Father.Â  Additionally, the family court granted Fatherâ€™s request for attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees.Â  Mother appeals, arguing the family court erred by:Â  1) finding a change \r\n  of circumstances occurred based solely upon Motherâ€™s move from South Carolina \r\n  to Kentucky; 2) excluding evidence of the childrenâ€™s custody preference; 3) \r\n  excluding evidence of Fatherâ€™s past violent acts; 4) awarding Father attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees; and 5) refusing to award Mother attorneyâ€™s fees.Â Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nFather and Mother were divorced in 2000, and pursuant to \r\n  an agreement later incorporated into a divorce decree, Mother was granted sole \r\n  custody of the children.Â  The divorce decree also provided that if Mother intended \r\n  to move out of the state with the children, she could only do so after giving \r\n  Father seventy-five days notice.Â  \r\nOn March 3, 2000, Mother gave Father written notice of her \r\n  intent to move out of the state with the children.Â  However, she did not provide \r\n  Father with information as to where she was moving.Â  On May 18 or 19, 2000, \r\n  Mother left South Carolina with the intention of permanently moving to Kentucky \r\n  with her new husband.Â  \r\nFather filed a summons and complaint seeking custody of the \r\n  children, and following a hearing at which Mother did not appear, the family \r\n  court awarded Father temporary custody.Â  \r\nAt the final hearing, the family court found that a substantial \r\n  change of circumstances occurred, and the best interests of the children would \r\n  be served by awarding custody to Father.Â  Additionally, the court awarded Father \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Mother appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œOn appeal from an order of the family court, this \r\n  court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own view of the \r\n  preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Hopkins v. Hopkins, 343 S.C. 301, 304, \r\n  540 S.E.2d 454, 456 (2000).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require \r\n  this Court to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Greene v. Greene, \r\n  351 S.C. 329, 335, 569 S.E.2d 393, 397 (Ct. App. 2002).Â Â  Rather, because this \r\n  Court lacks the opportunity for direct observation of witnesses, it should give \r\n  great deference to the family courtâ€™s findings where matters of credibility \r\n  are involved, especially in cases involving the welfare and best interests of \r\n  children.Â  Kisling v. Allison, 343 S.C. 674, 677-78, 541 S.E.2d 273, \r\n  275 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change of Circumstances \r\n   \r\n Mother argues the family court erred \r\n  by ruling her relocation to Kentucky, standing alone, constituted a change of \r\n  circumstances sufficient to alter the custody award.Â  \r\nAppellate courts should interpret judgments by \r\n  the trial courts as they would any other instrument.Â  Eddins v. Eddins, \r\n  304 S.C. 133, 135-36, 403 S.E.2d 164, 166 (Ct. App. 1991); see also State \r\n  v. Evans, 354 S.C. 579, 584, 582 S.E.2d 407, 410 (2003) (holding an appellate \r\n  court must view the circuit courtâ€™s statements as a whole to determine its reasoning).Â  \r\n\r\nThe family courtâ€™s order states in pertinent part: \r\n\r\n\r\nI find that the move to Kentucky is not beneficial to the \r\n  children; that their lives would not be enhanced by the move; that their relationship \r\n  with their father was very good prior to the move and would suffer; and that \r\n  the motherâ€™s reasons for moving were very poor . . . . This Court finds that \r\n  the motherâ€™s move to Kentucky and subsequent behavior constitutes \r\n  a substantial change in circumstances which necessitates a change in permanent \r\n  custody to the father. \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Additionally, the family courtâ€™s \r\n  numerous findings of fact and conclusions of law support the conclusion the \r\n  decision is based on many factors, only one of which was Motherâ€™s move to Kentucky.Â  \r\n  Thus, Motherâ€™s claim that the family court found a change of circumstances and \r\n  altered the custody award based solely on her move to Kentucky is without merit.\r\nFurthermore, based on our own review of the record \r\n  and considering the totality of the circumstances, we hold the family court \r\n  did not err by altering the custody award and awarding custody to Father. \r\nIn South Carolina, there is a presumption against \r\n  removing a child from the state.Â  McAlister v. Patterson, 278 S.C. 481, \r\n  483, 299 S.E.2d 322, 323 (1982).Â  However, the presumption may be rebutted by \r\n  a showing the move will benefit the child. See id. at 483, 299 \r\n  S.E.2d at 323 (â€œIn situations where removal will benefit the child, removal \r\n  has been allowed.â€). Thus, the question of whether relocation will be allowed \r\n  requires a determination of whether relocation is in the best interest of the \r\n  children.Â  Rice v. Rice, 335 S.C. 449, 454, 517 S.E.2d 220, 222 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999).Â  In child custody cases, a court must examine the totality of the \r\n  circumstances to determine the best interests of the child.Â  Wheeler v. Gill, \r\n  307 S.C. 94, 99, 413 S.E.2d 860, 863 (Ct. App. 1992).\r\nIn reaching a determination as to custody, the \r\n  family court should consider how the custody decision will impact all areas \r\n  of the childâ€™s life, including physical, psychological, spiritual, educational, \r\n  familial, emotional, and recreational aspects.Â  Pountain v. Pountain, \r\n  332 S.C. 130, 136, 503 S.E.2d 757, 760 (Ct. App. 1998). Additionally, the court \r\n  must assess each partyâ€™s character, fitness, and attitude as they affect the \r\n  child.Â  Id. at 136, 503 S.E.2d at 760.Â  \r\nFather resides in South Carolina, with his relatives living \r\n  nearby, in a town where the children have gone to school their whole lives.Â  \r\n  The record indicates Father works full-time, and thus, when the children are \r\n  in Fatherâ€™s custody, his mother watches the children and cooks for them on a \r\n  regular basis.Â  Notwithstanding that, the Guardian ad Litem (â€œGALâ€) testified \r\n  it was in the childrenâ€™s best interest to stay in South Carolina where they \r\n  have gone to school and have relatives nearby.Â  \r\nAdditionally, the GAL testified the children are bonded with \r\n  their Father.Â  Therefore, allowing Mother to retain custody in Kentucky would \r\n  have a negative impact on Fatherâ€™s relationship with the children.Â  \r\nEvidence within the record indicates during Mother and Fatherâ€™s \r\n  marriage, Father had physical confrontations with both Mother and Randall, Motherâ€™s \r\n  son by a previous marriage.Â  However, the evidence also indicates the confrontations \r\n  with Mother have not occurred since the end of their marriage, and the confrontations \r\n  with Randall have not occurred since 1991.Â  \r\nOn Motherâ€™s side, the record indicates during the summer \r\n  of 2000, Mother, her new husband, several pets, and the children lived in a \r\n  hotel room in Kentucky.Â  Subsequently, Mother, her new husband, and the children \r\n  moved into a farmhouse.Â  \r\nThe record indicates Mother is unemployed, and although she \r\n  claims to have a disability, she did not provide evidence in the record to support \r\n  her claim.Â  \r\nWhile the children are with Mother, Mother primarily cares \r\n  for the childrenâ€™s needs.Â  Additionally, testimony within the record indicates \r\n  Mother is more patient and understanding of the children, communicates better \r\n  with them, and is more involved in their lives than Father.Â  \r\nHowever, we are concerned with Motherâ€™s ability to provide \r\n  a safe, stable environment for the children.Â  Initially, we are most concerned \r\n  with evidence indicating Motherâ€™s new husband is violent.Â  The evidence in this \r\n  regard indicates that shortly after moving to Kentucky, Motherâ€™s new husband \r\n  attacked her with a hammer.Â  Mother called the police, and Motherâ€™s new husband \r\n  was charged with criminal domestic violence.Â  \r\nAdditionally, the record indicates patterns of instability.Â  \r\n  First, this is Motherâ€™s third marriage, and Mother only met her new husband \r\n  a short period of time before they were married.Â  Second, Mother was held in \r\n  contempt of court for damaging Fatherâ€™s property.Â  Third, the day Mother left \r\n  with the children to Kentucky, it was Fatherâ€™s regularly scheduled visitation \r\n  period.Â  Although Mother sent a letter to Father indicating she was moving, \r\n  Mother, in violation of the divorce decree, failed to give proper notice to \r\n  Father and failed to tell Father where the children would be.Â  \r\nSubsequently, when the family court granted temporary custody \r\n  to Father, Mother did not voluntarily comply with the order.Â  Rather, Father \r\n  had to travel to Kentucky to enforce the order.Â  Furthermore, when Father took \r\n  the children, Mother cried, screamed, and threatened Father in front of the \r\n  children.Â  Mother admitted that after this confrontation, she encouraged the \r\n  children to perform poorly in school so that her chances of retaining permanent \r\n  custody would improve.Â  The children did in fact perform poorly in school, requiring \r\n  one of them to take summer school classes.Â  \r\nConsidering the totality of the circumstances, we conclude \r\n  Father is more capable of providing a stable environment for the children.Â  \r\n  A fair reading of the record indicates while Fatherâ€™s mother tends to many of \r\n  the childrenâ€™s basic needs, Father does involve himself in his childrenâ€™s lives.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, Father has a strong familial support system.Â  We are concerned \r\n  with evidence indicating a history of violent arguments with Mother and Randall.Â  \r\n  The family court noted this history in its order, but ultimately concluded Father \r\n  was still the best parent to have custody.Â  In evaluating the significance of \r\n  this prior history, the family court contrasted, as do we, the evidence within \r\n  the record indicating Mother recently accused her current husband of assaulting \r\n  her with a hammer.Â  Additionally, Mother has demonstrated behavior that indicates \r\n  she prioritizes her own interests over the best interests of her children.Â  \r\n\r\nWe therefore agree with the family courtâ€™s conclusion that \r\n  the best interests of the children are served by granting Father permanent custody.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Expert \r\n  Witness\r\nMother argues the family court erred by excluding \r\n  testimony of a psychologist indicating the children would prefer to live with \r\n  Mother.Â  Mother contends the exclusion of this evidence is in contravention \r\n  of Rule 703, South Carolina Rules of Evidence. \r\n  [1] Â  \r\nIt is well settled the admission and rejection of testimony \r\n  are matters largely within the trial courtâ€™s discretion, the exercise of which, \r\n  absent abuse, will not be disturbed on appeal. Pike v. South Carolina Depâ€™t \r\n  of Transp., 343 S.C. 224, 234, 540 S.E.2d 87, 92 (2000).Â  To warrant reversal, \r\n  the appellant â€œmust show both the error of the ruling and resulting prejudice.â€ \r\n  Recco Tape and Label Co. v. Barfield, 312 S.C. 214, 216, 439 S.E.2d 838, \r\n  840 (1994); Potomac Leasing Co. v. Bone, 294 S.C. 494, 497, 366 S.E.2d \r\n  26, 28 (Ct. App. 1988) (â€œBefore the Court of Appeals will reverse a judgment \r\n  for an alleged error in the exclusion of evidence, the appellant must show prejudice.â€). \r\n\r\nAt the beginning of Motherâ€™s direct examination of \r\n  the psychologist, Mother moved to admit the psychologistâ€™s written evaluation.Â  \r\n  The family court admitted the evaluation into evidence without objection.Â  The \r\n  evaluation generally indicated the children preferred living with their Mother.Â  \r\n\r\nThereafter, Mother asked the psychologist with whom \r\n  the children had indicated they preferred to live.Â  The psychologist indicated \r\n  the children stated they preferred to live with Mother.Â  Father objected and \r\n  moved to strike, and the family court excluded the testimony.Â  \r\nSubsequently, the GAL testified, without objection, \r\n  that the children told him, at least at some specific points during the custody \r\n  litigation, they would prefer to live with Mother. Â \r\nAssuming, without deciding, the family court erred \r\n  by excluding the testimony of the psychologist, the testimonyâ€™s only value was \r\n  to indicate they had expressed a preference to live with Mother, evidence that \r\n  was introduced both through the psychologistâ€™s evaluation and the testimony \r\n  of the GAL.Â Â  Thus, the testimony was cumulative, and its exclusion, if error, \r\n  is not reversible error.Â  See Weir v. Citicorp Nat. Servs., Inc., \r\n  312 S.C. 511, 517, 435 S.E.2d 864, 868 (1993) (holding exclusion of cumulative \r\n  evidence is not prejudicial error). [2] \r\nIII.Â Â Â  Fatherâ€™s \r\n  Acts of Violence\r\nMother argues the family court erred by excluding \r\n  testimony of her older son, Randall, indicating Father was violent.Â  We hold \r\n  the family court did consider the evidence, and thus, Motherâ€™s assignment of \r\n  error is without merit. [3] \r\nAppellate courts should interpret judgments by \r\n  the trial courts as they would any other instrument.Â  Eddins, 304 S.C. \r\n  at 135-36, 403 S.E.2d at 166; see also Evans, 354 S.C. at 584, \r\n  582 S.E.2d at 410 (holding an appellate court must view the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  statements as a whole to determine its reasoning).Â  Thus, the primary objective \r\n  is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the court.Â  Eddins, \r\n  304 S.C. at 135, 403 S.E.2d at 166.Â  However, â€œ[a]n order should be construed \r\n  within the context of the proceeding in which it is rendered.â€Â  Dibble v. \r\n  Sumter Ice and Fuel Co., 283 S.C. 278, 282, 322 S.E.2d 674, 677 (Ct. App. \r\n  1984). \r\nDuring Motherâ€™s direct examination of Randall, Mother attempted \r\n  to introduce testimony indicating in 1991, prior to the divorce decree and original \r\n  custody award, Father displayed violent tendencies both toward her and Randall.Â  \r\n  Father objected, arguing the testimony was not relevant because the alleged \r\n  incidents occurred prior to the divorce decree.Â  \r\nThe family court stated, â€œIf you want to proffer you can.Â  \r\n  But I think Iâ€™m supposed to--- I think Iâ€™m supposed to hear whatâ€™s happened \r\n  since that divorce decree, and I can take into account whatever the court record \r\n  shows.â€Â  Mother then proffered Randallâ€™s testimony.Â  \r\nDuring the proffer, Randall testified that he lived with \r\n  Father from the summer of 1987 until December of 1991.Â  He testified that during \r\n  that time Father was violent.Â  Specifically, he recounted one confrontation \r\n  where Father allegedly threw him to the ground and dented the floor vent with \r\n  his head.Â  He further testified that one month following this confrontation, \r\n  Mother sent him to live with his father in Germany.Â  \r\nSubsequently, Mother ended her proffer and began eliciting \r\n  testimony from Randall for the record.Â  Thereafter, Father asked if the testimony \r\n  was part of the proffer or was testimony for the record.Â  The court replied \r\n  that the testimony was for the record.Â  Furthermore, the court indicated it \r\n  had not yet ruled on whether to admit the previously proffered testimony.Â Â  \r\n\r\nReading the transcript of the hearing, it does not indicate \r\n  if the family court ever ruled, during the hearing, on whether to admit Randallâ€™s \r\n  testimony.Â  However, in the family courtâ€™s order, the court states in its findings \r\n  of fact that:\r\n\r\nHer son himself testified that, when he was 15, he \r\n  had had a confrontation with . . . [Father] which has resulted in the police \r\n  being called and . . . [Father] leaving the house overnight.Â  The incident happened \r\n  sometime in 1992.Â  A few months after that, . . . [Motherâ€™s] older children \r\n  were sent to live with their father in Germany.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nGiven the family courtâ€™s clear, unambiguous language \r\n  in this ruling, the only logical inference is that the family court did consider \r\n  Randallâ€™s testimony.Â  Thus, Motherâ€™s contention to the contrary is without merit.\r\nIV.Â Â Â  Attorneyâ€™s \r\n  Fees\r\nMother argues the family court erred by awarding \r\n  Father attorneyâ€™s fees and not awarding her attorneyâ€™s fees.Â Â  We disagree.\r\nAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees will not be overturned \r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, \r\n  415, 368 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1988).Â  In deciding whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, \r\n  the family court should consider:Â  1) the partiesâ€™ ability to pay their own \r\n  fees; 2) the beneficial results obtained by counsel; 3) the respective financial \r\n  conditions of the parties; and 4) the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard \r\n  of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 \r\n  (1992).Â Â  When determining the amount of fees to award, the family court should \r\n  consider: Â 1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered; 2) \r\n  the time necessarily devoted to the case; 3) counselâ€™s professional standing; \r\n  4) the contingency of compensation; 5) the beneficial results obtained; and \r\n  6) the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, \r\n  304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).Â  \r\nInitially, Mother contends the family court erred \r\n  by awarding Father attorneyâ€™s fees because the court should not have found a \r\n  change of circumstances occurred.Â  Because we hold the family court did not \r\n  err in granting relief based upon a substantial change in circumstances, this \r\n  argument is without merit.\r\nNext, Mother contends the family court erred because \r\n  the order â€œfails to make any of the customary findings required in connection \r\n  with an award of attorneyâ€™s fees, even though it cites Atkinson v. Atkinson, \r\n  279 S.C. 355, 309 S.E.2d 14 (Ct. App. 1983), which defines and requires such \r\n  findings.â€\r\nThe family courtâ€™s eighteen-page order is replete with findings \r\n  involving the respective positions of the parties.Â  In addition, the courtâ€™s \r\n  order noted Fatherâ€™s counselâ€™s professional standing.Â  Furthermore, Fatherâ€™s \r\n  counsel provided an affidavit indicating the time devoted to the case.Â  Moreover, \r\n  it is undisputed that Father obtained a beneficial result based upon the change \r\n  in custody.Â  \r\nFaced with such a detailed order containing extensive findings \r\n  of fact, we conclude Motherâ€™s argument, merely claiming the family court failed \r\n  to make customary findings of fact, is insufficient to preserve this assignment \r\n  of error for appellate review.Â  See Solomon v. City Realty Co., \r\n  262 S.C. 198, 201, 203 S.E.2d 435, 435 (1974) (holding conclusory arguments \r\n  are deemed abandoned); Fields v. Melrose Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 312 S.C. 102, 106, \r\n  439 S.E.2d 283, 285 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding an issue is deemed abandoned and \r\n  thus not presented for appellate review if argued in a short, conclusory statement). \r\n  Â Consequently, Motherâ€™s argument is without merit.\r\nLastly, Mother contends the family court erred \r\n  by not awarding her attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  She contends that the financial disparity \r\n  between the two parties is so great that not awarding her attorneyâ€™s fees is \r\n  an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\nThe evidence within Fatherâ€™s financial declaration \r\n  indicates he has a net monthly income of $2,225.85 and monthly expenses totaling \r\n  $1,855.20.Â  Motherâ€™s financial declaration states she has no monthly income \r\n  and expenses totaling $1,718.00 per month.Â  The Motherâ€™s testimony indicates \r\n  she lacks monthly income because she has a disability.Â  \r\nHowever, the family court did not believe Motherâ€™s \r\n  testimony.Â  Rather, because Mother failed to produce any evidence outside of \r\n  her own testimony indicating she had a disability, the family court imputed \r\n  income to her â€“ a determination Mother has not appealed.Â  Furthermore, Mother \r\n  did not win on the merits.Â  Thus, we hold the family court did not abuse its \r\n  discretion by denying Motherâ€™s motion for attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the decision of the family court \r\n  is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HOWARD, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concurring.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Mother also contends the exclusion contravened Rule 803(3), South \r\n    Carolina Rules of Evidence.Â  However, Mother did not argue Rule 803(3), South \r\n    Carolina Rules of Evidence, to the family court when attempting to admit the \r\n    psychologistâ€™s testimony.Â  Therefore, any argument premised upon that rule \r\n    is not preserved for appellate review.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, \r\n    330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue \r\n    cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to \r\n    and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Mother additionally argues the family court erred by excluding other \r\n    statements made by the children to the psychologist.Â  However, Mother did \r\n    not proffer the psychologistâ€™s testimony.Â  Thus, any assignment of error to \r\n    the exclusion of this testimony is not preserved for appellate review.Â  See \r\n    Greenville Memâ€™l Auditorium v. Martin, 301 S.C. 242, 243, 391 S.E.2d \r\n    546, 547 (1990) (â€œAn alleged erroneous exclusion of evidence is not a basis \r\n    for establishing prejudice on appeal in the absence of an adequate proffer \r\n    of evidence in the court below.â€).Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Mother \r\n    also argues the family court erred by excluding portions of both Fatherâ€™s \r\n    testimony during cross-examination and her own testimony on direct examination.Â  \r\n    However, Fatherâ€™s testimony was not proffered. Thus, any assignment of error \r\n    to the exclusion of this testimony is not preserved for appellate review.Â Â Â Â  \r\n    See Greenville Memâ€™l Auditorium, 301 S.C. at 243, 391 S.E.2d \r\n    at 547 (holding an alleged exclusion of evidence is not a basis for establishing \r\n    prejudice on appeal in the absence of a proffer of the evidence in the court \r\n    below).Â  Furthermore, the substance of Motherâ€™s testimony was admitted though \r\n    the psychologistâ€™s report discussed above.Â  Thus, the testimony was cumulative, \r\n    and its exclusion, if error, is not reversible error.Â  See Weir, \r\n    312 S.C. at 517, 435 S.E.2d at 860 (holding exclusion of cumulative evidence \r\n    is not prejudicial error).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-079","title":"Morgan c.

[1] Â  Following Mother and Fatherâ€™s divorce, Fatherâ€™s \r\n  mother, Martha Ann Bartlett (â€œGrandmotherâ€), received custody of David, with \r\n  Mother having weekend, as well as summer and holiday visitation.Â  \r\nThe divorce decree, in pertinent part, contained the following provisions:Â  \r\n  1) Mother was required to make copies of family pictures and deliver them to \r\n  Father; 2) Mother was required to return several personal videotapes to Father; \r\n  3) Mother, Father, and Grandmother were enjoined from harassing one another; \r\n  4) Mother could speak with David over the telephone; however, Mother was prohibited \r\n  from initiating telephone contact with David; 5) Mother was required to provide \r\n  Grandmother with a calendar of Motherâ€™s work schedule six months in advance; \r\n  and 6) Mother was encouraged not to reside with paramours overnight during her \r\n  visitations with David.Â  \r\nFollowing the decree, Grandmother and \r\n  Father each filed rules to show cause, alleging Mother violated the divorce \r\n  decree. Specifically, Grandmother alleged Mother was in contempt for: 1) initiating \r\n  telephone calls with David; 2) failing to provide a calendar of her work schedule \r\n  six months in advance; and 3) continuing to reside with her paramour during \r\n  visitations with David. Grandmother requested Motherâ€™s visitation be restricted \r\n  and requested Mother pay an additional twenty-five dollars per week for Davidâ€™s \r\n  tutoring. Fatherâ€™s complaint alleged Mother was in contempt for failing to make \r\n  copies of the family pictures and return his personal videotapes. \r\nThe family courtâ€™s order found Mother in contempt \r\n  for failing to:Â  1) make copies of the family pictures; 2); return Fatherâ€™s \r\n  personal videotapes; and 3) provide Grandmother with a calendar of her work \r\n  schedule six months in advance.Â  Furthermore, while holding Mother was not in \r\n  contempt of the divorce decree for exposing David to her paramour, the family \r\n  court modified the divorce decree, altering Motherâ€™s visitation schedule and \r\n  restricting Davidâ€™s visitation with Mother to daytime hours.Â  Additionally, \r\n  the order required Mother to pay one-half of all Davidâ€™s tutoring bills.Â  Mother \r\n  appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has \r\n  the authority to find facts in accordance with its view of the evidence.Â  Rutherford \r\n  v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).Â  This broad \r\n  scope of review does not, however, require this court to disregard the findings \r\n  of the family court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 \r\n  S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Contempt\r\nMother argues the family court erred \r\n  by holding her in contempt for failing to:Â  1) make copies of family pictures \r\n  and provide them to Father; 2) return Fatherâ€™s personal videotapes; and 3) provide \r\n  Grandmother with her work schedule six months in advance.Â  We deem these issues \r\n  abandoned.\r\nâ€œ[S]hort, conclusory statements made \r\n  without supporting authority are deemed abandoned on appeal and therefore not \r\n  presented for review.â€Â  Glasscock, Inc. v. U.S. Fidelity and Guar. Co., \r\n  348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d 689, 691 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nMotherâ€™s brief contains little discussion as to \r\n  the issues on appeal and no citation to authority.Â  Thus, we deem these issues \r\n  as abandoned.Â  See Glasscock, Inc., 348 S.C. at 83, 557 S.E.2d \r\n  at 691. [2] Â  \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Visitation\r\nMother argues this Court \r\n  should modify the family courtâ€™s visitation award because, subsequent to the \r\n  family courtâ€™s order, she married the paramour.Â  This issue is not properly \r\n  before us.\r\nInitially, we note, \r\n  Mother has not argued the family court abused its discretion by altering her \r\n  visitation award.Â  Thus, the only issue presented is whether this Court should \r\n  find Motherâ€™s circumstances have changed such that her visitation award should \r\n  be modified.\r\nFor a court to modify \r\n  an existing custody or visitation award, there must be a showing of changed \r\n  circumstances occurring subsequent to the entry of the decree.Â  Heckle v. \r\n  Heckle, 266 S.C. 355, 358, 223 S.E.2d 590, 591 (1976).Â  However, a motion \r\n  to modify a custody or visitation award based on a change in circumstances cannot \r\n  be made, at the first instance, to this Court.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  14-8-200(a) (Supp. 2002) (stating the Court of Appealsâ€™ jurisdiction is limited \r\n  to appellate jurisdiction).Â  Rather, the motion must be made in the family court.Â  \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-400(A)(1)(e) (1985) (stating the family court \r\n  has original jurisdiction over claims of child custody); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(30) \r\n  (Supp. 2002) (â€œThe family court shall have exclusive jurisdiction:Â  [t]o hear \r\n  and determine any questions of support, custody, separation, or any other matter \r\n  over which the court has jurisdiction, without the intervention of a jury . \r\n  . . .â€).\r\nIn Grandmotherâ€™s rule to show cause, Grandmother argued \r\n  Mother was in contempt of the divorce decree for residing overnight with the \r\n  paramour during her visitations with David.&nbsp; The family court ruled the \r\n  divorce decree only recommended Mother not reside with paramours during her \r\n  visitations with David.&nbsp; Thus, the family court did not hold Mother in \r\n  contempt.&nbsp; However, the family court ruled the best interests of David \r\n  would be served by altering Motherâ€™s visitation award and restricting Motherâ€™s \r\n  visitation with David to daylight hours.&nbsp;\r\nSubsequently, Mother married the paramour.&nbsp; \r\n  However, no evidence exists within the record indicating Mother either planned \r\n  to marry the paramour prior to the modification or discussed the possibility \r\n  with the family court.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMother claims her marriage to \r\n  the paramour is a change of circumstances warranting a visitation modification.&nbsp; \r\n  However,&nbsp;her claim is not properly before this Court.Â  See S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 14-8-200(1) (stating the Court of Appealsâ€™ jurisdiction is limited \r\n  to appellate jurisdiction).&nbsp; Rather, this claim must first be brought before \r\n  the family court.&nbsp; Thus, Motherâ€™s remedy, if any, is to petition the family \r\n  court for modification of its order.&nbsp; Accordingly, this portion of the&nbsp;appeal \r\n  is dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Tutoring\r\nMother argues the family court \r\n  erred by ordering her to pay one-half of Davidâ€™s tutoring bills because she \r\n  is capable of tutoring David, and thus, third party tutors are unneeded.Â  We \r\n  disagree.\r\nIn all determinations \r\n  involving children, the best interests of the children are the paramount concern.Â  \r\n  See e.g.Â  Cook v. Cobb, 271 S.C. 136, 140, 245 S.E.2d 612, 614 \r\n  (1978) (â€œThe welfare of the child and what is in his/her best interest is the \r\n  primary, paramount and controlling consideration of the court in all child custody \r\n  controversies.â€);Â  Ex Parte Stull, 276 S.C. 512, 513, 280 S.E.2d 209, \r\n  210 (1981) (holding in deciding whether to allow a change in a childâ€™s surname, \r\n  the family court should grant the request only if the change promotes the childâ€™s \r\n  best interests and welfare);Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Vanderhorst, \r\n  287 S.C. 554, 561, 340 S.E.2d 149, 153 (1986) (holding in proceedings to terminate \r\n  parental rights, the paramount concern is the best interests of the child).\r\nIn Grandmotherâ€™s rule \r\n  to show cause, she asserts David needs tutoring.Â  To support her position, Grandmother \r\n  testified David was having difficulty in school, and his school requested he \r\n  receive at least two hours of tutoring a week. Grandmother further testified \r\n  Davidâ€™s school provided her with a list of qualified tutors, and the hourly \r\n  rate for the tutors is twenty-five dollars. \r\nInitially, we note, Mother does \r\n  not dispute David needs tutoring.Â  Furthermore, Mother does not argue that she \r\n  should not be required to contribute to Davidâ€™s tutoring because she is without \r\n  financial means.Â  Rather, Mother only asserts she is capable of tutoring David, \r\n  and thus, third party tutors are unneeded.\r\nAlthough the record indicates \r\n  Mother has the equivalent of a high school diploma and has completed some college \r\n  work at Spartanburg Technical College, no evidence exists within the record \r\n  indicating Mother is a qualified tutor or that she has experience tutoring children.Â  \r\n  Thus, given the testimony of Grandmother, we agree with the family court that \r\n  Davidâ€™s best interests are served by having him tutored by qualified individuals \r\n  as recommended by his school.Â Â Â  Consequently, the family court did not err.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the \r\n  family courtâ€™s order, and DISMISS Motherâ€™s motion to modify her visitation \r\n  award.Â \r\nHEARN, C.J., HOWARD, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concurring.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Ashley reached the age of majority prior to Mother and Fatherâ€™s divorce.Â  \r\n    Thus, Ashley was not a subject of the custody award.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Motherâ€™s entire brief fails to cite authority for her arguments.Â  \r\n    Thus, generally we would deem all of her issues as abandoned on appeal.Â  However, \r\n    given this Courtâ€™s duty to zealously guard the rights of minors, we will address \r\n    the merits of the Motherâ€™s arguments to the extent they involve the best interests \r\n    of David. See Joiner ex rel. Rivas v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 107, \r\n    536 S.E.2d 372, 374 (2000) (stating â€œprocedural rules are subservient to the \r\n    courtâ€™s duty to zealously guard the rights of minorsâ€); Ex parte Roper, \r\n    254 S.C. 558, 563, 176 S.E.2d 175, 177 (1970) (holding â€œwhere the rights and \r\n    best interests of a minor child are concerned, the court may appropriately \r\n    raise, ex mero motu, issues not raised by the partiesâ€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-080","title":"State v.

Hagler, of Columbia, \r\n  for Appellant,\r\nAttorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, \r\n  of Columbia; and Solicitor Robert M. Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  A jury found Kenneth Bernard \r\n  Scott guilty of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, possession \r\n  of cocaine with intent to distribute within close proximity of a school, trafficking \r\n  in crack cocaine, and possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute \r\n  within close proximity of a school. He was fined $50,000 and received concurrent \r\n  sentences on the four charges, the longest of which was for 21 years. \r\n  [1] Â  On appeal, Scottâ€™s counsel argues that the trial court erred in failing \r\n  to grant his motion for directed verdict on the charges.Â  In a response brief, \r\n  Scott raises eight issues dealing with subject matter jurisdiction, violations \r\n  of his Constitutional rights, and evidence suppression.Â  We dismiss Scottâ€™s \r\n  appeal and grant counselâ€™s petition to be relieved.\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nWhile conducting a midnight search \r\n  of Scottâ€™s fatherâ€™s home pursuant to a valid search warrant based on a confidential \r\n  informantâ€™s information, Sheriffâ€™s Department investigators found Scott standing \r\n  fully dressed and alone over a toilet in a bathroom in the home.Â  Someone had \r\n  apparently just tried to flush the toilet, because water was swirling in it.Â  \r\n  An officer removed Scott from the bathroom and handcuffed him.Â  Another officer \r\n  found a bag containing crack cocaine in the toilet and a bag containing cocaine \r\n  on the floor where Scott had been found.Â  Investigating officers also found \r\n  Scottâ€™s father in a bedroom, and another man sitting in the kitchen.Â  was subsequently \r\n  indicted for one count each of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, \r\n  possession of cocaine with intent to distribute within close proximity of a \r\n  school, trafficking in crack cocaine, and possession of crack cocaine with intent \r\n  to distribute within close proximity of a school.Â  \r\nIn a September 2000 trial, the State provided testimony \r\n  from six law enforcement officials who investigated the crime scene where Scott \r\n  was arrested.Â  Their testimony indicated that when law enforcement entered and \r\n  secured Scottâ€™s fatherâ€™s house, they found Scottâ€™s father in bedroom, another \r\n  man in the kitchen, and Scott in the bathroom with the illegal drugs.Â  At the \r\n  conclusion of the Stateâ€™s case, Scott made a motion for directed verdict based \r\n  on a claim that the evidence was insufficient to support the charges.Â  Specifically, \r\n  Scott maintained that the office did not see drugs in the bathroom where Scott \r\n  was found until Scott had been removed and secured, and that Scottâ€™s â€œmere presenceâ€ \r\n  alone was not enough to support the pending charges.Â  The trial court denied \r\n  the motion, finding sufficient circumstantial evidence existed to submit the \r\n  case to the jury.Â  Scott renewed the motion after all evidence was presented.Â  \r\n\r\nScott later filed a motion to reconsider his sentence, \r\n  for which the circuit judge held a hearing on April 21, 2001.Â  The judge issued \r\n  a written order three days later stating â€œMotion for Reconsideration of Sentence \r\n  in this case is respectfully denied.â€Â  This appeal follows.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  ANDERS ISSUE\r\nScott contends that the trial court \r\n  erred in failing to grant his motion for directed verdict because he never had \r\n  actual or constructive possession of the drugs.Â  Specifically, Scott argues \r\n  that he had no actual possession of the drugs, and the evidence only suggests \r\n  his â€œmere presenceâ€ where the drugs were found rather than constructive possession \r\n  of the drugs.Â  Consequently, he concludes his state and federal due process \r\n  rights were violated.\r\nâ€œConviction of possession requires proof of possession, \r\n  either actual or constructive, coupled with knowledge of the drug's presence.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Williams, 346 S.C. 424, 430, 552 S.E.2d 54, 57 (2001). â€œActual \r\n  possession occurs when the drugs are found to be in the actual physical custody \r\n  of the person charged with possession.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œIn order to prove constructive \r\n  possession, the State must show the defendant had dominion and control, or the \r\n  right to exercise dominion and control, over the drug.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œSuch possession \r\n  can be established by circumstantial or direct evidence or a combination of \r\n  the two.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œPossession requires more than mere presence. The State \r\n  must show the defendant had dominion or control over the thing allegedly possessed \r\n  or had the right to exercise dominion or control over it.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œWhere \r\n  contraband materials are found on premises under the control of the accused, \r\n  this fact in and of itself gives rise to an inference of knowledge and possession \r\n  which may be sufficient to carry the case to the jury.â€Â  Id.\r\nIn the present case, testimony from law enforcement \r\n  officers clearly indicated that ScottÂ  was alone in the restroom where the drugs \r\n  were located, thus giving him dominion over the drugs.Â  Accordingly, when viewed \r\n  in the light most favorable to State, the circumstantial evidence in this case \r\n  at least reasonably tends to prove Scottâ€™s guilt on the possession charges.Â  \r\n  Thus, the trial court did not err in denying his motion for directed verdict.Â  \r\n  See State v. Cooper, 334 SC 540, 551-52, 514 S.E.2d 584, 590 (1999) \r\n  (stating that â€œ[i]n reviewing the denial of a motion for a directed verdict, \r\n  the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the State, and if \r\n  there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably \r\n  tending to prove the guilt of the accused, an appellate court must find that \r\n  the case was properly submitted to the jury.â€)\r\nIII.Â Â Â  PRO SE RESPONSE ISSUES\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A.Â Â Â Â Â  Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\nScott argues that the court of appeals \r\n  lacks subject matter jurisdiction because he never received written notice or \r\n  an order granting or denying his Post-Trial motions.Â  He also argues that the \r\n  circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because he (1) was never served \r\n  the charging instruments; (2) the indictments for distributing controlled substances \r\n  within the proximity of a school were invalid because â€œGreenville Tech is not \r\n  a public vocational or trade school or technical education center;â€ and (3) \r\n  the indictments were not filed with the Greenville County Clerk of Court.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Subject Matter Jurisdiction \r\n  of the Court of Appeals\r\nScott claims that he was never provided \r\n  a written order denying his post-trial motion for a new trial, this court lacks \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction to consider the appeal because the matter is stayed \r\n  pending his receipt of a written order expressing the trial courtâ€™s ruling on \r\n  his post-trial motion.Â  We disagree.\r\nScott bases his claim on Rule 29, SCRCrimP, which \r\n  partially provides that â€œ[t]he time for appeal for all parties shall be stayed \r\n  by a timely post trial (sic) motion and shall run from the receipt of written \r\n  notice of entry of the order granting or denying such motion.â€Â  However, the \r\n  court in this matter clearly issued a written order denying Scottâ€™s post-trial \r\n  motion, and filed the Motion in the Office of the Greenville County Clerk of \r\n  Court.Â  Moreover, Scottâ€™s counsel filed a notice of intent to appeal on May \r\n  3, 2002, which gave the South Carolina Court of Appeals exclusive jurisdiction \r\n  over the appeal and divested the lower courtâ€™s jurisdiction except to entertain \r\n  petitions for writs of supersedeas.Â  See Rule 205, SCACR (stating â€œ[u]pon \r\n  the service of the notice of appeal, the appellate court shall have exclusive \r\n  jurisdiction over the appeal;Â  the lower court shall have jurisdiction to entertain \r\n  petitions for writs of supersedeas as provided by Rule 225.â€)Â Â  Thus, we find \r\n  Scottâ€™s contention that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over his \r\n  appeal is meritless.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Subject Matter Jurisdiction \r\n  of the Circuit Court\r\nScott contends the circuit court lacked \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction to hear his case because he had never been served \r\n  with the indictments.Â  However, in his appearance before the court, he never \r\n  mentioned that he had not received the indictments.Â  Additionally, his appearance \r\n  at the trial, along with the inclusion of the indictments in the record on appeal, \r\n  suggests he received the indictments contrary to his assertions.\r\nHe next argues that the trial court lacked \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction to hear charges pertaining to distribution with \r\n  proximity of a school because â€œGreenville Tech is a private vocational trade \r\n  schoolâ€ to which S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-445 does not apply. [2] Â  However, we take judicial notice of the fact \r\n  that Greenville Technical College is a state-supported, and thus public, â€œtechnical \r\n  education centerâ€ to which Section 44-53-445 clearly applies. \r\n  [3] \r\nFinally, Scott contends that the indictments \r\n  have not been filed with the Greenville County Clerk of Court, so the circuit \r\n  court there lacked jurisdiction to â€œentertain his case and sentence him.â€Â  However, \r\n  the record contains certified copies of the indictments that were provided by \r\n  the Greenville County Clerk of Court, suggesting that office has filed copies \r\n  of the indictments.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  B.Â Â Â Â Â  Constitutional Violations\r\nScott maintains that his Constitutional \r\n  rights were violated (1) by the admission of prejudicial hearsay evidence related \r\n  to the confidential informant; (2) by the courtâ€™s failure to suppress evidence \r\n  obtained from a search conducted without compliance with â€œknock and announceâ€ \r\n  requirements; (3) because he was arrested without probable cause; and (4) by \r\n  holding him in violation of his Fourteenth Amendment rights where â€œno \r\n  rational trial of fact would find [him] guilty of every fact and element of \r\n  his charges beyond a reasonable doubt.â€Â  However, he never raised the first \r\n  three issues at trial.Â  Thus, they are not preserved for our review.Â  See \r\n  State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 380, 580 S.E.2d 785, 795 (Ct. App. 2003) \r\n  (stating â€œ[a]rguments not raised to or ruled upon by the trial court are not \r\n  preserved for appellate review.â€); State v. Varvil, 338 S.C. 335, 339, \r\n  526 S.E.2d 248, 250 (Ct. App. 2000) (stating â€œConstitutional arguments are no \r\n  exception to the rule, and if not raised to the trial court are deemed waived \r\n  on appeal.â€)Â  We find the merits of the fourth issue are so closely akin to \r\n  those of the directed verdict motion, and find no violation of his Fourteenth \r\n  Amendment rights accordingly.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAfter a review of the record as required by Anders \r\n  v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), and State v. Williams, 305 S.C. \r\n  116, 406 S.E.2d 357 (1991),Â  and the forgoing reasons, we hold there are no \r\n  directly appealable issues that are arguable on their merits.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we dismiss Scottâ€™s appeal and grant counselâ€™s petition to be relieved.\r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HOWARD, and KITTREDGE, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Scott received credit for time served.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  S.C.

Epps, Jr., of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Tommy David Bonner (Husband) appeals \r\n  from the family courtâ€™s denial of his motion seeking a new trial or relief from \r\n  the Final Divorce Decree, pursuant to Rule 59 [1]  and Rule 60 [2] , SCRCP.Â  Husband appeals, asserting that his attorney abandoned \r\n  the case.Â  He alleges the family court erred in ruling that the neglect of the \r\n  attorney is attributable to him.Â  We disagree and affirm.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband filed a divorce action on \r\n  January 12, 2001 and Wife counterclaimed on February 20, 2001.Â  Husband released \r\n  his initial attorney, Mr. Ronnie Treadwell, on October 9, 2001 and retained \r\n  Mr. Harold Lowery on the same day to represent him.Â  It appears Husband paid \r\n  Mr. Lowery $500 and thereafter made subsequent payments.Â  Mr. Lowery never notified \r\n  Wifeâ€™s attorney or the court that he represented Husband.Â  The final hearing \r\n  was rescheduled for September 12, 2002 and subsequently continued to November \r\n  21, 2002.Â  After an extended illness, which was well known in the Anderson County \r\n  Bar, Mr. Lowery died on November 3, 2002.Â  Wifeâ€™s attorney mailed notification \r\n  of the final hearing to Husbandâ€™s last known address.Â  Husband contends that \r\n  he never received notification.Â  \r\nThe case was tried before Family Court Judge \r\n  Barry W. Knobel on November 21, 2002.Â  Wife was present with her attorney.Â  \r\n  Husband was not present.Â  The family issued a final decree and granted Wife \r\n  relief pursuant to her counterclaim.Â  Husband filed a Motion for New Trial or \r\n  Relief from Judgment, pursuant to Rules 59 and 60, SCRCP, respectively. Â Judge \r\n  Knobel denied the motion, finding that Husband failed to establish any excusable \r\n  neglect or inadvertence that would entitle him to the relief requested in his \r\n  motion.Â  This appeal follows.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nThe grant or denial of new trial motions rests within \r\n  the discretion of the trial judge, and the decision will not be disturbed on \r\n  appeal unless the findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence or the conclusions \r\n  reached are controlled by error of law.Â  Vinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C. \r\n  389, 405, 477 S.E.2d 715, 723 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œ[M]otions for relief under \r\n  Rule 60(b) are addressed to the discretion of the court and appellate review \r\n  is limited to determining whether the trial court abused its discretion.â€Â  Saro \r\n  Invs. v. Ocean Holiday Pâ€™ship, 314 S.C. 116, 124, 441 S.E.2d 835, 840 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1994).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHusband alleges the family court erred in ruling that \r\n  the neglect of the attorney is attributable to the client, and argues on appeal \r\n  that Mr. Lowery abandoned the case.Â  Assuming the issue of abandonment was properly \r\n  raised in the trial court, we disagree.Â  \r\nGenerally, â€œthe mistake inadvertence or neglect of \r\n  counsel has been held insufficient grounds for relief where default results \r\n  from inaction of counsel on behalf of the client or failure to exercise due \r\n  diligence in the protection of the clientâ€™s interest.â€Â  Lee v. Peek, \r\n  240 S.C. 203, 125 S.E.2d 353, 358 (1962). Â However, where there has been a finding \r\n  of willful and unilateral abandonment, the rule does not apply, and relief may \r\n  be granted to the party.Â  Graham v. Town of Loris, 272 S.C. 442, 452, \r\n  248 S.E.2d 594, 599 (1978).Â  In Goodson v. American Bankers Ins. Co. of Florida, \r\n  295 S.C. 400, 403, 368 S.E.2d 687, 689 (Ct. App. 1988), the court held that \r\n  â€œa party has a duty to monitor the progress of his case.Â  Lack of familiarity \r\n  with legal proceedings is unacceptable and the court will not hold a layman \r\n  to any lesser standard than is applied to an attorney.â€Â  \r\nIn light of the fact that Husband was the party who \r\n  had commenced the litigation, there was an obligation on his part to monitor \r\n  the status of his case.Â  There is no indication from the record that he took \r\n  any responsibility or attempted to do so.Â  Husbandâ€™s inaction is highlighted \r\n  by the unchallenged finding of the trial court regarding Mr. Loweryâ€™s extended illness.Â  Certainly, had Husband demonstrated any degree of \r\n  diligence concerning his case and its status, he would have learned of Mr. Loweryâ€™s \r\n  illness and inability to represent Husband well prior to the scheduled final \r\n  hearing.Â  Such readily available knowledge would have prompted a reasonable \r\n  person to take appropriate steps to ensure representation by counsel.Â  Moreover, \r\n  Mr. Lowery died approximately three weeks prior to the final hearing, and during \r\n  that time period, Husband offers no explanation why he failed to take any action, \r\n  such as contacting Mr. Loweryâ€™s office, to protect his legal interest.Â  Therefore, \r\n  based on the totality of the circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its \r\n  discretion in finding that Husband failed to establish excusable neglect or \r\n  inadvertence that would entitle him to relief.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HOWARD, and KITTREDGE, J.J., concur.Â  Â \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   [1] Â  Rule 59(a), SCRCP, states:Â  â€œA new trial may be granted to all or \r\n    any of the parties and on all or part of the issues . . . (2) in an action \r\n    tried without a jury, for any of the reasons for which rehearings have heretofore \r\n    been granted in the courts of the State.Â  On a motion for a new trial in an \r\n    action tried without a jury, the court may open the judgment if one has been \r\n    entered, take additional testimony, amend findings of fact and conclusions \r\n    of law or make new findings and conclusions, and direct the entry of a new \r\n    judgment.â€Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n   [2] Â  Rule 60(b), SCRCP, states:Â  â€œOn motion and upon such terms as are \r\n    just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final \r\n    judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, \r\n    surprise, or excusable neglect . . . .â€Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-093","title":"State v.

Slocumb, 336 S.C. 619, 626-27, 521 S.E.2d \r\n  507, 511 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the circuit judgeâ€™s \r\n  decision is unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.Â Â  \r\n  State v. Lopez, 352 S.C. 373, 378, 574 S.E.2d 210, 212 (2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMartin contends that the circuit court erred in \r\n  refusing to allow him to testify at his own incompetency hearing on the basis \r\n  that Martinâ€™s testimony would be â€œbiased.â€Â  However, we find nothing in the \r\n  record suggesting bias was a concern of the circuit court, much less a basis \r\n  for its refusal to permit Martin to testify.Â  Instead, we find the circuit court \r\n  based its ruling on concerns for avoiding a â€œdelay tacticâ€ and obtaining evidence \r\n  cumulative to that provided by Martinâ€™s own expert witness.Â  Martinâ€™s \r\n  attorney sought Martinâ€™s testimony not to introduce new evidence, but rather \r\n  to allow the circuit court to â€œhave firsthand knowledge â€¦ on Anthony Martinâ€™s \r\n  response or lack of responses to those same questions [posed by the experts].â€Â  \r\n  (emphasis added).Â  Martinâ€™s attorney noted the circuit court would be â€œbetter \r\n  servedâ€ by allowing Martinâ€™s testimony.\r\nWhile we tend to agree with Martinâ€™s attorney, \r\n  we are not inclined to find, on this record, an abuse of discretion in refusing \r\n  Martinâ€™s testimony.Â  The circuit court had conducted two competency hearings.Â  \r\n  The judge observed, â€œIâ€™ve heard from Dr. Dewitt twice, Iâ€™ve heard from Dr. Crawford \r\n  and Dr. Shea â€¦ I kept real good notes. And to me, it would make no sense whatsoever \r\n  for you to put your defendant on the stand, for him to do the same thing heâ€™s \r\n  done to your psychiatrist for the last year, to convince me heâ€™s not competent \r\n  to stand trial â€¦.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  Under those circumstances, where \r\n  the proposed testimony was merely to provide the circuit court with a â€œfirsthandâ€ \r\n  observation of Martinâ€™s responses to the same questions posed by the various \r\n  experts, we find that the circuit court acted within its broad discretion in \r\n  refusing the testimony.\r\nMartinâ€™s final assignment of error is the claim \r\n  that the circuit court held that its decision regarding competence could only \r\n  be based on expert testimony.Â  It is true that the circuit court initially provided \r\n  its rationale for refusing to permit Martinâ€™s testimony on this basis, but the \r\n  circuit court subsequently acknowledged that the determination of competency \r\n  is not confined to expert testimony. Martinâ€™s attorney stated, â€œExpert testimony \r\n  is not the only testimony his Honor can consider for purposes of determining \r\n  whether or not a defendant is competent to stand trialâ€ and the circuit court \r\n  responded:Â  â€œI know.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  Martin, in essence, assigns \r\n  a holding to the circuit court that the circuit court rejected.Â  The circuit \r\n  court acknowledged that a competency determination is not limited to \r\n  expert testimony, but declined Martinâ€™s testimony for the reasons discussed \r\n  above.Â  Thus, this ground provides no basis for relief.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the forgoing reasons, the decision of the circuit court \r\n  is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HOWARD and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-097","title":"Patel v.

Jay Haar, of Surfside Beach, for Appellant.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nWilliam W. DesChamps, Jr., of Myrtle Beach, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This is an action for the collection \r\n  of an indebtedness in the sum of $200,000.Â  Ghanshyam â€œDannyâ€ Patel brought \r\n  this action against Vinod Patel, alleging breach of contract, breach of contract \r\n  accompanied by fraudulent act, constructive fraud, conversion, fraud and deceit \r\n  based upon misrepresentation, and negligent misrepresentation.Â  The master-in-equity \r\n  ruled in favor of Danny.Â  Vinod appeals, arguing a resulting trust theory.Â  \r\n  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nDanny has owned and operated motels \r\n  in the Myrtle Beach area since 1980.Â  Vinod is in the business of constructing \r\n  and owning motels and is a thirty-five percent shareholder in Classic Investment, \r\n  Inc., a South Carolina Corporation.Â Â  \r\nIn January 1998, Classic purchased \r\n  unimproved real property in Surfside Beach for $500,000.Â  Vinod and Danny each \r\n  advanced $250,000 to Classic to enable Classic to purchase the property.Â  The \r\n  $250,000 loan from Danny to Classic was evidenced by a promissory note from \r\n  Classic in favor of Danny.Â  Classicâ€™s statement of assets, liabilities, and \r\n  stockholdersâ€™ equity as of December 1999 showed a land value of $500,000.Â  After \r\n  Classic purchased the property, it obtained a construction loan to build the \r\n  motel, and each of the shareholders guaranteed the loan.Â  Classic also entered \r\n  into a franchise agreement with Comfort Inn â€“ the shareholders personally guarantying \r\n  the obligations.Â  Danny was never a guarantor of any franchise obligation or \r\n  construction loan. \r\nBy 2000, Danny had advanced the total \r\n  principal sum of $575,000 to Vinod and Classic.Â  Classic received $375,000 and \r\n  Vinod received $200,000, pursuant to Vinodâ€™s request and for use in constructing \r\n  the motel.Â  Danny testified that this $200,000 was independent of the $250,000 \r\n  he advanced to Classic in January 1998.Â  In the confession of judgment, Classic \r\n  admitted liability to Danny for the $375,000.Â  In addition, the Final Order \r\n  and Judgment of Sale and Foreclosure confirmed the $375,000 indebtedness of \r\n  Classic in favor of Danny.Â  This $375,000 indebtedness includes the $250,000 \r\n  advance Danny made to Classic in January 1998.\r\nAlthough Classic admitted liability to Danny for \r\n  the $375,000, when Danny demanded payment from Vinod for his $200,000 indebtedness, \r\n  Vinod refused.Â  Danny brought this action alleging breach of contract, breach \r\n  of contract accompanied by fraudulent act, constructive fraud, conversion, fraud \r\n  and deceit based upon misrepresentations, and negligent misrepresentation.Â  \r\n  At the April 24, 2002 hearing, the master-in-equity ruled in favor of Danny \r\n  and awarded judgment in the amount of $200,000 plus pre-judgment interest at \r\n  the legal rate of 8Â¾% from January 7, 2000 to the date of the order and post-judgment \r\n  interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of judgment until paid.Â  \r\n  Vinod appeals, arguing the master erred in failing to find a resulting trust \r\n  was created in which title to the property would be conveyed from Classic to \r\n  Danny upon completion of the motel.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAlthough an action to determine a resulting trust sounds in equity, \r\n  Vinodâ€™s resulting trust defense is based on an alleged contract between Classic \r\n  and Danny for the reconveyance of Classicâ€™s property.Â  Because an action on \r\n  a contract is one at law, this action is at law.Â  Therefore, we may only correct \r\n  errors of law and we are bound to uphold the masterâ€™s findings of fact unless \r\n  there is no evidence that reasonably supports them.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. \r\n  v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nVinod argues the $200,000 he received from Danny \r\n  was not a loan, but partial repayment for the $250,000 sum he allegedly advanced \r\n  on behalf of Danny to purchase the motel property in January 1998.Â  He contends \r\n  Danny wanted to purchase the property, but could only come up with half of the \r\n  purchase price; therefore, he provided the other half of the purchase price \r\n  as a loan to Danny.Â  As a result, he claims the trial court erred in failing \r\n  to find a resulting trust was created between him and Danny when he allegedly \r\n  advanced $250,000 to Danny and agreed to convey the property to Danny at a later \r\n  date.Â  \r\nIn asserting his resulting trust theory, Vinod \r\n  claims that title to the land was placed in the name of Classic for Dannyâ€™s \r\n  benefit.Â  We disagree and find the evidence shows Vinod and Danny each advanced \r\n  $250,000 to Classic to enable Classic to purchase the real property.Â  \r\n  A party attempting to prove the existence of a resulting trust in real property \r\n  must show by clear, definite, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the \r\n  beneficiary of the trust paid a portion of the purchase money at the time of \r\n  the transaction.Â  Glover v. Glover, 268 S.C. 433, 435, 234 S.E.2d 488, \r\n  489 (1977).Â  Vinod failed to meet this burden of proof.Â  He did not prove by \r\n  definite, clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the $250,000 Danny \r\n  advanced to Classic in January 1998 was partial payment for the real property, \r\n  instead of a loan to Classic.Â  The promissory note, confession of judgment, \r\n  and final order all document that the $250,000 Danny advanced to Classic in \r\n  January 1998 was a loan from Danny to Classic.Â  The promissory note, a written \r\n  contract, is binding against a claimed contemporaneous oral agreement that would \r\n  modify or vary it.Â  Ray v. South Carolina Natâ€™l Bank, Inc., 281 S.C. \r\n  170, 173, 314 S.E.2d 359, 361 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Therefore, the written promissory \r\n  note, and the other written evidence, is controlling over Vinodâ€™s alleged oral \r\n  agreement.Â  \r\nVinod alleges he intended for Classic to convey \r\n  its property and assets of Classic to Danny at a later date for a price to be \r\n  agreed upon.Â  However, for a resulting trust to be created, the beneficiary \r\n  of the trust, Danny, was required to pay the monies at the time of the purchase \r\n  of the property, not at some unspecified future date.Â  Glover, 268 S.C. \r\n  at 435, 234 S.E.2d at 489.Â  In addition, to form a binding contract, there must \r\n  be mutual manifestation of assent between the parties as to the contract terms, \r\n  and certain terms, such as price, time, and place, are indispensable and must \r\n  be set out with reasonable certainty.Â  McPeters v. Yeargin Constr. Co., \r\n  290 S.C. 327, 331, 350 S.E.2d 208, 211 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  If a contract does \r\n  not fix a definite price term, there must be a definite method for ascertaining \r\n  it.Â  Id.Â  Therefore, in the present case, because the alleged agreement \r\n  for Classic to convey its property to Danny did not specify a date, price, or \r\n  a method for ascertaining the price, it is not binding and is unenforceable.Â  \r\n\r\nWe find sufficient evidence establishing an express \r\n  contract between Danny and Classic for a $250,000 loan.Â  However, even if the \r\n  promissory note, confession of judgment, and final order did not document this \r\n  express contract, we find the evidence shows the existence of an implied contract \r\n  for repayment.Â  To have a contract implied by law, there must be a benefit conferred \r\n  to a party, a realization of that benefit, and an inequitable retention of the \r\n  benefit.Â  Myrtle Beach Hosp. Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 333 S.C. 590, \r\n  596, 510 S.E.2d 439, 442 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Danny conferred a benefit of $200,000 \r\n  to Vinod.Â  Vinod realized that benefit by receiving and depositing the money \r\n  into his account.Â  Vinod unjustifiably retained the $200,000 without conveying \r\n  to Danny any valuable consideration.Â  Implied contracts are similar to restitution, \r\n  which permits recovery of that amount the defendant has been benefited at the \r\n  expense of the plaintiff in order to preclude unjust enrichment.Â  Costa &amp; \r\n  Sons Constr. Co. v. Long, 306 S.C. 465, 468, 412 S.E.2d 450, 452 (Ct. App. \r\n  1991).Â  Based on an implied contract theory, Danny should recover the $200,000 \r\n  consideration he paid to Vinod.\r\nAs Vinod has not appealed the trial courtâ€™s findings \r\n  regarding the interest to be awarded on the $200,000, the trial courtâ€™s findings \r\n  are the law of the case.Â  First Union Natâ€™l Bank of South Carolina v. Soden, \r\n  333 S.C. 554, 556, 511 S.E.2d 372, 378 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Therefore, we affirm \r\n  the award of pre-judgment and post-judgment interest.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the above, we find no error of law by \r\n  the trial judge.Â  Vinodâ€™s resulting trust defense is unsubstantiated.Â  All the \r\n  evidence establishes the $250,000 Danny advanced to Classic in January 1998 \r\n  was a loan, and no binding contract existed for conveying Classicâ€™s assets to \r\n  Danny.Â  Thus, the $200,000 Danny gave to Vinod was not repayment of a loan, \r\n  but was a loan to Vinod; hence, Danny is entitled to collect the $200,000 from \r\n  Vinod.Â  Therefore, the order of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., ANDERSON and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-098","title":"Smoak v.

Lang, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; Frances S. \r\n  Smoak brought this suit against an adjoining landowner, Terry McCullough, to \r\n  settle a boundary dispute.Â  The master-in-equity dismissed the suit, ruling \r\n  insufficient evidence existed within the record to determine Smoakâ€™s boundary.Â  \r\n  Smoak appeals.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nSmoak and McCullough are adjoining landowners.Â  \r\n  Smoak owns two tracts of land.Â  The first parcel, a one-hundred-acre tract, \r\n  lies to the west of the second tract, sharing a common boundary line.Â  The second \r\n  consists of approximately 2Â½ acres and lies to the east of the first tract and \r\n  to the west of McCulloughâ€™s property, sharing a common east/west boundary line \r\n  with McCulloughâ€™s property.Â  All three parcels can be traced to a common grantor, \r\n  Chester Hall, and Smoakâ€™s parcels pre-date the first conveyance of McCulloughâ€™s \r\n  tract to his predecessors in title. \r\n  [1] Â  \r\nSmoakâ€™s 2Â½-acre parcel has the following description:\r\n\r\nAll that piece, parcel or lot of land, situate [sic], in \r\n  the County of Aiken, State of South Carolina, containing two and one-half (2 \r\n  Â½) acres, more or less, and adjoining lands, now or formerly, of Elizabeth Thornton, \r\n  on the West run of branch being the line, same commencing at run at pond dam \r\n  and extending forty (40) feet East from the swamp or edge of swamp bushes to \r\n  or within twenty (20.0) feet of spring and extending West to run of said branch \r\n  probably known as Starching Branch.\r\n\r\nMcCulloughâ€™s tract was established by the following \r\n  description:\r\n\r\nAll that certain piece, parcel or tract of land situated, \r\n  lying and being in [the] State of South Carolina, County of Aiken, containing \r\n  about two acres, more or less and bounded as follows to wit:Â  Bounded all the \r\n  way on the west by the Betty Thornton estate; bounded on the north, east and \r\n  partly on the south by a County Public Road.Â  This eastern and southern boundary \r\n  follows the said road going west until a point is reached about even with a \r\n  spring, then the said southern boundary cuts across and touches the spring on \r\n  the northern side then follows the run of the spring until the western boundary \r\n  of the Betty Thornton land is reached.Â  This makes the southern boundary of \r\n  the land herein conveyed, a public County road, a spring and the run or branch \r\n  which drains the spring.Â  The spring and spring branch are not conveyed by this \r\n  deed, but the right is hereby given and sold to Colie Hall, his heirs and assigns, \r\n  to have access and entry to the said spring and to use water from the same.\r\n\r\nAfter a dispute arose about the proper boundary \r\n  between their properties, Smoak sued McCullough.Â  In her first cause of action, \r\n  Smoak alleged a dispute existed between the parties as to the location of the \r\n  east/west boundary separating their property, and there is confusion and uncertainty \r\n  as to the boundary line.Â  Smoak asked the court to settle the boundary dispute \r\n  and to quiet the title to her property. \r\nIn her second cause of action, Smoak alleged she \r\n  is in actual possession of the disputed property, and McCullough trespassed \r\n  to access the pond.Â  In her third cause of action for trespass quare clausum \r\n  fregit, Smoak sought damages for an invasion of her possession of the property \r\n  by McCullough, alleging he cut and removed trees.Â  \r\nMcCullough admitted the chains of title and descriptions \r\n  but generally denied the material allegations of the complaint.Â Â Â  \r\nAt trial, Smoak presented the testimony of an expert \r\n  land surveyor.Â  In reviewing the deeds in question, Smoakâ€™s expert testified \r\n  he was unable to locate the eastern boundary of Smoakâ€™s tract because the swamp \r\n  bushes were no longer in existence.Â  \r\nMcCullough presented the testimony of his own expert \r\n  surveyor.Â  McCulloughâ€™s expert testified that he too was unable to locate the \r\n  eastern boundary of the 2Â½-acre track based on Smoakâ€™s and McCulloughâ€™s deeds \r\n  because the natural boundaries mentioned in both deeds no longer existed. \r\nMcCullough also presented the testimony of M.C. Smith, \r\n  a former owner of his tract of land, who testified the purpose of conveying \r\n  the 2Â½-acre tract was to allow Smoakâ€™s predecessor in title to fill in the pond \r\n  and own to the edge of it. [2] Â  \r\nThe master ruled the evidence was insufficient to establish \r\n  a boundary between the two tracts.Â  Furthermore, the master ruled Smoak failed \r\n  to prove a trespass by McCullough, and for that reason, the court could not \r\n  provide any relief.Â  Therefore, the master dismissed the case in full. Smoak \r\n  appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œ[T]he character, as legal or equitable, of an \r\n  action is determined by the complaint in its main purpose, the nature of the \r\n  issues as raised by the pleadings or the pleadings and proof, and the character \r\n  of the relief sought under them.â€ Clark v. Hargrave, 323 S.C. 84, 86, \r\n  473 S.E.2d 474, 476 (Ct. App. 1996); Ins. Fin. Servs., Inc. v. South Carolina \r\n  Ins. Co., 271 S.C. 289, 293, 247 S.E.2d 315, 318 (1978).Â  Furthermore, where \r\n  the plaintiffâ€™s complaint alleges some feature of equitable cognizance, such \r\n  as obliteration of the boundary line by the adjoining landowner, a cause of \r\n  action to settle a boundary dispute is in equity. Uxbridge Co. v. Poppenheim, \r\n  135 S.C. 26, 30, 133 S.E. 461, 461 (1926).Â Â  \r\nSmoakâ€™s complaint asks the master to \r\n  establish the true boundary between the properties.Â  Smoak alleges the natural \r\n  boundaries are no longer ascertainable because McCullough obliterated the natural \r\n  markers.Â  Additionally, Smoak asks the master to enjoin future trespasses.\r\nMcCullough does not assert an issue of \r\n  title in his answer to the complaint or at trial.Â  Furthermore, the proof presented \r\n  by both parties at trial supports the conclusion the natural markers defining \r\n  the east/west border are no longer visible, and the true boundary cannot be \r\n  ascertained by direct reference to them.Â  Moreover, although McCullough denies \r\n  obliterating the natural markers, he does admit he has cut some of the foliage \r\n  and filled land using a backhoe.Â  \r\nAs we view the pleadings, the paramount question \r\n  to be decided is the placement of the boundary between the lands of the parties \r\n  based upon their existing property descriptions in an action to quiet title.Â  \r\n  Thus, we view this as an action in equity.Â  See Bryan v. Bryan, \r\n  285 S.C. 434, 437, 330 S.E.2d 310, 312 (Ct. App. 1985) (holding an action to \r\n  quiet title is one in equity).Â  This conclusion is further supported by the \r\n  fact that Smoak claims McCullough obliterated the swamp grass and bushes, which \r\n  were the only markers for the boundary between their properties. See \r\n  Uxbridge Co. v. Poppenheim, 135 S.C. at 30, 133 S.E. at 461. Â Consequently, \r\n  this Court may take its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â Â  Hayne \r\n  Fed. Credit Union v. Bailey, 327 S.C. 242, 247, 489 S.E.2d 472, 475 (1997) \r\n  (â€œOur scope of review of a case heard by a master who enters a final judgment \r\n  is to determine facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of \r\n  the evidence.â€).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSmoak argues the master erred by concluding the \r\n  boundary line between the lands owned by the parties is impossible to determine.Â  \r\n  We agree. [3] \r\nâ€œThe paramount and cardinal rule of construction \r\n  of a deed is to ascertain the intention of the grantor as expressed by him in \r\n  the deed and then to give effect to that intention if it can be done without \r\n  violating an established rule of law.â€Â  Rhodes v. Black, 170 S.C. 193, \r\n  200, 170 S.E. 158, 159 (1933).Â  \r\nIn ascertaining a boundary, it has long been established \r\n  that the court â€œresort[s], 1st, to natural boundaries, such as rocks, mountains, \r\n  rivers, and creeks; 2nd, to artificial marks, such as corner trees and stations; \r\n  3rd, to adjacent boundaries; 4th, course and distance; and 5th, the shape of \r\n  the plat.â€ Wash v. Holmes, 19 S.C.L. (1 Hill) 12, 15 (Ct. App. 1833).Â  \r\n\r\nInitially, we note, the only direct evidence of \r\n  the boundary line is the vegetation that no longer exists.Â  There are no artificial \r\n  marks noted by either side, and the adjacent boundary is not directly helpful \r\n  because it refers to Smoakâ€™s boundary as its western boundary.Â  However, we \r\n  conclude the key to the solution lies in reconciling the wording of the deed \r\n  descriptions with the evidence within the record.\r\nSmoakâ€™s deed states the northern boundary of the \r\n  2Â½-acre tract is a pond dam, and the western boundary of the tract is a creek \r\n  branch.Â  The deed further states the tract is bordered on the east by swamp \r\n  bushes, presumably on the eastern side of the watercourse.Â  The deed creating \r\n  McCulloughâ€™s tract states the western boundary to his tract of land is the eastern \r\n  boundary of Smoakâ€™s tract of land.Â  The deed further grants the right to enter \r\n  and use the spring drained by the branch but clearly excludes the spring from \r\n  the deed. [4] Â  \r\nAerial photographs establish the pond came into \r\n  existence between 1951 and 1955.Â  Furthermore, M.C. Smith, a former owner of \r\n  McCulloughâ€™s tract, testified he was familiar with all of the boundaries of \r\n  the property, even before he owned it.Â  Additionally, he testified the purpose \r\n  of Smoakâ€™s deed description was to allow Smoakâ€™s predecessor to fill the pond \r\n  and to own to the edge of it. [5] Â  \r\nWe conclude the pond dam existed at the time the \r\n  2Â½-acre tract was conveyed to Smoakâ€™s predecessor in title, but the pond had \r\n  not yet been formed.Â  \r\nWhen we view the other evidence within the record \r\n  in light of that conclusion, we hold the grantor intended to include all of \r\n  the land covered by the pond within the 2Â½-acre conveyance.Â  This explains why \r\n  the grantors referred in the same deed to the â€œrun of branchâ€ as the western \r\n  edge of the 2Â½-acre tract, a natural marker no longer ascertainable once the \r\n  pond filled.Â  See Ex Parte Keller, 189 S.C. 26, 36, 199 S.E. 909, \r\n  914 (1938) (holding all grants and conveyances are presumed to be made with \r\n  reference to an actual view of the premises by the parties).Â  Â Additionally, \r\n  it is consistent with Smithâ€™s testimony that the 2Â½-acre tract was conveyed \r\n  with an eastern boundary paralleling the swamp grass or bushes to give Smoakâ€™s \r\n  predecessor the entire pond once it was formed.Â  Finally, this is consistent \r\n  with the express language in the deed description creating McCulloughâ€™s tract \r\n  giving him use and access to the spring now lying under the pond but specifically \r\n  excluding ownership of it from his grant. [6] \r\nThus, we conclude the evidence, in conjunction \r\n  with the language in the deeds, indicates the 2Â½-acre tract was conveyed with \r\n  an eastern boundary of the swamp bushes to ensure that when the creek flooded \r\n  and became a pond, an eventuality that was contemplated but clearly had not \r\n  yet occurred, the pond would be within the 2Â½-acre tract.Â  Therefore, we hold \r\n  the intent of the grantors was to grant Smoakâ€™s predecessor in title exclusive \r\n  ownership of the pond, while granting McCullough the land up to the edge of \r\n  the pond.Â  Consequently, the boundary between the properties should properly \r\n  be marked as the edge of the pond.Â  \r\nHaving concluded the eastern edge of the pond is \r\n  the intended boundary separating the lands of the parties, with the right to \r\n  access and use the water reserved to McCullough, we agree with the masterâ€™s \r\n  conclusion that Smoak failed in her burden of proving trespass or trespass quare \r\n  clausum fregit. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the denial of relief \r\n  based upon trespass and trespass quare clausum fregit is AFFIRMED, that \r\n  portion of the order of the master, dismissing this suit is REVERSED, \r\n  and this matter is REMANDED with instructions to the master to set the \r\n  disputed boundary dividing the lands of the parties along the eastern edge of \r\n  the pond in accordance with this opinion.Â  Should disagreement remain between \r\n  the parties as to the location of any part of the eastern edge of the pond or \r\n  of the disputed boundary itself after location of the pond edge, the master \r\n  is authorized to take all measures necessary to resolve the controversy, including \r\n  the taking of additional evidence or retention of a surveyor or other expert, \r\n  as needed, with the expense thereof to be borne by the parties in such amounts \r\n  as shall be determined by the master.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and \r\nREMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HUFF, and HOWARD, JJ., concurring.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] \r\n    Smoakâ€™s chain of title begins with Chester and Jerry Hall.Â  Chester and \r\n    Jerry Hall conveyed the property by deed to Elizabeth Thornton in 1953.Â  Subsequently, \r\n    in 1964, Thorntonâ€™s heirs conveyed the property by deed to Arthur Keels.Â  \r\n    Thereafter, in 1976, Smoak received her deed from Keels.Â  \r\n  McCulloughâ€™s chain of title also begins with \r\n    Chester Hall, who granted the tract to Colie Hall almost eleven years after \r\n    the grant to Smoakâ€™s predecessor in 1964.Â  Colie Hall then conveyed the tract \r\n    to M.C. Smith in 1968.Â  M.C. Smith conveyed the tract to Janice K. Smith by \r\n    deed dated April 14, 1992, although the description of the tract changed to \r\n    refer to a plat prepared by C. Ashley Abel on March 27, 1992.Â  Janice K. Smith \r\n    conveyed the property to McCullough on August 18, 2000.Â  His deed makes reference \r\n    to a plat prepared by Arthur J. Weed on August 15, 2000.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] M.C. Smith is the nephew of Coley Hall.Â  Coley Hall was the son of \r\n    the common grantor, Jerry Hall.Â  Smithâ€™s wife was Elizabeth Thorntonâ€™s granddaughter.Â  \r\n    Elizabeth Thornton was the initial grantee in Smoakâ€™s chain and was the sister \r\n    of Jerry Hall.Â  Smith testified that he was familiar with all of the boundaries \r\n    of the property, even before he owned it.Â  According to Smith, he was raised \r\n    less than 300 yards from the property and owned it for twenty-three or twenty-four \r\n    years.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] \r\n    Although we agree the master erred by dismissing the suit for lack of \r\n    evidence, we do not agree with Smoakâ€™s proposed boundary.Â  Smoak contends \r\n    this Court should connect the northeastern and southeastern boundaries of \r\n    her property as determined by her expert surveyor, drawing a straight line \r\n    between them as the east/west boundary between the properties.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] \r\n    Generally, when a swamp or a stream is given in a deed as the boundary \r\n    of property, the parties will be presumed to have intended the middle of the \r\n    swamp or stream as the boundary.Â  Wheeler v. Wheeler, 111 S.C. 87, \r\n    94, 96 S.E. 714, 715 (1918).Â  However, where, as here, the deed specifically \r\n    excludes the watercourse, the presumption is rebutted.Â Â  See Wheeler, \r\n    111 S.C. at 94-95, 96 S.E. at 716 (â€œIt may be shown that the parties intended \r\n    the edge of the swamp rather than the stream as the boundary . . . . [I]t \r\n    may be done by other competent evidence appearing either upon the face of \r\n    the deed itself, or of the plat made at the time, and proof of the actual \r\n    location of a different boundary line on the ground, and possession taken \r\n    and held to the boundary so located.â€).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5] \r\n    See Richardson v. Register, 227 S.C. 81, 90, 87 S.E.2d 40, \r\n    44 (1955) (holding evidence of common repute is admissible as to the location \r\n    of a private as well as a public boundary line); see also Holden \r\n    v. Cantrell, 100 S.C. 265, 279, 84 S.E. 826, 829 (1915) (holding a boundary \r\n    may be established by reference to declarations of former owners of plaintiffâ€™s \r\n    land, made while they were in possession thereof, accompanying and explaining \r\n    acts of ownership and tending to show the character and extent of their possession).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6] The confusion in this case is due partly to the fact that the deed \r\n    creating McCulloughâ€™s tract, conveyed to his predecessor in title eleven years \r\n    after the 2Â½-acre tract was conveyed, does not mention the pond and refers \r\n    only to Smoakâ€™s predecessorâ€™s eastern boundary as its western boundary.Â  The \r\n    problem is exacerbated by the reference to a spring that drains a branch now \r\n    forming a part of the pond.Â  The aerial photographs taken in 1955 show the \r\n    pond was in existence, and the line of the branch was no longer ascertainable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-099","title":"SC Department of Social Services v.

Jones and R. Clenten Campbell, of Walterboro, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Appellant sued Dorchester County \r\n  and the master in equity after the master vacated Appellantâ€™s purchase of a \r\n  property at an auction conducted by the master. The trial judge granted summary \r\n  judgment to both defendants. We affirm.\r\n FACTS\r\nDorchester County sold a property at an auction \r\n  on March 1, 1999. That auction was a mistake because Money First Financial Services, \r\n  one of the interested parties, had not been properly noticed about the auction. [1]  Michael Westbury attended the auction and placed \r\n  the highest bid. Following the sale, the master in equity realized that the \r\n  auction had been an error, not only because Money First did not attend, but \r\n  also because a new Notice of Sale had not been issued. The master vacated the \r\n  sale and refunded Westbury his earnest money. When the property was properly \r\n  auctioned in July 1999, Westbury was present but did not place the highest bid; \r\n  therefore he did not obtain the property. \r\nIn February 2001, Westbury brought a â€œviolation \r\n  of legal sale actionâ€ against Dorchester County and Patrick Watts, the master \r\n  who conducted the sale. Following a hearing where Westbury acted as his own \r\n  counsel, the trial court issued an order granting summary judgment to the county \r\n  and to the master. Westbury appeals.\r\nISSUES \r\n  [2]&nbsp;  \r\n\r\n1) Did the trial court err in finding that the master \r\n  was entitled to judicial immunity? \r\n(2) Did the trial court err in granting summary \r\n  judgment to the master?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS \r\n  [3]&nbsp;  \r\nSummary judgment is appropriate where there is \r\n  no genuine issue of material fact and it is clear the moving party is entitled \r\n  to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP. â€œIn determining whether \r\n  any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences \r\n  therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€Â  \r\n  Osborne ex rel. Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 \r\n  (2001). An appellate court reviews the grant of summary judgment under the same \r\n  standard applied by the trial court.Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, \r\n  451, 548 S.E.2d 868, 873 (2001).\r\nThe trial court ruled that the master was acting \r\n  within his official capacity and was therefore entitled to judicial immunity. \r\n  We agree. Judicial immunity is a longstanding legal principle. See McEachern \r\n  v. Black, 329 S.C. 642, 647, 496 S.E.2d 659, 661 (Ct. App. 1998) (â€œJudicial \r\n  immunity is one of the fundamental pillars upon which the modern system of justice \r\n  was built.â€). That principle is statutory and is also recognized at common law. \r\n  Williams v. Condon, 347 S.C. 227, 246, 553 S.E.2d 496, 506 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001). â€œJudicial immunity affords absolute immunity from suit. Therefore, a \r\n  finding of judicial immunity renders a complaint alleging judicial misconduct \r\n  meritless.â€ McEachern, 329 S.C. at 647, 496 S.E.2d at 661 (citation omitted).Â  \r\n  However, judicial immunity will not protect judicial officers if they act without \r\n  any jurisdiction, or if their act is not a judicial one, or if the suit is seeking \r\n  exclusively prospective, injunctive relief. Id. at 648, 496 S.E.2d at \r\n  662. \r\nHere, the master was acting within his official \r\n  capacity when he mistakenly allowed the auction to proceed on the wrong date \r\n  and without proper notice. And he was acting within his official capacity when \r\n  he vacated the sale. Therefore, his actions were well within the limits of his \r\n  jurisdiction. Westbury seems to argue that the master should be liable because \r\n  the master made a mistake. But a master would be â€œabsolutely immune from liability \r\n  for his judicial acts even if his exercise of authority [was] flawed by the \r\n  commission of grave procedural errors.â€ Id. at 649, 496 S.E.2d at 663. \r\n  The trial court was correct in granting summary judgment to the master.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  The original date was March 1, but the master \r\n    had changed it to April 5.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Westbury raises the following issues: â€œ(1) Did \r\n    the trial judge err in finding [the master was] employed by Dorchester County? \r\n    (2) Did the trial judge err in finding that [the master was] paid by Dorchester \r\n    County tax dollars of $52,593? (3) Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.â€ Since Westbury \r\n    seeks a reversal of the summary judgment as â€œto the charge of appellant as \r\n    listed in [the] complaint,â€ we adopt Dorchesterâ€™s articulation of the issues.Â Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  The trial court granted summary judgment to both \r\n    the master and the county. In his brief, Westbury mentions that â€œDorchester \r\n    County has an employee named Judge Patrick Watts,â€ (the master). But that \r\n    declaration is a mere statement of fact, not an argument. Since Westbury presented \r\n    no substantive argument against the judgeâ€™s ruling concerning Dorchester County, \r\n    he is considered to have waived that issue on appeal. See Gold Kist, \r\n    Inc. v. Citizens and S. Natâ€™l Bank of South Carolina, 286 S.C. 272, 275, \r\n    333 S.E.2d 67, 70 (Ct. App. 1985) (ruling that issues not argued in the appellantâ€™s \r\n    brief are deemed abandoned on appeal). Therefore, we limit our analysis to \r\n    the summary judgment concerning the master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-101","title":"Hutto v.

Smoak, Jr., Master-in-Equity\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-101\r\nSubmitted December 23, 2003 â€“ Filed February 18, 2004 \r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJames Chaplin Cox, III, of Columbia, for Appellant,\r\nF. Matlock Elliott andÂ  Phillip Florence, Jr., both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Beverly Hutto appeals a grant \r\n  of summary judgment to the County of Aiken based on her failure to serve the \r\n  summons and complaint in her civil action against the County within the prescribed \r\n  statute of limitations.Â  Hutto contends that, as a matter of law, service was \r\n  sufficiently completed before the statute of limitations expired.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn May 2000, a family court judge in Aiken County \r\n  issued a bench warrant for Hutto, alleging she failed to pay child support â€œas \r\n  ordered.â€Â  Consequently, Hutto was arrested and incarcerated in June 2000. \r\n  [1] Â  \r\nHutto initiated the present action, claiming she \r\n  was improperly arrested because the bench warrant was issued based on false \r\n  information given to the family court by an employee of the Aiken County Clerk \r\n  of Court. [2] Â  According to a signed â€œcertified mail receiptâ€, \r\n  she mailed a copy of the summons and complaint to â€œJoan Williams Interim Adm. \r\n  828 Richland Ave., W. Aiken, SC 29801â€ in December 2001.Â  A person named Sherry \r\n  Mathis apparently signed the receipt on December 12, 2001, indicating receipt \r\n  of the summons and complaint.\r\nThe County did not answer the summons and complaint, \r\n  prompting Hutto to seek an order granting entry of default against the county.Â  \r\n  The County subsequently moved to set aside the entry of default.Â  In August \r\n  2, 2002 order, the master-in-equity set aside the entry of default, finding \r\n  â€œthe Complaint was never properly served on the Defendant [County] in this matter.â€Â  \r\n  Additionally, he specified that attorney James M. Davis was the Countyâ€™s proper \r\n  agent for service of process, and directed Hutto to effect service on him.Â  \r\n  Hutto then served the summons and complaint on Davis on August 8, 2002.Â  \r\nAfter receiving service of Huttoâ€™s summons and \r\n  complaint, the County filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing the action \r\n  was barred by the applicable two-year statute of limitations provided by the \r\n  S.C. Tort Claims Act.Â  Following a hearing, the master-in-equity granted the \r\n  Countyâ€™s summary judgment motion based upon his finding that Huttoâ€™s action \r\n  was barred by the two-year statute of limitations provided by the S.C. Tort \r\n  Claimâ€™s Act, since Huttoâ€™s cause of action arose in June 2000 but she didnâ€™t \r\n  complete service until August 2002.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œSummary judgment is appropriate \r\n  when it is clear that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the \r\n  moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  CafÃ© Assocs., \r\n  Ltd. v. Gerngross, 305 S.C. 6, 9, 406 S.E.2d 162, 164 (1991).Â  â€œIn ruling \r\n  on a motion for summary judgment, the evidence and the inferences which can \r\n  be drawn therefrom should be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving \r\n  party.â€Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHutto argues that the trial court erred in granting \r\n  summary judgment to the County on the ground that her action was bared by the \r\n  applicable statute of limitations.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs an initial matter, we note that Hutto does not \r\n  dispute that the action is subject to a two-year statute of limitations provided \r\n  by the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. 15-78-110 \r\n  (Supp. 2001); Harrison v. Bevilacqua, 354 S.C. 129, 134, 580 S.E.2d 109, \r\n  112 (2003) (â€œ[A]ny action brought pursuant to this chapter is forever barred \r\n  unless an action is commenced within two years after the date the loss was or \r\n  should have been discovered.â€)Â  Instead, she contends that service was effectuated \r\n  when she mailed the summons and complaint to â€œJoan Williamsâ€ in December 2001.Â  \r\n  Specifically, she contends she substantially complied with the rule of civil \r\n  procedure regarding service of process by mailing the documents to the Aiken \r\n  County Administrator, â€œthe proper agent for service of process against the County \r\n  of Aiken.â€ \r\nRule 4(d), SCRCP, provides service of process may \r\n  be made:\r\n\r\n(1) Â Â Â  Upon an individual other than a minor under the age \r\n  of 14 years or an incompetent person, by delivering a copy of the summons and \r\n  complaint to him personally or by leaving copies thereof at his dwelling house \r\n  or usual place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then \r\n  residing therein, or by delivering a copy to an agent authorized by appointment \r\n  or by law to receive service of process.  \r\nâ€¦\r\n(3) Â Â Â  Upon a corporation or upon a partnership or other \r\n  unincorporated association which is subject to suit under a common name, by \r\n  delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to an officer, a managing \r\n  or general agent, or to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law \r\n  to receive service of process and if the agent is one authorized by statute \r\n  to receive service and the statute so requires, by also mailing a copy to the \r\n  defendant. \r\n\r\n\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  This rule serves the dual purposes of conferring personal \r\n  jurisdiction on the court and assuring the defendant of reasonable notice of \r\n  the action.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe plaintiff bears the burden of establishing \r\n  that the court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant.Â  Moore v. Simpson, \r\n  322 S.C. 518, 523, 473 S.E.2d 64, 66 (1996).Â  Exacting compliance with the rules \r\n  of civil procedure is not required to effect service of process.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  â€œRather, inquiry must be made as to whether the plaintiff has sufficiently complied \r\n  with the rules such that the court has personal jurisdiction of the defendant \r\n  and the defendant has notice of the proceedings.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nHere, Hutto attempted service, as required \r\n  by Rule 4(d), SCRCP, on a person named Joan Williams, as the purported Interim \r\n  Aiken County Administrator.Â  However, the record contains no dispute as to the \r\n  fact that Aiken County did not employ a person named Joan Williams or that it \r\n  did not have an interim county administrator at the time service was attempted.Â  \r\n  The summons and complaint were apparently received by a person named Sherry \r\n  Mathis, who signed the receipt returned from the summons and complaint.Â  There \r\n  is no allegation that any person named Sherry Mathis had specific authorization \r\n  to receive service on behalf of the County.Â  Thus, we find as a matter of law \r\n  that Hutto did not sufficiently comply with the applicable rules of civil procedure, \r\n  and consequently failed to effectuate service upon the County during her December \r\n  2001 attempt.Â  See Moore v. Simpson, 322 S.C. at 523-24, 473 S.E.2d \r\n  at 56-57 (determining that without specific authorization to receive service, \r\n  service is not effected upon an employee of a Defendant.)Â  While exacting compliance \r\n  with service of process rules is not required, the departure here is too substantial.Â  \r\n  To uphold this attempted service as valid would effectively render the requirements \r\n  of Rule 4 meaningless.\r\nWe find that the record indicates Huttoâ€™s cause \r\n  of action arose in June 2000 and a two-year statute of limitations applies.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the statutory period within which she was required to complete \r\n  service of process sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction over the County \r\n  expired in June 2002.Â  Because the record indicates that Hutto did not properly \r\n  effect service on the County until two months later, in August 2002, we find \r\n  as a matter of law that the master-in-equity properly granted summary judgment \r\n  to the County on the grounds that the action was barred by the statute of limitations.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the forgoing reasons, the decision of the Master-in-Equity \r\n  is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HOWARD, and KITTREDGE, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  The record is unclear as the specific date of her arrest or \r\n    the duration of her incarceration.Â  The parties do not dispute that she was \r\n    arrested in June 2000.Â  As to the duration of her incarceration, Huttoâ€™s brief \r\n    states she â€œremained in custody against her will until she was released by \r\n    the presiding Family Court Judge of Aiken County.â€Â  The County of Aikenâ€™s \r\n    brief specifies that she only remained in jail â€œover night.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [2]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  The summons and complaint does not appear in the record, but \r\n    the record and briefs indicate Hutto brought a negligence action against the \r\n    County for false arrest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-102","title":"State v.

Cain, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-103\r\nSubmitted February 9, 2004 â€“ Filed February \r\n  18, 2004\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nBruce W. Bannister, of Greenville, for Appellant\r\nPamela A. Forrest, of Fountain Inn, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this action, Jack \r\n  Lautner (Husband) appeals an order by the family court regarding the equitable \r\n  distribution of marital property owned by him and his wife, Pamela (Wife).Â  \r\n  He argues the family court erred in finding passive earnings on the nonmarital \r\n  portion of a retirement account to be marital property.Â  We reverse and remand. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were married in \r\n  1985 in Greenville County.Â  They separated on April 11, 2000, and this domestic \r\n  action followed.Â  At the time of the marriage, Husband worked for Hart Graphics, \r\n  Inc., which provided a 401(k) retirement account.\r\nAt the initial hearing, it was \r\n  agreed by the parties that portions of this account were earned prior to the \r\n  marriage and that other portions were marital property.Â  The parties agreed \r\n  that Wife would provide the court with appropriate records from the retirement \r\n  plan administrator as to the value of the account on the date of the marriage \r\n  and that Husbandâ€™s expert would calculate the amount of passive increases thereto.Â  \r\n  At the second hearing, however, neither party presented an official record as \r\n  to the exact amount of the account on the date of the marriage.Â  Husband informed \r\n  the court that he was unable to obtain this information from the plan administrator.\r\nNotwithstanding the lack of official \r\n  records as to the value of the account on the date of the marriage, both parties \r\n  presented evidence concerning this non-marital portion and the passive increases \r\n  thereafter accumulated.Â  Wifeâ€™s expert was not present at trial and was not \r\n  subject to any cross-examination as to his qualifications or methods. All evidence \r\n  provided by him was in the form of a one-page report.Â  Husbandâ€™s expert appeared \r\n  at trial and seemed to base his testimony on additional data not considered \r\n  by Wifeâ€™s expert. Â The judge found the report and evidence presented \r\n  by Husbandâ€™s expert to be the most reliable and allocated this reportâ€™s recommended \r\n  $16,606 as the pre-marital contribution amount. Â The judge also found \r\n  that this amount has since earned passive increases of $64,485. Â While \r\n  not waiving any claim to these passive increases, Wifeâ€™s counsel did stipulate \r\n  to the method of calculation of the value of the premarital portion of the account.\r\nIn his final order concerning the \r\n  equitable distribution of the property, the judge awarded Husband a credit for \r\n  the premarital contribution amount, but deemed all passive increases â€œmarital \r\n  propertyâ€ and divided this amount between the parties. Â Husband appeals, \r\n  arguing that the judge erred in holding that passive earnings on the nonmarital \r\n  portion of the retirement account constituted marital property.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this \r\n  court has the authority to find facts in accordance with our own view of the \r\n  preponderance of the evidence.Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 \r\n  S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â  This broad scope of review, however, does not require \r\n  us to disregard the findings of the family court judge, who saw and heard the \r\n  witnesses and was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign \r\n  comparative weight to their testimony.Â  McElveen v. McElveen, 332 S.C. \r\n  583, 591, 506 S.E.2d 1, 5 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nUnder South Carolina law, it is clear \r\n  that a passive increase in the value of a pre-marital investment, unless the \r\n  investment is transmuted into marital property, remains nonmarital property \r\n  and is not subject to equitable division by order of the family court.Â  \r\nThe family court does not have jurisdiction or authority \r\n  to apportion nonmarital property.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. \r\n  2003) (â€œThe court does not have jurisdiction or authority to apportion nonmarital \r\n  property.â€).Â  Marital property is statutorily defined as any property â€œacquired \r\n  by the parties during the marriage.â€ Id.Â  The statute also clearly states \r\n  that any â€œincrease in value in nonmarital property, except to the extent that \r\n  the increase resulted directly or indirectly from efforts of the other spouseâ€ \r\n  remains non-marital property.Â  Id. Â§ 20-7-473(5); See also \r\n  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 294, 372 S.E.2d 107, 110 (Ct. App. \r\n  1998) (finding passive earnings on a nonmarital IRA account to be nonmarital \r\n  property).\r\nIn the case before us, the family court judge found, \r\n  and the parties agreed, that a portion of Husbandâ€™s retirement fund was nonmarital \r\n  property invested prior to the marriage.Â  This amount was stipulated and properly \r\n  credited to Husband.Â  The amount of earnings, however, that this amount had \r\n  accrued through no effort by either spouse was wrongfully split between Husband \r\n  and Wife.Â  Having determined at trial that $64,485 of the retirement fund was \r\n  attributable to passive earnings on nonmarital investments, it was then error \r\n  to divide this portion of the fund between the parties. Unless transmuted or \r\n  the result of efforts by the claiming spouse, any increase in the value of nonmarital \r\n  property is itself nonmarital property. See Johnson, 296 S.C. \r\n  at 294, 372 S.E.2d at 110; Calhoun v. Calhoun, 331 S.C. 157, 174, 501 \r\n  S.E.2d 735, 744 (Ct. App. 1998), reversed in part 339 S.C. \r\n  96, 529 S.E.2d 14 (2000).Â  \r\nIn rather conclusory fashion, Wife claims for the \r\n  first time on appeal that the retirement account became marital property through \r\n  transmutation.Â  While in certain circumstances nonmarital property may be transmuted \r\n  into marital property, the spouse asserting this transmutation â€œmust produce \r\n  [at trial, not on appeal] objective evidence showing that, during the marriage, \r\n  the parties themselves regarded the property as the common property of the marriage.â€ \r\n  Johnson, 296 S.C. at 298, 372 S.E.2d at 110-11.Â  Wife cites no such evidence, \r\n  nor can we find any, in the record on appeal. [2]   \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the family \r\n  court, holding that passive earnings on the non-marital portion of the retirement \r\n  account constituted marital property, is\r\nREVERSED.Â  We REMAND for a recalculation of the equitable distribution \r\n  award. \r\nHEARN, C.J., ANDERSON and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  In her responsive brief, Wife also makes vague claims of collusion \r\n    and misrepresentations at trial. We deem these claims abandoned due their \r\n    conclusory nature and the fact they are not in any way supported by the record. \r\n    See Bowen v. Lee Process Sys. Co., 342 S.C. 232, 536 S.E.2d \r\n    86 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding that the failure to provide argument or supporting \r\n    authority for an issue renders it abandoned); Zaman v.

Morris, of Charleston, for Appellant-Respondent.\r\nRichard Lippincott, of Mt. Pleasant, for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Sharon Lippincott \r\n  (â€œWifeâ€) and Richard Lippincott (â€œHusbandâ€) each appeal the family courtâ€™s valuation \r\n  of certain assets in its equitable distribution of marital property following \r\n  their divorce.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife initiated this divorce \r\n  proceeding in 1998.Â  Following their separation, they entered into a settlement \r\n  agreement that was approved and incorporated into an order of the family court \r\n  dated July 17, 2001.Â  Under the terms of the agreement, Husband and Wife agreed \r\n  to distribute their marital estate in equal shares. \r\nA disagreement arose, however, regarding the value \r\n  of several marital assets and liabilities.Â  The disputed items included:Â  Wifeâ€™s \r\n  money purchase pension plan, furniture from the marital home, marital debt and \r\n  expenses, and Husbandâ€™s Individual Retirement Account (IRA).Â  Unable to resolve \r\n  the problem themselves, Husband and Wife sought the aid of the family court \r\n  to determine the value of these items.Â  On June 4, 2002, the court conducted \r\n  a hearing on the matter.Â  On August 2, 2002, the court issued an order determining \r\n  the value of the disputed items and dividing them equally. \r\nBy way of the present cross-appeal, Husband and \r\n  Wife both argue the family court erred in reaching its valuations.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this Court has \r\n  authority to find the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, \r\n  157 (1996).Â  This broad scope of review, however, does not require us to disregard \r\n  the findings of the court below.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, \r\n  477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  We are mindful that the trial judge, who saw \r\n  and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility \r\n  and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  McAlister v. Patterson, \r\n  278 S.C. 481, 483, 299 S.E.2d 322, 323 (1982).\r\nThe family court has broad discretion in determining \r\n  how marital property is to be distributed.Â  Murphy v. Murphy, 319 S.C. \r\n  324, 329, 461 S.E.2d 39, 41 (1995). The court below may use any reasonable means \r\n  to divide the property equitably, and its judgment will not be disturbed absent \r\n  an abuse of discretion.Â  Id. at 329, 461 S.E.2d at 41-42.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Wifeâ€™s Appeal\r\nWife claims the family \r\n  court erred in its valuation of her money purchase pension plan.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe family court found \r\n  the value of the pension was $13,113.56 and that, under the separation agreement, \r\n  the parties were entitled to equal shares of $6,556.78. While not explicitly \r\n  stated in the family courtâ€™s order, this amount appears to be the value of the \r\n  pension as reflected on a June 30, 2000 \r\n  [1]  pension statement, which lists the vested account balance as $13,113.56. \r\n\r\nWife argues the family \r\n  court should have valued the pension as of June 1998, the time the parties separated.Â  \r\n  As a general rule, Wife is correct.Â  Though the required date of valuation is \r\n  not specifically prescribed by statute, our courts have held that the valuation \r\n  date should be the date marital litigation is commenced, â€œsince that is the \r\n  time that property must now be owned to come within the meaning of the term \r\n  â€˜marital property.â€™â€Â  Smith v. Smith, 294 S.C. 194, 203, 363 S.E.2d 404, \r\n  409 (Ct. App. 1987); see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2003) (defining \r\n  â€œmarital propertyâ€ as property â€œowned as of the date of filing or commencement \r\n  of marital litigationâ€); Mallett v. Mallett, 323 S.C. 141, 151, 473 S.E.2d \r\n  804, 810 (Ct. App. 1996) (â€œMarital property is valued as of the date of the \r\n  filing of the complaint.â€); Jamar v. Jamar, 308 S.C. 265, 267, 417 S.E.2d \r\n  615, 616 (Ct. App. 1992) (â€œThe proper date to value marital property is the \r\n  time the marital litigation is filed or commenced.â€). \r\nThis rule, however, has not been \r\n  inflexibly applied.Â  In Fields v. Fields, 342 S.C. 182, 536 S.E.2d 684 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2000), this Court recognized that the family court should be given \r\n  latitude to account for appreciation or depreciation in marital assets that \r\n  occurs after separation but before the equitable division can be effectuated.Â  \r\n  In that case, securities that had been awarded to the wife increased in value \r\n  during the eleven months between separation and the time the divorce was granted \r\n  and the property was divided. Id. at 187, 536 S.E.2d at 686.Â  The family \r\n  court assessed the value of the stocks as of the time of division, finding the \r\n  later date was the closest date to the partiesâ€™ divorce for which corporate \r\n  information was available. Id.Â  This Court held that â€œthe family court \r\n  was well within its discretion in deciding to value [the stocks] on the later \r\n  date.â€ Id.\r\nAs in Fields, the only \r\n  information available regarding the value of the asset in the present case was \r\n  for the later, post-separation date well after the commencement of the action.Â  \r\n  Other than Wifeâ€™s brief testimony that the money purchase pension plan was the \r\n  equivalent of Husbandâ€™s IRA valued on June 30, 1998, at approximately $2,058.79, \r\n  the June 2000 statement is the only evidence of the pensionâ€™s value contained \r\n  in the record before us.Â  Wifeâ€™s assertions regarding the June 1998 value of \r\n  the pension is without any substantiation in the record. \r\nHaving failed to meet \r\n  a minimal level of proof, Wife left the family court with little choice in selecting \r\n  a value for the pension plan.Â  The family court, therefore, did not err in assigning \r\n  the $13,113.56 value.Â  See Dixon v. Dixon, 334 S.C. 222, 228, \r\n  512 S.E.2d 539, 542 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œIt is an unfortunate reality that, given \r\n  the volume of cases handled by our family courts, there often is a substantial \r\n  delay between the commencement of an action and its ultimate resolution.Â  Thus, \r\n  it is not unusual for the value of marital assets to change, sometimes substantially, \r\n  between the time the action was commenced and its final resolution.Â  In such \r\n  a case, the family court has the ability to consider the post-filing appreciation \r\n  or depreciation when valuing and apportioning the marital estate.â€); Woodward \r\n  v. Woodward, 294 S.C. 210, 215, 363 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. App. 1987) (stating \r\n  the family courtâ€™s valuation of property will be affirmed if it is within the \r\n  range of the evidence); Smith, 294 S.C. at 198, 363 S.E.2d at 407 (holding \r\n  the family court may accept one partyâ€™s valuations of marital property over \r\n  those of the other party).\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Husbandâ€™s \r\n  Appeal\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In his cross-appeal, \r\n  Husband asserts the family court erred by unevenly dividing the furniture from \r\n  the marital home, incorrectly calculating the marital debt, and improperly including \r\n  his IRA as part of the marital property.Â  We address Husbandâ€™s arguments separately \r\n  below.Â  As with Wifeâ€™s claim, however, we find Husbandâ€™s claims fail for complete \r\n  lack of proof.\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Furniture\r\nThe parties stipulated as a part \r\n  of their settlement agreement that the furniture had a value of $15,500 and \r\n  that it would be divided equally by in-kind distribution. Husband argues he \r\n  did not receive his share of the furniture, claiming that Wife changed the locks \r\n  to the marital home and prevented him from retrieving his furniture.Â  While \r\n  there is a brief mention of furniture division during the cross-examination \r\n  of Wife and direct-examination of Husband, it does not appear from the record \r\n  that this specific argument was raised to or ruled upon by the court.Â Â  As such, \r\n  it is not properly preserved for this Courtâ€™s review.Â  See Wilder \r\n  Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 77, 497 S.E.2d 731, 734 (1998) (holding an \r\n  issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised \r\n  to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review); \r\n  Hatfield v. Hatfield, 327 S.C. 360, 369, 489 S.E.2d 212, 217 (Ct. App. \r\n  1997) (stating issue must be raised to and ruled on by family court to be preserved \r\n  for review).Â Â  \r\nÂ  Regardless of whether this \r\n  issue was properly preserved, the claim fails because Husband points to no evidence \r\n  in the record indicating the value of the furniture Husband contends he was \r\n  entitled to but did not receive.Â Â Â  Indeed, in neither the record nor Husbandâ€™s \r\n  briefs submitted to this Court is there any mention of the type of furniture \r\n  he claims or the size or number of the pieces.Â  The only statement is in Husbandâ€™s \r\n  brief where he claims: â€œThe Wife took what she wanted, . . . and left the Husband \r\n  one room of furniture of the marital home that equaled Two Thousand Five Hundred \r\n  Dollars ($2500.00). . .The Husband should receive a credit for the remaining \r\n  rooms of furniture that he did not take delivery of in the amount of Five Thousand \r\n  Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($5250).â€ \r\nFor several reasons, this bare \r\n  assertion fails to satisfy Husbandâ€™s burden of showing the family court erred.Â  \r\n  First, as previously stated, this particular argument was not raised to the \r\n  family court.Â  Secondly, there is no evidence in the Record on Appeal to support \r\n  this claim.Â  Accordingly, this Court may not consider it in our review of this \r\n  issue.Â  See Rule 210(h), SCACR (providing that appellate court review \r\n  is limited to evidence contained within the Record on Appeal); see also \r\n  Skinner v. King, 272 S.C. 520, 523, 252 S.E.2d 891, 892 (1979) (stating \r\n  appellant has the burden of convincing this Court that the family court erred); \r\n  Chanko v. Chanko, 327 S.C. 636, 643, 490 S.E.2d 630, 634 (Ct. App. 1997) \r\n  (â€œA litigant who fails to offer proof on an issue may not be heard to complain \r\n  about the courtâ€™s resolution of that issue.â€).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   \r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Marital \r\n  Debt and Expenses\r\nHusband argues the family court \r\n  improperly valued and inequitably apportioned various marital debts and expenses.Â  \r\n\r\nIn making an equitable apportionment, \r\n  the family court should consider â€œ. . . any other existing debts incurred by \r\n  the parties or either of them during the course of the marriage[.]â€Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-7-472(13) (Supp. 2003).Â  â€œ [S]ection 20-7-472 creates a presumption \r\n  that a debt of either spouse incurred prior to marital litigation is a marital \r\n  debt and must be factored in the totality of equitable apportionment.â€Â  Hardy \r\n  v. Hardy, 311 S.C. 433, 436, 429 S.E.2d 811, 813 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  â€œThe \r\n  presumption is rebuttable.â€Â  Id.\r\n\r\n(1) Â Â Â Â Â  Marital DebtÂ  \r\n\r\nThe family court valued the marital \r\n  debt at $15,145.41.Â  Although the court did not specify, this figure appears \r\n  to be the aggregate balance of five credit cards. Husband argues this was error \r\n  because the credit card statements Wife submitted at the final hearing were \r\n  either out-of-date or inaccurate.Â  The record, however, contains no evidence \r\n  reflecting what Husband claims to be the â€œcorrectâ€ amount of credit card debt.Â  \r\n  As such, we cannot find the court erred in accepting Wifeâ€™s valuation of the \r\n  marital debt.Â  See Hardy, 311 S.C. at 437, 429 S.E.2d at 813-14Â  \r\n  (holding the estate to be equitably divided by the family court is the net estate, \r\n  i.e., provision for the payment of marital debts must be apportioned \r\n  as well as the property itself; â€œbasically the same rules of fairness and equity \r\n  which apply to the equitable division of marital property also apply to the \r\n  division of marital debtsâ€); Honea v. Honea, 292 S.C. 456, 458, 357 S.E.2d \r\n  191, 192 (Ct. App. 1987) (stating the burden is on appellant to show the family \r\n  court committed reversible error and a party cannot sit back at trial without \r\n  offering proof, then come to the appellate court complaining of the insufficiency \r\n  of evidence to support the family courtâ€™s findings); see also Cherry \r\n  v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981) (holding an \r\n  appellate court is not required to ignore the fact that the trial judge, who \r\n  saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility \r\n  and assign comparative weight to their testimony).\r\nHusband next argues he should \r\n  be credited for loans obtained by Wife that were collateralized by the marital \r\n  401(K) retirement savings account.Â  Husband claims the debt incurred through \r\n  these loans should not be imputed to the marital estate because Wife forged \r\n  his signature in order to obtain them.Â  While there is a mention of loans obtained \r\n  by Wife in her testimony and Husbandâ€™s testimony in the record, no such loan \r\n  is accounted for in the family courtâ€™s order.Â  Husband did not raise this issue \r\n  in a motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  Thus, this issue is not properly \r\n  before this Court.Â  See Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 \r\n  S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (holding an issue not preserved where the trial court \r\n  does not explicitly rule on an argument and the appellant fails to make a Rule \r\n  59(e), SCRCP motion to alter or amend the judgment on that ground).Â Â  Furthermore, \r\n  the record does not contain any documentary evidence concerning any loans.Â  \r\n\r\n(2)Â Â Â Â Â Â  Marital Expenses\r\n\r\nHusband also contends the family \r\n  court erred by including Wifeâ€™s claim of $2,800 for expenses incurred in the \r\n  sale of the marital home, arguing these expenses were unsubstantiated and unjustified. [2] Â  \r\nPursuant to the settlement order \r\n  entered on July 21, 2001, the parties were directed to equally divide the proceeds \r\n  from the sale of the marital home.Â  Prior to the sale of the home, Wife paid \r\n  for home repairs, painting, yard work, and cleaning.Â  The $2,800 figure appears \r\n  to be the amount charged for minor home repairs itemized on a bill from a handyman \r\n  service that is included in the record before us. Â Â \r\nBeyond Husbandâ€™s assertion in \r\n  his brief that the $2,800 repair expense â€œwas completely unjustified, unneeded \r\n  and uncorroborated by a[] Real Estate Agentâ€ and was undertaken â€œwithout Husband[â€™]s \r\n  knowledge or approval,â€ Husband offered no evidence that the division of that \r\n  expense equally between the parties was improper or without foundation.Â  Based \r\n  on our review of the record, we find no error in the family courtâ€™s inclusion \r\n  of the home repair bill given the expenses were incurred in preparation for \r\n  the sale of the marital home.Â Â  See Hardy, 311 S.C. at 436-37, \r\n  429 S.E.2d at 813 (â€œâ€˜[M]arital debtâ€™ is debt incurred for the joint benefit \r\n  of the parties regardless of whether the parties are legally jointly liable \r\n  for the debt or whether one party is legally individually liable.â€); Jenkins \r\n  v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 103, 545 S.E.2d 531, 539 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œDebts \r\n  incurred for marital purposes are subject to equitable distribution.â€); McElveen \r\n  v. McElveen, 332 S.C. 583, 605, 506 S.E.2d 1, 12 (Ct. App. 1998) (stating \r\n  appellant bears burden of convincing the appellate court that the family court \r\n  erred).Â  Moreover, to the extent Husband challenges the amount of the home repair \r\n  bill, we find the evidence in the record supports the family courtâ€™s decision. \r\n  See Roe v. Roe, 311 S.C. 471, 478, 429 S.E.2d 830, 835 (Ct. App. \r\n  1993) (finding family court did not abuse its discretion where valuation of \r\n  marital property was supported by the evidence); see also Toler v. \r\n  Toler, 292 S.C. 374, 379, 356 S.E.2d 429, 432 (Ct. App. 1987) (â€œIn the absence \r\n  of contrary evidence, the court should have accepted the value the parties assigned \r\n  toâ€ a marital asset.).Â Â Â  \r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Inclusion \r\n  of IRA as Marital Property\r\nThe family court included Husbandâ€™s \r\n  IRA as a part of the marital estate and accordingly apportioned its value in \r\n  equal shares to the parties.Â Â  Husband asserts the IRA should not be included \r\n  as marital property because he purchased the IRA in 1983, approximately four \r\n  years prior to the marriage and never made any deposits or withdrawals from \r\n  the account during the marriage.Â  \r\nThere is no evidence, however, \r\n  this argument was raised to the court below or that the courtâ€™s inclusion of \r\n  the IRA as marital property was in any way challenged prior to this appeal.Â  \r\n  This issue is, therefore, not properly before this Court. See Creech \r\n  v.

Savitz, III, of Columbia, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, \r\n  Assistant Attorney General Melody J. Brown, all of Columbia; and SolicitorÂ  \r\n  Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â   Jeremy Jerome Knight \r\n  was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.Â  Knight appeals, \r\n  arguing the circuit court erred by refusing to charge the jury on the law of \r\n  voluntary manslaughter.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nKnight and Miranda Aull were friends.Â  Together, they \r\n  attended a small party at the apartment of Bryant Cheeks and Jeremy Petty. During \r\n  the evening, they went to Pacolet, S.C., to attend another party and then returned \r\n  in the early morning hours to continue the party at the first residence.Â  Everyone \r\n  was drinking alcohol, and some were using drugs.Â  Knight consumed both alcohol \r\n  and drugs. \r\nAull spent the rest of the night in Bryant Cheeksâ€™ \r\n  bedroom, where the two had sexual relations.Â  Knight slept on the living room \r\n  couch, but according to Cheeks, he frequently knocked on the bedroom door, pestering \r\n  Cheeks and Aull.Â  The next morning Cheeks arose, dressed, and left for work.Â  \r\n  Aull told him she was going to her grandmotherâ€™s house to change and shower \r\n  but would return later in the afternoon when Cheeks got off work at 3:00 p.m.Â  \r\n  Cheeks attempted to arouse Knight to send him home, but Knight said he was too \r\n  drunk to go home and asked to remain on the couch until later in the day.Â  Petty \r\n  was asleep in his bedroom with his door closed. \r\nPettyâ€™s mother subsequently arrived to awaken Petty.Â  \r\n  As she walked by the slightly opened door to Cheeksâ€™ bedroom, she saw Knight \r\n  laying spread-eagled on the bed.Â  She awoke Petty, and as she was leaving the \r\n  home, Knight came out of the bedroom with scratches on his face.Â  The wounds \r\n  were white, with fresh blood coming from them. \r\nWhen Cheeks returned from work in the afternoon, he \r\n  found Aull lying dead on the bed.Â  She was stiff and cold.Â  Lying on the bed \r\n  around her were pieces of a necklace, including a sharkâ€™s tooth witnesses testified \r\n  was always worn by Knight.Â  DNA samples taken from Aullâ€™s fingernail scrapings \r\n  matched the DNA of Knight with a probability of 6.3 trillion to one.Â  \r\nWhen Knight was arrested, he gave two, conflicting \r\n  statements.Â  The first read as follows:\r\n\r\nAround dusk on Sunday night (2/24 of â€™02) I drove my blue \r\n  Toyota Cressida to Jerome Pettyâ€™s duplex.Â  When I got there, Jerome was there, \r\n  and his roommate, Bryant Cheeks.Â  Also there was Miranda Aull and several other \r\n  people.Â  Everybody was drinking.Â  Later on Miranda went into one of the bedrooms \r\n  and changed clothes.Â  She came out half naked and walked around.Â  Later on someone \r\n  said something about going to a liquor house in Pacolet.Â  Me and Jerome rode \r\n  in my, my car, and Bryant, Miranda and the rest of the folks rode with Bryant.Â  \r\n  We stayed at the liquor house until a fight broke out.Â  Miranda rode back with \r\n  me and Jerome.Â  When I got back to the duplex it was me, Jerome, Bryant and \r\n  Miranda.Â  I started watching a video in the living room.Â  Miranda went Jerome \r\n  - - went with Jerome to his bedroom.Â  Less than an hour later Miranda came out \r\n  of Jeromeâ€™s bedroom.Â  She was naked.Â  She knocked on Bryantâ€™s door and told \r\n  him to unlock the door.Â  He let her in.Â  I knew that they were having sex - \r\n  - that they were having sex with her.Â  At some point I remember knocking on \r\n  Bryantâ€™s door.Â  Finally he came.Â  I told him to tell her to come up there because \r\n  I wanted to talk to her.Â  She never came out.Â  I passed out.Â  The next thing \r\n  I know I am waking up.Â  Iâ€™m face down on the floor at the foot of Bryantâ€™s bed.Â  \r\n  I remember hearing Bryant, but never saw him.Â  This is when I got up on the \r\n  bed with Miranda.Â  Miranda was in and out of sleep.Â  I donâ€™t remember exactly \r\n  what I said, but I was trying to tell her that her actions did not look good \r\n  that preceded her.Â  I tried to set her up behind.Â  She became upset and started \r\n  cursing me.Â  She said basically that it was her life and she could do whatever \r\n  she wanted to.Â  She came at me with her hand and scratched me in the eye.Â  I \r\n  got physical in a defensive way.Â  I was trying to get neutral control.Â  I used \r\n  one of my forearms to hold her down on the bed and across her neck.Â  She was \r\n  still fussing and cussing.Â  She got up again, and I think thatâ€™s when she scratched \r\n  me on the neck.Â  I held her down for a couple of moments.Â  I got off of her \r\n  and told her that I was leaving.Â  I saw that she had a tear running down her \r\n  cheek.Â  I didnâ€™t hear her crying.Â  I remember seeing Jeromeâ€™s mother.Â  I was \r\n  not laying on - - I was not laying on Miranda when I saw her.Â  I walked outside \r\n  and in my car.Â  I left and went to Walkerâ€™s house, but he wasnâ€™t up.Â  So I left \r\n  and went back to Jerome.Â  Jerome was there, and I talked to him for a couple \r\n  of minutes.Â  I left and went back to Walkerâ€™s house.Â  I spoke with him about \r\n  my car and then went home.Â  Later that afternoon I got a phone call from Mr. \r\n  Wingo.Â  He said M. F. why did you kill my niece, or did you kill my niece.Â  \r\n  I asked what are you talking about.Â  He asked me if I was over there last night, \r\n  and I told him I was there all night.Â  This statement written by Investigator \r\n  Yown as I, Jeremy Jerome Knight, directed him what to write.Â  End of Statement. \r\n\r\n\r\nSubsequently, Knight gave the following statement:\r\n\r\nOn 2/25/02 everything that I told the detectives up until \r\n  the time of the incident is true.Â  As far as the incident goes, I tried to conversate \r\n  with Miranda Aull about things I felt she was doing that she didnâ€™t need to \r\n  do. She didnâ€™t want to hear it.Â  When I tried to talk to her, she kept turning \r\n  her back.Â  As a friend, I tried to get her to listen.Â  She basically told me \r\n  to stay out of it, that from past conversations about similar matters I felt \r\n  like I couldnâ€™t let it go, because I didnâ€™t want to see her get treated the \r\n  way she has been treated in the past.Â  When she wouldnâ€™t listen and turned her \r\n  back, I tried to turn her around so she couldnâ€™t turn her back again so she \r\n  could hear what I had to say.Â  I held her shoulders down.Â  She got physical \r\n  back.Â  Thatâ€™s when the matter got out of hand.Â  At that point I began to choke \r\n  her with one hand.Â  When she scratched me, she began squeezing my face.Â  I began \r\n  to use both hands to choke her.Â  I wanted her to hear what I had to say.Â  I \r\n  felt disappointment, let down.Â  I had put so much into the friendship.Â  I let \r\n  her go before she stopped breathing.Â  She took a deep breath.Â  She was gasping \r\n  for air.Â  At that point I was scared.Â  I realized she was not breathing.Â  I \r\n  then began to pray and use C.P.R.Â  I didnâ€™t know if I was doing it right.Â  I \r\n  tried.Â  I covered her all the way up except her head.Â  I was very scared.Â  I \r\n  didnâ€™t know what to do.Â  I kept asking myself over and over again,Â  please, \r\n  God donâ€™t let this be.Â  I left the house.Â  It wasnâ€™t long at all after she died.Â  \r\n  I drove to Cowpens to see my friend Walker.Â  He wasnâ€™t there.Â  I still felt \r\n  I need to do something.Â  I didnâ€™t know what I was so - - I didnâ€™t know what \r\n  I was so scared.Â  When I went back to Jeromeâ€™s house where Mirandaâ€™s body was, \r\n  I wanted to do something.Â  I wanted to call the police, but I was too scared.Â  \r\n  I talked to Jerome there.Â  I asked him for some water for the car.Â  He let me \r\n  fill it up, and then I left.Â  Before I left, I did stick my head in the door \r\n  to see if she was still dead.Â  She was still lying in the same position.Â  I \r\n  left and went back to Cowpens to Walkerâ€™s house.Â  He wasnâ€™t home.Â  I sat with \r\n  him and his wife.Â  I wanted to tell them and ask them what to do.Â  I was too \r\n  scared.Â  I left there.Â  I went home.Â  I got home and laid down to bring myself \r\n  together so I could do something.Â  I needed to do something.Â  Mirandaâ€™s uncle \r\n  called and asked me if I, why did I do this to my niece, why did you kill my \r\n  niece.Â  I told him what are you talking about.Â  I got even more scared.Â  I knew \r\n  I had to do something.Â  I had to tell somebody.Â  I went to my girlfriendâ€™s house.Â  \r\n  Her name is Tawnya Hamilton in Chesnee.Â  I was going to tell her everything.Â  \r\n  I was also trying to call the detective who left his number for me to call with \r\n  my mother.Â  He didnâ€™t answer the phone.Â  I didnâ€™t leave a message.Â  I wanted \r\n  to talk to him.Â  I told my girlfriend some of what happened.Â  My brother came \r\n  by and I spoke to him.Â  He told me what people are saying, and then the detective \r\n  showed up.Â  I had never felt like this before.Â  I never felt anger, just disappointment.Â  \r\n  We would talk a certain way about things, and then her actions were different.Â  \r\n  This upset me she was carrying herself like that.Â  I always respected her.Â  \r\n  I always took time out for her if she needed me to show her I cared.Â  We never \r\n  argued, just small disappointments about view points.Â  I went â€“ I want her family \r\n  to know I never meant to hurt her.Â  I only wanted her to listen to me.Â  I felt \r\n  like what I had to say would have helped her to do the right things I know she \r\n  really wanted to do in life.Â  I swear all this is true.Â  I gave this statement \r\n  voluntarily.Â  I asked detective Steve Denton to write this for me as I gave \r\n  it to him.Â  \r\n\r\nBoth statements were introduced during the trial \r\n  of the case.Â  Knight did not testify.Â  At the conclusion of the evidence, the \r\n  defense requested a charge on the lesser-included offenses of voluntary and \r\n  involuntary manslaughter, [1]  \r\n  arguing the statements provided a basis for allowing the jury to consider them.Â  \r\n  The circuit court declined to charge voluntary manslaughter on the grounds that, \r\n  neither of Knightâ€™s statements provided a basis for establishing the crime resulted \r\n  from heat of passion with sufficient legal provocation, both of which are elements \r\n  of the offense.Â  Knight appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nKnight argues his statements lead to an inference \r\n  Knight killed Aull while the two were fighting, and thus, the circuit court \r\n  erred by refusing to charge the jury on the law of voluntary manslaughter.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nâ€œVoluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing \r\n  of a human being in sudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Locklair,Â  341 S.C. 352, 359-360, 535 S.E.2d 420, 424 (2000) \r\n  (quoting State v. Johnson, 333 S.C. 62, 65, 508 S.E.2d 29, 31 (1998)).Â  \r\n  Both heat of passion and sufficient legal provocation must be present at the \r\n  time of the killing to constitute voluntary manslaughter. State v. Locklair,Â  \r\n  341 S.C. at 359-360, 535 S.E.2d at 424 (quoting State v. Walker, 324 \r\n  S.C. 257, 260, 478 S.E.2d 280, 281 (1996)).Â  Sudden heat of passion upon sufficient \r\n  legal provocation that mitigates a felonious killing to manslaughter must be \r\n  such as would naturally disturb the sway of reason, and render the mind of an \r\n  ordinary person incapable of cool reflection, and produce what, according to \r\n  human experience, may be called â€œan uncontrollable impulse to do violence.â€ \r\n  State v. Locklair,Â  341 S.C. at 360, 535 S.E.2d at 424 (quoting State \r\n  v. Gardner, 219 S.C. 97, 104-105, 64 S.E.2d 130, 134 (1951)).Â  \r\nIt is proper for a trial judge to refuse to charge \r\n  voluntary manslaughter in a murder case where it very clearly appears there \r\n  is no evidence whatsoever tending to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter. \r\n  State v. Locklair,Â  341 S.C. at 360, 535 S.E.2d at 424 (citing State \r\n  v. Davis, 278 S.C. 544, 546, 298 S.E.2d 778, 779 (1983)).\r\nKnight argues his statements provide evidence of \r\n  fighting between himself and the victim, thereby establishing a factual basis \r\n  for concluding he acted in the sudden heat of passion with sufficient legal \r\n  provocation.\r\nConsidering either version of events as stated \r\n  by Knight, no facts exist indicating Knight and Aull were fighting.Â  Rather, \r\n  the evidence indicates Knight attempted to physically and verbally restrain \r\n  Aull, while she attempted to defend herself.Â  This evidence, without more, is \r\n  insufficient to establish facts or inferences demonstrating a legal provocation \r\n  for reducing the crime from murder to voluntary manslaughter.Â  Thus, the circuit \r\n  court did not err by denying Knightâ€™s motion to charge the jury on the law of \r\n  voluntary manslaughter.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Knightâ€™s conviction \r\n  is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HOWARD, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concurring.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Knight does not appeal the denial of his request \r\n    to charge involuntary manslaughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-106","title":"State v.

Dana Sinkler, of Charleston, and W. Reilly Marchant, \r\n  of Richmond, for Appellants-Respondents.\r\nHelen Tyler McFadden and W.E. Jenkinson, III, both of Kingstree, \r\n  for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This cross-appeal involves \r\n  a contract dispute and a claim for unpaid wages arising out of Alvin Shumanâ€™s \r\n  (â€œShumanâ€) employment with a car dealership.Â  A jury returned a verdict in favor \r\n  of Shuman against Charleston Lincoln Mercury (â€œCLMâ€) and Heyward B. Hyman, Sr. \r\n  [1]  for $175,000 for breach of contract and $65,000 for unpaid wages.Â  \r\n  The trial court reduced the breach of contract verdict by $65,000, doubled the \r\n  amount of unpaid wages pursuant to the South Carolina Payment of Wages Act, \r\n  and awarded Shuman $75,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  CLM and Shuman appeal.Â  We affirm \r\n  in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nShuman was employed as general manager of CLM.Â  \r\n  In addition to a set salary, Shuman received incentives or bonuses based on \r\n  the dealershipâ€™s net profit.Â  In 1998, CLM began attempts to sell the dealership.Â  \r\n  On July 30, 1998, Shuman received an â€œemployment agreementâ€ from CLM which provided \r\n  that, in exchange for Shuman using his best efforts to aid in the sale of the \r\n  dealership and continuing to serve as general manager, he would receive a $240,000 \r\n  lump sum severance payment at the time of the closing of the sale of the dealership.Â  \r\n  The agreement stated the purpose of the payment was to secure Shumanâ€™s cooperation \r\n  in selling the dealership despite the fact that the sale could result in his \r\n  loss of employment.Â  The agreement was signed by John Conway, CLMâ€™s vice-president.Â  \r\n\r\nIn January 1999, CLM began negotiations with Sonic \r\n  Automotive, Inc. for the sale of the CLM dealership.Â  Because of the pending \r\n  sale of CLM, Shuman sought employment with a car dealership in Pennsylvania.Â  \r\n  On January 9, 1999, Shuman entered into a second â€œemployment agreementâ€ with \r\n  CLM providing Shuman with a six-month term of employment, renewable unless written \r\n  notice of termination was given by either party sixty days prior to the expiration \r\n  of a term.Â  The 1999 agreement referenced the terms of the prior agreements \r\n  between the parties.Â  The 1999 agreement further provided that Shuman would \r\n  make himself available on CLMâ€™s premises a minimum of seven days per month and \r\n  would be available for telephone consultations with the owner and managers of \r\n  CLM as necessary.Â  Shuman continued working at CLM as well as with the dealership \r\n  in Pennsylvania.Â  \r\nBy letter of July 2, 1999, CLM terminated Shumanâ€™s \r\n  employment.Â  On August 17, 1999 an agreement to sell the CLM dealership to Sonic \r\n  was finalized.Â  CLM did not provide Shuman with sixty days written notice of \r\n  its intent to terminate his employment and did not provide him with a severance \r\n  payment.Â  \r\nShuman filed this action against CLM alleging damages \r\n  for breach of contract and failure to pay wages.Â  In separate verdict forms, \r\n  the jury returned a verdict in favor of Shuman against CLM in the amount of \r\n  $175,000 for the breach of contract claim and $65,000 for the failure to pay \r\n  wages claim.Â  The trial court determined that the $65,000 the jury awarded for \r\n  unpaid wages was included in the breach of contract award and reduced the verdict \r\n  by $65,000.Â  The trial court doubled the award for unpaid wages pursuant to \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-80(C) (Supp. 2002) and awarded $75,000 in attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees and costs.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  CLM argues the trial court erred in submitting \r\n  Shumanâ€™s $240,000 severance pay claim to the jury because the severance pay \r\n  agreement was contingent on Shumanâ€™s inability to obtain a comparable position \r\n  with the buyer of the CLM dealership.Â  Specifically, CLM asserts that because \r\n  Shuman accepted employment elsewhere prior to the closing of the sale of the \r\n  CLM dealership he was not entitled to the severance payment.Â  We find no error.\r\nâ€œA condition precedent is any fact . . \r\n  . which, unless excused, must exist or occur before a duty of immediate performance \r\n  by the promisor can arise.â€Â  Ballenger Corp. v. City of Columbia, 286 \r\n  S.C. 1, 5, 331 S.E.2d 365, 368 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  â€œWhether a stipulation in a \r\n  contract constitutes a condition precedent is a question of construction dependent \r\n  on the intent of the parties to be gathered from the language they employ.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  In the current appeal, there was conflicting testimony from the \r\n  parties as to whether Shuman was entitled to a severance payment.Â  The employment \r\n  agreement regarding the $240,000 severance payment made no reference to the \r\n  payment being conditioned on Shumanâ€™s failure to obtain employment with the \r\n  purchaser of the dealership.Â  Accordingly, the evidence created a jury question \r\n  as to whether Shuman was entitled to severance pay and whether the pay was contingent \r\n  on his inability to obtain comparable employment with the purchaser of the CLM \r\n  dealership.Â  See Fleming v. Borden, Inc., 316 S.C. 452, 457, 450 \r\n  S.E.2d 589, 592 (1994) (â€œIn passing on motions for directed verdict, the trial \r\n  court must view the evidence and all inferences which may reasonably be drawn \r\n  therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  If more than \r\n  one reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence, the case must be submitted \r\n  to the jury.â€).\r\n2.Â  CLM asserts the trial court erred in allowing \r\n  Shuman to testify about the meaning of the term â€œnet profitâ€ because such testimony \r\n  violated the parol evidence rule.Â  We disagree.\r\nShumanâ€™s original employment agreement \r\n  with CLM in 1997 provided that he would receive a certain percentage of the \r\n  dealershipâ€™s net profits.Â  Shuman also alleged that under the terms of the payroll \r\n  agreement he was entitled to a percentage of the â€œnet profitâ€ on the sale of \r\n  the CLM dealership to Sonic Automotive, Inc.Â  At trial the court allowed Shuman \r\n  to testify as to the construction of the term â€œnet profitâ€ in relation to the \r\n  dealership.\r\nThe parol evidence rule generally prohibits \r\n  the admission of extrinsic evidence to vary or contradict the terms of a contract.Â  \r\n  Penton v. J.F. Cleckley &amp; Co., 326 S.C. 275, 486 S.E.2d 742 (1997).Â  \r\n  Parol evidence, however, may be admissible to ascertain the true meaning and \r\n  intent of the parties when the contract is ambiguous.Â  Id.; see also \r\n  Klutts Resort Realty, Inc. v. Down â€˜Round Dev. Corp., 268 S.C. 80, 232 \r\n  S.E.2d 20 (1977).Â  â€œAn ambiguous contract is one capable of being understood \r\n  in more ways than just one or one unclear in meaning because it expresses its \r\n  purpose in an indefinite manner.â€Â  Penton, 326 S.C. at 280, 486 S.E.2d \r\n  at 745.Â  â€œThe subject-matter of the contract and the purpose of its execution \r\n  are material to the ascertainment of the intention of the parties and the meaning \r\n  of the terms they use, and when these are ascertained they must prevail over \r\n  the dry words of an agreement.â€Â  Chatfield-Woods Co. v. Harley, 124 S.C. \r\n  280, 286, 117 S.E. 539, 541 (1923) (citation omitted).Â  \r\nHere, the term â€œnet profitâ€ was ambiguous \r\n  and the trial court allowed Shuman to explain the term within the context of \r\n  car dealerships.Â  We find this testimony did not violate the parol evidence \r\n  rule and did not vary or contradict the terms of the partiesâ€™ written agreements.\r\n3.Â  The jury awarded Shuman $65,000 for his unpaid \r\n  wages claim.Â  The trial court doubled the award pursuant to the South Carolina \r\n  Payment of Wages Act.Â  CLM argues the trial court abused its discretion in doubling \r\n  the award.Â  Conversely, Shuman asserts that he was entitled to treble damages.\r\nSection 41-10-80(C) of the Payment of \r\n  Wages Act provides that â€œ[i]n case of any failure to pay wages . . . the employee \r\n  may recover in a civil action an amount equal to three times the full amount \r\n  of the unpaid wages, plus costs and reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees as the court \r\n  may allow.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-80(C) (Supp. 2002).Â  \r\nOur supreme court has held that a trial \r\n  court has the discretion to decide whether or not to award treble damages:Â  \r\n  â€œIf there is a dispute over unpaid wages the employer acts at his peril and \r\n  the court in its discretion may award treble damages when the withholding was \r\n  unreasonable and there was no good faith wage dispute.â€Â  Rice v. Multimedia \r\n  Inc., 318 S.C. 95, 99, 456 S.E.2d 381, 383 (1995) (citation omitted).Â  Citing \r\n  Rice, this Court recently reiterated that the statuteâ€™s explicit statement \r\n  that the employee â€œmayâ€ recover treble damages indicates the matter is committed \r\n  to the trial courtâ€™s discretion.Â  Oâ€™Neal v. Intermedical Hosp., 355 S.C. \r\n  499, 585 S.E.2d 526 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nWe find the statute specifically provides the court \r\n  with discretion to award an amount equal to three times the amount of \r\n  the unpaid wages, rather than an amount up to three times the unpaid \r\n  wages, so the doubling of an unpaid wages award is not an option.Â  Consequently, \r\n  we reverse the trial courtâ€™s doubling of the unpaid wages award and remand for \r\n  the court to decide, in its discretion, whether or not to award treble damages \r\n  on the unpaid wages claim.Â  The court should base its determination on the current \r\n  record and explain the grounds for its ruling. \r\n4.Â  CLM argues the trial courtâ€™s award to Shuman \r\n  of $75,000 for attorneyâ€™s fees was excessive and improper.Â  We find the award \r\n  of attorneyâ€™s fees was not excessive under the circumstances of this case.Â  \r\n  See Evans v. Taylor Made Sandwich Co., 337 S.C. 95, 100, 522 S.E.2d \r\n  350, 352 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œThe amount of unpaid wages may be trebled and costs \r\n  and attorneyâ€™s fees may be added pursuant to the Act.â€).Â  \r\n5.Â  CLM asserts the trial court lacked jurisdiction \r\n  to enter an order prohibiting CLM from seeking disbursement of the escrowed \r\n  accounts.Â  We disagree.\r\nPrior to the sale of the dealership to \r\n  Sonic, CLM entered into two escrow agreements covering a portion of the proceeds \r\n  of the sale of assets.Â  One of the escrow agreements is held with the Chicago \r\n  Title Insurance Company in Illinois and the other agreement is with the First \r\n  Union National Bank in North Carolina.Â  The North Carolina escrow agreement \r\n  was entered into to cover claims Shuman and Conway had brought against CLM.Â  \r\n  The Chicago agreement contained funds set aside for contingent environmental \r\n  liabilities associated with the dealership property and contained the following \r\n  provisions:Â  (1) the agreement would be governed by the applicable laws of South \r\n  Carolina, (2) the parties submitted to personal jurisdiction in South Carolina, \r\n  and (3) the parties â€œwaive[d] any and all rights under the laws of any other \r\n  state to object to jurisdiction within the State of South Carolina.â€Â  Because \r\n  of the impending appeal and the concern that funds would not be available to \r\n  pay the final judgment, the trial court ordered CLM not to distribute the balance \r\n  of the funds without the courtâ€™s approval, although certain designated expenditures \r\n  were exempted.Â  \r\nWe find the trial courtâ€™s order merely prohibited \r\n  CLM from making a request to disburse the funds for any purpose other than those \r\n  specifically authorized by the escrow agreements.Â  Contrary to CLMâ€™s assertion, \r\n  the trial court did not merge the funds or make any orders directly affecting \r\n  the balance in the funds.Â  Moreover, as Shuman points out, one of the agreements \r\n  expressly consented to jurisdiction in South Carolina and the court had jurisdiction \r\n  over the parties in this action.Â  We therefore find no error in the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  order regarding the escrow agreements.\r\n6.Â  Shuman argues the trial court erred in failing \r\n  to provide him with prejudgment interest on the $175,000 judgment because it \r\n  was a sum certain.Â  We find no error.\r\nâ€œThe law allows prejudgment interest on \r\n  obligations to pay money from the time when, either by agreement of the parties \r\n  or operation of law, the payment is demandable, if the sum is certain or capable \r\n  of being reduced to certainty.â€Â  Babb v. Rothrock, 310 S.C. 350, 353, \r\n  426 S.E.2d 789, 791 (1993).Â  Here, the issue of whether Shuman was entitled \r\n  to any damages was heavily disputed between the parties and was not clear from \r\n  the partiesâ€™ agreements.Â  CLM disputed the existence of the agreements on which \r\n  Shuman based his claims for breach of contract and failure to pay wages, alleging \r\n  Conway lacked the authority to enter into the agreements on its behalf.Â  CLM \r\n  also disputed the amount of any severance pay due to Shuman and the parties \r\n  disagreed on whether any net profit was due on the sale of the business as well \r\n  as its method of calculation.Â  Under the circumstances, the amount of severance \r\n  and unpaid wages that Shuman may have been entitled to was not readily ascertainable, \r\n  as was evidenced by the jury award, which was somewhere in between the amounts \r\n  argued to the jury; therefore, he was not entitled to prejudgment interest.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n7.Â  Shuman asserts the trial court erred in finding \r\n  the amount the jury awarded him for unpaid wages was included in the amount \r\n  the jury awarded for his contract claim.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn charging the jury, the trial court \r\n  explained that Shumanâ€™s claims for breach of contract and failure to pay wages \r\n  overlapped because both included Shumanâ€™s claim of $65,000 in unpaid salary \r\n  and the possible $325,350 he claimed was owed to him as incentive pay.Â  The \r\n  trial court further stated to the jury:Â  â€œIf you find that he is entitled to \r\n  any of that money on both of the claims, he wonâ€™t be paid twice.â€Â  The jury \r\n  returned two verdict forms.Â  The first form stated:Â  â€œWe find [CLM] knowingly \r\n  failed to pay [Shuman] wages due him as required by law in the amount of $65,000.00 \r\n  Dollars.â€Â  The second form stated:Â  â€œWe find [CLM] broke the contract of employment \r\n  and must pay [Shuman] $175,000 Dollars actual damages.â€Â  \r\nWe find that, in light of the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  instructions to the jury and the language of the two verdict forms, the trial \r\n  court correctly found that the amount the jury awarded Shuman for his wage claim \r\n  was included in the amount awarded for the breach of contract claim.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm all of the trial courtâ€™s rulings \r\n  with the exception of its doubling of the juryâ€™s award for unpaid wages, which \r\n  we reverse and remand upon our finding that the Payment of Wages Act only provides \r\n  a trial court with the discretion to award either treble damages or no additional \r\n  damages.Â  Upon remand, the trial court shall use the existing record in making \r\n  its determination and should give the basis for its ruling.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nGOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  CLM also includes Haywood B.

Weldon and Janice A. Cannan, both of Conway, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nJames Thomas Young, of Conway, for Respondent Conway National \r\n  Bank.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Samuel Page filed a complaint \r\n  seeking to set aside a property transaction between S. M. Page and Willard Page.Â  \r\n  Samuel argued the transaction was invalid because he was not offered a right \r\n  of first refusal to the property.Â  The master refused to set aside the transfer.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nM. K. Page and Maude Page conveyed a parcel \r\n  of real estate to S. M. Page, in fee simple absolute, reserving a life estate \r\n  unto themselves.Â  In the deed, M. K. and Maude placed a restriction on S. M. \r\n  Pageâ€™s right to dispose of the property.Â  The restriction created a right of \r\n  first refusal as follows:Â  \r\nIn the event S. M. Page decides to sell all or any portion \r\n  of this property, it shall first be offered to Betsy Page Flinn, Carolyn Page \r\n  Eaton, and Samuel D. Page under the same terms and conditions as the proposed \r\n  sale.Â  This restriction, on transfer, shall also apply to any heirs of S. M. \r\n  Page.\r\nThe reserved life estate expired upon \r\n  Maudeâ€™s death in 1993 and S. M. Page took possession of the property.Â  In 1995, \r\n  S. M. Page conveyed the property to Willard Page without first offering the \r\n  property to any of the persons identified in the deed from M. K. and Maude as \r\n  having a right of first refusal.Â  There was no mention of the right of first \r\n  refusal clause in the deed to Willard.Â  A little more than five years after \r\n  that conveyance, Willard encumbered the property with a $10,000 mortgage in \r\n  favor of Conway National Bank.Â  \r\nSamuel, one of the individuals to whom \r\n  the right of first refusal was granted, sued Willard, S. M. Page, and Conway \r\n  National Bank seeking to set aside the conveyance, alleging he was not offered \r\n  the opportunity to purchase the property before it was conveyed to Willard.Â  \r\n  The matter was referred to the master in equity with finality.Â  The master declined \r\n  to set aside the transaction, reasoning that the right of first refusal language \r\n  contained in the deed from M. K. and Maude to S. M. Page was invalid because \r\n  it was an attempt to cut down a fee simple with subsequent language in the deed.Â  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSamuel argues the master erred when he refused \r\n  to set aside the conveyance from S. M. Page to Willard.Â  He asserts the right \r\n  of first refusal language contained in the deed was a preemptive right that \r\n  did not cut short a fee simple absolute estate.Â  Additionally, he contends the \r\n  master failed to consider the deed as a whole.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\nOne of the first canons of construction of a deed is that \r\n  the intention of the grantor must be ascertained and effectuated if no settled \r\n  rule of law is contravened.Â  In arriving at such intention, the deed must be \r\n  construed as a whole, and effect given to every part, if such can be done consistently \r\n  with law.Â  \r\n\r\nSouthern Ry. Co. v. Smoak, 243 S.C. 331, \r\n  336, 133 S.E.2d 806, 808 (1963).Â  However, when a granting clause in a deed \r\n  purports to convey a fee simple absolute title, any subsequent provisions in \r\n  the deed diminishing or depriving the grantee of rights incident to owning the \r\n  property in fee simple are invalid.Â  Shealy v. South Carolina Elec. &amp; \r\n  Gas Co., 278 S.C. 132, 135, 293 S.E.2d 306, 308 (1982).Â  Thus we must decide \r\n  whether the right of first refusal in the deed S. M. Page received diminished \r\n  any of the rights attendant to the fee simple title conveyed in the deedâ€™s granting \r\n  clause.Â  \r\nA right of first refusal is a pre-emptive right.Â  \r\n  Webb v. Reames, 326 S.C. 444, 446, 485 S.E.2d 384, 385 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  \r\n  The right of first refusal is a contingent nonvested interest because the grantee \r\n  or the granteeâ€™s heir might never choose to sell the property.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  It is an interest predicated on an event which is not certain to occur.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  Pre-emptive rights are subject to the rule against restraint of alienation of \r\n  interest in land.Â  61 Am. Jur. 2d Perpetuities and Restraints on Alienation \r\n  Â§ 110 (2002).Â  Under some circumstances, a right of first refusal may not be \r\n  an unreasonable restriction on alienation.Â  â€œA right of first refusal . . . \r\n  is not a restraint on alienation, as long as both the price that the designated \r\n  person must pay, and the time allowed for the exercise of the right of first \r\n  refusal are reasonable.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nâ€œWhether a right of first refusal is valid depends \r\n  on the legitimacy of the purpose, the price at which the holder may purchase \r\n  the land, and the procedures for exercising the right.â€Â  Restatement (Third) \r\n  of Prop.:Â  Servitude Â§ 3.4 cmt. (f) (2000).Â  According to the testimony, the \r\n  purpose of the restriction in this case was primarily to retain the property \r\n  in the family, which is a legitimate purpose.Â  Also, the language contained \r\n  in the operative deed fixed the price that must be paid by requiring that it \r\n  be the same as contained in the offer from a potential third party purchaser.Â  \r\n  However, the procedures for exercising the right of first refusal are not specifically \r\n  spelled out in the grant itself, leaving unanswered the question as to how long \r\n  the right to exercise the right of first refusal must remain open and how long \r\n  thereafter the holder of the right had to consummate the transaction.Â  \r\n\r\nLengthy periods for exercise of rights of first refusal will \r\n  . . . substantially affect alienability of the property.Â  Potential buyers will \r\n  be deterred by the possibility that they may not know for a lengthy period of \r\n  time whether they will obtain the property or be obligated to pay the price.Â  \r\n  The risks of change in their needs and in financial markets will be greater \r\n  than most buyers will be willing to accept.\r\n\r\nId.Â  We are therefore constrained to conclude \r\n  that the lack of specificity in the language of the right of first refusal creates \r\n  an unreasonable restraint on the alienability of the property.Â  \r\nWe adopt a rule of strict construction in this \r\n  case for two basic reasons.Â  The first is that South Carolina has a long line \r\n  of cases strongly expressing disfavor for subsequent clauses in deeds that purport \r\n  to cut down a fee simple estate contained in the granting clause.Â  See \r\n  Sandford v. Sandford, 106 S.C. 304, 306, 91 S.E. 294, 295 (1917) (â€œIt \r\n  is . . . clear (and no citation of authorities is necessary) that an attempt \r\n  to convey an estate in fee simple and deprive the purchaser of the incident \r\n  of ownership is not effective in law.â€); see also Douglas v. Medical \r\n  Investors, Inc., 256 S.C. 440, 445, 182 S.E.2d 720, 722 (1971) (noting â€œthe \r\n  well established principle that when the granting clause in a deed conveys a \r\n  fee simple title it cannot be reduced or cut down by subsequent language in \r\n  the instrumentâ€); Stylecraft, Inc. v. Thomas, 250 S.C. 495, 498, 159 \r\n  S.E.2d 46, 47 (1968) (same); Batesburg-Leesville School Dist. No. 3 v. Tarrant, \r\n  293 S.C. 442, 444, 361 S.E.2d 343, 345 (Ct. App. 1987) (same).Â  The second is \r\n  that any restraint on alienation in the form of a right of first refusal that \r\n  is not specific in all required elements â€“ legitimacy of purpose, price, and \r\n  detailed procedures â€“ runs counter to the commonly acknowledged concept in this \r\n  state that one of the attributes of fee simple ownership is the ability to freely \r\n  convey it with few if any restrictions.Â  Having held that the right of first \r\n  refusal in this case constitutes an unreasonable limitation upon the power of \r\n  alienation, it is therefore violative of the public policy of this state and \r\n  has no force and effect.Â  McCravey v. Otts, 90 S.C. 447, 452, 74 S.E. \r\n  142, 143 (1912); Wise v. Poston, 281 S.C. 574, 579, 316 S.E.2d 412, 415 \r\n  (Ct.

Phillips (Mother), James Calvin Phillips, Jr. (James), \r\n  Donna V. Phillips Cassidy (Donna) and Richard Allen Phillips (Richard) owned \r\n  an undivided interest in a tract of land.Â  Father, Mother, and James (collectively, \r\n  â€œRespondentsâ€) filed a complaint against Richard and Donna (collectively, â€œAppellantsâ€) \r\n  seeking the partition in-kind of the tract.Â  A special referee filed both a \r\n  Report and Decree of Partition of Real Estate and a supplemental order.Â  Appellants \r\n  now appeal, arguing the supplemental order was contrary to an agreement reached \r\n  by the parties.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellants and Respondents owned, \r\n  as tenants in common, a 645-acre tract of land in Chesterfield County.Â Â  Respondents, \r\n  seeking a partition in-kind of the land, filed both a complaint and lis \r\n  pendens in the circuit court.Â Â  By consent of the parties, the action \r\n  was referred to a special referee. \r\nThe special referee conducted two hearings.Â  \r\n  At the first hearing, the parties stipulated that Father and Mother were entitled \r\n  to a combined sixty percent interest in the tract and each of the children was \r\n  entitled to a ten percent interest.Â Â  Father and James testified at the hearing \r\n  that they were seeking a partition to allow James fifty acres in the northern \r\n  corner of the property on which to build a poultry farm.Â  \r\nAt the second hearing, the parties informed \r\n  the special referee of their agreement that James receive the fifty acres for \r\n  the poultry farm in the northern corner of the property.Â Â  Counsel for Appellants \r\n  informed the referee that as part of that agreement, Appellants would receive \r\n  their joint portion of the land along the highway.Â Â  Counsel for Respondents \r\n  agreed that Appellants could get their portion in the southwestern corner of \r\n  the tract, but he informed the special referee that the court would have to \r\n  decide the dimensions of their portion, including how much road frontage the \r\n  parties would receive. \r\nFather testified several times that the special referee \r\n  would have to determine the dimensions of Appellantsâ€™ joint tract.Â  Appellants \r\n  presented a proposed division that included mostly road frontage.Â Â  They testified \r\n  they wanted Father to have the rental properties in the southwestern corner \r\n  and to be compensated with other land.Â Â  Donna testified the special referee \r\n  could determine the percentage of road frontage property she and Richard should \r\n  receive.Â Â Â  Richard also informed the referee that he â€œhad no strong feelingsâ€ \r\n  about the road frontage property, but he did not want the rental property.Â Â Â  \r\n  At the end of the hearing, counsel for Respondents excepted to Appellants receiving \r\n  the majority of the road frontage property and requested that the referee give \r\n  them a proportionate share of land fronting the highway.Â Â Â  \r\nThe special referee subsequently entered a Report \r\n  and Decree of Partition of Real Estate.Â  In the order, the special referee outlined \r\n  the partiesâ€™ agreements that Appellants would receive their undivided interest \r\n  in the southwestern corner of the property, James would have the fifty acres \r\n  for his poultry farm, and Father would receive any rental property and one acre \r\n  surrounding it that may lie within Appellantsâ€™ portion.Â Â  The special referee \r\n  found Appellants should be allotted a 129-acre portion of land (twenty percent \r\n  of the overall tract) in the southwest corner of the property in order to satisfy \r\n  their interests.Â Â  The referee explained the method to be employed in determining \r\n  the dimensions of this tract and stated he would retain jurisdiction to â€œcoordinate \r\n  and effectuate the laying out of the portion allotted to [Appellants] and to \r\n  enter such further order as will facilitate the conclusion of this matter.â€ \r\n  [1] Â Â  \r\nSeveral months after the Report and Decree of Partition \r\n  was entered, the special referee filed a supplemental order approving a surveyorâ€™s \r\n  plat of the 129-acre tract allotted to Appellants.Â Â  The referee stated that, \r\n  as a result of the allotment, Appellants received â€œownership of a pro \r\n  rata share of the whole acreage relative to both land and type, (e.g. \r\n  road frontage, planted pines, pasture, bottom land, and river frontage).â€Â Â  \r\n  Appellants subsequently filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion for reconsideration, \r\n  arguing the division of land approved by the special referee was contrary to \r\n  the partiesâ€™ agreement.Â Â  The referee denied the motion, stating there was no \r\n  evidence of such an agreement in the record. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œA partition action is an equitable action, \r\n  heard by a judge alone and, as such, this Court on review may find facts in \r\n  accordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Anderson \r\n  v. Anderson, 299 S.C. 110, 113, 382 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1989).Â  This scope \r\n  of review does not require this Court to ignore the special refereeâ€™s findings \r\n  when he was in a â€œbetter position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses.â€Â  \r\n  In re Thames, 344 S.C. 564, 571, 544 S.E.2d 854, 857 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants argue the special referee \r\n  erred in issuing a supplemental order contrary to his prior order and contrary \r\n  to the recognized agreement of the parties.\r\nInitially, we note there is no evidence \r\n  in the record of any kind of an agreement reached between the parties concerning \r\n  the specific allocation of property to Appellants within the tract.Â  While Appellants \r\n  and Respondents appear to have reached a consensus that Appellants were to receive \r\n  a 129-acre tract in the southwestern corner of the overall tract and that this \r\n  tract should have a proportional amount of road frontage, there is neither testimony \r\n  nor a written document memorializing a formal agreement that Appellants would \r\n  only receive road frontage or that they would not receive river frontage.Â  Agreements \r\n  between counsel are not binding unless they are reduced to written form or â€œmade \r\n  in open court and noted upon the record.â€Â  Rule 43(k), SCRCP; see Young \r\n  v. Cooler, 347 S.C. 362, 365, 555 S.E.2d 410, 412 (Ct. App. 2001) (holding \r\n  it was error for the trial court to enforce an â€œagreementâ€ where there was no \r\n  evidence of a consent order, written stipulation, or agreement made in open \r\n  court and noted on the record).Â  Because there is no evidence of an agreement, \r\n  the special refereeâ€™s supplemental order was not issued in violation of any \r\n  agreement.\r\nFurther, there is nothing in the record indicating \r\n  the special refereeâ€™s supplemental order violated the terms in the initial order.Â  \r\n  The initial order noted the parties agreed Appellants would receive 129 acres \r\n  in the southwestern portion of the overall tract.Â  The parties agreed the special \r\n  referee would retain jurisdiction to lay out Appellantsâ€™ portion after consulting \r\n  with a surveyor.Â  In the supplemental order, the special referee specifically \r\n  outlined Appellantsâ€™ portion pursuant to the surveyorâ€™s plat. Accordingly, nothing \r\n  in the record indicates the special refereeâ€™s supplemental order violated the \r\n  terms of the original order. \r\nFinally, the partiesâ€™ testimony does not indicate \r\n  the special referee erred in partitioning the property.Â  Respondents specifically \r\n  stated they wanted the referee to establish the dimensions of Appellantsâ€™ tract \r\n  in the southwestern corner of the property.Â Â  Although Richard indicated he \r\n  had no interest in farming the river-front property, Appellants testified they \r\n  wanted the special referee to determine the location of their share of the property, \r\n  to consider the inclusion of several rental properties on the tract, and to \r\n  apportion road frontage proportional to their percentage ownership of the overall \r\n  tract of land.Â Â Â  Respondents agreed the special referee should make a determination \r\n  regarding a proportional amount of road frontage.Â  \r\nThe special referee fairly apportioned Appellantsâ€™ \r\n  land consistent with the intent of both parties.Â  We note that, in dividing \r\n  the tract, the special referee took great pains to award Appellants a fair and \r\n  pro rata share of all of the different types of land in the tract \r\n  â€“ including road frontage, planted pines, pasture, bottom land, and river frontage. \r\n  Â Â Further, the evidence in the record indicates the partiesâ€™ only agreement \r\n  was for the special referee to make the specific determination on the location \r\n  of Appellantsâ€™ portion.Â  Accordingly, the special refereeâ€™s supplemental order \r\n  did not conflict with the original order.Â  Based on the preponderance of the \r\n  evidence before this Court, we find the special referee did not err in apportioning \r\n  the tract or issuing his supplemental order.Â  Anderson, 299 S.C. at 113, \r\n  382 S.E.2d at 899.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased upon the foregoing, the special refereeâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nGOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., and CURETON, AJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  In the Report and Decree of Partition, the special referee also noted \r\n    the partiesâ€™ stipulated value of the entire tract and levied costs to be paid \r\n    by the parties.Â  Â These conclusions were not appealed by either party.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-112","title":"State v.

Taggart, of Columbia, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nDeputy Director for Legal Services Teresa A. Knox, Legal Counsel \r\n  Tommy Evans, Jr. and Legal Counsel J. Benjamin Aplin, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â  Charles W. Bailey \r\n  was indicted for unlawful possession of prescription drugs and resisting arrest \r\n  and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence pursuant to Section 5(c) of the Youthful \r\n  Offender Act, suspended upon four-years probation and payment of restitution \r\n  in the amount of sixty dollars.Â  Subsequently, an arrest warrant was issued \r\n  against Bailey for violation of his probation.Â  Thereafter, the circuit court \r\n  revoked Baileyâ€™s probation, modified the sentence from Youthful Offender to \r\n  an adult sentence of two-years imprisonment, and revoked the sentence in full.Â  \r\n  Bailey appeals, arguing the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to revoke his probation as to his conviction for resisting arrest.Â  We affirm \r\n  in part, vacate in part, and remand.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nBailey was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence \r\n  under Section 5(c) of the Youthful Offender Act, suspended upon four-years probation \r\n  and payment of restitution in the amount of sixty dollars.Â  The sentence was \r\n  given in disposition of two indictments, 96-GS-46-2868, charging Unlawful Possession \r\n  of Prescription Drugs, and 96-GS-46-2869, charging Resisting Arrest.\r\nSubsequently, an arrest warrant was issued \r\n  against Bailey for violating his probation by: 1) failing to follow the advice \r\n  of a probation agent; 2) failing to gain approval of an agent before moving \r\n  out of state; 3) failing to maintain monetary obligations; and 4) failing to \r\n  contact a South Carolina agent for transfer to New Hampshire, therebyÂ  absconding \r\n  from the jurisdiction.Â  The warrant referred solely to indictment 96-GS-46-2868.Â  \r\n  At the conclusion of the probation revocation hearing, the circuit court revoked \r\n  Baileyâ€™s probation, modified the sentence from Youthful Offender to an adult \r\n  sentence of two-years imprisonment, and revoked the sentence in full.Â  The written \r\n  order revoking probation referred to the charges contained in both indictments.Â  \r\n  Bailey appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBailey argues the circuit court lacked \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction to revoke his probation on indictment 96-46-GS-2869 \r\n  because the arrest warrant only referred to indictment 96-GS-46-2868.Â  We agree \r\n  and vacate the portion of the order referring to indictment 96-46-GS-2869.Â  \r\n\r\nâ€œSubject matter jurisdiction to revoke an individualâ€™s \r\n  probation is conferred on the General Sessions Court by either the issuance \r\n  of a probation violation warrant or the issuance of a probation violation citation \r\n  and affidavit in lieu of a warrant.â€Â  State v. Lee, 350 S.C. 125, 132, \r\n  564 S.E.2d 372, 376 (Ct. App. 2002); see State v. Felder, 313 \r\n  S.C. 55, 56, 437 S.E.2d 42, 43 (1993) (â€œSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-450 \r\n  (1989), [1]  requires the issuance of a probation revocation \r\n  warrant before probation may be revoked.Â  If a warrant has not been issued, \r\n  the trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to revoke probation and any \r\n  attempted revocation is a nullity.Â  South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-300 (1989), \r\n  however, permits the use of a citation and affidavit in lieu of a warrant.â€ \r\n  (internal citations omitted)).\r\nNo evidence exists within the record indicating \r\n  an arrest warrant was issued charging Bailey with a violation of his probationary \r\n  sentence under indictment 96-46-GS-2869.Â  Furthermore, the State concedes no \r\n  arrest warrant was issued on that indictment.Â  \r\nThus, the circuit court lacked subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction to revoke Baileyâ€™s probation as to indictment 96-46-GS-2869.Â  \r\n  See Lee, 350 S.C. at 132, 564 S.E.2d at 376.Â  Accordingly, the \r\n  modification and revocation of Baileyâ€™s sentence given in connection with indictment \r\n  96-GS-46-2869 by Order of Judge John C. Hayes on November 4, 2002, is hereby \r\n  vacated.Â  \r\nBased on the arrest warrant issued, the \r\n  circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction to revoke Baileyâ€™s probation and \r\n  to modify his sentence as it related to indictment 96-GS-46-2868.Â  However, \r\n  instead of modifying Baileyâ€™s sentence as it related to this one charge, the \r\n  circuit court modified the single sentence given for both indictments at trial.Â  \r\n  Thus, we remand for a determination of Baileyâ€™s modified sentence relating only \r\n  to indictment 96-GS-46-2868.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the circuit \r\n  court, revoking Baileyâ€™s probation is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, and REMANDED.Â  \r\nGOOLSBY, HOWARD and KITTREDGE, JJ., \r\n  concurring.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Although section 24-21-450 was amended in 1991, the amendment does \r\n    not affect our analysis of the issue of subject matter jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-115","title":"State v.

Marvin Mullis, \r\n  Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent/Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â  Donnie L. Williams, \r\n  Jr., sued Pioneer Machinery, Inc., (â€œPioneerâ€), and Blount, Inc., (â€œBlountâ€), \r\n  alleging causes of action for strict tort liability, negligence, and breach \r\n  of express and implied warranties.Â  Before trial, Pioneer moved for a transfer \r\n  of venue from Florence County to Lexington County.Â  The circuit court granted \r\n  the motion.Â  Subsequently, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Pioneer and \r\n  Blount.Â  Thereafter, Williams moved for a new trial absolute based on the thirteenth \r\n  juror doctrine and Rule 60, South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  The circuit \r\n  court granted Williamsâ€™ motion.Â  All of the parties appealed.Â  Williams appeals, \r\n  arguing the circuit court improperly granted Pioneerâ€™s motion for change of \r\n  venue.Â  Pioneer and Blount appeal, arguing the circuit court improperly granted \r\n  Williamsâ€™ motion for a new trial absolute.Â  We affirm.Â Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nWilliams worked for a logging company trimming \r\n  felled trees to be loaded onto logging trucks.Â  Williams was working in the \r\n  proximity of a Prentice 410D Loader, a piece of heavy logging equipment having \r\n  a boom with a grapple on the end used to pick up, move, and drop felled trees.Â  \r\n  Williams was injured when his co-worker was moving a tree that fell from the \r\n  grapple onto Williams.Â  \r\nWilliams sued Pioneer, the seller of the loader \r\n  truck, and Blount, the manufacturer of the loader truck (collectively â€œthe Defendantsâ€), \r\n  in Florence County, alleging causes of action for strict tort liability, negligence, \r\n  and breach of express and implied warranties.Â  Williams maintained the 410D \r\n  Loader was defective because the boom obstructed the view of the operator, thereby \r\n  creating a blind spot.Â  \r\nBefore trial, the Defendants moved to transfer \r\n  venue from Florence County to Lexington County, arguing the convenience of the \r\n  witnesses and the interests of justice required the transfer.Â  The circuit court \r\n  granted the change of venue, and the case was tried in Lexington County.Â  \r\nWilliams introduced the testimony of an expert \r\n  witness who testified that visibility from the driverâ€™s seat of the loader truck \r\n  was limited.Â  However, the expert and the attorneys realized during a recess \r\n  that a different loader, a 410E model, had been produced by the Defendants for \r\n  inspection prior to trial, and the expert witness had based his opinion on a \r\n  410E loader truck having a different sized boom.Â  \r\nWhen Williamsâ€™ counsel brought the pre-trial discovery \r\n  mistake to the attention of the circuit court, the court stated it would allow \r\n  the expert to be recalled during rebuttal after inspecting the correct loader.Â  \r\n  No motion for mistrial was made or considered by the court.Â  \r\nThereafter, the correct loader model was displayed \r\n  for the jury to examine and to sit in the operatorâ€™s seat.Â  The trial judge \r\n  did not sit in the loader truck.Â  \r\nIn rebuttal, Williamsâ€™ expert noted the \r\n  smaller size of the 410D boom but explained that it made no difference in his \r\n  opinion regarding the restriction on operator visibility or the manufacturerâ€™s \r\n  ability to reduce the risk of harm by installing a mirror.Â  Â  \r\nAt the close of the trial, Williams withdrew his \r\n  causes of action for breach of warranties.Â  Furthermore, on motion for directed \r\n  verdict by the Defendants, the circuit court granted a directed verdict as to \r\n  Pioneer on the negligence cause of action.\r\nThereafter, the jury returned a verdict in favor \r\n  of the Defendants.Â  Williams moved the circuit court for a new trial absolute, \r\n  arguing the result of the trial was unjust and based upon mistake because of \r\n  the confusion caused by the initial testimony regarding the 410E loader.Â  The \r\n  circuit court granted Williamsâ€™ motion for a new trial based on both the thirteenth \r\n  juror doctrine and Rule 60(b), South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  Both \r\n  Williams and the Defendants appeal.Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Williamsâ€™ Appeal\r\nWilliams argues the circuit court erred by granting \r\n  Pioneerâ€™s motion for change of venue.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe circuit court retains the sound discretion \r\n  to change the venue of a trial if to do so both furthers the convenience of \r\n  witnesses and the ends of justice.Â  McKissick v. J.F. Cleckley &amp; Co., \r\n  325 S.C. 327, 335, 479 S.E.2d 67, 71 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  A circuit courtâ€™s decision \r\n  to change venue based on these two factors will not be disturbed absent a showing \r\n  of â€œmanifest abuse of discretion resulting in an error of law.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n  â€œMoreover, the error of law must be so opposed to the trial judgeâ€™s sound discretion \r\n  as to amount to a deprivation of the legal rights of the party.â€ Id. \r\n \r\n\r\nWhere a party moves for a change of venue based \r\n  on convenience and the ends of justice, the circuit court is charged with resolving \r\n  questions of fact to determine whether a change satisfies both requirements.Â  \r\n  A great deal of discretion is left to the circuit court to determine whether \r\n  the witnessesâ€™ convenience would be promoted by the change.Â  The question to \r\n  be resolved is whether convenience and justice would be promoted, not to what \r\n  degree.Â  Id.\r\nâ€œThe movant has the burden of making a \r\n  prima facie showing that both the convenience of the witnesses and the ends \r\n  of justice would be promoted by the change.â€Â  Id. (quoting Brice v. \r\n  State Co., 193 S.C. 137, 139-40, 7 S.E.2d 850, 851 (1940)).Â Â  â€œAlthough \r\n  both requirements must be met, a showing of the convenience of the witnesses \r\n  can, depending on the facts of the case, bear on the issue of promotion of justice.â€Â  \r\n  McKissick, 325 S.C. at 335, 479 S.E.2d at 71.\r\nWhile a precise definition of the â€œends of justiceâ€ \r\n  is hard to elucidate, we acknowledge that justice is promoted by having the \r\n  â€œcredibility of witnesses judged by jurors of the vicinage, the county in which \r\n  the witnesses reside.â€ Id. at 335-36, 479 S.E.2d at 71.Â  \r\nThe record indicates the loader was bought from \r\n  Pioneer in Lexington County, the incident occurred in Lexington County, and \r\n  Williams, the plaintiff, is a resident of Lexington County.Â  \r\nFurthermore, in support of its motion to change \r\n  venue, Pioneer submitted the affidavits of four potential witnesses.Â  The first \r\n  affiant, Joseph Garner Scott, the owner of Pioneer, testified he was a resident \r\n  of Lexington County, and as such, Lexington County was a more convenient forum \r\n  for him.Â  Additionally, he testified he was the trial representative for Pioneer \r\n  and was required to be present throughout the trial.Â  He averred that if anyone \r\n  would be testifying on behalf of Pioneer about the sale of the loader and the \r\n  subsequent maintenance and repair of the loader, it would be him.Â  Moreover, \r\n  he averred Pioneerâ€™s principal place of business was in Lexington County, and \r\n  if any of his employees were called to testify, the majority of them lived in \r\n  Lexington County.Â  \r\nThe second affiant, Tracey Gunter, averred he is \r\n  the owner of the logging company Williams works for, and as such, he owns the \r\n  loader truck that injured Williams.Â  He lives and works in Lexington County.Â  \r\n  Additionally, he stated that the majority of his employees work in Lexington \r\n  County and it would be more convenient for him if the trial were held there.Â  \r\n\r\nThe third affiant, Edwin Oâ€™Neil Padgett, averred \r\n  he is a resident of Lexington County, he witnessed the accident, and it would \r\n  be more convenient for him if the trial were held in Lexington County.Â  \r\nThe fourth affiant, Dale Gleaton, averred he was \r\n  the operator of the loader at the time Williams was injured, and it would be \r\n  more convenient for him if the trial were in Lexington County. \r\n  [1] Â  \r\nReviewing the affidavits and testimony within the \r\n  record, sufficient evidence exists to support the circuit courtâ€™s ruling that \r\n  both the convenience of the witnesses and the ends of justice would be promoted \r\n  by changing venue from Florence County to Lexington County.Â  Thus, we hold the \r\n  circuit court did not abuse its discretion.Â  See McKissick, 325 \r\n  S.C. at 327, 479 S.E.2d at 71 (holding a circuit courtâ€™s decision to change \r\n  venue will not be disturbed absent a showing of manifest abuse of discretion \r\n  amounting to a deprivation of the legal rights of a party). \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  The Defendantsâ€™ Appeal\r\nThe Defendants argue the circuit court erred by \r\n  granting Williamsâ€™ motion for a new trial absolute based on the thirteenth juror \r\n  doctrine.Â  We disagree. [2] \r\nThe thirteenth juror doctrine permits the circuit \r\n  court to grant a new trial absolute when it finds the evidence does not justify \r\n  the verdict.Â  South Carolina Highway Depâ€™t v. Townsend, 265 S.C. 253, \r\n  258, 217 S.E.2d 778, 781 (1975).Â  The effect is the same as if the jury failed \r\n  to reach a verdict, and thus, the circuit court is not required to give any \r\n  reason for granting the new trial. Folkens v. Hunt, 300 S.C. 251, 254, \r\n  387 S.E.2d 265, 266 (1990).Â  Rather, assuming evidence exists to support the \r\n  circuit courtâ€™s order, the circuit court â€œjudge . . . [, sitting as] the thirteenth \r\n  juror, possess[es] the veto power to the Nth degree . . .â€Â  Worrell v. South \r\n  Carolina Power Co., 186 S.C. 306, 313-14, 195 S.E. 638, 641 (1938).Â Â  Therefore, \r\n  a circuit courtâ€™s order granting or denying a new trial upon the facts will \r\n  not be disturbed unless its decision is wholly unsupported by the evidence or \r\n  the conclusion reached was controlled by an error of law.Â  South Carolina \r\n  State Highway Depâ€™t v. Clarkson, 267 S.C. 121, 126, 226 S.E.2d 696, 697 \r\n  (1976).Â  \r\nThe Defendants contend the circuit court erred \r\n  by granting a new trial absolute because the blind spot caused by the loaderâ€™s \r\n  boom is an open and obvious danger under any view of the evidence.Â  Therefore, \r\n  they contend the circuit court was barred, as a matter of law, from sitting \r\n  as a thirteenth juror.\r\nAs we view the Defendantsâ€™ argument, it is based \r\n  upon an erroneous understanding of the law.Â  In order to recover under a strict \r\n  liability theory, the plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) the defendantâ€™s product \r\n  was in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous for its intended use; (2) \r\n  the defect existed when the product left the defendantâ€™s control; and (3) the \r\n  defect was the proximate cause of the injury sustained.Â  Bragg v. Hi-Ranger, \r\n  Inc., 319 S.C. 531, 539, 462 S.E.2d 321, 326 (Ct. App. 1995).\r\nAlthough it is true a product cannot be deemed \r\n  unreasonably dangerous for failure to warn of a danger that is open and \r\n  obvious, [3]  a balancing \r\n  test is generally employed to determine if a product is designed in an \r\n  unreasonably dangerous manner.Â  In that vein, the following factors are considered \r\n  to determine if a design defect exists:Â  1) the usefulness and desirability \r\n  of the product; 2) the cost involved for added safety; 3) the likelihood and \r\n  potential seriousness of the injury; and 4) the obviousness of the danger.Â  \r\n  Claytor v. General Motors Corp., 227 S.C. 259, 265, 286 S.E.2d 129, 132 \r\n  (1982).Â  Therefore, in South Carolina we balance the utility of the risk inherent \r\n  in the design of the product with the magnitude of the risk to determine the \r\n  reasonableness of the manufacturerâ€™s action in designing the product.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\n\r\nWilliamsâ€™ complaint alleges the loader was unreasonably \r\n  dangerous because:Â  1) it was designed in an unreasonably dangerous manner; \r\n  and 2) the manufacturer failed to give adequate warnings.Â  Both the operator \r\n  of the loader and Williams testified they knew the loader had a blind spot at \r\n  the four oâ€™clock position.Â  Thus, at most, the Defendants have demonstrated \r\n  a lack of evidence to support allegations of a failure to warn.Â  However, \r\n  Williamsâ€™ theory of the case encompassed more than just defective warnings, \r\n  as it also alleged the loader was designed in an unreasonably dangerous \r\n  manner.Â  \r\nFurthermore, nothing in the circuit courtâ€™s order suggests \r\n  it granted the new trial solely on the theory of a failure to warn.Â  \r\n  Rather, the circuit court did not specify any one basis for its grant of a new \r\n  trial.Â  Consequently, the open and obvious nature of the blind spot was, as \r\n  to the claim for defective design, merely one of the factors to be weighed by \r\n  the factfinder.Â  Therefore, this argument is without merit.\r\nNext, the Defendants argue the circuit \r\n  court erred as a matter of law by granting the new trial absolute based on the \r\n  thirteenth juror doctrine because the judge did not actually sit in the loader.Â  \r\n  Thus, the Defendants contend that where, as here, the judge has not viewed or \r\n  experienced some piece of evidence, the judge is precluded from sitting as a \r\n  thirteenth juror.Â  The Defendants predicate their argument on Townsend, \r\n  265 S.C. at 253, 217 S.E.2d at 778.\r\n In Townsend, the South Carolina Highway \r\n  Department (â€œSCHDâ€) instituted a condemnation proceeding against the defendant.Â  \r\n  As part of the evidence at trial, the jury was permitted to view the property \r\n  the SCHD sought to condemn.Â  The circuit court judge did not view the property.Â  \r\n\r\nThereafter, following the juryâ€™s verdict in favor \r\n  of the defendant, SCHD moved for a new trial absolute or, in the alternative, \r\n  a new trial nisi remittitur.Â  The circuit court judge denied the motion for \r\n  a new trial absolute, stating that although he believed the jury award was excessive, \r\n  he was without legal authority to reduce the judgment because the jury viewed \r\n  the premises and he had not.\r\nOn appeal, our supreme court reversed and remanded, \r\n  holding the circuit court judge should view the property and then determine \r\n  whether the motion for new trial nisi remittitur should be granted.\r\n Townsend merely stands for the well-established \r\n  proposition the circuit court commits an error of law where it fails to exercise \r\n  its discretion.Â  Fontaine v. Peitz, 291 S.C. 536, 538, 354 S.E.2d 565, \r\n  566 (1987) (â€œWhen the trial judge is vested with discretion, but his ruling \r\n  reveals no discretion was, in fact, exercised, an error of law has occurred.â€); \r\n  State v. Smith, 276 S.C. 494, 498, 280 S.E.2d 200, 202 (1981) (â€œIt is \r\n  apparent here the sentencing judge did not exercise any discretion but based \r\n  his ruling on an erroneous view of the law. It is an equal abuse of discretion \r\n  to refuse to exercise discretionary authority when it is warranted as it is \r\n  to exercise the discretion improperly.â€).Â  In the case at bar, the circuit court \r\n  judge granted a new trial absolute, ruling justice was not done.Â  Thus, the \r\n  circuit court exercised its discretion.Â  Consequently, we conclude Townsend \r\n  is not controlling here.\r\nFurthermore, conflicting evidence exists within \r\n  the record to support the circuit courtâ€™s decision.Â  Therefore, we hold the \r\n  circuit court did not err by granting a new trial based on the thirteenth juror \r\n  doctrine.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decisions of the \r\n  circuit court are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF, HOWARD, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concurring.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Following Gleatonâ€™s \r\n    original affidavit, Gleaton stated in a subsequent affidavit that he would \r\n    not be unduly burdened or inconvenienced by traveling to Florence and he did \r\n    not want the trial moved â€œon . . .

Davidson, II and Andrew F. Lindemann, bothof Columbia, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: A group of orthopaedic surgeons \r\n  and neurologists (â€œAppellantsâ€) brought an action against the South Carolina \r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (â€œRespondentâ€) and numerous private insurance \r\n  companies alleging they were adversely affected by Respondentâ€™s failure to periodically \r\n  review and amend their medical fee schedule to keep pace with the economy.Â  \r\n  The trial court dismissed Appellantsâ€™ causes of action.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellants are orthopaedic surgeons and neurologists \r\n  licensed to practice medicine in South Carolina.Â  They voluntarily treat injured \r\n  South Carolina employees covered by workersâ€™ compensation insurance.Â  Respondent \r\n  oversees and administers the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§Â§ 42-1-10, et seq. (1985 &amp; Supp. 2003).Â  \r\nIn July 1989, Respondent adopted Regulation 67-1304 \r\n  governing the calculation of physician fees. \r\n  [1] Â  Under Regulation 67-1304, physician fees were determined by first \r\n  assigning a specific unit value, and then multiplying the unit value by the \r\n  current conversion factor.Â  The conversion factor is expressed as a dollar figure \r\n  and is determinative of the allowable fee paid per procedure.Â  The Regulation \r\n  provided:\r\n\r\n  A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The â€œSchedule of Fees for Physicians and Surgeonsâ€ \r\n  (the â€œScheduleâ€) sets forth the criteria for determining a reasonable fee and \r\n  governs determining the maximum fee chargeable.\r\n  \r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Occupational Medicine Committee of the \r\n  South Carolina Medical Association and the Commissionâ€™s Medical Review Division \r\n  reviews the Schedule annually and recommends to the Commission amendments to \r\n  the Schedule.\r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Commission may amend the Schedule as \r\n  necessary.\r\n  \r\n  B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Schedule catalogues and assigns a specific \r\n  unit value to medical procedures listed by code number. \r\n  \r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To determine the maximum fee allowed, locate \r\n  the procedure in the Schedule and determine its unit value.Â  Multiply the unit \r\n  value by the current conversion factor to determine the maximum fee allowed.\r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a procedure is to be determined by â€œindividual \r\n  considerationâ€ or â€œby reportâ€, file a written request with the Commissionâ€™s \r\n  Medical Review Division for determination of the unit value and fee allowed.\r\n  \r\n  C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The conversion factor is a variable factor \r\n  which the Commission periodically amends to keep pace with the economy.Â  Contact \r\n  the Medical Review Division to obtain the current conversion factor.Â  \r\n\r\nIn 1995, Respondent adopted a Medicare-patterned \r\n  Resource Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) with a single conversion factor \r\n  applicable to all procedures, surgical and non-surgical.Â  \r\nAppellants filed this action on June 27, 2000 against \r\n  Respondent and numerous private insurance companies.Â  Appellants filed an amended \r\n  complaint on August 28, 2000.Â  Appellants alleged the Respondent violated a \r\n  statutory duty and denied them equal protection and due process.Â  Specifically, \r\n  Appellants contended Respondent failed to periodically review and amend the \r\n  conversion factor to keep pace with the economy.Â  In addition, they argued the \r\n  RBRVS system, with a single conversion factor for all procedures, surgical and \r\n  non-surgical, was in violation of equal protection and procedural due process.Â  \r\n  The Appellants also asserted a cause of action against the private insurance \r\n  companies for unjust enrichment.Â  \r\nThe trial court ruled the Appellantsâ€™ cause of \r\n  action for violation of a statutory duty failed because the statutory authority \r\n  of the Respondent does not create a private cause of action.Â  It found the Respondent \r\n  did not violate the Appellantsâ€™ rights to equal protection or due process.Â  \r\n  The trial court also dismissed the claims for unjust enrichment against the \r\n  private insurance companies.Â  In addition, the court concluded all of Appellantsâ€™ \r\n  causes of action accrued in 1995 and were barred by the statute of limitations.Â  \r\n  This appeal followed.Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Appellants do not challenge the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  ruling that their causes of action accrued in 1995 and that they brought this \r\n  action after either the two-year statute of limitations found in S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  15-78-110 (Supp. 2003) or the three year statute of limitations found in S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530 (Supp. 2003).Â  The Appellants instead argue Respondent \r\n  is equitably estopped from asserting a statute of limitations defense.Â  We find \r\n  Appellants did not preserve the equitable estoppel issue as it applies to Respondent.Â  \r\n  Appellants did not plead an estoppel issue as to Respondent.Â  The trial courtâ€™s \r\n  order indicates Appellants argued the insurers were equitably estopped \r\n  from asserting the statute of limitations defense.Â  However, there is no evidence \r\n  in the record showing the Appellants argued Respondent was equitably \r\n  estopped from asserting the defense.Â  The trial courtâ€™s order only addressed \r\n  the issue of equitable estoppel as it applies to the insurers.Â  In order for \r\n  an issue to be preserved for appellate review, it must have been raised to and \r\n  ruled upon by the trial judge.Â  Holy Loch Distrib., Inc. v. Hitchcock, \r\n  340 S.C. 20, 24, 531 S.E.2d 282, 284 (2000).Â  Even if the Appellants raised \r\n  the argument to the trial court that the Respondent should be estopped from \r\n  asserting the statute of limitations defense, it failed to raise in a post-trial \r\n  motion the trial courtâ€™s failure to address this issue in its order.Â  Noisette \r\n  v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (finding issue was \r\n  not preserved for appellate review where the trial judge did not explicitly \r\n  rule on the appellantâ€™s argument and the appellant made no Rule 59(e), SCRCP \r\n  motion to alter or amend the judgment).Â  As the Appellantsâ€™ estoppel argument \r\n  is not properly before this court, we may not consider it.Â  \r\nIn the very last line of their brief, the Appellants \r\n  assert â€œthe discovery rule should apply to toll the statute of limitations until \r\n  the time that the Appellants actually became aware of the duty by the Commission \r\n  to periodically adjust their fees to keep pace with the economy, which was in \r\n  the early months of the year 2000.â€Â  This is the Appellantsâ€™ first mention of \r\n  the discovery rule, which is what they argued to the trial court in response \r\n  to the Respondentâ€™s assertion that the statute of limitations barred their claim.Â  \r\n  The Appellants did not set forth this argument in their statement of the issues \r\n  on appeal.Â  We find Appellants failed to properly raise to this court any argument \r\n  they intended to make concerning the discovery rule. See Rule 208(b)(1)(B), \r\n  SCACR (â€œOrdinarily, no point will be considered which is not set forth in the \r\n  statement of the issues on appeal.â€); Langehans v. Smith, 347 S.C. 348, \r\n  352, 554 S.E.2d 681, 683 (Ct. App. 2001) (stating that an issue which is not \r\n  supported by authority or sufficiently argued is not preserved for appellate \r\n  review).\r\nThe trial courtâ€™s determination that the statute of \r\n  limitations had run on Appellantsâ€™ claims against the Respondent because they \r\n  were brought more than three years after they had accrued stands unchallenged \r\n  and constitutes the law of the case. Â See Charleston Lumber Co. v. \r\n  Miller Housing Corp., 338 S.C. 171, 175, 525 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2000) Â (stating \r\n  that as a general rule, an unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, is the law of \r\n  the case and required affirmance.)Â  Accordingly, we must affirm on this ground. \r\n  [2] Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF, STILWELL, and CURETON, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Although subsequently amended by State Register Volume 21, \r\n    Issue No. 6, Part 2, effective June 27, 1997, the applicable language at all \r\n    times pertinent to the present appeal is found in 25A S.C.

Joseph Condon, Jr., of N. Charleston, for Appellants.\r\nBonum Sams Wilson, III, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Regina Alberti and William Cadden \r\n  brought a declaratory action against Catawba Insurance Company to determine \r\n  if uninsured motorist coverage applied to an accidental shooting that took place \r\n  outside a car with a firearm found in the glove compartment of the car.Â  The \r\n  trial judge found the uninsured motorist coverage did not apply.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nWhile Alberti and her grandson \r\n  William (â€œAppellantsâ€) were visiting George Beard on April 15, 1997, William, \r\n  age five at the time, entered Beardâ€™s parked car and retrieved a gun from the \r\n  glove compartment. William was outside the car when the gun discharged, seriously \r\n  injuring his right hand. Alberti had an insurance policy with Catawba that provided \r\n  for uninsured motorist coverage. Appellants filed a declaratory judgment action \r\n  on August 9, 2000 to determine if the UM coverage applied to this accident.Â  \r\n  The parties stipulated that the amount of damages exceeded the liability coverage \r\n  on the vehicle, and therefore, if there was coverage, Catawba would pay the \r\n  policy limits of the UM coverage.Â  On March 14, 2002, the trial judge ruled \r\n  the UM coverage did not apply.Â  We affirm.Â Â  \r\n ISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err in finding that UM coverage \r\n  did not apply where the injury resulted from a gun that was retrieved from the \r\n  glove compartment of Albertiâ€™s car? \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œA suit for declaratory judgment \r\n  is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined by the nature of the underlying \r\n  issue.â€Â  Antley v. Nobel Ins. Co., 350 S.C. 621, 625, 567 S.E.2d 872, \r\n  874 (2002) (citing Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d \r\n  781, 782 (1991)).Â  â€œAn action to determine coverage under an insurance policy \r\n  is an action at law.â€Â  S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wilson, 344 \r\n  S.C. 525, 528-29, 544 S.E.2d 848, 849 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œIn an action at law, \r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s factual findings will not be disturbed on appeal unless a \r\n  review of the record reveals there is no evidence which reasonably supports \r\n  the judgeâ€™s findings.â€ Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants argue uninsured motorist coverage \r\n  should apply to cover Williamâ€™s injuries because Beardâ€™s car was used to store \r\n  a gun.Â  We disagree.\r\nA party making a claim under a car insurance \r\n  policy for personal injuries arising out of the â€œownership, maintenance, or \r\n  useâ€ of a car must meet three requirements: a causal chain between the car and \r\n  the injury, the absence of an act breaking the causal chain, and the use of \r\n  the car as transportation at the time of the injury. State Farm Mut. Auto. \r\n  Ins. Co. v. Bookert, 337 S.C. 291, 293, 523 S.E.2d 181, 182 (1999). There \r\n  is a causal chain if the car was an active accessory to the injury; if the car \r\n  was something less than proximate cause, but more than the mere site of the \r\n  injury; and if the injury is foreseeably identifiable with the normal use of \r\n  the car. Id.Â  \r\n No causal connection exists in this case \r\n  because the record fails to satisfy the three-part test. First, the car was \r\n  not an active accessory to the injury; it was merely a storage place for the \r\n  gun.Â  Second, the car was not the situs of the injury, as William was not injured \r\n  until he was outside the car.Â  Finally, the injury to William, inflicted from \r\n  a gun retrieved from the glove compartment, is not foreseeably identifiable \r\n  with the normal use of a car.Â  \r\nEven if a causal link existed between \r\n  the car and the injury, that link was broken by the self-inflicted nature of \r\n  the injury. William pulled the trigger after removing the gun from the car. \r\n  That act was one of independent significance which broke any potential causal \r\n  connection since the car itself was not used to injure William.Â  As the trial \r\n  judge explained in his order, â€œ[h]ad the vehicle hit a pothole, causing the \r\n  gun to discharge and injure the minor Plaintiff, the Court would be faced with \r\n  a claim of an entirely different nature.â€ Finally, the record clearly demonstrates \r\n  that the car was not being used for transportation since it was parked at the \r\n  time of the injury.Â  \r\nThe facts of this case are quite different from \r\n  cases meeting the three-part test, such as Wausau Underwriters Ins. Co. v. \r\n  Howser, 309 S.C. 269, 422 S.E.2d 106 (1992) and Home Ins. Co. v. Towe, \r\n  314 S.C. 105, 441 S.E.2d 825 (1994).Â  In Howser, the court held that \r\n  gunshot injuries sustained during a vehicular chase by an unknown assailant \r\n  in an unidentified car arose out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of an \r\n  uninsured automobile.Â  The court stated: \r\n\r\nOnly through use of his vehicle was the assailant able to \r\n  closely pursue Howser, thereby enabling him to carry out the pistol assault. \r\n  Â The gunshot was the culmination of an ongoing assault, in which the vehicle \r\n  played an essential and integral part.Â  Additionally, only a motor vehicle could \r\n  have provided the assailant a quick and successful escape.Â  Thus, we find a \r\n  sufficient causal connection exists between the use of the assailantâ€™s vehicle \r\n  and Howserâ€™s injuries. \r\n\r\nHowser, 309 S.C. at 273, 422 S.E.2d at 108. \r\n\r\nAs for Towe, the injuries occurred when \r\n  a bottle thrown from a car struck the victim.Â  The court found the use of the \r\n  car placed the assailant in the position to throw a bottle, and the carâ€™s speed \r\n  contributed to the seriousness of the injury.Â  Towe, 314 S.C. at 107, \r\n  441 S.E.2d at 827.Â  Therefore, the court held the car was an active accessory \r\n  and a causal connection existed between the use of the car and the injuries.Â  \r\n  Id. at 108, 441 S.E.2d at 827.\r\nThe present case more closely resembles State \r\n  Farm &amp; Cas. Co. v. Aytes, 332 S.C. 30, 503 S.E.2d 744 (1998).Â  There, \r\n  an assailant used a car to transport the victim to a certain location.Â  Having \r\n  reached that destination, the assailant went around to the passenger side of \r\n  the car, intending to harm the victim.Â  The victim retrieved a gun from the \r\n  glove compartment to defend herself, but the assailant gained control of the \r\n  gun. The assailant, while standing outside the car, fired the gun toward the \r\n  victim, who was sitting inside. The victim, an insured passenger, sought UM \r\n  benefits for the gunshot injuries.Â  Id. at 33, 503 S.E.2d at 746.Â  Although \r\n  the car was the situs of the injuries, the court found no UM coverage applied \r\n  because the car was neither an active accessory nor a means of transportation \r\n  at the time of the injury.Â  In addition, the court stated if there was a causal \r\n  link, it was broken when the assailant exited the car.Â  Id. at 35, 503 \r\n  S.E.2d at 746.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the above, the decision of the trial court \r\n  is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., ANDERSON and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-130","title":"State v.

Henderson and Joshua M. Henderson, both of Spartanburg, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nKenneth C. Anthony, Jr., of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this â€œbusiness divorce,â€ \r\n  William D. Brown appeals the special refereeâ€™s valuation of his ownership interest \r\n  in Personnel Solutions, Inc.Â  (PSI).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nBrown and Brenda Phillips met while both \r\n  were working for Personnel, Inc., a temporary services provider.Â  In \r\n  1991, they decided to leave Personnel, Inc., and form PSI, their own competing \r\n  company.Â  Because of the possibility of legal action by their former \r\n  employer to enforce the non-compete agreements each had signed, PSI was established \r\n  showing Phillips as the sole shareholder of the corporation. [1] Â  Both parties, however, agreed orally \r\n  that in reality each held a one-half interest in the business.Â  \r\nAfter a few years in business, \r\n  the parties formed Express Temps (ET), which was set up solely in Brownâ€™s name.Â  \r\n  ET was established as a separate company that was to act solely as a â€œpass \r\n  throughâ€ corporation.Â  The desired result was that permanent employees of PSI \r\n  would be allowed greater benefits and PSIâ€™s many temporary employees would now \r\n  be officially employed by ET, which would have much lower workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  premiums because, as a new company, it had no history of workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  claims.Â  At this point, PSI, although still in fact the temporary services \r\n  provider, was on paper merely a management firm with ET as its sole client. \r\n  [2] \r\nIn October 1995, the company accountant \r\n  alerted Phillips that Brown had been embezzling money from PSI for some time.Â  \r\n  After confronting Brown, Phillips agreed that, if Brown completed a treatment \r\n  program for his gambling and other addictions, he could return to PSI although \r\n  he would have no control over the company finances.Â  The parties further \r\n  agreed that Phillips would be allowed certain payments over time from the company \r\n  to her own personal accounts until the disparity between their compensations \r\n  was eliminated.\r\nAfter completing the treatment \r\n  program, Brown attempted to return to work at PSI.Â  According to Phillips, \r\n  however, because she had learned that the extent of Brownâ€™s embezzlement was \r\n  much greater than she initially believed, she did not allow him to return to \r\n  the business.Â  Phillips then established a new corporation, Preferred \r\n  Personnel, Inc., to essentially take the place of ET.\r\nBrown attempted for a brief time to form his own \r\n  business under ETâ€™s name; however, Phillips subsequently filed this action and \r\n  secured a temporary order enjoining all parties to the action from operating \r\n  under that name.Â  Brown then opened Staffing Associates, a new temporary \r\n  employment service, and in the process hired approximately one-half of PSIâ€™s \r\n  employees and took a portion of the customer base of PSI.&nbsp; \r\nDuring the course of the litigation, the \r\n  parties stipulated the issues to be decided at trial were (1) the value of PSI \r\n  and the appropriate date on which the corporation was to be valued, [3]  and (2) the amount, if any, due from Brown \r\n  as a result of his embezzlement from PSI.\r\nBy order entered March 27, 2002, the special referee \r\n  determined the value of Brownâ€™s interest in PSI to be $16,920 as of December \r\n  31, 1995. [4] Â  The special referee also determined \r\n  that neither party was entitled to damages from the other, having found the \r\n  amounts Brown embezzled were offset by several large payments made to Phillips \r\n  from company funds.Â  Brown appeals only the special refereeâ€™s evaluation \r\n  of his interest, contending error in the weight given to certain expert testimony \r\n  and the application of certain discounts in stock value.&nbsp;  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Brown first contends the special referee placed \r\n  too much weight on the fact that he and Phillips were not bound by a non-compete \r\n  agreement.Â  We disagree with this argument.\r\nThe presence or absence of a covenant not to compete \r\n  is a valid factor in determining the worth of a service-oriented corporate entity. \r\n  [5] Â  Here, Brownâ€™s own witnesses acknowledged the detrimental effect of \r\n  the absence of a non-compete agreement on the attractiveness of PSI to any potential \r\n  buyers.Â  Moreover, Brownâ€™s own actions in this case best illustrate why \r\n  such a decrease in value was due and proper.Â  Once prohibited by injunction \r\n  from interfering with PSI from within, Brown quickly moved into direct competition \r\n  across the street from the company, taking a substantial number of PSI employees \r\n  and clients with him.Â  The value of a service-oriented business such as PSI \r\n  lies in its contacts.Â  The right of a departing owner to take contacts with \r\n  him and directly compete with his former business most certainly decreases the \r\n  value of the original corporate entity.\r\n2.Â  Brown argues the special referee erred in assigning \r\n  too much weight to the testimony of James Forest Joyner, III, Phillipsâ€™s expert \r\n  witness on the fair market value of PSI and in disregarding the testimony of \r\n  his own experts.Â  We find no error.Â  Joyner was an experienced certified public \r\n  accountant, certified financial planner, and certified valuation analyst.Â  \r\n  He testified at length to the three generally accepted approaches to determining \r\n  the value of a corporate entity, thoroughly explaining his reasoning and methods \r\n  in determining the value of Brownâ€™s interest in PSI.Â  Joyner presented \r\n  his opinion on the corporationâ€™s net asset value, income value, and market value, \r\n  noting the proper weight to assign each varied with the type of business.Â  \r\n  In contrast, althoughÂ  each of Brownâ€™s experts had varying degrees of experience \r\n  in the field of temporary service providers, one admitted he did not consider \r\n  himself â€œexactly an expertâ€ and the other was unfamiliar with the valuation \r\n  approaches that Joyner discussed.Â  We therefore hold the special referee \r\n  committed no abuse of discretion in weighing the testimony of the various experts. \r\n  [6] \r\n3.Â  Brown next contends the special referee erred \r\n  in applying lack of control and marketability discounts in establishing a fair \r\n  value for his interest in PSI.Â  In support of his argument, he cites the case \r\n  of Morrow v. Martschink [7] \r\n   for the proposition that there are policy reasons against applying minority \r\n  and marketability discounts to the present situation.Â  We recognize the \r\n  inequities in applying these discounts to judicial dissolutions; however, we \r\n  hold it was proper to apply them to the present situation. \r\nFirst, although the special referee referenced \r\n  South Carolina Code section 33-14-310(d)(4), \r\n  [8]  this is not a true minority shareholderâ€™s or dissenterâ€™s rights case.Â  \r\n  Here, as it was undisputed that the parties were equal shareholders in PSI and \r\n  had agreed that Phillips would purchase Brownâ€™s interest in PSI, the issue before \r\n  the special referee was solely the value of that interest.Â  \r\nSecond, although Morrow extends the same \r\n  protection against the application of unfair discounts to a situation that, \r\n  like this one, falls outside the traditional minority dissenter paradigm, it \r\n  does so on the basis that many of the same policy concerns apply to close intra-family \r\n  transactions, â€œwhere a minority interest has been improperly squeezed out of \r\n  the business.â€ [9] Â  Such factors simply are not \r\n  present here.Â  We therefore hold the special referee properly applied lack of \r\n  control and marketability discounts in valuing Brownâ€™s interest in PSI. [10]   \r\n4.Â  Brown further argues the special referee erred \r\n  in assigning no weight to market value because he considered only the value \r\n  of PSI as a stand-alone management services company rather than as a temporary \r\n  services company.Â  Brown further alleges error in the special refereeâ€™s calculation \r\n  of income value, arguing that Joynerâ€™s analysis, on which the special referee \r\n  based his calculation, relied on incorrect adjustments to net income and failed \r\n  to account for bonuses, excessive expenses, and other nonfunctional distributions \r\n  paid to PSIâ€™s shareholders.Â  These issues are not preserved for appellate \r\n  review.Â  We did not see any ruling in the appealed order specifically addressing \r\n  these concerns and Brown did not raise them in a post-trial motion. \r\n  [11] \r\n5.Â  We reject Brownâ€™s argument that the special \r\n  referee erred in assigning too much weight to net asset value. [12] Â  Although Brownâ€™s experts \r\n  testified that physical assets were generally never used to determine the value \r\n  of a temporary services company, Joyner stated the income approach, even for \r\n  a business that had enjoyed substantial income, was unreliable if, as was the \r\n  case here, a principal of the company could leave at any time and take a substantial \r\n  portion of the customer base. [13] \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n GOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., and CURETON, \r\n  A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  The parties believed Phillips, a single mother, would be a more \r\n    sympathetic defendant in the event of a lawsuit.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Based on this arrangement, both \r\n    parties were later indicted for insurance fraud and spent some time in prison.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Â  The parties agreed Brownâ€™s interest was fifty per cent of this amount \r\n    and Phillips would pay him for his shares. \r\n\r\n \r\n    [4] Â  The special referee \r\n    found December 31, 1995, was the critical date because 1995 was the last year \r\n    Brown was actively involved with PSI.Â  Neither party appeals this finding.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5] Â  See McDuffie v. Oâ€™Neal, 324 S.C. 297, 305-06, 476 \r\n    S.E.2d 702, 706 (Ct.
