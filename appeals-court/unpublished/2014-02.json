Deveaux appeals his conviction for criminal sexual\r\nconduct with a minor in the first degree. Deveaux contends the circuit court erred\r\nin: (1) admitting the expert testimony of a forensic interviewer, (2) declining to\r\ndeclare a mistrial regarding the forensic interviewer's and the investigating officer's\r\n\ntestimony, (3) allowing the State to refer to section 16-3-657 of the South Carolina\r\nCode (2003) and charging this statute to the jury, and (4) declining to declare a\r\nmistrial regarding an alleged Brady1 violation. We reverse and remand for a new\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\n1.      We find the circuit court erred in admitting the challenged expert testimony\r\nof the forensic interviewer. \"The rules of evidence do not allow witnesses to vouch\r\nfor or offer opinions on the credibility of others, and the work of a forensic\r\ninterviewer, by its very nature, seeks to ascertain whether abuse occurred at all,\r\ni.e., whether the victim is telling the truth, and to identify the source of the abuse.\"\r\nState v. Kromah, 401 S.C. 340, 357 n.5, 737 S.E.2d 490, 499 n.5 (2013).\r\n\"[A]lthough an expert's testimony theoretically is to be given no more weight by a\r\njury than any other witness, it is an inescapable fact that jurors can have a tendency\r\nto attach more significance to the testimony of experts.\" Id. at 357, 737 S.E.2d at\r\n499. \"Further, even though experts are permitted to give an opinion, they may not\r\noffer an opinion regarding the credibility of others. It is undeniable that the\r\nprimary purpose for calling a 'forensic interviewer' as a witness is to lend\r\ncredibility to the victim's allegations. When this witness is qualified as an expert\r\nthe impermissible harm is compounded.\" Id. at 358, 737 S.E.2d at 499. A forensic\r\ninterviewer should avoid making any statement at trial that indirectly vouches for\r\nthe child's believability, any statement to indicate to a jury that the interviewer\r\nbelieves the child's allegations in the current matter, or an opinion that the child's\r\nbehavior indicated the child was telling the truth. Id. at 360, 737 S.E.2d at 500. At\r\nDeveaux's trial, Daniel Olszewski was qualified as an expert witness in forensic\r\ninterviewing and testified regarding his interviews with the victim. Olszewski\r\ntestified the victim's statements contained details indicating she had not been\r\ncoached; he then described those details and gave his opinion that the victim was\r\n\"better than young children\" at providing details of abuse. The victim's testimony\r\nwas the only evidence of abuse presented at trial. The State put forth no physical\r\nevidence of abuse, nor did any other witnesses testify to having observed the\r\nabuse. In light of the lack of other evidence presented by the State, the credibility\r\nof the victim was critical to the jury's determination of Deveaux's innocence or\r\nguilt. Therefore, we cannot say the improper admission of Olszewski's testimony\r\nas an expert witness in forensic interviewing was harmless. See id. at 360, 737\r\nS.E.2d at 501 (\"An appellate court generally will decline to set aside a conviction\r\ndue to insubstantial errors not affecting the result.\"); State v. Key, 256 S.C. 90, 93,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1   Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).\r\n\n180 S.E.2d 888, 890 (1971) (holding error is harmless when it \"could not\r\nreasonably have affected the result of the trial\"); State v. Watts, 321 S.C. 158, 165,\r\n467 S.E.2d 272, 277 (Ct. App. 1996) (\"In applying the harmless error rule, the\r\ncourt must be able to declare the error had little, if any, likelihood of having\r\nchanged the result of the trial and the court must be able to declare such belief\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\") (citing Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18 (1967));\r\nState v. Ellis, 345 S.C. 175, 178, 547 S.E.2d 490, 491 (2001) (finding error was not\r\nharmless when witness who was erroneously qualified as an expert provided\r\nimproper opinion which went to the heart of the matter); State v. Jennings, 394\r\nS.C. 473, 480, 716 S.E.2d 91, 94-95 (2011) (finding circuit court's admission of\r\nforensic interviewer's reports that vouched for the victims' credibility was not\r\nharmless when no physical evidence was presented at trial and the victims'\r\ncredibility was the most critical determination of the case).\r\n\r\n2.     Given our decision to reverse and remand for a new trial based on the circuit\r\ncourt's improper admission of Olszewski's expert testimony, we need not reach the\r\nremaining issues. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C.\r\n598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (finding an appellate court need not address\r\nremaining issues on appeal when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-043","title":"State v.

(Father) appeals the family court's order of removal,\r\narguing the family court erred in (1) concluding a preponderance of the evidence\r\nsupported a finding that Father sexually abused his daughter (Child) and (2)\r\nrefusing to admit a psychological study of Child performed by the Colorado\r\nDepartment of Social Services (DSS). We affirm.\r\n\r\n1. We find the family court did not err in concluding Father sexually abused Child.\r\nThe family court may order a child be removed from the custody of a parent if the\r\ncourt finds the allegations of the petition are supported by a preponderance of the\r\nevidence and determines the child is abused or neglected as defined in section 63-\r\n7-20 of the South Carolina Code (2010), returning the child to the home would\r\nplace her at unreasonable risk of harm, and removal is the only reasonable way to\r\nprotect the child from this harm. S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-1660(E) (2010). A child\r\nis abused or neglected if the parent commits a sexual offense against the child.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-20(4)(b) (2010). Although Father presented conflicting\r\ntestimony to show he did not sexually abuse Child, the family court relied heavily\r\non Child's testimony to find Father sexually abused her. See Lewis v. Lewis, 392\r\nS.C. 381, 385-86, 709 S.E.2d 650, 651-52 (2011) (holding although this court\r\nreviews factual and legal issues de novo on appeal from the family court, this court\r\nshould not ignore the fact that the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses,\r\nwas in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight\r\nto their testimony). Additionally, the South Carolina DSS caseworker and a family\r\nclinical therapist asserted Child disclosed Father sexually abused her. Thus, Father\r\nfailed to show the family court erred in its findings. See id. at 388, 709 S.E.2d at\r\n653 (providing the burden is upon the appellant to show the family court erred in\r\nits findings).\r\n\r\n2. We find the family court did not err in refusing to admit a psychological study of\r\nChild performed by the Colorado DSS. See High v. High, 389 S.C. 226, 238, 697\r\nS.E.2d 690, 696 (Ct. App. 2010) (\"[A] family court's ruling on the admission or\r\nexclusion of evidence will only be reversed if it constitutes an abuse of discretion\r\namounting to an error of law.\").\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.1\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and PIEPER and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1   We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-055","title":"Washington v.

After Jamesetta had been in labor for\r\ntwenty-four hours, the baby's heart rate showed periods of deceleration, which\r\ncaused Dr. Rhett concern over whether the baby was getting enough oxygen. Dr.\r\nRhett decided to deliver the baby with the help of a vacuum extractor, and the baby\r\nwas born three minutes and seven seconds later with the umbilical cord wrapped\r\naround his neck. An arterial blood gas sample indicated the baby was nearly\r\nacidotic and had higher-than-normal carbon dioxide levels and low oxygen levels.\r\nAs the baby's condition continued to deteriorate, medical staff transferred him to\r\nthe Medical University of South Carolina, where doctors diagnosed him with an\r\nintracranial hemorrhage, and operated on him.\r\n\r\nToday, the eleven-year-old child suffers from brain damage, including severe\r\ndevelopmental delays. He struggles with coordination, articulation and speech,\r\nreading and writing, and memory. Jamesetta presented expert testimony from a\r\npediatric neurologist that the child is unlikely to live independently due to his\r\ndisabilities.\r\n\r\nJamesetta brought this medical negligence action as the child's Guardian ad Litem\r\nagainst several defendants, each of whom settled except Dr. Rhett. Each of her\r\ntheories of recovery against Dr. Rhett is based on his alleged negligence regarding\r\nthe use of the vacuum extractor. After a thirteen-day trial, the jury returned a\r\nverdict responding \"No\" to the following question on the verdict form: \"Did the\r\nPlaintiff prove by the greater weight or preponderance of the evidence that the\r\nDefendant Dr. Rhett deviated from the standard of care?\"\r\n\r\nTo recover in any action for negligence, a plaintiff must prove the following four\r\nelements: (1) the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care; (2) the defendant\r\nbreached that duty by a negligent act or omission; (3) the plaintiff suffered\r\n\ndamages as a result; and (4) the damages were proximately caused by the breach of\r\nduty. Grier v. AMISUB of S.C., Inc., 397 S.C. 532, 537, 725 S.E.2d 693, 696\r\n(2012). Because the jury determined Dr. Rhett did not breach his duty of due care,\r\nand thus, did not reach subsequent questions related to causation, this court need\r\nnot address any issue raised by Jamesetta that relates to causation. See Stephens ex\r\nrel. Lillian C. v. CSX Transp., Inc., 400 S.C. 503, 520, 735 S.E.2d 505, 514 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2012) (\"Because the jury's verdict [that neither defendant breached its duty of\r\nreasonable care] made it unnecessary for the jury to reach the other issues in the\r\ncase, it is not necessary that we address any ruling . . . unless it relates to breach of\r\n[the defendants'] duty of reasonable care.\"). On this basis, we decline to address\r\nissues related to the admissibility of testimony showing that maternal use of\r\nalcohol or genetics may have caused the child's problems because we find these\r\nissues relate exclusively to the causation element.\r\n\r\nAs to the trial court's alleged error in refusing to charge the jury on informed\r\nconsent, we find Jamesetta's requested charge contained statements that were\r\ninapplicable to the facts of this case, and incorrect statements of the law.\r\nSpecifically, (1) the statement, \"a physician must respect a competent patient's\r\nrefusal of treatment, even in an emergency,\" is inapplicable because there is no\r\nevidence Jamesetta refused any treatment; (2) the statement, \"If a competent\r\npatient refuses treatment, any medical treatment is a battery, even in an\r\nemergency,\" is legally incorrect, see Linog v. Yampolsky, 376 S.C. 182, 187, 656\r\nS.E.2d 355, 358 (2008) (\"[N]o independent cause of action for medical battery\r\nexists in South Carolina.\"); and (3) the statement, \"if the patient is incapable of\r\nproviding consent, the consent of a family member [should be sought], before\r\nadministering treatment\" is legally inaccurate, see Harvey v. Strickland, 350 S.C.\r\n303, 311, 566 S.E.2d 529, 534 (2002) (rejecting doctor's argument he was under a\r\nduty to obtain patient's mother's consent for blood transfusion when patient was\r\nunconscious), as well as inapplicable to the facts of this case because there is no\r\nevidence Jamesetta was incapable of providing consent. As to all other statements\r\nin the requested jury charge, we find the trial court's charge correctly and\r\nadequately covered those points of law. See Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 311,\r\n536 S.E.2d 408, 425 (Ct. App. 2000) (\"When reviewing a jury charge for alleged\r\nerror, an appellate court must consider the charge as a whole in light of the\r\nevidence and issues presented at trial.\"); Dalon v. Golden Lanes, Inc., 320 S.C.\r\n534, 540, 466 S.E.2d 368, 372 (Ct. App. 1996) (\"It is the trial court's function to\r\ncharge the jury on the applicable law as raised by the pleadings and supported by\r\nthe evidence.\").\r\n\nAs to the jury charge Jamesetta requested on expert compensation, we find the trial\r\ncourt properly refused to give the charge because a jury may consider any evidence\r\nthe jury determines to relate to the credibility of any witness. See generally State\r\nv. McKerley, 397 S.C. 461, 464, 725 S.E.2d 139, 141 (Ct. App. 2012) (\"The\r\nassessment of witness credibility is within the exclusive province of the jury.\").\r\nThe requested charge states:\r\n\r\n             You should not take into consideration the fact that the\r\n             witness is paid unless there is some evidence or\r\n             circumstances appearing from the evidence which would\r\n             fully and reasonably convince you that the testimony of\r\n             the witness has been influenced because of the sum\r\n             which he has been paid as a witness.\r\n\r\nThe charge comes from Ralph King Anderson, South Carolina Requests to\r\nCharge–Civil § 1-6 (2d ed. 2009), which cites Anderson v. Campbell Tile Co., 202\r\nS.C. 54, 24 S.E.2d 104 (1943), in support. However, Anderson is distinguishable\r\nfrom this case for multiple reasons, including: (1) it is a workers' compensation\r\ncase; (2) it does not relate to the admissibility of evidence; and (3) it does not\r\ncontain the language Jamesetta requested, or even similar language. Additionally,\r\nAnderson mentions the payment of experts' fees only once—specifically, when\r\nlisting it as one of seven factors the Industrial Commission properly considered in\r\nweighing expert testimony. Anderson, 202 S.C. at 64, 24 S.E.2d at 108 (quoting\r\n20 Am. Jur. ¶1206).\r\n\r\nAs to Jamesetta's argument that the trial court erred in refusing to allow certain\r\nquestioning of her expert regarding a study during her reply case, we find the court\r\nacted within its discretion to limit the testimony for three reasons. First, Jamesetta\r\nwas the party who introduced the study. Second, and similarly, she was attempting\r\nto undercut the study that she introduced. Third, she had ample opportunity to\r\nquestion Dr. Gary Oakes, Dr. Rhett, and Dr. Lynn Norton concerning the\r\nparameters of the study or any other relevant material. These three facts support\r\nour conclusion that the trial court acted within its discretion in limiting reply\r\ntestimony. See Risher v. S.C. Dep't of Health & Envtl. Control, 393 S.C. 198, 206,\r\n712 S.E.2d 428, 432 (2011) (stating the admission or exclusion of expert testimony\r\nis a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court); Vernon v. Provident Life\r\n& Accident Ins. Co., 266 S.C. 208, 222, 222 S.E.2d 501, 508 (1976) (applying an\r\nabuse of discretion standard to a question of admission of reply testimony).\r\n\nAs to Jamesetta's argument that the trial court erred in admitting demonstrative\r\nevidence, we find the issue unpreserved for appellate review. See Gause v.\r\nSmithers, 403 S.C. 140, 151, 742 S.E.2d 644, 650 (2013) (stating 'an issue cannot\r\nbe raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon\r\nby the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review' (quoting Elam v. S.C. Dep't\r\nof Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 23, 602 S.E.2d 772, 780 (2004))). Jamesetta argues the trial\r\ncourt erroneously allowed Dr. Rhett to use a pelvic model and a vacuum pump as\r\ndemonstrative evidence. Her primary argument on appeal is that the trial court\r\nallowed the use of these items in contravention of a pretrial case management\r\norder. Her secondary argument is that the model was not to scale, and the pump\r\nwas used in a misleading demonstration. Both arguments are unpreserved for a\r\nnumber of reasons. First, the only objection Jamesetta made at the time Dr. Rhett\r\nintroduced the pelvic model was to \"the use of a measuring instrument to measure\r\na dimension that has absolutely no relevance.\" We read this as an objection to the\r\nintroduction of the measurement, not the use of the model. She made no objection\r\nto the vacuum pump. Because she made no objection to either item being used as\r\ndemonstrative evidence, nothing has been preserved for this court's review. See id.\r\nSecond, at trial, Jamesetta asserted her primary argument—the demonstrative\r\nevidence was used in violation of the case management order—only in connection\r\nto the use of an animation. While she mentioned the model in her argument about\r\nthe animation, she never raised the case management order as a basis for\r\ndisallowing the use of the pump or the model. Thus, the issue was not properly\r\npreserved. Third, Jamesetta's secondary arguments regarding the misleading pump\r\ndemonstration and the model being out of scale were never presented to the trial\r\ncourt. As a result, this issue is not preserved. See id.\r\n\r\nFinally, we find Jamesetta's argument the trial court erred in conducting voir dire is\r\nalso unpreserved for appellate review. Twice, the trial court asked Jamesetta if she\r\nhad any objection to the voir dire process; both times she responded, \"No, Your\r\nHonor.\" By declining the court's invitation to object, Jamesetta failed to preserve\r\nthe issue for appellate review. See id.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons stated above, the judgment of the trial court is AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., KONDUROS, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-056","title":"In the Matter of the Care and Treatment of Patrick Guess","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions//unpublishedopinions/HTMLFiles/COA/2014-UP-056.pdf","description":null,"date":"2014-02-05","type":"opinion","text":"THIS OPINION HAS NO PRECEDENTIAL VALUE.

We affirm\r\npursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities:1\r\n\r\n1. As to the sufficiency of the Commission's findings and conclusions: S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 42-9-301 (1985) (stating that as to any abuse of discretion in the\r\ncommission's finding that a lump sum payment should be made, the burden of\r\nproof shall be on the employer or carrier in any appeal proceedings); id. (merely\r\ngiving the Commission the authority to affirmatively order a lump sum payment\r\nwhen such a payment will prevent undue hardship on the employer or carrier:\r\n\"Whenever any weekly payment has been continued for not less than six weeks,\r\nthe liability therefor may, when the employee so requests and the commission\r\ndeems it not to be contrary to the best interest of the employee or his dependents,\r\nor when it will prevent undue hardship on the employer or his insurance carrier,\r\nwithout prejudicing the interest of the employee or his dependents, be redeemed, in\r\nwhole or in part, by the payment by the employer of a lump sum . . . .\" (emphasis\r\nadded)); Thompson v. S.C. Steel Erectors, 369 S.C. 606, 612, 632 S.E.2d 874, 878\r\n(Ct.

(\"An abuse of discretion\r\noccurs if the [Appellate Panel's] findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence\r\nor the conclusions reached are controlled by an error of law.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Immediately prior to scheduled oral arguments, Employee's counsel advised this\r\ncourt that the parties had entered into a settlement agreement relating to\r\nEmployee's workers' compensation claim. Counsel requested this court to continue\r\noral arguments \"to allow [him] the opportunity to file a Motion to Compel a\r\nSettlement Agreement[.]\" Counsel for Appellants denied the existence of a\r\nbinding settlement agreement between the parties. This court denied the request to\r\ncontinue oral arguments; however, we subsequently remanded this case to the\r\nCommission for a determination of whether there exists a binding agreement\r\nbetween the parties to settle Employee's claim.\r\n\r\n      Due to continued delays by the Commission, we ultimately revoked the\r\norder remanding the case so that it may proceed without further delay. To the\r\nextent any party still seeks to hold this appeal in abeyance, we deny the motion.\r\nShould any party desire to be heard on the question of the existence of a settlement\r\nagreement, such party will have an opportunity to file the appropriate motion with\r\nthe Commission after the remittitur is sent to the Commission.\r\n\n2.

Payne, both of Grier, Cox, &\r\nCranshaw, LLC, both of Columbia, for Respondent\r\nGunter Heating & Air.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: The circuit court granted summary judgment against all plaintiffs\r\nin favor of defendants All Pro Heating, A/C & Refrigeration and Gunter Heating &\r\nAir. We affirm.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court excluded the affidavit of the plaintiffs' expert, Derek Hodgin,\r\nafter determining it was a sham affidavit. See Cothran v. Brown, 357 S.C. 210,\r\n218, 592 S.E.2d 629, 633 (2004) (explaining the difference \"between a sham\r\naffidavit and a correcting or clarifying affidavit\"). The court ruled that without\r\nHodgin's affidavit, the plaintiffs presented no issue of material fact, and thus All\r\nPro and Gunter were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Rule 56, SCRCP.\r\nHowever, the circuit court also ruled that even considering the affidavit, the\r\nplaintiffs' evidence \"does not create an issue of fact to withstand summary\r\njudgment.\" We do not address whether Hodgin's affidavit was a sham because we\r\nagree with the circuit court that, even considering the affidavit, the plaintiffs\r\nsubmitted only speculation, and no evidence, as to who cut the truss. Therefore,\r\nthere is no issue of material fact, and All Pro and Gunter were entitled to judgment\r\nas a matter of law. See Pres. Capital Consultants, LLC v. First Am. Title Ins. Co.,\r\n406 S.C. 309, 315, 751 S.E.2d 256, 259 (2013) (\"Summary judgment is proper if,\r\nviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, there is no\r\ngenuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a\r\nmatter of law.\").\r\n\r\nFor the reasons stated above, the circuit court's granting of summary judgment is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and PIEPER and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-063","title":"State v.

We affirm pursuant\r\nto Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities:\r\n\r\n1.     As to the witness's comment on Matthews' post-arrest exercise of his right to\r\nsilence, we find the trial court did not err in denying Matthews' motion for a\r\nmistrial and correctly cured any possible prejudice by issuing a curative instruction\r\nto the jury. See State v. Smith, 290 S.C. 393, 395, 350 S.E.2d 923, 924 (1986)\r\n(\"The jury should be specifically instructed to disregard the evidence, and not to\r\nconsider it for any purpose during deliberations.\"); State v. White, 371 S.C. 439,\r\n445, 639 S.E.2d 160, 163 (Ct. App. 2006) (\"If the trial [court] sustains a timely\r\nobjection to evidence and gives the jury a curative instruction that it be\r\ndisregarded, the error is deemed to have been cured by the instruction.\"); State v.\r\nWalker, 366 S.C. 643, 658, 623 S.E.2d 122, 129 (Ct. App. 2005) (\"Generally, a\r\ncurative instruction is deemed to have cured any alleged error.\").\r\n\r\n2.     As to the request for a continuance, we find the trial court did not err in\r\ndenying Matthews' motion when he admitted he had not even requested a copy of\r\nthe transcript from the first trial prior to the second trial, and Matthews was able to\r\nuse his notes from the first trial to question the officers about their inconsistent\r\ntestimony. See State v. Asbury, 328 S.C. 187, 195, 493 S.E.2d 349, 353 (1997)\r\n(finding the trial court correctly denied Asbury's motion for a continuance, ruling\r\nthe transcript would have been beneficial, but was not essential when Asbury had\r\nnot established any prejudice from the lack of access to the transcript from his first\r\ntrial because the court reporter's backup tapes from the first trial were available and\r\nhe could have requested use of these tapes, if necessary, to impeach a witness\r\nduring trial); State v. Owenby, 267 S.C. 666, 668, 230 S.E.2d 898, 898 (1976) (\"[I]t\r\nis preferable to have available the written transcript taken at the former [trial], but\r\nthe unavailability of such transcript does not preclude the utilization of other\r\nmeans of proving to the court what the witness stated on a prior occasion.\"); State\r\nv. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 77, 538 S.E.2d 257, 262-63 (Ct. App. 2000)\r\n(determining the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mansfield's\r\n\nmotion for a continuance to obtain the trial transcript when he could have served\r\nthe court reporter with a subpoena to appear in court and a subpoena duces tecum\r\nto bring the tapes with her); cf. State v. McMillan, 349 S.C. 17, 24, 561 S.E.2d 602,\r\n605 (2002) (holding the trial court erred in denying a request for a continuance\r\nwhen the defendant's basis for the continuance was to obtain the transcripts from\r\nthe first trial to use as impeachment for the retrial; however, McMillan requested\r\nthe transcripts from the first trial prior to the second trial, he had not received the\r\ntranscripts when the case was called for retrial, and no court-reporter back-up tapes\r\nwere available).\r\n\r\n3.     As to the in-court identification of Matthews by the owner of the burglarized\r\nhome, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion and properly denied\r\nMatthews' motion to suppress the in-court identification because Matthews' due\r\nprocess rights were not violated by the admission of the identification testimony\r\nwhen (1) the owner was fully cross-examined regarding his identification and the\r\nsuggestiveness of the media identification; (2) the owner looked at the online\r\nbooking photographs for his own interest, and the record does not indicate he\r\nreported viewing the photograph to law enforcement or that it was used as an out-\r\nof-court identification; (3) the owner observed Matthews' booking photograph\r\nwithin one week of the robbery; (4) the owner testified he had ample time to\r\nobserve the robber; (5) the owner testified he was one-hundred percent certain of\r\nhis identification; (6) Matthews was found in the truck that matched the description\r\nthe owner gave 911; and (7) Matthews was holding the items from the owner's\r\nhouse in his lap when the police stopped the truck. See State v. Tisdale, 338 S.C.\r\n607, 613-15, 527 S.E.2d 389, 393 (Ct. App. 2000) (determining Tisdale's due\r\nprocess rights were not violated by the admission of the identification testimony\r\nbecause: (1) the witnesses were fully cross-examined regarding their descriptions\r\nand the suggestiveness of the media identification; (2) the amount of time between\r\nthe robbery and the media identification was short; (3) the witnesses had ample\r\ntime to observe the robber; (4) the witnesses were certain of their identifications;\r\nand (5) other evidence was presented against the defendant).\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-065","title":"Brown v.

Yates argues the trial court erred in denying his motion\r\nto amend its order denying his Rule 60(b), SCRCP, motion. Specifically, he\r\nargues the trial court erred in (1) using the \"sound discretion of the reviewing\r\njudge\" standard to review his Rule 60(b) motion; (2) failing to find the trial court's\r\norder was void under Rule 60(b)(4) because his due process rights were violated\r\n\nwhen the trial court failed to rule in his favor after he presented substantial,\r\nuncontested evidence; and (3) failing to find the trial court's order was void under\r\nRule 60(b)(4) because his due process rights were violated when the trial court\r\nbased its ruling on erroneous suppositions. We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b),\r\nSCACR, and the following authorities:\r\n\r\n1. As to the standard of review: Rule 60(b)(4), SCRCP (providing \"[o]n motion\r\nand upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal\r\nrepresentative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding\"); BB & T v.

As to the due process issue concerning the substantial, uncontested evidence:\r\nRule 60(b)(4), SCRCP (\"On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may\r\nrelieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, or\r\nproceeding for the following reasons . . . the judgment is void.\"); Universal\r\nBenefits, Inc. v.

Specifically, Robinson contends\r\nthe trial court erroneously admitted his 2009 conviction for attempted robbery and\r\ntwo 2007 Georgia convictions for breaking into an automobile with intent to\r\ncommit a theft or felony. We remand.\r\n\r\nExamining the record, we conclude the trial court did not conduct a meaningful\r\nanalysis balancing the impeachment value of Robinson's prior convictions against\r\ntheir prejudicial effect. See State v. Scriven, 339 S.C. 333, 344, 529 S.E.2d 71, 76\r\n(Ct. App. 2000) (stating the trial court must conduct \"a meaningful analysis to\r\nbalance the impeachment value of [a defendant's] prior convictions, if any, against\r\nthe prejudicial impact, as clearly required under Rule 609(a)(1)[, SCRE]\").\r\nAlthough the trial court found Robinson's prior convictions were \"within the\r\nstatute\" and ordered the State to refer to his 2009 second-degree burglary\r\nconviction as a \"felony,\" the trial court did not analyze the prejudicial impact of\r\nadmitting his 2009 attempted robbery conviction and two 2007 Georgia\r\nconvictions for breaking into an automobile with intent to commit a theft or felony.\r\nSee id. (stating if the trial court does not conduct a meaningful on-the-record\r\nbalancing test, a decision to admit a defendant's prior convictions is an error of law\r\nresulting in an abuse of discretion).\r\n\r\nOn remand, the trial court should hold a hearing and carefully balance the\r\nprobative value of his prior convictions for impeachment purposes against their\r\nprejudicial effect. If the trial court finds the prejudicial impact of the prior\r\nconvictions outweighs their impeachment value, the trial court shall order a new\r\ntrial. Otherwise, subject to further appellate review, the convictions and sentences\r\nare affirmed. See State v. Howard, 384 S.C. 212, 222, 682 S.E.2d 42, 48 (Ct. App.\r\n2009) (remanding for an on-the-record balancing test weighing the probative value\r\nof the defendant's prior convictions against their prejudicial effect); Scriven, 339\r\nS.C. at 344, 529 S.E.2d at 77 (remanding to the trial court \"with instructions to\r\nhold a hearing on the admissibility of [the defendant's] prior convictions, applying\r\nthe proper burden of establishing admissibility, and carefully weighing the\r\nprobative value for impeachment of the prior convictions against the prejudice to\r\n[the defendant]\").\r\n\r\nREMANDED.1\r\n\r\n\r\n1   We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-069","title":"Carew v.

Fosmire, The Fosmire Law Firm, LLC, of\r\n        Columbia, for Appellants.\r\n\r\n        Thomas W. McGee, III and Michael J. Anzelmo, Nelson\r\n        Mullins Riley & Scarborough, LLP, both of Columbia,\r\n        for Respondent.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: Joseph and Karen Carew filed negligence and breach of contract\r\nclaims against RBC Bank, the lender that financed the construction of the Carews'\r\nhome. We affirm the circuit court's granting of summary judgment on both claims.\r\n\r\nThe Carews allege RBC acted negligently in monitoring the construction of their\r\nhome, which resulted in disbursal of loan proceeds in an amount greater than the\r\ncompletion percentage of the home, and construction defects. We find their\r\nnegligence claim fails as a matter of law because the Carews cannot establish RBC\r\nowed them a legal duty of care. See Hansson v. Scalise Builders of S.C., 374 S.C.\r\n352, 357, 650 S.E.2d 68, 71 (2007) (stating summary judgment is warranted when\r\nthe non-moving party \"fails to . . . establish the existence of an element essential to\r\nthe party's case\"); Madison ex rel. Bryant v. Babcock Ctr., Inc., 371 S.C. 123, 135,\r\n638 S.E.2d 650, 656 (2006) (providing that \"[i]n a negligence action, a plaintiff\r\nmust show . . . the defendant owes a duty of care to the plaintiff\"); Roundtree\r\nVillas Ass'n v. 4701 Kings Corp., 282 S.C. 415, 422, 321 S.E.2d 46, 50 (1984)\r\n(holding periodic inspections during construction are \"fundamentally for the\r\nprotection of the lending institution and do[] not impose upon the lending\r\ninstitution a duty to see that the builder is getting a job free of defects\"); Regions\r\nBank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 669-70, 582 S.E.2d 432, 443-44 (Ct. App. 2003)\r\n(holding a lender did not owe a borrower a duty of care \"in the regular course of its\r\nbusiness\").\r\n\r\nRegarding the Carews' assertion that RBC was negligent for \"paying for the same\r\nconstruction draws twice,\" RBC later reimbursed the Carews in full, and thus we\r\nfind the Carews' claim fails as a matter of law because they presented no evidence\r\nto prove they suffered any injury from this conduct. See Hansson, 374 S.C. at 357,\r\n650 S.E.2d at 71; Madison, 371 S.C. at 135, 638 S.E.2d at 656 (stating \"[i]n a\r\nnegligence action, a plaintiff must show . . . [he or she] suffered an injury or\r\ndamages\").\r\n\r\nTurning to the provisions of the contract, we initially find the record supports that\r\nthe agreement was not an adhesion contract, nor were its terms unconscionable.\r\nSee Simpson v. MSA of Myrtle Beach, Inc., 373 S.C. 14, 26-27, 644 S.E.2d 663,\r\n669 (2007) (defining an adhesion contract as \"a standard form contract offered on a\r\n'take-it-or- leave-it' basis with terms that are not negotiable\"); Carolina Care Plan,\r\nInc. v. United HealthCare Servs., Inc., 361 S.C. 544, 554, 606 S.E.2d 752, 757\r\n(2004) (defining unconscionability \"as the absence of meaningful choice on the\r\npart of one party due to one-sided contract provisions, together with terms that are\r\nso oppressive that no reasonable person would make them and no fair and honest\r\n\nperson would accept them\"). The loan agreement in this case is typical of those\r\nused by other lenders, and the Carews presented no evidence and cite no case law\r\nto prove the terms of the agreement were unconscionable. See Simpson, 373 S.C.\r\nat 27, 644 S.E.2d at 669 (stating an adhesion contract is not \"per se\r\nunconscionable\"). The Carews expressly agreed to pay for the services of the\r\nappraisal company, and we find it is a reasonable fee to incur in exchange for RBC\r\nextending the construction loan to them. Thus, we find the contract is enforceable.\r\n\r\nWe further find the record supports that the agreement created no obligation on\r\nRBC in regard to construction inspections. Specifically, we find sections 7.2.2 and\r\n8.4 of the agreement establish that (1) RBC had no obligation to conduct\r\ninspections, (2) all inspections were for RBC's sole benefit, and (3) the Carews had\r\nno right to rely on any such inspections. The Carews argue section 8.4 is\r\nunenforceable because it is \"inconspicuous boilerplate language\" that \"was not\r\nspecifically bargained for.\" We find this argument unpersuasive because (1)\r\nsection 8.4 is not, in fact, a waiver provision because the Carews had no existing\r\nright to rely on the inspections; (2) the Carews cite no applicable case law to\r\nsupport their argument; and (3) we do not to see how the Carews can argue the\r\nprovision was not known to them or non-negotiable when Joseph Carew admitted\r\nhe did not read the agreement. See Wachovia Bank v. Blackburn, 394 S.C. 579,\r\n585, 716 S.E.2d 454, 458 (Ct. App. 2011) (\"A person signing a document is\r\nresponsible for reading the document and making sure of its contents.\" (citation\r\nomitted)).\r\n\r\nIn regard to the Carews' breach of contract claim, we affirm the court's finding that\r\nsections 7.2.2 and 8.4 of the agreement placed no obligations on RBC, \"and,\r\ntherefore, cannot support a claim for breach of contract.\" We do not address the\r\ncourt's specific findings regarding other provisions of the agreement, as the Carews\r\ndo not assert on appeal that the trial court erred in making these findings. See\r\nCarolina Renewal, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 385 S.C. 550, 557, 684 S.E.2d\r\n779, 783 (Ct. App. 2009) (\"Because [the appellant] does not argue these issues on\r\nappeal, they are considered abandoned.\"). Although the Carews argue RBC is\r\nliable because \"its role was more than that of a mere lender,\" we find this argument\r\nunpreserved, as the Carews did not assert this argument to the trial court. See B &\r\nA Dev., Inc. v. Georgetown Cnty., 372 S.C. 261, 271, 641 S.E.2d 888, 894 (2007)\r\n(stating an issue not raised to and ruled upon by the trial court is unpreserved).\r\n\r\nFor the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the circuit court's granting of summary\r\njudgment as to the Carews' negligence and breach of contract claims.\r\n\nFEW, C.J., PIEPER and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-070","title":"State v.

(Father), a Georgia resident, appeals the South\r\nCarolina family court's order denying his motion to bifurcate and dismiss a\r\nremoval action involving his minor child based on lack of subject matter\r\njurisdiction. Father argues the South Carolina family court erred in finding it\r\nretained continuing and exclusive jurisdiction over this matter after the Georgia\r\nsuperior court asserted initial jurisdiction as the child's home state. Father also\r\nargues the family court erred in failing to give full faith and credit to the Georgia\r\nsuperior court's order awarding him custody of the child. We reverse and remand.1\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge the denial of a motion to dismiss is generally not immediately\r\nappealable. See Deskins v. Boltin, 319 S.C. 356, 357, 461 S.E.2d 395, 396 (1995)\r\n(\"[T]he denial of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is not\r\nimmediately appealable.\"). However, because this appeal stems from a South\r\nCarolina Department of Social Services (DSS) action involving the custody of a\r\nminor child and because a South Carolina family court and a Georgia superior\r\ncourt have ruled they have jurisdiction to issue a custody determination, we\r\nconsider this matter in the interest of justice and judicial economy. See Bowen &\r\nSmoot v. Plumlee, 301 S.C. 262, 265, 391 S.E.2d 558, 559 (1990) (noting the\r\ndenial of a motion to dismiss is not immediately appealable but reviewing the\r\ndenial because the court felt \"compelled to state that an attorney may not maintain\r\nan action for attorney's fees against his client's children on the theory that they\r\nbenefitted from a judgment awarding child support\"); Widdicombe v. Tucker-\r\nCales, 366 S.C. 75, 85, 620 S.E.2d 333, 338-39 (Ct. App. 2005) (\"[T]he issues\r\nraised by [the m]other on appeal have been the subject of much contention in this\r\ncase. They will inevitably be raised to the family court again in the future and,\r\nbecause they have been fully briefed by the parties, we find that it would be in the\r\ninterest of judicial economy to decide the matters now.\"), aff'd in part and vacated\r\nin part on other grounds, 375 S.C. 427, 428, 653 S.E.2d 276, 276 (2007).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1   We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\n\"The [Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA)]2 and the [Uniform Child\r\nCustody Jurisdiction Enforcement Act (UCCJEA)] govern subject matter\r\njurisdiction in interstate child custody disputes.\" Anthony H. v. Matthew G., 397\r\nS.C. 447, 451, 725 S.E.2d 132, 134 (Ct. App. 2012). \"The PKPA is primarily\r\nconcerned with when full faith and credit should be given to another [s]tate's\r\ncustody determination.\" Id. \"The UCCJEA's primary purpose is to provide\r\nuniformity of the law with respect to child custody decrees between courts in\r\ndifferent states.\" Id.\r\n\r\nSection 63-15-330 of the South Carolina Code (2010) grants South Carolina\r\nsubject matter jurisdiction to issue an initial child custody determination only if:\r\n(1) South Carolina is the child's home state on the date the action commences or\r\nwas the child's home state within six months before the action commences and a\r\n\"person acting as a parent continues to live in [South Carolina]\"; (2) a court of\r\nanother state does not have jurisdiction under item (1), or a court of the child's\r\nhome state declines jurisdiction; (3) all courts having jurisdiction under item (1) or\r\n(2) have declined jurisdiction; or (4) no court of any other state would have\r\njurisdiction under the criteria specified in items (1), (2), or (3). \"'Commencement'\r\nmeans the filing of the first pleading in a proceeding.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 63-15-\r\n302(5) (2010). \"'Home state' means the state in which a child lived with a parent\r\nor a person acting as a parent for at least six consecutive months immediately\r\nbefore the commencement of a child custody proceeding.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 63-\r\n15-302(7) (2010).\r\n\r\nWhen DSS commenced this removal action on September 26, 2012, South\r\nCarolina was not the child's home state because the child had not lived in South\r\nCarolina for six months. Conversely, Georgia was the child's home state within six\r\nmonths before this action commenced and Father still lived in Georgia. Thus,\r\nunder item (1), the Georgia superior court had jurisdiction to make the initial\r\ncustody determination. Because the Georgia superior court did not decline\r\njurisdiction, South Carolina did not have jurisdiction to issue an initial child\r\ncustody determination. See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-15-330 (2010); Ga. Code Ann. §\r\n19-9-61 (2001).\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina family court's only basis for jurisdiction under the UCCJEA\r\nwas emergency jurisdiction under section 63-15-336 of the South Carolina Code\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2   28 U.S.C. § 1738A (2006).\r\n\n(2010), and the South Carolina family court was limited to the jurisdiction\r\nconferred by the statute. A plain reading of the statute indicates South Carolina's\r\nremoval order would not become a final determination if an action was pending in\r\nGeorgia or was subsequently filed in Georgia. See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-15-336(B)\r\n(2010) (noting a South Carolina order may become final \"[i]f a child custody\r\nproceeding has not been or is not commenced in a court of a state having\r\njurisdiction\" (emphasis added)). Additionally, based on the language of section\r\n63-15-336(B), South Carolina's order could not become a final determination until\r\nSouth Carolina became the child's home state. When the South Carolina family\r\ncourt issued the December 3, 2012 removal order, South Carolina was not yet the\r\nchild's home state. Thus, under the UCCJEA, the removal order was not a final\r\ndetermination when it was issued.\r\n\r\nUnder section 63-15-336(B), the only way the South Carolina family court's order\r\ncould become a final determination would be \"[i]f a child custody proceeding has\r\nnot been or is not commenced in a court of a state having jurisdiction under\r\n[s]ections 63-15-330 through 63-15-334.\" Because a valid action commenced in\r\nGeorgia on December 20, 2012,3 when Georgia had jurisdiction to make an initial\r\n\r\n\r\n3 To the extent DSS asserts the Georgia action Father commenced on December\r\n20, 2012, was fatally defective because Father failed to join DSS or serve Mother,\r\nwe find Father commenced a valid action for custody in Georgia on December 20,\r\n2012. \"Commencement,\" as defined by the UCCJEA statutes in Georgia and\r\nSouth Carolina, does not include a requirement for service or joinder. See Ga.\r\nCode Ann. § 19-9-41(5) (2001) (defining \"commencement\" as \"the filing of the\r\nfirst pleading in a proceeding\"); S.C. Code Ann. § 63-15-302(5) (2010) (same).\r\nThe omission suggests service and joinder are not prerequisites when determining\r\nthe commencement date for jurisdictional disputes between states. Further,\r\nGeorgia law states, \"A civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the\r\ncourt.\" Ga. Code. Ann. § 9-11-3(a) (2006). In Georgia, \"once service is\r\naccomplished, it relates back to the date of filing, and the date of filing establishes\r\nthe date the action is commenced.\" Odion v. Varon, 718 S.E.2d 23, 26 (Ga. Ct.\r\nApp. 2011). Thus, under the UCCJEA and Georgia law, Father's action\r\ncommenced on December 20, 2012. Even if \"commencement\" required service\r\nand proper joinder, under Georgia law the date of filing for a properly amended\r\ncomplaint relates back to the date the original petition was filed. See Ga. Code\r\nAnn. § 9-11-15 (1972). Thus, even if Father's initial complaint was fatally\r\ndefective, Father's amended complaint cured any defects.\r\n\ncustody determination, the South Carolina family court erred in finding the South\r\nCarolina order became a final determination and South Carolina became the child's\r\nhome state. Further, because Georgia had jurisdiction to make an initial child\r\ncustody determination and Georgia did not decline such jurisdiction, the family\r\ncourt erred in denying Father's motion to bifurcate and dismiss the removal action\r\ninvolving Father's child. We reverse and remand with instructions for the family\r\ncourt to issue an order dismissing Father and Father's child from this action\r\nbecause the Georgia superior court has jurisdiction over this matter.4\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.5\r\n\r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 Without expressing any opinion about the validity of the Georgia superior court's\r\norder holding Anderson County DSS in civil contempt, we note the order states the\r\ncontempt may be purged by returning the child to Father.\r\n5 We need not address the issue of whether the family court erred in failing to give\r\nfull faith and credit to the Georgia superior court's order because our ruling on the\r\nfirst issue is dispositive.

McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335\r\nS.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (stating an appellate court need not\r\naddress an issue when a decision on another issue is dispositive).\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-074","title":"Wilkes v.

Connell, Jr., of Kelaher Connell & Connor, PC,\r\n            of Surfside Beach, for Appellant.\r\n\r\n            Walker H. Willcox, of Willcox Buyck & Williams, PA,\r\n            of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This negligence action arises from the filling in of a swimming\r\npool on a residential property purchased by Appellant Tim Wilkes at a judicial\r\n\nsale. Wilkes argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to\r\nRespondent Horry County (the County) on the ground that Wilkes was not the\r\nrecord owner of title for the residential property at the time notice was given to\r\nsecure the swimming pool. We affirm.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina law governing judicial sales establishes that equitable title is\r\ntransferred to the purchaser upon the payment of the purchase price. See Levi v.\r\nGardner, 53 S.C. 24, 30, 30 S.E. 617, 619 (1898) (\"There being no deed from the\r\nsheriff to Felder, the sale by the sheriff and the payment of the purchase money bid\r\nby Felder gave Felder, at most, only an equitable title.\"); see also Parrott v.\r\nDickson, 151 S.C. 114, 122, 148 S.E. 704, 707 (1929) (\"When the appellant\r\nbecame the successful bidder and paid in the required one-third of the purchase\r\nprice, he became the equitable owner of these lots.\"). In order for a judicial sale to\r\nbe completed and for legal title to the property to pass, a court officer must execute\r\na deed conveying title to the property. See S.C. Code Ann. § 15-39-830 (2005)\r\n(\"Upon a judicial sale being made and the terms complied with[,] the officer\r\nmaking the sale must execute a conveyance to the purchaser [that] shall be\r\neffectual to pass the rights and interests adjudged to be sold.\" (emphasis added)).\r\nTherefore, a judicial sale is still subject to attack where a court officer has not\r\nexecuted a deed conveying title to the property. See Goethe v. Cleland, 323 S.C.\r\n50, 54-55, 448 S.E.2d 574, 576 (Ct. App. 1994) (holding that a judicial sale was\r\nnever completed and the proceedings were still subject to attack where the\r\nappellant had yet to comply with the bid and, consequently, the clerk never issued\r\na deed to the appellant).\r\n\r\nEven assuming Wilkes had paid the full purchase price at the time notice was\r\ngiven, payment of the purchase price does not vest legal title in the purchaser; the\r\nissuance of the deed does. The facts show that at the time the County notified the\r\nprior owner of record to secure the swimming pool,1 the Master-in-Equity had yet\r\nto execute the deed conveying ownership in the property to Wilkes.2 Because\r\nWilkes was not the legal owner of the property at the time notice was given, the\r\nCounty was entitled to rely on the title records in serving notice to the prior owner\r\nof record and was under no obligation to notify Wilkes of the ordinance violation.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Notice of the ordinance violation was sent to the prior owner of record on August\n\r\n20, 2010.\n\r\n2 The Master-in-Equity executed the deed of conveyance to Wilkes on August 23, \n\r\n2010.\n\r\n\nAccordingly, we find the circuit court did not err in granting the County's motion\r\nfor summary judgment on this basis.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nHUFF, GEATHERS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-076","title":"Breakfield v.

We affirm\r\npursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities:\r\n\r\n1. As to whether the magistrate's court erred in proceeding with the ejectment\r\naction when Woods pled the defense of questionable title: Metro. Life Ins.

We affirm.\r\n\r\nMichael Mauldin, a former girls soccer coach at Irmo High School, sued seven\r\nparents—all of whom had daughters on his team—for interference with contractual\r\nrelations and defamation. These parents—who had concerns regarding Coach\r\nMauldin's conduct and control of the team—approached the school principal, the\r\nschool district and the Office of Civil Rights in succession, seeking a proper\r\ninvestigation and communication of the results of that investigation. The\r\nallegations against Coach Mauldin encompassed conduct bordering on sexual\r\nharassment, tolerance or encouragement of hazing, and an inappropriate blurring of\r\nthe line between his role as a coach/teacher and a friend. Ultimately, the district\r\noffered to place Coach Mauldin at a different high school, which he accepted.\r\nAfterwards, Coach Mauldin filed suit against the seven parents involved in his\r\ndeparture from Irmo High School. Five of the parents settled, and the remaining\r\ntwo parents agreed to dismiss the suit. Following the dismissal, the two parents\r\nsought sanctions, contending the suit was frivolous and never should have been\r\nfiled.\r\n\r\n\"The determination of whether attorney's fees should be awarded under Rule 11 or\r\nunder the [FPA] is treated as one in equity.\" Se. Site Prep, LLC v. Atl. Coast\r\nBuilders & Contractors, LLC, 394 S.C. 97, 104, 713 S.E.2d 650, 654 (Ct.

Parbel, 378\r\nS.C. 253, 265, 662 S.E.2d 466, 473 (Ct. App. 2008) (quoting Rutland, 371 S.C. 91,\r\n97, 637 S.E.2d 316, 319 (2006) (internal quotations omitted)). A trial court's\r\ndecision to award or deny sanctions will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of\r\ndiscretion. Culbertson v.

Wright, 322 S.C. 15, 19, 471 S.E.2d 160, 162,\r\n(1996). The FPA provides, \"[a]n attorney . . . participating in a civil . . . action . . .\r\n\nmay be sanctioned for: (a) filing a frivolous pleading . . . if: . . . (ii) a reasonable\r\nattorney in the same circumstances would believe that under the facts, his claim . . .\r\nwas clearly not warranted under existing law and that a good faith or reasonable\r\nargument did not exist for the extension, modification, or reversal or existing law.\"\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 15-36-10(A)(4)(a)(ii) (Supp. 2013) (emphasis added).1\r\n\r\nWe agree with the trial court's findings of fact and therefore review the trial court's\r\ndecision to deny sanctions under an abuse of discretion standard. While we are\r\nconcerned that Coach Mauldin's lawyer could have done more to investigate his\r\nclient's claims before filing suit, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's\r\ndecision not to award sanctions.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the trial court's ruling is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., HUFF and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Contrast the use of the word \"may\" in S.C.

Booth, III, of Booth Law Firm, LLC, of West\r\n            Columbia, and James B. Richardson, Jr., of Columbia,\r\n            for Appellant.\r\n\r\n            Andrew Carl English, III, Mary Dameron Milliken, and,\r\n            George Albert Taylor, all of Callison Tighe & Robinson,\r\n            LLC, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This appeal arises from the circuit court's determination that\r\nRespondent Peter Buyck, Jr. established a prescriptive easement on a road (\"the\r\n\nRed Road\") located on Appellant William Jackson's property. On appeal, Jackson\r\nargues the circuit court erred by: (1) refusing to presume the use of the Red Road\r\nwas permissive pursuant to the unenclosed woodlands rule; (2) finding Buyck\r\nestablished a prescriptive easement; (3) determining the easement was appurtenant,\r\nnot in gross; and (4) finding Buyck may authorize the use of the Red Road to\r\nanyone he choses. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1. Evidence in the record supports the circuit court's finding that Jackson's\r\nproperty is not unenclosed woodlands. Therefore, the circuit court did not err by\r\nrefusing to presume permissive use pursuant to the unenclosed woodlands rule.\r\nSee Crossmann Cmtys. of N.C., Inc. v. Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co., 395 S.C. 40, 46-\r\n47, 717 S.E.2d 589, 592 (2011) (\"In an action at law tried without a jury, the\r\nappellate court will not disturb the trial court's findings of fact unless there is no\r\nevidence to reasonably support them.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Hutto v.\r\nTindall, 40 S.C.L. (6 Rich.) 396, 400 (1853) (noting a distinction \"between the\r\nclaim of a way through enclosed and cultivated land, and of a way over unenclosed\r\nwoodland\"); id. at 401 (explaining the use of a way for twenty years through\r\nunenclosed and uncultivated woodlands is merely permissive, but when the road\r\nruns through enclosed and cultivated land, the use is implied to be adverse); Hogg\r\nv. Gill, 26 S.C.L. (1 McMul.) 329, 332 (Ct. App. 1841) (providing the purpose of\r\nthe unenclosed woodlands rule is to put the landowner on notice because \"[t]he\r\nowner of the land might not know of the existence of the way, or having no\r\nimmediate use for the land, might have no inducement to oppose the use of it\");\r\nDarlington Cnty. v. Perkins, 269 S.C. 572, 576, 239 S.E.2d 69, 71 (1977) (finding\r\nthe unimproved and unenclosed woodland rule is inapplicable when the disputed\r\nproperty is improved land).\r\n\r\n2. Evidence in the record supports the circuit court's determination that Buyck\r\nestablished a prescriptive easement by adverse use and a claim of right. See\r\nCrossmann, 395 S.C. at 46-47, 717 S.E.2d at 592 (\"In an action at law tried\r\nwithout a jury, the appellate court will not disturb the trial court's findings of fact\r\nunless there is no evidence to reasonably support them.\" (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted)); Boyd v. Bellsouth Tel. Tel. Co., 369 S.C. 410, 419, 633 S.E.2d 136, 141\r\n(2006) (\"To establish a prescriptive easement, the party asserting the right must\r\nshow: (1) continued use for 20 years, (2) the identity of the thing enjoyed, and (3)\r\nuse which is either adverse or under a claim of right.\"). Specifically, evidence\r\nsupports a finding that Buyck's use was adverse because it was open, notorious,\r\ncontinuous, and uninterrupted. See id. (\"When the claimant has established that the\r\nuse was open, notorious, continuous, and uninterrupted, the use will be presumed\r\n\nto have been adverse.\"). Further, the totality of the circumstances of Buyck's use\r\nof the Red Road establishes the use was based upon a claim of right. See Hartley\r\nv. John Wesley United Methodist Church of Johns Island, 355 S.C. 145, 151, 584\r\nS.E.2d 386, 389 (Ct. App. 2003) (providing a party claiming a prescriptive\r\neasement under a claim of right \"must demonstrate a substantial belief that he had\r\nthe right to use the parcel or road based upon the totality of the circumstances\r\nsurrounding his use\" (emphasis omitted)).\r\n\r\n3. As to whether the prescriptive easement is appurtenant or in gross, we recognize\r\nthere is conflicting evidence in the record as to whether an alternative road\r\nprovides access to Buyck's property. However, based on our review of the\r\npreponderance of the evidence, we find the Red Road is necessary for Buyck's\r\nenjoyment of his property. Therefore, we affirm the circuit court's determination\r\nthat Buyck's easement is appurtenant. See Rhett v. Gray, 401 S.C. 478, 492, 736\r\nS.E.2d 873, 880 (Ct. App. 2012) (\"Determining whether an easement is in gross or\r\nappurtenant is a question in equity because it involves the extent of a grant of an\r\neasement.\"); Proctor v. Steedley, 398 S.C. 561, 571, 730 S.E.2d 357, 363 (Ct.

We disagree with Jackson's characterization that pursuant to the circuit court's\r\norder, \"anyone and everyone in the world\" may use the Red Road. Although the\r\ncircuit court's language at the end of the order allows Buyck and those \"to whom\r\nhe grants permission\" to use the Red Road, we find the order, when read as a\r\nwhole, narrows who may use the road and for what purpose. Specifically, the\r\norder defines the scope of the easement as those who performed certain activities\r\nduring the prescriptive period. Based on the entire order, the circuit court properly\r\nrestricted the use of the Red Road to the use that was established during the\r\nprescriptive period. See Burrell v. Kirkland, 242 S.C. 201, 207, 130 S.E.2d 470,\r\n473 (1963) (explaining the extent of a prescriptive easement is the use that\r\nestablished the easement); 28A C.J.S.

(Mother) appeals the termination of her parental\r\nrights (TPR) to her minor child (Child), arguing the family court erred in finding\r\nTPR was in Child's best interest. We reverse and remand.1\r\n\r\nThe family court may order TPR upon finding one or more of eleven statutory\r\ngrounds satisfied and also finding TPR is in the best interest of the child. S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 63-7-2570 (2010 & Supp. 2013). In a TPR action, the best interest of\r\nthe child is the paramount consideration. S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Smith, 343\r\nS.C. 129, 133, 538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct. App. 2000). \"The interests of the child\r\nshall prevail if the child's interest and the parental rights conflict.\" S.C. Code Ann.\r\n§ 63-7-2620 (2010). \"Appellate courts must consider the child's perspective, and\r\nnot the parent's, as the primary concern when determining whether TPR is\r\nappropriate.\" S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Sarah W., 402 S.C. 324, 343, 741 S.E.2d\r\n739, 749-50 (2013).\r\n\r\nWe find the family court erred in finding TPR was in Child's best interest. Child is\r\nthirteen years old, nonverbal, autistic, abusive, and requires 24-hour-a-day total\r\nassistance with all of his daily activities. Child currently lives in a residential\r\nfacility for autistic children where he will likely remain until he reaches the age of\r\neighteen. Additionally, Mother is mentally disabled and suffers from other health\r\nproblems, which limit her ability to care for Child. Child's Guardian Ad Litem\r\n(GAL) opined, \"While there is no doubt in anyone's mind that [Mother] loves\r\n[Child] very much and wants to provide for his needs and take care of [Child], it is\r\nvery doubtful that she will ever be capable of providing the necessary care.\" The\r\nfamily court found TPR was in Child's best interest because Child \"is at a\r\nresidential facility who [sic] can care for his every need and provide around-the-\r\nclock care.\" However, at the TPR hearing, Mother testified she would allow Child\r\nto remain at the facility if TPR was not granted. Furthermore, Child's Department\r\nof Social Services (DSS) caseworker testified that although two families were\r\ninterested in adoption, Child \"did not have a solid adoptive home.\" Thus, it is\r\n\r\n\r\n1The family court also terminated the parental rights of John W.B., Sr. (Father) to\r\nChild. Father did not file an appeal with this court. Therefore, this appeal has no\r\neffect on the family court's termination of Father's parental rights.\r\n\nunclear whether TPR will ensure future stability for Child. See S.C. Dep't of Soc.\r\nServs. v. Cameron N.F.L., 403 S.C. 323, 331, 742 S.E.2d 697, 701 (Ct. App. 2013)\r\n(finding TPR was not in the child's best interest when the child bonded with the\r\nmother, the child was not a viable candidate for adoption, and DSS had not\r\nidentified a pre-adoptive home). We are aware reunification may not be a\r\npossibility given Mother's disability and Child's special needs. However, in light\r\nof Mother's willingness to allow Child to remain at his current facility,2 we believe\r\nit is in Child's best interest to keep Mother's parental rights intact. See S.C. Dep't\r\nof Soc. Servs. v. Janice C., 383 S.C. 221, 229-31, 678 S.E.2d 463, 467-68 (Ct. App.\r\n2009) (reversing TPR and allowing the children to \"remain in their current foster\r\ncare home where they [we]re receiving the services they need[ed]\" even though\r\nthere was testimony the mother would probably never be able to adequately parent\r\nthe children due to a mental disability). Accordingly, we reverse the family court's\r\nTPR as to Mother and remand this case to the family court. Child shall remain at\r\nhis current facility in DSS custody. On remand, the family court is instructed to\r\nissue an order consistent with this opinion and section 63-7-1700(I)(5) of the South\r\nCarolina Code (Supp. 2013).3\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, GEATHERS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 We note Mother acknowledged during oral argument that Child should remain at\r\nthe facility and it would not be in his best interest to return to her care.\r\n3 S.C.
