McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General\r\n          Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General William M. Blitch, Jr., all of\r\n          Columbia; Solicitor Scarlett Wilson, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Zeb Eron Binnarr appeals his conviction\r\n  for failing to register as a sex offender.Â \r\n  On appeal, he argues the trial court erred in: (1) holding the applicable sex\r\n  offender registration statutes did not have a notice requirement; (2) holding\r\n  the lack of a notification requirement in section 23-3-460 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2009) did not violate his procedural due process rights;\r\n  and (3) denying his motion for directed verdict.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\n1. A review of the statutory language\r\n  in section 23-3-460 indicates the Legislature did not include language\r\n  requiring the State to notify sex offenders about the change in registration\r\n  requirements when it amended the statute in 2006 to require registration on a\r\n  biannual basis.Â  A clear reading of section 23-3-440 reveals the statute only\r\n  requires the State to give notice of the registration requirement to a sex\r\n  offender within one day of the sex offender's release from prison.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-440(1) (2007) (emphasis added) (stating &quot;the\r\n  Department of Probation, Parole, and Pardon Services shall provide verbal and\r\n  written notification to the offender that he must register with the sheriff of\r\n  the county in which he intends to reside within one business day of his\r\n    release.&quot;).Â  Any attempt to insert the notification requirement of\r\n  section 23-3-440 into section 23-3-460 would run contrary to the plain and\r\n  ordinary meaning of both statutes.Â  See TNS Mills, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't\r\n    of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 624, 503 S.E.2d 471, 478 (1998) (&quot;Subtle or\r\n  forced construction of statutory words for the purpose of expanding a statute's\r\n  operation is prohibited.&quot;).Â  Accordingly, the trial court correctly held\r\n  the applicable sex offender statutes did not require the State to notify Binnar\r\n  of the change in registration requirements.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n2. We hold the trial court correctly\r\n  held section 23-3-460 did not violate Binnarr's procedural due process rights.Â \r\n  The amendment to section 23-3-460 changing the registration requirements for\r\n  sex offenders to a biannual basis became effective on July 1, 2006, one month\r\n  before Binnarr was required to register with the sheriff's office.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-460 (Supp. 2009).Â  Thus, Binnarr had fair notice that the\r\n  failure to register on a biannual basis could result in a crime because the\r\n  amendment became effective one month before he was required to begin\r\n  registering on a biannual basis starting in August 2006.Â  See State\r\n    v. Edwards, 302 S.C. 492, 494, 397 S.E.2d 88, 89-90 (1990) (stating if a\r\n  criminal offense takes place after the effective date of a statutory amendment,\r\n  a defendant has fair notice that the conduct referenced in the amendment is\r\n  criminal); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-470 (Supp. 2009) (stating the failure to\r\n  register is a criminal offense).Â  Additionally, the sheriff's office provided\r\n  fair notice to Binnarr of the new registration requirements when it mailed a\r\n  blanket notice and a certified letter to Binnarr's residence.Â  \r\n3. Since Binnarr did not renew his\r\n  motion for directed verdict at the close of all evidence, this issue is not\r\n  preserved for our review.Â  See State v. Bailey, 368 S.C. 39, 43\r\n  n.4, 626 S.E.2d 898, 900 n.4 (Ct. App. 2006) (&quot;If a defendant presents\r\n  evidence after the denial of his directed verdict motion at the close of the\r\n  State's case, he must make another directed verdict motion at the close of all\r\n  evidence in order to appeal the sufficiency of the evidence.&quot;).Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nHUFF, A.C.J.,\r\n  THOMAS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-078","title":"The State v.

Giese, all of Columbia, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Roger\r\n  Dejon Smith appeals his conviction for assault and battery of a high and\r\n  aggravated nature (ABHAN).Â  Smith argues the trial court lacked subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction over his guilty plea because it did not discuss his waiver of\r\n  presentment during the guilty plea and failed to obtain a valid waiver of\r\n  presentment on the record.Â  We\r\n  affirm.[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nArticle V, section 11 of the\r\n  South Carolina Constitution grants circuit courts with original jurisdiction\r\n  over all criminal cases:Â  \r\n\r\n  The\r\n    Circuit Court shall be a general trial court with original jurisdiction in\r\n    civil and criminal cases, except those cases in which exclusive jurisdiction\r\n    shall be given to inferior courts, and shall have such appellate jurisdiction\r\n    as provided by law.Â  \r\n\r\nSee also State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 101, 610 S.E.2d\r\n  494, 499 (2005) (&quot;Circuit courts obviously have subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction to try criminal matters.&quot;).Â  \r\nArticle I, section 11 of the\r\n  South Carolina Constitution recognizes a defendant's right to be notified of\r\n  any criminal charges made against him:\r\n\r\n  No\r\n    person may be held to answer for any crime the jurisdiction over which is not\r\n    within the magistrate's court, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand\r\n    jury of the county where the crime has been committed . . . . The General\r\n    Assembly may provide for the waiver of an indictment by the accused.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Supreme\r\n  Court has repeatedly emphasized the presentment of an indictment and the trial\r\n  court's subject matter jurisdiction in criminal cases are two distinct issues\r\n  that are not dependent on each other.Â  See Gentry, 363 S.C. at\r\n  101-02 n.6, 610 S.E.2d at 499 n.6 (&quot;We note that a presentment of an\r\n  indictment or a waiver of presentment is not needed to confer subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction on the circuit court. However, an indictment is needed to give\r\n  notice to the defendant of the charge(s) against him.&quot;); Evans v. State,\r\n  363 S.C. 495, 509, 611 S.E.2d 510, 518 (2005) (citations omitted) (&quot;A\r\n  defendant has a constitutional right to demand that a grand jury which is\r\n  properly established and constituted under the law consider the criminal\r\n  allegations against him . . . .

Jeff Goodwyn, Jr., of Columbia, for\r\n          Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission\r\n  (Appellate Panel) denied Dana Anderson's claim for disability benefits.Â  The\r\n  circuit court affirmed, and Anderson appeals, arguing the Appellate Panel erred\r\n  by: (1) failing to consider the testimony or provide sufficient findings of\r\n  fact regarding three of his witnesses; and (2) finding he did not suffer an\r\n  injury by accident.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\n1. The Appellate Panel\r\n  properly considered the testimony of Anderson's witnesses and issued sufficient\r\n  findings of fact in its order.Â  The Appellate Panel stated in its order that it\r\n  considered all testimony and documentary evidence submitted by the parties.Â  As\r\n  the ultimate finder of fact, the Appellate Panel had discretion to determine\r\n  the credibility and weight of all testimonial evidence and properly issued\r\n  adequate, although brief, findings of fact supporting its conclusion that Anderson\r\n  did not sustain an injury in the course of his employment.Â  See Bartley\r\n    v. Allendale County Sch. Dist., 381 S.C. 262, 271, 672 S.E.2d 809, 813 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2009) (holding the Appellate Panel is the ultimate finder of fact and\r\n  makes the final determination of witness credibility and weight of the\r\n  evidence); Brayboy v. Clark Heating Co., Inc., 306 S.C. 56, 58-59, 409\r\n  S.E.2d 767, 768 (1991) (&quot;The findings of fact of an administrative body\r\n  must be sufficiently detailed to enable the reviewing court to determine whether\r\n  the findings are supported by the evidence and whether the law has been\r\n  properly applied to those findings.&quot;).Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n2. Substantial evidence in\r\n  the record supports the Appellate Panel's ruling that Anderson did not suffer\r\n  an injury by accident.Â  The single commissioner and the Appellate Panel found\r\n  Anderson was not a credible witness.Â  Additionally, no other witnesses directly\r\n  observed Anderson injuring his leg while at work.Â  See Hill v. Eagle\r\n    Motor Lines, 373 S.C. 422, 436, 645 S.E.2d 424, 431 (2007) (holding the\r\n  decisions of the Appellate Panel must be affirmed if the factual findings are\r\n  supported by substantial evidence in the record).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, THOMAS,\r\n  and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â \r\n  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-084","title":"The State v.

Gossett, Administrative Law\r\nJudge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2010-UP-093 \r\n  Submitted February 1, 2010 â€“ Filed\r\nFebruary 3, 2010Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Robert Wesley Jacobs, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Douglas Gilbert, pro se, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The South Carolina Department of\r\n  Corrections (the Department) appeals the Administrative Law Court's (ALC)\r\n  reversal of Gilbert's disciplinary conviction. The Department contends the ALC\r\n  erred because substantial evidence establishes Gilbert intentionally destroyed\r\n  prison property.Â  We affirm.[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nFACTS\r\nThe Department charged\r\n  Gilbert with violating an internal prison policy for damaging or destroying\r\n  prison property after an exit sign above a library door fell to the ground.Â  At\r\n  the disciplinary hearing, Gilbert testified he went to the prison library to\r\n  return two books, but the prison officer in the library did not allow him to\r\n  enter.Â  Gilbert explained the prison officer wanted him to place the books\r\n  inside the library box.Â  Gilbert denied banging or kicking the library door,\r\n  but admitted he saw the sign above the library door fall to the ground as he\r\n  was speaking with the prison officer.Â  \r\nPrison Officer Patricia Cooks\r\n  testified she heard Gilbert yelling outside of the library door, requesting to\r\n  come in.Â  Cooks stated Gilbert started to kick and bang on the library door\r\n  &quot;so hard that the exit sign above the door fell off and landed on the\r\n  floor.&quot;Â  Cooks explained Gilbert was the only inmate outside the library\r\n  door at the time of the incident.Â  Cooks testified she radioed another\r\n  prison officer, Officer Chris Hicks, after the sign fell because she\r\n  &quot;wanted him to witness the sign on the floor and [she] didn't want Gilbert\r\n  to hurt [her] or anything.&quot;Â  Officer Hicks testified when he arrived, the\r\n  sign was already on the floor and Gilbert was the only inmate outside of the\r\n  library door, but he did not observe Gilbert kicking the door.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Department convicted Gilbert of damaging or destroying prison property, and\r\n  Gilbert appealed the decision to the ALC, contending the conviction should be\r\n  overturned because the prison officer was lying about what he saw on the\r\n  surveillance video.Â  The ALC reversed Gilbert's conviction:Â  \r\nConsidering\r\n  the testimony and report, there was insufficient evidence to allow the\r\n  Department reasonably to reach the conclusion that Gilbert is guilty of\r\n  [damaging or destroying prison property] when there was no evidence of\r\n  Gilbert's intent to destroy or damage the exit sign.Â  Moreover, [the\r\n  Department] did not make any specific findings of Gilbert's intent.Â  See Al Shabazz, 338 S.C. at 372, 527 S.E.2d at 752 (&quot;When an inmate is\r\n  found guilty, the officer must prepare a written report containing, among other\r\n  things, the evidence presented and considered, the reasons for a determination\r\n  of guilt . . . . &quot;).Â  Nor did the Department provide any evidence that it\r\n  determined that Gilbert had intended to bang on a library door in order to make\r\n  the exit sign fall and become damaged.Â  See Am. Jur. Torts Â§ 18\r\n  (&quot;A willful act is one done intentionally, or on purpose, and not\r\n  accidentally.Â  An injury is willful where the act that produced it was intended\r\n  to have that effect.&quot;).Â  In short, the Department failed to establish with\r\n  sufficient evidence that Gilbert intentionally damaged or destroyed the exit\r\n  sign.\r\nThis appeal followed. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe ALC did not err in\r\n  reversing Gilbert's conviction for damaging or destroying prison property.Â \r\n  Under the ALC's definition of intent as &quot;one done intentionally, or on\r\n  purpose, and not accidentallyÂ  . . . where the act that produced it was\r\n  intended to have that effect,&quot; substantial evidence supports the ALC's\r\n  ruling.Â  While Cook's testimony at the disciplinary hearing establishes Gilbert\r\n  intentionally attempted to damage the door when Cook forbade him from entering\r\n  the library, it does not demonstrate Gilbert intentionally destroyed the exit\r\n  sign above the door when he when he banged and kicked the library door.Â \r\n  Additionally, Hicks's testimony only establishes Gilbert's presence in front of\r\n  the library door after the exit sign fell, but not whether Gilbert actually\r\n  directed his actions towards damaging the sign.Â  Accordingly, the ALC correctly\r\n  reversed Gilbert's conviction because insufficient evidence existed showing\r\n  Gilbert intended to destroy the exit sign.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  1-23-610(B) (Supp. 2009); S.C. Dep't of Corrs. v. Mitchell, 377 S.C.\r\n  256, 659 S.E.2d 233 (Ct. App. 2008) (stating this court may reverse or modify\r\n  the ALC's ruling only if the substantive rights of the appellant have been\r\n  prejudiced because the decision is clearly erroneous in light of the reliable\r\n  and substantial evidence on the whole record, arbitrary, characterized by an\r\n  abuse of discretion, or affected by other error of law).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, THOMAS, and KONDUROS.\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-094","title":"SC DSS v.

Kinard Johnson, Jr., Family Court\r\n  Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2010-UP-140\r\nSubmitted February 1, 2010 â€“ Filed\r\n  February 22, 2010\r\nREVERSED \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tWilliam B. Chisholm, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tKenneth C. Porter, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this domestic relations action, William Barry\r\n  Chisholm (Husband) appeals the family court's order subsequent to divorce,\r\n  arguing the family court erred in requiring him to pay one hundred percent of\r\n  his son's private-school tuition and a portion of his ex-wife's attorney's\r\n  fees.Â  We reverse.[1]\r\nHusband and Susan Elaine Chisholm (Wife) married in 1979.Â  Their marriage\r\n  produced two children, Daughter and Son.Â  In July 2001, following Daughter's\r\n  graduation from high school, Husband filed for divorce.Â  On April 4, 2003, the\r\n  family court granted the divorce based upon one year's continuous separation\r\n  and required Husband to pay one hundred percent of Son's remaining\r\n  private-school tuition, as well as $13,000 toward Wife's attorney's fees.[2]Â  Both Husband and Wife appealed, and\r\n  this court reversed and remanded the issues of Husband's contributions to Son's\r\n  private-school tuition and Wife's attorney's fees.Â  Chisholm v. Chisholm,\r\n  Op. No. 2005-UP-067 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Jan. 25, 2005).Â  No appeal was taken\r\n  from this opinion.Â  On remand, the family court heard additional evidence and\r\n  reduced Husband's obligation for Wife's attorney's fees from $13,000 to $10,500\r\n  but declined to alter Husband's obligation for Son's tuition or child support.Â \r\n  Husband filed a motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, which\r\n  the family court denied.Â  In May 2005, the family court terminated Husband's\r\n  child support obligation because Son completed high school and turned eighteen\r\n  that month.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nOn appeal from the family court, the appellate court has\r\n  jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance\r\n  of the evidence.Â  Epperly v. Epperly, 312 S.C. 411, 414, 440 S.E.2d 884,\r\n  885 (1994).Â  However, in a family court matter, &quot;[t]he award of attorney's\r\n  fees is left to the discretion of the trial judge and will only be disturbed\r\n  upon a showing of abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  Upchurch v. Upchurch, 367\r\n  S.C. 16, 28, 624 S.E.2d 643, 648 (2006).\r\nWe agree with Husband's assertion the family court erred in\r\n  requiring him to pay one hundred percent of Son's tuition for his junior and\r\n  senior years in high school.Â  We find the family court's order contravened our\r\n  unappealed opinion requiring the family court to allocate Son's tuition costs or to reduce Husband's child support\r\n  obligation to offset his tuition payments.Â  See Chisholm v. Chisholm, Op. No. 2005-UP-067 (S.C. Ct. App. filed\r\n  Jan. 25, 2005); see also Ables\r\n    v. Gladden, 378 S.C. 558, 569, 664\r\n  S.E.2d 442, 448 (2008) (holding an unappealed ruling is the law of the case).Â  Although the family court held an evidentiary hearing\r\n  at which it invited Husband to submit evidence of his expenses, it failed to\r\n  modify its order as to either tuition or child support.Â  We find adequate\r\n  information to make this determination was already before the family court and\r\n  reflected in its own orders.Â  Consequently, this failure was error.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  light of the unappealed prior decision of this court and the evidence of\r\n  record, we find Husband responsible for fifty-nine percent of Son's junior and\r\n  senior years' tuition and Wife responsible for forty-one percent. Â See Epperly, 312 S.C. at 414, 440 S.E.2d at 885.Â  In its December 11, 2001, order, the family court\r\n  found Husband's gross monthly income was $6,066.66, or fifty-nine percent of\r\n  the parental income, and Wife's was $4,215.42, or forty-one percent of the\r\n  parental income.Â  The Child Support Worksheet prepared by Wife's counsel on\r\n  March 28, 2003, reflects similar numbers, with a similar division of parental\r\n  responsibility.Â  The record does not reflect the family court modified its\r\n  December 2001 findings at any time.Â  At the hearing on remand, Husband did not\r\n  know the total he had paid toward Son's tuition; however, he testified he paid\r\n  the entire cost of Son's tuition for the final two years of high school.[3]Â \r\n  Wife presented no evidence of any payment.Â  Therefore, the family court erred\r\n  in failing to allocate Son's tuition cost between the parties. \r\nWe also agree with Husband's assertion the family court erred in\r\n  requiring him to pay a portion of Wife's attorney's fees and costs, while\r\n  refusing to require Wife to contribute to Husband's.Â  \r\nUnder South Carolina law, the family court has jurisdiction to\r\n  determine whether to award attorney's fees in a matter properly before it.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-3-530(A) (2009).Â  However, &quot;[a]n order or judgment pursuant to an adjudication in a domestic\r\n  relations case shall set forth the specific findings of fact and conclusions of\r\n  law to support the court's decision.&quot;Â  Rule 26(a), SCRFC.Â Â  In deciding whether to award attorney's\r\n  fees upon request of a party, &quot;the court should evaluate the requesting\r\n  party's ability to pay, the parties' respective financial conditions, the\r\n  effect of the award on each party's standard of living, and the beneficial\r\n  results achieved.&quot;Â  Upchurch, 367 S.C. at 28, 624 S.E.2d at 648.Â  A\r\n  beneficial result will not secure an award of attorney's fees where the other\r\n  factors do not support such an award.Â  Mazzone v. Miles, 341 S.C. 203,\r\n  214, 532 S.E.2d 890, 895 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\nWe hereby reverse the family court's attorney's fees award to Wife\r\n  because the family court failed to support its award with the required findings\r\n  of fact.Â  In awarding attorney's fees, the family court is required to evaluate\r\n  each of the four factors enunciated in Upchurch and to set forth\r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting its decision.Â  367 S.C. at\r\n  28, 624 S.E.2d at 648; Rule 26(a), SCRFC.Â  Here, the family court considered\r\n  only one factor, both in its original adjudication and on remand.Â  The findings\r\n  pertaining to the sole factor addressed in the family court's two orders, the\r\n  achievement of beneficial results, are insufficient to support an award of\r\n  attorney's fees.Â  In failing to find facts relating to the Wife's ability to\r\n  pay, each party's financial condition, and the effect of the award on the\r\n  parties' respective standards of living, the family court abused its discretion\r\n  in awarding attorney's fees to Wife.Â  See Mazzone, 341 S.C. at\r\n  214, 532 S.E.2d at 895.Â  \r\nFurthermore, we find neither Husband nor Wife proved facts\r\n  sufficient to support an award of attorney's fees.Â  See Epperly,\r\n  312 S.C. at 414, 440 S.E.2d at 885 (holding the appellate court has\r\n  jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance\r\n  of the evidence when reviewing family court decisions).Â  The family court\r\n  observed Wife had incurred more than $21,000 in attorney's fees, and Husband\r\n  testified he had incurred approximately $41,000 in attorney's fees.Â  \r\nWith regard to the first three Upchurch factors, the record\r\n  reflects both Husband and Wife are gainfully employed, earning approximately\r\n  $80,000 and approximately $50,000 per year, respectively.Â  Moreover, the family\r\n  court's apportionment of marital property provided both Husband and Wife with additional\r\n  financial resources in the form of multiple individual retirement accounts.Â \r\n  Although Husband's overall financial condition, according to the record, is\r\n  somewhat stronger than Wife's, the record does not indicate that either party\r\n  would suffer hardship from paying his or her own attorney's fees.Â  Wife's\r\n  financial condition is somewhat weaker, but Husband incurred a great deal more\r\n  debt to his attorneys.Â  As a result, both parties would likely see a decline in\r\n  their standards of living until their attorney's fees were paid off.Â  Finally,\r\n  with regard to beneficial results, the family court correctly found Wife\r\n  prevailed on the hotly contested issue of custody of Son.Â  Husband prevailed on\r\n  the less contentious issue of liberal visitation with Son, issues relating to\r\n  identification and equitable apportionment of marital assets, and, following\r\n  the first appeal, the issue of Son's tuition.Â  Consequently, our review of\r\n  these factors does not indicate either party is entitled to an award of\r\n  attorney's fees and costs.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the order of the family court is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nPIEPER, GEATHERS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The tuition at issue is only for Son's junior and\r\n  senior years.Â  Husband paid tuition for Son's freshman year outright.Â  Husband\r\n  and Wife funded the tuition for Son's sophomore year pursuant to an agreement\r\n  between them:Â  Wife secured financial aid and Husband paid a portion of tuition\r\n  for Son's sophomore year.Â  The April 2003 family court order from which appeal\r\n  was originally taken stated, &quot;Father is to enable the child to attend\r\n  Christ Church Episcopal School until he graduates from high school.&quot;Â \r\n  Because this language is prospective and the family court made no effort to\r\n  require Husband to reimburse Wife for any payments she may have made toward\r\n  tuition during the sophomore year, we address parental obligations for junior\r\n  and senior years, only.\r\n[3] Husband attached to his brief supporting his Rule\r\n  59(e) motion tuition records obtained from the records custodian of Christ\r\n  Church Episcopal School.Â  These records reflect the dates and amounts of all\r\n  payments made to Son's account for his junior and senior years, including those\r\n  made by Wife.Â  Although this information was not available for the family\r\n  court's consideration at the hearing on remand, it is clearly available for the\r\n  parties' use in calculating their respective obligations pursuant to this\r\n  opinion.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-141","title":"State v.

Elliott, Assistant\r\n  Attorney General Julie M. Thames, Office of the Attorney General, all of\r\n  Columbia; Solicitor Robert Mills Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM: Marques A. Hudson (Hudson) appeals\r\n  his conviction for infliction of great bodily injury upon a child.Â  On appeal,\r\n  Hudson argues the trial court erred in (1) refusing to charge the jury on\r\n  assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN) as a lesser included\r\n  offense of infliction of great bodily injury upon a child, (2) allowing the\r\n  pediatric ophthalmologist to testify as to what the medical team wanted to\r\n  believe in determining the cause of the victim's injuries, and (3) failing to\r\n  follow the requisite procedures pursuant to a Batson challenge.Â  We\r\n  affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  October 12, 2003, the Greenville County Emergency Medical Services (EMS) responded\r\n  to an emergency at Hudsonâ€™s apartment in Greenville, South Carolina.Â  The\r\n  victim, a sixteen-month-old female, was found unresponsive and was transported\r\n  to Greenville Memorial Hospital in critical condition.Â  On November 16, 2004,\r\n  Hudson was indicted for infliction of great bodily injury upon a child pursuant\r\n  to section 16-3-95 of the South Carolina Code (2007).\r\nAt\r\n  trial, several physicians testified as expert witnesses for the State.Â  The\r\n  physicians concluded the victim's injuries were inconsistent with Hudson's\r\n  account of the events.Â  In reaching this conclusion, the physicians noted\r\n  bruising on the victim's forehead, chest, back, thighs, numerous retinal\r\n  hemorrhages, an acute subdural hemorrhage, and injury to the victim's\r\n  pancreas.Â  Dr. Allison Jones, a pediatric emergency room physician at\r\n  Greenville Memorial Hospital, concluded the victim could not have been injured\r\n  so seriously based on Hudson's account.Â  Dr. Robert Seigler (Dr. Seigler), the\r\n  medical director of the pediatric intensive care unit at Greenville Memorial\r\n  Hospital, testified the injury to the victim's pancreas resulted from &quot;a\r\n  pretty firm hit&quot; and the subdural hemorrhage and retinal hemorrhages\r\n  required massive force.Â  According to Dr. Seigler, subdural hemorrhages\r\n  normally result from high speed motor vehicle accidents or a large animal\r\n  kicking a person in the head.Â  Dr. Seigler also noted retinal hemorrhages are\r\n  not usually seen even in severe car accidents.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Dr. Seigler testified that a\r\n  sixteen-month-old victim could suffer subdural and retinal hemorrhages from\r\n  shaking alone but acknowledged a medical debate exists on whether shaking alone\r\n  or shaking in conjunction with throwing causes these injuries.Â  In sum, Dr.\r\n  Seigler concluded the subdural and retinal hemorrhages were inconsistent with a\r\n  bathtub and stairwell fall but acknowledged the possibility that some of the\r\n  forehead bruising could have resulted from such events.Â  \r\nDr. Anthony Johnson (Dr. Johnson), a\r\n  pediatric ophthalmologist, also concluded the retinal hemorrhages were\r\n  non-accidental and required a great deal of force.Â  To support his conclusion,\r\n  Dr. Johnson cited to an article that examined three-hundred and sixty children\r\n  who suffered injuries on stairs.Â  He expressly noted that some significant\r\n  bruising did occur in the children in the study but none of the children\r\n  sustained retinal hemorrhages.Â  \r\nAfter the State's presentation of evidence,\r\n  Hudson testified.Â  In explaining the cause of the victim's injuries, Hudson\r\n  testified the victim slipped in the bathtub and hit her head on the soap dish\r\n  while he was washing her.Â  Hudson testified that after the victim hit her head,\r\n  she entered the water face down.Â  Hudson further testified that in the process\r\n  of contacting EMS from a neighbor's telephone, he slipped on a blanket and tumbled\r\n  down the stairwell while holding the victim.Â  After closing arguments, the\r\n  trial court charged the jury with infliction of great bodily injury upon a\r\n  child.Â  \r\nThe jury found Hudson\r\n  guilty of infliction of great bodily injury upon a child, and the trial court\r\n  sentenced him to fifteen years in prison.Â  This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases,\r\n  the appellate court sits to review errors of law only. State v. Martucci, 380\r\n  S.C. 232, 246, 669 S.E.2d 598, 605-06 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2008).Â  This court is bound by the trial court's\r\n  factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. State v. Baccus, 367\r\n  S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220&nbsp;(2006).Â  This court does not reevaluate\r\n  the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply\r\n  determines whether the trial judge's ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  State\r\n    v. Moore, 374 S.C. 468, 473-74, 649 S.E.2d 84, 86 (Ct. App. 2007).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Jury Charge\r\nHudson\r\n  argues the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury on ABHAN because it\r\n  is a lesser included offense of infliction of great bodily injury upon a\r\n  child.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe question of whether ABHAN is a lesser included\r\n  offense of infliction of great bodily injury upon a child is a novel question\r\n  of law.Â  Under the elements test, &quot;[t]he lesser\r\n  offense is included in the greater only if each of its elements is always a\r\n  necessary element of the greater offense.&quot;Â  State v. Easler, 327\r\n  S.C. 121, 134, 489 S.E.2d 617, 624 (1997). Therefore, our inquiry is limited to\r\n  whether the elements of ABHAN are always necessary elements of infliction of\r\n  great bodily injury upon a child.\r\nSouth Carolina\r\n  courts have interpreted ABHAN as &quot;an unlawful act of violent injury\r\n  accompanied by circumstances of aggravation.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Geiger, 370 S.C. 600,\r\n  605, 635 S.E.2d, 669, 672 (Ct. App. 2006). Circumstances of aggravation\r\n  include: the use of a deadly weapon, intent to commit a felony, infliction of\r\n  serious bodily injury, great disparity in the ages or physical conditions of\r\n  the parties, difference in gender, taking indecent liberties or familiarities\r\n  with a female, purposeful infliction of shame and disgrace, and resistance to\r\n  lawful authority.Â  Id. at 605-06, 635 S.E.2d at 672.\r\n\r\n  Section 16-3-95 defines infliction of great bodily injury upon a\r\n  child as follows:\r\n\r\n\t(A) It is unlawful to inflict great bodily injury upon\r\n  a child. A person who violates this subsection is guilty of a felony and, upon\r\n  conviction, must be imprisoned not more than twenty years.\r\n\t(B) It is unlawful for a child's parent or guardian,\r\n  person with whom the child's parent or guardian is cohabitating, or any other\r\n  person responsible for a child's welfare as defined in Section 63-7-20\r\n  knowingly to allow another person to inflict great bodily injury upon a child.\r\n  A person who violates this subsection is guilty of a felony and, upon\r\n  conviction, must be imprisoned not more than five years.\r\n\t(C) For purposes of this section, &quot;great bodily\r\n  injury&quot; means bodily injury which creates a substantial risk of death or\r\n  which causes serious or permanent disfigurement, or protracted loss or\r\n  impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ.\r\n\t(D) This section may not be construed to prohibit\r\n  corporal punishment or physical discipline which is administered by a parent or\r\n  person in loco parentis in a manner which does not cause great bodily\r\n  injury upon a child.\r\n\t(E) This section does not apply to traffic accidents\r\n  unless the accident was caused by the driver's reckless disregard for the\r\n  safety of others.\r\n\r\nHudson argues section 16-3-95[2] implicitly includes circumstances of aggravation such as serious bodily injury,\r\n  difference in ages, and difference in sizes. \r\nIn Knox v. State,\r\n  340 S.C. 81, 530 S.E.2d 887 (2000), overruled on other grounds by State v.\r\n    Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005), our supreme court held that\r\n  ABHAN is not a lesser included offense of second degree lynching.Â  In holding\r\n  ABHAN was not a lesser included offense of second degree lynching, the Knox court stated, &quot;Since\r\n  there are other circumstances of aggravation to establish ABHAN that are not\r\n  included in the definition of second degree lynching, ABHAN is not a lesser included\r\n  offense.&quot;Â  340 S.C. at 85, 610 S.E.2d at 889.Â  Moreover, in State v. Easler, our\r\n  supreme court concluded ABHAN is not a lesser included offense of felony DUI for\r\n  double jeopardy purposes because each circumstance of aggravation for ABHAN is\r\n  not always a necessary element of felony DUI.Â  Easler, 327 S.C. at 134,\r\n  489 S.E.2d at 624.\r\nRegardless of whether circumstances of aggravation are\r\n  present in this case, Hudsonâ€™s argument is without merit.Â  Our inquiry is\r\n  premised on whether the lesser included offense is always a necessary element\r\n  of the greater offense.Â  A circumstance of aggravation is a necessary element\r\n  of ABHAN not included in the greater offense of infliction of great bodily\r\n  injury upon a child.Â  Therefore, ABHAN is not a lesser included offense of\r\n  infliction of great bodily injury upon a child.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pediatric Ophthalmologistâ€™s\r\n  Testimony \r\nHudson contends the\r\n  trial court erred in allowing Dr. Johnson to testify as to what the medical\r\n  team would like to find in regard to head injury patients.Â  We conclude\r\n  Hudson's argument is not preserved for review.\r\nAt trial, Dr.\r\n  Johnson testified, &quot;Every time a head injury patient is evaluated and\r\n  cared for the team would like nothing more than to find some other explanation\r\n  other than a non-accidental injury.Â  None of the team wants to find that, and\r\n  therefore, all of the ---.&quot;Â  Hudson's counsel objected and stated, &quot;Your\r\n  Honor, I object to this doctor speaking for the team---.&quot;Â  The trial court\r\n  sustained Hudsonâ€™s objection. \r\nOn appeal, Hudson\r\n  argues Dr. Johnson's testimony did not qualify as scientific or technical\r\n  knowledge pursuant to Rule 702, SCRE, and Dr. Johnson lacked the personal\r\n  knowledge required for a witness pursuant to Rule 602, SCRE.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  Hudson contends Dr. Johnsonâ€™s testimony was hearsay in violation of Rule 802,\r\n  SCRE, and was prejudicial in violation of Rule 403, SCRE. \r\nA contemporaneous\r\n  objection is required to preserve an issue relating to the admissibility of\r\n  evidence.Â  State v. Wannamaker, 346 S.C. 495, 499, 552 S.E.2d 284, 286 (2001). The objection should be\r\n  addressed to the trial court in a sufficiently specific manner that brings\r\n  attention to the exact error. State v. Johnson,&nbsp;363 S.C. 53, 58,\r\n  609 S.E.2d 520, 523&nbsp;(2005).Â  Rule 103(a)(1), SCRE, states that a party\r\n  must state the specific ground of objection if the specific ground is not\r\n  apparent from the context.Â  See State v. Sweet, 374 S.C. 1, 6,\r\n  647 S.E.2d 202, 205 (2007).Â  \r\nHudson's\r\n  contemporaneous objection was limited solely to the issue of Dr. Johnson's role\r\n  in speaking on behalf of the medical team.Â  As a result, Hudson's arguments\r\n  regarding Rule 702, 602, and 403, SCRE, were neither raised to nor ruled upon\r\n  by the trial court at the time of Hudson's objection.Â  Accordingly, Hudson's\r\n  arguments on those grounds are not preserved for appellate review.Â  Nicholson\r\n    v. Nicholson, 378 S.C. 523, 537, 663 S.E.2d 74, 81&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2008) (&quot;It is axiomatic that an issue cannot\r\n  be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised\r\n  to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.&quot;) (citation\r\n  omitted).\r\nEven though we find\r\n  Hudson's counsel did not specifically object based on Rule 802, SCRE, his\r\n  hearsay objection was specific enough from the context.Â  Sweet, 374 S.C.\r\n  at 6, 647 S.E.2d at 205 (â€œ[A]n objection must be sufficiently specific to\r\n  inform the trial court of the point being urged by the objector.â€)Â  Nevertheless,\r\n  we conclude Hudsonâ€™s hearsay argument is not preserved for review.\r\nWhere an objection\r\n  is sustained but objecting counsel does not move to strike the evidence, the issue is not preserved for\r\n  appellate review.Â  Martucci, 380 S.C. at 259, 669 S.E.2d at 612-13.Â \r\n  Furthermore, if counsel does not request a curative instruction or mistrial\r\n  after an objection has been sustained, counsel received what he asked for and\r\n  cannot be heard to complain on appeal.Â  McKissick v. J.F. Cleckley &amp;\r\n    Co., 325 S.C. 327, 350, 479\r\n  S.E.2d 67, 79 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  An examination of the record reveals Hudson's\r\n  counsel neither moved to strike the testimony nor requested a curative\r\n  instruction or moved for a mistrial after the objection was sustained.Â  As a\r\n  result, Hudson's hearsay argument is not preserved.\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Batson Challenge\r\nHudson also contends the trial court erred in not\r\n  following the procedure for a Batson challenge after defense counsel\r\n  objected to the exclusion of an African-American lawyer.Â  We conclude this\r\n  issue is not preserved for review.Â  \r\nAfter the State\r\n  struck an African-American lawyer, no African-American jurors remained in the\r\n  jury pool.Â  The State's proffered reason for striking the African-American\r\n  lawyer was based on the lawyer's &quot;great deal of criminal defense\r\n  work.&quot;Â  However, Hudson argues two white lawyers were still seated on the\r\n  jury, which proves the State struck the other juror solely on the basis of race\r\n  in violation of Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).[3]Â Â  \r\nWe decline to reach\r\n  the merits of Hudson's Batson challenge.Â  Hudson's counsel did not make\r\n  a contemporaneous objection to the trial court's procedure once the judge\r\n  inquired into the state's reason for striking the African-American lawyer.Â  State\r\n    v. Johnson,&nbsp;363 S.C. at 58, 609 S.E.2d at 523&nbsp;(2005) (holding to\r\n  preserve an issue for review there must be a contemporaneous objection that is\r\n  ruled upon by the trial court).Â  It is clear from the record that Hudsonâ€™s\r\n  counsel objected to the selection of the jury after the jury was sworn.Â \r\n  As a result, Hudsonâ€™s failure to state a timely objection bars appellate\r\n  review. See State v. Edwards, 374 S.C. 543, 649 S.E.2d 112 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2007) overruled on other grounds by State v. Edwards, 384 S.C. 504,\r\n  682 S.E.2d 820 (2009).Â  (&quot;In order to raise and preserve\r\n  a Batson issue, the opposing party must move for the hearing after the\r\n  jury is selected but before it is sworn.&quot;)Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  trial court's decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS, PIEPER,\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Counsel for Hudson and the State cited to the\r\n  pre-amended version of section 16-3-95.Â  See S.C.

Â§16-3-95\r\n  (Supp. 2007).Â  The amended version of this statute currently references section\r\n  63-7-20 instead of section 20-7-490(3); however, the amended version preserves\r\n  the substantive law of section 16-3-95.\r\n[3] In Batson, the United States Supreme\r\n  Court held the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution\r\n  prohibits a prosecutor from challenging potential jurors solely on the basis of\r\n  race.Â  Batson, 476 U.S. at 89.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-143","title":"The State v.

Â Semken v. Semken, 379 S.C. 71, 75, 664\r\nS.E.2d 493, 496 (Ct. App. 2008). Â This standard of review does not require the\r\nappellate court to ignore the fact that the family court judge, who saw and\r\nheard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and\r\nassign comparative weight to their testimony. Â Marquez v. Caudill, 376\r\nS.C. 229, 239, 656 S.E.2d 737, 742 (2008). Â In particular, an appellate court\r\nshould be reluctant to substitute its own evaluation of the evidence on child\r\ncustody matters for that of the family court. Â Woodall v. Woodall, 322\r\nS.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996). \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn contemplating a change of\r\ncustody, the family court must examine the effect the change would have upon\r\nthe child:Â  \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe\r\nparamount and controlling consideration in a custody dispute is the best\r\ninterests of the child. Â The family court must consider the character, fitness,\r\nattitude, and inclinations on the part of each parent as they affect the child.\r\nÂ Psychological, physical, environmental, spiritual, educational, medical,\r\nfamily, emotional, and recreational aspects of the child's life should also be\r\nconsidered. Â In sum, the totality of circumstances unique to each particular\r\ncase constitutes the only scale upon which the ultimate decision can be\r\nweighed. Â \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn\r\norder for a court to grant a change in custody, the moving party must\r\ndemonstrate changed circumstances occurring subsequent to the entry of the\r\norder in question. Â A change in circumstances justifying a change in the\r\ncustody of a child simply means that sufficient facts have been shown to\r\nwarrant the conclusion that the best interests of the children would be served\r\nby the change. Â The change of circumstances relied on for a change of custody\r\nmust be such as would substantially affect the interest and welfare of the\r\nchild. Â \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSpreeuw v. Barker, 385 S.C. 45, 59-60, 682 S.E.2d 843, 850 (Ct. App.\r\n2009) (internal citations and quotes omitted); see also Moore v.\r\nMoore, 300 S.C. 75, 79-80, 386 S.E.2d 456, 458 (1989) (enunciating the\r\nfactors a family court must evaluate in making custody determination between a\r\nparent and a nonparent).Â  \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAn appellate court reviewing\r\na custody determination has authority to find facts in accordance with its own\r\nview of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Gandy v. Gandy, 297 S.C.\r\n411, 414, 377 S.E.2d 312, 314 (1989).Â  However, this scope of review does not\r\nenable the appellate court to overlook the requirements of Rule 26, SCRFC,\r\nwhich directs the family court to &quot;'set forth the specific findings of\r\nfact and conclusions of law to support the court's decision.' Â The failure of a\r\ndecree to adequately comply with Rule 26(a) constitutes reversible error.&quot;Â \r\nId. (internal citations omitted); see also Hogan v. Platts,\r\n312 S.C. 1, 4, 430 S.E.2d 510, 511 (1993) (requiring remand where family\r\ncourt's order awarding custody to child's aunt and uncle following mother's\r\ndeath omitted any finding concerning father's fitness for custody).Â  \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOur supreme court's decisions\r\nin similar matters have made it clear an appellate court does not have the\r\nauthority to substitute its own findings of fact where the family court failed\r\nto rule on whether a parent was fit to have custody.Â  See, e.g., Gandy, 297\r\nS.C. at 414, 377 S.E.2d at 314; Hogan, 312 S.C. at 4, 430 S.E.2d at\r\n511.Â  Here, the family court awarded Eison custody and Barber unsupervised\r\nvisitation but made no finding Barber was unfit to have custody of Child.Â \r\nAbsent such a determination, it would be inappropriate for this court to make\r\nits own findings of fact on this issue.Â  Rather, we are required to remand this\r\nmatter to the family court for a determination of Barber's fitness and for\r\nspecific findings of fact supporting the family court's decision.Â  \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nREMANDED.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPIEPER and GEATHERS, JJ.,\r\nand CURETON, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\nRule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-158","title":"Victor N.

Ambruoso and Rachel Ambruoso appeal the trial court's denial of their\r\nmotions for a new trial.&nbsp; They argue the court should have granted new\r\ntrial absolute due to the inadequacy of the jury's verdict or new trial\r\npursuant to the thirteenth juror doctrine.&nbsp; They also assert they were\r\nentitled to a new trial due to an error on the verdict form.&nbsp; We affirm.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOn April 12, 2004, the\r\nAmbruosos were involved in an automobile accident with Frank L. Lee, Jr.&nbsp;\r\nDr. Ambruoso was driving a 1997 Chevrolet Blazer in which Mrs. Ambruoso was a\r\npassenger.&nbsp; They were stopped to make a left turn when the truck driven by\r\nLee collided into the rear of their vehicle.&nbsp; Their Blazer was totaled as\r\na result of the accident.&nbsp; \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nImmediately after the\r\naccident, Lee left his vehicle and went to the Blazer to apologize for the\r\naccident.&nbsp; The Ambruosos exited their vehicle and began talking to\r\nLee.&nbsp; They admittedly were upset with him.&nbsp; Kenneth Bishop, who had\r\nstopped to offer assistance, asked the Ambruosos to return to their vehicle,\r\nwhich they did.&nbsp; Soon thereafter, an ambulance arrived and took them to\r\nthe hospital where they were treated and released.&nbsp; The Ambruosos were\r\nreferred to Dr. Gerald Rollins with Orthopedic Associates.&nbsp; Dr. Ambruoso\r\nwas treated by Dr. Rollins and underwent physical therapy through June 16,\r\n2004.&nbsp; Dr. Ambruoso testified that his problems were largely resolved at\r\nthat point.&nbsp; Mrs. Ambruoso was treated by Dr. Rollins and underwent\r\nphysical therapy through August 9, 2004.&nbsp; Although some of her pain\r\nresolved a few weeks after the accident, she continued to experience pain in\r\nher right hip, which had caused her problems prior to the accident.&nbsp; She\r\neventually had hip replacement surgery at Duke University Medical Center in\r\nFebruary of 2005.&nbsp; After a long recovery period, Mrs. Ambruoso's hip pain\r\nlargely subsided.&nbsp; However, due to her fear of reinjuring herself, she did\r\nnot return to her previous activities of skiing and horseback riding.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Ambruosos brought this\r\naction against Lee.&nbsp; During the trial, Lee admitted fault.&nbsp; Thus, the\r\ntrial court submitted the issue of damages alone to the jury.&nbsp; The jury\r\nreturned a verdict of $6,210.00 in actual damages for Dr. Ambruoso and\r\n$4,472.00 in actual damages for Mrs. Ambruoso.&nbsp; The Ambruosos requested\r\nten days to file their post-trial motion.&nbsp; In their written motion, they\r\nsought a new trial nisi additur and new trial absolute based on the inadequacy\r\nof the verdict and new trial pursuant to the thirteenth juror doctrine.&nbsp;\r\nThey also argued they were entitled to a new trial due to the inclusion of\r\nState Farm Insurance Company as a defendant in the caption of the verdict\r\nform.&nbsp; The trial court denied the motion.&nbsp; This appeal\r\nfollowed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;New trial absolute\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Ambruosos argue the trial\r\ncourt erred in denying their motion for a new trial absolute due to the\r\ninadequacy of the verdict.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp; \r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;The trial court has\r\nsound discretion when addressing questions of excessiveness or inadequacy of\r\nverdicts, and its decision will not be disturbed absent an abuse of\r\ndiscretion.&quot;&nbsp; Dillon v. Frazer, 383 S.C. 59, 63, 678 S.E.2d\r\n251, 253 (2009).&nbsp; The court must look at the testimony and inferences\r\nraised in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.&nbsp; Welch v.\r\nEpstein, 342 S.C. 279, 302-03, 536 S.E.2d 408, 420 (Ct. App. 2000).&nbsp;\r\nIn considering a motion for a new trial based on the inadequacy or\r\nexcessiveness of the jury's verdict, the trial court must distinguish between\r\nawards that are merely unduly liberal or conservative and awards that are\r\nactuated by passion, caprice, prejudice, or some other improper motive. &nbsp;Elam\r\nv. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 27, 602 S.E.2d 772, 781 (2004).&nbsp;\r\nThe\r\ntrial court must set aside a verdict only when it is shockingly\r\ndisproportionate to the injuries suffered.&nbsp; Welch, at 302, 536\r\nS.E.2d at 420.&nbsp; A juryâ€™s determination of damages is\r\nentitled to substantial deference.&nbsp; Knoke v. S.C. Depâ€™t. of Parks,\r\nRecreation &amp; Tourism, 324 S.C. 136, 141, 478 S.E.2d 256, 258 (1996). \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Ambruosos contend the\r\ninjuries for which they claimed damages were consistent with the impact of the\r\ncollision.&nbsp; They assert no evidence was submitted that questioned the\r\nexistence of these injuries or the initial treatment they received, which\r\nincluded the ambulance service, emergency room treatment, follow-up treatment\r\nwith Dr. Rollins, and the physical therapy ordered through his office.&nbsp;\r\nThey claim the total costs for these treatments were $3,400.00 for Dr. Ambruoso\r\nand $6,067.00 for Mrs. Ambruoso.&nbsp; The jury, however, returned a verdict of\r\n$6,210.00 in actual damages for Dr. Ambruoso and $4,472.00 in actual damages\r\nfor Mrs. Ambruoso.&nbsp; \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&quot;Even where the evidence\r\nis uncontradicted, the jury may believe all, some, or none of the testimony,\r\nand where the credibility of the witness has been questioned, the matter is\r\nproperly left to the jury to decide.&quot;&nbsp; Ross v. Paddy, 340 S.C.\r\n428, 434, 532 S.E.2d 612, 615 (Ct. App. 2000).&nbsp; &quot;The fact that\r\nevidence is not contradicted by direct evidence does not render it undisputed,\r\nas there still remains the question of its inherent probability and the\r\ncredibility of the witnesses or his interest in the result.&quot;&nbsp; Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn the present case, Lee\r\ncontested Mrs. Ambruoso's claim for damages relating to her hip problems and\r\neventual hip replacement surgery.&nbsp; Lee solicited testimony Mrs. Ambruoso\r\nhad complained of and sought treatment for hip pain prior to the\r\naccident.&nbsp; An x-ray taken on April 29, 2003 showed advanced arthritis of\r\nthe right hip.&nbsp; She then sought treatment from Dr. Lang with Duke\r\nUniversity Medical Center.&nbsp; During an examination by Dr. Lang on April 1,\r\n2004, Mrs. Ambruoso showed a decreased range of motion.&nbsp; She reported to\r\nher orthopedic surgeon in December of 2004 that while she had led an active\r\nlifestyle, starting two years earlier she had become increasingly inactive and\r\ngained weight.&nbsp; In addition, Mrs. Ambruoso took medication for arthritis,\r\npain relief, and depression in the months preceding the accident.&nbsp; \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlthough the Ambruosos are\r\nnot disputing on appeal the jury's failure to award damages for Mrs. Ambruoso's\r\ntreatment at Duke University Medical Center, they do argue they are entitled to\r\nrecover damages for the treatment from Dr. Rollins, as well as an MRI taken on\r\nJuly 20, 2004, which cost $2,195.00.&nbsp; Dr. Rollins testified that on June\r\n14, 2004, he believed Mrs. Ambruoso's complaints would be resolved in around\r\nthirty days of conservative treatment.&nbsp; He did not plan on seeing her back\r\nafter that point.&nbsp; However, Mrs. Ambruoso had returned to Dr. Rollins on\r\nAugust 9, 2004 with primary complaints of hip and back pain after having an MRI\r\ntaken on July 20, 2004.&nbsp; The MRI of her right hip showed advanced chondromalacia,\r\narthritis, and in Dr. Rollins' opinion, avascular necrosis, which is death of\r\nthe bone. &nbsp;The jury may have determined not all of the treatments claimed\r\nwere in fact related to injuries caused by the accident, but were in fact due\r\nto the pre-existing condition of her hip.&nbsp; \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Ambruosos also contend\r\nthe verdict for Dr. Ambruoso was inadequate when considering his testimony\r\nconcerning his loss of income due to the accident.&nbsp; Dr. Ambruoso claimed\r\n$2,455.20 in lost income from the appointments he cancelled at his part-time\r\nmedical practice to attend his own appointments, court, and a meeting with his\r\nattorney.&nbsp; This amount, added to the cost of his medical treatment of\r\n$3,400.00, totals $5,855.20, which is less than the jury's award of $6,210.00.&nbsp;\r\nThus, the verdict amount is not &quot;shockingly disproportionate to\r\nthe injuries suffered.&quot;&nbsp; In addition, Lee contested the amount Dr.\r\nAmbruoso claimed in lost income.&nbsp; He asserted Dr. Ambruoso could have\r\nmitigated the loss of cancelled appointments by scheduling his own appointments\r\non the days in which his part-time medical practice was not open.&nbsp; Lee\r\nalso contended Dr. Ambruoso overestimated the number of appointments that might\r\nhave been scheduled on the days he closed the practice in advance to attend his\r\nown appointments.&nbsp; Accordingly, the jury may have rejected some of Dr.\r\nAmbruoso's claims for damages for lost income.&nbsp; \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe find the jury's award of damages was\r\nwithin the evidence presented at trial.&nbsp; Accordingly, we hold the trial\r\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying the Ambruosos' motion for a new\r\ntrial absolute.&nbsp; \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thirteenth\r\nJuror Doctrine\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Ambruosos argue the trial\r\ncourt should have granted a new trial under the thirteenth juror\r\ndoctrine.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, a trial judge\r\nmay grant a new trial following a jury verdict under the thirteenth juror\r\ndoctrine. The doctrine &quot;entitles the trial judge to sit, in essence, as\r\nthe thirteenth juror when he finds 'the evidence does not justify the verdict,'\r\nand then to grant a new trial based solely 'upon the facts.'&quot;&nbsp; Norton\r\nv. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 350 S.C. 473, 478, 567 S.E.2d 851, 854 (2002)\r\n(quoting Folkens v. Hunt, 300 S.C. 251, 254, 387 S.E.2d 265, 267\r\n(1990)).&nbsp; &quot;As the 'thirteenth juror', the trial judge can hang the\r\njury by refusing to agree to the jury's otherwise unanimous\r\nverdict.&quot;&nbsp; Id.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe appellate court will\r\nuphold the trial judge's decision granting or denying a new trial unless that\r\ndecision is wholly unsupported by the evidence, or the conclusion reached was\r\ncontrolled by an error of law.&nbsp; Norton, 350 S.C. at 478, 567 S.E.2d\r\nat 854. &nbsp;Our review is limited to consideration of whether evidence exists\r\nto support the trial court's decision.&nbsp; Id. &nbsp;at 478-79, 567\r\nS.E.2d at 854.&nbsp; &quot;The 'thirteenth juror' doctrine is not used when the\r\ntrial judge has found the verdict was inadequate or unduly liberal and,\r\ntherefore, is not a vehicle to grant a new trial nisi additur.&quot;&nbsp; Bailey\r\nv. Peacock, 318 S.C. 13, 15, 455 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1995).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLee asserted the Ambruosos\r\nwere not entitled to any damages as a result of the accident.&nbsp; He was not\r\nrequired to submit evidence directly contradicting their testimony in order for\r\ntheir claims to be considered contested.&nbsp; As stated above, the trial\r\ncourt's decision to allow the jury's verdict to stand was supported by the\r\nevidence in the record.&nbsp; Accordingly, we find no error in the trial\r\ncourt's denial of the Ambruosos' motion for a new trial pursuant to the\r\nthirteenth juror doctrine.&nbsp; \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Verdict Form\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Ambruosos argue they are\r\nentitled to a new trial because the verdict form impermissibly included\r\nevidence of liability insurance.&nbsp; The verdict form listed State Farm\r\nMutual Automotive Insurance as a defendant.&nbsp; Although this form was\r\nprovided to the attorneys prior to its submission to the jury, the Ambruosos\r\ndid not object to it at that time.&nbsp; After the jury returned its verdict,\r\nthe court noticed the inclusion of State Farm as a defendant.&nbsp; The\r\nAmbruosos did not complain about the inclusion of State Farm in the caption of\r\nthe verdict form until their post-trial motion.&nbsp; The trial court held the\r\nAmbruosos had waived any objection by failing to object earlier.&nbsp; As the\r\ntrial court noted, all of the parties had an opportunity to review and approve\r\nthe verdict form before it was submitted to the jury.&nbsp; We find the trial\r\ncourt did not err in holding the Ambruosos waived their objection to the\r\nverdict form.&nbsp; See Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 304, 486\r\nS.E.2d 750, 757 (1997) (finding appellant waived claim of lack of notice of\r\ncause of action by failing to object to having his name included on the verdict\r\nform); Johnson v. Hoechst Celanese Corp., 317 S.C. 415, 421, 453 S.E.2d\r\n908, 912 (Ct. App. 1995) (holding by failing to object to a verdict form until\r\nafter a liability verdict had been reached, appellant failed to preserve any\r\nissue relating to the verdict form).&nbsp; \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn addition, we find the\r\ntrial court cured any error with an instruction given the jury.&nbsp; During\r\ndeliberations, the jury sent a note to the court asking: &nbsp;&quot;Does\r\ninsurance affect the settlement?&nbsp; If it does, what percentage of the bills\r\nwill be paid by insurance[?]&quot;&nbsp; The court responded: &nbsp;&quot;It\r\ndoes not affect your verdict.&nbsp; It is not to be considered or\r\ndiscussed.&quot;&nbsp; Although the court was not aware of the inclusion of\r\nState Farm in the caption of the verdict form at the time, its response to the\r\njury's question adequately addressed the issue.&nbsp; &quot;Generally, a\r\ncurative instruction is deemed to have cured any alleged error.&quot;&nbsp; State\r\nv. Walker, 366 S.C. 643, 658, 623 S.E.2d 122, 129 (Ct. App. 2005).&nbsp;\r\n&quot;A curative instruction to disregard incompetent evidence and not to\r\nconsider it during deliberation is deemed to have cured any alleged error in\r\nits admission.&quot; &nbsp;Id. at 658, 623 S.E.2d at 130.&nbsp;\r\nAccordingly, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying\r\nthe Ambruosos' motion for new trial on this issue.&nbsp; \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor the above\r\nstated reasons, the decision of the trial court is \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHUFF,\r\nWILLIAMS, and GEATHERS, JJ. concur.&nbsp; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-159","title":"State v.

Washington was convicted of murder and was\r\n  sentenced to thirty years imprisonment.Â  He appeals asserting the trial court\r\n  erred in failing to: Â (1) grant a mistrial, (2) direct a verdict in his favor,\r\n  and (3) &quot;require the State to elect a theory of the case based on the\r\n  indictments.&quot;Â  Washington also asserts error in the trial court's jury\r\n  charge on &quot;the hand of one is the hand of all&quot; and its charge concerning\r\n  malice. Â We affirm pursuant\r\n  to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and\r\n  the following authorities:Â  State v.\r\n    Council, 335 S.C. 1, 12-13, 515\r\n  S.E.2d 508, 514 (1999) (holding the decision to grant or deny a mistrial is\r\n  within the sound discretion of the trial judge, whose ruling will not be\r\n  overturned on appeal absent an abuse of discretion; a mistrial should not be\r\n  granted unless absolutely necessary); State v. Ward, 374 S.C. 606,\r\n  612-13, 649 S.E.2d 145, 148 (Ct. App. 2007) (holding, in appeal from Washington's\r\n  co-defendant Ward who was tried with Washington, isolated gang references that\r\n  were not completely gratuitous did not warrant a mistrial); State v. Padgett,\r\n  354 S.C. 268, 270-271, 580 S.E.2d 159, 161 (Ct. App. 2003) (on appeal from the\r\n  denial of a directed verdict, an appellate court must view the evidence in the\r\n  light most favorable to the State; if there is any direct evidence or any\r\n  substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of\r\n  the accused, the appellate court must find the case was properly submitted to\r\n  the jury); Ward, 374 S.C. at 615, 649 S.E.2d at 150 (noting the\r\n  following evidence presented to support the trial court's denial of directed\r\n  verdict: Â that Washington and Ward were involved in the fight with Dunmeyer;\r\n  that as Dunmeyer fled, Washington threatened to kill someone that night; and\r\n  that moments after that threat, Ward and Washington got into a truck from which\r\n  gunfire erupted towards the vehicle in which Dunmeyer rode); State v.\r\n    Serrette, 375 S.C. 650, 652, 654 S.E.2d 554, 555 (Ct.

Brown,\r\n  362 S.C. 258, 261-62, 607 S.E.2d 93, 95 (Ct.

Craft, 372 S.C.\r\n  1, 20, 640 S.E.2d 486, 497 (Ct. App. 2006) (noting an issue raised on appeal\r\n  but not argued in the brief is deemed abandoned and will not be considered by\r\n  the appellate court); Mulherin-Howell v. Cobb, 362 S.C. 588, 600, 608\r\n  S.E.2d 587, 593-94 (Ct.

Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (holding\r\n  an issue is abandoned where the appellant fails to provide argument or\r\n  supporting authority); Rule 208(b)(1)(D), SCACR (providing that an appellant's\r\n  brief &quot;shall be divided into as many parts as there are issues to be argued,&quot;\r\n  and &quot;[a]t the head of each part, the particular issue to be addressed\r\n  shall be set forth in distinctive type, followed by discussion and citations of\r\n  authority&quot;).[1]\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, THOMAS,\r\n  and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-163","title":"M.
