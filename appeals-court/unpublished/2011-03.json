Fred Kuhn, Jr., of Beaufort, for\r\n          Appellant.\r\n        William J. Delozier, pro se, of\r\n          Simpsonville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Mary\r\n  Joan Delozier (Wife) appeals a family court order modifying a divorce decree\r\n  entered between her and William J. Delozier (Husband).Â  Wife argues the family\r\n  court erred in (1) calculating her award of retroactive child support and (2)\r\n  denying her attorney's fees and costs.Â  Â We affirm as modified.[1]\r\nI. Â Retroactive\r\n  Child Support\r\nWife contends the family court erred in calculating the total amount\r\n  of her retroactive child support.Â  We agree and modify the order to reflect the correct total.\r\n&quot;The decision to award retroactive child\r\n  support rests in the sound discretion of the family court.&quot;Â  Engle v. Engle,\r\n  343 S.C. 444, 453, 539 S.E.2d 712, 716&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000).Â  &quot;[A]bsent an abuse of discretion,\r\n  [that decision] will not be disturbed on appeal.Â \r\n  An abuse of discretion occurs when the court['s\r\n  decision] is controlled by some error of law or where\r\n  the order, based upon the findings of fact, is without evidentiary\r\n  support.&quot;Â  Id. at 448-49, 539 S.E.2d at 714.Â  \r\nHere, the family court's\r\n  calculation of monthly, retroactive child support had evidentiary support.Â  The\r\n  family court found Wife's monthly income constituted $3,500 from alimony and\r\n  $975 from employment.Â  Moreover, the family court found Husband's income\r\n  was $7,000 per month and granted Husband a credit of $285 per month for health\r\n  insurance he paid for his minor children.Â  The child support worksheet used\r\n  these figures, and both the worksheet and the final order showed Wife was\r\n  entitled to child support of $242 per month.Â  Therefore, the family court's\r\n  order properly granted Wife monthly, retroactive child support of $242. \r\nAlthough the family court properly\r\n  granted the figure for monthly, retroactive child support, the family court\r\n  erred in calculating the total amount of Wife's retroactive child support.Â  The\r\n  family court granted retroactive support from June 26, 2006, through December 7,\r\n  2007, and it found the total retroactive support owed was $1,452.Â  However, the\r\n  length of that period and the $242 figure granted for monthly, retroactive\r\n  support show the total grant of $1,452 resulted from a mathematical\r\n  miscalculation.Â  Therefore, the family court's grant of total, retroactive\r\n  support was without evidentiary support, and using the monthly figure of $242, Wife\r\n  was entitled to a total amount of $4,356.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the family\r\n  court's award of retroactive child support but modify the order to grant the\r\n  correct total amount of retroactive child supportâ€”$4,356.\r\nII. Attorney's\r\n  Fees\r\nWife argues the family court\r\n  abused its discretion in denying her request for attorney's fees and costs\r\n  because the family court (1) erroneously applied Rule\r\n  1.5, RPC, Rule 407, SCACR, and Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403\r\n  S.E.2d 313 (1991), in deciding whether to grant attorney's fees and costs and\r\n  (2) did not provide sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law under\r\n  Rule 26(a), SCRFC.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n&quot;The family\r\n  court has discretion in deciding whether to award attorney's fees, and its decision\r\n  will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion.Â  An abuse of discretion\r\n  occurs when the decision is controlled by an error of law .&nbsp;. .&nbsp;.&quot;Â  Feldman v. Feldman, 380 S.C. 538, 546, 670 S.E.2d 669, 673 (Ct. App.\r\n  2008).Â  Whether a family court should grant\r\n  attorney's fees depends upon four factors: &quot;(1) the party's ability to pay\r\n  his/her own attorney's fee; (2) beneficial results obtained by the attorney;\r\n  (3) the parties' respective financial conditions; [and] (4) [the] effect of the\r\n  attorney's fee on each party's standard of living.&quot;Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M.,\r\n  307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  \r\nHere, the family court's citation of Glasscock and\r\n  Rule 1.5 did not reflect a use of the incorrect legal standard because the court's\r\n  order listed the four factors from E.D.M. for whether to grant\r\n  attorney's fees and costs.Â  Moreover, the family court made sufficient findings\r\n  in denying Wife attorney's fees and costs.Â  The family court found the parties obtained\r\n  beneficial results from their attorneys and could pay their attorney's fees and\r\n  costs.Â  Even if those findings were insufficient by themselves, considering the\r\n  order in its entirety we find the family court's decision was sufficiently based\r\n  upon all of the E.D.M. factors, including the parties' financial\r\n  conditions and standards of living.Â  Therefore, the family court did not abuse\r\n  its discretion in denying Wife's request for attorney's fees and costs.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  GEATHERS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-086","title":"Douglas v.

David, as the sole owner of Island Refuge, Inc., a partner of\r\n  Martins Point Limited Partnership (the LP), brought suit against Appellant, as\r\n  well as the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control\r\n  (DHEC), to enforce a deed restriction prohibiting the construction of a dock\r\n  and permanently enjoining the same (the Covenant Case).Â  Shortly thereafter,\r\n  the Lowcountry Open Land Trust, Inc., (Lowcountry) filed a separate action\r\n  against Appellant, seeking specific performance of an alleged conservation\r\n  easement (hereinafter the Conservation Easement Case). Â The trial court\r\n  granted a motion to consolidate the cases, as well as DHEC's motion for Summary\r\n  Judgment, which dismissed DHEC from the case.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  the trial court heard the matter, but before it issued a ruling, Appellant\r\n  settled the Conservation Easement Case with Lowcountry.Â Â  On July 22, 2008, the\r\n  trial court signed an order dismissing the Conservation Easement Case. Â On\r\n  August 4, the trial court entered an order finding in favor of the LP on the\r\n  Covenant Case; however, because the order was prepared by the LP prior to the\r\n  settlement, it contained findings and conclusions relating to the Conservation\r\n  Easement Case.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  August 25, Appellant filed a Motion to Reconsider, Alter or Amend, and in\r\n  response, the trial court amended the August 4 order &quot;insofar as it makes\r\n  legal conclusions which affect the Conservation Easement [Case] which was\r\n  originally part . . . [of this case, but] was dismissed by agreement of those\r\n  parties while I had the matter under advisement after trial.&quot; \r\nFACTS\r\nIn\r\n  1989, the LP purchased 1,000 acres of property on Wadmalaw Island, which\r\n  included both marsh and river-front property, to be subdivided for the purpose\r\n  of developing a neighborhood.Â  There were initially six members of the LP, each\r\n  being required to simultaneously purchase a lot in the subdivision when the LP\r\n  closed on the larger 1,000-acre plot.Â  Of the thirty-two lots, eight have deep-water\r\n  frontage and each of these eight lots now have a private dock. \r\nWhen\r\n  the LP initially began the development of Martins Point, the goal of the\r\n  development was to preserve and protect the ecologically valuable area and to design\r\n  and develop it in a low-impact, ecologically friendly manner.Â  The LP's\r\n  Placement Memorandum states:Â  &quot;MARTINS POINT LP IS NOT A CONVENTIONAL\r\n  DEVELOPMENT.Â  THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO PROVIDE THE PARTNERS AN OPPORTUNITY\r\n  TO OWN PRIME WATERFRONT PROPERTY IN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SIGNIFICANT LOCATION.Â \r\n  THE PARTNERSHIP IS NOT COMMITTED TO MAXIMIZING RETURN ON INVESTMENT.&quot;\r\nThe\r\n  LP currently retains ownership of three lots in the subdivision, as well as the\r\n  title to Martins Point Road; however, in August, 1991, the LP deeded to\r\n  Appellant the common areas, consisting of roughly fifty acres, including the\r\n  .725-acre parcel on which the boat ramp and landing area in question is\r\n  located.Â  The 1991 deed contained the following restriction: &quot;No dock\r\n  shall be constructed as an appurtenance to [the] Common Area containing .725\r\n  acres.&quot; \r\nIn\r\n  2001, a number of new property owners began discussing the possibility of\r\n  constructing a boarding dock at the boat ramp.Â  In 2005, Appellant sought and\r\n  received a permit from DHEC authorizing the construction of ninety-foot long\r\n  fixed pier, ramp, and floating dock.Â  That same year the respondents brought\r\n  the present action seeking to permanently enjoin the construction of the dock.Â \r\n  The trial court found the deed restriction enforceable and enjoined\r\n  construction of the dock.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â  \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n1. Did the trial court\r\n  err in making mention of the Conservation Easement Case in its order?\r\n2. Did the trial\r\n  court err in enforcing the deed restriction?\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nAn\r\n  action for an injunction is equitable.Â  Doe v. S.C. Med. Malpractice Liab.\r\n  Joint Underwriting Ass'n, 347 S.C. 642, 645, 557 S.E.2d 670, 672 (2001).Â \r\n  An action to enforce a restrictive covenant is one in equity.Â  S.C. Dep't of\r\n  Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 622, 550 S.E.2d 299,\r\n  302 (2001).Â  In actions at equity, this court may find facts based on its own\r\n  view of the evidence.Â  Ex parte Gregory, 378 S.C. 430, 436-37, 663\r\n  S.E.2d 46, 50 (2008).Â  However, while this is a broad standard, this court will\r\n  not disregard the findings of the trial court.Â  Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro,\r\n  Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 237, 391 S.E.2d 538, 543 (1989).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.\r\n  Appellant argues the trial court erred in mentioning the conservation easement\r\n  case, specifically, in failing to vacate its findings of facts.Â  We disagree.Â \r\n  Generally, &quot;[w]here an action has been dismissed with prejudice, the\r\n  judgment operates in subsequent litigation to the same extent as if the action\r\n  had been tried to a final adjudication.&quot;Â  Jones v. City of Folly Beach,\r\n  326 S.C. 360, 366, 483 S.E.2d 770, 773 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  In this case the trial\r\n  court vacated its conclusions of law concerning the conservation easement case,\r\n  and although not explicitly vacating its findings of facts for that case, we\r\n  find the trial court did not rely on those facts in making its decision on the\r\n  deed restriction case.Â  Accordingly, Appellant was not prejudiced.\r\n2.\r\n  Although Appellant concedes the deed in question contains an express\r\n  prohibition against the construction of a dock, Appellant argues the trial\r\n  court erred in enforcing the deed restriction.Â  In this regard, Appellant\r\n  maintains that neither the LP nor David has standing to enforce the restriction,\r\n  and further, that the restriction is unenforceable because there is no\r\n  substantial benefit served by its enforcement.Â  Appellant also argues the\r\n  circumstances have so changed since the conveyance that enforcement of the\r\n  restriction is unreasonable and oppressive.Â  Generally, a grantor may enforce a\r\n  restriction against a grantee when the grantor owns land that stands to benefit\r\n  from the restriction's enforcement.Â  McLeod v. Baptiste, 315 S.C. 246,\r\n  247, 433 S.E.2d 834, 835 (1993).Â  Here, in limiting the number of docks and the\r\n  flow of boat, passenger, and automobile traffic on the waterfront site, the LP's\r\n  interest of minimizing environmental impact is served; therefore, the LP has\r\n  standing to enforce the restriction.[1]Â \r\n  Likewise, because the restriction serves the stated purpose of the LP's\r\n  development strategy, the clear restriction is not unenforceable for lack of\r\n  serving a substantial purpose.Â  See generally Vickery v. Powell,\r\n  267 S.C. 23, 28, 225 S.E.2d 856, 859 (1976) (indicating that a deed restriction\r\n  against mobile homes served no substantial purpose when only a few lots within\r\n  a larger subdivision â€“ where mobile homes were common â€“ were encumbered, and\r\n  nothing restricted permanent homes which resembled mobile homes).Â  Finally,\r\n  although a number of private docks have been constructed since the 1991 deed\r\n  conveying the common lot, it was never contemplated that such docks would not\r\n  be permitted in Martins Point; thus, conditions have not changed to a degree\r\n  significant enough to warrant ignoring the express deed restriction. See Menne v. Keowee Key Prop. Owner's Ass'n Inc., 368 S.C. 557, 564, 629 S.E.2d 690, 694 (Ct. App. 2007)\r\n  (stating that a party seeking such nullification &quot;must show the change of\r\n  conditions represented so radical a change that the original purpose of the\r\n  restrictive covenant can no longer be realized&quot;).Â Accordingly, we\r\n  affirm.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the reasons stated above, the ruling of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT,\r\n  THOMAS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because the LP\r\n  has standing to enforce the restriction, we need not address whether David\r\n  personally has the same, nor need we address whether a negative reciprocal\r\n  covenant arose by implication. Â Furthermore, contrary to Appellant's position,\r\n  we are aware of no authority which mandates that the benefit of the deed\r\n  restriction to the party seeking to enforce it be measured exclusively in\r\n  economic terms.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-087","title":"State v.

Pachak, of Columbia, for\r\n          Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Alan M. Wilson, Chief\r\n          Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General\r\n          Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Julie M. Thames, Office of the\r\n          Attorney General, of Columbia; Robert Mills of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  John Barbare appeals his conviction for armed\r\n  robbery.Â  On appeal, Barbare argues the trial court erred (1) by allowing an\r\n  officer to testify to the contents of a surveillance video that was no longer\r\n  available; and (2) by improperly shifting the burden of proof during its jury\r\n  instruction.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  February 16, 2008, a robbery occurred at the Spinx convenience store in\r\n  Marietta, South Carolina.Â  Barbare was subsequently arrested and indicted for\r\n  armed robbery. \r\nAt\r\n  trial, Barbare made a motion to exclude any testimony related to the contents\r\n  of the surveillance video on the ground that the State failed to produce the\r\n  video.Â  According to Barbare, this failure constituted a violation of Rule 5 of\r\n  the South Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure because the surveillance video contained\r\n  exculpatory evidence.Â  The State argued the surveillance video did not contain\r\n  any exculpatory evidence based on the ruling of a circuit court judge.Â  The\r\n  State also argued it should be permitted to discuss the contents of the\r\n  surveillance video if Barbare opened the door to this issue.Â  The trial court\r\n  did not review the prior judge's ruling regarding the exculpatory nature of the\r\n  surveillance video and granted the State's request to discuss the surveillance\r\n  video contents if Barbare made any references concerning the availability of\r\n  the surveillance video.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State called several witnesses during its case in chief.Â  Hoyt Rash, the\r\n  store clerk, testified that Barbare, a regular customer of the store,\r\n  approached the counter and asked for two packs of cigarettes.Â  Rash indicated\r\n  Barbare pointed a gun at him and stole approximately $140 from the store.\r\nCheryl\r\n  Shipman, a store customer, testified she heard Barbare tell Rash that he was\r\n  going to shoot Rash if Rash did not open the cash register.Â  After hearing this\r\n  statement, Shipman hid behind an aisle and heard Barbare arguing with another store\r\n  customer.Â  Shipman exited the store and called 911.Â  \r\nOfficer\r\n  Brian Osborne of the Greenville County Sheriff's Office (Sheriff's Office)\r\n  reported to the store after the robbery and subsequently conducted a photo\r\n  lineup at the Sheriff's office.Â  Officer Osborne testified Rash identified\r\n  Barbare as the perpetrator of the armed robbery.Â  Officer Osborne stated Barbare\r\n  was arrested, waived his Miranda rights, and produced a written\r\n  confession implicating his involvement in the armed robbery.Â  Officer Matthew\r\n  Owens testified Barbare was coherent and did not appear to be intoxicated or\r\n  under the influence of drugs during his confession.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  cross-examination, Officer Owens answered several questions posed by Barbare\r\n  regarding the surveillance video.Â  In response, the State recalled Officer\r\n  Osborne to the witness stand to discuss the contents of the surveillance video.Â \r\n  Barbare objected and argued Officer Osborne's testimony violated his Sixth Amendment\r\n  right to confront a witness because the State failed to produce the\r\n  surveillance video.Â  The trial court overruled Barbare's objection and allowed\r\n  Officer Osborne to testify to the contents of the surveillance video. \r\nAfter\r\n  the State's presentation of the evidence, Barbare testified in his own defense.Â \r\n  Barbare stated he went to the store to purchase cigarettes and beer.Â  While in\r\n  the store, Barbare stated an intoxicated customer bumped into him and a verbal\r\n  altercation ensued.Â  After this incident, Barbare testified he became scared\r\n  and upset and did not purchase any items from the store.Â  Barbare also claimed he\r\n  did not rob the store or confess to the robbery.\r\nThe\r\n  jury subsequently convicted Barbare for armed robbery, and the trial court sentenced\r\n  him to twenty years imprisonment.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the\r\n  appellate court sits to review errors of law only. State\r\n    v. Martucci, 380 S.C. 232, 246, 669 S.E.2d 598, 605-06 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  This court is\r\n  bound by the trial court's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. State\r\n    v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220&nbsp;(2006).Â  This court\r\n  does not reevaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence but simply determines whether the trial court's ruling is supported by\r\n  any evidence.Â  State v. Moore, 374 S.C. 468, 473-74, 649 S.E.2d 84, 86\r\n  (Ct. App. 2007).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA. Violation of the Confrontation\r\n  Clause\r\nBarbare argues Officer\r\n  Osborne's testimony regarding the contents of the store's surveillance video\r\n  violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront a witness.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Confrontation Clause of\r\n  the Sixth Amendment, which was extended to the states by the Fourteenth\r\n  Amendment, guarantees the right of a criminal defendant to confront witnesses\r\n  against him, and this includes the right to cross-examine witnesses.Â  State\r\n    v. Holder, 382 S.C. 278, 283, 676 S.E.2d 690, 693&nbsp;(2009).Â  \r\nDuring cross-examination, Barbare\r\n  asked Officer Owens several questions about the surveillance videotape. The\r\n  colloquy between Barbare and Officer Owens provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  Defense\r\n    Counsel:Â  You were aware that the Spinx station had a functioning video\r\n    surveillance system?\r\n    Officer\r\n    Owens:Â  From -- yeah.\r\n    Defense\r\n    Counsel:Â  And that it was working that night?\r\n    Officer\r\n    Owens:Â  It could have been.Â  I don't know.\r\n    Defense\r\n    Counsel:Â  And could have been viewed?\r\n    Officer\r\n    Owens:Â  Yeah.\r\n    Defense\r\n    Counsel:Â  People had viewed the video?\r\n    Officer\r\n    Owens:Â  Did I view the video?\r\n    Defense\r\n    Counsel:Â  No.Â  Other officers viewed the video?\r\n    Officer\r\n    Owens:Â  I â€“ yeah.\r\n    Defense\r\n    Counsel:Â  No video was ever obtained?\r\n    Officer\r\n    Owens:Â  Not from me.\r\n    Defense\r\n    Counsel:Â  It's not in evidence?\r\n    Officer\r\n    Owens:Â  Okay.\r\n    Defense\r\n    Counsel:Â  It's not put into evidence in P&amp;E?\r\n    Officer\r\n    Owens:Â  I didn't put any video in P&amp;E.\r\n\r\nAfter Barbare's cross-examination\r\n  of Officer Owens, the State recalled Officer Osborne to testify to the contents\r\n  of the surveillance video.Â  Once Barbare questioned Officer Owens about the\r\n  store's surveillance video, Barbare opened the door to this issue.Â  We conclude\r\n  the State was permitted to recall Officer Osborne to the witness stand to rebut\r\n  Barbare's cross-examination of Officer Owens' testimony regarding the store's\r\n  surveillance video.Â  Thus, we discern no error from the trial court's decision in\r\n  allowing Officer Osborne to testify to the contents of the videotape.Â  See State v. Stroman,&nbsp;281 S.C. 508, 513, 316 S.E.2d 395, 399&nbsp;(1984)\r\n  (stating &quot;where one party introduces evidence as to a particular fact or\r\n  transaction, the other party is entitled to introduce evidence in explanation\r\n  or rebuttal thereof, even though [the] latter evidence would be incompetent or\r\n  irrelevant had it been offered initially&quot;). \r\nB.&nbsp; Jury Instruction\r\nBarbare also argues the trial\r\n  court's jury instruction violated his right to due process because the trial\r\n  court improperly shifted the burden of proof.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe law to be charged to the\r\n  jury must be determined by the evidence presented at trial.Â  State v.\r\n    Patterson, 367 S.C. 219, 231, 625 S.E.2d 239, 245 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  A trial\r\n  court is required to charge only the current and correct law of this state.Â  Id.Â \r\n  A jury charge is correct if it contains the correct definition of the law when\r\n  read as a whole.Â  Id. at 232, 625 S.E.2d at 245.Â  Jury\r\n  instructions must be considered as a whole, and if as a whole they are free\r\n  from error, any isolated portions which might be misleading do not constitute\r\n  reversible error.Â  State v. Smith, 315 S.C. 547, 554, 446 S.E.2d 411,\r\n  415 (1994).Â  \r\nDuring the jury\r\n  charge, the trial court stated,\r\n\r\n  Ladies\r\n    and gentlemen, I charge you that the State does not have an absolute duty to\r\n    preserve potentially useful evidence that might exonerate a defendant.Â  To\r\n    establish a due process violation, a defendant must demonstrate, first of all,\r\n    that the State destroyed the evidence in bad faith.Â  And, secondly, that the\r\n    evidence possessed an exculpatory value apparent before the evidence was destroyed,\r\n    and that the [d]efendant cannot obtain other evidence of comparable value by\r\n    other means.Â  \r\n\r\nBarbare objected to this\r\n  portion of the jury instruction and argued the charge suggested &quot;a\r\n  burden-shifting message.&quot;Â  The trial court's statement that the State does\r\n  not have an absolute duty to preserve potentially useful evidence that might\r\n  exonerate a defendant is a correct pronouncement of the law.Â  See State\r\n    v. Breeze, 379 S.C. 538, 545, 665 S.E.2d 247, 251&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2008)\r\n  (stating the State does not have an absolute duty to safeguard potentially\r\n  useful evidence that might vindicate a defendant and that a defendant must\r\n  demonstrate (1) that the State destroyed the evidence in bad faith, or (2) that\r\n  the evidence possessed an exculpatory value apparent before the evidence was\r\n  destroyed and the defendant cannot obtain other evidence of comparable value by\r\n  other means to support a due process claim).Â  Therefore, we conclude the trial\r\n  court's jury instruction was free from error.Â  \r\n\r\n  CONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the trial\r\n  court's decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J., SHORT and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-088","title":"SCDSS v.

Burton, of Spartanburg,\r\n          for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Brenda\r\n  and Stephen Densmore (Appellants) appeal from the trial court's order granting\r\n  partial summary judgment to the City of Greenville, Greenville Technical\r\n  College, Warren Gilliard, K.M. Cox, and other John Doe Actors (collectively, Respondents)\r\n  and the jury's verdict in favor of Respondents.Â  We affirm the trial court's\r\n  orders granting summary judgment to Respondents and the trial court's rulings\r\n  during the trial of Appellants' cause of action for assault and battery.[1]\r\n1.Â  We find the trial court properly granted summary judgment to Respondents on the causes\r\n  of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, malicious\r\n  prosecution, defamation, false imprisonment, conspiracy, negligence, and loss\r\n  of consortium.Â  The trial court properly granted summary judgment to Respondents\r\n  on the cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress because\r\n  the South Carolina Tort Claims Act specifically excludes the cause of action.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-30(f) (2005).Â  The trial court correctly found\r\n  Respondents were entitled to summary judgment on the cause of action for\r\n  malicious prosecution because Appellants conceded the nolle prosequi precluded their malicious prosecution claim at the hearing on the\r\n  motions for summary judgment.Â  Respondents were also entitled to summary\r\n  judgment on the cause of action for defamation because the only evidence Appellants\r\n  presented was an official police report explaining the circumstances resulting\r\n  in the charge, and the report was privileged.[2]Â  See Murray v. Holnam, Inc., 344 S.C. 129, 140-41, 542 S.E.2d 743,\r\n  749 (Ct. App. 2001) (&quot;A communication made in good faith on any subject\r\n  matter in which the person communicating has an interest or duty is qualifiedly\r\n  privileged if made to a person with a corresponding interest or duty even\r\n  though it contains matter which, without this privilege, would be actionable.&quot;); Cullum v. Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc., 228 S.C. 384, 388-89, 90 S.E.2d\r\n  370, 372 (1955) (&quot;A communication thus qualifiedly privileged is not\r\n  actionable, even though it contain[s] a charge of crime, unless malice in fact\r\n  be shown&quot; and defining malice in fact as when a person acts by ill will in\r\n  what he does and says, &quot;with the design to causelessly and wantonly injure&quot;\r\n  another person).Â  As to the cause of action for false imprisonment, the trial court\r\n  properly found Respondents were entitled to summary judgment because Brenda\r\n  admitted her guilt in her plea agreement, making the arrest lawful.Â  See McBride v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville Cnty., 389 S.C. 546, 567, 698 S.E.2d\r\n  845, 856 (Ct. App. 2010) (&quot;To prevail on a claim for false imprisonment,\r\n  the plaintiff must establish: (1) the defendant restrained the plaintiff, (2)\r\n  the restraint was intentional, and (3) the restraint was unlawful.&quot;).[3]Â \r\n  The trial court correctly found Respondents were entitled to summary judgment\r\n  on the cause of action for conspiracy because there was no evidence that two or\r\n  more persons joined for the purpose of injuring or causing special damage to Brenda.Â  See Cricket Cove Ventures, LLC v. Gilland, 390 S.C. 312, 324, 701\r\n  S.E.2d 39, 46 (Ct. App. 2010)Â  (stating civil conspiracy consists of three\r\n  elements: (1) a combination of two or more persons, (2) joining for the purpose\r\n  of injuring the plaintiff, (3) which causes him special damage);Â  Pye v.\r\n    Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 567, 633 S.E.2d 505, 511 (2006) (holding that to\r\n  establish a conspiracy, the plaintiff must produce evidence, direct or\r\n  circumstantial, from which a party may reasonably infer the joint assent of the\r\n  minds of two or more parties to the prosecution of the enterprise).Â  The trial\r\n  court appropriately determined Respondents were entitled to summary judgment on\r\n  the cause of action for negligence because there was no evidence that any\r\n  Greenville Tech employee had possession of or used a Taser in this case, and Appellants\r\n  conceded at the hearing that the negligent entrustment issue did not apply to\r\n  Greenville Tech or its employees.Â  Additionally, there was no evidence that\r\n  Officer Cox improperly used the Taser or the City was negligent in its\r\n  entrustment of the Taser to him.Â  See Nelson v. Piggly Wiggly\r\n    Central, Inc., 390 S.C. 382, 391, 701 S.E.2d 776, 780 (Ct. App. 2010)\r\n  (finding to establish a cause of action in negligence, a plaintiff must prove:\r\n  &quot;(1) the defendants owed her a duty of care; (2) the defendants breached\r\n  that duty by a negligent act or omission; and (3) she suffered damage as a proximate\r\n  result of that breach&quot;).Â  Finally, the court properly dismissed Stephen's\r\n  claims for loss of consortium as defective because it found they were derived\r\n  from Brenda's claims.Â  Because we find the court properly granted summary\r\n  judgment on all of Brenda's causes of action except for assault and battery, we\r\n  find the court was also correct in dismissing Stephen's claims.Â  \r\n2.Â  We find the trial court properly determined\r\n  Appellants had a full and fair opportunity to engage in discovery before\r\n  granting the motions for summary judgment.Â  In Appellants' motion in\r\n  opposition to Respondents' motion for summary judgment and during the hearing,\r\n  Appellants requested ninety days to complete discovery under Rule 56(f), SCRCP,\r\n  because the depositions of the individual officers were scheduled for\r\n  mid-April.[4]Â  The trial court found Appellants had\r\n  adequate time to participate in discovery, noting Appellants filed the case\r\n  nearly eleven months prior to the hearing.Â  Appellants had not: (1) provided a good reason why eleven months\r\n  was insufficient time under the facts of this case to develop documentation in\r\n  opposition to Respondents' motions for summary judgment; (2) filed any\r\n  affidavits explaining why they needed more time for discovery; (3) demonstrated\r\n  a likelihood that further discovery would uncover additional evidence relevant\r\n  to their causes of action; (4) served any discovery requests on Respondents at\r\n  the time of the hearing; (5) filed a motion for continuance; or (6) shown they\r\n  were not dilatory in seeking discovery.Â  In fact, Respondent Greenville Tech's\r\n  motions to compel Appellants to respond to discovery requests demonstrate\r\n  Appellants were dilatory.Â  See Baughman v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co.,\r\n  306 S.C. 101, 112, 410 S.E.2d 537, 543 (1991) (&quot;[S]ummary judgment must\r\n  not be granted until the opposing party has had a full and fair opportunity to\r\n  complete discovery.&quot;); Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580\r\n  S.E.2d 433, 439 (2003) (citations omitted) (finding the nonmoving party must\r\n  demonstrate it is not merely engaged in a 'fishing expedition' by showing the\r\n  likelihood that further discovery will uncover additional relevant evidence); Guinan\r\n    v. Tenet Healthsystems of Hilton Head, Inc., 383 S.C. 48, 54-55, 677 S.E.2d\r\n  32, 36 (Ct. App. 2009) (&quot;A party claiming summary judgment is premature\r\n  because they have not been provided a full and fair opportunity to conduct\r\n  discovery must advance a good reason why the time was insufficient under the\r\n  facts of the case, and why further discovery would uncover additional relevant\r\n  evidence and create a genuine issue of material fact.&quot;); Rule 56(f), SCRCP\r\n  (&quot;Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that\r\n  he cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify\r\n  his opposition . . . the court . . . may order a continuance to permit . . .\r\n  discovery to be had . . . .&quot;);Â  Doe v. Batson, 345 S.C. 316, 321,\r\n  548 S.E.2d 854, 857 (2001) (&quot;Thus, Rule 56(f) requires the party opposing\r\n  summary judgment to at least present affidavits explaining why he needs more\r\n  time for discovery.&quot;); but see Baughman, 306 S.C. at 112 n.4,\r\n  410 S.E.2d at 544 n.4 (noting that although the plaintiff did not file an\r\n  affidavit invoking Rule 56(f), other courts have not mandated strict compliance\r\n  with the technical requirements of Rule 56(f) where the need for further\r\n  discovery is otherwise made known to the trial court).\r\n3. We find the trial court's denial of Appellants' motion in limine is not\r\n  preserved.Â  Appellants filed a motion in limine pursuant to Rules 402 and 403,\r\n  SCRE, seeking to exclude the testimony of several witnesses about Brenda's\r\n  behavior inside the building because Appellants asserted the officers testified\r\n  they had no knowledge of the acts that occurred inside the building at the time\r\n  they detained and arrested Brenda.Â  However, Appellants did not\r\n  contemporaneously object to the testimony when it was introduced at trial; therefore,\r\n  this issue is not properly preserved for our review.[5]Â  See Parr v. Gaines, 309 S.C. 477, 481, 424 S.E.2d 515, 518 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1992) (holding motions in limine are not final determinations of whether\r\n  evidence will be admitted at trial, and if a motion in limine to exclude\r\n  evidence is denied, a party must renew its objection when the evidence is\r\n  presented during trial).Â Â  \r\n4.Â  We find the trial court properly\r\n  excluded the testimony of Appellants' expert.Â  Respondents filed motions in limine seeking to exclude the\r\n  testimony of an expert witness whom Appellants intended to testify as to the\r\n  standard of care Officer Cox should have used because Appellants did not\r\n  identify the expert witness until August 22, 2008, and the trial was set for\r\n  the week of September 8 or 15, 2008.Â  On appeal, Appellants argue the court\r\n  failed to conduct the analysis required under Jumper v. Hawkins, 348\r\n  S.C. 142, 558 S.E.2d 911 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  We find the trial court properly\r\n  considered all the Jumper factors in making its decision to exclude\r\n  Appellants' expert.Â  Before trial, the court heard Respondents'\r\n  motions to exclude Appellants' expert.Â  Appellants' attorney stated the expert\r\n  was an officer and a master instructor in Taser training.Â  The attorney\r\n  explained the expert looked over the depositions and concurred with her\r\n  assumption that two improper events had occurred during Brenda's arrest.Â \r\n  Appellants' attorney explained her delay in naming the expert was the result of\r\n  her dealing with personal issues: (1) she was trying to resolve issues her\r\n  former partner had with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and (2) she had emergency\r\n  surgery in April, was out of the office for two months, and only worked part\r\n  time in July.Â  She explained she named the expert as soon as she had completed taking\r\n  the officer's depositions, and the expert was able to review them.Â  Respondent\r\n  Greenville Tech's attorney explained she was prejudiced because she was unable\r\n  to identify an expert for her client, and Greenville Tech did not have a chance\r\n  to depose Appellants' expert.Â  While Respondent City of Greenville was able to\r\n  depose Appellants' expert prior to trial, it asserted the lack of notice of the\r\n  designation of an expert witness prevented it from procuring its own expert\r\n  witness.Â  See Jumper v. Hawkins, 348 S.C. at 152, 558 S.E.2d at\r\n  916 (finding a trial judge should\r\n  consider and evaluate the following factors before excluding a witness: &quot;(1)\r\n  the type of witness involved; (2) the content of the evidence emanating from\r\n  the proffered witness; (3) the nature of the failure or neglect or refusal to\r\n  furnish the witness' name; (4) the degree of surprise to the other party,\r\n  including the prior knowledge of the name of the witness; and (5) the prejudice\r\n  to the opposing party&quot;); Arthur v. Sexton Dental Clinic, 368 S.C. 326, 339, 628 S.E.2d 894, 901 (Ct. App. 2006)\r\n  (determining the court did not need to specifically enunciate the five Jumper factors if, based on a review of the record, it is apparent the judge\r\n  considered the factors and made the appropriate inquiry before ultimately\r\n  excluding the challenged witness).Â Â  \r\n5. We find the trial court\r\n  properly excluded Appellants from questioning the officers about section\r\n  17-13-50 of the South Carolina Code.Â  On appeal, Appellants argue this\r\n  was prejudicial to them because Brenda had the right to resist an unlawful\r\n  arrest, and the officers violated the statute.Â  See S.C. Code Ann.

Arial, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Robert\r\n  Watkins appeals his convictions for armed robbery and possession of a weapon\r\n  during the commission of a violent crime. Â His trial resulted from a grant of\r\n  post-conviction relief (PCR) by the South Carolina Supreme Court.Â  The judge of\r\n  that new trial was the same judge who presided over Watkins's PCR hearing.Â  On\r\n  appeal from the new trial, Watkins argues the trial judge erred in (1) denying\r\n  Watkins's recusal motion and (2) granting Watkins's motion to proceed pro se.Â \r\n  We reverse.[1]\r\nGenerally, &quot;[a]\r\n  judge shall disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge's\r\n  impartiality might reasonably be questioned&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot; Â Canon 3(E)(1), CJC, Rule\r\n  501, SCACR.Â  In Floyd v. State, 303 S.C. 298, 400 S.E.2d 145 (1991), the South Carolina Supreme Court granted a defendant a\r\n  new PCR hearing because the judge who presided over his PCR hearing also\r\n  presided over the trial from which PCR was sought.Â  Id. at 299, 400\r\n  S.E.2d at 146.Â  The court held that &quot;in all [PCR] hearings .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;, a judge shall, upon\r\n    motion, recuse himself if he was the judge who presided at the guilty plea,\r\n  criminal trial, or probation revocation proceeding for which relief is being\r\n  sought.&quot;Â  Id. Â The Floyd court emphasized that &quot;a per se rule of\r\n  recusal .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. will eliminate even the suggestion of partiality.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nHere, we find Floyd's\r\n  reasoning is equally applicable to the situation presented by Watkins's new\r\n  trial.&nbsp; As held in Floyd, a judge must grant a recusal motion made\r\n  during a new trial arising from a PCR hearing in which the judge also\r\n  sat.&nbsp; Accordingly, the trial judge erred in denying Watkins's motion for recusal.\r\nBecause we reverse the trial\r\n  court on the above issue, we do not address Watkins's remaining argument.Â  See State v. Taylor,\r\n  388 S.C. 101, 124 n.23, 694 S.E.2d 60, 72 n.23 (Ct. App. 2010) (holding that an\r\n  appellate court need not address remaining issues when a decision on a prior\r\n  issue is dispositive).Â  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  GEATHERS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-092","title":"State v.

Montgomery, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n        Robert Merrell Cook, II, of Batesburg-Leesville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Amerisure Mutual Insurance and its insured, Dooley &amp;\r\n  Mack Construction Company (collectively Appellants), appeal the circuit court's\r\n  ruling that liability for a Dooley &amp; Mack statutory employee's injuries\r\n  could not be transferred to the South Carolina Uninsured Employer's Fund (the\r\n  Fund).Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nDooley &amp; Mack was serving\r\n  as general contractor at a job site in The Cliffs at Keowee, an upscale\r\n  residential community in Greenville County, South Carolina.Â  Dooley &amp; Mack\r\n  hired Smeller Construction to perform work at the job site, and Smeller in turn\r\n  hired Huberto Escoto to perform framing work.Â  One of Escoto's employees,\r\n  Salome Diaz-Cortez, was seriously injured on the job when he fell from a ladder.Â \r\n  Escoto did not have workers' compensation insurance, so Diaz-Cortez's workers'\r\n  compensation claim moved upstream to Smeller.Â  At the time of the contract\r\n  between Dooley &amp; Mack and Smeller, Smeller provided a certificate of\r\n  insurance upon Dooley &amp; Mack's request.Â  The certificate was sent via\r\n  facsimile to Dooley &amp; Mack's Florida office and listed Dooley &amp; Mack\r\n  with its Florida address as the certificate holder.Â  The certificate was sent\r\n  from the listed producer, Spivey Insurance Agency in Austin, Texas. Â The listed\r\n  insured was Steve Smeller based out of Kemp, Texas, and the &quot;description\r\n  of the operation&quot; was listed as &quot;the Cliffs.&quot;Â  The certificate\r\n  was unsigned.Â  \r\nSmeller\r\n  did not in fact have a valid workers' compensation policy in South Carolina and\r\n  so liability for Cortez-Diaz's claim moved upstream yet again to Dooley &amp;\r\n  Mack.Â  After several hearings, it was determined that Cortez-Diaz's claim was\r\n  compensable and that Dooley &amp; Mack was the responsible party as the\r\n  statutory employer.Â  Appellants then sought reimbursement from the Fund, and\r\n  the single commissioner denied the request because Amerisure did not &quot;pay\r\n  in the first instance&quot; as required by section 42-1-415 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2010) and because Smeller's certificate of insurance failed\r\n  to demonstrate coverage in South Carolina.[2]Â  \r\nAn Appellate Panel of the\r\n  South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission (Appellate Panel), however,\r\n  reversed the single commissioner finding Dooley &amp; Mack had presented an\r\n  acceptable certificate of insurance and that the lack of signature did not\r\n  render the certificate insufficient pursuant to Barton v. Higgs, 372\r\n  S.C. 109, 641 S.E.2d 39 (Ct. App. 2007).[3]Â \r\n  Additionally, the Appellate Panel found that although Amerisure &quot;did not\r\n  initially pay this claim in the first instance&quot; as required by section\r\n  42-1-415, the transfer of liability to the Fund was proper.[4]Â  \r\nThe Fund appealed the\r\n  Appellate Panel's order to the circuit court.Â  The circuit court reversed the\r\n  findings of the Appellate Panel relying largely on Hopper v. Terry Hunt\r\n    Construction, 373 S.C. 475, 646 S.E.2d 162 (Ct. App. 2007) aff'd,\r\n  383 S.C. 310, 680 S.E.2d 1 (2009),[5] an opinion released during the pendency of the appeal from the Appellate\r\n  Panel's order.Â  The circuit court concluded Smeller's certificate of insurance\r\n  was &quot;facially insufficient&quot; to indicate coverage in South Carolina\r\n  and further held Amerisure failed to pay in the first instance under section\r\n  42-1-415 thereby barring the transfer of liability to the Fund.Â  The circuit\r\n  court did not render its findings based on the lack of signature on the\r\n  certificate of insurance, but noted the South Carolina Supreme Court had\r\n  granted a writ of certiorari to review Barton.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South\r\n  Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) governs judicial review of a\r\n  decision of the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v.\r\n    Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981); Bass v.\r\n      Isochem, 365 S.C. 454, 467, 617 S.E.2d 369, 376 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Pursuant\r\n  to the APA, an appellate court's review is limited to deciding whether the full commission's decision is unsupported by substantial\r\n    evidence or is controlled by some error of law.Â  Grant v. Grant Textiles,\r\n  372 S.C. 196, 200-01, 641 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2007).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Fund maintains the\r\n  circuit court's decision should be affirmed on the additional sustaining ground\r\n  that Smeller's certificate of insurance was unsigned.Â  We agree.\r\nIn finding the certificate of\r\n  insurance in this case met the requirements of section 42-1-415 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2010), the Appellate Panel relied in part on Barton v.\r\n    Higgs, which held that documentation of workers' compensation coverage\r\n  could be sufficient even without a signature provided the documentation was on\r\n  a &quot;standard form acceptable to the commission.&quot;Â  387 S.C. 109, 117,\r\n  641 S.E.2d 39, 44.Â  However, that ruling was reversed by the South Carolina\r\n  Supreme Court.Â Â  See Barton v. Higgs, 381 S.C. 367, 371, 674\r\n  S.E.2d 145, 147 (2009) (&quot;[B]y failing to collect\r\n  a signed Certificate of Insurance form, [the contractor] failed to meet the\r\n  requirement as set forth in the regulation [67-415].&quot;).[6]Â Â \r\n  In this case, the certificate of insurance presented by Smeller was unsigned.Â \r\n  Therefore, it was insufficient to transfer liability to the Fund under section\r\n  42-1-415, and we affirm the circuit court's ruling on that basis. See I'On L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406,\r\n  420, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000) (holding the appellate court may consider\r\n  additional sustaining grounds raised by the respondent &quot;and, if convinced\r\n  it is proper and fair to do so, rely on them or any other reason appearing in\r\n  the record to affirm the lower court's judgment&quot;); see also Rule\r\n  220(c), SCACR (&quot;The appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, decision\r\n  or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.&quot;).Â  \r\nAccordingly, we need not\r\n  address the issues raised by Appellants regarding whether the certificate of\r\n  insurance indicated Smeller had coverage in South Carolina or whether\r\n  Appellants failed to pay in the first instance.Â  See Futch v.\r\n    McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591,\r\n  598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not address remaining issues when\r\n  the determination of another issue is dispositive of the appeal).Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, LOCKEMY, JJ., and\r\n  GOOLSBY, A.J., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide\r\n  this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Section 42-1-415(A) of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (Supp. 2010) provides:Â  &quot;In the event that\r\n  employer is uninsured, regardless of the number of employees that employer has,\r\n  the higher tier subcontractor, contractor, project owner, or his insurance\r\n  carrier shall in the first instance pay all benefits due under this\r\n  title.&quot;\r\n[3] In Barton,\r\n  the court determined the lack of a signature did not necessarily preclude a\r\n  certificate of insurance from being sufficient to transfer liability to the\r\n  Fund.Â  Id. at 117, 641 S.E.2d at 44.\r\n[4] The Appellate\r\n  Panel's decision was a split decision with Commissioner David W.

(collectively Appellants), appeal the circuit court's ruling that\r\n  liability for a Cogdell Group's statutory employee's injuries could not be\r\n  transferred to the South Carolina Uninsured Employer's Fund (the Fund).Â  We\r\n  affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nCogdell Group managed the\r\n  McLeod Medical Plaza building in Florence, South Carolina.Â  The janitorial\r\n  services for the facility were contracted out to Woods ProClean.Â  One of Woods\r\n  ProClean's employees, Louis Alyward, was injured on the job.Â  At the time of\r\n  the contract between Cogdell Group and Woods ProClean, Woods ProClean provided\r\n  two certificates of insurance to Cogdell Group.Â  The first certificate was\r\n  issued on April 30, 1998, from Geller Insurance Agency, Inc. in Lenexa, Kansas,\r\n  and the insured was listed as ProClean of Leavenworth, Kansas. The certificate\r\n  holder was listed as &quot;The Cogdell Group Incorpated: The McLeod Regional\r\n  Medical Center of the Pee Dee.&quot;Â  The description of operations field was\r\n  left blank.Â  The second certificate was received May 19, 1998, to satisfy a\r\n  Cogdell Group requirement that it be listed as an additional insured on all\r\n  certificates.Â  \r\nThe second certificate was\r\n  identical to the first with two exceptions.Â  The certificate holder field read,\r\n  &quot;McLeod Regional Medical Center of the Pee Dee, c/o Cogdall [sic]\r\n  Group/Deno Keretses, 305 E Cheves St, St 220, Florence, SC 29506,&quot; and the\r\n  description of operations showed &quot;Cogdall [sic] Group Inc. is the\r\n  Management Company.Â  See Certificate - Addl Insured.&quot;Â  \r\nAfter several years of\r\n  litigation, it was determined Woods ProClean did not in fact have valid\r\n  workers' compensation coverage in South Carolina and so liability for Alyward's\r\n  claim moved upstream to Cogdell Group.Â  Following several hearings, the\r\n  conclusion was reached that Alyward's claim was compensable and that Cogdell\r\n  Group was the responsible party as the statutory employer.Â  \r\nAppellants then sought\r\n  reimbursement from the Fund.Â  The single commissioner denied the request\r\n  finding the certificates of insurance provided to Cogdell Group failed on their\r\n  faces to demonstrate coverage in South Carolina as required by section 42-1-415\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (2010) and Hopper v. Terry Hunt Construction,\r\n  373 S.C. 475, 646 S.E.2d 162 (Ct. App. 2007), aff'd, 383 S.C. 310, 680\r\n  S.E.2d 1 (2009).Â  An Appellate Panel of the South Carolina Workers'\r\n  Compensation Commission (Appellate Panel) affirmed the single commissioner, and\r\n  the circuit court affirmed the Appellate Panel's order.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe South\r\n  Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) governs judicial review of a\r\n  decision of the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v.\r\n    Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981); Bass v.\r\n      Isochem, 365 S.C. 454, 467, 617 S.E.2d 369, 376 (Ct.

Grant Textiles,\r\n  372 S.C. 196, 200-01, 641 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2007). Â &quot;Substantial evidence\r\n  is not a mere scintilla of evidence, but evidence which, considering the record\r\n  as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the agency\r\n  reached.&quot; Â Tennant v. Beaufort Cnty. Sch. Dist., 381 S.C. 617, 620,\r\n  674 S.E.2d 488, 490 (2009).Â  &quot;In workers' compensation cases, the [Appellate\r\n  Panel] is the ultimate fact finder.&quot;Â  Jordan v. Kelly Co., 381 S.C.\r\n  483, 486, 674 S.E.2d 166, 168 (2009).\r\nIn Hopper v. Terry Hunt\r\n  Construction, 373 S.C. 475, 482-83, 646 S.E.2d 162, 166 (Ct. App. 2007),\r\n  the court determined as a matter of law that section 42-1-415 of the South\r\n  Caroline Code requires an upstream contractor to obtain a certificate of\r\n  insurance indicating worker's compensation coverage in South Carolina exists in\r\n  order to transfer liability to the Fund.Â  In reaching this decision the court\r\n  stated:\r\nOur\r\n  ruling today does not put an extra duty upon the general contractor to inquire\r\n  into the validity of the subcontractor's coverage.Â  However, a general\r\n  contractor cannot expect to turn a blind eye to the subcontractor's obvious\r\n  lack of coverage in South Carolina and have the State shoulder that burden.Â  A\r\n  determination of what type of conduct constitutes an obvious lack of coverage\r\n  in South Carolina will have to be settled on a case-by case basis.Â  \r\nId. at 483 n.1, 646 S.E.2d at 166 n.1.\r\nIn this case, the Appellate\r\n  Panel determined the certificates presented were insufficient under section\r\n  42-1-415 to allow Cogdell Group to shift liability to the Fund.Â  The Appellate\r\n  Panel did not directly address the Cogdell Group's argument regarding the\r\n  identity of the certificate holder as &quot;The McLeod Regional Medical Center\r\n  of the Pee Dee.&quot;Â  The circuit court found, however, substantial evidence supported\r\n  the Appellate Panel's findings.Â  The circuit court further indicated the\r\n  identity of the certificate holder and the faxing of the certificate to a South\r\n  Carolina location was insufficient to undermine the Appellate Panel's factual\r\n  findings when the producer and insured were both listed as Kansas entities and\r\n  the description of operations field was left blank.Â  The second certificate\r\n  provided no additional information regarding the existence of coverage in a\r\n  particular location but simply satisfied the Cogdell Group's requirement that\r\n  it be listed as an additional insured.Â  \r\nAppellants correctly note that\r\n  in Hopper all three parties, the producer the insured, and the\r\n  certificate holder, were listed as Georgia entities.Â  Hopper, 373 S.C.\r\n  at 484, 646 S.E.2d at 167.Â  The Hopper court concluded, however, the\r\n  certificate did not indicate &quot;in which state, if any, [the subcontractor]\r\n  had workers' compensation coverage.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The identity of the\r\n  certificate holder in a particular state, therefore, does not necessarily\r\n  demonstrate coverage in that state under Hopper.Â  Otherwise, the Hopper court would have concluded the certificate demonstrated coverage in Georgia,\r\n  the locale of the certificate holder, instead of opining the certificate did\r\n  not indicate coverage in any particular state. \r\nBased on our standard of\r\n  review, we conclude the circuit court did not err in affirming the Appellate\r\n  Panel as its findings were supported by substantial evidence in the record.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, LOCKEMY, JJ., and\r\n  GOOLSBY, A.J., concur. \r\n\r\n[1]We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-095","title":"State v.

Tefft (Husband) appeals the family court's September 4, 2008 order requiring\r\n  him to comply with a post-nuptial and reconciliation agreement, arguing the\r\n  family court erred in: (1) finding an earlier family court order approving the\r\n  reconciliation agreement was a final order; and (2) declaring its September 4,\r\n  2008 order to be a final order.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\n1. We hold the family court did not err in finding the order\r\n  approving the reconciliation agreement was a final order.Â  &quot;If a judgment\r\n  leaves some further act to be done by the court before the rights of the\r\n  parties are determined, the judgment is not final.&quot;Â  S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Transp. v. Faulkenberry, 337 S.C. 140, 146, 522 S.E.2d 822, 825 (Ct. App.\r\n  1999).Â  &quot;An order is not final until it is entered by the clerk of court;\r\n  and until the order or judgment is entered by the clerk of the court, the judge\r\n  retains control of the case.&quot;Â  Upchurch v. Upchurch, 367 S.C. 16,\r\n  22, 624 S.E.2d 643, 646 (2006).Â  Here, the order was final because: (1) it\r\n  resolved all the rights of Husband and Ashley Tefft (Wife) for purposes of both\r\n  their separation and reconciliation; and (2) the clerk of court entered the\r\n  order into the record.Â  Additionally, we note insofar as Husband is attempting\r\n  to challenge the underlying validity of the reconciliation agreement, he is\r\n  bound by the terms of the reconciliation agreement because he freely and\r\n  voluntarily entered into the agreement.Â  See Moseley v. Mosier,\r\n  279 S.C. 348, 353, 306 S.E.2d 624, 627 (1983) (&quot;The parties may\r\n  specifically agree . . . to any terms they wish as long as the court deems the\r\n  contract to have been entered fairly, voluntarily and reasonably. With the\r\n  court's approval, the terms become a part of the decree and are binding on\r\n    the parties and the court.&quot; (emphasis added)).Â  Lastly, we note\r\n  Husband did not appeal the family court's order approving the reconciliation\r\n  agreement.Â  See Ware v. Ware, 390 S.C. 493, 499, 702 S.E.2d 390,\r\n  393 (Ct. App. 2010) (finding an unappealed ruling, right or wrong, is the law\r\n  of the case).Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â \r\n2. We hold any\r\n  error on behalf of the family court in declaring its September 4, 2008 order[2] to be a final order was harmless\r\n  because Husband has not suffered any\r\n  prejudice resulting from his inability to file pleadings in Wife's second\r\n  action for divorce.Â  A review of the record indicates Husband is still able to\r\n  litigate and file pleadings for the issues surrounding the divorce because Wife\r\n  initiated a third action for divorce on March 6, 2009, for which Husband has\r\n  already filed an answer and several counterclaims.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the\r\n  family court's ruling.Â  See Davis\r\n    v.

Tanner, of Bamberg, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  George\r\n  Wyman Oxner (Husband) appeals the family court's order finding a substantial\r\n  change in circumstances existed warranting a reduction in his alimony payments\r\n  to Johnnie Mimms Oxner (Wife).Â  He argues the family court erred in: (1)\r\n  declining to terminate his alimony payments to Wife, or failing to reduce his\r\n  alimony payments by the amount received by Wife from the pension because his\r\n  retirement was not foreseeable and Wife's income increased since the divorce;\r\n  (2) finding Husband's pension was property instead of income replacement; and\r\n  (3) awarding attorney's fees to Wife.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\n1. We hold the family court did not abuse its discretion in\r\n  declining to terminate Husband's alimony payments or failing to reduce his\r\n  alimony payments by the amount received by Wife from the pension.Â  &quot;The\r\n  question of whether to increase or decrease alimony based on a finding of\r\n  changed circumstances is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the\r\n  family court.&quot;Â  Gartside v. Gartside, 383 S.C. 35, 42, 677 S.E.2d\r\n  621, 625 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  Here, Husband continued to earn more income than\r\n  Wife even after he retired and also possessed close to $50,000 in various\r\n  investments.Â  In comparison, Wife testified she would not be able to meet her\r\n  current expenses without continued alimony payments from Husband, and her only\r\n  source of income was from her current job.Â  Additionally, the payments to Wife\r\n  from Husband's pension plan could not be considered in determining alimony\r\n  modification because it was within the contemplation of the parties at the time\r\n  of the divorce.Â  The original property settlement agreement specifically\r\n  contemplated Husband's retirement at a future time and consequently addressed\r\n  the division of Husband's pension plan between Husband and Wife.Â  See Serowski\r\n    v. Serowski, 381 S.C. 306, 313, 672 S.E.2d 589, 593 (Ct. App. 2009) (&quot;Changes\r\n  in circumstances within the contemplation of the parties at the time the\r\n  divorce was entered generally do not provide a basis for modifying\r\n  alimony.&quot;).Â  Â Â Â Â \r\n2. We hold\r\n  the issue of whether Husband's pension\r\n  was property instead of income replacement is not preserved for appellate\r\n  review because the family court did not specifically rule on this issue in its\r\n  final order and Husband did not file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion.Â  See West\r\n    v. Newberry Elec. Co-op., 357 S.C. 537, 543, 593 S.E.2d 500, 503 (Ct. App. 2004)\r\n  (finding an issue was not preserved when it was not explicitly ruled on by the\r\n  trial court in its final order and the appellant did not raise the issue in a\r\n  Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend the judgment).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n3. We hold the family\r\n  court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney's fees to Wife because\r\n  it properly considered all the relevant factors recited in Glasscock v.\r\n    Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991) and E.D.M. v.\r\n      T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  See Patel\r\n        v.

Ganjehsani, all of\r\n  Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Stacy W. Howard appeals the circuit\r\n  court's denial of his petition for a writ of mandamus and dismissal of his\r\n  action, arguing: (1) he was denied due process when he was not served with\r\n  notice ofÂ  Pamela O. Cartee's motion to dismiss; (2) Cartee's voluntary\r\n  appearance in court by her counsel was equivalent to personal service of\r\n  Howard's summons and complaint; (3) the circuit court erred in dismissing his\r\n  complaint on the basis that his actions constituted an impermissible form of\r\n  hybrid representation; (4) he was entitled to a copy of primary and backup\r\n  tapes according to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Rule 607(i),\r\n  SCACR; (5) Rule 607(i) directly conflicts with the legislative intent in\r\n  sections 14-13-10 and 14-13-20 of the South Carolina Code (1977); (6) the\r\n  circuit court erred in failing to rule on motions for recusal and change of\r\n  venue; and (7) the circuit court erred in failing to rule on his Rule 59(e),\r\n  SCRCP motion.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\n1.&nbsp; As to whether the circuit court\r\n  erred in denying Howard's request for tapes of his trial based on an\r\n  impermissible form of hybrid representation:Â  At the time Howard filed his pro\r\n  se complaint for the tapes of his trial, the Office of Appellate Defense had\r\n  already been appointed to represent him for purposes of his direct appeal and\r\n  had in fact already contacted Cartee regarding the errors in the trial\r\n  transcript.Â  Thus, Howard made an invalid pro se request for the primary and\r\n  backup copies of the trial tapes.Â  Because Howard was represented by counsel,\r\n  any request for the trial tapes was required to be made by his counsel.Â  See State v. Stuckey, 333 S.C. 56, 58, 508 S.E.2d 564, 564 (1998)\r\n  (&quot;[Because] there is no right to hybrid representation, substantive\r\n  documents filed [pro se] by a person represented by counsel are not accepted\r\n  unless submitted by counsel.&quot;).[2]Â \r\n  Â Â Â Â \r\n2.&nbsp; As to whether the circuit court\r\n  erred in failing to rule on Howard's Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion:Â  Howard failed\r\n  to comply with the requirements of Rule 59, SCRCP because he filed his motion\r\n  on February 13, 2008, almost one month before the circuit court issued\r\n  its final order on March 6, 2008.Â  See Rule 59(e), SCRCP (&quot;A motion\r\n  to alter or amend the judgment shall be served no later than 10 days after\r\n  receipt of written notice of the entry of the order.&quot;).Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  circuit court correctly declined to rule on Howard's Rule 59(e) motion.Â  \r\n3.&nbsp; As\r\n  to Howard's remaining issues:Â  These issues are not preserved for appellate\r\n  review.Â  See Jones v. Lott, 387 S.C. 339, 346, 692 S.E.2d 900,\r\n  903 (2010) (&quot;Issues and arguments are preserved for appellate review only\r\n  when they are raised to and ruled on by the lower court.&quot;) (internal\r\n  quotation marks omitted); Dixon v.

Gibbs, pro se, of Anderson, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The\r\n  Department of Motor Vehicles (the DMV) appeals the reinstatement of Dominic\r\n  Gibbs's driver's license by the Administrative Law Court (the ALC).Â  Gibbs did\r\n  not file a respondentâ€™s brief.Â  We reverse and remand.[1]\r\nThe ALC held the\r\n  DMV improperly declared Gibbs a habitual offender because one of Gibbs' three driving\r\n  under suspension convictions could not support habitual offender status.Â  The ALC\r\n  ruled the offense fell under a statutory exception that precluded basing habitual offender status upon convictions of driving\r\n  under suspension for the failure to file proof of financial responsibility.Â  The\r\n  DMV argues the relevant conviction of driving under suspension did not fall\r\n  within that exception because the suspension was based upon a different\r\n  offense: the failure to show proof of insurance when stopped by a police\r\n  officer.Â  We agree.\r\nWhen this court reviews an\r\n  ALC's decision on appeal from the DMV, this court may\r\n  reverse or modify the decision if the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  S.C. Dep't of Motor Vehicles v. Holtzclaw, 382 S.C. 344, 347, 675 S.E.2d\r\n  756, 758 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  The supreme court has focused on the plain language\r\n  of the habitual offender statute when construing its meaning.Â  S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Motor Vehicles v. Blackwell, 389 S.C. 293, 296, 698 S.E.2d 770, 772 (2010).Â \r\n  Under that statute, the DMV may declare a person a habitual offender if the\r\n  person has been convicted of three or more qualifying offenses committed within\r\n  a three-year period.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-1-1020(a) (2006).Â  Those qualifying\r\n  offenses include driving under suspension, &quot;except a conviction for\r\n  driving under suspension for failure to file proof of financial responsibility\r\n  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;Â  Â§ 56-1-1020(a)(4).Â  \r\nHere, we hold the ALC erred\r\n  in treating Gibbs's conviction of driving under suspension for failure to show\r\n  proof of insurance to a police officer as the same offense as a conviction of\r\n  driving under suspension for failure to file proof of financial\r\n  responsibility.Â  The habitual offender statute's exception refers to various\r\n  sections of the Motor Vehicle Financial\r\n  Responsibility Act requiring a person to file a certificate of insurance\r\n  or bond with the DMV.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-9-540 to -570 (2006) (&quot;Proof of financial responsibility when required\r\n  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. may be given by filing [with the DMV]: (1) [a] certificate of insurance .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;[or]\r\n  (2) [a] bond .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  56-9-361, -460 (2006) (providing that the DMV may\r\n  allow a suspended driver to keep a license to operate a vehicle owned by an\r\n  employer if the employer &quot;furnishe[s] proof of financial responsibility\r\n  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-9-440, -470 (2006)\r\n  (providing that if a judgment creditor of a motor vehicle accident consents,\r\n  the judgment debtor who was uninsured at the time of the accident may retain\r\n  driving privileges so long as the judgment debtor &quot;furnishes proof of\r\n  financial responsibility,&quot; and if the judgment creditor does not so\r\n  consent, the judgment debtor's license will remain suspended until the debtor\r\n  fully satisfies every judgment and &quot;gives proof of financial\r\n  responsibility .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-10-540 (2006) (&quot;Whenever any proof of financial responsibility filed by any\r\n  person as required by [the Act] no longer fulfills the purpose for which\r\n  required, the director shall require other proof of financial responsibility\r\n  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;). Â \r\nUnlike those\r\n  sections, the statute for the failure to show a police officer proof of insurance\r\n  is a different offense from the failure to file proof of financial\r\n  responsibility with the DMV.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 56-10-225(A)-(B) (2006) (providing &quot;[a] person whose application for registration and licensing of a motor\r\n  vehicle has been approved by the [DMV] must maintain in the motor vehicle at\r\n  all times proof that the motor vehicle is an insured vehicle&quot; and\r\n  &quot;[t]he owner of a motor vehicle must maintain proof of financial\r\n  responsibility in the motor vehicle at all times, and it must be displayed upon\r\n  demand of a police officer .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;).Â  Therefore, the\r\n  habitual offender statute's exception does not apply to a conviction for\r\n  driving under suspension for failure to show proof of insurance to a police\r\n  officer.Â  The ALC erred in holding Gibbs's conviction could not support the\r\n  DMV's declaration that he was a habitual offender.Â  \r\nBecause we reverse the ALC on\r\n  the above issue, we do not address the DMV's remaining arguments.Â  See Bailey v. S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Health, 388 S.C. 1, 8, 693 S.E.2d 426, 430 (Ct.

Weaver, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Kenneth Dippel and Kimber Fowler (Appellants), pro se,\r\n  appeal the circuit court's (1) denial of their motion for an order of reference\r\n  and change of venue and (2) the grant of the Horry County Planning Department's\r\n  (the Department) motion to strike and motion to dismiss.Â  We affirm in part,\r\n  reverse in part, and remand.[1]\r\nThis appeal concerns the Department's\r\n  refusal to approve Appellants' submitted plat.Â  After the Department did not\r\n  approve the plat, Appellants unsuccessfully appealed to the Horry County\r\n  Planning Commission.Â  Subsequently, Appellants appealed this determination to\r\n  the circuit court.Â  Appellants' appeal, manifested in a lengthy document styled\r\n  as a &quot;complaint,&quot; alleged three causes of action.Â  Appellants\r\n  asserted (1) a judicial taking, (2) the Department's failed to comply with a\r\n  court order, and (3) an action that constituted an appeal of the Planning Commission's\r\n  adverse determination.Â  Upon motion by the Department, the circuit court struck\r\n  all allegations and causes of action not related to a direct appeal of the\r\n  Planning Commission's plat determination. Â Subsequently, the circuit court\r\n  dismissed the appeal on procedural grounds because Appellants failed to file a\r\n  pre-litigation request for mediation with the notice of appeal and failed to\r\n  join necessary parties.Â  Appellants appealed this decision, asserting the\r\n  circuit court erred in striking actions from their complaint and in dismissing their\r\n  appeal.Â  Appellants also contend error in the denial of their motion for an\r\n  order of reference and change of venue.\r\n&quot;A property owner whose\r\n  land is the subject of a decision of the planning commission may appeal by\r\n  filing a notice of appeal with the circuit court accompanied by a request for\r\n  pre-litigation mediation in accordance with section 6-29-1155.&quot;Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 6-29-1150(D)(2) (Supp. 2010). &quot;If a property owner files a notice\r\n  of appeal with a request for pre-litigation mediation, the request for\r\n  mediation must be granted . . . .&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-1155(A) (Supp.\r\n  2010).Â  When interpretation of a statute is required, &quot;words must be given\r\n  their plain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced\r\n  construction to limit or expand the statute's operation.&quot;Â  State v.\r\n    Blackmon, 304 S.C. 270, 273, 403 S.E.2d 660, 662 (1991).\r\nWe find the circuit court\r\n  erred in basing the dismissal of Appellants' appeal on their failure to file a\r\n  request for pre-litigation mediation.Â  The Department contends sections 6-29-1150\r\n  and 6-29-1155 require the mandatory filing of a request for mediation along\r\n  with a notice of appeal in order to properly appeal a decision by the Planning\r\n  Commission.Â  We believe a plain and ordinary reading of the statute reveals\r\n  that it merely informs a potential appellant of the option and procedure for\r\n  filing a request for mediation.Â  Specifically, section 6-29-1150(D)(2) provides\r\n  a property owner &quot;may appeal by filing a notice of appeal with the circuit\r\n  court accompanied by a request for pre-litigation mediation in accordance with\r\n  section 6-29-1155.&quot;Â  Section 6-29-1155 in turn provides: &quot;[i]f a\r\n  property owner files a notice of appeal with a request for pre-litigation\r\n  mediation . . . .&quot;Â  Reading these two sections together indicates the\r\n  mediation request is an optional step in appealing the decision of a planning\r\n  commission.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court's grant of dismissal on\r\n  this ground.\r\nAs a second ground for\r\n  dismissal, the circuit court found Appellants failed to join necessary\r\n  parties.Â  We find the circuit court erred in failing to make findings of fact\r\n  to support the dismissal of Appellants' appeal for failure to join necessary\r\n  parties.\r\n\r\n  A\r\n    person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive\r\n    the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action shall be joined\r\n    as a party in the action if (1) in his absence complete relief cannot be\r\n    accorded among those already parties, or (2) he claims an interest relating to\r\n    the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action\r\n    in his absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to\r\n    protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject\r\n    to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent\r\n    obligations by reason of his claimed interest.\r\n\r\nRule 19, SCRCP.Â  &quot;[A]\r\n  development permittee is a necessary party to an appeal of its permit.&quot;Â  Spanish\r\n    Wells Prop.

Â But the findings must be sufficient to\r\n    allow this [c]ourt, sitting in its appellate capacity, to ensure the law is\r\n    faithfully executed below. The absence of factual findings makes our task of\r\n    reviewing the court order impossible because &quot;the reasons underlying the\r\n    decision [are] left to speculation.&quot;Â  \r\n\r\nÂ In re Treatment and Care\r\n  of Luckabaugh,&nbsp;351 S.C. 122, 133, 568 S.E.2d 338, 343&nbsp;(2002).\r\nÂ  The circuit court's order\r\n  relies on Spanish Wells to support the contention that Appellants failed\r\n  to join necessary parties to the appeal of the Planning Commission decision.[2]Â \r\n  The order indicates unnamed parties were necessary because the determination of\r\n  the Planning Commission directly affected their existing access to these\r\n  parcels.Â  The circuit court's order states, &quot;These parties occupy an\r\n  analogous position to an owner whose application approval is appealed, since\r\n  appeal could result in reversal of the access rights recognized by the Planning\r\n  Commission.&quot;Â  Notwithstanding these analogies, the paucity of information\r\n  concerning the purported necessary parties makes it difficult to determine if\r\n  the circuit court's legal conclusions are correct.Â  See Luckabaugh,\r\n  351 S.C. at 132-133, 568 S.E.2d at 343 (quoting Coble v. Coble, 268\r\n  S.E.2d 185, 189 (N.C.1980)) (&quot;Trial courts, sitting without juries in an\r\n  action at law, write their findings specially and separately: to allow a\r\n  reviewing court to determine from the record whether the judgment and the legal\r\n  conclusions which underlie it represent a correct application of the law. The\r\n  requirement for appropriately detailed findings is thus not a mere formality or\r\n  a rule of empty ritual; it is designed instead to dispose of the issues raised\r\n  by the pleadings and to allow the appellate courts to perform their proper\r\n  function in the judicial system.&quot;).Â \r\n  The circuit court's order neither provides the identities of the purported\r\n  necessary parties nor fully describes how these parties are &quot;directly\r\n  affected&quot; by the Planning Commission's determination beyond unspecified\r\n  effects on their existing access.Â  Accordingly, we remand for the circuit court\r\n  to clarify the nature and identity of the purported necessary parties and if\r\n  necessary to consider the appeal on its merits.\r\nTo the extent Appellants\r\n  asserted original causes of action in their appeal from the Planning Commission,\r\n  the circuit court's decision is affirmed.\r\nFinally, we affirm the\r\n  circuit court's denial of Appellants' motion for an order of reference and\r\n  change of venue.Â  Because the underlying action is an appeal from a planning\r\n  commission decision, reference to a master-in-equity is not appropriate\r\n  pursuant to Rule 53, SCRCP, and the circuit court did not err.Â  Likewise, venue\r\n  in Horry County is proper and we find no error in the circuit court's denial of\r\n  this motion.Â Â  Â Â \r\nAFFIRMED IN\r\n  PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nFEW, C.J.,\r\n  KONDUROS, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The order does not reveal the identity of these\r\n  parties. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-109","title":"Dippel v.

As to whether the\r\n  family court erred in awarding Wife half of the marital estate: The family court properly considered the relevant\r\n  factors in apportioning the marital property and made extensive written and\r\n  oral findings regarding these factors.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-620 (Supp. 2010); Doe v. Doe, 370 S.C. 206, 213, 634 S.E.2d 51, 55 (Ct. App. 2006) (&quot;The division of marital\r\n  property is in the family court's discretion and will not be disturbed absent\r\n  an abuse of that discretion.&quot;).Â  Additionally, the record contains evidence supporting each of those\r\n  findings.Â  \r\nHusband's argument that the\r\n  family court placed an extensive amount of weight on the length of marriage is\r\n  without merit.Â  The duration of the marriage is a factor the family court must\r\n  consider.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-620(1). Furthermore, Husband failed to\r\n  demonstrate special circumstances that would merit a deviation from the\r\n  equitable division of the marital property.Â  SeeAvery v. Avery,\r\n  370 S.C. 304, 312, 634 S.E.2d 668, 672 (Ct. App. 2006) (holding if a\r\n  party can show special circumstances the family court can tilt &quot;the\r\n  equitable division scale in favor of one spouse&quot;). Â Although Husband contributed more financially than\r\n  Wife, both parties contributed financially to the marital estate.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Wife served as the primary caretaker of the home and child. Â Â Moreover, Husband\r\n  was in a better financial position because he was still employed and planned on\r\n  working until he reached full retirement.Â  \r\n2. As to whether the\r\n  family court erred in awarding Wife $1,975 in monthly alimony: Â The family court did not abuse its discretion in\r\n  ordering Husband to pay Wife $1,975 in monthly alimony.Â  See Davis v. Davis, 372 S.C. 64, 79, 641 S.E.2d 446, 453-54 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2006) (&quot;An award of alimony rests\r\n  within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.&quot;).Â  In awarding Wife alimony, the family court considered the length of\r\n  marriage, Husband's and Wife's ages and health, educational background and\r\n  employment history of each spouse, their standard of living, anticipated\r\n  earnings and expenses of each spouse, and marital and non-marital property.Â \r\n  The family court properly considered the relevant factors in determining the\r\n  amount of alimony, and the record contains evidence supporting each of those\r\n  findings.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2010); see also Davis, 372 S.C. at 80, 641 S.E.2d at 454 (&quot;Our inquiry on appeal is not whether the family court\r\n  gave the same weight to particular factors as this court would have; rather,\r\n  our inquiry extends only to whether the family court abused its considerable\r\n  discretion in assigning weight to the applicable factors.&quot;).Â  \r\nAdditionally, Husband's\r\n  argument that the alimony was excessive is without merit because the alimony\r\n  would provide Wife with sufficient funds to cover her expenses and it did not\r\n  provide her with significant additional funds. Â Furthermore, Husband's argument\r\n  that Wife is not entitled to alimony because she has inherited a home and has\r\n  received a significant marital estate is unpersuasive.Â Â  The purpose of alimony\r\n  is to ensure Wife is in the similar position as she experienced during her\r\n  marriage.Â  Currently, Wife's only monthly income is $1,057 in social security\r\n  benefits, but her expenses total over $2,500, leaving her a deficit of $1,465\r\n  per month. Â Accordingly, the record supports a finding that alimony is\r\n  necessary to maintain her lifestyle.Â  Furthermore, the family court noted that\r\n  it adjusted Husband's alimony requirements due to Wife's inherited property.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, SHORT, and PIEPER,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-111","title":"Dempsey v.

Carrigg, Jr., of Irmo, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  After Hugh\r\n  Allen Hoover began developing his property on Lake Murray, Kem Dempsey and L.A.\r\n  Blue (collectively, Appellants) sought declaratory judgment and injunctive\r\n  relief against both Hoover and Richland County (the County).Â  The circuit court\r\n  granted summary judgment in favor of Hoover and the County.Â  Appellants appeal,\r\n  arguing the circuit court erred (1) in finding they presented no justiciable\r\n  controversy and (2) in ruling Appellants failed to demonstrate irreparable\r\n  harm.Â  We affirm.Â  Â Â Â \r\nFACTS\r\nHoover\r\n  was a building inspector employed by the County.Â  He and Appellants owned waterfront\r\n  property located on Lake Murray in the County.Â  Dempsey's property adjoined\r\n  Hoover's, and Blue's property was nearby on the other side of the cove.Â  In\r\n  April 2003, Hoover cleared trees from his property.Â  Five months later, the\r\n  County approved Hoover's request to subdivide his property into three separate\r\n  lots.Â  Appellants complained to the County that Hoover's development activities\r\n  violated county codes, ordinances, and protocols.Â  The County halted Hoover's\r\n  development activities twice but later allowed them to proceed.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  October 2006, Appellants filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment and\r\n  injunctive relief against Hoover and the County.Â  Appellants alleged Hoover\r\n  developed his property without first securing the required county approval of\r\n  storm water management and erosion control plans, graded the property without a\r\n  permit, and installed an unpermitted office trailer instead of the modular home\r\n  for which he had obtained a permit.Â  In addition, Appellants asserted Hoover\r\n  improperly installed sewer lines on his property that had to be dug up and\r\n  re-installed, leaving open trenches, after the South Carolina Department of\r\n  Transportation determined the lines encroached on its right of way.Â  Appellants\r\n  claimed Hoover's actions caused &quot;extreme erosion&quot; of the cleared\r\n  land.Â  Appellants also alleged Hoover committed fraud by listing the property\r\n  as his primary residence for tax purposes and by paying for only one sewer tap\r\n  line but installing four.Â  With regard to the County, Appellants alleged that\r\n  despite their reports of Hoover's misdeeds, the County refused to investigate\r\n  or enforce its ordinances.Â  \r\nAppellants\r\n  sought three declaratory judgments against Hoover. Â First, they sought a declaration\r\n  that Hoover illegally cleared and graded his property, erected an office\r\n  trailer without a permit, improperly placed four sewer taps, failed to comply\r\n  with permitting and setback requirements, and abused his position as an\r\n  employee of the County.Â  They sought a second declaration that Hoover\r\n  fraudulently used his property as his primary residence for tax purposes.Â  They\r\n  sought a third declaration that he committed other failures relating to\r\n  subdividing his property.Â  Appellants also sought a declaration that the County\r\n  failed to inspect or investigate Hoover's development, failed to enforce codes\r\n  and ordinances, and afforded Hoover preferential treatment in the development\r\n  of his property.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  addition, Appellants applied for three types of injunctive relief against both\r\n  Hoover and the County.Â  Appellants sought an order enjoining Hoover from\r\n  conducting additional work on his property and from further subdividing it.Â \r\n  They also sought an injunction preventing the County from issuing any\r\n  certificates of occupancy for Hoover's property.Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court denied Appellants' motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO)\r\n  and preliminary injunction, noting in its order that their counsel conceded\r\n  they would not suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction.[1]Â \r\n  On May 7, 2007, the County issued a certificate of occupancy permitting Hoover\r\n  to move into his new structure.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  his deposition, Dempsey testified Hoover's development and failure to maintain\r\n  his property were eroding the soil and &quot;damaging the water quality of that\r\n  cove, which [a]ffects the value also of our property, and also the use of the\r\n  lake and our pleasure of using the lake.&quot;Â  When asked whether the sediment\r\n  from Hoover's eroding land was deposited into the lake, Dempsey stated he was\r\n  not sure.Â  However, he had a gut feeling that the erosion was causing the\r\n  market value of his own property to drop.Â  Although Dempsey had consulted with\r\n  an unidentified man about possible devaluation of his property, the man\r\n  declined to express an opinion about the impact of Hoover's activity on the\r\n  value of Dempsey's property.Â  Dempsey's concern about possible devaluation of\r\n  his property came from comments made by neighbors and visitors to his property.Â  \r\nBlue\r\n  recalled at his deposition that his information on Hoover's clearing and\r\n  construction activities came from Dempsey, who &quot;had written notes.&quot;Â \r\n  Blue believed eroding sediment from Hoover's cleared tract would be carried\r\n  into the cove, which Blue and his neighbors had dredged, and would limit their\r\n  access to navigable water.Â Â Â  \r\nAppellants\r\n  deposed Hoover's immediate supervisor, Marvin Phipps.Â  According to Phipps,\r\n  each building is designated as being either for business occupancy or\r\n  residential occupancy.Â  Regardless of whether a building is modular or\r\n  site-built, when it is moved, it loses its occupancy status.Â  When the building\r\n  reaches its destination, it receives a new occupancy status based upon its\r\n  purpose at the new location and must conform to the law applicable to its new\r\n  status.Â  Phipps identified Hoover's structure as modular rather than mobile by\r\n  the data plate attached to the building.Â  According to Phipps, modular homes\r\n  carry a data plate with a certificate permitting them to move &quot;anywhere in\r\n  the State of South Carolina.&quot;Â  In addition to naming different inspectors\r\n  who handled Hoover's construction project on the County's behalf, he testified\r\n  the County performed all its obligations in this matter &quot;to code and to\r\n  the letter.&quot;Â  \r\nThe\r\n  record includes a copy of a vehicular title issued by the State of South\r\n  Carolina to Easy Lifestyle, Inc., for a 1998-model vehicle.Â  The title lists\r\n  the vehicle's body style as &quot;MBH&quot; and its model as\r\n  &quot;28X60.&quot;Â  This description appears to fit a double-wide mobile home\r\n  measuring twenty-eight feet by sixty feet.Â  Phipps testified the vehicle\r\n  identification number from the title matched the number identifying Hoover's\r\n  modular structure on a plat of Hoover's property.Â  Hoover testified at his\r\n  deposition that he purchased a modular office building and placed it on the\r\n  lot, intending to convert it to a home.Â  Hoover denied knowing at the time of\r\n  purchase that the structure had previously been titled as a mobile home.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  October 30, 2008, the circuit court heard arguments on the County's motion for\r\n  summary judgment.[2]Â \r\n  The County argued summary judgment was appropriate because Appellants sought to\r\n  have the circuit court impermissibly substitute itself for the proper administrative\r\n  authority in a county regulatory matter and, alternatively, because Appellants\r\n  failed to identify a justiciable controversy.Â  In support of its second\r\n  argument, the County pointed to Appellants' concessions at the TRO hearing that\r\n  (1) the relief they sought in their motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction\r\n  was the same as the relief they sought in their Complaint and (2) they would\r\n  not suffer irreparable harm if the TRO were not issued.Â  In addition, the\r\n  County identified the 2007 issuance of the certificate of occupancy as an\r\n  intervening event that rendered Appellants' declaratory judgment case moot.Â Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  response, Appellants argued Hoover's modular office building was titled as a\r\n  mobile home, a structure not allowed by law to be installed in a flood hazard\r\n  area, and that the unit's foundation did not conform to code.Â  Appellants\r\n  challenged the validity of the certificate of occupancy in light of the facts\r\n  and contended a public body should not be able to avoid liability for\r\n  misconduct merely by issuing a certificate.Â  Finally, Appellants reasoned that\r\n  while an injunction against construction or issuance of a certificate of\r\n  occupancy might no longer be appropriate, they were entitled to other relief,\r\n  such as an order requiring Hoover's structure to comply with the law.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  April 1, 2009, the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of Hoover\r\n  and the County.Â  Specifically, the circuit court found the declaratory judgment\r\n  actions were moot because the County's subsequent grant of a certificate of\r\n  occupancy rendered Appellants' issues non-justiciable.Â  In addition, the\r\n  circuit court found Appellants were unable to demonstrate they would suffer\r\n  irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief and dismissed their\r\n  complaint with prejudice.Â  This appeal followed.Â  The County filed a brief, but\r\n  Hoover did not.Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court\r\n  applies the same standard that governs the circuit court under Rule 56(c),\r\n  SCRCP.Â  Englert, Inc. v. Netherlands Ins. Co., 315 S.C. 300, 302, 433\r\n  S.E.2d 871, 873 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  This standard requires all facts and\r\n  reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom to be viewed in the light most\r\n  favorable to the appellant.Â  Id.Â  &quot;Our\r\n  standard of review in evaluating a motion for summary judgment is to liberally\r\n  construe the record in favor of the nonmoving party and give the nonmoving\r\n  party the benefit of all favorable inferences that might reasonably be drawn\r\n  therefrom.&quot; Â Estes v. Roper Temp. Servs., Inc., 304 S.C. 120, 121,\r\n  403 S.E.2d 157, 158 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  &quot;An appellate court may decide questions of law with no particular\r\n  deference to the [circuit] court.&quot;Â  In re Campbell, 379 S.C. 593,\r\n  599, 666 S.E.2d 908, 911 (2008).Â  However, the courts accord &quot;great\r\n  deference . . . [to] the decisions of\r\n  those charged with interpreting and applying local zoning ordinances.&quot;Â  Eagle\r\n    Container Co. v. Cnty. of Newberry, 379 S.C. 564, 568, 666 S.E.2d 892, 894\r\n  (2008).Â  Nevertheless, in applying the preponderance of the evidence standard,\r\n  the nonmoving party is only required to &quot;submit a mere scintilla of\r\n  evidence in order to withstand a motion for summary judgment.&quot;Â  Hancock\r\n    v. Mid-South Mgmt. Co., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803 (2009).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Justiciable\r\n  Controversy\r\nWith regard to their claims for declaratory judgment, Appellants\r\n  contend the circuit court erred in concluding they failed to present a justiciable controversy because\r\n  an intervening event rendered their argument moot.Â  We agree but affirm the\r\n  circuit court on other grounds appearing in the record.Â  \r\nSummary\r\n  judgment is appropriate when &quot;the pleadings, depositions, answers to\r\n  interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\r\n  show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving\r\n  party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.&quot;Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  A\r\n  declaratory judgment issued in accordance with sections 15-53-10 through\r\n  15-53-140 of the South Carolina Code (2005 &amp; Supp. 2010) must comply with\r\n  the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  Rule 57, SCRCP.Â  &quot;The\r\n  existence of another adequate remedy does not preclude a judgment for\r\n  declaratory relief in cases where it is appropriate.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nGenerally,\r\n  appellate courts only consider &quot;cases presenting a justiciable\r\n  controversy.&quot;Â  Sloan v. Friends of Hunley, Inc., 369 S.C. 20, 25,\r\n  630 S.E.2d 474, 477 (2006).Â  According to our supreme court:Â  \r\n\r\n  A\r\n    justiciable controversy exists when there is a real and substantial controversy\r\n    which is appropriate for judicial determination, as distinguished from a\r\n    dispute that is contingent, hypothetical, or abstract. Â Â A moot case exists\r\n    where a judgment rendered by the court will have no practical legal effect upon\r\n    an existing controversy because an intervening event renders any grant of\r\n    effectual relief impossible for the reviewing court. Â If there is no actual\r\n    controversy, this Court will not decide moot or academic questions. \r\n\r\nId. at 25-26, 630 S.E.2d at 477.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  affirm the grant of summary judgment on other grounds appearing in the record.Â \r\n  &quot;The appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, decision or judgment\r\n  upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.&quot;Â  Rule 220(c),\r\n  SCACR.Â  In the case at bar, Appellants lacked standing to assert a claim\r\n  against Hoover and the County.Â  \r\n\r\n  Standing\r\n    refers to a party's right to make a legal claim or seek judicial enforcement of\r\n    a duty or right.Â  Generally, to have standing, a litigant must have a personal\r\n    stake in the subject matter of the litigation.Â  Standing is comprised of three\r\n    elements: (1) the plaintiff must have suffered an injury-in-fact that is\r\n    concrete and particularized, and actual and imminent as opposed to\r\n    hypothetical; (2) the injury and the conduct complained of the defendant must\r\n    be causally connected; and (3) it must be likely that the injury will be\r\n    redressed by a favorable decision.\r\n\r\nMichael P. v. Greenville\r\n  Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 385 S.C.\r\n  407, 415-16, 684 S.E.2d 211, 215 (Ct. App. 2009) (internal citations omitted).Â \r\n  Legal action may only be instituted by a person who has standing.Â  Sloan v.\r\n    Greenville Cnty., 356 S.C. 531, 547, 590 S.E.2d 338, 347 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\n\r\n  To have\r\n    standing, one must have a personal stake in the subject matter of the lawsuit.Â \r\n    To have standing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. one must be a real party in interest.Â  A real\r\n    party in interest is one who has a real, material, or substantial interest in\r\n    the subject matter of the action, as opposed to one who has only a nominal or\r\n    technical interest in the action.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 547-48, 590 S.E.2d at 347 (internal citations and\r\n  quotation marks omitted).Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find Appellants lack standing in this case because they have failed to prove an\r\n  injury-in-fact.Â  See Michael P., 385 S.C. at 415-16, 684 S.E.2d\r\n  at 215 (requiring an actual injury, a causal connection between the\r\n  complained-of action and the injury, and an ability by the court to redress the\r\n  injury with a favorable decision).Â  Appellants sought declaratory judgments holding\r\n  Hoover illegally cleared and graded his property, erected an unpermitted office\r\n  trailer, improperly placed sewer taps, failed to comply with permitting and setback requirements, and abused his\r\n  position as an employee of the County.Â  They sought a second declaratory\r\n  judgment against Hoover for his alleged fraudulent use of his property as his\r\n  primary residence for tax purposes.Â  They sought a third declaratory judgment\r\n  against him for his failures relating to subdividing his property.Â  In\r\n  addition, Appellants also sought a declaratory judgment against the County for\r\n  failing to inspect or investigate Hoover's development, failing to enforce\r\n  codes and ordinances, and affording Hoover preferential treatment in the\r\n  development of his property.Â  None of these sought-after declaratory judgments\r\n  identifies any injury to Appellants.Â  Furthermore, Appellants failed to produce\r\n  even a scintilla of evidence to support their allegations that the construction\r\n  activities on Hoover's lot damaged either their property values or their\r\n  enjoyment of the lake, which they acknowledged they do not own.Â  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  because Appellants failed to produce any evidence the County's or Hoover's\r\n  actions caused them to suffer an actual injury, they are unable to satisfy\r\n  either of the remaining elements of standing.Â  Id.Â  Neither causation\r\n  nor redressability exists in the absence of an injury-in-fact because both\r\n  elements rely on the presence of the injury.Â  Without injury, causation is\r\n  merely action unconnected to any effect.Â  Without injury, redressability lacks\r\n  either an image by which to determine the nature of the appropriate remedy or a\r\n  quantity by which to measure how much remediation is due.Â  Consequently,\r\n  Appellants have failed to establish the requisite elements of standing, and\r\n  their claim is non-justiciable.Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Irreparable Harm\r\nNext,\r\n  with regard to their applications for injunctive relief, Appellants argue the\r\n  circuit court erred in concluding they failed to produce any evidence to show\r\n  they were irreparably harmed.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAppellate\r\n  courts review orders granting or denying injunctions for abuse of discretion. Â Cnty.\r\n    of Richland v. Simpkins, 348 S.C. 664, 668, 560 S.E.2d 902, 904 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\n  Â An abuse of discretion occurs when the circuit court enters a decision that is\r\n  either unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law. Â Id.\r\nAn\r\n  injunction is equitable in nature and will only be granted when no adequate\r\n  remedy exists at law.Â  Strategic Res. Co. v. BCS Life Ins. Co., 367 S.C.\r\n  540, 544, 627 S.E.2d 687, 689 (2006).Â  Moreover:Â  \r\n\r\n  The\r\n    party seeking an injunction has the burden of demonstrating facts and\r\n    circumstances warranting an injunction.Â  The remedy of an injunction is a\r\n    drastic one and ought to be applied with caution. Â In deciding whether to grant\r\n    an injunction, the court must balance the benefit of an injunction to the\r\n    plaintiff against the inconvenience and damage to the defendant, and grant an\r\n    injunction which seems most consistent with justice and equity under the\r\n    circumstances of the case. \r\n\r\nId. (internal citations omitted).Â  A preliminary\r\n  injunction is appropriate when the party seeking relief establishes that &quot;(1)\r\n  it would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted[,] (2) the\r\n  party seeking injunction will likely succeed in the litigation[,] and (3) there\r\n  is an inadequate remedy at law.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nWe\r\n  affirm the circuit court's grant of summary judgment and denial of injunctive\r\n  relief on the basis that Appellants failed to produce even a scintilla of\r\n  evidence that they were irreparably harmed.Â  Appellants argue they are\r\n  &quot;qualified&quot; to testify that Hoover's construction project has\r\n  diminished the value of their respective properties.Â  Assuming their statement\r\n  is correct, they failed to testify to any diminution in value.Â  Dempsey\r\n  testified he had a gut feeling erosion from Hoover's lot negatively affected\r\n  the value of his property.Â  Blue testified he also believed Hoover's activities\r\n  devalued his property.Â  In addition, Dempsey testified the erosion from\r\n  Hoover's property was damaging the water quality of the cove and adversely\r\n  affecting his pleasure in using the lake.Â  Blue testified he believed the\r\n  sediment eroded from Hoover's land would deposit in the cove that he and his\r\n  neighbors had dredged some years before and would eventually limit his access\r\n  to the lake.[3]Â \r\n  However, the record includes no testimony concerning the value of their properties\r\n  prior to Hoover's construction project, the amount of depreciation they\r\n  attributed to Hoover's construction activities, or any actual impact Hoover's\r\n  project has had upon the enjoyment of their properties.Â  Moreover,Â  Dempsey did\r\n  not present any evidence that Hoover's construction project adversely impacted\r\n  the value of his property.Â  With not even a scintilla of evidence of any\r\n  diminishment in property values, Appellants' testimonies failed to establish\r\n  irreparable harm to their properties.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court did not\r\n  abuse its discretion in denying them injunctive relief or in granting summary\r\n  judgment to Hoover and the County.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the evidence in the record supports a finding that Appellants\r\n  lack standing to seek a declaratory judgment against Hoover and the County.Â  On\r\n  that ground, we affirm the circuit court's conclusion that Appellants' claims\r\n  for declaratory judgment are non-justiciable.Â  \r\nIn addition, we find the circuit court correctly denied Appellants\r\n  injunctive relief because they failed to present even a scintilla of evidence demonstrating\r\n  irreparable harm.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J., SHORT, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Judge James R. Barber denied the temporary\r\n  injunction.Â Â Â  \r\n[2] Judge L. Casey Manning granted summary judgment.Â  \r\n[3] However, both Dempsey and Blue conceded they did not\r\n  own the lake or the portion of the cove in which they contend sediment was\r\n  accumulating.Â  Moreover, this testimony amounted to pure speculation.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-112","title":"Myles v.

McMullen Taylor and Charles\r\n          O. Williams, III, Â all of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: James L. Myles, III, appeals the circuit court's order\r\n  granting summary judgment to Main-Waters Enterprises, LLC and Main-Waters\r\n  Management, Inc. (Main-Waters).Â  Myles argues the circuit court erred in ruling\r\n  (1) Myles was unable to establish a prima facie case of defamation, (2) Myles\r\n  failed to establish a claim for false arrest, and (3) Myles failed to establish\r\n  a claim of negligence.Â  We affirm[1] on all three points.Â Â Â  \r\nFACTS / PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThis appeal arises\r\n  out of a physical altercation that occurred in a McDonald's restaurant parking\r\n  lot in Orangeburg, South Carolina.Â  On the night of the incident, Myles left a\r\n  local bar with his fiancÃ©e, Wendy Summers,[2] and another couple.Â  All four rode together in a Ford Explorer. Â The\r\n  other couple, Scott Dyches and his wife Julie Jackson, began arguing while\r\n  riding in the Explorer.Â  At some point during the argument, Scott exited the\r\n  Explorer and began walking along the side of the road.Â  Jackson then called\r\n  Michael Dyches, Scott's father, to come and pick Scott up.\r\nAfter Michael\r\n  picked up his son Scott, a fight ensued between the father and son regarding\r\n  whether Scott should continue to stay out or go home.Â  Michael pulled into the\r\n  McDonald's parking lot where Myles, Jackson, and Summers were waiting in the\r\n  drive-thru line to pick up their food.Â  When Scott saw his wife, he stood up in\r\n  the seat of his father's Ford Mustang convertible and began yelling.Â  Michael\r\n  &quot;popped&quot; Scott either on his leg or in his stomach, and the father\r\n  and son began to physically fight.Â  Witnesses testified Scott was on top of\r\n  Michael choking him, while Michael lay pinned between the bucket seats of his\r\n  convertible.Â  Myles exited the Explorer and pulled Scott out of the convertible\r\n  to break up the fight.[3]\r\nOfficer Robert Hill\r\n  was the first to respond to the incident, and he encountered Scott running\r\n  along Highway 301 near the McDonald's.Â  Officer Hill noted Scott appeared\r\n  disheveled and intoxicated.Â  Scott admitted to being involved in an altercation\r\n  with his father at McDonald's.Â  Officer Hill proceeded to the McDonald's and\r\n  continued to interview Scott and Michael Dyches.[4]Â \r\n  Michael Dyches also appeared disheveled and intoxicated.Â  Once both father and\r\n  son admitted to fighting outside of the McDonald's, Officer Hill arrested both\r\n  men.\r\nWhen\r\n  asked if anyone else was involved in the fight, Scott told Officer Hill that he\r\n  saw Myles &quot;coming towards him&quot; and then &quot;his eyes went\r\n  closed&quot; before he was beaten about the face and head.Â  Officer Hill noted\r\n  Scott did not actually see Myles hit him.Â  Officer Hill interviewed Myles after\r\n  arresting the Dyches.Â  According to Myles, he saw the Dyches fighting and\r\n  &quot;went and started trying to break them up.&quot;Â  Officer Hill noted\r\n  Myles's account was consistent with Michael Dyches's account, and Scott was\r\n  unsure if Myles was actively involved in the fight or not.Â  Therefore, Officer\r\n  Hill did not intend to arrest Myles based solely on Scott's account of the\r\n  incident.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  some point during the police investigation, an unidentified McDonald's employee[5] called Officer Hill over to the drive-thru window and informed him that Myles\r\n  was also involved in the altercation.Â  The employee's account varied\r\n  significantly from the other witnesses' accounts.Â  Specifically, the young\r\n  woman told Officer Hill that Michael and Myles drove up in a red convertible,\r\n  approached the Explorer where Scott was waiting in the drive-thru line, and\r\n  pulled him out of the vehicle and began beating him.Â  Officer Hill testified that\r\n  on the night of the incident no one other than the unidentified McDonald's\r\n  employee told him Myles was actively involved in the fight.Â  However, Officer\r\n  Hill explained that drive-thru workers are &quot;some of your better witnesses\r\n  because they see everything, especially at 3 o'clock in the morning on Saturday\r\n  night they get cussed at more than we do.&quot;\r\nPrior\r\n  to speaking with the unidentified female employee, Officer Hill was prepared to\r\n  let Myles leave the scene as long as he did not drive.[6]Â \r\n  As a result of the young woman's account, however, the police decided to arrest\r\n  Myles for fighting, along with Scott and Michael.Â  Myles was initially calm as\r\n  the police began to handcuff him. Â However, Summers began screaming profanities\r\n  at the police and became visibly agitated when the arresting officers began to\r\n  handcuff Myles.Â  Upon seeing the officers forcibly detain Summers by leaning\r\n  her over the hood of a patrol car to handcuff her, Myles became enraged.Â  Myles\r\n  began yelling at the officers and physically resisting arrest, saying\r\n  &quot;that's a female.&quot;Â  One of the officers deployed his taser two times\r\n  on Myles,[7] and the police were able to handcuff Myles and place him in the back of a\r\n  patrol car.Â  \r\nMyles subsequently brought a lawsuit against the\r\n  entities that own and operate the McDonald's restaurant where this incident\r\n  occurred, namely, Main-Waters Enterprises, LLC, Main-Waters Management, Inc.,\r\n  and Main-Waters Enterprises Partnership, LLP.[8] Â Myles also sued the City of Orangeburg and the three Orangeburg Public Safety\r\n  Department officers who responded to the incident.[9]Â \r\n  Myles alleged slander, false arrest and imprisonment, and negligence against\r\n  all parties.Â  Myles claimed damage to his reputation as a result of the false\r\n  statement by a Main-Waters employee concerning Myles's involvement in the fight\r\n  between Michael and Scott Dyches, which resulted in Myles's allegedly unfounded\r\n  arrest by the City of Orangeburg.Â  Myles also claimed he suffered a serious and\r\n  permanent injury as a result of being tased, forcing him to retire and incur\r\n  $1,069,854 as a result of his loss of earning capacity.\r\nDuring\r\n  discovery, witness deposition testimony diverged regarding what happened after\r\n  Myles pulled Scott from the convertible.Â  Michael Dyches, Scott Dyches, Julie\r\n  Jackson (Scott's wife), Wendy Summers, and Myles all testified Myles's only\r\n  involvement in the altercation was pulling Scott out of the convertible and\r\n  away from Michael.Â  Letonya Jones, the McDonald's shift manager, testified she\r\n  saw all three men fighting, and she recalled seeing Myles punch at least one of\r\n  the other two men.Â  Asheria Shuler, another McDonald's employee, also testified\r\n  all three men were fighting and noted either Scott or Michael punched Myles as\r\n  he tried to break up the fight.\r\nFollowing\r\n  the completion of discovery, Main-Waters moved for summary judgment.Â  After a\r\n  hearing, the circuit court granted Main-Waters' motion for summary judgment on\r\n  all three claims.Â  Myles subsequently filed a timely motion to alter or amend,\r\n  which the circuit court summarily denied. Â This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis\r\n  court reviews the grant of a summary judgment motion under the same standard\r\n  applied by the circuit court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.&nbsp; Jackson v.\r\n    Bermuda Sands, Inc., 383 S.C. 11, 14 n.2, 677 S.E.2d 612, 614 n.2 (Ct. App.\r\n  2009).&nbsp; Rule 56(c), SCRCP, provides summary judgment shall be granted\r\n  where &quot;the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\r\n  admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\r\n  genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to\r\n  a judgment as a matter of law.&quot;&nbsp; \r\nIn\r\n  ascertaining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all\r\n  inferences that can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the\r\n  light most favorable to the non-moving party.&nbsp; Belton v. Cincinnati\r\n    Ins. Co., 360 S.C. 575, 578, 602 S.E.2d 389, 391 (2004).Â  &quot;[I]n cases\r\n  applying the preponderance of the evidence burden of proof, the non-moving\r\n  party is only required to submit a mere scintilla of evidence in order to\r\n  withstand a motion for summary judgment.&quot;Â  Hancock v. Mid-South Mgmt.\r\n    Co., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803&nbsp;(2009).\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n1. Did the circuit court err in\r\n  ruling Myles failed to establish a prima facie case of defamation?\r\n2. Did the circuit court err in\r\n  ruling Myles failed to establish a claim of false arrest?\r\n3. Did the circuit court err in\r\n  ruling Myles failed to establish a claim of negligence?\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI. Defamation\r\nMyles\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in finding the Main-Waters employee's statements\r\n  were &quot;substantially true.&quot;Â  We disagree.Â  The\r\n  truth of the matter published is a complete defense to an action based on\r\n  defamation.Â  Ross v. Columbia Newspapers, Inc., 266 S.C. 75, 80,\r\n  221 S.E.2d 770, 772&nbsp;(1976).Â  A sufficient\r\n  defense is made out where the evidence establishes that the statement was\r\n  substantially true.Â  Id.Â  &quot;It is not necessary to establish\r\n  the literal truth of the precise statement made.&quot;Â  Restatement (Second) of\r\n  Torts Â§ 581A (1977).Â  &quot;Slight inaccuracies of expression are immaterial\r\n  provided that the defamatory charge is true in substance.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nMyles\r\n  contends the employee's statement was false because he was not actually\r\n  fighting but merely intervened in a fight between Scott and Michael Dyches to\r\n  stop the fight.Â  However, during his deposition testimony, Myles\r\n  admitted that he &quot;just basically drag â€“ drug [Scott] out the car.&quot; Â In\r\n  addition, while riding in the patrol car after his arrest, Myles told one of\r\n  the arresting officers: &quot;I grabbed [Scott], I grabbed him and threw him\r\n  out of the car.&quot;\r\nThe circuit court\r\n  did not err in finding the employee's comment was substantially true.Â  Even\r\n  viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the non-movant, Myles admitted\r\n  to grabbing and throwing Scott out of a vehicle, which a casual observer could\r\n  reasonably view as engaging in a fight.Â  See Restatement (Second) of\r\n  Torts Â§ 581A (1977) (&quot;It is not necessary to establish the literal truth\r\n  of the precise statement made.&quot;).\r\nNext,\r\n  Myles argues the circuit court erred in ruling that the Main-Waters employee's\r\n  statements were qualifiedly privileged as statements made in the investigation\r\n  of a crime for the purpose of prosecuting criminals.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n&quot;In\r\n  a defamation action, the defendant may assert the affirmative defense of\r\n  conditional or qualified privilege.&quot;Â  Swinton Creek Nursery v. Edisto\r\n    Farm Credit, ACA,&nbsp;334 S.C. 469, 484, 514 S.E.2d 126, 134&nbsp;(1999).Â \r\n  &quot;Under this defense, one who publishes defamatory matter concerning another\r\n  is not liable for the publication if (1) the matter is published upon an\r\n  occasion that makes it conditionally privileged, and (2) the privilege is not\r\n  abused.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nIt\r\n  is the duty of the court to determine if the statement is privileged as a matter\r\n  of law.Â  Murray v. Thornton, 344 S.C. 129, 140, 542 S.E.2d 743, 749 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2001).Â  Communications made in the investigation of a crime for the\r\n  purpose of detecting the participants in the crime are privileged.Â  Bell v.\r\n    Bank of Abbeville, 208 S.C. 490, 494, 38 S.E.2d 641, 643 (1946); Switzer\r\n      v. Am. Ry. Express Co., 119 S.C. 237, 241, 112 S.E.110, 111 (1922).Â  \r\n&quot;Where\r\n  the occasion gives rise to a qualified privilege, there is a prima facie\r\n  presumption to rebut the inference of malice, and the burden is on the\r\n  plaintiff to show actual malice or that the scope of the privilege has been\r\n  exceeded.&quot;Â  Swinton Creek Nursery, 334 S.C. at 484-85, 514 S.E.2d\r\n  at 134.Â  While abuse of the conditional privilege is ordinarily an issue of\r\n  fact reserved for the jury, in the absence of a controversy as to the facts, it\r\n  is for the court to say whether or not the privilege has been abused or\r\n  exceeded.\r\n  Woodward v. S.C. Farm Bureau Ins. Co., 277 S.C. 29, 32-33, 282 S.E.2d\r\n  599, 601&nbsp;(1981) (internal citations omitted).Â  \r\nAbuse\r\n  of a conditional privilege may be shown by communication that exceeds what the\r\n  occasion demands.Â  Davis v. Niederhof, 246 S.C. 192, 199-200, 143 S.E.2d\r\n  367, 371&nbsp;(1965).Â  In addition, the privilege may also be overcome by a\r\n  showing of common law malice on the part of the alleged defamer.Â  Murray v.\r\n    Holnam, Inc., 344 S.C. 129, 142, 542 S.E.2d 743, 750&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001).Â \r\n  &quot;Common law actual malice means the defendant acted with ill will toward\r\n  the plaintiff or acted recklessly or wantonly, meaning with conscious\r\n  indifference toward the plaintiff's rights.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  Main-Waters established the privilege by showing that its employee reported\r\n  what she saw in the McDonald's parking lot on the night of the incident to an\r\n  officer of the Orangeburg Department of Public Safety during the course of his\r\n  investigation of a crime. Â Therefore, the burden shifted to Myles to\r\n  demonstrate the employee lacked good faith, or that the statement was made\r\n  maliciously.Â  See Swinton Creek Nursery, 334 S.C. at 484-85, 514\r\n  S.E.2d at 134.\r\nWe\r\n  do not believe Myles demonstrated any evidence of lack of good faith or malice\r\n  on the part of the unidentified Main-Waters employee.Â  Two other McDonald's\r\n  workers testified they saw all three men fighting.Â  In addition, there was no\r\n  evidence that the employee published her statement to anyone other than Officer\r\n  Hill.Â  Myles did not present any evidence to indicate the employee exceeded the\r\n  scope of the privilege.Â  Based on these facts, the circuit court did not err in\r\n  finding the employee's statement was privileged.Â  Therefore, no genuine issue\r\n  of material fact was in dispute with respect to the qualified privilege, and\r\n  summary judgment was appropriate.Â  \r\n Summary judgment\r\n  was appropriate because the employee's statement was made subject to a\r\n  qualified privilege, and the scope of that privilege was not abused.Â  In\r\n  addition, the statement was substantially true.Â  Therefore, no cause of action\r\n  for defamation can lie and we need not address the remaining arguments Myles\r\n  raises on appeal with respect to his defamation cause of action.Â  Futch v.\r\n    McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591,\r\n  598&nbsp;(1999) (noting an appellate court need not address remaining issues\r\n  when the resolution of a prior issue is dispositive).Â  \r\nII. False Arrest / Imprisonment\r\nMyles\r\n  contends he presented sufficient evidence to establish a cause of action for\r\n  false arrest or false imprisonment.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nTo\r\n  prevail on a claim for false imprisonment, a plaintiff must prove that the\r\n  defendant intentionally and unlawfully restrained the plaintiff.Â  Jones v. Winn-Dixie\r\n    Greenville, Inc., 318 S.C. 171, 175, 456 S.E.2d 429, 432 (Ct. App. 1995).Â \r\n  &quot;The charge of false imprisonment is not confined to the party who\r\n  unlawfully seizes or restrains another, but it likewise extends to any person\r\n  who may cause, instigate or procure an unlawful arrest.&quot;Â  Wingate v.\r\n    Postal Tel. &amp; Cable Co., 204 S.C. 520, 528, 30 S.E.2d 307,\r\n  311&nbsp;(1944).Â  &quot;[W]here a private person induces an officer by request,\r\n  direction or command to unlawfully arrest another, he is liable for false\r\n  imprisonment.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  &quot;[w]here a person merely directs the attention of a police\r\n  officer to what he supposes to be a [crime] . . . and the officer, without\r\n  other direction, arrests the offender on his own responsibility, the person who\r\n  did nothing more than communicate the facts to the officer is not liable for\r\n  causing the arrest . . . .&quot;Â  Id. at 527-28, 30 S.E.2d at 310-11.Â  In\r\n  addition, when a person is properly arrested by lawful authority, an action for\r\n  false arrest and imprisonment cannot be maintained.Â  Prosser v. Parsons,\r\n  245 S.C. 493, 501, 141 S.E.2d 342, 346 (1965).\r\nAn\r\n  officer can make an arrest for a misdemeanor not committed in his presence\r\n  &quot;when the facts and circumstances observed by the officer give him\r\n  probable cause to believe that a crime has been freshly committed.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Martin, 275 S.C. 141, 146, 268 S.E.2d 105, 107 (1980).Â  Probable cause\r\n  is a good faith belief that a person is guilty of a crime when the belief rests\r\n  on such grounds as would induce an ordinary, prudent, and cautious person under\r\n  the circumstances to believe likewise.Â  Gathers v. Harris Teeter\r\n    Supermarket, Inc., 282 S.C. 220, 228, 317 S.E.2d 748, 754 (Ct. App. 1984).Â \r\n  While the existence of probable cause is generally a question of fact for a\r\n  jury, the issue may be decided as a matter of law when the evidence yields but\r\n  one conclusion.Â  Parrott v. Plowden Motor Co., 246 S.C. 318, 323, 143\r\n  S.E.2d 607, 609 (1965).\r\nBecause the arrest was lawful, Myles cannot establish a cause of\r\n  action for false arrest or imprisonment.Â  See Prosser, 245 S.C.\r\n  at 501, 141 S.E.2d at 346.Â  Specifically, Myles admitted to Officer Hill that\r\n  when the Dyches started fighting he &quot;went and started trying to break them\r\n  up.&quot;Â  Scott told Officer Hill he could not be certain whether Myles hit\r\n  him, but that he saw Myles approaching him before he was hit in the face and\r\n  his eyes went black.Â  Scott had red marks on his chest and face when police\r\n  arrived, and his shirt was torn.Â  The physical evidence of a fight, in addition\r\n  to Scott's statement, Myles's own admission, and the unidentified Main-Waters\r\n  employee's comment that Myles was actively involved in the fight, combined to\r\n  give Officer Hill probable cause to arrest Myles.Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  the arresting officer had probable cause to arrest Myles, Main-Waters, as a\r\n  matter of law, is not liable for false arrest.Â  \r\nIII. Negligence\r\nMyles\r\n  argues the unidentified Main-Waters employee breached her duty of care by\r\n  making allegedly false statements to the police, thereby causing Myles to injure\r\n  his back when he was tased by the police.Â  Myles further contends the issue of\r\n  proximate cause is a disputed factual issue to be determined by a jury.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\n&quot;To establish\r\n  a cause of action for negligence a plaintiff must show . . . three essential\r\n  elements: (1) a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff; (2) a breach\r\n  of that duty by negligent act or omission; and (3) damage proximately resulting\r\n  from the breach of duty.&quot;Â  Trotter v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,\r\n  297 S.C. 465, 474, 377 S.E.2d 343, 348&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1988).Â  When an\r\n  intervening agency interrupts the foreseeable chain of events, the defendant's\r\n  acts are not the proximate cause.Â  Mellen v. Lane, 377 S.C. 261, 281,\r\n  659 S.E.2d 236, 246-47 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  Furthermore, when the evidence is\r\n  susceptible to only one inference, proximate cause may be decided as a matter\r\n  of law.Â  Vinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 402, 477 S.E.2d 715, 721-22\r\n  (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court correctly held that the superseding and intervening acts of\r\n  Myles, his fiancÃ©e, and the police served to break any causal chain connecting\r\n  the allegedly defamatory statement of the Main-Waters employee and any\r\n  resulting damages.Â  See Mellen, 377 S.C. at 281, 659 S.E.2d at\r\n  246-47.Â  Myles initially calmly consented to being arrested and only became\r\n  enraged after seeing the police detain his fiancÃ©e.Â  Once Myles began to\r\n  physically resist arrest and verbally abuse the police, the police deployed a\r\n  taser to incapacitate him.Â  Therefore, Myles's physical injuries did not\r\n  proximately result from the employee's comment, but instead from Myles's own actions\r\n  and those of his fiancÃ©e incidental to Myles being arrested.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  Myles provided no evidence that any of the Main-Waters employees deviated from\r\n  their training in reporting the fight to the police.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we affirm the circuit court's grant of summary judgment to Main-Waters on the\r\n  negligence cause of action.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  affirm the grant of summary judgment to Main-Waters on Myles's defamation, false\r\n  arrest / imprisonment, and negligence causes of action.\r\n THOMAS,\r\n  PIEPER, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Wendy Summers and James Myles were married after\r\n  these events, and Summers is now Wendy Myles.Â  We will refer to her as Summers\r\n  throughout this opinion for clarity and ease of reference.\r\n[3] While riding in the patrol car after his arrest,\r\n  Myles told one of the arresting officers: &quot;I grabbed [Scott], I grabbed\r\n  him and threw him out of the car.&quot;Â  Myles also admitted during his\r\n  deposition testimony that he &quot;just basically drag â€“ drug [Scott] out the\r\n  car.&quot;Â  \r\n[4] Presumably, Officer Hill transported Scott back to\r\n  the McDonald's in the backseat of his patrol car.Â  However, the record is\r\n  unclear on this point.Â  \r\n[5] During the summary judgment hearing, Main-Waters'\r\n  counsel noted a young woman named Constance Sweeper was probably the employee\r\n  police spoke to on the evening of the incident who indicated Scott was pulled\r\n  out of the Explorer by Michael and Myles.Â  However, the police were unable to\r\n  obtain a statement from Sweeper, and neither party was able to locate her in\r\n  order to take her deposition.Â  \r\n[6] Officer Hill testified both Summers and Myles\r\n  appeared to be intoxicated on the night of the incident.\r\n[7] Myles allegedly said &quot;it feels good&quot; after\r\n  being tased the first time, thereby inducing the officer to deploy his taser a\r\n  second time in order to incapacitate Myles.Â  \r\n[8] The parties agreed to dismiss Main-Waters Enterprises\r\n  Partnership, LLP, by stipulation of dismissal with prejudice on March 8, 2007,\r\n  as it was a nonexistent entity.\r\n[9] A May 14, 2007 circuit court order dismissed the\r\n  individually named officers as parties to this action based on the fact that\r\n  the officers were acting within the scope of their employment and based on the\r\n  fact that there was no allegation of fraud, malice, intent to harm, or a crime\r\n  of moral turpitude.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-113","title":"State v.

Â We reverse.[1]\r\nIn\r\n  criminal appeals from municipal court, the circuit court does not conduct a de\r\n  novo review. Â S.C. Code Ann.

John, Circuit Court Judge\r\nMonte L. Harrelson, Magistrate Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No.Â  2011-UP-115\r\n  Submitted February 1, 2011 â€“ Filed March\r\n22, 2011\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Brad R. Johnson, of Oak Island, North Carolina, pro se.\r\n        John L. Weaver, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  A magistrate court jury found Brad R. Johnson violated section 512 of Appendix\r\n  B of the Horry County Zoning Ordinance[1] designed to govern accessory buildings, structures, and their uses.Â  Johnson\r\n  appealed the verdict to the circuit court, and the circuit court affirmed.Â  Johnson now appeals the circuit court's order\r\n  affirming the magistrate court, arguing the circuit court erred in affirming\r\n  the magistrate court's (1) denial of his motion to dismiss based on a lack of\r\n  notice, (2) denial of his directed verdict motion, (3) exclusion of evidence\r\n  defining the term &quot;install,&quot; and (4) exclusion of a videotape\r\n  evidencing the State's disparate treatment of him.Â  We affirm.[2]\r\n1. With regard to the motion to dismiss, we find any\r\n  argument Johnson lacked notice is factually without merit.Â  Specifically, the\r\n  citation issued informed Johnson of the Horry County Zoning Ordinance he\r\n  allegedly violated as well as the possibility of being fined or imprisoned for\r\n  up to thirty days.Â  Further, any argument that the ordinance is\r\n  unconstitutionally vague is not preserved for review because it was not raised\r\n  to or ruled upon by the magistrate court.Â  See State v. Turner,\r\n  373 S.C. 121, 126 n.1, 644 S.E.2d 693, 696 n.1 (2007) (holding in order for an\r\n  issue to be preserved for review, it must be raised to and ruled upon by the\r\n  trial court).\r\n2. With regard to the directed verdict motion, we find\r\n  Johnson's admission in his appellate brief that his storage shed was placed\r\n  within six feet of his residence in and of itself supports the magistrate\r\n  court's submission of the case to the jury.Â  Therefore, we find neither the\r\n  magistrate nor the circuit court erred.Â  See State v. Weston, 367\r\n  S.C. 279, 292-93, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006) (stating if any direct evidence\r\n  reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused, the appellate court must\r\n  find the case was properly submitted to the jury).\r\n3. With regard to the exclusion of the definition of\r\n  &quot;install,&quot; Johnson failed to proffer the excluded evidence during\r\n  trial; therefore, this issue is not preserved for appellate review because this\r\n  court cannot determine whether he was prejudiced by the magistrate court's\r\n  exclusion.Â  See State v. Roper, 274 S.C. 14, 20, 260 S.E.2d 705,\r\n  708 (1979) (stating when no proffer of excluded testimony is made, the\r\n  appellate court is unable to determine whether the exclusion was prejudicial).\r\n4. With regard to the exclusion of the videotape, we find\r\n  the circuit court properly determined the magistrate court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion in excluding the videotape as irrelevant when it depicted Johnson's\r\n  neighbors' alleged ordinance violations that have no bearing on whether Johnson\r\n  violated the ordinance.Â  See State v. Aleksey, 343 S.C. 20, 35,\r\n  538 S.E.2d 248, 256 (2000) (stating the trial court is given broad discretion\r\n  in ruling on questions of relevance and that decision will not be reversed\r\n  absent a clear abuse of discretion); State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 208,\r\n  631 S.E.2d 262, 265 (2006) (stating an abuse of discretion arises when the\r\n  trial court's conclusions lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an\r\n  error of law).\r\nBased on the foregoing, the circuit court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW,\r\n  C.J., THOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Horry\r\n  County, S.C., Code of Ordinances Appendix B Zoning, art.

Â On appeal,\r\n  Piedmont argues the ALC erred when it determined Carolinas Healthcare Urgent\r\n  Care - Fort Mill (the Center) is &quot;the office of a licensed private\r\n  practitioner&quot; and is, therefore, exempt from certificate of need (CON)\r\n  review under S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-15 Â§ 104(2)(e) (Supp. 2010).Â  We withdrew our initial decision and\r\n  scheduled oral arguments.Â  \r\nPiedmont asserts\r\n  the ALC erred in granting summary judgment to CHS and CPN without allowing Piedmont\r\n  the opportunity to conduct discovery.[1]Â \r\n  We agree and conclude that the ALC erred in finding that it could resolve the\r\n  case as a matter of law by granting summary judgment without affording Piedmont\r\n  the opportunity to conduct discovery. See Dawkins v. Fields,&nbsp;354 S.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 439&nbsp;(2003) (&quot;Summary\r\n  judgment is a drastic remedy and must not be granted until the opposing party\r\n  has had a full and fair opportunity to complete discovery.&quot;); Lanham v.\r\n    Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of S.C., Inc.,&nbsp;349 S.C. 356, 363, 563\r\n  S.E.2d 331, 334&nbsp;(2002) (finding the court of appeals correctly reversed the\r\n  trial court's decision to rule on the summary judgment motion when Lanham was\r\n  not able to conduct further discovery to respond to Blue Cross's claim).Â  \r\nAdditionally, we disagree\r\n  with the Department's subject matter jurisdiction argument.Â  The Department\r\n  sought reconsideration of our initial opinion because it alleged there was no\r\n  decision rendered by the Department in this matter.Â  The record indicates that\r\n  there was a decision by the Department to exempt the Center from review.Â  For\r\n  example, in a letter from CHS to the Department dated December 19, 2007, CHS stated that the Department\r\n  provided notification that the Center was exempt from CON review.Â  Also, in a\r\n  letter dated February 13, 2009, from the Department, written to CHS and\r\n  Piedmont, the Department stated, &quot;[t]he S.C. Board of Health and\r\n  Environment Control decided on February 12, 2009, not to conduct a Final Review\r\n  Conference on the above-referenced matter.&quot;Â  Additionally, the subject\r\n  line of the letter states: &quot;Docket No. 09-RFR-06 â€“ Staff decision dated October 26, 2007 (mailed 1/7/2009) to approve an exemption (E-07-125) for\r\n  an expenditure by health care facility for a non-medical project.&quot;\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  Furthermore, included in the same letter is the following\r\n  reference to section 44-1-60(F) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010):Â \r\n  &quot;[I]f a final review conference is not conducted within sixty days, the\r\n  department decision becomes the final agency decision, and an applicant,\r\n  permittee, licensee, or affected person requests . . . a contested case hearing\r\n  before the Administrative Law Court.&quot; (emphasis added).Â Â  \r\nTherefore, we\r\n  reverse the judgment and remand to the ALC pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the\r\n  following authorities to allow discovery to be conducted and completed: S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(B)(d) (Supp. 2010) (&quot;The court of appeals may . . .\r\n  remand the case for further proceedings; or, it may reverse or modify the\r\n  decision if the substantive rights of the petitioner have been prejudiced\r\n  because the finding, conclusion, or decision is . . . affected by other error\r\n  of law . . . .&quot;); S.C.

Elliott, and Assistant\r\n          Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; and Solicitor Barry\r\n          Barnette, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Jonathan Vick appeals his conviction for threatening a\r\n  public official, arguing the trial court erred in denying his directed verdict\r\n  motion. We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  April 30, 2006, Vick blocked the hatch on his cell door when Officer Derrick\r\n  Jefferson Green opened the hatch to give Vick his food at the Spartanburg\r\n  County Detention Center (the Detention Center).Â  Then, Corporal Alvin Jennings,\r\n  Jr. opened the cell door in order to stop Vick from blocking the hatch.Â \r\n  Jennings and Vick became involved in an altercation during which Vick yelled, &quot;I'm\r\n  going to kill you and your f***ing family.&quot;Â  Vick was charged with\r\n  assaulting a local correctional employee and threatening the life of a public\r\n  official.Â  At trial, Vick moved for a directed verdict on the threatening a\r\n  public official charge, arguing the State failed to prove Jennings was a public\r\n  official, which the trial court denied.Â  The jury found Vick guilty of both charges.Â \r\n  The trial court sentenced Vick to a three-year sentence for assaulting a local\r\n  correctional employee and a concurrent three-year sentence for threatening the\r\n  life of a public official.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nJonathan\r\n  Vick argues the trial court erred in denying his directed verdict motion\r\n  because the State failed to prove Jennings was a public official.Â  We disagree. \r\n&quot;A defendant\r\n  is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to present evidence of the\r\n  offense charged.&quot;Â  State v. Heath, 370 S.C. 326, 329, 635 S.E.2d\r\n  18, 19 (2006).Â  &quot;If there is any direct evidence or substantial\r\n  circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused,\r\n  [the appellate court] must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.&quot;Â  State v. Stanley, 365 S.C. 24, 42, 615\r\n  S.E.2d 455, 464 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  &quot;When ruling on a motion for a\r\n  directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence or\r\n  nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.&quot;Â  State v. Weston, 367\r\n  S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648&nbsp;(2006).Â  &quot;The\r\n  State has the burden of proof as to all the essential elements of the crime.&quot;Â  State v. Brannon, 388 S.C. 498, 502, 697 S.E.2d 593, 596&nbsp;(2010). Â &quot;When\r\n  reviewing a denial of a directed verdict, this Court views the evidence and all\r\n  reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the state.&quot;Â  Weston,\r\n  367 S.C. at 292, 625 S.E.2d at 648.Â  \r\n A person is guilty\r\n  of threatening a public official when he &quot;knowingly and willfully . . .\r\n  deliver[s] or convey[s] to a public official . . . [a] verbal . . .\r\n  communication which contains a threat to take the life of or to inflict bodily\r\n  harm upon the public official . . .Â  or members of his\r\n  immediate family if the threat is directly related to the public official's . .\r\n  .Â  responsibilities.&quot;Â Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-1040(A) (2003).Â  A\r\n  public official is &quot;an elected or appointed official of the United States\r\n  or of this State or of a county, municipality, or other political subdivision\r\n  of this State.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-1040(E)(1) (2003).Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  evidence exists showing Jennings was a public official because he was appointed\r\n  by the department head of the Spartanburg County jails and detention centers. Â See Spartanburg, S.C., Code Â§ 46-32 (1994) (authorizing the department head of\r\n  Spartanburg County jails and detention centers to appoint officers for the\r\n  operation of the jails and detention centers). Â Furthermore, Jennings, as a detention\r\n  officer, has a similar status to a deputy appointed by the sheriff.Â  See Spartanburg, S.C., Code Â§ 46-47 (1994) (stating the officers appointed by the\r\n  department head of the Spartanburg County jails and detention centers will have\r\n  similar powers and duties as deputies appointed by the sheriff).\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we find the trial court did not err in denying Vick's motion for a directed\r\n  verdict.Â Â  For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court isÂ  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, SHORT, and\r\n  PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-117","title":"State v.

As to whether the\r\n  circuit court abused its discretion by denying Morrow's motion for a\r\n  continuance: State v. Ravenell,Â  387 S.C. 449, 455, 692 S.E.2d 554, 557 (Ct.

Â§ 15-3-530(1) (2005) (stating the statute of limitations for an action\r\n  upon a contract, obligation, or liability is three years); Rule 56(c), SCRCP\r\n  (The trial court should grant summary judgment &quot;if the pleadings,\r\n  depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with\r\n  the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material\r\n  fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law&quot;); Cothran v.

Blitch, Jr., all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Thomas Simmons appeals his commitment to\r\n  the South Carolina Department of Mental Health as a sexually violent predator.Â \r\n  On appeal, Simmons contends the trial court erred in denying his motion for a\r\n  directed verdict because the State failed to prove an element of the Sexually\r\n  Violent Predator Act (the Act) and in allowing the opinion testimony of a\r\n  non-expert into evidence.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\n1. The\r\n  trial court did not err in denying Simmons's motion for a directed verdict.Â  \r\nA sexually\r\n  violent predator is defined in the Act as &quot;a person who (a) has been\r\n  convicted of a sexually violent offense; and (b) suffers from a mental\r\n  abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in\r\n  acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility for long-term\r\n  control, care, and treatment.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(1) (Supp. 2010).Â \r\n  &quot;Mental abnormality&quot; is defined as &quot;a mental condition affecting\r\n  a person's emotional or volitional capacity that predisposes the person to\r\n  commit sexually violent offenses.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(3) (Supp.\r\n  2010).Â  The phrase &quot;likely to engage in acts of sexual violence&quot; is\r\n  defined as a &quot;propensity to commit acts of sexual violence . . . of such a\r\n  degree as to pose a menace to the health and safety of others.&quot;Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(9) (Supp. 2010).Â  &quot;When\r\n  ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with\r\n  the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.&quot;Â  State v.\r\n    Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006).Â  When reviewing a\r\n  denial of a directed verdict, an appellate court views the evidence and all\r\n  reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the State.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe State produced evidence\r\n  that Simmons met both elements of &quot;sexually violent predator&quot; as\r\n  defined in the Act.Â  Simmons met the first element of the Act because he was\r\n  adjudicated delinquent as a result of the commission of first-degree criminal\r\n  sexual conduct with a minor after he committed sexual battery on his\r\n  step-nephew.Â  Simmons met the second element of &quot;sexually violent\r\n  predator&quot; under the Act because the chief psychologist at the South\r\n  Carolina Violent Predator Program testified Simmons suffers from a mental\r\n  abnormality called sexual sadism, which he opined was a chronic condition. The\r\n  State presented evidence sufficient for a jury to find Simmons was likely to\r\n  &quot;engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility\r\n  for long-term control, care, and treatment,&quot; including: Simmons continued\r\n  to have vivid sexual fantasies involving rape, force and sadistic behavior\r\n  while committed; Simmons lapsed in his sex&#8209;offender treatment; while\r\n  committed, Simmons downloaded pornographic cartoons depicting rape and\r\n  violence; Simmons accumulated thirty disciplinary infractions while committed,\r\n  including fashioning a weapon and displaying signs of aggression toward other\r\n  juveniles and staff members; Simmons refused to pay restitution to his victim,\r\n  blamed the victim for his commitment, and believed the victim should have to\r\n  &quot;pay for me&quot;; and Simmons stated he &quot;was always listening to the\r\n  wrong voice.&quot;Â  Thus, viewing the\r\n  evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the evidence supports\r\n  submitting the case to the jury.Â  \r\n2. The trial court did\r\n  not err in allowing the social worker to testify about her personal\r\n  observations of Simmons.Â  \r\nLay witnesses are permitted\r\n  to offer &quot;testimony in the form of opinions or inferences&quot; if the\r\n  opinions or inferences &quot;(a) are rationally based on the perception of the\r\n  witness, (b) are helpful to a clear understanding of the witness'[s] testimony\r\n  or the determination of a fact in issue, and (c) do not require special\r\n  knowledge, skill, experience, or training.&quot;Â  Rule 701, SCRE.Â  &quot;Conclusions\r\n  or opinions of laymen should be rejected only when they are superfluous in the\r\n  sense that they will be of no value to the jury.&quot;Â  State v. Williams,\r\n  321 S.C. 455, 463, S.E.2d 49, 54 (1996).Â  \r\nThe State presented evidence\r\n  the social worker's testimony was based on her perception.Â  The question that\r\n  was objected to, which she answered, asked whether she had personally observed\r\n  Simmons display certain features.Â  Her answer was helpful to the determination\r\n  of the fact in issue of whether Simmons was likely to engage in acts of sexual\r\n  violence if not confined in a secure facility for long-term control, care, and\r\n  treatment.Â  Lastly, her personal observations did not require special\r\n  knowledge, skill, experience, or training.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the trial court\r\n  did not err in allowing the social worker to testify.

Hicks\r\n  (Husband) argues the family court (1) failed to make adequate findings of fact\r\n  for effective appellate review and possible future actions for modification,\r\n  (2) erred in awarding Jeanette L. Hicks (Wife) alimony of $1,270 per month, (3)\r\n  erred in admitting testimony regarding certain medical bills and awarding Wife\r\n  funds from the marital estate to pay them because she did not provide the bills\r\n  in response to his discovery requests, and (4) erred in requiring him to pay\r\n  one-half of the cost of preparing a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO).Â \r\n  We affirm.[1]\r\n1. Husband first argues\r\n  the family court's findings of fact in the appealed order were insufficient to\r\n  enable effective appellate review and to provide an adequate baseline for\r\n  comparison in the event of a future action for modification.Â  He further\r\n  complains that although he raised this concern in a Rule 59 motion, the family\r\n  court dismissed this motion summarily without oral argument or further\r\n  briefing.Â  We find no merit to either of these arguments.Â  \r\nThe divorce\r\n  decree includes findings that Husband was able-bodied and gainfully employed.Â \r\n  In the decree, the family court also stated his monthly income from his\r\n  employment and his social security benefits.Â  The court further acknowledged\r\n  Husband had health problems, but found these problems did not interfere with\r\n  his employment.Â  In addition, the court noted the amount Wife was receiving in\r\n  social security benefits and found she had health problems that prevented her\r\n  from working.Â  We hold these findings of fact are sufficient for both effective\r\n  appellate review and an adequate basis for comparison in the event that either\r\n  party requests a modification due to change of circumstances.Â  \r\nAs to the family\r\n  court's decision to dispense with both oral arguments and briefs before ruling\r\n  on Husband's Rule 59 motion, we find no abuse of discretion.Â  See Pollard\r\n    v. County of Florence, 314 S.C. 397, 402, 444 S.E.2d 534, 536 (Ct. App.\r\n  1994) (holding that even though the appellant did not style her motion as a\r\n  brief, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying the\r\n  appellant's motion to alter or amend the judgment without first conducting a\r\n  hearing).Â  Similar to the motion in Pollard, Husband's motion was seven\r\n  single-spaced typewritten pages long, set forth arguments on the issues raised,\r\n  and gave citations to legal authority; therefore, it was the functional\r\n  equivalent of a brief, and we hold the family court was not required to hold\r\n  oral argument or request additional written submissions before deciding the\r\n  motion.\r\n2. Regarding the alimony\r\n  award, Husband argues the family court (1)Â  failed to make the necessary\r\n  findings of fact required by statute, including his retirement, Wife's\r\n  allegedly voluntary decision to retire, the parties' standard of living, potential\r\n  rental income from Wife's nonmarital real property, and his health complaints;\r\n  (2) in computing his gross monthly income, failed to give adequate attention to\r\n  the fact that his work as a painter was conditioned on the weather and the\r\n  possibility that illness and hospitalization could result in loss of income;\r\n  (3) placed undue emphasis on his marital misconduct; and (4) should have\r\n  applied some portion of Wife's retirement account to her support.Â  We find no\r\n  abuse of discretion.Â  See Degenhart v. Buriss, 360 S.C. 497, 500,\r\n  360 S.E.2d 96, 97 (Ct. App. 2004) (&quot;Questions concerning alimony rest\r\n  within the sound discretion of the family court judge whose conclusion will not\r\n  be disturbed absent a showing of abuse of discretion.&quot;).\r\nAs previously\r\n  noted, the family court made adequate findings of fact about the parties'\r\n  respective abilities to work.Â  To the extent the court's other findings of fact\r\n  regarding the alimony award were deficient, we hold, as Husband himself\r\n  concedes in his brief, the alimony award had adequate support in the record.Â  See Holcombe v. Hardee, 304 S.C. 522, 524, 405 S.E.2d 821, 822 (1991)\r\n  (allowing the appellate court to make its own findings of fact if the record is\r\n  sufficient even though the family court may have failed to set forth specific\r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law to support its decision).Â  \r\nAlthough his\r\n  ability to find painting jobs was at times dependent on the weather, Husband\r\n  admitted he could work in inclement conditions if indoor work was available.Â  Moreover,\r\n  it is apparent from the decree that the family court viewed Husband's adultery\r\n  as a factor in only the divorce itself and Wife's entitlement to alimony but\r\n  not in the specific amount of spousal support awarded.Â  The family court, in\r\n  determining the amount of the award, considered the parties' incomes and\r\n  expenses, their prior work histories, and wife's role as primary caretaker of\r\n  the parties' three children.Â  It is also clear from the record that Wife's\r\n  nonmarital real property has no sewer line or septic tank and, as the family\r\n  court opined during the hearing, was unlikely to generate significant income\r\n  without significant expense.Â  Finally, Husband made only a conclusory argument\r\n  to support his assertion that the family court should have applied a portion of\r\n  Wife's retirement account to her support; therefore, we hold he has abandoned\r\n  this issue on appeal.Â  See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C.\r\n  361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (deeming the appellant to have abandoned\r\n  an issue because he failed to provide arguments or supporting authority for his\r\n  assertion and stating &quot;[m]ere allegations are not sufficient to\r\n  demonstrate an abuse of discretion&quot;).\r\n3. Husband next argues\r\n  the family court erred in admitting testimony about certain medical bills, in\r\n  failing to make sufficient findings about them, and in awarding Wife funds from\r\n  the marital estate to pay them.Â  He\r\n  claims he was unaware that the medical bills were an issue because they were\r\n  never listed on Wife's financial declaration or provided to him during\r\n  discovery.Â  Although Wife's attorney produced the bills during mediation, one\r\n  of his objections to their admissibility was the very fact that they were\r\n  communications during mediation and the agreement to mediate prohibited their\r\n  introduction during the final hearing.Â  Finally, he asserts that the late\r\n  disclosure of these billsâ€”on the financial declaration Wife provided to the\r\n  court the day of the final hearingâ€”prevented him from asserting various defenses,\r\n  including (1) that some of the bills were for expenses incurred by Wife after\r\n  the date of filing of her divorce action, (2) that the statute of limitations\r\n  may have expired on some of the expenses, and (3) that the medical providers\r\n  may have been willing to compromise on some of the expenses for less than their\r\n  face value.Â  We find no merit to any of these arguments.\r\nWe hold the very fact that\r\n  Husband was made aware of these bills during the mediation is a valid factor to\r\n  support a determination that the family court acted within its discretion in\r\n  allowing evidence that these expenses were incurred during the marriage.Â  SeeÂ  State v. Morris, 376 S.C. 189, 205, 656 S.E.2d 359, 368 (2008)\r\n  (&quot;The admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion\r\n  of the trial court, and the court's decision will not be reversed absent an\r\n  abuse of discretion.&quot;) (quoted in Â S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v.\r\n    Lisa C., 380 S.C. 406, 411, 669 S.E.2d 647, 650 (Ct. App. 2008)).Â  Furthermore,\r\n  the Alternative Dispute Resolution Rules do not expressly restrict the\r\n  admission of evidentiary material provided during mediation if that material\r\n  was not created solely for the mediation.Â  See Rule 7(b)(3), ADR\r\n  (authorizing a mediator to &quot;define and describe&quot; &quot;[t]he\r\n  inadmissibility of conduct and statements as evidence in any arbitral, judicial\r\n  or other proceeding&quot;); Rule 8(a), ADR (&quot;Communications during\r\n  a mediation settlement conference shall be confidential.&quot;) (emphasis\r\n  added); Rule 8(a)(5), ADR (prohibiting the reliance on or introduction as\r\n  evidence in any proceeding &quot;[a]ll records, reports or other documents created\r\n    solely for use in the mediation&quot;) (emphasis added).\r\nWe further reject Husband's\r\n  arguments that he was unfairly deprived of the opportunity to assert certain\r\n  defenses to having these expenses paid from marital funds because he did not\r\n  receive adequate notice that Wife would make this request at trial.Â  The family\r\n  court expressly found on the record that most if not all the bills were\r\n  incurred before the parties separated, Wife testified that any medical expenses\r\n  she incurred after the parties separated were not included among the bills she\r\n  sought to have paid from marital funds, and Husband had the opportunity\r\n  to cross-examine her on this point.Â  Although Husband's Rule 59 motion\r\n  mentioned the possibility that some of the expenses could have been time-barred\r\n  or subject to compromise by the providers, he did not raise these concerns at\r\n  trial and has therefore not preserved them for appeal.Â  See Hickman\r\n    v. Hickman, 301 S.C. 455, 456, 392 S.E.2d 481, 482 (Ct. App. 1990) (&quot;A\r\n  party cannot use Rule 59(e) to present to the court an issue the party could\r\n  have raised prior to judgment but did not.&quot;) (cited in C.A.H. v.\r\n    L.H., 315 S.C. 389, 392, 434 S.E.2d 268, 270 (1993)).\r\nWilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (holding an\r\n  objection must be sufficiently specific to inform the trial court of the point\r\n  being urged by the objector).\r\n\r\n4. Finally, Husband argues the family\r\n  court erred in ordering the parties to split the cost of preparing the QDRO.Â \r\n  He argues (1) the responsibility for preparing a QDRO is traditionally\r\n  delegated to the party who stands to benefit from the order and (2) the\r\n  requirement that he pay one-half of the attorney's fees for preparing the QDRO\r\n  is tantamount to an award of attorney's fees and thus contrary to the family\r\n  court's ruling that the issue of attorney's fees would be held in abeyance.Â  Wife\r\n  did not address these arguments in her brief; however, based on our review of\r\n  the matter, we affirm the family court's mandate that the parties should share\r\n  equally the costs of preparing the QDRO.Â Â  \r\n&quot;The award of attorney's\r\n  fees is left to the discretion of the trial judge and will only be disturbed\r\n  upon a showing of abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  Upchurch v. Upchurch, 367\r\n  S.C. 16, 28, 624 S.E.2d 643, 648 (2006).Â  Although the fees at issue here had\r\n  not yet been incurred when the family court issued the appealed order, Husband\r\n  in his brief acknowledges they are &quot;an effective award of attorney's\r\n  fees.&quot;Â  \r\nIn support of his position\r\n  Husband argues: &quot;The attorney for the alternate payee ordinarily prepares\r\n  the QDRO.&quot;Â  This assertion, however, comes from a practitioner's manual[2] and merely reflects the practical reality that the party who stands to benefit\r\n  from the QDRO has the greater incentive to avoid delay in the drafting and\r\n  approval of the document. Â Â Husband has not directed our attention to any\r\n  authority indicating that an alternate payee can never recover attorney's fees\r\n  incurred in preparing a QDRO from the opposing party or that it is an abuse of\r\n  discretion for the family court to order a plan participant to share the costs\r\n  of preparing a QDRO.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTHOMAS,\r\n  PIEPER, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  The authority Husband cited was The Attorney's\r\n  Handbook on Qualified Domestic Relations Orders by John H.

Turner, and Scott Hollingsworth, d/b/a Hollingsworth Rentals,\r\n  LLC, wherein the trial judge determined Donald R. Groce failed, as a matter of\r\n  law, to present evidence entitling him to prevail on any of his claims arising\r\n  from the sale of his mobile home at a delinquent tax sale.Â  Groce appeals\r\n  asserting the trial court erred in (1) granting a directed verdict to Horry\r\n  County in reliance on sections 12-51-40 and 31-17-320(A) of the South Carolina\r\n  Code, where Groce properly complied with DMV mobile home application\r\n  requirements for obtaining a certificate of title, (2) granting a directed\r\n  verdict on the issue of damages in reliance on section 15-78-60(11) of the\r\n  South Carolina Code when there was evidence of record the County failed to\r\n  comply with the requirements of section 12-51-40(c), and (3) granting a\r\n  directed verdict in Respondents' favor when the record shows the interest sold\r\n  by the County was not that owned by the owner of record at the time of the\r\n  sale.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThis action arises from the\r\n  sale of Groce's mobile home for delinquent taxes for tax year 2003, which were\r\n  incurred prior to Groce's purchase of the mobile home from SouthTrust Bank.[2]Â \r\n  Groce sought to set aside the tax sale and resulting tax deed, asserting the\r\n  Delinquent Tax Collector failed to comply with the mandatory statutory\r\n  requirements of section 21-51-40 of the South Carolina Code.Â  Groce also\r\n  asserted a cause of action for negligence against Horry County, the Horry\r\n  County Treasurer, the Delinquent Tax Manager, and the DMV.\r\nThe matter came before a jury\r\n  on September 15 and 16, 2008. Â The record reveals Groce purchased the 1995\r\n  General Mobile Home for $6,875.00 in April 2004.Â  Ronald Godbey was the\r\n  previous owner of the mobile home.Â  On May 18, 2004, Groce applied with the DMV\r\n  for a Certificate of Title and Registration for the mobile home. Â Groce, who\r\n  purchased the mobile home as a vacation home, included in the application to\r\n  the DMV the physical address of the mobile home as the residence address, that\r\n  being Shell Cove Mobile Home Park, 600 Highway 15 Lot 11, Myrtle Beach, SC\r\n  29577.Â  However, Groce listed his home address of 4948 U.S. Highway 21,\r\n  Hamptonville, NC 27020 as his mailing address on the DMV application.Â  The\r\n  Certificate of Title was issued to Groce on June 7, 2004, and included only the\r\n  address for the physical location of the mobile home in Myrtle Beach.[3] Groce testified that the County sold his mobile home for back taxes, but he\r\n  never received a tax bill on the property, never saw a notice of levy on the\r\n  property, never saw an advertisement for the sale of his property, and never\r\n  received any notice of a right of redemption on the property.Â  It is undisputed\r\n  that, although Groce registered for and received title to the mobile home from the\r\n  state DMV office, Groce never registered the mobile home with Horry County.\r\nPeggy Fouty, the manager of\r\n  titles and registration at the DMV, stated that the physical location of the\r\n  mobile home is the address required to be on the actual title issued for the\r\n  mobile home.Â  Fouty further testified the title history of a mobile home\r\n  registered with the DMV is available to those who qualify for the information.Â \r\n  According to Fouty, a title history submitted into evidence for this mobile\r\n  home showed Ronald Godbey first owned the home, followed by Donald Groce, then\r\n  Hollingsworth Rentals, and finally, Wiley Turner.Â  Additionally, the title history\r\n  showed a mailing address for Donald Groce at 4948 U.S. Highway 21,\r\n  Hamptonville, NC.[4]Â \r\n  While Fouty agreed the title history on this mobile home would be available to\r\n  Horry County, as Horry County would qualify for the information, the County\r\n  would have had to fill out an application to obtain the title history.Â  Fouty\r\n  further testified, though Horry County may have access to the DMV's Phoenix\r\n  system database, the information would be limited, and she could not state what\r\n  access Horry County would have, as each county's technology is different.Â Â \r\n  Further, back in 2005, county access would have been even more limited to the\r\n  DMV's mobile home records, as the information available to the counties had\r\n  evolved over the years.\r\nCrystal Montgomery, the\r\n  Delinquent Tax Manager for the Horry County Treasurer's Office, testified to\r\n  the procedure her office generally uses to collect delinquent taxes.Â  Montgomery\r\n  stated the information kept in the Delinquent Tax Office's computer is input by\r\n  the Assessor's Office.Â  She testified, while her office has access to the\r\n  Phoenix database, which is the same database used by the DMV, access to the DMV's\r\n  database is limited.Â  Further, any change in ownership is placed into the\r\n  Delinquent Tax Office's database through the Assessor's Office. \r\nIn regard to this particular\r\n  mobile home, the Delinquent Tax Office sent the first notice through regular\r\n  mail, addressed to Ronald Godbey.Â  The letter was sent to Ronald Godbey as the\r\n  owner instead of Groce because the home was not registered with Horry County in\r\n  Groce's name.Â  The taxes remained unpaid and the Delinquent Tax Office then\r\n  sent a certified letter addressed to Ronald Godbey at an address in Cameron, North\r\n  Carolina. The signature card was returned, dated May 6, 2004, with the\r\n  signature ofÂ  &quot;Candie Godbey.&quot; Â At some point, notice of the 2003\r\n  unpaid taxes on the mobile home was also sent to SouthTrust as the listed\r\n  lienholder of a security interest in the mobile home.Â Â  \r\nWhen the taxes continued to\r\n  be unpaid, the Delinquent Tax Office posted a levy on the property on October\r\n  8, 2004.Â  Montgomery testified Jonathan Hyman posted this particular levy on\r\n  the property, which is printed in duplicate.Â  The levy notice indicated the\r\n  taxes were due from 2003 and the property to be sold was that of Ronald\r\n  Godbey.Â  The notice included the number 998-00-56-002, which identifies the\r\n  actual mobile home, and the number 181 05 11 045, which indicates the parcel of\r\n  land where the mobile home sits.Â  Handwritten on the notice, directly above the\r\n  045 portion of the parcel number is &quot;048*.&quot;Â  Below three lines of\r\n  printed information at the bottom of the levy notice is &quot;Wrong Map # Not\r\n  at (045),&quot; with a hand drawn arrow from this notation to the parcel\r\n  number.Â  Below that was an additional handwritten notation of &quot;No Sticker.&quot;Â \r\n  Montgomery testified the handwritten 048 could have meant Hyman went to parcel\r\n  045, discovered the mobile home he was looking for was not in that place, went\r\n  back to the office where he researched and discovered the mobile home was on\r\n  parcel 048, and then went back to 048 and found the mobile home there.Â  This\r\n  did not raise any concerns for Montgomery, as this was a common occurrence with\r\n  mobile homes since mobile homes are often moved and map numbers are sometimes\r\n  changed.Â  Montgomery also stated the &quot;No Sticker&quot; notation on the\r\n  levy notice did not raise a concern either as she believed that when Hyman went\r\n  to parcel 045, there was a home located on that parcel that did not have a\r\n  sticker.Â  She noted the fact that Hyman brought the carbon copy of the levy\r\n  notice back to the office, and not the whole levy sign, meant that he found the\r\n  mobile home in question. \r\nAfter posting the levy, the\r\n  Delinquent Tax Office advertised the sale of the property in the local\r\n  newspaper on November 18, November 24, and December 2, 2004.Â  The\r\n  advertisements included the mobile home number and parcel number included on\r\n  the levy notice, and listed it as the property of Ronald Godbey.Â  When the\r\n  taxes remained unpaid, the property went to tax sale on December 6, 2004, and\r\n  was purchased by Hollingsworth Rentals.Â  A bill of sale for the mobile home was\r\n  subsequently issued to Hollingsworth Rentals on December 27, 2005.\r\nMontgomery testified, because\r\n  her office was unaware Groce was the owner of the property prior to sale, no\r\n  notice was sent to him prior to the tax sale.Â  During the one-year-redemption\r\n  period, the Delinquent Tax Office would research phone books and records on\r\n  their computers to see if there was any updated information.Â  A screen print\r\n  from the DMV office pulled from the Phoenix system, which was used by the\r\n  Delinquent Tax Office to research mobile homes, was submitted into evidence.Â \r\n  This printed document listed Groce as the owner of the mobile home in question,\r\n  and included the physical address of the mobile home in Myrtle Beach and a\r\n  handwritten notation of &quot;New Owner?&quot; at the bottom. It did not\r\n  provide Groce's North Carolina address, but only the physical address of the\r\n  mobile home in Myrtle Beach.Â  The document was dated May 11, 2005, five months\r\n  after the tax sale of the mobile home.Â  Once the Delinquent Tax Office realized\r\n  there was potentially a new owner of the mobile home, they sent a letter dated\r\n  May 16, 2005 to Groce at the Myrtle Beach address, notifying him of the one-year-\r\n  redemption period.Â  However, the letter was returned, marked &quot;ATTEMPTED\r\n  NOT KNOWN&quot; by the postal service.Â  Montgomery testified when they have\r\n  letters returned like that for a local address, her office would check to see\r\n  if there was a phone number in the phone book or a vehicle registered to the\r\n  individual.Â  A handwritten note in their file, made at some point during the\r\n  redemption period, stated, &quot;No vehicle address for Groce,&quot; indicating\r\n  her office searched records to determine whether Groce had a vehicle registered\r\n  in the county.\r\nMontgomery acknowledged no\r\n  notice of the delinquent taxes was sent to Groce prior to the tax sale, Groce\r\n  was never named on the notice of levy or in the newspaper advertisements, and\r\n  Groce never received notice of the tax sale.Â  However, she testified this lack\r\n  of notice and failure to include his name was due to the fact that Groce never\r\n  registered the mobile home with Horry County, and her office therefore had no\r\n  record that he was the owner.Â  To register the mobile home with the county, all\r\n  Groce needed to do was bring his title to the Assessor's Office, give them the\r\n  information of his mailing address and where the home was located, and pay a\r\n  $5.00 sticker fee for a sticker to be placed in the window of the mobile home.Â \r\n  She further explained that Ronald Godbey was sent the notices and was listed as\r\n  the owner in the documents they prepared relative to this matter because the\r\n  mobile home was registered in Godbey's name and not Groce's.Â  In regard to this\r\n  particular mobile home, Montgomery testified her office took the following\r\n  steps: (1) mailed the delinquent tax notice to Godbey, since he was the\r\n  registered owner, (2) mailed a certified letter to Godbey as the registered\r\n  owner, (3) levied on the property that was actually sold, (4) ran an\r\n  advertisement of the sale in a local newspaper for three days in consecutive\r\n  weeks prior to the tax sale, (5) sent notice of the delinquent taxes to\r\n  SouthTrust as the lienholder of record, (6) conducted the tax sale on December\r\n  6, 2004, and (7) researched for updated information and sent courtesy letters\r\n  during the one-year-redemption period. \r\nFollowing Montgomery's\r\n  testimony, Groce rested his case and the County then moved for a directed\r\n  verdict as to the negligence claim arguing, pursuant to section 15-78-60(11) of\r\n  the South Carolina Code, as a government entity, it was not liable for a loss\r\n  resulting from assessment or collection of taxes or from enforcing the tax\r\n  laws.Â  The trial court agreed, found the County was not liable for damages\r\n  pursuant to that statute, and granted a directed verdict on that claim.Â  The\r\n  trial court further noted the DMV, as well as Wiley and Hollingsworth, were no\r\n  longer subject to Groce's negligence action, pursuant to a consent order.\r\nThe County then moved for a\r\n  directed verdict on the claim to set aside the tax sale.Â  The County argued it\r\n  had complied with the requirements of section 12-51-40 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code, and though Groce asserted that his application with the DMV showing his\r\n  mailing address put the County on notice of that address such that the sale was\r\n  defective, Groce failed to present any evidence that the County had an\r\n  obligation to procure from the DMV the application filed by Groce.Â  The County\r\n  further maintained the owner of record of the property was Ronald Godbey, based\r\n  upon the records with the County, and that was so because Groce failed to\r\n  comply with section 31-17-320 of the South Carolina Code, which required him to\r\n  register as the owner of the mobile home with the County.Â  Groce acknowledged\r\n  his failure to comply with section 31-17-320, but argued that failure did not\r\n  excuse the County from strict compliance with section 12-51-40.Â  Groce asserted\r\n  the County was put on notice that the owner of the property changed and they\r\n  had access to information showing that Groce was the true owner of the property\r\n  by virtue of his registration through the DMV.Â  Groce also questioned the\r\n  validity of the sale because the property was not sold in the name of the true\r\n  owner.Â  The trial court agreed that even if Groce did not register the mobile\r\n  home with the County, the County could not claim it was a valid tax sale if it\r\n  did not comply with the statutory requirements of sending out notice and\r\n  levying.Â  It found, however, that the County followed the requirements of\r\n  section 12-51-40, and although Groce did not receive any type of notice prior\r\n  to the sale, Groce failed to comply with section 31-17-320 and the County was\r\n  not required to do anything further.Â  Thereafter, on October 21, 2008, the\r\n  trial court filed a written order directing a verdict against Groce finding\r\n  Groce failed, as a matter of law, to present evidence establishing he was\r\n  entitled to prevail on any of his claims. The court determined Groce's claim of\r\n  negligence against the County was barred by section 15-78-60(11).Â Â  As to the\r\n  claim to set aside the tax sale, the trial court held the evidence presented\r\n  established the County followed the provisions of section 12-51-40 in\r\n  conducting the tax sale, and though Groce testified he did not receive notice\r\n  of the tax sale, the evidence established the owner of record was provided\r\n  notice at the best address available as required by statute.Â  The trial court\r\n  further held Groce did not receive notice because he failed to license his\r\n  mobile home in the county as required by section 31-17-320(A).Â  This appeal\r\n  follows.\r\nISSUES\r\n1. Whether the trial court erred in\r\n  granting the County's motion for directed verdict in reliance on sections 12-51-40\r\n  and 31-17-320(A) of the South Carolina Code when Groce properly complied with\r\n  DMV mobile home application requirements for obtaining a certificate of title.\r\n2. Whether the trial court erred in\r\n  granting a directed verdict on the issue of damages in reliance on section\r\n  15-78-60(11) of the South Carolina Code when there was evidence in the record\r\n  the County failed to comply with the requirements of section 12-51-40(c) of the\r\n  South Carolina Code.\r\n3. Whether the trial court erred in\r\n  directing a verdict for the County when the interest sold at the tax sale was\r\n  the interest of the prior owner.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen ruling on a motion for\r\n  directed verdict, the trial court is required to view the evidence and the\r\n  inferences that can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the\r\n  nonmoving party.Â Â  Hinkle v. Nat'l Cas. Ins. Co., 354 S.C. 92, 96, 579\r\n  S.E.2d 616, 618 (2003).Â  When reviewing a trial court's grant or denial of a\r\n  motion for directed verdict, the appellate court will reverse only when there\r\n  is no evidence to support the ruling or when the ruling is governed by an error\r\n  of law.Â  Austin v. Stokes-Craven Holding Corp., 387 S.C. 22, 42, 691\r\n  S.E.2d 135, 145 (2010).Â Â  If the evidence as a whole is susceptible of more\r\n  than one reasonable inference, a jury issue is created and the motion should be\r\n  denied.Â  Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 563, 633 S.E.2d 505, 509\r\n  (2006).Â  Essentially, the appellate court must determine whether a verdict for\r\n  the party opposing the motion would be reasonably possible under the facts as\r\n  liberally construed in his or her favor.Â  Id. at 564, 633 S.E.2d at 509.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSection 12-51-40 provides in\r\n  pertinent part as follows:\r\n\r\n  After\r\n    the county treasurer issues his execution against a defaulting taxpayer in his\r\n    jurisdiction, . . . directed to the officer authorized to collect delinquent\r\n    taxes, assessments, penalties, and costs, . . .Â  the officer to which the\r\n    execution is directed shall:\r\n  (a) On\r\n    April first or as soon after that as practicable, mail a notice of delinquent\r\n    property taxes, penalties, assessments, and costs to the defaulting taxpayer\r\n      and to a grantee of record of the property, whose value generated all or part\r\n    of the tax.Â  The notice must be mailed to the best address available,\r\n    which is either the address shown on the deed conveying the property to him,\r\n    the property address, or other corrected or forwarding address of which the\r\n    officer authorized to collect delinquent taxes, penalties, and costs has actual\r\n    knowledge. . . .\r\n  (b) If\r\n    the taxes remain unpaid after thirty days from the date of mailing of the\r\n    delinquent notice, or as soon thereafter as practicable, take exclusive\r\n    possession of the property necessary to satisfy the payment of the taxes,\r\n    assessments, penalties, and costs.Â  In the case of real property,\r\n    exclusive possession is taken by mailing a notice of delinquent property taxes,\r\n    assessments, penalties, and costs to the defaulting taxpayer and any grantee\r\n      of record of the property at the address shown on the tax receipt or to an\r\n    address of which the officer has actual knowledge, by &quot;certified mail,\r\n      return receipt requested-restricted delivery&quot;. . . . In the case of personal\r\n        property, exclusive possession is taken by mailing the notice of delinquent\r\n    property taxes, assessments, penalties, and costs to the person at the\r\n      address shown on the tax receipt or to an address of which the officer has\r\n      actual knowledge.

Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(11)\r\n  (2005).\r\nI.  Compliance with section\r\n  12-51-40 and effect of section 31-17-320(A)\r\nGroce contends the trial\r\n  court erred in granting the County's directed verdict motion on his action to\r\n  set aside the tax sale and deed.Â  He asserts the County failed to use the &quot;best\r\n  evidence&quot;[5] available to notify him, as the grantee of record, of the lien and impending\r\n  sale because his North Carolina mailing address was on file with the DMV and\r\n  was accessible by the County through the DMV.Â  Additionally, Groce argues there\r\n  is a factual dispute as to whether the County complied with section 12-51-40 in\r\n  meeting the levy requirements under the statute. Â He notes there was a\r\n  discrepancy as to the location of the mobile home by the &quot;048*&quot;\r\n  indication on the notice of levy, thereby raising an inference the levy was posted\r\n  on the wrong mobile home, and also maintains there is a factual dispute as to\r\n  whether the property was properly levied, as Montgomery acknowledged she did\r\n  not post on the property herself and therefore could not say the levy was\r\n  posted on it.Â Â  Â Â Finally, Groce maintains the trial court's reliance on section\r\n  31-17-320 is misplaced because, though this statute regulates certain aspects\r\n  of mobile home ownership, it is not a part of the alternate procedure for\r\n  collection of delinquent taxes.Â  Groce contends this section shows that records\r\n  at the DMV &quot;are married to the idea of ownership of mobile homes,&quot;\r\n  thus providing the &quot;best evidence&quot; regarding notice to the owner, and\r\n  the County's failure to take reasonable steps available to it to provide the\r\n  property owner with notice did not satisfy due process requirements.\r\nOur appellate courts have\r\n  consistently held that delinquent tax sales must be conducted in strict\r\n  compliance with statutory requirements.Â  Hawkins v. Bruno Yacht Sales, Inc.,\r\n  353 S.C. 31, 36, 577 S.E.2d 202, 205 (2003);Â  Rives v. Bulsa, 325 S.C.\r\n  287, 292, 478 S.E.2d 878, 880 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Failure to give notice of a tax\r\n  sale pursuant to these requirements is a fundamental defect in the tax\r\n  proceedings that renders the proceedings absolutely void.Â  Hawkins, 353\r\n  S.C. at 36, 577 S.E.2d at 205.Â  Thus, regardless of whether Groce properly\r\n  registered the mobile home with the County, if the County failed to strictly\r\n  comply with the statutory requirements of the sale, the tax sale would be void.\r\nA.&nbsp; Mailing of noticesÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSection 12-51-40(a) directs\r\n  the officer authorized to collect delinquent taxes to mail a notice of\r\n  delinquent property taxes, penalties, assessments, and costs &quot;to the\r\n  defaulting taxpayer and to a grantee of record,&quot; and provides the notice\r\n  is to be mailed to &quot;the best address available, which is either the\r\n  address shown on the deed conveying the property to him, the property address,\r\n  or other corrected or forwarding address of which the officer authorized to\r\n  collect delinquent taxes, penalties, and costs has actual knowledge.&quot;Â \r\n  Accordingly, the County was required to mail notice of the delinquent taxes to\r\n  Ronald Godbey as the defaulting taxpayer.Â  The undisputed evidence shows Ronald\r\n  Godbey was sent the notices and was listed as the owner in the documents the\r\n  County prepared relative to this matter because the mobile home was registered\r\n  in Godbey's name.Â  The property was not registered in Groce's name due to the\r\n  fact Groce failed to register the mobile home as required by section\r\n  31-17-320.Â  Accordingly, Groce was not a &quot;grantee of record.&quot;Â  \r\nAs to the requirement that\r\n  the notices be sent to &quot;the best address available,&quot; Groce does not\r\n  dispute that the notices were sent to the proper address for Godbey.Â  Rather,\r\n  he contends the County was required to notify him at his North Carolina mailing\r\n  address, which was on file with the DMV and was accessible by the County\r\n  through the DMV.Â  As previously noted, the undisputed evidence is that the\r\n  County did not have an address on file for Groce prior to the tax sale because\r\n  Groce failed to register the mobile home with the County as required by section\r\n  31-17-320.Â  While there is evidence that the County had limited access to the\r\n  DMV's Phoenix system database, the testimony shows this information would be\r\n  limited, it was unknown what access Horry County in particular would have had\r\n  to the system as each county's technology is different, and back in 2005 county\r\n  access would have been even more limited to the DMV's mobile home records, as\r\n  the information available to the counties had evolved over the years.Â  Thus,\r\n  there is no evidence the County had access to Groce's North Carolina mailing\r\n  address through the DMV's Phoenix database.Â  Indeed, the screen print from the\r\n  DMV office pulled from the Phoenix system, which was used by the Delinquent Tax\r\n  Office to research this mobile home and was printed some five months after the\r\n  tax sale, included only the physical address of the mobile home in Myrtle Beach\r\n  and did not provide Groce's North Carolina address.Â  Accordingly, there is no\r\n  evidence the County failed to use the &quot;best address available&quot; to it.\r\nThough Groce essentially\r\n  maintains that the County had a duty to fill out an application to perform a\r\n  title search on the mobile home with the DMV, which is a State agency, we find such\r\n  measures are not necessary for statutory compliance.Â  Ostensibly, the County\r\n  could employ an investigator to track potential owners of mobile homes when\r\n  owners of record are notified and taxes remain unpaid; however, we do not\r\n  believe the legislature intended to create such an undue burden on the counties\r\n  in order to comply with the statute.Â  Clearly, had Groce complied with the\r\n  statutory mandate of section 31-17-320 that he license the mobile home with the\r\n  County within fifteen days of purchase, the County would have known Groce was a\r\n  grantee of record and would have been required to provide notice to him at the\r\n  best address available.Â  Because Groce failed to comply with the requirement of\r\n  county registration, the County was unaware prior to the tax sale that\r\n  ownership had changed in the mobile home, and Godbey was still the owner of\r\n  record in the County's files.Â  Accordingly, the County properly sent the\r\n  required notices under section 12-51-40 to Godbey at the best address available\r\n  for him.[6]Â Â \r\n  We decline to find registration of the mobile home with the state's DMV office\r\n  was sufficient to put the County on notice of Groce's ownership of the mobile\r\n  home and Groce's preferred mailing address.Â  Further, there is no evidence the\r\n  County had actual knowledge of Groce's mailing address.Â  Accordingly, we find\r\n  the only evidence of record shows the County complied with the requirements of\r\n  section 12-51-40(a) in mailing the necessary notices.\r\nB.&nbsp; Levy requirements\r\nGroce contends the trial court\r\n  erred in directing a verdict for the County as there is a factual dispute as to\r\n  whether the County complied with the levy portion of the statute in physically\r\n  posting the property.Â  Subsection (b) of section 12-51-40 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code provides, in the case of personal property, exclusive possession is taken\r\n  by mailing the notice &quot;to the person at the address shown on the tax\r\n  receipt or to an address of which the officer has actual knowledge.&quot;Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-40(b) (Supp. 2010).Â  Here, the County mailed notice by\r\n  certified mail to Ronald Godbey, the defaulting taxpayer and only person shown\r\n  as owner of record with the county, and the return receipt was signed by Candie\r\n  Godbey, indicating receipt of the notice.Â  Unlike real property, personal\r\n  property does not require that this notice be mailed certified with delivery\r\n  restricted to the addressee.Â  See Hawkins, 353 S.C. at 39, 577\r\n  S.E.2d at 206 (holding, though the legislature intended certified mail\r\n  requirements apply to both real and personal property under subsection (b) of section\r\n  12-51-40, the legislature did not intend to require notices on personal\r\n  property be mailed restricted delivery).Â  Accordingly, the County successfully\r\n  levied by distress on the property by sending the notice certified mail to Ronald\r\n  Godbey, receipt of which was acknowledged by Candie Godbey, and it was not\r\n  necessary for the County to thereafter levy by posting on the property inasmuch\r\n  as the &quot;return receipt of the 'certified mail' notice&quot; was &quot;equivalent\r\n  to 'levying by distress'&quot; under section 12-51-40(b).Â  Thus, even if there\r\n  were any questions of fact as to the sufficiency of the County's posting of the\r\n  levy notice on the property itself, that posting was not necessary.[7]\r\nWe find, as a matter of law,\r\n  the County complied with the requirements of section 12-51-40 and satisfied due\r\n  process requirements by complying with the statute and taking additional steps\r\n  in an attempt to locate Groce after the tax sale when the County discovered the\r\n  possibility that Groce had purchased the mobile home in question.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  a verdict for Groce would not be reasonably possible under the facts as\r\n  liberally construed in his favor and the trial court properly granted the\r\n  County's motion for directed verdict.\r\nC.&nbsp; Section 31-17-320\r\nGroce argues the trial court's\r\n  reliance on section 31-17-320 is misplaced because this statute is not a part\r\n  of the alternate procedure for collection of delinquent taxes.Â  He further\r\n  argues that section 31-17-320(B) allows for issuance of a license upon receipt\r\n  of either a copy of the certificate of title or a copy of the completed\r\n  application for a certificate of title, thereby indicating the records at the\r\n  DMV are married to the idea of ownership of mobile homes.Â  These arguments were\r\n  neither raised to nor ruled upon by the trial court and therefore are not\r\n  preserved for review.Â  See Aiken v. World Fin. Corp. of S.C., 373\r\n  S.C. 144, 148, 644 S.E.2d 705, 708 (2007) (stating, in order for an issue to be\r\n  preserved for appellate review, it must have been raised to and ruled upon by\r\n  the trial judge); Murphy v. Jefferson Pilot Commc'ns Co., 364 S.C. 453,\r\n  465, 613 S.E.2d 808, 814 (Ct. App. 2005) (indicating arguments raised for the\r\n  first time on appeal are not preserved for our review).\r\nII. Directed verdict on the negligence\r\n  cause of action\r\nGroce next contends the trial\r\n  court erred in granting a directed verdict on the issue of damages in reliance\r\n  on section 15-78-60(11) of the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.Â  Groce relies on\r\n  the case of Tanner v. Florence County Treasurer, 336 S.C. 552, 521\r\n  S.E.2d 153 (1999), for the proposition that damages may lie where one's\r\n  property has been sold at a tax sale following a county's failure to follow the\r\n  statutorily required procedure set forth in section 12-51-40.Â  Groce contends,\r\n  because there is evidence of negligence in that the County failed to review the\r\n  DMV records to determine the owner of record prior to the tax sale and failed\r\n  to otherwise comply with the requirements of section 12-51-40, the trial court\r\n  erred in relying on section 15-78-60(11) in granting summary judgment to the\r\n  County on the issue of damages.\r\nThis issue is not preserved\r\n  for appellate review.Â  The County moved for a directed verdict on the\r\n  negligence claim arguing it was not liable for loss resulting from the\r\n  assessment or collection of taxes or enforcement of the tax laws pursuant to\r\n  section 15-78-60(11), and the actions complained of by Groce were those taken\r\n  during the collection of delinquent taxes and the enforcement of the tax laws.Â \r\n  In response, counsel for Groce stated it was her understanding the burden was\r\n  on the government to show that it fell into an exception to the waiver of\r\n  immunity under the act.Â  Counsel then asked for &quot;a couple of minutes to\r\n  put [her] hands on [her] notes.&quot;Â  The trial court agreed to give her some\r\n  time.Â  Counsel thereafter apologized, stating, &quot;I had it on a pad and we've\r\n  had so many pads over here.&quot;Â  She then informed the court that she did not\r\n  wish to cause any further delay.Â  Thereupon, the trial court stated there was\r\n  nothing to indicate the mobile home was sold for any other reason than\r\n  delinquent taxes and granted a directed verdict on the issue, finding the\r\n  County could not be held liable for damages pursuant to section 15-78-60(11).Â \r\n  Counsel for Groce did not object to this ruling, nor did counselÂ  argue to the\r\n  court, as Groce does on appeal, that the County could still be liable for\r\n  damages in spite of section 15-78-60(11) if the County failed to comply with\r\n  the statutory requirements of section 12-51-40.Â  Rather, counsel directed the\r\n  court's attention to the fact that the directed verdict regarding damages did\r\n  not settle the issue of the validity of the tax sale under Groce's declaratory\r\n  judgment action to set aside the tax sale.Â  Because Groce did not make any\r\n  argument against the directed verdict on the negligence action, and clearly did\r\n  not make the specific argument to the trial court he now raises on appeal, this\r\n  issue is not preserved. Â See S.C. Dep't of Transp. v. First Carolina\r\n    Corp. of S.C., 372 S.C. 295, 301-02, 641 S.E.2d 903, 907 (2007) (holding,\r\n  to be preserved for appellate review, an issue must have been:Â  (1) raised to\r\n  and ruled upon by the trial court, (2) raised by the appellant, (3) raised in a\r\n  timely manner, and (4) raised to the trial court with sufficient specificity).Â  See also Â I'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406,\r\n  422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000) (stating imposing preservation requirements on\r\n  the appellant is meant to enable the lower court to rule properly after it has\r\n  considered all relevant facts, law, and arguments, and noting that the purpose\r\n  of an appeal is to determine whether the trial court erroneously acted or\r\n  failed to act, and when appellant's contentions are not presented or passed upon\r\n  by the trial court, such contentions will not be considered on appeal).\r\nIII. Interest sold\r\nLastly,\r\n  Groce contends the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict to the\r\n  County based upon the interest sold.Â  He argues the record shows the interest\r\n  sold by the County was not that of the record owner, Groce, but that of the\r\n  previous owner, Godbey, and the County publicly advertised the sale of property\r\n  owned by Godbey and the Bill of Sale from the tax sale shows the interest\r\n  purchased was that of the defaulting taxpayer, Godbey. Â He therefore maintains\r\n  his interests were not sold at the tax sale.Â  In making this argument, Groce\r\n  cites the case of F.C. Enterprises, Inc. v. Dibble, 335 S.C. 260, 516\r\n  S.E.2d 459 (Ct. App. 1999), for the proposition that one purchases at a tax\r\n  sale the property interest of the person referenced in the newspaper\r\n  publication and whose name is listed on the Bill of Sale as the defaulting\r\n  taxpayer, because &quot;as a matter of law, a purchaser at a tax sale acquires\r\n  only that interest held by the owner of the property at the time of the tax\r\n  sale.&quot;Â  Id. at 266, 516 S.E.2d at 462. Â He further cites the case\r\n  of Harrington v. Blackstone, 311 S.C. 459, 429 S.E.2d 826 (Ct. App.\r\n  1993), for the proposition that a purchaser at a judicial sale secures the same\r\n  title and rights in the property as the person whose interest was sold, or of\r\n  the persons bound by the decree of sale.Â  Id. at 465, 429 S.E.2d at 830.Â \r\n  We find no merit to this argument.Â  \r\nBoth Dibble and Harrington are clearly distinguishable, and do not support\r\n  the argument asserted by Groce.Â  In Dibble, this court found that a\r\n  purchaser at a tax sale of property that was subject to a lease and an option,\r\n  entered into before the taxes became delinquent on the property, purchased the\r\n  property subject to the lease and option, acquiring only that interest held by\r\n  the owner of the property at the time of the tax sale.Â  335 S.C. at 266, 516\r\n  S.E.2d at 462. Â In Harrington, the master foreclosed a bank's mortgage\r\n  and ordered the property sold at public sale subject to the provisions of the\r\n  master deed as to the property submitted to the homeowners' property regime.Â \r\n  311 S.C. at 461, 429 S.E.2d at 828.Â  The purchaser at the foreclosure sale,\r\n  Blackston, argued none of the property purchased at the foreclosure sale was\r\n  restricted by the master deed.Â  Id. at 464, 429 S.E.2d at 829.Â  This\r\n  court held, by purchasing the property, Blackston became a party to the\r\n  proceedings and was bound by the order of foreclosure.Â Â  Id. at 465, 429\r\n  S.E.2d at 830.Â  In so holding, the court noted, &quot;a purchaser at a judicial\r\n  sale secures the same title and rights in the property as the person whose\r\n  interest was sold, or of the persons bound by the decree of sale.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nHere, the lien attached to\r\n  the property on December 31, 2002, and the taxes became delinquent when they\r\n  remained unpaid after January 15, 2004.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 12-49-10 &amp; -20\r\n  (2000); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-45-70(A) (Supp. 2010); Dibble, 335 S.C. at\r\n  263-64, 516 S.E.2d at 461.Â  Thus, the delinquent taxpayer was Godbey.Â  Section\r\n  12-51-40(d) specifically provides the advertisement of the property must\r\n  include &quot;the delinquent taxpayer's name,&quot; but does not require\r\n  inclusion of a subsequent purchaser who fails to register his property with the\r\n  county. Â Further, section 12-51-130 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010) provides,\r\n  when the property is not redeemed within the time period allowed, a tax title\r\n  is to be issued which must include the name of the defaulting taxpayer and the\r\n  name of any grantee of record of the property.Â  Accordingly, the advertisement\r\n  and the Bill of Sale both properly included Godbey as the defaulting taxpayer.Â \r\n  As previously noted, Groce was not a grantee of record, and therefore it was\r\n  not necessary to list him as a grantee of record in the Bill of Sale.Â  Further,\r\n  because Groce's purchase of the property was subsequent to the taxes becoming\r\n  delinquent, Groce's interest in the property was subject to the tax lien.Â  In\r\n  short, we do not believe Dibble and Harrington, which provide the\r\n  purchaser at a judicial or tax sale takes the property subject to pre-existing\r\n  encumbrances and liens on the property, have any bearing on whether an unknown\r\n  purchaser of property, who purchased the property subsequent to taxes becoming\r\n  delinquent on the property, must be named in the advertisements and Bill of\r\n  Sale in order for the tax sale to be valid.Â  Indeed, to accept such an\r\n  interpretation would allow one to avoid paying delinquent taxes on property\r\n  subject to a tax lien by purchasing the property but concealing his ownership\r\n  of the property and thereafter challenging any delinquent tax sale on the basis\r\n  that he was not named in the tax sale.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe are not unsympathetic to\r\n  Groce, as it does not appear he deliberately concealed his ownership in the\r\n  property but, rather, applied for title with the DMV and, being from North\r\n  Carolina, was simply unaware of the registration requirement with the County.Â \r\n  However, Groce's ignorance of the law is of no avail to him.Â  &quot;Ignorantia\r\n    juris quod quisque tenetur scire, neminem excusat&quot;Â  denotes &quot;Ignorance\r\n  of the [or a] law, which everyone is bound to know, excuses no man.&quot;Â  Black's\r\n  Law Dictionary 747 (6th ed. 1990).Â  Accordingly, we (1) affirm the trial court's\r\n  directed verdict on the action to set aside the tax sale and deed on the basis\r\n  of sections 12-51-40 and 31-17-320(A), finding the County complied with the\r\n  statutory requirements of section 12-51-40 and Groce was not a grantee of\r\n  record because he failed to register his mobile home as required by section\r\n  31-17-320(A); (2) affirm the trial court's directed verdict as to Groce's\r\n  negligence cause of action finding the issue unpreserved as Groce failed to\r\n  argue against the motion at the trial level, and specifically failed to argue\r\n  to the trial court that which he argues on appeal; and (3) find no merit to\r\n  Groce's assertion that the tax sale was invalid because it was advertised in\r\n  Godbey's name and the Bill of Sale was issued in Godbey's name.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, KONDUROS, and LOCKEMY,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Although Groce testified the mobile home was\r\n  purchased by him at a bankruptcy sale, there is evidence SouthTrust actually\r\n  sold it to Groce following the bank's repossession of the mobile home.\r\n[3] Groce also testified that after going to the DMV, he\r\n  stopped by &quot;this tax place&quot; where he met a woman named &quot;Annemarie&quot;\r\n  and inquired about outstanding taxes on the property, but Annemarie &quot;had\r\n  no record of it.&quot;Â  However, Groce could not remember if he provided the\r\n  physical address of the mobile home in South Carolina, and could not remember\r\n  what information he provided to Annemarie in order to determine whether any\r\n  taxes were owed.Â  Before Groce left, Annemarie gave him a piece of paper with\r\n  her name and a phone number.Â  The paper was a handwritten note with &quot;Assessors\r\n  office&quot;

rather than &quot;best evidence,&quot; as the statute\r\n  in question requires notice be mailed to the &quot;best address available.&quot;\r\n[6] Though the County was on notice that Groce was a\r\n  potential new owner of the mobile home pursuant to the screen print from the\r\n  DMV database, this screen print did not occur until five months after the\r\n  property was sold at the tax sale, well after the County had already complied\r\n  with the requirements of section 12-51-40.Â  Further, the evidence shows the\r\n  County did make an effort during the redemption period to send notice to Groce\r\n  that the tax sale had occurred by sending a letter to Groce at the address\r\n  noted on the printout, and subsequently followed up by searching for another\r\n  address for him when that letter was returned to the County.Â  \r\n[7] See Rule 220(c), SCACR (&quot;The appellate\r\n  court may affirm any ruling, order, decision or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing\r\n  in the Record on Appeal.&quot;).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-126","title":"Clark v.

Myers, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Beulah\r\n  R. Butler appeals her convictions of voluntary manslaughter and possession of a\r\n  firearm or a knife during the commission of a violent crime.Â  On appeal, Butler\r\n  contends the trial court erred in denying her motion for a directed verdict,\r\n  arguing the trial court erred in the following: (1) &quot;[failing to] apply\r\n  the standard that the [S]tate had to disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable\r\n  doubt at the directed verdict stage&quot; and (2) &quot;only [applying] the\r\n  traditional 'any evidence' standard of voluntary manslaughter without regard to\r\n  self-defense.&quot;Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;There\r\n  are four elements required by law to establish self-defense.&quot;Â  State v.\r\n    Davis, 282 S.C. 45, 46, 317 S.E.2d 452, 453 (1984).Â  The elements include:\r\n\r\n  First,\r\n    the defendant must be without fault in bringing on the difficulty. Second, the\r\n    defendant must have actually believed he was in imminent danger of losing his\r\n    life or sustaining serious bodily injury, or he actually was in such imminent\r\n    danger. Â Third, if his defense is based upon his belief of imminent danger, a\r\n    reasonably prudent man of ordinary firmness and courage would have entertained\r\n    the same belief. If the defendant actually was in imminent danger, the\r\n    circumstances were such as would warrant a man of ordinary prudence, firmness\r\n    and courage to strike the fatal blow in order to save himself from serious\r\n    bodily harm or losing his own life. Fourth, the defendant had no other probable\r\n    means of avoiding the danger of losing his own life or sustaining serious\r\n    bodily injury than to act as he did in this particular instance. If, however,\r\n    the defendant was on his own premises he had no duty to retreat before acting\r\n    in self-defense. \r\n\r\nId.\r\nThe\r\n  State produced sufficient evidence showing Butler did not act in self-defense.Â \r\n  Specifically, the State produced evidence negating the second element of\r\n  self-defense that &quot;the defendant must have actually believed he was in\r\n  imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury, or he\r\n  actually was in such imminent danger.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The evidence presented\r\n  included Butler's own statements that she was not acting to defend herself from\r\n  &quot;imminent danger,&quot; but rather that the incident was merely an\r\n  accident.Â  Butler made statements that the Victim &quot;rolled over on the\r\n  knife,&quot; &quot;fell on the knife,&quot; and &quot;jumped over the couch and\r\n  landed on the knife.&quot;Â  Additionally, Butler admitted on cross-examination\r\n  she did not act in self-defense, but rather the stabbing was an accident.Â  Thus,\r\n  viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the evidence\r\n  supported submitting the case to the jury. \r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nFEW, C.J., THOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-128","title":"Haney v.

Haney, Jr., was\r\n  entitled to temporary total disability benefits.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\n1. We hold the circuit\r\n  court correctly applied the &quot;last injurious exposure&quot; rule in\r\n  determining that Ray's and the Fund were liable for compensating Haney's\r\n  disability because substantial evidence supports the Appellate Panel's finding\r\n  Haney's final exposure to the cause of his carpel tunnel syndrome occurred on\r\n  August 31, 2004, when Ray's lacked workers' compensation insurance coverage.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5) (Supp. 2010) (limiting a\r\n  reviewing court to correcting errors of law or factual findings that are\r\n  &quot;clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial\r\n  evidence on the whole record&quot;).Â  Haney's August 31, 2004 injury was not a\r\n  recurrence of an earlier injury; instead, it was an independent traumatic event\r\n  that contributed to the causation of his disability.Â  See Geathers v.\r\n    3V, Inc., 371 S.C. 570, 577-79, 641 S.E.2d 29, 33-34 (2007) (citation\r\n  omitted) (adopting the &quot;last injurious exposure&quot; rule, which &quot;'places full liability upon the carrier covering the\r\n  risk at the time of the most recent injury that bears a causal relation to the\r\n  disability'&quot;); Bass\r\n    v. Isochem, 365 S.C. 454, 474-75, 617 S.E.2d 369, 380 (Ct. App. 2005)\r\n  (explaining carpel tunnel syndrome is a repetitive trauma injury, having\r\n  &quot;a gradual onset caused by the cumulative effect of repetitive traumatic events\r\n  or 'mini accidents'&quot;).\r\n2. We hold the circuit\r\n  court properly upheld the Appellate Panel's finding of temporary total\r\n  disability because substantial evidence indicates Haney was terminated and unable\r\n  to find subsequent work because of his carpel tunnel syndrome.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann.

Code Ann. Â§ 30-7-10 (2007) (&quot;[A]ll\r\nmortgages . . . are valid so as to affect the rights of subsequent creditors (whether lien creditors or simple contract creditors), or purchasers for valuable\r\nconsideration without notice, only from the day and hour when they are recorded in the office of the register of deeds . . . .&quot;); Nat'l Bank of Newberry\r\nv. Livingston, 155 S.C. 264, 282, 152 S.E. 410, 417 (1930) (finding there was no question that a duly recorded mortgage gave constructive notice of its\r\nexistence to creditors).\r\n2.&nbsp; As to the order granting summary judgment against Appellant Eric Lapin, we reverse and remand.&nbsp; See Rule 56(c), SCRCP (providing for\r\nsummary judgment where there is no genuine issue of material fact); Oblachinski v. Reynolds, Op. No. 26932 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Feb. 22, 2011) (Shearouse\r\nAdv. Sh. No. 6 at 49) (&quot;In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be\r\ndrawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.&quot;) (internal quotation omitted); Wachovia Bank, N.A. v.

Lott, 387 S.C. 339, 346, 692 S.E.2d 900, 903 (2010) (&quot;Under the two issue rule, where a decision is based on\r\nmore than one ground, the appellate court will affirm unless the appellant appeals all grounds because the unappealed ground will become the law of the\r\ncase.&quot;).&nbsp;\r\n4.&nbsp; As to the order denying the motion to compel, we find this issue is not preserved for appellate review because the trial court ruled only on the\r\nmotion to compel filed and argued by codefendants who are not parties to the present appeal.&nbsp; See S.C.

Valenta, Jr, Philip S. Porter, and Linda A. Grice, of Blythewood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This appeal arises out of a decision by the Administrative Law Court (ALC) to reverse an order by the South Carolina Office of Motor\r\nVehicle Hearings which rescinded the driver's license suspension of Phillip Samuel Brown due to driving under the influence.&nbsp; On appeal, Brown argues the\r\nALC erred in reinstating his license suspension because the arresting officer failed to establish that the breath test administered and the sample obtained were\r\nconducted pursuant to section 56-5-2950 of the South Carolina Code (2006). We affirm[1] pursuant to Rule 220(b),\r\nSCACR, and the following authority: Hill v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl.

Sammataro, both of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; Robin Carson Cantrell appeals the circuit court's order affirming the Appellate Panel of the Workers' Compensation Commission's (the\r\nAppellate Panel) decision his injury was not compensable under the Workers' Compensation Act (the Act).&nbsp; Cantrell argues the circuit court erred in (1)\r\nholding the Appellate Panel properly considered evidence probative of a non-work related injury, (2) holding substantial evidence supported the findings of the\r\nAppellate Panel, and (3) failing to rule on various issues necessary to determine an award in the event his injury is deemed compensable on review.&nbsp; We\r\naffirm.[1]\r\n1.&nbsp; We hold the circuit court did not err in holding the Appellate Panel properly considered evidence indicating Cantrell injured his shoulder during a\r\ntrip to Carowinds, specifically the testimony of his employer's human resources administrator and statements made in a form submitted to his employer in order\r\nto receive short-term disability benefits. &nbsp;An appellate court may reverse a decision of the Appellate Panel if a claimant's substantial rights &quot;have\r\nbeen prejudiced because the [Appellate Panel's] findings, inferences, [or] conclusions&quot; are &quot;affected by other error of law,&quot; or &quot;arbitrary\r\nor capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.&quot;&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5) (Supp.\r\n2010).&nbsp; &quot;Great liberality is to be exercised in allowing the introduction of evidence in workers' compensation proceedings.&quot;&nbsp; Trotter v.\r\nTrane Coil Facility, 384 S.C. 109, 116, 681 S.E.2d 36, 40 (Ct. App. 2009).\r\nFirst, although the Rules of Evidence are not mandatory in workers' compensation proceedings, they serve as a guide in determining the authenticity of\r\ndocuments relied on by the Appellate Panel.&nbsp; See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-330(1) (2005).&nbsp; The question of authenticity rests with the discretion\r\nof the single commissioner and Appellate Panel. &nbsp;Cf. Rule 901(b)(3), SCRE (suggesting &quot;[c]omparison by the trier of fact or by expert witnesses\r\nwith specimens which have been authenticated&quot;); Rule 901(b)(4), SCRE (suggesting attention to &quot;[a]ppearance, contents, substance, internal patterns,\r\nor other distinctive characteristics, taken in conjunction with circumstances&quot;). &nbsp;Accordingly, the Appellate Panel did not err in relying on the form.\r\nSecond, hearsay evidence is admissible in workers' compensation proceedings &quot;if corroborated by facts, circumstances, or other evidence.&quot;&nbsp; Hamilton\r\nv. Bob Bennett Ford, 339 S.C. 68, 70, 528 S.E.2d 667, 668 (2000).&nbsp; The testimony of Cantrell's human resources administrator was corroborated by other\r\nevidence before the Appellate Panel, including the form and a statement made by Cantrell to his physician.&nbsp; Accordingly, the Appellate Panel did not err in\r\nrelying on the testimony.\r\n2.&nbsp; We hold the circuit court properly held substantial evidence, including a statement Cantrell made to his physician indicating his injury occurred\r\nafter a trip to Carowinds, supported the Appellate Panel's findings of fact.&nbsp; See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5)(e) (Supp. 2010) (requiring an\r\nappellate court to decide whether the findings of fact are &quot;clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole\r\nrecord&quot;).\r\n3.&nbsp; Because substantial evidence supports the Appellate Panel's decision Cantrell's injury is not compensable, we need not address the remaining issues.\r\n&nbsp;See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling an appellate court need not review\r\nremaining issues when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J., and THOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-133","title":"State v.
