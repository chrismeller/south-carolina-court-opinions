Greene, Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Abbeville County\r\nEugene C. Griffith, Jr., Circuit Court\r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2012-UP-001\r\nSubmitted December 1, 2011 – Filed January\r\n  4, 2012 \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAppellate Defender M. Celia Robinson, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Alan Wilson, Chief Deputy Attorney General John\r\n  W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Senior\r\n  Deputy Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; and Solicitor\r\n  Jerry W. Peace, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  Antjuan\r\n  T. Greene appeals his convictions for first-degree burglary, criminal domestic\r\n  violence of a high and aggravated nature (CDVHAN), and malicious injury to real\r\n  property.  Greene argues the trial court erred (1) in denying his directed\r\n  verdict motions on his CDVHAN and first-degree burglary charges and (2) in admitting\r\n  unduly prejudicial photographs into evidence.  We affirm.[1]\r\n1.  We find the record contains sufficient evidence upon which the\r\n  trial court could have relied in denying both of Greene's directed verdict\r\n  motions.  &quot;When ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court\r\n  is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its\r\n  weight.&quot;  State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648\r\n  (2006).  &quot;If there is any direct evidence or any substantial\r\n  circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused,\r\n  the [appellate] [c]ourt must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.&quot;  Id. at 292-93, 625 S.E.2d at 648.  \r\nIf a person commits a criminal domestic violence offense and the\r\n  elements of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN) are\r\n  present, that person is guilty of CDVHAN.  State v. Sullivan, 362 S.C.\r\n  373, 375, 608 S.E.2d, 422, 424 (2005).  &quot;ABHAN is 'an unlawful act of\r\n  violent injury' accompanied by a circumstance of aggravation.&quot;  Id. at 375-76, 608 S.E.2d at 424 (quoting State v. Primus, 349 S.C. 576,\r\n  580, 564 S.E.2d 103, 105 (2002)).  Among the potential circumstances of\r\n  aggravation is serious bodily injury.  Id. at 376, 608 S.E.2d at 424.  As\r\n  to the CDVHAN charge, the State presented testimony and photographs showing the\r\n  victim suffered three separate nose fractures, a cut requiring four stitches, swelling\r\n  of the eyes to the point the victim could no longer see, and multiple other\r\n  scrapes and bruises as a result of Greene's attack.  Based on this testimony\r\n  and photographs submitted at trial, the State presented evidence that\r\n  reasonably tended to prove the victim suffered serious bodily injury. \r\n  Accordingly, the record contains sufficient evidence the trial court could rely\r\n  on in denying Greene's motion for a directed verdict.  \r\nAs to the burglary charge, we initially note Greene's argument\r\n  concerning the victim consenting to Greene's entry into the home was never raised\r\n  to or ruled upon by the trial court; therefore, it is not preserved for review.\r\n   See State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 694\r\n  (2003) (&quot;A party may not argue one ground at trial and an alternate ground\r\n  on appeal.&quot;).  Concerning the portion of Greene's argument that is\r\n  preserved, &quot;[a] person is guilty of burglary in the first degree if the\r\n  person enters a dwelling without consent and with intent to commit a crime in\r\n  the dwelling, and . . . while in the dwelling or in immediate flight, he . . .\r\n  causes physical injury to a person who is not a participant in the crime.&quot; \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. § 16-11-311(A)(1)(b) (2003).  Because intent is generally not\r\n  susceptible to proof by direct evidence, it ordinarily must be inferred from\r\n  circumstantial evidence.  State v. Tuckness, 257 S.C. 295, 299, 185\r\n  S.E.2d 607, 608 (1971).  Here, the State presented testimony stating Greene\r\n  repeatedly beat and kicked the victim's door and pushed aside a clothes dryer\r\n  just to gain entry to the home.  Moreover, the victim testified, upon entering\r\n  her home, Greene immediately came towards her and began his assault.  Based on\r\n  this testimony, the State presented evidence reasonably tending to prove Greene\r\n  intended to commit a crime upon entering the victim's home.  Accordingly, the\r\n  trial court did not err in denying Greene's directed verdict motion on the\r\n  first-degree burglary charge.  \r\n2.  We find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\r\n  admitting into evidence photographs showing the victim's injuries.  &quot;The\r\n  relevance, materiality and admissibility of photographs are matters within the\r\n  sound discretion of the trial court and a ruling will be disturbed only upon a\r\n  showing of an abuse of discretion.&quot;  State v. Rosemond, 335 S.C.\r\n  593, 596, 518 S.E.2d 588, 589-90 (1999).  Relevant evidence &quot;may be\r\n  excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of\r\n  unfair prejudice.&quot;  Rule 403, SCRE.  Photographs entered into evidence\r\n  will be considered unfairly prejudicial when they create an undue tendency to\r\n  suggest an improper basis for a decision, usually based on emotion.  State\r\n    v. Jackson, 364 S.C. 329, 334, 613 S.E.2d 374, 376 (2005).  Such photographs\r\n  which are &quot;calculated to arouse the sympathy or prejudice of the jury\r\n  should be excluded if they are irrelevant or not necessary to substantiate\r\n  material facts or conditions.&quot;  Id.  &quot;If [a] photograph serves\r\n  to corroborate testimony, it is not an abuse of discretion to admit it.&quot;  Rosemond,\r\n  355 S.C. at 597, 518 S.E.2d at 590.  One of the aggravating circumstances that\r\n  can lead to a conviction for CDVHAN is serious bodily injury.  See Sullivan,\r\n  362 S.C. at 375-76, 608 S.E.2d at 424.  Although the photographs in question\r\n  depict blood due to the victim's injuries following her assault, the nature of\r\n  these injuries is very probative as to whether the serious bodily injury\r\n  circumstance has been fulfilled such that Greene could be convicted of CDVHAN. \r\n  Additionally, the photographs serve to corroborate the testimony of several\r\n  witnesses as to the nature and severity of the victim's injuries.  Accordingly,\r\n  the trial court did not err in admitting photographs of the victim's injuries.  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-002","title":"Shock v.

Florian, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Reginald\r\n  Shock appeals the Administrative Law Court's (ALC) order dismissing his inmate\r\n  grievance appeal.  Shock argues the ALC erred in determining his right to due\r\n  process was not violated during his disciplinary hearing for possession of a\r\n  cell phone.  We affirm.[1]  \r\nInitially, we find Shock's due process arguments concerning his\r\n  requested witnesses being present at trial, his requested counsel substitute,\r\n  and the insufficient return by the Disciplinary Hearing Officer (DHO) not\r\n  preserved for review.  See Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 379,\r\n  527 S.E.2d 742, 755 (2000) (stating issues that have not been raised to and\r\n  ruled upon by the ALC are not preserved for review); see also State\r\n    v. Owens, 378 S.C. 636, 638-39, 664 S.E.2d 80, 81 (2008) (finding due\r\n  process rights issue not properly raised and ruled upon unpreserved for review); Ward v. State, 343 S.C. 14, 18, 538 S.E.2d 245, 247 (2000) (stating an\r\n  ALC can rule on whether a party's constitutional rights have been violated). \r\n\r\n[D]ue process in a prison disciplinary proceeding involving\r\n  serious misconduct requires:  (1) that advance written notice of the charge be\r\n  given to the inmate at least twenty-four hours before the hearing; (2) that\r\n  factfinders must prepare a written statement of the evidence relied on and\r\n  reasons for the disciplinary action; (3) that the inmate should be allowed to\r\n  call witnesses and present documentary evidence, provided there is no undue\r\n  hazard to institutional safety or correctional goals; (4) that counsel\r\n  substitute (a fellow inmate or a prison employee) should be allowed to help\r\n  illiterate inmates or in complex cases an inmate cannot handle alone; and (5)\r\n  that the persons hearing the matter, who may be prison officials or employees,\r\n  must be impartial.  \r\n\r\nAl-Shabazz, 338 S.C. at 371, 527 S.E.2d at 751 (citing Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 563-72 (1974)).  &quot;Agency\r\n  officials or members who adjudicate a matter are presumed to be honest, fair,\r\n  and unbiased.&quot;  Garris v. Governing Bd. of S.C. Reinsurance Facility,\r\n  333 S.C. 432, 444, 511 S.E.2d 48, 54 (1998).  Additionally, situations in which the decision maker has a pecuniary\r\n  interest in the outcome or has been the target of personal abuse or criticism\r\n  from the defendant are such that the adjudicator cannot be said to be\r\n  unbiased.  Withrow v.\r\n    Larkin, 421 U.S. 35, 47 (1975). \r\n  Moreover, &quot;[a]ctual bias or a high probability of bias must be present\r\n  before due process concerns are raised.&quot;  Marshall v. Cuomo, 192\r\n  F.3d 473, 484 (4th Cir. 1999).  We find the ALC did not err in determining\r\n  Shock's DHO was impartial.  First, no evidence shows the DHO had any pecuniary\r\n  interest in Shock's case or that Shock personally abused or criticized the DHO\r\n  in a way as to raise a red flag of potential bias.  Furthermore, we find any\r\n  inaccuracies on Shock's incident report are mere scrivener's errors and do not\r\n  warrant dismissal.  Cf. State v. Bultron, 318 S.C. 323, 329-30,\r\n  457 S.E.2d 616, 620 (Ct. App. 1995) (finding an indictment with a mere\r\n  scrivener's error was not required to be quashed).  Accordingly, the ALC properly\r\n  found the Department did not violate Shock's due process rights.  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nSHORT,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-003","title":"In the Matter of the Care and Treatment of Gilbert Gonzalez","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayUnPubOpinion.cfm?caseNo=2012-UP-003","description":null,"date":"2012-01-04","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n\t\t<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody         { font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif }\r\np.heading    { text-align: center }\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS OPINION HAS NO PRECEDENTIAL\r\n  VALUE.  IT SHOULD NOT BE CITED OR RELIED ON AS PRECEDENT IN ANY PROCEEDING\r\n  EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY RULE 268(d)(2), SCACR.\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Matter of\r\n      the Care and Treatment of Gilbert Gonzalez, Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal from Charleston County\r\nDeadra L.

App. 2008) (citations omitted) (&quot;A jury charge is correct if, when the charge is read as a whole, it contains the correct\r\n  definition and adequately covers the law. To\r\n  warrant reversal, a circuit court[']s refusal to give a requested jury charge must be both erroneous and\r\n  prejudicial to the defendant.&quot;); Davis v.

McCue, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  Auto-Owners Insurance Company appeals from the circuit\r\n  court's determination that the use of a vehicle it insures was causally\r\n  connected to a collision.  We affirm.  \r\nAuto-Owners\r\n  acknowledged that its insured's towed vehicle was &quot;in use&quot; when the\r\n  collision occurred.  As a result, the only question before the circuit court was\r\n  whether a causal connection existed between the vehicle's use and the collision\r\n  that caused Martha Jean Carter's injuries and subsequent death.  \r\nAt\r\n  the time of the collision, Joseph Long was driving a motor home, insured by\r\n  GMAC, and the motor home was towing a Saturn automobile, insured by\r\n  Auto-Owners.  The motor home, tow bar, and Saturn comprised a single vehicular\r\n  unit that was over 50 feet long.  Mr. Long had entered the intersection and was\r\n  attempting to make a left turn onto Northbound US 76 (a four-lane highway\r\n  divided by a 28-foot median) when a collision occurred between Mr. Long's\r\n  vehicular unit and Mrs. Carter's 1996 Chevrolet Suburban SUV.  \r\nWe\r\n  agree with the circuit court's ruling that Mr. Long's use of the Saturn was\r\n  causally connected to the accident because the Saturn and the attached tow bar added\r\n  over 16 feet to the total length of the vehicular unit: when the vehicles\r\n  collided, Mr. Long's vehicular unit was blocking the majority of Southbound US\r\n  76—the direction in which Mrs. Carter was traveling.  Mr. Long's vehicular unit\r\n  was blocking over half the outside, 11-foot, Southbound lane; the entire inside,\r\n  11-foot, Southbound lane, in which Mrs. Carter was traveling; the entire inside,\r\n  10-foot, Southbound turning lane; and 23 feet of the 28-foot median separating\r\n  Southbound and Northbound traffic.  As a witness testified: &quot;At the time\r\n  of the impact, the motor home and Saturn blocked so much of the roadway that M[r]s.\r\n  Carter had nowhere to maneuver to avoid hitting the motor home.&quot; \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities: Gordon\r\n    v. Colonial Ins. Co. of Cal., 342 S.C. 152, 155, 536 S.E.2d 376, 378 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2000) (stating the law of the state in which the insurance policy is\r\n  issued controls the court's interpretation of that policy);[1] State Capital Ins. Co. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 350 S.E.2d 66, 69 (1986)\r\n  (emphasis added) (&quot;[T]he test for determining\r\n  whether an automobile liability policy provides coverage for an accident is not whether the automobile was a\r\n  proximate cause of the accident.  Instead, the test is\r\n  whether there is a causal connection between the use of the automobile\r\n  and the accident.&quot;). \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Here, because Long's Auto-Owners policy was\r\n  issued in North Carolina, the parties stipulated that North Carolina law\r\n  governs the court's interpretation and application of the Auto-Owners policy.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-006","title":"State v.

Young Bros. of Florence, 318 S.C. 207,\r\n  209-10, 456 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1995) (&quot;Rule 4, SCRCP[,] serves at least two purposes.  It confers personal\r\n  jurisdiction on the [family] court and assures the defendant of reasonable\r\n  notice of the action.  We have never required exacting\r\n  compliance with the rules to effect service of process.&quot;); id. at 211, 456 S.E.2d at 900 (&quot;When the\r\n  civil rules on service are followed, there is a presumption of proper\r\n  service.&quot; (internal quotation marks omitted)); Ex parte S.C.

Liverman, 386 S.C. 223, 233, 687 S.E.2d 70,\r\n  75 (Ct. App. 2009).  &quot;An abuse of discretion occurs when the decision of\r\n  the [circuit] court is based upon an error of law or upon factual findings that\r\n  are without evidentiary support.&quot;  Id.  &quot;[W]hether an\r\n  eyewitness identification is sufficiently reliable is a mixed question of law\r\n  and fact.&quot;  State v. Moore, 343 S.C. 282, 288, 540 S.E.2d 445, 448\r\n  (2000).  &quot;In reviewing mixed questions of law and fact, where the evidence\r\n  supports but one reasonable inference, the question becomes a matter of law for\r\n  the court.&quot;  Id.\r\nWhen assessing the\r\n  admissibility of an eyewitness identification &quot;the primary evil to be\r\n  avoided is 'a very substantial likelihood of irreparable\r\n  misidentification.'&quot;  Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 198 (1972)\r\n  (quoting Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384 (1968)).  An unduly\r\n  or unnecessarily suggestive confrontation procedure may deprive a defendant of\r\n  due process of law.  State v. Turner, 373 S.C. 121, 127, 644 S.E.2d 693,\r\n  696 (2007).  However, &quot;the admission of evidence of [an unnecessarily\r\n  suggestive procedure] without more does not violate due process.&quot;  Biggers,\r\n  409 U.S. at 198.  \r\nSingle person show-ups are\r\n  &quot;particularly disfavored in the law&quot; and are suggestive.  Moore,\r\n   343 S.C. at 287, 540 S.E.2d at 448.  If a confrontation procedure is deemed unduly\r\n  suggestive, a court must determine whether &quot;under [the totality of] the\r\n  circumstances the identification was reliable notwithstanding any suggestive\r\n  procedure.&quot;  Id. at 287, S.E.2d at 447-48 (citation and internal\r\n  quotation marks omitted).  Factors to consider in &quot;evaluating the\r\n  likelihood of a misidentification&quot; include the following:\r\n\r\n  [T]he\r\n    opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the\r\n    witness'[s] degree of attention, the accuracy of the witness'[s] prior\r\n    description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness\r\n    at the confrontation, and the length of time between the crime and the\r\n    confrontation.\r\n\r\nBiggers, 409 U.S. at 199-200.\r\nHere, the circuit court did\r\n  not err in admitting the victim's initial show-up identification and subsequent\r\n  in-court identification.  Although the single-person show-up procedure used in\r\n  the instant case has been disfavored as suggestive, the circuit court properly\r\n  found the victim's identification was sufficiently reliable pursuant to the Biggers factors.  The victim was able to view Mitchell's face very closely during the\r\n  carjacking, which took place outside during the day.  In addition, the victim demonstrated\r\n  a high degree of certainty that Mitchell was perpetrator, and both witnesses to\r\n  her initial identification of Mitchell testified she demonstrated no hesitation\r\n  or doubt.  Finally, she identified Mitchell within minutes after the crime. \r\n  Accordingly, Mitchell's carjacking conviction is affirmed.    \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J.,\r\n  THOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Although Mitchell was also convicted of failure to\r\n  stop for a blue light, he does not appeal this conviction.  \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-011","title":"State v.

Florian, of Columbia, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  Michael Wallace appeals an order of the\r\n  Administrative Law Court (ALC), affirming the decision of the South Carolina\r\n  Department of Corrections (the Department) denying Wallace's inmate grievance. \r\n  On appeal, Wallace argues he was not afforded an opportunity for meaningful\r\n  judicial review because the ALC filed the order without allowing Wallace to\r\n  file an appellant's brief.  We agree.\r\n\r\n  The review of the [ALC's] order must be confined to the record. .\r\n    . . The court of appeals may affirm the decision or remand the case for further\r\n    proceedings; or, it may reverse or modify the decision if the substantive\r\n    rights of the petitioner have been prejudiced because the finding, conclusion,\r\n    or decision is . . . in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions.  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. §\r\n  1-23-610(B) (Supp. 2010).  \r\n\r\n  No person shall be finally bound by a judicial or quasi-judicial\r\n    decision of an administrative agency affecting private rights except on due\r\n    notice and an opportunity to be heard . . . nor shall he be deprived of liberty\r\n    or property unless by a mode of procedure prescribed by the General Assembly,\r\n    and he shall have in all such instances the right to judicial review.  \r\n\r\nS.C. Const. art.\r\n  I, § 22.\r\nOur review of the\r\n  record indicates the ALC issued the order affirming the Department's denial of\r\n  Wallace's inmate grievance without the benefit of Wallace's brief.  When the\r\n  ALC issued its order without considering any of Wallace's arguments, Wallace\r\n  was denied the opportunity to be heard and was thus deprived of a liberty\r\n  interest without judicial review.  See Ross v. Med. Univ. of S.C.,\r\n  328 S.C. 51, 68, 492 S.E.2d 62, 71 (1997) (holding article I, section 22 of the\r\n  South Carolina Constitution guarantees persons the right to notice and an\r\n  opportunity to be heard by an administrative agency); see also S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. § 1-23-500 (Supp. 2010) (explaining the ALC is an agency).  Accordingly,\r\n  we reverse and remand[1] with instructions to allow Wallace to file an appellant's brief and proceed\r\n  with his appeal before the ALC.\r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nFEW, C.J.,\r\n  THOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-013","title":"Manley v.

Sifly and RTP\r\n  failed to meet its burden of proof in asserting that KPC's corporate veil\r\n  should be pierced.  See 280 S.C. 453, 457, 313 S.E.2d 316, 318-19 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1984) (finding our courts should apply a two-prong test to determine whether\r\n  a corporate veil should be pierced); Mid-South Mgmt. Co. v. Sherwood Dev.\r\n    Corp., 374 S.C. 588, 597, 649 S.E.2d 135, 140 (Ct. App. 2007) (&quot;The\r\n  burden of proof is on the party asserting that the corporate veil should be\r\n  pierced.&quot;).\r\n2.  RTP asserts Kaveh, as a shareholder\r\n  of Express Mart, owed a fiduciary duty to RTP under the trust fund doctrine.  We\r\n  affirm the trial court's determination that the trust fund doctrine was not\r\n  properly before it in RTP's post-trial brief because RTP did not plead the\r\n  trust fund doctrine in the original complaint or amended complaint, did not\r\n  make a motion to amend its complaint to include it, and the issue was not tried\r\n  by either express or implied consent of the parties.  See Rule 15(a), SCRCP (&quot;A\r\n  party may amend his pleading once as a matter of course at any time before or\r\n  within 30 days after a responsive pleading is served . . . .  Otherwise a party\r\n  may amend his pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the\r\n  adverse party; . . . .&quot;); Rule 15(b), SCRCP (&quot;When issues not raised by\r\n  the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they\r\n  shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.&quot;); Sunvillas Homeowners Ass'n v.

App. 1990) (&quot;Express consent may be demonstrated by a\r\n  stipulation but implied consent depends on whether the parties recognized an\r\n  issue not raised by the pleadings entered the case during the trial.&quot;). \r\n3.  RTP abandoned the issue of damages\r\n  arising from the attachment on Kaveh's property because it failed to cite any\r\n  statute, rule, or legal authority for this issue in its brief.  An issue is\r\n  deemed abandoned if the argument in the brief is not supported by authority or\r\n  is only conclusory.  See Pack v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 381 S.C.\r\n  526, 532, 673 S.E.2d 461, 464 (Ct.

Dangerfield appeals the circuit court's finding that he is liable for a debt\r\n  owed to Adams Outdoor Advertising, LP (Adams) under a contract between the\r\n  parties.  We\r\n  affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nDangerfield\r\n  opened Johnny's Suzuki in Moncks Corner, South Carolina in 2005.  According to Dangerfield,\r\n  Johnny's Suzuki is operated by Johnny's Enterprises, Inc., a South Carolina\r\n  corporation, of which Dangerfield is the registered agent.  Johnny's Suzuki is\r\n  not one of the forty-four South Carolina corporations owned by Dangerfield.  Adams,\r\n  a Minnesota limited partnership authorized to do business in South Carolina,\r\n  provides outdoor advertising to its customers.  On November 21, 2006, Adams\r\n  entered into a written media display contract with Johnny's Suzuki to provide\r\n  outdoor advertising for 52 weeks for $780,000.  The contract listed Johnny's\r\n  Suzuki as the client and was signed by Dangerfield. In August and September\r\n  2007, the parties modified the contract by written agreement, reducing the\r\n  remaining monthly payments from $60,000 to $52,750 and giving Johnny's Suzuki a\r\n  $1,125 credit on the contract amount due. The parties also entered into seven\r\n  purchase agreements.  The purchase agreements listed Johnny's Suzuki as the\r\n  client and were signed by either Dangerfield or Karen Dial.[1]  According to Adams, it received fourteen checks from Johnny's Enterprises, one\r\n  check from Johnny's Subaru &amp; Isuzu, LLC, and two checks from Johnny's\r\n  Subaru Isuzu, totaling $631,207.83.  \r\nOn\r\n  October 21, 2008, Adams filed a complaint alleging Dangerfield breached the\r\n  parties' contract and purchase agreements by failing to make all payments when\r\n  due.  Adams alleged Dangerfield owed $100,317.17 on the contract and $5,600 on\r\n  the purchase agreements.  Dangerfield denied he was a party to the\r\n  contract and purchase agreements (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the\r\n  contracts&quot;) and asserted that Johnny's Enterprises, d/b/a Johnny's Suzuki,\r\n  was the contracting party.  \r\nOn January 21, 2010, a trial was held\r\n  before the circuit court.  In a January 24, 2010 order, the circuit\r\n  court found the contracts were between Dangerfield, d/b/a Johnny's Suzuki, and\r\n  Adams.  The circuit court further determined Dangerfield failed to meet his\r\n  burden of proving his affirmative defense that the contracts were between Adams\r\n  and Johnny's Enterprises.   The court ordered Dangerfield to pay Adams\r\n  $136,637.57, which included the debt owed under the contracts, pre-judgment\r\n  interest, attorney's fees, and costs.  On February 3, 2010, Dangerfield filed a\r\n  motion for reconsideration asserting Adams had the burden of proving the\r\n  contracts were not between Adams and Johnny's Enterprises.  The circuit court denied\r\n  Dangerfield's motion.  \r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\n&quot;An action for breach of contract\r\n  is an action at law.&quot;  Electro Lab of Aiken, Inc. v. Sharp Constr. Co.\r\n    of Sumter, 357 S.C. 363, 367, 593 S.E.2d 170, 172&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004). \r\n  &quot;In an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the\r\n  appellate court's standard of review extends only to the correction of errors\r\n  of law.&quot;  Id.  &quot;The trial judge's findings of fact will not be\r\n  disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably\r\n  supports the judge's findings.&quot;  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Debt\r\n  Liability\r\nDangerfield argues the circuit court\r\n  erred in finding he was personally liable for the debts incurred under the\r\n  contracts.  We disagree.\r\nA.&nbsp; Ambiguity\r\nDangerfield argues &quot;Johnny's Suzuki&quot;\r\n  was an ambiguous term in the contracts, and the circuit court should have\r\n  construed this ambiguity against Adams. At trial, Dangerfield never argued any\r\n  terms of the contracts were ambiguous. Furthermore, the circuit court did not\r\n  make any findings regarding ambiguity in its final order, and Dangerfield\r\n  failed to raise any ambiguity claims in his Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion. \r\n  Accordingly, this issue is not preserved for our review.  See Pye v.\r\n    Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 564-65, 633 S.E.2d 505, 510&nbsp;(2006)\r\n  (holding an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have\r\n  been raised to and ruled upon by the circuit court to be preserved for\r\n  appellate review). \r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Trade Name\r\nDangerfield argues the circuit court\r\n  erred in finding he was personally liable for the debt owed on the contracts because\r\n  Johnny's Suzuki is a trade name of Johnny's Enterprises. Dangerfield contends\r\n  he entered into the contracts as an agent of Johnny's Enterprises, and Adams\r\n  knew Johnny's Suzuki operated under Johnny's Enterprises.  We find Dangerfield\r\n  failed to meet his burden of proving the contracts were between Adams and\r\n  Johnny's Enterprises.  See Cole v. S.C. Elec. &amp; Gas, Inc.,\r\n  362 S.C. 445, 452, 608 S.E.2d 859, 863&nbsp;(2005) (holding a defendant has the\r\n  burden of proving affirmative defenses listed in Rule 8(c), SCRCP).  The name &quot;Johnny's\r\n  Enterprises&quot; does not appear anywhere on the contracts, and Dangerfield\r\n  signed the contracts without any indication he was signing on behalf of\r\n  Johnny's Enterprises.  Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record Adams\r\n  knew Dangerfield was acting on behalf of Johnny's Enterprises.  Although James Cusaac,\r\n  a controller at Adams, testified Adams had done business with Dangerfield in\r\n  the past, he did not testify that those business dealings were with Johnny's\r\n  Enterprises.  There is no evidence Adams previously entered into any contracts\r\n  with Johnny's Enterprises.  Accordingly, we find the circuit court did not err\r\n  in finding Dangerfield personally liable for the debt owed on the contracts.  \r\nII.&nbsp; Novation\r\nDangerfield argues a novation occurred\r\n  when Adams accepted payment from Johnny's Enterprises, thus relieving\r\n  Dangerfield of any personal liability.  Citing Jay Cee Fish Co. v. Cannarella,\r\n  279 F. Supp. 67 (D.S.C. 1968), Dangerfield contends he was relieved of any\r\n  liability for the debt owed on the contracts after Adams accepted checks from\r\n  Johnny's Enterprises, Johnny's Subaru &amp; Isuzu, and Johnny's Subaru Isuzu.  At\r\n  trial, Dangerfield never argued there was a substitution whereby Johnny's Enterprises\r\n  became the new debtor in place of Dangerfield, d/b/a Johnny's Suzuki.  Dangerfield\r\n  maintained the contracts were always between Adams and Johnny's Enterprises,\r\n  d/b/a Johnny's Suzuki.  We also note Dangerfield failed to cite any of the\r\n  novation cases he relies on in his brief to the circuit court.  Because Dangerfield's\r\n  novation argument was never raised to and ruled upon by the circuit court, it\r\n  is not preserved for our review.  See Pye, 369 S.C. at 564-65,\r\n  633 S.E.2d at 510 (holding an issue cannot be raised for the first time on\r\n  appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the circuit court to be\r\n  preserved for appellate review).  Accordingly, the decision of the circuit\r\n  court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, PIEPER, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Although it was\r\n  indicated at oral argument that Dial was an employee of Dangerfield, it is\r\n  unclear from the record what her relationship is to Dangerfield, Johnny's Suzuki,\r\n  or Johnny's Enterprises.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-024","title":"Heos v.

Strickland, Master-in-Equity\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No.  2012-UP-024  \r\n  Heard November 15, 2011 – Filed January\r\n25, 2012\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Eleanor Duffy Cleary, of Columbia, for\r\n          Appellant.\r\n        James B. Richardson, Jr., and S.R.\r\n          Anderson, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  In this foreclosure action, Appellant Alfred Lawton\r\n  (Purchaser) seeks review of a ruling by the Master-in-Equity interpreting an\r\n  installment land contract as requiring Purchaser to pay 22.31 percent interest\r\n  over a twelve-year period.  Purchaser also challenges the master's refusal to\r\n  consider evidence outside the four corners of the contract on the ground that\r\n  the contract is ambiguous.  We affirm.\r\n1.  As to whether the parties' contract unambiguously required\r\n  Purchaser to pay 22.31 percent interest over a twelve-year period, we find no\r\n  error in the master's conclusion.  The contract required Purchaser to make 144\r\n  payments of $500 each, which produces an annualized interest rate of 22.31\r\n  percent.  This precise provision in the contract is clear and cannot be\r\n  dismissed.  It is also reasonable to interpret the provision stating no interest\r\n  is to be paid &quot;on the payments of this contract&quot; as meaning that no\r\n  interest would accrue on late payments.  Rather, a late payment fee of $2.00\r\n  per day would be imposed.  Therefore, the contract is not ambiguous, and the\r\n  master properly found the parties' contract required Purchaser to pay 22.31\r\n  percent interest over a twelve-year period.  See McGill v. Moore, 381\r\n  S.C. 179, 185, 672 S.E.2d 571, 574 (2009) (holding that a contract must\r\n  be read as a whole &quot;so that one may not create an ambiguity by pointing\r\n  out a single sentence or clause&quot;); S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 623, 550\r\n  S.E.2d 299, 302 (2001) (&quot;A\r\n  contract is ambiguous when the terms of the contract are reasonably susceptible\r\n  of more than one interpretation.&quot;).\r\n2.  As to whether the extrinsic written evidence presented by Purchaser\r\n  was barred by the parol evidence rule, we find this evidence post-dated the\r\n  contract, and, thus, was admissible to show a possible modification of the\r\n  contract.  See Adamson v. Marianne Fabrics,\r\n    Inc., 301 S.C. 204, 207, 391 S.E.2d 249,\r\n  251 (1990) (holding that although the terms of a completely integrated\r\n  agreement cannot be varied or contradicted by parol evidence of prior or\r\n  contemporaneous agreements not included in the writing, the rule does not apply\r\n  to subsequent modifications).  \r\nNonetheless, there is no evidence in the record\r\n  showing consideration given in exchange for any possible modification.  See Layman v. State,\r\n  368 S.C. 631, 640, 630 S.E.2d 265, 269 (2006) (&quot;Once the bargain is formed, and the obligations set, a\r\n  contract may only be altered by mutual agreement and for further consideration.&quot;); McPeters v. Yeargin Constr. Co., 290 S.C. 327, 331 350 S.E.2d 208, 211 (Ct. App. 1986) (&quot;Valuable consideration may consist of some\r\n  right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to one party or some forbearance,\r\n  detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other.&quot;). \r\n  Further, Purchaser does not argue the contract was modified, but rather he\r\n  asserts these documents show the intent of the parties at the time they\r\n  executed the contract.  However, because the contract was not ambiguous, the extrinsic\r\n  documents have no probative value as to the parties' intent at the time they\r\n  executed the contract. \r\nBased on the foregoing, the master's error in\r\n  declining to consider the extrinsic documents that post-dated the contract is\r\n  not reversible.  See Jensen v.

Easterling, of Greenville, for\r\n          Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  This\r\n  appeal arises out of the denial of Appellant Goldie Woodie's claim for benefits\r\n  by the Workers' Compensation Commission (the Commission).  The circuit court\r\n  affirmed the denial by the Commission.  On appeal, Woodie claims the circuit\r\n  court erred in:  (1) finding the hernia statute precludes benefits for a hernia\r\n  aggravated by a work-related injury and (2) making a gratuitous finding that\r\n  even if the rules of statutory construction require a distinction between\r\n  &quot;hernia&quot; and &quot;rupture,&quot; the facts do not support such a\r\n  distinction.  We affirm.\r\n1. As to Woodie's argument that the\r\n  court erred in finding section 42-9-40 (1985) prevents recovery, we find no\r\n  error of law and substantial evidence in the record on appeal to support the\r\n  finding of the Commission that Woodie failed to carry his burden of proving he\r\n  suffered a compensable hernia.  See S.C. Code Ann. § 42-9-40(5)\r\n  (&quot;In all claims for compensation from hernia or rupture, resulting\r\n  from injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employee's employment,\r\n  it must be definitely proved to the satisfaction of the Commission . . . [t]hat\r\n  the hernia or rupture did not exist prior to the accident for which\r\n  compensation is claimed.&quot;) (emphasis added); Jordan v. Kelly Co.,\r\n  381 S.C. 483, 487, 674 S.E.2d 166, 169 (2009) (&quot;Although the record\r\n  contains conflicting evidence, this Court is not in a position to weigh the\r\n  evidence presented in [a] workers' compensation hearing.&quot;); ESA Servs.,\r\n    LLC v. S.C.

Badger R. Bazen Co., 388 S.C. 58, 65, 693 S.E.2d 436, 440 (Ct. App. 2010)\r\n  (noting only issues raised to and ruled upon by the Commission are cognizable\r\n  on appeal); Pye v.

Graddick, 345 S.C.\r\n  383, 386, 548 S.E.2d 210, 211 (2001) (noting the defendant bears the burden of\r\n  showing satisfactory cause for removal); id. (finding the trial court\r\n  did not err in denying the defendant's motion to relieve counsel when defendant\r\n  alleged counsel was not representing his interests, counsel was not fully\r\n  prepared for the case, and defendant did not feel comfortable going to court\r\n  with counsel as his lawyer); State v. Hyman, 276 S.C. 559, 562, 281\r\n  S.E.2d 209, 211 (1981), overruled on other grounds by State v.\r\n    Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991) (finding the trial court did\r\n  not abuse his discretion in denying the defendant's motion to relieve counsel\r\n  based on the defendant's allegation that counsel was &quot;not up to date on\r\n  the law&quot;); State v. Yarborough, 363 S.C. 260, 266, 609 S.E.2d 592,\r\n  595 (Ct. App. 2005) (&quot;The granting of a motion for a continuance is within\r\n  the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent a\r\n  clear showing of an abuse of discretion.&quot;); State v.

(&quot;Reversals of refusal of a continuance are about as rare as\r\n  the proverbial hens' teeth.&quot;).  \r\n2. As to\r\n  whether the trial court erred in admitting drug evidence because the chain of\r\n  custody was allegedly insufficient: State\r\n    v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 694 (2003) (&quot;A party may\r\n  not argue one ground at trial and an alternate ground on appeal.&quot;); State\r\n    v.

Benton,\r\n  338 S.C. 151, 157, 526 S.E.2d 228, 231 (2000) (finding an argument in support\r\n  of a jury charge on one ground was not preserved because appellant had argued\r\n  for the charge based on a different ground at trial); State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 208, 631 S.E.2d 262,\r\n  265&nbsp;(2006) (&quot;The admission of evidence is within the discretion of\r\n  the trial court and will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.&quot;); id.

Dean, all of Columbia; and Mark Phillips,\r\n          of Charleston, for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  Appellants/Respondents Fariborz Babaee and Malihe\r\n  Babaee (the Babaees) brought this breach of warranty action against\r\n  Respondent/Appellant Moisture Warranty Corporation (Moisture Warranty) to\r\n  recover damages for Moisture Warranty's refusal to pay the full cost of repairs\r\n  to the Babaees' home after it sustained moisture damage.  The circuit court\r\n  granted Moisture Warranty's motion for a directed verdict on the Babaees'\r\n  claims for fraud and violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act\r\n  (UTPA), S.C. Code Ann. §§ 39-5-10 to -560 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2010).  The jury\r\n  returned a verdict for the Babaees in the amount of $140,000 on their breach of\r\n  warranty claim.  The circuit court granted Moisture Warranty's motion for a new\r\n  trial nisi remittitur, reduced the verdict to $20,000, and denied Moisture\r\n  Warranty's motions for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) and new\r\n  trial absolute.  The Babaees appeal, and Moisture Warranty cross-appeals.  We\r\n  affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.     \r\n1.&nbsp; As to the reduction of the jury's verdict,\r\n  we disagree with the Babaees' argument that this reduction was based on\r\n  warranty terms to which they did not agree.  Significantly, when the Babaees\r\n  closed on the purchase of their home, they were provided with Moisture\r\n  Warranty's Letter of Approval, which indicated the home qualified for a\r\n  warranty against moisture damage, with one exclusion.  The Letter of Approval\r\n  indicated the &quot;level of warranty chosen&quot; was a three-year warranty\r\n  with a total limit of $60,000 and a $20,000 annual limit.  The Babaees signed\r\n  the Letter of Approval, just below the following statement: &quot;I have read\r\n  and understand this Letter of Approval dated 11/11/04 and the Moisture Warranty\r\n  Terms and Conditions.  I accept the warranty and any exclusions listed for the\r\n  home . . . .&quot;[1]  \r\nThe\r\n  language in the Letter of Approval was clear and unambiguous in its expression\r\n  of coverage limits and in its incorporation of the Terms and Limitations\r\n  document, which also set forth coverage limits of $20,000 per year for a total\r\n  of $60,000 over the full term of the warranty.  Further, the warranty stated it\r\n  did not cover consequential damages.  Therefore, the circuit court properly\r\n  considered the warranty's coverage limits in granting Moisture Warranty's\r\n  motion to reduce the jury's verdict.  See S.C. Dep't of Natural Res.\r\n    v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 623, 550 S.E.2d 299, 303 (2001)\r\n  (holding that the determination of the parties' intent is a question of fact\r\n  only when the language of a contract is ambiguous); Becker v. Wal-Mart\r\n    Stores, Inc., 339 S.C. 629, 637, 529 S.E.2d 758, 762 (Ct. App. 2000)\r\n  (&quot;The trial court has wide discretionary power to reduce the amount of a\r\n  verdict which in his or her judgment is excessive.&quot;) (citation and\r\n  quotation marks omitted).  We affirm the trial court's reduction of the jury's\r\n  verdict to the limits stated in the Letter of Approval.\r\n2. As to the directed verdict for Moisture\r\n  Warranty on the UTPA claim, we find more than one\r\n  reasonable inference exists as to: (1) the deceptive nature of the\r\n  representations in Moisture Warranty's advertising brochure; (2) the  potential\r\n  for repetition; and (3) the existence of damages proximately caused by a UTPA\r\n  violation, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Babaees.    \r\nInitially, Moisture\r\n  Warranty contends the Babaees did not appeal the directed verdict on their UTPA\r\n  claim.  Moisture Warranty argues the Babaees' notice of appeal, which was filed\r\n  on March 5, 2009, did not comply with Rule 203(e)(1)(c), SCACR,[2] because it did not reference the\r\n  circuit court's November 21, 2008 judgment, which was entered on (1) the jury's verdict on the breach of warranty claim and\r\n  (2) the directed verdict on the UTPA and fraud claims.  However, the circuit\r\n  court's February 16, 2009 order granting Moisture Warranty's motion for a new\r\n  trial nisi modified the November 21, 2008 judgment; thus, the February 16, 2009\r\n  order served as the circuit court's final judgment in this action.  See Rule\r\n  59(e), SCRCP (allowing for a motion to alter or amend a judgment)\r\n  (emphasis added); cf. Rule 59(f), SCRCP (stating that the time for appeal for all parties shall run\r\n  from the receipt of written notice of entry of the order granting or denying\r\n    a timely motion under Rule 59)\r\n  (emphasis added).  \r\nIn any event, Moisture\r\n  Warranty has not shown any prejudice resulting from the omission of the date of\r\n  the initial judgment.  Accordingly, the omission is of a clerical nature only.  Cf. Weatherford v. Price, 340 S.C. 572, 577-78, 532 S.E.2d 310, 313&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2000)&nbsp;(rejecting\r\n  the respondent's argument that the appellant failed to appeal the final order in\r\n  an action tried non-jury by referring only to the order denying the motion for\r\n  reconsideration in his notice of appeal because the respondent was not\r\n  prejudiced and the appellant attached a copy of the final order to his notice\r\n  of appeal).  Therefore, the reference in\r\n  the Babaees' notice of appeal to the February 16, 2009 order was effective to perfect\r\n  their appeal of all rulings arising from this action.\r\nAs to the merits\r\n  of this assignment of error, the brochure in question stated in pertinent part:\r\n  &quot;We know what steps to take to assure homeowners that their home is dry,\r\n  and we guarantee their home will remain dry during the term of the warranty . .\r\n  . or we'll pay to get it dry.&quot;  At trial, the Babaees presented a document\r\n  prepared by the Clemson Extension Service that explained wood moisture content.  The document stated that a wood\r\n  moisture content of 20% to 24% indicates a serious excessive moisture problem\r\n  and described the 25% to 30% level of wood moisture as often being &quot;the\r\n  'too late' level for correcting problem situations without repair costs in the\r\n  thousands of dollars.&quot;  However, the warranty\r\n  defined &quot;excessive moisture&quot; as any moisture reading equal to\r\n  or above 25%.  In light of this contrast, the use of\r\n  the term &quot;dry&quot; in Moisture Warranty's brochure is troubling.  \r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, we hold the circuit court erred in granting a directed verdict for\r\n  Moisture Warranty on the UTPA claim.  See Parrish v. Allison, 376\r\n  S.C. 308, 319, 656 S.E.2d 382, 388 (Ct. App. 2007) (&quot;[I]f the evidence as\r\n  a whole is susceptible of more than one reasonable inference, a jury issue is\r\n  created and the motion should be denied.&quot;); The Huffines Co., LLC v.\r\n    Lockhart, 365 S.C. 178, 187, 617 S.E.2d 125, 129 (Ct. App. 2005) (holding\r\n  that in ruling on motions for a directed verdict or JNOV, the trial court is\r\n  required to view the evidence and reasonable inferences from the evidence in\r\n  the light most favorable to the party opposing the motions).  We reverse this\r\n  directed verdict and remand for a new trial on the UTPA claim. \r\n3.&nbsp; As to the denial of Moisture\r\n  Warranty's motions for a directed verdict and JNOV, we find the evidence to be\r\n  susceptible to more than one reasonable inference regarding: (1) the existence\r\n  of an offer to repair; (2) the Babaees' alleged rejection of any such offer;\r\n  and (3) whether Moisture Warranty's tender of $2,500 was adequate to fulfill its\r\n  obligations under the terms of the warranty.  Therefore, we affirm on this\r\n  assignment of error.\r\n4.&nbsp; As to the exclusion of evidence of\r\n  the $110,000 credit given by the sellers toward the home's purchase price, we\r\n  find this evidence does not tend to make more or less probable the\r\n  establishment of damages proximately caused by a breach of warranty.[3] \r\n  Therefore, the evidence is not relevant.  See Rule 401, SCRE (defining\r\n  &quot;relevant evidence&quot;).  Further, this evidence is prohibited by the\r\n  collateral source rule.  See Giannini v. S.C. Dep't of Transp.,\r\n  378 S.C. 573, 582-83, 664 S.E.2d 450, 455 (2008) (holding that the collateral\r\n  source rule prohibited a jury instruction on the income tax consequences of a\r\n  personal injury award); New Found. Baptist Church v. Davis, 257 S.C.\r\n  443, 446, 186 S.E.2d 247, 249 (1972) (holding that compensation received by an\r\n  injured party from a collateral source, wholly independent of the wrongdoer,\r\n  does not operate to lessen the damages recoverable from the wrongdoer).  We\r\n  affirm the circuit court's exclusion of this evidence.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, we affirm: (1) the circuit court's order reducing the jury's verdict\r\n  on the breach of warranty claim; (2) the circuit court's exclusion of evidence regarding\r\n  the purpose for the $110,000 reduction in the home's purchase price; and (3) the\r\n  denial of Moisture Warranty's motions for a directed verdict and JNOV.  We,\r\n  however, reverse the directed verdict on the UTPA claim and remand for a new\r\n  trial on this claim.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED\r\n  IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, and\r\n  GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The document in question is entitled &quot;The Terms\r\n  and Limitations of the MoistureFree Warranty.&quot;  Thus, we will refer to\r\n  this document as &quot;the Terms and Limitations document.&quot;  The Babaees\r\n  contend the circuit court found in a pre-trial order that they did not receive\r\n  the Terms and Limitations document until after they purchased the home. \r\n  We disagree with the Babaees' characterization of this order, which merely\r\n  recited the Babaees' allegation regarding their receipt of the document.\r\n[2] Rule 203(e)(1)(c), SCACR, requires the Notice of\r\n  Appeal to include the date of the order or judgment from which the appeal is\r\n  taken.\r\n[3] The record shows the sellers gave this credit to the\r\n  Babaees for the purpose of stucco repairs or replacement.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-031","title":"Cramer v.

Summers and Katherine A. Phillips,\r\n          both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In\r\n  this inmate grievance case, Joshua Cramer appeals an Administrative Law Court's\r\n  (ALC) affirmation of the South Carolina Department of Corrections's\r\n  (Department) denial of his grievance regarding wages he earned while employed\r\n  in a prison industries project operated by the Department at Broad River\r\n  Correctional Institution.  We vacate and remand.[1]\r\nCramer is an inmate sentenced\r\n  to life imprisonment without parole.  He is currently incarcerated at the Broad\r\n  River Correctional Institution and participates in a prison industries project\r\n  making hardwood flooring.  He began employment with the project on May 2,\r\n  2005.  On April 26, 2007, Cramer filed a grievance labeled BRCI-0594-07.  In\r\n  this grievance, Cramer asserted a claim for back pay based on the Department's\r\n  failure to pay him the prevailing wage in the private sector for his work\r\n  performed in the prison industries project and a claim for immediate access to\r\n  his wages held in escrow pursuant to section 24-3-40(B) of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (2007).[2] \r\n  The Department failed to issue a decision on this grievance, so Cramer filed a\r\n  subsequent grievance labeled BRCI-0015-08 on December 24, 2007.  In this\r\n  grievance, Cramer claimed the Department's failure to issue a decision on his\r\n  initial grievance violated the Department's policy providing for the resolution\r\n  of grievances within 180 days and requested the Department address his claims\r\n  presented in his initial grievance.  On June 11, 2008, the Department issued a\r\n  final decision denying grievance BRCI-0015-08 and stating that his initial\r\n  grievance BRCI-0594-07 was being held in abeyance until the appropriate\r\n  personnel obtained all the necessary information for processing his\r\n  grievance.     \r\nCramer appealed the denial of\r\n  his grievance BRCI-0015-08 to the ALC.  Cramer asked the ALC &quot;to take\r\n  jurisdiction of my original grievance BR-0594-07 and resolve all my issues set\r\n  forth in my original grievance.&quot;  In his brief to the ALC, Cramer asserted\r\n  the claims presented in his original grievance BRCI-0594-07, claiming he was\r\n  entitled to back pay because the Department erred by not paying him the\r\n  prevailing wage for his work and that the Department erred by denying him\r\n  immediate access to his escrowed wages in violation of section 24-3-40(B).  The\r\n  ALC found the Department had denied Cramer's grievance BRCI-0594-07 and affirmed\r\n  the Department's denial of the grievance, finding the wages paid to Cramer were\r\n  proper under South Carolina case and statutory law and that Cramer was not\r\n  entitled to immediate access to his escrowed wages pursuant to section\r\n  24-3-40(B).  In addition, the ALC found Cramer's claims were barred by the\r\n  doctrine of laches and Cramer's failure to file a timely grievance pursuant to\r\n  the Department's procedural requirements.  This appeal followed.\r\nAlthough &quot;confined to\r\n  the record,&quot; the court of appeals has the authority to review a decision\r\n  of the ALC in order to determine whether &quot;the substantive rights of the\r\n  petitioner have been prejudiced because the finding, conclusion, or decision is\r\n  . . . in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; . . . affected by\r\n  other error of law; . . . [or] arbitrary or capricious or characterized by\r\n  abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.&quot;  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. § 1-23-610(B) (Supp. 2010).  The ALC's factual findings must stand\r\n  unless they are &quot;clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and\r\n  substantial evidence on the whole record.&quot;  Id.; see also Al-Shabazz\r\n    v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 380, 527 S.E.2d 742, 756 (2000) (&quot;It has long\r\n  been established that the court may not substitute its judgment for that of an\r\n  agency on questions of fact when those facts are supported by substantial\r\n  evidence.&quot;).  \r\nThe ALC &quot;shall preside\r\n  over all appeals from final decisions of contested cases.&quot;  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  § 1-23-600(D) (Supp. 2010).  A &quot;contested case&quot; is defined as a\r\n  proceeding &quot;in which the legal rights, duties, or privileges of a party\r\n  are required by law to be determined by an agency after an opportunity for\r\n  hearing.&quot;  S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-310(3) (2005); see also Al-Shabazz,\r\n  338 S.C. at 375, 527 S.E.2d at 753 (&quot;An inmate brings a contested case for\r\n  purposes of judicial review when he challenges a disciplinary outcome,\r\n  calculation of sentence-related credits, custody status, or other condition of\r\n  imprisonment.&quot;).  Accordingly, &quot;the AL[C] has subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction to hear appeals from the final decision of the [Department] in a\r\n  non-collateral or administrative matter.&quot; Slezak v. S.C. Dep't of Corr.,\r\n  361 S.C. 327, 331, 605 S.E.2d 506, 507 (2004).  \r\nIn its order, the ALC found\r\n  &quot;[o]n June 11, 2008, the Department issued its final decision and denied\r\n  all claims raised by Cramer in both grievances.&quot;  This finding is\r\n  unsupported by the evidence.  The decision referenced by the ALC was issued in\r\n  response to Cramer's grievance BRCI-0015-08, in which he complained that the\r\n  Department had not responded to his initial grievance regarding the issues of\r\n  back pay and his access to his escrowed wages.  The Department did not issue a\r\n  final decision on Cramer's grievance BRCI-0594-07 and, in fact, explicitly\r\n  stated that grievance was held in abeyance until the inmate grievance\r\n  coordinator received all the necessary information for processing the\r\n  grievance.  The record contains no evidence the Department ever issued a decision\r\n  on Cramer's initial grievance, BRCI-0594-07, regarding his claims to back pay\r\n  and immediate access to his escrowed wages.  Because the Department never\r\n  issued a final decision on those issues, the ALC erred in asserting\r\n  jurisdiction over the claims presented in Cramer's initial grievance. \r\n  Accordingly, the ALC's order is vacated, and this case is remanded with\r\n  instructions for the ALC to consider only the issue raised in Cramer's\r\n  grievance BRCI-0015-08, namely the Department's failure to timely respond to\r\n  Cramer's initial grievance.     \r\nVACATED AND REMANDED.\r\nFEW, C.J.,\r\n  THOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Section 24-3-40(B) provides in relevant part: &quot;The\r\n  Department of Corrections shall return a prisoner's wages held in escrow\r\n  pursuant to subsection (A) as follows: . . .

Phillips appeals the circuit court's order finding he defaulted on a\r\n  promissory note.  On appeal, Phillips argues the circuit court erred in finding\r\n  (1) the interest rate pursuant to the\r\n  promissory note was fifteen percent per annum and (2) an $8,500 payment from\r\n  Sharron R. Latta constituted an advancement under the promissory note.  We reverse.[1]\r\n1.  &quot;One cardinal\r\n  rule of contract interpretation is to ascertain and give effect to the\r\n  intention of the parties.&quot;  S.C. Dep't of Transp. v. M &amp; T Enters.\r\n    of Mount Pleasant, LLC, 379 S.C. 645, 655, 667 S.E.2d 7, 12&nbsp;(Ct. App.\r\n  2008) (citation omitted).  &quot;To determine the intention of the parties, the\r\n  court must first look at the language of the contract.&quot;  Id. at\r\n  655, 667 S.E.2d at 12-13 (citation and quotation marks omitted).  &quot;The construction of a clear\r\n  and unambiguous contract presents a question of law for the court.&quot;  Id. at 655, 667 S.E.2d at 13 (citation omitted).  &quot;Questions of law may be\r\n  decided with no particular deference to the [circuit] court.&quot;  Id. at 654, 667\r\n  S.E.2d at 12 (citation omitted).  &quot;It is also a question of law whether\r\n  the language of a contract is ambiguous.&quot;  Id. at 655, 667 S.E.2d\r\n  at 13 (citation omitted).  &quot;When a contract is unambiguous, clear, and\r\n  explicit, it must be construed according to the terms the parties have used, to\r\n  be taken and understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense.&quot;  Id.  &quot;Where an agreement is clear and capable of legal construction, the court's\r\n  only function is to interpret its lawful meaning and the intention of the parties\r\n  as found within the agreement and give effect to it.&quot;  Id. (citation\r\n  omitted).  &quot;A court must enforce an unambiguous contract according to its\r\n  terms regardless of its wisdom or folly, apparent unreasonableness, or the\r\n  parties' failure to guard their rights carefully.&quot;  Id. (citation\r\n  omitted).  \r\nWe find the circuit court\r\n  erred in determining the promissory note set forth an annual fifteen percent\r\n  interest rate.  In this case, the promissory note provides that the interest\r\n  will be fifteen percent of the $100,000 principal, payable at the closing of\r\n  the house built on lot #6.  Thus, under the plain and unambiguous terms of the\r\n  promissory note, Latta was entitled to $15,000- in interest at the house\r\n  closing in August of 2006.  Accordingly, the circuit court erred in finding\r\n  Phillips accumulated $40,322.60 in interest based on an annual accrual rate of\r\n  fifteen percent.  \r\nThe contract was silent as to\r\n  the interest rate upon defaulting on a promissory note.  Nonetheless, the\r\n  circuit court erred in determining the interest rate for default was fifteen\r\n  percent per annum.  South Carolina's courts have held that the interest rate\r\n  for default when the contract is silent about default shall be the statutory\r\n  legal interest rate.  See Langston v. S.C. R.R.,&nbsp;2 S.C. 248,\r\n  254 (1871).  Accordingly, we reverse and remand to the circuit court to\r\n  recalculate the interest Phillips accrued on the default of the promissory\r\n  note. \r\n2.  We affirm the\r\n  circuit court's finding that an $8,500 payment from Latta constituted an\r\n  advancement under the promissory note.  The evidence before this court supports\r\n  the circuit court's finding that the operative language of the promissory note\r\n  did not limit Phillips's obligation to repay only those advancements that were\r\n  used for the construction of a home identified in the promissory note.  \r\nAFFIRMED IN\r\n  PART, REVERSED IN\r\n    PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nFEW, C.J., and\r\n  THOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-037","title":"Livingston v.

(citation omitted).\r\nWhen assessing the\r\n  admissibility of an eyewitness identification, &quot;the primary evil to be\r\n  avoided is 'a very substantial likelihood of irreparable\r\n  misidentification.'&quot;  Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 198 (1972)\r\n  (quoting Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384 (1968)).  An unduly\r\n  or unnecessarily suggestive procedure may deprive a defendant of due process of\r\n  law.  State v. Turner, 373 S.C. 121, 127, 644 S.E.2d 693, 696 (2007)\r\n  (citation omitted).  However, &quot;the admission of evidence of [an\r\n  unnecessarily suggestive procedure] without more does not violate due\r\n  process.&quot;  Biggers, 409 U.S. at 198.  \r\nAccordingly, a court must\r\n  apply a two-prong test.  Moore, 343 S.C. at 287, 540 S.E.2d at 447. \r\n  First, it must determine whether the confrontation procedure used by the police\r\n  was unduly suggestive.  Id.  Only if the procedure was unduly suggestive\r\n  must a court focus on the second prong:  whether &quot;'under [the totality of]\r\n  the circumstances the identification was reliable notwithstanding any\r\n  suggestive procedure.'&quot;  Id. at 287, S.E.2d at 447-48 (citation\r\n  omitted).  Factors to consider in &quot;evaluating the likelihood of a\r\n  misidentification&quot; include the following:\r\n\r\n  [T]he\r\n    opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the\r\n    witness'[s] degree of attention, the accuracy of the witness'[s] prior description\r\n    of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the\r\n    confrontation, and the length of time between the crime and the confrontation.\r\n\r\nBiggers, 409 U.S. at 199-200; see also Turner,\r\n  373 S.C. at 127, 644 S.E.2d at 696-97.\r\nHere, the circuit court\r\n  admitted two in-court eyewitness identifications of Tobbie after finding the\r\n  confrontation procedures, both one-man show-ups, were unduly suggestive.  We\r\n  find the first identification, made by a convenience store employee, to be sufficiently\r\n  reliable under the Biggers analysis.  Initially, we note Tobbie's statement\r\n  to law enforcement that he was present during the crime shows an absence of\r\n  prejudice and unlikelihood of misidentification.  Regardless, the employee,\r\n  first, had the opportunity to observe Tobbie on two occasions: as he entered\r\n  the store and as he was getting into the backseat of a car.  The employee\r\n  testified she got a good look at Tobbie at the well-lit gas station as she\r\n  checked the trashcans outside.  Specifically, she testified she was suspicious\r\n  of Tobbie and his codefendant because his codefendant would not make eye\r\n  contact with her.  Second, she claimed she was &quot;99 percent sure&quot;\r\n  Tobbie was at the gas station with his codefendant when she identified him\r\n  &quot;a little while&quot; later.  Finally, her testimony of the suspect's\r\n  features observed by her at the gas station were consistent with Tobbie's despite\r\n  the fact he was wearing a different shirt when he was apprehended.\r\nFurthermore, we find the\r\n  issue as to the reliability of the second identification, made by the victim's\r\n  friend, unpreserved because of Tobbie's failure to make a contemporaneous\r\n  objection.  See State v. Burton, 326 S.C. 605, 609, 486 S.E.2d\r\n  762, 764 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\n2.&nbsp; An appellate court reviews the\r\n  denial of a directed verdict by viewing the evidence and all reasonable\r\n  inferences in the light most favorable to the State.  State v. Weston,\r\n  367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006).  &quot;If there is any direct\r\n  evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove\r\n  the guilt of the accused, [an appellate court] must find the case was properly\r\n  submitted to the jury.&quot;  Id. at 292-93, 625 S.E.2d at 648.  The\r\n  circuit court may not consider the weight of the evidence.  Id. at 292,\r\n  625 S.E.2d at 648.  Additionally, a motion for a\r\n  directed verdict must be granted if the State fails to present evidence venue\r\n  was proper.  State v. Evans, 307 S.C. 477, 480, 415 S.E.2d 816, 818\r\n  (1992) (&quot;[A] criminal defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the\r\n  State fails to present evidence that the offense was committed in the county\r\n  alleged in the indictment.&quot;) (citing State v. McCoy, 98 S.C. 133,\r\n  82 S.E. 280 (1914))), overruled in part by State v. Gentry, 363\r\n  S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005).\r\nHere, the State presented\r\n  evidence the principal felonies, attempted armed robbery and assault and\r\n  battery with intent to kill, were committed in York County.  Because an\r\n  accessory after the fact may be indicted and tried in the county where the\r\n  principal felony was committed, we find the circuit court did not err in\r\n  submitting the charge to the jury.  S.C.

Code Ann. § 16-23-20 (Supp. 2010). \r\n  There are exceptions in the statute, one of which is &quot;a person in a\r\n  vehicle if the handgun is . . . secured in a closed glove compartment, closed\r\n  console, closed trunk, or in a closed container secured by an integral fastener\r\n  and transported in the luggage compartment of the vehicle . . . .&quot;  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. § 16-23-20(9)(a) (Supp. 2010).  In the instant case, sufficient circumstantial\r\n  evidence supports a finding that Reames knowingly carried a pistol in the side\r\n  pocket of the driver-side door of the vehicle she was driving.  Because the\r\n  pistol was not in a lawful location pursuant to section 16-23-20, the trial\r\n  court properly denied Reames's motion for a directed verdict.   See State v. Weston,\r\n  367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006) (holding when ruling on a motion\r\n  for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence or\r\n  nonexistence of evidence, not its weight).\r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nFEW, C.J.,\r\n  THOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-041","title":"State v.

Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 198 (1972)\r\n  (quoting Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384 (1968)).  An unduly\r\n  or unnecessarily suggestive confrontation procedure may deprive a defendant of\r\n  due process of law.  State v.

Pachak, of\r\n          Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Alan Wilson, Chief Deputy\r\n          Attorney General John W.

Walter Wilkins, III, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  Oshaun\r\n  J. Robinson appeals his convictions for armed robbery, possession of a weapon\r\n  during the commission of a violent crime, conspiracy, and assault and battery of\r\n  a high and aggravated nature.  He argues the&nbsp;trial court committed\r\n  reversible error in precluding him from cross-examining a witness for the State\r\n  regarding the sentence he received for charges arising from the same incident. \r\n  We affirm.[1]\r\nThe Confrontation\r\n  Clause of the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides: \r\n  &quot;In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to\r\n  be confronted with the witnesses against him.&quot;  This encompasses the right\r\n  to &quot;meaningful cross-examination of adverse witnesses[,]&quot; including\r\n  the right to cross-examine a witness concerning bias.  State v. Graham,\r\n  314 S.C. 383, 385, 444 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1994).  This right to cross-examination\r\n  entails the &quot;right to cross-examine any State's witness as to possible\r\n  sentences faced when there exists a substantial possibility the witness would\r\n  give biased testimony in an effort to have the solicitor highlight to a future\r\n  court how the witness cooperated in the instant case.&quot;  State v.\r\n    Gillian, 360 S.C. 433, 454, 602 S.E.2d 62, 73 (Ct. App. 2004), aff'd as\r\n      modified by State v. Gillian, 373 S.C. 601, 646 S.E.2d 872 (2007)\r\n  (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  &quot;A criminal defendant\r\n  states a violation of the Confrontation Clause by showing that he was\r\n  prohibited from engaging in otherwise appropriate cross-examination\r\n  designed to show a prototypical form of bias on the part of the witness . . .\r\n  .&quot;  Graham, 314 S.C. at 385, 444 S.E.2d at 527 (quoting Delaware\r\n    v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 680 (1986)).  \r\n\r\n  The Confrontation Clause does not, however, prevent a trial\r\n    [court] from imposing any limits on defense counsel's inquiry into the\r\n    potential bias of a prosecution witness.  On the contrary, trial [courts]\r\n    retain wide latitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose\r\n    reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on concerns about, among\r\n    other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, witness' safety,\r\n    or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant. \r\n\r\nId. (quoting Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at\r\n  679).        \r\n&quot;A violation\r\n  of the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confront the witness is not per se\r\n  reversible error if the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot;  State\r\n    v. Gillian, 360 S.C. 433, 454, 602 S.E.2d 62, 73 (Ct. App. 2004) (internal\r\n  quotation marks and emphasis omitted).  &quot;Harmless beyond a reasonable\r\n  doubt means the reviewing court can conclude the error did not contribute to\r\n  the verdict beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot;  Id. at 455, 602 S.E.2d at\r\n  74 (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\n  Whether an error is harmless depends on the particular facts of\r\n    each case and upon a host of factors, including:\r\n  the importance of the witness' testimony in the prosecution's\r\n    case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence\r\n    corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points,\r\n    the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and of course the overall\r\n    strength of the prosecution's case.\r\n\r\nId. at 455, 602 S.E.2d at 73-74 (quoting State\r\n  v. Mizzell, 349 S.C. 326, 333, 563 S.E.2d 315, 318-19 (2002)).   \r\nHere, although the trial\r\n  court precluded Robinson from cross-examining a witness for the State regarding\r\n  the specific sentence he received for charges arising from the same incident,\r\n  the court allowed extensive cross-examination of the witness regarding every\r\n  other aspect of potential bias arising from his cooperation with the State. \r\n  Accordingly, we find that, to the extent the trial court erred by precluding\r\n  evidence of the witness's specific sentence, the error was harmless because\r\n  such evidence was cumulative and could not reasonably have affected the result\r\n  of the trial.        \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-043","title":"State v.

Dudek, of Columbia, for\r\n  Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Alan Wilson, Chief Deputy Attorney General John\r\n  W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, all of\r\n  Columbia; and Solicitor J. Gregory Hembree, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: \r\n  Anthony Quentin Scott was convicted of murder in the death of Efrain Rosado\r\n  (Victim), and now appeals that conviction asserting (1) he was entitled to a\r\n  directed verdict, as there was insufficient direct or substantial\r\n  circumstantial evidence he was responsible for the murder and (2) he was\r\n  entitled to an instruction on &quot;criminal intent,&quot; which he did not\r\n  receive.  We affirm.\r\nWe\r\n  find no error in the trial court's denial of Scott's motion for directed\r\n  verdict.  &quot;A case should be submitted to the jury when the evidence is\r\n  circumstantial 'if there is any substantial evidence which reasonably tends to\r\n  prove the guilt of the accused or from which his guilt may be fairly and\r\n  logically deduced.'&quot;  State v. Bostick, 392 S.C. 134, 139, 708\r\n  S.E.2d 774, 776 (2011) (quoting State v. Mitchell, 341 S.C. 406, 409,\r\n  535 S.E.2d 126, 127 (2000)).  On appeal of the denial of a directed verdict of\r\n  acquittal, the appellate court must look at the evidence in the light most\r\n  favorable to the State, and absent a total failure of competent evidence as to\r\n  the charges alleged, refusal by the trial judge to direct a verdict of\r\n  acquittal must be affirmed.  Id.  at 139, 708 S.E.2d at 776-77.  Viewing\r\n  the evidence in the case at hand in the light most favorable to the State, the\r\n  State presented the following substantial circumstantial evidence which\r\n  reasonably tended to prove Scott's guilt:  (1) On the evening of, and prior to\r\n  Victim being shot, Williams and Scott arrived at Rudy's residence, nearby\r\n  Victim's home, and Williams was heard on the phone, upset and addressing Victim\r\n  by his name, stating &quot;you don't play me like that,&quot; exclaiming on the\r\n  phone, &quot;I don't appreciate the way you talking to me, and, matter of fact,\r\n  I might come down there right now,&quot; and then immediately telling Scott to\r\n  leave with him, at which point Scott and co-defendant Williams left; (2) Scott\r\n  and Williams were driving a white Ford Escort that night, and when they left\r\n  Rudy's residence, the car was observed heading toward Victim's house and the\r\n  car's brake lights came on when it pulled in front of Victim's house; (3)\r\n  within thirty minutes of Williams and Scott leaving Rudy's and heading toward\r\n  Victim's house, Victim was discovered in his injured condition; (4) shortly\r\n  after Rudy found the injured Victim, Scott and Williams returned to Rudy's\r\n  home, where they were observed carrying guns, and Scott in particular was seen\r\n  carrying a rifle which was identified as the one found in the wood line behind\r\n  Williams' mother's home at the time Williams and Scott were located and\r\n  arrested at the home; (5) the bullet causing the fatal injury to Victim,\r\n  although not conclusively matched to the rifle in question, was determined to have\r\n  been fired from a weapon similar to the rifle carried by Scott that night; (6)\r\n  two shell casings were recovered from the white Ford Escort belonging to and\r\n  being driven by Scott and Williams on the night in question, the two shell\r\n  casings were conclusively determined to have been fired from the weapon carried\r\n  by Scott that evening, and Victim suffered two gunshot wounds that night; and\r\n  (7) when Scott and Williams returned to Rudy's house and the discussion arose\r\n  regarding Victim having been injured, Williams expressed disdain for Victim. \r\n  Although Scott and Williams were not placed at Victims home at the exact time\r\n  of the shooting, they were placed near scene of the crime within the condensed\r\n  time frame that Victim was shot, and that, along with the other evidence\r\n  concerning Williams' and Scott's actions and words that night and the ballistic\r\n  evidence, raised more than a mere suspicion of Scott's guilt and was sufficient\r\n  to submit the matter to the jury.\r\nDue\r\n  to the lack of specificity as to the charge Scott sought on criminal intent at\r\n  his trial, as well as his failure to specify in his brief the exact deficiency\r\n  in the trial court's charge as to &quot;criminal intent&quot; law, we find no\r\n  prejudicial error in the trial court's failure to charge the same.  See Kline\r\n    Iron &amp; Steel Co. v. Superior Trucking Co. 261 S.C. 542, 549-50, 201\r\n  S.E.2d 388, 391-92 (1973) (holding, where appellant challenged the trial\r\n  court's failure to instruct the jury as to principles governing liability for special\r\n  damages, &quot;assuming that there was a request for an instruction as to\r\n  special damages, the contents thereof [were] not included in the record and the\r\n  court, therefore, [could not] review the request to determine whether the lower\r\n  court erred in refusing it&quot;); Wren v. Kirkland Distrib. Co., 250\r\n  S.C. 178, 181-82, 156 S.E.2d 865, 866 (1967) (noting an appellate court will\r\n  not review a trial court's failure to give a requested charge where the\r\n  contents of the charge do not appear in the record); see also Robinson\r\n    v. Estate of Harris, 391 S.C. 114, 130, 705 S.E.2d 41, 49 (2011) (noting &quot;an\r\n  appellate court should not be forced to 'grope in the dark' to ascertain the\r\n  precise nature of an issue on appeal&quot;); Jones v. Lott, 387 S.C.\r\n  339, 348, 692 S.E.2d 900, 904 (2010) (holding an issue raised by Petitioner which\r\n  was not concise and direct, but rather was a broad general statement, ought to\r\n  be disregarded by the appellate court).  Scott only cites to general law\r\n  regarding &quot;criminal intent&quot; in his brief, but fails to discuss how\r\n  any of this law is applicable to, and was required by, the facts of his case. \r\n  Scott does not argue how he was prejudiced by the failure of the trial court to\r\n  give a general &quot;criminal intent&quot; charge.  Further, he does not argue\r\n  how the charge, as given, failed to cover the law on criminal intent.  Thus, we\r\n  hold Scott failed to show both error and prejudice, as Scott has failed to\r\n  establish that he was prejudiced by the failure of the trial court to give any\r\n  particular jury instruction on &quot;criminal intent.&quot;  See State\r\n    v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 261, 565 S.E.2d 298, 303 (2002) (holding it is\r\n  the substance of the law that must be charged to the jury and, to warrant\r\n  reversal, a trial judge's refusal to give a requested jury charge must be both\r\n  erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant).\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, Scott's conviction is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, PIEPER and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-044","title":"Veronie v. 303 Associates","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayUnPubOpinion.cfm?caseNo=2012-UP-044","description":null,"date":"2012-01-25","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n\t\t<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nP.heading {\r\ntext-align:center\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS\r\n  OPINION HAS NO PRECEDENTIAL VALUE.&nbsp; IT SHOULD NOT BE CITED OR RELIED ON AS\r\n  PRECEDENT IN ANY PROCEEDING EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY RULE 268(d)(2), SCACR.\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        J.N.

Tupper of Beaufort, for\r\n          Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  J.N. and Laura K. Veronie (the Veronies)\r\n  brought this action against 303 Associates, LLC (303) for breach of contract and\r\n  Lowcountry Real Estate (Lowcountry) for breach of contract, fraud, negligent misrepresentation,\r\n  and negligence.  On appeal, the Veronies argue the circuit court erred in\r\n  granting summary judgment to 303 before the completion of discovery. \r\n  Additionally, the Veronies contend the circuit court erred in granting\r\n  Lowcountry's Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, motion to dismiss.  We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\n1. We hold\r\n  the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment before the Veronies had a\r\n  full and fair opportunity to complete discovery.   Here, the deposition of Susan\r\n  Markham, who represented to the Veronies that the contract in question had been\r\n  signed by 303, was scheduled to occur two weeks following the summary judgment hearing. \r\n  Additionally, at the time of the hearing, Lowcountry had not responded to the\r\n  Veronies' discovery request to produce the contract.  Therefore, the circuit\r\n  court's grant of summary judgment two and one-half months after the Veronies\r\n  filed their complaint was premature.  See Doe v. Batson, 345 S.C.\r\n  316, 321, 548 S.E.2d 854, 857 (2001) (internal citation omitted) (&quot;Summary\r\n  judgment is a drastic remedy, which should be cautiously invoked so that no\r\n  person will be improperly deprived of a trial of the disputed factual\r\n  issues.&quot;); Baughman v.

We hold\r\n  the circuit court erred in dismissing the Veronies' complaint on the ground\r\n  that it failed to allege the existence of a valid contract.  Viewing the\r\n  factual allegations in the complaint, and inferences from them, in the light\r\n  most favorable to the Veronies, we find they pled sufficient facts which could\r\n  entitle them to relief.

Rosenfeld, of Greenville, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  Appellant George Zokoff appeals from an order of the\r\n  family court denying his request for a modification of child support.  On\r\n  appeal, Zokoff argues the family court erred by refusing to reduce the amount\r\n  of child support he was obligated to pay Respondent Marisa Lozada and by\r\n  refusing to recalculate his income for child support purposes pursuant to the\r\n  child support guidelines.  We affirm.\r\n1.  We find the\r\n  family court did not err by refusing to reduce the amount of child support\r\n  Zokoff was obligated to pay because Zokoff had the means from which he could\r\n  continue to satisfy his child support obligation despite his unemployment.  See Miles v. Miles, 393 S.C. 111, 120, 711 S.E.2d 880, 885 (2011) (providing\r\n  a family court has the authority to modify the amount of a child support award\r\n  upon a showing of a substantial and unanticipated change in circumstances); Calvert\r\n    v. Calvert, 287 S.C. 130, 138, 336 S.E.2d 884, 888-89 (Ct. App. 1985)\r\n  (holding a reduction in the salary or income of a supporting parent does not\r\n  necessarily justify a reduction in child support); Miller v. Miller, 299\r\n  S.C. 307, 310-11, 384 S.E.2d 715, 717 (1989) (&quot;A downward modification in\r\n  child support based upon a decrease in the noncustodial parent's income is not\r\n  warranted absent a strong showing by the party seeking the change that he is no\r\n  longer in a condition to make the support payments prescribed by an earlier . .\r\n  . order.&quot;); Eagerton v. Eagerton, 265 S.C. 90, 95, 217 S.E.2d 146,\r\n  148 (1975) (holding when there is sufficient property and a means to continue\r\n  making the ordered payments, the supporting parent is called upon to use those assets\r\n  even where his or her income declines).\r\n2.  We find the\r\n  family court did not err by refusing to recalculate Zokoff's income pursuant to\r\n  the child support guidelines because Zokoff failed to show a substantial change\r\n  in circumstances warranting a modification of his child support obligation.  See Bennett v. Rector, 389 S.C. 274, 281, 697 S.E.2d 715, 719 (Ct. App.\r\n  2010) (&quot;Generally, the family court is required to follow the Guidelines\r\n  in determining the amount of child support.&quot;); Tilghman\r\n    v. Tilghman, 315 S.C. 76,\r\n  77, 431 S.E.2d 622, 623 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding child support guidelines\r\n  become applicable only upon a showing of substantial change of circumstances justifying\r\n  a modification of child support);  Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown,\r\n    Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (recognizing an\r\n  appellate court need not address additional issues if the resolution of another\r\n  issue is dispositive).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, PIEPER,\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-046","title":"State v.

(Mother) appeals the family court's termination of her parental rights (TPR)\r\n  to her three minor children (Children), arguing the family court erred in\r\n  terminating her parental rights when the Department of Social Services (DSS)\r\n  failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it was not reasonably\r\n  likely the home could be made safe within twelve months.  We affirm.[1]\r\nThe family court may order\r\n  TPR upon finding one or more of eleven statutory grounds is satisfied and also\r\n  finding TPR is in the best interest of the child.[2] \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2570 (2010).  Section 63-7-2570(1) of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (Supp. 2010) provides for termination of parental rights when: &quot;The\r\n  child or another child while residing in the parent's domicile has been harmed\r\n  . . . and because of the severity or repetition of the abuse or neglect, it is\r\n  not reasonably likely that the home can be made safe within twelve\r\n  months.&quot;  Furthermore, &quot;[i]n determining the likelihood that the home\r\n  can be made safe, the parent's previous abuse or neglect of the child . . . may\r\n  be considered.&quot;  S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2570(1).  A child is harmed when a\r\n  parent &quot;fails to supply the child with adequate . . . shelter . . . and\r\n  the failure to do so has caused or presents a substantial risk of causing\r\n  physical or mental injury.&quot;  S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-20(4)(c) (2010).  \r\nOn appeal from the family\r\n  court, this court reviews factual and legal issues de novo.&nbsp; Simmons v.\r\n    Simmons, 392 S.C. 412, 414, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011); see also Lewis\r\n      v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 386, 709 S.E.2d 650, 652 (2011).&nbsp; Although\r\n  this court reviews the family court's findings de novo, we are not required to\r\n  ignore the fact that the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in\r\n  a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight\r\n  to their testimony.&nbsp; Lewis, 392 S.C. at 385, 709 S.E.2d at\r\n  652.&nbsp; The burden is upon the appellant to convince this court that the\r\n  family court erred in its findings.&nbsp; Id.\r\nWe affirm the family court's\r\n  finding that the Children were harmed because Mother failed to provide an\r\n  adequate, safe, and sanitary home.  Significant evidence was presented that the\r\n  home was found in a deplorable condition multiple times over the course of\r\n  almost five years.  The record reveals authorities observed dirty clothes and\r\n  trash strewn around the home, piles of dirty diapers, rotten food, and\r\n  roaches.  Furthermore, testimony was presented that batteries, cords, and other\r\n  safety hazards were on the floor and posed a potential danger to the Children. \r\n  In regards to whether it is reasonably likely that the home could be made safe\r\n  within twelve months, it is particularly telling that Mother received extensive\r\n  services from DSS, admitted to being able to keep a clean home, yet still\r\n  repeatedly failed to keep the home in a safe and sanitary condition.  Mother's\r\n  extended involvement with DSS over the same issue demonstrates a pattern of\r\n  neglect that indicates the home is not reasonably likely to be made safe within\r\n  twelve months.  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Mother did not appeal the family court's finding that\r\n  TPR was in Children's best interests.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-052","title":"SCDSS v.

McDow and Erin K. Urquhart, both of Rock Hill, for\r\n          Appellant.\r\n        Adrienne Woods, of Rock Hill, for Respondent.\r\n        Rosalee Hix Davis, of Lancaster, for\r\n          Guardian ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: James\r\n  G. (Stepfather) appeals the family court's order finding he abused his wife's\r\n  (Mother) minor child (Child), ordering that his name be placed on the Central\r\n  Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect, and ordering him to pay child support. \r\n  Stepfather argues the family court erred in (1) finding he abused Child, (2)\r\n  ordering that his name be placed on the Central Registry of Child Abuse and\r\n  Neglect, (3) ordering him to pay child support for Child, (4) relying on the\r\n  Guardian ad Litem's (GAL) report when the GAL did not appear at trial or sign\r\n  the report, and (5) issuing an order that failed to comply with the\r\n  requirements of Rule 26(a), SCRFC.  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and\r\n  remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n1. As to whether the family\r\n  court erred in finding Stepfather abused Child, we affirm.  \r\n&quot;In appeals from the\r\n  family court, the appellate court has the authority to find the facts in\r\n  accordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence.&quot;&nbsp; Ex\r\n    parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 61, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652 (2006).&nbsp; &quot;This\r\n  broad scope of review does not, however, require the appellate court to\r\n  disregard the findings of the family court.&quot;&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\n  &quot;This degree of deference is especially true in cases involving the\r\n  welfare and best interests of a minor child.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 62, 624\r\n  S.E.2d at 652.\r\nSection 63-7-20(4)(a) of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (2010) defines child abuse as occurring  \r\n\r\n  when\r\n    the parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the child's welfare . . .\r\n    inflicts or allows to be inflicted upon the child physical or mental injury or\r\n    engages in acts or omissions which present a substantial risk of physical or\r\n    mental injury to the child, including injuries sustained as a result of\r\n    excessive corporal punishment . . . .  \r\n\r\nIn the instant case, Child stated Stepfather hit him in the chest, slapped\r\n  him in the face and head, and verbally abused him.  Child claimed\r\n  Stepfather hit him hard enough in the chest for him &quot;to feel it for a few\r\n  minutes&quot; and that Stepfather hit him hard enough to leave bruises.  In\r\n  addition, Child claimed Stepfather challenged him to a fight on numerous\r\n  occasions.  Further, although he disputed the severity of Child's\r\n  injuries, Stepfather admitted hitting Child in the chest and head, and Mother\r\n  also testified that Stepfather had hit Child.  Finally, the DSS caseworker and Child's\r\n  biological father testified Child had told them Stepfather was abusive.  Based\r\n  on the foregoing evidence, the family court did not err in determining\r\n  Stepfather's actions constituted abuse.  Accordingly, we affirm the family\r\n  court's finding that Stepfather abused Child.  \r\n2. As to whether the\r\n  family court erred in ordering that Stepfather's name be placed on the Central\r\n  Registry for Child Abuse and Neglect, we affirm.\r\nSection 63-7-1940 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (2010) details the means by which a person is entered in\r\n  the Central Registry and provides as follows:\r\n\r\n  At a\r\n    hearing pursuant to Section 63-7-1650 or 63-7-1660, at which the court orders\r\n    that a child be taken or retained in custody or finds that the child was abused\r\n    or neglected, the court:\r\n  (1)\r\n    must order that a person's name be entered in the Central Registry of Child\r\n    Abuse and Neglect if the court finds that there is a preponderance of evidence\r\n    that the person physically or sexually abused or willfully or recklessly\r\n    neglected the child.  Placement on the Central Registry cannot be waived by any\r\n    party or by the court.  \r\n\r\nBecause we find the family\r\n  court did not err in finding Stepfather physically abused Child, we also find\r\n  the family court did not err pursuant to section 63-7-1940 in ordering that\r\n  Stepfather's name be placed on the Central Registry for Child Abuse and\r\n  Neglect.  \r\n3. As to\r\n  whether the family court erred in ordering Stepfather to pay child support for\r\n  Child, we reverse.  Stepfather is not\r\n  Child's adoptive or biological father.  No South Carolina statutes or cases\r\n  impose the obligation on third parties to pay child support.  Accordingly, we reverse\r\n  the family court's order to the extent it imposes an obligation on Stepfather\r\n  to pay child support and remand for a recalculation of child support based\r\n  solely on Mother's obligation.  \r\n4. As to whether the\r\n  family court erred in relying on the GAL's report when the GAL did not sign the\r\n  report or appear at the hearing, we affirm.  Stepfather's arguments are not\r\n  preserved for appeal.  Stepfather did not object to the introduction of the\r\n  GAL's report during the hearing.  See Spreeuw v. Barker, 385 S.C.\r\n  45, 70-71, 682 S.E.2d 843, 856 (Ct. App. 2009) (finding a father's challenges\r\n  to the GAL's report unpreserved when the father failed to object to the report\r\n  and noting that a contemporaneous objection is required to preserve issues for\r\n  appellate review).       \r\n5. As to\r\n  whether the family court's order violated Rule 26(a), SCRFC, we affirm.  Rule\r\n  26(a), SCRFC, states that &quot;[a]n order or judgment pursuant to an\r\n  adjudication in a domestic relations case shall set forth the specific findings\r\n  of fact and conclusions of law to support the court's decision.&quot;  Because\r\n  the family court's order in the instant case made specific findings of fact\r\n  regarding the pertinent issues involved, we find the family court's order in\r\n  the instant case sufficiently complied with the requirements of Rule 26(a).   \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART,\r\n  REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nFEW, C.J., and\r\n  THOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-053","title":"SCDSS v.
