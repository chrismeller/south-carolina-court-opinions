Coombs, Jr., Office of the Attorney\r\n          General, of Columbia for Respondent; and Solicitor Douglas A. Barfield, Jr., of\r\n          Lancaster, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Laurtrent M. Montgomery appeals his\r\n  conviction for second-degree burglary, arguing the trial court erred in failing\r\n  to dismiss the charge on double jeopardy grounds.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nMontgomery was accused of breaking and entering into a home and\r\n  an adjacent shed located nearby on the same property.Â  He was charged with\r\n  first-degree burglary for entering the house and second-degree burglary for\r\n  entering the shed.Â  At trial, Montgomery moved to have the second-degree\r\n  burglary charge dismissed arguing the double jeopardy clause prevented him from\r\n  receiving multiple punishments for the same offense.Â  Montgomery contended that\r\n  under section 16-11-10 of the South Carolina Code (2003), the house and the\r\n  shed constituted â€œone parcel.â€Â  Therefore, he argued he should only be charged\r\n  with the single charge of first-degree burglary.Â  The trial court denied the\r\n  motion.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMontgomery argues that under section 16-11-10 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (2003), the house and the shed constituted â€œone parcel.â€Â \r\n  Therefore, the act of breaking into the house and the shed constituted one\r\n  offense.Â  Under the theory of double jeopardy, he could not be given multiple\r\n  punishments for one offense.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nSection\r\n  16-11-10 provides:\r\n\r\n  With\r\n    respect to the crimes of burglary and arson and to all criminal offenses which\r\n    are constituted or aggravated by being committed in a dwelling house, any\r\n    house, outhouse, apartment, building, erection, shed or box in which there\r\n    sleeps a proprietor, tenant, watchman, clerk, laborer or person who lodges there\r\n    with a view to the protection of property shall be deemed a dwelling house, and\r\n    of such a dwelling house or of any other dwelling house all houses, outhouses,\r\n    buildings, sheds and erections which are within two hundred yards of it and are\r\n    appurtenant to it or to the same establishment of which it is an appurtenance\r\n    shall be deemed parcels.\r\n\r\nTo\r\n  adopt Montgomeryâ€™s interpretation of the statute strains the bounds of\r\n  reasonableness.Â  The statute does not indicate that a dwelling house and a shed\r\n  or other appurtenance constitute one unit with regard to the crime of\r\n  burglary.Â  The statue merely indicates that such appurtenances are considered\r\n  dwellings in the same manner that a house is considered a dwelling.Â  Therefore,\r\n  if a defendant is accused of breaking into such a structure, he can be charged\r\n  with breaking into a dwelling.\r\nState\r\n  v. Evans, 18 S.C. 137 (1882),\r\n  discussed the former version of this statute which made appurtenant structures â€œdwellings.â€Â \r\n  The supreme court stated that the â€œstatute was intended to enlarge the field\r\n  within which burglary could be committed.â€Â  Id.Â  That seems to be the\r\n  consistent purpose of treating sheds, garages, porches and other appurtenant\r\n  structures as dwellings.Â  There is no indication in the current statute to\r\n  suggest the legislature meant to somehow contract the field within which\r\n  burglary may be committed by making nearby structures and homes one indivisible\r\n  unit.\r\nÂ Â \r\n  Furthermore, section 16-11-310 of the South Carolina Code (2003) states that\r\n  â€œ[w]here a building consists of two or more units separately occupied or\r\n  secured, each unit is deemed both a separate building in itself and a part of\r\n  the main building.â€Â  Under this statute, a single building can be the site of\r\n  multiple burglaries provided there are separately secured units within the\r\n  building.Â  If that is the case, it would be illogical to assume section\r\n  16-11-10 intended to make two free-standing, separately-secured structures a\r\n  single building for purposes of the burglary statute.\r\nBased\r\n  on all of the foregoing, the ruling of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nAnderson, Williams,\r\n  and Konduros, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This case was decided without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-603","title":"South Carolina Department of Social Services v.

Hudgins, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â This case involves the interpretation of\r\n  the Sex Offender Accountability and Protection of Minors Act (the Act).Â  The\r\n  State appeals the probation judgeâ€™s imposition of global positioning satellite\r\n  monitoring (GPS) on Jenny Davis for the duration of her probation.Â  We reverse. [1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  December 2, 2004, Davis pleaded guilty to lewd act upon a child under sixteen. Â The\r\n  trial court sentenced Davis to six yearsâ€™ imprisonment suspended upon the\r\n  service of time served and three yearsâ€™ probation.Â  \r\nDavis subsequently\r\n  committed a series of probation violations. Â After a probation violation\r\n  hearing, the probation judge revoked three months of Davisâ€™s suspended\r\n  sentence, continued her probation, and placed her on GPS monitoring\r\n  during the term of her probation. Â The State responded that because Davis pled guilty to lewd act on a child under sixteen, the Act requires monitoring for\r\n  the duration Davis is required to remain on the sex offender registry.Â  The\r\n  probation judge expressed concerns with lifetime GPS monitoring and ordered the\r\n  monitoring only during the term of Davisâ€™s probation.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nThe State argues the probation judge erred in imposing GPS\r\n  monitoring on Davis for a period of time less than the duration Davis is required to remain on the sex offender registry.Â  We agree.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSection\r\n  23-3-540(C) of the Act provides: â€œA person who is required to register pursuant\r\n  to this article for . . . committing or attempting a lewd act upon a child\r\n  under sixteen, pursuant to Section 16-15-140, and who violates a term of\r\n  probation . . . must be ordered by the court or agency with jurisdiction to be\r\n  monitored . . . with an active electronic monitoring device.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  23-3-540(C) (Supp. 2007).Â  â€œThe person shall be monitored . . . for the\r\n  duration of the time the person is required to remain on the sex offender\r\n  registry.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-540(H) (Supp. 2007)\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  \r\nâ€œWhen\r\n  a statuteâ€™s terms are clear and unambiguous on their face, there is no room for\r\n  statutory construction and a court must apply the statute according to its\r\n  literal meaning.â€Â  Miller v. Aiken, 364 S.C. 303, 307, 613 S.E.2d\r\n  364, 366 (2005).Â  The word â€œshallâ€ indicates the time period set forth in Â§\r\n  23-3-540(H) is mandatory.Â  See State v. Foster,&nbsp;277 S.C.\r\n  211, 212, 284 S.E.2d 780, 780&nbsp;(1981) (â€œTaken literally, the word â€˜shallâ€™\r\n  is mandatory.â€).Â  Accordingly, the probation judge lacked discretion to shorten\r\n  the duration of Davisâ€™s electronic monitoring.[2]Â  \r\nREVERSED. \r\nHEARN,\r\nC.J., SHORT and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\nRule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  We note Â§ 23-3-540(H) permits a person to petition\r\n  for release from the monitoring requirements ten years from the date electronic\r\nmonitoring is imposed.Â  S.C.

Wilson and Michael A. Farry, both of Greenville, for\r\n          Appellants.\r\n        KathrynÂ  Williams, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Teresa Hampton brought this workersâ€™ compensation case\r\n  seeking benefits for an injury resulting from a fall at work.Â  The Appellate\r\n  Panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (Appellate Panel) denied\r\n  compensation.Â  The circuit court reversed.Â  Hamptonâ€™s employer, Hunt Assisted\r\n  Living d/b/a Greenville Place Assisted Living (Hunt), and Huntâ€™s carrier, Key\r\n  Risk Insurance Company (collectively Appellants), appeal.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS / PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nHampton began working for Hunt in June 2004 as a certified nursing assistant. Â She subsequently\r\n  took a position in the kitchen as a cook. Â On October 25, 2004, after sitting\r\n  at a table looking through menus, Hampton stood up and took a step with her\r\n  right foot. Â When she began to take a step with her left foot, her ankle\r\n  â€œtwistedâ€ or â€œcurled overâ€ causing her to fall to the floor. Â Hampton continued to work for an hour, but then went to the hospital because of severe\r\n  pain in her left leg. Â Hampton was diagnosed at the hospital with left ankle\r\n  sprain.Â  Dr. George Pattis examined Hampton about a week after her fall.Â  Dr.\r\n  Pattis opined Hampton suffered from left ankle sprain and left foot\r\n  tendonitis.Â  Dr. Pattis also noted Hampton suffered from right ankle ligaments\r\n  strain from overuse of the right leg.Â  Hampton returned to work in November\r\n  2004.Â  Later that month, Hunt terminated Hamptonâ€™s employment for\r\n  insubordination.\r\nHampton subsequently brought this workersâ€™ compensation action seeking temporary total\r\n  disability benefits and payment of past and continuing medical care. Â The\r\n  single commissioner denied Hamptonâ€™s claim, holding Hamptonâ€™s injuries were not\r\n  connected to or caused by her employment with Hunt. Â The Appellate Panel\r\n  affirmed and adopted the order of the single commission in its entirety. Â Hampton then appealed to the circuit court. Â The circuit court reversed, holding Hampton\r\n  sustained a compensable injury by accident as defined in the Workersâ€™\r\n  Compensation Act and remanding the claim to the Workersâ€™ Compensation\r\n  Commission (the Commission) to determine the extent of medical and compensation\r\n  benefits.Â  \r\nThis appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants\r\n  argue the circuit court erred in holding Hampton sustained a compensable injury\r\n  by accident as defined in the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act (the Act).Â  Specifically,\r\n  Appellants contend Hamptonâ€™s injuries are not compensable because Hampton failed to show a causal connection between her fall and her employment.Â \r\n  Appellants assert Hamptonâ€™s injuries resulted from an idiopathic or unexplained\r\n  fall.Â  We agree.\r\nIn\r\n  reviewing workersâ€™ compensation decisions, the appellate court ascertains\r\n  â€œwhether the circuit court properly determined whether the appellate panelâ€™s\r\n  findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence in the record and\r\n  whether the panelâ€™s decision is affected by an error of law.â€ &nbsp;Baxter\r\n    v. Martin Bros., Inc., 368 S.C. 510, 513, 630 S.E.2d 42, 43&nbsp;(2006)\r\n  (citations omitted); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (Supp.\r\n  2007).&nbsp; â€œâ€˜Substantial evidenceâ€™ is evidence which, considering the entire\r\n  record, would allow reasonable minds to arrive at the same conclusion reached\r\n  by the administrative agency.â€&nbsp; S.C. Second Injury Fund v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 353 S.C. 117, 122, 576 S.E.2d 199, 202 (Ct. App. 2003).&nbsp;\r\n  The Administrative Procedures Act does not permit an appellate court to â€œsubstitute\r\n  its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on\r\n  questions of fact.â€&nbsp; West v. Alliance Capital, 368 S.C. 246, 251,\r\n  628 S.E.2d 279, 282 (Ct. App. 2006).&nbsp;\r\nAn\r\n  injury is compensable under the Act if it occurs accidentally, â€œarising out of\r\n  and in the course of employment.â€&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160(A) (Supp.\r\n  2007).Â  â€œAn injury arises out of employment when there is apparent to the\r\n  rational mind, upon consideration of all the circumstances, a causal\r\n  relationship between the conditions under which the work is to be performed and\r\n  the resulting injury.â€Â  Owings v. Anderson County Sheriffâ€™s Dept., 315\r\n  S.C. 297, 299, 433 S.E.2d 869, 871 (1993).Â  Further, â€œif the injury can be seen\r\n  to have followed as a natural incident of the work and as a result of the\r\n  exposure occasioned by the nature of the employment, then it arises out of the\r\n  employment.â€Â  Holley v. Owens Corning Fiberglas Corp., 301 S.C. 519,\r\n  523, 392 S.E.2d 804, 807 (Ct. App. 1990).\r\nSpecific rules\r\n  relating to idiopathic or unexplained falls, however, modify the general ruling\r\n  of compensability.Â  An unexplained fall is generally not compensable unless the\r\n  employment contributed to either the cause or the effect of the fall.&nbsp; Bagwell\r\n    v. Ernest Burwell, Inc., 227 S.C. 444, 452-53, 88 S.E.2d 611, 614-15 (1955).&nbsp;\r\n  The causative danger â€œneed not have been foreseen or expected, but after the\r\n  event it must appear to have had its origin in a risk connected with the\r\n  employment, and to have flowed from that source as a rational consequence.â€Â  West\r\n    v. Alliance Capital, 368 S.C. 246, 252, 628 S.E.2d 279, 282 (Ct. App. 2006)\r\n  (internal citations omitted).&nbsp; Injuries are excluded from compensability\r\n  under the Act when they come â€œfrom a hazard to which the workmen would have\r\n  been equally exposed apart from the employment.â€&nbsp; Crosby v.\r\n    Wal-Mart Store, Inc., 330 S.C. 489, 493, 499 S.E.2d 253, 255 (Ct. App.\r\n  1998).&nbsp; â€œThe burden is on the claimant to prove such facts as will render\r\n  the injury compensable, and such an award must not be based on surmise, conjecture\r\n  or speculation.â€ Id. at 496, 499 S.E.2d at 257.\r\nThe\r\n  facts in this case are very similar to the facts set forth in Crosby,\r\n  330 S.C. 489, 499 S.E.2d 253.Â  In Crosby, the claimant, a Wal-Mart\r\n  employee, sought benefits for injuries she received when she fell at work.Â  The\r\n  claimant testified she fell while walking through the store on the way to a\r\n  meeting. Id. at 491, 499 S.E.2d at 254.Â  She stated, â€œI was just walking\r\n  on the floor and my feet went from under me.â€Â  Id.Â  This court\r\n  determined the claimantâ€™s fall was an unexplained fall.Â  We stated, â€œ[T]here\r\n  was no evidence offered in the case at hand as to what caused [the claimant] to\r\n  fall.Â  It would be wholly conjectural to say under the evidence presented that\r\n  [the claimantâ€™s] employment was a contributing cause of her injury.â€Â  Id. at 495, 499 S.E.2d at 256.Â  This court further reasoned that, while the fall was\r\n  unexplained, there was an apparent lack of work connection and an implication\r\n  of a pre-existing physical condition.Â  Id. at 496, 499 S.E.2d at 257.\r\n  This court concluded there was substantial evidence to support the Appellate\r\n  Panelâ€™s finding that claimant failed to show a causal connection between her\r\n  fall and her employment.Â  Id.\r\nHere,\r\n  Hampton fell when she stood up from a table and began to walk.Â  Like the\r\n  claimant in Crosby, Hampton could not explain the reason for her fall.Â  Hampton testified her ankle simply â€œtwistedâ€\r\n  or â€œcurled over.â€Â  Although Hampton was involved in work duties when she fell,\r\n  no evidence indicates her employment contributed to the cause or the effect of\r\n  her fall.Â  As set forth above, the burden is on Hampton to establish facts\r\n  showing her injury is compensable.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court\r\n  and find substantial evidence supports the Appellate Panelâ€™s finding Hamptonâ€™s injuries were not connected to or caused by her employment.\r\nREVERSED.Â  \r\nHUFF and\r\n  GEATHERS, JJ., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-631","title":"Tippett v.

Metts a\r\n  four-percent special property tax assessment ratio.Â  Metts received the\r\n  four-percent assessment ratio until 2006.Â  In 2005, the Legislature amended the\r\n  tax assessment ratio statute to guarantee a four-percent assessment ratio for\r\n  properties that otherwise qualified but were rented out for less than fifteen\r\n  days during the tax year.Â  Because Metts rented her home out for 85 days in\r\n  2006, the Assessor prepared her tax bill for that year using the higher\r\n  six-percent assessment ratio.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  affirm[1] pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities.Â  As to the\r\n  question whether the ALC erred in its judgment:Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610\r\n  (Supp. 2007) (â€œThe review of the administrative law judgeâ€™s order must be\r\n  confined to the recordâ€; appellate court may reverse the ALC if the ALCâ€™s\r\n  decision is â€œaffected by [an] error of law.â€); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-43-220(c)(1)\r\n  (Supp. 2007) (â€œThe legal residence . . . [is] taxed on an assessment equal to\r\n  four percent of the fair market value of the property.â€); S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§&nbsp;12-43-220(c)(2)(i) (Supp. 2007) (finding four percent assessment ratio\r\n  applies when â€œthe owner-occupant [has] owned and occupied the residence as his\r\n  legal residence and [has] been domiciled at that address for some period during\r\n  the applicable tax yearâ€); S.C. Code Ann. Â§&nbsp;12-43-220(c)(7) (Supp. 2007)\r\n  (renting out a residential property for fewer than fifteen days during the tax\r\n  year does not preclude that property from receiving the four percent assessment\r\n  ratio); and Russo v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 334 S.C. 455, 458, 513\r\n  S.E.2d 127, 128 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œIn statutory construction, legislative intent\r\n  prevails where it can be reasonably ascertained from the plain meaning of the statutory language.â€).Â  As to the question\r\n  whether the ALC properly applied rules of statutory construction:Â  Aiken v.\r\n    World Fin. Corp., 373 S.C. 144, 644 S.E.2d 705 (2007) (finding issues not\r\n  raised and ruled upon in the trial court will not be considered on appeal).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF,\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-641","title":"State v.

Â Wife was thirty-one, had a high-school\r\n  education, and worked for $6.00 per hour before the marriage.Â  Wife never held\r\n  a full-time job during the marriage; however, she worked part-time in various\r\n  capacities, including one year as a substitute teacher and several years as a\r\n  temporary organist at the partiesâ€™ church.Â  She also occasionally â€œfilled inâ€\r\n  when one of Husbandâ€™s front office staff members was unavailable, but never\r\n  accepted regular employment with Husbandâ€™s dental practice despite having been\r\n  offered full-time work there.\r\nThe\r\n  parties had one child together in 1990, and Husband adopted Wifeâ€™s children\r\n  from two of her prior marriages.Â  At the time of the litigation, the two\r\n  adopted children had attained their majority.\r\nPrior\r\n  to the marriage, Husband purchased the home in which the parties were to reside\r\n  for the duration of their marriage.Â  The purchase price for the home and\r\n  surrounding acreage totaled $157,600.00.Â  When he purchased the home, Husband\r\n  paid $27,000.00 down and placed a mortgage for the balance on the property.Â \r\n  The mortgage was refinanced in 1994.Â  Marital funds, consisting primarily if\r\n  not entirely of Husbandâ€™s earnings during the marriage, were used to pay the\r\n  indebtedness on the home.Â  In addition, there were several upgrades done to the\r\n  home to make it more family-friendly.\r\nAccording\r\n  to Husband, the partiesâ€™ relationship began to decline around 1994, about ten\r\n  years before the partiesâ€™ breakup.Â  Husband contended the tension in the\r\n  marriage resulted from (1) Wifeâ€™s spending habits and refusal to manage her\r\n  debt responsibly; (2) Husbandâ€™s anxiety disorder, which he claimed came about\r\n  as a result of overloading himself with financial and physical demands, his\r\n  motherâ€™s death, and Wifeâ€™s refusal to help deal with his stress; (3) Wifeâ€™s\r\n  decreasing sexual interest; and (4) disagreements between the parties\r\n  concerning financial matters.\r\nOn\r\n  July 23, 2004, Wife commenced this action, seeking joint custody of the\r\n  partiesâ€™ minor child, child support, alimony, equitable division of the marital\r\n  property, attorneyâ€™s fees, and other relief.Â  On September 10, 2004, Husband\r\n  answered and counterclaimed.Â  In his responsive pleadings, Husband admitted the\r\n  parties were husband and wife; however, he also raised as a defense and by way\r\n  of a motion to dismiss his allegation that Wifeâ€™s divorce from one of her\r\n  previous husbands was not valid in South Carolina.Â  Based on this defense,\r\n  Husband asserted the partiesâ€™ marriage should be annulled and Wife should therefore\r\n  be barred from receiving alimony.Â  Husband also requested custody of the\r\n  partiesâ€™ child, child support, equitable division of the marital property,\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees, and other relief.\r\nOn September\r\n  22, 2004, the parties appeared before the family court for a temporary\r\n  hearing.Â  By order dated September 29, 2004, the court denied Husbandâ€™s motion\r\n  to dismiss, awarded Husband temporary use of the family home and contents,\r\n  awarded Wife temporary use of the â€œmother-in-law houseâ€ on the property and its\r\n  contents, awarded the parties temporary joint custody with primary custody to Wife\r\n  and Husband paying temporary child support, awarded Wife temporary alimony, and\r\n  granted other relief.Â  On September 8, 2005, pursuant to a motion filed by\r\n  Wife, the family court issued an amended temporary order granting custody of\r\n  the partiesâ€™ child to Wife, with Husband paying child support and receiving\r\n  reasonable visitation.\r\nThe\r\n  matter came to a final hearing on September 13 and 15, 2005.Â  At the call of\r\n  the case, Wife moved to supplement her complaint to seek a divorce on the\r\n  ground of a one-year separation and resumption of her maiden name.Â  Husband did\r\n  not object, and the motion was granted. Â The issue of the divorce was\r\n  bifurcated from the remaining issues in the case, and on October 17, 2005, an\r\n  order was filed granting the divorce.\r\nOn\r\n  January 23, 2007, the family court issued another order addressing the\r\n  remaining issues of alimony and equitable distribution.Â  In the order, the\r\n  court noted the parties had settled the issues of custody, visitation, and\r\n  child support, as well as possession and ownership of certain items.Â  The\r\n  family court went on to find, among other things, (1) there was no marital\r\n  misconduct by either party causing the breakup of the marriage or adversely\r\n  affecting the economic circumstances of the marriage; (2) Wife was not entitled\r\n  to alimony; (3) the home in which the parties resided, though acquired by\r\n  Husband before the marriage, had been transmuted into marital property and was\r\n  subject to equitable division; and (4) neither Husbandâ€™s dental office\r\n  property, which was acquired before the marriage, nor a parking lot acquired\r\n  during the marriage, was marital property. Â Regarding valuation of certain\r\n  assets, the family court adopted the values given by Wifeâ€™s experts, noting\r\n  Husband, instead of offering his own expert witnesses on these matters, merely\r\n  disputed the values attested to by Wifeâ€™s experts.Â  The court then found the\r\n  total value of the marital assets to be $1,434,738.00, which it divided equally\r\n  between the parties.Â  Although the family court declined to award Wife additional\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees beyond what she received at the temporary hearing, Husband was\r\n  required to pay $33,066.25, the entire amount of what Wife claimed in expert\r\n  witness fees, not later than sixty days from the signing of the order.\r\nIn\r\n  order to effectuate the division, the family court found Husband owed Wife\r\n  $476,644.50.Â  Finding Husband would probably would not be able to borrow\r\n  sufficient funds to pay this amount, the court ordered (1) the marital residence\r\n  to be sold; (2) Husband to pay Wife $2,500.00 per month toward her equitable\r\n  division award until the sale of the marital residence; and (3) the balance of\r\n  the equitable distribution award to be paid within ninety days of the sale.\r\nBoth\r\n  parties moved to alter or amend the judgment.Â  Pursuant to these motions, the\r\n  family court issued an amended final order, which was filed May 31, 2007.Â  In\r\n  the order, the court awarded Wife permanent periodic alimony in the amount of\r\n  $2,000.00 per month,[1] but changed the division of the marital estate to award Husband fifty-five\r\n  percent of the marital assets and Wife forty-five percent.Â  The expert witness\r\n  fees assessed against Husband were reduced to $23,066.25 based on a finding\r\n  that the services of one of Wifeâ€™s experts were incurred in connection with\r\n  parcels of property that Wife conceded were not marital.Â  The deadline for\r\n  Husband to pay the balance of Wifeâ€™s share of the equitable distribution was\r\n  changed to â€œsuch time as the marital residence is sold or one year plus forty\r\n  five days, whichever occurs first,â€ with monthly payments of $2,500.00 during\r\n  the interim.Â  Both parties appeal.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nWifeâ€™s Appeal\r\n1.Â  We disagree with Wifeâ€™s\r\n  argument that the family court erred in declining to include Husbandâ€™s dental\r\n  office in the marital estate.Â  There was no dispute that Husband acquired and\r\n  paid for the office before the partiesâ€™ marriage; therefore, Wife, as the party\r\n  claiming transmutation had the burden to produce objective evidence that the\r\n  parties considered the asset to be marital.Â  Deidun v. Deidun, 362 S.C.\r\n  47, 57, 606 S.E.2d 489, 495 (Ct. App. 2004). Â \r\nCiting Trimnal v. Trimnal, 287 S.C. 495, 339 S.E.2d 869 (1986), Wife argues she\r\n  has carried this burden because there was evidence that the office had been\r\n  refinanced during the marriage and the loans incurred in the refinancing had\r\n  been paid off with marital funds, namely, Husbandâ€™s earnings during the\r\n  marriage.Â  Unlike the indebtedness in Trimnal, however, the indebtedness\r\n  on the asset at issue here was incurred for family purposes, and the reason\r\n  business property was used as collateral for the loans was to enable the\r\n  parties to receive an income tax advantage.Â  Under these circumstances, we are\r\n  reluctant to disturb the family courtâ€™s finding that the dental office had not\r\n  been transmuted into marital property; rather, we agree with Husband that the\r\n  financial obligations encumbering this asset amounted to only â€œmere useâ€ of\r\n  separate property to support the marriage.Â  See Johnson v. Johnson,\r\n  296 S.C. 289, 295-96, 372 S.E.2d 107, 111 (Ct. App. 1988) (â€œThe mere use of\r\n  separate property to support the marriage, without some additional evidence of\r\n  intent to treat it as property of the marriage, is not sufficient to establish\r\n  transmutation.â€).Â  Although marital funds were used to discharge these\r\n  obligations, the specific facts of this case do not support a finding that such\r\n  funds were used to â€œbuild equityâ€ in the property.Â  Id.Â  Rather, they were\r\n  used to pay down loans that provided beneficial tax consequences that would not\r\n  have been available but for Husbandâ€™s decision to use his separate property as\r\n  security.\r\n2.Â  We agree, however, with\r\n  Wifeâ€™s argument that the family court should have included the dental office\r\n  parking lot in the marital estate.Â  Unlike the dental office, the adjoining\r\n  parking lot was acquired during the marriage with marital funds and is\r\n  therefore presumptively marital property.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473\r\n  (Supp. 2007) (defining â€œmarital propertyâ€ as â€œall real and personal property\r\n  which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned\r\n  as of the date of the filing or commencement of marital litigation . . .\r\n  regardless of how legal title is heldâ€).Â  Indeed, Husband asserts in his\r\n  respondentâ€™s brief that, although the parking lot is arguably marital, it is\r\n  possible the court felt â€œthat the Wife had not earned an entitlement to a share\r\n  of this particular property.â€Â  This argument, however, apparently ignores the\r\n  principle that Wife did not need to â€œearn an entitlementâ€ to property that is\r\n  prima facie marital in nature.Â  We therefore remand this issue to the family\r\n  court with instructions that the parking lot be included in the marital estate\r\n  and allocated to Husband.\r\n3.Â  Wife also contends the\r\n  family court erred in admitting over her objection two depositions in which the\r\n  deponents, neither of whom appeared at trial, purportedly gave information to\r\n  support Husbandâ€™s claim that Wife was not entitled to alimony because she had\r\n  committed adultery.Â  Wife objected to the admission of the depositions on the\r\n  ground that Husbandâ€™s attorney, in merely informing the court that he was\r\n  unable to locate the deponents to serve them with subpoenas, did not make an\r\n  adequate showing that the witnesses were unavailable.Â  We agree. \r\nAlthough\r\n  Husband is correct that Rule 25 of the South Carolina Family Court Rules allows\r\n  for a more relaxed approach to discovery, the focus of that rule is on â€œthe\r\n  prompt voluntary exchange of information and documents by parties prior to\r\n  trial.â€Â  As to the present dispute, which concerns the trial itself, we agree\r\n  with Wife that the bare assertion by counsel that a witness is unavailable is\r\n  not a sufficient showing to admit that witnessâ€™s deposition.Â  See Archie\r\n    Bell Constr. Co. v. Norman, 311 S.C. 84, 86, 427 S.E.2d 689, 691 (Ct. App. 1993) (finding no reversible error in the trial judgeâ€™s refusal to admit a\r\n  deposition in the deponentâ€™s absence and noting the party proffering the\r\n  deposition â€œmade no showing, by affidavit, sworn testimony, or other evidence, as\r\n    they were required to in absence of a stipulationâ€) (emphasis added).[2]\r\n4.Â  Wife argues the family\r\n  court erred in refusing to award her additional attorneyâ€™s fees at the final\r\n  hearing, specifically in that the court failed to address the four factors set\r\n  forth in E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816\r\n  (1992), namely, (1) the partiesâ€™ ability to pay their own fees, (2) the\r\n  beneficial results obtained by counsel, (3) the financial conditions of the\r\n  parties, and (4) the effect of the fee on each partiesâ€™ standard of living.Â  We\r\n  find no error.Â  \r\nWife contends she\r\n  incurred a total of $53,247.50 in attorneyâ€™s fees, of which the family court\r\n  had already awarded her $15,000.00 at the temporary hearing; thus, a balance of\r\n  $38,247.50 remained.Â  As acknowledged in Wifeâ€™s appellantâ€™s brief, the family\r\n  court ordered Husband to pay her $133,109.00, representing one half of the\r\n  liquid assets he received in the equitable division, within forty-five days\r\n  from the signing of the divorce decree.Â  Although a significant portion of this\r\n  amount was to be paid by way of a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, it\r\n  appears undisputed that Wife would receive within the forty-five day time limit\r\n  an amount in excess of the balance owing in legal fees.Â  Considering that\r\n  Husband was also required to pay monthly installments on the equitable division\r\n  award, alimony, and child support totaling $6,684.00, there seems to be no\r\n  basis for Wifeâ€™s assertion that â€œ[s]he clearly had no means of paying the\r\n  balance of her attorneyâ€™s fees.â€Â  Finally, insofar as the record indicates that\r\n  considerable pretrial time was spent in fruitless pursuits of concealed assets,\r\n  investment losses, and property that Wife later conceded was nonmarital, we\r\n  disagree with Wifeâ€™s contention that the family court failed to give due\r\n  consideration to the beneficial results obtained by her attorney.Â  In our view,\r\n  the family court acted within its discretion in refusing to award additional\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees at the final hearing.Â  See Upchurch v. Upchurch,\r\n  367 S.C. 16, 28, 624 S.E.2d 643, 648 (2006) (stating that in a family court\r\n  matter, â€œ[t]he award of attorneyâ€™s fees is left to the discretion of the trial\r\n  judge and will only be disturbed upon a showing of abuse of discretionâ€).Â  \r\nHusbandâ€™s Appeal\r\n5.Â  Husband first\r\n  contends the family court erred in denying his motion to dismiss Wifeâ€™s\r\n  requests for separate support and maintenance and alimony.Â  This motion was\r\n  based on his allegation that the first of Wifeâ€™s three prior divorces was\r\n  invalid.Â  As a corollary to this argument, Husband also maintains Wife is not entitled\r\n  to alimony because there was a legal impediment to the partiesâ€™ marriage.Â  We\r\n  find no reversible error.Â  \r\nWhen\r\n  the matter was called for trial on September 13, 2005, Wife moved to amend her\r\n  pleadings to request a divorce on a one-year separation and Husband did not\r\n  object to the grant of this relief.Â  The issue of the divorce was bifurcated\r\n  from the remaining issues in the case, and on October 17, 2005, the family\r\n  court filed a final decree of divorce that made no mention of Husbandâ€™s request\r\n  for an annulment.Â  Husband did not timely move to alter or amend this order;\r\n  therefore, we hold the issue of an annulment was not preserved for appeal.Â  See Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124\r\n  (1991) (holding the court of\r\n  appeals improperly addressed an issue that the â€œcircuit court did not\r\n  explicitly rule onâ€ when the appellant did not raise the issue in a motion to\r\n  alter or amend).[3]\r\n6.Â  Husband\r\n  argues the family court erred in finding the family home, which he purchased\r\n  before the partiesâ€™ marriage, had been transmuted into marital property.Â  He\r\n  maintains the factors cited by the court to support its finding are evidence of\r\n  only â€œmere useâ€ of the asset.Â  In the alternative, Husband contends Wife is\r\n  entitled to only a special equity in the property reflecting the reduction in\r\n  the mortgage during the partiesâ€™ marriage and several improvements, including a\r\n  â€œmother-in-lawâ€ cottage, a swimming pool, and certain additions to the home.Â \r\n  We reject these arguments.\r\nThe\r\n  primary question in determining whether an individually owned asset has been\r\n  transmuted into marital property is one of intent, and the party asserting\r\n  transmutation â€œmust produce objective evidence showing that, during the\r\n  marriage, the parties themselves regarded the property as common property of\r\n  the marriage.â€Â  Ray v. Ray, 296 S.C. 350, 352, 372 S.E.2d 910, 911 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  Here, although Wifeâ€™s name was never placed on the title, the home was\r\n  used exclusively for marital purposes, having been purchased by Husband in\r\n  contemplation of the marriage and serving as the marital residence of about\r\n  fifteen years, and marital funds paid for upgrades to the home during the\r\n  partiesâ€™ marriage to make the home more family friendly.Â  We therefore hold the\r\n  evidence supports the family courtâ€™s finding that the family home, though\r\n  acquired by Husband before the marriage, had been transmuted into marital\r\n  property.Â  See Johnson, 296 S.C. at 295-96, 372 S.E.2d at 111\r\n  (including as evidence of transmutation the use of the asset in question exclusively\r\n  for marital purposes and using marital funds to build equity in the property).\r\n7.Â  We agree,\r\n  however, with Husbandâ€™s argument that the family court erred in accepting the conclusion\r\n  of Wifeâ€™s appraiser that the value of the marital home was $800,000.00.Â  \r\nAs the family court correctly noted, Husband himself offered no\r\n  expert testimony on value.Â  Instead, he merely disputed the valuation by Wifeâ€™s\r\n  appraiser and offered his opinion as to what the home was worth.Â  Moreover, we\r\n  recognize the principle that â€œa courtâ€™s valuation of marital property will be\r\n  affirmed if it is within the range of evidence presented.â€Â  Pirri v. Pirri,\r\n  369 S.C. 258, 264, 631 S.E.2d 279, 283 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  In this case, however,\r\n  Husband has expressed valid concerns that the family court automatically\r\n  accepted the opinion of Wifeâ€™s appraiser merely because the appraiser was\r\n  deemed to be an expert and never considered whether that opinion was actually\r\n  supported by the evidence on which it was purportedly based.Â  Cf. Sauers\r\n    v. Poulin Bros. Homes, Inc., 328 S.C. 601, 605, 493 S.E.2d 503, 505 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1997) (stating the fact that expert testimony was not directly refuted\r\n  does not automatically entitle the party offering such testimony to a directed\r\n  verdict).\r\nThe\r\n  appraiser elected to use a sales comparison approach to determining the value\r\n  of the marital home and chose three comparable sales for the appraisal, two in Georgetown County and one in Williamsburg County.Â  Both of the Georgetown County properties\r\n  were located near rice fields and one of these properties had deep water\r\n  access. Â Neither feature is present in the property at issue here. Â The third\r\n  property, located in Williamsburg County, where this action is based, had an\r\n  indicated value significantly lower than those assigned to the Georgetown properties.Â  Based on his view that the higher valued property in Georgetown was closest in similarity to the marital home, the appraiser valued the home at\r\n  $800,000.00.Â  \r\nWe are\r\n  also sympathetic to Husbandâ€™s concerns that, contrary to the assumptions and\r\n  general principles on which Wifeâ€™s appraiser relied, the value assigned to the\r\n  marital home did not take into account the terms of the decree itself, which\r\n  set a deadline for Husband to pay Wife her share of the equitable distribution\r\n  in cash.[4]Â \r\n  Finally, the appraiserâ€™s own remarks comparing his assessment to an attempt to\r\n  locate a deer in the woods and his admission he could be â€œas wrong as rightâ€ strongly\r\n  suggest the family courtâ€™s finding about the worth of the marital home is not\r\n  supported by the record.Â  We therefore remand this issue to the family court,\r\n  which, in its discretion, may accept additional evidence from the parties or\r\n  order supplemental information on its own motion.\r\n8.Â  In his brief,\r\n  Husband challenged the family courtâ€™s valuation of a hunting tract that was\r\n  included in the marital estate and allocated to him.Â  At oral argument,\r\n  however, his attorney stated that the hunting tract had been sold and the issue\r\n  is now moot; therefore, we do not address this issue.\r\n9. Â Husband\r\n  further argues the family court abused its discretion in ordering him to pay\r\n  Wife the bulk of her equitable distribution in cash.Â  In support of this\r\n  argument, he cites a statement from the amended final decree in which the\r\n  family court acknowledged he would not be able to borrow sufficient funds to\r\n  make this payment and would have to sell the marital residence to satisfy this\r\n  obligation.Â  Because it appears from Husbandâ€™s brief and his attorneyâ€™s remarks\r\n  before this Court that the crux of this complaint is the value assigned by the\r\n  family court to the marital residence, and because we have remanded several\r\n  issues concerning the equitable distribution to the family court, we hold the\r\n  terms for effectuating the division shall likewise be remanded to the family\r\n  court for reconsideration.Â  See Ellerbe v. Ellerbe, 323 S.C. 283,\r\n  297, 473 S.E.2d 881, 889 (Ct. App. 1996) (remanding an issue to the family\r\n  court because related issues were also remanded).\r\n10. Husband\r\n  further argues that the family court erred in requiring him to pay expert fees\r\n  totaling $23,066.25, all of which were incurred in relation to the equitable\r\n  division, and suggests as an alternative that these fees be prorated in the\r\n  same percentages as the equitable division award itself.Â  We agree.\r\n Litigation\r\n  expenses in the family court are subject to the considerations as counsel\r\n  fees.Â  Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 533, 599 S.E.2d 114, 124 (2004).Â \r\n  In the present case, we hold that the decision to make Husband responsible for\r\n  fees that were in essence a cost to enable the family court to make its\r\n  ultimate award was an abuse of discretion, especially in view of our decision\r\n  to remand one of the issues for which part of the expert fees was incurred and\r\n  the fact that a significant portion of these fees yielded no beneficial result\r\n  to Wife.Â  We therefore direct the family court on remand to apportion the\r\n  expert fees, including any additional fees incurred during the remand, between\r\n  the parties in the same percentages and their respective shares of the marital\r\n  estate.\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nSHORT,\r\n  THOMAS, and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The amended order states â€œthat the Plaintiff shall\r\n  pay to the Defendant permanent, periodic alimony . . .â€; however, there seems\r\nto be no dispute that Husband, not Wife, was ordered to pay alimony.\r\n[2]Â  Our determination that the depositions at issue were\r\n  not properly admitted makes it unnecessary to address the arguments that\r\n  Husband raises in his appeal that (1) the depositions â€œshould have led to the\r\n  inescapable conclusion that the Wife committed adultery and was not entitled to\r\n  alimonyâ€; and (2) the family court therefore erred in failing to consider\r\n  them.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311\r\n  S.C. 335, 340-41, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (noting the appellate court need\r\n  not address remaining issues when its resolution of a prior issue is\r\n  dispositive).Â  Similarly, we deem it unnecessary to address the argument Wife\r\n  made in her respondentâ€™s brief that Husband could not assert adultery as a\r\ndefense to her claim for alimony because he failed to plead this issue.\r\n[3]Â  Husband raised the issue in a motion to alter or\r\n  amend after the remaining issues were decided by the family court; however,\r\n  that motion was dated February 2, 2007, more than one year after the decree of\r\ndivorce.\r\n[4]Â  In the appraisal, â€œmarket valueâ€ is defined as\r\n  â€œ[t]he most profitable price which a property should bring in a competitive and\r\n  open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and\r\n  seller, each acting prudently, knowledgeably and assuming the price is not\r\naffected by undue stimulus.â€\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-646","title":"Robinson v.
