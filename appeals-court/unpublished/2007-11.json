Marvin Mullis, Jr., of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tHarold J. Willson, Jr., of Greenville; Mark Andrews Allison and Weston\r\n  Adams, III, both of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In\r\n  this workerâ€™s compensation case, the Appellate Panel found Margaret McDermott did\r\n  not suffer a compensable mental-mental injury, a mental injury caused or\r\n  aggravated by physical injury, or a physical injury to her left shoulder.Â  The\r\n  circuit court affirmed the decision and order of the Appellate Panel.Â  We\r\n  affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nKentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) employed\r\n  McDermott as a general manager.Â  On June 13, 2003, McDermott slipped and\r\n  fell on a wet floor at KFC.Â  She was taken to the emergency room where\r\n  her right arm was placed in a brace.Â  She visited Dr. Joseph Gabriel on\r\n  June 16 and 23, 2003.Â  The doctorâ€™s report indicated she complained of some\r\n  â€œpain in her right arm, hand, and shoulder but is otherwise doing well.â€Â  When\r\n  she returned for a follow up with right wrist pain, he described her condition\r\n  as â€œsome trouble with some right wrist pain as well as occasional pins and\r\n  needles type sensation in her right hand.Â  She denies any new problems at this\r\n  time.â€Â  McDermott was excused from work June 16 through 22, 2003, returning to\r\n  work on June 23, 2003.Â  \r\nSeptember 2003, McDermott learned she\r\n  had been the victim of identity theft when an employee used her social security\r\n  number to attempt activation of a cell phone.Â  McDermott was never\r\n  responsible for any charges resulting from the use of her social security\r\n  number, and the situation was resolved within two months.Â  In addition,\r\n  McDermott asserts in her brief that her social security number was used in an attempt\r\n  to obtain a credit card.Â  \r\nIn October 2003, McDermott was promoted to\r\n  manager of a larger KFC.Â  On October 19, 2003, an incident (the Wrench\r\n  Incident) occurred between McDermott and an employee, Lamont Summers.Â  McDermott\r\n  questioned Summers about why there was not a sufficient amount of chicken prepared\r\n  for the lunch crowd.Â  Summers picked up a pair of pliers or a wrench, which he raised\r\n  to shoulder level while speaking to McDermott, and McDermott said to\r\n  him, â€œYouâ€™d better use it.â€Â  McDermott later became upset and started crying.Â  \r\n\r\nOn October 23, 2003, McDermott was\r\n  admitted to Richland Springs Hospital for treatment of major depression and\r\n  anxiety related to work stress.Â  The admitting physician indicated McDermott\r\n  had a profile consistent with severe anxiety, including features of dependent\r\n  and compulsive personality, and mild depression.Â  On October 31, 2003,\r\n  McDermott was discharged with (1) a diagnosis of major depressive disorder,\r\n  single episode, severe; (2) anxiety disorder; and (3) stress from work and identity\r\n  theft.Â  The discharging physician noted her condition had rapidly improved and\r\n  her mood had stabilized.Â  Following her discharge, McDermott was\r\n  treated with electroconvulsive or â€œshockâ€ therapy.Â  Previously, in\r\n  2001 McDermott was treated with prescription medication for depression and\r\n  anxiety arising out of her exposure to pool chemicals.Â  The exposure was not\r\n  related to employment.\r\nMcDermott filed three claims: (1) for the\r\n  slip and fall, alleging it caused physical injuries and a nervous condition;\r\n  (2) for the identity theft, asserting the incident caused a â€œnervous condition\r\n  (aggravation of pre-existing condition)â€; and (3) for the Wrench Incident contending\r\n  it caused a â€œnervous condition (aggravation of pre-existing condition).â€Â  \r\n \r\nThe single commissioner found McDermottâ€™s\r\n  physical injuries to her right arm arising out of her fall compensable and\r\n  denied the remainder of the claims.Â  The single commissioner found\r\n  McDermottâ€™s psychological problems were neither related to nor aggravated by\r\n  events she described.Â  These findings were based on McDermottâ€™s lack of\r\n  credibility due to her inconsistent demeanor\r\n  at the hearing, her demonstration of selective memory, and her inconsistent\r\n  speech patterns.Â  Accordingly, the single commissioner found McDermott failed\r\n  to prove by the greater weight of the evidence that: (1) her work conditions\r\n  were extraordinary or unusual compared to ordinary conditions of managerial\r\n  employment with KFC and (2) her emotional problems were neither caused nor\r\n  aggravated by unusual and extraordinary conditions of employment.Â  \r\n\r\nThe Appellate\r\n  Panel affirmed and adopted the single commissionerâ€™s factual findings and\r\n  conclusions of law as the decision and order of the Appellate Panel.Â  The\r\n  circuit court affirmed, incorporating the order of the Appellate Panel by\r\n  reference.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe South\r\n  Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for\r\n  judicial review of decisions by the Appellate Panel of the South Carolina\r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130,\r\n  134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  Under the scope of review established in the APA, this court may not\r\n  substitute its judgment for that of the Appellate Panel as to the weight of the\r\n  evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse if the decision is affected by\r\n  an error of law.Â  Stone v. Traylor Bros., Inc., 360 S.C. 271, 274, 600\r\n  S.E.2d 551, 552 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nThe substantial evidence rule governs the standard of review in a\r\n  workersâ€™ compensation decision.Â  Frame\r\n    v. Resort Servs. Inc.,357\r\n  S.C. 520, 527, 593 S.E.2d 491, 494 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The Appellate Panelâ€™s decision must be affirmed if supported by\r\n  substantial evidence in the record.Â  Shuler v. Gregory Elec., 366 S.C. 435, 440, 622 S.E.2d 569, 571 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005). Â An appellate court can reverse or modify the\r\n  Appellate Panelâ€™s decision only if the appellantâ€™s substantial rights have been\r\n  prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law or is â€œclearly\r\n  erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the\r\n  whole record.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (Supp. 2006); Bursey v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 360 S.C. 135, 141, 600 S.E.2d 80, 84\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004).  \r\n\r\n\tâ€œSubstantial evidenceâ€ is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor the\r\n  evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which,\r\n  considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the\r\n  conclusion that the administrative agency reached or must have reached in order\r\n  to justify its action.\r\n\r\n\r\nLark, 276 S.C. at 135, 276 S.E.2d at 306.\r\n\r\nâ€œ[T]he\r\n  possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not\r\n  prevent an administrative agencyâ€™s finding from being supported by substantial\r\n  evidence.â€Â  Palmetto Alliance, Inc. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 282 S.C.\r\n  430, 432, 319 S.E.2d 695, 696 (1984). Â Where the evidence is\r\n  conflicting over a factual issue, the findings of the Appellate Panel are\r\n  conclusive.Â  Hargrove v. Titan\r\n    Textile Co.,360 S.C. 276,\r\n  290, 599 S.E.2d 604, 611 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  In workersâ€™ compensation\r\n  cases, the Appellate Panel is the ultimate finder of fact.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  The final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved for the\r\n  Appellate Panel.Â  Bass v. Kenco Group,366 S.C. 450, 458, 622 S.E.2d 577,\r\n  581 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  Mental Injury\r\nMcDermott\r\n  contends the circuit court erred in affirming the Appellate Panelâ€™s finding that\r\n  her mental injury did not arise out of her compensable physical injury and the\r\n  stressful incidents at work.Â  McDermott asserts all expert medical opinion submitted\r\n  indicated her mental condition was caused and aggravated by the work\r\n  incidents.Â  We disagree.  \r\nâ€œA mental-mental injury is a purely mental injury\r\n  resulting from emotional stimuli.â€ Â Doe v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Disabilities &amp;\r\n    Special Needs, 364 S.C. 411, 418, 613 S.E.2d 785, 788 (Ct. App. 2005). Â In\r\n  order to receive benefits for a mental-mental injury unaccompanied by a\r\n  physical injury, a claimant must demonstrate the stressful employment\r\n  conditions causing the mental injury were extraordinary and unusual in\r\n  comparison to the normal conditions of the employment. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2006).Â  However, where the mental injury is induced by\r\n  physical injury, it is not necessary that it result from unusual or\r\n  extraordinary conditions of employment. Â Bass v. Kenco Group, 366 S.C. 450, 465, 622\r\n  S.E.2d 577, 584 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Thus, mental injuries are compensable if induced either by\r\n  physical injury or by unusual or extraordinary conditions of employment. Getsinger v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 335 S.C. 77, 80, 515 S.E.2d 104, 105 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nThe right of a claimant to compensation for\r\n  aggravation of a pre-existing condition arises only where the claimant has a\r\n  dormant condition which has produced no disability but becomes disabling because\r\n  of the aggravating injury. Â Anderson v. Baptist Med. Ctr., 343 S.C. 487, 493, 541\r\n  S.E.2d 526, 528 (2001).Â  Aggravation of pre-existing psychiatric problems is compensable\r\n  if that aggravation is caused by a work-related physical injury. Â Id.\r\nFor an injury to be compensable, it must arise out of\r\n  and in the course of employment. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160. Â An injury arises\r\n  out of employment if a causal relationship between the conditions under which\r\n  the work is to be performed and the resulting injury is apparent to the\r\n  rational mind, upon consideration of all the\r\n  circumstances. Â Rodney v. Michelin Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 515, 518, 466\r\n  S.E.2d 357, 358 (1996).Â  The claimant has the burden of proving facts that will\r\n  bring the injury within the workersâ€™ compensation law, and such award must not\r\n  be based on surmise, conjecture, or speculation. Â Clade v. Champion Labs., 330 S.C. 8, 11, 496\r\n  S.E.2d 856, 857 (1998).\r\nWhile medical testimony is entitled to great respect,\r\n  it should not be held conclusive irrespective of other evidence and the fact\r\n  finder may disregard it if the record includes other competent evidence.Â  Tiller\r\n    v. Natâ€™l Health Care of Sumter, 334\r\n  S.C. 333, 340, 513 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1999).Â  Expert\r\n  medical testimony is designed to aid the Appellate Panel in coming to the\r\n  correct conclusion; therefore, the Appellate Panel determines the weight and\r\n  credit to be given to the expert testimony. Â Id.Â  Once admitted, expert\r\n  testimony is to be considered just like any other testimony. Id.Â \r\n  Accordingly, in deciding whether substantial evidence supports a finding of\r\n  causation, we consider both the lay and expert evidence.Â  Id. at 341,\r\n  513 S.E.2d at 847.\r\nIn Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 161, 519\r\n  S.E.2d 102, 106 (1999), the South Carolina Supreme Court explained that, where uncontroverted medical opinions are\r\n  merely deductions drawn from certain symptoms, the final conclusion in disputes concerning compensability remains with the fact finder.Â  The court further observed that in the absence of actual\r\n  testimony from a physician in the record, it is impossible to determine whether\r\n  his opinion was based strictly upon medical symptoms reported by the claimant,\r\n  or on other medical factors. Â Id. at 161\r\n  n.2, 519 S.E.2d at 106 n.2.Â  The burden is on claimants to prove their\r\n  injuries arise out of employment.Â  Id. Â It was\r\n  within the Appellate Panelâ€™s discretion, as the ultimate fact-finder, to weigh the\r\n  doctorâ€™s opinion.Â  Id. at 161, 519 S.E.2d at 106. Â The court ultimately held, although the record contained\r\n  evidence from which the Appellate Panel could have gone the other way, there was\r\n  evidence which would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the\r\n  Appellate Panel reached. Â Id.Â  The decision of the Appellate Panel was\r\n  affirmed.  \r\nThe\r\n  only evidence that the work incidents caused McDermottâ€™s mental condition is\r\n  her testimony and doctorsâ€™ reports.Â  The Appellate Panel found McDermottâ€™s\r\n  testimony was not credible.Â  Some of the doctorsâ€™ reports indicated the work\r\n  incidents caused McDermottâ€™s mental problems. Â However, the doctors did not\r\n  actually testify at McDermottâ€™s hearing and were unavailable for\r\n  cross-examination.Â  As in Sharpe, whether the physicians formed their\r\n  opinions based solely on McDermottâ€™s self-report or on other medical factors\r\n  cannot be ascertained from the record.Â  In fact, the Appellate Panel found\r\n  McDermott â€œfalsely told a physician that someone made â€˜a lotâ€™ of unauthorized\r\n  purchases and charges in her name.â€Â   \r\nJessica\r\n  Jaques, a witness the Appellate Panel found credible, testified McDermott was\r\n  experiencing marital problems, including accusations of adultery by her husband.Â \r\n  Another manager at KFC stated McDermott disclosed that she and her husband\r\n  fought.Â  Additionally, a medical report from April 2004 indicates McDermottâ€™s\r\n  children caused her a lot of stress and she â€œfeels ugly.â€ Â An undated report\r\n  from Dr. Robert Schnackenberg indicates McDermott was upset because of a denied\r\n  workersâ€™ compensation claim.Â  \r\nA.Â  â€œNervous\r\n  Conditionâ€ Arising from Slip and Fall\r\nThe Appellate Panel found McDermott did not develop a\r\n  nervous condition because of the fall at KFC.Â  Immediately following the\r\n  fall, McDermott reported that she was anxious and nervous.Â  However, at\r\n  a follow up visit a week later, she did not mention being anxious or nervous,\r\n  and it was the last time she mentioned pain in her right arm.Â  McDermott\r\n  returned to work on June 19, 2003.Â  She did not seek treatment for anxiety and\r\n  depression until September 2003, and the doctor made no mention of any causal\r\n  relationship to the previous fall in his report.Â  Therefore, substantial\r\n  evidence supports the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision McDermott was not entitled to\r\n  compensation for mental injury induced by her physical injury.\r\nB.Â  â€œNervous\r\n  Conditionâ€ Arising from Identity Theft\r\nA compensable injury under the Workersâ€™ Compensation\r\n  Act includes only an â€œinjury by accident arising out of and in the course of\r\n  employment.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160. Â In workersâ€™ compensation, the word\r\n  â€œaccident,â€ means an unlooked for and untoward event that the person who\r\n  suffered the injury did not expect, design, or intentionally cause.Â  Yates v. Life Ins. Co. of Ga., 291 S.C. 301, 304, 353\r\n  S.E.2d 297, 299 (Ct. App. 1987).\r\nTamika Scott, the employee who used McDermottâ€™s social security\r\n  number, was a prisoner on work release.Â  McDermottâ€™s social security number was\r\n  used as the managerâ€™s code to void orders.Â  KFCâ€™s policy was that no one\r\n  other than the manager should have access to the code.Â  KFC may have\r\n  used the social security number to discourage the managers from giving the code\r\n  to other employees.Â  Regardless of the policy, McDermott gave her code to Mable\r\n  Bauknight, a team leader, as well as other employees.Â  Although McDermott could\r\n  not recall which employees she gave her code to, she specifically denied giving\r\n  it to any of the work-release employees.Â  Jaques, a KFC employee who the\r\n  Appellate Panel found credible, testified McDermott had given her the code and Tamika\r\n  Scott was one of the employees who used the code.Â  Jaques claimed other\r\n  work-release employees had the code.Â  \r\nMcDermott did attribute her nervousness\r\n  and anxiety to the identity theft when she visited the doctor.Â  However, as the\r\n  Appellate Panel noted, she misrepresented the extent of the identity theft.Â  Further, McDermott continued to work following this incident and was\r\n  promoted and assigned to a larger store in October 2003.Â  The Appellate Panel found it was not unexpected or out\r\n  of the ordinary for other employees, including prison-release workers, to unlawfully\r\n  use a social security number they obtained.Â  Therefore, the record contains\r\n  substantial evidence supporting the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision McDermott was\r\n  not entitled to compensation for a mental injury induced by the identity theft.\r\nC.Â  â€œNervous\r\n  Conditionâ€ Arising from Wrench Incident\r\nThe Appellate Panel found Summers to be credible and\r\n  his version of the events surrounding the Wrench Incident was accurate.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  the Appellate Panel concluded the incident between McDermott and Summers was nothing\r\n  more than joking between co-workers.Â  Summers testified the exchange\r\n  between McDermott and himself was a joking, playful one.Â  He testified later\r\n  in the day, she told him she was upset because he picked up the wrench.Â  He stated\r\n  he told McDermott, â€œI thought we was all playingâ€ and she responded, â€œI know\r\n  but I got upset.Â  I took it the wrong way,â€ and the two then hugged.Â  A doctorâ€™s\r\n  report from the day following the Wrench Incident does not mention it, although\r\n  the visit was for anxiety.Â  Accordingly, the record contains substantial\r\n  evidence supporting the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision McDermott was not entitled\r\n  to compensation for a mental injury induced by the Wrench Incident.\r\nSubstantial\r\n  evidence supports the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision that McDermott failed to meet\r\n  her burden in showing a compensable mental injury arose out of her physical\r\n  injury, the identity theft, and the Wrench Incident.Â  The Appellate Panel found\r\n  (1) McDermott was not credible; (2) other events in her life caused her nervous\r\n  condition, and (3) the work-related incidents were not unusual and\r\n  extraordinary conditions of employment with KFC. Â The circuit court did not err\r\n  in affirming the Appellate Panelâ€™s denial of McDermottâ€™s mental injury claim.\r\n \r\nII.Â  Physical Injury\r\nMcDermott argues the circuit court erred in affirming\r\n  the Appellate Panelâ€™s finding that she did not sustain a compensable physical\r\n  injury to her left shoulder.Â  We disagree.  \r\nThe factual finding\r\n  of Appellate Panel that McDermottâ€™s fall at KFC did not cause injury to the\r\n  left shoulder is supported by substantial evidence in the record.Â  McDermott\r\n  first complained of left should pain on April 28, 2004, over ten months after\r\n  her fall at KFC.Â  At that time, she did not relate the shoulder pain to the\r\n  fall.Â  The only evidence linking the fall at KFC to McDermottâ€™s left shoulder\r\n  pain is her testimony, which was found not credible.Â  While testifying, McDermott\r\n  seemed to be confused about which arm she injured. Â She raised her right arm to\r\n  indicate it was the one injured, while stating at the same time that her left\r\n  arm was injured. Â A co-worker who witnessed her fall stated McDermott did not\r\n  complain of any shoulder pain at the time of her injury.Â  McDermott asserted in\r\n  her brief that the doctorâ€™s report from June 16, 2003, reveals McDermott\r\n  â€œinjured her right hand, arm, and left shoulder.â€Â  However, the record to which\r\n  McDermott referred reads that she suffered â€œpain in her right arm, hand and\r\n  shoulder area.â€Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nSubstantial\r\n  evidence supports the Appellate Panelâ€™s findings that (1) McDermottâ€™s\r\n  mental condition was neither caused nor aggravated by the work related\r\n  incidents at KFC, and (2) McDermottâ€™s left shoulder pain was not causally\r\n  related to the slip and fall at KFC. Â We find no error in the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  incorporation of the Appellate Panels findings of fact and conclusions of law.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the decision and order of the circuit court is  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â We decide\r\n  this case without oral argument, pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-512","title":"State v.

Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  Joshua Greer (Greer) appeals\r\n  from his convictions of murder and armed robbery.Â  He contends the trial court\r\n  erred in excluding third-party guilt evidence.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn\r\n  the early morning hours of August 20, 2002, Paul â€œDocâ€ Reagan (Reagan) was\r\n  beaten and robbed in his home.Â  Eleven days later, he died from his injuries,\r\n  never regaining consciousness.Â  After being confronted with the inconsistencies\r\n  in his first statement, Greer confessed to Reaganâ€™s murder.\r\nIn his opening\r\n  statement, defense counsel maintained:Â  â€œNow, Iâ€™m sure the State is going to\r\n  disagree with me with what Iâ€™m going to say but I believe there are two people\r\n  who knew what happened in that house on that night and neither one of them are\r\n  in this courtroom.â€Â  The State anticipated that Greer would attempt to cast\r\n  doubt on his own guilt by directing suspicion toward William Frank â€œButchâ€\r\n  Green (Green), a witness at trial.Â  The State moved, in limine, for the\r\n  exclusion of any third-party guilt evidence Greer might proffer.Â   \r\n\r\n\tThe trial judge\r\n  granted the Stateâ€™s motion, stating:\r\n\tThe\r\n  record will show that counsel for the State and the defendant came into\r\n  chambers and the State has prepared a motion in limine as to third-party\r\n  guilt.Â  That was not studied by the Court but discussed fairly extensively by\r\n  all parties present.Â  The conclusion was that counsel for the defense will be\r\n  prohibited from casting doubt upon the guilt of his client simply by pointing\r\n  to third party guilt by such inferences or presumptions that may arise out of\r\n  the evidence but that only cause a suspicion by conjecture or speculation that\r\n  the commission of the crime was by another person.Â  That will not be\r\n  permitted.Â  That has not been revealed, nothing of that nature has been\r\n  revealed to the State.\r\n\tIt was\r\n  the Courtâ€™s understanding and counsel I believe has a clear understanding that\r\n  there is nothing to prevent a complete exploration of the facts as they were\r\n  revealed to you and will be revealed during the testimony but your\r\n  cross-examination will not attempt to point to the guilt of another but simply\r\n  point out facts at [sic] they may be.\r\n\r\nDefense counsel agreed\r\n  with the courtâ€™s ruling, responding:Â  â€œYes, sir, in order for the jury to get a\r\n  full understanding of the work that was done by the police on this case.â€Â  When\r\n  the judge inquired if the defense wanted to say anything else before the jurors\r\n  came in, counsel answered:Â  â€œNo, sir.â€\r\nDuring Greenâ€™s cross-examination,\r\n  Greer did not move to admit third-party guilt evidence or elicit testimony that\r\n  implicated Green as the responsible party.Â  In closing, defense counsel reiterated\r\n  Greerâ€™s innocence, but did not cast suspicion on any other individual:\r\n\r\n\tAt the\r\n  beginning of this case I told you that there were two people who knew what\r\n  happened that night and neither one of them are in this courtroom.Â  When I said\r\n  that I didnâ€™t suggest, I wasnâ€™t suggesting that I was going to point the finger\r\n  at someone, merely maintaining Joshua Greerâ€™s innocence, maintaining his\r\n  innocence, that he was not the one that swung that hammer.\r\n\r\nThe jury found\r\n  Greer guilty of murder and armed robbery, and the trial judge imposed\r\n  consecutive sentences of thirty years for murder and twenty years for armed\r\n  robbery.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nGreer contends the\r\n  trial court erred by excluding third-party guilt evidence.Â  In response, the\r\n  State maintains Greer never sought to argue evidence of third-party guilt and,\r\n  therefore, failed to preserve this issue for our review.Â  We agree with the\r\n  State and decline to address the merits of Greerâ€™s appeal.\r\nIt is well settled\r\n  that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been\r\n  raised to and ruled upon first by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate\r\n  review. Â State v. Freiburger, 366 S.C. 125, 135, 620 S.E.2d 737, 742\r\n  (2005).Â  Trial counsel is responsible for preserving issues for appellate review.\r\n  Â State v. Passmore, 363 S.C. 568, 583, 611 S.E.2d 273, 281 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005) (citing Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 306, 486 S.E.2d 750, 759\r\n  (1997)).Â  Moreover, the objection in the trial court must have been made by the\r\n  party raising the issue on appeal.Â  Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 324, 487 S.E.2d 187, 190 (1997).Â  South Carolina appellate courts do\r\n  not recognize the â€œplain errorâ€ rule, under which a court in certain\r\n  circumstances is allowed to consider and rectify an error not raised below by\r\n  the party.Â  Elam v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 23-24,\r\n  602 S.E.2d 772, 779-780 (2004);  \r\nError\r\n  preservation requirements enable the trial court to rule properly after it has\r\n  considered all relevant facts, law, and arguments.Â  Elam, 361 S.C. at\r\n  24, 602 S.E.2d at 780; Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406,\r\n  412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000). Â Without an initial resolution by the trial\r\n  court, a reviewing court simply would not be able to evaluate whether the trial\r\n  court committed error.Â  Staubes, 339 S.C. at 412, 529 S.E.2d at 546; Floyd\r\n    v. Floyd, 365 S.C. 56, 73, 615 S.E.2d 465, 474 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nA\r\n  motion in limine seeks a pretrial declaration obviating the disclosure of\r\n  potentially prejudicial matter to the jury. Â State v. Hill, 331 S.C. 94,\r\n  100-101, 501 S.E.2d 122, 125-126 (1998).Â  This preliminary ruling by the judge\r\n  and the testimony encapsulated within that proceeding is, in essence, a\r\n  temporary decision on admissibility.Â  State v. Floyd, 295 S.C. 518, 521,\r\n  369 S.E.2d 842, 843 (1988).Â   \r\nA\r\n  proffer of testimony excluded in the preliminary ruling is required to preserve\r\n  the issue of whether the exclusion was proper.Â  State v. Simmons, 360\r\n  S.C. 33, 46, 599 S.E.2d 448, 454 (2004).Â  A reviewing court may not consider\r\n  error alleged in the exclusion of testimony unless the record on appeal shows\r\n  fairly what the rejected testimony would have been.Â  Greenville Memorial Auditorium v. Martin, 301 S.C. 242, 244, 391 S.E.2d 546, 547\r\n  (1990).Â  If it is clear from the record that prejudice exists, the issue will\r\n  be preserved on appeal despite the absence of a proffer.Â  State v. Myers,\r\n  301 S.C. 251, 257-259, 391 S.E.2d 551, 555 (1990).Â   \r\nAn\r\n  appellant may waive his right to appeal a decision by the trial judge through\r\n  acquiescence.Â  State v. Jackson, 364 S.C. 329, 334-335, 613 S.E.2d 374,\r\n  376-377 (2005).Â  An issue is not preserved if it has been conceded in the trial\r\n  court.Â  State v. Benton, 338 S.C. 151, 156-57, 526 S.E.2d 228, 231\r\n  (2000).Â   \r\nGreer\r\n  asserts for the first time on appeal that the trial court erred by excluding\r\n  third-party guilt evidence. Â Greer did not argue the issue of third-party guilt\r\n  to the trial court, object to the trial courtâ€™s exclusion of third-party guilt\r\n  evidence, or proffer evidence of third-party guilt at trial.Â  In fact, when the\r\n  court explained the parameters of its preliminary decision, defense counsel\r\n  indicated he understood and agreed with the scope of examination the court\r\n  would allow.Â  Moreover, in his closing statement Greer clarified his earlier comment\r\n  on opening, explaining he â€œwasnâ€™t suggesting that [he] was going to point the\r\n  finger at someone,â€ but was â€œmerely maintaining Joshua Greerâ€™s innocence.â€Â  Consequently,\r\n  there is no issue raised by the appellant for our review.  \r\nPrejudice\r\n  from the exclusion of third-party guilt evidence is not apparent from this\r\n  record on appeal.Â  On direct examination Green admitted he was a prime suspect\r\n  in Reaganâ€™s murder because of his history and his record.Â  Green testified he\r\n  was â€œinterviewed quite extensively by the Spartanburg Police Department over a\r\n  very extended period of time.â€Â  Ultimately, the authorities concluded he was\r\n  not involved with the murder.Â  Without a proffer of what more Greer might\r\n  offer, apart from Greenâ€™s testimony, as evidence of third-party guilt, we are\r\n  unable to discern if the trial courtâ€™s ruling was prejudicial error.Â Â   \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  Greerâ€™s issue on appeal is not preserved for our review.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, SHORT\r\n  and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-513","title":"Vaughn v.

Myrick, both of Charleston, for\r\n  Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This\r\n  is an appeal of an Administrative Law Court (ALC) order affirming a decision of\r\n  the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC),\r\n  Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM), denying a dock permit\r\n  to Appellant, Stephen Vaughn.Â  Vaughn argues the ALC erred in finding his\r\n  property (the Lot) was not waterfront property and in refusing to allow\r\n  modification of the subdivisionâ€™s dock master plan to include a dock corridor\r\n  for the Lot.Â  Vaughn also claims the denial of a dock permit violated his\r\n  constitutional rights to Equal Protection under the laws of South Carolina. Â We\r\n  affirm[1]. Â \r\nFACTS\r\nVaughn entered into a contract to purchase\r\n  the Lot on Rivershore Drive in the Beresford Creek Subdivision (the\r\n  Subdivision) on Daniel Island.[2]Â \r\n  The Lot was not indicated on the dock master plan as having an approved dock\r\n  corridor.Â  Vaughn filed an application with OCRM to obtain a permit to build a\r\n  private dock on the Lot.Â  The proposed dock consisted of a 4 foot by 620 foot\r\n  walkway with handrails leading to a 20 foot by 20 foot fixed pierhead with a\r\n  roof and handrails. Â The proposed dock included an attached 10 foot by 20 foot\r\n  floating dock and a 12 foot by 20 foot six-pile boatlift.Â   \r\nVaughn\r\n  requested a meeting with OCRM staff through his elected representative, Shirley\r\n  Hinson.Â  OCRM Deputy Commissioner Chris Brooks and Permitting Director Richard\r\n  Chinnis met with Vaughn in October 2004 to discuss the pending dock permit.Â \r\n \r\nIn the\r\n  beginning of November 2004, OCRM denied Vaughnâ€™s permit application on the\r\n  ground the Lot was not waterfront property as defined by OCRM regulations.Â  First,\r\n  OCRM found the Lotâ€™s â€œprojected property lines d[id] not intersect with the\r\n  creek [within] 1000â€™ as requiredâ€ by OCRM regulations. Â Second, OCRM found the Lot did not â€œpossess a dock corridor on [an OCRM] approvedâ€ dock master plan for the\r\n  Subdivision.Â   \r\nVaughn\r\n  filed a request for a contested case with the ALC.Â  The Beresford Creek\r\n  Homeownerâ€™s Association (Association) moved to intervene as a party to the\r\n  contested case, and the ALC granted the Associationâ€™s motion.Â  A hearing was\r\n  held in August 2005.Â  The ALC affirmed OCRMâ€™s decision denying a dock permit to\r\n  Vaughn, finding the Lot was not waterfront property as defined by regulations.Â \r\n \r\nOn November\r\n  4, 2005, Vaughn commenced an appeal of OCRMâ€™s denial of the dock permit to the\r\n  Coastal Zone Management Appellate Panel (the Panel).Â  Vaughn averred the ALC\r\n  erred in finding the Lot was not waterfront property and by refusing to allow\r\n  modification of the dock master plan to include a dock corridor for the Lot. Vaughn also claimed the denial of his permit violated his constitutional rights to\r\n  Equal Protection under the laws of South Carolina. Â During the pendency of the\r\n  appeal, Act 387 (the Act) was signed into law[3] which substantively amended DHECâ€™s administrative and permitting procedures,\r\n  including amendments to the procedure of appeal from the ALC.[4]Â  Pursuant to the Act, Vaughn filed\r\n  and served his notice of appeal with this court on July 3, 2006.  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn contested permitting\r\n  cases, the ALC serves as the finder of fact.Â  Brown v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health\r\n    &amp; Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 520, 560 S.E.2d 410, 417 (2002).Â  On\r\n  appeal, this court may not substitute its judgment for that of an agency on\r\n  questions of fact when those facts are supported by substantial evidence.Â  Dorman\r\n    v. Dept. of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 350 S.C. 159, 565 S.E.2d 119 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2002); See Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 380, 527\r\n  S.E.2d 742, 756 (1999).Â  In\r\n  determining whether the ALCâ€™s decision was supported by substantial evidence,\r\n  this court need only find, looking at the entire record on appeal, evidence\r\n  from which reasonable minds could reach the same conclusion that the\r\n  administrative agency reached.Â  DuRant v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl.\r\n    Control, 361 S.C. 416, 420, 604 S.E.2d 704, 706 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The mere\r\n  possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not\r\n  prevent a finding from being supported by substantial evidence.Â  Id. at 420, 604 S.E.2d at 707. \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS  \r\nI.&nbsp; Waterfront Property\r\nVaughn contends the ALC erred in finding the Lot was not waterfront property.Â  Vaughn first asserts\r\n  the Lot meets the regulatory requirements of waterfront property, and\r\n  alternatively, he argues OCRM and the ALC improperly used the regulatory\r\n  definition of waterfront property in denying his dock permit.Â  We disagree.\r\n \r\nThe regulatory\r\n  definition of waterfront property, as found in Regulation 30-1(D)(52) of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006), provides:  \r\n\r\n\tFor\r\n  purposes of these regulations, waterfront property will generally be defined as\r\n  upland sites where a straight-line extension of both, generally shore\r\n  perpendicular, upland property lines reaches a navigable watercourse within\r\n  1000â€™ of the marsh critical line.Â  Waterfront property may also be identified\r\n  via an approved dock master plan where designated corridors differing from\r\n  upland property line extensions are delineated.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the ALC found\r\n  the Lot did not comport to either of the two definitions of waterfront property\r\n  contained in the regulations.Â   \r\nA.&nbsp; Straight-Line\r\n  Extension of the Lotâ€™s Property Lines\r\nThe\r\n  ALC found the straight-line extensions of both of the Lotâ€™s generally shore perpendicular,\r\n  upland property lines do not reach Beresford Creek or any other navigable\r\n  waterway within 1000 feet of the Lotâ€™s marsh critical line.Â  Vaughn argues the\r\n  testimony of his civil engineer, Greg Jones, demonstrates how an extension of\r\n  the upland property boundaries of the Lot satisfies the 1000 feet requirement\r\n  contained in the definition. However, as noted by the ALC, Jones did not extend\r\n  the upland property lines of the Lot, as required by the regulatory definition,\r\n  to reach his conclusion.[5] Â The ALC explained Jones â€œextended the eastern shore-perpendicular, upland\r\n  property line by creating an angle at the critical line and beginning a new\r\n  line towards Beresford Creek, instead of simply extending the property boundary\r\n  in a straight line.â€Â  For the second extension, Jones â€œextended a segment of\r\n  the [OCRM] critical line towards Beresford Creek, rather than extending the\r\n  other shore perpendicular upland property line of [the] [L]otâ€™s western\r\n  property.â€Â  We find substantial evidence to support the ALCâ€™s determination the\r\n  Lot was not waterfront property according to the first definition of\r\n  waterfront property provided in the regulations.Â  Accordingly, we find no error\r\n  in the ALCâ€™s determination.Â   \r\nRegardless\r\n  of whether the Lotâ€™s straight-line extensions met the required length, Vaughn\r\n  asserts OCRM and the ALC erred in using the regulatory definition of waterfront\r\n  property for the purpose of establishing criteria for the issuance or denial of\r\n  a permit application.Â  Vaughn claims the definition of waterfront property\r\n  provided in Regulation 30-1(D)(52) should have been used only for the purposes\r\n  of providing guidance in the interpretation of other regulations.Â  Vaughn\r\n  suggests that the permit application should have been considered in the context\r\n  of South Carolina Code Regulation 30-12, specifically Regulation\r\n  30-12(A)(1)(e).[6]Â \r\n  Regulation 30-12 sets forth specific project standards for tidelands and\r\n  coastal waters.Â  Regulation 30-12(A)(1), specified by Vaughn, lists the\r\n  standards for the construction of docks and piers.Â   \r\nWe note\r\n  OCRM and the ALC did not err in using Regulation 30-1(D)(52) to determine the\r\n  Lot was not waterfront property.Â  The South Carolina Coastal Zone Management\r\n  Act was passed to protect and enhance the Stateâ€™s coastal resources.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§Â§ 48-39-10 to 360 (Supp. 2006); S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-1 (Supp. 2006).Â  The\r\n  Lot is located in a â€œcritical areaâ€ within the South Carolina coastal zone.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-1(D)(14) (Supp. 2006) (defining â€œcritical areasâ€ as\r\n  â€œ(1) coastal waters, (2) tidelands, (3) beach/dune systems and (4) beachesâ€).Â \r\n  Therefore, one must apply for a dock permit when seeking to construct a dock.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-2 (B) (Supp. 2006) (requiring â€œany person wishing to\r\n  alter a critical area [to] receive a permitâ€).Â  The regulations promulgated\r\n  pursuant to the South Carolina Coastal Zone Management Act cloak OCRM with authority\r\n  to carry out South Carolinaâ€™s coastal zone policies, including the power to\r\n  issue permits for docks and piers.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-10(A)(1) (Supp.\r\n  2006); S.C. Code Ann. Â§48-39-130 (Supp. 2006). Â The first general consideration\r\n  OCRM is required to weigh in determining whether to issue a dock permit, or any\r\n  other â€œcritical areaâ€ permit, is â€œ[t]he extent to which the activity requires a\r\n  waterfront location or is economically enhanced by its proximity to water.â€Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-11(B)(1) (Supp. 2006).Â  The construction and use of a\r\n  dock are clearly activities that require a waterfront location.Â  See, e.g.,\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-12(A)(1) (Supp. 2006) (describing a dock as a\r\n  â€œstructure built over and/or floating on water . . . generally used for the\r\n  mooring of boatsâ€).Â  Therefore, as the ALC noted:  \r\n\r\n\t[W]hile\r\n  Regulation 30-1(D)(52) is a purely definitional section, not a substantive dock\r\n  permitting regulation, the definition of â€˜waterfront propertyâ€™ provided in that\r\n  section is important for determining whether a proposed dock project is located\r\n  in a â€˜waterfront locationâ€™ and thus can satisfy the first general consideration\r\n  for evaluating critical area activities under the Coastal Zone Management Act\r\n  and OCRMâ€™s regulations. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, OCRM\r\n  and the ALC properly considered Regulation 30-1(D)(52) to determine the Lot was not a waterfront property.\r\n \r\nB.&nbsp; Identification on\r\n  a Dock Master Plan\r\nThe ALC also found\r\n  the Lot was not identified on a dock master plan for the Subdivision, such as to\r\n  satisfy the second definition of waterfront property.Â  The ALC acknowledged Vaughnâ€™s\r\n  efforts to have the dock master plan amended to include a dock corridor for the\r\n  Lot, but concluded the Lot was not identified as waterfront property with a\r\n  dock corridor on the most current version of the dock master plan.Â   \r\nVaughn again\r\n  asserts OCRM and the ALC erred in using the regulatory definition of waterfront\r\n  property.Â  Vaughn contends nothing in the regulations mandates a denial of a\r\n  dock permit if a lot does not have an established dock corridor on an approved\r\n  dock master plan.Â  Vaughn suggests the regulations only require a dock master plan\r\n  be used as a â€œframeworkâ€ for future permitting decisions.Â  Thus, Vaughn asserts\r\n  it was unlawful regulation and an error of law for OCRM and the ALC to base\r\n  their denial on the fact the Lot was not indicated in the dock master plan.\r\n \r\nAs discussed above, OCRMâ€™s and the ALCâ€™s reliance on the definition of waterfront property and the\r\n  adherence to the requirements contained in the definitions were proper.Â  Further,\r\n  we find substantial evidence to support the ALCâ€™s determination that the Lot was not waterfront property according to the second definition of waterfront property\r\n  provided in the regulations.Â  Accordingly, we find no error in the ALCâ€™s\r\n  determination.\r\nII.&nbsp; Modification\r\nVaughn also claims\r\n  the ALC erred in not allowing the dock master plan to be modified.Â  Vaughn\r\n  argues modification of the dock master plan was proper based on new information\r\n  regarding the Lot and the Subdivisionâ€™s restrictive covenants did not prevent a\r\n  modification of the dock master plan, as asserted by the ALC. Â \r\nThe ALC did not\r\n  actually make the ruling which Vaughn raises to this court.Â  The ALC noted in\r\n  its findings of fact that the Lot was subject to the terms and conditions of\r\n  the Subdivisionâ€™s Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions, but\r\n  did so to illustrate the Lot was not indicated on the current version of the dock\r\n  master plan.Â  Nowhere within its order does the ALC indicate that the dock\r\n  master plan may not be modified in the future.Â  Accordingly, this issue is not\r\n  preserved for our review, and we decline to address it.Â  In re Michael H., 360 S.C. 540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729, 732 (2004) (holding that issues must be\r\n  raised and ruled upon in the trial court to be preserved for appellate review); Ellie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 103, 594 S.E.2d 485, 498 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004) (finding â€œwithout an initial ruling by the trial court, a reviewing court\r\n  simply would not be able to evaluate whether the trial court committed errorâ€). \r\n \r\nIII.&nbsp; Equal Protection\r\nLastly, Vaughn\r\n  contends his rights to Equal Protection were violated by the ALCâ€™s decision.Â \r\n  The gravamen of Vaughnâ€™s argument is that he is similarly situated to several\r\n  other lot owners in the Subdivision who have obtained dock permits.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â   \r\nVaughn is in a\r\n  different position than the other lot owners in the Subdivision because the Lot was never depicted on the dock master plan as showing a dock corridor.Â  The other lots\r\n  in the neighborhood, which have obtained dock permits, are shown on the dock\r\n  master plan as having a dock corridor.Â  Thus, we find Vaughn is not similarly\r\n  situated to others in the Subdivision, and the ALCâ€™s order does not violate\r\n  Vaughnâ€™s constitutional rights.Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find substantial evidence to support the ALCâ€™s\r\n  determination that the Lot was not waterfront property according to the\r\n  definition of waterfront property provided in the regulations and thus, find no\r\n  error in the ALCâ€™s determination.Â  Further, we find reliance on the regulatory\r\n  definition of waterfront property in determining the Lot was not waterfront property\r\n  was proper.Â  Next, we hold Vaughnâ€™s claim the ALC erred in not allowing the dock\r\n  master plan to be modified is not preserved for our review.Â  Lastly, we hold\r\n  Vaughnâ€™s constitutional rights were not violated by the ALCâ€™s decision.Â  Based\r\n  on the foregoing, the final order of the ALC is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and THOMAS, JJ., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur. \r\n \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] After Vaughn filed this appeal, the Lot was sold to\r\n  SDJ, LLC, an entity in which Vaughn is a principal.Â   \r\n[3] The â€œeffective dateâ€ of the Act is July 1, 2006.Â  \r\n \r\n[4] Prior to the enactment of the Act, the Panel had\r\n  jurisdiction to review final decisions of the ALC.Â  S.C.

Â§1-23-610 (Supp.\r\n  2006)).Â  Under the Act, the court of appeals now has jurisdiction over appeals\r\n  from final decisions of the ALC.Â  See Act 387 Â§Â§ 5, 15.Â Â  Section 57\r\n  requires the Act to apply â€œto any actions pending on or after the effective\r\n  date.â€Â  However, it also creates an exception to this general rule of\r\n  applicability and mandates the former law continue to apply to â€œappeals of Department\r\n  of Health and Environmental Control, Ocean and Coastal Resource Management and\r\n  Environmental Quality Control permits that are before the Administrative Law\r\n  Court on the effective date of this act and petitions for judicial review that\r\n  are pending before the circuit court.â€Â  See Chem-Nuclear Syss., LLC v.

Â Granting\r\n  Bensonâ€™s petition, the trial court ordered a new trial.Â  The State petitioned\r\n  this court for certiorari.Â  The parties briefed the issues and after review, we\r\n  reverse.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nBenson\r\n  pled guilty to two counts of trafficking crack cocaine and one count of\r\n  possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine. Â After a plea hearing, the\r\n  trial judge sentenced Benson to concurrent imprisonment terms of fifteen years\r\n  on each trafficking charge and ten years on the possession charge. Â Benson did\r\n  not appeal.Â   \r\nBenson later filed\r\n  this PCR action alleging, among other claims, that his counsel was ineffective\r\n  in:Â  1) failing to properly investigate a search and seizure issue; and 2)\r\n  failing to advise Benson of his right to challenge the search and seizure at a\r\n  trial.Â   \r\nAt the plea\r\n  hearing, Benson admitted telling his counsel one version of the underlying\r\n  facts.Â  The judge questioned Benson about whether counsel explained potential\r\n  defenses.Â  Plea counsel confirmed, stating:Â  â€œ[W]e discussed the exclusion of\r\n  evidence and the possibilities there and discussed perhaps the legal searches\r\n  and seizures.â€Â  Benson agreed, stating: Â â€œI recall we talked about search and\r\n  seizure.â€ Â Benson then admitted he did not have a defense and knew of no reason\r\n  why he should not be found guilty.Â  The judge explained Bensonâ€™s rights to him\r\n  and the solicitor recited the facts.  \r\nThe\r\n  recital indicated that following a traffic stop on February 3, 1999, Benson\r\n  consented to a vehicle search resulting in the discovery of crack cocaine.Â  The\r\n  solicitor also stated that on June 9, 2000, the police stopped Benson after\r\n  receiving information from a confidential informant that Benson was\r\n  transporting drugs. Â Benson gave the officers permission to search his vehicle\r\n  and person. Â When nothing was located, Benson allowed the officers to search\r\n  his residence and â€œbasically told [the officers] where the drugs were\r\n  located.â€Â  Benson agreed with the facts as presented and pled guilty.  \r\nAt the PCR hearing,\r\n  Benson argued plea counsel failed to investigate. Â Additionally, Benson provided\r\n  a different version of the underlying facts.Â  Under this version, Bensonâ€™s first\r\n  stop occurred as a result of his speeding.  \r\nThe officer found Benson had\r\n  an outstanding arrest warrant and placed him in the back of the patrol car.Â  Benson\r\n  then consented to a search of the car. Â The search turned up a film canister containing\r\n  drugs.Â   \r\nAs\r\n  to the second search, Benson testified he was stopped as a result of a\r\n  confidential informantâ€™s tip. Â Benson allowed the officers to search his car\r\n  and when they found nothing they searched Bensonâ€™s person and found a key. Â Using\r\n  the key, the officers attempted to open four different apartments.Â  The key fit\r\n  the door to Bensonâ€™s girlfriendâ€™s apartment.Â  Benson stated the officers found\r\n  the drugs in her apartment only after interrogating Benson and threatening to\r\n  arrest his girlfriend and take his child. Â Benson admitted to ownership of the\r\n  drugs.Â   \r\nBenson alleged he\r\n  told his plea counsel this version of the facts and argued counsel was\r\n  ineffective for failing to investigate and failing to move for suppression of\r\n  the drugs and Bensonâ€™s confession.Â  Benson averred his counsel never told him\r\n  of his right to have a suppression hearing and if he had known he would not\r\n  have pled guilty. Â When questioned regarding his admittance of the facts as\r\n  presented at the plea hearing he stated:Â  â€œWell, I didnâ€™t know I was violated â€“\r\n  my Constitutional rights were violated.Â  I was ignorant of the law and I didnâ€™t\r\n  know and I was thinking I was going to do five years of a fifteen year\r\n  sentence.â€Â   \r\nPlea\r\n  counsel testified at the PCR hearing stating the facts as recited at the plea hearing\r\n  were as described to him by Benson and consistent with the incident reports.Â  Also,\r\n  counsel testified that if Benson had wanted to go to trial, counsel would have\r\n  filed a motion to suppress.Â Â Â   \r\nThe\r\n  PCR court found trial counsel ineffective for failure to investigate and\r\n  properly advise Benson that a motion to exclude would have been successful\r\n  based on: Â 1) an unlawful detention by the officers after a routine traffic\r\n  stop; and 2) an illegal warrantless search.Â  The court also found the State\r\n  offered no evidence on the legality of the search other than the testimony of\r\n  the plea counsel. Â The court thus granted PCR and ordered a new trial.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe appellate court gives great deference to the post-conviction \r\nrelief courtâ€™s findings of fact and conclusions of law.Â  Dempsey v. State, 363\r\n  S.C. 365, 368, 610 S.E.2d 812, 814 (2005). Â On review, a PCR judgeâ€™s findings\r\n  will be upheld if there is any evidence of probative value sufficient to\r\n  support them. Â Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626\r\n  (1989).Â  The Court will not uphold the findings when there is no probative\r\n  evidence to support them.Â  Holland v. State, 322 S.C. 111, 113, 470\r\n  S.E.2d 378, 379 (1996).Â   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe State contends\r\n  the PCR court erred in finding there was probative evidence to support Bensonâ€™s\r\n  claims that plea counsel was ineffective and that Benson should receive a new\r\n  trial.Â  We agree.Â   \r\nWhen\r\n  alleging ineffective assistance of counsel after a guilty plea, an applicant in\r\n  a PCR action must show:Â  1) counselâ€™s representation fell below an objective\r\n  standard of reasonableness; and 2) but for counselâ€™s unprofessional errors,\r\n  there is a reasonable probability the applicant would not have pled guilty but\r\n  would have insisted upon going to trial.Â  Jordan v. State, 297\r\n  S.C. 52, 54, 374 S.E.2d 683, 684 (1988).Â  The burden is on the applicant in a\r\n  post-conviction proceeding to prove the allegations in his application.Â  Butler v. State, 286 S.C. 441, 442, 334 S.E.2d 813, 814 (1985).Â  \r\n \r\nThe\r\n  PCR court essentially found plea counsel ineffective for failure to investigate\r\n  and failure to request a suppression hearing based on the applicantâ€™s testimony\r\n  at the PCR hearing.[2]Â \r\n  We conclude the focus must be on whether the plea counsel was ineffective based\r\n    on the knowledge he had at the time of the plea.Â  See Harres v.\r\n      Leeke, 282 S.C. 131, 133, 318 S.E.2d 360, 361 (1984) (review of a PCR\r\n  action arising from a guilty plea requires an examination of the records of\r\n  both the plea proceeding and the PCR hearing).\r\nThe\r\n  record does not contain probative evidence to support the finding that plea counsel\r\n  was ineffective in failing to investigate and file a motion to suppress based\r\n  on the facts evident at the time of the plea hearing.Â  Benson admitted to the\r\n  Stateâ€™s version of the facts at the plea hearing.Â  These facts were consistent\r\n  with the incident reports and plea counselâ€™s PCR testimony recollecting his\r\n  knowledge at the time of the plea hearing. Â The routine nature of a plea\r\n  hearing is not an invitation to answer queries untruthfully.Â  Wolfe v. State,&nbsp;326\r\n  S.C. 158, 164-65, 485 S.E.2d 367, 370-71&nbsp;(1997).Â  Furthermore, counsel\r\n  error is generally cured by an applicantâ€™s acknowledgements at a plea hearing.Â  See id. (finding any possible error by trial counsel cured by\r\n  applicantâ€™s acknowledgements at the plea hearing).Â  Here, because Benson acknowledged at the plea hearing\r\n  that the facts were as recited by the solicitor, there was no need for counsel\r\n  to investigate or move to suppress the evidence.Â  Ergo, we find no ineffective\r\n  representation of counsel.Â Â   \r\nMoreover,\r\n  we find that plea counselâ€™s negotiations on Bensonâ€™s behalf proved advantageous.Â \r\n  The plea court accepted the negotiated plea of fifteen years imprisonment for\r\n  the trafficking offenses and ten years on the possession with intent to\r\n  distribute offense, all to run concurrently.Â  These offenses carry maximum\r\n  terms that could have resulted in sentences requiring Benson to serve a much\r\n  longer prison term.Â  See Bright\r\n    v. State, 365 S.C. 355, 359-60, 618\r\n  S.E.2d 296, 298&nbsp;(2005) (considering trial counselâ€™s plea negotiation\r\n  efforts and results in PCR action alleging ineffective assistance of counsel).\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the order granting PCR and a new trial is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., STILWELL, J., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â We note the ultimate issues regarding the legality of the stops,\r\n  searches, and admissibility of the evidence were not proper for consideration\r\n  on post-conviction relief.Â  See Simmons v. State, 264 S.C. 417,\r\n  422-23, 215 S.E.2d 883, 885 (1975) (finding post-conviction relief action not\r\n  proper forum to determine sufficiency of evidence issue).Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-524","title":"SC Department of Social Services v.

Justice, of Chester, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this criminal case, we\r\n  affirm the trial courtâ€™s determination that Manley Thompson (Thompson)\r\n  knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel.Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nLancaster County police officers observed Thompson\r\n  riding a dirt bike and stopped him because the dirt bike was not street legal.Â \r\n  The officers asked Thompson for his identification.Â  Thompson refused and\r\n  became abusive.Â  The officers informed Thompson he was under arrest for vehicle\r\n  violation and disorderly conduct.Â   \r\nWhile attempting to handcuff Thompson, Thompson head butted one of\r\n  the officers.Â  The injured officer sustained a black eye and a bloody lip.Â  The\r\n  search incident to the arrest revealed a large quantity of marijuana along with\r\n  scales on Thompsonâ€™s person.Â  The officers also learned the dirt bike was\r\n  stolen.Â   \r\nThompson was indicted for receiving stolen goods over $1,000 but\r\n  less than $5,000, resisting arrest, and possession with intent to distribute\r\n  marijuana.Â  Thompson entered guilty pleas to all three charges and received\r\n  five years imprisonment, to run concurrently.Â   \r\nOn appeal, Thompson argues he did not knowingly and intelligently\r\n  waive his right to counsel.Â  Thompson also contends his guilty plea was not\r\n  freely, intelligently, and voluntarily given.  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, this Court reviews errors of law only.Â  State\r\n  v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  An appellate court\r\n  is bound by the trial judgeâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly\r\n  erroneous.Â  Id.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThompson initially argues he did not knowingly and intelligently\r\n  waive his right to counsel.Â  It is well established that a criminal defendant\r\n  may waive his constitutional right to counsel and proceed pro se.Â  Dearybury\r\n    v. State, 367 S.C. 34, 39, 625 S.E.2d 212, 215 (2006).Â Â  Even if a â€œdefendantâ€™s\r\n  decision to proceed pro se may be to the defendantâ€™s own detriment, it must be\r\n  honored . . . .â€Â  Id.Â  However, to establish a valid wavier of counsel,\r\n  the accused must be informed of the right to counsel and adequately warned of\r\n  the dangers of self-representation.Â  Prince v. State, 301 S.C. 422,\r\n  423-24, 392 S.E.2d 462, 463 (1990).\r\nThe\r\n  following testimony confirms the trial judge advised Thompson of his right to\r\n  counsel and warned him of the dangers of self-representation.  \r\n\r\n\tThe Court: You understand that you have a right to an attorney to\r\n  represent you in regards to these three charges.\r\n\tThe Defendant: Yes, sir.\r\n\tThe Court: You understand if you cannot afford an attorney the\r\n  State would be required to appoint an attorney to represent you at no cost to\r\n  you.\r\n\tThe Defendant: Yes, sir.\r\n\tThe Court: You understand that an attorney could be of benefit to\r\n  you by knowing things about the case or about you or about the law that could\r\n  benefit you.Â  You understand that.\r\n\tThe Defendant: Yes, sir.\r\n\tThe Court: You understand that since youâ€™re not an attorney there\r\n  is a danger in your representing yourself.\r\n\tThe Defendant: Yes, sir.\r\n\tThe Court: Knowing those things do you wish to have an attorney or\r\n  proceed without one?\r\n\tThe Defendant: Wish to proceed without one.\r\n\tThe Court: I find Mr. Thompson has freely, voluntarily, knowingly,\r\n  and intelligently, understanding his right to counsel, benefits of counsel and\r\n  the danger of self-representation waiving his right to counsel.Â  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  foregoing demonstrates the trial judge informed Thompson of his constitutional\r\n  right to counsel and advised Thompson of the dangers of self-representation.\r\n \r\nNext, Thompson argues his guilty plea was not freely, intelligently, and\r\n  voluntarily given.Â  However, Thompson failed to raise the issue regarding the\r\n  guilty plea at the trial court level.Â  The proper venue in such a case is for\r\n  Thompson to file for post conviction relief.Â  In Interest of Antonio H.,\r\n  324 S.C. 120, 122, 477 S.E.2d 713, 714 (1996) (â€œThe proper avenue in which to\r\n  challenge a guilty plea which is not objected to at the time of its entry is\r\n  through post conviction relief.â€).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s decision is  \r\nAFFIRMED.[1] \r\nANDERSON,\r\n  and WILLIAMS, JJ., A.J.

Hood Temple, of Florence, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  In this workersâ€™ compensation action, Little Pee Dee Farms (Pee Dee) and Legion Insurance Company/South Carolina\r\n  Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association (collectively Appellants)\r\n  appeal the circuit courtâ€™s order affirming the finding of the South Carolina\r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (Commission) of Thomas McSwainâ€™s (Claimant) applicable\r\n  compensation rate.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nPee\r\n  Dee is a general partnership in which\r\n  Claimant is an equal, one-third partner, with Claimantâ€™s mother and father\r\n  comprising the rest of the partnership.Â  In July 2001, Claimant suffered\r\n  injuries to both of his heels in the course and scope of his employment.Â \r\n  Thereafter, Claimant had two surgeries on his injured heels, and Appellants\r\n  commenced temporary total disability payments totaling $416.67 per week. \r\n \r\nIn\r\n  November 2004, Legion Insurance Company filed for bankruptcy and went into\r\n  liquidation.Â  Pursuant to Section 38-31-40 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006),\r\n  a statutorily created association was appointed to assume responsibility for\r\n  Claimantâ€™s file.Â  Upon review of Claimantâ€™s federal and state income tax\r\n  returns, Appellants filed a Form 21 Employerâ€™s Request for Hearing with the Commission,\r\n  requesting an evaluation of Claimantâ€™s compensation rate.Â   \r\nA\r\n  hearing was held before the Single Commissioner to determine if the compensation\r\n  rate should be maintained at its current level or be reduced; the Commissioner\r\n  held the weekly compensation rate was to remain at $416.67.Â  Specifically, the\r\n  Commissioner determined the Claimantâ€™s average weekly wage should not account\r\n  for any losses or debts attributable to Claimantâ€™s partnership interest.Â  Appellants\r\n  filed a timely Form 30 Application for Full Commission Appellate Panel Review, and\r\n  the Appellate Panel affirmed the Single Commissioner, adopting the findings in\r\n  full.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nFollowing a timely appeal and hearing on the matter,\r\n  the circuit court found the decision of the Appellate Panel to be supported by\r\n  substantial evidence and affirmed the decision.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative\r\n  Procedures Act applies to appeals from decisions of the Commission.Â  Lark v.\r\n    Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  In an\r\n  appeal from the Appellate Panel, neither this Court nor the circuit court may\r\n  substitute its judgment for that of the Appellate Panel in regards to the\r\n  weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but it may reverse when the\r\n  decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C.\r\n  613, 617, 571 S.E.2d 92, 95 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nâ€œAny review of the [Appellate\r\n  Panelâ€™s] factual findings is governed by the substantial evidence standard.â€Â  Lockridge\r\n    v. Santens of Am., Inc., 344 S.C. 511, 515, 544 S.E.2d 842, 844 (Ct. App.\r\n  2001). â€œSubstantial evidence is evidence that, in viewing the record as a\r\n  whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the same conclusion that the\r\n  [Appellate Panel] reached.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œThe possibility of drawing two\r\n  inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\r\n  agencyâ€™s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.â€ Â Lee v.\r\n    Harborside CafÃ©, 350 S.C. 74, 78, 564 S.E.2d 354, 356 (Ct. App. 2002)\r\n  (internal quotations and citations omitted). Â Accordingly, we limit review to\r\n  deciding whether the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision is unsupported by substantial\r\n  evidence or is controlled by some error of law.Â  Corbin, 351 S.C. at\r\n  617, 571 S.E.2d at 95.Â   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants\r\n  contend the circuit court erred in affirming the Appellate Panel.Â  We disagree.Â Â  \r\n \r\nAppellants\r\n  have failed to show the findings of the Appellate Panel are unsupported by\r\n  substantial evidence.Â  Claimant presented Dal Felkel, an accountant for\r\n  fifty-four years, who testified he had personally prepared the tax forms of\r\n  both Pee Dee and Claimant.Â  Upon direct examination, Felkel asserted Claimantâ€™s\r\n  salary for the immediate four preceding quarters was $32,500.Â  The average\r\n  weekly wage of an employee for workersâ€™ compensation purposes is defined as\r\n  â€œthe earnings of the injured employee in the employment in which [they were]\r\n  working at the time of the injury . . . [and] must be calculated by taking the\r\n  total wages paid for the last four quarters immediately preceding the quarter\r\n  in which the injury occurred . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-40 (Supp. 2006).Â \r\n  Using this computation method, Felkel declared Claimantâ€™s bi-weekly wage before\r\n  taxes was $1,250.Â Â Â   \r\nOn\r\n  cross-examination, Appellants questioned Felkel about the losses Pee Dee\r\n  sustained during the tax years in question and also as to Claimantâ€™s\r\n  characterizations of the income he received from Pee Dee on his tax forms.Â \r\n  However, this questioning did not dissuade Felkel of his opinion as to\r\n  Claimantâ€™s compensation in the preceding four quarters, and on re-direct\r\n  examination, Felkel specifically asserted that the $32,500 was received by\r\n  Claimant â€œ[a]s a wage over and above his share of the profits or losses.â€Â  Felkel\r\n  supported his assertions regarding the wage received by Claimant prior to the\r\n  accident, and Appellants failed to present any expert testimony to challenge\r\n  Felkelâ€™s assertions.Â  Appellants instead chose to rely solely upon the submission\r\n  of Claimantâ€™s tax return.Â  Thus, the\r\n  Appellate Panelâ€™s decision not to use Claimantâ€™s net taxable income as the\r\n  basis of his compensation rate is supported by substantial evidence.\r\nIn\r\n  support of their argument, Appellants argue this Court must follow Stephen\r\n    v. Avins Construction Co. and determine Claimantâ€™s average weekly wage\r\n  based upon net income. Â 324 S.C. 334, 347, 478 S.E.2d 74, 81 (Ct. App. 1996).Â \r\n  We disagree.Â   \r\nIn Stephen,\r\n  this Court held that a claimantâ€™s compensation rate based on his earnings as a\r\n  self-employed subcontractor should be based on his net taxable income, even\r\n  though the subcontractor was charged workersâ€™ compensation premiums based on\r\n  his gross earnings.Â  Id.Â  This Court, however, was careful to tailor its\r\n  discussion and holding to the specific facts of the case.Â  Id.Â  Claimantâ€™s\r\n  situation is factually distinguishable, and therefore, Stephen provides\r\n  little guidance in determining what the appropriate compensation rate is for Claimant.\r\n  Â Reviewing the evidence presented from both sides,\r\n  the Appellate Panelâ€™s determination of Claimantâ€™s average weekly wage is\r\n  clearly supported by substantial evidence and must, therefore, be\r\n  affirmed.Â Â Â Â Â Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  find the circuit court did not err in affirming the Appellate Panel.Â  Because\r\n  we find substantial evidence in the record to determine the Claimantâ€™s average\r\n  weekly wage was $416.67 after taxes, the circuit courtâ€™s ruling is therefore\r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nSTILWELL, SHORT, and\r\n  WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-529","title":"Adoptive Father and Adoptive Mother v.

Â Two months after Child was born, Birth Mother began\r\n  contemplating adoption.Â  In March 2005, she became more serious about the\r\n  idea.Â  Birth Father agreed to the idea because he felt it was in Childâ€™s\r\n  best interest based on Birth Motherâ€™s condition.Â  \r\nBirth Mother sought a family to adopt Child who: (1) â€œknew Godâ€;\r\n  (2) had no criminal background; and (3) already had a child so Child would have\r\n  a sibling.Â  Birth Parents found Adoptive Father and Adoptive Mother (collectively Adoptive Parents),\r\n  a married couple living in Simpsonville, South Carolina.Â  Adoptive Parents were\r\n  married and had a daughter, born in 2001.Â   \r\nOn April 16, 2005, Birth Parents each signed a surrender of\r\n  parental rights or consent to adoption (the Consent).Â  In part, the\r\n  Consent provided, â€œThis consent and the accompanying surrender forfeits all\r\n  rights and obligations which I may have to the adoptee.â€Â  Additionally, a letter dated April 15, 2005 (the Letter), addressed to Birth Parents was\r\n  signed by both Adoptive Parents individually, as well as their attorney,\r\n  stating Adoptive Parents have â€œagreed to at least three visits a year at a\r\n  mutually agreeable location and time and date.Â  They have also agreed to send\r\n  you pictures and letters at least once a month and also to provide you with a\r\n  telephone number in order to maintain regular phone contact.â€Â Â  \r\nSince the signing of the Consent, Child has lived with Adoptive\r\n  Parents.Â  On the evening Birth Parents signed the Consent, they felt\r\n  they had made a horrible mistake and regretted their decision.Â  \r\nOn April 18, 2005, Adoptive Parents\r\n  filed a summons and complaint for adoption.Â  Birth Parents filed a\r\n  motion to intervene in the adoption, to which Adoptive Parents consented.Â  Birth\r\n  Parents then filed an answer and counterclaim, which they later amended, asking\r\n  the family court to set aside the Consents and to return Child to their\r\n  custody.Â  The family court held a hearing and issued a temporary order\r\n  finding the withdrawal of Birth Motherâ€™s Consent was not in Childâ€™s best interest\r\n  and the Consent appeared voluntary on its face.Â  Additionally, the court found\r\n  Birth Father did not raise any issue as to his Consent and denied Birth\r\n  Parentsâ€™ motion for visitation.Â  Further, the family court ordered the\r\n  voluntariness of Birth Motherâ€™s Consent be adjudicated at the final hearing.Â  \r\n\r\nFollowing the final hearing, the family\r\n  court found Birth Parents had not proved the Consents were invalid or that they\r\n  were subject to any fraud, coercion, duress, or lack of voluntariness.Â  Further,\r\n  the family court determined it was in Childâ€™s best interest to remain with\r\n  Adoptive Parents.Â  The family court also found because Birth Parents had\r\n  not paid any child support for a period exceeding six months, their parental\r\n  rights were terminated.Â  \r\nBirth Parents filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP,\r\n  motion for reconsideration asserting numerous points of error by the family\r\n  court.Â  The family court denied the motion and issued an amended final\r\n  order correcting what it termed some â€œminor clerical mistakes.â€Â  This appeal\r\n  follows.\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nOn\r\n  appeal from a family court order, this Court has authority to correct errors of\r\n  law and find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 473, 415 S.E.2d 812, 814 (1992).Â  When reviewing decisions\r\n  of the\r\n  family court, we note that the family court is in a superior position to judge\r\n  the witnessesâ€™ demeanor and veracity and give its findings broad discretion.Â  \r\nScott v. Scott, 354\r\n  S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003).Â  This degree of deference is\r\n  especially true in cases involving the welfare and best interests of a minor\r\n  child.Â  Ex\r\n    parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 62, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652 (2006). Â When the evidence is conflicting and\r\n  susceptible to different inferences, the family court has the duty of\r\n  determining not only the law of the case, but the facts as well, because it had the benefit of observing the\r\n  witnesses and determining how much credence to give each oneâ€™s testimony.Â  Anders v. Anders, 285 S.C. 512, 514, 331 S.E.2d 340, 341 (1985); see also Woodall\r\n    v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154,\r\n  157 (1996) (holding where\r\n  evidence is disputed, the appellate court may adhere to the family courtâ€™s\r\n  findings).Â   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Misrepresentations\r\nBirth\r\n  Parents argue the family court erred in failing to find misrepresentations by\r\n  Adoptive Parents nullified the adoption. Â We disagree.\r\nAdoption terminates all rights of a birth parent over\r\n  the adopted child. McLaughlin v. Strickland, 279 S.C. 513, 517, 309\r\n  S.E.2d 787, 790 (Ct. App. 1983).Â  â€œThis\r\n  includes termination of visitation rights.â€Â  Id. Â If an adoption is to\r\n  be based on consent, the birth parent must agree to relinquish all rights to\r\n  the child. Â Id.Â  A qualified consent which attempts to reserve rights in\r\n  the birth parent does not sufficiently constitute consent to adoption required\r\n  by law. Â Â Id.\r\n\r\n\tWithdrawal of any consent or relinquishment is not\r\n  permitted except by order of the court after notice and opportunity to be heard\r\n  is given to all persons concerned, and except when the court finds that the\r\n  withdrawal is in the best interests of the child and that the consent or\r\n  relinquishment was not given voluntarily or was obtained under duress or\r\n  through coercion.Â  Any person attempting to withdraw consent or relinquishment\r\n  shall file the reasons for withdrawal with the family court. Â The entry of the\r\n  final decree of adoption renders any consent or relinquishment irrevocable.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1720 (Supp. 2006).\r\nSouth Carolina jurisprudence â€œdisallows the\r\n  revocation of consent voluntarily given particularly where the adoptive parents\r\n  have taken the child into their home in reliance upon the consent.â€ Â Ellison v. Camby, 269 S.C. 48, 51, 236\r\n  S.E.2d 197, 198 (1977); see also Driggers v. Jolley, 219 S.C. 31, 37, 64 S.E.2d\r\n  19, 22 (1951) (recognizing the right to revoke consent is not absolute and\r\n  noting the trend is in favor of enforcing consent when voluntarily given and\r\n  accompanied by reliance on the part of the adoptive parents). Â â€œThe South Carolina statutory adoption scheme leaves the question of withdrawal in the judgeâ€™s\r\n  discretion, assuming the Consent to Adopt is on file.â€Â  Ellison, 269 S.C. at 51, 236 S.E.2d\r\n  at 198.\r\nâ€œ[A] final decree of adoption may be vacated or set\r\n  aside because of fraud in the procurement of the judgment.â€ Â Lowe v. Clayton, 264 S.C. 75, 80, 212\r\n  S.E.2d 582, 584 (1975).Â  Parents who sign a consent to adoption waive their right to\r\n  notice or appearance at the proceeding. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1700(A)(9)\r\n  (Supp. 2006). Â Thus, if a parentâ€™s consent is fraudulently obtained, such fraud\r\n  essentially acts to induce the parent not to present a case.Â  Hagy v. Pruitt, 339 S.C. 425, 431-32, 529 S.E.2d 714, 717-18 (2000).Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the allegation that consent was fraudulently obtained sufficiently alleges extrinsic\r\n  fraud.Â  Id.Â  Generally, fraud must be proved by clear and convincing\r\n  evidence. Â Id.\r\n\r\n\tA party asserting a claim for fraud in the inducement\r\n  to enter into a contract must establish (1) a representation, (2) its falsity,\r\n  (3) its materiality, (4) knowledge of its falsity or reckless disregard of its\r\n  truth or falsity, (5) intent that the representation be acted upon, (6) the\r\n  hearerâ€™s ignorance of its falsity, (7) the hearerâ€™s reliance on its truth, (8)\r\n  the hearerâ€™s right to rely thereon, and (9) the hearerâ€™s consequent and\r\n  proximate injury.\r\n\r\nBrown\r\n  v. Stewart, 348 S.C. 33, 41, 557 S.E.2d 676, 680 (Ct. App. 2001) (internal\r\n  quotations and citations omitted).\r\nBirth\r\n  Parents assert Adoptive Parentsâ€™ failure to honor the visitation and telephone\r\n  calls as provided by the Letter were misrepresentations.Â  Birth Mother\r\n  testified she and Birth Father had not received visitation or photographs, and\r\n  she believed they would not receive them.Â  Additionally, Birth Mother\r\n  testified the visitation, photographs, and phone calls were all an integral\r\n  part of the agreement.Â  However, on cross-examination, she admitted Adoptive\r\n  Parents had not yet had the chance to comply with the visitation.Â  \r\n\r\nDr.\r\n  Blake Allen Spence, who is certified to take consent and relinquishments for\r\n  adoptions and to conduct home studies, took the Birth Parentsâ€™ Consents.Â  He\r\n  testified Adoptive Parents and Birth Parents discussed visitation after the\r\n  Consents were signed.Â  Further, he testified Adoptive Parents did not sign the\r\n  Letter until after the Consents were signed.Â   \r\nBy Birth Motherâ€™s\r\n  own testimony, Adoptive Parents have not yet had a chance to comply with the\r\n  visitation.Â  The evidence in the record supports the family courtâ€™s finding\r\n  that the Consents were not\r\n  subject to fraud.[2] Accordingly, the family court did not err in failing\r\n  to allow Birth Parents to withdraw their Consents.\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Birth Parents contend errors in Adoptive Parentsâ€™ complaint that were later\r\n  amended at the hearing were also misrepresentations.Â  These errors include the statements\r\n  that Adoptive Parents had an adopted child when in actuality the child was\r\n  their birth child, as well as Child did not own property in the state of Texas,\r\n  when it should have stated South Carolina.Â  At the final hearing, Adoptive\r\n  Parents sought to amend the complaint to correct these errors.Â  Birth Parents\r\n  objected and contended the mistakes in the complaint raised issues of\r\n  credibility.Â  However, the family court ruled Adoptive Parents could amend the\r\n  complaint because the reference to Texas was a scrivenerâ€™s error, and Adoptive\r\n  Parents could testify the child was their biological child.Â   \r\nIf\r\n  Birth Parents took issue with the amending of the complaint, they should have\r\n  appealed that ruling, not tried to label these errors as misrepresentations.[3]Â \r\n  Further, they do not explain how these seemingly minor errors prejudiced them,\r\n  and we can discern no prejudice.Â  Accordingly, we find the family court did not\r\n  err in failing to find the Consents should be revoked because of\r\n  misrepresentations or fraud.\r\nII.Â  Fitness Issues\r\nBirth Parents argue\r\n  the family court erred because issues exist regarding the fitness of Adoptive\r\n  Parents.Â  We disagree.\r\nBirth Parents\r\n  provide a litany of alleged medical conditions by Adoptive Mother.Â  They assert\r\n  Adoptive Mother takes the following medications: Toamax, Migrinal, and Botox\r\n  injections for migraines; Neurontin for restless leg syndrome; Cymbalta for\r\n  depression; Welbutrin for depression and anxiety; Lexapro for adjustment\r\n  disorder; Prevacid for gastrointestinal reflux disease; and Zrytec for an\r\n  allergic condition.Â  Birth Parents further contend Adoptive Mother has a\r\n  history of fibromyalgia, bulimia, back aches, and has chronic situations with\r\n  depression.Â  Additionally, Birth Parents allege Adoptive Mother, a doctor, prescribed\r\n  medications and refills for herself.Â   \r\nBirth\r\n  Parents cite Murray v. Murray, 271 S.C. 62, 244 S.E.2d 538 (1978), and Peeples v. Peeples, 270 S.C. 116, 241 S.E.2d 159 (1978), in support of\r\n  their argument that the fitness issues are sufficient for Adoptive Parents to\r\n  lose custody of Child.Â  Both of these cases involve birth parents losing\r\n  custody of their children to the other birth parent or a grandparent due to\r\n  mental and emotional instability, and thus, greatly differ from the current\r\n  situation.Â  Further, Adoptive Mother is on the medications pursuant to doctorâ€™s\r\n  orders to correct medical problems.Â  Many of these problems would not have any\r\n  bearing on Adoptive Motherâ€™s fitness as a parent.Â  Additionally, Adoptive\r\n  Mother is on the medications to treat her problems for depression and anxiety.Â \r\n  In regards to the allegations she wrote her own prescriptions, Adoptive Mother\r\n  also testified she only extended prescriptions for which she already had a\r\n  prescription, which did not violate any ethical rules, and she would never\r\n  write a new prescription for herself.Â   \r\nFurther,\r\n  Birth Parents argue because Adoptive Father did not testify, there is a\r\n  presumption his testimony would be adverse to his position, citing to McCowan v. Southerland.Â  253 S.C. 9, 168 S.E.2d 573 (1969).Â  In McCowan,\r\n  the South Carolina Supreme Court found when â€œfacts\r\n  were peculiarly within [a defendantâ€™s] knowledgeâ€ and â€œ[h]e did not testify . .\r\n  . his unexplained failure to do so raises an inference that his testimony, if\r\n  it had been submitted, would have been unfavorable to his position.â€Â  Id. at 12, 168 S.E.2d at 574.Â  Here, Father was not the only party that could\r\n  testify he was a fit parent.Â  Adoptive Mother, the guardian ad litem (GAL), Cheryl\r\n  Truesdale, a clinical psychologist, Dr. Joanne Armstrong, and\r\n  another witness, Stacy Garrett, all testified Adoptive\r\n  Father was a fit parent.Â   \r\nAdditionally, Birth Parents contend at the time of the\r\n  hearing, Adoptive Parents lived in a two-bedroom apartment with Child sharing a\r\n  room with Adoptive Parentsâ€™ daughter.Â  Although Adoptive Parents did\r\n  temporarily live in a two-bedroom apartment, it was only for a few months while\r\n  construction was being completed on their five bedroom home, in which Child has\r\n  his own bedroom, as well as a playroom and a backyard. Â Accordingly, the family\r\n  court did not err in finding Adoptive Parents to be fit parents.\r\nIII.Â  Best Interest of the\r\n  Child\r\nBirth Parents\r\n  maintain it is in the best interest of Child that they raise him.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œIn adoption cases the child is the proper focus for\r\n  the determination.â€Â  Phillips v. Baker, 284 S.C. 134, 136, 325\r\n  S.E.2d 533, 535 (1985).Â  Section 20-7-1720 authorizes the family court to grant\r\n  a withdrawal of consent to adoption only if â€œthe court finds that the\r\n  withdrawal is in the best interests of the child . . . .â€  \r\nAt\r\n  the time Child was placed with Adoptive Parents, his weight was at the twenty-fifth\r\n  percentile on weight charts for his age, making him severely underweight.Â  Further,\r\n  he suffered from a chronic buildup of fluid on his left eardrum, causing\r\n  partial deafness.Â  Child also never wore shoes while he lived with Birth\r\n  Parents and had an abnormality called metatarsus abductus, causing both feet to\r\n  turn inward.Â  Additionally, Child had developmental delays in his speech and\r\n  fine motor skills.Â   \r\nChildâ€™s\r\n  physical condition has shown improvement since he has been living with Adoptive\r\n  Parents.Â  After several months, his weight increased to the seventy-fifth\r\n  percentile.Â  Further, Adoptive Parents have enrolled him in both speech and\r\n  occupational therapy.Â  Additionally, Adoptive Parents had Child examined by an\r\n  ear, nose, and throat specialist, who placed tubes in Childâ€™s ears to alleviate\r\n  fluid causing Child pain and hearing loss.Â  Child has also received medical\r\n  assistance for his metatarsus abductus and can now wear shoes and bear his own\r\n  weight allowing his walking to significantly improve.Â   \r\nFurther,\r\n  Adoptive Mother is a pediatrician who currently stays at home with Child.Â  Dr.\r\n  Armstrong testified Child had a strong bond with Adoptive Parents.Â  The GAL\r\n  testified she had concerns with Child being returned to Birth Parents.Â \r\n  Specifically, when she went to Birth Parentsâ€™ apartment for a planned visit,\r\n  they had very little food in the home.Â  Further, Birth Mother testified she\r\n  intended to home school Child, which concerned the GAL because she found Child\r\n  lacked socialization at the time he was placed with Adoptive Parents and therefore,\r\n  thought home schooling would be detrimental to him.Â  Accordingly, the GAL\r\n  believed it was in Childâ€™s best interest to remain with Adoptive Parents.Â  From a review of the record,\r\n  the evidence supports the family courtâ€™s decision that revoking the Consents\r\n  was not in Childâ€™s best interest, and thus, we find no error in the decision.\r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the family\r\n  court did not err in finding the Consents should not be revoked and the\r\n  adoption should not be withdrawn because of misrepresentations or fraud.Â \r\n  Further, we find the Adoptive Parents are fit parents and not withdrawing the\r\n  adoption is in Childâ€™s best interest.Â  Accordingly, the order of the family\r\n  court is\r\nAFFIRMED.[4]\r\nANDERSON,\r\n  SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] This case is sealed, thus the partiesâ€™ names have\r\n  been changed.  \r\n[2] Further, even if Birth Parents met their burden of proving\r\n  the Consents were given as a result of fraud, they must also prove the\r\n  withdrawal of their Consents was in Childâ€™s best interest.Â  See Â§\r\n  20-7-1720.Â  As discussed in more detail in the third issue, we find the\r\n  withdrawal of Birth Parentsâ€™ consent is not in the best interest of Child.Â  \r\n \r\n[3] Further,&nbsp;Rule 15, SCRCP,\r\n  provides, â€œA party may amend his pleading once\r\n  as a matter of course at any time before or within 30 days after a responsive\r\n  pleading is served or, if the pleading is one to which no responsive pleading\r\n  is required and the action has not been placed upon the trial roster, he may so\r\n  amend it at any time within 30 days after it is served. Â Otherwise a party may\r\n  amend his pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse\r\n  party; and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires and does not\r\n  prejudice any other party. A party shall plead in response to an amended\r\n  pleading within the time remaining for response to the original pleading or\r\n  within fifteen days after service of the named amended pleading, whichever\r\n  period may be the longer, unless the court otherwise orders.â€\r\n[4] We decide this case without oral arguments pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-530","title":"Garrett v.

Garrett, of Reidville, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tMason A. Goldsmith, of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In\r\n  this civil case, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s determination that John Garrett\r\n  (Garrett) failed to follow the proper service of process requirements as set\r\n  out in the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  We also conclude the trial\r\n  court properly dismissed the case with prejudice.  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn February 28, 2005, Garrett filed a complaint against the law\r\n  firm of Lister, Flynn, &amp; Kelly, P.A. (Law Firm), attorney Toney Lister\r\n  (Lister), and attorney Brenda Delaney (Delaney) In his complaint, Garrett\r\n  alleged numerous causes of action.Â  The acts which Garrett complained of\r\n  occurred on March 15, 2002, nearly three years prior to filing the complaint.Â  \r\n \r\nOn June 10, 2005, Garrett personally attempted to serve Delaney at\r\n  Delaneyâ€™s place of business.Â  However, Delaney was not present at that time.Â \r\n  On June 20, 2005, Garrett attempted to serve Law Firm by registered mail,\r\n  return receipt requested.Â  The registered mail was not restricted to Law Firmâ€™s\r\n  registered agent, and the registered agent did not sign for the delivery.Â  On\r\n  June 21, 2005, by way of regular mail rather than certified Garrett, attempted\r\n  to serve Lister.Â   \r\nOn July 8, 2005, the Respondents filed a Motion to Quash the\r\n  Service of Process.Â  On July 25, 2005, Garrett filed his response to this\r\n  motion.Â  Prior to filing his response, Garrett filed an amended complaint on\r\n  July 11, 2005.Â  The trial court found Garrett had failed to properly serve the\r\n  Respondents.Â  Garrett argued he was unable to effectuate service because he was\r\n  disabled.Â  Garrett asked the trial court to grant him an extension so that he\r\n  could properly serve the Respondents.Â  The trial court denied this request and dismissed\r\n  the case with prejudice because the statute of limitations ran before Garrett\r\n  filed his amended complaint, and Garrett did not perfect service of process on\r\n  the Respondents before the statute of limitation ended.Â   \r\nOn appeal, Garrett makes the following nine arguments: (1) the\r\n  trial court erred in finding service to Law Firm was not properly made; (2) the\r\n  trial court erred in failing to conclude Delaney was properly served; (3) the\r\n  trial court should have allowed Garrett an extension of time in which to serve\r\n  the Respondents; (4) the trial court erred by ruling on the statute of\r\n  limitations issue; (5) the trial court erred by dismissing the case with\r\n  prejudice; (6) the trial court erred by failing to put into evidence a document\r\n  Garrett provided; (7) the trial court, by requiring Garrett to stand during\r\n  oral arguments, denied Garrett the opportunity to compete with opposing counsel\r\n  on an equal basis; (8) Garrett was denied the opportunity to check out law\r\n  books from the Spartanburg Library; and (9) the trial judge erred by failing to\r\n  recuse himself.Â  We address each argument in turn.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA. The trial\r\n  court properly found Garrett did not serve Law Firm.\r\nGarrettâ€™s\r\n  first argument is the trial court improperly concluded that he failed to\r\n  properly serve Law Firm.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nGarrett\r\n  attempted service upon Law Firm by certified mail.Â  Rule 4(d)(8) of the South\r\n  Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a partnership may be served â€œby registered or\r\n  certified mail, return receipt requested and delivery restricted to the\r\n    addressee.â€ (emphasis added).Â   \r\nThe Certificate of\r\n  Service clearly shows Garrett failed to restrict delivery as required by Rule\r\n  4.Â  Thus, the trial court properly concluded Garrett did not serve Law Firm.\r\n \r\nB. The trial\r\n  court correctly concluded Garrett improperly served Delaney.\r\nGarrettâ€™s\r\n  second argument is the trial court erred by not concluding he properly served\r\n  Delaney.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 4(c) of the South Carolina Rules of\r\n  Civil Procedure states:\r\nService\r\n  of summons may be made by the sheriff, his deputy, or by any other person not\r\n  less than eighteen (18) years of age, not an attorney in or a party to the\r\n  action.Â  Service of all other process shall be made by the sheriff or his\r\n  deputy or any other duly constituted law enforcement officer or by any person\r\n  designated by the court who is not less than eighteen (18) years of age and not\r\n  an attorney in or a party to the action . . . .\r\nhe Certificate of\r\n  Service states that Garrett personally attempted to serve Delaney at Delaneyâ€™s\r\n  place of business.Â  Garrett is a party in the law suit against Delaney, thus he\r\n  cannot effectuate service.Â  Therefore, the trial court properly concluded that\r\n  Delaney was not served.Â   \r\nC. The trial\r\n  court properly ruled that Garrett was not entitled to an extension of time in\r\n  which to serve the Respondents.\r\nGarrettâ€™s\r\n  third argument is the trial court should have granted an extension so that\r\n  Garrett could properly serve the Respondents.Â  We disagree.  \r\nRule\r\n  3(a) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides:  \r\nA civil action is commenced when the summons and complaint are\r\n  filed with clerk of court if: (1) the summons and complaint are served within\r\n  the statute of limitations . . . . or (2) if not served within the statute of\r\n  limitations, actual service must be accomplished no later than one hundred\r\n  twenty days after filing.\r\nIn the present case, Garrett filed the complaint on February 28,\r\n  2005. The acts which Garrett complained of occurred on March 15, 2002, nearly three\r\n  years prior to filing the complaint.Â  The statute of limitations for the\r\n  underlying causes of action ran in March 15, 2005.Â  Garrett failed to properly\r\n  serve the Respondents by March 15, 2005, within the statue of limitations.Â  \r\n \r\nHowever, Garrett could commence the action if he had served the Respondents\r\n  within 120 days of filing the complaint.Â  Thus, Garrettâ€™s suit would have been\r\n  timely and not barred by the statute of limitations if he had actually served\r\n  the Respondents by June 28, 2005, 120 days after filing the compliant.Â  Rule\r\n  3(a), SCRCP.\r\nAs discussed above, Garrett failed to properly serve the Respondents.Â \r\n  Consequently, the statute of limitations ran on June 28, 2005.Â   \r\nGarrett argues the trial court should have given him an extension\r\n  to serve the Respondents because he was disabled during the time period between\r\n  filing the complaint and the expiration of the one hundred twenty day period.Â \r\n  In other words, Garrett asks this Court to carve out an exception to the 120\r\n  day time period set out in Rule 3 if an individual is disabled.Â   \r\nWhen\r\n  interpreting language of a court rule, the same rules of construction employed\r\n  in interpreting statutes apply.Â  State v. Brown, 344 S.C. 302, 307, 543 S.E.2d\r\n  568, 571 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œTherefore, the words of [the\r\n  rule] must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle\r\n  or forced construction to limit or expand the rule.â€Â  Id. (internal\r\n  quotations and citations omitted).Â  The cardinal rule of\r\n  statutory construction is to determine and give effect to the intent of the\r\n  legislature.Â  Charleston County Sch. Dist. v. State Budget &amp; Control Bd.,\r\n  313 S.C. 1, 5, 437 S.E.2d 6, 8 (1993).Â  The best evidence of legislative intent\r\n  is the text of the statute.Â  Wade v. State, 348\r\n  S.C. 255, 259, 559 S.E.2d 843, 844 (2002) (internal quotations\r\n  and citations omitted).Â  If the terms of the statute are clear, the court must\r\n  apply those terms according to their literal meaning.Â  City of\r\n    Columbia v. Am. Civil Liberties Union of S.C., Inc., 323 S.C. 384, 387,\r\n  475 S.E.2d 2d 747, 749 (1996).Â   \r\nRule 3 does not state an exception to the time period provided therein if an individual is\r\n  disabled.Â  It is not within the purview of this Court to carve such an\r\n  exception.Â  See Wiggins v. Edwards, 314 S.C. 126, 129, 442 S.E.2d\r\n  169, 171 (1994) (â€œThis\r\n  Court is without authority to alter the plain and unambiguous language of the\r\n  statute.â€).  \r\nD. The trial\r\n  court did not err by ruling on the statute of limitations issue.\r\nGarrett\r\n  seems to argue the trial court should not have addressed the statute of\r\n  limitations issue because it was never before the trial court.Â  We disagree.Â \r\n \r\nGarrett,\r\n  in response to Respondents Motion to Quash Service stated, â€œAs the 120 days are\r\n  out, any decision to dismiss may conclude any opportunity to recover even if\r\n  the decision is made without prejudice since the Statute of Limitations may\r\n  have run and refiling may not be an option.â€Â  Garrett brought the issue of\r\n  statute of limitations to the trial courtâ€™s attention, and the trial court was\r\n  proper to address it.  \r\nE. The trial\r\n  court did not err by dismissing the case with prejudice.\r\nGarrettâ€™s fifth argument is the trial\r\n  judge erred by dismissing the case with prejudice.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs explained above, the statute of limitations in this case ran on\r\n  June 28, 2005.Â  The trial court issued an order on September 29, 2005, three\r\n  months after the statute of limitations expired.Â  The trial court properly\r\n  dismissed the case with prejudice because Garrett was barred from refiling this\r\n  case.Â   \r\nF. The trial\r\n  court did not err by failing to put into evidence a document Garrett provided. \r\n\r\nOn\r\n  October 13, 2005, Garrett filed a Motion to Amend.Â  A hearing was held on this\r\n  motion on December 12, 2005.Â  During this hearing, Garrett attempted to\r\n  introduce a letter from Dr. Christopher Caston The trial court declined to\r\n  consider this letter when issuing its order.Â   \r\nGarrett\r\n  does not provide authority as to why the trial courtâ€™s decision is improper.Â \r\n  Thus, we consider the issue abandoned.Â  Glasscock, Inc. v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d 689, 691 (Ct. App. 2001) (holding\r\n  statements made without supporting authority are deemed abandoned on appeal and\r\n  are not presented for review).  \r\nG. Garrettâ€™s\r\n  final three arguments are not preserved for review.\r\nIn his final three arguments, Garrett contends the trial court, by\r\n  requiring Garrett to stand during oral arguments, denied Garrett the\r\n  opportunity to compete with opposing counsel on an equal basis; Garrett was\r\n  denied the opportunity to check out law books from the Spartanburg Library; and\r\n  the trial judge erred by failing to recuse himself.  \r\nWe do\r\n  not address these issues because they were neither raised to nor ruled upon by\r\n  the trial court.Â  Wilder, Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d\r\n  731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first\r\n  time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge\r\n  to be preserved for appellate review.â€).  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s decision is  \r\nAFFIRMED.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Office of the Attorney General, of Columbia; and Solicitor I. McDuffie Stone, III, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Roderick Bradley appeals the trial courtâ€™s denial of a new trial following allegations of juror misconduct.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nA jury convicted Bradley of second-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor.Â  During voir dire, no potential jurors responded when asked if they were victims of a violent crime.Â  Following the verdict, Juror G[1] claimed two other jurors, Juror F and Juror W, stated they were rape victims during jury deliberations.Â  Further, Juror G alleged one of the jurors used her personal experience to explain why Bradleyâ€™s alleged victim delayed making the sexual misconduct allegation.Â  The trial court denied Bradleyâ€™s motion for a new trial after finding Juror G was not credible and finding Juror W did not intentionally conceal information.Â  This appeal follows.Â  \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.&nbsp; Bradley argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial following allegations jurors disclosed they were rape victims during deliberations.Â  We disagree.\r\nA trial courtâ€™s denial of a new trial motion due to allegations a juror gave misleading or incomplete information on voir dire will be affirmed absent a prejudicial abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Guillebeaux, 362 S.C. 270, 274, 607 S.E.2d 99, 101 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\n \r\nWhen determining if a new trial is warranted, this court must first determine if the jurorâ€™s failure to respond was an intentional concealment.Â  State v. Woods, 345 S.C. 583, 587, 550 S.E.2d 282, 284 (2001).Â  This is a fact intensive determination made on a case-by-case basis.Â  Guillebeaux, 362 S.C. at 274, 607 at 101-02.Â  In Woods, the South Carolina Supreme Court explained:\r\n\r\n\t[I]ntentional concealment occurs when the question presented to the jury on\r\n\tvoir dire is reasonably comprehensible to the average juror and the subject of the inquiry is of such significance that the jurorâ€™s failure to respond is unreasonable.Â  Unintentional concealment, on the other hand, occurs where the question posed is ambiguous or incomprehensible to the average juror, or where the subject of the inquiry is insignificant or so far removed in time that the jurorâ€™s failure to respond is reasonable under the circumstances.\r\n\r\n345 S.C. at 588, 550 S.E.2d at 284.  \r\nIn the case at hand, the trial court conducted a hearing following Juror Gâ€™s accusations.Â  During this subsequent hearing, the trial court asked Juror W, â€œ[h]ave you even been the victim of a crime that you consider to be a violent crime?â€Â  Juror W responded, â€œ[n]o, it wasnâ€™t a violent crime, but I have been raped.â€Â  Further, Juror W denied anyone in the juror room indicated being a rape victim.[2]Â   \r\nThe trial court found Juror G lacked credibility due to her demeanor and failure to disclose her relationship with Bradleyâ€™s family during voir dire.Â  Further, the trial court found Juror W to be a credible witness, who did not interject her personal experiences into jury deliberations and did not intentionally conceal information during voir dire. \r\n \r\nSimilarly, in State v. Sparkman, 358 S.C. 491, 496-97, 596 S.E.2d 375, 377 (2004), the South Carolina Supreme Court found a jurorâ€™s failure to reveal he was a victim of an attack was unintentional because the attack occurred forty years prior to his jury service and the juror was unsure if his attack constituted a â€œserious crime.â€Â  \r\n \r\nFurther, this court is mindful of the sanctity of jury deliberations.Â  â€œ[C]ourts should not intrude into the privacy of the jury room to scrutinize how jurors reached their verdict. . . .&nbsp; Normally, juror testimony involving internal misconduct is competent only when necessary to ensure due process, i.e. fundamental fairness.â€Â  State v. Hunter, 320 S.C. 85, 88, 463 S.E.2d 314, 316&nbsp;(1995).Â  The court in Hunter found allegations of racial prejudice to involve principles of fundamental fairness.Â  Id.Â  See also, State v. Franklin, 341 S.C. 555, 560-62, 534 S.E.2d 716, 719-20 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding calling another juror derogatory names and yelling did not rise to the level of affecting the fundamental fairness of the trial).\r\nGiven the courtâ€™s limited scope of review, the trial courtâ€™s credibility findings, Juror Wâ€™s testimony, and the interest in protecting the integrity of jury deliberations this court is constrained to affirm the trial courtâ€™s holding the jurors did not intentionally conceal information.Â  As this ruling is dispositive, this court need not address Bradleyâ€™s remaining argument regarding prejudice.Â  Hagood v. Sommerville, 362 S.C. 191, 199, 607 S.E.2d 707, 711&nbsp;(2005) (appellate court need not reach remaining issues when an issue is dispositive).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] This court abbreviates the jurorsâ€™ names, given the sensitivity of the discussed issues.\r\n[2] The trial court determined Juror Fâ€™s testimony was unnecessary because of the ambiguous nature of the voir dire question and because Bradley used all of his preemptory strikes prior to the seating of Juror F.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-533","title":"Harris v.

Harris appeals from the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of his motion to set aside entry of default and appeals the grant of summary judgment against him.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\n \r\nFACTS\r\nHarris filed this action against Kyle Smith, d/b/a Dysky Unlimited Properties (Smith) and Michael Taylor, d/b/a MTP of Columbia (Taylor) alleging fraudulent nondisclosure, civil conspiracy, and unfair trade practices arising from a real estate transaction. Â Smith answered and counterclaimed, entering into evidence a promissory note and mortgage.Â  Harris failed to respond to the counterclaim and nine months after service of the counterclaim, the court entered default on the counterclaim and set a date for a hearing on damages.Â  Counsel for Harris appeared for the damages hearing.Â  At the start of the hearing, Harris moved to set aside entry of default.Â  That same day, Smith filed a motion for summary judgment as to Harrisâ€™ complaint.Â  The court awarded Smith judgment of $12,924.00 on the counterclaim and set a date to hear the motions.Â \r\n \r\nNeither Harris nor his attorney appeared at the motions hearing. Â At the hearing, the court deemed Harris admitted Smithâ€™s Request for Admissions as Harris made no response to the discovery requests.Â  The court then granted Smithâ€™s motion for summary judgment and dismissed Harrisâ€™ motion to set aside entry of default for failure to prosecute.Â  The court denied Harrisâ€™ motion to reconsider. Â Harris appeals the order granting summary judgment and dismissing his motion to set aside entry of default.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHarris argues this court should reverse the trial courtâ€™s order because he was prejudiced by his attorneyâ€™s negligence and suspension from the practice of law.Â  We find no reversible error.\r\nâ€œIn the attorney-client relationship, clients are generally bound by their attorneysâ€™ acts or omissions during the course of the legal representation that fall within the apparent scope of their attorneysâ€™ authority.â€Â  Koutsogiannis v. BB &amp; T, 365 S.C. 145, 149-150, 616 S.E.2d 425, 428&nbsp;(2005).Â  To overcome this general rule that an attorneyâ€™s neglect is attributable to the client, the client must establish that the attorney â€œwillfully and unilaterallyâ€ abandoned the client.Â  Stearns Bank Natâ€™l Assâ€™n v. Glenwood Falls, 373 S.C. 331, 342, 644 S.E.2d 793, 798-799 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  The hearing on the motions for summary judgment and to set aside entry of default was held on March 8, 2005.Â  Harrisâ€™ attorney was not suspended from the practice of law until August 3, 2005.Â  There is nothing in the record indicating Harrisâ€™ attorney willfully and unilaterally abandoned Harris.Â  See Cassady v. Meares, 266 S.C. 352, 354, 223 S.E.2d 191, 192 (1976) (unexplained inaction of an attorney is attributable to the client and is insufficient grounds for relief from default).\r\nAccordingly, the order on appeal is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ. concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-534","title":"Lexington Insurance Co. v.

Moran, of Murrells Inlet, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Wayne Razzi (Razzi)\r\n  appeals the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in this contract action.Â \r\n  The trial court found Razzi failed to establish the existence of a valid,\r\n  enforceable contract between himself and Gail A. Moore, n/k/a Gail A. Abernathy\r\n  (Abernathy), at the time Abernathy accepted a competing offer to purchase her home.Â \r\n  We affirm.Â  Â Â \r\nFACTS\r\nPrior to July 28, 2005, Abernathy listed her home in PawleysÂ  Island, South Carolina for sale through Premier Realty, Inc. (Premier) for\r\n  $205,000. Â On July 28, 2005, The Dieter Co. (Dieter), on behalf of Razzi,\r\n  contacted Premier by fax with an offer of $180,000 for Abernathyâ€™s property.Â  Abernathy\r\n  returned with a counteroffer of $198,000 by fax. Â Razzi did not accept\r\n  this counteroffer.Â   \r\nOn August 1, 2005, Razzi faxed Abernathy a new offer for $189,900.Â \r\n  Abernathy did not alter this price, but she did counter the offer with an\r\n  additional stipulation that the home would be sold â€œas is.â€Â  Abernathyâ€™s\r\n  agent at Premier hand-delivered this counteroffer to Razziâ€™s agent at Dieter on\r\n  August 2, 2005.Â   \r\nOn August 3, 2005, Abernathy received an offer of $205,000 for her\r\n  home from a third party.Â  Abernathyâ€™s agent informed Razziâ€™s agent of this\r\n  competing offer by August 4, 2005.Â  After learning of the competing offer, Razziâ€™s\r\n  agent verbally indicated to Abernathyâ€™s agent that Razzi accepted the\r\n  counteroffer.Â  Razziâ€™s agent also sent a fax cover sheet to Abernathyâ€™s agent\r\n  stating Razzi had signed the counteroffer, but the signed counteroffer was not\r\n  included as part of that fax.Â  Having no signed counteroffer from Razzi, Abernathy\r\n  accepted the full price offer from the third party on August 4, 2005. Â Abernathy\r\n  did not receive the signed counteroffer from Razzi until August 5, 2005.\r\nThe trial court found Razzi failed to establish the existence of a\r\n  valid, enforceable contract between the two parties, and therefore, the trial\r\n  court granted summary judgment in favor of Abernathy.Â  This appeal follows.\r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhen\r\n  reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this [C]ourt applies the same\r\n  standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP. . . .â€ Â Englert,\r\n    Inc. v. LeafGuard USA, Inc., 365 S.C. 565, 569, 619 S.E.2d 12, 14 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP, provides:\r\n \r\n[Summary\r\n  judgment] shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to\r\n  interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\r\n  show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving\r\n  party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â   \r\nâ€œIn determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the\r\n  evidence and all factual inferences drawn from it must be viewed in a light\r\n  most favorable to the nonmoving party.â€Â  Donahue v. Multimedia, Inc.,\r\n  362 S.C. 331, 337, 608 S.E.2d 162, 165 (Ct. App. 2005). Â â€œEven if there is no\r\n  dispute as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences\r\n  to be drawn from them, summary judgment should be denied.â€Â  Keith v. River\r\n    Consulting, Inc., 365 S.C. 500, 505, 618 S.E.2d 302, 304 (Ct App. 2005).Â \r\n  â€œSummary judgment is not appropriate when further inquiry into the facts of the\r\n  case is desirable to clarify the application of law.â€Â  Id.Â   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nRazzi argues\r\n  the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because genuine issues of\r\n  material facts exist.Â  Specifically, Razzi contends facts are in dispute as to\r\n  whether Abernathy effectively notified Razzi of her withdrawal of the\r\n  counteroffer before she accepted another offer.Â  Razzi claims he was never\r\n  informed Abernathy had received another offer.Â  Razzi contends this dispute\r\n  over notice is a factual issue that should be submitted to the jury.Â  We find\r\n  this contention unfounded.  \r\nIt is well settled law that â€œnotice to an agent while acting\r\n  within the scope of his authority is notice to the principal.â€Â  Hill v.\r\n    Carolina Power &amp; Light Co., 204 S.C. 83, 99, 28 S.E.2d 545, 550\r\n  (1943).Â  For notice to bind the principal, it â€œmust relate to the business or\r\n  transaction in reference to which the agent is authorized to act for and on\r\n  behalf of his principal, and to matters over which his authority extends.â€ Id.Â  A principal is â€œaffected with constructive\r\n  knowledge of all material facts of which his agent receives notice while acting\r\n  within the scope of his authority.â€Â  Bankers Trust of S.C. v. Bruce, 283\r\n  S.C. 408, 423, 323 S.E.2d 523, 532 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Furthermore, an agentâ€™s notice binds the principal in\r\n  real estate transactions as well.Â  See Faulkner v. Millar, 319\r\n  S.C. 216, 221, 460 S.E.2d 378, 381 (1995) (â€œBuyerâ€™s notice to Sellersâ€™ realtor\r\n  and attorney is binding upon Sellers.â€).Â   \r\nSteve Tadlock (Tadlock), a real estate agent with Dieter, worked\r\n  with Razzi in the negotiating process for Abernathyâ€™s property.Â  Tadlock stated\r\n  in his affidavit: â€œOn August 4, 2005, [Abernathyâ€™s agent], had called me saying\r\n  that [Abernathy] had accepted a full price offer and that my buyers were out of\r\n  luck.â€Â  Tadlock also demonstrated his knowledge of the competing offer in a fax\r\n  cover sheet, dated August 4, 2005, to Abernathyâ€™s agent.Â  This cover sheet\r\n  included a message acknowledging Abernathyâ€™s agent had informed Tadlock that\r\n  another offer had been received and would be accepted.Â  In the current\r\n  situation, Tadlock was acting as the agent for Razzi for the purchase of Abernathyâ€™s\r\n  property.Â  Therefore, any knowledge Tadlock had of a competing offer was\r\n  imputed to Razzi by way of their agency relationship; it is irrelevant whether\r\n  Razzi had actual knowledge of this competing offer.Â  Tadlockâ€™s knowledge of a\r\n  competing offer was sufficient notice to Razzi that Abernathyâ€™s counteroffer\r\n  had been withdrawn.Â  Â Â \r\nâ€œAs a general rule, a mere offer to buy or sell, not supported by\r\n  sufficient consideration, may be withdrawn by the party making it at any time\r\n  before it is accepted by the other party . . . as long as sufficient notice of\r\n  the withdrawal is communicated to the offeree prior to acceptance.â€Â  77 AM. JUR. 2D Vendor\r\n    and Purchaser Â§ 22 (2007); see Masonic Temple v.\r\n      Ebert, 199 S.C. 5, 12, 18 S.E.2d 584, 587 (1942) (â€œIt is clear, in the\r\n  ordinary case, that an offer may be withdrawn at any time before its\r\n  acceptance, by notice given to that effect to the other party.â€). Â â€œIt is clear\r\n  that the law does not require a notice of withdrawal of an offer to be in any\r\n  particular form.Â  It is not necessary that the words â€˜revokeâ€™ or â€˜withdrawâ€™ be\r\n  used.â€Â  Masonic Temple, 199 S.C. at 16, 18 S.E.2d at 589.Â  Â Â Withdrawal\r\n  of an offer is sufficient if â€œthe person making the offer does some act\r\n  inconsistent with it . . . and that person to whom the offer was made has\r\n  knowledge of such act.â€Â  Id. Â Â \r\nAs of August 4, 2005, Razzi had not accepted Abernathyâ€™s\r\n  counteroffer, leaving Abernathy free to withdraw her counteroffer.Â  Although there\r\n  was never a specific statement withdrawing Abernathyâ€™s counteroffer, we find Abernathyâ€™s\r\n  act of informing Razziâ€™s agent that the full price offer had been received and\r\n  would be accepted constitutes a sufficient withdrawal of her counteroffer.Â \r\n  This act put Razziâ€™s agent, as well as Razzi, on notice that Abernathyâ€™s\r\n  counteroffer was withdrawn.Â  Razzi failed to provide Abernathy with written\r\n  confirmation of his acceptance of the counteroffer until August 5, 2005, by\r\n  which time Abernathy had withdrawn her counteroffer.Â  With only an oral\r\n  acceptance of the contract, Razzi was in violation of the Statute of Frauds,\r\n  leaving the parties with no valid, enforceable contract.Â  See Bradshaw\r\n    v. Ewing, 297 S.C. 242, 245, 376 S.E.2d 264, 266Â  (1989) (â€œThe Statute of\r\n  Frauds . . . requires, in pertinent part, that a contract for the sale of land\r\n  must be in writing.â€).Â   \r\nRazzi disputes whether the counteroffer was accepted by August 4,\r\n  2005, but we find no factual dispute as to this issue.Â  The Statute of Frauds\r\n  requires a contract for the sale of land to be in writing.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  32-3-10 (1976) (â€œNo action shall be brought . . . [t]o charge any person upon\r\n  any contract or sale of lands . . . [u]nless the agreement upon which such\r\n  action shall be brought or some memorandum or note thereof shall be in writing.\r\n  . . .â€).Â  A formally executed contract is not required for satisfaction of the\r\n  Statute of Frauds, but there must, at a minimum, be some memorandum or note of\r\n  the agreement which sufficiently indicates a contract has been entered between\r\n  the parties.Â  Honorage Nursing Home of Florence, S.C., Inc. v. Florence Convalescent Ctr., Inc., 367 S.C. 108, 114-15, 623 S.E.2d 853, 856 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005).Â   \r\nOn August 4, 2005, Razziâ€™s agent verbally indicated to Abernathyâ€™s\r\n  agent that Razzi accepted the counteroffer, but Razzi did not give a written\r\n  confirmation of this acceptance at that time.Â  Razzi argues that the fax cover\r\n  sheet sent on August 4, 2005, satisfies the writing requirement, but we do not\r\n  agree.Â  The fax cover sheet indicated Razzi signed the counteroffer, but Razzi failed\r\n  to actually provide that signed counteroffer.Â  Without a more substantial\r\n  writing, we do not find the fax cover sheet to be a sufficient writing indicating\r\n  an agreement has been entered between the parties, and, therefore, the Statute\r\n  of Frauds has not been satisfied.Â Â Â   \r\nRazzi next argues the facts of this case allow for the application\r\n  of the part performance exception to the writing requirement, thus removing the\r\n  contract from the Statute of Frauds. Â However, we do not find any factual\r\n  dispute which would make this exception applicable.Â  â€œTo remove an oral\r\n  contract to convey real estate from the Statute of Frauds, [the party trying to\r\n  enforce the contract] must show part performance of the oral contract.â€Â  Bradshaw,\r\n  297 S.C. at 245, 376 S.E.2d at 266. Â While payment of the purchase price for\r\n  the property is evidence of performance, â€œ[p]ayment of the purchase price is\r\n  the weakest evidence of part performance and will not suffice on its own to\r\n  remove a contract from the Statute of Frauds.â€Â  Id.Â  A court will only\r\n  grant specific performance of an oral contract for the conveyance of real\r\n  estate when the payment of the purchase price is coupled with possession of or\r\n  improvements to the land by the purchaser.Â  Stackhouse v. Cook, 271 S.C.\r\n  518, 522, 248 S.E.2d 482, 484 (1978).Â  Â Â Â \r\nWhile Razzi did pay earnest money for Abernathyâ€™s property, we do\r\n  not find this evidence strong enough to remove the contract from the Statute of\r\n  Frauds.Â  Razzi neither took possession of the land nor made improvements to it,\r\n  and without those acts, the small amount of earnest money Razzi paid will not\r\n  suffice to remove the contract from the Statute of Frauds.Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons set forth above, we find no genuine issue of\r\n  material fact exists, and the trial court was correct in finding Abernathy was\r\n  entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.

Bellamy, of Myrtle Beach, for Childâ€™s Guardian ad Litem.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: The\r\n  South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) brought this termination of\r\n  parental rights (TPR) action against Laquitta S. (Mother) and Anthony S.\r\n  (Father).Â  The family court terminated Motherâ€™s and Fatherâ€™s parental rights to\r\n  L. R. S. (Child).[1] Â Mother appeals the family courtâ€™s termination of her parental rights.Â  We\r\n  affirm.[2] Â Â \r\nFACTS\r\nMother gave birth to Child on March 30, 2004.Â  Three days later,\r\n  DSS took Child into emergency protective custody directly from the hospital\r\n  because of its concern Mother would be unable to care for Child at home.Â  DSS\r\n  case manager, Felicia Bellamy, testified at the TPR hearing that Mother, who is\r\n  HIV positive and has an IQ of 60, did not understand that her plans to\r\n  breastfeed could potentially endanger Childâ€™s health.Â Â   \r\nDSS prepared a treatment plan requiring\r\n  Mother and Father to undergo psychological evaluations, attend parenting\r\n  classes, and maintain appropriate housing. Â On\r\n  September 23, 2004, the court ordered DSS to make arrangements to transport\r\n  Child from the foster home to Motherâ€™s home for daily supervised visits, Monday\r\n  through Friday; the visits were to last at least two hours per day. Â DSS\r\n  contracted with the Youth Advocacy Program to transport Child and supervise the\r\n  daily visits.  \r\nFor approximately three months, Kathleen Chapman of the Youth\r\n  Advocacy Program transported Child from foster care to Motherâ€™s home for daily\r\n  visits.Â  During these visits, Chapman supervised the interaction between Mother\r\n  and Child and assisted Mother with the care of Child.Â  Chapman testified that\r\n  each visit to Motherâ€™s home lasted approximately six hours.Â   \r\nFollowing a Merits Hearing on December 9-10, 2004, the court\r\n  relieved DSS of transporting Child to Motherâ€™s home for daily visits; instead,\r\n  the court ordered DSS to exercise its own discretion over future visits.Â  After\r\n  the termination of court-ordered visits, Mother visited Child only twice from\r\n  January 2005 to July 2006.Â  The first visit, on April 2, 2005, took place at a\r\n  fast food restaurant and was supervised by Childâ€™s foster parent.Â  Following\r\n  this visit, the foster parent reported that she did not want to supervise\r\n  future visits due to Motherâ€™s inappropriate comments in Childâ€™s presence.Â \r\n  Mother did not visit Child again until December 9, 2005.Â   \r\nÂ Bellamy testified Mother contacted DSS in February 2006, to\r\n  schedule a visit.Â  Based on DSS notes regarding Motherâ€™s two visits in 2005,\r\n  DSS staff was reluctant to schedule additional visits.Â  However, in response to\r\n  Motherâ€™s continuing attempts to schedule a visit, Bellamy visited Motherâ€™s home\r\n  on April 7, 2006. Â During the visit, Mother said she was living with\r\n  Kevin Harrell and told Ms. Bellamy she planned to â€œsign overâ€ Child to Kevinâ€™s\r\n  mother for adoption once Child was returned to her.[3]Â   \r\nThereafter,\r\n  DSS filed an action to terminate Motherâ€™s parental rights.Â  The family court\r\n  found termination of Motherâ€™s parental rights was in the best interest of Child\r\n  and was supported by the following statutory grounds: Child lived outside\r\n  Motherâ€™s home for six months, and Mother had provided no meaningful support or\r\n  material contributions to Child during that period, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 20-7-1572(4); Child lived outside Motherâ€™s home for six months, and Mother\r\n  had willfully failed to visit Child after December 2005, pursuant to S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(3); Mother failed to remedy the conditions which caused\r\n  removal of Child, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(2); and Child had been\r\n  in foster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months, pursuant to\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(8). Â This appeal followed.  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe grounds for\r\n  the TPR must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc.\r\n    Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999).Â \r\n  â€œUpon review, the appellate court may make its own finding from the record as\r\n  to whether clear and convincing evidence supports the termination [of parental\r\n  rights].â€Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 609, 582\r\n  S.E.2d 419, 423 (2003).Â  Despite our broad scope of review, we are not required\r\n  to disregard the findings of the family court because â€œthe family court, who\r\n  saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility\r\n  and assign comparative weight to their testimony.â€ Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAlthough\r\n  Child left the hospital in DSS care following birth and continuously remained\r\n  in DSS care for twenty-seven months, Mother argues the family court erred in\r\n  terminating her parental rights and brings four issues for our review: (1) DSS\r\n  failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that Mother had failed to\r\n  remedy the conditions that caused removal; (2) Motherâ€™s failure to visit Child\r\n  was not willful because DSS prevented visits between Mother and Child following\r\n  termination of DSS-coordinated visits in December 2004; (3) Motherâ€™s failure to\r\n  support Child for six months was not willful; and (4) no testimony supported a\r\n  finding of severe and repeated abuse or neglect that was unlikely to be\r\n  remedied within twelve months.Â  We find that clear and convincing evidence\r\n  supports at least one ground for termination and that termination is in Childâ€™s\r\n  best interest.  \r\nIn South Carolina, procedures for TPR are governed by statute.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§\r\n  20-7-1560 to 1582 (Supp. 2006).Â Â  The purpose of the TPR statute is:\r\n\r\n\tto\r\n  establish procedures for the reasonable and compassionate termination of\r\n  parental rights where children are abused, neglected, or abandoned in order to\r\n  protect the health and welfare of these children and make them eligible for\r\n  adoption by persons who will provide a suitable home environment and the love\r\n  and care necessary for a happy, healthful, and productive life.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1560\r\n  (Supp. 2006).Â  The TPR statute â€œmust be liberally construed in order to ensure\r\n  prompt judicial procedures for freeing minor children from the custody and\r\n  control of their parents by terminating the parent-child relationship.Â  The\r\n  interests of the child shall prevail if the childâ€™s interest and the parental\r\n  rights conflict.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578 (Supp. 2006).Â  The family court\r\n  may order TPR upon a finding of one or more of the eleven statutory grounds and\r\n  a finding that termination is in the best interest of the child.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2006).Â Â   \r\nIn\r\n  this case, the record demonstrates Child had been in foster care since birth,\r\n  and was twenty-seven months old and still residing in foster care when the TPR\r\n  hearing was conducted.Â  A finding that Child had been in foster care for\r\n  fifteen months is sufficient to support TPR where the court also finds TPR is\r\n  in the best interest of Child.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Sims, 359\r\n  S.C. 601, 606, 598 S.E.2d 303, 306 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The fact that DSS proved\r\n  by clear and convincing evidence that Child had been in foster care for the\r\n  past twenty-seven months is not disputed by Mother.\r\nBecause\r\n  we affirm the family courtâ€™s finding that Child has resided in foster care for\r\n  fifteen of the past twenty-two months satisfies the statutory ground for TPR,\r\n  we decline to address additional statutory grounds for termination of Motherâ€™s\r\n  parental rights. Â Accordingly, the family court did not err in terminating\r\n  Motherâ€™s parental rights based on its finding that a statutory ground was\r\n  satisfied.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(8).\r\nMother also does not challenge the family courtâ€™s\r\n  finding that termination of her parental rights is in the best interest of\r\n  Child.Â  We address this issue nonetheless due to the courtâ€™s role in protecting\r\n  minors.Â  See, e.g., Arscott v. Bacon, 351 S.C. 44, 55, 567\r\n  S.E.2d 898, 904 (Ct. App. 2002) (â€œ[D]ue to the role of courts in protecting\r\n  minors, this court may raise ex mero motu issues not raised by\r\n  the parties.â€).Â  In a TPR case, the best interest of the child is the paramount\r\n  consideration.Â  Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579, 578 S.E.2d 733,\r\n  735 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œThe interests of the child shall prevail if the childâ€™s\r\n  interest and the parental rights conflict.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578 (Supp.\r\n  2006).\r\nMotherâ€™s\r\n  guardian ad litem, Glenn Ohanesian, testified: â€œ[t]his woman would do anything\r\n  within her power to care for this child, and she has to the best of her ability\r\n  complied with anything sheâ€™s been asked to do . . . .Â  I think that based on\r\n  what weâ€™ve heard, the testimony is already in the record that with constant\r\n  supervision and . . . the right facility that she could stay with this child .\r\n  . . .â€Â   \r\nBellamy\r\n  testified that DSS coordinated supervised visits in Motherâ€™s home for three\r\n  months.Â  The visits lasted approximately six hours a day and were designed to\r\n  help Mother learn to care for her child.Â  DSS also explored the possibility of\r\n  placing Mother and Child in a group home or therapeutic foster home that would\r\n  provide services to both of them.Â  However, Bellamy testified that these homes\r\n  indicated they could not take a â€œmentally limited mother and her baby.â€Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n \r\nDSS\r\n  referred Mother to parenting classes coordinated by Family Outreach.Â  Sherry\r\n  Coutain, Director of Education and an LPN, testified Mother attended eight\r\n  hours of infant care instruction in June 2004.Â  Child did not attend the\r\n  parenting classes; instead, Mother practiced infant care skills with a â€œdemo\r\n  doll.â€Â  Coutain testified that although she believed Mother wanted to be a good\r\n  mother, â€œI would not recommend that the child be left in her care without\r\n  supervision . . . .â€Â  When asked how much supervision Mother would need to\r\n  adequately care for her child, Coutain responded: â€œI would say she would need .\r\n  . . constant supervision.â€  \r\nFrom\r\n  September 27 to December 9, 2004, Kathleen Chapman of the Youth Advocacy\r\n  Program transported Child from the foster home to Motherâ€™s home and supervised\r\n  their daily visits.Â  She testified that Motherâ€™s home was dirty and without\r\n  soap, dish detergent, or toilet paper.Â  In addition to supervising the\r\n  interactions between Mother and Child, Chapman assisted Mother in making infant\r\n  formula and helped her operate the nebulizer and suctioning syringe required to\r\n  treat Childâ€™s asthma.Â   \r\nChapman\r\n  testified that people would come and go from Motherâ€™s home throughout the\r\n  supervised visits, sometimes taking food and baby formula.Â  According to\r\n  Chapman, â€œ[Mother] was taken advantage of greatly, greatly.â€Â  Chapman also\r\n  testified Mother did not understand the severity of her HIV condition and told\r\n  her she â€œlet people have sex for money.â€  \r\nMother\r\n  testified she no longer lived at the home where Child had visited with her in\r\n  2004.Â  Since then, she had lived with her aunt for a while and, for the past\r\n  two days, had been living with her roommate, Cal.Â  When the court asked Mother\r\n  what she would do if she and Cal had a â€œfalling out,â€ she responded: â€œIâ€™ll go\r\n  back to the mission to stay until I find me another place.â€Â   \r\nFollowing\r\n  the completion of testimony, the court noted: â€œ[t]wo years is a long time for a\r\n  parent not to get in a position to, at the very minimum, have a decent home for\r\n  her to go to . . . .Â  [T]his child has been out of the parentsâ€™ home ever since\r\n  she was removed in March of 2004, and they still donâ€™t have anywhere for her to\r\n  live . . . .â€Â  We agree and find that termination of Motherâ€™s parental rights\r\n  is in Childâ€™s best interest.  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  CONCLUSION\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, the family courtâ€™s order is  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF\r\n  and PIEPER, JJ., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1 Father and Mother were\r\n  living at the same address at the time of Childâ€™s birth; however, Fatherâ€™s\r\n  paternity was not confirmed until he took a paternity test on September 15,\r\n  2004. Â Father no longer lives with Mother\r\n  and was served by publication.Â  He did not attend the TPR hearing; however, his\r\n  interests were represented by counsel, James Young, and guardian ad litem, John\r\n  Thomas.Â  Neither Mr. Young nor Mr. Thomas had been able to locate Father.

Konduros, Family Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-538\r\nSubmitted November 1, 2007 â€“ Filed\r\n  November 29, 2007\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tDeborahÂ  Murdock, of Greenville, for\r\n  Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tJohn Michael Turner, Sr., of Laurens, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  This is an appeal of a divorce decree.Â  Gregory Rogers (Husband) argues the\r\n  family court erred in its findings concerning child support and alimony,\r\n  apportionment of the marital assets and marital debt, grounds for the divorce,\r\n  and attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  We affirm as modified.[1]\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nHusband and Giselle Bailey Rogers (Wife)\r\n  married on June 29, 1991.Â Â  They have one son, who was born in 1994, and one\r\n  daughter, who was born in 2001.Â  Wife is an elementary schoolteacher.Â  Husband is\r\n  a State Farm insurance agent with various income-producing side ventures,\r\n  including the sale of vehicles and the rental of two tractor-trailer trucks.Â  \r\n \r\nIn\r\n  1998, Wife filed for divorce, alleging Husband had infected her with Chlamydia;\r\n  however, the action was dismissed when the parties reconciled.Â  In 2004, the\r\n  parties separated again, and Wife filed the present action requesting, among\r\n  other relief, a divorce on the ground of adultery, temporary possession of the\r\n  marital home, custody of the partiesâ€™ children, child support and alimony,\r\n  equitable division of the marital property, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  In his answer\r\n  and counterclaim, Husband denied the material allegations of the complaint and\r\n  counterclaimed for custody of the children and possession of the marital home.\r\nOn September 20, 2004, the family court\r\n  held a temporary hearing, during which the parties announced an agreement on\r\n  the issues of custody, visitation, discovery, and child support, leaving only\r\n  the issues of temporary possession of the marital home, attorneyâ€™s fees, and\r\n  alimony for the court to decide.Â  Pursuant to the partiesâ€™ agreement, the\r\n  family court granted Wife custody of the children with reasonable visitation to\r\n  Husband, authorized full discovery, and ordered Husband to pay child support of\r\n  $1,000.00 per month directly to Wife.Â  The family court also granted Wife\r\n  temporary possession of the marital home, directed Husband to pay one half of the\r\n  mortgage payment, and held alimony and attorneyâ€™s fees in abeyance with the\r\n  proviso that these issues would be subject to retroactive application.  \r\nHusband\r\n  apparently failed to pay child support as ordered by the court; therefore, on\r\n  February 8, 2005, the family court issued an order requiring all future child\r\n  support to be paid through the clerk of court.Â  On March 29, 2005, a second\r\n  temporary hearing took place, resulting in an order modifying visitation, appointing\r\n  a guardian ad litem, and making certain provisions concerning extracurricular\r\n  activities of the partiesâ€™ son.Â  In addition, pursuant to a motion to compel\r\n  filed by Wife, the family court ordered Husband to produce a statement of his\r\n  retirement fund with State Farm and granted Wife $1,800.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n  incurred from the motion.\r\nA final\r\n  hearing in the matter took place on March 15, 2006.Â  By order dated June 26,\r\n  2006, the family court granted Wife a divorce on the ground of adultery,\r\n  approved the partiesâ€™ agreement regarding custody and visitation, required\r\n  Husband to pay child support of $1,484.00 per month plus $550.00 per month\r\n  towards the childrenâ€™s school and daycare expenses, set alimony at $2,000.00\r\n  per month retroactive to September 27, 2004, and directed Husband to pay the\r\n  alimony arrearage of $40,000.00 at $500.00 per month.Â  In addition, the family\r\n  court ordered Husband to pay $19,650.00 to Wifeâ€™s attorney, representing the\r\n  balance of her request for attorneyâ€™s fees of $22,950.00 less his prior\r\n  payments of $3,300.00\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn appeals from the family court, an\r\n  appellate court has the authority to find the facts in accordance with its own\r\n  view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C.\r\n  532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102 (2005) (citing Rutherford v. Rutherford,\r\n  307 S.C. 199, 414 S.E.2d 157 (1992) and Owens v. Owens, 320 S.C. 543,\r\n  466 S.E.2d 373 (Ct. App. 1996)).Â  â€œThis broad scope of review does not,\r\n  however, require the appellate court to disregard the findings of the family\r\n  court.â€Â  Id. (citing Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 279\r\n  S.E.2d 616 (1981)).Â  â€œNeither is the appellate court required to ignore the\r\n  fact that the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better\r\n  position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their\r\n  testimony.â€Â  Id. (citing Cherry Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 280\r\n  S.E.2d 541 (1981)).Â  Moreover, â€œwhen an\r\n  appellate court chooses to find facts in accordance with its own view of the\r\n  evidence, the court must state distinctly its findings of fact and the reason\r\n  for its decision.â€Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278,\r\n  283, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002) (citing Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Husband first alleges\r\n  that, for purposes of calculating child support, the family court improperly\r\n  imputed income to him that was not supported by the evidence.Â  In response,\r\n  Wife argues the family court did not impute income to Husband but simply added\r\n  non-reported and non-taxed income to the amount Husband contended was his\r\n  current income per month.Â  We agree with Wife that the family court committed\r\n  no abuse of discretion in including these amounts to determine Husbandâ€™s income\r\n  potential, but modify the base amount to which these figures were added.\r\nAccording to\r\n  Husbandâ€™s most recent financial declaration, his current monthly income was\r\n  $10,314.00.Â  At trial, Husband testified he arrived at this figure by averaging\r\n  his taxable income as reflected on his tax returns from 2002 through 2004.Â \r\n  Inexplicably, however, the family court stated that Husband â€œnow contends that\r\n  his income is $10,368.97 per month . . . .â€Â  We were unable to find any\r\n  corroboration in the record on appeal to support this statement, and Wifeâ€™s counsel\r\n  has not directed our attention to where in the record such evidence appears;\r\n  therefore, we hold any additions to Husbandâ€™s monthly income should have\r\n  supplemented a base figure of $10,314.00, not $10,368.97.\r\nAs to the additions\r\n  themselves, however, we hold the family court acted within its discretion in\r\n  including them as income to Husband. Â As noted in the appealed order, these\r\n  amounts included a car benefit of $6,600.00 per year and payment of up to\r\n  $15,000.00 per year of gasoline bills, insurance premiums, water bills, and\r\n  credit card expenses for personal use. Â Husband admitted to receiving these\r\n  benefits.Â  Whether or not he was required to report them as income for income\r\n  tax purposes, they inured to his advantage and were properly considered as\r\n  income for purposes of setting child support.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(2) (Supp. 2006) (stating\r\n  that, in determination of child support awards, â€œ[u]nreported case income\r\n  should also be included if it can be identified.â€); id. 114-4720(A)(3)(C) (noting that, although in-kind income is not included in\r\n  gross income for determining child support, â€œthe court should count as income\r\n  expense reimbursements or in-kind payments received by a parent from . . .\r\n  operation of a business if they are significant and reduce personal living\r\n  expenses . . . .â€); Mobley v. Mobley, 309 S.C. 134, 138-39, 420 S.E.2d\r\n  506, 509-10 (Ct. App. 1992) (holding the custodial parent was entitled to a\r\n  redetermination of a child support award because the family court failed to\r\n  include in the noncustodial parentâ€™s income any amount for his employee\r\n  benefits).\r\nHusband\r\n  further takes issue with the inclusion of rental income on one of his\r\n  tractor-trailer trucks in his monthly income, alleging the payments he was\r\n  receiving were simply used to make the loan payments on the vehicles and the\r\n  payments did not come in on a regular basis.Â  We find no abuse of discretion.Â \r\n  The family court noted (1) the amount reflecting this income actually covered\r\n  the rental of only one of two trucks; and (2) Husband had listed this amount on\r\n  his initial financial declaration, but omitted it from his later financial\r\n  statement.Â  In our view, the family courtâ€™s inclusion of rental income for only\r\n  one tractor-trailer truck was a reasonable compromise offsetting the sporadic\r\n  receipt of the payments and any expenses associated with the trucks.\r\nApplying\r\n  the revised figure for Husbandâ€™s monthly base income, Husbandâ€™s child support\r\n  payments under the South Carolina Child Support Guidelines should be $1,408.00\r\n  per month, rather than $1,484.00 per month as ordered by the family court.Â  We\r\n  therefore modify the appealed order to reflect this finding.  \r\n2.Â  Husband next\r\n  argues the family court erred in requiring him to pay $550.00 per month for the\r\n  younger childâ€™s expenses at a Montessori school.Â  In support of this argument,\r\n  he asserts (1) this payment was not included in the partiesâ€™ agreement; (2) the\r\n  amount was placed into the child support calculation twice and treated as a\r\n  twelve-month expense when it was actually a nine-month expense; (3) it was\r\n  inequitable to require him to pay these expenses because Wife is entitled to\r\n  claim these same expenses as daycare; and (4) he should have been given credit\r\n  for paying expenses associated with the older childâ€™s participation in athletics.Â \r\n  We find no reversible error.\r\nAlthough\r\n  the payment of the younger childâ€™s Montessori school expenses was not part of\r\n  the partiesâ€™ agreement, Wife testified she desired Husband to assist with these\r\n  expenses, of which she herself was ordered to pay a proportionate share, plus the\r\n  fee for two to three weeks of summer camp for the younger child.Â  Furthermore, as\r\n  shown on line 10 of the child support worksheet used by the family court,\r\n  Husband was given a credit of $550.00 as an adjustment to his child support\r\n  obligation. Â As to Husbandâ€™s final argument, he has neither directed our\r\n  attention to evidence in the record upon which the family court should have\r\n  based an appropriate adjustment to his child support payments based on his\r\n  contributions toward expenses incurred by the older child nor cited any\r\n  supporting authority for his assertion that he was entitled to such a credit.Â  See First\r\n    Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (stating the appellant was deemed to have abandoned an issue for which he\r\n  failed to provide any argument or supporting authority).\r\n3.Â  Husband next\r\n  argues he should not have to pay alimony and child support through the clerk of\r\n  court, arguing he incurs additional costs of $3,984.00 per year in court fees.Â \r\n  He suggests he should be allowed to set up an automatic draft from his bank\r\n  account to pay alimony and child support directly to Wifeâ€™s bank account.Â  We\r\n  find no abuse of discretion in the family courtâ€™s refusal to let him make his\r\n  own arrangements for these payments.Â  At the initial temporary hearing, the\r\n  family court allowed him to pay child support directly to Wife; however, he\r\n  failed to make payments as ordered, which necessitated an additional hearing to\r\n  require him to make his payments through the court.\r\n4.Â  Husband complains the\r\n  family court overvalued his State Farm account because he did not invest the\r\n  funds in an individual retirement account and because he would not receive\r\n  whatever benefits he was entitled to until he reached age 55 or 60, provided he\r\n  had worked 20 years.Â  On appeal, he contends that, instead of the figure of\r\n  $78,069.00 that appears on Wifeâ€™s asset list as the value of this account, the\r\n  account should have been assigned a present value of $15,000.00.Â  Wife has not\r\n  provided any counterargument on this point in her brief; therefore, we modify\r\n  the appealed order to find that the value of the State Farm residual account\r\n  awarded to Husband is $15,000.00.\r\n5.Â \r\n  Husband further alleges Wifeâ€™s half-interest in a house that she purchased with\r\n  her father during the marriage should have been included in the marital\r\n  estate.Â  We disagree.Â  The fact that the property was acquired during the\r\n  marriage raises only a presumption that it is marital.Â  See Fuller v.\r\n    Fuller, 370 S.C. 538, 551, 636 S.E.2d 636, 643 (Ct. App. 2006) (â€œBecause of the general presumption\r\n  that property acquired during the marriage is an asset of the marriage, the\r\n  burden to show an asset is nonmarital is\r\n  upon the party claiming the nonmarital status.â€).Â  Here, the family court apparently determined Wife\r\n  carried her burden to show the interest was not marital, and the evidence\r\n  supports this finding.Â  Wife testified her father resided in the house,\r\n  intended to stay there indefinitely, and was responsible for the expenses\r\n  associated with it.Â  She also indicated her name was on the title only because\r\n  she co-signed the loan to purchase the home.\r\n6.Â  Notwithstanding our adjustment of the value of Husbandâ€™s State\r\n  Farm residual account, we affirm the family courtâ€™s division of the remaining\r\n  marital assets and debt.Â   \r\nAt the outset, we note the family court\r\n  did not, as required by statute, â€œmake findings of fact from credible evidence\r\n  of the value of property and servicesâ€ before allocating the marital assets and\r\n  debt.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-474(1) (Supp. 2006).Â  Instead, the court\r\n  apparently did not attempt to value the marital assets either individually or\r\n  collectively, but instead divided the marital property in-kind based on how a\r\n  particular item was titled or testimony from the parties regarding who should\r\n  receive it.Â  Accordingly, Wife received the marital home and furnishings, her\r\n  2004 Chevrolet Tahoe, various American Express accounts, and her State retirement\r\n  and 401k accounts. Â Similarly, Husband received his interest in certain\r\n  commercial properties, the residual value of his State Farm account, and all\r\n  other vehicles.Â  As to debts incurred during the marriage, the family court\r\n  required Husband to be responsible for a federal tax lien of $62,854.20 that\r\n  attached to the marital home as a result of his failure to file tax returns and\r\n  pay taxes for 2002, 2003, and 2004.\r\nAccording to the inventory of marital property submitted\r\n  by Wife, as amended by the revised value of the State Farm residual account, she\r\n  received assets totaling $180,391.03 and Husband received assets totaling $151,876.00;\r\n  therefore, the total value of the divided assets according to Wife was $332,267.03.Â \r\n  In contrast, Husband submitted an inventory valuing the marital assets Wife\r\n  received at $200,391.44[2] and those he received at $135,876.00[3];\r\n  thus, the combined value of the assets using Husbandâ€™s valuation was $336,267.44.Â \r\n  Under the evidence presented to the family court, Wifeâ€™s share of the marital\r\n  estate, then, ranges from 54.29 percent to 59.59 percent.Â  Similarly, Husbandâ€™s\r\n  share ranges from 40.41 percent to 45.71 percent.Â  We hold the division is reasonable under the\r\n  circumstances of this case, which include the family courtâ€™s recognition that\r\n  the marital estate was â€œsomewhat difficult to value due to the husbandâ€™s\r\n  evasive answers and obvious attempts not to disclose assets and income.â€ \r\n \r\n7.Â  Husband further contends\r\n  that, because the tax lien was incurred before the commencement of the marital\r\n  litigation, the family court should not have made him solely responsible for\r\n  discharging it.Â  Although Husband cites case law supporting his argument that\r\n  the lien was a marital debt and argues at length about the hardship he would\r\n  suffer from having to pay it, he does not contest the family courtâ€™s findings\r\n  that the obligation resulted from his refusal and failure to timely file tax\r\n  returns and pay taxes and that Wife had been filing her tax returns and paying\r\n  her taxes after she became aware Husband was avoiding his tax obligations.[4]Â \r\n  Under these circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion in the family courtâ€™s\r\n  decision to assign Husband responsibility for the lien.Â  See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-7-472(2) (Supp. 2006) (requiring the family court, in apportioning\r\n  the marital estate, to give appropriate weight to â€œmarital misconduct or fault\r\n  of either or both parties, whether or not used as a basis for a divorce as\r\n  such, if the misconduct affects or has affected the economic circumstances of\r\n  the partiesâ€); Woodside v. Woodside, 290 S.C. 366, 374, 350 S.E.2d 407,\r\n  412 (Ct. App. 1986) (â€œ[T]he conduct factor becomes important in equitable\r\n  distribution when the conduct of one party to the marriage is such that it\r\n  throws upon the other party marital burdens beyond the norms to be expected in\r\n  the marital relationship.â€). Â \r\n8. Â Husband next argues the\r\n  alimony award was excessive in that it placed Wife in better circumstances than\r\n  she enjoyed during the marriage.Â  In support of this argument, he asserts Wife\r\n  is young, well educated, gainfully employed, and in good health.Â  He also\r\n  points to the fact that, after the divorce, she retained considerable\r\n  nonmarital property and had generous retirement accounts and benefits as a\r\n  state employee.Â  We find no error.\r\nIn the appealed\r\n  order, the family court gave full consideration to the statutory factors on\r\n  which to base an alimony award.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(c) (Supp.\r\n  2006).Â  Significantly, the court noted (1) the parties had been married fifteen\r\n  years; (2) Husband earned far more than Wife; (3) Husbandâ€™s misconduct caused\r\n  the breakup of the marriage; (4) during the marriage Wife enjoyed a fine\r\n  lifestyle that included a home in an upscale neighborhood and trips to exotic\r\n  locations; (5) Husband would receive a tax benefit because he could deduct the\r\n  alimony payments; and (6) neither party had any support obligations from a prior\r\n  marriage.Â  Considering these findings, as well as the considerable difficulties\r\n  in ascertaining Husbandâ€™s income, we disagree with Husband that the family\r\n  court abused its discretion in determining the alimony award.Â  See Craig v. Craig, 365 S.C. 285, 292, 617 S.E.2d 359, 362\r\n  (2005) (â€œAn award of alimony rests within the sound discretion of the family\r\n  court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.â€).\r\n9.Â  Husband further contends\r\n  the award of retroactive alimony was excessive, especially given that he paid\r\n  one half of the mortgage payments on the marital home while the action was\r\n  pending.Â  We disagree.Â  Wife had requested alimony at the temporary hearing,\r\n  and Husband had notice from the first temporary order that the issue of alimony\r\n  would be decided at the final hearing but was subject to retroactive\r\n  application.Â  In determining retroactive alimony, the family court evidently\r\n  relied on the same factors that it considered in determining periodic alimony.Â \r\n  As to Husbandâ€™s argument that he should receive a credit toward the retroactive\r\n  alimony award for the payments he made on the mortgage on the marital home, we\r\n  agree with Wife that these payments, which Wife was required to make as well,\r\n  were ordered with the objective of preserving a marital asset rather than to\r\n  provide support and maintenance.\r\n10.Â  Husband next argues the family court erred in granting Wife a\r\n  divorce based on adultery, asserting Wifeâ€™s testimony alone was insufficient\r\n  evidence to support a finding that he had been unfaithful.Â  He further contends\r\n  that any reliance on Wifeâ€™s testimony that he had infected her\r\n  with Chlamydia was improper because the parties reconciled after that\r\n  occurrence.Â   \r\nWe\r\n  have some concern as to whether the evidence Wife offered to support her claim\r\n  for a divorce on the ground of adultery was sufficient.Â  See McElveen\r\n    v. McElveen, 332 S.C. 583, 596-97, 506 S.E.2d 1, 7-8 (1998) (affirming the\r\n  family courtâ€™s refusal to find a party had committed adultery, notwithstanding\r\n  numerous telephone calls between the party and her alleged paramour during late\r\n  hours, records of weekend trips taken by the party and her alleged paramour,\r\n  and evidence of attempts to alter or eradicate these records).Â  In any event, we\r\n  note the family court, with Wifeâ€™s consent, granted Husbandâ€™s request to amend\r\n  his pleadings to request a divorce on the ground of a one-year separation.Â  Because\r\n  there was evidence that the parties had been separated at least one year before\r\n  the final hearing, we affirm the grant of a divorce, but modify the decision to\r\n  hold this relief is based on a one-year separation.\r\n11.Â  Finally, Husband\r\n  contends the award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife was excessive, especially\r\n  considering that she had allegedly been uncooperative regarding his contact\r\n  with the children and her behavior necessitated a second temporary hearing and\r\n  the appointment of a guardian ad litem.Â  We disagree.Â  In our view, the family court adequately considered the requisite\r\n  factors under Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313,\r\n  315 (1991), in determining the amount to award Wife as attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  In\r\n  particular, we note Husbandâ€™s refusal to reveal his income and assets prolonged\r\n  the resolution of the issues on the case, causing Wife to incur legal expenses\r\n  that would not have been necessary but for Husbandâ€™s failure to cooperate.Â  As\r\n  to Wifeâ€™s alleged interference with visitation, we hold the evidence shows she\r\n  did not intend to prevent Husband from having a meaningful\r\n  relationship with his children, but was concerned that their sonâ€™s\r\n  participation in school and church was declining because of his athletic\r\n  pursuits. Â Finally, we note that Wife was the prevailing party on most of the\r\n  issues in this action.Â  We therefore uphold the award of attorneyâ€™s fees to\r\n  Wife.\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nHEARN, C.J.,\r\n  KITTREDGE and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  In valuing the marital residence, Husband subtracted\r\n  the amount of a tax lien that the family court ordered him to pay; however, the\r\n  figure we have given here does not reflect this debt.\r\n[3]Â  In his inventory, Husband indicated the State Farm\r\n  residual account had a zero value and the total value of Husbandâ€™s assets, as\r\n  submitted by Husband, has been amended in this opinion to reflect that the\r\n  State Farm account has a value of $15,000.00.\r\n[4]Â  It appears from the returns included in the record\r\n  on appeal that Husband had returns professionally prepared for the years in\r\n  question; however, the date of tax preparerâ€™s signature on the returns for 2002\r\n  and 2003 is March 6, 2006, just shortly before the final hearing.Â  There is no\r\n  signature at all on the return for 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-539","title":"Covington v.

Covington, Jr., of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This\r\n  is an action filed by Respondents Susan B. Covington, Alan R. Cochran, and\r\n  Kathy H. Cochran, to determine the extent of their rights to use a road\r\n  traversing several tracts of privately owned property.Â  Defendants Alexander and Alexandria Karter, as\r\n  Trustees of the Karter Living Trust dated 4/17/00; and Neil R., Janet E., and Gary\r\n  Blesi (collectively â€œAppellantsâ€), all of whom were among the owners of the\r\n  servient estates, appeal the trial courtâ€™s finding that their properties were\r\n  subject to an easement and the courtâ€™s determination of the scope of the\r\n  easement.Â  We affirm as modified.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn January 5, 1899, Wilt T. Meares\r\n  purchased approximately 350 acres of land in Oconee County (the Meares\r\n  Property).Â  On December 8, 1909, Meares deeded the northern portion of\r\n  the land to his daughter, Ella Kestler (the Kestler Tract).Â  Appellantsâ€™\r\n  chain of title originates in the Kestler Tract.\r\nThe Kestler Tract was bounded by Oconee Station Road, a public\r\n  road, now known as Biggerstaff Road.Â  Wilt resided on the remaining portion\r\n  of the Meares Property, which was not bounded by any public road, and used a\r\n  road known as Meares Drive, which ran through the Kestler Tract, for ingress\r\n  and egress between his property and Oconee Station Road. \r\nIn 1931,\r\n  the portion of the Meares Property on which Wilt had been living was deeded to another\r\n  of his daughters, Lena Cochran, who began residing in Wiltâ€™s former home (the Cochran\r\n  Tract).Â  In the late 1960s, Duke Power Energy Corporation purchased a\r\n  significant portion of the Cochran Tract, in addition to other property, to\r\n  create Lake Keowee.Â  Because Lenaâ€™s home was located within the property sold\r\n  to Duke Power, she built another home on the Cochran Tract.Â  Lenaâ€™s grandson, Richard Meares, currently lives in the house she built.Â  Another grandson,\r\n  Virgil Meares, lives on and owns another portion of the Cochran Tract.Â  The\r\n  remainder of the Cochran Tract is now owned by Respondents and other Cochran\r\n  relatives. Â \r\nAs\r\n  evidenced by witness testimony and public records, Meares Drive has existed in\r\n  its present location for at least the past seventy-five years.Â  Previously, the\r\n  road had drainage ditches on both sides; however, these have since washed out.Â \r\n  In the early 1980s, the Karters installed railroad ties and planted shrubbery\r\n  on their property in the ditch lines, thus narrowing the width of the road;\r\n  however, other parts of Meares Drive were at least twenty feet wide.Â  It\r\n  appears undisputed that, but for Meares Drive, the Cochran tract, on which a\r\n  church once stood, would be landlocked.  \r\nOn April 25, 2005, Respondents filed this\r\n  action against Appellants and others asserting\r\n  they were entitled to a twenty-foot-wide express easement, easement implied by\r\n  prior use, easement by prescription, and easement by necessity.Â  The other\r\n  defendants besides Appellants agreed to deed Respondents a twenty-foot-wide\r\n  easement with rights of improvement over their respective lots.  \r\nAt trial, Appellants conceded the\r\n  existence of an easement.Â  The trial court found Respondents had an\r\n  easement based on the following grounds: Â (1) by grant or reservation; (2)\r\n  implied by necessity; (3) implied by pre-existing use; and (4) by prescription.\r\nThe trial court found the width of the easement to be twenty\r\n  feet.Â  In support of this finding, the court noted the following: Â (1) the road\r\n  is twenty feet wide for over seventy-five percent of its length; (2)\r\n  Appellantsâ€™ lots are not contiguous; therefore, the width of the road would\r\n  change numerous times if the road were not of uniform width; (3) a twenty-foot-wide\r\n  road would be sufficient to accommodate two-way traffic; (4) the width of Meares\r\n  Drive has been at least twenty feet since the 1960s, with the only evidence of\r\n  any narrowing being landscape timbers placed by the Karters in the ditch; and (5)\r\n  there was testimony that at one point the road was wide enough to accommodate\r\n  the transportation of a twenty-four-foot-wide mobile home. \r\nThe trial court further found it was\r\n  reasonable and necessary to the proper enjoyment of the easement that the surface\r\n  of the road conform to that of other roads in the community.Â  In support\r\n  of this finding, the trial court stated that â€œ[a]ll of the exhibits introduced\r\n  indicated that paved roads are prevalent in this residential portion of the\r\n  community.â€Â  The court also found it could â€œtake judicial notice that\r\n  the reasonable standard for a vehicular road in the 21st Century is pavement\r\n  rather than dirt.â€Â  As to any contention that paving the road would\r\n  affect Appellantsâ€™ use of their properties, the trial court found the easement would\r\n  still be used consistent with the purpose and character of the easement and\r\n  granted Respondents â€œreasonable and necessary improvement rights in the\r\n  easement which shall include paving and grading.â€[2]Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe determination of whether an easement exists is a\r\n  question of fact in a law case subject to an â€œany evidenceâ€ standard of\r\n  review.Â  Slear v. Hanna, 329 S.C. 407, 410, 496 S.E.2d 633, 635 (1998).Â  The determination of the scope\r\n  of the easement, however, is a question in equity.Â  Hardy v. Aiken,&nbsp;369\r\n  S.C. 160, 165, 631 S.E.2d 539, 541&nbsp;(2006).Â   \r\nIn an equity action,\r\n  an appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its views\r\n  of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Grosshuesch v. Cramer, 367 S.C.\r\n  1, 4, 623 S.E.2d 833, 834&nbsp;(2005).Â  Thus, this Court may reverse a factual\r\n  finding by the trial court when the appellant satisfies us the finding is\r\n  against the greater weight of the evidence.Â  Campbell v. Carr,\r\n  361 S.C. 258, 263, 603 S.E.2d 625, 627&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  Pursuant to Rule\r\n  220(b), SCACR, â€œwhen an appellate court chooses to find facts in accordance\r\n  with its own view of the evidence, the court must state distinctly its findings\r\n  of fact and the reason for its decision.â€Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351\r\n  S.C. 278, 283, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369&nbsp;(2002).\r\nMoreover, the broad\r\n  scope of review in an equity case does not require an appellate court to\r\n  disregard the findings of the trial court.Â  Id.; Robinson v. Tyson,\r\n  319 S.C. 360, 362-63, 461 S.E.2d 397, 399&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995).Â  Furthermore, an\r\n  appellant is not relieved of the burden of convincing the appellate court that\r\n  that the trial courtâ€™s findings were in error.Â  Pinckney v. Warren, 344\r\n  S.C. 382, 387-88, 544 S.E.2d 620, 623&nbsp;(2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â \r\n  Appellants first argue the trial court erred in finding Respondents are\r\n  entitled to either a prescriptive easement or an easement by necessity.Â  We find\r\n  no reversible error.[3]\r\nIn\r\n  their brief, Appellants conceded the existence of an easement by prescription\r\n  or necessity in the argument section of their brief.[4]Â \r\n  Moreover, they did not appeal the trial courtâ€™s finding that Respondents have\r\n  an express easement or an implied easement by prior use.[5]Â  â€œA ruling not challenged on appeal is the law of the\r\n  case, regardless of the correctness of the ruling.â€Â  S.C. Coastal\r\n    Conservation League v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 363 S.C.\r\n  67, 76, 610 S.E.2d 482, 487&nbsp;(2005).Â  Accordingly, the finding that\r\n  Respondents had an easement by necessity over Appellantsâ€™ land, and\r\n  alternatively an easement by grant, an easement implied by prior use, or an\r\n  easement by prescription is the law of the case.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  any event, we hold the evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s finding that\r\n  Respondents established their right to an easement by necessity over\r\n  Appellantsâ€™ land.Â  Both the dominant and servient estates were acquired as a\r\n  single tract by Wilt Meares, who subsequently deeded the Kestler tract to his\r\n  daughter, and there appears to be no dispute that Meares Drive was the\r\n  only way to access the property from the public street at the time of this\r\n  conveyance and, for that matter, remains so today.Â  See Kennedy v.\r\n    Bedenbaugh, 352 S.C. 56, 60, 572 S.E.2d 452, 454 (2002) (stating the legal\r\n  requirements of an easement by necessity are unity of title, severance of\r\n  title, and necessity).Â   \r\n2.Â  Appellants\r\n  next assert the trial court erred in finding Respondents could â€œwidenâ€ the\r\n  easement to twenty feet.Â  We find no error.\r\nContrary to Appellantsâ€™ contention in their brief, the\r\n  trial court did not permit Respondents to expand the width of Meares Road; rather, the court found the width of the easement to be twenty feet.Â  The\r\n  record has evidence to support this finding.  \r\nVirgil Meares testified that when he was preparing to move a mobile home onto his\r\n  property, he measured Meares Drive Â and determined the road was at least\r\n  twenty feet wide from ditch to ditch.Â  In addition, Virgil testified that his\r\n  father, who had also lived on the Cochran Tract, had routinely cleared the\r\n  ditches that ran alongside Meares Drive to prevent water from draining over the\r\n  road.Â  Virgil further estimated the road was â€œfrom ditch to ditch . . .\r\n  probably 22 feet.â€Â  He also stated that, since his fatherâ€™s death, the ditches\r\n  had been washed over with rain and as a result are filled in.Â   \r\nVirgil\r\n  also testified that the location where Meares Drive traverses his property and\r\n  his brothersâ€™ and sistersâ€™ property, the road is twenty feet wide.Â  He believed\r\n  that portion of the road was around one thousand feet in length.Â  He also\r\n  noted that his information was based on a survey of his motherâ€™s property that\r\n  he requested when he administered her estate.  \r\nBased\r\n  on this evidence, we uphold the trial courtâ€™s finding that the width of the\r\n  easement is twenty feet.Â  See Moore v. Reynolds, 285 S.C.\r\n  574, 578, 330 S.E.2d 542, 545&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1985) (â€œ[W]here a deed grants a\r\n  right of way but does not fix its width, a determination of the width of the\r\n  easement becomes a matter of construction of the instrument with strong\r\n  consideration being given to what is reasonable, convenient and necessary to\r\n  accomplish the purpose for which the right-of-way was created.â€); Marlow v. Marlow, 284 S.C. 155, 161, 325 S.E.2d 703, 707\r\n  (Ct. App. 1984) (holding a twenty-foot-wide road was sufficient to accommodate\r\n  two-way automobile traffic and enable the owner of the dominant estate to\r\n  access her land); 12 S.C. Jur. Easements Â§ 22 (1992) (â€œThere do not appear to be any South Carolina cases concerning the\r\n  width of an easement by necessity, but presumably a court would look to what is\r\n  reasonable and necessary.â€).[6] \r\n \r\n3.Â  Finally,\r\n  Appellants argue the trial court erred in allowing Respondents to pave and\r\n  grade Meares Drive.Â  Although we affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision to allow\r\n  Respondents to grade the road, we agree with Appellantsâ€™ challenge to the\r\n  courtâ€™s permission to pave it.\r\nâ€œ[T]he holder of an easement\r\n  . . . is entitled to use the servient estate in a manner that is reasonably\r\n  necessary for the convenient enjoyment of the servitude.Â  The manner,\r\n  frequency, and intensity of the use may change over time to take advantage of\r\n  developments in technology and to accommodate normal development of the\r\n  dominant estate or enterprise benefited by the servitude.â€Â  Restatement\r\n    (Third) of Property Â§ 4.10 (2000).Â   \r\nThe\r\n  trial court found Meares Road was initially a dirt road that descendants of\r\n  Wilt Meares had maintained by grading and application of gravel.Â  Noting\r\n  Respondents desired to improve the road for â€œcurrent day travelâ€ by paving it,\r\n  the trial court found the request was â€œreasonable and necessary to the proper\r\n  enjoyment of the easement that the surface of the road conform[ ] to other road\r\n  standards in the community.â€Â  The trial court supported its decision by taking\r\n  â€œjudicial noticeâ€ that paved roads, rather than dirt roads, are the present day\r\n  norm.\r\nWe\r\n  find this reasoning flawed for several reasons.Â  First, although the trial\r\n  court may be correct that paved roads are more common than dirt roads, the road\r\n  at issue here presently has a gravel surface.Â  More important, however, is the\r\n  absence of any evidence that a graded gravel road has not provided Respondents\r\n  â€œconvenient enjoymentâ€ of their right-of-way over Meares Drive.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  the record is devoid of evidence suggesting the dominant estates have developed\r\n  commercially or otherwise to the extent that vehicular traffic over a gravel\r\n  surface has become unfeasible.Â  Indeed, as the trial court noted, Respondents\r\n  own only 4.6 acres out of the 350-acre estate that Wilt Meares acquired in\r\n  1899.\r\nWe therefore modify the trial courtâ€™s ruling regarding\r\n  improvement of the easement to hold that, although Respondents may continue to\r\n  grade Meares Drive at their own expense, they may not pave the road.\r\n4.Â  Finally,\r\n  Appellants assert Respondents, as remote grantees, should not be allowed to\r\n  expand the use of an easement of limited use to that of unlimited use.Â  We\r\n  decline to address this argument.Â  The\r\n  trial court did not rule on this issue, and Appellants did not move under Rule\r\n  59(e), SCRCP, to address this omission; therefore, this issue is not preserved\r\n  for our review.Â  See In\r\n  re Michael H., 360 S.C. 540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729, 732 (2004) (â€œAn issue may not be raised for the first time on appeal.Â  In order\r\n  to preserve an issue for appeal, it must be raised to and ruled upon by the\r\n  trial court.â€); Lucas v. Rawl Family\r\n    Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505,\r\n  510-11, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004) (â€œIt is well settled\r\n  that, but for a very few exceptional circumstances, an appellate court cannot\r\n  address an issue unless it was raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.â€).\r\nAFFIRMED AS\r\n  MODIFIED.\r\nHEARN, C.J.,\r\n  KITTREDGE and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  The trial court acknowledged that â€œthe Karters could\r\n  complain that their landscape timbers could be dislodged by the improvement of\r\n  the road,â€ and, as a solution to this problem, ordered Respondents to take\r\n  responsibility for replacing the trees and any other planted vegetation after\r\n  paving the road.\r\n[3]Â  Respondents assert numerous preservation\r\n  concerns with Appellantsâ€™ brief.Â  Many of those concerns revolve around\r\n  Respondentsâ€™ contention Appellantsâ€™ arguments are not listed in their statement of issues on appeal.Â  See State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 694 (2003) (â€œNo point will be considered which is not set forth in the\r\n  statement of issues on appeal.â€) (citing Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR).Â  In our view, Appellantsâ€™ arguments\r\n  were all sufficiently contained in the issues on appeal.Â  Nevertheless, although\r\n  Appellants listed the issue of the existence of an easement in their statement\r\n  of issues on appeal, they failed to address it in the argument section of their\r\n  brief; therefore, we decline to address it.Â  See Fields v.\r\n    Melrose Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 312 S.C. 102, 106,\r\n  439 S.E.2d 283, 284 (Ct. App. 1993) (â€œAn issue raised on\r\n  appeal but not argued in the brief is deemed abandoned and will not be\r\n  considered by the appellate court.â€).Â   \r\n[4]Â  Specifically, Appellants made the following\r\n  statement in their brief: Â â€œIt is admitted that the dirt road leading from\r\n  Biggerstaff Road to the Meares home . . . existed either as a prescriptive\r\n  easement or as an easement by necessity to the Meares property.â€  \r\n[5] Â We are aware of the apparent inconsistency within\r\n  the appealed order concerning the findings by the trial court that Respondents\r\n  had both a prescriptive easement and an easement by grant or reservation.Â  See 12 S.C. Jur. Easements Â§ 10 (1992) (â€œA prescriptive easement is\r\n  analogous to adverse possession.Â  A prescriptive easement arises not from an\r\n  express grant or reservation or by implication, but is established by conduct\r\n  of the owner of the dominant tenement contrary to the fee simple interest of\r\n  the owner of the servient tenement.â€).Â  We reconcile this\r\n  apparent contradiction by noting the order concludes that Respondents â€œare\r\n  hereby granted an appurtenant easement by necessity or alternatively an\r\n  easement by grant or reservation, implied by pre-existing use, or by\r\n  prescription, in the road over [Appellantsâ€™] property known as Meares Drive.â€ (emphasis added).\r\n \r\n[6]Â  Appellants also question the trial courtâ€™s statement\r\n  that â€œThere is testimony that the road at one point was wide enough to\r\n  accommodate the transportation of a 24 foot wide trailer by Virgil Meares,â€ noting\r\n  the trailer came in two fourteen-foot sections.Â  Even if, as Appellants seem to\r\n  contend, the evidence is suspect, we hold there is sufficient evidence\r\n  otherwise to support the finding that the width of the easement is twenty feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-540","title":"State v.

Â§ 16-9-340.[1]Â \r\n  He appeals, asserting the trial court erred in admitting inadmissible hearsay\r\n  evidence from one witness to bolster the testimony of another witness, which\r\n  was the basis of the prosecution.Â  We affirm.[2]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThis\r\n  case arose from a telephone conversation between Thompson and Chief Sam White,\r\n  the Chief of Public Safety for the City of Union.Â  Chief White testified that\r\n  around three-thirty in the afternoon on Tuesday, March 15, 2005, he returned to\r\n  his office and found a voice mail message had been left for him by Thompson\r\n  telling the Chief who he was and leaving a phone number.Â  Chief White had known\r\n  Thompson about twenty-five years and recognized his voice on the message.Â  \r\n \r\nChief\r\n  White called the number and spoke with Thompson, who asked if the Chief was\r\n  aware of Thompsonâ€™s daughterâ€™s situation.Â  The Chief told Thompson he knew\r\n  Thompsonâ€™s daughter had been in court that day, but he was unaware of the\r\n  sentence she received.Â  Thompson relayed he was upset because his daughter was\r\n  just a drug user, not a seller, but that the people who were selling drugs\r\n  never were caught.Â  Chief White talked with Thompson some about his daughterâ€™s\r\n  case, after which Thompson made the statement that he had been in the military\r\n  for thirty-eight years, and told the Chief that he was trained as a sniper.Â \r\n  Thompson discussed that the police did not catch the pushers, but only the\r\n  users of drugs, and that he knew where they were and he was going to take care\r\n  of them.Â  Thompson brought up his military training and asked the Chief if he\r\n  knew what it meant that people referred to him as â€œone-shot.â€Â  Chief White told\r\n  Thompson he could not take the law into his hands and shoot someone.Â \r\n  Thereafter, the focus of Thompsonâ€™s conversation changed from the drug\r\n  dealers.Â  Thompson told Chief White that if they were having court the next\r\n  day, â€œit would be best if [Chief White] didnâ€™t go.â€Â  The Chief asked Thompson\r\n  what he was talking about and Thompson replied that â€œwhat happened in Atlanta\r\n  will look like a picnic,â€ and he was â€œtelling [Chief White] as a friend,â€ that\r\n  if they were having court the next day it would be best if the Chief did not\r\n  attend.Â  Chief White explained that several court personnel had been killed in\r\n  an Atlanta courtroom that previous Friday.Â  Toward the end of the conversation,\r\n  Thompson told the Chief, â€œIâ€™m telling you as a friend, donâ€™t go to court\r\n  tomorrow if they have it,â€ and he then hung up the phone.Â   \r\nChief\r\n  White testified Thompson sounded as if he had been drinking, and seemed\r\n  irritated and upset.Â  Knowing that Thompson was a gun dealer, Chief White\r\n  feared for the safety of people at the courthouse.Â  After dropping off some\r\n  money at City Hall, the Chief went to the Sheriffâ€™s Office and told Sheriff\r\n  Howard Wells about the conversation he had with Thompson.Â   \r\nSheriff\r\n  Wells testified that he is responsible for, among other things, security of the\r\n  Union County Courthouse.Â  General Sessions Court was being held there the week\r\n  of March 14, 2005, with Judge Westbrook presiding.Â  On Tuesday of that week,\r\n  the court was taking guilty pleas and, after a break for lunch, bond hearings\r\n  and more guilty pleas were scheduled.Â  Shortly after 4:00 p.m., as court was\r\n  proceeding with these matters, Chief White came to Sheriff Wellsâ€™ office.Â  The\r\n  Sheriff testified, â€œAround four, four ten on the afternoon of Tuesday, March\r\n  the 15th, Sam White the Public Safety Chief came to my office and\r\n  told me that he had had a disturbing telephone call --.â€Â  Defense counsel then\r\n  stated, â€œObjection, your Honor, as to hearsay.â€Â  The trial court overruled the\r\n  objection, stating simply, â€œIâ€™m going to allow it.Â  Thank you very much.Â \r\n  Please proceed.â€Â  Sheriff Wells then testified that Chief White came to his\r\n  office around 4:10 p.m. and informed him he had received a call from Thompson,\r\n  which Chief White returned.Â  Sheriff Wells stated, â€œThe substance of that\r\n  telephone conversation gave him some concern and he was relating to me what had\r\n  been said.â€Â  The solicitor then asked whether the â€œsubject of the conversation\r\n  was . . . reflected in the Chiefâ€™s testimonyâ€ that he had just heard.Â  The\r\n  Sheriff responded, â€œThatâ€™s correct.â€Â   \r\nThe\r\n  Sheriff then went on to testify to the steps he took to ensure the security for\r\n  the Courthouse Complex as a result of Chief Whiteâ€™s report.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Sheriff Wells informed Judge Westbrook of the threat directed toward the\r\n  court.Â  His office obtained a warrant against Thompson, and put a plan in\r\n  action to neutralize the threat.Â  If Thompson could be located and taken into custody\r\n  in time, court would proceed the next day.Â  If, however, they were unable to\r\n  timely take Thompson into custody, he would notify Judge Westbrook and the\r\n  courthouse would be shut down the following day.Â   \r\nThompson\r\n  was subsequently located, taken into custody, and booked into the jail around\r\n  6:20 that evening.Â  However, the Sheriff testified they were still on\r\n  heightened alert that next day, and because of Thompsonâ€™s actions, the court\r\n  effectively shut down the afternoon of the phone call, with no other matters\r\n  being handled by the court that day.Â  Further, because Judge Westbrook was the\r\n  sentencing judge in the case of Thompsonâ€™s daughter, they provided security for\r\n  the judge, and he and his law clerk did not leave Union County until Judge\r\n  Westbrook was notified that Thompson was in custody.Â   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Thompson contends the trial court erred in permitting inadmissible\r\n  hearsay testimony by Sheriff Wells to bolster Chief Whiteâ€™s testimony about\r\n  Thompsonâ€™s statements, these statements being the basis of Thompsonâ€™s\r\n  prosecution.Â  Thompson argues the testimony by Sheriff Wells, that Chief White\r\n  relayed the same information to him that Chief White testified to at trial,\r\n  constituted an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter\r\n  asserted which is prohibited by Rule 801, SCRE.Â  Thompson further maintains\r\n  these statements constituted a prior consistent statement which did not qualify\r\n  as non-hearsay pursuant to Rule 801(d)(1)(B), SCRE.Â  Thompson asserts the\r\n  admission of the improper bolstering testimony was prejudicial because it\r\n  allowed the jury to hear two witnesses against him.\r\nWe\r\n  first note that Thompson never raised below the specific arguments he makes on\r\n  appeal.Â  He never argued to the trial court that Sheriff Wellsâ€™ testimony\r\n  bolstered Chief Whiteâ€™s testimony, nor did he assert that the testimony of\r\n  Sheriff Wells constituted a prior consistent statement that was inadmissible\r\n  under the rules.Â  Thus, these arguments are not preserved for review.Â  See State v. Johnson, 363 S.C. 53, 58-59, 609 S.E.2d 520, 523 (2005) (To\r\n  preserve an issue for appellate review there must be a contemporaneous\r\n  objection that is ruled upon by the trial court and the objection should be\r\n  addressed to the trial court in a sufficiently specific manner that brings\r\n  attention to the exact error.Â  If a party fails to properly object, he is\r\n  procedurally barred from raising the issue on appeal.); State v. Dunbar,\r\n  356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 694 (2003) (A party need not use the exact\r\n  name of a legal doctrine in order to preserve it, but it must be clear that the\r\n  argument has been presented on that ground.).\r\nTurning\r\n  to the specific objection Thompson did make, which was the simple statement of\r\n  â€œhearsay,â€ it is notable that the objection was made prior to Sheriff Wellsâ€™\r\n  testimony regarding the content of Chief Whiteâ€™s statement.Â  The Sheriff\r\n  testified Chief White reported to him â€œHe had a disturbing telephone call,â€ at\r\n  which point defense counsel objected and the court overruled the objection.Â \r\n  When the Sheriff continued his answer, he explained that the telephone\r\n  conversation was with Thompson, the substance of the conversation gave Chief\r\n  White some concern and that the Chief related to the Sheriff what had been\r\n  said.Â  Sheriff Wells did not, at that point, testify as to what exactly Chief\r\n  White relayed to him.Â  It is this testimony, along with the Sheriffâ€™s response\r\n  to the question asked of whether the subject of Thompsonâ€™s conversation with\r\n  the Chief was reflected in Chief Whiteâ€™s testimony, that Thompson apparently\r\n  complains of on appeal.Â  However, Thompson made no objection to these questions\r\n  or responses at trial.\r\nAt\r\n  any rate, assuming that Thompsonâ€™s single â€œhearsayâ€ objection was sufficient to\r\n  constitute an objection to the line of questioning regarding what Chief White\r\n  relayed to Sheriff Wells, we find no error.Â  First, Sheriff Wells did not\r\n  testify, as Thompson maintains, that â€œChief White relayed to him the same\r\n  information to which he had testified at trial.â€Â  Sheriff Wells merely stated\r\n  the Chief â€œrelat[ed] to [him] what had been saidâ€ and that the subject of the conversation was reflected in Chief Whiteâ€™s testimony.Â  Rule 801(c), SCRE, provides, â€œâ€˜Hearsayâ€™ is\r\n  a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial\r\n  or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.â€ A\r\n  statement is defined as â€œ(1) an oral or written assertion or (2) nonverbal\r\n  conduct of a person, if it is intended by the person as an assertion.â€Â  Rule\r\n  801(a), SCRE.Â  There was no oral or written assertion or nonverbal conduct\r\n  testified to by the Sheriff and therefore the testimony complained of does not\r\n  qualify as a statement under the rule.Â   \r\nFurther, even if the complained of testimony did amount to a\r\n  statement, it was not a statement used to prove the truth of the matter\r\n  asserted.Â  See State v. Weaver, 361 S.C. 73, 86-87, 602\r\n  S.E.2d 786, 792-93 (Ct. App. 2004), affâ€™d as modified, 374 S.C. 313, 649\r\n  S.E.2d 479 (2007) (finding no error in the admission of evidence because testimony did not constitute hearsay where officer never repeated\r\n  statements made to him by individuals at the crime scene, but testified only to\r\n  the conclusions he made based on what his investigation had revealed and testimony\r\n  was offered to explain part of his investigation); State v. Thompson,\r\n  352 S.C. 552, 558, 559, 575 S.E.2d 77, 81 (Ct. App. 2003) (finding testimony\r\n  concerning a statement from a bystander to the police was not hearsay because\r\n  it was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted but rather to\r\n  explain and outline the investigation and the officerâ€™s reason for going to the\r\n  defendantâ€™s home); State v. Kirby, 325 S.C. 390, 396, 481 S.E.2d 150,\r\n  153 (Ct. App. 1996) (concluding testimony by police officer about dispatcherâ€™s\r\n  call informing of drugs and firearms in a car was not hearsay where offered to\r\n  explain the reason for the initiation of police surveillance of the vehicle in\r\n  question); State v. Brown, 317 S.C. 55, 63, 451 S.E.2d 888, 894 (1994)\r\n  (holding an out of court statement is not hearsay if it is offered for the\r\n  limited purpose of explaining why a government investigation was undertaken).Â \r\n  Here, the testimony was offered to explain the reason behind the actions\r\n  Sheriff Wells was required to take.Â  Accordingly, we conclude this testimony\r\n  was not hearsay and was properly admitted to explain the necessity of the\r\n  actions Sheriff Wells took to secure the safety of Judge Westbrook and the\r\n  courthouse.\r\nFinally, even if the Sheriffâ€™s testimony constituted inadmissible\r\n  hearsay, the admission was harmless.Â  Chief White testified as to the\r\n  conversation he had with Thompson and that he reported this conversation to\r\n  Sheriff Wells.Â  Thus, the Sheriffâ€™s testimony that Chief White related what had\r\n  been said in his conversation with Thompson and that the subject of Chief\r\n  Whiteâ€™s conversation with Sheriff Wells was reflected in the Chiefâ€™s testimony\r\n  is merely cumulative to Chief Whiteâ€™s testimony.Â  See State v.\r\n    Haselden, 353 S.C. 190, 197, 577 S.E.2d 445, 448-49 (2003) (any error in\r\n  admission of evidence cumulative to other unobjected-to evidence is harmless); State\r\n    v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985) (improper\r\n  admission of hearsay evidence is reversible error only when the admission\r\n  causes prejudice).\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Thompsonâ€™s\r\n  conviction is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and PIEPER, JJ., and GOOLSBY, AJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]This code section provides in pertinent part:\r\n(A) It is unlawful for a\r\n  person by threat or force to:\r\n\r\n\t(1)\r\n  intimidate or impede a judge, magistrate, juror, witness, or potential juror or\r\n  witness, arbiter, commissioner, or member of any commission of this State or\r\n  any other official of any court, in the discharge of his duty as such;Â  or\r\n\t(2) destroy,\r\n  impede, or attempt to obstruct or impede the administration of justice in any\r\n  court.\r\n\r\nS.C.

App. 2004)(citation omitted).Â  â€œThe mere possibility of drawing\r\n  two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent a finding from\r\n  being supported by substantial evidence.â€Â  Id. at 420, 604 S.E.2d at\r\n  707.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellant raises\r\n  multiple challenges to the ALCâ€™s order.Â  Appellant first argues that SCDOT\r\n  never acquired its right of direct access to the property from the road, and,\r\n  therefore, SCDOT has failed to establish the road as a controlled access\r\n  highway.Â  The majority of\r\n  Appellantâ€™s remaining arguments center on the status of the road at the time of\r\n  filing its application.Â  Specifically, Appellant\r\n  argues that the road was not a controlled access highway at the time of the\r\n  filing of its request for the permit,\r\n  and, accordingly, it is vested with a right to the permit.Â  Appellant also argues that it filed its permit request in good faith, and therefore, the\r\n  ALCâ€™s reliance on Sherman v. Reaves, 273 S.C. 542, 257 S.E.2d 735 (1979)\r\n  constitutes error.Â  Appellant also argues\r\n  that pursuant to the holdings\r\n  in Pure Oil Division v. The City of Columbia, 254 S.C. 28, 34-35, 173\r\n  S.E.2d 140, 143 (1970) and Scott v. Greenville County, 716 F.2d 1409,\r\n  1418 (1983), its motion for summary judgment should have been granted.\r\nAdditionally, Appellant argues that SCDOT is estopped from\r\n  claiming the road was established as a controlled access highway and that the issuance of an outdoor advertising permit is a ministerial act.Â  We find all\r\n  of Appellantâ€™s arguments to be without merit.\r\nI) APPELLANTâ€™S\r\n  RIGHT OF DIRECT ACCESS\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues SCDOT never acquired its right of direct access to the property from the\r\n  road, and, therefore, SCDOT has failed to establish the road as a controlled\r\n  access highway.Â  The terms of Appellantâ€™s lease specifically address the access\r\n  conferred to the Appellant.Â  Pursuant to the lease, Appellant received a right\r\n  to â€œsufficient access to allow [Appellant] to service and maintainâ€ the\r\n  billboard.Â  The ALC found Appellant had sufficient access to the property by way\r\n  of the service roads.Â  Appellant never possessed a right of direct access to or\r\n  from the road for SCDOT to acquire.Â  Therefore, we find this issue to be\r\n  without merit.Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nII) THE ROADâ€™S STATUS AT THE\r\n  TIME OF FILING\r\nAppellant argues its application for an outdoor advertising permit\r\n  was properly filed with SCDOT before the road became a controlled access\r\n  highway, and, accordingly, it is vested with a right to the permit.Â  We disagree.[2]\r\nAppellant\r\n  cites the cases of Pure\r\n    Oil Division v. The City of Columbia, 254 S.C. 28, 34-35, 173 S.E.2d 140, 143 (1970) and Scott v.\r\n      Greenville County, 716 F.2d 1409, 1418 (1983) for the proposition that it\r\n  was vested with a right to the permit at the time of filing its application.Â  We\r\n  find Appellantâ€™s reliance on these cases to be misplaced.\r\nUnlike the present case, both cases cited by Appellant deal with permits\r\n  for land uses that were expressly allowed by the applicable zoning ordinances. Â Furthermore,\r\n  the aggrieved parties in both of the cases cited by Appellant detrimentally\r\n  changed their positions in reliance on the zoning ordinances. Â Appellant has\r\n  not changed its position in reliance on the permit at issue here.Â  Appellant\r\n  leased the property for the purpose of constructing a billboard.Â  Appellant was\r\n  issued an outdoor advertising permit and completed construction of the\r\n  billboard.Â  However, Appellant failed to comply with the requirements in order\r\n  to keep the permit effective and, accordingly, was ordered to remove the\r\n  billboard.Â  Appellantâ€™s detrimental change in position was caused by its\r\n  failure to satisfy the requirements of keeping the original permit in effect.Â  Therefore,\r\n  we find the cases cited by Appellant to be inapplicable to the case before us. \r\n \r\nWe find the present case to be closer to Sherman v. Reaves,\r\n  273 S.C. 542, 257 S.E.2d 735 (1979).Â  In Sherman, the Supreme Court\r\n  refused to apply the holding of Pure Oil Division to facts similar to\r\n  those currently before us.Â  The distinction between the cases was Sherman had â€œpresented little, if any, proof of expenditures or incurrence of obligations\r\n  in good faith reliance upon their proposed use.â€ Id. at 545, 257 S.E.2d\r\n  at 737.Â  Appellant contends the ALC committed error by citing this case in\r\n  support of its order given that Appellantâ€™s application was filed in good\r\n  faith.Â  We are not persuaded by this argument.Â  Where there is no expenditure\r\n  or incurrence of obligation, there is also no expenditure or incurrence of obligation\r\n  made in good faith.Â  While the Supreme Court did address the issue of Shermanâ€™s lack of good faith in his filing, the outcome of the case turned on the lack of\r\n  detrimental reliance.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn the present case, Appellant applied to SCDOT for an outdoor\r\n  advertising permit around June 4, 2004.Â  By letter dated July 2, 2004, SCDOT\r\n  informed Appellant that the review process for the permit request would require\r\n  additional time beyond the standard 30 days for investigation.[3]Â  While it is unclear exactly when the road became a controlled\r\n  access highway, it is clear SCDOT acquired the property ownersâ€™ rights of direct access to and from the\r\n  road on June 16, 2003.Â  It is also clear access to and from the section of the road adjacent to the proposed\r\n  site of the billboard was controlled by August 31, 2004, due to SCDOT blocking direct access to the\r\n  property by placing concrete barriers along the road.Â  Accordingly, access to the\r\n  section of the road adjacent to the proposed site became controlled before\r\n  SCDOT completed its investigation.Â Â Â Â Â   \r\nSection 57-25-140(E) of the South Carolina Code (the five hundred\r\n  feet rule) provides: â€œNo sign may be located on the interstate system or\r\n  controlled access federal-aid primary route adjacent to or within 500 feet of\r\n  an interchangeâ€¦.â€ South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 57-25-140(E) (Supp. 2006).\r\n  Likewise, Regulation 63-346(B)(1)(b) provides: â€œno sign in a rural,\r\n  unincorporated area may be erected within 500 feet of an interchange or rest\r\n  area.â€Â  25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 63-346(B)(1)(b) (Supp. 2006).Â  It is undisputed that the proposed site for the billboard is\r\n  located within 500 feet of an interchange. Â Accordingly, there is substantial\r\n  evidence in the record to support the ALCâ€™s finding that Appellantâ€™s permit\r\n  application failed to satisfy the requirements of section 57-25-140(E) and\r\n  Regulation 63-346(B)(1)(b).\r\nIII) ESTOPPEL\r\nAppellant argues SCDOT is estopped from arguing the road\r\n  was established as a controlled access highway due to Joyce Gardener stating\r\n  the section of the road adjacent to the property was not controlled access.Â \r\n  Appellant, in its brief, states it â€œraised this issue for the sole purpose of\r\n  barring SCDOT from taking a position that controlled access was established for\r\n  U.S. 176 in front of the property prior to [Appellantâ€™s] 2004 Permit Request\r\n  Application.â€Â  Given our holding as to the time at which access to the road\r\n  became controlled, this issue is irrelevant.Â  Moreover, while a government\r\n  agency is not immune from the application of the doctrine of equitable\r\n  estoppel, it cannot be estopped based on the\r\n  unauthorized or erroneous statements of its officers or agents. Â South Carolina Coastal Council v. Vogel, 292 S.C.\r\n  449, 452-3, 357 S.E.2d 187, 189&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1987).Â   \r\nIV) MINISTERIAL ACT\r\nAppellant contends the issuance of an outdoor advertising permit\r\n  is a ministerial act, and, therefore, SCDOT lacks discretion in granting such\r\n  permits.Â  This contention is based on the language of South Carolina Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 57-25-150(B) (Supp. 2006) which states permits for signs coming within the\r\n  exception in item (8) of subsection (A) of Â§ 57-25-140 â€œshallâ€ be issued.Â \r\n  However, section 57-25-140(E) (the five hundred feet rule) expressly applies to\r\n  signs permitted under item (8) of subsection (A) of Â§ 57-25-140. Â \r\nThe\r\n  words of a statute â€œmust be given their plain and ordinary\r\n  meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expandâ€ the\r\n  statuteâ€™s operation. Â Hitatchi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C.\r\n  174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992). Â However, â€œ[t]he cardinal rule of statutory\r\n  construction is to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intent whenever\r\n  possible.â€ Â Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Commn., 332 S.C. 54,\r\n  62, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998). Â â€œAll rules of statutory construction are\r\n  subservient to the one that the legislative intent must prevail if it can be\r\n  reasonably discovered in the language used, and that language must be construed\r\n  in the light of the intended purpose of the statute.â€ Â Kiriakides v. United\r\n    Artists Commcâ€™ns, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994).Â  Applying the â€œshallâ€ in Â§ 57-25-150(B)\r\n  literally without factoring in the express limitation included in Â§ 57-25-140\r\n  would result in the issuance of a permit for the erection of a sign that cannot\r\n  legally be erected.Â  Clearly, this cannot be the outcome intended by the\r\n  Legislature.Â  Accordingly, we find this argument to be without merit.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the\r\n  reasons stated above, the order of the ALC is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, SHORT, and WILLIAMS JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] This transformation was part of a three mile\r\n  improvement project for I-585.Â  The project started in 1999 with funding\r\n  allocations.Â  SCDOT started acquiring right-of-way for the project in 2001 and\r\n  acquired the rights of direct access to the subject property in 2003.Â  Physical\r\n  construction on the project began in June of 2004, but there was no physical\r\n  indication of the project in the proximity of the subject property until the\r\n  end of August of 2004 when SCDOT used concrete barriers to block direct access\r\n  to the property.  \r\n[2] We have summarized, combined, and addressed Appellantâ€™s arguments dealing with the\r\n  status of the road at the time of filing its application into this issue.\r\n[3] Regulation 63-349(L) provides:\r\n\r\n\tUpon\r\n  receipt of the permit application, the District Sign Coordinator will inspect\r\n  the sign site in order to ascertain if the location legally qualifies.Â  The\r\n  Department reserves the right to consider any application for a sign permit for\r\n  up to 30 days from the date the application is submitted.Â  Any application not\r\n  approved within that time may be deemed by the applicant to have been rejected\r\n  unless the Department notifies the applicant in writing on the reasons it\r\n  requires further time to investigate the application.\r\n\r\n25A S.C.

Stanton Cross, Jr., Master-In-Equity\r\nUnpublished Opinion No.Â  2007-UP-542\r\nHeard June 6, 2007 â€“ Filed November 30,\r\n  2007Â  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tCarl Scott Masel, of Myrtle Beach, for Appellants.\r\n\t\t\t\tMason Summers and Charles E. Carpenter, Jr., both of Columbia, for\r\n  Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Â Reese\r\n  and Brenda Helms appeal the master-in-equityâ€™s denial of their motion for\r\n  non-suit claiming John and Jeanne Marceron failed to prove that the Helms breached\r\n  the contract between the parties or that they suffered any damages as a result.Â \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Helmses were the owners of a home located on a lot they leased inside of Ocean\r\n  Lakes Family Campground (Ocean Lakes).[1]Â \r\n  The Helmses decided to subdivide their lease site (MH9) into three separate lease\r\n  sites (MH9-A, MH9-B, and MH9-C).[2]Â \r\n  The Helmses hired a surveyor to survey their lease site to ensure that each new\r\n  site would meet Ocean Lakesâ€™ minimum size requirement.Â   \r\nIn the summer of 2003, the Marcerons and the Helmses began\r\n  discussing the possibility of the Marcerons purchasing the lease rights to\r\n  MH9.Â  As a result of these discussions, on June 7, 2004, the Marcerons entered\r\n  into a contract with the Helmses to purchase MH9-C for $90,000.00.Â  The\r\n  contract required the Helmses to provide a survey of MH9-C and gave the\r\n  Marcerons a right of first refusal for MH9-A and MH9-B.Â  The contract provided\r\n  that the closing would occur on June 8, 2007, and that MH9 would be subdivided\r\n  to create MH9-C on or before October 1, 2004.Â  Also on June 7, 2004, John\r\n  Marceron and Reese Helms met with Wayne Peeler, a builder the Helms had\r\n  contacted about constructing a home on the site, at the lease site to ensure\r\n  the proposed home would fit on the site.Â  At this meeting, Reese Helms gave John\r\n  Marceron a survey of MH9 with the proposed subdivided lots marked on it. It is\r\n  undisputed that this survey did not accurately depict the size of MH9-C or its\r\n  existing boundaries as set by Ocean Lakes.Â  The\r\n  inaccuracy in the survey was due to an earlier shifting of the boundary lines\r\n  by Ocean Lakes to resolve a dispute with an adjoining neighbor.Â  The moving of\r\n  the boundary lines resulted in an overall increase in the square footage of\r\n  MH9-C and decrease in the lake frontage of MH9 as a whole.Â  Following the meeting, the Marcerons\r\n  purchased the lease rights to MH9-C from the Helmses for the agreed upon price.\r\nBy letter dated June 15, 2004, Reese Helms informed the Marcerons he\r\n  had received an offer of $180,000.00 for the lease rights to the remaining\r\n  portions of MH9 and gave them until June 27, 2004 to exercise their right of\r\n  first refusal by matching the offer.Â  By letter dated June 23, 2004, the\r\n  Marcerons informed the Helmses they would purchase the lease rights to all of\r\n  MH9 for the price of $260,000.00 and the earlier payment of $90,000.00 should\r\n  be treated as a prepayment towards this transaction.Â  The letter also expressly\r\n  stated: â€œThis [agreement] does not change any agreement per our original\r\n  contract on June 7, 2004.â€Â  On July 2, 2003, the Marcerons paid the Helms the\r\n  agreed upon amount and received a written lease from Ocean Lakes for MH9.Â \r\n \r\nThe Marcerons claim they were not aware of the previous change in\r\n  the boundary line until after their purchase of the lease rights.Â  After\r\n  unsuccessfully attempting to resolve the boundary line issue with the Helms and\r\n  Ocean Lakes, the Marcerons initiated this current action on October 18, 2004.Â \r\n  The Marcerons alleged the following causes of action: breach of contract;\r\n  negligent misrepresentation; fraud; and breach with fraudulent intent.Â  The\r\n  Marcerons sought damages in the amount of the difference between the values of\r\n  the site as represented in the survey and the site as actually conveyed,\r\n  punitive damages, and reasonable attorney fees and costs for the action.Â  By\r\n  consent, the case was referred to the Horry County Master in Equity, J. Stanton\r\n  Cross, Jr.Â  The matter was heard at trial on March 30, 2006.Â  At the conclusion\r\n  of the Marceronsâ€™ case, the Helms moved for a directed verdict on all issues.Â \r\n  The Master informed the Helms that they were really seeking an involuntary\r\n  nonsuit, treated their motion as such, and denied their motion.Â  By final order\r\n  filed June 9, 2006, the Master found in favor of the Marcerons for breach of\r\n  contract and awarded damages in the amount of $26,000.00 which represented the\r\n  difference in the value of the lot as contracted and the value of the lot as\r\n  conveyed.Â  The Helms now appeal the Masterâ€™s denial of their motion for\r\n  involuntary nonsuit claiming the Marcerons failed to prove the Helms breached\r\n  the contract between the parties or that they suffered any damages as a result.Â Â \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nWe\r\n  note initially that while the Helmsâ€™ motion at the close of the evidence was\r\n  couched as a â€œdirected verdictâ€ motion, governed by Rule 50, SCRCP, this was a\r\n  non-jury action. Â Rule 50, SCRCP, as noted by the master, is only applicable to\r\n  jury trials. Â The proper motion for the Helmsâ€™ to have made was a motion for\r\n  involuntary non-suit under Rule 41(b), SCRCP. Â â€œAfter the plaintiff in an\r\n  action tried by the court without a jury has completed the presentation of his\r\n  evidence, the defendant, . . . may move for a dismissal on the ground that upon\r\n  the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief.â€ Rule 41(b),\r\n  SCRCP.Â  Rule 41(b), SCRCP, â€œallows the judge as fact finder to weigh the\r\n  evidence, determine the facts and render a judgment\r\n  against the plaintiff at the close of his case if justified.â€ Â Johnson\r\n    v. J.P. Stevens &amp; Co., 308 S.C. 116, 118, 417 S.E.2d 527, 529 (1992). \r\n \r\nIn\r\n  reviewing the rulings of a trial judge on motions for involuntary nonsuit, this\r\n  Court must review the evidence and all inferences in the light most favorable\r\n  to the nonmoving party. Â Rewis v. Grand Strand Gen. Hosp., 290 S.C. 40, 41-2, 348 S.E.2d 173, 174 (1986). If more than one\r\n  reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence, the motion for nonsuit\r\n  must be denied. Â Id.Â  â€œIn deciding a motion for nonsuit, the trial court\r\n  must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most\r\n  favorable to the plaintiff.â€ Â Bullard v. Ehrhardt, 283 S.C. 557, 558, 324\r\n  S.E.2d 61, 61 (1984). â€œIf there is no relevant competent evidence reasonably\r\n  tending to establish the material elements of the plaintiffâ€™s case a motion for\r\n  nonsuit must be granted.â€ Â Id.\r\nâ€œA\r\n  breach of contract seeking money damages is an action at law.â€Â  South Carolina Fed. Sav. Bank v. Thornton-Crosby Dev. Co., 310 S.C. 232, 235,\r\n  423 S.E.2d 114, 116&nbsp;(1992).Â  On appeal of an action at law tried without a\r\n  jury, â€œthe findings of fact of the trial court will not be disturbed unless\r\n  found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  findings. The rule is\r\n  the same with or without a reference.â€ Â Townes\r\n    Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775\r\n  (1976). The trial courtâ€™s findings are equivalent to a juryâ€™s findings in a law\r\n  action. Â Chapman v. Allstate Ins. Co., 263 S.C. 565, 567, 211 S.E.2d\r\n  876, 877 (1975). Â This courtâ€™s role is to determine whether any evidence\r\n  reasonably supports the factual findings of the trial court. Â Townes\r\n    Assocs., Ltd., 266 S.C. at 86, 221 S.E.2d at 776. Â Additionally, the\r\n  appellate court can correct errors of law. Okatie River, L.L.C. v. Southeastern Site Prep, L.L.C., 353 S.C. 327, 334, 577 S.E.2d 468,\r\n  472 (Ct. App. 2003).  \r\nWhile\r\n  the facts of this particular case are unique, the standard of review applies\r\n  and operates here like in any other case.Â  Accordingly, if there was any\r\n  evidence or reasonable inference to reasonably support the Maceronsâ€™ case, we\r\n  must affirm the Masterâ€™s denial of the Helmsesâ€™ motion for involuntary\r\n  nonsuit.Â  Likewise, if there is any evidence in the record which reasonably supports\r\n  the Masterâ€™s final determination, we must affirm.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIn\r\n  an action for breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove the existence of a\r\n  contract, its breach, and damages caused by the breach.Â  See Baughman\r\n    v.

Co. 127 S.C. 493, 121 S.E. 356, 356&nbsp;(1924).\r\n\r\n\tThe contract for MH9-C provided:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tConveyance Shall Be Made subject to all easements as well as covenants of record (providing\r\n  they do not make title unmarketable) and all governmental [statutes],\r\n  ordinances, rules and regulations: A survey map of leased lot 9C, section MH\r\n  shall be provided by the seller prior to the closing date.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n(Bolded in the\r\n  original).Â  The Helmses claim this requirement does not apply because it was\r\n  included in the contract for the lease rights to MH9-C and not in the agreement\r\n  for MH9 in its entirety.Â  However, included in the letter in which the\r\n  Marcerons exercised their right of first refusal to the remainder of MH9 is a\r\n  provision that states: â€œThis does not change any agreement per our original\r\n  contract. . . .â€Â  Furthermore, it is clear that the parties, while contracting\r\n  for MH9-C, had considered a transfer of MH9 in its entirety.Â  The contract for\r\n  MH9-C included the right of first refusal for the remainder of MH9 and the\r\n  survey provided as part of the transaction for MH9-C was a survey of MH9 in its\r\n  entirety. Accordingly, there is evidence in the record to support the Masterâ€™s\r\n  finding that the Helmses were required to provide a survey as part of the\r\n  contract for MH9.\r\nImplicit in the requirement to provide a survey is the requirement\r\n  that the survey which is provided be an accurate survey.Â  â€œCommon sense and good faith are the\r\n  leading touchstones of construction of the provisions of a contract; where one\r\n  construction makes the provisions unusual or extraordinary and another\r\n  construction which is equally consistent with the language employed, would make\r\n  it reasonable, fair and just, the latter construction must prevail.â€Â  C.A.N. Enters., Inc. v. South Carolina Health &amp;\r\n    Human Servs. Fin. Comâ€™n&nbsp; 296\r\n  S.C. 373, 377, 373 S.E.2d 584, 586&nbsp;(1988) (citing Farr v. Duke Power Co., 265 S.C. 356, 360, 218 S.E.2d 431, 434 (1975)).Â  It is undisputed that the survey\r\n  provided by the Helmses was inaccurate.Â   \r\nDuring\r\n  the trial, Reese Helms testified that at the meeting, he informed John Maceron\r\n  of the inaccuracy of the survey due to an earlier shifting of the boundary\r\n  lines by Ocean Lakes to resolve a dispute with an adjoining neighbor.Â  Brenda\r\n  Helms testified that she discussed the shift in the boundary line with John\r\n  Marceron on the day of the meeting.Â  Wayne Peeler testified that Reese Helms\r\n  informed John Marceron at the meeting that the boundary line had been moved.Â \r\n  He also testified that the measurements the three men used to lay out the home\r\n  site reflected the change in the boundary line.Â  However, John Marceron\r\n  testified that he was unaware of the inaccuracy of the survey or the change in\r\n  the boundary line.Â   \r\nDespite\r\n  the conflicting testimony, the Master found the Marcerons were unaware of the\r\n  inaccuracies in the survey. Â Although John Marceronâ€™s testimony conflicts with other evidence in the record, our\r\n  standard of review dictates that we affirm if any evidence exists in the record\r\n  to reasonably support the findings of the Master and does not allow us to weigh\r\n  the evidence. Accordingly, we find evidence to support the Masterâ€™s finding\r\n  that Marcerons were unaware of the inaccuracies in the survey.Â  See Sherman v. W &amp; B Enters., Inc.&nbsp;357 S.C. 243, 250, 592 S.E.2d 307,\r\n  310&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).  \r\nThe Helmsesâ€™\r\n  argue that because the dimensions and boundaries of lots in Ocean Lakes are subject to change conferring lease rights to sites of set dimensions is\r\n  impossible.Â  We are not persuaded by this argument.Â  By the terms of the\r\n  contract, the Helmses agreed to provide a survey of the lot to be conveyed. The\r\n  inaccuracies in the survey were material to the contract because the survey\r\n  provided the only means by which the Marcerons could determine the land of\r\n  which they were purchasing the lease rights.Â  The moved boundary line served as\r\n  the boundary between the MH9 and the adjoining lease site.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  physical change to the boundary line which was not reflected in the survey\r\n  equally affected lot MH9 in its entirety and the proposed lot MH9-C.Â  Â \r\nThe\r\n  Helms claim that because the value of the lease site now exceeds the amount the\r\n  Marcerons paid, the Marcerons cannot show any resulting damages.Â  This argument\r\n  is unpersuasive.Â  â€œIn a breach of contract action, damages serve to place the\r\n  nonbreaching party in the position he would have enjoyed had the contract been\r\n  performed.â€Â  South Carolina Federal Sav. Bank v. Thornton-Crosby\r\n    Development Co., Inc.&nbsp; 303 S.C. 74, 77, 399 S.E.2d 8,10 - 11&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App.1990).Â  The Marceron sought damages based on the correct measure: the\r\n  difference in the value of the lot as contracted for and the value of the lot\r\n  as conveyed.  \r\nâ€œIn South Carolina, a property owner is competent to offer testimony as to the value of his property.â€ Abercrombie v. Abercrombie,&nbsp;372 S.C. 643, 647,\r\n  643 S.E.2d 697, 699&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2007) (citing Cooper v. Cooper, 289\r\n  S.C. 377, 379, 346 S.E.2d 326, 327 (Ct. App. 1986)).Â  The rule that a property\r\n  owner is competent to present an opinion as to the propertyâ€™s value is well\r\n  recognized. Lewis v. South Carolina State Highway Dept., 278 S.C. 170,\r\n  173, 293 S.E.2d 434, 436 (1982).  \r\nJohn\r\n  Marceron testified that the value of the lease site was based heavily on the\r\n  amount of lake frontage the lot had.Â  He testified that the lot as represented\r\n  in the survey had a total of 153 feet of lake frontage, but the lot as conveyed\r\n  only had 138 feet of lake frontage.Â  He testified that the difference between\r\n  the two measurements equaled ten percent of the total lake frontage as\r\n  represented in the survey.Â  He also testified that the increase in the total\r\n  amount of square footage did not increase the value of the lease site.Â  He\r\n  stated the additional land was valueless to him because it was made up of a\r\n  roadway and an unsightly berm. Â He also testified that the total purchase price\r\n  for MH9 was $260,000.00 and explained that he was seeking ten percent of the\r\n  total purchase in damages as result of the reduction in lake frontage.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  there is evidence in the record support the Masterâ€™s findings as to damages.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the\r\n  reasons stated above, the order of the Master is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, SHORT, and WILLIAMS JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The lots located inside Ocean Lakes are referred to\r\n  as lease sites because they are owned by Ocean Lakes and are leased to\r\n  individuals who construct or position homes upon them.Â  Ocean Lakes, at all times, retains the right to adjust and move the boundary lines of any and all\r\n  lease sites.Â  Accordingly, the lease sites do not have permanently set boundary\r\n  lines.Â Â Â Â Â Â   \r\n[2] Ocean Lakes allows individuals to subdivide their\r\n  lease sites as long as each proposed site will have at least 3,000 square feet\r\n  based on the existing boundaries as set by Ocean Lakes.Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-543","title":"Shannon v.

Vanvolkenburg, 312 S.C. 373,\r\n  375, 440 S.E.2d 408, 409 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  We will not disturb a discretionary\r\n  ruling on appeal unless the ruling is without any evidentiary support or\r\n  controlled by an error of law.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBefore we address whether the Special\r\n  Referee committed reversible error by not setting aside the entry of default,\r\n  we confront the issue of whether this appeal is properly before us.Â   \r\nA. This appeal\r\n  is properly before us. Â \r\nShannon initially argues this Court lacks jurisdiction to\r\n  decide this case because this appeal constitutes an interlocutory appeal.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nGenerally,\r\n  an appeal to this Court will be allowed only if there has been a final judgment.Â  Hagood v. Sommerville, 362 S.C. 191, 194, 607 S.E.2d 707, 708 (2005).Â  For\r\n  the purposes of determining whether an order is appealable, â€œfinal judgmentâ€\r\n  refers to the disposition of all the issues in the case.Â  Doe v. Howe,\r\n  362 S.C. 212, 216, 607 S.E.2d 354, 356 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The present case\r\n  constitutes a â€œfinal judgmentâ€ by the Special Referee.  \r\nThe\r\n  Special Referee denied Hoodâ€™s motion to set aside the entry of default and\r\n  entered a default judgment of $1,475,000.Â  This terminates the litigation because all Shannon must do to recover the judgment amount is collect.Â  See Ateyeh v. United\r\n    of Omaha Life Ins. Co., 293 S.C. 436, 437, 361 S.E.2d 340, 340 (Ct. App.\r\n  1987) (An order setting aside an entry of default is not appealable absent a\r\n  final judgment.); Thynes v. Lloyd, 294 S.C. 152, 153, 363 S.E.2d 122,\r\n  122 (Ct. App. 1987) (An order refusing to set aside an entry of default is not\r\n  appealable until after final judgment.). However, even if we assume the Special\r\n  Refereeâ€™s order is not a final judgment, this appeal is properly before us.\r\nThe\r\n  following four situations permit a party to appeal absent a final judgment: \r\n \r\n\r\n\t(1)\r\n  intermediate judgments, orders or decrees involving the merits, (2) orders\r\n  affecting substantial rights when such orders in effect determine the action\r\n  and prevent a judgment from which an appeal may be taken or when the orders\r\n  discontinue the action, (3) a final order in special proceedings, and (4)\r\n  interlocutory orders [relating to injunctions].\r\n\r\nÂ Walker v. Springs\r\n  Indus., Inc., 298 S.C. 249, 251, 379 S.E.2d 729, 730 (Ct. App. 1989).\r\nAn\r\n  order affects a substantial right if the order determines and discontinues the\r\n  action.Â  Brown v. County of Berkeley, 366 S.C. 354, 361, 622 S.E.2d 533,\r\n  537 (2005).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Special Refereeâ€™s order in the current case determines\r\n  and discontinues the action.Â  The order determines the action because Hood is\r\n  held liable for the injuries suffered by Shannon.Â  The order terminates the\r\n  action because all Shannon must do to recover the judgment amount is collect.Â  Thus,\r\n  this appeal is properly before us.Â   \r\nB. The Special\r\n  Referee committed reversible error in not setting aside the entry of default.\r\nAs noted above, the decision of whether to\r\n  grant relief from an entry of default is a matter solely within the sound\r\n  discretion of the trial court.Â  Bage, LLC v. Se. Roofing Co. of Spartanburg,\r\n    Inc., 373 S.C. 457, 471, 646 S.E.2d 153, 160 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  An abuse of\r\n  discretion arises if the lower courtâ€™s decision is controlled by an error of\r\n  law or is without evidentiary support.Â  Id. at 464-65, 646 S.E.2d at\r\n  157.Â  Consequently, the question before us is not whether we believe good cause\r\n  existed to set aside the entry of default, but whether the Special Refereeâ€™s\r\n  determination is supported by evidence and not controlled by an error of law.Â  Id. \r\n \r\nâ€œFor good cause shown the court may set aside an entry of default .\r\n  . . .â€ Â Rule 55(c), SCRCP.Â  Thus, the standard for granting relief from an\r\n  entry of default is good cause.Â  Bage, LLC, 373 S.C. at 470, 646 S.E.2d at\r\n  160.Â  In this case, the Special Referee applied the good cause standard in\r\n  denying the motion to set aside the entry of default.Â  The Special Referee\r\n  applied the correct legal standard; therefore, the Special Refereeâ€™s decision\r\n  is not controlled by an error of law.Â  Now, we must consider whether the\r\n  Special Refereeâ€™s decision is supported by the evidence.\r\nIn determining whether to set aside an entry of default, the\r\n  factors the Special Referee â€œshould consider are: (1) the timing of the motion\r\n  for relief; (2) whether the defendant has a meritorious defense; and (3) the\r\n  degree of prejudice to the plaintiff if relief is granted.â€Â  Id. at 472,\r\n  646 S.E.2d at 161.Â  The Special Referee did not make specific findings with\r\n  respect to each of these three enumerated factors, but he did apply the factors\r\n  in denying the motion to set aside the entry of default.Â  The Special Referee\r\n  is not required to make specific findings in regard to these factors if\r\n  sufficient evidence supports the finding of the lack of good cause.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nThe first factor is the timing of the motion for relief.Â  In this\r\n  case, Shannon filed the summons and complaint on June 6, 2005. Shannon personally served the summons and complaint on Hood on June 8, 2005.Â  Hood made the\r\n  motion to set aside the entry of default on August 11, 2005.Â  Only two months\r\n  elapsed between the time Hood was served with the summons and complaint and\r\n  when he moved for relief.Â Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nThe second factor is whether the defendant has a meritorious defense.Â Â \r\n  A meritorious defense does not have to be a perfect defense nor does have to be\r\n  guaranteed to prevail at a trial. Graham v. Town of Loris, 272 S.C. 442,\r\n  543, 248 S.E.2d 594, 599 (1978).Â Â  â€œIt need be only one which is worthy of a\r\n  hearing or judicial inquiry because it raises a question of law deserving of\r\n  some investigation and discussion or a real controversy as to essential facts\r\n  arising from conflicting or doubtful evidence.â€ Id.Â  This case arose due\r\n  to an automobile accident.Â  Hood maintains that at the time of the accident,\r\n  McGee was not acting as Hoodâ€™s employee.Â  The issue is worthy of investigation\r\n  and thus the second factor weighs in favor of Hood.\r\nThe final factor is the degree of prejudice to the plaintiff if the\r\n  entry of default is set aside.Â  We fail to see any prejudice that would result\r\n  if entry of default is set aside.Â  It does not appear that evidence essential\r\n  to the adjudication of this case on the merits will be affected by a reversal.Â \r\n  Thus, this factor weighs in favor of Hood.Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the Special Refereeâ€™s decision is  \r\nREVERSED.  [1] \r\n\r\nSTILWELL,\r\n  SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral arguments pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
