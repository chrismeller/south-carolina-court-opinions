Lovelace, Jr of Conway; Robert Norris Hill , of Newberry, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this action to enforce restrictive covenants, William and Janice Paone appeal the master-in-equityâ€™s order requiring them to remove a flagpole and basketball goal from their property and pay Heritage Plantation Ownersâ€™ Association, Inc. $27,575.00 in fines and $15,054.83 in attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThe Paones began construction of their house in Heritage Plantation in late 1999 or early 2000.Â  The Heritage Plantation Declaration of Covenants and Conditions and Restrictions requires owners to receive written approval by the Heritage Plantationsâ€™ Architectural Review Board (ARB) for all construction, including landscaping.Â  In addition to their house plans, the Paones submitted their landscaping and drainage plans to the ARB.Â  Throughout the landscaping project, the ARB required numerous changes to the plans.Â  At the Paonesâ€™ direction, the ARB conferred with the Paonesâ€™ general contractor, Bruce Carrell, who had built numerous homes in Heritage Plantation.Â  On July 10, 2000, the ARB held a special meeting to consider the Paonesâ€™ construction.Â  In a letter sent that day, the ARB required several revisions to the landscaping plan.Â  The Paonesâ€™ landscaper claimed that on July 20, 2000, he submitted a revised landscaping plan for the meeting that was to be held that day.Â  Those plans included a flagpole.Â  The agenda and minutes of the ARBâ€™s July 20 meeting do not indicate that the Paonesâ€™ landscaping was discussed at that meeting.Â  \r\nAt the August 3, 2000 meeting, the ARB again considered the Paonesâ€™ landscape plan.Â  It approved the plan subject to completion of the installation of landscaping material on the exterior side of the north fence.Â  After this meeting, members of the ARB noticed the flagpole and a portable basketball goal on the Paone property.Â  The ARB sent Carrell a letter on August 24, 2000 advising him that although flagpoles may be approved, the ARB must approve the location prior to installation.Â  It stated the current flagpole location was not acceptable.Â  The ARB also advised Carrell that portable basketball goals are not permitted and basketball goals must be permanently installed.Â  It directed Carrell to re-submit plans showing the permanently installed basketball goal and the new location of the flagpole to the ARB for approval.Â  In a letter dated September 5, 2000, Carrell replied that a revised landscape plan with the location of the flagpole was submitted to the ARB on July 20.Â  It enclosed a copy of the plan.Â  He also explained the Paones had purchased the basketball goal before they understood that only stationary goals were permitted.Â  He asked that the basketball goal be approved since it would be screened by landscaping.Â Â  \r\nThe ARB responded that prior to Carrellâ€™s letter of September 5, 2000, it had never received a landscaping plan indicating a flagpole installation and it had not approved such a plan.Â  The ARB informed Carrell that it had eleven copies of plans for landscape, drainage, irrigation and re-submittals, but the only one showing a flagpole was the one Carrell submitted on September 5, 2000.Â  It requested Carrell submit a site plan with an alternate location for the flagpole that is not directly in front of the home and is some distance from the street.Â  In addition, the ARB did not approve the request for the basketball goal unless it received a letter verifying that the goal is permanently installed.Â  The ARB cautioned that Carrell must submit both an alternate flagpole location and the basketball goal verification before the next ARB meeting on September 21, 2000 and that â€œ[f]ailure to do so will cause this property to be in violation of the Covenants and Guidelines and may incur fines.â€Â  \r\nThe Paonesâ€™ attorney subsequently wrote to the ARB maintaining that the landscaping plans showing the flagpole location were dropped off on July 20, 2000 and this was the plan that was approved on August 3, 2000.Â  The attorney asserted the Paones had no plans for removal of the flagpole at that time.Â  \r\nThe Heritage Plantation Ownersâ€™ Association subsequently brought this action seeking an injunction requiring the removal of the flagpole and portable basketball goal, payment of cumulative fines for violation of the covenants of $25 a day, retroactive to January 1, 2001, and attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  In their answer and counterclaim, the Paones asserted that they submitted landscapes to the ARB containing the flagpole and the ARB approved those plans.Â  They requested a return of their $2,500.00 deposit, damages for their travel costs, lost wages, and emotional distress, and attorneyâ€™s fees and cost.\r\nThe trial court ordered the Paones to immediately take down the flagpole and not re-erect it without written approval by the ARB.Â  It also ordered the Paones to remove the portable basketball goal from view of anyone within Heritage Plantation other than themselves.Â  Although the court found the flagpole and basketball goal were separate violations of the covenants, it imposed a single fine of $25.00 a day from August 15, 2000 through the date of the hearing, for a total of $27,575.00.Â  It also awarded the Association $15,054.83 in attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  The Paones filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, which the trial court denied.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action to enforce a restrictive covenant is in equity.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 622, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302 (2001).Â  In an appeal from an equitable action, tried by a special referee alone, the appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Id.Â  The court should not, however, disregard the findings of the special referee, who was in a better position to weigh the credibility of witnesses.Â  Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 237, 391 S.E.2d 538, 543 (1990). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Existence of violations\r\nThe Paones argue the facts of this case do not support the masterâ€™s ruling because the evidence reveals the Paonesâ€™ plan was submitted and approved.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe Paonesâ€™ landscape designer, Brad Ingram testified that after the ARBâ€™s letter of July 12, 2000 he created a revised landscaping plan.Â  This plan included the flagpole.Â  Ingram explained that normally he would deliver plans to the builder who would in turn submit the plans.Â  In this instance, he received a call from the Paonesâ€™ builder, Bruce Carrell on the morning of July 20 wanting to know if there was any way the plans could be submitted that day in order that they be considered at the ARBâ€™s meeting that evening.Â  Ingram copied the plans himself at the sales office at Heritage Plantation and then delivered the plans to the receptionist at the ownerâ€™s clubhouse by 11:30 a.m.Â  The revised plans, however, were not considered at the ARBâ€™s meeting on July 20.Â  \r\nArt Kent, a member of the ARB during the time the Paones were constructing their home, claimed the ARB never saw the revised plans showing the flagpole location until Carrellâ€™s letter dated September 5, 2000.Â  He asserted that the ARB went through all of its files and did not find the plans Ingram claimed to have delivered on the July 20.Â  Kent averred the ARB had never lost any correspondence before when dealing with 350 homes.Â  He explained that when the ARB approved the Paonesâ€™ basic landscaping plan on August 3, 2000, it considered the written plans that had been submitted for the July 12, 2000 meeting and Carrellâ€™s oral agreement to make the changes required by the ARB.Â  \r\nImportantly, on August 8, 2000 Carrell submitted a request to add the basketball goal to the Paonesâ€™ yard.Â  The attached landscaping plan that showed the addition of the basketball goal did not include the flagpole.Â  Soon after the controversy over the flagpole and basketball goal arose, Carrell wrote to the ARB distancing himself from the matter and instructing the ARB to work directly with Mr. Paone on these issues.Â  In the letter, Carrell stated, â€œNeither the flagpole nor the basketball goal were part of our construction agreement, and we did not arrange for either to be installed.â€Â  However, Carrell did note that he believed the ARBâ€™s letter of August 3, 2000 had approved the revised landscape plan Ingram claimed to have submitted on July 20, 2000, which showed the basketball goal.Â Â  \r\nThis case revolves on the credibility of the Associationâ€™s witnesses, who claimed the ARB never saw or approved landscaping plans showing the flagpole, and the Paonesâ€™ witness Ingram, who claimed to have submitted the plans.Â  We give deference to the masterâ€™s factual findings because he had a better vantage point from which to judge the witnessesâ€™ credibility. Â See Patterson v. Goldsmith, 292 S.C. 619, 626, 358 S.E.2d 163, 167 (Ct. App. 1987) (â€œ[T]he conclusions of the master who observed the demeanor and appearance of the witnesses have peculiar value on questions of credibility of witnesses.â€).Â  Giving such deference to the master, we find the ARB never considered or approved landscaping plans that showed a flagpole.Â  Thus, the Paones violated the covenants by installing the flagpole without the ARBâ€™s approval.Â  \r\nFurthermore, the Paones acknowledged at oral argument they waived any argument concerning placement of the portable basketball goal on their property, which constituted a violation of the covenants.Â  Accordingly, we find no error in the masterâ€™s conclusion that the Association had established two violations of the covenants beginning at or about August 15, 2000.\r\nII.Â  Fines as a penalty\r\nThe Paones argue the amount of the fines awarded by the master was grossly disproportionate to any damage and is an unenforceable penalty.Â  We find this issue is not properly before this court.Â  \r\nIn their complaint, the Association asserted it was entitled to a cumulative fine totaling $25.00 a day.Â  Thus, the Paones were aware that the Association was seeking a significant award of damages from the cumulative fines at the time of the hearing; yet the Paones failed to argue such that the fines were an unenforceable penalty until their motion to alter or amend.Â  A party cannot raise an issue for the first time in a Rule 59(e) motion when the issue could have been raised at trial.Â  MailSource, LLC v. M.A. Bailey &amp; Assoc., Inc., 356 S.C. 370, 588 S.E.2d 639 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Thus, this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  See Dixon v. Dixon, 362 S.C. 388, 608 S.E.2d 849 (2005)(issue raised for first time in Rule 59, SCRCP, motion is not preserved for review).\r\nIII.Â  Reasonableness of attorneyâ€™s fees\r\nThe Paones argue the master erred by not addressing the Jackson v. Speed[1] factors when determining reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  They assert that the case must be remanded for a consideration of the attorneyâ€™s fee request.Â  We disagree. \r\nThere are six factors for the trial court to consider when determining an award of attorneyâ€™s fees:Â  (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) professional standing of counsel; (4) contingency of compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained; and (6) customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. at 308, 486 S.E.2d at 760.Â  \r\nIn his order the master held that the Associationâ€™s attorneyâ€™s itemized statement of fees and costs and an affidavit from another real estate attorney averring the fees and costs were reasonable and satisfied him â€œthat all of the standards in the cannons of ethics with regard to attorneyâ€™s fees and their reasonableness have been met in the examination and scrutiny of [the Associationâ€™s attorneyâ€™s] bill for services.â€ The master awarded the Association $12,164.50 in attorneyâ€™s fees and $2,890.00 in costs.Â Â  \r\nAlthough the master did not list the factors he considered, the master did state he considered factors set out in the â€œcannons of ethics.â€\r\n\r\nThe factors for determining the reasonableness of fees set forth in Rule 1.5 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, include the same factors as those set forth in Jackson v. Speed. [2]   \r\n\r\nThus, in considering the factors set forth in the Rule 1.5 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, the master considered the Jackson v. Speed factors as well as other factors.Â  We find no abuse of discretion in the masterâ€™s award of fees.Â  \r\nIV.Â  Remedies\r\nThe Paones argue the covenants restrict the remedies to either imposition of fines or injunctive relief.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAs restrictive covenants are contractual in nature, the paramount rule of construction is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the parties as determined from the whole document.Â  Taylor v. Lindsey, 332 S.C. 1, 4, 498 S.E.2d 862, 863 (1998).Â  The court in Taylor elucidated:\r\n\r\nThe court may not limit a restriction in a deed, nor, on the other hand, will a restriction be enlarged or extended by construction or implication beyond the clear meaning of its terms even to accomplish what it may be thought the parties would have desired had a situation which later developed been foreseen by them at the time when the restriction was written.Â  It is still the settled rule in this jurisdiction that restrictions as to the use of real estate should be strictly construed and all doubts resolved in favor of free use of the property, subject, however, to the provision that this rule of strict construction should not be applied so as to defeat the plain and obvious purpose of the instrument.Â  \r\n\r\nId.Â  (internal quotations and citations omitted).\r\nArticle 11.04 of the Covenants, titled Enforcement, provides in part:Â  â€œFailure to comply [with the covenants] shall be grounds for imposing fines, for suspending voting rights, or for instituting and action to recover sums due, for damages, and/or for injunctive relief . . . .â€Â  This section further provides:Â  â€œShould Declarant or the Association employ legal counsel to enforce any of the foregoing, all costs incurred in connection with such enforcement, including court costs and reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees, shall be paid by the violating owner. . . .[I]t is hereby declared that any breach [of the covenants, bylaws or rule or regulations of the Association] may not adequately be compensated by recovery of damages, and thatÂ  . . . the Association . . ., in addition to all other remedies, and not by way of limitation, may require and shall be entitled to the equitable remedies of specific performance and of injunction to restrain any such violation or breach or any threatened violation or breach.â€Â  \r\nSections10.03 and 10.04 also authorize the ARB to enjoin further construction and to require removal or correction of any work already in place that does not comply with approved plans and specifications.Â  \r\nConsidering the plain language of the Declaration, we find the Association clearly had the right to impose fines and then to bring an action to recover the sums due from the aggregated fines.Â  In addition, Article 11.04 authorizes the Association to receive attorneyâ€™s fees and costs from its enforcement action.Â  Furthermore, this section provides â€œin addition to all other remediesâ€ the Association is entitled to an injunction to restrain violations of the covenants.Â  Accordingly, we find the master did not err in awarding the Association damages from the fines due and injunctive relief.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the above reasons, the order of the master is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] 326 S.C. 289, 486 S.E.2d 750 (1997).Â Â Â  \r\n[2] We note that Rule 1.5 of the Rules of Professional Conduct applies to the reasonableness of fees between an attorney and client and not to the award of fees to an opposing party.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-002","title":"Johnson v.

Johnson, III, submitted a claim against the Estate of Ralston E. Smith for breach of contract, fraudulent misrepresentation, breach of good faith, conversion, quantum meruit, and sought a constructive trust based on the payment to Smith of tobacco settlement proceeds that belonged to Johnson.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment to Smith, finding Johnsonâ€™s claims barred by the doctrine of accord and satisfaction.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nRalston E. Smith loaned John E. Johnson, III money in 1999, and Smith took title to Johnsonâ€™s farm as security for the loan.Â  According to Johnson, Smith reconveyed title to the farm to him in 2000 after Johnson paid the debt.Â  Nevertheless, Smith received tobacco settlement proceeds in 2001 based on his title to the farm in 1999.Â  On March 11, 2002, Johnson executed a settlement agreement providing:\r\n\r\nIn consideration for the payment of Ten thousand and No/100 Dollars ($10,000.00), the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, I John E. Johnson, III, do hereby agree to release and forever discharge Ralston E. Smith from any and all claims, liabilities, demands, or damages arising from all business transactions between the parties.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Johnson signed a copy of the check he received, which contained a similar release.\r\nOn March 7, 2003, Smith died.Â  Smithâ€™s wife, Stacey G. Smith, and brother serve as co-representatives of his estate (the Estate).Â  Johnson filed a claim in probate court against the Estate, alleging breach of contract, fraudulent misrepresentation, breach of good faith, conversion, quantum meruit, and entitlement to a constructive trust resulting from Smithâ€™s actions with respect to the tobacco allotment.Â  The Estate answered and generally denied Johnsonâ€™s claim.Â  In addition, the Estate asserted various affirmative defenses, including the doctrine of accord and satisfaction, and a counterclaim under the Frivolous Proceedings Act.Â  In support of its accord and satisfaction defense, the Estate attached the executed settlement agreement and check to its answer.Â  On February 10, 2004, the special probate judge removed the case to circuit court.Â  Subsequently, Johnson replied to the Estateâ€™s answer, and generally denied its affirmative defenses and its counterclaim.Â  \r\nPursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) and 12(c), SCRCP, the Estate moved to dismiss Johnsonâ€™s causes of action for failure to state a claim and judgment on the pleadings.Â  On August 26, 2004, the Estate served Johnson with notice of its intent to convert the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.Â  The Estate also filed Stacey Smithâ€™s affidavit at this time.Â  The trial court held a hearing on September 8, 2004, at which time Johnson objected to the lack of adequate notice to the summary judgment motion.Â  Without specifically addressing the notice issue, the trial court held the hearing would be treated as a hearing for summary judgment, but allowed Johnson and the Estate to file supplemental affidavits and other documents within ten days of the hearing.Â  Additionally, the trial court requested the Estate submit a proposed order within thirty days and gave Johnson ten days to respond after service of this proposed order.Â  Johnson did not object to this procedure.Â  Also at this hearing, Johnson claimed for the first time that the settlement agreement resulted from duress and coercion.\r\nJohnson replied to the summary judgment motion on September 17, 2004, and submitted his affidavit that indicated Smith had coerced the settlement agreement or forced Johnson to sign it under duress.Â  Johnson also submitted the affidavit of his brother, Clarke Johnson, in which Clarke indicated he was present at the signing of the settlement agreement, and Smith forced Johnson to sign under duress.Â  The Estate entered a memorandum in support of its motion, and the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the Estate based on the doctrine of accord and satisfaction.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Notice of Summary Judgment\r\nJohnson contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because he did not have sufficient notice of the summary judgment hearing.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œObjections not raised in the trial court cannot be relied on in the appellate court.Â  The duty is on the litigant to make a timely objection in order to preserve the right of review.Â  A contemporaneous objection is required to properly preserve an error for appellate review.â€Â  Doe v. S.B.M.,&nbsp;327 S.C. 352, 356, 488 S.E.2d 878, 880&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997) (citations omitted).Â  Johnson objected at the hearing to the propriety of the notice he received with respect to the Estateâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  The trial court responded to Johnsonâ€™s objection by treating the hearing as one for summary judgment, but allowed Johnson ten days to supplement his opposition to the motion with affidavits and other documents.Â  Johnson did not object to this procedure, did not demand a second hearing, and actively participated by submitting affidavits and a reply to the motion.Â  Only after the trial court granted summary judgment did Johnson object to this procedure.Â  Under these circumstances, Johnson waived his right to assert lack of proper notice on appeal.\r\nII. Genuine Issue of Material Fact\r\nJohnson argues the trial court erred in finding no genuine issue of material fact existed.Â  We disagree.\r\nJohnson specifically argues the trial court erred in finding no genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the settlement agreement was entered into under duress or coercion.Â  First, Johnson failed to appeal the trial courtâ€™s decision that Rule 8(c), SCRCP, required Johnson to specifically plead duress or coercion as an affirmative defense.Â  Johnsonâ€™s only response to this ruling on appeal was that â€œ[t]his ruling by the trial judge fails to address the possibility that, after discovery on this issue . . . [Johnson] could move to amend his pleadings to set forth the affirmative defense of duress.â€Â  Johnson did not present the issue of the possibility of amending his pleadings to the trial court and did not otherwise appeal the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  Therefore, the trial courtâ€™s ruling is the law of the case.Â  See Lindsay v. Lindsay, 328 S.C. 329, 338, 491 S.E.2d 583, 588&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997) (â€œIt is a fundamental rule of law that an appellate court will affirm a ruling by a lower court if the offended party does not challenge that ruling. . . . The unchallenged ruling, â€˜right or wrong, is the law of the case.â€™â€ (citations omitted)).\r\nMoreover, even if Johnson properly appealed the trial courtâ€™s ruling, we hold Johnson was required to specifically plead duress in his reply.Â  â€œIn pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively the defenses: . . . duress . . . and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense. . . . A party may file a reply to any of the foregoing affirmative defenses.â€Â  Rule 8(c), SCRCP.Â  An affirmative defense must be pled to be preserved.Â  Adams v. B &amp; D, Inc.,&nbsp;297 S.C. 416, 419, 377 S.E.2d 315, 317&nbsp;(1989). Â â€œAlthough Rule 8(c) requires a party to set forth affirmative defenses to a â€˜preceding pleading,â€™ this requirement applies only if the party actually pleads responsively to the prior pleading.â€Â  Republic Contr. Corp. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways and Pub. Transp., 332 S.C. 197, 210, 503 S.E.2d 761, 768&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1998). Â Johnson filed a reply and failed to plead duress as a way of avoidance of the Estateâ€™s affirmative defense of accord and satisfaction.Â  Therefore, Rule 8(c), SCRCP, applies, and Johnson waived his right to assert duress.\r\nIII. Opportunity to Conduct Further DiscoveryÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nJohnson contends the trial court erred by entering summary judgment prematurely.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œSince it is a drastic remedy, summary judgment â€˜should be cautiously invoked so that no person will be improperly deprived of a trial of the disputed factual issues.â€™â€Â  Baughman v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co.,&nbsp;306 S.C. 101, 112, 410 S.E.2d 537, 543&nbsp;(1991) (quoting Watson v. Southern Ry. Co., 420 F.Supp. 483, 486 (D.S.C. 1975)).Â  â€œThis means, among other things, that summary judgment must not be granted until the opposing party has had a full and fair opportunity to complete discovery.â€Â  Baughman, 306 S.C. at 112, 410 S.E.2d at 543.Â  In Baughman, the Supreme Court of South Carolina expressly cited two factors to be considered in determining whether the party opposing summary judgment has had a â€œfull and fair opportunity to complete discovery.â€Â  First, the party must demonstrate â€œa likelihood that further discovery will uncover additional evidence relevant to the issue . . . and that they are not merely engaged in a â€˜fishing expedition.â€™â€Â  Id. at 112, 410 S.E.2d at 544.Â  Second, they must demonstrate they were not dilatory in seeking discovery on the particular issue.Â  Id. at 113, 410 S.E.2d at 544.Â  \r\nJohnson has failed to meet either of these requirements.Â  Johnson broadly avers the grant of summary judgment would be fatal to his case and would deny him the right to conduct further discovery.Â  He does not explain the likelihood of success if further discovery were to be allowed, or the specific types of discovery that would help his case.Â  Johnson asserts the parties are only sixty days into the discovery process, and no discovery requests have been answered.Â  However, Johnson admits â€œneither party had taken any depositions or noticed the other party thereof.â€Â  Johnson does not explain whether he has asked for other types of discovery or why he failed to notice depositions at this point.Â  Under these circumstances, we hold Johnson has not demonstrated summary judgment is premature.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold Johnson waived his right to argue he had insufficient notice of the Estateâ€™s summary judgment motion.Â  Moreover, Johnson failed to appeal the trial courtâ€™s decision that Rule 8(c), SCRCP, precluded Johnson from arguing duress or coercion.Â  Also, we hold the trial court properly held Rule 8(c), SCRCP, requires duress or coercion to be specifically pled when a party submits a reply.Â  Finally, we conclude the trial court did not prematurely grant summary judgment.Â  For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE, WILLIAMS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-003","title":"State v.

Bell, of St. George, and James B. Richardson, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Raymond Thomas appeals from a judgment granting Kenneth and Shannon Steinbronn damages for breach of contract.[1]Â  Thomas contends the trial court erred in (1) holding the trial in his absence without proper notice while a motion to be relieved as counsel was still pending, (2) awarding damages beyond the prayer sought in the complaint, and (3) in removing a mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  We affirm.[2]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn July 28, 2003, Raymond Thomas (d/b/a All-in-One Construction) filed a notice and certificate of mechanicâ€™s lien in the amount of $39,026.39 for property located at 169 Fisk Road in Dorchester County.Â  Thomas, on October 9, 2003, initiated an action to foreclose on this mechanicâ€™s lien and an action for breach of contract.Â  The complaint alleged that Kenneth and Shannon Steinbronn breached their contract with Thomas to build their home.Â  The Steinbronns counterclaimed for breach of contract seeking unspecified damages, alleging that Thomasâ€™s work was neither up to code nor in compliance with contract specifications.Â  \r\nDue to the fact that Thomas failed and refused to bring his account current despite repeated billings, his attorney, W. Scott Palmer, moved to be relieved as counsel on June 9, 2004.Â  On August 26, 2004, the court granted this motion.Â Â Â  \r\nOn September 10, 2004, the Steinbronnsâ€™ attorney sent Thomas notice, by regular and certified mail to his home address, that the trial was scheduled for September 27, 2004.Â  Neither the receipt for the certified mail nor the letter sent via regular mail was returned to the Steinbronnsâ€™ attorney.Â  \r\nThe case was tried on September 27, 2004, and neither Thomas nor any representative for him attended.Â  Mrs. Steinbronn testified as to the agreement entered into with Thomas to build her home.Â  The total contract cost was $176,800 to be financed by Farmers and Merchants Bank (Bank).Â  The Bank allowed the Steinbronns to make draws under the loan, and then pay Thomas and the sub-contractors directly.Â  Mrs. Steinbronn further testified that payment under the first draw immediately produced a problem when Thomas admitted he erred and overcharged her for building materials.Â  According to Mrs. Steinbronn, there were a myriad of problems with Thomasâ€™s workmanship, including:Â  the staircase had to be rebuilt 3 times, there were no hurricane clips or straps, the roof was not completely braced, the vents on the porch were improper, termite pre-treatment was not completed, there was insufficient block and brick support for the porches, 2 x 8 ceiling boards had more than the maximum one-third of their width cut out, ceiling joists were crooked and not nailed properly, and all the plumbing had to be replaced.Â Â Â  \r\nThe Steinbronns fired Thomas and hired a different contractor who they paid to repair and complete the house.Â  Thomasâ€™s mechanicâ€™s lien delayed the Steinbronnsâ€™ ability to attain permanent financing on their home.Â  The Steinbronns paid more than $11,000 in additional interest on the construction loan, as they missed out on lower permanent financing interest rates which had recently increased.Â  The contractor who finished the house and the Steinbronnsâ€™ loan officer supported Mrs. Steinbronnâ€™s testimony.Â  \r\nMrs. Steinbronn testified that she and her husband paid $85,075.63 above the originally contracted amount to complete their house. The trial court entered judgment for the Steinbronns in this amount and ordered cancellation of Thomasâ€™s mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  Pursuant to Rule 60(b), SCRCP, Thomas filed an unsuccessful motion to alter or amend the trial courtâ€™s decision.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA decision to grant or deny a motion under Rule 60(b), SCRCP, is within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Bowman v. Bowman, 357 S.C. 146, 151, 591 S.E.2d 654, 656 (Ct. App. 2004) (citing Coleman v. Dunlap, 306 S.C. 491, 413 S.E.2d 15 (1992)).Â  On review, we are limited to determining whether the trial court abused its discretion in granting or denying the motion.Â  Bowman, 357 S.C. at 151, 591 S.E.2d at 656.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Notice of Trial\r\nThomas contends the trial court erred in holding the trial in his absence because he had not received notice.Â  We disagree.\r\nThomas claims that he did not receive notice of the September 27, 2004 hearing because he was in Florida from August 22, 2004, until October 29, 2004, repairing hurricane damage.Â  Evidently, neither he nor anyone else was monitoring his mail.Â  He also claims that when he returned, he did not find the notice in his accumulated mail.Â  On November 15, 2004, in an order responding to Thomasâ€™s motion to alter or amend, the trial court found:\r\n\r\nPlaintiff [Appellant] brought this suit.Â  He has a duty to timely prosecute it.Â  More particularly, he has a duty to tell the Clerk and other parties when he will be unavailable for trial.Â  Nothing in the record indicates he sought protection for the time he was out of state.\r\n\r\nWe agree.Â  A party has a duty to monitor the progress of his case, and lack of familiarity with legal proceedings is unacceptable, as the court will not hold a layman to any lesser standard than is applied to an attorney.Â  Goodson v. American Bankers Insurance Company of Florida, 295 S.C. 400, 403, 368 S.E.2d 687, 689 (Ct. App. 1988). \r\nThomas further argues that he did not receive notice because the Steinbronnsâ€™ attorney errantly sent notice of the trial to him and not to his attorney of record.Â  This argument was not part of Thomasâ€™s Rule 60 motion and is thus not preserved for appeal.Â  See \r\nFirst Union Nat. Bank of South Carolina v. Soden, 333 S.C. 554, 568, 511 S.E.2d 372, 379 (Ct. App. 1998) (where an issue has not been ruled upon by the trial judge nor raised in a post-trial motion,\r\nsuch issue may not be considered on appeal).Â  The argument is, in any event, without merit.Â  Thomas asserts that at the time the trial occurred on September 27, 2004, the motion from his attorney to be relieved as counsel was still pending.Â  This is not the case.Â  The record clearly reflects that the trial court granted Palmerâ€™s motion to be relieved as counsel on August 26, 2004.Â  At the time the notice of trial was sent, Thomas was acting pro se.Â  As the case is presented to us, mailing notice to Thomas at his correct address cannot be considered improper.Â  It is readily apparent that the arguments advanced by Thomas in his final brief are based on the misunderstanding that the motion to relieve his counsel was still pending as of the date of the trial.Â  Thomas, through counsel, acknowledges this error in the reply brief.\r\nII.Â  Damages\r\nThomas contends that the trial court erred in awarding damages beyond the prayer sought in the complaint.Â  We disagree.[3]Â  The award does not exceed the prayer for damages.Â  The Steinbronns asked for damages in an amount â€œover $58,000â€ and for â€œactual â€¦ damages in an amount to be determined by the court.â€Â  The suggestion that the damage award exceeds the amount prayed for in the complaint is simply not true.\r\nIII.Â  Mechanicâ€™s Lien\r\nThomas contends that the trial court erred in removing the mechanicâ€™s lien when it was not requested in the pleadings and no amendment was requested at trial.Â  We disagree.Â  This issue may not be preserved for appeal, but if preserved, we find no error by the trial court.[4]Â  \r\nThomas essentially abandoned his complaint (which included a claim to enforce his mechanicâ€™s lien) and failed to appear at the trial.Â  He cannot now be heard to complain that the court ruled against him on his complaint or cry foul because the trial court did not hold his claim in abeyance.Â  We believe that the trial courtâ€™s decision to dissolve the mechanics lien was ministerial and a consequence of resolving all issues before the court.Â  We find no error.Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThis court finds that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in holding the trial in Thomasâ€™s absence after finding that he had received proper notice, after his former counsel had been relieved pursuant to court order. Â We further find that the trial court did not err in its damages award or in dissolving Thomasâ€™s mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  Based on the foregoing, the trial courtâ€™s order is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Thomasâ€™s appellate counsel did not represent Thomas in the trial court.\r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3] One feature of Thomasâ€™s argument here is that the judgment rendered in favor of the Steinbronns is in essence a default judgment, and, therefore, damages cannot exceed the prayer for relief.Â  This specific argument was not raised in Thomasâ€™s Rule 60 motion.Â  In fact, the â€œdefault judgmentâ€ argument surfaced for the first time in Thomasâ€™s reply brief.Â  A party may not properly raise an issue for the first time in his reply brief.Â  We are, then, presented with another argument that is not preserved for review.Â  In any event, the Steinbronns never sought to invoke Rule 55, SCRCP, and hold Thomas in default for his failure to file a reply to their counterclaim.Â Â  The Steinbronns never changed the initial posture of the caseâ€”as commenced by Thomasâ€”and they pursued a trial. We adhere to the view that a partyâ€™s failure to appear for trial does not transform the proceeding into a default hearing.Â  Besides, in the context of a default status, Rule 55 requires â€œat least 3 days priorâ€ notice and Rule 55(b)(2) of the SCRCP states, â€œPursuant to Rule 5(a), notice of any trial or hearing on unliquidated damages shall also be given to parties in default by first class mail to the last known address of such party.â€Â  Notice of the hearingâ€”whether treated as a trial or a default hearingâ€”was properly given to Thomas at his correct address approximately two weeks in advance.Â  Thus, this newly asserted ground that Thomas was in default for failure to reply to the counterclaim provides no basis for relief in this court.Â Â Â  \r\n[4] Thomas does not specifically refer to the mechanicâ€™s lien in his post trial motion to alter or amend, but the motion does note that â€œno credit was given for the amount due to the plaintiff.â€Â  This appears to be in reference to the money owed under the mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-008","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Sally W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General David Spencer, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Warren Blair Giese, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Robert M. Dudek, Â of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n PER CURIAM: The State appeals the circuit courtâ€™s acceptance of Henry Poplinâ€™s plea of autrefois convict[1] regarding a charge of Assault and Battery With Intent to Kill (ABWIK).Â  Specifically, the State argues that a preceding PCR order vacated all convictions that were part of a prior plea agreement, allowing the state to retry Poplin on all prior charges.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn December 1999, Poplin and an acquaintance entered â€œRough Draft,â€ a bar in Columbiaâ€™s Five Points area.Â  Poplinâ€™s companion was apparently banned from the establishment, and the pair was asked to vacate the premises.Â  According to Poplin, although escorted out in a rough manner, they left peacefully.Â  Once outside, however, Poplin realized that he left a drink inside and reentered the bar.Â  The establishmentâ€™s manager noticed Poplinâ€™s reentry and an altercation ensued.Â  Poplin, who was allegedly brandishing a small knife, stabbed the manager several times and attempted to flee.Â  He was apprehended by local citizens and held until his arrest by law enforcement.\r\nIn March 2000, Poplin was indicted for Assault and Battery With Intent to Kill (ABWIK) and Possession of a Firearm or Knife During Commission of or Attempt to Commit a Violent Crime.Â  Because of a prior ABWIK charge, he faced a mandatory sentence of life without the possibility of parole pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 (2003).Â  Poplin communicated to his trial counsel that he desired to enter a plea to the charges if he could avoid a life sentence.Â  Counsel then vigorously pursued a plea agreement with the State that would avoid a conviction for a second â€œmost serious offenseâ€ and a mandatory life sentence.Â  After much negotiation, the State offered a plea agreement.Â  The offer allowed Poplin to avoid a second ABWIK conviction if he agreed to plead guilty to the following charges:\r\n\r\n1. One count of Assault and Battery of a High and Aggravated Nature (ABHAN) as a lesser included offense of the ABWIK charge.\r\n2. An additional count of ABHAN.\r\n3. One count of Second Degree Burglary. \r\n4. One count of Possession of Tools to be Employed in a Crime.\r\n5.Â  One count of Possession of a Firearm or Knife During the Commission of a Violent Crime.\r\n\r\nA guilty plea to all the above charges exposed Poplin to a possible 45 years of incarceration.Â  Defense counsel attempted to negotiate a lighter sentence for her client, but was told by the State that â€œthis is a way to get him the amount of time we think he deservesâ€ and â€œ[its] either trial or 45.â€\r\nPoplinâ€™s trial counsel informed him that some of the charges were â€œquestionable,â€ but that his only options were to either take the deal or go to trial and face a possible life sentence.Â  He pled guilty to all the charges and received consecutive sentences totaling 45 years imprisonment.\r\nPoplin did not appeal the guilty plea.Â  Shortly after sentencing, however, he filed an application for PCR, alleging, inter alia, that his plea counsel was ineffective for failing to inform him of his right to appeal and failing to explain the possibility that several of the indictments placed him in double jeopardy for a single criminal act.Â  The PCR application, it is important to note, challenged only four of the five convictions and did not mention the initial indictment for ABWIK, which, as part of the deal, was pled down to a guilty plea for the lesser included offense of ABHAN.Â  In November 2001, Poplin received a hearing before the circuit court on his PCR claims.\r\nAt the hearing, the range of possible relief available to Poplin was discussed often and to a substantial degree of detail.Â  Early in the proceedings, the State addressed the issue and the following exchange took place:\r\n\r\nThe State:Â  I want to just make sure I understand for the record what relief the applicant is seeking today.\r\nThe Court:Â  I guess he wants a new trial but specifically . . .\r\nThe State:Â  The, your honor, I understand that . . . the appropriate relief would be a new trial on all the charges . . .\r\nPCR Counsel:Â  Your honor, the applicant would like to ask that the court consider vacating one of the assault and battery charges, one of the weapon charges, and the burglary charge for lack of a factual basis, leaving intact what the applicant concedes heâ€™s guilty of, which is one count of [ABHAN] and a single weapons charge.Â  However, I have explained to him on a previous visit to his correctional institution that it may well be the position of the State that the pleas were entered part and parcel of a negotiated plea bargain and that any effort to undermine the integrity of the pleas on these counts would likely result in vacation of all the judgments and sentences, at which point I believe he would face prosecution on the original indictment for [ABWIK] and Iâ€™m prepared to question him concerning that decision on the stand.\r\n\r\nFollowing this exchange, Poplin testified that he was fully aware the circuit could vacate all the sentences involved in the plea bargain and that the â€œprobable resultâ€ of his PCR action would be a new indictment on the original charge of ABWIK, a charge he knew could result in a life sentence.Â  On cross-examination, Poplin conceded that his guilty plea was, in fact, â€œa package deal . . . in lieu of going to trial.â€\r\nFollowing the presentation of Poplinâ€™s case, the State moved for a directed verdict on the following grounds:\r\n\r\nâ€œThe basis is that the relief sought today is to throw out some charges and not others.Â  I mean, I think even Mr. Poplinâ€™s own testimony makes clear he understood this was a package deal.Â  The only relief available is a trial on all the charges.â€\r\n\r\nIn a one-word response, the circuit court denied the Stateâ€™s directed verdict motion.Â  Following this denial, Poplinâ€™s PCR counsel clarified his position:\r\n\r\nâ€œI would like to make clear that my client has stated that while the first option [vacation of just the four disputed convictions] would be his preference, he is willing to accept the option, the relief, if you will, of a new trial on everything.â€\r\n\r\nThe circuit court allowed each party to submit their closing arguments in the form of proposed orders.Â  After consideration of the proposed orders, the circuit court found Poplinâ€™s double jeopardy claims persuasive.Â  In its order, the circuit court stated 1) â€œit is clear that the Applicant could not be prosecuted and punished twice for the same assaultâ€ and 2) â€œ[t]his court further finds that punishment for possession of a weapon during a violent crime and for possession of tools to be used in a crime likewise violates the Applicantâ€™s rights against double jeopardy where the â€˜toolâ€™ alleged by the one indictment was the same â€˜weaponâ€™ alleged in the other.â€Â  Because Poplin was not mindful of his double jeopardy claims when he waived the defense, the court found that his plea counsel failed to adequately advise him of the nature and consequences of the pleas.Â  The order concludes with the following rather vague ruling:\r\n\r\nâ€œFor all the reasons set forth above, this Application for Post-Conviction Relief is hereby granted.Â  The Applicantâ€™s case is to be remanded to the Richland County Court of General Sessions for a new trial.â€\r\n\r\nThe order does not specifically address whether it vacates the entirety of Poplinâ€™s negotiated plea or just those convictions brought into question by his double jeopardy claims.Â  \r\nThe State petitioned the South Carolina Supreme Court for writ of certiorari regarding the PCR ruling on the basis that Defendant was generally aware of the consequences of either accepting the plea agreement or going to trial.Â  The petition was denied.Â  Shortly after the denial of the Stateâ€™s petition, Defendant was recharged on the original indictment for ABWIK and its mandatory life sentence.Â  In January 2004, the case was brought to trial.\r\nPoplinâ€™s new counsel promptly entered a plea of autrefois convict, on the basis that one of Poplinâ€™s prior guilty pleas, the ABHAN charge brought as a lesser included offense of the original ABWIK, was not vacated by the PCR order.Â  The renewed ABWIK charge, therefore, was a clear violation of the double jeopardy clause.Â  According to defense counsel, Poplin was still serving a ten-year sentence for the ABHAN guilty plea; thus, he could not be tried for ABWIK based on the same criminal act.Â  Because Poplin had been in Richland County Detention Center, and not a typical correctional facility, some confusion arose as to whether or not he was, in fact, still serving a prison sentence.Â  The State argued that the PCR order vacated all sentences involved in the prior negotiated plea agreement and Poplin was being held like any other defendant awaiting trial.\r\nThe circuit court concluded that the State was prohibited from further proceeding against Poplin on the ABWIK charge because the initial sentence for ABHAN was not vacated by the PCR order.Â  This conclusion was based on the fact that Poplinâ€™s application for PCR did not challenge his conviction for ABHAN as a lesser-included offense of the initial ABWIK charge.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe State argues the PCR order vacated the entirety of Poplinâ€™s negotiated guilty plea, allowing the State to retry Poplin on the originally indicted charge of ABWIK.Â  We disagree.\r\nQuoting 46 Am.Jur.2d Judgments Â§ 73 (1969), the South Carolina Supreme Court outlined the rules for construing judgments in Eddins v. Eddins, 304 S.C. 133, 403 S.E.2d 164 (1991), as follows:\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, judgments are to be construed like other written instruments.Â  The determinative factor is the intention of the court, as gathered, not from an isolated part thereof, but from all parts of the judgment itself.Â  Hence, in construing a judgment, it should be examined and considered in its entirety.Â  Such construction should be given to a judgment as will give force and effect to every word of it, if possible, and make it as a whole consistent and reasonable.Â  In applying this rule, effect must be given to that which is unavoidably and necessarily implied in a judgment, as well as to that which is expressed in the most appropriate language.\r\n\r\nId. at 135-36, 403 S.E.2d at 166.\r\nIn the present case, the PCR courtâ€™s order initially recounts the entirety of Poplinâ€™s package guilty plea, but, whether purposefully or by accidental omission, lists only one of the ABHAN convictions when reviewing the sentences before it.Â  Furthermore, the PCR court stated its granted relief as â€œthis Application for Post-Conviction Relief is hereby granted.â€Â Â  Poplinâ€™s application for PCR raises only four of the five convictions.Â  The application, expressly granted by the circuit court, lacks any mention of the initial ABHAN charge.Â  In fact, in the memorandum in support of his PCR claims, Poplin expressly states that he is not challenging his conviction on the ABHAN charged as a lesser-included offense of\r\nABWIK. \r\nA review of the record on appeal, though in no way conclusive, also reveals evidence supporting the circuit courtâ€™s interpretation of the PCR order.Â  The Stateâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on the basis that all the charges must be vacated together was promptly denied.[2]Â  Although the entire negotiated plea was openly discussed at the PCR hearing, as well as the very likely scenario that all the pleas would be vacated, Poplin made clear that the primary relief sought from the circuit court was a new trial on only the four guilty pleas raised in his application.Â  At no point during the hearing did Poplin concede his only possible relief would be a new trial on all charges.\r\nâ€œIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.â€ Â State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  Thus, we are bound by the circuit courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  Id.Â  In the case before us, we find no articulable error of law in the circuit courtâ€™s interpretation of the PCR order.Â  Despite the fact that the issue of proper relief was extensively discussed at the PCR hearing, the circuit court was faced with an enigmatic PCR order which failed to address the issue.Â  While it would certainly not offend reason to reach an opposite conclusion to that of the circuit court, neither the PCR order itself, nor the record on appeal, conclusively reveals the PCR court intended to vacate the entire negotiated plea.Â  Although we may have construed the PCR order differently, the circuit courtâ€™s interpretation is supported by evidence both in the order itself and the record on appeal and, thus, is not a â€œclearly erroneousâ€ construction of the order.Â  \r\nThe State contends that this construction of the PCR order renders the judgment meaningless because the order expressly remands Poplinâ€™s case for a new trial.Â  We are not persuaded by this argument.Â  Although the fact that Poplin is presently serving a ten-year sentence for ABHAN certainly prevents the State from pursuing an additional conviction on the initial ABWIK indictment, the PCR order, as construed by the circuit court, vacated both guilty pleas to possession of a weapon during a violent crime and possession of tools to be used in a crime as dual prosecutions for a singular criminal act.Â  There is nothing preventing the State from prosecuting Poplin on the possession of tools to be used in a crime charge; thus, the orderâ€™s remand for a new trial is not rendered meaningless.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the circuit courtâ€™s order is\r\n AFFIRMED.  \r\n STILWELL, KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] â€œA plea in bar of arraignment that the defendant has been convicted of the offense.â€Â  Blacks Law Dictionary 130 (7th ed. 1999).\r\n[2] We note that the proper motion in this situation, as PCR actions are civil in nature, would be a motion for nonsuit pursuant to Rule 41, SCRCP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-014","title":"Ware v.

Lacy and Suzanne C. Boulware, both of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\n        KathrynÂ  Williams, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Tradesman International, Inc. and National Fire Insurance Company of Hartford (Appellants) appeal the decision of the circuit court affirming the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commissionâ€™s (the Commission) award of workerâ€™s compensation benefits to Isaac Ware.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nWare was employed by a temporary employment service as a â€œMIGâ€ welder at Tradesman.Â  As part of his employment, he had to move pieces of steel in order to set up jigs for welding.Â  While moving steel to a jig on June 25, 2001, Ware felt a â€œpullâ€ in his lower left groin area.Â  He experienced pain when this occurred, and as a result, he dropped the piece of steel he was carrying.Â  He remained at work for the rest of the day, but had to get a coworker to move the pieces of steel to the jig for him.Â  Ware returned to work the next day and tried to work as usual.Â  He was in more pain than he had been in the day before, and again his coworker had to move the pieces of steel to the jig for him.Â  After a couple of hours of work, Ware decided he could not continue and spoke to his supervisor about the situation. \r\nWare told his supervisor that he thought he may have a hernia.Â  His supervisor advised him to call Tradesman International.Â  Ware explained the situation to Tradesman and advised them that he was going to see his family physician, Dr. Kevin Smith.Â  Tradesman requested that he also see a doctor at Doctorâ€™s Care.\r\nWare went to see Dr. Smith first and then, on the same day, went to Doctorâ€™s Care and saw Dr. Peter Manos.Â  During his visit with Dr. Smith on June 26, 2001, Ware explained the events and pain that lead to him seeking treatment.Â  He also told Dr. Smith that he had noticed a slight swelling in his lower left groin approximately ten days prior to feeling the â€œpullâ€ while moving the steel at work.Â  Based on an examination, Dr. Smith diagnosed Ware as having a left inguinal hernia.Â  Ware was given the same diagnosis by Dr. Manos at Doctorâ€™s Care.Â  On February 08, 2002, Dr. Manos specifically stated that Wareâ€™s hernia was caused by â€œlifting a heavy object at work on June 25, 2001.â€ \r\nOn July 19, 2001, Dr. Benjamin Risinger, a general surgeon, performed surgery on Ware to repair his hernia.Â  Hours after the surgery, Ware started bleeding and experiencing severe pain, and he had to be transported by ambulance to the emergency room.Â  Due to postoperative bleeding and a massive scrotal hematoma with a probable testicular artery injury,Â  Ware underwent a second surgery the following day. Â Ware has experienced pain, depression, severe anger, and loss of sexual function as result of his injuries.Â  Â Â Â Ware has not been able to return to work since June 27, 2001.Â  \r\nOn September 6, 2001, Ware filed a Form 50, seeking compensation for his injuries, treatment, and lost wages.Â  On October 22, 2002, the Single Commissioner found that on June 26, 2001, Ware sustained an injury from an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment, resulting in a hernia.Â  The Single Commissioner also found that the hernia did not exist before the accident.Â  He ordered the Appellants to pay Ware for all causally related medical treatment and expenses and to pay Ware $313.26 per week for all periods of total disability from June 25, 2001 until further order or agreement.Â  The Appellants appealed the Single Commissionerâ€™s decision to the Commission.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nOn June 17, 2003, the Commission unanimously affirmed the Order of the Single Commissioner.Â  Thereafter, the Appellants appealed the Commissionâ€™s decision to the circuit court.Â  On November 5, 2004, the circuit court affirmed the Commissionâ€™s decision.Â  This appeal followed.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission. Â S.C.Code Ann.Â Â  Â§1-23-380 (2005); Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 132, 276 S.E.2d 304, 305 (1981). Â â€œThe appellate courtâ€™s review is limited to deciding whether the commissionâ€™s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law.â€ Â Hendricks v. Pickens County, 335 S.C. 405, 411, 517 S.E.2d 698, 701 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Substantial evidence is â€œnot a mere scintilla of evidence nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached or must have reached in order to justify its action.â€&nbsp; Miller by Miller v. State Roofing Co., 312 S.C. 452, 454, 441 S.E.2d 323, 324-25 (1994) (quoting Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981)). \r\nâ€œA judgment upon which reasonable men might differ will not be set aside.â€ Â Toddâ€™s Ice Cream, Inc. v. South Carolina Employment Sec. Commâ€™n, 281 S.C. 254, 258, 315 S.E.2d 373, 375 (Ct. App. 1984). Â The final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the Commission. Â Ross v. American Red Cross, 298 S.C. 490, 492, 381 S.E.2d 728, 730 (1989). Â The reviewing court may not â€œsubstitute its judgment for that of the [Commission] as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(6) (2005). Â â€œWhere there is a conflict in the evidence, either of different witnesses or of the same witnesses, the findings of fact of the Commission as triers of fact are conclusive.â€Â Â  Hoxit v. Michelin Tire Corp., 304 S.C. 461, 465, 405 S.E.2d 407, 409 (1991).Â  \r\nIn order for a hernia to be a compensable injury under workersâ€™ compensation in South Carolina, a claimant must prove: 1) that there was an injury resulting in a hernia or a rupture; 2) that the injury or rupture appeared suddenly; 3) that it was accompanied by pain; 4) that the hernia or rupture immediately followed an accident; and 5) that the hernia or rupture did not exist prior to the accident.Â Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-40 (1976).Â  We find there was substantial evidence presented to satisfy all five elements of the statute. Â Â Â \r\nWare testified that while he was moving steel to a jig on June 25, 2001, he felt a â€œpullâ€ in his lower left groin area.Â  Ware experienced pain when this occurred, and as a result, he dropped the piece of steel he was carrying.Â  Additionally, Ware testified that he initially noticed the injury the day of the accident.Â  Dr. Smith testified that Ware told him on the day of the accident that the swelling in his lower left groin was hurting.Â  Dr. Smith also stated that lifting or straining can cause hernias.Â  Most importantly, the Appellantâ€™s own doctor, Dr. Manos, specifically stated that Wareâ€™s hernia was caused by â€œlifting a heavy object at work on June 25, 2001.â€Â  Tradesmanâ€™s general manager for Greenville testified that prior to June 25, 2001, Ware had not experienced problems performing his work activities.Â  However, Ware testified that as soon as he felt the â€œpull,â€ he experienced pain and had difficultly working.Â  Thus, there is substantial evidence that Ware suffered an injury resulting in a hernia, the hernia appeared suddenly, it was accompanied by pain, and it immediately followed an accident that occurred while Ware was pulling steel at work.Â  See Eaddy v. Smurfit-Stone Container Corp., 355 S.C. 154, 161- 62, 584 S.E.2d 390, 394 (Ct. App. 2003).Â Â  \r\nThe Appellants contend that Ware failed to satisfy the final element of S.C. Code Ann. Â§42-9-40 (1976), which requires that the hernia or rupture did not exist prior to the accident.Â  It is undisputed that Ware told Dr. Smith he had noticed swelling in his lower left groin up to 10 days prior to June 25, 2001.Â Â  Based on this, Dr. Smith opined that the hernia was present before the accident on June 25, 2001.Â  However, the Appellantâ€™s own doctor, Dr. Manos, specifically stated that Wareâ€™s hernia was caused by â€œlifting a heavy object at work on June 25, 2001.â€Â  Both doctors saw Ware in the hours following the accident, and both doctors reached different conclusions on when his hernia first occurred.Â  â€œWhere there is a conflict in the evidence, either of different witnesses or of the same witnesses, the findings of fact of the Commission as triers of fact are conclusive.â€Â Â  Hoxit, 304 S.C. at 465, 405 S.E.2d at 409.Â  Therefore, the Commissionâ€™s findings on the timing and the cause of the hernia are conclusive.Â  Accordingly, the order of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-015","title":"Watts Construction Company v.

Watts for the construction of a new residence for the purchase price of $175,000 with a $17,500 initial deposit.Â  The contract included allowances for lighting, hardware, flooring (tile, hardwood, and carpet), fixtures, windows, a heat and air system, two garage doors with openers, cabinetry, certain ceiling heights, brick and vinyl exterior, and countertops.Â  The contract also stipulated â€œ[t]here will be no occupancy until all work has been completed and all costs have been paid.â€Â  As to any â€œchanges [desired by the Feltes] during the period in which the home [was] being constructed,â€ the contract provides â€œall extras [are to] be charged and billed to [the Feltes] at the time the changes are complete.â€Â  An employee of Watts Construction composed the agreement on company letterhead.Â  The Feltes and Appellants signed the document.Â  A handwritten amendment to the contract was later added setting the closing date on the construction of the home for December 15, 1997.Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Construction began in the summer of 1997.Â  Throughout the construction process, Appellants made periodic draws against the Feltesâ€™ construction loan.Â  On December 11, 1997, the Feltes contacted their construction loan company and requested that Appellants not be allowed to make further draws on the account without their express approval.Â  At this point, the Feltes had paid Appellants a total of $135,000.Â  On December 16, 1997, the Feltes provided Appellants with a written inspectorâ€™s report and a letter citing the items that needed immediate attention for completion of the home.Â  â€œDue to lack of response and progress on the home,â€ the Feltes terminated the contract with Appellants on January 12, 1998.Â  \r\nAppellants brought a mechanicâ€™s lien foreclosure and breach of contract actions against the Feltes.Â  The Feltes counterclaimed for breach of contract and breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike service.Â  By consent of the parties, the mechanicâ€™s lien cause of action was dismissed.Â  The Master awarded the Feltes $153,505.23 for construction loan interest paid after December 15, 1997, costs incurred to complete the house, and â€œcost of repairs necessary to correct the defective workmanship.â€Â  This amount was to be offset by the $40,000 remaining due under the terms of the contract.Â  \r\nAppellants then filed a motion for new trial or amended judgment.Â  Appellants argued the following issues: (1) Daniel Watts should have been excluded from the award because the Feltes produced no evidence warranting piercing of the corporate veil to reach him as a party; (2) Appellants were prejudiced by the two month delay between the hearing dates; (3) Appellants deserved an award because the overwhelming evidence proves the Feltes breached the contract; and (4) in the alternative, the amount awarded should be reduced, including increasing the amount offset to encompass the overages.Â  \r\nThe Master found the first issue was not preserved, but that all evidence indicated â€œthe judgment should be entered against both Plaintiffs.â€Â  Noting his extensive review of his thirteen pages of notes from the first hearing prior to the second part of the trial, the Master found no prejudice to Appellants from the bifurcated trial.Â  Finally, the Master reduced the total judgment of $113,505.23 to $80,000.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action for breach of contract seeking money damages is an action at law.Â  Sterling Dev. Co. v. Collins, 309 S.C. 237, 240, 421 S.E.2d 402, 404 (1992).Â  In an action at law, tried without a jury, the appellate court standard of review extends only to the correction of errors of law.Â  Okatie River, L.L.C. v. Southeastern Site Prep, L.L.C., 353 S.C. 327, 334, 577 S.E.2d 468, 472&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).Â  The trial judgeâ€™s findings of fact will not be disturbed on appeal unless those findings are â€œwholly unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an erroneous conception or application of the law.â€Â  Maddux Supply Co. v. Safhi, Inc., 316 S.C. 404, 406, 450 S.E.2d 101, 102 (Ct. App. 1994). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants contend the Master erred in awarding the Feltes $80,000 for breach of contract and breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike service, or, in the alternative, in failing to set-off this award with the amounts attributable to the installation of the septic tank and the construction overages.Â  We disagree.\r\nÂ â€œA contract is an obligation which arises from actual agreement of the parties manifested by words, oral or written, or by conduct.â€ Â Roberts v. Gaskins, 327 S.C. 478, 483, 486 S.E.2d 771, 773 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  When a contract is clear and unambiguous, the construction of the contract is a question of law for the court. Â Conner v. Alvarez, 285 S.C. 97, 328 S.E.2d 334 (1985). Â In construing the terms of a contract, the foremost rule is that the court must give effect to the intentions of the parties by looking to the language of the contract. Â Id. at 101, 328 S.E.2d at 336. When the language of a contract is clear, explicit, and unambiguous, the language of the contract alone determines the contractâ€™s force and effect and the court must construe it according to its plain, ordinary, and popular meaning. Â Moser v. Gosnell,&nbsp;334 S.C. 425, 430, 513 S.E.2d 123, 125&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1999).\r\nA builder who contracts to construct a dwelling impliedly warrants that the work undertaken will be performed in a careful, diligent, and workmanlike manner.Â  See Hill v. Polar Pantries, 219 S.C. 263, 64 S.E.2d 885 (1951).Â  A builder also has a legal duty to undertake construction commensurate with industry standards.Â  Kennedy v. Columbia Lumber and Mfg. Co., Inc., 299 S.C. 335, 346, 384 S.E.2d 730, 737 (1989) (citing Terlinde v. Neely, 275 S.C. 395, 399, 271 S.E.2d 768, 770 (1980)).\r\nAccording to the amended contract, Appellants were responsible for completing construction of the home in a condition ready for occupancy by December 15, 1997.Â  Watts admitted that the agreement included an obligation to complete construction, as evidenced by the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.Â  In order to receive the certificate of occupancy, the house had to have electricity, a septic system, and plumbing with connected water.Â  \r\nAccording to the Feltes, Appellants still had not installed the carpet, completed painting, or repaired defective brick work by the contractâ€™s deadline, December 15.Â  Furthermore, Appellantsâ€™ poor grading of the land caused the Feltesâ€™ septic system permit to be revoked.Â  Appellants contend they did not complete construction because the Feltes would not allow them to take a draw from the construction loan.Â  However, the contract did not require the Feltes to pay draws to Watts during the construction of the house.Â  The contract only required that the Feltes make an initial payment of $17, 500 and pay the balance of the construction price upon completion of the house.Â  Â \r\nAfter Appellants breached the contract by not completing it by the December 15 deadline, the Feltes gave Appellants additional time (more than a month) to complete a list of unsatisfactory or incomplete items.Â  However, these specified items were not completed.Â  Furthermore, several experts the in construction of residential houses testified that Appellantsâ€™ construction of the home substantially deviated from the industry standard.Â  Though their inspections cited numerous problems with the interior of the home, the majority of the inspections focused on the deficiency of the brick work.Â  The brick work problems included â€œtoo many problems with the mortar joint width, damaged brick, . . . chipped, broken out areas, mortar not matching, flashing omitted, which is a code violation.â€Â  According to the construction experts, the quality of the brick work was below the standard that would be acceptable in the home construction industry.Â  The construction experts also stated that the tiling, staining of the trim, and installation of the windows and cabinets were substandard.Â  \r\nThe Master had the benefit of hearing and observing the witnesses in this case; in addition, he inspected and personally observed the construction project in dispute.Â  Diamond Swimming Pool Co. v. Broome, 252 S.C. 379, 383, 166 S.E.2d 308, 310 (1969).Â  Based on more than sufficient evidence in the record to support the Masterâ€™s finding of a breach of contract and breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike service, we affirm the Masterâ€™s decision as to the $80,000 award to the Feltes.Â Â Â  \r\nAppellants argue damages should be reduced by the amount used to install the septic tank and the amount Watts spent on construction overages.Â  We disagree.\r\nMark Burgess, an expert in home construction, estimated that to complete construction of the home and repair the substandard work would cost in the proximity of $143,801.79.Â  While this amount includes the cost of the installation of the septic system, which is not covered in the contract, there is no dispute that DHEC revoked the septic tank permit because of Appellantsâ€™ improper grading of the land.Â  Appellants also claim they are entitled to a $6,360.38 offset of the overage charges for extras added by the Feltes after the contract was signed.Â  We find the Master effectively took out the cost of installing the septic tank and offset the overages by lowering the damage award by $33,505.23. \r\nAppellants claim the Master erred in failing to dismiss Donald Watts as a party in this action.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œIt is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.â€Â  Ellie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 102, 594 S.E.2d 485, 498 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œA party cannot for the first time raise an issue by way of a Rule 59(e) motion which could have been raised at trial.â€Â  Patterson v. Reid&nbsp;, 318 S.C. 183, 185, 456 S.E.2d 436, 437&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995).Â  The first time Appellants raise this issue was in the Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration.Â  Therefore, as the Master concluded, this issue was not timely raised and is not preserved for our review.Â  \r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the Masterâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED.

Holmes, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\n        F. Barron Grier, III and Lauri S. Darwin, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Jesse D. Smith brought causes of action against Youngâ€™s Food Stores for negligence and gross negligence arising from injuries he sustained while performing work at a Youngâ€™s store.Â  The circuit court held Smith was a statutory employee whose sole remedy was under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act and dismissed the case.Â  Smith appeals the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  We affirm.Â Â Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nBetween the fall of 1998 and the fall of 2001, Smith, d/b/a J &amp; J Smith Contracting, contracted with Youngâ€™s Food Stores to perform paint and maintenance work at Youngâ€™s stores located in the Midlands and Pee Dee regions of South Carolina.Â  Smith performed work on about thirty-seven Youngâ€™s stores. Â Smithâ€™s work included remodeling, painting, flooring, and roofing. Â During this period, Smith worked â€œmostly . . . all for Youngâ€™sâ€ and considered the Youngâ€™s work â€œpretty full time.â€ Â Full-time employees of Youngâ€™s, including maintenance employee Andy Smith, did some of the same work and often worked alongside Smith.Â  \r\nOn August 14, 2001, Smith was working at Youngâ€™s store #6.Â  Smith was attempting to prepare the area he was to paint when he placed his hand on a metal gable and received an electric shock.Â  As a result of the shock, Smith claims he suffered physical injury, pain, lost wages, medical bills, loss of consortium, and loss of enjoyment of life.Â  Smith brought causes of action for negligence and gross negligence against Youngâ€™s.Â  \r\nAt trial, Youngâ€™s moved to dismiss the case arguing Smithâ€™s action was barred by the exclusivity provision of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act because Smith qualified as a statutory employee.Â  Smith argued he was not a statutory employee because the work he performed was not an integral part of Youngâ€™s business.Â  The trial court held Smith was a statutory employee of Youngâ€™s and his exclusive remedy was through the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  Accordingly, the trial court dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction. Â This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œCoverage under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act depends on the existence of an employment relationship.â€Â  Edens v. Bellini, 359 S.C. 433, 439, 597 S.E.2d 863, 866 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œWhether or not an employer-employee relationship exists is a jurisdictional question.â€ Nelson v. Yellow Cab Co., 349 S.C. 589, 594, 564 S.E.2d 110, 112 (2002).Â  â€œThe determination of whether a worker is a statutory employee is jurisdictional and therefore the question on appeal is one of law.â€ Â Harrell v. Pineland Plantation, Ltd., 337 S.C. 313, 320, 523 S.E.2d 766, 769 (1999).Â  But, the exclusivity provision of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act is procedural in nature and does not involve subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Saab v. South Carolina State University, 350 S.C. 416, 423, 567 S.E.2d 231, 234 (2002). Â Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSmith argues the trial court erred in dismissing his negligence claim on the basis that the exclusivity provision of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act barred his negligence claim as he was a statutory employee of Youngâ€™s.Â  Smith asserts that the statutory employee portion of the Act does not apply to him because he was a subcontractor rather than an employee of a subcontractor.Â  This issue is not preserved for our review.Â  \r\nâ€œ[A]n issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998). Â A party may not argue one ground at trial and another on appeal.Â  State v. McCray, 332 S.C. 536, 542, 506 S.E.2d 301, 303 (1998) (citing State v. Byram, 326 S.C. 107, 485 S.E.2d 360 (1997)).Â  \r\nAt trial, Smith contended he was not a statutory employee because he did not meet the criteria for determining whether a worker qualifies as a statutory employee for purposes of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  Smith argued the work he performed, painting a sign, was not an integral part of the business of selling â€œsoda pop, cigarettes and things like that,â€ so the exclusively provision of the workersâ€™ compensation act did not bar his negligence action.Â  SeeÂ  Boone v. Huntington and Guerry Elec. Co.&nbsp; 311 S.C. 550, 553, 430 S.E.2d 507, 509&nbsp;(1993); Carter v. Florentine Corp., Inc.&nbsp; 310 S.C. 228, 231, 423 S.E.2d 112, 113&nbsp;(1992) (Three tests are applied in determining whether an employee of a subcontractor is a statutory employee of the owner: (1) is the activity an important part of the ownerâ€™s business; (2) is the activity a necessary, essential, integral part of the business; and (3) has the identical activity been performed by employees of the principal employer?).Â  On appeal Smith argues statutory employee section of the Act does not apply to him because he is the subcontractor and not an employee of the subcontractor.Â  Because Smith argues a different ground on appeal than he argued at trial, the issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  Accordingly, the order of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and SHORT, JJ. concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-017","title":"Whitlock v.

Miller, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-017\r\nSubmitted December 1, 2005 â€“ Filed January 11, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        C. Roland Jones, Jr., of Spartanburg, for Appellants.\r\n        Alton L. Martin, of Greenville and John P. Griffith, both of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Finley Siding and Auto Owners Insurance Company (Appellants) appeal the decision of the circuit court affirming the Appellant Panel of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commissionâ€™s (Full Commission) award of benefits to Wayne Whitlock.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn March 2000, Whitlock suffered an injury to his neck while in the course and scope of his employment at Finley Siding.Â  He reported the accident to his employer, who referred Whitlock to a chiropractor, Dr. Kolarik, and paid for his medical treatment.Â  Whitlock also saw his family doctor, Dr. Landrum McCarrell, who prescribed him pain medication.Â  \r\nOn December 17, 2001, Whitlock suffered a second work related injury.Â  Whitlock was carrying a large ladder when he stepped into a hole and jarred his shoulders, neck, and lower back.Â  Whitlock continued to work, but the burning pain worsened as the day progressed, so he reported the accident to Don Finley, the president of Finley Siding, the following day.Â  Finley again referred Whitlock to Dr. Kolarik and paid for the medical treatment.Â  Dr. Kolarik treated Whitlock for neck and shoulder pain, then Whitlock went on vacation and spent his time recuperating.\r\nWhitlock did not seek further medical treatment for the next few months because he did not have health insurance.Â  However, when work began to pick up in the Spring of 2002, the pain in Whitlockâ€™s neck, shoulder, and back increased.Â  Whitlock saw Dr. McCarrell who referred him for an MRI, which showed a bulging disc in his neck.Â  Then, Whitlock was referred to a neurologist, who noted that Whitlockâ€™s job was aggravating his symptoms.Â  Dr. McCarrell proscribed pain medication and recommended physical therapy.Â  \r\nWhitlock then notified his employer that he needed additional medical treatment and was referred to their workersâ€™ compensation insurance carrier, Auto Owners Insurance Company.Â  Auto Ownerâ€™s denied Whitlockâ€™s claim for additional treatment.Â  \r\nOn October 10, 2002, Whitlock filed a Form 50, seeking reimbursement for additional medical treatment.Â  Whitlock asserted that he had difficulty doing his job because of problems with his neck, shoulders, and back, and he remained in pain, which he treated with medication.Â  Don Finley conceded that Whitlock had reported the December 17, 2001 accident to him and that he authorized Whitlock to obtain medical treatment.Â  \r\nThe Single Commissioner found that Whitlock had a pre-exisiting arthritic condition in his back, and the accident caused a compensable aggravation to his condition.Â  The Single Commissioner ordered that Whitlock was entitled to reimbursement for future medical treatment and for causally-related medical treatment already incurred.Â  \r\nAppellants sought review of the decision by the Full Commission, which unanimously affirmed the Single Commissionerâ€™s decision and adopted his order verbatim.Â  Thereafter, Appellants appealed to the circuit court, arguing the Full Commissionâ€™s order was not supported by substantial evidence.Â  The circuit court affirmed the Full Commissionâ€™s order.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants argue the Full Commission erred in finding that Whitlock is entitled to future medical treatment for his back and shoulder because his on-going complaints stem from his accident on December 17, 2001. Â Appellants contend that any future treatment Whitlock may require is the result of his pre-existing arthritic condition rather than the accident.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â  1-23-380 (2005); Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 132, 276 S.E.2d 304, 305 (1981).Â  â€œThe appellate courtâ€™s review is limited to deciding whether the commissionâ€™s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law.â€Â  Hendricks v. Pickens County, 335 S.C. 405, 411, 517 S.E.2d 698, 701 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Substantial evidence is â€œnot a mere scintilla of evidence nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached or must have reached in order to justify its action.â€Â  Miller by Miller v. State Roofing Co., 312 S.C. 452, 454, 441 S.E.2d 323, 324-25 (1994) (quoting Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 136, 276 S.E.2d 304, 307 (1981)).Â  A court may reverse or modify an agencyâ€™s decision â€œâ€˜if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions are . . . affected by other error of law.â€™â€Â  Stephen v. Avins Const. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 337, 478 S.E.2d 74, 76 (Ct. App. 1996) (citations omitted).\r\nOur courts have clearly held that a work-related accident that aggravates or accelerates a pre-existing condition, infirmity, or disease is compensable.Â  Mullinax v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., 318 S.C. 431, 437, 458 S.E.2d 76, 79 (Ct. App. 1995); Brown v. R.L. Jordan Oil Co., 291 S.C. 272, 275, 353 S.E.2d 280, 282 (1987); Sturkie v. Ballenger Corp., 268 S.C. 536, 541, 235 S.E.2d 120, 122 (1977); Glover v. Columbia Hospital of Richland County, 236 S.C. 410, , 114 S.E.2d 565, 569 (1960) (a quiescent weakened, but not disabling condition accidentally aggravated, accelerated, or activated, with resulting disability, is compensable).Â  A condition is compensable unless it is due solely to the natural progression of a pre-existing condition.Â  Mullinax, 318 S.C. at 437, 458 S.E.2d at 80.Â  â€œIt is no defense that the accident, standing alone, would not have caused the claimantâ€™s condition, because the employer takes the employee as it finds him or her.â€Â  Brown, 291 S.C. at 275, 353 S.E.2d at 582.Â  Circumstantial evidence may be used to prove causation.Â  Mullinax, 318 S.C. at 437, 458 S.E.2d at 80.Â  Moreover, â€œâ€˜[t]he causal sequence . . . may be more indirect or complex, but as long as the causal connection is in fact present the compensability of the subsequent condition is beyond question.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting Arthur Larson, The Law of Workmenâ€™s Compensation Â§ 13.11(b) (1994)).\r\nThe Full Commission found that Whitlock had a pre-existing arthritic condition in his back but found Whitlockâ€™s testimony that the pain became unbearable as a result of the accident credible.Â  Whitlock testified that he missed more than ten days of work and was late on several occasions because he â€œhad to get the hurting to stop first.â€Â  Furthermore, the president of Finley Siding admitted that Whitlock reported the accident and sought treatment at the businessesâ€™ expense as a result.Â  \r\nThe medical evidence also supports the Full Commissionâ€™s finding that the accident caused a worsening in Whitlockâ€™s condition.Â  In his APA submissions, Whitlock presented a letter in which Dr. McCarrell stated that since the accident, Whitlock â€œhas had worsened pain and has had increasing need for pain medication and really intensification of his symptom complex.â€Â  Dr. McCarrell, who treated Whitlock before and after the accident, also asserted that he believed Whitlockâ€™s increased pain was the result of the December 17, 2001 accident.Â  Dr. McCarrell additionally opined that Whitlock will need continued medical treatment as a result of the accident, including physical therapy and pain medication.Â  \r\nTherefore, the Full Commissionâ€™s finding that Whitlock suffered a compensable aggravation of his injury and had not reached maximum medical improvement is supported by substantial evidence in the record.Â  We find no error in the Full Commissionâ€™s decision to award Whitlock benefits for additional medical treatment for his back and shoulder.Â  Accordingly, the order of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and SHORT, JJ. concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-018","title":"Powell v.

Logan, Jr., of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Rhonda Hendrix brought this negligence action against Duke Energy Corporation and others after her daughter suffered an electrical shock when she touched a dock Hendrix owned at Lake Keowee.Â  Hendrix alleged Duke was negligent in failing to properly oversee the permitting of the dock.Â  The circuit court granted Dukeâ€™s motion for summary judgment, finding as a matter of law that Duke owed no duty of care in this regard and that, in any event, the claim was barred by the South Carolina Recreational Use Statute.Â  Hendrix appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nDuke owns Lake Keowee in Oconee County and operates it pursuant to a license granted by the Federal Energy Regulation Commission (FERC) covering the â€œKeowee-Toxaway Project.â€Â  In 1996, FERC issued an â€œOrder Amending Licenseâ€ to Duke stating the purpose of the amendment was â€œto reduce some administrative burden on [Duke]â€ by allowing it to authorize certain minor uses of the property without seeking prior approval from FERC.Â  Among other things, Duke was authorized to grant permission for the use of boat docks that were intended to serve single-family dwellings.Â Â Â  \r\nThe order â€œcontain[ed] conditions designed to ensure that any authorized use . . . permitted . . . is consistent with the project license and the protection of the projectâ€™s scenic, recreational, and other environmental values.â€Â  Duke was required to â€œensure, to the satisfaction of the Commissionâ€™s [FERCâ€™s] authorized representative, that the uses and occupancies for which it grants permission are maintained in good repair and comply with applicable State and local health and safety requirements.â€Â  The order further provided as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n  [Duke] shall . . . have continuing responsibility to supervise and control the use and occupancies for which it grants permission, and to monitor the use of, ensure compliance with the covenants of the instrument of conveyance for, any interests that it has conveyed under this article.Â  If a permitted use and occupancy violates any condition of this article or any other condition imposed by [Duke] for protection and enhancement of the projectâ€™s scenic, recreational, or other environmental values, or, if a covenant of a conveyance made under the authority of this article is violated, [Duke] shall take any lawful action necessary to correct the violation.Â  \r\n\r\nManagement of Lake Keowee is also controlled by Dukeâ€™s own Shoreline Management Guidelines.Â  The purpose of the Guidelines â€œis to provide detailed procedures and criteria to regulate activities within reservoirs managed by Duke . . . .â€Â  The Guidelines state â€œLake Management is responsible for the continuous monitoring of activities within the boundaries of Duke reservoirs to ensure activities are consistent with established company policies and license requirements.â€Â  \r\nAs part of its management of Lake Keowee, Duke conducted inspections of docks built on the lake and issued permits for construction.Â  Dukeâ€™s formal permitting process began in 1987 and applied only to future construction; docks built prior to 1987 were grandfathered in â€œunless the dock was in such bad repair that it was a navigational hazard.â€Â  Duke did not check electrical power to docks and has no guidelines or rules regulating electrical power to docks.Â  Dukeâ€™s inspections were limited to checking â€œto make sure the dock was safe and not a navigational hazardâ€ and making sure the permitee â€œbuilt what they were approved for.â€Â  \r\nIn 1999, Rhonda Hendrix was the owner of real property abutting Lake Keowee.Â  Hendrixâ€™s property included a dock that extended into Lake Keowee.Â  A light fixture on the dock connected to electric transmission wires that ran to Hendrixâ€™s house.Â  Sometime prior to 1999, Duke issued a permit for Hendrixâ€™s dock.Â  The trial court noted â€œ[t]he Hendrix dock appears to be one of those docks that was already in existence in 1987 and that was issued a tag or permit without an application or inspection.â€Â  \r\nIn 1998, Hendrix purchased a swimming pool from Recreational Factory Warehouse, which subcontracted the installation to Tri-States Installation, Inc.Â  Tri-States, in turn, hired a grading contractor to grade the yard prior to installation.Â  The grading contractor apparently cut some of the electrical wires in the yard.Â  Someone then spliced the wires back together and left them in the yard.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn the spring of 1999, Hendrix hired Mike Burton, an electrician, to install an outlet near the pool.Â  Hendrix informed Burton that her daughter Haley had been shocked at the boat dock about two weeks earlier.Â  When Burton installed the outlet, he inspected the dock wiring and determined all of the dock wiring â€œneeded to be redoneâ€ as â€œnone of that stuff was to code.â€Â  Specifically, he noticed â€œthat the wires were just exposed and nothing was in conduit.â€Â  According to Burton, state code requires installing all electric wires on docks in a flex conduit.Â  Burton showed Hendrix the wires and advised her that he did not have time to fix them and that she would need to secure the services of another electrician to correct the problem.Â  \r\nOn August 14, 1999, Hendrixâ€™s daughter Haley and some friends left the Hendrix dock for a boat outing.Â  When the boat stalled, Haley jumped out of the boat and swam back to the Hendrix dock.Â  When she touched the dock, she received an electric shock and was rendered unconscious.Â  A neighbor, Alan D. Wheeler, heard screams for help and came over in his boat to help.Â  When he touched the Hendrix dock, Wheeler was electrocuted.Â Â  Haley survived the accident, but suffered severe personal injuries.Â  \r\nHendrix filed this action against Duke and others to recover for Haleyâ€™s injuries, alleging Haley was injured â€œdue to faulty installation of the pool and electrical wiring.â€Â  As to Duke, Hendrix alleged Duke was negligent and reckless in the management of Lake Keowee and in the inspection and permitting of the Hendrix dock.Â  \r\nDuke moved for summary judgment, arguing it had no duty of care.Â  Hendrix alleged a duty of care arose from Dukeâ€™s status as owner or manager of Lake Keowee, from the FERC license (as amended), or from Dukeâ€™s own Guidelines.Â  The trial court ruled as a matter of law that no duty existed and granted Dukeâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  Hendrix appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the grant of a motion for summary judgment, an appellate court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Ferguson v. Charleston Lincoln Mercury, Inc., 349 S.C. 558, 564 S.E.2d 94 (2002).Â  Summary judgment is appropriate when â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; see also Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Marine Contracting &amp; Towing Co., 301 S.C. 418, 421, 392 S.E.2d 460, 462 (1990).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.Â  Summer v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 492 S.E.2d 55 (1997).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Negligence Liability\r\nOn appeal, Hendrix argues Duke owed a duty to exercise reasonable care to inspect the electrical wiring at the Hendrix dock and to discover the allegedly faulty wiring.Â  \r\nâ€œTo establish a cause of action in negligence, a plaintiff must prove the following three elements: (1) a duty of care owed by [the] defendant to [the] plaintiff; (2) breach of that duty by a negligent act or omission; and (3) damage proximately resulting from the breach of duty.â€Â  Bloom v. Ravoira,&nbsp;339 S.C. 417, 422, 529 S.E.2d 710, 712&nbsp;(2000).Â  â€œThe absence of any one of these elements renders the cause of action insufficient.â€Â  South Carolina State Ports Auth. v. Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton, Inc.,&nbsp;289 S.C. 373, 376, 346 S.E.2d 324, 325&nbsp;(1986).\r\nâ€œThe court must determine, as a matter of law, whether the law recognizes a particular duty.â€Â  Simmons v. Tuomey Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 341 S.C. 32, 39, 533 S.E.2d 312, 316&nbsp;(2000). Â â€œIf there is no duty, then the defendant in a negligence action is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Id.\r\na.Â  Duty owed as Owner and Manager\r\nHendrix asserts Duke owed a duty to exercise reasonable care by virtue of its status as the owner and manager of Lake Keowee.Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œAn owner of land possesses a general duty to warn others of latent hazardous conditions on his land.â€Â  Byerly v. Connor, 307 S.C. 441, 443, 415 S.E.2d 796, 798 (1992).Â  â€œThis duty arises from the ownerâ€™s superior knowledge of conditions on the premises within his control.â€Â  Id. \r\nWe hold Duke had no duty to warn of faulty electrical wiring on Hendrixâ€™s dock because Duke did not have control of the dock and did not have superior knowledge of the conditions on the dock.Â  \r\nThe facts of this case are similar to those of Byerly.Â  In Byerly, a lake user was electrocuted after diving into Lake Marion from a houseboat that was moored to a dock operated by a lessee (J &amp; J Marina, Inc.) of Santee Cooper.Â  Either a defectively wired outlet on the dock or a defect in the wiring of the houseboat itself caused the shock.Â  Id. at 443, 415 S.E.2d at 798.Â  Our supreme court noted that in typical lease agreements the lessor generally â€œis not responsible for hazardous conditions which thereafter develop or are created by the lessee,â€ in part because â€œthe lessor surrenders possession and control of the land to the lessee.â€Â  Id.Â  The supreme court affirmed the trial judgeâ€™s grant of summary judgment to Santee Cooper, concluding the lake owner had no duty to discover and warn of a latent hazardous condition which it did not create and about which it had no knowledge.Â  Id. at 445-46, 415 S.E.2d at 799.Â  The court stated Santee Cooperâ€™s limited undertaking to inspect docks and piers to ensure that they conformed to the structural requirements of the permits issued by Santee Cooper â€œdid not include a duty to inspect for a latent hazardous electrical condition at J &amp; J Marina.â€Â  Id.Â  at 445, 415 S.E.2d at 799.\r\nWhile the appeal now before us does not involve a lease, the analysis is the same.Â  The key element imposing a general duty on landowners to warn of latent hazardous defects is the landownerâ€™s presumed superior knowledge based on control and possession of property.Â  A landowner lacking control and possession does not have the same general duty.Â  Duke, like the lake owner in Byerly, did not have control of the dock and therefore possessed no superior knowledge of the property.Â  Accordingly, we hold Duke owed no duty to discover and warn lake users of faulty wiring on Hendrixâ€™s dock.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nCategorizing Haley as an invitee does not change the analysis.Â  Hendrix argues Duke owed Haley a duty to exercise reasonable care because of Haleyâ€™s status as an â€œinvitee.â€Â  A landowner has a duty to warn an invitee of latent or hidden dangers of which the landowner has knowledge or should have knowledge.Â  See, e.g., Callander v. Charleston Doughnut Corp., 305 S.C. 123, 126, 406 S.E.2d 361, 362 (1991).Â  The invitorâ€™s liability rests entirely upon his superior knowledge of the danger that caused the inviteeâ€™s injuries.Â  Larimore v. Carolina Power &amp; Light, 340 S.C. 438, 448, 531 S.E.2d 535, 540 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The invitor cannot be held liable, however, if the invitor lacks superior knowledge.Â  Id.Â  Thus, even if Haley is determined to be an invitee, Duke owed Haley no duty to warn of the faulty wiring on Hendrixâ€™s dock because Duke lacked superior knowledge of the property.\r\nb.Â  Duty arising from FERC License\r\nHendrix next contends Duke owed a duty to exercise reasonable care based on the provisions of the FERC license (as amended).Â  \r\nâ€œAn affirmative legal duty to act exists only if created by statute, contract, relationship, status, property interest, or some other special circumstance.â€Â  Charleston Dry Cleaners &amp; Laundry, Inc. v. Zurich American Ins. Co., 355 S.C. 614, 618, 586 S.E.2d 586, 588 (2003).Â Â  \r\nWe agree with the trial courtâ€™s conclusion that the general requirements imposed by the FERC license cannot be read to create in Duke a duty to discover and warn of a latent hazardous defect which it did not create and about which it had no knowledge.Â  The FERC license requires Duke to â€œensure . . . that the uses and occupancies for which it grants permission are maintained in good repair and comply with applicable State and local health and safety requirements,â€ and imposes on Duke a â€œcontinuing responsibility to supervise and control the use and occupancies for which it grants permission.â€Â  As noted by the trial court, there is no indication the license creates a private right of action, even if Duke failed to meet the licenseâ€™s conditions.Â Â Â  \r\nReading the licenseâ€™s general requirements to create a special duty to inspect dock wiring would make Duke an absolute insurer of the safety of every person who uses or comes in contact with a dock on Lake Keowee, even though Duke does not own, construct, or control such docks.Â  This was clearly not the intent of the license, and to adopt such a finding would be an unreasonable interpretation of the license.Â  We conclude the FERC license did not create a duty to Hendrix even if it did result in an obligation to FERC.Â  Accordingly, we find Duke does not owe dock users a duty of care by virtue of the general requirements contained in the FERC license.[1]Â Â Â  Â \r\nc.Â  Duty Arising from Undertaking and by Virtue of Guidelines\r\nHendrix alleges Dukeâ€™s own Guidelines and its undertaking to inspect docks on Lake Keowee created in Duke a duty to exercise reasonable care to discover the allegedly faulty wiring on her dock. \r\nâ€œAt common law, where there is no duty to act, but an act is voluntarily undertaken, the actor assumes a duty to use due care.â€Â  Byerly, 307 S.C. at 445, 415 S.E.2d at 799.Â  Nonetheless, â€œ[t]he concept of a duty in tort liability will not extend beyond reasonable limits.â€Â  Huggins v. Citibank, 355 S.C. 329, 333, 585 S.E.2d 275, 277 (2003). \r\nWe agree with the trial court that Duke did not undertake to inspect the electrical wiring of the docks on Lake Keowee and, therefore, no act by Duke created any duty to use reasonable care to inspect the docks.Â  Dukeâ€™s permitting process only sought to make sure permitted docks were structurally sound and did not create a navigational hazard.Â  Duke did not check electrical power to docks and had no policies or rules regulating electrical power on private docks.Â  Under similar facts in Byerly, our supreme court found that the lake owner only undertook a â€œlimited duty to use due care to discover structural nonconformity with permits,â€ and that â€œundertaking to inspect for structural conformity did not include a duty to inspect for a latent hazardous electrical condition.â€Â  Id., 307 S.C. at 445, 415 S.E.2d at 799.Â  The evidence shows Duke did not undertake a duty to inspect electrical wiring on the docks, and its permitting process cannot be used to create such a duty.Â  \r\nII.Â  The South Carolina Recreational Use Statute\r\nHendrix next argues the trial court erred in ruling the South Carolina Recreational Use Statute applied so as to limit Dukeâ€™s liability.Â  The court stated the statute provided an additional ground for summary judgment beyond the fact that there was no common law duty.Â  Hendrix argues Duke was grossly negligent, an exception to the statute. \r\nâ€œThe purpose of [the Recreational Use Statute] is to encourage owners of land to make land and water areas available to the public for recreational purposes by limiting their liability toward persons entering thereon for such purposes.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-3-10 (1991).Â  A â€œâ€˜[r]ecreational purposeâ€™ includes, but is not limited to, any of the following, or any combination thereof:Â Â  . . . swimming, boating, . . . [and] summer and winter sports . . . .â€Â  Id. Â§ 27-3-20(c).Â  \r\nThe Recreational Use Statute states â€œan owner of land owes no duty of care to keep the premises safe for entry or use by persons who have sought and obtained his permission to use it for recreational purposes or to give any warning of a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity on such premises to such persons entering for such purposes.â€Â  Id. Â§ 27-3-30.Â  There are, however, two exceptions as the statute does not limit liability which otherwise exists for (1) â€œgrossly negligent, willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activityâ€ orÂ  (2) â€œinjury suffered . . . where the owner of land charges personsâ€ who use the property.Â  Id. Â§ 27-3-60.Â Â Â  \r\nThe Recreational Use Statute specifically limits the liability of landowners who make property available to the public for recreational purposes.Â  Duke falls squarely within the parameters of the Recreational Use Statute because Duke allowed members of the public to use Lake Keowee for recreational purposes (e.g., swimming and boating).Â  Duke, therefore,Â  generally owed no duty to lake users â€œto keep the premises safeâ€ or â€œto give any warning of a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity.â€Â  See S.C. Code Â§ 27-3-30(a) &amp; (b). \r\nOn appeal, Hendrix asserts Duke falls within the grossly negligent exception to the Recreational Use Statute.Â  We find there is no evidence to support an allegation that Duke was grossly negligent.Â  â€œGross negligence is the intentional, conscious failure to do something which it is incumbent upon one to do or the doing of a thing intentionally that one ought not to do.â€Â  Richardson v. Hambright, 296 S.C. 504, 506, 374 S.E.2d 296, 298 (1988).Â  Duke had no duty to inspect dock wiring and committed no intentional act.Â  Thus, as a matter of law, Duke cannot be found grossly negligent and the trial court correctly found the Recreational Use Statute limits Dukeâ€™s liability and provides an additional ground supporting summary judgment.[2]Â Â  \r\nIII.Â  Punitive Damages \r\nHendrix lastly argues the trial court improperly granted summary judgment on her punitive damages claim because a jury could find a conscious failure to exercise due care by Duke.Â  \r\nâ€œIn order for a plaintiff to recover punitive damages, there must be evidence the defendantâ€™s conduct was wilful, wanton, or in reckless disregard of the plaintiffâ€™s rights.â€Â  McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. 301, 308, 457 S.E.2d 603, 607 (1995).Â  â€œA conscious failure to exercise due care constitutes wilfulness.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nNo evidence in the record indicates Duke acted in a wilful, wanton, or reckless manner.Â  As discussed above, Duke owed no duty of care to discover or warn of faulty wiring on Hendrixâ€™s dock.Â  Accordingly, Duke did not demonstrate â€œa conscious failure to exercise due care,â€ and we find the trial court properly dismissed Hendrixâ€™s claim for punitive damages.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find, as a matter of law, Duke owed no duty of care to lake users to discover or warn of a latent hazardous defect which it did not create and about which it had no knowledge.Â  The decision of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The trial court also found that Hendrix could not rely on the provisions in the FERC license to create a duty in this state court action because 16 U.S.C.A. Â§ 825p (2005) provides violations come within the jurisdiction of the federal courts.Â  This section provides as follows:\r\n\r\n  The District Courts of the United States . . . shall have exclusive jurisdiction of violations of [the Federal Power Act] or the rules, regulations, and orders thereunder, and of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by . . . this chapter or rule, regulation, or order thereunder. \r\n\r\nHendrix disputes the trial courtâ€™s finding.Â  She acknowledges that, where FERC seeks to enforce an obligation against a licensee for violating a provision of its FERC license, it must do so in federal court, but argues this â€œdoes not mean that a plaintiff suing on a state law negligence claim must sue in federal court when he uses the FERC license to establish a duty of care.â€Â  Since we have found the FERC license would not, in any event, create a duty in this regard, we need not decide whether it is applicable in state court.Â  \r\n[2]Â Â  Hendrix does not argue on appeal that the second exception regarding the charge of a fee applies in this case.Â  The trial court ruled that this exception did not apply as Hendrix had made â€œno allegation and no proof that Duke charged a fee for the Plaintiffsâ€™ recreational use of Lake Keowee or for the Hendrix dock.â€Â  Since no challenge is made to this finding, it is the law of the case.Â  Accordingly, we do not address this exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-023","title":"State v.

McDougall and Emma I. Bryson, both of Sumter, for Appellant.\r\n        James L. Hills, of Myrtle Beach, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Stanley Philips Hunnicutt (Husband) appeals from the family courtâ€™s order granting Jane Addis Hunnicutt (Wife) a divorce and awarding her alimony, an equitable division of the marital property, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  He asserts the family court improperly awarded alimony based, in part, on expenses associated with the partiesâ€™ emancipated daughter.Â  Additionally, he contends the family court erred in its valuation of marital property, including Wifeâ€™s retirement account.Â  Finally, he maintains the court erred in awarding Wife attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and modify in part.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were married for nearly twenty-six years and lived in Greenville County.Â  The parties had two daughters, both of whom were emancipated.Â  One of the daughters attended college and was aided financially by Wife.Â  Additionally, the parties had historically allocated money received from a partnership towards her tuition.Â  \r\nShortly before the parties separated, Husband was terminated from his employment with Springs Industries and received a severance package equal to six months salary.Â  Husband became self-employed as a sales representative for ViPac.Â  His salary was approximately $73,000 per year.Â  Wife testified Husband informed her that once he was established he could earn greater income in the range of $90-110,000 per year. \r\nAfter the separation, Wife moved to the partiesâ€™ residence in Horry County and took a teaching position.Â  However, in early 2003, Wife returned to Greenville due to emotional problems.Â  She eventually took a position as a guidance counselor earning a gross income of approximately $53,000 per year. \r\nWife sought a divorce on the ground of Husbandâ€™s adultery.Â  She further sought permanent periodic or lump sum alimony, an equitable division of the partiesâ€™ assets and debts, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Husband answered and counterclaimed requesting that neither party receive alimony, the marital residence be sold, an equitable division of marital assets, and attorneyâ€™s fees. \r\nThe family court granted the divorce on the ground of Husbandâ€™s adultery, awarded Wife permanent periodic alimony of $750 per month, awarded Wife the marital home, divided the marital assets equally (fifty percent to each party), and awarded Wife $10,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  After Husband filed a motion for reconsideration, the family court altered the amount of his severance package for the purpose of dividing the marital estate.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992); Owens v. Owens, 320 S.C. 543, 546, 466 S.E.2d 373, 375 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  Nor must we ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981); Miles v. Miles, 355 S.C. 511, 516, 586 S.E.2d 136, 139 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nHusband contends the family court erred in its determination that Wife was entitled to an award of alimony, the valuation of Wifeâ€™s retirement account, the equitable distribution of marital property, and the award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife. \r\nI.Â Â Alimony\r\nHusband maintains the family court erred in awarding Wife permanent periodic alimony.Â  First, he contends Wifeâ€™s testimony indicated she sought rehabilitative alimony, which was not requested in her complaint.Â  Second, he asserts Wifeâ€™s financial declarations improperly included expenses related to the partiesâ€™ daughter and the need for alimony was not shown.Â  Finally, he argues the family court erred in imputing income to him as a result of his termination from Springs and his self-employment as a sales representative. \r\nAn award of alimony rests within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 282, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002).Â  â€œAlimony is a substitute for the support which is normally incident to the marital relationship.â€Â  Spence v. Spence, 260 S.C. 526, 529, 197 S.E.2d 683, 684 (1973); Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  â€œGenerally, alimony should place the supported spouse, as nearly as is practical, in the same position he or she enjoyed during the marriage.â€Â  Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 184, 554 S.E.2d 421, 424 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œIt is the duty of the family court to make an alimony award that is fit, equitable, and just if the claim is well founded.â€Â  Id. at 184, 554 S.E.2d at 424.Â  The family court judge may grant alimony in an amount and for a term as the judge considers appropriate under the circumstances. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(A) (Supp. 2004).\r\nFactors to be considered in making an alimony award include:Â  (1) duration of the marriage; (2) physical and emotional health of the parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4) employment history and earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living established during the marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the parties; (7) current and reasonably anticipated expenses of the parties; (8) marital and nonmarital properties of the parties; (9) custody of children; (10) marital misconduct or fault; (11) tax consequences; and (12) prior support obligations; as well as (13) other factors the court considers relevant.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2004).Â  The court is required to consider all relevant factors in determining alimony.Â  Epperly v. Epperly, 312 S.C. 411, 415, 440 S.E.2d 884, 886 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  No one factor is dispositive.Â  Lide v. Lide, 277 S.C. 155, 157, 283 S.E.2d 832, 833 (1981).\r\nA.Â Â Wifeâ€™s Testimony\r\nHusband contends Wifeâ€™s testimony established that she sought rehabilitative alimony of only $750 per month for ten years.Â  He claims because this type of alimony was not requested in her complaint, she should be barred from receiving any alimony.Â  In the alternative, he contends the family court erred in awarding her $750 per month as permanent periodic alimony given her testimony.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œAlthough rehabilitative alimony may be an appropriate form of spousal support in some cases, permanent periodic alimony is favored in South Carolina.â€Â  Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 95, 545 S.E.2d 531, 535 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œRehabilitative alimony may be awarded only upon a showing of special circumstances justifying a departure from the normal preference for permanent periodic support.Â  The purpose of rehabilitative alimony is to encourage a dependent spouse to become self-supporting after a divorce.â€Â  Id. \r\nAdditionally, â€œ[t]he appellate courts of this state have said many times that ordinarily a party may not receive relief not contemplated in his pleadings.â€Â  Loftis v. Loftis, 286 S.C. 12, 13-14, 331 S.E.2d 372, 373 (Ct. App. 1985) (citing Gainey v. Gainey, 279 S.C. 68, 301 S.E.2d 763 (1983);Â  Ingram v. Ingram, 273 S.C. 113, 254 S.E.2d 680 (1979); Bass v. Bass, 272 S.C. 177, 249 S.E.2d 905 (1978); Bolding v. Bolding, 283 S.C. 501, 323 S.E.2d 535 (Ct. App. 1984); Bryan v. Bryan, 282 S.C. 506, 319 S.E.2d 360 (Ct. App. 1984)).Â  â€œDue process requires that a litigant be placed on notice of the issues which the court is to consider.â€Â  Richardson v. Richardson, 309 S.C. 31, 35, 419 S.E.2d 806, 808 (Ct. App. 1992).\r\nWifeâ€™s pleadings made a request for the court to â€œrequire the Defendant both pendente lite and permanently, to pay a reasonable amount of permanent periodic support to Plaintiff . . . or, in the alternative, for payment of a lump sum based upon the Defendantâ€™s substantial estate.â€Â  Later in her complaint she again requested either permanent periodic or lump sum alimony, but never did she specifically request rehabilitative alimony.Â  Her complaint also asked the court to grant â€œsuch other and further relief as [the family court] may deem just and appropriate.â€ \r\nDuring her trial testimony, Wife was asked:Â  â€œMrs. Hunnicutt, do you think that the Court should award you alimony?â€Â  She replied:Â  â€œYes, sir.â€Â  She was then asked:Â  â€œAnd do you have an amount that you think would be fair and appropriate?â€Â  She responded:Â  â€œ$750 a month for ten years.â€Â  In explaining her answer she stated:Â  â€œLooking at my salary and what I can make and what [Husbandâ€™s] salary is and what he can make, I felt like that would be a fair price.â€ \r\nHusband made a motion for an involuntary dismissal of Wifeâ€™s cause of action for alimony, arguing her testimony did not support a type of alimony requested in her complaint. Â The court denied the motion, and ultimately awarded Wife $750 a month in permanent periodic alimony.Â  The court noted:Â  â€œThis court found [Wife] to be in the $1000.00 per month category, but awarded $750.00 because that is what [Wife] asked for. . . . Court finds it does not have the authority to cap this amount or to impose a time limit, therefore, this award is a permanent periodic alimony.Â  There were no facts for rehabilitative alimony.â€Â  \r\nWhile Wifeâ€™s request in her testimony appears to ask for rehabilitative alimony, it was merely a suggestion of an amount she felt was fair.Â  She clearly believed Husband had more income and should have to contribute to her standard of living.Â  Her explanation indicates she felt the alimony should continue as long as there was a difference in the incomes of the parties.Â  Additionally, there was no case presented to support a claim of rehabilitative alimony.Â  Finally, Husband was well aware of Wifeâ€™s request for permanent periodic alimony as it was properly requested in her complaint.\r\nThe family court judge may grant alimony in an amount and for a term as the judge considers appropriate under the circumstances. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(A) (Supp. 2004).Â  Under the circumstances of this case, it was not error for the judge to award permanent periodic alimony when it was requested in Wifeâ€™s complaint, Wifeâ€™s testimony was suggestive of rehabilitative or periodic alimony, and there was clearly no case made for rehabilitative alimony. Â Accordingly, we find the court did not abuse its discretion in awarding permanent periodic alimony to Wife or in denying Husbandâ€™s motion for an involuntary nonsuit on the issue of alimony.\r\nB.Â Â Â Daughterâ€™s Expenses\r\nHusband maintains Wifeâ€™s financial declarations include numerous expenses attributable to the partiesâ€™ daughter who is attending college.Â  He asserts the financial declaration was inherently unreliable and any remaining expenses do not justify an award of alimony.Â  We disagree.\r\nFirst, most of Husbandâ€™s claims are not preserved for review on appeal.Â  In his motion for reconsideration after the court specifically excluded some items on Wifeâ€™s financial declaration and set the amount of alimony, Husband did not request the court recalculate the amount based on additional items belonging to the daughter and not Wife.Â  He never raised the issue of additional school expenses being included in the calculation of the amount of alimony.Â  Accordingly, the issue is not preserved for review on appeal.Â  See Widman v. Widman, 348 S.C. 97, 119, 557 S.E.2d 693, 704 (Ct. App. 2001) (holding issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review).Â Â  \r\nHusbandâ€™s claim would also fail on the merits.Â  The family court specifically stated:Â  â€œThis Court is not awarding any college expenses of the daughter to [Wife], to be paid by [Husband]. . . . In [Wifeâ€™s] Financial Declaration, the rent expense of $348.00 per month and the school expense of $950.00 per month are school expenses of Blair, and have not been considered.â€Â  The court went on to examine all of the relevant factors under section 20-3-130(C).\r\nThe court properly considered the relevant factors and made very detailed findings of fact regarding the required factors.Â  The court found Wifeâ€™s expenses were about $1000 more than her income and that Husband had the ability to pay in order to maintain Wifeâ€™s standard of living.Â  We find no abuse of discretion in the courtâ€™s determination that Wife was entitled to $750 per month in alimony, even if some of the expenses questioned by Husband are removed.\r\nC.Â Â Imputation of Income\r\nHusband asserts the trial court erred in imputing income in the range of $90-120,000 per year to him when his financial declaration indicated he was earning approximately $73,000 and there was no evidence to show he could have been making additional income.Â  Although we agree with this assertion, we find it would not change the award of alimony.\r\nIt is well settled in South Carolina that an award of alimony should be based on the payor spouseâ€™s earning potential rather than merely his current, reported earnings.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C)(4) &amp; -130(C)(6) (Supp. 2004) (requiring the family court to consider â€œthe employment history and earning potential of each spouseâ€ and â€œthe current and reasonably anticipated earnings of both spousesâ€ when awarding alimony).Â  Accordingly, a spouse obligated to pay alimony may not voluntarily or intentionally change his employment or economic circumstances so as to curtail his income and thereby avoid paying alimony or child support.Â  See Camp v. Camp, 269 S.C. 173, 174, 236 S.E.2d 814, 815 (1977) (affirming family courtâ€™s decision ordering Husband/Father to continue paying alimony and child support at the same amount he agreed to pay prior to his voluntary change in employment which resulted in a reduced income).Â  \r\nGiven the principle of imputation of income for the purpose of spousal support is analogous to that of child support, we are instructed by case law involving child support.Â  Where a parent voluntarily lessens his or her earning capacity, this court will closely scrutinize the facts to determine the parentâ€™s earning potential, rather than the parentâ€™s actual income.Â  Camp, 269 S.C. at 174, 236 S.E.2d at 815; Robinson v. Tyson, 319 S.C. 360, 363, 461 S.E.2d 397, 399 (Ct. App. 1995); see Chastain v. Chastain, 289 S.C. 281, 283, 346 S.E.2d 33, 35 (Ct. App. 1986) (finding that father with masterâ€™s degree voluntarily removed himself from the job market to attend law school and his earning potential was properly considered in calculating child support).Â  The failure by a parent to reach full earning capacity, by itself, does not automatically equate to voluntary underemployment such that income must be imputed.Â  See Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, 488-89, 477 S.E.2d 727, 731 (Ct. App. 1996) (â€œ[I]ncreased or decreased income, without more, is insufficient to warrant a change in circumstances; the failure to reach earning capacity, by itself, does not automatically equate to voluntary underemployment such that income must be imputed.â€)(citations omitted).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe family court found Husband was terminated from his employment with Springs where he earned â€œover $9,000.00 per month.â€ Â Additionally, the court found he was self-employed, earning $73,424.90 in his first year in sales.Â  While the amount he was earning as a sales representative for ViPac was less than the amount he earned at Springs, there was no evidence presented indicating he could have found a similar position to the one at Springs or intentionally forfeited income in order to avoid paying alimony.Â  Additionally, the only indication that his earning potential was in the range of $90-120,000 was from Wife, who testified Husband told her he could build up the job to make $90-110,000.Â  This is insufficient evidence to support a finding Husband was underemployed and should have additional income imputed to him in order to calculate alimony.\r\nNotwithstanding our finding that the court improperly imputed additional income, the amount of the alimony awarded is not excessive and need not be altered.Â  As discussed above, the court properly considered all relevant factors including the length of the marriage, Husbandâ€™s fault in the divorce, the income differential, and the partiesâ€™ standard of living.Â  Even considering the new income differential, it clearly does not outweigh the other factors, which suggested the award was proper. Â Accordingly, we reverse the courtâ€™s order so far as it imputed income to Husband, but affirm the award of alimony because the imputation did not result in an excess award.\r\nII.Â Â Wifeâ€™s Retirement Account\r\nHusband contends the family court erred in its valuation of Wifeâ€™s retirement account.Â  He asserts the court improperly valued her State Retirement Plan as a defined contribution plan instead of as a defined benefits plan.Â  However, these arguments were not presented to the family court in Husbandâ€™s motion to reconsider, alter or amend.Â  Accordingly, the issues are not preserved for our review on appeal.Â  Widman v. Widman, 348 S.C. 97, 119, 557 S.E.2d 693, 704 (Ct. App. 2001) (holding issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review); see also Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€). \r\nIII.Â Â Equitable Distribution\r\nHusband contends the family court erred in its equitable distribution by improperly including his severance pay and the down payment on his condominium in the marital estate.Â  He also contends the court erred by not including money used by Wife which was received from a partnership that included Wife and Husband.Â  He maintains the court erred in not including in the marital estate proceeds from the sale of the family home that Husband alleges Wife dissipated prior to the final order.Â  Finally, he asserts the court erred in its division of the coupleâ€™s credit card debt.Â  \r\n The apportionment of marital property is within the discretion of the family court judge and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Morris v. Morris, 295 S.C. 37, 39, 367 S.E.2d 24, 25 (1988).Â  Section 20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code provides the family court must consider fifteen factors and give each weight as it determines.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2004).Â  On review, this court looks to the fairness of the overall apportionment, and if the end result is equitable, the fact that this court might have weighed specific factors differently than the family court is irrelevant.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300-01, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988); see Doe v. Doe, 324 S.C. 492, 502, 478 S.E.2d 854, 859 (Ct. App. 1996) (stating the reviewing court will affirm the family court judgeâ€™s apportionment of marital property if it can be determined that the judge addressed the relevant factors under section 20-7-472 with sufficiency for the reviewing court to conclude the judge was cognizant of the statutory factors).\r\nA.Â Â Severance Pay\r\nHusband contends the family court erred by including his six months severance pay as part of the marital estate.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 20-7-473 of the South Carolina Code defines marital property as â€œall real and personal property which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation as provided in Â§ 20-7-472 regardless of how legal title is held.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2004).Â  This court recently addressed severance pay in Bowman v. Bowman, 357 S.C. 146, 158, 591 S.E.2d 654, 660 (Ct. App. 2004):\r\n\r\n  [W]e adhere to South Carolinaâ€™s sound and established approach of scrutinizing the true nature and purpose of the benefit.Â  See, e.g., Mears v. Mears, 305 S.C. 150, 156, 406 S.E.2d 376, 380 (Ct. App. 1991), overruled on other grounds by Marsh v. Marsh, 313 S.C. 42, 437 S.E.2d 34 (1993) (concluding proper classification of employment termination benefits as marital or nonmarital property â€œdepends on the purpose of the paymentsâ€); Mallett v. Mallett, 323 S.C. 141, 152, 473 S.E.2d 804, 810 (Ct. App. 1996) (holding property classified as nonmarital because the â€œpurposeâ€ of the benefit was to replace earnings after the date commencement of marital litigation); Fisher v. Fisher, 319 S.C. 500, 504, 462 S.E.2d 303, 305 (Ct. App. 1995) (finding benefits paid pursuant to a â€œvoluntary separation incentiveâ€ were analogous to an â€œearly retirement,â€ and the payments were thus deemed marital property â€œunder the facts of this caseâ€); Tinsley v. Tinsley, 326 S.C. 374, 381-82, 483 S.E.2d 198, 202 (Ct. App. 1997) (holding disability benefits were not marital property since the â€œpayments are a replacement for income he would be earning currently and would be able to earn in the future had he not become disabledâ€).Â  Thus, classification of property as marital or nonmarital must be determined in light of the true nature and purpose of the benefit.Â  South Carolina does not classify property as marital or nonmarital based on the title or nomenclature assigned by a party.\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, the contract between Husband and Springs involving the six months severance pay clearly indicated it was given to Husband in exchange for his agreement â€œto release Springs from any and all claims, suits, demands, or other causes of action of any kind . . . [Husband] might have against Springs . . . .â€Â  Accordingly, the family court did not err in including the pay received prior to filing of marital litigation in the marital estate to be divided amongst the parties.\r\nB.Â Â KKB Partnership\r\nHusband maintains two payments received from the KKB Partnership were used solely by Wife and should have been included in the marital estate of the parties due to Husband not receiving the benefit of the payment.Â  We agree in part.\r\nInitially, we note Husband only contested the family courtâ€™s failure to include one payment of $3,000 in the marital estate and not the two payments he addresses on appeal.Â  Accordingly, we need only address the issue of the payment that was raised to the family court for its consideration as the issue regarding the other payment is not preserved for our review on appeal.Â  See Widman v. Widman, 348 S.C. 97, 119, 557 S.E.2d 693, 704 (Ct. App. 2001) (holding issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review).\r\nâ€œWe continue to recognize and respect the broad discretion accorded to family court judges in the fact-sensitive inquiries surrounding the identification of marital and nonmarital property as well as the determination of the equitable distribution of the marital estate.â€Â  Bowman v. Bowman, 357 S.C. 146, 156, 591 S.E.2d 654, 659 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nThe family court specifically found Wife received the $3,000 payment from the real estate partnership, which included both parties as well as other family members.Â  The court further found Wife spent the money on tuition for the daughter in college.Â  Uncontroverted testimony presented at trial indicated the amount received from the partnership was given every year to the daughter for use in paying her college expenses.\r\nBecause the contested payment was received prior to the filing of this litigation, we hold the trial court erred in declining to find it constituted marital property.Â  However, we find no reversible error given the payment had already been disposed of and, thus, was not available for equitable distribution.Â  Moreover, we note Husband never objected to Wifeâ€™s use of the KKB partnership payment to pay for the daughterâ€™s tuition nor did Husband express a desired intent to seek reimbursement for these payments.\r\nC.Â Simpsonville Home\r\nHusband contends Wife dissipated the proceeds received from the sale of their Simpsonville home shortly before the filing for divorce.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, we question whether this issue is preserved for review on appeal given it was not specifically raised to the trial court in Husbandâ€™s motion for reconsideration and was never addressed by the family court.Â  See Widman v. Widman, 348 S.C. 97, 119, 557 S.E.2d 693, 704 (Ct. App. 2001) (holding issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review).Â  However, to the extent it was briefly discussed during the hearing on Husbandâ€™s motion to reconsider, we have decided to address the merits. \r\nSubject to certain exceptions, â€œmarital propertyâ€ includes â€œall real and personal property which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2004).Â  Thus, for purposes of equitable distribution, the value of marital property is the value of the property at the time of the commencement of the marital litigation.Â  See Mallett v. Mallett, 323 S.C. 141, 151, 473 S.E.2d 804, 810 (Ct. App. 1996) (â€œMarital property is valued as of the date of the filing of the complaint.â€).Â  Our supreme court has noted:Â  â€œthere must be some evidence of willful misconduct, bad faith, intention to dissipate marital assets, or the like, before a court may alter the equitable distribution award for such misconduct.â€Â  McDavid v. McDavid, 333 S.C. 490, 496, 511 S.E.2d 365, 368 (1999).Â  \r\nWife was given $30,000 of the $70,000 in proceeds from the sale of the Simpsonville home.Â  Half was used to repay part of a debt owed to her father, with the remainder being spent by Wife for investigators, attorneys, tuition for the partiesâ€™ daughter, and a storage building.Â  Husband stated he believed she would use the entire $30,000 to pay off the debt to her father and because she did not do so, the $15,000 spent on other items should count against her portion of the estate.Â  Her expenses were not made with the intent of dissipating the martial assets so as to require a change in the equitable distribution.Â  Additionally, we note Husband does not appear any better able to document his expense of the $40,000 than Wife can explain the full expenses paid out of her $30,000 share.Â  Although Wife testified Husband paid off a second line of credit with the $40,000, there is no documentation as to what expenses constituted the significant increase in this debt.Â  Accordingly, the family court did not err in failing to count at least $15,000 against Wifeâ€™s equitable distribution.\r\nD.Â Â Condominium Down Payment\r\nHusband contends $7,000.00 used as a down payment on his condominium was part of his severance pay and, therefore, should not have been included in the marital estate.Â  We disagree.\r\nSubject to certain exceptions, â€œmarital propertyâ€ includes â€œall real and personal property which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2004).Â  As discussed above, the severance agreement provided for the payment of funds to Husband, which are marital assets due to their nature as compensation for a release of claims and not as payment of future earnings.Â  The agreement also included a provision allowing for the payment of up to $7,000 for relocation expenses.Â  While it appears Husband did not actually receive the check until after marital litigation was commenced, it is clear the benefit was received at the time the agreement was signed.Â  Thus, the value of the down payment later paid by Husband should be considered a marital asset as the right to repayment was in existence prior to filing of marital litigation.\r\nE.Â Â Credit Card Debt\r\nHusband contends the family court erred in requiring him to pay the full amount of the Visa credit card debt because it was in his name, even though both parties used the card prior to the filing of marital litigation.Â  We agree.\r\nPursuant to section 20-7-472(13) of the South Carolina Code, the family court is required to give consideration to the marital debts of the parties when making its equitable distribution of marital property.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472(13) (Supp. 2004).Â  â€œDebts incurred for marital purposes are subject to equitable distribution.â€Â  Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 103, 545 S.E.2d 531, 539 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Section 20-7-472 creates a rebuttable presumption that a debt of either spouse incurred prior to marital litigation is a marital debt, and must be factored into the totality of equitable apportionment.Â  Hickum v. Hickum, 320 S.C. 97, 102, 463 S.E.2d 321, 324 (Ct. App. 1995).\r\nMarital debt, like marital property, must be specifically identified and apportioned in equitable distribution.Â  Smith v. Smith, 327 S.C. 448, 457, 486 S.E.2d 516, 520 (Ct. App. 1997) (holding section 20-7-472 implicitly requires that marital debt, like marital property, be specifically identified and apportioned in the equitable distribution).Â  The same rules of fairness and equity that apply to the equitable division of marital property also apply to the division of marital debts.Â  Hardy v. Hardy, 311 S.C. 433, 437, 429 S.E.2d 811, 813-14 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn the instant case, the family court recognized the parties had marital credit card debt.Â  However, due to the confusion created by the partiesâ€™ financial declarations the court simply ordered that each side be responsible for the debt on their own financial declaration.Â  It appears this places the full burden of the partiesâ€™ Visa credit card bill upon Husband.Â  We find this result is not equitable given the evidence in the record.\r\nHusbandâ€™s first financial declaration included a Visa credit card with a balance of $10,708.Â  In his second financial declaration, he lists the balance as $20,000 but admitted the increase was nonmarital.Â  Wifeâ€™s first and second financial declaration listed a Visa credit card with a balance of $12,508.28.Â  However, at trial, she indicated the only Visa credit card she was aware of had a balance of about $2,000. \r\nBased on the evidence in the record, we find the Visa card listed on each partyâ€™s financial declaration is a marital debt.Â  Accordingly, we find the balance remaining at the time of the filing of marital litigation should be divided equally between the parties.Â  Therefore, we modify the family courtâ€™s order to require that each party be responsible for one-half of the $10,708 balance listed on Husbandâ€™s financial declaration.Â  Any increase in the balance above that amount will be the responsibility of Husband.\r\nIV.Â Â Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nHusband contends the family court erred in its award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees lies within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Bowen v. Bowen, 327 S.C. 561, 563, 490 S.E.2d 271, 272 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  The family court, in determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, should consider each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fees, the beneficial results obtained, the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions, and the effect of the fee on the partiesâ€™ standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  In determining the reasonable amount of attorneyâ€™s fees to award, the court should consider the nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered, the time necessarily devoted to the case, counselâ€™s professional standing, the contingency of compensation, the beneficial results obtained, and the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).\r\nThe family court clearly considered the relevant factors in making an award of attorneyâ€™s fees and in setting the amount.Â  The court considered the beneficial results obtained by Wife, the fault of the Husband in the divorce, and the financial situation of the parties. While our reversal of the imputation of income could affect the family courtâ€™s determination of Husbandâ€™s superior financial position, we believe Wife is nonetheless entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees based upon our review of the record.Â  \r\nAdditionally, the court did not err in the amount of the attorneyâ€™s fees as Wife was awarded only a portion of her outstanding attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Even though Wife paid a small portion of her fees using marital money, the court did not award her an unreasonable amount given the Glasscock factors, even if the amount she previously paid was added to the award.Â  Accordingly, we find the court did not abuse its discretion in awarding Wife $10,000.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nFurthermore, to the extent Husband asserts the court erred in denying his request for a Qualified Domestic Relations Order[2] for the payment of the award of attorneyâ€™s fees, we find Husband abandoned this issue given his argument consists of two sentences without any citation to authority. See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (noting that where a party fails to cite any supporting authority or where the argument is merely a conclusory statement, the issue is deemed abandoned on appeal); R &amp; G Constr., Inc. v. Lowcountry Regâ€™l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424, 437, 540 S.E.2d 113, 120 (Ct. App. 2000) (deeming an issue abandoned if the appellantâ€™s brief treats it in a conclusory manner).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the family court did not err in awarding Wife permanent periodic alimony, notwithstanding her testimony that she desired a certain amount for a fixed time period.Â  We conclude the amount of the alimony was proper and did not give Wife credit for expenses related to her daughterâ€™s schooling.Â  We reverse the family courtâ€™s imputation of income to Husband, but find the amount of alimony awarded should not be altered.\r\nMany of the issues regarding the division of the marital estate were not properly preserved for review on appeal, including the valuation of the Wifeâ€™s retirement account.Â  On the merits, we conclude the family court properly divided the marital estate with the exception of the credit card debt.Â  The court properly included the amount of Husbandâ€™s severance agreement with Springs and the down payment on his condominium in marital property.Â  In terms of the KKB partnership payment, we find the court erred in declining to find it constituted marital property.Â  However, we find no reversible error given the payment had already been disposed of in paying for daughterâ€™s tuition.Â  We find the Wife did not dissipate income from the sale of the Simpsonville home.Â  Finally, we find the court erred in its division of the credit card debt and allocate that debt consistent with the instructions in this opinion.Â  We find the court properly awarded Wife attorneyâ€™s fees after considering all relevant factors.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the decision of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND MODIFIED IN PART.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â Â  Section 9-18-10(9) defines â€œQualified domestic relations orderâ€ as follows:\r\n\r\n  â€œQualified domestic relations orderâ€ means a domestic relations order which creates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payeeâ€™s right, or assigns to an alternate payee the right, to receive all or a portion of a benefit payable with respect to a member or retired member under a retirement system, which directs that retirement system to disburse benefits to the alternate payee, and which meets the requirements of this chapter. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 9-18-10(9) (Supp. 2004).Â  Section 9-18-20 further explains:\r\n\r\n  A qualified domestic relations order may order that all or any part of any (1) retirement benefit, (2) withdrawal or refund of contributions, (3) disability benefit, or (4) death benefit that becomes payable under the retirement system on account of the member or retired member, instead be paid by the system to the alternate payee.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 9-18-20(A) (Supp. 2004) (Emphasis added); Smith v. S.C. Retirement Sys., 336 S.C. 505, 514, 520 S.E.2d 339, 344 (Ct.

Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    PER CURIAM:Â  Kaye Blackwell appeals from her conviction for possession of methamphetamine, arguing the trial judge erred by allowing the primary arresting officer to testify that Blackwell told him she was not willing to cooperate with the police.Â  We affirm.\r\n    FACTS\r\n    On May 5, 2003, officers executed a search warrant for Blackwellâ€™s residence.Â  When police entered the trailer, they found Blackwell in the bathroom, standing over the toilet.Â  The toilet had just been flushed and an officer retrieved several bags of methamphetamine from the swirling water.Â  To get to the toilet, the officer pushed Blackwell into the bathtub.Â  After obtaining the bags, the officer helped Blackwell out of the tub.Â  At that time, the officer found a white pill bottle laying in the tub.Â  When the officer later opened the bottle, he discovered that it contained various glassine baggies.Â  Of the bags tested, the bags combined contained a total of .31 grams of methamphetamine.Â  Blackwell initially told the officers the drugs were for her personal use; however, she later stated they belonged to an unidentified male, who was found in the living room of the trailer.Â  On June 22 and 23, 2004, Blackwell was tried for possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute.Â  The jury found Blackwell guilty of possession of methamphetamine.Â  The judge sentenced her to five years imprisonment, fined her $5,000, and ordered her to undergo treatment for substance abuse.Â  Blackwell now appeals.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBlackwell argues the trial judge erred by allowing the primary arresting officer to testify that Blackwell told him she was not willing to cooperate with the police because the testimony was inadmissible and unfairly prejudicial.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn criminal cases, an appellate court reviews errors of law only.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  â€œA courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of legal error that results in prejudice to the defendant.â€Â  State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 377, 580 S.E.2d 785, 793 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œA trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding the comparative probative value and prejudicial effect of evidence should be reversed only in â€˜exceptional circumstances.â€™â€ Â State v. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 357, 543 S.E.2d 586, 593 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nError in criminal prosecution is harmless error when it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.Â  State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985).Â  In this case, there was abundant evidence in the record from which the jury could have found Blackwell guilty, notwithstanding the officerâ€™s testimony.Â  Blackwell was found in her home, standing over a toilet that contained several bags of methamphetamines.Â  See State v. Hudson, 277 S.C. 200, 203, 284 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1981) (holding that where an officer retrieved three cellophane bags containing white powder from the toilet before they could be flushed away, there was sufficient evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant constructively possessed heroin with intent to distribute); State v. Bowers, 301 S.C. 457, 461, 392 S.E.2d 482, 485 (Ct.

Wright Turbeville, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-026\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2006 â€“ Filed January 12, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Harry C. Wilson, Jr., of Sumter, for Appellant.\r\n        Ryan A. McLeod, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Grant R. Head (Husband) appeals the family courtâ€™s order finding him in contempt for failure to pay Deborah C. Head (Wife) alimony pursuant to a temporary order.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn February 29, 2004, the family court issued a temporary order that required Husband to pay Wife alimony in the amount of $2,000 per month beginning on February 16, 2004.Â  The court also awarded Husband temporary possession of the marital home and held him responsible for all expenses related to the home.Â  Additionally, the court ordered Husband to continue the $450 monthly payments on the Wifeâ€™s vehicle.Â  Subsequently, Husband filed a motion for reconsideration pursuant to Rule 59(e) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  In his motion, Husband requested that the family court eliminate several of his financial obligations, particularly the order to pay alimony.Â  In the alternative, Husband requested the court reduce the amount of alimony.Â  After a hearing, the family court denied Husbandâ€™s motion.Â  \r\nAs a result of Husbandâ€™s failure to pay alimony for four months, Wife filed a Rule to Show Cause on May 13, 2004, seeking to hold Husband in contempt, requiring him to pay back alimony, and requesting attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  After a hearing, the family court found Husband in contempt and sentenced him to an indeterminate period not to exceed six months incarceration unless he paid Wife $8,000 in back alimony and $1,585.08 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  According to Wife, Husband paid the entire amount in cash within two hours of the hearing.Â  Husband appeals.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA determination of contempt ordinarily resides in the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Whetstone v. Whetstone, 309 S.C. 227, 233, 420 S.E.2d 877, 880-81 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  â€œThis court will reverse a trial courtâ€™s decision regarding contempt only if it is without evidentiary support or is an abuse of discretion.â€Â  First Union Natâ€™l Bank v. First Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. of South Carolina, 346 S.C. 462, 466, 551 S.E.2d 301, 303&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs either when the court is controlled by some error of law or where the order, based upon findings of fact, lacks evidentiary support.â€Â  Townsend v. Townsend, 356 S.C. 70, 73, 587 S.E.2d 118, 119 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in finding him in contempt.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe power to punish for contempt is inherent in all courts and is essential to the preservation of order in judicial proceedings.â€Â  In re Diggs, 344 S.C. 434, 434, 544 S.E.2d 632, 632&nbsp;(2001).Â  A courtâ€™s contempt power arises when an individual willfully disobeys an order of the court.Â  Id.; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1350 (Supp. 2004) (A party may be found in contempt of court for the willful violation of a lawful court order.).Â  â€œA willful act is defined as one â€˜done voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done; that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.â€™â€Â  Spartanburg County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1988) (quoting Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1434 (5th ed. 1979)).Â  â€œ[B]efore a court may find a person in contempt, the record must clearly and specifically reflect the contemptuous conduct.â€Â  Widman v. Widman, 348 S.C. 97, 119, 557 S.E.2d 693, 705 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nâ€œIn a proceeding for contempt for violation of a court order, the moving party must show the existence of a court order and the facts establishing the respondentâ€™s noncompliance with the order.â€Â  Hawkins v. Mullins, 359 S.C. 497, 501, 597 S.E.2d 897, 899 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œOnce the moving party has made out a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the respondent to establish his or her defense and inability to comply with the order.â€Â  Widman, 348 S.C. at 120, 557 S.E.2d at 705.\r\nAt the conclusion of the contempt hearing, the court explained that its ruling was based on the following findings:Â  (1) Husband had the ability to pay the $2,000 per month alimony but had refused to comply with his obligation because he disagreed with the amount set in the temporary order; (2) Husband chose to pay other bills and expenses rather than pay alimony; (3) Husband had the ability to pay given there was evidence that he received cash income and that his tree service business had made a profit for the years 2000 through 2003. \r\nBecause there is evidence to support the courtâ€™s ruling, we find the court did not abuse its discretion in holding Husband in contempt.[1]Â Â Â  It is undisputed that Husband failed to pay Wife any alimony despite being ordered to do so.Â  Thus, the question becomes whether his failure to pay was willful.Â  \r\nHusband acknowledges that he failed to comply with his alimony obligation; however, he contends his failure to do so was not willful given his financial situation.Â  He asserts he did not have the ability to pay the alimony because his other expenses exceeded his income.Â Â  Specifically, he claims his tree service business has not been profitable for the past few years and there is outstanding debt on the partiesâ€™ former photo business.Â  As a result of these business failures, Husband claims he has incurred significant credit card debt and has had to refinance the marital home and borrow money to reduce the business expenses.Â  Additionally, in mitigation, Husband points out that in order to avoid repossession of Wifeâ€™s vehicle he paid the balance of the loan in the amount of $5,800.\r\nAlthough Husband testified regarding his financial difficulties involving his tree business, he confirmed Wifeâ€™s testimony that he has received cash payments for his work and that some of the payment checks were made out to him individually as opposed to the business.Â  He admitted that he had received a late-model Porsche as payment for his work.Â  Husband also acknowledged that he paid off the $5,800 balance on the Wifeâ€™s vehicle, which was more than the $3,000 that was required to avoid repossession.Â  He also testified that he made more than the minimum payments on his credit cards and has kept his utility and cable bills current.Â  Additionally, Husband admitted that he was current with his child support obligation from a previous marriage and, in fact, had on occasion paid more than the required amount.Â  Husband also acknowledged that since the temporary order was issued he has paid for the services of a private investigator in preparation for the final divorce hearing.Â  Finally, the question regarding whether Husbandâ€™s business was profitable based on his method of depreciating the business assets was a credibility determination for which we defer to the family court.Â  See Brown v. Malloy, 345 S.C. 113, 119, 546 S.E.2d 195, 198 (Ct. App. 2001) (deferring to family court where decision was dependent on credibility and family court saw the witnesses and heard the testimony).\r\nII.\r\nHusband argues the award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife should be reversed if this court finds the family court abused its discretion in finding Husband in contempt.Â  In light of our decision regarding the contempt finding, we also affirm the award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs to Wife as a contempt sanction.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the decision of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., and HUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â Â  Given this appeal is presented to us in the posture of a contempt action based on a temporary order, we express no opinion as to the final decree of divorce, particularly concerning the award of alimony.Â  We emphasize that our analysis is strictly confined to determining whether there is evidence to support the family courtâ€™s decision to hold Husband in contempt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-027","title":"Costenbader v.

Costenbader (Wife) appeals the family court order granting her divorce from Glenn A. Costenbader (Husband).Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part. \r\nFACTS\r\nOn October 7, 1972, Wife and Husband married.Â  Thirty-one years later, on September 5, 2003, they divorced.Â  Wife and Husband began their marriage in Pennsylvania.Â  In 1987, they moved to Winnsboro, South Carolina, where Wife worked at an Advanced Auto Parts store and Husband worked at a Mack Truck plant.Â  In the Fall of 2001, Husband discovered the Mack Truck plant was closing.Â  \r\nEarlier that year, on February 7, 2001, Wife sought a divorce based on Husbandâ€™s infidelity and intoxication.Â  Wife claimed, and Husband admitted, Husband committed adultery multiple times during their marriage.Â  Wife alleged Husband would frequent a local bar called Grizzly Jacks each day after work.Â  She complained of his excessive drinking at the bar as well as his corresponding absence from the marital home.Â  \r\nThe family court granted Wifeâ€™s divorce based on Husbandâ€™s adultery.Â  Initially, the family court granted Wife alimony of $500 per month; however, the court reconsidered and denied this award because it found Husbandâ€™s marital misconduct did not affect the economic circumstances of the parties.Â  The court concluded the Jackson Creek Road property, which Husband purchased with money he inherited from his parents, was nonmarital property.[1]Â  The court apportioned the marital estate 50/50.Â  Finally, the court granted Wife attorneyâ€™s fees of $2,000, the amount of the initial retainer, although Wife requested $5,500.Â  \r\nPresently, Wife works as a rural mail carrier.Â  She makes between $35,000 and $40,000 a year, less expenses for the upkeep of her vehicle.Â  Husband has been unemployed since 2002.Â  Wife and Husband had three children during the marriage, all of whom have reached the age of majority.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n    Whether the family court erred in denying alimony previously awarded to Wife.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.\r\n    Whether the family court erred in concluding the Jackson Creek Road property was not part of the marital estate. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    III.&nbsp;\r\n    Whether the family court erred in apportioning the marital estate. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    IV.\r\n    Whether the family court erred in granting a divorce based solely on Husband&rsquo;s adultery.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    V.&nbsp;\r\n    Whether the family court erred in awarding attorney&rsquo;s fees of $2,000 rather than the $5,500 requested by Wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    VI.\r\n    Whether the family court erred in holding Wife in contempt. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    VII.\r\n    Whether the family court erred in granting Husband&rsquo;s motion for reconsideration. \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn an appeal from the family court, the appellate court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 569 S.E.2d 367 (2002).Â  This broad scope of review does not require the appellate court to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 561 S.E.2d 610 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Rather, the appellate court should be cognizant of the fact the family court was in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Holler v. Holler, 364 S.C. 256, 612 S.E.2d 469 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Alimony \r\nWife argues the family court erred in denying her alimony.Â  We agree.\r\nThe decision to grant or deny alimony is within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 282, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002).Â  An abuse of discretion transpires when the family court is controlled by an error of law or when the findings of fact are without evidentiary support.Â  Id.Â  Section 20-3-130(C) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004) outlines thirteen factors the family court must consider and weigh when it determines an alimony award.Â  One of these factors is â€œmarital misconductâ€ that affects â€œthe economic circumstances of the parties.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C)(10).Â  â€œNo one factor is dispositive.â€Â  Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 184, 554 S.E.2d 421, 425 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œAlimony is awarded as a substitute for support normally incident to a marital relationship and should place the supported spouse, as nearly as possible, in the same position he or she enjoyed during the marriage.â€Â  Roberson v. Roberson, 359 S.C. 384, 390-91, 597 S.E.2d 840, 843 (Ct. App. 2004). \r\nIn this case, the family court terminated the $500 monthly alimony it initially granted to Wife, because it found Wife presented no evidence Husbandâ€™s marital misconduct affected the economic circumstances of the parties.Â  We find the record replete with evidence to the contrary and reverse the family court on this issue.Â  First, Husband admitted he had sex with three other women while married to Wife.Â  Second, Husband conceded to drinking until drunk, and admitted Wife picked him up from Grizzly Jacks multiple times as a result of his intoxication.Â  On such occasions, Wife would have to drive Husband back to Grizzly Jacks in the morning, so he could pick up his truck to drive to work.Â  \r\nWife testified Husband went to Grizzly Jacks just about every day after work, where he would spend hundreds of dollars each month on alcohol.Â  His absence from the marital home made it difficult for Wife to make marital decisions and raise their three children.Â  His intoxication lead to numerous arrests for driving under the influence, which lead to increased insurance rates.Â  Based on these facts, the family court initially awarded Wife $500 monthly alimony.Â  The family court later terminated this award for reasons not explained in the order nor manifested by the record.Â  Because we believe the record shows Husbandâ€™s marital conduct affected the economic circumstances of the parties, we find the family court erred in terminating the alimony it initially awarded Wife. \r\nTherefore, we find the $500 monthly alimony is proper to place Wife in the same position she enjoyed prior to this divorce action.Â  During the marriage, Husband made significantly more money than Wife.Â  Husband testified he contributed 75% of the marital income over the course of their marriage.Â  Moreover, Husbandâ€™s unemployment status is not entirely outside of his control.Â  When Husband heard about the plant closing in Winnsboro, he had the option of transferring to other plants, including plants in Georgia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.Â  He only attempted to transfer to the Pennsylvania plant because he did not want to live where the other plants were located.Â  He was unable to obtain a transfer to the Pennsylvania plant, and has been unemployed since 2002.Â  We do not believe Husband incapable of finding employment, and in light of the purpose of alimony to place Wife in the same position she enjoyed during the marriage, we reinstate the $500 monthly alimony to Wife from Husband.Â  \r\nII.Â Â Marital Property\r\nWife argues the family court erred in omitting the Jackson Creek Road real property from the marital estate.Â  We disagree. \r\n\r\n  The term â€œmarital propertyâ€ . . . means all real and personal property which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation as provided in Â§ 20-7-472 regardless of how legal title is held, except the following, which constitute nonmarital property:\r\n  (1) property acquired by either party by inheritance, devise, bequest, or gift from a party other than the spouse;\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2004).Â  The burden of showing an exemption under section 20-7-473 is upon the party claiming the property acquired during the marriage is nonmarital.Â  Widman v. Widman, 348 S.C. 97, 557 S.E.2d 693 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Nonmarital property can be transmuted into marital property if the property at issue is (1) so commingled with marital property as to be untraceable, (2) jointly titled, or (3) utilized by the parties in support of the marriage or in some other manner as to evidence an intent by the parties to make it marital property.Â  Greene v. Greene, 351 S.C. 329, 338, 569 S.E.2d 393, 398 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  The party claiming transmutation has the burden of showing the parties regarded the property at issue as marital property during the marriage.Â  Id.\r\nHusband testified, and Wife did not dispute, the Jackson Road Property was acquired by inheritance.Â  Therefore, Husband showed this property was exempted under section 20-7-473, and should be considered nonmarital property.Â  Wife argues the Jackson Road Property should be transmuted because they treated it as marital property.Â  She claims she helped Husband move brush and burn trash on the property.Â  Husband claims the Jackson Road Property was not transmuted, and produced a deed showing the property was entitled to Husband only.Â  Based on these facts, Wife failed to carry the burden of showing the parties considered Jackson Road Property marital property.Â  See Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 295-96, 372 S.E.2d 107, 111 (Ct. App. 1988) (â€œThe mere use of separate property to support the marriage, without some additional evidence of intent to treat it as property of the marriage, is not sufficient to establish transmutation.â€).\r\nThe family court correctly found the Jackson Road Property was not marital property, because Husband purchased it with inheritance money, nor transmuted property, because it was not commingled with marital property, titled solely to Husband, and not utilized in a way that evidenced an intent to make it marital property.Â Â  \r\nIII.Â Â Â Â  Equitable Division\r\nWife argues the family court erred in apportioning the marital property.Â  We disagree. \r\nâ€œThe family courtâ€™s apportionment of marital property will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Roberson, 359 S.C. at 389, 597 S.E.2d at 842-43.Â  â€œThe family court has wide discretion in determining how marital property is to be distributed.â€Â  Greene, 351 S.C. at 341, 569 S.E.2d at 400.Â  Section 20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004) outlines fifteen factors the family court should weigh when apportioning the marital property, and an appellate court will affirm the family court if it can be determined the family court addressed these factors. Roberson, 359 S.C. at 389, 597 S.E.2d at 843. \r\nThe family court sufficiently addressed the factors outlined in section 20-7-472.Â  The family court considered the age of the parties, the marital misconduct of Husband, the value of the marital property, the income of each spouse, the health of each party, the Husbandâ€™s nonmarital property, alimony, and other relevant factors when it apportioned the marital property 50/50.Â  We find no abuse of discretion. Â Â \r\nIV.Â Â Â Â  Grounds for Divorce\r\nWife argues the family court erred in granting Wifeâ€™s divorce based solely on Husbandâ€™s adultery.Â  We disagree. \r\nSection 20-3-10 of the South Carolina Code (1985) provides that â€œ[n]o divorce from the bonds of matrimony shall be granted except upon one or more of the following grounds,â€ including â€œadulteryâ€ or â€œhabitual drunkenness . . . .â€ (emphasis added).Â  Nothing in section 20-3-10 mandates the family court must grant a divorce on all possible grounds listed: any one ground will suffice.Â  Because Husband admitted his adultery, the family court could, and did, grant a divorce on that ground alone.Â  We find Wifeâ€™s argument to be without merit.Â  \r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nWife argues the family court erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees of $2,000 rather than the $5,500 Wife requested.Â  We disagree.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees lies within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Roberson, 359 S.C. at 392, 597 S.E.2d at 844.Â  Section 20-3-120 of the South Carolina Code (1985) provides:\r\n\r\n  In every divorce action from the bonds of matrimony either party may in his or her complaint or answer or by petition pray for the allowance to him or her of alimony and suit money and for the allowance of such alimony and suit money pendente lite.Â  If such claim shall appear well-founded the court shall allow a reasonable sum therefor.\r\n\r\nIn determining the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees to award, the family court should consider the following six factors: (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) professional standing of counsel; (4) contingency of compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained; (6) customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991). \r\n In light of the fact Husband admitted his adultery from the outset of the case, Wifeâ€™s divorce action was fairly straightforward.Â  We find the family court did not abuse its discretion in awarding Wife $2,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees rather than $5,500.\r\nÂ VI.Â Â Â  Contempt\r\nWife argues the family court erred in holding Wife in contempt.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe determination of contempt is within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Smith v. Smith, 359 S.C. 393, 396, 597 S.E.2d 188, 189 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Contempt results from the willful disobedience of a court order.Â  Id.Â  A willful act is one done voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent not to do something the law requires to be done.Â  Id.Â  A party cannot be held in contempt for violating a court order that fails to apprise that party in clear and certain terms of the actions that must be taken to satisfy the order.Â  Phillips v. Phillips, 288 S.C. 185, 188, 341 S.E.2d 132, 133 (1986) (â€œOne may not be convicted of contempt for violating a court order which fails to tell him in definite terms what he must do.â€).\r\nThe family court ordered each party to execute any deeds necessary to effectuate the apportionment of the marital estate.Â  Wife was required to deliver to Husband deeds to property in Pennsylvania and Florida.Â  These properties were clearly indicated in an exhibit to the family court order.Â  Wife intentionally did not deliver these deeds.Â  Accordingly, the family court did not abuse its discretion when it held Wife in contempt for failing to deliver these deeds to Husband.Â Â  \r\nVII.Â Â  Motion for Reconsideration \r\nWife argues the family court erred in granting Husbandâ€™s motion for reconsideration.Â  We disagree. \r\nWife appears to argue that because the issues raised by Husband in his Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend judgment were not heard by oral argument, the family court erred in granting Husbandâ€™s motion.Â  Rule 59(f) expressly provides a Rule 59(e) motion â€œmay in the discretion of the court be determined on briefs filed by the parties without oral argument.â€Â  In this case, the family court chose to rule on Husbandâ€™s motion without oral argument.Â  Because the decision to grant the motion without oral argument is clearly within the family courtâ€™s discretion, Wife should have filed a brief in opposition to Husbandâ€™s motion if she wished to contest the issues raised by Husbandâ€™s motion.Â  Accordingly, the family court did not err in granting Husbandâ€™s motion. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n Therefore, we hold the family court erred in terminating Wifeâ€™s alimony.Â  We reinstate the $500 monthly alimony to Wife from Husband.Â  The remaining issues are affirmed.Â  \r\nThe order of the family court isÂ Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\r\nGOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  There are two relevant tracts of real property on Jackson Creek Road.Â  The first, located at 10448 Jackson Creek Road, is the marital home awarded to Wife.Â  The second, located at 2202 Jackson Creek Road, is the parcel of land the family court determined to be nonmarital property.Â  The Jackson Creek Road property referred to here is the latter tract located at 2202 Jackson Creek Road.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-028","title":"SC Department of Social Services v.

Anderson, of Orangeburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is an appeal from a family court order terminating parental rights.Â  Melissa Wilson Evans argues the family court erred by failing to give adequate consideration to the recommendation of the guardian ad litem in making its decision.Â Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nEvans is the biological mother of Melissa Hope Evans (Hope). This appeal arises from the family courtâ€™s termination of Evansâ€™s parental rights on July 16, 2004, for the following statutory grounds: (1) Hope had been in foster care under the responsibility of the State for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months; (2) Evans failed to remedy the conditions that caused that removal; and (3) Evans failed to support or visit Hope for a period of six months prior to the commencement of the termination of parental rights proceedings.Â  Â \r\nHope was born on January 23, 2001.Â  Two days later the South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) placed her into emergency protective custody when Evans and Hope both tested positive for cocaine.Â  On January 29, 2001, the family court held a probable cause hearing, and Evans, who lived with her mother, was granted temporary custody of Hope.Â  Evans attended Lowcountry Crossroad Treatment Facility and was later discharged.Â  Evans then began an outpatient program at the Dawn Center in Orangeburg.Â  \r\nOn August 22, 2001, Evans again tested positive for cocaine and DSS placed Hope in foster care.Â  Subsequently, the family court issued a formal notice of removal, which gave custody to DSS and granted Evans supervised visitation with Hope.Â  The family court also ordered Evans to comply with a treatment plan which included drug rehabilitation and parenting classes.Â  \r\nOn November 3, 2001, because of Evansâ€™s relapse, the Dawn Center recommended Evans enter an inpatient program rather than an outpatient program.Â  Evans disagreed with the recommendation of inpatient treatment, and has not returned to the Dawn Center.Â  Although Evans completed the parenting classes, she has not completed a drug treatment program.Â  Â \r\nOn February 21, 2003, DSS filed an action for termination of parental rights.Â  During the hearing, Evans testified police arrested her for possession of cocaine on April 11, 2003.Â  Since her arrest, Evans has been working for the Sheriffâ€™s department as an informant.Â  Because of her cooperation, no charges have been brought against her.Â  Also during the hearing, the guardian testified that he believed the petition to terminate parental rights should be dismissed and in his opinion, Evans impressed him as someone who truly wanted her child back.Â  The guardian further testified he felt DSS should help Evans with job training or some other kind of economic assistance.Â  However, the guardian also testified that he had never met with Hope nor observed Hopeâ€™s relationship with her foster family.Â  \r\nFollowing the hearing, the family court found, pursuant to Section 20-7-1572 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004), Hope had been removed from Evansâ€™s home for more than six months, and Evans failed to visit.Â  Moreover, Hope had been in foster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months.Â  Additionally, even though DSS demonstrated a reasonable and meaningful effort to provide rehabilitative services, Evans failed to remedy the conditions which led to Hopeâ€™s removal.Â  The family court also found termination to be in Hopeâ€™s best interest and therefore terminated Evansâ€™s parental rights.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn a termination of parental rights (TPR) case, â€œthe appellate court has jurisdiction to examine the entire record to determine the facts according to its view of the evidence.â€ Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579-80, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing Richland County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Earles, 330 S.C. 24, 32, 496 S.E.2d 864, 868 (1998)).Â  In our examination, the best interest of the child is our paramount consideration.Â  Roe, 353 S.C. at 579, 578 S.E.2d at 735.Â  Additionally, the grounds for TPR must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999) (citing Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 747-48 (1982) (holding â€œ[b]efore a State may sever completely and irrevocably the rights of parents in their natural child, due process requires that the State support its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidenceâ€)).Â  â€œOur broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the findings below or ignore the fact the trial judge was in a better position to asses the credibility of the witnesses.â€Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 293, 547 S.E.2d 506, 509 (Ct. App. 2001) (citing Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996)).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe sole issue on appeal is whether the family court erred by failing to give adequate consideration to the recommendation of the guardian ad litem.Â  For the reasons set out below, we find clear and convincing evidence supports the family courtâ€™s order terminating parental rights.\r\nIn Shainwald v. Shainwald, we stated that â€œmuch of the criticism of guardians ad litem stems from the failure . . .Â  to recognize the proper function of a guardian ad litem.â€ 302 S.C. 453, 457, 395 S.E.2d 441, 444 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  Properly understood, the guardian functions as a â€œrepresentative of the court, appointed to assist the court in making its determination of custody by advocating for the best interest of the children and by providing the court with an objective view.â€Â  Patel v. Patel, 347 S.C. 281, 287, 555 S.E.2d 386, 389 (2001) (citing Fleming v. Asbill, 326 S.C. 49,Â­Â­ 57, 483 S.E.2d 751, 755 (1997)).Â  The role of the guardian ad litem in making a custody recommendation is to â€œaid, not direct, the court.â€ Clear v. Clear, 331 S.C. 186, 191, 500 S.E.2d 790, 792 (Ct. App. 1998);Â  see also Shainwald, 302 S.C. at 457, 395 S.E.2d at 443 (â€œ[T]he guardian ad litem does not usurp the judgeâ€™s function; he aids it.â€) (citation omitted).Â  The family court is not required to adhere to the guardianâ€™s recommendation regarding custody.Â  See, e.g., Shirley v. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324, 340, 536 S.E.2d 427, 435 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œBased on our review of the record, the judge gave proper weight and consideration to the recommendation delivered by the guardian ad litem and did not abuse his discretion in refusing to follow the recommendation.â€); Pountain v. Pountain, 332 S.C. 130, 138, 503 S.E.2d 757, 761 (Ct. App. 1998) (finding no abuse of discretion where the family court considered but ultimately rejected the guardianâ€™s recommendation). \r\nTurning to the case at bar, the family court, after due and deliberate consideration of the guardianâ€™s testimony, found termination of Evansâ€™s parental rights was in Hopeâ€™s best interest.Â  The evidence presented by DSS showed Evans tested positive for cocaine and failed to complete drug abuse treatment.Â  Further, she was arrested for possession of cocaine but was not prosecuted for the offense due to her agreement to work as an unpaid drug informant for the Orangeburg County Sheriffâ€™s Department.Â  The family court found that Evans was still involved in a setting where illegal drugs were present, which was not in Hopeâ€™s best interest.Â  Additionally, Evans failed to pay child support, her visits were sporadic at best, and Hope has been in foster care for fifteen of the last twenty-two months.Â  Most notably, the family court also found, in evaluating Evansâ€™s demeanor, her testimony of sobriety was not credible.Â  Despite the guardianâ€™s testimony that the petition for terminating Evansâ€™s parental rights should be dismissed, we agree with the family court that Hopeâ€™s best interest would be served by termination.\r\nWe reiterate that the family court judge is in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses.Â  â€œ[W]here the evidence presented in the record adequately supports the findings of the trial judge, due deference should be given to his judgment based on his superior position in weighing such evidence.Â  This is especially true in cases involving the welfare and best interests of children.â€Â  Aiken County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Wilcox, 304 S.C. 90, 93, 403 S.E.2d 142, 144 (Ct. App. 1991) (citations omitted). The family court adequately considered the facts in light of what would be in Hopeâ€™s best interest and made detailed and specific findings.[2]Â  Based on our review of the record, we find the family court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to follow the guardian ad litemâ€™s recommendation.Â  Accordingly the decision of the family court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE, WILLIAMS, JJ., AND CURETON, A.J., CONCUR.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument, pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.&nbsp; \r\n[2] Evansâ€™s also argues the family court failed to make a finding as to why it rejected the recommendation of the guardian.Â  This argument has absolutely no merit. The record is replete with the family courtâ€™s findings as to why Evansâ€™s parental rights were terminated.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-029","title":"Trask v.

Burke, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\n        Thomas A. Holloway, of Beaufort, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Michael Hill appeals from an order denying his motion to compel arbitration.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn May 30, 1997, Mary Garrison, in her capacity as trustee of the Virginia T. Howell Revocable Trust, opened a brokerage account for the purchase of annuities with Robert Thomas Securities, Inc., through their Myrtle Beach branch office, Coastal Investor Services, Inc., and their employee, Michael Hill. The contract between Garrison and Hill incorporated by reference a &ldquo;Client Agreement&rdquo; that contained a binding arbitration clause, which Garrison acknowledged receipt of by her signature. The Client Agreement contained an arbitration clause that applied to all disputes arising under the contract and bound all successors in interest to the terms of the agreement. Neither Garrison nor Hill signed the Client Agreement. Garrison died on May 1, 2001. \r\nOn August 26, 2002, Louise Trask and James Garrison, who are successor trustees to the Howell Trust, filed an action against Hill, alleging that Hill was negligent and breached his fiduciary duty by selling Garrison a brokerage account with an incorrect designated beneficiary. In his answer, Hill alleged that the brokerage agreement underlying the action was subject to binding arbitration. Hill filed a motion to stay the action against him and to compel arbitration. On December 15, 2003, after a hearing on Hill&rsquo;s motion to compel arbitration, Judge John declined to rule on the motion, continuing the matter until the parties conducted limited discovery that was restricted to the issue of arbitrability. However, in the intervening months between the initial hearing and the second hearing on September 14, 2004, the only discovery conducted was Hill&rsquo;s sua sponte production of his entire documentary file to respondents in May 2004. After the second hearing on the motion, Judge Baxley issued his order denying Hill&rsquo;s motion to compel arbitration. Hill appeals. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHill argues the trial court erred by failing to compel arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act because there was a binding contract, evidencing intent to arbitrate any disputes arising under the contract.Â  We agree. \r\nâ€œThe question of the arbitrability of a claim is an issue for judicial determination, unless the parties provide otherwise.â€Â  Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 596, 553 S.E.2d 110, 118 (2001).Â  â€œDeterminations of arbitrability are subject to de novo review.â€Â  Stokes v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 351 S.C. 606, 609, 571 S.E.2d 711, 713 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\n\r\nâ€œThe policy of the United States and South Carolina is to favor arbitration of disputes.â€Â  Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 596, 553 S.E.2d at 118.Â  â€œ[U]nless the court can say with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible to an interpretation that covers the dispute, arbitration should be ordered.â€Â  Id. at 597, 553 S.E.2d at 118.Â  The arbitration agreement in the instant case states that if the parties cannot resolve a dispute or controversy by mediation, â€œthereafter, any unsettled dispute or controversy will be resolved by arbitration . . . in accordance with the United States Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code).â€Â  Therefore, any claim pursuant to the contract is subject to arbitration.Â  \r\nThe arbitration clause in this case is contained in the Client Agreement.Â  Garrison signed a contract that stated, â€œBy signing below, I acknowledge that I have received, read, understood, and agree to abide by all the terms and conditions set forth in the Client Agreement Incorporated herein by this reference.Â  The Client Agreement contains a binding arbitration clause and other provisions substantially affecting my rights.â€Â  Thus, Garrison and her successors are bound by the arbitration clause in the Client Agreement.Â Â Â  Â \r\nAdditionally, â€œ[u]nless the parties have contracted to the contrary, the FAA [Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 1 to 16 (West 1999)] applies in federal or state court to any arbitration agreement regarding a transaction that in fact involves interstate commerce, regardless of whether or not the parties contemplated an interstate transaction.â€Â  Munoz v. Green Tree Financial Corp., 343 S.C. 531, 538, 542 S.E.2d 360, 363 (2001).Â  Neither party in this case disputes the FAA applies to claims arising under the contract Garrison signed in 1997.Â  Therefore, the trial judge erred by applying South Carolina arbitration law and failing to order arbitration in this case.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-030","title":"State v.

Savitz III, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Deborah R.J. Shupe, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Thomas E. Pope, of York, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this appeal of a guilty plea, Stephen Tyrone Simmons argues the trial court erred in accepting his guilty plea because it was made conditional on his ability to appeal the denial of pre-trial motions.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS    \r\nOn April 27, 2002, York County narcotics officers instructed James Moore, a confidential informant, to contact Simmons and set up a deal over the telephone to purchase cocaine.Â  Moore and Simmons agreed to meet at a liquor store.Â  Simmons delivered to Moore what was later identified as 114.70 grams of cocaine.Â  The police videotaped the transaction between Simmons and Moore.Â  Simmons was apprehended, given his Miranda rights, which he waived, and confessed to delivering cocaine to Moore.\r\nIn July 2002, the York County Grand Jury indicted Simmons on one count of trafficking between 100 and 200 grams of cocaine.Â  The case was called for a jury trial on November 6, 2002.Â  Simmons proceeded pro se.Â  Prior to trial, Simmons submitted a Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) document to the trial court, moved to dismiss the claims against him based on this document, and moved to file a commercial lien against everyone involved in the prosecution.Â  The trial court denied the motion stating that it was unrelated to the criminal case at hand.Â  Simmons then moved to renounce his United States citizenship.Â  The trial court informed Simmons it did not have jurisdiction to grant such a request, and he would have to pursue the request in federal court. \r\nThe trial court impressed upon Simmons the importance of having representation, and Simmons decided that it was in his best interest to move forward with an attorney.Â  After a brief recess, Simmonsâ€™s counsel informed the trial court that Simmons wanted to plead guilty pursuant to an agreement with the State to allow a plea to the lesser charge of trafficking between 28 and 100 grams of cocaine, second offense, with a negotiated sentence of sixteen years.Â  In accordance with the plea agreement and negotiated sentence, Simmons was sentenced to sixteen years.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSimmons argues the trial court erred in accepting his guilty plea because it was made conditional on his ability to appeal the denial of his pre-trial motions concerning the UCC claim and the request to renounce his citizenship. We disagree. \r\nIn South Carolina, a guilty plea must be unconditional.Â  State v. Peppers, 346 S.C. 502, 504, 552 S.E.2d 288, 289 (2001).Â  If an accused attempts to attach any condition, the trial court must direct a plea of not guilty.Â  State v. Oâ€™Leary, 302 S.C. 17, 18, 393 S.E.2d 186, 187 (1990).Â  The basis for this rule â€œis the settled doctrine that a guilty plea constitutes a waiver of all prior claims of constitutional rights or deprivations thereof.â€Â  Peppers, 346 at 504, 552 S.E.2d at 289. \r\nRule 201, SCARC, provides an appeal â€œmay be taken, as provided by law, from any final judgment or appealable order.â€Â  However, it is error for defendants to preserve certain issues while entering pleas of guilty, and if a defendant does so, the plea is conditional and invalid.Â  See State v. Oâ€™Leary, 302 S.C. 17, 18, 393 S.E.2d 186, 187 (1990).Â  The issues Simmons sought to preserve for appeal are not issues that are prohibited from being preserved.Â  Generally, the issue of a conditional plea arises when a defendant seeks to preserve for appeal a challenge to the constitutionality of the underlying statute or preserve for appeal pre-trial motions concerning the deprivation of a constitutional right. Â \r\nIn Oâ€™Leary, the trial court accepted the defendantâ€™s plea of guilty to the offense of driving under suspension (â€œDUSâ€), conditioned, however, upon the defendantâ€™s right to appeal his constitutional challenges of the DUS statute.Â  Id. at 18, 393 S.E.2d at 187.Â  In finding Oâ€™Learyâ€™s plea to be conditional and invalid, the Supreme Court of South Carolina held that\r\n\r\n   [g]uilty pleas are unconditional and, if an accused attempts to attach any condition, the trial court must direct a plea of not guilty. . . . It is, thus, impermissible for a defendant to preserve constitutional issues while entertaining a guilty plea; the trial court may not accept the plea on such terms.\r\n\r\n    Id. (citations omitted).\r\nAdditionally, in the case of State v. Truesdale, 278 S.C. 368, 296 S.E.2d 528 (1982), the trial court reversed the defendantâ€™s conviction, following his conditional guilty plea.Â  In pre-trial motions, Truesdale sought a change of venue, a limitation on the use of peremptory challenges by the solicitor, and certain restrictions upon the disqualification of jurors for cause.Â  Id. at 369, 296 S.E.2d at 529.Â  These motions were denied, and Truesdale entered a plea of guilty.Â  The Supreme Court of South Carolina held the entrance of such a conditional guilty plea was improper, and it was error for the trial court to accept the pleas on such terms.Â  Id. at 370, 296 S.E.2d at 529.Â  It is important to note that prior to the trial court accepting Truesdaleâ€™s guilty plea, his counsel made an equivocating statement as follows: \r\n\r\n  However, to the extent that the denial of any of these three motions did, as we maintain, deny this young man a jury that was constitutionally selected, it would be my judgment and I think the record should reflect our position, that the plea is in fact the product of what we assert to be the deprivation of his constitutional rights.\r\n\r\nId. at 370, 296 S.E.2d at 528.Â  In the instant case, Simmons did not condition his plea on the appeal of his pre-trial motions, nor did Simmons make an equivocating statement denying his guilt while still pleading guilty.Â  He never attempted to reserve the right to later deny his guilt.Â  \r\nCourts have often upheld pleas that preserved certain issues not connected with the guilt.Â  In the case of State v. Downs, 361 S.C. 141, 604 S.E.2d 377 (2004), Downs reserved the right to present evidence that he committed the crime while he was mentally ill and moved forward with the guilty plea.Â  This court held that guilty but mentally ill (GBMI) is still guilty.Â  Id. at 146, 604 S.E.2d at 380.Â  The difference between guilty and GBMI pertains only to post-sentencing medical treatment, and therefore, Downsâ€™s guilty plea was unconditional.Â  Id.Â  This issue also arose in the case of Easter v. State, 355 S.C. 79, 584 S.E.2d 117 (2003).Â  The Supreme Court of South Carolina found that when Easter entered his guilty plea, but objected to his sentence, he did not enter an invalid, conditional guilty plea.Â  Id. at 81, 584 S.E.2d at 119.Â  â€œSentencing, although often combined with the admission of guilt in a hearing, is a separate issue from guilt and a distinct phase of the criminal process.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nBoth the Easter and Downs cases are similar to this case.Â  Here, Simmons sought pre-trial motions concerning a commercial lien and renouncing his United States citizenship.Â  Neither of these motions concerned his guilt.Â  In fact, when the trial court asked Simmons if he was â€œin fact guilty of trafficking powder cocaine,â€ Simmons replied â€œYes.â€Â  The trial court explained Simmonsâ€™s right to appeal and that by pleading guilty, he was â€œextinguishing some rights that you would have to raise on appeal.â€Â  Simmons was then given time to consult with his attorney concerning his appellate rights, and his attorney informed the trial court that Simmons understood those rights. \r\nSimmons did not attach a condition to his guilty plea.Â  Simmons did not condition his plea on the outcome of an appeal of his pre-trial motions.Â  Simmons merely sought to preserve his right to appeal motions that did not concern his guilt.Â  Therefore, the trial court did not err in accepting Simmonsâ€™s guilty plea because it was not an invalid conditional plea.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-031","title":"State v.

Elliott, Assistant Attorney General David A. Spencer, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Robert M. Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Charles Henderson appeals his convictions for possession with intent to distribute cocaine in proximity of a school and trafficking in cocaine. Henderson argues the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence due to a defective search warrant and by using four separate verdict forms.Â  We reverse and remand.[1] Â Â \r\nFACTS\r\nCharles Henderson, Kevin Covert, and others were present in Covertâ€™s house in Greenville County when police searched it on September 26, 2002.Â  When the officers entered the house they found Henderson in the living room with a coffee grinder containing a white powder substance, small plastic bags of white powered substance, a cutting agent, sifting instruments, and an electronic scale, all in front of him on a coffee table.Â  A cell phone box on the couch next to him contained a large plastic bag of cocaine, weighing 441.50 grams.Â  Cocaine, weighing 22.89 grams, was found on the coffee table.Â  Two smaller quantities of cocaine, weighing 6.47 grams and 1.62 grams, were also recovered.Â  Police also found $1,950 on the floor in front of the couch.Â  Additionally, police found a pistol on a bookshelf.Â  Henderson was the only person in the living room.Â  Covert was found in a bedroom on the other side of the house.Â  A holster for a gun, a 9-mm. magazine, and several dozen rounds of ammunition were found in an adjacent bedroom that belonged to Henderson. \r\nAll the individuals in the house were arrested and charged with trafficking in cocaine.Â  However, Henderson and Covert were also charged with possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.Â  Donald Myers and Roger Harris, both charged with trafficking, pled guilty to simple possession and were to receive suspended sentences in exchange for testifying for the State.Â  \r\nAt trial, Myers testified he purchased cocaine from Henderson and Covert at the house numerous times.Â Â  Myers stated his purchases usually amounted to between one hundred and two hundred dollars each for between one and three-quarters grams and three and one-half grams of cocaine.Â  Myers also testified he had seen both Henderson and Covert bagging cocaine.Â  On September 26, Myers was at the house to purchase cocaine from Covert.Â  Harris also testified he had purchased cocaine from Henderson and Covert at their house at least twice a week for the previous two years.Â  Harris stated Henderson sometimes delivered cocaine to his house.Â  Henderson testified that he never sold drugs to Myers or Harris.Â Â Â  \r\nHenderson was tried together with his co-defendant, Covert, and convicted of both charges.Â  Henderson was sentenced to concurrent sentences of 25 years for the trafficking charge and 10 years for the distribution charge.Â  Henderson now appeals.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n I.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Suppression of Evidence  \r\nHenderson contends the trial judge erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence and by applying a good faith exception to the statutory warrant requirement because the warrant was defective.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nIn criminal cases, an appellate court reviews errors of law only and is bound by factual findings of the trial court unless clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  â€œA courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of legal error that results in prejudice to the defendant.â€Â  State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 377, 580 S.E.2d 785, 793 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\nDuring the trial, Henderson and Covert moved to suppress evidence seized during the search on the basis that although the search was conducted on September 26, 2002, the magistrateâ€™s signature is dated September 28, 2002 on the warrant itself.Â  The magistrateâ€™s signature and the date of September 26, 2002 only appear on two separate pages of the affidavit.Â  During the trial, Detective Timothy Conroy testified that he did not see the magistrate sign the search warrant on the 26th and that â€œmost probably she didnâ€™t sign that night and that was brought back to her on some other occasion to sign.â€Â  Upon finding the warrant was defective under section 17-13-140 of the South Carolina Code (2003), the trial judge ruled a good faith exception to the Fourth Amendmentâ€™s exclusionary rule should apply to South Carolinaâ€™s statutory warrant requirement and denied the motion to suppress all evidence obtained during the September 26 search.\r\nFirst, we must determine whether the warrant was defective because the signature was dated two days after the search was conducted.Â  Section 17-13-140 of the South Carolina Code (2003) states that a warrant shall be â€œissued only upon affidavit sworn to before the magistrate, municipal judicial officer, or judge of a court of record establishing the grounds for the warrant.â€Â  Though the statute does not specifically require that the warrant be signed, it requires that it be â€œissued.â€Â  In Davis v. Sanders, 40 S.C. 507, 19 S.E. 138 (1894), â€œ[our supreme] court held that the warrant was not â€˜issuedâ€™ as required by law, and conferred no authority on the sheriff to make the arrest, because the magistrate did not sign at the foot as he intended to do, and because he did not intend the indorsement on the back as his signature of the warrant.â€Â  Du Bose v. Du Bose, 90 S.C. 87, 90, 72 S.E. 645, 646 (1911).Â  Therefore, a warrant is not issued until signed by an appropriate magistrate, municipal judicial officer, or judge of a court of record.Â  See 77-370 S.C. Op. Attâ€™y Gen. 295 (1977) (stating a warrant is properly issued only when signed by the magistrate and only upon a sworn affidavit).Â  Thus, the warrant in this case was defective because there was no evidence that the magistrate signed the warrant before the search was conducted and the signature on the warrant is dated two days after the search was conducted.\r\nCourts of other states have also held a search warrant must be signed because it is the confirmation that the magistrate determined the facts asserted in the affidavit support a finding of probable cause.[2]Â  In State v. Surowiecki, 440 A.2d 798, 799 (Conn. 1981), the Connecticut Supreme Court held that a warrant is not â€œissuedâ€ without a lawful signature on the search warrant by the person authorized to issue it.Â  The court reached this conclusion even though there was no doubt the judge intended to sign the search warrant and failed to do so because of a â€œmere oversight.â€Â  Id. at 798.Â  There are also several public policy considerations to support a requirement that the warrant be signed prior to a search: it impresses upon the magistrate the importance of his action in issuing a warrant; it discourages police misconduct by dictating that officers can not reasonably rely on an unsigned document as an authorization for conducting a search and by requiring officers to take corrective measures before they conduct a search; and it provides needed protections and assurances to persons in control of the property to be searched that the search has been authorized.Â  State v. Hentkowski, 397 N.W.2d 255, 258 (Mich. Ct. App. 1986).Â  Â Â \r\nHaving found the warrant was defective because the signature was dated two days after the search was conducted; we must next determine whether the good faith exception to the Fourth Amendmentâ€™s exclusionary rule should apply to South Carolinaâ€™s statutory warrant requirement.Â  The trial judge allowed the introduction of the evidence seized pursuant to a good faith exception as adopted by the United States Supreme Court in United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984).Â  The Leon rule applies when a search warrant is defective on Fourth Amendment grounds.Â  Id.Â  However, in this case, the evidence Henderson sought to have excluded was obtained because of a defective search warrant based on a state statutory violation, not a constitutional violation.Â  \r\nIn South Carolina, the statutory warrant requirement is separate and distinct from the prohibition in the federal and state constitutions against unreasonable searches and seizures.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-140 (2003); see U.S. Const. amend. IV; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 10.Â  In fact, as the South Carolina Supreme Court has recognized, section 17-13-140 of the South Carolina Code actually imposes stricter warrant requirements than the constitutional provisions.Â  See State v. Jones, 342 S.C. 121, 128, 536 S.E.2d 675, 678 (2000).Â  Therefore, the Leon good faith exception is not applicable to this case and we must determine whether there is a good faith exception to the statutory warrant requirement in South Carolina.\r\nIn State v. Sachs, 264 S.C. 541, 559, 216 S.E.2d 501, 510 (1975), the Supreme Court of South Carolina found a good faith exception permits the introduction of evidence seized pursuant to a warrant that is defective under section 17-13-140 of the South Carolina Code if the officers have made a good faith attempt to comply with the affidavit requirement.Â  In Sachs, the affidavit the officers relied on contained misstated facts; however, the court determined that such misstatements in an affidavit were â€œnecessary hazardsâ€ encountered when federal and state authorities search in a joint effort and the affidavit satisfied a good-faith attempt to comply with the statute relating to search warrants.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn State v. McKnight, 291 S.C. 110, 112-13, 352 S.E.2d 471, 472 (1987), the officers orally recited the facts upon which the warrant was based, but no affidavit was ever executed. Â As a result, the court found that there was no good faith effort to comply with the statute; however, the court declined to decide whether there is a good faith exception for officers who execute a search with objectively reasonable reliance on a warrant that is ultimately found to be invalid.Â  Id. at 114, 352 S.E.2d at 473.Â  The instant case falls somewhere between the cases of McKnight and Sachs.Â  This is not a case of the â€œnecessary hazardsâ€ of obtaining a warrant as in the case of Sachs and it is not a failure to comply with the statutory warrant requirement as in McKnight.Â  Here, the officers failed to notice that either the magistrate did not sign the warrant on September 26 or that the signature on the warrant itself was misdated as September 28, while the search was conducted on September 26, 2002.[3]Â  The officers could have discovered either error by simply looking at the warrant itself; therefore, we find there was no good faith effort to comply with the statute.\r\nSince we find the warrant was defective and the good faith exception to the warrant requirement does not apply in this case, we must finally determine if the admission of the evidence found with the defective warrant constituted harmless error.Â  â€œError is harmless where it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.â€Â  State v. Reeves, 301 S.C. 191, 193-94, 391 S.E.2d 241, 243 (1990).Â  Generally, appellate courts will not set aside convictions due to insubstantial error not affecting the result.Â  State v. Davis, 364 S.C. 364, 409, 613 S.E.2d 760, 784 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  The violation found in this case cannot be seen as harmless error because exclusion of the evidence could have reasonably affected the result of the trial and the issue of the amount of cocaine allegedly possessed by Henderson was a central issue in this case. [4]  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â  Verdict Form \r\nHenderson contends the trial judge erred by creating four separate special verdict forms for the single charge of trafficking because it unfairly emphasized guilt and gave the jury four separate opportunities to convict him of a single charge.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAt the close of the case, the judge drafted a special verdict form for each defendant with interrogatories consisting of a statement followed by a choice of â€œyesâ€ or â€œnoâ€ as to the trafficking charge and the lesser-included charges of possession with intent to distribute and simple possession.Â  Henderson claims the verdict form created a high probability that the jury would feel compelled to convict him because the first question on the verdict form, pertaining to the trafficking statute, was divided into four separate options and provided multiple choices.Â  As the trafficking statute reads, there are four ways that a jury can find a defendant guilty of â€œtrafficking in cocaineâ€: (1) one who sells, manufactures, cultivates, delivers, purchases, or brings into this State ten grams or more of cocaine; (2) one who provides financial assistance or otherwise aids, abets, attempts to bring into this State ten grams or more of cocaine; (3) one who conspires to sell, manufacture, cultivate, deliver, purchase, or brings into this State ten grams or more of cocaine; or (4) one who is knowingly in actual or constructive possession or who knowingly attempts to become in actual or constructive possession of ten grams or more of cocaine in this State.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Section 44-53-370(e)(2) (2002).Â  \r\nThis is a novel question of law in South Carolina; however, we find the law on jury charges to be applicable.Â  In State v. Rabon, 275 S.C. 459, 462, 272 S.E.2d 634, 636 (1980), our Supreme Court stated that â€œ[t]he Constitution of this State requires that the trial judge declare the law, but no particular verbiage is necessary.â€Â  The court further ruled that the judgeâ€™s charge must be considered as a whole to determine if it adequately covered the applicable law under the facts of the case.Â  Id.Â  Although the statute was broken into four parts on the verdict form, the language of the statute remained unchanged for the most part and adequately covered the law.Â  Additionally, â€œ[t]he test for sufficiency of a jury instruction is what a reasonable juror would have understood the charge to mean.Â  State v. Hughey, 339 S.C. 439, 458, 529 S.E.2d 721, 731 (2000).Â  Therefore, even if the judgeâ€™s attempt to provide guidance to the jury by breaking the statute into four parts was in error, when considered as a whole, the verdict question was a correct statement of the law and was not prejudicial to Henderson.Â  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\nANDERSON, J., (dissenting in part and concurring in part in RESULT ONLY):\r\n I adhere to my dissenting and concurring opinion in State v. Covert,Â  Op. No. 4071 (S.C. Ct. App. Filed Jan. 17, 2006). The latter case involved an appeal by the appellantâ€™s co-defendant and raised issues relating to the search warrant and the special verdict forms.Â  I VOTE to reverse.\r\n__________\r\nGOOLSBY, J. (concurring and dissenting):Â  I adhere to the views expressed in my dissenting opinion in State v. Covert, Op. No. 4071 (S.C. Ct. App. Filed Jan. 17, 2006), both as to the issue of the search warrant and as to the issue of the special verdict form.Â  \r\nI would affirm.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Courts in other states have made the same determination:Â  Kelley v. State, 316 So.2d 233 (Ala. Crim. App. 1975); Martin v. State, 344 So.2d 248 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1976); Byrd v. Commonwealth, 261 S.W.2d 437 (Ky. Ct. App. 1953); United States v. Carignan, 286 F.Supp. 284 (Mass. Dist. Ct. 1967); People v. Hentkowski, 397 N.W.2d 255 (Mich. Ct. App. 1986); State v. Fleming, 227 S.W.2d 106 (Mo. Ct. App. 1950); State v. Williams, 565 N.E.2d 563 (Ohio 1991); State v. Cochrane, 173 N.W.2d 495 (S.D. 1970).\r\n[3] The State did not offer any evidence that the magistrate signed the warrant on September 26, 2002, and the magistrate did not testify at trial.Â  \r\n[4]Â  The State argues that Henderson does not have standing to raise the issue of the defective search warrant because he was not living in the house at the time of the search and therefore did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the house.Â  However, in State v. McKnight, our supreme court determined that the issue of standing would have only been relevant if the case had been decided on constitutional grounds.Â  The court held that â€œ[s]ince the trial judgeâ€™s ruling was based on the stricter, statutory grounds, each of the respondents against whom the evidence was offered had standing to object to the validity of the search.â€Â  291 S.C. at 115, 352 S.E.2d at 474.Â  Therefore, because this case was also not decided on constitutional grounds, we find Henderson had standing to object to the validity of the search.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-038","title":"Baldwin v.

Carpenter, Jr. and Karl S. Brehmer, both Â of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Bryan D. Ramey, of Piedmont and John S. Nichols, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Theresa Ann Baldwin, as Personal Representative of the Estate of John Gerald Baldwin (the Estate), filed a wrongful death action against Robert Peoples.Â  The trial court granted a directed verdict to the Estate as to liability, holding Peoplesâ€™ violation of certain statutes was the direct and proximate cause of Baldwinâ€™s death.Â  The jury returned a verdict for the Estate in the amount of $300,000, and the trial court subsequently granted the Estateâ€™s motion for new trial nisi additur of $357,469.31 for a total award of $657,469.31.Â  Peoples appeals various rulings of the trial judge, including the granting of the directed verdict for the plaintiff on the issue of liability.Â  We reverse and remand for a new trial.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAround 3:00 on the afternoon of February 1, 1996, John Gerald Baldwin was driving a tractor-trailer westerly on a stretch of Interstate 20 when he collided with the back of a forty-foot semi-trailer truck loaded with logs and being pulled by Robert Peoples.Â  Shortly before the accident, Peoples had merged onto the interstate from Highway 521 ahead of Baldwin, driving thirty miles an hour on the entrance ramp.Â  He had increased his speed up to forty miles per hour at the time of the impact.Â  Following the collision between the two trucks, Baldwin was found dead in the cab of his truck with logs piercing his neck and stomach.Â  \r\nOn January 29, 1997, Baldwinâ€™s wife, as personal representative of his estate, filed a wrongful death action against Peoples.Â  Peoples answered, denying his negligence and alleging that Baldwinâ€™s own negligence caused or contributed to his death.Â  When the case initially went to trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Peoples, finding Baldwin to be 100% negligent.Â  The Estate appealed the verdict, and this court reversed and remanded the case for a new trial.Â  Baldwin v. Peoples, Op. No. 2000-UP-766 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Dec. 18, 2000).Â  On certiorari, the South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed in result based on an additional ground appearing in the record, finding the trial court allowed improper argument from the defense that Peoples had not been charged by law enforcement with violating any traffic laws, thus indicating he was in no way at fault and thereby inviting the jury to relinquish its role as the ultimate fact finder.Â  Baldwin v. Peoples, Op. No. 2002-MO-062 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Aug. 28, 2002).Â  \r\nAt the second trial, the Estate contended the collision occurred when Peoples, mistakenly thinking Baldwin was driving in the right lane, swerved into the emergency lane, causing the logs on the rear of his truck to cross the center line and into the left lane of traffic.Â  As a result, the Estate asserted, Baldwinâ€™s truck was caught on the logs, and Peoplesâ€™ truck dragged Baldwinâ€™s truck into the emergency lane.Â  To support its theory of the case, the Estate called Donald Phillips as an expert in accident reconstruction.Â  Phillips testified the logs on Peoplesâ€™ truck overhung the trailer by almost twenty feet; eye witness testimony indicated Baldwin did not brake before impact; based on the speed of each vehicle, the collision was the equivalent of an eighteen to twenty-five mile per hour collision; and if Peoples had properly trimmed the logs to the correct length, Baldwin would not have been impaled by the logs and would not have died as a result of the collision.Â  \r\nPeoples testified his truck was going forty miles per hour at the point of the collision, and the minimum speed limit on that stretch of Interstate 20 was forty-five miles per hour.Â  He was not concerned that he would be hit because when he looked back, no vehicles were coming behind him.Â  Peoples stated he was in the right lane the entire time he was on the interstate.Â  Peoples saw Baldwin in his mirror prior to impact, and testified Baldwin was in the right lane as well, about twenty-five feet away.Â  Peoples claimed Baldwin maintained the same speed as he approached him, never slowing down.Â  When he realized Baldwin was about to hit him, Peoples tried to increase his speed but was unable to do so.Â  Peoples denied that his truck ever strayed over into the left lane.Â  \r\nDavid Thomas, the only other witness to the collision, testified he was following Baldwinâ€™s truck in the left lane when he saw a puff of smoke and then some brake lights.Â  At that point, logs began coming over the top of the cab and the trailer.Â  He stated Baldwinâ€™s truck was still in the left lane at the time of the collision, and Thomas could not see Peoplesâ€™ truck until after the collision.Â  Trooper J.W. Dorton investigated the accident, and testified he documented skid marks and radiator fluid from Baldwinâ€™s truck that were all in the right lane.Â  He found no yawl marks to indicate Baldwinâ€™s tires â€œwere going sideways.â€Â  \r\nPeoples contended that Baldwin was in the right lane behind him and inexplicably ran into the back of the log truck.Â  To support his theory, Peoples presented the expert testimony of accident reconstructionist Joseph Jur.Â  Jur testified there was no indication either Peoples or Baldwin moved from the left lane to the right; there was no evidence Peoplesâ€™ load swung out and crossed the line; and there was no steer maneuver that could have been made to the right by Peoples that could have made the logs shift into the left lane.Â  He stated Peoples would have been in Baldwinâ€™s sight distance for twenty-five seconds, Baldwin should have been able to react in one and a half seconds, and it would have taken Baldwin only 4.9 seconds to come to a complete stop, giving Baldwin plenty of time to stop.Â  Jur opined that the collision occurred in the right lane and that Baldwin, for some unknown reason, ran into Peoplesâ€™ truck.Â  He further testified the accident could not have occurred as the Estate contended.Â  \r\nBefore closing arguments, the Estate moved for a directed verdict on liability.Â  The Estate argued, and the trial judge agreed, that Peoples violated two statutory length provisions and a statutory minimum speed provision, and that Peoples was negligent as a matter of law in entering an interstate at thirty miles per hour, knowing the speed limit was sixty-five and it would take him some time to get up to forty-five miles an hour.Â  The Estate asserted that these violations proximately caused the death of Baldwin, and it was irrelevant how the wreck occurred.Â  The trial judge granted the Estateâ€™s motion for directed verdict, held â€œthis will take out the comparative negligence,â€ and ruled Peoples was not allowed to argue proximate cause to the jury.Â  The judge then instructed the jury he had directed a verdict for the Estate and ruled as a matter of law that Peoples was â€œresponsible for the injuries to and the death of Mr. Baldwin.â€Â  The jury returned a verdict of $300,000 for the Estate.Â  Peoples made a motion for a new trial, and the Estate filed a motion for a new trial nisi additur.Â  Thereafter, the trial court granted the new trial nisi additur on damages alone in the amount of $357,469.31 and denied Peoplesâ€™ motion for a new trial.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhen reviewing a ruling on a motion for directed verdict, we must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.â€Â  Hurd v. Williamsburg County, 363 S.C. 421, 426, 611 S.E.2d 488, 491 (2005).Â  â€œIf the evidence as a whole is susceptible of more than one reasonable inference, the trial judge must submit the case to the jury.â€Â  Id.Â  This Court will reverse the trial judgeâ€™s ruling on a directed verdict motion only where there is no evidence to support the ruling or where the ruling is controlled by an error of law.Â  Clark v. South Carolina Depâ€™t Pub. Safety, 362 S.C. 377, 382-83, 608 S.E.2d 573, 576 (2005).Â  â€œIn reviewing a directed verdict, this Court must determine whether a verdict for the party opposing the motion would have been reasonably possible under the facts.â€Â  Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 149, 485 S.E.2d 903, 908 (1997).Â  â€œThe issue must be submitted to a jury whenever there is material evidence tending to establish the issue in the mind of a reasonable juror.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPeoples argues the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict to the Estate with respect to liability because there was ample evidence of Baldwinâ€™s own negligence, thereby creating a jury issue as to proximate cause.Â  We agree. \r\nPeoples presented evidence from which a jury could determine Baldwinâ€™s negligence caused the collision.Â  For instance, Jur testified at length that, in his expert opinion, Baldwin caused the collision by remaining in the right hand lane and driving his truck into the back of Peoplesâ€™ log truck.Â  Jur further testified the Estateâ€™s theory that Peopleâ€™s trailer swung out into the left lane was wrong, that the evidence showed the load did not swing, that Peoplesâ€™ truck would have had to hit the guard rail before the trailer could swing out into the left lane, and he was â€œabsolutely confident that there is no steer maneuver to the right thatÂ  . . . you can make that can get those logs to go in [the left] lane.â€Â  According to Jur, the collision â€œclearly occurred in the right-hand lane, no question about it.â€Â  In Jurâ€™s opinion, Peoplesâ€™ truck had been in Baldwinâ€™s line of sight for twenty-five seconds before the collision occurred, Baldwin could have brought his truck to a complete stop in 4.9 seconds, and Baldwin had plenty of time to stop or move his vehicle to the other lane to avoid the log truck.Â  When asked whether he had formed an opinion as to the cause of the accident, Jur replied â€œcertainly [for] some unknown reason, which I donâ€™t know the answer to, Mr. Baldwin ran into the back of Mr. Peoplesâ€™ truck.â€Â  Viewing the evidence and all inferences in the light most favorable to Peoples, a reasonable juror could determine the collision occurred as a result of Baldwinâ€™s negligence in failing to keep a proper lookout.\r\nThe Estate argues the determination of who caused the collision is irrelevant because the only reasonable inference from the evidence presented at trial is that Baldwin would not have died but for Peoplesâ€™ negligence.Â  In essence, the Estate argues Peoplesâ€™ negligence is the sole proximate cause of Baldwinâ€™s death.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œProximate cause requires proof of (1) causation in fact and (2) legal cause.â€Â  Bramlette v. Charter-Medical-Columbia, 302 S.C. 68, 72, 393 S.E.2d 914, 916 (1990).Â  Causation in fact is proved by establishing the injury would not have occurred â€˜but forâ€™ oneâ€™s negligence.Â  Hurd v. Williamsburg County, 363 S.C. 421, 428, 611 S.E.2d 488, 492 (2005).Â  Legal cause, on the other hand, is proved by establishing foreseeability.Â  Id.Â  An injury is foreseeable if it is the natural and probable consequence of a breach of duty.Â  Id.Â  With respect to legal cause our supreme court has held:\r\n\r\n  [T]he touchstone of proximate cause in South Carolina is foreseeability.Â  Foreseeability of some injury from an act or omission is a prerequisite to its being a proximate cause of the injury for which recovery is sought.Â  The standard by which foreseeability is determined is that of looking to the natural and probable consequences of the complained of act.Â  While it is not necessary that the actor must have contemplated or could have anticipated the particular event which occurred, liability cannot rest on mere possibilities.Â  The actor cannot be charged with that which is unpredictable or that which could not be expected to happen.Â  In determining whether a consequence is one that is natural and probable, the actorâ€™s conduct must be viewed in the light of the attendant circumstances.Â  \r\n\r\nYoung v. Tide Craft, Inc., 270 S.C. 453, 462-63, 242 S.E.2d 671, 675- 76 (1978) (internal citations and punctuation omitted).Â  Proximate cause does not mean the sole cause.Â  Sims v. Hall, 357 S.C. 288, 299, 592 S.E.2d 315, 320 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Oneâ€™s conduct can be a proximate cause if it was at least a direct, concurring cause of the injury.Â  Id.Â  \r\nOrdinarily, the question of proximate cause is one of fact for the jury and the trial judgeâ€™s sole function in the matter is to determine whether particular conclusions are the only reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the evidence.Â  Hurd, 363 S.C. at 427-28, 611 S.E.2d at 492.Â  â€œA partyâ€™s negligence is the proximate cause only when, without the negligence, the injury could have been avoided or would not have happened.â€Â  Hamilton v. R &amp; L Transfer, Inc., 361 S.C. 286, 290, 604 S.E.2d 397, 398 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  It is generally for the jury to determine whether the defendantâ€™s negligence was a concurring proximate cause of the plaintiffâ€™s injuries, and only when the evidence is susceptible of just one inference does proximate cause become a matter of law for the court.Â  Id.Â  â€œOnly in rare or exceptional cases may the issue of proximate cause be decided as a matter of law.â€Â  Bailey v. Segars, 346 S.C. 359, 367, 550 S.E.2d 910, 914 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œIf there is a fair difference of opinion regarding whose act proximately caused the injury, then the question of proximate cause must be submitted to the jury.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œUnder South Carolinaâ€™s doctrine of comparative negligence, a plaintiff may only recover damages if his own negligence is not greater than that of the defendant.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œOrdinarily, comparing the plaintiffâ€™s negligence with the defendantâ€™s is a question of fact for the jury to decide.â€Â  Id.\r\nUnder the doctrine of comparative negligence, a plaintiff in a negligence action may recover damages if his negligence is not greater than that of the defendant.Â  Weaver v. Lentz, 348 S.C. 672, 684, 561 S.E.2d 360, 367 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  In such a case, the amount of the plaintiffâ€™s recovery is reduced in proportion to the amount of his negligence.Â  Id.Â  â€œGenerally, under a less than or equal to comparative negligence rule, determination of respective degrees of negligence attributable to the plaintiff and the defendant presents a question of fact for the jury, at least where conflicting inferences may be drawn.â€Â  Trivelas v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 357 S.C. 545, 549-50, 593 S.E.2d 504, 506 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nThere is evidence in the record before us that Baldwin failed to keep a proper look out, negligently running into the back of Peopleâ€™s truck, that his injury would not have occurred â€œbut forâ€ this negligence, and that his injury was foreseeable in that it was a natural and probable consequence of his negligence.Â  Considering all the facts and circumstances of this case, a reasonable jury could conclude Baldwinâ€™s conduct was at least a direct, concurring cause of his injury and therefore was a contributing proximate cause of his death.Â  At a minimum, the evidence created a jury issue as to comparative negligence of the two parties.Â  Because the evidence is susceptible of more than one reasonable inference, the grant of the Estateâ€™s motion for directed verdict on liability was error.Â Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause we hold the trial court erred in directing a verdict in favor of the Estate on the issue of liability, we find it unnecessary to address the remaining issues on appeal.Â  For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-039","title":"Fennell v.

McKay, II, both of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Amy and Thomas Fennell appeal the trial courtâ€™s refusal to give a â€œsubsequent treating physicianâ€ charge following a jury verdict for the defendants in this medical malpractice action.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\n In the summer of 1998, Amy Fennell began seeing Dr. Lilly Filler, an obstetrician and gynecologist, during Mrs. Fennellâ€™s first pregnancy.Â  On February 9, 1999, Dr. Filler induced delivery, and Mrs. Fennell gave birth to a healthy girl.Â  A few minutes after the birth, the placenta and other portions of afterbirth were delivered.Â  At that point, Mrs. Fennell began to hemorrhage.Â  Dr. Filler concluded Mrs. Fennellâ€™s bleeding was caused by a weak or tired uterus, also called uterine atony.Â  Mrs. Fennell was discharged from the hospital three days later.Â  \r\nAfter returning home from the hospital, Mrs. Fennell began to experience excessive bleeding and pain in the abdominal area.Â  In April, Dr. Filler performed an ultrasound and saw pieces of afterbirth or â€œretained products of conceptionâ€ attached to Mrs. Fennellâ€™s uterus.Â  The next day, Dr. Filler performed a procedure known as a D&amp;C to remove the retained products of conception.Â  Dr. Filler removed two pieces of retained products of conception, each about the size of a personâ€™s palm, that were described as â€œcalcifiedâ€ and â€œinfected.â€Â  \r\nApproximately two months after the D&amp;C, Dr. Donald Fylstra, a gynecologist at the Medical University of South Carolina, examined Mrs. Fennell and found no measurable endometrium in her uterus.[1]Â  Dr. Fylstra and Dr. Robert Kaufmann, a fertility specialist, administered hormones to Mrs. Fennell in an attempt to regrow her endometrial lining.Â  Some of Mrs. Fennellâ€™s endometrium returned, and there is a dispute as to whether it was enough to allow her to become pregnant again.Â  Dr. Fylstra and Dr. Kaufmann advised Mrs. Fennell that there was little chance she would become pregnant again and explained that a hysterectomy could relieve the pain she was experiencing.Â  Mrs. Fennell made the decision to undergo the procedure.Â  \r\nIn their medical malpractice action against Dr. Filler and Women Physicians Associates OB/GYN P.A., the Fennells claimed Dr. Filler breached the applicable standard of care in negligently failing to remove the products of conception from Mrs. Fennellâ€™s uterus after the birth. The Fennells claimed this failure was the proximate cause of the necessity for the D&amp;C procedure and resulting damage to Mrs. Fennellâ€™s endometrium.Â  \r\nA dispute also arose during the trial as to whether Mrs. Fennell had a functioning uterus at the time of her hysterectomy and whether enough had been done to medically justify the hysterectomy.Â  Dr. Fillerâ€™s expert, Dr. Mark Salley, testified to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Mrs. Fennell could have become pregnant again had she not been given a hysterectomy.Â  \r\nBecause of this dispute, during trial the Fennells requested a â€œsubsequent treating physicianâ€ charge be given that would include the following language: \r\n\r\n  If an injured person uses ordinary care in selecting a subsequent physician for treatment of his or her injury, the law regards any aggravation of the original injury resulting from the negligent act of the subsequent physician as a part of the immediate and direct damages which naturally flow from the original injury.Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial court declined to include the requested charge in its jury instructions.Â  The trial court indicated its general charge on proximate cause and foreseeability was sufficient to instruct the jury on the principle of law contained in the requested charge.Â  No specific objection was raised to the general charge on proximate cause and foreseeability or the charges concerning damages as given by the trial court. Â \r\nThe jury returned a verdict for Dr. Filler and her medical practice.Â  The Fennells were granted ten days to file post-trial motions.Â  The Fennells then filed a motion for a new trial that was subsequently denied.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhen instructing the jury, the trial court is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina.â€Â  Cohens v. Atkins, 333 S.C. 345, 349, 509 S.E.2d 286, 289 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  The substance of the law is what must be instructed to the jury, not any particular verbiage. . . .Â  A jury charge that is substantially correct and covers the law does not require reversal.Â  Burroughs v. Worsham, 352 S.C. 382, 392, 574 S.E.2d 215, 220 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  When reviewing a jury charge for alleged error, the appellate court must consider the charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.Â  Daves v. Cleary, 355 S.C. 216, 224, 584 S.E.2d 423, 427 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œTo warrant reversal for refusal to give a requested instruction, the refusal must have not only been erroneous, but prejudicial as well.â€Â  Cohens, 333 S.C. at 349, 509 S.E.2d at 289 (quoting McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. 301, 306, 457 S.E.2d 603, 606 (1995)).Â  Furthermore, it is not error to refuse a request to charge when the substance of the request is included in the general instructions.Â  Brown v. Stewart, 348 S.C. 33, 53, 557 S.E.2d 676, 686 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Fennells contend the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury with a â€œsubsequent treating physicianâ€ charge.Â  We disagree. \r\nAs a threshold matter, Dr. Filler contends this issue has not been preserved for appeal because the Fennells failed to move for a new trial on the basis of the requested jury instruction.Â  Instead the Fennellsâ€™ motion for a new trial was limited to relief under the thirteenth juror doctrine and the renewal of a mistrial motion made after Dr. Filler and the Fennellsâ€™ expert witness, Dr. March, rendered medical assistance to a juror in the courtroom.Â  Neither of the grounds raised in the motion for a new trial have been pursued on appeal.Â  \r\nHowever, post-trial motions are not necessary to preserve issues that have been ruled upon at trial; they are used to preserve those that have been raised to the trial court, but not ruled upon.Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 77, 497 S.E.2d 731, 734 (1998); see also Hubbard v. Rowe, 192 S.C. 12, 19, 5 S.E.2d 187, 189 (1939) (finding that in matters of appeal, so far as it appears, all that is required is that the questions presented for decision must first have been fairly and properly raised in the trial court and passed upon by that court).Â  Furthermore, when a party requests a jury charge and after an opportunity for discussion the trial court declines to give the charge, it is unnecessary, in order to preserve the point on appeal, to renew the request or object to the failure to give the charge at the conclusion of the jury instructions.Â  Keaton v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 334 S.C. 488, 494, 514 S.E.2d 570, 573 (1999) (citing State v. Johnson, 333 S.C. 62, 64 n.1, 508 S.E.2d 29, 30 n.1 (1998)); Nedrow v. Pruitt, 336 S.C. 668, 677, 521 S.E.2d 755, 760 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  In the instant case, a full discussion was held concerning the requested charge.Â  Each party was allowed to make arguments concerning the addition of the charge, and the trial court ruled on its use.Â  In addition, the Fennells reargued the issue after the jury had been charged, though the record is incomplete in this regard.Â  \r\nEven though this issue is preserved for appeal, it fails on its merits.Â  The Fennells contend the failure to give the requested instruction was harmful because the jury did not know Dr. Filler could be liable for the harm inflicted by the subsequent treating physicians.Â  Several cases have concluded that the inclusion of an instruction such as the one requested is proper.Â  See Howard v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 316 S.C. 445, 450-51, 450 S.E.2d 582, 585 (1994) (concluding that the trial judge properly gave instruction because damages by a subsequent treating physician would have â€œarisen fromâ€ accident as defined in PIP policy); Graham v. Whitaker, 282 S.C. 393, 399, 321 S.E.2d 40, 44 (1984) (finding that the trial judge properly submitted the issue of proximate cause to the jury where plaintiff fell in her physicianâ€™s office and was damaged by the negligence of a subsequent treating physician during a surgical procedure); Payton v. Kearse, 319 S.C. 188, 211, 460 S.E.2d 220, 233-34 (Ct. App. 1995), revâ€™d on other grounds, 329 S.C. 51, 495 S.E.2d 205 (1998) (determining that the trial judge properly submitted the issue of damages caused by a subsequent treating physician to the jury).Â  However, none of these cases require such a charge.\r\nThe trial court in the instant case properly instructed the jury on the issue of proximate cause.Â  Instead of charging the Fennellsâ€™ Request No. 1, the trial court stated that the same goal would be accomplished by charging proximate cause and foreseeability.Â  The trial court interspersed throughout its jury charge the following: \r\n\r\n  If by the lack of the required skill a physician fails to properly treat her patient so that the patient is injured or the condition is made worse than it would have been otherwise, then the physician will be liable for any injury proximately caused to the patient. . . . \r\n  Forseeability of some injury from a negligent act or omission is a requisite to itâ€™s [sic] being a proximate cause of the injury for which recovery is sought.Â  The standard by which forseeability is determined is by looking to the natural and probable consequences of the complained act.\r\n  The defendant may be held liable for anything that appears to have been a natural and probable consequence of the defendantâ€™s negligence.\r\n  Actual damages include compensation for all injuries which are naturally the proximate result of the alleged wrongful conduct of the defendant.\r\n\r\nConsidering the charge as a whole, these jury instructions clearly indicate that all injuries foreseeably flowing from any negligent acts of Dr. Filler are to be attributed to her.Â  The instruction as given embodies the same legal theory as that found in the requested instruction even though it may be somewhat less specific.Â  \r\nEven assuming that the refusal to give the requested charge was error, it was not prejudicial.Â  Because the jury returned a general verdict for Dr. Filler with no damages, the only conclusion to be drawn is that the jury found Dr. Filler had not been negligent.[2]Â  To reverse a case for a failure to include a jury instruction pertaining solely to damages when no negligence was found would be improper.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nSTILWELL, KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Functional endometrium is necessary to accept, nourish, and grow a fertilized egg into a baby.Â  \r\n[2] The Fennells contended at oral argument that they only sought damages for Mrs. Fennellâ€™s loss of childbearing capacity.Â  Consequently, they argue, the jury could have awarded a defense verdict because it did not understand that Dr. Filler could be held liable for those particular damages.Â  The record reveals, however, that Mrs. Fennellâ€™s physical pain, resulting from the retained products of conception and the D&amp;C procedure, was also a possible element of damages.Â  Under these circumstances, it appears that a defense verdict was necessarily premised on a finding of no negligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-040","title":"State v.

Floyd, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-043\r\nSubmitted December 1, 2005 â€“ Filed January 18, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nSenior Assistant Appellate Defender Wanda H. Carter, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott\r\nAssistant Attorney General David A. Spencer, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Robert M. Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Willie Lee Hagood appeals his conviction for second-degree criminal sexual conduct, arguing the trial court abused its discretion in admitting portions of the victimâ€™s medical records into evidence.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nHagood was arrested and indicted for second-degree criminal sexual conduct.Â  The indictment alleged Hagood sexually assaulted a twenty-year-old male.Â  At trial, Hagood argued the sex was consensual.Â  The State maintained Hagood raped the victim and presented expert testimony to discredit Hagoodâ€™s version of the events.Â  \r\nAt trial, the State sought to introduce pictures of the victimâ€™s anus to corroborate the testimony of the medical examiner, to show the severity of the victimâ€™s injuries, and to contradict Hagoodâ€™s claim of consensual sex.Â  The trial court admitted the pictures, finding their probative value outweighed any prejudicial effect.Â  At the close of the evidence, the jury found Hagood guilty and sentenced him to sixteen years.Â  Hagood appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHagood argues the trial court abused its discretion in admitting portions of the victimâ€™s medical records into evidence.Â  However, the State alleges Hagood did not preserve this issue for appellate review because he did not procure a final ruling on the record.Â  We hold the issue was properly preserved, but we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence.\r\nUnless an objection is made at the time the evidence is offered and a final ruling made, the issue is not preserved for review.Â  State v. Shumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 507, 435 S.E.2d 859, 862 (2003).Â  However, where the motion is ruled on immediately prior to the introduction of the evidence in question, no further objection is necessary.Â  State v. Tufts, 355 S.C. 493, 497, 585 S.E.2d 523, 525 (Ct. App. 2003); State v. Mueller, 319 S.C. 266, 268-69, 460 S.E.2d 409, 410-11 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  \r\nHere, it is clear that the trial courtâ€™sÂ  decision, reached after in camera testimony and lengthy arguments with counsel, was a final ruling.Â  Moreover, immediately after the trial court ruled, the State called the medical examiner to the stand, and elicited testimony in front of the jury.Â  Because there was no opportunity for the trial court to change itâ€™s ruling, we find that Hagoodâ€™s in camera objections preserved the issue for appellate review.Â  Therefore, we now turn to the merits of Hagoodâ€™s appeal.\r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 557, 564 S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002).Â  The trial courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of legal error that results in prejudice to the defendant.Â  State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 377, 580 S.E.2d 785, 793 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Evidence should be excluded when its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect.Â  State v. Kelley, 319 S.C. 173, 460 S.E.2d 368 (1995).Â  â€œA trial judge has considerable latitude in ruling on the admissibility of evidence and his rulings will not be disturbed absent a showing of probable prejudice.â€Â  Kelley, 319 S.C. at 173, 460 S.E.2d at 370).Â  The determination of relevancy and materiality of a photograph is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge. Â Kelley, 319 S.C. at 173, 460 S.E.2d at 370.Â  â€œPhotographs calculated to arouse the sympathy or prejudice of the jury should be excluded if they are irrelevant or not necessary to substantiate material facts or conditions.â€ Â State v. Middleton, 288 S.C. 21, 339 S.E.2d 692 (1986).\r\nWe find no abuse of discretion in the trial courtâ€™s admission of the picture of the victimâ€™s anus into evidence.Â  Hagood claimed the intercourse was consensual, and that he and the victim had consensual anal sex on five separate occasions in the month prior to the assault.Â  The Stateâ€™s expert medical examiner testified the condition of the victimâ€™s anus was inconsistent with a person who would have had consensual anal intercourse five times in a month.Â  The picture helped illustrate the examinerâ€™s testimony and was probative in helping the jury understand how the medical testimony rebutted the claims of Hagood.Â  \r\nHagood also alleges the pictures were unnecessary as the testimony adequately conveyed the severity of the victimâ€™s injuries.Â  We disagree.Â  The photographs supported the testimony of the medical examiner and were relevant to the nature of the crime.Â  The State used the photographs to establish that sex was not consensual as alleged by Hagood. These photographs merely corroborated the testimony of the medical examiner concerning how the injuries sustained by the victim were inconsistent with consensual sex.Â  We agree with the trial courtâ€™s finding that the photographs were neither prejudicial nor inflammatory.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the aforementioned reasons, the conviction is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HUFF and BEATTY, J.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral arguments pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-044","title":"Amerson v.

Moose, all of Florence, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Kenneth Amerson, personal representative of Sallie Louise A. Newsomeâ€™s estate, contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on his claims for constructive trust and civil conspiracy as well as on his claim to set aside deeds against John H. Newsome, Sr. and John H. Newsome, Jr.Â  In addition, Amerson appeals the dismissal with prejudice of his claims against the remaining defendants for a constructive trust and to set aside the deeds.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn September 1, 1998, Harley Newsome (Harley) died testate.Â  Harley was survived by his wife Sallie Newsome (Sallie).Â  Harleyâ€™s will named Sallie as his sole beneficiary and the executrix of his estate. However, Sallie was suffering from Alzheimerâ€™s disease and was placed in a nursing home immediately following Harleyâ€™s death.Â  Gena Phillips Ervin, an attorney, was appointed personal representative of the estate.Â  Christine Tolson, Harleyâ€™s sister, was appointed as conservator for Sallie.Â  Cely Baker Reynolds, also an attorney, was appointed as attorney and guardian ad litem for Sallie.Â  \r\nOn January 12, 1999, Ervin filed a petition for the sale of three parcels of real property to John H. Newsome, Sr. and John H. Newsome, Jr. (the Newsomes) and Tolson.Â  The petition stated Sallie was in a nursing home, and she would need the proceeds from the sale to provide for her continuing welfare and needs.Â  The petition was supported by an appraisal by Everett Johnson Realty valuing the property as farmland for a value of $88,800.Â  Sallie, through Tolson and Reynolds, was served with notice of the petition and filed answers making no objections to the sale of the property.Â  On January 14, 1999, the Honorable Marvin I. Lawson issued an order for the sale of real property (the January 14, 1999 Order) stating â€œit is in the best interests of the Estate of Harley and Sallie Newsome to sell the real property.â€Â  \r\nOn March 8, 1999, Sallie died without a will, leaving one sister, nieces, and nephews as her intestate heirs.Â  Kenneth L. Amerson, the spouse of one of Sallieâ€™s nieces, was appointed as personal representative of Sallieâ€™s estate.Â  Upon learning of the previous sale of the property, Amerson had the property reappraised by Robert Christopher who valued the property as commercial land for a value of $263,200.Â  On September 30, 1999, Amerson filed a Rule 60(b) motion seeking to set aside the January 14, 1999 Order on the grounds the final judgment of the probate court was based on mistake and misrepresentation.Â  The Newsomes then filed a motion to intervene, which was subsequently granted.Â Â  \r\nOn August 16, 2000, a hearing was held, and Judge Lawson entered an order (the October 4, 2000 Order) denying the Rule 60(b) motion on the ground that no mistake or misrepresentation existed which would warrant setting aside the January 14, 1999 Order. Amerson appealed this order to the circuit court stating the following grounds:Â  \r\n\r\n1.Â  The probate court committed an error of law in failing to recognize and rule on the alleged conflict of interest and breach of the duty of loyalty from the estate and devised to Sallie for less than fair market value. \r\n2.Â  The probate court committed an error of law in failing to consider whether the interests of Sallie were properly represented in the sale of the properties. \r\n3.Â  The probate court committed an error of law in ignoring an established misrepresentation concerning fair market value of the properties. \r\n4.Â  The probate court committed an error of fact in concluding the properties were not undervalued. \r\n5.Â  The probate court committed an error of law and fact in concluding the sale of the properties was in the best interests of Sallie.Â  \r\n\r\nOn August 20, 2001 the Honorable Ernest Kinard entered an order (the August 20, 2001 Order), affirming the probate courtâ€™s order.Â  This court subsequently affirmed the circuit courtâ€™s order. In the Matter of the Estate of Newsome v. Amerson,Â Â  Op. No. 2003-UP-475 (S.C. Ct. App. filed July 30, 2003).Â  \r\nAmerson commenced this action on April 22, 2002 against the various defendants.Â  The causes of action alleged against the Newsomes included constructive trust, civil conspiracy, and an equitable action to set aside the deeds.Â  The Newsomes filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, or in the alternative for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56, SCRCP.Â  \r\nThe trial court granted summary judgment to the Newsomes as to all causes of action.Â  Further, it dismissed with prejudice the causes of action for constructive trust and to set aside deeds as to all defendants.Â  Amersonâ€™s first three causes of action against the other defendants were unaffected by the order.Â  The trial court gave numerous reasons for its conclusion, including the following:Â  the case is barred due to a previous Rule 60(b) motion which was denied; barred as Amerson cannot establish the elements of an independent action; barred as a collateral attack of the probate order; barred by the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel; barred as extrinsic fraud cannot be alleged; and finally, barred as untimely.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, appellate courts apply the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP, which states that summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Helms Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 340, 611 S.E.2d 485, 488 (2005).Â  On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.Â  Willis v. Wu, 362 S.C. 146, 150-51, 607 S.E.2d 63, 65 (2004); see also Schmidt v. Courtney, 357 S.C. 310, 317, 592 S.E.2d 326, 330 (Ct. App. 2003) (stating all ambiguities,\r\nconclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed most strongly against the moving party).\r\nAdditionally, under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, a defendant may make a motion to dismiss based upon the plaintiffâ€™s failure to state a claim constituting a cause of action. Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 527, 511 S.E.2d 69, 73 (1999).Â  The trial judge may dismiss the claim if the defendant demonstrates the plaintiff has failed â€œto state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of actionâ€ in the pleadings filed with the court.Â  Williams v. Condon, 347 S.C. 227, 232-33, 553 S.E.2d 496, 499 (Ct. App. 2001) (quoting Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP).Â  When considering the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the trial court must base its ruling solely upon the allegations made on the face of the complaint.Â  Baird, at 527, 511 S.E.2d at 73; Stiles v. Onorato, 318 S.C. 297, 300, 457 S.E.2d 601, 602-03 (1995).Â  If inferences drawn from the facts alleged on the complaint would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory, then the\r\ngrant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is improper.Â  Brown v. Leverette, 291 S.C. 364, 366, 353 S.E.2d 697, 698 (1987); McCormick v. England, 328 S.C. 627, 632-33, 494 S.E.2d 431, 433 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  The facts and inferences alleged in the complaint are viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.Â  Toussaint v. Ham, 292 S.C. 415, 416, 357 S.E.2d 8, 9 (1987); Cowart v. Poore, 337 S.C. 359, 364, 523 S.E.2d 182, 184-85 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Grant of Summary Judgment and Dismissal with Prejudice  \r\nAmerson contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the Newsomes and in dismissing with prejudice the causes of action for constructive trust and to set aside deeds as to all defendants.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nÂ â€œThe doctrine of res adjudicata (or res judicata) in the strict sense of that time-honored Latin phrase had its origin in the principle that it is in the public interest that there should be an end of litigation and that no one should be twice sued for the same cause of action.â€ First Natâ€™l Bank v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 207 S.C. 15, 24, 35 S.E.2d 47, 56\r\n(1945). Under this doctrine, a final judgment on the merits in a prior action will conclude the parties and their privies in a second action based on the same claim as to the issues actually litigated and as to issues that might have been litigated in the first action. Sub-Zero Freezer Co. v. R.J. Clarkson Co., 308 S.C. 188, 190-91, 417 S.E.2d 569, 571 (1992); Foran v. USAA Cas. Ins. Co., 311 S.C. 189, 190-91, 427 S.E.2d 918, 919 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\nThe doctrine provides that an existing final judgment rendered upon the merits, without fraud or collusion, by a court of competent jurisdiction, is conclusive of the rights, questions, and facts in issue as to the parties and their privies.Â  Griggs v. Griggs, 214 S.C. 177, 185, 51 S.E.2d 622, 627-28 (1949).Â  If the rights asserted in the second action existed at the time when the judgment was entered in the first action, res judicata will operate as a bar to the second action.Â  Plum Creek Dev. Co. v. City of Conway, 334 S.C. 30, 34, 512 S.E.2d 106, 109 (1999).Â  \r\nFurthermore, res judicata bars subsequent actions by the same parties when the claims arise out of the same transaction or occurrence that was the subject of a prior action between these parties.Â  Id. at 34, 512 S.E.2d at 109; Rogers v. Kunja Knitting Mills, U.S.A., 336 S.C. 533, 537, 520 S.E.2d 815, 817 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Res judicata prevents a litigant â€œfrom raising any issues which were adjudicated in the former suit and any issues which might have been raised in the former suit.â€ Hilton Head Ctr. of South Carolina, Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n of South Carolina, 294 S.C. 9, 11, 362 S.E.2d 176, 177 (1987). â€œRes judicata is the branch of the law that defines the effect a valid judgment may have on subsequent litigation between the same parties and their privies.Â  Res judicata\r\nends litigation, promotes judicial economy and avoids the harassment of relitigation of the same issues.â€ James F. Flanagan, South Carolina Civil Procedure 642 (2d ed. 1996).\r\nTo establish res judicata, the defendant must prove three elements: (1) identity of the parties; (2) identity of the subject matter; and (3) adjudication of the issue in the former suit. Sealy v. Dodge, 289 S.C. 543, 545, 347 S.E.2d 504, 505 (1986); Rogers, 336 S.C. at 537, 520 S.E.2d at 817; Owenby v. Owens Corning Fiberglas, 313 S.C. 181, 183, 437 S.E.2d 130, 131 (Ct. App. 1993); see also Nunnery v. Brantley Constr. Co., 289 S.C. 205, 209, 345 S.E.2d 740, 742-43 (Ct. App. 1986) (stating the following elements must be shown in order to establish the plea of res judicata: (1) The parties must be the same or their privies; (2) the subject matter must be the same; and (3) while generally the precise point must be ruled upon, yet where the parties are the same or are in privity the judgment is an absolute bar not only of what was decided but of what might have been decided). Even when the defendant meets all of the required elements, res judicata\r\nwill not be applied â€œwhere it will contravene other important public policies; the courts must weigh the competing public policies.â€ Johns v. Johns, 309 S.C. 199, 203, 420 S.E.2d 856, 859 (Ct. App. 1992).Â \r\nAdditionally, â€œ[f]or a judgment to bar the maintenance of a subsequent action, there must be identity of the cause of action as well as\r\nidentity of the subject matter.â€ Nunnery, at 209, 345 S.E.2d at 743. If it is doubtful whether a second action is for the same cause of action as the first, the test generally applied is to consider the identity of facts essential to their maintenance, or whether the same evidence would sustain both. Griggs, at 185, 51 S.E.2d at 627-28 (1949). When applying the principle of res judicata, a fundamental test used for comparing causes of action is to determine whether the primary right and duty and the wrong are the same in each action. Nunnery, at 209, 345 S.E.2d at 743.\r\nThe instant action comes on the heels of a previous Rule 60(b), SCRCP motion in the probate court to set aside the sale of real property on the grounds of mistake or misrepresentation.Â  The probate court denied Amersonâ€™s motion, the circuit court affirmed, and this court later affirmed.Â  In the Matter of the Estate of Newsome v. Amerson,Â Â  Op. No. 2003-UP-475 (S.C. Ct. App. filed July 30, 2003).Â  In that initial appeal, Amerson contended the probate court erred in denying his Rule 60(b) motion because the sale price was so far below the fair market value that it shocked the conscience, and Amerson also argued that breaches of fiduciary duty by Tolson, Ervin, and Reynolds required invalidation of the sale.Â  Amerson now seeks to circumvent the previous rulings with this action. \r\nIn this case, the identities of the parties are the same as in the first action, the subject matter is the same, the factual and legal issues are the same, the alleged bases for the plaintiffâ€™s claims as to the Newsomes are the same, and there was a prior adjudication of the same issues by a court of competent jurisdiction.Â  Amerson is barred from pursuing any clams for civil conspiracy as to the Newsomes and any claims for constructive trust and to set aside the deeds as to all defendants because the claims were previously litigated or could have been litigated in his original Rule 60(b) motion.[2]Â  These claims are barred by res judicata, and the grant of summary judgment and order of dismissal with prejudice should be affirmed.[3]Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nII. Civil Conspiracy Claim \r\nAmerson contends the trial judge erred in granting summary judgment to the Newsomes for the civil conspiracy claim, while allowing him to proceed on the claim against all other defendants.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nA civil conspiracy is a combination of two or more persons joining for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff and causing special damage to the plaintiff. Yaeger v. Murphy, 291 S.C. 485, 487, 354 S.E.2d 393, 394 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  The October 4, 2000 Order denying the Rule 60(b) motion conclusively determined there was no plan or conspiracy on the part of Tolson and the Newsomes to purchase the property below market value. The probate court acknowledged that the gravamen of Amersonâ€™s complaint was a plan or conspiracy on the part of Tolson and the Newsomes to purchase the property at below market value.Â Â  The probate court went on to state the reasons why such a notion was unsubstantiated and ends with the statement that â€œI find that there exists in this matter no mistake or misrepresentationâ€ that would warrant setting aside the order for the sale of the property.Â  \r\nFor the reasons applicable to the causes of action for constructive trust and to set aside deeds, i.e. res judicata, Amersonâ€™s civil conspiracy cause of action as to the Newsomes must be dismissed.Â  Amerson asserts the same facts and acts in support of the civil conspiracy and other causes of action against the Newsomes.Â  Though it is unclear why the trial court maintained the civil conspiracy cause of action for the other defendants, the grant of summary judgment to the Newsomes does not preclude Amerson from pursuing the claim against the other defendants.Â  There is no genuine issue of material fact, and the Newsomes are entitled to summary judgment.[4]Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased upon the foregoing, the trial courtâ€™s order is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF and BEATTY, JJ. concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] This conclusion is only bolstered by Amersonâ€™s admission in his brief that the previous appeal, had it been reversed, would have made this case moot.Â  \r\n[3] Although the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel do not bar a collateral attack of a judgment based on extrinsic fraud, we note that only intrinsic fraud is alleged in this case. Â Evans v. Gunter, 294 S.C. 525, 529, 366 S.E.2d 44, 46 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  Extrinsic fraud is collateral or external to the trial of the matter, while intrinsic fraud goes to the merits of the proceeding.Â  In this case, Amerson alleges a conspiracy between the other parties to defraud Sallie and her heirs.Â  This goes to the heart of the property matter and was fully presented and considered in the previous Rule 60(b) motion.Â  Furthermore, because the alleged actions were based on intrinsic fraud, they are barred because they were filed after January 15, 2000, and Rule 60(b) provides that actions for relief from an order based upon mistake, fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party must be filed not more than one year after the order was entered. Rule 60(b), SCRCP.\r\n[4] Because we find the doctrine of res judicata supports the trial courtâ€™s decision to grant summary judgment in favor of the Newsomes, we need not address Amersonâ€™s arguments pertaining to the trial courtâ€™s alternative reasons in support of summary judgment.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (explaining that the appellate court need not address remaining issues when disposition of prior issues is dispositive).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-045","title":"State v.

Widener and Richard J. Morgan, both of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Tammy Rowe appeals the trial courtâ€™s order of dismissal.Â  We dismiss the appeal as untimely.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn March 2003, Tammy Rowe sued her former employer, Advance America, Cash Advance Center, for wrongful retention of wages, negligent supervision, breach of employment contract, and civil conspiracy.Â  In addition, she filed suit for slander, false imprisonment, emotional distress, assault and battery, and civil conspiracy against her former co-worker, Loletta Grant.Â  Advance America and Grant (Respondents) filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  On July 15, 2003, following a hearing, the trial court granted Respondentsâ€™ motion to dismiss as follows:\r\n\r\n  Upon hearing arguments by Counsel and review of the Complaint it appears to the Court that the Complaint needs to be redrafted.Â  Therefore - Motion to Dismiss is granted without prejudice and Plaintiff may file an Amended Summons and Complaint within thirty (30) days.Â  And IT IS SO ORDERED.\r\n\r\nOn August 26, 2003, Rowe filed an amended complaint.Â  Respondents again filed a motion to dismiss.Â  The trial court dismissed the amended complaint with prejudice for Roweâ€™s failure to abide by the thirty day deadline set in the July 15, 2003 order.Â  \r\nOn October 20, 2003, Rowe filed a motion entitled â€œPlaintiffâ€™s Motion for Reconsideration,â€ setting forth numerous grounds for â€œrelief from Judgment or Order under Rule 60â€ or â€œsetting aside the Order.â€Â  The court denied the motion.Â  Rowe appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n Roweâ€™s appeal to this court is not timely and must therefore be dismissed.[2]Â  When a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion for reconsideration is made, â€œ[t]he time for appeal for all parties shall be stayed . . . and shall run from the receipt of written notice of entry of the order granting or denying such motions.â€Â  Rule 59(e), SCRCP. Â A motion made under Rule 60, SCRCP, however, does not toll the running of the time for appeal.Â  Otten v. Otten, 287 S.C. 166, 167, 337 S.E.2d 207, 208 (1985).Â     \r\n\r\n  We find Roweâ€™s motion was a Rule 60 motion to set aside the order rather than a Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration.Â  It is a well-recognized legal concept in South Carolina that motions should be treated based on substance and effect as opposed to how they are styled by the moving party.Â  See Mickle v. Blackmon, 255 S.C. 136, 140, 177 S.E.2d 548, 549 (1970).Â  The court must examine the relief sought to understand the true nature of the pleading.Â  See Standard Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n v. Mungo, 306 S.C. 22, 26, 410 S.E.2d 18, 20 (Ct. App. 1991) (stating it is the substance of the relief sought that matters â€œregardless of the form in which the request for relief was framedâ€).\r\nAlthough Roweâ€™s motion was captioned â€œPlaintiffâ€™s Motion for Reconsideration,â€ the motion indicates that it is being made under Rule 60 rather than Rule 59.Â  The substance of the motion is the contention that the trial court erred in granting the previous motion to dismiss without a hearing.Â  The prayer for relief seeks to have the order set aside.Â  If the trial court had granted the relief sought, it would not have merely altered or amended the previous order, but would have set it aside in its entirety.Â  It would then have been appropriate to hold a hearing on the merits of the motion that resulted in the order dismissing the amended complaint.Â  Consequently, we conclude that the motion was in sum and substance a Rule 60 motion. \r\nBecause we find the motion was made under Rule 60, we hold Roweâ€™s appeal to this court is not timely. Â The notice of appeal in a civil action must be served on all respondents within thirty days following receipt of written notice of entry of the order or judgment.Â  Rule 203(b)(1), SCACR.Â  The requirement of service of the notice of appeal is jurisdictional.Â  Elam v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 14-15, 602 S.E.2d 772, 775&nbsp;(2004).Â  â€œ[I]f a party misses the deadline, the appellate court lacks jurisdiction to consider the appeal and has no authority or discretion to â€˜rescueâ€™ the delinquent party by extending or ignoring the deadline for service of the notice.â€Â  Id.Â  Rowe filed the motion in October of 2003.Â  She therefore had written notice of the dismissal order on or before that date.Â  She did not serve her notice of appeal to this court until November of 2004.Â  The appeal is therefore untimely under the South Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause Roweâ€™s appeal is untimely, it is hereby\r\nDISMISSED.\r\n STILWELL, KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â Â Â Â  \r\n[2] Â Because we find Roweâ€™s appeal untimely, we do not address the merits of the appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-048","title":"Rodriguez v.

Gregory, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-048\r\nSubmitted December 1, 2005 â€“ Filed January 20, 2006Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nDISMISSED IN PART and AFFIRMED IN PART\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Terry Wayne Yarbrough, of Beaufort; for Appellants.\r\n        John K. Blincow, Jr. and R. Gerald Chambers, of Charleston; Mary Bass Lohr and James S. Gibson, of Beaufort; for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This appeal stems from injuries James M. Rodriguez alleges to have suffered after Dr. Eugene A. Eline performed surgery on Rodriguezâ€™s back at Beaufort Memorial Hospital.Â Â  Rodriguez and his wife appeal the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Hospital.Â  Rodriguez also appeals the trial courtâ€™s grant of a directed verdict in favor of Dr. Eline on Rodriguezâ€™s causes of action for lack of informed consent and battery.Â  Finally, the Rodriguezes appeal the trial courtâ€™s denial of their motions for judgment not withstanding the verdict and new trial.Â  We dismiss in part and affirm in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nJames Rodriguez first injured his back in January of 1996 when he lifted a chain-link fence while working as a driver for Coastal Mental Health.Â  He was diagnosed with a herniated disk, and Dr. Rhodin, who had treated Rodriguezâ€™s wife for many years, provided treatment.Â  Rodriguezâ€™s pain gradually improved, but in December of 1997, he re-injured his back while lifting a sink.Â  The pain from the injury was severe, and Dr. Rhodin referred Rodriguez to Dr. Eline, a board certified orthopedic surgeon.Â  \r\nAt the recommendation of Dr. Eline, Rodriguez underwent surgery on April 2, 1998. Initially, Rodriguezâ€™s condition seemed to improve, but in June, Rodriguez stood up suddenly and experienced a severe shooting pain in his left leg.Â  He reported this pain to Dr. Eline, who ordered an MRI.Â  After reviewing the results, Dr. Eline recommended fusing a section of Rodriguezâ€™s spine to prevent further disk problems and to promote stability.Â  Rodriguez admits Dr. Eline told him of the risks and benefits of surgery before the procedure was performed.\r\nRodriguez underwent this fusion surgery on September 24, 1998. To perform the fusion, Dr. Eline removed the disk that was degenerated and replaced it with a BAK cage.[1]Â  The BAK cage was a fairly new device, and just a few months earlier, Dr. Eline had trained to use the device.Â  However, the surgical procedure of performing an instrumental fusion was a routine part of Dr. Elineâ€™s practice, and Rodriguezâ€™s own expert, Dr. Dunn, testified that all cage devices are similar.Â  \r\nDuring the surgery, a sales representative from Spinetech, the company that produces BAK cages, was present.Â  According to the Hospitalâ€™s policies, if a sales representative is in the operating room, the patient must be informed of the sales representativeâ€™s presence and the purpose of that presence.Â  Prior to surgery, Rodriguez signed a consent form authorizing Dr. Eline to perform the surgery with the help of â€œsuch assistants as may be selected by him;â€ however, Dr. Eline never specifically told Rodriguez a sales representative would be present.Â  \r\nAfter the surgery, Dr. Eline continued to treat Rodriguez until January 1999.Â  Rodriguez was still experiencing pain, however, and he sought a second opinion from Dr. Donald R. Johnson of the Carolina Spine Institute.Â  Dr. Johnson discovered the cage Dr. Eline had inserted was impinging on a nerve.Â  Dr. Johnson performed another surgery on Rodriguez, this time removing the cage and replacing it with screws.Â  Dr. Johnson opined that the damage to Rodriguezâ€™s nerve was not entirely repairable and found Rodriguez had a fifty percent impairment rating and was no longer employable.Â  \r\nRodriguez and his wife commenced a medical malpractice action against Dr. Eline and LowCountry Bone &amp; Joint Surgery, LLC on June 18, 2001.[2]Â  This complaint was amended numerous times.Â  Pursuant to these amendments, LowCountry Medical Group, LLC (the surgical group with which Dr. Eline was employed) and Beaufort Memorial Hospital were added as defendants.Â  The third amended complaint was served on the Hospital on January 3, 2002, asserting causes of action for medical malpractice, negligent supervision, and loss of consortium.Â  In late February 2002, the Hospital moved for summary judgment, arguing the two-year statute of limitations of the South Carolina Tort Claims Act barred the Rodriguezes from asserting a cause of action against it.Â  \r\nIn July of 2002, the Rodriguezes moved to amend their third amended complaint to assert an additional cause of action against the Hospital, alleging Rodriguezâ€™s rights under the Patientsâ€™ Bill of Rights were violated by the presence of the surgical salesperson in the operating room during Rodriguezâ€™s surgery.Â  In February of 2003, the trial court granted the Hospitalâ€™s motion for summary judgment, and therefore did not address the Rodriguezesâ€™ motion to amend.Â  \r\nThe Rodriguezes immediately appealed the grant of summary judgment, and Dr. Eline moved to stay the action against him pending the appeal.Â  As a result, the Rodriguezes withdrew their appeal, and the case was remitted to the circuit court on May 1, 2003. Â \r\nThe Rodriguezesâ€™ action against Dr. Eline[3] went to trial on November 10, 2003.Â  The trial court directed a verdict in favor of Dr. Eline on the Rodriguezesâ€™ request for punitive damages as well as on their causes of action for lack of informed consent, battery, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract. After hearing all of the evidence, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Dr. Eline.Â  The Rodriguezes filed a â€œMotion for JNOV and/or New Trial,â€ arguing the jury verdict was based on passion, prejudice, or caprice.Â  The Rodriguezes further argued a new trial was warranted because the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict on their causes of action for lack of informed consent and medical battery.Â  The trial court denied the motion, and this appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Nexsen v. Haddock, 353 S.C. 74, 77, 576 S.E.2d 183, 185 (Ct. App. 2002). Summary judgment is appropriate when it is clear that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the evidence and the inferences which can be drawn therefrom should be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001). \r\nWhen ruling on directed verdict or JNOV motions, the trial court must view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Sabb v. S.C. State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).Â  â€œIf the evidence as a whole is susceptible to more than one reasonable inference, a jury issue is created and the motion should have been denied.â€Â  Quesinberry v. Rouppasong, 331 S.C. 589, 594, 503 S.E.2d 717, 720 (1998).Â  â€œHowever, this rule does not authorize submission of speculative, theoretical, and hypothetical views to the jury.â€Â  Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 150, 485 S.E.2d 903, 908 (1997).Â Â Â  In essence, the court must determine whether a verdict for the opposing party â€œwould be reasonably possible under the facts as liberally construed in his favor.â€Â  Harvey v. Strickland, 350 S.C. 303, 309, 566 S.E.2d 529, 532 (2002). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Summary Judgment\r\n\r\nThe Rodriguezes first argue the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the Hospital.Â  Specifically, they argue the two-year statute of limitations did not begin to run on their causes of action for lack of informed consent and violation of the Patientsâ€™ Bill of Rights until November of 2000, when they received discovery from the Hospital informing them a sales representative was in the operating room.Â Â  The Hospital argues the appeal from the trial courtâ€™s order of summary judgment is untimely because the Rodriguezes did not file their appeal until more than a year after the ruling.Â  We agree.\r\nIn Olson v. Faculty House of Carolina, Inc., 344 S.C. 194, 544 S.E.2d 38 (Ct. App. 2001) affirmed in result by 354 S.C. 161, 580 S.E.2d 440 (2003), our court addressed a similar situation and found the appeal was untimely.[4]Â  In Olson, the plaintiff was injured in November of 1995 while visiting a dining club on the University of South Carolinaâ€™s campus.Â  She filed an action against the dining club in March of 1997, and when she later discovered the club was owned by the University, she added the University as a defendant in January of 1998.Â  The University moved for summary judgment, arguing Olsonâ€™s claim was barred by the two-year statute of limitations set forth in South Carolina Tort Claims Act.Â  The trial court granted the motion, and Olson did not immediately appeal this ruling.Â  Instead, Olson pursued her actions against the dining club.Â  The dining club then moved for summary judgment, and the trial court granted it as to one of Olsonâ€™s causes of action.Â  Olson appealed this ruling as well as the earlier ruling granting summary judgment to the University.Â  Id. at 200, 544 S.E.2d at 41.\r\nThe University argued Olsonâ€™s appeal was untimely because she waited more than a year after the ruling before deciding to appeal.Â  Our court agreed, explaining:\r\n\r\n  The order [granting summary judgment to the University] ruled that all of Olsonâ€™s claims against the University were barred by the statute of limitations.Â  This ruling therefore adjudicated all of the claims as to the University.Â  [The dining club] did not assert the statute of limitations as a defense.Â  Olsonâ€™s claims against [the dining club] were thus separate and dis[tinct] from her claim against the University.Â  The fact Olson had continuing claims against [the dining club] was irrelevant to the dismissal of the University.Â  Nothing short of direct appeal could resurrect the action against the University.\r\n\r\nId. at 214, 544 S.E.2d at 48 (emphasis in original).\r\nHere, as in Olson, the trial court found that all of the claims against the Hospital were barred by the statute of limitations.Â  Thus, the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to the Hospital was a final order because it left nothing further for determination.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2004) (explaining which orders are appealable).Â  Because the order was final as to the University, the Rodriguezes were required to serve the appeal within thirty days after receiving the written order granting summary judgment.[5]Â  Initially, the Rodriguezes met this deadline; however, they withdrew their appeal, and the case was remitted to the circuit court.Â Â  Because this new appeal was filed more than a year after the order granting summary judgment, our court is without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â  Directed Verdict \r\nRodriguez next argues the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict on his claim for lack of informed consent and battery.Â  We disagree.\r\nOur court outlined the elements of informed consent in Hook v. Rothstein, 281 S.C. 541, 547, 316 S.E.2d 690, 695 (Ct. App. 1984):\r\n\r\n  Under the doctrine of informed consent, it is generally held that a physician who performs a . . . surgical procedure has a duty to disclose to a patient of sound mind, I the absence of an emergency that warrants immediate medical treatment, (1) the diagnosis, (2) the general nature of the contemplated procedure, (3) the material risks involved in the procedure, (4) the probability of success associated with the procedure, (5) the prognosis if the procedure is not carried out, and (6) the existence of any alternatives to the procedure.\r\n\r\nThe Hook court went on to â€œreject the lay standard and [held] that the scope of a physicianâ€™s duty to disclose is measured by those communications a reasonable medical practitioner in the same branch of medicine would make under the same or similar circumstances.â€Â  Id. at 553, 316 S.E.2d at 698.Â  Expert medical evidence is ordinarily required to establish this standard.Â  Id.Â  \r\nDuring trial, Rodriguez presented testimony from numerous experts, most of whom testified regarding damages.Â  Two experts, Dr. Robert Dunn and Dr. Francis Dyro, testified regarding the standard of care a surgeon should employ when performing back surgery, but neither testified that Dr. Eline deviated from the standard of care regarding informed consent.Â  Although Dr. Dunn stated it was unacceptable to violate Hospital policies, when asked directly if a violation of Hospital policy was a violation of the generally accepted standard of practice, Dr. Dunn stated, â€œWell, I mean a hospital wonâ€™t let you operate in a hospital that you donâ€™t have privileges in.Â  I mean â€“ â€¦ if they do, it a violation of their own policy.â€Â  This testimony fell far short of the â€œstandard of careâ€ expert testimony required by Hook.\r\nRodriguez argues Hookâ€™s requirement for expert testimony only applies when there are questions regarding â€œmaterial risks of the procedure and medical judgment not in the realm of the average man.â€Â  Rodriguez claims his case falls outside of Hook because it involves issues which are in the average manâ€™s realm, such as â€œ(1) risks of the surgery due to the surgeonâ€™s inexperience; (2) the patientâ€™s right to be informed, as dictated by the Board of Directors of [the Hospital]; and (3) the deliberate violation of [H]ospital policy in order to conceal Dr. Elineâ€™s inexperience.â€ Although Rodriguez cites many cases, none of them lend support to his argument that Hook should be so limited, and we therefore decline to distinguish this case from the precedent established in Hook.\r\nRodriguez further argues that even if Hook applies, the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict because one of Dr. Elineâ€™s experts testified at his deposition that the violation of hospital policy was a deviation from the generally accepted practice.Â  However, Dr. Elineâ€™s case was not before the trial court when it granted the directed verdict, and it would therefore be improper for our court to consider the testimony.Â  See Weir v. Citicorp Natâ€™l Servs., Inc., 312 S.C. 511, 514-15, 435 S.E.2d 864, 864 (1993) (explaining that the appellate court applies the same standard a trial court uses when considering a directed verdict motion).\r\nWe therefore find no error in the trial courtâ€™s grant of Dr. Elineâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on Rodriguezâ€™s cause of action for lack of informed consent.Â  Furthermore, because Rodriguezâ€™s cause of action for battery is premised on a lack of informed consent, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision to grant a directed verdict on that cause of action as well.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIII. JNOV and New Trial Motions\r\nFinally, the Rodriguezes argue the trial court erred in failing to grant their JNOV and new trial motions because the trial court did not allow them to cross-examine two of Dr. Elineâ€™s experts about their relationship with the South Carolina Joint Underwriting Association (JUA).Â  However, the Rodriguezes failed to argue this ground in their JNOV and new trial motions.Â  Thus, it is not preserved for review.Â  Likewise, the Rodriguezesâ€™ argument that their motions for JNOV and new trial should have been granted because the testimony from Dr. Elineâ€™s experts was cumulative and prejudicial was not raised in their motions to the trial court.Â  Therefore, it too is not preserved for our review.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we decline to address the Rodriguezesâ€™ appeal against the Hospital because it was not served within thirty days of the trial courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment.Â  We affirm the trial courtâ€™s grant of a directed verdict in favor of Dr. Eline on Rodriguezâ€™s causes of action for lack of informed consent and battery.Â  Finally, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s denial of the Rodriguezesâ€™ JNOV and new trial motions.\r\nDISMISSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur. Â \r\n\r\n[1] A BAK cage is a small cylinder that is implanted into the hole where a diskectomy is done in order to get the bones to fuse.Â  \r\n[2] LowCountry Bone &amp; Joint Surgery was ultimately dismissed.Â  After Dr. Eline presented his case, both parties stipulated that he was employed by Lowcountry Medical Group, not LowCountry Bone &amp; Joint Surgery. \r\n[3] As explained before, the Rodriguezes also sued two medical entities they claimed Dr. Eline was affiliated with.Â  For clarityâ€™s sake, Dr. Elineâ€™s name is used to refer to both him and his surgical group.\r\n[4] The supreme courtâ€™s opinion in Olson does not address the timeliness of Olsonâ€™s appeal against the University. \r\n[5] The Rodriguezes argue they were not required to appeal the grant of summary judgment until the claims against all the defendants were resolved and cite to Link v. School Dist. of Pickens County, 302 S.C. 1, 393 S.E.2d 176 (1990) for this proposition.Â  However, the Link court found an appellant who had multiple claims against one defendant could wait to appeal the grant of summary judgment as to one of those claims until a final judgment disposing of all claims was entered.Â  Id. at 5-6, 393 S.E.2d at 178-79. The Link case did not involve multiple defendants, and therefore, is not controlling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-049","title":"Rhine v.

Young, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-049\r\nHeard October 5, 2005 â€“ Filed January 20, 2006Â Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Thomas R. Goldstein, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\n        Richard C. Burke, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Linda Rhine appeals the trial courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment in favor of the Shady Lady.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAt 2:00 pm on January 24, 2001, Robin Swem went to a bar called The Shady Lady.Â  While there Swem consumed between four and seven liquor drinks, some of which were purchased by her friend, Kim Livingston who worked as a bartender at the Shady Lady.Â  Swem left the Shady Lady between 4:00 and 5:00 pm and went home.Â  Swem drank at least two liquor drinks at her apartment and returned to the Shady Lady around 7:00 pm to meet Livingston to go out.Â  When Swem ordered a drink, the bartender refused to serve her because of her visibly intoxicated condition.Â  \r\nAfter being refused service, Swem decided she needed to go home, so she called her father and asked him to pick her up.Â  Swem argued with her father, and he refused to drive her home.Â  Although a friend offered to drive her home, Swem did not want to wait, so she left the Shady Lady in her own automobile around 8:30 pm.Â  A few minutes later, Swem collided with the rear of Linda Rhineâ€™s vehicle, which was stopped at a traffic light.Â  Swem was arrested at the scene and charged with driving under the influence, a charge to which she later pleaded guilty.Â  \r\nOn July 31, 2002, Rhine brought this lawsuit alleging negligence against Swem and the Shady Lady.Â  Swem settled with Rhine, leaving the Shady Lady as the sole defendant.Â  The Shady Lady filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing there was no evidence any employee of the Shady Lady served alcohol to Swem while she was in a visibly intoxicated condition, and the chain of causation was broken when Swem consumed alcohol for several hours away from the premises of the Shady Lady. Â After hearing arguments on the motion and reviewing the affidavits of Swem and Teressa Armstrong, a witness to the collision, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Shady Lady.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhen reviewing the grant of summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP.â€Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 494, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002). â€œSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 529, 511 S.E.2d 69, 74 (1999).Â  â€œIn determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€Â  Summer v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 42, 492 S.E.2d 55, 58 (1997).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nRhine argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the Shady Lady.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nRhine first contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the procedural basis that she failed to reference the statute that prohibit the service of alcohol to an intoxicated person in her pleadings.Â  However, the trial court did not rely on Rhineâ€™s failure to plead the statute as a basis for granting summary judgment.Â  The trial court merely noted that Rhine pled a common law cause of action against the Shady Lady for negligence in serving alcohol to Swem while she was intoxicated and that liability for such actions arises only by statute in South Carolina.Â  Tobias v. Sports Club, Inc.&nbsp; 332 S.C. 90, 92, 504 S.E.2d 318, 319 (1998).Â  The trial court stated â€œthe failure to plead the statutory violation as the basis for dram shop liability against the Shady Lady may, in and of itself, warrant dismissal and/or summary judgment.â€Â  (emphasis added) Â The trial court did not grant summary judgment in favor of the Shady Lady because of a pleading error, but went on the discuss the merits of Rhineâ€™s negligence claim, including the Shady Ladyâ€™s liability under the statute.Â  \r\nThe trial court found the Shady Lady was not liable, as a matter of law, for Swemâ€™s actions because Rhine produced no evidence the Shady Lady served alcohol to Swem while she was in a visibly intoxicated condition.Â  We find no error in the trial courtâ€™s decision.Â Â  \r\nAt common law, a tavern owner could not be held civilly liable for injuries caused by an over-served, intoxicated patron.Â  Lydia v. Horton, 355 S.C. 36, 41, 583 S.E.2d 750, 753 (2003).Â  However, South Carolina courts have held that a bar ownerâ€™s violation of the criminal statute forbidding service to intoxicated persons can support a civil suit by a third party against the bar for injuries caused by the intoxicated person.Â  Tobias, 332 S.C. atÂ  92, 504 S.E.2d at 319. Â Therefore, Rhineâ€™s action must be predicated upon a showing the Shady Lady violated section 61-6-2220 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) that prohibits the sale of alcoholic beverages contained in minibottles to intoxicated persons.Â  Id.; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 61-6-2220 (Supp. 2005) (â€œNo person or establishment licensed to sell alcoholic beverages pursuant to this article may sell these beverages to persons in an intoxicated condition;Â  these sales are considered violations of the provisions thereof and subject to the penalties contained herein.â€)\r\nRhine contends that Swemâ€™s testimony she consumed between four and seven liquor drinks during her first visit to the Shady Lady is sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Shady Lady is liable for Rhineâ€™s injuries.Â  Rhine cites our opinion in Daley v. Ward in support of this position.Â  303 S.C. 81, 399 S.E.2d 318 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  There, Daley instituted an action against a bar, Windjammer, for serving alcohol to an intoxicated person, Ward, with whom she was involved in an accident.Â  Id. at 83, 399 S.E.2d at 14.Â  At trial, Daley presented evidence that Ward had left the bar approximately twenty minutes earlier after spending four or five hours there drinking nine, twelve-ounce cans of beer.Â  Id.Â  Both Daley and the investigating officer testified they believed Ward was intoxicated, and an expert witness, who viewed a videotape of Wardâ€™s behavior following the accident, opined that he believed Ward was intoxicated.Â  Id.Â  Based on this evidence, the Daley court concluded the trial court did not err in submitting the case to the jury, stating:Â  â€œThere was more than ample evidence that Ward was intoxicated at the time of the accident and the jury could have easily concluded he was just as intoxicated at the time he was served his last beer at the Windjammer.â€Â  Id. at 85, 399 S.E.2d at 15.Â Â Â  Â Â Â \r\nThe Daley case is clearly distinguishable from the case at bar.Â  Swem visited the Shady Lady on two occasions on the date of the accident.Â  The only evidence Rhine presented that Swem was in an intoxicated condition during her first visit to the Shady Lady was that Swem drank between four and seven alcoholic drinks before she left.Â  Rhine presented no testimony from any employee or patron of the bar indicating that Swem was intoxicated during the first visit, and Swem did not maintain she was intoxicated.Â  After Swem left the Shady Lady, she spent two hours drinking alcohol in her apartment.Â  When Swem returned and ordered a drink, the bartender refused to serve her.Â  \r\nBased upon these facts, we find the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the Shady Lady.Â  The number of drinks Swem consumed, without evidence Swem showed signs of intoxication, is not sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Shady Lady served Swem while she was in an intoxicated condition during her first visit.Â  In regard to the second visit, there is ample evidence to support the conclusion Swem was intoxicated at the scene of the accident and, by inference, when she left the bar, but the Shady Lady cannot be held liable under the statute because an employee recognized Swem was intoxicated and refused her service.Â  Accordingly, the order of the trial court isÂ  \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nGOOLSBY, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ. concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-050","title":"Powell v.

Â Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992). We are not, however, required to disregard the findings of the family court, which saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony. Â Haselden v. Haselden, 347 S.C. 48, 58, 552 S.E.2d 329, 334 (Ct. App. 2001); Wilson v. Walker, 340 S.C. 531, 537, 532 S.E.2d 19, 22 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\nSection 20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code Annotated (Supp. 2005) sets forth factors the family court should consider when equitably dividing a marital estate and vests the family court with discretion to decide what weight to assign each factor. Â Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 100, 545 S.E.2d 531, 537 (Ct. App. 2001). Â â€œThis court will affirm the family court judge if it can be determined that the judge addressed the factors under section 20-7-472 sufficiently for us to conclude he was cognizant of the statutory factors.â€ Id.Â  An award of alimony rests within the sound discretion of family court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. Â Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 282, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002).Â  â€œAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs is a discretionary matter not to be overturned absent abuse by the trial court.â€ Â Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 365, 384 S.E.2d 741, 748 (1989).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWife argues the family court erred in (1) failing to make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law with regard to each of the equitable distribution factors set forth in section 20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code; (2) in failing to award Wife alimony secured by Husbandâ€™s possible inheritance; (3) in failing to take into account Husbandâ€™s dissipation of marital asset by dividing the marital estate equally; (4) in refusing to give appropriate weight to the testimony of Wifeâ€™s accountant regarding Wifeâ€™s foregone opportunities; (5) in finding Husbandâ€™s forty percent interest in the family business was transmuted into marital property and, alternatively, in failing to award Wife a special equity interest in the business; (6) in making findings of fact not supported by the evidence and in declining to find Husband dissipated the marital estate by more then $100,000 during the marriage; (7) in failing to question Husbandâ€™s credibility; (8) in failing to award Wife the full amount of her attorneyâ€™s fees; (9) in failing to assign all of the marital debt to Husband; (10) in failing to adopt Wifeâ€™s valuation of Husbandâ€™s forty percent interest in the family business; (11) in failing to enforce a prior order awarding Wife $750 in attorneyâ€™s fees; (12) in refusing to give adequate consideration to Wifeâ€™s faultlessness in the break up of the marriage; (13) in not including assets dissipated by Husband in the marital estate; and (14) in determing that Wifeâ€™s financial circumstances were better then Husbandâ€™s. Â \r\nAfter a thorough review of the record, the decision of the family court, and the briefs of the parties, we find the family courtâ€™s order provides a detailed statement of the facts and shows the family court judge carefully considered and correctly applied the relevant law in this case.Â  The family courtâ€™s order is hereby affirmed and reprinted as part of the opinion of this court. \r\nTHE ORDER OF THE HONORABLE A. E. â€œGENEâ€ MOREHEAD, III:\r\nThis matter came before me for a final hearing pursuant to a Summons and Complaint filed by the Plaintiff in June, 2002. Both parties were present with their respective attorneys, and the following are the salient facts.\r\nHISTORY\r\nThe Plaintiff/wife and the Defendant/husband were married on November 14, 1981, and have resided in Richland County throughout their marriage. No children were born of the marriage; however, the wife was previously married and had custody of her nine-year-old son when the parties married. The wife was twenty-eight years old and the husband twenty-nine when they married. They separated after nineteen years of marriage in December of 2000 when the wife asked the husband to vacate the marital home. Prior to the partiesâ€™ marriage, the wife worked full time in the pathology lab at Baptist Medical Center but switched to part-time employment once married in order to spend more time at home. The husband, both prior to the marriage and up until the separation, worked in a family owned mobile home rental business. The family, closely held corporation owns a number of mobile homes on property owned by the husbandâ€™s parents. The husband worked side-by-side with his father until his death in August shortly prior to the partiesâ€™ separation. The wife is presently fifty-one years of age, and the husband is fifty-three.\r\nIn June, 2002, approximately a year and a half after the partiesâ€™ separation, the wife filed an action seeking a divorce on one yearâ€™s continuous separation. Additionally, she sought alimony, an equitable distribution of marital assets and debts and attorneyâ€™s fees. The husband was initially represented by James E. Holler and, pursuant to a request by the Plaintiff, Stanley G. Freeman was appointed his Guardian ad Litem. An Answer was filed setting up a basic general denial to the allegations.\r\nThe husband has had a history of medical problems including psychiatric care; and due to his actions both prior and subsequent to their separation, the Plaintiff requested a Guardian ad Litem be appointed. Mr. Holler was subsequently relieved as the husbandâ€™s attorney, and the Guardian ad Litem, a close family friend, agreed to continue as both the husbandâ€™s Guardian ad Litem and attorney, pro bono, with the consent of the wife and her attorney.\r\nAt the call of the case, the Court inquired from both parties as to the possibility of reconciliation and from their responses finds that there is no such possibility.\r\nDIVORCE\r\nThe parties separated in December, 2000, and when the action was instituted in June of 2002, they had lived separate and apart for a year and a half without cohabitation. This is uncontradicted and duly corroborated. The Plaintiff/wife is entitled to a divorce on one yearâ€™s continuous separation without cohabitation.\r\nALIMONY\r\nThe Plaintiff/wife sought alimony and argued that special circumstances existed for the Court to award lump sum alimony. The Defendant/husband does not have the capability of making a lump sum payment; and based on all of the testimony, the Court finds that this is not an appropriate case for an award of alimony. In considering the factors set forth in the alimony statute, the prerequisites are not present to award the wife alimony. She clearly has the capability of supporting herself and financially is in a much greater position than the husband.\r\nFrom 1972 until the parties married in 1981, the wife worked full time at the Baptist Hospital. When the parties married, she switched to part-time employment based on a family decision. That decision made sense at the time. Since the husband was working in the family owned mobile home rental business, she could spend more time at home not only with her new husband but especially her nine-year-old son who remained with them for the next nine years. Contrary to the testimony of her Certified Public Accountant, Mark Hobbs, who indicated she was convinced to work only part-time, the Court finds that this was a family decision based on the circumstances that existed when the parties married. Shortly after the parties separated, not only has the wife continued her part-time employment at the hospital, but she is also receiving the salary that had been traditionally paid to the husband out of the family owned mobile home rental business.\r\nPrior to the partiesâ€™ marriage, the husband worked with his father in the family mobile home rental business. That business was incorporated, and the husband has had an interest in the business since 1975. His father gifted to him forty (40%) percent of the corporate stock, retaining sixty (60%) percent. As the fatherâ€™s health began to deteriorate, he turned more responsibilities over to the husband where eventually he was running the operation. The husband, in the last few years prior to the separation lost interest in the business and got more involved in hobbies and other interests. When his father died in August of 2000, the business was in deplorable condition due to the husbandâ€™s lack of attention.\r\nWhile educated with excellent handyman skills, the husband has basically relied on his family, especially his father, for all of his life. Both prior to and throughout the marriage, he has had numerous medical problems including psychiatric care. During the marriage, he had a lengthy bout with alcoholism requiring inpatient treatment; but he has been sober since January 28, 1988. The wife was there assisting him through this problem. With a family history of psychiatric problems, he has battled these problems throughout the marriage. He has been on most anti-depressants on the market. Presently he should be taking Zoloft but is not, stating that he cannot afford it. Likewise, he has had inpatient care for this problem, most recently after the separation from his wife and the death of his father when his sister took him for treatment. It was obvious that he was not recovering from his depression that began prior to his fatherâ€™s death. He has previously received electric shock treatments for his illness. Since the separation, he has now developed arrhythmia and as recently as this year, has been diagnosed with diabetes.\r\nAs stated above, while educated and good with his hands, throughout his entire life he has depended on his family, especially his father, to meet his needs. The facts bear that out. When the parties married in 1981, the father allowed them to move into a home owned by him, and they have remained there their entire marriage. In 1989, they made improvements to that home when it was not even owned by them. The father loaned them the money for the improvements which they were to pay back over a period of ten years. The father subsequently canceled the last two years of payments. In the early 90s, the father gifted the home to his son. The father brought the son into the family business and eventually gifted to him forty (40%) percent of the corporate stock. The son was able to draw an annual income from the business by keeping the books, working with the renters, handling maintenance, etc. Eventually his income rose to Four Thousand ($4,000.00) Dollars a month or Forty-eight Thousand ($48,000.00) Dollars annually for the years prior to the separation. The Court believes the husband when he testified that his father had always been his safety net and had bailed him out over the years. They worked together, side-by-side, for over fifteen years; and when the husband saw that his fatherâ€™s health was deteriorating, prior to his death in 2000, his depression and psychiatric problems crept back into his life to the point that when his father died in August, the fear and responsibility paralyzed him to the standpoint that he could not function.\r\nHaving battled the husbandâ€™s alcoholic problem in the 80s, the wife attempted to deal with this situation in the late 90s when the husband would be gone for days at a time and would not be there to help with the business when his fatherâ€™s health was declining. She finally reached her limit; and in December of 2000, asked him to leave, which he did. The husbandâ€™s sister, Alice Powell Rosen, who lives in Hampton, Virginia, had been coming to South Carolina frequently prior to her fatherâ€™s death and noticed how the family owned mobile home rental business was deteriorating primarily due to the husbandâ€™s lack of attention. Upon their fatherâ€™s death, his sixty (60%) percent of the corporate stock went to their surviving mother. Those shares are presently in an intervivos revocable trust with Alice Powell Rosen acting as Trustee. She has basically taken over the business, hired a managing firm to get the business back on its feet, and after the year 2000 stopped paying her brother the Four Thousand ($4,000.00) Dollars a month from the business. Since she lives in Virginia, she, in turn, hired the Plaintiff/wife to be her eyes and ears in South Carolina; and beginning in January of 2001, started paying her the Four Thousand ($4,000.00) Dollars a month to act as Treasurer writing checks, doing bookwork, etc. That Forty-eight Thousand ($48,000.00) Dollar salary was paid to the wife for the years 2001 and 2002 in addition to her part-time salary at the hospital bringing her annual income to over Seventy Thousand ($70,000.00) Dollars. In 2003 that monthly salary was reduced from Four Thousand ($4,000.00) Dollars to Three Thousand ($3,000.00) Dollars where she now receives Thirty-six Thousand ($36,000.00) Dollars annually in addition to her part-time employment at the hospital. Since the separation in December of 2000 and without his monthly income from the family business, the Defendant/husband has relied on friends for assistance and, for approximately two years, sold a Cobra kit car and motorcycles for self-preservation in addition to doing odd jobs where he has earned Four Hundred ($400.00) to Five Hundred ($500.00) Dollars a month.\r\nWhile the parties were married nineteen years prior to their separation, the wifeâ€™s earning capability has been and probably always will be higher than the husbandâ€™s. Looking at plaintiffâ€™s Exhibit #27, the Social Security records indicate for the past fourteen years since 1990 she has earned in excess of Twenty Thousand ($20,000.00) Dollars annually working part-time at the hospital. She testified that presently there is a hiring freeze at the Baptist Hospital for full time employment, but with the other medical facilities in the Columbia area, nothing would preclude her from returning to full time employment. At present she does not have to consider that option with the additional income from the family owned mobile home rental business. In the year 2000 when the parties separated, through her part-time employment, she earned in excess of Twenty-nine Thousand ($29,000.00) Dollars. Since the separation and upon receiving the Forty-eight Thousand ($48,000.00) Dollars from the family owned business, she has grossed in excess of Seventy Thousand ($70,000.00) Dollars. Even though it was reduced to Thirty-six Thousand ($36,000.00) Dollars in 2003 and continues at that rate, she is earning Sixty-five ($65,000.00) to Seventy Thousand ($70,000.00) Dollars annually. With these two employments, she has the ability to support herself. Her sister-in-law who is presently the Trustee for sixty (60%) percent of the corporate stock indicates that she will continue Plaintiff/wife in that employment but does not know what will happen when her mother dies. At that time, Plaintiff/wife may be in a position to return full time to a hospital at a salary that will be higher than any annual salary the husband has ever made throughout the marriage.\r\nIn addition to their earning capabilities, their physical and emotional conditions are quite the opposite. The wife is in excellent health and on no medication. The husband has battled several medical conditions. While it is commendable that he has not had a drink since January of 1988, that is an ongoing struggle. There was a period of time when he was addicted to amphetamines, and he has to constantly battle that addiction. His major problems now are psychiatric, depression. He presently does not have the financial capability to seek appropriate medical attention.\r\nThe partiesâ€™ standard of living has not been elaborate with most extras being provided through the generosity of the husbandâ€™s father who died in August of 2000. Their anticipated expenses are normal, and while there is no evidence that the wife has any outside or non-marital properties, the husband could inherit assets from his parentsâ€™ estate and a trust depending on the circumstances that exist at the time of his motherâ€™s death. That property could go as high as Five Hundred Eighty-five Thousand ($585,000.O0) Dollars but could be as little as One Hundred Forty-seven Thousand ($147,000.00) Dollars.\r\nBased on those factors, the wifeâ€™s request for alimony is denied.\r\nEQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION\r\nThe following are the marital assets that are subject to the equitable distribution statute.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Wife&rsquo;s checking, savings and CD\r\n    $20,000\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Wife&rsquo;s hospital retirement\r\n    46,613\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Former marital home (705 Percival Road) &ndash; equity&nbsp;\r\n    0\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Wife&rsquo;s 1999 Yukon\r\n    4,900\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Husband&rsquo;s Ford pickup\r\n    4,400\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Honda Gold Wing\r\n    500\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Furniture and household goods in former marital home\r\n    5,000\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Three pool tables and unsold motorcycles at the time the action  was instituted in June of 2002\r\n    \r\n     5,000\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Cash value of two life insurance policies&nbsp;\r\n    2,066\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TOTAL&nbsp;\r\n    88,479\r\n  \r\n\r\nAn explanation concerning these assets, their respective values, and what is marital and non-marital is necessary. The undisputed evidence shows that the wife had One Thousand Five Hundred ($1,500.00) Dollars in her checking account, approximately Five Thousand Five Hundred ($5,500.00) Dollars in her savings account and Thirteen Thousand ($13,000.00) Dollars in a Certificate of Deposit for a total of Twenty Thousand ($20,000.00) Dollars. The husband had no accounts. While the wifeâ€™s present hospital retirement is in excess of Fifty-six Thousand ($56,000.00) Dollars, Plaintiffâ€™s Exhibit #28 shows that, at a point closest to the institution of this action, Forty-six Thousand Six Hundred Thirteen ($46,613.00) Dollars was in the account.\r\nThe former marital home at 705 Percival Road should be included in the marital estate due to transmutation of this property which was gifted to the husband by his father. At the time the action was instituted, the outstanding equity line was equal to its fair market value; therefore, there was no equity in the property. When the parties married in 1981, the husbandâ€™s father allowed them to move into this property where they remained until they separated in December of 2000. While the property was not owned by them, they doubled the size of the home in 1989 by adding an addition. They borrowed money from the husbandâ€™s father to pay for that addition agreeing to pay him back in monthly installments for the next ten years. Thus the loan would be satisfied in 1999. From joint incomes, they repaid the husbandâ€™s father for eight years. In 1998, again through the fatherâ€™s generosity, he canceled the last two years on the note at Ten Thousand ($10,000.00) Dollars per year for a total of Twenty Thousand ($20,000.00) Dollars.\r\nWhen the Defendantâ€™s father, through assistance of legal counsel, realized that upon his death he would have a taxable estate, he set up various testamentary trusts and began gifting property. Over a period of three years as shown by plaintiffâ€™s Exhibits #2, #3 and #4, he gifted a thirty-three and a third interest in the property to his son in the years 1990, 1991 and 1992 to avoid a gift tax. Upon the fatherâ€™s death, a one-tenth interest was deeded from his estate in 2002. While repairs were done to the property prior to their owning it, from 1990 until 1998 through joint funds, they repaid the husbandâ€™s father for those improvements. Additionally, while the property was received free and clear of any mortgage, the parties in 1992, as shown by Plaintiffâ€™s Exhibit #6, took out an equity line securing it with a mortgage with a maximum credit of Fifty-Six Thousand ($56,000.00) Dollars. Both parties were obligated under the equity line. Over the years, the husband has borrowed money against that equity line and as shown by the accountantâ€™s Exhibit #32 (tab 8) as far back as May of 1997, the equity line was over Fifty-three Thousand ($53,000.00) Dollars. At the time of their separation in December of 2000, it was still over Fifty-three Thousand ($53,000.00) Dollars; and at the time the action was instituted in June of 2002, it was in excess of Fifty-five Thousand ($55,000.00) Dollars. On two occasions, in July of 2000 prior to the separation and in April of 2002 prior to the institution of this action, the outstanding balance exceeded Fifty-Six Thousand ($56,000.00) Dollars which was the maximum credit line. While the tax assessorâ€™s office as shown by Plaintiffâ€™s Exhibit #1 reflects the value of this property at Forty-one Thousand Four Hundred ($41,400.00) Dollars, the Court finds based on the equity line that was issued, realizing that lending institutions normally do not authorize a loan for more than the value of the property, that the fair market value of the former marital home was Fifty-six Thousand ($56,000.00) Dollars with a secured equity line balance at the time the action was instituted of Fifty-six Thousand ($56,000.00) Dollars giving it zero (0) equity. While the property was gifted solely to the husband by his father over three years, the parties have used this as their marital home for the entire nineteen years. After being deeded the property, beginning in 1990, for seven years with joint funds they repaid the father for the additions that were added until he canceled the last two years. From 1992 when the equity line was taken out, all payments on that equity line have been made with marital funds. When the parties separated in December of 2000 and the husband stopped receiving his monthly salary from the family owned business and, in turn, it went to the Plaintiff, she has been the only person to make payments on the equity line. This includes from the time of their separation until the action was instituted in July of 2002 and also up until the time of this hearing. The equity line has now been reduced to Forty-four Thousand Seven Hundred ($44,700.00) Dollars. Under supporting case law, transmutation has occurred to include the former marital home into the marital estate.\r\nThe wifeâ€™s Yukon has a fair market value of Seven Thousand ($7,000.00) Dollars with an outstanding lien of Two Thousand One Hundred ($2,100.00) Dollars giving its present value at Four Thousand Nine Hundred ($4,900.00) Dollars. The husband indicated the only things he had left were a Ford pickup and a Honda Gold Wing motorcycle worth approximately Five Hundred ($500.00) Dollars. The Court finds that the Ford pickup and the Honda Gold Wing equal the fair market value of the wifeâ€™s Yukon and values the pickup at Four Thousand Four Hundred ($4,400.00) Dollars. The wife testified that the personal furnishings in the home were worth approximately Four Thousand ($4,000.00) Dollars while her financial declaration reflects Five Thousand ($5,000.00) Dollars. The Court finds Five Thousand ($5,000.00) Dollars is correct. While the husband testified that he thought they separated in 2001, the Court finds they separated in 2000. He did indicate that he owned several pool tables prior to their separation. It is clear that throughout their marriage the husband would purchase motorcycles, fix them up, resale them; and at the time they separated, owned numerous motorcycles. In addition, he had purchased a Cobra kit car for approximately Twenty-one Thousand ($21,000.00) Dollars. Both the husband and wife testified that he sold that Cobra kit car in the year 2000. He also acknowledged selling some motorcycles in the year 2000 and some in 2001 for self-preservation. He indicated including the Cobra car, which was sold for Eighteen Thousand ($18,000.00) Dollars, he made anywhere from Twenty ($20,000.00) to Twenty-Â­five Thousand ($25,000.00) Dollars during those two years and used those funds to live on since he was receiving no income. The Cobra kit car and most of the motorcycles were sold prior to the institution of this action in June of 2002 and, therefore, were not in existence at the time of the action and would not be included in the marital estate. There is some question as to whether all of the motorcycles were sold prior to the institution of the action, and the Court finds that if any were still available and sold subsequently along with the pool tables, they would constitute a value of about Five Thousand ($5,000.00) Dollars equal to the household furnishings in the former marital home.\r\nThe husband does have two life insurance policies with Jefferson Pilot which were taken out during the marriage. One policy was purchased in 1987 and has a face value of Ninety-five Thousand ($95,000.00) Dollars. A loan of Four Thousand Five Hundred Eighty-two ($4,582.00) Dollars has been placed on that policy with a cash value of One Thousand Two Hundred Twenty-two ($1,222.00) Dollars. The second policy with Jefferson Pilot was purchased in December of 1990 with a face value of One Hundred Thousand ($100,000.00) Dollars. There is an outstanding loan of Nine Thousand Four Hundred Eighty-eight ($9,488.00) Dollars with a current cash value of Eight Hundred Forty-four ($844.00) Dollars, leaving the total cash value at Two Thousand Sixty-six ($2,066.00) Dollars.\r\nSeveral assets are not marital property. It is undisputed that the husband has a forty (40%) percent interest in the stock of the family corporation. That stock has not been transmuted to be included in the marital estate. The wifeâ€™s financial declaration values that stock at One Hundred Thousand ($100,000.00) Dollars, but there is no evidence to justify that evaluation. The husbandâ€™s financial declaration values the stock at Twenty-six Thousand ($26,000.00) Dollars but, likewise, there is no evidence to justify that evaluation. It is undisputed that the husband had been working with his father in this family business and had an interest in the business since 1975. It is also undisputed that his father gifted to him forty (40%) percent of the stock retaining sixty (60%) percent until his death when his stock passed to his widow. The husbandâ€™s stock has remained a separate asset and has not been transmuted. While the income derived by the husband through his employment was placed back into the marriage, the stock itself has never been transmuted into the marital estate and has remained separate. It was not until after the parties separated that the wife became employed with the family owned business, and she has been adequately compensated for her services through that employment. The forty (40%) percent interest in the corporation will remain with the husband. Additionally, it is undisputed that the husband had no checking or savings account. Throughout the marriage when he received his monthly checks from working in the family business, he would turn them over to the wife who paid all of the family bills. The husband used a One Thousand ($1,000.00) Dollars lease check and the equity line to meet his needs and expenses through the marriage. The husband is due to inherit some real estate through his fatherâ€™s estate if he should survive his mother. He has a vested interest in certain property and a contingency interest in others. On pages 7 and 8 of his fatherâ€™s Will as is shown on Plaintiffâ€™s Exhibit #11, he is subject to inheriting approximately six acres on one side of Percival Road if that property is being rented to the family corporation. That property has a value of approximately Four Hundred Thirty-seven Thousand Six Hundred Fifty ($437,650.00) Dollars. Under sub-paragraph (b), he will also inherit property surrounding the former marital residence on the other side of Percival Road with a value of approximately One Hundred Forty-six Thousand Seven Hundred Fifty ($146,750.00) Dollars. Of course, the Court does not know whether he will survive his mother and, likewise, does not know the length and term of the lease or rental agreement to the corporation. None of these assets would be included in the marital estate.\r\nHaving determined that the marital estate has a value of Eighty-eight Thousand Four Hundred Seventy-nine ($88,479.00) Dollars, pursuant to the statute, the Court must determine the partiesâ€™ respective interests. They were married for nineteen years prior to their separation. Both parties contributed both directly and indirectly in obtaining these assets. Throughout the marriage, the wife worked part-time at the hospital providing direct income while the husband worked in the family business providing direct income. Additionally, through the husbandâ€™s family, they received the former marital home which was transmuted into the marital estate and have received numerous gifts through the generosity of the husbandâ€™s father including debt cancellations. Both parties provided indirect contributions with the wife cooking and cleaning and doing gardening and landscaping around the property. Likewise, the husband did landscaping work, added a patio and maintained the grounds. Due to the length of the marriage and their direct and indirect contributions, the Court finds that the marital estate should be divided equally with each party receiving Forty-four Thousand Two Hundred Thirty-nine and 50/100 ($44,239.50) Dollars. The plaintiff/wife shall receive the following.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Her checking, savings and CD\r\n    $20,000\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Her hospital retirement\r\n    46,613\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Former marital home (705 Percival Road) &ndash; equity\r\n    0\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Her 1999 Yukon\r\n    4,900\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Her household goods and personal property&nbsp;\r\n    5,000\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Cash value of the two life insurance policies&nbsp;\r\n    2,066\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    TOTAL&nbsp;\r\n    $78,579\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe Defendant/husband shall receive the following:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    His Ford pickup\r\n     4,400\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Honda Gold Wing&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    500\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Three pool tables and unsold motorcycles at the time  the action was instituted in June of 2002\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    5,000\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    TOTAL\r\n    $9,900\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn order to balance the equal division, the wife will owe the husband Thirty-four Thousand Three Hundred Thirty-nine and 50/100 ($34,339.50) Dollars. That contribution by the wife will be offset by the husbandâ€™s contribution to her legal fees and costs.\r\nThe Court finds it appropriate to give most of the assets to the wife in that presently she is the only one employed having the capability of maintaining those assets including the two life insurance policies. Testimony was that the premiums may become too expensive in future years such as in 2026 on the first policy and 2010 on the second policy. The wife has continued to pay the premiums on these policies, keeping them in effect throughout the separation and this litigation, and is the one most likely to keep the premiums current. The husband had no objection in allowing her to retain those policies, so she can keep them in effect or cash them in as desired. By receiving the former marital home with no equity, the wife will be responsible for the equity line and shall hold the husband harmless.\r\nATTORNEYâ€™S FEES\r\nThe plaintiff sought reimbursement for her legal fees and costs for the necessity of this action. James McLaren testified in support of the legal fees and costs amounting to Fifty-seven Thousand Two Hundred Ninety-eight ($57,298.00) Dollars. Mr. Warner spent approximately one-hundred eight hours on the file at Four Hundred ($400.00) Dollars an hour accounting for fees in excess of Forty-three Thousand ($43,000.00) Dollars. He had clerks involved for thirty-five hours at Seventy-five ($75.00) Dollars an hour and paralegals involved at One Hundred ($100.00) Dollars an hour. His costs and expenses were Six Thousand Two Hundred Ninety-six ($6,296.00) Dollars, the bulk of which was paid initially to the Certified Public Accountant. That accountant testified and put in an exhibit, a lengthy notebook encompassing eleven separate tabs, which the Court reviewed in detail. His testimony was that through the weekend prior to the trial, his outstanding bill was in the neighborhood of Five Thousand Six Hundred ($5,600.00) Dollars to Five Thousand Seven Hundred ($5,700.00) Dollars but for the necessity of testifying it would increase to between Six Thousand ($6,000.00) Dollars and Six Thousand Five Hundred ($6,500.001 Dollars.\r\nIn considering an award of attorneyâ€™s fees, the Court has to look at factors set out in the Glasscock case and other supporting cases. In considering those factors, the Court has to conclude that some of the expenses were excessive and do not fit comfortably into those factors. As an example, some of the spreadsheets submitted by the accountant were of little use to the Court. Tab 11 in his exhibit shows that if the Defendant/husband had saved Seven Thousand Two Hundred ($7,200.00) Dollars per year, he would have had substantial savings when the parties separated. Of course, there was no comparable showing of what the Plaintiff/wife would have had if she had had an annual savings plan. Her plan could have potentially reduced what the CPA contends she will need in the future as set forth under tab 9. There is probably not a married couple in South Carolina who, in 20/20 hind sight, could not look back at savings they would have accumulated during their marriage if they had saved â€œXâ€ amount of dollars. Other considerations are that Mr. Warnerâ€™s hourly rate of Four Hundred ($400.00) Dollars is not the ongoing rate in the area. It is higher than the average. Mr. Warner summed up the case during his cross-examination of the Defendant/husband in that after a nineteen year marriage and this litigation of over two years, the parties have ended up with a house whose equity line is maxed out and a couple of automobiles, and that is the entire marital estate. Submitting a bill for fees and costs in excess of Fifty-seven Thousand ($57,000.00) Dollars is too high for full reimbursement.\r\nHaving found that these fees and expenses cannot be fully reimbursed, had the Plaintiff/wifeâ€™s attorney not pursued discovery vigorously and prepared her case by entering thirty-two separate exhibits, the Court would have had no information whatsoever on which to base its decision because the Defendant/husband provided little or nothing to the Court. He kept contending that due to his medical problems and psychiatric needs, both his long-term and short-term memory have been greatly effected. Taking that factor into prominent consideration, the Court does find that the Defendant/husband should make a substantial monetary contribution toward the legal fees and costs incurred by the Plaintiff/wife and finds that a contribution of Thirty-five Thousand ($35,000.00) Dollars would be fair and equitable. This is in excess of sixty-one (61%) percent of her total fees and costs, and due to the Defendantâ€™s lack of cooperation, that payment is appropriate. Since the Plaintiff/wife was ordered to pay the Defendant/husband Thirty-four Thousand Three Hundred Thirty-nine and 50/100 ($34,339.50) Dollars to balance the equitable distribution and ensure that each party received an equal distribution, that payment will be offset by the Defendant/husbandâ€™s requirement to contribute Thirty-five Thousand ($35,000.00) Dollars toward her legal fees and costs. In turn, the Plaintiff wife will be responsible for paying those fees to her attorney in lieu of and as an offset to the equitable distribution; and the balance of Six Hundred Sixty and 50/100 ($660.50) Dollars will be paid by the Defendant/husband directly to the Plaintiffâ€™s attorney within forty-five days of the date of the order. Accordingly,\r\nIT IS, HEREBY, ORDERED AND DECREED that the Plaintiff is granted a divorce, a vinculo matrimonii, from the Defendant on the ground of having lived separate and apart continuously without cohabitation for over one year.\r\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Plaintiffâ€™s request for alimony is denied.\r\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the parties shall equitably divide the marital estate as discussed hereinabove. Both parties shall execute any documents necessary to carry out the Courtâ€™s decision.\r\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Defendant/husband shall pay the Plaintiffâ€™s attorney Six Hundred Sixty and 50/100 ($660.50) Dollars within forty-five days of the date of this order, and the Plaintiff will be responsible for the balance of her fees which considered the offset in her equitable distribution. \r\nBased upon the aforementioned, the order of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and SHORT, JJ. concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-051","title":"Taylor v.

Markley Dennis, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-051 \r\nSubmitted January 1, 2006 â€“ Filed January 20, 2006Â Â  \r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Frank L. Valenta, Jr., and Kelli Gregg Maddox, of Blythewood, for Appellant.\r\n      Michael Sean Oâ€™Neal, of North Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles (the Department) appeals the trial courtâ€™s order reversing the administrative hearing officerâ€™s order sustaining the suspension of Suchart Taylorâ€™s driverâ€™s license.Â  We reverse.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn September 1, 2004, Officer Hamm of the South Carolina Highway Patrol responded to a report of a vehicle accident on Interstate 26 in Berkley County.Â  When Officer Hamm arrived at the scene of the accident, paramedics were treating Taylor for his injuries.Â  During a break in the treatment, Officer Hamm approached Taylorâ€™s vehicle.Â  As he approached, he smelled an odor of beer emanating from the area around Taylor.Â  Officer Hamm arrested Taylor for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI).Â  Due to the extent of Taylorâ€™s injuries, Taylor was transported to the hospital.Â  \r\nAt the hospital, Officer Hamm determined Taylor could not take a breath test due to the heavy mouth injuries he sustained from the accident.Â  Officer Hamm requested a blood sample from Taylor.Â  Taylor refused to provide a blood sample, and refused to sign the implied consent form.Â  Because Taylor refused to sign the form, Officer Hamm read it out loud, but did not provide Taylor a tangible copy.Â  Thus, Taylor heard his implied consent rights but neither read nor signed the implied consent form.Â  \r\nBecause Taylor refused chemical testing, Officer Hamm issued him a notice of suspension of his driverâ€™s license.Â  Shortly thereafter, Taylor requested a hearing to challenge the suspension of his license.Â  On October 13, 2004, the hearing officer sustained the suspension of Taylorâ€™s license.Â  Taylor then petitioned the trial court to review the administrative hearing officerâ€™s order.Â  The trial court heard Taylorâ€™s petition and reversed the hearing officerâ€™s order.Â  The Department now appeals the trial courtâ€™s order.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for an appeal from an order of an administrative agency.Â  Section 1-23-380(A)(6) of the South Carolina Code (2005) provides: \r\n\r\n  The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  The court may affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings.Â  The court may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions are: \r\n  (a) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions. . . .\r\n\r\nâ€œThe findings of an administrative agency are presumed correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence.â€Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Motor Vehicles v. Nelson, 364 S.C. 514, 519, 613 S.E.2d 544, 547 (2005).Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the administrative agency reached in order to justify its action.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œIn reviewing a final decision of an administrative agency, the circuit court essentially sits as an appellate court to review alleged errors committed by the agency.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Department argues the trial court erred in reversing the order of the administrative hearing officer.Â  We agree.\r\nIn South Carolina, operating a motor vehicle is a privilege of the State, not a right of the individual.Â Â  \r\n\r\n  The license to operate a motor vehicle upon the public highways of this state is not a property right, but is a mere privilege subject to reasonable regulations under the police power in the interest of the public safety and welfare. Â Such privilege is always subject to revocation or suspension for any cause relating to public safety. Â However, the privilege cannot be revoked arbitrarily or capriciously.Â  \r\n\r\nSponar v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Pub. Safety, 361 S.C. 35, 39, 603 S.E.2d 412, 415 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  As part of this privilege, individuals operating motor vehicles implicitly consent to chemical tests of their breath, blood, or urine to determine whether they are driving while under the influence of drugs or alcohol.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950 (Supp. 2004).Â  \r\nThe implied consent laws of this State attempt to balance the interest of the State in maintaining safe highways with the interest of the individual in maintaining personal autonomy free from arbitrary or overbearing State action.Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court articulated this policy in S.C. Depâ€™t of Motor Vehicles v. Nelson, 364 S.C. 514, 521, 613 S.E.2d 544, 548 (2005), when the court stated: \r\n\r\n  The implied consent laws are driven by public policy considerations. Â The State has a strong interest in maintaining safe highways and roads. Â One way to accomplish this goal is to enact laws directed at minimizing drunk driving. Â \r\n\r\nSection 56-5-2950 of the South Carolina Code provides:\r\n\r\n  No tests may be administered or samples obtained unless the person has been informed in writing that:\r\n  (1) he does not have to take the test or give the samples, but that his privilege to drive must be suspended or denied for at least ninety days if he refuses to submit to the tests and that his refusal may be used against him in court; \r\n  (2)Â  his privilege to drive must be suspended for at least thirty days if he takes the tests or gives the samples and has an alcohol concentration of fifteen one-hundredths of one percent or more; \r\n  (3)Â  he has the right to have a qualified person of his own choosing conduct addition independent tests at his expense; \r\n  (4) he has the right to request an administrative hearing within thirty days of the issuance of the notice of suspension; and \r\n  (5)Â  if he does not request an administrative hearing or if his suspension is upheld at the administrative hearing, he must enroll in an Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program. \r\n\r\nThe aforementioned administrative hearing must be held within thirty days after request for the hearing is received.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2951(F) (Supp. 2004).Â  By statute, the â€œscope of the hearing must be limited to whether the person: (1) was lawfully arrested or detained; (2) was advised in writing of the rights enumerated in Section 56-5-2950; [or] (3) refused to submit to a test pursuant to Section 56-5-2950 . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2951(F).Â Â  \r\nThe Department argues the trial court erred in reversing the administrative hearing officerâ€™s order because Taylor did not demonstrate how he was prejudiced by the fact that he did not receive a copy of the implied consent form from Officer Hamm.Â  We agree. \r\nIn State v. Huntley, 349 S.C. 1, 6, 562 S.E.2d 472, 474 (2002), the South Carolina Supreme Court reversed the trial court and held that the results of a breathalyzer test should not have been suppressed for a violation of section 56-5-2950 because the defendant was not prejudiced by the violation.Â  The trial court suppressed the breathalyzer test results because the breathalyzer operator tested the breathalyzer machine with a simulator test solution containing an alcohol level of .10 percent rather than the .08 percent mandated by statute.Â  The supreme court reasoned that because the test merely determined the reliability of the breathalyzer machineâ€™s results it was â€œirrelevant whether the simulator test [was operated] using an alcohol level of .10 or .08 percent.â€Â  Id.Â  The supreme court concluded, â€œEven if the breathalyzer operator did not use the simulator test solution at the alcohol concentration required by [section 56-5-2950], [the defendant] was not prejudiced.â€Â  Id.Â  Thus, the supreme court reversed the suppression of the breathalyzer test results because the defendant was not prejudiced by the statutory violation committed by the breathalyzer operator.Â  Consequently, the Huntley decision dictates that a violation of section 56-5-2950 without resulting prejudice will not lead to a suppression of the evidence obtained pursuant to this section.Â  \r\nTaylor argues he was not informed of the implied consent rights in writing as provided by section 56-5-2950.Â  Taylor does not argue that he did not receive the implied consent rights, or that he would have provided a blood test if he had received the implied consent rights in writing.Â  Therefore, Taylor was not prejudiced by the fact that Officer Hamm read the implied consent rights out loud.Â  Because Taylor was not prejudiced, the trial court erred in reversing the administrative hearing officerâ€™s order.Â Â Â Â  \r\nAccordingly, the order of the trial court is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nKITTREDGE, WILLIAMS, JJ., AND CURETON, A.J., CONCUR.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument, pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  Â \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-052","title":"Chavis v.

Chewning, III, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No.Â  2006-UP-052\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2006 â€“ Filed January 24, 2006\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Jean Perrin Derrick, of Lexington, for Appellant.\r\n        James W. Poag, Jr., of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â This is an action for modification of a child support obligation.Â  Wanda Lea Chavis, the mother and non-custodial parent, argues on appeal that the family court cited legally deficient reasons for refusing to reduce her support obligation to the amount that she would pay under a strict application of the South Carolina Child Support Guidelines.Â  We reverse and remand.[1]\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThe mother and Mark Glenn Chavis, the father, were divorced by decree filed December 1, 2000.Â  The mother was unrepresented by counsel during the divorce proceedings and did not file responsive pleadings or attend the final hearing.Â  The father received custody of the partiesâ€™ child, who was then twelve years old.Â  In addition, based on the fatherâ€™s reported gross monthly income of $780 per month and the imputation of minimum wage income of $893 per month to the mother, the family court ordered the mother to pay child support in the amount of $39 per week.Â  \r\nOn February 10, 2004, the mother commenced the present action by filing in forma pauperis a motion for temporary relief, summons, and complaint.[2]Â  In her pleadings, the mother alleged she had in fact been declared disabled by the Social Security Administration since 1992 and her only source of support was monthly supplemental security income payments of $564, plus food stamps.Â  \r\nAt a temporary hearing on March 4, 2004, the family court found the mother â€œhas made a prima facie showingâ€ of a change of circumstances and her sole income was social security benefits of $564 per month plus an additional $130 per month in food stamps.Â  Furthermore, as evidenced in his financial declaration, the father was earning $1,733 per month and paying a premium for health and dental insurance coverage for the child in the amount of $105 per month.\r\nAlthough strict application of the child support guidelines would have resulted in the reduction of the motherâ€™s child support obligation to $50 per month, the family court reduced her payments at the temporary hearing from $39 to $25 per week, citing the following as reasons for the deviation:Â  (1) this was a motion for temporary relief; (2) the mother was living with her boyfriend, and her financial declaration revealed few monthly living expenses; and (3) the father was providing medical and dental insurance for the child and the mother should assist him with this expense.Â  \r\nThe final hearing in the matter took place August 11, 2004.Â  Although the partiesâ€™ respective incomes had not changed since the temporary order, the child was now on Medicaid and the father was no longer paying the medical and dental insurance premium of $105 per month.Â  On August 30, 2004, the family court filed a final order in the case ordering that the motherâ€™s child support payments would remain at $25 per week.Â  Although the family court acknowledged in the final order that â€œ[a] strict application of the Guidelines would result in a monthly obligation of $50.00,â€ it found â€œspecial circumstances exist to justify a deviation from the Child Support Guidelines,â€ namely, that the mother was paying her boyfriend $350 per month for rent and had given him money while he was in prison.Â  On August 31, 2004, the mother filed a motion to alter or amend the final order, arguing that no special circumstances existed to warrant an upwards deviation from the child support guidelines.Â  The family court heard the motion on November 22, 2004.Â  On December 6, 2004, the family court filed an order denying the motion, prompting the mother to appeal to this court.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, the mother argues the family courtâ€™s refusal to adjust her support obligations to the proper amount according to the child support guidelines was an abuse of discretion.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œChild support awards are within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.â€[3]Â  â€œThe trial court abuses its discretion when factual findings are without evidentiary support or a ruling is based upon an error of law.â€[4]\r\nThe South Carolina Child Support Guidelines â€œare intended to govern all actions involving questions of child support.[5]Â  â€œAlthough the family court may deviate from the Child Support Guidelines, any deviation must be justified and should be the exception rather than the rule.â€[6]\r\nSouth Carolina Code section 43-5-580(b) authorizes the South Carolina Department of Social Services to â€œpromulgate regulations which establish guidelines for minimum contributions which must be applied by the courts in determining the amount that an absent parent is expected to pay toward the support of a dependent child.â€[7]Â  Although section 43-5-580 uses the term â€œminimum contributionsâ€ when describing the amount to be paid by a non-custodial parent, section 20-7-852(A) provides that â€œ[i]n any proceeding for the award of child support there is a rebuttable presumption that the amount of the award which would result from the application of the guidelines required under Section 43-5-580(b) is the correct amount of child support to be awarded.â€[8]Â  In addition, under Regulation 114-4710, which the Department of Social Services enacted pursuant to section 43-5-580, â€œ[i]n any proceeding in which child support is in issue, the amount of the award which would result from the application of these guidelines is the amount of the child support to be awarded.â€[9]Â  Although Regulation 114-4710 allows the family court to award different amounts, this can happen only â€œupon a showing that application of the guidelines is inappropriate.â€[10]Â  If the family court sets an amount of child support â€œthat varies significantly from the amount resulting from the application of the guidelines,â€ the regulation requires â€œspecific, written findings of those facts upon which [the court] bases its conclusion supporting that award.â€[11]Â  Regulation 114-4710(B) emphasizes the importance of using the child support guidelines, explaining as follows:Â  â€œDeviation from the guidelines should be the exception rather than the rule.Â  When the court deviates, it must make written findings that clearly state the nature and extent of the variation from the guidelines.â€[12]\r\nSection 20-7-852(C) lists twelve factors that â€œmay be possible reasons for deviation from the guidelines.â€[13]Â  An almost identical list appears in Regulation 114-4710(B), which notes that â€œ[t]hese Child Support Guidelines do not take into account the economic impact of the following factors which can be possible reasons for deviation.â€[14]\r\nApplying the foregoing legal premises to the case before us, we agree with the mother that the family court abused its discretion in deviating from the Child Support Guidelines when adjusting her support obligation.Â  \r\nFirst, contrary to what the father argues in his brief, we agree with the mother that, notwithstanding the fact that the family court reduced her child support obligation, the amount she was ordered to pay â€œvaries significantly from the amount resulting from the application of the guidelines.â€ Â For purposes of computing child support, the South Carolina Child Support Guidelines do not consider supplemental security income or food stamps as part of a parentâ€™s gross income.[15]Â  In the appealed order the family court noted that â€œ[a] strict application of the Guidelines would result in a monthly obligation of $50.00,â€ a statement in which counsel for both parties concur.Â  The amount the family court set in the final order, which computes to $108 per month, is more than twice what the mother should be paying under the guidelines.\r\nSecond, we believe the family courtâ€™s stated reasons for deviating from the child support guidelines are based on errors of law.Â  In our view, the family courtâ€™s refusal to adhere to the guidelines based on these reasons appears to reflect an unduly punitive assessment of the motherâ€™s current relationship with her boyfriend.Â  We are at a loss to understand how the motherâ€™s past gifts of money to her boyfriend while he was incarcerated or her present payments to him for rent fit into any of the twelve criteria enumerated by both the General Assembly and the Department of Social Services as reasons to deviate from the child support guidelines.Â  Moreover, the amount the mother reported to pay to her boyfriend for rent was never challenged as extravagant, and there was no evidence that the mother continued to bestow monetary gifts on her boyfriend after his release.\r\nFinally, after reviewing the record and briefs filed in this case, we have found nothing that would indicate that a strict application of the child support guidelines in this case would be â€œunjust or inappropriate,â€ such as a finding that the child had special needs requiring additional expenditures from both parents beyond the amount that the guidelines require them to pay.Â  To the contrary, the fatherâ€™s income increased significantly since the partiesâ€™ divorce and Medicaid is now paying the childâ€™s medical expenses.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the family courtâ€™s decision to allow the motherâ€™s child support payments to continue at $25 per week and remand this case to the family court to set support according to the South Carolina Child Support Guidelines.Â  Any adjustment in the motherâ€™s child support based on our rulings in this opinion shall be retroactive to August 30, 2004, the filing date of the final order issued by the family court.Â  On remand, the family court may in its discretion consider additional evidence relevant to the issue of child support,[16] including any appropriate circumstances warranting a deviation from the child support guidelines; however, any adjustment based on a change in circumstances since the final order shall take effect upon the filing of the order on remand.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issue on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  We note with gratitude to the motherâ€™s counsel that this was a pro bono representation both in the family court and in this appeal.\r\n[3]Â  Smith v.

Threlkeld, of Anderson, for Appellants.\r\nMark Stan Meglic, of Greenville and Stephanie Holmes Burton, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  H. William Chandler d/b/a GME Engineering (together, â€œGMEâ€) brought this action to foreclose a mechanicâ€™s lien against S &amp; T Enterprises of Anderson, Inc., the owner of commercial property, and The Summit of Anderson, the developer of the property.Â  S &amp; T Enterprises and The Summit, in turn, asserted counterclaims for breach of contract, breach of implied warranty, and professional negligence.Â  The trial court granted a directed verdict in favor of GME on all claims.Â  S &amp; T Enterprises and The Summit appeal.Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nI.Â  Mechanicâ€™s Lien. Â S &amp; T Enterprises and The Summit first contend the trial court erred in directing a verdict for GME on GMEâ€™s claim for foreclosure of a mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  They further contend the trial court erred in setting the amount of the verdict at $16,420.41, when the amount of the mechanicâ€™s lien as originally filed was $13,633.69.Â Â Â  \r\nSection 29-5-10(a) of the South Carolina Code provides a person furnishing labor or materials for a building or structure upon real estate may obtain a mechanicâ€™s lien to secure payment of the unpaid debt.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10(a) (Supp. 2005).Â  As used in this section, labor â€œincludes the preparation of plans, specifications, and design drawings and the work of making the real estate suitable as a site for the building or structure.â€Â  Id.\r\nThe agreement dated July 16, 2001, between GME and The Summit set forth an estimated cost of $16,200.00 and provided GME would submit monthly invoices to The Summit and a final bill upon completion of services.Â  Under the contract payment was â€œdue within fifteen days after the receipt of invoice and interest charges will start thirty days from invoice date.â€Â  The testimony showed GME had submitted invoices to The Summit and had previously stopped work on the project several times because of nonpayment of the invoiced amounts.Â Â Â  \r\nOn January 11, 2002, GME notified The Summit that it had not received all of the amounts previously invoiced and that the outstanding balance was then $13,256.41 and that it would be forced â€œonce againâ€ to stop work on the project until the balance due was paid.Â  GME stated it would submit permits for the project once the invoices were paid.Â  \r\nOn February 1, 2002, GME again notified The Summit that it had not received all of the amounts previously invoiced and attached a report showing a total invoiced amount of $18,256.41, with only $8,000.00 received in payment.Â  GME indicated it would be pleased to work on the permitting phase of the project once the invoices had been paid in full.Â  On February 6, 2002, GME wrote to The Summit and advised it was terminating the contract effective February 13th for continued nonpayment of the invoiced amounts.Â  GME sent three final invoices to The Summit dated February 7, 2002, for the additional amounts of $1,200.00, $2,177.28, and $2,786.72, giving a balance due of $16,420.41.Â  \r\nThe trial court concluded GME was â€œentitled to a directed verdict as to . . . [the] claim for foreclosure of the Mechanicâ€™s Lien in the amount of $16,420.41, interest, reasonable attorney fees and costs.â€Â  The trial court granted GMEâ€™s motion to amend its complaint to conform to the evidence to seek $16,420.41, although the original amount of the lien sought was $13,633.69.Â  \r\nWe hold the evidence supports GMEâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on its claim for foreclosure of a mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  The testimony establishes that GME improved the subject property through its labor, including the preparation of plans, specifications, designs, and drawings.Â  GME drafted conceptual drawings and conducted soil testing on the property, the results of which were submitted to The Summit on August 3, 2001.Â  GME also secured the services of Allees Landscape Architecture in Newberry, South Carolina, for the preparation of grading plans, utility drawings, and other items required by the partiesâ€™ contract.Â  GME subcontracted with Jamie McCutcheon, a registered engineer specializing in storm water runoff, who provided storm water calculations for the project site.Â  The Summit admittedly never paid GMEâ€™s invoices in full and the partial payments that it did make were untimely.Â Â Â  \r\nAs to the amount of the verdict awarded, GMEâ€™s counsel conceded during oral argument before this court that $2,786.72 included in the verdict was for an item not properly recoverable under the mechanicâ€™s lien statute and consented to the reduction of the judgment by this amount.[1]Â  Thus, based on counselâ€™s request and consent, the directed verdict in favor of GME on the claim for foreclosure of its mechanicâ€™s lien is affirmed as modified to reduce it by the amount of $2,786.72.Â Â Â  \r\nII.Â  Counterclaims.Â  S &amp; T Enterprises and The Summit next argue the trial court erred in directing a verdict in favor of GME on their counterclaims for breach of contract and professional negligence.[2]\r\nInitially, we note that, although the argument on the breach of contract claim incorporates a list of twenty factual allegations, no record cites are given for these facts; further, the argument contains no citations to legal authority.Â  See, e.g., Fields v. Melrose Ltd. Partnership, 312 S.C. 102, 106 n.3, 439 S.E.2d 283, 285 n.3 (Ct. App. 1993) (noting where the argument on appeal consists of short, conclusory statements without citation to supporting legal authority, the argument could be deemed abandoned).\r\nIn any case and as to the merits, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s decision to direct a verdict on the counterclaim for breach of contract.Â  In order to establish a claim for breach of contract, a party must prove (1) the existence of a contract between the parties, (2) a breach, and (3) damages proximately caused by such breach.Â  See Fuller v. E. Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 240 S.C. 75, 89, 124 S.E.2d 602, 610 (1962).\r\nThe evidence before the trial court was that GME had repeatedly sent invoices to The Summit that remained unpaid.Â  By February 2002, there was an outstanding balance of more than $10,000.00.Â  At that time, GME advised The Summit that it would no longer be working on the project.Â  Most of the project had been competed by GME, although it had not released its final plans and drawings due to the fact that the invoices were unpaid.Â  \r\nS &amp; T Enterprises and The Summit argue â€œ[t]he testimony and evidence elicited was susceptible to an inference that [GME] abandoned the contract without fulfilling its requirementsâ€ and caused them damages because they had to hire a successor engineer to complete the project.Â  All the evidence, however, suggests work on the project was terminated only for nonpayment of the invoices.Â  See Minter v. GOCT, Inc., 322 S.C. 525, 527, 473 S.E.2d 67, 69 (Ct. App. 1996) (stating â€œif the evidence does not yield more than one inference, a directed verdict in favor of the moving party is properâ€).Â Â  \r\nS &amp; T Enterprises and The Summit additionally argue the trial court erred in directing a verdict in favor of GME on their counterclaim for professional negligence.\r\nTo establish a claim for professional negligence, the plaintiff must prove the professionalâ€™s standard of care, the professionalâ€™s breach of that standard, and resulting damages proximately caused by the breach.Â \r\nWalker v. The Bluffs Apartments, 324 S.C. 350, 354, 477 S.E.2d 472, 474 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Generally, expert testimony is required to establish both the standard of care and the defendantâ€™s deviation from that standard.Â  Id.Â  â€œ[T]he standard of care that the plaintiff must prove is that the professional failed to conform to the generally recognized and accepted practices in his profession.â€Â  Doe v. Am. Red Cross Blood Servs., 297 S.C. 430, 435, 377 S.E.2d 323, 326 (1989).\r\nWe hold the trial court did not err in granting a directed verdict in favor of GME on the counterclaim for professional negligence.Â  S &amp; T Enterprises and The Summit correctly note that expert testimony is not required to establish the standard of care where the professional admits that the action complained of would amount to a violation of duty, relying on Sims v. Hall, 357 S.C. 288, 592 S.E.2d 315 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  They allege the owner of GME, William Chandler, expressly admitted his conduct violated his professional duty, thus conclusively determining the standard of care.Â  \r\nAt trial, Chandler was asked to assume, hypothetically, that he had advised The Summit that it was authorized to begin grading the subject property based on a prior grading permit issued in 1997 and to state whether this would have been incorrect and thus â€œa violation of [his] duty toâ€ The Summit.Â  The trial court found this generalized hypothetical did not sufficiently establish the standard of care of a professional engineer, and that an expert would be necessary to testify as to whether GME, through the actions of Chandler, met the applicable standard of care.Â Â Â  \r\nWe conclude Chandlerâ€™s brief testimony on this point does not establish the standard of care of a professional engineer, and even assuming Chandlerâ€™s testimony regarding the hypothetical did set the standard, as S &amp; T Enterprises and The Summit argue, there is no evidence reasonably sufficient to create a jury issue regarding whether GME breached the standard.Â  Thus, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision to grant a directed verdict to GME on the counterclaim for professional negligence.Â  Am. Red Cross Blood Servs., 297 S.C. at 435, 377 S.E.2d at 326 (â€œIf the plaintiff is unable to demonstrate that the professional failed to conform to the generally recognized and accepted practices in his profession, then the professional cannot be found liable as a matter of law.â€).Â  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  GME had sought a mechanicâ€™s lien of $13,633.69 in its original filing, but at trial it advised the court that it was seeking $16,420.41 because a final invoice for $2,786.72 had been inadvertently omitted from the total.Â  \r\n[2]Â  S &amp; T Enterprises and The Summit raise no issue on appeal regarding theirÂ  counterclaim for breach of implied warranty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-054","title":"State v.

McAlhany, of Summerville, for Appellant.\r\nJames B. Richardson, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: April Main (Mother) appeals from an order of the family court terminating her parental rights over her twin daughters, Anya and Azariah Haynes.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn November of 2001, while pregnant with twins, Mother went to the hospital because she was experiencing labor pains.Â  She tested positive for cocaine.Â  However, when the twins were born on December 13, 2001, neither of them tested positive for drugs.Â  DSS allowed mother to keep custody of the children, but required her to go to New Life, an inpatient treatment facility for drug addicts.Â  Mother was unsuccessfully discharged in February of 2002, and the twins were placed in the custody of Steve and Judy Hurley on February 26, 2002, when they were two-and-a-half months old.[2]Â  \r\nTonya McCants, the foster care caseworker assigned to Motherâ€™s case, testified that Mother was discharged from New Life after testing positive for drugs; however according to the discharge summary, Mother was discharged for arguing with staff.Â  McCants also testified at one point that the children were born addicted to drugs, then corrected herself and said Mother tested positive for drugs when the twins were born.Â  However, McCants had no documentation to support that allegation, and she could not explain why DSS would have waited until February 26, 2002 to take custody of the children if Mother had tested positive for drugs at the childrenâ€™s birth in December.Â  \r\nAt the time Mother was discharged from New Life, she was also on probation, a condition of which required her to successfully complete inpatient drug treatment.Â  Because her discharge was a violation of probation, Mother was incarcerated.Â  \r\nA hearing on the merits of the twinsâ€™ removal was held in March of 2001, and at that hearing, Mother and DSS agreed to a treatment plan.Â  Pursuant to the plan, Mother was required to complete a drug abuse counseling program; remain drug free; and upon her release from prison, seek stable housing and employment. \r\nWhile incarcerated, Mother enrolled in and completed drug treatment; she also completed a parenting class and participated in an educational skills class through which she received a certificate in keyboarding.Â  In addition to taking these classes, Mother sent letters to the twins, and DSS transported the twins to visit with Mother on at least seven occasions.Â  However, once DSS learned Mother would not be released from prison until fall of 2004, at the earliest, it recommended Motherâ€™s rights be terminated, and soon after that recommendation, visitation between Mother and the twins ceased.Â  \r\nDuring her incarceration, Mother never sent money to the twins, though in April of 2002, she wrote a letter to DSS explaining that she had received a $1,100 tax refund and wanted to know how to send the money to her daughters.Â  DSS received the letter, but McCants testified she â€œd[id] not thinkâ€ she ever responded to it.Â  When Mother testified, she was asked extensively about how she spent the $1,100.Â  Motherâ€™s answers were evasive, and she could not even recollect whether she had purchased anything in the prison canteen over the past year.Â  \r\nMother testified that once she is released, she plans to live with the twins in a halfway house called Step Ahead.Â  She explained that they would live there for three to six months until she was able to find permanent housing.Â  However, Mother admitted she had not yet been accepted into the Step Ahead program, though she and her counselor were â€œworking on it.â€Â  \r\nThe twins have thrived in their current placement with the Hurleys, who have four other adopted children.Â  By all accounts, the Hurleys provide a loving household and have the financial resources to continue to care for the twins throughout their lives.[3]Â  Â \r\nThe Hurleys filed a complaint in family court seeking to terminate Motherâ€™s parental rights to the twins on the grounds of the twins having languished in foster care for fifteen out of the last twenty-two months, Motherâ€™s failure to remedy conditions, Motherâ€™s diagnosable condition of substance abuse, and Motherâ€™s failure to support. Â The Hurleys also sought to adopt the twins.\r\nThe family court found the twins had been in foster care for fifteen out of the last twenty-two months, Mother had failed to support the twins for a period of six months, and Mother had failed to remedy conditions.Â  Based on these grounds and after finding termination was in the twinsâ€™ best interests, the family court terminated Motherâ€™s parental rights and granted the Hurleyâ€™s petition for adoption. This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nÂ â€œ[I]n a TPR case, the appellate court has jurisdiction to examine the entire record to determine facts in accordance with its own view of the evidence.â€Â  Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579-80, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing Richland County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Earles, 330 S.C. 24, 32, 496 S.E.2d 864, 866 (1998)).Â  In determining whether to terminate parental rights, the grounds for TPR must be proved by clear and convincing evidence and the best interest of the child is the paramount consideration.Â  Id. at 579, 578 S.E.2d at 735.Â  The appellate court may review the record and make its own findings as to whether clear and convincing evidence supports the TPR.Â  Id. (citing S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999)).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the findings of the trial court or to ignore the fact that the court was in a better position to assess the credibility of witnesses.Â  Id. at 580, 578 S.E.2d at 735 (citing Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996)).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMother first argues the family court erred in terminating her parental rights based on the grounds of failure to support and failure to remedy conditions.Â  However, she does not appeal from the family courtâ€™s finding that the twins were in foster care for fifteen of the last twenty-two months. That unappealed ground alone is sufficient to terminate Motherâ€™s parental rights so long as termination is in the twinsâ€™ best interests.Â  See S.C. Dept. of Soc. Servs. v. Sims, 359 S.C. 601, 598 S.E.2d 303 (Ct. App. 2004); Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 578 S.E.2d 733 (Ct. App. 2003) (finding that the ground of fifteen out of the last twenty-two months alone was sufficient to terminate Motherâ€™s parental rights when termination was in childâ€™s best interest).Â  Thus, we need not address whether there was sufficient evidence to support termination on the grounds of failure to remedy conditions and failure to support.\r\nMother next argues the family court erred in finding termination to be in the twinsâ€™ best interests.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt the time of the termination of parental rights hearing, the twins were two-and-a-half years old, and Mother had been incarcerated since they were just over two months old.Â  Though they have visited with Mother on seven occasions, the Hurleys have been the only parents the twins have ever known.Â  By everyoneâ€™s account, the twins have thrived while living with the Hurleys, and the Hurleysâ€™ home is a loving and stable environment.Â  \r\nMother, on the other hand, has a history of failing to parent her children.Â  Furthermore, although we commend Mother for completing drug treatment while in prison, we are concerned about her ability to remain drug-free upon her release.Â  According to Motherâ€™s own testimony, she successfully completed drug treatment in 1993, but was unable to stay clean. As the record shows, Mother did not even cease from drug-use while pregnant with the twins. Moreover, it is unclear where Mother will live upon her release from prison or what Mother will do to support herself and the twins.\r\nBased on these circumstances, we find no error in the family courtâ€™s termination of Motherâ€™s parental rights.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2004) (â€œThe family court may order the termination of parental rights upon a finding of one or more of the following grounds and a finding that termination is in the best interest of the child . . . .â€). Accordingly, the order of the family court is:\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and ANDERSON and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Mother has given birth to five other children in addition to the twins; however, none remain in Motherâ€™s custody.Â  The maternal grandmother adopted Motherâ€™s oldest child; Motherâ€™s second oldest child was privately adopted; Motherâ€™s parental rights to her third child were terminated in Florida; Mother consented to the adoption of her fourth child after DSS became involved; and Motherâ€™s fifth child lives with relatives of the father.Â  \r\n[3] Â In fact, the Hurleys have been named â€œAdoptive Family of the Yearâ€ and â€œOutstanding Volunteer Foster Parents of the Year.â€Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-057","title":"State v.

Elliott, and Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; and Solicitor John R. Justice, of Chester, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Marcus Barnes appeals his sentence of ten years for possession of a weapon during the commission of a crime of violence.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn September 2003, Barnes pled guilty to charges of assault with intent to kill, second-degree burglary, and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.Â  Barnes was sentenced to ten years in prison on each charge with the sentences to run concurrently.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBarnes appeals his sentence as to the weapons possession charge arguing that the relevant sentencing statute provides for a maximum sentence of five years.Â  He further asserts that the trial courtâ€™s sentencing error rendered his guilty pleas on all charges involuntary.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-490 (2003) provides:\r\n  \r\n(A)Â  If a person is in possession of a firearm or visibly displays what appears to be a firearm or visibly displays a knife during the commission of a violent crime and is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a violent crime as defined in Section 16-1-60, he must be imprisoned five years, in addition to the punishment provided for the principal crime. \r\n  \r\n\r\nAccording to the record and the sentence imposed, it appears that the trial court read this provision to mean that a sentence for the specific charge of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime could be as lengthy as five years, plus the maximum allowable sentence for the most serious underlying offense.Â  The maximum sentence for second-degree burglary is fifteen years.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-312(C) (2003).Â  The trial court concluded the maximum sentence on the weapons charge was therefore twenty years, and he sentenced Barnes to ten years.Â  \r\nRegardless of the propriety of the sentence, no objection was made to the sentencing explanation given or sentence imposed by the trial court.Â  Consequently, this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  State v. Johnston, 333 S.C. 459, 462, 510 S.E.2d 423, 425 (1999) (â€œ[T]his Court has consistently held that a challenge to sentencing must be raised at trial, or the issue will not be preserved for appellate review.â€).Â  Barnes should seek redress via an application for post-conviction relief.Â  See State v. Passmore, 363 S.C. 568, 586, 611 S.E.2d 273, 283 (Ct. App. 2005), cert. pending, (internal citations omitted) (â€œIn criminal cases, although the failure of\r\nan attorney to preserve an issue at trial will preclude appellate review of that issue, it may nonetheless be a ground in a civil action for post-conviction relief as a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.â€).Â  \r\nBarnes contends that an exception can be made to this rule where a defendant runs the risk of being incarcerated beyond the legal sentence due to the additional time it will take to pursue such a remedy.Â  See Johnston at 463-64, 510 S.E.2d at 425.Â  This is not such a case.Â  Barnes is serving ten-year sentences for the burglary and assault charges concurrently with his sentence on the weapons charge.Â  Consequently, his incarceration pursuant to the proper sentences for burglary and assault with intent to kill will continue for a period that should allow him ample time to pursue relief through the proper procedure.\r\nBarnes further argues that certain restrictions, including ineligibility for parole or work release, associated with the weapons charge could be applied to him for the entire ten-year period making it imperative that his appeal be expedited.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-490(C) (2003).Â  However, there is no reason to believe that the probation, pardon and parole board would impose those restrictions beyond the five-year period, assuming the ten-year sentence was excessive.Â  Furthermore, it is likely that Barnesâ€™ post-conviction relief application could be disposed of within the five-year period where such restrictions are mandated.Â  \r\nThe voluntariness of Barnesâ€™ pleas is likewise an issue not properly before this court.Â  A guilty plea is subject to attack on the issue of its being made knowingly and voluntarily, but absent a timely objection during the guilty plea proceeding, the unknowing or involuntary nature of the guilty plea cannot be raised on direct appeal but must be addressed through the more appropriate channel of post-conviction relief.Â  State v.

Horner, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Shannon Beish and her husband, Clarence Beish,[1] each brought suit against Scottish Inn after Shannon allegedly tripped and fell in the entryway to the motel due to a defective strip that covered a transition from the tile in the entryway to the carpet on the interior of the motel.Â  The trial court granted a directed verdict in favor of the Motel.Â  We affirm.\r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  It is well settled in South Carolina that â€œ[a] merchant is not the insurer of his customerâ€™s safety; rather, a merchant owes his customer the duty to exercise ordinary care to keep his premises in a reasonably safe condition.â€Â  Young v. Meeting Street Piggly Wiggly, 288 S.C. 508, 510, 343 S.E.2d 636, 637 (Ct. App. 1986). A customer seeking to recover damages for injuries sustained on a storekeeperâ€™s premises must show either: â€œ(1) that the injury was caused by a specific act of the [storekeeper] which created the dangerous condition; or (2) that the [storekeeper] had actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition and failed to remedy it.â€Â  Garvin v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 343 S.C. 625, 628, 541 S.E.2d 831, 832 (2001) (citations omitted).Â  The Beishes first argue the trial court erred in requiring them to â€œshow actual or constructive notice of a hazard or an impending hazard originating with the premises itself.â€Â  After reviewing the record, we find the trial court did not impose such a requirement.Â  To the contrary, in a pre-trial colloquy it was established that the Beishes theory of recovery was not based on notice, but rather that the motel created a dangerous condition that led to Shannonâ€™s injury.Â  Accordingly, we find this argument to be without merit.\r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â  The Beishes next argue the trial court erred in finding there was no evidence presented from which one could infer the motel had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition.Â  To support this argument they note that evidence was presented which showed the motel clerk was seated directly in front of the entrance and approximately ten feet from where Shannon fell.Â  However, the fact that the alleged dangerous condition was within an employeeâ€™s field of vision alone is not enough to prove the motelâ€™s negligence.Â Â Â  See e.g., Gillespie v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 302 S.C. 90, 91, 394 S.E.2d 24, 25 (Ct. App. 1990) (â€œThe mere fact that water was on the floor of the store and was within the field of vision of a nearby store employee at the time Gillespie slipped upon it is not by itself enough evidence to Wal-Mart with negligence.â€); Hunter v. Dixie Home Stores, 232 S.C. 139, 101 S.E.2d 262 (1957) (holding that even though two employees were standing in proximity to where plaintiff fell, one ten to twelve feet away and the other 25 or 30 feet away, this alone was not enough evidence to establish the defendant had notice of the dangerous condition).Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.  [2]\r\nSTILWELL, KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, J.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Shannon Beish brought a general negligence action and Clarence Beish brought a loss of consortium claim.Â  Although the cases were appealed to this court separately, because the issues complained of are identical, we combined the appeals for purposes of this decision.\r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-060","title":"State v.

Crosland, Jr., of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nJ. Hubert Wood, III, and J. Alexandra van Staveren, both of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Hank Singleton appeals the trial courtâ€™s denial and dismissal of his appeal from the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Singleton argues the trial court erred as a matter of law in failing to apply the appropriate methodology for calculating his average weekly wage as defined under section 42-1-40 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005).Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 9, 2000, Hank Singleton was involved in an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment with Stevens Shipping and Terminal Company at the Wando Terminal in Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina.Â  Singleton was operating a hustler machine when a crane picked up a container that was not properly detached and caused the hustler machine to be lifted and dropped.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAt the time of the accident, Singleton was a member of the Longshoreman Association and was classified as a Journeyman.Â  As a Journeyman, a classification achieved by working over seven hundred hours on the docks, Singleton was able to obtain seniority over newcomers and could get work before others.Â  Singleton had been working at the waterfront for about five years.Â  Just before his injury, Singleton worked, on average, three to four days a week and was only paid for the time he worked.Â  Â Singleton never made more than $7,000 a year.\r\nSingleton was chosen to be an Operator for the Nucor Scrap Gang.Â  However, Singleton was injured before the list was made public.Â  A typical member of the Nucor Scrap Gang earns $13.50 per hour, works ten to eleven hour days about seven days a week, and makes a weekly wage between $700 and $800.Â  \r\nA Single Commissioner of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission held a hearing on May 31, 2002 to determine if Stevens was required to pay compensation to Singleton.Â  The Commissioner found Singleton was entitled to compensation, and determined Singletonâ€™s compensation rate was $86.78 based on an average weekly wage of $130.10.Â  The average weekly wage was reached by taking one half of Singletonâ€™s earnings for 1999, combining those with his earnings from 2000, and dividing the total by forty-nine weeks (the number of weeks from July 1, 1999 through date of Singletonâ€™s injury).Â  The Commissioner cited Singletonâ€™s sporadic work history, Singletonâ€™s documented earnings for 1999 and 2000, Singletonâ€™s admission that he has never earned more than $7,000 in a calendar year, and testimony indicating Singleton had a little more than seven hundred documented work hours on the waterfront since becoming a longshoreman in 1996, as evidence supporting the decision.Â  \r\nSingleton appealed the Commissionerâ€™s decision to the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  The Commission affirmed the Single Commissionerâ€™s order in its entirety.Â  \r\nSingleton appealed the Commissionâ€™s decision to the trial court.Â  The trial court found substantial evidence to support the Commissionâ€™s decision, and therefore, denied and dismissed Singletonâ€™s appeal.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act governs judicial review of a decision of an administrative agency.â€Â  Clark v. Aiken County Govâ€™t, 366 S.C. 102, 107, 620 S.E.2d 99, 101 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 1-23-310 to -400 (Supp. 2005)). Â Section 1-23-380(A)(6) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) establishes the substantial evidence rule as the standard of review.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 133, 276 S.E.2d 304, 305 (1981).Â  Under this standard, a reviewing court may reverse or modify an agency decision based on errors of law, but may only reverse or modify an agencyâ€™s findings of fact if they are clearly erroneous. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(d) and (e) (Supp. 2005).Â  \r\nâ€œ[T]his court must affirm an award of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission in which the circuit court concurred if substantial evidence supports the findings.â€ Â Solomon v. W.B. Easton, Inc., 307 S.C. 518, 520, 415 S.E.2d 841, 843 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached to justify its action.â€ Â Howell v. Pac. Columbia Mills, 291 S.C. 469, 471, 354 S.E.2d 384, 385 (1987).Â  â€œThe possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent the commissionâ€™s findings from being supported by substantial evidence.â€Â  Sellers v. Pinedale Residential Ctr., 350 S.C. 183, 188, 564 S.E.2d 694, 697 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSingleton argues the trial court failed to apply the appropriate methodology for calculating his average weekly wage.Â  We disagree. \r\n\r\nSection 42-1-40 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) provides:\r\n  \r\nâ€˜Average weekly wagesâ€™ means the earnings of the injured employee in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury during the period of fifty-two weeks immediately preceding the date of the injury . . . . â€˜Average weekly wageâ€™ must be calculated by taking the total wages paid for the last four quarters immediately preceding the quarter in which the injury occurred . . . divided by fifty-two or by the actual number of weeks for which wages were paid, whichever is less.Â  [portions omitted]\r\nWhen for exceptional reasons the foregoing would be unfair, either to the employer or employee, such other method of computing average weekly wages may be resorted to as will most nearly approximate the amount which the injured employee would be earning were it not for the injury.\r\n  \r\n\r\nâ€œThe statute provides an elasticity or flexibility with a view toward always achieving the ultimate objective of reflecting fairly a claimantâ€™s probable future earning loss.â€Â  Sellers, 350 S.C. at 191, 564 S.E.2d at 698.Â  â€œMoreover, it is well established that the objective of wage calculation is to arrive at a fair approximation of the claimantâ€™s probable future earning capacity.â€Â  Elliott v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 362 S.C. 234, 238, 607 S.E.2d 90, 92 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nThe Commissioner found no exceptional circumstances to justify the calculation of an average weekly wage based on speculative future earnings.Â  We find, based on the substantial evidence standard of review, reasonable minds could reach the conclusion the Commissioner and, subsequently, the Commission reached.Â  Singletonâ€™s pay and hours are both speculative because, at the time of the injury, he had not started working with the Nucor Scrap Gang. Â In fact, the record indicates Singleton was never offered a job with the Nucor Scrap Gang; Singleton was merely â€œchosen to be the operatorâ€ but before the list was put out, he was injured.Â  In addition, Singleton had an established work history and no demonstrated commitment to working more than three or four days a week.[2]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the above, we find the trial court did not err in dismissing and denying Singletonâ€™s appeal.Â  The decision of the trial court is accordingly \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE, WILLIAMS, JJ., AND CURETON, A.J.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument, pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n[2] We note that this case can be distinguished from cases when the reviewing court found exceptional circumstances existed.Â  In those cases, either the claimant had a guaranteed, proven raise or other exceptional circumstances existed that are not present here.Â  See, e.g., Elliott, 362 S.C. at 238, 607 S.E.2d at 92 (finding exceptional circumstances when the claimant was given a merit based award that was not speculative and was already in place at the time of the accident); see also, Booth v. Midland Trane Heating &amp; Air Conditioning, 298 S.C. 251, 379 S.E.2d 730 (Ct. App. 1989) (finding claimantâ€™s average weekly wage should be calculated based solely on new wage because raise given four months before injury); see also Sellers, 350 S.C. 183, 564 S.E.2d 694 (Ct. App. 2002) (affirming Commissionâ€™s finding that exceptional circumstances existed to calculate wage based on future projections when claimant was young, seriously injured, and had a good work ethic). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
