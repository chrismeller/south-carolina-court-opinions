Savitz, III, of the South \r\n  Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W.

Morgan, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The family court adjudicated \r\n  Justin B., a minor under the age of seventeen, delinquent, finding he had committed \r\n  first-degree criminal sexual conduct.Â  The court later reduced the offense to \r\n  assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature and committed the juvenile \r\n  to the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice for an indeterminate period, \r\n  not to exceed the juvenileâ€™s twenty-first birthday.Â  The juvenile contends the \r\n  court erred when it found the four-year-old victim competent to testify.Â  We \r\n  reverse and remand.\r\nThis action began upon the filing of \r\n  a juvenile petition in which the juvenile is alleged to have committed first-degree \r\n  criminal sexual conduct on a two-year-old male [1]  in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  16-3-655(1) (1976 as amended) by having the two-year-old child perform fellatio.Â  \r\n  At the hearing, when the state called the child, then four years old, to \r\n  the witness stand, the following occurred:\r\n\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Good morning.\r\nTHE WITNESS:Â  Good morning.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  What is your name?\r\nTHE WITNESS: [The witness responds with his name.]\r\nTHE COURT:Â  . . . [I]n just a minute, some of these folks \r\n  are going to ask you some questions.Â  This man right here might ask you some \r\n  questions, and this man right here might ask you some questions.Â  Can you answer \r\n  their questions for me?Â  Tell me yes or no.Â  Are you going to answer their questions?\r\nTHE WITNESS:Â  Yes.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Now, . . . I am the Judge in this case.Â  Do you \r\n  understand that?\r\nTHE WITNESS:Â  Yeah.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Good.Â  You can talk good and loud.Â  Now, when \r\n  these gentlemen ask you a question, I want you to tell them the truth.Â  Do you \r\n  understand that?\r\nTHE WITNESS:Â  Yes.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Do you know what the truth is?Â  See that lady \r\n  over there, when you say yes or no, it comes through on this microphone. Stand \r\n  up there closer to the microphone.Â  Now, say â€œyes,â€ for me one time.\r\nTHE WITNESS:Â  Yes.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Did you hear how good it comes through the microphone?Â  \r\n  When I ask you questions, I want you to say the answer into the microphone, \r\n  okay?Â  Can you do that?Â  Are you going to tell these men the truth?\r\nTHE WITNESS:Â  I donâ€™t know.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Oh, you donâ€™t know now?Â  A while ago you told \r\n  me you were going to tell me the truth.Â  Letâ€™s see if we can try to get through \r\n  this.Â  They are going to ask you some questions, and I want you to tell them \r\n  the truth, okay?Â  Do you understand what the truth is?\r\nTHE WITNESS:Â  (Nods head.)\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Do you understand what a lie is?\r\nTHE WITNESS:Â  Yes.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Okay.Â  I am going to let yâ€™all start with the \r\n  questions.Â  I am not going to make any ruling at this point in time.Â  I will \r\n  let him go through with the questions.Â  He told me he understands what telling \r\n  the truth is and not telling the truth is.Â  The main thing is, he needs to just \r\n  answer the question.Â  And we will note for the record when he nods his head \r\n  and when he shakes his head.\r\nMR. WILSON:Â  Your Honor, will we be allowed, very brief [sic] \r\n  to question him on competency?\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Yes, I will let you do that.\r\nBY MR. WILSON:\r\nQ.Â  . . . What is your real name?\r\nA.Â  [Name given.]\r\nQ.Â  How old are you . . . ?\r\nA.Â  Four years old.\r\nQ.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Four years old now?Â  Are you in school yet?\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Uh-huh.\r\nQ.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Where are you in school?\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â [Supplies name.]\r\nQ.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â [Name of school]?Â  Is that what you said, [name of school]?Â  \r\n  Do you remember your teacherâ€™s name?Â  What is your teacherâ€™s name?\r\nA.Â  [Supplies name.]\r\nQ.Â  What is your mamaâ€™s name?\r\nA.Â  [Supplies name.]\r\nQ.Â  Do you live with your mama?\r\nA.Â  (Nods head.)\r\nQ.Â  Does anybody else live in the house \r\n  with you?\r\nA.Â  Yes.\r\nQ.Â  Who else?\r\nA.Â  My daddy.\r\nQ.Â  What is his name?\r\nA.Â  Dad-Dad.\r\nQ.Â  Do you know what the truth is . . \r\n  . ?\r\nA.Â  Yeah.\r\nQ.Â  Do you know what a lie is?Â  Can you tell me what you \r\n  think a lie is?\r\nA.Â  That you dig up dirt.\r\nQ.Â  Can you say that again for me?\r\nA.Â  That you dig up dirt.\r\nQ.Â  That you dig up dirt, thatâ€™s a lie?Â  Do you know what \r\n  happens if you tell the truth?Â  What happens if you tell the truth?\r\nA.Â  You get a beating.\r\nQ.Â  You get a beating?Â  And what happens if you tell a lie?\r\nA.Â  You get a beating.\r\nMR. WILSON:Â Â Â Â  Thatâ€™s all I have, your Honor.\r\nTHE SOLICITOR:Â  No questions.\r\n\r\nThe trial court held the child competent \r\n  to testify, remarking:\r\n\r\nTHE COURT:Â  All right.Â  Mr. Wilson, I am going to let him \r\n  testify.Â  I understand he answers one of your questions that he might get a \r\n  beating if he tells the truth.Â  But prior to that, you had asked him a question \r\n  about lying, and he said, â€œDig up dirt.â€Â  And you asked him what happens if \r\n  he tells the truth, and you changed it.Â  I am going to go ahead and let him \r\n  testify.\r\n\r\nWe understand that the qualification of a witness \r\n  is within the trial courtâ€™s discretion and that a trial courtâ€™s ruling will \r\n  be reversed only for an abuse thereof.Â  State v. Hudnall, 293 S.C. 97, \r\n  359 S.E.2d 59 (1987), overruled on other grounds \r\n  by State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 435 S.E.2d 859 (1993).Â  We \r\n  are also aware that, under Rule 601(a), SCRE, â€œ[e]very person is competent to \r\n  be a witness except as otherwise provided by statute or these rulesâ€; however, \r\n  Rule 601(b)(2), SCRE, provides, â€œA person is disqualified to be a witness if \r\n  the court determines that . . . the proposed witness is incapable of understanding \r\n  the duty of a witness to tell the truth.â€Â  \r\nWe think the Rule 601(b)(2) exception to the presumption \r\n  of competency applies here and hold the family court committed reversible error \r\n  in finding the child competent to testify.Â  Like the supreme court was in Hudnall, \r\n  â€œwe are convinced this child could not be held morally accountable for telling \r\n  a lie.â€Â  Hudnall, 293 S.C. at 99, 359 S.E.2d at 61.Â  A lie is not, as \r\n  the child defined it, â€œdigging up dirt,â€ for the truth may be found in â€œdirtâ€ \r\n  just as well.Â  Notably absent from the record is any demonstration that the \r\n  child understood the difference between lying and telling the truth. \r\nAs to the childâ€™s answering â€œYou get a beatingâ€ \r\n  to the question â€œWhat happens if you tell the truth,â€ the child was twice \r\n  asked the question before he answered.Â  Although the inquiry turned from telling \r\n  a lie to telling the truth, there was nothing confusing or misleading about \r\n  this rather simple, straightforward question.Â  Particularly troubling, the child \r\n  gave the identical answer to the question of â€œ[W]hat happens if you tell a lie?â€Â  \r\n  We think the same response by the child to questions about what happens when \r\n  you tell a lie and when you tell the truth and his defining a lie as â€œdigging \r\n  up dirtâ€ demonstrated the child did not understand the duty to tell the truth.Â  \r\n  See State v. Needs, 333 S.C. 134, 143, 508 S.E.2d 857, 861 (1998) \r\n  (â€œA proposed witness understands the duty to tell the truth when he states that \r\n  he knows that it is right to tell the truth and wrong to lie, that he will tell \r\n  the truth if permitted to testify, and that he fears punishment if he does lie \r\n  . . . .â€). \r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\nGOOLSBY, HOWARD, and KITTREDGE, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  Testimony at the hearing indicated, and the family court so \r\n    found, the victim was three years old at the time the petition alleges the \r\n    incident happened.Â  The record does not show the age of the juvenile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-238","title":"Loadholt v.

Charles McLendon, and three \r\n  unknown officers of the Georgetown County Sheriffâ€™s Department (collectively, \r\n  â€œRespondentsâ€) in this action for negligence and malicious prosecution.Â  We \r\n  affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn May 16, 1998, Deputy McLendon \r\n  initiated a traffic stop of Loadholt, an African-American correctional officer \r\n  at the J. Rueben Long Detention Center, while Loadholt was driving to work.Â  \r\n  Loadholt was dressed in his uniform at the time.Â Â  Following a request by \r\n  Deputy McLendon for assistance, at least three other unknown deputies arrived \r\n  on the scene.Â  All of the deputies on the scene were Caucasian.Â  The deputies \r\n  searched Loadholt and his car and, after finding nothing incriminating, Loadholt \r\n  was issued a ticket for careless operation of a vehicle.Â  The ticket was dismissed \r\n  by a magistrate, without a hearing, on July 23, 1998.Â Â Â  \r\nOn October 12, 2001, Loadholt filed an \r\n  action against Sheriff Cribb, McLendon, and the three unknown deputies, alleging \r\n  malicious prosecution and negligence.Â  According to his complaint, although \r\n  Loadholt was cooperative and respectful to McLendon and the other officers during \r\n  the stop and search, he was referred to with the use of â€œracial slurs,â€ insulted \r\n  by being told he was â€œa disgrace to his uniform,â€ and verbally assaulted by \r\n  all the deputies.Â  Loadholt alleged the criminal proceedings were instituted \r\n  â€œwith malice and without probable cause,â€ and only because of his race.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  Loadholt alleged Respondents were engaged in malicious prosecution of him.Â  \r\n  Loadholt also alleged that Sheriff Cribb was negligent in failing to properly \r\n  train his officers to respect their positions, to not discriminate on the basis \r\n  of race, and to arrest only on the existence of probable cause. \r\nRespondents moved for summary judgment, \r\n  arguing Loadholtâ€™s claims were governed by the South Carolina Tort Claims Act \r\n  (â€œTort Claims Actâ€) [1]  and were not timely filed pursuant \r\n  to the act.Â  After Loadholtâ€™s counsel asserted Loadholt had a claim under 42 \r\n  U.S.C. Â§ 1983, Respondents pointed out that no allegations in Loadholtâ€™s complaint \r\n  raised a section 1983 claim.Â Â  Loadholt argued the allegations raised in his \r\n  complaint supported a cause of action against the sheriff under section 1983.Â  \r\n  Loadholt conceded he could not pursue an action for negligence against Sheriff \r\n  Cribb. \r\nIn an order dated August 19, 2002, the circuit \r\n  court granted Respondentsâ€™ request for summary judgment as to both causes of \r\n  action.Â  The court found the Tort Claims Act provided the exclusive remedy for \r\n  torts committed by governmental employees, and, thus, Loadholtâ€™s cause of action \r\n  for malicious prosecution was subject to the Actâ€™s two-year statute of limitations.Â  \r\n  Because the suit was not filed until three years after the dismissal of Loadholtâ€™s \r\n  ticket, the circuit court found the suit was time barred.Â  \r\nThe court also found Loadholtâ€™s complaint did not \r\n  allege facts that would support a cause of action under section 1983.Â  The court \r\n  noted the complaint did not mention section 1983, nor did it allege that any \r\n  of Loadholtâ€™s federal rights were violated.Â Â  Loadholt appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn appellate court reviews the grant of a summary \r\n  judgment motion under the same standard applied by the trial court under Rule \r\n  56(c), SCRCP.Â  Fisher v. Stevens, 355 S.C. 290, 294, 584 S.E.2d 149, \r\n  151 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing Baughman v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., \r\n  306 S.C. 101, 410 S.E.2d 537 (1991)).Â  Rule 56(c) provides summary judgment \r\n  is appropriate when â€œthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . \r\n  . . the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), \r\n  SCRCP.Â  In determining whether triable issues of fact exist such as will preclude \r\n  summary judgment, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn \r\n  therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  \r\n  McNair v. Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, 341, 499 S.E.2d 488, 493 (Ct. App. \r\n  1998).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Tort Claims Act\r\nA.\r\nLoadholt argues the circuit court erred by applying \r\n  the limitations period contained in the Tort Claims Act to his cause of action \r\n  for malicious prosecution because the Respondentsâ€™ actions fell within an exception \r\n  to the Tort Claims Act.Â  Thus, he argues the three-year statute of limitations \r\n  provided by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530 (Supp. 2003) applied and the circuit court \r\n  erred in granting summary judgment.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Tort Claims Act provides the â€œexclusive \r\n  civil remedy available for any tort committed by a governmental entity, its \r\n  employees, or its agents except as provided in Section 15-78-70(b).â€Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-78-20(b) (Supp. 2003) (emphasis added).Â  Section 15-78-70(b) provides \r\n  an exception for certain actions on the part of the state employee: \r\n\r\nNothing in this chapter may be construed to give an employee \r\n  of a governmental entity immunity from suit and liability if it is proved that \r\n  the employeeâ€™s conduct was not within the scope of his official duties or that \r\n  it constituted actual fraud, actual malice, intent to harm, or a crime involving \r\n  moral turpitude. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-70(b) (Supp. 2003).Â  There is a two-year \r\n  statute of limitations period for actions brought pursuant to the Tort Claims \r\n  Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-110 (Supp. 2003) (providing that with the exception \r\n  of persons under a disability as provided for in Section 15-3-40, â€œ. . . any \r\n  action brought pursuant to this chapter is forever barred unless an action is \r\n  commenced within two years after the date the loss was or should have been discoveredâ€).Â  \r\n\r\nAt the summary judgment hearing, Respondents argued \r\n  Loadholtâ€™s claims fell within the purview of the Tort Claims Act and, as such, \r\n  the action was governed by the two-year limitations period contained therein.Â  \r\n  Considering the ticket was issued on May 16, 1998, dismissed on July 23, 1998, \r\n  and Loadholtâ€™s suit was not initiated until October 12, 2001, more than three \r\n  years later, the claims did not fall within the time period allotted by the \r\n  Tort Claims Act.Â  Accordingly, Respondents asserted the claims were time barred. \r\n  Â Loadholt did not contest that more than three years elapsed from the \r\n  time the ticket was dismissed until the action was filed.Â  However, Loadholt \r\n  asserted he did not know the ticket had been dismissed until October 16, 1998.Â  \r\n  He argued a question of fact was raised as to this issue, and a jury should \r\n  have determined whether the action was filed before the appropriate limitations \r\n  period expired. \r\nThe evidence presented at the summary judgment hearing included \r\n  affidavits by McLendon and Cribb wherein they denied any wrongdoing in the performance \r\n  of their duties.Â  In his affidavit, McLendon stated that on the date of the \r\n  incident, he saw Loadholt â€œtearing down the road going real fast.â€Â  According \r\n  to McLendon, Loadholt did not stop for his blue light, so McLendon summoned \r\n  other officers to the scene for assistance.Â Â  McLendon estimated Loadholtâ€™s \r\n  speed at the time to have been between sixty and sixty-five miles per hour in \r\n  a thirty-five per hour zone.Â  McLendon averred that no racial slurs were used \r\n  by any of the officers.Â  \r\nLoadholtâ€™s deposition was also submitted at the hearing.Â  \r\n  Although Loadholt stated in his deposition that the officers were rude to him \r\n  during the stop and search, Loadholt never testified to any malicious behavior \r\n  and did not mention anything regarding racial slurs. \r\nViewing this evidence in the light most favorable to Loadholt, \r\n  there was no evidence that the officersâ€™ actions fell within the exception to \r\n  the Tort Claims Act.Â  Because the Tort Claims Act provides the â€œexclusiveâ€ remedy \r\n  for torts committed by governmental employees, unless an exception applies, \r\n  the statute of limitations contained within the act will apply.Â  See \r\n  Joubert v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 341 S.C. 176, 185, 534 \r\n  S.E.2d 1, 5 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding that because nothing in Section 15-78-70(b) \r\n  references a limitations period, as part of the Tort Claims Act, it is still \r\n  subject to the Tort Claims Actâ€™s two-year statute of limitations).Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the circuit court did not err in finding Loadholtâ€™s action fell within the purview \r\n  of the Tort Claims Act and the applicable two-year statute of limitations applied.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nB.\r\nTurning to the claim of malicious prosecution, one element \r\n  necessary to maintain an action for malicious prosecution is that the judicial \r\n  proceedings be terminated in the plaintiffâ€™s favor.Â  Jordan v. Deese, \r\n  317 S.C. 260, 261-62, 452 S.E.2d 838, 839 (1995); 52 Am. Jur. 2d Malicious \r\n  Prosecution Â§28 (2000).Â  Thus, the cause of action does not accrue, and \r\n  the statute of limitations does not begin to run, until after the proceedings \r\n  are terminated in the plaintiffâ€™s favor.Â  Loadholtâ€™s ticket was dismissed July \r\n  23, 1998, and thus the cause of action for malicious prosecution accrued on \r\n  that date.Â  Loadholt alleged: he discovered the dismissal in October 1998; the \r\n  cause of action did not accrue until that time; and his October 12, 2001, complaint \r\n  was timely filed pursuant to the general three-year statute of limitations.Â  \r\n  Regardless of which date you refer to, Loadholt clearly filed his action three \r\n  years after the accrual and outside the Tort Claims Actâ€™s two-year statute of \r\n  limitations.Â  \r\nBecause Loadholtâ€™s cause of action fell within the Tort Claims \r\n  Act and was brought more than three years after it accrued, we find the circuit \r\n  court did not err in determining Loadholtâ€™s claim was time barred.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  summary judgment on his claim of malicious prosecution was proper.Â  \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983 \r\n   \r\nLoadholt also contends the circuit court erred in finding \r\n  that the complaint did not assert a cause of action under section 1983.Â  He \r\n  asserts that while he â€œinartfully couched his second cause of action in terms \r\n  of negligence,â€ he actually alleged Sheriff Cribb violated his civil rights, \r\n  thus supporting an action pursuant to section 1983.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 42 U.S.C. 1983 provides liability for persons \r\n  who, acting under color of state law, deprive United States citizens of the \r\n  rights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution or laws of the \r\n  United States.Â  See Banks v. Med. Univ. of South Carolina, 314 \r\n  S.C. 376, 382, 444 S.E.2d 519, 522 (1994).Â  The limitations period for actions \r\n  brought pursuant to section 1983 is adopted from a state courtâ€™s statute governing \r\n  an analogous cause of action.Â  See Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. \r\n  261, 271 (1985) (holding that courts must adopt a â€œpersonal injuryâ€ statute \r\n  of limitations period in state court in section 1983 actions).Â  In South Carolina, \r\n  the general three-year limitations period for personal injury actions found \r\n  in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(5) (Supp. 2003) would apply.\r\nLoadholtâ€™s cause of action for negligence against \r\n  Sheriff Cribb alleged that the sheriff was negligent in failing to train his \r\n  officers: (1) not to abuse their authority, (2) to refrain from discriminating \r\n  on the basis of race; (3) to make arrests only upon the issuance of probable \r\n  cause; and (4) to not use race as an element of probable cause.Â Â  Loadholt further \r\n  alleged in his complaint that as a result of the sheriffâ€™s failure to properly \r\n  train his deputies, he suffered emotional distress and deserved damages.Â  \r\nThe trial court found not only that Loadholt did \r\n  not mention 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983 in his complaint, but that he also failed to allege \r\n  facts sufficient to support a cause of action thereunder.Â  We agree.Â  Loadholt \r\n  has not alleged that any federal right has been violated by the Respondents.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, he has failed to properly plead a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \r\n  Â§ 1983.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nTherefore, based on the above reasoning, the circuit \r\n  courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ.,Â  and CURETON, AJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  S.C.

Harlow, of Aiken, for Appellant.\r\nSylvia W. Westerdahl, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is a divorce action between \r\n  Harris M. Linder and Angela C. Linder.Â  Husband appeals the family courtâ€™s order, \r\n  alleging the court erred in refusing to apportion personal property, in requiring \r\n  Husband to pay a portion of Wifeâ€™s non-marital debt, in considering Wifeâ€™s motion \r\n  to alter or amend, and in failing to include Wifeâ€™s pension in the apportionment \r\n  of marital property.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. \r\n  [1] \r\nBACKGROUND\r\nHusband and Wife married in 1986 and separated \r\n  in 2001.Â  In its final order, filed on March 18, 2002, the family court granted \r\n  a divorce on the ground of one-year continuous separation and awarded Wife the \r\n  marital home and Husband a motorcycle.Â  The court also found $16,400 in unsecured \r\n  marital debt and apportioned the debt according to income, ordering Husband \r\n  to pay 39% of the marital debt and Wife to pay 61%.Â  However, the family court \r\n  refused to apportion the personal property and referred the parties to magistrateâ€™s \r\n  court to divide the property.Â  \r\nHusband timely filed a motion to alter \r\n  or amend the judgment.Â  He requested the court divide the personal property, \r\n  exclude from the equitable distribution a portion of the debt he believed Wife \r\n  incurred post-separation, and include Wifeâ€™s pension in the property division.Â  \r\n  Wife filed a motion to alter or amend on April 8, 2002.Â  Husband moved to dismiss \r\n  the motion, alleging it was not timely.Â  The court allowed Wife to proceed with \r\n  her motion.Â  The court denied Husbandâ€™s motion and granted Wifeâ€™s motion, declaring, \r\n  among other things, that Husband had no interest in Wifeâ€™s pension plan.Â  Husband \r\n  appeals.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has \r\n  the authority to find facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.Â  Greene v. Greene, 351 S.C. 329, 335, 569 S.E.2d 393, \r\n  397 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  This broad scope of review does not require us to disregard \r\n  the findings of the family court.Â  Id.Â  Neither are we required to ignore \r\n  the fact that the family court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in \r\n  a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight \r\n  to their testimony.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Family Courtâ€™s Refusal to Apportion Personal Property\r\nAt the final hearing, Husband and Wife presented \r\n  the court with lists of personal property.Â  Husbandâ€™s list provided a value \r\n  for virtually every item of personal property.Â  Wifeâ€™s list, however, did not \r\n  contain values for most items.Â  Both Husband and Wife argue the family court \r\n  erred by refusing to apportion personal property and, instead referring the \r\n  parties to magistrateâ€™s court.Â  We agree and remand for resolution ofÂ  this \r\n  issue. \r\nThe family court has exclusive jurisdiction \r\n  over a divorce and the settlement of all legal and equitable rights of the parties \r\n  in and to the real and personal property of the marriage.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  20-7-420(2) (Supp. 2003).Â  Because the family court has exclusive jurisdiction \r\n  over this issue, the magistrateâ€™s court is without jurisdiction and, therefore, \r\n  the family courtâ€™s order left the parties without a remedy for dividing the \r\n  personal property.Â  The family court clearly erred when it found it had â€œno \r\n  wayâ€ to value and divide the personal property and referred the parties to magistrateâ€™s \r\n  court for a division of the property.Â  Based on the above, we remand this issue \r\n  to the family court for further proceedings to apportion the personal property.\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Wifeâ€™s Post-Separation Debt\r\nWife obtained a loan from Beneficial Finance in \r\n  March 1999, nearly two years prior to the partiesâ€™ separation.Â  Wife testified \r\n  she incurred an additional $5,300 on the Beneficial loan after the parties separated, \r\n  increasing the total due on that debt to $13,349.Â  Husband claims the family \r\n  court required him to pay 39% of this post-separation debt.Â  We disagree and \r\n  find the family court judge ordered Husband to pay 39% of the marital \r\n  debt, only.Â  \r\nThe family court found the total marital \r\n  debt to be $16,400.Â  Although the record does not show the exact calculation \r\n  the court used to arrive at this figure, based on the total amount he found \r\n  it appears the court determined the marital debt on the Beneficial loan to be \r\n  $8,000, which is consistent with Wifeâ€™s records and testimony ($13,349-$5,300=$8,049).Â  \r\n  When this figure is added to the sum Husband claimed was marital unsecured debt \r\n  on various charge cardsâ€”$8,400â€”the marital debt totals $16,400.Â  Based on the \r\n  records and testimony before us, we agree this is a correct total of the marital \r\n  debt.Â  In apportioning this debt, the court ordered Husband to pay $3,700 to \r\n  Loweâ€™s, $1,700 to Sears, and $996 to Visa, for a total of $6,396, which is 39% \r\n  of the $16,400 marital debt.Â  We do not discern an abuse of discretion by the \r\n  family court judge in requiring Husband to pay the amount ordered.Â  \r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wifeâ€™s Rule \r\n  59(e), SCRCP Motion\r\nHusband claims the family court erred in allowing \r\n  Wifeâ€™s Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion because it was not timely filed.Â  We disagree.\r\nAlthough the family court believed Wifeâ€™s \r\n  motion was not timely filed, he determined the record failed to sustain such \r\n  a finding because it did not show when the order was served on Wifeâ€™s attorney.Â  \r\n  Therefore, the court heard Wifeâ€™s motion.Â  \r\n Being mindful of our standard of review \r\n  in this case, we do not disregard the findings of the family court on this issue.Â  \r\n  Greene, 351 S.C. at 335, 569 S.E.2d at 397.Â  We find no error in allowing \r\n  Wifeâ€™s motion.Â  This was a factual determination the court was free to make. \r\n\r\n  IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wifeâ€™s \r\n  Pension\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in failing \r\n  to include Wifeâ€™s pension in the apportionment.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œA spouse who wishes to claim that certain property \r\n  is not a part of the marital estate has the burden of presenting witnesses or \r\n  evidence to establish its non-marital character and also to give the trial court \r\n  an opportunity to decide the issue.â€Â  Hodge v. Hodge, 305 S.C. 521, 526, \r\n  409 S.E.2d 436, 439-40 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  \r\nHere, Wife never attempted to prove her pension \r\n  was non-marital.Â  To the contrary, counsel for the parties discussed equitable \r\n  division of the pension when the court asked about issues on which the parties \r\n  agreed.Â  When Wifeâ€™s counsel noted Wifeâ€™s pension had not yet vested, the court \r\n  stated the pension could be divided by a Qualified Domestic Relations Order.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, during her testimony Wife said she believed Husband would be entitled \r\n  to a portion of her pension, and when the court mentioned her testimony later \r\n  during the hearing, Wifeâ€™s counsel accepted the courtâ€™s recollection.Â  Because \r\n  Wife never attempted to show her pension was non-marital, the court erred in \r\n  ruling the pension was non-marital.Â  We find Wifeâ€™s pension should be divided \r\n  by QDRO in the same proportions the judge indicated for equitable distribution.Â  \r\n  Therefore, we reverse and remand to the family court for the preparation and \r\n  execution of a QDRO dividing the pension in the following proportions:Â  39% \r\n  to Husband and 61% to Wife.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the family court erred in refusing to \r\n  divide the personal property and in excluding Wifeâ€™s pension from the apportionment.Â  \r\n  However, we find the court did not err in determining the amount Husband must \r\n  pay toward the marital debt or in allowing Wifeâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the decision of the family court is\r\n AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-240","title":"Thompson v.

Poliakoff, of Spartanburg; for Appellant.\r\nH. Brent Fortson, of Greenville; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Harry L. Richie brought suit \r\n  against James Brian Ingle, alleging damages resulting from an automobile collision.Â  \r\n  During trial, Richie moved for a directed verdict as to liability on the grounds \r\n  that it was admitted.Â  After noting Ingle admitted only negligence and asserted \r\n  the accident was not the proximate cause of Richieâ€™s injuries, the court denied \r\n  the motion.Â  The jury returned a verdict in favor of Ingle.Â  Richie moved for \r\n  a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a new trial absolute.Â  The trial \r\n  judge denied these motions.Â  On appeal, Richie challenges the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  failure to grant his directed verdict and new trial motions, as well as his \r\n  refusal to charge a requested jury instruction.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIngle testified he was involved in an \r\n  automobile collision with a third party, which resulted in Ingleâ€™s vehicle spinning \r\n  around, out of control.Â  His vehicle then came to rest touching Richieâ€™s vehicle, \r\n  which was at a complete stop at the time the cars made contact.Â  Ingle claimed \r\n  his car was â€œalmost at a dead restâ€ when it â€œbumped [Richieâ€™s car] at bestâ€ \r\n  and the vehicles ended up touching.Â  He did not recall a second impact, and \r\n  did not know the cars were even touching until he let out his clutch and his \r\n  and Richieâ€™s cars were jarred by this action.Â  Ingleâ€™s passenger testified, \r\n  when they came to a stop after the initial collision, Ingleâ€™s car was touching \r\n  the other car, but she did not feel being hit again.Â  \r\nThe repairs to Richieâ€™s car cost approximately \r\n  $1,500. [1] Â  Ingle testified \r\n  Richie indicated he was okay when he got out of the car following the accident, \r\n  and that he appeared to be okay.Â  Ingleâ€™s passenger confirmed that Richie appeared \r\n  to be fine after the accident.Â  \r\nRichie testified, following the accident, \r\n  he told the third party involved that he had back pain, but because this person \r\n  had an injured passenger, he told them to go ahead and let the ambulance take \r\n  her to the hospital.Â  Richie returned home that night and went straight to bed.Â  \r\n  Two days later, he attended a previously scheduled appointment with his chiropractor.Â  \r\n  Richie was subsequently diagnosed as having a herniated disk in the lumbar region \r\n  of his spine.Â  Dr. Awe, Richieâ€™s chiropractor, testified that in his opinion, \r\n  Richieâ€™s herniated disk was causally related to the automobile accident.Â  Dr. \r\n  Darwin Kellar, the neurosurgeon who performed surgery on Richieâ€™s herniated \r\n  disk, testified he had been given the impression the accident was â€œa near head-on \r\n  collisionâ€ with a â€œdirect blunt impact of a significant nature.â€Â  He stated \r\n  the pain Richie was experiencing could have been from an accident, and was not \r\n  necessarily caused by degenerative disk disease or degenerative joint disease.Â  \r\n  Dr. Darwin testified he found there was a causal relationship between the automobile \r\n  accident and Richieâ€™s injury.Â  He admitted, however, that any causal relationship \r\n  he found was attributed to the history given by Richie.Â  He further could not \r\n  say that the accident exacerbated Richieâ€™s degenerative joint disease.Â  \r\nAt trial, Richie introduced damages totaling \r\n  $39,402.06.Â  The suit was originally brought against both drivers involved in \r\n  the first accident, but Ingle admitted during the trial that he was at fault \r\n  in the first accident.Â  Ingleâ€™s counsel stipulated the third driver had no role \r\n  in the accident.Â  With consent from Richieâ€™s counsel, the other driver was dismissed \r\n  from the lawsuit.Â  \r\nAs the trial continued, the court and the parties \r\n  engaged in discussions regarding Ingleâ€™s negligence and liability.Â  Richieâ€™s \r\n  counsel moved for a directed verdict as to liability, primarily based upon the \r\n  fact that Ingle stipulated he was responsible for the first accident, and he \r\n  was thus liable for the impact with Richie.Â  The court questioned whether Ingle \r\n  was admitting liability, or only negligence.Â  After the discussions, the motion \r\n  was denied.Â  \r\nDuring the conference on the jury charge, \r\n  Richie requested a particular charge regarding preexisting conditions.Â  The \r\n  court found the instruction was encompassed by the general charge being given, \r\n  and declined to give the specific charge.Â  Following the jury instruction, Richie \r\n  took exception to the courtâ€™s failure to give the charge as requested.Â  \r\nThe jury subsequently returned a verdict in favor \r\n  of the defendant, Ingle.Â  In his post-trial motions Richie argued he was entitled \r\n  to judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial under the thirteenth \r\n  juror doctrine.Â  The trial judge denied the motions after he noted that, while \r\n  negligence was admitted, proximate cause and damages were contested, and the \r\n  degree of impact and alleged resulting damages were â€œhotly disputed.â€Â  Although \r\n  he observed that his view of the evidence as to these contested issues may differ \r\n  from that of the jury, he still declined to invoke the thirteenth juror doctrine.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Directed Verdict\r\nRichie contends the trial court erred \r\n  in failing to grant his motion for a directed verdict as to the liability of \r\n  Ingle, arguing Ingle accepted liability for the accident and the jury should \r\n  have been so instructed.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen reviewing the denial of a motion for directed \r\n  verdict, the appellate court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences \r\n  therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Wintersteen \r\n  v. Food Lion, Inc., 344 S.C. 32, 35, 542 S.E.2d 728, 729 (2001).Â  â€œIf the \r\n  evidence as a whole is susceptible of only one reasonable inference, no jury \r\n  issue is created and a directed verdict motion is properly granted.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n  However, as long as the evidence is susceptible to more than one reasonable \r\n  inference, the motion should be denied and the case should be submitted to the \r\n  jury.Â  Harvey v. Strickland, 350 S.C. 303, 309, 566 S.E.2d 529, 532 (2002).\r\nSeveral times during trial, Ingleâ€™s attorney \r\n  discussed his clientâ€™s fault in regard to the accident.Â  During his opening \r\n  statement, Ingleâ€™s attorney stated:Â  â€œWe admit fault in this case.Â  Thatâ€™s not \r\n  why we are here.â€Â  He further stated:Â  â€œ[I]tâ€™s our fault.Â  We agree with that. \r\n  . . . Weâ€™re just here to really look at this, apply good old-fashioned sense \r\n  to what is really wrong with Mr. Harry Richie that could have been caused by \r\n  this kind of impact.â€Â  \r\nLater, during examination of Ingle by \r\n  Richieâ€™s attorney, Ingleâ€™s attorney interrupted to admit the third-party was \r\n  not at all responsible for the damages stating: â€œWeâ€™re not contending that we \r\n  were not at fault.â€Â  He then stipulated that the third driver was not responsible \r\n  for the accident between Ingle and Richie.&nbsp; \r\nThe main conversation on the issue came \r\n  after Richie made a motion for directed verdict as to liability.Â  The following \r\n  colloquy took place between Ingleâ€™s attorney and the court:\r\n\r\nCounsel:Â Â Â Â  And I donâ€™t know that - - we admit liability.Â  \r\n  I think we just need to make a comment to them.Â  I think they clearly understand \r\n  that itâ€™s an admitted case as to the liability on the part of this particular \r\n  defendant.\r\nCourt:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Okay.Â  I didnâ€™t understand that earlier.Â  Thatâ€™s \r\n  - - and I apologize.Â  That was my fault.Â  I didnâ€™t know you admitted liability.\r\nCounsel: Â Â Â  Okay.\r\nCourt:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  So Iâ€™ll just do one option for the Plaintiff \r\n  and instruct the jury they have to return some reward of money damages for the \r\n  Plaintiff.\r\nCounsel:Â Â Â Â  If itâ€™s related. Â I guess they could find for \r\n  the Defendant.\r\nCourt:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Weâ€™re back where we were.Â  You say you admit \r\n  liability.Â  You admit negligence or you admit liability?Â  Thereâ€™s a difference \r\n  between night and day.\r\nCounsel:Â Â Â Â  . . . We were negligent.Â  We deny liability for \r\n  damages and that kind of thing under the issue of damages in this case.Â  We \r\n  admit we were negligent and our party caused the accident.\r\nCourt:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  You told me just a minute ago that you admitted \r\n  liability.\r\nCounsel:Â Â Â Â  I misstated.\r\nCourt:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Okay.Â  You meant to say you admitted negligence?\r\nCounsel:Â Â Â Â  Yes.\r\nCourt:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  And liability is in dispute? . . .\r\nCounsel:Â Â Â Â  Right.\r\nCourt:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . You dispute proximate cause and damages?\r\nCounsel:Â Â Â Â  That is correct.\r\n\r\n*Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  *Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  *\r\n\r\nCounsel:Â Â Â Â  Okay.Â  Judge, we believe, you know, that we were \r\n  negligent.Â  He just does not want to accept full liability for everything, that \r\n  he was negligent, accepts his part in causing the negligent act and that kind \r\n  of thing - -\r\nCourt:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . He admits\r\nnegligence?\r\nCounsel:Â Â Â Â  Yes.\r\nCourt:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The challenge is proximate cause and damages.\r\nCounsel:Â Â Â Â  Correct.Â \r\n\r\nFinally, during closing arguments, Ingleâ€™s counsel \r\n  again stated that Ingle â€œadmitted heâ€™s liable.â€Â  \r\nâ€œIn order to establish a claim for negligence, \r\n  a plaintiff must prove the following elements:Â  1) a duty of care owed by the \r\n  defendant to the plaintiff, 2) a breach of that duty by negligent act or omission, \r\n  and 3) damage proximately caused by the breach.â€Â  Huggins v. Citibank, N.A., \r\n  355 S.C. 329, 332, 585 S.E.2d 275, 276 (2003).Â  Ingle clearly admitted he owed \r\n  a duty to Richie and his negligent actions breached that duty.Â  However, Ingleâ€™s \r\n  counsel indicated that his use of the word â€œliabilityâ€ was a misstatement, and \r\n  clarified that they challenged proximate cause and damages in this case.Â  Additionally, \r\n  there was sufficient evidence from which an inference could be drawn that the \r\n  damages claimed were not proximately caused by the impact between the partiesâ€™ \r\n  cars.\r\nIn spite of the misstatements made by \r\n  Ingleâ€™s counsel indicating Ingle admitted liability for the accident, the jury \r\n  had before it evidence from which it could find that Richieâ€™s damages were not \r\n  proximately caused by the impact between their cars, and thus return a verdict \r\n  for Ingle.Â  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Ingle, an inference \r\n  could be drawn that he only admitted negligence, and proximate cause and damages \r\n  were still issues to be determined by the jury.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial \r\n  court properly denied the motion for a directed verdict as to liability.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Thirteenth Juror Doctrine\r\nRichie maintains the trial court erred \r\n  in failing to grant a new trial absolute under the thirteenth juror doctrine.Â  \r\n  He asserts the evidence does not justify a defense verdict in this case.Â  We \r\n  find no error.\r\nâ€œThe thirteenth juror doctrine is a vehicle \r\n  by which the trial court may grant a new trial absolute when he finds that the \r\n  evidence does not justify the verdict.Â  This ruling has also been termed granting \r\n  a new trial upon the facts.â€Â  Folkens v. Hunt, 300 S.C. 251, 254, 387 \r\n  S.E.2d 265, 267 (1990).Â  â€œA trial judgeâ€™s order granting or denying a new trial \r\n  upon the facts will not be disturbed unless his decision is wholly unsupported \r\n  by the evidence, or the conclusion reached was controlled by an error of law.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 254-255, 387 S.E.2d at 267.Â  In reviewing the denial of a motion \r\n  for a new trial under the thirteenth juror doctrine, the appellate court must \r\n  consider only whether there is any evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s decision.Â  \r\n  Haselden v. Davis, 341 S.C. 486, 506, 534 S.E.2d 295, 306 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\n  Thus, in order to reverse such a denial, the appellate court must find the moving \r\n  party was entitled to a directed verdict at trial.Â  Id.\r\nThe record in this case contains contested evidence \r\n  regarding the severity of the impact of the cars and the amount of damages resulting \r\n  from the impact.Â  Ingle testified that the contact between the cars was very \r\n  light, describing the cars as only touching and stating, â€œwe bumped at best.â€Â  \r\n  Ingle testified that the damage to his car was a â€œ[v]ery, very small dent,â€ \r\n  as depicted in a picture of the side of his car which came into contact with \r\n  Richieâ€™s.Â  The passenger in Ingleâ€™s vehicle testified that they came to a stop \r\n  after the first collision and she did not feel another impact, but discoveredÂ  \r\n  Ingleâ€™s car was touching Richieâ€™s car when they attempted to exit the vehicle.Â  \r\n  Richie, on the other hand, testified the photograph of Ingleâ€™s car was not an \r\n  accurate depiction of how his car appeared immediately after the collision.Â  \r\n  He stated that it looked as if the sheet metal on the door panel of Ingleâ€™s \r\n  car had popped back out, while it appeared to be pushed in approximately six \r\n  inches right after the accident.Â  \r\nAdditionally, the medical testimony conflicted.Â  \r\n  Ingle and his passenger both testified that Richie seemed unhurt after the impact \r\n  and that he was able to move around fine.Â  After the impact, Richie allowed \r\n  a passenger in the first accident to be taken by ambulance.Â  Instead of seeking \r\n  immediate medical attention, Richie went home for the evening and did not seek \r\n  any treatment for injuries until two days later when he saw his chiropractor \r\n  during a previously scheduled appointment.Â  \r\nFurther, Richieâ€™s neurosurgeon, Dr. Keller, testified \r\n  that Richie suffered from degenerative disk disease or degenerative joint disease.Â  \r\n  He stated there could be a causal connection between the accident and the herniated \r\n  disk, but admitted his diagnosis of a connection was based upon the history \r\n  presented by Richie.Â  He also stated Richie had described the accident to him \r\n  â€œas something of a near head-on collisionâ€ and he got the impression that it \r\n  was a â€œpretty direct blunt impact of a significant nature.â€Â  Additionally, Dr. \r\n  Keller admitted he could not say whether or not the wreck exacerbated the preexisting \r\n  degenerative joint disease.Â  \r\nThe record contains contradictory evidence regarding \r\n  the severity of the impact between Ingleâ€™s and Richieâ€™s vehicles, as well as \r\n  medical testimony which contains some uncertainty regarding the cause of his \r\n  herniated disk.Â  Based upon our limited standard of review, we cannot say the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s decision is wholly unsupported by the evidence, or the conclusion \r\n  reached was controlled by an error of law.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court \r\n  did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial under the \r\n  thirteenth juror doctrine.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Jury Charge\r\nRichie asserts the trial court erred in \r\n  refusing to charge the jury with his requested charge regarding his preexisting \r\n  condition.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe circuit court must charge the current and correct \r\n  law to the jury.Â  McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. 301, 306, 457 S.E.2d \r\n  603, 606 (1995).Â  When reviewing jury charges for error, an appellate court \r\n  must consider the courtâ€™s charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues \r\n  presented at trial.Â  Keaton ex rel. Foster v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., \r\n  334 S.C. 488, 497, 514 S.E.2d 570, 575 (1999).Â  A jury charge is correct if, \r\n  when read as a whole, it contains the correct definition and adequately charges \r\n  the law.Â  Id. at 495-96, 514 S.E.2d at 574.Â  It is the substance of the \r\n  law that must be instructed to the jury, not any particular verbiage.Â  Id. \r\n  at 496, 514 S.E.2d at 574.Â  Further, refusal to give a properly requested charge \r\n  is not error if the general instructions are sufficiently broad to enable the \r\n  jury to understand the law and the issues involved.Â  McCourt, 318 S.C. \r\n  at 306, 457 S.E.2d at 606.\r\nRichie asked the court to instruct the \r\n  jury with the following language:\r\n\r\nThat Plaintiff has preexisting condition resulting in greater \r\n  susceptibility to injury would not diminish his entitlement to damages for personal \r\n  injuries.Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial court denied the specific request, \r\n  noting that the proposed instruction was covered by the courtâ€™s general charge.Â  \r\n  The trial courtâ€™s instruction given to the jury included the following relevant \r\n  instruction:\r\n\r\nI now want to charge you on a principle of law called preexisting \r\n  condition.Â  [An] injured person is entitled to recover full compensation for \r\n  all damages which proximately directly result from a defendantâ€™s negligent act \r\n  or omission.Â  This is so even if the personâ€™s injuries may have been aggravated \r\n  by reason of a preexisting condition.Â  A defendant cannot invoke a preexisting \r\n  condition of the person injured for the purpose of escaping the consequences \r\n  of his own negligence or reducing the damages for which he is liable.\r\nIf a plaintiff is suffering from a preexisting condition \r\n  and the preexisting condition is aggravated by injuries sustained in a subsequent \r\n  accident for which you find the plaintiff should be compensated, the plaintiff \r\n  would be entitled to be compensated for the aggravation of the preexisting injury \r\n  or condition as well as any new or additional injuries sustained in the subsequent \r\n  accident.Â  Provided, of course, such aggravation or new injury is the natural \r\n  and proximate result of the negligence of the defendant.\r\n\r\nThe circuit courtâ€™s charge contained the current \r\n  and correct law. When considered as a whole, the general instructions contained \r\n  the correct definitions and adequately charged the substance of the law.Â  Refusal \r\n  to give the instruction specifically requested was not error since the general \r\n  instructions were sufficiently broad to enable the jury to understand the law \r\n  and the issues involved.Â  Accordingly, we find no error in the charge as given \r\n  by the court or in its refusal to charge the specific language requested by \r\n  Richie.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court did not err in \r\n  denying Richieâ€™s motion for a directed verdict as to liability.Â  While Ingleâ€™s \r\n  attorney acknowledged he had admitted liability, he informed the court that \r\n  was a misstatement, and he clearly indicated Ingle contested proximate cause \r\n  and damages and admitted only negligence.Â  Because the evidence was susceptible \r\n  to more than one reasonable inference, the motion was properly denied.Â  We further \r\n  hold there was conflicting evidence in the record such that the trial court \r\n  did not err in refusing to grant a new trial pursuant to the thirteenth juror \r\n  doctrine.Â  Finally, while the jury charge did not use the specific language \r\n  requested by Richie, the charge, considered as a whole, was sufficiently broad \r\n  to enable the jury to understand the law and the issues involved.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the decisions of the trial court are \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, STILWELL, and CURETON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    In his complaint, Richie sought compensation for damages related to his physical \r\n    injuries, but not for damages to his automobile.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-242","title":"State v.

Milling, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-242\r\nSubmitted October 15, 2003 â€“ Filed April \r\n  15, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nEdward Littles, Jr., pro se Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy \r\n  Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney \r\n  General Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General Melody J. \r\n  Brown, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Jay E. Hodge, Jr., of Darlington,\r\nfor Respondent. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Littles was \r\n  indicted for murder.Â  The case was called for trial on February 12, 2002.Â  After \r\n  jury selection, the judge adjourned court for the day.Â  Littles was allowed \r\n  to stay on bond, but the court informed Littles that failure to appear at the \r\n  trial would not delay the trial from moving forward.Â  On February 13, 2002, \r\n  Littles did not return to court.Â  On February 14, 2002, Littles returned for \r\n  the second day of trial.Â  The jury convicted him of murder.Â  The judge sentenced \r\n  Littles to 40 years imprisonment.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe victim, Harold \r\n  Richard Williams, owned a small store and poolroom in Bennettsville, South Carolina.Â  \r\n  On August 11, 1999, the victimâ€™s wife, Kathy Moody, went to the store to see \r\n  the victim and pick up supplies for a planned outing scheduled for the following \r\n  day.Â  When Ms. Moody arrived, a group of men were at the store, including Edward \r\n  Littles, Jr.Â  Some members of the group were playing pool; Mr. Littles was observing \r\n  them play.Â  \r\nAt some point later, \r\n  Littles, Maurice McNeil and a man named Shawn (whose last name was unknown) \r\n  were outside in the middle of the street. They were involved in an altercation.Â  \r\n  Littles approached McNeil and Shawn as they were crossing the street.Â  Littles \r\n  called to McNeil and stated â€œAll I asked you to do is buy me a beer.â€ Shawn \r\n  returned to where Littles and McNeil were talking and informed Littles that \r\n  he was trying to get home and did not want any trouble. Littles pointed his \r\n  gun at Shawn and told him that he was not speaking to him.Â  Shawn ran away, \r\n  while McNeil stood there.Â  Eventually, Littles and McNeil returned to the inside \r\n  of the store so that McNeil could return a paged call.Â  \r\nOnce McNeil and Littles were \r\n  inside the store, McNeil used the telephone. When McNeil picked up the telephone \r\n  and started dialing, Littles came around to where the phone was and pulled \r\n  McNeilâ€™s hand off the telephone and pulled McNeil away from the phone.Â  At that \r\n  point, McNeil and Littles began fighting.Â  Williams pulled out a gun and requested \r\n  Littles leave.Â  Littles got â€œcrazy, loudâ€ and said that he was not afraid of \r\n  the gun.Â  Williams picked up his gun and struck Littles on the forehead and \r\n  pushed him out the door.Â  As Williams was pushing Littles out the door \r\n  the clip fell from Williamsâ€™ gun.Â  \r\nLittles returned and threatened \r\n  to shoot Moody, then shot Williams.Â  After shooting Williams, Littles \r\n  went outside.Â  After Littles left, there were several shots outside.Â  Littles \r\n  returned to the store and fired several shots into Williams, who was on the \r\n  floor. Williams was pronounced dead at the scene.Â  Â \r\nThe case was called for trial \r\n  on February 12, 2002. Prior to the beginning of the trial, the judge allowed \r\n  Littles to remain on bond.Â  However, the judge admonished Littles that the trial \r\n  would proceed whether Littles was present.Â  Littles did not show for the second \r\n  day of trial and the trial proceeded and testimony was completed.Â  Littles returned \r\n  before closing arguments on the last day of trial.Â  He was convicted of murder \r\n  and sentenced to forty (40) years.Â  Littles appeals.\r\nISSUES \r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Did the trial court err in proceeding with the trial in abstentia?\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Did the trial court err in denying Appellantâ€™s motion for directed verdict on \r\n  the grounds of lack of evidence?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1. Trial In Abstentia\r\nLittles asserts the trial court erred in trying \r\n  him in absentia. We disagree.Â  \r\nRule 16 of the South Carolina Rules of Criminal \r\n  Procedure provides:Â  \r\n\r\nExcept in cases wherein capital \r\n  punishment is a permissible sentence, a person indicted for misdemeanors and/or \r\n  felonies may voluntarily waive his right to be present and may be tried in his \r\n  absence upon a finding by the court that such person has received notice of \r\n  his right to be present and that a warning was given that the trial would proceed \r\n  in his absence upon a failure to attend the court.Â Â  \r\n\r\nRule 16, SCRCrimP.Â  \r\nâ€œA trial judge must determine a criminal defendant \r\n  voluntarily waived his right to be present at trial in order to try the case \r\n  in absentia.â€Â  See Rule 16, SCRCrimP; State v. Castineira, \r\n  341 S.C. 619, 623, 535 S.E.2d 449, 451 (Ct.App. 2000)Â  â€œThe judge must make \r\n  findings of fact on the record that the defendant (1) received notice of his \r\n  right to be present; and (2) was warned he would be tried in his absence should \r\n  he fail to attend.â€ Castineira, 341 S.C. at 623, 535 S.E.2d 451; State \r\n  v. Jackson, 288 S.C. 94, 96, 341 S.E.2d 375 (1986).\r\nThe record establishes the trial judge made the \r\n  requisite inquiries and findings; and counsel stipulated that Littles received \r\n  the proper notice, not only from the court, but also from counsel himself. Therefore, \r\n  this issue is without merit.\r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Directed Verdict Motion\r\nAlthough Littles raises the denial of the directed \r\n  verdict motion in his statement of the issues on appeal, he failed to argue \r\n  it in his brief. â€œAn issue raised on appeal but not argued in the brief is deemed \r\n  abandoned and will not be considered by the appellate court.â€Â  Fields v. \r\n  Melrose Ltd. Partnership, 312 S.C. 102, 106, 439 S.E.2d 283, 285 (Ct.App. \r\n  1993).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  ruling is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-243","title":"State v.

Michael Baxley, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-247\r\nHeard March 11, 2004 â€“ Filed April 15, \r\n  2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nMarcus A. Manos and J. David Black, both of Columbia, and \r\n  Thomas H. Pope, III, of Newberry, for Appellant.Â  \r\nMark W. Buyck, Jr., and Mark W. Buyck, III, both of Florence, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Carolina Power &amp; Light \r\n  brought this declaratory judgment action against Lynches River Electric Cooperative \r\n  seeking a declaration of rights regarding the provision of electric service \r\n  to a Bi-Lo supermarket in the Town of Pageland.Â  Lynches River appeals the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to CP&amp;L.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nSince 1925, CP&amp;L and its predecessor \r\n  have provided electric service to the residents of the Town of Pageland.Â  Lynches \r\n  River began offering electric service in 1939.Â  In 1949, the Town of Pageland \r\n  extended its one-half mile radius boundary by annexing land within a radius \r\n  of one mile from the center of town.Â  The newly annexed area included electric \r\n  utility lines owned by both CP&amp;L and Lynches River.Â  CP&amp;L, however, \r\n  has always been the principal supplier of electricity to the town.Â  \r\nIn May of 1981, the town granted CP&amp;L \r\n  an indeterminate permit to provide electric service to the residents.Â  Since \r\n  at least 1990, Lynches River has provided electric service to tenants in a strip \r\n  mall, including Bi-Lo.Â  The structure was located outside the original town \r\n  boundary, but inside the annexed area.Â  Lynches River has also provided electric \r\n  service to the parking lot adjacent to the structure.Â  CP&amp;L has not challenged \r\n  Lynches Riverâ€™s right to continue service to the strip mall.Â  \r\nIn 2001, Bi-Lo began construction on a \r\n  new store located across the parking lot from the existing structure.Â  The new \r\n  structure is located entirely within the original town limits.Â  The same developer \r\n  owns the property upon which both structures are located.Â  \r\nLynches River and Bi-Lo entered into a contract \r\n  for electrical service on the new building.Â  Lynches River offered electrical \r\n  service to the new structure through a distribution point near the existing \r\n  structureâ€™s distribution point.Â  The distribution points are within the annexed \r\n  area of the town and not within the original boundary.Â  \r\nCP&amp;L, upon learning that Lynches River was \r\n  providing the electrical service to the new structure, filed this claim for \r\n  a declaratory judgment.Â  CP&amp;L filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming \r\n  Lynches River could not serve electricity in the original town boundaries because \r\n  it is not a rural area and Lynches River failed to meet any of the exceptions \r\n  allowing it to provide electrical service inside the town.Â  CP&amp;L presented \r\n  the figure from the 2000 United States Census showing the population was 2,521.Â  \r\n\r\nLynches River filed its own motion for \r\n  summary judgment, asserting the population was below 2,500 and it could continue \r\n  service to the new structure because it served the existing structure.Â  Lynches \r\n  River presented an affidavit by the mayor of the Town of Pageland, which stated \r\n  it was the mayorâ€™s belief that the population had dropped below 2,500.Â  \r\nThe trial court determined the mayorâ€™s \r\n  affidavit was insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to \r\n  the population of the town, and that Lynches River did not meet any of the exceptions \r\n  of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-49-250 (1990) which would allow it to provide electrical \r\n  service to the new structure.Â  The trial court distinguished the case of Carolina \r\n  Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Bennettsville, 314 S.C. 137, 442 S.E.2d \r\n  177 (1994), finding the point of delivery to the new structure is not in a rural \r\n  area, but within the town limits.Â  Accordingly, the trial court granted summary \r\n  judgment to CP&amp;L.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, \r\n  this court applies the same standard which governs the trial court:Â  summary \r\n  judgment is proper when â€œthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and \r\n  . . . the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), \r\n  SCRCP; Baughman v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 114-15, \r\n  410 S.E.2d 537, 545 (1991).Â  â€œIn determining whether any triable issues of fact \r\n  exist, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the \r\n  evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.â€Â  \r\n  Strother&nbsp;v. Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, 61, \r\n  504 S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998).Â  â€œOn appeal from an order granting summary judgment, \r\n  the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences \r\n  arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non&#8209;moving \r\n  party below.â€Â  Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Rural Electric Cooperative Act (RECA) permits \r\n  the formation of nonprofit cooperatives â€œfor the purpose of supplying electric \r\n  energy and promoting and extending the use thereof in rural areas.â€Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§&nbsp;33-49-210 (1990). [1] Â  As creatures of statute, rural \r\n  electric cooperatives â€œonly have such authority as the legislature has given \r\n  them.â€Â  Duke Power Co. v. Laurens Elec. Co-op., Inc., 344 S.C. 101, 104, \r\n  543 S.E.2d 560, 562 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  They may only serve rural areas, that \r\n  is, areas where the population is less than 2,500 persons.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  33-49-250(1) (1990).Â  RECA permits a cooperative to serve non-rural areas under \r\n  two exceptions:Â  (1) the cooperative may continue to provide electrical service \r\n  to a town in which it is the principal electrical provider, and (2) the cooperative \r\n  may continue to serve premises it served at the time the area was annexed into \r\n  the town, and until directed otherwise by the local governing body, it may serve \r\n  other premises within the same area.Â  Id.\r\nâ€œBoth exceptions prevent the ouster of co-ops from \r\n  areas they have historically served due to population growth or annexation.â€Â  \r\n  Duke Power, 344 S.C. at 105, 543 S.E.2d at 562.Â  The statutory language, \r\n  therefore, â€œcontemplate[s] [a] co-opâ€™s continued serviceâ€ in an area to which \r\n  an exception applies.Â  Id.\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Affidavit Regarding Population of the Town of Pageland\r\nLynches River asserts the trial court \r\n  improperly attributed no weight to the affidavit of Pagelandâ€™s mayor, Carroll \r\n  Faile, in regards to the townâ€™s population.Â  Lynches River argues the affidavit \r\n  is sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Lynches \r\n  River has the right to provide electric service because the population has fallen \r\n  below 2,500 people.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nRule 56(e), SCRCP, states:Â  â€œSupporting \r\n  and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth \r\n  such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively \r\n  that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.â€Â  Neither \r\n  the trial court nor this court are â€œrequired to single out some one morsel of \r\n  evidence and attach to it great significance when patently the evidence is introduced \r\n  solely in a vain attempt to create an issue of fact that is not genuine.â€Â  Main \r\n  v. Corley, 281 S.C. 525, 527, 316 S.E.2d 406, 407 (1984).Â  \r\nIn his affidavit, the mayor identified himself \r\n  as the townâ€™s mayor and a resident of the county, asserted he was familiar with \r\n  the townâ€™s economic conditions and its population trends over the last twenty \r\n  years, and stated that given the recent economic downturn and the downward population \r\n  downtrend, he believed and opined that the townâ€™s population was on the decrease \r\n  and had fallen below 2,500.Â  \r\nIn Englert, Inc. v. Netherlands Ins. \r\n  Co., this court determined an affiantâ€™s status as the vice-president of \r\n  the company was insufficient to demonstrate he had personal knowledge of the \r\n  contract and job performed in that case.Â  Englert, 315 S.C. 300, 304, \r\n  433 S.E.2d 871, 874 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  As in Englert, the mayorâ€™s affidavit \r\n  fails to provide sufficient admissible evidence to support his belief.Â  Although \r\n  the mayor states he is familiar with the situation in Pageland, his affidavit \r\n  is not based on personal knowledge, but is only an opinion based on his belief \r\n  that the townâ€™s population had decreased.Â  The mayor did not, and obviously \r\n  could not, state he knew the exact population of the town.Â  Accordingly, the \r\n  trial court correctly refused to give this â€œmorselâ€ of information such significance \r\n  as to create a genuine issue of fact regarding the townâ€™s population. \r\nBecause the only properly admitted evidence regarding \r\n  the townâ€™s populationâ€”the 2000 United States Censusâ€”established the population \r\n  was 2,521, Lynches River can only service areas within the town if it falls \r\n  under one of the exceptions mentioned above and discussed below. \r\nII.Â Â Â Â  Other Exceptions \r\nLynches River has not contended it is \r\n  the principal supplier of electricity in the Town of Pageland and is thus not \r\n  entitled to provide service inside the town under that exception.\r\nThe only other exception that could apply \r\n  is the annexation exception that would allow Lynches River to continue servicing \r\n  premises being served at the time of the annexation of an area into the town \r\n  or additional premises within the annexed area until the town directs otherwise.Â  \r\n\r\nLynches River contends the existing structure \r\n  and the new structure occupy a single premises because they sit on a single \r\n  tract owned by the same developer.Â  Although the statute permits the cooperative \r\n  to service all premises it served prior to the annexation and all premises in \r\n  that area until instructed otherwise, it specifically states the cooperative \r\n  â€œshall not extend service to any premises in any other part of such city or \r\n  townâ€ where, as here, it is not the townâ€™s principal electrical provider.Â  See \r\n  Â§ 33-49-250(1).Â  Here, the new structure is entirely within the original town \r\n  limits, an area in which Lynches River has no right to provide service.\r\nAlthough not directly applicable to the \r\n  definition of â€œpremisesâ€ in section 33-49-250, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-27-610 (1976) \r\n  defines the term for purpose of that article, which involves the service rights \r\n  of electric suppliers:\r\n\r\n(2) The term â€œpremisesâ€ means the building, structure \r\n  or facility to which electricity is being or is to be furnished; provided, \r\n  that two or more buildings, structures or facilities which are located on one \r\n  tract or contiguous tracts of land and are utilized by one electric consumer \r\n  for farming, business, commercial, industrial, institutional or governmental \r\n  purposes, shall together constitute one â€œpremises,â€ except that any such \r\n  building, structure or facility shall not, together with any other building, \r\n  structure or facility, constitute one â€œpremisesâ€ if the electric service to \r\n  it is separately metered and the charges for such service are calculated independently \r\n  of charges for service to any other building, structure or facility.\r\n\r\n(Final emphasis added.)\r\nIn the instant case, the existing structure \r\n  and the new structure are located on one tract of land.Â  However, they will \r\n  be separately metered and the calculation of the electricity consumed by and \r\n  billed for the existing structure will be separate from that consumed by and \r\n  billed for the new structure.Â  As such, they are considered two separate premises \r\n  even though they are situated on the same tract of land. Accordingly, the trial \r\n  court correctly concluded Lynches River may not provide service to the new structure.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Carolina Power &amp; Light v. City of Bennettsville\r\nLynches River argues the holding in Carolina \r\n  Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Bennettsville, 314 S.C. 137, 442 S.E.2d \r\n  177 (1994), applies to its situation because the point of distribution to the \r\n  new structure lies in the annexed area and outside the original town limits.Â  \r\n  In Bennettsville the court held a cooperative could provide service that \r\n  was distributed to a point in a rural area even though it was ultimately consumed \r\n  within the city limits.Â  Id. at 139-40, 442 S.E.2d at 179.\r\nIn this case, the distribution point is a new distribution \r\n  point located in an annexed area of the Town of Pageland, not a rural area as \r\n  in Bennettsville.Â  Even though the distribution point in this case is \r\n  in the annexed area, where Lynches River has the right to continue to provide \r\n  service to existing premises, there was a new connection created which \r\n  was not authorized by statute.Â  Accordingly, the Bennettsville \r\n  case is not controlling and the trial court correctly declined to rely upon \r\n  its holding.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Sections 33-49-210 and 33-49-250 have been recently amended \r\n    by Act No. 179, 2004 S.C.

Caldwell, Jr., Family Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No, 2004-UP-248\r\nSubmitted March 8, 2004 â€“ Filed March \r\n  15, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJerry D. Vinson, Jr. and Michele R. Krize, both of Florence, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nJames M. Saleeby, Sr., of Florence, and Marian Dawn Nettles, \r\n  of Lake City, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Larry Foster (â€œHusbandâ€) brought \r\n  this action against his former wife Bettie Foster (â€œWifeâ€) seeking a termination \r\n  or reduction in alimony based on his substantial change of circumstances.Â  The \r\n  family court reduced Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation, but only based on Wifeâ€™s \r\n  change of income.Â  Wife appeals, alleging the trial court erred in modifying \r\n  the alimony and in failing to award her the full amount of her attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife married on April 17, \r\n  1985 and divorced on April 30, 1998.Â  The divorce decree divided the marital \r\n  estate equally between the parties and granted Wife $1,500 per month in permanent, \r\n  periodic alimony.Â  Wife appealed.Â  The parties settled the case during the pendency \r\n  of the appeal with an agreement approved by the family court.Â  This agreement \r\n  provided Husband would pay Wife $7,500 per month, consisting of $6,000 per month \r\n  in equitable distribution payments and $1,500 per month in permanent, periodic \r\n  alimony payments until the last equitable distribution payment was made in January \r\n  of 2002.Â  After the Husbandâ€™s equitable distribution payment obligations ceased, \r\n  Husbandâ€™s alimony obligations would increase to $4,000 per month.Â  The agreement \r\n  further provided that at that time, either party could move for a modification \r\n  of alimony based on a substantial change of circumstances.Â  \r\nIn February 2002, Husband filed this action \r\n  seeking a reduction or elimination of alimony based on a substantial change \r\n  of circumstances.Â  He alleged his businessesâ€™ incomes had decreased substantially \r\n  causing similar decreases in his personal income.Â  In addition to the Husbandâ€™s \r\n  alleged decrease in income, the family court also considered the wifeâ€™s new \r\n  employment with a bank in which she earned $1,387.00 per month.Â  \r\nThe family court reduced Husbandâ€™s alimony \r\n  obligation by $1,000 per month, basing the modification solely on Wifeâ€™s new \r\n  employment, and not Husbandâ€™s alleged loss of business income.Â  The court awarded \r\n  the Wife $2,500.00 of the attorneyâ€™s fees she requested.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.Â  Reduction in alimony\r\n\r\nWife argues the family court erred in finding \r\n  there had been a substantial change in her circumstances that warrant a reduction \r\n  in alimony.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe family court has the authority to alter alimony \r\n  payments upon a proper showing of a change of condition.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-170 \r\n  (1985).Â  Questions concerning alimony are in the sound discretion of the family \r\n  court.Â  Bryson v. Bryson, 347 S.C. 221, 224, 553 S.E.2d 493, 495 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001).Â  The family courtâ€™s modification of an alimony award will not be \r\n  reversed on appeal absent a showing of abuse of discretion.Â  Thornton v. \r\n  Thornton, 328 S.C. 96, 111, 492 S.E.2d 86, 94 (1997).Â  To justify modification \r\n  of an alimony award, the changes in circumstances must be substantial or material.Â  \r\n  Sharps v. Sharps, 342 S.C. 71, 76, 535 S.E.2d 913, 916 (2000).Â  â€œGenerally, \r\n  changes in circumstances within the contemplation of the parties at the time \r\n  the decree was entered do not provide a basis for modifying either an alimony \r\n  allowance or a child support award.â€Â  Id. (quoting Calvert v. Calvert, \r\n  287 S.C. 130, 139, 336 S.E.2d 884, 889 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  Therefore, courts have \r\n  refused to modify alimony where the parties anticipated the substantial change \r\n  in circumstances at the time of the divorce decree.Â  Sharps, 342 S.C. \r\n  at 76, 535 S.E.2d at 916. Â The original divorce decree generally addresses the \r\n  expected change of circumstances.Â  Id. at 76-77, 535 S.E.2d at\r\n916.&nbsp; \r\n\r\nThe family court reduced Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation \r\n  from $4,000 per month to $3,000 per month.Â  The court stated, â€œThe only reason \r\n  he is receiving the decrease herein awarded is the Wife managed to land a job \r\n  immediately before the hearing, candidly disclosed that fact, and allowed that \r\n  to be considered by the court.â€Â  Wife contends that the fact she now earns a \r\n  $1,387 per month income is not a sufficient change of circumstances to warrant \r\n  modification of the alimony award.Â  She argues the parties clearly anticipated \r\n  she would return to the work force, and therefore, it was error for the family \r\n  court to modify the alimony award.Â  \r\nWe find Wifeâ€™s new employment was a change of \r\n  circumstances that was unanticipated by the parties at the time of the decree.Â  \r\n  The original decree stated Wife had â€œjob skills as evidenced by her past work \r\n  history, however, she has been out of the job market for a number of years.â€Â  \r\n  We do not find this as an expression of the courtâ€™s anticipation of Wifeâ€™s future \r\n  employment.Â  Instead, we find the court was contemplating the difficulty Wife \r\n  might face trying to find employment because of her long absence from the job \r\n  market.Â  We also find no indication the parties anticipated Wifeâ€™s re-entry \r\n  into the workforce at the time they entered into the settlement agreement.Â  \r\n  In fact, except for some part-time employment, the Wife remained unemployed \r\n  from the time of the decree until the day before the hearing.\r\nWife also argues the reduction in alimony would not allow her to \r\n  maintain the standard of living she enjoyed during the marriage.Â  We find no \r\n  error in the family court reducing the alimony award to $3,000 a month when \r\n  Wife is now also earning $1,387 a month and listed the property she owns as \r\n  valued at $340,623.Â  In addition, Wife asserts the reduction in alimony penalizes \r\n  her for gaining employment.Â  We find this assertion meritless.Â  An alimony award \r\n  should not serve as a disincentive for a spouse to make reasonable efforts to \r\n  improve her employment potential or to dissuade the spouse from providing, to \r\n  the extent possible, for her own support.Â  Brandi v. Brandi, 302 S.C. \r\n  353, 358, 396 S.E.2d 124, 127 (Ct. App. 1990).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nBeing mindful of our standard of review, which gives the family court judge \r\n  discretion in modifying alimony, we find Wifeâ€™s new employment and income is \r\n  a sufficient change of circumstances to warrant the modification of the alimony \r\n  award from $4,000 to $3,000 per month.Â  \r\n\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attorneyâ€™s FeesÂ  \r\n\r\nWife argues the family court erred by only awarding her a portion of her attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees and costs.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs is in the \r\n  discretion of the family court and will not be overturned absent an abuse of \r\n  discretion.Â  Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 365, 384 S.E.2d 741, 748 \r\n  (1989).Â  To prevail on appeal, a party must show the courtâ€™s conclusions were \r\n  without factual support, resulted in prejudice, and amounted to an error of \r\n  law.Â  Alliegro v. Alliegro, 287 S.C. 154, 157, 337 S.E.2d 252, 254 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1985).Â  \r\nIn determining the proper amount to award, we \r\n  consider: the nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered; the time \r\n  necessarily devoted to the case; the professional standing of counsel; the contingency \r\n  of compensation; the beneficial results obtained; and the customary legal fees \r\n  for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 \r\n  S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).Â  \r\nWe recognize Wifeâ€™s attorney spent a considerable \r\n  amount of time deciphering Husbandâ€™s confusing business records in defending \r\n  the Husbandâ€™s claim for a reduction of alimony.Â  However, Wife is capable of \r\n  paying her own fees.Â  Her gross monthly income, including the reduced alimony, \r\n  is $4,387 and she owns $340,623 in total property according to her financial \r\n  declaration.Â  Furthermore, as to the beneficial results obtained, although the \r\n  family court rejected Husbandâ€™s contention that alimony should be reduced due \r\n  to his decrease in income, it nevertheless granted his request for a reduction \r\n  based on Wifeâ€™s new employment.Â  Therefore, Husband was successful in his claim \r\n  for a reduction in alimony.Â  Based on the above, we find the family court did \r\n  not abuse its discretion in awarding Wife $2,500.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees and costs. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONÂ  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the \r\n  family court is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n HUFF, STILWELL, and CURETON, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-249","title":"State v.

Richardson, \r\n  Assistant Attorney General Deborah R. J. Shupe, all of Columbia;Â  and Solicitor \r\n  Cecil Kelly Jackson, of Sumter; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â  Arthur Tyrone Davis \r\n  was convicted of two counts of assault and battery of a high and aggravated \r\n  nature (â€œABHANâ€), one count of possession of a weapon during a violent crime, \r\n  and one count of conspiracy.Â  The circuit court sentenced Davis to ten years \r\n  imprisonment for each count of ABHAN, five years imprisonment for possession \r\n  of a weapon during a violent crime, and five years imprisonment for conspiracy, \r\n  with the sentences to run consecutively.Â  Davis appeals, arguing the circuit \r\n  court erred by: 1) admitting the confession he gave as a part of the plea agreement; \r\n  and 2) refusing to enforce his plea agreement.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn April 14, 1997, assailants forced two men into \r\n  the trunk of their car.Â  The victims were driven to a secluded location where \r\n  they were robbed, beaten, stripped, and shot. \r\nSubsequently, Davis was brought to the police station for \r\n  questioning. After arriving at the police station, Officer James Hicks advised \r\n  Davis of his Miranda rights.Â  Because Davis chose not to waive these \r\n  rights, Officer Hicks did not question Davis at that time.Â  Instead, Officer \r\n  Hicks assisted Davis in calling his attorney, Murrell Smith. [1]  Davis and his attorney spoke \r\n  privately for approximately twenty minutes. Smith then proposed a deal to Officer \r\n  Hicks in which Davis would agree to tell the Solicitor about every crime he \r\n  had been involved in, and in exchange, the Solicitor would agree to allow Davis \r\n  to plead guilty to all offenses delineated as non-violent and receive a ten-year \r\n  cap on sentencing.Â  Officer Hicks spoke with a Sumter County Assistant Solicitor \r\n  and obtained approval to accept the offer.Â  Davis then gave a written confession \r\n  in which he admitted abducting and shooting the victims.Â  Thereafter, the Solicitor \r\n  refused to honor the agreement after learning Davis was involved in several \r\n  crimes he had not disclosed pursuant to the plea agreement. \r\nAt a pre-trial hearing, Davis moved to enforce \r\n  the terms of the plea agreement, denying the Solicitorâ€™s allegation that he \r\n  had been involved in crimes he had not disclosed pursuant to the agreement.Â  \r\n  The Solicitor presented testimony and evidence tying Davis to the additional \r\n  crimes.Â  Specifically, the Solicitor examined a police officer who testified \r\n  that he had learned of numerous crimes Davis did not report to the Solicitor. \r\n  The officer also testified he had interviewed a co-defendant concerning Davisâ€™ \r\n  involvement in crimes not disclosed to the Solicitor and had located documents \r\n  verifying Davis pawned stolen goods from those crimes.Â  The circuit court found \r\n  Davis breached the plea agreement and denied Davisâ€™ motion to enforce it. \r\nAt the call of the case for trial, Davis \r\n  moved to suppress the confession he had made to police in connection with the \r\n  failed plea agreement, arguing it could no longer be considered voluntary.Â  \r\n  Davis testified in the suppression hearing that his confession was made in reliance \r\n  on the plea agreement and that he would not otherwise have given such a statement.Â  \r\n  Davis argued that because the Solicitor chose not to honor the terms of the \r\n  plea agreement, the circuit court should find his confession was involuntarily \r\n  given.Â  The circuit court denied the motion to suppress Davisâ€™ confession, finding \r\n  it was voluntarily given.Â  \r\nAt trial, the Solicitor introduced the confession \r\n  over Davisâ€™ objection.Â  The jury subsequently returned a guilty verdict for \r\n  two counts of ABHAN, one count of possession of a weapon during a violent crime, \r\n  and one count of conspiracy.Â  The circuit court sentenced Davis to ten years \r\n  imprisonment for each count of ABHAN, five years imprisonment for possession \r\n  of a weapon during a violent crime, and five years imprisonment for conspiracy, \r\n  with the sentences to run consecutively.Â  Davis appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Admission of Confession\r\nDavis argues the circuit court erred by admitting \r\n  Davisâ€™ confession into evidence because the statement was not voluntarily given. \r\n  [2] Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn determining whether a confession was voluntarily \r\n  given by the defendant, the circuit court examines the totality of the circumstances \r\n  at the time the defendant gave the statement to determine if the conduct of \r\n  â€œlaw enforcement officials was such as to overbear [the defendantâ€™s] will to \r\n  resist and bring about confessions not freely self-determined.â€ Rogers v. \r\n  Richmond, 365 U.S. 534, 544 (1961); see State v. Peake, 291 \r\n  S.C. 138, 139, 352 S.E.2d 487, 488 (1987) (â€œThe test for determining the admissibility \r\n  of a statement is whether it was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily given \r\n  under the totality of the circumstances.â€).\r\nInitially, we note, Davis alleges because the plea \r\n  agreement induced him to confess, his statement became involuntary once the \r\n  Solicitor decided not to honor the plea agreement.Â  Because the totality of \r\n  the circumstances is considered to determine if the defendantâ€™s will is overborne \r\n  by the acts of the police at the time the confession is given, it would be inappropriate \r\n  to review the circumstances existing after the confession was given.Â  Thus, \r\n  we examine voluntariness at the time Davis gave his confession.\r\nâ€œWhen reviewing a trial courtâ€™s ruling concerning \r\n  voluntariness, this Court does not reevaluate the facts based on its own view \r\n  of the preponderance of the evidence, but simply determines whether the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.â€ State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. \r\n  114, 136, 551 S.E.2d 240, 252 (2001); see State v. Rochester, \r\n  301 S.C. 196, 200, 391 S.E.2d 244, 247 (1990) (holding the conclusion of the \r\n  circuit court on issues of fact as to the voluntariness of a confession will \r\n  not be disturbed on appeal unless so manifestly erroneous as to show an abuse \r\n  of discretion).\r\nIn the circuit courtâ€™s consideration of the totality \r\n  of the circumstances, the only factor that weighed against the voluntariness \r\n  of the confession was the fact that Davis received a promise of leniency before \r\n  confessing. Id., at 200, 391 S.E.2d at 246-47 (holding a promise of leniency \r\n  is a factor to be considered in determining whether a statement was voluntarily \r\n  given, but does not always necessitate a finding that the statement was involuntarily \r\n  given).\r\nThe remaining factors favored a finding that the \r\n  confession was voluntarily given.Â  Foremost in this analysis was the fact that \r\n  Davisâ€™ offer to confess in return for a specific sentence resulted in the promise \r\n  of leniency from the police officer.Â  See Drew v. State, 503 N.E.2d \r\n  613, 617 (Ind. 1987) (â€œ[T]he promise of . . . leniency was not initiated by \r\n  the State, but rather resulted in response to a specific request by the defendant, \r\n  who solicited the promise[ ] as a precondition for making a full statement.Â  \r\n  Thus, the defendant had already manifested the propensity and willingness to \r\n  make a voluntary statement before the occurrence of any action on the part of \r\n  the State.â€); State v. Harwick, 552 P.2d 987, 990 (Kan. 1976) \r\n  (â€œWhen the promises are solicited by the accused, freely and voluntarily, the \r\n  accused cannot be heard to say that in accepting the promise he was the victim \r\n  of a compelling influence.â€). \r\nIn addition, Davis was advised of his Miranda \r\n  rights and consulted privately with his attorney prior to making the offer to \r\n  confess. Cf. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 466 (1966) (â€œThe \r\n  presence of counsel . . . would insure that statements made in the government-established \r\n  atmosphere are not the product of compulsion.â€). Â \r\nFurthermore, the record does not reflect: 1) the \r\n  questioning was unreasonably lengthy; 2) the police officer engaged in deceit \r\n  or trickery; 3) the police officer made physical threats against Davis; or 4) \r\n  Davis was subjected to physical violence.Â  See Rochester, 301 \r\n  S.C. at 201, 391 S.E.2d at 247 (holding lengthy questioning, trickery, threats \r\n  of violence, and the use of violence all weigh against finding a confession \r\n  was voluntarily given).\r\nAfter reviewing the totality of the circumstances, \r\n  the circuit court determined Davisâ€™ confession was voluntarily given.Â  Because \r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s decision was supported by the evidence, the circuit court \r\n  did not err by making this determination.Â  See Saltz, 346 S.C. \r\n  at 136, 551 S.E.2d at 252 (â€œWhen reviewing a trial courtâ€™s ruling concerning \r\n  voluntariness, this Court . . . simply determines whether the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  ruling is supported by any evidence.â€); see also State v. Richardson, \r\n  342 S.E.2d 823, 831 (N.C. 1986) (â€œPromises or other statements indicating to \r\n  an accused that he will receive some benefit if he confesses do not render his \r\n  confession involuntary when made in response to a solicitation by the accused.â€); \r\n  People v. Wright, 469 N.E.2d 351, 354 (Ill. Ct. App. 1984) (holding defendantâ€™s \r\n  confession following Stateâ€™s promise not to seek death penalty deemed voluntary, \r\n  as defendant initiated discussion and stated he would not confess unless State \r\n  promised not to seek death penalty); Taylor v. Commonwealth, 461 S.W.2d \r\n  920, 922 (Ky. 1970) (holding â€œthe circumstances of the promise in the instant \r\n  case were entirely compatible with the exercise by the appellants of a free \r\n  volition in the giving of the confessionsâ€ because one of the defendants proposed \r\n  the deal to police and the other obtained the advice of counsel before agreeing \r\n  to the confession deal); Thomas v. State, 531 So.2d 45, 48 (Ala. Crim. \r\n  App. 1988) (holding a confession is not involuntarily given when the defendant \r\n  made the request for leniency without being coerced by the police officer). [3] Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Refusal to Enforce Plea Agreement\r\nDavis argues the circuit court erred \r\n  by refusing to enforce the plea agreement.Â  Specifically, Davis contends the \r\n  circuit court erred by failing to apply a clear and convincing burden of proof \r\n  in determining whether Davis breached the terms of the plea agreement.Â  Davis \r\n  argues the evidence presented by the Solicitor was not sufficient to meet this \r\n  higher burden of proof.Â  We disagree.\r\nPlea agreements are contractual in nature, and \r\n  courts use traditional principles of contract law to interpret and enforce them.Â  \r\n  See State v. Thrift, 312 S.C. 282, 292-93, 440 S.E.2d 341, 347 \r\n  (1994) (citation omitted).Â  When the defendant breaches a plea agreement, the \r\n  Solicitor is released from his obligations thereunder. State v. Tillman, \r\n  320 S.C. 61, 63, 463 S.E.2d 94, 96 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  In determining whether \r\n  the defendant has breached the plea agreement, the circuit courtâ€™s â€œanalysis \r\n  must be more stringent than a contract [analysis] because the rights involved \r\n  are fundamental and constitutionally based.â€Â  Thrift, 312 S.C. at 293, \r\n  440 S.E.2d at 347.\r\nDavis argues Thrift requires the \r\n  circuit court to use a clear and convincing evidence standard to determine whether \r\n  Davis breached the plea agreement by failing to disclose crimes in which he \r\n  was involved.Â  See Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 577 (7th ed. 1999) (stating \r\n  clear and convincing evidence â€œis a greater burden than preponderance of the \r\n  evidence, the standard applied in most civil trialsâ€).Â  \r\nWe conclude this argument is without merit.Â  Assuming, \r\n  without deciding, Thrift requires the circuit court to apply a clear \r\n  and convincing evidence standard, the circuit court did so in the present case.Â  \r\n  After reviewing the applicable law, the terms of the plea agreement, and the \r\n  omissions in Davisâ€™ statement, the circuit court found, â€œ[e]ven when holding \r\n  the State to a higher degree of responsibility, this Court is clearly convinced \r\n  that the State has presented more than enough evidence to support its contention \r\n  that Arthur Tyrone Davis breached his plea agreement.â€ (emphasis added).Â  \r\nFurthermore, the Solicitor presented adequate evidence \r\n  to support the circuit courtâ€™s conclusion.Â  The Solicitor presented a co-defendantâ€™s \r\n  statement and testimony from an investigating police officer outlining independent \r\n  corroboration of Davisâ€™ involvement in crimes not disclosed pursuant to the \r\n  plea agreement, as well as documents verifying Davis pawned stolen goods from \r\n  those crimes.Â  \r\nBecause the circuit court found clear evidence \r\n  convincing it that Davis was involved in crimes he failed to disclose to the \r\n  Solicitor, the circuit court did not err by finding Davis breached the plea \r\n  agreement. See State v. Amerson, 311 S.C. 316, 320, 428 S.E.2d \r\n  871, 873 (1993) (â€œAppellate courts are bound by fact findings in response to \r\n  motions preliminary to trial when the findings are supported by the evidence \r\n  and not clearly wrong or controlled by error of law.â€). Â Thus, the circuit court \r\n  did not err by denying Davisâ€™ motion to enforce the plea agreement. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the above, Davisâ€™ convictions \r\n  are \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HOWARD, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concurring.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Smith did not represent Davis at trial.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] We note, Rule 410, SCRE, addresses the admissibility of statements \r\n    obtained in guilty plea negotiations.Â  However, Davis did not raise this statute \r\n    as a ground for exclusion of the confession, nor did the circuit court rule \r\n    upon its applicability. Therefore, we cannot address it on appeal.Â  See \r\n    Humbert v. State, 345 S.C. 332, 337, 548 S.E.2d 862, 865 (2001) \r\n    (holding to preserve an issue for appellate review, it must have been raised \r\n    to and ruled upon by the circuit court).Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  Davis further contends State \r\n    v. Mathis, 287 S.C. 589, 340 S.E.2d 538 (1986) required the circuit court \r\n    to exclude the confession he gave as part of the plea agreement.Â  In Mathis, \r\n    our supreme court stated a defendantâ€™s guilty plea cannot be introduced into \r\n    evidence. Id. at 592-93, 340 S.E.2d at 540-41.Â  In explaining the ruling, \r\n    our supreme court distinguished guilty pleas from â€œprior inconsistent statements \r\n    (including confessions),â€ noting confessions may be used as evidence. Id. \r\n    at 592, 340 S.E.2d at 540; cf. Kercheval v. U.S., 274 U.S. 220, \r\n    223 (1927) (â€œA plea of guilty differs in purpose and effect from a mere admission \r\n    or an extrajudicial confession.â€).Â  Because Davis moved to suppress his confession \r\n    at trial, but did not argue evidence of his plea offer was inadmissible, Mathis \r\n    is inapplicable to the facts of this case.Â  To the extent Davis argues evidence \r\n    of his plea agreement was inadmissible, this issue is not preserved for appellate \r\n    review.Â  See Humbert, 345 S.C. at 337, 548 S.E.2d at 865 (holding \r\n    to preserve an issue for appellate review, it must have been raised to and \r\n    ruled on by the circuit court).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-252","title":"State v.

Pride II, of Columbia, \r\n  for Appellant.Â  \r\nEdward S. McCallum, III, of Greenwood, and James&nbsp;B. Richardson, \r\n  Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this action to foreclose \r\n  a mechanicâ€™s lien, the trial court awarded homebuilder Paul Zahn a $43,848.73 \r\n  judgment against homeowner Sadie Allen.Â  Allen appeals, arguing the trial court \r\n  erred in:Â  (1) finding the mechanicâ€™s lien was timely filed; (2) ruling she \r\n  was liable under the contract; and (3) awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to Zahn.Â  We \r\n  affirm. [1] \r\nBACKGROUND\r\nThe parties contracted for Zahn to build \r\n  Allen a house.Â  The house was based on a design the parties modified to accommodate \r\n  Allenâ€™s needs including handicapped features for her mother.Â  It is undisputed \r\n  Zahn made mistakes in constructing the home.Â  He also failed to deliver it in \r\n  a timely fashion.Â  After Zahn informed Allen the home was complete and demanded \r\n  payment, Allen refused to pay the remainder due under the contract until the \r\n  home could be independently inspected.Â  In response to a complaint filed by \r\n  Allen, an inspector with the South Carolina Department of Labor, Licensing, \r\n  and Regulation inspected the home, finding a number of construction deficiencies.Â  \r\n  Zahn repaired the items noted in the report and approximately a month later \r\n  filed a mechanicâ€™s lien and this action.Â  Allen answered, asserting several \r\n  affirmative defenses and a breach of contract counterclaim.Â  Zahn completed \r\n  additional repairs after the filing of pleadings.Â  However, problems continued \r\n  with the home.Â  \r\nFollowing a bench trial, the trial court issued an \r\n  order finding Zahn timely filed the mechanicâ€™s lien and awarding him $43,848.73.Â  \r\n  This amount reflected two setoffs to Allen, one for the interest she lost during \r\n  the time between scheduled delivery and actual completion and another for repair \r\n  costs to correct an error in the foyerâ€™s construction.Â  The court also held \r\n  Zahn was entitled to legal fees and costs it later determined to be $14,610.08.Â  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filing of the Mechanicâ€™s Lien \r\n   \r\nAllen argues the trial \r\n  court erred in concluding Zahn timely filed his mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œAn action to foreclose a mechanicâ€™s lien is a \r\n  law case in South Carolina.â€Â  Keeneyâ€™s Metal Roofing, Inc. v. Palmieri, \r\n  345 S.C. 550, 553, 548 S.E.2d 900, 901 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  In an action at law \r\n  tried without a jury, the appellate courtâ€™s standard of review extends only \r\n  to the correction of errors of law.Â  Barnacle Broad. v. Baker Broad., \r\n  343 S.C. 140, 146, 538 S.E.2d 672, 675 (Ct. App. 2000), cert. dismissed, \r\n  348 S.C. 11, 558 S.E.2d 516 (2002).Â  Therefore, the trial courtâ€™s factual \r\n  findings will not be disturbed on appeal unless the record discloses there is \r\n  no evidence reasonably supporting the courtâ€™s findings.Â  Id.\r\nMechanicsâ€™ liens \r\n  [2]  serve to secure payment for a â€œperson to whom a debt is due for labor \r\n  performed or furnished or for materials furnished and actually used in the erection \r\n  . . . of a building or structure . . . by virtue of an agreement with, or by \r\n  consent of, the owner of the building or structure.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10(a) \r\n  (Supp. 2003). \r\nFor a person to be entitled to enforce \r\n  a mechanicâ€™s lien, he must file within ninety days of furnishing labor or materials \r\n  for the building or structure.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-90 (providing a mechanicâ€™s \r\n  lien â€œshall be dissolvedâ€ unless the person holding the lien serves and files \r\n  the lien within ninety days of providing labor or materials); see also \r\n  Preferred Sav. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n, Inc. v. Royal Garden Resort, Inc., 301 \r\n  S.C. 1, 4, 389 S.E.2d 853, 854 (1990) (stating when a person files a mechanicâ€™s \r\n  lien, he is essentially asserting work has been performed in the ninety days \r\n  prior to filing for which he is entitled to a lien).Â  \r\nThe court found for Zahnâ€™s lien to be timely, he \r\n  must have performed work sometime between March 28 and June 26, 2000, the date \r\n  he filed the lien.Â  Zahn sent Allen a letter on May 31, 2000 stating the problems \r\n  outlined in LLRâ€™s April 6 report had been remedied.Â  Based on this letter and \r\n  the testimony adduced at trial, the court found Zahn performed work within the \r\n  ninety-day period.Â  Thus the trial court properly found Zahn timely filed his \r\n  lien.\r\nAllen also argues S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-250 (1991) \r\n  precludes Zahn from asserting a mechanicâ€™s lien under the facts of this case.Â  \r\n  However, because Allen raises this issue for the first time on appeal, it is \r\n  not preserved.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 \r\n  S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (finding an issue must be raised to and ruled on by the \r\n  trial court to be preserved for appeal).\r\nII.Â &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEnforceability of Mechanicâ€™s Lien\r\nAllen also contends the trial court erred in finding \r\n  an enforceable mechanicâ€™s lien because it should have found Allen was not liable \r\n  under the contract.Â  The contract provides for final payment to be made â€œat \r\n  the time of completion.â€Â  Allen asserts because numerous problems arose during \r\n  construction, the house was never completed, and thus, the final payment never \r\n  became due.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAllen points to several deficiencies as evidence \r\n  the house was not completed, including problems with the garage, the foundation, \r\n  the foyer, and the roof trusses.Â  She also contends Zahn failed to deliver the \r\n  house for inspection.Â  Zahn repaired some of these items and the trial court \r\n  granted Allen setoffs (1) for the interest she paid to the bank and lost in \r\n  investment income caused by the delay in delivery and (2) to bring the foyer \r\n  into compliance with the building plans.Â  However, the court further noted â€œ[a]ny \r\n  other setoffs alleged by [Allen] that are not mentioned in this order are denied \r\n  because they lacked evidence in the record to support them or no damages were \r\n  proven by Allen.â€Â  Allen does not challenge the sufficiency of the setoffs, \r\n  either by the items they covered or the amounts credited to her.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Zahnâ€™s action was based on a mechanicâ€™s \r\n  lien, not the partiesâ€™ contract.Â  A mechanicâ€™s lien secures payment to the provider \r\n  of materials and labor who provides them either by agreement with or consent \r\n  of the recipient, regardless of the existence of a formal contract.Â  See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10(a) (providing a person due a debt for labor or materials \r\n  furnished in the building, alteration, or repair of a structure on real estate \r\n  shall have a lien against the structure and the ownerâ€™s interest in the land \r\n  on which it is situated).Â  Thus whether Zahn can enforce a mechanicâ€™s lien against \r\n  Allen is based on the materials and labor he provided in the homeâ€™s construction, \r\n  not whether he could demand full payment of the contract amount.Â  \r\nAlthough the court found Zahn breached his agreement \r\n  with Allen, it also found Zahn was entitled to $57,340 for labor and materials \r\n  minus the amount of Allenâ€™s setoffs.Â  In addition to the major construction \r\n  efforts, the record demonstrates Zahn repaired all items brought to his attention \r\n  by LLR, additional items asserted by Allenâ€™s engineer, and that he even made \r\n  repairs during the pendency of litigation.Â  Because the evidence supports the \r\n  courtâ€™s ruling, it properly held the mechanicâ€™s lien was enforceable against \r\n  Allen.Â  \r\nIII.Â &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAttorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nAllen also argues the trial court erred in granting \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees to Zahn.Â  We disagree. \r\nSouth Carolina Code section 29-5-10(a) clearly \r\n  provides â€œ[t]he costs which may arise in enforcing or defending against the \r\n  lien under this chapter, including a reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee, may be recovered \r\n  by the prevailing party.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10(a).Â  This section further \r\n  provides the amount of the fee recovered is to be decided by the court, but \r\n  in no event should the fee and costs exceed the amount of the lien.Â  Id.\r\nSubsection (b) provides instructions to determine \r\n  who is the prevailing party for the purposes of awarding attorneyâ€™s fees and \r\n  litigation expenses.Â  The party whose settlement offer is closer to the ultimate \r\n  verdict is the prevailing party.Â  In the event neither party makes a settlement \r\n  offer, the amount prayed for in the complaint is considered the plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  offer and the value of defendantâ€™s counterclaim is the negative value of his \r\n  settlement offer.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§&nbsp;29-5-10(b).Â  \r\nAs neither party made a settlement offer under \r\n  section 29-5-10(b), Zahnâ€™s offer is considered the amount he prayed for in his \r\n  complaint, or $58,355, whereas Allenâ€™s is considered to be the value of her \r\n  counterclaim, or negative $5,000.Â  Because Zahnâ€™s settlement offer is closer \r\n  to the ultimate verdict of $43,848.73 than negative $5,000, Zahn is clearly \r\n  the prevailing party and therefore entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  See \r\n  Brasington Tile Co., Inc.&nbsp;v. Worley, 327 S.C. 280, 288, 491 S.E.2d \r\n  244, 248 (1997) (holding that in determining the prevailing party in a mechanicâ€™s \r\n  lien case, the ultimate verdict should include setoffs).Â  \r\nHowever, Allen argues the court erred in considering \r\n  the contingency fee agreement between Zahn and his attorney because the agreement \r\n  did not differentiate between the amount of time spent on assertion of the lien \r\n  claim and the time spent defending against Allenâ€™s counterclaims.Â  Allen relies \r\n  on Utilities Constr. Co., Inc. v. Wilson, 321 S.C. 244, 468 S.E.2d 1 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1996), to support the argument that the time spent by Zahnâ€™s counsel \r\n  on these items should be separate.Â  We find this reliance misplaced.Â  \r\nIn Utilities Constr., a utility company brought three \r\n  causes of action against Wilsonâ€”a mechanicâ€™s lien foreclosure claim, unjust \r\n  enrichment, and breach of contract.Â  The court directed a verdict against the \r\n  utility company on the mechanicâ€™s lien claim, and the remaining causes of action \r\n  were submitted to the jury. Â The jury subsequently returned a verdict for the \r\n  utility company.Â  Id. at 246, 468 S.E.2d at 2.Â  \r\nHaving prevailed on the mechanicâ€™s lien claim, the court \r\n  awarded Wilson attorneyâ€™s fees pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10(a).Â  Id.Â  \r\n  The utility company appealed this award arguing it should have received the \r\n  award because it was the prevailing party on the verdict.Â  The court disagreed, \r\n  holding â€œit is the enforcement of the lien which confers the right to attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees, and not the joinder of an attempted enforcement with another non-statutory \r\n  cause of action on which the lienor prevails.â€Â  Id. at 247-248, 468 S.E.2d \r\n  at 2.Â  Accordingly, the case stands for the proposition that when a plaintiff \r\n  brings a mechanicâ€™s lien action along with other causes of action, if the plaintiff \r\n  does not prevail on the mechanicâ€™s lien claim, he or she is not entitled to \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees under the statute.Â  As the case does not stand for the proposition \r\n  for which Allen cites it, we find her argument without merit.\r\nAllen also argues the trial court erred by considering the \r\n  contingency fee agreement in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees because it does not comport \r\n  with Rule 407, SCACR.Â  We disagree.Â  The reasonableness of a statutorily mandated \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fee award is not controlled by a contract between lawyer and client.Â  \r\n  See, e.g., Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 308, 486 S.E.2d 750, \r\n  759 (1997); see also Blumberg v. Nealco, Inc., 310 S.C. 492, 494, \r\n  427 S.E.2d 659, 660 (1993) (noting six factors to be considered when considering \r\n  reasonableness of an award for attorneyâ€™s fees).\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ., and\r\nCURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule \r\n    215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Mechanicsâ€™ liens are creatures of statute in South Carolina.Â  \r\n    See S.C.

Victor Rawl, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-267\r\nSubmitted February 20, 2004 â€“ Filed April 19, 2004 \r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Tara S. Taggart, of the South \r\n  Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Attorney General David Spencer, all of Columbia; \r\n  and Solicitor Ralph E. Hoisington, of Charleston; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Edward N. Dawson seeks a remand \r\n  for re-sentencing on the charge of possession of a stolen motor vehicle, claiming \r\n  for the first time on appeal that he was â€œentitled to be sentenced in open court \r\n  rather than simply in writingâ€ for that offense.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nA jury convicted Dawson of second-degree burglary \r\n  and possession of a stolen vehicle.Â  On October 23, 2002, the day after the \r\n  trial ended and while Dawson was present in the courtroom with his counsel during \r\n  a sentencing proceeding for both convictions, the trial judge concluded:Â  â€œSentence \r\n  of the Court is life without parole, based on 17-25-45.â€ \r\n  [2] Â  Neither the solicitor nor defense counsel brought to the attention \r\n  of the trial judge any concerns regarding a sentence for the vehicle offense.Â  \r\n\r\nTwo days later, the trial judge signed the sentencing \r\n  orders in the case.Â  The orders formally declared to Dawson the legal consequences \r\n  of his convictions and committed him to the State Department of Corrections \r\n  for concurrent terms of life imprisonment for the burglary offense and five \r\n  years for the vehicle offense.Â  See 21A Am. Jur. 2d Criminal Law \r\n  Â§791, at 54-55 (1998) (â€œIn a legal sense, sentence is ordinarily synonymous \r\n  with judgment and denotes the judgment of the court which formally declares \r\n  to the accused the legal consequences of his or her conviction . . . .â€); see \r\n  also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-21-80(2) (2003) (authorizing a sentence of up to \r\n  five years for possession of a stolen vehicle worth more than $1,000 but less \r\n  than $5,000).Â  Both the solicitor and defense counsel also signed the sentencing \r\n  order.Â  Defense counsel, however, filed no post-trial motions regarding the \r\n  vehicle offense and Dawsonâ€™s sentence therefor.Â  See SCRCrimP, Rule 29(a) \r\n  (â€œ[P]ost trial motions shall be made within ten (10) days after the imposition \r\n  of the sentence.â€).\r\nWe recognize that a defendant has the right to \r\n  be present at the time of sentencing.Â  21 Am. Jur. 2d Criminal Law Â§ \r\n  798, at 62 (1998).Â  In this case, Dawson was present at his sentencing proceeding, \r\n  a rather lengthy one, and he fully participated in that proceeding, even addressing \r\n  the trial judge when given the opportunity to do so.Â  Dawsonâ€™s sole contention \r\n  on appeal is that he was â€œentitled to be sentenced in open court rather than \r\n  simply in writing.â€Â  \r\nBecause Dawson failed at the sentencing hearing \r\n  to raise the issue of the trial judgeâ€™s omitting to announce his sentence for \r\n  the vehicular offense and because he also failed to assert any alleged error \r\n  in his sentencing within ten days after the trial judge imposed the sentence, \r\n  the issue has not been preserved for our review.Â  See State v.

McDow, of Rock Hill, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; Joyce Sinclair Cutshaw (Wife) appeals the\r\nprovision of the family court order placing the valuation on the real property\r\nallotted to Charles Ellis Cutshaw (Husband), and the apportionment of unsecured\r\nmartial debt.&nbsp; We affirm.[1]&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nThe family\r\ncourt granted Husband and Wife a divorce and issued an order apportioning the\r\nmarital property and debt.&nbsp; All\r\nassets and debt were divided equally except for two parcels of property:&nbsp;\r\n(1) a house and seventeen acres located in Farmwood Estates and (2) a\r\nhouse and twelve acres located on Trussel Road.&nbsp;\r\nHusband and Wife each had independent experts appraise the properties for\r\nthe purpose of equitable distribution.&nbsp; Husbandâ€™s\r\nappraiser valued Farmwood at $118,000, while Wifeâ€™s appraiser valued it at\r\n$154,000.&nbsp; Husbandâ€™s appraiser\r\nsubmitted a value of $84,000 on Trussel Road, compared with a valuation of\r\n$98,000 offered by Wifeâ€™s appraiser.&nbsp; The\r\nfamily court awarded Farmwood to Husband with a 45 percent equity interest\r\nretained by Wife, and awarded Trussel Road to Wife with a 45 percent equity\r\ninterest retained by Husband.&nbsp; For\r\nboth parcels, the court accepted the appraised values placed on them by the\r\nappraiser for the party to whom the property was awarded; that is, the court\r\nused Husbandâ€™s appraisal for Farmwood and Wifeâ€™s appraisal for Trussel Road.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\nWife appeals the valuation assigned to Husbandâ€™s property at Farmwood\r\nand also the distribution of unsecured marital debt, contending it to be\r\ninequitable.&nbsp;\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n  In appeals from the family court, this court may find facts in accordance \r\n  with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Miles v. Miles, \r\n  355 S.C. 511, 516, 586 S.E.2d 136, 139 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  However, this broad \r\n  scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s determinations.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  Nor do we ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard \r\n  the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign \r\n  comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Id.Â   \r\n \r\nI.Â  Valuation of \r\n  Farmwood\r\nWife claims the family court erred in adopting Husbandâ€™s valuation \r\n  of Farmwood, arguing the appraisal was too low in light of all the evidence.Â  \r\n  We disagree. \r\nIn valuing marital property, the family court may give such weight to expert \r\n  testimony as it deems appropriate.Â  Smith v. Smith, 294 S.C. 194, 200, \r\n  363 S.E.2d 404, 408 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Therefore, the court may accept one partyâ€™s \r\n  valuation of marital property over anotherâ€™s.Â  Id. at 200-201, 363 S.E.2d \r\n  at 4078.Â  \r\n  The family courtâ€™s valuation will not be disturbed if it is within the range \r\n  of evidence.Â  Woodward v. Woodward, 294 S.C. 210, 215, 363 S.E.2d 413, \r\n  416 (Ct. App. 1987).\r\nHusbandâ€™s appraiser testified Farmwood had a value of $118,000 at \r\n  the time of trial.Â  Although Wifeâ€™s expert valued the property at $154,000, \r\n  we note the same expert valued the property at $120,000 less than two years \r\n  earlier when the parties refinanced the property.Â  We therefore conclude the \r\n  valuation assigned to Farmwood was within the range of values supported by the \r\n  evidence.Â  Accordingly, the family court did not err by adopting Husbandâ€™s appraisal.\r\nII.Â  Allocation of Unsecured Marital Debt\r\nWife argues the family court erred by allocating 50 percent of the \r\n  unsecured marital debt to her.Â  She contends the court abused its discretion \r\n  by requiring her to pay an equal share of the debt while only giving her a 45 \r\n  percent interest in Farmwood.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen apportioning marital debt, the family court must consider the \r\n  factors set out in S.C. Code section 20-7-472 (Supp. 2003).Â  The statute vests the family \r\n  court with discretion to decide what weight should be assigned to the various \r\n  factors of equitable apportionment.Â  On review, we look to the fairness of the \r\n  overall apportionment; if the end result is equitable, it is irrelevant that \r\n  we might have weighed specific factors differently than the family court.Â  Jenkins \r\n  v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 100, 545 S.E.2d 531, 537 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nWife argues because a portion of the marital debt was incurred to \r\n  pay for improvements to Farmwood as well as Husbandâ€™s medical bills, the family \r\n  court should have made Husband pay a greater share of the debt.Â  The debt was \r\n  not limited to expenses for Husband alone.Â  Moreover, Wife received an equal \r\n  share of the personal property accumulated during the marriage, despite the \r\n  fact she earned only 35 percent of the household income.Â  As such, when considering \r\n  the overall distribution, we find no abuse of discretion in the equitable distribution \r\n  of marital debt.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ., and\r\nCURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [1]\r\n   \r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215,\r\n  SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-270","title":"Anderson v.

Anderson, \r\n  Robert Ressler, Diane Ressler, William Todt, Thomas A. Brooks, Juliana S. Calhoun, \r\n  Robin Lee, Keith Lee, Donald J. Hatcher, Michele B. Hatcher, Philip D. Lanfried, \r\n  and Jean F. Landfried (collectively â€œthe Neighborsâ€), sued Hank and Linda Buonforte \r\n  (collectively â€œthe Buonfortesâ€), seeking to enforce the restrictive covenants \r\n  of the Indian Hills Subdivision in Sumter, South Carolina.Â  The special referee \r\n  ordered the Buonfortes to remove a two-car garage from their property and modify \r\n  a recently built extension to their home.Â Â  Both parties appeal.Â  We affirm. \r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe Buonfortes began construction \r\n  of a house in the Indian Hills Subdivision in Sumter, South Carolina.Â Â  Hank \r\n  Buonforte convinced his parents to move into his home, promising to build an \r\n  extension to the main house (â€œthe mother-in-law wingâ€). Thereafter, he approached \r\n  the City Planning Directorâ€™s Office for a variance to his permit and applied \r\n  to the Sumter City-County Board of Appeals (â€œthe Boardâ€) for a variance to the \r\n  cityâ€™s setback requirements to build a garage. However, at the Buonfortesâ€™ hearing \r\n  before the Board, several neighbors appeared in opposition to the request. \r\nThe Buonfortes applied \r\n  for a variance with the subdivisionâ€™s designated representative for enforcement \r\n  of the restrictive covenants.Â  However, eighteen days later, before the Buonfortes \r\n  received a response from the representative, the Neighbors sued the Buonfortes, \r\n  alleging the Buonfortesâ€™ mother-in-law wing and garage violated the communityâ€™s \r\n  restrictive covenants because:Â  1) the main structure was no longer a single-family \r\n  dwelling; and 2) the house no longer complied with the setback lines.Â  Additionally, \r\n  the Neighbors sought a temporary restraining order prohibiting any further construction \r\n  on the lot. \r\nAfter a full hearing on the merits, \r\n  the special referee ruled the home was a single-family dwelling within the meaning \r\n  of the term in the restrictive covenants.Â  Furthermore, the special referee \r\n  determined the house violated â€œthe general scheme of developmentâ€ and ordered \r\n  the garage removed and the â€œmother-in-law wingâ€ altered to better conform to \r\n  surrounding houses.Â  The special referee also ordered the Buonfortes to pay \r\n  all court costs and special referee fees.Â  Both parties appeal.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  An action to enforce \r\n  a restrictive covenant is in equity.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Natural Res. \r\n  v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 622, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302 (2001).Â  \r\n  As such, this court may view the facts in accordance with our preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.Â  However, we should not disregard the findings of the special \r\n  referee, who was in a better position to weigh the credibility of witnesses.Â  \r\n  Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 237, 391 S.E.2d 538, \r\n  543 (1990).\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Neighborsâ€™ \r\n  Appeal\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  â€œSingle-Family Dwellingâ€\r\nInitially, the Neighbors argue \r\n  the special referee erred by failing to rule on whether the Buonfortesâ€™ house \r\n  was a single-family dwelling or a duplex.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn appellate court must \r\n  view the trial courtâ€™s statements as a whole to determine its reasoning.Â  State \r\n  v. Evans, 354 S.C. 579, 584, 582 S.E.2d 407, 410 (2003).Â  Furthermore, â€œ[a]n \r\n  order should be construed within the context of the proceeding in which it is \r\n  rendered.â€Â  Dibble v. Sumter Ice &amp; Fuel Co., 283 S.C. 278, 282, 322 \r\n  S.E.2d 674, 677 (Ct. App. 1984); see also Eddins v. Eddins, 304 \r\n  S.C. 133, 135, 403 S.E.2d 164, 166 (Ct. App. 1991) (holding judgments are to \r\n  be construed as other instruments, and the determinative factor is the intention \r\n  of the court, considering the judgment in its entirety).Â  \r\nThe special refereeâ€™s \r\n  order specifically found the Buonfortesâ€™ house, â€œconstitutes a single family \r\n  unit as defined by the restrictive covenants.â€ Thus, the Neighborsâ€™ claim is \r\n  without merit.\r\nNext, the Neighbors assert the \r\n  contrary argument that the special referee erred by ruling on whether the Buonfortesâ€™ \r\n  structure constituted a single-family dwelling or a duplex. They contend this \r\n  issue was neither raised by the pleadings nor argued at trial.Â  We disagree. \r\n\r\nâ€œA judgment must conform to the pleadings and be \r\n  in accordance with the theory of action upon which the case was tried.â€Â  Chandler \r\n  v. Merrel, 291 S.C. 227, 228, 353 S.E.2d 135, 136 (1987).Â Â  However, â€œ[w]hen \r\n  issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of \r\n  the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised \r\n  in the pleadings.â€Â  Rule 15(b), SCRCP.&nbsp; \r\nIn pertinent part, the \r\n  Neighborsâ€™ complaint alleges, â€œthe . . . [Buonfortesâ€™] construction . . . violate[s] \r\n  the restrictive covenants in the following particulars:Â  . . . The . . . [Buonfortes] \r\n  are developing and/ or constructing a residence and attached apartment/duplex \r\n  which is in clear violation of the limit to a single family residence . . . \r\n  .â€Â  Furthermore, during the trial, both the Neighbors and the Buonfortes presented \r\n  extensive testimony about whether the structure was a single-family dwelling \r\n  or a duplex.Â  Neither party objected to the admission of the testimony.Â  Thus, \r\n  this issue was both raised in the pleadings and tried by consent during the \r\n  trial.Â  Consequently, this issue is without merit.\r\nNext, the Neighbors argue the \r\n  special referee erred by considering the testimony of two of the Buonfortesâ€™ \r\n  witnesses.Â  Specifically, the Neighbors claim the testimony was irrelevant.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nâ€œAny evidence that assists in \r\n  getting at the truth of the issue is relevant and admissible, unless because \r\n  of some legal rule it is incompetent.â€Â  Toole v. Salter, 249 S.C. 354, \r\n  361, 154 S.E.2d 434, 437 (1967).Â  Furthermore, \r\n\r\n[i]n determining a dispute concerning \r\n  the relevancy of . . . evidence, the question to be resolved is as to whether \r\n  there is a logical or rational connection between the fact which is sought to \r\n  be presented and a matter of fact which has been made an issue in the case. \r\n  Relevancy is that quality of evidence which renders it properly applicable in \r\n  determining the truth and falsity of matters in issue between the parties to \r\n  a suit. All that is required to render evidence admissible is that the fact \r\n  shown thereby legally tends to prove, or make more or less probable, some matter \r\n  in issue, and bear directly or indirectly thereon. \r\n\r\nId.Â  (internal citations \r\n  omitted).Â  Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nWhen a term is not defined within \r\n  a contract, evidence of its usual and customary meaning is competent to aid \r\n  in determining its meaning.Â  S.C.

App. 2003).\r\nThe restrictive covenant states \r\n  only single-family dwellings are permitted on the Buonfortesâ€™ property.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  the covenant expressly prohibits the construction of duplexes.Â  However, neither \r\n  â€œsingle-family dwellingâ€ nor â€œduplexâ€ is defined within the restrictive covenants.Â  \r\n\r\nThus, attempting to demonstrate \r\n  the house was a single-family dwelling, the Buonfortesâ€™ presented the testimony \r\n  of William Henry Hoge, the Planning Director for the Sumter Planning Commission, \r\n  and John Humphries, the Building Official for the City of Sumter, who testified \r\n  that pursuant to the applicable Sumter zoning ordinances, the Buonfortesâ€™ house \r\n  was a single-family dwelling.Â Â  The Neighbors objected, arguing only the testimony \r\n  of Robert Ross Dinkins, the person responsible for enforcing the restrictive \r\n  covenants, was relevant on the issue.Â  \r\nWe conclude the admitted testimony \r\n  was relevant to determine the meaning of the term â€œsingle-family dwellingâ€ within \r\n  the restrictive covenants, as the zoning ordinances were evidence of its usual \r\n  and customary meaning.Â  Thus, the special referee did not err by admitting the \r\n  testimony.\r\nLastly, the Neighbors \r\n  argue the special referee abused his discretion by ruling the Buonfortesâ€™ structure \r\n  was a single-family dwelling.Â  We disagree.\r\nDinkins testified he \r\n  was responsible for enforcing the restrictive covenants, and, in his opinion, \r\n  the structure was a duplex.Â  The Neighbors also admitted the testimony of Charles \r\n  R. McCreight, an architect, who opined the structure was a duplex.Â  \r\nIn response, the Buonfortes \r\n  presented the testimony of Hoge and Humphries.Â  Hoge testified it is his duty \r\n  to enforce the zoning ordinances of the City of Sumter.Â  Additionally, he testified \r\n  the Indians Hills Subdivision is within the City of Sumter, zoned in an area \r\n  where duplexes were prohibited.Â  In his opinion, the structure constituted a \r\n  single-family residence under the applicable Sumter zoning ordinances.Â  Humphries, \r\n  who is responsible for enforcing the City of Sumter building regulations, testified \r\n  the structure was a single-family dwelling and did not meet the definition of \r\n  a duplex within the building code definition.Â  \r\nViewing the entirety of the record, \r\n  we agree with the special referee that the weight of the evidence indicates \r\n  the Buonfortesâ€™ structure was a single-family dwelling for purposes of the restrictive \r\n  covenants.Â  \r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Notice of Restrictive Covenants\r\nThe Neighbors \r\n  argue the special referee erred by finding the Buonfortes were not on notice \r\n  of the restrictive covenants. The Neighbors misunderstand the special refereeâ€™s \r\n  ruling.\r\nAn appellate court must \r\n  view the trial courtâ€™s statements as a whole to determine its reasoning.Â  Evans, \r\n  354 S.C. at 584, 582 S.E.2d at 410.Â  Furthermore, â€œ[a]n order should be construed \r\n  within the context of the proceeding in which it is rendered.â€Â  Dibble, \r\n  283 S.C. at 282, 322 S.E.2d at 677; see also Eddins, 304 S.C. \r\n  at 135, 403 S.E.2d at 166 (holding judgments are to be construed as other instruments, \r\n  and the determinative factor is the intention of the court, considering the \r\n  judgment in its entirety).Â  \r\nConstructive notice and actual notice \r\n  are not one in the same.Â  Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, \r\n  332 S.C. 54, 64, 504 S.E.2d 117, 122 (1998).Â  Rather, a person has actual notice \r\n  â€œwhere the person . . . either knows of the existence of the particular facts \r\n  in question or is conscious of having the means of knowing it, even though such \r\n  means may not be employed by him.â€Â Â  Id. at 64 n. 6, 504 S.E.2d at 122 \r\n  n. 6.Â  In contrast, â€œconstructive notice is a legal inference which substitutes \r\n  for actual notice. It is notice imputed to a person whose knowledge of facts \r\n  is sufficient to put him on inquiry; if these facts were pursued with due diligence, \r\n  they would lead to other undisclosed facts.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œA homeowner is charged \r\n  with constructive notice of any restriction properly recorded within the chain \r\n  of title.â€Â  Harbison Comm. Assâ€™n, Inc., v. Mueller, 319 S.C. 99, 103, \r\n  459 S.E.2d 860, 863 (Ct. App. 1995).\r\nThe Buonfortes bought \r\n  a piece of property in the Indian Hills Subdivision with restrictive covenants \r\n  in the chain of title.Â  The Buonfortes denied actual notice of the restrictive \r\n  covenants.Â  The Neighbors did not present any evidence within the record indicating \r\n  the Buonfortes were on actual notice of the restrictive covenants.\r\nIn the findings of fact, the \r\n  special refereeâ€™s final order states that the Buonfortesâ€™ deed did not put the \r\n  Buonfortes on â€œadequateâ€ notice of the restrictive covenants.Â  Subsequently, \r\n  as a conclusion of law, the special referee held the Buonfortes were unaware \r\n  of the restrictive covenants when they began building the garage and mother-in-law \r\n  wing.Â  \r\nWe conclude a reasonable \r\n  reading of the special refereeâ€™s order, in light of the proceedings in which \r\n  it was rendered, indicates the special referee found the Buonfortes were not \r\n  on actual notice, as opposed to constructive notice, of the restrictive covenants.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, this finding is supported by the weight of the evidence within \r\n  the record.Â  Thus, we hold the special referee did not err. \r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â  Balancing of the Equities\r\nThe Neighbors argue \r\n  the special referee erred by balancing the equities in an arbitrary and unfair \r\n  manner.Â  Specifically, the Neighbors contend the Buonfortes came to the hearing \r\n  with â€œunclean hands,â€ and thus, both the mother-in-law wing and the garage should \r\n  be removed.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen this court is sitting \r\n  in equity, and thus viewing evidence for our own preponderance, we are to consider \r\n  the equities of both sides, balancing the two to determine what, if any, relief \r\n  to give.Â  See Foreman v. Foreman, 280 S.C. 461, 464-65, 313 S.E.2d \r\n  312, 314 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  However, if a party has unclean hands, the party \r\n  is precluded from recovering in equity.Â  A party will have unclean hands, where \r\n  the party behaves â€œunfairly in a matter that is the subject of the litigation \r\n  to the prejudice of the defendant.â€Â Â  Ingram v. Kaseyâ€™s Assocs., 340 \r\n  S.C. 98, 107, 531 S.E.2d 287, 292 (2000). \r\nThe Neighbors sued the Buonfortes, \r\n  seeking to enforce the restrictive covenants of the Indian Hills Subdivision.Â  \r\n  Specifically, the Neighbors argued the additions to the Buonfortesâ€™ house created \r\n  a duplex, the mother-in-wing and garage violated the setback lines, and the \r\n  mother-in-law wing and garage did not conform with the aesthetics of the neighborhood.Â  \r\n\r\nWhile the litigation was pending, \r\n  the parties signed a consent order providing the following:\r\n\r\nORDERED, that the . . . [Buonfortes] \r\n  immediately cease any further construction regarding the â€œmother-in-law wingâ€ \r\n  on the property . . . . The . . . [Buonfortes] will be permitted to install \r\n  the front window units of said wing along with the door, and can also complete \r\n  the sides and rear of said wing, however, the . . . [Buonfortes] may not continue \r\n  to build or improve the front of the structure.Â  Further, the . . . [Buonfortes] \r\n  may not destruct or improve the wall separating the â€œmother-in-lawâ€ wing from \r\n  the main structure . . . . ORDERED, that the . . . [Buonfortes] be allowed to \r\n  complete the main structure of said building . . . Further, the . . . [Buonfortes] \r\n  will be allowed to complete the interior of the balance of the structure . . \r\n  . and the exterior of the entire structure . . . ORDERED, that if the . . \r\n  . [Buonfortes] do continue to build or improve said property beyond the parameters \r\n  of this Order, that the . . . [Buonfortes] do so at their own risk[.]\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nSubsequently, the Buonfortes \r\n  completed construction of the garage and interior of the mother-in-law wing.Â  \r\n  Following a final hearing, the special referee ruled the Buonfortes must remove \r\n  the garage.Â  Furthermore, the special referee ruled the Buonfortes must remove \r\n  the front door entrance of the mother-in-law wing, such that the house now only \r\n  has one front entrance.Â  Moreover, the special referee ordered the Buonfortes \r\n  to remove the gabled entrance roof.Â  \r\nThe Neighbors now contend \r\n  the special referee erred by balancing the equities to allow the mother-in-law \r\n  wing to remain because the Buonfortes are seeking equity with unclean hands.Â  \r\n  Specifically, the Neighbors allege the following particulars weigh against the \r\n  Buonfortes:Â  1) the Buonfortes misrepresented information on their original \r\n  building permit because they did not request a permit for the additions to the \r\n  house, although they knew they planned to construct additions; 2) the Buonfortes \r\n  had constructive knowledge of the restrictive covenants before they began to \r\n  build the additions to their house; and 3) the Buonfortes continued to build \r\n  after they had actual knowledge of the restrictive covenants.\r\n We do not view the evidence \r\n  in the same light as the Neighbors.Â  Rather, our view of the evidence indicates \r\n  the Buonfortes applied for a building permit to construct their original residence.Â  \r\n  Although the Buonfortes may have intended to construct additions to their residence \r\n  when they applied for the original building permit, they did not intend to do \r\n  so without acquiring an additional permit.Â  In fact, prior to construction of \r\n  the additional structures, the Buonfortes applied for permits to build the additional \r\n  structures, leading to this lawsuit.\r\nThe evidence also indicates \r\n  the Buonfortes were not on actual notice of the restrictive covenants, as no \r\n  evidence exists within the record indicating they actually knew the restrictive \r\n  covenants existed.Â  Rather, the evidence indicates that prior to buying the \r\n  piece of property, the Buonfortes hired an attorney to conduct a title search.Â  \r\n  The attorneyâ€™s report does not indicate the existence of restrictive covenants.Â  \r\n  Thus, although the Buonfortes were on constructive notice of the restrictive \r\n  covenants, they were not on actual notice, mitigating any allegation of unclean \r\n  hands.\r\nPursuant to the above \r\n  quoted agreement, the Buonfortes continued to build the additions to their home \r\n  after commencement of this lawsuit.Â  With the exception of the garage, which \r\n  the special referee ordered the Buonfortes to remove, the continued building \r\n  was permitted under the agreement.Â  \r\nWe conclude the Buonfortes \r\n  did not have unclean hands such that they are precluded from the aide of equity, \r\n  as they have not acted unfairly to the prejudice of the Neighbors.Â  Moreover, \r\n  we conclude the special referee appropriately weighed the equities of the situation.Â  \r\n  Thus, we hold the special referee did not err. \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  The Buonfortesâ€™ \r\n  Appeal\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  General Scheme of Development\r\nThe Buonfortes \r\n  argue the special referee erred by ordering them to remove the garage and alter \r\n  the mother-in-law wing.Â  They contend Dinkins implicitly approved their construction \r\n  plans pursuant to an automatic approval provision in the restrictive covenants.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe cardinal rule of contract interpretation \r\n  is to ascertain and give legal effect to the partiesâ€™ intentions as determined \r\n  by the contract language.â€Â  Schulmeyer v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., \r\n  353 S.C. 491, 495, 579 S.E.2d 132, 134 (2003).Â  Thus, â€œ[i]f the contractâ€™s language \r\n  is clear and unambiguous, the language alone determines the contractâ€™s force \r\n  and effect.â€Â  Id.\r\nThe restrictive covenants provide: \r\n\r\nIn the event Robert Ross Dinkins, or his designated representative, \r\n  fails to approve or disapprove within thirty days after plans and specifications \r\n  have been submitted to him, or in the event no suits to enjoin the construction \r\n  have been commenced prior to the completion thereof, approval will not be required \r\n  and the related covenants shall be deemed to have been fully complied with.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nThe Buonfortes submitted a copy \r\n  of their plans to Dinkins.Â  Subsequently, approximately eighteen days after \r\n  the Buonfortes submitted their plans to Dinkins and before Dinkins responded, \r\n  the Neighbors sued the Buonfortes.Â  Because the Neighbors filed suit against \r\n  the Buonfortes before the expiration of Dinkinsâ€™ thirty days response period, \r\n  we hold this provision of the restrictive covenants is inapplicable.\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Fees and Costs\r\nThe Buonfortes argue \r\n  the special referee erred by ordering them to pay all of the fees and costs \r\n  of the litigation.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œIn every civil action commenced \r\n  or prosecuted in the courts of record in this State . . . the attorneys for \r\n  the plaintiff or defendant shall be entitled to recover costs and disbursements \r\n  of the adverse party.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-37-10 (1977); see Rule 54(d), \r\n  SCRCP (â€œ[C]osts shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless \r\n  the court otherwise directs.â€).Â  However, â€œ[n]o costs will be allowed to any \r\n  party unless he succeed, in whole or in part, in his claim or defense, unless \r\n  otherwise directed by the judge hearing the cause.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-37-20 \r\n  (1977).Â  \r\nInitially, we note, the Buonfortes \r\n  do not argue the special referee lacked authority to award fees and costs.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, the Buonfortes do not argue the special referee awarded fees and \r\n  costs for expenses not provided for by statute.Â  Rather, the Buonfortes only \r\n  argue the special referee abused his discretion by ordering the Buonfortes to \r\n  pay all of the fees and costs of the litigation.\r\nIn an action in equity, the decision \r\n  to grant or deny costs is largely a matter within the sound discretion of the \r\n  trial court.Â  See Cauthen v. Cauthen, 81 S.C. 313, 315, 62 S.E.2d \r\n  319, 320 (1908).Â  Thus, this court will not disturb the decision of the trial \r\n  court absent a clear abuse of discretion.Â  Id.\r\nThe Neighbors sued the Buonfortes, \r\n  seeking to enforce restrictive covenants.Â  Specifically, they sought to have \r\n  the Buonfortes remove both the mother-in-law wing and the garage.Â  The Buonfortes \r\n  answered, seeking to maintain both additions to their house.Â  The special referee \r\n  ordered the Buonfortes to remove the garage.Â  Furthermore, the special referee \r\n  ordered the Buonfortes to remove the front entrance to the mother-in-law wing \r\n  and the gabled front entrance, thus bringing the mother-in-law wing in aesthetic \r\n  alignment with the rest of the neighborhood.Â  \r\nFrom the record before us, we \r\n  conclude the special referee did not commit a clear abuse of discretion by ordering \r\n  the Buonfortes to pay all of the fees and costs of the litigation.Â  Thus, we \r\n  hold the special referee did not err. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the \r\n  order of the special referee is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HOWARD, \r\n  and KITTREDGE, JJ., concurring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-271","title":"Hilton Head Resort v.

\r\n  filed a complaint against both Hilton Head Realty Group and one of the groupâ€™s \r\n  partners, Martin Bergman.Â  A subsequent jury trial resulted in a verdict in \r\n  favor of the Regime in the amount of $1,498,334.36 in actual damages and $375,000 \r\n  in punitive damages.Â  Bergman appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\n FACTS\r\n   In late 1989, Martin Bergman and Robert \r\n    Oâ€™Sickey formed Hilton Head Realty Group to purchase a block of condominium \r\n    units on Hilton Head Island.Â  In October 1989, Bergman and Oâ€™Sickey entered \r\n    into a contract to purchase 140 condo units, operated by the Regime, from \r\n    Mellon Bank.Â  Bergman and Oâ€™Sickey each contributed $50,000, which \r\n    was to be held in escrow by Mellon Bank.Â  After their original plan for financing \r\n    fell through, Bergman and Oâ€™Sickey approached New York attorneys Mark Birnbaum \r\n    and Kenneth Wurman about joining their venture and providing additional capital.Â  \r\n  \r\n  Bergman, Oâ€™Sickey, and Hilton Head Realty as \r\n    one party and Birnbaum and Wurman as the other party entered into a Joint \r\n    Venture Agreement on February 13, 1990.Â  The joint venture was formed to purchase \r\n    twenty condo units every thirty days until all the units were closed.Â  The \r\n    name of the joint venture was to be RICO, Inc.Â  On February 21, 1990, RICO, \r\n    Inc. was incorporated as a South Carolina Corporation.Â Â Â  \r\n  Birnbaum and Wurman arranged for Strom Trust, \r\n    a client of theirs for which Birnbaum served as trustee, to provide financing \r\n    for the first purchase of condominiums.Â  In a document dated February 21, \r\n    1990, Strom Trust and Hilton Head Realty agreed Strom Trust would advance \r\n    $400,000 for the purchase of the first twenty units provided for in the agreement \r\n    with Mellon Bank.Â  \r\n  The condominiums did not sell as quickly as expected.Â  \r\n    Bergman found a buyer for the second set of units who took title to the units \r\n    immediately after the transfer from Mellon Bank to RICO in March 1990.Â  Bergman \r\n    testified that after that transaction, he told the other members of RICO that \r\n    he did not want any further involvement with the venture.Â  To that end, Bergman \r\n    did not make any contribution to the purchase of the third group of twenty \r\n    units.Â  However, he continued writing checks from the RICO account, including \r\n    making payments on the loans he and Oâ€™Sickey obtained to fund the escrow with \r\n    Mellon Bank.Â  On July 27, 1990, RICO secured a $200,000 loan from Stark Leasing, \r\n    another client of Birnbaum and Wurmer, for the purchase of the third set of \r\n    condominiums.Â  \r\n  In October 1990, the Regime filed a lien for \r\n    unpaid assessments on the thirty-five units owned by RICO.Â  On February 22, \r\n    1991, the Regime filed a summons and complaint to foreclose on the units.Â  \r\n    Approximately one year later, on February 25, 1992, the master filed an order \r\n    granting the Regime a judgment against RICO in the amount of $158,066.28 and \r\n    ordering the sale of the units.Â  \r\n  The day after the decree of foreclosure \r\n    was filed, Strom Trust and Stark Leasing each filed to foreclose on their \r\n    mortgages with RICO, naming the Regime as a party.Â  The Regime answered and \r\n    filed a cross-claim against RICO.Â  In May of 1992, the circuit court granted \r\n    Strom Trust and Stark Leasing judgments of foreclosure of the mortgages.Â  \r\n    The Regime filed motions to vacate the foreclosure judgment, challenging the \r\n    relative priority of the mortgages and otherwise challenging the validity \r\n    of the claims of the mortgage holders.Â  On June 29, 1992, RICO filed for voluntary \r\n    bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.Â  The circuit \r\n    court subsequently entered an order vacating the foreclosure judgments of \r\n    Strom Trust and Stark Leasing and declaring the Regime had a first priority.Â  \r\n  \r\n  In May 1995, RICO, Strom Trust, Stark Leasing, \r\n    Wurman, Birnbaum, and the Regime agreed to settle.Â  As part of this settlement, \r\n    Strom Trust and Stark Leasing combined to form StarkStrom, which would own \r\n    all of RICOâ€™s assets, including the remaining twenty-eight condo units in \r\n    the Regime.Â  StarkStrom also agreed to issue a note and first mortgage to \r\n    the Regime for $230,000.Â  There would be no interest calculated on this amount \r\n    as long as StarkStrom did not default and made three payments of $76,667 on \r\n    June 1, 1996, June 1, 1997, and December 31, 1997. \r\n    [1] Â  In the Agreement, the Regime reserved the claims it believed it \r\n    had against Bergman and Oâ€™Sickey.&nbsp; \r\n  In September of 1995, the Regime filed \r\n    an amended answer and cross-claim against Hilton Head Realty, Bergman, and \r\n    Oâ€™Sickey alleging various causes of action, including:Â  violation of the Unfair \r\n    Trade Practices Act, [2]  civil \r\n    conspiracy, Statute of Elizabeth [3]  claims, piercing the corporate \r\n    veil, and liability under the doctrine of joint enterprise.Â  The master-in-equity \r\n    issued an order consolidating all these actions and realigning the parties. \r\n    [4] Â  In response to Bergmanâ€™s motion for a jury trial, the master ruled \r\n    that the equitable causes of action, including piercing the corporate veil, \r\n    would not be tried by the jury.Â  The master then transferred the remaining \r\n    issues to the jury roster in circuit court. \r\n  The case against Bergman was tried in front of \r\n    a jury from April 30, 2001 to May 4, 2001. [5] Â  After the Regime rested its case, the trial \r\n    court granted Bergmanâ€™s directed verdict motion as to the Unfair Trade Practices \r\n    Act cause of action but denied the directed verdict motions as to civil conspiracy \r\n    and joint venture.Â  In addition, the court allowed the Regime to amend its \r\n    complaint to include a cause of action for negligence.Â  \r\n  At the close of trial, but before closing arguments, \r\n    Bergman made a motion â€œfor a directed verdict based on [his] argument made \r\n    at the close of [the Regime]â€™s case.â€Â  This motion was denied.Â  Therefore, \r\n    the jury considered the following causes of action:Â  negligence, civil conspiracy, \r\n    and liability under the doctrine of joint enterprise.Â  The jury returned a \r\n    verdict for the Regime in the amount of $1,498,334.36 in actual damages and \r\n    $375,000 in punitive damages.Â  Bergman filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding \r\n    the verdict (JNOV), or, in the alternative, a motion for a new trial absolute \r\n    or a new trial nisi remittitur.Â  The trial court denied these \r\n    motions.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\n\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMotion to Amend the Pleadings\r\n      Bergman argues the trial court \r\n        erred in allowing the Regime to amend its pleadings to add a cause of \r\n        action for negligence.Â  \r\n      After the trial court denied Bergmanâ€™s motions \r\n        for directed verdict, the Regime moved to amend the pleadings to include \r\n        a cause of action for negligence.Â  Bergmanâ€™s attorney responded:\r\n\r\n      Your Honor, I would oppose such an amendment.Â  We \r\n        have prepared our defense which include[s] the cross examination of the \r\n        plaintiffâ€™s witness and at this late stage an (sic) new cause of action \r\n        really added is inappropriate.Â  And I realize there is a rule allowing \r\n        the plaintiff in some circumstances to amend to conform for the pleadings \r\n        but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s appropriate here.Â  \r\n\r\n      The trial court agreed to allow the amendment, \r\n        but did not state any grounds for its ruling.Â  \r\n      The\r\n      South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provide for the amendment of\r\n      pleadings: \r\n\r\n      When issues not raised by the pleadings are tried \r\n        by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in \r\n        all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.Â  Such amendment \r\n        of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence \r\n        and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any party at any \r\n        time, even after judgment; but failure so to amend does not affect the \r\n        result of the trial of these issues.Â  If evidence is objected to at the \r\n        trial on the ground that it is not within the issues made by the pleadings, \r\n        the court may allow the pleadings to be amended and shall do so freely \r\n        when the presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby \r\n        and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the admission \r\n        of such evidence would prejudice him in maintaining his action or defense \r\n        upon the merits.Â  The court shall upon motion grant a continuance reasonably \r\n        necessary to enable the objecting party to meet such evidence.Â  Upon allowing \r\n        any such amendment or evidence the Court shall state in the record the \r\n        reason or reasons for allowing the amendment or evidence.Â  In the event \r\n        the Court should try issues not raised by the pleadings, it shall state \r\n        in the record all such issues tried and the reason therefor.\r\n\r\n      Rule 15(b), SCRCP.\r\n      â€œMotions to amend pleadings to \r\n        conform to proof may be made upon motion of any party at any time, even \r\n        after judgment . . . .â€Â  Ball v. Canadian Am. Express Co., 314 \r\n        S.C. 272, 275, 442 S.E.2d 620, 622 (Ct. App. 1994).Â Â Â  Generally, amendments \r\n        to conform to proof should be liberally allowed.Â  Pool v. Pool, \r\n        329 S.C. 324, 328, 494 S.E.2d 820, 822 (1998).Â Â  â€œIt is well established \r\n        that a motion to amend is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial \r\n        judge, and that the party opposing the motion has the burden of establishing \r\n        prejudice.â€Â  Foggie v. CSX Transp., Inc., 315 S.C. 17, 23, 431 \r\n        S.E.2d 587, 590 (1993).Â  â€œThe prejudice Rule 15 envisions is a lack of \r\n        notice that the new issue is going to be tried, and a lack of opportunity \r\n        to refute it.â€Â  Pool, 329 S.C. at 328-29, 494 S.E.2d at 823.Â  If \r\n        late amendment of the pleadings would cause prejudice to the opposing \r\n        party, the court should either deny the amendment or grant a continuance \r\n        reasonably necessary to allow the opposing party to meet the amendment.Â  \r\n        Ball, 314 S.C. at 275, 442 S.E.2d at 622. \r\n      Bergman only opposed the amendment \r\n        due to the lateness of the motion rather than the sufficiency of evidence \r\n        to support a cause of action for negligence.Â  That the motion to amend \r\n        came after the Regime rested its case does not prevent the trial judge \r\n        from granting such an amendment.Â  â€œSimply because an amendment to conform \r\n        to proof was made late in the trial affords no basis for holding that \r\n        the amendment comes too late. . . .Â  [T]he question is one of prejudice \r\n        to the opposing party.â€Â  Soil &amp; Material Engâ€™rs, Inc. v. Folly \r\n        Assocs., 293 S.C. 498, 501, 361 S.E.2d 779, 781 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  \r\n      \r\n      On appeal, Bergman argues he was prejudiced \r\n        because he â€œhad absolutely no opportunity to present any evidence as to \r\n        the duties and responsibilities of a corporate officer, had no opportunity \r\n        to present any experts to discuss duties and responsibilities of corporate \r\n        officers, and had no opportunity to show that [his] actions fell within \r\n        the established standard of care.â€Â  Bergman failed to raise these arguments \r\n        as grounds for his opposition to the motion to amend at the time of the \r\n        amendment.Â  Accordingly, these arguments are not properly before this \r\n        court.Â  See Glover v. North Carolina Mut. Life Ins. Co., \r\n        295 S.C. 251, 257, 368 S.E.2d 68, 72 (Ct. App. 1988) (stating this court \r\n        will not reverse a trial courtâ€™s ruling on a motion on a basis not presented \r\n        to the trial court).Â  \r\n      At the time of the motion to amend, Bergman only \r\n        asserted that he would be prejudiced by the amendment because his preparation \r\n        of his defense, including the cross-examination of the Regimeâ€™s witnesses \r\n        would have been different.Â  We find Bergman has failed to demonstrate \r\n        sufficient prejudice for this court to reverse the trial courtâ€™s allowance \r\n        of the amendment.Â  One of the Regimeâ€™s primary witnesses during its case \r\n        was Bergman himself, who testified again during his own case after the \r\n        amendment.Â  Furthermore, at the time of the amendment, Bergman did not \r\n        move for a continuance as is allowed by Rule 15(b), SCRCP.Â  As Bergman \r\n        did not take steps to secure more time in which to prepare a defense for \r\n        the new negligence cause of action, we cannot conclude the trial court \r\n        abused its discretion in finding Bergman was not so prejudiced as to mandate \r\n        denying the amendment.\r\n      Bergman asserts the trial court \r\n        erred in failing to state for the record its reasons for allowing the \r\n        amendment as required by Rule 15 (b), SCRCP.Â  As Bergman failed to object \r\n        to this omission, the issue is not preserved for our review.Â  Wilder \r\n        Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (stating \r\n        that it is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time \r\n        on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge \r\n        to be preserved for appellate review).Â  Similarly, Bergman failed to request \r\n        the court require the Regime to set forth evidence to support its motion.Â  \r\n        He cannot complain about the ambiguity of the motion on appeal.Â  See \r\n        id. Â Bergmanâ€™s inclusion of these arguments in his post-trial motions \r\n        does not preserve them for appeal.Â  See Patterson v. Reid, \r\n        318 S.C. 183, 185, 456 S.E.2d 436, 437 (Ct.App.1995) (â€œA party cannot \r\n        for the first time raise an issue by way of a Rule 59(e) motion which \r\n        could have been raised at trial.â€).\r\n      Accordingly, we affirm the trial \r\n        courtâ€™s grant of the motion to amend the pleadings to include a cause \r\n        of action for negligence.Â  As Bergman does not challenge the sufficiency \r\n        of the evidence to support the cause of action for negligence, we must \r\n        affirm the juryâ€™s verdict in favor of the Regime on this issue.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Civil Conspiracy and Joint Venture\r\nCauses of ActionÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nBergman argues the trial court \r\n        judge erred in denying his motion forÂ  judgment notwithstanding the verdict \r\n        (JNOV) as to the civil conspiracy cause of action.Â  Bergman also argues \r\n        the trial court judge erred in denying his motions for JNOV and a new \r\n        trial absolute as to his liability under the doctrine of joint venture.Â  \r\n        We do not need to reach these arguments under the two-issue rule.Â \r\n      â€œUnder the â€˜two issueâ€™ rule, when \r\n        the jury returns a general verdict involving two or more issues and its \r\n        verdict is supported as to at least one issue, the verdict will not be \r\n        reversed on appeal.â€Â  Anderson v. South Carolina Dep't of Highways \r\n        &amp; Pub. Transp., 322 S.C. 417, 419, 472 S.E.2d 253, 254 (1996). \r\n        The supreme court in Anderson illustrated the â€œtwo issue ruleâ€ \r\n        as follows:\r\n\r\n      [The] two applications of the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule are \r\n        illustrated in the following example:Â  A case is submitted to the jury \r\n        on the issues of defamation and invasion of privacy.Â  The jury returns \r\n        a general verdict for the plaintiff.Â  The defendant appeals, arguing that \r\n        the trial court erred by failing to direct a verdict on the defamation \r\n        issue.Â  Under one application of the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule, an appellate court \r\n        would affirm because defendant has failed to appeal the invasion of privacy \r\n        issue as well.Â  Assuming, however, that the defendant has appealed both \r\n        issues, the appellate court would affirm on the basis of a second application \r\n        of the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule, if either of the two issues supported\r\n      affirmance.&nbsp; \r\n      \r\n\r\n      Id.  at 420, 472 S.E.2d at 254.Â  \r\n      Thus, under this second application of the \r\n        â€œtwo issueâ€ rule, we find it unnecessary to address the issues of civil \r\n        conspiracy and liability under the joint venture doctrine as our ruling \r\n        on the negligence issue requires affirmance of the juryâ€™s general verdict. \r\n        Â \r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMotions for a new trial nisi remittitur or absolute.&nbsp;\r\n    Bergman argues the trial court judge \r\n      erred in denying his motion for a new trial nisi remittitur or new \r\n      trial absolute.Â  We disagree.\r\n     The trial court alone has the power \r\n      to grant a new trial nisi when it finds the amount of the verdict \r\n      to be merely inadequate or excessive.Â  Oâ€™Neal v. Bowles, 314 S.C. \r\n      525, 527, 431 S.E.2d 555, 556 (1993). The denial of a motion for a new trial \r\n      nisi is within the trial courtâ€™s discretion and will not be reversed \r\n      on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Id.Â  On appeal of the denial \r\n      of a motion for a new trial nisi, the appellate courts will reverse \r\n      only when the verdict is grossly inadequate or excessive requiring the granting \r\n      of a new trial absolute.Â  Id.Â  \r\n    The trial courtâ€™s decision to deny \r\n      a motion for new trial absolute is within its discretion and will not be \r\n      reversed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Cock-N-Bull Steak House, Inc. \r\n      v. Generali Ins. Co., 321 S.C. 1, 9, 466 S.E.2d 727, 731 (1996).Â  When \r\n      reviewing the denial of a motion for new trial, the court must look at the \r\n      testimony and inferences raised therefrom in the light most favorable to \r\n      the nonmoving party.Â  Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 302-03, 536 \r\n      S.E.2d 408, 420 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œThe trial court must set aside a verdict \r\n      only when it is shockingly disproportionate to the injuries suffered and \r\n      thus indicates that passion, caprice, prejudice, or other considerations \r\n      not reflected by the evidence affected the amount awarded.â€Â  Id. \r\n      at 302, 536 S.E.2d at 420.Â  A juryâ€™s determination of damages is entitled \r\n      to substantial deference by this court.Â  Knoke v. S.C. Depâ€™t. of Parks, \r\n      Recreation &amp; Tourism, 324 S.C. 136, 141, 478 S.E.2d 256, 258 (1996).Â  \r\n    \r\n    In support of his \r\n      argument that the juryâ€™s verdict was excessive, Bergman raises four issues.Â  \r\n      We find these issues are not properly before this court.Â  Bergman asserts \r\n      the Regime failed to mitigate its damages by selling the foreclosed units \r\n      and that it waived its right to collect the debt from Bergman individually \r\n      by waiving its right to collect from RICO.Â  We find no indication in the \r\n      record that Bergman presented these issues to the jury.Â  See McClary \r\n      v. Massey Ferguson, Inc., 291 S.C. 506, 511, 354 S.E.2d 405, 408 (Ct. \r\n      App. 1987) (stating whether the party acted reasonably to mitigate damages \r\n      is ordinarily a question for the jury); Stovall Bldg. Supplies, Inc. \r\n      v. Mottett, 305 S.C. 28, 35, 406 S.E.2d 176, 180 (Ct. App. 1990) (stating \r\n      the question of waiver is a matter for the jury or fact finder).Â  Bergman \r\n      also argues that the regime fees assessed against RICO after the order of \r\n      foreclosure should be stricken from the damages award.Â  Bergman, however, \r\n      failed to object when the Regime introduced these damages into evidence.Â  \r\n      See Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 307, 486 S.E.2d 750, 759 \r\n      (1997) (a party who fails to object to the admission of evidence when it \r\n      is offered cannot make its admission a ground for appeal).Â Â  \r\n    Finally, Bergman argues that because \r\n      the Regimeâ€™s settlement with StarkStrom impaired the collateral that secured \r\n      the debt, the Regime should be barred from seeking an alternative recovery \r\n      against Appellant.Â  Our review of the record, however, reveals Bergman failed \r\n      to raise this or any of the other above arguments until his motion for a \r\n      new trial.Â  See Patterson v. Reid, 318 S.C. 183, 185, 456 \r\n      S.E.2d 436, 437 (Ct.App.1995) (â€œA party cannot for the first time raise \r\n      an issue by way of a Rule 59(e) motion which could have been raised at trial.â€).Â  \r\n      Accordingly none of these issues are preserved for our review.Â Â  \r\nViewing\r\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the Regime, we\r\nfind the trial court did not err in denying Bergmanâ€™s motion for a new trial.&nbsp;\r\nIn the order denying Bergmanâ€™s post-trial motions, the court found the\r\njuryâ€™s award of damages was not unreasonable.&nbsp;\r\nThe court based this determination on the fact that the jury awarded\r\n$1,498,334.36 in actual damages and the Regime had submitted an exhibit at trial\r\nin which it itemized damages totaling $1,498,334.36.&nbsp;\r\nAfter Bergman waived a procedural objection, this exhibit was admitted\r\ninto evidence without objection.&nbsp; The\r\ntrial court found Bergman had not presented any evidence that the jury was\r\nâ€œcontrolled by corruption, prejudice, passion or caprice.â€&nbsp;\r\nWe agree with the trial judgeâ€™s findings and find there was no abuse of\r\ndiscretion in denying the new trial motion.&nbsp;\r\nThere was sufficient evidence in the record to support the juryâ€™s\r\nverdict â€“ down to the penny â€“ and Bergman failed to show the juryâ€™s\r\nverdict resulted from any kind of improper motive.&nbsp;\r\nAccordingly, we conclude the trial court judge did not err in denying\r\nBergmanâ€™s motions for a new trial nisi remittitur or absolute.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased upon the foregoing, the trial court judgeâ€™s findings are\r\n       AFFIRMED.\r\n      HUFF, STILWELL, and CURETON,\r\n      JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n     \r\n        [1]    StarkStrom made the first payment on June 1, 1996; \r\n        however, the parties agreed to restructure the next two payments and pay \r\n        the amounts in increments until the full amount was paid.Â  \r\n    \r\n     \r\n       \r\n         \r\n        [2]    S.C.

Baker, III, Martha H. Rhodes, Susan Taylor Wall \r\n  and Jenny Anderson Horne, all of Charleston; and Solicitor Warren C. Powell, \r\n  Jr., of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Robert Hoisington appeals an \r\n  order granting summary judgment to Douglas W. MacNeille, Keri A. Jordan, Ruth \r\n  &amp; MacNeille, P.A., William A. Ruth and Michael G. Olivetti (collectively, \r\n  Respondents). Robert argues error by the trial judge in finding that the statute \r\n  of limitations had run prior to the service and filing of his complaint. He \r\n  also contends error in the judgeâ€™s failure to find civil liability on the part \r\n  of respondents and his finding that Jordan and the other respondents had no \r\n  duty to Robert. We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nRobert and Carol Hoisington, although \r\n  never formally married, were deemed in a previous action to have a common law \r\n  marriage. Â They have three children, all boys, currently ages 12, 11, \r\n  and 8.Â  Carol filed for a divorce from Robert in April, 1997.Â  \r\nJordan was an associate in the \r\n  Hilton Head law firm of Ruth &amp; MacNeille, P.A., while Ruth, Olivetti, and \r\n  MacNeille were shareholders of this firm.Â  Jordan was asked by Robertâ€™s and \r\n  Carolâ€™s attorneys to be guardian ad litem (GAL) for their children in their \r\n  divorce action. She was officially appointed to this position on June 13, 1997, \r\n  although she visited the parties in May, and participated at a hearing held \r\n  on June 2 in this capacity.Â  At the June 2 hearing, Robert and Carol reached \r\n  an agreement and consented to Jordanâ€™s recommendation that Carol be granted \r\n  temporary custody, with an obligation on Carolâ€™s part to get substance abuse \r\n  counseling and both parties to undergo drug testing.Â  \r\nIn January 1998, Robert met with Jordan and indicated \r\n  he was concerned about her performance as GAL and the amount of fees she had \r\n  been charging.Â  Robert indicated he had no confidence in Jordan as the GAL, \r\n  and he believed she was not competent to represent his children and she was \r\n  extremely biased.Â  Jordan informed Robert and his attorney that she would consent \r\n  to a motion to have her relieved as GAL.Â  \r\nOn February 5, 1998 Robert received \r\n  an anonymous letter stating the following:\r\n\r\nTo Robert,\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Carol is having an affair with Doug McNeille (sic), \r\n  a married lawyer, for the past four or five months.Â  They have sex at your house \r\n  while your children are there.Â  Prove they are having an affair, and it should \r\n  save you a lot of money in your divorce.Â  Ask your lawyer.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n-An anonymous friend who doesnâ€™t think Carol deserves alimony.\r\n\r\nRobert read the letter and asked someone at work to look at it.Â  That person \r\n  told Robert he had been writing checks to Ruth &amp; MacNeille.Â  Within five \r\n  minutes of reading the letter, Robert realized that the attorney referred to \r\n  in the letter was Jordanâ€™s boss.Â  On February 5, Robert spoke with his attorney \r\n  about the letter and asked him to get a private investigator to look into the \r\n  matter.Â  \r\nOn February 23 or 24, 1998, Robertâ€™s attorney contacted \r\n  Jordan and informed her there was an allegation that MacNeille was having an \r\n  affair with Carol.Â  Subsequent to that conversation, Jordan saw Robertâ€™s attorney \r\n  at the courthouse, at which time he informed her about the anonymous letter.Â  \r\n  Jordan testified, although she knew that MacNeille and Carol were acquainted \r\n  and that Carol visited the law firm office, she thought the visits were part \r\n  of Carolâ€™s association with Dixie Youth baseball.Â  Jordan denied any knowledge \r\n  of the affair prior to the call from Robertâ€™s attorney.Â  Upon learning of the \r\n  allegations, Jordan immediately prepared a notice of motion to be relieved as \r\n  GAL.Â  The motion was dated February 24, 1998, and was filed on February 26, \r\n  1998.Â  A hearing was held on March 17, 1998, at which time both Robertâ€™s and \r\n  Carolâ€™s attorneys consented to the motion.Â  Jordan was thereafter relieved of \r\n  her duties as GAL.Â  \r\nAt a hearing on April 30, 1998 \r\n  a successor GAL was appointed.Â  When asked by the trial judge at the pre-hearing \r\n  conference why she had asked to be relieved, Jordan stated that â€œthere had been \r\n  an allegation made against a shareholder in my firm of some type of a relationship \r\n  with one of the parties.â€Â  \r\nBoth Robert and Carol sought custody of \r\n  their children.Â  In November 1998, the family court determined that Robert and \r\n  Carol had a common law marriage and the divorce action proceeded.Â  In July 1999, \r\n  Robert took Carol and MacNeilleâ€™s depositions.Â  Carol admitted to the affair \r\n  with MacNeille as well as another with her sonâ€™s baseball coach.Â  MacNeille \r\n  invoked the protection of the Fifth Amendment when asked if he had a sexual \r\n  relationship with Carol.Â  The successor GALâ€™s report recommended Robert be given \r\n  custody of the children.Â  In November 2000, the court granted custody of the \r\n  children to Robert.Â  In March 2001, Robert was granted a divorce from Carol \r\n  on the grounds of adultery.Â  \r\nIn August 2001, after Robert filed the current \r\n  action and Carol filed her own, separate action against the respondents, Carol \r\n  testified by way of deposition that her affair with MacNeille usually involved \r\n  MacNeilleâ€™s use of cocaine and marijuana, and that she used cocaine with him \r\n  on one occasion.Â  She further claimed that, during their affair, MacNeille acted \r\n  in many ways like her attorney and spoke about the case to Jordan on at least \r\n  one occasion.Â  \r\nOn February 16, 2001, this action was filed and \r\n  given to the Sheriffâ€™s Office for service on Respondents.Â  The complaint alleged \r\n  malpractice on the part of Jordan arising from the conflict of interest and \r\n  her failure to investigate the allegations or inform the court.Â  It alleged \r\n  negligence on the part of MacNeille for endangering the children and ending \r\n  any chance of reconciliation between Robert and Carol. It also accused the law \r\n  firm of negligent inaction for failing to make efforts to police their members \r\n  and in not reporting MacNeille to the proper authorities.Â  Robert asserted, \r\n  as a direct and proximate result of the respondentsâ€™ negligence, his â€œchildrenâ€™s \r\n  normal development was endangered, his children were put under physical risk \r\n  because their motherâ€™s drug addiction was being fostered, and any possibility \r\n  of reunion between [Robert and Carol] were (sic) diminished.â€Â  He further alleged \r\n  he was required to pay considerable sums in GAL fees [1]  and child support, and was deprived \r\n  of custody of his children while they were put at risk.Â  The trial judge found \r\n  that the action was time barred by the statute of limitations because more than \r\n  three years had passed from Robertâ€™s receipt of the letter alleging the affair \r\n  to the date of filing and service.Â  Alternatively, he found that Jordanâ€™s status \r\n  as GAL made her immune from civil suits relating to the performance of those \r\n  duties, Jordan owed no duty to Robert as the childrenâ€™s father, and that MacNielle \r\n  was not civilly liable because South Carolina no longer recognizes the torts \r\n  of criminal conversation and alienation of affection.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition \r\n  of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€Â  George v. \r\n  Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).Â  When reviewing the \r\n  grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard \r\n  which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP:Â  summary judgment is \r\n  proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving \r\n  party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Ferguson v. Charleston \r\n  Lincoln Mercury, Inc., 349 S.C. 558, 562, 564 S.E.2d 94, 96 (2002).Â  In \r\n  determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all reasonable \r\n  inferences drawn therefrom must be viewed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving \r\n  party.Â  Hendricks v. Clemson University, 353 S.C. 449, 455-56, 578 S.E.2d \r\n  711, 714 (2003).\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Robert does not dispute that the applicable \r\n  limitations period for his claim against respondents is three years.Â  Rather, \r\n  he contends the trial judge erred in finding the statute of limitations barred \r\n  this action because the action was commenced within three years.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530 (Supp. 2003) provides \r\n  a three-year statute of limitations for legal malpractice suits or â€œany injury \r\n  to the person or rights of another, not arising on contract and not enumerated \r\n  by law.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(5) (Supp. 2003);Â  Peterson v. Richland \r\n  County, 335 S.C. 135, 138, 515 S.E.2d 553, 555 (Ct. App. 1999);Â  Berry \r\n  v. McLeod, 328 S.C. 435, 444, 492 S.E.2d 794, 799 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  With \r\n  respect to injuries to the person, the discovery rule provides: â€œExcept as to \r\n  actions initiated under Section 15-3-545 [actions for medical malpractice], \r\n  all actions initiated under Section 15-3-530(5) must be commenced within three \r\n  years after the person knew or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should \r\n  have known that he had a cause of action.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-535 (Supp. \r\n  2003).\r\nâ€œAccording to the discovery rule, the statute of \r\n  limitations begins to run when a cause of action reasonably ought to have been \r\n  discovered.Â  The statute runs from the date the injured party either knows or \r\n  should have known by the exercise of reasonable diligence that a cause of action \r\n  arises from the wrongful conduct.â€Â  Dean v. Ruscon Corp., 321 S.C. 360, \r\n  363, 468 S.E.2d 645, 647 (1996).\r\n\r\nThe exercise of reasonable diligence means simply that an \r\n  injured party must act with some promptness where the facts and circumstances \r\n  of an injury would put a person of common knowledge and experience on notice \r\n  that some right of his has been invaded or that some claim against another party \r\n  might exist.Â  The statute of limitations begins to run from this point and not \r\n  when advice of counsel is sought or a full-blown theory of recovery developed.\r\n\r\nWiggins v. Edwards, 314 S.C. 126, 128, 442 \r\n  S.E.2d 169, 170 (1994) (quoting Snell v. Columbia Gun Exchange, Inc., \r\n  276 S.C. 301, 303, 278 S.E.2d 333, 334 (1981)).Â  The focus date under the discovery \r\n  rule is the date of discovery of the injury and not the date of discovery of \r\n  the wrongdoer.Â  Id. at 128, 442 S.E.2d at 170.\r\n\r\nThe important date under the discovery rule is the date \r\n  that a plaintiff discovers the injury, not the date of the discovery of the \r\n  identity of another alleged wrongdoer.Â  If, on the date of injury, a plaintiff \r\n  knows or should know that [he] had some claim against someone else, the statute \r\n  of limitations begins to run for all claims based on that injury.\r\n\r\nId. (quoting Tollison v. B &amp; J Machinery \r\n  Co., Inc., 812 F.Supp. 618, 620 (D.S.C. 1993)).Â  \r\nThe test of whether or not a person should have \r\n  known the operative facts is objective rather than subjective.Â  Bayle v. \r\n  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 123, 542 S.E.2d 736, 740 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The test is not whether a particular plaintiff actually knew \r\n  he or she had a claim against a party.Â  Id.Â  Rather, the discovery rule \r\n  focuses on whether the plaintiff acquired knowledge of any existing facts sufficient \r\n  to put the party on inquiry.Â  Peterson, 335 S.C. at 139, 515 S.E.2d at \r\n  555.\r\nRobert contends he had no cause of action against \r\n  respondents until Jordan and her firm failed to investigate or report MacNeilleâ€™s \r\n  conduct to the authorities after they were given notice of the allegation of \r\n  the affair on the February 23 or 24, 1998.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIt is clear the injuries Robert alleges all stem \r\n  from the sexual relationship between Carol and MacNeille and the alleged conflict \r\n  of interest that arose therefrom during the time period that Jordan was acting \r\n  as GAL.Â  Jordan denied any knowledge of the affair prior to being contacted \r\n  by Robertâ€™s attorney, and it is undisputed that, recognizing the potential conflict, \r\n  Jordan immediately took steps to have herself relieved as GAL to the children \r\n  once she was informed.Â  Robert had the means of discovering his potential claim \r\n  against the respondents when he received the anonymous letter on February 5, \r\n  1998.Â  On this date, the facts and circumstances put Robert on notice that some \r\n  right of his may have been invaded or that some claim against another party \r\n  might exist.Â  It is irrelevant that Jordan and the law firm may have thereafter \r\n  failed to investigate the allegations, as Robert acquired knowledge of facts \r\n  sufficient to put him on inquiry prior to the time that Jordan received notice \r\n  of the potential conflict of interest.Â  Indeed, Robert stated that at the time \r\n  he received the letter and discovered the connection between Jordan and MacNeille, \r\n  he felt it explained why â€œall these . . . biased things [had] been happening \r\n  to [him]â€ and it â€œstarted making sense of what [had] transpired over the pastâ€ \r\n  and why things had gone â€œheavily toward Carol and heavily against [him].â€Â  Robert \r\n  further admitted, â€œthe machinery to inquire into the Doug MacNeille/Carol Hoisington \r\n  matter was underway on February 5, 1998.â€Â  The fact that an injured party does \r\n  not initially comprehend the full extent of the damages does not prevent the \r\n  proverbial clock from starting at the moment that party is aware of the facts \r\n  that caused the injury.Â  Barr v. City of Rock Hill, 330 S.C. 640, 645, \r\n  500 S.E.2d 157, 160 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Because Robert knew or should have known \r\n  that he had some claim against someone on February 5, 1998 for any injuries \r\n  accompanied by the affair between Carol and MacNeille, the statute of limitations \r\n  began to run at that point for all claims based on that injury. The statute \r\n  of limitations began to run at this time, and not when a full-blown theory of \r\n  recovery was developed by Robert.\r\nFurther, we find our decision in Burgess v. Am. \r\n  Cancer Socâ€™y, 300 S.C. 182, 386 S.E.2d 798 (Ct. App. 1989), remarkably similar \r\n  to the situation in the instant case.Â  In Burgess, the plaintiff was \r\n  fired as executive director of the American Cancer Societyâ€™s local office and \r\n  later sued the society for this termination.Â  Her attorney in the action was \r\n  having an affair during the litigation with the woman who replaced her as the \r\n  director of the organization.Â  The plaintiff learned of the alleged affair, \r\n  and several years later heard that the attorney had passed information regarding \r\n  plaintiffâ€™s lawsuit to the Cancer Society during the litigation.Â  She subsequently \r\n  sued her attorney for malpractice.Â  Stressing that the discovery rule focuses \r\n  upon whether the complaining party acquired knowledge of any existing facts \r\n  that would be sufficient to put the party on inquiry, such that if developed \r\n  would disclose the alleged wrong, the court held that the statute of limitations \r\n  began to accrue when the plaintiff learned of the affair, not when she learned \r\n  of the communications giving rise to the alleged malpractice.Â  Burgess, \r\n  300 S.C. at 186-87, 386 S.E.2d at 800-01.Â  Thus, the suit was barred pursuant \r\n  to the statute of limitations.\r\nIt is undisputed that on February 5, 1998 Robert learned \r\n  of the alleged affair which, as in Burgess, was very likely to lead to \r\n  some kind of conflict on the part of Respondents concerning the handling of \r\n  his legal matter.Â  Per the discovery rule, the statute of limitations began \r\n  to accrue at this time.Â  Because the current action was initiated more than \r\n  three years after this date, it is time barred by the statute of limitations \r\n  as a matter of law. [2] \r\nFor the forgoing reasons, the decision of the trial \r\n  court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ. and CURETON, AJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Approximately \r\n    one month after Robert filed this action, Carol was ordered to reimburse Robert \r\n    for the $7,000 in GAL fees he paid to Jordan.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] In \r\n    light of our determination that this action is barred by the statute of limitations, \r\n    we need not reach Robertâ€™s remaining issues on appeal.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-275","title":"State v.

Victor Rawl, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-276\r\nHeard April 6, 2004 â€“ Filed April 22, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nPatrick W. Carr, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nAkim A. Anastopoulo, Constance A. Anastopoulo and Eric S. Brock, all of Charleston, \r\n  for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this negligence case, Kimberly \r\n  Eve Miller (Appellant) appeals from an order of the circuit court granting summary \r\n  judgment to Josephine Washington and Annie Brown (collectively, Respondents) \r\n  as to both negligence and proximate cause, while leaving the determination of \r\n  the amount of damages to the jury.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and \r\n  remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nThis case arises from an automobile \r\n  accident which occurred on May 4, 2001, between Appellant and Respondent Josephine \r\n  Washington.Â  Respondent Washingtonâ€™s mother, Annie Brown, was a passenger in \r\n  her daughterâ€™s car, which was being driven in the left hand lane.Â  Appellant \r\n  changed from the middle lane to the left lane so that she would be in position \r\n  to make a left hand turn.Â  Prior to changing lanes, Appellant checked her side \r\n  mirror, but did not realize how close the Respondentsâ€™ car was to Appellantâ€™s \r\n  vehicle.Â  As a result, Appellant struck the Respondentsâ€™ car.\r\nDuring her deposition, the Appellant \r\n  was asked: â€œDo you believe sitting here today that you could have avoided this \r\n  accident?â€Â  Appellant answered: â€œI think â€“ yes, yes, I think that if I had realized \r\n  that I didnâ€™t have enough space to get over, then I would have not tried to \r\n  go over in her lane.â€Â  Based on this admission and affidavits from a physician \r\n  that the Respondentsâ€™ injuries were proximately caused by the accident, the \r\n  Respondents moved for summary judgment.Â  Appellant did not submit any affidavits \r\n  at the summary judgment hearing regarding duty, breach, or proximate cause.Â  \r\n  Instead, Appellant relied on the denials and defenses found in the pleadings.\r\nThe circuit court granted summary judgment as to \r\n  duty, breach, and proximate cause, leaving the determination of the amount of \r\n  damages to the jury.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings, \r\n  depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with \r\n  the affidavits, if any, show there is no genuine issue as to any material fact \r\n  and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  Hansen \r\n  ex rel. Hansen v. United Servs. Auto. Assâ€™n, 350 S.C. 62, 67, 565 S.E.2d \r\n  114, 116&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002) (citing Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Tupper v. Dorchester \r\n  County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997)).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Summary Judgment as to \r\n  Liability\r\nIn a claim of negligence, the \r\n  plaintiff must show the: (1) defendant owes a duty of care to the plaintiff; \r\n  (2) defendant breached the duty by a negligent act or omission; (3) defendantâ€™s \r\n  breach was the actual and proximate cause of the plaintiffâ€™s injury; and (4) \r\n  plaintiff suffered an injury or damages.Â  Andrade v. Johnson,&nbsp;356 \r\n  S.C. 238, 245, 588 S.E.2d 588, 592&nbsp;(2003).Â  In this case, the Respondents \r\n  presented Appellantâ€™s deposition testimony admitting she could have avoided \r\n  the accident if she had realized that she did not have enough space to change \r\n  lanes without striking the Respondentsâ€™ vehicle.Â  Appellant did not file any \r\n  counter-affidavits or introduce any deposition testimony. \r\n  [1] Â  South Carolina law requires that: \r\n\r\nWhere the plaintiff relies solely \r\n  upon the pleadings, files no counter-affidavits, and makes no factual showing \r\n  in opposition to a motion for summary judgment, the lower court is required \r\n  under Rule 56, to grant summary judgment, if, under the facts presented by the \r\n  defendant, he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. . . .\r\n\r\nHumana Hospital-Bayside v. \r\n  Lightle, 305 S.C. 214, 216, 407 S.E.2d 637, 638 (1991).\r\nAppellant argues that because \r\n  her deposition contains statements that she had turned on her left-hand turn \r\n  signal and checked for other cars using the mirror and looking over her shoulder, \r\n  an issue of comparative negligence has been created.Â  This argument is not compelling \r\n  in light of Appellantâ€™s admission that she breached her duty to yield to the \r\n  favored driver before switching lanes.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-1900(a) \r\n  (1991).Â  While courts should be reticent to endorse summary judgments in cases \r\n  involving comparative negligence, this reticence does not mean that simply pleading \r\n  comparative negligence will operate as a bar to summary judgment.Â  Cf. Thomasko \r\n  v. Poole, 349 S.C. 7, 12, 561 S.E.2d 597, 599 (2002) (stating that â€œ[i]n \r\n  a comparative negligence case, the trial court should grant the [directed verdict] \r\n  motion if the sole reasonable inference from the evidence is the non-moving \r\n  partyâ€™s negligence exceeded fifty percent.â€).Â  In this case, because of Appellantâ€™s \r\n  admission, the sole reasonable inference is that Appellantâ€™s negligence caused \r\n  the accident.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court properly granted summary judgment \r\n  after considering the admission in the deposition and the lack of opposition \r\n  by Appellant.\r\n2.Â  Summary Judgment as to \r\n  Proximate Cause\r\nDespite the grant of summary \r\n  judgment regarding liability, the Respondents are not relieved of their responsibility \r\n  to prove that Appellantâ€™s breach was the actual and proximate cause of the Respondentsâ€™ \r\n  injuries.Â  See Andrade v. Johnson,&nbsp;356 S.C. 238, 245, 588 \r\n  S.E.2d 588, 592&nbsp;(2003).Â  A physicianâ€™s affidavit stating that â€œin [his] \r\n  professional opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty most probably, \r\n  [the Respondentsâ€™] injuries . . . were a proximate result of the injuries [they] \r\n  sustained in the automobile accidentâ€ does not foreclose a juryâ€™s opportunity \r\n  to measure the credibility of the evidence as to proximate cause.Â  â€œThe fact \r\n  that testimony is not contradicted directly does not render it undisputed.Â  \r\n  There remains the question of the inherent probability of the testimony and \r\n  the credibility of the witness or the interests of the witness in the result \r\n  of the litigation.â€Â  Black v. Hodge, 306 S.C. 196, 198, 410 S.E.2d 595, \r\n  596 (Ct. App. 1991) (citation omitted).\r\nIn contrast to the physicianâ€™s \r\n  affidavit, the following facts exist: (1) the Respondents refused medical treatment \r\n  at the scene of the accident; (2) the automobile air bags did not deploy; and \r\n  (3) the Respondentsâ€™ car was driven away from the scene of the accident.\r\nâ€œIn determining whether any triable \r\n  issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably \r\n  drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving \r\n  party.â€Â  Summer v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 42, 492 S.E.2d 55, 58 &nbsp;(1997).Â  \r\n  Taking the deposition testimony in the light most favorable to Appellant, inferences \r\n  could be drawn that this was a minor accident that would not normally cause \r\n  injury to the Respondents.Â  In light of these facts, a determination about the \r\n  extent to which the accident did or did not cause injuries should be left to \r\n  a jury.Â  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment as to proximate \r\n  cause is reversed.\r\nIn light of our ruling as to \r\n  proximate cause, it is not necessary to address Appellantâ€™s allegation that \r\n  the circuit court improperly considered Appellantâ€™s payment to Respondent Washington \r\n  in settlement of property damage.Â  Additionally, the verdict form ordered by \r\n  the circuit court is no longer appropriate as it required the jury to return \r\n  a monetary verdict for the Respondents.Â  This Court would suggest that the appropriate \r\n  verdict form to be used is one that offers two choices for each of the Respondents: \r\n  (1) â€œWe, the jury, find for the Plaintiff in the amount ofÂ  ______ actual damagesâ€; \r\n  and (2) â€œWe, the jury, find for the Defendant.â€\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, \r\n  based on the foregoing reasons, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED \r\n  IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., ANDERSON, and \r\n  BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Appellant stated the deposition of the investigating officer had \r\n    been scheduled for the week following the summary judgment hearing.Â  However, \r\n    the deposition statement by Appellant is a clear admission that could not \r\n    be refuted by the limited testimony of an investigating officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-277","title":"Sloan v.

Carpenter and Jennifer \r\n  J. Miller, both of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nThomas H. Coker and Boyd B. Nicholson, Jr., both of Greenville, \r\n  for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Edward D. Sloan, Jr., suing \r\n  as a taxpayer and citizen of Greenville County, brought this action challenging \r\n  the sufficiency of a written determination by the county for the procurement \r\n  of design-build services for the countyâ€™s 2001-2002 Roads Paving Program.Â  Sloan \r\n  alleged that the countyâ€™s written determination was insufficient and, was therefore \r\n  â€œarbitrary, capricious, ultra vires and an abuse of discretion.â€Â  \r\n  He appeals the ruling of the trial court, finding the determination was sufficient, \r\n  granting judgment to the County, and dismissing the case with prejudice.Â  We \r\n  affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe Greenville County Code \r\n  (â€œG.C.C.â€ or â€œthe Codeâ€) prescribes the methods the County may use in awarding \r\n  contracts for construction services.Â  Generally, under the Code, the County \r\n  must procure construction services that exceed $15,000 through the competitive \r\n  sealed biding (â€œCSBâ€) process.Â  G.C.C. Â§ 7-213.Â  However, the County may forego \r\n  the CSB method and utilize an alternative procurement and construction method \r\n  if one of several exceptions set out in the code applies.Â  One of these alternative \r\n  methods is the â€œdesign-build services, turnkey management services, or construction \r\n  management servicesâ€ method (hereinafter collectively referred to as â€œdesign-build \r\n  servicesâ€).Â  Specifically, Greenville County Code Â§ 7-212 provides in pertinent \r\n  part as follows: \r\n\r\nUnless otherwise required \r\n  by law, all county contracts shall be awarded by competitive sealed bidding, \r\n  pursuant to section 7-213 (competitive sealed bidding), except as provided in:\r\n. . . \r\n(10) Section [7-242.5] \r\n  [1]  (design-build services, turnkey management services, or construction \r\n  management services).\r\n\r\nG.C.C. Â§ 7-212.Â  The Code defines these services as â€œapproaches \r\n  to construction contract management that allow for the selection of a single \r\n  firm to perform and/or manage the complete design and construction of a project.â€Â  \r\n  G.C.C. Â§ 7-198.Â  \r\nGreenville County Code Â§ 7-242.5 sets out the guidelines \r\n  that the county administrator shall follow when exercising his discretionary \r\n  right to utilize the design-build construction method in lieu of the CSB method.Â  \r\n  The administrator is to consider the method which, in his or her discretion, \r\n  is â€œthe most advantageous to the county and will result in the most timely, \r\n  economical and successful completion of the construction project.â€Â  This determination \r\n  must be stated in writing and included as a part of the contract file.Â  G.C.C. \r\n  Â§ 7-242.5(a). [2] Â  If the county administrator determines use \r\n  of design-build services is most advantageous, and the project exceeds $5 million, \r\n  the administratorâ€™s written determination must be submitted for review to the \r\n  county councilâ€™s committee of the whole.Â  Notice of review must be presented \r\n  to the public, and an interested party has fifteen days to submit written comments \r\n  to the committee of the whole.Â  At the next committee meeting, members of the \r\n  public who submitted written comments may address the committee.Â  Following \r\n  comments, County Council may reject the design-build method.Â  If County Council \r\n  does not vote to reject the design-build method, the project goes forward.Â  \r\n  G.C.C. Â§ 7-242.5(b).Â  \r\nIn October 2001, the county administrator of Greenville County \r\n  made a written determination to use design-build service for the Countyâ€™s 2001-2002 \r\n  Roads Project. This determination called for the procurement of these services \r\n  through the competitive sealed proposal (CSP) method.Â  The County gave public \r\n  notice of the determination, inviting the public to make comment upon it.Â  The \r\n  administrator submitted the determination to county council at its committee \r\n  of the whole meeting and council did not reject the proposal.Â  Following a selection \r\n  process pursuant to G.C.C. Â§ 7-215, governing the CSP method, the County entered \r\n  into a contract with a contractor for the performance of the project.Â  \r\nIn November 2001, Sloan filed a summons and complaint challenging \r\n  the sufficiency of the determination and seeking declaratory and injunctive \r\n  relief.Â  While admitting that the County had prepared a written determination, \r\n  Sloan alleged that the County â€œfailed to include sufficient facts and rationale \r\n  based on those stated facts to justify an exception to competitive sealed bidding.â€Â  \r\n  Thus, he alleged that the determination was â€œarbitrary, capricious, ultra \r\n  vires and an abuse of discretion.â€Â  \r\nThe trial judge held that Sloan had â€œutterly failed to meet \r\n  his burden of proof on [the] claim.â€Â  Instead of concluding that the document \r\n  arbitrarily triggered the exception, the trial judge found that the written \r\n  determination contained several well-reasoned conclusions supported by empirical \r\n  data and prior County experience to support the county administratorâ€™s decision \r\n  to use the design-build/CSP method.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nThe action before us now is nearly identical to a suit recently \r\n  ruled on by this Court concerning the same parties of the present case.Â  The \r\n  current case differs from the previous suit, also brought by Sloan against Greenville \r\n  County, only in that it challenges a different written determination for use \r\n  of the design-build/CSP method than the three determinations in prior years \r\n  challenged by the previous case.Â  Sloan v. Greenville County, 356 S.C. \r\n  531, 590 S.E.2d 338 (Ct. App. 2003) (hereinafter â€œSloan Iâ€).Â  As in the \r\n  previous case, the primary issue here is the validity of the Countyâ€™s determination \r\n  to use design-build/CSP source selection instead of competitive sealed bidding.Â  \r\n  Since the present action was brought before the filing of the first caseâ€™s opinion, \r\n  several issues extensively discussed and conclusively determined by the prior \r\n  case are raised again here.Â  As such, we give these matters only a cursory treatment \r\n  here and focus instead on the sufficiency of the particular written determination \r\n  at issue in this case.\r\nI.Â  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAs in Sloan I, Sloan contends this is an action in \r\n  equity such that this court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with \r\n  our own view of the preponderance of the evidence. \r\n  [3] Â  The county argues this action is one at law and this court should, \r\n  accordingly, apply an â€œany evidenceâ€ standard of review. \r\n  [4] Â  We agree with Sloan that this action is properly characterized as \r\n  one in equity, and we should therefore apply the preponderance of the evidence \r\n  standard of review.\r\nIn Sloan I, after considering that the main purpose \r\n  of the suit was to enjoin the County from awarding contracts in a manner which \r\n  Sloan claims is ultra vires under Greenville Countyâ€™s procurement \r\n  code, and the fact that Sloan did not seek monetary damages, but instead sought \r\n  a judgment to prevent the County from awarding future public works contracts \r\n  in the manner employed, we held this type of action is appropriately characterized \r\n  as equitable, and should be reviewed under the preponderance of the evidence \r\n  standard.Â  We further noted, however, that under this broad scope of review, \r\n  we are not required to disregard the findings of the trial judge.Â  Id. \r\n  at 544-46, 590 S.E.2d at 345-46.\r\nII.Â  JUSTICIABILITY \r\n  OF SLOANâ€™S CLAIMS\r\nGreenville County contends that this case is not properly \r\n  justiciable because Sloan lacks standing to challenge the Countyâ€™s contract \r\n  awards.Â  This same issue was raised in Sloan I.Â  There we noted, while \r\n  generally a taxpayer may not maintain a suit to enjoin the action of State officers \r\n  when he has no special interest and his only standing is the exceedingly small \r\n  interest of a general taxpayer, the rules of standing are flexible, and one \r\n  may assert taxpayer standing if he demonstrates some overriding public purpose \r\n  or concern to confer standing to sue on behalf of his fellow taxpayers.Â  Id. \r\n  at 548-49, 590 S.E.2d at 347.\r\nAs in Sloan I, we find Sloan has standing \r\n  in this case.Â  He has the same interest as a taxpayer in how public funds were \r\n  spent on large projects requiring the expenditure of millions of taxpayer dollars, \r\n  this burden was borne exclusively by the taxpaying citizens of Greenville County, \r\n  and Sloan therefore had a real, material, and substantial interest in whether \r\n  the County properly followed the procurement procedures set out in the county \r\n  code.Â  Id. at 551, 590 S.E.2d at 349.Â  The issue in the present case \r\n  is also of sufficient public importance to confer taxpayer standing.Â  See \r\n  Id. at 551, 590 S.E.2d at 349 (finding taxpayer â€œpublic importanceâ€ standing \r\n  in similar case involving issue of competitive bidding procurement because â€œpublic \r\n  entities must be accountable under the laws and regulations which govern how \r\n  they spend public moneyâ€). For these reasons, we conclude that the trial court \r\n  correctly determined Sloan had standing to pursue this declaratory judgment \r\n  action.\r\nIII. ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE REGARDING THE WRITTEN DETERMINATIONS\r\nSloan argues the trial court erred by allowing \r\n  the county to present evidence regarding the written determinations for the \r\n  use of the design-build/CSP method of source selection.Â  He contends that since \r\n  the trial court was seeking to determine the sufficiency of a written determination, \r\n  its inquiry should be limited to the facts contained within the four corners \r\n  of that writing.Â  We disagree.\r\nAgain, this issue was decided under a nearly identical \r\n  factual scenario in the Sloan I decision.Â  As in Sloan I, the \r\n  testimony in question in this case extended beyond the confines of the written \r\n  determinations that were submitted to County Council.Â  Sloan I, 356 S.C. \r\n  at 560-62, 590 S.E.2d at 354-55.Â  As we did in the prior case, we find that \r\n  this evidence was material and probative to the trial courtâ€™s inquiry into the \r\n  sufficiency of the written determination, and its admission was proper in order \r\n  to educate the court, as the finder of fact, of the surrounding circumstances \r\n  and â€œfill in the gapsâ€ so that the court might have a better understanding.Â  \r\n  Id. at 562, 590 S.E.2d at 355.Â  Just as in Sloan I, Sloanâ€™s reliance \r\n  here on Piedmont Natural Gas Co. v. Hamm, 301 S.C. 50, 389 S.E.2d 655 \r\n  (1990), and Parker v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 288 S.C. 304, \r\n  342 S.E.2d 403 (1986), is misguided, for â€œ[b]oth Piedmont Natural Gas \r\n  and Parker stand for the rule that after a case has been remanded by \r\n  an appellate court, a party cannot submit additional evidence unless the appellate \r\n  court has given leave to do so.â€ Id. at 562, 590 S.E.2d at 354.Â  The \r\n  present case does not concern the admission of additional evidence upon remand \r\n  from appeal, but the trial courtâ€™s initial consideration of evidence at trial.Â  \r\n  As such, the cases cited by Sloan are not applicable to this analysis.Â  \r\nIV.Â  SUFFICIENCY OF THE WRITTEN DETERMINATION\r\nHaving found Sloanâ€™s claims to be properly reviewable \r\n  by this court and the disputed testimony to be properly admitted at trial, we \r\n  now review whether the written determination published by the County is sufficient \r\n  under the Greenville County Code and this Courtâ€™s prior decision in Sloan \r\n  I. \r\nThe Greenville County Code grants the County the \r\n  discretionary power to use design-build/CSP source selection rather than the \r\n  traditional CSB method.Â  County Code Â§ 7-242.5(a).Â  A discretionary decision \r\n  of a legislative body should not be upset on appeal unless such determination \r\n  is â€œarbitrary, unreasonable, in obvious abuse of discretion, or in excess of \r\n  lawfully delegated power.â€Â  Sloan I, 356 S.C. at 555-56, 590 S.E.2d at \r\n  351; Smith v. Georgetown County Council, 292 S.C. 235, 238, 355 S.E.2d \r\n  864, 866 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Since the use of the design-build method may raise \r\n  concerns among citizens of the County, [5]  it is limited under the Code \r\n  to those situations in which it is properly justified.Â  In justifying the exercise \r\n  of this discretionary power, the county administrator or his designee must consider \r\n  â€œthe method which in [his or his designeeâ€™s] discretion is the most advantageous \r\n  to the county and will result in the most timely, economical, and successful \r\n  completion of the construction project.â€Â  G.C.C. Â§ 7-242.5(a).Â  Additionally, \r\n  the determination of this method of source selection must be stated in writing \r\n  and included in the contract file.Â  Id.  \r\nConsidering the underlying legislative intent and guiding \r\n  policies of the Greenville County Code, this Court has held that a written determination, \r\n  required by section 7-242.5, must serve the following dual function:\r\n\r\nThe determination must first effectively inform county council \r\n  of the reasons why design-build source selection works to the Countyâ€™s best \r\n  advantage for the project at issue.Â  Equally important, the determination must \r\n  provide the citizens of Greenville County a window into the Countyâ€™s decision-making \r\n  process--safeguarding the quality and integrity of the contract awards through \r\n  public accountability.Â  \r\n\r\nSloan I, 356 S.C. at 556, 590 S.E.2d at 351-52.Â  â€œIf \r\n  the written determination provides sufficient factual grounds and reasoning \r\n  for the County Council and the public to make an informed, objective review \r\n  of these decisions, then it has accomplished its purpose.â€Â  Id. at 556, \r\n  590 S.E.2d at 352.Â  In other words, if County Council and the public can look \r\n  to the written determination and comprehend the Countyâ€™s rationale in utilizing \r\n  the design-build method as arguably the most timely, economical, and potentially \r\n  successful option, then the determination is sufficient.\r\nThe written determination to use design-build source \r\n  selection for the Roads 2001-2002 project was prepared by Greenville County \r\n  Administrator Steven Stewart.Â  Like the prior yearsâ€™ projects at issue in Sloan \r\n  I, Stewartâ€™s determination addresses County Councilâ€™s time, budget, and \r\n  quality requirements and sets forth the project-specific reasons why design-build \r\n  rather than traditional competitive sealed bidding procurement serves to better \r\n  meet the Countyâ€™s goals.Â  See Sloan I, 356 S.C. at 557, 590 S.E.2d \r\n  at 352.\r\nStewartâ€™s written determination first addresses \r\n  the underlying plan of the County behind this particular project, an expedited \r\n  road-paving plan meant to improve County roads by the year 2010 (the â€œPrescription \r\n  for Progress, Paving County Roadsâ€ program).Â  He also noted that the 2001-2002 \r\n  Road Improvement Program outweighed the capacity of the current staff. Considering \r\n  the one-year timeframe for completion of the project and the limited staff available, \r\n  Stewart concluded the design-build/CSP method would best address the road programâ€™s \r\n  needs, while maintaining the quality level of other county services.Â  Stewart \r\n  also cited the success of past design-build/CSP county projects, including previous \r\n  â€œPrescription for Progressâ€ road projects, for the proposition that the design-build \r\n  method could again be successfully utilized by the County.Â  The determination \r\n  continues by pointing out how the design-build method, as opposed to the traditional \r\n  CSB method, would be particularly advantageous to the County in this specific \r\n  large scope project.Â  It speaks to one of the goals being to ensure the roads \r\n  are â€œbuilt and maintained in such a manner to maximize life expectancy and riding \r\n  surface condition.â€Â  It notes that, under the current process of public/private \r\n  partnership, the strain on County staff is alleviated, and the County can provide \r\n  a full time inspector to travel the roads and insure proper inspection procedures \r\n  are being followed.Â  Further, the determination states that, due to staffing \r\n  requirements, it would cost the County an extra $1,075,000 should the design-build/CSP \r\n  method not be used.Â  It also indicates that utilization of an alternative method \r\n  (such as CSB) would mean the project would take at least one additional year \r\n  to complete compared to the design-build method.Â  These assertions go directly \r\n  to the frugality, timeliness and quality of the design-build method as opposed \r\n  to the traditional CSB method in this particular project.\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find this determination \r\n  provided ample grounds to support County Councilâ€™s decision to approve use of \r\n  the design-build method.Â  Since it addressed the specific needs of the project \r\n  and weighed alternative methods for procuring construction services, the determination \r\n  provided County Council and members of the public â€œclear insight into the rationale \r\n  underlying its decision to use [the] design-build [method].â€Â  Sloan, \r\n  356 S.C. at 558, 590 S.E.2d at 352.Â  Accordingly, the trial court properly ruled \r\n  this determination was sufficient under Â§ 7-242.5 of the Greenville County Code.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court \r\n  is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n GOOLSBY, HUFF, and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] The \r\n    Code references Â§ 7-236 within Â§ 7-212(10), but this is apparently a scriveners \r\n    error and the parties agree the section should reference Â§ 7-242.5 instead.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] The \r\n    portion of Greenville County Code Â§ 7-242.5 most at issue reads as follows:\r\n  (a) The county administrator \r\n    or his designee shall have the discretion to use construction management services, \r\n    design-build services, or turnkey management services as alternatives for \r\n    construction contracting administration.Â  In exercising such discretion, the \r\n    county administrator or his designee shall consider the method which in the \r\n    administrator or his designeeâ€™s discretion is the most advantageous to the \r\n    county and will result in the most timely, economical, and successful completion \r\n    of the construction project.Â  The determination of the method of source selection \r\n    utilized shall be stated in writing and included as part of the contract file.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] In \r\n    an action in equity, tried by a judge alone, without a reference, on appeal \r\n    the appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its \r\n    own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. \r\n    City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] In \r\n    an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of \r\n    fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without \r\n    evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.Â  Townes Assocs., \r\n    Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  See Sloan I, 356 S.C. at 541, 590 \r\n    S.E2d at 344 (â€œIt is [the] design-build [method]â€™s lack of objective, bright-line \r\n    criteria that raises concerns about its use. . . .

Dodds, III, of Mount Pleasant, for Appellants.\r\nDennis E. O'Neill, of Mount Pleasant, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Dr. John Y. Dong a/k/a Dr. \r\n  Jianyun Y. Dong and his wife, Dr. Danher Dong a/k/a Dr. Danher W. Wang (â€œAppellantsâ€) \r\n  [1] , appeal the masterâ€™s rulings in favor of Beachside Real Estate, Inc. \r\n  (â€œRespondentâ€) in this breach of contract action.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [2] \r\nFACTS\r\nOn or about May 26, 2000, Dr. Dong \r\n  phoned Dick Hargett, a real estate agent for Respondent, to inquire about certain \r\n  parcels of real property located in the Victory Point neighborhood in Charleston, \r\n  South Carolina.Â  Appellants met with Mr. Hargett on May 27, 2000 to view the \r\n  properties.Â  Finding a parcel of property to their liking, Appellants decided \r\n  to place an offer.\r\nPrior to placing the offer, on that same day, May \r\n  27, 2000, Mr. Hargett asked Appellants to sign an Acknowledgment of Relationship \r\n  Disclosure form.Â  This document identified Appellants as Buyers and acknowledged \r\n  that Beachside Real Estate and Mr. Hargett were Appellantsâ€™ agents.Â  Also on \r\n  May 27, 2000, Appellants signed an Exclusive Buyer Agency Agreement with Beachside \r\n  Real Estate and Mr. Hargett which provided that, should their offer be accepted, \r\n  Mr. Hargettâ€™s commission would be paid completely by the listing broker.Â  Mr. \r\n  Hargett testified that he fully explained both forms to Appellants and particularly \r\n  how the listing broker would pay his commission.Â  However, after placing the \r\n  offer, Appellants were informed the piece of property was no longer available.\r\nDue to the unavailability of their first \r\n  choice, Appellants soon expressed an interest in another parcel of property \r\n  located in the same neighborhood. \r\n  [3] Â  Unlike the prior property in which Appellants expressed interest, \r\n  this property was not listed in the Multiple Listing Service.Â  Instead, the \r\n  owners were selling the property through an independent real estate agent.Â  \r\n  Mr. Hargett explained to the Appellants that the significance of this difference \r\n  was that the sellers would not be paying his commission and accordingly, the \r\n  buyers would have to pay the commission.\r\nAccordingly, on May 31, 2000, Mr. Hargett \r\n  prepared another Exclusive Buyer Agency Agreement (â€œthe Agreementâ€) which provided \r\n  that the buyer agreed to pay the broker (Mr. Hargett) five percent of the sales \r\n  price upon successful negotiation of a contract on the property.Â  Mr. Hargett \r\n  testified that on June 1, 2000, he delivered the Agreement to Appellantâ€™s office, \r\n  but due to the fact that Dr. Dong was out of town, Dr. Wang was the only person \r\n  to sign the form.\r\nAfter execution of the Agreement, Dr. \r\n  Wang submitted an offer to purchase the property for $350,000.Â  This offer listed \r\n  Beachside Real Estate as the cooperating broker.Â  The owner did not accept this \r\n  offer, and Mr. Hargett prepared a second offer of $353,000 on June 2, 2000.Â  \r\n  In contrast to the first offer, both Dr. Dong and Dr. Wang signed the second \r\n  offer, which also listed Beachside Real Estate as the cooperating broker.Â  Both \r\n  offers were also contingent on Appellants getting approval to install a dock \r\n  on the property. [4] Â  Â Â \r\n&nbsp;Again, the owner of the property did not \r\n  accept Appellantsâ€™ offer.Â  Mr. Hargett contacted the ownerâ€™s agent on numerous \r\n  occasions in an effort to get the asking price lowered.Â  After receiving a counteroffer \r\n  from the owner of $360,000, Dr. Dong expressed concern that he would not be \r\n  able to pay that asking price along with Mr. Hargettâ€™s commission.Â  As such, \r\n  Mr. Hargett got the impression Appellants were going to look at other properties.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, Mr. Hargett and Appellants looked at properties in several other \r\n  locations, but no offers on any of the properties were made through Mr. Hargett \r\n  or Beachside Real Estate. \r\nOn June 27, 2000, Dr. Dong received a \r\n  fax from the ownerâ€™s agent offering to sell the property for $360,000 if the \r\n  decision was made that day, earnest money of $20,000 was paid, and the deal \r\n  closed by August 15, 2000.Â  Dr. Dong accepted the offer the same day by writing \r\n  â€œagreedâ€ on the fax and signing his name.Â  Also on June 27, 2000, both Dr. Dong \r\n  and Dr. Wang entered into a contract to purchase the property per the ownerâ€™s \r\n  proposal for $360,000.Â  Shortly thereafter, Dr. Dong contacted Carolina First \r\n  Bank about obtaining a loan to pay for the property.\r\nHaving obtained loan approval, Appellants sought an \r\n  attorney to handle the real estate closing.Â  Appellants first contacted attorney \r\n  Robert W. Haines.Â  Upon learning of Appellantsâ€™ intention to close with Mr. \r\n  Haines, Mr. Hargett wrote a letter to both Mr. Haines and Appellants.Â  The letter \r\n  stated that Appellants owed him a commission of $18,000.00 and included all \r\n  paperwork executed by the Appellants.Â  Knowing Dr. Dong would not agree to pay \r\n  the commission, Mr. Haines asked Appellants to escrow the commission so that \r\n  the dispute could be resolved through other channels.Â  Unable to convince Appellants \r\n  to pay the commission or escrow the disputed amount, Mr. Haines terminated his \r\n  representation.\r\nAppellants then contacted attorney Amy Campbell in \r\n  an attempt to complete the closing.Â  After discovering that Ms. Campbell was \r\n  going to perform Appellantsâ€™ closing, Mr. Hargett provided her with a copy of \r\n  the Agreement as well.Â  Like Mr. Haines, after receiving this information, Ms. \r\n  Campbell refused to perform the closing.\r\nAppellants were finally able to complete the closing \r\n  by contacting attorney C.J. Manos.Â  Because Mr. Manos was unknown to Mr. Hargett, \r\n  he never became aware of the Agreement or that a commission was being claimed \r\n  on the purchase of the property.  [5] Â  As such, Appellants were able \r\n  to complete the closing.Â  Significantly, title to the property was placed in \r\n  Dr. Dongâ€™s name only.Â  \r\nOn December 6, 2000, Respondent commenced the current \r\n  action alleging breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith \r\n  and fair dealing, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, and civil \r\n  conspiracy.Â  Appellants answered averring several defenses, including violation \r\n  of section 40-57-135(D) of the South Carolina Code.Â  Appellants also asserted \r\n  a number of counterclaims, including breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and fraudulent \r\n  concealment.\r\nThe case was tried before a master-in-equity on September \r\n  18, 2002.Â  On October 1, 2002, the master issued his order finding in favor \r\n  of Respondent.Â  The master held inter alia that the Agreement \r\n  met all of the statutory requirements necessary to be a proper buyer representation \r\n  agreement.Â  Accordingly, the master found that because Dr. Wang signed the Agreement, \r\n  she was bound by it and thus, she was liable for breach of contract in the amount \r\n  of $18,000 as well as costs.Â  Concomitantly, the master found that because Dr. \r\n  Dong did not sign the Agreement, he was not a party to it, and therefore he \r\n  was not liable.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the trial court err in holding that Dr. Dong was not a party to the Agreement \r\n  dated May 31, 2000?\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the trial court err in holding that the May 31, 2000 Agreement complied \r\n  with statutory requirements and as such, Dr. Wang was bound by its terms?\r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the trial court err in ruling Dr. Wang was liable to Respondent in the amount \r\n  of $18,000 under the May 31, 2000 Agreement?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action to recover a brokerâ€™s commission \r\n  is an action at law.Â  Chambers v. Pingree, 351 S.C. 442, 449, 570 S.E.2d \r\n  528, 531-532 (Ct. App. 2002) (citing United Farm Agency v. Malanuk, 284 \r\n  S.C. 382, 383, 325 S.E.2d 544, 545 (1985)).Â  In an action at law, the appellate \r\n  court will correct any error of law, but it must affirm the masterâ€™s factual \r\n  findings unless there is no evidence that reasonably support those findings.Â  \r\n  Sea Cabins on the Ocean IV Homeowners Assâ€™n, Inc. v. City of N. Myrtle Beach, \r\n  337 S.C. 380, 388, 523 S.E.2d 193, 197 (Ct. App. 1999); Jefferies v. Phillips, \r\n  316 S.C. 523, 527, 451 S.E.2d 21, 22-23 (Ct. App. 1994); see also \r\n  Waterpointe I Prop. Ownerâ€™s Assâ€™n Inc. v. Paragon, Inc., 342 S.C. 454, \r\n  459, 536 S.E.2d 878, 881 (Ct. App. 2000) (finding where an action at law for \r\n  interpretation of a contract referred to the master-in-equity for final judgment \r\n  with direct appeal to the supreme court; the appellate court will correct any \r\n  error of law, but must affirm the masterâ€™s findings unless there is no evidence \r\n  reasonably supporting them). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  [6] \r\nAppellants argue the master erred in finding Dr. \r\n  Dong was not a party to the Agreement.Â  Initially, we note this position is \r\n  completely inconsistent with that taken by Appellants at trial.Â  For instance, \r\n  when asked whether he knew Dr. Wang was going to make an offer on the property, \r\n  Dr. Dong responded that he did, but that he never saw the Agreement prior to \r\n  the offer being made.Â  In fact, Dr. Dong repeatedly asserted that he never signed \r\n  the Agreement and because he did not, he maintained that he did not owe â€œanybodyâ€ \r\n  a commission.\r\nAs Respondent correctly points out, Dr. Dong was \r\n  successful in convincing the master that because he did not sign the Agreement, \r\n  he should not be liable.Â  Now Appellants assert that because the master erred \r\n  by finding Dr. Dong was not a party to the Agreement, this caused the master \r\n  to further err in concluding the Agreement met the relevant statutory requirements.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, because the Agreement did not meet the statutory requirements, \r\n  the trial court erred in finding Dr. Wang liable for the $18,000 commission.Â  \r\n  We disagree with this reasoning in its entirety.\r\nAppellantsâ€™ first assertion is that the master \r\n  erred in finding Dr. Dong was not a party to the Agreement.Â  The master concluded \r\n  that the mere presence of Dr. Dongâ€™s name on the Agreement did not make him \r\n  a party, nor did it otherwise invalidate the Agreement as to Dr. Wang.Â  We agree \r\n  with the master.Â  \r\nAppellants aver that because other documents during \r\n  the course of the partiesâ€™ interaction, including the Acknowledgement of Relationship \r\n  form and two of the offers to purchase property, were signed by both Dr. Dong \r\n  and Dr. Wang, this supports their contention that Dr. Dong was a party to the \r\n  contested Agreement.Â  Coupled with the fact that Dr. Dong did most of the negotiating \r\n  with Respondent, Appellants aver this evidence â€œoverwhelmingly establishes that \r\n  both [Dr. Dong and Dr. Wang] were parties to the agreement.â€Â  \r\nBased on our standard of review, we find that there \r\n  is more than sufficient evidence to support the masterâ€™s ruling that Dr. Dong \r\n  was not a party to the Agreement.Â  Not the least of which is Dr. Dongâ€™s own \r\n  testimony that he never saw the Agreement nor was he aware of it until after \r\n  the events leading up to this action had taken place.Â  \r\nNext, Appellants contend that because Dr. Dong \r\n  was a party and did not sign the Agreement, the Agreement fails to satisfy section \r\n  40-57-135(D)(4)(g) of the South Carolina Code.Â  Section 135(D) provides in pertinent \r\n  part that â€œ[a] listing or buyerâ€™s representation agreement must be in writing \r\n  and must set forth all material terms of the partiesâ€™ agency relationship, including, \r\n  but not limited to . . . (g) the signature of all parties.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  40-57-135(D)(4)(g) (2001).Â  Therefore, they argue because Dr. Dong was a party \r\n  and did not sign the Agreement, the trial court erred in holding the Agreement \r\n  was valid.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAs we have already found the master did not err \r\n  in concluding Dr. Dong was not a party to the Agreement, this argument is without \r\n  merit.Â  Significantly, Appellantsâ€™ final argument is very similar.Â  Appellants \r\n  contend that because Dr. Dong did not sign the Agreement and therefore the Agreement \r\n  is invalid, i.e., Respondent failed to comply with the statutory requirements, \r\n  the master erred in holding Dr. Wang was liable to Respondents.Â  Again, because \r\n  we find Dr. Dong was not a party to the Agreement, this argument is without \r\n  merit.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, based on the above discussion, the \r\n  masterâ€™s rulings are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., ANDERSON and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  For clarity, Dr. John Dong will be referred to throughout this opinion \r\n    as Dr. Dong and Dr. Danher W. Wang will be referred to as Dr. Wang.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  The purchase of this property is the catalyst for the current dispute.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Mr. Hargett testified that he contacted the South Carolina Coastal \r\n    Council and others in an attempt to get the approval Appellants sought for \r\n    installation of a dock.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  We feel it appropriate to mention that Mr. Manosâ€™ actions in closing \r\n    the transaction are not being questioned.Â  As Beachside Real Estate notes \r\n    in its brief, â€œMr. Manos is a well-respected, experienced real estate closing \r\n    attorney.Â  Mr. Manosâ€™ integrity and professional handling of this transaction \r\n    is above reproach.â€ \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6] Â  Because all of Appellantsâ€™ issues are closely related, they will \r\n    be addressed together. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-279","title":"State v.

Norris, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, \r\n  and Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; \r\n  and Solicitor John R. Justice, of Chester, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Ravin L. Johnson (â€œAppellantâ€) \r\n  appeals his conviction for voluntary manslaughter.Â  Appellant argues the trial \r\n  judge erred in failing to grant a directed verdict.Â  He contends the evidence \r\n  offered by the State was insufficient to disprove self-defense as a matter of \r\n  law.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn November 3, 2000, Appellant left his home in \r\n  West Columbia and drove to Chester to pick up his cousins, Ezekiel Darnell and \r\n  Mario Johnson.Â  The purpose of the trip was to bring Mario and Ezekiel back \r\n  to Columbia because Appellant and Mario worked together and both were due at \r\n  work the next day. \r\nUpon arrival in Chester, Appellant went \r\n  to Brian Jacksonâ€™s house.Â  There he met Brian, his brother, two of their friends, \r\n  Mario and Ezekiel.Â  Shortly thereafter, Appellant, Ezekiel, and Brian decided \r\n  to go to a party on Cemetery Street to visit Brandon Johnson, another of Appellantâ€™s \r\n  cousins.Â  Ezekiel and Appellant rode in Marioâ€™s car, Mario drove Appellantâ€™s \r\n  truck, and Brian drove his own car. \r\nAppellant and Ezekiel stayed at the party \r\n  for approximately fifteen minutes before deciding to leave and drive back to \r\n  Columbia.Â  Mario drove off first in Appellantâ€™s truck, followed closely by Appellant \r\n  and Ezekiel in Marioâ€™s car. [1] Â  \r\n  Appellant was driving and Ezekiel was riding in the passenger seat.Â  As Appellant \r\n  and Ezekiel turned onto Cemetery Street, they noticed Danielle Hughes and Jonathan \r\n  Mackey walking across the street.Â Â  Ezekiel erroneously thought he knew Hughes \r\n  and, as a result, said something to her as they were passing by.Â Â  \r\nEzekiel noticed that Mackey responded, \r\n  but he could not make out exactly what had been said because music was playing \r\n  loudly in the car.Â  Ezekiel then asked Appellant to back up.Â  After backing \r\n  up, it became apparent to Appellant and Ezekiel that Mackey was angry with them. \r\n  Â Â Mackey then pulled a .38 caliber handgun from his pocket and began firing \r\n  at the car.Â Â  One of the bullets shattered the back window of the car and lodged \r\n  in the rear seat. \r\nBoth Ezekiel and Appellant ducked when \r\n  the shooting began.Â  Appellant attempted to shake Ezekiel, but did not get a \r\n  response.Â Â  Ezekiel testified that he became hysterical and panicked.Â  Unable \r\n  to get a response from Ezekiel, Appellant reached under his seat and obtained \r\n  the gun he had taken from his own car earlier in the evening.Â Â  Appellant opened \r\n  his door and fired a single shot at Mackey.Â  The bullet penetrated Mackeyâ€™s \r\n  cheek where it lacerated the base of the brain and spinal cord.Â  Mackey died \r\n  in less than a minute.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAppellant then shut his door, pushed Ezekiel \r\n  up, and drove to his uncleâ€™s house where he attempted to contact his father.Â  \r\n  Eventually, Appellant and Ezekiel went back to Columbia.Â  The next morning, \r\n  accompanied by Appellantâ€™s mother, father, and uncle, both Appellant and Ezekiel \r\n  went to the Chester Police Department where they related the previous eveningâ€™s \r\n  events and turned over Appellantâ€™s handgun. \r\nA Chester County grand jury indicted Appellant \r\n  for murder.Â  Appellant did not testify at trial.Â  At the close of the evidence, \r\n  Appellantâ€™s counsel moved for a directed verdict on the murder charge.Â  Counsel \r\n  asserted there was no evidence of â€œmalice aforethoughtâ€ given the evidence established \r\n  that Mackey fired the first shot.Â Â  However, he stated â€œthere might be evidence \r\n  to sustain a conviction on the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter.â€Â  \r\n  Throughout this discussion, defense counsel asserted the theory of self-defense.Â  \r\n  After hearing arguments from counsel, the judge directed a verdict as to the \r\n  murder charge, finding there was no evidence tending to show malice aforethought.Â  \r\n  The judge then informed counsel that he would charge the jury on voluntary manslaughter.\r\nThe jury convicted Appellant of voluntary manslaughter.Â Â  \r\n  After the verdict was read, defense counsel moved for a new trial on the ground \r\n  the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law as to the charge of voluntary \r\n  manslaughter.Â  The judge denied the motion.Â  He then sentenced Appellant to \r\n  fifteen years imprisonment.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAppellant argues the trial judge erred in failing \r\n  to direct a verdict as to the voluntary manslaughter charge, as the evidence \r\n  offered by the State was insufficient as a matter of law to disprove self-defense.\r\nIn criminal cases, â€œ[a] defendant is entitled to \r\n  a directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.â€Â  \r\n  State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 97, 544 S.E.2d 30, 36 (2001).Â  â€œIn reviewing \r\n  a motion for directed verdict, the trial judge is concerned with the existence \r\n  of the evidence, not with its weight.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œIf there is any direct \r\n  evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove \r\n  the guilt of the accused, an appellate court must find that the case was properly \r\n  submitted to the jury.â€ State v. McGowan, 347 S.C. 618, 622, 557 S.E.2d \r\n  657, 659 (2001).Â Â  On appeal from the denial of a motion for directed verdict, \r\n  this Court must view the evidence in a light most favorable to the State.Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\nAt trial, Appellant argued that he shot Mackey \r\n  in self-defense.Â  In order for a defendant to establish self-defense, the following \r\n  four elements must exist: \r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp;the defendant must be without fault in bringing on the difficulty; (2) the \r\n  defendant must have been in actual imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining \r\n  serious bodily injury, or he must have actually believed he was in imminent \r\n  danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury; (3) if his defense \r\n  is based upon his belief of imminent danger, defendant must show that a reasonably \r\n  prudent person of ordinary firmness and courage would have entertained the belief \r\n  that he was actually in imminent danger and that the circumstances were such \r\n  as would warrant a person of ordinary prudence, firmness, and courage to strike \r\n  the fatal blow in order to save himself from serious bodily harm or the loss \r\n  of his life; and (4) the defendant had no other probable means of avoiding the \r\n  danger. \r\n\r\nState v. Day, 341 S.C. 410, 416, 535 S.E.2d 431, 434 \r\n  (2000).Â  \r\nThe defendant has the burden of raising self-defense.Â  \r\n  However, once raised, the State has the burden of disproving it beyond a reasonable \r\n  doubt.Â  State v. Wiggins, 330 S.C. 538, 544, 500 S.E.2d 489, 492 (1998).Â  \r\n  Significantly, in this case, the parties only dispute the existence of the first \r\n  and fourth elements.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nInitially, we note this issue was not properly \r\n  raised at trial.Â  During the discussion regarding Appellantâ€™s motion for a directed \r\n  verdict on the murder charge, counsel agreed there was evidence to support a \r\n  voluntary manslaughter charge.Â  Thus, no motion was ever made to direct a verdict \r\n  as to the voluntary manslaughter charge.Â  Although after the jury verdict had \r\n  been returned, defense counsel made a motion asking the court to â€œstrike the \r\n  verdict and to find as a matter of law the defendant not guilty of voluntary \r\n  manslaughter due to the insufficiency of the evidence,â€ this does not preserve \r\n  the issue presented by Appellant in this appeal.Â Â  In a criminal case, the only \r\n  way to contest the sufficiency of the evidence post-trial is to move for a new \r\n  trial.Â  State v. Follin, 352 S.C. 235, 258, 573 S.E.2d 812, 824 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2002), cert. denied (May 30, 2003).Â  In addition, because Appellant \r\n  did not raise the issue of insufficiency of the evidence as to self-defense \r\n  in the court below, it cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.Â  See \r\n  State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1989) (holding that \r\n  a party cannot raise one ground for directed verdict to the court below and \r\n  another on appeal).Â  Therefore, we find the issue presented by appellant was \r\n  not properly preserved for our review.\r\nIn the alternative, Appellant argues the trial judge erred \r\n  in failing to grant judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV).Â Â  However, \r\n  JNOV motions are civil in nature and are not appropriate in criminal trials.Â  \r\n  See Follin, 352 S.C. at 258, 573 S.E.2d at 824 (â€œA motion for \r\n  JNOV is a civil trial motion, and thus it is improper for a party to move for \r\n  JNOV in a criminal trial . . .

Brown, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nSteven L. Smith, Esquire and Wm. Mark Koontz, both of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Purchasers of a home sued the \r\n  property development company that sold them the home and the construction company \r\n  that built the home for the structural damages resulting from construction.Â  \r\n  The construction company, Crosby Construction Company (â€œCrosby Constructionâ€), \r\n  appeals the jury verdict in favor of the purchasers.Â  We affirm in part, reverse \r\n  in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nCrosby Construction was a charter member \r\n  of the Southern Living Builder Program and agreed to build homes according to \r\n  Southern Living plans and specifications.Â  However, Max Crosby, owner of Crosby \r\n  Construction, testified that Crosby Construction was allowed to alter the Southern \r\n  Living plans.Â  Crosby Construction contracted with Greenwood Development Corporation \r\n  (â€œGreenwoodâ€) to build five model homes in Coosaw Creek Country Club in North \r\n  Charleston, South Carolina.Â Â  One of the five homes built by Crosby Construction \r\n  for Greenwood was the home eventually purchased by Mark and Karen New. \r\nCrosby Construction and Greenwood agreed \r\n  to numerous modifications of the Southern Living plans with regards to the house \r\n  in question.Â  Specifically, the basement was eliminated, a finished media room \r\n  was provided, and the master bedroom and kitchen were made larger.Â  Additionally, \r\n  rather than utilizing steel beams, as the original Southern Living plans specified, \r\n  Crosby Construction changed the design to utilize wooden beams, which Max Crosby \r\n  believed were appropriate.Â  \r\nCrosby Construction completed the home \r\n  for Greenwood in June of 1998.Â  Greenwood used it as a model home, advertised \r\n  the home as a Southern Living home, and sold the home to the News on October \r\n  21, 1998.Â Â  Crosby Construction had no hand in the sale of the house from Greenwood \r\n  to the News, and the Newsâ€™ contract with Greenwood made no mention of Crosby \r\n  Construction.Â Â  Mark New testified that he and Karen understood they were purchasing \r\n  a â€œSouthern Livingâ€ home. \r\nThe News discovered several problems with \r\n  their home.Â  Most significantly, the News at some point discovered a hump and \r\n  sag in their second story floor.Â  Investigation revealed the wood beams Crosby \r\n  Construction had substituted for the specified steel beams proved inadequate \r\n  to support the load placed on them.Â  Crosby Construction sent a subcontractor \r\n  in to fix the beam causing the sag, however, it was inadequate.Â Â  Other problems \r\n  discovered by the News included a leaking roof, inadequate foundation, an incorrectly \r\n  sloped yard that did not drain, a bowed exterior wall, cupped and warped floors, \r\n  a poorly built retention wall, and poor flashing. \r\nThe News brought suit against Greenwood \r\n  and Crosby Construction, alleging the breach of several implied warranties, \r\n  negligence, and unfair trade practices.Â  The News sought actual and punitive \r\n  damages against Crosby Construction and Greenwood.Â  Crosby Construction and \r\n  Greenwood filed answers denying the material allegations and asserting various \r\n  affirmative defenses.Â  The News subsequently dismissed the action against Greenwood \r\n  and chose instead to proceed exclusively against Crosby Construction.\r\n After directing a verdict against the \r\n  News on their claim for unfair trade practices, the trial court denied Crosby \r\n  Constructionâ€™s directed verdict motions and objections to the charges presented \r\n  to the jury.Â  At the conclusion of the four-day trial, the jury returned a verdict \r\n  against Crosby Construction for $285,942 in actual damages.Â  Crosby Construction \r\n  then filed post-trial motions for a JNOV, a new trial absolute, and a new trial \r\n  nisi remittitur.Â Â  These motions were denied.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. STIGMA DAMAGES\r\nCrosby Construction contends the circuit court \r\n  erred in refusing to grant its motion for directed verdict as to the Newsâ€™ claim \r\n  of diminution in property value, or â€œstigmaâ€ damages.Â  Crosby Construction also \r\n  contends the circuit court erred in failing to grant a new trial absolute where \r\n  there was no evidence to support the juryâ€™s award.Â  We agree.\r\nA. Directed Verdict\r\nAt trial, Crosby Construction moved for \r\n  a directed verdict on the Newsâ€™ claim for stigma damages, arguing there was \r\n  no testimony regarding the value of the home after repairs and to award both \r\n  the cost of repairs and stigma damages would amount to double recovery.Â  The \r\n  circuit court disagreed, finding Dr. New had testified to the value of the home \r\n  after all the repairs had been made, amounting to diminution in value.Â  Crosby \r\n  Construction contends the circuit court erred in allowing the question of stigma \r\n  damages to go to the jury.Â  \r\nIn ruling on motions for directed verdict, \r\n  the trial court is required to â€œview the evidence and the inferences that reasonably \r\n  can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the \r\n  motion[] and to deny the motion[] where either the evidence yields more than \r\n  one inference or its inference is in doubt.â€Â  Strange v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Highways \r\n  &amp; Pub. Transp., 314 S.C. 427, 429-30, 445 S.E.2d 439, 440 (1994).Â  We \r\n  will reverse the trial court only when there is no evidence to support the ruling \r\n  below.Â  Id. at 430, 445 S.E.2d at 440.Â  \r\nStigma, or diminution in value, damages are generally \r\n  awarded when there is a permanent injury to real property.Â  See Gray \r\n  v. S. Facilities, Inc., 256 S.C. 558, 569, 183 S.E.2d 438, 443 (1971) (holding \r\n  that â€œ[t]he general rule is that in case of an injury of a permanent nature \r\n  to real property . . . the proper measure of damages is the diminution of the \r\n  market value by reason of that injury, or in other words, the difference between \r\n  the value of the land before the injury and its value after the injuryâ€).Â  Thus, \r\n  where there is a permanent injury to land, damages are based on the diminution \r\n  in value of the property based on its value before the injury and after the \r\n  injury.Â  Yadkin Brick Co. v. Materials Recovery Co., 339 S.C. 640, 645, \r\n  529 S.E.2d 764, 767 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\n\r\nWhile proof, with mathematical certainty, of the amount \r\n  of loss or damage is not required, in order for damages to be recoverable the \r\n  evidence should be such as to enable the court or jury to determine the amount \r\n  thereof with reasonable certainty or accuracy.Â  Neither the existence, causation \r\n  nor amount of damages can be left to conjecture, guess or speculation. \r\n\r\nGray, 256 S.C. at 570-71, 183 S.E.2d at 444.\r\nThe News presented evidence at trial that \r\n  repairs to their home would cost $129,930.42.Â  This figure consisted of estimates \r\n  to repair the foundation, flashing, roof leaks, ridge beam and holes, landscaping \r\n  problems, as well as cosmetic damages.Â  Although the Newsâ€™ experts testified \r\n  that repairing the problems would not give the News the Southern Living home \r\n  they expected, they stated the problems could all be repaired.Â  However, one \r\n  expert opined that an entire new roof would need to be put in place because \r\n  there would always be leaks even if the current roof were repaired.Â  \r\nDr. Mark New testified at trial that he wanted \r\n  the jury to give him enough money to repair the house.Â  He also expressed concern \r\n  that he would have to disclose the structural damage to the house upon resale.Â Â  \r\n  Dr. New estimated the value of the home if it were in good condition to be $550,000.Â Â  \r\n  When asked to estimate the value of the home â€œin its present condition,â€ Dr. \r\n  New stated it would be $300,000 to $350,000.Â Â  Thus, we interpret Dr. Newâ€™s \r\n  testimony to state that the difference in value of the home if it had been built \r\n  in accordance with Southern Living plans and the value of the home in its then \r\n  current, unrepaired state to be between $200,000 and $250,000.Â Â Â  \r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable \r\n  to the News, no evidence was presented as to the diminution in value of the \r\n  home if all the repairs were performed.Â  Although Dr. New testified regarding \r\n  the problems disclosing the prior structural damage would pose in trying to \r\n  sell the house, he did not place a value on the home after repairs were performed.Â  \r\n  His testimony only addressed the value of the home in its unrepaired state and \r\n  the value of the home had it been constructed according to the Southern Living \r\n  plans.Â  As Crosby Construction argued before the circuit court, allowing recovery \r\n  for both the cost of repairs and the diminution in value of the home prior to \r\n  repairs would amount to double recovery.Â  Further, the failure to present evidence \r\n  of the diminution in value of the repaired home left the jury to speculate as \r\n  to the amount of stigma damages.Â  Because there was no testimony regarding the \r\n  amount of stigma damages, the circuit court erred in failing to direct a verdict \r\n  on this theory of recovery. [1] Â  \r\n  Gray, 256 S.C. at 570-71, 183 S.E.2d at 444; see also Collins \r\n  Music Co. v. Smith, 332 S.C. 145, 147, 503 S.E.2d 481, 482 (Ct. App. 1998) \r\n  (noting the general rule that there can be no double recovery for a single injury).Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we reverse the circuit courtâ€™s denial of the motion for a directed \r\n  verdict as to stigma damages.\r\nB. New Trial Absolute\r\nCrosby Construction argues the circuit court erred in failing to \r\n  grant a new trial absolute because there was no evidence to support the juryâ€™s \r\n  award.Â  We agree.\r\nThe decision to grant or deny a motion \r\n  for a new trial absolute is within the trial courtâ€™s discretion and will not \r\n  be reversed unless the courtâ€™s decision is â€œwholly unsupported by the evidence \r\n  or the conclusions reached are controlled by error of law.â€Â  Vinson v. Hartley, \r\n  324 S.C. 389, 405, 477 S.E.2d 715, 723 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  In determining whether \r\n  the trial court erred in denying a motion for a new trial, we must look at the \r\n  testimony and inferences raised therefrom in favor of the nonmoving party.Â  \r\n  Id.; Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 302-03, 536 S.E.2d 408, 420 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\nThe circuit court may grant a new trial absolute \r\n  in two instances.Â  The court must grant a motion for a new trial absolute when \r\n  the verdict is â€œâ€˜so grossly excessive that it shocks the conscience of the court \r\n  and clearly indicates the verdict was the result of caprice, passion, prejudice, \r\n  partiality, corruption, or other improper motive.â€™â€Â  Duncan v. Hampton Co. \r\n  Sch. Dist. No. 2, 335 S.C. 535, 547, 517 S.E.2d 449, 455 (Ct. App. 1999) \r\n  (quoting Knoke v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Parks, Recreation &amp; Tourism, \r\n  324 S.C. 136, 141, 478 S.E.2d 256, 258 (1996)).Â  â€œAlternatively, the trial court \r\n  may grant a new trial absolute when, sitting as the thirteenth juror, \r\n  it concludes the juryâ€™s verdict is not supported by the evidence.â€Â  Duncan, \r\n  335 S.C. at 547, 517 S.E.2d at 455 (emphasis in original).Â  However, substantial \r\n  deference should be given to a juryâ€™s determination of damages.Â  Knoke, \r\n  324 S.C. at 141, 478 S.E.2d at 258.Â  \r\nThe jury rendered a general verdict in \r\n  favor of the News in the amount of $285,942.Â  The evidence presented at trial \r\n  showed that it would cost $129,930.42 to make the repairs to the home.Â  Dr. \r\n  New opined that his home was worth between $200,000 and $250,000 less in its \r\n  unrepaired state than it would be worth had the home been built to Southern \r\n  Living specifications.Â  As discussed above, this estimate does not indicate \r\n  the depreciation to the home after repairs are made and cannot be considered \r\n  in isolation.Â  Giving substantial deference to the juryâ€™s verdict, there is \r\n  not any evidence in the record to support a verdict $155,000 greater than the \r\n  estimate of damages.Â  Because there was no evidence to support the amount of \r\n  the juryâ€™s verdict, the circuit court erred by failing to grant Crosby Constructionâ€™s \r\n  motion for a new trial absolute.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  denial of the motion and remand the case for a new trial absolute.Â  \r\nII. Insurance Testimony\r\nCrosby Construction asserts the circuit court erred \r\n  in admitting into evidence information regarding the insurance related work \r\n  of one of its experts.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nGenerally, the fact that a defendant is protected \r\n  by insurance from liability in an action for damages shall not be made known \r\n  to the jury.Â  Dunn v. Charleston Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 311 S.C. 43, \r\n  45, 426 S.E.2d 756, 757 (1993).Â  The rule protects against unfair prejudice \r\n  in the verdict that might result from the juryâ€™s knowledge that the defendant \r\n  will not have to pay the award amount.Â  Dunn, 311 S.C. at 45, 426 S.E.2d \r\n  at 757-58.Â  However, this general rule does not require evidence of insurance \r\n  to be kept from the jury where it is offered for some other purpose.Â  Rule 411, \r\n  SCRE provides:\r\n\r\nEvidence that a person was or was not insured against liability \r\n  is not admissible upon the issue whether the person acted negligently or otherwise \r\n  wrongfully.Â  This rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of insurance \r\n  against liability when offered for another purpose, such as proof of agency, \r\n  ownership, or control, or bias or prejudice of a witness.\r\n\r\nRule 411, SCRE.&nbsp; \r\nOur Supreme Court has adopted a â€œsubstantial \r\n  connectionâ€ analysis to determine whether an expertâ€™s connection to a defendant \r\n  insurer is sufficiently probative of witness bias to outweigh the prejudice \r\n  to the defendant resulting from the knowledge that the defendant carries liability \r\n  insurance.Â  Yoho v. Thompson, 345 S.C. 361, 366, 548 S.E.2d 584, 586 \r\n  (2001).Â  In Yoho, the defendant in a car wreck case was represented by \r\n  the underinsured motorist carrier, Nationwide Insurance Company.Â  One of the \r\n  defendantâ€™s experts, Dr. Brannon, did a fair amount of consulting work for Nationwide \r\n  and between ten to twenty percent of his practice included consulting for insurance \r\n  companies.Â  Our state Supreme Court reversed the circuit courtâ€™s refusal to \r\n  allow Yoho to question Dr. Brannon regarding his potential bias due to his work \r\n  with insurance companies.Â  The Court determined the connection between Brannon \r\n  and Nationwide was substantial enough to permit Yoho to question him about the \r\n  relationship and potential bias.Â  Yoho, 345 S.C. at 366, 548 S.E.2d at \r\n  586.Â  The Court went on to note that showing the connection to the insurance \r\n  company was qualitatively different from showing the expert worked for the defense \r\n  and was much more indicative of possible bias in favor of the defendant.Â  Id.\r\nIn the present case, Crosby Construction presented \r\n  Robert Lanier as an expert in general contracting.Â Â  Although the Newsâ€™ expert \r\n  testified that most of the repairs to the home could be accomplished for $84,580, \r\n  Lanier testified he could perform the same repairs for $41,901.15.Â Â  Outside \r\n  the presence of the jury, the News stated they wanted to question Lanier regarding \r\n  his estimates for insurance companies which comprised between seventy-five and \r\n  eighty percent of his work.Â Â  Over Crosby Constructionâ€™s objections, the circuit \r\n  court allowed the News to question Lanier about his insurance work.Â  Lanier \r\n  testified to the jury that most of his work came from making repairs for insurance \r\n  companies on claims on homeownerâ€™s insurance policies.Â  He also stated he was \r\n  willing to change his estimates upon the request of insurance companies.Â Â  The \r\n  parties did not know whether Lanier had ever performed work for Zurich, Crosby \r\n  Constructionâ€™s liability insurer, and no testimony was elicited identifying \r\n  specific insurance companies Lanier worked with. \r\nThe present case is distinquishable from \r\n  Yoho.Â  Whereas the expert in Yoho actually performed work for \r\n  the insurance carrier representing the defendant, nothing in this case indicates \r\n  Lanier ever worked for Zurich.Â  Lanier worked with insurance companies under \r\n  homeownerâ€™s policies, not liability policies.Â  Despite the fact that up to eighty \r\n  percent of Lanierâ€™s work came from insurance companies, the â€œsubstantial connectionâ€ \r\n  to the specific carrier that existed in Yoho is simply not present here.Â  \r\n\r\nEven though there is no substantial connection \r\n  in the present case, we believe the admission of evidence regarding Lanierâ€™s \r\n  connection to insurance carriers was permissible.Â  â€œA witness may be cross-examined \r\n  on any matter relevant to any issue in the case, including credibility.â€Â  Rule \r\n  611(b), SCRE.Â  â€œConsiderable latitude is allowed in cross-examination to test \r\n  a witnessâ€™s bias, prejudice, or credibility.â€Â  Yoho, 345 S.C. at 364-65, \r\n  548 S.E.2d at 585.Â  The trial courtâ€™s ruling regarding scope of cross-examination \r\n  to show bias or test credibility will not be overturned on appeal absent an \r\n  abuse of discretion.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nLanier testified that he worked for insurance companies \r\n  on homeownerâ€™s claims.Â  He did not implicate liability insurance in violation \r\n  of Rule 411, SCRE.Â  Further, the testimony elicited at trial did not indicate \r\n  whether Crosby Construction was insured.Â  However, Lanierâ€™s dependence upon \r\n  insurance companies in general for up to eighty percent of his income was evidence \r\n  that impacted Lanierâ€™s credibility or could show potential bias.Â  As the evidence \r\n  did not impermissibly inform the jury regarding Crosby Constructionâ€™s insurance \r\n  status and it was used to test Lanierâ€™s bias, we find no abuse of discretion \r\n  in the present case. [2] Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe circuit court erred in failing to grant Crosby \r\n  Constructionâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on the claim for stigma damages \r\n  where there was no evidence to support the amount of stigma damages and allowing \r\n  the jury to consider stigma damages amounted to double recovery.Â  The circuit \r\n  court also erred in failing to grant Crosby Constructionâ€™s motion for a new \r\n  trial absolute because there was no evidence to support the amount of the juryâ€™s \r\n  award.Â  Finally, we find the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in allowing \r\n  evidence that Crosby Constructionâ€™s expert was connected to insurance companies.Â  Accordingly, the trial court is AFFIRMED \r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED for a new trial absolute.Â  \r\n AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nGOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., and CURETON, AJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  In further support of its claim that the circuit court erred in failing \r\n    to grant a directed verdict, Crosby Construction argues there was no evidence \r\n    to support a claim for stigma damages because the problems with the property \r\n    were not permanent and could be repaired.Â Â  Testimony from the experts indicated \r\n    the problems with the home could be repaired, thus the damages were not necessarily \r\n    â€œpermanentâ€ in nature.Â  However, Crosby Construction did not make this argument \r\n    before the circuit court in support of its motion for directed verdict.Â  Accordingly, \r\n    this argument is not preserved for appellate review.Â  Staubes v. City of \r\n    Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Because we reverse and remand on the issues of the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n    failure to grant Crosby Constructionâ€™s motions for directed verdict and a \r\n    new trial absolute, we need not address Crosby Constructionâ€™s remaining issues \r\n    on appeal.Â  However, we have chosen to address the issue regarding Lanierâ€™s \r\n    connection to insurance companies because it is an issue that is likely to \r\n    repeat itself upon retrial of this case.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-283","title":"Reuben v.

Casey Manning, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-283\r\nSubmitted April 6, 2004 â€“ Filed April 29, 2004 \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nWilliam G. Besley, Esquire, Andrew E. Haselden, Esquire, George \r\n  V. Hanna, IV, of Columbia; for Appellant.\r\nCarey M. Ayer, Esquire, Lisa Lee Smith, of Lexington; for \r\n  Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Lucy J. Reuben and John A. \r\n  Cole (collectively â€œRespondentsâ€) commenced an action against Palmetto Traditional \r\n  Homes, L.L.C. (â€œPalmettoâ€) alleging negligence, loss of consortium, negligent \r\n  misrepresentation and breach of express and implied warranties.Â  Palmetto filed \r\n  a motion to compel arbitration.Â  After a hearing, the trial judge found Respondentsâ€™ \r\n  negligence and loss of consortium claims were not subject to arbitration and \r\n  denied the motion.Â  Palmetto appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\nBACKGROUND\r\nRespondents entered into an agreement \r\n  to purchase a new home from Palmetto for $266,900.Â  Respondents allege that \r\n  prior to the closing, Palmetto took Respondents on a walk-through of the house, \r\n  at which time they were shown an upstairs room over the garage which Palmetto \r\n  represented to be a storage room, suitable for storing personal items.Â  Respondents \r\n  further allege that the door to the storage area had a doorknob on each side, \r\n  indicating the doorway was to be utilized to enter the storage area and that \r\n  the door could be closed by a person standing inside the storage room.Â  Palmetto \r\n  denies that it represented personal items could be stored in the storage room \r\n  or that the room was suitable for walking and/or standing.Â  \r\nThe Respondents purchased the home on February \r\n  18, 2000.Â  On December 3, 2000, Respondent Reuben entered the storage room; \r\n  however, the flooring did not support her weight, and she fell through the floor \r\n  and landed atop a car in the garage below.Â  Respondents allege Reuben sustained \r\n  serious personal injuries as a result of the fall.Â  \r\nRespondents filed a complaint against \r\n  Palmetto alleging various causes of action based on negligence and breach of \r\n  warranty.Â  Palmetto filed an answer and a motion to compel arbitration asserting \r\n  the purchase agreement required any claims arising out of or related to the \r\n  agreement were to be settled by arbitration, and that the contract documents \r\n  between the parties required Respondents to arbitrate this dispute.Â  Respondents \r\n  conceded that their claims for negligent misrepresentation, breach of express \r\n  warranty, and breach of implied warranty of habitability were subject to arbitration \r\n  under the agreement.Â  However, they contended their causes of action for negligence \r\n  and loss of consortium were not subject to arbitration.Â  After a hearing on \r\n  the matter, the trial judge denied Palmettoâ€™s motion to compel arbitration finding \r\n  (1) Respondentsâ€™ personal injury claims did not arise out of the contract and \r\n  were not subject to arbitration and (2) S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-10(b)(4) specifically \r\n  excludes personal injury claims from arbitration and that the Federal Arbitration \r\n  Act (â€œFAAâ€) did not preempt the South Carolina Uniform Arbitration Act (â€œSCUAAâ€).Â  \r\n\r\n STANDARD\r\nOF REVIEW\r\n   Unless otherwise provided by the parties, \r\n    the question of the arbitrability of a claim is an issue for judicial determination.Â  \r\n    Stokes v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 351 S.C. 606, 609, 571 S.E.2d \r\n    711, 713 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  The determination of whether or not a matter is \r\n    arbitrable is subject to de novo review.Â  Id.Â  However, \r\n    a circuit courtâ€™s factual findings on the arbitrability of a claim will not \r\n    be overruled if there is any evidence reasonably supporting them.Â  Id.Â  \r\n    at 609-10, 571 S.E.2d at 713.\r\n   LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n     Palmetto contends the trial court erred in \r\n      denying its motion to compel arbitration.Â  It argues (1) Respondentsâ€™ claims \r\n      for negligence and loss of consortium fall within the scope of the arbitration \r\n      agreement and (2) even though S.C. Code Ann Â§ 15-48-10(b)(4) of the SCUAA \r\n      excludes personal injury claims, the FAA preempts the SCUAA with respect \r\n      to Respondents claims.Â  Because we find Respondentsâ€™ claims for negligence \r\n      and loss of consortium do not fall within the scope of the partiesâ€™ arbitration \r\n      agreement, we find the trial court properly denied the motion to compel.Â  \r\n      Accordingly, we need not reach the issue of preemption.Â  \r\n    â€œAn arbitration clause is a contractual \r\n      term, and general rules of contract interpretation must be applied to determine \r\n      a clauseâ€™s applicability to a particular dispute.â€Â  Towles v. United \r\n      HealthCare Corp., 338 S.C. 29, 41, 524 S.E.2d 839, 846 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\n      Arbitration rests on the agreement of the parties, and the range of issues \r\n      that can be arbitrated is restricted by the terms of the agreement; a party \r\n      cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not \r\n      agreed to submit.Â  Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, \r\n      596-97, 553 S.E.2d 110, 118 (2001).Â Â Â Â  \r\n    The arbitration agreement in the instant case provides \r\n      in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n    Any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating \r\n      to this Agreement or your purchase of the Home including claims under the \r\n      Limited Warranty shall be settled by arbitration pursuant to the Uniform \r\n      Arbitration Act, Section 15-48-10 et seq., Code of Laws of South \r\n      Carolina (1976) as amended, in accordance with the Construction Industry \r\n      Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (â€œAAAâ€), and judgment \r\n      rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be confirmed, entered and enforced in \r\n      any court having jurisdiction.Â  \r\n\r\n    The plain meaning of this clause \r\n      is that arbitration was intended by the parties to resolve all disputes \r\n      arising out of or relating to the purchase of the home.Â  The clause is expressly \r\n      limited to â€œ[a]ny controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating \r\n      to this Agreement or your purchase of the Home including claims \r\n      under the Limited Warranty.â€ (emphasis added) Thus, the arbitration \r\n      clause would clearly apply to contract-based causes of action â€“ those claims \r\n      relating to the agreement, the purchase of the home, or the limited warranty.Â  \r\n      However, Respondentsâ€™ claims for negligence and loss of consortium are tort-based \r\n      claims, unrelated to any of these three subjects.Â  \r\n    In order to decide whether an arbitration agreement \r\n      encompasses a dispute, the court must determine whether the factual allegations \r\n      underlying the claim fall within the scope of the arbitration clause, regardless \r\n      of the label assigned to the claim.Â  Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 597, 553 \r\n      S.E.2d at 118.Â  One method to determine whether a tort cause of action falls \r\n      within the scope of an agreement to arbitrate is to determine whether â€œthe \r\n      particular tort claim is so interwoven with the contract that it could not \r\n      stand alone.â€Â  Id., at 597 n.4, 553 S.E.2d at 119 n.4.Â  â€œ[I]f the \r\n      tort claim is completely independent of the contract and could be maintained \r\n      without reference to the contract, the tort claim is not arbitrable.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n    \r\n    In the instant case, Respondentsâ€™ alleged personal \r\n      injuries stem from the fact that a storage room was improperly constructed \r\n      such that it could not support Reubenâ€™s weight.Â  As public policy imposes \r\n      a legal duty upon builders to construct safe housing, Respondents need not \r\n      sue Palmetto under the contract to recover for such tort-based injuries.Â  \r\n      See Kennedy v. Columbia Lumber &amp; Mfg. Co., 299 S.C. 335, \r\n      346, 384 S.E.2d 730, 737 (1989) (â€œpublic policy . . . demands the imposition \r\n      of a legal duty on a builder to refrain from constructing housing that he \r\n      knows or should know will pose serious risks of physical harm. . .â€ and \r\n      â€œsuch a duty . . . should extend to foreseeable parties. . . .â€).Â  In the \r\n      case at hand, the alleged serious risk of physical harm was not personal \r\n      to Respondents as those who purchased the home and entered the arbitration \r\n      agreement.Â  We find compelling Palmettoâ€™s argument that the person falling \r\n      through the floor could have been a household member or guest in the home \r\n      who would not be bound by the arbitration agreement, yet could maintain \r\n      a tort action against Palmetto.Â  The fact that Reuben is a party to the \r\n      agreement and is the person who allegedly fell through the floor is inconsequential.Â  \r\n      The personal injuries alleged by Respondents, based on Palmettoâ€™s negligent \r\n      acts, are not so interwoven with the contract that they could not stand \r\n      alone.\r\n       AFFIRMED.\r\n      HUFF, STILWELL, and CURETON, \r\n        A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-284","title":"Trost v.

Golding, of Myrtle Beach, for Appellant.\r\nRandall J. Trost, of Lynchburg, Virginia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Sea Mark Tower Property Owners \r\n  Association, Inc. (â€œAssociationâ€) appeals the Master-in-Equityâ€™s decision ordering \r\n  it to reinstall the awnings over the balconies of the penthouse units in the \r\n  Sea Mark Tower Horizontal Property Regime (â€œRegimeâ€). We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Regime was established in \r\n  December of 1994 and Sea Mark Tower was built in 1985.Â  At the time of building \r\n  construction, awnings were installed over the balconies of the two penthouse \r\n  units.Â  \r\nThere have been numerous problems with water intrusion \r\n  into the building for years.Â  InÂ  1998, the Association hired Law Engineering \r\n  and Environmental Securities, Inc. to assess the buildingâ€™s structural integrity \r\n  and identify the reasons for water leakage problems with the building.Â  Although \r\n  the Law Engineering reports revealed water leakage problems from roofs, windows, \r\n  and the stucco, they did not state that the penthouse awnings were sources of \r\n  any water leakage.Â  \r\nUpon receiving the Law Engineering reports, the \r\n  Association hired Glasstec, a waterproofing company, to correct the water leakage \r\n  problems.Â  In order to waterproof the walls and floors of the penthouse balconies, \r\n  Glasstec removed the awnings and awning structures.Â  Glasstec refused to provide \r\n  a warranty on its work if the awning structures were replaced through its waterproofing.Â  \r\n  Randall Trost, the owner of penthouse unit 1201 demanded the awning be replaced.Â  \r\n  The Board offered to restore the awnings, but only if Trost took responsibility \r\n  for any subsequent leakage.Â  Trost refused.Â  The awnings have not been restored \r\n  to their original position.\r\nTrost filed this action against the Association \r\n  seeking an injunction requiring the Association to replace the awning structures \r\n  on the balconies and refrain from interfering with the awnings in the future.Â  \r\n  The master determined the penthouse awnings were limited common elements and \r\n  their removal by the Association was an ultra vires act.Â  The \r\n  master ordered the Association to pay for all expenses and damages from the \r\n  awningsâ€™ removal and to pay for their reinstallation.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nActions for injunctive relief are equitable \r\n  in nature.Â  Godfrey v. Heller, 311 S.C. 516, 517, 429 S.E.2d 859, 860 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1993).Â  On appeal, in an action in equity, tried by a master alone, \r\n  this court may find facts in accordance with its views of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.Â  Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 237, \r\n  391 S.E.2d 538, 543 (1989); Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, \r\n  266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  This broad scope of review, however, \r\n  does not require this court to disregard the findings of the master, who saw \r\n  and heard the witnesses and was in a better position to evaluate their credibility.Â  \r\n  Tiger, 301 S.C. at 237, 391 S.E.2d at 543.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limited Common Elements Designation\r\nAppellant argues the master erred in finding the \r\n  penthouse awnings are limited common elements.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe master deed of a horizontal property regime \r\n  should be strictly enforced.Â  Kneale v. Bonds, 317 S.C. 262, 267, 452 \r\n  S.E.2d 840, 842 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  Under the Regimeâ€™s master deed, the Regime \r\n  consists of units, general common elements, and limited common elements.Â  The \r\n  master deed defines each unit as â€œthe interior cubic space, fixtures, appliances, \r\n  furnishings, walls, floors, ceilings, and building material enclosed withinâ€ \r\n  the unfinished surface of the structural slab of the ceiling and floor and the \r\n  unfinished interior surface of the perimeter walls, except for load bearing \r\n  walls, which are common elements.Â  The unit also includes â€œall appurtenances \r\n  which are integral and exclusive to the Unit, including but not limited to lamps \r\n  attached to the exterior of the Unit . . .â€Â  \r\nThe master deed does not include such a detailed \r\n  description of what constitutes a limited common element.Â  According to the \r\n  Horizontal Property Act, limited common elements are â€œthose common elements \r\n  which are agreed upon by all the co-owners to be reserved for the use of a certain \r\n  number of apartments to the exclusion of the other apartments . . .â€Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 27-31-20(g) (1991).Â  Although the master deed does not include a definition \r\n  of limited common elements, Exhibit B of the master deed provides that â€œthe \r\n  balcony or balconies adjacent to each unit, including the railing adjacent to \r\n  the same, is a limited common area and is subject to the restrictions and requirements \r\n  as are set out elsewhere in this master deed.â€Â  \r\nWe find a strict construction of the master deed \r\n  supports the masterâ€™s ruling the awnings are limited common elements. There \r\n  is no language in the deed to support the Associationâ€™s contention that the \r\n  awning is part of the unit. The deed confines the unit to the area within the \r\n  four walls, ceiling and floor, with the exception of the specifically mentioned \r\n  exterior lamp.Â  In contrast, the deed does provide support for Trostâ€™s assertion \r\n  that the awnings are limited common elements by providing the balconies are \r\n  limited common elements.Â  It can hardly be said that the balconies are limited \r\n  common elements, yet the awnings that hang over them are not.Â  \r\nIn addition, the testimony presented during trial \r\n  supports the masterâ€™s conclusion that the awnings are limited common elements.Â  \r\n  Sandy Kelly, the president of the Association testified that in 1999 the Associationâ€™s \r\n  Board of Directors had concluded the awnings were common elements of the Regime.Â  \r\n  Three witnesses involved in the development, design, and construction of Sea \r\n  Mark Tower also confirmed the awnings were limited common elements.Â  Kit Christopher, \r\n  Sea Mark Towerâ€™s developer and original owner of unit 1201 testified the awnings \r\n  were intended to be an â€œarchitectural featureâ€ of the building.Â  George Howell, \r\n  designer of Sea Mark Tower, testified the awnings were included as part of the \r\n  original design on construction drawings for the building, and were intended \r\n  to enhance the overall appearance and attractiveness of the building.Â  Tom Roe, \r\n  also an original developer of Sea Mark Tower, Roe testified it was the intent \r\n  of developers that the awnings be common elements or limited common elements \r\n  when they were installed.Â  He declared, â€œI signed the Master Deed.Â  I was on \r\n  the original Board.Â  Iâ€™ve served as Treasurer and President.Â  And there was \r\n  never any question in my mind . . . about the nature of those awnings.â€Â  \r\nBased on the above, we find the master properly \r\n  concluded the penthouse awnings were limited common elements.Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Removal of the Penthouse AwningsÂ  \r\nThe Association argues that because the master \r\n  designated the penthouse awnings to be limited common elements, he erred in \r\n  finding the removal of the penthouse awnings was beyond the Associationâ€™s authority.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe board of directors of a horizontal \r\n  property regime may exercise only those powers that are granted to it by law, \r\n  its master deed, and by any bylaws made pursuant thereto.Â  See S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ Â§ 27-31-100 and 37-31-150 (1991); Seabrook Island Prop. Owners Assâ€™n \r\n  v. Pelzer, 292 S.C. 343, 347, 356 S.E.2d 411, 414 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Any \r\n  act beyond the scope of the powers so granted is ultra vires.Â  Seabrook, \r\n  292 S.C. at 347, 356 S.E.2d at 414.Â  In addition, the allocation of a limited \r\n  common element may not be altered without the consent of the unit owners whose \r\n  units are affected. 15A Am. Jur. 2nd Condominiums Â§ 30 (2000).\r\nSection XVIII of the master deed states:\r\n\r\nThe Association shall have the right to make or cause to \r\n  be made such alterations, modifications and improvements to the common elements, \r\n  provided such alterations, modifications or improvements are first approved \r\n  in writing by the Board of Directors of the Association; provided further that \r\n  such alterations, modifications or improvements do not adversely affect the \r\n  value of the Common Elements or Units in the Regime and the cost of such alterations, \r\n  modifications or improvements shall be assessed as common expenses . . . .  [1] \r\n\r\n Clearly, the master deed does not grant \r\n  the Association express power to remove the awnings.Â  As the awnings are limited \r\n  common elements the Association only has authority under section XVIII of the \r\n  master deed to alter, modify, or improve them.Â  The master \r\n  deed does not grant the Association the power to permanently remove a \r\n  limited common element.Â  In fact, Article XX of the master deed mandates that \r\n  the Association shall be responsible for the maintenance, repair, and replacement \r\n  of all the common elements.Â  \r\nFurthermore, Article XVIII of the master deed \r\n  only allows alterations, modifications, and improvements to common elements \r\n  that do not adversely affect the value of the common elements or units.Â  Removing \r\n  the awnings rendered them completely worthless.Â  In addition, other common elements \r\n  and units were adversely affected.Â  For example, removal of the awnings affected \r\n  the architectural appearance of the building and the ability of the penthouse \r\n  unitsâ€™ air conditioning systems to adequately cool the units.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the permanent removal of the awnings was in contravention of Article XVIII. \r\n\r\n The Association asserts it was fulfilling \r\n  its obligation under the master deed to repair the regime property by deciding \r\n  to not replace the awnings, which it claims were a source of water intrusion.Â  \r\n\r\nThere is no evidence in the record demonstrating \r\n  the penthouse awnings were a source of water leakage.Â  The Law Engineering reports \r\n  did not indicate the penthouse awnings contributed to the water leakage.Â  A \r\n  previous Board member, Thomas Roe, testified that he and others attempted to \r\n  locate water leaks by hosing down the balcony of unit 1201.Â  However, they were \r\n  unsuccessful in tracing any leakage to the awnings.Â  In addition, although Ron \r\n  Weaver of Glasstec testified the awning framework would jeopardize the integrity \r\n  of the waterproofing, he acknowledged that proper sealing would have been sufficient \r\n  to prevent any leakage.Â  Thus, simple repair and maintenance, which is required \r\n  under the master deed, was sufficient.Â  As the master deed must be strictly \r\n  enforced, we find the Association only had the power to repair and maintain, \r\n  not permanently remove, the penthouse awnings.Â  Accordingly, the Association \r\n  was acting beyond the scope of its authority in deciding against reinstalling \r\n  the awnings after work was completed on the balconies.\r\nÂ III.Â Â  Business Judgment\r\nRule&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nThe Association argues its decision to remove \r\n  the penthouse awnings is protected by the business judgment rule.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\nThe business judgment rule only applies to intra \r\n  vires acts, and not to ultra vires acts.Â  Seabrook Island Prop. Owners \r\n  Assâ€™n v. Pelzer, 292 S.C. 343, 348, 356 S.E.2d 411, 414 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  \r\n  The Association was only permitted to act in accordance with the law or the \r\n  master deed; any act outside the scope of its power was an ultra vires \r\n  act. See Kuznick v. Bees Ferry Assocs., 342 S.C. 579, 605, 538 \r\n  S.E.2d 15, 28 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nAs we held above, the master deed did not grant \r\n  the Association the power to permanently remove the awnings.Â  As the removal \r\n  of the awnings was an ultra vires act, the Association is not \r\n  protected by the business judgment rule.Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION&nbsp; \r\nBased on the above, we find the penthouse awnings \r\n  are limited common elements.Â  We further find Appellant was without power to \r\n  permanently remove the awnings and its decision to remove them was not protected \r\n  by the business judgment rule.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the lower court \r\n  is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, STILWELL, and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  The master deed provides, â€œThe General Common \r\n    Elements and the Limited Common Elements are hereinafter occasionally collectively \r\n    referred to as â€œthe Common Elements.â€ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-285","title":"Allsbrook v.

Clarke, of North Myrtle Beach, for Appellants.\r\nMark Andrew Brunty and Thomas C. Brittain, both of Myrtle \r\n  Beach, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Appellants Joseph R. Allsbrook, \r\n  Jr., and Russell Allsbrook (Allsbrooks) brought this action against Horry County \r\n  to set aside a tax sale of real property located in Garden City, South Carolina.Â  \r\n  The Allsbrooks also asserted claims against Billy V. Roberts and Roy C. Roberts \r\n  for equitable avoidance and breach of fiduciary duty related to the tax sale.Â  \r\n  The circuit court granted the respondentsâ€™ motion for summary judgment, finding \r\n  the Allsbrooksâ€™ claims were barred by the applicable two-year statute of limitations.Â  \r\n  This appeal followed.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nCarolyn A. Roberts died in July 1991, leaving a \r\n  holographic will disposing of her personal and real property, including her \r\n  half-interests in two Garden City lots.Â  These lots are at the center of the \r\n  dispute in this case.Â  The will devised Mrs. Robertsâ€™ 50% interest in one of \r\n  the lots to her brother, Joseph Allsbrook, Jr., and her 50% interest in the \r\n  other lot to her nephew, Russell Allsbrook.Â  Mrs. Robertsâ€™ surviving husband, \r\n  Billy V. Roberts, was appointed personal representative of the estate.Â  \r\nAs this appeal turns on the application of the \r\n  statute of limitations, the following timeline is critical:Â  In April 1993, \r\n  nearly two years after Mrs. Robertsâ€™ death, Horry County issued an official \r\n  Notice of Levy on the Garden City lots for failure to pay property taxes.Â  Because \r\n  no one claiming an interest in the lots paid the taxes, a delinquent tax sale \r\n  was held on October 4, 1993.Â  Respondent Roy C. Roberts was the successful bidder.Â  \r\n  In December 1994, Roy Roberts filed the tax deed to the lots in his name.Â  \r\nThe probate hearing for Carolyn Robertsâ€™ \r\n  estate was held on June 8, 1995.Â  At the hearing, Joseph Allsbrook challenged \r\n  Billy Robertsâ€™ distribution of several items of Mrs. Robertsâ€™ personal and real \r\n  property.Â  Joseph also argued before the probate judge that Billy Roberts allowed \r\n  the property in question to be sold for delinquent taxes without notifying the \r\n  beneficiaries.Â  Billyâ€™s attorney noted the probate matter was one to determine \r\n  the assets of the estate, and if Joseph sought some additional remedy he would \r\n  need to bring a separate action against Billy.Â  Josephâ€™s attorney agreed that \r\n  the lots were assets of the estate, and the probate judge then stated, â€œSo everyone \r\n  understands it is clearly an asset of the estate, and there is nothing for me \r\n  to determine under this [provision].â€Â  In its order, the probate court found \r\n  with respect to the provision on the property in question, â€œthe matter is agreed \r\n  between the parties and the property contained in paragraph 9 is an asset of \r\n  the estate.â€Â  Joseph appealed the probate courtâ€™s distribution to the circuit \r\n  court, and later to the Court of Appeals.Â  This courtâ€™s final opinion was filed \r\n  November 8, 2000.Â  Allsbrook v. Estate of Roberts, Op. No. 2000-UP-509 \r\n  (S.C. Ct. App. Filed Nov. 8, 2000).In regard to the Garden City lots, this court \r\n  held as follows:\r\n\r\nAllsbrook asserts the probate court erred in holding the lots \r\n  in Garden City, devised in paragraph nine of the will, were assets of the estate.Â  \r\n  At the hearing, the parties agreed the lots were estate assets. . . . Allsbrook \r\n  is not aggrieved by this ruling.Â  See Rule 201(b), SCACR (â€œOnly a party \r\n  aggrieved by an order, judgment or sentence may appeal.â€).Â  Therefore we affirm \r\n  the probate courtâ€™s disposition of this issue.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nOn February 6, 2001, the Allsbrooks filed \r\n  the present action seeking to set aside the 1993 tax sale of the Garden City \r\n  lots.Â  The Allsbrooks alleged Horry County failed to conform to the strict and \r\n  specific requirements of the statutes governing notice and sale of property \r\n  to satisfy delinquent taxes.Â  They further alleged causes of action against \r\n  Billy Roberts, as personal representative, for breach of fiduciary duty and \r\n  equitable avoidance stemming from his failure to pay the delinquent taxes on \r\n  the lots or properly notify the Allsbrooks of the impending tax sale.Â  On Respondentsâ€™ \r\n  motions for summary judgment, the circuit court dismissed the Allsbrooksâ€™ claims, \r\n  finding they were barred by the two-year statute of limitations prescribed by \r\n  South Carolina Code Â§ 12-51-160.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment \r\n  motion, the appellate court applies the same standard which governs the trial \r\n  court:Â  Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any \r\n  material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  \r\n  Laurens Emergency Med. Specialists v. M.S. Bailey &amp; Sons Bankers, \r\n  355 S.C. 104, 108-09, 584 S.E.2d 375, 377 (2003); see also McDonnell \r\n  v. Consol. Sch. Dist. of Aiken, 315 S.C. 487, 489, 445 S.E.2d 638, 639 (1994) \r\n  (holding a motion for summary judgment can be used to raise the defense of statute \r\n  of limitations).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Allsbrooksâ€™ Claim Against Horry County\r\nThe Allsbrooks first argue the circuit \r\n  court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Horry County on their claim \r\n  seeking to set aside the tax sale.Â  We find the circuit court properly ruled \r\n  this cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§Â§ 12-51-40 and \r\n  12-51-50 (Supp. 2003) authorize counties to sell the property of taxpayers delinquent \r\n  in paying their property taxes.Â  In granting this authority, the Code prescribes \r\n  the requirements for notice and conduct of the saleâ€”requirements that are strictly \r\n  enforced.Â  See Â§ 12-51-40 (a)-(f) (notice requirements); Â§ 12-51-50 (conduct \r\n  of sale requirements); see also Rives v. Bulsa, 325 S.C. \r\n  287, 292-93, 478 S.E.2d 878, 881 (Ct. App. 1996) (holding all requirements of \r\n  law leading up to tax sales which are intended for the protection of the taxpayer \r\n  against surprise or the sacrifice of his property are to be regarded as mandatory \r\n  and are to be strictly enforced).Â  If a taxpayer or other interested party desires \r\n  to challenge the propriety of a county tax sale, suit must be filed within the \r\n  limitations period prescribed by Â§ 12-51-160 which provides in part:Â  â€œNo action \r\n  for the recovery of land sold under the provisions of this chapter or for the \r\n  recovery of the possession may be maintained unless brought within two years \r\n  from the date of sale.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-160 (2000).\r\nIn the present case, the Allsbrooks do \r\n  not dispute the fact they brought their action to set aside the tax sale over \r\n  seven years after the date of sale.Â  Rather, they contend the two-year limitations \r\n  period of Â§ 12-51-160 was tolled during the pendency of their appeal from the \r\n  probate courtâ€™s order on the distribution of the estate.Â  We disagree.\r\nThough our stateâ€™s courts have not had \r\n  occasion to consider the narrow question presented, it is well settled in our \r\n  nationâ€™s jurisprudence that the pendency of other legal proceedings may toll \r\n  the statute of limitations on a cause of action where such proceedings prevent \r\n  enforcement of the remedy by action.Â  See 54 C.J.S. Limitations of \r\n  Actions Â§ 121 (1987) (noting that â€œ[w]here a person is prevented from exercising \r\n  his legal remedy by the pendency of legal proceedings, the time during which \r\n  he is thus prevented should not be counted against him in determining whether \r\n  limitations have barred his rightâ€); 51 Am. Jur. 2d Limitations of Actions \r\n  Â§ 207 (2000) (noting that â€œ[d]uring the period of the restraint incident to \r\n  other legal proceedings that are of such a character that the law forbids one \r\n  of the parties to exercise a legal remedy against another, the running of the \r\n  statute of limitations is postponed, or, if it has commenced to run, is suspendedâ€).\r\nIn the main, the courts have found that \r\n  limitations periods are tolled by other pending actions where the pursuit of \r\n  additional or alternative legal remedies is expressly prohibited by statute.Â  \r\n  Typically, this situation arises under statutory schemes that require the exhaustion \r\n  of all administrative remedies before common-law claims seeking redress for \r\n  the injury are permitted.Â  See, e.g., Trent v. Bolger, \r\n  837 F.2d 657, 659-60 (4th Cir. 1988) (holding that when an employee is required \r\n  to exhaust administrative remedies, applicable limitations period for filing \r\n  action is tolled pending exhaustion of the administrative channels); Butler \r\n  v. Glen Oakâ€™s Turf, Inc., 196 Ga. App. 98, 101, 395 S.E.2d 277, 280 (1990) \r\n  (holding that the statute of limitations was tolled on an employeeâ€™s common-law \r\n  tort claim because she was legally barred from pursuing that claim during the \r\n  pendency of her workersâ€™ compensation case).Â  \r\nIn the present case, the ongoing probate \r\n  action involving the disposition of Mrs. Robertsâ€™ estate posed no obstacle to \r\n  the Allsbrooksâ€™ ability to pursue their remedy under the statute governing county \r\n  tax sales.Â  As devisees under the will, their interests in the Garden City lots \r\n  vested immediately upon her death. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-101 (Supp. 2003); see \r\n  also In re Will of Hall, 318 S.C. 188, 192, 456 S.E.2d 439, 441 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1995) (holding that devisee of life estate under will received her \r\n  interest in the property the day the testatrix died).Â  The fact of pending collateral \r\n  litigation with respect to the distribution of property under the will did not \r\n  affect the deviseesâ€™ right to pursue their remedies under the tax sale provisions \r\n  of the Code.Â  Thus, the two-year limitations period was not tolled during the \r\n  pendency of the probate action.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  finding that the Allsbrooksâ€™ action to set aside the tax sale was barred by \r\n  the statute of limitations.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Allsbrooksâ€™ Claims Against Billy Roberts \r\n  and Roy Roberts\r\nThe Allsbrooks also appeal the circuit \r\n  courtâ€™s dismissal of their causes of action against Billy Roberts and Roy Roberts \r\n  for â€œequitable avoidanceâ€ [1]  and breach of fiduciary duty.Â  Under these \r\n  claims, the Allsbrooks essentially alleged Billy Roberts breached his duty of \r\n  care as personal representative of the estate by failing to ensure the taxes \r\n  on the Garden City lots were timely paid, failing to notify the Allsbrooks of \r\n  the tax arrears and impending tax sale, and failing to inform the Allsbrooks \r\n  of their right to redeem the property.Â  These causes of action were dismissed \r\n  by the circuit court as barred by the statute of limitations under S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 12-51-160.\r\nThe Allsbrooks argue it was error for \r\n  the circuit court to apply the limitations period prescribed under the statutory \r\n  provisions governing tax sales to their claims for breach of fiduciary duty \r\n  against Billy Roberts.Â  Under the undisputed facts of the present case, however, \r\n  we consider this question to be purely academic as it would have no impact on \r\n  the result reached by the lower court.Â  \r\nEven if the court applied the maximum three-year \r\n  statute of limitations generally applied to breach of fiduciary duty claims, \r\n  the Allsbrooksâ€™ claims would still be barred.Â  A cause of action for breach \r\n  of fiduciary duty is governed by the discovery rule and must be brought within \r\n  three years of the time the person knew or should have known by exercise of \r\n  reasonable diligence that he had a cause of action.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§Â§ 15-3-530(5) and 15-3-535 (Supp. 2003); Rumpf v. Massachusetts Mut. Life \r\n  Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 386, 394, 593 S.E.2d 183, 187 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nIn this case, the Allsbrooks knew by June 1995 \r\n  that Billy Roberts allowed the property in question to be sold for delinquent \r\n  taxes and that Roy Roberts had purchased the property at the tax sale.Â  Indeed, \r\n  counsel for Joseph clearly admitted at the June 8, 1995, probate hearing that \r\n  the Allsbrooks were fully aware of the tax sale and its implications, stating: \r\n\r\n\r\n[W]e will submit to the Court \r\n  documents that one of the parcels of land that is in the Will, was allowed to \r\n  be sold for taxes through the Horry County Delinquent Tax Collectors office \r\n  . . . As fiduciary, [Billy Roberts] has the responsibility to protect those \r\n  assets of the estate during the administration. . . .Â  I think it is admitted \r\n  that the property was sold through the delinquent tax office, and was purchased \r\n  by Roy Roberts . . .Â  [Billy] Roberts as fiduciary personal representative, \r\n  never notified any of the beneficiaries of the delinquent tax notice or anything, \r\n  and they did not have the opportunity to purchase that property at the tax sale \r\n  or her interest in it, at the tax sale. \r\n\r\nTherefore, actual knowledge of the tax sale can \r\n  be imputed to the Allsbrooks no later than the date of the probate hearing, \r\n  nearly six years before they brought the present action in February 2001.Â  The \r\n  three-year maximum limitations period of Â§ 15-3-530 was unquestionably exceeded.\r\nWe conclude, therefore, that if the circuit \r\n  court erred by lumping together all of the Allsbrooksâ€™ claims under the umbrella \r\n  of Â§ 12-51-160â€™s limitations period, the error is a harmless one.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor these reasons, we find no error with \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s finding that all claims of the Allsbrooks were barred by the \r\n  applicable statute of limitations.Â  The order granting summary judgment in favor \r\n  of Respondents is therefore\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, STILWELL, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Our research reveals no cases in South Carolina that recognize a cause \r\n    of action for â€œequitable avoidance.â€Â  The allegations under this claim in \r\n    the Allsbrooksâ€™ complaint mirror those listed under the breach of fiduciary \r\n    duty cause of action in all material respects.Â  \r\n  Â \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
