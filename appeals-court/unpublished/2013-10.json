Buckner, Circuit Court Judge \n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Unpublished Opinion No. 2013-UP-360 \n\r\n                 Heard April 10, 2013 – Filed October 2, 2013 \n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                AFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n           Appellate Defender LaNelle Cantey DuRant, of\r\n           Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\r\n            Attorney General Alan McCrory Wilson and Assistant\r\n           Attorney General Julie Kate Keeney, both of Columbia,\r\n           for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: A grand jury indicted Appellant David Jakes for three counts of\r\nattempted murder, three counts of attempted armed robbery, and one count of\r\n\npossession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.1 During the\r\nsubsequent trial's voir dire, the trial judge asked, inter alia, whether any potential\r\njuror: (1) was a member of a law enforcement agency; (2) was related to, or had a\r\nclose relationship with, any of the named witnesses; or (3) was biased, prejudiced,\r\nor otherwise unable to give either party a fair trial. Based upon the responses, the\r\ntrial judge excused a few panel members and, thereafter, Jakes utilized three of his\r\nfive allocated strikes. Among the seated jurors was Juror 102 (Juror).\r\n\r\nAfter three witnesses testified, the trial judge informed counsel, in camera, about a\r\nnote he received from Juror expressing concern about her qualification, in light of\r\nher husband's employment as a reserve deputy. The trial judge called in Juror;\r\nJuror confirmed her husband was a reserve deputy and that she had not discussed\r\nthe case with him. The trial judge then asked Juror if her husband's employment\r\naffected her ability to give either party a fair and impartial trial. Juror responded,\r\n\"No, it wouldn't,\" and was allowed to return to the jury room.\r\n\r\nDefense counsel then objected to Juror's continued service, noting the juror\r\ninformation sheet, which the Clerk's Office prepared, listed the occupation of\r\nJuror's spouse as only \"Environmental Health Management.\" Defense counsel\r\nfurther contended that he would have utilized Jakes' strikes differently had he\r\nknown Juror's husband was a reserve deputy. Shortly thereafter, the trial judge\r\nverified that Juror did fully disclose her husband's employment on the juror\r\nquestionnaire as including both \"Environmental Health Management\" and \"reserve\r\ndeputy,\" but \"the Clerk's Office didn't transmit everything\" that Juror filled out on\r\nher juror questionnaire when the Clerk's Office provided counsel with the juror\r\ninformation sheet. The trial judge then declined to excuse Juror due to this\r\n\"Scri[ve]ner's error,\" noting that defense counsel did not request any voir dire\r\nquestion about spousal employment and that a compilation of information from the\r\njuror questionnaires was available, upon request, from the Clerk's Office.\r\n\r\nThe jury subsequently convicted Jakes on three counts of assault and battery in the\r\nfirst degree (a lesser-included offense), three counts of attempted armed robbery,\r\nand one count of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.\r\nJakes was sentenced to thirty-five years' incarceration. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n1The State tried Jakes and Antwan McMillan together. McMillan was indicted for\r\nthree counts of attempted murder, three counts of attempted armed robbery, and\r\none count of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.\r\n\n                                  LAW/ANALYSIS \n\r\n\r\nJakes alleges the trial judge erred in refusing to excuse Juror and replace her with\r\nan alternate because, had Jakes known Juror's husband was a reserve deputy, Jakes\r\nwould have exercised his peremptory challenges differently. Thus, Jakes\r\nessentially argues that because he would have been permitted to exercise a\r\nperemptory strike against Juror, even if she was impartial, based solely upon the\r\noccupation of Juror's husband, the omission of such alleged material information\r\nconstituted prejudice that required replacing Juror with an alternate when the\r\ninformation later came to light.\r\n\r\nNotably, Jakes cites no authority for the specific proposition that a trial court\r\nabuses its discretion in not removing a juror when a defendant contends he would\r\nhave exercised his peremptory challenges differently had he known \"material,\" but\r\npreviously omitted, facts about any particular juror, regardless of that juror's\r\nprofessed impartiality. Because Jakes cites no authoritative support for his specific\r\ncontention, we proceed to determine solely whether Juror was impartial. See State\r\nv. Porter, 389 S.C. 27, 35, 698 S.E.2d 237, 241 (Ct. App. 2010) (requiring an\r\nappellant to cite authority in \"specific support of his assertion\"). Thus, to the\r\nextent Juror was impartial, the trial court did not err in refusing to excuse Juror.\r\n\r\nSection 14-7-1020 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2012) requires a trial judge,\r\nupon motion of either party, to determine whether a juror is impartial:\r\n\r\n             The court shall, on motion of either party in the suit,\r\n             examine on oath any person who is called as a juror to\r\n             know whether he is related to either party, has any\r\n             interest in the cause, has expressed or formed any\r\n             opinion, or is sensible of any bias or prejudice therein . . .\r\n             If it appears to the court that the juror is not indifferent in\r\n             the cause, he must be placed aside . . . and another must\r\n             be called.\r\n\r\nAccord State v. Cochran, 369 S.C. 308, 321, 631 S.E.2d 294, 301 (2006) (citing\r\nsection 14-7-1020). While such determinations are within the sound discretion of\r\nthe trial judge, \"[t]here is no rule of the common law, nor is there a statute\r\ndisqualifying a juror on account of his relationship to a witness, either by affinity\r\nor consanguinity, within any degree.\" State v. Burgess, 391 S.C. 15, 18, 703\r\n\nS.E.2d 512, 514 (Ct. App. 2010) (citation omitted); accord State v. Mercer, 381\r\nS.C. 149, 158, 672 S.E.2d 556, 560-61 (2009).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the mere fact that a juror's spouse is a law enforcement officer, who\r\nis not involved in the case, does not, in and of itself, render a juror biased and,\r\nthus, unable to serve on a jury; rather, the crux of that determination is whether it\r\n\"appears to the court that the juror is not indifferent in the cause.\" See § 14-7-1020\r\n(stating the trial judge must determine whether a proposed juror is related to either\r\nparty or is otherwise interested in, formed an opinion about, or is biased or\r\nprejudiced toward a party). Moreover, even jurors related by affinity or\r\nconsanguinity to a testifying witness or those who closely knew the putative victim\r\nof a crime are not, absent an inability to maintain impartiality, unqualified. See\r\nState v. Wells, 249 S.C. 249, 259-60, 153 S.E.2d 904, 909-10 (1967) (finding a\r\njuror who directly employed victim qualified); Burgess, 391 S.C. at 18, 703 S.E.2d\r\nat 514 (\"There is no rule of the common law, nor is there a statute disqualifying a\r\njuror on account of his relationship to a witness, either by affinity or consanguinity,\r\nwithin any degree.\" (citation omitted)).\r\n\r\nIn the instant matter, Juror was unrelated to the defendants and the potential\r\nwitnesses, and she did not know the victims; she was merely related to a non-\r\ntestifying law enforcement officer. Furthermore, once the trial judge learned\r\nJuror's husband was a reserve deputy, he asked Juror whether her husband's\r\nemployment would \"in any way affect [her] ability to give the [State] or [Jakes] . . .\r\na fair and an impartial trial.\" Juror confirmed \"it wouldn't.\" Because Juror\r\nappeared neither biased nor partial, the trial court did not err in finding Juror\r\nappeared impartial, despite her husband's status as a reserve deputy.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, because Juror did not conceal any information, partiality cannot be\r\nimputed to her on such a basis. State v. Woods, 345 S.C. 583, 588, 550 S.E.2d 282,\r\n284 (2001) (recognizing that a court may infer that a juror who intentionally\r\nconceals information inquired into is not impartial). \"[I]ntentional concealment\r\noccurs when the question presented to the jury on voir dire is reasonably\r\ncomprehensible to the average juror and the subject of the inquiry is of such\r\nsignificance that the juror's failure to respond is unreasonable.\" Id.\r\n\r\nAt the outset, Juror disclosed her husband's status as a law enforcement officer on\r\nher self-completed juror questionnaire. Thus, Juror unquestionably did not\r\nconceal her husband's occupation at this phase of the jury selection process.\r\nAdditionally, the trial judge asked no question during voir dire that required Juror\r\n\nto respond with her husband's occupation. While the trial judge did ask whether\r\nany potential juror was a member of law enforcement or was related to or a close\r\npersonal friend of the named potential witnesses, which did include some law\r\nenforcement officers, neither inquiry required Juror to disclose the employment\r\nstatus of her non-testifying husband. Moreover, while Jakes could have requested\r\nthe trial judge to ask whether any panel members were related to law enforcement\r\nofficers, Jakes concedes he made no such request. Because no voir dire question\r\nrequired Juror to respond with her husband's occupation, no concealment occurred\r\nand, thus, it cannot be inferred that juror was not impartial.2 See id. at 587, 550\r\nS.E.2d at 284 (requiring a new trial when an identified concealment of information\r\n(a) was intentional and (b) would have supported a challenge for cause or would\r\nhave been a material factor in the use of peremptory challenges). \"As we find no\r\nintentional concealment on Juror's part, we need not further determine whether the\r\ninformation would have been a material factor in the exercise of . . . peremptory\r\nstrikes.\" State v. Guillebeaux, 362 S.C. 270, 276, 607 S.E.2d 99, 102 (Ct. App.\r\n2004). Hence, the trial court did not err in refusing to dismiss Juror and to replace\r\nher with an alternate.              CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the decision of the circuit court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW C.J., and GEATHERS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2   Both parties conceded in their briefs that juror concealment did not exist.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-361","title":"McCarson v.

Poore, of Rock Hill, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Keith Fortenberry appeals the family court's decree of divorce,\r\narguing the court erred by (1) not addressing whether Sherry Fortenberry's attorney\r\nimproperly disbursed the net proceeds from the sale of the marital home; (2) not\r\nmaking findings of fact regarding Sherry's adultery; (3) using the minimum\r\nnumber of overnight visits in calculating child support based on a shared custody\r\n\nadjustment; (4) equally dividing the proceeds from the sale of the marital home; (5)\r\nincluding Sherry's bankruptcy debt in its equitable apportionment; (6) not\r\ndetermining whether Sherry's reaffirmation of her vehicle debt in bankruptcy court\r\ncreated a non-marital debt; (7) awarding the Remington rifle to Sherry without\r\ncrediting Keith with the value of the rifle; (8) awarding Sherry attorney's fees\r\nwithout making findings to support the award; and (9) ordering the parties to pay\r\nhalf of the fee owed to the guardian ad litem (GAL) without making findings to\r\nsupport the award. We affirm.\r\n\r\nTo the extent Keith claims Sherry's attorney lacked the authority to disburse the net\r\nproceeds from the sale of the marital home, we find the decree of divorce\r\nconstitutes a court order authorizing his actions. We need not address Keith's\r\nargument that this disbursement affects his ability to recover these funds if he\r\nprevails on appeal because we affirm all issues on appeal. See Arnal v. Arnal, 363\r\nS.C. 268, 288 n.8, 609 S.E.2d 821, 831 n.8 (Ct. App. 2005) (declining to address\r\nan issue when disposition of prior issues was dispositive).\r\n\r\nKeith argues the family court erred by not making a finding regarding Sherry's\r\nadultery. We disagree that this was error because such a finding would not affect\r\nthe outcome of this case. The court granted the parties what they sought—a\r\ndivorce—and \"granting a divorce . . . on the grounds of adultery would not\r\ndissolve the marriage any more completely.\" Griffith v. Griffith, 332 S.C. 630,\r\n642, 506 S.E.2d 526, 532 (Ct. App. 1998). Additionally, we find Keith abandoned\r\nany argument concerning the grounds for divorce. See Pittman v. Pittman, 395\r\nS.C. 209, 219, 717 S.E.2d 88, 93 (Ct. App. 2011) (holding appellant abandoned\r\nissue by failing to provide arguments or supporting authority). We also find Keith\r\nwaived the argument that adultery affects equitable apportionment because he\r\nconsented to an equal division of the marital property at trial. See Austin v. Stokes-\r\nCraven Holding Corp., 387 S.C. 22, 45-46, 691 S.E.2d 135, 147 (2010) (declining\r\nto review an issue when appellant conceded it at trial).\r\n\r\nAs to whether a finding of adultery affects the award of attorney's fees, \"[a] party's\r\nfault in causing a divorce . . . is not a factor to be considered when awarding\r\nattorney's fees.\" Doe v. Doe, 370 S.C. 206, 219, 634 S.E.2d 51, 58 (Ct. App.\r\n2006). Although fault can be considered if substantial fees and costs \"would not\r\nhave been incurred but for [a party]'s fault in the breakdown of the marriage,\"\r\nReiss v. Reiss, 392 S.C. 198, 211, 708 S.E.2d 799, 806 (Ct. App. 2011), (1) we find\r\nthe adultery occurred post-separation and thus did not cause the breakdown of the\r\n\nmarriage,1 see Martin v. Martin, 296 S.C. 436, 442, 373 S.E.2d 706, 710 (Ct. App.\r\n1998) (finding it appropriate not to consider fault when wife's post-separation\r\nadultery did not affect the marriage), and (2) there is no evidence Sherry's adultery\r\ncaused an increase in the cost of litigation. In fact, her admission of adultery\r\nminimized litigation costs by obviating any investigation into the existence of\r\nadultery. A finding of adultery would also not affect the award of the GAL's fee.2\r\nSee Doe, 370 S.C. at 220, 634 S.E.2d at 59 (stating the same factors applicable to\r\nawarding attorney's fees also apply to awarding litigation expenses).\r\n\r\nIn calculating child support based on the shared custody adjustment, Keith argues\r\nthe family court should have made an exact determination of the amount of\r\novernight visits. We find that as a practical matter, the visitation schedule does not\r\nallow for such a determination because the number of overnight visits is subject to\r\nchange depending on (1) Keith's work schedule, (2) how the parties decide to share\r\nThanksgiving and spring break holidays, and (3) what weeks Keith chooses for\r\nsummer visitations. Regarding the court's use of 110 overnight visits—the\r\nminimum number of visits possible under the visitation schedule—we find no\r\nerror. The family court may apply the shared custody adjustment when each\r\nparent has more than 109 overnight visitations per year. S.C. Code Ann. Regs.\r\n114-4730(A) (2012). The adjustment reduces a non-custodial parent's child\r\nsupport obligation in proportion to the amount of visitation awarded because the\r\nnon-custodial parent will likely pay for most of the children's needs during this\r\ntime. Roy T. Stuckey, Marital Litigation in South Carolina, 605-06 (3d ed. 2007);\r\nsee also Floyd v. Morgan, 375 S.C. 246, 254, 652 S.E.2d 83, 88 (Ct. App. 2007),\r\nrev'd on other grounds, 383 S.C. 469, 681 S.E.2d 570 (2009). Thus, the court's use\r\nof the minimum number of overnight visits increased Keith's support payments.\r\nHowever, we find the court did not err because using 110 overnight visits\r\nsafeguards against Sherry receiving an insufficient amount of child support, which\r\nis in the best interest of the children. See Reg. 114-4730(A) (stating family court\r\nmust ensure that using the adjustment \"does not produce a substantial negative\r\neffect on the child(ren)'s standard of living\").\r\n\r\n1 Although the GAL testified Sherry's affair had an impact on the separation, the\r\nfamily court was entitled to decide otherwise. See Shirley v. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324,\r\n339, 536 S.E.2d 427, 435 (Ct. App. 2000) (\"The role of the [GAL] . . . is to aid, not\r\ndirect, the court. Ultimately, the . . . decision lies with the trial judge.\").\r\n2 While there is evidence the GAL's fee may have increased based on the GAL's\r\ninvestigation into the extent of the affair before separation, there is no evidence\r\nthis investigation substantially increased the fee.\r\n\nAs to the court's equitable apportionment of the marital estate, we disagree that the\r\nfamily court erred by equally dividing the proceeds from the sale of the marital\r\nhome, although its initial instructions for preparation of the decree of divorce\r\nstated otherwise. See McComb v. McComb, 394 S.C. 416, 426, 715 S.E.2d 662,\r\n667 (Ct. App. 2011) (stating \"[u]ntil written and entered, the trial judge retains\r\ndiscretion to change his mind and amend his . . . ruling\" (citation omitted)). As to\r\nthe court's apportionment of Sherry's $5900 bankruptcy debt, we find Keith did not\r\nmeet his burden of proving what portion of the debt was non-marital. See Wooten\r\nv. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 547, 615 S.E.2d 98, 105 (2005) (stating the burden of\r\nproving a debt incurred prior to marital litigation is non-marital rests on the party\r\nwho makes that assertion). We also affirm because Keith failed to produce a\r\nrecord on appeal that enables this court to determine what amount of the debt was\r\nnon-marital. See Perry v. Perry, 301 S.C. 147, 151, 390 S.E.2d 480, 482 (Ct. App.\r\n1990) (stating appellant must provide \"a sufficient record on appeal from which\r\nthis Court can make an intelligent review\"); see also Bryson v. Bryson, 378 S.C.\r\n502, 510, 662 S.E.2d 611, 615 (Ct. App. 2008) (affirming because appellant \"failed\r\nto provide a sufficient record\").\r\n\r\nWe do not address whether Sherry's reaffirmation of her vehicle's debt in\r\nbankruptcy court created a non-marital debt because Keith never argued this at\r\ntrial. Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. P'ship, 359 S.C. 505, 511, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715\r\n(2004) (stating appellate court cannot address an issue not raised to and ruled upon\r\nby the family court).\r\n\r\nAs to Keith's argument that the family court erred in awarding the rifle to Sherry\r\nbecause doing so was contrary to the court's instructions regarding preparation of\r\nthe decree of divorce, we find no error. See McComb, 394 S.C. at 426, 715 S.E.2d\r\nat 667. Also, because Sherry requested possession of the rifle and Keith\r\naffirmatively stated he had no objection, there is no basis to claim the court did not\r\nintend to grant her request. Regarding Keith's assertion that he never received\r\ncredit for giving the rifle to Sherry, Keith failed to provide a record on appeal\r\nsufficient to enable this court to determine whether he is owed a $300 credit, see\r\nPerry, 301 S.C. at 151, 390 S.E.2d at 482, and if so, whether an error of the court\r\ncaused this result. See Doe, 370 S.C. at 217, 634 S.E.2d at 57 (declining to address\r\na conclusory argument that failed to show how the family court erred).\r\n\nKeith argues the family court erred in awarding Sherry $2500 in attorney's fees\r\nwithout making findings regarding the factors to support the award.3 We agree\r\nwith Keith that the court did not address each of the factors for entitlement to\r\nattorney's fees, see E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816\r\n(1992) (listing factors for entitlement to attorney's fees), and that in this respect the\r\ncourt's order failed to \"set forth specific findings of fact\" in accordance with Rule\r\n26(a), SCRFC. However, reversal is not necessary because the appellate court may\r\nmake its own findings of fact if the record on appeal is sufficient to allow the court\r\nto do so. Haselden v. Haselden, 347 S.C. 48, 66, 552 S.E.2d 329, 338 (Ct. App.\r\n2001). The family court found Sherry prevailed on the main issue at trial and\r\nfound neither party had the means to pay a substantial award of attorney's fees.\r\nBased on these findings and the record on appeal, we find Sherry was entitled to\r\nattorney's fees. Although Sherry earns approximately $775 more than Keith on a\r\nmonthly basis, the court required her to provide medical insurance and day care for\r\nthe children, totaling $1,183 per month, which is more than Keith's child support\r\nand dental insurance payments of $742. Also, the court ordered the attorney's fee\r\naward to be paid from the proceeds of the sale of the home, and thus the award\r\nshould have little effect on Keith's current standard of living or his financial\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nAs to the GAL's fee, Keith argues the family court erred in ordering the parties to\r\npay half the GAL's fee. Although the family court did not make findings regarding\r\nthe factors to support the award, and to that extent the court erred, the record on\r\nappeal is sufficient to allow this court to make these findings. See Haselden, 347\r\nS.C. at 66, 552 S.E.2d at 338. As discussed above, the award should have little\r\neffect on the parties' current standard of living and respective financial conditions\r\nbecause it was paid from the parties' shares of the proceeds of the sale of the home.\r\nSecond, dividing the fee equally is reasonable. See Marquez v. Caudill, 376 S.C.\r\n229, 250, 656 S.E.2d 737, 747 (2008) (affirming the family court's equal division\r\nof the GAL's fee because it was reasonable). Keith argues we should remand the\r\nissue because the record does not contain the amount of the GAL's fee. However,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Keith appeals only Sherry's entitlement to attorney's fees, not the amount\r\nawarded. Thus, we need not address the reasonableness of the fee. See Simpson v.\r\nSimpson, 377 S.C. 527, 539, 660 S.E.2d 278, 285 (Ct. App. 2008) (addressing only\r\nentitlement to attorney's fees when appellant appealed the propriety of awarding\r\nthe fee, not the reasonableness of the amount).\r\n\nKeith had the burden to include this amount in the record, which he failed to do.4\r\nSee Perry, 301 S.C. at 151, 390 S.E.2d at 482. Giving deference to the court's\r\nfinding that the fee was reasonable and considering Keith's failure to provide a\r\nsufficient record, we affirm and find the court acted within its discretion in\r\ndividing the GAL's fee equally between the parties.\r\n\r\nFinally, the record supports the court's finding that \"Neither party contested the fee\r\nstatement submitted by the GAL.\" According to the record, neither party objected\r\nto the GAL's fee at trial, and Keith did not contest the amount or move for a fee\r\naffidavit in his 59(e), SCRCP, motion. He argues the court erred in making this\r\nfinding because the GAL did not submit a fee statement at trial, which provided\r\nhim no opportunity to contest the fee. We find that no error of the court caused\r\nthis result, as Keith did not ask the GAL to submit a fee statement at trial, request a\r\nfinal billing from the GAL, or request a hearing before the court on the issue. See\r\nThomson v. Thomson, 377 S.C. 613, 625, 661 S.E.2d 130, 136-37 (Ct. App. 2008)\r\n(\"[A] party cannot sit back at trial . . . then come to this Court complaining of the\r\ninsufficiency of the evidence to support the family court's findings.\" (alteration in\r\noriginal) (citation omitted)).\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., KONDUROS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4Although Keith claims that \"[t]o this day, [he] does not know the amount of the\r\n[GAL]'s fee,\" he does not contest Sherry's assertion that the GAL issued interim\r\nbillings throughout litigation and sent out his final billing at the conclusion of trial.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-365","title":"Atlantic Coast Properties v.

We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR,\r\nand the following authorities:\r\n\r\n1.     As to the family court's refusal to order a permanent modification of the\r\nvisitation granted to Respondent in a prior custody order: Wilburn v. Wilburn, 403\r\nS.C. 375, 380, 743 S.E.2d 734, 738 (2013) (acknowledging the appellate court\r\n\"exercises de novo review over appeals in family court cases,\" but further stating\r\n\"the decision of the family court will be upheld unless the Court finds that a\r\npreponderance of the evidence weighs against the family court's decision\");\r\nLatimer v. Farmer, 360 S.C. 375, 381, 602 S.E.2d 32, 35 (2004) (recognizing a\r\nchange in custody analysis includes consideration of the child's best interest, but\r\nadhering to the principle that the party seeking to change custody must also show a\r\nchange in circumstances occurring after the entry of the prior custody order); Pitt\r\nv. Olds, 333 S.C. 478, 481, 511 S.E.2d 60, 61 (1999) (\"In order for a court to\r\nmodify an existing custody decree, there must be a showing of changed\r\ncircumstances occurring subsequent to the entry of the decree.\").\r\n\r\n2.     As to whether the family court erred in ordering Appellant to pay both\r\nRespondent's attorney's fees and the Guardian ad litem's fees in full: Chisholm v.\r\nChisholm, 396 S.C. 507, 510, 722 S.E.2d 222, 223 (2012) (stating that although an\r\nappellate court exercises de novo review of attorney's fees awards in domestic\r\nrelations cases, the appellant must show the preponderance of the evidence is\r\nagainst the family court's findings of fact); Miles v. Miles, 393 S.C. 111, 120, 711\r\nS.E.2d 880, 885 (2011) (noting the party seeking modification of a child support\r\nobligation bears the burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that an\r\nunforeseen change has occurred and that the change is substantial); Simpson v.\r\nSimpson, 377 S.C. 527, 538-40, 660 S.E.2d 278, 284-85 (Ct. App. 2008) (affirming\r\nan award of attorney's fees and costs that was approximately eighty-three percent\r\nof the appellant's potential annual income); Hawkins v. Hawkins, 403 S.C. 228,\r\n242, 742 S.E.2d 677, 684 (Ct. App. 2013) (indicating the family court should\r\nconsider the supporting spouse's earning potential when that spouse seeks to reduce\r\na support obligation based on diminished income). We further note that although\r\nwe do not approve of the grant of attorney's fees in lieu of child support,\r\nAppellant's counsel stated to this court that he was not appealing the family court's\r\n\ndesignation of attorney's fees as an incident of child support. Based on this\r\nassurance, we decline to address the propriety of the family court's fashioning of\r\nawards of attorney's fees and Guardian ad litem's fees as support obligations for the\r\npurpose of avoiding their discharge in a bankruptcy proceeding.

Biering,\r\n            Attorney at Law, P.C., of Moncks Corner, for\r\n            Respondents.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this breach of contract action, Stolf Construction, LLC (Stolf)\r\nappeals the trial court's order finding \"in favor of [Sweetgrass Home Builders,\r\n\nLLC, and Reginald L. Gaskins] on all causes of action,\" and denying Stolf's motion\r\nfor a new trial. Stolf argues the trial court erred in (1) finding it lacked standing,\r\n(2) finding it did not present an accounting of a prior construction contract, (3)\r\nfinding Sweetgrass was a properly formed limited liability company, and (4)\r\ndenying its motion for a new trial. We affirm.\r\n\r\nThe evidence contained in the record shows Stolf did not have a residential\r\nbuilder's license at the time the contract was executed. Accordingly, the trial court\r\nproperly found Stolf lacked standing to bring this action. See S.C. Code Ann.\r\n§ 40-59-30(B) (2011) (\"[A] person or firm who first has not procured a license or\r\nregistered with the [South Carolina Residential Builders Commission] and is\r\nrequired to do so by law may not file a mechanics' lien or bring an action at law or\r\nin equity to enforce the provisions of a contract for residential building or\r\nresidential specialty contracting which the person or firm entered into in violation\r\nof this chapter.\"); Duckworth v. Cameron, 270 S.C. 647, 649, 244 S.E.2d 217, 218\r\n(1978) (\"Any builder who violates [section 40-59-30(B)] by entering into a\r\ncontract for home construction without obtaining the required license simply\r\ncannot enforce the contract.\").\r\n\r\nBecause we affirm the trial court's finding that Stolf lacked standing, we need not\r\naddress the remaining issues. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc.,\r\n335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (noting an appellate court need not\r\naddress remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.1\r\n\r\nHUFF, GEATHERS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1   We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-376","title":"State v.

We affirm.\r\n\n1. We find the master did not err in awarding $528.50 in reasonable court costs to\r\nthe Adams. Although the Adams allege the master erred in denying reasonable\r\ncourt costs, they abandoned this issue by failing to cite to any law or authority in\r\nsupport of their argument. See D.R. Horton, Inc. v. Wescott Land Co., LLC, 398\r\nS.C. 528, 548-49, 730 S.E.2d 340, 350-51 (Ct. App. 2012) (holding an appellant\r\nabandoned an issue by failing to cite any law or authority in support of their\r\nargument and making only conclusory arguments).\r\n\r\n2. We find the master properly denied damages to the Adams. Alexander Farm\r\nRoad runs through McCager Alexander's and Louis Nexsen's properties and\r\ndelineates their property line. The properties of all three parties, including the\r\nAdams, were once owned by the same person as one tract of land. The Adamses'\r\nrecorded deed from 1998 references a recorded plat, which depicts an easement\r\nnamed Alexander Farm Road. The master concluded the Adams acquired a\r\nprescriptive easement on Alexander Farm Road by either adverse use or by claim\r\nof right and the easement met the requirements of an easement from necessity.\r\nHowever, the master found neither the Adams, Nexsen, nor Alexander could\r\nrecover damages because all parties were at fault for placing gates or obstacles to\r\nblock the easement.\r\n\r\n\"The determination of the existence of an easement is a question of fact in a law\r\naction and subject to an any evidence standard of review when tried by a [circuit\r\ncourt] without a jury.\" Hardy v. Aiken, 369 S.C. 160, 165, 631 S.E.2d 539, 541\r\n(2006) (citation omitted). \"Our scope of review for a case heard by a [m]aster-in-\r\n[e]quity who enters a final judgment is the same as that for review of a case heard\r\nby a circuit court without a jury.\" Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229,\r\n237, 391 S.E.2d 538, 543 (1989). \"In an action at law, we will affirm the master's\r\nfactual findings if there is any evidence in the record which reasonably supports\r\nthem.\" Query v. Burgess, 371 S.C. 407, 410, 639 S.E.2d 455, 456 (Ct. App. 2006)\r\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\nHere, the record contains evidence to support the master's finding that all parties\r\nwere at fault for obstructing the easement. See id. Although Alexander and\r\nNexsen dumped gravel and rocks on the road two times, the Adams admitted to\r\nbuilding at least three different obstructions that prevented Alexander and Nexsen\r\nfrom using Alexander Farm Road. Specifically, the Adams installed steel posts,\r\nchain link gates, and a steel gate with a combination lock on Alexander Farm\r\nRoad. Accordingly, we hold the record supports the master's findings.\r\n\nAFFIRMED.1\n\r\n\r\nHUFF, GEATHERS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1   We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-385","title":"State v.

Byrd maintains the circuit court\r\nerred in (1) submitting Johnson's claims for libel and slander to the jury in\r\nderogation of section 33-56-180 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2012), which\r\nbars recovery against individual employees of a charitable institution and (2)\r\nentering judgment against Byrd in his individual capacity when the jury did not\r\nexpressly find that he acted outside the scope and course of his employment.

In\r\nboth of his arguments on appeal, Byrd argues the circuit court submitted a verdict\r\nform that was inadequate to establish liability against Byrd individually. However,\r\nat the conclusion of trial, the circuit court repeatedly asked counsel for both sides\r\nwhether they had any objections to the format of the verdict form. Byrd's counsel\r\nrepeatedly responded that he had \"no objection\" to the verdict form. Further, there\r\nwas no reference to section 33-56-180 in any of Byrd's directed verdict motions.\r\nAccordingly, we find that Byrd failed to raise his current arguments to the circuit\r\ncourt and is therefore barred from raising these issues for the first time on appeal.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-389","title":"Mosley v.

(Mother) appeals from the family court's order of\r\nintervention, arguing the court changed and added terms to the parties' agreement\r\nthat were not agreed upon. We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the\r\nfollowing authorities:\r\n\r\n1.     Mother argues the family court erred in allowing Father to begin visitation\r\nimmediately with Children because the parties' agreement was to permit the\r\ntherapist to begin Children's therapy immediately with the discretion to allow\r\nFather to attend therapeutic visitation if the therapist deemed the visitation\r\nappropriate. We find no error with the family court's final order with regard to the\r\nprovision concerning Father's visitation because the court interpreted the\r\nagreement in light of the parties' situation and their purposes in entering into the\r\nagreement. See Mattox v. Cassady, 289 S.C. 57, 61, 344 S.E.2d 620, 622 (Ct. App.\r\n1986) (holding that to ascertain the parties' intentions to a settlement agreement,\r\nthe court should attempt to determine the situation of the parties and their purposes\r\nat the time the contract was entered). During the hearing, Father stated that \"in\r\nterms of the therapeutic visitation under the direction of [Children's therapist], that\r\nwould be effective immediately . . . subject to [Children's therapist's] guidance.\"\r\nThe family court asked Mother whether she agreed with this provision, and Mother\r\nstated she understood Children would see the therapist immediately, but that\r\ntherapeutic visitation would not begin until Children's therapist deemed it\r\nappropriate. Mother did not object when Father stated on the record that the\r\nparties agreed Children's therapist would be the \"gatekeeper of any and all\r\nconcerns of the children or the parents as it relates to visitation.\" The final order\r\nstates that Children's therapist \"shall determine the course of reunification\" and\r\nvisitation \"will begin with therapeutic visitation at [Children's therapist's office]\r\nwhen she deems it appropriate.\"1 The final order also provides Mother may\r\npetition the family court to review the issue of visitation at any time, which gives\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 At oral argument, Father conceded the final order does not go beyond therapeutic\r\nvisitation, and if Father wants more than therapeutic visitation with Children, he\r\nwill have to petition the court.\r\n\nMother a remedy if therapeutic visitation becomes problematic. Thus, the final\r\norder gives effect to Mother's intentions for visitation because Father cannot have\r\nvisitation with Children until Children's therapist deems it appropriate.\r\n\r\n2.      Mother argues the family court improperly divested its authority to\r\nChildren's therapist by allowing her to determine the visitation plan. In Stefan v.\r\nStefan, 320 S.C. 419, 421-22, 465 S.E.2d 734, 736 (Ct. App. 1995), the family\r\ncourt directed that the guardian ad litem's (GAL's) approval would be required\r\nbefore the father could resume visiting his children, and the GAL could\r\nrecommend any changes in visitation. This court found the family court erred in\r\ndelegating the responsibility of creating a visitation plan to the GAL and the\r\nparenting specialist. Id. Additionally, this court noted the family court erred in\r\nsuspending the father's visitation rights without a GAL's recommendation that it\r\nwould be in the children's best interest. Id. at 423, 465 S.E.2d at 737. We find this\r\ncase is distinguishable from Stefan because the family court's approval of the\r\nparties' settlement agreement does not equate to a delegation of the family court's\r\n\"authority and responsibility for protecting the interest of minors involved in\r\nlitigation.\" See id. at 422, 465 S.E.2d at 736. Here, Mother and Father, not the\r\nfamily court, made the decision to allow Children's therapist to determine Father's\r\ntherapeutic visitation with Children. The parties' agreement was placed on the\r\nrecord, attested to by both parties, and approved in its entirety by the family court\r\nas being in the best interests of the children. Furthermore, the order provides the\r\nparties may petition the family court at any time to review Father's progress with\r\nvisitation. Thus, the family court has retained authority to make changes to\r\nFather's visitation.\r\n\r\n3.     Mother argues she agreed for Linda Hutton to replace Children's prior\r\ncounselor and for Children to have adequate closure with their prior counselor;\r\nhowever, the court adopted language that was different from the agreement stated\r\nin the transcript.2 We find no error with the family court's final order with regard\r\nto the provision concerning Children's therapist because the court interpreted it in\r\nlight of the parties' purposes in entering into the agreement. See Nicholson v.\r\nNicholson, 378 S.C. 523, 532, 663 S.E.2d 74, 79 (Ct. App. 2008) (holding the\r\nfamily court's only function with an agreement that is clear and capable of legal\r\nconstruction is to interpret its lawful meaning and the intention of the parties as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 At oral argument, Father informed the court that Hutton is no longer Children's\r\ntherapist, and the family court has appointed a new therapist for Children.\r\n\nfound within the agreement and to give them effect). The parties agreed on the\r\nrecord that Hutton would replace Meredith Thompson-Loftis as Children's\r\ncounselor, and the final order provides that \"Hutton shall be the exclusive therapist\r\nfor the minor [C]hildren, providing counseling and therapy for [C]hildren, and\r\nimmediately replacing [Thompson-Loftis], who is [C]hildren's current therapist.\"\r\nFurther, the order provides for one joint meeting with both therapists and Children\r\n\"to ensure a smooth transition for the minor [C]hildren.\" Thus, the final order\r\ngives effect to Mother's intentions concerning the replacement of Children's\r\ntherapist.\r\n\r\n4.      Mother argues the parties agreed Children's therapist could suggest therapy\r\nfor Mother, but the family court's order incorrectly mandated that Mother must\r\nattend therapy. We find no error with the family court's final order with regard to\r\nthe provision concerning Mother's therapy because the court interpreted it in light\r\nof the parties' situation and their purposes in entering into the agreement. See\r\nMarshall v. Marshall, 282 S.C. 336, 342, 318 S.E.2d 133, 137 (Ct. App. 1984)\r\n(\"As with any other contract, where the language of a marital agreement is\r\nsusceptible of more than one interpretation, it is the duty of the Family Court Judge\r\nto ascertain the intentions of the parties.\"). The final order provides that \"Mother\r\nshall participate [in] any psychological or psychiatric assessment recommended by\r\n[Children's therapist].\" (Emphasis added.) Mother argues the family court should\r\nnot have ordered her to attend therapy. However, during the hearing, Father stated\r\n\"[Children's therapist] will also have the role and the right to suggest if [Mother]\r\nshould seek out further psychological or psychiatric assessment.\" (Emphasis\r\nadded.) Mother did not object to this requirement. The family court concluded the\r\nparties vested Children's therapist with significant responsibility in reunifying\r\nFather and Children, and Children's therapist could determine if Mother's therapy\r\nwould better serve Children's needs. The family court also found the agreement,\r\nwhich was endorsed by the GAL, was in the best interest of Children and reflected\r\na fair resolution of the legal issues. Accordingly, the final order gives effect to the\r\nparties' intentions concerning Children's therapist's role in addressing Children's\r\ntherapeutic needs.\r\n\r\n5.     Mother argues the family court abused its discretion by initially refusing to\r\nadopt the restraining order against Father. Although the family court neglected to\r\ninclude a restraining order against Father in the final order, the family court\r\nprepared a supplemental order to include the restraining order. Accordingly, we\r\nfind the family court properly addressed Mother's concerns about the lack of a\r\nrestraining order, and this issue is moot. See Seabrook v. Knox, 369 S.C. 191, 197,\r\n631 S.E.2d 907, 910 (2006) (\"A moot case exists where a judgment rendered by\r\n\nthe court will have no practical legal effect upon an existing controversy because\r\nan intervening event renders any grant of effectual relief impossible for the\r\nreviewing court.\"); id. (\"If there is no actual controversy, this Court will not decide\r\nmoot or academic questions.\").\r\n\r\n6.     Mother argues the family court erred in finding she freely and voluntarily\r\nentered into the agreement. Mother raised this issue for the first time during the\r\nhearing on her motion to reconsider. She argued she was poorly represented by her\r\nattorney, she was coerced into settling the case, and she generally did not\r\nunderstand what she was doing when she agreed to the terms set forth in the order.\r\nHowever, during the December 13, 2011 hearing, Mother stated she agreed with\r\nthe terms and provisions of the agreement, and she wanted the court to approve the\r\nagreement. She also stated she was satisfied with her attorney's services.\r\nTherefore, we find the court correctly found Mother freely and voluntarily entered\r\ninto the agreement. See Forsythe v. Forsythe, 290 S.C. 253, 255-56, 349 S.E.2d\r\n405, 406 (Ct. App. 1986) (holding the family court properly found the wife entered\r\ninto an agreement freely and voluntarily because there was no evidence the\r\nagreement was not freely and voluntarily entered into: wife answered affirmatively\r\nthat she understood the agreement, had entered into it of her own free will and\r\naccord, was not under duress or fear, and was satisfied with the services of her\r\nlawyer).\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nSHORT and THOMAS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-393","title":"State v.

Jones asserts the trial court erred in (1) refusing to charge\r\nvoluntary manslaughter based on the evidence presented at trial; (2) refusing to\r\ncharge the jury that unlawful possession of a weapon does not preclude a finding\r\nof self-defense; and (3) allowing the State to present expert testimony about gangs\r\nin reply. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1.     We first find the trial court properly declined to charge voluntary\r\nmanslaughter based on the evidence presented. \"Voluntary manslaughter is the\r\nintentional and unlawful killing of a human being in sudden heat of passion upon\r\nsufficient legal provocation.\" State v. Smith, 391 S.C. 408, 412-13, 706 S.E.2d 12,\r\n14 (2011). \"For a defendant to be entitled to a voluntary manslaughter charge,\r\nthere must be evidence of both sufficient legal provocation and heat of passion at\r\nthe time of the killing.\" Id. at 413, 706 S.E.2d at 15. \"The sudden heat of passion,\r\nupon sufficient legal provocation, while it need not dethrone reason entirely, or\r\nshut out knowledge and volition, must be such as would naturally disturb the sway\r\nof reason, render the mind of an ordinary person incapable of cool reflection, and\r\nproduce what, according to human experience, may be called an uncontrollable\r\nimpulse to do violence.\" Id. \"[A] defendant is not entitled to [a] voluntary\r\nmanslaughter [charge] merely because he was legally provoked.\" State v. Starnes,\r\n388 S.C. 590, 597, 698 S.E.2d 604, 608 (2010). \"Moreover, there must be\r\nevidence that the heat of passion was caused by sufficient legal provocation.\" Id.\r\nThough one's fear immediately following an attack or threatening act may cause\r\nthe person to act in a sudden heat of passion, the mere fact that one is afraid is not\r\nsufficient, by itself, to entitle a defendant to a voluntary manslaughter charge. Id.\r\nat 598, 698 S.E.2d at 609. \"[I]n order to constitute 'sudden heat of passion upon\r\nsufficient legal provocation,' the fear must be the result of sufficient legal\r\nprovocation and cause the defendant to lose control and create an uncontrollable\r\nimpulse to do violence.\" Id. \"Succinctly stated, to warrant a voluntary\r\nmanslaughter charge, the defendant's fear must manifest itself in an uncontrollable\r\nimpulse to do violence.\" Id. at 598-99, 698 S.E.2d at 609.\r\n\r\nJones arguably presented evidence of sufficient legal provocation. However,\r\nJones' own testimony indicated that he did not shoot Vincent because he was\r\nenraged, was incapable of \"cool reflection,\" or was acting under \"an uncontrollable\r\nimpulse to do violence.\" No evidence was presented that Jones was acting in a\r\nsudden heat of passion when he shot Vincent. Rather, Jones' testimony makes\r\nclear that he shot Vincent solely in self-defense or in defense of his girlfriend.\r\nThus, the evidence shows Jones intentionally shot Vincent, and he did so either\r\nwith malice aforethought, or in defense of himself or others. See Starnes, 388 S.C.\r\n\nat 599, 698 S.E.2d at 609 (\"A person may act in a deliberate, controlled manner,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that he is afraid or in fear. Conversely, a person can be\r\nacting under an uncontrollable impulse to do violence and be incapable of cool\r\nreflection as a result of fear. The latter situation constitutes sudden heat of passion,\r\nbut the former does not. . . . Turning to the facts of this case, viewing the evidence\r\nin the light most favorable to Appellant, there is no evidence to support a voluntary\r\nmanslaughter charge. . . . While [there is evidence] Appellant was in fear, there is\r\nno evidence Appellant was out of control as a result of his fear or was acting under\r\nan uncontrollable impulse to do violence. The only evidence in the record is that\r\nAppellant deliberately and intentionally shot [the two victims] and that he either\r\nshot the men with malice aforethought or in self-defense.\").\r\n\r\n2.     We also find no merit to Jones' argument the trial judge erred in refusing to\r\ncharge the jury that unlawful possession of a weapon does not necessarily preclude\r\na finding that appellant acted in self-defense. The record reflects trial counsel\r\nrequested a charge that \"the possession of an unlawful weapon does not preclude [a\r\ndefendant] from self-defense — does not bar a self-defense charge,\" citing the case\r\nof State v. Slater, 373 S.C. 66, 644 S.E.2d 50 (2007). The trial court noted that, in\r\nSlater, self-defense was not charged, but self-defense had been charged in this\r\nmatter. The court therefore declined to give the requested charge. The trial court\r\nthereafter thoroughly charged the jury on the elements of self-defense and various\r\naspects of self-defense law pertinent to the circumstances of this case, such as the\r\nright to act on appearances, prior instances of violence by the victim, prior threats\r\nby the victim, and the right to act in self-preservation to avoid the victim getting\r\nthe drop.\r\n\r\nAssuming arguendo that Jones made a timely request for the instruction, we find\r\nno error. Jones relies on Slater and State v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 513 S.E.2d 104\r\n(1999) in support of his position that he was entitled to the charge. Slater and\r\nBurriss admittedly provide that the unlawful possession of a weapon alone will not\r\nnecessarily foreclose a defense of accident, involuntary manslaughter, or self-\r\ndefense, because one who is in unlawful possession of a weapon may, under the\r\nproper circumstances, lawfully arm himself in self-defense. Slater, 373 S.C. at 70-\r\n71, 644 S.E.2d at 52-53; Burriss, 334 S.C. at 262, 265, 513 S.E.2d at 108, 109.\r\nHowever, the issues in those cases dealt with whether or not a self-defense charge\r\n(Slater) or an accident or involuntary manslaughter charge (Burriss) was\r\nappropriate under the circumstances, noting one in unlawful possession of a\r\nweapon may be lawfully armed in self-defense. See Slater, 373 S.C. at 71, 644\r\nS.E.2d at 53 (\"[W]here the defendant's unlawful possession of a weapon is merely\r\n\nincidental to the defendant's lawful act of arming himself in self-defense, the\r\nunlawful possession of the weapon will not prevent the use of an accident\r\ndefense.\"); Burriss, 334 S.C. at 262, 513 S.E.2d at 108 (\"[A] person can be acting\r\nlawfully, even if he is in unlawful possession of a weapon, if he was entitled to arm\r\nhimself in self-defense at the time of the shooting.\"). Slater and Burriss do not\r\naddress whether one would be entitled to a jury charge that unlawful possession of\r\na weapon would not necessarily bar a finding that a defendant acted in self-\r\ndefense. In other words, the law was addressed in these cases solely in\r\ndetermining whether self-defense or accident charges were appropriate, and not\r\nwhether a separate charge to the jury — that one being in unlawful possession of a\r\nweapon would not necessarily bar self-defense —– was required. Research reveals\r\nno South Carolina case law finding such to be a required charge to the jury.\r\nRather, such law is cited in regard to a determination of whether one is entitled to a\r\nself-defense, accident or involuntary manslaughter charge when the circumstances\r\ninclude that the defendant was in unlawful possession of a weapon. See In re\r\nTracy B., 391 S.C. 51, 71, 704 S.E.2d 71, 81 (Ct. App. 2010) (noting, although\r\nunlawful possession of a weapon alone does not automatically bar a self-defense\r\ncharge, it is evidence of an unlawful activity which can preclude the assertion of\r\nself-defense).\r\n\r\nWe find no error. The fact that the jury was charged on self-defense is an\r\nindication in and of itself that the unlawful possession of a weapon does not\r\nnecessarily preclude a finding of self-defense. Additionally, much of the argument\r\nrelied upon by Jones in his appeal was never raised to the trial court. Specifically,\r\nJones did not argue to the trial court, as he does on appeal, that the rulings in Slater\r\nand Burris should be extended to require the jury be charged in this manner.\r\nFurther, as noted by the State, Jones never pointed to the closing argument of the\r\nState as mandating such a charge at the trial level as he does on appeal. See State\r\nv. Freiburger, 366 S.C. 125, 134, 620 S.E.2d 737, 741 (2005) (finding argument\r\nadvanced on appeal was not raised and ruled on below and therefore was not\r\npreserved for review).\r\n\r\n3.    Finally, we find no reversible error in the admission of testimony from the\r\nwitness qualified as an expert on gangs. Jones argues the trial court erred in\r\nallowing the expert to testify generally about gangs in reply because the crimes for\r\nwhich he was on trial were not gang related and he already admitted he had\r\nformerly been involved with a gang, making the testimony irrelevant and highly\r\nprejudicial. Citing Rule 403, SCRE, Jones maintains, even if the expert's\r\ntestimony was proper reply testimony in response to his testimony that he was no\r\n\nlonger involved with a gang, the prejudicial impact of such testimony outweighed\r\nany purported probative value. We disagree.\r\n\r\nOn cross-examination, Jones admitted that five red bandannas, located under a\r\nmattress in his room along with a box of bullets, belonged to him. The State\r\nshowed Jones a picture and questioned him concerning gang graffiti found in a\r\nstorage room where he lived. Jones testified he was not responsible for the graffiti\r\ninside the storage room, but claimed it was done by one of his friends. The graffiti\r\nincluded words or symbols meaning \"Life\" and \"Blood,\" along with \"Nine,\"\r\n\"Trey,\" and \"Gangstas.\" Jones acknowledged that \"Nine Trey Gangstas\" was\r\nwritten together, and that it indicated a \"blood gang.\" Jones claimed to know\r\n\"Nine Trey Gangstas\" was a blood gang because he had friends who were a part of\r\nit, but he denied that he was part of it. Jones acknowledged he had the initials\r\n\"NTG\" tattooed on his arm, which stood for \"Nine Trey Gangstas,\" a blood gang.\r\nHe again denied, however, being a member of a blood gang. When asked why he\r\nwould have the tattoo on his arm if he were not a member, Jones replied, \"Because\r\nI was a part of it.\" He denied, however, that he was still a member. The solicitor\r\nthen asked Jones if gangs were \"for life,\" and Jones stated, \"I guess so if you would\r\ncall it that.\" Jones testified he became involved with the blood gang around the\r\nage of fourteen or fifteen, and did so because he was hanging around the wrong\r\ncrowd. All of this gang evidence was admitted without objection from the defense.\r\n\r\nWhen the solicitor then asked Jones how he became a member of the gang, defense\r\ncounsel objected to the line of questioning based on relevancy, and a bench\r\nconference was held off the record. When questioning resumed,1 Jones agreed he\r\njoined the gang when he was fourteen or fifteen years old and the shooting\r\noccurred when he was seventeen years old, but he continued to insist he was no\r\nlonger a part of the gang, claiming he stopped being a member when he was\r\nsixteen years old. Jones also denied having a conversation in front of Crystal's\r\ncousin, Jennifer, wherein he indicated he was a member of a blood gang. Jones\r\nfurther denied stating in front of Jennifer that if Vincent ever hit Crystal again, he\r\nwas going to shoot Vincent or have someone else shoot him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1It is not clear what was argued during the bench conference or how the trial court\r\nultimately ruled. No further on-record objections were raised to any other\r\nevidence relating to gangs during Jones' testimony.\r\n\nThereafter, the State, without objection, elicited reply testimony from Crystal's\r\ncousin, Jennifer. Jennifer testified that, during the time Crystal was living in\r\nBelton, she heard Jones comment about a gang, stating he was part of \"The\r\nBloods.\" She also heard Jones state he would shoot Vincent if Vincent hurt\r\nCrystal, or he would get someone else to shoot Vincent.\r\n\r\nThe State also called Greenville County Sheriff's Office Gang Investigator\r\nBrandon Brown in reply, over Jones' objection, asserting his testimony was\r\nadmissible as proper rebuttal testimony in a challenge to Jones' credibility. Trial\r\ncounsel objected to Brown being qualified as an expert in gangs arguing \"being an\r\nexpert on gangs has nothing to do with this case.\" The court found Brown\r\nqualified, and Brown thereafter testified concerning his general knowledge about\r\ngangs, as well as his knowledge about \"The Bloods,\" a gang present in the Upstate.\r\nBrown stated that the color associated with \"The Bloods\" is primarily the color red,\r\nwhich is used as a physical identifier of the gang. He also testified how one is\r\ngenerally initiated into a gang —– through a beat in, through a criminal act, or\r\nthrough a bless in —– and how one can exit a gang —– by reaching a high enough\r\nrank after putting in enough work, typically coming around the age of mid 30's to\r\nlate 40's, or possibly through beat ins or criminal acts, which are very rarely seen in\r\nthe area. When asked whether it would be unusual for someone to claim he is no\r\nlonger a member of a gang but still be involved with one, Brown stated, \"I don't\r\nreally know how you can still be involved and not a member anymore. It's kind of\r\none of those things it's a Blood in, Blood out mentality. Once you're in you're\r\ngoing to put in the work until it comes a time where you gained enough rank and\r\nrespect that you don't have to. The guys underneath you are going to put in the\r\nwork for you. But you're never going to become a gang member and then quit\r\nbeing a gang member but still live the gang lifestyle. It simply doesn't exist.\"\r\n\r\nWe agree with the State that the probative value of Investigator Brown's\r\nimpeachment testimony was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair\r\nprejudice, inasmuch as extensive evidence of Jones' gang affiliation had already\r\nbeen admitted without objection.\r\n\r\nIn criminal cases, this court sits to review errors of law only, and is bound by the\r\ntrial court's factual findings unless those findings are clearly erroneous. State v.\r\nBaccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006). \"The admission or exclusion\r\nof evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge, whose decision will not\r\nbe reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\" State v. Black, 400 S.C. 10,\r\n16, 732 S.E.2d 880, 884 (2012). \"An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial\r\n\ncourt's ruling is based on an error of law or, when grounded in factual conclusions,\r\nis without evidentiary support.\" Id. As well, the admission of reply testimony is\r\nwithin the sound discretion of the trial judge. State v. Todd, 290 S.C. 212, 214,\r\n349 S.E.2d 339, 340 (1986). There is no abuse of discretion in the admission of\r\nreply testimony if it \"is arguably contradictory of and in reply to earlier testimony.\"\r\nId.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, all relevant evidence is admissible. Rule 402, SCRE. \"'Relevant\r\nevidence' means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact\r\nthat is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less\r\nprobable than it would be without the evidence.\" Rule 401, SCRE. However,\r\nrelevant evidence may be excluded if the prejudicial effect of its admission\r\nsubstantially outweighs the probative value of the evidence. See Rule 403, SCRE\r\n(\"Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is\r\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. . . .\"). \"Unfair\r\nprejudice means an undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis.\"\r\nState v. Wiles, 383 S.C. 151, 158, 679 S.E.2d 172, 176 (2009).\r\n\r\nAn appellate court reviews Rule 403, SCRE, balancing determinations pursuant to\r\nthe abuse of discretion standard and gives great deference to the trial court's\r\ndecision. State v. Myers, 359 S.C. 40, 48, 596 S.E.2d 488, 492 (2004). \"A trial\r\ncourt has particularly wide discretion in ruling on Rule 403 objections.\" State v.\r\nLee, 399 S.C. 521, 527, 732 S.E.2d 225, 228 (Ct. App. 2012). A trial court's\r\ndetermination in regard to the comparative probative value and prejudicial effect of\r\nevidence should only be reversed in exceptional circumstances. State v. Stephens,\r\n398 S.C. 314, 319, 728 S.E.2d 68, 71 (Ct. App. 2012). Further, \"[a] trial judge's\r\nbalancing decision under Rule 403 should not be reversed simply because an\r\nappellate court believes it would have decided the matter otherwise because of a\r\ndiffering view of the highly subjective factors of the probative value or the\r\nprejudice presented by the evidence.\" Id. at 320, 728 S.E.2d at 71. \"If judicial\r\nself-restraint is ever desirable, it is when a Rule 403 analysis of a trial court is\r\nreviewed by an appellate tribunal.\" Id.\r\n\r\nHere, although Jones contends that gang evidence was irrelevant in this case since\r\nthe crimes for which he was on trial were not gang related, he does not contest the\r\nrelevancy of Investigator Brown's testimony as to his credibility. The testimony of\r\nthe gang expert clearly challenged Jones' testimony that he was no longer a\r\nmember of a gang. Further, as noted, substantial evidence of Jones' affiliation with\r\na gang was admitted into evidence during Jones' testimony prior to any objection\r\n\nby Jones. Additionally, Jones did not object to the testimony from Jennifer\r\nconcerning his purported gang affiliation. Investigator Brown's testimony served\r\nto impeach Jones' testimony that he was no longer affiliated with the gang.\r\nBecause his testimony was relevant for impeachment purposes, and because\r\nextensive evidence of Jones' gang involvement had already been admitted without\r\nobjection, we believe the probative value of Investigator Brown's testimony was\r\nnot substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. We therefore find\r\nno reversible error in the admission of Investigator Brown's testimony in reply.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, GEATHERS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-394","title":"Padgett v.

Phillips and Carmen V.\r\n             Ganjehsani, both of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\r\n             Attorney General Alan McCrory Wilson and Assistant\r\n             Attorney General Christina J. Catoe, both of Columbia,\r\n             for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Appellant Kristopher Berry challenges his conviction for\r\ncriminal solicitation of a minor. Appellant argues the trial court violated Rule 403\r\nof the South Carolina Rules of Evidence by admitting into evidence a photograph\r\n\nshowing Appellant when he was naked because Appellant stipulated to his\r\nownership of the cell phone containing the photograph and Appellant did not send\r\nthe photograph to the minor victim. Appellant also argues the trial court erred in\r\nadmitting evidence of the offenses that led to Appellant's other-than-honorable\r\ndischarge from the military. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nAppellant was the victim's gymnastics coach. In December 2009, Appellant\r\npurchased a prepaid cell phone for the victim so that he and the victim could send\r\nprivate text messages to one another. One month later, victim's father discovered\r\nthe prepaid cell phone; on the prepaid phone, he found inappropriate text messages\r\nof a sexual nature that Appellant had sent to the victim.\r\n\r\nIn September 2010, Appellant was indicted for committing a lewd act upon a\r\nminor under the age of sixteen and criminal solicitation of a minor. At trial, the\r\nvictim testified that Appellant had sent her a text message stating that he wanted to\r\nget her \"out of her panties.\" Additionally, the victim identified several text\r\nmessages from Appellant regarding setting up a time and location for a sexual\r\nencounter. In one text message, Appellant stated, \"I can see us having sex, but the\r\nkiss should be interesting.\" When questioned as to whether anything happened\r\nbetween her and Appellant, the victim admitted that Appellant had \"French-kissed\"\r\nher in the gym's office during a practice session.\r\n\r\nOn direct examination, Appellant admitted to purchasing the prepaid cell phone,\r\ngiving it to the victim, and sending the text messages to the victim. However, he\r\nclaimed that the text messages he had sent to the victim were just jokes. He further\r\ntestified that he never touched the victim inappropriately.\r\n\r\nDuring cross-examination, Appellant repeatedly denied ownership of a cell phone\r\nthat was collected from him after his initial interview with police. When shown\r\nthe cell phone, Appellant responded, \"This does not look like my phone.\"\r\nAppellant also testified, \"I never lie.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing Appellant's testimony, the State sought to admit a photograph of\r\nAppellant recovered from the cell phone in question. The photograph depicted\r\nAppellant, naked but covering his \"private area\" with his hand, holding the cell\r\nphone up in front of himself to take a picture of himself in the mirror. Defense\r\ncounsel objected to the admission of the photograph, arguing that the photograph\r\n\nwas unfairly prejudicial. The trial court found that the photograph was directly\r\nrelevant and probative on the issue of Appellant's credibility.\r\n\r\nFollowing the court's ruling, defense counsel stated that he would stipulate to\r\nAppellant's ownership of the cell phone containing the photograph. In response,\r\nthe State offered to crop the photograph below Appellant's waist so as to reduce the\r\nprejudicial impact. However, the trial court declined the State's offer, reasoning\r\nthat cropping the picture might suggest to the jury that \"some worse activity is\r\noccurring\" in the missing part of the photograph. The trial court admitted the\r\nphotograph over defense counsel's objection. In addition, the trial court instructed\r\nthe jury that the photograph was to be considered for the limited purpose of\r\ndetermining Appellant's credibility as a witness.\r\n\r\nThe jury subsequently found Appellant not guilty of committing a lewd act upon a\r\nminor, but guilty of criminal solicitation of a minor. The trial court sentenced\r\nAppellant to ten years' imprisonment suspended upon the service of five years,\r\nfollowed by five years' probation. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Admission of Naked Photograph\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the trial court abused its discretion in admitting into evidence a\r\nnaked photograph of Appellant with his genitalia covered. Appellant contends the\r\nphotograph was unduly prejudicial and, thus, in violation of Rule 403, SCRE. He\r\nfurther argues the trial court abused its discretion in not allowing the State to crop\r\nthe photograph or defense counsel to stipulate to Appellant's ownership of the cell\r\nphone containing the photograph, despite his prior denials of ownership.\r\n\r\n      A. Probative Value\r\n\r\n\"Photographs calculated to arouse the sympathy or prejudice of the jury should be\r\nexcluded if they are irrelevant or not necessary to substantiate material facts or\r\nconditions.\" State v. Torres, 390 S.C. 618, 623, 703 S.E.2d 226, 228 (2010). Rule\r\n403, SCRE, provides that \"[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its\r\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\" \"To\r\nbe classified as unfairly prejudicial, photographs must have a 'tendency to suggest\r\na decision on an improper basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an emotional\r\n\none.'\" Torres, 390 S.C. at 623, 703 S.E.2d at 228-29 (quoting State v. Franklin,\r\n318 S.C. 47, 55, 456 S.E.2d 357, 361 (1995)).\r\n\r\nThroughout the trial, Appellant openly and adamantly, in the presence of the jury,\r\ndenied that the cell phone containing the photograph in question belonged to him.\r\nIn light of Appellant's testimony, the photograph was probative concerning\r\nAppellant's credibility considering it showed Appellant holding a cell phone\r\nseemingly identical to the cell phone in question, and considering that the cell\r\nphone in question was in evidence for the jury's comparison. Although a SLED\r\nagent testified to finding the photograph in question on the cell phone and\r\ndescribed the image to the jury, his testimony did not include a detailed description\r\nof the phone which would have assisted the jury in determining whether the cell\r\nphone admitted into evidence belonged to Appellant. Cf. State v. Lee, 399 S.C.\r\n521, 529, 732 S.E.2d 225, 229 (Ct. App. 2012) (finding the admission of sexually\r\ngraphic photos had minimal probative value where the witness testified to finding\r\nsexually graphic images on a digital camera and described them in detail).\r\nBecause the photograph demonstrating Appellant's use of the cell phone was\r\narguably the strongest evidence that Appellant was the owner of the cell phone, we\r\nfind the photograph in question had strong probative value. See State v. Collins,\r\n398 S.C. 197, 202, 727 S.E.2d 751, 754 (Ct. App. 2012) (defining probative value\r\nas \"the weight that a piece of relevant evidence will carry in helping the trier of\r\nfact decide the issues\").\r\n\r\n      B. Danger of Unfair Prejudice\r\n\r\n\"The probative value of the photos must be balanced against 'the danger of unfair\r\nprejudice.'\" Collins, 398 S.C. at 207, 727 S.E.2d at 757. \"Photographs pose a\r\ndanger of unfair prejudice when they have 'an undue tendency to suggest a decision\r\non an improper basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.'\" Id.\r\n(quoting State v. Holder, 382 S.C. 278, 290, 676 S.E.2d 690, 697 (2009)). \"Like\r\nprobative value, unfair prejudice should be evaluated in the practical context of the\r\nissues at stake in the trial of the case.\" Id. at 208, 727 S.E.2d at 757; see State v.\r\nWilson, 345 S.C. 1, 7, 545 S.E.2d 827, 830 (2001) (\"The determination of\r\nprejudice must be based on the entire record and the result will generally turn on\r\nthe facts of each case.\").\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the photograph, we find the photograph did not unduly prejudice\r\nthe jury. Although Appellant is naked in the photograph, his genitalia are covered\r\nand he is not shown in a sexually suggestive position. Additionally, the primary\r\n\npurpose of the photograph's admission was not to establish that Appellant had a\r\nsexually deviant disposition or to inflame the emotions of the jury, but to rebut\r\nAppellant's claim that he did not own the cell phone in question. Cf. Lee, 399 S.C.\r\nat 529-30, 732 S.E.2d at 229-30 (finding sexually graphic nude photographs of the\r\nappellant with other adults were unduly prejudicial where photographs showed the\r\nappellant's genitalia \"in full view\" and the primary purpose of the photographs was\r\nto \"raise the emotions of the jury and to establish that [the appellant] had a\r\ngenerally sexually deviant disposition\"). In fact, the jury was aware that the\r\nphotograph was not sent to the victim and was not admissible for the purpose of\r\ndetermining Appellant's guilt. Accordingly, we find the trial court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in admitting the photograph into evidence.\r\n\r\n      C. Denial of Offers to Stipulate and Crop the Photograph\r\n\r\nThe State is entitled to prove its case with evidence of its own choosing and \"is not\r\nobligated to rely upon a defendant's stipulation.\" State v. Johnson, 338 S.C. 114,\r\n122, 525 S.E.2d 519, 523 (2000) (citing 73 Am.Jur.2d Stipulations § 17 (1974)). In\r\nthis instance, the State did not accept defense counsel's offer to stipulate to\r\nAppellant's ownership of the cell phone in question. Rather, the State offered to\r\ncrop the photograph below Appellant's waist. Because the State was not obligated\r\nto accept defense counsel's stipulation, we find the trial court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in declining defense counsel's offer to stipulate. We further find the trial\r\ncourt acted well within its discretion in refusing to crop the photograph and,\r\nthereby, admitting the photograph in full. See Torres, 390 S.C. at 622-23, 703\r\nS.E.2d at 228 (\"The relevance, materiality, and admissibility of photographs are\r\nmatters within the sound discretion of the trial court and a ruling will be disturbed\r\nonly upon a showing of an abuse of discretion.\").\r\n\r\nII. Admission of Military Discharge\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred in finding the acts which led to his other-\r\nthan-honorable discharge from the Marines were admissible to impeach him under\r\nRule 609(a)(2), SCRE, because his discharge did not constitute a conviction.\r\nHe also argues the trial court erred in failing to conduct a Rule 404(b) analysis. We\r\nfind Appellant's arguments are not preserved for appellate review.\r\n\r\n\"It is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must\r\nhave been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate\r\nreview.\" State v. Rogers, 361 S.C. 178, 183, 603 S.E.2d 910, 912 (Ct. App. 2004)\r\n\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \"To preserve an issue for review\r\nthere must be a contemporaneous objection that is ruled upon by the trial court.\"\r\nState v. Johnson, 363 S.C. 53, 58, 609 S.E.2d 520, 523 (2005). \"The objection\r\nshould be addressed to the trial court in a sufficiently specific manner that brings\r\nattention to the exact error.\" Id. \"If a party fails to properly object, the party is\r\nprocedurally barred from raising the issue on appeal.\" Id. at 58-59, 609 S.E.2d at\r\n523.\r\n\r\nAlthough defense counsel requested a hearing to determine the offenses that could\r\nbe used to impeach Appellant, the only issue defense counsel raised during the\r\nhearing was whether or not the offenses were crimes of dishonesty. Defense\r\ncounsel never raised any argument to the trial court regarding whether or not the\r\nmilitary offenses constituted \"convictions\" under Rule 609(a)(2) and never asked\r\nthe trial court to make any rulings pursuant to Rule 404(b). Defense counsel also\r\ndid not object when the State indicated that the offenses were \"military\r\nconvictions.\" Additionally, defense counsel did not object when the trial judge\r\nadmitted the impeachment evidence under Rule 609(a)(2). Accordingly, we find\r\nAppellant's arguments regarding Rule 404(b) and whether Appellant's prior acts\r\nconstituted convictions under Rule 609(a)(2) are not preserved for our review. See\r\nJohnson, 363 S.C. at 58-59, 609 S.E.2d at 523 (finding that defendant failed to\r\npreserve his claim that the trial court erred in applying the moral turpitude standard\r\nin determining the admissibility of his prior convictions for impeachment purposes,\r\nwhere defense counsel did not specifically object to the application of the moral\r\nturpitude standard, but rather objected on the basis that the convictions were too\r\nremote).\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, GEATHERS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-397","title":"State v.

Parks and (2) declaring the\r\njudgment completely satisfied, null and void, and void ab initio. Channel Group's\r\nprimary argument on appeal is that the circuit court erred in declaring the judgment\r\n\ncompletely satisfied, null and void, and void ab initio. Because Channel Group\r\nfailed to file a motion pursuant to Rule 59(e) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil\r\nProcedure after the circuit court sua sponte declared the judgment satisfied, null\r\nand void, and void ab initio, we affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the\r\nfollowing authorities: Ness v.

He appeals, arguing the trial court erred in instructing the jury with\r\n\nregard to the ABWIK charge that an implication of malice may arise from the use\r\nof a deadly weapon.
