Pleasant, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tWaring S. Howe, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In\r\n  this workersâ€™ compensation action, MeadWestvaco appeals from an order of the\r\n  circuit court affirming a finding of the Appellate Panel of the South Carolina\r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (the Commission) that Johnny Mosleyâ€™s hip\r\n  injuries were work-related and rendered him totally disabled.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn December 1, 1998, Johnny Mosley\r\n  suffered an injury while working for Westvaco, now MeadWestvaco.Â  On this date,\r\n  Mosley felt a pulling sensation in his back and down his leg while removing\r\n  railroad spikes.Â  Mosley subsequently claimed the injury was work-related, and\r\n  the claim was litigated.Â Â Â   \r\nThe\r\n  matter was tried before the single commissioner of the Workersâ€™ Compensation\r\n  Commission in August of 2000.Â  In an order filed in December of 2000, the\r\n  single commissioner found Mosleyâ€™s injury â€œwas the unexpected and unlooked for\r\n  result of work activity,â€ and therefore was compensable.Â  The single\r\n  commissioner ordered MeadWestvaco to pay temporary total disability benefits\r\n  and causally related medical care.Â  In April of 2001, the Commission affirmed\r\n  the single commissionerâ€™s findings and also adopted those findings by\r\n  reference.Â  This order was not appealed further.Â   \r\nOn August 16, 2001, Mosley sought the opinion and care of an\r\n  orthopedic surgeon to address his physical ailments.Â  Dr. Howard Brilliant, an\r\n  orthopedic surgeon, ultimately diagnosed Mosley as having osteoarthritis in his\r\n  hips.Â  On May 13, 2003, Mosley underwent hip replacement surgery for his left\r\n  hip, performed by Dr. Brilliant.\r\nOn April 9, 2004 MeadWestvaco filed a form requesting a hearing to\r\n  address several issues regarding its liability for Mosleyâ€™s medical treatment\r\n  and disability.Â  On June 22, 2004, the single commissioner heard evidence\r\n  regarding, among other matters, whether Mosley was permanently and totally\r\n  disabled and whether his hip injuries were causally related to the December 1,\r\n  1998 accident.Â  The single commissioner found: 1) Mosleyâ€™s hip injuries were\r\n  causally related to the December 1, 1998 accident as established by credible\r\n  expert medical testimony and 2) Mosley was permanently and totally disabled due\r\n  to the combination of his back and hip injuries. Â The single commissioner\r\n  ordered MeadWestvaco to pay all lifetime medical expenses related to these\r\n  injuries and permanent and total disability benefits to Mosley.Â Â Â Â   \r\nMeadWestvaco appealed the single commissionerâ€™s findings to the\r\n  Commission.Â  The Commission affirmed the single commissionerâ€™s decision in full\r\n  and adopted the single commissionerâ€™s findings by reference.Â  Thereafter,\r\n  MeadWestvaco appealed to the circuit court, arguing there was not substantial\r\n  evidence to support the Commissionâ€™s findings.Â  The circuit court affirmed the\r\n  Commissionâ€™s decision, and this appeal followed.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  Administrative Procedures Act establishes our standard of review for decisions\r\n  by the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission as the â€œsubstantial\r\n  evidenceâ€ standard.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d\r\n  304, 306 (1981). Â An appellate court may reverse or modify the Commissionâ€™s\r\n  decision if the appellantâ€™s substantial rights have been prejudiced because the\r\n  decision is affected by an error of law or is clearly erroneous in view of the\r\n  reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  Id. at 132-33, 276 S.E.2d at 305; see\r\n    also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5)(d) &amp; (e) (Supp. 2006).Â  â€œSubstantial\r\n  evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor evidence viewed from one side,\r\n  but such evidence, when the whole record is considered, as would allow\r\n  reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the Full Commission reached.â€ Shealy\r\n    v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  \r\n \r\nThe\r\n  Commission is the ultimate fact finder and is not bound by the single\r\n  commissionerâ€™s findings of fact.Â  Ross v. Am. Red Cross,&nbsp;298 S.C.\r\n  490, 492, 381 S.E.2d 728, 730&nbsp;(1989).Â  The final determination of witness\r\n  credibility and the weight to be given to the evidence is reserved to the\r\n  Commission.Â  Id.Â  In an appeal from the Commission, this court may not\r\n  substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of the\r\n  evidence on questions of fact.Â  Frame v. Resort Servs., Inc., 357 S.C.\r\n  520, 527, 593 S.E.2d 491, 495 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Accordingly, our review is\r\n  limited to deciding only whether the Commissionâ€™s decision is unsupported by\r\n  substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law.Â  Rodriguez v.\r\n    Romero,&nbsp;363 S.C. 80, 84, 610 S.E.2d 488, 490&nbsp;(2005).  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Mosleyâ€™s Hip Injuries\r\nInitially, Mosley\r\n  suggests the unappealed order of April 14, 2001 requires MeadWestvaco to pay\r\n  for Mosleyâ€™s hip injuries.Â  We disagree, although we do recognize that\r\n  MeadWestvaco has attempted in this action to relitigate the compensability of\r\n  the underlying 1998 work related accident.  \r\nThe\r\n  April 2001 order determined that Mosley â€œsuffered a compensable injury by\r\n  accident arising out of and in the course of his employment on or around\r\n  December 1, 1998.â€Â  The Commission found Mosley was â€œentitled to medical care\r\n  for his back and lower extremitiesâ€ and ordered MeadWestvaco to provide\r\n  â€œcausally related medical treatment/care.â€Â  MeadWestvaco did not appeal the\r\n  decision further; therefore, it is the law\r\n  of the case and has been decided with absolute finality.Â  See Charleston Lumber Co. v. Miller Housing Corp., 338 S.C. 171,\r\n  175, 525 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2000) (stating an unchallenged or unappealed ruling\r\n  is the law of the case).\r\nThe\r\n  full nature and extent of Mosleyâ€™s injuries, however, had not fully been\r\n  discovered at the time of the Commissionâ€™s April 14, 2001 decision.Â Â  The\r\n  evidence presented to the Commission showed that Mosley suffered from back and\r\n  leg pain.Â Â  Mosleyâ€™s doctors did not diagnose the osteoarthritis in his hips\r\n  until August 2001.Â  The issue of whether these specific hip injuries were\r\n  causally related to the December 1, 1998 accident was not before the\r\n  Commission.Â  Therefore, although the Commissionâ€™s finding that Mosley suffered\r\n  a compensable injury from the December 1, 1998 accident is the law of the case,\r\n  the issue of whether Mosleyâ€™s hip injuries were causally related has not been determined\r\n  with finality.Â  Accordingly, MeadWestvaco properly brought the matter before\r\n  the Commission for determination, and we now turn to MeadWestvacoâ€™s arguments\r\n  on appeal.\r\nMeadWestvaco\r\n  first argues Mosley did not present substantial evidence to support a finding\r\n  that Mosleyâ€™s accident subsequently caused his hip injuries.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n \r\nSpecifically,\r\n  MeadWestvaco argues that the Commission erred in relying on the testimony of\r\n  Dr. Brilliant, who testified Mosleyâ€™s hip injuries were causally related to the\r\n  December 1, 1998 accident.Â  In making this argument, MeadWestvaco asserts Dr.\r\n  Brilliantâ€™s expert opinion was based on nonexistent facts and therefore the\r\n  probative value of his testimony â€œis destroyed.â€Â Â Â   \r\nAs\r\n  MeadWestvaco correctly points out, â€œit is well settled that the probative value\r\n  of expert testimony, based upon hypothetical facts, stands or falls on the\r\n  existence or nonexistence of the facts upon which it is predicated.â€Â  Chapman\r\n    v. Foremost Dairies, Inc.,&nbsp; 249 S.C. 438, 449, 154 S.E.2d 845,\r\n  851&nbsp;(1967).Â  The key issue for determining whether such testimony is\r\n  probative, then, is whether the hypothetical facts relied upon by the expert\r\n  witness are supported by evidence.Â  See id.Â  If the hypothetical\r\n  facts are supported by evidence within the record, the probative value of the\r\n  expertâ€™s testimony is not destroyed.Â  Id.Â Â   \r\nAt\r\n  his deposition, Dr. Brilliant testified made several assumptions in order to\r\n  have an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to how\r\n  osteoarthritis developed in Mosleyâ€™s hips.Â  He explained:\r\n\r\n\tThe assumptions are that Mr. Mosley was indeed hurt at\r\n  work in December and that since that time until I saw him over the three-year\r\n  period that he had back and left leg pain.Â  That the pain wasnâ€™t --did not\r\n  respond to the injections for his back.Â  Then I -- I feel pretty strongly that\r\n  he got hurt at work.Â  \r\n\r\nIn\r\n  arguing Dr. Brilliant based his testimony upon nonexistent facts, MeadWestvaco\r\n  focuses on Dr. Brilliantâ€™s assumption that Mosleyâ€™s pain did not respond to the\r\n  injections, pointing to multiple notations within Mosleyâ€™s medical records\r\n  indicating that his pain improved following the epidural steroid injections. \r\n \r\nWhile\r\n  the notations in the medical records suggest the epidural steroid injections\r\n  had some effect, there is evidence in the record which supports a conclusion\r\n  that Mosleyâ€™s pain did not respond to the injections because they did not\r\n  provide an ultimate solution to Mosleyâ€™s problem.Â  Indeed, Dr. Brilliant\r\n  testified that he believed the December 1, 1998 accident caused Mosleyâ€™s hip\r\n  condition because â€œhe was working until he got hurt on that day and from that\r\n  day on he continued to have problems.â€Â  Dr. Richardson, the physician who\r\n  treated Mosley for his back injuries and administered the majority of the\r\n  injections, testified these injections only temporarily reduced Mosleyâ€™s pain\r\n  so that he would need periodic injections â€œfor the foreseeable future.â€Â  Dr.\r\n  Richardson also testified that aside from these injections, there was nothing\r\n  else that he could do for Mosleyâ€™s pain.Â   \r\nBecause\r\n  there is evidence that supports Dr. Brilliantâ€™s assumption that Mosleyâ€™s back\r\n  and leg pain did not respond to these injections, the probative value of his\r\n  testimony is not â€œdestroyed,â€ as MeadWestvaco argues.Â  The existence of\r\n  evidence supporting a conclusion contrary to the Commissionâ€™s findings does not\r\n  mean the Commissionâ€™s determination is unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  Ellis\r\n    v. Spartan Mills, 276 S.C. 216, 218, 277 S.E.2d 590, 591 (1981).Â  The\r\n  credibility and weight of the doctorâ€™s testimony was, of course, for the\r\n  Commission as the trier of facts.Â  See Chapman, 249 S.C. at 449,\r\n  154 S.E.2d at 851 (citing McCarty v. Kendall Co., 238 S.C. 493, 120\r\n  S.E.2d 860 (1961)).Â  Therefore, the Commission did not err in relying on Dr.\r\n  Brilliantâ€™s testimony that Mosleyâ€™s hip injuries were causally related to the\r\n  December 1, 1998 accident.  \r\nII.Â  Permanent and Total Disability.\r\nMeadWestvaco\r\n  also argues the Commission erred in finding Mosley was permanently and totally\r\n  disabled.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nA\r\n  claimant may establish total disability in one of three ways under S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 42-9-10 (Supp. 2006).Â  See Wigfall v. Tideland Utils., Inc.,\r\n  354 S.C. 100, 105, 580 S.E.2d 100, 102 (2003).&nbsp; First, a claimant may be\r\n  presumptively totally disabled by showing a physical injury enumerated in section\r\n  42-9-10. Id. &nbsp;If the claimantâ€™s injury is one of the enumerated\r\n  injuries, â€œthe claimant need not show a loss of earning capacity.â€ &nbsp;Id.&nbsp; Loss of earning capacity is conclusively presumed in such a situation\r\n  â€œbecause the Legislature has categorized certain types of injuries as per se totally disabling . . . .â€&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; Second, a claimant\r\n  may establish total disability under section 42-9-10 by showing an injury\r\n  diminished earning capacity to such an extent as to entitle the claimant to\r\n  total disability.Â  Id.&nbsp; It follows that in this scenario, a\r\n  claimant bears the burden of proving lost earning capacity to establish total\r\n  disability.Â  Third, a claimant may establish total disability through multiple\r\n  physical injuries. &nbsp;Id. at 106, 580 S.E.2d at 103.&nbsp; Under this\r\n  scenario a claimant who has a scheduled injury under section 42-9-30 must show\r\n  an additional injury. &nbsp;Id.&nbsp;Â Â   \r\nA.Â Â Combination of Injuries\r\nMeadWestvaco\r\n  first argues that Mosley suffered only a single scheduled injury under S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-30 (1985 &amp; Supp. 2006) and is therefore not entitled to\r\n  benefits under section 42-9-10.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs\r\n  discussed in the preceding section, there was substantial evidence to support\r\n  the Commissionâ€™s finding that Mosleyâ€™s hip injuries were causally related to\r\n  the December 1, 1998 accident.Â  In addition to these injuries, Mosleyâ€™s back\r\n  injuries have been established through the prior Commission decision of April 14,\r\n  2001.Â  Accordingly, Mosleyâ€™s situation falls under the third category for\r\n  recovery pursuant to section 42-9-10, i.e., establishing total disability\r\n  through multiple physical injuries.Â  Indeed, the single commissioner found\r\n  Mosley is permanently and totally disabled â€œbecause of the combination of\r\n  injuries to the back and hipsâ€ under section 42-9-10. Â Because there is\r\n  evidence in the record to support the conclusion Mosleyâ€™s hip injuries were\r\n  causally related to the December 1, 1998 accident, the Commissionâ€™s finding\r\n  that Mosley was entitled to recover under section 42-9-10 due to multiple\r\n  injuries is also supported by substantial evidence.Â  Therefore, we may not\r\n  disturb this finding on appeal.Â   \r\nB.Â Â Reasonable\r\n  Efforts to Secure Employment\r\nMeadWestvacoâ€™s\r\n  next argument is that Mosley failed to meet his burden of proving total\r\n  disability because he did not make reasonable efforts to secure employment.Â  We\r\n  note the issue of whether Mosley met his burden under the Act is not preserved\r\n  for our review.Â  In order to be preserved for our review, an issue must be\r\n  raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.Â  In re Michael H., 360 S.C.\r\n  540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729, 732 (2004) (â€œAn issue may not be raised for the first\r\n  time on appeal.Â  In order to preserve an issue for appeal, it must be raised to\r\n  and ruled upon by the trial court.â€); Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship,\r\n  359 S.C. 505, 510-11, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004) (â€œIt is well settled that, but\r\n  for a very few exceptional circumstances, an appellate court cannot address an\r\n  issue unless it was raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.â€).Â  Based on\r\n  the trial record, we find MeadWestvaco failed to raise this issue to either the\r\n  Commission or the circuit court for review, and consequently the issue was\r\n  never ruled upon.Â  This issue is not preserved for our review.Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe judgment of the\r\n  circuit court is  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and\r\n  KITTREDGE and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-074","title":"Klein v.

Klein (Husband)\r\n  argues the family court erred in awarding Sherry G. Klein (Wife) affirmative\r\n  relief and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm.Â Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband\r\n  and Wife were married on June 16, 1972.Â  The parties had one son, Mark T.\r\n  Klein, II, born on August 8, 1975.Â  During the marriage, Husband owned seven\r\n  pieces of real estate encumbered by a single mortgage (the mortgage) with\r\n  Oconee Savings and Loan Association.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  parties separated in November 1988, and shortly thereafter, Husband filed for\r\n  divorce.Â  The parties subsequently reached a separation agreement resolving all\r\n  issues regarding the divorce. Â Â \r\nThe separation\r\n  agreement specifically addressed the disposition of three pieces of Husbandâ€™s\r\n  real property.Â  Under the agreement, Husband agreed to be responsible for the\r\n  mortgage covering the various properties.Â  Husband also agreed to transfer fee\r\n  simple title of the marital home (Lot 8) to Wife when the partiesâ€™ son reached\r\n  the age of eighteen.Â  Wife agreed to waive any right to Husbandâ€™s four-plex\r\n  house (Lot 6).Â  Lastly, Husband agreed to give Wife one-half of â€œthe net\r\n  proceeds after costs of saleâ€ when the remaining property (Lot 9) was sold.Â  \r\n \r\nOn May 22, 1989,\r\n  the parties appeared before the family court, seeking the courtâ€™s approval of\r\n  the partiesâ€™ separation agreement and requesting a ruling regarding separate\r\n  maintenance and support.Â  The family court incorporated the agreement into its\r\n  order after concluding it was fair and reasonable and awarded Wife separate\r\n  maintenance and support pending the final order.Â  On January 12, 1990, the\r\n  family court issued a final decree of divorce.\r\nOn January 4, 1990,\r\n  Husband sold Lot 6 and Lot 9 for $198,000.Â  Husbandâ€™s records indicate the sale\r\n  price of Lot 9 was $73,000, while the price for Lot 6 was $125,000.Â  Prior to\r\n  this sale, Husband had sold other lots encumbered by the mortgage, and the net\r\n  proceeds from these prior sales were applied to the satisfaction of the\r\n  mortgage.Â  At the time of the January sale, the remaining balance on the\r\n  mortgage was $137,702.91.Â  Husbandâ€™s records indicated net proceeds of\r\n  $45,374.55 after paying the balance on the mortgage, real estate commission,\r\n  and taxes on the properties.Â  On January 5, 1990, Husbandâ€™s attorney forwarded\r\n  a check in the amount of $45,374.55 to the trust account of Acker, Acker, Floyd\r\n  &amp; Welmaker to be escrowed pending the distribution of the proceeds between\r\n  Husband and Wife.Â Â   \r\nOn April 7, 2004,\r\n  Wife filed a Rule to Show Cause against Husband, requesting the family court\r\n  find Husband in contempt.Â  Specifically, Wife alleged Husband failed to convey\r\n  fee simple title to Lot 8 in full because he conveyed a one-half interest in\r\n  the property to her and a one-half interest to the partiesâ€™ son.Â  Wife also\r\n  alleged Husband was in contempt because he failed to pay her one-half of the\r\n  net proceeds from the sale of Lot 9.Â  Lastly, Wife sought attorneyâ€™s fees for\r\n  the Rule to Show Cause action.Â Â   \r\nFollowing Husbandâ€™s\r\n  receipt of notice for the Rule to Show Cause, the partiesâ€™ son executed a deed\r\n  conveying his one-half interest in Lot 8 to Wife.Â  Husband also paid Wifeâ€™s\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â   \r\nHowever,\r\n  at the Rule to Show Cause hearing on April 17, 2006, Husband denied that Wife\r\n  was entitled to any of the net proceeds he received from the sale of the two\r\n  lots.Â  Husband argued he applied the entirety of the sales price from the sale\r\n  of Lot 9 to satisfy the mortgage, leaving no proceeds for Wife from the sale.Â \r\n  Husband also claimed the $45,374.55 in proceeds were entirely from the sale of Lot 6.Â  \r\n \r\nIn\r\n  its Rule to Show Cause Order, dated May 8, 2006, the family court held a\r\n  finding of contempt in abeyance because (1) Wife waited a long time to bring\r\n  the action and (2) the determination of the amount due under the final order\r\n  was confusing, such that the parties did not have a clear method for computing\r\n  the net proceeds.Â  The court adopted Wifeâ€™s rationale for distributing the\r\n  $45,374.55 based on Lot 9â€™s ratable share of the sales price and ordered\r\n  Husband to pay Wife $8,229.Â  Additionally, the family court ordered Husband to\r\n  pay Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees in the amount of $573.Â  Husband appeals.Â Â Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  appeals from the family court, this Court may find facts in accordance with its\r\n  own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Nasser-Moghaddassi v.\r\n    Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. 182, 189, 612 S.E.2d 707, 711 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require this Court to\r\n  disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Lacke v. Lacke, 362 S.C. 302,\r\n  307, 608 S.E.2d 147, 149-50 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Nor must we ignore the fact that\r\n  the family court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better\r\n  position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their\r\n  testimony.Â  Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623\r\n  (2003).Â  However, our broad scope of review does not relieve the appellant of\r\n  the burden of convincing this Court that the family court committed error.Â  Nasser-Moghaddassi,\r\n  364 S.C. at 190, 612 S.E.2d at 711.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;Admissibility of Evidence\r\nHusband\r\n  argues the family court erred in admitting a document illustrating Wifeâ€™s\r\n  calculations of the â€œnet proceedsâ€ owed to her under the real estate sale\r\n  because Wife laid no foundation for its admissibility.Â  We disagree.  \r\nThe\r\n  admission or exclusion of evidence at trial is within the sound discretion of\r\n  the court.Â  Grand Strand Constr. Co., Inc. v. Graves, 269 S.C. 594, 595,\r\n  239 S.E.2d 81, 81 (1977).Â  On appeal, the exercise of the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  discretion will not be disturbed unless there is a showing of (1) a clear abuse\r\n  of discretion, (2) the commission of legal error in the exercise of discretion,\r\n  and (3) prejudice to the rights of the appellant.Â  Rutledge v. St. Paul Fire\r\n    &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 286 S.C. 360, 366, 334 S.E.2d 131, 135&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 1985).  \r\nAt\r\n  trial, Husband objected to the admission of Wifeâ€™s document, arguing Wife was\r\n  not aware of its contents.Â  Following the objection, Wife testified the\r\n  document contained her calculations of the amount owed to her based on the\r\n  sales prices of the two properties.Â  The family court overruled Husbandâ€™s\r\n  objection and admitted the document.Â   \r\nRule\r\n  901(a) of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence states: â€œThe requirement of\r\n  authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is\r\n  satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in\r\n  question is what its proponent claims.â€Â  Testimony of a witness\r\n  with knowledge that â€œa matter is what it is claimed to beâ€ is a method of\r\n  authentication conforming to the requirements of Rule 901.Â  Rule 901(b)(1),Â \r\n  SCRE.\r\nWife\r\n  offered the document to demonstrate her calculation of the figure she claimed she\r\n  was owed from the sale of Lot 9.Â  She expressly testified the document\r\n  represented this calculation and the figure she ultimately claimed to be owed. Â Thus,\r\n  Wifeâ€™s testimony provided a proper authentication for the admission of the\r\n  document into evidence.\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  the figures contained in the document had already been properly admitted into\r\n  evidence.Â  The document included the figures from the sale of Lot 9 as\r\n  contained in two previous exhibits, which were already stipulated into evidence\r\n  by the parties.Â  The document also included the figure Wife testified she\r\n  believed to be her share from the sale of Lot 9.Â  In this regard, the document\r\n  is demonstrative evidence offered as an aid to the fact finder.Â  Demonstrative\r\n  evidence explains or summarizes other evidence and testimony.Â  Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 383, 529 S.E.2d 528, 535&nbsp;(2000).Â  Such\r\n  evidence â€œmust rely on other material testimony for relevance.â€Â  Id.Â  Wifeâ€™s document simply illustrates how, from the figures in the two prior\r\n  exhibits, Wife calculated the amount she claimed to be owed.Â  It is of no\r\n  consequence that she did not testify to having first-hand knowledge of the\r\n  figures contained in the two previous exhibits as they were already admitted\r\n  into evidence.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   \r\nAdditionally, the\r\n  admission of improper evidence is harmless when it is merely cumulative to\r\n  other evidence.Â  Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 300, 519 S.E.2d\r\n  583, 600 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Even if we agreed with Husbandâ€™s argument, we must\r\n  not disturb the family courtâ€™s decision to admit Wifeâ€™s document because\r\n  Husband has made no showing that he has suffered prejudice.Â  As noted\r\n  previously, the document contained figures from evidence which had already been\r\n  properly admitted.Â  Therefore, Husband has not suffered prejudice, and the\r\n  family courtâ€™s decision to admit Wifeâ€™s document was not reversible error.Â  \r\n \r\nII.&nbsp;Reopening of Wifeâ€™s Case at\r\n  Trial\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in allowing Wife to reopen\r\n  her case.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nThe decision to reopen the evidence is within the sound discretion\r\n  of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that\r\n  discretion.Â  Brown v. La France Indus., a Div. of Riegel Textile Corp.,&nbsp;\r\n  286 S.C. 319, 324-25, 333 S.E.2d 348, 351&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1985). In South Carolina, it is well established that the decision of the trial court to allow a\r\n  party to reopen his case will not be reversed unless it results in prejudice to\r\n  the opposing party.Â  Id.Â Â  The wide latitude afforded\r\n  to the trial court permits the court to reopen the case and allow the\r\n  introduction of additional evidence even after a motion for a nonsuit is made.Â  Rakestraw v. Allstate Ins. Co., 238 S.C. 217, 222, 119 S.E.2d 746,\r\n  748&nbsp;(1961) (citations omitted).Â   \r\nWe note it is unclear from the record whether Wife had rested her\r\n  case as Husband claims.Â  After Husbandâ€™s attorney cross-examined Wife, the\r\n  family court instructed Wife to step down and asked if Wifeâ€™s attorney had â€œ[a]nything\r\n  else,â€ to which Wifeâ€™s attorney responded, â€œNo, sir.â€Â  The court then asked Husbandâ€™s\r\n  attorney whether he had any additional testimony, and Husbandâ€™s attorney\r\n  stated, â€œIf [Wife] rests, I have a motion.â€Â  Wifeâ€™s attorney in kind responded,\r\n  â€œIâ€™ll call [Husband].â€Â  It is plausible that Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s response of â€œNo,\r\n  sirâ€ to the family courtâ€™s initial question meant Wifeâ€™s attorney had no\r\n  additional questions for Wife and that only after calling Husband to the stand\r\n  would Wife rest her case.Â   \r\nRegardless, under this Stateâ€™s case law, the family court could\r\n  have subsequently allowed additional evidence even if the Wife had rested her\r\n  case and Husband had made his directed verdict motion.Â  See id.Â  Further,\r\n  Husband does not argue he suffered prejudice by the family courtâ€™s decision.Â \r\n  Absent a showing of prejudice, we cannot disturb the decision of the family\r\n  court.Â Â  Brown, 286 S.C. at 324-25, 333 S.E.2d at 351.&nbsp;\r\nIII.&nbsp;Affirmative Relief\r\nHusband\r\n  argues the family court erred in awarding Wife affirmative relief.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â   \r\nA.&nbsp;Contempt\r\nHusband\r\n  contends because the family court did not find him in contempt, it erred in\r\n  awarding Wife affirmative relief.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nâ€œIt\r\n  is well settled that contempt results from willful disobedience of a court\r\n  order; and before a person may be held in contempt, the record must be clear\r\n  and specific as to acts or conduct upon which the contempt is based.â€ Cheap-Oâ€™s\r\n    Truck Stop, Inc., 350 S.C. 596, 612, 567 S.E.2d 514, 522 (Ct. App. 2002)\r\n  (quoting State v. Bevilacqua,\r\n  316 S.C. 122, 129, 447 S.E.2d 213, 217 (Ct. App. 1994)). A willful act is â€œone\r\n  done voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent to do something the\r\n  law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law\r\n  requires to be done; that is to say with bad purpose either to disobey or\r\n  disregard the law.â€Â  Id. (citations omitted).\r\nThe\r\n  family court held the issue of contempt in abeyance in part because Wife waited\r\n  an extended period of time to bring the Rule to Show Cause action.Â  We agree\r\n  with the family court when it also stated, â€œ[T]he determination in the amount due\r\n  was confusing and the prior [o]rder did not help the parties in providing a\r\n  clear cut methodology from which the amount was to be derive[d].â€Â  Because the\r\n  prior final order did not specify what constituted net proceeds and how those\r\n  proceeds were to be deduced, the family court felt it was unclear as to whether\r\n  Husband willfully disobeyed the final order.Â  However, based on our own view of\r\n  the preponderance of the evidence, we find the ambiguity in the final order\r\n  prevents a finding of contempt against Husband.Â  The facts and circumstances of\r\n  this case do not support a finding of contempt.Â  See Smith v. Smith,\r\n  359 S.C. 393, 397, 597, S.E.2d 188, 189 (Ct. App. 2004) (finding provision in\r\n  settlement agreement was ambiguous such that family court was proper to not\r\n  hold the husband in contempt).Â   \r\nDespite\r\n  this, we agree with the family court when it stated, â€œ[A] common sense and\r\n  reasonable interpretation of [the] order was to give some value out of the sale\r\n  of Lot 9 to [Wife].â€Â  As stated in further detail below, because of the\r\n  ambiguity in the final order, it was proper to award affirmative relief to\r\n  Wife, despite the family courtâ€™s failure to find Husband in contempt.Â \r\n  Therefore, Husbandâ€™s argument is without merit.Â   \r\nB.&nbsp;Interpretation of the Final\r\n  Order and Separation Agreement\r\nHusband\r\n  also contends the family court erred in its interpretation of the prior final\r\n  order and in granting Wife $8,229 in affirmative relief because it failed to\r\n  find an ambiguity in the prior order.Â  Specifically, Husband contends the\r\n  family court erred by inserting essential terms into the partiesâ€™ agreement and\r\n  prorating the mortgage between Lot 6 and Lot 9.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn South Carolina, the construction of a separation agreement is a matter of contract law.Â  Estate\r\n  of Revis by Revis v. Revis, 326 S.C. 470, 477, 484 S.E.2d 112, 116 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1997).Â  â€œIn the enforcement of an agreement, the court does not have the\r\n  authority to modify terms that are clear and unambiguous on their face.â€Â  Messer\r\n    v. Messer, 359 S.C. 614, 621, 598 S.E.2d 310, 314 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œWhere\r\n  an agreement is clear and capable of legal construction the courtâ€™s only\r\n  function is to interpret its lawful meaning and the intention of the parties as\r\n  found within the agreement and give effect to them.â€Â  Bogan v. Bogan,\r\n  298 S.C. 139, 142, 378 S.E.2d 606, 608 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  â€œTo discover the\r\n  intention of a contract, the court must first look to its language - if the\r\n  language is perfectly plain and capable of legal construction, it alone\r\n  determines the documentâ€™s force and effect.â€Â  Davis v. Davis,&nbsp;\r\n  372 S.C. 64, 75, 641 S.E.2d 446, 452&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).Â Â   \r\nOn\r\n  the other hand, â€œ[a]n ambiguous contract is one capable of being understood in\r\n  more ways than one, an agreement obscure in meaning through indefiniteness of\r\n  expression, or having a double meaning.â€Â  Estate of Revis, 326 S.C. at\r\n  479, 484 S.E.2d at 117.Â  Whether or not an ambiguity exists in an agreement\r\n  must be determined from the language of the instrument. Â Steffenson\r\n    v. Olsen, 360 S.C. 318, 322, 600 S.E.2d 129, 131 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  When an\r\n  agreement is susceptible of more than one interpretation, it is ambiguous and\r\n  the court should seek to determine the intent of the parties.Â  Estate of\r\n    Revis, 326 S.C. at 477-78, 484 S.E.2d at 117.Â  â€œ[W]here an agreement has\r\n  been merged into a courts [sic] decree, the decree, to the extent possible,\r\n  should be construed to effect the intent of both the judge and the parties.â€Â  Messer,\r\n  359 S.C. at 628, 598 S.E.2d at 318.Â  Additionally, â€œ[a] court approved divorce\r\n  settlement must be viewed in accordance with principles of equity and there is\r\n  implied in every such agreement a requirement of reasonableness.â€Â  Ebert v.\r\n    Ebert, 320 S.C. 331, 340, 465 S.E.2d 121, 126 (Ct. App. 1995) (quoting 17A\r\n  Am. Jur. 2d Contracts Â§ 479 (1991)).\r\nWe\r\n  agree with the family courtâ€™s finding that the final order was ambiguous.Â  The\r\n  language of the separation agreement, adopted in the final order and divorce\r\n  decree, is as follows: â€œThe [Husband]\r\n  agrees to be responsible for the outstanding mortgage covering the various properties\r\n  which has an approximate balance at this time of $135,000.00. . . .\r\n  Additionally, the [Husband] will give [Wife] one-half (50%) of the net proceeds\r\n  after costs of sale of the remaining duplex house on Lot 9, Willowood Sub.â€Â  \r\n \r\nWe\r\n  agree with the family court that, looking at the language of the final order,\r\n  it is not clear how the satisfaction of the mortgage is to be apportioned among\r\n  the remaining properties, leaving the order susceptible to more than one\r\n  interpretation.Â  We find the family court was not unreasonable in its\r\n  assessment of the partiesâ€™ intent, in that â€œa common sense and reasonable\r\n  interpretation of [the] [o]rder was to give some value out of the sale of Lot 9 to [Wife].â€Â  For these reasons, we hold that the family court did not err in\r\n  interpreting the final order.  \r\nWe\r\n  also hold the family courtâ€™s grant of affirmative relief was reasonable\r\n  considering the language of the order.Â  The separation agreement, as\r\n  incorporated into the final order, is susceptible to multiple interpretations,\r\n  which may have allowed Wife to claim a greater share of the proceeds from the\r\n  sale of Lot 9.Â  For example, the family court found the intent behind the final\r\n  order was to divide the proceeds â€œafter taking into account payoff of the\r\n  mortgage.â€Â  The language of the final order, however, might suggest that the\r\n  mortgage is not to be considered at all since Husband agreed â€œto be responsible\r\n  for the payment of the outstanding mortgage.â€Â  Nevertheless, Wife only sought\r\n  relief based on a ratable share of the total sale prices of Lot 9 and Lot 6.Â  See Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d\r\n  543, 546 (2000) (holding issues not raised to or ruled upon by the trial court\r\n  may not be considered on appeal).Â  In this regard, the family courtâ€™s adoption\r\n  of Wifeâ€™s rationale was reasonable in light of the language of the agreement,\r\n  and therefore, the family court did not err in granting the relief\r\n  requested.Â Â Â   \r\nIV.&nbsp;Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nHusband\r\n  argues the family court erred in awarding Wife attorneyâ€™s fees because the\r\n  court did not find him in contempt, and therefore, the court had no basis for\r\n  awarding attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen\r\n  a party in an action seeks attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court has the statutory\r\n  authority to award â€œa reasonable sum for the claim if\r\n  it appears well-founded.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(A)(38)\r\n  (Supp.2006).Â  An attorneyâ€™s fees award is within the sound discretion of the\r\n  family court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  Davis, 372 S.C. at 88, 641 S.E.2d at 458.\r\nOur\r\n  review of the record reveals no abuse of discretion.Â  Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n  were incurred as a result of a contempt proceeding involving Husband.Â  Wife\r\n  initiated the action in a good faith belief that Husband was willfully disobeying\r\n  a prior order of the family court.Â  While we find Husband was not technically\r\n  in contempt, Wife incurred attorneyâ€™s fees and costs in an effort to enforce\r\n  compliance with a previous court order.Â  See Christy v. Christy,\r\n  317 S.C. 145, 150-51, 452 S.E.2d 1, 4 (Ct. App. 1994) (holding award of\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees against a husband was proper even though the family court\r\n  failed to find the husband in contempt because the fees were incurred as a\r\n  result of the contempt proceeding and the matter was initiated by the wife to\r\n  force compliance with the courtâ€™s order).Â  Therefore, Wifeâ€™s claim for\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees is well founded, and we find no abuse of discretion in the\r\n  family courtâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the family\r\n  court is  \r\nAFFIRMED.[1]Â   \r\nANDERSON, SHORT,\r\n  and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-075","title":"Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

Harrell,\r\n  of North Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  William Waxenfelter (Waxenfelter) sustained a compensable injury to his spine, legs,\r\n  and right hip while employed at Wal-Mart.Â  Subsequently, Waxenfelter asserted a\r\n  change of condition for the worse pursuant to South Carolina Code section\r\n  42-17-90 (Supp. 2006) and was awarded temporary total disability benefits.Â \r\n  Wal-Mart and American Homes Assurance (collectively Wal-Mart) appeal this\r\n  award, claiming Waxenfelterâ€™s back infection severed the causal connection\r\n  between his initial compensable injury and resulting worsening of condition.Â \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn April 2003, Waxenfelter was employed at Wal-Mart\r\n  as the sporting goods manager.Â  He was injured when he bent over to move a\r\n  dividing bar that separated a display of folding chairs, which caused a severe\r\n  pain in his lower back and resulted in a compensable injury to his spine, legs,\r\n  and right hip. Â His claim was settled pursuant to a Form 16 settlement\r\n  agreement.Â  In July 2004, Waxenfelter filed a Form 50, asserting a change of\r\n  condition for the worse and requesting temporary total disability benefits and\r\n  additional medical treatment.Â  Wal-Mart denied that Waxenfelter had sustained a\r\n  compensable worsening of his condition.Â    \r\nAt\r\n  the Form 50 hearing, Wal-Mart did not present any witnesses.Â  Waxenfelter\r\n  testified on his own behalf.Â  Both sides submitted numerous medical reports,\r\n  including those of orthopedists, Dr. Bauerle and Dr. Wilkins, and Waxenfelter\r\n  also submitted the deposition testimony of orthopedist Dr. Poletti.Â   \r\n \r\nWaxenfelter\r\n  testified that he incurred two previous lower back injuries while employed at\r\n  Wal-Mart, but he was able to return to work without restriction.Â  After the\r\n  April 2003 injury, Waxenfelter was out of work for approximately five weeks but\r\n  returned to full-time employment with weight-lifting restrictions.Â  While his\r\n  back pain in late 2003 was â€œlow level and manageable,â€ by May 2004, his pain\r\n  was â€œexcruciating.â€Â  In early May 2004, Waxenfelter stated he began to\r\n  experience severe spasms in his back.Â  These spasms were â€œso hard that [he]\r\n  went out of bed onto the floor, literally, in one motion.â€Â  From that time\r\n  until the surgery, he testified he experienced the most â€œhorrendous painâ€ he\r\n  had â€œever known in his life,â€ such that â€œif the scale is one to ten [the pain]\r\n  was off the scale.â€Â   \r\nDr.\r\n  Bauerle examined Waxenfelter in April 2003 after his initial injury and noted\r\n  Waxenfelter sustained a â€œWorkerâ€™s Compensation injury with thoracolumbar\r\n  scoliosis and multilevel degenerative disc disease.â€Â  Dr. Bauerle then referred\r\n  Waxenfelter to Dr. Wilkins for non-surgical rehabilitation. Â Dr. Wilkins examined\r\n  Waxenfelter in April 2003 and again in May 2004 when Waxenfelter complained of\r\n  increased lower back pain. Â Based on an MRI scan in May 2004, Dr.\r\n  Wilkins opined that Waxenfelter suffered from a â€œlarge herniationâ€ to his L1-L2\r\n  disc â€œrelated to his previous workmanâ€™s compensation injury.â€Â  Waxenfelter was\r\n  subsequently hospitalized for four days in May 2004 as a result of his severe\r\n  back pain.Â Â   \r\nIn\r\n  June 2004, Dr. Bauerle and Dr. Poletti treated Waxenfelter for an exacerbation\r\n  of his symptoms, but in July 2004, Waxenfelter had to undergo emergency surgery\r\n  due to a large infection at his L1-L2 disc, which caused a complete collapse of\r\n  the disc space. Â Prior to performing the emergency surgery, Dr. Poletti noted\r\n  Waxenfelterâ€™s MRI indicated â€œa very significant disc herniation at L1-L2 which\r\n  is [a] new onset compared to the previous [injury].â€Â  He further stated,\r\n  â€œ[Waxenfelter] is even worsening subjectively.â€ Â One month later, Dr. Poletti\r\n  stated, â€œMr. Waxenfelter is going to be totally disabled.Â  He is not going to\r\n  be capable of returning to work in the future.â€Â Â   \r\nDr.\r\n  Poletti stated in his deposition, â€œ[Waxenfelterâ€™s disc] was originally\r\n  herniated back in . . . 2003.Â  It had probably been herniated for a long time\r\n  and then got worse.â€ Â While Dr. Poletti noted he removed an epidural abscess in\r\n  July 2004, he also stated, â€œI canâ€™t say for certain that this was an epidural\r\n  abscess the whole time.Â  And it theoretically could have been a disc herniation\r\n  that became superinfected with an abscess.â€Â  In attempting to pinpoint the\r\n  origin of the back infection, which precipitated the surgery, Dr. Poletti\r\n  alternatively opined, â€œ[T]he whole scenario is just as plausible that he\r\n  ruptured this disc and, in the process of getting treated with it, infection\r\n  was seeded and it developed into an abscess.â€\r\nWhen\r\n  questioned about whether Waxenfelterâ€™s spine condition had worsened since Dr.\r\n  Poletti first examined Waxenfelter in 2003, Dr. Poletti responded, â€œYes. No\r\n  question.â€ Â However, Dr. Poletti felt that he could not say with a\r\n  reasonable degree of medical certainty whether a causal relationship existed\r\n  between the infection causing the July 2004 surgery and the pre-existing work\r\n  injuries.Â  Since that time, Waxenfelter has undergone pain management treatment\r\n  and epidural steroid injections.Â   \r\nBased\r\n  on this evidence, the Single Commissioner found Waxenfelter sustained a\r\n  compensable change of condition for the worse and awarded him additional\r\n  medical treatment and temporary total disability benefits from May 8, 2004, the\r\n  last day he was able to work, until the benefits could be properly terminated.[1]Â \r\n  Wal-Mart appealed, and the Appellate Panel affirmed the Single Commissioner.Â \r\n  Wal-Mart appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed the Appellate Panel.Â \r\n  Wal-Mart now appeals to this Court.\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  Administrative Procedures Act applies to appeals from decisions of the Workersâ€™\r\n  Compensation Commission (the Commission).Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C.\r\n  130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  In an appeal from the Commission,\r\n  neither this Court nor the circuit court may substitute its judgment for that\r\n  of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but it\r\n  may reverse when the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Corbin v.\r\n    Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 617, 571 S.E.2d 92, 95 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\n \r\nâ€œAny\r\n  review of the [C]ommissionâ€™s factual findings is governed by the substantial\r\n  evidence standard.â€Â  Lockridge v. Santens of Am., Inc., 344 S.C. 511,\r\n  515, 544 S.E.2d 842, 844 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œSubstantial evidenceâ€ is not a mere\r\n  scintilla of evidence nor evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case,\r\n  but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow\r\n  reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the Commission reached or must\r\n  have reached in order to justify its action. Â Palmetto Alliance, Inc. v.\r\n    S.C. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 282 S.C. 430, 432, 319 S.E.2d 695, 696 (1984). Â \r\nâ€œThe\r\n  possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not\r\n  prevent an administrative agencyâ€™s finding from being supported by substantial\r\n  evidence.â€Â  Lee v. Harborside CafÃ©, 350 S.C. 74, 78, 564 S.E.2d 354, 356\r\n  (Ct. App. 2002) (internal quotations and citations omitted).Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  limit review to deciding whether the Commissionâ€™s decision is unsupported by\r\n  substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law.Â  Corbin, 351\r\n  S.C. at 617, 571 S.E.2d at 95.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWal-Mart contends Waxenfelterâ€™s spinal infection severed the causal connection between his\r\n  initial compensable injury and his resulting worsening of condition.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nGenerally, an\r\n  appeal of a workersâ€™ compensation order is concerned with the conditions prior\r\n  to and at the time of the original award of the Commission. Â Causby v. Rock Hill Printing &amp; Finishing Co., 249 S.C. 225, 228, 153 S.E.2d 697, 698-99\r\n  (1967).Â  Review for a change of condition is concerned with conditions that\r\n  have arisen after the compensable injury. Â Id.Â  When an employee shows a\r\n  change of condition, â€œ[T]he Commission may review an award and on that review\r\n  may make an award ending, diminishing, or increasing the compensation\r\n  previously awarded . . . .â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-17-90 (Supp. 2006).  \r\nA change\r\n  of condition occurs when the employee experiences a change of physical condition\r\n  as a result of his original injury, occurring after the first award. Â Causby,\r\n  249 S.C. at 227, 153 S.E.2d at 698. Â To justify a modification of an award\r\n  based on a change of condition, the employee must show the change of condition\r\n  and its causal connection to the original compensable accident. Â Krell v. S.C. State Highway Depâ€™t, 237 S.C. 584, 588, 118 S.E.2d 322, 323 (1961).Â  Every natural\r\n  consequence which flows from the initial injury, unless the result of an\r\n  independent intervening cause sufficient to sever the chain of causation, is\r\n  also compensable.Â  Whitfield v. Daniel Constr. Co., 226 S.C. 37, 40-41,\r\n  83 S.E.2d 460, 462 (1954).Â  Further, â€œ[c]ircumstantial evidence . . . need not\r\n  reach such a degree of certainty as to exclude every reasonable or possible\r\n  conclusion other than that reached.â€Â  Id. at 43, 83 S.E.2d at 463-64 (internal\r\n  quotation and citation omitted).\r\nBoth sides concede Waxenfelter sustained a change of condition for the worse under section\r\n  42-17-90.Â  Consequently, the issue before this Court is whether the spinal\r\n  infection severed the causal relationship between the initial injury and\r\n  subsequent injury to a degree that would preclude Waxenfelter from receiving\r\n  benefits.Â  We find substantial evidence exists to support the Commissionâ€™s award. \r\n \r\nWaxenfelter\r\n  testified that his back injury had gradually worsened from the initial injury\r\n  in April 2003.Â  His pain was â€œlow level and manageableâ€ in late 2003, but it\r\n  was â€œoff the scaleâ€ by May 2004.Â  Further, the medical evidence presented by\r\n  Waxenfelter, as well as the deposition testimony of Dr. Poletti, reinforces\r\n  that his worsening of condition was a natural progression from his initial\r\n  compensable injury. Â Dr. Poletti testified that regardless of Waxenfelterâ€™s\r\n  spinal infection, he was certain his condition had worsened since 2003.Â  Dr.\r\n  Poletti also testified the abscess plausibly was a result of the work-related\r\n  hernia, which progressively worsened over time into the abscess, or the abscess\r\n  developed as a result of Waxenfelterâ€™s medical treatment for the hernia.Â \r\n  Additionally, Dr. Wilkins opined in May 2004 that Waxenfelterâ€™s disc herniation\r\n  was related to his previous work-related injury.Â  Consequently, Waxenfelter\r\n  presented substantial evidence that his worsening of condition was causally\r\n  related to his initial injury and was not severed by his ensuing back\r\n  infection.Â  In viewing the record as a whole, we find the Commissionâ€™s award is\r\n  justified.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s ruling is Â \r\nAFFIRMED.[2]\r\nANDERSON\r\n  and WILLIAMS, JJ., and CURETON, AJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The Single Commissioner did not hold Wal-Mart\r\n  responsible for treatment costs related to Waxenfelterâ€™s emergency surgery in\r\n  July 2004, and Waxenfelter did not appeal this ruling.Â   \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral arguments pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-076","title":"Richardson v.

Cromartie, II, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In\r\n  this workersâ€™ compensation action, Lee County School District (School District) appeals the award of benefits to Dr. Wallace Richardson, contending (1)\r\n  the work-related accident on which Richardsonâ€™s claim was based did not result\r\n  in any permanent injury; (2) Richardson was not permanently and totally\r\n  disabled; and (3) Richardsonâ€™s unjustified refusal to undergo surgery made him\r\n  ineligible for benefits.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\n \r\nFACTS\r\nRichardson had taught school for thirty years.Â  At the time of his accident, he was a\r\n  science teacher with School District at Lee County Middle School. Â On October\r\n  16, 2002, while Richardson was attending a school staff conference, the wicker\r\n  chair in which he was sitting collapsed, causing him to fall backwards onto his\r\n  back and hips and hit his shoulder.Â  As a result of the accident, Richardson sustained substantial injuries to his back and hips, as well as injuries to his\r\n  head, shoulders, elbows, wrists, and neck.Â   \r\nBefore the\r\n  incident, Richardson suffered from degenerative joint disease and arthritis for\r\n  which he sought treatment from Dr. Williams, his regular physician.Â  Just two\r\n  days before the accident, Richardson, on a referral from Dr. Williams,\r\n  consulted Dr. Ervin, an orthopedic physician in Florence, who determined Richardson was suffering from severe degenerative disease of both hips and advised Richardson he would eventually have to undergo replacement of both hips.Â  Richardson was also an overweight smoker and suffered from chronic bronchitis and sleep\r\n  apnea.Â   \r\nAfter the accident, Dr. Williams treated Richardsonâ€™s leg and hip\r\n  pain.Â  On November 4, 2002, Richardson consulted Dr. Ervin, who wrote in his\r\n  notes that he anticipated Richardson would suffer no permanent impairment from\r\n  his fall and recommended that Richardson follow through with the physical\r\n  therapy prescribed by Dr.Williams.Â  On Dr. Williamsâ€™s advice, Richardson\r\n  underwent physical therapy at Tuomey Rehabilitation Center in Sumter.Â  After three weeks, however, Richardson found no\r\n  improvement in his condition and stopped treatment.Â   \r\nRichardson notified School District and timely filed a workersâ€™ compensation claim.Â  On\r\n  December 20, 2004, the single commissioner held a hearing and found Richardson suffered a compensable injury by accident arising out of and in the course of\r\n  his employment that left him permanently and totally disabled from a\r\n  combination of injuries to his back, legs, and hips.Â  School District, along\r\n  with its insurance company, applied to the appellate panel for review of the single\r\n  commissionerâ€™s findings.Â  The appellate panel unanimously affirmed the order of\r\n  the single commissioner.Â  Thereafter, the circuit court affirmed the appellate panelâ€™s\r\n  order and denied School Districtâ€™s motion to alter or amend. Â This appeal\r\n  followed.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions\r\n  by the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.â€ Â Forrest v.

Â â€œUnder the substantial evidence standard, the appellate court\r\n  may not substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of\r\n  the evidence on questions of fact.â€ Â Forrest, 373 S.C. at 306, 644\r\n  S.E.2d at 785 (citing S.C.

Â â€œSubstantial\r\n  evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor evidence viewed from one side,\r\n  but such evidence, when the whole record is considered, as would allow reasonable\r\n  minds to reach the conclusion the Full Commission reached.â€ Â Shealy, 341\r\n  S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  School District first\r\n  contends Richardsonâ€™s condition existed before his accident and he therefore was\r\n  not entitled to workersâ€™ compensation benefits. Â We disagree.Â   \r\nThe aggravation\r\n  of a pre-existing condition that leads to disability or death is compensable\r\n  under the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  See Glover v.\r\n    Columbia Hosp. of Richland County, 236 S.C. 410, 419, 114 S.E.2d 565, 569\r\n  (1960) (stating a claimantâ€™s pre-existing disease or infirmity does not\r\n  disqualify a workersâ€™ compensation claim if the claimantâ€™s work aggravated,\r\n  accelerated, or combined with the disease or infirmity to cause the condition\r\n  for which compensation is sought); Holly v. Spartan Grain Mill &amp; Co.,\r\n  210 S.C. 183, 189, 42 S.E.2d 59, 62 (1947) (â€œWhere a previously diseased\r\n  condition is aggravated by injury or accident arising out of or in the course\r\n  of employment, and this results in . . . disability, there is a compensable\r\n  injury.â€); Anderson v. Baptist Med. Ctr., 343 S.C. 487, 493, 541 S.E.2d\r\n  526, 528 (2001) (â€œThe right of a claimant to compensation for aggravation of a\r\n  pre-existing condition arises only where there is a dormant condition which has\r\n  produced no disability but which becomes disabling by reason of the aggravating\r\n  injury.â€); Mullinax v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., 318 S.C. 431, 437, 458\r\n  S.E.2d 76, 79 (Ct. App. 1995) (â€œ[A] work-related accident which aggravates or\r\n  accelerates a pre-existing condition, infirmity, or disease is . . .\r\n  compensable.â€).\r\nSchool\r\n  District asserts Richardsonâ€™s hip problems were caused by years of obesity and\r\n  the stress of being a professional football player.Â  Although Richardson\r\n  himself acknowledged he had been a large man his whole life and played both\r\n  college and professional football, we cannot, under our standard of review,\r\n  disregard the substantial evidence of record that Richardsonâ€™s present\r\n  complaints resulted from his workplace accident rather than his prior physical\r\n  condition.Â  This evidence consists of both lay and professional testimony.\r\nAt\r\n  the hearing before the single commissioner, Richardson testified about\r\n  differences in his physical abilities before and after his accident.Â  He stated\r\n  that, although he did not need a cane before his accident, he now cannot walk\r\n  or stand up from a sitting position without one.Â  Before his injury, in\r\n  addition to working full time with School District, he was a pastor to three\r\n  church congregations, but can no longer continue any of these activities.Â  Since\r\n  the accident, he has been unable to help his wife with cleaning, shopping, and\r\n  other household activities.Â  Furthermore, Richardson testified he experienced a\r\n  weaker physical state even with his medication use.Â  In addition, Richardsonâ€™s wife testified on his behalf and supported his assertions.Â  \r\n \r\nThe\r\n  record also has medical evidence that Richardsonâ€™s accident resulted in a\r\n  compensable injury.Â  Although Dr. Ervin initially anticipated no permanent\r\n  impairment as a result of the incident, he later stated he did not feel Richardson would be able to continue with his job as a school teacher and assigned him a\r\n  forty-percent impairment rating for each hip.Â  Significantly, in his\r\n  deposition, Dr. Ervin, in responding to a question from Richardsonâ€™s attorney\r\n  regarding his opinion as to whether Richardsonâ€™s fall aggravated his\r\n  pre-existing degenerative disease, stated â€œthereâ€™s no question about it.â€Â  \r\n \r\n2.Â  School District next\r\n  argues Richardson failed to meet his burden of proving a loss of earning\r\n  capacity under the workersâ€™ compensation statutes.Â  In support of this\r\n  argument, School District contends Richardson is qualified and capable of\r\n  retaining a high earning capacity in an administrative position despite his\r\n  accident.Â  We decline to address this argument.\r\nWe\r\n  have reviewed the record on appeal and found no indication that School District either raised this issue to the appellate panel or presented it in its\r\n  petition for judicial review; therefore, this issue is not preserved for our\r\n  review. Â Although this issue may have been referenced in School Districtâ€™s\r\n  motion under Rule 59(e), the motion cannot cure the failure to timely raise it\r\n  to the appropriate tribunal. Â See Hickman v. Hickman, 301 S.C.\r\n  455, 456, 392 S.E.2d 481, 482 (Ct. App. 1990) (â€œA party cannot use Rule 59(e)\r\n  to present to the court an issue the party could have raised prior to judgment\r\n  but did not.â€).\r\n3.Â  Finally, School District\r\n  argues that, pursuant to South Carolina Code section 42-15-60, Richardson should have been ordered to forfeit his benefits because he refused reasonable\r\n  medical treatment.Â  In support of this argument, School District appears to assert\r\n  that Richardson, in refusing to lose weight and continuing to smoke, has\r\n  without good cause made himself unable to undergo recommended hip replacement\r\n  surgery to improve his condition.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nSection\r\n  42-15-60 provides in pertinent part as follows:  \r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  refusal of an employee to accept any medical, hospital, surgical or other\r\n  treatment when provided by the employer or ordered by the Commission shall bar such employee from further compensation until such refusal ceases and\r\n  no compensation shall at any time be paid for the period of suspension unless\r\n  in the opinion of the Commission the circumstances justified the refusal, in\r\n  which case the Commission may order a change in the medical or hospital service.\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-60 (1985) (emphasis added).\r\nIn finding\r\n  Richardson was justified in â€œrefusingâ€ bilateral hip arthroplasty surgery, the\r\n  single commissioner, affirmed by the appellate panel and the circuit court, cited\r\n  not only the risks of the surgery but also the absence of any request by School\r\n  District that Richardson undergo such an operation.Â  School District does not\r\n  allege it ever offered, much less provided, such a procedure.Â  Under these\r\n  circumstances, we hold section 42-15-60 does not apply to the present case.Â  Regardless\r\n  of whether Richardsonâ€™s failure to lose weight and stop smoking could constitute\r\n  an unjustified refusal of recommended treatment, the fact that this treatment\r\n  was neither provided by School District nor ordered by the Workersâ€™\r\n  Compensation Commission prevents this failure from making him ineligible for\r\n  benefits.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J.,\r\n  KITTREDGE and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-077","title":"State v.

Cleary, of Columbia and Ernest\r\n  Charles Grose, Jr., of Greenwood, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney\r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant\r\n  Attorney General Shawn L. Reeves, all of Columbia; Â and Solicitor Jerry W. Peace,\r\n  of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In\r\n  July 2005, Robert Orlando Hill (Hill) was convicted of voluntary manslaughter\r\n  and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime. He was\r\n  sentenced to a total of thirty-five years in prison. Â Hill appeals this\r\n  conviction contending the trial court erred by refusing to admit testimony\r\n  regarding prior threats in connection with the deceased victim.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS  \r\nAppellant\r\n  Hill was charged with shooting Artell Hill[2] (Artie) while Artie sat in the\r\n  passenger seat of a parked car. Â The shooting occurred shortly after Odell Tillman, Jeffrey Tatum, and Artie rode in Tillmanâ€™s\r\n  car to Eastgate Apartments in Calhoun Falls. Â Tillman parked the car and\r\n  entered an apartment while Tatum exited the rear of the car and stood next to\r\n  the passenger side window to talk to Artie.Â  Shortly thereafter, Hill rode into\r\n  the Eastgate Apartmentsâ€™ parking lot on a bike. \r\nAt trial the State presented testimony from five witnesses who\r\n  were present at the shooting.[3]Â \r\n  Hill and three of the Stateâ€™s witnesses testified Tatum said, â€œWhatâ€™s up?â€ to\r\n  Hill as he rode into the parking lot. Â Hill responded, â€œNothing,â€ at which\r\n  point Artie said â€œ I heard you been looking for me,â€ to Hill. Â Two witnesses\r\n  testified Hill responded, â€œStay right there,â€ as he disembarked from the bike,\r\n  walked towards the parked car, pulled his shirt up, removed a gun from his\r\n  pants, and shot Artie six times. \r\nHill testified he began shooting when he saw Artie reach over as\r\n  though he were going to open the car door. Â None of the Stateâ€™s five witnesses\r\n  saw Artie move towards the car door or attempt to open the car door. Â Hill\r\n  also testified Artie had raised a stick-like bat towards him. Â After the\r\n  shooting Artie was found clasping a stick-like bat, however, witnesses never saw\r\n  the stick until after Artie had been shot. \r\nHill shot Artie six times, including four shots to the head. Â After\r\n  the shooting, Hill got back onto his bike and rode away. Â He turned himself\r\n  into the police the following morning. Hill was indicted for murder and\r\n  possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime. Â During\r\n  his July 2005[4] trial, Hill admitted to shooting Artie but claimed he did so in self-defense as\r\n  he felt he was in danger. Â A jury found Hill guilty of voluntary manslaughter\r\n  and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime. Â Hill appeals. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State\r\n    v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220&nbsp;(2006).Â  An appellate\r\n  court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly\r\n  erroneous.Â  Id.Â  This same standard of review applies to a trial courtâ€™s\r\n  determination of the admissibility of certain evidence in criminal cases.Â  State\r\n    v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  â€œThe admission or\r\n  exclusion of evidence is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the\r\n  trial court and its ruling will not be disturbed in the absence of a manifest\r\n  abuse of discretion accompanied by probable prejudice.â€ State v. Wise,\r\n  359 S.C. 14, 21, 596 S.E.2d 475, 478 (2004).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Shannon\r\n  Hillâ€™s Testimony\r\nAt trial Hill unsucessfully sought to introduce testimony from\r\n  Shannon Hill[5] (Shannon) that she had heard of Artie chasing her brother with a stick-like\r\n  bat. Â Since Shannon had no\r\n  first hand knowledge of the incident, the trial court sustained a hearsay\r\n  objection. Â Hill then proffered Shannonâ€™s testimony from his first trial in\r\n  which Shannon testified she heard Artie had chased her brother with a bat but\r\n  denied that Artie frequently carried bats. Â Hill argues Shannonâ€™s testimony\r\n  regarding this incident should have been admitted into evidence as he could have\r\n  taken it into account when he decided to defend himself by shooting Artie.Â  We\r\n  disagree. \r\nâ€œIn the murder prosecution of one pleading self-defense against an\r\n  attack by the deceased, evidence of other specific instances of violence on the\r\n  part of the deceased are not admissible unless they were directed against the\r\n  defendant or, if directed against others, were so closely connected at point of\r\n  time or occasion with the homicide as reasonably to indicate the state of mind\r\n  of the deceased at the time of the homicide, or to produce reasonable apprehension of great bodily harm.â€ State\r\n    v. Day, 341 S.C. 410, 419-420, 535 S.E.2d 431, 436 (2000).Â  Whether a\r\n  specific instance of conduct by the deceased is so closely connected in time as\r\n  to be admissible is in the trial court's discretion and will not be disturbed\r\n  on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Id. at 420, 535 S.E.2d at 436.\r\nIn this instance, Artie was allegedly violent toward Shannonâ€™s brother, not Hill.Â  The record fails to state when the incident took place or how\r\n  it was closely connected with the shooting.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial\r\n  court did not err in refusing to admit testimony from Shannon regarding an\r\n  incident between her brother and Artie.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Appellant\r\n  Hillâ€™s Testimony\r\nThe trial court refused to allow Hill to testify that Artieâ€™s\r\n  friend, Sammy, had sent word through Artieâ€™s girlfriend, Glenrissa, that when\r\n  Sammy saw Hill, Sammy â€œwas going to handle the business.â€ Â Hill argues this\r\n  testimony should have been admitted to illustrate he believed Artie had\r\n  threatened him and show Hillâ€™s state of mind when he shot Artie.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt trial Hill testified to prior threats from Artie. Â Hill also\r\n  recounted an incident in which a bunch of their peers were chasing each other\r\n  with stick-like bats and Artie hit the car Hill was in, denting it twice. Â Hill\r\n  further testified that Artie and Sammy conveyed threats to him through other\r\n  people which caused Hill to avoid being in close proximity with Artie. Â After\r\n  the trial court would not allow further testimony regarding instances in which\r\n  Hill learned of threats through a third person, Hill proffered the following\r\n  testimony:\r\n\r\n\tQ: When you were testifying in front of the jury, I asked you\r\n  about having received threats through other people, right?\r\n\tA: Yes, sir.\r\n\tQ: And you were getting ready to talk about something that Sammy\r\n  had said to you?\r\n\tA: Yes, sir.\r\n\tQ: All right.Â  What was it that Sammy had said to you?\r\n\tA: Sammy had sent word from Glenrissa Gates, Artieâ€™s girlfriend at\r\n  the time, that when he seen me, me and him was going one on one, when he see\r\n  me, he was going to handle the business.\r\n\tQ: Who did you understand was going to handle the business?\r\n\tA: Sammy at the time, that is what he said.\r\n\tQ: About who?\r\n\tA: About me, sent the word, tell me that.\r\n\tQ: Who sent the word?\r\n\tA: Sammy.\r\n\tQ: All right.Â  Was Artie connected with that?\r\n\tA: Yes, sir.\r\n\tQ: How was Artie connected with that?\r\n\tA: Well, Artie and Sammy, they were like best friends.\r\n\tQ: Okay.Â  And who were you worried about handling the business\r\n  with you?\r\n\tA: Well, Artieâ€¦.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-settled rule that in homicide cases, the defendant is\r\n  permitted to introduce testimony concerning previous difficulties with the\r\n  decedent.Â  State v. Atchison, 268 S.C. 588, 593, 235 S.E.2d 294, 296\r\n  (1977).Â  â€œThe rationale for allowing such evidence is that it is relevant to\r\n  the issue of the animus of the parties as it relates to the demeanor each party had reason to expect from the other\r\n  when they met at the time of the fatal difficulty.â€ Id. at 593-94, 235\r\n  S.E.2d at 296.Â  \r\nIn this instance, Hill is attempting to introduce testimony\r\n  concerning a threat from a friend of the decedent, not Artie himself.Â  The admission or exclusion of evidence is within the\r\n  discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 121, 551 S.E.2d 240,\r\n  244&nbsp;(2001).Â  We find no such abuse occurred by refusing to admit Hillâ€™s\r\n  testimony regarding a threat from Sammy delivered via Glenrissa.Â  Although\r\n  Sammy was Artieâ€™s friend, Sammy was not present at or in anyway involved with\r\n  the shooting.Â  In addition, we note the record already contained evidence of Artieâ€™s\r\n  direct threats towards Hill. Â Any error in excluding\r\n  Hillâ€™s testimony regarding Sammyâ€™s threat was harmless and could not have\r\n  reasonably affected the result of the trial since evidence of Artieâ€™s threats was\r\n  already in the record. State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 380-81, 580 S.E.2d\r\n  785, 795 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\nAccordingly, the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, SHORT, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The victim, Artell Hill, is not related to Appellant\r\n  Robert Orlando Hill.  \r\n[3] Although the testimony of the five witnesses varies\r\n  depending on what each heard Hill, Tatum, and Artie say, all agree on the\r\n  pattern of events preceding the shooting.\r\n[4] The trial held in July 2005 was Hillâ€™s second trial.\r\n  Hillâ€™s first conviction was reversed after a successful appeal regarding the\r\n  Stateâ€™s comments on Hillâ€™s post-arrest silence.

Hale, of Hilton Head Island, for Appellant.\r\n        Gregory M. Alford, of Hilton Head Island, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  White Hat appealed Hilton Headâ€™s order to stop construction of residential\r\n  homes on Lot 142 of Sea Pines Plantation to the Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA).Â \r\n  The BZA found Lot 142 was designated as golf course or if undesignated, open\r\n  space, and affirmed the stop work order.Â  The\r\n  circuit court, sitting in its appellate capacity, affirmed.Â  White Hat appeals,\r\n  and we affirm.\r\n1. White\r\n  Hat argues the circuit court erred by deferring to the BZAâ€™s findings as the\r\n  BZA interpreted an ordinance.Â  We disagree and find the BZAâ€™s findings were factual,\r\n  warranting deference from the circuit court and this court. \r\nThe\r\n  factual findings of a BZA will\r\n  not be disturbed, unless there is no evidence to support the findings.Â  Vulcan\r\n    Materials Co. v. Greenville County Bd. of Zoning Appeals, 342\r\n  S.C. 480, 488, 536 S.E.2d 892, 896 (Ct. Ap. 2000).Â  Conversely,\r\n  the BZAâ€™s ruling will not be upheld if an error of law exists or if the BZA\r\n  acted arbitrarily or unreasonably.Â  Peterson Outdoor Adver. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 327 S.C. 230, 235, 489 S.E.2d 630, 633 (1997).Â  Â Â \r\nIn this\r\n  case, the BZA found â€œthis property is a portion of the Golf Course and was\r\n  designated as a golf course use.â€Â  The BZA went on to find if the designation\r\n  was uncertain, then â€œit should be found as undesignated and, therefore, open\r\n  space.â€Â  We hold this determination is factual, supported by some evidence, and\r\n  neither arbitrary nor unreasonable.\r\nThe 1984 Master Plan of Sea Pines is devoid of any reference to Lot 142, the piece of property this case involves.Â  Lot 142 was created after 1984.Â  Lot\r\n  142 appeared in December 1999, when a Settlement Agreement granted Lot 142 by quitclaim deed to Sea Pines\r\n  Land Company, which later became known as White Hat.Â  Also in December 1999,\r\n  Hilton Head issued subdivision approval for Lot 142.Â  However, neither of these\r\n  actions amended the Master Plan, which was necessary to change zoning.\r\nBefore\r\n  the BZA, Hilton Headâ€™s Urban Designer stated Lot 142, under the Land Use Map,\r\n  was part of the golf course, which is nonresidential.Â  The Designer further\r\n  informed the BZA that he determined the property was undesignated.Â  We believe\r\n  there is evidence to support the BZAâ€™s finding.\r\nWhite\r\n  Hat attempts to expand this courtâ€™s scope of review by arguing the BZAâ€™s\r\n  determination was legal, not factual.Â  White Hat points to Hilton Head Land Management Ordinance\r\n  section 16-4-209(D) (1993), which states, â€œUndesignated areas on these master\r\n  plans shall be considered as open space.â€Â  This argument is faulty, as the\r\n  BZAâ€™s finding hinges on its factual determination the land was golf course or\r\n  undesignated, not any perceived application of the ordinance.\r\nThis\r\n  court acknowledges the ostensible unfairness created by the stop work order, but the standard of review restrains this court to defer\r\n  to the BZAâ€™s judgment on factual findings regarding zoning.Â  See Clear\r\n    Channel Outdoor v. City of Myrtle Beach, 372 S.C. 230, 234, 642 S.E.2d 565,\r\n  567&nbsp;(2007) (â€œA court will refrain from substituting its judgment for that\r\n  of the reviewing body, even if it disagrees with the decision.â€).Â  Moreover,\r\n  this seeming inequity may be attributed in part to White Hatâ€™s own conduct.Â  As\r\n  the circuit court noted, White Hatâ€™s losses due to the stop work order flow\r\n  directly from White Hatâ€™s continued representation the 1999 Settlement\r\n  Agreement authorized the building of two houses on Lot 142, which it did not.Â \r\n  As noted above, an amendment to the Master Plan was necessary to affect a\r\n  zoning change.Â  In this regard, White Hatâ€™s proper\r\n  remedy is to apply for a zoning map amendment.Â  See Hilton Head Land Management Ordinance Â§16-3-1608 (1998).\r\n2. White\r\n  Hat additionally contends the BZA denied White Hatâ€™s due process rights to\r\n  develop its case.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder South Carolina jurisprudence, due process\r\n  requires â€œ(1) adequate notice; (2) adequate opportunity for a hearing; (3) the\r\n  right to introduce evidence; and (4) the right to confront and cross-examine\r\n  witnesses.â€Â  Clear Channel, 372 S.C. at 235, 642 S.E.2d at 567.Â  In Clear\r\n    Channel, the South Carolina Supreme Court found the partyâ€™s due process\r\n  rights were not violated because the party had notice of the nonconformity\r\n  issue and an opportunity to be heard.Â  372 S.C. at 235, 642 S.E.2d at 568.\r\nIn the case at\r\n  hand, the stop work order was issued on September 14, 2004.Â  White Hat appealed\r\n  the order to the BZA on September 28, 2004.Â  The BZA conducted two hearings\r\n  regarding the order, both of which White Hatâ€™s counsel attended.Â  At the second\r\n  hearing, White Hatâ€™s counsel made a presentation to the BZA.Â  Therefore, White\r\n  Hat had notice of the issue regarding Lot 142â€™s zoning and an opportunity to be\r\n  heard.Â  Thus, White Hatâ€™s due process rights were not violated.\r\n3. White\r\n  Hat next argues Hilton Head should be estopped from denying Lot 142 is zoned\r\n  residential.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn order to claim equitable estoppel, a party must\r\n  illustrate: â€œ(1) a lack of knowledge and the means of knowledge of truth as to\r\n  facts in question; (2) justifiable reliance upon the conduct of the party\r\n  estopped; and (3) prejudicial change in the position of the party claiming\r\n  estoppel.â€Â  Clear Channel, 372 S.C. at 235, 642 S.E.2d at 568.Â  \r\nIn Clear\r\n  Channel, Clear Channel applied for a permit to replace a billboard, which\r\n  was completely destroyed by a tornado.Â  372 S.C. at 232, 642 S.E.2d at 566.Â \r\n  The Zoning Administrator denied the permit because of a zoning ordinance\r\n  prohibiting the construction of new billboards, and the cityâ€™s BZA upheld the\r\n  denial.Â  Id.Â  Clear Channelâ€™s previous billboard did not conform;\r\n  however, Clear Channel argued the city was estopped from arguing nonconformity\r\n  because the city inspected the previous billboard and found it did conform.Â  Id. at 235, 642 S.E.2d at 568.Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court rejected Clear\r\n  Channelâ€™s argument stating, Clear Channel is â€œin the business of\r\n  outdoor advertising and had ample means of knowing its sign violated the Cityâ€™s ordinance.â€Â  Id. at 235-36, 642 S.E.2d at 568.Â  Further, Clear Channel knew or had means to know\r\n  its sign was nonconforming under the city ordinance.Â  Id. at 236, 642\r\n  S.E.2d at 568.Â  Therefore, Clear Channelâ€™s â€œreliance on the doctrine of\r\n  estoppel is misplaced.â€Â  Id. \r\nThis\r\n  caseâ€™s facts fit squarely with Clear Channel.Â  White Hat had ample means\r\n  of knowing (especially from Hilton Head Land Management Ordinance section\r\n  16-3-1608) the only way to affect zoning was to change the Master Plan through\r\n  a zoning map amendment, despite Hilton Headâ€™s improper issuance of a building\r\n  permit.Â  Accordingly, Hilton Head is not estopped from denying Lot 142 is residential.\r\n4. Finally,\r\n  White Hat asserts Hilton Headâ€™s adoption of the 1993 amendment to section\r\n  16-4-209 of Hilton Head Land Management Ordinance, which made undesignated land\r\n  open space, is void for lack of notice.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn\r\n  1993, the applicable law barred a challenge to an amendment of a zoning\r\n  regulation more than two years after the public hearing for inadequacy of\r\n  notice, if substantial compliance with notice requirements existed.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-7-730 (Supp. 1994).[1]Â \r\n  Section 6-7-730 mandated the governing authority to hold advertised, public\r\n  hearings regarding the amendment.\r\nThe\r\n  record does indicate eight public hearings were conducted and a First and\r\n  Second reading by the town council prior to the adoption of the 1993\r\n  amendment.Â  Additionally, the record includes two newspaper clippings\r\n  advertising the public hearings.Â  Therefore, this argument is without merit\r\n  because it falls after the two-year statue of limitations and the record\r\n  provides evidence of proper notice.Â  \r\nWhite\r\n  Hat heavily relied on Brown v. County of Charleston, 303 S.C. 245, 247,\r\n  399 S.E.2d 784, 785-86 (Ct. App. 1990), where this court held the notice of an\r\n  amendment did not sufficiently notify landowners the use of their own property\r\n  would be altered, even though no one contested the advertisementâ€™s compliance\r\n  with the statutory guidelines.Â  Brown is easily distinguished from the\r\n  case at hand as the amendment in this case did not change a current landownerâ€™s\r\n  property rights.Â  Instead, the ordinance attempted to bring continuity to the\r\n  subdivision by designating uncertain land as open space.Â  Additionally, as in Clear\r\n    Channel, White Hat is in the land development business and should have\r\n  known the potential implications of the amendment.Â  372 S.C. at 236, 642 S.E.2d at 568.\r\nDuring\r\n  oral argument, White Hat asserted an unconstitutional taking occurred; however,\r\n  this issue was not ruled upon below or advanced in White Hatâ€™s brief.[2]Â \r\n  Therefore, under issue preservation principles, this argument is not properly\r\n  before us.Â  See Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505,\r\n  510-11, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715&nbsp;(2004) (â€œIt is well settled that, but for a\r\n  very few exceptional circumstances, an appellate court cannot address an issue\r\n  unless it was raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.â€). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAlthough White Hat attempts to disguise the BZAâ€™s\r\n  factual determinations as legal, our standard of review requires this court to\r\n  defer to the BZAâ€™s factual findings.Â  Further, White Hatâ€™s due process,\r\n  estoppel, and public notice arguments lack merit.Â  Accordingly, the BZAâ€™s order\r\n  is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The\r\n  current law limits the statute of limitations to sixty days after the decision\r\n  of the governing body.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-760(D) (2004).\r\n[2]Â  The last sentence of White Hatâ€™s reply brief referred\r\n  to a â€œconstitutionally inappropriate taking;â€ however, this mere mention of a\r\n  taking is conclusory.Â  See Glasscock, Inc. v. U.S. Fid. and Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d 689, 691&nbsp;(Ct.

Widener, both of Charleston; Michael\r\n  Sher, of Chicago, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Midland\r\n  Parkway Associates, LLP (Midland) brought this action against George Touras, Equity Properties and\r\n  Development Company, Wilmington Trust Company, as Trustee for\r\n  Southland-Summerville W. D. Delaware Business Trust, and Principal Mutual Life\r\n  Insurance Company (collectively Wilmington).Â  Midland sought specific\r\n  performance of an alleged oral agreement to convey real estate between Midland and Wilmington.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Wilmington on Midlandâ€™s causes of action for breach of contract, fraudulent\r\n  misrepresentation, violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act\r\n  (UTPA), and promissory estoppel.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nRobert Irick is\r\n  the managing partner of Midland.[2] Â In July of 1999, Midland purchased a parcel of land located in Summerville, South Carolina (Midland Parcel).Â  Following the closing, Midland constructed an\r\n  apartment complex on the Midland Parcel.\r\nDuring construction,\r\n  Midland discovered a water problem on the Midland Parcel. Â According to Midland, water migrated onto the Midland Parcel from an adjacent property leased by\r\n  Winn-Dixie and owned by Wilmington.Â  The migrating water allegedly caused\r\n  damage to the Midland Parcel including a snake infestation and â€œbubblingâ€ of\r\n  the asphalt parking lot.\r\nOn September 27, 2001, Irick sent a letter\r\n  to Wilmingtonâ€™s counsel, Douglas Lubelchek, proposing: (1) Wilmington deed\r\n  Midland .878 acres of property leased by Winn-Dixie; (2) Midland accept the\r\n  drainage and bear any expense of additional drainage construction; (3) Midland ensure\r\n  zoning would not be adversely affected; and (4) Midland indemnify Wilmington for\r\n  any damage.Â  Midland sent a similar letter to a Winn-Dixie representative, who\r\n  orally agreed to â€œencourage [Wilmington] to cooperate with [Midland].â€Â  Irick and Lubelchek engaged in several phone calls, and according\r\n  to Irick, they reached an oral agreement to the conveyance of the property.Â  Irick\r\n  allegedly asked Lubelchek, â€œto make [it] clear . . . what needs to be done, [to]\r\n  put [it] in writing and . . . [Lubelcheck] said that he would.â€Â  Irick believed\r\n  this conversation occurred sometime in February\r\n  of 2002.Â  The only writing\r\n  evidencing the alleged agreement is a February 19, 2002 letter from Lubelchek\r\n  to Irick stating:Â  Â \r\n\r\n\t[p]ursuant to our conversations regarding the wetland area owned\r\n  by [Wilmington] . . . this letter will confirm the partiesâ€™ understanding\r\n  regarding the conveyance of a portion of the wetland area to Midland. \r\n\tOwner will consider conveying . . . .878 acres . . .\r\n  provided the following conditions are satisfied prior to the conveyance, all at\r\n  Midlandâ€™s sole cost and expense; if any . . . . \r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).Â  In the letter, Wilmington enumerated conditions precedent to any\r\n  conveyance including: (1) Wilmington\r\n  obtains all necessary consents from its lender; (2) Wilmington obtains\r\n  necessary waivers from Winn-Dixie; (3) Midland prepares and submits all plans\r\n  and plats; (4) Midland prepares an easement; (5) Midland obtains all permits or\r\n  approvals; (6) Midland cooperates with regard to any zoning changes; (7)\r\n  Midland bears all costs, including attorney fees; and (8) Midland obtains\r\n  approval from the City of Summerville regarding zoning.\r\nIrick believed this letter constituted a binding and enforceable\r\n  agreement between Midland and Wilmington requiring Wilmington to convey the\r\n  wetland and border parcels if the conditions precedent were met. \r\nFollowing the Irick/Lubelchek telephone conversation, but prior to\r\n  the February 19 letter, Irick informed his attorney, Lewis Horton, that Midland and Wilmington had resolved the drainage problem.Â  After Horton reviewed the\r\n  February 19 letter, however, he told Irick the letter did not indicate an\r\n  â€œunequivocal commitmentâ€ to convey and the letter did not â€œdovetail, so to\r\n  speakâ€ with Irickâ€™s description of the agreement.Â  \r\nThereafter, Horton sent Lubelchek a letter requesting confirmation\r\n  of the oral agreement.Â  In Hortonâ€™s August 28, 2002 letter, he requested Lubelchek\r\n  â€œadvise immediately of its intentionâ€ and to proceed to address the conditions\r\n  precedent required to be performed by Wilmington.Â  Horton recalled one\r\n  follow-up telephone conversation with Lubelchek, but received no responsive correspondence.\r\nSubsequently, Horton communicated with Jennifer Desser, Lubelcheckâ€™s\r\n  associate. Â By e-mail dated October 9, 2002, Dresser informed Lubelchek of her\r\n  continuing conversations with Irick and described the February 19 letter as\r\n  â€œsetting forth conditions to [Wilmingtonâ€™s] willingness to convey the\r\n  property.â€Â  \r\nBy later dated November 8, 2002, Horton requested a response from Wilmington within ten days.Â  The record does not reflect a response. Â In a later e-mail to\r\n  Lubelchek, Horton made no mention of Midlandâ€™s desire to obtain the wetland and\r\n  border parcels, but requested a â€œletter [from Wilmington] committing to handle\r\n  the surface water nuisance problem currently existing on [its] property.â€[3]\r\nAfter receiving no response from Wilmingtonâ€™s counsel on either\r\n  the proposed conveyance or the drainage problem, Horton e-mailed Lubelchek and\r\n  requested an immediate response, asking whether Wilmington would:Â  \r\n\r\n\t1. Convey the property in satisfaction of any and all claims as\r\n  originally discussed.\r\n\t2. Convey the property for consideration including satisfaction of\r\n  any and all claims.\r\n\t3. Give a commitment to handle the surface water drainage problem\r\n  on [Wilmingtonâ€™s] property so as to allow [Midland] to build a maximum of 48\r\n  additional units on their own property.\r\n\t4. Ignore the problem . . . .\r\n\r\nOnce again Wilmington did not respond and Midland filed this action alleging, inter alia,\r\n  breach of contract, fraudulent misrepresentation, violation of the UTPA, and\r\n  promissory estoppel.Â  The trial court granted Wilmington summary judgment on\r\n  all causes of action.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the\r\n  grant of a summary judgment motion, appellate courts apply the same standard governing\r\n  the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Walsh v. Woods, 371 S.C. 319,\r\n  324, 638 S.E2d 85, 88 (Ct. App. 2006). Â Summary judgment is proper when there\r\n  is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to\r\n  judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  On appeal from an order\r\n  granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities,\r\n  conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most\r\n  favorable to the non-moving party below.Â  Willis v. Wu, 362 S.C. 146,\r\n  151, 607 S.E.2d 63, 65 (2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; Existence of Valid\r\n  and Enforceable Agreement\r\nMidland contends\r\n  the trial court erred in finding as a matter of law that no valid, enforceable contract\r\n  existed.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe essential\r\n  terms of a contract are offer, acceptance of the offer, and valuable consideration.Â  Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of South Carolina, 354 S.C. 397, 406, 581\r\n  S.E.2d 161, 166 (2003).Â  In order to have a valid and enforceable contract,\r\n  there must be a meeting of the minds between the parties with regard to all\r\n  essential and material terms of the agreement.Â  Patricia Grand Hotel v.\r\n    MacGuire Enters., 372 S.C. 634, 638, 643 S.E.2d 692, 694 (Ct. App. 2007). Â The\r\n  â€œmeeting of the mindsâ€ requirement cannot be met by the â€œsecret purpose or\r\n  intention on the part of one of the parties, stored away in his mind and not\r\n  brought to the attention of the other party, but must be based on purpose and\r\n  intention which has been made known or which, from all the circumstances,\r\n  should be known.â€Â  Player v. Chandler, 299 S.C. 101, 105, 382 S.E.2d 891,\r\n  894 (1989).Â  Â Â \r\nThe record before\r\n  us evinces no meeting of the minds between Midland and Wilmington.Â  There is no\r\n  indication essential terms were discussed. Instead, there is only Irickâ€™s belief\r\n  that a verbal understanding was reached and a letter from Wilmingtonâ€™s counsel\r\n  stating Wilmington would â€œconsiderâ€ conveying the wetland parcel provided\r\n  certain conditions were satisfied.Â  Furthermore, Midlandâ€™s own attorney\r\n  counseled Irick that the February 19 letter was not an â€œunequivocal commitmentâ€\r\n  to convey.Â  We agree the February 19 letter does not contain the essential\r\n  terms of a contract and find no error in the trial courtâ€™s legal finding that\r\n  no contract existed.\r\nII.&nbsp; Statute of Frauds\r\nMidland Parkway argues\r\n  the trial court erred in finding the statute of frauds barred the enforcement\r\n  of any oral agreement.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nA.&nbsp; Sufficiency of Writings\r\nMidland\r\n  Parkway argues sufficient writings\r\n  memorializing the alleged agreement exist.Â  We disagree.\r\nPursuant\r\n  to the South Carolina Statute of Frauds, any contract for an interest in land\r\n  must be in writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 32-3-10(4) (2007).Â  A writing sufficient to remove an oral\r\n  agreement from the Statute of Frauds â€œmust reasonably identify the subject matter\r\n  of the contract, sufficiently indicate a contract has been made between the\r\n  parties, and state with reasonable certainty the essential terms of the\r\n  agreement.â€Â  Smith v. McClam, 289 S.C. 452, 456, 346 S.E.2d 720, 723\r\n  (1986).Â  \r\nIn this case, no\r\n  sufficient writing exists to satisfy the Statute of Frauds.Â  Midland contends\r\n  the February 19 Letter from Lubelchek and the October 9, 2002 e-mail\r\n  from Dresser together satisfy the writing requirement.Â  However, neither the\r\n  letter nor the e-mail sufficiently describes the elements essential for a\r\n  contract for the conveyance of land.Â  As previously discussed, the February 19\r\n  letter does not contain the essential terms of an agreement.Â  The e-mail merely\r\n  explains Irickâ€™s continued interest in the property and describes the status of\r\n  the February 19 requirements. Â These writings, individually or read together,\r\n  fail to satisfy the writing requirement of the Statute of Frauds. Â Â Accordingly,\r\n  we find the trial judge did not err in granting summary judgment.\r\nB.&nbsp; Part Performance Exception\r\n  to the Statute of Frauds \r\nMidland argues its part performance of the contract is\r\n  sufficient to avoid the Statute of Frauds.Â  We find this issue not preserved\r\n  for our review.Â  An issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal but must\r\n  have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.Â  Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000).Â  In this case, the trial\r\n  court did not rule on the part performance exception to the Statute of Frauds.Â \r\n  Accordingly, this issue is not preserved for our review. \r\nIII.&nbsp; Promissory\r\n  Estoppel\r\nNext, Midland argues the court erred in not finding Wilmington estopped from denying the contract.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe elements of\r\n  promissory estoppel are: â€œ(1) the presence of a promise unambiguous in its\r\n  terms; (2) reasonable reliance upon the promise by the party to whom the\r\n  promise is made; (3) the reliance is expected and foreseeable by the party who\r\n  makes the promise; and (4) the party to whom the promise is made must sustain\r\n  injury in reliance on the promise.â€Â  Rushing v. McKinney, 370 S.C. 280,\r\n  295, 633 S.E.2d 917, 925 (Ct. App. 2006) (emphasis omitted).\r\nMidland failed to\r\n  show the existence of an unambiguous promise.Â  As discussed above, no evidence\r\n  in the record indicates a meeting of the minds as to the alleged agreement. Â The\r\n  letter indicating Wilmington would â€œconsiderâ€ conveying the wetland parcel is\r\n  ambiguous, as explained to Irick by Midlandâ€™s counsel.Â  We find no error by the\r\n  trial court in denying Midland recovery on its claim\r\n  of promissory estoppel.\r\nIV.&nbsp; Fraudulent\r\n  Misrepresentation \r\nMidland argues the\r\n  trial court erred in finding insufficient evidence to maintain a claim for\r\n  fraudulent misrepresentation.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe elements of\r\n  an action for fraud based on a representation include:Â  1) a representation; 2)\r\n  falsity; 3) its materiality; (4)\r\n  knowledge of the falsity or a reckless disregard of its truth or falsity; (5)\r\n  intent that the representation be acted upon; (6) the hearerâ€™s ignorance of its falsity; (7) the hearerâ€™s\r\n  reliance upon its truth; (8) the hearerâ€™s right to rely thereon; and (9) the\r\n  hearerâ€™s consequent and proximate injury.â€Â  Redwend Ltd. Partnership v.\r\n    Edwards, 354 S.C. 459, 473, 581 S.E.2d 496, 503-04 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  All\r\n  elements in an action for fraudulent misrepresentation must be met.Â  See Oâ€™Shields v. Southern Fountain Mobile Homes, Inc., 262 S.C. 276, 281,\r\n  204 S.E.2d 50, 52 (1974) (finding lack of any one of the elements of fraudulent\r\n  misrepresentation fatal to recovery).Â  \r\nIn this case, even\r\n  if we assume all other elements are met, Midland fails to establish the element\r\n  of the right to rely on the alleged misrepresentation.Â  Whether reliance is\r\n  justified requires the court to review the attendant circumstances.Â  Elders\r\n    v. Parker, 286 S.C. 228, 233, 332 S.E.2d 563, 567 (Ct. App. 1985). Â The\r\n  general rule is that questions concerning reliance and its reasonableness are\r\n  for the jury.Â  Unlimited Servs., Inc. v. Macklen Enters., 303 S.C. 384, 387,\r\n  401 S.E.2d 153, 155 (1991).Â  However, the trial court may rule on the reasonableness\r\n  of the reliance as a matter of law where the party asserting the\r\n  misrepresentation fails to provide evidence of a factual dispute on the issue.Â  See Moorhead v. First Piedmont Bank &amp; Trust Co., 273\r\n  S.C. 356, 360, 256 S.E.2d 414, 416 (1979) (finding no jury issue on question of\r\n  reasonableness of reliance).\r\nWe find the trial\r\n  court did not err in finding Midlandâ€™s did not reasonably rely on a\r\n  misrepresentation by Wilmington.Â  Even assuming Irick could reasonably rely on\r\n  an oral representation by Libelcheck in a telephone conversation, the February\r\n  19 Letter and Midlandâ€™s counselâ€™s advice rendered any further\r\n  reliance on the alleged agreement unreasonable as a matter of law.Â  \r\n\r\n  V.Â  South Carolina Unfair Trade\r\n    Practices Act\r\nFinally, Midland contends it is entitled to proceed on its claim under the UTPA.Â Â  We find Midland abandoned this issue.\r\nAn issue is deemed\r\n  abandoned and will not be considered on appeal if the argument is raised in a\r\n  brief but not supported by authority.Â  Glasscock, Inc. v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d 689, 691 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  In\r\n  the present case, Midland failed to cite any authority in support of its\r\n  argument that it was entitled to proceed on its UTPA claim.Â  Accordingly, this\r\n  court need not consider this issue on appeal.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, we find the trial judge properly granted summary judgment on all of Midlandâ€™s causes of action.Â  Accordingly, the trial judgeâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nANDERSON, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We\r\n  decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]&nbsp; His brother, Lawton Irick, is the only other\r\n  partner.Â  \r\n[3]&nbsp; Midland intended to build additional units on\r\n  its existing property and the number of units it could construct depended on\r\n  whether Wilmington would handle the drainage problem on its own property or\r\n  whether Midland would be required to construct a retention pond, thereby\r\n  decreasing the amount of land available for construction. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-084","title":"First Bank v.

Wright, as Personal Representative for the Estate of Yvonne Chyrelle K.\r\n  McRae, has appealed in this matter involving foreclosure of a real estate\r\n  mortgage on property formerly owned by Yvonne McRae.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nIn his motion to the special referee to set aside the foreclosure\r\n  and sale, Roger McRae, who was then Yvonne McRaeâ€™s surviving spouse and the\r\n  Personal Representative of her estate, asserted in relevant part as follows:\r\n\r\n\t3.Â  That First Bank of Dillon brought the above action against\r\n  Yvonne Chyrelle McRae (only later changed the caption of the case to reflect\r\n  the Personal Representative of her estate as defendant, since she had died in\r\n  May 2004.), which is a foreclosure on her property situated at the corner of\r\n  Calhoun Street and Highway 57 South in Dillon.\r\n\t4.Â  That in August 2003, Yvonne C. McRae, had disputed, in a\r\n  letter to the officials at First Bank, the validity of said mortgage . . . and\r\n  she was in the process of filing suit against the Bank for release of said\r\n  mortgage just before she died.\r\n\t5.Â  That Roger McRae, the Personal Representative for the Estate\r\n  of Yvonne C. McRae, was hospitalized . . . on March 22, 2005, the date of the\r\n  foreclosure hearing . . . and was not able to appear and present his defense\r\n  against the claims of the Plaintiff, which resulted in the issuance of an order\r\n  for sale by default judgment. \r\n\t6. That Roger E. McRae, the Personal Representative for the Estate\r\n  of Yvonne C. McRae, was not served a notice of sale of the property\r\n  ordered foreclosed, as is required by South Carolina law; and no certification of service is filed in the Court of Common Pleas.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe special referee denied the motion to set aside the foreclosure\r\n  and sale on the basis it was untimely made.Â  Â Â \r\nIn the Statement of Issues on Appeal, Wright now asserts the\r\n  following four issues: Â (1) â€œthe appellant [i.e., Roger E. McRae, as the\r\n  Personal Representative for the Estate of Yvonne Chyrelle K. McRae] and heirs\r\n  at law were not enjoined as defendants pursuant to state law for the lower\r\n  court to issue an order of foreclosure on real property under his jurisdictionâ€;\r\n  (2) â€œthe Special Referee acted with prejudice in enjoining the appellant as\r\n  defendant at a hearing of default and ordering a foreclosure saleâ€; (3) â€œthere\r\n  was no transcript of record for the default hearing made, preserved, or filed\r\n  in the office of the clerk of courtâ€; and (4) â€œthere was no certificate of\r\n  service of the Order or Judgment from the default hearing and no notice\r\n  of judgment from the lower court, and thus [this] prejudiced the subsequent\r\n  rights of the appellant in the foreclosure proceedings.â€Â  \r\nThe only issues that were arguably raised below relate to the\r\n  amendment of the pleadings and the service of the foreclosure order.Â  However,\r\n  we find no error in the special refereeâ€™s determination that the motion to set\r\n  aside was untimely made.Â  Moreover, as to the amendment of the pleadings to add\r\n  the Personal Representative for the Estate of Yvonne Chyrelle K. McRae as a\r\n  party, we note it is not necessary to make the personal representative of a\r\n  deceased mortgagor a party to an action of foreclosure.Â  See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 29-3-610 (2007) (â€œIt shall not be necessary to make the personal\r\n  representative of a deceased mortgagor a party to any foreclosure proceeding\r\n  and no sale heretofore made under foreclosure proceedings to which the personal\r\n  representative of a deceased mortgagor was not a party shall be invalid by\r\n  reason of the absence of such personal representative.â€).Â  \r\nAs to the lack of a transcript, this was never raised to and ruled\r\n  upon by the special referee.Â  Accordingly, it is not preserved for our\r\n  consideration.Â  See Pye v.\r\n    Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 564, 633\r\n  S.E.2d 505, 510&nbsp;(2006) (â€œIt is well settled that an issue\r\n  cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must\r\n  have been raised to and ruled upon\r\n  by the trial court to be preserved.â€); Wilder Corp. v.\r\n    Wilke,&nbsp;330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733&nbsp;(1998) (â€œIt is\r\n  axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised\r\n  for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised\r\n  to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€); Gurganious v.

McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General\r\n  John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General \r\n\t\t\t\tSalley W. Elliott; and Solicitor Warren B. Giese, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  Jerene Markwell Hayward (Hayward) was convicted of first-degree\r\n  burglary, the lesser-included offense of assault and battery of a high and\r\n  aggravated nature (ABHAN), petit larceny, and possession of marijuana.Â  He was\r\n  sentenced to consecutive terms of thirty (30) years for first-degree burglary\r\n  and ten (10) years for ABHAN, plus concurrent terms of thirty (30) days each\r\n  for the remaining convictions.Â  Hayward argues the trial court erred in: (1)\r\n  admitting an impermissibly suggestive show-up identification; and (2) denying\r\n  his motion for mistrial after a witness for the State commented on Haywardâ€™s exercise of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.Â  We affirm. [1]\r\nFACTS\r\nHayward was accused of\r\n  burglarizing the home of Jeffrey Connell and assaulting Connellâ€™s domestic\r\n  employee on April 13, 2004.Â  On that same afternoon, Ronald Cowart, a\r\n  landscaper, was in route to Crescent Lake Subdivision when Hayward ran out in\r\n  front of Cowartâ€™s truck, exclaiming two people were in pursuit of him.Â  Cowart\r\n  talked with Hayward and gave him a ride.Â  Cowart observed Hayward was a tall,\r\n  slender black male, with close-cut hair and a mark or tattoo on his neck.Â  Hayward was wearing baggy blue jeans and a dark, long-sleeved shirt.Â  He was carrying a\r\n  backpack.Â  Hayward eventually left Cowartâ€™s vehicle to find a store and a\r\n  phone.Â  Cowart alerted the police in response to conduct he believed was â€œout\r\n  of the ordinaryâ€ and the noticeable police activity in the area. \r\nPolice arrested Hayward, informed him of his Miranda rights, and summoned Cowart several hours\r\n  later to identify Hayward.Â  At the site of arrest Hayward was handcuffed and\r\n  surrounded by police cars and uniformed officers.Â  Cowart positively identified\r\n  Hayward as the man he had spoken with and picked up earlier.Â  He testified,\r\n  â€œI said yes this is him, I know him.â€Â  \r\nEric Barnes, an\r\n  investigator with Richland County Sheriffâ€™s Department, was responsible for\r\n  directing the investigation.Â  As he arrived on the scene where Hayward was\r\n  detained, he recalled Hayward was shouting that he was innocent.Â  Barnes\r\n  introduced himself to Hayward and looked at Haywardâ€™s shoeprint to determine if\r\n  it was similar to one left at the crime scene. Â Barnes observed what he thought\r\n  was blood on Haywardâ€™s shoes, removed them, and secured them as evidence.\r\nBarnes continued\r\n  talking with Hayward, commenting that Hayward â€œwas going to have a hard time\r\n  explaining how the victimâ€™s blood got on the shoe.â€Â  Hayward said â€œhe was in\r\n  the house but it was the other guy that kicked her or hit the lady, not him.â€\r\nAt headquarters,\r\n  Barnes verbally informed Hayward of his Miranda rights, asked Hayward if he understood, and attempted to obtain information from him.Â  Barnes testified Hayward denied he made the statement at the arrest site claiming he was not the one who\r\n  kicked the lady.Â  Hayward continued to deny everything about the case at that\r\n  point, becoming louder and louder as the discussion progressed.Â  When Barnes\r\n  realized it was futile to continue, he decided to adjourn the session,\r\n  concluding, â€œit became apparent in my mind that [Hayward] didnâ€™t want to give a\r\n  statement.â€\r\nHayward was\r\n  indicted for first-degree\r\n  burglary, petit larceny, kidnapping, assault and battery with intent to kill,\r\n  and possession of marijuana.\r\nIn a hearing\r\n  pursuant to Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, (1964), Hayward challenged\r\n  the suggestiveness of Cowartâ€™s identification of him at the arrest site.Â  The\r\n  trial court ruled Cowartâ€™s identification was admissible.\r\nAdditionally, Hayward moved for a mistrial on the ground Barnes impermissibly commented on Haywardâ€™s constitutional right to remain silent.Â  The trial court denied Haywardâ€™s motion\r\n  and ruled Hayward had not invoked his right to remain silent at the time Barnes\r\n  decided it was futile to continue the session.Â  Therefore, Barnesâ€™ comment that\r\n  Haywardâ€™s statement was not forthcoming did not reflect on Haywardâ€™s\r\n  invocation of his Fifth Amendment right.Â  \r\nThe jury found Hayward guilty of first-degree burglary, the\r\n  lesser-included offense of ABHAN, petit larceny, and possession of marijuana.Â \r\n  The trial court sentenced Hayward to consecutive terms of thirty years (30) for\r\n  first-degree burglary and ten (10) years for ABHAN, plus concurrent terms of\r\n  thirty days (30) each for the remaining convictions.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases,\r\n  the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Baccus,\r\n  367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).Â  Thus, an appellate court is bound\r\n  by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  Id. at 48, 625 S.E.2d at 220. Â This same standard of review applies to preliminary\r\n  factual findings in determining the admissibility of certain evidence in\r\n  criminal cases.Â  State v. Preslar, 364 S.C. 466, 472, 613 S.E.2d 381,\r\n  384 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.&nbsp; Admissibility\r\n  of Show-Up IdentificationÂ  \r\nHayward contends\r\n  Cowartâ€™s identification of him at the arrest site should be suppressed because\r\n  it was so suggestive that Cowartâ€™s objectivity was compromised. Â We disagree. \r\nGenerally, the\r\n  decision to admit an eyewitness identification is at the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion,\r\n  or the commission of prejudicial legal error.Â  State v. Moore, 343 S.C.\r\n  282, 288, 540 S.E.2d 445, 448 (2000); State v. McCord, 349 S.C. 477,\r\n  481, 562 S.E.2d 689, 691 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  However, an eyewitness\r\n  identification which is unreliable because of suggestive police procedures is\r\n  constitutionally inadmissible as a matter of law.Â  Moore, 343 S.C. at\r\n  288, 540 S.E.2d at 448.Â  \r\nA criminal\r\n  defendant may be deprived of due process of law by an unnecessarily suggestive\r\n  identification procedure conducive to irreparable mistaken identification.Â  State\r\n    v. Roach, 364 S.C. 422, 429-30, 613 S.E.2d 791, 795 (2005); State v.\r\n      Brown, 356 S.C. 496, 503, 589 S.E.2d 781, 785 (Ct. App. 2003); State v.\r\n        Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 79, 538 S.E.2d 257, 264 (Ct. App. 2000); State\r\n          v. Blassingame, 338 S.C. 240, 251, 525 S.E.2d 535, 541 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nThe\r\n  United States Supreme Court and the South Carolina Supreme Court have\r\n  established a two-prong inquiry to determine the admissibility of an\r\n  out-of-court identification.Â  Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 196 (1972); Moore, 343 S.C. at 287, 540 S.E.2d at 448.Â  A court must determine\r\n  whether the identification process was unduly suggestive.Â  Moore, 343\r\n  S.C. at 287, 540 S.E.2d at 448.Â  Only if the identification procedure was\r\n  unduly suggestive does the court need to consider the next step, whether the\r\n  out-of-court identification was nevertheless so reliable that no substantial\r\n  likelihood of misidentification existed.Â  Id.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSingle\r\n  person show-ups have been sharply criticized as unnecessarily suggestive. Â Mansfield , 343 S.C. at 79, 538 S.E.2d at 264.Â  However, suggestiveness alone does\r\n  not require the exclusion of evidence.Â  State v Stewart, 275 S.C. 447,\r\n  450, 272 S.E.2d 628, 629 (1980). Â The central question is whether, under the\r\n  totality of the circumstances, the identification was reliable even though the\r\n  confrontation procedure was suggestive. Id.; Mansfield, 343 S.C.\r\n  at 79, 538 S.E.2d at 264.Â  Reliability is the â€œlinchpin in determining the\r\n  admissibility of identification testimony.â€Â  Mansfield, 343 S.C. at 79,\r\n  538 S.E.2d at 264.Â  To determine whether identification is reliable, we must\r\n  consider the factors set forth in Biggers.Â  409 U.S. at 199.Â  The factors to be considered are: \r\n\r\n\t1) the\r\n  opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime; 2)\r\n  the witnessâ€™s degree of attention; 3) the accuracy of the witnessâ€™s prior\r\n  description of the criminal; 4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the\r\n  witness at the confrontation; and 5) the amount of time between the crime and\r\n  the confrontation.\r\n\r\nBiggers, 409 U.S. at 200; Mansfield, 343 S.C. at 79,\r\n  538 S.E.2d at 264. \r\nAt the arrest site,\r\n  Hayward was presented in handcuffs, surrounded by police cars and uniformed\r\n  officers.Â  Notwithstanding the somewhat suggestive nature of the setting, Cowartâ€™s\r\n  identification of Hayward was reliable in light of the totality of the\r\n  circumstances.Â  \r\nCowart had opportunity\r\n  to observe Hayward in close proximity, during daylight hours, on the day the\r\n  crimes were committed.Â  Cowartâ€™s attention was focused on Hayward because of\r\n  his unusual behavior.Â  He was suspicious of Hayward to the point he removed his\r\n  keys and cell phone from Haywardâ€™s view, and he ultimately alerted the police\r\n  about his contact with Hayward.\r\nCowart described Hayward in accurate detail to the police as a tall, slender black male with close cut hair.Â \r\n  He noted Haywardâ€™s clothing, observed the backpack he carried, and identified a\r\n  green cigarette package that Hayward pulled out of the bag.Â  Cowart\r\n  unequivocally and without hesitation confirmed Hayward was the man he picked up\r\n  in the victimâ€™s neighborhood on the afternoon of April 13, 2004.Â  Moreover, the\r\n  amount of time between Cowartâ€™s afternoon encounter with Hayward and the\r\n  show-up identification at the arrest site was approximately three hours.Â  \r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  trial court concluded:\r\n\tCase law\r\n  indicates that even if the identification is unnecessarily suggestive the\r\n  evidence need not be excluded if the totality of the circumstances indicates\r\n  that the identification is reliable.Â  And I find that there is sufficient\r\n  evidence that has been shown to this court that the identification is reliable.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing\r\n  Cowartâ€™s identification for indicia of reliability, the trial court considered\r\n  the factors required under Biggers.Â  The trial court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion when it denied Haywardâ€™s motion to suppress Cowartâ€™s identification.\r\nII.&nbsp; Failure to Grant Motion\r\n  for Mistrial\r\nHayward contends the\r\n  trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial when Barnes allegedly commented\r\n  on Haywardâ€™s exercise of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe decision to grant or deny a mistrial is within the\r\n  sound discretion of the trial court.Â  State v. Stanley, 365 S.C. 24, 33,\r\n  615 S.E.2d 455, 460 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  The trial courtâ€™s decision will not be\r\n  overturned on appeal absent an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of\r\n  law.Â  Id.; State v. Rowlands, 343 S.C. 454, 458, 539 S.E.2d 717,\r\n  719 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  A mistrial should only be granted when â€œabsolutely\r\n  necessary,â€ and a defendant must show both error and resulting prejudice in\r\n  order to be entitled to a mistrial.Â  Stanley, 365 S.C. at 34, 615 S.E.2d\r\n  at 460.Â  Whether a mistrial is manifestly necessary is a fact specific\r\n  inquiry.Â  Id.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nHayward asserts Barnesâ€™ comment, â€œit became apparent in my\r\n  mind that [Hayward] didnâ€™t want to give a statement,â€ was an impermissible\r\n  reference to Haywardâ€™s right to remain silent under Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610 (1976).Â  In Doyle, the\r\n  Supreme Court held: \r\n\r\n\tâ€˜[W]hen a person is informed, as Miranda requires, that he\r\n  may remain silent, that anything he says may be used against him, â€¦ it does not\r\n  comport with due process to permit the prosecution during the trial to call\r\n  attention to his silence at the time of arrest and to insist that because he\r\n  did not speak about the facts of the case at that time, as he was told he need\r\n  not do, an unfavorable inference might be drawn as to the truth of his trial\r\n  testimony.â€™Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 619 (quoting U.S. v. Hale, 422 U.S. 171, 182-83 (1975)).\r\nThe courts of South Carolina have\r\n  consistently recognized the significance of Doyle on post-arrest, post-Miranda silence.Â  â€œDoyle holds that the Due Process Clause prohibits the\r\n  government from commenting on an accusedâ€™s post-Miranda silence.â€Â  State\r\n    v. Simmons, 360 S.C. 33, 39, 599 S.E.2d 448, 450 (2004); Payne v. State,\r\n  355 S.C. 642, 645, 586 S.E.2d 857, 859 (2003) (holding â€œThe state may not\r\n  directly or indirectly comment on the defendantâ€™s right to remain silent.â€).Â  Our appellate courts have warned solicitors against violation of\r\n  the Doyle prohibition.Â  State v. Myers, 301 S.C. 251, 258-259,\r\n  391 S.E.2d 551, 555 (1990); State v. Arther, 290 S.C. 291, 350 S.E.2d\r\n  187 (1990); State v. Holliday, 333 S.C. 332, 509 S.E.2d 280 (Ct. App.\r\n  1998); State v. Gray, 304 S.C. 482, 405 S.E.2d 420 (Ct. App. 1991). However, â€œ[t]he underpinnings of Doyle,\r\n  and the need for its application, are diminished where a defendant waives his\r\n  right to silence.Â  Simmons, 360 S.C. at 40, 599 S.E.2d at 451.\r\nIn the\r\n  instant case the trial court concluded the State made a sufficient showing that\r\n  Hayward was advised of his rights under Miranda.Â  The trial court\r\n  found after being advised of those rights, Hayward essentially waived them by\r\n  voluntarily making statements and utterances.Â  â€œI find based on what has been\r\n  presented that the defendant had not at that point and [sic] time invoked his\r\n  right to remain silent.Â  For that reason I will permit the testimony to\r\n  continue.Â  I deny the motion for a mistrial.â€\r\nPolice\r\n  informed Hayward of his Miranda rights at the arrest site.Â \r\n  Nevertheless, Hayward continued to shout about his innocence and professed the\r\n  acts were committed by other perpetrators.Â  After hearing his Miranda rights again during the discussion with Barnes at headquarters, Hayward persisted in talking about his innocence, disclaiming things he had allegedly said\r\n  earlier.Â  In the context of ending the session because of its futility, Barnesâ€™\r\n  comment was not in response to Haywardâ€™s silence, because Hayward was not\r\n  silent, and had not yet invoked his right to remain silent.Â  The trial court did\r\n  not err in denying Haywardâ€™s motion for mistrial.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, SHORT, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-089","title":"SCDSS v.

Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Dale\r\n  Eugene Enos, Jr. and A Rainbow of Carpets (Appellants) appeal from the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s denial of their motion for a new trial and subsequent denial of their\r\n  motion to alter and amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59, SCRCP, following a\r\n  juryâ€™s verdict in favor of Jennifer Christmas for $30,000.Â  Holding Appellantsâ€™\r\n  successive motion pursuant to Rule 59, SCRCP, did not toll the time for serving\r\n  the notice of appeal, we dismiss the appeal as untimely.Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nThis\r\n  action arises from a motor vehicle accident that occurred when the vehicle in\r\n  which Jennifer Christmas was a passenger was struck from behind by a vehicle\r\n  driven by Dale Eugene Enos, Jr.Â  Jennifer and her husband Jay Christmas brought\r\n  this action against Enos and his employer A Rainbow of Carpets, Inc., alleging\r\n  causes of action for negligence, negligent entrustment, negligent hiring,\r\n  supervision, and training, and loss of consortium.Â   \r\nOn\r\n  November 30, 2005, the jury returned a general verdict in favor of Jennifer\r\n  Christmas in the amount of $30,000.Â  It awarded no damages to Jay Christmas.Â \r\n  Appellants filed a motion for a new trial on December 12, 2005.Â  The trial\r\n  court denied this motion in an order filed December 22, 2005.Â  Appellants\r\n  received this order on December 29, 2005 and on January 8, 2006, filed a motion\r\n  to reconsider or to alter or amend judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  The\r\n  trial court denied this motion February 22, 2006 in a form order.Â  Appellants\r\n  received written notice of the entry of this order on February 28, 2006.Â  They\r\n  served their notice of appeal on March 29, 2006.Â   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nâ€œThe requirement of service of the notice of appeal is\r\n  jurisdictional, i.e., if a party misses the deadline, the appellate\r\n  court lacks jurisdiction to consider the appeal and has no authority or\r\n  discretion to â€˜rescueâ€™ the delinquent party by extending or ignoring the deadline\r\n  for service of the notice.â€ Â Elam v. South Carolina Department of\r\n    Transportation, 361 S.C. 9, 14-15, 602 S.E.2d 772, 775 (2004).Â  An\r\n  appellant must serve the notice of appeal in a case appealed from the Court of\r\n  Common Pleas on all respondents within thirty days after receipt of written\r\n  notice of entry of the order or judgment.Â  Rule 203(b)(1), SCACR.Â  A timely\r\n  post-trial motion, including a motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant\r\n  to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, stays the time for an appeal for all parties until\r\n  receipt of written notice of entry of the order granting or denying such\r\n  motion.Â  Elam, 361 S.C. at 15, 602 S.E.2d at 775.Â  However, a successive\r\n  post-trial motion, where a party simply recaptions a written motion for\r\n  judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) or new trial, which has been ruled\r\n  on, and resubmits it as a virtually identical, written Rule 59(e) motion does\r\n  not stay the time for the service of the notice of appeal.Â  Quality Trailer\r\n    Products v. CSL Equipment Co., 349 S.C. 216, 220, 562 S.E.2d 615, 618\r\n  (2002).Appellantsâ€™ motion to alter or amend is virtually identical to their\r\n  motion for a new trial other than the caption and opening paragraphs setting\r\n  forth the procedural history.Â  In the motion to alter or amend, Appellants did\r\n  not request the trial court rule on an issue raised in the prior motion and not\r\n  ruled on nor did they challenge a new ruling.Â  Thus, as in Quality Trailer\r\n    Products, this successive motion did not stay the time for serving the\r\n  notice of appeal.Â  Appellants received the trial courtâ€™s order denying their\r\n  written motion for new trial on December 29, 2005.Â  They had thirty days from\r\n  this date in which to serve their notice of Appeal on the Christmases.Â \r\n  Appellants, however, did not serve the notice of appeal until March 29, 2006.Â \r\n  As the service of the notice of appeal was untimely, this court lacks\r\n  jurisdiction to consider the appeal.Â   \r\nAccordingly, the appeal is  \r\nDISMISSED.\r\nHUFF AND PIEPER, JJ., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-100","title":"State v.

Savitz, III, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney\r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant\r\n  Attorney General Shawn L. Reeves, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Harold W.\r\n  Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  Joseph Thomas seeks to vacate a conviction and sentence, arguing the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s denial of his motion for a continuance rendered his guilty plea\r\n  invalid.Â  In the alternative, Thomas seeks a new trial.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 2004, the Spartanburg County Grand Jury\r\n  indicted Thomas on one count of trafficking in more than 200 grams of cocaine, one\r\n  count of possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, and\r\n  one count of trafficking in more than ten grams of crack cocaine.Â  In addition,\r\n  Thomas was also facing a federal charge for conspiracy to escape.  \r\nOn July 5, 2005, the assistant United States attorney moved to dismiss the federal charge, purportedly so that Thomas could be\r\n  extradited to the Bahamas, where he had been charged with murder of a police\r\n  officer.Â  Although the details are not clear, there was allegedly an agreement\r\n  that, if the federal charges were dismissed, the State would likewise dismiss\r\n  the state charges, thus facilitating the extradition.  \r\nAt the request of the State, the attorney representing Thomas on\r\n  the state charges was relieved in February 2006 and a public defender was\r\n  appointed to represent him soon after.Â  The public defender first met with\r\n  Thomas on June 5, 2006, when he allegedly learned Thomasâ€™s trial on the state\r\n  charges was scheduled for the following week.Â  About that time, defense counsel\r\n  also received information about the alleged agreement under which the state\r\n  charges would be dismissed.Â   \r\nThe case was called for trial on June 12, 2006.Â  When the hearing\r\n  began, defense counsel moved for a continuance in the matter, requesting more\r\n  time to investigate whether the state charges against Thomas should have been\r\n  dismissed as a result of the charges pending against him in the Bahamas.Â  The trial court denied the request, noting the case had been on the docket since\r\n  March 2006.Â  In addition, the court found Thomas would suffer no legal\r\n  prejudice from the denial of the continuance because the disposition of the\r\n  other charges pending against Thomas would not affect the state charges.Â  \r\n \r\nFollowing a short recess after the denial of the continuance,\r\n  Thomas agreed to plead guilty to the charge of trafficking in more than 200\r\n  grams of cocaine.Â  In addition, the State agreed to dismiss the firearm charge\r\n  and the indictment for trafficking in crack cocaine.Â  The trial court accepted\r\n  Thomasâ€™s guilty plea and sentenced him to twenty-five years confinement.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œA motion for a\r\n  continuance is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and its\r\n  ruling on such motion will not be reversed without a clear showing of abuse of\r\n  discretion.â€Â  State v. Tanner, 299 S.C. 459, 462, 385 S.E.2d 832, 834\r\n  (1989).Â  â€œWhere there is no showing that any other evidence on behalf of\r\n  the appellant could have been produced, or that any other points could have\r\n  been raised had more time been granted for the purpose of preparing the case\r\n    for trial, the denial of a motion for continuance is not an abuse of\r\n  discretion.â€Â  State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 455, 459, 469 S.E.2d 49, 51-52\r\n  (1996) (emphasis added).Â  A guilty plea acts as a waiver of all\r\n  non-jurisdictional defects and defenses.Â  State v. McKennedy, 348 S.C.\r\n  270, 280, 559 S.E.2d 850, 855 (2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWe agree with the\r\n  State that Thomasâ€™s guilty plea amounted to a waiver of his argument that he\r\n  should have received a continuance.Â  See Whetsell v. State, 276\r\n  S.C. 295, 299, 277 S.E.2d 891, 892 (1981) (â€œThe general rule is that guilty\r\n  pleas, freely and voluntarily entered, act as a waiver of all\r\n  non-jurisdictional defects and defenses, including the claims of a violation of\r\n  a constitutional right prior to the plea.â€).Â   \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  defense counselâ€™s reason for requesting a continuance was to verify his\r\n  understanding that it was because of the pending state charges that federal\r\n  authorities had not taken Thomas into custody.Â  In response to the motion, the\r\n  solicitor advised the court that (1) a conviction and sentence on the state\r\n  charges would not prevent extradition; (2) the Bahamian government had not yet\r\n  begun the formal extradition process; and (3) such a process would take several\r\n  years.Â  Moreover, as the solicitor noted, Thomasâ€™s defense counsel had been\r\n  assigned to the case more than three months before the scheduled trial and the\r\n  State had incurred considerable expenses to secure the presence of certain\r\n  witnesses.Â  Under these circumstances, we hold defense counsel failed to make\r\n  any showing that a continuance would have enabled him to prepare more fully for\r\n  trial and the trial court therefore acted within its discretion in denying the\r\n  continuance.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, SHORT, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-115","title":"State v.

Markley Dennis, Jr., Circuit Court\r\n  Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2008-UP-116\r\nHeard January 8, 2008 â€“ Filed February 13,\r\n  2008Â Â Â  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tErnest Mitchell Griffith, of Beaufort; Stephen L. Brown, and Jeffrey\r\n  J. Wiseman, both of Charleston, for Appellants.\r\n\t\t\t\tJames H. Moss, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Janet\r\n  Miller brought suit against FerrellGas L.P., Inc. and Kenneth W. Ellis\r\n  (collectively FerrellGas) after sustaining injuries in an automobile accident.Â \r\n  The trial court granted Miller a directed verdict on the issue of negligence,\r\n  and the jury awarded her $785,000 in damages.Â  FerrellGas appeals.Â  We reverse\r\n  and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 15, 2001, Ronald Owens was driving Miller to Hilton Head Island to have an MRI for an injury she had sustained in a work-related\r\n  accident six days earlier when they were involved in an accident with a truck\r\n  driven by Kenneth Ellis, an employee of FerrellGas.Â  While traveling on Highway\r\n  170, Owens and Miller approached a caution light at the intersection of\r\n  Highways 802 and 170 where the truck driven by Ellis was stopped at a stop\r\n  sign.Â  Ellis testified he stopped at the stop sign and looked both ways.Â  A\r\n  road construction sign, which had not been there earlier in the day, obstructed\r\n  his view to the left.Â  Ellis looked to the right again and then eased out to\r\n  look around the sign.Â  When he did not see anything, he pulled out into the intersection\r\n  where his truck collided with the automobile in which Miller rode.Â  Ellis defended the actions he took on the day of the\r\n  accident and testified he was not the cause of the traffic accident.Â   \r\nMiller brought the present action seeking damages for the injuries\r\n  she allegedly sustained in the accident.Â  At the close of FerrellGasâ€™s case,\r\n  the trial court granted Millerâ€™s motion for directed verdict on the issue of\r\n  negligence.Â  Furthermore, the court noted the difficulty a motorist would face\r\n  in this situation and stated, â€œI donâ€™t know what youâ€™re supposed to do.Â  Are\r\n  you supposed to get out of the car and go to the front and check?Â  Thatâ€™s the\r\n  dilemma here.â€Â  After deliberations, the jury awarded Miller $785,000 in\r\n  damages.Â  The trial court denied FerrellGasâ€™s post-trial motion.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFerrellGas argues\r\n  the trial court erred in granting Miller a directed verdict motion on the issue\r\n  of negligence.Â  We agree.Â   \r\nWhen\r\n  reviewing the grant of a directed verdict, this court must view the evidence\r\n  and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the\r\n  party against whom the verdict was directed.Â  Heyward v. Christmas, 357\r\n  S.C. 202, 207, 593 S.E.2d 141, 144 (2004). Â If the evidence is susceptible to\r\n  more than one reasonable inference, the case should have been submitted to the\r\n  jury.Â  Id.Â  The court is not concerned with the weight of the evidence,\r\n  but whether there is any evidence from which the jury is warranted in making a\r\n  finding.Â  Washington v. Whitaker, 317 S.C. 108, 113-14, 451\r\n  S.E.2d 894, 897-98 (1994).Â  Furthermore, neither the trial court nor the\r\n  appellate court has authority to decide credibility issues or to resolve\r\n  conflicts in the testimony or evidence.Â  Erickson v. Jones St. Publishers,\r\n    LLC, 368 S.C. 444, 463, 629 S.E.2d 653, 663 (2006).Â  â€œThe appellate court\r\n  must determine whether a verdict for a party opposing the motion would be\r\n  reasonably possible under the facts as liberally construed in his favor.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nIn\r\n  the present case, there is no evidence indicating Miller, as a passenger in the\r\n  traffic accident, was negligent.Â  Therefore, the issue before us is whether the\r\n  record contains any evidence showing Ellis was not negligent.Â   \r\nEllis\r\n  was required by law to stop at the intersection of Highways 802 and 107.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2330(b) (2006) (requiring drivers to stop at stop signs\r\n  with a view of approaching traffic before entering the intersecting roadway).Â \r\n  After coming to a stop, Ellis was then required to â€œyield to the right-of-way to\r\n  any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as\r\n  to constitute an immediate hazard during the time when such driver is moving\r\n  across or within the intersection or junction of roadways.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court has previously addressed the duty of a driver\r\n  crossing over a highway, such as presented in this case, by explaining:  \r\n\r\n\tWhen a\r\n  motorist on an unfavored highway approaches a through highway he must bring his\r\n  car to a stop for such a time and in such a position as to be able to observe\r\n  the traffic conditions on the favored highway and govern his conduct\r\n  accordingly.Â  The duty to yield the right of way does not mean that the driver\r\n  on the unfavored highway must refrain from crossing the favored highway whenever\r\n  another vehicle is approaching thereon regardless of how far distant.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nWarren v. Watkins Motor Lines, 242 S.C. 331, 340, 130 S.E.2d 896, 901 (1963).Â  \r\n \r\nThe\r\n  court explained that travelers on both the favored and the unfavored highways\r\n  have a duty to use ordinary care in keeping a proper lookout for vehicles\r\n  approaching the intersection.Â  Id. Â at 341, 130 S.E.2d at 901.Â  The court held,\r\n  â€œIf there is a conflict in the testimony as to whether a car on the through\r\n  highway was approaching so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard or if\r\n  the conclusion to be drawn therefrom is doubtful and uncertain, the Court will\r\n  not decide the question as one of law and it must be submitted to the triers of\r\n  the fact.â€Â  Id. Â at 341, 130 S.E.2d at 901-02.Â   \r\nIn Cope v.\r\n  Eckert this court reiterated the duties set forth in Warren when a\r\n  driver is crossing or turning over a favored roadway.Â  284 S.C. 516, 327 S.E.2d\r\n  367 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  This court explained, â€œ[I]f there is no traffic\r\n  approaching so near as to constitute an immediate hazard, the driver on the\r\n  unfavored highway has a right to enter the intersection, and it then becomes\r\n  the duty of those approaching the intersection on the favored highway to yield\r\n  the right of way to him.â€Â  Id.Â  519, 327 S.E.2d at 369.\r\nIn the present case, Owens testified that as he approached the\r\n  caution light of the intersection, he was traveling between forty and\r\n  forty-five miles an hour.Â  He saw Ellisâ€™s truck stopped at the stop sign.Â  He\r\n  claimed that when Ellis pulled out in front of his vehicle, he was about fifty\r\n  to seventy-five yards away and had â€œno time to react.â€ Â \r\nEllis testified he was familiar with this intersection and had\r\n  driven through it earlier that day.Â  However, the scene at the intersection had\r\n  changed when he approached for a second time because a construction sign was\r\n  blocking his view.Â  He claimed that even\r\n  with the construction sign obstructing his view, he took precautions to ensure\r\n  the road was clear when he pulled into the intersection.Â  He stated he came to\r\n  a full stop when he approached the intersection and looked to his left and his\r\n  right.Â  Then he eased out to look around the sign and did not see anything\r\n  coming, so he pulled into the intersection.Â   \r\nUnder\r\n  the precedent of Warren and Cope, we find a jury issue was\r\n  created based on the facts of this case.Â  Specifically, we believe the record\r\n  contains some evidence from which a jury could infer Ellis was not negligent,\r\n  thus creating more than one inference with regards to negligence.Â  A jury could\r\n  reasonably infer Ellis proceeded into the intersection with enough caution and\r\n  without perceiving Owenâ€™s vehicle as an immediate threat.Â  Though we note the\r\n  great amount of evidence against FerrellGas, it is not our duty to weigh\r\n  evidence but to look for any evidence in the trial record from which a jury\r\n  could make more than one inference.Â  Because a jury could have inferred Ellis\r\n  was not negligent, the trial court improperly directed a verdict against\r\n  FerrellGas on the issue of negligence.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s grant of a directed verdict and remand this case for a new trial.Â \r\n \r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.[1]\r\nHUFF\r\n  and PIEPER, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1]Â  As we have remanded for a new trial, we need not\r\n  address FerrellGasâ€™s remaining issues.Â  See Murphy v.

Cook, of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\n\t\t\t\tJ. Marvin Mullis, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Employer, White Oak Conference Center (Employer),[1] contends the circuit court erred in reversing the decision of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission finding Claimant, John Evans (Evans), (1)\r\n  had not suffered compensable injuries to his left knee and foot as a result of\r\n  an on the job fall, and (2) had reached maximum medical improvement.Â  We\r\n  reverse in part, affirm in part, and remand.[2]  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn January 9, 2004, while working for\r\n  Employer, Evans fell 15 feet from a ladder to the concrete floor below.Â  Evans\r\n  landed directly on his feet.Â  An accident report, filled out at the scene of\r\n  the accident, indicates injury to Evansâ€™ ankle.[3]Â \r\n  Later that day, after finishing work, Evans went to the Fairfield Memorial Hospital complaining of problems with his right ankle and foot.Â  He did not complain\r\n  of any left ankle or knee pain.Â  Evans was diagnosed with a sprain of the right\r\n  ankle and referred to Dr. Steven Barnett. Â Â \r\nEvans\r\n  reported to Dr. Barnett, three days after the fall, complaining of a tremendous\r\n  pain and swelling around the right ankle and foot.Â  Evans denied any other\r\n  trauma or injury.Â  Dr. Barnett indicated Evans was â€œnot progressing as quickly\r\n  as I had hoped,â€ and referred Evans to an orthopaedist, Dr. Bradley Presnal of\r\n  the Moore Orthopaedic Clinic.Â  Dr. Presnal diagnosed a right ankle sprain. Â Because\r\n  Evans continued to complain of right ankle pain even after a lengthy recovery period,\r\n  Dr. Presnal referred Evans to Dr. Frank Noojin to rule out the need for\r\n  arthroscopy. Â Â \r\nOn\r\n  August 31, 2004, Evans saw Dr. Green Neal via a referral from Evans lawyer.Â  Evans\r\n  complained to Dr. Neal of left and right ankle pain and left knee pain.Â  Dr.\r\n  Neal found â€œan enlarged right ankle . . . crepitation in the knees . . . [and\r\n  that] the left ankle does not have that much crepitation but [Evans] complains\r\n  of pain in it.â€Â  Dr. Neal diagnosed Evans with Type II diabetes suggesting it â€œis\r\n  the reason [Evans] injuries would not heal.â€Â  Evans was also diagnosed with pre-existing\r\n  gouty arthritis with elevated uric acid levels which Dr. Neal believed complicated\r\n  Evans injuries and resulted in slowed recovery and failure to heal.Â  He also\r\n  found these conditions were aggravated or worsened by the trauma from the\r\n  fall.Â  Dr. Neal scheduled additional MRIâ€™s of Evansâ€™ left knee and ankle for\r\n  September 14, 2004. Â Â \r\nMeanwhile, on September 2, 2004, Evans returned to Dr. Noojin, but\r\n  did not complain of any injury or pain to his left ankle or knee.Â  Dr. Noojin found\r\n  Evans at maximum medical improvement (MMI) and assigned a 3% permanent partial\r\n  impairment rating to his right lower extremity.Â   \r\nEvans\r\n  returned to Dr. Neal on September 28, 2004.Â  Dr. Neal found: Evansâ€™ left ankle\r\n  showed a contusion with a small amount of fluid, possibly associated with\r\n  plantar fasciitis; Evansâ€™ left knee showed a thinning of the ACL suggesting\r\n  degenerative changes; and Evansâ€™ right ankle evidenced a contusion and tear.Â \r\n  Finally, on November 3, 2004, Evans returned to Dr. Noojin complaining, for the\r\n  first time, of bilateral ankle pain.Â  Yet, Evans did not bring the new MRIâ€™s\r\n  nor mention to Dr. Noojin the findings of Dr. Neal.Â  Dr. Noojin reiterated his\r\n  previous findings and discharged Evans at MMI. Â Â \r\nAfter an evidentiary hearing, the single commissioner\r\n  issued an order finding Evans had reached MMI, awarding six percent permanent\r\n  partial disability for the lower right extremity, and denying compensability\r\n  for the injuries to the left foot and knee.Â  The single commissioner explained,\r\n  â€œI give more weight to the reports of the authorized treating physicians than I\r\n  do the testimony of [Evansâ€™] physician, who is not a certified orthopedist.â€Â \r\n  The order was affirmed by the full commission.Â  Evans then appealed to the\r\n  circuit court.Â   \r\nAfter a hearing, the circuit court found â€œ[t]he substantial\r\n  evidence in the record is susceptible of but one reasonable inference,\r\n  i.e. that the injuries to [Evansâ€™] left lower extremity were compensable as\r\n  having been sustained along with the injuries to his right lower extremity in\r\n  the admitted work accident.â€Â  (emphasis in original)Â  Further, the circuit court\r\n  noted no evidence was presented to contradict the â€œexpert medical opinion of\r\n  Dr. Neal indicating [Evansâ€™] left sided injuries were caused or at the\r\n  very least aggravated by the work fall and injuries.â€ Â Thus, the circuit court reversed\r\n  the denial of compensability for Evansâ€™ left-sided injuries, reversed the order\r\n  of permanent partial disability, and remanded to the full commission for an\r\n  order of causally related medical care. Â This appeal follows.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAppellate review of\r\n  workersâ€™ compensation decisions is governed by the South Carolina Administrative\r\n  Procedures Act (APA).Â  Shealy v.

Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C.\r\n  130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  Pursuant to the APA, a reviewing\r\n  court may affirm the decision of an agency or remand the case for further\r\n  proceedings, or may reverse or modify the decision of an agency if the\r\n  findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions of that agency are â€œclearly\r\n  erroneous in view of the reliable probative and substantial evidence on the\r\n  whole record.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§1-23-380(A)(6) (2005); see also Bass\r\n    v. Kenco Group, 366 S.C. 450, 456, 622 S.E.2d 577, 580 (Ct. App. 2005).Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nThe\r\n  commission is the ultimate fact finder and is specifically reserved the task of\r\n  assessing the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be accorded\r\n  evidence.Â  Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.Â  On appeal, this court\r\n  determines whether the circuit court properly determined whether the commissionâ€™s\r\n  findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence in the record or whether\r\n  the commissionâ€™s decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Geathers v. 3V.\r\n    Inc., 371 S.C. 570, 576, 641 S.E.2d 29, 32 (2007).Â  Substantial evidence is\r\n  not a mere scintilla of evidence but rather is evidence which, considering the\r\n  record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that\r\n  the commission reached.Â  Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442; Rodney\r\n    v. Michelin Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 515, 519, 466 S.E.2d 357, 359 (1996).Â  The\r\n  mere possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does\r\n  not prevent the commissionâ€™s findings from being supported by substantial\r\n  evidence.Â  Grant v. S.C. Coastal Council, 319 S.C. 348, 353, 461 S.E.2d\r\n  388, 391 (1995).Â Â  Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nEmployer contends\r\n  the circuit court erred in reversing the decision of the commission because\r\n  substantial evidence existed to support the decision in full.Â  We reverse and\r\n  remand.Â   \r\nEmployer contends\r\n  the circuit erred in reversing the commissionâ€™s finding and conclusion that\r\n  Evans had not suffered compensable injuries to his left knee and foot as a\r\n  result of the fall.Â   \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, the circuit court found the commissionâ€™s decision was disproportionally\r\n  based on the fact the accident and emergency room reports did not mention left\r\n  sided symptoms and on the lack of evidence as to the left-sided injuries in the\r\n  reports of the authorized physicians.Â  The circuit court found no expert\r\n  medical evidence was offered to dispute Dr. Nealâ€™s testimony the left-sided\r\n  injuries â€œwere caused or at the very least aggravated by the work fall\r\n  and injuries.â€Â  The circuit court concluded,  \r\n\r\n\tthe\r\n  record is susceptible of but one reasonable inference, i.e. that the\r\n  injuries to [Evans] left lower extremity were compensable . . . the\r\n  Commissionâ€™s decision is unsupported where weight was given only to the opinion\r\n  of the authorized treating physicians yet those physicians made no mention of\r\n  [Evans] pre-existing conditions and left no opinion as to the effect of the\r\n  fall on those conditions or the effect of those conditions on the injuries\r\n  sustained in the fall.\r\n\r\nWe\r\n  find the commission considered all the medical evidence and other testimony in\r\n  finding Evans suffered no direct impairment of his lower left extremity or to\r\n  his feet as a result of the accident.Â  The commission considered not only the\r\n  accident report and hospital report from the day of the accident but also the\r\n  reports of the authorized physicians and Dr. Neal.Â  However, the commission\r\n  made no specific finding of fact concerning the issue of pre-existing\r\n  conditions and possible aggravation presented by Evans.Â  â€œUnder the Workersâ€™\r\n  Compensation Act, an injured claimant is entitled to compensation and medical\r\n  benefits for disability arising from a permanent physical impairment in\r\n  combination with a pre-existing impairment if the combined effect results in a\r\n  substantially greater disability.â€Â  Curiel v. Envtl. Mgmt. Servs., Op.\r\n  No. 26409 (S.C. Filed Dec. 20, 2007) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 43 at 40) (citing Ellison\r\n    v. Frigidaire Home Prods., 371 S.C. 159, 638 S.E.2d 664 (2006) (applying\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-400 (1985 &amp; Supp. 2005))).Â   \r\nThe\r\n  commission must make specific findings of fact upon which a claimantâ€™s right to\r\n  compensation is based.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§1-23-350 (2005); Shealy\r\n    v. Algernon Blair, Inc., 250 S.C. 106, 109, 156 S.E.2d 646, 648 (1967); 73A\r\n  C.J.S. Public Administrative Law and Procedure Â§274 (2007) (â€œWhere the\r\n  requirements as to administrative findings are contained in statutes, the\r\n  findings must comply therewith.â€)Â  An appellate court, reviewing an order of\r\n  the commission, â€œcannot make findings of fact when the commission has failed to\r\n  do so because, in doing so, [the] court would improperly assume the commissionâ€™s\r\n  role as factfinder.â€Â  Nettles v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. #7, 341 S.C.\r\n  580, 590, 535 S.E.2d 146, 151 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œIn reviewing a final decision of\r\n  an ALJ, as when reviewing a final decision of an agency, the circuit court\r\n  essentially sits as an appellate court to review alleged errors committed by\r\n  the ALJ.â€Â  Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 379, 527 S.E.2d 742, 755\r\n  (S.C. 2000). Â Because the commission did not make specific findings of fact concerning\r\n  the issue of aggravation, we cannot conduct a meaningful review and must reverse\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s finding of an aggravated compensable left-sided injury and remand\r\n  the issue to the commission.Â  See, e.g., Parsons v. Georgetown Steel,\r\n  318 S.C. 63, 456 S.E.2d 366 (1995) (holding an order of the commission that\r\n  does not include sufficiently detailed findings of fact must be remanded to the\r\n  commission) Â Â Â \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Employer contends the circuit court erred\r\n  in reversing the commissionâ€™s finding and conclusion that Evans reached MMI.Â  We\r\n  affirm.\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court held the commissionâ€™s decision to decide the issue of permanent\r\n  partial disability constituted a denial of due process.Â  The circuit court\r\n  found Evans specified in his Form 50 that he was â€œnot requesting a permanency\r\n  determination at this time.â€ Â The circuit court concluded Evans was entitled to\r\n  notice of issues to be decided and was entitled to have the commission\r\n  determine only those issues properly brought before it.Â  Â Â \r\nOn\r\n  appeal to this court, Employer asserts temporary benefits may be terminated\r\n  upon a showing of MMI, citing Smith v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Mental Health, 335\r\n  S.C. 396, 517 S.E.2d 694 (1999) and Anderson v. Baptist Medical Center and\r\n    Palmetto Hospital Trust Fund, 343 S.C. 487, 541 S.E.2d 526 (2001).Â  Thus,\r\n  because there was substantial evidence to support this finding, specifically\r\n  Dr. Noojinâ€™s report, Employer claims the circuit court erred in reversing the\r\n  finding of MMI.Â  However, Employer failed to appeal the circuit courtâ€™s finding\r\n  the commissionâ€™s decision on permanent partial disability constituted a denial\r\n  of Evansâ€™ due process.[4]Â \r\n  An unappealed ruling becomes the law of the case.Â  See Auto Owners\r\n    Ins. Co. v. Langford, 330 S.C. 578, 583 n.2, 500 S.E.2d 496, 498 n. 2 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1998) (noting trial courtâ€™s ruling on an issue becomes law of the case if\r\n  appellant fails to take exception to it both before the trial court and on\r\n  appeal).Â  Accordingly, we affirm the circuit courtâ€™s reversal and remand of the\r\n  commissionâ€™s finding of MMI.Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nOn\r\n  remand, we direct the commission to allow the parties to submit evidence and\r\n  fully develop the record as to aggravation of any pre-existing conditions, the\r\n  issue of permanent partial impairment and whether Evans has reached MMI.\r\nTherefore,\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s order reversing the findings and conclusions of the commission\r\n  are hereby\r\nREVERSED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART, AND REMANDED. \r\n\r\nHUFF and PIEPER, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Employerâ€™s Insurance Carrier, Guide One Insurance\r\n  Company, is also listed as an appellant to this action.\r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3] The\r\n  accident report does not indicate whether Evans injured his right or left\r\n  ankle.Â   \r\n[4] Similarly, on appeal, Evans did not present the\r\n  due process argument used by the circuit court.Â  Rather, Evans contends the\r\n  circuit court properly reversed the finding of MMI because he was never\r\n  provided treatment for his left lower extremity and thereby has not reached\r\n  MMI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-123","title":"Hess v.

Jackson, of Clinton, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  David\r\n  and Ceferina Hess (Appellants) appeal the circuit courtâ€™s granting of summary\r\n  judgment in favor of James Daniel and Janice Norton (collectively Heirs).Â  Appellants\r\n  contend the oral statements made to them at the time of the purchase together\r\n  with the subsequent sworn affidavit by Jane Crum are enough to support\r\n  Appellantsâ€™ claim of title to the twelve and one-half feet of the alleyway\r\n  located beyond the edge of their residence.Â  We affirm the circuit courtâ€™s grant\r\n  of summary judgment.\r\nFACTS\r\nThis matter arises from a property\r\n  boundary dispute in Greenwood, South Carolina.Â  Mack and Jane Crum\r\n  (collectively Crums) owned two parcels of land bordering Lawson Street.Â \r\n  Separating the two parcels in the rear of each is a twenty-five foot alleyway,\r\n  which runs perpendicular to and dead ends into Lawson Street, extending in the\r\n  opposite direction in a similar fashion between properties not subject to this\r\n  suit.Â  In 1984, the Crums brought an action seeking to close the alley to public\r\n  use, and transfer its ownership to the property owners.Â  In an order dated July\r\n  23, 1984, Judge James E. Moore ruled in favor of the Crums, finding â€œthis\r\n  street or alley [is] closed and that title to the twenty-five (25) foot width\r\n  thereof shall rest in the abutting property owners to the center line thereof,\r\n  that is, twelve and one-half (12.5) feet.â€Â  Significantly, the order referenced\r\n  a 1927 plat prepared by T.C. Anderson, which found Crumâ€™s residence on one side\r\n  of the alleyway encroached over the property line, and thus onto the alleyway,\r\n  by 7.2 feet.Â  Because the Crums owned the properties on either side of the\r\n  alleyway, title of the entire section of the alley between the two properties thereafter\r\n  rested with them.\r\nIn\r\n  1986, the Crums began renting the house located on one side of the alleyway to\r\n  Appellants.Â  During the rental period, Appellants used the alleyway as a\r\n  driveway to park their cars.Â  In May of 1988, Appellants purchased the same\r\n  rental property from the Crums.Â  Included in the deed was the title to the 12.5\r\n  feet or as much as would extend to the center line of the alleyway, and the\r\n  deed specifically referenced the 1984 order of Judge Moore.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Appellants admit their attorney examined the title to the subject property at\r\n  the time of the purchase, and that they were aware of the 1984 order.Â   \r\nThereafter,\r\n  the Crums indicated verbally, and Jane Crum committed to writing in an\r\n  affidavit, that the sale of the property to Appellants included half the\r\n  alleyway.Â  Further, it is uncontested that after the sale to Appellants, the\r\n  Crums verbally and demonstrably indicated the extent of the alleyway intended\r\n  to be included in the sale.Â  However, this oral indication was not memorialized\r\n  until Jane Crum executed an affidavit in 1999.Â  Ms. Crum later recanted the\r\n  affidavit, primarily because she admittedly had not seen the survey on record prior\r\n  to signing the affidavit which showed Appellantsâ€™ residence encroached over\r\n  their actual property boundary, 7.2 feet into the twenty-five foot alleyway.\r\nIn 1994, the Crums sold the remaining property located on the\r\n  other side of the alleyway to Russell Lawrence.Â  Although it is not included in\r\n  the record, testimony indicates Lawrence was given title to the other half of\r\n  the twenty-five foot alleyway.Â  Shortly after his purchase, Lawrence erected a\r\n  fence along the alleyway, and attempted to keep the Appellants off his\r\n  property.Â  A property line dispute ensued, and Lawrence ordered a survey of the\r\n  two lots by Eugene Adams, which revealed both that the alleyway was equally\r\n  divided, and that Appellantâ€™s house extended over the property line into the\r\n  alley.Â  The dispute between the two parties continued, and in 1999, Appellants\r\n  commissioned a second survey by Adams.Â  The second survey similarly showed the\r\n  divided alleyway, and an encroachment of 7.2 feet by the Appellantsâ€™ house into\r\n  the alleyway, which corroborated the 1927 plat referenced in Judge Mooreâ€™s\r\n  order.\r\nAs a result of the second survey, Appellants contacted Jane Crum\r\n  in an attempt to memorialize the above-mentioned oral indication of Appellantsâ€™\r\n  rights in the alleyway.Â  Ms. Crumâ€™s 1999 affidavit attests she and her husband\r\n  â€œexplicitly showed and pointed . . . the extent of the alleyway included in the\r\n  saleâ€ and references Judge Mooreâ€™s order for the proposition that the Crums had\r\n  legal title in the alleyway to transfer.Â  In June of 2001, Appellants filed a\r\n  complaint against Jane Crum, her husband being deceased, and Lawrence, seeking\r\n  to reclaim the portion of the alleyway to which they believed they were\r\n  entitled.Â  Pursuant to an agreement between the attorney for Lawrence and the attorney\r\n  for Appellants at the time, the complaint against Lawrence was dismissed with\r\n  prejudice on February 14, 2003.\r\nIt appears from the record that no request for a hearing was ever\r\n  made, and in June of 2003, Jane Crum passed away.Â  Appellants were subsequently\r\n  advised of Crumâ€™s death but appear not to have pursued the matter further.Â  On\r\n  November 28, 2005, the circuit court judge dismissed the action, but allowed\r\n  Appellants ninety days to substitute Crumâ€™s estate and personal representative\r\n  in her place.Â  On January 27, 2006, Appellants, now acting pro se,\r\n  filed a motion for a continuance, and a motion to substitute the Heirs as\r\n  defendants.Â  At a hearing a month later, Judge Howard P. King granted both the\r\n  motion for a thirty-day continuance, and the motion to substitute Crumâ€™s heirs\r\n  in her stead.Â   \r\nOn April 4, 2006, Appellants filed an amended complaint\r\n  substituting Heirs, as the children and surviving heirs of Crum, in addition to\r\n  Lawrence, as defendants to the complaint.Â  Thereafter, Lawrence made a Rule 12(b)(6),\r\n  SCRP, motion to dismiss based on res judicata, and Heirs made a Rule 56, SCRP,\r\n  motion for summary judgment.Â  Both motions were granted, and Appellants appeal\r\n  only the summary judgment motion in favor of Heirs.Â Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion,\r\n  this court applies the same standard of review as the trial court under Rule\r\n  56, SCRCP.Â  Cowburn v. Leventis, 366 S.C. 20, 30, 619 S.E2d 437, 443\r\n  (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Summary judgment is proper when there is no issue as to any\r\n  material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\r\n  law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Helms Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C.\r\n  334, 340, 611 S.E.2d 485, 488 (2005).Â  To determine whether any triable issues\r\n  of fact exist, the reviewing court must consider the evidence and all\r\n  reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Law\r\n    v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648 (2006).Â \r\n  When plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds\r\n  cannot differ, summary judgment should be granted.Â  Ellis v. Davidson,\r\n  358 S.C. 509, 518, 595 S.E.2d 817, 822 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nOn the other hand, summary judgment is not appropriate\r\n  where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the\r\n  application of the law.Â  Vermeer Carolinaâ€™s, Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Corp.,\r\n  336 S.C. 53, 59, 518 S.E.2d 301, 305 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  All ambiguities,\r\n  conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed most\r\n  strongly against the moving party.Â  Bayle v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 344\r\n  S.C. 115, 120, 542 S.E.2d 736, 738 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Even when there is no\r\n  dispute as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences\r\n  to be drawn from them, summary judgment should be denied.Â  See Hall\r\n    v. Fedor, 349 S.C. 169, 173-74, 561 S.E.2d 654, 656 (Ct. App. 2002).Â \r\n  Summary judgment is a drastic remedy; it should therefore be cautiously invoked\r\n  to prevent the improper deprivation of a trial of the disputed factual\r\n  issues.Â Â  Lanham v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, 349 S.C. 356, 363, 563\r\n  S.E.2d 331, 336 (2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants first\r\n  contend the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment on the basis that the\r\n  grant of use of the alleyway in perpetuity was not reduced to writing, as\r\n  required by the Statute of Frauds.Â  Appellants contend the written deed of sale\r\n  and Crumâ€™s 1999 affidavit referencing the twelve and one-half foot portion of\r\n  the alleyway created a genuine issue of material fact.Â  We disagree.  \r\nSection 27-35-20 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (1976) provides any agreement for the use or occupation\r\n  of real estate for more than one year shall be void unless in writing.Â  It is\r\n  established that Appellants received title to twelve and one-half feet of the\r\n  alleyway that ran behind their property when the Crums sold the property to\r\n  them in 1988.Â  However, it appears Appellants, deciding not to have the property\r\n  surveyed at the time of purchase, believed that the twelve and one-half feet\r\n  deeded to them began from the edge of their house and extended into the\r\n  alleyway.Â  As described above, Appellantsâ€™ deed referenced Judge Mooreâ€™s order,\r\n  in which then-petitioner Crum testified a portion of her residence encroached by\r\n  some 7.2 feet into the twenty-five foot alleyway.Â   \r\nAppellants contend\r\n  the Crums orally represented to them that they had title in perpetuity to\r\n  twelve and one-half feet, or to the center line, of the alleyway beginning at,\r\n  and extending from the edge of the residence.Â  However, we find the deed and\r\n  referenced plat to Appellants is clear that their title to the alleyway begins\r\n  at the previous property line, and thus encompasses the 7.2 feet occupied by\r\n  the residence.Â  Therefore, Appellantsâ€™ claim to the additional 7.2 feet of\r\n  alleyway is based on the Crumâ€™s oral representations.Â  Because the oral\r\n  agreement extending Appellantsâ€™ rights in the alleyway beyond the deed was made\r\n  for more than one year, and was not memorialized in writing, it violated\r\n  section 27-35-20. Â See Bruce v. Durney, 341 S.C. 563, 568, 534\r\n  S.E.2d 720, 723 (Ct. of App. 2000) (finding a written rental agreement that\r\n  allowed a tenancy to be created orally did not eliminate the need for a written\r\n  agreement in order for a tenancy of more than one year to be valid under the\r\n  Statute of Frauds).  \r\nAppellants further\r\n  maintain Jane Crumâ€™s 1999 affidavit satisfies the writing requirement of the\r\n  statute of frauds while supplementing the existing deed and previous oral\r\n  representations.Â  As a general rule, a memorandum may be made at any time\r\n  subsequent to the execution of a contract and prior to the bringing of an\r\n  action.Â  See Williston On Contracts, 4th Ed., Â§ 29:5 (2007); 72 Am. Jur.\r\n  2d Statute of Frauds Â§Â§ 210 to 213 (2007); 37 C.J.S. Frauds, Statute of Â§ 104\r\n  (2007).Â  While we acknowledge a proper memorandum evidencing an oral grant to\r\n  Appellants, beyond that which was included in the deed, would be enough to\r\n  satisfy the writing requirement in section 27-35-20, we find the 1999 affidavit\r\n  does not meet these requirements.Â  â€œ[A] writing must reasonably identify the\r\n  subject matter of the contract, sufficiently indicate a contract has been made\r\n  between the parties, and state with reasonable certainty the essential terms of\r\n  the agreement.â€Â  Player v. Chandler, 299 S.C. 101, 106, 382 S.E.2d 891,\r\n  895 (1989) (citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts Â§ 131 (1981)).Â   \r\nThe 1999 affidavit before\r\n  us appears to merely reiterate that the Crums showed and orally stated the extent\r\n  of the alleyway included in the sale, and that it was the same as described in\r\n  the survey plan, evidenced in the deed, and recorded in Judge Mooreâ€™s order.Â  It\r\n  does not purport to give Appellants any more than was sold to them under the\r\n  1986 deed.Â  As we decided above, the deed plainly gave Appellants only the\r\n  twelve and one-half feet of the alleyway from the edge of their property line,\r\n  and relies upon the order which takes note of the encroachment.Â  We therefore\r\n  find Ms. Crumâ€™s 1999 affidavit is insufficient to qualify as a memorandum in\r\n  support of the oral representation of any part of the alleyway in perpetuity\r\n  beyond that which was explicated in the deed.\r\nAppellants put\r\n  forth several additional arguments on appeal.[1]Â \r\n  We find these arguments are neither preserved nor ruled upon, nor relevant to\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s determination of summary judgment before us.Â  Because we\r\n  find the determination of the issue above to be dispositive in the appeal\r\n  before us, we need not review Appellantsâ€™ remaining contentions. Â need not review remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue\r\n  is dispositive of the appeal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we hold the circuit court did not err in\r\n  granting summary judgment.Â  The decision of the circuit court is accordingly\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE, J., and THOMAS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Appellants reference arguments submitted by Heirs in\r\n  their motion for summary judgment, but upon which the circuit court did not\r\n  rely in granting the motion.Â  These include:Â  (1) the action is not barred by\r\n  the statute of limitations; (2) the action is not frivolous or based on a claim\r\n  without merit; (3) that Heirsâ€™ contention the survey or plat of Lawrence be\r\n  made the basis of his ownership is untenable; (4) Heirs have a responsibility\r\n  to Appellants to oust Lawrence and BLT Properties as adverse possessors; and\r\n  (5) Heirsâ€™ contention Appellants have failed to prosecute the case is without\r\n  legal basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-124","title":"Anonymous Taxpayer v.

Â Â In 2000, the Department\r\n  of Revenue (the Department) conducted a sales and accommodations tax audit of\r\n  the taxpayerâ€™s businesses.Â  During the audit, the Department determined the taxpayer\r\n  sublet various properties for time periods less than ninety days and failed to\r\n  remit the applicable taxes on the proceeds of the rentals.Â  The Department\r\n  issued a proposed assessment to the sole-proprietorship in the amount of $13,093.41,\r\n  and to the corporation in the amount of $2,873.02.Â   \r\nThe taxpayer\r\n  requested a contested hearing before the Administrative Law Court (ALC). Â After\r\n  a hearing, the ALC upheld the Departmentâ€™s assessments.Â  The taxpayer did not\r\n  pay or post bond for the amount of tax and interest assessed by the Department.\r\n  Â Instead, the taxpayer appealed to the circuit court. Â The Department filed a\r\n  motion to dismiss.Â  By order of June 20, 2006, the circuit court granted the\r\n  Departmentâ€™s motion.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Failure\r\n  to Pay \r\nThe taxpayer argues the circuit court erred\r\n  in dismissing her appeal for failure to pay or post a bond for the amount of\r\n  tax and interest determined to be due by the ALC. Â Â We disagree.\r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina Code Section 12-60-3370 states â€œ[a] taxpayer shall pay, or post bond for, all taxes, not\r\n  including penalties or civil fines, determined to be due by the administrative\r\n  law judge before appealing the decision to the circuit court.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 12-60-3370 (Supp. 2005).Â  The term â€œtaxâ€ or â€œtaxesâ€ is defined to include\r\n  interest.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-30(27) (Supp. 2005).Â  A partyâ€™s failure to\r\n  comply with such procedural requirements for an appeal divests a court of\r\n  appellate jurisdiction.Â  State v. Brown, 358 S.C. 382, 387, 596 S.E.2d\r\n  39, 41 (2004).\r\nHere,\r\n  the amount due from the taxpayer is a â€œtaxâ€ as defined in the South Carolina\r\n  Revenue Procedures Act (the Act).Â  The Act defines â€œtaxâ€ or â€œtaxesâ€ as â€œtaxes, licenses, permits,\r\n  fees, or other amounts, including interest, regulatory and other penalties, and\r\n  civil fines, imposed by this title, or subject to assessment or collection by\r\n  the Department.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-30(27).Â  Section 12-36-920 imposes â€œa\r\n  sales tax equal to seven percent . . . on the gross proceeds derived from the\r\n  rental . . . for any rooms, . . . lodgings, or sleeping accommodations\r\n  furnished to transients.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-36-920.Â   \r\nAs stated above, taxpayer failed to pay the taxes\r\n  attributable to her sole proprietorship and corporation prior to filing her\r\n  appeal in the circuit court.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court properly dismissed\r\n  the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.\r\nII.&nbsp; Timeliness\r\nThe taxpayer further argues the circuit\r\n  court erred in dismissing her appeal as untimely.Â  Because we affirm the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s order on the failure to pay issue, we decline to address this\r\n  issue.Â  See Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v.

Shupe, Assistant\r\n  Attorney General R. Westmoreland Clarkson, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Kenneth Michael Outen appeals his\r\n  commitment to the South Carolina Department of Mental Health (the Department) as\r\n  a sexually violent predator. We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL / PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn 1987, Outen pled guilty in North Carolina to sexually\r\n  assaulting his thirteen-year-old stepdaughter. Â He was sentenced to four-and-one-half\r\n  years imprisonment.  \r\nIn\r\n  2001, Outen pled guilty in York County, South Carolina, to one count of a lewd\r\n  act on a minor.Â  Outen admitted he molested an eleven-year-old female whom he\r\n  babysat while her mother worked. Â Outen molested the child for three to four\r\n  years prior to the incident that led to his arrest.Â   \r\nPrior to Outenâ€™s scheduled release from prison,\r\n  his case was referred to the sexually violent predator multi-disciplinary team because\r\n  his conviction of lewd act on a minor is a qualifying offense under the\r\n  Sexually Violent Predator Act (SVP Act).Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  44-48-30(2)(k) (Supp. 2006).Â  The multi-disciplinary team reviewed Outenâ€™s\r\n  case, determined he satisfied the definition of a sexually violent predator,\r\n  and forwarded his case to the prosecutorâ€™s review committee. Â The prosecutorâ€™s\r\n  review committee agreed there was reason to believe Outen satisfied the\r\n  criteria for commitment under the SVP Act. Â The State then filed a\r\n  petition in circuit court to commit Outen to the Department for care and\r\n  treatment as a sexually violent predator. Â After a hearing, the circuit\r\n  court held probable cause existed to find Outen met the criteria for commitment\r\n  and ordered that Outen be evaluated pursuant to the SVP Act.  \r\nThe\r\n  matter was tried by a jury on October 11, 2005. Â Dr. Pamela Crawford\r\n  testified for the State. Â She opined Outen suffered from nonexclusive\r\n  pedophilia. Â Dr. Crawford defined pedophilia as a lifelong mental abnormality\r\n  that causes one to have repetitive thoughts, behaviors, or fantasies involving\r\n  sexual encounters with prepubescent children. Â She testified Outen has serious\r\n  difficulty controlling his impulses and added, â€œ[Outenâ€™s difficulty controlling\r\n  his impulses] is manifested by not simply [the fact] that he molested this one\r\n  child, . . . but also that he again, even after having been sentenced and [serving\r\n  time in] prison, . . . molested another child over a period of years.â€ Â Dr.\r\n  Crawford stated it was her medical opinion that there existed a likelihood\r\n  Outen would re-offend against young girls.Â  Â She concluded Outen met the\r\n  requirements to be considered a sexually violent predator.  \r\nAfter the state presented its case, Outen moved for a directed\r\n  verdict. Â The circuit court denied the motion, finding the state presented\r\n  evidence Outen met the criteria for commitment.Â   \r\nOuten then presented the testimony of Dr. Thomas Martin.Â  He had\r\n  conducted an independent evaluation of Outen.Â  Dr. Martin testified he\r\n  diagnosed Outen as a pedophile. Â He added the following factors increase\r\n  the likelihood Outen would re-offend: (1) he had more than one victim; (2) his\r\n  victims were similar ages; and (3) he molested the victims on multiple occasions. Â Dr. Martin, however, opined Outen does not need to be confined in a\r\n  secure facility for treatment. Â Instead, Dr. Martin stated Outen is â€œa\r\n  very good candidate for out-patient treatment.â€  \r\nAt the close of all the evidence, Outen renewed his motion for a\r\n  directed verdict.Â  The circuit court denied the motion, finding the State\r\n  offered sufficient evidence to submit the case to the jury.Â   \r\nThe jury unanimously found Outen was a sexually violent predator\r\n  under the SVP Act. Â Outen then moved for a judgment notwithstanding the\r\n  verdict or for a new trial. Â The circuit court denied the motion, and\r\n  ordered Outen committed to the Department of Mental Health.Â  Â Outen\r\n  appeals.\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nOuten argues the trial court erred in\r\n  denying his motion for a directed verdict because the State failed to present\r\n  evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that Outen met the statutory definition of a\r\n  sexually violent predator.Â  We disagree.\r\nOn an appeal from the trial courtâ€™s denial of a motion for a directed\r\n  verdict, the appellate court may only reverse the trial court if there is no\r\n  evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling. Â State v. Gaster, 349 S.C.\r\n  545, 555, 564 S.E.2d 87, 92 (2002).Â  In ruling on a directed verdict motion,\r\n  the trial court is concerned with the existence of evidence, not its weight. Â Id.Â  \r\n \r\nA sexually violent predator is defined in the SVP Act as â€œa person\r\n  who (a) has been convicted of a sexually violent offense; and (b) suffers from\r\n  a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to\r\n  engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility for\r\n  long-term control, care, and treatment.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(1) (Supp.\r\n  2006). Â â€œMental abnormalityâ€ is defined as â€œa mental condition affecting a\r\n  personâ€™s emotional or volitional capacity that predisposes the person to commit\r\n  sexually violent offenses.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(3).Â  The phrase â€œlikely\r\n  to engage in acts of sexual violenceâ€ is defined as a â€œpropensity to commit\r\n  acts of sexual violence . . . of such a degree as to pose a menace to the\r\n  health and safety of others.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(9).\r\nHere, Outen pled guilty to committing a lewd act on a child, a\r\n  sexually violent offense under the SVP Act.Â  See SC. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  44-48-30 (2)(k).Â  Also, the record shows evidence Outen suffers from a mental\r\n  abnormality or personality disorder, making him likely to engage in additional acts\r\n  of sexual violence.Â  Â As set forth above, Dr. Crawford testified Outen suffers\r\n  from pedophilia, which predisposes him to commit future acts of sexual\r\n  violence. Â Dr. Crawford opined Outen met the criteria for commitment under the\r\n  SVP Act. Â Also, Outenâ€™s expert, Dr. Martin, diagnosed Outen as a\r\n  pediphile in need of treatment. Â Accordingly, the trial court did not err in\r\n  denying Outenâ€™s motion for a directed verdict.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., PIEPER, J. and GOOLSBY, A.J.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-126","title":"Massey v.

Â The Masseys began leasing one of the trucks to Werner Enterprises in\r\n  2003. Â Werner subsequently hired the Masseys to drive the truck.  \r\nOn July 4, 2004, Massey sustained injuries when she slipped and fell\r\n  from her truck while on a route for Werner in Arizona. Â Massey subsequently filed\r\n  a workersâ€™ compensation claim against Werner and its carrier Liberty Insurance\r\n  Company (collectively Appellants) in South Carolina. Â Appellants denied the\r\n  claim, arguing Massey was an independent contractor and the South Carolina Workersâ€™\r\n  Compensation Commission (the commission) lacked jurisdiction.  \r\nAfter a hearing on October 6, 2005, the single commissioner found Massey suffered injuries\r\n  while hauling goods for Werner. Â The single commissioner further found\r\n  an employer-employee relationship existed between Werner and Massey. Â The single\r\n  commissioner held the commission had jurisdiction because Massey was hired and\r\n  employed in South Carolina. Â The single commissioner awarded Massey temporary\r\n  total disability benefits and causally related medical expenses. The single commissioner\r\n  awarded benefits based on an average weekly wage of $667.11.Â   \r\nAppellants appealed to the appellate panel. Â The appellate\r\n  panel affirmed the single commissionerâ€™s findings. Â Appellants then\r\n  sought judicial review in the circuit court. Â The circuit court affirmed the\r\n  order of the appellate panel on all issues. Â Appellants appeal.\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â Â Appellants argue the appellate panel erred in concluding\r\n  Massey was entitled to benefits because an employer-employee relationship did\r\n  not exist between Werner and Massey.[1]Â \r\n  In support of their assertion, Appellants heavily rely on the owner-operator\r\n  agreement Massey entered into with Werner, Masseyâ€™s declaration of employment\r\n  status as an independent contractor, and the Nebraska owner-operator workersâ€™\r\n  compensation coverage agreement signed by Massey.Â   \r\nAlthough the partiesâ€™ contract must be considered in determining\r\n  the nature of their relationship, the description of the relationship set forth\r\n  in the contract is not dispositive.Â  Kilgore Group, Inc. v. S.C. Employment\r\n    Sec. Commâ€™n., 313 S.C. 65, 68-69, 437 S.E.2d 48, 50 (1993).Â  Rather, the\r\n  test to determine whether an employer-employee relationship exists is if the\r\n  alleged employer has the right and authority to control and direct the\r\n  particular work or undertaking, as to the manner or means of its\r\n  accomplishment.Â  S.C. Workersâ€™ Comp, Commâ€™n v. Ray Covington Realtors, Inc.,\r\n  318 S.C. 546, 547, 459 S.E.2d 302, 303 (1995).Â  The following four factors are\r\n  evaluated to determine the right to control: (1) direct evidence of the right\r\n  or exercise of control; (2) method of payment; (3) furnishing of equipment; and\r\n  (4) right to fire.Â  Tharpe v. G.E. Moore Co., 254 S.C. 196, 200, 174\r\n  S.E.2d 397, 399 (1970).Â  Any single factor is sufficient proof of the\r\n  employment relationship; however, the absence of any one of the factors is at\r\n  most only mildly persuasive evidence of contractorship.Â  See Nelson\r\n    v. Yellow Cab Co., 349 S.C. 589, 594-95, 564 S.E.2d 110, 113 (2002); Wilkinson\r\n      v. Palmetto State Transp. Co., 371 S.C. 365, 373, 638 S.E.2d 109, 114 (Ct. App. 2006) cert. pending.Â  \r\n \r\nHere, direct evidence shows Werner had the right to control and\r\n  direct Masseyâ€™s work.Â  Although Massey owned the tractor, Werner did not allow Massey to drive the\r\n  truck for personal errands or for any other company. Â Moreover, Werner required Massey to affix Werner\r\n  logos on the truck and install a computer communication device in her truck.Â \r\n  Werner used the device to control Masseyâ€™s activities by tracking the location of the truck and instructing\r\n  Massey regarding the pick-up and delivery of loads. Â Werner required Massey to\r\n  use pre-approved fuel stops and service shops. Â This requirement directed\r\n  Masseyâ€™s route as Werner considered Massey off route if she failed to use the\r\n  pre-approved stops. Â Werner further required Massey to use a company credit\r\n  card for fuel and service charges, and these charges were deducted from Masseyâ€™s\r\n  pay.  \r\nWerner also furnished Masseyâ€™s equipment.Â  Werner leased the\r\n  tractor from Massey, supplied the trailer, and prohibited Massey from driving\r\n  the truck for any other company.Â  In addition, Werner provided permits, the logos\r\n  affixed to the tractor, and the computer communication device.Â  See Wilkinson, 371 S.C. at 374, 638 S.E.2d at 114\r\n  (stating employer supplied equipment where employer provided trailer, logos,\r\n  and a global positioning system).\r\nFinally, Werner asserted control over Masseyâ€™s work by maintaining\r\n  the authority to terminate Massey at any time.Â  See Tharpe, 254\r\n  S.C. at 201, 174 S.E.2d at 399 (stating the unconditional power to terminate\r\n  employment is consistent with an employer-employee relationship).Â  Massey\r\n  testified both she and Werner could terminate the agreement at any time without\r\n  penalty. Â Massey further testified Werner could terminate the\r\n  relationship if Massey took off more than four consecutive days.  \r\nThe foregoing factors all indicate an\r\n  employer-employee relationship existed between Werner and Massey.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we affirm the circuit courtâ€™s determination on this issue.\r\n2.Â Â Appellants next assert Massey is not entitled to benefits\r\n  in South Carolina because she received coverage under Nebraska law.Â  This\r\n  assertion is without merit.Â  Claimants who\r\n  accept workersâ€™ compensation benefits in another state are not precluded from\r\n  seeking additional benefits for which they are authorized to file in South Carolina. Â Holman v. Bulldog Trucking Co.&nbsp; 311 S.C. 341, 344, 428 S.E.2d\r\n  889, 891&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1993).Â  Furthermore, the Nebraska workersâ€™ compensation\r\n  coverage agreement does not operate to prohibit coverage in South Carolina.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-610 (2004) (stating no contract shall operate to relieve\r\n  an employer of any obligation created by the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act); S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-620 (Supp. 2006) (stating an agreement by an employee to waive\r\n  his rights under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act is void).  \r\n3.Â Â Appellants argue the appellate panel lacked jurisdiction\r\n  over Masseyâ€™s claim for benefits because Werner hired Massey in Georgia, Wernerâ€™s home office is located in Nebraska, and the injury occurred in Arizona.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nAn injured worker can file a claim under the laws of the state where\r\n  he is hired, he is injured, or his employment is located.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-10 (Supp. 2006).Â  Here, South Carolina is the state of\r\n  hire.Â  Massey accepted the position by telephone while in her home in South Carolina.Â  See Oâ€™Briant v. Daniel Constr. Co., 279 S.C. 254, 256, 305\r\n  S.E.2d 241, 243 (1983) (holding the existence of a contract establishes the\r\n  employer-employee relationship; where acceptance is given by telephone, the\r\n  place of contracting is where the acceptor speaks his acceptance).Â  In\r\n  addition, Masseyâ€™s employment was located in South Carolina.Â  Massey parked her\r\n  truck at her home in South Carolina when she was not driving.Â  See Holman,\r\n  311 S.C. at 346, 428 S.E.2d at 892 (stating employment is located in the state\r\n  of the employeeâ€™s base of operations); See also Hill v. Eagle\r\n    Motor Lines, 373 S.C. 422, 432, 645 S.E.2d 424, 429 (2007) (finding a truck\r\n  driverâ€™s base of operations was in South Carolina because he received work\r\n  assignments from his South Carolina home, started his road trips from his home,\r\n  kept his truck at his home on the weekends, and received his paycheck at home).Â \r\n  Furthermore, Massey testified Werner told her she would be based out of her\r\n  home because Werner does not have a South Carolina facility.Â   \r\n4.Â Â Appellants argue the appellate panel erred in determining\r\n  Masseyâ€™s weekly wage and compensation rate.Â  We find substantial evidence\r\n  supports the appellate panelâ€™s findings.\r\nA claimantâ€™s average weekly wage is generally calculated by\r\n  dividing the claimantâ€™s actual earnings in the four quarters prior to the\r\n  injury by fifty-two weeks.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-40 (Supp.\r\n  2006).Â  Where the claimant worked only a short period of time prior to the\r\n  injury, the wage can be calculated using the wage of a similarly situated\r\n  employee.Â  Id.Â  Where the wage cannot be calculated using either of the\r\n  foregoing methods, â€œsuch other method . . . may be resorted to as will most\r\n  nearly approximate the amount which the injured employee would be earning were\r\n  it not for the injury.â€Â  Id.Â  The purpose of the average weekly wage\r\n  statute is to â€œarrive at a fair approximation of the claimantâ€™s probable future\r\n  earning capacity.â€Â  Sellers v. Pinedale Residential Ctr., 350 S.C. 183,\r\n  191, 564 S.E.2d 694, 699 (Ct. App. 2002).Â   \r\nHere, the appellate panel was not able to compute Masseyâ€™s wages\r\n  using the two methods provided in the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act because Massey\r\n  worked for a short amount of time prior to her injury, and Werner did not\r\n  provide the commission with wage information.Â  Accordingly, the appellate panel\r\n  did not err in using statistical information for truck drivers in the Greenville area to approximate Masseyâ€™s weekly wage and compensation rate.Â  \r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF AND PIEPER, JJ. and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.Â \r\n\r\n[1]Â  Appellants also assert the appellate panel erred in\r\n  finding Werner is Masseyâ€™s statutory employer.Â  We decline to address this\r\n  issue because we find Werner was Masseyâ€™s direct employer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-127","title":"State v.

Nichols, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In\r\n  this breach of contract action, Lexington County Community Mental Health Center (the Center) appeals the grant of partial summary judgment to Witherspoon\r\n  Wilson Associates (the Lessor).Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Center, an outpatient facility of the\r\n  South Carolina Department of Mental Health (SCDMH), entered into a seven-year\r\n  lease (the Lease) with the Lessor, a developer and manager of commercial real\r\n  estate and investment property. The leased property was a commercial building\r\n  located in West Columbia, South Carolina.Â  The lease term was to commence March\r\n  1, 2001, and end on February 29, 2008.Â Â   \r\nDuring\r\n  the lease term, the Center entered into lease agreements with two additional lessors.Â  In July 2003, the Center entered into a lease, effective August 1,\r\n  2003, with Saluda Ridge, LLC for premises at 215 Palmetto Park, Lexington, South Carolina.Â  In September 2003, the Center entered into a lease, effective\r\n  September 1, 2003, with the Michael and Helen Masters Family Trust for premises\r\n  at 3965 Fish Hatchery Road, Gaston, South Carolina.Â  Over the next several\r\n  months the Center continued to pay the Lessor rent under the Lease, but began\r\n  moving various programs from the Lessorâ€™s building to property either owned by\r\n  the Center and SCDMH, or the recently leased properties at Palmetto Park and Fish Hatchery Road.Â  On February 20, 2004, Mr. Richard Acton, the Centerâ€™s\r\n  Executive Director, sent a letter to the Lessor giving notice that the Center\r\n  was cancelling the Lease pursuant to Paragraph 6(f).Â   \r\nParagraph 6 of the lease, entitled â€œLESSEE CANCELLATION,â€ contained\r\n  six provisions allowing the Center to cancel the Lease prior to the end of the\r\n  lease term.Â  Paragraph 6(f) provides:  \r\n\r\n\tAfter applicable written notice to Lessor, [the Center] may cancel\r\n  this lease without penalty, charge or further obligation:\r\n\t(f) after the first six (6) months from commencement date, by\r\n  giving one hundred twenty days written notice, provided that the OCCUPANT moves\r\n  into a building owned, leased or otherwise controlled by [the Center],\r\n  SCDMH or any other public agency or entity. \r\n\t(emphasis added)\r\n\r\nAfter providing notice of cancellation, the Center paid rent for\r\n  another 120 days, but thereafter ceased paying rent.Â  The Lessor brought an\r\n  action for breach of contract against the Center.Â  The master, sitting as a\r\n  special circuit judge, heard the matter upon a motion for partial summary\r\n  judgment filed by the Lessor.Â  The judge found the Centerâ€™s interpretation of\r\n  the cancellation provision â€œabsurd,â€ for under such a reading â€œthere would\r\n  literally be no circumstance under which [the Center] could not unilaterally\r\n  cancel the lease simply by moving out and renting any other space that it\r\n  preferred.â€ Â In making the determination, the judge applied contract\r\n  construction principles. As a further basis for the ruling, the judge found\r\n  Paragraph 6(f), at a minimum, was ambiguous â€œin its meaning or application.â€Â \r\n  Thus, the judge construed the clause against the Center, as the drafter of the\r\n  Lease, and granted partial summary judgment in favor of the Lessor.Â  This\r\n  appeal follows.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen\r\n  reviewing the grant of summary judgment, an appellate court applies the same\r\n  standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56, SCRCP: summary judgment is\r\n  proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving\r\n  party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Moore v. Weinberg,\r\n  373 S.C. 209, 215, 644 S.E.2d 740, 743 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  In determining whether\r\n  any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences\r\n  therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Osborne\r\n    v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).Â   \r\nSummary judgment is\r\n  appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\r\n  admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\r\n  genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to\r\n  judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56 (c), SCRCP;Â  Moore, 373 S.C. at\r\n  215, 644 S.E.2d at 743.Â  Summary judgment is not appropriate where further\r\n  inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of\r\n  the law.Â  Id.Â  Summary judgment is a drastic remedy that should be\r\n  cautiously invoked in order not to improperly deprive a litigant of a trial on\r\n  the disputed factual issues.Â  Murray v. Holnam, Inc., 344 S.C.\r\n  129, 138, 542 S.E.2d 743, 747 (Ct. App. 2001).Â   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe\r\n  Center contends summary judgment was improper because the court found the\r\n  cancellation provision under Paragraph 6(f) ambiguous.Â  Alternatively, the\r\n  Center argues if the cancellation provision under Paragraph 6(f) is not\r\n  ambiguous, summary judgment in favor of the Lessor was improper because the\r\n  Center did not breach the lease.  \r\nWhere\r\n  a motion for summary judgment presents a question as to the construction of a\r\n  written contract, if the language employed by the agreement is plain and\r\n  unambiguous, the question is one of law and can be properly disposed of at\r\n  summary judgment.Â  Hansen v. United Services Automobile Assoc., 350 S.C.\r\n  62, 67, 565 S.E.2d 114, 116 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  However, where the motion for\r\n  summary judgment presents a question as to the construction of a written\r\n  contract, and the contract is ambiguous because the intent of the parties\r\n  cannot be gathered from the four corners of the instrument, summary judgment is\r\n  improper.Â  Gilliland v. Elmwood Properties, 301 S.C. 295, 299, 391\r\n  S.E.2d 577, 579 (1990).Â  An ambiguous contract is a contract capable of being\r\n  understood in more than one way or a contract unclear in meaning because it\r\n  expresses its purpose in an indefinite manner.Â  Klutts Resort Realty, Inc.\r\n    v. Downâ€™Round Dev. Corp., 268 S.C. 80, 89, 232 S.E.2d 20, 25 (1977).Â  \r\n \r\nIn this case, on a motion for\r\n  summary judgment, the court found Paragraph 6(f) created an ambiguity â€œin its\r\n  meaning [and] application.â€Â  The court further found the\r\n  Centerâ€™s interpretation of the cancellation provision â€œabsurdâ€ and utilized\r\n  principles of contract construction to resolve the ambiguity instead of\r\n  proceeding to a hearing on the merits.Â  Where a contract is ambiguous and\r\n  capable of more than one construction, the matter is one to be determined by\r\n  the fact finder.Â  See e.g. HK New Plan Exchange Property Owner\r\n    I, LLC v. Coker, 375 S.C. 18, 23, 649 S.E.2d 181, 184 (Ct. App. 2007); Wheeler\r\n      v. Globe Rutgers Fire Ins. Co. of City of N.Y., 125 S.C. 320, 325, 118 S.E.\r\n  609, 610 (1923).Â  Therefore, we find the court improperly resolved the\r\n  ambiguity on summary judgment.[1]Â  In light of our disposition, we need not address the\r\n  Centerâ€™s remaining issue.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340-41, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (appellate\r\n  court need not address a remaining issue when resolution of prior issue is\r\n  dispositive).Â  Accordingly, the decision is  \r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.Â Â  \r\nHUFF and PIEPER,\r\n  JJ, and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] We note that it is possible for a court to reject an\r\n  absurd interpretation as a matter of law.Â  Holden v. Alice Mfg., Inc.,\r\n  317 S.C. 215, 221, 452 S.E.2d 628, 631 (Ct.

Shupe, all of Columbia; and Solicitor John\r\n  Gregory Hembree, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  A jury found Jimmy Owens, Jr. guilty of criminal\r\n  sexual conduct (CSC) with a minor in the first degree and lewd act on a minor.Â \r\n  The trial court sentenced Owens to thirty years for the CSC charge and fifteen\r\n  years for the lewd act to run consecutively.Â  Owens appeals the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  admission of evidence and qualification of an expert witness.Â  We affirm.\r\n1.Â Owens argues the\r\n  trial court erred in admitting a recorded phone call Owens made to his mother\r\n  while incarcerated.Â  At trial, counsel for Owens argued the tape recording was\r\n  prejudicial and did not constitute a statement against interest.Â  Rule 801\r\n  (d)(2), SCRE allows the admission of a statement offered against a\r\n  party if the statement is â€œthe partyâ€™s own statement in either an individual or\r\n  a representative capacity.â€Â  At the beginning of the phone\r\n  call, a recording alerted Owens the call is subject to monitoring and\r\n  recording; however, Owens still made admissions.Â  Owens said the State would\r\n  argue the victimâ€™s mother was at fault.Â  Owens stated, among other things, â€œ[b]ecause\r\n  she [victimâ€™s mother] knew what I were (sic) before I come in the house.Â \r\n  Therefore, she give (sic) me ample opportunity to mess with them kids.â€Â \r\n  Despite Owensâ€™s contention otherwise, this recording could be reasonably\r\n  construed as containing inculpatory evidence.Â  Therefore, the trial court did\r\n  not abuse its discretion.\r\n2.Â Owens contends the\r\n  trial court abused its discretion in certifying Cathie Coons, a forensic interviewer,\r\n  as an expert.Â  Coonsâ€™s extensive experience indicates no abuse of discretion\r\n  was made.Â  Coons received\r\n  certification from professional societies, conducted over 400 forensic\r\n  interviews, observed over 400 forensic interviews, attended training programs,\r\n  and testified multiple times in family court as an expert in forensic interviews.Â  See Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., 326 S.C. 248, 252-53,\r\n  487 S.E.2d 596, 598 (1997) (â€œ[A] witness must have acquired by reason of study\r\n  or experience or both such knowledge and skill in a profession or science that\r\n  he is better qualified than the jury to form an opinion on the particular\r\n  subject of his testimony.â€).Â  Additionally, Coonsâ€™s testimony regarding the victimâ€™s\r\n  interview was merely cumulative to the victimâ€™s testimony before the trial\r\n  court.\r\n3.Â Owens additionally\r\n  assigns error to the trial courtâ€™s sua sponte questioning of Coons,\r\n  while in the juryâ€™s presence, as to whether Coons believed the victim was\r\n  telling the truth.Â  Coons responded in the affirmative.Â  We decline to address\r\n  this issue because a contemporaneous objection was not made at trial.Â  See State v. Johnson, 363 S.C. 53, 58, 609 S.E.2d 520, 523 (2005) (requiring a\r\n  contemporaneous objection with specificity for the issue to be preserved).\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we affirm the trial courtâ€™s admittance of the recording and certification of Coons\r\n  as an expert.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-132","title":"Campagna v.

Calhoun, both of Columbia,\r\n  for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In\r\n  this personal injury action arising from a car accident in downtown Charleston,\r\n  Plaintiffs Joyce G. Campagna (Campagna) and Donald C. Campagna appeal the\r\n  verdict for Defendant George Flowers and the denial of their motion for a new\r\n  trial absolute, arguing the trial court improperly admitted DVD evidence\r\n  recorded several years after the incident.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn September 19, 2001, after leaving work\r\n  at 5:00 p.m., Campagna drove down Bee Street to the Lockwood Boulevard\r\n  intersection, stopped at a red light, looked both ways, and then successfully\r\n  made a right turn on red onto Lockwood Boulevard.Â  About the same time, Flowers\r\n  was approaching the Lockwood Boulevard intersection from the opposite direction\r\n  on an off-ramp from Highway 17.Â  He was stopped at the same red light across\r\n  the same intersection and, when the light changed to the green arrow, turned\r\n  left onto Lockwood Boulevard, thus preparing to travel in the same direction in\r\n  which Campagna was proceeding.Â  After both Campagna and Flowers completed their\r\n  turns, their vehicles collided.\r\nOn\r\n  December 23, 2003, Campagna filed this action against Flowers for injuries she\r\n  allegedly suffered from the accident.Â  Donald Campagna also sued for loss of\r\n  consortium.Â  Flowers timely answered the Campagnasâ€™ complaint, denying liability.Â \r\n \r\nThe\r\n  matter was tried before a jury from April 12 through April 14, 2006.Â  The\r\n  primary factual dispute in the matter was whether the collision occurred in the\r\n  curb lane or in the middle lane.[1]Â \r\n  Whereas Campagna contended Flowers improperly changed lanes and hit her vehicle\r\n  while she was traveling in the curb lane, Flowers maintained Campagna\r\n  improperly changed lanes and collided with his vehicle while he was driving in\r\n  the middle lane.Â   \r\nAt\r\n  trial, the Campagnas offered photographs taken a few days after the accident\r\n  showing all directions of the accident scene.Â  To combat this testimony,\r\n  Flowers offered a DVD of traffic moving in the intersection on October 26,\r\n  2006.Â  The Campagnas objected to this evidence, arguing (1) the DVD documented\r\n  the intersection more than four years after the accident; (2) the accident\r\n  scene was substantially different from what it had been at the time of the\r\n  accident; and (3) the DVD showed cars repeatedly making illegal turns similar\r\n  to what Flowers alleged Campagna had made.Â  Over these objections, the trial\r\n  court allowed the jury to view the DVD.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  jury returned a verdict for Flowers.Â  Following the denial of their post-trial\r\n  motions, the Campagnas filed this appeal.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œ[T]he admission or\r\n  exclusion of evidence in general is within the sound discretion of the trial\r\n  court.â€Â  Fields v. Regâ€™l Med. Ctr. of Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 25, 609\r\n  S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005).Â  â€œThe trial court has wide discretion in determining\r\n  the relevancy of evidence.â€Â  Wright v. Craft, 372 S.C. 1, 33, 640 S.E.2d\r\n  486, 503 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  For an appellate court to reverse a case based on\r\n  the erroneous admission or exclusion of evidence, the appealing party must show\r\n  prejudice.Â  Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 155-56, 485 S.E.2d 903,\r\n  911 (1997).Â   \r\nâ€œError\r\n  may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a\r\n  substantial right of the [complaining] party is affected.â€Â  Rule 103, SCRE.Â \r\n  For a substantial right to be affected, there must be â€œa reasonable probability the juryâ€™s verdict was influenced by\r\n  the challenged evidence or the lack thereof.â€Â  Fields, 363 S.C. at 26,\r\n  609 S.E.2d at 509.Â  â€œA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to\r\n  undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.â€Â  Johnson v. State,\r\n  325 S.C. 182, 186, 480 S.E.2d 733, 735 (1997).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  The Campagnas first argue\r\n  the DVD was not relevant because it â€œdid not make any fact more or less\r\n  probable.â€Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  DVD was admitted as demonstrative evidence and shown to the jury just before\r\n  the defense called the police officer who had responded to the accident.Â \r\n  Before it was played, the trial court explained to the jury that the purpose of\r\n  showing it was â€œjust so you can see and get a better feel and knowledge of the\r\n  intersection from various angles.â€Â  The court further cautioned the jury that\r\n  the DVD was not made on the day of the accident and the intersection had\r\n  changed since that time, but also noted the roadway itself was still\r\n  substantially the same.Â  The DVD had secondary relevance to the case and, when\r\n  considered with the officerâ€™s testimony, enabled the jury to understand the officerâ€™s\r\n  description of various roads in and around the intersection.Â  We therefore find\r\n  no abuse of discretion in the trial courtâ€™s decision to admit the DVD into\r\n  evidence.Â  See Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 383, 529 S.E.2d\r\n  528, 535 (2000) (noting demonstrative evidence â€œexplains or summarizes other\r\n  evidence and testimony,â€ â€œhas secondary relevance to the issues at hand,â€ and â€œis\r\n  not directly relevant, but must rely on other material testimony for relevanceâ€); Davis v. Traylor, 340 S.C. 150, 156-57, 530 S.E.2d 385, 388-89 (Ct. App.\r\n  2000) (noting an â€œabuse of discretionâ€ standard applies to a trial courtâ€™s\r\n  decision regarding both the exhibiting and admission of demonstrative\r\n  evidence).Â  The changes in the intersection between the time of the accident\r\n  and the recording of the DVD would at most have affected the weight of the\r\n  evidence, not its admissibility.\r\n2.Â  The Campagnas next argue\r\n  that admission of the DVD was unduly prejudicial, noting it showed numerous\r\n  vehicles making illegal turns similar to the turn that Flowers alleged Campagna\r\n  had made. Â The Campagnas contend the prejudice was exacerbated by the likelihood\r\n  that the vehicles depicted in the DVD were attempting to avoid striking a\r\n  curb-edged covered walkway that was admittedly not in place on the day of the\r\n  accident.Â  We find no error.Â  The DVD also depicted a number of vehicles\r\n  intruding or going into the far right lane while making the same left turn that\r\n  Flowers made from Highway 17 onto Lockwood Boulevard.Â  We therefore cannot say\r\n  the DVD favored either sideâ€™s version of how the accident occurred.Â   \r\n3.Â  We decline to address the\r\n  Campagnasâ€™ argument that the DVD was misleading because it did not contain a\r\n  continuous representation of the intersection of traffic patterns or their\r\n  allegation that, as evidenced by the constant changing of vantage points and\r\n  sporadic time stamps, it was edited to characterize Campagnaâ€™s conduct as\r\n  illegal.Â  We have found no indication in either the record or the briefs that\r\n  these concerns were raised at trial, and Campagnaâ€™s attorney indicated during\r\n  oral argument that they were first raised to the trial court during post-trial\r\n  motions; therefore, they were not raised in a timely manner and were not\r\n  preserved for appeal. Â See Hickman v. Hickman, 301 S.C. 455, 456,\r\n  392 S.E.2d 481, 482 (Ct. App. 1990) (â€œA party cannot\r\n  use Rule 59(e) to present to the court an issue the party could have raised prior\r\n  to judgment but did not.â€).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold\r\n  the Campagnas failed to show the trial court committed reversible error in\r\n  admitting the DVD evidence submitted by Flowers and are therefore not entitled\r\n  to a new trial absolute.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  As the Campagnasâ€™ attorney explained during opening\r\n  argument, the part of Lockwood Boulevard that both Campagna and Flowers entered\r\n  had three lanes.Â  Both Campagna and Flowers acknowledged the lane closest to\r\n  the center line was a left-turn only lane.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-133","title":"State v.

Fayssoux, both of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The\r\n  State appeals the circuit courtâ€™s reversal of Hungerfordâ€™s driving under the\r\n  influence (DUI) conviction arguing it was based on a ground not raised during\r\n  the trial before the magistrate court.Â  We affirm.[1]  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn the\r\n  early morning hours of October 7, 2001, Phillips Hungerford was returning home\r\n  after attending a wedding reception.Â Â  Russell Thompson, a State Trooper with\r\n  the South Carolina Highway Patrol, followed Hungerford as he drove through a\r\n  construction zone on Highway 291, a highway with three lanes of travel in each\r\n  direction.Â  Trooper Thompson noticed Hungerford having trouble â€œmaintaining his\r\n  laneâ€ of travel.Â  Initially, Trooper Thompson attributed Hungerfordâ€™s improper\r\n  driving to confusion in negotiating the construction zone.Â  Trooper Thompson\r\n  continued to follow Hungerford and observed him driving erratically after\r\n  leaving the construction zone.Â  This prompted Trooper Thompson to initiate a\r\n  traffic stop.Â  During the traffic stop, Trooper Thompson had Hungerford attempt\r\n  two field sobriety tests.Â  Hungerford failed both tests.Â  As a result,\r\n  Hungerford was placed under arrest for Driving Under the Influence.Â   \r\nOn September\r\n  22, 2005, Hungerford had a jury trial in magistrate court for the DUI offense. Â Prior\r\n  to jury selection, Hungerfordâ€™s attorney made a motion to exclude video footage\r\n  of his client, which had been made at the time of and following his arrest.Â \r\n  The video footage was contained on two tapes.Â  The first video tape begins with\r\n  Trooper Thompsonâ€™s initial questioning of Hungerford during the traffic stop\r\n  and continues until Trooper Thompson and Hungerford arrive at the county jail.Â \r\n \r\nThe second video tape, which was made at the county jail, shows\r\n  Trooper Thompsonâ€™s attempts at getting Hungerford to take a Datamaster/Breathalyzer\r\n  test.Â  At the beginning of the second video tape, Trooper Thompson advises\r\n  Hungerford of his Miranda[2] rights.Â  The second video tape includes Hungerford attempting to invoke his\r\n  right to counsel seventeen times.Â  Hungerford makes numerous statements which\r\n  are similar to â€œI am not refusing to take the test. I am saying I want to talk\r\n  to my attorney before I take the test.â€Â  Trooper Thompson interprets\r\n  Hungerfordâ€™s invocations as refusals to take the Datamaster/Breathalyzer test.Â \r\n  The video tape shows Trooper Thompson informing Hungerford he has refused to\r\n  take the test.Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nDuring the pre-trial motion hearing before the magistrate, Hungerfordâ€™s\r\n  attorney argued, inter alia, the footage should be excluded â€œas a\r\n  violation of [Hungerfordâ€™s] Fifth Amendment rights, and the Miranda warnings, and in particular the portion of the tape after the arrest.â€Â  The\r\n  magistrate ruled the tapes were admissible and replied to Hungerfordâ€™s\r\n  attorney: â€œI understand. Youâ€™re preserved well on the record, Counsel, and Iâ€™ll\r\n  be glad - - Iâ€™ll look forward to hearing from the appeals in this matter so\r\n  that we can get some better guidance.â€Â Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nTrooper Thompson was the first witness called during the trial.Â  At\r\n  the conclusion of his testimony, both video tapes were played for the jury. The\r\n  jury found Hungerford guilty.Â  Hungerford appealed his conviction to the\r\n  circuit court arguing, inter alia, his invocation of rights guaranteed\r\n  under Miranda, after being advised of a right to invoke said rights,\r\n  prohibited the introduction at trial of: 1) the fact that he invoked his right\r\n  to counsel; and 2) the fact that he refused to take the Datamaster/Breathalyzer\r\n  test based on the Stateâ€™s refusal to allow him to speak with counsel.[3]Â  Hungerford argued the fact that he\r\n  the invoked his Miranda rights, after being advised of said rights,\r\n  could not be used against a him at trial given the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s\r\n  holding in Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240 (1976).Â   \r\nThe State argued, inter alia, Hungerfordâ€™s issues on appeal\r\n  had not been raised below and, therefore, were not preserved for appeal.Â  The\r\n  State contended the arguments made during the motion hearing were limited to\r\n  the first video tape, Hungerfordâ€™s attorney had not mentioned Doyle during the proceedings before the magistrate, and Hungerfordâ€™s attorney failed\r\n  to make a contemporaneous objection to the second video tape when it was introduced\r\n  at trial.Â Â  Hungerfordâ€™s attorney countered that because Hungerford waived his\r\n  rights in the first video tape, the only Constitutional or Miranda issue\r\n  in the case was in the second video tape and, accordingly, the second video\r\n  tape was target for his objection.Â  Â Â \r\nAfter\r\n  considering the wording of Hungerfordâ€™s objection at the motion hearing, the\r\n  magistrateâ€™s assurance that Hungerfordâ€™s arguments were understood and preserved,\r\n  and the fact that the only Constitutional or Miranda issue in the case\r\n  was in the second video tape, the circuit court found Hungerfordâ€™s arguments\r\n  were preserved for appeal.Â  The circuit court reversed Hungerfordâ€™s conviction\r\n  and ordered the matter remanded for a new trial.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAppeals\r\n  from magistrate court convictions are made to the circuit court. S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 18-3-10 (Supp. 2006). The circuit court, acting as the appellate court,\r\n  reviews the matters raised in the notice of appeal. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-3-70\r\n  (Supp. 2006) (â€œThe appeal must be heard by the Court of Common Pleas upon the\r\n  grounds of exceptions made and upon the papers required under this chapter,\r\n  without the examination of witnesses....â€). â€œIn criminal appeals from\r\n  magistrate or municipal court, the circuit court does not conduct a de novo review, but instead reviews for preserved error raised to it by appropriate\r\n  exception.â€Â  State v. Henderson, 347 S.C. 455, 457, 556 S.E.2d 691, 692\r\n  (Ct. App. 2001). Â An issue is not preserved when one ground is raised to\r\n  the trial court and another ground is raised on appeal. State v. Freiburger,\r\n  366 S.C. 125, 134, 620 S.E.2d 737, 741 (2005).Â  â€œConstitutional issues, like\r\n  most others, must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be\r\n  preserved for appeal.â€ In re Care &amp; Treatment of Corley, 365 S.C.\r\n  252, 258, 616 S.E.2d 441, 444 (Ct. App. 2005). Â In\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only. State\r\n    v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe\r\n  State appeals arguing the circuit court reversed Hungerfordâ€™s conviction based\r\n  on a ground not raised in the magistrate court.[4] Â The State contends the\r\n  arguments during the motion hearing were limited to the first video tape,\r\n  Hungerfordâ€™s attorney did not mention Doyle during the proceedings\r\n  before the magistrate, and Hungerfordâ€™s attorney failed to make a\r\n  contemporaneous objection to the second video tape when it was introduced at\r\n  trial.Â   \r\nAfter\r\n  reviewing the transcript from the magistrate court, we find the issues relied\r\n  on by the circuit court were preserved for appellate review.Â  â€œA party need not\r\n  use the exact name of a legal doctrine in order to preserve it, but it must be\r\n  clear that the argument has been presented on that ground.â€Â  State v. Dunbar,&nbsp;356\r\n  S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 694&nbsp;(2003).Â  In order to preserve for\r\n  review an alleged error in admitting evidence an objection should be\r\n  sufficiently specific to bring into focus the precise nature of the alleged\r\n  error so it can be reasonably understood by the trial judge.Â  State v. Prioleau,\r\n  345 S.C. 404, 411, 548 S.E.2d 213, 216&nbsp;(2001).Â   \r\nHungerfordâ€™s\r\n  attorney specifically stated that he had an additional objection based on a\r\n  violation of his clientâ€™s â€œFifth\r\n  Amendment rights, and the Miranda warnings, and in particular the\r\n  portion of the tape after the arrest.â€ Â In\r\n  response, the magistrate assured him that his objection was understood and he\r\n  was â€œpreserved well on the record.â€Â Â Â  We, as an appellate court, are not in a\r\n  position to second guess the understanding of the magistrate.Â  Additionally, there\r\n  was no need for a contemporaneous objection because the video tapes were\r\n  admitted immediately following the motion hearing.Â  See State v.\r\n    Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 642, 541 S.E.2d 837, 840&nbsp;(2001) (â€œWhere a\r\n  judge makes a ruling on the admission of evidence on the record immediately\r\n  prior to the introduction of the evidence in question, the aggrieved party does\r\n  not need to renew the objection.â€).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated above, the order of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nANDERSON, SHORT, and THOMAS JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.  \r\n[2] Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602 (1966).\r\n[3] Hungerford has not argued he had a right to meet with\r\n  or speak with counsel prior to taking the Datamaster/Breathalyzer test.Â \r\n \r\n[4] This preservation argument is the only issue argued\r\n  by the State on appeal.Â  Accordingly, we are not reviewing the underlying\r\n  merits of the circuit courtâ€™s reversal.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-134","title":"Irby v.
