Krize, of Florence, Guardian Ad\r\n          Litem. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Adam C. (Father) appeals the family court's final order terminating his\r\n  parental rights to his minor child (Child).Â  On appeal, Father contends the family court erred in finding (1) he willfully failed to support\r\n  and visit Child and (2) termination of parental rights (TPR) was in Child's best\r\n  interests.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nThe grounds for TPR must be\r\n  proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v.\r\n    Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  &quot;Upon\r\n  review, the appellate court may make its own finding from the record as to\r\n  whether clear and convincing evidence supports [TPR].&quot;Â  S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Soc. Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 609, 582 S.E.2d 419, 423 (2003).Â \r\n  However, despite our broad scope of review, we are not required to disregard\r\n  the findings of &quot;the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses, [and]\r\n  was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative\r\n  weight to their testimony.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The family court may order TPR upon finding one or more of eleven\r\n  statutory grounds is satisfied and also finding TPR is in the best interest of\r\n  the child.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570 (2010).Â  \r\nWe find clear and\r\n  convincing evidence supports the family court's finding Father willfully failed\r\n  to support Child.[2]Â \r\n  Â Father did not contribute any child support while imprisoned, nor did he\r\n  contribute to Child's care despite having the ability to do so when he was not\r\n  incarcerated.Â  Margaret B. (Mother) testified she did not receive any child\r\n  support from Father.Â  Additionally, Father admitted he did not make any direct\r\n  financial contributions for Child.Â  Furthermore, although Father attempted to\r\n  establish his mother (Grandmother) was contributing for Child's care on his\r\n  behalf, the family court's finding that Grandmother provided items to Child on\r\n  her own behalf without Father's participation is supported by clear and convincing\r\n  evidence.Â  Grandmother's testimony at the TPR hearing indicated she, not\r\n  Father, provided items to Child on her own behalf.Â  Moreover, the guardian ad\r\n  litem (GAL) stated Father's efforts towards Child were minimal and it appeared Grandmother\r\n  was the &quot;driving force&quot; behind the relationship.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570(4) (2010) (stating one statutory ground for TPR is met\r\n  when the child has lived outside of the home of either parent for a period of\r\n  six months, and during that time the parent has willfully failed to support the\r\n  child).Â  \r\nIn a TPR case, the best\r\n  interests of the child are the paramount consideration.Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs.\r\n    v. Smith, 343 S.C. 129, 133, 538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  &quot;The interests of the child shall prevail if the child's\r\n  interest and the parental rights conflict.&quot; Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2620\r\n  (2010).Â  \r\nWe find clear and convincing\r\n  evidence in the record supports the family court's finding that termination of Father's\r\n  parental rights was in Child's best interests.Â  Father has a long history of\r\n  abusing drugs and criminal behavior stemming from his drug addiction.Â \r\n  Additionally, Father admitted he suffers from bipolar depression and acted\r\n  violently in the past because of his mental illness.Â  In contrast, Mother and\r\n  her current boyfriend are providing a stable and loving environment for Child,\r\n  and the GAL stated Child was well-adjusted in her current home and interacted\r\n  well with both Mother and Mother's current boyfriend.Â  Additionally, Mother's\r\n  boyfriend testified he wanted to adopt Child, and terminating Father's parental\r\n  rights would allow the adoption process to proceed.[3]Â \r\n  Accordingly, the family court correctly determined TPR was in Child's best\r\n  interests.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  THOMAS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Because we find Father willfully failed to support Child,\r\n  we need not address Father's failure to visit Child.Â  See Stinecipher\r\n    v. Ballington, 366 S.C. 92, 100 n.6, 620 S.E.2d 93, 98 n.6 (Ct. App. 2005)\r\n  (stating once one statutory ground is met, this court need not address whether\r\n  any other ground for TPR has been proved).Â  \r\n[3] See Doe v. Roe, 386 S.C. 624, ___, 690\r\n  S.E.2d 573, 579 (2010) (&quot;Overturning the family court's decision to terminate\r\n  Father's rights clearly conflicts with the TPR statute's purpose to make a\r\n  child eligible for adoption by someone 'who will provide a suitable home\r\n  environment and the love and care necessary for a happy, healthful, and\r\n  productive life.'&quot;) (quoting S.C.

Howle, Jr., of Darlington, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n        James Gladney McGee, III, of Florence, for\r\n          Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Shawn W. (Father) appeals the termination of parental rights (TPR) to his minor\r\n  children.Â  The family court terminated Father's parental rights pursuant to\r\n  section 63-7-2570(3) (willful failure to visit), (4) (willful failure to\r\n  support), and (8) (in foster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two\r\n  months) of the South Carolina Code (2010).Â  Additionally, the family court\r\n  found TPR was in children's best interests.Â  On appeal, Father argues the\r\n  family court erred in finding TPR was in children's best interests when an adoptive\r\n  home had not been identified.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nThe family court may order TPR upon a finding of one or more delineated grounds and a\r\n  finding that termination is in the best interest\r\n  of the child.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570.Â  The purpose of the TPR statutes are:\r\n\r\n  Â [T]o establish\r\n    procedures for the reasonable and compassionate termination of parental rights\r\n    where children are abused, neglected, or abandoned in order to protect the\r\n    health and welfare of these children and make them eligible for adoption by\r\n    persons who will provide a suitable home environment and the love and care\r\n    necessary for a happy, healthful, and productive life.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. &sect; 63-7-2510 (2010).\r\nMoreover, the TPR statutes\r\n  &quot;must be liberally construed in order to ensure prompt judicial procedures\r\n  for freeing minor children from the custody and control\r\n  of their parents by terminating the parent-child relationship.Â  The interests of the child shall prevail if the child's interest and the parental rights conflict.&quot; S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 63-7-2620 (2010); see also Joiner v. Rivas, 342\r\n  S.C. 102, 536 S.E.2d 372 (2000) (overruling prior cases calling for strict\r\n  construction of the TPR statutes).Â  Thus, the best interest of the child is the\r\n  paramount consideration.Â  Charleston County Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Jackson,\r\n  368 S.C. 87, 102, 627 S.E.2d 765, 774&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).\r\n\r\nFather does not allege error\r\n  in the family court's finding statutory grounds for TPR existed.Â  Rather,\r\n  Father admitted he only visited children one time after removal and did not\r\n  financially support children.Â  Thus, the dispositive issue is whether terminating\r\n  Father's parental rights is in children's best interests.Â  Father's\r\n  behavior as it relates to the statutory grounds for termination can be\r\n  considered in determining best interests.Â  See Doe v. Roe, 386\r\n  S.C. 624, ___, 690 S.E.2d 573, 578&nbsp;(2010) (explaining a parent's behavior &quot;as\r\n  it relates to the statutory grounds for termination is appropriately reviewed\r\n  for purposes of the best interest analysis because such conduct evinces a\r\n  settled purpose to forego parental duties&quot;).Â  By Father's own admissions, he was not\r\n  involved with children &quot;except in\r\n  very superficial ways and even then on an extremely sporadic basis.&quot;Â \r\n  Further, Father admitted he did not support children and had only visited\r\n  children one time since their removal from their mother's home on May 19, 2005.Â \r\n  Further, Department of Social Services foster care supervisor Martha Stackhouse\r\n  testified she believed TPR was in children's best interests.Â  Thus, the\r\n  termination of Father's parental rights does not conflict with the purpose of\r\n  the TPR statutes to make children eligible for adoption by someone &quot;who\r\n  will provide a suitable home environment and the love and care necessary for a\r\n  happy, healthful, and productive life.&quot;Â  Â§ 63-7-2510.\r\nAccordingly, the family\r\n  court's order is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  THOMAS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-271","title":"City of Columba v.

Busbee, of Wagner, for\r\n          Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Following\r\n  Stacey E.'s (Mother's) divorce from Richard E. (Father), Mother filed a\r\n  termination of parental rights (TPR) action against Father alleging he (1)\r\n  failed to visit D.E. (Child) and (2) failed to support Child.Â  Following a\r\n  hearing, the family court issued an order refusing Mother's request to\r\n  terminate Father's parental rights, which Mother now appeals.Â  Mother also asserts\r\n  the family court erred in instructing the guardian ad litem (GAL) to establish\r\n  a visitation schedule.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.[1]Â Â Â Â  \r\n1.Â  We affirm the family\r\n  court's finding Father did not willfully fail to support Child pursuant to\r\n  section 63-7-2570(4) of the South Carolina Code (2010).Â  See S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Seegars, 367 S.C. 623, 630, 627 S.E.2d 718, 721\r\n  (2006) (explaining that whether a parent's failure to support a child is\r\n  &quot;willful&quot; within the meaning of the statute is a question of intent\r\n  to be determined in each case\r\n  from all the facts and circumstances); Id. at 630, 627 S.E.2d at 721-22\r\n  (explaining conduct of a parent that &quot;evinces a settled purpose to forego\r\n  parental duties may fairly be characterized as willful because it manifests a\r\n  conscious indifference to the rights of the child to receive support and\r\n  consortium from the parent&quot;).\r\n2.Â  We affirm the family\r\n  court's finding Father did not willfully fail to visit Child pursuant to\r\n  section 63-7-2570(3) because evidence established Father attempted to visit\r\n  Child.Â  See Â§ 63-7-2570(3) (&quot;The child has lived outside the home\r\n  of either parent for a period of six months, and during that time the parent\r\n  has wil[l]fully failed to visit the child.Â  The court may attach little or no\r\n  weight to incidental visitations, but it must be shown that the parent was not\r\n  prevented from visiting by the party having custody or by court order.Â  The\r\n  distance of the child's placement from the parent's home must be taken into\r\n  consideration when determining the ability to visit.&quot;).[2]\r\n3.Â  We reverse the portion of\r\n  the family court's order instructing the GAL to develop a visitation schedule,\r\n  and we remand this issue to the family court for it to establish visitation.Â  See Stefan v. Stefan, 320 S.C. 419, 422, 465 S.E.2d 734, 736&nbsp;(Ct. App.\r\n  1995) (holding the family court, not the GAL, is charged with the authority and\r\n  responsibility for protecting the interest of minors involved in litigation); Id. (explaining the family court is responsible for establishing visitation and it\r\n  should not delegate that responsibility to the GAL).\r\n4.Â  We modify the family\r\n  court's order regarding child support.Â  The family court's order required\r\n  Father to pay $60.00 in weekly child support; however, the child support\r\n  calculation sheet indicates Father is required to pay $60.90 in weekly child\r\n  support.Â  Accordingly, we find the order should reflect Father is required to\r\n  pay $60.90 in weekly child support.Â  See Mr. T v. Ms. T,&nbsp;\r\n  378 S.C. 127, 132, 662 S.E.2d 413, 416&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2008) (&quot;[W]here the interests of\r\n  minors or incompetents are involved, [p]rocedural rules\r\n  are subservient to the court's duty to zealously guard\r\n  the rights of minors.Â  Where the rights and best interests of a minor child are concerned, the court may appropriately raise, ex mero motu, issues not raised\r\n  by the parties.&quot;) (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, MODIFIED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED. \r\nKONDUROS, GEATHERS, and\r\n  LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case\r\n  without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Due to our disposition of Mother's first two issues\r\n  on appeal, we need not address the issue of whether TPR was in Child's best\r\n  interest.

Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(B) (Supp. 2009) (stating the court\r\n  of appeals may reverse or modify the ALC's decision if &quot;substantive rights\r\n  of the petitioner have been prejudiced&quot;); S.C.

Code Ann. Â§ 19-11-90 (1985) (prohibiting the\r\n  disclosure of any confidential communication with a clergyman only when it is properly entrusted to him in his professional capacity and\r\n  necessary and proper to enable him to discharge the functions of his office\r\n  according to the usual course of practice or discipline of his church or\r\n  religious body); State v.

DiMarco, of Greenville, for\r\n          Appellant.\r\n        Kim Varner, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Brian A. DiMarco (Husband) appeals the\r\n  family court's order finding him in contempt, arguing the court erred in holding him in criminal\r\n  contempt without his attorney present and a jury trial. We affirm as modified.[1]Â  Â \r\nIn June 2008,\r\n  Husband was ordered before the family court on a rule to show cause for\r\n  noncompliance with a prior support order.Â  Two days prior to the hearing, Husband\r\n  paid the outstanding balance on his support obligation.Â  At the hearing, the\r\n  family court noted Husband was in compliance with the support order, but found\r\n  him in contempt.Â  The court stated, &quot;The\r\n  sentence is going to be 12 months, it'll be civil contempt I will suspend that\r\n  he is to have a $250.00 court cost that'll be due by July 11th. We'll let him\r\n  out of detention at this point in time.&quot;\r\nHere, the family\r\n  court's contempt sanction has elements of both civil and criminal contempt.Â \r\n  The sanction is civil in that the jail sentence will not be imposed unless and\r\n  until Husband fails to pay the $250 in court costs.Â  See Poston v. Poston, 331 S.C. 106, 112, 502 S.E.2d 86, 89&nbsp;(1998) (noting the\r\n  &quot;conditional nature of [a] punishment renders the relief civil in nature\r\n  because the contemnor can end the sentence and discharge himself at any moment\r\n  by&quot; complying the court's order).Â  On the other hand, the sanction is criminal in that if Husband\r\n  fails to pay the $250 in court costs he will go to jail for a definite period\r\n  of time.Â  See id. at 111-12, 502 S.E.2d at 89 (noting contempt is\r\n  criminal &quot;[i]f the relief provided\r\n  is a sentence of imprisonment, .\r\n  . . [and] the sentence is limited to imprisonment for a definite period&quot;).Â \r\n  However, during the hearing the family court indicated several times it\r\n  intended to hold Husband in civil contempt.Â  Further, in stating the sanction\r\n  the family court indicated it was civil contempt.Â  We find the family court\r\n  intended to hold Husband in civil contempt but inadvertently stated the\r\n  sanction unclearly.Â  Therefore, we modify the family court's sanction to impose\r\n  a one-year sentence that Husband may purge by payment of $250 in court costs,\r\n  thus releasing himself from confinement.Â  Husband shall have fifteen days from\r\n  the filing of this opinion to pay the $250 in court costs before the one-year\r\n  sentence commences.Â  For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the family\r\n  court isÂ  \r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nHUFF,\r\n  THOMAS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-290","title":"State v.

Crabtree appeals his conviction for third-degree burglary, arguing the trial\r\n  court erred in: (1) denying his motion to relieve counsel and (2) failing to\r\n  properly advise him regarding his right to self-representation.Â  We affirm.[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n1.Â  As to whether the trial\r\n  court erred in denying Crabtree's motion to relieve counsel:Â  The trial court\r\n  conducted a thorough investigation into the basis of Crabtree's complaints\r\n  against his trial counsel.Â  Although Crabtree certainly expressed disagreement\r\n  with his trial counsel's strategies and prospective defenses to the crime, none\r\n  of his objections prevented him from communicating with his attorney or\r\n  precluded trial counsel from preparing a zealous defense for him.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Crabtree's motion to\r\n  relieve counsel.Â  See State v. Childers, 373 S.C. 367, 372, 645\r\n  S.E.2d 233, 235 (2007) (&quot;A motion to relieve counsel is addressed to the\r\n  discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion.&quot;); State v. Sims, 304 S.C. 409, 414, 405 S.E.2d 377,\r\n  380 (1991) (holding an appellate court may consider several factors in\r\n  determining whether the trial court abused its discretion in a motion for\r\n  substitution of counsel: timeliness of the motion, adequacy of the trial\r\n  judge's inquiry into the defendant's complaint, and whether the attorney-client\r\n  conflict was so great that it resulted in a total lack of communication,\r\n  thereby preventing an adequate defense).Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n2.Â  As to whether the trial\r\n  court erred in failing to properly advise Crabtree regarding his right to\r\n  self-representation:Â  Here, a review of the record indicates Crabtree did not\r\n  request to proceed pro se at any time during his trial.Â  Therefore, the trial\r\n  court did not err in failing to advise Crabtree regarding his right to\r\n  self-representation because it was not required to inform Crabtree of the\r\n  dangers and disadvantages of self-representation until Crabtree clearly\r\n  requested to proceed pro se.Â  See State v. Fuller, 337 S.C. 236, 241,\r\n  523 S.E.2d 168, 170 (1999) (&quot;A defendant's right to waive the assistance\r\n  of counsel is not unlimited.

Patterson appeals the Administrative Law Court's (ALC) affirmance of the\r\n  Department of Correction's (the Department) denial of Patterson's grievance.Â  We affirm.[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nPatterson argues the ALC\r\n  erred in finding his grievance was not timely filed.Â  We disagree.Â  The\r\n  Department denied Patterson's grievance based on SCDC Policy Number GA-01.12 Â¶\r\n  13.1, which states an inmate must file a grievance within fifteen days of the\r\n  alleged incident.Â  Here, Patterson filed his grievance complaining of loss of his\r\n  inmate property on December 4, 2006.Â  Even if we construed the requirements for\r\n  filing liberally in Patterson's favor, Patterson should have filed his\r\n  grievance within fifteen days of December 6, 2004, when he originally\r\n  discovered that the Department lost his inmate property.Â  However, he did not\r\n  file his grievance until almost two years later.Â  The ALC did not err in\r\n  relying on the Department's internal policy in finding Patterson failed to\r\n  timely file his grievance because &quot;[t]he adoption and execution of\r\n  policies and practices necessary to preserve internal order and discipline, and\r\n  to maintain institutional security in the prison are within the province and\r\n  expertise of correctional officials.&quot;Â  State v. Blick, 325 S.C.\r\n  636, 642, 481 S.E.2d 452, 455 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Accordingly, the ALC did not\r\n  err in affirming the denial of Patterson's grievance.Â  See S.C. Dep't\r\n    of Corr. v.
