Clark, and, Morris D. Rosen, both of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nPeter L. Fuge, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Richard W. Bowen (Husband) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s inclusion of post-judgment interest in its determination of the amount Husband owed to Ann B. Bowen (Wife) for the sale of four jointly-titled properties.Â  The circuit court enforced its previous order, awarding Wife a one-half interest in the proceeds from the sale plus post-judgment interest.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nThe parties married in 1985.Â  Prior to the marriage, the parties entered into an antenuptial agreement.Â  The agreement provided that all property owned prior to or accumulated during the marriage would remain each partyâ€™s separate, non-marital property.Â  During the marriage, Husband acquired four parcels of property and titled each parcel in the names of Husband and Wife.Â  In 1992, Wife commenced a divorce action against Husband and sought equitable distribution of the four jointly titled parcels.Â  The family court, pursuant to the antenuptial agreement, found the properties were non-marital in nature, but awarded each an undivided one-half interest in the properties.Â  \r\nOn appeal, this court vacated the portion of the family courtâ€™s order addressing the partiesâ€™ interests in the four parcels of property, holding the family court lacks jurisdiction to determine ownership of non-marital property.Â  Bowen v. Bowen, 327 S.C. 561, 566, 490 S.E.2d 271, 273 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Thereafter, Wife filed a declaratory judgment action.Â  By order dated March 19, 1999, the circuit court found Husband gifted Wife an undivided one-half interest in the four parcels of property.Â  Because the properties were sold during the pendency of the appeal and all funds were held in escrow, the circuit court awarded Wife one-half of the proceeds from the sale.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court ruled that â€œ[Wife] is entitled to immediate payment of the same [proceeds] plus interest at the legal rate accruing from the date of each deedâ€ and ordered that â€œEach party owing money to the other shall pay to such other 8 3/4 % interest on such money from the time the other was entitled to it until it is paid.â€Â  \r\nHusband appealed arguing he did not intend to make a gift of the properties to Wife and the usual presumption of a gift from a husband to a wife did not apply when the parties had entered into a valid antenuptial agreement.Â  Thus, he argued the circuit court should have imposed a resulting trust on the proceeds from the sale.Â  Bowen v. Bowen, 345 S.C. 243, 249, 547 S.E.2d 877, 880 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  We disagreed and affirmed the circuit courtâ€™s order.Â  Id. at 251, 547 S.E.2d at 881.Â  Subsequently, Husband appealed to the supreme court which held: â€œthe Court of Appeals properly affirmed the Masterâ€™s findings that Wife owned an undivided one-half interest in the four properties.â€Â  Bowen v. Bowen, 352 S.C. 494, 556, 575 S.E.2d 553, 556 (2003).Â  The supreme court then sent the remittitur to the circuit court.Â  \r\nThereafter, Wife filed a rule to show cause for contempt and requested that the court calculate all sums due her plus interest and order Husband to pay such sums immediately.Â  The circuit court calculated the total Husband owed to Wife, including interest, and ordered Husband to pay.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHusband argues the circuit court erred by including post-judgment interest in its calculation of the total amount Husband owed to Wife.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA portion of a judgment that is not appealed presents no issue for determination by the reviewing court and constitutes, rightly or wrongly, the law of the case.â€Â  Austin v. Specialty Transp. Servs., 358 S.C. 298, 320, 594 S.E.2d 867, 878 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  It is a fundamental rule of law that an appellate court will affirm a ruling by a trial court if the offended party does not challenge that ruling.Â  Biales v. Young, 315 S.C. 166, 168, 432 S.E.2d 482, 484 (1993).Â  Failure to challenge the ruling â€œis an abandonment of the issue and precludes consideration on appeal.â€Â  Id. at 168, 432 S.E.2d at 484. \r\nPursuant to the order dated March 19, 1999, in calculating the total sum Husband owed to Wife from the sale of the four properties, the circuit court included interest at the rate of 8 3/4 %.Â  Husband contends Wife had no right to interest because funds held in escrow do not constitute a money judgment that accrues interest pursuant to Section 34-31-20 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004).Â  However, Husband did not raise this issue when he appealed the circuit courtâ€™s March 19, 1999 judgment.Â  Our supreme court affirmed the circuit courtâ€™s order including the award of interest in Bowen v. Bowen, 352 S.C. 494, 556, 575 S.E.2d 553, 556 (2003) and sent a remittitur to the circuit court.Â  Therefore, the circuit courtâ€™s award of interest stands as the law of the case and presents no issue for determination on appeal.Â  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s order is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-304","title":"Ashy v.

Mullinax, of Anderson, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Tony J. Ashy appeals a master-in-equityâ€™s decision upholding the validity of a deed from Tony to ACHI Investments, LLC.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThis appeal concerns the validity of a general warranty deed dated August 23, 2000, whereby Tony conveyed a 2.661-acre parcel of land to ACHI Investments for the stated sum of $75,000.00.Â  The deed was recorded in the Office of the Clerk of Court for Anderson County on August 31, 2000.Â  ACHI is a limited liability company owned by Tonyâ€™s nephew, Ramon J. Ashy, Jr., and his brother (Ramonâ€™s father).Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn early 2000, Tony discussed selling his 2.661-acre parcel in Anderson County with Ramon.Â  At that time, according to Ramon, Tony wanted $50,000.00 for the property.Â Â Â  \r\nAdditional negotiations occurred on August 22, 2000, when Tony, Ramon, and Ramonâ€™s father met for lunch in Greenville.Â  Tony told Ramon he would take no less than $75,000.00 for the property â€œbecause thatâ€™s what [he] owe[d] on it.â€Â  Tony testified he then phoned his wife, who told him he â€œha[d] too much money tied up in that propertyâ€ to sell it. Â After the partiesâ€™ finished their lunch, Ramon let Tony borrow his car because Tonyâ€™s vehicle was being repaired.Â Â Â  \r\nThe next afternoon, according to Tony, Ramon called and asked him to bring the car to his office.Â  Once at the office, Ramon asked Tony to sign a payoff request from the bank â€œbecause the bank would not tell [him] how much [Tony] owe[d] on that property without [his] signature.â€Â  Tony willingly signed the document, and Ramon faxed it to the bank.Â  Instead of driving Tony back to his motherâ€™s house, as Tony expected him to, Ramon stopped at the Pfeiffer and Gantt law firm in Greenville, where Tony signed several other documents.Â Â Â  \r\nIn contrast, Ramon testified Tony knew they were going to the law firm and had scheduled an appointment for that day with the hopes of completing the closing while Tony was still in Greenville.Â  The law firm had already ordered appraisals and title searches the day before when Tony and Ramon had discussed the sales price of the property.Â  While at the law firm, Tony signed several documents:Â  a Form 1099-S recognition, a sellerâ€™s indemnity affidavit, and a general warranty deed.Â  David Gantt, a closing attorney and a partner in the law firm of Pfeiffer and Gantt, and Tilda Burgess, a paralegal, witnessed the deed.Â  There never was a separate, written contract for the sale or escrow of the property.Â Â Â Â  \r\nOver the objection of Tonyâ€™s attorney, Gantt recorded the deed on August 31, 2000.Â  Gantt tendered a check to BB&amp;T to pay off the mortgage and also sent a check of the net proceeds to Tonyâ€™s attorney.Â  According to Gantt, Tony was not paid for the property at the time of closing on August 23rd as the closing had originally been scheduled for the following week on August 30th, so he held the deed in escrow pending the arrival of funds from Palmetto Bank the following week.Â  \r\nThe master upheld the validity of the deed, finding Tony was aware of the contents of the deed and he â€œfully intended to deliver the deed to Gantt to be held pending only the receipt of the proceeds.â€Â  The master concluded there was no legal requirement for a written contract in this case, stating:Â  â€œPart performance, in actuality, complete performance[,] took place when Tony Ashy signed all documents at the closing on August 23, 2000 including the general warranty deed and delivered this deed to Gantt to hold in escrow until the sales proceeds were received.Â  There is no statute of frauds argument in the context of the evidence in this case.â€Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Tony claims the master erred in upholding the validity of the deed because there was no contract of sale or escrow contract supported by valid consideration, thereby violating the Statute of Frauds.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA deed is not legally effective until it has been delivered.â€Â  Donnan v. Mariner, 339 S.C. 621, 627, 529 S.E.2d 754, 757 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Although there is no prescribed method for an effective delivery, the controlling question is the intent of the grantor at the time of the transaction.Â  Id.Â  If a grantor delivers a deed to a grantee or in escrow â€œintending to part with control overâ€ it, the fee passes immediately to the grantees named within the deed.Â  Watson v. Cox, 117 S.C. 24, 28-29, 108 S.E. 168, 169 (1921).Â  \r\nâ€œAn escrow is a deed delivered to a third person upon a future condition to be performed by either party.â€Â  Brockington v. Lynch, 119 S.C. 273, 299, 112 S.E. 94, 103 (1922).Â  Every element of a valid escrow appears where â€œ[t]here are sufficient parties, a proper subject-matter, a consideration, and the parties have . . . contractedâ€ to place a deed in the hands of a third party to be delivered under the condition stated.Â  Id. at 299-300, 112 S.E. at 103.Â  Furthermore, an escrow cannot be revoked unless provided for in the agreement accompanying the escrow.Â  Id. at 300, 112 S.E. at 103.Â  Finally, an agreement to convey real property must be in writing â€œand signed by the party to be charged,â€ as required by the Statute of Frauds.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 32-3-10(4) (1991).Â  \r\nTony testified he did not know he was signing a deed to convey his property and he never intended to sell the property.Â  Tony claimed Gantt asked him to be a witness in a lawsuit against Michael Alakhwan, who allegedly owed Tony money.Â  Tony thought the documents related to that case and Gantt needed him to testify on August 30 or 31, 2000.Â  \r\nIn contrast, Gantt recalled going over each of the documents with Tony.Â  Gantt told Tony he was signing a general warranty deed in consideration of $75,000 being delivered on August 30, 2000.Â  Gantt merely held the deed in escrow pending receipt of the funds.Â  The delay occurred because the closing had originally been scheduled for the following week.Â  Gantt maintained Tony agreed to these terms.Â  The closing lasted between thirty-five and forty minutes.Â Â Â  \r\nTina Burgess, a former paralegal at the law firm who helped with the closing, testified Tony â€œdid not seem to have a problemâ€ understanding or reading any of the documents placed in front of him.Â  Burgess and Gantt witnessed Tonyâ€™s signature on the deed.Â Â Â   \r\nBurgess recalled Tonyâ€™s wife, Debbie Ashy, contacted the law firm on August 29, 2000, and asked when the proceeds from the sale would be distributed.Â  That day, Burgess faxed Debbie the documents signed at the closing with an attached note indicating the distribution of proceeds would be on August 31, 2000.Â  In contradiction to Tonyâ€™s statement about his wifeâ€™s concern of having too much money tied up in the property, Debbie testified she would have minded â€œ[n]ot a bitâ€ if Tony had sold the property.Â  She asserted, however, he did not realize what he had signed.Â  \r\nâ€œWe have consistently followed the rule that ordinarily one cannot complain of fraud in the misrepresentation of the contents of a written instrument signed by him when the truth could have been ascertained by reading the instrument, and that one entering into a written contract should read it and avail himself of every reasonable opportunity to understand its content and meaning.â€Â  Oâ€™Connor v. Bhd. of R.R. Trainmen, 217 S.C. 442, 449, 60 S.E.2d 884, 886&nbsp;(1950).\r\nâ€œThe rule is subject to the exception, which is very strictly interpreted by our Supreme Court, that if the party is ignorant and unwary, his failure to read the document may be excused.â€Â  Stanley Smith &amp; Sons v. D.M.R., Inc., 307 S.C. 413, 417, 415 S.E.2d 428, 431&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1992).Â  â€œThe court must consider an individualâ€™s education, business experience and intelligence in deciding whether a party may be classified as ignorant and unwary.â€Â  Id.  \r\nThe record is replete with evidence of Tonyâ€™s abilities and business experience, including his ownership and operation of a nightclub, a bingo hall, and a gun and police supply store.Â  At the time of this suit, he owned five automobiles, including four Mercedes and â€œone (1) old Rolls-Royce.â€Â  He and his wife owned several properties with a net worth of close to a million dollars.Â  In fact, he acknowledged during cross-examination that he was not altogether an unsophisticated businessman, stating, â€œSometimes. Â Depends.â€Â Â Â  \r\nAs evidenced by Tonyâ€™s signature on multiple documents, including the pay-off request signed before he even attended the closing, the testimony of Gantt and Burgess, inconsistencies in some of Tonyâ€™s rendition of events, and Tonyâ€™s business experience, we can find no error in the masterâ€™s conclusion that Tony intended to deed the property to ACHI on August 23, 2000, contingent only upon receiving the loan proceeds the following week.Â  As noted by the master, the deed itself served to document the transaction, and it was signed by the party to be charged.Â  Accordingly, we agree with the master that the deed was an effective conveyance of the property. \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-305","title":"State v.

Taggart, South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott,Â  Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Warren Blair Giese, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Following a retrial, Vincent Boseman was convicted of armed robbery, simple assault, and resisting arrest.Â  He appeals, arguing the trial court committed reversible error by incorporating certain pretrial rulings from his first trial into the current proceeding.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAt the first trial in December 2000, Boseman was convicted of armed robbery, assault of a high and aggravated nature (AHAN), and resisting arrest for a robbery that occurred on February 14, 1997, at the Town and Tourist motel in Columbia, South Carolina.Â  He was sentenced to life in prison without parole.Â  On appeal, this Court reversed and remanded the matter for a new trial based on an error in remedying a Batson[1] challenge.Â  See State v. Boseman, Op. No. 2003-UP-096 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Feb. 4, 2003).\r\nAt the retrial in July 2003, the State filed a document entitled â€œNo Subsequent Motion,â€ which sought, pursuant to Rule 4(b), SCRCrimP, to prevent any further motions about identification, search and seizure, and other issues of law decided in the first trial that had not been appealed or reversed by an appellate court.[2]Â  On the first day of trial, the State noted it would have one new witness who would have to be examined in camera, but sought to â€œbe allowed to go straight forward in front of the juryâ€ with any witness who had already testified in camera as to the show-up and in-court identifications during the first trial on the basis the judge in the first trial had already found their testimony to be admissible.Â  Defense counsel objected, arguing the current trial was a new proceeding for which the previous rulings were not binding.Â  \r\nThe trial court stated it would â€œaccept Judge Williamsâ€™s [James C. Williams, Jr.] rulings that were made as being bound upon this court as far as what those witnesses would testify to, and also the decisions and conclusions reached by Judge Williams in the prior proceeding.â€Â  The court ordered that portions of the trial transcript, including the pretrial motions and the rulings on those motions, be incorporated into the record of the current proceeding.[3]Â  \r\nAt the conclusion of the trial, Boseman was convicted of armed robbery, simple assault (as a lesser-included offense of AHAN), and resisting arrest.Â  He was again sentenced to life in prison without parole.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, an appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001).Â  The appellate court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s preliminary factual findings in determining the admissibility of certain evidence in criminal cases, and on appeal we are limited to determining whether the trial court abused its discretion.Â  Id.Â  We do not re-evaluate the facts based on our own view of the preponderance of the evidence, but instead simply determine whether the trial courtâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Boseman argues the trial court committed reversible error warranting a new trial by incorporating as binding certain portions of the pretrial transcript and rulings from his first trial.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt the first trial in 2000, Willie McCalvin and Carl Holmes identified Boseman as the person who had robbed a group of people at gunpoint at the Town and Tourist motel on February 14, 1997.Â  \r\nAt the second trial in 2003, Carl Holmes did not testify.Â  Willie McCalvin was the first witness up and testified in detail about the events of the robbery.Â  McCalvin made an in-court identification of Boseman as the robber without objection.Â  \r\nA new witness who did not testify at the first trial, Howard Smith, was introduced at the retrial and subjected to an in camera review by the trial court.Â  Smith confirmed that he had immediately identified Boseman to the police at the scene when the incident occurred in 1997, but he was not able to make an in-court identification of Boseman at the time of this trial in 2003.Â  \r\nThus, the issue of incorporating the first trialâ€™s pretrial rulings is relevant only as to McCalvin, who testified in camera during the first trialâ€™s pretrial hearing and who testified at the retrial.Â  \r\nInitially, we question whether the issue raised here is preserved.Â  The trial courtâ€™s ruling regarding the admissibility of the evidence was made after the jury was selected but before it was sworn, which normally would be considered an in limine ruling.Â  Where a ruling on the admissibility of evidence is made in limine, it is generally not a final ruling and is subject to change pending developments at trial.Â  State v. Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 541 S.E.2d 837 (2001).Â  Thus, any objection must be renewed when the evidence comes in.Â  Id.Â  As noted above, however, no objection was made to McCalvinâ€™s identification of Boseman.[4]Â  \r\nThis case is unusual, however, because the trial court indicated it was making a final ruling in this regard by stating it was â€œboundâ€ by the decision in the first trial.Â  Further, McCalvin was the first witness up and no evidence came in between the courtâ€™s ruling and the identification; however, before McCalvin testified, the court heard Smithâ€™s in camera testimony, made rulings on other pretrial matters, instructed the jury on general procedures and had them sworn, following which counsel for both sides made opening statements.Â  Cf. State v. Mueller, 319 S.C. 266, 268-69, 460 S.E.2d 409, 410-11 (Ct. App. 1995) (stating an in limine motion is a pretrial procedure and the ruling is subject to change depending on the development of the case, so the losing party must renew his objection at trial to preserve the issue for appeal; the court held that a ruling on the admissibility of evidence made immediately before a witness testified during trial was not a preliminary ruling, but was final, thus distinguishing it from an in limine motion, and that the party was not required to renew an objection). \r\nEven if the issue raised here is preserved, we nevertheless find no error warranting reversal.Â  \r\nWhen evidence is erroneously admitted, â€œreversal is not required unless the appellant was prejudiced by the error.â€Â  State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985) (citation omitted).Â  \r\n\r\nWhether an error is harmless depends on the circumstances of the particular case.Â  No definite rule of law governs this finding; rather, the materiality and prejudicial character of the error must be determined from its relationship to the entire case.Â  Error is harmless when it â€œcould not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.â€\r\n\r\nId. (quoting State v. Key, 256 S.C. 90, 180 S.E.2d 888 (1971)).\r\nWe hold that, even assuming the trial court committed error, Boseman has not shown what, if any, prejudice he has suffered that would justify a reversal.\r\nIn addition to McCalvinâ€™s testimony identifying Boseman, another victim, Howard Smith, testified about the robbery as noted above and confirmed that immediately after the incident, he had identified Boseman to police at the scene.Â  The police had immediately descended on the motel and apprehended Boseman after hearing a shot Boseman fired as he left the victimsâ€™ room.Â  Additionally, officer Brian Oâ€™Connell testified that a search at the scene revealed Boseman had in his possession a cell phone, identification, and money belonging to the victims.Â  This evidence came in without objection.Â  Based on the foregoing, we find any testimony offered by McCalvin could not have prejudiced this case and note that Boseman has offered no specific arguments or evidence regarding any prejudice.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).\r\n[2]Â  Rule 4(b) provides:Â  â€œIf any motion be made to any judge and be denied, in whole or in part, or be granted conditionally, no subsequent motion upon the same set of facts shall be made to any other judge in that action.Â  If upon such subsequent motion any order be made, it shall be void.â€Â  Rule 4(b), SCRCrimP.Â  The State also asserts in the motion that â€œthe parties are collaterally estopped from re-arguing the same issues,â€ but the concept of collateral estoppel clearly is not implicated here.Â  \r\n[3]Â  In its brief, the State argues the incorporation of the pretrial rulings was â€œpreciselyâ€ what Boseman wanted.Â  This statement is misleading, however.Â  Once the trial court determined the previous pretrial rulings would be binding, Boseman then agreed, despite his continuing objection to the ruling, that he wanted the transcript incorporated into the record for purposes of appeal.Â  \r\n[4]Â  Further, items recovered from Boseman by the police also came in without objection.Â  At the end of the trial, defense counsel did move for a mistrial.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-306","title":"Pressley v.

Cole, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Larry Wayne and Linda Pressley appeal the trial courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment to Jason Keith Blackwell on the ground that the Pressleysâ€™ claim was barred by the statute of limitations.Â  Counsel for the Pressleys also argues he received insufficient notice of the summary judgment hearing.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nLarry Wayne Pressley and Blackwell were involved in a motor vehicle accident in Cherokee County on June 5, 1999.Â  Blackwellâ€™s liability insurer paid its entire coverage to the Pressleys in exchange for a covenant not to execute.Â  On May 31, 2002, the Pressleys filed this action in Anderson County in an attempt to collect from their underinsured motorist carrier, Nationwide Insurance Company (Nationwide).Â  \r\nOn June 3, 2002, the Pressleys attempted to serve the summons and complaint on Blackwell through the Cherokee County Sheriffâ€™s Office.Â  The next day, the Sheriffâ€™s Office reported Blackwell could not be served, noting the reason as â€œEmpty resident/No forwarding address.â€Â  \r\nOn June 20, 2002, the Pressleys served Nationwide through the Department of Insurance.Â  Counsel for Nationwide filed a notice of appearance and denied representing Blackwell.Â  He also wrote a letter to counsel for the Pressleys specifically advising that he would take no further action, nor file an answer, until Blackwell was properly served.Â  \r\nOn July 23, 2002, the Pressleys filed a motion requesting an order allowing for service by publication.Â  By order dated July 31, 2002, the trial court granted the motion.Â  The order directed that publication be made in The Gaffney Ledger at least one time per week for three consecutive weeks.Â  The order further required the first publication be made within ten (10) days from the date of the order.Â  Publication did not begin, however, until September 18, 2002, and was not completed until October 2, 2002.Â  \r\nCounsel for Blackwell subsequently filed an Answer raising the issues of, inter alia, improper venue and statute of limitations.Â  Venue was thereafter transferred to Cherokee County.Â  On June 30, 2003, Blackwell filed and served a motion for summary judgment.Â  By order filed November 13, 2003, the trial court granted the motion, finding the Pressleys failed to timely serve Blackwell.Â  The Pressleys appeal. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact and the conclusions and inferences to be drawn from the facts are undisputed.â€Â  McClanahan v. Richland County Council, 350 S.C. 433, 437, 567 S.E.2d 240, 242 (2002).Â  Additionally, in ruling on a motion for summary judgment, a reviewing court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id. at 438, 567 S.E.2d at 242.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Statute of Limitations \r\nThe Pressleys argue the trial court erred in granting summary judgment based on the expiration of the statute of limitations.Â  We disagree.\r\nA plaintiff in a negligence action must serve the defendant within three years.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(5) (2005).Â  The statute of limitations may, however, be tolled.Â  See Rule 3, SCRCP; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-20 (2005).Â  \r\nAt the time of the accrual of this action, Rule 3 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provided in part:\r\n\r\na)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commencement:Â  A civil action is commenced by filing and service of a summons and complaint.\r\nb)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolling of Statute of Limitations:Â  For the purpose of tolling any statute of limitations, an attempt to commence an action is equivalent to the commencement thereof when the summons and complaint are filed with the clerk of court and delivered for service to the sheriff . . . provided that actual service must be accomplished within a reasonable time thereafter.\r\n\r\nRule 3, SCRCP (Supp. 2002), amended effective April 27, 2004 (emphasis added).Â  \r\nEffective May 24, 2002, a few days prior to the filing of this action, S.C. Code section 15-3-20(B) was amended to provide in part:Â  â€œA civil action is commenced when the summons and complaint are filed with the clerk of court if actual service is accomplished within one hundred twenty days after filing.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-20(B) (2005) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nBy amendment effective April 27, 2004, Rule 3 was likewise amended to provide:\r\n\r\na)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commencement of civil action:Â \r\nA civil action is commenced when the summons and complaint are filed with the clerk of court if:\r\n  \r\n1)Â Â Â Â Â  the summons and complaint are served within the statute of limitations in any manner prescribed by law; or\r\n2)Â Â Â Â Â  if not served within the statute of limitations, actual service must be accomplished not later than one hundred twenty days after filing.\r\n  \r\n\r\nRule 3, SCRCP (emphasis added).Â  With this history in mind, we review the Pressleysâ€™ argument.\r\nIn interpreting Rule 3 prior to the amendment, South Carolina courts found service by publication five months after filing of the complaint was reasonable but service more than a year after filing was unreasonable.Â  Compare Ingle v. Whitlock, 282 S.C. 391, 318 S.E.2d 367 (1984) with Montgomery v. Mullins, 325 S.C. 500, 506, 480 S.E.2d 467, 470 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œWhether or not an action has been accomplished within a reasonable period of time depends on the circumstances of the case.â€Â  Montgomery, 325 S.C. at 506, 480 S.E.2d at 470.Â  This decision is committed to the trial judgeâ€™s discretion, and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe accident in this case occurred on June 5, 1999, and the statute of limitations period expired on June 5, 2002.Â  The Pressleys attempted to take advantage of the Rule 3(b) tolling provision by delivering the summons and complaint to the Cherokee County Sheriffâ€™s Office.Â  However, the Sheriffâ€™s Office was unable to serve Blackwell, and actual service was not accomplished until publication was completed on October 2, 2002.Â  \r\nBlackwell argues that section 15-3-20(B) mandated service within 120 days after the case is filed and this mandate applied to the Pressleys.Â  We find the amendment provides an indication of legislative intent that even prior to the amendment, a reasonable time would ordinarily be within 120 days.Â  We need not determine whether the 120-day test or the reasonable time test controls in this case, however, as we find neither test has been met.\r\nThe trial judge ruled that service was not accomplished within a reasonable time.Â  We find no abuse of discretion given the facts and circumstances of this case, including failure to accomplish service within 120 days and dilatoriness in commencing publication.Â  Given the totality of these circumstances and our standard of review, we will not disturb the trial courtâ€™s finding that service was not accomplished within a reasonable time.\r\nFurthermore, counsel failed to comply with a direct order from the court.Â  The publication order required service to commence within ten days.Â  The first publication was not made until nearly forty days after this deadline had expired.Â  Counsel for the Pressleys did not communicate any hardship or difficulty to the court.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s finding that this action is barred by the statute of limitations.\r\nII.Â  Notice of Hearing\r\nThe Pressleys also contend their due process rights were violated because they were not provided with adequate notice of the hearing.Â  This issue was never raised to the trial court in a Rule 59(e) motion or in any other manner other than a letter of protest to the trial court.Â  Issues not raised to and ruled upon by the trial court are not preserved for appeal.Â  In Re McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 551 S.E.2d 235 (2001) (â€œA constitutional claim must be raised and ruled upon to be preserved for appellate review.â€).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order on appeal is\r\n AFFIRMED.Â  \r\n SHORT, J., concurs.\r\nANDERSON, J., concurs in result only in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J. (concurring in result only):Â  I agree with the majority that summary judgment should be affirmed.Â  I write separately because the amendment to S.C. Code Ann. section 15-3-20, which took effect seven days before the Pressleys filed their action, controls the disposition of this case.Â \r\nI.Â  CHRONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT OF\r\nSECTION 15-3-20 AND RULE 3\r\nFrom the enactment of the 1976 Code until May 23, 2002, section 15-3-20 stated: â€œCivil actions can only be commenced within the periods prescribed in this Title after the cause of action shall have accrued, except when, in special cases, a different limitation is prescribed by statute.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. (1976).Â  \r\nThe 2002 version of Rule 3, SCRCP, provided:\r\n\r\n(a) Â Â Â  Commencement.Â  A civil action is commenced by filing and service of a summons and complaint.\r\n(b) Â Â Â  Tolling of Statute of Limitations.Â  For the purpose of tolling any statute of limitations, an attempt to commence an action is equivalent to the commencement thereof when the summons and complaint are filed with the clerk of court and delivered for service to the sheriff of the county in which defendant usually or last resided . . . ; provided that actual service must be accomplished within a reasonable time thereafter.Â  \r\n\r\nRule 3, SCRCP (2002) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nEffective May 24, 2002, section 15-3-20 was amended to read:\r\n\r\n(A) Â Â  Civil actions may only be commenced within the periods prescribed in this title after the cause of action has accrued, except when, in special cases, a different limitation is prescribed by statute.\r\n(B)Â Â Â  A civil action is commenced when the summons and complaint are filed with the clerk of court if actual service is accomplished within one hundred twenty days after filing.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. section 15-3-20 (2005) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nSubsequent to the amendment to section 15-3-20, Rule 3 was changed.Â  The rule now reads:\r\n\r\n (a)Â Â Â Â  Commencement of civil action.Â  A civil action is commenced when the summons and complaint are filed with the clerk of court if:\r\n(1)Â Â Â Â  the summons and complaint are served within the statute of limitations in any manner prescribed by law; or\r\n(2)Â Â Â Â  if not served within the statute of limitations, actual service must be accomplished not later than one hundred twenty days after filing.\r\n\r\nRule 3, SCRCP (emphasis added).Â  The note to the 2004 amendment to Rule 3 officially reports that the changes effected â€œare intended to reflect the legislative intent expressed in Â§ 15-3-20 as amended by 2002 S.C. Act No. 281, Â§ 1.â€Â  (Emphasis added.)Â Â Â  \r\nII.Â  PRINCIPLES OF STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to determine the intent of the legislature.Â  Georgia-Carolina Bail Bonds. v. County of Aiken, 354 S.C. 18, 579 S.E.2d 334 (Ct. App. 2003); see also Gordon v. Phillips Utils. Inc., 362 S.C. 403, ___, 608 S.E.2d 425, 427 (2005) (â€œThe primary purpose in construing a statute is to ascertain legislative intent.â€); Olson v. Faculty House of Carolina, Inc., 344 S.C. 194, 205, 544 S.E.2d 38, 44 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œThe quintessence of statutory construction is legislative intent.â€).Â  All rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one that legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used, and that language must be construed in the light of the intended purpose of the statute.Â  McClanahan v. Richland County Council, 350 S.C. 433, 567 S.E.2d 240 (2002); Ray Bell Constr. Co. v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville County, 331 S.C. 19, 501 S.E.2d 725 (1998); State v. Morgan, 352 S.C. 359, 574 S.E.2d 203 (Ct. App. 2002); State v. Hudson, 336 S.C. 237, 519 S.E.2d 577 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\nThe legislatureâ€™s intent should be ascertained primarily from the plain language of the statute.Â  State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 606 S.E.2d 503 (Ct. App. 2004); Morgan, 352 S.C. at 366, 574 S.E.2d at 206; Stephen v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 478 S.E.2d 74 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The language must also be read in a sense which harmonizes with its subject matter and accords with its general purpose.Â  Hitachi Data Sys. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 420 S.E.2d 843 (1992); Morgan, 352 S.C. at 366, 574 S.E.2d at 206; Hudson, 336 S.C. at 246, 519 S.E.2d at 582.Â  The courtâ€™s primary function in interpreting a statute is to ascertain the intent of the General Assembly.Â  Smith v. South Carolina Ins. Co., 350 S.C. 82, 564 S.E.2d 358 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œOnce the legislature has made [a] choice, there is no room for the courts to impose a different judgment based upon their own notions of public policy.â€Â  South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mumford, 299 S.C. 14, 19, 382 S.E.2d 11, 14 (Ct. App. 1989).\r\nIf a statuteâ€™s language is unambiguous and clear, there is no need to employ the rules of statutory construction and this Court has no right to look for or impose another meaning.Â  Tilley v. Pacesetter Corp., 355 S.C. 361, 585 S.E.2d 292 (2003); Paschal v. State Election Commâ€™n, 317 S.C. 434, 454 S.E.2d 890 (1995); Cowan v. Allstate Ins. Co., 351 S.C. 626, 631, 571 S.E.2d 715, 717 (Ct. App. 2002); Olson, 344 S.C. at 207, 544 S.E.2d at 45; see also City of Camden v. Brassell, 326 S.C. 556, 561, 486 S.E.2d 492, 495 (Ct. App. 1997) (â€œWhere the language of the statute is clear and explicit, the court cannot rewrite the statute and inject matters into it which are not in the legislatureâ€™s language.â€).Â  When the terms of a statute are clear, the court must apply those terms according to their literal meaning.Â  Cooper v. Moore, 351 S.C. 207, 212, 569 S.E.2d 330, 332 (2002); Holley v. Mount Vernon Mills, Inc., 312 S.C. 320, 440 S.E.2d 373 (1994); Carolina Alliance for Fair Employment v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing, &amp; Regulation, 337 S.C. 476, 523 S.E.2d 795 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  What a legislature says in the text of a statute is considered the best evidence of the legislative intent or will. Bayle v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 542 S.E.2d 736 (Ct. App. 2001). The words of a statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction.Â  Durham v. United Companies Fin. Corp., 331 S.C. 600, 503 S.E.2d 465 (1998); Adkins v. Comcar Indus., Inc., 323 S.C. 409, 475 S.E.2d 762 (1996); Worsley Cos. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 351 S.C. 97, 102, 567 S.E.2d 907, 910 (Ct. App. 2002); see also Timmons v. South Carolina Tricentennial Commâ€™n, 254 S.C. 378, 175 S.E.2d 805 (1970) (observing that where the language of the statute is clear and explicit, the court cannot rewrite the statute and inject matters into it that are not in the legislatureâ€™s language).Â  Under the plain meaning rule, it is not the courtâ€™s place to change the meaning of a clear and unambiguous statute.Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 533 S.E.2d 578 (2000); Bayle, 344 S.C. at 122, 542 S.E.2d at 739.\r\nIf the language of an act gives rise to doubt or uncertainty as to legislative intent, the construing court may search for that intent beyond the borders of the act itself.Â  Morgan, 352 S.C. at 367, 574 S.E.2d at 207; see also Wade v. Berkeley County, 348 S.C. 224, 229, 559 S.E.2d 586, 588 (2002) (â€œ[W]here a statute is ambiguous, the Court must construe the terms of the statute.â€). An ambiguity in a statute should be resolved in favor of a just, beneficial, and equitable operation of the law.Â  Hudson, 336 S.C. at 247, 519 S.E.2d at 582; Brassell, 326 S.C. at 561, 486 S.E.2d at 495; City of Sumter Police Depâ€™t v. One (1) 1992 Blue Mazda Truck, 330 S.C. 371, 498 S.E.2d 894 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  In construing a statute, the court looks to the language as a whole in light of its manifest purpose.Â  State v. Dawkins, 352 S.C. 162, 573 S.E.2d 783 (2002); Adams v. Texfi Indus., 320 S.C. 213, 464 S.E.2d 109 (1995); Brassell, 326 S.C. at 560, 486 S.E.2d at 494.\r\nâ€œA statute as a whole must receive a practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of the lawmakers.Â  The real purpose and intent of the lawmakers will prevail over the literal import of the words.â€Â  Browning v. Hartvigsen, 307 S.C. 122, 125, 414 S.E.2d 115, 117 (1992); see also Georgia-Carolina Bail Bonds, 354 S.C. at 22, 579 S.E.2d at 336 (â€œA statute should be given a reasonable and practical construction consistent with the purpose and policy expressed in the statute.â€); Municipal Assâ€™n of South Carolina v. AT &amp; T Communications of S. States, Inc., 361 S.C. 576, 606 S.E.2d 468 (2004) (observing that the language of a statute must be read in a sense which harmonizes with its subject matter and accords with its general purpose).Â  \r\nCourts will reject a statutory interpretation which would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it could not have been intended by the legislature or would defeat the plain legislative intention.Â  Unisun Ins. Co. v. Schmidt, 339 S.C. 362, 529 S.E.2d 280 (2000); Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 440 S.E.2d 364 (1994).Â  A court should not consider a particular clause in a statute as being construed in isolation, but should read it in conjunction with the purpose of the whole statute and the policy of the law.Â  See Hinton v. South Carolina Dept. of Prob., Parole and Pardon Servs., 357 S.C. 327, 592 S.E.2d 335 (Ct. App. 2004), cert. granted (Jan. 12, 2005); Doe v. Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 578 S.E.2d 733 (Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied. \r\nIII.Â  JUXTAPOSITION OF THE RULES OF\r\nCIVIL PROCEDURE TO THE CODE OF LAWS \r\nArticle V, section 4, of the South Carolina Constitution decrees: â€œThe Supreme Court shall make rules governing the administration of all the courts of the State.Â  Subject to the statutory law, the Supreme Court shall make rules governing the practice and procedure in all such courts.â€Â  In Stokes v. Denmark Emergency Medical Services, 315 S.C. 263, 267, 433 S.E.2d 850, 852 (1993), our supreme court explained, â€œThe clause â€˜subject to the statutory lawâ€™ establishes the intent to subordinate to the General Assembly the Courtâ€™s rulemaking power in regard to practice and procedure.â€Â  Accordingly, although the supreme court has wide latitude to regulate the procedures of South Carolinaâ€™s courts, the General Assembly retains a greater authority to govern the operation of our judicial system.\r\nIV.Â  ANALYSIS\r\nThe Pressleys filed the action in the instant case on May 31, 2002â€”after the promulgation of the statutory amendment, but before the change in the rule.Â  Consequently, the procedural aspects of this case are governed by the 2002 version of Rule 3 and amended section 15-3-20.Â  \r\nThe 2002 form of Rule 3 provides that service may be proper so long as actual service is accomplished within a reasonable time after the summons and complaint are filed with the clerk of court and delivered to the sheriff.Â  However, section 15-3-20 plainly does away with a reasonable time analysis by providing actual service must be accomplished within 120 days after filing.Â  Our General Assembly drew a bold, bright, and unambiguous line.Â  This lucid and edictal change to section 15-3-20 leaves no room for equivocation over its meaning.Â  Indeed, the efficacy of amended 15-3-20 is proved by the note to new Rule 3 which expressly states the rule was revised to bring it into conformity with the legislatureâ€™s intent in altering the statute in 2002.Â Â Â  \r\nThe Pressleys did not meet the 120-day deadline.Â  The bill that amended section 15-3-20 provided: â€œThis act takes effect upon approval by the Governor and applies to causes of action filed on or after this actâ€™s effective date.â€Â  Act No. 281, 2002 S.C. Acts 2726.Â  Act No. 281 became law on May 24, 2002.Â  Indubitably, the amendment was in effect when the Pressleys filed their action on May 31, 2002.Â  Actual service was not complete until the final publication on October 2, 2002.Â  Compliance with section 15-3-20 would have required the Pressleys to accomplish service by September 28, 2002, 120 days after May 31.Â  Thus, because the Pressleys failed to satisfy the statute of limitations, summary judgment was properly granted. \r\nV.Â  CONCLUSION\r\nThe chronological evolution of the statute and rule reveals a judicial progression to the status of the mandatory provision in the statute: â€œA civil action is commenced when the summons and complaint are filed with the clerk of court if actual service is accomplished within one hundred twenty days after filing.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. section 15-3-20(B) (2005).Â  The applicability of precedent, statutory construction principles, and a commonsensical analysis bring me to the ineluctable conclusion that the statutory language is efficacious and controlling.Â  In contrariety to the majority opinion, I hold that section 15-3-20(B) is an absolute and mandatory revelation of legislative intent that a reasonable time is delimited by a calendar application of 120 days.Â  Section 15-3-20 creates a bright-line test.Â  In simplistic terms, the rule amendment by the South Carolina Supreme Court evidences a concurrent response to reflect the legislative intent expressed by the South Carolina General Assembly in the amendatory language encapsulated in section 15-3-20.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-307","title":"State v.

Swerling, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief\r\nDeputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson,Â  and Assistant Assistant Attorney General David Spencer, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Larry Dean McCluney was convicted of trafficking in â€œmore than 400 grams of cocaine.â€ The trial judge sentenced McCluney to twenty-five years imprisonment and a $200,000 fine. On appeal he contends the trial judge erred in (1) refusing to permit cross-examination of a witness, (2) refusing to grant him a directed verdict where he was charged with trafficking in cocaine and the evidence showed the cocaine was imitation, and (3) sustaining the Stateâ€™s objection to a question to a witness on the grounds of hearsay. The previous opinion of this court, State v. McCluneyÂ­, Â Opinion No. 3742, filed February 2, 2004 reversed the decision of the trial court holding that, because McCluney was in possession of imitation cocaine, he was improperly indicted under the trafficking statute. On certiorari to the South CarolinaÂ  Supreme Court, our decision was reversed with that court holding the gravemen of the crime for which McCluney was charged was â€œconspiring and attempting to purchase ten grams or more of real cocaine [which] constitutes trafficking.â€ State v. McCluney, Opinion No. 25909 at p. 32 (Shearouse Advance Sheet No. 48, filed December 13, 2004). Thus, the directed verdict issue based on imitation cocaine is now moot.\r\nWe affirm the remaining two issues pursuant to Rule 220(b)(2), SCACR, and the following authorities: State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 481 S.E.2d 118 (1997) (holding an objection to the admission of evidence must be specifically stated to preserve an issue for appeal); State v. Roper, 274 S.C. 14, 20, 260 S.E.2d 705 (1979 (â€œIt is well settled that a reviewing court may not consider error alleged in [the] exclusion of testimony unless the record on appeal shows fairly what the rejected testimony would have beenâ€)Â  State v. Smith, 315 S.C. 547, 446 S.E.2d 411 (1994) (a violation of the right to confrontation is not per se reversible error but is subject to a harmless error analysis); State v. Burton, 326 S.C. 605, 486 S.E.2d 762 (Ct. App. 1997) (error is harmless where it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial); 89 C.J.S. Trial, section 661, at 504 (1995) (â€œThe erroneous admission of evidence may be waived by some affirmative act done after the ruling on the admission of the evidence which amounts to an express or implied assent to the reception of the evidence or by acts or statements inconsistent with objections previously urged.â€). \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, JJ, and CURETON, AJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-308","title":"State v.

Lee and Patrick R. Martin, of Minneapolis, MN; and Phillip Florence and Thomas Gottshall, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this product liability case, Appellants are students of South Carolina State University (SCSU) who were injured when a water heater began emanating carbon monoxide.Â  Appellants brought an action against the university and the manufacturers of the water heater before settling these claims.Â  Honeywell, Inc., the supplier of one of the components of the hot water heater, remained as the lone defendant.Â  Appellants asserted numerous theories of liability and the trial judge granted summary judgment.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn August 29, 1998, a water heater issued toxic fumes into a dormitory that killed one student in an adjacent room and affected several other students.Â  Tests conducted shortly after the incident indicated concentrations of carbon monoxide were present in the room where the water heater was located and in the dormitory rooms in the immediate vicinity.Â  \r\nRheem Manufacturing Co., Inc. manufactured the water heater while SCSU installed and maintained it.Â  The water heater design included an energy saving damper that closed the flue opening when the water heater was not in operation.Â  The damper consisted of a metal flap at the top of the water heater that was designed to open prior to burner operation to allow the combustion products to vent.Â  Rheem manufactured the damper assembly.Â  The damper was attached by a rod to a damper actuator motor which powered the damper to open and close.Â  Honeywell supplied the actuator motor, a Honeywell model M892, and a small arrow coupler clip to Rheem.Â Â Â  \r\nBecause of the danger of carbon monoxide production, the damper assembly was required to have a backup mechanism to ensure that the damper opened when the water heater was on in case of motive power failure or deenergization of the vent damper device.Â  Although Honeywell also manufactured a complete damper assembly that incorporated such a failsafe mechanism, the D892, Rheem did not use this product.Â  Instead, Rheem designed its own damper assembly and incorporated only the M892 actuator motor from Honeywell.Â  \r\nWhen Honeywell originally designed D892, it incorporated a return spring to pull the damper to a fully open position.[2]Â  The D892 was certified for compliance with applicable industry standards.Â  \r\nHoneywell subsequently decided to sell the actuator motor separately to manufacturers who wanted to build their own damper assemblies.Â  The M892 was a motor that caused a ninety degree rotation of a shaft which was a standard item that could be used in a variety of applications.Â  Appellantsâ€™ expert testified that the M892 was â€œa proven product with a history of manufacture of around a hundred thousand unitsâ€ and that as a stand-alone component, it was â€œa functional motor that satisfie[d] the intent of [industry] specifications.â€Â  Appellantsâ€™ expert further agreed that the M892 by itself was safe.Â  \r\nÂ Because the M892 could be used to power a damper assembly, Honeywell provided a warning label notifying purchasers that the completed damper assembly would need a failsafe device to open the damper.Â  The original warning label specified a spring for this purpose, similar to the design of the D892.Â  The warning label was Honeywellâ€™s only means of insuring the safety of the final product.Â  \r\nWhen Rheem designed its damper, however, Rheem elected not to use a spring.Â  Rheem made this decision in order to avoid using moving parts and because of concerns that the spring could be subject to corrosion or tampering and therefore elected to use a counterweight instead.Â  \r\nDuring the design phase, Rheem and Honeywell discussed certain problems with the application.Â  One difficulty was that the damper, incorporating the Honeywell motor, would not close all the way.Â  Engineers from Rheem and Honeywell met and determined that Honeywellâ€™s motor was not at fault.Â  Instead, parts of the damper assembly were interfering with each other to prevent closure.Â  Later, Rheem requested that the warning label be changed to reflect its decision to use a counterweight.Â  Honeywell approved the change, realizing that alternate means of accomplishing the purpose served by the spring existed.Â  The warning labels shipped to Rheem called for a â€œreturn mechanismâ€ instead of a â€œreturn springâ€ to serve as a failsafe device.Â  \r\nOnce these problems were resolved, Honeywell approved the application.Â  Rheem then sought and obtained American Gas Association (AGA) certification of the complete water heater.Â  AGA used test data on the M892 from Honeywellâ€™s D892 certification to complete the test report.Â  Honeywell did not test the final damper assembly because the testing was performed by Rheem. \r\nAppellantsâ€™ experts attributed the release of the carbon monoxide to three main factors: (1) improper maintenance and installation of the water heater; (2) improper design of the water heater which allowed condensation to drip on the burner; and (3) incomplete venting due to a faulty damper assembly.Â  Since Rheem and SCSU are no longer parties to this action, the only remaining issues relate to the damper assembly.\r\nWhen the responding public agencies arrived to test the water heater the morning after the incident, they saw SCSU employees leaving the utility room carrying duct tape and hand tools.Â  The responding officials were concerned because the utility room was supposed to have been a taped-off secure area.Â  SCSU employees admitted they found the damper assembly disconnected from the motor and tried unsuccessfully to reattach it with duct tape.Â  They could not connect the parts because a coupler was missing.Â  \r\nHoneywellâ€™s expert testified that the damper assembly had been intentionally disconnected because the connecting rod was bent and the motors holding Honeywellâ€™s motor in place were either missing or loose.Â  With the motor disconnected, the damper was found in a half-open position, roughly two to three oâ€™clock, rather than a twelve oâ€™clock position.Â  \r\nAppellantsâ€™ expert testified that the damper had been disconnected â€œ[w]ithin a couple hours of the incident.â€Â  He further testified that the damperâ€™s half-open position produced decreased draft, and was thus one of the contributing causes of the carbon monoxide production.Â  \r\nThe day after the incident occurred, SCSUâ€™s Police Department measured carbon monoxide levels in the dormitory rooms.Â  The results established the presence of the gas, but only in the immediate vicinity of the water heater.[3]Â  Police also found carbon monoxide levels on the outside of the building across from the water heater room.Â  Appellantsâ€™ expert testified that carbon monoxide could have spread throughout the building through the ventilation system. Â However, none of Appellantsâ€™ experts did any testing on SCSUâ€™s ventilation to verify their theories.Â  Additionally, one of their experts testified he could not opine that it was more probable than not that carbon monoxide spread throughout the building.Â  \r\nThe amended complaint alleges six causes of action against Honeywell, including negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, unfair trade practices, tortious interference with contract, product liability and breach of warranty claims.Â  After a lengthy discovery, Honeywell moved for summary judgment on all claims.Â  The trial court granted Honeywellâ€™s motion.Â  This appeal follows. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nâ€œSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact and the conclusions and inferences to be drawn from the facts are undisputed.â€Â  McClanahan v. Richland County Council, 350 S.C. 433, 437, 567 S.E.2d 240, 242 (2002).Â  Additionally, in ruling on a motion for summary judgment, a reviewing court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id. at 438, 567 S.E.2d at 242. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Product Liability Claims\r\nTo establish a product liability claim under both negligence and strict liability theories, a plaintiff must show (1) that he was injured by the product; (2) that the product, at the time of the accident, was in essentially the same condition as when it left the hands of the defendant; and (3) that the injury occurred because the product was in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user.Â  Allen v. Long Mfg. NC, Inc., 332 S.C. 422, 426, 505 S.E.2d 354, 356 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Under a negligence theory, a plaintiff must additionally demonstrate that the defendant seller or manufacturer failed to exercise due care with respect to safety in the productâ€™s design.Â  Id. at 426-27, 505 S.E.2d at 356.Â  \r\nA. Defective Design\r\nAppellants first assert that Honeywellâ€™s M892 was defective due to a flaw in its design.Â  Honeywell defends on the ground that, as the component manufacturer of the M892 only, it should not be liable for the design flaws of the entire Rheem damper assembly.Â  Although Appellants claim that the M892 was defective, there is no evidence in the record that the M892 itself failed.Â  Appellantsâ€™ expert admitted that the M892, as a standalone unit, was safe.[4]Â  Therefore, the trial court correctly found that the M892 itself was not defective.\r\nSouth Carolina courts have not addressed the liability of the manufacturer of a nondefective component for design defects in the final product.Â  â€œGenerally, a manufacturer of a component part is not liable for injuries caused by the component when it is incorporated into a finished product by a third party where the component in and of itself was not unreasonably dangerous at the time it left the component manufacturerâ€™s control.â€Â  63 Am. Jur. 2d Products Liability Â§ 147 (2004).\r\nFurthermore, a component part manufacturer generally has no duty to analyze the safety of a completed product that incorporates its nondefective component part.Â  Childress v. Gresen Mfg. Co., 888 F.2d 45 (6th Cir. 1989).Â  Imposing such a duty would require component part manufacturers to guarantee the safety of other manufacturersâ€™ machinery.Â  Crossfield v. Quality Control Equip. Co., 1 F.3d 701, 704 (8th Cir. 1993).Â  \r\nThe only exception to this rule occurs when the component manufacturer substantially participates in the integration of the component into the design of the final product.Â  See Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability Â§ 5(b)(1).Â  Courts usually determine whether the component manufacturer substantially participated in the final design by asking whether the seller had control over the design of the completed product.Â  See e.g. Jacobs v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., 67 F.3d 1219, 1242 (6th Cir. 1995).Â  A component manufacturer that merely designs a component to its buyerâ€™s specifications does not â€œsubstantially participateâ€ for products liability purposes.Â  Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability Â§ 5 cmt. e.Â  Moreover, providing mechanical or technical services or advice concerning a component part does not, by itself, subject a component seller to liability.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe record shows that Honeywellâ€™s engineers met with Rheemâ€™s engineers to discuss a problem that developed in pairing Honeywellâ€™s motor to Rheemâ€™s damper assembly.Â  Additionally, Rheem requested and received approval from Honeywell to use a counterweight and to change the warning label to acknowledge Rheemâ€™s application.Â  At most, this establishes that Honeywell knew of the intended use for the M892 and that Honeywell provided mechanical or technical services or advice.Â  Without more, Honeywell is not subject to liability for defects in Rheemâ€™s final damper assembly design, because Appellants have failed to provide any evidence that Honeywell had control over Rheemâ€™s choice of design. \r\nB. Inadequate Warning\r\nAppellants next argue that Honeywell failed to provide an adequate warning.Â  South Carolina recognizes the principle that a seller of a dangerous product must provide an adequate warning to the user to prevent liability.Â  Allen at 427, 505 S.E.2d at 357.Â  However, we note that there is no evidence that the M892 was dangerous.Â  Additionally, it is undisputed that Rheem received notice of the warning requiring a spring because Rheem requested the change in the language on the warning label.\r\nEven if this were not true, however, Honeywell would still not be liable.Â  Component parts manufacturers generally have no duty to warn end users of the potentially dangerous uses to which their products may be put.Â  Jacobs, 67 F.3d at 1236.Â  This would require speculation as to subsequent applications.Â  Id.Â  Moreover, any such duty is fulfilled by the sophisticated intermediary rule.Â  Under this rule, a component supplier is not required to provide a warning to end users if it is reasonable for the supplier to rely on the buyer to take precautions to protect end users.Â  Id. at 1240-41.Â  The same rule applies when the buyer is a large employer that knows or should know of the dangers to its employees inherent in the supplies it purchases.Â  Bragg v. Hi-Ranger, Inc., 319 S.C. 531, 550, 462 S.E.2d 321, 332 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  Rheem was a manufacturer of water heaters that was familiar with the need for a failsafe mechanism for its damper, and Honeywell reasonably relied on Rheem to provide an adequate warning to end users.Â  Accordingly, we hold that Appellantsâ€™ failure to warn claim fails as a matter of law.\r\nC. Express or Implied Warranty\r\nOur finding that the M892 was not defective disposes of Appellantsâ€™ warranty claims also.Â  Appellants assert that certification of the D892 with the AGA created an express warranty covering the M892 without providing any legal support for their theory whatsoever.[5]Â  The express warranty provided with the M892 was factually inapposite.Â  We note that the express warranty specifically and conspicuously disclaimed all other express or implied warranties as required by South Carolina Code section 36-2-316.Â  Appellantsâ€™ argument that section 36-2-318 prevents disclaimer of warranties is also without merit.Â  The reportersâ€™ comments to section 36-2-318 make clear that this section does not prevent disclaimers but is instead intended to abolish the privity defense.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-318, official cmt. 1 (2003).Â  Therefore, summary judgment for Honeywell on this issue was proper.\r\nD. Negligence\r\nLiability for negligence requires Appellants to show that Honeywell breached its duty to use due care in adopting a safe design.Â  Allen at 426, 505 S.E.2d at 356.Â  The trial court correctly found that Appellants failed to demonstrate that Honeywell had any knowledge of a problem with its M892 motor.Â  Honeywellâ€™s statement that it had no prior claims filed against it involving the M892 went unchallenged.Â  See Oglesby v. General Motors Corp., 190 F.3d 244, 252 (4th Cir. 1999) (finding summary judgment on the issue of negligence appropriate under South Carolina law when defendantâ€™s statement that it had no prior claims involving the part at issue went unchallenged).Â  In addition, Appellantsâ€™ expert admitted that the M892 by itself was safe, and there is no evidence that the unit in question failed.\r\nAppellants further argue that subsequent modification does not preclude liability for the manufacturer.Â  However, the cases Appellants cite all involve situations in which the product was defective prior to the alteration.Â  See Small v. Pioneer Mach., Inc., 329 S.C. 448, 466, 494 S.E.2d 835, 844 (Ct. App. 1997) (finding that subsequent modifications did not causally contribute to the injury); Fleming v. Borden, Inc., 316 S.C. 452, 457, 450 S.E.2d 589, 592 (1994) (finding modification foreseeable because of defective design).Â  Subsequent modification cannot be used to impose liability on the manufacturer of a non-defective product. \r\nE. Proximate Cause\r\nAppellantsâ€™ product liability claims also fail because they cannot prove proximate cause.Â  Proximate cause is an essential element in products liability claims, whether brought under strict liability, negligence, or warranty theories.Â  Small at 463, 494 S.E.2d at 842.Â  Proximate cause requires proof of both causation in fact and legal causation.Â  Causation in fact is proven by establishing the injury would not have occurred â€œbut forâ€ the defendantâ€™s negligence.Â  Legal cause is proven by establishing foreseeability.Â  Id. \r\nIn this case, Appellants cannot show that Honeywellâ€™s actions were a â€œbut forâ€ cause of their injuries.Â  The trial court found that Honeywellâ€™s motor was disconnected from the damper assembly at the time the incident occurred.Â  Although on a summary judgment motion we must take all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, we find no evidence contradicting the trial judgeâ€™s finding.Â  \r\nThe only evidence Appellants offer in opposition is the ambiguous testimony of one of their experts, who testified that the damper had been disconnected â€œ[w]ithin a couple hours of the incident.â€Â  Appellants contend that their expert intended to say that the damper was disconnected from the motor after the accident.Â  However, the testimony of their expert that the half-open position of the damper caused the incident indicates that he meant the damper was disconnected before the incident occurred.Â  Another of Appellantsâ€™ experts testified that the disconnected damper would have eventually created a problem, but did not on this occasion because other factors caused the carbon monoxide buildup on the date in question.Â  \r\nIntentionally disconnecting a safety feature breaks any causal link.Â  See Young v. Tide Craft, Inc., 270 S.C. 453, 242 S.E.2d 671 (1978) (holding that the boat manufacturer was not liable because a mechanicâ€™s action in splicing a steering cable broke the causal link); see also 63 Am. Jur. 2d Products Liability Â§ 39 (2004) (stating that a manufacturer is not liable when a third partyâ€™s alteration of the product amounts to a superceding cause of the injury).Â  No evidence suggests the damper was disconnected due to any problem with the motor.Â  Therefore, summary judgment was proper because Appellants cannot show proximate cause.[6]\r\nII. Unfair Trade Practices Claim\r\nAppellants next assert that the trial court erred in granting Honeywellâ€™s motion for summary judgment on their Unfair Trade Practices claim.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nUnder the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA), any person suffering an ascertainable loss of money or real or personal property as a result of a defendantâ€™s unfair or deceptive practices may bring an action for damages.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-140 (1985).Â  In order to recover under UTPA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) the defendant engaged in an unlawful trade practice; (2) the plaintiff suffered actual, ascertainable damages as a result of the defendantâ€™s use of the unlawful trade practice; and (3) the unlawful trade practice had an adverse impact on the public interest.Â  Id.; see also section 39-5-20.Â  An act is unfair under the UTPA when it is offensive to public policy or when it is immoral, unethical, or oppressive, and a deceptive practice is one that has a tendency to deceive.Â  Johnson v. Collins Enter. Co., Inc., 349 S.C. 613, 636, 564 S.E.2d 653, 665 (2002).Â  \r\nThe trial court properly granted summary judgment on Appellantsâ€™ UTPA claim.Â  There is no evidence of any immoral, unethical or oppressive conduct by Honeywell, or of any act tending to deceive.Â  The M892 was not defective and there is no evidence of any attempt to misrepresent its compliance with safety standards.Â  The fact that the AGA agreed to certify Rheemâ€™s damper using test data from Honeywellâ€™s certification of the D892 does not equate to a deceptive or unfair practice by Honeywell.Â  Moreover, since the Appellants cannot show evidence of repetition, there can be no adverse public impact.Â  No claims regarding the M892 have been filed prior to this case and Honeywell no longer manufactures this part.Â  \r\nIII. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress Claim\r\nThe trial court also properly granted summary judgment for Honeywell on Appellantsâ€™ intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.Â  The requirements for establishment of the tort are: \r\n\r\n  (1) the defendant intentionally or recklessly inflicted severe emotional distress, or knew that distress would probably result from his conduct; (2) the defendantâ€™s conduct was so extreme and outrageous that it exceeded all possible bounds of decency and was furthermore atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community; (3) the actions of the defendant caused the plaintiffâ€™s emotional distress; and (4) the emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff was so severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it. \r\n\r\nGattison v. S.C. State College, 318 S.C. 148, 151-52, 456 S.E.2d 414, 416 (Ct. App. 1995).Â Â  A judge should not submit a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress to the jury unless reasonable persons might differ on the issue.Â  Id.Â  Even unprofessional, inappropriate behavior by a defendant is insufficient.Â  Id. at 157, 456 S.E.2d at 419.\r\nThere is no evidence of any unprofessional or inappropriate behavior by Honeywell, much less conduct so extreme and outrageous as to exceed all possible bounds of decency.Â  Accordingly, we affirm on this issue as well. \r\nIV. Recusal of the Trial Judge\r\nFinally, Appellants argue that the trial judge should have recused himself.Â  A trial judgeâ€™s refusal to disqualify himself will not be reversed on appeal absent evidence of judicial prejudice.Â  State v. Cheatham, 349 S.C. 101, 111, 561 S.E.2d 618, 624 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œIt is not enough for a party seeking disqualification to simply allege bias. Â The party must show some evidence of bias.Â  Furthermore, the alleged bias must be personal, as distinguished from judicial, in nature.â€Â  Id. (citations omitted). \r\nCounsel for Appellants assert that the trial judge showed a lack of judicial decorum and open hostility toward her during the motions hearing held on September 24, 2002.Â  At that hearing, which was held the day before the deadline for the fourth scheduling order, counsel for Appellants had moved to compel certain discovery.Â  Appellantsâ€™ counsel believed that Honeywell and Rheem were â€œin bed togetherâ€ and demanded repeatedly that Honeywell produce documents to substantiate this theory.Â  The trial judge found that all of the records that existed had already been produced.Â  Appellantsâ€™ counsel had requested information about â€œcomponent partsâ€ of the M892, apparently confounding the M892 with the D892, which was not used in Rheemâ€™s damper assembly.Â  The trial judge explained this to Appellantâ€™s counsel and denied the motion.Â  Nonetheless, Honeywell was ordered to produce any relevant records that had not yet been produced.Â  \r\nÂ We find no evidence of personal or prejudicial bias in the record.Â  The trial judge simply sought to prevent waste of judicial resources by cutting short Appellantsâ€™ counselâ€™s continued efforts to make arguments that were clearly based on a misapprehension of the facts.Â  The trial judge informed Appellantsâ€™ counsel that he had carefully reviewed the documents before making the ruling.Â  We note that the trial judge even attempted to reconcile any hard feelings produced as a result of this exchange.Â  \r\nWe hold that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Appellantsâ€™ motion to recuse.Â  We have reviewed Appellantsâ€™ remaining grounds for appeal and find them to be without merit. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We hold that Appellants have failed to establish a products liability claim.Â  The M892 was not defective, and we decline to impose liability on a component manufacturer for design defects in the products into which component parts are incorporated.Â  Additionally, Honeywellâ€™s warning was adequate and, in any case, any duty to warn was fulfilled when Rheem, a sophisticated purchaser, received notice of the need for a return mechanism.Â  Moreover, Appellants cannot show proximate cause on any of their products liability claims.Â  Appellantsâ€™ warranty and negligence claims are without merit.Â  Likewise, the UTPA and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims lack any support from the record.Â  Summary judgment for Honeywell was therefore proper.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nANDERSON, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Appellants erroneously assert that the M892 required a return spring as a failsafe mechanism.Â  The D892 damper assembly utilized a return spring.Â  The M892 was simply a motor (the actuator motor from the D892 damper assembly, sold separately) which Rheem bought and incorporated into its damper design.Â Â  \r\n[3] The test results demonstrated the presence of carbon monoxide in rooms 228-233 and 128-137.Â  Of the Appellants, only two were in rooms testing positive for carbon monoxide at the time of the incident. \r\n[4] This expert attempted to disclaim this admission in a later deposition.Â  However, the disclaimer is ineffective because it essentially offers a legal opinion that Honeywellâ€™s participation in Rheemâ€™s final damper renders Honeywell liable.Â  See Kirkland v. Peoples Gas Co., 269 S.C. 431, 434, 237 S.E.2d 772, 773 (1977) (excluding expert testimony as to issues of law). \r\n[5] Appellants also assert that Rheemâ€™s certification of compliance sticker on the water heater created an express warranty by Honeywell.Â  Appellants offer no legal basis for this theory. \r\n[6] We also note that Appellantsâ€™ expert testimony offered to show exposure to carbon monoxide was based on speculation rather than hard test data.Â  None of the experts had actually visited the site of the incident.Â  Thus, Appellants have failed to demonstrate proximate cause for this reason also.Â  See Oglesby at 249 (â€œ[A] plaintiff may not prevail in a products liability case by relying on the opinion of an expert unsupported by any evidence such as test data or relevant literature in the field.â€).Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-321","title":"Ramsey v.

Patrick Yon, of Anderson, for Appellant-Respondent.\r\nJ. Franklin McClain, of Anderson, and Roxy Rae Beagley, of Clemson, for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this cross appeal, Russell Wayne Ramsey (Father) appeals the family courtâ€™s order modifying visitation with his children.Â  Dana Rice Ramsey (Mother) appeals the portion of the family courtâ€™s order awarding Father extensive visitation, requiring Mother to reimburse Fatherâ€™s travel expenses, suspending Fatherâ€™s child support obligation during summer visitation, and denying Mother attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.[1]Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1999, Mother and Father divorced.Â  The parties reached a voluntary agreement regarding custody of their two children, Travis and Lauren, which the family court incorporated into its order.Â  The agreement granted Mother primary custody of the children, and granted Father specific visitation that included alternate weekends, holidays, spring breaks, and two afternoons each weekday from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.Â  \r\nIn June 2001, Mother moved with the children from Anderson to Bluffton.Â  Prior to moving, Mother sent Father several letters indicating her desire to be closer to her parents in part because her father had reoccurring bladder cancer.Â  Mother offered Father additional visitation with the children to compensate for the four hours of midweek visitation that would be impossible due to the distance.Â  Father refused to modify the midweek visitation schedule, so Mother filed this action to modify the visitation order.Â  Father answered and counterclaimed for custody of the two children plus attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nBy final order, the family court denied Fatherâ€™s request for custody of the children, and modified the visitation schedule to accommodate Motherâ€™s move to Bluffton.Â  The family court increased Fatherâ€™s summer visitation from three weeks to five weeks, permitted three of the weeks to be consecutive, and eliminated Fatherâ€™s support obligation during these five weeks.Â  The family court further provided that Father could visit the children in Bluffton whenever he wished as long as he provided Mother with at least ten days advance notice, and ordered that Mother â€œshall fully cooperate in accommodating this visitation request.â€Â  In order to defray Fatherâ€™s travel expenses if he stayed in a hotel while in Bluffton, the family court ordered Mother to reimburse Father $50 per day for a maximum of $150.Â  This cross-appeal follows.Â  \r\n&nbsp;STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, we have jurisdiction to find the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Bannen v. Bannen, 286 S.C. 24, 26, 331 S.E.2d 379, 380 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â Â  Nor must we ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 328, 526 S.E.2d 241, 245 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  In the absence of a clear abuse of discretion, the trial courtâ€™s order limiting visitation rights will not be disturbed on appeal. Nash v. Byrd, 298 S.C. 530, 536, 381 S.E.2d 913, 916 (Ct. App. 1989)\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Fatherâ€™s Appeal\r\nFather argues the family court erred in modifying the prior custody order by changing Fatherâ€™s visitation schedule without making a specific finding of fact that a change in circumstances had occurred subsequent to the entry of the original order and in finding the move to Bluffton was in the childrenâ€™s best interests.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe controlling consideration when awarding visitation, is the welfare and best interest of the child.Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 12, 471 S.E.2d 154, 158 (1996).Â  The guiding standard for modification for visitation is whether or not a change in circumstances occurred subsequent to the entry of the decree.Â  Ingold v. Ingold, 304 S.C. 316, 320, 404 S.E.2d 35, 37 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  â€œA change in circumstances justifying a change in visitation of a child simply means that sufficient facts have been shown to warrant the conclusion that the best interests of the child would be served by the change.â€Â  Pitt v. Olds, 333 S.C. 478, 481, 511 S.E.2d 60, 61 (1999).Â Â  Additionally, â€œthe court may not issue an order which prohibits a custodial parent from moving his residence to a location within the State unless the court finds a compelling reason or unless the parties have agreed to such a prohibition.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(30) (Supp. 2004).Â  \r\nAlthough the court did not make a specific finding that a material change in circumstances had occurred to warrant modifying the visitation order, the family courtâ€™s order clearly changed Fatherâ€™s visitation because Motherâ€™s move to Bluffton with the children made the midweek visitation impossible.Â  Father argues Motherâ€™s knowledge that her father was suffering from reoccurring bouts of bladder cancer prior to the parties divorce prevents a finding the change in circumstances occurred subsequent to the entry of the original visitation order.Â  However, Mother testified she contemplated moving to Bluffton only after the divorce to help with her fatherâ€™s care and because she began to feel â€œaloneâ€ as she had no family in the area.Â  Moreover, the substantial change in circumstances, Motherâ€™s move with the children to Bluffton, occurred more than a year after the entry of the decree. Â Â Â Â \r\nAdditionally, the family court made extensive findings in determining the move to Bluffton and subsequent modification of the visitation order was in the childrenâ€™s best interests.Â  The court found Motherâ€™s testimony and the guardian ad litemâ€™s report credible.Â  Mother indicated the children were excelling in school, participating in extracurricular activities, developing a wide circle of new friends, and experienced no negative effects due to the move to Buffton.Â  The guardian ad litem reported the children â€œwere happy in Blufftonâ€ and appeared â€œto be thriving in their current environment.â€Â  Mother has a greater income in Bluffton and a wide network of support from friends and family.Â  The family court found the move improved the general quality of life for Mother and the children.Â  Based upon the evidence presented in this case, we conclude the family court did not abuse its discretion in finding the move to Bluffton was in the childrenâ€™s best interests.Â  Accordingly, we find no error in the family courtâ€™s decision to modify the visitation order.Â Â Â Â  \r\nII.Â  Motherâ€™s appeal\r\nMother argues the family court erred by modifying the visitation schedule to allow Father to visit the children in Bluffton whenever he wished as long as he provided Mother with at least ten days advance notice.Â  We remand this issue.\r\nâ€œThe issue of visitation is within the sound discretion of the family court and its findings will not be disturbed absent an abuse of that discretion.â€ Hyde v. Hyde, 302 S.C. 280, 281, 395 S.E.2d 186, 187 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  At the hearing, Father testified the loss of his weekday visitation prevented him from spending quality time with the children and from being involved in their day-to-day lives.Â  Before the children moved to Bluffton, Father picked the children up from school, attended baseball games, and took the children to the library or the park during the week.Â  In an attempt to foster an enduring father-child relationship in spite of the geographical distance, the family court provided Father with the opportunity to spend extended time with the children.Â  The family court ordered:\r\n\r\nIn the event the father wishes to travel to Bluffton, South Carolina to visit with the children (a) during periods other than those designated above, or (b) during these designated holiday periods, he shall provide the mother with at least 10 days advance notice of his intentions, and the mother shall fully cooperate in accommodating this visitation request.\r\n\r\nAlthough we understand the family courtâ€™s intent in awarding Father additional visitation, we find the language of the order is not specific enough for us to determine whether the decision constituted an abuse of discretion.Â  Therefore, we remand the issue to the family court for a more definite ruling, including a more explicit statement regarding when Father may visit and how he must give notice.\r\nMother argues the family court erred by requiring Mother to reimburse Father at the rate of $50 per day with a maximum of $150 anytime he wishes to travel to Bluffton to exercise visitation.Â  We agree.\r\nOur review of the record indicates Father has sufficient income to pay for any travel expenses incurred by exercising his visitation rights.Â  Father has a gross monthly income of $3,680.85, and Mother has a gross monthly income of $2,463.Â  Mother facilitated Fatherâ€™s visitation by exchanging the children at a halfway point between Bluffton and Anderson, and her parents offered to vacate their home so Father may stay there when he wishes to spend the night in Bluffton.Â  Mother also paid for the children to fly to Anderson to visit Father.Â  Moreover, the family court found although â€œFather testified that this current visitation arrangement has been financially taxing on him . . . both parties have the financial wherewithal to pay for any transportation costs.â€Â  Based upon these facts, we find the family court erred in ordering Mother to pay Fatherâ€™s travel expenses.Â Â Â Â  \r\nMother contends the family court erred by expanding Fatherâ€™s summer visitation from three weeks to five weeks and providing that three of the five weeks could be consecutive.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAs iterated above, the paramount consideration when awarding visitation is the best interest of the child, and the family courtâ€™s findings will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Woodall at 12, 471 S.E.2d at 154.Â  At the hearing before the family court, Father testified the loss of his weekday visitation had affected his relationship with his children.Â  Father also testified his weekend visitation was adversely affected when the children moved because he spent approximately three hours driving the children to and from Anderson.Â  We agree with the family courtâ€™s finding it is impossible to foresee whether any visitation arrangement will be successful in maintaining a successful relationship between Father and the children.Â  As such, we find no abuse of discretion in the family courtâ€™s decision to expand Fatherâ€™s summer visitation so he can spend quality time with the children.\r\nMother argues the family court erred by suspending Fatherâ€™s child support obligation during his five weeks of summer visitation.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œChild support decisions are addressed to the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Engle v. Engle, 343 S.C. 444, 448, 539 S.E.2d 712, 714 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  In the case sub judice, the family court suspended Fatherâ€™s child support obligation only during the summer visitation period.Â  Because the children will visit with Father for an extended period of time, Mother will be relieved of expenses she would typically incur for food and other incidentals.Â  Additionally, the family court is within its discretion to adjust Fatherâ€™s child support obligation to help offset the higher cost of exercising visitation.Â  See Rice v. Rice, 335 S.C. 449, 466, 517 S.E.2d 220, 229 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the family courtâ€™s decision to shift expenses to Father by suspending his child support payments during the summer visitation.Â  \r\nMother argues the family court erred by failing to award her attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œOrdinarily, the award of attorney fees lies within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.â€ McElveen v. McElveen, 332 S.C. 583, 601, 506 S.E.2d 1, 10 (Ct. App. 1998). The factors to be considered in awarding reasonable attorney fees and costs include: (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) the professional standing of counsel; (4) the contingency of compensation; (5) the beneficial results obtained; and (6) the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).Â  In deciding whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court should consider the partiesâ€™ ability to pay their own fees, the beneficial results obtained by counsel, the respective financial conditions of the parties, and the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).\r\nMother argues the family court should have awarded attorneyâ€™s fees to her because she attempted to negotiate a settlement with Father prior to filling the action, she obtained beneficial results, and Father had a greater ability to pay the fee.Â  However, Mother and Father each achieved beneficial results, and each party had the ability to pay his or her own fees.Â  Therefore, we find no abuse of discretion in the family courtâ€™s decision to deny attorneyâ€™s fees to both parties.Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the family courtâ€™s decision to modify the visitation order.Â  However, we remand the portion of the order granting Father unlimited visitation rights for a more definite statement of the partiesâ€™ respective rights and responsibilities, and reverse the portion of the order requiring Mother to pay Fatherâ€™s travel expenses.Â  We affirm the family courtâ€™s decision to award Father five weeks of summer visitation and to suspend his child support obligation during that time.Â  Additionally, we find no abuse of discretion in the family courtâ€™s decision to deny Mother attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.Â Â Â  \r\nANDERSON, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-322","title":"Chisolm v.

Porter, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nWilliam B. Chisholm, of Greenville, Pro Se Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Susan Chisholm appeals a family court order reversing a previous order, which required that William Chisholmâ€™s child support payments be paid through the court.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nWilliam and Susan Chisholm were divorced by order of Judge R. Kinard Johnson, Jr., dated April 4, 2003.Â  William was ordered to make child support payments in the amount of $173.54 per week.Â  The order also stated, â€œIn the event the Father is late by more than three (3) days, then upon Affidavit of Mother, all future payments shall be made through the Family Court with the imposition of 5% court costs.â€Â  On October 28, 2003, Susan swore out an affidavit stating William had failed to pay child support as ordered and had been late by more than three days.Â  She then requested all future payments be made through the family court.Â  The next day, Susanâ€™s attorney sent a letter to Williamâ€™s attorney complaining that William had not paid child support due on October 17, 2003 and that he had deducted $32.81 from the child support payment due on October 24, 2003.Â  The letter further specified that counsel would proceed with a contempt action on the delinquent payment and improper deduction if they were not paid within five days.Â  It is uncontested that William then paid the amount of the deduction and another complete child support payment.Â  However, William contends he had previously attempted to pay the October 17, 2003 payment by delivering a check to Susanâ€™s residence.Â  \r\nOn October 30, 2003, based solely upon the affidavit, Judge Robert Jenkins ordered child support payments be made through the family court.Â  However, after hearing a motion for relief pursuant to Rule 60, SCRCP, the court reversed.Â  On January 13, 2004, the court found it was neither necessary nor equitable to require payment be made through the family court.Â  Judge Jenkins determined that either the payment was not late, or else it was excusable.Â  Therefore, he set aside his own order of October 30, 2003.Â  Susan appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, we may find facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Emery v. Smith, 361 S.C. 207, 213, 603 S.E.2d 598, 601 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002); Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 202, 522 S.E.2d 835, 838 (Ct. App. 1999). Nor must a reviewing court ignore the fact the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 328, 526 S.E.2d 241, 245 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nLAW AND DISCUSSION\r\nSusan argues the family court erred by vacating the order requiring payment through the family court and by failing to award attorney fees.Â  We disagree.\r\nSusan points to language in the divorce decree that clearly and unambiguously states if William is late in child support payments by more than three days, upon motion of Susan, all future payments must be made through the family court.Â  She argues Judge Jenkinsâ€™ actions impermissibly modified this language in violation of the long standing rule that one judge may not overrule another judge of the same court.Â  See Charleston County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Father, 317 S.C. 283, 288, 454 S.E.2d 307, 310 (1995).Â  \r\nInitially, we note that Judge Jenkins did not overrule Judge Johnsonâ€™s divorce order.Â  Rather, Judge Jenkins found the disputed payment either was not late or was excusable.Â  Thus, through the order dated January 13, 2004, Judge Jenkins set aside his own previous order of October 30, 2003, which had required William to make child support payments through the court. \r\nA review of the record shows that William contended he did pay the child support due October 17, 2003 within the allowed time.Â  Additionally, when it was brought to his attention that Susan did not receive the check, he corrected the problem.Â  Any delay might be attributed to Susan, as she apparently would not allow William to give her the check directly, but â€œpreferred [he] place the child support check in a zip lock sandwich bag, with a weight, and throw it toward the front of [Susanâ€™s] residence.â€Â  The peculiarity of this manner of delivery required by Susan made a lost child support payment almost inevitable.Â  \r\nThe other failure is the fact William deducted amounts totaling $32.81, which he directly paid for the support of his child, from the child support payment.Â  When Susan, through counsel, objected to this deduction, William promptly paid this amount.Â  Though this deduction was in error, it seems to have simply been a misunderstanding, which was subsequently corrected.Â  The family court deemed it unduly harsh to require payment through the court and the required a 5% handling fee, based solely on a deduction that was promptly corrected.\r\nThe family court specifically found no indication of previous delinquencies and no credible indication that child support payments needed to be paid through the court for them to be paid properly.Â  As the trial court said, the issue of the October 17, 2003 payment is â€œsimply one partyâ€™s statement versus that of the other party.â€Â  We do not find error in the family courtâ€™s refusal to require payment through the court for what was at most a technical violation that was corrected when brought to Williamâ€™s attention.\r\nAccordingly, we affirm Judge Jenkinsâ€™ order of January 13, 2004, which set aside his previous order of October 30, 2003.Â  The provisions of the original divorce decree remain in full force and effect and are not modified by either of Judge Jenkinsâ€™ orders, or by this opinion.Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons discussed above, the order of the family court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, STILWELL, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-323","title":"State v.

Newman, Jr. and Andrew E. Haselden, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this workersâ€™ compensation action, the single commissioner determined that Thomas P. Bush was permanently and totally disabled as a result of an on-the-job injury to his back.Â  An appellate panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (the commission) reversed the finding of the single commissioner, holding Bush was entitled only to a twenty percent permanent partial disability.Â  The circuit court affirmed, and Bush appeals.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThomas P. Bush injured his back during the course and scope of his employment as a heavy equipment mechanic with Pioneer Machinery on January 12, 2001.[2]Â  Bush sought treatment at Doctorâ€™s Care on January 16, 2001, complaining of resulting back and leg pain.Â  The attending doctor diagnosed Bush as suffering from a â€œlumbar strainâ€ and prescribed physical therapy and pain medication.Â  Bush returned to work the following day.Â  \r\nBush subsequently sought treatment at Midlands Orthopedics.Â  After evaluating an MRI, Dr. David Redmond diagnosed Bush as having a â€œwork-related injury with compression fracture L3 in a gentlemen with probably [sic] osteoporosis associated with steroid use in treatment of ulcerative colitisâ€ and determined Bush was able to perform â€œlight dutyâ€ work.Â  Dr. Ross Lynch, also of Midlands Orthopedics, separately examined Bush diagnosing â€œa compression fracture L3 minimal, probably steroid inducedâ€ and possible osteoporosis.Â  Dr. Lynch recommended a bone density test.Â  After the results of the bone density test, Dr. Lynch reaffirmed his diagnosis as â€œa compression fracture L3 minimal, probably steroid induced.â€Â  \r\nAfter approximately eight months of treatment, Dr. Redmond released Bush at maximum medical improvement.Â  He assigned Bush a 5% whole person impairment rating with a 25% impairment rating to his spine.Â  Moreover, Dr. Redmond noted Bush was able to perform at light physical capacity level and could work with restrictions.Â  After Dr. Redmond released Bush, Dr. Lynch converted the whole person permanent rating to 6.6% and noted because of Bushâ€™s osteoporosis, â€œa permanent light duty status is probably best for him.â€ \r\nAt the hearing, Bush countered the testimony of Dr. Redmond and Dr. Lynch with a non-physician counselor, Dr. William Stewart, in support of his contention of permanent total disability.Â  Dr. Stewart testified no â€œreasonable stable market exists or will exist for the types of services Mr. Bush is physically, educationally, or vocationally capable of performing/providing.â€Â  Based on this testimony, the single commissioner awarded Bush permanent total disability benefits.Â  \r\nThe commission reversed, finding the evidence only supported a finding that Bushâ€™s work-related injuries were limited to a lumbar strain and that the compression fracture at L3 was not caused by the work-related injury but rather was caused by osteoporosis resulting from his steroid use for treatment of his ulcerative colitis.Â  The circuit court affirmed the commission.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBush alleges the circuit court and commission erred in reversing the single commissionerâ€™s finding that he is permanently and totally disabled as a result of the work-related injury of January 12, 2001.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act applies to appeals from decisions of the commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  In an appeal from the commission, neither this court nor the circuit court may substitute its judgment for that of the commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact but may reverse when the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 617, 571 S.E.2d 92, 95 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œAny review of the commissionâ€™s factual findings is governed by the substantial evidence standard.â€Â  Lockridge v. Santens of Am., Inc., 344 S.C. 511, 515, 544 S.E.2d 842, 844 (Ct.

We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Griffins purchased real estate from White Oak and McDonald for $122,000.Â  The property was to be used as a residence by Jacquelyn and Michael Burke, their daughter and son-in-law.Â  Shortly after moving into the home, the Burkes noticed certain defects, including a defective foundation.Â  Purchasers sued Sellers, and Home Shop Realty, a real estate brokerage firm, alleging breach of the contract for sale, fraud, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, negligent misrepresentation, civil conspiracy, and a violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act.Â  \r\nThe causes of action were submitted to the jury through a special verdict form.Â  The jury denied all of Purchasersâ€™ causes of action, except breach of contract.Â  Through the special verdict form, the jury found Sellers breached the contract for the purchase of the home and that Sellers should take the home back and return the purchase money to Purchasers.Â  The jury did not award any other damages.Â  \r\nPurchasers filed a motion for attorneyâ€™s fees, alleging that the contract for sale provided for â€œreasonable attorneyâ€™s fees.â€Â  They alleged that their attorney â€œhandled the proceeding under a contingency agreement and one-third of the award under the verdict (the return of the $122,000 purchase money for the home),â€ $40,626, would be reasonable.Â  At the hearing, Sellers argued that a contingency agreement was unreasonable because the jury awarded rescission and therefore, no damages were awarded.Â  Sellers also asked the court to carefully examine the attorneyâ€™s fees based on the amount of time and items charged by Purchasersâ€™ counsel because â€œwe just feel like that [sic] itâ€™s exorbitant.â€Â  \r\nThrough an â€œOrder Dealing with Post-trial Motions,â€ the trial judge granted Purchasersâ€™ motion for attorneyâ€™s fees in the amount of $40,626.Â  Sellers filed a Rule 59(e) motion, arguing the award based on a contingency fee was unreasonable because Purchasers did not recover $122,000.Â  In their motion, Sellers also urged the court to award fees based on the hourly rate submitted by Purchasersâ€™ counsel, including only fees â€œwhich can be specifically accounted forâ€ and â€œdeemed appropriate.â€Â  The trial judge made no ruling on Sellersâ€™ Rule 59(e) motion.Â  Sellers appeal the award of attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSellers concede Purchasers were entitled to an award of attorneyâ€™s fees, but challenge the award as excessive.Â  Specifically, they argue the award was excessive considering the remedy the jury provided to Purchasers.Â  While the jury found in favor of Purchasers on the breach of contract cause of action, the jury specifically stated that no damages were awarded and found Sellers must take the home back and return the purchase money to Purchasers.Â  Thus, the juryâ€™s verdict left the parties in the same position they were in prior to the sale.Â  We agree with Sellers, and find the trial judgeâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees based on the contingency fee agreement to be excessive.Â  \r\nâ€œThe amount of attorneyâ€™s fees to be awarded in a particular case is within the discretion of the trial judge provided the award is reasonable.â€\r\n    Baron Data Systems, Inc. v. Loter,&nbsp; 297 S.C. 382, 385-86, 377 S.E.2d 296, 298&nbsp;(1989).Â  In determining a reasonable award of attorneyâ€™s fees, the court should consider the following factors: â€œ1) nature, extent, and difficulty of the legal services rendered; 2) time and labor devoted to the case; 3) professional standing of counsel; 4) contingency of compensation; 5) fee customarily charged in the locality for similar services; and 6) beneficial results obtained.â€Â  Blumberg v. Nealco, Inc.,&nbsp; 310 S.C. 492, 494, 427 S.E.2d 659, 660&nbsp;(1993).Â  The court should also make specific findings of fact on the record for each of the factors.Â  Id. at 494, 427 S.E.2d at 661.Â  â€œOn appeal, absent sufficient evidentiary support on the record for each factor, the award should be reversed and the issue remanded for the trial court to make specific findings of fact.â€Â  Id.  \r\nIn this case, the trial judge considered each of the Blumberg factors, and set forth specific findings of fact on the record.Â  Sufficient evidence exists in the record to support the judgeâ€™s findings on all of the factors except for the beneficial results obtained.\r\nIn deciding the beneficial results obtained, the trial judge concluded that Purchasers were successful in securing their purchase money back and determined that the recovery was $122,000, the purchase price of the home.Â  Sellers argue this overstated the beneficial results obtained because even though Purchasers recovered the purchase price, they also had to return the home to Sellers.Â  Sellers assert that the amount of recovery was actually $122,000 less the value of the home, and argue the only evidence in the record was that the home was worth $131,000.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe remedy the jury chose to afford Purchasers requires them to return the home to Sellers in exchange for the purchase price of $122,000.Â  The only evidence in the record demonstrates that the home was appraised in December of 2000 for $131,000.Â  Therefore, the remedy did not provide Purchasers a recovery of $122,000, but instead placed them back in the same position they were in prior to entering the contract.Â Â Â  Thus, while we find evidence in the record to support a finding that Purchasers were successful in obtaining a rescission of their contract, we find no evidence to support reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees based on the Purchaserâ€™s contingency fee agreement with their attorney.\r\nWe hold the judge erred in awarding $40,626 in attorneyâ€™s fees, and reverse the award of fees to the extent it is based on the contingency agreement.Â Â  See Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 308, 486 S.E.2d 750, 759&nbsp;(1997) (stating that the contract between the client and counsel does not control the determination of reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees).Â  Rather, we find an award of attorneyâ€™s fees in the amount of $26.507.06,[1] the amount submitted by Purchasersâ€™ counsel in his invoice of professional services and bolstered with his affidavit in support of attorneyâ€™s fees, to be a reasonable award of attorneyâ€™s fees. Id.Â  See also Columbia (S.C.) Teachers Federal Credit Union v. Newsome Chevrolet-Buick, 303 S.C. 162, 165-66, 399 S.E.2d 444, 447 (Ct. App. 1990) (affirming an award of attorneyâ€™s fees based upon an hourly rate even though agreement with client was contingency-based).\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nGOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Sellers argue on appeal that certain services rendered by paralegals and secretaries should not be included in an award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We find this issue is not preserved for appeal.Â  â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke,&nbsp; 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733&nbsp;(1998) (citation omitted).Â  At the hearing, the only objection Sellers made to the invoice of Purchasersâ€™ counsel was that it was exorbitant and should be closely examined.Â  Moreover, any issues raised regarding the attorneyâ€™s fees in the Rule 59(e) motion by Sellers were never ruled upon by the trial judge.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-338","title":"State v.

I ought to take you upstairs and f--- you myself.â€Â  In November 1999, Hansson was called into Scaliseâ€™s office.Â  Scalise said, â€œYouâ€™ve got a nice house; nice car; nice wife. . . . Youâ€™re starting to get under my skin.â€Â  The two talked and, at the end of the conversation, with a co-worker present, Scalise â€œgoosedâ€ Hansson, by sticking his finger in Hanssonâ€™s clothed anus. \r\nAccording to John Goodhart, a former supervisor of Hansson at Scalise Builders, the comments were jokesâ€”jokes of the variety Hansson admits are normal at construction sites.Â  In fact, Hansson himself joked by carrying around a dollâ€™s head in his hand and asking co-workers, â€œDo you want a little head?â€Â  Hansson admitted that he often used profanity and was not offended by such language.Â  When asked if he had ever complained to a supervisor, Hansson testified the supervisor was usually present and knew what was happening.Â  He also testified he thought telling Scalise he was offended was fruitless; he â€œ[d]idnâ€™t think it would do any goodâ€ and â€œ[j]ust figured it was the way it was.â€Â  He testified one Scalise employee, a painter working in a different area, harassed him on a weekly basis and sometimes called him names on a daily basis.Â  However, Hansson testified he did not leave his job because he liked what he was doing and â€œ99% of the time nobody botheredâ€ him.Â  \r\nHansson did not see a doctor or counselor for the mental anguish he claims to have suffered.Â  He did not lose time from work or experience effects on his marital relationship or ability to work.Â  However, Hansson implicitly claimed the harassment at work caused him to grit his teeth at night, for which he saw a dentist â€œonce or twice.â€Â  It also caused him to wake up repeatedly at night for about one year.Â  He resigned from Scalise Builders in March or April 2000 because of the harassment and to start his own business.Â  \r\nAfter resigning, Hansson sued Scalise and Scalise Builders for intentional infliction of emotional distress, breach of contract, slander, and wrongful retention of wages.Â  Scalise and Scalise Builders filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted.Â  Hansson appealed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe appellate court reviews a grant of summary judgment under the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56, SCRCP.â€ Lanham v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of South Carolina, 349 S.C. 356, 361, 563 S.E.2d 331, 333 (2002).Â  Granting summary judgment is proper when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Id.Â  Where the parties dispute the conclusions to be drawn from undisputed facts, summary judgment is improper.Â  Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997).Â  When making this determination, the court should view the evidence and all inferences that can be drawn reasonably therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Lanham, 349 S.C. at 361-62, 563 S.E.2d at 333. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHansson argues the trial court erred in finding no genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the conduct in question was outrageous in his intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nTo recover for an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, the plaintiff must show: \r\n\r\n(1) the defendant intentionally or recklessly inflicted severe emotional distress or was certain or substantially certain that such distress would result from his conduct . . .; (2) the conduct was so â€œextreme and outrageousâ€ as to exceed â€œall possible bounds of decencyâ€ and must be regarded as â€˜atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized communityâ€™ . . .; (3) the actions of the defendant caused the plaintiffâ€™s emotional distress; and (4) the emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff was â€œsevereâ€ so that â€œno reasonable man could be expected to endure it.â€\r\n\r\nFolkens v. Hunt, 290 S.C. 194, 203, 348 S.E.2d 839, 844 (Ct. App. 1986) (quoting Ford v. Hutson, 276 S.C. 157, 162, 276 S.E.2d 776, 778 (1981)). \r\nIn reviewing whether summary judgment is appropriate regarding a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, the trial court must first determine whether the â€œdefendantâ€™s conduct may be reasonably regarded as so extreme and outrageous as to allow recovery.â€Â  Butts v. AVX Corp., 292 S.C. 256, 262-63, 355 S.E.2d 876, 880 (Ct. App. 1987); Folkens, 290 S.C. at 203, 348 S.E.2d at 844-45.Â  Once the initial showing is made that the conduct could be reasonably considered extreme and outrageous, the matter should be submitted to a jury to determine whether the conduct was â€œsufficiently extreme and outrageous to result in liability.â€Â  Fleming v. Rose, 338 S.C. 524, 537, 526 S.E.2d 732, 739 (Ct. App. 2000), revâ€™d on other grounds, 350 S.C. 488, 567 S.E.2d 857 (2002).Â  â€œ[T]he judge should submit the issue to the jury only where reasonable persons might differ on the issue.â€Â  Gattison v. South Carolina State College, 318 S.C. 148, 151-52, 456 S.E2d 414, 416 (Ct. App. 1995); see Ford, 276 S.C. at 166, 276 S.E.2d at 780 (explaining â€œit is the province of the jury to make a factual determinationâ€).Â  One instance in which the matter should be submitted to the jury is when the business relationship may make the conduct excusable.Â  Ford, 276 S.C. at 166, 276 S.E.2d at 780 (noting â€œa business relationship may sometimes justify oneâ€™s conduct and make that conduct excusable or at least less culpable, but it is at most a factor to be considered and weighed by the juryâ€).\r\nTo be outrageous, the conduct generally must include â€œâ€˜hostile or abusive encountersâ€™ or â€˜coercive or oppressive conduct.â€™â€Â  Fleming, 338 S.C. at 538, 526 S.E.2d at 739 (citations omitted); see Gattison, 318 S.C. at 152, 456 S.E.2d at 416 (noting â€œthat mere retaliatory discharge . . . absent claims of verbal assaults or hostile, abusive encounters, did not rise to the level required for the tort of outrageâ€); Wright v. Sparrow, 298 S.C. 469, 473, 381 S.E.2d 503, 506 (Ct. App. 1989) (finding the conduct was not so extreme and outrageous as to exceed all possible bounds of decency without evidence of â€œhostile or abusive encounters or oppressive abuseâ€).Â  A single encounter of verbal abuse may be insufficient to prevent summary judgment.Â  See Shipman v. Glenn, 314 S.C. 327, 329, 443 S.E.2d 921, 923 (Ct. App. 1994) (affirming the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in a case involving a single incident in which the employer ridiculed an employeeâ€™s speech impediment and threatened to terminate the individualâ€™s employment).Â  However, evidence of repeated verbal abuse may present sufficient evidence of outrageous conduct.Â  See Ford, 276 S.C. at 166, 267 S.E.2d at 780 (holding evidence of repeated incidents of vicious, cruel, profane, oral accosting was susceptible to the inference it was â€œnot a mere complaint . . . but was instead a continuing pattern of highly questionable conduct over a period of almost two years,â€ and thus sufficient to support the jury verdict).\r\nHere, the trial court found Hansson did not experience â€œhostile or abusive encountersâ€ or â€œcoercive or oppressive conduct.â€Â  Relying on Hanssonâ€™s deposition testimony that he was happy at his job because he was left alone 99% of the time, the court determined that the conduct was not so extreme and outrageous as to meet the second element of an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.Â  \r\nViewed in a light most favorable to Hansson, the evidence, at the very least, is conflicting and susceptible to more than one reasonable inference. The conduct of Scalise and Scalise Builders included constant commentary about Hanssonâ€™s sexuality, repeated profanity directed towards Hansson, and even lewd physical contact.Â  These abusive encounters were not limited to a single incident and Hansson indicated he suffered from emotional distress, including sleeplessness and teeth grinding, as a result.Â  Although the evidence conflicts as to the frequency of the harassment, it does suggest repeated occurrences.Â  The evidence also conflicts as to whether the comments were made in a joking manner as opposed to a hostile one.Â  Furthermore, the fact that the behavior of the defendants occurred on construction sites and the fact that Hansson himself used profanity and made off-color jokes may serve to make the conduct excusable.Â  However, such a decision is for a jury to make.Â  Because reasonable minds could differ on whether the conduct of Scalise and Scalise Builders was outrageous, the trial court erred in failing to submit the matter to the jury. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nHansson sufficiently established that reasonable minds could differ as to whether the conduct of Scalise and Scalise Builders was outrageous.Â  Because he demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact regarding outrageousness, summary judgment was not appropriate.Â  Thus, the decision of the trial court is\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n HUFF, JJ., concurs.\r\n KITTREDGE, JJ., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n KITTREDGE, J.: Â I respectfully dissent.\r\nWhile I agree with the majorityâ€™s conclusion that â€œreasonable minds could differ as to whether the conduct of Scalise and Scalise Builders was outrageous,â€ I find Hansson failed to show any facts legally sufficient for a jury to conclude he actually suffered severe emotional distress as a result of the alleged conduct.Â  I would therefore affirm the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of Respondents Sam Scalise and Scalise Builders. \r\nAs set out by the majority, our supreme court has adopted a rule of liability relating to intentional infliction of emotional distress that requires a plaintiff to prove four distinct elements. See Ford v. Hutson, 276 S.C. 157, 162, 276 S.E.2d 776, 778 (1981) (our supreme courtâ€™s first articulation of the four element test for establishing intentional infliction of emotional distress).Â  I would concur in the majorityâ€™s finding that a proper jury question is raised as to the first three of these four elements regarding (1) the intentional or reckless nature of the alleged conduct, (2) the degree to which the alleged conduct is sufficiently â€œextreme and outrageous,â€ and (3) the potential causal connection to the claimed â€œdistress.â€Â  However, I part company with the majority on the question raised by the fourth element: whether â€œthe emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff was â€˜severeâ€™ so that â€˜no reasonable man could be expected to endure it.â€™â€ Id. (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 46 cmt. j (1965)).Â  \r\nIn articulating the fourth element of the tort in this manner, our supreme court has clearly indicated that, to satisfy this element, more must be shown than mere â€œemotional distress.â€Â  Rather, the standard expressed in the rule requires a plaintiff to show he suffered a severely disabling emotional response to the defendantâ€™s conduct.Â  Comment â€œjâ€ of section 46 of the Restatement (Second) of Tortsâ€”upon which our supreme court relied heavily in adopting this rule of liability[2]â€”elaborates on this requirement:\r\nEmotional distress passes under various names, such as mental suffering, mental anguish, mental or nervous shock, or the like. It includes all highly unpleasant mental reactions, such as fright, horror, grief, shame, humiliation, embarrassment, anger, chagrin, disappointment, worry, and nausea.Â  It is only where it is extreme that the liability arises.Â  Complete emotional tranquillity is seldom attainable in this world, and some degree of transient and trivial emotional distress is a part of the price of living among people.Â  The law intervenes only where the distress inflicted is so severe that no reasonable man could be expected to endure it.Â  The intensity and the duration of the distress are factors to be considered in determining its severity.Â  Severe distress must be proved; but in many cases the extreme and outrageous character of the defendantâ€™s conduct is in itself important evidence that the distress has existed. \r\n. . . .\r\nIt is for the court to determine whether on the evidence severe emotional distress can be found; it is for the jury to determine whether, on the evidence, it has in fact existed.\r\nRestatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 46 cmt. j (1965) (emphasis added); see also Rhodes v. Security Fin. Corp. of Landrum, 268 S.C. 300, 233 S.E.2d 105 (1977) (holding that there is no liability for emotional distress without a showing that the distress inflicted was extreme or severe and where there is no showing that plaintiffâ€™s emotional upset was other than transient and trivial).[3]Â  Therefore, the severity of emotional distress not only bears on the amount of recovery, but in the first instance â€œ[i]t is for the court to determine whether on the evidence severe emotional distress can be found.â€ Restatement, supra.\r\nThe burden upon plaintiffs to show more than minorâ€”or even moderateâ€”emotional distress as a prerequisite to any liability is in keeping with the rigorous analysis our courts have applied to claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  Indeed, we have noted that claims arising under this tort should be scrutinized closely by the trial and appellate courts so that this cause of action is not allowed to become a â€œpanacea for wounded feelings rather than reprehensible conduct.â€ Todd v. South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 283 S.C. 155, 171, 321 S.E.2d 602, 611 (Ct. App. 1984), revâ€™d on other grounds, 287 S.C. 190, 336 S.E.2d 472 (1985); see also Gattison v. S.C. State College, 318 S.C. 148, 152, 456 S.E.2d 414, 416 (Ct. App. 1995) (comprehensively surveying the decisional authority in our state addressing claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress and reiterating â€œour reluctance to permit the tort of outrage to become a â€˜panacea for wounded feelings rather than reprehensible conductâ€™â€).Â  The particularized and exacting legal standard that applies to claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress thus imposes upon our trial courts a critical gatekeeping role to ensure this tort does not become a broad â€œcatchallâ€ that is raised when other tort remedies fail.\r\nExamining the claim in the present case, I would hold the circuit court correctly ruled there is no evidence, legally sufficient for submission to the jury, that the distress allegedly suffered by Hansson was â€œsevereâ€ within the contemplation of the rule.Â  Hansson conceded that â€œninety-nine percent (99%) of the time, no one [at the worksite] bothered [him].â€Â Â  Indeed, he admitted he was a willing participant in some of the alleged offensive exchanges.Â  Hansson testified that he, too, â€œjoked aroundâ€ and frequently used profanity at the construction siteâ€”even walking around the worksite with the head of a doll in his hand, holding his hand out to co-workers and asking, â€œdo you want a little head?â€Â  Hansson in fact admitted in his deposition testimony that one of the targets of his â€œdollâ€™s headâ€ joke was Sam Scalise, the very individual Hansson alleges was the source of much of the harassment he claims to have suffered.Â  On the other hand, the â€œmental anguishâ€ Hansson claims to have endured as a result of Respondentsâ€™ conduct was unaccompanied by any evidentiary particulars other than vague assertions that he lost sleep and that his dentist told him he appeared to be grinding his teeth at night.Â  There is no evidence that Hansson ever sought treatment from a physician or any other health care provider or counselor as a result of his emotional distress.Â  There is also no evidence that the alleged conduct impaired Hanssonâ€™s ability to perform his work. To the contrary, Hansson specifically testified the alleged harassment did not affect his ability to do his job. \r\nGranting the vulgar and inappropriate nature of Respondentsâ€™ alleged conduct towards Hansson, I nevertheless would find that, as a matter of law, this record fails to establish the fourth element of the cause of actionâ€”that the emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff was so severe that no reasonable man could be expected to endure it.Â  I would therefore affirm the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment on this issue.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  In addition to his action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, Hanssonâ€™s complaint alleged causes of action for breach of contract, slander, and wrongful retention of wages.Â  Although the trial court granted summary judgment on all the claims, Hanssonâ€™s only issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  \r\n[2] See Ford, 276 S.C. at 162, 276 S.E.2d at 778-79 (quoting extensively from the comments to this Restatement section).\r\n[3] Though Rhodes v. Security Finance Corp. of Landrum was decided before the express recognition of the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress in Ford v. Hutson, it was cited with approval by the supreme court in that case.Â  See Ford, 276 S.C. at 161, 276 S.E.2d at 778.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-341","title":"Fassuliotis v.

Grogan, of Mt. Pleasant, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this domestic relations action, Dennis Fassuliotis (Father) sought modification of his visitation rights.Â  Father appeals from the family courtâ€™s order granting Maureen Fassuliotisâ€™ (Mother) motion to dismiss his complaint.Â  Additionally, Father challenges the award of $2,800.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees to Mother.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. \r\nFACTS\r\nThe parties were divorced in 2001 and have two children, ages eight and nine.Â  During the divorce litigation, the parties executed a detailed â€œStipulation Regarding Custody and Visitation.â€Â  This agreement was incorporated into the final divorce decree.[1]Â  \r\nPursuant to the terms of the custody and visitation agreement, the parties have joint custody of the children, with Mother having primary physical custody.Â  Accordingly, the children reside with Mother, but have visitation with Father every other weekend, every Wednesday afternoon, and Monday afternoons following weekends when they are with Mother.Â  Detailed stipulations control holiday and summer visitations.Â  The parties also agreed that they would be entitled to additional visitation at such other times as they may agree in writing.Â  \r\nThe parties further agreed that Wife must consult with Husband before making changes in the childrenâ€™s schooling and extracurricular activities.Â  Additionally, the children are to be raised in the Greek Orthodox faith, and Father is responsible for their religious training.Â  Father is to consult with Mother regarding any changes in their training.Â  He is entitled to enroll them in Sunday school and summer Bible school for a minimum of one week per summer, provided he pays the cost and it does not conflict with their academic summer school.Â  \r\nIn 2002, Father commenced an action for modification of visitation and at the same time filed a motion for emergency relief requesting the family court to order Mother to trade visitation weekends with him so he could take the children to a family gathering in Connecticut.Â  The family court granted Father the emergency relief requested.Â  \r\nIn his complaint for modification of visitation, Father alleges Mother has engaged in actions that were detrimental to the best interests of the children.Â  Specifically, Father alleges the Mother: (1) keeps the children in daycare even though Father is available to care for them; (2) refuses to allow him to take the children to Greek Orthodox services on Sunday mornings during weekends when the children are with her; (3) refuses to allow him to take the children to Greek school on Monday afternoons when Mother has the children; (4) has refused to allow Father to take the children to family gatherings occurring during her visitation times; and (5) unilaterally removed the children from Montessori school and put them in a public school, which dismisses earlier, but refuses to allow Father to pick them up from school on his visitation days.Â  \r\nFather prayed the family court grant him the right of first refusal to care for the children when Mother is at work rather than putting them in daycare or leaving them with babysitters.Â  Father also requested the court require Mother to give him the option of taking the children to church on Sundays and Monday afternoons when they are with her unless she notifies him within 48 hours of the event that she has alternate plans for them.Â  Additionally, Father asked the court to require Mother to allow him visitation for family gatherings so long as he offers Mother reasonable exchange options.Â  He also demanded that Mother allow him to pick up the children from school when school dismisses before the scheduled 2:30 p.m. transfer time, and that she allow him to keep the children on the day following Monday and Wednesday visitations if public school is not in session unless Mother takes the day off from work and cares for the children herself.Â  Finally, Father sought court-ordered mediation to resolve visitation disputes without going back to court, appointment of a guardian ad litem, and attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  \r\nMother filed a motion to dismiss Fatherâ€™s complaint for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  After a hearing, the family court granted Motherâ€™s motion, finding that Father had failed to allege facts from which the court could find a material and substantial change affecting the welfare of the children.[2]Â  The family court also awarded Mother $2,800.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees for defending the action.Â  \r\nFather, acting pro se, filed a motion to amend the judgment, or alternatively, for a new trial.[3]Â  Fatherâ€™s motion challenged the order of dismissal on several grounds.Â  In relevant part, Father argued that the order violates Rules 20 and 26, SCRFC, in that the award of attorneyâ€™s fees was determined based upon financial declarations from the prior divorce action.Â  Father also contended that the family court failed to consider the factors required by law in determining the amount of the award and that the amount was excessive.Â  The family court denied the motion, but more fully set forth the basis for its award of attorney fees.Â  \r\nThis appeal followed.Â  Father raises two issues on appeal:Â  (1) the family court erred in dismissing his action; and (2) the family court erred in awarding Mother attorneyâ€™s fees and costs. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nRule 2(a), SCRFC, provides that the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure apply when no Family Court Rule applies.Â  Under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, a motion to dismiss may be granted when a defendant demonstrates that the plaintiff has failed to plead facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.Â  Flateau v. Harrelson, 355 S.C. 197, 201, 584 S.E.2d 413, 415 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The family courtâ€™s ruling must be based solely on the allegations on the face of the complaint.Â  Id. at 201-02, 584 S.E.2d at 415.Â  The motion should be denied if facts alleged and inferences therefrom would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory of the case.Â  Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 527, 511 S.E.2d 69, 73 (1999).Â  An appellate court applies the same standard of review as the trial court.Â  Williams v. Condon, 347 S.C. 227, 233, 553 S.E.2d 496, 500 (Ct. App. 2001). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Motion to Dismiss\r\nFather first argues that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to survive Motherâ€™s motion to dismiss.Â  We agree in part.\r\nA judicial order fixing visitation rights is not final, and may be modified based on changed circumstances.Â  McGregor v. McGregor, 255 S.C. 179, 183, 177 S.E.2d 599, 600-01 (1970).Â  When a court has previously established visitation, the moving party has the burden of showing a change of circumstances sufficient to warrant a change in visitation rights.Â  Ingold v. Ingold, 304 S.C. 316, 320, 404 S.E.2d 35, 37 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  \r\nIn the case sub judice, the parties agreed to detailed visitation.Â  While Father argues in his brief that the standard for modification of visitation should be lower than the standard for a change in custody, we can find no such distinction in the law.Â  The guiding standard for both situations is a change in circumstances.Â  See Ingold, 304 S.C. at 320, 404 S.E.2d at 37 (applying the standard to visitation); Kisling v. Allison, 343 S.C. 674, 678-79, 541 S.E.2d 273, 275-76 (Ct. App. 2001) (applying the standard to custody); see also 24A Am. Jur. 2d Divorce and Separation Â§ 991 (2004) (providing the same standard for modification of both custody and visitation without comment).Â  \r\nThere are no hard and fast rules for determining when a sufficient change in circumstances has occurred to warrant modification of visitation.Â  Kisling, 343 S.C. at 679, 541 S.E.2d at 275.Â  When the non-custodial parent seeks modification in custody, two criteria must be established:Â  (1) there must have been a substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the children; and (2) the proposed modification is in the overall best interests of the children.Â  Latimer v. Farmer, 360 S.C. 375, 381, 602 S.E.2d 32, 35 (2004).Â  The change in circumstances must occur after the date of the original order setting custody and visitation.Â  Kisling, 343 S.C. at 679, 541 S.E.2d at 276.Â  \r\nOn a motion to dismiss, we must ordinarily consider only the allegations on the face of the complaint.Â  Flateau v. Harrelson, 355 S.C. 197, 201-02, 584 S.E.2d 413, 415 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œThe question to be considered is whether, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the pleadings articulate any valid claim for relief.â€Â  Williams v. Condon, 347 S.C. 227, 233, 553 S.E.2d 496, 499 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  However, as noted above, the parties have, in effect, made the divorce decree and custody and visitation agreement a part of the pleadings.\r\nFather asserts in his brief that at the time of the divorce he could not have foreseen that Mother would place the children in daycare or with a babysitter when they were with her.Â  He therefore requests the â€œright of first refusalâ€ to care for the children when they would otherwise be with a babysitter or in daycare. Â These allegations do not assert a change of conditions.Â  The pleadings reflect that Father knew Mother worked at the time of the divorce and would likely be required to work after the divorce to provide for herself and the children.Â  If he wanted to ensure that the children were not placed in daycare, he could have negotiated that in the settlement.Â  Furthermore, Father cites no law in support of his demand for a court-ordered right of first refusal.\r\nThe complaint seeks â€œat least two hours of mediationâ€ to resolve minor visitation issues generally.Â  Father alleges that Mother â€œunilaterally changed the childrenâ€™s school,â€ and that, unlike private school, the public school sometimes dismisses before 2:30 p.m., but Mother refuses to allow him to pick the children up from school when it dismisses.Â  The agreement specifically provides that Mother was not required to keep the children in private school, but she was to consult with Father on any changes in schooling or extracurricular activities. The agreement also provides that her failure to do so gave Father the right to require â€œone mediation session on the issue.â€Â  The Fatherâ€™s complaint claims the Mother â€œunilaterallyâ€ changed the childrenâ€™s school, thus, inferentially creating the circumstance requiring the children to go to daycare after school.Â  We hold that these allegations are sufficient to permit the family court to find husband entitled to mediation on this issue.Â  We remand this issue to the family court.Â  Further, we caution the parties that parents awarded joint custody have a duty to act in the childrenâ€™s best interests, and may not use them as pawns or clubs in their battles with each other.Â  Nash v. Byrd, 298 S.C. 530, 536, 381 S.E.2d 913, 916 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  \r\nFather also asserts that because the decree makes him primarily responsible for the childrenâ€™s religious upbringing, he should be allowed to take the children to church during Motherâ€™s visitation periods.Â  The agreement also states that Father is to consult with Mother on changes in religious training, and that he is entitled to enroll them in Sunday School.Â  While this language does not require the Mother to take them to church or Sunday school, it certainly infers that the Mother will cooperate with the Father in their religious training.Â  Moreover, it can be inferred from such language that the parties thought regular attendance at Sunday school and church was essential to the childrenâ€™s religious training.Â  Construing the pleadings in the light most favorable to the Father, and giving him the benefit of reasonable inferences, we hold they set forth facts upon which a court could grant relief to the Father. \r\nFinally, Father seeks a modification of the agreement that would require Mother to allow him to have the children for visiting relatives and family gatherings.Â  The parties have already agreed to a detailed visitation schedule.Â  When Father sought emergency relief to take the children to an important family gathering on one of Motherâ€™s weekends, the relief was granted.Â  Therefore, Father alleges no circumstance now existing to warrant such a modification.Â  Thus, there was no error in the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of this claim. \r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nFather also challenges the award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  He argues the following on appeal: (1) the family court failed to make adequate findings of fact pursuant to Rule 26 and, more specifically, failed to require financial declarations pursuant to Rule 20 before making the award; (2) the family court failed to consider the factors required by law; and (3) Father was improperly denied his request to question Motherâ€™s counsel regarding hours spent in preparation.Â  An attorney fee award must be based on adequate findings of fact.Â  Clearly, the order of dismissal that awarded the Mother attorney fees included no findings of fact.Â  Nevertheless, the court made findings in its order on reconsideration.Â  However, in view of our decision to reverse and remand certain issues, we also reverse and remand the matter of attorney fees.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that the family court improperly dismissed Fatherâ€™s complaint for failure to state a cause of action as to his claims regarding the religious training of the children and the mediation of visitation issues regarding picking the children up from school prior to 2:30 p.m. on Fatherâ€™s visitation days.Â  We further hold that in light of this decision, the award of attorneyâ€™s fees should be reversed and remanded to the family court.Â  Based on the foregoing, the order of the family court is hereby \r\n AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nBEATTY, SHORT, JJ., and CURETON, AJ., concur\r\n\r\n[1] At the hearing on the motion to dismiss, Motherâ€™s attorney handed up to the court a copy of the divorce decree and the agreement regarding custody and visitation.Â  Fatherâ€™s attorney did not object.Â  Moreover, the trial judge indicated he would read the documents and consider them in his decision.Â  The effect of this is to incorporate these documents into the pleadings for Rule 12(b)(6) purposes. \r\n[2] We note that the order of dismissal grants the Father â€œleave to file another complaint with this court if he believes in good faith that he can state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.â€ \r\n[3] The order notes that Father alleged no procedural basis for his motion.Â  However, the motion clearly states it is based on Rules 59 and 60, SCRCP.Â  See Richland County v. Kaiser, 351 S.C. 89, 94, 567 S.E.2d 260, 262 (Ct. App. 2002) (holding that it is the substance of the relief sought that matters regardless of its form).Â  Moreover, at the motion hearing, both parties referred to Fatherâ€™s motion as one for â€œreconsideration.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-342","title":"Akbar v.

Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  After Benjamin K. Cantrell was convicted and sentenced for driving under the influence in magistrateâ€™s court, he appealed to the circuit court.Â  The circuit court dismissed the appeal as untimely.Â  Cantrell now appeals the order of the circuit court.Â  We affirm.1\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn June 10, 2002, a jury found Cantrell guilty of driving under the influence, and Judge Harold Grimsley sentenced Cantrell to a fine of $737.00.Â  On June 24, 2002, Cantrell sent his notice of appeal via facsimile to Magistrate Cagleâ€™s office.Â  The July 30, 2002 return of the magistrate noted the appeal was not filed in a timely manner, and summarily addressed Cantrellâ€™s reasons for appeal. Â Following a hearing on April 14, 2003, the circuit court found the appeal was not filed within ten days after sentence pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-3-30 and, thus, the appeal was untimely.Â  The circuit court therefore dismissed the appeal.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nCantrell argues the circuit court improperly dismissed his appeal as untimely.Â  He asserts his notice of appeal was delayed because he thought he had thirty days to appeal based on the rule for civil appeals and the fact his case was assigned a civil case number.Â  \r\nInitially, we question whether this issue is preserved for our review as this argument appears to be raised for the first time before this court.2Â  In the hearing before the circuit court, the solicitor argued the appeal was not filed within ten days as required by statute.Â  When the court asked Cantrell what he had to say in that regard, Cantrell stated, â€œNot a whole lot, Your Honor.â€Â  The court then asked Cantrell if he agreed that he filed the appeal after ten days and Cantrell replied, â€œProbably so.â€Â  The court concluded it was a jurisdictional issue and dismissed the appeal.Â  Cantrell never argued to the circuit court that he was misled into believing he had thirty days to file the appeal based on the case number assigned to the matter.3Â  See South Carolina Wildlife &amp; Marine Res. Depâ€™t v. Kunkle, 287 S.C. 177, 179 n.2, 336 S.E.2d 468, 469 n.2 (1985) (noting a reviewing court may not rule on issues not raised in the lower court).Â Â  \r\nAt any rate, we find Cantrellâ€™s argument has no merit.Â  â€œEvery person convicted before a magistrate of any offense whatever and sentenced may appeal from the sentence to the Court of Common Pleas for the county.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-3-10 (Supp. 2004).Â  â€œThe appellant shall, within ten days after sentence, serve notice of appeal upon the magistrate who tried the case, stating the grounds upon which the appeal is founded.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-3-30 (1985).Â  Failure to comply with the procedural requirements for an appeal divests the court of appellate jurisdiction.Â  State v. Brown, 358 S.C. 382, 387, 596 S.E.2d 39, 41 (2004). \r\nIrrespective of Cantrellâ€™s belief that he had thirty days to appeal based on the number assigned to his case, Cantrellâ€™s case was clearly an appeal from a criminal conviction and sentence in magistrateâ€™s court.Â  Cantrellâ€™s notice of appeal was not served within ten days of his sentence as required by statute.4Â  Because the appeal was untimely, the circuit court did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal and properly dismissed it.5Â  Accordingly, the order of the circuit court is\r\n AFFIRMED.  \r\n GOOLSBY, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n2 At trial, Cantrellâ€™s father attempted to represent him, but the magistrate did not allow the non-attorney father to act as Cantrellâ€™s legal representative.Â  Instead, Cantrell was represented by an attorney.Â  On appeal to the circuit court, Cantrellâ€™s father again attempted to represent him, but when the circuit court refused to allow it, Cantrell proceeded pro se.Â  Cantrellâ€™s proceeding pro se does not excuse him from complying with the substantive and procedural requirements of the law.Â  State v. Burton, 356 S.C. 259, 265 n.5, 589 S.E.2d 6, 9 n.5 (2003).\r\n3 Although issues relating to subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at anytime, this issue does not involve subject matter jurisdiction as our courts have held that a partyâ€™s failure to comply with procedural requirements of an appeal from magistrateâ€™s court to the circuit court divests the court of appellate jurisdiction, but does not affect the circuit courtâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction.Â  State v. Brown, 358 S.C. 382, 387, 596 S.E.2d 39, 41 (2004).Â Â  \r\n4 We further note the notice of appeal was apparently not served on the magistrate who tried the case, but was faxed to the chief magistrate fourteen days after his sentence.Â  Â \r\n5 Based on our determination the circuit court properly dismissed the appeal, we need not address the other arguments raised by Cantrell to this court that his conviction should be reversed based on several other issues regarding his arrest, legal representation, and alleged errors of the court. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-346","title":"State v.

Â Three of the seven children were subsequently placed in the custody of their grandmother, and the remaining four remained in DSS custody.Â  Crosby failed to remedy the conditions that required removal and a court terminated her parental rights as to the four children in DSS custody.\r\nThis child was born July 16, 2002, and lived with \r\nCrosby until her incarceration in December 2003.Â  Crosby left the child in the custody of two of her grown children, Charles and Takita.Â  On January 9, 2004, Takita brought the child to the hospital because the child suffered a severe respiratory infection.Â  Takita was arrested on the same day.Â  At the hospital, DSS learned of Crosbyâ€™s incarceration.Â  Because no family members were located to take custody of the child, DSS placed him into protective custody.\r\nDSS brought a removal action and sought to terminate Crosbyâ€™s parental rights.Â  The complaint alleged a pattern of neglect on the part of Crosby and asserted the situation requiring removal was not reasonably likely to be remedied within twelve months.Â  \r\nAt trial, the foster mother testified that the child was underweight when DSS placed him in her custody.Â  In addition, he could not chew or swallow solid foods, despite having a full set of teeth. Â Also, the childâ€™s immunizations were not up to date.Â  Finally, she testified: â€œHe did not make any motions, no talking, no babbling . . . he was basically a shell of a child when we received him which caused us great concern.â€Â  \r\nA DSS caseworker recounted the history of Crosbyâ€™s involvement with DSS.Â  She stated Crosby never successfully completed a treatment plan.Â  The caseworker testified:Â  â€œThis child has a great many medical problems and heâ€™s in the best care where he needs to be at this point in time.â€Â  Ultimately, she testified that given the condition of the child when he entered the custody of DSS, it was neglect for Crosby to leave the child with her other children.Â \r\nCrosby testified her children were willing to and capable of taking care of the child.Â  Crosbyâ€™s children, however, were not present at the trial to demonstrate their willingness to accept custody.\r\nThe trial court found â€œ[t]he medical condition of the minor child when he entered foster care, coupled with the fact that the minor child had no one to take care of him or ensure his needs were being met at the time he was taken into emergency protective custody, constitutes neglect by Teresa Crosby.â€Â  The court further found that Crosbyâ€™s history with DSS, along with the findings of physical neglect of the child, constituted a repetition of neglect that made it unlikely the home could be made safe within twelve months.Â  The court terminated her parental rights pursuant to section 20-7-1572(1) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nCrosby contends the trial court erred in terminating her parental rights under section 20-7-1572(1) because there was no evidence she neglected the child by leaving him in the custody of her grown children.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 20-7-1572 states:\r\n\r\n  The family court may order the termination of parental rights upon a finding of one or more of the following grounds and a finding that termination is in the best interest of the child: \r\n  1) The child or another child in the home has been harmed as defined in Section 20-7-490, and because of the severity or repetition of the abuse or neglect, it is not reasonably likely that the home can be made safe within twelve months.Â  In determining the likelihood that the home can be made safe, the parentâ€™s previous abuse or neglect of the child or another child in the home may be considered. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(1) (Supp. 2004).Â  Section 20-7-490 states in pertinent part as follows:Â \r\n\r\n  (2) â€œChild abuse or neglectâ€, or â€œharmâ€ occurs when the parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the childâ€™s welfare:\r\n  (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inflicts or allows to be inflicted upon the child physical or mental injury or engages in acts or omissions which present a substantial risk of physical or mental injury to the child . . .; \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . . \r\n  (c) fails to supply the child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, or education as required under Article 1 of Chapter 65 of Title 59, supervision appropriate to the childâ€™s age and development, or health care though financially able to do so or offered financial or other reasonable means to do so and the failure to do so has caused or presents a substantial risk of causing physical or mental injury. . . ;\r\n  (d) abandons the child;\r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â . . . .\r\n  (f) has committed abuse or neglect as described in subsections (a) through (e) such that a child who subsequently becomes part of the personâ€™s household is at substantial risk of one of those forms of abuse or neglect.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nAs found by the trial court, Crosby has a â€œlong history of neglect.â€Â  The prior action, coupled with the poor medical and developmental condition of the child in this action, support the courtâ€™s finding that Crosby neglected the child.Â  The repetition of neglect likely would not be remedied within twelve months, as Crosby remains incarcerated and no person has indicated a willingness to accept custody of the child.Â  Accordingly, there is ample evidence in the record to support the trial courtâ€™s finding that Crosbyâ€™s parental rights should be terminated under section 20-7-1572(1).\r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-350","title":"State v.

Ralph Garris, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Gregory Jacobs English, of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this landlord/tenant action, Helen L. Fleshman, in her capacity as personal representative to the estate of her late husband, James G. Fleshman, appeals a circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of Trilogy and CarOrder.com (collectively Respondents).Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nJames G. Fleshman owned commercial property in Richland County. Â On August 15, 1999, he entered into a three-year lease with CarOrder.com, which was scheduled to end on August 14, 2002.Â  Respondent Trilogy guaranteed CarOrder.comâ€™s performance.Â  The lease provided a renewal option for three successive two-year periods.Â  The lease also provided that CarOrder.com could sublease the premises with Fleshmanâ€™s written approval.Â  \r\nWith Fleshmanâ€™s consent, CarOrder.com entered into a sublease with a company known as Bentleyâ€™s for a term beginning on September 1, 2000 and ending on August 14, 2002.Â  Bentleyâ€™s agreed to pay rent and to maintain the premises as required under the master lease between Fleshman and CarOrder.com.Â  Fleshman approved the agreement in writing by signing the sublease.Â  In May 2001, Dance America, LLC (Dance America) purchased Bentleyâ€™s assets and was assigned the sublease.Â  \r\nOn June 6, 2002, CarOrder.com provided written notice to Fleshman that it would not exercise its option to renew the master lease and that both leases would terminate on August 14, 2002.Â  On August 8, 2002, Dance America wrote a letter to Fleshman, seeking to exercise the renewal option.Â  Fleshman then wrote a letter to Trilogy dated August 14, 2002, in which he expressed his lack of interest in extending the lease and requested that Trilogy remove Dance America from the premises.Â  Respondents replied on August 28, 2002, explaining that because they no longer had a legal interest in the property, they had no right or duty to remove Dance America from the premises.Â  \r\nUltimately, Fleshman successfully brought an ejectment proceeding against Dance America.Â  Fleshman also brought an action against Respondents, arguing they had an obligation to remove Dance America.[1]Â  Fleshman asserted he was entitled to collect, inter alia, costs for the ejectment action, compensation for loss of economic advantage, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nRespondents filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  Fleshman amended the complaint twice, and the parties agreed the motion to dismiss would apply to both amended complaints.Â  The trial court granted the motion and denied Fleshmanâ€™s subsequent motion to reconsider.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nâ€œIn deciding whether the trial court properly granted the motion to dismiss, this Court must consider whether the complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, states any valid claim for relief.â€Â  Flateau v. Harrelson, 355 S.C. 197, 202, 584 S.E.2d 413, 415 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing Gentry v. Yonce, 337 S.C. 1, 5, 522 S.E.2d 137, 139 (1999) and Cowart v. Poore, 337 S.C. 359, 523 S.E.2d 182 (Ct. App. 1999)).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n\r\nI.Â  Motion to Dismiss\r\nFleshman argues the trial court erred in granting the motion to dismiss because Respondents assumed the role of landlord when they sublet the property.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen a defendant demonstrates that a plaintiff has failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, the trial court may dismiss the claim.Â  The Hous. Auth. of City of Columbia v. Cornerstone Hous., LLC, 356 S.C. 328, 333-34, 588 S.E.2d 617, 620 (Ct. App. 2003) (citations omitted).Â  A dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, is appropriate when the factual allegations in the complaint, even if assumed to be true, fail to state a cause of action.Â  Chewning v. Ford Motor Co., 346 S.C. 28, 32-33, 550 S.E.2d 584, 586 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nSection 27-35-60 of the South Carolina Code (1991), defines the relationship and correspondent duties between a landlord, tenant, and sublessee as follows:\r\n\r\n  A sublease by a tenant without written consent of the landlord is a nullity insofar as the rights of the landlord are concerned, except that rent collected by a tenant from a subtenant shall be deemed to be held in trust by the tenant for the benefit of the landlord until the payment of the landlordâ€™s claim for rent. But when the premises have been sublet the sublessor, as between himself and the subtenant or sublessee, shall be deemed the landlord and the sublessee the tenant under him and the provisions of Chapters 33 through 37, Â§ 27-39-10 and Article 3 of Chapter 39 of this Title, other than Â§Â§ 27-35-80, 27-35-170 and 27-35-180, 27-39-280 and 27-39-300 shall apply to sublessors and sublessees, as between themselves, as in other cases of landlord and tenant.\r\n\r\nSignificantly, statutes governing ejectment proceedings apply only when a landlord and tenant relationship actually exists.Â  See, e.g., Stewart-Jones Co. v. Shehan, 127 S.C. 451, 456, 121 S.E. 374, 376 (1924); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-37-20 (1991) (providing an ejectment action is instituted by a magistrate-issued rule upon application of the landlord).Â  The term â€œlandlordâ€ includes â€œthe owner or person in possession or entitled to possession of the real estate used or occupied by the tenant.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-33-10(7) (1991).\r\nWhen interpreting a contract that is clear and unambiguous, the court must construe its provisions according to the terms used by the parties, understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense.Â  Schulmeyer v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., 353 S.C. 491, 495, 579 S.E.2d 132, 134 (2003)Â  (citations omitted).Â  â€œThe Court cannot write a contract for the parties. When the parties have not, expressly or by implication, agreed upon essential terms of a contract, the Court cannot supply them.â€Â  Laseter v. Pet Dairy Prods. Co., 246 F.2d 747, 750 (4th Cir. 1957).\r\nSection 27-35-60 provides for situations in which the sublease was obtained without the consent of the landlord.Â  In the instant case, Fleshman provided written consent by signing the sublease.Â  Thus, the statute did not create a duty by which Respondents became landlords and were under an obligation to eject Dance America from the premises.Â  In addition to not having a duty to eject, Respondents did not have a statutory right to do so because the applicable statute does not consider them landlords.Â  Fleshman was the landlord and, therefore, the only party with the right to eject Dance America.\r\nSimilarly, no contractual responsibility in this regard was created in the sublease.Â  Certainly, Fleshmanâ€™s letter to Trilogy declining to exercise the renewal option did not create a duty to eject.Â  Even assuming for the sake of argument that a contractual responsibility was created in the lease or sublease, Fleshman did not raise this argument at trial, and he cannot raise this issue for the first time on appeal.Â  See, e.g., Brown v. Theos, 338 S.C. 305, 312-13, 526 S.E.2d 232, 237 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nAny duties Respondents owed to Fleshman ceased upon termination of the lease on August 14, 2002.Â  Thereafter, Dance America would have been either a tenant at will or a trespasser because it was not in possession pursuant to any contract with Respondents or Fleshman.Â  See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 27-33-10(3) (1991) &amp; 27-35-40 (1991) (defining and explaining tenancy at will when a person uses or occupies real estate without an agreement); see also Carson v. Living Word Outreach Ministries, Inc., 315 S.C. 64, 69, 431 S.E.2d 615, 617-18 (Ct. App. 1993) (describing the creation of a tenancy at will after lease termination).Â  Irrespective of Dance Americaâ€™s status, Respondents were not in possession of the premises nor bound by any statutory or contractual relationship with Fleshman or Dance America.Â  Thus, the removal of Dance America was entirely up to Fleshman as owner of the property.Â  \r\nBecause Fleshman has not demonstrated that Respondents owed a duty to eject Dance America, he has failed to state a cause of action.Â  Therefore, the trial court did not err in granting Respondentsâ€™ motion to dismiss.\r\nII.Â  Motion to Reconsider, Alter, or Amend the Judgment\r\nFleshman contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to reconsider because the trial court failed to make findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Rules 41 and 52, SCRCP.Â  We disagree.\r\nAccording to Rule 41(b), â€œ[i]f the court renders judgment on the merits against the plaintiff, the court shall make findings as provided in Rule 52(a).â€Â  However, Rule 52(a) provides that findings of fact and conclusions of law are unnecessary when a court decides motions under Rule 12.\r\nRule 41, is not applicable to this case.Â  It applies in situations where the plaintiff has presented all of its evidence.Â  In this case, Respondents moved to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).Â  Because Rule 52, SCRCP does not require the trial court to make findings of fact or conclusions of law in Rule 12 rulings, the trial court did not err in issuing a form order.\r\nAFFIRMED.

Wade Cleveland, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nStephen John Henry, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The School District of Greenville (the District) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order reversing the expulsion of A.S., a student at Eastside High School, for bringing a knife onto campus.Â  Using the scope of review pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act, the circuit court found substantial evidence did not support the decision to expel A.S.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nAfter school on November 13, 2002, sixteen-year-old A.S. brought a knife, along with other construction materials, into the school library to cut foam board for nametags for an extracurricular activity called Youth in Government.Â  The schoolâ€™s media specialist working in the library at the time confiscated the knife and took it to Stan Hopkins, a school administrator.Â  Hopkins brought the knife to principal Sheryl Taylor who reported the incident to the District.Â  \r\nBy letter dated November 13, 2002, Taylor informed A.S.â€™s parents she was suspended â€œpending a recommendation for expulsionâ€ for â€œpossession of a knife on campus.â€Â  On November 14, 2002, Taylor sent A.S.â€™s parents a letter indicating that because A.S. brought a knife with a four-inch blade onto the schoolâ€™s campus, Taylor recommended A.S. for expulsion in accordance with the Districtâ€™s zero tolerance policy.Â  A.S.â€™s parents wrote a letter to the Districtâ€™s Board of Trustees (the â€œBoardâ€) requesting A.S. be readmitted to school because A.S. only brought a â€œserrated kitchen knifeâ€ to school to use as a tool.Â  \r\nTaylorâ€™s recommendation resulted in a hearing before Dr. Don Dempsey, the District Hearing Officer, on November 21, 2002.Â  Dempsey had before him a file and submissions from A.S.â€™s attorney.Â  This included an affidavit from A.S.â€™s physician that explained how A.S.â€™s attention deficit hyperactivity disorder affected her ability to control her impulses.Â  Additionally, Dempsey heard testimony from A.S. and her mother as well as from Taylor.Â  A.S. admitted bringing a â€œkitchen knifeâ€ to school, and her mother described the knife as having a â€œlong blade.â€Â  In closing arguments, A.S.â€™s attorney argued that although his client brought a knife to school with a â€œblade longer than two inches,â€ A.S. had no intent to use the knife as a weapon.Â  \r\nBased upon this evidence, Dempsey found A.S. violated the Districtâ€™s rules by bringing a knife onto campus and ordered her expelled for the remainder of the 2002-2003 school year.Â  The District confirmed the decision by letter stating A.S. could apply for readmission to Eastside for the 2003-2004 school year and outlined the procedure for appealing Dempseyâ€™s decision to the Board.Â  On appeal, the Board upheld the expulsion, but it shortened the expulsion period from the remainder of the year to the remainder of the semester.Â  As a result, A.S. would miss only three weeks of school and could reapply for admission for the second semester of the 2002-2003 school year in January 2003.Â  \r\nA.S. appealed to the circuit court, and the court reversed.Â  The court found the Districtâ€™s expulsion policy required it to establish A.S. brought a knife over two inches long to school, or alternatively, to establish A.S. brought a knife with a blade less than two inches long to school with the intention of inflicting bodily injury or death.Â  The court found there was no evidence in the record of the knife bladeâ€™s length and that A.S. had no intent to inflict bodily injury or death.Â  Applying the substantial evidence standard of review pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), the circuit court reversed the Boardâ€™s decision.Â  The District appealed.Â  Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Mootness\r\nAs an initial matter, we address whether the issue before us is moot.Â  Generally, an appellate court will not address a moot question or make an adjudication when no actual controversy remains.Â  Byrd v. Irmo High School, 321 S.C. 426, 431-32, 468 S.E.2d 861, 864 (1996) (addressing mootness with regard to a studentâ€™s ten-day suspension).Â  A case becomes moot when judgment, if rendered, will have no practical legal effect upon an existing controversy.Â  This is true when some event occurs making it impossible for the reviewing court to grant effectual relief.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn Byrd, our supreme court was asked to decide whether review of a studentâ€™s ten-day suspension was warranted because the student had served the suspension by the time the matter reached the appellate court.Â  The court noted an exception to the mootness doctrine allows a court to take jurisdiction if the issued raised was capable of repetition but evading review.Â  Byrd, 321 S.C. at 431, 468 S.E.2d at 864.Â  The exception does not require that the same complaining party be subject to the action again, but that the controversy presents a recurring dilemma that the court will address to clarify the law.Â  Id.; Evans v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 303 S.C. 108, 110 n.1, 399 S.E.2d 156, 157 n.1 (1990).\r\nEven assuming the issue in the present case is moot because A.S.â€™s expulsion ended as of January 2003 and we can grant no effectual relief, we find the issue is capable of repetition but evading review.Â  As in Byrd, short-term student expulsions, like short-term student suspensions, are â€œcompleted long before an appellate court can review the issues they implicate.â€Â  Byrd, 321 S.C. at 432, 468 S.E.2d at 864.Â  Therefore, the instant case fits within the exception to the mootness doctrine.Â Â  \r\nII. Application of the APA\r\nThe District argues the circuit court erred in finding the APA applies to judicial review of decisions by a school board.Â  Under the APA, a reviewing court may reverse or modify the decision, in part, if it is â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(e) (2005); Laws v. Richland County Sch. Dist. No. 1, 270 S.C. 492, 495-96, 243 S.E.2d 192, 193 (1978) (holding the substantial evidence standard of review applies to judicial review of a school boardâ€™s decision regarding whether to renew a teacherâ€™s contract).Â  However, the District concedes in its brief that the â€œsubstantial evidenceâ€ standard of review is the appropriate one.Â  Therefore, any potential error in applying the â€œsubstantial evidenceâ€ standard pursuant to the APA is harmless and the question is moot.Â  See Brown v. Allstate Ins. Co., 344 S.C. 21, 25, 542 S.E.2d 723, 725 (2001) (finding the erroneous admission of certain evidence was harmless where it would not affect the outcome).Â  Accordingly, we decline to address this issue.Â  See Gainey v. Gainey, 279 S.C. 68, 69, 301 S.E.2d 763, 764 (1983) (â€œThis Court will not issue advisory opinions on questions for which no meaningful relief can be granted.â€).Â  \r\nIII. Substantial Evidence\r\nThe District argues the circuit court erred in determining that substantial evidence did not support the Boardâ€™s decision to expel A.S.Â  Even though the parties agree that the circuit court appropriately examined the expulsion decision under the substantial evidence standard, we find the circuit court erred in reversing the Boardâ€™s decision to expel A.S. for possession of a knife on school property.Â  \r\nThe Districtâ€™s disciplinary code defines what is considered misconduct for which disciplinary action is appropriate.Â  Bringing a weapon to school, including a knife with a blade less than two inches long, is defined as misconduct warranting disciplinary action, including suspension or expulsion as a last resort.Â  Policy JD(P) Â§Â§ I.A &amp; I.B.1 (emphasis added). However, the Districtâ€™s policy requires that certain serious misconduct, including possession of any kind of weapon, â€œwill result in the principalâ€™s recommendation for expulsion.â€Â  Policy JD(P) Â§ I.C.1.A.Â  In defining â€œweapon,â€ the Districtâ€™s policy states that it â€œincludes, but is not limited to, guns, blackjacks, brass knuckles, razors, box openers, knives, with a blade over two inches long, or any other device or object that is possessed or used with the intention of inflicting bodily injury or death.â€Â  Id.Â  (emphasis added).Â  \r\nThe circuit court reviewed the Districtâ€™s policy and the evidence presented at the hearing before Dr. Dempsey.Â  The circuit court determined that in order to recommend expulsion, the District necessarily had to prove that the knife blade exceeded two inches long or that A.S. possessed something with the intent to inflict bodily injury or death.Â  The court determined that there was no evidence on the record regarding the length of the knife blade in question and that there was no evidence that A.S. intended to harm anyone.Â  Based on what it perceived to be a lack of evidence, the court reversed the Districtâ€™s decision to expel A.S.Â  \r\nOur review of the record indicates substantial evidence existed to support the Districtâ€™s decision.Â  Although the District did not introduce the knife at the hearing, no one disputed the contention that the knife A.S. brought to school had a blade longer than two inches.Â  Additionally, the testimony and letters presented at the hearing show the knife blade was longer than two inches.Â  In her letter to A.S.â€™s parents the day following the incident, Taylor stated that A.S. brought a â€œknife with a four-inch blade onto the campus of Eastside High School.â€Â  A.S.â€™s parents did not dispute Taylorâ€™s contention and admitted in a letter to the School Board that A.S. brought a â€œserrated kitchen knifeâ€ to school.Â  At the hearing, A.S. described the knife as a â€œkitchen knife,â€ and her mother stated that the knife had a â€œlong blade.â€Â  Further, A.S.â€™s counsel admitted in closing arguments that the blade was â€œlonger than two inches.â€Â  \r\nNo one disputes that A.S. was a fine student and that she had innocent motives in bringing the kitchen knife to school.Â  Nevertheless, we find there was substantial evidence to support the Boardâ€™s decision to expel A.S., pursuant to the Districtâ€™s mandatory policy, for bringing a knife with a blade longer than two inches to school.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court erred in reversing the Boardâ€™s decision to expel A.S.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAlthough our decision will have no practical legal effect on the controversy at issue, we address this appeal because the situation is capable of repetition yet evading review.Â  As the District concedes, the circuit court appropriately used the substantial evidence standard of review.Â  Based upon the substantial evidence standard of review and our review of the record, we find the circuit court erred in overturning A.S.â€™s expulsion.Â  Therefore, the order of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.\r\nANDERSON, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-361","title":"State v.

Zelenka, Senior Asst. Attorney General William Edgar Salter, III, Office of the Attorney General, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Druanne Dykes White, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Jerry Marvin Galbreath appeals his convictions for murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.Â  He argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict and in allowing rebuttal testimony of an investigating officer. Â We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn the evening of December 27, 2002, Galbreath and his roommate, Johnny Dillard, partied with the victim, Shawn Bates, and the victimâ€™s girlfriend, Pamela Ayers.Â  Both Ayers and Dillard testified that Galbreath and Bates huffed paint, smoked marijuana, and drank alcohol while the four of them drove to a bar.Â  While Bates was in the bar, Galbreath repeatedly told Ayers that he was going to â€œrape herâ€ and kill Bates.Â Â  \r\nAyers told Bates that Galbreath was harassing her.Â  When the four returned to the car, Bates and Galbreath began fighting, and Galbreath sustained minor cuts and bruises.Â  Ayers testified the fight began because Bates threatened to take Galbreathâ€™s car, to which Galbreath replied Bates would be a â€œdead manâ€ and â€œdie that nightâ€ if he tried.Â  Dillard, who was driving the vehicle, pulled over and ordered Bates and Ayers out of the vehicle.Â  Once Dillard and Galbreath arrived back at Galbreathâ€™s home, Dillard parked the car in the garage, and the men went inside.Â  Dillard testified that they continued drinking.Â  At one point Galbreath told Dillard, â€œI will get the little fucker for busting my eyes.Â  I will get even with the bastard.â€Â Â  \r\nAfter being dropped off, Bates and Ayers went to the home of Lynn Davis, who lived near the location where Dillard had left the couple.Â  Bates requested Lynn Davis take him to Galbreathâ€™s home so he could retrieve a baseball cap that he had left in the car.Â  Davis, accompanied by her friend, Kimberly Skinner, and Ayers, drove Bates to Galbreathâ€™s home.Â  Although Ayers, Davis, and Skinner testified that Bates seemed calm on the way to Galbreathâ€™s house, Ayers admitted that he was angry because he did not have his hat.Â Â Â  \r\nAfter arriving at Galbreathâ€™s residence, Bates tried to open the garage door but could not.Â  He hit the garage door with a brick and smeared leaves onto the door.Â  He also leaned a ladder against the house, but he did not attempt to use the ladder for any purpose.Â  Frustrated, Bates returned to Davisâ€™s vehicle, and Davis backed out of the driveway.Â  As the vehicle was leaving the driveway, Galbreathâ€™s porch light came on, and Bates told Davis to stop the car.Â  Bates exited the vehicle and walked toward the house with â€œhis arms out with his hands spread.â€Â  Ayers, Davis, and Skinner heard a gun shot.Â  Bates then returned to the vehicle where he stated Galbreath had shot him.Â  Ayers saw Galbreath close the glass door.Â  Davis drove away from Galbreathâ€™s residence, and an ambulance was called, but Bates did not survive.\r\nDillard testified that he awoke around midnight because he heard knocking or banging on the house.Â  He could also hear Bates outside yelling about wanting his belongings from the car.Â  Dillard returned to bed once the knocking stopped, but woke again moments later when he heard Galbreath and Bates cursing at each other.Â  Dillard then heard a gun shot, whereupon he arose from bed and found Galbreath holding a .22 rifle out the open doorway.Â  Dillard claimed Galbreath told him that he shot Bates, but â€œwished [Bates] would have tried to break in.â€ Â Â Â Â \r\nNeither Galbreath nor Dillard called 911.Â  According to Dillard, Galbreath listened to his police scanner before going to bed.Â Â  \r\nThe police arrested Galbreath the following morning, on December 28, 2002.Â  In May of 2003, a jury found Galbreath guilty of murder and possession of a firearm during a violent crime.Â  The trial court sentenced him to thirty years imprisonment for murder and five years imprisonment for possession of a firearm during a violent crime.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ ANALYSIS\r\nGalbreath claims the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict because he was acting in self-defense and in defense of habitation.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen ruling on a motion for a directed verdict in a criminal case, the trial court is concerned with the existence or non-existence of evidence, not its weight.Â  State v. Morgan, 282 S.C. 409, 411, 319 S.E.2d 335, 336 (1984).Â  In reviewing the denial of a motion for a directed verdict, the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Fennell, 340 S.C. 266, 270, 531 S.E.2d 512, 514 (2000).Â  If there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, we must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  State v. Pinckney, 339 S.C. 346, 349, 529 S.E.2d 526, 527 (2000).Â  â€œA defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.â€ Â State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 97, 544 S.E.2d 30, 36 (2001).Â  Thus, in the present case, unless it can be said as a matter of law that self-defense or defense of habitation was established, it was not error to submit the case to the jury.\r\nIn order to establish that a crime was committed in self-defense, a defendant must show: \r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) he was without fault in bringing on the difficulty;\r\n(2) he actually believed he was in imminent danger of losing his life or of sustaining serious bodily injury;\r\n(3) a reasonably prudent person of ordinary firmness and courage would have entertained the same belief;\r\n(4) he had no other probable means of avoiding the danger.\r\n\r\nState v. Long, 325 S.C. 59, 62, 480 S.E.2d 62, 63 (1997).Â  Defense of habitation is analogous to self-defense, except that â€œa person attacked on his own premises, without fault, has the right to claim immunity from the law of retreat.â€Â  Id.Â  However, as with self-defense, the defendantâ€™s subjective belief of imminent danger must be reasonable.Â  State v. Lee, 293 S.C. 536, 537, 362 S.E.2d 24, 25 (1987).Â  \r\nHere, the trial court properly submitted the case to the jury because there was evidence that Galbreath did not believe he was in imminent danger of losing life or sustaining serious bodily injury.Â  Dillard, Ayers, and Davis testified that Bates was unarmed.Â  Furthermore, Ayers and Davis stated that Bates approached Galbreathâ€™s house with â€œhis arms out with his hands spread,â€ making the fact that Bates did not have a weapon evident.Â  Dillard testified that Galbreath declared, after the shooting, that he â€œwished [Bates] would have tried to break in,â€ which provides some evidence that Galbreath did not believe Bates was trying to break into his home. Â Therefore, we find the State presented enough evidence to survive a directed verdict motion.Â  Â Â \r\nGalbreath also claims the trial court erred in allowing Officer Chastainâ€™s testimony as rebuttal evidence to the statement Galbreath made to police because the State elicited the statement during cross-examination.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen the defendant has completed his case, the prosecuting party may offer evidence in reply.Â \r\nMcGaha v. Mosley, 283 S.C. 268, 276, 322 S.E.2d 461, 466 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  â€œThe admission of reply testimony is within the sound discretion of the trial judge, and there is no abuse of discretion if the testimony is arguably contradictory of and in reply to earlier testimony.â€Â  State v. Todd, 290 S.C. 212, 214, 349 S.E.2d 339, 340 (1986).Â  Reply testimony can also be used to clarify matters that were confused during the defendantâ€™s case, to rebut an affirmative defense raised during the defendantâ€™s case, and most importantly in this case, to complete the impeachment of a defense witness.Â  See, e.g., State v. Van Williams, 212 S.C. 110, 113, 46 S.E.2d 665, 666-67 (1948); Ford v. A.A.A. Highway Express, 204 S.C. 433, 441-42, 29 S.E.2d 760, 763-64 (1944) (holding plaintiff was on notice that rebuttal evidence may be offered when cross-examination of plaintiffâ€™s witness elicited contradictory evidence).Â  \r\nDuring his testimony, Galbreath stated he heard a â€œbig crashâ€ when Bates threw objects against the garage door.Â  He also heard Bates screaming â€œlike an animal.â€Â  He testified he was afraid for his life because he heard Bates say, â€œIâ€™ll kill you old man.â€Â  Most importantly, Galbreath testified that Bates had a knife when Dillard kicked him and Ayers out of the vehicle.Â  He also testified that he was â€œsorry about the boy.â€ \r\nHowever, during cross-examination, the State presented the statement Galbreath made to Officer Chastain, which detailed many of the events of December 27-28, 2000, including Batesâ€™s threats and the fight in the car. Â In this statement, Galbreath failed to mention that he felt his life was in danger or that Bates was screaming and throwing objects against the garage door.Â  Galbreath also neglected to mention to Officer Chastain, whom he knew well, that Bates had been armed with a knife earlier in the evening.Â  Furthermore, in contrast to what Galbreath testified to at trial, in his statement to Officer Chastain, Galbreath said that he felt sorry for Batesâ€™s mother â€œfor losing a kid, but he didnâ€™t feel bad for [Bates].â€Â Â  \r\nAfter the defense rested its case, the State called Officer Chastain to rebut Galbreathâ€™s testimony.Â Â  Officer Chastainâ€™s testimony impeached Galbreathâ€™s trial testimony because Galbreath did not say the same things on the stand that he had said to Officer Chastain regarding the incident.Â  Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the rebuttal testimony.Â  See Todd, 290 S.C. at 214, 349 S.E.2d at 340 (finding reply testimony was admissible where witnessâ€™s testimony contradicted part of defendantâ€™s testimony).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION&nbsp;\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, Galbreathâ€™s convictions are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-362","title":"Atherton v.

Short, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No.Â  2005-UP-362\r\nHeard May 11, 2005 â€“ Filed May 25, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nChad McGowan and Kevin Sitnik, both of Rock Hill, and Gordon Ball, of Knoxville, for Appellant.\r\nDaniel J. Westbrook and Alice V. Harris, both of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is a class action[1] arising out of the alleged overcharging by Tenet Healthcare Corporation and AMISUB of South Carolina, Inc. (collectively Respondents), for medical services rendered at Piedmont Medical Center.Â  The court granted summary judgment to Respondents on Athertonâ€™s claims of breach of contract, unjust enrichment, implied contract for value, and his request for an injunction.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn 1980, York County, the Trustees of York General Hospital, American Medical International, Inc., and AMISUB of South Carolina, Inc.\r\nentered into a contract for American Medical[2] and AMISUB to lease York General Hospital and to construct a replacement hospital.[3]Â  In section 16.15 of the 1980 contract, it specifies â€œ[t]here are no third party beneficiaries of this Agreement.â€Â  Both parties agree Atherton was not a party to this contract.Â  \r\nThe contract was subsequently modified on seven different occasions, through seven addenda to the 1980 contract.Â  In August 1995, Respondents and York County executed the Sixth Addendum.Â  The Sixth Addendum provided in part that â€œin order to ensure the continuing provision of high quality, cost effective healthcare to the citizens of York County without cost to York County, [Respondents] have proposed to undertake various obligations expanding upon, or in addition to, those contained in [the 1980 Agreement].â€Â  This addendum also contained the following provisions relevant to this appeal:\r\nSection 3.1(e) Pricing\r\nAMI acknowledges that, in addition to the securing of the highest quality health care for the citizens of York County, a major objective of York County in entering into this Agreement is that such care be provided on a cost-effective basis at prices favorably comparable to those paid for similar services provided by comparable acute-care hospitals in the same general geographical area. . . . Both parties understand that cost-effective, competitive pricing for services provided at the Hospital is essential to the provision of quality health care services to the citizens of York County, to the continuing economic well being of the Hospital and to the ability of AMI to meet its obligations hereunder.Â  AMI agrees to exert every effort to so conduct its operations and finances to maintain prices for services at the Hospital at reasonable, competitive levels vis a vis other hospitals in the â€œpeer groupâ€ . . . . In the event such pricing information shall show that the average charge per case by the Hospital for â€œAll Product Linesâ€ is the highest in the peer group, AMI shall, within twelve (12) months following the delivery of such information to York County, present to York County, and implement a plan reasonably expected to fix or reduce its costs and/or charges for services such that the average charge per case for All Product Lines at the Hospital will be less than the highest in such peer group.Â  If such average charge remains the highest in the peer group at the end of the second Medpar reporting period following the reporting period which first showed the Hospitalâ€™s having the highest average charge, AMI shall not increase any charges for services at the Hospital until such time as there have been delivered to York County reports . . . which show the Hospitalâ€™s average charge per case for All Product Lines being less than the highest of the peer group.\r\nSection 4.2 Remedies on Default\r\n\r\n(a) Whenever any event of default . . . shall have happened and be subsisting, York County make (sic) take whatever action at law or in equity may appear necessary or desirable to enforce performance and observance of any obligation, agreement or covenant of [Respondents] under this Agreement.\r\n(b) Whenever any event of default described [in specific sections of the Addendum] shall have happened and be subsisting, York County shall, in addition (sic) any remedy available to is (sic) pursuant to subsection (a), above, have the right . . . to purchase the Hospital.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Importantly, section 5 of the Sixth Addendum â€œratified and confirmedâ€ those sections of the 1980 contract not expressly modified by the addendum.Â  \r\nAtherton and the other class members received medical services at Piedmont Medical Center since the 1995 date of the Sixth Addendum.Â  For each service rendered by the Hospital, Atherton entered into agreements entitled â€œConsent for Treatment and Conditions of Admission.â€Â  These agreements included a provision in which Atherton â€œindividually obligates [himself] to pay the account of the hospital in accordance with the regular rates and terms of the hospital and physicians.â€Â  \r\nIn his complaint, Atherton asserts: â€œFor the last several years, the hospital charges for Tenet and Amisub have been the highest in the group of 10 peer hospitals in the region . . . .â€Â  Atherton alleges that York County entered into the agreement â€œto directly benefit the citizens and residents of York Countyâ€ and that they were â€œthe intended beneficiaries of the agreement between York County and [Respondents].â€Â  He sets forth four causes of action:Â  (1) breach of third-party beneficiary contract; (2) unjust enrichment; (3) breach of implied contract for value of goods and services received; and (4) injunctive relief.Â  Respondents answered setting forth numerous defenses, including the defense that neither Atherton nor the purported class were third-party beneficiaries to the agreement and thus lacked standing to enforce the contract.Â  Additionally, Respondents filed a motion for summary judgment.Â  \r\nFollowing a hearing on the matter, the trial court granted Respondentsâ€™ motion for summary judgment.Â  The court found that there were no third-party beneficiaries under the contract, at best the citizens of York County were incidental beneficiaries, and Atherton did not have a right to enforce the provisions of the contract.Â  The court held Athertonâ€™s claim of unjust enrichment was barred because his assertion was based on an alleged breach of a contract, he asserted no legal duty or obligation upon which to base such a claim, and he was attempting to establish an additional remedy not provided for under the contract.Â  \r\nThe court went on to find neither South Carolina, nor any other jurisdiction, has recognized a cause of action for the breach of an implied contract for value of goods and services received, and even if it did exist, Athertonâ€™s claim fails because his payments were covered by express contracts with the Hospital.Â  The court also concluded he was not entitled to injunctive relief.Â  Finally, the court held all four of Athertonâ€™s claims would require the court to engage in legislative â€œrate-makingâ€ in order to determine damages, in violation of the separation of powers doctrine, and Respondents were entitled to summary judgment on this basis as well on all four causes of action.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard which governs the trial court:Â  summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Baughman v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 114-15, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545 (1991).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, 61, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998).Â  On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.Â  Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAtherton contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Respondents on his four claims.Â  We disagree.\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Breach of Third-Party Beneficiary Contract\r\nAtherton contends the trial court erred in finding the agreement between Respondents and York County clearly and unambiguously precluded third-party beneficiaries.Â  He argues the Sixth Addendum modified the 1980 contract such that it now allows for enforcement of its provisions by citizens of the county.Â  He maintains, in the alternative, the agreement is at least ambiguous as to whether the citizens of York County are third party beneficiaries such that summary judgment was improper.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œSouth Carolina contract law carries a presumption that an individual who is not a party to a contract lacks privity to enforce it.â€Â  Trancik v. USAA Ins. Co., 354 S.C. 549, 553, 581 S.E.2d 858, 861 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing Touchberry v. City of Florence, 295 S.C. 47, 48-49, 367 S.E.2d 149, 150 (1988)).Â  â€œ[I]t is to be observed that the presumption is that parties contract for their own benefit, and not for that of others not parties to the contract.â€Â  Ancrum v. Camden Water, Light &amp; Ice Co., 82 S.C. 284, 295, 64 S.E. 151, 155 (1909).Â  â€œGenerally, one not in privity of contract with another cannot maintain an action against him in breach of contract, and any damage resulting from the breach of a contract between the defendant and a third party is not, as such, recoverable by the plaintiff.â€Â  Bob Hammond Constr. Co. v. Banks Constr. Co., 312 S.C. 422, 424, 440 S.E.2d 890, 891 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  The presumption is sustained that a contract made by a public entity is made on behalf of the public at large, and not for the benefit of the individual citizens.Â  Ancrum, 82 S.C. at 295, 64 S.E. at 155.Â  However, the presumption may be overcome if the intent of the parties to the contract was to provide the third-party a direct benefit, rather than an incidental or consequential one.Â  Id. at 424, 440 S.E.2d at 891; Cothran v. Rock Hill, 211 S.C. 17, 20, 43 S.E.2d 615, 616-17 (1947).Â  In addition, a municipality or other public entity may enter into a contract which allows for enforcement by an individual citizen if the parties so intended such enforcement and provided for the relief sought by the third-party.Â  Ancrum, 82 S.C. at 295, 64 S.E. at 155; Peeples v. South Carolina Power Co., 166 S.C. 150, 156-58, 164 S.E. 605, 607-08 (1932).\r\nThe cardinal rule of contract interpretation is to ascertain and give legal effect to the intentions of the parties, as determined by the contract language.Â  Schulmeyer v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., 353 S.C. 491, 495, 579 S.E.2d 132, 134 (2003).Â  Courts are without authority to alter a contract by construction or to make new contracts for the parties, and words cannot be read into a contract which impart an intent wholly unexpressed when the contract was executed.Â  Gilstrap v. Culpepper, 283 S.C. 83, 86, 320 S.E.2d 445, 447 (1984).Â  â€œWhen a contract is unambiguous a court must construe its provisions according to the terms the parties used; understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense.â€Â  Schulmeyer, 353 S.C. at 134, 579 S.E.2d at 495.\r\nIn the instant case, there is no indication the parties intended to provide individual citizens with the right to enforce the contract or to hold Respondents liable to individual citizens for a breach of the contract.Â  The 1980 contract specifically and explicitly excludes third-party beneficiaries from the contract.Â  In section 16.15 of the contract, it specifies â€œ[t]here are no third party beneficiaries of this agreement.â€Â  Although the 1995 Sixth Addendum has provisions for pricing such as section 3.1(e) that may provide a consequential benefit to individual citizens of York County, the addendum does nothing to change the partiesâ€™ express intention to prohibit third-party beneficiaries.[4]Â  The addendum fully adopts and ratifies the unmodified portions of the 1980 contract, which includes section 16.15 limiting third-party beneficiaries.Â  \r\nFurther, unlike Peeples, which is relied on by Atherton, default provision section 4.2 of the Sixth Addendum provides for specific remedies reserved to York County alone.Â  The public contract in Peeples â€œ[did] not expressly provide the consequences of a breach, so as to exclude other consequences.â€Â  Peeples, 166 S.C. at 158, 164 S.E. at 607.Â  As noted in Ancrum, whenever parties to a contract stipulate in the contract the consequences of a breach of the agreement, if the stipulation is reasonable, it is controlling and excludes other consequences.Â  Ancrum, 82 S.C. at 297, 64 S.E. at 156.Â  Neither section 4.2, nor any other proviso in the contract or addendum, provide for individual rights of enforcement or remedies in the event of a breach.Â  Rather, the contract in question fixed and limited the consequences of any breach by Respondents, and as noted by the trial court, â€œthe court cannot add to the contract by imposing other and additional consequences.â€Â  Id.Â  As the contract specifies a remedy, and reserves that remedy exclusively to York County, we find this case clearly distinguishable from Peeples.Â  Accordingly, we find the agreement between the parties is unambiguous and the parties did not intend to allow Respondents to be liable to individual citizens of York County.Â  Therefore, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to Respondents on Athertonâ€™s claim for breach of contract. \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Unjust Enrichment\r\nAtherton asserts the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on its claim for unjust enrichment.Â  He maintains the claim is not required to be based upon a legal duty owed by Respondents and is not rooted in his claim for breach of contract.Â  We find the court properly granted summary judgment on Athertonâ€™s claim for unjust enrichment.\r\n Quantum meruit, quasi-contract, and implied by law contract are all equivalent terms for invoking an equitable remedy.Â  Myrtle Beach Hospital, Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 341 S.C. 1, 8, 532 S.E.2d 868, 872 (2000).Â  Our Supreme Court has noted:Â  â€œwe used the terms quantum meruit, quasi-contract, and contract implied by law as equivalent terms, to distinguish those situations where equity would aid recovery from those where law provided the remedy, that is, express contracts or contracts implied in fact.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œIn a law action, the measure of damages is determined by the partiesâ€™ agreement, while in equity, â€˜the measure of the recovery is the extent of the duty or obligation imposed by law, and is expressed by the amount which the court considers the defendant has been unjustly enriched at the expense of the plaintiff.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting United States Rubber Products, Inc. v. Town of Batesburg, 183 S.C. 49, 190 S.E. 120 (1937)).\r\nTo prevail on a quantum meruit/quasi contract/implied by law claim, the plaintiff must establish the following elements:Â  (1) a benefit conferred by the plaintiff upon the defendant; (2) realization of that benefit by the defendant; and (3) retention of the benefit by the defendant under circumstances that make it inequitable for him to retain it without paying its value.Â  Id. at 8-9, 532 S.E.2d at 872.Â  It should be noted, however, â€œ[i]f the tasks the plaintiff is seeking compensation for under a quantum meruit theory are encompassed within the terms of an express contract which has not been abandoned or rescinded, the plaintiff may not recover under quantum meruit.â€Â  Swanson v. Stratos, 350 S.C. 116, 122, 564 S.E.2d 117, 120 (Ct. App. 2002) (citing with approval 66 Am. Jur. 2d Restitution and Implied Contracts Â§ 81 (2001)) (â€œ[I]t is a defense to an action in quantum meruit that there is an express contract covering the issue of compensation for services or materials furnished.â€).\r\nAtherton contends the trial court erred in ruling he could not maintain a claim for unjust enrichment based on an alleged breach of contract.Â  He asserts he is not prohibited from maintaining an unjust enrichment claim by the agreement between York County and Respondents because he is not a party to that contract.Â  While the order of the trial court appears to be referring to the agreement between York County and Respondents when it sets forth the law that one cannot recover for unjust enrichment where an express contract exists, this is due to the fact Atherton couched his complaint as relying on this agreement to show Respondents were unjustly enriched.Â  Specifically, in asserting his unjust enrichment claim, Athertonâ€™s allegations in entirety are as follows:\r\n\r\n53.Â  Defendant wrongfully charged the Plaintiff and every other person similarly situated to the Plaintiff when it insisted upon a price for medical services which was in excess of the highest amount of any hospital in the 10 member peer group as agreed to by contract with York County.Â  The defendants have paid the money for charges which were in abrogation of the agreement with York County and, thus, Tenet and Amisub have been unjustly enriched.\r\n54.Â  Plaintiff is individually entitled to judgment in their (sic) favor against the Defendants in the amount of all charges by Piedmont Medical Center that were in excess of the highest amount of any hospital in the 10 member peer group, plus reasonable interest, and each person in a class of persons similarly situated is entitled to judgment in their (sic) favor against the Defendants in the amount of all charges by Piedmont Medical Center that were in excess of the highest amount of any hospital in the 10 member peer group.\r\n\r\nThus, Atherton has based his claim for unjust enrichment on the agreement between York County and Respondents.Â  As previously noted, this express contract precludes any recovery by Atherton as a third-party beneficiary under the contract.Â  Clearly, as noted by the trial court, Atherton is merely attempting to reframe his breach of contract action as an action for unjust enrichment.Â  \r\nAt any rate, we find in the instant case there are other express contracts, which cover the issue of the amount paid by Atherton to the Hospital in exchange for its medical services, that preclude Athertonâ€™s claim for unjust enrichment.[5]Â  Atherton signed consent agreements in which he agreed to â€œpay the account of the hospital in accordance with the regular rates and terms of the hospital and physicians.â€Â  He cannot now claim recovery under an implied contract when he and the Hospital each performed under an express contract which was neither abandoned nor rescinded.Â  \r\nFinally, even if we went beyond the issue of express contracts covering the issue of compensation for services furnished, Athertonâ€™s claim must fail.Â  In Pitts v. Jackson Natâ€™l Life Ins. Co., 352 S.C. 319, 574 S.E.2d 502 (Ct. App. 2002), Pitts sued Jackson National asserting, in part, a claim for unjust enrichment based on the insurance companyâ€™s failure to issue a preferred policy instead of a standard policy on his daughter, because his daughter qualified for the preferred policy, which charged lower premiums than the standard policies of equal face value.Â  This court noted the elements that a plaintiff must establish in order to recover for unjust enrichment; i.e. that there be (1) a benefit conferred by the plaintiff upon the defendant; (2) realization of that benefit by the defendant; and (3) retention of the benefit by the defendant under circumstances that make it inequitable for him to retain it without paying its value.Â  Id.Â  at 339, 574 S.E.2d at 512.Â  We found that there was no benefit conferred upon the insurance company that would be unjust for the company to retain.Â  Id.Â  As in Pitts, there simply is no benefit conferred upon Respondents that would be unjust for Respondents to retain.Â  Atherton entered into commercial transactions with Respondents whereby he agreed to pay the hospitalâ€™s and physiciansâ€™ â€œregular ratesâ€ in exchange for services rendered to him.Â  There is no allegation the Hospital was unjustly enriched by taking more than its â€œregular rates,â€ only that it took more than was allowed in the contract between Respondents and York County.Â  If Atherton were allowed to recover on this basis, it would expose Respondents to individual liability on a contract that we have found expressly prohibits individual recovery.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court properly granted Respondentsâ€™ motion for summary judgment on Athertonâ€™s claim of unjust enrichment. \r\nIII.Â Â Â  Implied Contract for Value of Goods and Services Received\r\nAtherton maintains the trial court erred in finding no cause of action for breach of an implied contract for value of goods and services received may be sustained.Â  We disagree.\r\nAtherton maintains this cause of action is merely a reverse quantum meruit cause of action in which someone who pays too much for a service is entitled to a refund of the amount overpaid.Â  However, as stated above, a plaintiff may not recover under a quantum meruit cause of action where there is an express contract covering the issue of compensation.Â  Swanson v. Stratos, 350 S.C. at 122, 564 S.E.2d at 120.Â  Atherton entered into express contracts with the Hospital to pay at the â€œregular ratesâ€ for the services rendered.Â  When he paid the rate charged, he performed under the contract.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Atherton admits this specific cause of action has not been a â€œrecognized cause of action.â€Â  We have found no jurisdiction adopting liability for breach of the implied contract for value of goods and services received and Atherton fails to cite any case which analyzes and/or adopts such a cause of action in South Carolina or any other state.Â  In spite of this lack of precedent, Atherton maintains the court should â€œfashion an equitable remedy.â€Â  However, we find Atherton properly contracted for the services and paid for the services based upon the consent agreements with the Hospital.Â  There is no need to create a new cause of action in equity when the contracts between Atherton and the Hospital expressly cover the issue of payment.\r\nAtherton asks this court, however, to declare the consent agreements void for indefiniteness because the consent agreements fail to properly set forth the price terms.Â  Atherton relies on Doe v. HCA Health Servs. of Tenn., Inc., 46 S.W.3d 191 (Tenn. 2001) for the proposition that where the price is not set but only states the patient assumed liability for charges not paid by insurance, the contract is unenforceable for indefiniteness.Â  However, in Doe, the patient refused to pay the amount billed when it was presented, and instead filed suit seeking to determine a reasonable rate.Â  Id. at 194-95.Â  In the instant case, the record indicates Atherton paid the amount billed by the Hospital.Â  Therefore, there was a meeting of the minds regarding the price and nothing in the record indicates otherwise.Â  \r\nFinally, we have determined Atherton cannot meet the elements necessary in order to recover for unjust enrichment.Â  Because Atherton maintains this cause of action is simply a reverse quantum meruit cause of action, this cause of action fails on that basis as well.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court properly granted summary judgment on Athertonâ€™s claim of breach of the implied contract for value of goods or services received.\r\nIV.Â Â Â  Injunction\r\nAtherton asserts the trial court erred in ruling he was not entitled to injunctive relief.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe remedy of injunction is a drastic one and should be cautiously applied only when legal rights are unlawfully invaded or legal duties are willfully or wantonly neglected.â€Â  LeFurgy v. Long Cove Club Owners Assâ€™n, Inc., 313 S.C. 555, 558, 443 S.E.2d 577, 578 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  In his complaint, Atherton asserts he is entitled to an injunction enjoining Respondents from seeking fees in excess of that allowed by provisions of the Sixth Addendum to the contract between York County and Respondents.Â  The trial court correctly determined Atherton is attempting to enforce, by way of an injunction, a contract that he has no legal right to enforce.Â  As discussed above, the contract between York County and Respondents allows enforcement by York County and provides the relief allowed.Â  Based upon our holdings above, we find no reason in equity to impose an injunction on Respondents.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court properly granted summary judgment to Respondents on Athertonâ€™s request for injunctive relief.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court properly determined Atherton was not a direct third-party beneficiary under the contract between York County and Respondents and therefore has no right of enforcement.Â  We also find Atherton was not entitled to recover under a theory of unjust enrichment or the unprecedented theory of a breach of an implied contract for value of goods or services received.Â  Finally, we hold Atherton was not entitled to injunctive relief in seeking to require Respondents to abide by the terms of the contract or addendum.Â  Accordingly, we find the order of the trial court granting summary judgment to Respondents on all of Athertonâ€™s claims is\r\nAFFIRMED.[6]\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]For purposes of this appeal, the class allegations are irrelevant.Â  \r\n[2]National Medical Enterprises subsequently acquired American Medical and thereafter changed its name to Tenet Healthcare Corporation.Â  \r\n[3]The replacement hospital is Piedmont Medical Center, which Respondents still operate as of the time of this action.Â  \r\n[4]While the Sixth Addendum provides it was entered in part to ensure the continuing provision of high quality, cost effective healthcare to the citizens of York County, this provision merely expresses the intention to benefit the public at large.Â  We note the 1980 contract also was generally entered into in order to provide certain benefits to the citizens of York County as a whole.Â  Indeed, one provision of the 1980 contract expressly requires Respondents to provide an ambulance service at no charge to the county â€œto meet the needs of all citizens of York County. . . .â€Â  However, the Agreement specifically excludes third-party beneficiaries. \r\n[5] This court may affirm pursuant to any ground appearing in the record on appeal.Â  See Rule 220(c), SCACR ( â€œThe appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.â€).\r\n[6]Based on our determination the trial court properly granted summary judgment on each of the individual causes of action, we need not address Athertonâ€™s assertion the trial court committed error in determining Respondents were entitled to summary judgment collectively as to all four causes of action because Athertonâ€™s claims would require the court to engage in legislative â€œrate-makingâ€ in order to determine damages, in violation of the separation of powers doctrine.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-363","title":"Hendricks v.

Johnson, of Okatie, for Appellant.Â  \r\nMichael R. Ragsdale, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Carl C. Hendricks, Jr. appeals an order finding two payments he made to Michael Ragsdale were not loans.Â  In addition, Hendricks appeals an order denying him relief from judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)(3), SCRCP.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nHendricks filed two actions to collect money based on alleged loans of $60,000 and $25,000 made to Ragsdale.Â  By consent, the actions were consolidated and the master conducted a trial on the merits.Â  By order dated January 16, 2001, the master concluded the payments to Ragsdale were not loans.Â  \r\nThe master found that in January of 1990, Hendricks, Ralph Tupper, and Scott Williams borrowed approximately $60,000 from the Savings Bank of Beaufort County.Â  Approximately $30,000 was used to pay a delinquent debt owed by Ragsdale.Â  The remaining $30,000 was paid to Hendricks and Tupper, who endorsed a check in favor of Ragsdale.Â  Hendricks subsequently borrowed an additional $25,000 from South Carolina Federal.Â  The proceeds from this loan were likewise distributed for the benefit of Ragsdale. \r\nAccording to the master, there was strongly divergent testimony between the parties as to the disbursements.Â  The master found Ragsdale was more credible.Â  The master concluded, therefore, that the payments were paid â€œto meet a business purpose, and in order to obtain further credit to finance [Hendricksâ€™] interest in forming a new automobile dealershipâ€ or â€œwere business related expenses, or . . . otherwise authorized as compensation of Mr. Ragsdale.â€Â  Accordingly, the master found the payments did not constitute loans.Â  \r\nHendricks appealed the masterâ€™s order.Â  While the appeal was pending, Hendricks moved this court to hold the appeal in abeyance to enable Hendricks to file a Rule 60(b)(3) motion for relief from judgment.Â  This court held the appeal in abeyance and Hendricks filed his motion, arguing Ragsdale offered perjurious testimony at the trial.Â  Finding the alleged perjured testimony would constitute intrinsic fraud, the circuit court denied the motion.Â  Hendricks appeals both the order finding the payments were not loans and the order denying his Rule 60(b)(3) motion. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Existence of Indebtedness\r\nHendricks argues the evidence in the record does not reasonably support the masterâ€™s finding that the payments to Ragsdale were not loans.Â  We disagree. \r\nâ€œAn action to recover on a promissory note is . . . an action at law.â€Â \r\nChambers v. Pingree, 351 S.C. 442, 449, 570 S.E.2d 528, 532 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.â€Â \r\nTownes Assocs. v. City of Greenville,\r\n266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  Based on the record provided and the detailed findings of fact in the masterâ€™s order, we conclude evidence existed to support the masterâ€™s conclusion that the payments made to Ragsdale were not loans.Â  \r\nThe master found, and Hendricks does not refute, the alleged loans were not reduced to writing and no written evidence exists to indicate Ragsdale agreed to repay Hendricks.Â  Ragsdale testified that he left a job paying him $60,000 per year to assist Hendricks in finding an automobile dealership.Â  Ragsdale further testified the payments from Hendricks were compensation for his efforts.Â  We find evidence in the record to support the masterâ€™s findings that the amounts paid by Hendricks were not loans.Â  \r\nII.Â  Rule 60(b)\r\nHendricks also argues the trial court erred in denying him relief from judgment under Rule 60(b)(3), SCRCP.Â  We disagree.Â  Hendricks alleges Ragsdale offered perjured testimony at trial, and therefore, Hendricks is entitled to relief from the judgment.Â  The trial court denied Hendricksâ€™ motion based on Raby Construction v. Orr, 358 S.C. 10, 594 S.E.2d 478 (2004), and Chewning v. Ford Motor Co., 354 S.C. 72, 579 S.E.2d 605 (2003).Â  \r\n\r\nRule 60(b) provides:Â  \r\n  \r\n(b) Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly Discovered Evidence; Fraud, etc.Â  On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n  . . . .\r\n\r\n  (3) fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party;\r\n  \r\n\r\nRule 60(b), SCRCP.\r\nIn Chewning v. Ford Motor Co., the South Carolina Supreme\r\nCourt announced: &quot;In order to secure equitable relief on the basis of\r\nfraud, the fraud must be extrinsic.&quot; 354 S.C. 72, 80, 579 S.E.2d 605, 610\r\n(2003). Further, the court explained the distinction between extrinsic and\r\nintrinsic fraud:&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  Extrinsic fraud is fraud that induces a person not to\r\n  present a case or deprives a person of the opportunity to be heard. Relief is\r\n  granted for extrinsic fraud on the theory that because the fraud prevented a\r\n  party from fully exhibiting and trying his case, there has never been a real\r\n  contest before the court on the subject matter of the action.\r\nIntrinsic fraud, on the other hand, is fraud which was presented and considered in the trial.Â  It is fraud which misleads a court in determining issues and induces the court to find for the party perpetrating the fraud.\r\n\r\nId. at 81, 579 S.E.2d at 610 (internal quotations and citations omitted).Â  The court specifically found that perjury by a party or a witness is intrinsic fraud.Â  Id.  \r\nIn Raby Construction v. Orr, the appellant argued that the intrinsic/extrinsic rule from Raby applied only if the Rule 60(b) attack on judgment was more than one year old.Â  358 S.C. 10, 17, 594 S.E.2d 478, 481 (2004).Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court rejected this argument:Â  â€œSouth Carolina maintains the distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic fraud, even when the allegations are raised through a Rule 60(b)(3) motion filed within one year of the entry of judgment.â€Â  Raby, 358 S.C. at 20, 594 S.E.2d at 483.Â  \r\nHendricks filed a petition with this court to argue against precedent.Â  Article V section 9 of the South Carolina Constitution, governing the jurisdiction of the court of appeals, provides:Â  â€œThe Court of Appeals shall have such jurisdiction as the General Assembly shall prescribe by general law.Â  The decisions of the Supreme Court shall bind the Court of Appeals as precedents.â€Â  S.C. Const. Art. V, Â§ 9 (1985).Â  Thus, we are bound by the precedent established in Raby and Chewning.Â  Under these cases, we find the trial court correctly found Hendricks was not entitled to relief from judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)(3).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the record supports the masterâ€™s findings that payments made to Ragsdale by Hendricks were not loans.Â  In addition, we find the trial court did not err in denying Hendricksâ€™ request for relief from judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)(3), SCRCP.Â  Accordingly, the orders on appeal are\r\n AFFIRMED. \r\nANDERSON, STILWELL, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-364","title":"Lollis v.

Lollis, as personal representatives of the Estate of Billy E. Lollis, Jr., appeal the circuit courtâ€™s order affirming the Appellate Panel of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (Full Commission).Â  Appellants argue the circuit court erred in finding Billy E. Lollis, Jr. was barred, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-60 (1985), from receiving workersâ€™ compensation benefits because voluntary intoxication was the proximate cause of the accident.Â  \r\nAfter a thorough review of the record, the decision of the circuit court, and the briefs of the parties, we find the circuit court properly concluded there was substantial evidence to support the Full Commissionâ€™s finding that intoxication was the proximate cause of the accident.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s order is hereby affirmed and reprinted as part of the opinion of this Court.[1]\r\nTHE ORDER OF JUDGE ALEXANDER S. MACAULAY\r\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThis matter came before me on an appeal from the Full Commission of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission. The claimant filed a form 50 on November 14, 2000, alleging an injury by accident, resulting in severe head trauma. The employer/carrier answered, admitting that the claimant was an employee and in the scope of his employment at the time of his injury, but interposing an affirmative defense of voluntary intoxication as a bar to recovery.Â  (See S.C. Code Ann. Â§42-9-60, 1985, as amended). The employer/carrier contended that the claimant was so intoxicated and impaired on the day in question that he was incapable of operating a bulldozer safely, and as a direct and proximate\r\nresult of this intoxication, drove the bulldozer too close to theÂ edge of a pit, causing the equipment to slide down into the pit and unfortunately injuring the claimant.\r\nCommissioner Catoe heard the case and issued his Decision and Order on February 8, 2002, finding that the employer/carrier failed to meet their burden of proof that intoxication was the proximate cause of the accident. The Full Commission reversed the Single Commissioner by Order dated August 26, 2002, finding that the claimantâ€™s level of intoxication and impairment was so great that he was incapable of operating a bulldozer safely and that the accident was a direct and proximate result of his intoxication. \r\nBy Notice of Appeal dated September 10, 2002, the claimant timely appealed to this Court as authorized by South Carolina law. At the hearing before this Court on August 28, 2003, the claimantâ€™s intoxication was conceded, and argument was focused on the issue of proximate cause.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis Court is not permitted to substitute its view of the evidence for that of the Full Commission. S.C. Code Ann. Â§1-23-380(g), 1976, as amended; rather it is constrained to determine if the decision below is controlled by an error of law or if it is wholly unsupported by any evidence.Â  Hoxit v. Michelin Tire Corp., 304 S.C. 461, 405 S.E.2d 407 (1991), Oâ€™Banner vs. Westinghouse Electric Corporation, 319 S.C. 24, 459 S.E. 2d 324 (Ct. App. 1995). The Commissionâ€™s decision must be affirmed if the findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence in the record.Â  Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 519 S.E. 2d 102 (1999). The final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the Commission.Â  Where there is conflict in the evidence, the Commissionâ€™s findings of fact are conclusive.Â  Id.\r\nThe claimant was in an accident when the bulldozer he was driving slid down into a pit [o]n the morning in question. The claimant was then transported to Spartanburg Regional Medical Center, where his blood alcohol content was measured at more than three times the level of presumed intoxication, .308 grams per 100 milliliters, or as commonly referenced, a .308 BAC.Â  (For simplicityâ€™s sake the Court will refer to this reading as a .31%.)\r\nThe claimant contested his intoxication before the Single Commissioner, even in light of a blood alcohol level of .31%; and further contended that the bulldozer slid because of unstable ground, which would have occurred had he been operating the bulldozer while sober. At the hearing before the Single Commissioner, Steve Sease, an experienced operator of heavy equipment, testified that after viewing the scene, it was his opinion that the claimant had gotten too close to the edge of a pit, had tried to go down the slope and then lost control.Â  He further stated it was not routine to drive a bulldozer down into a pit, and that the claimant had never done so before this accident.Â  While the claimantâ€™s witnesses struggled mightily to characterize the event as unavoidable due to the collapse of unstable ground around the edge of the pit, they gave significantly conflicting testimony. The Full Commission reviewed this and other evidence in the record, and concluded that the claimantâ€™s intoxication was the proximate cause of the accident. The Full Commission is the ultimate finder of fact in workersâ€™ compensation cases[.]Â  Ross v. American Red Cross, 298 S.C. 490, 381 S.E.2d 728 (1989).Â  There was ample testimony in the record to support the Commissionâ€™s finding that the bulldozer tumbled into the pit because it was being operated by a grossly intoxicated driver who should have known better than to approach as closely to the edge as he did.[2]Â  The real question is whether this Court, sitting in appellate jurisdiction, can overturn the findings of the Full Commission when it is indisputable that the record contains substantial evidence to support its findings. The disposition of this case before this Court is determined by the standard of review.Â Â  \r\nThis Court, sitting in appellate jurisdiction, only has the power to correct decisions below that are controlled by an error of law, wholly unsupported by any evidence, or are arbitrary or capricious. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§1-23-380, 1976, as amended.Â  While the claimant/appellant concedes that the evidence below supported the Full Commissionâ€™s finding regarding the claimantâ€™s intoxication, he urges that the decision below is controlled by an error of law regarding proximate cause.Â  However, South Carolina law has many years of well-established precedent that questions of proximate cause are always questions to be resolved by the finder of fact.Â  See Olsen v. Faculty House of South Carolina, Inc., 344 S.C. 194, 544 S.E.2d 38 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Here, the Full Commission having found that the fall down into the pit was occasioned by a piece of heavy equipment being operated by a grossly impaired operator, this court is not permitted to set aside that finding if it is supported by evidence, even if this Court is inclined to disagree with the decision reached by the Full Commission.Â  Consider the hypothetical parallel situation in which an impaired operator of an automobile slides off a dangerous curve causing injury to his passenger.Â  While the operator may argue that a sober driver would also have slid off the same curve, it is impossible to ignore the fact that a driver operating a motor vehicle under the effects of alcohol could not escape liability for driving while drunk.Â  Thus if a jury concluded on such evidence that the reason the driver slid off the curb and injured his passenger [sic], an appellate court would not be permitted to set such a verdict aside even if it disagreed with the decision reached by the finder of fact.Â  The same analysis applies here. It is possibleâ€”and even plausibleâ€”that a sober operator might carelessly drive a bulldozer into a pit and thereby injure himself, but when the event occurs involving a grossly drunk operator, the logical inference cannot be escaped that the operatorâ€™s muddled condition was the proximate cause of the accident. \r\nTherefore, no matter whether this Court agrees or disagrees with the decision of the Full Commission, the Full Commission is the finder of fact. Having reviewed the record in detail, and listened to the arguments of counsel, this Court is unable to identify either a controlling error of law or the dearth of substantial evidence to support the decision below. Moreover, the decision below cannot be labeled as being either capricious or arbitrary.\r\nFor these reasons the decision of the Full Commission is affirmed.\r\nThe Court of Appeals, having adopted the decision of the circuit court as noted above, holds the judgment is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  The record before the Single Commissioner reflects various questions and answers relating to the complexity of safely operating a bulldozer. This Court accepts, without reciting the various witnessesâ€™ testimony regarding the operation of bulldozers, the self-evident notion that bulldozers are heavy, complex, and dangerous instrumentalities, and that if our law does not permit drivers to operate automobiles if under the influence of alcohol, the reasons for such a rule are equallyâ€”if not more soâ€”applicable to heavy construction equipment. The claimant in the present case had consumed so much alcohol prior to operating the bulldozer that he could not remember what he drank or in what quantity, other than it was at least a twelve pack of beer, and additional liquor and beer after that, describing the amount consumed as â€œa bunch[.â€]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-365","title":"Maxwell v.

Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).Â  We affirm, finding the trial courtâ€™s ruling was not clearly erroneous.\r\nFACTS\r\nThis action began as a result of an August 2000 motor vehicle accident.Â  Felicia Maxwell alleged the South Carolina Department of Transportation (DOT) was negligent in leaving cut grass and debris in the roadway, which caused her to lose control of her vehicle and hit a tree.Â  The case proceeded to trial in November 2003, and the jury ultimately returned a verdict finding Maxwell was 80 percent at fault and DOT was 20 percent at fault.Â  Because Maxwellâ€™s comparative fault exceeded 50 percent, judgment was entered in favor of DOT.Â  \r\nDuring jury selection, Maxwell, who is an African American, used her four peremptory strikes to strike four white potential jurors, and DOT used its four strikes to strike four black potential jurors.Â  The jury eventually seated was composed of ten white jurors and two African Americans.Â  Motions pursuant to Batson v. Kentucky were made by both parties.Â  These motions were denied after a Batson hearing.Â  At the conclusion of the trial, Maxwell moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, alternatively, for a new trial on several grounds, including the alleged Batson violation.Â  These motions were denied, and Maxwell appeals.[1]\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\nMaxwell argues the circuit court erred by allowing DOT to exercise peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the striking of a potential juror on the basis of race.Â  State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 615, 545 S.E.2d 805, 810 (2001).Â  When a party strikes a member of a cognizable racial group and the opposing party requests, the circuit court must hold a Batson hearing.Â  Id.  \r\nThe proper procedure and standard for a Batson hearing was set out by our supreme court in State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996).Â  The court has more recently summarized the procedure as follows: \r\n\r\nAfter a party objects to a jury strike, the proponent of the strike must offer a facially race-neutral explanation. This explanation is not required to be persuasive or even plausible. Once the proponent states a reason that is race-neutral, the burden is on the party challenging the strike to show the explanation is mere pretext, either by showing similarly situated members of another race were seated on the jury or the reason given for the strike is so fundamentally implausible as to constitute mere pretext despite a lack of disparate treatment.\r\nThe trial judgeâ€™s findings of purposeful discrimination rest largely on his evaluation of demeanor and credibility, and the reviewing court should give the findings great deference on appeal.Â  However, where the record does not support the trial courtâ€™s findings, the findings must be overturned.Â  Whether a Batson violation occurred must be determined by examining the totality of the facts and circumstances in the record surrounding the strike.Â  The composition of the jury panel is a factor that may be considered when determining whether a party engaged in purposeful discrimination.\r\n\r\nState v. Ford, 334 S.C. 59, 64-65, 512 S.E.2d 500, 503 (1999) (citations omitted).Â  The opponent of the strike carries the ultimate burden of persuading the trial court the challenged party exercised strikes in a discriminatory manner. Adams, 322 S.C. at 124, 470 S.E.2d at 372. Appellate courts view the trial courtâ€™s findings on Batson motions with great deference, and will overturn the trial courtâ€™s ruling only upon a showing of clear error.Â  State v. Rayfield, 357 S.C. 497, 502, 593 S.E.2d 486, 489 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nIn this case, Maxwell challenged DOTâ€™s peremptory strikes because all four were used to remove African Americans as jurors.Â  The trial court conducted a Batson hearing following the procedures outlined in State v. Adams.Â  DOT first offered an explanation for each of its peremptory strikes.Â  Finding the reasons stated by DOT to be facially race-neutral, the burden thus shifted to Maxwell to prove the explanations offered by DOT were mere pretext.Â  The trial court found Maxwell failed to satisfy this burden.Â  Her motion to quash the jury was therefore denied.\r\nHaving thoroughly reviewed the record, we find no clear error with the findings of the trial court concerning Maxwellâ€™s Batson challenge.\r\nFirst, DOTâ€™s reasons for striking the four jurors were facially race-neutral.Â  DOT explained that each of the jurors it excused was struck due to his or her lack of education as discerned from the nature of their employment, their age, demeanor, or a combination of these factors.Â  These explanations are racially neutral, legitimate reasons for exercising peremptory strikes. See State v. Tucker, 334 S.C. 1, 8, 512 S.E.2d 99, 102 (1999) (holding that â€œ[u]nless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the proponentâ€™s explanation, the reason offered will be deemed race-neutralâ€); Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. 51, 55, 495 S.E.2d 205, 207 (1998) (holding same). We therefore find no clear error in the trial courtâ€™s finding as to this threshold determination.Â  \r\nNext, Maxwell failed to carry her burden of proving these explanations were mere pretext.Â  Maxwell makes two arguments here.Â  First, she claims that DOTâ€™s reasons were fundamentally implausible.Â  Maxwell argues that DOTâ€™s assertion that the jurors had a limited education should have been rejected because there was no direct information concerning their education, and it was improper for DOT to draw conclusions about the prospective jurorsâ€™ education or ability based solely upon the nature of their employment.Â  We disagree.Â  Our supreme court has noted that parties must be permitted some latitude when exercising peremptory challenges.Â  Parties â€œmust be allowed to make credibility determinationsâ€ when evaluating jurors and must be allowed to consider intangible factors such as the â€œtone, demeanor, facial expression, and any other race-neutral factors when striking jurors.â€ Tucker, 334 S.C. at 9, 512 S.E.2d at 103; State v. Wright, 354 S.C. 48, 56, 579 S.E.2d 538, 542 (Ct. App. 2003), overruled on other grounds by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005); see also State v. Casey, 325 S.C. 447, 456, 481 S.E.2d 169, 174 (Ct. App. 1997) (noting that â€œ[n]either Batson nor its progeny requires that the proponent of a strike present evidentiary support for the strikeâ€).Â  Accordingly, a party challenging a peremptory strike must do more than merely allege an absence of hard facts or documented evidence to support the reasons given for striking a juror.Â  Maxwellâ€™s broad claims that DOTâ€™s reasons for exercising its peremptory strikes were based on assumption and surmise fall short of showing clear error by the trial court in finding DOTâ€™s explanations were not pretext.[2]\r\nSecond, Maxwell argues the reasons for the strikes were pretext because similarly-situated, non-African-American jurors were seated on the jury.Â  Viewing the record in light of our standard of review, we find no clear error in the trial courtâ€™s rejection of this argument.Â  Although we recognize that some non-African-American jurors seated on the jury wereâ€”broadly speakingâ€”similarly situated to the stricken jurors in that they too arguably lacked significant education or experience, DOT distinguished the seated jurors by the fact that they held positions involving some degree of enhanced responsibility or skillâ€”such as those with management duties or the self-employed.Â  These were proper race-neutral considerations.Â  \r\nTherefore, mindful of the deference that we must give to the trial court, we find no reversible error in the trial courtâ€™s determination that DOTâ€™s reasons for striking these jurors were not pretext.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that Maxwell has not carried her burden of persuasion in proving DOT engaged in purposeful discrimination during the jury selection process.Â  After carefully reviewing the explanations asserted by DOT counsel and the objections raised by Maxwell, we find no basis to conclude the ruling of the trial court was clearly erroneous.Â  The trial courtâ€™s denial of the Batson motion is therefore\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â  [1] Maxwell raises only the Batson issue to this court.Â  The other grounds for her JNOV and new trial motions are not at issue in this appeal.\r\nÂ Â Â Â  [2] In her brief to this court, Maxwell raises two arguments that were not presented to the trial court during the Batson hearing or at any other time prior to this appeal: (1) she argues that DOTâ€™s assertion that some of the jurors were struck because of their age was mere pretext because several jurors of the same age were seated on the jury panel; and (2) she argues that one juror struck because of her employment as a â€œthird party collectorâ€ was pretext because â€œ[d]efense counsel did not elaborate on how this occupation would make [the juror] more or less likely to rule for Plaintiff or SCDOT,â€ and also because another person employed in debt collection was seated on the jury.Â  Neither of these arguments, however, was raised to the trial court.Â  When the burden shifted to Maxwell to prove DOTâ€™s reasons were pretext, Maxwellâ€™s sole grounds for objection concerned the validity of DOTâ€™s assessment of the jurorsâ€™ limited education.Â Â  As noted above, Maxwell bore the burden of proving pretext after DOT offered race-neutral explanations for its peremptory strikes.Â  This burden necessarily includes the responsibility to put forward affirmatively and directly every argument to the trial judge for his consideration.Â  As these two specific arguments were never raised to or passed upon by the trial court, we are foreclosed from considering them on appeal.

Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (holding that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-366","title":"State v.
