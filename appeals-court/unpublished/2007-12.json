Pope, of Rock Hill, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nBEATTY,\r\n  J.:Â  Christopher Lee Pride was tried in absentia and without counsel for\r\n  the charges of possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute and\r\n  possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute within the proximity of a\r\n  school.Â  After the jury convicted Pride of both offenses, the circuit court\r\n  judge issued a sealed sentence.Â  Pride appeals, arguing the circuit court judge\r\n  erred in finding he waived his right to counsel.Â  We affirm.\r\nThe panel of this Court affirmed Prideâ€™s convictions\r\n  in a published opinion.Â  State v. Pride, 372 S.C. 443, 641 S.E.2d 921 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  Subsequently, the panel granted Prideâ€™s petition for rehearing and request\r\n  for oral argument.Â  We now withdraw our previous opinion and substitute the\r\n  attached opinion.  \r\nFACTS\r\nAs a result of an on-going narcotics\r\n  investigation, detectives with the Union Police Department identified Pride as\r\n  a crack cocaine dealer.Â  On the morning of April 2, 2003, detectives went to\r\n  Prideâ€™s residence and served him with a search warrant.Â  Upon entering the\r\n  residence, Detective Brian Bailey read Pride his Miranda[1] rights.Â  Bailey then questioned Pride\r\n  as to whether there were any illegal drugs in the house.Â  According to Bailey,\r\n  Pride admitted there were illegal drugs in the house and there was a bag of\r\n  crack cocaine in his blue jeans which were located in his bedroom.Â  While\r\n  conducting a search of the area identified by Pride, the detectives found\r\n  $1,875 in cash and a bag containing 3.62 grams of crack cocaine. Â Detectives then\r\n  placed Pride under arrest and transported him to the police station. Â Pride\r\n  gave a written statement in which he confessed to dealing crack cocaine and\r\n  acknowledged the result of the detectivesâ€™ search of his residence.Â  Subsequently,\r\n  a Union County grand jury indicted Pride for possession of crack cocaine with\r\n  intent to distribute (PWID) and PWID within proximity of a school.\r\nOn October 13, 2004, Prideâ€™s case was\r\n  called for trial.Â  Although Pride was not present, William All, the public\r\n  defender assigned to his case, appeared in court.Â  When the circuit\r\n  court judge inquired about Prideâ€™s absence All outlined the history of his\r\n  representation of Pride.Â  All was initially appointed to represent Pride on two\r\n  other drug charges.Â  After Pride was arrested on a bench warrant, he retained\r\n  Fletcher Smith, a private attorney.Â  All explained that he was again appointed\r\n  to represent Pride on September 13, 2004, the first day of the term of court\r\n  for which Pride was originally scheduled to go to trial.Â  On that day, Pride\r\n  was still represented by Smith.Â  The circuit court judge, however, granted Smithâ€™s\r\n  motion to be relieved and informed Pride that he needed to retain an\r\n  attorney.Â  Because Pride qualified for the public defenderâ€™s office, All was again\r\n  appointed to his case.Â   \r\nPride\r\n  failed to appear for two scheduled appointments with All.Â  Each time, Pride\r\n  informed All that he could not attend the appointments because of his work\r\n  schedule.Â  After the two missed appointments, All sent Pride a letter on\r\n  October 1, 2004, indicating that his trial was scheduled for the week of\r\n  October 11, 2004, and that he could not adequately represent him without\r\n  speaking with him.Â  Additionally, All asked Pride to advise him if he had\r\n  retained private counsel.Â  In response, Pride scheduled another appointment for\r\n  October 7th.Â  Pride again failed to appear for this appointment and offered no\r\n  explanation.Â  Â Â \r\nOn\r\n  October 11th, Pride went to the Union County courthouse to report for roll call\r\n  and was arrested for a driving under suspension charge.Â  When officers searched\r\n  Prideâ€™s person, they discovered $5,000 in his pocket.Â  While in custody, law\r\n  enforcement transported Pride to the courthouse so that he could speak with\r\n  All.Â  At that time, Pride told All that Smith was again representing him and\r\n  that he had sent some money to Smith.Â  Pride also claimed that he had intended\r\n  to give Smith the $5,000 after he reported for roll call.Â  Later that evening,\r\n  Pride was released from custody. Â The next morning at the courthouse, All told\r\n  Pride that Smith needed to come to the courthouse to review the pre-trial\r\n  motions that the solicitor intended to use during his case.Â  According to All,\r\n  Pride indicated that Smith would come to the courthouse.Â  All then contacted\r\n  Smithâ€™s office in the afternoon and discussed the matter with Smithâ€™s\r\n  administrative assistant.Â  The administrative assistant informed All that Pride\r\n  had attempted to pay $250 for Smithâ€™s representation.Â  In response, All stated\r\n  that Pride had indicated to him that he had $5,000 for Smith. Â Although Smithâ€™s\r\n  administrative assistant stated that she would contact Pride about payment and\r\n  then call All back, she did not contact All and there is no evidence in the\r\n  record of an agreement by Smith to represent Pride.Â  On the morning of trial,\r\n  the solicitor contacted All and told him that Smithâ€™s office had informed him\r\n  that Smith did not represent Pride.Â   \r\nUpon\r\n  hearing this factual recitation, the solicitor moved to have Pride tried in his\r\n  absence.Â  The circuit court judge then inquired whether All wished to make a\r\n  motion to be relieved as counsel.Â  Although All was hesitant to make the motion\r\n  out of an ethical obligation to his client, he made the motion which was\r\n  granted by the judge.Â  In so ruling, the judge found that Pride waived his\r\n  right to counsel by his conduct. Â In explaining his ruling, the judge believed\r\n  that Pride was â€œsort of playing the attorney game so to speak and saying\r\n  somebody represents him and they say they donâ€™t.â€Â  Pride was then tried and\r\n  convicted for the drug offenses.Â  After the jury returned a verdict, the judge\r\n  issued a sealed sentence.Â   \r\nOn January 18, 2005, Pride appeared in\r\n  court to be sentenced.Â  Pride admitted that he did not have an attorney for the\r\n  sentencing hearing.Â  All appeared at the hearing and again explained his\r\n  history of representing Pride.Â  He indicated that he could â€œperfect an appeal\r\n  for [Pride] if he wants to raise the issue of whether or not he shouldnâ€™t have\r\n  been tried in his absence.â€Â  All indicated that he would move for appellate\r\n  defense to represent Pride in his appeal.Â  The judge then asked All to stand\r\n  with Pride as he imposed the sentence.Â  The judge sentenced Pride to\r\n  twenty-five years imprisonment and a $50,000 fine for PWID and fifteen years imprisonment\r\n  and a $10,000 fine for PWID within proximity of a school.Â  The sentences were\r\n  to be served concurrently.Â  This appeal followed.Â  Â Â \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPride\r\n  argues the circuit court judge erred in relieving All as his counsel and\r\n  proceeding with the trial in his absence.Â  He contends his conduct was not\r\n  sufficient to establish that he waived his right to counsel.[2]\r\nAs a\r\n  threshold matter, we initially question whether Pride adequately preserved this\r\n  issue for our review.Â  Although Prideâ€™s lack of trial representation was\r\n  discussed at his sentencing hearing, Pride never moved for a new trial on the\r\n  ground that he did not knowingly waive his right to counsel.Â  See State\r\n    v. Williams, 303 S.C. 410, 411, 401 S.E.2d 168, 169 (1991)(holding\r\n  defendant, who was tried and convicted in his absence without counsel, failed\r\n  to preserve issue of whether he waived his right to trial counsel where neither\r\n  he nor his sentencing attorney raised this issue to the circuit court); cf. State v. White, 305 S.C. 455, 456, 409 S.E.2d 397, 397 (1991) (finding\r\n  defendant, who was tried and convicted in his absence without counsel and\r\n  appeared pro se at the sentencing hearing, could raise the issue\r\n  of whether he waived his right to trial counsel because defendantâ€™s first\r\n  opportunity to raise the issue was on appeal).Â Â  Â Â Â \r\nAssuming\r\n  the general discussion during the sentencing hearing was sufficient to preserve\r\n  this issue, we find the circuit court judge correctly found Pride waived his\r\n  right to counsel by his conduct. Â Â Â \r\nâ€œThe\r\n  Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants a right to counsel.Â  This right\r\n  may be waived.â€ State v. Gill, 355 S.C. 234, 243, 584 S.E.2d 432, 437\r\n  (Ct. App. 2003)(citations omitted).Â  This court has explained that â€œ[a]\r\n  defendant may surrender his right to counsel through (1) waiver by affirmative,\r\n  verbal request; (2) waiver by conduct; and (3) forfeiture.â€Â  State v. Thompson,\r\n  355 S.C. 255, 262, 584 S.E.2d 131, 134 (Ct. App. 2003).Â   \r\nIn support of his argument, Pride appropriately relies on our\r\n  decision in State v. Thompson, 355 S.C. 255, 584 S.E.2d 131 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  However, as will be more fully discussed, neither Thompson nor our\r\n  more recent case of State v. Roberson, 371 S.C. 334, 638 S.E.2d 93 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2006), cert. granted (Oct. 19, 2007), require reversal of Prideâ€™s\r\n  convictions and sentences.  \r\nIn Thompson, the defendant was tried in absentia and\r\n  without counsel for the offenses of discharging a firearm into a dwelling and\r\n  malicious injury to personal property over $1,000 but less than $5,000.Â  After\r\n  the jury convicted Thompson, the judge issued a sealed sentence.Â  At\r\n  sentencing, Thompsonâ€™s counsel moved for a new trial because he was denied the\r\n  right to counsel.Â  Counsel claimed that Thompson had appeared at four or five\r\n  roll calls after his arrest.Â  Additionally, counsel alleged that Thompson,\r\n  despite his request, had been turned down for a public defender because he did\r\n  not meet the financial requirements to qualify.Â  In terms of Thompsonâ€™s failure\r\n  to appear at trial, his counsel informed the court that Thompson was not given\r\n  adequate notice of the trial date.Â  Thompson, 355 S.C. at 260, 584\r\n  S.E.2d at 133.Â  The court denied Thompsonâ€™s motion for a new trial.Â  Id. at 260, 584 S.E.2d at 134.Â  On appeal, this court reversed the decision of the\r\n  circuit court.Â  We held that Thompsonâ€™s failure to appear at trial did not rise\r\n  to the level of waiver.Â  Id. at 266, 584 S.E.2d at 136.Â  Our decision\r\n  was based on the following factors:Â  (1) Thompson had not been advised of the\r\n  dangers and disadvantages of self-representation under Faretta; (2)\r\n  there was no inference in the record that Thompson understood the dangers and\r\n  disadvantages of self-representation; and (3) Thompson did not have a prior\r\n  record which would have familiarized him with the criminal court system.Â  Id. at 267, 584 S.E.2d at 137.\r\nRecently,\r\n  this court had the opportunity to apply Thompson in reaching its\r\n  decision in State v. Roberson, 371 S.C. 334, 638 S.E.2d 93 (Ct. App.\r\n  2006), cert. granted (Oct. 19, 2007).Â  In Roberson, the defendant\r\n  was arrested and then released on bond for failing to register as a sex\r\n  offender.Â  The terms of the bond required the defendant to appear for roll call\r\n  at the term of general sessions court in Dorchester County beginning on\r\n  November 29, 1999.Â  By signing the bond, the defendant acknowledged that he\r\n  would be tried in his absence if he failed to appear in court.Â  The Dorchester\r\n  County Solicitorâ€™s office mailed to the defendantâ€™s last known address two\r\n  notices of appearances for the terms of court scheduled for November 29, 1999,\r\n  and January 10, 2000.Â  On February 16, 2000, the defendant was tried in his absence\r\n  without counsel.Â  After the jury convicted the defendant, the circuit court\r\n  judge issued a sealed sentence.Â   \r\nApproximately\r\n  three years later, the defendant, who was represented by counsel, appeared\r\n  before the circuit court to be sentenced.Â  During this hearing, the defendantâ€™s\r\n  counsel moved for a new trial on the grounds the defendant did not knowingly\r\n  and voluntarily fail to appear for his trial and he was denied his right to be\r\n  represented by counsel at trial.Â  Because it was unclear whether the defendant\r\n  had been represented at trial, the judge continued the motion until a trial\r\n  transcript could be located.Â  At the final hearing, the defendantâ€™s counsel\r\n  moved to vacate the defendantâ€™s conviction and sentence primarily on the ground\r\n  that he was not represented by counsel at trial.Â  In response, the solicitor\r\n  asserted the defendant waived his right to counsel by failing to appear and\r\n  that he was apprised of his right to counsel at the bond hearing.Â  The judge\r\n  denied the motion for a new trial finding the defendant waived his right to\r\n  counsel because the terms of his bond indicated that he would be tried in his\r\n  absence if he failed to appear and he had been informed of his right to counsel\r\n  at the bond hearing.Â  Roberson, 371 S.C. at 337, 638 S.E.2d at 94.\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, we reversed the circuit court judgeâ€™s decision and remanded for a new\r\n  trial.Â  Roberson, 371 S.C. at 339, 638 S.E.2d at 96.Â  Applying Thompson,\r\n  we found the defendantâ€™s failure to appear at trial did not constitute an\r\n  affirmative waiver of his right to counsel.Â  Moreover, because the defendant\r\n  was never advised of proceeding without representation, we declined to infer\r\n  that the defendantâ€™s conduct, i.e., his failure to appear at trial,\r\n  constituted a waiver of his right to counsel.Â  Id. at 339, 638 S.E.2d at\r\n  95.\r\nAlthough\r\n  a cursory reading of above-outlined cases would appear to warrant a reversal of\r\n  Prideâ€™s convictions and sentences, upon closer review we find a crucial\r\n  difference between the facts in Prideâ€™s case and those of Thompson and Roberson.Â \r\n  Significantly, unlike Pride, the defendants in Thompson and Roberson were not represented by counsel until the sentencing hearing.Â Â  Thus, the\r\n  finding that the defendants in Thompson and Roberson waived their\r\n  right to trial counsel was based solely on their failure to appear for trial.Â \r\n  Here, Pride not only failed to appear for trial but he also failed to cooperate\r\n  with his appointed counsel and knowingly attempted to manipulate the court\r\n  system.Â  Pride was represented by appointed counsel and given additional time\r\n  to prepare for trial after his private attorney was relieved.Â  Pride repeatedly\r\n  failed to appear for his scheduled appointments with the public defender or\r\n  offer any assistance in preparation for his defense.Â  Pride essentially â€œfiredâ€\r\n  his appointed attorney by assuring him up to the day before trial that Smith\r\n  was representing him and he had sent Smith money to retain him as counsel.Â \r\n  Pride, however, was aware that Smith had not agreed to represent him.Â  Despite\r\n  this knowledge and his awareness of the trial date, Pride failed to cooperate\r\n  with his appointed counsel and failed to retain a private attorney by the date\r\n  of the scheduled trial. Â Furthermore, there is evidence in the record that\r\n  someone had seen Pride in the courthouse shortly before the case was called for\r\n  trial. Â Yet, Pride refused to show up for trial apparently because he was\r\n  represented by appointed counsel rather than counsel of his own choosing. Â Based\r\n  on the foregoing, we find Prideâ€™s deliberate, dilatory, and manipulative\r\n  conduct was sufficient to waive his right to counsel.Â   \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  we reject Prideâ€™s contention that his convictions should be reversed because\r\n  the trial judge failed to admonish him regarding the dangers and disadvantages of\r\n  self-representation pursuant to Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806\r\n  (1975).Â  In Faretta, the United States Supreme Court ruled that a\r\n  defendant in a state criminal trial has a constitutional right to proceed\r\n  without counsel when he voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so.Â  Faretta,\r\n  422 U.S. at 835.Â  Faretta, however, is inapposite to the facts of the\r\n  instant case.Â  At no point did Pride indicate that he wanted to represent\r\n  himself.Â  Instead, he consistently communicated to the court and his\r\n  court-appointed attorney that he wanted to retain a private attorney.Â  See,\r\n    e.g., Robards v. Rees, 789 F.2d 379, 383 (6th Cir. 1986) (noting\r\n  exception to application of Faretta where â€œprosecution makes an\r\n  affirmative showing that the defendantâ€™s request for self-representation is\r\n  merely a tactic to secure a delay in the proceedingâ€); State v. Jones,\r\n  546 P.2d 45, 51 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1976) (finding Faretta was not\r\n  controlling where defendant did not request that he be permitted to represent\r\n  himself but, instead, requested on the day of trial that his present attorney\r\n  be fired and that a new one be appointed); State v. Shumaker, 914 So. 2d\r\n  1156, 1162 (La. Ct. App. 2005) (holding defendantâ€™s reliance on Faretta,\r\n  was misplaced and stating â€œdefendant never expressly asked that he be allowed\r\n  self-representation.Â  He simply indicated that he wanted to fire his counsel.Â \r\n  That statement certainly does not reach a clear and unequivocal expression\r\n  requesting the right to represent oneself as required by Faretta.â€).\r\nWe find\r\n  support for our decision in a recent case issued by the Indiana Supreme Court.Â  Jackson v. State, 868 N.E.2d 494 (Ind. 2007).Â  In Jackson, the defendant was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to\r\n  deliver and possession of a handgun without a license.Â  An attorney admitted in\r\n  Indiana filed Jacksonâ€™s preliminary motions.Â  At subsequent hearings, the\r\n  defendant appeared with counsel who was admitted to the state pro hac vice.Â  At\r\n  a final pre-trial conference, the defendant appeared without an attorney.Â \r\n  Because the defense had not complied with the Stateâ€™s pre-trial discovery\r\n  requests, the trial judge revoked Jacksonâ€™s attorneyâ€™s pro hac vice status.Â \r\n  The initial Indiana attorney remained Jacksonâ€™s attorney of record.Â \r\n  Approximately one week before trial, Jackson and his attorney appeared for a\r\n  hearing and informed the trial judge that Jackson intended to retain new\r\n  counsel.Â  Based on this information, the trial judge granted Jacksonâ€™s motion\r\n  to continue his trial for several months.Â  Neither Jackson nor any defense\r\n  attorney appeared for two pretrial conferences.Â  After a bench warrant was\r\n  issued for Jacksonâ€™s arrest, the State moved to proceed with the trial in Jacksonâ€™s absence.Â  Ultimately, Jackson was tried and convicted in absentia and without\r\n  counsel.Â  On appeal, the Indiana Court of Appeals reversed Jacksonâ€™s\r\n  convictions and remanded for a new trial.Â  The Indiana Supreme Court affirmed\r\n  the trial judge, stating:\r\n\r\n\tOf course, the constitutional rights of Jackson and every other\r\n  accused must be strictly enforced.Â  But a defendant cannot be permitted to\r\n  manipulate the system simply by refusing to show up for trial.Â  Jackson has not established on this record that any of his constitutional rights have been\r\n  violated.Â  To the contrary, we conclude that this record fully supports the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s finding that Jackson willfully and knowingly refused to appear at\r\n  trial and waived his right to counsel and his right to be present at trial.Â  We\r\n  also conclude that, under these circumstances, the trial court did not have a\r\n  duty to readvise Jackson of the right to counsel or the perils of\r\n  self-representation when it revoked Jacksonâ€™s attorneyâ€™s pro hac vice status\r\n  because there was no indication that Jackson intended to proceed pro se or\r\n  could not hire another attorney.\r\n\r\nId. at 497-98.Â  The Court concluded by\r\n  stating, â€œ[w]e cannot expect a trial court to hunt down a defendant to admonish\r\n  him about the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation if the defendant\r\n  has made no indication to the trial court that he intends to proceed pro se and\r\n  then subsequently does not show up for trial.â€Â  Id. at 501.\r\nWe believe our decision is also consistent with case law in this state\r\n  where our appellate courts have found a defendantâ€™s conduct constituted a\r\n  waiver of his right to counsel.Â  See State v. Cain, 277 S.C. 210,\r\n  210-11, 284 S.E.2d 779, 779 (1981) (inferring waiver of counsel and affirming\r\n  defendantâ€™s conviction and sentence where defendant, who was tried in absentia\r\n  and without counsel for third-offense driving under the influence, failed to\r\n  fulfill the conditions of his appearance bond and neglected to keep in contact\r\n  with his attorney despite knowing the trial was imminent); see also State v. Jacobs, 271 S.C. 126, 126-28, 245 S.E.2d 606, 607-08 (1978)\r\n  (inferring defendant waived his right to counsel where:Â  (1) trial court\r\n  allowed defendant, a non-indigent, reasonable time to retain counsel; (2) trial\r\n  court urged defendant on several occasions to retain counsel and provided\r\n  defendant access to a telephone and additional time to make the arrangements;\r\n  (3) defendant on the day of trial did not name his attorney; and (4) defendant\r\n  failed to make a sufficient showing of reasons for his failure to have counsel\r\n  present at trial); State v. Gill, 355 S.C. 234, 245, 584 S.E.2d 432,\r\n  437-38 (Ct. App. 2003) (inferring defendant waived his right to counsel where\r\n  defendant failed to retain counsel for trial despite his repeated assurances to\r\n  the court that he intended to hire private counsel and did not require the\r\n  appointment of a public defender). [3]  \r\nPride attempts to distinguish the above-referenced cases on the\r\n  basis that the defendants in those cases were non-indigent.Â  We find this\r\n  distinction to be unavailing.Â  Similar to the non-indigent defendants, Pride\r\n  attempted to â€œplay the systemâ€ in:Â  (1) refusing to retain counsel by the\r\n  scheduled trial date; (2) giving repeated assurances to his court-appointed\r\n  counsel and the prosecution up until the day of trial that he had retained a\r\n  private attorney; and (3) failing to cooperate with his court-appointed counsel.Â \r\n  The fact that Pride may not have had the financial means to hire counsel has no\r\n  bearing on our determination that Prideâ€™s conduct was sufficient to constitute\r\n  a waiver of the right to counsel. Â Â Pride was appointed counsel, but\r\n  voluntarily chose not to utilize assigned counsel despite his knowledge that he\r\n  had not retained another attorney.Â  Cf. State v. Clay, 11 S.W.3d\r\n  706, 713 (Mo. Ct. App. 1999) (holding indigent defendant tried in absentia and\r\n  without counsel impliedly waived his right to counsel and, therefore, the\r\n  statutory requirement for a written waiver of right to counsel was not required).\r\nWe emphasize that our decision is limited to the specific facts of\r\n  this case.Â  Here, the constitutional mandates regarding a defendantâ€™s right to the\r\n  assistance of counsel were satisfied in that Pride was in fact appointed\r\n  counsel.Â  Pride, however, willingly chose to disregard this appointment in an\r\n  attempt to procure counsel of his own choosing up until the day of trial.Â  Because\r\n  we cannot overturn our stateâ€™s prior precedent that a waiver of a right to\r\n  counsel may be inferred by a defendantâ€™s conduct, we reluctantly hold Prideâ€™s\r\n  conduct was sufficient to try him in absentia and without counsel.\r\nDespite our holding, we take this opportunity to express our displeasure\r\n  with the policy of permitting a defendant to be tried in absentia and without\r\n  counsel.[4]Â \r\n  Because the right to counsel is such a fundamental right, we believe the more\r\n  prudent policy would be for a trial judge to decline to relieve counsel immediately\r\n  prior to trial if a defendant is being tried in absentia.\r\nAccordingly, Prideâ€™s convictions and sentences are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, J., concurs.\r\nANDERSON, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nANDERSON, J., dissenting\r\n  in a separate opinion\r\nThe majority concludes that Prideâ€™s conduct was\r\n  sufficient to waive his right to counsel.Â  I DISAGREE and VOTE to REVERSE AND REMAND.Â Â  \r\n \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nPride was indicted\r\n  for possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute (PWID) and PWID\r\n  within proximity of a school.Â  When his case was called for trial on October\r\n  13, 2004, Pride was absent.Â   \r\nFletcher Smith, a\r\n  private attorney, represented Pride on September 13, 2004, the first day of the\r\n  term of court in which Prideâ€™s case was originally scheduled for trial.Â  Smith\r\n  moved to be relieved and the trial judge granted his motion.Â  Pride qualified\r\n  for representation by the public defender, and William All was appointed.\r\n \r\nOn October 11,\r\n  2004, Pride reported for roll call at the Union County courthouse, where he was\r\n  arrested on another charge.Â  At that time he informed All that Smith would\r\n  again represent him.Â  Pride allegedly intended to deliver $5000 to Smith after\r\n  roll call.Â   \r\nPride was released\r\n  from custody later that evening. Â The next day All advised Pride that Smith\r\n  needed to review the pre-trial motions the solicitor intended to make.Â  Pride\r\n  told All that Smith would, in fact, appear at the courthouse.Â  Later All\r\n  learned from Smithâ€™s office that Pride had attempted to retain Smith but had\r\n  not tendered the full $5000 payment.Â  On the morning of trial, All discovered\r\n  through the solicitorâ€™s office that Smith did not represent Pride.\r\nThe solicitor moved\r\n  to try Pride in his absence.Â  The trial judge asked All if he would like to\r\n  move to be relieved as counsel.Â  All hesitated because of his ethical\r\n  obligation to Pride, but he eventually made the motion for relief.Â  The trial\r\n  judge found Pride waived his right to counsel by his conduct and granted Allâ€™s\r\n  motion.Â  The trial proceeded in Prideâ€™s absence, without counsel, and the jury\r\n  convicted Pride of both charges.Â Â Â Â   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPride contends the\r\n  trial judge erred in concluding he waived his Sixth Amendment right to counsel\r\n  by his conduct.Â  I agree.  \r\n&nbsp;â€œThe Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of our\r\n  Constitution guarantee that a person brought to trial in any state or federal\r\n  court must be afforded the right to the assistance of counsel before he can be\r\n  validly convicted and punished by imprisonment.â€Â  Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 807 (1975).Â  â€œOf all the rights that an accused person has,\r\n  the right to be represented by counsel is by far the most pervasive for it\r\n  affects his ability to assert any other rights he may have.â€Â  United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 654 (1984).Â  The courts indulge every\r\n  reasonable presumption against waiver of fundamental constitutional rights and\r\n  do not presume acquiescence in the loss of fundamental rights.Â  Johnson v.\r\n    Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464 (1938).Â   \r\nA criminal\r\n  defendant may waive his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.Â  See e.g., State\r\n    v. Thompson 355 S.C. 255, 262, 584 S.E.2d 131, 134 (Ct. App. 2003); State\r\n      v. Boykin, 324 S.C. 552, 556, 478 S.E.2d 689, 690 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  A\r\n  waiver is an intentional and voluntary relinquishment of a known right.Â  Thompson 355 S.C. at 262, 584 S.E.2d at 134 (citing United States v. Goldberg, 67\r\n  F.3d 1092, 1099 (3d Cir. 1995)).Â  The waiver of the right to counsel must be\r\n  the product of a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent decision.Â  State v.\r\n    Cabrera-Pena, 350 S.C. 517, 535, 567 S.E.2d 472, 482 (Ct. App. 2002).Â \r\n  â€œWhen an accused manages his own defense, he relinquishes, as a purely factual\r\n  matter, many of the traditional benefits associated with the right to counsel.Â \r\n  For this reason, in order to represent himself, the accused must â€˜knowingly and\r\n  intelligentlyâ€™ forgo those relinquished benefits.â€Â  State v. McLauren,\r\n  349 S.C. 488, 493, 563 S.E.2d 346, 348 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting Faretta,\r\n  422 U.S. at 835).Â   \r\n\r\n\tAlthough\r\n  a defendant need not himself have the skill and experience of a lawyer in order\r\n  competently and intelligently to choose self-representation, he should be\r\n    made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so that the\r\n    record will establish that â€˜he knows what he is doing and his choice is made\r\n    with eyes open.â€™ \r\n\r\nId. (citing Adams v. U.S. ex rel. McCann, 317 U.S. 269, 279 (1942))Â  (emphasis supplied).Â  In order to effectuate a valid waiver of the\r\n  right to counsel, the two-pronged Faretta test must be met in which the\r\n  defendant is (1) advised of his right to counsel and (2) adequately warned of\r\n  the dangers of self-representation.Â  Thompson 355 S.C. at 262, 584\r\n  S.E.2d at 134 (citing Prince v. State, 301 S.C. 422, 423-24, 392 S.E.2d\r\n  462, 463 (1990)).\r\nAlthough waiver is\r\n  most commonly understood as an affirmative verbal request, the intentional and\r\n  voluntary relinquishment of the right to counsel may be inferred from a\r\n  defendantâ€™s conduct.Â  SeeÂ  United States v. Goldberg, 67 F.3d\r\n  1092, 1099 (3d Cir.1995);Â  State v. Roberson, 371 S.C. 334, 339, 638\r\n  S.E.2d 93, 95 (Ct. App. 2006); Thompson, 355 S.C. at 262, 584 S.E.2d at\r\n  134; State v. Gill, 355 S.C. 234, 245, 584 S.E.2d 432, 438 (Ct. App.\r\n  2003); State v. Boykin, 324 S.C. 552, 556, 478 S.E.2d 689, 690 (Ct. App.\r\n  1996).Â Â Â   \r\nA defendantâ€™s failure\r\n  to appear at trial, however, is not, by itself, sufficient to sustain the\r\n  inference that he intentionally and voluntarily relinquished his right to\r\n  counsel.Â  See State v. Roberson, 371 S.C. 334, 339, 638\r\n  S.E.2d 93, 95 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Most courts have held the defendant must first\r\n  be warned about conduct that may subsequently be treated as a waiver of\r\n  counsel.Â  Boykin, 324 S.C. at 556, 478 S.E.2d at 691.Â  Moreover, â€œto the\r\n  extent that the defendantâ€™s [conduct is] examined under the doctrine of\r\n  â€˜waiver,â€™ there can be no valid waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel\r\n  unless the defendant also receives Faretta warnings.â€Â  Goldberg,\r\n  67 F.3d at 1100 (citing United States v. Bauer, 956 F.2d 693 (7th Cir.\r\n  1992; United States v. Allen, 895 F.2d 1577 (10th Cir. 1990)).Â   \r\nâ€œThe determination\r\n  of whether there has been an intelligent waiver of right to counsel must\r\n  depend, in each case, upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding\r\n  that case, including the background, experience, and conduct of the accused.â€Â  Reed\r\n    v. Ozmint, 374 S.C. 19, 28, 647 S.E.2d 209, 214 (2007) (quoting Zerbst,\r\n  304 U.S. at 464).Â  The trial judge is responsible for ensuring that the accused\r\n  is informed of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation and makes a\r\n  knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel.Â  State v. Brewer,\r\n  328 S.C. 117, 119, 492 S.E.2d 97, 98 (1997); Cabrera-Pena, 350 S.C. at\r\n  531, 567 S.E.2d at 480-81.\r\nIn the absence of\r\n  specific inquiry on the dangers of proceeding without counsel, the requirements\r\n  of a voluntary waiver will be satisfied if the record demonstrates the\r\n  defendantâ€™s decision to waive counsel was made with an understanding of the\r\n  risks of self-representation.Â  Watts v. State, 347 S.C. 399, 402,\r\n  556 S.E.2d 368, 370 (2001).Â  However, where the record fails to demonstrate the\r\n  defendant made an informed choice to proceed pro se, with â€œeyes open,â€ then a\r\n  knowing and voluntary waiver of counsel is not effectuated and the case should\r\n  be remanded for a new trial.Â  Id. at 402-03, 556 S.E.2s at 370.\r\nIn Thompson and Roberson, this court declined to infer the defendantsâ€™ conduct\r\n  constituted waiver of counsel because the court had not advised either\r\n  defendant of the dangers of proceeding without representation. 355 S.C. 255,\r\n  584 S.E.2d 131; 371 S.C. 334, 638 S.E.2d 93.Â  In Thompson, the defendant\r\n  failed to appear for trial, although he appeared for roll call a number of\r\n  times after his arrest.Â  355 S.C. at 260, 584 S.E.2d at 133.Â  He was tried in\r\n  his absence, without counsel.Â  At sentencing, Thompson moved for a new trial\r\n  because he was denied the right to counsel.Â  Thompson had not qualified\r\n  financially for representation by the public defender, but he averred\r\n  extenuating circumstances prevented his retaining private counsel.Â  In\r\n  addition, he alleged inadequate notice of the trial date.Â  We reversed the\r\n  trial judgeâ€™s denial of Thompsonâ€™s motion, finding his failure to appear was\r\n  insufficient to infer a valid waiver of his right to counsel.Â  Id. at 260, 584 S.E.2d at 134.Â  We premised our conclusion on the fact that Thompson\r\n  had not been advised, under Faretta, of the dangers of proceeding\r\n  without representation of counsel.Â  Moreover, the evidentiary record did not\r\n  indicate that Thompson understood the dangers of self-representation.  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Similarly, the\r\n  defendant in Roberson was tried in his absence, without counsel, and\r\n  convicted.Â  371 S.C. at 336, 638 S.E.2d at 94.Â  At sentencing he moved for a\r\n  new trial on grounds he did not knowingly and voluntarily fail to appear for\r\n  trial and he was denied his right to counsel.Â  Id.Â  The sentencing judge\r\n  denied Robersonâ€™s motion for new trial on the ground he was deprived of\r\n  representation of counsel.Â  Id. at 337, 638 S.E.2d at 94.Â  We reversed\r\n  and remanded for a new trial.Â  Because Roberson was not warned of the dangers\r\n  of proceeding without counsel, the inference that his failure to appear\r\n  constituted the intentional and voluntary relinquishment of his right to\r\n  counsel was inappropriate.Â  Id. at 340, 638 S.E.2d at 96.Â   \r\nThe majority\r\n  attempts to distinguish Thompson and Roberson from the case at\r\n  bar, noting Thompson and Roberson were â€œpro seâ€ defendants, while Pride was\r\n  represented by appointed counsel.Â  The gist and gravamen of my dissonance with\r\n  the majority is that Pride became a â€œpro seâ€ in his absence without any notice\r\n  whatsoever when the trial judge relieved Prideâ€™s appointed counsel immediately\r\n  before trial.Â  The trial judge prompted Prideâ€™s attorney to make a motion to be\r\n  relieved as counsel.Â  The attorney had obvious concernment in regard to his ethical\r\n  obligations to Pride and voiced that position with some degree of certitude:Â \r\n \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tCourt: \r\n\t\t\tAll Right . . . Mr. All,&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\twhere do you stand.&nbsp; Do you wish to be, do you feel, I feel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tthat by his conduct you certainly have a right to move to be \r\n\t\t\trelieved because he has not cooperated with you in any way \r\n\t\t\twhatsoever and as has happened in other cases it appears that heâ€™s \r\n\t\t\tsort of playing the attorney game so to speak and saying somebody \r\n\t\t\trepresents him and they say they donâ€™t; in any event, I certainly \r\n\t\t\tfeel very comfortable making a&nbsp;&nbsp; finding heâ€™s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\twaived his right to counsel by his conduct and I am certainly not \r\n\t\t\tgoing to put you in a position of sitting there trying a case \r\n\t\t\tunprepared, particularly trying a case in someoneâ€™s absence when you \r\n\t\t\tare, have not had adequate conversation with your client due to his \r\n\t\t\tconduct.&nbsp; So do you wish to, I know thatâ€™s an awful position \r\n\t\t\tfor you to be in, but.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tAll: \r\n\t\t\tThat is an awful position, Your \r\n\t\t\tHonor.&nbsp; I was sitting here trying, sitting here the last 30 \r\n\t\t\tminutes running through my mind what to ask the Court because I feel \r\n\t\t\tan obligation in some manner to Mr. Pride even though heâ€™s failed to \r\n\t\t\tfulfill anything in regards to the assistance and cooperation with \r\n\t\t\tour office, Your Honor. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tCourt: \r\n\t\t\tWell, let me interject and put \r\n\t\t\tthis in your thinking.&nbsp; He has pretty much indicated he doesnâ€™t \r\n\t\t\twant you to represent him because heâ€™s continued to say that he has \r\n\t\t\tretained and either gone by their office and tried to pay another \r\n\t\t\tlawyer yesterday, so I think you may need to factor in the fact that \r\n\t\t\tif you sort of, I hate to say this kind of language in court but you \r\n\t\t\tare sort of damned if you do and damned if you donâ€™t because if you \r\n\t\t\tgo forward then heâ€™ll be saying he was represented by an attorney he \r\n\t\t\tdidnâ€™t want.&nbsp; If you donâ€™t go forward heâ€™s going to say he \r\n\t\t\tdidnâ€™t have an attorney at all. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tAll:\r\n\t\t\tWell, Your Honor, I do make a \r\n\t\t\tmotion to be relieved as counsel.&nbsp; Your Honor, I would ask that \r\n\t\t\tbefore the Court starts the case with Mr. Pride that they have the \r\n\t\t\tSheriff or the Bailiff or someone call his name.&nbsp; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tCourt:\r\n\t\t\tWeâ€™ll do that.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tAll:\r\n\t\t\tI will be staying basically on \r\n\t\t\tstand by in case they find Mr. Pride and once they find him if he \r\n\t\t\tindicates that he wants an attorney, if the Court feels fit to \r\n\t\t\tappoint one, I will be here.&nbsp; Iâ€™m not going to disappear. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tCourt:\r\n\t\t\tAll right.&nbsp; Well, Iâ€™m going \r\n\t\t\tto relieve you of counsel.&nbsp; I think it would be egregious for \r\n\t\t\tthe Court to require someone in this context who not only has not, \r\n\t\t\twho has made a valiant attempt to get prepared and by his clientâ€™s \r\n\t\t\tconduct been unable to do what he needs to do to be ready for trial \r\n\t\t\tand to put you in that spot would certainly not be fair.&nbsp; And \r\n\t\t\titâ€™s his conduct that has created the, he has sort of hoisted on his \r\n\t\t\town petard, he is a victim of his own conduct. . . .\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe ruling of the\r\n  trial judge judicially converted Pride from a represented defendant to a pro se\r\n  defendant.Â  Irrefutably, the evidentiary record reveals that Pride desired\r\n  representation by counsel.Â  Any ambivalence or equivocation by Pride related to\r\n  the identity of his attorney, i.e. a hired attorney or the public defender.Â \r\n  Pride never indicated directly or indirectly that he desired to proceed pro\r\n  se.Â   \r\nFactually and\r\n  legally the deprivation of an important constitutional right at this stage of\r\n  the trial is troublesome and is infected with expository difficulty.Â  The\r\n  judicial imprimatur and approbation placed by the majority upon the denial of\r\n  this basic constitutional right at this temporal point in the trial is an\r\n  improper circumspection of a defendantâ€™s right to counsel as guaranteed by the South Carolina and United States Constitutions.\r\n \r\nI hold the rule of\r\n  law we applied in Thompson and Roberson is equally applicable\r\n  here.Â  Under Faretta and its progeny, a defendant must be apprised of\r\n  his right to representation and cautioned about the dangers of proceeding\r\n  without representation before being convicted and imprisoned.Â  A valid waiver\r\n  of counsel, either by affirmative, verbal request or by conduct, requires\r\n  compliance with Faretta.Â  In re Christopher H., 359 S.C. 161,\r\n  166-67, 596 S.E.2d 500, 503 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The evidentiary record here is\r\n  devoid of any indication the trial judge apprised Pride of his right to\r\n  counsel, warned him of the dangers of proceeding without representation,\r\n  determined he understood the dangers of self-representation, or cautioned him\r\n  that his conduct may be treated as a waiver of counsel.Â   \r\nAccordingly, I VOTE to REVERSE and REMAND for new trial. \r\n \r\n\r\n[1] Â Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r\n[2]Â Â  Although Pride was tried in his absence and without\r\n  counsel, we believe Pride only challenges the waiver of his right to counsel.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we confine our analysis to this limited issue.Â   \r\n[3]Â Â  Interestingly, the Indiana Supreme Court referenced Cain and Gill in its decision.Â  The Court, however, found that\r\n  Jacksonâ€™s case was different in that â€œ[n]one of the cases involved a defendant\r\n  who appeared with a lawyer but then disappeared for trial, a clear finding by\r\n  the trial court that the defendant willfully and voluntarily missed his own\r\n  trial, and no suggestion that the defendant would not hire his own attorney.â€ Jackson, 868 N.E.2d at 500-01.Â  We agree with this assessment and also find that\r\n  Prideâ€™s willful conduct surpassed the conduct in our stateâ€™s cases which was\r\n  sufficient to constitute an implied waiver of the right to counsel.\r\n[4]Â Â  We note that our research reveals very few\r\n  published decisions where a trial court permits a defendant to be tried in\r\n  absentia and without counsel.Â  Significantly, the majority of the cases which\r\n  present this factual scenario arise out of proceedings in this stateâ€™s trial\r\n  courts.Â  See State v. White, 305 S.C. 455, 409 S.E.2d 397 (1991); State v. Williams, 303 S.C. 410, 401 S.E.2d 168 (1991); State v. Cain,\r\n  277 S.C. 210, 284 S.E.2d 779 (1981); State v.

Ct. 1998).Â  In light of the limited case law, we question whether\r\n  our Supreme Court should, if given the appropriate factual circumstances,\r\n  reconsider the policy apparently adopted at the trial court level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-545","title":"State v.

Harris filed this action against Penn Warranty Corporation (Penn) and\r\n  West Main Automotive (West Main) arising out of Harrisâ€™ purchase of an\r\n  automobile.Â  At a jury trial, the court granted a directed verdict for the\r\n  defendants as to five causes of action and the parties then reached a\r\n  settlement.Â  The court recorded the settlement on the record and dismissed the remaining\r\n  causes of action.Â  Harris appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHarris purchased a used automobile from\r\n  West Main and a warranty from Penn.Â  The warranty included a clause\r\n  invalidating the warranty if the odometer was inoperable.Â  Several months\r\n  later, Harris returned the vehicle for repairs.Â  Penn refused to honor the\r\n  warranty as the odometer was inoperable and refunded the payment for the\r\n  warranty.Â  \r\nAt trial, after Harrisâ€™ presentation of his case, the court\r\n  directed a verdict as to five of the ten causes of action and held the issue of\r\n  directed verdicts on the remaining causes of action under consideration.Â  The\r\n  court recessed and the parties negotiated a settlement.Â  When court reconvened,\r\n  the parties discussed the settlement on the record and all parties agreed to\r\n  the settlement of â€œall issues involved in this case.â€Â  Â Â Â \r\nThe court issued an order stating:Â  â€œRegarding\r\n  Causes of Action #[ ] 2,7,8,9 and 10 of Plaintiffâ€™s Complaint the Court\r\n  Directed a Verdict for Defense.Â  As to all other issues, the parties have\r\n  settled the balance [of the] action thereby disposing [of] the entire case.â€Â  Harris\r\n  did not file any post-trial motions.Â  Harris filed a notice of appeal and\r\n  refused to accept the settlement funds.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIn his appeal, Harris\r\n  summarily argues his attorney â€œfailed to disclose to the court . . . the\r\n  evidence of documents, deposition, exhibits, complaints and transcripts . . .\r\n  .â€Â  We find no ground for reversal of the trial courtâ€™s order.Â  \r\nâ€œIt is a\r\n  long-standing and well-settled rule that an attorney may settle litigation on\r\n  behalf of his client and that the client is bound by his attorneyâ€™s settlement\r\n  actions.â€Â  Motley v.

Â Doe later positively\r\n  identified Clark in a photo line up. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nClark was\r\n  employed by Mitchell Contract Interiors (Mitchell) and worked as an electrician\r\n  in the building where Doe worked.Â  Doe filed a suit against Mitchell alleging\r\n  it had been negligent in hiring Clark.Â  As a result of the alleged attack, Clark was indicted for kidnapping and assault with intent to commit criminal sexual\r\n  conduct.Â  Clarkâ€™s jury trial was held February 14 - 15, 2006.Â  \r\nDuring Clarkâ€™s trial, Clarkâ€™s attorney questioned Doe about the\r\n  civil suit she had filed in an attempt to show a possible motive to lie.Â  Â During\r\n  his cross examination of Doe, Clarkâ€™s attorney asked: â€œIsnâ€™t it true that\r\n  approximately November 2004 you sued the company who Mr. Clark worked for?â€Â \r\n  Doe replied: â€œI am suing because the company hired someone with a criminal\r\n  background and that person attacked me.â€Â  Clarkâ€™s attorney immediately asked\r\n  for a bench conference and moved for a mistrial.Â  The judge denied the motion\r\n  for a mistrial but gave a curative instruction.\r\nThe\r\n  jury found Clark guilty on both charged crimes.Â  Clark now appeals the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s refusal to grant a mistrial due to evidence of his prior criminal\r\n  background being introduced during his trial.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFollowing\r\n  the judgeâ€™s curative instruction, Clarkâ€™s attorney failed to object to the\r\n  sufficiency of the curative instruction or move for a mistrial.Â  Therefore, the\r\n  issue is not preserved for appeal.Â  See State v.

California, 386 U.S. 738\r\n  (1967), counsel for Grubbs seeks to be relieved.\r\nGrubbs\r\n  disputes the inclusion of the community supervision program (CSP) in his\r\n  sentence because he claims he was sentenced for a first offense and thus ineligible\r\n  for CSP.Â  The State contends Grubbs was sentenced for a third offense and that\r\n  the sentence was, therefore, well within statutory parameters.Â  We are unable\r\n  to determine with certainty from a review of the record, including the\r\n  sentencing sheet, whether Grubbs was sentenced for a first offense or a third\r\n  offense.Â  The sentencing sheet and indictment, however, tend to support the\r\n  Stateâ€™s position that Grubbs was sentenced for a third offense.Â  We note that a\r\n  sentence that exceeds the statutory maximum\r\n  does not implicate subject matter jurisdiction. See State v. Johnston,\r\n  333 S.C. 459, 462, 510 S.E.2d 423, 424 (1999) (holding â€œDefendantâ€™s challenge to the trial courtâ€™s sentencing authority\r\n  does not involve a question of subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction.â€).Â \r\n  Because the argument asserted on this direct review was not presented in the trial court, it is not preserved for review.Â  Cf. State v. Bennett, 375 S.C. 165, 169, 650 S.E.2d 490, 493 (Ct. App. 2007)\r\n  (analyzing the avenues available to an inmate who claims his sentence has\r\n  expired).Â  This court in Bennett granted relief in a direct appeal where\r\n  it was determined that the petitioner had served the maximum sentence and was\r\n  entitled to be released.Â  Conversely, we are presented with a direct appeal\r\n  where it is far from certain that Grubbs received a sentence in excess of that\r\n  authorized by statute.Â  Further, according to the record, Grubbs is out of jail\r\n  and his time within the community supervision program has expired.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we find no preserved issue for direct appellate review.\r\nAfter review of the\r\n  record pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967) and State\r\n    v. Williams, 305 S.C. 116, 406 S.E.2d 357 (1991), we dismiss this appeal\r\n  and grant counselâ€™s petition to be relieved.[1]Â \r\n  The disposition of this direct appeal does not foreclose collateral relief as\r\n  may be provided by law.\r\nAPPEAL\r\n  DISMISSED.Â Â  \r\nHEARN, C.J., HUFF,\r\n  and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-549","title":"Frierson v.

Â She allegedly encountered\r\n  several problems during her eight-month stay at InTown, including noise from\r\n  other guests, waste spilling out of the toilet, harassment by means of a warning\r\n  on Friersonâ€™s car stating it might be towed, and blood stains on her mattress. Â Frierson\r\n  claims InTown participated in unfair trade practices and she suffered severe\r\n  emotional distress as a result of the above events. Â She sought actual damages\r\n  of $5,775 and $1,725 for pain and suffering.Â  In addition, Frierson sought â€œany\r\n  costs resulting in this action and any punitive damages the court deems\r\n  appropriate.â€Â   \r\nAs part\r\n  of its defense, InTown filed a motion to dismiss the case for failure to state\r\n  a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, or alternatively, because Friersonâ€™s\r\n  alleged damages exceeded the $7,500 jurisdictional limit of the magistrateâ€™s\r\n  court. The matter was originally heard by Magistrate Golie Augustus on July 8,\r\n  2003, when he denied the motion to dismiss and set the case for trial on July\r\n  21, 2003.Â  Magistrate William Womble took over for Magistrate Augustus on an\r\n  emergency basis and heard the case on July 21, 2003, and orally dismissed\r\n  Friersonâ€™s Complaint with prejudice. Frierson appealed Magistrate Wombleâ€™s oral\r\n  ruling to the circuit court on July 22, 2003. Â By written order dated July 23,\r\n  2003, Magistrate Womble dismissed the complaint with prejudice in its entirety.\r\n  Â \r\nJudge\r\n  John Milling heard Friersonâ€™s appeal on February 11, 2005.Â  At the hearing, Frierson\r\n  complained that Magistrate Wombleâ€™s signed order went outside the issues heard\r\n  on July 21, 2003. Â Because Judge Milling was concerned that Magistrate Womble\r\n  granted the motion to dismiss after Magistrate Augustus had denied the motion,\r\n  he remanded the case to Magistrate Augustus for the preparation of a return\r\n  concerning the events of July 8, 2003. Â In Magistrate Augustusâ€™s return to the\r\n  appeal, he stated he held a pretrial conference on July 8 and determined that\r\n  the case would be bound over for trial.\r\nBased on Magistrate Augustusâ€™s return, Judge L. Casey Manning\r\n  ordered the case remanded to the magistrateâ€™s court for trial.Â  Frierson then\r\n  sent a fax to Magistrate Womble, dated September 19, 2005, wherein she sought\r\n  to amend her pleadings to seek $500,000 in actual damages and $300,000 in\r\n  punitive damages.Â  She also requested the magistrate forward her case file to\r\n  the circuit court. Â On October 10, 2005, Magistrate Shealy found the amendment for\r\n  additional damages would take the case outside of his jurisdiction and dismissed\r\n  Friersonâ€™s case without prejudice so she could file in the circuit court. Â Having\r\n  commenced the lawsuit on July 1, 2002, Frierson could not file the action with\r\n  the circuit court because the statute of limitations had run.  \r\nFrierson appealed the dismissal without prejudice to the circuit\r\n  court, arguing the magistrate should have transferred the case rather than\r\n  dismiss it.Â  Judge John C. Hayes, III, heard the appeal on April 24, 2006. Â In\r\n  his order filed May 17, 2006, Judge Hayes dismissed Friersonâ€™s appeal and found\r\n  the legislature has not granted jurisdiction to the magistratesâ€™ courts to\r\n  transfer civil cases such as Friersonâ€™s to the circuit court when the\r\n  magistrate no longer has jurisdiction. Â This appeal follows.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFrierson\r\n  argues on appeal that the magistrate erred in not transferring her case to the\r\n  circuit court or hearing the case in its original jurisdiction in the interest\r\n  of justice.Â  She also argues the trial judge failed to address her right to a\r\n  jury trial and failed to address the issue of InTownâ€™s allegedly frivolous\r\n  defense.Â  We affirm.Friersonâ€™s primary\r\n  argument is that the magistrate should have transferred her case to the circuit\r\n  court rather than dismiss it without prejudice.Â  Frierson presents no case law\r\n  to support her position, stating instead that nothing prevents a magistrate\r\n  from sending a case to circuit court. Â We note that although her argument is conclusory,\r\n  we choose to address it on the merits.\r\nThe trial court\r\n  relied upon Rock Hill Body Co. v. Rainey, 294 S.C. 426, 429, 365 S.E.2d\r\n  228, 231 (Ct. App. 1987), for the proposition that in an action with a disputed\r\n  amount in excess of the magistrateâ€™s jurisdiction, the case â€œmust be determined\r\n  by the circuit court in its original jurisdictionâ€ (emphasis added).Â  We\r\n  agree with the trial courtâ€™s interpretation of Rainey.Â  Original\r\n  jurisdiction is defined as â€œ[a] courtâ€™s power to hear and decide a\r\n  matter before any other court can review the matter.â€Â  Blackâ€™s\r\n    Law Dictionary 856 (7th ed. 1999) (emphasis added).\r\nThe jurisdiction\r\n  of the magistratesâ€™ court is statutorily limited by South Carolina Code section\r\n  22-3-10 (2007).Â  Although we note\r\n  there are limited circumstances where the legislature has allowed magistrates\r\n  to transfer a case to the circuit court, such as when a counterclaim is filed\r\n  pursuant to South Carolina Code section 22-3-30 (2007), we believe the legislature\r\n  intentionally limited the scope of a magistrateâ€™s power to transfer cases to\r\n  the circuit court.Â  In addition to Rainey, we find the statutory\r\n  guidelines that govern magistratesâ€™ court support this view by not expressly\r\n  authorizing magistrates to transfer any type of case to the circuit court.Â  \r\n \r\nHaving determined\r\n  that the magistrate properly dismissed Friersonâ€™s case once he lost\r\n  jurisdiction, we find her additional issues are moot.[2]Â  See Sloan v.

Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg; for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Barrett\r\n  Harris (Harris) appeals his conviction for possession of crack cocaine with\r\n  intent to distribute alleging the trial court committed reversible error by\r\n  admitting a National Crime Information Center (NCIC) report into evidence.Â  We\r\n  affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn May 23, 2003, Officer Mixon Eldridge\r\n  (Eldridge) drove his patrol vehicle to an apartment complex to investigate\r\n  reports about illegal drug activity in the area.Â  Eldridge noticed an\r\n  automobile parked in an area that was â€œnot a normal parking space.â€Â  He ran the\r\n  license plate on the vehicle and it came back registered to Harris.Â  He also\r\n  discovered that Harris had three active Greenville County warrants for failure\r\n  to pay child support.  \r\nEldridge\r\n  then confronted Harris as he walked across the parking lot from the car.Â \r\n  Eldridge confirmed Harrisâ€™ identity and placed him under arrest pursuant to the\r\n  outstanding family court warrants.\r\nDuring\r\n  this time another individual, Chris Bruton (Bruton), drove up and parked next\r\n  to Eldridgeâ€™s vehicle.Â  Harris then asked if he could give Bruton some of his\r\n  â€œitems.â€Â  Eldridge agreed to the transfer based upon his experience that it was\r\n  not an unusual request when an arrest is made. Â Eldridge then testified that\r\n  Harris unzipped his pants, reached into his underwear, and handed Bruton a\r\n  black object.Â  Eldridge further testified that he immediately grabbed Brutonâ€™s\r\n  hand and removed the object for his safety.Â Â Â   \r\nThe object\r\n  was a film canister wrapped in black tape that contained twenty-eight rocks of\r\n  crack cocaine weighing approximately four grams.Â  He also subsequently seized a\r\n  police scanner and $329.67 in small denominations incident to arrest.Â Â Â Â \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.â€ State\r\n  v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001); State v.\r\n  Wood, 362 S.C. 520, 525, 608 S.E.2d 435, 438 (Ct. App. 2004). The\r\n  admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound\r\n  discretion of the trial judge. State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545,\r\n  557, 564 S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002). A court's ruling on the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion or the commission of legal error, which results in prejudice to the\r\n  defendant. State v. Edwards, 373 S.C. 230, 234, 644 S.E.2d 66, 68 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2007).Â   \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nHarris alleges\r\n  the trial court erred by allowing a paralegal from the solicitorâ€™s office to\r\n  â€œauthenticateâ€ a NCIC document purporting to show that the automobile Harris\r\n  was driving, at the time of his arrest, was registered in his name consistent\r\n  with officer Eldridgeâ€™s testimony.Harris objected\r\n  to the document on the ground that it was not properly authenticated because Regina\r\n  Wray (Wray) â€œis not competent to attest to or authenticate this document.â€ Â Rule\r\n  901(a), SCRE, requires that exhibits must be authenticated or identified as a\r\n  condition precedent to admissibility.Â  This requirement is satisfied by evidence\r\n  sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its\r\n  proponent claims it to be.Â  Rule 901(b) (1), SCRE, also illustrates that\r\n  testimony from a witness with knowledge can meet this threshold requirement.Â \r\n  Upon review of the record, we find that the document was properly\r\n  authenticated.Â  Wray testified that she was â€œNCIC certifiedâ€ and that stateâ€™s\r\n  exhibit number 6 is the NCIC printout she pulled on her computer just 15\r\n  minutes prior to her testimony.Â  Accordingly, there was sufficient evidence to\r\n  identify the document as being what the state purported it to be.\r\nAside\r\n  from the issue of authentication, while not absolutely clear from the\r\n  objection, an issue remains as to the hearsay nature of the information in an\r\n  NCIC report.[2]Â \r\n  More specifically, this court has not addressed whether the exception to\r\n  hearsay, Rule 803(6), SCRE, is inapplicable because the authenticating witness\r\n  does not satisfy the â€œcustodian or other qualified witnessâ€ requirement.Â  While there is no South Carolina jurisprudence specifically\r\n  addressing the admissibility of NCIC reports, jurisdictions across the country\r\n  have approached the topic with some degree of uniformity.Â  It is widely held\r\n  that NCIC reports are hearsay.\r\n\r\n\tCourts in other jurisdictions have likewise concluded that, whether\r\n  or not NCIC information fits within any exception to the hearsay rule, such\r\n  information is hearsay. See, e.g., United States v. Davis, 568 F.2d 514 (6th Cir.1978); \r\n\tUnited States v. Johnson, 413 F.2d\r\n  1396 (11th Cir. 1969) (noting that NCIC information was double hearsay in that\r\n  witness testified as to what he learned from NCIC and NCIC in turn gathered\r\n  information from other police departments); State v. Broussard, 819 So.2d 1141 (La. Ct. App. 2002); \r\n\tSanders v. State, 786 So.2d\r\n  1078 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001); Dillingham v. Commonwealth, 995\r\n  S.W.2d 377 (Ky. 1999), cert. denied 528 U.S. 1166, 120 S.Ct. 1186, 145 L.Ed.2d\r\n  1092 (2000); State v. Underwood, 286 N.J.Super. 129, 668 A.2d 447\r\n  (1995); Commonwealth v. Travaglia, 541 Pa. 108, 661 A.2d 352\r\n  (1995) (approving trial court's refusal to admit NCIC printout where proponent\r\n  failed to establish proper basis for admitting such under the business records\r\n  exception), cert. denied 516 U.S. 1121, 116 S.Ct. 931, 133 L.Ed.2d 858 (1996);\r\n\tFrye\r\n  v. Commonwealth, 231 Va. 370, 345 S.E.2d 267 (1986) (NCIC printout\r\n  admissible hearsay when it fit within business records exception to the hearsay\r\n  rule); State v. Buck, 670 S.W.2d 600 (Tenn. 1984) (stating that\r\n  information in NCIC reports is pure hearsay of a dubious degree of accuracy,\r\n  prepared for purposes other than court use, contains information that is likely\r\n  to be prejudicial under all circumstances, and is not the best evidence of\r\n  matters that can be proven by reliable, documentary evidence).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Vlietstra v. State, 800 N.E.2d 972, 975 (Ind. Ct. App. 2003).Â   \r\nWe agree with those\r\n  jurisdictions that find that upon laying of a proper foundation, NCIC records\r\n  may be admitted under the business records exception to the hearsay rule.Â  Therefore,\r\n  we must discern whether Wray is a â€œqualified witnessâ€ under Rule 803(6), SCRE,\r\n  so as to satisfy the hearsay exception.\r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina adopted Â§19-5-510 of the South Carolina Code, the Uniform Business\r\n  Record as Evidence Act, prior to the promulgation of the South Carolina Rules\r\n  of Evidence. The statute provides:\r\n\r\n\tA record of an act, condition or event\r\n  shall, insofar as relevant, be competent evidence if the custodian or other\r\n  qualified witness testifies to its identity and the mode of its preparation,\r\n  and if it was made in the regular course of business, at or near the time of\r\n  the act, condition or event and if, in the opinion of the court, the sources of\r\n  information, method and time of preparation were such as to justify its\r\n  admission.\r\n\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 19-5-510 (1976).\r\nâ€œThis\r\n  section gives the trial court control to exclude or require additional proof if\r\n  the authenticity or trustworthiness of the business record is suspect.â€Â  State\r\n  v. Rice, 375 S.C. 302, 652 S.E.2d 409, 423 (Ct. App. 2007) (citing Kershaw County Dep't of Soc. Servs. v.\r\n  McCaskill, 276 S.C. 360, 362, 278 S.E.2d 771, 773 (1981).Â  Rule\r\n  803(6), SCRE, states that:\r\n\r\n\tA memorandum, report,\r\n  record, or data compilation, in any form, of acts, events, conditions, or\r\n  diagnoses, made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a\r\n  person with knowledge, if kept in the course of a regularly conducted business\r\n  activity, and if it was the regular practice of that business activity to make\r\n  the memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, all as shown by the\r\n  testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness, unless the source of information or the method\r\n  or circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness; provided,\r\n  however, that subjective opinions and judgments found in business records are\r\n  not admissible. The term â€œbusinessâ€ as used in this subsection includes\r\n  business, institution, association, profession, occupation, and calling of\r\n  every kind, whether or not conducted for profit.\r\n\r\nA business record without a foundation\r\n  about the manner in which it is prepared or the source of its information does\r\n  not meet the requirements in either Â§19-5-510 or Rule\r\n  803(6), SCRE. See State v. Sarvis, 317 S.C. 102, 107, 450\r\n  S.E.2d 606, 609 (Ct. App. 1994); see also Connelly v.\r\n  Wometco Enterprises, Inc., 314 S.C. 188, 191, 442 S.E.2d 204, 206\r\n  (Ct. App. 1994) (holding employment file, although relevant and otherwise\r\n  admissible, was properly excluded from evidence where the employer failed to\r\n  offer the file through its custodian or another qualifiedwitness); State\r\n  v. McFarlane, 279 S.C. 327, 330, 306 S.E.2d 611, 613 (1983) (finding trial\r\n  court properly refused to admit medical report when no one could testify to the\r\n  identity, mode of preparation, or whether report was made in the regular course\r\n  of business at or near the time of the accident).\r\nMoreover, Rule 803(6) does not require the testifying witness to\r\n  have personally participated in the creation of the document or to know who\r\n  actually recorded the information. Midfirst Bank, SSB v. C.W. Haynes &amp; Co., Inc., 893 F.Supp. 1304, 1311 (D.S.C. 1994) (citing United States v. Keplinger, 776 F.2d 678,\r\n  693 (7th Cir. 1985)). â€œObviously, such a requirement would eviscerate the\r\n  business records exception, since no document could be admitted unless the\r\n  preparer (and possibly others involved in the information-gathering process)\r\n  personally testified as to its creation.â€ Keplinger, 776 F.2d at\r\n  694. Rather, the business records exception requires the witness to be familiar\r\n  with the recordkeeping system. Id. see also United\r\n  States v. Hathaway, 798 F.2d 902, 906 (6th Cir.1986). The phrase\r\n  â€œother qualified witnessâ€ should be\r\n  broadly interpreted. 4 Jack B. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, Weinsteinâ€™s Evidence Â§ 803(6)[2],\r\n  196 -198 (1994).\r\nUpon full\r\n  consideration of the record on appeal, we find that Wray was not a â€œqualified\r\n  witnessâ€ despite that termâ€™s broad interpretation.Â  The record is devoid of any\r\n  evidence as to what exactly â€œNCIC certifiedâ€ signifies, and the only evidence\r\n  of Wrayâ€™s knowledge about the NCIC recordkeeping process was her ability to run\r\n  reports from her computer and her â€œunderstandingâ€ that the information on the\r\n  NCIC report comes from the Department of Motor Vehicles.Â  At least based on\r\n  this record she quite simply seemed to lack the required familiarity with the\r\n  recordkeeping system to establish a proper foundation for the admission of the\r\n  business record.  \r\nHowever, even\r\n  assuming the issue was properly preserved for appeal, the admission of the NCIC\r\n  report was clearly cumulative and harmless.Â  Wray fully testified as to the contents of the\r\n  printout before the motion was made to have it entered into evidence.Â \r\n  Specifically, she testified that it was a â€œtag check,â€ which she ran on license\r\n  plate number 390-RFL that â€œcame back to a 1983 BMW. . . . And it was registered\r\n  to a Barrett Bernard Harris.â€ Â Officer Eldridge also testified without\r\n  objection that he ran a check of the plates on the BMW and the plates were\r\n  registered to Harris, supplying the probable cause necessary for the original\r\n  arrest.\r\nBoth\r\n  Officer Eldridge and Wray testified as to the same information that was\r\n  contained in the NCIC printout.Â  Moreover, there was never any contemporaneous objection\r\n  made to Wrayâ€™s testimony.[3]Â \r\n  â€œ[I]t is well settled that a contemporaneous objection must be made to preserve\r\n  an argument for appellate review.â€Â  Washington v. Whitaker, 317\r\n  S.C. 108, 114, 451 S.E.2d 894, 898 (1994).Â   \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  even if we were to determine that the trial court erred in allowing the\r\n  printout to be admitted into evidence, such error would be harmless.Â  â€œUnder settled\r\n  principles, the admission of improper evidence is harmless where it is merely\r\n  cumulative to other evidence.â€Â  State v. Blackburn, 271 S.C. 324, 329, 247\r\n  S.E.2d 334, 337 (1978) (citing Long et al. v. Conroy et al., 246 S.C.\r\n  225, 143 S.E.2d 459 (1965); Marsh Plywood Corp. v. S. C. State Highway Dept.\r\n  et al., 258 S.C. 119, 187 S.E.2d 515 (1972)).Â  The testimony of both\r\n  officer Eldridge and Wray indicates that the vehicle was registered to Harris.Â \r\n  TheÂ  NCIC printout is merely cumulative.Â  The only evidence contrary to this\r\n  position was offered by Harrisâ€™ mother Joanne Harris.Â  Ms. Harris testified\r\n  that the vehicle was registered in her name, but that â€œhe did most of the\r\n  driving.â€[4]Â Â   \r\nMoreover,\r\n  the issue to which the evidence was relevant was collateral in that it did not\r\n  relate to one of the elements of the charge.Â  The document itself contained no\r\n  new information that was not already admitted through witness testimony.Â  Any\r\n  error in the admission of evidence which is cumulative to other evidence that was\r\n  proffered without objection is harmless.Â  State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C.\r\n  502, 507, 435 S.E.2d 859, 862 (1993).Â  Error that is insubstantial and unlikely\r\n  to affect the result of the trial is rarely sufficient to warrant reversal.Â  State\r\n  v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 176, 399 S.E.2d 595, 597 (1991).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAfter full consideration of the record on appeal, we\r\n  find that any error by the trial court was harmless.Â  Accordingly, Harrisâ€™\r\n  conviction and sentence for possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute\r\n  is hereby  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and PIEPER, JJ., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] While it is questionable whether Harris properly\r\n  preserved the issue as it relates to the business records exception to hearsay,\r\n  we nevertheless address the issue since we ultimately conclude that any error\r\n  was harmless.Â  Generally, an objection must â€œbe sufficiently specific to bring\r\n  into focus the precise nature of the alleged error so that it can be reasonably\r\n  understood by the trial judge.â€Â  State v. Holliday, 333 S.C. 332, 338, 509\r\n  S.E.2d 280, 283 (Ct. App. 1998) (quoting McKissick v. J.F. Cleckley &amp;\r\n  Co., 325 S.C. 327, 344, 479 S.E.2d 67, 75 (Ct. App. 1996)).\r\n[3] While the record indicates a bench conference\r\n  took place before the witness testified, the conference was not proffered for\r\n  the record.Â  However, a complete reading of the record suggests that after the\r\n  witness testified and the court was asked to admit the document, counsel\r\n  indicated that it was subject to his earlier objection (which we assume\r\n  occurred during the bench conference).Â  He offered an additional basis\r\n  for the objection only after Wray testified; he asserted she was not qualified\r\n  to attest to or authenticate the document.Â  Thus, the objection addressed only\r\n  the document itself rather than the testimony.Â  That foundational objection\r\n  should have been presented to the court prior to her testimony and was\r\n  therefore untimely.\r\n[4] At the conclusion of Wrayâ€™s testimony and\r\n  following the admission of the NCIC report, the judge asked Ms. Harris why he\r\n  should not hold her in contempt and send her to jail for lying about the name under\r\n  which the car was registered.Â  Ms. Harris claimed that she did not deliberately\r\n  mislead the court and that there was some confusion over whether her name was\r\n  just on the insurance or was also on the car.Â  At sentencing, Mr. Harris told\r\n  the judge â€œshe didnâ€™t own the car; it was the insurance.Â  The insurance was in\r\n  her name, not the car.â€Â  Her statement at trial was the only reason the NCIC\r\n  report was offered into evidence and Mr. Harris claimed that she was just\r\n  confused.Â  However, because Mr. Harrisâ€™ statement was made during the\r\n  sentencing phase of his trial, it was not considered in addressing the merits\r\n  of the issue before the court.Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-552","title":"State v.

Â Brown, all of Columbia; and Solicitor C.\r\n  Kelly Jackson, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â \r\n  Reginald Tyrell Clea (Clea) was convicted of one count of murder and possession\r\n  of a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence.Â  He was acquitted on\r\n  a second murder charge.Â  On appeal, Clea argues the trial judge erred in not\r\n  charging the jury on the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter. Â Â We\r\n  affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nClea\r\n  admittedly shot and killed Charles Jackson (Jackson) and James Pollard\r\n  (Pollard).Â  John Lee Powell (Lee) testified he was with Pollard the day of the\r\n  shootings.Â  Pollard picked Lee up earlier in the day, and they were later\r\n  joined by Maurice Young (Young).Â  They drove together to Rembert to find Clea\r\n  and buy doghouses from him.Â  Pollard and Clea had shared a residence prior to\r\n  the shootings and had bred dogs.Â  Clea left several dogs at Pollardâ€™s new home,\r\n  and the dogs did not have doghouses.Â  Â Â Pollard paid Clea for the doghouses,\r\n  and all four men amicably loaded them onto Cleaâ€™s truck.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  group drove to Pollardâ€™s new home and, as they were unloading, Jackson arrived in his car.Â  Jackson spoke cordially with Lee and then approached Pollard.Â \r\n  The group continued to interact in a friendly manner when Jackson called Clea\r\n  over to Jacksonâ€™s car so he could â€œshowâ€ him â€œsomething.â€Â  Lee said Jacksonâ€™s tone was good natured.Â  When Lee heard the first shots, his back was to Clea, but\r\n  he turned to see Clea shooting at Jackson.Â  He asked Clea why he was shooting at\r\n  Jackson, and Clea repeatedly answered that Jackson had a gun.Â  Clea fired\r\n  again as Jackson crawled through his car to exit the passenger side.Â  Lee told\r\n  Clea to stop shooting, but Clea again replied Jackson had a gun.Â  Lee never saw\r\n  Jackson with a gun, nor did he hear shots come from Jacksonâ€™s direction.\r\n \r\nPollard,\r\n  who was near the car, asked Clea why he was shooting at Jackson and Clea turned\r\n  towards him.Â  As Pollard walked towards Clea repeating his question, Clea\r\n  started shooting at Pollard.Â  Lee did not see a weapon on Pollard and had no indication\r\n  he was armed.Â  He heard Clea ask Jackson to show his hand, but Lee was unable\r\n  to observe Jackson who now lay on the ground on the opposite side of the car.Â  Jackson yelled numerous times for Pollard to tell Clea he didnâ€™t have a gun, however\r\n  Pollard had already been shot.Â  After Lee and Young left the yard, Lee heard\r\n  another set of gunfire.\r\nYoung\r\n  testified to being at Pollardâ€™s home unloading the doghouses.Â  Soon after Jackson arrived, he heard gunshots and turned to see Clea shoot at Jackson.Â  He didnâ€™t see\r\n  Jackson shoot back and saw no gun other than Cleaâ€™s.Â  After the first shots,\r\n  he recalled Clea said Jackson was going to get a gun. Â Jackson stated, â€œno, I\r\n  ainâ€™t got no gun, I ainâ€™t got no gun.â€Â  Young heard Lee tell Clea to put the\r\n  gun down, and he heard more shots as he left the yard.\r\nAccording\r\n  to Cleaâ€™s testimony, he sold the doghouses to Pollard as a last detail from\r\n  their having lived together.Â  He explained he had previous difficulties with the\r\n  victims and knew both had reputations for violence.Â  The day of the shooting, Pollard\r\n  and Young stopped him on the road to discuss the doghouses.Â  No one was upset\r\n  and no â€œcross wordsâ€ were exchanged.Â  Clea helped load the doghouses onto his\r\n  truck, drove them to Pollardâ€™s residence, and unloaded one with Pollardâ€™s\r\n  help.Â  Jackson drove up shortly afterwards, and they worked together to unload\r\n  another doghouse.Â   \r\nWhen\r\n  Jackson told Clea he needed to talk with him, Clea reported he was not\r\n  suspicious at first. Â But, as he walked toward the car and his truck, â€œa chill\r\n  went up [his] back.â€Â  Because he did not want to speak with Jackson, he\r\n  continued towards his truck â€œso [he] could leave.â€Â  As Clea was about to sit in\r\n  the truck, he saw Jackson reach into the carâ€™s backseat and pick up a shoebox.Â \r\n  Jackson continued to call Clea to the car.Â  While Clea â€œwas stalling . . .Â \r\n  putting Vaseline on my lips because it was cold,â€ Jackson began â€œtalking\r\n  aggressively.â€Â  Clea thought Jackson was going to get a gun from the box.Â  He\r\n  told Jackson, â€œif you want me to come over there, why you donâ€™t come to me.Â \r\n  And thatâ€™s when [Jackson] be like, nah, I want you to come to me.Â  And thatâ€™s\r\n  when I slammed my backseat back, threw on my jacketâ€ and reached for the loaded\r\n  assault rifle.Â   \r\nClea\r\n  said he couldnâ€™t leave because no safe exit from the yard was available.Â  â€œ[A]t\r\n  first,â€ he didnâ€™t think Jackson had a gun; but, when he saw that Jackson â€œwas clamping on to something,â€ he thought â€œlike, man, forget thatâ€ and shot at\r\n  the front of the car in which Jackson sat.Â  He called these first shots\r\n  â€œwarning signs,â€ and he told Jackson â€œto let [him] leave from the scene because\r\n  [he] was about to leave anyway.â€Â  When Clea demanded â€œlet me see your hand,â€ Jackson did not comply.Â  The solicitor asked Clea:\r\n \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tWas there anything that he did \r\n\t\t\tthat provoked you into a fight with him?&nbsp; Is there anything he \r\n\t\t\tdid to make you mad?&nbsp; Did he call you a name or do anything \r\n\t\t\tlike that that got you heated up?&nbsp; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tWhat got me heated up was he \r\n\t\t\twouldnâ€™t show me his hands. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tAll right, what Iâ€™m trying to \r\n\t\t\task you is if there was any hostility, if there was anything that \r\n\t\t\tgot you mad at him, angry at him, outraged at him?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tI never said I was mad.&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tWhatâ€™s that?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tWhoever said I was mad?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tIâ€™m asking you that.&nbsp; Are \r\n\t\t\tyou telling me you werenâ€™t mad?

Twenty-one were determined to have been fired from Cleaâ€™s gun.Â  The remaining six cartridges, though inconclusive, were the proper\r\n  caliber for the same gun.Â  No weapons were found in the yard or in any\r\n  vehicles.Â  Gunshot residue testing on Pollardâ€™s right hand indicated lead\r\n  counts higher than would be expected had he fired a gun.Â  The SLED technician\r\n  found it more consistent with a hand being on the muzzle end of a gun.Â  From\r\n  the residue found on Jacksonâ€™s hand, the technician reasoned he either could\r\n  have fired a gun or a gun was fired in his vicinity.Â  Testing of the shoebox\r\n  was positive suggesting a gun had been placed in the box after being fired or\r\n  that the box was open when a gun was fired nearby.Â   \r\nDefense\r\n  counsel requested a charge on voluntary manslaughter arguing the appearance of\r\n  danger or the gesture of reaching for a weapon can adequately provide the\r\n  necessary provocation.Â  The State objected stating no evidence showed sudden\r\n  heat of passion or sufficient legal provocation.Â  After the trial judge\r\n  considered the issue and reviewed the case law overnight, he ruled against the\r\n  request finding no sudden heat of passion.Â  He explained:\r\n\r\n\t[F]or the Court to charge voluntary\r\n  manslaughter, the law requires a sudden heat of passion brought about upon\r\n  sufficient legal provocation.\r\n\tI find\r\n  in this instance that the evidence does not support a charge of voluntary\r\n  manslaughter.Â  That the evidence presented by the Defense best supports a\r\n  self-defense charge in that there is no evidence of any sudden heat of\r\n  passion.Â  That the case law required some degree of assault, and in addition to\r\n  that, something that might have provoked the killing.\r\n\tThat in this\r\n  case, at best, the Defendantâ€™s testimony concerning the â€“ what he thought was a\r\n  presence of a gun, indicates possibly some provocation but it does not conjure\r\n  up any sudden heat of passion.Â  That the prior incidents between parties could\r\n  not create a sudden heat of passion, but any passion regarding that, in\r\n  addition to the Defendantâ€™s testimony about firing the shots regarding warning\r\n  the Defendant [sic] or something of that nature, in and of itself does not\r\n  indicate any sudden heat of passion and Iâ€™m not going to charge manslaughter.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  law to be charged must be determined from the evidence presented at trial.Â  State\r\n    v. Childers, 373 S.C. 367, 373, 645 S.E.2d 233, 235 (2006); State v.\r\n      Cole, 338 S.C. 97, 101, 525 S.E.2d 511, 512 (2000).Â  â€œDue process requires\r\n  that a lesser included offense be charged when the evidence warrants it but\r\n  only if the evidence would permit a jury rationally to find the defendant\r\n  guilty of the lesser offense.â€Â  State v. Small, 307 S.C. 92, 94, 413\r\n  S.E.2d 870, 871 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  â€œIn determining whether the evidence requires\r\n  a charge on voluntary manslaughter, this Court must view the facts in the light\r\n  most favorable to the defendant.Â Â  Childers, 373 S.C. at 373, 645 S.E.2d\r\n  at 235.Â  To justify a courtâ€™s eliminating the offense of manslaughter, it\r\n  should clearly appear that there is no evidence whatsoever tending to reduce\r\n  the crime from murder to manslaughter.Â  Id.Â   \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nClea\r\n  argues he was entitled to a charge of voluntary manslaughter given the facts of\r\n  this case.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nâ€œVoluntary\r\n  manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being in the sudden heat of\r\n  passion upon sufficient legal provocation. Both heat of passion and sufficient\r\n  legal provocation must be present at the time of the killing.â€Â  State v.\r\n    Smith, 363 S.C. 111, 609 S.E.2d 528 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing State v.\r\n      Cooley, 342 S.C. 63, 67, 536 S.E.2d 666, 668 (2000)).Â  â€œThe sudden heat of\r\n  passion, upon sufficient legal provocation, which mitigates a felonious killing\r\n  to manslaughter, while it need not dethrone reason entirely, or shut out\r\n  knowledge and volition, must be such as would naturally disturb the sway of\r\n  reason, and render the mind of an ordinary person incapable of cool reflection,\r\n  and produce what, according to human experience, may be called an\r\n  uncontrollable impulse to do violence.â€Â  State v. Walker, 324 S.C. 257,\r\n  260, 478 S.E.2d 280, 281 (1996) (citing State v. Byrd, 323 S.C. 319, 474\r\n  S.E.2d 430 (1996)).Â  When there is no evidence of sudden heat of passion upon\r\n  sufficient legal provocation, the courtâ€™s refusal to instruct the jury on\r\n  voluntary manslaughter is proper.Â  Id.\r\nViewing\r\n  the evidence in the light most favorable to Clea, we find he did not act in the\r\n  sudden heat of passion. Â Clea testified that, in the moments before the\r\n  shooting, he was â€œsuspicious,â€ walked away from the victims, stalled at his\r\n  truck, negotiated with Jackson to come to his truck to speak, and asked to be\r\n  allowed to leave.Â  We find these statements demonstrate cool reflection.Â  Clea explained\r\n  he was â€œheated upâ€ by Jacksonâ€™s not showing his hands.Â  But, further\r\n  strengthening our determination, he said he was â€œjust precautiousâ€ and not mad.Â \r\n  Although he said Pollard provoked him by reaching into his waist, he again asserted\r\n  he was not mad but simply defending himself.Â  See State v. Walker,\r\n  324 S.C. 257, 478 S.E.2d 280 (1996) (no sudden heat of passion where defendant\r\n  tried to diffuse argument and give victim time to cool off); State v. Rogers,\r\n  275 S.C. 485, 272 S.E.2d 792 (1980) (defendantâ€™s testimony he was not mad when\r\n  he shot wife and stepdaughter, together with his insanity defense, precluded\r\n  voluntary manslaughter charge); cf. State v. Wiggins, 330 S.C. 538, 500 S.E.2d 489 (1998) (evidence tended to show defendant acted in sudden heat of passion where he was in a heated argument\r\n  with victim and feared for his life because victim threatened him); State v.\r\n    Lowry, 315 S.C. 396, 434 S.E.2d 272 (1993) (holding a voluntary\r\n  manslaughter charge was necessary where defendant and victim were in a heated\r\n  argument and victim was about to initiate a physical encounter when shooting\r\n  occurred); State v. Davis, 278 S.C. 544, 298 S.E.2d 778 (1983) (holding\r\n  voluntary manslaughter charge was proper where a witness testified that\r\n  defendant and victim had been fighting).\r\nBecause\r\n  there is clearly no evidence to show Clea acted in the sudden heat of passion,\r\n  we will not reach the issue of whether sufficient legal provocation existed.Â \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  trial judge properly found Clea did not act in the sudden heat of passion and\r\n  did not err in refusing to charge the lesser included offense of voluntary\r\n  manslaughter.Â  Accordingly, Cleaâ€™s convictions are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, SHORT AND WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-553","title":"In the Matter of the Care and Treatment of Robert Lee Cogdill","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayUnPubOpinion.cfm?caseNo=2007-UP-553","description":null,"date":"2007-12-14","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS OPINION HAS NO PRECEDENTIAL VALUE.Â  IT SHOULD NOT BE\r\n  CITED OR RELIED ON AS PRECEDENT IN ANY PROCEEDING EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY RULE\r\n  239(d)(2), SCACR.\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Matter\r\n      of the Care and Treatment of Robert Lee Cogdill, Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Greenwood County\r\nÂ Marc H.

McIntosh, Assistant Attorney General Deborah R.J. Shupe, Office\r\n  of the Attorney General, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Robert\r\n  Lee Cogdill appeals the trial judgeâ€™s refusal to grant a directed verdict â€œon\r\n  the charge that [he] was a sexually violent predator since there was no direct\r\n  or substantial circumstantial evidence on a personal level, rather than as a\r\n  matter of statistics, that [he] was likely to engage in acts of sexual violence\r\n  if he was not confined to a secure facility for . . . long term care and\r\n  treatment, particularly where the stateâ€™s expert did not conduct any testing on\r\n  [him] before . . . rendering her general opinion.â€Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn\r\n  1986, Cogdill plead guilty to committing a lewd act on a minor and was\r\n  sentenced to five years probation.Â  In 1988, he plead guilty to two counts of\r\n  first degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor and was sentenced to thirty\r\n  years incarceration.Â  Prior to Cogdillâ€™s scheduled release date, the State of\r\n  South Carolina filed a petition pursuant to the South Carolina Sexually Violent\r\n  Predator Act, South Carolina Code section 44-48-100 (Supp. 2006), seeking to\r\n  have Cogdill civilly committed for long term care and treatment as a sexually\r\n  violent predator.\r\nThe\r\n  matter was called for a jury trial on May 17, 2005.Â  Following the close of the\r\n  Stateâ€™s case, Cogdillâ€™s attorney made a motion for a directed verdict.Â \r\n  Specifically, Cogdillâ€™s attorney argued that the testimony of the Stateâ€™s sole\r\n  witness was not based on individual testing or observations of Cogdill and\r\n  there was no evidence that Cogdill had â€œserious difficultyâ€ controlling his\r\n  behavior as required by Kansas v. Crane, 534 U.S. 407, 122 S.Ct. 867\r\n  (2002). Â The circuit court denied the motion for a directed verdict. At the\r\n  conclusion of the trial, the jury found Cogdill was a sexually violent\r\n  predator, and the trial judge, by order filed May 18, 2005, committed Cogdill\r\n  to the custody of the South Carolina Department of Mental Health for long term\r\n  control, care, and treatment.Â  Â Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the denial of a motion for directed verdict, this Court applies\r\n  the same standard as the trial court. Elam v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp.,\r\n  361 S.C. 9, 27, 602 S.E.2d 772, 782 (2004). The Court is required to view the\r\n  evidence and inferences that\r\n  reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving\r\n  party. Sabb v. S.C. State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 428, 567 S.E.2d 231, 237\r\n  (2002). When deciding whether to grant or deny a\r\n  directed verdict motion, the court is concerned only with the existence of\r\n  evidence. Pond Place Partners v.

Â During cross examination, Cogdillâ€™s\r\n  attorney thoroughly questioned Dr. Crawford on the methods she used and the\r\n  fact no psychological testing\r\n  was performed on Cogdill.  \r\nThe testimony of Dr. Crawford provides sufficient evidence to\r\n  justify the trial judgeâ€™s denial of Cogdillâ€™s motion and satisfies the mandate\r\n  of Crane.Â  See In re\r\n    Care &amp; Treatment of Harvey,&nbsp;355\r\n  S.C. 53, 59-61, 584 S.E.2d 893, 896-7&nbsp;(2003) (stating that the requirements of the Sexually Violent Predator Act are the\r\n  functional equivalent of the requirement in Crane and finding\r\n  sufficient evidence where a psychiatrist testified she diagnosed the offender\r\n  with pedophilia and the offender met the statutory definition of a sexually\r\n  violent predator).Â  Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the order of the trial judge is  \r\nAFFIRMED.  \r\nANDERSON,\r\n  SHORT, and WILLIAMS JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-554","title":"Harris v.

Harris filed this action against Penn Warranty Corporation (Penn) and\r\n  West Main Automotive (West Main) arising out of Harrisâ€™ purchase of an\r\n  automobile.Â  Harris appeals the trial courtâ€™s order granting a motion to compel\r\n  settlement.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThis action was settled on the record\r\n  after Harris presented his case during a jury trial.Â  The trial court dismissed\r\n  the action.[2]Â \r\n  Penn and West Main remitted the settlement checks to Harris.Â  Harris returned\r\n  the checks and refused to honor the settlement.  \r\nWest Main and Penn moved to compel settlement.[3]Â \r\n  At the hearing on the motion, Harris argued that although he agreed to the\r\n  settlement on the record, he misunderstood the procedural posture of the case\r\n  and disagreed with his attorney regarding settlement.Â  The court granted the\r\n  motion to compel settlement.Â   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHarris\r\n  argues his attorney â€œentrappedâ€ him into making the settlement and the\r\n  settlement is unfair.Â  â€œIt is a long-standing and well-settled rule that an\r\n  attorney may settle litigation on behalf of his client and that the client is\r\n  bound by his attorneyâ€™s settlement actions.â€Â  Motley v.

Vance Stricklin, Jr. and Katherine Carruth Link, both of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: The\r\n  family court judge granted Ernest Matthew West (Husband) and Mary Denise\r\n  West (Wife) a divorce on the ground of one year continuous separation.Â  The\r\n  judge granted Wife custody of the partiesâ€™ two minor children and granted\r\n  Husband visitation rights.Â  In addition, the judge prohibited Husband from\r\n  traveling with the children outside of the State of South Carolina during his\r\n  visitation.Â  Husband appeals the travel restriction claiming the family court\r\n  judge abused his discretion in failing to apply proper legal principles and\r\n  imposing an unreasonable restriction contrary to the childrenâ€™s best interests.Â \r\n  We reverse.  \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were married on November\r\n  18, 1992.Â  The parties had two children during their marriage, a daughter, now\r\n  nine years old, and a son, now six years old.Â  During the early years of the\r\n  marriage, Wife worked as a school teacher.Â  When the children were born, the\r\n  parties agreed Wife would stop working and stay at home with the children.Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nIn 2002, Husbandâ€™s employer, Saftey Kleen Corporation, went\r\n  bankrupt and closed its Columbia office.Â  The employer offered Husband a\r\n  position in the companyâ€™s Dallas, Texas office.Â  Husband moved to Texas, and Wife remained in South Carolina with the children.Â  After one year in Texas, Husband moved to Miami, Florida, to pursue a new employment opportunity.Â \r\n \r\nHusbandâ€™s\r\n  absence put a strain on the marital relationship, and on February 23, 2004,\r\n  Wife brought an action for separate maintenance, custody of the children, and\r\n  child support.Â  Husband filed an answer and counterclaim requesting the courtâ€™s\r\n  approval to reside separate and apart from Wife and seeking joint custody of\r\n  the children.Â  At the temporary hearing, the family court judge awarded sole\r\n  temporary custody of the children to Wife and awarded Husband visitation\r\n  rights.Â  Because Husband was still living in Miami, Husbandâ€™s visitation was\r\n  limited to his parentsâ€™ home in Kershaw, South Carolina.Â  During the\r\n  separation, Husband traveled to South Carolina every other weekend to visit\r\n  with the children.Â  Eventually, Husband purchased and moved into a home in Greenville,   South Carolina, within fifteen miles of Wife and children.Â \r\n \r\nAt the\r\n  final hearing, Wife moved to supplement her pleadings and seek a divorce on the\r\n  ground of one year separation.Â  Additionally, Wife sought supervised visitation\r\n  for Husband because of his: (1) controlling nature; (2) unstable lifestyle; (3)\r\n  temper; and (4) credibility.Â  Further, Wife expressed concern Husband was\r\n  involved in a homosexual affair and believed Husband presented a threat of harm\r\n  to the children.Â  Husband denied the adulterous affair throughout most of the\r\n  divorce litigation.Â  It was not until a week before the final hearing that\r\n  Husband admitted he had an affair.Â   \r\nHusband admitted he had not been honest about his adulterous\r\n  conduct during the divorce proceedings and regretted not disclosing it earlier\r\n  in the litigation.Â  Husband stated he came forward shortly before the hearing\r\n  because he â€œdid not want to finish whatever happens with this on an untruthful\r\n  note.â€Â  Husband stated he never had, and did not intend to have, his children\r\n  around his paramour.Â  He also stated he had no problem with an order\r\n  prohibiting him from bringing the children around his paramour.Â   \r\nThe judge awarded full custody of the children to Wife and granted\r\n  Husband a â€œstandardâ€ unsupervised visitation schedule.Â  In addition, the judge\r\n  imposed a restriction on Husband that he was not to remove the children from\r\n  the State of South Carolina during the exercise of his visitation.Â \r\n  Additionally, the judge â€œrestrained [Husband] from exposing the children to any\r\n  non-spouse romantic companion or relationship.â€[1]Â   \r\nHusband\r\n  filed a motion seeking to alter or amend the final divorce decree to allow\r\n  Husband to have visitation outside the confines of South Carolina and the award\r\n  of attorney fees.Â  The judge denied the motion, concluding that â€œrestricting\r\n  [Husbandâ€™s] visitation to the State of South Carolina is reasonable and\r\n  protects the . . . children.â€Â  This appeal followed.[2]\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the\r\n  family court, the appellate court has the authority to correct errors of law\r\n  and to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102\r\n  (2005); Miller v. Miller, 299 S.C. 307, 311, 384 S.E.2d 715, 717\r\n  (1989).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require this court to\r\n  disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Lacke v. Lacke, 362 S.C. 302,\r\n  307, 608 S.E.2d 147, 149 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Nor must we ignore the fact that the\r\n  family court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position\r\n  to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their\r\n  testimony.Â  Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623\r\n  (2003).Â   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHusband claims the\r\n  family court judge erred in imposing a travel restriction on his visitation\r\n  because it was based solely on the judgeâ€™s moral condemnation of Husbandâ€™s\r\n  lifestyle absent any evidence his conduct adversely affected the welfare of his\r\n  children.[3]Â \r\n  We agree.Â   \r\nWhen\r\n  awarding visitation, the paramount consideration is the welfare of the child.Â  Woodall\r\n    v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 12, 471 S.E.2d 154, 158 (1996).Â  A parentâ€™s\r\n  morality, while a proper factor for consideration, is limited in its force to\r\n  what relevancy it has, either directly or indirectly to the welfare of the\r\n  child.Â  Davenport v. Davenport, 265 S.C. 524, 527, 220 S.E.2d\r\n  228, 230 (1975); Stroman v. Williams, 291 S.C. 376, 378, 353 S.E.2d 704,\r\n  705 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  In Stroman, this court\r\n  recognized homosexuality, in and of itself, is not a bar to custody or\r\n  reasonable rights of visitation.Â  Stroman, 291 S.C. at 379, 353\r\n  S.E.2d at 706 (citing Marriage of Cabalquinto, 100 Wash.2d 325, 669 P.2d\r\n  886 (1983)).Â  Nor are a parentâ€™s sexual indiscretions a proper consideration\r\n  unless they are shown to adversely affect the welfare of the child.Â  Id. (citing Guinan v. Guinan, 102 A.D.2d 963, 477 N.Y.S.2d 830) (1984)).Â  In\r\n  Judge Sandersâ€™ concurrence he explained: â€œNo moral judgment by us has been\r\n  necessary because there is no evidence that [the parentâ€™s] lifestyle had any\r\n  relevancy to the welfare of the child.â€Â  Id. at 381, 353 S.E.2d 706-07\r\n  (C.J. Sanders concurring).Â  Furthermore, while the issue of visitation rests\r\n  largely within the discretion of the trial judge, visitation is not to be used\r\n  to penalize or reward a parent for his or her conduct.Â  Stroman, 291\r\n  S.C. at 378, 353 S.E.2d at 705.Â  We are bound by this courtâ€™s prior precedent.\r\nIn deciding to impose restrictions on Husbandâ€™s visitation, the\r\n  judge â€œ[felt] it necessary to impose specific restrictions related to the\r\n  [Husbandâ€™s] actionsâ€ because he did not condone Husbandâ€™s alternative\r\n  lifestyle.Â  The judge acknowledged the travel restriction was an\r\n  â€œunusual restriction, . . . based on the [Husbandâ€™s] self-indulgent and deviant\r\n  lifestyleâ€ but â€œnecessary to protect the morality of the children.â€Â  The judge\r\n  further iterated:\r\n\r\n\tThe [Husband] chose an inappropriate relationship over his\r\n  marriage.Â  He admitted that he undertook a covenant with his wife and with a\r\n  higher power which was broken.Â  Based on his willingness to break this covenant\r\n  and pursue an adulterous relationship . . . [Husbandâ€™s] visitation should be\r\n  confined to the State of South Carolina to protect the best interest of the\r\n  minor children.Â  \r\n\r\nIn the denial of Husbandâ€™s motion to alter or amend, the judge provided\r\n  further reasoning for the travel restriction.Â  The judge reasoned the proximity\r\n  would encourage compliance and found Husband would be â€œless likely to be\r\n  distracted by the pursuit of his other relationship, and as a result, the\r\n  children are more likely to receive quality time with their father.â€Â  The judge\r\n  concluded, â€œ[i]f [Husband] is allowed to take the children out of state, he is\r\n  more likely to expose the children to a harmful situation including exposure to\r\n  his paramour who lives out of state.â€Â  \r\nIt is clear the judge imposed a visitation restriction based on\r\n  moral considerations and his disapproval of Husbandâ€™s adulterous conduct.Â  We\r\n  find it was proper for the judge to consider Husbandâ€™s morality as a factor in\r\n  determining visitation rights. Â However, this consideration must be limited to\r\n  the extent it was shown to adversely impact upon the welfare of the children. Â We\r\n  are not asked here to condone conduct which may not be condoned by segments of\r\n  society; instead, we are not only asked whether the parent has been\r\n  inappropriately penalized for such conduct, but also, and more precisely,\r\n  whether the childrenâ€™s interaction with a biological parent may be so\r\n  restricted as a consequence thereof contrary to their best interests. After a\r\n  review of the evidence, we find there was no evidence that Husbandâ€™s conduct\r\n  endangered or adversely affected the welfare of the children.\r\nIn this case the appointed Guardian ad Litem (GAL) submitted a\r\n  written report and testified at the hearing.Â  In her report, the GAL expressed\r\n  concern with Husbandâ€™s lack of candor concerning his sexuality, but found no\r\n  evidence Husband had the children around any paramour or subjected the children\r\n  to an alternative lifestyle.Â  Further, the GAL stated â€œI have found no reason\r\n  to believe that [Husband] has ever done anything to the children that would\r\n  place them in danger or that that he would do so in the future.â€Â  She\r\n  concluded, â€œI believe it would be in the best interest of the children that the\r\n  children have contact with both parents on a regular basis â€¦ [and] I believe it\r\n  is in the best interest of the children that both parents have time alone with\r\n  the children.â€Â  At the hearing, the GAL stated she saw no reason to limit\r\n  Husbandâ€™s visitation and found nothing to indicate the children would be at\r\n  risk if Husband traveled with the children out of South Carolina.Â Â Â Â   \r\nDr.\r\n  Watson, the expert clinical psychologist appointed by the court to determine\r\n  whether Husband was a danger to his children, also testified at the hearing.Â \r\n  Dr. Watson testified Husband was not a threat to his children and did not need\r\n  to be supervised around his children.Â  He acknowledged Husbandâ€™s deception and\r\n  expressed some concern, but did not believe Husbandâ€™s lying presented a threat\r\n  of harm to the children.Â  Dr. Watson did not recommend supervision for the\r\n  Husband.Â Â Â   \r\nMoreover,\r\n  the judgeâ€™s initial evaluation specifically found no evidence Husband exposed\r\n  the children to the relationship, encouraged the children to pursue â€œa deviant\r\n  or alternative lifestyle,â€ or that his lifestyle would lead to â€œother conduct\r\n  detrimental to the children.â€  \r\nWife contends the restriction was not imposed as a penalty for\r\n  Husbandâ€™s adulterous affair, but was based on the judgeâ€™s concern for the\r\n  welfare of the children.Â  Wife avers the judge grounded his restriction on\r\n  genuine concerns of Husbandâ€™s character and behavior, including his controlling\r\n  nature, unstable lifestyle, temper, and lack of credibility.Â  She argues these\r\n  concerns were apart from his adulterous conduct.Â   \r\nIn determining visitation in the final divorce decree, the judge specifically\r\n  addressed each of Wifeâ€™s concerns about Husbandâ€™s character and behavior.Â  The\r\n  judge concluded the evidence of Husbandâ€™s controlling nature, unstable\r\n  lifestyle, temper, or lack of credibility did not rise to the level of\r\n  requiring supervised visitation.Â  Accordingly, the judge found no reason to\r\n  require supervised visitation and thereby granted Husband a â€œstandardâ€\r\n  unsupervised visitation schedule.Â  Clearly, the judge did not find sufficient\r\n  evidence that Husbandâ€™s character or conduct raised sufficient concern for the\r\n  welfare of the children such as to require supervised visitation.Â  Even as to\r\n  Husbandâ€™s untimely disclosure of his conduct, Â the trial judge found that while\r\n  Husband had been untruthful throughout the litigation and had created an\r\n  atmosphere of distrust, visitation should not be used to reward or penalize a\r\n  parent. Â Thus, we find these aspects of Husbandâ€™s character were of concern\r\n  only insofar as they related to the fear that Husbandâ€™s conduct would endanger\r\n  the children.Â  It is apparent that, but for Husbandâ€™s prior sexual misconduct,\r\n  the judge would not have concluded the children needed â€œprotection.â€Â  The\r\n  record simply does not support Wifeâ€™s argument the travel restriction was based\r\n  on genuine concerns about Husbandâ€™s character and behavior, apart from his\r\n  adulterous conduct.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on this courtâ€™s prior precedent, we respectfully conclude\r\n  the judge improperly imposed a travel restriction on Husbandâ€™s visitation with\r\n  his children.Â  Absent any evidence that Husbandâ€™s adulterous conduct endangered\r\n  or adversely impacted the welfare of his children, we hold the judge\r\n  impermissibly penalized Husband for his conduct and that it is not in the best\r\n  interests of the children to uphold the travel restriction.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  reverse the travel restriction on Husbandâ€™s visitation.Â  In light of our\r\n  disposition, we need not address Husbandâ€™s remaining issues.Â  See Whiteside\r\n    v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340-41, 428 S.E.2d\r\n  886, 889 (1993) (appellate court need not address a remaining issue when\r\n  resolution of prior issue is dispositive).Â Â Â   \r\nREVERSED.\r\nHUFF and PIEPER,\r\n  JJ., and CURETON, AJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] Although the appointed Guardian ad Litem recommended\r\n  both parents be enjoined and restrained from bringing overnight guests with\r\n  whom he or she is having a romantic relationship when the children are present,\r\n  the judge only imposed this restriction on Husband.Â   \r\n[2] The only issue on appeal is the travel restriction imposed\r\n  on Husbandâ€™s visitation.Â   \r\n[3] Husband claims, in his reply brief, that the travel\r\n  restriction is materially distinct from the supervised visitation requested by\r\n  Wife in her complaint.Â  Husband contends the judge erred in awarding relief not\r\n  contemplated by the pleadings.Â  We find this argument is not preserved for our\r\n  review.Â  First, it was not raised to the family court judge during the trial or\r\n  in Husbandâ€™s motion to alter or amend.Â  See Staubes v. City of Folly\r\n    Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (holding that issues\r\n  must be raised and ruled upon in the trial court to be preserved for appellate\r\n  review).Â  Additionally, Husband raised the argument for the first time in his\r\n  reply brief.Â  See Crawford v.

(the Association).[1]\r\n      We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nOutdoor\r\n  Resorts RV Resort and Yacht Club (the Development) is a recreational vehicle (RV)\r\n  resort and marina located on Jenkins Island in Beaufort County.Â  From the Developmentâ€™s\r\n  inception in 1981, it has consisted of several separate areas.Â  One of these\r\n  areas is the Marina, which has 110 slips, a fuel dock, a launching ramp, a bath\r\n  house, fuel storage facilities, an access road, a marina office, and several\r\n  parking spaces.Â  The Marina is a completely separate entity from the rest of\r\n  the Development.Â  Another area is the Resort, which includes 200 lots with\r\n  parking pads for RVs (lots), swimming pools, tennis courts, a playground, a\r\n  yacht club/clubhouse building, roads and open space, a maintenance area, and\r\n  utilities, including a sewage treatment facility.Â  Many of the lots were owned\r\n  by individuals.Â  A third area is a real estate and rental management business\r\n  (Rental Office), which includes a building, check-in areas, and parking spaces.Â \r\n  Outdoor Resort R.V. Resort and Yacht Club, a South Carolina General\r\n  Partnership, developed the Resort and owned the Marina and Rental Office.Â  In\r\n  June 1981, the â€œDeclaration of Covenants and Restrictions for Outdoor Resorts,\r\n  R.V. Resort and Yacht Club and Provisions for the R.V. Resort and Yacht Club\r\n  Ownersâ€™ Association, Inc.â€Â  (Covenants) were recorded.Â  Â \r\nThe\r\n  Covenants provide Developer has the exclusive right to rent lots belonging to\r\n  the individual owners within the Resort when not occupied by the owner and his\r\n  or her guest at the scheduled rate promulgated by Developer.Â  The Covenants\r\n  further provide Developer shall retain fifty percent â€œof rental collected on\r\n  any Lotâ€ and remit the remaining fifty percent to the lot owner.Â  The\r\n  definition section of the Covenants does not contain a definition relating to\r\n  rent or rental.Â  Â Â \r\nArticle\r\n  VIII, Section 8.11 of the Covenants provides: â€œOther reasonable rules and\r\n  regulations governing use and occupancy and which do not alter or are not in\r\n  contravention of any of the foregoing provisions may be made and amended from\r\n  time to time by the Association, without the prior written consent of the\r\n  Developer . . ..â€Â  From 1981 to 1999 the Developer rented lots, splitting the\r\n  rental fee 50/50 with the owners and collecting an additional fee of $2.00 for\r\n  the use of electricity.Â  The Developer paid the electricity fee directly to the\r\n  owner of the lot (electricity charge).Â  In 1999, Dwight Blakeslee, as President\r\n  of the Association, requested an increase in rental rates.Â  First, Blakeslee\r\n  requested Developer collect an additional $1.00 per night as a â€œroad taxâ€ to\r\n  reserve for road resurfacing.Â  Next, Blakeslee requested the electricity charge\r\n  be increased $1.00 per night to $3.00 due to the increase in size and\r\n  technology of the vehicles renting lots.Â  On June 23, 1999, Developer agreed to\r\n  the Associationâ€™s proposal. \r\nOn\r\n  July 7, 1999, Blakeslee sent a letter on behalf of the Association to Linda\r\n  Higgins, the Rental Manager of the Developer, accepting Higginsâ€™ suggestion to\r\n  implement the new charges beginning September 15, 1999.Â  The letter also\r\n  requested, in the event of a sale of Developerâ€™s interest, â€œthe agreed upon\r\n  rate increase and the allocation of those funds be made known to the buyer so\r\n  that there will be no question as to the validity of the rate change.â€ \r\nOn August\r\n  31, 1999, BillyBob bought the Marina and rental management businesses, along with\r\n  real estate Developer owned within the Development, Developerâ€™s rights to rent\r\n  lots, and the Lease.Â  The electricity charge was collected and remitted to the\r\n  lot owners for a short time following BillyBobâ€™s purchase.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  October 17, 1999, BillyBob informed the Association by letter that it was\r\n  cancelling the $3 electricity charge effective October 31, 1999.Â  BillyBob wanted\r\n  to increase the nightly rental rate from $26.00 to $32.00.[2]Â \r\n    BillyBob sent a second letter the same day stating it would charge the $1.00\r\n    per night road tax retroactively from August 31, 1999, but only if the Association\r\n    would pass a resolution or amendment committing the Association to maintaining\r\n    and repairing Developerâ€™s roads in the same manner and state of repair as the\r\n    Associationâ€™s roads.\r\nThe Association\r\n  rejected BillyBobâ€™s demand to undertake maintenance and repairs of Developerâ€™s\r\n  roads and objected to BillyBobâ€™s refusal to honor the previous Developerâ€™s\r\n  commitment to collect the $3.00 electricity charge and $1.00 road tax. \r\nBillyBob\r\n  initiated its proposed changes and further initiated a telephone fee, charging\r\n  renters $2.00 for lots with telephone service and paying the owners $1.00 of\r\n  this charge.Â  In addition, BillyBob claimed a right of first refusal on lot\r\n  sales and established numerous new restrictions on the ownersâ€™ use of their\r\n  lots including restrictions on owners leaving vehicles on the lots and renting\r\n  to families with children.Â  \r\nThe Association and\r\n  several lot owners filed this action alleging, inter alia, BillyBobâ€™s\r\n  violated the Covenants by failing to collect and remit all of the charges.Â  BillyBob\r\n  counterclaimed asserting numerous violations of the Covenants including\r\n  permanent residents living on their lots in the Resort.Â  Following a bench\r\n  trial, the referee found the Covenants governed, the Association had the\r\n  authority to adopt and modify rules and regulations as long as not in contravention\r\n  of the Covenants, and BillyBob had no right to modify the Covenants or\r\n  promulgate rules in contravention thereof. Â The referee found BillyBob violated\r\n  the Covenants by failing to collect the road tax, and failing to remit all of\r\n  the money collected for electricity and telephone charges.Â  The referee also\r\n  found BillyBob violated the Covenants in numerous other manners, including\r\n  allowing marina guests to use the Associationâ€™s common areas and prohibiting guests\r\n  with children to rent waterfront lots.Â  The referee ordered an accounting to\r\n  determine sums due the Association.Â  The referee also found neither party entitled\r\n  to attorneyâ€™s fees for the issues determined to date.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  a hearing on the accounting and the remaining issues, the referee awarded the\r\n  Association $48,447.50 for the road tax fund, $145,831.50 for electricity\r\n  charges, and $1,048.50 for telephone charges.Â  Additionally, the referee awarded attorneyâ€™s fees of $52,212.50 and costs of\r\n  $16,379.05.Â  BillyBob appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis court recently addressed the standard of review\r\n  in an action to enforce restrictive covenants:\r\n\r\n  The character of an action as legal or equitable depends on the\r\n    relief sought. Compare Oâ€™Shea v. Lesser, 308 S.C. 10, 14, 416 S.E.2d 629, 631\r\n      (1992) (holding an\r\n    action for breach of restrictive covenants was at law,\r\n    because relief sought was general damages for loss of\r\n    view and invasion of privacy) [with] Kneale v. Bonds, 317 S.C.\r\n    262, 265, 452 S.E.2d 840, 841 (Ct. App. 1994) (â€œAn action to enforce restrictive covenants by injunction is\r\n    in equity.â€); see also S.C. Depâ€™t of Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville,\r\n    345 S.C. 617, 622, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302 (2001) (holding an action to enforce restrictive covenants by injunction is\r\n    an equitable action). . .. Â [If\r\n    the] action is one to enforce restrictive covenants by\r\n    injunction, it is in equity, and we may find facts in accordance with our own\r\n    view of the evidence.Â  Brenco v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 363 S.C. 136,\r\n    142, 609 S.E.2d 531, 534 (Ct. App. 2005). Â \r\n\r\nCedar Cove\r\n  Homeowners Assâ€™n v. DiPietro, 368 S.C. 254, 258, 628 S.E.2d 284, 286 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  If the\r\n  action for breach of covenants is at law, we will not disturb the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  findings unless they are unsupported by the evidence.Â  Oâ€™Shea v. Lesser,\r\n  308 S.C. 10, 14, 416 S.E.2d 629, 631 (1992).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nI.Â  Covenants\r\nBillyBob contends the referee erred in finding it was\r\n  required to collect the road tax for the benefit of the Association and to\r\n  collect and remit the full electricity and telephone charges.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œRestrictive\r\n  covenants are contractual in nature, so that the paramount rule of construction\r\n  is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the parties as determined from\r\n  the whole document.â€Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 622, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302&nbsp;(2001). â€œThe language of a\r\n  restrictive covenant is to be construed according to the plain and ordinary\r\n  meaning attributed to it at the time of execution.â€Â  Hardy v. Aiken,&nbsp;369\r\n  S.C. 160, 166, 631 S.E.2d 539, 542&nbsp;(2006). Â \r\nBillyBob contends\r\n  the charges constitute rent, which he has the exclusive right to set, and thus,\r\n  they are subject to the equal division between BillyBob and the lot owners.Â  BillyBob\r\n  relies in part on the Associationâ€™s letter discussing the changes in which they\r\n  refer to the charges as part of the increase in â€œrental rates.â€Â  However, as\r\n  the letter described, these charges would not operate as the rental rate did, because\r\n  the charges would pass directly to the lot owners instead of being subject to a\r\n  split.Â  The Covenants grant the Association the right to promulgate rules and\r\n  regulations without BillyBobâ€™s permission.Â  We find BillyBob was required to\r\n  collect the charges on behalf of the Association and therefore affirm the\r\n  refereeâ€™s findings on this issue.\r\nII.Â  Permanent Resident \r\nBillyBob\r\n  next contends the referee erred in failing to find Dwight Blakeslee, a lot\r\n  owner, was permanently residing on his lot in violation of the Covenants.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nArticle\r\n  VIII, section 8.1, of the Covenants state: â€œIt is the specific intent of this\r\n  Declaration to create and maintain a lu[x]ury resort for recreational vehicles\r\n  and to prohibit permanent or semi-permanent structures as well as any structure\r\n  or vehicle which is used as, or designed for use as, permanent living quarters\r\n  on any Lot.â€Â  The section further provides: â€œLot Owners . . . are prohibited\r\n  from erecting or placing on any Lot any permanent or semi-permanent structure\r\n  or any vehicle which is designed as permanent living quarters . . ..â€ \r\nBillyBob\r\n  contends Blakesleeâ€™s claim of the homestead exemption for tax purposes\r\n  indicates Blakeslee is a permanent resident.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  12-37-250(A)(1)(Supp. 2006) (providing, for certain classes of people: â€œThe\r\n  first fifty thousand dollars of the fair market value of the dwelling place of\r\n  a person is exempt from county, municipal, school, and special assessment real\r\n  estate property taxes. . ..â€).Â  â€œDwelling placeâ€ is defined as the â€œpermanent\r\n  home and legal residence of the applicant.â€Â  Id. at Â§12-37-250(A)(5).Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  there is other evidence in the record that Blakeslee is not a permanent\r\n  resident.Â  Jean Littell, a long time owner and board member, testified\r\n  Blakeslee was not a permanent resident.Â  She testified he travels between three\r\n  and six months out of the year and when he travels he usually takes his RV with\r\n  him.Â  BillyBob did not present any testimony that Blakeslee actually\r\n  permanently resided on his lot.Â  We find no reversible error in the refereeâ€™s\r\n  finding that Blakeslee was not a permanent resident.\r\nIII.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nBillyBob\r\n  maintains the referee erred in awarding fees and costs to the Association\r\n  instead of BillyBob.Â Â  We agree the Association was not entitled to attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees.\r\nâ€œAn\r\n  award of attorneysâ€™ fees and costs is a discretionary matter not to be\r\n  overturned absent abuse by the trial court.â€ Â Donahue v. Donahue,\r\n  299 S.C. 353, 365, 384 S.E.2d 741, 748 (1989).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion\r\n  occurs when the decision is controlled by some error of law or is based on\r\n  findings of fact that are without evidentiary support.â€Â  Degenhart v. Burriss, 360 S.C. 497, 500, 602 S.E.2d 96,\r\n  97 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Generally, attorneyâ€™s fees are\r\n  not recoverable unless authorized by contract or statute.Â  Baron Data Sys.,\r\n    Inc. v. Loter, 297 S.C. 382, 383, 377 S.E.2d 296, 297 (1989).Â  â€œRestrictive\r\n  covenants are contractual in nature.â€Â  Hoffman v. Cohen, 262 S.C. 71,\r\n  75, 202 S.E.2d 363, 365 (1974).\r\nThe Covenants and the Lease\r\n  allow for the recovery of attorneyâ€™s fees for the prevailing party.Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court has defined a\r\n  prevailing party as â€œone who successfully prosecutes the action or successfully\r\n  defends against it, prevailing on the main issue, even though not to the extent\r\n  of the original contention [and] is the one in whose favor the decision or\r\n  verdict is rendered and judgment entered.â€ Â Heath\r\n    v. County of Aiken, 302 S.C. 178, 182-83, 394 S.E.2d 709, 711 (1990)\r\n  (alteration in original).\r\nIn its\r\n  first order, the referee found because each of the parties had prevailed on\r\n  some issues, neither was entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The referee stated: â€œI\r\n  will consider attorney[â€™]s fees on the remainder of the case after a hearing on\r\n  the merits of the remaining issues.â€Â  The remaining issues involved an\r\n  accounting and allegations by the Association of fraud by BillyBob.Â  In the\r\n  final hearing, the referee found no fraud by BillyBob but awarded attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees to the Association of $52,212.50 and costs of $16,379.05.Â  Furthermore, the referee failed to make specific findings in support of the\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  â€œOur case law and\r\n  court rules make clear that when a contract or statute authorizes an award of\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees, the trial court must make specific findings of fact on the\r\n  record for each of the required factors to be considered.â€Â  Griffith v. Griffith, 332 S.C. 630, 646, 506 S.E.2d 526, 534-35 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we reverse the award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  \r\nBillyBob also\r\n  contends it should have received attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  BillyBob likewise prevailed\r\n  only on some of the issues and the record does not support an award of\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Accordingly, the referee did not err in failing to award BillyBob\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, the order of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART\r\n  AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\nANDERSON, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Several individual members of the Association\r\n  are named plaintiffs.Â  We refer to all plaintiffs collectively as the\r\n  Association.\r\n[2] At the time of purchase, the rental rate was\r\n  $26.00.Â  Owners received one-half of the rental, or $13.00, plus the $3.00\r\n  electricity charge for a total of $16.00 per night.Â  Developer received\r\n  one-half of the rental, or $13.00 per night.Â  Under BillyBobâ€™s proposed change,\r\n  the rental rate was first $29, then $32, and both owners and BillyBob would\r\n  receive $16.00 per rental night. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-557","title":"State v.

Law appeals the probation courtâ€™s order holding her in contempt.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn September 15, 2005, Law was brought before the court for a\r\n  probation revocation hearing.Â  Law admitted she had violated the terms of her\r\n  probation.Â  The probation court issued a written order that found Law had\r\n  violated the conditions of her probation, revoked Lawâ€™s probation, and re-instated\r\n  her suspended five year sentence.Â  Following sentencing, a probation agent\r\n  presented a Form 9 (revocation order) to Law for her signature.Â  Law signed the\r\n  revocation order â€œKiss My Assâ€ and instructed the probation agent to give the\r\n  revocation order to the judge.Â  The probation agent complied with Lawâ€™s\r\n  instruction, and the judge scheduled a contempt hearing for later that day. Â Â Â \r\nFollowing the hearing, the judge prepared a written order which\r\n  stated that Law had signed the revocation order â€œKiss My Assâ€ and requested the\r\n  revocation order be taken to the judge and that her request had been fulfilled.Â \r\n  The judgeâ€™s order also stated that Law had been held in contempt for her\r\n  conduct.Â  Â Law appeals the probation courtâ€™s order holding her in contempt.Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nAll\r\n  courts have inherent power to punish for contempt. Curlee v. Howle, 277\r\n  S.C. 377, 382, 287 S.E.2d 915, 918 (1982). Â This power is essential to the\r\n  preservation of order in judicial proceedings and the due administration of\r\n  justice. Â Id.Â  The â€œdetermination\r\n  of contempt ordinarily resides in the sound discretion of the trial judge.â€ Â State\r\n    v. Bevilacqua, 316 S.C. 122, 129, 447 S.E.2d 213, 217 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  An\r\n  appellate court â€œshould reverse a decision regarding contempt only if it is\r\n  without evidentiary support or the trial judge has abused his discretion.â€ Â Durlach\r\n    v. Durlach, 359 S.C. 64, 70, 596 S.E.2d 908, 912 (2004) (internal quotation\r\n  and citation omitted).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs either when the court is\r\n  controlled by some error of law or where the order, based upon findings of\r\n  fact, lacks evidentiary support.â€ Â Townsend v. Townsend, 356 S.C. 70, 73,\r\n  587 S.E.2d 118, 119 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nLaw argues the probation court erred by holding her â€œin contempt,\r\n  and imposing a ninety day additional sentence, where the record fails to\r\n  disclose the nature of the alleged contemptuous conduct, and whether it\r\n  allegedly occurred in the presence of the court or outside the presence of the\r\n  court.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nClearly, the alleged contemptuous conduct was signing the\r\n  revocation order â€œKiss My Assâ€ and instructing that the revocation order,\r\n  signed in that manner, be given to the judge.Â  The revocation order is included\r\n  in the record and is signed â€œKiss My Assâ€.Â  During the contempt hearing, the judge\r\n  stated the probation agent brought the revocation order back to her.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the record clearly shows Lawâ€™s contemptuous conduct.  \r\nWe now turn to Lawâ€™s argument that the record fails to disclose\r\n  whether the contemptuous conduct occurred in the presence of the court or\r\n  outside the presence of the court.Â  â€œSouth Carolina courts have always taken a liberal and expansive view of the â€˜presenceâ€™ and\r\n  â€˜courtâ€™ requirements. This Stateâ€™s courts have held the â€˜presence of the courtâ€™\r\n  extends beyond the mere physical presence of the judge or the courtroom to\r\n  encompass all elements of the system.â€ State v.

Phillips, of Anderson, for \r\n\t\t\t\tAppellants.\r\n\t\t\t\tDottie C. Ingram, of Anderson, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Nancy\r\n  N. (Mother) and Don N. (Stepfather) appeal an order of the family court which,\r\n  among other things, refused to allow the minor children K.G. and J.G. to return\r\n  to Motherâ€™s custody and permanently restrained Stepfather from contact with either\r\n  child.Â  Specifically, Mother and Stepfather argue the family court erred in\r\n  admitting J.G.â€™s out-of-court statements alleging sexual abuse by Stepfather. Â We\r\n  affirm.[1]  \r\nFACTS\r\nK.G. and J.G. were\r\n  placed in emergency protective custody on August 18, 2005 when the children\r\n  were ages ten and eight, respectively.Â  When the children were removed from\r\n  their home, J.G had a black eye and bruises on his neck.Â  Stepfather told law\r\n  enforcement that he had lifted J.G. by his neck.Â  Â At the probable cause\r\n  hearing, the family court found Stepfather had physically abused J.G. and\r\n  Mother failed to protect her children from abuse and neglect. Â DSS was given\r\n  legal custody of the children, and they were placed in foster care.Â  Soon after\r\n  J.G.â€™s placement, he attempted a sexual act on another child in the foster\r\n  home. Â J.G.â€™s disruptive behavior resulted in his relocation in seven foster\r\n  care settings before being transferred to York Place, a residential treatment\r\n  facility for emotionally disturbed children.  \r\nPrior\r\n  to the merits hearing, DSS gave Mother and Stepfather notice of its intent to\r\n  present testimony of J.G.â€™s out-of-court statements alleging sexual abuse by\r\n  Stepfather.Â  At the hearing, Mother and Stepfather objected to these\r\n  out-of-court statements, but the family court allowed them pursuant to section\r\n  19-1-180 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006).\r\nNicholas\r\n  Godfrey, J.G.â€™s former case manager, testified that he had asked J.G. about his\r\n  sexual behavior toward the other child in foster care. Â J.G. said Stepfather\r\n  had engaged in the same sexual behavior with him.Â  Godfrey found the report to\r\n  be credible because J.G. cried uncontrollably and appeared traumatized as they\r\n  discussed the alleged sexual abuse by Stepfather. Â Trinity Sands, a forensic\r\n  interviewer, testified she conducted an assessment of J.G. the week following\r\n  J.Gâ€™s disclosure to Godfrey. Â Sands considered J.G.â€™s statements alleging\r\n  sexual abuse by Stepfather to be credible based on the level of detail J.G.\r\n  provided.\r\nAfter\r\n  his transfer to York Place in February 2006, J.G. received daily behavior\r\n  management therapy sessions with licensed social worker, Catherine Jones. Â Jones\r\n  stated J.G. initially exhibited aggressive behaviors with adults, sexual acting\r\n  out with children, and self-harming behaviors.Â  However, after a year of\r\n  intensive individual counseling, group therapy, and medication for a mood\r\n  disorder, J.G. had progressed greatly. Â He had recently returned to public\r\n  school and would soon be moved to a therapeutic foster home. Â According to Jones,\r\n  J.G. would be severely traumatized if required to testify in any setting about\r\n  the alleged sexual abuse, and he could potentially regress.Â  Additionally, she\r\n  testified that J.G. associated everything about the court with talking to a\r\n  judge, and he had told her â€œhe did not want to talk to the Judge.â€  \r\nDSS\r\n  foster care manager, Dani Lawson, testified that Mother still did not believe\r\n  Stepfather had sexually abused J.G. Â Although Mother stated she believed\r\n  something had happened to J.G., she did not think Stepfather had done anything\r\n  inappropriate.Â  Stepfather, who had moved out of the home two weeks\r\n  prior to the hearing, attended but did not testify.  \r\nFollowing\r\n  the review hearing, the family court ordered Stepfather to have no further\r\n  contact with K.G. or J.G. It required DSS to enter Stepfatherâ€™s name into the Central\r\n  Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect based on the courtâ€™s finding that he had\r\n  sexually abused J.G.[2] Â DSS was ordered to retain custody of J.G. and to transfer custody of K.G. to her biological father, allowing Mother\r\n  supervised visitation with K.G.Â  Stepfather\r\n  and Mother appeal the order, contending the court erred in admitting J.G.â€™s out-of-court\r\n  statements of his alleged sexual abuse by Stepfather.  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œOn appeal from an\r\n  order of the family court, the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to find facts\r\n  in accordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Calcutt\r\n    v. Calcutt, 282 S.C. 565, 568, 320 S.E.2d 55, 57 (Ct. App. 1984). Â Even\r\n  under this broad scope of review, the appellant must convince us that the trial\r\n  judge erred. Â Id.Â   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMother and\r\n  Stepfather argue the family court erred by allowing the admission of J.G.â€™s out-of-court\r\n  statements to Godfrey and Sands. Â We disagree. Â \r\nTestimony\r\n  of the out-of-court statements of a child under the age of twelve will be\r\n  admitted in a family court proceeding where abuse or neglect is alleged if the\r\n  court finds the child is unavailable to testify for one of five statutory\r\n  reasons, and the childâ€™s out-of-court statements possess particularized\r\n  guarantees of trustworthiness.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 19-1-180 (Supp. 2006).Â  The\r\n  first requirement for admission of J.G.â€™s out-of-court statements was clearly\r\n  met.Â  Here, J.G. was eight years old in 2005 when he told Godfrey and Sands of\r\n  his alleged sexual abuse by Stepfather and was age ten at the time they\r\n  testified to his statements. Â \r\nAs\r\n  to the requirement of unavailability, Mother and Stepfather contend the court\r\n  erred by relying on Jonesâ€™s testimony in finding that J.G. was unavailable to\r\n  testify. Â We disagree.Â   \r\nA\r\n  child is unavailable to testify when there is a substantial likelihood he will suffer\r\n  severe emotional trauma from testifying at the proceeding, on videotape, or on\r\n  closed-circuit television. Â S.C. Code Ann Â§ 19-1-180(B)(2)(a)(v). Â Jones, who\r\n  testified regarding the trauma J.G. would suffer if required to testify to the\r\n  alleged abuse, is a licensed social worker and led individual and group therapy\r\n  sessions that included J.G. for over a year.Â  She testified to the progress J.G.\r\n  made during his year in residential treatment and expressed the opinion that\r\n  requiring him to discuss his sexual abuse would cause severe trauma and could\r\n  cause him to regress.Â  Jonesâ€™s opinion is bolstered by Godfreyâ€™s testimony regarding\r\n  J.G.â€™s severe reaction when he disclosed the alleged abuse to Godfrey in\r\n  October 2005. Â Additionally, guardian ad litem, Robert Higgins, agreed that J.G.\r\n  should not be required to testify personally or by videotape.Â  We find the\r\n  evidence presented at the hearing was sufficient to support the family courtâ€™s\r\n  finding that J.G. was unavailable to testify in any manner because there was a\r\n  substantial likelihood that he would suffer severe emotional trauma.  \r\nIn\r\n  order to be admissible, South Carolina Code Section 19-1-180(B)(2)(b) requires a\r\n  childâ€™s out-of-court statement to possess particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\r\n  Â Here, the court went to great lengths to support its finding of these\r\n  guarantees by considering (1) J.G.â€™s personal knowledge of the events he described\r\n  to Sands and Godfrey; (2) J.G.â€™s age and maturity at the time he reported the\r\n  sexual abuse to the witnesses; (3) the credibility of Sandsâ€™s and Godfreyâ€™s\r\n  testimony; (4) the absence of a motive for J.G. to falsify or distort the\r\n  information he reported to Sands and Godfrey; (5) the internal consistency and â€œthe\r\n  ring of veracityâ€ J.G.â€™s statements possessed; and (6) the fact that Stepfather\r\n  had the opportunity to commit the alleged acts of sexual abuse.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 19-1-180(D)(1)-(10) (listing factors a court may consider in\r\n  determining whether a childâ€™s out-of-court statement contains particularized\r\n  guarantees of trustworthiness). Â The family court found J.G.â€™s out-of-court statements\r\n  to be trustworthy and â€œthis Court will give great deference to the family\r\n  courtâ€™s determination on the issue of trustworthiness.â€ Â Richland Co. Dept.\r\n    of Soc. Servs. v. Earles, 330 S.C. 24, 32, 496 S.E.2d 864, 868 (1998). Â We\r\n  find no error in the family courtâ€™s determination that J.G.â€™s out-of-court\r\n  statements possessed particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, the order of the family court is  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON,\r\n  SHORT and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Stepfather was already listed in the South Carolina\r\n  Directory of Sex Offenders based on his 1997 conviction for committing a lewd\r\n  act on a child under the age of sixteen.Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
