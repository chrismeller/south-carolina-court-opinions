Bishop, Jr., of Moncks Corner,\r\n          for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Francis\r\n  Salerno appeals the circuit court's order that affirmed the probate court's\r\n  grant of summary judgment in favor of Harry Wilbur's estate (Estate). Salerno\r\n  argues the Estate failed to rebut the presumption of undue influence that arose\r\n  out of the fiduciary relationship between Harry Wilbur and Fonza Alberta\r\n  Wiggins created by Wilbur's power of attorney.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nGenerally, a presumption\r\n  exists that a will was executed without undue influence.Â  Hembree v. Estate\r\n    of Hembree, 311 S.C. 192, 194, 428 S.E.2d 3, 4&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1993).Â  Thus,\r\n  a person contesting a will has the burden of proving undue influence in order\r\n  to invalidate a will.Â  Id.Â  &quot;Undue influence must be shown by\r\n  unmistakable and convincing evidence . . . .&quot;Â  Russell v. Wachovia\r\n    Bank, N.A.,&nbsp; 353 S.C. 208, 217, 578 S.E.2d 329, 333&nbsp;( 2003).Â  &quot;The\r\n  evidence must show that the free will of the testator was taken over by someone\r\n  acting on testator's behalf.&quot;Â  Id.Â Â  Undue influence is also\r\n  demonstrated where the testator does not make decisions by his own judgment or\r\n  volition, but rather under the direction of the influencer.Â  Id.Â \r\n  However, &quot;[t]he mere existence of influence is not enough to void a will;&quot;\r\n  instead, the influence &quot;must destroy free agency and amount to force and\r\n  coercion.&quot;Â  Hembree, 311 S.C. at 196, 428 S.E.2d at 5.Â Â  \r\nThe existence of a fiduciary\r\n  relationship creates a presumption of undue influence.Â  Hairston v. McMillan,\r\n  387 S.C. 439, 447, 692 S.E.2d 549, 553&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2010).Â Â  &quot;A\r\n  confidential or fiduciary relationship exists when one imposes a special\r\n  confidence in another, so that the latter, in equity and good conscience, is\r\n  bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the interest of the one\r\n  imposing the confidence.&quot;Â  In re Estate of\r\n    Anderson, 381 S.C. 568, 574, 674\r\n  S.E.2d 176, 180 (Ct. App. 2009) (quotation marks and citations omitted).Â  A\r\n  power of attorney also creates a fiduciary relationship.Â  Id.Â  Thus, if\r\n  a fiduciary relationship exists, &quot;the proponents of the will must offer\r\n  rebuttal evidence&quot; of the presumption of undue influence.Â  Hairston,\r\n  387 S.C. at 447, 692 S.E.2d at 553.Â  However, the burden does not shift to the\r\n  proponents of the will to &quot;affirmatively disprove the existence of undue\r\n  influence.&quot;Â  Id. Â Instead, the burden of proof to invalidate the\r\n  will remains with the contestants of the will.Â  Id.\r\nWe find the circuit court\r\n  properly affirmed the probate court's decision granting summary judgment in\r\n  favor of the Estate because no genuine issue of material fact existed\r\n  concerning the undue influence claim.Â  See Rule 56(c), SCRCP (providing\r\n  summary judgment is appropriate when &quot;no\r\n  genuine issue as to any material fact&quot; exists and &quot;the moving party\r\n  is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law&quot;).Â  The Estate presented sufficient evidence to rebut the\r\n  presumption of undue influence. Although a fiduciary relationship existed\r\n  between Wilbur and Wiggins due to Wilbur's power of attorney, no evidence\r\n  existed showing it was ever utilized.Â  See In re Estate of Anderson, 381 S.C. at 574, 674 S.E.2d at 180 (finding the Estate\r\n  properly rebutted a presumption of undue influence despite the existence of a\r\n  fiduciary relationship created by a power of attorney because no evidence\r\n  existed showing that the power was ever utilized).Â Â  Here, Wiggins testified\r\n  she did not know when Wilbur executed the power of attorney.Â  Wiggins also\r\n  explained that Wilbur did not use the power of attorney when he transferred the\r\n  title of a 2006 Kia Optima into her name.Â Â  Furthermore, no additional evidence\r\n  was presented to indicate Wiggins ever utilized the power of attorney.\r\nMoreover,\r\n  no evidence existed indicating Wilbur did not have the opportunity to dispose\r\n  of his property as he wanted.Â  Wiggins acknowledged she took Wilbur to his\r\n  lawyer's office to revise his will in 2005, but she explained she did not\r\n  participate in the revision of Wilbur's will.Â  Wiggins also explained she did\r\n  not know where Wilbur got his money.Â  Additionally, Salerno stated he believed\r\n  Wilbur was in good health and capable of getting around by himself before his\r\n  death and Wilbur never contacted him concerning a need to get away from\r\n  Wiggins. Â Salerno also acknowledged the only information he had available\r\n  concerning his undue influence claim is that his relationship with Wilbur\r\n  declined after Wiggins began dating him.Â  He also admitted Wilbur had prepared\r\n  a number of wills since the September 1998 will.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, PIEPER, and LOCKEMY,\r\n  JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-424","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W.\r\n          Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General Mark Farthing, all of Columbia; Solicitor\r\n          Scarlett A. Wilson, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Donovan\r\n  Terrell Murray appeals his conviction and sentence for possession with intent\r\n  to distribute cocaine and possession with intent to distribute cocaine within\r\n  the proximity of a school, arguing the trial court erred in admitting (1) his\r\n  statements in violation of his Miranda[1] rights and (2) evidence and testimony regarding his possession of prescription\r\n  drugs without a prescription in violation of Rules 403 and 404(b), SCRE.Â  We affirm.[2]\r\n1. Â The trial court properly admitted Murray's\r\n  three statements regarding the prescription pills. Â Murray was not in custody\r\n  at the time of his first two statements, when he made statements regarding the\r\n  entry of officers into the hotel room or when he spoke with Officer Patricia Jourdan\r\n  concerning his lack of prescription for the pills. Â Therefore, the officers\r\n  were not required to administer Miranda warnings. Â See State v. Easler, 327 S.C. 121,\r\n  127, 489 S.E.2d 617, 621 (1997) (holding Miranda rights are required\r\n  only in situations involving custodial interrogation, in which a suspect is\r\n  taken into custody or deprived of his freedom in any significant way); see\r\n    also Miranda, 384 U.S. at 477-78 (&quot;General on-the-scene questioning as to\r\n  facts surrounding a crime or other general questioning of citizens in the\r\n  fact-finding process is not affected by our holding.&quot;); State v. Whitner, 380 S.C. 513, 518, 670\r\n  S.E.2d 655, 658 (Ct. App. 2008) (holding custodial interrogation requires both\r\n  custody and interrogation initiated by the law).Â  \r\nAdditionally, Murray's third\r\n  statement, made after being handcuffed, was admissible because his statements\r\n  were voluntary and not in response to interrogation. Â See State v. Middleton, 288 S.C. 21, 25, 339 S.E.2d 692, 694 (1986)\r\n  (&quot;In order to secure the admission of a defendant's statement, the State\r\n  must affirmatively show the statement was voluntary and taken in\r\n  compliance with Miranda.&quot;) (emphasis added); State v. Kennedy, 325\r\n  S.C. 295, 307, 479 S.E.2d 838, 844 (Ct. App. 1996) (holding an oral admission\r\n  not in response to any interrogation is voluntary); State v. Sprouse,\r\n  325 S.C. 275, 282, 478 S.E.2d 871, 875 (Ct. App. 1996) (finding the requirement\r\n  for Miranda warnings do not apply to voluntary statements that are not\r\n  part of interrogation).\r\n2. Â The trial\r\n  court did not err in admitting evidence and testimony regarding Murray's\r\n  possession of prescription drugs without a prescription in violation of Rules 403\r\n  and 404(b), SCRE. Â See State v.\r\n    Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 121, 551 S.E.2d 240, 244&nbsp;(2001) (&quot;The\r\n  admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial\r\n  [court], whose decision will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion.&quot;); Anderson\r\n    v.

Weston,\r\n  367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006).Â  If any direct evidence or\r\n  substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the\r\n  accused, an appellate court must find the case was properly submitted to the\r\n  jury.Â  Id. at 292-93, 625 S.E.2d at 648.Â  The circuit court may not\r\n  consider the weight of the evidence.Â  Id. at 292, 625 S.E.2d at 648.Â  &quot;Attempt\r\n  crimes are generally ones of specific intent such that the act constituting the\r\n  attempt must be done with the intent to commit that particular crime.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Nesbitt, 346 S.C. 226, 231, 550 S.E.2d 864, 866 (Ct. App. 2001).

Applegate, of Charleston, for\r\n          Respondent/Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Port City Limited Partnership and Ziff Properties,\r\n  Inc. (collectively Appellants) appeal the circuit court's judgment in favor of\r\n  the City of Charleston (the City) as to Appellants' claim for past-due\r\n  &quot;common expenses&quot; under two leases between the parties.Â  The City\r\n  cross-appeals the circuit court's denial of its request for attorney's fees.Â \r\n  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe City entered a ten-year\r\n  lease for space in the Port City Center to house the South Carolina Automatic\r\n  Ticketing Office (SCAT) beginning in 1994.Â  The lease was extended for an\r\n  additional twenty-six months.Â  The City also leased space in the Port City\r\n  Center for a ten-year term beginning in 1996 to house its Archives division.Â \r\n  The property was managed by Ziff Properties.Â  The terms of both leases were\r\n  substantially similar.Â  The SCAT lease provided:\r\n\r\n  3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating\r\n    Cost Adjustment and Additional Rents:\r\n  (A) Tenant's\r\n    Pro Rata Share:Â  The Tenant's share of common expenses which are to be paid\r\n    as Additional Rents shall be equal to three and one-half (3.5%)[1] percent (&quot;Tenant's Pro Rata Share&quot;).\r\n  (B) Solid\r\n    Waste User Fee:Â  The Tenant shall pay the Tenant's Pro Rata Share of any\r\n    solid waste user fees assessed against the Building and its common property on\r\n    a monthly basis as invoiced by the Landlord.Â  The monthly fee for the first\r\n    year is fo[]rty dollars ($40.00) per month,[2] and will be adjusted and reconciled each year with the tenant[']s actual pro\r\n    rata expenses based on tenant occupancy.Â  \r\n\r\nThe City paid its monthly\r\n  base rent plus pro rata share of the solid waste user fee.Â  The City also paid\r\n  monthly fees for employee parking, visitor parking, and a mailbox.Â  \r\nIn March 2005, Port City\r\n  decided to sell the building to Jupiter Realty.Â  As new owners, Jupiter\r\n  performed an audit of the current leases and informed Ziff it was entitled to\r\n  additional payments from the City under the terms of the two leases.Â  In\r\n  response, Ziff sent letters to the City stating the City was required to pay\r\n  its back due pro rata share of &quot;common expenses.&quot;Â  The City refused\r\n  payment, and Appellants brought this lawsuit in May 2005, seeking the past due\r\n  amounts.Â  \r\nAt trial, Timothy Walter,\r\n  Ziff's chief executive officer, testified he did not negotiate the leases at\r\n  issue, and that the term &quot;common expenses&quot; was not defined therein.Â \r\n  However, he testified the City owed, under the leases, its pro rata share of\r\n  taxes, insurance, electricity, water and sewer, gas and fuel, landscaping,\r\n  interior plant maintenance, general repairs and maintenance, pest control,\r\n  waste disposal, elevator maintenance, security, and other building services[3] in addition to the solid waste user fee and parking fees.Â  Walter admitted those\r\n  charges were not assessed to the City until 2005 but testified that was simply an\r\n  accounting oversight.Â  Upon cross-examination, the City introduced a copy of a\r\n  fax sent in 1997 from Ziff to Daniel Maloney, the City's representative in the\r\n  lease negotiations.Â  The document was a &quot;lease report&quot; containing the\r\n  notation &quot;TI/CAM â€“ none.&quot;Â  Walter testified this would have indicated\r\n  to the recipient that no taxes, insurance, or common area maintenance fees were\r\n  due.Â  At the close of Appellants' case, the circuit court granted partial\r\n  summary judgment in the City's favor, ruling that claims for monies due prior\r\n  to May 2002, were barred by the statute of limitations.Â Â Â  \r\nThe trial continued as to the\r\n  remaining claims, and Colleen Carducci, director of real estate management for\r\n  the City, testified she was not directly involved with the negotiation of the\r\n  leases at issue.Â  However, she indicated it was her expectation based on the\r\n  lease, billing history, and conversations with Ziff that &quot;the rent\r\n  included all of the services that were being provided at the building.&quot;Â  The\r\n  City's expert, Thomas Hartnett, testified it was common in the realty business\r\n  for landlords to charge operational costs to tenants that could include\r\n  management fees, taxes, and insurance.Â  Hartnett further testified it was the\r\n  custom in commercial realty to explicitly define any expenses outside the base\r\n  rent that a tenant was obligated to pay.Â  He indicated the term &quot;common\r\n  expenses&quot; was not defined in the two leases between the City and Appellants\r\n  and it was not a term typically found in commercial leases.Â  Â Â \r\nThe circuit court held the\r\n  lease was ambiguous for indefiniteness of expression because the term &quot;common\r\n  expenses&quot; was undefined.Â  The circuit court concluded the parties' course\r\n  of conduct in the years between the signing of the leases and the filing of the\r\n  lawsuit &quot;was conclusive&quot; of their intent pursuant to Kitchens v. Lee, 221\r\n  S.C. 59, 69 S.E.2d 67 (1952)[4].Â \r\n  Because the City paid its rent plus the additional solid-waste user fee, and\r\n  that was accepted by Appellants, those actions established what &quot;common\r\n  expenses&quot; meant under the leases, and the City did not owe any additional\r\n  funds to Appellants.Â  The circuit court denied the City's request for\r\n  attorney's fees under the contract.Â  \r\nAppellants filed a motion for\r\n  reconsideration regarding the past-due amounts.Â  Likewise, the City filed a\r\n  motion for reconsideration with respect to the denial of attorney's fees.Â  Both\r\n  motions were denied, and this appeal and cross-appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Statute\r\n  of Limitations\r\nAppellants contend the\r\n  circuit court erred in finding the statute of limitations barred their claims\r\n  prior to May 2002, because the breach of contract did not occur until Ziff\r\n  requested payment for the past-due common expenses and the City refused to pay\r\n  in 2005.Â  We disagree.\r\nÂ  &quot;Statutes\r\n  of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they\r\n  stimulate activity, punish negligence, and promote repose by giving security and\r\n  stability to human affairs.&quot;Â  Moates v. Babb, 322 S.C. 172, 176,\r\n  470 S.E.2d 402, 404 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The statute of limitations for actions\r\n  pursuant to contract or statute is three years.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(1)-(2)\r\n  (2005) (stating the statute of limitations for actions based upon contract or\r\n  upon liability created by statute is three\r\n  years).Â  &quot;The limitations period begins to run when a party knows or\r\n  should know, through the exercise of due diligence, that a cause of action\r\n  might exist.&quot;Â  Anonymous Taxpayer v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 377\r\n  S.C. 425, 439, 661 S.E.2d 73, 80 (2008);Â  see also Epstein\r\n    v. Brown, 363 S.C. 372, 376, 610 S.E.2d 816, 818 (2005) (&quot;Under the\r\n    discovery rule, the statute of limitations begins to run from the date the\r\n  injured party either knows or should know, by the exercise of reasonable\r\n  diligence, that a cause of action exists for the wrongful conduct.&quot;).\r\nAppellants\r\n  contend the &quot;common expenses&quot; did not have a due date under the\r\n  leases so they were arguably not due to be paid until Ziff demanded payment\r\n  from the City in 2005.Â  Under Appellants' theory, a landlord could assess past-due\r\n  common expenses at any point in the future without fear the statute of\r\n  limitations would bar a claim.Â  Such an interpretation would severely undermine\r\n  the purpose of statutes of limitation.Â  Walter testified common expenses under\r\n  the lease should have been billed annually.Â Â  Appellants could have discovered\r\n  through their own records and the exercise of due diligence the City was not\r\n  being billed for additional fees such as taxes and insurance.Â  Therefore, the\r\n  circuit court did not err in granting summary judgment in the City's favor with\r\n  respect to claims for &quot;common expenses&quot; prior to May 2002. \r\nII.&nbsp; Common\r\n  Expenses Under the Lease\r\nAppellants argue the circuit\r\n  court erred in finding the term &quot;common expenses&quot; was ambiguous.Â \r\n  They further contend that if the leases were ambiguous, the circuit court erred\r\n  in not requiring the City to pay anything as past-due common expenses.Â  \r\nThe circuit court\r\n  determined that the phrase &quot;common expenses&quot; is ambiguous.&nbsp;\r\n  While we do not agree that the term itself is ambiguous, we do agree that the\r\n  provision in the lease for the sharing of common expenses as &quot;Additional\r\n  Rents&quot; is not capable of legal construction by the court.Â  Therefore, the\r\n  circuit court was correct to consider the prior performance of the parties\r\n  under the contract in order to determine their intent.&nbsp; See Jordan\r\n    v. Sec. Grp., Inc., 311 S.C. 227, 230, 428 S.E.2d 705, 707 (1993) (&quot;Where the language of a contract is plain and capable of\r\n      legal construction, that language alone determines the instrument's force\r\n  and effect. . . . Resort to construction by a party is only done when\r\n  the contract is ambiguous or there is doubt as to its intended meaning.&quot;)\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  \r\nWe disagree, however, with\r\n  the circuit court's conclusion that prior performance was conclusive as to the\r\n  parties' intent.&nbsp; Rather, the parties' prior conduct is merely one of the\r\n  factors the fact finder considers in determining their intent entering the\r\n  contract.&nbsp; See Langston v. Niles, 265 S.C. 445, 458, 219 S.E.2d 829, 834 (1975) (&quot;The\r\n  conduct of the parties is entitled to great weight in interpreting an ambiguous\r\n  contract.&quot;).Â  The court should also consider the testimony and evidence\r\n  adduced by the parties to the contract as well as the common usage of terms in\r\n  the industry.Â  See 32A C.J.S. Evidence Â§ 1507 (2008) (&quot;Evidence of the practical construction given to an\r\n  instrument of writing by the parties thereto may be admissible to explain its\r\n  meaning, when explanation is necessary.&quot;); Time Warner Cable v. Condo\r\n    Servs., Inc., 381 S.C. 275, 285, 672 S.E.2d 816, 820-21 (Ct. App. 2009)\r\n  (stating an unexpressed term may be inferred from the language of the contract\r\n  or by examining the facts and circumstances surrounding the bargain, or by\r\n  proving a general custom and usage of including certain terms as part of\r\n  similar contracts).\r\nBecause the circuit\r\n  court relied exclusively on the prior performance of the parties and did not\r\n  consider other indicia of intent, such as the common usage of the terms in the\r\n  industry, testimony of witnesses, and documentary evidence, the circuit court\r\n  committed an error of law.&nbsp; Therefore, we reverse the decision of the\r\n  circuit court and remand for a new trial.&nbsp; On remand, the circuit court\r\n  should consider all evidence submitted by the parties relating to their intent\r\n  in entering the lease agreement.&nbsp; \r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attorney's\r\n  Fees\r\nThe City claims the circuit\r\n  court erred in denying its request for attorney's fees pursuant to the leases,\r\n  which indicated the prevailing party shall be paid attorney's fees.Â  We reverse\r\n  and remand.\r\n&quot;The general\r\n  rule is that attorney's fees are not recoverable unless authorized by contract\r\n  or statute.&quot;Â  Blumberg v. Nealco, Inc.,Â  310 S.C. 492, 493, 427\r\n  S.E.2d 659, 660 (1993).Â  &quot;When there is a contract, the award of\r\n  attorney's fees is left to the discretion of the trial judge and will not be\r\n  disturbed unless an abuse of discretion is shown.&quot;Â  Id.Â  When\r\n  attorney's fees are requested and authorized by contract or statute, the court\r\n  should make specific findings of fact regarding certain factors including (1) the\r\n  nature, extent, and difficulty of the legal services rendered; (2) the time and\r\n  labor devoted to the case; (3) the professional standing of counsel; (4) the contingency\r\n  of compensation; (5) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar\r\n  services; and (6) the beneficial results obtained. Â Id., 310 at 494, 427\r\n  S.E.2d at 660-61.\r\nIn this case,\r\n  both leases provided:\r\n\r\n  10.6Â Â  Attorney's Fees:Â  In case suit shall be brought for\r\n    an unlawful detainer of the Leased Premises, for the recovery of any rent due\r\n    under the provision of the Lease, or because of the breach of any other\r\n    covenant herein contained on the part of Tenant to be kept and performed, Tenant\r\n      shall pay to Landlord all reasonable attorney's fees, in the event Landlord\r\n      prevails in said litigation.Â  In the event Tenant shall bring suit for breach\r\n      of Landlord's covenant herein contained or shall prevail in a suit brought by\r\n      Landlord as herein provided, Landlord shall pay Tenant all reasonable\r\n      attorney's fees. \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nThe circuit court\r\n  &quot;decline[d] to award attorney's fees&quot; in a Form 4 order and failed to\r\n  address the issue of attorney's fees at all in the formal order that followed.Â \r\n  Likewise, the circuit court summarily denied the City's motion to alter or\r\n  amend the judgment regarding the denial of attorney's fees to it under the\r\n  leases as the prevailing party.Â  \r\nThe leases\r\n  clearly call for the payment of reasonable attorney's fees to the prevailing\r\n  party.Â  While the court is given discretion to determine the amount of\r\n  reasonable attorney's fees, it is not given discretion to summarily deny the\r\n  request without reason or explanation.Â  To do so was an abuse of discretion,\r\n  and the circuit court's ruling on the point is reversed.Â  Therefore, we remand the\r\n  attorney's fee issue for (1) a determination of who is the prevailing party in\r\n  light of our remanding the common expenses issue for consideration and (2) findings\r\n  of fact with regard to a reasonable amount of attorney's fees.\r\nAccordingly, the order of the\r\n  circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED\r\n  IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nFEW, C.J., and THOMAS and\r\n  KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The pro rata share of the Archives lease was 3.2%.\r\n[2] The monthly fee under the Archives lease was $50.00\r\n  per month.\r\n[3] Both leases contained the following provision:\r\n\r\n  Section\r\n    7.1Â  Building Services:Â  Landlord\r\n    agrees to furnish to the Leased Premises during hours of generally recognized\r\n    business days, water, electricity for standard office use; heat and air\r\n    conditioning required in the Landlord's reasonable judgment for the comfortable\r\n    use and occupancy of the Leased Premises; building common area standard\r\n    cleaning and janitorial services; normal maintenance and repair of the\r\n    Property.Â  Landlord shall also maintain and keep lighted the common stairs,\r\n    entries, and toilet rooms in the Building.\r\n\r\n[4] Kitchens involved an oral agreement between a\r\n  night watchman and his employer regarding overtime wages.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-428","title":"Murphy v.
