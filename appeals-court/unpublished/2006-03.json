Saunders, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-127\r\nSubmitted February 1, 2006 â€“ Filed March 7, 2006\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Michael T. Brittingham and James T. Hedgepath, both of Columbia, for Appellants.Â  \r\n        Max T. Hyde, Jr., of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The circuit court reversed the decision of the Long Term Disability Appeals Committee of the Employee Insurance Programs terminating Eileene Colemanâ€™s long-term disability (LTD) insurance benefits.Â  Standard Insurance Company and The State Budget and Control Board of South Carolina (Appellants) appeal the circuit courtâ€™s decision.Â  We reverse.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nColeman worked as a registered nurse manager for the South Carolina Department of Corrections.Â  Coleman had LTD insurance through the Stateâ€™s Long Term Disability Income Benefit Plan.Â  Standard Insurance Company is claims administrator of the Plan.Â  If a member becomes disabled while covered under the Plan, the member may receive LTD benefits.Â  To be eligible for benefits for the first two years of a disability, a member must meet the Planâ€™s â€œOwn Occupationâ€ definition of disability.Â  \r\n\r\n  Own Occupation means any employment . . . that involves Material Duties of the same general character as your regular and ordinary employment with the Employer.Â  Your Own Occupation is not limited to your job with your Employer.Â  \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Doctor Byron Bailey diagnosed Coleman with â€œa right-sided disc herniation at C5-6â€ based on an MRI scan.Â  Coleman had a history of chronic neck pain before this diagnosis and, since at least 1993, took several medications for this pain, for hypertension, and for depression.Â  On August 7, 2000, Coleman had a â€œC5-6 anterior cervical diskectomy and fusionâ€ in an attempt to alleviate her pain.Â  As a result, Coleman applied for LTD benefits, which Appellants granted on November 20, 2000.[2]Â  \r\nOver the next several months Colemanâ€™s condition improved though she still complained of some pain.Â  In July 2001, Coleman saw Doctor Ronald A. McIver, a pain specialist, for the first time.Â  Coleman complained of significant pain in her cervical spine and upper torso.Â  Coleman indicated she could not do her household chores or enjoy her hobbies of traveling and gardening.Â  \r\nAfter some treatments from Dr. McIver, and even though Coleman reported her condition had improved and she was sleeping better, Dr. McIver performed a nerve root block procedure to help with the pain.Â  Coleman reported â€œexcellent reliefâ€ as a result of this procedure.Â  In early August, after Coleman returned from a five-day trip to Atlanta, she reported she â€œwas able to â€˜walk all over Atlanta.â€™â€Â  She then went on a ten-day camping trip to Michigan, and the evidence indicates she tolerated her medications well, and her condition continued to improve.Â  \r\nDoctor Elias Dickerman, a consulting physician for Appellants, reviewed Colemanâ€™s file in the fall of 2001.Â  Dr. Dickerman noted Colemanâ€™s position as a nurse manager may qualify as a medium capacity position, requiring some heavier lifting, â€œonly because of the potential that she might need to handle inmates directly.â€Â  Based on his evaluation of Colemanâ€™s medical records, Dr. Dickerman concluded â€œthis patient can perform activities at the light capacity category with many activities up to the medium capacity category.â€Â  \r\nBased on information related to Colemanâ€™s South Carolina Retirement System (SCRS) claim and a questionnaire completed by Dr. Bailey describing Colemanâ€™s physical capacities, Appellants determined that Coleman could perform the duties required by her job.[3]Â  Colemanâ€™s claim was closed with a transitional benefit of $2,500.Â  Coleman appealed that determination.\r\nAs part of the appeal process, Dr. William Stewart, a Clinical Associate Professor of Rehabilitation Counseling and Neuropsychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, reviewed Colemanâ€™s file.Â  He opined that Colemanâ€™s job involved medium capacity work, â€œwith the reasonable expectation that the job would, in fact, require heavy and even very heaving physical strength in emergency situations.â€Â  He noted that the classification of registered nurse manager as light work â€œis only intended as an average or guide in describing what a worker does/has to do physically. . . .â€Â  Finally, Dr. Stewart offered the following opinion after listing the medications Coleman took:Â  â€œI have worked with many workers over the years who would not be able to maintain adequate concentration and attention span to perform a skilled job such as Registered Nurse Manger/Director of Nursing while taking these medications.â€ \r\nKarol Paquette, a vocational case manager for Appellants, prepared a memorandum regarding Colemanâ€™s appeal package and indicated that the United States Department of Labor listed Colemanâ€™s occupation as sedentary.Â  Dr. Dickerman also reviewed Colemanâ€™s appeal and concluded her occupation should be categorized as sedentary.Â  He further noted that Coleman could perform the duties of a registered nurse manager and that there appeared to be no cognitive side effects from her medication. \r\nThe decision to close Colemanâ€™s LTD claim was upheld by her caseworker, Appellantsâ€™ quality assurance unit, and by the appeals committee.Â  Coleman appealed to the circuit court, which reversed the committeeâ€™s decision.Â  The reversal was based largely on the conclusion Colemanâ€™s pain medication could impede her ability to function in her present occupation or a similar one.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants argue substantial evidence in the record supports the committeeâ€™s decision to close Colemanâ€™s LTD benefits on December 7, 2001, and, therefore, the circuit court misapplied its standard of review.Â  We agree.\r\nSection 1-23-380(A) of the South Carolina Code (2005) provides for judicial review of the decision of a state agency.Â  Section 1-23-380(A)(6)(e) and (f) provide that, upon judicial review of the decision of a state agency:\r\n\r\n  [t]he court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  The court may affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings.Â  The court may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions are . . . (e) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record; or (f) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Therefore, this court must affirm the findings of fact made by the committee if they are supported by substantial evidence.Â  Tiller v. Natâ€™l Health Care Ctr. of Sumter, 334 S.C. 333, 338, 513 S.E.2d 843, 845 (1999); Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306&nbsp;(1981).Â  Substantial evidence is that evidence which, in considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the administrative agency reached.Â  Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 160, 519 S.E.2d 102, 105&nbsp;(1999); McGuffin v. Schlumberger-Sangamo, 307 S.C. 184, 186, 414 S.E.2d 162, 163&nbsp;(1992).Â  When a conflict in the evidence exists, the findings of fact of the administrative agency are conclusive.Â  Glover v. Columbia Hosp. of Richland County, 236 S.C. 410, 418, 114 S.E.2d 565, 569&nbsp;(1960).Â  â€œThe possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agencyâ€™s findings from being supported by substantial evidence.â€Â  Tiller, 334 at 338-39, 513 S.E.2d at 845.\r\nThe research of Paquette and Dr. Dickerman supports the committeeâ€™s finding that Colemanâ€™s own occupation of nurse manager is sedentary in nature.Â  Likewise, Dr. Baileyâ€™s evaluation of Coleman, Colemanâ€™s SCRS testimony, and Dr. Dickermanâ€™s opinion on Colemanâ€™s limitations support the decision of the committee that Coleman is capable of performing sedentary to light work.Â  Finally, no evidence in the record indicates Coleman had cognitive difficulties as a result of her medication.Â  In fact, the substantial evidence in the record indicates Colemanâ€™s medicine was effective and well tolerated.Â  \r\nAs a result of the record presented to it, the committee closed Colemanâ€™s claim.Â  The committeeâ€™s decision emphasized Paquetteâ€™s vocational review, Dr. Dickermanâ€™s medical review, the notes of Bailey and McIver, and Colemanâ€™s testimony to the SCRS.Â  In contrast, the circuit courtâ€™s order emphasized Dr. Stewartâ€™s recommendations and comments, derived a different inference from Dr. McIverâ€™s notes, and weighed the other evidence differently than did the committee.Â  Under these circumstances, we hold the circuit court improperly applied its standard of review, and substantial evidence in the record supports the decision of the committee.Â  Therefore, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The benefits became retroactively effective on August 28, 2000.Â  \r\n[3] Following her surgery Coleman also applied for disability retirement with the SCRS.Â  At a hearing in 2001, Coleman testified she could regularly drive a car, maintain her home, and walk short distances, and believed she could return to work as a nurse practitioner.Â  Her application for disability retirement was denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-128","title":"Heller v.

Rucker, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-128\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2006 â€“ Filed March 7, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        H. Wesley Kirkland, Jr. and John S. Nichols, both of Columbia, for Appellant. \r\n        Donald Bruce Clark, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this divorce action, Joyce Heller contends the family court erred in its distribution of marital property and in failing to award attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm as modified.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nJohn Graham Heller (Husband) and Joyce McDonald Heller (Wife) married on November 26, 1989.Â  Both had adult children from previous relationships.Â  They separated on April 4, 2000 and Husband filed for divorce in July 2001.Â  During the marriage, Husband worked at Columbia Supply Company earning $5.30 per hour.Â  Wife was a teacher at Newberry High School for the first five years of the marriage.Â  She later resigned and did not work for two to three years until she obtained part-time employment with the census bureau.Â  She also taught summer school courses at Newberry College.Â  \r\nDuring the marriage, the parties lived at 725 Caldwell Street in Newberry, South Carolina.Â  The marital home was titled in Wifeâ€™s name.Â  She acquired the home for $188,000 approximately a year and a half before the parties met.Â  This home sold shortly after the parties separated for a net gain of approximately $267,000. \r\nThe parties also owned rental properties at 723 Caldwell Street and 719 Caldwell Street.Â  Although 719 Caldwell Street was acquired by both parties from the proceeds of a note and mortgage, of which Husband was an obligor together with Wife, both properties were in Wifeâ€™s name until they were sold on March 11, 2002.Â  After the parties separated, Wife entered into an installment sales contract to sell 719 Caldwell Street to her son for $36,000.Â  The property was previously valued on their 2000 Income Tax Return at $52,135 and was being depreciated as an investment property.Â  Prior to trial, the parties stipulated that 719 Caldwell Street was marital property.Â  Based in part on his role in obtaining the property, Husband asserted the difference in value between the amount Wife sold the property to her son and its value as reflected on their tax returns, should be credited towards the marital estate.\r\nThroughout the marriage, Husband and Wife placed their incomes in a joint account, out of which Wife paid all the expenses associated with the marriage.Â  Wife testified that she voluntarily retired at the end of the 1994 school year as a full time employee of the Newberry County School District at a salary of more than $30,000 per year.Â  From that time forward, she drew regularly from her non-marital IRA account to assist with the partiesâ€™ living expenses.Â  In fact, she withdrew approximately $219,000 from her IRA during her eight-year period of unemployment.Â  \r\nHusband maintained four retirement accounts, which earned approximately $123,000 during the marriage.Â  However, in his answers to interrogatories, Husband listed only his Thrift Savings Plan.Â  Husband testified that he failed to mention the other accounts because the Thrift Savings Plan was the only account to which he voluntarily contributed.Â  Husband denied he intentionally misled the court regarding the retirement accounts, but based his responses upon a misunderstanding.Â  \r\nBoth Husband and Wife testified that during the marriage they lived a lifestyle beyond their means.Â  As a result, the parties accumulated a great deal of credit card debt throughout the marriage.Â  The debt as of June 2001 was $33,700.Â  Husband and Wife also spent money to renovate their marital home.Â  Husband testified that he performed many repairs on the home, including replacing numerous support beams.Â  \r\nAround June 2001, the couple mutually inventoried all property in the partiesâ€™ possession.Â  They agreed to conduct an auction to sell the majority of the marital assets as well as some non-marital assets.Â  The auction was held in June 2001 and the sale of marital assets generated $34,500.Â  Wife used the proceeds to pay off marital debt.Â  Much of the contention at trial came from the fact that after the parties separated, Husband moved out of the home and thereafter did not assist Wife in making the mortgage payments.Â  In fact, it was not until he was ordered to do so by the court that Husband contributed $498.00 a month to help with the mortgage payments.Â  Husband made those payments from December 2001 through March 2002. \r\nThe family court concluded the partiesâ€™ marital contributions were nearly equivalent, with Wife contributing more income during the early years of the marriage and Husband contributing more income in the latter stages.Â  The family court ordered each party to be responsible for his or her own attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  Wife moved for reconsideration of this order.Â  Following a hearing, the family court amended the order to correct clerical mistakes and to account for Husbandâ€™s three previously undisclosed retirement accounts.Â  The family court ordered Wife to pay Husband $1,465.76 to equalize and divide the equity in the marital property and debts.Â  The family court denied relief on all other issues raised in Wifeâ€™s motion.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 283, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œNor must we ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.â€Â  Lacke v. Lacke, 362 S.C. 302, 307, 608 S.E.2d 147, 150 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Our broad scope of review does not relieve appellant of her burden to convince this court the family court committed error.Â  Skinner v. King, 272 S.C. 520, 522-23, 252 S.E.2d 891, 892 (1979).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transmutation of 725 and 723 Caldwell Street \r\nWife contends the family court erred in finding a portion of the residence at 725 Caldwell Street and the adjoining apartment at 723 Caldwell Street were transmuted.Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nUnder the Equitable Apportionment of Marital Property Act, property acquired by either party before the marriage is nonmarital property.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473(2) (Supp. 2005). Â â€œIn certain circumstances, however, nonmarital property . . . may be transmuted into marital property during the marriage.â€Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 295, 372 S.E.2d 107, 110 (Ct. App. 1988), cert. denied, 298 S.C. 117, 378 S.E.2d 445 (1989).\r\n\r\n  Property, nonmarital at the time of its acquisition, may be transmuted (1) if it becomes so commingled with marital property as to be untraceable; (2) if it is titled jointly; or (3) if it is utilized by the parties in support of the marriage or in some manner so as to evidence an intent by the parties to make it marital property.Â  \r\n\r\nTrimnal v. Trimnal, 287 S.C. 495, 497-98, 339 S.E.2d 869, 870 (1986).Â  Transmutation is a matter of intent to be gleaned from the facts of each case.Â  Johnson at 295, 372 S.E.2d at 110.Â  The spouse claiming transmutation must produce objective evidence showing that, during the marriage, the parties themselves regarded the property as the common property of the marriage.Â Â  Id. at 295, 372 S.E.2d at 111.\r\nHusband contends the family court did not base its decision on the theory that the properties had been transmuted, but instead, based its decision on an award of a â€œspecial equity.â€Â  In fact, Husband never sought a finding of transmutation.Â  However, the family court found that with regard to the marital residence a portion of it was transmuted.Â  The family court went on to state â€œ[t]he Plaintiff also during the marriage performed maintenance and repairs on the said property, thereby increasing the value of the property.Â  This [family] Court finds that the husband has 20% equity in 723-725 Caldwell home.â€Â  In explaining its order, the family court stated that its apportionment was based on â€œ[Husbandâ€™s] efforts in working with the house and then the amount thatâ€™s transmuted by the mortgage.â€Â  Additionally, Wife testified, and Husband confirmed, that Wifeâ€™s will, executed early in the marriage, gave Husband a life estate in the marital home should she predecease him.Â  \r\nThe evidence produced at trial does not support a finding that the property was transmuted.Â  â€œThe mere use of separate property to support a marriage, without some additional evidence of intent to treat it as property of the marriage, is not sufficient to establish transmutation.â€Â  Id. at 295-96, 372 S.E.2d at 111.Â  In addition, the use of marital funds to make improvements to property, without more, is insufficient to establish intent to transmute property.Â  Stefan v. Stefan, 320 S.C. 419, 424, 465 S.E.2d 734, 737 (Ct. App. 1995).\r\nIn Husbandâ€™s direct examination, his attorney inquired â€œ[n]ow, are you asking this court to award you a special â€“ I am going to call it a special equity in the enhanced value of the home?â€Â  To which Husband answered â€œyes.â€Â  At that point Husbandâ€™s counsel said â€œ[a]ll right.Â  Now, your honor, may we approach?Â  I donâ€™t want to make an error.â€Â  Following an off-the-record discussion, Husbandâ€™s counsel made his case for special equity and never mentioned transmutation.Â  During cross examination, Husband stated â€œI still am not asking for part of the house . . . [but am asking for] [m]y sweat equity and also my financial contribution.â€\r\nA spouse has a special equity in any increase in the value of nonmarital property during the marriage to the extent the increase resulted directly or indirectly from efforts of the spouse during marriage.Â  Webber v. Webber, 285 S.C. 425, 427-28, 330 S.E.2d 79, 81 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  Husband testified as to repairs he performed for the home including replacing numerous support beams.Â  The equitable interest in the properties awarded to Husband was substantiated by evidence presented at trial, and was therefore proper.Â  Though Husband is not entitled to have the property apportioned as transmuted property, he is entitled to a special equity.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equitable Apportionment\r\nThe apportionment of marital property will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Bungener v. Bungener, 291 S.C. 247, 251, 353 S.E.2d 147, 150 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  On appeal, this court looks to the overall fairness of the apportionment.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  If the end result is equitable, it is irrelevant that the appellate court would have arrived at a different apportionment.Â  Id.Â  \r\nA. Rental Property Expenses\r\nWife contends the family court erred in failing to take into account expenses she incurred in the upkeep of the rental properties from the time of separation until the hearing.Â  She argues the court erred when it awarded Husband an interest in one-half of the rent received from 719 Caldwell Street and twenty percent of the rent from the garage apartment at 723 Caldwell Street.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nWifeâ€™s expenses included maintaining and repairing the property from the time of separation until the hearing, or at least until she sold the property.Â  During this time, Husband did not live in or maintain the house.Â  The trial court deducted from Husbandâ€™s property 50% of the marital debt from 723 and 725 Caldwell Street paid by Wife during the separation.Â  Furthermore, Wife failed to present any evidence of additional maintenance expenses at trial.Â  The trial courtâ€™s apportionment of the property and the debt incurred from the property was not an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\nB.Â  Marital Assets Retained by Husband \r\nWife contends the family court erred in failing to take into account the marital assets retained by Husband.Â  We disagree. Â \r\nAt issue are two antique oil lamps and a 1991 Mercedes Benz that Husband obtained to replace the 1982 Mercedes Benz the parties purchased during the marriage.Â  Wife failed to prove, during trial, the value of any lamps.Â  The only mention of antique lamps came when Wife testified as to why there existed so much credit card debt and she replied, â€œ[w]e bought a lot of antiques.Â  We bought at least a dozen antique oil lamps and a dozen antique clocks.â€Â  On the other hand, the two automobiles were mentioned. Â There was testimony that Wife kept one car owned by the couple while Husband kept the Mercedes Benz.Â  \r\nApportionment of the marital estate is within the sound discretion of the family court.Â  Brandi v. Brandi, 302 S.C. 353, 357, 396 S.E.2d 124, 126 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  There was no evidence presented at trial concerning the value of the lamps.Â  There was only a slight difference in the value of the two automobiles, which the family court considered.Â  We find no abuse of discretion and affirm the family courtâ€™s determination on this matter. \r\nIII.&nbsp;Value of 719 Caldwell Street \r\nWife contends the family court erred in valuing 719 Caldwell Street at $52,135 where the preponderance of the evidence established the fair market value was $36,000.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nHusband testified the value of 719 Caldwell Street was $52,135, which was the value the parties listed on their Income Tax Returns in 2000.Â  Wife testified she sold the property to her son for $36,000.\r\nThe family court has broad discretion in adopting the value of property. Woodward v. Woodward, 294 S.C. 210, 215, 363 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. App. 1987) (stating the family courtâ€™s valuation of property will be affirmed if it is within the range of the evidence); Smith v. Smith, 294 S.C. 194, 198, 363 S.E.2d 404, 407 (Ct. App. 1987) (holding the family court may accept one partyâ€™s valuation of marital property over that of the other party).Â  The family courtâ€™s valuation was within the range of evidence presented at trial.Â  The family court found the sale between Wife and her son was not an armâ€™s length transaction and thus, determined the value based upon the evidence presented at trial.Â  We find no abuse of discretion and affirm the family courtâ€™s finding that the correct value was $52,135. \r\nIV.&nbsp;Attorneyâ€™s Fees and Costs \r\nWife contends the family court erred in denying her request for an award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn determining whether attorneyâ€™s fees should be awarded, the court should consider the following factors:Â  the partyâ€™s ability to pay his/her own attorneyâ€™s fees; beneficial results obtained by the attorney; the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions; and the effect of the attorneyâ€™s fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M, 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  In determining the reasonable amount of attorneyâ€™s fees to award, the family court should consider the nature, extent and difficulty of the services rendered, the time necessarily devoted to the case, counselâ€™s professional standing, the contingency of compensation, the beneficial results obtained, and the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).Â  \r\nWife asserts that because Husband failed to present his retirement accounts in their entirety during discovery, she should be awarded attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  The court denied this request and stated â€œthere are two things really that ran up the attorneyâ€™s fees here.Â  One is his retirement, as you just mentioned, and the second is the argument over whether or not a portion of the house was transmuted.â€Â  \r\nâ€œAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs is a discretionary matter not to be overturned absent abuse by the trial court.â€ Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 365, 384 S.E.2d 741, 748 (1989).Â  We have reviewed the family courtâ€™s failure to award attorneyâ€™s fees in light of the applicable factors and find no abuse of discretion.\r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.[1]Â  \r\nSTILWELL, KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-129","title":"South Carolina Department of Social Services v.

Armstrong, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-129\r\nSubmitted March 1, 2006 â€“ Filed March 8, 2006Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        H. Fred Kuhn, Jr., of Beaufort, for Appellant.\r\n        Tracy Oâ€™Kelly Klatt, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n        Stacey Patterson Canaday, of Beaufort, for Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Felicia McDaniels appeals from the family courtâ€™s termination of her parental rights to her two children.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMcDaniels and Bernard Holmes had two children together, Mecca Holmes, born September 8, 1993 and Jeremy Holmes, born September 28, 1994.Â  McDaniels and Holmes, who were never married, ended their romantic relationship shortly after Jeremyâ€™s birth.Â  The children lived with McDaniels in her home in Los Angeles County, California until 1999 when they came to live with their father in South Carolina.Â  The children were removed from Holmesâ€™ residence by the South Carolina Department of Social Services based on allegations of physical abuse by Holmes of both children and later allegations of sexual abuse of Mecca by Holmes.Â  \r\nThe County of Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services conducted two home studies on McDaniels.Â  In the first study, the social worker recommended the children not be returned to McDaniels at that time.Â  In the second study, however, the social worker did recommend they be returned to her.Â  During the time that the children have been in foster care, McDaniels has not visited them or sent any child support.Â  \r\nAfter a hearing at which neither parent appeared,[2] the family court ordered termination of the parental rights of McDaniels and Holmes to both children.Â  The court found as grounds to support termination that the children had been in foster care for fifteen of the past twenty-two months, that McDaniels had willfully failed to support the children or make a material contribution to their care, and that she had willfully failed to visit them.Â  In addition, the court held termination of parental rights was in the best interests of the children.Â  The court subsequently denied McDanielsâ€™ motion to alter or amend the judgment.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n â€œIn a termination of parental rights (TPR) case, the best interests of the children are the paramount consideration.â€Â  Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Before a parentâ€™s rights may be terminated, the alleged grounds for termination must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Department of Soc. Servs. v. Mrs. H, 346 S.C. 329, 333, 550 S.E.2d 898, 901 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  On appeal, this court may review the record and make its own determination of whether the grounds for termination are supported by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Id.Â  However, our broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the findings of the family court or ignore the fact that the family court was in a better position to assess the credibility of the witnesses.Â  Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nUnder South Carolinaâ€™s TPR statute, â€œ[t]he family court may order the termination of parental rights upon a finding of one or more of the [listed] grounds and a finding that termination is in the best interest of the child.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2005).Â  The family court found the following grounds to terminate McDanielâ€™s parental rights:Â  1) the children had been in foster care for fifteen out of the past twenty-two months, (2) McDaniels had willfully failed to support the children, and (3) she had willfully failed to visit them.Â  \r\nOur statutory scheme provides a ground for termination of parental rights where the child has been in foster care under the responsibility of the State for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(8) (Supp. 2005).Â  It is undisputed that the children had been in foster care since April 5, 2002.Â  The order terminating McDanielsâ€™ parental rights was entered May 20, 2004.Â  Accordingly, we find clear and convincing evidence supports this ground for termination.Â  \r\nSection 20-7-1572(4) provides as a ground for termination:\r\n\r\n  The child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period of six months, and during that time the parent has wilfully failed to support the child. Â Failure to support means that the parent has failed to make a material contribution to the childâ€™s care.Â  A material contribution consists of either financial contributions according to the parentâ€™s means or contributions of food, clothing, shelter, or other necessities for the care of the child according to the parentâ€™s means.Â  The court may consider all relevant circumstances in determining whether or not the parent has wilfully failed to support the child, including requests for support by the custodian and the ability of the parent to provide support.\r\n\r\nWhether a parentâ€™s failure to support a child is willful is a question of intent to be determined from all the facts and circumstances in each case.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 52, 413 S.E.2d 835, 838 (1992).Â  The trial judge is given wide discretion in making this determination.Â  Id.Â  However, the element of willfulness must be established by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Id.Â  â€œParental conduct â€˜which evinces a settled purpose to forego parental duties may fairly be characterized as â€˜willfulâ€™ because it manifests a conscious indifference to the rights of the child to receive support and consortium from the parent.â€™â€Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Smith, 343 S.C. 129, 137, 538 S.E.2d 285, 289 (Ct. App. 2000) (quoting Broome, 307 S.C. at 53, 413 S.E.2d at 839).\r\nMcDaniels is unemployed and has two other children.Â  However, she receives $704 in cash aid a month and $195 for food stamps.Â  She also has Section 8 housing.Â  Her monthly expenses amount to $528.Â  Although her income exceeds her expenses, she failed to pay any support for the children and has only sent them coloring books since they were placed in foster care.Â  We find clear and convincing evidence to support the family courtâ€™s finding that McDaniels willfully failed to support the children.Â Â Â  \r\nHaving found at least one ground on which the family court properly terminated McDanielsâ€™ parental rights, we need only determine that termination of McDanielsâ€™ rights is in the best interest of the children.[3]Â  The interests of the child shall prevail if the childâ€™s interests and the parental rights conflict.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 259, 519 S.E.2d 351, 356 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nAlthough the social worker that performed the second home study for the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services recommended the children be returned to McDaniels, the guardian ad litem took exception to this conclusion and recommended termination of McDanielsâ€™ parental rights.Â  The guardian noted that the children had expressed a desire to go back to their mother.Â  However, their reason for stating this was always, â€œBecause she beats me less than Dad does.â€Â  The guardian testified that McDaniels had called her very regularly in the beginning, but when the guardian refused to put up with her abusive language, McDaniel ceased communicating with her.Â  The Los Angeles social worker noted that McDaniels â€œappears to have a great deal of anger and has at times dealt with this anger in the form of inappropriate letters, phone calls and threats.â€Â  The social worker had concerns about this anger problem but found it did not appear to manifest itself as a risk towards her two young children who live with her.Â  McDaniels has been prescribed Prozac, but she admits she does not take it every day as prescribed.Â  There is no evidence in the record that McDaniels has seen the children since she sent them to live with their father in 1999.\r\nWhen the children were originally placed in foster care, they were very frightened and withdrawn.Â  At the time of the hearing, they were doing well in their foster home and were back on the honor roll in school.Â  The foster parents have expressed an interest in adopting them.Â  \r\nWe find clear and convincing evidence that termination of McDanielsâ€™ parental rights is in the best interest of the children.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.Â \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]McDanielsâ€™ appointed counsel filed a motion requesting the court order DSS to pay for transportation costs for McDaniels so that she could attend the final hearing.Â  The court denied the request noting counsel failed to provide the court with authority allowing it to order such costs.Â  \r\n[3] As we find clear and convincing evidence to support other grounds, we do not address the ground of willful failure to visit. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-130","title":"Unger v.

Thompson, of Laurens, for Respondents/Appellants.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Scott Unger, Mitchell Realty, and Craftmasters General Contractors appeal the grant of summary judgment on various contractual actions against Theodore Leviton and Fountainbrook Associates arising out of a failed business relationship.Â  Leviton and Fountainbrook cross-appeal contempt findings and sanctions issued against them in a related proceeding.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1995, Scott Unger, a New York resident, signed a contract with an entity called HeadSouth to build houses in the Fountainbrook subdivision (the subdivision) in Laurens County, South Carolina.Â  The subdivision property belonged to Eric Hedrick, the sole shareholder of HeadSouth.Â  \r\nHedrick later experienced financial problems and was unable to continue developing the subdivision.Â  Unger then approached Theodore Leviton, also of New York, to see if Leviton would invest in the project.Â  Together, Unger and Leviton traveled to South Carolina to view the project site. \r\nLeviton apparently agreed to participate in the project and formed Fountainbrook, Inc., (the Corporation), which was to hold certain properties that were deeded to it.Â  Hedrick, with Levitonâ€™s assistance, formed VAE, Inc.Â  Concurrently with the formation of the Corporation and VAE, Leviton and Hedrick formed Fountainbrook Associates, LLC (the LLC), giving 65 per cent of the ownership of this entity to the Corporation and the remaining 35 per cent to VAE.Â  On or about April 5, 1996, HeadSouth conveyed two parcels of real estate to the Corporation. Both properties either adjoined or were close to the subdivision.\r\nSoon after the formation of the LLC, Unger formed Craftmasters General Contractors, Inc. (Craftmasters), of which he became president and sole shareholder.Â  Craftmasters became the general contractor for the subdivision, supervising the building of the infrastructure.Â  Craftmasters also had the opportunity to bid on infrastructure projects and was awarded a project if it was the lowest bidder.Â  Later, Craftmasters received the exclusive right to construct residences in the subdivision.\r\nIn addition, Leviton, Unger, and Hedrick agreed to form Mitchell Realty, Inc., (Mitchell) of which, at the time of this litigation, Unger was the sole shareholder.[1]Â  Sometime during 1996, Mitchell executed an undated written agreement with â€œall home builders selected by [the LLC] to build in their Fountainbrook subdivision.â€Â  The agreement further provided that Mitchell would â€œbe the exclusive on site marketing agent for the subdivision.â€Â  The agreement was signed by Unger in his capacity as president of Mitchell, Leviton in his capacity as managing partner of the LLC; and a representative of a construction company not involved in this litigation.Â  It was to last 36 months and was renewable for additional twelve-month periods.Â  \r\nUnger maintained that, pursuant to an oral agreement he made with Leviton, he was to receive a half interest in the Corporation in exchange for his time, services, and expertise in managing the subdivision.Â  Leviton, however, contended he agreed to share the profits with Unger at an undetermined percentage only after completion of the subdivision and provided Unger had performed properly.\r\nLeviton, his wife, and Gloria Brill were owners of MacLeben Associates, LLC.Â  Around the same time as the subdivision was being developed, MacLeben bought real property to be held by Hewlett Associates, LLC, and Glen Oaks Associates, LLC.Â  Although there is no written documentation that Unger had any ownership interests in Hewlett or Glen Oaks or provided capital for the benefit of these entities, Unger testified he contributed his time and expertise to the development of these properties with the understanding that he would receive an ownership interest in each of the projects. \r\nMitchell, Craftmasters, and the LLC used the same office complex until 2000, when Leviton ended his business relationships with Unger and forced Mitchell, Craftmasters, and Unger out of the complex. \r\nOn June 22, 2000, Unger, Mitchell Realty, and Craftmasters (collectively referred to as Plaintiffs) brought suit against Leviton and the LLC (collectively referred to as Defendants) alleging sixteen causes of action arising out of the aborted business relationship and requesting actual and punitive damages as well as injunctive relief.Â  Defendants answered and counterclaimed, and Plaintiffs filed replies.\r\nAfter the parties completed discovery, Defendants moved for summary judgment.Â  The trial court heard the matter on August 19, 2002.Â  While the summary judgment motion was under advisement, the trial court signed a consent order in which the parties agreed that Defendants would follow certain procedures when selling the subdivision property.Â  The procedures included providing the Plaintiffs with accountings and depositing certain funds into an account held by the Clerk of Court for Laurens County pending final disposition of the case.\r\nOn June 12, 2003,[2] the trial court signed an order granting Leviton summary judgment on four causes of action for breach of contract, two actions for tortious interference with contracts, and two claims for intentional interference with prospective contractual relations.[3]Â  The same day, the trial court also issued a contempt order against Defendants, finding they failed to give an accounting to Plaintiffs as required by prior order and ordering Defendants to pay Plaintiffs $2,000 as a sanction for noncompliance.Â  After Defendants unsuccessfully moved for reconsideration, both parties appealed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in finding the purported agreement between the LLC and Mitchell was unenforceable against the LLC.Â  We find no reversible error.\r\nâ€œA contract exists where there is an agreement between two or more persons upon sufficient consideration either to do or not to do a particular act.Â  The essentials of a contract include an offer and acceptance.â€[4]Â  \r\nPlaintiffs based this breach of contract claim on two listing agreements signed by Leviton as managing partner for the LLC, by Unger, for Mitchell Realty, and by a third party representing the builders.Â  Both agreements were â€œeffective for a period of thirty-six (36) months from the date of execution of this contractâ€ and were â€œrenewable for additional twelve (12) month periods.â€Â  Neither agreement, however, was dated, and there is no evidence that either agreement was ever renewed.Â  \r\nThe trial court found the listing agreements were deficient in several respects to fulfill the requirements of a contractual obligation between Mitchell and the LLC.Â  First, based on its interpretation of the language of the agreements, the court concluded they â€œcontemplated future arrangements between Mitchell and home builders selected by [the LLC].â€Â  Second, the court noted the agreements â€œcontained no provision(s) obligating [the LLC] to Mitchell.â€Â  Third, the court found â€œno listing agreements were in existenceâ€ at the critical time.\r\nWe have found nothing in Plaintiffsâ€™ appellantsâ€™ brief challenging the trial courtâ€™s finding that the listing agreements on which they based their contract claim were not â€œin existence.â€[5]Â  Absent such a challenge, we hold this unappealed finding is a sufficient basis to affirm the grant of summary judgment on this cause of action.[6]\r\n2.Â  We agree, however, with Plaintiffsâ€™ contention that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on their action for breach of contract between the LLC and Craftmasters.\r\nThe trial court cited the following reasons to support its grant of summary judgment on this claim:Â  â€œPlaintiffs inability to state with any degree of certainty their damages flowing from the alleged breach of contract by [the LLC]; Plaintiffs uncertainty as to which Defendant was a party to the alleged contract; and the alleged Contract is in violation of the Statute of Frauds.â€\r\nAs to damages, Plaintiffs presented a letter from Ungerâ€™s accountant to Leviton stating that Craftmasters was owed $196,830.Â  Leviton signed the letter as manager of the LLC, confirming it was in agreement with his records.Â  Without explanation, the trial court stated it was â€œunconvinced that this letter constitutes sufficient proof of damages.â€Â  \r\nWe, however, find otherwise.Â  â€œAt the summary judgment stage of the proceedings, the nonmoving party need only submit a scintilla of evidence warranting determination by a jury for summary judgment to be denied.â€[7]Â  Moreover, as the supreme court has noted, â€œ â€˜[t]he law does not require absolute certainty of data upon which lost profits are to be estimated, but all that is required is such reasonable certainty that damages may not be based wholly upon speculation or conjecture.â€™ â€[8]\r\nWe also agree with Plaintiffs that the trial court erred in finding the contract was required to be in writing pursuant to the Statute of Frauds.\r\nThe statute of frauds requires a contract that is not to be performed within a year of the making to be in writing.[9]Â  Nevertheless, â€œ[t]he fact that performance within a year is highly improbable or not expected by the parties does not bring a contract within the scope of this clause.â€[10]Â  Moreover, â€œa trial court should submit an issue concerning the statute of frauds to the jury if there is evidence on which a finding either way might reasonably be made.â€[11] Â \r\n Here, the alleged contract was for Craftmasters to oversee and manage the subdivision.Â  In their pleadings, Plaintiffs alleged Craftmastersâ€™ duties included various general duties related to the development of the subdivision.Â  Although the parties may have contemplated that performance would take longer than a year, it was nevertheless possible that the work could be completed within a year or that the project would be abandoned within that time.Â  Under either of these scenarios, Craftmasters and the LLC could both perform their obligations within a year; therefore, the statute of frauds would not bar enforcement of their agreement.\r\nFinally, we disagree with the trial courtâ€™s determination that Plaintiffs were â€œuncertain as to whether the alleged Contract was between Craftmasters and Leviton or Craftmasters and [the LLC].â€Â  In his deposition, Unger stated the agreement was with the LLC â€œassuming that [Leviton] is representing them.â€Â  Unger also stated Leviton â€œpersonally guaranteed in the beginning of the project that he will cover all expenses.â€Â  Furthermore, Leviton himself acknowledged that he and Unger agreed Craftmasters would act as the general contractor on the entire development and that sometime later he agreed not to look for any other builders.Â  We hold this evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, creates an issue of fact as to whether Craftmasters had an agreement with either Leviton or the LLC or both defendants.\r\n3.Â  Plaintiffs further argue the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on their cause of action for breach of contract arising from Levitonâ€™s refusal to convey an ownership interest in the Corporation to Unger.Â  We reject this contention.Â  \r\nThe trial court determined any alleged agreement between Unger and Leviton for an equity interest in the Corporation was unenforceable as a matter of law because it was not in writingâ€”as required by statute when it was purportedly executedâ€”and because it was barred by the doctrine of judicial estoppel based on an inconsistent statement Unger made during another lawsuit.Â  We affirm the grant of summary judgment on this cause of action, finding no reversible in the trial courtâ€™s application of judicial estoppel.[12]\r\nIn Cothran v. Brown, the supreme court adopted the following requirements for the application of judicial estoppel:\r\n\r\n  (1) two inconsistent positions taken by the same party or parties in privity with one another; (2) the positions must be taken in the same or related proceedings involving the same party or parties in privity with each other; (3) the party taking the position must have been successful in maintaining that position and have received some benefit; (4) the inconsistency must be part of an intentional effort to mislead the court; and (5) the two positions must be totally inconsistent.[13]\r\n\r\nThe â€œinconsistent positionâ€ on which the trial court based its determination that judicial estoppel barred this claim came from a 1998 deposition Unger gave in a 1997 lawsuit in which the LLC, HeadSouth, Craftmasters, Unger, Hedrick, and Leviton were named as defendants. In the deposition, Unger testified he had no interest in either the LLC or the â€œentity which has an interest inÂ  [the LLC].â€Â  In an affidavit submitted in the present case, Unger maintained he disavowed any ownership interest in either the LLC or the Corporation â€œbased on Mr. Levitons insistence and [his attorneyâ€™s] advise.â€\r\nThe trial court found as a matter of law (1) the earlier litigation was related to the present case in that both involved claims by Unger; (2) Unger received a benefit from taking the position he asserted in the prior litigation; (3) Unger â€œadmit[ted] that he intentionally lied during the course of his Deposition relative to the [prior case] and therefore it is clear that Unger clearly intended to mislead the Courtâ€; and (4) Ungerâ€™s position in the prior lawsuit regarding his ownership interest in the Corporation was totally inconsistent with his position in the present matter.\r\nIn disputing the trial courtâ€™s finding that the two lawsuits were â€œrelatedâ€ for the purpose of applying judicial estoppel, Plaintiffs argue only the following:\r\n\r\n  [T]he alleged inconsistent position was not taken â€œin the same or related proceedings involving the same party or parties in privity with each other,â€ so the testimony did not give rise to a judicial estoppel.Â  Although both actions may have dealt with issues relative to the Subdivision, the actions did not have the relation contemplated by the doctrine of judicial doctrine estoppel. \r\n\r\nThis argument offers nothing by way of explanation of the pertinent facts or supporting authority as to why the trial court was incorrect in finding that the proceedings were related.Â  It is not this courtâ€™s responsibility to ferret out the facts from the record or to find the authority to support an appellantâ€™s contentions.[14]Â  \r\nAs to the requirement that the prior proceeding involve â€œthe same party or parties in privity with each other,â€ Unger argues only that the plaintiff in the prior litigation was not connected with any of the parties in the present lawsuit.Â  There is no requirement, however, that the prior litigation be restricted to those parties in the present case.Â  Rather, privity is required only between the party against whom the doctrine of judicial estoppel is asserted and the party who made the inconsistent statement in the prior proceeding.[15]\r\nPlaintiffs further argue that â€œUnger has received no benefitâ€ because both he and Leviton were defendants in the earlier case.Â  This argument, however, does not discredit the trial courtâ€™s findings that Unger was successful in the prior lawsuit in that the case was dismissed and no judgment was taken against either Unger or Craftmasters.[16]\r\nFinally, Plaintiffs contend Leviton should not be allowed to assert the doctrine of judicial estoppel because of his own misconduct in instructing Unger to give an untruthful answer during the deposition.Â  The trial court did not address this argument, and the record does not indicate Plaintiffs moved for a post-trial ruling on the matter; therefore, we hold Plaintiffs have not preserved this argument for appeal.[17]\r\n4.Â  Plaintiffs further contend the trial court erred in summarily dismissing their claim for breach of contract arising out of an alleged oral agreement by Leviton to convey Unger ownership interests in Hewlett Associates and Glen Oaks.Â  We hold summary judgment on this cause of action was premature.\r\nThe trial court found that, when the parties allegedly made the agreement, it was not enforceable under then-existing South Carolina Code section 36-8-319 because it was not in writing.[18]Â  \r\nWe do not necessarily accept Plaintiffsâ€™ contention that, because the present version of section 36-8-103 classifies a limited liability company as a security under only very limited circumstances, the transaction at issue was not subject to section 36-8-319.[19]Â  Nevertheless, Plaintiffs correctly argue the entities at issue here are both limited liability companies, which, under the law in effect at the time of the agreement would be â€œsecuritiesâ€ subject to section 36-8-319 only if accompanied by other criteria, none of which were shown to be applicable here.[20]Â  We therefore reverse the grant of summary judgment on this cause of action and remand the claim for a determination of whether Unger and Leviton had an agreement regarding the transfer of interests in the Hewlett and Glen Oaks properties.\r\n5.Â  We reject Plaintiffsâ€™ arguments concerning summary judgment on their causes of action for tortious interference with Craftmastersâ€™ contract with Grand South Bank, which financed the project, and Mitchellâ€™s contracts with various builders and realtors.Â  \r\n â€œThe elements of a cause of action for tortious interference with contract are:Â  (1) existence of a valid contract; (2) the wrongdoerâ€™s knowledge thereof; (3) his intentional procurement of its breach; (4) the absence of justification; and (5) resulting damages.â€[21]\r\nAs to Craftmastersâ€™ contract with Grand South, the trial court found (1) Plaintiffs did not identify any particular contractual arrangements between themselves and the bank; and (2) Plaintiffs failed to provide evidence of any actions or inactions by Defendants that could have amounted to interference with any such arrangements.Â  \r\nAssuming without deciding that Craftmasters had an existing arrangement for financing with Grand South, we agree with the trial court that Plaintiffs failed to provide evidence of any acts or misconduct by Defendants that could rise to the level of tortious interference with this contract.Â  In their appellantsâ€™ brief, Plaintiffs assert Defendants encouraged Craftmasters to use the loan proceeds obtained from the bank â€œfor the general development of [the LLC], based upon . . . [D]efendantsâ€™ promise to quickly repay the funds so that they could be used on the original lots identified under the contracts with the Bank.â€Â  They further maintain Defendants then â€œrefused to repay the funds as agreed, and then encouraged the Bank to pursue breach of contract claims in the hope of damaging Plaintiffs and forcing Craftmasters and Unger out of the project.â€\r\nHere, however, the party purportedly in breach was Craftmasters, not Grand South Bank.Â  These accusations, then, even if true, do not entitle Plaintiffs to sue for tortious interference with contract.[22]Â  \r\nAs to contracts Mitchell may have had with various builders and realtors, we find no reason to reverse the trial courtâ€™s finding that Plaintiffs failed to provide evidence that any such agreements existed.Â  In their appellantsâ€™ brief, Plaintiffs argue only that they alleged in their complaint that Leviton and the LLC â€œwere aware of certain contractual relationships between [Mitchell] and other builders and realtors in the area related to the Fountainbrook Developmentâ€; however, they never cited any evidence supporting this allegation or identified any of the other parties to the purported contracts.[23]\r\n6.Â  Plaintiffs further contend the trial court should not have granted summary judgment on their cause of action for intentional interference with prospective contractual relations between Mitchell and various third parties.Â  We find no error.Â  \r\nâ€œTo recover on a cause of action for intentional interference with prospective contractual relations, . . . the plaintiff must prove: (1) the defendant intentionally interfered with the plaintiffâ€™s potential contractual relations; (2) for an improper purpose or by improper methods; (3) causing injury to the plaintiff.â€[24]Â  â€œThe plaintiff must actually demonstrate, at the outset, that he had a truly prospective (or potential) contract with a third party.â€[25]Â  â€œ[P]laintiffs must allege â€˜either a business relation with specific third parties or with an identifiable prospective class of third persons.â€™ â€[26] \r\nIn support of its grant to summary judgment on this cause of action, the trial court found Plaintiffs failed to present sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case.Â  In addition, the trial court found their request for damages was â€œhighly speculative at best, and thus barred by the holding in Hendricks vs. Clemson University.â€[27]\r\nPlaintiffsâ€™ argument in their appellantsâ€™ brief focuses on their allegation that Defendants denied them access to information and materials that Mitchell needed to show subdivision property to prospective buyers.[28]Â  Because, however, Plaintiffs did not challenge the finding that their damages were speculative, we find no reason to reverse the grant of summary judgment.[29]\r\n7.Â  We also affirm the grant of summary judgment on Plaintiffsâ€™ cause of action for intentional interference with prospective contracts that Craftmasters had relative to construction in the subdivision.Â  The trial court found Plaintiffs were unable to identify any potential contracts or parties with whom prospective contracts were pending.Â  On appeal, Plaintiffs do not point to any evidence in the record that would indicate Craftmasters had any pending sales agreements that would support a cause of action for interference with prospective contractual relations.[30]\r\n8.Â  Defendants argue the trial court erred in holding Leviton in contempt.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA determination of contempt is within the sound discretion of the trial judge, but is subject to reversal where based on a finding that is without evidentiary support or where there has been an abuse of discretion.â€[31]Â  â€œWilful disobedience of a court order will justify a finding of contempt.â€[32]Â  \r\nThe trial court found Leviton in contempt because he failed to comply with the provision in the consent order requiring him to provide Unger with accountings of sales proceeds and to follow certain other procedures required of him.Â  These findings were supported by Ungerâ€™s testimony that, although he received basic information that potential sales of property in the subdivision were pending, he never received preliminary cost estimates or a full accounting as required by the consent order.Â  Furthermore, contrary to the terms of the consent order, no money had ever been paid to the Clerk of Court from any of the sales proceeds.Â  We therefore hold the finding of contempt was supported by the evidence and within the trial courtâ€™s discretion.\r\n9.Â  We agree, however, with Defendants that the trial court erred in imposing a $2,000 sanction on Leviton.\r\nâ€œWhere compensation [for civil contempt] is extended, a fine is imposed, payable to the complainant. Such fine must of course be based upon evidence of complainant's actual loss.â€[33]Â  â€œIncluded in the actual loss are the costs in defending and enforcing the courtâ€™s order, including litigation costs and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The burden of showing what amount, if anything, the complainant is entitled to recover by way of compensation should be on the complainant.[34]\r\nIn the present case, the trial court did not specify whether the contempt was civil or criminal.Â  The fine, however, was payable to Unger; therefore, the sanction was compensatory and accordingly should have been limited to Ungerâ€™s actual losses.Â  Because trial court did not make findings of Ungerâ€™s actual losses, we remand this issue to the trial court to make the necessary findings of fact and to impose a monetary sanction based on Ungerâ€™s actual losses. Â \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED IN PART.\r\n GOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Although Unger, Leviton, and Hedrick initially agreed that they would each own one third of Mitchellâ€™s outstanding capital stock, Leviton did not become a stockholder because he lacked a South Carolina real estate brokerâ€™s license.\r\n[2]Â  The order indicates it was signed June 12, 2002, which is inconsistent with the fact that the hearing was not until August 2002.Â  Although the filing date is not legible, Plaintiffsâ€™ appellantsâ€™ brief indicates the order was signed June 12, 2003.\r\n[3]Â  The trial court denied summary judgment on four causes of action, and the parties disposed of the remaining causes of action by agreement.\r\n[4]Â  Benya v. Gamble, 282 S.C. 624, 628, 321 S.E.2d 57, 60 (Ct. App. 1984) (citations omitted).\r\n[5]Â  The parties appear to agree that Defendants, when moving for summary judgment, never raised the argument that the agreements, by their own terms, had â€œexpiredâ€ in 1999.Â  Nevertheless, the trial court appeared to rule on the matter by recognizing â€œthe fact that no listing agreements were in existence.â€Â  It would have been incumbent on the Plaintiffs to argue on appeal that the ruling was factually incorrect or based on procedural irregularity.Â  See Buckner v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., 255 S.C. 159, 161, 177 S.E.2d 544, 544 (1970) (stating an unchallenged ruling, â€œright or wrong, is the law of [the] case and requires affirmanceâ€).\r\n[6]Â  See Folkens v.

Raman, of Spartanburg, for Appellant. \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tBradford Neal Martin, and Laura Wilcox Howle Teer, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This dispute arises from a car sale that failed due to poor credit.Â  The circuit court granted summary judgment for Respondent Bradshaw Automotive Group, Inc.Â  We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(2).[1]\r\n1.&nbsp; Appellant informed the salesman at Respondent Bradshaw Automotive that she had poor credit.Â  Appellant, however, omitted important information from the credit application.Â  She signed a handwritten buyerâ€™s order which specified the car to be purchased and contained an itemized price listing.Â  The buyerâ€™s order contained the following language:Â  â€œShould financing be requested, it is understood that no contractual relationship is established and the transaction will not be consummated until credit has been approved . . . .â€Â  Appellant admitted that when she signed the buyerâ€™s order she understood no contract would be established until financing was obtained.Â  Appellant next met with Respondentâ€™s finance manager and signed a typed buyerâ€™s order that contained the same conditional language.Â  Appellant also signed a â€œRetail Installment Contract and Security Agreement,â€ which recited the terms of the proposed sale and provided the details of the financing.Â  The financing contract further provided that it was to be assigned to CPS, Inc.Â  This form was not signed by representatives of either Respondent or CPS.Â  For the next two months, Respondent unsuccessfully attempted to secure financing.Â  CPS denied Appellantâ€™s application for credit.Â  No other lenders approved the application.Â  Respondent ultimately attempted to repossess the car but Appellant locked it in her backyard and brought this action against Respondent.Â \r\n \r\n2.&nbsp; We find the learned circuit court judge properly granted Respondent summary judgment and dismissed the Complaint.Â \r\n \r\nIssue I. The contract claim:Â  See Brewer v. Stokes Kia, Isuzu, Subaru, Inc., 364 S.C. 444, 449-51, 613 S.E.2d 802, 805-06 (Ct. App. 2005) (detailing a similar transaction and holding that when approval of financing is a condition precedent to the formation of the contract for sale, no duties of performance arise under the contract until financing is approved).Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nIssue II. The Truth In Lending claim:Â  The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) is a federal statute enacted to protect consumers in credit transactions.Â  Comer v. Person Auto Sales, Inc., 368 F. Supp. 2d 478, 484 (M.D.N.C. 2005).Â  Toward that end, TILA requires creditors to make accurate disclosures when extending credit such as: amount financed, itemization of amount financed, total number of payments, finance charges, annual percentage rate, and identity of the creditor.Â  See 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1638(a) (2005); Bragg v. Bill Heard Chevrolet, Inc., 374 F.3d 1060, 1065, (11th Cir. 2004); Comer, 368 F. Supp. 2d at 484.Â  Also, a customer must be informed of the right to rescind.Â  Oâ€™Brien v. Aames Funding Corp., 374 F. Supp. 2d 764, 766 (D. Minn. 2005).Â  The specific content and timing of the disclosures are set forth in Regulation Z, a Federal Reserve Board regulation.Â  Bragg, 374 F.3d at 1065.Â  Under Regulation Z, the disclosures must be made â€œbefore consummation of the transaction,â€ or â€œbefore credit is extended.â€Â  Nigh v. Koons Buick Pontiac GMC, Inc., 319 F.3d 119, 123 (4th Cir. 2003), revâ€™d on other grounds, 543 U.S. 50 (2004).Â  In Nigh, the Fourth Circuit joined many other courts in holding that consummation, for purposes of TILA, occurs when a customer signs a financing agreement that provides unilateral power for the creditor to execute the agreement at a later time.Â  Id. at 124.Â  Appellant argues that Respondent violated TILA by failing to provide her a copy of the finance agreement before it was executed by the dealership.Â  She cites no law in support of this theory.Â  Conclusory arguments without supporting authority are considered abandoned.Â  Armstrong v.

Simmons, of Pelzer, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Robert M. Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Michael Simmons appeals convictions for burglary in the first degree and three counts of attempted armed robbery.Â  Specifically, he argues the Greenville County Sheriffâ€™s Department lacked probable cause to arrest him, and that he should have been provided a preliminary hearing prior to trial.Â  We affirm. \r\n \r\nFACTS\r\nIn the early morning hours of April 30, 2003, Simmons and two other masked men broke into Tarra Hendersonâ€™s home with the intent to steal drugs and money they believed to be in the house.Â  All three men were armed with handguns. [r.31] Tarra Henderson, and her boyfriend, Torrey Brown, were in a room in the front of the residence with their one month-old child, and Donnell Hagood, a mutual friend was asleep in a back bedroom.\r\n \r\nWhen Simmons and his co-defendants entered the home, one man ordered Brown to the ground and held him at gunpoint while the other man and Simmons searched the house for drugs and money.Â  Simmons opened the oven, turned it on, and threatened to put Hendersonâ€™s baby in the oven if she did not cooperate. \r\n \r\nAt this point, Henderson yelled for Hagoodâ€™s assistance.Â  When the masked men became aware of Hagoodâ€™s presence, Simmons and the third man went into his room, frisked him, and forced him into the front room at gunpoint.\r\n \r\nWhen the first man saw Hagood, he recognized him as his cousin, took off his mask, and stopped holding Brown at gunpoint.Â  When Simmons and the other man saw this, they fled the residence.Â  Henderson called the police who ultimately arrested the intruder.Â \r\n \r\nLater, Jeremey Nash turned himself in to police and confessed to being one of the intruders who broke into Tarra Hendersonâ€™s home.Â  During Simmonsâ€™ trial, Nash testified and served as the key witness placing Simmons at the scene as one of the intruders.Â \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSimmons raises two issues in his pro se brief, both of which relate to probable cause.Â  One concern is whether the Greenville County Sheriffâ€™s Department had probable cause to arrest him, and the other asserts that he should have been granted a preliminary hearing.Â  \r\n \r\nFirst, there is no question that probable cause existed when the grand jury indicted Simmons.Â  A true billed indictment is prima facie evidence of probable cause.Â  Whitner v. Duke Power Company, 277 S.C. 397, 399, 288 S.E.2d 389, 390 (1982). Furthermore, probable cause for an arrest exists when the circumstances within the arresting officerâ€™s knowledge are sufficient to lead a reasonable person to believe that a crime has been committed by the person being arrested.Â  State v. George, 323 S.C. 496, 509, 476 S.E.2d 903, 911 (1996).Â  â€œWhether probable cause exists depends upon the totality of the circumstances surrounding the information at the officerâ€™s disposal.â€Â  Id.Â  After a review of the record, we find the Greenville County Sheriffâ€™s Department possessed probable cause to arrest Simmons.\r\nSecond, a defendant does not have a constitutional right to a preliminary hearing in South Carolina.Â  State v. Keenan, 278 S.C. 361, 296 S.E.2d 676 (1982).Â  Simmonsâ€™ indictments constituted a finding of probable cause and thus eliminated the need for a preliminary hearing.Â  State v. McClure, 277 S.C. 432, 289 S.E.2d 158 (1982).Â  Significantly, Simmonsâ€™ attorney declined to request a hearing because he felt it was clear the state had probable cause.Â  We find no error on appeal.\r\nBased on this failure to request a preliminary hearing, Simmons sought his attorneyâ€™s dismissal.Â  The trial judge properly denied this request and continued with the trial.Â  Simmons also argued throughout his brief that his trial counsel was ineffective for refusing to request a preliminary hearing.Â  However, post-conviction relief, rather than direct appeal, is the proper avenue for allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  State v. Felder, 290 S.C. 521, 351 S.E.2d 852 (1986).Â  \r\n \r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s decision is  \r\nAFFIRMED.[1]Â  \r\nBEATTY, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-133","title":"John Doe 3 v.

Meyers, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nDavid B. Betts and Jonathan Matthew Harvey, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The trial court granted DuCharmeâ€™s motion for summary judgment and dismissed Doeâ€™s action for childhood sexual abuse with prejudice.Â  On appeal, Doe argues the trial court erred in deciding his action was barred by the statute of limitations.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nDoe alleged DuCharme sexually abused him in 1986 and 1987 when he was twelve and thirteen years of age, respectively.Â  Doe admitted he did not repress the memory of the abuse, but he claimed that a causal connection between the alleged abuse and his alleged injury was not diagnosed until 2003.Â Â  \r\nDuCharme denied these allegations and moved for summary judgment claiming the statute of limitations for the cause of action had run.Â  On July 9, 2004, the trial court held a hearing to decide DuCharmeâ€™s summary judgment motion.Â  The trial court granted DuCharmeâ€™s summary judgment motion holding that Doeâ€™s cause of action arose in 1987 when he was thirteen years-old, and this cause of action became time barred when he reached his nineteenth birthday.Â  Doeâ€™s cause of action was dismissed with prejudice.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing a motion for summary judgment, the appellate court applies\r\nthe same standard of review as the trial court under Rule 56, SCRCP.Â  Cowburn v. Leventis, 366 S.C. 20, 30, 619 S.E.2d 437, 443 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Trousdell v. Cannon, 351 S.C. 636, 572 S.E.2d 264 (2002)).Â  The judgment may be affirmed only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56, SCRCP.Â Â Â  The reviewing court must consider the facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Estate of Cantrell by Cantrell v. Green, 302 S.C. 557, 559, 397 S.E.2d 777, 779 (Ct. App. 1990) (citing Stratos v. King, 282 S.C. 501, 319 S.E.2d 356 (Ct. App. 1984)). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDoe contends the trial court erred in finding his cause of action to be time barred under the statute of limitations.Â  We disagree.\r\nDoe brought suit alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress and battery under section 15-3-555 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005).Â  This statute went into effect on August 31, 2001, andÂ  provides a sexual abuse victim with three years from the date of discovery of the causal relationship between the injury and the sexual abuse to file a cause of action.Â  \r\nHowever, DuCharme moved for summary judgment based on sections 15-3-530(5) and 15-3-40 of the South Carolina Code (1976).Â  These sections of law represented the statutes of limitation governing sexual abuse causes of action prior to August 31, 2001.Â  Section 15-3-530(5) (1976) allowed a sexual abuse victim to file within six years from the date the victim knew or should have known that he had a cause of action.[2]Â  Section 15-3-40 raised exceptions to the six year statute of limitations requirement.[3]Â  More specifically, section 15-3-40 (Supp. 2005)Â  states:\r\n\r\nIf a person entitled to bring an action mentioned in Article 5 of this chapter or an action under Chapter 78 of this title, except for a penalty or forfeiture or against a sheriff or other officer for an escape, is at the time the cause of action accrued either:\r\n(1) within the age of eighteen years; or\r\n(2) insane;\r\n\r\n  the time of the disability is not a part of the time limited for the commencement of the action, except that the period within which the action must be brought cannot be extended:\r\n(a) more than five years by any such disability, except infancy; nor\r\n(b) in any case longer than one year after the disability ceases.\r\n\r\nDuCharme argued that while the statute of limitations was tolled during Doeâ€™s minority, his causes of action needed to be commenced within one year of his eighteenth birthday (not later than some time in 1993).Â  DuCharme further contended because the applicable statutes of limitation already had run sometime in 1993 prior to the August 31, 2001 effective date of the more liberal statute of limitations, Doeâ€™s cause of action was time barred.Â  \r\nThe trial court agreed with DuCharmeâ€™s argument and concluded:\r\n\r\nWhile it is certainly the authority of the legislature to establish appropriate statutes of limitations for various causes of action, it is without authority to revive a cause of action which has already become time barred at the time such new statute of limitation is enacted.\r\n\r\nThe trial court went on to state for the purposes of this matter, whether the applicable statute is deemed one of repose or limitation makes no difference.Â  \r\nDuring the pendency of this appeal, the South Carolina Supreme Court decided a case which had facts virtually identical to this matter.Â  InÂ  Doe v. Crooks, 364 S.C. 349, 613 S.E.2d 536 (2005), a thirty-four year old man was allegedly sexually abused in 1983 as a fourteen or fifteen year old child, and he admitted that his recollection of these events was not repressed.Â  He asserted that he did not realize the full extent of his injuries until 2001.\r\nThe supreme court analyzed the issue in the following manner:\r\n\r\nDiscovery occurred in 1983, when Doe was fifteen years old.Â  Under section 15-3-40(1), the limitations period was tolled until Doe reached the age of majority, eighteen. Under section 15-3-535, Doe then had six years to file his action.Â \r\nIn other words, Doe needed to file by the time he turned twenty-four. Because he failed to do so, his cause of action lapsed in 1992, nine years before section 15-3-555\r\nwas adopted. \r\n\r\nCrooks, 364 S.C. at 352-53, 613 S.E.2d at 538.\r\nThe supreme court found similarly to the trial court in holding:Â  \r\n\r\nOrdinarily, a new statute of limitations applies retroactively.Â  However, it cannot operate to revive an action for which the limitations period has already expired. Such a result would violate the defendantâ€™s rights under the Due Process Clause of the South Carolina Constitution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\r\nCrooks, 364 S.C. at 351-52, 613 S.E.2d at 538.\r\nUnder the supreme courtâ€™s analysis in Crooks, Doe would have had to file his cause of action by sometime in 1998 in order to comply with the then existing statute of limitation.Â  Doe did not file this action until 2003.Â  Therefore, under both the analysis of the trial court and the supreme courtâ€™s analysis in Crooks, Doeâ€™s action is time barred.Â  \r\nWe find the supreme courtâ€™s decision in Crooks to be controlling and dispositive of this matter.Â  Therefore, in accordance with this binding precedent, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s granting of summary judgment. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the trial courtâ€™s order is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., ANDERSON, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â Â  For actions accruing prior to April 5, 1988, the limitations period is six years in duration. The three-year limitations period now found in the Code applies to actions accruing on or after April 5, 1988.Â  Doe v. Crooks, 364 S.C. 349, 353 n.7, 613 S.E.2d 536, 538 n.7 (2005) (citing 1988 Act No. 432).Â  This action accrued in 1986; however, inserting the proper six year statute of limitation over the improper three year statute of limitation (as put forth by DuCharme) is inconsequential because the trial court set the date of expiration for the cause of action as one year from the victimâ€™s eighteenth birthday.Â  Under either statute of limitation, the cause of action expires in 1993 under the trial courtâ€™s analysis.Â  \r\n[3] There may be exceptions to these statutes of limitation for â€œrepressed memoriesâ€ of sexual abuse, but Doe admits that he did not repress his memory of the abuse.Â  â€œThat the injured party may not at that time â€˜comprehend the full extent of the damage is immaterial.â€™â€Â  Doe v. Crooks, 364 S.C. 349, 352, 613 S.E.2d 536, 538 (2005).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-134","title":"State v.

Their son Michael was born May 1, 1994, and the parties agreed Wife would be a stay-at-home\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nTwo months after Michaelâ€™s birth, the parties moved from California to Florida, where Husband attended Flight Surgeon School for his military obligation.Â  Six months later, the parties again moved, this time to Hawaii, where they remained for almost three years while Husband was a Flight Surgeon.Â  During this time, Wife continued to stay at home with Michael.Â  &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In May 1997, the parties moved to Massachusetts for Husbandâ€™s three-year residency as an Emergency Room Resident.Â  The first year, Wife continued to stay at home, taking care of Michael.Â  However, she later took a part-time position, at the hospital where Husband worked, performing secretarial work while Michael attended pre-school.Â  During the third year of Husbandâ€™s residency, Wife was pregnant again and stayed home.Â  &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The partiesâ€™ second child, Zachary, was born June 17, 2000.Â  One week later, the parties moved to Myrtle Beach, where Husband took a position as an Emergency Room Physician at Grand Strand Hospital.Â  In the summer of 2001, Melissa Schroeder, who apparently worked with Husband, began babysitting the partiesâ€™ children.Â  The following October, Husband informed Wife he no longer loved her.Â  That Thanksgiving, Wife took the children on an extended holiday visit to Colorado, and after noticing questionable activity on the partiesâ€™ checking account, returned home early to discover evidence of Husbandâ€™s possible infidelity.Â  Once confronted, Husband admitted there was â€œsomebody else in his life,â€ but denied Wife knew the person.Â  On December 1, 2001, Husband moved out of the marital home.Â  Thereafter, Wife hired a private investigator and discovered the woman Husband was having an affair with was the babysitter, Melissa Schroeder.Â  In May, 2002, Melissa Schroeder was accepted into Physicianâ€™s Assistant School at Wake Forest in North Carolina.Â  In June 2002, Husband accepted a position at Duke University in North Carolina, only eighty miles from Melissaâ€™s school.Â &nbsp;\r\n After Husband moved to North Carolina, Wife took trips there so Husband could see the children and because she believed they could put their â€œmarriage back together.â€Â  While the parties did discuss Wife moving to North Carolina to be with Husband, they never had a set plan.Â  In September 2002, Wife discovered she was pregnant.Â  She continued to visit Husband in North Carolina during her pregnancy, but found evidence Husband and Melissa were still involved in a relationship.Â  After the birth of their daughter Kylie in April 2003, the parties no longer discussed reconciliation.Â  In June 2004, Wife again hired a private investigator, who discovered evidence that Melissa spent the night in Husbandâ€™s home with the partiesâ€™ children.Â \r\nWife filed this action seeking, among other things, a divorce from Husband on the ground of adultery, custody of the children, child support, alimony, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Husband answered, admitting he committed adultery, but alleging Wife condoned his affair based upon their reconciliation.Â  The family court granted Wife a divorce on the ground of Husbandâ€™s adultery, finding the adultery was ongoing and there was no attempt at reconciliation after the last private investigative report.Â  It further awarded Wife custody of the minor children.Â  After considering all the relevant factors, the family court determined Wife was entitled to $5,000 per month in alimony, child support in the amount of $3,000 per month, and attorneyâ€™s fees, expert fees, investigative fees and costs in the amount of $12,000.Â  \r\nHusband appeals, arguing the family court judge erred in awarding Wife $5,000 a month in alimony.Â  He further asserts error in the award of $12,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees and investigative fees.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has the authority to find the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).Â  This broad scope of review does not, however, require this court to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 283, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002).Â  Rather, because the family court is in a superior position to judge the witnessesâ€™ demeanor and veracity, its findings should be given broad discretion.Â  Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Alimony Award\r\nHusband argues that, in determining the amount of alimony to award Wife, the family court committed reversible error because the award was (1) an excessive amount that was not supported by the evidence presented and (2) the amount awarded acted as a disincentive for Wife to seek employment.Â  We disagree.\r\n A.Â Â Â Â Â  Excessiveness of Award\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in awarding wife $5,000 a month in alimony because the evidence presented did not support this amount.Â  He contends, after involuntary deductions and child support and alimony payments, he is left with only $4,414 a month to cover his own expenses.Â  He further argues Wifeâ€™s financial declaration included only estimations of her monthly expenses and that these estimations were not reasonable.Â  Husband also takes issue with certain specific expenses listed by Wife on her financial declaration, including child care expenses and a loan repayment to Wifeâ€™s parents that was to be discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding the parties had pending.Â  Finally, Husband argues the family court erroneously found the parties enjoyed a high standard of living because the evidence shows the parties lived beyond their means.\r\nThe record shows Husband was receiving a gross monthly income of approximately $20,000.Â  Wife, on the other hand, has no source of income other than alimony and child support.Â  After considering the appropriate factors pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C), the family court determined Wife was entitled to monthly alimony of $5,000, approximately one-fourth of Husbandâ€™s gross income.Â  In particular, the family court noted Wifeâ€™s educational background and lack of marketable job skills, Husbandâ€™s employment as a physician and his high monthly gross income of approximately $20,000, the partiesâ€™ previous high standard of living, Husbandâ€™s fault in the break-up of the marriage which significantly impacted the economic circumstances, Husbandâ€™s move to North Carolina which forced the parties to file for bankruptcy, and the beneficial tax consequence of alimony to Husband.Â  The family court further found Wifeâ€™s financial declaration reflected â€œfair and appropriate, actual as well as estimated monthly expenses for herself and the childrenâ€ of some $8,215 per month.Â  \r\nAn award of alimony rests within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Craig v. Craig, 365 S.C. 285, 292, 617 S.E.2d 359, 362 (2005).Â  The purpose of an alimony award is to serve as a substitute for the support which is normally incident to the marital relationship, thereby placing the supported spouse, as nearly as practical, in the same position he or she enjoyed during the marriage.Â  Id.Â  â€œThe family court has broad discretion in determining the amount of permanent alimony, and there is no single, fixed standard to use in making that determination.â€Â  Rimer v. Rimer, 361 S.C. 521, 525, 605 S.E.2d 572, 574 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œIt is the duty of the court to make an award of alimony that is fit, equitable, and just if the claim is well-founded.â€Â  Doe v. Doe, 324 S.C. 492, 504, 478 S.E.2d 854, 860 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nFactors to be considered in making an alimony award include:Â  (1) duration of the marriage; (2) physical and emotional health of the parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4) employment history and earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living established during the marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the parties; (7) current and reasonably anticipated expenses of the parties; (8) marital and nonmarital properties of the parties; (9) custody of children; (10) marital misconduct or fault; (11) tax consequences; and (12) prior support obligations; as well as (13) other factors the court considers relevant.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2005).Â  No one factor is dispositive.Â  Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 184, 554 S.E.2d 421, 425 (Ct. App. 2001). \r\nIn this case, the family court carefully considered and made written findings on all thirteen factors enumerated in section 20-3-130(C).Â  Based on the record before us, we find this award is supported by the evidence and therefore the family court did not abuse its discretion in awarding Wife $5,000 a month in alimony.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Â Â Â  Alimony as a Disincentive\r\nHusband next argues the family court erred in awarding $5,000 a month in alimony as it acts as a disincentive for Wife to seek employment or a better education.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe family court found, and the record supports, Wife has a limited education and a sporadic work history that has left her with no marketable job skills.Â  Further, the family court found, as testified to by Wife, if Wife were to obtain employment, her earnings would not cover the costs she would incur in child care.Â  The family court also determined the parties made a joint decision that Wife would primarily be a homemaker.Â  This finding is supported by the testimony of Wife that, once she was expecting their first child, the parties agreed it was in the best interest of the children that Wife stay home with them.Â  Further, Husband himself testified the parties agreed it would be best for the children for Wife to stay home with the children â€œwhile [they] were in school.â€Â  Accordingly, we find the family court did not abuse its discretion in its award of alimony.\r\n\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in awarding Wife a full reimbursement of $10,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees and $2,000 in investigative fees.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court should consider the following factors:Â  (1) the partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fee; (2) the beneficial results obtained by the attorney; (3) the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions; and (4) the effect of the attorneyâ€™s fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  In determining the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees to award, the court should consider (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case, (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case, (3) counselâ€™s professional standing, (4) the contingency of compensation, (5) the beneficial results obtained, and (6) the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).Â  \r\nHusband contends, while the family court made findings pursuant to the Glasscock factors, it failed to consider all of the factors as raised by the evidence.Â  Specifically, Husband asserts error in the family courtâ€™s failure to recognize that, after his support payment of $8,000 a month, he will not be in a position to pay Wifeâ€™s fees, and his own standard of living will be detrimentally affected by the award.Â  \r\nThe family court expressly considered the above factors in making the award of fees and costs.Â  In particular, the court noted Husbandâ€™s misconduct was the cause of the break-up of the marriage, Wifeâ€™s standard of living would be impacted and it would create a financial hardship on her if she were required to pay the fees, Husband earns a substantial income, placing him in a better position to pay the fees, and Wife obtained beneficial results.Â  The court also found Wifeâ€™s attorney to be in good professional standing, the fees charged were comparable to those charged in the community, and the amount of time devoted to the case was reasonable based upon the nature and difficulty of the matter.Â  Under the facts and circumstances of this case, particularly Husbandâ€™s superior earning capacity, his fault in the break-up of the marriage and the resulting impact on Wifeâ€™s financial condition, and the beneficial results obtained by Wifeâ€™s attorney, we find no abuse of discretion in the award.Â  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the family court is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-137","title":"State v.

Johnson and Bonnie T. Hunt, of Charleston; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â  Wateree Community Actions, Inc. (also referred to as the Agency) appeals a judgment in a retaliatory discharge action, arguing the plaintiff, Coralen Montgomery, failed to effect service of process.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn December 4, 2001, Montgomery was fired from her employment as a bus driver and custodian with Wateree Head Start, a division of Wateree Community Actions, Inc., after leaving a child unattended on her bus at the end of her route.Â  In the letter of termination sent to Montgomery, Georgia M. Mance, the Head Start director, cited as the reason for Montgomeryâ€™s discharge her failure to follow certain program policies established to prevent such hazards.\r\nMontgomery appealed her termination in accordance with the Agencyâ€™s internal grievance procedures.Â  Although the Agency acknowledged receipt of her appeal and scheduled a hearing with the Head Start Policy Council Grievance Committee, the hearing was postponed twice at the request of Montgomeryâ€™s attorney.Â  On January 31, 2002, after the second postponement, Mance wrote to Montgomery advising that, because the Head Start Office had not heard from her since her attorney made the second request for a continuance, her appeal had â€œbecome void for lack of timely communication and not following through on an appeal which [she] requested.â€Â  Mance further informed Montgomery the Head Start Policy Council â€œcontinue[d] to uphold its actionâ€ and any further pursuit of her appeal should be done in writing and sent to Rubye J. Johnson, the Agencyâ€™s executive director, at a post office box address in Sumter.Â  Apparently, however, Montgomery did not continue her appeal within the Agency.\r\nOn May 22, 2002, Montgomery filed a summons and complaint against the Agency for wrongful discharge.Â  In her pleadings, Montgomery alleged the Agency had fired her in retaliation for a workersâ€™ compensation claim she had filed.Â  Montgomeryâ€™s attorney served the pleadings by certified mail, return receipt requested.Â  According to the return receipt card, the pleadings were delivered on May 31, 2002, to 116 E. Canal Street, Sumter, SCÂ  29150, and were accepted by Howard Parnell, an employee of the Agencyâ€™s weatherization program.Â  The pleadings were never delivered to Mance, Johnson, or any other person authorized by the Agency to accept service of process.\r\nOn July 12, 2002, Montgomery moved for default judgment and requested a damages hearing in the case.Â  According to the cover letter, Montgomeryâ€™s attorney sent the notice of the default hearing to 13 South Main Street, Sumter, SCÂ  29150, the correct address for the Agencyâ€™s main administrative offices.Â  Upon receiving the notice, Rubye Johnson contacted the Agency attorney.Â  \r\nIn its brief to this court, the Agency stated that, at the hearing on Montgomeryâ€™s motion for default, her attorney presented (1) proof of service as evidenced by the return receipt signed by Parnell and the cover letter to the Agency, with which the summons and complaint were enclosed; (2) a document purporting to show that, according to the records maintained by the South Carolina Secretary of State, the Agencyâ€™s registered agent information was listed as â€œPrinciple [sic] Office, 116 E. Canal Street, Sumter, South Carolina.â€Â  Counsel for the Agency presented a letter its attorney had received from Johnson, the executive director, averring (1) neither she nor anyone else at the administrative offices had received the pleadings, and (2) the agency had been located at the 13 South Main Street address since the mid-1980s.Â  In the letter, Johnson further stated (1) the Canal Street address where the summons and complaint were mailed was now the parking lot for the Sumter County Public Library; (2) the building that the Agency used at that address had been demolished in the 1970s; (3) Parnell was the director of the Agencyâ€™s weatherization program and his office was located at 316 South Harvin Street, Sumter, South Carolina; and (4) Parnell did not recall signing for any certified mail addressed to the Agency.\r\nOn August 27, 2003, the trial court filed an order finding the Agency to be in default.Â  In the order, the trial court also found Montgomery entitled to â€œJudgment by default on all causes of action as plead [sic] in the Complaint, and for all damages set forth in the Complaintâ€ and stated it would set a damages hearing.\r\nAt a nonjury damages hearing on August 4, 2004, the trial court awarded Montgomery a judgment of $24,140 against the Agency.Â  The Agency appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, the Agency argues the trial court erred in granting Montgomeryâ€™s motion for default judgment, contending (1) the judgment was void because service of process was ineffective under Rule 4(d)(8) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure in that the delivery was not restricted to the addressee; (2) there was no evidence that Parnell was an officer or manager of the Agency or otherwise authorized to accept service of process on its behalf; and (3) Montgomery herself acknowledged at the damages hearing that she had known for eleven years the Agencyâ€™s main office was on South Main Street, but could not explain why the summons and complaint were sent to the Canal Street address.Â  These arguments, however, when evaluated in conjunction with the record before us, are insufficient to reverse the default judgment.\r\nRule 4 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, which governs service of process on defendants in civil actions, serves two purposes, one of which is to confer personal jurisdiction on the court over the defendant.[2]Â  â€œObjections to personal jurisdiction, unlike subject matter jurisdiction, are waived unless raised.â€[3]Â  â€œFor good cause shown the court may set aside an entry of default and, if a judgment by default has been entered, may likewise set it aside in accordance with Rule 60(b).â€[4]Â  \r\nâ€œIt is well settled that, but for a very few exceptional circumstances, an appellate court cannot address an issue unless it was raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.â€[5]Â  Furthermore, â€œ[t]he appellant has the burden of providing this court with a sufficient record upon which to make a decision.â€[6]\r\nThe Agency alleged in its brief that, during the course of the default hearing, it submitted a letter from Rubye Johnson regarding its correct location and Parnellâ€™s status as an employee.Â  The record, however, does not contain a transcript of this hearing.Â  Furthermore, even if we were give the Agency the benefit of the doubt and assume for the purpose of this appeal that it moved to set aside the entry of default and raised these issues to the trial court, neither the order issued pursuant to this hearing nor the order issued after the damages hearing ruled on either of these arguments.Â  Under these circumstances, we hold there is no basis on which we can reverse the default judgment against the Agency.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issue on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Moore v.

Tzerman, Master -Â  In - Equity\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-147\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2006 â€“ Filed March 13, 2006Â Â Â \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAlan Martin Stewart, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nJohn K. DeLoach, Jr., of Camden, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this appeal, Midfirst Bank argues the master-in-equity erred in declining to exercise subject matter jurisdiction over the bankâ€™s foreclosure action.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nJessie Banks died in September of 2003.Â  On November 14, 2003, the Kershaw County Probate Court took â€œexclusive original jurisdiction over all subject matter related toâ€ the estate and appointed Pierce C. Newman as the estateâ€™s personal representative.Â  \r\nIn February of 2004, Midfirst Bank commenced a foreclosure action against real estate owned by the deceased.Â  Meanwhile, the personal representative determined that the real estate needed to be sold in order to pay for funeral expenses, costs of administration, and debts of the estate, so he filed a petition, lis pendens, and a proposed contract for sale with the probate court.Â  On May 4, 2004, Midfirst Bankâ€™s attorney was served with the probate pleadings, together with notification that a hearing on the matter was to be held on May 25, 2004.Â  The attorney neither responded to the petition nor appeared at the hearing.\r\nThe probate court issued an order on May 27, 2004, approving the sale and authorizing the proceeds to be disbursed as follows: first, to the payment of funeral expenses; second, to the costs of administration; and third, to the mortgage on the property.Â  After paying the burial and administration expenses, there was only about $15,000 available to Midfirst Bank, an amount which did not satisfy the mortgage.Â  In conjunction with its order, the probate court signed a release, freeing the real estate from the lien of Midfirst Bankâ€™s mortgage.Â  Midfirst Bank did not appeal from the probate court order, and on June 29, 2004, the personal representative closed the sale.Â Â  \r\nMidfirst Bankâ€™s foreclosure action lingered, however, and the matter was referred to a master-in-equity, who held a hearing on July 13, 2004.Â  The master declined to exercise subject matter jurisdiction over the case because the unappealed probate court order disposed of the property and disbursed the proceeds generated from the sale.Â  The master found service of the probate proceedings upon Midfirst Bankâ€™s attorneys was sufficient and any issues it had with regard to the sale of the property should have been raised to the probate court.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n In an action at law referred to a master with direct appeal to the supreme court or court of appeals, the appellate court will correct errors of law but must affirm the masterâ€™s factual findings unless there is no evidence supporting the findings. Â Sea Cabins on the Ocean IV Homeowners Assâ€™n, Inc. v. City of North Myrtle Beach, 337 S.C. 380, 388, 523 S.E.2d 193, 197 (Ct. App. 1999) affâ€™d in result by, 345 S.C. 418, 548 S.E.2d 595 (2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMidfirst Bank argues it was never properly served with notice of the probate court matter.Â  We disagree.\r\nPursuant to section 62-1-401 of the South Carolina Code (1987), notice of a hearing in the probate court can be served on a partyâ€™s attorney if the party so requests or if the party â€œhas appeared by attorney.â€Â  Here, the personal representative notified Midfirst Bank of the hearing by serving the Korn Law Firm, which was representing the bank in its foreclosure action.Â Â Â Â  Midfirst Bank argues it only authorized the Korn Law Firm to represent it in the foreclosure action, and therefore, service to the law firm in the probate matter was insufficient.Â  We find no merit to this argument.\r\nThe Korn Law Firm was hired to collect Midfirst Bankâ€™s debt, and because of that debt, the personal representative had to notify Midfirst Bank of all probate court proceedings relating to the property on which the bank had a lien.Â  Thus, the Korn Law Firmâ€™s representation of Midfirst Bank was not exclusively limited to the proceedings in circuit court, but with all matters affecting the bankâ€™s foreclosure action.Â  We therefore agree with the masterâ€™s finding that service of the probate proceedings upon Midfirst Bankâ€™s attorneys was sufficient.\r\nMidfirst Bank also argues that even though the property was disposed of under the probate laws of South Carolina, it could still be subject to any encumbrances present at the decedentâ€™s death.Â  While section 62-3-1312 of the South Carolina Code (1987) does allow the probate court to sell land subject to any existing lien, that section also allows the court to file a release of the lien.Â  Here, the probate court filed such a release after ordering the property sold.Â  Midfirst Bank never appealed from this order; thus, the order selling the property and releasing it from the bankâ€™s lien is the law of the case.Â  See In re Thames, 344 S.C. 564, 573 n.3, 544 S.E.2d 854, 858 n.3 (Ct. App. 2001) (explaining that an unappealed decision of a trial court, right or wrong, is the law of the case). Any objections Midfirst Bank has with regard to how the proceeds of the sale should have been disbursed needed to be lodged before the probate court released the property from its lien.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the master-in-equityâ€™s order declining to exercise subject matter jurisdiction is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-148","title":"State v.

Pleasant, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is a pro se appeal from a decision of the Marion County School District Seven (school board) to terminate Moodyâ€™s employment as a teacher.Â  The circuit court affirmed the school boardâ€™s decision, finding substantial evidence in the record of her unfitness as a teacher.Â  Additionally, the circuit court found no procedural errors.Â  On appeal, Moody asserts that her procedural due process rights were violated in certain respects.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Moody first argues that her procedural due process rights were violated in that the school board suspended her without notice and a hearing.Â  We find this argument not properly preserved for appeal.Â  See Elam v. South Carolina Dept. of Transp.,&nbsp;361 S.C. 9, 23-24, 602 S.E.2d 772, 779-780&nbsp;(2004) (holding that for an argument to be preserved for appeal, it must be raised to and ruled on by the trial court).Â  On the merits, we affirm pursuant to the following authority:Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-25-450 (2004) (providing that a superintendent may suspend a teacher without notice and a hearing, provided the letter includes the cause for suspension and notification that a hearing before the board is available if requested within 15 days).Â  Moody does not argue that she failed to receive notice of the dismissal hearing.Â  See McWhirter v. Cherokee County School Dist. 1, 274 S.C. 66, 67-68, 261 S.E.2d 157, 158 (1979) (holding that defective notice as to the suspension hearing was irrelevant when the dismissal hearing, not the suspension hearing, was the subject of the appeal).Â  \r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  We find Moodyâ€™s argument to the effect that failure to comply with the 15-day requirement for holding the hearing under section 59-25-470 deprived the school board of jurisdiction to be without merit.Â  It does not appear in the record that Moody ever objected to this defect.Â  Thus, the only question before us is whether failure to hold the hearing within 15 days deprived the school board of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  See State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 100, 610 S.E.2d 494, 498 (2005) (holding that issues related to subject matter jurisdiction may not be waived and may be raised at any time).Â  We hold that the 15-day requirement is mandatory, but not jurisdictional, pursuant to the following authorities:Â  Johnston v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation, S.C. Real Estate Appraisers Bd., 365, S.C. 293, 617 S.E.2d 363 (2005) (holding that a provision requiring the Board to serve notice of its decision within 30 days was mandatory, but not jurisdictional); Gentry, 363 S.C. at 100, 610 S.E.2d at 498 (holding that subject matter jurisdiction is broadly defined as the power of a court to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong).Â  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., ANDERSON, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-151","title":"Moyers v.

Bonham, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Mark Moyers, a chiropractor licensed to practice in South Carolina, was convicted of willful failure to file state income tax returns in violation of section 12-54-40(b)(6)(C) of the South Carolina Code (1976)[1] for the years of 1994, 1995, and 1996.Â  As a result of this conviction, the South Carolina Board of Chiropractic Examiners (the Board) found Moyers violated certain provisions of the South Carolina Chiropractic Practice Act and imposed on Moyers a $750 fine, plus cost to be determined, and placed his chiropractic license on probation for one year.Â  The Administrative Law Judge affirmed.Â  The circuit court dismissed his appeal. Moyers now argues the Board acted without subject matter jurisdiction, and the circuit court erred in dismissing his appeal. Â We affirm.[2]Â  \r\n1.Â Â All arguments raised by Moyers are merely conclusory statements. Consequently, Moyers abandoned his issues on appeal, and we need not consider them.Â  See Medical Univ. of South Carolina v. Arnaud, 360 S.C. 615, 620, 602 S.E.2d 747, 750 (2004) (failure to provide arguments or supporting authority for an issue renders it abandoned); Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 298-99, 519 S.E.2d 583, 600 (Ct. App. 1999) (conclusory arguments may be treated as abandoned). \r\n2.Â Â Moyersâ€™ arguments fail on the merits as a matter of law.Â  First, the Board clearly had subject matter jurisdiction.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 40-9-30, 40-9-31, and 40-9-90 (2001).Â  Second, the circuit court was acting as an appellate court when it reviewed the Boardâ€™s decision.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380 (2005); S.C. Depâ€™t of Motor Vehicles v. Nelson, 364 S.C. 514, 519, 613 S.E.2d 544, 547 (Ct. App. 2005) (â€œIn reviewing a final decision of an administrative agency, the circuit court essentially sits as an appellate court to review alleged errors committed by the agency.â€) (citing Kiawah Resort Assocs. v. South Carolina Tax Commâ€™n, 318 S.C. 502, 505, 458 S.E.2d 542, 544 (1995)).Â  Accordingly, the circuit court properly dismissed Moyersâ€™ appeal because he was not entitled to the relief he sought â€“ for example, a de novo trial.Â  Â \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., ANDERSON and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â This section has subsequently been repealed, and the pertinent language is currently in section 12-54-44.Â  See 1999 Act No. 114, Â§ 4 (eff.

Babb, of Sumter, for Appellant.\r\nHarry C. Wilson, Jr., of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Robert Horsey (Husband) appeals the family courtâ€™s order modifying his divorce settlement agreement with his former wife, Bonnie Horsey (Wife).Â  Husband claims the family court did not have jurisdiction to modify the agreement because it was only modifiable with the consent of both Husband and Wife expressed in a writing signed by both.Â  We reverse. \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife married on July 1, 1978.Â  The parties separated in 2000 and have since lived separate and apart.Â  On January 24, 2001, the couple entered into a separation and marital settlement agreement (Agreement).Â  On February 6, 2001, the family court approved the Agreement, finding it met the test of reasonableness, and declared that â€œit should be approved and made the order of this Court.â€Â  The Agreement provided it â€œshall not be modified or changed except by mutual consent and agreement of the parties expressed in a writing signed by both.â€Â  The Agreement further provided â€œthe provisions of this Agreement providing for the division and distribution of property, the allocation of responsibility for payment of marital debts, and the provisions for alimony shall be permanent, nonmodifiable, and shall not thereafter be modified by any court.â€Â  Additionally, the Agreement stated â€œany willful failure to perform or fulfill the obligations and responsibilities herein imposed will subject the offending party to a proceeding for contempt of Court.â€Â  \r\nWife instituted an action for divorce and moved to set aside the Agreement on the grounds of Rule 60, SCRCP.Â  The family court consolidated the divorce action and Rule 60 motion and set the matter for hearing.Â  The parties subsequently agreed to modify the Agreement to settle the Rule 60 motion, but proceeded to a hearing on the divorce.Â  On January 14, 2001, the family court issued an order granting the parties a divorce, incorporating and approving the modifications to the Agreement.Â  Both partiesâ€™ attorneys signed the order on their clientâ€™s behalf.Â  None of the provisions regarding modification were altered.Â  \r\nOn July 24, 2002, Husband filed a complaint for contempt, asserting Wife was in material breach of the Agreement.Â  Wife filed a counterclaim asserting it was Husband who had breached the Agreement.Â  A hearing date was set and depositions were scheduled.Â  When the parties arrived for the depositions, they decided to try to reach a settlement before taking the depositions.Â  After approximately two and a half hours of negotiations, the parties agreed to modify the original Agreement to settle the issues raised in their contempt pleadings.Â  Thereafter, the parties engaged the stenographer, who was there to record the depositions, and Wifeâ€™s attorney recited the terms of the settlement aloud for the record.Â  Husbandâ€™s attorney agreed on the record that the modifications, as stated by Wifeâ€™s attorney, were accurate, and both Husband and Wife stated that they agreed to the settlement.Â  The parties also agreed to obtain a court order incorporating the modifications to their Agreement.Â  \r\nThe parties did not immediately submit a final consent order to the family court judge to settle the contempt matter.Â  When thirty days passed since the contempt matter was to be heard, the family court judge issued an Interim Final Order.Â  In that order, the family court judge stated that although the parties reached a settlement, certain portions of the settlement required the interaction of third parties, and the he gave the parties thirty days to consummate the agreement so that he could issue a final order.Â  \r\nOver the next few months, the parties tried to reduce the on-the-record settlement to a written order that could be submitted to the family court.Â  However, the parties came to an impasse because Wife took the position that the modifications were final, and Husband contended there were executory provisions in the settlement the parties could not consummate.Â  On June 2, 2004, Wife served Husband with a Motion to Compel Agreement seeking enforcement of the settlement pursuant to the terms set out in the transcript.Â  Wife also advised Husband by letter that depositions would be limited to questions on the enforcement of the Agreement.Â  Husband disagreed with this limitation and stated his intention to seek clarification from the family court if Wife insisted on the limitation.Â  \r\nAt an in-camera meeting, the family court judge advised the parties to prepare for â€œfull blown depositionsâ€ on all issues, but told them that if he reached a different conclusion after reviewing the Interim Final Order and the transcript of the on-the-record settlement, he would notify the parties.Â  Before depositions began, the family court found there had been a meeting of the minds which constituted a binding modification of the Agreement.Â  The family court issued a ruling granting Wifeâ€™s Motion to Compel Agreement and a Final Order outlining the modifications of the Agreement pursuant to the terms contained in the on-the-record settlement.Â  \r\nHusband made a motion to reconsider, claiming the family court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to modify the Agreement, denied his procedural due process rights, and abused its discretion.Â  The family court heard arguments on the matter and, on January 19, 2005, issued an order denying Husbandâ€™s motion to reconsider.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œOn appeal from a family court order, this Court has authority to correct errors of law and find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â \r\nE.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 473, 415 S.E.2d 812, 814 (1992) (citing Rutherford v. Rutherford, 414 S.E.2d 157 (1992).Â  â€œThe jurisdiction of a court over the subject matter of a proceeding is determined by the Constitution, the laws of the state, and is fundamental.â€Â  Anderson v. Anderson,&nbsp;299 S.C. 110, 115, 382 S.E.2d 897, 900&nbsp;(1989) (citations omitted).Â  â€œLack of subject matter jurisdiction may not be waived, even by consent of the parties, and should be taken notice of by this Court.â€Â  Id.Â \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHusband claims the family court lacked the jurisdiction to modify the Agreement of the parties.Â  We agree.\r\nA property and/or an alimony agreement, unambiguously stipulating that the terms may not be may not be altered, binds the court, as well as the\r\nparties, to those terms.Â  Croom v. Croom, 305 S.C. 158, 161, 406 S.E.2d 381, 383 (Ct. App. 1991) (citing\r\nMoseley v. Mosier, 279 S.C. 348, 353, 306 S.E.2d 624, 627 (1983)).Â  The family court does not have jurisdiction to modify an agreement by its own authority or at the behest of only one of the parties if the agreement contains language divesting the court of jurisdiction.Â  Degenhart v. Burriss, 360 S.C. 497, 500-01, 602 S.E.2d 96, 97 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Although a written contract may be orally modified, notwithstanding a provision in the contract barring oral modification,\r\nwhere a contract has been merged into a court order, and the order contains a provision barring oral modification, any oral modification is unenforceable.Â  Messer v. Messer, 359 S.C. 614, 634-35, 598 S.E.2d 310, 321 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nIn the instant case, the Agreement, merged into the family courtâ€™s order, unambiguously provides it can only be modified by mutual consent in a writing signed by both parties.Â  Our review of the record clearly reveals both parties agreed to modifications of the Agreement by voicing their assent on the record, and Husband asserted he â€œabsolutelyâ€ agreed.Â Â  However, this court is bound by language in the partiesâ€™ original Agreement, divesting the family court of subject matter jurisdiction to modify its terms.Â  Because the settlement was not signed by either party, the Agreementâ€™s modification terms were not met.Â  Therefore, the settlement did not constitute a binding modification of the Agreement.Â  Because the family court did not have jurisdiction to modify the Agreement by its own authority, the family court erred in incorporating the modifications contained in the on-the-record settlement in its order.Â  Accordingly, the order of the family court is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-163","title":"State v.

Haskins (Gladys) and granting Gladys a divorce from Ray.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe parties met in the early 1980â€™s and became involved in a relationship in 1988.Â  Gladys testified that in August 1988, she and Ray went to the beach and Ray purchased wedding rings.Â  According to Gladys, when they came back, Ray told everyone they got married at the beach.Â  Thereafter, the parties lived together until January 5, 2004.Â  During this time, they put their money together, maintained joint checking accounts, and paid bills together.Â  Gladys submitted into evidence a Brendleâ€™s credit card in the name of â€œGladys Tidwellâ€ as well as some checks showing an account listed as â€œGladys J. Haskins or Lynn R. Tidwell.â€Â  The credit card showed it was issued in May 1990 and the checks were written in 1991 and 1992.Â  Gladys also testified she and Ray obtained an automobile insurance policy together, and she submitted insurance cards for the policy showing effective dates of 2003 and 2004.Â  Finally, Gladys submitted into evidence mail she and Ray received in December 2003. One was a Christmas card envelope from Rayâ€™s daughter and son-in-law addressed to â€œRay and Mousey Tidwell.â€[1]Â  The other was from Gladysâ€™ cousin and was addressed to â€œGladys and Ray Tidwell.â€Â  Gladys stated she told people she was in a relationship with Ray and they were â€œlike as one.â€Â  She testified Ray also said they were â€œas one as a coupleâ€ and â€œwere together like one person,â€ and he continued to refer to them this way to other people after 1995.Â  Ray obtained a license plate that read â€œAS ONE,â€ and Ray told Gladys it meant she and Ray were â€œas one person.â€Â  She believed their relationship was the same as marriage.Â  \r\nIn March 1991, Ray had a will made out indicating his â€œintent to marry Gladys Haskins at some subsequent date.â€Â  Gladys testified she had a similar will drawn at the time.Â  In August 1991, when Ray was in jail, he asked Gladys to draw up a document indicating she was his common-law wife so they could have conjugal visits.Â  Gladys signed a notarized document stating she and Ray had been living together as common-law husband and wife since June 1988.Â  \r\nOn March 5, 1995, Gladys obtained a divorce from Donald Haskins, whom she had married in April 1963 and from whom she had been separated since December 1976.Â  Gladys testified that Ray paid for her divorce because â€œhe was tired of [her] being married to Donald.â€Â  She believed she was common-law married to Ray before her divorce, as well as after her divorce from Donald.Â  Gladys claimed she held herself out as being married to Ray after the divorce and everyone thought they were married.Â  She stated she wore her wedding rings and that Ray also wore his on occasion, continuing to do so after 1995.Â  \r\nGladys admitted she had filled out paperwork, both before and after 1995, indicating she was single or unmarried.Â  At a social security disability hearing in 1999, Gladys identified Ray as her boyfriend.Â  She also listed Ray as her boyfriend on bank account records in 2003, as well as a loan application in 2004.Â  The record reflects Gladys further identified Ray as her boyfriend during numerous hospital admissions in 1998 and 1999.Â  Gladys testified she listed herself as single because she believed she had to be married with a license and â€œin front of a preacherâ€ or in a church in order to list herself as married on the documents.Â  Gladys denied that she and Ray had lived in separate residences, stating they had â€œalways lived together.â€Â  \r\nGladys presented the testimony of two others to support her position.Â  Her daughter, Donna Callen, testified that the parties lived together and purchased wedding rings.Â  Donna stated that about ten years ago both Gladys and Ray told her that they had gotten married.Â  She stated that, over the past ten years, she had not heard Ray say â€œdirectlyâ€ that they were married, but Ray referred to Gladys as his wife or his old lady, and he continued to do this until the parties separated.Â  Ray and Gladys participated in family get-togethers, including Fatherâ€™s Day, and he told Donna he loved her like a daughter â€œall the time.â€Â  She further stated her own children called him â€œGrandpa Rayâ€ and that Ray never objected or told the children he was not their grandfather.Â  Donna heard Ray refer to himself and Gladys â€œas one,â€ telling Donna that they would â€œalways be together as one.â€Â  Tina Floyd also testified on behalf of Gladys.Â  She stated that from 1991 to halfway through 1995 Ray, who was a childhood friend of her husband, would come into their store/bar to speak to her husband.Â  When he was there, Tina, referring to Gladys, would ask where his wife or his old lady was and he would answer her.Â  Ray never objected to Tina referring to Gladys as his wife, and he never indicated she was his girlfriend and not his wife.Â  Although Ray himself never used the term â€œwife,â€ he did refer to Gladys as his â€œold lady,â€ which Tina understood to be his wife.Â  \r\nRay testified he was never married to Gladys and never held himself out as being married to her.Â  He claimed in June 2003, he was living in a garage apartment on the same property as the mobile home where Gladys lived.Â  Ray admitted Gladys stayed with him sometimes, and that he would stay with her when she was ill so he could take care of her, but claimed he usually slept on the couch when she was sick.Â  Ray denied that he paid for Gladysâ€™ divorce in 1995 and testified he did not care if she obtained one.Â  He stated he had a license plate on his vehicle that read â€œAS ONE,â€ but claimed it did not refer to him and Gladys, and meant only that he considered himself as one.Â  Ray also denied ever getting any wedding rings at the beach or giving a wedding ring to Gladys.Â  He stated their relationship continued after Gladysâ€™ divorce in 1995 as it had been prior to the divorce, sharing expenses, having sex, having car insurance together, and him referring to her as his â€œold ladyâ€ on occasion.Â  He further admitted his license plate read â€œAS ONEâ€ after 1995.Â  \r\nThe family court determined Gladys met her burden in establishing a common law marriage between the parties.Â  The court found as follows:Â  (1) the preponderance of evidence showed Ray not only knew about Gladysâ€™ divorce from her former husband, but encouraged her to obtain the divorce and helped her pay for it; (2) after the divorce, the parties continued to live together as they did prior to the divorce; (3) the parties lived together from 1988 until January 2004; (4) Ray referred to the couple â€œas oneâ€ and the cohabitation was apparently matrimonial; (5) Ray referred to Gladys as his â€œold ladyâ€ and never took any action to negate the strong presumption in favor of marriage; (6) the parties treated each other as husband and wife; and (7) Gladysâ€™ statements that they were not married referred to her belief that a ceremonial marriage was necessary for them to be legally married and were not made with the idea of negating the presumption of marriage.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe issue of whether a common-law marriage exists is a question of law, and this courtâ€™s review is therefore limited to a determination of whether the trial judgeâ€™s findings are supported by any evidence.Â  Callen v. Callen, 365 S.C. 618, 623, 620 S.E.2d 59, 62 (2005).Â  The question is not what conclusion this court might reach after reviewing the facts, but whether the facts as found by the trial judge are supported by the evidence.Â  Id. at 629, 620 S.E.2d at 65 (Toal, C.J., dissenting); Tarnowski v. Lieberman, 348 S.C. 616, 619, 560 S.E.2d 438, 440 (Ct. App. 2002).Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nRay contends the family court erred in holding Gladys sustained her burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence (1) the existence of a new mutual agreement to enter into a common-law marriage after Gladysâ€™ divorce from Donald and (2) the existence of a common-law marriage.Â  He argues the majority of Gladysâ€™ evidence concerns the time period in which she was married to Donald, and that this evidence must be disregarded.Â  He maintains the evidence offered after the impediment to marriage was removed is insufficient to prove a common-law marriage, it fails to show a new agreement between the parties, and that the record is devoid of evidence of a mutual intent of the parties to enter a common-law marriage.Â  He further asserts the evidence he presented is sufficient to overcome any presumption of matrimony.\r\nThe party claiming the existence of a common-law marriage must prove the same by the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Callen v. Callen, 365 S.C. 618, 623, 620 S.E.2d 59, 62 (2005); Kirby v. Kirby, 270 S.C. 137, 140, 241 S.E.2d 415, 416 (1978).Â  In South Carolina, a common-law marriage is formed when two parties contract to be married.Â  Callen, 365 S.C. at 624, 620 S.E.2d at 62.Â  Essential to a common-law marriage is a mutual agreement between the parties to assume the relation of husband and wife.Â  Tarnowski v. Lieberman, 348 S.C. 616, 619, 560 S.E.2d 438, 440 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œThe fact finder is to look for mutual assent:Â  the intent of each party to be married to the other and a mutual understanding of each partyâ€™s intent.â€Â  Callen, 365 S.C. at 624, 620 S.E.2d at 62.\r\n\r\nA party need not understand every nuance of marriage or divorce law, but he must at least know that his actions will render him married as that word is commonly understood.Â  If a party does not comprehend that his â€œintentions and actionsâ€ will bind him in a â€œlegally binding marital relationship,â€ then he lacks intent to be married.Â  A lack of intent to be married overrides the presumption of marriage that arises from cohabitation and reputation.Â  South Carolina does not impose marriage upon a couple merely because they intend to be together forever.\r\n\r\nId. at 626, 620 S.E.2d at 63 (citation omitted).Â Â  \r\nDirect evidence of the requisite intent, such as public declaration by the parties of their entering into a contract of marriage, may not be readily available.Â  Barker v. Barker, 330 S.C. 361, 367, 499 S.E.2d 503, 507 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Thus, no express contract is required.Â  Rather, the agreement may be inferred from the circumstances.Â  Callen, 365 S.C. at 624, 620 S.E.2d at 62.\r\n\r\nThe difference between marriage and concubinage in the circumstances stated rests in the intent of the cohabiting parties; the physical and temporal accompaniments of the cohabitation may be the same in both cases, but the intent in the two cases is widely apart always.Â  The intent in marriage is usually evidenced by a public and unequivocal declaration of the parties, but that is not necessary; the intent may exist though never public and formally declared; nevertheless the intent must exist.Â  . . .Â  It is true that when the intent has not been formally and publicly declared, . . .Â  it may yet rest in circumstances.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nKirby, 270 S.C. at 140, 241 S.E.2d at 416 (quoting Tedder v. Tedder, 108 S.C. 271, 276, 94 S.E. 19, 20 (1917)).\r\nThere is a strong presumption in favor of marriage by cohabitation, apparently matrimonial, coupled with social acceptance over a long period of time.Â  Tarnowski, 348 S.C. at 620, 560 S.E.2d at 440; Barker v. Barker, 330 at 367, 499 S.E.2d at 506; Owens v. Owens, 320 S.C. 543, 545, 466 S.E.2d 373, 375 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Thus, â€œwhen the proponent proves that the parties participated in â€˜apparently matrimonialâ€™ cohabitation, and that while cohabiting the parties had a reputation in the community as being married, a rebuttable presumption arises that a common-law marriage was created.â€Â  Callen, 365 S.C. at 624, 620 S.E.2d at 62 (citing Jeanes v. Jeanes, 255 S.C. 161, 166-67, 177 S.E.2d 537, 539-40 (1970)).Â  â€œThis presumption may be overcome by â€˜strong, cogentâ€™ evidence that the parties in fact never agreed to marry.â€Â  Id.Â  (citing Jeanes, 255 S.C. at 167, 177 S.E.2d at 540).Â  While an admission of nonmarriage by one party, fortified by strong circumstances, may suffice to overcome the presumption of marriage from cohabitation and reputation, such an admission is insufficient to overcome the presumption where it is shown the admission may well have been made with reference to a ceremonial marriage, and not uttered with the idea of negating the marital status.Â  Owens, 320 S.C. at 545, 466 S.E.2d at 375.\r\nIt is well settled, however, when there exists an impediment to marriage, such as one partyâ€™s marriage to a third person, no common-law marriage may be formed, regardless of whether there is any mutual assent.Â  Callen, 365 S.C. at 624, 620 S.E.2d at 62. Our courts have held that a relationship illicit at its inception does not ripen into a common-law marriage once the impediment to marriage is removed.Â  Instead, the law presumes that the relationship retains its illicit character after removal of the impediment.Â  Johns v. Johns, 309 S.C. 199, 201-02, 420 S.E.2d 856, 858 (Ct. App. 1992); Prevatte v. Prevatte, 297 S.C. 345, 349, 377 S.E.2d 114, 117 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  After the impediment is removed, the relationship is not automatically transformed into a common-law marriage, but is presumed to remain non-marital.Â  Callen, 365 S.C. at 624, 620 S.E.2d at 62.Â  In order for the relationship to become marital, â€œâ€˜there must be a new mutual agreement either by way of civil ceremony or by way of recognition of the illicit relation and a new agreement to enter into a common law marriage.â€™â€Â  Id.Â  (quoting Kirby, 270 S.C. at 141, 241 S.E.2d at 416).Â  This new mutual agreement must be shown to exist by the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Kirby, 270 S.C. at 141, 241 S.E.2d at 416.Â  However, such agreement may be gathered from the conduct of the parties.Â  Johns, 309 S.C. at 202, 420 S.E.2d at 858; Prevatte, 297 S.C. at 349, 377 S.E.2d at 117.\r\nTurning to the partiesâ€™ conduct after removal of the impediment to marriage, the record shows that Ray admitted the partiesâ€™ relationship continued after Gladysâ€™ divorce in 1995 as it had been prior to the divorce, where they shared expenses, engaged in sex, obtained car insurance together, Ray referred to Gladys as his â€œold lady,â€ and his license plate read â€œAS ONEâ€.Â  There is also evidence of record that the parties lived together throughout their relationship, that Gladys believed their relationship was the same as marriage and held herself out as being married to Ray after the divorce, â€œeveryone thought [they] were married,â€ that Ray used the phrase â€œAS ONEâ€ on his license plate to refer to them â€œas one personâ€ and continued to refer to them this way to other people after 1995, and that Gladys wore her wedding rings and Ray also wore his on occasion, continuing to do so after 1995. There is further independent evidence of the partiesâ€™ â€œapparently matrimonialâ€ relationship subsequent to the divorce.Â  Two envelopes post-marked December 2003 were addressed to â€œRay and Mousey Tidwellâ€ and â€œGladys and Ray Tidwell.â€Â  Finally, Gladysâ€™ daughter testified Rayâ€™s references to Gladys as his wife or his â€œold ladyâ€ continued up until the time the parties separated, and Tina Floyd testified Ray never corrected her when she referred to Gladys as Rayâ€™s wife.Â  Accordingly, there is some evidence, based on the conduct of the parties, of a new agreement between them to enter into a common-law marriage after the impediment was removed by Gladysâ€™ divorce from Donald in March 1995.Â  Additionally, there is evidence Gladysâ€™ actions in listing herself as unmarried or single and referring to Ray as her boyfriend were based on her belief that a ceremonial marriage was necessary to refer to a marital relationship in legal documentation and these statements were thus made with reference to a ceremonial marriage, not uttered with the idea of negating the partiesâ€™ marital status.\r\nAs previously noted, this courtâ€™s review is limited to a determination of whether any evidence supports the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  The question is not what conclusion this court might reach on the issue had it been the fact-finder, but whether the facts as found by the family court are supported by the evidence.Â  Given our limited standard of review, we are constrained to uphold the family courtâ€™s decision in this matter.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the family court is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]â€œMouseyâ€ is Gladysâ€™ nickname.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-165","title":"State v.

Â Husband appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in failing to terminate his alimony obligation to Wife.Â  Husband contends his alimony obligation requires him to liquidate his retirement savings, which constitutes an impermissible continuing division of assets.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn appeals from family courts, we have jurisdiction to find the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Bannen v. Bannen, 286 S.C. 24, 26, 331 S.E.2d 379, 380 (Ct. App. 1985) (citations omitted). Â Questions regarding alimony rest with the sound discretion of the trial judge, whose conclusion will not be disturbed absent a showing of abuse of discretion. Â Id.\r\nWe note that the family court reduced Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation by $700 per month based on changed circumstances, and Wife has not challenged this ruling.Â  Therefore, we are left to consider whether the family court abused its discretion in failing to terminate alimony.Â  We conclude that the evidence does not justify a complete termination of all alimony support.Â Â Â  \r\nAt the time of the hearing, Wife was 70 years old and suffering from various medical conditions, including diabetes and macular degeneration.Â  After the divorce, Wife worked and accumulated retirement assets totaling $265,067.Â  Although Wife was not withdrawing funds from her IRA at the time of the hearing, she testified that she would be required to begin withdrawing funds when she reached the age of 70 Â½ in a few months.Â  Wife lived in a condominium she purchased for $89,900.Â  Her monthly income, including alimony, was $2,702, and she estimated her monthly expenses at $2,704.Â  \r\nHusband voluntarily retired from employment in 1985, at the age of 54. Â Â Â He remarried shortly after his divorce from Wife, and in 1990, he set up a trust which owns all of the assets of his current marriage, including the $250,000 marital home, which is completely controlled by his current wife.Â  At the hearing, Husband testified his only income is a pension and social security totaling $1481 per month, and his only asset is an IRA totaling $277,526.52.Â  He asserted that he had to deplete the principal of his retirement assets in order to support himself and pay alimony, and that theÂ  principal balance of his IRA account was reduced from $523,087 in 1997 to $277,526.52 in 2005.Â  Husband also testified that he cares for his adult daughter, who suffers from severe mental problems and is unable to work, and receives $522 per month in social security benefits.Â  \r\nThe family court noted that both parties had reached a point in their lives when their ability to earn income had nearly vanished and their expenses had increased due to medical bills, and, after the reduction in alimony, the parties had nearly equal income.Â  The evidence demonstrates that Wife is in need of financial support from Husband in order to meet her expenses.Â  Because the purpose of alimony is to place the supported spouse, as nearly as is practical, in the position of support she enjoyed during the marriage, we find the family court did not err in declining to terminate alimony.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  \r\nMoreover, we find Husbandâ€™s argument that the liquidation of his retirement assets constitutes an impermissible continuing division of assets to be without merit.Â  Husband has an income of $2,300 per month, including social security for his daughter.Â  Although Husband may be required to liquidate his retirement savings in order to support himself and maintain his lifestyle, the purpose of the IRA is to support Husband in his retirement and the family courtâ€™s order does not require him to turn over assets to Wife.Â  The family courtâ€™s order deals solely with Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation and does not constitute a division of marital assets.\r\nHusband next argues the family court erred in requiring him to take a monthly $200 credit toward his alimony obligation until the $19,627.20 overpayments are paid in full.Â  We disagree.\r\nHusband relies on our decision in Walker v. Frericks, 292 S.C. 87, 354 S.E.2d 915 (Ct. App. 1987), to support his position that the family court erred in ordering the $200 monthly offset.Â  In Walker, Walker (wife) brought an action against Frericks (husband) to collect an alimony arrearage in the amount of $10,660, and the family court ordered Frericks to pay the arrearage in $40 monthly installments.Â  Id. at 92, 354 S.E.2d at 919.Â  Based on Frericksâ€™ income and assets, we held that the family court abused its discretion, and we increased the payment on the arrearage to $125 per month.Â  Id. at 93, 354 S.E.2d at 919.Â  \r\nWalker is clearly distinguishable from the case at bar.Â  In Walker, Frericks, the payor spouse, had substantial means to repay Walker at a higher rate, and the debt resulted from an arrearage.Â  Here, Wife is reimbursing Husband for an overpayment of alimony resulting from the courtâ€™s order decreasing Husbandâ€™s monthly alimony obligation.Â  The $200 offset is equitable considering Wifeâ€™s financial situation.Â  The family court decreased Wifeâ€™s alimony from $1,700 to $1000 per month, and Wife will only receive $800 per month until Husband recoups the cost of the overpayment, resulting in a 50% decrease in Wifeâ€™s alimony income.Â  Moreover, there is nothing in the record to indicate Wife was at fault for the two-year delay between the date Husband filed the action and the date the written order was issued.Â  Accordingly, the order of the family court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215,\r\nSCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-167","title":"State v.

Carter, Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott,\r\nAssistant Attorney General Deborah R. J. Shupe, Office of the Attorney General, of Columbia; Warren Blair Giese, Fifth Circuit Solicitorâ€™s Office, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Myron Williams appeals his convictions for criminal sexual conduct with a minor who is at least eleven years of age but less than fourteen years of age, and criminal sexual conduct with a minor who is at least fourteen years of age but less than sixteen years of age, for which he received consecutive sentences of twenty years in prison, suspended on the service of five years probation, and twenty years in prison, respectively.Â  Williams argues the trial court erred in admitting a pornographic video into evidence and erred in failing to grant his motion for a mistrial.Â Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn September 6, 2002, Bridgett Williams (Daughter), a student at Eau Claire High School, was caught partially undressed with a male student in a locker room.Â  Anna Downs, the school guidance counselor, interviewed Daughter about the incident.Â  Daughter told Downs that the last person she had sex with was â€œher daddy,â€ Myron Williams.Â  Downs then called DSS, the school resource officer, and made all the necessary reports. \r\nIn the following days, an investigation corroborated Daughterâ€™s account of abuse by her father.Â  The Richland County Grand Jury indicted Williams on two counts of second-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor. \r\nAt trial, Daughter, then sixteen years old, testified that Williams started touching her â€œprivateâ€ when she was eight to ten years old.Â  The sexual contact included oral sex, digital penetration, and sexual intercourse.Â Â Â  Daughter testified the incidents occurred more than once a month and continued until she was fifteen.Â  Daughter also testified, without objection, that during the times of the incidents, they would watch pornographic movies. \r\nBeverly Conyers, an investigator with the Columbia Police Department, testified she interviewed Daughter on September 6, 2002.Â Â  Daughter informed Conyers that Williams began assaulting her when she was around ten or eleven, the assaults occurred about four times a month, and the assaults were ongoing.Â  Daughter indicated that the last time she had sex with Williams was September 4, 2002.Â Â Â  \r\nConyers interviewed Williams on September 11, 2002.Â  Williams admitted to having sex with Daughter one time about a year before.Â  \r\nConyers questioned Williams about a video Daughter stated he had shown her during some of the incidents.Â  Williams informed Conyers that he had an â€œRâ€ rated DVD from Blockbuster entitled â€œCrimes of Passionâ€ in his truck, and he described the cover of the video.Â  The State sought to introduce a synopsis of the video found on Blockbusterâ€™s website and an â€œXâ€ rated copy of the movie matching Williamsâ€™s description.Â  Williams objected to the admission of the video and the synopsis arguing they were irrelevant and prejudicial.Â  The court held both pieces of evidence could be admitted â€œbased on earlier testimony.â€Â  \r\nOn cross examination, Conyers was extensively questioned about her investigation and testified that she â€œspoke with [Williamsâ€™s] sister who said heâ€™s a pervert.â€Â  After this testimony, defense counsel asked to approach the bench, and a brief bench conference was held.Â  Defense counsel then made an objection to the statement on the record and made a motion to strike the testimony as nonresponsive.Â  The court sustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard the statement.Â  The State then asked to discuss the matter outside the presence of the jury.Â  After a brief discussion, the trial court informed defense counsel:\r\n\r\nI think you wanted to make a motion for a mistrial. I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s what you still want to do.Â  I will instruct the jury that they should disregard the last statement . . . . Iâ€™ll tell them to disregard the last statement again and let you continue, counsel.Â  Iâ€™m not going to grant a mistrial on that.\r\n\r\nDefense counsel responded, â€œThank you.â€Â Â  After a brief recess, the jury was brought back to the courtroom, and the trial resumed.Â Â  \r\nWilliams was found guilty of criminal sexual conduct with a minor who is at least eleven years of age but less than fourteen years of age and criminal sexual conduct with a minor who is at least fourteen years of age but less than sixteen years of age, for which he received consecutive sentences of twenty years, suspended on the service of five years probation, and twenty years incarceration, respectively.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAdmission of Pornographic Video \r\nWilliams argues the trial court erred in allowing a pornographic videotape into evidence because it was irrelevant, prejudicial, and inadmissible prior bad act evidence.Â  We disagree. \r\nâ€œ[T]he admission of evidence is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge and absent clear abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law, the lower courtâ€™s ruling will not be disturbed on appeal.â€Â  Hofer v. St. Clair, 298 S.C. 503, 513, 381 S.E.2d 736, 742 (1989).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is based on an error of law or a factual conclusion without evidentiary support.â€Â  Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 363 S.C. 460, 467, 611 S.E.2d 905, 908 (2005).Â  â€œTo warrant reversal based on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the appellant must prove both the error of the ruling and the resulting prejudice, i.e., there is a reasonable probability the juryâ€™s verdict was influenced by the wrongly admitted or excluded evidence.â€Â  Id.\r\nâ€œAll relevant evidence is admissible.â€Â  State v. Pagan, 357 S.C. 132, 142, 591 S.E.2d 646, 651 (Ct. App. 2004) (cert. granted Oct. 10, 2005).Â  â€œRelevant evidenceâ€ is defined as â€œevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.â€Â  Rule 401, SCRE.Â  â€œUnder Rule 401, SCRE, evidence is relevant if it has a direct bearing upon and tends to establish or make more or less probable the matter in controversy.â€Â  State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 378, 580 S.E.2d 785, 794 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nWe find the video is relevant.Â  Daughter testified that Williams would play â€œpornosâ€ while the sexual assaults occurred.Â  Thus, evidence Williams possessed a movie of a sexual nature during this period tends to make the alleged sexual assaults more probable.Â  \r\nâ€œAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.â€Â  Rule 403, SCRE; see also, State v. Alexander, 303 S.C. 377, 382, 401 S.E.2d 146, 149 (1991) (holding relevant evidence may be excluded where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice). \r\nThe record indicates the pornographic video in question was allegedly viewed during the sexual assaults.Â  Thus, the video is highly probative of the alleged crimes and was properly admitted.Â  Because of the connection between the act and the viewing of the video, we do not find the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the video.Â Â  \r\nWilliams contends the evidence of the video was evidence of a prior bad act and improperly admitted to show Williamsâ€™s propensity to commit the alleged crime.Â  We find this issue is not preserved for review because, at trial, Williams never argued the video constituted prior bad act evidence.Â \r\nSee State v. Conyers, 326 S.C. 263, 266, 487 S.E.2d 181, 183 (1997) (explaining that an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review).Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDenial of Motion for Mistrial \r\nWilliams alleges the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial pursuant to prejudicial testimony characterizing Williams as a pervert.Â  We find this issue is not preserved for review.\r\nA party must make a contemporaneous objection to the sufficiency of a curative instruction to preserve alleged error for review.Â  State v. Jones, 325 S.C. 310, 316, 479 S.E.2d 517, 520 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œAn instruction to disregard incompetent evidence or the withdrawal of such evidence usually is deemed to have cured the error in its admission unless on the facts of the particular case it is probable that notwithstanding such instruction or withdrawal the accused was prejudiced.â€Â  State v. Craig, 267 S.C. 262, 268, 227 S.E.2d 306, 309 (1976).Â  Here, Williams failed to object, on the record, to the trial courtâ€™s curative instruction, and thus, this issue is not preserved. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the above, we find the trial court did not err in admitting the pornographic video.Â  We further find Williams failed to preserve any issue he had with regard to his motion for a mistrial. The decision of the trial court is accordingly \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-168","title":"State v.

Yates, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nFrank B. McMaster, John Gregg McMaster, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this legal malpractice action, Larry A. Yates appeals the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of Francis T. Draine based on the statute of limitations of section 15-3-535 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005).Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1988, Yates and his corporation entered federal bankruptcy.Â  Thereafter, Yates was indicted and arrested for bankruptcy fraud.Â  In 1996, Yates filed a pro se suit in federal court against the federal officials involved in the bankruptcy and criminal prosecution and against Robert Rutland, a former business associate.Â  Yates hired Draine to represent him, and Draine filed an amended complaint on Yatesâ€™s behalf.Â  The amended complaint alleged civil conspiracy, negligence, negligent misrepresentation, negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress, violation of constitutional rights, conversion, defamation, tortious interference with contractual relations, and malicious prosecution.Â  The complaint was dismissed as to all parties.Â  This was the only instance Draine represented Yates in any proceeding.\r\nIn 1997, Rutland brought an action against Yates and Draine over the recently dismissed federal action.Â  Draine received a grant of summary judgment dismissing the entire complaint against him.Â  The causes of action against Yates remained.\r\nAfter Draine was dismissed, Yates asked Draineâ€™s attorney, Henry Dargan McMaster, to represent him in the November 18, 1999 summary judgment motion in the Rutland action.Â  McMaster ultimately agreed to the limited representation of Yates in the summary judgment hearing.Â  After two continuances, neither of which were requested by McMaster, McMaster learned the case was set for trial on February 28, 2000, so he withdrew from representing Yates as he only agreed to represent Yates at the summary judgment hearing.Â  A formal motion withdrawing as counsel was filed on March 6, 2000.Â  After Yates obtained new counsel, the case went to trial, and a verdict against Yates was returned.\r\nYates filed this action against Draine in August 2001, alleging negligence/legal malpractice, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract arising from Draineâ€™s representation in the federal civil suit filed by Yates in 1996.Â  Draine moved for summary judgment based on the statute of limitations, and the circuit court granted the motion.Â  Yates appealed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard which governs the trial court: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Baughman v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 114-15, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545 (1991).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, 61, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998).Â  On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.Â  Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nYates argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Draine based on the statute of limitations.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 15-3-530 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2003) provides a three-year statute of limitations for legal malpractice lawsuits.Â  Under the discovery rule, the statute of limitations begins to run from the date the injured party either knows or should know, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, that a cause of action exists for the wrongful conduct. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-535 (Supp. 2001); Dean v. Ruscon Corp., 321 S.C. 360, 468 S.E.2d 645 (1996).Â  The supreme court has held:\r\n\r\nThe exercise of reasonable diligence means simply that an injured party must act with some promptness where the facts and circumstances of an injury would put a person of common knowledge and experience on notice that some right of his has been invaded or that some claim against another party might exist. The statute of limitations begins to run from this point and not when advice of counsel is sought or a full-blown theory of recovery developed. \r\n\r\nMitchell v. Holler, 311 S.C. 406, 412, 429 S.E.2d 793, 799 (1993).Â  Moreover, the standard is objective and not subjective.Â  Berry v. McLeod, 328 S.C. 435, 438, 492 S.E.2d 794, 796 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œThe statute of limitations begins to run at the time the individual has inquiry or constructive notice.â€Â  Id. at 413, 492 S.E.2d at 800.\r\nYatesâ€™s own testimony clearly establishes that he became completely and fully aware of any alleged malpractice in January 1997.Â  Yates stated in his affidavit:\r\n\r\nI was shocked and could hardly believe what all I had uncovered about Attorney Draine from the record of my case at the Clerk of Courtâ€™s office on January 6, 1997.Â  \r\n\r\nIn his deposition, Yates conceded:\r\n\r\nIâ€™ll establish the fact that in January â€™97 I was certainly aware of the problems we were having.Â  So if you want to establish that for the fact of the statute of limitations, you got it established.Â  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Yates sent a letter to Draine in January 1997 complaining of Draineâ€™s performance.Â  Yates was on notice, by his own admission, of a perceived problem with Draineâ€™s representation on January 6, 1997, and should have filed his action within three years of that date.Â  Yates did not file this action until August 1, 2001, almost twenty months after the statute of limitations had run. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of Draine is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., ANDERSON and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-171","title":"State v.

Brooks, of Spartanburg, for Appellant.\r\nMichael Todd Thigpen, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Michael Walters filedan action requesting a recalculation of child support payments to Laura Pitts.Â  The family courtÂ  increased Waltersâ€™ child support obligation retroactive to January 1, 2002, required Walters to pay via wage withholding through the Spartanburg County Clerk of Courtâ€™s Office, and ordered Walters to pay Pittsâ€™ attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  Walters appeals the family courtâ€™s ruling.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMichael C. Walters and Laura A. Pitts were divorced under a Joint Bill for Divorce filed in Mississippi on January 18, 2001.Â  Walters and Pitts are the parents of one minor child, William Tyler Walters, who was born December 16, 1996.Â  \r\nUnder a Child Support Consent Order (Consent Order) issued by the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of Chesterfield County, Virginia on February 7, 2001, Walters and Pitts agreed Walters would pay Pitts $550 per month as child support.Â  Walters and Pitts further agreed the support payments would begin January 1, 2001, and would be â€œby way of payroll deduction.â€ Â In addition, the Consent Order provides: \r\n\r\nThe parties stipulate that they are aware of the presumptive amount of child support called for in this case by the Virginia Child Support Guidelines as set forth in Â§ 20-108.2 of the Code of Virginia.Â  The parties further stipulate that the amount of support agreed upon herein is a voluntary downward deviation from said guidelines which shall remain in effect until January 1, 2002.Â  This deviation is agreed upon in order to aid Michael C. Walters in establishing himself in a new residence in Texas.Â  Both parties are aware that either of them may petition the Court for a modification of this order upon a showing of a material change in circumstances.Â  The parties stipulate that a material change of circumstances shall be deemed to have occurred when their agreement to a downward deviation expires January 1, 2002.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nOn May 13, 2002, Pitts filed an action in Spartanburg County seeking to modify the amount of child support set in the Consent Order.Â  Although Pitts alleges she did not give her authorization, this action was dismissed under an Order of Dismissal filed January 9, 2003, for lack of personal jurisdiction over Walters.Â  \r\nIn June 2003, Walters brought an action in Texas concerning enforcement of visitation.Â  On June 13, 2003, Walters and Pitts entered into an Agreed Order of Enforcement regarding visitation;Â  Pitts was also ordered to pay $4,100 to Walters for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  \r\nIn May 2003, Pitts filed another action in Spartanburg County, seeking a modification of Waltersâ€™ visitation and an increase in child support.Â  Walters moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over him.Â  By order dated October 10, 2003, the court concluded it had jurisdiction to hear and determine visitation, but lacked jurisdiction to modify Waltersâ€™ child support obligation.Â  On November 14, 2003, the court issued an order modifying Waltersâ€™ visitation; the order did not address child support.Â  \r\nOn December 29, 2003, Pitts filed an action in Texas, where Walters was residing at the time, seeking modification of the Consent Order.Â  Walters then filed this action in Spartanburg, and filed a Motion to Dismiss the Texas action alleging South Carolina was a more appropriate forum.Â  Subsequently, Pittsâ€™ Texas action was dismissed pursuant to a Notice of\r\nNonsuit.&nbsp; \r\nWaltersâ€™ complaint in this action was filed on January 30, 2004, and requested a recalculation of child support payments.Â  Walters failed to appear at the scheduled hearing, and the court concluded it would be fair and equitable to both parties for the hearing to be one for temporary relief.Â  Under a Temporary Order filed October 8, 2004, the court: (1) increased Waltersâ€™ child support obligation retroactive to January 1, 2002; (2) concluded Walters owed a total of $7,765 as retroactive child support; (3) increased Waltersâ€™ net monthly child support obligation to $811; (4) directed Walters to provide Pitts with up-to-date financial information and a current address; and (5) ordered Walters to pay Pitts $1,000 for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs. \r\nA final hearing was held on January 19, 2005.Â  Under a Final Order, dated March 11, 2005, the court: (1) recalculated Waltersâ€™ child support obligation pursuant to the South Carolina Child Support Guidelines;[1] (2) held Walters owes Pitts a total child support arrearage of $9,569;[2] (3) required Walters to pay via wage withholding through the Spartanburg County Clerk of Courtâ€™s Office; (4) required Walters to repay retroactive child support award and arrearage at the rate of $200 per month; (5) required Walters and Pitts to maintain health insurance coverage on their minor child and divide excess, uncovered medical expenses for their minor child; and (6) ordered Walters to pay $2,150, by way of contribution, for Pittsâ€™ attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  \r\nWalters appeals the family courtâ€™s order.Â  Specifically, Walters appeals the award of retroactive child support increases prior to August 15, 2004, and the manner of payment through the court.Â  In addition, Walters requests a credit for excess payments and attorneyâ€™s fees he paid to Pitts. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn an action on appeal from the family court, the appellate court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â \r\nEngle v. Engle, 343 S.C. 444, 448, 539 S.E.2d 712, 714 (Ct. App. 2000) (citation omitted).Â  â€œThe appellate court is not, however, required to ignore the fact that the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.â€Â  Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 297, 513 S.E.2d 358, 367 (1999) (citation omitted).Â  â€œChild support awards are addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge and, absent an abuse of discretion, will not be disturbed on appeal.â€Â \r\nEngle, 343 S.C. at 448, 539 S.E.2d at 714 (citation omitted).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the court is controlled by some error of law or where the order, based upon findings of fact, is without evidentiary support.â€ Â Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, 485, 477 S.E.2d 727, 729 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Retroactive Child Support\r\nWalters argues the family court erred in increasing Waltersâ€™ child support obligations retroactive to January 1, 2002.Â  We agree the family court erred in retroactively increasing child support to January 1, 2002, but find the facts warrant a retroactive increase to December 29, 2003.Â  \r\nâ€œA prior action concerning child support is res judicata only as long as the circumstances existing at the time of the prior action have remained the same.â€Â  Marsh v. Hancock, 288 S.C. 341, 345, 342 S.E.2d 607, 609 (1986) (citation omitted). Â â€œAn order of child support is subject to modification upon the showing of a sufficient change of conditions.â€ Â Hughes v. Hughes, 280 S.C. 388, 390, 313 S.E. 2d 32, 33 (Ct. App. 1984) (citation omitted). Â â€œ[C]hild support is always modifiable upon a proper showing of a change in either the childâ€™s needs or the supporting parentâ€™s financial ability.â€Â  Calvert v. Calvert, 287 S.C. 130, 137, 336 S.E.2d 884, 888 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  \r\nâ€œThe decision to award retroactive child support rests in the sound discretion of the family court.â€Â \r\nEngle v. Engle, 343 S.C. 444, 453, 539 S.E.2d 712, 716 (Ct. App. 2000) (citation omitted).Â  Section 20-7-933 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) provides: \r\n\r\nThe family court has the authority to enforce the provisions of any decree, judgment, or order regarding child support of a court of this State, including cases with jurisdiction based on the revised Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, provided that personal jurisdiction has been properly established. This authority includes the right to modify any such decree, judgment, or order for child support as the court considers necessary upon a showing of changed circumstances. No such modification is effective as to any installment accruing prior to filing and service of the action for modification. Additionally, the family court has the right to hold any arrearage in child support in abeyance.\r\n\r\nSection 20-7-933 â€œdoes not bar retroactive child support increases in special circumstances where, to do so, would result in serious injustice.â€Â  Harris v. Harris, 307 S.C. 351, 353, 415 S.E.2d 391, 392-393 (1992).Â  The power to award retroactive child support â€œdepends upon the facts and circumstances of each case.â€Â  Wint v. Wint, 310 S.C. 48, 50, 425 S.E.2d 48, 50 (Ct. App. 1992) (citation omitted).\r\nInitially, we find a sufficient change of circumstances existed to warrant a modification of the child support obligation.Â  This action was commenced in January 2004, and the Consent Order specifically provides that a â€œmaterial change of circumstances shall be deemed to have occurred when their agreement to a downward deviation expires January 1, 2002.â€Â  Moreover, the Consent Order was based on a â€œdownward deviation to aid [Walters] in establishing himself in a new residence in Texas,â€ and sufficient time has elapsed to satisfy this basis.Â  In addition, Walters has received a pay raise.Â  \r\nPursuant to section 20-7-933, the family court may modify a child support obligation without a showing of special circumstances to the date of filing.Â  Indeed, Walters admitted the court may retroactively modify the support obligation to the date of the filing of this action.Â  Thus, because the present action was filed on January 30, 2004, this court needs only to determine whether special circumstances existed to warrant a retroactive modification before that date.Â Â Â  \r\nThe family court held special circumstances existed to warrant a retroactive increase to January 1, 2002, mainly because â€œthe fact that [Walters] subsequently filed this action in an effort to deprive the Texas Court of jurisdiction . . . makes it appear [Waltersâ€™] primary motive for asking this Court to dismiss the 2002 and 2003 actions was to avoid having his child support obligation recalculated.â€Â  The family court also noted Walters failed to appear at the originally scheduled hearing and failed to provide his attorney with up-to-date income information.Â  \r\nWe find, under the facts of this case, special circumstances do not exist to warrant a retroactive child support increase to January 1, 2002, but special circumstances do exist to warrant a retroactive increase to December 29, 2003.Â  On December 29, 2003, Pitts, for the first time, filed an action seeking an increase in child support in an appropriate jurisdiction.Â  Prior to December 29, 2003, the ultimate cause of delay lies with Pitts; Pitts needed only to file in an appropriate jurisdiction in order to have the child support obligation modified.Â  Based on these facts, no serious injustice can be reasonably construed to warrant a retroactive increase to January 1, 2002, and the trial court committed an abuse of discretion in so finding.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nHowever, once Pitts filed in an appropriate jurisdiction, Walters became solely responsible for the ensuing delays in modification.Â  The fact that Walters subsequently filed this action in South Carolina, a state where Walters previously contested jurisdiction on two separate occasions, can only be interpreted as an attempt to manipulate the system and delay modification.Â  To allow Walters to benefit from such delay tactics would result in a â€œserious injustice.â€ Harris, 307 S.C. at 353, 415 S.E.2d at 393.[3]Â  \r\nWalters, citing Harris, argues a party must show a â€œfraud upon the courtâ€ to warrant a retroactive child support modification. Â However, Walters misconstrues Harris.Â  In Harris, the court found that the â€œ[f]atherâ€™s failure to disclose his increased earnings from 1987 to 1990 constitutes a special circumstance warranting a retroactive increase.â€ Â Id. at 353, 415 S.E.2d at 393.Â  In Harris, the father failed to make any reference to his brokerage business in his financial declaration, and thus, the support obligation was based upon inaccurate income information.Â  Id. at 352, 415 S.E.2d at 392.Â  Similarly, in this case, Waltersâ€™ delay tactics caused the support obligation paid, since December 29, 2003, to be based upon income information that was inaccurate. Â Â \r\nPursuant to the above, we remand to the family court to recalculate Waltersâ€™ total arrears, if any.Â  In the alternative, the family court must give Walters credit for any excess payments.Â  The family court must determine the most appropriate method for either paying the arrears or giving Walters a credit.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nPayment to Clerk of Court \r\nWalters contends the family court abused its discretion in requiring child support payments to be made through the clerk of court.Â  We disagree. \r\nIn â€œcases in which support orders are issued or modified . . . the income of an obligor is subject to immediate withholding as of the effective date of the order without requirement that an arrearage accumulate.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1315(B)(1) (Supp. 2005).Â  However, section 20-7-1315 further provides â€œincome is not subject to withholding if: (a) one of the parties demonstrates and the court finds that there is good cause not to require immediate income withholding; or (b) a written agreement is reached between both parties which provides for an alternative arrangement.â€\r\nThe record indicates, pursuant to the Consent Order, Walters has always paid support payments â€œby way of payroll deductionâ€ through the Virginia Department of Social Services.[4]Â  In addition, Walters lives out of state and, as the trial court noted, â€œwage withholding is the most reliable way to ensure that [Walters] pays his child support payments.â€Â  Therefore, we find the family court did not commit an abuse of discretion in requiring Walters to pay child support payments via wage withholding.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAttorney Fees and CostsÂ  \r\nWalters asserts the family courtâ€™s awarding of attorneyâ€™s fees to Pitts should be remanded and reconsidered if Waltersâ€™ appeal is successful.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs is a discretionary matter not to be overturned absent abuse by the trial court.Â  Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 365, 384 S.E.2d 741, 748 (1989).Â  â€œIn determining whether an attorneyâ€™s fee should be awarded, the following factors\r\nshould be considered: (1) the partyâ€™s ability to pay his/her own attorneyâ€™s fee; (2) beneficial results obtained by the attorney; (3) the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions; (4) effect of the attorneyâ€™s fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.â€Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  The factors the family court should consider in awarding reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees and costs include: â€œ(1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) professional standing of counsel; (4) contingency of compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained; and (6) customary legal fees for similar services.â€ Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).Â Â Â  Â \r\n\r\n The record supports the family courtâ€™s specific findings of fact on the relevant issues.Â  In addition, Walters contributed to the increased fees by causing the Texas action to be dismissed, and failing to appear at the originally scheduled hearing.Â  Although we ruled in Waltersâ€™ favor by reversing the retroactive increase of child support payments from January 1, 2002 to December 29, 2003, this alone is not dispositive of our decision regarding the award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Pitts.Â  See \r\nBrowning v. Browning, 366 S.C. 255, 269, 621 S.E.2d 389, 396 (Ct. App. 2005) (declining to vacate Wifeâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees even though appellate court ruled in favor of Husband on several issues when court ruled for Wife on other issues, Husband failed to comply with terms of Property Settlement Agreement, and family court properly considered other requisite factors).Â  Thus, we find the family court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to Pitts.Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the family court committed an abuse of discretion in retroactively increasing Waltersâ€™ child support obligation to January 1, 2002.Â  We hold Waltersâ€™ child support obligation should be increased retroactive to December 29, 2003.Â  We further find the family court did not abuse its discretion in requiring Walters to pay child support through the clerk of court.Â  We also find Pitts is entitled to an award for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  We remand to the family court to recalculate Waltersâ€™ child support obligation based on the foregoing.Â  The decision of the family court is accordingly\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nBEATTY, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The court increased Waltersâ€™ net monthly child support obligation to $967 through March 15, 2005; thereafter, Waltersâ€™ net monthly child support obligation was set at $904 because the parties agreed the support obligation should be reduced when Waltersâ€™ new child is born in late March.Â  \r\n[2] This figure was arrived at by combining $8,723 as retroactive child support ($7,765 that Walters was directed to pay as retroactive child support under the October 8, 2004 Temporary Order, and $958 as additional arrearage accumulated after the Temporary Hearing) with the increased support payments based on Waltersâ€™ up-to-date financial information retroactive to August 15, 2004.Â  \r\n[3] We note Pittsâ€™ voluntary dismissal of the Texas action should not be held against her because she was attempting to expedite modification.Â  \r\n[4] In Virginia, orders for wage withholding require the employer of the obligor to send the withheld amount to the Virginia Department of Social Services who then disburses the funds to the obligee.Â  See Va. Code Ann. Â§ 20-79.1(2005).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-175","title":"Bass v.

E. Bonnoitt, Jr., Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-175\r\nSubmitted March 1, 2006 â€“ Filed March 28, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nDaphne A. Burns, of Mount Pleasant, for Appellant.Â  \r\nCharles Bass, of Georgetown, for Respondent.\r\nJoe Michael Crosby, of Georgetown, for Guardian Ad Litem.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Cheryl Bass (Wife) appeals the family courtâ€™s order in her divorce action against Charles Bass (Husband).Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife married in March of 1985.Â  The parties have a minor daughter and an emancipated son.Â  The family lived at the marital residence in Georgetown until October of 2002, when Wife left with the daughter and moved to another of the partiesâ€™ Georgetown residences.Â  \r\nThe family court granted the parties a divorce on the ground of Husbandâ€™s adultery and awarded Wife custody of and support for the partiesâ€™ daughter; awarded sixty percent of the marital estate to Husband and forty percent to Wife; ordered the parties to split the marital credit card debt 50/50; awarded Wife $850 per month in alimony; awarded Wife $7,500 in attorneyâ€™s fees; and required Husband to maintain medical insurance for the daughter.Â  \r\nWife filed a motion to reconsider.Â  Prior to the courtâ€™s decision on the motion, Wife moved to amend on the ground of after-discovered evidence of Husbandâ€™s adultery, asserting she found explicit photographs of Husbandâ€™s paramour.Â  Wife requested the court consider the evidence in conjunction with her motion to reconsider the equitable distribution award.Â  The family court denied Wifeâ€™s motion to amend and her motion to reconsider.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  Nor must we ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981).Â  The apportionment of marital property is within the discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 542, 615 S.E.2d 98, 103 (2005).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Motion to Amend the Motion to Reconsider\r\nWife contends the family court erred in denying her motion to amend her motion to reconsider and in not reconsidering Husbandâ€™s misconduct in light of the after-discovered evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo obtain a new trial based on after-discovered evidence, a movant must establish that the evidence:Â  (1) will probably change the result if a new trial is granted; (2) has been discovered since the trial; (3) could not have been discovered before the trial; (4) is material to the issue; and (5) is not merely cumulative or impeaching.Â  Lanier v. Lanier, 364 S.C. 211, 217, 612 S.E.2d 456, 458 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  See also Rule 60(b)(2), SCRCP.Â  The decision to grant a new trial based on after-discovered evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Bowman v. Bowman, 357 S.C. 146, 151, 591 S.E.2d 654, 656 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nWife argues the newly discovered pictures of Husbandâ€™s paramour entitle her to reconsideration and further argues the family court did not give weight to Husbandâ€™s misconduct in apportioning the marital estate.Â  The family court found the new pictures would â€œprobably not cause the Court to alter its prior decisionâ€ and it appeared to be offered â€œmerely for the purpose of impeaching a prior witness and is cumulative.â€Â  \r\nWe find no abuse of discretion by the family court, as the evidence was cumulative to other evidence of Husbandâ€™s adultery and the court clearly considered the adultery in its final order.Â  As evidenced by granting a divorce based on Husbandâ€™s adultery and in awarding alimony after assigning Husband â€œthe fault of the dissolution of this marriage,â€ the family court took Husbandâ€™s marital misconduct into account in its final order.Â  Because the family court considered Husbandâ€™s misconduct, we find no abuse of discretion.\r\nII.Â  Savings Bonds\r\nWife next contends the family court erred in not including the partiesâ€™ savings bonds in the marital estate.Â  We disagree.\r\nApproximately two months prior to the partiesâ€™ separation, Husband cashed over $12,000 in savings bonds without Wifeâ€™s knowledge.Â  The bonds were intended to fund the childrenâ€™s college education.Â  Husband testified he believed the money was not necessary for the children because the partiesâ€™ son dropped out of high school and was not attending college and the South Carolina lottery system would pay for their daughterâ€™s education.Â  Husband allegedly gave the money to his son from a previous marriage.Â  \r\nSubject to certain exceptions, the marital estate includes â€œall real and personal property which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2005).Â  To apportion property that is no longer in the marital estate, there must be evidence of willful misconduct, bad faith, or intention to dissipate marital assets.Â  Dixon&nbsp;v. Dixon, 334 S.C. 222, 232-33, 512 S.E.2d 539, 544 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Gifts to others during the marriage, absent proof of fraud, are not marital property for purposes of equitable distribution.Â  Panhorst v. Panhorst, 301 S.C. 100, 105-06, 390 S.E.2d 376, 379 (Ct. App. 1990).\r\nHusband cashed the bonds and gifted the proceeds to his son prior to the time Wife left the marital home.Â  We find the savings bonds do not meet the definition of â€œmarital property,â€ and there is insufficient evidence in the record to conclude that Husband cashed the bonds to intentionally dissipate marital funds in contemplation of marital litigation.Â  We discern no error.\r\nIII.Â  Marital Home\r\nWife contends the court erred in awarding the marital home to Husband.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe marital home is merely a share of the total marital estate.Â  Craig v. Craig, 365 S.C. 285, 291, 617 S.E.2d 359, 361 (2005).Â  The disposition of the residence in the context of equitable distribution of the marital estate is largely within the discretion of the family court.Â  Nasser-Moghaddassi v. Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. 182, 202, 612 S.E.2d 707, 718 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\nAs part of the equitable distribution, the family court awarded the marital home in Georgetown to Husband and two other Georgetown homes owned by the parties to Wife.Â  Wife requested the marital home based on the fact the daughter had been raised there and that she would be unable to attain comparable housing.Â  However, at the time of the final divorce decree, Wife and daughter had been living in one of the other Georgetown properties for approximately two years.Â  There is nothing in the record to indicate a problem for Wife or daughter under their current living conditions.Â  We find no abuse of discretion in the courtâ€™s award of the marital home to Husband.\r\nIV.Â  Life Insurance\r\nWife contends the court erred in failing to require Husband to maintain life insurance to secure the payment of child support.Â  We disagree.\r\nA party requesting life insurance as security for alimony or child support must show â€œspecial circumstancesâ€ for such an award.Â  Wooten, 364 S.C. at 553, 615 S.E.2d at 108.Â  Special circumstances include major health problems of the payor spouse or a payor spouseâ€™s inability or failure to pay his support obligation.Â  Id. at 550, 615 S.E.2d at 107.Â  In this case, no special circumstances exist to require Husband to maintain life insurance to secure his child support obligation.Â  Therefore, we find no error by the family court.\r\nV.Â  Other Issues Affecting Equitable Distribution \r\nWife contends the family court erred in considering her failed businesses and â€œexcessive credit card spendingâ€ in its distribution of the marital estate.Â  Wife further contends the family court erred in not assessing the amount of marital debt as of the beginning of the marital litigation, thereby failing to credit her for payments she made to reduce the credit card debt during the pendency of the action.Â  We find no reversible error. \r\nAs to the Wifeâ€™s businesses and spending, we recognize that â€œpoor business decisions, in and of themselves, do not warrant a finding of marital â€˜misconduct,â€™ and . . . there must be some evidence of willful misconduct, bad faith, intention to dissipate marital assets, or the like, before a court may alter the equitable distribution award for such misconduct.â€Â  McDavid v. McDavid, 333 S.C. 490, 496, 511 S.E.2d 365, 368 (1999).Â  The family court may, however, consider spending habits.Â  Deidun v. Deidun, 362 S.C. 47, 59, 606 S.E.2d 489, 496 (Ct. App. 2004) (distinguishing McDavid as more applicable to cases involving business expenditures as opposed to mere spending habits, which may be considered by the family court).Â  In the final divorce decree, the family court noted its consideration of Wifeâ€™s â€œexcessive credit card spendingâ€ and â€œfailed businessesâ€ in determining the equitable distribution of marital assets.Â  The court also found â€œthe accumulation of marital assets has been realized mainly by the [Husbandâ€™s] superior income during the marriage.â€Â  While consideration of Wifeâ€™s failed businesses may have been improper without a finding of Wifeâ€™s bad faith, we find no reversible error as we find the overall apportionment of the marital estate to be equitable.Â  \r\nBecause we find the overall apportionment of the marital estate to be equitable, we likewise find no error in the courtâ€™s apportionment of the marital debt.Â  Wife asserts that between the time of filing and the final divorce hearing, she paid $15,398.10 towards the credit card debt and reduced the total debt by approximately $9,400.Â  Wife contends she should be reimbursed for a percentage of these payments.Â  In equitably dividing the marital estate, the family court must â€œgive weight in such proportion as it finds appropriateâ€ to â€œexisting debts incurred by the parties or either of them during the course of the marriage.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (13) (Supp. 2005).Â  The words â€œin such proportion as it finds appropriate,â€ as used in the statute, accord much discretion to the trial judge in providing for the payment of marital debts as a consideration in the equitable division of the marital estate.Â  Hickum v. Hickum, 320 S.C. 97, 103, 463 S.E.2d 321, 324 (Ct. App. 1995). On review, this court looks to the fairness of the overall apportionment.Â  Id.Â  Because we find the overall apportionment to be fair, the fact that this court might have apportioned the estate differently than the family court is irrelevant.Â  See Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  We therefore affirm the family courtâ€™s equitable apportionment of the marital estate.Â  \r\nVII.Â  Private Investigator and Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nWife contends the family court erred in not awarding her separate suit costs for the private investigator fees and in not awarding her reasonable attorney fees.Â  We agree as to the private investigator fees and reverse that portion of the courtâ€™s order.Â  \r\nAs a result of finding repeated listings of another womanâ€™s phone number on her phone bills, Wife hired a private investigator to investigate Husbandâ€™s fidelity.Â  This investigation was undertaken approximately a month and a half after the parties separated and involved two private investigators.Â  Once the investigators were able to document evidence of Husbandâ€™s infidelity, they ceased the investigation and tendered bills for approximately $3,500 to Wife.Â  \r\nThe court found private investigator fees to be a proper area of consideration, but stated it had already considered these fees in awarding Wife attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The family court is authorized to order payment of suit money to either party in a divorce.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-120 &amp; -130 (1985&nbsp;&amp; Supp. 2005).Â  Reimbursable expenses include reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in obtaining evidence of a spouseâ€™s infidelity.Â  See Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, 415, 368 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1988).Â  Because Wife proved Husbandâ€™s adultery, we find the family court erred in failing to award Wifeâ€™s private investigator fees, which were incurred to prove Husbandâ€™s adultery.Â  We therefore award Wife $3,500 to be paid by Husband within ninety days of this opinion.\r\nAs to the attorneyâ€™s fees, we find no error.Â  Wife accrued $17,410.22 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The family court ordered Husband to pay $7,500 to Wife for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Wife asserts that the award of attorneyâ€™s fees was unreasonable because the family court failed to consider all of the proper factors.Â  \r\nAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees rests within the sound discretion of the trial court and should not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Doe v. Doe, 319 S.C. 151, 157, 459 S.E.2d 892, 896 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  The family court is given broad discretion in this area.Â  Id.Â  The family court, in determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, should consider each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fees, the beneficial results obtained, the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions, and the effect of the fee on the partiesâ€™ standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  In determining the reasonable amount of attorneyâ€™s fees to award, the court should consider the nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered, the time necessarily devoted to the case, counselâ€™s professional standing, the contingency of compensation, the beneficial results obtained, and the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).\r\nThe family court considered the relevant factors in making an award of attorneyâ€™s fees and in setting the amount.Â  The court considered the beneficial results obtained by Wife, Husbandâ€™s fault in the divorce, and the financial situation of the parties.Â  We find no abuse of discretion by the family court and affirm the award of $7,500 for Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\n AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.Â  \r\n GOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-176","title":"Pasley v.

Huger, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Marvin Pasley (Husband) appeals a family court order asserting the court erred in determining four vehicles purchased by Husband after the date of filing and income earned by Husband from his sole proprietorship after the date of filing constituted marital property, in failing to reduce the value of the marital estate by the amount of outstanding tax debt, and in awarding retroactive alimony.Â  We affirm in part and remand in part.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nHusband and Carrie Pasley (Wife) were married on May 23, 1987 and separated on May 27, 1999.Â  Shortly after the marriage, Husband began serving as a Minister in the African American Episcopal Church.Â  In 1989, Wife was diagnosed with sarcoidosis.Â  Wife worked as a dental hygienist at the time the parties married and continued to work in this field for approximately twenty years, until Wife ultimately became disabled.Â  Wife also performed various functions in her role as a ministerâ€™s wife.Â  In 1995 Pasleyâ€™s Mortuary was opened, with Husband as the sole-proprietor of the business.[1]Â  Wife began working at the funeral home business in 1994, prior to its opening, and continued to work there until the latter part of 2000.Â  In addition to the sarcoidosis, and a stroke she suffered in 1999, Wife suffers from depression, anxiety disorder, sleep apnea, chronic sinusitis, a spastic colon, acid reflux, a hiatal hernia, and damaged lungs.Â  \r\nOn March 21, 2001, Wife filed a complaint seeking, among other things, a divorce based on the partiesâ€™ one-year separation, alimony, equitable distribution, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Husband answered and counterclaimed for a divorce on the ground of adultery.Â  Following a hearing in April 2001, the family court issued a temporary order awarding Wife $600 per month in alimony and temporary attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Because the trial began in December of 2003 and did not conclude until March 2004, the family court issued an interim order on December 19, 2003 increasing Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation to $1,400 per month based on Husbandâ€™s stipulation to his greater income than reported on his financial declaration filed in January 2003.Â  \r\nAt the conclusion of the hearing on March 16, 2004, the family court judge found Husband â€œhas lied to this court and tried to hide income.â€Â  The court ordered that assets in a First Citizens account be frozen, and prohibited the use of the account until further order of the court.Â  \r\nOn April 1, 2004, the family court issued its final order granting Wife a divorce based on one yearâ€™s separation.Â  In its order, the court found Husband secreted approximately $192,000.00 in a bank account which Husband â€œrefused to disclose or discuss during the pendency of this litigation,â€ and which was only discovered by Wife the day before the last day of trial.Â  The family court found Wife was completely disabled.Â  It further held, while Husband claimed on the last day of trial that he earned only $20,000 a year as a minister and profit of $13,142 a year from the funeral home business, Husbandâ€™s testimony was incredible, and based on Husbandâ€™s receipt of over $70,000 in cash from the funeral business in 2003, as well as the money in the First Citizens account, Husband was earning in excess of $80,000 a year for the past three years.Â  The family court therefore determined Wife was entitled to permanent, periodic alimony in the amount of $1,900 a month, as well as $42,300 in back alimony from the time of filing.Â  The court further found that the partiesâ€™ marital property consisted of the following:Â  (1) personal effects, which were divided by agreement of the parties; (2) the marital home with a net equity of $63,184; (3) Pasleyâ€™s Mortuary with a net equity of $66,100; (4) Husbandâ€™s retirement account valued at $22,330.98; (5) several bank accounts amounting to $55,100; and (6) a First Citizens account with a balance of approximately $192,000.Â  The court awarded the marital home to Wife, the funeral business to Husband, and ordered a 50% division of the remaining marital assets.Â  The court further awarded Wife the entire amount of her attorneyâ€™s fees and costs of $22,420.Â  In addition to the final order, the family court issued an order in June 2004, holding Husband in contempt of court for failing to disclose the existence of the First Citizens account.Â  Thereafter, Husband made a motion to alter or amend the judgment.[2]Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has Â Â  authority to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 283, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002). Â This broad scope of review does not, however, require us to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102 (2005).Â  Neither are we required to ignore the fact that the family court, which saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marital Property\r\nHusband first claims the family court erred in determining what assets constitute the marital estate.Â  He raises two issues in this respect.Â  Husband asserts error in the inclusion of four vehicles valued at $30,300 that were purchased for the funeral home after the date of filing.Â  He also asserts error in the inclusion of monies in the First Citizens account beyond the initial deposit of $63,432.\r\nMarital property is generally defined as all real and personal property acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation, regardless of how legal title is held.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2005).Â  For purposes of equitable distribution, the value of marital property is thus the value of the property at the time of the commencement of the marital litigation.Â  Arnal v. Arnal, 363 S.C. 268, 292-93, 609 S.E.2d 821, 834 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  However, both parties are entitled to share in any appreciation or depreciation that occurs to marital property after separation but before divorce.Â  Id. at 293, 609 S.E.2d at 834.\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Vehicles\r\nHusband presented evidence that he purchased the vehicles in 2002 and 2003, after Wife commenced this divorce proceeding on March 21, 2001.Â  He contends, because it is uncontested the vehicles were all purchased after the date of filing, they are clearly nonmarital and should not have been included in the marital estate.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe family court found the funeral home business was a marital asset owned by Husband and Wife.Â  In determining the value of the funeral home, the family court found it included (1) $100,000 for the land and building, (2) $3,800 for furniture, fixture and equipment, (3) $30,300 for the four vehicles, based on Husbandâ€™s appraised value, and (4) an outstanding mortgage of $68,000, for a net equity in the business of $66,100.Â  On appeal, Husband asserts the family court erred in including the $30,300, as the vehicles were not owned at the date of filing of marital litigation and were therefore nonmarital property.Â  Wife counters that the newly purchased vehicles only replaced similar assets already owned by the business before filing.Â  We find no error in the inclusion of these vehicles in the marital estate.Â  \r\nFirst, there is evidence of record that clearly shows Husband routinely purchased vehicles for use in the business.Â  He testified he had purchased about five or six hearses alone in the past, and stated he had never been able to purchase brand-new hearses, but only used ones, and after the old ones stopped running, he would â€œget ridâ€ of them.Â  Further, the testimony of record shows there was a previous appraisal showing a value of $15,375 for funeral home vehicles, which Husband testified was for older vehicles than those on the present appraisal, and the $15,375 figure was â€œa good faith estimate . . . at that time.â€Â  Husband also admitted that â€œa lot of the cash that [he] pulled out of the business was to purchase vehicles.â€Â  While there is no indication in the testimony as to when the vehicles on this previous appraisal were purchased,[3] there is sufficient evidence for the court to conclude that the funeral home has always operated with the use of limousines and hearses.Â  Finally, common sense dictates that the business could not have operated without the use of support vehicles.Â  Therefore, we agree with Wife that the vehicles included in the value of the business were, at the very least, replacement vehicles.Â  Further, we find any appreciation in the business resulting from the addition of the new vehicles was properly included in the marital estate.Â  See Hatfield v. Van Epps, 358 S.C. 185, 194, 594 S.E.2d 526, 531 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œ[T]he parties to domestic litigation are entitled to share in any appreciation or depreciation in marital assets occurring after separation but before divorce.â€); Bowman v. Bowman, 357 S.C. 146, 159 n.8, 591 S.E.2d 654, 661 n.8 (Ct. App. 2004) (recognizing that â€œpassive post-filing changes in the appreciation or depreciation of marital assets may be considered by the family court in determining an equitable apportionment of the marital estate.â€); Dixon v. Dixon, 334 S.C. 222, 228, 512 S.E.2d 539, 542 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œIt is an unfortunate reality that, given the volume of cases handled by our family courts, there often is a substantial delay between the commencement of an action and its ultimate resolution.Â  Thus, it is not unusual for the value of marital assets to change, sometimes substantially, between the time the action was commenced and its final resolution.Â  In such a case, the family court has the ability to consider the post-filing appreciation or depreciation when valuing and apportioning the marital estate.â€).\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  First Citizens Account\r\nThe issue concerning the secreted account is more complicated.Â  The record shows the final hearing on the partiesâ€™ divorce was held over several days in December 2003, January 2004, and March 2004.Â  During the hearing in December, Husband apparently did not appear for medical reasons.Â  When the hearing continued in January 2004, Husband appeared and testified on his own behalf.Â  Husband claimed, that for tax year 2001, his tax return reflected the funeral business had net earnings of only $3,140.Â  Husband further maintained his salary as a minister in 2001 was approximately $20,000.Â  Husband testified that in tax year 2002, his church salary dropped when he was assigned to another church and he earned between $379 and $500 a week during that time.Â  He claimed the funeral business netted a profit of only $6,093 in 2002, and that he put all of that money back into the business.Â  Husband testified he had â€œ[n]o other income from anywhere.â€Â  Husband also claimed he had approximately $359 in his personal account at First Federal, and he did not have any personal funds in any other account.Â  \r\nThe trial resumed on March 16, 2004, with Husband still on the stand.Â  Husband admitted, that after his initial cross-examination, he filed an amended tax return for 2002 reflecting earnings of $13,142 for the funeral business during that tax year.Â  During redirect examination, Husband disclosed the existence of another account.Â  Counsel asked Husband if he knew someone by the name of Oneil Wilder.Â  Husband testified Wilder was a friend of his, and stated he handled some of Wilderâ€™s business affairs.Â  When asked if he handled an account for Wilder, Husband stated Wilder had an account with Husbandâ€™s name on it.Â  When asked if the money in the account belonged to Wilder, Husband claimed part of the money was Wilderâ€™s, and that Wilder â€œput me down as a signer for it.â€Â  Husband claimed both his and Wilderâ€™s money was deposited into the account, he did not know what money was his and what money belonged to Wilder, and he believed Wilder deposited around $80,000 into the account.Â  When asked how the account was started, Husband maintained that Wilder put around $80,000 in the account originally, and that Husband did not put anything in there at that time, but he periodically made deposits into the account.Â  Husband stated he did not know the exact amount of money in the account at that time.Â  On cross-examination, Husband acknowledged he made various deposits into the account and wrote numerous checks out of the account.Â  Husband maintained he wrote many of the checks to pay funeral business bills.Â  He claimed at least one of the deposits made into the account was from money he took out of the funeral home account.Â  When asked where he obtained the money that he deposited into the First Citizens account, Husband stated he had worked since he and Wife separated, implying the money deposited into this account was from his post-separation earnings.Â  \r\nOn April 1, 2004, the family court issued its final order finding the First Citizens account was a marital asset that was to be equitably divided.Â  The court included the approximately $192,000 in the account in the marital estate and found the marital estate should be divided equally between the parties.Â  On this date, the family court also held a hearing on Husbandâ€™s Citation for Contempt.Â  Thereafter, on June 22, 2004, the family court issued its order finding Husband in contempt of court based on his willful testimony regarding and his nondisclosure of the First Citizens account.Â  The court fined husband $1,500 and ordered him incarcerated for six months, with the detention held in abeyance conditioned upon Husbandâ€™s performance of three hundred hours of community service.Â  The record does not contain any transcript from the contempt hearing.\r\nOn April 12, 2004, Husband filed a motion to alter or amend the final order of divorce.Â  In that motion, Husband argued, among other things, that the family court erroneously included monies from the First Citizens account that were acquired by him as income after the date of filing of marital litigation.Â  While Husbandâ€™s motion is included within the record before us, there is no transcript from any hearing on the motion, nor is there any order from the family court showing disposition of the motion. \r\nOn appeal, Husband alleges that the First Citizens account, with a balance of $192,053, should not have been considered as marital property beyond the $63,432 initially used to open the account a few days after Wife filed for divorce.Â  He asserts the account included his income earned after the date of filing, and that it was his earnings and savings that made the account grow to a balance of $192,053.Â  Thus, he contends that $128,621 of the total balance in the account constitutes nonmarital earnings and this amount should be deducted from the marital estate.Â  Wife counters that the $128,621 is either marital property, or it is non-marital property subject to equitable apportionment by virtue of Husbandâ€™s actions which transmuted it into marital property, or that she is entitled to a special equity in the $128,621.Â  Wife does not explain why the $128,621 is marital property, but generally argues that she is entitled to equitable distribution of this amount because she made significant contributions to the business and because Husband used $63,432 in marital assets to continue to operate the funeral business, thereby allowing the accumulation of $128,621 more in the account.Â  \r\nHusband concedes that it was reasonable for the family court to conclude the initial deposit of $63,432 in the account was marital.Â  The only evidence of record before us as to the source of the other deposits is from husbandâ€™s testimony that at least one deposit of $3,000 came out of the funeral home account, and Husbandâ€™s general testimony that other deposits resulted from his work in the business.Â  However, Husband admittedly perjured himself during his testimony and his credibility is, at the very least, suspect.\r\nThe family court did not explain why it determined the entire $192,000 account was marital property.Â  Based on the record before us, it is impossible for this court to determine whether the entire account was found to have been marital based upon the source of the initial deposit as well as the source of subsequent deposits, whether the court determined the initial deposit was marital and the rest of the account was transmuted into marital property by virtue of Husbandâ€™s commingling of funds, or whether the court had some other basis for finding the entire account was marital.Â  While the Wife asserts, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473(5) (Supp. 2005),[4] she is entitled to â€œany increase in value in nonmarital property . . . result[ing] directly or indirectly from [her efforts] during the marriageâ€ and that a special equity was thereby created in the $128,621, there was no finding by the family court to support this argument.Â  Additionally, the $128,621 would not qualify as an increase in value of nonmarital property, as the family court determined the entire account was marital.[5]\r\nIt is uncontested the initial deposit is marital property.Â  It is also clear at least some portion of the initial deposit generated interest to increase the account.Â  Thus, wife is undoubtedly entitled, at a minimum, to an equitable share in the initial deposit and any appreciation resulting directly from the initial deposit in the form of interest.Â  See Hatfield v. Van Epps, 358 S.C. 185, 194, 594 S.E.2d 526, 531 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œ[T]he parties to domestic litigation are entitled to share in any appreciation or depreciation in marital assets occurring after separation but before divorce.â€)Â  However, there is an insufficiency or paucity of evidence and rulings in the record for this court to determine the basis of the family courtâ€™s classification of the entire asset as marital property.Â  Accordingly, we remand this issue to the family court for a determination of what portion of the total account is marital and what portion, if any, is income of the Husband that would not be subject to equitable apportionment, with leave for the court to take additional testimony on the source and use of the funds in this account.Â  The family court shall exclude any income in the account attributable to earnings by Husband after the date of filing. Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTax Debt \r\nHusband claims the family court erred in failing to reduce the value of the marital estate by the amount of outstanding tax debt resulting from his filing of amended tax returns.Â  He asserts the amended returns revised his taxable income resulting in tax liabilities of $29,786 for tax year 2000, $30,623 for tax year 2001, and $34,408 for tax year 2002.Â  Husband argues the family court was required to consider and apportion the marital debt in conjunction with its apportionment of the assets.Â  He maintains the family court should have equally divided the marital tax debt, which included $29,786 for the 2000 tax year and a pro-rata share of $30,623 from tax year 2001, which should be computed as of the date of filing.Â  \r\nâ€œMarital debt, like marital property, must be specifically identified and apportioned in equitable distribution.â€Â  Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 546, 615 S.E.2d 98, 105 (2005).Â  â€œMarital debt should be divided in accord with the same principles used in the division of marital property and must be factored into the totality of equitable apportionment.â€Â  Pirayesh v. Pirayesh, 359 S.C. 284, 300, 596 S.E.2d 505, 514 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  In apportioning the marital estate, the family court â€œmust give weight in such proportion as it finds appropriateâ€ to â€œliens and any other encumbrances upon the marital property, which themselves must be equitably divided, or upon the separate property of either of the parties, and any other existing debts incurred by the parties or either of them during the course of the marriage.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472(13) (Supp. 2005); Wooten, 364 S.C. at 546, 615 S.E.2d at 105.Â  If the family court finds a debt was not incurred for marital purposes, it need not be factored into the courtâ€™s equitable apportionment of the marital estate, and the court may require payment by the spouse who created the debt for nonmarital purposes.Â  Hickum v. Hickum, 320 S.C. 97, 103, 463 S.E.2d 321, 324 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  The apportionment of marital property is within the discretion of the family court judge and his decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Pirayesh, 359 S.C. at 300, 596 S.E.2d at 514.Â  â€œ[T]he words â€˜in such proportion as it finds appropriate,â€™ as used in Â§ 20-7-472, accord much discretion to the trial judge in providing for the payment of marital debts as a consideration in the equitable division of the marital estate.â€Â  Hickum v. Hickum, 320 S.C. at 103, 463 S.E.2d at 324.Â  On review, the appellate court will look to the fairness of the overall apportionment.Â  Id.  \r\nWe agree with Husband that the family court was required to consider and apportion any marital debt in conjunction with its apportionment of the assets.[6]Â  However, we disagree with Husbandâ€™s assertion that the family court was required to equally divide the tax obligation.Â  See Pirayesh, 359 S.C. at 300, 596 S.E.2d at 514 (wherein this court found no error in the family courtâ€™s failure to equally split the partiesâ€™ debts between them).Â  Rather, the family court has much discretion in apportioning the debt in such proportion as it finds appropriate.Â  We further note, while the initial tax obligation for 2000 and the portion of 2001 prior to filing may have been incurred for the joint benefit of the parties, the same cannot be said of the penalties and interest assessed on the tax obligations.Â  Rather, penalties and interest were incurred, not for the benefit of the marriage, but because of Husbandâ€™s failure to initially file a correct return reflecting his true income.Â  We thus find any penalties and interest should be the sole responsibility of Husband.Â  Accordingly, we remand this matter to the family court to determine what tax debts were incurred for the benefit of the marriage and to apportion any such debt consistent with this opinion.[7]Â Â Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRetroactive Alimony \r\nFinally, Husband complains the family court erred in awarding Wife retroactive alimony because the award constituted a double recovery for Wife.Â  He argues the family court found he made in excess of $80,000 based upon evidence of his receipt of over $70,000 in cash from the funeral business in 2003, as well as money deposited in the First Citizens account.Â  Accordingly, the court concluded it was appropriate to relate Husbandâ€™s receipt of this income back to the time of filing, and calculated back alimony due of $42,300.Â  Husband asserts the family court implicitly held his earnings after the date of filing constituted a marital asset subject to division and additionally required Husband to pay back alimony out of these same funds.Â  He thus contends it was error for the court to award retroactive alimony based on these earnings while also treating the $128,621 earned income in the First Citizens account as a marital asset, as this amounts to a double recovery to Wife.Â  Because we have remanded the issue of the First Citizens account to the family court with instructions to exclude any income in the account that was earned by Husband after the filing date, any of the complained of double recovery by the Wife will be eliminated.Â  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REMANDED IN PART.Â  \r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]The business is referred to as both Pasleyâ€™s Mortuary and Pasleyâ€™s Funeral Home throughout the transcript.Â  \r\n[2]There is no evidence in the record that the family court ever ruled on this motion.\r\n[3]The testimony regarding the $15,375 appraisal refers to Plaintiffâ€™s Exhibit 12, which is not included in the record on appeal.Â  We note that the burden is upon appellant to provide a sufficient record from which this court can make an adequate review.Â  See Wint v. Wint, 310 S.C. 48, 50, 425 S.E.2d 48, 50 (Ct. App. 1992). \r\n[4]This code section provides â€œ[t]he term â€˜marital propertyâ€™ as used in this article means all real and personal property which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation . . ., except the following, which constitute nonmarital property: . . . (5) any increase in value in nonmarital property, except to the extent that the increase resulted directly or indirectly from efforts of the other spouse during marriage.â€\r\n[5]We note in Cannon v. Cannon, 321 S.C. 44, 467 S.E.2d 132 (Ct. App. 1996), this court determined where one spouse used marital funds to purchase property after the commencement of marital litigation, the family court properly awarded the other spouse a special equity in the property.Â  However, we recognized in Cannon that the thirty-nine acres of property acquired after the filing date but purchased with marital funds was nonmarital property as it did not exist at the time of filing.Â  Here, the family court found the First Citizens account was marital property.Â  Neither party challenges the determination that at least the initial deposit of funds was marital property.Â  Accordingly, it is the law of the case.Â  Bakala v. Bakala, 352 S.C. 612, 632, 576 S.E.2d 156, 166 (2003); Haselden v. Haselden, 347 S.C. 48, 59, 552 S.E.2d 329, 334 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\n[6]We note that it does not appear in the record before us that the issue of tax debt was raised until Husbandâ€™s motion to alter or amend.Â  It is not clear when the revised tax liabilities were admitted into evidence, but it appears this may have occurred April 1, 2004 during the contempt hearing.Â  Husband did raise the issue in his motion to alter or amend.Â  However, as previously noted, there is no transcript from either the contempt hearing or from any hearing on Husbandâ€™s motion to alter or amend in the record.Â  Neither is there an order on the motion to alter or amend. Â \r\n[7]As an additional issue, Husband argues, assuming the family court correctly included his post-filing earnings and acquisition of new assets in the marital estate, the value of the marital estate should have been reduced by the entire amount of the tax obligation totaling $94,818.06 for the tax years 2000, 2001 and 2002.Â  In light of our disposition of these matters and, specifically, the remand to the family court on the post-earnings matter, we find it unnecessary to address this issue. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-177","title":"Wells Fargo Home Mortgage v.

(Wells Fargo) initiated a foreclosure action against Salas.Â  Salas failed to make payments to Wells Fargo on a note secured by a mortgage covering Salasâ€™s property in Greenville County (the Property).Â  Copies of the summons, complaint, and lis pendens were left with Salasâ€™s step-son, Joe Wigerman, at the Property address.Â  At the time, Wigerman was eleven or twelve years old.\r\nOn April 12, 2004, Wells Fargo filed an affidavit of default against Salas.Â  After a hearing, the master issued an order granting Wells Fargoâ€™s action to foreclose the mortgage and directing the sale of the Property at a public auction.Â  The order required that at the time of the sale the master obtain from the bidder a deposit of five percent of the amount of the bid.Â  The order also provided that if the bidder failed to comply with the terms of the sale within twenty days after the date of sale, the five percent deposit would be forfeited and applied to Salasâ€™s debt to Wells Fargo. \r\nAt the judicial sale, the Property was sold to Family Home Solutions, LLC (Family Home).Â  Although the order required full compliance by September 21, 2004, Family Home did not fully comply until September 23, 2004â€”more than twenty days after the date of sale, but only two days after the set date for compliance.Â  Salas moved to set aside the default judgment and the sale of the Property.Â  The master denied both motions.Â  Salas appealed.Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe grant or denial of relief from a final judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b), SCRCP, is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Thompson v. Hammond, 299 S.C. 116, 119, 382 S.E.2d 900, 902-03 (1989).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the courtâ€™s order is controlled by an error of law or unsupported by the evidence.Â  Id.Â  An action to set aside a judicial property sale is equitable in nature.Â  Spillers v. Clay, 233 S.C. 99, 102, 103 S.E.2d 759, 760 (1958); Fed. Natâ€™l Mortgage Assâ€™n v. Brooks, 304 S.C. 506, 512, 405 S.E.2d 604, 607 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  In an equitable action, the appellate court may review the evidence to determine the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance evidence.Â  Hayne Fed. Credit Union v. Bailey, 327 S.C. 242, 248, 489 S.E.2d 472, 475 (1997).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSalas argues the master committed reversible error in denying his motions to set aside the default judgment and the judicial sale of the Property.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Motion to Set Aside Default JudgmentÂ  \r\nSalas asserts the master erred in denying his motion to set aside the default judgment because service upon his step-son was improper.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 4(d), SCRCP, provides service upon an individual must be made â€œby delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to him personally or by leaving copies thereof at his dwelling house or usual place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein. . . .â€Â  The plaintiff carries the burden of showing that the trial court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant.Â  Jensen v. Doe, 292 S.C. 592, 594, 358 S.E.2d 148, 148 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  If the plaintiff complies with the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, however, proper service is presumed.Â  Fassett v. Evans, 364 S.C. 42, 47, 610 S.E.2d 841, 843 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Accordingly, an officerâ€™s return of process creates a legal presumption of proper service that cannot be impeached by the mere denial of service by the defendant.Â  Id.\r\nService was proper in this case.Â  After Wells Fargo filed an affidavit of service attesting to proper service upon a person of suitable age and discretion, the burden then shifted to Salas to show his step-son, Wigerman, was not a person of suitable age and discretion.Â  Salas introduced no evidence demonstrating Wigerman was not a person of suitable age and discretion.Â  Salas did not proffer Wigermanâ€™s testimony; he merely denied personally receiving the summons and complaint.Â  As Fassett makes clear, an officerâ€™s return of process creates a presumption of proper service that cannot be rebutted by Salasâ€™s mere denial of service by Wells Fargo.Â  Accordingly, the master did not abuse his discretion in denying Salasâ€™s motion to set aside the default judgment for improper service.Â Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Motion to Set Aside Sale of Property \r\nSalas next argues the judicial sale should be vacated or set aside because the successful bidder at the sale did not timely comply with the bid as required by the masterâ€™s order of foreclosure.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe terms of sale, as set forth in the order of foreclosure and notice of sale, provide that the successful bidder must comply with the terms of the bid within twenty days of the close of the bidding process.Â  The terms of sale also provide that if the successful bidder does not comply within the twenty day period, the bidderâ€™s deposit will be forfeited and applied first to costs and then to Salasâ€™s debt.Â  In this case, it is undisputed that the successful bidder, Family Home, was two days late in paying the balance of its bid to the master.Â  The issue is whether this irregularity required the master to set aside the judicial sale of the Property. \r\nThe terms of judicial sales are set by court order, Rule 71, SCRCP, and statute.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-39-10 to -900 (2005); Ex parte Moore v. Fairfield Real Estate Co., 352 S.C. 508, 510, 575 S.E.2d 561, 562 (2003); Ex parte Keller v. Hutto, 185 S.C. 283, 292-93, 194 S.E.2d 15, 18 (1937).Â  Bidders at judicial sales are charged with notice of the terms of sale and the selling officer has no authority to vary the terms set forth in the order of sale.Â  Hudson v. Inman, 179 S.C. 399, 404, 184 S.E.2d 102, 104 (1936).Â  Moreover, â€œalthough selling officers may not alter the terms of the court order, they are given wide discretion in the manner in which they conduct judicial sales.â€Â  Ex parte Moore, 352 S.C. at 510-11, 575 S.E.2d at 562.Â  Nevertheless, while case law makes clear that the â€œselling officer acts in a ministerial capacity as the arm of the courtâ€ and â€œin no way acts in a judicial capacity,â€ Fed. Natâ€™l Mortgage Assâ€™n v. Brooks, 304 S.C. 506, 510, 405 S.E.2d 604, 606 (Ct. App. 1991), in practice, the line between the selling and judicial functions has been blurred because the master may now serve in both capacities.Â  \r\nA motion to vacate a judicial sale is equitable in nature and is addressed to the sound discretion of the court. Â Spillers v. Clay, 233 S.C. 99, 102, 103 S.E.2d 759, 760 (1958).Â  Courts are reluctant to set aside judicial sales on technical grounds.Â  Wooten v. Search, 187 S.C. 219, 223, 196 S.E. 877, 879 (1938).Â  The policy of our courts is to sustain a judicial sale when to do so does not violate principles of justice.Â  Cumbie v. Newberry, 251 S.C. 33, 37, 159 S.E.2d 915, 917 (1968); Brownlee v. Miller, 208 S.C. 252, 265, 37 S.E.2d 658, 663 (1946).Â  Thus, unless otherwise void, a judicial sale will not be set aside absent some special ground such as fraud, collusion, accident, mutual mistake, breach of trust, gross inadequacy of price, or misconduct on the part of the purchaser or selling officer.Â  Raleigh &amp; C.R. Co. v. Ballentine Natâ€™l Bank, 41 F. Supp. 599, 601 (D.S.C. 1941); see also 47 Am. Jur. 2d Judicial Sales Â§ 359 (1995); 50A C.J.S. Judicial Sales Â§ 76 (1997).Â  Therefore, a judicial sale will not be set aside because of a mere irregularity in the proceedings of the sale, unless the party seeking to set aside the sale would be manifestly prejudiced by the irregularity.Â  Wooten, 187 S.C. 219 at 222, 196 S.E. at 878 (1938); 50A C.J.S. Judicial Sales Â§ 77 (1997). \r\nWhile there is a dearth of cases from this jurisdiction squarely on issue, in the case of Yates v. Gridley, 16 S.C. 496, 504 (1882), the court held that a bidder who was required to comply with his bid on the day of sale, but complied more than a month later, would not forfeit his bid in the absence of fraud or collusion after he had received title to the property.Â  Likewise, in the case of McFarlen v. Edwards, 456 So.2d 818, 819-20 (Ala. Civ. App. 1984), the court held that a ten day delay by the purchaser in paying the bid price was not such an irregularity to warrant setting aside the sale since the bidder testified he was able to pay cash on the day of sale.Â  \r\nThe guiding philosophy of our courts in deciding whether to interfere with a judicial sale is to determine whether the conduct of the sale was fair and regular so as to ensure the property was sold for the highest price obtainable.Â  Howell v. Gibson, 208 S.C. 19, 31, 375 S.E.2d 271, 276 (1946).Â  This is not a case where Salas claims misconduct on the part of the purchaser or that the selling officer chilled the bidding.Â  Thus, we look to the consequences of the late compliance to determine if Salas has been prejudiced.\r\nSalas contends he is prejudiced by the lateness of the purchaserâ€™s compliance because if the deposit had been forfeited, and the property resold for the same sales price it sold for initially, most of the forfeited deposit would have been credited to his debt.Â  However, it is speculation on Salasâ€™s part that the property would have sold a second time for the same amount it sold for the first time.Â  Furthermore, it appears there were several secondary creditors of Salas who were entitled to any surplus that may have been generated from a resale of the property, though the amounts of their claims are not set forth in the record on appeal.\r\nAccordingly, Salas has not shown how he was prejudiced by the late payment of the bid price, and will not be heard to complain of a mere irregularity that did not affect the fairness of the judicial sale.Â  Johnson Cotton Co. v. Cannon, 242 S.C. 42, 55, 129 S.E.2d 750, 757 (1963).Â  Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial courtâ€™s order is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, JJ., AND CURETON, A.J., CONCUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-178","title":"Charleston County DSS v.

Warder, Jr., for Father.\r\nFramptonÂ  Durban, Jr., of N. Charleston, for Respondent.\r\nMargaret M. Urbanic, for Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM.:Â  This is an action for termination of the parental rights of the mother and the father to their biological child, a son born on November 26, 1996.Â  Both parents appeal.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) instituted a protective services action on January 18, 2000, following allegations of sexual abuse by the father.Â  The family court placed the child in emergency protective custody on March 3, 2000, and, after hearing a removal action, prescribed a treatment plan for both the mother and the father.Â  Although the father never attended any counseling session, the mother completed the process.Â  As a result, the family court, following a review hearing on November 19, 2001, allowed her to take possession of her son, but enjoined her from allowing any unauthorized contact between the child and the father.Â  Several months later, on April 9, 2002, however, DSS determined unauthorized contact between the child and the father had occurred and removed the child from the motherâ€™s physical possession without resort to legal process.\r\nIn an order dated December 9, 2004, the family court found the best interests of the child required termination of the parental rights of both the mother and the father.Â  This followed findings that both the mother and father had willfully failed for a period in excess of six month to meet the conditions imposed by the court for them to visit the child and that the child had been in foster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months.Â  The family court also found the father had failed to remedy the conditions that caused the childâ€™s removal and had failed to support the child for a period in excess of six months.Â  After the family court denied the motherâ€™s post-trial motion to alter or amend, the mother and the father filed separate appeals.[2]\r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  We find no error in the family courtâ€™s determination that the removal by DSS of the child on April 9, 2002, which took place with neither a court order nor the assistance of law enforcement, did not violate South Carolina Code sections 20-7-480 et seq. (Supp. 2005).Â  DSS already had â€œlegal custodyâ€ of the child by virtue of an earlier family court order dated December 10, 2001.Â  Although the latter order â€œplacedâ€ the child with the mother, it did not grant her legal custody of the child.[3]Â  Moreover, the family court in its December 10, 2001 order expressly authorized DSS â€œto take whatever action they [sic] deem necessary for the immediate health and welfare of the child.â€\r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  We do not address the argument made by DSS that any issue regarding the removal of the child on April 9, 2002, is moot.\r\n3.Â Â Â Â Â Â  We affirm the family courtâ€™s finding that DSS did not violate the motherâ€™s right to due process.Â  As noted above, the family court awarded DSS custody of the child in its order dated December 10, 2001.Â  Furthermore, the family court, as the record demonstrates, afforded the mother several opportunities to be heard on the issue of custody.Â  Indeed, the mother appeared with counsel in court no less than four times to contest the question of the childâ€™s custody.Â  On two of these occasions, she consented to the child remaining in the custody of DSS.[4]Â  Moreover, although the mother could have appealed a permanency planning order issued by the family court on January 31, 2003, she did not avail herself of this procedure.[5]\r\n4.Â Â Â Â Â Â  We uphold the family courtâ€™s finding that DSS proved by clear and convincing evidence that the mother willfully failed to visit the child for a period in excess of six months when visitation was available to her upon satisfaction of reasonable conditions.Â  The record contains evidence to support this finding.[6]Â  The foster care worker assigned to the case testified agency rules required requests for visitation to be documented and she was unaware of any requests by the mother for visitation since April 9, 2002.\r\n5.Â Â Â Â Â Â  The family court did not rule on the motherâ€™s argument questioning the constitutionality of South Carolina Code section 20-7-1572(8), which allows the termination of parental rights to serve the childâ€™s best interests if the child has been in State foster care for â€œfifteen of the most recent twenty-two months.â€[7]Â  Although the mother moved to alter or amend the judgment, her motion does not raise this issue.Â  Under these circumstances, this court cannot address the constitutionality of section 20-7-1572(8).[8]\r\n6.Â Â Â Â Â Â  We further hold the family courtâ€™s application of section 20-7-1572(8) to terminate the motherâ€™s parental rights was proper notwithstanding the motherâ€™s remaining arguments, all of which concern numerous procedural delays and the lack of evidence of misconduct or parental unfitness on her part.Â  \r\nAlthough several hearings scheduled after the childâ€™s second removal from the motherâ€™s home were continued, the postponements were ordered by the family court on its own motion.Â  There were no allegations that the delays resulted from dilatory tactics by DSS.Â  \r\nAs to the evidence concerning the motherâ€™s fitness as a parent, we find it significant that, whereas several of the other grounds for termination of parental rights require a finding of willful misconduct by the parent,[9] such a requirement is lacking in section 20-7-1572(8).Â  As this court recently stated, â€œthe purpose of [section 20-7-1572(8)] is to ensure children do not languish in foster care when termination of parental rights would be in their best interests.â€[10]Â  Because this section does not enumerate any factors that would militate against its application if the threshold requirement is satisfied, we hold the absence of fault on the parentâ€™s part cannot prevent its use as a ground for termination.[11]\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ. concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Counsel for the father filed an affidavit pursuant to Ex Parte Cauthen, 291 S.C. 465, 354 S.E.2d 381 (1987).Â  In his affidavit, counsel stated he reviewed the existing transcript and, coupled with his recollection and knowledge of the proceedings, believed the appeal lacks merit. The father filed no response to counselâ€™s affidavit.Â  We have determined from our own review of the entire transcript that there exists no meritorious issue regarding the family courtâ€™s termination of the fatherâ€™s parental rights to the child in question that warrants briefing and dismiss the appeal as to the father.Â  \r\n[3]Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-490(21) (Supp. 2005) (defining the term â€œlegal custodyâ€ for the purposes of the Childrenâ€™s Code to mean, among other things, â€œthe right to the physical custody, care, and control of a childâ€ and â€œthe right to determine where the child shall liveâ€).Â  \r\n[4]Â  See S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Beeks, 325 S.C. 243, 246, 481 S.E.2d 703, 705 (1997) (â€œThe fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.â€).\r\n[5]Â  See Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 291, 513 S.E.2d 358, 364 (1999) (â€œ[A]ny order issued as a result of a merit hearing, as well as any later order issued with regard to a treatment, placement, or permanent plan, is a final order that a party must timely appeal.â€) (emphasis added).Â  We recognize the motherâ€™s concern that the permanency planning order may not have been ripe for appeal because it was at least arguable that there had never been a full merits on the matter; however, such a serious procedural defect, if applicable, should have provided an even greater incentive for an appeal.\r\n[6]Â  See Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E. 2d 541, 541 (1981) (noting the standard of review in equity cases â€œdoes not require [the appellate court] to disregard the findings below nor ignore the better vantage point the trial judge occupies in determining witness credibilityâ€).Â  \r\n[7]Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(8) (Supp. 2005).\r\n[8]Â  See Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 403 S.E.2d 122 (1991) (holding that, when the trial court does not explicitly rule on a question and the appellant fails to move under Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to alter or amend the judgment on that ground, the issue is not properly before the court of appeals and should not be addressed).\r\n[9]Â  See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(3) (Supp. 2005) (regarding the parentâ€™s failure to visit the child); id. Â§ 20-7-1572(4) (regarding the parentâ€™s failure to support the child); id. Â§ 20-7-1572(9) (regarding physical abuse of the child by the parent); id. Â§ 20-7-1572(10) (providing as a ground of termination of parental rights an adjudication that the parent murdered the childâ€™s other parent).\r\n[10] Charleston County Depâ€™t of Social Servs. v. Jackson, Op. No. 4090 (S.C. Ct. App. filed March 6, 2006) (Shearouse Adv. Sheets at, 71, 84).Â  Unlike the parent is Jackson, the mother in the present case did not appeal the family courtâ€™s finding that termination of her parental rights was in the childâ€™s best interest.\r\n[11] In Jackson, the court further held â€œit is the childâ€™s perspective, and not the parentâ€™s, that we are concerned with when determining whether [section 20-7-1572(8)] has been metâ€ and concluded â€œthe letter of the law was met once Child resided in foster for fifteen of the last twenty-two months regardless of Fatherâ€™s knowledge of Childâ€™s whereabouts.â€Â  Id. at 84. (emphasis added).Â  We note, however, this court in Jackson recognized â€œthere may be some instances where [section 20-7-1578(8)] would not support termination of parental rights despite the passage of a fifteen month stay in foster care.â€Â  Id. at 84 n.8 (quoting Justice Pleiconesâ€™s concurring opinion in S.C.
