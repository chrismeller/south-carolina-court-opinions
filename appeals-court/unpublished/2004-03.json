McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, \r\n  Assistant Attorney General David A. Spencer, all of Columbia; and Solicitor \r\n  Walter M. Bailey, Jr., of Summerville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Norma Patrick Hall was charged \r\n  with one count of homicide by child abuse, for which she entered a plea under \r\n  North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970).Â  She appeals her sentence, \r\n  arguing the circuit court failed to consider her diminished capacity due to \r\n  drug use as a mitigating factor during sentencing.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn April 2002, Hall was indicted for one count \r\n  of homicide by child abuse in connection with the death of her six-month old \r\n  son, Harley Benjamin Hall.Â  She entered into an Alford plea agreement \r\n  and was sentenced to forty years in prison.Â  During sentencing, the circuit \r\n  court refused to consider Hallâ€™s diminished mental capacity resulting from drug \r\n  use, stating â€œThe mitigation that has been forwarded for the Courtâ€™s consideration \r\n  has been that of drug abuse.Â  As you all know, diminished capacity is no defense \r\n  in South Carolina, and in this instance I fail to find it is a mitigating circumstance.â€ \r\n  Â This appeal follows.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHall argues the circuit court erred as a matter \r\n  of law by failing to consider diminished capacity resulting from her drug use \r\n  during her sentencing phase.Â  In fact, the trial judge clearly considered that \r\n  diminished capacity resulting from drug abuse may be a mitigating factor, but \r\n  determined it was not so in the present case.Â  Moreover, Hall did not object \r\n  when the circuit court imposed its sentence.Â  Thus, the issue of the sentence \r\n  is not preserved for our review.Â  State v. Johnston, 333 S.C. 459, 462, \r\n  510 S.E.2d 423, 425 (1999) (stating that a challenge to sentencing must be raised \r\n  at trial, or the issue will not be preserved for appellate review).\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HOWARD, and KITTREDGE, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-146","title":"State v.

Wilson, Jr., of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  KCI Management Corporation \r\n  brought this declaratory judgment action to determine the rights of Malcolm \r\n  Post in properties that were part of real estate development projects. [1] Â  This action revolves around a dispute between \r\n  Post and his former business associate, Alexis Pierre Kisteneff, as to whether \r\n  Post held an interest in real property they had planned to develop.Â  The case \r\n  was tried to a jury before the Circuit Court of Greenville County on a special \r\n  interrogatory as to whether a partnership existed between Post and Kisteneff \r\n  relating to their real estate development plans.Â  The jury found they had not \r\n  entered into a partnership, thereby foreclosing Postâ€™s claim of an ownership \r\n  interest in the real estate in dispute.Â  Bara Post appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAt the center of this case is the business relationship \r\n  that developed between Kisteneff and Malcolm Post.Â  Several key facts are clear \r\n  and undisputed:Â  Both gentlemen had varying experiences in real estate speculation \r\n  and development prior to their association.Â  Both were interested in pursuing \r\n  some type of real estate venture together after they were introduced to each \r\n  other in 1995.Â  Only Kisteneff invested money in the projects; Post made no \r\n  financial contributions.Â  None of the potential projects the two men attempted \r\n  to develop together realized any profits during their association.Â  Beyond this \r\n  basic information, however, the precise nature of the business relationship \r\n  between the two is difficult to discern.Â  This task is complicated by the fact \r\n  that Post died prior to the commencement of this suit, leaving the parties to \r\n  rely primarily on the testimony of Kisteneff in its inquiry.\r\nThe record shows, in the spring of 1995, \r\n  Kisteneff â€œmetâ€ Post by telephone after John Canney, an associate of Kisteneffâ€™s, \r\n  told Kisteneff that Post was looking for someone with whom he could get back \r\n  into the real estate business.Â  At this time, the two discussed the possibility \r\n  of working together on some real estate development opportunities.Â  At the time, \r\n  Post had already identified a potential project in Quincy, Massachusetts.Â  The \r\n  Quincy project did not go through, but the two men subsequently met to discuss \r\n  another possible project in Broughton, Connecticut.Â  At this meeting, Kisteneff \r\n  claims he proposed forming a partnership with Post, but Post refused, claiming \r\n  he could not hold an ownership interest in any new venture because it would \r\n  be subject to liens due to outstanding taxes and judgments he owed.Â  Both men \r\n  then agreed that some type of arrangement would be reached among themselves \r\n  and Canney, whereby they would work together and each receive a third of any \r\n  profits from a successful project.Â  The fundamental principle behind their association \r\n  was that they would share equally in any profits, once the project was built \r\n  and succeeded in selling.Â  \r\nIn May 1995, Kisteneffâ€™s attorney drafted \r\n  a letter to John Canney, following a discussion with Post and his wife, concerning \r\n  the appropriate entity with whom the parties should contract.Â  The letter proposed \r\n  that Canney and Kisteneff prepare a letter on behalf of WAGA Investment Associates, \r\n  L.P., which would contain language whereby WAGA would agree to contract for \r\n  the services of Post.Â  The proposed language included that Post would â€œas WAGAâ€™s \r\n  Agent, negotiate the purchase and sale agreement and direct all permitting, \r\n  development and construction activities subject . . . to WAGAâ€™s supervision \r\n  and direction.â€Â  It further stated, â€œFor your [Postâ€™s] services, you will receive \r\n  one-third of cash flow arising from operations, sale or refinancing including, \r\n  without limitation, any development fee that is payable pursuant to the financing.â€Â  \r\n  The WAGA partnership was never formed after plans for the Quincy construction \r\n  project fell through.Â  However, the three discussed the letter, and, according \r\n  to Kisteneff, they all agreed that â€œit laid a good foundation for our relationship.â€Â  \r\n  Despite this false start, Kisteneff testified that:\r\n\r\n[The letter] asserted the principle \r\n  that a partnership would be formed in the event that we did develop the property \r\n  together which would be between me and Mr. [Canney], and Mr. [Canney] and I \r\n  would then turn around and contract with Mr. Post for [his] services, and that \r\n  he would participate in one third of the profit of a successful project after \r\n  he did what he was supposed to do, which was supervise construction and also \r\n  sell the units.Â  \r\n\r\nDuring cross-examination, Kisteneff was pressed \r\n  further about the agreement he had reached with Post.Â  Unable to recall precise \r\n  details, Kisteneff described their relationship after their initial personal \r\n  meeting in general terms:\r\n\r\nI do not have a specific recollection \r\n  of what was talked about in the car.Â  We were getting acquainted, and talking \r\n  about the possibilities of doing the possible project in Broughton.\r\nBut I would think it logical \r\n  that at that meeting, possibly in the car when we were tooling around Broughton, \r\n  that we came to terms on what our roles would be and what our rewards would \r\n  be. \r\nWhat our roles and rewards would \r\n  be for discharging those roles, and the fundamental principle is basically only \r\n  one, sir.Â  The fundamental principle was that we would share equally in the \r\n  profits of the project.Â  \r\n\r\nKisteneff stated he â€œagreed to compensate [Post] \r\n  for [his] participation in the process.â€Â  Kisteneff further testified, he put \r\n  the seed money into the projects and was responsible for the ultimate financing \r\n  and that he â€œhad sole control of the deals because I was the only one at risk.â€Â  \r\n\r\nAfter some investigation, and on advice of his \r\n  bank, Kisteneff decided he would not go forward on the Broughton deal.Â  Over \r\n  the next year, however, three other properties were considered for development:Â  \r\n  one in Boston, Massachusetts, one in Cranston, Rhode Island and a third in Greenville, \r\n  South Carolina. Â In August 1995, Canney and Post contacted Kisteneff \r\n  about the Boston property, and the men discussed developing single-family housing \r\n  there.Â  Post indicated he believed they could acquire the necessary permits \r\n  and break ground by March 1996.Â  Kisteneff agreed with the proposal and â€œauthorized \r\n  [Post and Canney] to get goingâ€ on the project.Â  \r\nIn September 1995, Post called Kisteneff and requested \r\n  Kisteneff advance him money in order to â€œkeep the wolf away from the door.â€Â  \r\n  Post told Kisteneff he would pay him back out of his share of the profits of \r\n  one of their deals.Â  Kisteneff arranged for his own company, KCI Management \r\n  Corporation, to advance Post $5,000 per month against his future share of any \r\n  profits realized in the Boston project.Â  These payments continued for a period \r\n  of fifteen months, through November 1996 when Kisteneff was required to turn \r\n  his financial resources toward purchase of the Boston property.Â  \r\nUnfortunately, the Boston project encountered objections \r\n  from local residents, and the City of Boston responded by drawing out the permitting \r\n  process.Â  The City ultimately denied the necessary building permits in March \r\n  1997.Â  By this time, Kisteneff had purchased the property, and he felt it necessary \r\n  to bring a lawsuit against the City of Boston for wrongful denial of the permits.Â  \r\n  Although the court ruled in Kisteneffâ€™s favor and ordered the City to issue \r\n  the permits, the City filed an appeal, preventing any further development of \r\n  the Boston property.Â  \r\nIn late 1995, Post brought to Kisteneffâ€™s attention \r\n  the property located in Cranston, Rhode Island.Â  In January 1996, Kisteneff \r\n  authorized Post to execute a purchase and sale memorandum on behalf of KCI Management \r\n  Corporation setting out a formula for the purchase of the land.Â  Post executed \r\n  the document as Vice President of KCI.Â  Although Canney, Post and Kisteneff \r\n  attempted to secure financing for the project throughout 1996, by the end of \r\n  the year, they were unable to locate the two million dollars they needed for \r\n  the project.Â  In late 1996 and early 1997, Post informed Kisteneff that the \r\n  owner of the Cranston property intended to withdraw the property from sale, \r\n  and their open-ended contract on the property was most likely unenforceable.Â  \r\n  Several months later, Post called Kisteneff and told him he planned to â€œreinsertâ€ \r\n  himself into the Cranston deal without Kisteneff.Â  After objection from Kisteneff, \r\n  Post told him he would â€œsee what [he could] do about letting [Kisteneff] into \r\n  the deal.â€Â  Apparently, Post did not include Kisteneff in the deal but had already \r\n  begun to work with someone else on the development of the property.Â  Kisteneff \r\n  testified Post went into business with this other person in January 1997, and \r\n  negotiated a $450,000 payment for the work Post had performed on the project \r\n  prior to his association with this other person.Â  According to Kisteneff, Post \r\n  also negotiated salaries for himself and his wife, along with a forty percent \r\n  share in profits on the project.Â  \r\nIn February, 1996, Post traveled to South Carolina, \r\n  at which time Kisteneff showed Post some Greenville property he was interested \r\n  in them developing together.Â  Kisteneff had been working on the Greenville property \r\n  for over a year at that time.Â  Within a week of Postâ€™s visit, Kisteneff placed \r\n  a deposit on the property.Â  \r\nBy the end of 1996, Kisteneff had spent in excess \r\n  of $600,000 and had gone into debt for $300,000, for a total of $900,000 contributed \r\n  toward the potential projects.Â  Post, however, had contributed no money to any \r\n  of the land purchases. Â \r\nKisteneff testified, as he believed they were closer \r\n  to getting the Boston project underway, he sought to formalize his working relationship \r\n  with Post.Â  Accordingly, Kisteneff proposed that he and Post form a corporation \r\n  named ALMA.Â  Post would not personally be a stockholder in the corporation because \r\n  he did not want his creditors to be able to â€œget at him,â€ so they discussed \r\n  that the corporation would formally employ Post as he worked on the various \r\n  projects.Â  In August 1996, Kisteneff had his attorney draft a series of documents \r\n  to put his proposed arrangement with Post in writing.Â  After sending those documents \r\n  to Post and his attorney in late August 1996, Post did not initially respond.Â  \r\n  After a few months, Postâ€™s attorney returned the documents with notations indicating \r\n  they would not be executed.Â  According to Kisteneff, Postâ€™s only response was \r\n  a counter-offer communicated through Postâ€™s attorney for a single project in \r\n  â€œAlma, South Carolinaâ€â€” a place that Kisteneff knew did not exist.Â  Kisteneff \r\n  questioned Post and Postâ€™s attorney regarding the proposed change in their deal, \r\n  but each responded they were merely acting on the instruction of the other.Â  \r\n  According to Kisteneff, with the exception of a March 1997 communication, Post \r\n  barely spoke to him after December 1996, shortly after he sent him the last \r\n  monthly $5,000 check.Â  Post did not call or suggest any new deals or bring Kisteneff \r\n  any new prospects.Â  At this time, Kisteneff concluded Post no longer wanted \r\n  to do business with him.Â  \r\nKisteneff testified he did not hear from Post again \r\n  until March or April 1998, when Kisteneff received a favorable ruling on the \r\n  permits issue in Boston, and â€œall of a sudden, [Post] reappeared.â€Â  On April \r\n  1, 1998, Kisteneff wrote Post a letter asking him not to interfere with Kisteneffâ€™s \r\n  negotiations of settlement with the City of Boston.Â  Post, however, would not \r\n  agree to the request.Â  By letter dated April 20, 1998 Kisteneff referred to \r\n  an April 3, 1998 conversation he had with Post, and informed Post he was â€œstunnedâ€ \r\n  to hear Post describe his version of their deal.Â  Kisterneff stated that after \r\n  loaning Post $5,000 a month for fifteen months, when â€œthe well ran dry,â€ Post \r\n  virtually dropped out of sight.Â  He then notified Post, that any relationship \r\n  between Post and KCI was terminated by Postâ€™s refusal to negotiate and define \r\n  a written agreement with KCI, despite KCIâ€™s efforts to do so.Â Â  Kisteneff further \r\n  asked Post to execute an enclosed promissory note for the repayment of the $75,000 \r\n  that had been advanced to Post, and to submit an estimate for the services Post \r\n  rendered to KCI for the Boston project.Â  \r\nIn June 1998, KCI initiated the present \r\n  declaratory judgment action in response to claims by Post that he possessed \r\n  an equitable interest in the Greenville and Boston properties.Â  While various \r\n  other causes of action were subsequently added by the parties, the only issue \r\n  submitted to the jury was whether Kisteneff and Post entered into a partnership \r\n  agreement regarding development of the real estate in question.Â  Appellant now \r\n  appeals the juryâ€™s verdict finding no partnership existed, as well as two rulings \r\n  by the trial court regarding the trial judgeâ€™s instructions to the jury.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Trial Courtâ€™s Jury Instructions\r\nAppellant first argues the trial court \r\n  erred on two occasions in instructing the jury on the law.Â  We find no reversible \r\n  error.Â  \r\nThe trial judge is required to charge the current \r\n  and correct law.Â  McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. 301, 306, 457 S.E.2d \r\n  603, 606 (1995).Â  When reviewing jury charges for error, an appellate court \r\n  must consider the courtâ€™s jury charge as a whole in light of the evidence and \r\n  issues presented at trial.Â  Keaton ex rel. Foster v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., \r\n  334 S.C. 488, 497, 514 S.E.2d 570, 575 (1999).Â  A jury charge is correct if, \r\n  when read as a whole, it contains the correct definition and adequately charges \r\n  the law.Â  Id. at 495-96, 514 S.E.2d at 574.Â  If the charges given, as \r\n  a whole, are reasonably free from error, isolated portions which might be misleading \r\n  do not constitute reversible error.Â  Id. at 497, 514 S.E.2d at 575.Â  \r\n  Further, refusal to give a properly requested charge is not error if the general \r\n  instructions are sufficiently broad to enable the jury to understand the law \r\n  and the issues involved.Â  McCourt, 318 S.C. at 306, 457 S.E.2d at 606.\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Jury Instruction on Contract LawÂ  \r\n\r\nAppellant takes exception to the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  decision to instruct the jury on the elements of contract formation.Â  She argues \r\n  this instruction was wholly irrelevant to the question of partnership formation \r\n  and thereby served to sow seeds of confusion in the jurorsâ€™ minds.Â  We disagree.\r\nA partnership is an association of two or more \r\n  persons, to carry on as co-owners a business for profit.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-41-210 \r\n  (Supp. 2003); Buffkin v. Strickland, 280 S.C. 343, 345, 312 S.E.2d 579, \r\n  580 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  A partnership agreement may rest in parole.Â  It may also \r\n  be implied and without express intention.Â  Halbersberg v. Berry, 302 \r\n  S.C. 97, 101, 394 S.E.2d 7, 10 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  A partnership is a relation \r\n  arising out of contract, and a partnership between parties arises only out of \r\n  the contract of the parties, as expressed in their agreement or implied from \r\n  their dealings with each other and others.Â  Stephens v. Stephens, 213 \r\n  S.C. 525, 531, 50 S.E.2d 577, 579 (1948).Â  One of the most important tests as \r\n  to the existence of a partnership is the intention of the parties.Â  Id. \r\n  at 530, 50 S.E.2d at 579.Â  If parties intend to and do enter into a contract \r\n  as in the eye of the law constitutes a partnership, they thereby become partners \r\n  whether they are designated as such or not in their contract.Â  Id. at \r\n  530-31, 50 S.E.2d at 579.Â  Thus, â€œwhere the parties to a contract, by their \r\n  acts, conduct, or agreement show that they intended to combine their \r\n  property, labor, skill and experience, or some of these elements on one side \r\n  and some on the other, to carry on as principals or co-owners, a common \r\n  business, trade, or venture as a commercial enterprise, and to share, either \r\n  expressly or by implication, the profits and losses or expenses that may be \r\n  incurred, such parties are partners.â€Â  Id. at 531-32, 50 S.E.2d at 580 \r\n  (emphasis added).Â  Where there is no express contract, either written or verbal, \r\n  common tests used in determining whether a partnership exists are:Â  (1) the \r\n  sharing of profits and losses; (2) community of interest in capital or property; \r\n  and (3) community of interest in control and management.Â  Halbersberg, \r\n  302 S.C. at 101, 394 S.E.2d at 10;Â  Stephens, 213 S.C. at 532, 50 S.E.2d \r\n  at 580. \r\nThe threshold question for the jury in this case \r\n  was whether the parties entered a contract whereby they intended to carry on \r\n  a business as principals and co-owners.Â  While it is not necessary there be \r\n  an express agreement between the parties to enter a partnership before such \r\n  a partnership can be found, there must be an intent of the parties to enter \r\n  into a contract that would, in the eyes of the law, constitute a partnership, \r\n  before such a finding can be made.Â  Thus, the law of contract was not wholly \r\n  irrelevant to the issues at hand.Â  Further, in looking at the various tests \r\n  applicable to the question of whether a partnership existed, a critical aspect \r\n  of the juryâ€™s determination in this case rested on whether the partiesâ€™ proposed \r\n  agreements as to compensation, ownership, and management were ever entered into \r\n  and finalized between and among the principals involved.Â  In light of this, \r\n  the contract formation elements of offer, acceptance, and consideration that \r\n  were included in the trial judgeâ€™s instructions to the jury were more likely \r\n  to help rather than hinder the juryâ€™s deliberations.Â  At any rate, we find, \r\n  when considered as a whole, the charges were reasonably free from error, and \r\n  any isolated portions which might have been misleading do not constitute reversible \r\n  error. \r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Sufficiency of Instruction in Response to Jury Question\r\nAppellant also takes exception to the \r\n  sufficiency of the trial judgeâ€™s response to a request for clarification the \r\n  jury submitted to the court during deliberations.Â  On this point, too, we find \r\n  no error.\r\nDuring deliberations, the jury requested \r\n  clarification of the elements that had to be shown to prove a partnership existed.Â  \r\n  In its initial instructions, the trial court charged the jury on the statutory \r\n  and common law rules and tests for determining the existence of a partnership.Â  \r\n  Specifically, the court charged S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-41-210 (Supp. 2003), defining \r\n  a partnership as an association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners \r\n  a business for profit, as well as S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-41-220 (1990), which provides \r\n  as follows:\r\n\r\nIn determining whether a partnership exists, these rules shall \r\n  apply:\r\n(1) Except as provided by Â§ 33-41-380 persons who are not \r\n  partners as to each other are not partners as to third persons;\r\n(2) Joint tenancy, tenancy in common, tenancy by the entireties, \r\n  joint property, common property or part ownership does not of itself establish \r\n  a partnership, whether such co-owners do or do not share any profit made by \r\n  the use of the property;\r\n(3) The sharing of gross returns does not of itself establish \r\n  a partnership, whether or not the persons sharing them have a joint or common \r\n  right or interest in any property from which the returns are derived; and\r\n(4) The receipt by a person of a share of the profits of a \r\n  business is prima facie evidence that he is a partner in the business, but no \r\n  such inference shall be drawn if such profits were received in payment\r\n  \r\n(a) as a debt by installments or otherwise,\r\n(b) as wages of an employee or rent to a landlord,\r\n(c) as an annuity to a widow or representative of a deceased \r\n  partner,\r\n(d) as interest on a loan, though the amount of payment vary \r\n  with the profits of the business or\r\n(e) as the consideration for the sale of the good will of \r\n  a business or other property by installments or otherwise.\r\n  \r\nThe court also charged under the common law as follows:\r\nIn South Carolina a partnership does not have to be in writing.Â  \r\n  A partnership may be formed by oral agreement and may even be implied to exist \r\n  by conduct of the parties without any evidence of expressed intent to form a \r\n  partnership.Â  The following tests are appropriate in determining whether a partnership \r\n  exists:Â  the sharing of profits and losses, community of interest in capital \r\n  or property, and community of interest in control or management.\r\n\r\nThe jury was apparently confused, however, as to \r\n  whether all of the elements under these tests had to be proven for a partnership \r\n  to exist, sending a note to the trial judge asking:Â  â€œRequirements/clarification \r\n  of the law re: existence of a partnership.Â  Do all the requirements have to \r\n  exist?â€Â  Unclear as to whether the jury was referring to the statutory rules \r\n  or common law tests, the trial judge asked them to elaborate.Â  The jury responded:Â  \r\n  â€œRequirements or elements that make a partnership; example, one, oral agreement; \r\n  two, actions of each party, etc.Â  Please give complete list and tell us how \r\n  many or all of these components exist.â€Â  Concerned that the jury was asking \r\n  the court to make a factual finding, it asked the jury foreman for further elaboration \r\n  when the jury returned to the courtroom.Â  The foreman responded:Â  â€œWhat I meant \r\n  was not for you to tell us which things exist, but how many are necessary to \r\n  exist in order to make it --.â€Â  Satisfied with the foremanâ€™s clarification, \r\n  the trial court recharged the jury with the substance of Â§Â§ 33-41-210 and 33-41-220, \r\n  as well as the common law as to the manner in which a partnership may be formed \r\n  and the common law tests, as initially charged by the court.Â  The court further \r\n  instructed:\r\n\r\nThese rules and the tests I stated \r\n  earlier are simply factors to be considered by you in determining whether or \r\n  not a partnership exists as I have defined partnership, which, again, is an \r\n  association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit.\r\n\r\nAppellant contends the trial courtâ€™s supplemental \r\n  instructions did not adequately answer the juryâ€™s question and the court erred \r\n  in failing to instruct the jury that no particular number of statutory factors \r\n  under Â§ 33-41-220 need be proven in order to permit the finding of a partnership.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  By admonishing the jury that the rules and tests described were \r\n  â€œsimply factors to be consideredâ€ by the jury in making its determination, we \r\n  find the juryâ€™s concern about applying one or all of the elements was adequately \r\n  addressed.Â  This instruction from the trial judge sufficiently advised the jury \r\n  that no particular number of statutory factors were necessary.Â  The general \r\n  instructions given by the court were sufficiently broad to enable the jury to \r\n  understand the law and the issues involved.Â  Accordingly, we find no error with \r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s response to the juryâ€™s question.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Entitlement to New Trial Based on the Evidence\r\nFinally, Appellant argues the record contains no \r\n  evidence to reasonably support the juryâ€™s findings. She therefore asserts she \r\n  is entitled to a new trial.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried \r\n  by a jury, the appellate court will correct errors of law, but will not disturb \r\n  a factual finding of the jury unless a review of the record discloses no evidence \r\n  to reasonably support the juryâ€™s findings.Â  York v. Conway Ford, Inc., \r\n  325 S.C. 170, 174, 480 S.E.2d 726, 728 (1997).Â  This court has no power to review \r\n  matters of fact in an action at law, except to determine if a verdict is wholly \r\n  unsupported by the evidence.Â  Id.\r\nSouth Carolinaâ€™s Uniform Partnership Act defines \r\n  a â€œpartnershipâ€ as â€œan association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners \r\n  a business for profit. . . .â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-41-210 (Supp. 2003).Â  In applying \r\n  this definition, our courts have held:Â  â€œThe following tests are appropriate \r\n  in determining whether a partnership exists:Â  (1) the sharing of profits and \r\n  losses; (2) community of interest in capital or property; and (3) community \r\n  of interest in control and management.â€Â  Halbersberg v. Berry, 302 S.C. \r\n  97, 101, 394 S.E.2d 7, 10 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  In the present case, we find the \r\n  evidence regarding the intended ownership structure, treatment of profits and \r\n  losses, and control and management over the ventures was sufficient for the \r\n  jury to reasonably conclude a partnership did not exist.\r\nSpecifically, there is evidence from which the \r\n  jury could conclude that Post was not a â€œco-ownerâ€ in the venture and did not \r\n  hold any â€œcommunity of interestâ€ in the capital or property at issue.Â  As noted \r\n  above, Kisteneff testified that when he proposed that he and Post enter into \r\n  a partnership, Post expressly declined, citing his inability to hold an ownership \r\n  interest in any new venture due to the personal liens and judgments that had \r\n  been entered against him.Â  Moreover, it is undisputed that Post never invested \r\n  any capital toward the real estate projects in question.\r\nFurther, there is evidence from which the jury \r\n  could determine Post did not hold any â€œcommunity of interest in control and \r\n  managementâ€ of the projects.Â  The WAGA letter, which Kisteneff testified they \r\n  all agreed laid the foundation to their relationship, clearly contemplated an \r\n  association whereby Post would be an agent of the partnership between Kisteneff \r\n  and Canney, but would not, himself, be a partner.Â  Kisteneff also testified \r\n  to instances where he â€œauthorizedâ€ Post to begin work on a project or to execute \r\n  a contract on behalf of KCI, thereby evincing Kisteneffâ€™s control and management \r\n  over the projects.Â  Kisteneff further maintained, because he was the only one \r\n  investing money and was the only one at risk in the ventures, he had â€œsole controlâ€ \r\n  over the projects. \r\nFinally, the jury could reasonably find that a \r\n  partnership was not implied from the sharing of profits and losses.Â  When examining \r\n  profit-sharing arrangements for the purpose of determining the existence of \r\n  a partnership, the Act provides that:\r\n\r\nThe receipt by a person of a \r\n  share of the profits of a business is prima facie evidence that he is a partner \r\n  in the business, but no such inference shall be drawn if such profits were received \r\n  in payment\r\n(a) as a debt by installments \r\n  or otherwise,\r\n(b) as wages of an employee or \r\n  rent to a landlord,\r\n(c) as an annuity to a widow \r\n  or representative of a deceased partner,\r\n(d) as interest on a loan, though \r\n  the amount of payment vary with the profits of the business or\r\n(e) as the consideration for \r\n  the sale of the good will of a business or other property by installments or \r\n  otherwise.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-41-220(4) (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\nAlthough there is evidence KCI advanced \r\n  Post a total of $75,000 against his future share of profits in the Boston project, \r\n  it is undisputed that no profits were ever actually realized from this project \r\n  or any other.Â  The testimony from Kisteneff shows their agreement was that Post \r\n  was to share in the profits if and only if the projects were successful enough \r\n  to produce profits.Â  Thus, Post did not actually receive â€œa share of the profits,â€ \r\n  but only an advance toward the monies the parties contemplated he would realize \r\n  from his association in the ventures.Â  As discussed above, there was substantial \r\n  evidence that Kisteneff and Canney intended to structure their relationship \r\n  with Post so that Post would be employed as an agent, and the distribution of \r\n  any profits to him would be classified as compensation, or wages, for work performed \r\n  on the venture.Â  Accordingly, there is evidence from which the jury could have \r\n  determined, pursuant to Â§ 33-41-220(4)(b), no inference should be drawn as to \r\n  a partnership based on the $75,000 advance.Â  Finally, one of the appropriate \r\n  tests in determining the existence of a partnership is not simply consideration \r\n  of the sharing of profits, but also the sharing of losses.Â  The evidence here \r\n  shows no attendant sharing in losses by Post.\r\nFor these reasons, we find sufficient evidence \r\n  of record to reasonably support the juryâ€™s finding that no partnership existed.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we find \r\n  no error with the trial judgeâ€™s instructions to the jury.Â  We further find the \r\n  evidence adduced at trial reasonably supports the juryâ€™s verdict, and appellant \r\n  is therefore not entitled to a new trial.Â  The ruling of the trial court is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, STILWELL, and CURETON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Ultimately, \r\n    Alexis Pierre Kisteneff was added as a plaintiff andBara Post, individually \r\n    and as the personal representative of her late husband, Malcolm Post, was \r\n    substituted as defendant after Malcolmâ€™s death. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-148","title":"Lawson v.

Sullivan and Katherine Carruth Link, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAndrew M. Jones, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Augusta Lawson appeals from \r\n  an order decreeing that a certain structure is a modular home and not a trailer. \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTSÂ Â Â Â  \r\nKaren Irby bought a lot in the Green Acres subdivision \r\n  in 1999. That lot was subject to certain covenants and restrictions, one of \r\n  which stated â€œ[n]o structure of a temporary character (trailer, basement, tent, \r\n  shack, garage, barn, or other out-building) shall be used on any lot at any \r\n  time as a residence, either temporarily or permanently.â€ In 2001, Irby attempted \r\n  to move a structure onto her lot. The structure was â€œhauled into the Subdivision \r\n  in two pieces on transport trailers.â€ Augusta Lawson, a homeowner in the same \r\n  subdivision, obtained a temporary restraining order against Irby. About a week \r\n  later, Lawson moved for a temporary injunction. The court granted the motion, \r\n  enjoining Irby from â€œplacing, constructing, and/or erectingâ€ her structure on \r\n  her lot. Following a non-jury trial, the court found â€œas a matter of law, that \r\n  [Irbyâ€™s] house is a modular home and that it is not temporary in nature.â€ The \r\n  trial court vacated its previous order and denied Lawsonâ€™s motion for a permanent \r\n  injunction. \r\nÂ ISSUES \r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the trial court err in finding \r\n  that the structure was not temporary and therefore not prohibited by the covenants? \r\n(2) Did the trial court err in admitting some of \r\n  Irbyâ€™s exhibits?\r\n(3) Did the trial court err in finding certain \r\n  facts?\r\n\r\nANALYSISÂ Â  \r\nâ€œA suit seeking an injunction to enforce restrictive \r\n  covenants is an action in equity.â€ Arnoti v. Lukie, 350 S.C. 177, 179, \r\n  564 S.E.2d 691, 692 (Ct. App. 2002). Therefore, â€œthis Court may take its own \r\n  view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€ Id.\r\nLawson argues that the structure is a trailer because \r\n  it was carried to the subdivision in two parts, joinable in the middle; it can \r\n  easily be separated and moved again; and it looks like a trailer. Lawson also \r\n  points to Irbyâ€™s purchase agreement that lists the structure as a â€œMobile/Manufactured \r\n  Homeâ€ and cites the UCC as the law governing the transaction. \r\n  [1]  For her part, Irby admits that her home was moved in two pieces and \r\n  has vinyl siding, but contends that such is not prohibited by Green Acresâ€™ covenants. \r\n  Irby points to two houses in the subdivision that were moved there after being \r\n  erected elsewhere. More importantly, Irby testified that the State of South \r\n  Carolina had certified her home as modular.  \r\n  [2]   \r\nThe South Carolina Modular Buildings Construction \r\n  Act provides, in part\r\n\r\nModular building units bearing evidence of approval \r\n  must be acceptable in all localities as meeting the requirements of this chapter \r\n  and must be considered and accepted equivalent to a site-built structure as \r\n  meeting the requirements of safety to life, health, and property imposed by \r\n  any ordinance of any local government if the units are erected or installed \r\n  in accordance with all conditions of the approval.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-43-130 (Supp. 2001).\r\nThe Act has been interpreted to define \r\n  a modular home. See Henry v. Chambron, 304 S.C. 351, 352, 404 \r\n  S.E.2d 518, 519 (Ct. App. 1991) (ruling that a modular home is one â€œbuilt off \r\n  site â€¦ transported to its intended location in as many as twenty sections â€¦ \r\n  affixed permanently to the propertyâ€ that has been certified by the South Carolina \r\n  Building Code Council as a modular home). In contrast, a mobile home â€œdoes not \r\n  undergo the same certification process as a modular home and it need not comply \r\n  with the standard building code applicable to site built homes. Furthermore, \r\n  there is no requirement that a mobile home be permanently affixed to the property.â€ \r\n  Id. at 353, 404 S.E.2d 519.\r\nGreen Acresâ€™ restrictions prohibit the \r\n  use of any â€œstructure of temporary character (trailer, basement, tent, \r\n  shack, garage, barn, or other out-building,)â€ but they do not prohibit the use \r\n  of modular homes. Lawsonâ€™s expert witness admitted that â€œ[b]ased on the Stateâ€™s \r\n  criteria for what a modular home is, [Irbyâ€™s house] would be a modular home.â€ \r\n  Based on that testimony and other evidence, the trial court found that Irbyâ€™s \r\n  home was not a trailer, but a modular home and was therefore permissible. That \r\n  conclusion is well supported by the record. See Taylor v. Lindsey, \r\n  322 S.C. 1, 4, 498 S.E.2d 862, 863 (1998) (explaining that words used in restrictive \r\n  covenants are to be given their â€œcommon, ordinary meaningâ€ and that â€œrestrictions \r\n  as to the use of real estate should be strictly construed and all doubts resolved \r\n  in favor of free use of the propertyâ€). We therefore decline to find otherwise.\r\nThe trial courtâ€™s order is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHuff, Stilwell, and Beatty, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  It is unclear that Lawson presented that argument \r\n    at trial, though she introduced the document itself into evidence.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Irbyâ€™s counsel tried to introduce an â€œinspectorâ€™s \r\n    certificateâ€ while cross-examining Lawsonâ€™s expert witness, but Lawson objected \r\n    to the introduction of the document and the trial court sustained the objection. \r\n    Counsel then showed â€œa documentâ€ to Irby while she was on direct examination \r\n    purported to be a state certificate from her home, showing that the home was \r\n    modular. That document was not introduced into evidence. Lawson did not object \r\n    to the testimony, however.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-149","title":"Hook v.

Bishop (the â€œBishopsâ€) seeking \r\n  enforcement of a restrictive covenant.Â  The master-in-equity issued a mandatory \r\n  injunction requiring the Bishops to remove all structures within the twenty-foot \r\n  side setback adjacent to Hookâ€™s property.Â  The Bishops appeal, claiming: 1) \r\n  Hook failed to prove she had the right to enforce the restrictive covenants; \r\n  2) the assignment to Hook of the right to enforce the restrictive covenants \r\n  was not valid; 3) the restrictive covenants are ambiguous and unenforceable; \r\n  4) the suit to enjoin construction was not timely commenced; 5) the court failed \r\n  to properly balance the equities between the parties; and 6) the award of attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees and costs was improper.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nSpence Plantation is a residential subdivision \r\n  developed by RPW Development and its president, Robert P. Wilkins, Jr., (collectively, \r\n  â€œDeveloperâ€).Â  Each lot within the subdivision is subject to detailed and extensive \r\n  covenants as set forth in every deed.Â  The covenants require approval by Developer \r\n  and the Architectural Review Committee (â€œARCâ€) of all building and landscaping \r\n  plans prior to construction.Â  To insure compliance, the covenants reserve to \r\n  â€œGrantor or Grantorâ€™s nomineeâ€ authority to enforce the restrictive covenants. \r\n  [1] Â  Wilkins is named in each deed as Grantorâ€™s nominee.Â  \r\nIn anticipation of building their home, the Bishops \r\n  submitted building and landscaping plans to Developer and ARC.Â  Although the \r\n  plans were approved, the Bishops began to erect a retaining wall that was not \r\n  included on the submitted plans. [2] \r\n  Â  When Hook, the adjoining landowner, discovered the retaining wall, she \r\n  immediately contacted the Bishops to protest the construction.Â  However, the \r\n  Bishops continued to build the wall and also began construction of a swimming \r\n  pool without submitting plans to Developer or ARC for approval. [3] Â  \r\nAs a result, Hook initiated this action seeking \r\n  an injunction to stop further construction within the twenty-foot side setback \r\n  line adjacent to her property and requesting removal of all structures within \r\n  this area.Â  A temporary restraining order halted construction on the wall and \r\n  pool on April 20, 2001.Â  \r\nAt trial, the master-in-equity issued a mandatory \r\n  injunction, ordering the Bishops to remove all structures within the twenty-foot \r\n  side setback line of Hookâ€™s property, restore the land to its natural condition, \r\n  and conduct all further construction in accordance with plans approved by Developer \r\n  and ARC.Â  The master further awarded Hook $10,071.14 in attorneyâ€™s fees and \r\n  costs.Â  \r\nOn appeal, the Bishops argue Hook did not have \r\n  the right to enforce the covenants because the document purporting to assign \r\n  this right to Hook was never introduced or admitted into evidence.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  they claim this right can not be assigned to Hook because the covenants designate \r\n  the succession of individuals that may act as Grantorâ€™s nominee.Â  The Bishops \r\n  also contend: 1) the restrictive covenants are ambiguous, and thus, unenforceable; \r\n  2) suit was not timely commenced because the wall was completed before an action \r\n  to enjoin them was initiated; 3) in balancing the equities between the parties, \r\n  the harm caused by having to move the retaining wall outweighs any damage suffered \r\n  by Hook as a result of the wall; and 4) the award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs \r\n  was improper.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Assignment of the Right to Enforce the Restrictive Covenants\r\nRestrictive covenants are imposed as \r\n  a voluntary contract between parties. Houck v. Rivers, 316 S.C. 414, 416, 450 S.E.2d 106, 108, (Ct. \r\n  App. 1994); see also Seabrook Island Prop. Owners Assâ€™n v. Pelzer, \r\n  292 S.C. 343, 347, 356 S.E.2d 411, 414 (Ct. App. 1987) (â€œRestrictive covenants \r\n  are contractual in nature and bind the parties thereto in the same manner as \r\n  any other contract.â€).Â  The rules applicable to the construction of contracts \r\n  are applicable to the construction of restrictive covenants contained in deeds.Â  \r\n  Houck, 316 S.C. at 416, 450 S.E.2d at 108.Â  \r\nAn action to interpret a contract is \r\n  an action at law.Â  Pruitt v. South Carolina Med. Malpractice Liab. Joint \r\n  Underwriting Assâ€™n, 343 S.C. 335, 339, 540 S.E.2d 843, 845 (2001) (â€œAn action \r\n  to construe a contract is an action at law reviewable under an any evidence \r\n  standard.â€).Â  â€œIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, \r\n  our scope of review extends merely to the correction of errors of law; factual \r\n  findings of the trial judge will not be disturbed on appeal unless a review \r\n  of the record discloses that there is no evidence which reasonably supports \r\n  the judgeâ€™s findings.â€Â  Crary v. Djebelli, 329 S.C. 385, 388, 496 S.E.2d \r\n  21, 23 (1998).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Proof of Assignment\r\nThe Bishops argue the master erred by \r\n  finding Hook was assigned the right to act as grantorâ€™s nominee.Â  Specifically, \r\n  the Bishops argue the document purporting to assign the right to enforce the \r\n  covenants was never introduced or admitted into evidence.Â  Thus, they claim \r\n  Hook failed to prove the assignment.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œJudicial notice is a substitute for formal \r\n  proof of a matter by evidence.â€Â  29 Am. Jur. 2d Evidence Â§ 24 (2003).Â  \r\n  Judicial notice is the means by which the court will admit into evidence and \r\n  consider, without proof, â€œmatters of common and general knowledge or those that \r\n  are easily capable of immediate verification.â€Â  Id.Â  The effect of judicial \r\n  notice of an adjudicative fact is to conclusively establish the fact.Â  Moss \r\n  v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 267 S.C. 370, 377, 228 S.E.2d 108, 112 (1976). \r\nThe restrictive covenants of Spence Plantation \r\n  allow â€œGrantor or Grantorâ€™s nomineeâ€ to enjoin or take other legal steps to \r\n  prevent a violation of the restrictive covenants.Â  By document dated April 20, \r\n  2001, signed by Wilkins as Grantorâ€™s nominee, Hook was assigned the right to \r\n  enforce the restrictive covenants pertaining to this litigation.Â  This document \r\n  was filed with Hookâ€™s initial pleadings, and Wilkinsâ€™ trial testimony confirmed \r\n  the intent to make this assignment. \r\nThe record indicates the master took judicial \r\n  notice of the assignment document, without objection.Â  As judicial notice of \r\n  the document was not objected to at trial, this issue is not preserved for appellate \r\n  review. Â See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d \r\n  731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first \r\n  time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge \r\n  to be preserved for appellate review.â€).Â  By taking judicial notice of the executed \r\n  assignment document, the existence and content of the document was established \r\n  as a fact.\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Validity of Assignment\r\nThe Bishops argue the master erred by \r\n  finding the assignment to Hook was valid because the covenants designate the \r\n  succession of individuals that may act as Grantorâ€™s nominee, and whose authority \r\n  must be revoked prior to designating another individual to act as nominee.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œWords of a restrictive covenant will \r\n  be given the common, ordinary meaning attributed to them at the time of their \r\n  execution.â€Â  Taylor v. Lindsey, 332 S.C. 1, 4, 498 S.E.2d 862, 863 (1998).Â  \r\n  However, â€œ[g]reater regard should be given to the intention of the parties, \r\n  as ascertained from the language used and the surrounding circumstances, than \r\n  to the exact words used in attempting to express that intention.â€Â  Richard R. \r\n  Powell, Powell on Real Property Â§60.05 at 60-75 (2000); see also \r\n  Palmetto Dunes Resort v. Brown, 287 S.C. 1, 6, 336 S.E.2d 15, 18 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1985) (holding because restrictive covenants are contractual in nature, \r\n  the paramount rule of construction, to ascertain and give effect to the intent \r\n  of the parties as determined from the whole document, is applied to restrictive \r\n  covenants).Â  \r\nThe restrictive covenants provide:\r\n\r\nGrantor hereby names Robert P. Wilkins, Jr. as Grantorâ€™s \r\n  nominee.Â  If for any reason he is unable or unwilling to serve, the following \r\n  are named as substitutes in the order named:Â  Robert P. Wilkins, Anne Wilkins \r\n  Brooks, Rose T. Wilkins, and Sarah W. Weiss.Â  Grantor further reserves the right \r\n  to revoke its designation and to name some other person or persons in writing. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe covenants delineate the order of \r\n  substitutes to serve as Grantorâ€™s nominee in the event Wilkins â€œis unable \r\n  or unwilling to serve.â€Â  However, Wilkins has never been â€œunable or unwilling \r\n  to serveâ€ as Grantorâ€™s nominee, nor does a partial assignment of his right to \r\n  enforce the covenants make him â€œunable or unwilling to serve.â€Â  See Oâ€™Shea \r\n  v. Lesser, 308 S.C. 10, 15, 416 S.E.2d 629, 632 (1992) (holding the right \r\n  to enforce a restrictive covenant is not fiduciary and may be assigned to another).Â  \r\n\r\nAs Wilkins has continuously acted as \r\n  Grantorâ€™s nominee and has never been â€œunable or unwilling to serve,â€ the covenant \r\n  delineating the order of succession to serve as Grantorâ€™s nominee is not applicable.Â  \r\n  Thus, the evidence within the record supports the masterâ€™s finding the assignment \r\n  to Hook was valid. [4] \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Enforceability of the Restrictive Covenants\r\nThe Bishops argue the master erred by failing to \r\n  find the restrictive covenants ambiguous.Â  Specifically, they contend the Minimum \r\n  Architectural Standards read with the covenants create ambiguity between the \r\n  documents causing the covenants to be unenforceable.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe rules applicable to the construction \r\n  of contracts are applicable to the construction of restrictive covenants contained \r\n  in deeds.Â  Houck, 316 S.C. at 416, 450 S.E.2d at 108.Â  â€œAn action to \r\n  construe a contract is an action at law reviewable under an any evidence standard.â€Â  \r\n  Pruitt, 343 S.C. at 339, 540 S.E.2d at 845.Â  Restrictions on the free \r\n  use of land are not favored in the law and any ambiguity within a covenant should \r\n  be construed strictly against the grantor and persons seeking to enforce it.Â  \r\n  Hamilton v. CCM, Inc., 274 S.C. 152, 158, 263 S.E.2d 378, 381 (1980); \r\n  Taylor, 332 S.C. at 4, 498 S.E.2d at 864.Â  Conversely, this rule of strict \r\n  construction will not be used to defeat the clear and express language of a \r\n  restrictive covenant.Â  Sea Pines Plantation Co. v. Wells, 294 S.C. 266, \r\n  270, 363 S.E.2d 891, 894 (1987).\r\nThe Bishops contend the covenants are ambiguous \r\n  because they require a twenty-foot side setback for â€œbuildings, other structure[s] \r\n  or any improvement[s],â€ while the Minimum Architectural Standards provide fences \r\n  â€œmay run along the property lines.â€Â  The Bishops argue because the terms â€œbuilding,â€ \r\n  â€œstructure,â€ â€œimprovement,â€ â€œfence,â€ and â€œwallâ€ are not defined or differentiated \r\n  from one another, the documents are ambiguous and thus unenforceable.Â  \r\nThe restrictive covenants provide, â€œ[n]o \r\n  building, or other structure or any improvement shall be located on said lot \r\n  within twenty (20') feet of the front line, within Twenty (20') feet of the \r\n  side lines, and within Fifty (50') feet of the rear line.â€Â  Providing additional \r\n  guidance, the Minimum Architectural Standards state, â€œ[f]ence[s] must start \r\n  at the back corners of the house and may run along the property lines.Â  Brick, \r\n  wrought iron, stucco and wooden fences (with approval) are allowed. . \r\n  . . [f]ence will be no higher than 5 feet.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  \r\nAlthough we do not see any ambiguity in these \r\n  two documents, the first restrictive covenant, as contained in every deed in \r\n  Spence Plantation, mandates:\r\n\r\nNO BUILDING, FENCE, . . . OR ANY OTHER STRUCTURE OF ANY \r\n  KIND SHALL BE BEGUN, ERECTED OR PLACED ON THE LOT UNTIL THE BUILDING PLANS, \r\n  SPECIFICATIONS, DESIGN AND PLOT PLAN SHOWING THE LOCATION OF SUCH BUILDING, \r\n  FENCE, . . . OR STRUCTURE ON THE LOT IN QUESTION HAVE FIRST BEEN APPROVED BY \r\n  GRANTOR OR GRANTORâ€™S NOMINEE . . . .\r\n\r\n(emphasis in original).\r\nIn submitting building and landscaping plans, the \r\n  Bishops did not depict any structure within the twenty-foot side setback area.Â  \r\n  Subsequently, they constructed a retaining wall and a swimming pool within this \r\n  area.Â  Even if the retaining wall constituted a fence, the Bishops failed to \r\n  comply with the covenant requiring owners to obtain approval prior to construction.Â  \r\n  Moreover, the covenants prohibit any fence to exceed five feet in height.Â  The \r\n  Bishopsâ€™ wall ranges in height from 6.7 feet to 11.7 feet, clearly outside of \r\n  the permissible limits.Â  \r\nAs the Bishops failed to obtain approval prior \r\n  to building, and the structure exceeds all permissible limits for construction \r\n  of a fence, ample evidence exists within the record to support the masterâ€™s \r\n  finding that this structure violates the restrictive covenants.Â  Thus, the master \r\n  did not err by enforcing the covenants and ordering removal of the wall and \r\n  all structures within the twenty-foot side setback adjacent to Hookâ€™s property.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Failure to Timely Commence Suit\r\nThe Bishops argue the master erred by finding suit \r\n  was timely commenced because they completed the wall before an action to enjoin \r\n  them was initiated.Â  Thus, they contend their wall should be deemed conforming.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA suit seeking an injunction to enforce restrictive \r\n  covenants is an action in equity.â€Â  Arnoti v. Lukie, 350 S.C. 177, 179, \r\n  564 S.E.2d 691, 692 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Although equitable remedies are ordinarily \r\n  left to the sound discretion of the trial court, on appeal of an equitable action \r\n  tried by the master alone, an appellate court may find facts in accordance with \r\n  its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Id.; County of \r\n  Richland v. Simpkins, 348 S.C. 664, 668, 560 S.E.2d 902, 904 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nThe restrictive covenant at issue provides:\r\n\r\nIn the event the Grantor, or his nominee shall fail to approve \r\n  or disapprove within thirty (30) days after plans and specifications have been \r\n  submitted to the Grantor, or in any event, if no suit to enjoin the construction \r\n  has been commenced prior to the completion thereof, approval will not be required \r\n  and the related covenants shall be deemed to have been fully complied with.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nIt is undisputed Hook immediately objected upon \r\n  learning of the wall, and attempts were made between the parties and Developer \r\n  to reach an amicable solution.Â  However, during these negotiations and while \r\n  on notice of Hookâ€™s objections, the Bishops continued to build the wall.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  by Mr. Bishopâ€™s own testimony, the wall was not yet complete at the time of \r\n  trial.Â  Bishop testified his plans include installing thirty-two-inch-high wrought-iron \r\n  brackets between the nine pillars capping the wall and topping the pillars with \r\n  one-foot tall brass lanterns.Â  \r\nAs the evidence in the record indicates the wall \r\n  was not yet complete at the time of trial, the master did not err by finding \r\n  suit was timely commenced.\r\nIV.Â Â Â  Balancing of Equities\r\nThe Bishops argue the master erred by failing to \r\n  properly balance the equities between the parties.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA court does not automatically issue a mandatory \r\n  injunction once it finds a restrictive covenant has been violated.Â  The court \r\n  must balance the equities between the parties; and if the harm to the defendant \r\n  outweighs the plaintiffâ€™s benefit, no relief will be granted.â€Â  Sea Pines, \r\n  294 S.C. at 274, 363 S.E.2d at&nbsp;896 (citing Hunnicutt v. Rickenbaker, \r\n  268 S.C. 511, 515-516, 234 S.E.2d 887, 889 (1977)).Â  Although the issuance of \r\n  a mandatory injunction requires a balancing of the equities between the parties, \r\n  the decision of whether to issue such relief rests in the courtâ€™s sound discretion.Â  \r\n  Sea Pines, 294 S.C. at 274, 363 S.E.2d at 896.\r\nHowever, injunctions are routinely granted even \r\n  though the injunctive remedy may cause economic hardship to the defendant.Â  \r\n  Sea Pines, 294 S.C. at 275, 363 S.E.2d at 896.Â  Furthermore, â€œa restrictive \r\n  covenant will be enforced irrespective of the amount of damage which will result \r\n  from the breach, and even though there is no substantial monetary damage to \r\n  the complainant by reason of the violation.Â  The amount of damages and even \r\n  the fact that the Plaintiff has sustained no pecuniary damages are totally immaterial.â€Â  \r\n  Houck, 316 S.C. at 419, 450 S.E.2d at 109.Â  A court of equity will issue \r\n  an injunction when it is necessary to prevent an individual from violating the \r\n  equitable rights of another where he has notice, actual or constructive, of \r\n  such rights.Â  Sprouse v. Winston, 212 S.C. 176, 185, 46 S.E.2d 874, 878 \r\n  (1948).Â  \r\nThe evidence presented at trial shows the removal \r\n  cost of the retaining wall would be $20,000.00, while the cost to rebuild the \r\n  wall outside of the twenty-foot side setback area would be between $60,000.00 \r\n  and $80,000.00.Â  The Bishops also assert the removal of the wall would diminish \r\n  their ability to use the existing garage.Â  However, the master found this expense \r\n  is incurred solely by the Bishopsâ€™ actions in willfully proceeding to build \r\n  the wall while on notice of Hookâ€™s objections.Â  \r\nIn contrast to the harm caused by having to move \r\n  the retaining wall, the Bishops argue Hook has suffered no damage as a result \r\n  of the wall.Â  However, the master found Hookâ€™s property had substantially \r\n  diminished in value due to the breach of the covenants by the Bishops.Â  Without \r\n  issuance of an injunction, this harm would be irreparable.Â  Thus, the only remedy \r\n  available to restore Hook to the position she was in prior to the violation \r\n  is an injunction.Â  Â Â \r\nFurthermore, upon review of the record, it appears \r\n  the master, in balancing the equities, weighed heavily that Bishop proceeded \r\n  to build while on notice of Hookâ€™s objections.Â  The record clearly supports \r\n  the masterâ€™s finding that equity favors Hook, and thus, the master did not abuse \r\n  his discretion by issuing the mandatory injunction.Â  See Arnoti, \r\n  350 S.C. at 183, 564 S.E.2d at 694 (â€œ[W]hile removal . . . will result in a \r\n  hardship to the [plaintiffs], it was caused by [their] own actions in knowingly \r\n  failing to either comply with the restrictions of the subdivision or seek, through \r\n  proper means, an amendment of the restrictions.â€ ).\r\n  V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAttorneyâ€™s Fees \r\n   \r\nThe Bishops argue the master erred by allowing \r\n  Hook to recover attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  We disagree.\r\nIt is well settled in South Carolina \r\n  that attorneyâ€™s fees are recoverable only when authorized by contract or statute.Â  \r\n  Baron Data Systems, Inc., v. Loter, 297 S.C. 382, 383, 377 S.E.2d 296, \r\n  297 (1989).Â  â€œWhere there is a contract, the award of attorneyâ€™s fees is left \r\n  to the discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed on appeal unless \r\n  an abuse of discretion is shown.â€Â  Baron Data Systems, 297 S.C. at 384, \r\n  377 S.E.2d at 297; see also Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, \r\n  365, 384 S.E.2d 741, 748, (1989) (â€œAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs is \r\n  a discretionary matter not to be overturned absent abuse by the trial court.â€)\r\nThe restrictive covenants allow Grantorâ€™s \r\n  nominee to collect reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees and all other expenses incurred \r\n  by the nominee in any legal action.Â  The master found Wilkins effectively assigned \r\n  Hook his rights to enforce the covenants against the Bishops.Â  As the assignment \r\n  transfers â€œall rights, power, and authority to enforce this particular covenant,â€ \r\n  the right to recover fees and costs was also transferred.Â  Thus, the master \r\n  did not abuse his discretion in awarding Hook attorneyâ€™s fees and costs as incurred \r\n  in this action.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nÂ For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the \r\n  master is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HOWARD, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concurring.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  â€œGrantorâ€ is Spence Plantation Phase III Limited Partnership, of \r\n    which RPW Development is the general managing partner.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  At present, the wall ranges in height from 6.7 feet to 11.7 feet, \r\n    and is 104 feet long.Â  It sits approximately eleven feet from Hookâ€™s property \r\n    line.Â  Although, the majority of the wall runs parallel to Hookâ€™s property \r\n    line, an additional segment of the wall extends perpendicularly from the side \r\n    of the Bishopsâ€™ house to within six inches of Hookâ€™s property line.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  The pool is located approximately ten feet from \r\n    Hookâ€™s property line. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  The master found the assignment was made by Wilkins, as both general \r\n    managing partner of the Grantor and as Grantorâ€™s nominee.Â  Pursuant to this \r\n    covenant, the right to designate other individuals to serve as nominees to \r\n    enforce the restrictive covenants is reserved by the Grantor.Â  Therefore, \r\n    the assignment was valid as made by Wilkins in his capacity as the general \r\n    managing partner of the Grantor.Â  Furthermore, the master finds the right \r\n    to enforce the covenants is also assignable by Wilkins as Grantorâ€™s nominee, \r\n    and that Wilkins, in his capacity as Grantorâ€™s nominee, effectively made a \r\n    partial assignment of his right to enforce the covenants.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-150","title":"State v.

Brown, Jr., Family Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-153\r\nSubmitted November 3, 2003 â€“ Filed March \r\n  9, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nWalter B. Todd and J. Derrick Jackson, both of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nGene Trotter, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â In this domestic action, \r\n  David Thomas Walters (â€œHusbandâ€) sued Margaret Smith Walters (â€œWifeâ€) for divorce \r\n  and equitable distribution of marital property.Â  The family court granted the \r\n  divorce, divided the marital property, and awarded Wife alimony and attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees.Â  Husband appeals, arguing the alimony award was excessive, the classification \r\n  of certain personal property as non-marital was erroneous, the modification \r\n  of the property distribution was made sua sponte, and the award of attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees to Wife was improper.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nHusband and Wife were married in July 1976.Â  They \r\n  have two children, an emancipated son and a daughter in her final year of college.Â  \r\n\r\nIn July 2000, Husband filed an action for divorce \r\n  and equitable distribution of marital property.Â  The court issued a temporary \r\n  order, requiring Husband to pay alimony to Wife.Â  In March 2001, Husband was \r\n  held in contempt of the courtâ€™s order requiring payment of temporary alimony \r\n  to Wife.Â  \r\nIn March 2002, the family court issued a divorce \r\n  decree imputing $150,000 annual income to Husband, ordering Husband to pay $3,000 \r\n  per month permanent periodic alimony and $10,000 of Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees, \r\n  and dividing the marital estate.Â  Both Husband and Wife filed timely motions \r\n  to reconsider pursuant to Rule 59(e), South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  \r\n  The family court denied Husbandâ€™s request for re-hearing on the issues of imputed \r\n  income, alimony, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  However, the family court altered the \r\n  distribution of property to award Wife a linen press initially granted to Husband. [1] Â  Husband appeals.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œ[A]n appellate court reviewing a family court \r\n  order may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of \r\n  the evidence.â€Â  Sharps v. Sharps, 342 S.C. 71, 79, 535 S.E.2d 913, 917 \r\n  (2000).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require an appellate court \r\n  to disregard the findings of the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses \r\n  and was in a better position to evaluate credibility and assign comparative \r\n  weight to the testimony.Â  Greene v. Greene, 351 S.C. 329, 335, 569 S.E.2d \r\n  393, 397 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œ[W]hen an appellate court chooses to find facts \r\n  in accordance with its own view of the evidence, the court must state distinctly \r\n  its findings of fact and the reason for its decision.â€Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, \r\n  351 S.C. 278, 283, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Alimony\r\nHusband argues the family courtâ€™s \r\n  award to Wife of $3,000 per month permanent periodic alimony was excessive because: \r\n  1) the court improperly imputed income to Husband; 2) it was based on Wifeâ€™s \r\n  inflated expenses; 3) it was based on a lifestyle neither party could afford; \r\n  and 4) it serves as a disincentive for Wife to improve her employment.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œAn award of alimony rests within the sound discretion \r\n  of the family court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  \r\n  Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 183-84, 554 S.E.2d 421, 424&nbsp;(Ct. App. \r\n  2001).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the court is controlled by some \r\n  error of law or where the order, based upon factual findings, is without evidentiary \r\n  support.â€Â  Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, 485, 477 S.E.2d 727, 729 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1996).Â  \r\nAlimony is a substitute for the support which is \r\n  normally incident to the marital relationship.Â  Nienow v. Nienow, 268 \r\n  S.C. 161, 171, 232 S.E.2d 504, 510 (1977).Â  â€œOrdinarily, the purpose of alimony \r\n  is to place the supported spouse, as nearly as practical, in the position of \r\n  support . . . enjoyed during the marriage.â€Â  Johnson v. JohnsonÂ­, 296 \r\n  S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  However, alimony should \r\n  not serve as a disincentive for a spouse to improve his or her employment potential \r\n  or to dissuade the spouse from providing, to the extent possible, for his or \r\n  her own support.Â  Id. at 303, 372 S.E.2d at 115.Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn determining an alimony award, the family court must consider the following \r\n  factors: (1) duration of the marriage; (2) physical and emotional health of \r\n  the parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4) employment history \r\n  and earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living established during \r\n  the marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the parties; \r\n  (7) current and reasonably anticipated expenses of the parties; (8) equitable \r\n  apportionment; (9) custody of children; (10) marital misconduct or fault; (11) \r\n  tax consequences; (12) prior support obligations; and (13) any other factors \r\n  the court considers relevant.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2002).Â  No \r\n  one factor is considered dispositive.Â  Lide v. Lide, 277 S.C. 155, 157, \r\n  283 S.E.2d 832, 833 (1981).Â  \r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Imputed Income\r\nHusband argues the family court erred by imputing \r\n  $150,000 annual income to him.Â  We disagree.\r\nCourts â€œwill closely scrutinize the facts of any \r\n  case wherein aÂ Â Â  husband . . . voluntarily changes employment so as to lessen \r\n  his earning capacity and, in turn, his ability to pay alimony . . . .â€Â  Camp \r\n  v. Camp, 269 S.C. 173, 174, 236 S.E.2d 814, 815 (1977).Â  â€œ[I]f the obligor \r\n  spouse has the ability to earn more income than he is in fact earning, the court \r\n  may impute income according to what he could earn by using his or her best efforts \r\n  to gain employment equal to his capabilities, and an award of alimony based \r\n  on such imputation may be a proper exercise of discretion even if it exhausts \r\n  the obligor spouseâ€™s actual income.â€Â  \r\nDixon v. Dixon, 334 S.C. 222, 240, 512 S.E.2d 539,&nbsp;548 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1999). When considering actual income versus earning capacity, the \r\n  family courtâ€™s responsibility is to closely examine the payorâ€™s good faith and \r\n  reasonable explanation for the decreased income.Â  Kelley, 324 S.C. at \r\n  489, 477 S.E.2d at 731.Â  \r\nDuring the marriage, Husband and Wife were joint \r\n  owners of a family business, the Walters Company.Â  Husband is also a fifty-percent \r\n  owner of Carolina Service Group, but reported he does not receive any income \r\n  from this business.Â  However, the family court found Husbandâ€™s testimony concerning \r\n  his income was not credible.\r\nHusband was employed by the Walters Company at \r\n  the time the divorce action was filed.Â  For purposes of the temporary hearing, \r\n  Husband reported his income as $16,045 per month.Â  Conversely, at trial his \r\n  financial declaration indicated his income was only $4,418 per month.Â  Husband \r\n  testified his income decreased because the Walters Company lost an account that \r\n  constituted sixty-percent of the companyâ€™s income.Â  In his cross-examination \r\n  testimony, however, Husband stated the business had not lost any accounts and \r\n  suffered no adverse conditions other than the divorce and the effects from the \r\n  attacks on September 11, 2001.Â  \r\nWe conclude the discrepancies in Husbandâ€™s testimony \r\n  regarding his income and the financial standing of the Walters Company, coupled \r\n  with his inability to provide a reasonable explanation for his reported decrease \r\n  in income, support the family courtâ€™s determination that Husbandâ€™s testimony \r\n  was not credible. [2] Â  Therefore, \r\n  we agree with the decision of the family court to disregard Husbandâ€™s asserted \r\n  decrease in income and to impute income to him consistent with his historical \r\n  earnings.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-3-130(C)(4) &amp; 20-3-130(C)(6) \r\n  (Supp. 2002) (requiring family court to consider â€œthe employment history and \r\n  earning potential of each spouseâ€ and â€œthe current and reasonably \r\n  anticipated earnings of both spousesâ€ when \r\n  awarding alimony) (emphasis added). \r\nReviewing the five-year period immediately prior \r\n  to separation, [3]  the family \r\n  court found the Walters Company income averaged $183,000, \r\n  [4]  and imputed income to Husband in the amount of $150,000 per year. [5] Â  As these findings are supported \r\n  by the record, we conclude the family court did not abuse its discretion by \r\n  imputing $150,000 annual income to Husband.Â  \r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Wifeâ€™s Expenses\r\nHusband argues the family court erred by awarding \r\n  $3,000 per month permanent periodic alimony to Wife based on inflated expenses \r\n  reported by Wife.Â  We disagree.\r\nAlthough Husband claims that Wifeâ€™s expenses \r\n  are inflated, he provides no evidence to support this assertion.Â  The family \r\n  court found, and the evidence supports, Wifeâ€™s reported monthly needs of approximately \r\n  $3,100 were reasonable.Â  Husbandâ€™s unsubstantiated claim to the contrary raises \r\n  a question of credibility, and we defer to the family court on this issue.Â  \r\n  See Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. \r\n  445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996) (â€œBecause the appellate court \r\n  lacks the opportunity for direct observation of the witnesses, it should accord \r\n  great deference to trial court findings where matters of credibility are involved.â€).Â  \r\n\r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Lifestyle Financed by DebtÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nHusband argues the family court erred by awarding \r\n  $3,000 per month permanent periodic alimony to Wife based on the partiesâ€™ lifestyle \r\n  maintained during the marriage because it was beyond their means.Â  We disagree.\r\nHusband claims the family \r\n  court was penalizing him for both partiesâ€™ excessive lifestyle as evidenced \r\n  by the family courtâ€™s statements â€œthatâ€™s the way he let her liveâ€¦â€ and â€œI made \r\n  him accept responsibility.â€Â  We disagree with this interpretation.Â  Reviewing \r\n  these statements in context, the family court was merely responding to Husbandâ€™s \r\n  assertion that he should not be responsible for paying the debt incurred by \r\n  the parties during the marriage because he was unaware of Wifeâ€™s expenditures.Â  \r\n  These statements reflect the family courtâ€™s belief that Husband was not only \r\n  aware of Wifeâ€™s expenditures, but he contributed to the exorbitant amount of \r\n  debt incurred and should be required to pay a portion of it.Â  \r\nFurthermore, in awarding alimony, the family court \r\n  expressly considered the relevant factors as set out in South Carolina Code \r\n  Annotated section 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2002).Â  Specifically, the court considered \r\n  the unpaid debt incurred by the parties in maintaining their high standard of \r\n  living during the marriage, the fact the parties were married for twenty-five \r\n  years, and that Wife is forty-seven years old and earns twelve dollars per hour, \r\n  while Husband has the ability to earn more than $150,000 per year. \r\n  [6] Â  \r\nD.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Alimony as a Disincentive\r\nHusband argues the family court erred by awarding \r\n  $3,000 per month permanent periodic alimony to Wife because it will act as a \r\n  disincentive for Wife to contribute to her own support.Â  Husband contends Wifeâ€™s \r\n  failure to seek a better paying job is evidence of her lack of incentive to \r\n  provide for her own support.Â  \r\nWife is employed at Blue Cross-Blue Shield, earning \r\n  twelve dollars per hour.Â  Wife obtained this job in January 2000, shortly before \r\n  the separation, so the parties would have health insurance.Â  After reviewing \r\n  Wifeâ€™s monthly income and expenses, the family court found Wifeâ€™s needs of $3,100 \r\n  per month reasonable.Â  The family court also considered the length of the marriage, \r\n  the age of the parties, and the disparity of income between the parties.Â  Husband \r\n  admitted that Wife had been a good wife, mother, and homemaker, and that throughout \r\n  the marriage, he frequently traveled on business while Wife remained home caring \r\n  for their two children.Â  \r\nBecause the lifestyle enjoyed by the parties during \r\n  their marriage far exceeded $3,000 per month, Wife is forced to contribute to \r\n  her own support if she is to maintain any semblance of it.Â  As the purpose of \r\n  alimony is to place the supported spouse in the position of support enjoyed \r\n  during the marriage, we find Husbandâ€™s argument to be without merit.Â  JohnsonÂ­, \r\n  296 S.C. at 300, 372 S.E.2d at 113.\r\nWe conclude the family court did not abuse its \r\n  discretion by awarding Wife permanent periodic alimony in the amount of $3,000 \r\n  per month.Â  This amount, together with her own income, should be sufficient \r\n  to allow Wife to attain some semblance of the lifestyle she enjoyed during the \r\n  marriage.Â  See JohnsonÂ­, 296 S.C. at 300, 372 S.E.2d at 113 (holding \r\n  â€œthe purpose of alimony is to place the supported spouse, as nearly as practical, \r\n  in the position of support she enjoyed during the marriageâ€).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Identification \r\n  of Marital Property\r\nHusband argues the family court erred \r\n  by classifying certain personal property as nonmarital.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nMarital property is â€œall real and personal property \r\n  which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned \r\n  as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation.â€Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-7-473(1) (Supp. 2002).Â  However, â€œproperty acquired by either party \r\n  by inheritance, devise, bequest, or gift from a party other than the spouseâ€ \r\n  is considered nonmarital property.Â  Id.Â  Apportionment of marital property \r\n  is within the discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed on appeal \r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Greene, 351 S.C. at 340, 569 S.E.2d at \r\n  399. \r\nâ€œ[N]onmarital property may be transmuted into marital \r\n  property if it (1) becomes so commingled with marital property as to be untraceable;Â  \r\n  (2) is titled jointly;Â  or (3) is utilized by the parties in support of the \r\n  marriage or in some other manner so as to evidence an intent by the parties \r\n  to make it marital property.â€Â  Calhoun v. Calhoun, 339 S.C. 96, 106, \r\n  529 S.E.2d 14, 20 (2000).Â  The spouse claiming transmutation must produce objective \r\n  evidence demonstrating that, during the marriage, the parties themselves regarded \r\n  the property as common property of the marriage.Â  Hatfield v. Hatfield, \r\n  327 S.C. 360, 368, 489 S.E.2d 212, 217 (Ct. App. 1997).Â Â Â  \r\nThe property at issue, including a dinette, sterling \r\n  silver, and childrenâ€™s furniture, were gifts to Wife from her relatives.Â  Husband \r\n  claims Wifeâ€™s testimony regarding the familyâ€™s use of the property clearly establishes \r\n  an intent to treat it as marital property.Â  Although this property was used \r\n  in the marital home, Wife testified she did not intend for it to become marital \r\n  property.Â  Therefore, the evidence supports the family courtâ€™s conclusion that \r\n  no transmutation occurred.Â  See Murray v. Murray, 312 S.C. 154, \r\n  157, 439 S.E.2d 312, 315 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding mere use of separate property, \r\n  without additional evidence of intent to treat it as marital property, is not \r\n  sufficient to establish transmutation).Â  Thus, the family court did not err \r\n  by classifying the property as nonmarital.\r\nIII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Modification\r\nHusband argues the family court erred \r\n  by modifying the divorce decree sua sponte and awarding Wife the linen \r\n  press when neither party asked for the relief granted.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo preserve an issue raised by an order in response \r\n  to a post-trial motion, the complainant must make a successive motion to alter \r\n  or amend the new judgment.Â  See Pelican Bldg. Ctrs. v. Dutton, \r\n  311 S.C. 56, 60, 427 S.E.2d 673, 675 (1993) (holding that â€œalthough the appellant \r\n  learned for the first time upon receiving the order on a post-trial motion that \r\n  the respondent would be granted certain additional relief, the appellant must \r\n  move under Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to alter or amend the judgment to preserve the \r\n  record for appealâ€).Â  â€œ[A] second motion for reconsideration is appropriate \r\n  only if it challenges something that was altered from the original judgment \r\n  as a result of the initial motion for reconsideration.Â  In such a case, a new \r\n  judgment has replaced the previous judgment and the party aggrieved by the alteration \r\n  may move for reconsideration.â€Â  Coward Hund Const. Co., v. Ball Corp., 336 S.C. 1, 3, 518 S.E.2d \r\n  56, 58 (Ct. App. 1999). \r\nIn her motion for reconsideration, Wife generally \r\n  asked for a reconsideration of the allocation of personal property.Â  At the \r\n  hearing, Wifeâ€™s counsel specifically requested that Wife be given the linen \r\n  press in exchange for crediting Husband for alimony or paying him cash.Â  The \r\n  family court granted Wifeâ€™s motion to modify the allocation of personal property \r\n  by awarding Wife the linen press.Â  Although the family court awarded Wife the \r\n  linen press, it did so in lieu of a refund generated from the return of a cherry \r\n  secretary to the seller rather than in exchange for alimony credit or cash as \r\n  requested by Wife.Â  Husband contends, by providing this unrequested relief, \r\n  the family court modified the divorce decree sua sponte.Â  \r\nHowever, Husband did not object or make a motion \r\n  for reconsideration in response to the new allocation of property judgment.Â  \r\n  As Husband failed to make a motion for reconsideration from this ruling, this \r\n  issue is not preserved for appellate review. See Coward Hund Const. Co., 336 S.C. at 3, 518 S.E.2d at \r\n  58 (holding a second motion for reconsideration is necessary if it challenges \r\n  something that was altered from the original judgment as a result of the initial \r\n  motion for reconsideration).Â  \r\nIV.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nHusband contends the family court erred \r\n  by requiring him to pay $10,000 of Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe award of attorneyâ€™s fees is left to \r\n  the discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent \r\n  an abuse of discretion.Â  Smith v. Smith, 308 S.C. 492, 496, 419 S.E.2d \r\n  232, 234-35 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  The factors to be considered in awarding reasonable \r\n  attorney fees and costs include the:Â  (1) nature, extent, and difficulty of \r\n  the case;Â  (2) time necessarily devoted to the case;Â  (3) professional standing \r\n  of counsel;Â  (4) contingency of compensation;Â  (5) beneficial results obtained;Â  \r\n  and (6) customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, \r\n  304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).\r\nIn considering the award of attorney fees, the \r\n  family court found that Wifeâ€™s attorney is a long-standing practitioner in the \r\n  family court, beneficial results were obtained, the fees were reasonable in \r\n  relation to the complexity of the case, and there was a substantial disparity \r\n  of income between the parties.Â  In light of the factors enumerated in Glasscock, \r\n  the family court did not abuse its discretion by awarding attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the family court is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HOWARD, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concurring.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Husband did not file a motion to reconsider this \r\n    ruling.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The family court also noted that Husband claimed only one-half of \r\n    the Walters Company net income in 2000 ($58,000), reporting the other one-half \r\n    as income to Wife, due to her ownership interest in the company.Â  However, \r\n    no distribution of the income was made to Wife and Husband retained the entire \r\n    $116,000 income.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Husband argues the family court erred by considering outdated and \r\n    unreliable income figures for the Walters Company from the years 1995 through \r\n    1999.Â  He argues these figures are unreliable but gives no basis for the assertion \r\n    other than they were five years old at the time of trial.Â  However, the family \r\n    court concluded the recent figures reported by Husband were unreliable and \r\n    we agree with this conclusion.Â  Thus, we see no error in the consideration \r\n    of the income reported by the Walters Company over the five-year period in \r\n    question.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Husband argues the family court erred in calculating the Walters \r\n    Company income for this five-year period.Â  The family court found the average \r\n    gross income for the years 1995-1999 was $183,000.Â  Conversely, Husband claims \r\n    the actual average for this time period was $164,460.Â  However, the family \r\n    court only imputed $150,000 to Husband as annual income.Â  Assuming, without \r\n    deciding, the family court erred in its calculation, the imputation of $150,000 \r\n    annual income is still well below Husbandâ€™s calculation of the average income \r\n    for this time period.Â  Thus, we find no reversible error.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  In addition to this income, the family court concluded \r\n    that Husband owns a fifty percent share of Carolina Service Group, Inc., which \r\n    had gross sales of $900,000 in the year 2000.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  Husband argues the family court failed to consider his expenses in \r\n    relation to his earning capacity.Â  However, the family court order is replete \r\n    with evidence of the courtâ€™s consideration of both partiesâ€™ income and expenses.Â  \r\n    Therefore, we find this argument to be without merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-154","title":"Mappin Industries v.

Watson, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-154\r\nSubmitted February 9, 2004 â€“ Filed March \r\n  9, 2004 \r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nD. GarrisonÂ  Hill, of Greenville, for Appellants.\r\nW. Howard Boyd, Jr. and Fred W. Suggs, III, both of Greenville, \r\n  for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This case involves a change \r\n  of life insurance beneficiary form executed but not received by the insurance \r\n  companyâ€™s home office before the insuredâ€™s death.Â  The owners of the policy \r\n  brought this action against the insurance broker responsible for delivering \r\n  the change of beneficiary form, alleging his failure constituted breach of contract \r\n  and negligence.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the broker.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1997, Mappin Industries obtained a \r\n  loan from SouthTrust Bank.Â  Roberta Mappin, the sole shareholder of Mappin Industries, \r\n  signed for the loan, and Charles Theodore, a business associate of both Roberta \r\n  and her husband George, cosigned for the loan.Â  As a condition of the loan, \r\n  SouthTrust required that Mappin Industries buy insurance policies on the lives \r\n  of both Roberta and Charles in the amount of one million dollars each.Â  Mappin \r\n  Industries bought these required policies from First Colony Life Insurance Company \r\n  through Larry V. Mullins, an insurance broker in Greenville.Â  The proceeds of \r\n  the polices were assigned to SouthTrust.\r\nMappin Industriesâ€™ loan was subsequently \r\n  acquired by Carolina First Bank, which did not require an assignment of life \r\n  insurance proceeds.Â  However, Mappin Industries continued to pay the premiums \r\n  on the policies.\r\nIn the latter part of 1999, Charles informed \r\n  the Mappins that he had cancer and requested that they allow his wife, Patricia, \r\n  to be the beneficiary of a portion of the life insurance policy Mappin Industries \r\n  had on his life.Â  Pursuant to this conversation, George Mappin, as president \r\n  of Mappin Industries, executed a First Colony Insurance change of beneficiary \r\n  form making Roberta Mappin and Patricia Theodore each fifty percent beneficiaries \r\n  of the policy. The Mappins also testified that they instructed Mullins to obtain \r\n  a release of the assignment of the policy death benefits from South Trust Bank \r\n  and obtain an assignment of the proceeds in favor of Carolina First Bank in \r\n  the amount of $820,000.Â  Thus, in the event of Charlesâ€™ death, Mappin Industriesâ€™ \r\n  loan from Carolina First would be paid off, and the remaining $180,000 would \r\n  be split between Roberta Mappin and Patricia Theodore.Â  Mullins testified that \r\n  he delivered the change of beneficiary form to his administrative assistant, \r\n  who forwarded the form to First Colony Insurance. However, Mullins denied ever \r\n  being told to assign proceeds to Carolina First.\r\nOn December 1, 1999, another change of \r\n  beneficiary form was executed by George Mappin.Â  Under this second change, Roberta \r\n  Mappin was to receive eighty percent of the proceeds under the policy and Patricia \r\n  Theodore was to receive twenty percent. With this arrangement, upon Charlesâ€™ \r\n  death, Roberta would receive $800,000, Patricia would receive $200,000, and \r\n  there was no assignment to the bank.Â  As with the first change, Mullins claims \r\n  he forwarded the second change form to First Colonyâ€™s home office. \r\nCharles Theodore died on December 18, \r\n  1999. On January 6, 2000, Roberta Mappin and Patricia Theodore submitted their \r\n  claims to Mullins for the one million dollar death benefitâ€”claiming their respective \r\n  $800,000 and $200,000 shares.Â  Mullins forwarded the claims to First Colony. \r\n\r\nFirst Colony, however, claimed it had \r\n  not received the second, December 1, 1999, change form. Due to this discrepancy \r\n  in its records, First Colony filed a petition of interpleader to determine what \r\n  share of the proceeds each beneficiary was entitled to receive. First Colony \r\n  agreed to pay Mappin $500,000 and Theodore $200,000, and paid the disputed $300,000 \r\n  into the court. \r\nMappin and Theodore were able to resolve \r\n  their dispute outside of court, agreeing to a fifty-fifty split of the $300,000.Â  \r\n  The parties also agreed to the entry of a consent order dismissing the interpleader \r\n  action and releasing First Colony from any further claims. Mullins, however, \r\n  was excluded from the release of liability. \r\nUltimately, Roberta Mappin and Mappin \r\n  Industries (collectively â€œMappinâ€) brought the present action against Mullins, \r\n  claiming he had breached his contract and was negligent in failing to ensure \r\n  that the second change of beneficiary form was received and acknowledged by \r\n  First Colony. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Mullins, \r\n  finding there was no genuine issue of material fact.Â  In its summary judgment \r\n  order, the trial court also denied Mappinâ€™s motion to amend its complaint to \r\n  state additional causes of action.Â  Mappin appeals both of these rulings. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA trial court should grant a motion for summary \r\n  judgment when â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions \r\n  on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine \r\n  issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment \r\n  as a matter of law.â€ Rule 56(c), SCRCP; see also Fleming v. Rose, \r\n  350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  â€œIn determining whether any \r\n  triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably \r\n  drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving \r\n  party.â€ Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, \r\n  61, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998).Â  If triable issues of fact exist, those issues \r\n  must go to the jury. Young v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 333 S.C. 714, 717, \r\n  511 S.E.2d 413, 415 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Motion for Summary Judgment\r\nMappin argues the trial court erred in granting Mullinsâ€™ \r\n  motion for summary judgment on the claims for breach of contract and negligence.Â  \r\n  Specifically, Mappin asserts Mullins breached his duty of care under contract \r\n  and common law by failing to ensure that the change of beneficiary form was \r\n  received and acknowledged by First Colonyâ€™s home office prior to Charles Theodoreâ€™s \r\n  death.Â  We disagree.\r\nIt is well-settled that â€œ[a]n essential \r\n  element in a cause of action for negligence is the existence of a legal duty \r\n  of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff.Â  Without a duty, there is no \r\n  actionable negligence.â€ Bishop v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Mental Health, 331 S.C. \r\n  79, 86, 502 S.E.2d 78, 81 (1998).Â  As a general rule, â€œinsurance agents and \r\n  brokers â€˜are required to exercise due care in placing insurance and would be \r\n  personally liable for the neglect of that duty.â€™â€ Riddle-Duckworth, Inc. \r\n  v. Sullivan, 253 S.C. 411, 420, 171 S.E.2d 486, 490 (1969) (quoting La \r\n  Tourette v. McMaster, 104 S.C. 501, 89 S.E. 398 (1916)). \r\nIn the present case, however, Mappin \r\n  has failed to show any facts indicating Mullins owed a duty to deliver Mappinâ€™s \r\n  change of beneficiary form prior to Theodoreâ€™s death.Â  On the contrary, under \r\n  South Carolina law, an insured has effectively changed a beneficiary under a \r\n  life insurance policy when he has â€œsubstantially complied with the method prescribed \r\n  by the policy language for changing the beneficiary.â€ Life of Georgia Ins. \r\n  Co. v. Bolton, 333 S.C. 406, 411, 509 S.E.2d 488, 491 (1998).Â  As in the \r\n  present case, the plaintiffs in Bolton argued that the failure of the \r\n  insurance company to receive a change of beneficiary form in its home office \r\n  rendered the change ineffective. Id. The supreme court rejected this \r\n  argument, finding the change was effective as of the time the owner or insured \r\n  executed a change of beneficiary form. Id.Â  \r\nIn the present case, the terms of the insurance \r\n  policy regarding the procedure for executing a change of beneficiary did not \r\n  require that the form be delivered or acknowledged by First Colonyâ€™s home office \r\n  in order to be effective.Â  The policy provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\r\n\r\nCHANGE OF OWNER AND BENEFICIARY.Â  \r\n  The Owner may change the designations of Owner and Beneficiary during the Insuredâ€™s \r\n  lifetime.Â  Any change is subject to the consent of an irrevocable beneficiary.Â  \r\n  Written notice of change must be filed at the home office in a form acceptable \r\n  to the company.Â  The new designation will then take effect as of the date the \r\n  Owner signed the notice.Â  Such a change does not affect any payment made or \r\n  other action taken by the Company before the notice is received. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mullins was required to provide written notice to \r\n  First Colonyâ€™s home office under this provision, the language did not condition \r\n  the effectiveness of the change of beneficiary upon First Colonyâ€™s receipt of \r\n  the form or otherwise mandate delivery of the form within an essential time \r\n  period.Â  Mullins did not, therefore, have a dutyâ€”under principles of contract \r\n  or common lawâ€”to ensure First Colony received the change of beneficiary form \r\n  at its home office prior to Charles Theodoreâ€™s death in order for it to be effective.Â  \r\n\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Motion to Amend\r\nMappin also appeals the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  denial of its motion to amend its complaint to assert three additional claims.Â  \r\n  Under Rule 15(a), SCRCP, the trial court may grant a party leave to amend a \r\n  complaint or other pleading and shall do so â€œfreelyâ€ â€œwhen justice so requires \r\n  and does not prejudice any other party.â€Â  The trial judgeâ€™s finding will not \r\n  be overturned absent an abuse of discretion or unless manifest injustice has \r\n  occurred. Berry v. McCloud, 328 S.C. 435, 450, 492 S.E.2d 794, 802 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1997).Â  We find no abuse of discretion in the trial courtâ€™s denial of Mappinâ€™s \r\n  motion to amend.\r\nIn its motion to amend, Mappin first \r\n  sought to assert a new claim alleging Mullins was negligent in failing to obtain \r\n  an assignment of the policy in favor of Carolina First Bank.Â  Mappin had requested \r\n  Mullins make this assignment following the November 11, 1999, conference at \r\n  which George Mappin executed the first change of beneficiary form.Â  As both \r\n  Roberta and George Mappin acknowledged in their deposition testimony, however, \r\n  this agreement was superseded by the December 1, 1999, agreement under which \r\n  Mappin and Charles Theodore agreed to provide $200,000 from the death benefits \r\n  to Patricia Theodore.Â  In light of this agreementâ€”which gave rise to the need \r\n  for the second change of beneficiaryâ€”George and Roberta Mappin testified they \r\n  no longer wished to have the assignment made in favor of the bank.Â  By the Mappinsâ€™ \r\n  own testimony, therefore, the question of whether Mullins was negligent in failing \r\n  to obtain an assignment of the insurance proceeds in favor of the bank is wholly \r\n  irrelevant to the present case.\r\nNext, Mappin asked the trial court to add a claim \r\n  that Mullins should be barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel \r\n  from taking a position contrary to the position taken by First Colony in the \r\n  interpleader action.Â  This request is also without merit.\r\nRes judicata bars subsequent actions \r\n  by the same parties when the claims arise out of the same transaction or occurrence \r\n  that was the subject of a prior action between these parties.Â  Nelson v. \r\n  QHG of S.C. Inc., 354 S.C. 290, 304, 580 S.E.2d 171, 178 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\n  Likewise, the doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes relitigation of claims \r\n  in subsequent suits involving the same parties or those in privity with the \r\n  previous parties. Carrigg v. Cannon, 347 S.C. 75, 79-80, 552 S.E.2d 767, \r\n  770 (Ct. App. 2001) (holding that â€œ[u]nder the doctrine of collateral estoppel, \r\n  once a final judgment on the merits has been reached in a prior claim, the relitigation \r\n  of those issues actually and necessarily litigated and determined in the first \r\n  suit are precluded as to the parties and their privies in any subsequent action \r\n  based upon a different claimâ€ (internal quotation marks omitted)).\r\nIn the present case, Mullins was not a party to the \r\n  interpleader action initiated by First Colony.Â  Nor can it be argued that Mullins \r\n  was in privity with any party to that action, as demonstrated by the fact that \r\n  Mullins was specifically excluded from the settlement reached in the interpleader \r\n  action.Â  Therefore, Mappinâ€™s attempt to argue that Mullins is now barred from \r\n  asserting his affirmative defenses in the instant action is manifestly without \r\n  merit.\r\nFinally, Mappin sought to amend its complaint to request \r\n  additional damages to compensate for the attorneyâ€™s fees and costs it incurred \r\n  in defending the interpleader action.Â  As discussed above, however, Mullins \r\n  breached no duty under contract or common law which gave rise to the interpleader \r\n  action.Â  The fees and costs were incurred solely by reason of First Colonyâ€™s \r\n  wrongful refusal to honor the second change of beneficiary form which was executed \r\n  on December 1, 1999.Â  Accordingly, there is no basis under the applicable South \r\n  Carolina law to allow Mappin to recover the fees and costs incurred in defending \r\n  the interpleader action.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude the trial court properly granted \r\n  summary judgment in favor of Mullins, finding no evidence of any duty owed under \r\n  contract or common law theories of recovery.Â  Additionally, we find the trial \r\n  court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mappinâ€™s motion to amend.Â  The \r\n  ruling of the trial court is therefore\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., ANDERSON and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-155","title":"Law v.

DeVane, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nMargaret D. Fabri, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Norris Samuel Law, \r\n  III (Father) brought an action against Penny Jean Morris Law (Mother) alleging \r\n  several changes in circumstances that would justify a change in custody of their \r\n  daughter.Â  The family court judge granted custody to Father with visitation \r\n  to Mother every other weekend, alternating holidays, and one month in the summer.Â  \r\n  Mother appeals.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nMother and Father separated \r\n  in June of 1997 and entered into an agreement concerning the custody of their \r\n  then two-year-old daughter, Grayson.Â  The agreement provided they would share \r\n  joint legal custody of Grayson, with Mother having primary physical custody \r\n  and Father having secondary physical custody with â€œliberal rights of visitation.â€Â  \r\n  The parties also agreed that neither Mother nor Father would have the minor \r\n  child in their home if a paramour was visiting overnight.Â  The parties divorced \r\n  in September of 1997 and incorporated the agreement into their final decree \r\n  of divorce.Â  \r\nAt some time near the end of 1997, Father \r\n  began living with his girlfriend, Jennifer, whom he married in January 1999.Â  \r\n  Mother also began living with her boyfriend, Jason Belcher, during 1997.Â  Mother \r\n  later married Mr. Belcher on August 22, 2000.Â  From 1997 to August 2000, Mother \r\n  and Father shared custody of Grayson on nearly a fifty-fifty basis.Â  Initially, \r\n  Mother had physical custody of Grayson one week and Father had physical custody \r\n  the next week.Â  At some point in 1998, Mother proposed a modified visitation \r\n  schedule, and the parties agreed to Grayson alternating three days with Mother \r\n  and two days with Father.Â  \r\nAccording to Father, Mother attempted \r\n  to change the visitation schedule every three months or so.Â  Father testified \r\n  that in order to ensure he had time with Grayson, he would pay more money for \r\n  daycare or dance class, in addition to his child support obligation.Â  In September \r\n  1999, Mother sent Father a letter in which she attempted to change Fatherâ€™s \r\n  visitation to every other Friday through Monday.Â  Mother also set forth Fatherâ€™s \r\n  different payment obligations and informed Father she would be performing all \r\n  â€œmotheringâ€ duties, such as taking Grayson for doctor visits, buying clothes, \r\n  and making decisions regarding Graysonâ€™s extracurricular activities.Â  Following \r\n  this letter, the parties ultimately compromised on an alternative visitation \r\n  schedule giving Father three weekends plus one week with Grayson every month.Â  \r\n  However, in August of 2000, Mother phoned Father and notified him that because \r\n  Grayson was beginning elementary school his visitation would be limited to every \r\n  other weekend.Â  Father tape recorded this telephone conversation. Â \r\nOn August 21, 2000, Father filed this \r\n  action alleging a substantial change in circumstances supporting a change in \r\n  custody and seeking an emergency ex parte order of custody.Â  Father \r\n  pled, in the alternative, for joint custody of Grayson, with the non-custodial \r\n  parent to have liberal rights of visitation which he defined as â€œa minimum of \r\n  fifty percent (50%) of the time, temporarily and permanently.â€Â  Mother counterclaimed \r\n  for sole custody.Â  An ex parte order granted custody to Father \r\n  on August 21, 2000, and a hearing was set for August 23, 2000.Â  At the hearing, \r\n  Father was granted temporary custody.Â  Motherâ€™s motion for a stay of the temporary \r\n  order and petition for supersedeas were denied.Â  \r\nAt the final merits hearing in June 2001, \r\n  Mother objected on several occasions to Fatherâ€™s attorneyâ€™s line of questioning, \r\n  arguing that because this was an action for a change of custody rather than \r\n  a de novo proceeding, Father should not be permitted to introduce \r\n  any evidence other than that relating to the alleged changes in circumstances.Â  \r\n  The family court judge admitted the testimony, finding it relevant.Â  In addition, \r\n  a transcript of the August 2000 telephone conversation was admitted at the hearing \r\n  over Motherâ€™s objection.Â  The family court issued a final order on September \r\n  28, 2001, granting sole custody to Father, with visitation for Mother to include \r\n  alternating weekends, alternating holidays, and one month in the summer.Â  Mother \r\n  appeals.Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nDecisions affecting the custody \r\n  of a child are matters left principally to the discretion of the family court.Â Â  \r\n  Shirley v. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324, 330, 536 S.E.2d 427, 430 (Ct. App. \r\n  2000).Â  However, in appeals from the family court, this court has the authority \r\n  to find facts in accordance with our view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  \r\n  Greene v. Greene, 351 S.C. 329, 335, 569 S.E.2d 393, 397 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\n  This broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the findings of \r\n  the family court.Â  Id.Â  Nor does it require us to ignore the fact that \r\n  the family court judge, â€œwho saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position \r\n  to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.â€Â  \r\n  Id. (citation omitted).Â  An appellate court should be reluctant to substitute \r\n  its own evaluation of the evidence on child custody for that of the family court.Â  \r\n  Shirley, 342 S.C. at 331, 536 S.E.2d at 430.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Custody\r\nIn arguing the family court erred in \r\n  awarding custody to the Father, Mother asserts that the court incorrectly treated \r\n  this case as a de novo custody dispute instead of a change of \r\n  custody dispute.Â  See Allison v. Eudy, 330 S.C. 427, 429, 499 \r\n  S.E.2d 227, 228 (Ct. App. 1998) (stating that a finding in the family courtâ€™s \r\n  order denying a motion for reconsideration that â€œâ€˜the scales tip in [the non-movantâ€™s \r\n  favor],â€™â€ indicated the family court incorrectly treated the change in custody \r\n  action as a de novo custody dispute).Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn all child custody cases, the paramount \r\n  considerations are the childâ€™s welfare and best interests.Â  Hollar v. Hollar, \r\n  342 S.C. 463, 472, 536 S.E.2d 883, 888 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The party seeking a \r\n  change in custody assumes the burden of proof and must show changed circumstances \r\n  occurring subsequent to the entry of the original custody order that substantially \r\n  affect the interest and welfare of the child.Â  See id. at 473, \r\n  536 S.E.2d at 888.Â  In determining a change in custody, the family court should \r\n  consider how the custody decision will impact all areas of the childâ€™s life \r\n  and must assess each partyâ€™s character, fitness and attitude as they impact \r\n  the child.Â  Shirley, 342 S.C. at 330, 536 S.E.2d at 430.Â Â  â€œâ€˜There are \r\n  no hard and fast rules for determining when to change custody and the totality \r\n  of the circumstances peculiar to each case constitutes the only scale upon which \r\n  the ultimate decision can be weighed.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting Davenport v. \r\n  Davenport, 265 S.C. 524, 527, 220 S.E.2d 228, 230 (1975)).Â  In order to \r\n  determine whether a change in circumstances has been shown, the court must consider \r\n  the facts leading up to and surrounding the present controversy.Â  Stutz v. \r\n  Funderburk, 272 S.C. 273, 277, 252 S.E.2d 32, 34 (1979).Â  The usual factors \r\n  family courts consider in determining the best interests of children are appropriate \r\n  considerations.Â  Glanton v. Glanton, 314 S.C. 58, 60 n. 3, 443 S.E.2d \r\n  810, 811 n.3 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\nIn support of Motherâ€™s argument that \r\n  the family court incorrectly treated this change of custody case as a de \r\n  novo custody dispute, Mother asks this court to consider, (1) Fatherâ€™s \r\n  testimony, over Motherâ€™s objection, about Motherâ€™s family background and home \r\n  life, (2) comments made by the family court judge in a telephone conference, \r\n  and (3) that the final order mentioned the standard used for a de novo \r\n  custody case, in addition to the standard for a change in custody case.Â  We \r\n  do not believe Motherâ€™s assertions are sufficient to find the family court incorrectly \r\n  treated this case as a de novo custody dispute.Â  \r\nFirst, the testimony concerning Motherâ€™s \r\n  family background and home life, which was admitted over Motherâ€™s objections, \r\n  does not demonstrate that the judge improperly treated the case as a de \r\n  novo dispute.Â  Rather, the testimony demonstrates that the judge properly \r\n  admitted evidence related to the childâ€™s best interest and the totality of the \r\n  circumstances.Â  See Hollar, 342 S.C. at 472-73, 536 S.E.2d at \r\n  888; Shirley, 342 S.C. at 330, 536 S.E.2d at 430.Â  \r\nWe likewise reject Motherâ€™s second argument \r\n  that the family court judgeâ€™s remarks made during a telephone conference that \r\n  Father presented a better situation do not demonstrate that the case was treated \r\n  de novo.Â  Initially we note that no transcript of the telephone \r\n  conference appears in the record.Â  See Bonaparte v. Floyd, 291 \r\n  S.C. 427, 444, 354 S.E.2d 40, 50 (Ct. App. 1987) (stating that the appellant \r\n  has the burden of furnishing a sufficient record for this courtâ€™s review).Â Â  \r\n  Mother asks this court to consider her attorneyâ€™s restatement of these remarks \r\n  during a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, hearing as evidence that the family court judge \r\n  not only made the remarks but that the judge improperly treated the case as \r\n  a de novo custody dispute.Â  However, it is well settled law that \r\n  arguments of counsel do not constitute evidence.Â  See e.g. Sosebee \r\n  v. Leeke, 293 S.C. 531, 535, 362 S.E.2d 22, 24 (1987).Â  Further, these remarks \r\n  are not reflected in the final change of custody order except in the orderâ€™s \r\n  consideration of the best interests of the child and the totality of the circumstances.Â Â  \r\n  To the extent that the final order and the judgeâ€™s remarks at the Rule 59(e) \r\n  hearing are in conflict, the written order controls.Â  See Corbin v. \r\n  Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 621, 571 S.E.2d 92, 97 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  The final \r\n  order does not improperly use the de novo custody standard in \r\n  changing custody as Mother argues.Â  Mother is correct in that the order concludes, \r\n  based on the totality of the circumstances and the best interests of the child, \r\n  that Father should have the primary, sole custody of Grayson.Â  However, Mother \r\n  overlooks the courtâ€™s initial determination that â€œFather has shown a substantial \r\n  change in circumstance since the time of the partiesâ€™ agreement and original \r\n  custody order which impacts and affects the best interest of the child.â€Â  The \r\n  order also sets forth several changes in circumstance to support this finding.Â  \r\n  It was only after making this determination that the order addressed the childâ€™s \r\n  best interests based on the totality of the circumstances.Â  See Hollar, \r\n  342 S.C. at 472-73, 536 S.E.2d at 888; Shirley, 342 S.C. at 330, 536 \r\n  S.E.2d at 430.Â  \r\nMother also argues that the family court \r\n  erred in awarding custody to Father because Father failed to show a substantial \r\n  change in circumstances materially affecting the best interests of the child.Â  \r\n  Father alleged three changes in circumstance warranting a change in custody, \r\n  including: (1) Motherâ€™s unilateral decision to change Fatherâ€™s visitation, (2) \r\n  Fatherâ€™s remarriage and Graysonâ€™s close relationship with his new wife, and \r\n  (3) Motherâ€™s cohabitation with her boyfriend in violation of the prior court \r\n  order.Â Â  The family court judge changed custody to Father based on the totality \r\n  of the circumstances, including all three of the changed circumstances asserted \r\n  by Father.Â  We affirm the family court order changing custody to the Father \r\n  based on Motherâ€™s decision to significantly reduce Fatherâ€™s visitation with \r\n  Grayson.\r\nIn order to grant a change of custody, the \r\n  party seeking the change bears the burden of showing changed circumstances occurring \r\n  subsequent to the entry of the original custody decree.Â  Kisling v. Allison, \r\n  343 S.C. 674, 679, 541 S.E.2d 273, 275 (Ct. App. 2001) (quoting Shirley, \r\n  342 S.C. at 330, 536 S.E.2d at 430).Â  The change in circumstance relied on must \r\n  be one that would substantially affect the interest and welfare of the child, \r\n  not merely the wishes or convenience of the parties.Â  Id. at 679, 541 \r\n  S.E.2d at 275-76.\r\nIt was error for the family court judge \r\n  to consider Motherâ€™s live-in relationship to be a change of circumstances.Â  \r\n  â€œA parentâ€™s morality, while a proper factor for consideration, â€˜is limited in \r\n  its force to what relevancy it has, either directly or indirectly, to the welfare \r\n  of the child.â€™â€Â  Stroman v. Williams, 291 S.C. 376, 378, 353 S.E.2d 704, \r\n  705 (Ct. App. 1987) (citation omitted) (finding no material change in circumstances \r\n  occurred from motherâ€™s live-in relationship with lesbian partner where childâ€™s \r\n  welfare was not adversely affected).Â  In the present case, there is no evidence \r\n  showing Grayson was adversely affected by Mother and Stepfather living together \r\n  prior to marriage.Â  In fact, Father agreed that both Mother and Stepfather are \r\n  positive influences in Graysonâ€™s life, and the Stepfather has â€œassisted as [a \r\n  stepparent] in raising her, nurturing her, and attending to her needs.â€Â  In \r\n  addition, Father has had knowledge of Motherâ€™s cohabitation since 1997, and \r\n  Father himself cohabitated with his present wife prior to their marriage in \r\n  1999.Â  \r\nFurther, any adverse affect Motherâ€™s \r\n  cohabitation may have had on her moral fitness was remedied by Motherâ€™s subsequent \r\n  marriage to her boyfriend.Â  See Sealy v. Sealy, 295 S.C. 281, \r\n  284, 368 S.E.2d 85, 87 (Ct. App. 1988) (â€œ[R]emarriage which restores â€˜moral \r\n  fitnessâ€™ has been recognized as a factor to be considered in awarding change \r\n  of custody.â€); Baer v. Baer, 282 S.C. 362, 365, 318 S.E.2d 582, 583 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1984) (finding motherâ€™s marriage to her paramour reinstated her moral fitness).Â  \r\n  Finally, we do not see any merit to Fatherâ€™s argument that Motherâ€™s remarriage \r\n  demonstrated her lack of judgment because it occurred two days before the emergency \r\n  hearing.Â  Mother obviously intended to marry her boyfriend prior to Father filing \r\n  the present action, as evidenced by the fact that a marriage license was acquired \r\n  ten days prior to the filing.Â  There is no evidence to suggest that the timing \r\n  of Motherâ€™s remarriage materially affected the best interest and welfare of \r\n  Grayson.Â  See Baer, 282 S.C. at 365, 318 S.E.2d at 584 (finding \r\n  no evidence to show that motherâ€™s sudden marriage substantially affected the \r\n  welfare of the children).\r\nMoreover, although the consent order \r\n  prohibited Mother or Father from cohabiting with a member of the opposite sex \r\n  while Grayson was present, â€œ[t]he court may not award or change custody to punish \r\n  a parent for acting in violation of the orders of the court.â€Â  Smith v. Smith, \r\n  261 S.C. 81, 85, 198 S.E.2d 271, 273 (1973).Â  See also Stroman, \r\n  291 S.C. atÂ  378, 353 S.E.2d at 705 (â€œCustody is not to be used to penalize \r\n  or reward a parent for his or her conduct.â€).Â  In this case, it appears the \r\n  family court judge placed an unnecessary emphasis on Motherâ€™s cohabitation.Â  \r\n  After Stepfatherâ€™s redirect examination at the merits hearing, the family court \r\n  judge questioned Stepfather regarding the relationship he and Mother had with \r\n  their next-door neighbors, Charlie and Margie Creech, parents of the Honorable \r\n  Wayne M. Creech.Â  The judge asked, â€œDo you have anything to do with Judge Creechâ€™s \r\n  parents?â€Â  In response to Stepfatherâ€™s answer that the Creeches visited quite \r\n  often, the judge replied, â€œIâ€™m surprised to hear that.Â  Because I wouldnâ€™t think \r\n  he would have anything to do with anybody thatâ€™s living together without benefit \r\n  of marriage as straight-laced as he is and she is and Judge Creech is.Â  Iâ€™m \r\n  surprised they would have anything to do without [sic] anybody thatâ€™s living \r\n  together without the benefit of marriage.â€Â  The judgeâ€™s focus on this issue \r\n  continued when he questioned Margie Creech:\r\n\r\nTHE COURT: You gave an affidavit here and [it is] dated August \r\n  the 22nd in the year 2000.Â  If you would have known that [Mother \r\n  and Stepfather] were not married, would you have given that affidavit?Â  Would \r\n  you have given them an affidavit that said: How much you enjoyed them as neighbors \r\n  . . . .\r\nMARGIE CREECH: Yes, sir, I would have.\r\nTHE COURT: Even though they were not married.Â  They were \r\n  living together without the benefit of marriage and they were bringing their \r\n  daughter in there, a young child in there?\r\nMARGIE CREECH: Well, I donâ€™t guess that â€“ Iâ€™m not down on \r\n  anybody because of what they do because, you know, that I donâ€™t agree with it.Â  \r\n  Actually, I pray for them.Â  So, therefore, they were good parents, so thatâ€™s \r\n  all I could see is say what I see.Â  \r\n\r\nWe disagree with the emphasis placed on \r\n  the Motherâ€™s cohabitation prior to her present marriage by the family court \r\n  judge and with his finding that her cohabitation was a change in circumstances \r\n  sufficient to warrant a change in custody.Â  \r\nFurther, Fatherâ€™s current living \r\n  situation alone, including his remarriage and Graysonâ€™s relationship with Stepmother, \r\n  is not sufficient to support a change in custody.Â  See Fisher v. Miller, \r\n  288 S.C. 576, 578, 344 S.E.2d 149, 150 (1986) (stating remarriage alone is not \r\n  a substantial change of circumstances).Â  In this particular case, Grayson has \r\n  known both Stepmother and Stepfather since 1997, when both couples began dating.Â  \r\n  Graysonâ€™s relationship with her Stepmother in itself does not substantially \r\n  affect her welfare and thus does not qualify as a change in circumstances because \r\n  the evidence establishes that both Stepparents had been a positive influence \r\n  on her life for over three years prior to the time Father commenced this litigation.Â  \r\n\r\nHowever, we agree with the family \r\n  court judgeâ€™s determination that Motherâ€™s unilateral decision to significantly \r\n  reduce Fatherâ€™s visitation was a substantial change in circumstance materially \r\n  affecting the best interests and welfare of Grayson.Â  The original divorce decree \r\n  granted the parties joint custody of Grayson and gave Mother primary physical \r\n  custody and Father liberal rights of visitation.Â  The decree did not set forth \r\n  any guidelines as to how the parties should determine visitation nor did it \r\n  specifically define what liberal visitation would be.Â  Father exercised liberal \r\n  visitation from 1997 to August 2000.Â  During this time, Mother and Father shared \r\n  physical custody of Grayson.Â  Mother frequently attempted to change Fatherâ€™s \r\n  visitation schedule by reducing Fatherâ€™s visitation.Â  On each occasion, the \r\n  parties successfully negotiated an alternate visitation schedule, which gave \r\n  Father more time with his daughter.Â  Father testified that he would have to \r\n  agree to give Mother more money or take on additional expenses in order to have \r\n  more time with Grayson.Â  However, in August of 2000, Mother phoned Father and \r\n  notified him that because Grayson had started elementary school his visitation \r\n  would be limited to every other weekend.Â Â  Based on the transcript of this conversation, \r\n  Mother was unwilling to negotiate with Father regarding this new schedule and \r\n  even further reduced Fatherâ€™s access to Graysonâ€™s extracurricular activities \r\n  when he attempted to negotiate additional time with Grayson.Â  \r\nMother argues there is no evidence \r\n  in the record to show that her proposed visitation change negatively impacted \r\n  Grayson.Â  However, contrary to Motherâ€™s assertion, the requirement that the \r\n  party seeking to change custody must show a change of circumstances affecting \r\n  the interests and welfare of the child does not require a finding of a present \r\n  existing injury to the child.Â  See Routh v. Routh, 328 S.C. 512, \r\n  520, 492 S.E.2d 415, 419 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Rather, â€œ[a]n existing unhealthy \r\n  environment that is likely to impact on the child in the future, affects the \r\n  welfare of the child.â€Â  Id. at 520, 492 S.E.2d at 420.Â Â  In this case, \r\n  Mother has made repeated attempts to diminish Fatherâ€™s time with Grayson despite \r\n  the decree awarding the parties joint custody and the Father liberal visitation.Â  \r\n  Motherâ€™s final proposal of visitation every other weekend suggested a significant \r\n  reduction in the time Grayson had been spending with Father.Â  It is uncontroverted \r\n  that Grayson was thriving under the previous visitation schedule, which allowed \r\n  her to see Father nearly fifty percent of the time.Â  The Motherâ€™s new proposed \r\n  visitation schedule provided for visitation with Father only every other weekend \r\n  and would significantly limit Fatherâ€™s ability to be an active and positive \r\n  influence in Graysonâ€™s life.Â  Further, the transcript of the tape recorded telephone \r\n  conversation demonstrates that Mother was unwilling to compromise on the issue \r\n  and even suggested that Mother retaliated against Father by further reducing \r\n  his visitation.Â  As such, we find Motherâ€™s decision to significantly reduce \r\n  Fatherâ€™s visitation with Grayson substantially affected the welfare and best \r\n  interest of the child and constituted a change in circumstance warranting a \r\n  change in custody to Father.Â  See Watson v. Poole, 329 S.C. 232, \r\n  239, 495 S.E.2d 236, 240 (Ct. App. 1997) (changing custody to father based in \r\n  part on motherâ€™s unwillingness to facilitate the childâ€™s visitation with father \r\n  and arbitrarily canceling fatherâ€™s visitation);Â  Morehouse v. Morehouse, \r\n  317 S.C. 222, 226-27, 452 S.E.2d 632, 634-35 (Ct. App. 1994) (upholding an award \r\n  of custody to father where mother was unwilling to encourage a relationship \r\n  between the child and father).\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Motherâ€™s Visitation\r\nMother argues the family court erred in \r\n  restricting her visitation to every other weekend, alternating holidays, and \r\n  one month in the summer.Â  We agree.\r\nAlthough we affirm the change in custody \r\n  to Father due to Motherâ€™s unilateral decision to alter his visitation, we do \r\n  not believe the evidence supports an award of standard visitation to Mother.Â  \r\n  The welfare and best interests of the child are the primary considerations in \r\n  determining visitation.Â  Paparella v. Paparella, 340 S.C. 186, 191, 531 \r\n  S.E.2d 297, 300 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The family court has broad discretion to decide \r\n  visitation issues and its decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent an \r\n  abuse of discretion.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe type of visitation the judge granted \r\n  Mother in this case is considered â€œstandardâ€ visitation.Â  See Woodall \r\n  v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 12, 471 S.E.2d 154, 158 (1996).Â  Although visitation \r\n  tantamount to divided custody is disfavored, in certain circumstances courts \r\n  will expand visitation beyond standard.Â  See id. (stating that \r\n  visitation tantamount to divided custody is avoided).Â  But see \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(42) (Supp. 2003) (â€œThe family court shall have exclusive \r\n  jurisdiction . . . [t]o order joint or divided custody where the court finds \r\n  it is in the best interest of the child.â€);Â  Paparella, 340 S.C. at 191, \r\n  531 S.E.2d at 300 (finding the evidence did not support an award of standard \r\n  visitation to the father and expanding his visitation).Â  In Paparella, \r\n  this court granted additional visitation to the father because he was very involved \r\n  in raising his children and the mother testified she thought father should receive \r\n  more than just standard visitation.Â  340 S.C. at 191, 531 S.E.2d at 300.Â  Similarly, \r\n  there is overwhelming evidence in this case, including testimony from all four \r\n  parents, teachers, family members, and neighbors showing Grayson was thriving \r\n  on the previous visitation schedule, which allowed her to see both parents virtually \r\n  equally.Â  Father testified both parents had been very active in Graysonâ€™s life.Â  \r\n  Father also agreed it was healthy for Grayson to see both of her parents at \r\n  her ballgames and dance recitals.Â  Just as in Paparella, Father stated \r\n  he thought Mother should receive more than standard visitation.Â  He believed \r\n  both parents should have â€œliberal accessâ€ to Grayson.Â  He agreed if he were \r\n  in Motherâ€™s position, alternating weekends would not be fair.Â  Father even agreed \r\n  that the standard visitation would be detrimental to Graysonâ€™s well-being and \r\n  that all four parents should have equal access to her.Â  In fact, Father pled, \r\n  in the alternative, for a continuation of the joint custody arrangement the \r\n  parties had previously enjoyed.Â  \r\nMother testified she wanted the visitation \r\n  arrangement to go back to the way it was before she changed it, where both Mother \r\n  and Father spent equal amounts of time with Grayson.Â  Mother admitted it was \r\n  a mistake for her to change the schedule.Â  Referring to the every other weekend \r\n  visitation schedule, she stated, â€œI donâ€™t believe itâ€™s healthy for anyone to \r\n  be away from their child for that long,â€ and that standard visitation is not \r\n  in Graysonâ€™s best interests.Â  \r\nIn addition to the testimony of family and \r\n  friends, the guardian ad litem testified that it would be in Graysonâ€™s best \r\n  interests for her to spend time equally at each of her parentâ€™s homes.Â  \r\nBased on the above, we reverse the family \r\n  courtâ€™s order granting standard visitation to Mother.Â  While Father remains \r\n  the primary, sole custodian, we find Mother should receive expanded visitation \r\n  and remand this issue to the family court to establish a schedule consistent \r\n  with this opinion.\r\nIII.Â Â Â Â  Guardian Ad Litemâ€™s Recommendation\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Mother argues the family court erred \r\n  in failing to give proper weight to the recommendation of the guardian ad litem \r\n  and in failing to consider joint custody as recommended by the guardian ad litem. \r\n  [1] Â  In light of our determination that the family court did not err in \r\n  changing custody to Father and our remand of the visitation issue, we need not \r\n  reach this argument on appeal.Â Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of \r\n  Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (finding \r\n  it unnecessary to review remaining issues when disposition of prior issues are \r\n  dispositive).\r\nIV.Â Â Â Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nMother contends the family court erred \r\n  in awarding Father $23,469.79 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We agree that this issue \r\n  should be remanded for reconsideration by the family court judge in light of \r\n  our decision to remand the issue of visitation.\r\nThe award of attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  is left to the discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed absent \r\n  an abuse of discretion.Â  Smith v. Smith, 308 S.C. 492, 496, 419 S.E.2d \r\n  232, 234-35 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  The court considers the following factors in awarding \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees: (1) the beneficial results obtained; (2) the abilities of the \r\n  parties to pay; (3) the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions; and (4) the \r\n  effect of the attorneyâ€™s fees on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  E.D.M. \r\n  v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992) (citing Glasscock \r\n  v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403 S.E.2d 313 (1991)).Â  \r\nBecause we remand the issue of visitation \r\n  in order to give Mother expanded visitation, Fatherâ€™s beneficial results have \r\n  been altered.Â  Therefore, we remand this issue for a de novo review \r\n  by the family court.Â  \r\nAs to Motherâ€™s arguments regarding the \r\n  specific hourly rate charged, the hours incurred, or the expert witness fees, \r\n  these issues are not preserved.Â  Mother did not raise any objection to these \r\n  issues at trial.Â  An issue not raised at trial is not properly before an appellate \r\n  court.Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998).Â Â  \r\n  However, because we are remanding the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees de novo, \r\n  Mother may raise these issues on remand. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the family court did not err in finding \r\n  a substantial change in circumstances based on Motherâ€™s unilateral decision \r\n  to alter Fatherâ€™s visitation.Â  However, we find it is in Graysonâ€™s best interests \r\n  to spend considerable time with both of her parents.Â  Therefore, we reverse \r\n  the family courtâ€™s award of standard visitation to Mother, and remand this issue \r\n  for an increase in Motherâ€™s visitation consistent with this opinion.Â  We also \r\n  remand the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  For the foregoing reasons, the decision \r\n  of the family court is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., ANDERSON and BEATTY,\r\nJ.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  We note that subsequent to the merits hearing in this case, the South \r\n    Carolina General Assembly specifically addressed the role of private guardians \r\n    ad litem in family court actions in which custody or visitation of a minor \r\n    child is at issue.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1545 to â€“ 1557 (Supp. \r\n    2003).Â  In particular, the General Assembly made clear that a guardian may \r\n    only be appointed when â€œthe court will likely not be fully informed about \r\n    the facts of the case and there is a substantial dispute which necessitates \r\n    a guardian ad litem,â€ and with both of the partiesâ€™ consent.Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n    Â§ 20-7-1545 (Supp. 2003).Â  Additionally, the code provides that a guardian \r\n    must not include a recommendation concerning custody in the written report, \r\n    nor may the guardian include a recommendation at the merits hearing unless \r\n    specifically requested by the court for reasons specifically set forth in \r\n    the record.Â  S.C.

Patterson, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-156\r\nSubmitted February 9, 2004 â€“ Filed March \r\n  10, 2004Â Â Â \r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJohn William Ray, of Greenville, for Appellant\r\nPatricia W. Fuller, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Branch Banking and Trust Company \r\n  (â€œBB&amp;Tâ€) appeals an order of the Circuit Court setting aside a default judgment \r\n  against Patricia W. Fuller (Fuller).Â  We conclude the circuit court abused its \r\n  discretion in setting aside the judgment and reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn May 1994, Fuller obtained a $65,000 unsecured line of \r\n  credit from BB&amp;T.Â  Under the terms of the line of credit instrument, Fuller \r\n  was obligated to repay the balance owed under the credit line in a variable \r\n  number of monthly installments as a percentage of the balance owed BB&amp;T.\r\nBeginning around July \r\n  2001, Fuller stopped making payments on the line of credit.Â  After Fuller refused \r\n  BB&amp;Tâ€™s demands for payment, BB&amp;T commenced the present action seeking \r\n  a judgment against Fuller for the outstanding balance due on the credit line.Â  \r\n  At the time of Fullerâ€™s default, she still owed $19,381.49.Â  BB&amp;T requested \r\n  a judgment in that amount plus interest at the contract rate of 8.75 percent \r\n  dating from July 2001. \r\nOn June 17, 2002, the trial court entered \r\n  default judgment in favor of BB&amp;T for $24,196.98.Â  The trial courtâ€™s order \r\n  notes that, though BB&amp;Tâ€™s summons and complaint was personally served on \r\n  Fuller, she had failed to respond. \r\nSometime in July 2002, Fuller sent a letter \r\n  to the trial court asking that the default judgment be set aside because she \r\n  had timely served her answer prior to the judgment.Â  The letter was personally \r\n  addressed to Circuit Judge Larry R. Patterson.Â  It is stamped as having been \r\n  received by the Greenville County Clerk of Court on July 16, 2002.Â  The record, \r\n  however, contains no certificate of service indicating BB&amp;T was properly \r\n  served with a copy of Fullerâ€™s letter, nor is there any indication on the face \r\n  of the letter that Fuller attempted to provide BB&amp;T a copy of the letter \r\n  or otherwise notify it of the request made to Judge Patterson.\r\nWith no notice or opportunity to be heard, \r\n  Judge Patterson thereafter rescinded his June 17, 2002, entry of default judgment \r\n  by order filed July 16, 2002.Â  BB&amp;T claims it was not aware of the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s decision to set aside the default judgment until it received a copy \r\n  of the order on July 17, 2002.Â  In its entirety, the order setting aside judgment \r\n  reads:Â  \r\n\r\nThe Order dated June 17, 2002 \r\n  is rescinded.Â  The defendant tried to serve Plaintiffâ€™s counsel by registered \r\n  mail; however, Plaintiffâ€™s counsel refused delivery.Â  Pursuant to Rule 5, SCRCP, \r\n  service subsequent to the original summons and complaint may be served by mail \r\n  and is complete upon mailing (Citation omitted). Therefore, The Court hereby \r\n  rescinds the Order of June 17, 2002.\r\n\r\nBB&amp;T now appeals this order, arguing \r\n  inter alia, that it was not afforded an opportunity to rebut Fullerâ€™s \r\n  claim that BB&amp;T was properly served with Fullerâ€™s answer to the original \r\n  complaint. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA motion to vacate a judgment is addressed to the \r\n  sound discretion of the trial court, and itâ€™s ruling will not be reversed on \r\n  appeal absent a clear showing of abuse of that discretion.Â  Ledford v. Pennsylvania \r\n  Life Ins. Co., 267 S.C. 671, 674-75, 230 S.E.2d 900, 902 (1976); Loweâ€™s \r\n  of Georgia, Inc. v. Constantino, 288 S.C. 106, 109, 341 S.E.2d 382, 383 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1986).Â  An abuse of discretion arises when an order of a lower court \r\n  on a motion to vacate a judgment was controlled by an error of law or when the \r\n  order is without evidentiary support.Â  Ledford, 267 S.C. at 675, 230 \r\n  S.E.2d at 902.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBased on our review of the record before \r\n  us, we conclude the trial court abused its discretion in setting aside the June \r\n  17, 2002, entry of default judgment.Â  \r\n The trial court apparently \r\n  treated Fullerâ€™s July 2002 letter as a motion to set aside the judgment pursuant \r\n  to Rule 60 (b), SCRCP.Â  After default judgment has been entered, the trial court \r\n  may set aside that judgment in accordance with Rule 60(b), SCRCP.Â  Rule 55(c), \r\n  SCRCP.Â  Rule 60(b) provides that â€œ[o]n motion and upon such terms \r\n  as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from \r\n  a final judgment, order, or proceedingâ€ due to mistake, inadvertence, excusable \r\n  neglect, newly discovered evidence, fraud or other similar reasons. (emphasis \r\n  added). Notwithstanding, such a motion may not be granted without affording \r\n  an affected party the procedural due process guarantee of notice and opportunity \r\n  to be heard.Â  â€œ[I]t is fundamental that no judgment or order affecting the rights \r\n  of a party to the cause shall be made or rendered without notice to the party \r\n  whose rights are affected.â€Â  Tryron Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n v. Phelps, \r\n  307 S.C. 361, 362, 415 S.E.2d 397, 398 (1992) (citing Insurance Co. of North \r\n  America v. Hyatt, 290 S.C. 159, 348 S.E.2d 532 (1986)).Â  â€œGenerally, a person \r\n  against whom a judgment or order is taken without notice may rightly ignore \r\n  it and may assume that no court will enforce it against his person or property.â€Â  \r\n  Universal Benefits, Inc. v.

Hicks Harwell, Jr., Circuit Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-157\r\nSubmitted February 9, 2004 â€“ Filed March \r\n  10, 2004\r\n\r\nVACATED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJohn William Ray, of Greenville, for appellant.\r\nWilson L. Pickens, of Florence, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Branch Banking and Trust Company \r\n  (â€œBB&amp;Tâ€) appeals an order of the Circuit Court setting aside a default judgment \r\n  against Wilson L. Pickens (Pickens).Â  BB&amp;T contends the circuit judge lacked \r\n  jurisdiction to set aside the judgment.Â  We agree and vacate the order setting \r\n  aside the judgment.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn June 1999, Pickens obtained a loan from BB&amp;T \r\n  to purchase a used 1998 Ford Windstar van.Â  Under the terms of the loan documents, \r\n  Pickens was obligated to repay BB&amp;T (including interest and other finance \r\n  charges) $29,791.80 over 60 months.Â  As collateral for the loan, BB&amp;T held \r\n  a purchase money security interest in the van. \r\nAround August 2000, Pickens stopped making \r\n  payments on the loan.Â  BB&amp;T subsequently repossessed the van and sold it, \r\n  applying the proceeds of the sale to the amount due on the loan.Â  Because the \r\n  proceeds from the sale of the van did not cover the entire amount Pickens owed \r\n  BB&amp;T, it commenced the present action seeking a judgment against Pickens \r\n  for $12,844.37, the outstanding balance due on the loan at the time the complaint \r\n  was filed. Â BB&amp;T also requested interest and attorneyâ€™s fees. \r\nAlthough personally served with the summons \r\n  and complaint on October 10, 2001, Pickens did not enter responsive pleadings \r\n  or otherwise respond to BB&amp;Tâ€™s complaint.Â  Accordingly, on November 14, \r\n  2001, the trial court entered a default judgment against Pickens for $17,952.60 \r\n  [1]  plus post-judgment interest at the statutory rate.Â  The judgment also \r\n  allowed BB&amp;T â€œleave to foreclose or execute against Property or otherwise \r\n  enforce its judgment in any manner provided by law.â€ \r\nAccording to BB&amp;T, on or about December \r\n  17, 2001, Pickens filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition (individual liquidation).Â  \r\n  It appears from the record that, during the pendency of his bankruptcy case, \r\n  Pickens filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to avoid BB&amp;Tâ€™s â€œjudicial \r\n  lienâ€ pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Â§ 522(f).Â  The motion lists â€œbankruptâ€™s truckâ€ as \r\n  the type of property liened and â€œ1999â€ as the date of the lien.Â  The bankruptcy \r\n  judge denied Pickensâ€™ motion for failure to comply with SC LBR 9014-2 (Local \r\n  Rule) on December 21, 2001.  [2]  Â The bankruptcy court ultimately granted Pickens \r\n  a discharge in April 2002. [3] Â  \r\nOn June 14, 2002, the trial court entered \r\n  an order setting aside the November 14, 2001 judgment against Pickens.Â  According \r\n  to BB&amp;Tâ€™s brief, the trial court entered its order setting aside the judgment \r\n  sua sponte. The order states â€œ[u] pon reviewing this case it has \r\n  come to the attention of the court that defendant did file an answer to the \r\n  complaint within the time provided by the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.â€Â  \r\n  BB&amp;T objected after receipt of notice of the order.Â  The trial court then \r\n  allowed Pickens to respond.Â  By letter addressed to the trial court, Pickens \r\n  stated: â€œIn response to letter I was sent concerning my case with regards to \r\n  BB&amp;T. That debt was listed and discharg[ed] in my bankruptcy.Â  And my bankruptcy \r\n  case was discharged on April 22, 2002.â€ \r\nApparently, the trial court took no further \r\n  action to modify or amend its order setting aside judgment (nor did it expressly \r\n  decline to do so).Â  BB&amp;T now appeals the order setting aside judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n DISCUSSION\r\nBB&amp;T appeals the trial courtâ€™s order setting aside \r\n  the judgment against Pickens, arguing the lower court lacked subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction to set aside the November 14, 2001 order.Â  We agree.\r\nThe prerogative of a circuit judge to sua \r\n  sponte alter, amend, or vacate his previous judgments and orders is significantly \r\n  restricted.Â  Under the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure regarding post-trial \r\n  relief from a trial courtâ€™s orders, the trial court retains jurisdiction to \r\n  reconsider or change its previous rulings for a limited timeâ€”generally for ten \r\n  days after entry of judgment, or if upon motion of party, ten days after the \r\n  party received written notice of the order.Â  See Rule 52(b), SCRCP (providing \r\n  that motion to amend findings must be made within ten days of entry or receipt \r\n  of judgment); Rule 59(e), SCRCP (providing that a motion to alter or amend judgment \r\n  must be made within ten days of entry or receipt of judgment).\r\n This court confronted a similar question \r\n  in Ness v. Eckerd Corp., 350 S.C. 399, 566 S.E.2d 193 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\n  In Ness, the trial judge sua sponte vacated his prior order \r\n  denying the defendantâ€™s motion to set aside a default judgment. Id. at \r\n  401, 566 S.E.2d at 195.Â  On appeal, this court held the trial judge lacked jurisdiction \r\n  to vacate his previous order where the modification was not made pursuant to \r\n  a motion to alter or amend the courtâ€™s decision, but on the judgeâ€™s own initiative, \r\n  and the modification was made more than ten days after the initial order.Â  Id. \r\n  at 403, 566 S.E.2d at 195.Â  \r\nIn the present case, as in Ness, \r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s order setting aside the default judgment was entered on the \r\n  courtâ€™s own initiative, not as requested in a motion pursuant to Rule 59(e) \r\n  or other applicable rule, and well outside the ten day period generally allowed \r\n  under the rules.Â  The trial judge therefore lacked jurisdiction to set aside \r\n  his original order.\r\nAdditionally, we note that the appellant devotes \r\n  a significant portion of its argument on appeal to the putative impact on this \r\n  case of the bankruptcy proceedings involving Pickens.Â  We find this has little \r\n  bearing on our consideration of the case.Â  Although the debt emanating from \r\n  theÂ  trial courtâ€™s order of November 14, 2001 may have been discharged by the \r\n  bankruptcy court, the record before us contains no proof that has occurred.Â  \r\n  Moreover, there is no evidence in the record indicating the trial court lacked \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction to enter the original default judgment due to the \r\n  effect of the automatic stay that obtains under 11 U.S.C. Â§ 362 when a bankruptcy \r\n  petition is filed.Â  Regardless, it does not appear from the face of the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s order setting aside the original judgment that the outcome of the bankruptcy \r\n  case prompted or controlled its decision.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause the trial court lacked jurisdiction to \r\n  set aside its order of November 14, 2002, its order of June 14, 2002 is therefore \r\n  vacated.Â  The status of BB&amp;Tâ€™s debt emanating from the trial courtâ€™s order \r\n  of November 14, 2001, is a matter to be determined by the bankruptcy court.\r\nVACATED.\r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ., and CURETON, AJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  This figure includes the $12,844.37 account balance plus pre-judgment \r\n    interest of $2,673.23, attorneyâ€™s fees of $2,300, and costs of $135.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  We would note that the record reflects that BB&amp;T \r\n    exercised its lien rights prior to September 17, 2001, repossessed the van \r\n    and sold it. These actions appear to have occurred prior to the bankruptcy \r\n    filing and thus theÂ  lien avoidance motion, as it pertains to the collateral, \r\n    may have been ineffective in any event. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  The record before this Court \r\n    does not contain a listing of debts sought to be discharged, nor does it contain \r\n    documentation of the precise date Pickens filed for bankruptcy.Â  It should \r\n    be noted, however, that under 11 U.S.C. Â§ 727(b), a Chapter 7 discharge covers \r\n    all prepetition debts unless excluded under Â§ 523 of the Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-158","title":"State v.

Dudek, of Columbia, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy \r\n  Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald \r\n  J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General S. Creighton Waters, all of Columbia; and Solicitor \r\n  Donald V. Myers, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Steven Wayne Bowman appeals \r\n  his conviction for murder, claiming the trial court improperly admitted evidence \r\n  of a prior bad act.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn the early morning of October 26, \r\n  2000, Jean Holmes drove past her son Phillipâ€™s home in Edgefield County on the \r\n  way to work.Â  As she was driving, she noticed her sonâ€™s vehicle was still parked \r\n  in the driveway.Â  When she stopped to investigate, she saw what she thought \r\n  was a â€œmummy.â€Â  As she approached the body, she discovered it was her son.Â  \r\n  An investigation revealed that Phillip had been shot twice in the upper body.Â  \r\n  His body had also been partially burned.\r\nPrior to his death, Holmes had been involved in \r\n  a relationship with Debi Blankenbecker.Â  They had been dating since January \r\n  2000.\r\nBlankenbecker testified she had an affair with \r\n  Bowman several years earlier, and that Bowman became extremely jealous of her \r\n  new relationship with Holmes.Â  She claimed Bowman committed several threatening \r\n  and violent acts against her from February to October 2000.Â  For example, Blankenbecker \r\n  claimed:Â  Bowman made threatening calls demanding that she stop seeing Holmes; \r\n  Bowman â€œtrashedâ€ her house on one occasion; Bowman had attempted to â€œcarry her \r\n  away;â€ her ribs and chest were injured after a violent episode during which \r\n  Bowman washed her mouth out with soap after she spoke of Holmes; and Bowman \r\n  broke into her home at night, entered her bedroom, and demanded sex. \r\nThe crux of the present controversy \r\n  concerns Blankenbeckerâ€™s testimony regarding the incident in July 2000 in which \r\n  she claimed Bowman broke her ribs.Â  On direct examination at trial, Blankenbecker \r\n  initially described what happened that day.Â  She testified that she and Bowman \r\n  got into a fight while returning from a trip they had taken together to Atlanta, \r\n  Georgia.Â  They returned to Bowmanâ€™s house against her wishes.Â Â  She claimed \r\n  that Bowman â€œripped the phone out of the wall so I couldnâ€™t call anybody.â€Â Â  \r\n  The solicitor then asked Blankenbecker: â€œNow, while there at his home, did you \r\n  receive some injuries to your ribs?Â  Thatâ€™s all I want to know.Â  Did you receive \r\n  some injuries to your ribs?â€Â  She responded: â€œYes, I did.â€Â Â  Blankenbecker further \r\n  testified that she asked Bowman if she could call Holmes, at which point Bowman \r\n  put soap in her mouth and told her â€œnot to mention [Holmesâ€™s] name in his house.â€Â Â  \r\n  The examination regarding this event then concluded as follows:\r\n\r\nSolicitor:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  Also during this same night, was there a bruise on your chest area?\r\nBlankenbecker:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Yes.\r\nSolicitor:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  Did the Defendant tell you that you should show that bruise to anyone?\r\nBlankenbecker:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Yes.Â  \r\n  He said, â€œYou can show this to [Holmes].â€ \r\n\r\nDefense counsel did not object to any of this testimony.\r\nA few minutes later, the solicitorâ€™s \r\n  examination turned to another topic.Â  Blankenbecker was asked when she had last \r\n  heard from Bowman.Â  She responded: â€œI had not heard very much from him since \r\n  July 5th, since he broke my ribs.â€ Defense counsel immediately objected, arguing \r\n  testimony from a witness regarding a prior bad act of a defendant that is not \r\n  directly related to the deceased is not admissible and that a mistrial should \r\n  be declared.Â  The solicitor responded that the testimony was not offered to \r\n  show the character of Bowman, but rather offered to show Bowmanâ€™s malice and \r\n  animus toward the victim.Â Â  The trial court denied defense counselâ€™s request \r\n  for a mistrial, finding the probative value of the testimony outweighed any \r\n  harm that may have been done by the statement. Â Â The court then instructed the \r\n  jury that it should not consider Blankenbeckerâ€™s statement as a reflection of \r\n  the defendantâ€™s character, but only as an explanation of events that had occurred.\r\nThe State continued its case and presented \r\n  evidence in an attempt to connect Bowman to the murder.Â  The night before the \r\n  murder, Bowman borrowed his fatherâ€™s Dodge Dakota truck.Â  According to investigators, \r\n  the truckâ€™s engine was â€œvery loud.â€Â  A neighbor of Holmes testified that at \r\n  approximately 12:15 to 12:30 a.m. on October 26, 2000, he heard three gunshots.Â  \r\n  At approximately 12:55 a.m, he saw a truck driving down the road at a high \r\n  rate of speed.Â  He noted the truckâ€™s engine was so loud that it rattled the \r\n  windows.Â Â Â  \r\nTwo other neighbors of Holmes \r\n  testified that a week before the murder they saw a man, who they later identified \r\n  as Bowman, jump out of ditch and run to a car parked near Holmesâ€™s house.Â  \r\n  A map of Edgefield County found in Bowmanâ€™s car was admitted into evidence.Â  \r\n  The map had Bowmanâ€™s fingerprints on it, some of which were located right below \r\n  the area depicting the roads around Holmesâ€™s house.\r\nThe State also called Vicky Redfern \r\n  as a witness.Â  Redfern, a co-worker who had dated Bowman, testified that a week \r\n  before the murder Bowman asked to borrow her Ruger .357 pistol to practice for \r\n  a hunting trip.Â  Redfern loaned him the weapon and gave him three bullets.Â  \r\n  The night of the murder Bowman left work with Redfern. Â Â She testified \r\n  Bowman asked her to â€œcoverâ€ for him because a man named â€œPhillipâ€ had been killed \r\n  in Edgefield and he did not have an alibi.Â  He told her that Phillip \r\n  had been dating a girl that he used to date and that he and Phillip had had \r\n  â€œverbal confrontations.â€Â  According to Redfern, Bowman admitted killing \r\n  Holmes, but recanted shortly thereafter.Â Â  Redfern testified that when \r\n  she asked Bowman for her gun, he told her she could not have it because he had \r\n  used it. Â Â \r\n A security guard at Bowmanâ€™s work testified \r\n  that when Bowman walked through his security station in the early morning of \r\n  October 26, 2000, he detected the smell of burnt leaves or barbeque. Â Â An \r\n  inmate incarcerated with Bowman at the Edgefield County Jail testified Bowman \r\n  told him that he had told â€œthis girlâ€ that he had committed the murder but recanted.Â  \r\n  Bowman also said that the authorities would never find the murder weapon in \r\n  South Carolina.Â  \r\n Bowman presented several witnesses.Â  \r\n  Three witnesses, who officiated high school football with Bowman, testified \r\n  Bowman acted normally the weekend after the murder.Â  In an effort to explain \r\n  the Edgefield County map that was admitted into evidence, a friend of Bowmanâ€™s \r\n  who was a federal inmate in Edgefield County testified Bowman was planning to \r\n  visit him.Â  Additionally, a mechanic testified regarding the exhaust system \r\n  in Bowmanâ€™s fatherâ€™s truck.Â  He testified the original muffler on the truck \r\n  had not been altered.\r\nBowman testified in his own defense. \r\n  Â Although his testimony was lengthy, Bowman essentially testified he \r\n  was being sarcastic when he told Redfern that he had committed the murder.Â  \r\n  He denied committing the murder.Â Â  He explained that the night of the murder \r\n  he borrowed his fatherâ€™s truck because he thought he was going to transport \r\n  items to work for Redfern. Â Â He testified that night he went to his work \r\n  to talk with Redfern who ended her day around 10:30 p.m.Â  When he arrived around \r\n  11:25 p.m., he discovered that she was not there.Â  He then went to a nearby \r\n  Waffle House and Wal-Mart.Â  Afterwards, he drove to Redfernâ€™s house and arrived \r\n  around 12:40 a.m., but did not go in because her lights were off.Â Â  He then \r\n  decided to go back to work to get caught up.Â  He testified his previous work \r\n  week had included the 11:00 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. shift.Â  After working for \r\n  a while, Bowman left work around 2:40 a.m.Â  \r\nIn reply, the State presented an employee \r\n  where Bowman worked who testified that the night of the murder Bowman went through \r\n  security at 1:55 a.m. and logged on his computer at 2:05 a.m.Â  A SLED agent \r\n  also testified to inconsistencies in Bowmanâ€™s statements.\r\nThe jury convicted Bowman of murder.Â  \r\n  The trial court sentenced Bowman to life imprisonment without parole.Â  Bowman \r\n  appeals.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nBowman argues the \r\n  trial court erred in admitting Blankenbeckerâ€™s statement that â€œI had not heard \r\n  very much from him since July 5th, since he broke my ribs.â€Â  Specifically, Bowman \r\n  claims the probative value of this statement did not outweigh its unduly prejudicial \r\n  effect, particularly where the Stateâ€™s case was entirely circumstantial.Â  We \r\n  disagree. \r\nIn reviewing the trial courtâ€™s decision \r\n  to admit evidence of a defendantâ€™s prior bad acts, our scope of review is limited \r\n  to determining whether there is any evidence reasonably supporting the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s decisions. State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 \r\n  (2001).Â  â€œIf there is any evidence to support the admission of the bad act evidence, \r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s ruling will not be disturbed on appeal.â€ Id. (noting \r\n  in footnote that â€œ[a]lthough we have never articulated this standard of review \r\n  in the context of bad act evidence, we have in fact applied it on review of \r\n  such cases;â€ citing four previous Supreme Court decisions applying the â€œany \r\n  evidenceâ€ standard of review in cases analyzing the admissibility of prior bad \r\n  acts).\r\nAs a general rule, â€œ[e]vidence of other \r\n  crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person \r\n  in order to show action in conformity therewith.â€ Rule 404(b), SCRE; see \r\n  State v. Jenkins, 322 S.C. 414, 416, 472 S.E.2d 251, 252 (1996) (stating \r\n  evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove a defendant \r\n  committed the specific crime charged).Â  However, evidence of other crimes, wrongs, \r\n  or acts is admissible if it tends to establish motive, intent, the absence of \r\n  mistake or accident, identity, or the existence of a common scheme or plan. \r\n  Rule 404(b), SCRE; Anderson v. State, 354 S.C. 431, 435, 581 S.E.2d 834, \r\n  835-36 (2003) (â€œRule 404, SCRE, the modern expression of the Lyle rule, \r\n  excludes â€˜evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or actsâ€™ offered to â€˜prove the character \r\n  of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.â€™Â  The rule creates \r\n  an exception when the testimony is offered to show motive, identity, the existence \r\n  of a common scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or intent.â€ \r\n  (quoting Rule 404(b), SCRE)).Â  \r\nTo admit evidence of prior bad acts, there must \r\n  be a logical relevance between the acts in question and the purpose for introduction.Â  \r\n  State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 416, 118 S.E. 803, 807 (1923); State \r\n  v. King, 349 S.C. 142, 153, 561 S.E.2d 640, 645 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Even if \r\n  the prior crime evidence is relevant, it must be excluded if its probative value \r\n  is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. \r\n  Rule 403, SCRE; State v. King, 334 S.C. 504, 512, 514 S.E.2d 578, 582 \r\n  (1999).\r\nGenerally, it is improper to introduce incidents \r\n  of violence involving the defendant and someone other than the decedent. See \r\n  State v. Braxton, 343 S.C. 629, 634-36, 541 S.E.2d 833, 836 (2001) (holding \r\n  evidence of an argument between defendant and his brother the night before the \r\n  victimâ€™s murder was inadmissible character evidence); cf. State v. \r\n  Taylor, 333 S.C. 159, 168, 508 S.E.2d 870, 874 (1998) (â€œIn homicide cases, \r\n  evidence that the accused and the decedent had previous difficulty is admissible.Â  \r\n  The evidence is admissible to show the animus of the parties and to aid the \r\n  jury in deciding who was the probable aggressor.â€). \r\nThe instant case, however, is distinguishable given \r\n  the interrelationship between Bowman, Blankenbecker, and Holmes.Â  Evidence was \r\n  presented at trial demonstrating the violence Bowman inflicted on Blankenbecker \r\n  was directly related to Bowmanâ€™s envy and ill feelings toward Holmes. This evidence \r\n  is sufficient to support a finding that Bowmanâ€™s act of breaking Blankenbeckerâ€™s \r\n  ribs was part of a series of violent acts committed by Bowman, all of which \r\n  involved his hatred for Holmes.Â  Thus, the evidence was admissible to show Bowmanâ€™s \r\n  motive and animus with regard to the victim.Â  See State v. Alford, \r\n  264 S.C. 26, 32, 212 S.E.2d 252, 254 (1975) (â€œâ€˜Evidence is inadmissible to show \r\n  a difficulty between accused and a third person in no way connected with the \r\n  victim or offense . . . However, where [the] connection with the offense sufficiently \r\n  appears, evidence of prior difficulties between accused and a third person is \r\n  admissible to show malice, premeditation, or general state of mind, as is evidence \r\n  . . . that accused had a grudge against the companion of the victim at the time \r\n  of the assault.â€™â€ (quoting 40 C.J.S. Homicide Â§ 209 (pre-cursor to 41 \r\n  C.J.S. Homicide Â§ 207 (1991))); see also Mitchell v. United \r\n  States, 629 A.2d 10, 13-14 (D.C. 1993) (â€œ[W]e have also recognized that \r\n  the web of spousal discord often entangles third parties, and accordingly, have \r\n  extended the scope of the motive exception to allow evidence showing wrongful \r\n  acts against the spouse when the ultimate crime was committed against a third \r\n  party . . . [F]or admissibility determinations under the â€˜motiveâ€™ exception, \r\n  we see no reason to artificially distinguish between those situations where \r\n  the victim of the initial wrongful conduct and the ultimate crime are identical, \r\n  and where the ultimate victim is a third party with a clear nexus to the initial \r\n  misconduct.â€). [1] \r\nEven assuming the court erred in admitting \r\n  Blankenbeckerâ€™s testimony, any error in its admission was harmless.Â  As described \r\n  above, the brief statement regarding the injury to Blankenbeckerâ€™s ribs that \r\n  prompted defense counselâ€™s objection occurred after earlier, more extensive \r\n  testimony on the same incident. That testimony and the testimony of Blankenbecker \r\n  regarding numerous other violent acts directed against her was admitted without \r\n  objection.Â  Viewed in context, therefore, the statement that is the subject \r\n  of this appeal was merely cumulative.Â  Thus, its admission did not constitute \r\n  reversible error.Â  See State v. Haselden, 353 S.C. 190, 196, 577 \r\n  S.E.2d 445, 448 (2003) (stating the erroneous admission of prior bad act evidence \r\n  is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if its impact is minimal in the context \r\n  of the entire record); State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 507, 435 S.E.2d \r\n  859, 862 (1993) (finding any error in admission of evidence cumulative to other \r\n  unobjected-to evidence is harmless).\r\nAccordingly, we find the trial court \r\n  did not abuse its discretion in admitting Blankenbeckerâ€™s statement regarding \r\n  Bowmanâ€™s prior bad act.Â  Additionally, even if it had been error to admit this \r\n  testimony, the error was a harmless one, not warranting the intervention of \r\n  this Court.Â  We affirm Bowmanâ€™s murder conviction and sentence.\r\n AFFIRMED. \r\nGOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., and CURETON, \r\n  AJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â Â  To the extent Bowman argues the evidence was inadmissible because \r\n    it was too remote in time to the homicide, we find this argument is not preserved \r\n    for our review because it was not raised at trial.Â  See State v. \r\n    Byram, 326 S.C. 107, 113, 485 S.E.2d 360, 363 (1997) (stating to be preserved \r\n    for appellate review, an issue must be raised to and ruled on by the trial \r\n    judge).Â  In any event, the remoteness did not negate the relevance of the \r\n    evidence.Â  See Commonwealth v. Pacell, 497 A.2d 1375, 1378 (Pa. \r\n    Super. Ct. 1985) (finding evidence that defendant struck common-law wife five \r\n    days before the murder of wifeâ€™s paramour was relevant to defendantâ€™s motive, \r\n    and remoteness did not vitiate relevance given incident was part of the sequence \r\n    of events leading directly to the homicide). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-159","title":"Lovette c.

Okpalaeke, of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\nClifford L. Bourke, Jr., of Columbia; James M. Powell, of \r\n  Greensboro, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; Tony Lovette, Rudolph \r\n  S. Scott, Jr., and Julius Higgins (collectively, â€œAppellantsâ€) appeal an order \r\n  of the trial court granting Sonoco Products Company summary judgment in Appellantsâ€™ \r\n  wrongful termination action. We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nAppellants were each employed by Anchor Continental, \r\n  Inc. in the spiral tubing division.Â  In 1996, Sonoco bought Anchorâ€™s spiral-tubing \r\n  department.Â  Prior to the buy-out, Sonoco conducted a meeting with the employees \r\n  of this division offering them the opportunity to work for Sonoco.Â  Appellants \r\n  offered evidence that in this meeting Sonoco made several assurances concerning \r\n  employment.Â  Although the actual wording and substance of these assurances varied \r\n  slightly from worker to worker, from this evidence it appears Sonoco generally \r\n  assured the Anchor employees: [2] Â  (1)Â  No jobs would be eliminated by the buy-out;Â  \r\n  (2)Â  employees who wanted to switch to Sonoco would be granted positions and \r\n  would maintain their positions as long as they performed their work satisfactorily; \r\n  (3)Â  previous seniority would be honored;Â  (4)Â  Sonoco personnel policies would \r\n  be the same as existing Anchor personnel policies;Â  (5)Â  wages would remain \r\n  the same or increase;Â  (6)Â  all employees would maintain the same positions, \r\n  responsibilities, and hours but would be offered the choice of changing jobs \r\n  or remaining at their former jobs following any departmental restructuring;Â  \r\n  (7) former Anchor employees would be able to participate in Sonocoâ€™s retirement \r\n  pension plan after two years and their years of employment with Anchor would \r\n  be included in calculating eligibility for Sonocoâ€™s retirement pension plan;Â  \r\n  (8)Â  insurance premiums would be waived for at least three years; (9)Â  employees \r\n  could roll over their 401(k) contributions to Sonocoâ€™s plan, if desired;Â  (10)Â  \r\n  any employee who decided to stay with Anchor would be given a job in another \r\n  department with that company.Â  Eighteen of the twenty employees in the division \r\n  agreed to change to Sonoco employment, including division supervisor Scott Franklin.Â  \r\n\r\nAfter Brian Wellman became the \r\n  manager of the Sonoco division in July of 1997, he significantly restructured \r\n  the division.Â  As part of this restructuring, the pay rates for many jobs were \r\n  lowered.Â  Although no employeeâ€™s pay decreased, the employeesâ€™ pay rates were \r\n  frozen until the rates for their jobs met their current pay rates.Â  Wellman \r\n  offered Appellants new jobs under the restructuring.Â  They turned the offers \r\n  down because they felt the pay increases were not proportionate to the new responsibilities.Â  \r\n  Appellants stated that because they complained about the changes Wellman made \r\n  to the division, they were branded troublemakers.Â  \r\nIn August of 1997, Wellman began investigating \r\n  time-keeping irregularities by the employees in the department after hearing \r\n  rumors that employees were gone from the work area for long periods of time \r\n  on weekends when no members of management were around.Â  Wellman obtained the \r\n  records of the turnstile controlled by magnetic key cards through which the \r\n  employees entered the plant from the parking lot and compared them to the employeesâ€™ \r\n  time cards.Â  He found significant discrepancies in the records of eight employees, \r\n  including the three Appellants.Â  As a result of this investigation, four employees, \r\n  including Appellants, were fired.Â  \r\nAppellants initially brought an action in the U.S. \r\n  District Court for the District of South Carolina, alleging Title VII race-based \r\n  discrimination, as well as pendent state claims of wrongful breach of employment \r\n  contract and wrongful retaliatory termination in violation of state public policy.Â  \r\n  Adopting the report of an assigned magistrate, the District Court dismissed \r\n  Appellantâ€™s federal claims, but added, â€œthe remaining state law claims are hereby \r\n  dismissed without prejudice, to be pursued, if at all, in state court.â€Â  The \r\n  Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this ruling.Â  \r\nAppellants then brought an action in state court.Â  \r\n  Both parties filed motions for summary judgment.Â  The trial court granted \r\n  summary judgment in favor of Sonoco.Â  It subsequently denied Appellantsâ€™ motion \r\n  for reconsideration.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the \r\n  disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€Â  Dawkins \r\n  v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 438 (2003).Â  Summary judgment \r\n  is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the \r\n  moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Osborne v. Adams, \r\n  346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).Â  The evidence and all reasonable \r\n  inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving \r\n  party.Â  Id.Â  â€œIt is well established that summary judgment should be \r\n  granted â€˜. . . in cases in which plain, palpable and indisputable facts exist \r\n  on which reasonable minds cannot differ.â€™â€Â  Anders v. S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. \r\n  Ins. Co., 307 S.C. 371, 373, 415 S.E.2d 406, 407 (Ct. App. 1992) (quoting \r\n  Main v. Corley, 281 S.C. 525, 526, 316 S.E.2d 406, 407 (1984)); see \r\n  Bloom v. Ravoira, 339 S.C. 417, 425, 529 S.E.2d 710, 714 (2000) (finding \r\n  where a verdict is not reasonably possible under the facts presented, summary \r\n  judgment is proper).Â  \r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants argue that the promises made by \r\n  Sonoco before the buy-out constitute an oral employment contract and an exception \r\n  to the doctrine of employment at-will. We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina recognizes the doctrine of \r\n  employment at will in wrongful termination actions.Â Â  Prescott v. Farmers \r\n  Tel. Coop., Inc., 335 S.C. 330, 334, 516 S.E.2d 923, 925 (1999).Â  Although \r\n  some exceptions have been recognized, the doctrine of employment at-will remains \r\n  in South Carolina as a longstanding economic incentive that provides the marketplace \r\n  its necessary flexibility.Â  Prescott, 335 S.C. at 335, 442 S.E.2d at \r\n  925.Â  At-will employment may be terminated by either party at any time, for \r\n  any reason or for no reason at all.Â  Prescott 335 S.C. at 334, 516 S.E.2d \r\n  at 925.Â  The general rule is that termination of an at-will employee normally \r\n  does not give rise to a cause of action for breach of contract.Â  Connor v. \r\n  City of Forest Acres, 348 S.C. 454, 463, 560 S.E.2d 606, 610 (2002).Â  \r\nAn employer and employee may choose to contractually \r\n  alter the general rule of employment at-will through an oral contract of definite \r\n  employment.Â  Prescott, 335 S.C. at 335-36, 442 S.E.2d at 925-26.Â  However, \r\n  to prove the existence of such a contract, which is usually unilateral, the \r\n  employee must establish:Â  â€œ1) a specific offer, 2) communication of the offer \r\n  to the employee, and 3) performance of job duties in reliance on the offer.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 336, 442 S.E.2d at 926.Â  \r\nâ€œAn offer is the manifestation of willingness to enter \r\n  into a bargain, so made as to justify another person in understanding that his \r\n  assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude it.â€Â  Prescott, 335 \r\n  S.C. at 336, 442 S.E.2d at 926.Â  In order to be considered binding, an offer \r\n  of employment must be definite.Â  Id. at 336-37, 442 S.E.2d at 926.Â  An \r\n  offer arises from conduct from which a reasonable person in the offereeâ€™s position \r\n  would be justified in inferring a promise in return for a requested act. Â Id. \r\n  at 336, 442 S.E.2d at 926.Â  â€œVague assurances of job security, even if repeated, \r\n  do not give rise to contractual rights.â€Â  Id.\r\nIn Prescott, the supreme court found an alleged \r\n  offer of â€œ[a]s long as you do your job, keep your nose clean, that youâ€™d have \r\n  a job at [the employer] right onâ€ was not sufficiently explicit to constitute \r\n  an offer to limit termination to just cause.Â  Id. at 337, 442 S.E.2d \r\n  at 926.Â  It explained a reasonable person in the employeeâ€™s position would construe \r\n  the statement as praise or encouragement, or even â€œpuffery,â€ rather than as \r\n  an offer of definite employment.Â  Id.Â  \r\nEven when construing the alleged assurances made by \r\n  Sonoco in the light most favorable to Appellants, we find these assurances did \r\n  not satisfy the criteria set forth in Prescott.Â  Sonocoâ€™s alleged statement \r\n  to the employees that they â€œwould maintain their positions as long as they performed \r\n  their work satisfactorilyâ€ amounts to no more than a vague assurance of job \r\n  security.Â  It did not create any type of contractual rights that would remove \r\n  Appellants from the general rule of at-will employment.Â  \r\nAppellants cite Weber v. Perry for \r\n  the contention that the relinquishment of gainful employment to pursue new employment \r\n  promised by another is adequate consideration to take a position out of the \r\n  realm of at will employment. 201 S.C. 8, 21 S.E.2d 193 (1942). The controlling \r\n  distinction between Weber and the case before us is the nature of the \r\n  relinquished employment.Â  In Weber, the plaintiff abandoned his own established \r\n  business in Michigan to work for another in South Carolina.Â  While the court \r\n  did find this move adequate to establish independent consideration, subsequent \r\n  case law has distinguished these facts from circumstances where an at-will position \r\n  is relinquished to take another at-will position, even if the new employer promises \r\n  â€œlifetimeâ€ employment.Â  Orsini v. Trojan Steel Corp., 219 S.C. 272, 64 \r\n  S.E.2d 878 (1951).Â  The mere act of leaving one at-will job for another does \r\n  not take the new employment out of the general rule, notwithstanding any inducements \r\n  or promises by the later employer to the contrary.Â  \r\nThere is no evidence in the record that Appellantsâ€™ \r\n  employment with Anchor was not at-will.Â  Accordingly, their decision to leave \r\n  their at-will employment with Anchor to take positions with Sonoco did not create \r\n  any contractual rights.Â  We find no error in the trial courtâ€™s determination \r\n  that as a matter of law, Appellants were at-will employees of Sonoco and could \r\n  lawfully be terminated at any time for any or no reason.\r\nMoreover, even when assuming that Appellants were contractual \r\n  employees who could only be terminated for cause, we find the trial court correctly \r\n  held no genuine issue of material fact existed to support the Appellantsâ€™ contention \r\n  that Sonoco breached the alleged contract.Â  When an employment contract only \r\n  permits termination for cause, the appropriate test on the issue of breach focuses \r\n  on whether the employer had a â€œreasonable good faith belief that sufficient \r\n  cause existed for termination.â€Â  Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 348 \r\n  S.C. 454, 464, 560 S.E.2d 606, 611 (2002).Â  â€œ[T]he fact finder must not focus \r\n  on whether the employee actually committed misconduct;Â  instead, the focus must \r\n  be on whether the employer reasonably determined it had cause to terminate.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 464-65, 560 S.E.2d at 611.\r\nWellman testified that based on a rumor he suspected \r\n  employees had been leaving the premises without clocking out, in effect being \r\n  paid for time not spent at work.Â  It was suspected that most of these violations \r\n  had occurred over the weekends, when the plant operated without a supervisor \r\n  or manager present.Â  Employees could only enter plant from the parking lot through \r\n  a turnstile controlled by a magnetic â€œkey cardâ€. A record of the use of each \r\n  card was maintained by a computer system belonging to Anchor.Â  Wellman initiated \r\n  an investigation comparing the timecard records and the key card turnstile records \r\n  of every employee in the Sonoco division of the plant.Â  \r\nAfter comparing the records of all the hourly employees, \r\n  Wellman disregarded all timecard discrepancies he felt were insignificant, such \r\n  as times that might reflect the moving of a car, retrieving items from the parking \r\n  lot, rolling up car windows, etc.Â  He found eight employees whose discrepancies \r\n  were substantial.Â  The absences in question all took place before Wellman assumed \r\n  the position of plant manager. Wellman then approached division supervisor Scott \r\n  Franklin for any information regarding the paid absences of these eight employees.Â  \r\n  Franklin recalled satisfactory explanations for two of them.Â  Wellman then met \r\n  with the remaining six employees.Â  All six were suspended following the meeting, \r\n  but were told that a second meeting would take place later in the week and that \r\n  any information regarding the absences would be appreciated between the meetings.Â  \r\n\r\nPrior to the second meeting, two employees came to \r\n  Wellman with explanations and apologies. They each received an official warning \r\n  and were reinstated, one with pay and one without.Â  Appellants, three of the \r\n  remaining four employees, offered no further information until the second meeting. [3] Â  Following the second meeting, \r\n  Appellants were terminated.Â  \r\nAppellants argue Sonoco waived enforcement of its \r\n  rule against employees leaving the premises without clocking out by allowing \r\n  a â€œlunch runâ€ system.Â  According to the testimony of the Appellants and several \r\n  other employees, Franklin had initiated this system while supervising the Anchor \r\n  division, whereby a designated employee would leave the premises without clocking \r\n  out to purchase lunch for the entire crew or cash checks for the crew.Â  Although \r\n  this practice continued after Sonoco took over the division, it ended when Wellman \r\n  became the manager.Â  \r\nWe find no evidence in the record that Sonoco waived \r\n  its rule against employees leaving the premises without clocking out.Â  At the \r\n  most, the â€œlunch runâ€ system may have provided a viable excuse for absences \r\n  when an employee was the designated lunch runner.Â  The Appellants, however, \r\n  admitted to paid absences from work at times and for reasons that cannot be \r\n  justified by the existence of Franklinâ€™s â€œlunch runâ€ system.Â  They were given \r\n  ample opportunity to apologize or explain these absences, evidence of Sonocoâ€™s \r\n  good faith.Â  The turnstile records and Appellantsâ€™ admissions in meetings with \r\n  Brian Wellman gave Sonoco a reasonable good faith basis to terminate Appellants. [4] Â Â  \r\nAppellants also argue that they were terminated in \r\n  violation of a clear mandate of public policy. The trial court did not address \r\n  the issue of wrongful termination in violation of public policy in its order \r\n  granting summary judgment.Â  Appellants failed to seek a ruling on the issue \r\n  in their motion for reconsideration.Â  Accordingly, this issue is not preserved \r\n  for our review.Â  SeeÂ  Summer v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 43, 492 \r\n  S.E.2d 55, 58 (1997) (holding that an issue, if not ruled on, must be ruled \r\n  on by request in a post trial motion to be preserved for appeal).\r\nThe Respondent argues in its brief this court lacks \r\n  jurisdiction because Appellants failed to file their notice of appeal with this \r\n  court within ten days after they served it on Respondent as required by Rule \r\n  203(d)(2), SCACR.Â  As this court stated in its order allowing Appellants to \r\n  file their notice of appeal out of time, \r\n[I]t is the time for serving the notice of appeal that \r\n  may not be extended.Â  See Mears v. Mears, 287 S.C. 168, 337 S.E.2d \r\n  206 (1985) (timely service of the notice of appeal is jurisdictional requirement \r\n  that cannot be extended or expanded).Â  This court may allow late filing of a \r\n  notice of appeal if timely service has been accomplished for good cause shown.Â  \r\n  See Rules 203(d)(3), 231, &amp; 234(b), SCACR.&nbsp; \r\nFinding Appellants had established good cause, this \r\n  court allowed the late filing.Â  Accordingly, we reiterate this court does have \r\n  jurisdiction over Appellantsâ€™ appeal.Â  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the trial court \r\n  granting summary judgment to Sonoco is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF, HOWARD, and CURETON, J.J. concur.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n    [1]    Respondent filed a motion to strike Appellantsâ€™ \r\n    reply brief.Â  The motion is DENIED.Â  The reply brief was given such consideration \r\n    as is appropriate under appellate court procedure.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n    [2]    As mandated by this courtâ€™s scope of review, we \r\n    must view the evidence in the light most favorable to Appellants.Â  Thus, we \r\n    list these assurances in the broadest manner alleged for the purposes of this \r\n    appeal only.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n    [3]    Lovette admitted to leaving the plant to work \r\n    on a boat.Â  Scott denied leaving for long periods and claimed he often loaned \r\n    his card to others.

McIntosh, Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, \r\n  Jr.;Â  and Solicitor Warren Blair Giese, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n PER CURIAM: Richard Fletcher \r\n  was indicted for second-degree lynching.Â  Fletcher pled guilty to assault and \r\n  battery of a high and aggravated nature as a lesser-included offense of lynching \r\n  and was sentenced to five years imprisonment, suspended on the service of three \r\n  years probation.Â  Fletcher appeals, arguing the circuit court lacked subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction to accept his plea to assault and battery of a high and \r\n  aggravated nature because it is not a lesser-included offense of lynching.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nA grand jury indicted Fletcher for second-degree \r\n  lynching.Â Â Â  Subsequently, Fletcher pled guilty to assault and battery of a \r\n  high and aggravated nature (â€œABHANâ€). Â Fletcher appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFletcher argues ABHAN is not a lesser-included \r\n  offense of lynching, and thus, the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to accept his plea.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œThe lack of subject matter jurisdiction over a criminal \r\n  case can be raised at any time, can be raised for the first time on appeal, \r\n  and can be raised sua sponte by the court.â€Â  State v. Guthrie, 352 S.C. \r\n  103, 107, 572 S.E.2d 309, 311 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  A circuit court lacks subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction to accept a guilty plea unless: 1) there is an indictment \r\n  that sufficiently states the offense; 2) the defendant has waived presentment \r\n  of the indictment; or 3) the plea is to a lesser-included offense of the crime \r\n  charged in the indictment.Â  Knox v. State, 340 S.C. 81, 84, 530 S.E.2d \r\n  887, 888 (2000).Â  â€œThe test for determining when a crime is a lesser included \r\n  offense is whether the greater of the two offenses includes all the elements \r\n  of the lesser offense.â€Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nIn Knox v. State, although the defendant \r\n  was indicted for second-degree lynching, he pled guilty to ABHAN as a lesser-included \r\n  offense of second-degree lynching.Â  Our supreme court determined that because \r\n  all of the elements of ABHAN are not included in the offense of second-degree \r\n  lynching, ABHAN is not a lesser-included offense of that crime.Â  Id. \r\n  at 84-85, 530 S.E.2d at 888-889.\r\nHere, a grand jury indicted Fletcher for second-degree \r\n  lynching.Â  Subsequently, as in Knox, Fletcher pled guilty to ABHAN. Â At \r\n  the plea hearing, the circuit court accepted Fletcherâ€™s guilty plea to ABHAN \r\n  as a lesser-included offense of lynching.Â  However, â€œABHAN is not a lesser-included \r\n  offense [of lynching].â€Â  Id. at 85, 530 S.E.2d at 889.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  Fletcher did not waive presentment of an indictment for ABHAN.\r\nBecause Fletcher was not indicted for \r\n  ABHAN, he did not waive presentment of an indictment for ABHAN, and ABHAN is \r\n  not a lesser-included offense of second-degree lynching, the circuit court lacked \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction to accept Fletcherâ€™s guilty plea.Â  See Id. \r\n \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Fletcherâ€™s conviction \r\n  is\r\nVACATED.Â \r\nGOOLSBY, HOWARD and KITTREDGE, JJ., \r\n  concurring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-165","title":"State v.

Clare, Office of Appellate \r\n  Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Attorney General Deborah R. J. Shupe, all \r\n  of Columbia; and Solicitor Ralph E. Hoisington, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Jonathan West was convicted \r\n  of armed robbery, possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent \r\n  crime, and pointing a firearm. West appeals, arguing the trial court improperly \r\n  denied his motion for directed verdict.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn April 30, 2002, two men robbed the \r\n  Applebeeâ€™s restaurant in Moncks Corner, South Carolina.Â  West was immediately \r\n  identified as a suspect by the victim and two employees, but investigators were \r\n  unable to locate him.Â  West turned himself in to police three days later.Â  He \r\n  was indicted for armed robbery, possession of a firearm during the commission \r\n  of a violent crime, and pointing a firearm.Â  West was tried by a jury on September \r\n  16, 2002, and was convicted on all charges.Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWest appeals, arguing the circuit court erred in \r\n  denying his motion for directed verdict, because the State failed to present \r\n  evidence tending to prove his guilt.Â  Specifically, he argues the Stateâ€™s evidence \r\n  was insufficient, because it did not place him at the actual scene of the crime.Â  \r\n\r\nIn ruling on a motion for directed verdict, the \r\n  trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not \r\n  its weight.Â  State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998); State \r\n  v. Williams, 303 S.C. 274, 400 S.E.2d 131 (1991).Â  In reviewing the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s motion for directed verdict, the evidence must be viewed in the light \r\n  most favorable to the State, and if there is any direct or any substantial circumstantial \r\n  evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, we must find \r\n  that such issues were properly submitted to the jury.Â  State v.

Townes Jones, IV, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Annette Randolph (Appellant) was convicted of murder and \r\n  sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.Â  Randolph \r\n  argues on appeal the trial court erred (1) by denying her motion for a directed \r\n  verdict of acquittal and (2) by ruling that she waived her right to challenge \r\n  the voluntariness of her statement to law enforcement.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nOn March 3, 2001, Officer Kevin Hughes was dispatched to Appellantâ€™s home in \r\n  response to a call that an individual needed medical help.Â  Upon Hughesâ€™ \r\n  arrival, Michael Darby, the man who made the call to 911, invited him into the \r\n  home.Â  Hughes saw the decedent, Ronald Epps, lying on the couch with a small \r\n  towel over his face and a lot of blood around him.Â  Officer Hughes determined \r\n  Epps was dead and requested assistance.Â  Appellant was the only other \r\n  person present in the home and in â€œan excited state.â€Â  Officer Hughes testified \r\n  there were no signs of forced entry and no mention of an intruder.\r\n Darby testified Appellant woke him up in the morning and asked him \r\n  to wake up Epps, who she said was on the couch with a towel over his face and \r\n  blood around him.Â  While Darby was attempting to wake Epps, Appellant \r\n  pointed out a hammer on the kitchen counter and asked him to move it.Â  He refused.Â  \r\n  Recognizing that Epps needed medical attention, Darby called 911.Â  Assistance \r\n  arrived but Epps was deceased.\r\nOfficer Michael Oâ€™Connell arrived at the scene and testified \r\n  that a hammer was found in the bottom drawer next to the stove.Â  Based on information \r\n  he obtained from Officer Hughes, Officer Oâ€™Connell took the hammer first to \r\n  the morgue and later to the evidence locker.\r\nOfficer Danny Remion testified he recovered a hammer from \r\n  the home and it had rust on it.Â  Three days later, the hammer had even more \r\n  rust on it.Â  His testimony was that the rust was consistent with the hammer \r\n  having been recently washed.Â  He testified that there were traces of blood in \r\n  the shower in the master bathroom and in the sink in a second bathroom.Â  Officer \r\n  Chuck Counts testified that he tested the hammer and that it had recently been \r\n  wet.\r\nThe coroner testified Epps had been dead â€œfor several hours,â€ and \r\n  the results of the autopsy indicated that a blunt object had been used.Â  \r\n  Dr. Janice Ross performed the autopsy on the decedent and concluded that \r\n  he had been dead â€œfrom four to five hours up to twelve hours.â€Â  She testified \r\n  she had seen the hammer and could not rule out that it could have been used \r\n  to cause the blunt force injury.\r\nEppsâ€™ girlfriend, Yvette Pratt, testified that she and Epps \r\n  had driven around Newberry the night of March 2.Â  He was carrying a roll of \r\n  cash totaling at least $1200 that night.Â  At trial, Officer Eddie Salizar \r\n  confirmed Prattâ€™s testimony, adding that he had searched Epps the evening of \r\n  March 2 between 8:00 and 9:00 p.m. on Wise Street and Epps had a lot of cash \r\n  on him.\r\nAt about 11:30 p.m., Pratt dropped Epps off where he resided, a trailer owned \r\n  by Appellant and her husband, Linart Randolph (â€œLinartâ€).Â  Pratt returned \r\n  to the trailer at about 1:00 a.m.Â  Appellant and Linart were arguing, and Linart \r\n  was walking around with a hammer.Â  Pratt left the trailer.Â  She testified that \r\n  Epps was alive when she left.\r\nA witness testified that Linart was seen at a friendâ€™s house about 3:00 a.m. \r\n  smoking crack and had a roll of money on him at the time.Â  A neighbor \r\n  testified that in the morning when the police arrived in response to the 911 \r\n  call, she spoke to Appellant, who pulled out a roll of $100 bills.Â  Appellant \r\n  and Linart were subsequently arrested and charged with murder and criminal conspiracy.Â  \r\n  The trial judge directed a verdict of acquittal on the criminal conspiracy charge \r\n  for each of them.Â  However, the jury found Appellant guilty of murder.Â  \r\n  Appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Directed Verdict\r\nAppellant contends the trial judge erred in denying her motion \r\n  for a directed verdict on the murder charge because there was nothing in the \r\n  Stateâ€™s case to connect her to the murder.Â  We disagree.\r\nOn appeal from the denial of a directed verdict in a criminal \r\n  case, this Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.Â  \r\n  State v. Al-Amin, 353 S.C. 405, 411, 578 S.E.2d 32, 35 (Ct. App. 2003); \r\n  State v. Morgan, 352 S.C. 359, 364, 574 S.E.2d 203, 205 (Ct. App. 2002). \r\n  When ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned \r\n  with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight. State v. \r\n  Wilds, 355 S.C. 269, 274, 584 S.E.2d 138, 140 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  If there \r\n  is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably \r\n  tending to prove the guilt of the accused, this Court must find the case was \r\n  properly submitted to the jury.Â  State v. Harris, 351 S.C. 643, 653, \r\n  572 S.E.2d 267, 273 (2002).Â  On the other hand, if the State fails to produce \r\n  evidence of the offense charged, a defendant is entitled to a directed verdict.Â  \r\n  State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 97, 544 S.E.2d 30, 36 (2001); State \r\n  v. Padgett, 354 S.C. 268, 271, 580 S.E.2d 159, 161 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nAppellant argues the evidence only raised a suspicion of \r\n  guilt.Â  â€œSuspicionâ€ implies a belief or opinion as to the guilt based on facts \r\n  or circumstances that do not amount to proof.Â  State v. Buckmon, 347 \r\n  S.C. 316, 322, 555 S.E.2d 402, 404 (2001) (citing State v. Lollis, 343 \r\n  S.C. 580, 541 S.E.2d 254 (2001)). \r\nThe State argues there is sufficient circumstantial evidence \r\n  to submit the murder charge to the jury.Â  On March 2, 2001, Epps lived in the \r\n  home owned by Appellant and Linart.Â  A friend, Darby, lived in the home with \r\n  them.Â  When Officer Hughes, the first officer to arrive, got to the house and \r\n  found Epps dead, Appellant and Darby were the only two people there.Â  Darby \r\n  had placed the 911 call to the police.Â  According to Officer Hughes, there was \r\n  no evidence of a forced entry.\r\nEppsâ€™ girlfriend, Pratt, testified she had spent most of \r\n  the day of March 2 with him and, when she dropped him off at the house at some \r\n  point that night, he had at least $1200 on him.Â  She stopped back by \r\n  the house later that night but left when Appellant and Linart were arguing.Â  \r\n  Linart was walking around with a hammer in his hand.Â  She testified Epps was \r\n  alive when she left.Â \r\nOfficer Salizar confirmed Prattâ€™s testimony about the money, \r\n  adding that he had searched Eppsâ€™ person sometime on March 2 between 8:00 and \r\n  9:00 p.m. on Wise Street and Epps had a lot of cash.Â  A witness testified Linart \r\n  was at a friendâ€™s house at 3:00 a.m. and had a roll of money on him at that \r\n  time.Â  A neighbor testified that, after the police arrived in response \r\n  to the 911 call, she spoke to Appellant, who pulled out a roll of $100 bills.\r\nAfter Darby tried to wake Epps and got no response, he saw \r\n  a hammer on the kitchen counter.Â  Appellant asked him to move it and he refused.Â  \r\n  Officer Remion testified the hammer recovered from the home had rust on \r\n  it.Â  Over the next three days, the hammer had even more rust on it, consistent \r\n  with the hammer having been recently washed.Â  When Officer Chuck Counts tested \r\n  the hammer, he concluded that it had recently been wet.Â  Traces of blood were \r\n  found in the shower in the master bathroom and in the sink in a second bathroom.Â \r\nOfficer Michael Oâ€™Connell testified that he found a hammer \r\n  in the bottom drawer next to the stove.Â  He took the hammer first to the morgue \r\n  and later to the evidence locker.\r\n The coroner testified the decedent had been dead â€œfor several hoursâ€ \r\n  and the results of the autopsy indicated that a blunt object had been used.Â  \r\n  Dr. Janice Ross, who performed the autopsy on Epps, concluded that Epps \r\n  had been dead â€œfrom four to five hours up to twelve hoursâ€ and that she had \r\n  seen the hammer and could not rule out that it could have been used to cause \r\n  the blunt force injury.\r\nThe evidence in the instant case raised more than a mere suspicion \r\n  of guilt toward Appellant:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Appellant had access to the victim;\r\n  \r\n    there was no evidence of a break-in;\r\n  \r\n    Appellant had spent her money \r\n  on crack cocaine;\r\n  \r\n    Epps had a roll of money hours \r\n  before the murder;\r\n  \r\n    Epps did NOT have money on him \r\n  when he was found dead;\r\n  \r\n    Appellant had a roll of money \r\n  hours after the murder;\r\n  \r\n    Appellant exhibited unusual behavior \r\n  with her neighbor;\r\n  \r\n    Appellant attempted to get someone \r\n  else to touch the hammer;\r\n  \r\n    the hammer had been washed;\r\n  \r\n    Appellant immediately began to \r\n  shift the blame to her husband or the victimâ€™s girlfriend;\r\n  \r\n    Appellant attempted to mislead \r\n  law enforcement by asserting she did not know who was sleeping on her couch, \r\n  although the victim had been living with her for at least two weeks.\r\n\r\nThese facts, especially Appellantâ€™s request to Darby to move \r\n  the hammer, that the hammer had been wet, that Epps had a considerable amount \r\n  of money when he got home and Appellant had a roll of money in the morning, \r\n  constitute sufficient circumstantial evidence presented by the State to warrant \r\n  submission of the case to the jury.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Voluntariness of Appellantâ€™s \r\n  Statement\r\nAppellant argues the trial judge erred by ruling that she \r\n  waived her right to challenge the voluntariness of her statement.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt the start of the trial, the trial judge inquired \r\n  whether there were any pretrial motions, specifically, pursuant to Jackson \r\n  v. Denno. [2] Â  Appellant \r\n  answered that there were no motions.Â  The State did not introduce Appellantâ€™s \r\n  statement in their case in chief.\r\n On direct examination by trial counsel, Appellant \r\n  testified that she returned to the trailer on Friday night and â€œwent to bed \r\n  around sometime Friday morning or it could have been Friday night, over into \r\n  Friday morning.Â  I really donâ€™t know the times. . . .â€Â  Appellant testified \r\n  she had voluntarily given a statement to Officer Hughes the morning of the incident.Â  \r\n  She said she went to the police station voluntarily with Officer Hughes, read \r\n  her rights and knew â€œwhat she was doing.â€Â  She said she made the statement voluntarily.Â  \r\n  Trial counsel pointed out where Appellant had written on the third page of her \r\n  statement that she had gone to bed at 1:30 a.m., to which she responded: â€œI \r\n  was just getting nervous and really confused and stuff.Â  And so, I really donâ€™t \r\n  know.Â  It could have been 10:30, 11:30, 12:30 or 1:30.â€Â  She testified \r\n  further that she was buying crack on Wise Street somewhere between 10:25 and \r\n  10:40 p.m.Â  At another point in her testimony, Appellant said she had been in \r\n  bed at 10:30 or 10:40 p.m.\r\nWhen Appellant was questioned on cross-examination \r\n  about her statement, the following colloquy occurred:\r\n\r\n[STATE:]Â  Officer Hughes did not pressure you?\r\n[APPELLANT:]Â  He told me to write the statement.\r\n[STATE:]Â  To write the statement.\r\n[APPELLANT:]Â  He did not bother me.\r\n[STATE:]Â  Didnâ€™t bother you?\r\n[APPELLANT:]Â  No, he did not.\r\n. . . .\r\n[STATE:]Â  He didnâ€™t put any pressure on you to write this?\r\n[APPELLANT:]Â  No.\r\n\r\nAppellant testified she became confused and Officer Jackie \r\n  Swindler tried to â€œcross her up,â€ had her â€œshook up,â€ and was â€œpressing herâ€; \r\n  however, she never claimed the statement was involuntary.Â  In fact, her testimony \r\n  was that she gave the statement voluntarily.\r\n At the conclusion of cross-examination, the State \r\n  moved to introduce the statement.Â  Trial counsel objected because â€œthere is \r\n  no reason whatsoever to put it in there.â€Â  The judge sustained the objection, \r\n  but reserved the right to reverse himself.\r\nAt the close of the case, the State asked the judge \r\n  to revisit the issue of the statement being admitted into evidence.Â  The judge \r\n  admitted the statement into evidence, and trial counsel renewed his prior objection \r\n  arguing that admission of the written statement would give it more credibility \r\n  than the rest of the testimony.Â  Trial counsel was asked why a Jackson \r\n  v. Denno hearing was not requested.Â  Trial counsel responded with the argument \r\n  that nobody told him they were going to admit the statement.Â  In overruling \r\n  the objection, the judge explained that since the State did not attempt to put \r\n  the statement into evidence in their case in chief and trial counsel questioned \r\n  Appellant about it, voluntariness was waived and the State was entitled to cross-examine.\r\nThe conclusion of the trial judge as to the voluntariness \r\n  of a statement will not be disturbed unless so erroneous as to show an abuse \r\n  of discretion.Â  State v. Rochester, 301 S.C. 196, 200, 391 S.E.2d 244, \r\n  247 (1990); State v. Livingston, 223 S.C. 1, 6, 73 S.E.2d 850, 852 (1952).Â  \r\n  For the trial judge to determine whether a statement was knowingly, intelligently, \r\n  and voluntarily made, an examination of the â€œtotality of the circumstancesâ€ \r\n  surrounding the waiver must be made.Â  State v. Doby, 273 S.C. 704, 708, \r\n  258 S.E.2d 896, 900 (1979).Â  An express waiver is not necessary to support the \r\n  finding that a defendant has waived the right to counsel or the right to remain \r\n  silent.Â  North Carolina v. Butler, 441 U.S. 369, 373 (1979).\r\nTrial counsel denied the offer for a Jackson \r\n  v. Denno hearing at the start of the case.Â  The State never introduced Appellantâ€™s \r\n  statement in its case in chief.Â  The State only cross-examined Appellant on \r\n  specific issues of time after trial counsel introduced the contents of the statement \r\n  during direct examination.\r\nBased on the foregoing facts, the trial judge was \r\n  correct in finding that the statement was given voluntarily and allowing it \r\n  into evidence.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, based on the foregoing reasons, Appellantâ€™s conviction and sentence \r\n  are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., ANDERSON, and BEATTY,\r\nJJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [1]\r\n    \r\n   \r\n    We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [2]\r\n    \r\n   \r\n    Jackson v.

Martin Harvey and Pete Kulmala, both of Barnwell, for Appellants.\r\nMiles Loadholt, of Barnwell, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Appellant, the personal representative \r\n  of the Estate of Forriest Cave, brought this action against Respondents, Manly \r\n  Dunbar and Lang Dunbar, seeking to determine that certain cashierâ€™s checks and \r\n  certificates of deposit were assets of the decedentâ€™s estate.Â  The matter was \r\n  referred to a special referee, who ruled in favor of Respondents.Â  This appeal \r\n  follows.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nForriest Cave died in Barnwell County on August \r\n  26, 2001.Â  Appellant, a resident of Barnwell County, is Caveâ€™s niece, the sole \r\n  devisee in Caveâ€™s Last Will and Testament and the personal representative of \r\n  the estate.Â  Manly Dunbar and Lang Dunbar are Caveâ€™s nephews.\r\nAlthough they lived in Ohio, the Dunbars often \r\n  visited Caveâ€™s home.Â  On a visit to her home in 1999, Cave informed the Dunbars \r\n  that she had $65,000.00 in cash hidden underneath her mattress.Â  The Dunbars \r\n  told her it was not wise to keep such large amounts of cash in her home and \r\n  convinced her to put the money in certificate of deposits.Â  As a result, on \r\n  August 26, 1999, Cave put the money in two certificate of deposits with First \r\n  Citizens Bankâ€”one issued in Caveâ€™s name only, the other issued in Caveâ€™s name, \r\n  payable on death to Manly Dunbar.\r\nOn a subsequent visit in April 2000, Cave told \r\n  the Dunbars about an additional sum of cash in the house.Â  Cave converted this \r\n  cash into cashierâ€™s checks, one made payable to Cave only and two made out to \r\n  â€œForriest Cave or Manly D. Dunbar or Lang D. Dunbar, Jr.â€Â  Cave placed the cashierâ€™s \r\n  checks in a bank bag, which she gave to the Dunbars along with the bank bagâ€™s \r\n  key, asking them to take the bag with them back to Ohio.Â  Deciding it was best \r\n  to leave the bag with Cave, the Dunbars hid the bank bag in Caveâ€™s home, though \r\n  they retained possession of the bagâ€™s key.\r\nUpon Caveâ€™s request, Manly Dunbar again visited \r\n  Cave in March 2001.Â  After seeing his aunt, Manly Dunbar went to First Citizens \r\n  Bank and spoke with certain representatives of the bank.Â  As a result of the \r\n  conversation, Barbara Wright, a longtime employee of the bank and lifetime friend \r\n  of Cave, traveled to Caveâ€™s home with specific instructions from her supervisor \r\n  not to transact any business with Cave unless she was alert and in a position \r\n  to do business.Â  As per Caveâ€™s instructions, Wright assisted Cave in performing \r\n  transactions that made Manly Dunbar a joint owner of a certificate of deposit \r\n  having a face value of $16,659.83, a joint owner of Caveâ€™s checking account, \r\n  and a joint owner of Caveâ€™s safety deposit box.\r\nAppellant commenced this action on August 31, 2001 \r\n  by filing a Complaint, along with a Rule to Show Cause and Temporary Restraining \r\n  Order seeking to prohibit the Dunbars from disposing or liquidating the cashierâ€™s \r\n  checks and certificate of deposits.\r\nOn December 20, 2001, the circuit court \r\n  referred this matter to a special referee pursuant to Rule 53, SCRCP on Appellantâ€™s \r\n  motion.Â  On the accompanying form order, the circuit court left blank the line \r\n  supplied for the deadline for which the case must be heard and final order filed. \r\n  Â A hearing was held before the special referee on February 6, 2002, and an order \r\n  in favor of the Dunbars was filed on September 18, 2002.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nTimeliness of Order/ Jurisdiction\r\nFrederick asserts that the special refereeâ€™s \r\n  order should be declared void and without effect because the December 20, 2001 \r\n  Order of Reference had expired, leaving the special referee without jurisdiction \r\n  to issue the order.Â  We disagree.\r\nEffective July 1, 1985, the South Carolina \r\n  Supreme Court issued an order outlining certain procedures applicable to masters-in-equity \r\n  and referees.Â  This order included the following provisions:\r\n\r\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within sixty (60) days from the \r\n  date of filing of the Order of Reference, the Master or Referee shall hear the \r\n  referred matter.\r\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within sixty (60) days from the \r\n  date of the hearing, the Master or Referee shall make and file his report or \r\n  order with the clerk of court, unless such time shall have been extended in \r\n  writing by the Chief Judge for Administrative Purposes upon a showing of exceptional \r\n  circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe crux of Appellantâ€™s argument is that because \r\n  over seven months passed between the hearing and order in this case, the special \r\n  referee failed to comply with the supreme courtâ€™s 1985 mandate that referees \r\n  file orders within sixty days of holding a hearing on the matter.Â  Citing our \r\n  decision in Smith v. Ocean Lakes Family Campground, 315 S.C. 379, 433 \r\n  S.E.2d 909 (Ct. App. 1993), Appellant contends the failure to meet the deadline \r\n  divested the special referee of jurisdiction over the matter.\r\nAppellantâ€™s reliance on the 1985 supreme \r\n  court order to establish a timeliness requirement is misplaced because it no \r\n  longer governs the procedure for references to masters-in-equity and referees.Â  \r\n  Instead, Rule 53, SCRCP has become the controlling authority over such references \r\n  and has fully supplanted the 1985 order.\r\nIn 1986, our supreme court substantially amended \r\n  Rule 53, SCRCP.Â  Among other changes, the amended rule left scheduling of the \r\n  time and place of hearings to the referee.Â  Such a delegation of discretionary \r\n  scheduling authority cannot be concurrently reconciled with the mandatory sixty-day \r\n  time limit proscribed by the 1985 order, and as such, the amended Rule 53 must \r\n  be understood to supplant its predecessor.Â  Cf. Ramsey v. County of \r\n  McCormick, 306 S.C. 393, 397, 412 S.E.2d 408, 410 (1991) (â€œ[W]here conflicting \r\n  provisions exist, the last in point of time or order of arrangement, prevails.â€).\r\nMoreover, the 1986 amendments also made clear that \r\n  referees have the same powers as a court sitting without a jury unless the order \r\n  of reference explicitly limits the refereeâ€™s authority.Â  Rule 53, SCRCP, Notes \r\n  to the 1986 Amendments.Â  Accordingly, just as the circuit courtâ€™s order of reference \r\n  can limit the subject matter to which the refereeâ€™s authority extends, so too \r\n  can the order of reference limit the duration of that authority.Â  Such was our \r\n  holding in Ocean Lakes.Â  In that case, we ruled that a master had been \r\n  divested of jurisdiction for failing to file an order within the ninety-day \r\n  time limit the circuit court included in its order of reference.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  Unlike the order of reference in Ocean Lakes, which â€œexpired by its own \r\n  terms 90 days after the date of the order of reference,â€ the order of reference \r\n  in the instant contained no temporal limitation, no period after which it would \r\n  automatically expire.Â  See Ocean Lakes, 315 S.C. at 381, 433 S.E.2d \r\n  at 910.Â  \r\nThe rule was amended again in 1999, and as the \r\n  following notes to the amendment explain, previous procedural restrictions were \r\n  done away with:Â  \r\n\r\nThe detailed discussion of the powers of masters and special \r\n  referees, and the procedure to be followed in matters pending before them, has \r\n  been eliminated as unnecessary since the master or special referee has all the \r\n  powers that a circuit court judge sitting without a jury would have in the matter \r\n  and the procedure is that provided by the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.\r\n\r\nRule 53, SCRCP, Notes to the 1999 Amendment.\r\nAccordingly, as a corollary to our supreme \r\n  courtâ€™s adoption of Rule 53 as the exclusive controlling authority for references \r\n  to masters and referees, the 1985 order is no longer of any effect, and masters \r\n  and referees are subject to no temporal limits for order entry other than those \r\n  included in the order of reference.Â  Therefore, because the order of reference \r\n  contained no time restraint, jurisdiction remained soundly with the referee \r\n  when the order was issued on September 17, 2002.\r\nInter Vivos Gift\r\nAppellant asserts that the special referee \r\n  erred in concluding that the cashierâ€™s checks were inter vivos gifts to the \r\n  Dunbars.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œAn inter vivos gift is a contract between the \r\n  living which takes place by the mutual consent of the donor, who divests himself \r\n  of the property given in order to transmit the title to it to the donee gratuitously, \r\n  and the donee, who accepts and acquires legal title thereto.â€Â  Baptist Found. \r\n  for Christian Educ. v. Baptist Coll. at Charleston, 282 S.C. 53, 58, 317 \r\n  S.E.2d 453, 457 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  In order to establish the existence of an \r\n  inter vivos gift, there must be a donative intent to transfer the property, \r\n  a delivery by the donor, and an acceptance by the donee.Â  Worrell v. Lathan, \r\n  324 S.C. 368, 371, 478 S.E.2d 287, 288 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\nThe thrust of Appellantâ€™s contention in this case \r\n  is that the delivery element was not satisfied because Cave never relinquished \r\n  possession.Â  Although a transfer of possession is perhaps the clearest form \r\n  of delivery, it is not the only method by which delivery can be made.Â  Our supreme \r\n  court explained this in Smith v. Johnson, 223 S.C. 64, 70, 74 S.E.2d \r\n  419, 421 (1953), when it stated:\r\n\r\nIt has been settled that it is not necessary that there should \r\n  be in all cases an actual manual delivery.Â  The principle is stated thus:Â  Property \r\n  in a chattel cannot be transferred by a parol gift without delivery; but by \r\n  delivery is not meant an actual manual delivery in all cases, but any circumstances \r\n  amounting to a clear demonstration of the intention of the one to transfer, \r\n  and of the other to accept, and which puts it into his power, or gives him authority \r\n  to take possession, is all that is necessary, and is a fact that is left to \r\n  the jury.\r\n\r\nId. at 70, 74 S.E.2d at 421 (internal quotations \r\n  omitted).Â  Indeed, whenever a donor intending to make a gift â€œso acts as to \r\n  put it within the power of the donee to take possession and exercise dominion \r\n  and control, he has completed delivery, whether he actually makes a manual deliverance \r\n  of the thing itself or not.â€Â  Copeland v. Craig, 193 S.C. 484, 496, 8 \r\n  S.E.2d 858, 866 (1940).Â  \r\nApplying the forgoing to the case at bar, \r\n  when Cave bestowed the key to the bank bag upon the Dunbars, she relinquished \r\n  and the Dunbars retained much more than a small metallic object.Â  Keys are instrumentalities \r\n  of access; to deliver a key is to deliver that which is held under lock.Â  See \r\n  Jaggers v. Estes, 22 S.C.Eq. (3 Strob. Eq.) 379 (1849) (â€œBut if the key \r\n  be delivered of a desk, in which a paper or a jewel is contained, the paper \r\n  or jewel is thereby delivered; because he who has the key has the dominion of \r\n  it.â€).Â  Although the Dunbars left the bank bag hidden in Caveâ€™s residence, by \r\n  retaining the key given to them, they likewise retained the power to take possession \r\n  of the bagâ€™s contents.Â  As correctly noted by the special referee, â€œpossession \r\n  of the key gave the Dunbars sole authority to take possession of the cashierâ€™s \r\n  checks at any time they desired, as even Ms. Cave did not have access to the \r\n  checks without the key to open the locked bag.â€Â  Accordingly, because Caveâ€™s \r\n  delivery of the key satisfied the element of delivery for the cashierâ€™s checks, \r\n  the continued physical presence of the bag in Caveâ€™s residence does not render \r\n  ineffective the inter vivos gift to the Dunbars.\r\nMentally Competency\r\nLastly, Appellant contends that the special \r\n  referee erred in concluding that Cave was mentally competent when she executed \r\n  the banking transaction on March 16, 2001.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen a party challenges a transaction based on \r\n  mental incompetence, â€œthe party alleging incompetence bears the burden of proving \r\n  incapacity at the time of the transaction by a preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  \r\n  In re Thames, 344 S.C. 564, 572, 544 S.E.2d 854, 858 (Ct. App. 2001) \r\n  (internal citations omitted).Â  This Court has previously defined contractual \r\n  capacity as â€œa personâ€™s ability to understand, at the time the contract is executed, \r\n  the nature of the contract and its effect.â€Â  Id. at 570, 544 S.E.2d at \r\n  857.Â  To make this determination, we generally inquire as to whether the individual \r\n  lacked sufficient mental capacity to reasonably understand the transaction, \r\n  including the consequences and effects the transaction has upon the individualâ€™s \r\n  rights and interests.Â  Id.Â  \r\nAt trial, Appellant relied primarily on assessments \r\n  of Caveâ€™s capacity in generalâ€”including testimony that she tended to be more \r\n  alert in the afternoon than in the morningâ€”to insinuate her incapacity on the \r\n  morning of the transaction.Â  The special referee noted this deficiency by stating \r\n  that although Appellant â€œoffered several witnesses to testify about Ms. Caveâ€™s \r\n  mental state prior to and subsequent to March 16, [Appellant] offered no testimony \r\n  about Ms. Caveâ€™s mental capacity on the date these transactions occurred.â€Â  \r\n  The refereeâ€™s analysis is in keeping with the rule that the question of competency \r\n  relates only to the date of the transaction.Â  Church v. Trotter, 278 \r\n  S.C. 504, 506, 299 S.E.2d 332, 333 (1983) (â€œ[T]his Court has looked specifically \r\n  to the condition of a party at the time of a transaction.â€).Â  Respondent, on \r\n  the other hand, introduced the testimony of Ms. Wright, the bank employee under \r\n  specific instructions not to transact any business with Cave unless she was \r\n  alert and in a position to do business.Â  This was the only testimony of an unbiased \r\n  witness as to Caveâ€™s capacity at the time of the transaction.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  viewing the record in full, we find sufficient evidence to support the refereeâ€™s \r\n  conclusion that the burden of proving Caveâ€™s incapacity was unmet by Appellant.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., ANDERSON and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-188","title":"REA Construction v.

Ries and John S. Nichols, both of Columbia, for \r\n  Appellant.\r\nJames Coffas and James D. Cooper, Jr., both of Columbia, for \r\n  Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this contract case, REA \r\n  Construction Company (â€œREAâ€) sued Columbia Country Club (â€œCountry Clubâ€) for \r\n  the remaining balance due on a construction contract, plus interest and attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees.Â  The master-in-equity granted judgment to REA, finding Country Club owed \r\n  REA a total of $135,221.55.Â  Country Club appeals, arguing: 1) the contract \r\n  was ambiguous as to whether it was a unit price contract; 2) even assuming the \r\n  contract was not ambiguous, the contract was orally modified into a fixed price \r\n  contract; 3) Country Club was not bound by the portions of the contract requiring \r\n  it to pay interest on past due amounts and attorneyâ€™s fees connected with the \r\n  collection of past due amounts; and 4) REA breached the implied covenant of \r\n  good faith and fair dealing.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn 1998, Country Club solicited bids for \r\n  a construction project that entailed resurfacing a parking lot, repairing cart \r\n  paths along a golf course, and completing miscellaneous work to other areas \r\n  of its business.Â  \r\nAlthough REA faxed its proposal to Country \r\n  Club in July of 1998, Country Clubâ€™s board of directors did not approve the \r\n  project for more than a year.Â  \r\nOn August 11, 1999, Don Litchford, a member of \r\n  Country Clubâ€™s board of directors, signed the â€œProposal and Contract Formâ€ (â€œthe \r\n  contractâ€) on behalf of Country Club.Â  William Rosengarten, a commercial manager \r\n  for REA, signed the contract on REAâ€™s behalf. \r\nThe contract provided prices for various units \r\n  of work to be performed and listed $135,182.50 as the estimated price for the \r\n  total project. The contract also contained provisions authorizing REA to collect \r\n  interest on past due amounts and attorneyâ€™s fees. \r\n After the parties signed the contract, Ray Ross, \r\n  Country Clubâ€™s representative on the project, met with Tim Metz, an employee \r\n  of REA, to discuss the scope of work to be completed pursuant to the contract.Â Â  \r\n\r\nWhen the work on the project was finished, \r\n  REA sent a final bill in the amount of $208,406.94.Â  Country Club made a payment \r\n  to REA in the amount of $117,407.50, but refused to make additional payments.Â  \r\n\r\nREA commenced this action on October 11, 2000, \r\n  alleging Country Club breached the contract.Â  As damages, REA sought the difference \r\n  between the amount of the final bill and the amount paid by Country Club, as \r\n  well as interest on the outstanding balance and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Country Club \r\n  answered, denying the breach of contract claim, and counterclaimed for breach \r\n  of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligence, and unfair trade \r\n  practices pursuant to the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act. [1] Â  \r\nIn an order dated July 25, 2002, the master \r\n  found the parties entered into a valid unit price contract, and Country Club \r\n  had breached that contract by refusing to pay the invoice amount.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  REA was awarded a judgment against Country Club for $135,221.55, which consisted \r\n  of the remainder of the amount billed, plus interest and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Country \r\n  Club appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAn action to construe a contract is an \r\n  action at law.â€Â  Pruitt v. South Carolina Med. Malpractice Liab. Joint Underwriting \r\n  Assoc., 343 S.C. 335, 339, 540 S.E.2d 843, 845 (2001).Â  In an action at \r\n  law, the appellate court will correct any error of law, but it must affirm the \r\n  masterâ€™s factual findings unless there is no evidence that reasonably supports \r\n  those findings.Â  Sea Cabins on the Ocean IV Homeowners Assâ€™n v. City of N. \r\n  Myrtle Beach, 337 S.C. 380, 388, 523 S.E.2d 193, 197 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Ambiguous \r\n  Contract\r\nCountry Club argues the master erred by finding \r\n  the contract was not ambiguous as to whether it was a unit price contract.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nIf a contract is clear on its face and reasonably \r\n  susceptible to only one interpretation, it is not ambiguous.Â  Padgett v. \r\n  South Carolina Ins. Reserve Fund, 340 S.C. 250, 254, 531 S.E.2d 305, 307 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Conversely, â€œ[a] contract is ambiguous when the terms of the \r\n  contract are reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation.â€Â  South \r\n  Carolina Dept. of Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, \r\n  623, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302 (2001).Â  When the language of the contract is ambiguous, \r\n  parol evidence is allowed to determine the intent of the parties.Â  Southern \r\n  Atlantic Fin. Servs. v. Middleton, 349 S.C. 77, 81, 562 S.E.2d 482, 484-85 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nThe determination of whether the language of a \r\n  contract is ambiguous is a question of law.Â  McClellanville, 345 S.C. \r\n  at 623, 550 S.E.2d at 302-03.\r\n Initially, we note, Country Club does not deny \r\n  the contract is clear on its face.Â  The front page of the contract stated the \r\n  price was â€œestimatedâ€ and the contract was â€œa unit price contract.â€ \r\nInstead, Country Club argues these two terms, estimated \r\n  and unit price contract, each have more than one reasonable meaning, rendering \r\n  the contract ambiguous.Â  Specifically, Country Club argues these words in the \r\n  contract could mean REA was only allowed to charge the estimated amount, and \r\n  any additional work authorized by Country Club would be billed at a unit price.Â  \r\n  The master disagreed with this argument, as do we.\r\nThe meaning proposed by Country Club for the term \r\n  estimated would render the term meaningless.Â  Further, nothing in the contract \r\n  required REA to seek Country Clubâ€™s approval to exceed the estimated total listed \r\n  on the front page of the contract.Â  \r\nAdditionally, as to the term unit price contract, \r\n  the attachment to the contract outlined estimated expenditures.Â  For each type \r\n  of work to be performed, a subsection provided the price per unit, the estimated \r\n  number of units to be used, and the estimated total price for that subsection. [2] Â  A statement on the front page of the contract instructed measurements \r\n  to be taken to determine the total amount to charge for the work performed pursuant \r\n  to the contract.Â  Further, the contract contained no language suggesting the \r\n  estimated number of units could only be increased if Country Club authorized \r\n  additional work.\r\nWe conclude the master correctly held the contract \r\n  was not ambiguous.Â  Therefore, the master did not err in deciding the contract \r\n  was a unit price contract. [3] Â  Id. at 623, 550 S.E.2d at 302-03 (â€œIt \r\n  is a question of law for the court whether the language of a contract is ambiguous.â€).\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Oral Modification\r\nCountry Club argues even assuming the contract originally \r\n  was a unit price contract, the master erred by failing to find the contract \r\n  was orally modified into a fixed price contract.Â  We disagree.\r\nAfter the contract was signed, Ross, Country Clubâ€™s \r\n  representative on the project, and Metz, an employee of REA, discussed modifications \r\n  to the contract.Â  Ross testified Country Club wanted to increase the size of \r\n  a parking lot, as well as add parking-lot islands and several man-hole covers.Â  \r\n  He also testified Country Club had decided against installing several cart paths.Â  \r\n  According to Ross, these changes would result in a total cost of $121,000.00 \r\n  for the project.Â  Ross testified Metz agreed with Ross that the price of the \r\n  project was to remain within Country Clubâ€™s $121,000.00 budget.Â  Based on this \r\n  conversation between Ross and Metz, Country Club argues the unit price contract \r\n  was modified into a fixed price contract.\r\nGenerally, a written contract may be orally \r\n  modified.Â  Roberts v. Gaskins, 327 S.C. 478, 483, 486 S.E.2d 771, 773 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œAny modification of a written contract must satisfy all requisites \r\n  of a valid contract.â€Â  Player v. Chandler, 299 S.C. 101, 104, 382 S.E.2d \r\n  891, 893 (1989).Â  However, a person who enters into a contract on behalf of \r\n  a company must have authority to do so for the contract to be valid.Â  Pee \r\n  Dee Nursing Home v. Florence Gen. Hosp., 309 S.C. 80, 81-85, 419 S.E.2d \r\n  834, 835-37 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  \r\nThe master found no evidence to suggest Metz had \r\n  the authority to negotiate contracts on behalf of REA and concluded these discussions \r\n  between Ross and Metz did not result in a valid contract modification. \r\nThe record supports this conclusion.Â  Ross testified \r\n  he assumed Metz was the project manager for REA, but that Metz did not make \r\n  such a representation.Â  Ross also testified he, not REA, had given Metz a copy \r\n  of the contract. \r\nBecause the evidence supports the masterâ€™s conclusion \r\n  that there was no modification of the written contract, we hold the master did \r\n  not abuse its discretion.Â  \r\nCountry Club also contends \r\n  that because the testimony of Litchford and Ross as to the modification was \r\n  not contradicted by REA, the master erred by failing to rule the contract had \r\n  been modified.Â  However, the trier of fact is not required to accept uncontradicted \r\n  testimony as true.Â  Black v. Hodge, 306 S.C. 196, 198, 410 S.E.2d 595, \r\n  596 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  Therefore, the master did not err by ruling against Country \r\n  Club on this issue.Â Â  \r\nIII. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  Contract Provisions Concerning Interest and Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nCountry Club argues there is no evidence in the record \r\n  from which the master could have concluded Country Club agreed to be bound by \r\n  the portions of the contract requiring it to pay interest on past due amounts \r\n  and attorneyâ€™s fees connected with the collection of past due amounts.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA person signing a document is responsible for reading \r\n  the document and making sure of its contents. Every contracting party owes a \r\n  duty to the other party to the contract and to the public to learn the contents \r\n  of a document before he signs it.â€Â  Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. \r\n  648, 663, 582 S.E.2d 432, 440 (Ct. App. 2003); see Munoz v. Green \r\n  Tree Fin. Corp., 343 S.C. 531, 541, 542 S.E.2d 360, 365 (2001) (â€œ[A] person \r\n  who can read is bound to read an agreement before signing it.â€).Â  \r\nAlthough Litchford admits signing the contract \r\n  on behalf of Country Club, Litchford testified that he did not read the â€œGeneral \r\n  Terms and Conditionsâ€ section, the section relating to interest and attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees.Â  Because Litchford failed to read this section of the contract, Country \r\n  Club argues it should not be required to pay interest or attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nLitchfordâ€™s signature is located on the front page \r\n  of the contract.Â  Above Litchfordâ€™s signature, there is a provision that states \r\n  â€œ[REA] propose[s] to furnish all the necessary supervision, labor, equipment \r\n  and materials required to complete the following work as outlined below, subject \r\n  to terms and conditions stated below and on reverse side hereof and incorporated \r\n  as part of this proposal.â€ (emphasis added).Â  \r\nThe â€œGeneral Terms and Conditionsâ€ section is located \r\n  on the back of the first page of the contract.Â  One of its subsections authorizes \r\n  REA to collect interest on past due accounts, while another subsection allows \r\n  REA to recoup attorneyâ€™s fees related to the collection of past due amounts.Â  \r\n\r\nBecause Litchford acknowledged \r\n  signing the contract, the master did not err by concluding Country Club was \r\n  bound by the â€œGeneral Terms &amp; Conditionsâ€ section of the contract.Â  \r\nCountry Club also argues \r\n  the â€œGeneral Terms &amp; Conditionsâ€ section of the contract was not conspicuous, \r\n  and as such, Country Club should not be bound by it.Â  To support this proposition, \r\n  Country Club relies on Kumpf v. United Tel. Co. of Carolinas, 311 S.C. \r\n  533, 429 S.E.2d 869 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\nIn Kumpf, this court \r\n  was confronted with the task of determining whether a contract disclaimer in \r\n  an employee handbook was sufficiently conspicuous to assure the promises in \r\n  the handbook were nonbinding.Â  Id. at 537, 429 S.E.2d at 872.Â  To assist \r\n  in its determination, this Court looked to the South Carolina Uniform Commercial \r\n  Code (â€œUCCâ€) for guidance as to the definition of conspicuous.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\n\r\nIn Kumpf, we did \r\n  not hold all contract provisions must be conspicuous, and we decline to do so \r\n  now.Â  Further, because Kumpf does not discuss contract provisions concerning \r\n  interest or attorneyâ€™s fees, and we have found no South Carolina cases specifically \r\n  requiring contract provisions regarding interest or attorneyâ€™s fees to be conspicuous, \r\n  we hold there is no requirement that these provisions be conspicuous.Â  Thus, \r\n  Country Clubâ€™s argument is without merit.\r\nIV.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Implied Covenant of Good Faith and \r\n  Fair Dealing\r\nCountry Club argues REAâ€™s \r\n  failure to obtain approval before increasing the price of the project was a \r\n  breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œ[T]here exists in every \r\n  contract an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.â€Â  Commercial \r\n  Credit Corp. v. Nelson Motors, 247 S.C. 360, 367, 147 S.E.2d 481, 484 (1966).Â  \r\n  â€œHowever, there is no breach of an implied covenant of good faith where a party \r\n  to a contract has done what provisions of the contract expressly gave him the \r\n  right to do.â€Â  Adams v. G.J. Creel &amp; Sons, 320 S.C. 274, 277, 465 \r\n  S.E.2d 84, 85 (1995). \r\nBecause we have concluded \r\n  the master was correct in finding the parties entered into an unambiguous unit \r\n  price contract and Country Club was bound by it, there is no evidence to support \r\n  bad faith on the part of REA.Â  \r\nThe attachment to the contract \r\n  outlined estimated expenditures.Â  For each type of work to be performed, a subsection \r\n  provided the price per unit, the estimated number of units to be used, and the \r\n  estimated total price for that subsection.Â  Both the number of units and the \r\n  total price for the subsection were labeled as estimates.Â  Although REA increased \r\n  the number of units used in the project and this increase in units was reflected \r\n  in the final bill, the unit price did not increase.Â  Because only estimated \r\n  terms increased, REA performed according to the contract.Â  Therefore, the master \r\n  did not err by finding that REA did not breach the implied covenant of good \r\n  faith and fair dealing.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing \r\n  reasons, the masterâ€™s decisions are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HOWARD, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concurring.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The master found Country Club failed to prove its claims for negligence \r\n    and unfair trade practices.Â  These rulings are not appealed.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Under the heading â€œResurfacing Lot and Related Work,â€ for example, \r\n    the price for the parking lot resurfacing was shown as â€œ$36.00 per ton. We \r\n    estimated 12.070 square yards.Â  This yields approximately 1,000 \r\n    tons.Â  Subtotal estimated price = $36,000.00.â€Â  Â (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Country Club further argues both parties intended a fixed price contract, \r\n    and thus, the contract should be reformed.Â  Because Rosengarten signed the \r\n    contract on behalf of REA, and Rosengarten testified REA intended to create \r\n    a unit price contract, there is evidence that reasonably supports the masterâ€™s \r\n    implicit decision that there was no mutual mistake as to the type of contract \r\n    entered into by the parties.Â  See Crosby v. Protective Life Ins. \r\n    Co., 293 S.C. 203, 206, 359 S.E.2d 298, 300 (Ct.

Warner, of Columbia; for Appellant\r\nElizabeth Van Doren Gray and Laura W. Robinson, both of Columbia; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Appellant Laura T. Tyler commenced \r\n  this action by filing a Summons and Petition seeking, among other things, to \r\n  have Respondent Mary Gail T. Salley removed as the personal representative for \r\n  the estate of Hal Barr Tyler and to have a substitute personal representative \r\n  appointed.Â  The trial court denied all requested relief. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nOn December 10, 1997, Hal Barr Tyler died \r\n  of cancer.Â  Unable to locate her husbandâ€™s will, Laura Tyler hired an attorney \r\n  and filed an intestate estate with the Probate Court for Richland County.Â  Halâ€™s \r\n  will was eventually recovered, and in accordance with its terms, Halâ€™s sister \r\n  Mary Gail T. Salley was appointed personal representative of the estate on January \r\n  26, 1998.\r\nWhen Salley learned that she was the named \r\n  personal representative, she hired Elaine H. Fowler, an attorney who practices \r\n  in the area of probate administration, to represent and advise her in connection \r\n  with the performance of her duties and responsibilities as personal representative.Â  \r\n  According to the testimony offered at trial, Salley did not take any action \r\n  as personal representative without express guidance and direction from Fowler.\r\nUnder the will, Salley was to receive \r\n  a one-half interest in farmland located in Orangeburg, South Carolina; Halâ€™s \r\n  inherited interest in certain personal property; the proceeds from a $51,000 \r\n  life insurance policy; and a $50,000 specific bequest.Â  The residuary was left \r\n  to Tyler and included SCANA stock, a duplex on Brennen Road, and other personal \r\n  property.Â  \r\nDuring his lifetime, Hal took out a loan \r\n  against the proceeds of a $10,000.00 life insurance policy of which Salley was \r\n  the beneficiary.Â  After receiving the remaining proceeds of the policy after \r\n  Halâ€™s death, upon the advice of Fowler, Salley took out $4,214 from the estate.Â  \r\n  This represented the difference between the initial policy amount and the reduced \r\n  value of the policy.Â  When Fowler realized her advice was mistaken, she instructed \r\n  Salley to reimburse the estate.Â  Salley then repaid the estate with interest.\r\nOn July 1, 1999, Tyler filed a Summons \r\n  and Petition in the Probate Court, seeking to have Salley removed as personal \r\n  representative and to have a substitute personal representative appointed.Â  \r\n  She sought to disgorge all attorneyâ€™s fees paid to Fowler and all commissions \r\n  paid to Salley.Â  The trial court denied Tylerâ€™s requested relief.Â  This appeal \r\n  follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA request to remove a personal representative seeks \r\n  affirmative relief that lies in equity.Â  Dean v. Kilgore, 313 S.C. 257, \r\n  437 S.E.2d 154 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  As such, we may make findings according to \r\n  our own view of the preponderance of the evidence, though we need not disregard \r\n  the findings of the trial judge who saw and heard the witnesses and was in a \r\n  better position to judge their credibility.Â  In re Thames, 344 S.C. 564, \r\n  571, 544 S.E.2d 856, 857 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nRemoval\r\nTyler contends that the trial court erred \r\n  in not removing Salley as personal representative.Â  We disagree.\r\nAlthough the appointment of a personal representative \r\n  â€œis not lightly to be set aside,â€ the Probate Code provides that anyone â€œinterested \r\n  in the estate may petition for removal of a personal representative for cause \r\n  at any time.â€Â  See Witherspoon v. Watts, 18 S.C. 396, 422 (1883); \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-611(a) (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\n\r\nCause for removal exists when removal would be in the best \r\n  interests of the estate, or if it is shown that a personal representative or \r\n  the person seeking his appointment intentionally misrepresented material facts \r\n  in the proceedings leading to his appointment, or that the personal representative \r\n  has disregarded an order of the court, has become incapable of discharging the \r\n  duties of his office, or has mismanaged the estate or failed to perform any \r\n  duty pertaining to the office.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-611(b) (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\nTylerâ€™s numerous complaints can be summarized into \r\n  two general categorical allegations:Â  (1) Salley was late in performing her \r\n  obligations; and (2) she engaged in self-dealing.Â  \r\nIn support of her contention that Salley \r\n  was excessively dilatory in administering the estate, Tyler notes that Salley \r\n  did not file the estateâ€™s inventory until more than a year after it was initially \r\n  due and did not file the Form 706 estate tax return until almost a year after \r\n  the initial due date.Â  In both cases, however, Salley received deadline extensions \r\n  from the relevant authority.Â  Moreover, evidence presented at trial indicates \r\n  that Tyler at least shared the blame with Salley for any unnecessary delays.Â  \r\n  Tyler and her counsel engaged Salley and Fowler in lengthy discussions concerning \r\n  what property was to be included in the estate and how much it was worth, and \r\n  Tylerâ€™s indecisiveness on the elective share issue only acted to forestall finality.Â  \r\n  In any event, the rather modest delays in this case have not so jeopardized \r\n  the best interest of the estate as to warrant removing the personal representative.\r\nWe find Tylerâ€™s allegations of self-dealing to \r\n  be unfounded.Â  Although Salley did improperly remove $4,214 from the estate \r\n  to repay a loan Hal had taken against a life insurance policy, she did so at \r\n  the advice of the estateâ€™s attorney.Â  When Salley realized there had been a \r\n  mistake about the propriety of the transaction, she reimbursed the estate with \r\n  interest.Â  Nonetheless, Tyler asserts that the absence of the funds from the \r\n  estate caused a cash shortfall, precluding Salley from making necessary repairs \r\n  to the duplex on Brennen Road and forcing her to sell the SCANA stocks for too \r\n  low of a price.Â  \r\nContrary to Tylerâ€™s contention, Salley did not \r\n  fail to make necessary repairs to the Brennen Road duplex for want of estate \r\n  funds.Â  Quite the opposite, at a cost of $3,500, [2]  Salley arranged to have the roof of the duplex \r\n  repaired to prevent damage from leakage.Â  The only repairs she forwent were \r\n  those she deemed to be cosmetic in nature.Â  Indeed, even without the cosmetic \r\n  repairs, tenants regularly occupied the duplex during the estateâ€™s administration, \r\n  thereby generating rental income for the estate. \r\nWe find most remarkable Tylerâ€™s contention that \r\n  Salley wasted estate assets by selling the SCANA stocks too early:Â  \r\n\r\nMrs. Salley also admitted that, because the estate needed \r\n  money to pay its lawyers, she sold SCANA stock at $27.00 per share when, if \r\n  she had made one phone call or kept up with this investment in the newspaper, \r\n  she would have learned that had she waited six weeks, the stock could have been \r\n  sold for $30.00 per share.\r\n\r\nThough the role of personal representative comes \r\n  with many responsibilities, stock market clairvoyance is certainly not one of \r\n  them.Â  A personal representative does not waste estate assets when she fails \r\n  to anticipate fluctuation in the value of securities.\r\nWe see no error committed by the trial \r\n  judge, who after considering the testimony of Salley, Tyler, and the estate \r\n  attorney, determined that Salley had not failed to perform any duty as personal \r\n  representative, engaged in willful misconduct, or improperly disposed of estate \r\n  assets.Â  Accordingly, we conclude the trial court did not err in refusing to \r\n  remove Salley as personal representative.\r\nDisgorgement\r\nTyler contends that the trial court erred \r\n  in refusing to disgorge attorneyâ€™s fees paid to the attorney hired by Salley \r\n  to assist her in her role as personal representative.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina law specifically authorizes and \r\n  empowers personal representatives to hire attorneys, accountants, and advisors \r\n  to perform or assist in the performance of the personal representativeâ€™s duties.Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-715(19) (1987).Â  The personal representative is likewise \r\n  authorized to hire counsel when an estate brings or defends a lawsuit.Â  S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-715(20) (1987).Â  Section 62-3-720 specifically makes the estate \r\n  responsible for the resulting attorneyâ€™s fees:\r\n\r\nIf any personal representative or person nominated as personal \r\n  representative defends or prosecutes any proceeding in good faith, whether successful \r\n  or not, he is entitled to receive from the estate his necessary expenses and \r\n  disbursements including reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees incurred.\r\n\r\nThe attorney hired by Salley charged $150.00 \r\n  per hour, and prior to the litigation commenced by Tyler, Salley had spent only \r\n  $8,342.05 in attorneyâ€™s fees on a $200,000.00 estate.Â  We agree with the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s determination that the fees paid by Salley were not excessive and find \r\n  ample evidence in the record to support that finding. \r\n  [3] \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., ANDERSON and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  The Record on Appeal erroneously refers to $35,000.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Â  We likewise dismiss Tylerâ€™s claim that the trial court should have \r\n    allowed her to recover fees paid to Salley as personal representative or against \r\n    Salleyâ€™s beneficial interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-190","title":"Smith v.

Warren \r\n  Brown, as personal representatives of the Estate of Christopher Bernard Smith \r\n  (â€œthe Estateâ€), commenced this wrongful death action against the South Carolina \r\n  Department of Transportation (â€œSCDOTâ€) and William P. Cannington.Â  In this appeal, \r\n  the Estate argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Cannington \r\n  and in finding insufficient evidence existed for the submission of a conscious \r\n  pain and suffering claim against Cannington.Â  We affirm. [1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThis case arose out of an automobile \r\n  accident, which occurred on November 10, 1997.Â  Christopher Bernard Smith (â€œthe \r\n  Decedentâ€) drove a tractor-trailer from Jasper County, South Carolina to Augusta, \r\n  Georgia where he picked up a load of fertilizer.Â  As he was returning to Ridgeland, \r\n  South Carolina along Highway 278 in Aiken County, he encountered a detour, which \r\n  routed him off Highway 278 and onto a series of secondary roads.Â Â Â  \r\nSCDOT created the detour due to construction on \r\n  the closed portion of Highway 278.Â  The detour eventually led travelers to DeSoto \r\n  Road, which intersects back into Highway 278 at a T-type intersection.Â  Travelers \r\n  on DeSoto Road encountered a steep downgrade for a short distance prior to the \r\n  intersection with Highway 278.Â  For unknown reasons, the Decedent failed to \r\n  stop when he reached the intersection, and as he turned the tractor-trailer \r\n  to the right and onto the highway, it overturned resulting in his death.Â  \r\nFollowing the accident, the Estate commenced wrongful \r\n  death and conscious pain and suffering actions against SCDOT and William P. \r\n  Cannington.Â  The Estate alleged SCDOT was negligent in several particulars related \r\n  to the detour.Â  For example, the Estate averred SCDOT was negligent in its failure \r\n  to erect proper signs warning travelers of the T-type intersection at DeSoto \r\n  Road and Highway 278.Â Â  \r\nAs to Cannington, the owner of the tractor-trailer \r\n  the Decedent was operating at the time of the accident, the Estate alleged inter \r\n  alia that he was negligent in failing to provide a vehicle in suitable \r\n  mechanical condition, and that this failure caused or contributed to the Decedentâ€™s \r\n  death.Â  \r\nOn April 26, 2001, SCDOT moved for summary judgment \r\n  on the Estateâ€™s cause of action for conscious pain and suffering.Â  On May 22, \r\n  2002, the trial court issued an order granting SCDOTâ€™s motion, stating that \r\n  no issue of material fact existed which would establish that the Decedent was \r\n  conscious prior to his death.Â  Following the grant of summary judgment, the \r\n  Estate and SCDOT reached a settlement, and thus, SCDOT is no longer a party \r\n  to this action.Â  \r\nCannington moved for complete summary \r\n  judgment on April 4, 2002, arguing no evidence rising beyond mere speculation \r\n  was presented that the vehicle was in an unsafe condition.Â  On June 18, 2002, \r\n  the trial court granted Canningtonâ€™s motion.Â  The Estate filed motions to alter \r\n  or amend; those motions were denied by order dated August 16, 2002.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Estate argues the trial court erred \r\n  in granting summary judgment to Cannington.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, \r\n  this Court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule \r\n  56(c), SCRCP.â€Â  Fisher v. Stevens, 355 S.C. 290, 294, 584 S.E.2d 149, \r\n  151 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing Baughman v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 \r\n  S.C. 101, 410 S.E.2d 537 (1991)). Accordingly, summary judgment is appropriate \r\n  when â€œâ€˜there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the moving \r\n  party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting Rule \r\n  56(c), SCRCP).Â  â€œIn determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, as \r\n  will preclude summary judgment, the evidence and all inferences which can be \r\n  reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the \r\n  nonmoving party.â€Â  McNair v. Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, 341, 499 S.E.2d \r\n  488, 493 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nThus, an issue must be submitted to a \r\n  jury when material evidence exists tending to establish the point in the minds \r\n  of reasonable jurors.Â  Hurd v. Williamsburg County, 353 S.C. 596, 609, \r\n  579 S.E.2d 136, 142-143 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  However, this does not mean an issue \r\n  must be presented to a jury if the presentation rests on â€œspeculative, theoretical \r\n  and hypotheticalâ€ views.Â  Id.Â  This is part and parcel of the firmly \r\n  established rule that â€œverdicts may not be permitted to rest upon surmise, conjecture \r\n  or speculation.â€Â  Small v. Pioneer Machinery, Inc., 329 S.C. 448, 461, \r\n  494 S.E.2d 835, 841 (Ct. App. 1997); see also Hanahan v. Simpson, \r\n  326 S.C. 140, 149, 485 S.E.2d 903, 908 (1997). \r\n  [2] \r\nThe Estate points to eleven specific factors \r\n  the trial court failed to consider when granting Canningtonâ€™s summary judgment \r\n  motion.Â  However, only three of the eleven are even arguably relevant in making \r\n  the determination of whether something was wrong with Canningtonâ€™s vehicle.Â  \r\n  The Estate mentions the presence of skid marks showing the Decedentâ€™s attempt \r\n  to make the turn, the speed at which the Decedent was attempting to make the \r\n  turn, and the fact that the brakes on the right side of the trailer â€œshould \r\n  have loaded if, in fact, they were working.â€Â  The Estate also points out that \r\n  the trial court failed to mention that the vehicle had brake problems.Â  \r\nAlthough it is true the trial court did \r\n  not specifically state that the vehicle had previous brake problems, the court \r\n  does acknowledge that the vehicle passed the required safety inspection within \r\n  one year of the accident.Â  The trial court also noted that preventive maintenance \r\n  had been performed on the vehicleâ€™s braking system in the weeks prior to the \r\n  accident.Â  In addition, Lonnie Grant, the mechanic who performed the maintenance \r\n  on the vehicle, testified he drove the truck the week he worked on it and that \r\n  it â€œ[drove] good.â€Â  It is also important to note, as the trial court did, that \r\n  the only person who inspected the actual vehicle, Officer Richard Todd Sawyer \r\n  of the South Carolina State Transport Police, testified that his visual inspection \r\n  of the vehicle produced no evidence from which it might be inferred that the \r\n  brakes were not working properly.Â  \r\nThe Estate points to the deposition testimony \r\n  of two accident reconstruction experts, Joe Wade Kent and Ronald Kirk, to support \r\n  its contention that something was wrong with the vehicleâ€™s brakes.Â  However, \r\n  neither of these experts states with any reasonable degree of certainty that \r\n  the brakes were inoperable or contributed to causing the accident.Â  In fact, \r\n  Kent testified that â€œone of the possibilities and fairly likely probabilit[ies] \r\n  is that during the time the driver was trying to make this right turn he was \r\n  not on the brakes, that he was just trying to make the turn.â€Â  His point was \r\n  not that the brakes were never applied, but that no physical evidence of braking \r\n  existed.Â  When specifically asked whether he could say with a reasonable degree \r\n  of â€œengineering certaintyâ€ that the brakes had anything to do with the accident, \r\n  Kent replied as follows: â€œI donâ€™t think I could really state it anymore explicitly \r\n  than I already have.Â  There are [three] possible causes, and it could be any \r\n  one or any combination to [sic] any percentage of those [three].â€Â  \r\nSimilarly, Kirk testified that he could \r\n  not state â€œto a reasonable degree of engineering certainty that there was anything \r\n  wrong with the truck brakes.â€Â  When asked whether he had formed any opinions \r\n  within a reasonable degree of certainty as to the cause of the accident, Kirk \r\n  stated: â€œWhat led to [the accident], I donâ€™t know.Â  Whether it was a braking \r\n  deficiency, whether its inattention, some combination, whether he didnâ€™t see \r\n  the stop sign soon enough, I just donâ€™t know.Â  Or whether some third vehicle \r\n  may have been somehow responsible.Â  I just donâ€™t know all that.â€Â  \r\nThus, because no evidence existed which \r\n  rose beyond conjecture or speculation that the brakes on the vehicle were defective, \r\n  we find the trial court did not err in granting Cannington summary judgment. [3] Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor \r\n  of Cannington is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., ANDERSON and BEATTY,\r\nJJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [1]    We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [2]    The Estate appears to argue that the adoption of comparative negligence \r\n    has somehow changed the standard for the grant or denial of a motion for summary \r\n    judgment.Â  As is apparent by the cases relied on in the preceding paragraph, \r\n    however, this argument is without merit.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [3]    Because we find the trial court did not err in \r\n    granting Canningtonâ€™s motion for complete summary judgment, we need not address \r\n    the Estateâ€™s argument regarding the Decedentâ€™s conscious pain and suffering.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-191","title":"Vatrick v.

Gregory, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-191\r\nSubmitted March 8, 2004 â€“ Filed March \r\n  22, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nReese I. Joye and J. Craig Smith, of N. Charleston; Stephen \r\n  L. Brown, of Charleston; for Appellant.\r\nAndrea St. Amand and Richard A. Farrier, Jr., of Charleston; \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Melva Vatick \r\n  filed a negligence suit against South Carolina Federal Credit Union for damages \r\n  incurred when she fell after using Credit Unionâ€™s automatic teller machine.Â  \r\n  At the close of Vatickâ€™s case, the trial court granted Credit Unionâ€™s motion \r\n  for a directed verdict.Â  Vatick appeals.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nVatick, a customer of Credit \r\n  Union, routinely used its automatic teller machine (ATM).Â  Vatick testified \r\n  that she always parked her car in front of the building and walked to the ATM, \r\n  which included climbing one step from the pathway to the ATM enclosure.Â  Vatick \r\n  testified she would then withdraw money from the ATM and immediately count it.Â Â  \r\n\r\nOn the day in question, Vatick drove \r\n  to Credit Union, accompanied by her nephew.Â  Due to construction outside of \r\n  Credit Unionâ€™s building, Vatick was forced to park on the right side of the \r\n  building, in a space where she never parked before. \r\n  [2] Â  Vatick parked the car and walked over to the ATM.Â  Vatick testified \r\n  that she walked through the construction site along a path that included two \r\n  steps in order to reach the ATM.Â  Vatick stated that she saw red cones in the \r\n  construction area and agreed with defense counselâ€™s contention that such cones \r\n  generally indicated that one should â€œproceed with caution.â€Â  However, Vatick \r\n  testified there were no warning signs, handrailings, or personnel from Credit \r\n  Union present at the site to warn her to watch her step.Â Â Â  \r\nWhile Vatick stated the path through \r\n  the construction site was â€œnarrow,â€ Vatick did not require her nephewâ€™s assistance \r\n  to reach the ATM.Â  In fact, Vatick successfully navigated the parking lot, the \r\n  temporary path, and the two unfamiliar steps up to the ATM.Â  Vatick testified \r\n  the steps to the ATM were not obstructed.Â  After Vatick used the ATM, she began \r\n  to count her money.Â  She testified that she was â€œintriguedâ€ by the design of \r\n  the new twenty-dollar bill, and began to walk back to her car while looking \r\n  at the bill.Â  Vatick fell down the two steps on the temporary path and was injured.Â  \r\n  She filed a complaint alleging Credit Union was â€œnegligent, reckless, and breached \r\n  the dutiesâ€ owed to her.Â  \r\nAt the close of Vatickâ€™s case, \r\n  Credit Union moved for a directed verdict.Â  The trial judge granted the motion.Â  \r\n  Though Vatick filed a motion for reconsideration under Rule 59(e), SCRCP, it \r\n  was denied.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn deciding whether to grant \r\n  or deny a directed verdict motion, the trial court is concerned only with the \r\n  existence or non-existence of evidence.â€Â  Sims v. Giles, 343 S.C. 708, \r\n  714, 541 S.E.2d 857, 861 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  This court can reverse the trial \r\n  court only when there is no evidence to support the ruling below.Â  Sabb v. \r\n  South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nVatick\r\nargues the trial court erred in granting Credit Unionâ€™s motion for a directed\r\nverdict.&nbsp; We do not agree.\r\n In order to establish a claim \r\n  for negligence, the plaintiff must prove the following elements:Â  1) a duty \r\n  of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff; 2) a breach of that duty by \r\n  the defendantâ€™s negligent act or omission; 3) the plaintiff was damaged; and \r\n  4) the damages proximately resulted from the breach of the duty.Â  Thomasko \r\n  v. Poole, 349 S.C. 7, 11, 561 S.E.2d 597, 599 (2002).Â  â€œIn a negligence \r\n  action, the court must determine, as a matter of law, whether the defendant \r\n  owed a duty of care to the plaintiff.â€Â  Faile v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of \r\n  Juvenile Justice, 350 S.C. 315, 334, 566 S.E.2d 536, 545 (2002) (citation \r\n  omitted); see also Doe v. Batson, 345 S.C. 316, 322-23, \r\n  548 S.E.2d 854, 857 (2001) (â€œAn essential element in a cause of action for negligence \r\n  is the existence of a legal duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff.â€).Â Â Â Â \r\n  â€œA merchant is not an insurer \r\n    of the safety of his customer but owes only the duty of exercising ordinary \r\n    care to keep the premises in reasonably safe condition.â€Â  Garvin v. Bi-Lo, \r\n    Inc., 343 S.C. 625, 628, 541 S.E.2d 831, 832 (2001) (citation omitted); \r\n    see also Wintersteen v. Food Lion, Inc., 344 S.C. 32, \r\n    36, 542 S.E.2d 728, 730 (2001) (â€œStorekeeper liability is founded upon the \r\n    duty of care a possessor of land owes to an invitee.â€).Â  A merchant does not \r\n    owe a duty to maintain its premises in such a condition that no accident could \r\n    happen to a patron.Â  See Denton v. Winn-Dixie Greenville, Inc., \r\n    312 S.C. 119, 120, 439 S.E.2d 292, 293 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  â€œTo recover damages \r\n    for injuries caused by a dangerous or defective condition on a storekeeperâ€™s \r\n    premises, the plaintiff must show either (1) that the injury was caused by \r\n    a specific act of the respondent which created the dangerous condition; or \r\n    (2) that the respondent had actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous \r\n    condition and failed to remedy it.â€Â  Garvin, 343 S.C. at 628, 541 S.E.2d \r\n    at 832 (citations omitted).\r\n   Credit Union, as a merchant, \r\n    owed Vatick the duty of exercising ordinary care to keep its premises, including \r\n    its passageways, in a reasonably safe condition.Â  See Wintersteen, \r\n    344 S.C. at 36, 542 S.E.2d at 730 (stating that a merchant owes a duty to \r\n    keep aisles and passageways in a reasonably safe condition).Â  Therefore, under \r\n    the two part analysis set forth in Garvin, Vatick must present evidence \r\n    to prove either that her injury was caused by a specific act by Credit Union \r\n    which created a dangerous condition or that Credit Union had knowledge of \r\n    a dangerous condition and failed to remedy it.Â  See Garvin, \r\n    343 S.C. at 628, 541 S.E.2d at 832.Â  \r\n  Vatick failed to present evidence to \r\n    satisfy the first part of the Garvin test, that her injuries resulted \r\n    from a specific act of Credit Union that created a dangerous condition.Â  Initially, \r\n    we note Vatick does not identify a particular hazard that proximately caused \r\n    her to fall.Â  Rather, she appears to imply the construction site in the entire \r\n    ATM area was hazardous.Â  While Credit Union initiated the construction work \r\n    on its premises, we do not find it created a dangerous condition.Â  Vatick \r\n    testified there was a â€œnarrowâ€ path to the ATM, but she did not state she \r\n    had any trouble walking along it.Â  Vatick also testified her view of the area \r\n    was unobstructed and that she noticed red cones in the area.Â  However, Vatick \r\n    did not state these cones were blocking the path and testified that she knew \r\n    this indicated she should be cautious.Â  Further, while Vatickâ€™s testimony \r\n    seems to imply the addition of an extra step leading up to the ATM caused \r\n    her to fall, Vatick testified she noticed the path had two steps and successfully \r\n    navigated the steps on her way to the ATM.Â  This court has found a merchant \r\n    was not liable when a customer was injured after failing to step over a clearly \r\n    visible and unobstructed object.Â  See Denton, 312 S.C. at 121-22, \r\n    439 S.E.2d at 294 (finding the store was not liable when the patron testified \r\n    she saw the clearly visible concrete dividers in the parking lot but that \r\n    she was preoccupied and tripped over one of the dividers).Â  Finally, Vatick \r\n    suggests that the lack of railings along the path and steps created a dangerous \r\n    condition; however, because we find the construction, path, and step did not \r\n    create a dangerous condition as they existed, this argument is without merit.\r\n  Vatick also failed to present evidence \r\n    to satisfy the second part of the Garvin test, that Credit Union had \r\n    actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition and failed to \r\n    remedy it.Â  Vatick appears to argue Credit Union should have known, by virtue \r\n    of performing construction in the ATM area, that a dangerous condition could \r\n    have resulted.Â  However, Vatick failed to establish that a dangerous condition \r\n    did result or that Credit Union had actual or constructive knowledge of any \r\n    such dangerous condition.Â  See id. at 121, 439 S.E.2d at 294 \r\n    (â€œAccidents may happen around . . . steps, escalators, and other raised structures.Â  \r\n    This does not mean they are unreasonably dangerous or that a person exercising \r\n    due care would not have them on the premises.Â  They are, in fact, common structures \r\n    that a person taking reasonable care for his own safety would likely expect \r\n    and see while on the premises.â€).Â  By Vatickâ€™s own testimony, she did not \r\n    require any assistance to walk from the parking lot to the path through the \r\n    construction area, and up the two steps to the ATM.Â  Further, Vatick admitted \r\n    that she fell down after she left the ATM and was examining the new twenty-dollar \r\n    bill while walking to her car.\r\n  It is axiomatic that one cannot prevail \r\n    on a negligence claim without proving a breach of duty.Â  Because Vatick cannot \r\n    prove Credit Union breached its duty to exercise ordinary care to keep its \r\n    premises in a reasonably safe condition, she cannot prevail on this negligence \r\n    action.Â  See Thomasko, 349 S.C. at 11-12, 561 S.E.2d at 599.Â  \r\n    Accordingly, the trial court did not err in granting Credit Unionâ€™s motion \r\n    for a directed verdict.\r\n  CONCLUSION \r\n     Based upon the foregoing, the trial \r\n      courtâ€™s grant of Credit Unionâ€™s motion for a directed verdict is \r\n     AFFIRMED.\r\n    HEARN, C.J., ANDERSON and BEATTY, \r\n      J.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Vatickâ€™s daughter, who was a Credit Union employee at the time of \r\n    the accident, testified there was construction at the site in order to erect \r\n    a new drive-up ATM and eliminate the walk-up ATM.Â  Â Â \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Dudek, of Columbia, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster; Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh; Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson; \r\n  Senior Assistant Attorney General William Edgar Salter III, of Columbia; Solicitor \r\n  Harold W. Gowdy III, of Spartanburg; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: William Charles Seich (â€œSeichâ€) \r\n  was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.Â  \r\n  Seich argues on appeal the circuit court erred by admitting into evidence a \r\n  bullet found at the unsecured crime scene nine days after the murder.Â  We affirm. \r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nOn October 28, 2001, a shooting incident took place \r\n  at the home of Patricia Parris (â€œParrisâ€) that resulted in her death. Â According \r\n  to Parrisâ€™s daughters, eleven year-old Deann Wilson (â€œDeannâ€) and fourteen year-old \r\n  Janice Wilson (â€œJaniceâ€), Seich was drinking liquor when they arrived home that \r\n  evening with their mother.Â  Deann testified Parris and Seich began arguing and \r\n  Seich pushed Parris and pulled her by the hair. Â Â Parris placed a call \r\n  to 911.Â  Â Deann testified she and Parris ran outside when Seich pulled \r\n  out a gun.Â  Janice was not able to exit the mobile home.Â Â  Janice testified \r\n  Seich pushed her back into the mobile home, causing her to fall on the floor.Â  \r\n  Deann stated after she and Parris ran outside, â€œthe police pulled up and he \r\n  [Seich] shot Momma.â€ \r\nWhen Officers Kevin Carper (â€œCarperâ€) \r\n  and Jeremy Soukup (â€œSoukupâ€) arrived at the scene, they observed Parris and \r\n  Seich on the front porch.Â  Soukup testified he â€œheard two, sounded like a cannon \r\n  to me, shots at point blank range, which I mean is less than a foot, and Mrs. \r\n  Parris disappeared off that front porch.â€ Â Soukup said he and Carper \r\n  drew fire at Seich to protect Parris and Deann.Â  Soukup and Carper both testified \r\n  they did not fire their weapons until Seich fired his gun and they saw Parris \r\n  fall. Â Officer Carper accidentally shot Janice when he was firing at \r\n  Seich.Â  Â Janice testified after she and Seich were shot, he started saying \r\n  he loved her and was sorry he shot Parris. \r\nThe police used 9mm guns and Seich \r\n  used a .44 Magnum pistol.Â Â  When the SLED agents processed the crime scene on \r\n  the night of the shooting, they used a metal detector and found seventeen 9mm \r\n  cartridge casings outside.Â Â  Inside, they found Seichâ€™s gun with four unfired \r\n  bullets and two fired cartridge casings, a .44 caliber fired cartridge casing, \r\n  and a fired projectile.Â  They also found a spent projectile from a .44 caliber \r\n  weapon in the dishwasher of an adjacent mobile home. \r\nNine days after the incident, one of the agents \r\n  returned to the scene, which had been unsecured since the shooting, and \r\n  found a spent .44 caliber bullet outside on the ground in the approximate location \r\n  where Parrisâ€™s body had been dragged.Â  The State offered the bullet into \r\n  evidence, and Seich moved to exclude it.Â  The trial judge allowed the bullet \r\n  into evidence, but limited the applicable testimony to the fact it was found \r\n  at the scene.\r\nDr. David Wren, the pathologist who performed the \r\n  autopsy on Parris, testified Parris died from a single gunshot wound to the \r\n  chest and the injury to the chest was more likely caused by a .44 caliber weapon \r\n  than a 9mm weapon.Â  Â Â \r\nThe jury convicted Seich of murder \r\n  and the trial judge sentenced him to life imprisonment without parole.Â  Seich \r\n  appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis Court may not reverse the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  ruling on the admissibility of evidence absent an abuse of discretion or the \r\n  commission of legal error that results in prejudice to the defendant.

Manning, 329 S.C. 1, 7, 495 S.E.2d 191, 194 (1997).Â  Â Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSeich argues the trial court erred \r\n  by admitting the bullet into evidence.Â  We find any error committed by the trial \r\n  court was harmless.\r\nSeich contends the State failed to lay \r\n  a proper foundation to connect the bullet to the crime.Â  Furthermore, Seich \r\n  argues the introduction of the .44 caliber bullet invited speculation about \r\n  its connection to the shooting.Â Â Â  \r\nAlthough it is troubling the bullet was found nine \r\n  days after the shooting, and from an unsecured crime scene, we find, even assuming \r\n  the trial court erred in allowing it into evidence, the error was harmless.Â  \r\n  â€œError is harmless where it could not reasonably have affected the result of \r\n  the trial.â€Â  Adams, 354 S.C. at 380, 580 S.E.2d at 795; State v. Burton, \r\n  326 S.C. 605, 610, 486 S.E.2d 762, 764 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Appellate courts will \r\n  not set aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not affecting the result.Â  \r\n  State v.

Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1989)).\r\nNotwithstanding the admission of the bullet, the \r\n  State presented abundant evidence proving Seichâ€™s guilt.Â  For example, Deann \r\n  testified she saw Seich shoot her mother.Â  Â Janice also testified Seich \r\n  said he was sorry he shot her mother.Â  Officers Soukup and Carper testified \r\n  they did not begin firing until they saw Parris fall.Â Â  \r\nIn addition, the pathologistâ€™s testimony regarding \r\n  the gunshot wounds provides evidence of Seichâ€™s guilt.Â  He testified the fatal \r\n  wound to Parrisâ€™s chest was approximately .41 inches by .60 inches in diameter.Â  \r\n  The diameter of a 9mm bullet is .354 inches, whereas the diameter of a .44 caliber \r\n  bullet is .44 inches.Â  Based on the size of Parrisâ€™s wound, the pathologist \r\n  determined it was more likely caused by the larger .44 caliber bullet.Â  Â Because \r\n  Seich was using a .44 caliber weapon and the officers were using 9mm weapons, \r\n  the pathologistâ€™s testimony is strong evidence proving Seichâ€™s guilt.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the above evidence of Seichâ€™s guilt, we find \r\n  any error committed by the trial court in admitting the .44 caliber bullet into \r\n  evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Allowing the bullet into evidence \r\n  did not result in any prejudice to Seich.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the \r\n  trial judge is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., and CURETON, AJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-193","title":"SC Department of Social Services v.

Hills, of Myrtle Beach, for Appellant.\r\nRonald R. Norton, of Conway, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â  Irene Oakley filed \r\n  a creditorâ€™s claim against the Estate of Arthur Oliver Sedano (â€œthe Estateâ€) \r\n  to collect past due child support accruing during Sedanoâ€™s lifetime.Â  The Estate \r\n  denied Oakleyâ€™s claim.Â  Thereafter, Oakley sued the Estate to enforce the New \r\n  York child support order.Â  The Estate answered the complaint, asserting:Â  1) \r\n  Oakleyâ€™s claim was barred by the statute of limitations; and 2) Oakleyâ€™s claim \r\n  was barred by laches.Â  During trial, the Estate also asserted Oakley was required \r\n  to file her judgment pursuant to South Carolina Code Annotated section 20-7-1130, \r\n  et seq., (1985 &amp; Supp. 2002), prior to enforcing the New York support \r\n  order in the South Carolina courts.Â  The probate court concluded none of the \r\n  Estateâ€™s defenses applied.Â  The court ruled in favor of Oakley, awarding her \r\n  the child support arrearage and interest.Â  The Estate appealed to the circuit \r\n  court, and the circuit court reversed, ruling Oakleyâ€™s claim was barred:Â  1) \r\n  by the statute of limitations; 2) by laches; and 3) because she failed to file \r\n  her judgment pursuant to section 20-7-1130, et seq.Â  Oakley appeals.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOakley and Sedano were divorced in New \r\n  York on June 7, 1945.Â  Pursuant to their divorce decree, Sedano was required \r\n  to pay fifteen dollars per week in child support.Â  Sedano never made any child \r\n  support payments.Â  \r\nIn 1998, Sedano died in Surfside Beach, South Carolina.Â  \r\n  Thereafter, in 1999, Oakley filed a creditorâ€™s claim for past due child support \r\n  against the Estate.Â  As stated earlier, the Estate denied the claim, and Oakley \r\n  sued the Estate in probate court, attempting to enforce the New York child support \r\n  order.Â Â  The Estate answered the complaint, arguing:Â  1) Oakleyâ€™s claim was \r\n  barred by the statute of limitations; and 2) Oakleyâ€™s claim was barred by laches.Â  \r\n  Additionally, during the trial, the Estate asserted Oakley was required to file \r\n  her judgment pursuant to section 20-7-1130, et seq., prior to enforcing \r\n  it in the South Carolina courts.Â  The probate court ruled none of the Estateâ€™s \r\n  defenses applied, found in favor of Oakley, and awarded her $73,800.85, plus \r\n  attorney fees and costs.Â  Subsequently, the Estate appealed to the circuit court, \r\n  and the circuit court reversed, ruling Oakleyâ€™s claim is barred:Â  1) by the \r\n  statute of limitations; 2) by laches; and 3) because she failed to file her \r\n  judgment pursuant to section 20-7-1130, et seq.Â  Oakley appeals to this \r\n  Court, arguing the circuit court erred by ruling Oakleyâ€™s claim is barred:Â  \r\n  1) by the statute of limitations; 2) by the doctrine of laches; and 3) because \r\n  she failed to file her judgment pursuant to section 20-7-1130, et seq.Â  \r\n  We conclude laches bars Oakleyâ€™s claim, and thus, we need not address her remaining \r\n  issues.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe standard of review applicable to cases originating \r\n  in the probate court is controlled by whether the underlying cause of action \r\n  is at law or in equity.Â  In re Thames, 344 S.C. 564, 568, 544 S.E.2d \r\n  854, 856 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  An action to enforce a child support decree is an \r\n  action in equity.Â  See Bentrim v. Bentrim, 282 S.C. 333, 335, \r\n  318 S.E.2d 131, 132-33 (Ct. App. 1984); see also Johnson v. Johnson, \r\n  194 S.C. 115, 122, 8 S.E.2d 351, 354 (1940) (holding the nature of an alimony \r\n  award is not altered by attempting to enforce it in a foreign jurisdiction, \r\n  and thus, it remains an action in equity).Â  â€œIn an appeal in equity cases . \r\n  . . [an appellate] [c]ourt has jurisdiction to find the facts in accord with \r\n  its view of the preponderance of the evidence and may reverse findings of fact \r\n  by the trial court when the appellant satisfies . . . [the appellate] [c]ourt \r\n  that such findings are without evidentiary support or are against the clear \r\n  preponderance of the evidence.â€ Vereen v. Bell, 256 S.C. 249, 252-53, \r\n  182 S.E.2d 296, 297 (1971).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOakley argues the circuit court erred \r\n  by applying the doctrine of laches.Â  We disagree.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œUnder the doctrine of laches, if a party, \r\n  knowing its rights, does not seasonably assert them, but by unreasonable delay \r\n  suffers its adversary to detrimentally change its position, then the courts \r\n  will ordinarily refuse to enforce these rights.â€Â  Provident Life &amp; Acc. \r\n  Ins. Co. v. Driver, 317 S.C. 471, 478, 451 S.E.2d 924, 929 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  \r\n  â€œDelay alone in the assertion of a right does not constitute laches.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n  â€œ[L]aches arises upon the failure to assert a known right under circumstances \r\n  indicating that the lached party has abandoned or surrendered the right.â€Â  Id., \r\n  at 479, 451 S.E.2d at 929.Â  â€œThe lached party must have had actual knowledge \r\n  or inquiry notice of the facts forming the basis of its claim, and its failure \r\n  to assert its right is irrelevant until there is a reason or situation that \r\n  demands assertion.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe evidence in the record indicates that following \r\n  the divorce in 1945, Oakley was awarded fifteen dollars a month in child support.Â  \r\n  Sedano did not pay any of the child support payments.Â  The record also indicates \r\n  Oakley attempted to find Sedano following the child support award.Â  However, \r\n  Oakleyâ€™s attempts to find Sedano were solely manifested by asking other family \r\n  members where he was.Â  By her own admission, she never used any other method \r\n  to attempt to locate Sedano.Â  Furthermore, according to Oakleyâ€™s own testimony, \r\n  Oakley ceased looking for Sedano in 1951 or 1952 when she remarried.Â  \r\nViewing this evidence, we conclude Oakleyâ€™s delay \r\n  in asserting her rights was unreasonable, as she did not attempt to enforce \r\n  the decree until fifty-five years after its issue, and, by her own admission, \r\n  she ceased her attempts to find Sedano after either 1951 or 1952. [1] Â  Thus, our only remaining inquiry \r\n  is whether the Estate has been prejudiced by Oakleyâ€™s unreasonable delay.\r\nThe child support decree required Sedano to pay \r\n  Oakley fifteen dollars per week.Â  Oakleyâ€™s complaint alleged Sedanoâ€™s arrearage \r\n  totaled $12,060.00 in principal.Â  Furthermore, with interest, Oakleyâ€™s complaint \r\n  alleged Sedanoâ€™s arrearage totaled $406,000.00.Â  The probate court awarded Oakley \r\n  $73,800.85 in arrearages against the Estate, due in a lump sum.\r\nBased on this evidence, we conclude the Estate \r\n  has been prejudiced by Oakleyâ€™s delay in initiating this action, as interest \r\n  has been accruing on the arrearage for approximately fifty-five years.\r\nHaving concluded Oakley failed to seasonably initiate \r\n  this action and the Estate was prejudiced by her inaction, we hold the circuit \r\n  court properly applied the doctrine of laches to this case.Â Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the above, the decision of the \r\n  circuit court is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., HOWARD, and KITTREDGE, \r\n  JJ., concurring.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Oakley argues her delay was reasonable because she was a waitress \r\n    in New York City, lacking the ability to hire a private investigator or the \r\n    knowledge to find Sedano herself.Â  However, Oakley did not present any evidence \r\n    outside her own testimony indicating her financial position during the fifty-five \r\n    years prior to filing this action.Â  Furthermore, her testimony indicates her \r\n    financial position improved following her remarriage in 1951, the same time \r\n    she ceased her efforts to find Sedano.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-195","title":"State v.

Grady Jordan, of Easley, for Appellant. \r\nGene W. Dukes, of St. George, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Betty Judy sued Marion Howell \r\n  and Ronnie Elrod alleging a trespass on her property and seeking an injunction \r\n  and damages.Â  Howell appeals the trial courtâ€™s ruling in Judyâ€™s favor.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1] Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nHowell and Judy are owners of adjoining \r\n  properties fronting Interstate 95 in Dorchester County.Â  In 1979, Howellâ€™s husband \r\n  erected and began leasing a roadside advertising sign near a disputed common \r\n  boundary between the two properties.Â  Following a survey of her property in \r\n  January 1996, Judy discovered Howellâ€™s sign was located on her property. Â Consequently, \r\n  she brought an action against Howell for trespass and sought an easement across \r\n  both Howellâ€™s and Elrodâ€™s property to reach a portion of her property landlocked \r\n  by I-95.Â  The trial court dismissed Judyâ€™s easement cause of action and granted \r\n  summary judgment in favor of Howell on the trespass claim based on res judicata, \r\n  citing a 1993 easement action previously brought by her late husband that was \r\n  dismissed. Â On appeal, this court reversed the dismissal of Judyâ€™s trespass \r\n  action, finding the issue did not accrue until the final resolution of the prior \r\n  1993 claim. [2] Â  Following a \r\n  trial on the merits of Judyâ€™s trespass claim, the master concluded Judy held \r\n  title to the plot of land where Howell erected the sign and ordered Howell to \r\n  pay the amount of money Howell earned from the lease since January 1, 1996.Â  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAn action brought to determine title to a disputed \r\n  parcel of land is a trespass action to try title, which is an action at law.Â  \r\n  Watson v. Suggs, 313 S.C. 291, 293, 437 S.E.2d 172, 173 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\n  Accordingly, our scope of review is limited to correction of errors of law, \r\n  and we will not disturb the master's factual findings that have some evidentiary \r\n  support.Â  Townes Assocs. Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 85, \r\n  221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  \r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Location of Boundary Line\r\nHowell argues the master erred by determining the advertising sign was located \r\n  on Judyâ€™s property without first ruling upon the exact location of the common \r\n  boundary line between the properties.Â  We disagree.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nNeither Judy nor Howell asked the master to make a determination on the location \r\n  of the common boundary line between their properties.Â  As such, this issue was \r\n  not properly presented to the lower court and is not preserved for our review.Â  \r\n  Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 \r\n  (2000) (holding it is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first \r\n  time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court \r\n  to be preserved for appellate review.).Â  \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Title to the Plot Where the Sign is Located\r\nHowell argues the master erred in finding that \r\n  Judy had title to the plot where the sign is located.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs the party bringing the trespass action, Judy \r\n  carried the burden of proof that she held title to the plot at the time of Howellâ€™s \r\n  trespass. Cummings v. Varn, 307 S.C. 37, 41, 413 S.E.2d 829, 831 (1992) \r\n  (holding in an action of trespass to try title, a defendant in actual possession, \r\n  not obtained by a tortuous eviction, is regarded as the rightful owner until \r\n  the plaintiff proves perfect title.).Â  \r\nBen Coker, Jr., Judyâ€™s surveyor, testified he relied \r\n  upon his own personal measurements made in the field, an old unrecorded plat, \r\n  and State Highway Department drawings of I-95 to prepare the 1996 plat showing \r\n  the location of Howellâ€™s sign on Judyâ€™s property.Â  Coker additionally testified \r\n  â€œthat sign, based on our calculations and measurements, is on the property owned \r\n  by Miss Judy.â€Â  In light of the plat description and the surveyorâ€™s testimony, \r\n  we find there was evidence from which the master could conclude Judy met her \r\n  burden of proof to assert title to the plot.Â  \r\nHowell complains the trial court improperly \r\n  overruled the objections to Cokerâ€™s testimony and the admission of the 1996 \r\n  plat because Coker was not a licensed surveyor and therefore was not qualified \r\n  to testify to the findings recorded on the plat.Â  While Howellâ€™s challenges \r\n  may raise questions about Cokerâ€™s credibility or the weight to be given Cokerâ€™s \r\n  findings, they do not render his testimony and plat inadmissible.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we reject Howellâ€™s challenges to Coker and his testimony.Â  Bodiford v. Spanish \r\n  Oak Farms, 317 S.C. 539, 544-545, 455 S.E.2d 194, 197 (Ct. App. 1995) (holding \r\n  an appellate court cannot judge the weight or credibility of testimony on appeal \r\n  in a law case.).Â  \r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damages\r\nHowell contends the master erred in awarding damages \r\n  to Judy in an unspecified sum.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe masterâ€™s order required Howell to pay Judy \r\n  a sum equal to all monies Howell received from her lease of the sign from January \r\n  1, 1996â€”the month in which Judy confirmed the trespass on her property.Â  Only \r\n  one party had leased the sign during that period of time.Â  Thus, the amount \r\n  is easily determined and is the equivalent of a sum certain as required by Rule \r\n  58(a)(1), SCRCP.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF and STILWELL, JJ., and CURETON, \r\n  A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule \r\n    215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  See Judy v.

Domin and Ronnie F. Craig, both\r\nof Charleston, for Respondent. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The personal representative \r\n  of the Estate of Erik Krenn appeals the grant of summary judgment to State Farm \r\n  Mutual Automobile Insurance Company.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nSixteen-year-old Erik Krenn was driving \r\n  a BMW owned by his father when he pulled into a driveway to turn around.Â  Krenn \r\n  and his friend, Christopher Diaz, were the only occupants of the car.Â  An uninsured \r\n  Chevrolet with four occupants pulled up on the street behind the Krenn vehicle, \r\n  blocking it in the driveway.Â  At least one of the Chevroletâ€™s passengers, Antonio \r\n  Gordon, exited the vehicle and approached the BMW on the driverâ€™s side.Â  In \r\n  both his statement and affidavit, Diaz stated Gordon demanded money and asked \r\n  if Krenn wanted some marijuana. [1] \r\n  Â  After Krenn declined the offer, the Chevrolet moved slightly forward, \r\n  allowing the BMW to back out of the driveway. Â Krenn backed the BMW out \r\n  of the driveway and around the Chevrolet until the two vehicles were roughly \r\n  parallel in the street. Â At that point, Gordonâ€”still standing near the \r\n  BMWâ€”pointed a gun at Krenn and threatened to shoot him.Â  Diaz stated Gordon \r\n  reached into the BMW and briefly grabbed the steering wheel.Â  After Krenn put \r\n  the BMW into gear and started to drive away, Gordon shot him.Â  Krenn ultimately \r\n  died as a result of this gunshot wound.Â  \r\n Krennâ€™s father insured the BMW and six \r\n  additional vehicles with State Farm.Â  Each of the seven vehicles had liability \r\n  limits of $25,000, and it was agreed that if coverage existed, the policies \r\n  would be stackable and the estate would be able to collect $175,000. Â State \r\n  Farm moved for summary judgment, arguing there was no genuine issue of material \r\n  fact and it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  The trial court granted \r\n  the motion, finding the estate â€œfailed to establish that the facts in this case \r\n  meet the requirements under South Carolina law to establish coverage.â€Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary judgment is proper when it is \r\n  clear there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party \r\n  is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  West v. Gladney, 341 S.C. \r\n  127, 132, 533 S.E.2d 334, 336 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œSummary judgment can be granted \r\n  when plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds \r\n  cannot differ.â€Â  Byerly v. Connor, 307 S.C. 441, 445, 415 S.E.2d 796, \r\n  799 (1992).\r\nâ€œIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, \r\n  this Court applies the same standard which governs the trial court . . . .â€Â  \r\n  Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).Â  â€œIn determining \r\n  whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences \r\n  therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  â€œOn appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate \r\n  court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and \r\n  from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.â€Â  \r\n  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n The estate argues the master erred in granting State \r\n  Farmâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  Specifically, the estate argues the Chevrolet \r\n  was used as an active accessory to the attempted carjacking and Krennâ€™s subsequent \r\n  death.Â  We do not agree.\r\nAn insured is legally entitled to recover \r\n  damages arising out of the â€œownership, maintenance, or useâ€ of an uninsured \r\n  vehicle.Â  State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Aytes, 332 S.C. 30, 33, 503 \r\n  S.E.2d 744, 745 (1998) (quoting S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-140 (1989)).Â  In order \r\n  to determine if an individualâ€™s injuries are covered by an automobile insurance \r\n  policy, the insured must prove the following:Â  (1) there exists a causal connection \r\n  between the vehicle and the injury; (2) no act of independent significance breaks \r\n  the causal link; and (3) the vehicle was being used for transportation at the \r\n  time of the assault.Â  State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Bookert, 337 \r\n  S.C. 291, 293, 523 S.E.2d 181, 182 (1999) (citation omitted).Â  \r\nFurthermore, the â€œcausal connectionâ€ aspect of \r\n  this three-part test means (1) the vehicle was an â€œactive accessoryâ€ to the \r\n  assault; (2) something less than proximate cause but more than mere site of \r\n  the injury; and (3) that the â€œinjury must be foreseeably identifiable with the \r\n  normal use of the automobile.â€Â  Id.  \r\nThe first prong of the Bookert \r\n  test mandates that, in order to recover damages, the estate must prove there \r\n  was a causal connection between the Chevrolet and Krennâ€™s death.Â  The trial \r\n  court held there was no causal connection in this case, and we agree.Â  The Chevrolet \r\n  was not an active accessory to Krennâ€™s assault because Gordon had exited the \r\n  Chevrolet and was standing beside the BMW when he shot Krenn.Â  Further, while \r\n  the Chevrolet had originally blocked the BMW in the driveway, at the time of \r\n  the shooting the Chevrolet had moved in order to allow the BMW to proceed.Â  \r\n  Assessing these facts, it is apparent that not only was the uninsured vehicle \r\n  not an active accessory to the assault, it was not even the actual site of the \r\n  injury, as the vehicle itself was neither part of the assault nor was the assailant \r\n  inside the vehicle at the time Krenn was shot.Â  Additionally, Krennâ€™s shooting \r\n  was not â€œforeseeably identifiableâ€ with the normal use of the uninsured vehicle.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we find the causal connection prong of the Bookert test \r\n  is not satisfied in this case.Â  \r\nAssuming the facts before us support the causal \r\n  connection element, the second element of the Bookert test is not met \r\n  in this case.Â  When Gordon exited the Chevrolet before shooting Krenn, this \r\n  was an â€œact of independent significanceâ€ that served to break the causal link \r\n  of the Chevroletâ€™s involvement in Krennâ€™s assault.Â  In a similar situation, \r\n  the supreme court has held that any causal connection is broken when the assailant \r\n  exits the vehicle.Â  Aytes, 332 S.C. at 35, 503 S.E.2d at 746.Â  \r\nNotwithstanding the outcome of the Bookert \r\n  test, the estate argues that in Unisun Ins. Co. v. Schmidt, 339 S.C. \r\n  362, 529 S.E.2d 280 (2000), the supreme court held injuries resulting from a \r\n  carjacking were covered by the uninsured motorist statute.Â  However, in Schmidt, \r\n  the court considered whether coverage was allowed when the vehicle considered \r\n  uninsured is the carjacked vehicle.Â  This scenario does not apply in the instant \r\n  case, as Krennâ€™s BMW was an insured vehicle and the assailantâ€™s Chevrolet was \r\n  uninsured.Â  Even though the evidence indicates that Gordon briefly grabbed the \r\n  steering wheel of the Krenn vehicle, there is no evidence that he exercised \r\n  any control over it to such an extent that it would rise to the level of a non-permissive \r\n  use of the vehicle as was the situation in Schmidt.Â  \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF and STILWELL, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  We note the statements of the four individuals in the Chevrolet, \r\n    including Antonio Gordonâ€™s statement, are substantially the same as Diazâ€™s \r\n    statement and affidavit.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-201","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, \r\n  Assistant Attorney General W. Rutledge Martin, all of Columbia; and Solicitor \r\n  Cecil Kelley Jackson, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Theodore L. Brown, III was \r\n  convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute after police \r\n  discovered the drugs during a traffic stop.Â  Brown appeals, contending the drugs \r\n  were found after the completion of the original stop and thus pursuant to an \r\n  illegal detention under State v. Williams, 351 S.C. 591, 571 S.E.2d 703 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2002), cert. denied (June 27, 2003).Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nBACKGROUND\r\nLance Corporal Richard Ray of the South Carolina \r\n  Highway Patrol stopped a van traveling south on Interstate 95 for weaving.Â  \r\n  As Officer Ray approached the van, he noticed Brown asleep or reclining in the \r\n  rear of the vehicle.Â  After exiting the van at Rayâ€™s request, the vanâ€™s driver, \r\n  Milton Butler, explained he had been driving for twenty hours and was tired.Â  \r\n  The officer issued the driver a warning citation for weaving.Â  \r\nAs Butler turned to leave, the officer asked if \r\n  he could ask a few more questions.Â  He asked if there was anything illegal in \r\n  the vehicle, and Brown said no.Â  Ray continued to ask the driver questions, \r\n  telling him that â€œhe was not being accused of having any illegal items, but \r\n  if he did have anything illegal, such as alcohol or any marijuana, less than \r\n  an ounce, he could be given a ticket and released if he was honest.â€Â  \r\nAfter some discussion, Butler admitted there were \r\n  drugs in the van.Â  Ray then read Butler his Miranda \r\n  [1]  rights and Butler stated there was maybe a quarter of an ounce of marijuana \r\n  in the van.Â  Ray then called Lance Corporal King to the scene.Â  Butler again \r\n  admitted there was marijuana in the van.Â  Another officer arrived and Brown \r\n  was asked to exit the vehicle.Â  \r\nWhen King arrived, he circled the vehicle with \r\n  a drug dog several times.Â  He then entered the van with the dog and discovered \r\n  1.57 pounds of marijuana under bedding in the rear of the van.Â  \r\nBrown was found guilty of possession of marijuana \r\n  with intent to distribute following a jury trial.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nBrown argues he and the driver \r\n  were unlawfully detained when the officer continued to ask questions after issuing \r\n  the warning citation.Â  Thus he argues the marijuana was discovered during an \r\n  unlawful seizure of his person and the court should have suppressed it.Â  This \r\n  issue is not preserved.\r\nAlthough Brown moved to suppress the drugs \r\n  prior to the swearing of the jury, a motion the court denied after a hearing, \r\n  he failed to contemporaneously object when the marijuana or drug analysis were \r\n  admitted into evidence.Â  Because this evidence was admitted during the testimony \r\n  of the Stateâ€™s second and third witnesses, his failure to renew his motion precludes \r\n  appellate review of the courtâ€™s ruling.Â  State v. King, 349 S.C. 142, \r\n  149-50, 561 S.E.2d 640, 643-44 (Ct. App. 2002) (holding an in limine motion \r\n  to suppress drugs must be renewed at the time the drugs are admitted into evidence \r\n  where the courtâ€™s ruling was not obtained immediately prior to the admission); \r\n  see also State v. Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 642, 541 S.E.2d 837, \r\n  840 (2001) (holding ordinarily an evidentiary ruling in limine is not final \r\n  and an objection contemporaneous with the evidenceâ€™s admission is required to \r\n  preserve the issue for appeal).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ., and\r\nCURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Miranda v.

Bannister, Jr., of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nRandall Scott Hiller, of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Stanford Kosover appeals from \r\n  the dismissal of his complaint for an accounting and in quantum meruit.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\n    FACTS\r\nSoon after Kosover was released from prison\r\nfor a breach of trust charge, he decided to open a business for the purpose of\r\nbuying, roasting, and selling coffee to local businesses.&nbsp;\r\nHe contacted attorney Bobby Mann, a personal friend, who assisted Kosover\r\nin incorporating the business as Metro Coffee House, Inc.&nbsp;\r\nThe business was organized with Mann as the sole stockholder, and he\r\nowned the building in which it was located.&nbsp;\r\nKosover paid rent to Mann and handled all the operations and finances of\r\nthe business.&nbsp;\r\nSeveral\r\nyears after opening the Metro Coffee House, Kosover decided to slowly expand the\r\npremises to include retail sales and a wine bar.&nbsp;\r\nApproximately one to two years later, Kosover became romantically\r\ninvolved with Stenger, who assisted in expanding the shop.&nbsp;\r\nIn order to finance the expansion, Kosover borrowed money from several\r\nindividuals, and Stenger supplied personal funds and took out a bank loan.&nbsp; Stenger then entered into a lease with Mann for the building\r\nspace and incorporated the new business as the Metro Wine Room, Inc. Stenger was\r\nthe sole stockholder of the Metro Wine Room.&nbsp; A little over two years later, Kosover and Stenger ended\r\ntheir personal relationship, and Kosover sent Stenger a letter outlining their\r\noptions with respect to dividing Metro Wine Roomâ€™s assets.&nbsp;\r\nStenger replied that Kosover could acquire the property from her, if he\r\ndesired.&nbsp; Stenger then changed the\r\nlocks on the property, acquired new business partners, changed the name of the\r\nwine bar, and continued business in the location.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Kosover filed a complaint against \r\n      Stenger and Metro Wine Room seeking damages based on quantum meruit \r\n      and alleging he was entitled to an accounting of the partiesâ€™ joint venture.Â  \r\n      Stenger and the Metro Wine Room filed an answer denying Kosoverâ€™s allegations.Â  \r\n      In addition, Stenger counterclaimed that she was entitled to reimbursement \r\n      for certain rents and labors she performed.Â  At trial, Kosover admitted \r\n      on cross-examination that the lease had to be in Stengerâ€™s name because \r\n      a beer and wine permit eventually would be required.Â  Kosover explained \r\n      that his â€œprior criminal historyâ€ meant that he would be unable to apply \r\n      for such a permit.Â  After a bench trial, the trial court issued an order \r\n      dismissing both Kosoverâ€™s complaint and Stengerâ€™s counterclaim.Â  The court \r\n      found that Kosover was barred as a matter of law from obtaining a beer and \r\n      wine permit due to his prior incarceration. The judge further found that, \r\n      even if the enterprise were legal, Kosoverâ€™s testimony was not credible \r\n      and there was a â€œcomplete lack of credible evidence as to any damages.â€Â  \r\n      Kosover appeals.\r\n    STANDARD\r\n    OF REVIEW\r\n    In equity actions tried by a trial judge alone, \r\n      this courtâ€™s scope of review extends to the findings of fact which may be \r\n      recast in this courtâ€™s own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Townes \r\n      Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, \r\n      775 (1976).Â  â€œHowever, this broad scope of review does not require an appellate \r\n      court to disregard the findings below or ignore the fact that the trial \r\n      judge is in the better position to assess the credibility of the witnesses.â€Â  \r\n      Pinckney v. Warren, 344 S.C. 382, 387, 544 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2001).\r\n    ISSUES\r\n\r\n    I.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err in finding Kosover was barred as a matter of \r\n      law from obtaining a beer and wine permit?\r\n    II.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err in finding Kosover was engaged in an illegal \r\n      enterprise?\r\n    III.Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err in finding there was no evidence of damages?\r\n\r\n\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp;\r\nBeer and Wine Permit\r\n        Kosover argues the trial court erred \r\n          in finding he was barred as a matter of law from obtaining a beer and \r\n          wine permit or from having an interest in a business that required such \r\n          a permit.Â  We do not agree.\r\n        Kosover admitted on cross-examination \r\n          that he was barred from receiving a beer and wine permit.Â  Kosover also \r\n          testified he personally completed the application for the beer and wine \r\n          permit on Stengerâ€™s behalf and neglected to provide any information \r\n          about his status as a partner in Metro Wine Room.Â  In so doing, Kosover \r\n          knowingly violated at least three statutory sections. \r\n        Section 61-4-520 states a beer and wine \r\n          permit may not be issued unless â€œ[t]he applicant, any partner or co-shareholder \r\n          of the applicant . . . to be employed on the licensed premises are of \r\n          good moral character.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 61-4-520(1) (Supp. 2003) \r\n          (emphasis added).Â  It is clear Kosover and Stenger planned to operate \r\n          Metro Wine Room as a joint venture.Â  It is also clear that because Kosover \r\n          had a recent conviction for breach of trust he could not be considered \r\n          â€œof good moral characterâ€ for purposes of obtaining the permit. [1] Â  \r\n        Section 61-2-90 of the South Carolina Code \r\n          (Supp. 2003) states each person seeking a beer and wine permit must \r\n          file an application containing a sworn statement with the South Carolina \r\n          Department of Revenue.Â  Among other things, this section requires the \r\n          applicant to include in this statement â€œinformation required by the \r\n          department to determine if the application meets all statutory requirements \r\n          for the license or permit and to determine the true owners of the business \r\n          seeking the license or permit.â€Â  Id. Kosover admitted on cross-examination \r\n          that he prepared the application for the beer and wine permit.Â  As such, \r\n          Kosover knew, as a partner in Metro Wine Room, that he must disclose \r\n          both his interest in the business and his prior criminal history, pursuant \r\n          to section 61-4-520(1).Â Â Â  \r\n        Section 61-2-100 states that beer and wine \r\n          permits may only be issued to persons who own the qualifying business.Â  \r\n          S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 61-2-100(A) (Supp. 2003).Â  This section further states \r\n          that a permit may not be issued to any applying person â€œunless the person \r\n          and all principals are of good moral character.â€Â  Id. at Â§ 61-2-100(D).Â  \r\n          Principals are defined to include all persons who own at least twenty-five \r\n          percent of the value of the business, which would, by his own testimony, \r\n          include Kosover.Â  Id. at Â§ 61-2-100(H)(2)(g).Â  Similar to sections \r\n          61-4-520(1) and 61-2-90(6), Kosover would thus be excluded under section \r\n          61-2-100 from obtaining a beer and wine permit because his conviction \r\n          for breach of trust prevents him from being of good moral character.\r\n        The cumulative application of these three \r\n          statutory sections supports the conclusion that Kosover was prohibited \r\n          from obtaining a beer and wine permit.Â  Further, Kosover was aware that \r\n          his participation in the Metro Wine Room venture was unlawful.Â  Accordingly, \r\n          the trial court did not err in finding Kosover was barred as a matter \r\n          of law from obtaining a beer and wine permit.\r\n        II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n        Illegal Enterprise\r\n        Kosover argues the trial court erred \r\n          in finding he was engaged in an illegal enterprise.Â  We disagree.\r\n        The trial court found â€œthe contract \r\n          to enter into a partnership or joint venture was for an illegal purpose \r\n          and as such may not and will not be enforced by this Court.â€Â  When Kosover \r\n          and Stenger entered into their joint venture to form and operate Metro \r\n          Wine Room, the ultimate goal was to receive a beer and wine permit in \r\n          order to open a wine bar.Â  To that end, Kosover persuaded Stenger to \r\n          put all leases, documents, and filings in her name only, though he was \r\n          an equal partner in the Metro Wine Room enterprise.Â  As discussed above, \r\n          Kosover was barred from obtaining a beer or wine permit because he had \r\n          been imprisoned for breach of trust.Â  Because Kosover was prohibited \r\n          by law from obtaining this permit, which was integral to the ultimate \r\n          purpose of the venture, the eventual acquisition of this permit and \r\n          operation of the Metro Wine Room venture was an illegal enterprise.Â  \r\n          See W &amp; N Constr. Co. v. Williams, 322 S.C. 448, 450, \r\n          472 S.E.2d 622, 623 (1996) (â€œIt is a well-founded policy of law that \r\n          no person be permitted to acquire a right of action from their own unlawful \r\n          act and one who participates in an unlawful act cannot recover damages \r\n          for the consequence of that act.â€) (quoting Jackson v. Bi-Lo Stores, \r\n          Inc., 313 S.C. 272, 276, 437 S.E.2d 168, 170 (Ct. App. 1993)).\r\n        Accordingly, the trial court did not err in \r\n          finding Kosover was engaged in an illegal enterprise.\r\n        III.Â Â Â  Evidence of Damages\r\n        Kosover argues the trial court erred \r\n          in finding there was no evidence of damages.Â  We do not agree.\r\n        Kosover had neither a leasehold \r\n          interest in the business space nor any ownership interest in Metro Wine \r\n          Room.Â  Both interests were solely in Stengerâ€™s name because Kosover \r\n          testified that his criminal record would have prevented his association \r\n          with any business applying for a beer and wine permit.Â  Kosover did \r\n          not present any evidence at trial that the loan money he was seeking \r\n          to recoup was actually invested in Metro Wine Room.Â  Although the record \r\n          contains notes executed between various individuals and Kosover, none \r\n          of these notes either mentioned Metro Wine Room or listed the business \r\n          as a party to the notes.Â  Further, Stenger testified she was not aware \r\n          of certain loans Kosover claimed were to be used for the business and, \r\n          with respect to the loans she was aware of, she did not know if they \r\n          were actually used in furtherance of the business.Â  The trial court \r\n          found Kosoverâ€™s testimony was not credible and that there was â€œno credible \r\n          evidence (beyond speculation) to establish [Kosover]â€™s alleged loss.â€Â  \r\n          As the trial court was in a better position to determine Kosoverâ€™s credibility, \r\n          we accept his assessment of Kosoverâ€™s testimony.Â  See Pinckney \r\n          v. Warren, 344 S.C. at 387, 544 S.E.2d at 623.Â  \r\n        Accordingly, the trial court did not err \r\n          in finding Kosover failed to provide any evidence of damages.\r\n        CONCLUSION\r\n        Based upon the foregoing, the trial \r\n          courtâ€™s order dismissing Kosoverâ€™s complaint is\r\n         AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., ANDERSON, and \r\n          BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n       \r\n         \r\n          [1]  Criminal breach of trust requires a fraudulent act.Â  S.C.

Williams, \r\n  305 S.C. 116, 406 S.E.2d 357 (1991), we found the transcript of the plea proceedings \r\n  indicated Appellant had orally waived presentment of the indictments to a grand \r\n  jury, but the indictments in the record were left blank in the section for waiving \r\n  presentment.Â  There were no written waivers of presentment elsewhere in the \r\n  record.Â  See State v. Lynch, 344 S.C. 635, 639, 545 S.E.2d 511, \r\n  513 (2001) (â€œA circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction if:Â  (1) there \r\n  has been an indictment which sufficiently states the offense; (2) there has \r\n  been a waiver of indictment; or (3) the charge is a lesser included charge of \r\n  the crime charged in the indictment.â€); In re Matthews, 345 S.C. 638, \r\n  643 n.4, 550 S.E.2d 311, 313 n.4 (2001) (â€œLack of subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  can be raised at any time, can be raised for the first time on appeal, and can \r\n  be raised sua sponte by the court.â€ (citation omitted)), cert. \r\n  denied, 535 U.S. 1062 (2002).\r\nAs part of its Anders review, the Court \r\n  obtained the sentencing sheets on the two charges.Â  There is a written waiver \r\n  of presentment on the sentencing sheet for the charge of pointing and presenting \r\n  a firearm.Â Â  Accordingly, the appeal as to this charge is dismissed.Â  As to \r\n  the charge of second-degree CSC with a minor, the sentencing sheet does not \r\n  contain a written waiver of presentment.Â  Consequently, we vacate the conviction \r\n  on the CSC charge as the circuit court did not have subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to accept Appellantâ€™s plea.Â  See Odom v.

[1] \r\n  Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nVictim, a ten-year-old female, was spending the \r\n  night at the home of Worley Lee Brown and his wife, Annie Brown. Â Victim \r\n  wanted to play a computer game, and Brown agreed to help her.Â  Annie walked \r\n  up to them while they were playing the game and saw Brownâ€™s hand on Victimâ€™s \r\n  genital area.Â  Upon seeing this, Annie became upset and told Brown to leave \r\n  the house. Â \r\nThe incident was reported to Rusty Garrett, \r\n  an investigator with the Anderson County Sheriffâ€™s Department.Â  With Investigator \r\n  Jami Brothers, Garrett interviewed Victim at her school.Â  Brown was indicted \r\n  following the investigation.Â  \r\nBrown voluntarily submitted to a polygraph examination.Â  \r\n  During an interview before the examination, Brown stated Victim had put his \r\n  hand down her panties immediately before Annie walked up, and admitted there \r\n  was a possibility that his finger penetrated Victimâ€™s vagina.Â  \r\nAt trial, Victim testified Brown had touched \r\n  her breasts and her vagina.Â  \r\nThe State then called Dr. Horace Smith, a pediatrician \r\n  and expert in child sexual assault who had examined Victim.Â  When the State \r\n  asked Dr. Smith what Victim had given him as far as background or history, Brown \r\n  objected.Â  Outside the juryâ€™s presence, Brownâ€™s attorney argued:Â  \r\n\r\nYour Honor, according to the State v. Dawkins and \r\n  Jolly v. State, my objection is, number one, itâ€™s hearsay; and, number \r\n  two, itâ€™s corroboration or bolstering of her witness.Â  And they â€“ she can introduce \r\n  evidence that this person indicated there was an assault, but itâ€™s limited.Â  \r\n  The details and the particulars are not admissible, but so much of the complaint \r\n  as identifies a time and a place may be shown.\r\n\r\nThe court overruled Brownâ€™s objection, and Dr. Smith \r\n  testified Victim told him someone had touched her on her genital area on more \r\n  than one occasion, and that it sometimes hurt.Â  He also testified Victim told \r\n  him she was touched repeatedly on the breasts. Â \r\nDuring the Stateâ€™s direct examination \r\n  of Annie, Brown objected to a leading question and was overruled.Â  After Brown \r\n  cross-examined Annie, the court indicated that Brownâ€™s objection was overruled \r\n  pursuant to Rule 611(c), SCRE, because Annie was â€œvery well identifiedâ€ with \r\n  Brown because she had been married to him for twenty years.Â  Accordingly, the \r\n  trial court allowed the State to ask Annie leading questions on re-direct examination.Â  \r\n\r\nDuring the cross-examination of Mary \r\n  Lesley, one of Brownâ€™s neighbors, Brown asked if Annie had ever told her that \r\n  Victim had accused her grandfather of molesting her.Â  The court sustained the \r\n  Stateâ€™s objection to the question.Â  At the conclusion of her testimony, and \r\n  outside the juryâ€™s presence, Lesley stated that she was unaware of any allegations \r\n  about Victimâ€™s grandfather. Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Other Bad Acts\r\nBrown contends the trial court erred in permitting \r\n  evidence that Brown had touched Victimâ€™s breasts at least ten times.Â  He argues \r\n  this evidence, provided through Victimâ€™s testimony and Dr. Smithâ€™s testimony, \r\n  constituted impermissible bad acts evidence.Â  This issue is not preserved.\r\nTo be preserved for appellate review, an issue \r\n  must have been raised to and ruled on by the trial judge.Â  Brown did not object \r\n  to Victimâ€™s testimony regarding these acts.Â  Thus this issue is not preserved \r\n  as to her testimony.Â  See State v. Perez, 334 S.C. 563, 565-66, \r\n  514 S.E.2d 754, 755 (1999) (issues not raised to and ruled upon by the trial \r\n  court will not be considered on appeal).Â  Further, although Brown did object \r\n  to Dr. Smithâ€™s testimony regarding these acts, his only objection to this testimony \r\n  was that it constituted hearsay and improper corroboration.Â  Because his argument \r\n  on appeal differs from the one asserted at trial, it is also not preserved for \r\n  our review.Â  State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1989) \r\n  (holding a party cannot argue grounds on appeal different than those argued \r\n  to the trial judge).\r\nII.Â  Rape Shield Law\r\nBrown argues the trial court improperly \r\n  excluded under the rape shield statute evidence of unpursued sexual abuse accusations \r\n  Victim made against her grandfather.Â  We find no error.\r\nDuring cross-examination of Brownâ€™s neighbor \r\n  Mary Lesley, Brown asked if Annie told her Victim had initially accused her \r\n  grandfather of the sexual abuse in question. Â When the State objected, \r\n  the trial court held a bench conference and sustained the objection.Â  Neither \r\n  the grounds for the objection nor the courtâ€™s rationale in sustaining it appear \r\n  in the record.\r\nAlthough the record does not reflect \r\n  the courtâ€™s reasoning, we find the objection was properly sustained because \r\n  the testimony would have been impermissible hearsay.Â  Repeating whether Annie \r\n  had told her about an accusation made by Victim would have been offered for \r\n  the truth of the matter assertedâ€”that Victim accused her grandfather of sexual \r\n  abuseâ€”and does not fall within any of the exceptions to the rule against hearsay.Â  \r\n  Rule 801, SCRE (hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered in court to prove \r\n  the truth of the matter asserted); 802, SCRE (hearsay is inadmissible except \r\n  as provided in statute or court rule); 803, SCRE (hearsay exceptions â€“ availability \r\n  of declarant immaterial).Â  Thus the trial court properly excluded the testimony.Â  \r\n  See Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 418-21, \r\n  526 S.E.2d 716, 721-25 (2000) (holding an appellate court can affirm for any \r\n  reason appearing in the record).Â  Additionally, at the conclusion of Lesleyâ€™s \r\n  testimony, she testified outside the juryâ€™s presence she was not aware of any \r\n  allegations against Victimâ€™s grandfather. Â Thus, Brown could not have \r\n  been prejudiced by the exclusion of Lesleyâ€™s testimony on the matter.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Bolstering Hearsay\r\nBrown asserts the trial court erred in \r\n  allowing corroborative testimony from Dr. Smith, Inspector Garrett, and Inspector \r\n  Brothers.Â  He contends their testimony improperly bolstered Victimâ€™s testimony.Â  \r\n  Additionally, he argues the prosecutor personally bolstered Victimâ€™s testimony \r\n  by asking her about prior conversations she had with the prosecutor and Dr. \r\n  Smith.Â  We find no error.\r\nInitially we note Brown did not object \r\n  to any corroborative testimony offered by Inspectors Garrett and Brothers.Â  \r\n  Thus this issue is not preserved as to these grounds.Â  \r\nBrown did object to Dr. Smithâ€™s testimony, but \r\n  the same was permitted under the well-recognized medical diagnosis and treatment \r\n  exception to the hearsay rule.Â  Dr. Smith testified the child reported she was \r\n  repeatedly touched on the breasts, touched on her vagina, and that sometimes \r\n  the vaginal contact hurt.Â  Because this information was necessary for Dr. Smith \r\n  to better assess any mental and physical injury, the testimony was admissible \r\n  under the hearsay exception for statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis \r\n  or treatment.Â  Rule 803(4), SCRE.\r\nIV.Â  Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\r\nBrown contends his conviction should be \r\n  reversed because his trial counsel was ineffective for allowing him to submit \r\n  to a polygraph examination and for failing to accompany him during the examination.\r\nThis court is an appellate court for the correction \r\n  of errors of law committed at the trial level.Â  We do not consider claims of \r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal from convictions.Â  Instead, \r\n  such claims should be brought in a proceeding for post-conviction relief.Â  State \r\n  v. Felder, 290 S.C. 521, 522, 351 S.E.2d 852, 852 (1986) (â€œWithout addressing \r\n  the merits of appellantâ€™s claim, we hold that post-conviction relief rather \r\n  than a direct appeal is the proper avenue of relief in this case.â€).Â  \r\nV.Â  Redirect Examination of Annie Brown\r\nBrown asserts the trial court erred in \r\n  allowing the State to ask Annie leading questions on redirect.Â  We disagree.\r\nOrdinarily, leading questions should not \r\n  be used on direct examination except as necessary to develop the witnessâ€™ testimony.Â  \r\n  Rule 611(c), SCRE.Â  However, â€œ[w]hen a party calls a hostile witness, an adverse \r\n  party, or a witness identified with an adverse party, interrogation may be by \r\n  leading questions.â€Â  Id.Â  Contrary to Brownâ€™s contention that the trial \r\n  court declared Annie a hostile witness, the court clearly indicated it was allowing \r\n  leading questions under Rule 611(c), SCRE because Annie was identified with \r\n  Brown.Â  At the time she testified at trial, Annie had been married to Brown \r\n  for almost twenty years.Â  Given that she was testifying for the State while \r\n  married to the defendant, we find no error in the courtâ€™s conclusion that she \r\n  â€œidentified with an adverse party.â€Â  Id.Â  Accordingly, the trial court \r\n  acted well within its discretion under Rule 611 in allowing the State to elicit \r\n  Annieâ€™s testimony through leading questions.\r\nVI.Â  Cumulative Errors\r\nHaving concluded each of Brownâ€™s issues lack merit, \r\n  we find application of the cumulative error doctrine inappropriate in this case.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF and STILWELL, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-207","title":"State v.

Pachak, Office of Appellate \r\n  Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W.

Morgan, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Appellant was convicted of \r\n  trafficking in methamphetamine and unlawful carrying of a pistol, and he was \r\n  sentenced.Â  On appeal, Appellant argues that the trial court erred in sentencing \r\n  him for second offense trafficking under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(C)(1) when \r\n  his prior drug conviction was for possession of a controlled substance.Â  We \r\n  affirm.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \r\n   \r\nOn December 28, 2001, Appellant, a commercial truck \r\n  driver, was stopped at a weigh station on Interstate 20 in Aiken County, South \r\n  Carolina.Â  Appellant told one of the officers that there was a gun in the cab \r\n  of his truck.Â Â  In addition to a 9 millimeter pistol, the officer discovered \r\n  .11 grams of cocaine and 21.99 grams of methamphetamine in the truck.Â Â  \r\nAppellant was indicted for trafficking in methamphetamine, \r\n  possession of cocaine, and unlawful carrying of a pistol.Â  He was tried on April \r\n  29, 2003 before the Honorable James C. Williams and a jury.Â  \r\nAppellant was convicted of trafficking in methamphetamine \r\n  and unlawful carrying of a pistol and was sentenced.Â  His drug related conviction \r\n  was treated as a â€œsecond offenseâ€ for sentencing purposes, since Appellant had \r\n  a prior conviction from Nevada for possession of a controlled substance.Â  The \r\n  circuit court determined that the conviction would constitute a â€œsecond offenseâ€ \r\n  as defined in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-470, thus rejecting Appellantâ€™s argument \r\n  that the prior conviction had to be a trafficking offense in order to trigger \r\n  the â€œsecond offenseâ€ sentence pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(C)(1)(b).Â  \r\n  This appeal follows.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n   \r\nOn appeal, Appellant argues the circuit court erred \r\n  in sentencing him for second offense trafficking under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(C)(1) \r\n  when his prior drug offense was for possession of a controlled substance.Â  Thus, \r\n  the issue raised on appeal is the characterization of the trafficking conviction \r\n  as a â€œsecond offense.â€Â Â Â  \r\nÂ South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(C) (2003) provides \r\n  that any â€œperson who knowingly sells, manufactures, delivers, purchases, or \r\n  brings into this StateÂ  . . . ten grams or more of ice, crank, or crack cocaine \r\n  . . . is guilty of a felony.â€Â  If the amount is ten grams or more, but less \r\n  than twenty-eight grams, and the conviction is a â€œsecond offenseâ€ as defined \r\n  by statute, the defendant must be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than \r\n  five years nor more than thirty years, and a $50,000 fine.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  44-53-375(C)(1)(b).Â  Under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-470, an offense is considered \r\n  a second offense if the defendant has a prior conviction under Title 44, Article \r\n  53 of the South Carolina Code of Laws, or under â€œany State or Federal statute \r\n  relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana, depressant, stimulant, or hallucinogenic \r\n  drugs.â€Â  \r\nAppellant argues that S.C. Code Â§ 44-53-375(C)(1)(b) \r\n  only applies when the defendantâ€™s prior conviction is a â€œtrafficking offense.â€Â  \r\n  Our court recently rejected this exact argument in State v. Dupree, 354 \r\n  S.C. 676, 583 S.E.2d 437 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  In Dupree, the court noted \r\n  that the language in Â§ 44-53-375(C) â€œmerely delineates offensesâ€ and that there \r\n  is no conflict between Sections 44-53-375(C)(1)(b) and 44-53-470.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  The court concluded by holding that Â§ 44-53-470 applies to Â§ 44-53-375(C).Â  \r\n  Id.Â  \r\nLikewise, inÂ  Thomas v. State, 319 S.C. \r\n  471, 465 S.E.2d 350 (1995), the court held that the marijuana trafficking statute \r\n  and the statute defining â€œsecond or subsequent offenseâ€ as any drug offense \r\n  were part of the same general law and could be read together without conflict.Â  \r\n  The court further noted that â€œ[t]he legislature could not have intended second \r\n  or subsequent offenses under [Â§ 44-53-375(C)(1)] to include only . . . trafficking \r\n  when there is a specific statute which defines second or subsequent offenses \r\n  as any drug offense.â€Â  Id.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThus, pursuant to the holdings in Dupree \r\n  and Thomas, and based on Appellantâ€™s prior conviction for possession \r\n  of a controlled substance, the circuit court properly sentenced him as a second \r\n  time offender under Â§ 44-53-375(C)(1)(b).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HOWARD, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-210","title":"State v.

Anderson, pro se, of Irmo, for Appellant.\r\nPatrick M. Teague, Senior Assistant General Counsel, South \r\n  Carolina Department of Public Safety, of Blythewood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  John M. Anderson was convicted \r\n  in his absence in magistrateâ€™s court for a traffic violation.Â  The circuit court \r\n  affirmed the conviction.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nAppellant received a traffic ticket on June 14, 2001 \r\n  for speeding.Â  He failed to appear at his scheduled hearing, and was tried in \r\n  his absence and found guilty.Â  He received notice of the conviction by mail \r\n  on April 15, 2002.Â Â Â On April 24, 2002, Appellant wrote a letter to the \r\n  traffic court requesting to reopen the case.Â  Although the motion for a new \r\n  trial was untimely, the magistrate scheduled a hearing on Appellantâ€™s motion \r\n  for May 30, 2002.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 22-3-1000 (Supp. 2003) (â€œNo motion for a \r\n  new trial may be heard unless made within five days from the rendering of the \r\n  judgmentâ€).Â  Appellant failed to appear for the May 30 hearing, and the motion \r\n  was denied. \r\nThe essence of the appeal to the circuit \r\n  court and this court is Appellantâ€™s desire for â€œan opportunity to stand in front \r\n  of a judge based on the charges brought against [him].â€Â  While we appreciate \r\n  Appellantâ€™s desire, there is simply no legal basis to afford him relief.Â  The \r\n  record establishes that the magistrateâ€™s office provided proper notice of the \r\n  motion for new trial to Appellant at his correct address. \r\n  [1] Â  Assuming Appellantâ€™s receipt of notice of his conviction on April \r\n  15, 2002 may be liberally construed as the date of â€œrendering of the judgment,â€ \r\n  his new trial motion would nevertheless be untimely pursuant to Section 22-3-1000.Â  \r\n  We additionally note that Appellantâ€™s conclusory brief falls short of the appellate \r\n  court rules.Â  Rule 208 (b)(1)(D), SCACR; see also Fields v. \r\n  Melrose Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 312 S.C. 102, 106, 439 S.E.2d 283, 285 (Ct.

Few, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-216\r\nSubmitted March 8, 2004 â€“ Filed March \r\n  30, 3004\r\n\r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJames Daniel Bailey, of Aiken and Richard Edwin Miley, of \r\n  N. Augusta, for Appellant.\r\nPhillip E. Reeves and Jennifer D. Eubanks, both of Greenville, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Janet Elgin Arthurs, as the \r\n  personal representative of the estate of her deceased mother, Betty B. Stephens, \r\n  appeals from the denial of her post-trial motions for judgment notwithstanding \r\n  the verdict (JNOV), new trial, and to alter or amend the judgment in these actions \r\n  for wrongful death and survival against Sue. H. Brown.Â  We find this court lacks \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction to review the case because the notice of appeal \r\n  was untimely.\r\nFACTS\r\nAt the center of this case is \r\n  a fatal car accident that occurred on Thanksgiving Day in 1998.Â  Stephens was \r\n  traveling in the northbound lane of Highway 19 in Aiken County.Â  Brown was traveling \r\n  on the same road in the southbound lane.Â  As the two vehicles approached each \r\n  other, the car driven by Brown crossed the centerline of the two-lane road and \r\n  collided with Stephensâ€™s car.Â  Stephens died at the scene of the accident.Â  \r\n  Brown survived. \r\nStephensâ€™s daughter brought this \r\n  action against Brown, claiming Brownâ€™s negligence in the operation of her vehicle \r\n  was the proximate cause of her motherâ€™s death.Â  At the conclusion of the trial \r\n  on August 7, 2001, the jury rendered verdicts in favor of Brown.Â  Arthurs then \r\n  made oral motions for JNOV and a new trial.Â  Specifically, she argued there \r\n  was no evidence to support the juryâ€™s conclusions on the issue of negligence \r\n  and that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury on the law of â€œunavoidable \r\n  accidentâ€ as a defense to negligence charges.Â  The circuit court entered an \r\n  order denying these motions on November 19, 2001, which was subsequently received \r\n  by Arthurs on November 27, 2001.Â  Arthurs then filed a motion, dated November \r\n  30, 2001, to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  In \r\n  the motion, Arthurs merely restated the arguments she made orally and in memoranda \r\n  filed with her first post-trial motions and requested the trial court provide \r\n  a â€œfactual or legal basis for denying the Plaintiffâ€™s Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding \r\n  the Verdict and New Trial.â€Â  This motion was denied by the trial court on February \r\n  7, 2002. Â Arthurs served her notice of appeal on March 11, 2002.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAs an initial consideration, \r\n  this court is obligated to evaluate our jurisdiction to hear this matter even \r\n  though neither party raised it as an issue on appeal.Â  See Ness v. \r\n  Eckerd Corp., 350 S.C. 399, 402, 566 S.E.2d 193, 195 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  We \r\n  conclude that the appeal to this court is untimely and, as a result, we lack \r\n  jurisdiction to consider the merits of the case.\r\nAccording to Rule 203(b)(1), SCACR, the notice of appeal \r\n  from a civil action â€œshall be served on all respondents within thirty days (30) \r\n  after receipt of written notice of entry of the order or judgment.â€Â  Timely \r\n  motions for JNOV, to alter or amend the judgment, or for a new trial stay the \r\n  time for appeal until receipt of written notice of entry of the order granting \r\n  or denying the motions.Â  Id.Â  However, a subsequent motion for JNOV, \r\n  to alter or amend, or new trial does not expand the time for appeal when, as \r\n  in the present case, it merely restates the arguments made in previous motions.\r\nThis court recently considered successive \r\n  post-trial motions in Collins Music Co. v. IGT, 353 S.C. 559, 579 S.E.2d \r\n  524 (Ct. App. 2002), cert. denied, 124 S. Ct. 303 (2003).Â  In Collins, \r\n  the jury returned a verdict for Collins, and IGT made timely motions for JNOV, \r\n  new trial, and new trial nisi remittitur.Â  Id. at 560, 579 S.E.2d \r\n  at 524.Â  The court denied all of IGTâ€™s motions and IGT received a copy of the \r\n  order on September 5, 2001.Â  Id.  \r\nOn September 12, 2001, IGT served a motion \r\n  to alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, and the motion merely restated \r\n  the arguments made in the post-trial motions.Â  Collins at 561, 579 S.E.2d \r\n  at 524.Â  IGT received written notice of the entry of the order denying its motion \r\n  to alter or amend on November 5, 2001, and served its notice of appeal on November \r\n  21, 2001.Â  Id.Â Â Â  \r\nThis court held that because IGTâ€™s Rule \r\n  59(e) motion did not raise new issues, but rather restated the arguments made \r\n  in earlier motions, it was not a proper Rule 59(e) motion and thus, did not \r\n  toll the time to serve notice of appeal.Â  Collins, 353 S.C. at 566, 579 \r\n  S.E.2d at 527, (citing Coward Hund Constr. Co. v. Ball Corp., 336 S.C. \r\n  1, 518 S.E.2d 56 (Ct. App. 1999) and Quality Trailer Products, Inc. v. CSL \r\n  Equip. Co., 349 S.C. 216, 562 S.E.2d 615 (2002)).Â  Therefore, because the \r\n  issues raised in IGTâ€™s subsequent motions were ripe for appellate review after \r\n  the courtâ€™s first post-trial ruling, the time to appeal lapsed while IGT awaited \r\n  a ruling on its subsequent Rule 59(e) motion.Â  Id. Â \r\n The facts of the present \r\n  case warrant the same result.Â  Arthurs moved for JNOV and new trial immediately \r\n  following the juryâ€™s verdict on the grounds the evidence did not support the \r\n  juryâ€™s conclusion on the issue of negligence and that the trial court should \r\n  not have instructed the jury on the law regarding the defense of unavoidable \r\n  accident.Â  The trial court denied these motions.Â  Arthurs received a written \r\n  copy of the trial courtâ€™s order denying these motions on November 27, 2001, \r\n  and then moved to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 59(e) on the same groundsâ€”that \r\n  the evidence did not support the juryâ€™s ruling on negligence and that the trial \r\n  court improperly instructed the jury on unavoidable accident.Â  The trial court \r\n  opined that it had â€œagain carefully considered all of Plaintiffâ€™s argumentsâ€ \r\n  and denied the motion. \r\nThe issues raised by \r\n  Arthursâ€™ initial post-trial motions for JNOV and new trial were preserved and \r\n  ripe for appellate review when they were denied by the trial court in November \r\n  2001.Â  Because Arthursâ€™ subsequent Rule 59(e) motion merely restated the arguments \r\n  made in her initial post-trial motions, it did not stay the time to file notice \r\n  of appeal.Â  Therefore, because Arthurs did not file her notice of appeal until \r\n  March 11, 2002, we find the appeal is untimely.\r\nAccordingly, for the \r\n  reasons stated above, the present appeal is\r\n DISMISSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., ANDERSON, \r\n  and BEATTY, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-217","title":"State v.

Richardson, \r\n  Assistant Attorney General David A. Spencer, all of Columbia; and Solicitor \r\n  Robert M. Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  Raymond Robert Berggrum was \r\n  convicted of second-degree burglary and sentenced to ten years imprisonment.Â  \r\n  Berggrum appeals, arguing the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a \r\n  directed verdict.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOfficer Steve Stewart responded to a \r\n  call that a liquor store had been burglarized in the middle of the night.Â  When \r\n  Stewart arrived, he discovered glass on the inside of the door, blood on the \r\n  door, and two broken bottles of Wild Turkey.Â  A second officer, Greg Turner, \r\n  arrived at the scene and noted a Wild Turkey cup â€“ similar to the ones in the \r\n  liquor storeâ€™s display â€“ was on the ground outside the store and had blood on \r\n  it.Â Â Â  \r\nAfter canvassing the area around the store, Stewart \r\n  and Turner went to the Days Inn hotel across the street from the store.Â  They \r\n  questioned the hotelâ€™s night clerk to see if he had noticed anything suspicious.Â  \r\n  After speaking with the clerk, the officers went to Room 109, where they noticed \r\n  blood on the outside of the door.Â  Berggrum answered the door and allowed the \r\n  officers to enter.Â  After the officers noticed a bottle of Wild Turkey on the \r\n  floor, they obtained consent to search the rest of the room.Â  The officers subsequently \r\n  found a second bottle of Wild Turkey and another Wild Turkey cup. [1] Â  They also noticed that Berggrum had two fresh \r\n  scratches on his arm and there was blood on the bedding.Â  \r\nBerggrum gave a statement to Stewart and Turner \r\n  after he was advised of his Miranda \r\n  [2]  rights.Â  The statement contained three different versions of events.Â  \r\n  Initially, Berggrum stated two men came to his hotel room and gave him two bottles \r\n  of Wild Turkey, after which they pointed a gun to his head and told him he owed \r\n  them $2000. Â Then Berggrum stated the liquor store owner gave him the liquor \r\n  with the understanding that he would pay later.Â  Finally, Berggrum said he bought \r\n  the liquor.\r\nAt the close of the Stateâ€™s case, defense counsel \r\n  moved for a directed verdict, arguing there was no substantial circumstantial \r\n  evidence from which â€œa jury may fairly and logically find or render a verdict.â€Â  \r\n  The trial judge denied the motion, and Berggrum was subsequently found guilty \r\n  of second-degree burglary.Â  However, after rendering the verdict, the jury foreman \r\n  stated, â€œ[w]e were very dissatisfied with the evidence even though we did return \r\n  with a guilty verdict.Â  We would let it be known.â€Â  Based in large part upon \r\n  the foremanâ€™s comment, Berggrum moved for a new trial, which was denied.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBerggrum argues the trial judge erred \r\n  in denying his motions for directed verdict and a new trial because there was \r\n  insufficient evidence of guilt.Â  We do not agree.\r\nOn a motion for a directed verdict \r\n  in a criminal case, the trial court is concerned with the existence or non-existence \r\n  of evidence, not its weight.Â  State v. Morgan, 282 S.C. 409, 411, 319 \r\n  S.E.2d 335, 336 (1984).Â  In reviewing a refusal to grant a directed verdict, \r\n  the appellate court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the \r\n  State and determine whether there is any direct or substantial circumstantial \r\n  evidence that reasonably tends to prove the defendant's guilt or from which \r\n  his guilt may be logically deduced. Â State v. Pinckney, 339 S.C. 346, \r\n  349, 529 S.E.2d 526, 527 (2000).Â Â  If the State presents any evidence which \r\n  reasonably tends to prove the defendantâ€™s guilt, or from which the defendantâ€™s \r\n  guilt could be fairly and logically deduced, the case must go to the jury.Â  \r\n  State v. Poindexter, 314 S.C. 490, 493, 431 S.E.2d 254, 255-56 (1993).\r\nAt trial, the State presented substantial \r\n  circumstantial evidence to support the guilty verdict.Â  Berggrumâ€™s hotel room \r\n  was located across the street from the burglarized liquor store.Â  Four bottles \r\n  of Wild Turkey were stolen from the liquor store and police found a total of \r\n  four bottles of Wild Turkey between the liquor store and Berggrumâ€™s hotel room.Â  \r\n  Police also found a Wild Turkey promotional cup â€“ similar to those in the Wild \r\n  Turkey display at the liquor store â€“ in Berggrumâ€™s hotel room.Â  Further, there \r\n  was blood at the liquor store, blood on Berggrumâ€™s hotel room door, blood on \r\n  his hotel bedding, and two fresh scratches on his arm.Â  In addition to this \r\n  circumstantial evidence, Officer Turner testified as to the statement Berggrum \r\n  made after his arrest.Â  After Berggrum was read his Miranda rights, he \r\n  gave three conflicting statements to police about how he came to have two bottles \r\n  of Wild Turkey and a Wild Turkey cup in his hotel room.Â  Viewing the Stateâ€™s \r\n  evidence as a whole, we find the State presented substantial circumstantial \r\n  evidence of Berggrumâ€™s guilt.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial judge did not err in denying \r\n  Berggrumâ€™s motion for a directed verdict and submitting the case to the jury.Â  \r\n  See, e.g., State v. McGowan, 347 S.C. 618, 622, 557 S.E.2d \r\n  657, 659 (2001) (holding that if there is any direct evidence or any substantial \r\n  circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, \r\n  this court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury).Â  Accordingly, \r\n  Berggrumâ€™s conviction and sentence are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J.,Â  and ANDERSON, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The liquor storeowner subsequently verified that four bottles of \r\n    Wild Turkey were missing from the store. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Miranda v.

Myers, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Johnny Brewer was convicted of murder, second-degree arson, and larceny.Â  He was sentenced \r\n  to life imprisonment for murder, twenty-five years imprisonment for second-degree \r\n  arson, and ten years imprisonment for larceny, with the sentences to run consecutively.Â  \r\n  Brewer appeals, arguing the circuit court erred by: 1) determining evidence \r\n  regarding correspondence between Starnes and an inmate who used the defense \r\n  of panic was relevant; and 2) failing to instruct the jury that the State had \r\n  the burden of disproving accident beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nBrewer was indicted for murder, \r\n  second-degree arson, and larceny.Â  At trial, Brewer represented himself.Â  During \r\n  Brewerâ€™s testimony, he admitted he strangled the victim to death, robbed her \r\n  house, and then set her house on fire. \r\nThe State presented evidence Brewer killed the \r\n  victim because she interrupted him while he was searching her house for money \r\n  to pay drug debts.Â  Brewerâ€™s explanation for the crimes was that he had staged \r\n  a robbery and set the victimâ€™s house on fire because he panicked after accidentally \r\n  killing the victim.Â  In response to Brewerâ€™s explanation that his actions were \r\n  motivated by panic, the State asked Brewer about correspondence he had with \r\n  another inmate who had used panic as a defense in a murder trial.Â  Brewer objected \r\n  to this question.Â  The circuit court overruled the objection. \r\nAfter the close of the evidence, Brewer \r\n  requested the circuit court charge the jury on accident and instruct them that \r\n  the State had the burden to disprove his accident defense.Â  The circuit court \r\n  charged the jury on accident but did not instruct them on which party had the \r\n  burden for establishing accident. \r\nBrewer was convicted of murder, second-degree \r\n  arson, and larceny.Â  He was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder, twenty-five \r\n  years imprisonment for second-degree arson, and ten years imprisonment for larceny, \r\n  with the sentences to run consecutively.Â  Brewer appeals.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â Relevant Evidence\r\nBrewer argues the circuit court erred by determining \r\n  evidence regarding correspondence between Brewer and an inmate who used the \r\n  defense of panic was relevant.Â  We disagree.\r\nRelevant evidence is defined as â€œevidence having \r\n  any tendency to make, the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the \r\n  determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be \r\n  without the evidence.â€ Rule 401, SCRE; see Rule 402, SCRE (â€œAll relevant \r\n  evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of \r\n  the United States, the Constitution of the State of South Carolina, statutes, \r\n  these rules [of evidence], or by other rules promulgated by the Supreme Court \r\n  of South Carolina.â€); Rule 403, SCRE (stating relevant evidence may be excluded \r\n  if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice).Â Â  \r\nA ruling by a circuit court concerning the relevance \r\n  of evidence will be disturbed only upon a showing of an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Shuler, 353 S.C. 176, 184, 577 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2003).\r\nDuring direct examination, Brewer admitted strangling \r\n  the victim but stated he did not mean to kill her.Â  He testified that, after \r\n  he killed the victim, he made the scene appear to be a robbery before he set \r\n  the house on fire.Â  On cross, Brewer stated he had covered up the killing because \r\n  he had panicked.Â  He explained he had panicked in the past when faced with a \r\n  situation where someone had died. \r\nIn response to Brewerâ€™s claim that he had panicked \r\n  in this situation as he had done in the past, the State conducted the following \r\n  cross-examination:\r\nSTATE: In fact, Mr. Brewer, since youâ€™ve been acting as your \r\n  own attorney, youâ€™ve been having some correspondence, havenâ€™t you? Youâ€™ve received \r\n  some correspondence, havenâ€™t you?\r\n. . .\r\nSTATE: In fact, some of that mail has come from the law offices \r\n  of Norman Starnes and B.J. Quattlebaum, hasnâ€™t it?\r\nDEFENDANT: I have received a letter from a couple of guys \r\n  that was in the jail who have been convicted.Â  They wrote me a letter back, \r\n  yes.\r\nSTATE: In fact, one of them, Norman Starnes, used the defense \r\n  of: I panicked when I killedÂ  these two guys and buried them out in a field \r\n  and put lime on top of them. Didnâ€™t he? He himself used that defense, didnâ€™t \r\n  he?\r\nBrewer objected, arguing the \r\n  information relating to Starnes was not relevant. The circuit court overruled \r\n  the objection. \r\nThe State sought to introduce the evidence of correspondence \r\n  between Brewer and Starnes to demonstrate that Brewer had recently fabricated \r\n  the defense of accident and panic.Â  Because the testimony regarding the correspondence \r\n  had the tendency to affect the credibility of Brewerâ€™s explanation of why he \r\n  committed the crimes, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by admitting \r\n  the evidence. See Shuler, 353 S.C. at 184, 577 S.E.2d at 442.\r\nStarnes further contends the State presented no \r\n  evidence suggesting Brewer and Starnes colluded to fabricate Brewerâ€™s defense.Â  \r\n  Relying on State v. Bailey, 279 S.C. 437, 308 S.E.2d 795 (1983), Brewer \r\n  argues a baseless allegation is irrelevant and grounds for reversal.\r\nIn Bailey, the defendantâ€™s father and brother \r\n  plotted to procure perjured testimony on the defendantâ€™s behalf. Id. at 440, 308 S.E.2d at 797.Â  Because the defendant had no knowledge of the plan, \r\n  the circuit court ruled the evidence irrelevant because it â€œdid not go to any \r\n  material issue at trial.â€ Id.\r\nHere, Brewer admitted to corresponding with Starnes \r\n  and to knowing about the defenses Starnes used at trial.Â  Unlike Bailey, \r\n  the State was questioning Brewer concerning correspondences in which he was \r\n  involved.Â  Further, the issue involved was a material issue in Brewerâ€™s trial.Â  \r\n  Thus, Bailey is inapplicable to the facts of this case. [1] \r\nII. Jury Charge on Accident\r\nBrewer argues the circuit court erred by failing \r\n  to instruct the jury that the State had the burden of disproving accident beyond \r\n  a reasonable doubt.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe law to be charged to the jury is determined \r\n  by the evidence presented at trial.â€ State v. Lee, 298 S.C. 362, 364, \r\n  380 S.E.2d 834, 835 (1989).Â  â€œThe trial judge should charge only the law applicable \r\n  to the case [because] . . . . [p]roviding instructions to the jury which do \r\n  not fit the facts of the case may tend to confuse the jury.â€ Id. at 364, \r\n  380 S.E.2d at 836 (internal citations omitted).Â  However, â€œa trial court commits \r\n  reversible error if it fails to give a requested charge on an issue raised by \r\n  the evidence.â€ State v. Hill, 315 S.C. 260, 262, 433 S.E.2d 848, 849 \r\n  (1993).\r\nBrewer appeals because, although the circuit court \r\n  gave a charge on accident, it did not instruct the jury regarding which party \r\n  had the burden of establishing accident.Â  We affirm because we hold the evidence \r\n  did not support a charge on accident, and therefore, the sufficiency of the \r\n  accident charge is immaterial.\r\nBrewer requested the following jury charge: â€œ[T]he \r\n  State bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the death of \r\n  [the victim] was not the result of an accident.â€ \r\nBrewer claimed his explanation of how the killing \r\n  occurred supported a charge on accident.Â  At trial, Brewer testified:\r\nIt happened quick.Â  She was pulling, pulling, and I wouldnâ€™t \r\n  stop.Â  I grabbed the phone.Â  [The victim] at that time couldnâ€™t stop me.Â  She \r\n  grabbed the teapot.Â  She swung it at me and I donâ€™t know even where it hit me \r\n  or if it hit me at all.Â  I mean, it was just quick.Â  After that, you know, she \r\n  kept â€“ she kept struggling, you know, swinging at me.Â  As far as the scratches, \r\n  that happened some time during the incident.Â  That was not while I was â€“ I was \r\n  not â€“ I was not on top of her choking her out or nothing like that.\r\nWe struggled and I just held \r\n  her down.Â  I held her down.Â  I had her â€“ I had her neck in my arms.Â  She was \r\n  scratching and clawing.Â  I canâ€™t tell you exactly how it went down as far as \r\n  the fighting on the floor.Â  There was a struggle; it happened quick.Â  Before \r\n  I know it she was â€“ she was dead . . . \r\nâ€œFor a homicide to be excusable on the ground of \r\n  accident, it must be shown that the killing was unintentional, that the defendant \r\n  was acting lawfully, and that due care was exercised [in the use of force].â€ State v. Goodson, 312 S.C. 278, 280, 440 S.E.2d 370, 372 (1994).\r\nBecause Brewer presented no evidence from which \r\n  the jury could have found the victimâ€™s death occurred by accident, a jury charge \r\n  on accident was not warranted. [2] Â  See Lee, 298 S.C. at 364, 380 \r\n  S.E.2d at 835 (â€œThe law to be charged to the jury is determined by the evidence \r\n  presented at trial.â€); see also Goodson, 312 S.C. at 280-81, 440 \r\n  S.E.2d at 372 (holding â€œ[h]omicide is excusable on the ground of accident when \r\n  it appears that the defendant was acting lawfully in self defenseâ€ and the victim \r\n  was killed unintentionally).Â  Therefore, we decline to rule on the sufficiency \r\n  of the accident charge.Â  State v. Aleksey, 343 S.C. 20, 36, 538 S.E.2d \r\n  248, 256 (2000) (holding an appellate court may affirm for any reason appearing \r\n  in the record).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Brewerâ€™s convictions are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHOWARD, KITTREDGE, and CURETON, JJ., concurring.\r\n\r\n [1]  Brewer also argues the Stateâ€™s cross-examination of Brewer concerning \r\n  the correspondence with Starnes penalized Brewer for exercising his right \r\n  to self-representation.Â  To support this claim, Brewer relies on State \r\n    v. Brown, 289 S.C. 581, 590, 347 S.E.2d 882, 887 (1986) (â€œIt is impermissible \r\n  for the State to argue in favor ofÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  guilt . . . based upon the accusedâ€™s \r\n  assertion of a constitutional right.â€).Â  Because this issue was not raised \r\n  to or ruled upon by the circuit court, it is not preserved for appellate review. See Humbert v. State, 345 S.C. 332, 338, 548 S.E.2d 862, \r\n  866 (2001).Â  \r\n [2]  Brewer did not request a jury charge on self-defense.Â  Further, the \r\n  evidence did not establish Brewer believed he was â€œin imminent danger of losing \r\n  his life or sustaining serious bodily injury, or he actually was in such imminent \r\n  dangerâ€ when he killed the victim. Â See Goodson, 312 S.C. at \r\n  280, 440 S.E.2d at 372 (holding for a jury charge of self-defense to be warranted \r\n  â€œthe defendant must have actually believed he was in imminent danger of losing \r\n  his life or sustaining serious bodily injury, or he actually was in such imminent \r\n  dangerâ€).Â  Additionally, Brewer was in the victimâ€™s home at the time of the \r\n  killing. See State v. Chambers, 310 S.C. 43, 44, 425 S.E.2d \r\n  45, 46 (Ct. App. 1992) (holding even a lawful guest has a duty to retreat \r\n  if possible, meaning the guest cannot assert self-defense unless he establishes \r\n  this duty was fulfilled).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-220","title":"State v.

Grate, for Appellant.\r\nArrigo Paul Carotti, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Joseph Grate filed a complaint against Helen Bone, a court \r\n  reporter, concerning a transcript for a hearing.Â  Grate appeals from the circuit \r\n  courtâ€™s order dismissing his complaint. We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\n  \r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nGrate sued Bone for failing to deliver a transcript \r\n  to him, alleging Bone obstructed his access to due process, deprived him of \r\n  speedy access to justice, obstructed justice, and concealed evidence.Â  \r\nBone moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds \r\n  that the complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of \r\n  action in that the complaint failed to allege that Grate paid Bone for the transcript.Â  \r\n  The court granted Boneâ€™s motion. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn deciding whether the circuit court properly granted the \r\n  motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, this court must consider whether \r\n  the complaint, when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, states \r\n  any valid claim for relief.â€ Slack v. James, 356 S.C. 479, 482, 589 S.E.2d \r\n  772, 773 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The circuit court should not grant a motion to dismiss \r\n  if â€œfacts alleged and inferences reasonably deducible therefrom would entitle \r\n  the plaintiff to any relief on any theory of the case.â€ Gentry v.

Â At trial, the \r\n  Stateâ€™s case consisted of the testimony of one witness, Steven Hemingway.Â  Hemingway \r\n  testified that on the night of the altercation, Burrows instigated the fight \r\n  inside the bar.Â  Hemingway testified that once he was outside the bar Burrows \r\n  ran into him with a vehicle before hitting him repeatedly with a two-by-four \r\n  board. \r\nHemingway admitted that he had been drinking the \r\n  night the altercation took place.Â  He also testified he had been displeased \r\n  with Burrows over an incident that happened at his house two weeks prior to \r\n  the altercation. \r\nOn cross-examination, Burrows elicited testimony \r\n  that Hemingway was the larger of the two men, weighing at least fifty pounds \r\n  more than Burrows. \r\nPrior to Burrows taking the stand, the State sought \r\n  to admit several of Burrowsâ€™ prior convictions for impeachment purposes.Â  Burrows \r\n  objected to the admission of his conviction for ABWIK.Â  The circuit court allowed \r\n  the conviction into evidence for impeachment purposes, stating that because \r\n  Burrows was physically smaller than the victim in the prior conviction it was \r\n  probative of the issue of relative size raised in this case. \r\nBurrows testified Hemingway began the altercation \r\n  inside the bar, hitting Burrows across the face with the board.Â  Burrows explained \r\n  he attempted to leave in his vehicle but Hemingway swung the board through his \r\n  window and broke his mirror.Â  Burrows testified he did not start the vehicle \r\n  during the altercation so he could not have hit Hemingway with the vehicle. \r\n\r\nDuring cross-examination, the State established \r\n  that Burrows had been convicted of ABWIK on a previous occasion and that he \r\n  had been smaller than the victim in that case. \r\nBurrows was convicted of the lesser-included offense \r\n  of ABHAN.Â  Burrows was sentenced to ten years imprisonment, suspended on the \r\n  service of six years imprisonment and three years probation.Â  Burrows appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAdmission of evidence falls within the \r\n  circuit courtâ€™s discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent abuse \r\n  of that discretion. State v. Shuler, 353 S.C. 176, 184, 577 S.E.2d 438, \r\n  442 (2003).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is \r\n  based on an error of law.â€ State v. Foster, 354 S.C. 614, 621, 582 S.E.2d \r\n  426, 429 (2003).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nBurrows argues the circuit court erred by admitting \r\n  his prior conviction of ABWIK for impeachment purposes because the circuit court \r\n  failed to correctly apply the factors in State v. Colf, 337 S.C. 622, \r\n  525 S.E.2d 246 (2000).Â  We agree.\r\nRule 609(a)(1), SCRE, requires the circuit court \r\n  to balance the probative value of the evidence for impeachment purposes against \r\n  the prejudice to the accused.\r\nIn determining whether the probative value of a \r\n  prior conviction outweighs its prejudicial effect, a circuit court should consider \r\n  the following factors: â€œ1. [t]he impeachment value of the prior crime; 2. [t]he \r\n  point in time of the conviction and the witnessâ€™s subsequent history; 3. [t]he \r\n  similarity between the past crime and the charged crime; 4. [t]he importance \r\n  of the defendantâ€™s testimony; 5. [t]he centrality of the credibility issue.â€ \r\n  Colf, 337 S.C. at 627, 525 S.E.2d at 248; State v. Martin, 347 \r\n  S.C. 522, 530, 556 S.E.2d 706, 710 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œ[T]his court has implicitly \r\n  recognized the value of these [Colf] factors in making such a determination \r\n  under Rule 609(a)(1).â€).\r\nThe State sought to admit Burrowsâ€™ prior conviction \r\n  for ABWIK, arguing â€œit would indicate to the jury that this defendant is not \r\n  only capable but willing . . . [to commit] a crime of this nature . . . [and \r\n  it] would clearly indicate to the jury that [the disparity in] size isnâ€™t necessarily \r\n  a factor here given that the defendant is predisposed to such crimes.â€Â  Burrows \r\n  argued that the reasons given by the State were the precise reasons the conviction \r\n  should not be admitted.Â  The circuit court found the conviction was admissible \r\n  because the conviction was for an assault of a person of larger stature than \r\n  Burrows, and the disparity in size between Burrows and Hemingway had been raised \r\n  in this case. \r\nâ€œ[W]hen the prior offense is similar to the offense \r\n  for which the defendant is on trial, the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant \r\n  from impeachment by that prior offense weighs against its admission.â€Â  State \r\n  v. Dunlap, 353 S.C. 539, 542, 579 S.E.2d 318, 320 (2003).Â  A prior conviction \r\n  is inadmissible to show the defendant â€œacted in conformity with his prior convictions.â€ \r\n  Â State v. Cheatham, 349 S.C. 101, 108-09, 561 S.E.2d 618, 622 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2002). \r\nIn making its determination, the circuit court failed \r\n  to correctly apply the Colf factors.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s ruling was \r\n  based on one of the Colf factors, â€œ[t]he similarity between the past \r\n  crime and the crime charged.â€ Colf, 337 S.C. at 627, 525 S.E.2d at 248.Â  \r\n  However, instead of displaying concern about the similarity between the prior \r\n  conviction and the alleged crime, the circuit court made this similarity the \r\n  basis for its decision.Â  Specifically, the circuit court found the conviction \r\n  was admissible for the purpose of establishing Burrowsâ€™ propensity to attack \r\n  victims larger than himself. We hold this was error. Id. at 628, 525 \r\n  S.E.2d at 249 (â€œThe trial judge here erred in treating the prior crimes as if \r\n  their similarity heightened their probative value when it actually increased \r\n  their prejudicial effect.â€).\r\nFurther, the error was not harmless because the competent \r\n  evidence put forth to convict Burrows did not conclusively prove his guilt.Â  \r\n  State v. Livingstone, 282 S.C. 1, 6, 317 S.E.2d 129, 132 (1984) (â€œ[W]here \r\n  guilt is conclusively proven by competent evidence and no rational conclusion \r\n  can be reached other than the accused is guilty, a conviction will not be set \r\n  aside because of insubstantial errors not affecting the result.â€).Â  Hemingway \r\n  was the only witness to testify for the State.Â  He admitted to having two or \r\n  three beers on the night of the altercation and to being displeased with Burrows \r\n  over an incident that happened at Hemingwayâ€™s house two weeks prior to the altercation.Â  \r\n  Hemingway testified Burrows instigated the fight inside the bar.Â  He testified \r\n  that once he was outside the bar Burrows ran into him with a vehicle and hit \r\n  him with the board. Â However, Burrows testified Hemingway began the fight.Â  \r\n  Burrows testified he did not drive into Hemingway with his vehicle and he only \r\n  hit Hemingway in response to Hemingwayâ€™s physically aggressive behavior.Â  The \r\n  State did not call the owner of the bar, a person who could have testified as \r\n  to who started the altercation.Â  The State also chose not to call an individual \r\n  who helped break up the fight, a person who could have testified as to whether \r\n  Hemingway had been hit by a vehicle.\r\nUnder these circumstances, we cannot hold beyond a \r\n  reasonable doubt that the affirmative answer to the Stateâ€™s question regarding \r\n  Burrowsâ€™ prior conviction for ABWIK, the same crime for which he was accused \r\n  in this trial, did not irreparably damage Burrowsâ€™ credibility in each jurorâ€™s \r\n  mind. Because the circuit court erred by allowing the prior conviction for ABWIK \r\n  to be use for impeachment purposes, and Burrows was prejudiced by that error, \r\n  we reverse. State v. Harvey, 275 S.C. 225, 227, 268 S.E.2d 587, 588 (1980) \r\n  (holding prejudicial error is grounds for reversal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Burrowsâ€™ conviction is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HOWARD, and KITTREDGE,\r\nJJ., concurring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-223","title":"State v.

White, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM: Â Keith B. Bruce was \r\n  convicted of distribution of marijuana and distribution of marijuana within \r\n  the proximity of school.Â  Subsequently, the circuit court sentenced him to ten \r\n  years imprisonment for distribution of marijuana and fifteen years imprisonment \r\n  for distribution of marijuana within the proximity of a school, the sentences \r\n  to run concurrently.Â  Bruce appeals, arguing the circuit court erred by denying \r\n  his motion for directed verdict.Â  We remand with instructions.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nBruce was indicted for distribution of marijuana \r\n  and distribution of marijuana within the proximity of a school.Â  Subsequently, \r\n  a jury convicted him on both charges, and the circuit court sentenced him to \r\n  ten years imprisonment for distribution of marijuana and fifteen years imprisonment \r\n  for distribution of marijuana within the proximity of a school, the sentences \r\n  to run concurrently.Â  Bruce appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBruce argues the circuit court erred by denying \r\n  his motion for directed verdict.Â  We do not reach this issue, as we remand this \r\n  case for a determination of whether the grand jury true billed his indictments.\r\nThe jurisdiction of a court over the subject matter \r\n  of a proceeding is fundamental.Â  Brown v. State, 343 S.C. 342, 346, 540 \r\n  S.E.2d 846, 848 (2001).Â  Thus, the lack of subject matter jurisdiction can be \r\n  raised at any time, can be raised for the first time on appeal, and can be raised \r\n  sua sponte by the court.Â  State v. Brown, 351 S.C. 522, 525-26, 570 S.E.2d \r\n  559, 560 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nThe circuit court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to convict \r\n  a defendant of an offense unless: 1) there has been an indictment that sufficiently \r\n  states the offense; 2) the defendant has waived presentment of the indictment; \r\n  or 3) the offense is a lesser-included offense of the crime charged in the indictment.Â  \r\n  State v. Primus, 349 S.C. 576, 579, 564 S.E.2d 103, 105 (2002).Â Â  \r\nWhen the action of the grand jury is not written on the indictment, \r\n  and evidence does not exist within the record to indicate the action of the \r\n  grand jury, an appellate court must remand the case to the circuit court for \r\n  a determination of whether the indictment was true billed.Â  See State \r\n  v. Grim, 341 S.C. 63, 67, 533 S.E.2d 329, 330 (2000) (holding where grand \r\n  jury foreman signed and dated the indictment but failed to state the action \r\n  of the grand jury, the appropriate remedy was to remand the case to the circuit \r\n  court for a determination of whether the grand jury true billed the indictment); \r\n  Anderson v. State, 338 S.C. 629, 633, 527 S.E.2d 398, 400 (Ct. App. 2000) \r\n  (same).Â  Furthermore, upon remand, the State bears the burden of proving subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction.Â  See Id.  \r\nIn the present case, the grand jury foreman signed and dated \r\n  both indictments.Â  However, no action of the grand jury is stamped or written \r\n  on either indictment.Â  Furthermore, no evidence exists within the record indicating \r\n  the action of the grand jury.Â  Thus, we remand the case for a hearing on whether \r\n  the circuit court was properly vested with subject matter jurisdiction during \r\n  Bruceâ€™s trial. At the hearing, the State shall bear the burden of proving subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, this case is REMANDED to \r\n  the circuit court, and the appeal is stayed pending resolution of this \r\n  matter.\r\nGOOLSBY, HOWARD, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concurring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-224","title":"State v.

Pachak, Office of Appellate \r\n  Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Attorney General W. Rutledge Martin, all \r\n  of Columbia; and Solicitor Warren B. Giese, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â  Albert Scruggs was \r\n  convicted of second-degree burglary, kidnapping, and assault with intent to \r\n  commit first-degree criminal sexual conduct.Â  The circuit court sentenced him \r\n  to fifteen years imprisonment for second-degree burglary, life imprisonment \r\n  without parole for kidnapping, and life imprisonment without parole for assault \r\n  with intent to commit first-degree criminal sexual conduct, the sentences to \r\n  run concurrently.Â  Scruggs appeals, arguing the circuit court lacked subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction because the Stateâ€™s indictment against him for assault with \r\n  intent to commit first-degree criminal sexual conduct was jurisdictionally defective.Â  \r\n  We remand.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nA grand jury indicted Scruggs for second-degree burglary, \r\n  kidnapping, and assault with intent to commit first-degree criminal sexual conduct.Â  \r\n  During the trial, the State moved to amend the indictment for assault with intent \r\n  to commit criminal sexual conduct, and the circuit court granted the motion.Â  \r\n  Subsequently, Scruggs was convicted on all the charges.Â  Scruggs appeals.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nScruggs argues the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  over his charge for assault with intent to commit first-degree criminal sexual \r\n  conduct because the Stateâ€™s indictment was jurisdictionally defective.Â  \r\nâ€œIssues related to subject matter jurisdiction Search \r\n  Term Begin Search Term End may be raised at any time.â€Â  Carter v. State, \r\n  329 S.C. 355, 362, 495 S.E.2d 773, 777 (1998). A circuit court has subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction if: â€œ(1) there has been an indictment which sufficiently states \r\n  the offense; (2) there has been a waiver of indictment; or (3) the charge is \r\n  a lesser included offense of the crime charged in the indictment.â€Â  Id.Â Â  \r\n  â€œThe true test of the sufficiency of an indictment is not whether it could be \r\n  made more definite and certain, but whether it contains the necessary elements \r\n  of the offense intended to be charged and sufficiently apprises the defendant \r\n  of what he must be prepared to meet.â€Â  Browning v. State, 320 S.C. 366, \r\n  368, 465 S.E.2d 358, 359 (1995).Â  \r\nA circuit court lacks subject matter jurisdiction if the \r\n  indictment fails to allege an essential element of the offense charged.Â  Mathis \r\n  v. State, 355 S.C. 87, 92, 584 S.E.2d 366, 368-69 (2003) (holding where \r\n  Stateâ€™s indictment for first-degree burglary failed to allege an aggravating \r\n  circumstance, the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction).\r\nSouth Carolina Code Annotated section 16-3-652 \r\n  (2003) states a person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree \r\n  if:\r\n\r\nthe actor engages in sexual battery with the victim and if \r\n  any one or more of the following circumstances are proven: (a) The actor uses \r\n  aggravated force to accomplish sexual battery. (b) The victim submits to sexual \r\n  battery by the actor under circumstances where the victim is also the victim \r\n  of forcible confinement, kidnapping, robbery, extortion, burglary, housebreaking, \r\n  or any other similar offense or act.Â  (c) The actor causes the victim, without \r\n  the victimâ€™s consent, to become mentally incapacitated or physically helpless \r\n  by administering, distributing, dispensing, delivering, or causing to be administered, \r\n  distributed, dispensed, or delivered a controlled substance, a controlled substance \r\n  analogue, or any intoxicating substance.\r\n\r\nThe caption for the indictment for assault with intent to \r\n  commit first-degree criminal sexual conduct stated, â€œASSAULT WITH INTENT \r\n  TO COMMIT CRIMINAL SEXUAL CONDUCT, 1ST SC Code:Â  16-3-656, 652(2)[,]â€ \r\n  and the body alleged, â€œTHAT ALBERT SCRUGGS DID IN RICHLAND COUNTY ON OR ABOUT \r\n  JUNE 6, 2002, WILFILLY, UNLAWFULLY, AND FELONIOUSLY ATTEMPT TO COMMIT A SEXUAL \r\n  BATTERY UPON AND WITH THE BODY OF MARGARET LEWIS.â€Â  (emphasis as in original).Â  \r\n\r\nDuring the trial, the State amended the indictment, adding \r\n  the following to its body, \r\n\r\nWITHOUT HER CONSENT.Â  SUCH SEXUAL BATTERY WAS ACCOMPLISHED \r\n  BY THE USE OF AGGRAVATED FORCE TO WIT:Â  THE INTENT TO COMMIT A FELONY AND/OR \r\n  DESPARITY [SIC] BETWEEN THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OF THE PARTIES AND/OR A DIFFERENCE \r\n  IN SEXES AND/OR INDECENT LIBERTIES OR FAMILIARITIES WITH A FEMALE.Â  AND/OR IS \r\n  ALSO THE VICTIM OF FORCEABLE CONFINEMENT, KIDNAPPING, BURGLARY, OR OTHER SIMILAR \r\n  OFFENSE.Â  ALL IN VIOLATION OF SC CODE OF LAWS 16-3-656. AND SC CODE OF LAWS \r\n  16-3-652. \r\n\r\n(emphasis as in original).Â  \r\nThe Stateâ€™s original indictment for assault with intent to \r\n  commit criminal sexual conduct does not state an aggravating circumstance listed \r\n  in section 16-3-652.Â  Thus, the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  on the original indictment.Â  See Mathis, 355 S.C. at 92, 584 S.E.2d \r\n  atÂ  368-69 (holding where Stateâ€™s indictment for first-degree burglary failed \r\n  to allege an aggravating circumstance, the circuit court lacked subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction).Â  Consequently, we must determine if the Stateâ€™s amendment was \r\n  an action by the grand jury, for if it was not, the State could not amend the \r\n  indictment, adding the substantive elements, to vest the circuit court with \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction.Â  See State v. Ervin, 333 S.C. 351, \r\n  356, 510 S.E.2d 220, 223 (Ct. App. 1998) (holding the circuit court may not \r\n  acquire subject matter jurisdiction by permitting the State to amend an otherwise \r\n  jurisdictionally-defective indictment); see also Stirone v. United \r\n  States, 361 U.S. 212, 218 (1960) (â€œThe very purpose of the requirement that \r\n  a man be indicted by grand jury is to limit his jeopardy to offenses charged \r\n  by a group of his fellow citizens acting independently of either prosecuting \r\n  attorney or judge.â€); United States v. McGrath, 558 F.2d 1102, 1105 n. \r\n  3 (2nd Cir. 1977) (â€œThe principal justification for barring amendment by the \r\n  court or prosecutor is the possibility that the Grand Jury might have voted \r\n  no bill on the amended facts. When the amendment is made by the Grand Jury, \r\n  this danger does not exist.â€); 41 Am Jur. 2d Indictments and Informations \r\n  Â§ 173 (1995) (stating an indictment may not be amended except by resubmission \r\n  to the grand jury, unless the change is merely a matter of form). \r\nThe State amended the body of the indictment to allege aggravating \r\n  circumstances.Â  Adjacent to the amended language are the initials, â€œWSSâ€ and \r\n  then the statement â€œAS AMENDED,â€ with a signature, from someone other than the \r\n  person who initialed the amendment, and the date.Â  No evidence exists within \r\n  the record indicating who either initialed or signed the indictmentâ€™s amendment.Â  \r\n  However, neither of the signatures are that of the presiding circuit court judge.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, the State, in its respondentâ€™s brief, contends the amendment could \r\n  have been the foreperson of the grand jury.Â  \r\nGiven the record before us, we cannot determine whether the \r\n  grand jury approved the amended language of the indictment.Â  Thus, we remand \r\n  this matter to the circuit court for a factual determination as to whether the \r\n  amendment was submitted to the grand jury.Â  See State v. Grim, \r\n  341 S.C. 63, 67, 533 S.E.2d 329, 330 (2000) (holding where indictment did not \r\n  disclose if it was true-billed, the appropriate remedy was to remand the case \r\n  to the circuit court).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, this appeal is REMANDED \r\n  to the circuit court.\r\nGOOLSBY, HOWARD, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concurring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-227","title":"State v.

Summer, Jr., Faye A. Flowers, both of Columbia. \r\n  for Appellants.\r\nE. Katherine Wells, of Columbia; Michael A. Molony and Stephen \r\n  L. Brown, both of Charleston; Douglas Jennings, Jr., of Bennettsville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Marlboro Park Hospital and \r\n  Chesterfield General Hospital (Hospitals) appeal the circuit courtâ€™s decision \r\n  affirming the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control \r\n  Boardâ€™s (the DHEC Board) grant of a certificate of need to Doctorâ€™s Outpatient \r\n  Surgical Clinic (DOSC), which reversed the decision of a South Carolina Administrative \r\n  Law Judge (ALJ) denying the certificate.Â  On appeal, the Hospitals argue the \r\n  circuit court erred in (1) affirming the DHEC Boardâ€™s de novo review \r\n  of the ALJâ€™s decision; and (2) finding that the ALJ improperly considered evidence \r\n  not presented at a preceding Staff Review Hearing conducted by the South Carolina \r\n  Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC).Â  We agree and reverse, \r\n  finding the DHEC Board erred in using a de novo standard of review rather \r\n  than one requiring substantial evidence.Â  Additionally, we find that substantial \r\n  evidence supports the decision of the ALJ. We further find that the ALJ properly \r\n  considered evidence not presented to DHEC in a preceding Staff Review Hearing \r\n  because the evidence was related to issues presented during that hearing.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we reverse and remand to the circuit court to reinstate the decision of the \r\n  ALJ.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nDOSC filed its application for a certificate of \r\n  need with DHEC in 1988, seeking to construct an ambulatory surgery center in \r\n  Bennettsville.Â  The Hospitals opposed the application.Â  \r\nDHEC conducted a Staff Review Hearing on the application \r\n  during which both parties presented information supporting their respective \r\n  positions.Â  In particular, the Hospitals argued that the proposed outpatient \r\n  surgery center would adversely impact the Hospitals and need for the center \r\n  was insufficient.Â  DHEC recommended approval of the application for the certificate \r\n  of need.\r\nThe Hospitals requested a contested case hearing \r\n  before the ALJ.Â  The ALJ conducted a hearing over a seven-day period, during \r\n  which both sides presented evidence and testimony from eighteen witnesses.Â  \r\n  After making findings of fact, the ALJ concluded the application did not meet \r\n  the legal criteria for approval of the certificate of need.Â  The ALJâ€™s decision \r\n  was based in part on the lack of need of a facility and in part on the negative \r\n  impact the facility would have on the Hospitals.\r\nDOSC appealed this decision to the Board.Â  \r\n  In a hearing lasting a little over one hour, the DHEC Board heard oral arguments \r\n  from both parties.Â  It subsequently issued its order reversing the order of \r\n  the ALJ and granting the certificate of need.Â  The Board set forth its own findings \r\n  of fact that contradicted many of the ALJâ€™s findings.\r\nThe Hospitals appealed to the circuit \r\n  court, which affirmed the Boardâ€™s decision.Â  The Hospitals subsequently filed \r\n  a motion for reconsideration, which the circuit court denied.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe Boardâ€™s Standard of Review\r\nThe Hospitals argue the Board improperly \r\n  found facts according to its own view of the evidence utilizing a de novo \r\n  standard.Â  We agree.\r\nThe ALJ presides over all hearings of contested \r\n  DHEC permitting cases.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-600(B) (Supp. 2002).Â  \r\n  In such cases, the ALJ serves as the finder of fact.Â  Brown v. S.C. Depâ€™t \r\n  of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 512, 560 S.E.2d 410, 413 (2002).Â  \r\n  On appeal of such a contested case, a reviewing tribunal â€œmust affirm the ALJ \r\n  if the findings are supported by substantial evidence, not based on the [Boardâ€™s] \r\n  on view of the evidence.â€Â  Dorman v. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, \r\n  350 S.C. 159, 166, 565 S.E.2d 119, 123 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Here, DHECâ€™s Board \r\n  undisputedly sat in an appellate capacity when reviewing the ALJâ€™s decision.Â  \r\n  We find that the DHEC board erred by applying a de novo standard of review \r\n  rather than a â€œsubstantial evidenceâ€ standard. \r\n  [1] \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  ALJâ€™s Consideration of New Evidence\r\nThe Hospitals further assign error to \r\n  the DHEC Boardâ€™s determination, with which the circuit court concurred, that \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-210(E) (Supp. 2000) confines contested hearings before \r\n  the ALJ to the exact evidence considered during the preceding Staff Review Hearing.Â  \r\n  We agree with this assignment of error.\r\n The DHEC Board held that the ALJ erred \r\n  in considering evidence not presented during the Staff Review Hearing, all of \r\n  which undisputedly related to core issues addressed during that hearing. [2] Â  Relying on S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-210(E), the \r\n  Board stated that â€œparties are not allowed to submit new or additional facts \r\n  for consideration at the contested case hearing which were not part of the administrative \r\n  record at the time of the [DHEC Staff Review Hearing.]â€ \r\n  [3] Â  We find the DHEC Boardâ€™s interpretation of Section 44-7-210(E) erroneous.\r\nâ€œThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is \r\n  to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intent whenever possible.â€Â  Strother \r\n  v. Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, 62, 504 S.E.2d 117, \r\n  121 (1998).Â  â€œAll rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one \r\n  that the legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered \r\n  in the language used, and that language must be construed in the light of the \r\n  intended purpose of the statute.â€Â  Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, \r\n  Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994).Â  The words of the statute \r\n  must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or \r\n  forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation.Â  Hitatchi \r\n  Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992).Â  \r\n\r\nHere, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-210(E) states â€œ[t]he \r\n  issues considered at the contested case hearings are limited to those \r\n  presented or considered during the staff review and decision process.â€Â  (emphasis \r\n  added).Â  However, DHECâ€™s Board expansively interpreted the statute to preclude \r\n  the ALJ in contested hearings from receiving any evidence not presented \r\n  to DHEC during a Staff Review Hearing.Â  We reject this interpretation, finding \r\n  it conflicts with the plain language of the statute and the ordinary meaning \r\n  of the word â€œissuesâ€ as used in this context.\r\nAdditionally, the interpretation advanced \r\n  by the DHEC Board and circuit court is inconsistent with applicable case law \r\n  providing a de novo review for ALJ hearings conducted in a posture similar \r\n  to that in the case at bar.Â Â  See Brown, 348 S.C. at 512, 560 \r\n  S.E.2d at 413 (noting that when reviewing a contested case on appeal, the ALJ \r\n  conducts a de novo hearing with the presentation of evidence and testimony.).Â  \r\n  A trial de novo is one in which â€œthe whole case is tried as if no trial \r\n  whatsoever had been had in the first instance.â€Â  Blizzard v. Miller, \r\n  306 S.C. 373, 375, 412 S.E.2d 406, 407 (1991).Â Â  Moreover, when reviewing a \r\n  contested case on appeal, â€œ[t]he ALJ, as the fact-finder, must make sufficiently \r\n  detailed findings supporting the denial [or grant] of a permit application.â€Â  \r\n  Converse Power Corp. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 350 \r\n  S.C. 39, 46, 564 S.E.2d 341, 345 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œDetailed findings enable \r\n  [an appellate court] to determine whether such findings are supported by the \r\n  evidence . . . .â€Â  Id.Â  Here, because the ALJ was conducting a de \r\n  novo hearing, we find that he properly considered the evidence presented \r\n  in his pursuit to make â€œsufficiently detailed findingsâ€ of fact for subsequent \r\n  review.Â  \r\nBased on our interpretation of the unambiguous \r\n  language in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-210(E) (Supp. 2000) and case law providing \r\n  the ALJ a de novo review in contested hearings arising from a DHECâ€™s \r\n  Staff Review Hearing, we conclude that the DHEC Board erred in expanding the \r\n  term â€œissuesâ€ to include â€œevidence.â€Â  In light of the DHEC Board error, we consequently \r\n  find that the circuit court erred in its acquiescence to the DHECâ€™s Board position.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Substantial Evidence\r\nThe Hospitals contend there was substantial \r\n  evidence to support the ALJâ€™s finding that the certificate of need should be \r\n  denied.Â  In particular, they maintain substantial evidence was presented to \r\n  show the proposed facility would adversely impact the two existing facilities \r\n  and the need for a new facility was insufficient.Â  Consequently, based upon \r\n  the credible evidence as determined by the ALJ, the application \r\n  would not comply with the State Health Plan, thus requiring a denial of the \r\n  permit by DHEC.Â  We agree.\r\nUnder S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-210(C) (2002), DHEC must \r\n  deny a Certificate of Need if an application does not comply with the State \r\n  Health Plan.Â  Under the applicable State Health Plan, approval of an ambulatory \r\n  surgical facility requires that six certain criteria must be met.Â  These criteria \r\n  include proof of a documented need for the facility and a discussion on the \r\n  impact on existing facilities.Â  The State Health Plan also ranked nine criteria \r\n  to be considered while reviewing DOSCâ€™s application.Â  The nine criteria in order \r\n  of importance to DHEC are need, community need documentation, distribution (accessibility), \r\n  acceptability, efficiency, adverse effect on other facilities, record of the \r\n  Applicant, ability to complete the project, and financial feasibility. [4] \r\nAs previously discussed, review of the ALJâ€™s factual \r\n  determinations is measured by the substantial evidence standard.Â  Substantial \r\n  evidence is not merely a scintilla of evidence, nor is it evidence viewed blindly \r\n  from one side.Â  Leventis v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, \r\n  340 S.C. 118, 130, 530 S.E.2d 643, 650 (2000)Â Â  Instead, substantial evidence \r\n  is evidence that, in light of the whole record, allows reasonable minds to reach \r\n  the reviewing tribunalâ€™s conclusion.Â  Id.Â  Here, the Hospitals, as the \r\n  moving parties, bore the burden of proving that DOSCâ€™s requested certificate \r\n  of need should be denied.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-210(E) (Supp. 2000) \r\n  (â€œThe burden of proof in a reconsideration or contested case hearing must be \r\n  upon the moving party.â€).Â  \r\nThe ALJ found the Hospitals adequately demonstrated \r\n  that the proposed facility would have a significant adverse impact on the two \r\n  Hospitals and that there was not sufficient need demonstrated to justify the \r\n  new facility.Â  Given evidence presented at the ALJ hearing regarding the lack \r\n  of full utilization of the Hospitalsâ€™ current facilities, the probability that \r\n  the new facility will not be able to recapture enough patients to meet its projections, \r\n  and the result that patients would be taken from the Hospitals, we find substantial \r\n  evidence existed in the record before the ALJ to support the ALJâ€™s decision \r\n  denying the certificate of need.Â  We do recognize the evidence to the contrary.Â  \r\n  But, as noted, the appropriate standard of review precludes a de novo \r\n  review on appeal.Â  Where, as here, reasonable minds could reach the same decision \r\n  as the ALJ, that decision is supported by substantial evidence.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the forgoing reasons, the decision \r\n  of the circuit court is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the circuit \r\n  court to reinstate the decision of the ALJ. \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE, J., and CURETON, A.J., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We are well aware that the DHEC Boardâ€™s brazen attitude \r\n    and utter disregard for the proper standard of review created the procedural \r\n    chaos that followed.Â  The parties, in their respective filings with the Board, \r\n    conceded that the substantial evidence standard governed the review of the \r\n    ALJâ€™s factual determinations.Â  In defiance of the partiesâ€™ concession and \r\n    applicable law, the DHEC Board made its own findings of fact, and unapologetically \r\n    refused to consider the entire record developed in the contested hearing before \r\n    the ALJ. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Two core issues addressed in DHECâ€™s Staff Review Hearing \r\n    addressed (1) whether there was sufficient need for the proposed facility, \r\n    and (2) the extent to which, if any, the proposed facility would have an adverse \r\n    impact on the Hospitals.Â Â  The ALJ considered evidence related to these issues, \r\n    including the following evidence not presented during the preceding Staff \r\n    Review Hearing:Â  (1) expert testimony regarding need and adverse impact of \r\n    the center because the experts were hired subsequent to the hearing; (2) the \r\n    Hospitalsâ€™ Joint Annual Reports;Â  (3) 1997 outmigration data compiled by the \r\n    Budget and Control Board; and (4) information on the impact of the federal \r\n    1997 Balanced Budget Actâ€™s reduction in payments to health care providers.Â  \r\n    This evidence dealt squarely with the issues before the ALJ.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  The circuit court did not specifically address this issue in oral \r\n    arguments, its subsequent written order, or in response to the Hospitalsâ€™ \r\n    motion for reconsideration.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  \r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The State Health Plan also adds:Â  â€œ[DHEC] will continue to evaluate \r\n    applications for ambulatory surgery centers on their individual merit.Â  However, \r\n    it is the determination of [DHEC] that the benefits of improved accessibility \r\n    will not outweigh the adverse affects caused by the duplication of existing \r\n    services or equipment.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-229","title":"State v.

Shupe, of Columbia; and Solicitor Randolph \r\n  Murdaugh, III, of Hampton, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Andre D. Skanes was \r\n  convicted of first-degree burglary and armed robbery and sentenced to eighteen \r\n  years imprisonment on each charge, the sentences to run concurrently.Â  Skanes \r\n  appeals, arguing the circuit court erred by admitting evidence in violation \r\n  of the hearsay rule.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn the night of June 4, 2000, two individuals forced \r\n  their way into the home of Oscar Lopez and Odis Javier Reyes.Â  Upon entry, the \r\n  intruders demanded money from the two victims at gunpoint.Â  \r\nThe following day, Sharon Bryan Evans was arrested in connection \r\n  with the crimes.Â  During questioning, Evans identified Skanes as an accomplice.Â  \r\n  As a result, Skanes was arrested and indicted for first-degree burglary and \r\n  armed robbery.Â Â Â  \r\nAt trial, the State called Evans to the stand, and \r\n  Evans identified Skanes as a participant in the robbery.Â  Subsequently, the \r\n  State called Officer Samuel Roser, who testified he had interviewed Evans following \r\n  her arrest.Â  Roser further testified that as a result of the interview, Skanes \r\n  was identified as Evansâ€™ co-defendant.Â  Skanes did not object to this testimony. \r\n\r\nThereafter, the State asked Roser if Evans identified \r\n  Skanes during the interview.Â  Skanes objected, arguing the testimony was hearsay.Â  \r\n  The circuit court overruled the objection and allowed the testimony. \r\nThe State also presented the testimony of Reyes, \r\n  one of the two victims.Â  Lopez, the other victim, was unavailable for trial.Â  \r\n  Reyes testified in general about the events that took place the night of the \r\n  robbery.Â  During cross-examination of Reyes, Skanes admitted the police photographic \r\n  lineup into evidence in which his picture appeared with photographs of similar-looking \r\n  people.Â  Reyesâ€™ signature appeared on the back of a picture of another person \r\n  in the lineup, indicating Reyes had identified someone other than Skanes as \r\n  the perpetrator.Â  Reyesâ€™ misidentification was brought out through Skanesâ€™ \r\n  examination of Reyes and Officer Roser, who presented the lineup to Reyes.Â  \r\n  However, Lopezâ€™s signature also appeared on the back of the photographic lineup, \r\n  but was on the photo of Skanes. \r\nThe State called Officer Robert Arbello, the police \r\n  officer who had presented the photographs to Lopez, to explain Lopezâ€™s signature \r\n  on the back of the lineup.Â  Skanes objected, arguing the testimony would be \r\n  hearsay.Â  Â The State countered Skanes had opened the door to the explanation \r\n  of Lopezâ€™s signature by admitting the photograph containing the signature into \r\n  evidence and publishing it to the jury.Â  The circuit court agreed and admitted \r\n  the testimony.Â  Arbello then testified that when he presented the lineup to \r\n  Lopez, Lopez identified Skanes as the perpetrator, thus explaining Lopezâ€™s signature \r\n  on the back of Skanesâ€™ photograph.\r\nThe jury found Skanes guilty of both charges, and \r\n  the circuit court sentenced Skanes to eighteen years imprisonment on each charge, \r\n  the sentences to run concurrently.Â  Skanes appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Pre-Trial Identification\r\nSkanes argues the circuit court committed reversible \r\n  error by admitting Roserâ€™s testimony, indicating Evans identified Skanes as \r\n  her accomplice following her arrest.Â  Skanes contends the trial court committed \r\n  reversible error by admitting this hearsay testimony in violation of Rule 802, \r\n  South Carolina Rules of Evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe admission or exclusion of evidence is within \r\n  the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed on appeal absent \r\n  an abuse of that discretion.â€ State v. Foster, 354 S.C. 614, 620-21, \r\n  582 S.E.2d 426, 429 (2003). Â An abuse of discretion occurs when the circuit \r\n  courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law.Â  Id.\r\nâ€œâ€˜Hearsayâ€™ is a statement, other than one made \r\n  by the declarant, while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence \r\n  to prove the truth of the matter asserted.â€Â  Rule 801(c), SCRE; see State \r\n  v. Townsend, 321 S.C. 55, 59, 467 S.E.2d 138, 141 (Ct. App. 1996) (holding \r\n  hearsay is defined as an out of court statement offered to prove the truth of \r\n  the matter asserted). Furthermore, â€œ[h]earsay is not admissible except as provided \r\n  by these rules or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court of this State \r\n  or by statute.â€Â  Rule 802, SCRE.\r\nHowever, error in the admission of evidence, without more, \r\n  is insufficient to reverse a jury verdict, unless the additional element of \r\n  prejudice is demonstrated.Â  State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 \r\n  S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985).Â  Whether improperly admitted evidence is prejudicial \r\n  must be determined from its relationship to the entire case.Â  Id.Â  Thus, \r\n  improperly admitted hearsay evidence is not prejudicial where it is merely cumulative \r\n  to other evidence.Â  State v. Blackburn, 271 S.C. 324, 329, 247 S.E.2d \r\n  334, 337 (1978); cf. State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 124, \r\n  551 S.E.2d 240, 246 (2001) (â€œErroneously admitted corroboration testimony is \r\n  not harmless merely because it is cumulative. On the contrary, â€˜it is precisely \r\n  this cumulative effect which enhances the devastating impact of improper corroboration.â€™â€) \r\n  (internal citations omitted).\r\nAt trial, Evans identified Skanes as her accomplice in committing \r\n  the robbery.Â  Skanes did not object to her in-court identification.Â  Subsequently, \r\n  the State called Roser to the stand.Â  Roser testified he interviewed Evans, \r\n  and as a result of that interview, Skanes was identified as Evansâ€™ co-defendant.Â Â  \r\n  Skanes did not object to this testimony.Â  \r\nThereafter, the State asked Roser if, during his interview \r\n  with Evans, she identified her accomplice in committing the robbery.Â  Skanes \r\n  objected, arguing the testimony would be hearsay, and the circuit court overruled \r\n  the objection.\r\nEven assuming the evidence was hearsay, we conclude the evidence \r\n  was cumulative and thus not prejudical because the substance of Roserâ€™s testimony \r\n  was already presented without objection through both his and Evansâ€™ previous \r\n  testimony.Â  See State v. Crawley, 349 S.C. 459, 466, 562 S.E.2d \r\n  683, 687 (Ct. App. 2002) (holding the circuit court did not commit reversible \r\n  error by permitting alleged hearsay testimony, where substance of alleged hearsay \r\n  testimony was previously admitted without objection).Â  Thus, we hold the circuit \r\n  court did not commit reversible error.Â Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Photographic \r\n  Lineup\r\nSkanes argues the circuit court erred by permitting \r\n  the State to introduce testimony explaining Lopezâ€™s signature on the back of \r\n  the lineup, especially where, as here, Lopez was unavailable and could not be \r\n  cross-examined.Â  Skanes contends this testimony was hearsay in violation of \r\n  Rule 802, South Carolina Rules of Evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œ[W]hen a party introduces evidence about a particular \r\n  matter, the other party is entitled to explain it or rebut it, even if the latter \r\n  evidence would have been incompetent or irrelevant had it been offered initially.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Beam, 336 S.C. 45, 52, 518 S.E. 2d 297, 301 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\n  Furthermore, â€œ[a] party cannot complain of prejudice from the admission of evidence \r\n  if he opened the door to its admission.â€Â  State v. Dunlop, 346 S.C. 312, \r\n  325-26, 550 S.E.2d 889, 897 (Ct. App. 2001); Beam, 336 S.C. at 53, 518 \r\n  S.E.2d at 301 (â€œA party may not complain of error caused by his own conduct.â€). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n During Skanesâ€™ cross-examination of Reyes, Skanes \r\n  admitted the photographic lineup into evidence, with Lopezâ€™s signature on the \r\n  back.Â  The lineup was then published to the jury.Â  No evidence exists within \r\n  the record indicating Skanes attempted to redact Lopezâ€™s name from the lineup \r\n  prior to its admission into evidence and publication to the jury.Â \r\n\r\nSubsequently, the State moved to reopen its case to explain \r\n  the presence of Lopezâ€™s signature on the back of the admitted lineup.Â  Skanes \r\n  objected, arguing the testimony would be hearsay.Â  The circuit court overruled \r\n  his objection and admitted the testimony.Â  Thereafter, Arbello testified when \r\n  he showed the lineup to Lopez, Lopez identified Skanes as the perpetrator and \r\n  signed the back of the lineup. \r\nWe conclude the circuit court did not err by admitting Arbelloâ€™s \r\n  testimony.Â  Once Skanes admitted the lineup with Lopezâ€™s signature on the back \r\n  into evidence, the door was opened allowing testimony to explain the signatureâ€™s \r\n  presence.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Skanesâ€™ convictions \r\n  are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HOWARD, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
