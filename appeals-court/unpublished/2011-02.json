Dunson total temporary\r\n  disability benefits under the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Act.Â  Lee argues\r\n  the Appellate Panel erred in finding Dunson's injury compensable because the\r\n  injury did not arise out of Dunson's employment with Lee.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nLee argues Dunson's injury\r\n  resulted from an idiopathic fall caused by a pre-existing breakdown in his\r\n  knee, and Dunson provided only speculative and thus insubstantial evidence he\r\n  tripped over rubber patches in Lee's parking lot.Â  We disagree.Â  An appellate court can reverse the Appellate Panel's\r\n  decision if it is clearly erroneous.Â  Pierre v. Seaside Farms, Inc., 386\r\n  S.C. 534, 540, 689 S.E.2d 615, 618 (2010) (citations omitted); see also S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5)(d)-(e) (Supp. 2009).Â  A decision is not clearly\r\n  erroneous if it is supported by substantial evidence, and &quot;[s]ubstantial\r\n  evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, but evidence which, considering\r\n  the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the\r\n  agency reached.&quot; Â Tennant v. Beaufort Cnty. Sch. Dist., 381 S.C.\r\n  617, 620, 674 S.E.2d 488, 490 (2009) (citation omitted). Â &quot;Of\r\n  course, the necessary requirements for compensation\r\n  may be established by circumstantial evidence.&quot;Â  Bagwell v. Ernest\r\n    Burwell, Inc., 227 S.C. 444, 450, 88 S.E.2d 611, 613 (1955) (citation\r\n  omitted).Â  \r\n&quot;A claimant\r\n  may recover workers' compensation benefits if he sustains an 'injury by\r\n  accident arising out of and in the course of employment.'&quot;Â  Pierre,\r\n  386 S.C. at 541, 689 S.E.2d at 618 (quoting\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160(A) (Supp. 2009)).Â  &quot;An\r\n  accident arises out of the employment when the accident happens because of the\r\n  employment, as when the employment is a contributing proximate cause.&quot; Â Id.

Wal-Mart Store, Inc.,\r\n  330 S.C. 489, 493, 499 S.E.2d 253, 256 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nHere, Dunson provided substantial evidence his injury arose\r\n  out of his employment. Â Dunson fractured his kneecap because he fell to the\r\n  ground while walking from his company truck across the company parking lot to\r\n  an area where hand trucks were kept.Â  He provided direct and circumstantial\r\n  evidence he injured his knee while tripping over the rubber patches in the\r\n  truck parking lot.Â  Although Dunson initially did not know why he fell, he\r\n  subsequently discovered two rubber pothole patches on the ground in his path to\r\n  the hand trucks and believed he tripped over those patches.Â  Moreover, he told a\r\n  responding insurance adjuster that his knee did not give way, and medical\r\n  testimony established the character of Dunson's injury did not suggest the fall\r\n  resulted from a pre-existing breakdown of the knee.Â  Consequently,\r\n  Dunson provided substantial evidence the injury was neither idiopathic nor\r\n  caused by a pre-existing weakness in his knee, and therefore, the Appellate\r\n  Panel's decision was not speculative.Â  Accordingly, the Appellate Panel\r\n  properly awarded Dunson total temporary disability benefits.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and\r\n  LOCKEMY, JJ., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-039","title":"Chevrolet v.

Goldstein, of Charleston, for\r\n          Appellant.\r\n        Stephanie Pendarvis McDonald and Robin L.\r\n          Jackson of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  On appeal, Azalea Motors, LLC, (Azalea) argues\r\n  the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on its claim for gross\r\n  negligence against the South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles (the\r\n  Department).Â  Specifically, Azalea asserts the trial court erred in concluding\r\n  the Department was neither liable under the public duty rule nor owed a &quot;special\r\n  duty&quot; to Azalea when the Department issued a South Carolina certificate of\r\n  title upon the presentment of a counterfeit Wisconsin certificate of title\r\n  bearing a vehicle identification number of a non-stolen vehicle.\r\nIn support of its argument, Azalea\r\n  contends the Department's failure to utilize a digital blue microscope to\r\n  ascertain the authenticity of the counterfeit Wisconsin certificate of title\r\n  constituted a breach of its duty of care pursuant to section 56-19-40 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (2006).Â  Additionally, Azalea asserts the trial court erred in concluding the\r\n  Department did not violate sections 56-19-260 and 56-19-270 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (2006).Â  In support of this argument, Azalea contends the trial\r\n  court erred by concluding (1) the Department properly issued a South Carolina\r\n  certificate of title when the Department conducted a National Crime Information\r\n  Center database search, which did not indicate the vehicle was stolen and (2)\r\n  the Department was obligated to issue the South Carolina certificate of title\r\n  when the Department's clerk did not have any &quot;reasonable grounds&quot; to\r\n  believe the counterfeit Wisconsin certificate of title contained a fraudulent\r\n  or false statement.Â  Rather, Azalea contends the Department has a duty to\r\n  examine certificate of titles. \r\nAs an additional\r\n  ground for granting summary judgment in favor of the Department, the trial\r\n  court concluded Azalea's claim was also barred pursuant to the South Carolina\r\n  Tort Claims Act.Â  Azalea failed to appeal this ruling.Â  As a result, we affirm\r\n  the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the Department pursuant\r\n  to Rule 220 (b)(1), SCACR, and the following authority: Jones\r\n    v. Lott, 387 S.C. 339, 346, 692\r\n  S.E.2d 900, 903 (2010) (&quot;Under the two issue rule, where a decision is\r\n  based on more than one ground, the appellate court will affirm unless the\r\n  appellant appeals all grounds because the unappealed ground will become the law\r\n  of the case.&quot;).Â  \r\nAccordingly, the trial court's\r\n  decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS, PIEPER, and KONDUROS,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-040","title":"State v.

Elliott, Office of the Attorney General, of Columbia, for Respondent(s).\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Appellant, Joshua S. Weatherford, was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to eight\r\n  years imprisonment. Weatherford appeals, asserting the trial judge erred\r\n  in denying his motion for directed verdict arguing there was no direct or\r\n  substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove he killed the\r\n  victim, Mallory Jordan.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\n1. In regard to his argument that the\r\n  trial court erred in denying his motion for directed verdict we note, when\r\n  ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with\r\n  the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.Â  State v. Weston,\r\n  367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006). Further, our standard of review\r\n  provides, when reviewing a denial of a directed verdict, this court must view\r\n  the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the State.Â  Id.Â  If there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial\r\n  evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, we must find the\r\n  case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  Id. at 292-93, 625 S.E.2d at\r\n  648.Â  The State presented the following substantial circumstantial evidence of\r\n  guilt: Â evidence of the location in which the gun was found and the improbable,\r\n  to impossible, explanation of Weatherford's mother that the gun flew from\r\n  Jordan's hand; inconsistencies in information from Weatherford's mother\r\n  provided to the police regarding Jordan's position when he allegedly shot\r\n  himself as well as how the gun could be found so far from the victim; evidence\r\n  of the unnatural location of the wound and direction in which the bullet went\r\n  through the brain indicating it was most probably a homicide, and the\r\n  pathologist's determination all the circumstances pointed to the victim not\r\n  having done it to himself and concluding to a reasonable degree of medical\r\n  certainty the manner of death was homicide;Â  evidence that only Weatherford and\r\n  his mother were present with Jordan when he suffered the fatal injury; and\r\n  evidence from the expert witness testimony of Agent Simmons that her analysis\r\n  of the three gunshot residue kits was most consistent with Weatherford having\r\n  fired a weapon.Â  This evidence, when viewed collectively, presented a jury\r\n  question as to Weatherford's guilt.Â  Both the law governing directed verdicts\r\n  and our standard of review compel this court to consider only whether the State\r\n  presented sufficient evidence from which a jury could fairly and logically\r\n  deduce Weatherford's guilt.Â  Although Weatherford was able to present evidence\r\n  in contradiction to, or at least possibly explaining, some of the State's\r\n  evidence, the trial court was concerned with the existence or non-existence of\r\n  evidence, not its weight, and the question is not whether there was evidence\r\n  from which the jury could have concluded Weatherford was not guilty, but\r\n  whether there was any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to\r\n  prove Weatherford's guilt.Â  Because we find that there was, the case was\r\n  properly submitted to the jury.\r\n2. As to Weatherford's argument that\r\n  there is no evidence of the sudden heat of passion necessary for voluntary\r\n  manslaughter, and it was therefore error for the trial judge to instruct the\r\n  jury on voluntary manslaughter, we find this argument is not preserved for our\r\n  review.Â  First, appellant's statement of issue on appeal states only that\r\n  &quot;[t]he trial judge erred in denying defense counsel's motion for a\r\n  directed verdict, as there was no direct evidence or substantial circumstantial\r\n  evidence reasonably tending to prove that Weatherford had killed Mallory Jordan.&quot;Â \r\n  It does not mention any error in the submission of a voluntary manslaughter\r\n  charge, nor does it propose error based upon lack of evidence of the &quot;heat\r\n  of passion&quot; element of voluntary manslaughter.Â  Rule 208, SCACR, governing\r\n  the content of appellate briefs, provides specifically as to the statement of\r\n  issues on appeal that the appellant's brief contains &quot;A statement of each\r\n  of the issues presented for review&quot; and that &quot;[t]he statement shall\r\n  be concise and direct as to each issue,&quot; and &quot;[o]rdinarily, no point\r\n  will be considered which is not set forth in the statement of the issues on\r\n  appeal.&quot;Â  Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR.Â  See also State v.\r\n    Culbreath, 377 S.C. 326, 332, 659 S.E.2d 268, 271 (Ct. App. 2008) (noting,\r\n  in order for an issue to be properly presented for appeal, the appellant's\r\n  brief must set forth the issue in the statement of issues on appeal).Â  Â Â Further, Weatherford never raised the argument to\r\n  the trial court that there was no evidence of heat of passion such that it was\r\n  error to charge voluntary manslaughter to the jury.Â  See Jones v.\r\n    Lott, 387 S.C 339, 346, 692 S.E.2d 900, 903 (2010) (holding issues and\r\n  arguments are preserved for appellate review only when they are raised to and\r\n  ruled on by the lower court).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and LOCKEMY, JJ., and\r\n  GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-041","title":"State v.

Mark Stokes, of North Charleston, for Appellant.\r\n        Paul E. Tinkler, and Joshua P. Stokes, of Charleston, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Mary Hadwin brought suit against Ocean\r\n  Air Repair and Construction, Inc., (Ocean) and David W. Linker, for breach of\r\n  contract, and a violation of section 33-14-101(4) of the South Carolina Code (2006),\r\n  as well as an attempt to pierce Ocean's corporate veil.Â  The trial court\r\n  granted partial summary judgment in Hadwin's favor for $455,559.00.Â  We\r\n  reverse.[1]Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nLinker\r\n  incorporated Ocean in 1999.Â  He employed Hadwin, his mother-in-law, as a\r\n  bookkeeper.Â  Between April 2001 and March 2004, Hadwin wrote approximately forty\r\n  checks to Ocean, in various amounts, totaling $358,450.Â  From June 2001 to May\r\n  2006, Ocean wrote a series of checks to Hadwin for a total amount of $119,150.Â  \r\n In\r\n  2008, Hadwin brought this action, alleging her payments to Ocean were loans,\r\n  and demanding repayment.Â  Ocean denied the allegations, asserting as defenses:\r\n  (1) the payments were investments, (2) the statute of limitations, and (3) the statute\r\n  of frauds.Â  \r\n The\r\n  trial court granted partial summary judgment for Hadwin, finding: (1) the\r\n  payments made by Hadwin to Ocean were loans, not investments; and therefore,\r\n  Hadwin was entitled to repayment; (2) Ocean's affirmative defense of the statute\r\n  of frauds failed as a matter of law, and (3) Ocean's affirmative defense of the\r\n  statute of limitations failed as a matter of law.Â  Ocean appeals.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing a grant of summary\r\n  judgment, this court applies the same standard as the trial court, and summary\r\n  judgment shall be proper when there exists no issue of material fact and the\r\n  moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â \r\n  In making this determination the evidence and all reasonable inferences\r\n  therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Law\r\n    v. S.C. Dep't of Corrs., 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648 (2006).Â \r\n  Summary judgment is a drastic remedy, &quot;[t]he purpose of [which] is to\r\n  expedite the disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact\r\n  finder.&quot; Singleton v. Sherer, 377 S.C. 185, 198, 659 S.E.2d 196,\r\n  203 (Ct. App. 2008) (internal quotations omitted).Â  To overcome summary\r\n  judgment in cases applying the preponderance of the evidence burden of proof,\r\n  the non-moving party need only present a scintilla of evidence creating a\r\n  genuine issue of material fact.Â  Zurich Am. Ins. Co. v. Tolbert, 387\r\n  S.C. 280, 283, 692 S.E.2d 523, 524 (2010); Hancock v. Mid-South Mgmt. Co., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803 (2009).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOcean argues the trial court erred, as a\r\n  matter of law, in granting summary judgment.[2]Â \r\n  We agree.\r\nIn this case, the trial court ruled:\r\n\r\n  Defendants allege that the payments into\r\n    the account were not loans, but instead were investments by Plaintiff [(Hadwin)]\r\n    in the company.Â  However, the affidavit for Defendant David Warren Linker . . .\r\n    in opposition to the motion indicated that these deposits were\r\n    &quot;advances.&quot;Â  An advance is a loan.Â  See RIM Assocs. v.\r\n      Blackwell, 359 S.C. 170, 182, 597 S.E.2d 152, 159 (Ct. App. 2004).Â \r\n    Moreover, Defendant Linker reveals in his affidavit that he intended to\r\n    reorganize the corporation to grant stock to Plaintiff.Â  There is no indication\r\n    in the affidavit, however, that stock was ever issued.Â  Accordingly, a finder\r\n    of fact could come to no other conclusion than the deposits Plaintiff made into\r\n    the corporate account were loans and not investments of equity.Â  It thus\r\n    appears that Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment on the issue.Â Â  \r\n\r\nIn\r\n  his affidavit, Linker stated; &quot;at times the company needed infusions of\r\n  cash which the Plaintiff advanced to the company strictly as an\r\n  investment in the business.&quot; (emphasis added)Â  Ocean maintains the trial\r\n  court looked at this term in isolation rather than in context, asserting that\r\n  the evidence shows a disputed issue of material fact as to whether the payments\r\n  to Ocean were intended as a loan or investments.Â  \r\nGenerally,\r\n  courts are bound by a duty to interpret words and terms in context, rather than\r\n  in isolation.Â  See, e.g., Jackson v. Charleston School Board, 316\r\n  S.C. 177, 181, 447 S.E.2d 859, 861 (1994) (recognizing that when interpreting a\r\n  statute, a court should view the language in context, not in isolation); Shultz\r\n    v. Barr, 186 S.C. 498, 502, 196 S.E. 177, 179 (1938) (pointing out that\r\n  when interpreting terms in a will, words must be construed in the context of\r\n  how they are used rather than in isolation); State Accident Fund v. S.C.\r\n    Second Injury Fund, 388 S.C. 67, 75, 639 S.E.2d 441, 445 (Ct. App. 2010)\r\n  (indicating that when interpreting the terms of a contract the &quot;court must\r\n  examine the entire contract&quot; not merely certain phrases in isolation).Â \r\n  Thus, to the extent a trial court relies on a term in isolation, it fails to\r\n  view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\r\nFurther,\r\n  when a motion for summary judgment is made and properly supported, the\r\n  non-moving party &quot;may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his\r\n  pleadings, but his response, by affidavits . . . must set forth specific facts\r\n    showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.&quot;Â  Rule 56(e), SCRCP\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  \r\nHadwin asserts that Linker's affidavit\r\n  provided no more evidence than that supplied in Ocean's answer; thus, Ocean\r\n  failed to meet its burden.Â  While we must agree that the burden is on Ocean to\r\n  rebut Hadwin's evidence, Ocean's position is premised upon an oral agreement.Â  Evidence\r\n  of this oral agreement was presented by way of an affidavit.Â Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the case at bar, Ocean presented evidence by way of Linker's affidavit,\r\n  creating a dispute as to the parties' intentions and understanding.Â  Based on\r\n  our standard of review, when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable\r\n  to Ocean, it raises an issue of fact sufficient to overcome summary judgment.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, the trial court's grant of partial summary judgment is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nSHORT, THOMAS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n[2] Ocean does not challenge the trial court's ruling on\r\n  the defenses of statute of frauds and statute of limitations; therefore, the\r\n  only issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred in finding the payments\r\n  were loans as a matter of law and in granting summary judgment.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-045","title":"Vaughn v.

(Father) appeals the family\r\n  court's final order terminating his parental rights to his minor child (Child).Â  Father contends the family court erred in finding (1) he failed to\r\n  visit Child; (2) he failed to support Child; and (3) termination of parental\r\n  rights (TPR) was in Child's best interests.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nThe\r\n  grounds for TPR must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Dep't\r\n    of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  &quot;Upon review, the appellate court may make its own finding from the\r\n  record as to whether clear and convincing evidence supports the termination [of\r\n  parental rights].&quot;Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C.\r\n  602, 609, 582 S.E.2d 419, 423 (2003).Â  However, despite our broad scope of\r\n  review, we are not required to disregard the findings of &quot;the family\r\n  court, who saw and heard the witnesses, [and] was in a better position to\r\n  evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their\r\n  testimony.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The family\r\n  court may order TPR upon finding one or more of eleven statutory grounds is\r\n  satisfied and also finding TPR is in the best interest of the child.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570 (2010).Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find clear and convincing evidence supports the family court's findings that\r\n  Father willfully failed to visit Child.[2]Â  See Â§ 63-7-2570(3).Â  Here, Father visited Child on only two occasions\r\n  after he moved out of state shortly after the divorce.Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc.\r\n    Servs. v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 53, 413 S.E.2d 835, 839 (1992) (&quot;Conduct\r\n  of the parent which evinces a settled purpose to forego parental duties may\r\n  fairly be characterized as 'willful' because it manifests a conscious\r\n  indifference to the rights of the child to receive support and consortium from\r\n  the parent.&quot;).Â  Accordingly, the family court properly found sufficient\r\n  statutory grounds to terminate Father's parental rights.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn a\r\n  TPR case, the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration.Â  S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Smith, 343 S.C. 129, 133, 538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2000).Â  &quot;The interests of the child shall\r\n  prevail if the child's interest and the parental rights conflict.&quot; Â S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2620 (2010).Â  \r\nWe find clear and convincing evidence in the record\r\n  supports the family court's finding that termination of Father's parental\r\n  rights was in Child's best interests.Â  Although Father expressed good\r\n  intentions during the TPR hearing, he has made little affirmative effort to support\r\n  Child and only visited Child twice after moving out of state.Â  In contrast, Huss\r\n  F. (Grandfather) is providing a stable and loving environment for Child, and\r\n  the guardian ad litem stated Child was well-adjusted and bonded with\r\n  Grandfather.Â  Additionally, Grandfather expressed a strong interest in adopting\r\n  Child, and terminating Father's parental rights would allow the adoption\r\n  process to proceed.Â  See Doe v. Roe, 386 S.C. 624, 634, 690\r\n  S.E.2d 573, 579 (2010) (&quot;Overturning the family court's decision to\r\n  terminate [parent's] rights clearly conflicts with the TPR statute's purpose to\r\n  make a child eligible for adoption by someone 'who will provide a suitable home\r\n  environment and the love and care necessary for a happy, healthful, and\r\n  productive life.'&quot; (quoting Â§ 63-7-2510 (2010))).Â  Accordingly, the family\r\n  court correctly determined TPR was in Child's best interests.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J., HUFF and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Because we find Father willfully failed to visit\r\n  Child, we need not address the remaining statutory ground for TPR.Â  See Stinecipher\r\n    v.

Edwards (Husband) appeals the family court's denial of his Rule 60, SCRCP\r\n  motion.Â  Husband argues the family court erred in denying his motion because:\r\n  (1) a portion of the family court's final order dated October 26, 2006 was void\r\n  for lack of subject matter jurisdiction; (2) his motion was timely; and (3) it\r\n  is inequitable to require him to make monthly equitable distribution payments\r\n  for the remainder of his life and after his death without the ability to modify\r\n  the payments.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\n1. As to\r\n  whether a portion of the family court's\r\n  final order dated October 26, 2006 was void for lack of subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction:Â  Husband's case concerns issues of spousal support and the\r\n  equitable division of marital property, and the family court exercises\r\n  exclusive jurisdiction over both issues.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-3-530\r\n  (2010) (&quot;The family court has exclusive jurisdiction . . . to hear and\r\n  determine actions for divorce a vinculo matrimonii, separate support and\r\n  maintenance, legal separation, and in other marital litigation between the\r\n  parties, and for settlement of all legal and equitable rights of the parties in\r\n  the actions in and to the real and personal property of the marriage.&quot;).Â  \r\n2. As to whether\r\n  Husband's Rule 60 motion was untimely: Husband did not make his motion in a\r\n  reasonable amount of time after the family court's final order.Â  See Rule\r\n  60(b), SCRCP (stating a motion to void a judgment &quot;shall be made within a\r\n  reasonable amount of time . . . after the judgment, order, or proceeding was\r\n  entered.&quot;).Â  Husband failed to file a motion to void the alimony terms\r\n  until eighteen months after the final order despite (1) testifying at the\r\n  hearing that he agreed with the terms of the settlement agreement; and (2) being\r\n  aware of the finalized terms when the family court approved the settlement\r\n  agreement on October 26, 2006.Â  Accordingly, the family court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion in finding Husband's Rule 60 motion was untimely.Â  See McDaniel\r\n  v.

(Mother) appeals from the family court's final order terminating her\r\n  parental rights to her minor child (Child), arguing the family court erred in\r\n  finding termination of parental rights (TPR) was in the best interest of\r\n  Child.Â  The family court cited three statutory grounds for termination: (1)\r\n  failure to remedy condition that caused removal, (2) Mother has a diagnosable\r\n  condition unlikely to change in a reasonable time, and (3) Child has been in\r\n  foster care for fifteen of the last twenty-two months.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nMother contends the family\r\n  court erred in terminating her parental rights because DSS failed to prove by\r\n  clear and convincing evidence that TPR was in the best interest of Child.Â \r\n  Specifically, Mother contends TPR was one of several options that could provide\r\n  stability for Child and that it is too severe a solution to the situation.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe grounds for TPR must be\r\n  proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v.\r\n  Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  &quot;Upon\r\n  review, the appellate court may make its own finding from the record as to\r\n  whether clear and convincing evidence supports the termination [of parental\r\n  rights].&quot;Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 609,\r\n  582 S.E.2d 419, 423 (2003).Â  However, despite our broad scope of review, this\r\n  court is not required to disregard the findings of &quot;the family court, who\r\n  saw and heard the witnesses, [and] was in a better position to evaluate their\r\n  credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The family court may order\r\n  TPR upon finding one or more of eleven statutory grounds is met and TPR is in\r\n  the child's best interests.&nbsp; S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570 (2010). &nbsp;The best interests of the child are the\r\n  paramount consideration.Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Smith, 343 S.C.\r\n  129, 133, 538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  &quot;The\r\n  interests of the child shall prevail if the child's interest and the parental\r\n  rights conflict.&quot; Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2620 (2010).\r\nWe hold the family court\r\n  correctly found termination of Mother's parental rights was in Child's best\r\n  interest.Â  Although Mother seems to be making progress in dealing with her\r\n  psychiatric issues and expresses a strong desire to maintain the parent-child\r\n  relationship, Child would be best served by the stability offered by TPR.Â  To\r\n  date, Mother has had very little contact with Child, who has lived with his\r\n  maternal aunt most of his life.Â  Furthermore, the record indicates Mother's\r\n  ability to live independently and properly care for a child is limited and not\r\n  likely to change in the foreseeable future. The need for stability and\r\n  permanence in Child's life would be in his best interest.Â  These considerations\r\n  and Child's guardian ad litem's opinion that TPR would best serve Child further\r\n  convince us that it is in the best interest of Child to terminate Mother's\r\n  parental rights.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS and\r\n  KONDUROS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-051","title":"SCDSS v.

Mallon, 381 S.C. 417, 434, 673 S.E.2d 448, 457\r\n  (2009).Â  &quot;An abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is based on an\r\n  error of law or a factual conclusion that is without evidentiary support.Â  Â Â Â Â . . . To warrant reversal based on the admission\r\n  or exclusion of evidence, the appellant must prove both\r\n  the error of the ruling and the resulting prejudiceÂ Â Â  . . . .&quot;Â  Fields v. Reg'l Med. Ctr.\r\n    Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 26, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005) (internal citations\r\n  omitted).\r\nThe Williamsons\r\n  contend the master erred in excluding three newspaper articles from evidence that\r\n  contained statements of county employees.Â  They argue the articles are not\r\n  hearsay because they were not offered for their truth, but rather as proof that\r\n  the County acted in bad faith and abused its discretion in deciding to condemn\r\n  their property.Â  Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the\r\n  truth of the matter asserted.Â  Rule 801(c), SCRE.Â  This case presents us with a\r\n  double hearsay situation.Â  To illustrate, &quot;(county employee statements)&quot;\r\n  are the first level of hearsay and &quot;The witness said . . .&quot; is the\r\n  second level of hearsay.[1]Â  \r\nConsequently, for the\r\n  newspaper articles to be admissible, after determining whether each level is\r\n  actually hearsay, we must assess whether each level falls within an exception\r\n  to the hearsay rule.Â  See Bain v. Self Mem'l Hosp., 281 S.C. 138,\r\n  145, 314 S.E.2d 603, 608 (Ct. App. 1984) (&quot;[T]he general rule is that\r\n  hearsay included within hearsay is not excluded if each part of the combined\r\n  statements falls within some exception.&quot;).Â  The actual out-of-court\r\n  statements made by county employees concerning the condemnation decision are\r\n  the first level, and we conclude are not hearsay because they are admissions by\r\n  a party opponent under Rule 801(d)(2)(A), (C), or (D), SCRE.Â  The second level\r\n  is the statement by the newspaper asserting that a witness made a statement;\r\n  therefore, these are offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted and\r\n  constitute hearsay.Â  Because they do not fall within any hearsay exception, the\r\n  master was correct to exclude them.\r\nII.&nbsp; The\r\n  Condemnation Decision\r\nThe Williamsons\r\n  contend the County abused its discretion in determining that it needed a boat\r\n  landing on the South Fork of the Edisto River and that it acted in bad faith.Â  &quot;[T]he\r\n  decision of the question of necessity lies with the one to whom the state has\r\n  delegated the authority to take property for a public use and is not subject to\r\n  review by the court in the absence of fraud, bad faith, or abuse of\r\n  discretion.&quot;Â  Atkinson v. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co., 239 S.C.\r\n  150, 158-59, 121 S.E.2d 743, 747 (1961).Â  Accordingly, judicial review of a\r\n  legislative condemnation decision such as the one in this case is deferential.Â \r\n  However, our review of the circuit court's decision is not deferential.Â  See Fox v. Moultrie, 379 S.C. 609, 613, 666 S.E.2d 915, 917&nbsp;(2008) (&quot;In\r\n  an action in equity,\r\n  tried with reference to a master, this Court reviews the\r\n  evidence and determines the facts according to its own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence . . . .&quot;).Â  In this\r\n  case, the County conducted a survey to assess need and location preference and\r\n  chose a boat landing which already existed, had been regularly utilized by its\r\n  citizens for thirty years, could be put to use immediately, and presented\r\n  minimal costs.Â  We give due deference to the County's decision to condemn and\r\n  find that it neither abused its discretion nor acted in bad faith.Â Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT and\r\n  WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] For example, one statement from an article was:\r\n  &quot;But Haydel said the law gives public bodies, such as council, the right\r\n  to take private property as long as it is for public use.&quot;Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-053","title":"SCDSS v.

Murray appeals the circuit\r\n  court's denial of his petition for a writ of mandamus and dismissal of his\r\n  action, arguing the circuit court erred in: (1) denying his request for a tape\r\n  of the PCR hearing based on an impermissible form of hybrid representation; and\r\n  (2) denying his petition for writ of mandamus.Â  Additionally, Murray contends\r\n  his PCR appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to subpoena the court\r\n  reporter for a copy of the tape.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\n1.&nbsp; As to whether the circuit court\r\n  erred in denying Murray's request for a tape of the PCR hearing based on an\r\n  impermissible form of hybrid representation:Â  Murray made an invalid pro se\r\n  request for the tape of the PCR hearing because the Office of Appellate Defense\r\n  represented him at that time for purposes of his PCR appeal.Â  Because Murray\r\n  was represented by counsel at the time of the request, any request for the tape\r\n  was required to be made by counsel.Â  See State v. Stuckey, 333\r\n  S.C. 56, 58, 508 S.E.2d 564, 564 (1998) (&quot;[Because] there is no right to\r\n  hybrid representation, substantive documents filed pro se by a person\r\n  represented by counsel are not accepted unless submitted by counsel.&quot;).Â  Â Â Â Â \r\n2.&nbsp; As to whether the circuit court\r\n  erred in denying Murray's petition for writ of mandamus:Â  Murray did not\r\n  demonstrate he lacked a legal remedy to challenge the accuracy of the PCR\r\n  transcript because he could have timely made a request through his appellate\r\n  counsel under Rule 607(i), SCACR.Â  See Wilson v. Preston, 378\r\n  S.C. 348, 354, 662 S.E.2d 580, 583 (2008) (&quot;To obtain a writ of mandamus\r\n  requiring the performance of an act, the petitioner must show: (1) a duty of\r\n  respondent to perform the act; (2) the ministerial nature of the act; (3) the\r\n  petitioner's specific legal right for which discharge of the duty is necessary;\r\n  and (4) a lack of any other legal remedy.&quot;).Â  Accordingly, the circuit\r\n  court correctly denied Murray's petition for writ of mandamus.\r\n3.&nbsp; As\r\n  to whether Murray's PCR appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to\r\n  subpoena the court reporter for a copy of the tape:Â  Murray's claims of ineffective\r\n  assistance of counsel are better suited for post-trial conviction relief\r\n  proceedings.Â  See State v.

Toal, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Alan Wilson, Chief Deputy Attorney General John\r\n  W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant\r\n  Attorney General Deborah R.J. Shupe, Office of the Attorney General, of\r\n  Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Russell Campbell, Jr. appeals from the trial court's\r\n  denial of his motion for\r\n  judgment notwithstanding the verdict, a new trial, and sentence\r\n  reconsideration.Â  Campbell argues the trial court erred in: (1) allowing the\r\n  admission of expert opinion testimony; (2) not\r\n  dismissing the indictment for\r\n  obtaining money or other property; (3) not charging the incontestability\r\n  insurance statute; and (4) not directing a verdict for Campbell.Â  We affirm.[1]Â \r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nThe\r\n  Richland County Grand Jury indicted Campbell for obtaining property by false\r\n  pretenses and making a false statement or misrepresentation.Â  The indictments\r\n  alleged Campbell provided false information on an application for life\r\n  insurance for Russell Campbell, Sr., Campbell's father (Father), with the\r\n  intent to defraud Auto-Owners Life Insurance Company (Auto-Owners).Â  The State\r\n  asserted Campbell signed the applications.Â  Father lived two years and eight\r\n  months after the issuance of the policy, and upon his death, Campbell received\r\n  $50,159.74.\r\nPrior\r\n  to trial, Campbell moved to quash the indictment alleging he obtained property\r\n  by false pretenses on the ground that a life insurance policy is not money,\r\n  valuable security, chattel, or real or personal property.Â  The State asserted\r\n  Campbell not only obtained the policy and collected the proceeds after Father's\r\n  death, but the policy itself was a valuable security because other companies\r\n  purchase life insurance policies before the death of the insured.Â  The court\r\n  denied Campbell's motion, finding the broad statutory language encompassed the\r\n  right to receive benefits from a life insurance policy.Â  At the conclusion of\r\n  the State's case, Campbell moved for a directed verdict on both charges,\r\n  arguing (1) there was no evidence the Auto-Owners' policy had any cash value at\r\n  the time the company issued the policy; (2) the State could not rely on the\r\n  fact that Campbell received the policy proceeds because the policy was\r\n  incontestable under state law; and (3) the policy's effective date preceded the\r\n  application date, thus Auto-Owners did not rely on it to issue the policy.Â  The\r\n  court denied the motion, finding the evidence went beyond mere conjecture or\r\n  suspicion, and there was evidence that reasonably tended to prove Campbell's\r\n  guilt.\r\nAfter\r\n  a three-day trial, the jury found Campbell guilty of both charges.Â  The court\r\n  sentenced Campbell to three years imprisonment and ordered him to pay\r\n  $50,159.74 in restitution for the charge of making a false statement or\r\n  misrepresentation, and ten years imprisonment, suspended on the service of\r\n  three years with five years' probation for the charge of obtaining property by\r\n  false pretenses.Â  Campbell\r\n  filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, a new trial, and\r\n  sentence reconsideration.Â  The court denied Campbell's motion.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court\r\n  sits to review errors of law only and is bound by the trial court's factual\r\n  findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C.\r\n  1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  Thus, on review, the appellate court is limited\r\n  to determining whether the trial judge abused his discretion.Â  Id. Â An\r\n  abuse of discretion occurs when the court's decision is unsupported by the\r\n  evidence or controlled by an error of law.Â  State v. Garrett, 350 S.C.\r\n  613, 619, 567 S.E.2d 523, 526 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Expert Opinion\r\nCampbell\r\n  argues the trial court erred in allowing expert opinion testimony by the investigating officer\r\n  because it was hearsay.Â  We disagree.\r\nJoe Jordan, an officer with the State Law Enforcement Division,\r\n  testified he learned in his investigation that the insurance companies would\r\n  not have issued the policies if they had known Father's true medical\r\n  condition.Â  He also testified he sent copies of the application to the\r\n  handwriting analysis unit and learned the signature on the application belonged\r\n  to Campbell.Â  Campbell objected on the ground of hearsay.Â  However, the court\r\n  held matters learned in the course of an investigation were admissible.\r\nRule 801(c), SCRE, defines hearsay as &quot;a statement, other\r\n  than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing,\r\n  offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.&quot; Â See State v. Vick, 384 S.C. 189, 199, 682 S.E.2d 275, 280 (Ct. App. 2009) (stating\r\n  the &quot;rule against hearsay prohibits the admission of evidence of an out of\r\n  court statement by someone other than the person testifying[,] which is used to\r\n  prove the truth of the matter asserted&quot;); but see State v. Thompson,\r\n  352 S.C. 552, 558, 575 S.E.2d 77, 81 (Ct. App. 2003) (holding an out of court\r\n  statement is not hearsay if it is offered for the limited purpose of explaining\r\n  why a government investigation was undertaken). Â Â \r\nAssuming without deciding that Jordan's testimony was hearsay, &quot;the\r\n  improper admission of hearsay testimony constitutes reversible error only when\r\n  the admission causes prejudice.&quot;Â  Vick, 384 S.C. at 199, 682 S.E.2d\r\n  at 280.Â  &quot;Error is harmless when it could not reasonably have affected the\r\n  result of the trial.&quot; Â Id.Â  &quot;[T]he admission of improper\r\n  hearsay evidence is harmless where the evidence is merely cumulative to other\r\n  evidence.&quot;Â  Id. at 199-200, 682 S.E.2d at 280.\r\nScott\r\n  Brown, assistant manager at Auto-Owners, testified\r\n  that Auto-Owners issues a policy if all the medical questions on the\r\n  application are answered &quot;no,&quot; and denies the application if any of\r\n  the answers are &quot;yes.&quot;Â  A forensic handwriting expert also testified he examined the\r\n  signature on the Auto-Owners application and determined Campbell &quot;probably&quot;\r\n  signed Father's name as the proposed insured.Â  Therefore, we find Jordan's\r\n  testimony was merely cumulative to the other evidence presented at trial, and\r\n  any error in allowing the admission of Jordan's testimony was harmless.\r\nII.&nbsp; Indictment\r\nCampbell\r\n  argues the court erred in not dismissing the indictment for obtaining money or other property because a\r\n  life insurance policy is not property.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe indictment\r\n  reads: &quot;Campbell, Jr. did in Richland County on or about July 11, 2002,\r\n  with intent to cheat and defraud the victim, Auto-Owners Life Insurance\r\n  Company, obtain a life insurance policy on his father, Russell Campbell, Sr.,\r\n  valued at more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), by means of false\r\n  pretenses and false representations.Â  This is in direct violation of Â§\r\n  16-13-240 of the South Carolina Code of Laws (1976), as amended.&quot;Â  Section\r\n  16-13-240 of the South Carolina Code makes it a crime for any person to obtain\r\n  from another person by false pretense or representation &quot;any chattel,\r\n  money, valuable security, or other property, real or personal, with intent to\r\n  cheat and defraud a person of that property.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-240\r\n  (2003).Â  \r\nAt\r\n  trial, Campbell moved to dismiss the indictment for obtaining property by false\r\n  pretenses on the ground that a life insurance policy is a chose in action, not\r\n  real or personal property.Â  The State argued Campbell received the policy and\r\n  the money from the policy, and the policy itself was a valuable security\r\n  because other companies purchase life insurance policies before the death of\r\n  the insured.Â  The court denied Campbell's motion, finding the broad definition\r\n  of property includes the right to receive insurance benefits.\r\nIn\r\n  support of his argument that choses in action are not considered property,\r\n  Campbell cites to Brown v. Brown, 279 S.C. 116, 302 S.E.2d 860 (1983), and Tiffault v. Tiffault, 303 S.C. 391, 401 S.E.2d 157 (1991).Â  In Tiffault,\r\n  the court overruled Brown and held that vested military retirement\r\n  benefits constitute property, which is subject to equitable distribution.Â  303\r\n  S.C. at 392, 401 S.E.2d at 158.Â  Further, in Ball v. Ball, 312 S.C. 31,\r\n  33-34, 430 S.E.2d 533, 534-35 (Ct. App. 1993), this court, in determining that nonvested\r\n  pension rights are marital property, held South Carolina courts construe the\r\n  term &quot;property&quot; very broadly, and it &quot;is a general term that is\r\n  used to designate a right of ownership and it includes every subject of\r\n  whatever nature upon which the right of ownership can legally attach, including\r\n  choses in action.&quot;Â  Thus, our courts have determined choses in action are\r\n  property, and we find the court did not err in denying Campbell's motion to\r\n  dismiss the indictment for obtaining property by false pretenses.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Insurance Application\r\nCampbell\r\n  argues the court erred in failing to direct a verdict because the insurance company issued the policy\r\n  prior to the date of the alleged fraudulent application, and thus, the\r\n  application could not form the basis for the fraudulent intent to receive a\r\n  policy.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of\r\n  evidence, not its weight, when ruling on a motion for a directed verdict.Â  State\r\n    v. Brannon, 388 S.C. 498, 501, 697 S.E.2d 593, 595 (2010).Â  The defendant\r\n  is entitled to a directed verdict if the State fails to produce evidence of the\r\n  offense charged.Â  Id.Â  &quot;When reviewing a denial of a directed\r\n  verdict, this court views the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the\r\n  light most favorable to the nonmoving party.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nCampbell\r\n  asserts the application for insurance was dated July 11, 2002, yet the policy was issued on June 28, 2002.Â  Therefore, Campbell maintains the application, dated\r\n  after the insurance company issued the policy, could not have affected the\r\n  company's decision to issue the policy.\r\nCampbell\r\n  contacted an insurance agent on June 28, 2002, to purchase a life insurance\r\n  policy on Father.Â  Campbell sought to purchase a term life insurance policy,\r\n  but the agent mistakenly sent him an application for whole life insurance.Â \r\n  Brown testified the company received the application for whole life insurance\r\n  from Campbell via facsimile on June 28, 2002, and the original document with\r\n  the premium payment on July 8, 2002.Â  Campbell submitted an amended application\r\n  on July 11, 2002, for a five-year term policy for $50,000.Â  Auto-Owners\r\n  processed the five-year term policy naming Campbell as the beneficiary on July\r\n  15, 2002, with an effective date of June 28, 2002.Â  The company backdated the\r\n  policy because Campbell had submitted the premium payment with the June 28,\r\n  2002 application.Â  Campbell testified he supplied the information for the June\r\n  28, 2002 application, and the July 11, 2002 application contained the same\r\n  information. \r\nIn\r\n  both applications, Campbell indicated Father had no medical conditions, when\r\n  Father had significant health issues, including cardiovascular disease and\r\n  breathing difficulties, had suffered a stroke, and required assistance to do\r\n  routine activities, such as dressing himself, eating, bathing, using the\r\n  bathroom, and moving around.[2]Â \r\n  Father was also a smoker, and the applications indicated he was not.Â  A nursing\r\n  home admitted Father on July 5, 2002, due to his deteriorating medical\r\n  condition, and Campbell signed the admission documents because Father was\r\n  physically and mentally unable to participate in the admission process.[3]Â \r\n  Brown testified that Auto-Owners issues a policy if all the medical questions\r\n  on the application are answered &quot;no,&quot; and denies the application if\r\n  any of the answers are &quot;yes.&quot;Â Â  \r\nTherefore,\r\n  sufficient evidence exists from which the jury could find the insurance company\r\n  based the June 28, 2002 insurance policy on the July 11, 2002 application, and we\r\n  find the court did not err in denying Campbell's motion for directed verdict.Â  \r\nIV.&nbsp; Incontestable Insurance Statute\r\nCampbell\r\n  argues the court erred in not\r\n  charging the jury on the incontestability insurance statute because it directly\r\n  affects whether his receipt of money was undeserved.[4]Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  trial court's duty is to give a requested instruction that correctly states the\r\n  law applicable to the issues and is supported by the evidence.Â  State v.\r\n    Dickey, 380 S.C. 384, 395, 669 S.E.2d 917, 923 (Ct. App. 2008). Â The court's\r\n  refusal to give a requested jury charge must be both erroneous and prejudicial\r\n  to the defendant to warrant reversal.Â  Id.Â  The failure to give one side's\r\n  requested instructions is not prejudicial if the instructions given to the jury\r\n  afford the proper test for determining the issues.Â  Id.\r\nIn Blackwell\r\n  v. United Insurance Co. of America, our supreme court stated an\r\n  incontestable clause &quot;means only this, that within the limits of the\r\n  coverage the policy shall stand, unaffected by any defense that it was invalid\r\n  from its inception, or thereafter became invalid by reason of a condition\r\n  broken.&quot;Â  231 S.C. 535, 538-39, 99 S.E.2d 414, 416 (1957) (quoting Metropolitan\r\n    Life Ins. Co. v. Conway, 169 N.E. 642, 642 (N.Y. 1930)).Â  In Livingston\r\n      v. Mutual Beneficial Life Insurance Co., our supreme court explained the\r\n  effect of the incontestable clause:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  &quot;incontestable clause&quot; relates to the validity of the contract of\r\n  insurance. Â It does not affect the construction of the terms of the contract. .\r\n  . . The incontestable clause &quot;controls all matters which would have the\r\n  effect of defeating or destroying the contract of life insurance, such as those\r\n  relating to the cause of death or the habits of the insured, although it will\r\n  not control matters which affect the remedy merely.&quot;Â  \r\n\r\n173 S.C. 87, 88, 174 S.E.\r\n  900, 901 (1934) (citation omitted).\r\nAt\r\n  trial, Campbell requested a jury charge on the incontestable statute, but the\r\n  court denied the request, finding the incontestability was between the insured\r\n  and the carrier and the court should not charge a civil statute in a criminal\r\n  matter.Â  Campbell asserts that under the incontestable insurance statute, even\r\n  if some of his answers on the application were false, Auto-Owners must pay\r\n  Campbell the policy proceeds because Father lived two years after he signed the\r\n  application.Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State charged Campbell with making a false statement or misrepresentation in\r\n  violation of section 38-55-540 of the South Carolina Code, which is a criminal\r\n  statute found in the Omnibus Insurance Fraud and Reporting Immunity Act.Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 38-55-510 to 590 (2002 &amp; Supp. 2010).Â  Section 38-55-520\r\n  provides the purpose of the Act &quot;is to confront aggressively the problem\r\n  of insurance fraud in South Carolina[,] . . . to prescribe penalties for\r\n  insurance fraud[, and] . . . to establish a division within the Office of the\r\n  Attorney General to prosecute insurance fraud . . . .&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  38-55-520 (2002).Â  The Act does not provide any time limitations on criminal\r\n  actions for insurance fraud.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  contrast, the incontestability clause is between the insured and the carrier,\r\n  and is a civil statute.Â  The issue in this case is not whether the insurance\r\n  company paid the policy, but is whether Campbell provided false information to\r\n  obtain the policy in the first place.Â  If the court applied the\r\n  incontestability clause to a case for insurance fraud, it would inject civil\r\n  law into a criminal proceeding.Â  It also would allow an insured to make a false\r\n  statement on an insurance application with no consequence if the insured lives\r\n  more than two years after an insurance company issues a policy, which is\r\n  contradictory to the intent of the Omnibus Insurance Fraud and Reporting\r\n  Immunity Act.Â  Therefore, we find the court did not err in denying Campbell's\r\n  request to charge the jury on the incontestable statute.\r\nV.&nbsp; Value\r\n  of Life Insurance Policy\r\nCampbell\r\n  argues the court erred in not\r\n  directing a verdict for Campbell because the policy had no cash value at the\r\n  time Auto-Owners issued it, and the policy's value is measured at the time of\r\n  receipt.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of\r\n  evidence, not its weight, when ruling on a motion for a directed verdict.Â  Brannon,\r\n  388 S.C. at 501, 697 S.E.2d at 595.Â  The defendant is entitled to a directed\r\n  verdict if the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.Â  Id.Â \r\n  &quot;When reviewing a denial of a directed verdict, this court views the\r\n  evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the\r\n  nonmoving party.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nCampbell\r\n  argues the indictments allege the wrongful act was the filling out of the\r\n  application and the receipt of the policy; however, he asserts there is no\r\n  evidence the policy had any value at that time.Â  Campbell maintains the only\r\n  evidence of value is that two years and eight months after the time alleged in\r\n  the indictment, when Father passed away, the insurance company paid the policy\r\n  proceeds.Â  He asserts that neither indictment alleges his receipt of the policy\r\n  money was wrongful.Â  Therefore, Campbell argues the court should have granted\r\n  his motion for directed verdict.\r\nDenise\r\n  Miller, the owner of a viatical and life settlement provider, testified her\r\n  company purchased life insurance policies for a percentage of the death\r\n  benefit, and in 2005, a broker brought her six policies on Father to consider\r\n  purchasing.Â  Miller's company obtained Father's medical records and got an\r\n  independent opinion that Father's life expectancy was only three months.Â  Therefore,\r\n  Miller advised the broker that it would not be in the family's best interest to\r\n  sell the policies, but the broker said Campbell wanted to sell them anyway.Â \r\n  Campbell completed the purchase contract and returned it to Miller with the\r\n  original policies and applications.Â  Miller's company then initiated an\r\n  investigation and discovered significant inconsistencies in Father's medical\r\n  condition and the applications.Â  When Miller contacted Campbell about the\r\n  inconsistencies, he stated they had completed the applications &quot;to the\r\n  best of their abilities.&quot;Â  Campbell also told her it was beyond the\r\n  two-year suicide and contestable periods, so the insurance companies would\r\n  still pay the policy proceeds.Â  Miller told Campbell she was unwilling to\r\n  complete the purchase, and she notified the appropriate authorities of the\r\n  potential fraud.\r\nTherefore,\r\n  sufficient evidence exists from which a jury could find the Auto-Owners policy\r\n  had value from the date the company issued the policy, and we find the court\r\n  did not err in denying Campbell's motion for directed verdict.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the trial\r\n  court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J., SHORT and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  The insurance agent testified Campbell told her\r\n  Father was still working in the landscaping business, and he lived in\r\n  Columbia.Â  Campbell never mentioned Father was ill or living in a nursing home\r\n  in McCormick County.Â  She also testified she had no knowledge anyone other than\r\n  Father signed the applications.\r\n[3]Â  The admission nurse testified that Campbell was very\r\n  knowledgeable about Father's condition and his needs.\r\n[4]Â  In his brief, Campbell cites to section 38-63-200 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code; however, this section does not exist.Â  Thus, we assume\r\n  he meant to cite section 38-63-220(d), which mandates that insurance policies\r\n  must contain &quot;a provision that the policy . . . [is] incontestable as to\r\n  the truth of the application for insurance and to the representations of the\r\n  insured individual after they have been in force during the lifetime of the\r\n  insured for a period of two years from their date of issue.&quot;Â  S.C.

GainesÂ¸ 380 S.C. 23, 31, 667 S.E.2d 728, 732&nbsp;(2008).Â \r\n  Moreover, &quot;[t]he law to be charged to the jury\r\n  is determined by the evidence presented at trial.&quot;&nbsp; Id.Â \r\n  Therefore, &quot;[i]f there is any evidence in the\r\n  record from which it could reasonably be inferred that the defendant acted in\r\n  self-defense, the defendant is entitled to instructions on the defense,\r\n  and the trial judge's refusal to do so is reversible error.&quot;Â  State v.\r\n    Slater, 373 S.C. 66, 70, 644 S.E.2d 50, 52 (2007).Â  A defendant must prove four elements to establish self-defense,\r\n  including that &quot;the defendant must be without fault in bringing on the\r\n  difficulty.&quot;Â Id. at 69, 644 S.E.2d at 52.Â  &quot;Any act of an\r\n  accused that is reasonably calculated to produce the occasion amounts to\r\n  bringing on the difficulty and bars the right to assert self-defense.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Dickey, 380 S.C. 384, 394, 669 S.E.2d 917, 922 (Ct. App. 2008)\r\n  (citation omitted).Â  \r\nHere, Parker's conduct was\r\n  reasonably calculated to produce an altercation between him and a police\r\n  officer.Â  Parker's own testimony corroborated other witnesses' testimony he had\r\n  a gun in his hand when he pursued an undercover officer, who was attempting to\r\n  escape an apartment complex because he believed his undercover status had been\r\n  compromised.Â  Accordingly, Parker brought on the altercation, and the trial\r\n  court properly declined to instruct the jury on self-defense.\r\n2. Parker next argues the trial court erred in denying\r\n  his motion for a mistrial because the State violated his rights pursuant to Maryland\r\n    v. Brady, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) and the Confrontation Clause of the United\r\n  States Constitution.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n&quot;[W]hether\r\n  to grant or deny a mistrial is within the discretion of the trial court and\r\n  will not be reversed on appeal absent an\r\n  abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  State v. Herring, 387 S.C. 201, 216, 692\r\n  S.E.2d 490, 498 (2009) (citation omitted).Â  Moreover, whether to grant a\r\n  mistrial is determined by &quot;'whether the mistrial was dictated by manifest necessity or the ends of public\r\n  justice.'&quot;Â  State v. Stanley, 365 S.C. 24, 34, 615 S.E.2d 455,\r\n  460&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005) (quoting State v. Prince, 279 S.C. 30, 33, 301\r\n  S.E.2d 471, 472 (1983)).\r\nA due process\r\n  claim pursuant to Brady that the prosecution failed to disclose evidence\r\n  favorable to a defendant despite the defendant's request for that evidence\r\n  requires four elements.Â  Gibson v. State, 334 S.C. 515, 524, 514 S.E.2d 320, 324 (1999) (citations omitted).Â  Two\r\n  of those elements are that the evidence &quot;was in possession of or known to\r\n  the prosecution&quot; and &quot;was suppressed by the prosecution.&quot;Â  Id. (citations omitted).Â  Here, Parker could not impeach an adverse witness on the\r\n  witness's two-year-old conviction of a felony gun offense because neither the\r\n  State nor Parker knew of the conviction during Parker's trial.Â  They learned of\r\n  the conviction because, while they awaited the jury's decision for Parker's\r\n  trial, they attended the proceedings in which the witness pleaded and received\r\n  sentencing for a charge of assault with intent to kill.Â  Therefore, the State did\r\n  not violate Parker's right to evidence pursuant to Brady because the\r\n  State did not know of or suppress the witness's conviction. Â \r\n&quot;The right\r\n  to meaningful cross-examination of an adverse witness is included in the\r\n  defendant's Sixth Amendment right [under the United States Constitution] to\r\n  confront his accuser.&quot;Â  State v. Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. 526, 544, 552\r\n  S.E.2d 300, 309 (2001) (citations omitted).\r\n  Â However, &quot;[v]iolations of the Confrontation\r\n  Clause are subject to a harmless error analysis.&quot;Â  State v. Holder,\r\n  382 S.C. 278, 285, 676 S.E.2d 690, 694 (2009) (citation omitted).Â  The\r\n  test is whether &quot;'the evidence is overwhelming\r\n  and the violation so insignificant by comparison that we are persuaded, beyond\r\n  a reasonable doubt, that the violation did not affect the verdict.'&quot;Â  Id. (quoting State v. Vincent, 120 P.3d 120, 124 (2005)).Â  A reviewing court must consider &quot;'the importance of\r\n  the witness's testimony, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or\r\n  absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness\r\n  on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and\r\n  the overall strength of the prosecution's case.'&quot;Â  Id. (quoting Vincent,\r\n  120 P.3d at 124).Â  \r\nHere, even though Parker\r\n  could not impeach the adverse witness on the conviction, most of that witness's\r\n  testimony was corroborated and expounded upon by the testimony of Parker and\r\n  the undercover officer.Â  Moreover, the court allowed extensive\r\n  cross-examination of the witness, and Parker used that cross-examination both\r\n  to corroborate parts of Parker's story and impeach the witness's credibility. Â Therefore,\r\n  any violation of Parker's Confrontation Clause rights was harmless, and the trial\r\n  court acted within its discretion in denying Parker's motion for a mistrial.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and\r\n  LOCKEMY, JJ., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-061","title":"Mountain View Baptist Church v.

Kern-Fuller, of Easley, for\r\n          Appellant.\r\n        Kirby Mitchell, of Greenville, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Mountain\r\n  View Baptist Church (the Church) appeals a circuit court's holding a magistrate's\r\n  writ of ejectment against Bobby Lee Burdine was void. Â We reverse and reinstate\r\n  the writ.[1]\r\nIn 1958, Burdine's parents\r\n  bought an unimproved lot of real property, but they mistakenly built and lived\r\n  in a house on a lot owned by another person.Â  In 1998, the Church bought the lot\r\n  on which the Burdines built their house.Â  Burdine's parents died in 2000, and Burdine\r\n  subsequently moved into the house, living in it until this action.Â  In 2008,\r\n  the Church filed an application to eject Burdine from the lot.Â  Burdine filed\r\n  an answer, asserting he owned the lot and the magistrate lacked subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction because title was in question. The answer also included a\r\n  promise Burdine would accept service of a summons and complaint for an\r\n  ejectment action in circuit court if the Church deposited those documents with\r\n  the magistrate within twenty days of Burdine's answer.Â  \r\nThe Church argues the circuit\r\n  court erred in holding the magistrate lacked subject matter jurisdiction to\r\n  issue the writ.Â  We agree and reverse for the reasons set forth below.Â  \r\n&quot;[I]ssues\r\n  relating to subject matter jurisdiction .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. should\r\n  be taken notice of by this court on our own motion.&quot;Â  Bunkum v. Manor\r\n    Props., 321 S.C. 95, 99-100, 467 S.E.2d 758, 761 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Pursuant\r\n  to article V, section 1 of the South Carolina Constitution, the South Carolina\r\n  legislature has established the subject matter jurisdiction of magistrates in\r\n  ejectment proceedings through a series of statutes.Â  Section 22-3-20 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (2007) provides, &quot;No magistrate shall have cognizance\r\n  of a civil action .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [w]hen the title to real property shall come\r\n  in question, except as provided in Article 11 of this chapter.&quot;Â  \r\nArticle 11 provides, &quot;When the title to real property shall come in\r\n  question in an action brought in a court of a magistrate the defendant may\r\n  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. set forth in his answer any matter showing that such title will\r\n  come in question.&quot;Â  S.C. Code. Ann. Â§ 22-3-1110 (2007).Â  &quot;At the time of answering the defendant shall deliver\r\n  to the magistrate a written undertaking, executed by at least one sufficient\r\n  surety and approved by the magistrate, to the effect&quot; the defendant\r\n  would accept service of a summons and complaint for an ejectment action in\r\n  circuit court if the plaintiff deposited those documents with the magistrate\r\n  within twenty days of the defendant's answer.Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 22-3-1120 (2007).Â  &quot;If such\r\n  an undertaking be not delivered to the magistrate he shall have jurisdiction of\r\n  the cause .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the defendant shall be precluded, in his defense,\r\n  from drawing the title in question.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 22-3-1140 (2007).Â  \r\nHere, the magistrate had\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction to hear the action. Â Burdine did not comply with\r\n  the statutory provisions relating to the magistrate's subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction because Burdine's undertaking was not\r\n  executed by a surety.Â  Therefore, the circuit court erred in holding the\r\n  magistrate's writ of ejectment was void.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHUFF and\r\n  LOCKEMY, JJ., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-062","title":"Roberts v.

Heizer, Jr, of Irmo, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Charlotte\r\n  Roberts appeals the circuit court's grant of summary judgment in her wrongful\r\n  death suit against Elephant, Inc., doing business as Platinum Plus (Platinum\r\n  Plus), for serving alcohol to her son, who was intoxicated at the time of sale\r\n  and died in a related car crash.[1] Â We affirm.[2]\r\nRoberts argues the circuit\r\n  court erred in granting summary judgment to Platinum Plus.Â  Under Rule 56(c) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil\r\n  Procedure, &quot;[s]ummary judgment is appropriate where there is no\r\n  genuine issue of material fact and it is clear the moving party is entitled to\r\n  a judgment as a matter of law.&quot;Â  Hancock v. Mid-South Mgmt. Co., Inc., Â 381 S.C. 326, 329, 673 S.E.2d 801, 802&nbsp;(2009).Â  Here, no material issues of fact exist because Roberts\r\n  presented undisputed evidence Platinum Plus over-served her son, who was\r\n  intoxicated and died in a car crash while driving from the club. Â Therefore, the only remaining issue is\r\n  whether Platinum Plus was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  We hold it\r\n  was.Â  \r\nRoberts contends she is not\r\n  precluded from bringing a first-party negligence per se action against Platinum\r\n  Plus under Tobias v. Sports Club, Inc., 332 S.C. 90, 504 S.E.2d 318\r\n  (1998).Â  According to Roberts, Platinum Plus psychologically manipulated her\r\n  son to purchase alcohol, and Tobias does not\r\n  apply to situations where a patron is unable to resist an establishment's\r\n  encouragement to buy alcohol. Â We disagree.Â  &quot;Negligence\r\n  per se is established by showing a statute created a duty to the plaintiff and\r\n  the defendant breached that duty by violating the statute.&quot;Â  Seals by\r\n    Causey v. Winburn, 314 S.C. 416, 418, 445 S.E.2d 94, 96 (1994) (emphasis omitted).Â \r\n  South Carolina's alcohol control statutes provide, &quot;A[n]\r\n  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. establishment licensed to sell alcoholic liquors or liquor by\r\n  the drink pursuant to this article may not sell these beverages to persons in\r\n  an intoxicated condition .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 61-6-2220 (2009).Â  In Tobias, the South Carolina\r\n  Supreme Court held, &quot;South Carolina does not recognize a 'first party'\r\n  cause of action against the tavern owner by an intoxicated adult predicated on\r\n  an alleged violation&quot; of its alcohol control statutes.Â  332 S.C. at 91,\r\n  504 S.E.2d at 319.Â  The supreme court specifically rejected this court's\r\n  reasoning and conclusion that a purpose of the alcohol control statutes\r\n  &quot;was to protect the intoxicated person from their own incompetence and\r\n  helplessness&quot; and, therefore, an &quot;intoxicated patron .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\r\n  was entitled to bring a negligence suit for a statutory violation.&quot;Â  Id. at 92, 504 S.E.2d at 319.Â  Accordingly, Tobias precludes Roberts from bringing her first-party negligence per\r\n  se action against Platinum Plus because Roberts's alleged helplessness did not\r\n  remove this case from Tobias's reasoning.Â  \r\nRoberts also\r\n  argues she has a common law cause of action against Platinum Plus for serving alcohol to her son in a reckless, grossly\r\n  negligent, willful, and wanton manner.Â  However, she conceded to\r\n  the circuit court that the common law precluded causes of action against\r\n  taverns for serving alcohol to intoxicated patrons, and she cannot now assert that\r\n  theory on appeal.Â  See Ex parte\r\n    McMillan, 319 S.C. 331, 335, 461 S.E.2d\r\n  43, 45 (1995) (holding an issue conceded in\r\n  circuit court cannot be argued on appeal).Â  Moreover, Roberts's remaining arguments are not\r\n  properly before this court. Â See S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Transp. v. First Carolina Corp. of S.C., 372 S.C. 295, 301, 641 S.E.2d 903, 907 (2007) (&quot;'[A]n issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal,\r\n  but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved\r\n  for appellate review.'&quot;) (citation omitted).Â  Accordingly, Roberts was not entitled to bring an action against\r\n  Platinum Plus, and Platinum Plus was entitled to summary judgment.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and\r\n  LOCKEMY, JJ., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Roberts brings this suit pursuant to South Carolina's wrongful death statute.Â  S.C.

Smith, of Charleston, for\r\n          Appellant.\r\n        Jeffrey S. Tibbals, of Charleston, and William\r\n          B. Harvey, III, of Beaufort, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â MPI\r\n  South Carolina-1, LLC (MPI) appeals from an order granting Levy Center, LLC,\r\n  and Boyd Capital, LLC's (collectively, Respondents) motion for summary\r\n  judgment, arguing the master-in-equity erred in (1) ruling that unforeseen\r\n  changes in zoning regulations did not make performance of the contracts\r\n  impossible; (2) concluding the change in property regulations did not excuse\r\n  its obligations of performance under the doctrine of frustration of purpose;\r\n  and (3) granting summary judgment because genuine issues of material fact exist\r\n  concerning the degree of Respondents' involvement with the planned\r\n  development.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nMPI is a South\r\n  Carolina land development firm that contracted with Levy Center to purchase a\r\n  piece of land (Levy Tract).[2]Â \r\n  Levy Center (Levy) owned the property, but Boyd Capital (Boyd) had a purchase\r\n  contract, which it assigned to MPI on March 17, 2006.[3]Â  Boyd completed some preliminary\r\n  development work on the Levy Tract before it assigned its contract with Levy to\r\n  MPI, including due diligence and design of the development.Â  While MPI was\r\n  continuing the due diligence and design work, Jasper County enacted a temporary\r\n  building moratorium on &quot;all land development as well as on commercial\r\n  construction that was greater than 10,000 [square feet] or produced heavy amounts\r\n  of traffic.&quot;Â  Jasper County intended for the moratorium to last from July\r\n  2006 to November 13, 2007; however, on November 13, 2007, the County amended\r\n  the zoning in the area where the Levy Tract was located.Â  The new zoning\r\n  requirements mandated a certain lot size that, according to MPI, had the\r\n  practical effect of making its intended development impossible.\r\nMPI filed a\r\n  declaratory judgment action on May 11, 2007, seeking rescission of the contract\r\n  and a full refund of the payments it made into escrow because the contract had\r\n  failed its essential purpose and was impossible to perform.[4]Â  In their Answers, Levy and Boyd\r\n  alleged MPI was in breach of the contract for failing to make payments on the\r\n  property before the closing date in November 2006.Â  Boyd also alleged the\r\n  assignment agreement provided all amounts paid by MPI to Boyd for the\r\n  assignment were non-refundable regardless of whether MPI closed on the\r\n  property.Â  Levy and Boyd both filed motions for summary judgment, which the\r\n  master granted on February 19, 2009, after a hearing on the matter.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing\r\n  the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same\r\n  standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP, which provides\r\n  summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material\r\n  fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Fleming\r\n    v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  On appeal from an\r\n  order granting summary judgment, the appellate court reviews all ambiguities,\r\n  conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most\r\n  favorable to the non-moving party below.Â  Willis v. Wu, 362 S.C. 146,\r\n  151, 607 S.E.2d 63, 65 (2004).Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Impossibility of\r\n  Performance\r\nMPI argues the master erred\r\n  in ruling that unforeseen changes in zoning regulations did not make\r\n  performance of the contracts impossible.Â  MPI also argues the\r\n  master erred in granting summary judgment because there was substantial\r\n  evidence that the parties were working together toward the same goal, and it\r\n  was immaterial that the parties did not include the purpose in the contract.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nMPI admits the\r\n  documents did not contain an express provision that specifically stated the\r\n  purpose of the contract was to develop the Levy Tract in a specific manner;\r\n  however, it asserts the doctrine of impossibility of performance does not rest\r\n  exclusively on the language of the contract.Â  MPI maintains the doctrine has\r\n  been &quot;extended to include situations in which performance as anticipated\r\n  is not merely physically impossible, but so impracticable as to significantly\r\n  alter the understanding of the parties as to the nature of the underlying\r\n  contract.&quot;Â  It further states the occurrence must be unexpected, but it\r\n  does not have to be unforeseeable.Â  MPI claims the &quot;imposition of a\r\n  building moratorium, and the significant changes in zoning, were unforeseeable\r\n  events, the non-occurrence of which were implicit conditions of the\r\n  contract.&quot; \r\nIn Hawkins v.\r\n  Greenwood Development Corp., 328 S.C. 585, 593, 493 S.E.2d 875, 879 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1997), this court held a party to a contract must perform its obligations\r\n  under the contract unless its performance is rendered impossible by an act of\r\n  God, the law, or by a third party, and impossibility must be real and not a\r\n  mere inconvenience.Â  &quot;A party to a contract cannot be excused from\r\n  performance on the theory of impossibility of performance unless it is made to\r\n  appear that the thing to be done cannot by any means be accomplished, for if it\r\n  is only improbable or out of the power of the obligor, it is not deemed in law\r\n  impossible.&quot;Â  Id. (quoting 17A Am. Jur. 2d Contracts Â§ 673,\r\n  at 681 (1991)).Â  \r\nAlso, in Coker\r\n  International, Inc. v. Burlington Industries, Inc., 747 F. Supp. 1168, 1170\r\n  (D.S.C. 1990), aff'd, 935 F.2d 267 (4th Cir. 1991), the district court\r\n  held that &quot;[s]ubjective impossibility of performing does not relieve a\r\n  party from the contract unless the contract so states.&quot;Â  Further, in Opera\r\n    Co. of Boston v. Wolf Trap Foundation for Performing Arts, 817 F.2d 1094,\r\n  1102 (4th Cir. 1987), the court held a party seeking to rely on the defense of\r\n  impossibility of performance must establish &quot;(1) the unexpected occurrence\r\n  of an intervening act, (2) such occurrence was of such a character that its\r\n  non-occurrence was a basic assumption of the agreement of the parties, and (3)\r\n  that occurrence made performance impracticable.&quot;\r\nPursuant to its\r\n  assignment from Boyd, MPI's duties were to pay the earnest money and purchase\r\n  price, accept the contract of sale, and accept title to the property at\r\n  closing.Â  Therefore, MPI cannot argue any action taken by Jasper County\r\n  affected MPI's ability to perform its duties or its ability to close on the\r\n  property.Â  In addition, the temporary building moratorium did not create an\r\n  impossibility of performance of the contract because MPI continued to go\r\n  forward with the contract even after learning of the moratorium, and neither\r\n  Boyd nor MPI submitted any development plans to Jasper County for consideration\r\n  or approval.Â  Further, the assignment required that Boyd convey to MPI all its\r\n  rights, title, and interest in and to the contract of sale, not the property,\r\n  in exchange for payments made by MPI.Â  Boyd fulfilled its obligations pursuant\r\n  to the agreement, and MPI admitted that Boyd did not breach any term of its\r\n  agreement with MPI.Â  Tom Small, vice president of MPI, also admitted MPI did\r\n  not provide any written notice of termination of the contract for any\r\n  justifiable reason within the contract.\r\nSmall\r\n  acknowledged during his deposition that the contract did not contain any\r\n  language or any other evidence that Levy intended for a particular use or density\r\n  for the property, and the contract did not condition performance under the\r\n  contract upon successful development, zoning, or county approval.Â  Moreover,\r\n  prior to and in conjunction with Boyd's assignment of the contract to MPI, Boyd\r\n  and Levy amended the contract twice, and MPI and Levy amended the contract once\r\n  more after the assignment.Â  These amendments to the contract did not contain\r\n  any contingencies or conditions that would excuse MPI's performance under the\r\n  contract in the event the County altered the zoning of the property in any\r\n  manner.\r\nMPI had not completed a\r\n  conceptual plan of development for the property at the time Jasper County\r\n  issued its moratorium ordinance.Â  Prior to assigning the contract to MPI, Boyd performed due\r\n  diligence and created a conceptual master plan, which it provided to MPI;\r\n  however, there was no evidence that MPI intended to adopt Boyd's master plan\r\n  because MPI separately initiated its own development plans, hired its own land\r\n  planner and market analysis firm, and was preparing a new land plat.Â  In fact,\r\n  James Wolfe, principal member of Boyd, testified Small wanted to increase the\r\n  density by decreasing the size of the lots from Boyd's conceptual plan.\r\nAdditionally, MPI\r\n  admits that after the County lifted the moratorium, it could have completed the\r\n  purchase of the property and developed it for less of a profit.Â  MPI also did\r\n  not submit even a conceptual plan for review to Jasper County; therefore, MPI\r\n  does not know with certainty that the County would have denied its development\r\n  plans.Â  Further, had MPI submitted even an incomplete conceptual master plan\r\n  prior to the cut-off date, it could have avoided the imposition of the building\r\n  moratorium.[5]Â \r\n  Tedd Moyd, who served as Jasper County's Planning and Zoning Coordinator at the\r\n  time the County enacted the ordinance, testified the ordinance exempted parties\r\n  from the moratorium if they filed application for conceptual approval before\r\n  July 13, 2006, even if the application was incomplete.\r\nTherefore, we\r\n  find the master properly granted Respondents' motions for summary judgment\r\n  because, viewed in the light most favorable to MPI, the evidence showed the\r\n  zoning changes did not make performance of the contract impossible, and the\r\n  contract did not condition performance under the contract upon successful\r\n  development, zoning, or county approval. Â In addition, the evidence did not\r\n  show the parties intended that a particular use or density for the property was\r\n  a fundamental premise of the contract.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Doctrine of Frustration of Purpose\r\nMPI argues the master erred\r\n  in concluding the change in property regulations did not excuse its obligations\r\n  of performance under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.Â  We disagree.\r\nSpecifically, MPI asserts the\r\n  master erred in relying on Felt v. McCarthy, 922 P.2d 90 (Wash. 1996), because\r\n  the Felt court did not rely on the foreseeability of the zoning changes,\r\n  but on the purchaser's own acts.Â  MPI contends the parties conditioned the purchase\r\n  agreement in this case entirely and exclusively on the shared intent that the\r\n  property was to be developed as a planned unit development and that development\r\n  was rendered impossible through the actions of the governmental agency.\r\nIn Felt, the defendants\r\n  claimed frustration of purpose excused them from making further payments on their\r\n  note because newly-enacted wetlands regulations prevented them from developing\r\n  the land as a business park.Â  Id. at 91.Â  The defendants owned some land\r\n  and sought to purchase an additional nine acres.Â  Id.Â  They requested to\r\n  have 123 acres, including the nine they wanted to purchase, rezoned as a\r\n  business park, but the county denied their request because they did not own all\r\n  the property they wanted rezoned.Â  Id.Â  Even though they were unable to get\r\n  the property rezoned, the defendants purchased the nine acres, and the sales\r\n  contract did not place any conditions on the sale.Â  Id.Â  About a month\r\n  later, the Army Corp of Engineers released a manual delineating protected\r\n  wetlands, and the county ultimately adopted regulations that rendered the land\r\n  useful only as a single home site or as open space.Â  Id. at 91-92.Â  The\r\n  defendants defaulted on their note, and as an affirmative defense, they argued\r\n  the court should excuse all unpaid portions of the note due to frustration of\r\n  purpose.Â  Id. at 92.Â  The court held the frustration of purpose doctrine\r\n  was unavailable because for the doctrine to apply, the purpose that was\r\n  frustrated must have been a principal purpose of that party in making the\r\n  contract, the frustration must be substantial, and the non-occurrence of the\r\n  frustrating event must have been a basic assumption on which the parties made\r\n  the contract.Â  Id. at 93.Â  The court stated that had the defendants\r\n  wanted to condition the real estate deal upon the successful development of a\r\n  business park, they clearly had the power to include that condition in the\r\n  contract; however, they failed to assign any risk of the business park failure\r\n  to the seller.Â  Id.Â  Therefore, the court found it should not correct the\r\n  defendants' mistake by using the frustration doctrine to read such conditions implicitly\r\n  into the sales contract.Â  Id.\r\nThe Felt court further\r\n  held a reduction in market value was insufficient in and of itself to support a\r\n  finding of frustration.Â  Id. at 94 (citing Restatement (Second) of\r\n  Contracts Â§ 265 cmt. a (1979) (&quot;It is not enough that the transaction has\r\n  become less profitable for the affected party or even that he will sustain a\r\n  loss.&quot;)).Â  Likewise, in Duke\r\n    Power Co. v. South Carolina Public Service Commission, 284 S.C. 81, 89, 326\r\n  S.E.2d 395, 400 (1985), our supreme court held that &quot;a party to a contract\r\n  should not be given relief from the requirements of the contract simply because\r\n  it proved to be less favorable than an alternative provision would have been.&quot;Â  \r\nSimilarly, in Coker\r\n  International, the South Carolina District Court found the actions of the\r\n  government of Peru may have frustrated Coker's intended resale of the equipment\r\n  to a customer in Peru; however, that was not the purpose of its contract with\r\n  Burlington, which was the conveyance of the looms from Burlington to Coker.Â \r\n  747 F.Supp. at 1171.Â  The court also noted the parties did not insert a condition\r\n  into the agreement that would have conditioned Coker's obligation to pay on the\r\n  successful resale of the equipment.Â  Id.\r\nAs stated in Felt and Coker\r\n  International, MPI could have negotiated a provision in the contract to\r\n  provide protection against an unfavorable zoning change.Â Â  Small admitted the contract did not\r\n  contain any language or any other evidence that the contract conditioned\r\n  performance under the contract upon successful development, zoning, or county\r\n  approval.Â  Anthony Pasquinelli, one of the owners of MPI, testified that MPI\r\n  knew zoning changes could occur and it could have protected itself by including\r\n  the conditions in the contract, but did not do so.Â  Additionally, although Boyd\r\n  and Levy amended the contract twice, and MPI and Levy amended the contract once\r\n  more after the assignment, none of the amendments contained any contingency or\r\n  condition that would excuse MPI's performance under the contract in the event\r\n  of a zoning change.\r\nFurther, MPI's claim only raises a property\r\n  valuation issue, and MPI admits it could have purchased the property and\r\n  developed it for less of a profit.Â  Moreover, MPI never submitted even a\r\n  conceptual plan for review to Jasper County; thus, MPI does not know with\r\n  certainty that Jasper County would have denied their development plans.Â  If MPI\r\n  had filed even an incomplete application for conceptual approval with the\r\n  County prior to July 13, 2006, it could have avoided the imposition of the\r\n  building moratorium.Â  Small testified that neither MPI nor Boyd formally\r\n  submitted any development plans to Jasper County for approval.\r\nEven if MPI could prove the\r\n  change in property regulations excused its obligations of performance under the\r\n  doctrine of frustration of purpose, the clear terms of the assignment state the\r\n  payments made by MPI were non-refundable, regardless of whether MPI closed on\r\n  the purchase of the property.Â  In\r\n  his deposition, Small testified he knew the amounts paid under the contract\r\n  were non-refundable, regardless of whether MPI purchased the property.Â  Therefore,\r\n  the clear terms of the contract are evidence the parties did not share an\r\n  intent that MPI's inability to develop the property in a specific manner would\r\n  permit the return of the amounts paid by MPI.Â  Further, MPI cites Restatement\r\n  (Second) of Contracts Â§ 265 for authority regarding frustration of purpose;\r\n  however, that section provides that when a purpose is frustrated by\r\n  unanticipated events, only its remaining duties to render performance are\r\n  discharged, not those duties already performed.Â  \r\nIn Coker International,\r\n  the South Carolina District Court held that even if the frustration of purpose\r\n  doctrine applied, it would only discharge Coker's remaining duties and would\r\n  not affect the completed payment of the non-refundable down payment.Â  747\r\n  F.Supp. at 1171.Â  The court further noted the express contractual provision\r\n  provided the down payment would be non-refundable, which negated Coker's\r\n  argument that the successful resale of the equipment was an implicit condition\r\n  of its obligation to make the payment.Â  Id.Â  Thus, even if MPI could demonstrate facts\r\n  sufficient to meet the requirements of the\r\n  doctrine of frustration of purpose, the doctrine would only excuse MPI of its\r\n  remaining duties.Â  The master\r\n  did not compel MPI to perform any of its remaining duties under the contract,\r\n  and Boyd did not seek specific performance or attempt to make MPI close on the\r\n  purchase of the property.\r\nTherefore, we\r\n  find the master properly granted Respondents' motions for summary judgment\r\n  because, viewed in the light most favorable to MPI, the evidence showed MPI did not meet the requirements for the doctrine of\r\n  frustration of purpose, and was not excused from its obligations of\r\n  performance.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the master's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J.,\r\n  SHORT and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  MPI is a subsidiary of a national corporation\r\n  engaged in the business of building residential and mixed-use developments.\r\n[3] Â MPI initially\r\n  named the Savannah Bank and the McNair Law Firm as defendants in the action,\r\n  but the court dismissed both parties from the case when they deposited the\r\n  funds held by them in escrow with the Jasper County Clerk of Court.\r\n[4]Â  MPI filed the action in the court of common pleas, and\r\n  by consent order, the parties referred the case to the master-in-equity.\r\n[5]Â  Ordinance R06-27 exempted properties for which parties\r\n  had submitted development plans for approval by July 13, 2006.Â  Jasper County,\r\n  S.C., Ordinance R06-27 (September 18, 2006).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-066","title":"Crawford v.

Kennedy, Jr., both of Batesburg-Leesville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; Mary Lou Moseley appeals the trial court's granting of Jim Oswald's motion to conform vehicle titles pursuant to Rule 60(b),\r\nSCRCP.&nbsp; We reverse.[1]\r\nIn 1998, Moseley brought suit against Oswald seeking in part the return of seven automobiles and damages for conversion.&nbsp; In 2008, a jury found Oswald\r\ndid not have to return the vehicles and therefore did not reach the second cause of action for conversion.&nbsp; Thus, at trial, it was not expressly determined\r\nwho owned the vehicles.&nbsp; &nbsp;The jury verdict form stated only that Oswald did not have to return the vehicles to Moseley.&nbsp; In March 2009, Oswald\r\nmoved &quot;pursuant to Rule 60, SCRCP and/or such other law as may be applicable&quot; for an order conforming title in the vehicles.&nbsp; After a hearing,\r\nthe trial court granted the motion and issued another order, referring repeatedly to Rule 60, SCRCP, requiring the South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles\r\nto issue titles to the vehicles in Oswaldâ€™s name.&nbsp;\r\nOswald contends the trial court did not err by issuing the order because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in providing relief through Rule\r\n60(b).&nbsp; Moreover, Oswald argues the trial court did not err by issuing the order because the trial court has the inherent power to issue an order to give\r\npractical effect to the jury verdict.&nbsp; Oswald also argues Moseley lacks standing to bring an appeal because she has no property interest or rights which\r\nwere adversely affected by the post-trial order.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  Rule 60(b), SCRCP, provides:\r\n  \r\n    On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the\r\n    following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been\r\n    discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is\r\n    void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it\r\n    is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.\r\n  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, &quot;[w]hether to grant or deny a motion under Rule 60(b) lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. &nbsp;Therefore, our standard of\r\nreview is limited to determining whether there was an abuse of discretion. . . . [which] arises when the order was controlled by an error of law . . .\r\n.&quot;&nbsp; Se. Hous. Found. v. Smith, 380 S.C. 621, 636, 670 S.E.2d 680, 688&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2008).&nbsp; Rule 60(b) is not the proper procedural\r\nvehicle to address Oswald's unique situation.&nbsp; Rule 60(b) does not provide a means by which a trial court can grant a prevailing defendant a remedy he did\r\nnot seek at trial.&nbsp; See e.g. Cnty. of Durham v. Daye, 673 S.E.2d 683, 688 (N.C. App. 2009) (finding a trial court has no authority to\r\nenter an order granting a Rule 60 motion if that order does not set aside the judgment or relieve the moving party of it); Affordable Country Homes, LLC v.\r\nSmith, 194 P.3d 511, 514 (Colo. App. 2008) (stating Rule 60(b) is available only to set aside a prior order and cannot be used to impose additional\r\naffirmative relief).\r\nAlthough Oswald prevailed at trial, there is no indication he sought any affirmative relief or determination that he was the owner of the vehicles.&nbsp; The\r\njury determined Oswald did not have to return the vehicles to Moseley because Moseley was unable to prove to a jury she owned the vehicles. Thus, the verdict\r\nonly determined the issue of ownership as between Moseley and Oswald.&nbsp; Because Rule 60(b), SCRCP, is not the proper procedural vehicle for Oswald to obtain\r\nrelief, Oswald must seek to have the vehicle titles conformed by means of a separate action.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHUFF, SHORT, and PIEPER, JJ., concur.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-068","title":"In the Matter of Don R.

Â We\r\n  affirm.[1]\r\nAn\r\n  appellate court reviews the denial of a directed verdict by viewing the\r\n  evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the\r\n  State.Â  State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006).Â \r\n  &quot;If there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence\r\n  reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, [an appellate court] must\r\n  find the case was properly submitted to the jury.&quot;Â  Id. at 292-93,\r\n  625 S.E.2d at 648.Â  The circuit court may not consider the weight of the\r\n  evidence.Â  Id. at 292, 625 S.E.2d at 648.Â  However, when the evidence\r\n  &quot;merely raises a suspicion&quot; of guilt, a directed verdict is proper.Â  State\r\n    v. Lollis, 343 S.C. 580, 584, 541 S.E.2d 254, 256 (2001).Â  A mere suspicion\r\n  is a belief that is inspired by &quot;facts or circumstances which do not\r\n  amount to proof.&quot; Â Id.\r\nTrafficking\r\n  in cocaine occurs when a person is &quot;knowingly in actual or constructive\r\n  possession&quot; of &quot;ten grams or more of cocaine or any mixtures\r\n  containing cocaine.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e), (e)(2) (2002).Â  Constructive\r\n  possession can be established by circumstantial evidence.Â  State v. Brown,\r\n  267 S.C. 311, 315, 227 S.E.2d 674, 676 (1976).Â  &quot;'[T]he State must show a\r\n  defendant had dominion or control, or the right to exercise dominion or\r\n  control.'&quot;Â  State v.

Hudson, 277 S.C. 200, 202, 284 S.E.2d\r\n  773, 774-75 (1981)).\r\nHere, substantial circumstantial evidence existed showing Boyd\r\n  knowingly possessed the requisite amount of cocaine. Â Specifically, the arresting officer testified he\r\n  discovered a medicine bottle containing drugs in the grass next to the driver's\r\n  side door.Â  Labs tests determined the\r\n  contents of the medicine bottle to be 10.90 grams of cocaine and 4.37 grams of\r\n  crack cocaine.Â  The only other passenger in the vehicle testified the medicine\r\n  bottle was in the vehicle prior to the stop.Â  She also said she did not throw\r\n  it from the vehicle.Â  This evidence, in\r\n  addition to Boyd's flight, his admission of recent drug use, and the drug\r\n  paraphernalia found on the driver's side of the vehicle, permits the jury to\r\n  reasonably infer guilt.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS, GEATHERS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-071","title":"Walter Mortgage Company v.

Smith, of N. Charleston, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tSteven A. McKelvey, Christopher C. Genovese and Thomas William McGee, III, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this\r\n  action for breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty of\r\n  merchantability, fraudulent misrepresentation, and conversion, Jenner Trucking\r\n  and Construction (Jenner Trucking) appeals the grant of summary judgment to\r\n  Defendant Pioneer Machinery (Pioneer).Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nIn 2003, Jenner Trucking purchased an HC-4400-B Waste\r\n  Recycler (&quot;grinder&quot;) manufactured by Peterson Pacific Corp. (Peterson)\r\n  from Pioneer for use in its land clearing business.Â  Timothy Jenner, the\r\n  president and sole shareholder of Jenner Trucking, finalized the purchase after\r\n  a trial period during which Jenner Trucking's head mechanic noticed numerous\r\n  problems with the machine that indicated it had &quot;been sitting up for a\r\n  while.&quot; Â Within six months of the date of purchase, the clutch on the\r\n  grinder malfunctioned.Â  Pioneer replaced the clutch at no cost to Jenner\r\n  Trucking, but it malfunctioned again less than a month later.Â  This time,\r\n  however, although Pioneer repaired the grinder, it refused to return it to\r\n  Jenner until he paid the $12,000 repair bill, which Jenner did about a year\r\n  later.Â  \r\nJenner Trucking\r\n  then filed the present lawsuit against Pioneer and Peterson, asserting claims\r\n  for breach of express and implied warranties, fraudulent misrepresentation, and\r\n  conversion.Â  Both defendants moved for summary judgment after filing responsive\r\n  pleadings, and the trial judge conducted separate hearings on the motions.Â  The\r\n  trial judge then granted summary judgment to Pioneer, holding (1) Pioneer did\r\n  not provide an express warranty to Jenner Trucking, (2) Jenner Trucking's claim\r\n  for breach of implied warranty of merchantability failed as a matter of law\r\n  because of the disclaimer on the sales contract, (3) Jenner Trucking's\r\n  fraudulent misrepresentation failed as a matter of law because any reliance on\r\n  any alleged misrepresentation would be unreasonable, and (4) Pioneer did not\r\n  convert the grinder for its own use.Â  In a separate order, the trial judge\r\n  granted only partial summary judgment to Peterson, holding (1) there were\r\n  questions of fact as to whether Peterson complied with the terms of its express\r\n  limited warranty, (2) Peterson had effectively disclaimed the implied warranty\r\n  of merchantability, (3) there was no evidence that Peterson made any false\r\n  statements to induce Jenner to purchase the grinder and Jenner's reliance on\r\n  any such false representations would have been unreasonable, and (4) Jenner's\r\n  claim for lost profits was speculative and was disclaimed under the express\r\n  limited warranty.\r\nJenner Trucking unsuccessfully\r\n  moved for reconsideration of both orders and then filed a notice of appeal.Â  While\r\n  the appeal was pending in this court, Jenner Trucking settled its claim against\r\n  Peterson.\r\n1.&nbsp; Jenner Trucking argues the trial\r\n  judge erred in finding the disclaimer on the sales contract effectively\r\n  disclaimed any possible warranties, express or implied, on the grinder.Â  In\r\n  support of his argument that the disclaimer was invalid, Jenner Trucking points\r\n  out that (1) the front page of the document contained an express warranty,\r\n  which, under section 36-2-316(1) of the South Carolina Code (2003), Pioneer\r\n  could not disclaim in the same agreement[2] and (2) although the disclaimer complied with the technical requirements of the\r\n  South Carolina Uniform Commercial Code, it was not truly\r\n  &quot;conspicuous&quot; as that term is used in section 36-2-316(2).Â  We\r\n  disagree with these arguments.\r\nCounsel for Jenner Trucking argued to the trial judge\r\n  that Jenner believed the express warranty included in the sales agreement came\r\n  from Pioneer rather than Peterson; however, during his deposition, Jenner\r\n  responded affirmatively to a question regarding whether he &quot;received the\r\n  Peterson Pacific manufacturer warranty of nine months, a thousand hours.&quot;Â \r\n  Â Furthermore, there is nothing in the record suggesting Pioneer gave Jenner\r\n  Trucking an express warranty on the grinder.Â  We therefore hold the trial judge\r\n  was correct in determining that the only express warranty at issue here was\r\n  issued by Peterson, the manufacturer of the grinder.Â  Pioneer never attempted\r\n  to disclaim any warranty issued by Peterson; therefore, section 36-2-316(1),\r\n  which prohibits such disclaimers, is not applicable here.\r\n2.&nbsp; Jenner Trucking further contends\r\n  there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the disclaimer was\r\n  conspicuous.Â  We disagree.Â  The disclaimer included the word\r\n  &quot;merchantability&quot; and was set off in block letters rather than lower\r\n  case letters; therefore, it satisfied the relevant statutory requirements to be\r\n  effective.Â  Jenner Trucking, though acknowledging this contrast in type, argues\r\n  the paragraph following the disclaimer was also in block letters and contends\r\n  this creates a genuine issue of material fact regarding conspicuousness.Â  In\r\n  contrast to the following paragraph, however, the disclaimer was also italicized.Â \r\n  We therefore affirm the trial judge's determination that the disclaimer of the\r\n  warranty of merchantability satisfied the relevant statutory requirements.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-316(2) (2003) (requiring exclusions or modifications of\r\n  the implied warranty of merchantability to mention merchantability and to be in\r\n  writing and conspicuous); id. Â§ 36-1-201(10) (stating &quot;[l]anguage in\r\n  the body of a form is 'conspicuous' if it is in larger or other contrasting\r\n    type or color&quot; and specifying that &quot;[w]hether a term or clause is\r\n  'conspicuous' or not is for decision by the court&quot;) (emphasis added).\r\n3.&nbsp; Jenner Trucking complains that\r\n  although the trial judge properly denied Peterson's summary judgment motion\r\n  with respect to the express warranty it provided, the trial judge incorrectly\r\n  granted summary judgment to Peterson based on the disclaimer language in the\r\n  sales contract, to which Peterson was not a party.Â  Because Peterson has been\r\n  dismissed with prejudice from this appeal, it is unnecessary to address this\r\n  issue.\r\n4.&nbsp; Jenner Trucking next\r\n  contends significant material factual disputes remain regarding its claims for\r\n  fraudulent misrepresentation, namely, that contrary to Jenner's intention to\r\n  purchase a &quot;like new&quot; machine that was in good shape, had no previous\r\n  problems, and would not require extensive maintenance in the near future, the\r\n  grinder Pioneer sold him was about seven years old and had been sitting on\r\n  Pioneer's lot for much of that time without maintenance.Â  Jenner Trucking\r\n  further challenges the trial judge's reasoning that because Jenner had actual\r\n  knowledge that the grinder had been previously operated with approximately\r\n  forty to sixty hours of prior use, he could not have justifiably relied on the\r\n  description in the contract that it was &quot;new,&quot; arguing the questions\r\n  regarding reasonable reliance generally involve factual determinations.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nJenner Trucking is correct that issues of\r\n  reliance are generally determined by the finder of fact; however, &quot;if the\r\n  undisputed evidence clearly shows the party asserting reliance has knowledge of\r\n  the truth of the matter, there is no genuine issue of material fact.&quot; Quail\r\n    Hill, LLC v. County of Richland, 387 S.C. 223, 240, 692 S.E.2d 499, 508\r\n  (2010) (citing Gruber v. Santee Frozen Foods, Inc., 309 S.C. 13, 20, 419\r\n  S.E.2d 795, 800 (Ct. App. 1992)).Â  See also Whitman v. Seaboard Air\r\n    Line Ry., 107 S.C. 200, 204, 92 S.E. 861, 863 (1917) (&quot;[E]ven if there\r\n  had been fraud, its effect was destroyed by the abundant opportunity to learn\r\n  the truth.&quot;).Â  Here, it was undisputed that (1) Jenner held himself out as\r\n  an expert in grinders and had purchased several machines in the past, (2)\r\n  Jenner could have easily determined the age and condition of the grinder before\r\n  buying it by using the serial number or requesting the maintenance records from\r\n  Pioneer, and (3) Jenner's own mechanic warned him of problems he had observed\r\n  during the demo period.Â  The record supports the trial judge's determination\r\n  that Jenner could not have reasonably relied on any alleged misrepresentations\r\n  made by Pioneer's employees.\r\n5.&nbsp; Jenner Trucking argues\r\n  the trial judge erred in requiring definitive proof of lost profits and cites\r\n  authority that the law does not require absolute certainty before lost profits\r\n  can be recovered.Â  See Collins Holding Corp. v. Landrum, 360 S.C.\r\n  346, 350, 601 S.E.2d 332, 333-34 (2004).Â  This ruling appears only in the order\r\n  granting partial summary judgment to Peterson.Â  Because Peterson has been\r\n  dismissed from this appeal, we do not believe it is necessary to address this\r\n  issue, particularly in view of our proposed disposition to affirm on the\r\n  remaining issues.\r\n6.&nbsp; Jenner Trucking next\r\n  argues the trial judge erred in dismissing its conversion claim on the ground\r\n  that it was &quot;simply a restatement of its breach of warranty claims under a\r\n  different name.&quot;Â  It further contends the second repair that Pioneer made\r\n  to the clutch system was unauthorized and therefore amounted to conversion.Â  We\r\n  find no reversible error.\r\nIn its complaint, Jenner Trucking made no\r\n  reference to unauthorized repairs to the grinder as the basis for its conversion\r\n  claim.Â  During discovery, Jenner Trucking, in response to an interrogatory from\r\n  Pioneer requesting all facts and circumstances to support its contention that\r\n  Pioneer converted the grinder to its own use in derogation of Jenner Trucking's\r\n  property rights, stated only that &quot;[a]fter repairing the clutch, Pioneer\r\n  refused to cover the repairs under the warranty.Â  The Defendant further refused\r\n  to place the amount due onto the Plaintiff[']s parts account.&quot;Â  Furthermore,\r\n  contrary to Jenner Trucking's argument on appeal that the basis for its\r\n  conversion claim was &quot;an assertion for unauthorized repairs,&quot; during\r\n  the summary judgment hearing, counsel for Jenner Trucking did not specifically\r\n  assert that Jenner instructed Pioneer not to perform any repairs that were not\r\n  covered by warranty.Â  Under these circumstances, we agree with the trial judge\r\n  that Jenner Trucking's conversion claim was merely a restatement of its claims\r\n  for breach of warranty.Â  See Langehans v. Smith, 347 S.C. 348,\r\n  353, 554 S.E.2d 681, 684 (Ct. App. 2001) (holding an issue was not preserved\r\n  for appeal because the appellants &quot;did not raise this specific argument to\r\n  the trial court&quot;).Â  \r\n7.&nbsp; Finally, Jenner\r\n  Trucking contends the trial judge failed to apply the proper standard in\r\n  granting summary judgment to Pioneer.Â  We have determined that there are no\r\n  issues of material fact warranting the denial of summary judgment on any of the\r\n  specific issues involved in this appeal and likewise hold the trial judge did\r\n  not fail to apply the proper standard in granting summary judgment.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the grant to\r\n  summary judgment to Pioneer.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTHOMAS, PIEPER, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Section 36-2-316(1) reads as follows:Â  &quot;If the\r\n  agreement creates an express warranty words disclaiming it are\r\n  inoperative.&quot;Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-073","title":"Edwards v.

Â We affirm.[1]\r\nThe\r\n  sole allegation against the Toyota defendants was that the Toyota defendants\r\n  were negligent for selling and warranting that the airbag in a vehicle\r\n  purchased by Mr. and Mrs. Williams from the Toyota defendants would discharge\r\n  on impact.Â  Several years after Mr. and Mrs. Williams purchased the car, it was\r\n  involved in two collisions, first with another vehicle and immediately\r\n  thereafter with a tree; however, the airbag did not discharge either time, and\r\n  Mrs. Williams, who was driving the car, was injured.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  granting summary judgment to the Toyota defendants, the trial judge held Mr.\r\n  and Mrs. Williams were unable to prove any of the elements necessary for\r\n  establishing liability in a products liability action.Â  Specifically, the trial\r\n  judge held that the mere fact that the airbag did not discharge during upon\r\n  impact during either collision was insufficient evidence to establish a prima\r\n  facie case that the vehicle was defective. Â We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1),\r\n  SCACR, and the following authorities:Â  \r\n1.&nbsp; As to whether a\r\n  genuine issue of material fact existed regarding a defect in the airbag:Â  SeeÂ  Marchant v. Mitchell Distrib. Co., 270 S.C. 29, 36, 240 S.E.2d 511, 514 (1977) (stating\r\n  the fact that an injury occurred and the fact that the allegedly defective\r\n  product could have been more safe are not sufficient to support a finding that\r\n  the product in question was unreasonably dangerous); Campbell v. Robbins\r\n    Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 256 S.C. 230, 234, 182 S.E.2d 73, 75 (1971) (holding\r\n  the mere fact that a tire tube exploded &quot;does not demonstrate the\r\n  manufacturer's negligence nor tend to establish that the tube was defective&quot;)\r\n  (emphasis added); Bragg v.\r\n    Hi-Ranger, Inc., 319 S.C. 531, 543, 462 S.E.2d 321, 328 (Ct. App. 1995)\r\n  (stating that to prevail in a products liability action under a strict\r\n  liability theory, &quot;the plaintiff\r\n  must establish that: (1) the defendant's product was in a defective condition\r\n  unreasonably dangerous for its intended use; (2) the defect existed when the\r\n  product left the defendant's control; and (3) the defect was the proximate\r\n  cause of the injury sustained&quot;); id.

Dunlop Tire and Rubber Corp., 304 S.E.2d 773, 780 (N.C. Ct.\r\n  App. 1983) (affirming the grant of summary judgment for the defendant in a products\r\n  liability claim arising in South Carolina and holding that because (1) the\r\n  allegedly defective product could not be produced, (2) there was no expert\r\n  testimony or other evidence that it was defective, and (3) there was no\r\n  examination of the productÂ  by one who could make a meaningful evaluation, the\r\n  plaintiff failed to make a legally sufficient showing of a defective condition\r\n  or unreasonable danger under South Carolina law).\r\n2.&nbsp; Because we have affirmed the trial\r\n  judge's ruling that Mr. and Mrs. Williams failed as a matter of law to\r\n  establish that their vehicle was defective, we need not reach their argument\r\n  regarding causation.Â  See Futch v.

Sheppard appeals a circuit court's grant of\r\n  summary judgment to The LPA Group, Inc. (LPA) in Sheppard's action for wrongful\r\n  discharge.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nUnder Rule 56(c)\r\n  of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, &quot;[s]ummary judgment is\r\n  appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and it is clear\r\n  the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.&quot;Â  Hancock\r\n    v. Mid-South Mgmt. Co., Inc., 381 S.C. 326, 329, 673\r\n  S.E.2d 801, 802&nbsp;(2009) (citation omitted).Â  &quot;In determining whether any\r\n  triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all inferences which can be\r\n  reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\r\n  party.&quot;Â  Id. at 329-30, 673\r\n  S.E.2d at 802. Â \r\nSheppard\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to LPA because a\r\n  genuine issue of material fact existed whether LPA's employment handbook (the\r\n  Handbook) and oral explanation for Sheppard's termination altered his at-will\r\n  employment status such that LPA breached an employment contract when it fired\r\n  him for cause.Â  We disagree.Â  An at-will employee can\r\n  be fired &quot;at any time, for any reason or for no reason at all.Â  The\r\n  termination of an at-will employee normally does not give rise to cause of\r\n  action for breach of contract.&quot;Â  Small v. Springs Indus. Inc., 300\r\n  S.C. 481, 484, 388 S.E.2d 808, 810 (1990) (citations omitted).Â  However, an\r\n  employer's oral statement may alter an employee's at-will status if the\r\n  statement is &quot;an oral contract of definite employment.&quot;Â  Prescott\r\n    v. Farmers Tel. Co-op., Inc.,Â  335 S.C. 330, 336, 516 S.E.2d 923, 926\r\n  (1999).Â  This oral contract requires three elements: &quot;1) a specific offer,\r\n  2) communication of the offer to the employee, and 3) performance of job duties\r\n  in reliance on the offer.&quot;Â  Id. (citation omitted) Â Moreover,\r\n  certain handbook provisions may constitute promises that alter an employee's\r\n  at-will status, and these provisions may include mandatory, progressive\r\n  discipline procedures and general policy statements.Â  Connor v. City of\r\n    Forest Acres, 348 S.C. 454, 463, 560 S.E.2d 606, 611 (2002).Â  An employer's general\r\n  policy statements are enforceable as promises if &quot;definitive in nature,\r\n  promising specific treatment in specific situations.&quot;Â  Hessenthaler v.\r\n    Tri-County Sister Help, Inc., 365 S.C. 101, 110, 616 S.E.2d 694, 699 (2005).Â \r\n  If a handbook contains promissory language but the employer does not wish to\r\n  alter an employee's at-will status, &quot;the employer must insert a\r\n  conspicuous disclaimer into the handbook.&quot;Â  Grant v. Mount\r\n    Vernon Mills, Inc., 370 S.C. 138, 149-50, 634 S.E.2d 15, 21 (Ct. App. 2006)\r\n  (citation omitted).Â  &quot;[A] disclaimer appearing\r\n  in bold, capitalized letters, in a prominent position, is conspicuous&quot; as a matter of law.Â  Hessenthaler,\r\n  365 S.C. at 108, 616 S.E.2d at 697 (citation omitted). \r\nHere, neither the oral\r\n  statements nor the Handbook altered Sheppard's at-will status.Â  First, LPA's\r\n  oral explanation for Sheppard's termination did not constitute an offer made in\r\n  exchange for Sheppard's performance of his job duties.Â  Second, the Handbook\r\n  did not contain promissory language.Â  Sheppard conceded the Handbook did not\r\n  contain any mandatory, progressive discipline procedures, and the Handbook's\r\n  general policy statements entitled &quot;Behavior of Employees&quot; and &quot;Disciplinary\r\n  Procedures&quot; simply provided possible reasons for discipline.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  the Handbook contained a provision constituting an unambiguous, conspicuous disclaimer.Â \r\n  That provision's language clearly denied the Handbook altered Sheppard's\r\n  at-will status, and the provision was capitalized, set off with a border, and\r\n  placed on the page before the Handbook's table of contents.Â  Moreover, the\r\n  provision's title, &quot;Notice,&quot; was fully capitalized, underlined, and\r\n  bolded.Â  \r\nSheppard\r\n  also argues a genuine issue of material fact exists whether LPA breached a\r\n  covenant of good faith and fair dealing by firing Sheppard for cause. Â We\r\n  disagree.Â  The covenant of good faith and fair dealing does not apply to a\r\n  relationship between an employer and an at-will employee.Â  Williams v.\r\n    Riedman, 339 S.C. 251, 274, 529 S.E.2d 28, 40 (Ct. App. 2000) (citations\r\n  omitted).Â  Accordingly, the circuit court properly granted LPA summary\r\n  judgment on Sheppard's claim for wrongful discharge.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS, GEATHERS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-076","title":"Johnson v.

Nichols, both of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\n        Mary C. McCormac, of Clemson, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Willie\r\n  Johnson and other property owners in the Town of Iva (Appellants) appeal the\r\n  trial court's order granting summary judgment to the Town of Iva, Iva City\r\n  Council, and Mayor Bobby Gentry (Respondents).Â  We affirm as modified.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn November of 2001, vendors\r\n  contacted Shirley Powell, then Mayor of the Town, requesting late payment of\r\n  the Town's bills.Â  Upon her inquiry, Town Clerk Anthony Burdette claimed he\r\n  purchased items for his father-in-law's business using the Town's funds.Â \r\n  Powell further found the Town was in severe debt and did not have the revenue\r\n  coming in to cover expenses.Â  She requested an investigation and hired\r\n  certified public accountants to audit the Town for the fiscal year ending on\r\n  June 30, 2001.Â  The auditor found the Town's finances were poorly kept and\r\n  handled.Â  Due to several irregularities the auditor was unable to verify the\r\n  exact amount of money missing or pinpoint the wrongdoing.Â  The auditor\r\n  discovered the Town had an abundance of supplies it did not need and invoices\r\n  for merchandise it did not need.Â  Taxes, water bills, and insurance premiums\r\n  were not up to date.Â  In addition, people were allowed to make partial payments\r\n  on their utilities.Â  The auditor found the Town had not paid state retirement\r\n  since June 2000, had not paid federal and state withholding tax, had not filed\r\n  quarterly payroll tax reports for 2001, and had not paid police remittance of\r\n  fines to the state since October of 2000.Â  The Town had no cash to pay bills,\r\n  books had not been kept since October of 2000, property tax notices had not\r\n  been mailed, and other bills remained unpaid.Â  In addition, there was a\r\n  substantial problem with the cemetery funds.Â  \r\nIn order to alleviate its\r\n  financial problems, the Town passed an ordinance in February of 2002 increasing\r\n  the water and sewer bills.Â  It adopted an ordinance to increase the property\r\n  taxes by 21.1% in July 2002.Â  The increased property tax notices were mailed in\r\n  September and October 2002.Â  \r\nAppellants brought this\r\n  action against Respondents on May 5, 2005. They asserted causes of action for\r\n  negligence/gross negligence, civil conspiracy, fraud/misrepresentation,\r\n  constructive fraud, conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, negligent\r\n  supervision, and violation of the Freedom of Information Act.[1]Â \r\n  Respondents filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting, among other issues,\r\n  Respondents were immune from liability under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act\r\n  (the Act)[2] and the two-year statute of limitation for actions brought under the Act[3] had run.Â  Appellants asserted they had no notice of the Respondents' wrongdoing\r\n  until they received a copy of a report from the South Carolina Law Enforcement\r\n  Division (SLED) in early 2004 addressing the Town's alleged mismanagement.Â  \r\nThe trial court held Appellants'\r\n  claims were barred by the statute of limitations.Â  The trial court rejected Appellants'\r\n  argument that Respondents were estopped from asserting the statute of\r\n  limitations.Â  In addition, it found Respondents had not violated the Freedom of\r\n  Information Act.Â  It did not address Respondents' other issues.Â  Appellants\r\n  filed a motion to alter or amend, which the trial court denied.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants argue the trial\r\n  court erred in granting summary judgment on their claims.Â  We find Appellants'\r\n  claims fall within the Act's exceptions to the waiver of immunity and thus fail\r\n  as a matter of law.[4]Â  \r\nThe Act &quot;is the\r\n  exclusive and sole remedy for any tort committed by an employee of a\r\n  governmental entity while acting within the scope of the employee's official\r\n  duty.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-200 (2005).Â  The courts must liberally\r\n  construe the Act in favor of limiting the liability of the governmental\r\n  entity.Â  Id.Â  The Act sets forth several exceptions to the waiver of\r\n  liability.Â  It provides:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    governmental entity is not liable for a loss resulting from:\r\n  (1)\r\n    legislative, judicial, or quasi-judicial action or inaction; \r\n  (2)\r\n    administrative action or inaction of a legislative, judicial, or quasi-judicial\r\n    nature; \r\n  . . . .\r\n  Â (4)\r\n    adoption, enforcement, or compliance with any law or failure to adopt or\r\n    enforce any law, whether valid or invalid, including, but not limited to, any\r\n    charter, provision, ordinance, resolution, rule, regulation, or written\r\n    policies; \r\n  (5) the\r\n    exercise of discretion or judgment by the governmental entity or employee or\r\n    the performance or failure to perform any act or service which is in the\r\n    discretion or judgment of the governmental entity or employee; \r\n  . . . .\r\n  Â (11)\r\n    assessment or collection of taxes or special assessments or enforcement of tax\r\n    laws. . . . Â \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60\r\n  (2005) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nThe Act defines the word &quot;loss&quot;\r\n  as \r\n\r\n  bodily\r\n    injury, disease, death, or damage to tangible property, including lost wages\r\n    and economic loss to the person who suffered the injury, disease, or death,\r\n    pain and suffering, mental anguish, and any other element of actual damages\r\n    recoverable in actions for negligence, but does not include the intentional\r\n    infliction of emotional harm.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-30(f)\r\n  (2005).\r\nÂ Appellants asserted causes\r\n  of action for negligence/gross negligence, civil conspiracy,\r\n  fraud/misrepresentation, constructive fraud, conversion, breach of fiduciary\r\n  duty, and negligent supervision.Â  They insisted in their memorandum opposing\r\n  summary judgment that this is not a taxpayer action.Â  Thus, their claims are\r\n  subject to the Act.Â  However, the only economic &quot;loss&quot; Appellants\r\n  claim directly resulted from the increase in taxes and water/sewer bills.Â  Appellants\r\n  alleged:Â  &quot;As a result of the town's mismanagement, the town became\r\n  insolvent and citizens have been subjected to increased property taxes and\r\n  water and sewage bills.&quot;Â  The Town's enactment of ordinances increasing\r\n  the taxes and water/sewer bills falls within the above-listed exceptions to\r\n  liability.Â  We find the Act does not permit Appellants to establish tort\r\n  liability by looking toward the reasons the Town may have enacted these\r\n  ordinances when the enactment of the ordinances is clearly protected under the\r\n  Act. Â Accordingly, the Respondents are immune from Appellants' claims and\r\n  summary judgment was appropriate.Â  \r\nThe order of the trial court\r\n  granting Respondents' motion for summary judgment is \r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.Â  \r\nFEW, C.J., and HUFF and\r\n  GEATHERS, JJ. concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] S.C.
