White, of Moncks Corner, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this family court action, C. H. Doe (Grandfather) appeals the family\r\n  courtâ€™s order removing his grandson, A. J. Poe, Jr. (Grandson), from his\r\n  custody.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThe following facts were developed during the contested merits hearing on\r\n  May 15, 2006.Â  Grandson was born on\r\n  September 24, 1993,[2] and resided with Grandfather from that time until March 2004, when officers\r\n  arrested Grandfather for fondling a neighborâ€™s child. Â At that time, the Department of Social\r\n  Services (DSS) took Grandson into protective custody.Â  A report given to Jocelyn Multry, Grandsonâ€™s case manager, stated Grandson was\r\n  molested by Grandfather who touched his genitals and that when Grandson urinated his genitals burned.Â \r\n \r\nInitially, Grandson did not reveal any of the sexual abuse, and he was\r\n  referred to Low Country Childrenâ€™s Center.Â  It was not until almost a year later that Grandson began to talk\r\n  about being sexually abused by Grandfather. Â By that point in time, Grandson had been\r\n  sexually abused while in foster care.Â  Â Â Â \r\nGrandson testified Grandfather put his penis in Grandsonâ€™s buttocks and\r\n  that Grandfather touched him inappropriately.Â  Grandson also stated Grandfather took\r\n  pictures of him while he was naked.Â  Â \r\nGrandfather denied ever sexually abusing Grandson.Â  He testified Grandson lied and that DSS\r\n  coerced him into making false statements.Â  Grandfather explained the only time he touched Grandson was when he\r\n  was about five years old because he had issues with wiping himself after going\r\n  to the bathroom. Â Â As to the\r\n  allegations regarding the burning sensation while Grandson urinated,\r\n  Grandfather stated he gave him a bath in diluted bleach and when Grandson\r\n  urinated in the tub the ammonia and bleach mixed together.[3]Â  Grandfather also stated that he then\r\n  put Vaseline on Grandsonâ€™s hand and told him to apply it to his burning genital\r\n  area. Â Â \r\nAfter the hearing, the family court issued its order.Â  The order prohibited Grandfather from\r\n  having any contact with Grandson.Â  Further,\r\n  the family court found reunification was not in Grandsonâ€™s best interest and,\r\n  therefore, did not recommend any services be provided to Grandfather.Â  The family court ordered Grandfatherâ€™s\r\n  name to be placed in the central registry of child abuse and neglect due to his\r\n  sexual abuse of Grandson.Â  Â The family court retained jurisdiction to\r\n  review the treatment plan with respect to possibly placing Grandson with his\r\n  biological mother.Â  Â The family court noted Grandfatherâ€™s objection\r\n  to the treatment/placement plan.Â  Although\r\n  Grandfatherâ€™s brief states that his custodial rights â€œwere terminated,â€ no\r\n  formal termination of parental rights action has yet occurred.Â  Grandfather appeals the order of removal.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe family court shall not order the removal of a child â€œunless\r\n  the court finds that the allegations of the petition are supported by a\r\n  preponderance of evidence including a finding that the child is abused or\r\n  neglected. . . .â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-736 (Supp. 2006).Â  Â â€œIn\r\n  appeals from the family court, this court may find facts in accordance with its\r\n  own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Nasser-Moghaddassi v. Moghaddassi, 364 S.C.182, 189, 612 S.E.2d 707, 711 (\r\n  \r\n      \r\n  Ct. App. 2005) (citation\r\n  omitted).Â  â€œOur broad scope of\r\n  review does not require us to disregard the findings below or ignore the fact\r\n  the trial judge was in a better position to asses the credibility of the\r\n  witnesses.â€Â  S.C.\r\n    Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings,\r\n  345 S.C. 288, 293, 547 S.E.2d 506, 509 (Ct. App. 2001) (citing Dorchester\r\n    County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C.\r\n  445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996)).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGrandfather argues the family court erred in removing Grandson\r\n  after finding Grandson was abused or neglected under section 20-7-490 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006).Â  We\r\n  disagree. Â \r\nInitially, Grandfather argues DSS failed to raise\r\n  allegations of sexual abuse against him prior to the contested merits hearing.Â  Grandfather contends the complaint only\r\n  alleged sexual abuse regarding the neighborâ€™s child rather than sexual abuse\r\n  against Grandson.Â  Therefore, he avers\r\n  his due process rights were violated because he was unaware that sexual abuse\r\n  regarding Grandson would be an issue at the hearing.Â Â Â  We disagree.\r\nAs a threshold matter, this argument is not preserved for our\r\n  review.Â  To preserve an issue for\r\n  appellate review, the issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but\r\n  must have been raised to and ruled upon by the family court.Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n      Charleston\r\n      \r\n        County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Jackson,&nbsp;368\r\n  S.C. 87, 104-05, 627 S.E.2d 765, 775&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006) (citing Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543,\r\n  546 (2000) (â€œIt is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first\r\n  time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court\r\n  to be preserved for appellate review.â€)).Â  Grandfather did not raise this issue to the family court.Â  Therefore, this issue is not preserved for\r\n  our review.\r\nEven if the issue were properly before us, we find no merit\r\n  to the argument because Grandfatherâ€™s sexual abuse regarding Grandson was tried\r\n  by consent.Â  See Woods v. Rabon, 295 S.C. 343, 347, 368 S.E.2d 471, 474 (Ct. App.\r\n  1988) (â€œIf neither party timely objects to evidence raising issues not pleaded,\r\n  each is deemed impliedly to consent to the trial of such issues.â€). When Grandson\r\n  testified regarding Grandfatherâ€™s sexual abuse, Grandfather did not object to\r\n  the testimony on this point.Â  In addition, during his testimony,\r\n  Grandfather explicitly denied ever having sexually abused Grandson and addressed\r\n  the allegations raised during Grandsonâ€™s testimony.Â  Therefore, Grandfather consented to trying\r\n  the issue of his sexual abuse of Grandson.Â  Further, the complaint for removal put Grandfather on sufficient notice\r\n  that allegations of sexual abuse regarding Grandson would be an issue during\r\n  the hearing.Â  The complaint alleged\r\n  Grandfather â€œsexually abused and physically neglected the minor child . . . .â€Â  The\r\n  complaint also stated Grandfather â€œwould touch the minor child . . . buttocks\r\n  once he used the bathroom because of his function level.â€Â  Â Accordingly, Grandfather was fully apprised of\r\n  the sexual abuse charges against him and we find no merit to Grandfatherâ€™s\r\n  argument on this point.\r\nNext, Grandfather argues the evidence fails to support the\r\n  family courtâ€™s finding of sexual abuse under section 20-7-490.Â  He contends the only evidence at trial that\r\n  he sexually abused Grandson was Grandsonâ€™s own testimony during the\r\n  hearing.Â  Grandfather maintains because Grandson\r\n  waited so long after removal before disclosing the abuse that Grandson was\r\n  somehow coerced into making the allegations.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 20-7-490 provides a child is abused or neglected\r\n  when a person responsible for a child â€œcommits or allows to be committed against the child a sexual offense as defined by laws of this state.\r\n  . . .â€ Â The evidence presented during the\r\n  hearing shows that Grandfather did sexually abuse Grandson. Grandson testified\r\n  at length to the sexual abuse he suffered.Â  He also testified that initially he was afraid to disclose the abuse\r\n  because he was afraid of his Grandfather.Â  Further, Mary Green, Grandsonâ€™s\r\n  therapist, testified that in most sexual abuse cases, children do not reveal\r\n  the abuse until some time later. Â \r\nIn addition, the order of the family court shows it\r\n  considered the fact Grandfather disputed Grandsonâ€™s allegations against him.Â  The order references Grandfatherâ€™s belief\r\n  Grandson was lying and finds Grandsonâ€™s testimony â€œto be extremely credible.â€Â  Therefore,\r\n  Grandfatherâ€™s theory that Grandson was fabricating the sexual abuse allegations\r\n  was at issue during the hearing.Â  The\r\n  family court heard and weighed the testimony, including the fact Grandfatherâ€™s own witness testified that he believed\r\n  Grandson was an honest child.Â  Â Accordingly,\r\n  the preponderance of the evidence supports the family courtâ€™s conclusion that\r\n  Grandfather sexually abused Grandson and the family court properly removed\r\n  Grandson from Grandfatherâ€™s custody.Â   \r\nTherefore,\r\n  the order of the family court is  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL,\r\n  SHORT, and WILLIAMS JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] On June 8, 1999, the family court\r\n  awarded Grandfather sole custody of Grandson. Â Â \r\n[3] The record is unclear as to whether Grandfather did\r\n  this because of red bug bites or because he believed â€œbleach cures practically\r\n  anything.â€  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-404","title":"Dew v.

McElveen, Jr., of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This\r\n  action originated from a workersâ€™ compensation claim filed by Willie Joe Dew\r\n  against his employer, Santee Cooper.Â  Santee Cooper appeals the decision of the\r\n  Appellate Panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission, which found Dewâ€™s\r\n  injuries to his right knee and back were compensable and ordered payment by\r\n  lump sum to be allocated over Dewâ€™s lifetime.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  April 30, 2001, Dew was in the process of loading two vehicles onto a low-boy trailer\r\n  when his right leg gave way causing him to fall backwards off the trailer.Â  The\r\n  low-boy trailer was approximately three and one half feet tall.Â  Dew worked about\r\n  three hours prior to the accident on April 30th.Â   \r\nFollowing\r\n  his fall, Dew went to the emergency room, which recorded right knee and right\r\n  hip injuries.Â  Santee Cooperâ€™s physician, Dr. Marcus Schaefer, examined Dew on\r\n  the day of the fall.Â  Dr. Schaefer recorded that Dew fell backwards off of the\r\n  low-boy and diagnosed him with a right knee strain, a right hip strain, and a\r\n  contusion.Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nThe first report for Workersâ€™\r\n  Compensation, Form 12A, was submitted following the accident.Â  Subsequently,\r\n  Dew received temporary compensation, which was interrupted multiple times when\r\n  Dew attempted to return to work.Â  Dew filed a claim by submitting a Form 50 on April\r\n  25, 2003, which listed injuries to his back, right leg, right hip, and right\r\n  testicle, as well as psychological effects from the fall on April 30, 2001.Â \r\n  Santee Cooper filed a Form 21, requesting a hearing to stop payment of\r\n  compensation.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  single commissioner held a hearing on November 14, 2003.Â  The single\r\n  commissioner concluded Dew was totally and permanently disabled under sections\r\n  42-9-10 and 42-9-30 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2002).Â  The single\r\n  commissioner ordered Santee Cooper to pay Dew a lump sum payment, not to exceed\r\n  a total of five hundred weeks of compensation.Â  The order allocated the lump\r\n  sum payment to Dew over his lifetime.Â   \r\nSantee\r\n  Cooper requested the Appellate Panel review the single commissionerâ€™s order,\r\n  citing forty-five exceptions.Â  The Appellant Panel affirmed the single\r\n  commissioner and adopted her order in full.Â   \r\nSantee\r\n  Cooper then appealed the Appellate Panelâ€™s order to the circuit court.Â  The\r\n  circuit court affirmed the Appellate Panel.Â  This appeal follows.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  findings of an administrative agency, such as the Appellate Panel, are presumed\r\n  correct and will only be set aside if unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  Rodney\r\n    v. Michelin Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 515, 519, 466 S.E.2d 357,\r\n  359&nbsp;(1996).Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is evidence which, considering the\r\n  record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that\r\n  the administrative agency reached.â€Â  Gibson v. Florence Country Club,\r\n  282 S.C. 384, 386, 318 S.E.2d 365, 367&nbsp;(1984) (internal quotations omitted).\r\nWhen\r\n  conflicting medical evidence is presented, the Appellate\r\n  Panelâ€™s findings of fact are conclusive.Â  Grayson v. Carter Rhoad Furniture,&nbsp;317\r\n  S.C. 306, 309, 454 S.E.2d 320, 321-22 (1995).Â  The duty to determine facts is\r\n  placed solely on the Appellate Panel, and the court reviewing the decision of\r\n  the Appellate Panel has no authority to determine factual issues but must\r\n  remand the matter to the Appellate Panel for further proceedings if necessary. Â Fox\r\n    v. Newberry County Memâ€™l Hosp.,&nbsp;319 S.C. 278, 280, 461 S.E.2d 392,\r\n  394&nbsp;(1995).Â   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Right Knee Injury\r\nSantee\r\n  Cooper argues the Appellate Panel erred regarding Dewâ€™s right knee for three\r\n  reasons: 1) by holding compensation for Dewâ€™s right knee injury was properly\r\n  before the Appellate Panel; 2) by failing to find Dewâ€™s right knee injury was\r\n  time barred; and 3) by finding substantial evidence supported Dewâ€™s claim for\r\n  his right knee.Â  We disagree.\r\na.\r\n  The Compensation Issue Was Properly Before The Appellate Panel\r\nSantee\r\n  Cooper submits because Dew â€œnever legally claimed any entitlement to benefits\r\n  for his knee or leg,â€ the issue was not before the Appellate Panel.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nIn his\r\n  Form 50, a workersâ€™ compensation form used to file a claim, Dew listed his\r\n  back, right leg, and right hip as injuries sustained from the April 30, 2001\r\n  accident.Â  Additionally, Dew testified before the single commissioner that on\r\n  the day of the accident his right leg â€œwent awayâ€ and he fell onto his back.Â \r\n  On the day of the fall, Santee\r\n  Cooperâ€™s doctor diagnosed Dew with a right knee strain, a right hip strain, and\r\n  a contusion.Â  Therefore, Dew presented sufficient evidence to place his right\r\n  knee injury properly before the Appellate Panel.Â Â Â   \r\nb.\r\n  Dewâ€™s Claim Is Not Time Barred\r\nSantee Cooper\r\n  alleges Dewâ€™s claim for his right knee injury is time barred under section\r\n  42-15-40 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006).Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 42-15-40 states,\r\n  â€œThe right to compensation under this title is barred unless a claim\r\n  is filed with the commission within two years after an accident . . . .â€\r\nThe accident\r\n  occurred on April 30, 2001, and Dew filed his Form 50 on April 25, 2003.Â  The\r\n  Form 50 states Dew â€œsustained an accidental injury to his back, right leg,\r\n  [and] right hip.â€Â  Further, Dew notes on the form that he fell when his leg\r\n  gave way.Â  Additionally, the Form 50 states Dew was filing the form as a\r\n  claim.Â  Therefore, Dew followed section 42-15-40 by filing a claim for his\r\n  right knee within the statutory time limit.Â   \r\nc.\r\n  Substantial Evidence Supports The Appellate Panelâ€™s Finding \r\nSantee Cooper\r\n  argues substantial evidence does not support the Appellate Panelâ€™s finding that\r\n  Dewâ€™s right knee was injured by an accident arising out of Dewâ€™s employment.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nSubstantial\r\n  evidence is defined as evidence that would allow reasonable minds to reach the\r\n  same conclusion as the Appellate Panel.Â  Gibson, 282 S.C. at 386, 318\r\n  S.E.2d at 367.Â  Additionally, â€œthe trier of fact [which is the Appellate Panel]\r\n  is not necessarily bound by, and need not accept or believe, medical or other\r\n  expert testimony, even when it is unanimous, uncontroverted, or\r\n  uncontradicted.â€Â  100A C.J.S. Workersâ€™ Compensation Â§1023 (2000). \r\n \r\nDew testified at\r\n  trial that on April 30, 2001, his â€œright leg went awayâ€ causing him to fall.Â  Dr.\r\n  Preston B. Fitzgerald, a chiropractor, determined to a reasonable degree of\r\n  chiropractic orthopedic probability the injuries Dew suffered were from the\r\n  April 30, 2001 accident.Â  Dr. Stephen Rawe noted that Dew â€œsustained a work\r\n  related injury on 4/30/01.â€Â  Additionally, Dr. Schaefer, the company doctor,\r\n  noted, â€œI do not believe [Dewâ€™s] knee injury is work related, but [it] can\r\n  be.â€Â  Therefore, substantial evidence supports finding Dewâ€™s right knee was\r\n  injured by the April 30, 2001 accident.  \r\nSantee Cooper\r\n  further disputes the causation of Dewâ€™s knee injury by noting Dew saw Dr.\r\n  Fitzgerald prior to the accident complaining of knee pain.Â   \r\nIn Gordon\r\n  v. E. I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co., the South Carolina Supreme Court\r\n  stated that a latent or quiescent weakened, but not disabling, condition resulting\r\n  from disease or previous accidental injury that is aggravated, accelerated, or\r\n  activated within the course of employment may result in a compensable disability.Â \r\n  228 S.C. 67, 76, 88 S.E.2d 844, 848 (1955).\r\nPrior to the\r\n  accident, Dewâ€™s knee bothered him for a number of years following an incident\r\n  when he jumped over a ditch.Â  On April 16, 2001, Dew saw Dr. Fitzgerald\r\n  regarding pain in his right knee.Â  Dr. Fitzgerald referred Dew to an\r\n  orthopedist, whom Dew saw on April 20, 2001.Â  An MRI was performed on Dewâ€™s\r\n  right knee on April 27, 2001.Â  The radiologist, Dr. Robin Daum-Kowalski,\r\n  concluded Dewâ€™s right knee had a lateral meniscal tear with related separation,\r\n  joint effusion, and a medial meniscal signal without a tear.Â   \r\nDr. George Dawson\r\n  and Dr. Robert Eagerton signed documents instructing Dew to return to full-duty\r\n  work on April 30, 2001, the date of the accident.Â  Additionally, Dr. Marcus\r\n  Schaefer recorded that Dewâ€™s knee completely gave out on the day of the\r\n  accident for the first time and subsequently gave out four additional times.Â \r\n \r\n\r\n\tThe Appellate Panelâ€™s\r\n  adopted order explains:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tThe\r\n  Claimantâ€™s accident aggravated his pre-existing condition to his knee. . . .Â \r\n  Although the knee would have required surgery even without the accident, the\r\n  fact is that everyone reasonably believed on the date of injury that Claimant\r\n  was able to work with no restrictions. . . . Claimant worked several hours,\r\n  putting considerable strain on his right leg and knee.Â  The knee â€œgave awayâ€, (sic)\r\n  causing him to fall. Â Under the circumstances of this claim, the back and right\r\n  leg injuries both arose out of and in the course of employment.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe Appellate Panelâ€™s\r\n  finding that Dewâ€™s knee injury arose out of an accident within his scope of\r\n  employment is supported by substantial evidence and, therefore, is not\r\n  reversible error.Â   \r\nII. Total Disability\r\nSantee Cooper\r\n  argues the Appellate Panel erred in finding Dew is entitled to benefits for\r\n  permanent and total disability under sections 42-9-10 and 42-9-30 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) due to a lack of evidentiary support and the applicable\r\n  law.[1] Â We disagree.\r\nIn Wigfall\r\n  v. Tideland Util., Inc., the South Carolina Supreme Court interpreted section\r\n  42-9-10.Â  Our Supreme Court elucidated three ways a claimant may obtain total\r\n  disability: (1) by demonstrating one of the injuries designated as total\r\n  disabilities in section 42-9-10; (2) by showing a nonscheduled injury under\r\n  section 42-9-30, which caused such a loss in earning capacity to make the\r\n  claimant totally disabled; and (3) by suffering a section 42-9-30 scheduled\r\n  injury and an additional injury to his body.Â  354 S.C. 100, 105-06, 580 S.E.2d\r\n  100, 102-03 (2003).Â  This third option is explored below.\r\nIn Singleton\r\n  v. Young Lumber Co., 236 S.C. 454, 471,&nbsp;114 S.E.2d 837,\r\n  845&nbsp;(1960), our Supreme Court stated:\r\n\r\n\tWhere\r\n  the injury is confined to the scheduled member, and there is no impairment of\r\n  any other part of the body because of such injury, the employee is limited to\r\n  the scheduled compensation, even though other considerations such as age, lack\r\n  of training, or other conditions peculiar to the individual, effect (sic) a\r\n  total or partial industrial incapacity. To obtain compensation in addition to\r\n  that scheduled for the injured member, claimant must show that some other part\r\n  of his body is affected.\r\n\r\nSection\r\n  42-9-30 lists various injuries and the amount and period of payments for the\r\n  corresponding scheduled injuries.Â  Section 42-9-30(19) lists the following\r\n  scheduled injury:\r\n\r\n\tFor the total loss of use of the back, sixty-six and two-thirds\r\n  percent of the average weekly wages during three hundred weeks. The\r\n  compensation for partial loss of use of the back shall be such proportions of\r\n  the periods of payment herein provided for total loss as such partial loss\r\n  bears to total loss, except that in cases where there is fifty percent or more\r\n  loss of use of the back, in which event the injured employee shall be deemed to\r\n  have suffered total and permanent disability and compensated therefor under\r\n  paragraph two of Â§ 42-9-10.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  evidence regarding Dewâ€™s injuries does not need to come solely from doctors.Â \r\n  â€œUnless the question of the extent of partial loss of use under Code Â§ 42-9-30\r\n  is so technically complicated as to require exclusively expert testimony, lay\r\n  testimony is admissible.â€Â  Linen v. Ruscon Constr. Co.,&nbsp;286 S.C.\r\n  67, 68, 332 S.E.2d 211, 212&nbsp;(1985).Â  Additionally, â€œ[t]he commission may find a degree of disability different from that\r\n  suggested by expert testimony.â€Â  Lyles v. Quantum Chem. Co.\r\n    (Emery), 315 S.C. 440, 445, 434 S.E.2d 292, 295&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\n \r\nIn\r\n  the case at hand, Dr. W. S. Edwards, Jr. used his experience rather than the guidelines\r\n  to determine Dew had a 10% back impairment.Â  Dr. Rawe believed Dew suffered a\r\n  5% back impairment.Â  Dr. Edwards further stated that Dew should not repeatedly\r\n  lift anything, even if the item only weighed five pounds.Â  Also, Dew was not to\r\n  sit or stand for extended periods of time.Â  Dew testified regarding his pain\r\n  and his difficulty in accomplishing normal tasks such as driving or regular\r\n  hygiene practices.Â   \r\nRegardless\r\n  of whether the Appellate Panelâ€™s assessment that Dew sustained greater than 50%\r\n  impairment to his back is correct, Dew suffered a back injury on April 30, 2001,\r\n  within the scope of his employment.Â  Therefore, substantial evidence exists in\r\n  the record that Dew suffered impairment to his back, which is a scheduled\r\n  injury under section 42-9-30(19).\r\nNow\r\n  that a section 42-9-30 schedule injury has been established, this Court again\r\n  turns to Wigfall and section 42-9-10.Â  Under Wigfall, a claimant\r\n  may recover total disability if he suffered a section 42-9-30 scheduled injury\r\n  and an additional injury to his body.Â  Wigfall, 354 S.C. at 105-06, 580\r\n  S.E.2d at 102-03.Â  As discussed above, Dew suffered his scheduled back injury\r\n  and an additional injury to his knee during the accident.Â  Therefore, the\r\n  Appellate Panel did not err by finding Dew suffered total disability.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we need not address any remaining\r\n  issues regarding Dewâ€™s injury rating.Â  See Rule 220(c), SCACR (â€œThe\r\n  appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, or judgment upon any ground(s)\r\n  appearing in the Record on Appeal.â€).\r\nIII. Loss of Use Factors\r\nSantee\r\n  Cooper argues the Appellate Panel erred in determining Dew sustained a greater\r\n  than 50% loss of use to his back because the Appellate Panelâ€™s order considers\r\n  factors outside of the medical model.Â  We decline to reach this issue as the\r\n  above determination of total disability is dispositive.Â  Hagood v.\r\n    Sommerville, 362 S.C. 191, 199, 607 S.E.2d 707, 711&nbsp;(2005) (stating an\r\n  appellate court need not reach remaining issues when an issue is dispositive).\r\nIV. Payment of\r\n  Compensation\r\nSantee Cooper\r\n  contests the Appellate Panelâ€™s allocation of Dewâ€™s compensation in a lump sum to\r\n  be paid over Dewâ€™s lifetime by arguing the payment method circumvents federal\r\n  law governing social security disability benefits.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 42-9-301 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (1976) provides a specialized scope of review for\r\n  appellate courts when determining if the Appellate Panel properly granted a\r\n  lump sum payment.Â  This applicable scope of review is whether the Appellate\r\n  Panel abused its discretion.Â  Thompson v. S.C. Steel Erectors, 369 S.C.\r\n  606, 612, 632 S.E.2d 874, 878&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).\r\n\r\n\tFurther, section\r\n  42-9-301 states:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tWhenever\r\n  any weekly payment has been continued for not less than six weeks, the\r\n  liability therefor may, when the employee so requests and the commission deems\r\n  it not to be contrary to the best interest of the employee or his dependents,\r\n  or when it will prevent undue hardship on the employer or his insurance\r\n  carrier, without prejudicing the interest of the employee or his dependents, be\r\n  redeemed, in whole or in part, by the payment by the employer of a lump sum\r\n  which shall be fixed by the commission . . . . \r\n\t\r\n\r\nSection 42-9-10 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) limits compensation to five hundred weeks\r\n  and prohibits lump sum payments for a person entitled to lifetime benefits,\r\n  such as paraplegics, quadriplegics, or individuals with physical brain damage.\r\nIn this case, the\r\n  Appellate Panelâ€™s order grants Dew a lump sum payment of his workerâ€™s\r\n  compensation benefits not to exceed 500 weeks.Â  Once the appropriate lump sum\r\n  is determined, the order provides this lump sum should be allocated to Dew for\r\n  the remainder of his life expectancy, which totaled 25.36 years.Â  The Appellate\r\n  Panel found no evidence indicating Santee Cooper would be prejudiced by making\r\n  the lump sum payment.Â   \r\nWe\r\n  hold that the Appellate Panel did not abuse its discretion in providing Dew a\r\n  lump sum payment to be allocated over the remainder of his life expectancy.Â \r\n  Santee Cooper is not prejudiced because it still compensates Dew for 500 weeks,\r\n  the maximum time period.Â  Dew may receive this payment in a lump sum, which may\r\n  even be allocated over a longer period of time; however, Santee Cooper pays the\r\n  same amount regardless of the method the Appellate Panel believed best served\r\n  Dew.  \r\nSantee Cooperâ€™s main\r\n  criticism of the order regarding payment hinges on an allegation that this\r\n  method proscribed by the Appellate Panelâ€™s adopted order improperly affects\r\n  Dewâ€™s potential Social Security benefits.Â   \r\nRule\r\n  201(b), SCACR, states, â€œOnly a party aggrieved by an order, judgment, or sentence may\r\n  appeal.â€Â  Santee Cooper is not an aggrieved party.Â  A party is\r\n  aggrieved if a judgment or order bears directly on his or her interest.Â  Shaw\r\n    v. City of Charleston, 351 S.C. 32, 36-37, 567 S.E.2d 530, 532 (Ct. App.\r\n  2002) (â€œThe word â€˜aggrievedâ€™ refers to a substantial grievance, a denial\r\n  of some personal or property right, or the imposition on a party of a burden or\r\n  obligation.Â  An aggrieved party or person is one who is injured\r\n  in a legal sense; one who has suffered an injury to person or property.â€) Â Â (internal quotations and citations omitted).Â  Consequently, a party which is\r\n  not aggrieved by a courtâ€™s decision is prohibited from bringing an appeal.Â \r\n  This is true even if the courtâ€™s decision may be erroneous and\r\n  prejudicial to some other personâ€™s rights and interests.Â  Id.\r\nIn\r\n  the present case, even if we assumed the decision below somehow improperly\r\n  affects Dewâ€™s Social Security benefits, this in no way affects Santee Cooperâ€™s\r\n  interests.Â  Thus, Santee Cooper is not an aggrieved party.Â  Other\r\n  considerations prevent us from adjudicating Santee Cooperâ€™s claim.Â   \r\nâ€œThe\r\n  function of appellate courts is not to give opinions on merely abstract or\r\n  theoretical matters, but only to decide actual controversies injuriously\r\n  affecting the rights of some party to the litigation.â€ Sloan v. Greenville County, 356 S.C. 531, 552, 590 S.E.2d 338, 349 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  An\r\n  appellate court examines justiciable controversies, which are real and substantial\r\n  controversies, which are ripe and appropriate for judicial determination instead\r\n  of merely contingent, hypothetical, or abstract disputes.Â  Spivey ex rel.\r\n    Spivey v. Carolina Crawler, 367 S.C. 154, 160, 624 S.E.2d 435, 438&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 2005).Â  Therefore, issues that are not ripe are not appropriately before\r\n  this Court.Â  Id.\r\nThis\r\n  issue is not yet ripe.Â  Dew does not receive Social Security disability\r\n  benefits at the present time.Â  If Dew does apply for such benefits, the Social\r\n  Security Administration will be charged with the determination of any\r\n  applicable set-offs.Â   \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  to institute an action a plaintiff must first have standing. Â Joytime\r\n    Distribs. &amp; Amusement Co. v. State, 338 S.C. 634, 639, 528 S.E.2d 647, 649 (1999).Â \r\n  â€œTo have standing, one must have a personal stake in the subject\r\n  matter of the lawsuit, i.e., one must be a real party in interest.â€Â  Charleston\r\n    County Sch. Dist. v. Charleston County Election Commâ€™n,&nbsp;336 S.C. 174,\r\n  181, 519 S.E.2d 567, 571&nbsp;(1999).Â  â€œA real party in interest is one who has\r\n  a real, material, or substantial interest in the subject matter of the action,\r\n  as opposed to one who has only a nominal or technical interest in the action.â€Â  Anchor Point, Inc. v. Shoals Sewer Co., 308 S.C. 422, 428, 418 S.E.2d\r\n  546, 549&nbsp;(1992).Â   \r\nFor\r\n  a plaintiff to have taxpayer standing,\r\n  the party must demonstrate some overriding public purpose or concern to confer standing to sue on behalf of his\r\n  or her fellow taxpayers.Â  Sloan, 356 S.C. at 549, 590 S.E.2d at 347-48.Â \r\n  Further, taxpayer standing developed from taxpayers suing municipalities, not a\r\n  former employee.Â  See id.; Beaufort County v. Trask, 349 S.C. 522, 529-30, 563 S.E.2d 660, 664 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2002).\r\nSantee\r\n  Cooper lacks standing to bring this issue.Â  Merely being a taxpayer does not\r\n  create standing to challenge the Appellate Panelâ€™s adopted order as Santee\r\n  Cooper was not personally injured by the Appellate Panelâ€™s adopted order.Â  Therefore,\r\n  the Appellate Panelâ€™s disposition of Dewâ€™s compensation does not create any\r\n  justiciable controversy in this case, and the Appellate Panel did not abuse its\r\n  discretion.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nDewâ€™s knee injury was properly before the Appellate\r\n  Panel, and substantial evidence supported the Appellate Panelâ€™s finding that Dew\r\n  injured his knee and his back during the course of his employment.Â  This dual\r\n  injury allowed the Appellate Panel to find Dew was permanently and totally\r\n  disabled.Â  Further, the Appellate Panel did not abuse its discretion in its\r\n  determination of appropriate compensation payments for Dew.Â   \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s rulings are  \r\nAFFIRMED. [2]\r\nSTILWELL,\r\n  SHORT, AND WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The South Carolina General Assembly recently amended South Carolinaâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation laws.Â  These statutory changes affect claims for\r\n  injuries occurring on or after July 1, 2007.Â  See 2007 S.C.

Clark appeals the denial of his petition for post-conviction relief (PCR).Â \r\n  We affirm.[1]Â   \r\nBACKGROUND FACTS\r\nOn\r\n  June 16, 1998, Cosette Lemon arrived at her apartment at about 11:15 p.m. Â As\r\n  she entered her home with a hamper of clothes, she pushed the door closed, but\r\n  did not get it shut all the way. Â She put the hamper down in her living room\r\n  and then went to lower some blinds.Â  She heard a sound at the door, but thought\r\n  it was her boyfriend, Terry Shackett who usually came home from work about that\r\n  time.Â  As she turned, she saw the profile of a man standing in the door.Â  The\r\n  man told Lemon her boyfriend told him to come on in.Â  As Lemon looked toward\r\n  the kitchen, the man grabbed her, jerked her around, and shoved her face down\r\n  into the couch.Â  He pulled her up off the couch and told her they were going to\r\n  the bedroom.Â  He pushed her down on the bed and was choking her.Â  He grabbed a\r\n  pillow case and told her to put it in her mouth.Â  He then tied it behind her\r\n  head and instructed her to put her hands behind her back and tied her hands.Â \r\n  He also tied her ankles together.Â  He asked Lemon if she had any money and told\r\n  her he might have to cut her if she lied.Â  About that time, Lemon heard someone\r\n  at the door.Â  Lemon heard the intruder running and called out to her boyfriend\r\n  to warn him.Â  After she was able to free herself, she ran into the kitchen, and\r\n  saw her boyfriend chasing the man around the corner of the building.\r\nShackett\r\n  testified he arrived at the apartment he shared with Lemon at about 11:25.Â \r\n  When he opened the screen door, he noticed the main door was open and realized\r\n  something was not right.Â  Suddenly, the door jerked open and he saw a black\r\n  male standing in the doorway.Â  Shackett grabbed the man, and the intruder\r\n  pushed Shackett to the side and began running.Â  Shackett gave chase, but was\r\n  unable to keep up with the intruder.  \r\nLemon\r\n  described the intruder to police as a light-skinned black man with short hair,\r\n  between twenty and thirty years old, weighing around one hundred and\r\n  seventy-five pounds and about five-nine or five-ten in height.Â  The day after\r\n  the incident, Lemon and Shackett went to the police station and helped put\r\n  together a composite by use of an identi-kit.[2] Â They were not satisfied with the results of that composite, and later met with\r\n  a sketch artist and put a new composite together.Â  Both Lemon and Shackett felt\r\n  the sketch artistâ€™s composite looked very similar to the intruder.  \r\nFour\r\n  or five nights after the incident, Lemon and Shackett were shown two different\r\n  photo lineups.Â  Lemon was unable to identify anyone from the first lineup.Â  In\r\n  the second one, she indicated one of the individuals looked more similar than\r\n  any of the others, but she was not able to make a positive identification. Â Shackett\r\n  likewise picked one individual from one of the lineups as looking similar to\r\n  the intruder, but was not sure.Â  Both Lemon and Shackett had pointed out the\r\n  same person\r\nUsing\r\n  the sketch artistâ€™s composite, the police began a surveillance of the area near\r\n  Lemonâ€™s apartment.Â  On the evening of June 24, officers observed a black male who\r\n  looked just like the composite walking in the area.Â  That person was identified\r\n  in court as Clark.Â  Clarkâ€™s picture was then placed in a third photographic lineup\r\n  and was shown to both Lemon and Shackett. Â Lemon felt strongly that Clarkâ€™s picture looked like the suspect, but she could not be absolutely sure.Â  Lemon\r\n  indicated she had seen the intruderâ€™s profile, and because it was dark and she\r\n  had only seen his face for a few seconds, she felt she could better identify\r\n  someone if she saw him in person.Â  However, the police informed her they could\r\n  not do that.Â  When Shackett was shown the third lineup, he immediately picked\r\n  out Clark as the intruder. Â He testified he had no doubt this was the person.Â \r\n  He then made an in-court identification of Clark as the intruder.Â   \r\nLemon\r\n  testified she went to Clarkâ€™s bond hearing, and at that time she observed Clark facing exactly the way he was in her apartment.Â  She stated she was looking at the\r\n  floor when she realized there was a man in shackles standing there.Â  When she\r\n  looked up and saw him facing that way, a chill went over her, and she realized\r\n  it was the intruder.Â  She testified she did not realize Clark would be at the bond\r\n  hearing, and when she looked up and saw him, it caught her by surprise.Â  Lemon\r\n  identified Clark in court as the person who was in her apartment that night. \r\n \r\nThe\r\n  evidence of record shows Clark was actually thirty-eight or thirty-nine years\r\n  old, was about five feet five inches tall and weighed approximately one hundred\r\n  and thirty-eight pounds.Â  The officer who arrested him testified, however, Clark did not look his age and he looked heavier than his actual weight.\r\nOn\r\n  direct appeal, Clark argued the court erred in failing to suppress Lemonâ€™s\r\n  in-court identification of him.Â  This court affirmed.\r\nPOST-CONVICTION RELIEF\r\nIn his hearing on the application for PCR, Clark argues defense\r\n  counsel was ineffective at trial in failing to object to a portion of the solicitorâ€™s\r\n  closing argument that allegedly vouched for and bolstered the credibility of\r\n  the witnesses.\r\nAt trial, Lemon testified she â€œwas very hesitant to finger anyone\r\n  because [she] saw [the perpetrator] so briefly and [she] wanted to be\r\n  absolutely sure. . . .â€Â  Lemon believed if she saw the perpetrator in person\r\n  and could see a profile, she would be able to state with certainty if the\r\n  suspect was the perpetrator.Â  She requested an in-person lineup, stating she\r\n  â€œcertainly didnâ€™t want to pick someone who was not the man.â€Â  On\r\n  cross-examination, she repeated that she wanted to see the men in the photo\r\n  lineups in person as she â€œdidnâ€™t feel good about fingering anybodyâ€ and\r\n  â€œwhenever [she] was shown a lineup, [she] did not feel comfortable saying\r\n  absolutely sure that it was anyone in those pictures because [she] wanted to be\r\n  absolutely sure.â€Â  Lemon further testified:Â  â€œI remember thinking all at the\r\n  same time I certainly donâ€™t want someone innocent to be charged with this\r\n  crime.â€Â  At the bond hearing, Lemon witnessed Clark â€œfacing exactly the same\r\n  way he was in [the] apartment.â€Â  She identified Clark.Â  Shackett likewise\r\n  explained his hesitancy about identifying someone if he was not certain,\r\n  testifying:Â  â€œ[O]f course, I donâ€™t want any innocent person being accused. . .\r\n  . if Iâ€™m not a hundred percent sure, . . . I canâ€™t pick one out.â€Â   \r\n\r\n\tDuring closing\r\n  arguments, the solicitor stated:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tWebsterâ€™s\r\n  dictionary defines reliability as the ability to rely on or to depend on.Â  In\r\n  this case you had an opportunity to see the definition of the reliability from\r\n  the witness stand with two people, Cosette Lemon and Terry Shackett.Â  Those two\r\n  people told you time and time again, as did the police officers who met with\r\n  them, that from the beginning of this case to the very end they said, I donâ€™t\r\n  want to pick the wrong guy, I want to be careful, I want to make sure an\r\n  innocent man is not arrested for this charge.Â  Over and over and over.Â  They\r\n    were fearful.Â  They were careful.Â  They were dependable.Â  They were real.Â  They\r\n    were honest.Â  And, again, in this courtroom yesterday they did all of those\r\n  same things and you had an opportunity to see the definition of the reliability\r\n  from that witness stand.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Trial\r\n  counsel did not object.Â   \r\nAt\r\n  the PCR hearing, trial counsel, the PCR judge, and the assistant attorney\r\n  general all conceded that stating the two witnesses were honest was the\r\n  improper opinion of the solicitor.Â  Ultimately, however, the PCR judge found: Â â€œ[w]hile\r\n  the statement that â€˜they were honestâ€™ could be construed as vouching for the\r\n  credibility of the witnesses, such a statement also could be reasonably\r\n  construed as highlighting the good-faith effort during the identification\r\n  processâ€”an effort about which the witnesses themselves had testified.â€ Â Accordingly,\r\n  the PCR judge denied Clarkâ€™s claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe appellate court gives great deference to the post-conviction relief courtâ€™s findings of fact and\r\n  conclusions of law.Â  Dempsey v. State, 363 S.C. 365, 368-69, 610 S.E.2d\r\n  812, 814 (2005). Â On review, a\r\n  PCR judgeâ€™s findings will be upheld if there is any evidence of probative value\r\n  sufficient to support them. Â Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386\r\n  S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989).Â   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIn\r\n  order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a PCR\r\n  applicant must prove that: Â (1) counselâ€™s performance was deficient, and (2)\r\n  the deficient performance prejudiced the applicantâ€™s case.Â  Id. Â To show\r\n  that counsel was deficient, the applicant must establish that counsel failed to\r\n  render reasonably effective assistance under prevailing professional norms.Â  Id.Â  To show prejudice, the applicant must show that but for counselâ€™s errors, there\r\n  is a reasonable probability the result of the trial would have been different. Â Johnson\r\n    v. State, 325 S.C. 182, 186, 480 S.E.2d 733, 735 (1997).Â  A reasonable\r\n  probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome\r\n  of trial.Â  Id.\r\nDuring trial, a\r\n  solicitor â€œcannot vouch for the credibility of a witness by expressing or\r\n  implying his personal opinion concerning a witnessâ€™ truthfulness.â€Â  State v.\r\n    Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 630, 545 S.E.2d 805, 818 (2001).Â  Additionally, â€œ[i]t is inappropriate for the State to assure the jury\r\n  of a witnessâ€™ credibility, because the jury is charged with assessing the\r\n  credibility of witnesses based on evidence in the record.â€Â  Matthews v.\r\n    State, 350 S.C. 272, 276, 565 S.E.2d 766, 768 (2002).  \r\nWe find even if\r\n  Clarkâ€™s counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the solicitorâ€™s\r\n  comments, there is no reasonable probability the juryâ€™s verdict would have been\r\n  different and therefore there is no prejudice to Clark.Â  See Johnson,\r\n  325 S.C. at 186, 480 S.E.2d at 735 (finding no prejudice where the result of\r\n  the trial would not likely have been different).Â  Standing alone, the statement,\r\n  â€œ[t]hey were honest,â€ could be inappropriate as vouching for the credibility of\r\n  witnesses.Â  However, in this case, we agree with the PCR judgeâ€™s conclusion\r\n  that the solicitorâ€™s comments were generally based on the witnessesâ€™ testimony,\r\n  in which they described their concern about misidentifying the perpetrator.Â  The\r\n  substance of the solicitorâ€™s closing argument reminded the jury of the\r\n  diligence and hesitation with which the victims approached the identification\r\n  process. Â The solicitor was not talking about the witnessesâ€™ credibility on the\r\n  witness stand but was summarizing their testimony, which described their\r\n  conscientious manner throughout the investigation of the crime.Â  Because we\r\n  find the comment did not prejudice Clark, Clark has not met his burden of\r\n  demonstrating he was deprived of a fair trial.Â  Accordingly, the order denying Clarkâ€™s petition for PCR is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and\r\n  STILWELL, JJ., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] An identi-kit allows police to create a\r\n  composite image of a suspect based on verbal descriptions using preprogrammed\r\n  feature images.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-412","title":"Hall v.

Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Appellant appeals the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  rulings that specific testimony given by two separate witnesses was relevant.\r\n  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant and\r\n  Pamela Thurston were married, but the couple separated on April 30, 2004, when\r\n  Appellant moved out.Â  On May 2, 2004, Appellant returned to the marital home,\r\n  where Mrs. Thurston continued to reside, to retrieve some items he owned.Â \r\n  During Appellantâ€™s visit to the home, Mrs. Thurston called the police.Â \r\n  Appellant left the home by the time the responding officer arrived.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  officer spoke with Mrs. Thurston and found her to be so nervous and upset that\r\n  she was shaking.Â  Mrs. Thurston told the officer that while leaving, her\r\n  husband told her he was going to kill her and then ran over the gate she was\r\n  standing behind.Â  The officer inspected the metal gate and found it to be\r\n  twisted.Â Â  The officer also spoke with Mrs. Thurstonâ€™s neighbor who claimed to\r\n  have witnessed the events between Appellant and Mrs. Thurston.Â  The neighborâ€™s\r\n  description of the events corroborated the description given by Mrs. Thurston.\r\nBased\r\n  on these events, Appellant was indicted for assault with intent to kill.Â \r\n  Appellant was convicted by a jury of the lesser offense of assault of a high and\r\n  aggravated nature.Â  Appellant was sentenced to five years imprisonment.Â Â  \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.â€ Â State\r\n    v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001). Â â€œThe admission or exclusion of evidence is a matter\r\n  within the sound discretion of the trial court and absent clear abuse, will not\r\n  be disturbed on appeal.â€ Â Gamble v. Int'l Paper Realty Corp. of S.C.,\r\n  323 S.C. 367, 373, 474 S.E.2d 438, 441 (1996). Â â€œAn abuse of discretion\r\n  occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law.â€Â  State v.\r\n    Horton, 359 S.C. 555, 566, 598 S.E.2d 279, 285 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  To\r\n  warrant reversal, an appellant must show both error and resulting prejudice. Â Recco Tape &amp; Label\r\n    Co., Inc. v. Barfield, 312 S.C. 214, 216, 439 S.E.2d 838, 840 (1994). Â The\r\n  determination of the prejudicial effect of the evidence must be based on the\r\n  entire record and the result will generally turn on the facts of each case.Â  State\r\n    v. Gillian,&nbsp;373 S.C. 601, 609, 646 S.E.2d 872, 876&nbsp;(2007).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nâ€œRelevant\r\n  evidence means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact\r\n  that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less\r\n  probable than it would be without the evidence.â€ Rule 401, SCRE. â€œ[E]vidence is relevant if it has a direct bearing\r\n  upon and tends to establish or make more or less probable the matter in\r\n  controversy.â€ State v. Staten, 364 S.C. 7, 36-37, 610 S.E.2d 823, 838\r\n  (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nAppellant appeals the trial courtâ€™s rulings that\r\n  specific testimony given by two separate witnesses was relevant.Â Â   \r\nI.&nbsp; Mrs. Thurstonâ€™s\r\n  Testimony\r\nDuring the solicitorâ€™s direct examination of Mrs.\r\n  Thurston, she stated she first saw Appellant on the morning of the assault when\r\n  he woke her up.Â  The solicitor then asked Mrs. Thurston how the Appellant woke\r\n  her up.Â  Mrs. Thurston responded: â€œI had a bunch of things piled in front of\r\n  the door so I would be awoked [sic] because I was staying up all night because\r\n  I was scared he would come in the middle of the night.â€Â  At this point,\r\n  Appellantâ€™s trial attorney objected.Â   \r\nAppellant contends\r\n  this testimony was offered to imply Mrs. Thurston had reason to fear him.Â  In\r\n  support of this contention, Appellant points out additional testimony given by\r\n  Mrs. Thurston, which followed the response quoted above, in which she stated\r\n  the Appellant came in â€˜ragingâ€ and â€œhollering different things.â€Â  Appellant\r\n  also points out that the solicitor referred to him as a â€œbullyâ€ during his\r\n  closing arguments.Â  However, Appellantâ€™s trial attorney failed to object to the\r\n  additional testimony or the comments by the solicitor.Â  To properly preserve\r\n  an issue for review there must be a contemporaneous objection that is ruled upon by the trial court.Â  State v. Johnson, 363\r\n  S.C. 53, 58, 609 S.E.2d 520, 523 (2005).\r\n  Accordingly, this additional testimony and the solicitorâ€™s comments are not\r\n  preserved for review.  \r\nThe testimony that Appellant\r\n  objected to explained how Mrs. Thurston first encountered the Appellant on the\r\n  day of the assault.Â  Appellant had not been staying at the home since he and\r\n  Mrs. Thurston separated.Â  Mrs. Thurston was explaining how Appellant, who did\r\n  not live with her, was able to wake her up by entering her home.Â  She did not\r\n  say she was scared of Appellant but that she â€œwas scared he would come in the middle of the night.â€Â  The trial\r\n  court did not abuse its discretion in finding the evidence to be relevant.Â  The\r\n  testimony, by explaining how Appellantâ€™s entry into Mrs. Thurstonâ€™s home had\r\n  awakened her, makes it more probable that he was at her home on the day of the\r\n  assault.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nII.&nbsp; Appellantâ€™s Cross\r\n  Examination\r\nDuring his cross examination of Appellant, the\r\n  solicitor asked Appellant: â€œTwo days before that on April 30th, you had thrown\r\n  your wife around, hadnâ€™t you?â€Â  Appellant responded: â€œNo sir. We had got into\r\n  an argument and I left.â€Â  After discussing Appellantâ€™s weight and stature and\r\n  the weight of Mrs. Thurston, the solicitor states that he would like to talk\r\n  about â€œthe argument on the 30th.â€Â  At this point, Appellantâ€™s trial attorney\r\n  objected based on relevancy.Â  The trial court overruled the relevancy\r\n  objection.Â   \r\nThere\r\n  is no objection in the record to the specific questions or responses the Appellant\r\n  now points out and takes exception with.Â  The only objection to the testimony\r\n  came almost a full page in the record after Appellant first answered the\r\n  solicitorâ€™s question about the alleged argument on April 30th and\r\n  almost a full page before the solicitor asked the other questions now\r\n  specifically pointed out by Appellant.Â  It is well settled\r\n  that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been\r\n  raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved.Â  Pye v. Estate\r\n    of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 565, 633 S.E.2d 505, 510 (2006).Â \r\n  Furthermore, given that Appellant had already answered the solicitorâ€™s first\r\n  questions well before Appellantâ€™s trial attorney objected, there was no\r\n  prejudicial effect from similar questions asked and answered following the\r\n  objection.Â  Accordingly, we find no error on the part of the trial court on\r\n  this issue.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons\r\n  stated above, the order of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL,\r\n  SHORT, and WILLIAMS JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-430","title":"SCDSS v.

(Mother) and T.B. (Father) appeal from a family court order terminating\r\n  their parental rights to I.B. (Daughter).Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nDaughter is Motherâ€™s seventh child and Fatherâ€™s twelfth.[2]Â  Mother does not have custody of any\r\n  of her other children, and several of Fatherâ€™s children have been raised by\r\n  relatives.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  Department of Social Services (DSS) became involved in this case when Mother\r\n  tested positive for cocaine and marijuana during her third trimester of\r\n  pregnancy with Daughter.Â  DSS received a report about this drug use on March\r\n  14, 2005, and the case was indicated on April 28, 2005 for substantial risk of\r\n  physical abuse and neglect.Â  Daughter was born on April 23, 2005, and she was\r\n  placed into DSS custody on June 1, 2005.Â   \r\nBoth Mother and Father have long histories of drug abuse.Â  In\r\n  1995, Mother gave birth to a child who tested positive for cocaine, and in\r\n  March 2000, Mother tested positive for cocaine while she was pregnant with\r\n  another child.Â  At the termination of parental rights (TPR) hearing, DSS\r\n  presented two experts - Sam Tipton, a drug and alcohol counselor, and Dr.\r\n  Patrick Goldsmith, a psychologist.Â  Â Â \r\nTipton diagnosed Mother as having cocaine dependence and cannabis dependence.Â \r\n  Tipton testified that, although Mother did â€œreal wellâ€ in treatment initially,\r\n  she relapsed within a week after participating in a program in 2005 at The\r\n  Palmetto Center, an inpatient treatment facility.Â  Mother was tested for drugs a\r\n  few months later in early 2006, and she again tested positive for cocaine on\r\n  two occasions.Â  Mother was tested in August 2006 and when that test came back\r\n  positive, Mother was sent to The Charleston Center, another inpatient program.Â  \r\n \r\nDr. Goldsmith testified he met with Mother in July 2005 and\r\n  administered several psychological tests to her.Â  Based on these tests, he\r\n  diagnosed her with cannabis dependency, cocaine dependency, and severe mental\r\n  retardation.Â  He also found she had multiple stressors associated with\r\n  addiction and mental retardation.Â  Motherâ€™s overall IQ was below 35, which is\r\n  in the severe range of mental retardation.Â  Dr. Goldsmith opined that â€œshe will\r\n  need assistance most of her life, and that generally is not reversible.Â  She\r\n  might have some mental improvement if she would stop using drugs; but, I doubt\r\n  . . . her sincerity in regard to that.â€Â  Dr. Goldsmith described Motherâ€™s\r\n  addiction as being â€œas severe as anything [heâ€™d] ever seenâ€ and explained that\r\n  â€œher failed drug screens while pregnant and after removal are indicative of\r\n  severity.â€Â   \r\nDr. Goldsmith also met with Father during\r\n  July 2005.Â  He diagnosed Father with schizophrenia, dementia due to alcoholism,\r\n  and as having severe stressors due to his complicated psychiatric problems and\r\n  marital difficulties.Â  Dr. Goldsmith noted Fatherâ€™s addiction to alcohol was in\r\n  remission, but that he suffered permanent damage from his previous alcohol\r\n  abuse.Â  He stated Father reads at a second-grade level and cannot remember\r\n  three items after five minutes.Â  Dr. Goldsmith also noted Father was on disability\r\n  and had a guardian appointed to handle his disability fund.Â  Â Â \r\nMelissa Robinson, the foster care worker for Daughter, also\r\n  testified at the TPR hearing.Â  Robinson acknowledged that both Mother and Father\r\n  consistently visited Daughter and brought her clothes or other items when they\r\n  came to visit.Â  Robinson stated that, although DSS currently had no prospective\r\n  adoptive parents for Daughter, she was â€œdoing greatâ€ in her foster home.Â \r\n  Robinson testified Mother did not complete her treatment plan, but Father had essentially\r\n  done everything DSS had asked of him.Â  Despite Fatherâ€™s compliance with the\r\n  treatment plan, however, Robinson did not believe Father was able to care for\r\n  Daughter by himself, nor did she know of any relatives who could help care for\r\n  the child.Â  Robinson noted that DSS performed a home study on one of Fatherâ€™s\r\n  sisters, but DSS declined to place Daughter with the sister because she had\r\n  been convicted of criminal domestic violence.Â   \r\nThe guardian ad litem filed a report with the family court\r\n  recommending the termination of both Motherâ€™s and Fatherâ€™s parental rights.Â  In\r\n  the report, the guardian noted she would rather see Daughter placed with a\r\n  relative who knew the childâ€™s limitations, but the only relative who wanted the\r\n  child was not acceptable to DSS because of her prior conviction.Â  At the TPR\r\n  hearing, the guardian expressed her reluctance to terminate Fatherâ€™s parental\r\n  rights, but ultimately stood by the recommendation in her report.Â   \r\nThe family court found Mother had a diagnosable condition that was\r\n  unlikely to change within a reasonable time; she failed to remedy conditions\r\n  leading to Daughterâ€™s removal; and, due to the severity and repetition of\r\n  Motherâ€™s abuse and neglect, it was unlikely her home could be made safe within\r\n  the next twelve months.Â  With regard to Father, the family court found he had a\r\n  diagnosable condition that was unlikely to change within a reasonable time and\r\n  that, because of the diagnosable condition, he had failed to remedy conditions\r\n  leading to Daughterâ€™s removal.Â  The family court further found termination of\r\n  Motherâ€™s and Fatherâ€™s parental rights was in Daughterâ€™s best interest.Â  Mother\r\n  and Father have filed separate appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nIn a TPR action, the best interest of the child is the paramount consideration.Â  Doe\r\n    v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 578 S.E.2d 733 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Before\r\n  parental rights may be irrevocably terminated, the State must prove the alleged\r\n  grounds for termination by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Richberg v.\r\n    Dawson, 278 S.C. 356, 296 S.E.2d 338 (1982); South Carolina Depâ€™t\r\n      of Soc. Servs. V. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 519 S.E.2d 351 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\n \r\nOn appeal in a TPR action, an appellate court has the authority to\r\n  review the entire record to make its own factual findings and to determine whether\r\n  the grounds for termination are supported by clear and convincing evidence.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 547 S.E.2d 506\r\n  (Ct. App. 2001).Â  This broad scope of review, however, does not require the\r\n  appellate court to disregard the findings of the family court, which was in a\r\n  better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and to assign comparative\r\n  weight to their testimony.Â  Hardy v. Gunter, 353 S.C. 128, 577 S.E.2d\r\n  231 (Ct. App. 2003).Â   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Expert\r\n  Testimony\r\nMother initially argues the family court erred in qualifying Sam\r\n  Tipton as an expert witness and in attaching any weight to his testimony.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nâ€œTo qualify as an expert, a person must have acquired by study or\r\n  practical experience a special knowledge of a subject matter about which the\r\n  [fact-finderâ€™s] good judgment and average knowledge is inadequate.â€Â  Manning\r\n    v. City of Columbia, 297 S.C. 451, 453-54, 377 S.E.2d 335, 337 (1989).Â  The\r\n  qualification of expert witnesses and the admissibility of their opinions are\r\n  matters resting within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Id. at 453, 377 S.E.2d at 336-37.Â  On appeal, we will not disturb the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  ruling in the absence of an abuse of that discretion and a showing of\r\n  prejudice.Â  Strange v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Hwys. &amp; Pub. Transp.,\r\n  307 S.C. 161, 414 S.E.2d 138 (1992).\r\nBefore being qualified as an expert in addiction counseling,\r\n  Tipton testified that he had been employed as a drug and alcohol abuse\r\n  counselor for approximately seven years.Â  To become a counselor, Tipton had to\r\n  complete four years of college and receive certification from the State.Â \r\n  Although Tipton does not regularly testify in court, he was qualified as an\r\n  expert in another court proceeding several years prior to the TPR hearing in\r\n  this case.Â  Based on Tiptonâ€™s experience, education, and training, we find the\r\n  family court did not abuse its discretion in qualifying Tipton as an expert in\r\n  addiction counseling.\r\nII. Grounds\r\n  for Termination\r\nNext, both Mother and Father appeal from the family courtâ€™s\r\n  finding that grounds exist to terminate their parental rights.Â  Addressing\r\n  Motherâ€™s arguments first, she contends the record does not contain clear and\r\n  convincing evidence that she has a diagnosable condition that is unlikely to\r\n  change within a reasonable time.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 20-7-1572(6) of the South Carolina Code provides in\r\n  relevant part as follows:\r\n\r\n\tIt is presumed that the parentâ€™s condition is unlikely to change\r\n  within a reasonable time upon proof that the parent has been required by the\r\n  department or the family court to participate in a treatment program for\r\n  alcohol or drug addiction, and the parent has failed two or more times to\r\n  complete the program successfully or has refused at two or more separate\r\n  meetings with the department to participate in a treatment program[.]\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-7-1572(6) (Supp. 2006).\r\nHere,\r\n  Mother received inpatient treatment at The Palmetto Center, and she relapsed within\r\n  a week of being released to after-care services.Â  Mother continued to test\r\n  positive for cocaine until August 18, 2006, two months prior to the TPR\r\n  hearing.Â  DSS again referred Mother for inpatient treatment, which was supposed\r\n  to last for three months, but Mother was discharged with a month.[3]Â  On October 6, 2006, just days before\r\n  the TPR hearing, Mother missed her scheduled appointment at another drug\r\n  rehabilitation center.Â   \r\nIn addition to the failed treatments during the pendency of this\r\n  action, Mother has a long history of abusing drugs and being unable to overcome\r\n  her addiction, even while pregnant or facing the termination of her parental\r\n  rights.Â  DSS presented evidence that Mother used cocaine during two previous pregnancies.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find no error in the family courtâ€™s determination that Mother\r\n  has a diagnosable condition that is unlikely to change within a reasonable\r\n  time.[4]\r\nLikewise, Father contends the family court erred in finding he had\r\n  a diagnosable condition unlikely to change within a reasonable time.Â  Specifically,\r\n  he argues he has the mental capacity and ability to provide minimally\r\n  acceptable care for Daughter.Â  We disagree.\r\nAccording to testimony presented at the TPR hearing, Father has a\r\n  full- scale IQ of 50.Â  Dr. Goldsmith testified Father reads at a second-grade\r\n  level and could not remember a list of three items after five minutes.Â  In\r\n  addition to these problems, Father has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and\r\n  dementia due to alcoholism.Â   \r\nFather is to be commended for complying with his treatment plan;\r\n  however, his intellectual functioning is unfortunately so impaired that neither\r\n  Dr. Goldsmith nor Melissa Robinson, the foster care worker, believed Father\r\n  could parent Daughter.Â  Although the guardian initially expressed feeling\r\n  â€œconflictedâ€ about recommending the termination of Fatherâ€™s parental rights,\r\n  the family court, which actually saw and heard Father testify at the hearing,\r\n  found the evidence â€œoverwhelmingly clear and convincingâ€ and stated it had â€œno\r\n  doubt . . . that neither of [Daughterâ€™s] two biological parents . . . are fit\r\n  and proper individuals to have custody of [Daughter].â€Â  See Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 477 S.E.2d\r\n  476 (Ct. App. 1996) (explaining that despite the appellate courtâ€™s broad scope\r\n  of review, it should remain cognizant that the family court had the advantage\r\n  of seeing and hearing the witnesses before making findings of fact).Â  We find\r\n  clear and convincing evidence was presented to prove Father suffers from a\r\n  diagnosable condition that is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.\r\nII. Best\r\n  Interest\r\nFinally,\r\n  Mother and Father argue terminating their parental rights would not serve\r\n  Daughterâ€™s best interest.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt the\r\n  time of the TPR hearing, Daughter was eighteen months old, and she had been in\r\n  foster care for all but one month of her life.Â  Although Mother and Father\r\n  visited frequently, the guardian testified that any harm to Daughter if her\r\n  biological parentsâ€™ rights were terminated would be â€œshort-termâ€ as children â€œrebound\r\n  very quickly.â€Â  Furthermore, there was evidence Daughter was doing well in\r\n  foster care, and at least one potential adoptive family became disinterested\r\n  upon learning Daughter was not yet free for adoption.Â  Considering Daughterâ€™s\r\n  young age and the improbability that either Mother or Father would ever be able\r\n  to care for her, we agree a long-term plan of adoption is in Daughterâ€™s best\r\n  interest.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the order of the family court terminating Motherâ€™s and\r\n  Fatherâ€™s parental rights is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  At the time of the hearing in this matter, Mother\r\n  was pregnant again.Â   \r\n[3]Â  It is unclear from the record why Mother was\r\n  discharged, but Mother offered no proof that she had successfully completed the\r\n  program.\r\n[4] Â Having found this statutory ground established by\r\n  clear and convincing evidence, we need not address the remaining grounds relied\r\n  upon by the family court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-431","title":"SCDSS v.

White, of Moncks Corner, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Mother\r\n  appeals the termination of her parental rights (TPR) to her two minor children.Â \r\n  Â Â We affirm.[1]Â   \r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn November 24, 1999, the two minor children were placed in\r\n  protective custody based on allegations that Mother posed a threat of harm to\r\n  the minor children.Â  Father A, Motherâ€™s husband and the father of one of the\r\n  minor children, had been accused of sexually molesting two other children.Â  After\r\n  a hearing on November 29, 1999, the family court found the Department of Social\r\n  Services (DSS) had probable cause to assume protective custody of the children;\r\n  however, the court returned legal and physical custody to Mother because Father\r\n  A had removed himself from the home.Â   \r\nThe merits hearing was rescheduled three times and finally heard\r\n  on June 1, 2001.Â  At the hearing, the family court found Mother posed a risk of\r\n  harm to the minor children, but allowed her to retain custody subject to a\r\n  restraining order that Father A not be left alone with the children.Â  Both\r\n  Mother and Father A were ordered to attend individual and family counseling.Â  \r\n \r\nDSS commenced another removal case on August 16, 2001, alleging that,\r\n  on August 11, 2001, Father A attempted to sexually abuse a visiting niece when\r\n  he was left alone with the children in violation of the restraining order.Â  The\r\n  family court issued an order placing the minor children in protective custody.Â \r\n  The merits hearing on the second removal action was scheduled for September 17,\r\n  2001, but was continued because insufficient time had been scheduled for a\r\n  contested hearing.Â  The hearing was continued again on February 27, 2002, for\r\n  the same reason.Â  On April 4, 2002, the family court ordered the case to be\r\n  immediately set for a two-day trial.Â  When no hearing was scheduled, Mother\r\n  filed a motion to dismiss.Â  A hearing on that motion was not scheduled, and\r\n  Mother filed a second motion, requesting an expedited hearing on her motion to dismiss.Â \r\n  A hearing on Motherâ€™s motion was held on April 24, 2003.Â  By order dated May\r\n  21, 2003, and filed May 28, 2003, the family court noted new counsel had been\r\n  appointed to represent Mother and ordered the cases to be heard within thirty\r\n  days or the minor children returned to Mother without a further hearing.Â  Â Â \r\nWhile the matter was under advisement, however, a merits hearing\r\n  on the second removal action was held on May 19 and 20, 2003.Â  The family court\r\n  found DSS failed to prove Mother left the children unattended with Father A on\r\n  August, 11, 2001, but did find that Mother had left the children alone with Father\r\n  A at some unspecified time.Â  By order dated June 23, 2003, and filed June 25,\r\n  2003, the family court granted DSS physical and legal custody of the children\r\n  based on a threat of harm. Â Attached to the order was a treatment plan\r\n  acknowledging Mother had completed parenting classes and requiring her to complete\r\n  a mental health assessment, follow the recommendations of the therapist,\r\n  participate in family therapy with the children, support the children, and\r\n  provide a safe home for the children. \r\nA permanency planning hearing was held on June 5, 2003.Â  By order\r\n  filed July 25, 2003, the family court found, in relevant part, a hearing to\r\n  determine whether the children should be returned to Mother must be held within\r\n  six months.Â  A supplemental order, which was referred to as a treatment plan,\r\n  was attached.Â  This treatment plan acknowledged (1) Mother had completed\r\n  parenting classes; (2) Mother had participated in family therapy until August\r\n  13, 2002, when there was a â€œcrisisâ€ involving the police that resulted in the\r\n  cessation of her participation in family therapy; and (3) Motherâ€™s visitation\r\n  rights had been temporarily suspended in April 2003.Â  This treatment plan also\r\n  required Mother to obtain a mental health assessment, follow the recommendations\r\n  of the therapist performing the assessment, and support the children.Â  Finally,\r\n  under the treatment plan, Mother was to have supervised visitation with the\r\n  children.Â  The plan also called for Mother to attend family therapy with one of\r\n  the children so that the two could address certain issues concerning that child\r\n  and complete â€œclarification.â€Â  \r\nMother filed a motion to alter or amend the permanency planning order\r\n  on August 13, 2003.Â  By order filed November 26, 2003, the family court amended\r\n  the order and required counsel for DSS to â€œsubmit an agreement to this Court\r\n  which states only those items that Defendants are required to do in terms of\r\n  the treatment/placement plans.â€Â  DSS did not submit an agreed-upon treatment\r\n  plan, however, and no hearing was scheduled within six months as the family\r\n  court directed in its July 25, 2003 order.Â  Furthermore, Mother argues on\r\n  appeal she was not granted supervised visitation in a timely manner.\r\nA second permanency planning hearing was scheduled for July 26,\r\n  2004.Â  This hearing was rescheduled twice because insufficient time was\r\n  allotted for a contested hearing.Â  On December 12, 2005, the third time the\r\n  hearing was scheduled, the family court continued the case yet again to January\r\n  23, 2006, this time pursuant to a motion by the guardian ad litem on the ground that Father B, the biological father of one of the minor\r\n  children, had not been served.Â  In the order of continuance, the family court\r\n  also noted DSS had not followed the statutory guidelines for moving the case\r\n  forward in a timely fashion, substantially affecting Motherâ€™s constitutional\r\n  rights and stated the children would be returned to Mother if DSS failed to\r\n  effect service â€œabsent good causeâ€ in time for the hearing to proceed on\r\n  January 23, 2006.[2]Â   \r\nThe second permanency planning hearing was held on January 23-24,\r\n  2006.Â  By order filed on April 5, 2006, the family court terminated Motherâ€™s\r\n  parental rights.Â  On April 24, 2006, Mother filed a motion to alter or amend\r\n  the judgment or, in the alternative, for a new trial or relief from the judgment.Â \r\n  By order filed on July 26, 2006, the family court denied the requested relief.Â \r\n  This appeal followed.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSection\r\n  20-7-1578 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006), mandates that the TPR\r\n  statutes â€œmust be liberally construed in order to ensure prompt judicial\r\n  procedures for freeing minor children from the custody and control of their\r\n  parents by terminating the parent-child relationship.â€Â  See also Joiner\r\n    v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 109, 536 S.E.2d 372, 375 (2000) (overruling prior\r\n  cases calling for strict construction of the TPR statutes).Â   \r\nGrounds\r\n  for TPR must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc.\r\n    Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 608-09, 582 S.E.2d 419, 423 (2003) (citing Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745 (1982)).Â  Furthermore, â€œ[u]pon review,\r\n  the appellate court may make its own finding from the record as to whether\r\n  clear and convincing evidence supports the termination.â€Â  Id. at 609,\r\n  582 S.E.2d at 423.Â  The reviewing court, however, is not required â€œto ignore\r\n  the fact that the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a\r\n  better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to\r\n  their testimony.â€Â  Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 297, 513 S.E.2d\r\n  358, 367 (1999).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Mother contends the\r\n  family court erred in failing to return the children when DSS failed to comply\r\n  with the terms of the December 12, 2005 order issued by the family court.Â  We find\r\n  no error. Â \r\nIn its final order,\r\n  the family court found DSS was â€œin substantial compliance with said order as it\r\n  was verbally issued from the bench.â€Â  We agree.Â  The December 12, 2005 order\r\n  mandated return of the children to Mother only if DSS failed to effect timely\r\n  service â€œabsent good cause.â€Â  Father B, the particular defendant for whom service\r\n  was at issue, had already voluntarily relinquished his parental rights.Â \r\n  According to counsel for DSS, he was served December 29, 2005.Â  There is no\r\n  evidence that the failure to DSS to effect service in time for the hearing to\r\n  proceed was without good cause.Â  Moreover, the hearing proceeded as scheduled\r\n  and the family court issued a final order in the matter.Â  Accordingly, although\r\n  DSS did not strictly comply with the order of December 12, 2005, we affirm the\r\n  family courtâ€™s refusal to return the children to Mother on this ground.\r\n2.Â  On appeal, Mother\r\n  challenges each of the grounds cited by the family court to support its\r\n  decision to terminate her parental rights.[3]Â \r\n  Because we affirm the family courtâ€™s determinations regarding Motherâ€™s failure\r\n  to provide material support to the children while they were foster care, we\r\n  hold DSS established at least one basis for termination of her parental\r\n  rights.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2006) (â€œThe family court\r\n  may order the termination of parental rights upon a finding of one or more\r\n    of the following grounds . . . .â€) (emphasis added).\r\nOne statutory ground\r\n  for termination of parental rights is a finding by the family court that â€œ[t]he\r\n  child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period of six months,\r\n  and during that time the parent has willfully failed to support the child.â€Â  Id. Â§ 20-7-1572(4).Â  â€œFailure to support means that the parent has failed to make a\r\n  material contribution to the childâ€™s care.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œA material\r\n  contribution consists of either financial contributions according to the\r\n  parentâ€™s means or contributions of food, clothing, shelter, or other\r\n  necessities according to the parentâ€™s means.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œJust as it does in determining wilful failure to visit, the family\r\n  court has wide discretion in determining whether a failure to support is\r\n  wilful.â€Â  Headden, 354 S.C. at 612, 582 S.E.2d at 425.Â  Moreover, the\r\n  family court may â€œlook beyond the months immediately preceding the TPR actionâ€\r\n  at a parentâ€™s â€œoverall conduct.â€Â  Id. (emphasis in original).\r\nMother paid $304.00\r\n  in five payments over the fifty-three months the children were in foster care;\r\n  however, she paid no money at all during 2002 or 2003.Â  Although a caseworker\r\n  acknowledged Mother at times brought the children lunch and gave them clothing\r\n  and undergarments, the tenor of the case workerâ€™s testimony was that these\r\n  in-kind contributions did not evidence any appreciable effort on Motherâ€™s part\r\n  to provide for her children.Â   \r\nOn appeal, Mother\r\n  cites evidence that her caseworkers were aware she was unemployed.Â  We find it significant,\r\n  however, that, the treatment plan called for Mother to support the children and\r\n  Mother herself moved to have her court-ordered child support set at $40.00 per\r\n  month.Â  Furthermore, although Mother claimed she had made good-faith efforts to\r\n  find work but had not received offers of employment because of criminal changes\r\n  pending against her and Father A, she never submitted concrete, specific\r\n  evidence regarding her endeavors.Â  We therefore hold the record supports the\r\n  family courtâ€™s finding that Mother did not provide material support to the\r\n  children according to her means while they were in the custody of DSS.  \r\n3.Â  Mother further contends the\r\n  termination of her parental rights was improper because the family court erred\r\n  in finding the termination was in the best interests of the children.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n \r\nThe paramount\r\n  consideration in any case involving a termination of parental rights is the\r\n  best interests of the children.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Vanderhorst,\r\n  287 S.C. 554, 561, 340 S.E.2d 149, 153 (1986).Â  â€œThe interests of the child\r\n  shall prevail if the childâ€™s interest and the parental rights conflict.â€Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578 (Supp. 2006).\r\nOne\r\n  of the caseworkers testified that, notwithstanding the disruption in the\r\n  childrenâ€™s lives from the litigation and their entry into the foster care\r\n  system, their lives have become more stable during the time they have been in\r\n  the custody of DSS.Â  The caseworker further expressed concern that Mother had\r\n  not indicated any willingness to understand the risk the children would face if\r\n  Father A had access to them.Â  The guardian ad litem expressed a\r\n  similar concern as well as her opinion that visits between Mother and the\r\n  children led to mixed feelings and confusion for the children.Â  In view of this\r\n  testimony, we hold the family court correctly determined that termination of Motherâ€™s\r\n  parental rights was in the childrenâ€™s best interest.\r\n4.Â  Although\r\n  we have affirmed the termination of parental rights in this case, we commend the\r\n  numerous attorneys who represented Mother, most if not all of whom were\r\n  court-appointed counsel, for their zealous and thorough advocacy on their\r\n  clientâ€™s behalf during this prolonged and emotionally difficult litigation.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON,\r\n  KITTREDGE, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] For unknown reasons, this order was not filed until\r\n  January 23, 2006, the same day as the hearing.Â   \r\n[3]Â  The family court based its decision to terminate\r\n  Motherâ€™s parental rights on (1) Motherâ€™s failure to provide material support to\r\n  the children while they were in the custody of DSS; (2) the length of time the\r\n  children had been in foster care; and (3) Motherâ€™s failure to remedy the\r\n  condition causing the removal of the children or to otherwise rehabilitate\r\n  herself and the uncertainty that Mother could provide a safe home for the\r\n  children within twelve months.Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-432","title":"State v.

Nelson, Jr., both of Greenville, for Appellants.\r\n\t\t\t\tBrian Patrick Murphy, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Chapman\r\n  Mirror and Glass and RSRJ, LLC (collectively Appellants), appeal the jury\r\n  verdict in favor of Zachary Harvey (Harvey) claiming: (1) the trial court erred\r\n  in not granting Appellantsâ€™ judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) motion;\r\n  (2) the trial court failed to adequately charge the jury on the requirements\r\n  necessary to modify a written contract; and (3) the evidence at trial was\r\n  legally insufficient to sustain an award of punitive damages.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant RSRJ,\r\n  LLC, a North Carolina company, operates Chapman Mirror and Glass (Chapman).Â \r\n  Randall Simmons and Roland Johnson formed RSRJ for the purpose of purchasing\r\n  Chapman.Â  Chapman supplies and installs â€œafter paintâ€ products, which include\r\n  shower doors, mirrors, closet shelving, and bath and door hardware.Â   \r\nIn April 2003,\r\n  Chapman hired Harvey as a sales representative at its Greenville, South Carolina branch.Â  Harvey was assigned a sales territory and made sales calls to\r\n  Chapman customers.Â  During the interview process, Harvey was given a copy of\r\n  Chapmanâ€™s Sales Employment Agreement (the Agreement).Â  The Agreement governed\r\n  the terms of Harveyâ€™s employment and included a covenant not to compete.Â  Harvey signed the Agreement on April 10, 2003.Â \r\n \r\nIn late 2004,\r\n  Roland Johnson divorced his wife, Annette Johnson.Â  In the divorce settlement,\r\n  Mrs. Johnson acquired her husbandâ€™s membership interest in RSRJ.Â  Mrs. Johnson\r\n  and Simmons did not agree on the management of the business and began\r\n  negotiating a buy out by one of the parties.Â  Mrs. Johnson and her accountant\r\n  visited the Greenville branch as part of her review of the business and its\r\n  assets. Â Prior to the visit, the office manager, Marty Street, told the\r\n  employees at the Greenville branch that he worried Mrs. Johnson planned to take\r\n  a more active role in the business, and he did not want to work for a woman.Â \r\n  Street shredded the Agreements in his possession before Mrs. Johnsonâ€™s visit to\r\n  Greenville and informed Harvey he had done so.Â  Ultimately, Simmons bought out\r\n  Mrs. Johnsonâ€™s interest in the business.Â   \r\nIn April 2005, Gale\r\n  Contractor Services (Gale), a competitor of Chapman, recruited Harvey.Â  Based on prior conversations, Harvey testified he was under the impression he was\r\n  no longer constrained by the Agreement and the covenant not to compete.Â  As\r\n  such, Harvey accepted the employment offer with Gale.Â  Harvey informed Street\r\n  he was resigning and was accepting a sales position with Gale.Â  Street and\r\n  Simmons unsuccessfully tried to convince Harvey to stay at Chapman.Â  Harvey worked the final two weeks of April without incident.Â \r\n \r\nHarvey contends,\r\n  once he gave his two week notice, Street and Simmons never indicated to him\r\n  that his working for Gale was a breach of any existing contractual agreement.Â \r\n  He further recalled an instance in which Simmons brought up the torn Agreements\r\n  and represented to Harvey he would not pursue the matter.Â  Appellants contend Harvey tried to convince Street he would not be competing with Chapman and he would be in a\r\n  management training program at Gale.Â  Further, Simmons claims he told Harvey if he pursued Chapmanâ€™s customers, Chapman would enforce the covenant not to\r\n  compete.Â   \r\nHarvey began\r\n  working at Gale on May 2, 2005.Â  On May 10, 2005, Chapmanâ€™s attorney sent a\r\n  letter to Steven Click, Galeâ€™s general manager, asserting Harvey was bound to a\r\n  non-compete agreement with Chapman, and Chapman would commence a lawsuit if\r\n  Harveyâ€™s employment was not immediately terminated.Â  A similar letter was sent\r\n  directly to Harvey.Â  As a result of the letter, Click terminated Harvey on May 18, 2005.\r\nOn May 24, 2005, Harvey filed a complaint\r\n  and an amended complaint on May 2, 2006, alleging, inter alia, Chapmanâ€™s\r\n  intentional interference with a contract, negligent misrepresentation,\r\n  constructive fraud, promissory estoppel, and breach of contract.Â  A jury trial\r\n  was held on June 5, 6, and 7, 2006.Â  The trial judge submitted to the jury the\r\n  claims for (1) intentional interference with contract, (2) negligent\r\n  misrepresentation, and (3) constructive fraud.Â  The parties consented to a\r\n  general verdict form.Â  The jury returned a verdict in favor of Harvey in the total amount of $175,000, consisting of $75,000 in actual damages and\r\n  $100,000 in punitive damages.Â  Appellants moved for JNOV, which the trial judge\r\n  denied.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; JNOV\r\nAppellants claim the trial court erred in not granting\r\n  their JNOV motion because Harvey presented no evidence of any consideration or\r\n  meeting of the minds to support a modification of the contract.Â  Harvey avers the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule applies, such that this Court need not address the issues\r\n  raised involving modification.Â  We agree with Harvey.  \r\nPursuant\r\n  to the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule, when a jury returns a general verdict involving two or\r\n  more issues, and its verdict is supported by at least one issue, the appellate\r\n  court will affirm unless the appellant appeals all causes of action.Â  Anderson v. S.C. Dept. of Highways and Pub. Transp., 322 S.C. 417, 419-20,\r\n  472 S.E.2d 253, 254 (1996).Â   \r\nBy\r\n  agreement, this case was submitted for a general verdict on three claims: (1)\r\n  intentional interference with a contract; (2) negligent misrepresentation; and\r\n  (3) constructive fraud.Â  The trial court charged the jury on all three claims.Â \r\n  Harvey contends Appellantsâ€™ arguments on appeal regarding modification relate\r\n  solely to the intentional interference with a contract claim, and therefore,\r\n  they have not appealed the negligent misrepresentation or constructive fraud\r\n  claims.Â  Further, Harvey claims the two\r\n  non-appealed claims support the jury verdict.Â  Conversely, Appellants contend\r\n  the alleged lack of modification relates to all three claims, and therefore,\r\n  the judgment must be reversed.Â   \r\nWe\r\n  find the issue of modification, raised by Appellants, relates to the\r\n  intentional interference with a contract claim.Â  Specifically, modification\r\n  relates to the fourth element of the claim, the absence of justification.Â  To\r\n  establish intentional interference with a contract one must show (1) the\r\n  existence of the contract; (2) the other partyâ€™s knowledge of its existence;\r\n  (3) the other partyâ€™s intentional procurement of the breach of the contract;\r\n  (4) the absence of justification; and (5) resulting damage.Â  Webb v. Elrod,\r\n  308 S.C. 445, 447, 418 S.E.2d 559, 561 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  Appellants claim there\r\n  was no modification of the Agreement, and thus, the covenant not to compete was\r\n  still in force when Harvey left Chapman.Â  According to Appellants, Simmons\r\n  acted within his contractual rights when he enforced the terms of the covenant\r\n  not to compete.Â  We agree Appellantsâ€™ argument on modification applies to the\r\n  intentional interference claim, such that a lack of modification may serve as\r\n  justification for Simmonsâ€™ actions.\r\nHowever,\r\n  we fail to see how Appellantsâ€™ modification argument relates to either the\r\n  negligent misrepresentation or constructive fraud claims.Â  In a negligent\r\n  misrepresentation action, a plaintiff must prove the following: (1) the\r\n  defendant made a false representation to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant had a\r\n  pecuniary interest in making the statement; (3) the defendant owed a duty of\r\n  care to see that he communicated truthful information to the plaintiff; (4) the\r\n  defendant breached that duty by failing to exercise due care; (5) the plaintiff\r\n  justifiably relied on the representation; and (6) the plaintiff suffered a\r\n  pecuniary loss as a proximate result of his reliance on the representation.Â  Armstrong\r\n    v. Collins, 366 S.C. 204, 219-20, 621 S.E.2d 368, 375 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\n \r\nTo\r\n  establish constructive fraud, all elements of actual fraud except the element\r\n  of intent must be established.Â  Pitts v. Jackson Natâ€™l Life Ins. Co.,\r\n  352 S.C. 319, 333, 574 S.E.2d 502, 509 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  To sustain a claim of\r\n  actual fraud, the following elements must be proven: (1) a representation; (2)\r\n  its falsity; (3) its materiality; (4) either knowledge of its falsity or\r\n  reckless disregard of its truth or falsity; (5) intent that the representation\r\n  be acted upon; (6) the hearerâ€™s ignorance of its falsity; (7) the hearerâ€™s\r\n  reliance on its truth; (8) the hearerâ€™s right to rely thereon; and (9) the\r\n  hearerâ€™s consequent and proximate injury.Â  Armstrong, 366 S.C. at 218,\r\n  621 S.E.2d at 375.Â   \r\nAppellants\r\n  argue modification relates to these two claims because if Simmons acted within\r\n  his contractual rights, then he made no misrepresentation and could not have\r\n  committed fraud.Â  Regardless of whether Simmons was acting within his\r\n  contractual rights, Harvey presented evidence of misrepresentations made by\r\n  Simmons and Street.Â  After Harvey informed Simmons and Street he was resigning\r\n  and going to work for a competitor, Simmons and Street represented that Chapman\r\n  would not pursue the matter.Â  If, as Appellants claim, Simmons had a contractual\r\n  right to enforce the covenant not to compete, the jury could conclude that a\r\n  representation to Harvey that Chapman would not pursue the matter is a\r\n  misrepresentation.  \r\nWe\r\n  find the jury returned a general verdict involving three causes of action, and\r\n  Appellants have only appealed one cause.Â  Further, we find the verdict is supported\r\n  by the constructive fraud claim.Â  Harvey presented evidence of the following:\r\n  (1) a representation by Simmons that Chapman would not pursue the covenant not\r\n  to compete; (2) Simmons knew his representation was false; (3) Simmons\r\n  representation was material; (4) Simmons knew the falsity of his representation\r\n  as evident from his actions to enforce the covenant not to compete less than\r\n  ten days after Harvey left Chapman; (5) Harvey was ignorant of the falsity of\r\n  the representation; (6) Harvey relied on the truth of the representation as\r\n  evident from Harveyâ€™s resigning at Chapman and joining Gale; (7) Harvey had a\r\n  right to rely on Simmonâ€™s representation; and (8) Harvey suffered injury as a\r\n  result of the false representation, namely his employment with Gale was\r\n  terminated.Â   \r\nBecause\r\n  the verdict is supported by at least one unappealed claim, the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule\r\n  applies, and thus, we affirm the jury verdict.Â   \r\nII.&nbsp; Jury Charge \r\nAppellants\r\n  also claim the trial court\r\n  failed to adequately charge the jury on the requirements necessary to modify a\r\n  written contract and were thereby prejudiced by the deficiencies in the charge.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nâ€œWhen reviewing a jury charge for alleged error, an appellate\r\n  court must consider the charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues\r\n  presented at trial.Â  If the charge is reasonably free from error, isolated\r\n  portions which might be misleading do not constitute reversible error.â€Â  Welch\r\n    v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 311, 536 S.E.2d 408, 425 (Ct. App. 2000) (citing Keaton\r\n      ex. rel. Foster v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 334 S.C. 488, 497-98, 514 S.E.2d\r\n  570, 575 (1999)).  \r\nWe find the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule also applies to Appellantsâ€™ claim of\r\n  an erroneous jury charge.Â  In Bryant v. Waste Mgmt., Inc., this Court\r\n  applied the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule in a similar circumstance.Â  342 S.C. 159, 536\r\n  S.E.2d 380 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  In that case, Bryant asserted six theories of\r\n  negligence, and the jury returned a general verdict in his favor. Â Id. at 167-68, 536 S.E.2d at 384-85. Â On appeal, Waste Management claimed, â€œ[T]he\r\n  trial court erred in instructing the jury that a violation of federal\r\n  Occupational Safety Health Administrations . . . regulations constitutes\r\n  negligence per se.â€Â  Id. at 166, 536 S.E.2d at 384.Â  This Court agreed\r\n  but affirmed the verdict, relying on the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule, noting:  \r\n\r\n\tWaste Management, however, has not shown it was prejudiced by [the\r\n  erroneous jury instruction] because there existed other bases upon which the\r\n  jury could find it liable. . . . Because the jury rendered a general verdict\r\n  and could have relied upon any of these [other] allegations of negligence to\r\n  find Waste Management liable and because there is ample evidence supporting at\r\n  least one of these [other] allegations . . . we cannot say Waste Management was\r\n  prejudiced by the jury charge in issue. \r\n\r\nId. at\r\n  167-68, 536 S.E.2d at 384-85.  \r\nAs\r\n  previously discussed, this case was submitted to the jury on three claims.Â \r\n  Because we find the issue of modification relates only to the intentional\r\n  interference with contract claim and at least one of the two unappealed claims\r\n  supported the verdict, whether the trial judge erred in his instruction on\r\n  modification is inconsequential.Â  See Piedmont Aviation, Inc. v.\r\n    Quinn, 294 S.C. 502, 505, 366 S.E.2d 31, 32-33 (Ct. App. 1988) (holding\r\n  when a case is submitted to a jury on two causes of action and the jury returns\r\n  a general verdict, an error by the trial court in its instructions on one\r\n  theory of recovery is of no consequence when the verdict is supported by the\r\n  second theory).\r\nIII.&nbsp; Damages \r\nLast,\r\n  Appellants argue the trial court erred in not granting Chapmanâ€™s JNOV motion on\r\n  the issue of punitive damages because the trial court could not have reasonably\r\n  found the requisite wantonness and recklessness required for an award of\r\n  punitive damages.Â  Appellants claim because Simmons acted only through his\r\n  attorney and at the advice of counsel, he cannot be found to have acted\r\n  wantonly or recklessly.Â  We disagree.  \r\nâ€œThe\r\n  issue of punitive damages must be submitted to the jury if more than one\r\n  reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence as to whether the\r\n  defendantâ€™s behavior was reckless, willful, or wanton.â€Â  Welch, 342 S.C.\r\n  at 301, 536 S.E.2d at 419 (citation omitted).Â  â€œOn appeal from a denial of a\r\n  motion for directed verdict or JNOV [relative to punitive damages], the\r\n  appellate court may only reverse if there is no evidence to support the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s ruling.â€Â  Mishoe v. QHG of Lake City, Inc., 366 S.C. 195,\r\n  200-01, 621 S.E.2d 363, 366 (Ct. App. 2005) (citation omitted).Â   \r\nAs an\r\n  affirmative defense, Appellants raise the argument that they should not be held\r\n  accountable because they acted only through their attorney and relied on the\r\n  advice of counsel.Â  South Carolina has recognized that acting in good faith\r\n  under the advice of counsel is a defense to punitive damages.Â  See Harwell v. Mut. Benefit Health &amp; Accident Assâ€™n, 207\r\n  S.C. 150, 169, 35 S.E.2d 160, 168 (1945) (Baker, C.J., dissenting); see also Kuznik v. Bees Ferry Assocs., 342 S.C. 579, 611, 538 S.E.2d 15, 32\r\n  (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Appellants rely on Kuznik for the notion that acting\r\n  under the advice of counsel is an absolute defense to punitive damages.Â  In Kuznik,\r\n  members of a partnership exercised a contractual right they knew would have\r\n  â€œdevastating legal consequencesâ€ for one of their partners.Â  Id. at 612,\r\n  538 S.E.2d at 32.Â  The master-in-equity found the partners relied on the advice\r\n  of counsel and therefore could not be liable for punitive damages.Â  Id.Â  On appeal, this Court affirmed the masterâ€™s decision, stating advice of counsel\r\n  is a factor that should be considered when determining whether a defendant has\r\n  acted willfully, wantonly, or recklessly.Â  Id.Â  However, this Court\r\n  emphasized advice of counsel is â€œmerely one factor to be consideredâ€ when\r\n  addressing punitive damages.Â  Id.Â   \r\nOther\r\n  than the letter, which Simmons testified he asked his attorney to send,\r\n  Appellants did not present evidence that they received any legal â€œadviceâ€ or\r\n  relied upon that advice.Â  Further, we find Harvey presented evidence of bad\r\n  faith on behalf of Chapman.Â  Because there is some evidence to support the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s decision to submit the issue of punitive damages to the jury, we\r\n  affirm the award of punitive damages.Â Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  find Appellants failed to appeal all three claims submitted to the jury, which\r\n  returned a general verdict, and therefore, the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule applies.Â \r\n  Because the verdict is supported by at least one of the two unappealed claims,\r\n  we affirm the jury verdict and find whether the judge erred in his jury instruction on modification is\r\n  of no consequence.Â  Further, we hold some evidence was presented to submit the\r\n  issue of punitive damages to the jury.Â  Based on the foregoing, the jury\r\n  verdict and damage award isÂ   \r\nAFFIRMED.[1]Â  \r\nSTILWELL,\r\n  SHORT and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-441","title":"State v.

FalknerÂ  Wilkes, of Greenville; for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney John\r\n  W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant\r\n  Attorney General David A. Spencer, of Columbia; Robert M. Ariail, of Greenville;\r\n  for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  Robert Duncan McCall appeals his convictions for the offenses of criminal\r\n  sexual conduct with a minor in the first degree and committing a lewd act upon\r\n  a minor.Â  At issue in this appeal is whether the trial judge erred in denying\r\n  McCallâ€™s motion for an independent psychological examination of the victim.Â  We\r\n  affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nA\r\n  grand jury in Greenville County indicted McCall for the offenses of criminal\r\n  sexual conduct with a minor in the first degree and committing a lewd act on a\r\n  minor.Â  The victim was McCallâ€™s niece by marriage.  \r\nOn\r\n  October 24, 2003, the trial court, Judge Edward W. Miller presiding, held a\r\n  hearing on McCallâ€™s motion to have the victim undergo an independent\r\n  psychological or psychiatric evaluation.Â  In support of the motion, counsel for\r\n  McCall noted the following:Â  (1) the victim was a special needs student; (2)\r\n  the victim went through two rounds of group therapy at a sexual trauma center and\r\n  was told she could not do a third round; (3) the victimâ€™s mother once stated\r\n  the victim wanted to recant her accusations against McCall; (4) the defense was\r\n  willing to pay for the evaluation and had identified three psychiatrists who\r\n  could perform it; (5) the charges against McCall were based in part on\r\n  incidents allegedly occurring as long as six years before the victim came\r\n  forward; (7) the indictments were based primarily on statements by the victim\r\n  and her mother; and (8) there were possible â€œfantasy issuesâ€ between the victim\r\n  and McCall.Â  Counsel further submitted an affidavit with hearsay evidence that\r\n  the victim engaged in masturbation and once allowed a cousin to shave off her\r\n  pubic hair.\r\nIn\r\n  response, the solicitor objected to the motion, noting the victimâ€™s handicaps\r\n  were orthopedic rather than emotional and she was a mainstream student who had\r\n  achieved good grades and did not have behavior\r\n  problems.Â  The solicitor further asserted the therapy the victim received was\r\n  necessitated by the alleged sexual abuse on which the indictments were based and\r\n  problems associated with her physical disabilities rather than on any emotional\r\n  or psychological abnormalities.Â  Similarly, the solicitor averred the excessive\r\n  masturbation could be â€œassociated with a history of sexual abuse.â€Â \r\n  Finally, the solicitor dismissed the shaving incident as a â€œchildhood anticâ€\r\n  that was not indicative of any sexually deviant behavior on the victimâ€™s part.\r\nBy\r\n  written order dated October 24, 2003, Judge Miller denied McCallâ€™s motion for\r\n  an independent evaluation of the victim.Â  In the same order, however, he\r\n  ordered the State â€œto turn over any and all records of psychological evaluation\r\n  of the Victim as soon as possibleâ€ and granted McCall â€œleave to revisit this\r\n  issue if review of these documents shows a compelling need for psychological\r\n  evaluation of the Victim.â€  \r\nFollowing a trial\r\n  by jury before Judge C. Victor Pyle on January 12-15, 2004, McCall was\r\n  convicted of both offenses and received concurrent sentences of twenty years on\r\n  the charge of first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor and fifteen\r\n  years on the charge of lewd act on a minor. This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nRelying on In\r\n  re Michael H., 360 S.C. 540, 602 S.E.2d 729 (2004), both at trial and on\r\n  appeal, McCall asserts his motion to have the victim undergo an independent\r\n  evaluation should have been granted.Â  In addition to the arguments he raised\r\n  during the pre-trial hearing, he also argues on appeal that, during the trial,\r\n  the victimâ€™s allegations changed dramatically from what she related during the\r\n  investigation.Â  Finally, McCall notes that, contrary to Judge Millerâ€™s\r\n  instructions, no treatment records for the victim had been made available to\r\n  him.Â  We hold McCall failed to preserve his arguments for appellate review.\r\nA trial judge has\r\n  the discretion â€œto order a psychological examination in cases in which the\r\n  child is the complaining victimâ€ upon a showing of â€œcompelling need.â€Â  In re\r\n    Michael H., 360 S.C. at 551-52, 602 S.E.2d at 735.Â  The trial judge,\r\n  however, must have the opportunity to determine whether such an examination is\r\n  warranted in a particular case.Â  Id. at 546, 602 S.E.2d at 732.Â   \r\nLike McCall, the\r\n  defendant in Michael H. unsuccessfully moved before the final hearing took\r\n  place to have the complaining witness submit to a psychological evaluation.Â  Id. at 544, 602 S.E.2d at 731.Â  Unlike McCall, however, the defendant in Michael\r\n    H. moved again to have the complainant submit to a psychological evaluation\r\n  after a clinical psychologist treating the complainant testified at trial and\r\n  defense counsel discovered he had not received notes concerning reports by the\r\n  complainant that â€œhe [the complainant] had been hearing voices in his head for\r\n  some time.â€Â  Id. at 544-45, 602 S.E.2d at 731.\r\nIn contrast, during\r\n  the jury trial in the present case, defense counsel made only a passing\r\n  reference to his prior motion to have the victim evaluated, stating at the\r\n  beginning of the hearing, â€œAnd just for the record I would like to note that I\r\n  still objected to that ruling just to protect myself.â€Â  At no time did defense\r\n  counsel expressly argue that the inconsistencies between the victimâ€™s trial\r\n  testimony and her statements during the investigation warranted an order for\r\n  her to submit to a psychological evaluation, and we see no way to construe\r\n  counselâ€™s statements to encompass such an assertion.

(Grandparents) brought this\r\n  action seeking to terminate the parental rights of Vanessa Lee W. (Mother) and\r\n  Dusty Ray S. (Father).Â  Grandparents sought to adopt their granddaughter after\r\n  the termination.Â  The family court found Mother consented to their termination\r\n  and, in its amended order, terminated her parental rights.Â  However, the court\r\n  denied the request to terminate Fatherâ€™s parental rights based on either a\r\n  failure to visit or a failure to support the child.[1] Â \r\nFACTS\r\nThe child was born\r\n  in August 2000, and Mother and Father were living together at the time.Â  In\r\n  2003, Grandparents took custody of the child.Â  Rodney W. (Grandfather)\r\n  testified he visited the childâ€™s home in November 2003 and the child opened the\r\n  door.Â  He was unable to wake the parents, so he took custody of the child.Â  The\r\n  parents finally called later that afternoon.Â  Several days later, Grandfather\r\n  called the home and Mother hung up on him.Â  He again went to the home only to\r\n  find it had been ransacked.Â  In the process of helping clean the house,\r\n  Grandfather found numerous items of drug paraphernalia.Â   \r\nA family court\r\n  order filed December 3, 2004, granted custody to Grandparents and required\r\n  Mother and Father to pay child support.Â  Specifically, Father was ordered to\r\n  pay $50 per week in child support through the court.Â  The order allowed\r\n  supervised visitation for the parents.Â  Fatherâ€™s visitation was supervised by\r\n  his parents.Â   \r\nIn April 2005,\r\n  Father went to jail for violating probation for his unauthorized use of a motor\r\n  vehicle.Â  At the same time, he was on probation in North Carolina for felony\r\n  fleeing, alluding arrest in a motor vehicle, possession of a schedule two\r\n  narcotic, driving while license is revoked, speeding, and public passing.Â  Upon\r\n  his release in South Carolina in October 2005, he had to spend a month in jail\r\n  in North Carolina.Â  While in jail, he sent at least one letter to his daughter,\r\n  but he did not pay any child support.Â  He called to speak to his daughter\r\n  either while in jail or once he got out.\r\nAfter he was\r\n  released, Father failed to make most of his required child support payments;\r\n  however, he had difficulty obtaining a job upon his release.Â  In addition, he\r\n  had little to no visitation with his daughter after his release.Â  The parties\r\n  dispute the reason for the lack of visitation.Â   \r\nIn January 2006,\r\n  Grandparents brought this action to terminate the parental rights of Mother and\r\n  Father.Â  The action was brought against Father on the grounds that he willfully\r\n  failed to support and willfully failed to visit his daughter for a period of at\r\n  least six months.Â  Grandparents sought to adopt the child.Â  Mother signed a\r\n  relinquishment of rights and consented to the adoption prior to trial.Â  Father, pro se, contested the TPR action and the adoption.\r\nThe family court\r\n  issued an order finding Fatherâ€™s failure to support and failure to visit was\r\n  not willful.Â  The court found he was incarcerated and had difficulty obtaining\r\n  work.Â  The family court noted he paid some child support and had regular\r\n  visitation prior to going to jail.Â  The court denied the termination of\r\n  Motherâ€™s parental rights.Â  The court did not address whether termination would\r\n  be in the best interest of the child.\r\nGrandparents filed\r\n  a motion to reconsider, arguing they provided sufficient proof of Fatherâ€™s\r\n  failure to support and visit.Â  They maintained Mother voluntarily relinquished\r\n  her rights and the court should have terminated her rights.Â  The court agreed\r\n  Motherâ€™s rights should have been terminated.Â  However, the court found\r\n  Grandparents failed to carry their burden of proof to show Fatherâ€™s failure to\r\n  support and visit was willful.Â  The court, therefore, denied the termination of\r\n  Fatherâ€™s parental rights.Â  Again, the court did not address the best interest\r\n  of the child.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSection\r\n  20-7-1578 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) mandates that the TPR\r\n  statutes â€œmust be liberally construed in order to ensure prompt judicial\r\n  procedures for freeing minor children from the custody and control of their\r\n  parents by terminating the parent-child relationship.â€Â  See also Joiner\r\n    v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 536 S.E.2d 372 (2000) (overruling prior cases\r\n  calling for strict construction of the TPR statutes).Â  â€œThe interests of the\r\n  child shall prevail if the childâ€™s interest and the parental rights conflict.â€Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann.Â  Â§ 20-7-1578.Â  Grounds for termination of parental rights must\r\n  be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of\r\n    Soc. Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 608-09, 582 S.E.2d 419, 423 (2003)\r\n  (citing Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 102 S. Ct. 1388, 71 L. Ed. 2d\r\n  599 (1982)).\r\nIn\r\n  appeals from the family court, this court may find facts in accordance with its\r\n  own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Rutherford v.\r\n    Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992); Owens v.\r\n      Owens, 320 S.C. 543, 546, 466 S.E.2d 373, 375 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  However,\r\n  this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s\r\n  findings.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616,\r\n  617 (1981).Â  Nor must we ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and\r\n  heard witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and\r\n  assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276\r\n  S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981); Miles v. Miles, 355 S.C. 511,\r\n  516, 586 S.E.2d 136, 139 (Ct. App.Â  2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGrandparents\r\n  contend the family court erred in finding Fatherâ€™s failure to visit and failure\r\n  to support his child for six months was not willful due at least in part to his\r\n  incarceration.Â  They maintain the court used the wrong standard in considering\r\n  Fatherâ€™s incarceration as a mitigating factor.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  family court may order the termination of parental rights upon a finding of one\r\n  or more of eleven statutory grounds and a finding that termination is in the\r\n  best interest of the child.Â  The relevant grounds in this case are:\r\n\r\n\t(3)Â  The child has lived outside the home of either\r\n  parent for a period of six months, and during that time the parent has wilfully\r\n  failed to visit the child.Â  The court may attach little or no weight to\r\n  incidental visitations, but it must be shown that the parent was not prevented\r\n  from visiting by the party having custody or by court order.Â  The distance of\r\n  the childâ€™s placement from the parentâ€™s home must be taken into consideration\r\n  when determining the ability to visit;\r\n\t(4)Â  The child has lived outside the home of either\r\n  parent for a period of six months, and during that time the parent has wilfully\r\n  failed to support the child.Â  Failure to support means that the parent has\r\n  failed to make a material contribution to the childâ€™s care.Â  A material\r\n  contribution consists of either financial contribution according to the\r\n  parentâ€™s means or contributions of food, clothing, shelter, or other\r\n  necessities for the care of the child according to the parentâ€™s means.Â  The\r\n  court may consider all relevant circumstances in determining whether or not the\r\n  parent has willfully failed to support the child, including requests for support\r\n  by the custodian and the ability of the parent to provide support â€¦.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2005).Â   \r\n\r\nWillful\r\n  conduct is conduct that â€œevinces a settled purpose to forego parental duties â€¦\r\n  because it manifests a conscious indifference to the rights of the child to\r\n  receive support and consortium from the parent.â€Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs.\r\n    v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 53, 413 S.E.2d 835, 838 (1992).Â  Whether a parent\r\n  has willfully failed to visit or support his or her child is a â€œquestion of\r\n  intent to be determined from the facts and circumstances of each individual\r\n  case.â€Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 610, 582\r\n  S.E.2d 419, 423 (2003); Stinecipher v. Ballington, 366 S.C. 92, 98, 620\r\n  S.E.2d 93, 96 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  The family court has wide discretion to make\r\n  this determination, but the element of willfulness must be established by clear\r\n  and convincing evidence.Â  Broome, 307 S.C. at 52, 413 S.E.2d at 838.Â \r\n  â€œThe court may consider all relevant circumstances in determining whether or\r\n  not the parent has willfully failed to support the child, including â€¦ the\r\n  ability of the parent to provide support.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann.Â  Â§ 20-7-1572.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\nIncarceration\r\n  alone is insufficient to justify TPR.Â  See S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs.\r\n    v. Wilson, 344 S.C. 332, 337, 543 S.E.2d 580, 583 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  In Wilson, the father was incarcerated after the birth of his three children.Â  We\r\n  reversed the family courtâ€™s grant of TPR, holding that â€œ[t]erminating the\r\n  parental rights of an incarcerated parent requires consideration of all of the\r\n  surrounding facts and circumstances in the determination of wilfullness.â€Â  Id. at 340, 543 S.E.2d at 584.Â  We noted the record was replete with evidence of not\r\n  only the fatherâ€™s repeated requests to the Department to visit his children,\r\n  but the Departmentâ€™s active role in thwarting the fatherâ€™s attempts to visit\r\n  his children.Â  Id. at 338, 543 S.E.2d at 583.Â   \r\n\r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, everyone acknowledges Father regularly maintained his\r\n  visitation prior to his incarceration, seeing his daughter at least once a\r\n  month until his incarceration.Â  Upon incarceration, his efforts to maintain\r\n  contact greatly diminished.Â  He only sent a couple letters and made a couple\r\n  phone calls.Â  He offered no explanation for the drop off in contact.Â  Father\r\n  asserted at the hearing that, after he was released from incarceration, he and\r\n  his grandparents attempted to obtain visitation from Grandparents. Father\r\n  claimed he was told that Grandparents had to discuss the possibility of\r\n  visitation with their attorneys.Â  As a result, there was no visitation by\r\n  Father after he was released.Â  The evidence is not nearly as strong as that\r\n  provided in the Wilson case.Â  However, the family court concluded\r\n  Grandparents had not met their burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence\r\n  that the failure to visit was willful.Â  Accordingly, the courtâ€™s determination\r\n  should be given deference.Â   \r\n\r\nAs\r\n  to the failure to support, there is significantly less evidence in Fatherâ€™s\r\n  favor.Â  He made almost no payments to Grandparents prior to the December 3\r\n  order.Â  After the order, he made no payments through the court as required\r\n  until December 2005.Â  In total, he only made $110 in payments, and, at the time\r\n  of the hearing, was in arrears $3,932.50.Â  Even if the period of his incarceration\r\n  and the time he was unemployed were considered excused, he never made payments\r\n  through the court as he was supposed to prior to his incarceration.Â  In\r\n  addition, he only made two total payments between his release in November 2005\r\n  and the hearing in May 2006.\r\n\r\nFather\r\n  testified he made some payments to Grandparents after they first obtained\r\n  custody.Â  He testified that he had a hard time finding employment after he was\r\n  released from incarceration.Â  Additionally, he admitted he did not pay â€œlike I\r\n  was supposed to.â€Â  Finally, he testified that he has withheld support due to\r\n  his inability to obtain visitation with his child since his incarceration.\r\n\r\nIn\r\n  looking at the family court history of payments, he has only made two payments\r\n  through the court between December 2004 and May 2006.Â  Even if the\r\n  incarceration and the subsequent unemployment were omitted, he still went\r\n  significant periods of time without making payments of support as ordered by\r\n  the court.Â  The only mitigating factor is the failure of the Grandparents to\r\n  show how much Father could have paid.Â  Father admitted he was employed prior to\r\n  his incarceration and did not make payments as he should.Â  In addition, he\r\n  admitted that, at the time of the hearing, he was making about $600 per month\r\n  and failed to provide support. Accordingly, this court finds by clear and\r\n  convincing evidence that Father failed to support his child.Â  Â \r\n\r\nWhen\r\n  adjudicating a TPR case, the best interests of the child are paramount.Â  S.C.\r\n    Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 298, 547 S.E.2d 506, 511 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Once a statutory ground has been proven, section 20-7-1572 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) requires that the best interest of the child must be\r\n  served by termination of parental rights.Â  Our supreme court has held that the\r\n  termination of parental rights statute should be liberally construed consistent\r\n  with the purpose to facilitate prompt adoption and the best interest of the\r\n  child.Â  Joiner v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 536 S.E.2d 372 (2000).\r\n\r\nHere,\r\n  we conclude that the issue of the best interest of the child should be remanded\r\n  to the family court for a full evidentiary hearing on this issue.Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we find Grandparents met their burden to show Father\r\n  willfully failed to support his child.Â  We find the issue of the best interest\r\n  of the child should be remanded to the family court for a full evidentiary\r\n  hearing on this issue.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the family court is\r\n\r\nREVERSEDÂ  AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., AND\r\n  ANDERSON, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-460","title":"Dawkins v.

(2) Wife would\r\n  furnish the tools and parts for Husbandâ€™s repair of the vehicles; (3) Husband\r\n  and Wife would agree upon a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) who would conduct\r\n  an audit, determine the money received, the automobiles sold, the expenses paid,\r\n  and the money disbursed; (4) Wonketia Dawkins (the partiesâ€™ daughter) would\r\n  manage and collect rent from the partiesâ€™ mutually owned rental properties and make\r\n  a monthly accounting; (5) Husband and Wife would make an accounting of rent collected\r\n  by either party prior to the order date; and (6) either party could petition\r\n  for relief from the terms of the order.\r\nOn\r\n  November 14, 2002, Husband filed an Answer and Counterclaim to Wifeâ€™s initial\r\n  Complaint requesting control over Dawkins Automotive and the business records\r\n  in Wifeâ€™s possession.Â  At a follow-up hearing held December 3, 2002, Husband\r\n  contended Wife failed to provide business records and was uncooperative with\r\n  the repair and sale of vehicles for Dawkins Automotive.Â   \r\nAn\r\n  order dated January 8, 2003, was issued:Â  (1) compelling the parties to present\r\n  receipts and expenses related to the rental properties, received since the date\r\n  of separation; (2) prohibiting the parties from accepting any rent or making\r\n  any payments on behalf of the rental properties; (3) requiring Wonketia Dawkins\r\n  to provide rental reports for November and December of 2002, as well as every\r\n  month thereafter, showing all rent received and all expenses paid; (4)\r\n  instructing the parties to produce a complete accounting of income and expenses\r\n  related to the sale of used cars, both personally and for Dawkins Automotive; (5)\r\n  commanding Husband to provide a written document on each car to be repaired to\r\n  Wife, listing the needed parts, where they can be purchased, and their approximate\r\n  cost; (6) dictating that Wife review the car repair documents with Husband and\r\n  either provide him with the parts or the funds to obtain the parts; (7)\r\n  directing the parties to give an inventory of all equipment in their respective\r\n  possessions; and (8) stating when either party receives the income tax refund\r\n  for 2001, provide it immediately to their attorney.\r\nIn\r\n  January of 2004, Husband filed a motion requesting the information previously\r\n  ordered by the court on January 8, 2003, and a hearing was held on January 29,\r\n  2004.Â  On February 10, 2004, a temporary order was issued expressing the family\r\n  courtâ€™s dissatisfaction with the extent of compliance with the prior order.Â  It\r\n  directed the parties to comply by providing:Â   \r\n\r\n\tEach\r\n  asset must be reviewed separately as to income and expenses to properly\r\n  account.Â  Beginning August 18, 2002, both parties must therefore provide the\r\n  Court and the other party an accounting of each asset (by the name of the\r\n  asset) on which either has received income and all incurred expenses, supported\r\n  by receipts and cancelled checks.Â  This includes automobiles and real estate.Â \r\n  Either party can then see what the other contends about a particular asset and\r\n  the Court can determine whether there has been a net gain or a net loss on any\r\n  particular asset.\r\n\tWonketia\r\n  Dawkins must provide by location of each rental property, an accounting of all\r\n  rent received and all expenses paid beginning November 1, 2002.Â  Again this\r\n  will allow the parties and the Court to view each asset separately and make a\r\n  determination of net gain or net loss.\r\n\tBoth\r\n  Plaintiff and Defendant must provide the other and this Court a list of all\r\n  vehicles in his/her possession on August 18, 2002 as well as any vehicles\r\n  acquired or sold subsequent to that date to include name of vehicles, to whom\r\n  sold, purchase price, sales price, expenses to repair and monthly payments, if\r\n  any.\r\n\tAll of\r\n  the aforesaid must be provided by the parties to their respective attorneys\r\n  within 10 days.Â  In addition Wonketia Dawkins is hereby named as a party\r\n  defendant and she is to be served with a copy of this Order and required to\r\n  comply with the accounting within 10 days after service.\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n  Husband sought a Rule to Show Cause alleging Wife was not producing rental\r\n  information or other court ordered documents, Wife presented a voluminous box\r\n  of documents at a hearing on May 4, 2004.Â  From the hearing, a temporary order\r\n  was entered on June 14, 2004, continuing the hearing and stating that it\r\n  appeared Wife and Wonketia Dawkins complied with the prior order, and the\r\n  matter may be rescheduled if necessary.\r\nOn\r\n  October 5, 2005, the court held a status conference where it required Wife to\r\n  present within thirty days:Â  (1) index cards of paid out accounts for car sales;\r\n  (2) monthly reports filed with the South Carolina Tax Commission beginning with\r\n  September 2002; (3) a list of automobiles sold and their respective buyers for\r\n  the years of 2004 and 2005; (4) income and expense information on the rental\r\n  properties for 2004 and 2005; and (5) a composition book of Husbandâ€™s recorded\r\n  car sales, if available.Â  In addition, the court instructed Husband to provide an\r\n  accounting of the following within thirty days:Â  (1) maintenance proceeds; (2) rents\r\n  received from two of the rental properties; and (3) all car sales.\r\nAs a\r\n  result of Wifeâ€™s non-production of the documents outlined in the status conference,\r\n  Husband filed a petition requesting a Rule to Show Cause and the hearing was\r\n  held on December 15, 2005.Â  At the hearing, Wife presented a plethora of\r\n  documents purported to contain the information requested.Â  Under the assumption\r\n  the CPA would be able to find the necessary data to construct his report, the\r\n  hearing was continued by an order dated December 28, 2005.\r\nOn\r\n  December 19, 2005, Husband filed a Rule to Show Cause alleging Wife had not\r\n  complied with the prior orders of the court.Â  This petition was scheduled to be\r\n  heard at the final hearing on January 11, 2006.Â  A divorce decree was entered\r\n  on March 19, 2006, providing in relevant parts:\r\n\r\n\tR.&nbsp;&nbsp; Distribution List Follows.\r\n\tThe\r\n  marital properties and debts shall be divided pursuant to the list attached\r\n  hereto.Â  While the Plaintiff is to receive more than the Defendant, the\r\n  Plaintiff is taking responsibility for all the marital debt which is secured by\r\n  the properties that she is receiving.Â  The Court has considered the relative\r\n  fault in the breakup of the marriage as well as the Plaintiffâ€™s earnest and\r\n  commendable efforts in maintaining the parties [sic] properties and good credit\r\n  during the pendency of this action.Â  Assets received by the Defendant are debt\r\n  free.Â  Further, the Plaintiff needs the assets that she will be receiving to\r\n  support herself in the future.Â  Both parties should cooperate in the signing of\r\n  any documents necessary to comply with the terms of this Orderâ€¦.\r\n\t10.Â  The\r\n  Court finds that in regard to attorney [sic] fees both parties have contributed\r\n  to the prolonged contentiousness of this case.Â  However, the most significant\r\n  act, or failure to act was that of the Plaintiff in not timely producing the\r\n  September 2002 accounts receivable list with the supporting documentation.Â  The\r\n  Court finds that had this been done in a timely manner, this case may have very\r\n  well have been less expensive and been ready for trial earlier.Â  The Court\r\n  considers this factor in the request for attorneyâ€™s fees rather than as a\r\n  separate contempt issue.Â  The Plaintiff shall contribute $7,500.00 toward the\r\n  Defendantâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees within six months of the date of this Order paying\r\n  this directly to Mr. Thompson.Â  In consideration of his fault in the break up\r\n  of the marriage, [t]he Defendant shall contribute $3,000.00 toward the\r\n  Plaintiffâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees within six months of the date of this Order paying\r\n  this amount directly to Mrs. Bridges.Â  The remaining legal expenses shall be paid\r\n  the party incurring them.\r\n\r\nHusband\r\n  filed a Motion for Reconsideration pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  On May 18,\r\n  2006, an amended divorce decree was entered which modified the original order,\r\n  in relevant part:Â   \r\n\r\n\tPage 11,\r\n  R.Â  Distribution List Follows.Â  The following paragraph should be substituted.\r\n\tThe\r\n  marital properties and debts shall be divided pursuant to the amended and\r\n  modified asset distribution list attached hereto, wherein the Plaintiff will be\r\n  receiving 60% of the marital assets, and the Defendant 40%.Â  The Court has\r\n  considered the relative fault in the breakup of the marriage, as well as\r\n  Plaintiffâ€™s earnest and commendable efforts in maintaining the parties [sic] assets\r\n  and good credit during the pendency of this action.Â  Consideration has also\r\n  been given to the fact that Defendantâ€™s real estate assets are all debt free,\r\n  while Plaintiff takes with hers a debt obligation of $140,937.Â  The only real\r\n  estate taken by Plaintiff lien free is the property occupied by the partiesâ€™\r\n  daughter, and for which neither party required the payment of rent prior to\r\n  their separation.\r\n\tAdditionally,\r\n  Plaintiff will have the right to operate the business known as Dawkins Auto\r\n  free of any claims by the Defendant.Â  To accomplish a final distribution, the\r\n  Plaintiff owes the Defendant $21,422.00, which is to be paid in full by July 1,\r\n  2007.\r\n\tThe\r\n  remaining requests by the Defendant to Alter and/or Amend are hereby denied,\r\n  and the March 19, 2006 order remains in full force and effect, except as herein\r\n  as modified.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\tDid the family court err in\r\n  apportioning the marital property in a sixty/forty division, granting Wife sixty\r\n  percent of the marital estate?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2. \r\n\t\t\tDid the family court err in denying\r\n  Husband a special equity in the workersâ€™ compensation award and the marital\r\n  home?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDid the family court err by\r\n  allocating Dawkins Automotive to Wife when dividing the marital assets?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t4.\r\n\t\t\tDid the family court err by\r\n  instructing Husband to pay Wife $3,000 toward her attorneyâ€™s fee while only\r\n  awarding Husband $7,500 from Wife for his attorneyâ€™s fee?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  appeals from the family court, this court may find facts in accordance with its\r\n  own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Nasser-Moghaddassi v.\r\n    Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. 182, 189, 612 S.E.2d 707, 711 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Emery v. Smith, 361 S.C. 207, 213, 603 S.E.2d 598, 601 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004)).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require this court to\r\n  disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Lacke v. Lacke, 362 S.C. 302,\r\n  307, 608 S.E.2d 147, 149 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Bowers v. Bowers, 349\r\n  S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002)); Badeaux v. Davis, 337\r\n  S.C. 195, 202, 522 S.E.2d 835, 838 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Nor must we ignore the\r\n  fact that the family court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a\r\n  better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to\r\n  their testimony.Â  Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623\r\n  (2003) (citing Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157\r\n  (1996)).Â  However, our broad scope of review does not relieve the appellant of\r\n  the burden of convincing this court the family court committed error.Â  Nasser-Moghaddassi,\r\n  364 S.C. at 190, 612 S.E. 2d at 711 (citing Skinner v. King, 272 S.C.\r\n  520, 522-23, 252 S.E.2d 891, 892 (1979)).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.&nbsp; Equitable Division of\r\n  Marital Property\r\nHusband\r\n  asserts the family court erred when apportioning the marital estate in a sixty/forty\r\n  split in favor of Wife.Â  We agree.Â  The appropriate division of property is a fifty/fifty\r\n  partition to each spouse.\r\nThe\r\n  apportionment of marital property is within the discretion of the family court\r\n  judge and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  See Morris\r\n    v. Morris, 295 S.C. 37, 39, 367 S.E.2d 24, 25 (1988).Â  Section 20-7-472 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) provides fifteen factors the family court\r\n  must consider, giving each weight as it determines.Â  These factors are:Â  (1) the\r\n  duration of the marriage, (2) any marital misconduct or fault and its effect on\r\n  the break-up of the marriage, (3) the value of marital property and the\r\n  contribution of each spouse in the acquisition, preservation, depreciation, or\r\n  appreciation, including the contribution of a homemaker, (4) the income and\r\n  earning potential of each spouse and opportunity for future acquisition of\r\n  assets, (5) the health, both physical and emotional, of each spouse, (6) the need\r\n  of either spouse for additional training or education, (7) the nonmarital\r\n  property of each spouse, (8) the existence or nonexistence of vested retirement\r\n  benefits for each spouse, (9) whether alimony has been awarded, (10) the desirability\r\n  of awarding the family home, (11) the tax consequence to each spouse as a\r\n  result of the apportionment, (12) the existence and extent of any support\r\n  obligations of either party, (13) any liens and encumbrances on marital and\r\n  separate property and other existing debts, (14) any child custody arrangements\r\n  and obligations, and (15) any other relevant factors as the trial court shall\r\n  expressly enumerate in its order.Â  S.C.

Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2006).\r\nOn\r\n  review, this Court looks to the fairness of the overall apportionment, and if\r\n  the end result is equitable, the fact that this court might have weighed\r\n  specific factors differently than the family court is irrelevant.Â  Johnson\r\n    v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300-01, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988); see Doe v. Doe, 324 S.C. 492, 502, 478 S.E.2d 854, 859 (Ct. App. 1996) (The\r\n  reviewing court will affirm the family court judgeâ€™s apportionment of marital\r\n  property if it can be determined that the judge addressed the relevant factors\r\n  under section 20-7-472 with sufficiency for the reviewing court to conclude the\r\n  judge was cognizant of the statutory factors.).\r\nThe\r\n  court may acknowledge the grounds for divorce when apportioning the marital estate.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472(2) (Supp. 2006).Â  However, a severe penalty for fault\r\n  is prohibited:Â  â€œAlthough fault does not justify a severe penalty in making a\r\n  division of marital property, it is a factor the court may consider in\r\n  determining the equities between spouses.â€ Rampey v.

Craig, 358 S.C. 548, 557, 595\r\n  S.E.2d 837, 842 (Ct.

App. 1987)\r\n  (approving a fifty-fifty apportionment of marital property after a twenty-two\r\n  year marriage).\r\nIn Doe\r\n  v. Doe, 370 S.C. 206, 215, 634 S.E.2d 51, 56 (Ct. App. 2006), the\r\n  family court partitioned the marital estate in a seventy/thirty proportion in\r\n  favor of the husband considering the wifeâ€™s marital misconduct.Â  Id. at 214, 634 S.E.2d at 55.Â  We found this division to be inequitable and\r\n  re-assigned the estate in a sixty/forty distribution.Â  Id. at 215, 634\r\n  S.E.2d at 56.Â  This Court elucidated:\r\n\r\n\tIn light\r\n  of the marriageâ€™s longevity, our prohibition against imposing a severe penalty\r\n  for fault, and the family courtâ€™s erroneous consideration of Dr. Woodsideâ€™s\r\n  testimony, we find the family court abused its discretion when it awarded\r\n  Husband seventy percent of the marital estate.Â  We believe the more equitable\r\n  division would be sixty percent to Husband and forty percent to Wife.\r\n\r\nId. at 216; 634 S.E.2d at 57.Â  Doe is\r\n  distinguished from the present case because the wifeâ€™s marital misconduct\r\n  consisted of a twenty year adulterous relationship, resulting in a daughter.Â  Id. at 211, 634 S.E.2d at 54.Â  The wife led the husband to believe he fathered the\r\n  child when the biological father was actually the wifeâ€™s paramour, a longtime\r\n  family friend.Â  Id.\r\nWidman\r\n  v. Widman, 348 S.C. 97, 557 S.E.2d\r\n  693 (Ct. App. 2001), upheld an equal division of the marital estate under\r\n  circumstances similar to the instant case.Â  In Widman, the court granted\r\n  the wife a divorce on the ground of adultery, ending a sixteen year marriage.Â  Id. at 108, 557 S.E.2d at 699.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\tâ€œIn its\r\n  decree, the trial court found [the wife] to be in willful violation of the\r\n  courtâ€™s order for (1) failing to file proper financial declarations as previously\r\n  ordered, (2) disclosing information to [the husbandâ€™s] parents and adult\r\n  daughter regarding [his] prior adulterous conduct, and (3) intentionally\r\n  withholding the existence of a trust which was the subject of a motion to\r\n  compel.â€Â  \r\n\r\nId.Â  The court applied the fifteen factors of South\r\n  Carolina Code section 20-7-472 (Supp. 2006) and found an equitable division of\r\n  property to be a fifty-fifty split between the parties.Â  Id. at 111, 557\r\n  S.E.2d at 700-701.\r\nIn\r\n  the case sub judice, the family court stated several facts\r\n  relevant to its equitable division of the marital estate.Â  The court considered\r\n  (1) Husbandâ€™s adulterous affair and its contribution to the break up of the\r\n  marriage, (2) Wifeâ€™s efforts in maintaining the assets and good credit during\r\n  the pendency of this action, (3) the liens and encumbrances on the property\r\n  allotted to each party, and (4) Wifeâ€™s future support needs.\r\nThe\r\n  overall distribution was sixty percent of the estate to Wife and forty percent\r\n  to Husband for a marriage which lasted twenty-two years.Â  We hold this distribution\r\n  is not equitable.Â  There is no evidence the family court considered the\r\n  duration of the marriage or Wifeâ€™s disregard of court orders.Â  Given the\r\n  fifteen factors in South Carolina Code section 20-7-472 (Supp. 2006), the\r\n  prohibition of severe penalty for fault, Rampey, 286 S.C. 153, 156, 332\r\n  S.E.2d 213, 214 (Ct. App. 1985); Simmons, 275 S.C. 41, 44-45, 267 S.E.2d\r\n  427, 429 (1980), and the trend in case law for an equal apportionment of\r\n  property, we reverse the family courtâ€™s sixty-forty split and hold a\r\n  fifty-fifty division is appropriate.\r\n2.&nbsp; Special Equity and\r\n  Characterization of Property as Marital v. Nonmarital\r\nHusband\r\n  asserts the family court erred by not granting him a special equity in the\r\n  workersâ€™ compensation award.Â  We disagree.Â  Next, Husband contends the family\r\n  courtâ€™s denial of special equity in the marital home was in error.Â  We agree.\r\na.&nbsp; Special Equity\r\nA\r\n  spouse may claim special equity in marital property, as set forth in South\r\n  Carolina Code section 20-7-471 (Supp. 2006):\r\n\r\n\tDuring\r\n  the marriage a spouse shall acquire, based upon the factors set out in Â§\r\n  20-7-472, a vested special equity and ownership right in the marital property\r\n  as defined in Â§ 20-7-473, which equity and ownership right are subject to\r\n  apportionment between the spouses by the family courts of this State at the\r\n  time marital litigation is filed or commenced as provided in Â§ 20-7-472.\r\n\r\nIn Webber\r\n  v. Webber, 285 S.C. 425, 427-428, 330 S.E.2d 79, 81 (Ct. App. 1985), this\r\n  Court articulated:\r\n\r\n\tUnder\r\n  the special equity doctrine, â€œWhere a wife has made a material contribution to\r\n  the husbandâ€™s acquisition of property during coverture, she acquires a special\r\n  equity in the property.â€Â  Wilson v. Wilson, 270 S.C. 216, 241 S.E.2d\r\n  566, 568 (1978) (quoting 27B C.J.S. Divorce Â§ 293 (1950)).Â  Therefore,\r\n  one spouse acquires a special equity in the property of the other if (1) the\r\n  property was acquired during coverture, (2) the spouse contributed to the\r\n  acquisition of the property, and (3) the spouseâ€™s contribution was material.\r\n\r\nTo\r\n  acquire a special equity in nonmarital property, the property must appreciate\r\n  during marriage or the non-owner spouse must materially contribute to the\r\n  improvement of the property.Â  Webber, 285 S.C. at 428; 330 S.E.2d at 81\r\n  (citing Anderson v. Anderson, 282 S.C. 163, 318 S.E.2d 566, 567\r\n  (1984)).Â  The materiality of the contribution is not expressed in South\r\n  Carolina Code section 20-7-472(3) (Supp. 2006), which states the court should\r\n  examine â€œ[t]he contribution of each spouse to the acquisition, preservation,\r\n  depreciation, or appreciation in value of the marital property, including the\r\n  contribution of the spouse as a homemaker; provided, that the court shall\r\n  consider the quality of the contribution as well as its factual existenceâ€ when\r\n  valuing and dividing property upon apportionment.Â  However, the statute directs\r\n  the court to look at the â€œqualityâ€ and â€œfactual existenceâ€ of the\r\n  contribution.Â  Id.Â   \r\nb.&nbsp; Characterization of\r\n  Property as Marital v. Nonmarital\r\nSection\r\n  20-7-473 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) defines marital property and\r\n  nonmarital property:\r\nThe term\r\n  â€œmarital propertyâ€ as used in this article means all real and personal property\r\n  which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned\r\n  as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation as provided in Â§\r\n  20-7-742 regardless of how legal title is held, except the following, which\r\n  constitute nonmarital property:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(1)&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tproperty acquired by either \r\n\t\t\tparty by inheritance, devise, bequest, or gift from a party other \r\n\t\t\tthan the spouse;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(2) \r\n\t\t\tproperty acquired by either \r\n\t\t\tparty before the marriage and property acquiring after the happening \r\n\t\t\tof the earliest of (a) entry of a pendent lite order in a divorce or separate maintenance\r\n  action; (b) formal signing of a written property or marital settlement\r\n  agreement; or (c) entry of a permanent order of separate maintenance and\r\n  support or of a permanent order approving a property or marital settlement\r\n  agreement between the parties;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(3) \r\n\t\t\tproperty acquired by either \r\n\t\t\tparty in exchange for property described in items (1) and (2) of \r\n\t\t\tthis section;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tproperty excluded by written \r\n\t\t\tcontract of the parties.&nbsp; â€œWritten contractâ€ includes any antenuptial agreement\r\n  of the parties which must be considered presumptively fair and equitable so\r\n  long as it was voluntarily executed with both parties separately represented by\r\n  counsel and pursuant to the full financial disclosure to each other that is\r\n  mandated by the rules of the family court as to income, debts, and assets;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(5)&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tany increase in value in nonmarital property, except to the extent that the increase resulted directly\r\n  or indirectly from efforts of the other spouse during marriage.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\tInterspousal\r\n  gifts of property, including gifts of property from one spouse to the other\r\n  made indirectly by way of a third party, are marital property which is subject\r\n  to division.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\tThe\r\n  court does not have jurisdiction or authority to apportion nonmarital property.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nNevertheless,\r\n  circumstances in which nonmarital property may be transmuted into marital\r\n  property exist:Â  â€œProperty, nonmarital at the time of its acquisition, may be\r\n  transmuted (1) if it becomes so commingled with marital property as to be\r\n  untraceable; (2) if it is titled jointly; or (3) if it is utilized by the\r\n  parties in support of the marriage or in some other manner so as to evidence an\r\n  intent by the parties to make it marital property.â€Â  Johnson v.

Greene, 351 S.C.\r\n  329, 338, 569 S.E.2d 393, 398 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  This evidentiary burden\r\n  consists of â€œobjective evidence showing that, during the marriage, the parties\r\n  themselves regarded the property as the common property of the marriage.â€ Id.Â  The use of non-marital property in support of the marriage without intent to\r\n  treat or characterize the property as marital is not sufficient to establish\r\n  that the property was transmuted.Â  Id.\r\ni.&nbsp; Workersâ€™ Compensation Award\r\nHusband\r\n  alleges the family court erred in denying him special equity in the workersâ€™\r\n  compensation award and the benefits should be characterized as nonmarital\r\n  property.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  designation of the workersâ€™ compensation award as marital property is supported\r\n  by Orszula v. Orszula, 292 S.C. 264, 356 S.E.2d 114 (1987), which held:Â \r\n  â€œWages clearly fall within [the statutory] definition.Â  We find no error in the\r\n  distribution of a substitute for wages.â€ Id. at 266, 356 S.E.2d at 114.\r\nSpecial\r\n  equity is appropriate when a spouse acquires property during the marriage, or\r\n  when there is an increase in value of property attributable to the non-owner\r\n  spouseâ€™s material contribution.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-471 (Supp. 2006); Calhoun\r\n    v. Calhoun, 339 S.C. 96, 106, 529 S.E.2d 14, 20 (2000); Murray v.\r\n      Murray, 312 S.C. 154, 159, 439 S.E.2d 312, 316 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\n \r\nHusband\r\n  argues because the benefits were awarded for his disability and not as a\r\n  substitution of wages, they should be characterized as nonmarital property.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  Husband was granted the workersâ€™ compensation award incident to his\r\n  injury while employed with John Montgomery Development in 1995.Â  This occurred\r\n  during his marriage and his benefits are marital property under both the\r\n  statutory definition in South Carolina Code section 20-7-473 (Supp. 2006) and\r\n  the characterization in Orszula.Â   \r\nHusband\r\n  contends he should be granted a special equity in the workersâ€™ compensation\r\n  award.Â  He relies on Cooksey v. Cooksey, 280 S.C. 347, 312 S.E.2d 581\r\n  (Ct. App. 1984), stating:Â  â€œBased on the reasoning in Cooksey, the\r\n  Husband should have been given an extra portion of the marital assets, because\r\n  had it not been for the Husbandâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation award, the parties\r\n  would not have had the family business known as Dawkins Automotive.â€Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  Cooksey depicts a situation in which special equity was\r\n  awarded for an inheritance which was transmuted into marital property.Â  Id. at 352, 312 S.E.2d at 585.Â  Inheritances are nonmarital under the definition of South\r\n  Carolina Code section 20-7-471(1) (Supp. 2006), whereas workersâ€™ compensation\r\n  awards are marital.Â  Orszula, at 266, 365 S.E.2d at 114.Â  Special equity\r\n  is not appropriate for Husbandâ€™s investment of marital property into the family\r\n  business of Dawkins Automotive.\r\nWe\r\n  find the Husband is not entitled to a special equity in the workersâ€™\r\n  compensation award.Â   \r\nii.&nbsp; Marital Home (532 McCluney Drive)\r\nHusband\r\n  professes the family court erred in failing to find he was entitled to a\r\n  special equity in the marital home.Â  We agree.\r\nGifts\r\n  from parties other than oneâ€™s spouse during coverture are nonmarital in nature\r\n  and not subject to equitable division upon divorce.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-743\r\n  (Supp. 2006); Canady v. Canady, 296 S.C. 521, 524, 374 S.E.2d 502, 504\r\n  (Ct.

App. 1986)).Â  However, nonmarital property may be transmuted\r\n  into marital property by commingling with marital property, titling it jointly,\r\n  or using it to support the marriage with the intent to characterize the\r\n  property as marital.Â  Canady, at 524, 374 S.E.2d at 504 (citing Wyatt\r\n    v. Wyatt, 293 S.C. 495, 361 S.E.2d 777 (Ct. App. 1987)).Â  The court must\r\n  examine the intent of the parties when nonmarital property is used in support\r\n  of the marriage.Â  Canady, at 524, 374 S.E.2d at 504 (citing Johnson\r\n    v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 295, 372 S.E.2d 107, 110 (Ct. App. 1988)).\r\nIn\r\n  the case at bar, family court concluded 532 McCluney Drive was marital property.Â \r\n  The issue was litigated and the court found the property was used in support of\r\n  marriage and the partiesâ€™ actions convey intent to treat it as marital:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  Defendantâ€™s mother, Cora Dawkins, purchased this land for investment/rental property\r\n  in 1987.Â  In 1988, the parties moved in to this home and paid rent/mortgage,\r\n  until December 1994, when Cora Dawkins deeded the property to Defendant for\r\n  $10.00 love and affection.Â  The Defendant did extensive remodeling to the home\r\n  over the years. Â The parties agree that the home is now worth $71,000.00 and\r\n  that there is an outstanding mortgage of $49,566.00 (Plaintiffâ€™s Exhibit Number\r\n  8 and Defendantâ€™s Exhibit Number 36).Â  All payments were made from marital\r\n  funds prior to the separation and the Plaintiff has made the mortgage, tax and\r\n  insurance payments through the parties [sic] business account since the\r\n  separation.Â  The Court finds that this is marital property, that the Defendant\r\n  is not entitled to a special equity in this property and that there is\r\n  $21,434.00 equity subject to equitable distribution.\r\n\r\nWhile not objecting\r\n  to the homeâ€™s characterization, Husband contends that the family court should\r\n  award him a special equity representative of the gift from his mother.Â  Cooksey\r\n    v. Cooksey, 280 S.C. 347, 312 S.E.2d 581 (Ct. App. 1984), supports the\r\n  Husbandâ€™s argument for a special equity.Â  In Cooksey, a transmutation of\r\n  inherited non-marital property into marital property did not extinguish the\r\n  inheritorâ€™s right for special equitable consideration upon divorce.Â  This court\r\n  explicated:\r\n\r\n\tClearly,\r\n  Mr. Cookseyâ€™s inheritance was commingled with and used as marital property.Â  We\r\n  find, therefore, that the family court properly included it in the marital\r\n  estate and subjected it to equitable distribution.Â  It does not follow,\r\n  however, that Mr. Cooksey was entitled to recoup none of his inheritanceâ€¦.\r\n\tThe\r\n  failure of the family court to consider restoring Mr. Cookseyâ€™s inheritance to\r\n  him along with its failure to set forth facts upon which it based its finding that\r\n  he should not be â€œreimbursedâ€ for it was error.Â  On remand, the court is to\r\n  make appropriate factual findings and legal conclusions as to whether Mr.\r\n  Cooksey is entitled to a special equitable consideration upon the distribution\r\n  of the marital assets based on his contribution of his inheritance.\r\n\r\nId. at 353, 312 S.E.2d at 585.\r\nThe initial\r\n  equity in the marital home was a gift to Husband by his mother with a value of\r\n  $25,000.00.Â  Although the gift was transmuted, transmutation did not extinguish\r\n  Husbandâ€™s right to receive a special equity upon divorce.Â  We find Husband is\r\n  entitled to a special equity upon the distribution of the marital assets based\r\n  on his contribution of the gift.\r\nThe\r\n  family court erred in denying Husband a special equity in the marital home.Â  We\r\n  reverse and hold Husband is entitled to a $25,000.00 special equity in the\r\n  marital home.\r\n3.&nbsp; Dawkins Automotive Award to\r\n  Wife\r\nHusband\r\n  claims the family court erred in granting Wife control and ownership of Dawkins\r\n  Automotive.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection\r\n  20-7-476 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) renders authority to the family\r\n  court to divide and sell property during the partitioning of a marital estate:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  court may direct a party to execute and deliver any deed, bill of sale, note,\r\n  mortgage, or other document necessary to carry out its order of equitable\r\n  apportionment.Â  If a party so directed fails to comply, the court may direct\r\n  the clerk of court in the county in which the property involved is situate to\r\n  execute and deliver the document, and this performance by the clerk is as\r\n  effective as the performance of the party would have been.Â  The court in making\r\n  an equitable apportionment may order the public or private sale of all or any\r\n  portion of the marital property upon terms it determines.\r\n\tThe\r\n  court may utilize any other reasonable means to achieve equity between the\r\n  parties, which means are subject to and may not be inconsistent with the other\r\n  provisions of this article and may include making a monetary award to achieve\r\n  an equitable apportionment.Â  Any monetary award made does not constitute a\r\n  payment which is treated as ordinary income to the recipient under either the\r\n  provisions of Chapter 7 of Title 12 or, to the extent lawful, under the United\r\n  States Revenue Code.\r\n\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  â€œ[t]he family court has wide discretion in determining how marital property is\r\n  to be distributed.â€Â  Greene v. Greene, 351 S.C. 329, 341, 569 S.E.2d\r\n  393, 400 (Ct. App. 2002) (citing Murphy v. Murphy, 319 S.C. 324, 329,\r\n  461 S.E.2d 39, 41-42 (1995)).Â  â€œBroad jurisdiction is granted family court\r\n  judges in matters of equitable distribution by Section 20-7-420, Code of Laws\r\n  of South Carolina (1976), and trial judges may employ any reasonable means to\r\n  effectuate an equitable division of the marital estate.â€Â  Bass v. Bass,\r\n  285 S.C. 178, 182, 328 S.E.2d 649, 651 (Ct. App. 1985).\r\n\r\n\tâ€œIf\r\n  possible, all issues between the parties should be resolved at [divorce] so\r\n  that disputes and irritants do not linger and present further incentives to\r\n  litigation.Â  The family courtâ€™s objective should be to dissolve the marriage,\r\n  sever all entangling legal relations and place the parties in a position from\r\n  which they can begin anew.â€Â  \r\n\r\nJohnson v. Johnson, 285 S.C. 308, 311, 329 S.E.2d 443, 445 (Ct. App.\r\n  1985).\r\nThe\r\n  family court in the instant case was acting within its discretion in dividing\r\n  assets between Husband and Wife.Â  Dawkins Automotive was distributed to Wife\r\n  incident to the apportionment of the marital assets. Â This is consistent with Johnsonâ€™s\r\n  objective of severing all legal ties between Husband and Wife.Â  The family court\r\n  has the authority to decide which spouse receives which asset.Â   \r\n4.&nbsp; Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nHusband\r\n  asserts the family court erred in awarding Wife $3,000.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n  and only awarding him $7,500.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees. Â We disagree.\r\nAuthority\r\n  to award attorneyâ€™s fees in a divorce action is found in South Carolina Code section 20-3-130(H) (Supp. 2006):\r\n\r\n\tThe court, from\r\n  time to time after considering the financial resources and marital fault of\r\n  both parties, may order one party to pay a reasonable amount to\r\n  the other for attorney fees, expert fees, investigation fees, costs, and suit\r\n  money incurred in maintaining an action for divorce from the bonds of\r\n  matrimony, as well as in actions for separate maintenance and support,\r\n  including sums for services rendered and costs incurred before the commencement\r\n  of the proceeding and after entry of judgment, pendente lite and permanently.\r\n\r\nAn\r\n  award of attorneyâ€™s fees lies within the sound discretion of the family court\r\n  and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Patel v.\r\n    Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 553, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004); Bowen v. Bowen,\r\n  327 S.C. 561, 563, 490 S.E.2d 271, 272, (Ct. App. 1997).Â  The family court, in\r\n  determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, should consider each partyâ€™s\r\n  ability to pay his or her own fees, the beneficial results obtained, the\r\n  partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions, and the effect of the fee on the\r\n  partiesâ€™ standards of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-477,\r\n  415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  In determining the reasonable amount of attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees to award, the family court should consider the nature, extent, and\r\n  difficulty of the services rendered, the time necessarily devoted to the case,\r\n  counselâ€™s professional standing, the contingency of compensation, the\r\n  beneficial results obtained, and the customary legal fees for similar\r\n  services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313,\r\n  315 (1991); see also Messer v. Messer, 359 S.C. 614, 633, 598\r\n  S.E.2d 310, 320 (Ct. App. 2004) (refusing to find an abuse of discretion as to\r\n  award of attorneyâ€™s fees when the family court analyzed each of the factors,\r\n  detailed its findings in its final order, and those findings were supported by\r\n  affidavits).\r\nIn this\r\n  case, the family court found both parties contributed to the prolongation and\r\n  contentiousness of this matter.Â  The family court held Wifeâ€™s untimely\r\n  production of documents warranted a $7,500.00 award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Husband.Â \r\n  The family court recognized Husbandâ€™s fault in causing the breakup of the\r\n  marriage to be the controlling factor in its decision to grant Wife $3,000.00\r\n  in attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nWe\r\n  find sufficient evidentiary support in the record to uphold the judgeâ€™s award\r\n  of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Accordingly, we hold the court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion in this instance.Â  See Robinson v. Tyson, 319 S.C. 360,\r\n  366, 461 S.E.2d 397, 400 (Ct.

Hughes (Hughes)\r\n  appeals the grant of summary judgment with regard to her breach of contract\r\n  claim against Oconee County, South Carolina; Bill Rinehart, Marion Lyles, H.\r\n  Frank Ables, Steve Moore and Tommy Crumpton, as Duly Elected Council Members of\r\n  Oconee County Council (collectively â€œCountyâ€).Â  The trial court granted Countyâ€™s\r\n  summary judgment motion based on the doctrine of avoidable consequences.Â  We reverse.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn\r\n  December of 2000, Hughes began working as the Oconee County Supervisor.Â  She\r\n  maintained this position until Governor Mark Sanford suspended her in May 2003,\r\n  after criminal charges were brought against her in Oconee and Pickens Counties for embezzlement and misconduct in office.Â  Hughes remained suspended from\r\n  office until April 2004, when, pursuant to a deal offered by Oconee County, the charges were dismissed.Â  While charges were pending against her in Oconee County, criminal charges were initiated against her in Anderson County for misuse of a\r\n  telephone at Clemson University during her previous employment.Â  Hughes was\r\n  acquitted of the Anderson County charge in February 2005.  \r\nHughes\r\n  signed a new employment contract (Contract) with Oconee County on April 19,\r\n  2004, where she would be retained â€œas a consultant on the Americans with\r\n  Disabilities Act for a period of three (3) years beginning May 1, 2004 and\r\n  ending April 30, 2007.â€ This Contract included health insurance and state\r\n  retirement benefits for her employment term.Â  Additionally, the contract\r\n  stated:\r\n\r\n\tOconee\r\n  County, South Carolina will pay Ann Hamilton Hughes the sum of $50,000 per\r\n  year payable on a bi-weekly basis at the rate of $1,923.08 for the three (3)\r\n  year term.Â  Ann Hamilton Hughes may be terminated for cause for any future\r\n  violation of the laws of the United States, the State of South Carolina or\r\n  ordinances, policies and procedures of Oconee County and is subject to all such\r\n  laws, ordinances, policies and procedures.\r\n\tAs part\r\n  and parcel of the consideration of this contract of employment, Ann Hamilton\r\n  Hughes will execute a general release of liability releasing Oconee County, all County employees and elected officials for any causes of action she might\r\n  have through the date of the release, including past salary and attorney fees\r\n  and costs.\r\n\r\nUnder\r\n  the Contract, Hughesâ€™s duties were to:Â  (1) perform written assessments of all\r\n  County buildings and Oconee County School buildings for compliance with the\r\n  Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); (2) execute such other duties concerning\r\n  the ADA as required by the Chief Administrative Officer of Oconee County; and (3) answer only to the Chief Administrative Officer of Oconee County.Â  In return, the County agreed to pay for any training, travel, lodging and meals with\r\n  connection to training necessary and incident to perform ADA assessments, and\r\n  provide office equipment and materials necessary for the performance of her\r\n  work.\r\nHughes\r\n  submitted her resignation as County Supervisor on April 20, 2004, as well as a\r\n  signed release, which provided:\r\n\r\n\tFOR THE\r\n  SOLE CONSIDERATION of the employment of Ann Hamilton Hughes as a consultant on\r\n  the Americans with Disabilities Act for a period of three (3) years beginning\r\n  May 1, 2004 and ending April 30, 2007 pursuant to a binding contract with\r\n  Oconee County, South Carolina at the sum of $50,000 per year payable on a\r\n  bi-weekly basis at the rate of $1,923.08 for the three (3) year term, the\r\n  receipt and sufficiency whereof is hereby acknowledged, the undersigned hereby\r\n  releases and forever discharges Oconee County, all County employees and elected\r\n  officials for any causes of action Ann Hamilton Hughes might have through the\r\n  date of the release, including past salary and attorney fees and costs, their\r\n  successors, heirs, executors, administrators, agents and assigns, who might be\r\n  liable or who might be claimed to be liable, none of whom admit any liability\r\n  to the undersigned but all expressly deny any liability, from any and all\r\n  claims, demands, damages, actions, causes of action or suits of any kind or\r\n  nature whatsoever, and particularly on account of any injuries, known and\r\n  unknown, both to person and property, which have resulted or may in the future\r\n  develop from the arrest of Ann Hamilton Hughes for which she was found â€œnot\r\n  guiltyâ€ and/or the charges being dismissed, with prejudice.\r\n\tThe\r\n  undersigned hereby declares that the terms of this settlement have been\r\n  completely read and are fully understood and voluntarily accepted for the\r\n  purpose of making a full and final compromise adjustment and settlement of any\r\n  and all claims, disputed or otherwise, on account of the injuries and damages\r\n  above mentioned, and for the express purpose of precluding forever any further\r\n  or additional claims arising out of the aforesaid accident and/or injury.Â  As\r\n  this release relates to employees and elected officials, this release is\r\n  conditioned however, that ALL copies of investigative materials\r\n  collected from Ms. Hughes computer, which could in any way be considered\r\n  personal, will be delivered to her attorneys on or before May 1, 2004.Â  No such\r\n  investigative file in either and/or offices shall be disseminated by either\r\n  entity or individually.Â  In the event any person elected or employed by Oconee County, who has direct or indirect access, disseminates any such personal material,\r\n  Ann Hamilton Hughes may institute civil litigation in this regard and the civil\r\n  release executed by her in consideration for the contract of employment shall\r\n  not be a bar to such action.Â  All limitations of actions are tolled conditioned\r\n  on non-disclosure of personal information and data.\r\n\tThe\r\n  undersigned hereby accepts this three (3) year employment contract as set forth\r\n  herein as full and final settlement for any and all claims and injuries except\r\n  as stated hereinabove.\r\n\r\nIn May 2004, Hughes\r\n  commenced employment as a consultant with Oconee County under the Contract.Â \r\n  Ron Rabun, the Administrator of Oconee County, terminated Hughes on June 2,\r\n  2005, in a letter stating:Â   \r\n\r\n\tAs you\r\n  know, your personnel file as ADA Coordinator contains numerous counseling and\r\n  disciplinary actions addressing performance and attendance issues prior to this\r\n  final action.Â  Therefore, the record will show that progressive disciplinary\r\n  measures have been followed to justify this final action.\r\n\tConsequently,\r\n  your employment with the County will be terminated on Friday, June 3, 2005.\r\n\r\nOn June 3, 2005,\r\n  Hughes filed a complaint alleging:Â  (1) breach of contract; (2) abuse of\r\n  process; (3) guaranty; (4) tortious interference with contractual relations;\r\n  and (5) civil conspiracy.Â  She amended her complaint on June 30, 2005.Â  The\r\n  County filed a motion to dismiss or strike certain portions of Hughesâ€™s\r\n  complaint on August 2, 2005, and filed an answer to the amended complaint on\r\n  September 22, 2005, declaring Hughesâ€™s termination was for cause.\r\nThe trial court\r\n  dismissed Hughesâ€™s guaranty cause of action on September 27, 2005.Â  Hughes\r\n  subsequently voluntarily dismissed all other claims except breach of contract.\r\nThe County moved\r\n  for summary judgment on May 5, 2006, arguing Hughes, in her deposition\r\n  testimony, established she made no efforts to mitigate her damages by seeking\r\n  other employment.Â  Thus, the County contended no dispute existed on the issue\r\n  of Hughesâ€™s efforts to mitigate her damages.Â  At the July 31, 2006, motion\r\n  hearing, the County referred to this relevant portion of Hughesâ€™s deposition:\r\n\r\n\tQ:Â  Let\r\n  me change direction on you again a little bit.Â  What are you doing today?\r\n\tA:Â \r\n  Nothing.\r\n\tQ:Â  What\r\n  I mean by that is, are you employed?\r\n\tA:Â  No.\r\n\tQ:Â  Have\r\n  you sought employment?\r\n\tA:Â  I\r\n  asked about a part-time job and never heard back from them.\r\n\tQ:Â  From\r\n  who?\r\n\tA:Â  At\r\n  the Booksmith in Seneca, Tricia Lightweis.\r\n\tQ:Â  That\r\n  was the Seneca?\r\n\tA:Â  Booksmith.\r\n\tQ:Â \r\n  Booksmith?\r\n\tA:Â \r\n  Uh-huh (affirmative).\r\n\tQ:Â  When\r\n  would you have asked her?\r\n\tA:Â  Oh,\r\n  gosh, shortly after I was terminated.\r\n\tQ:Â  Have\r\n  you sought any other work other than that one position?\r\n\tA:Â  In\r\n  short, no.\r\n\tâ€¦\r\n\tQ:Â  Did\r\n  every occasion that you went out produce a negative reaction?\r\n\tA:Â  I\r\n  tried not to notice.\r\n\tQ:Â  So\r\n  you donâ€™t know, is that what youâ€™re saying?\r\n\tA:Â  No.Â \r\n  What Iâ€™m saying is, I tried to ignore it, the whispers, the glances, and the â€“\r\n  what Iâ€™m trying to say to you is, in essence, this quasi exile of mine is\r\n  self-imposed, yes, but it is â€“ was it something that I sat down and determined\r\n  that I was going to do?Â  No.\r\n\tQ:Â  Was\r\n  there anything that happened within the community, subsequent to the\r\n  termination of your contract, that led you to conclude that this self-imposed\r\n  exile was necessary?\r\n\tA:Â \r\n  Until this happened, until the termination in 2004, I was going out to dinner\r\n  with my husband.Â  I went car shopping.Â  I went to Belkâ€™s.Â  I visited friends,\r\n  from time to time.Â  There were no â€“ itâ€™s impossible for me to tell you how\r\n  often, but it did happen; not as frequently as it did prior to 2003.Â  But I can\r\n  tell you, sitting here in this chair, that June of 2004 I have all but become a\r\n  recluse in my own home.Â  I have made it my own prison.Â  But no, it was not a\r\n  conscious decision, itâ€™s something that has evolved over time.\r\n\tQ:Â  So\r\n  June of 2004?\r\n\tA:Â \r\n  2005, Iâ€™m sorry.\r\n\r\nOn\r\n  August 25, 2006, the trial judge issued his order granting the Countyâ€™s motion\r\n  for summary judgment, reasoning:\r\n\r\n\tIn the\r\n  instant case, Defendants [County] supported their motion to dismiss Plaintiffâ€™s\r\n  [Hughes] claims for lost wages and benefits with Plaintiffâ€™s own deposition\r\n  testimony where in she admitted that she had made virtually no effort to look\r\n  for work subsequent to her termination on June 2, 2005.Â  In the absence of any\r\n  contrary evidence presented by Plaintiff, this testimony clearly establishes\r\n  that Plaintiff did not mitigate her damages and there are no genuine issues of\r\n  fact remaining for trial.Â  Plaintiff failed to present any evidence by way of\r\n  deposition testimony, documents or affidavits indicating that there exists a\r\n  genuine factual dispute related to Plaintiffâ€™s efforts to mitigate her\r\n  damages.Â  While counsel for Plaintiff argued that no one would hire Plaintiff\r\n  or that any attempts by Plaintiff to find work would have been futile, there\r\n  was no evidence in the record on either of these issues.Â  As the arguments of\r\n  counsel are not evidence for purposes of defeating summary judgment (see\r\n\tgenerally, West v. Gladney, 341 S.C. 127, 533 S.E.2d 334, 338\r\n  (Ct. App. 2000)), these arguments are of no avail to Plaintiff.Â  In the absence\r\n  of any such evidence, there are no factual disputes remaining for trial\r\n  relating to Plaintiffâ€™s failure to mitigate her damages, and Defendants Motion\r\n  for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiffâ€™s claim for back pay and benefits is\r\n  hereby granted.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\nDid\r\n  the trial court err in granting the Countyâ€™s summary judgment motion based on\r\n  the doctrine of avoidable consequences?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn\r\n  reviewing the grant of summary judgment, [an appellate court] applies the same\r\n  standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56, SCRP:Â  summary judgment is\r\n  proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving\r\n  party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.â€ Pittman v.

Stone, 160 Va. 381, 168 S.E. 436\r\n  (1933).Â  The evidence provided no basis for the court to hold, as a matter of\r\n  law, that the [plaintiffs] unreasonably failed to mitigate damages.Â  That\r\n  question was properly submitted to the jury.\r\n\r\nConcomitantly, a\r\n  judge may not lower a juryâ€™s award to compensate defendant for plaintiffâ€™s lack\r\n  of vigor to mitigate, as illustrated in McClary:\r\n\r\n\tSince\r\n  McClary was seeking damages of $130,000, it is inferable that the jury\r\n  considered mitigation and declined to award the $17,000 sought for losses\r\n  occurring after 1984.Â  The losses McClary suffered in 1984 were incurred in\r\n  hiring workers to harvest crops he had obligated himself to harvest in 1983.Â \r\n  Massey Ferguson again argues, and the judge apparently agreed, that McClary\r\n  should have mitigated these losses by repairing the combine.Â  As we have\r\n  already observed, whether McClary was under a duty to spend $4,000 to have the\r\n  machine repaired was properly a question for the jury.Â  We hold, therefore, the\r\n  trial judge erred in reducing the damages awarded by the jury.\r\n\r\n291 S.C. at 511, 354 S.E.2d\r\n  at 408.\r\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employment Contracts\r\nâ€œAn employment\r\n  contract may be either for a stated term or at will.â€Â  Young v.

Springs Industries, Inc., 292 S.C. 481, 486, 357 S.E.2d 452, 455\r\n  (1987)).\r\nBaril\r\n  v. Aiken Regional Medical Centers,\r\n  352 S.C. 271, 285, 573 S.E.2d 830, 838 (Ct. App. 2002), an action for breach of\r\n  an employment contract, has striking similarity to the case at bar.Â  In\r\n  examining the appropriateness of summary judgment in Baril, this Court\r\n  explained:\r\n\r\n\tA party\r\n  injured by the acts of another is required to do those things a person of\r\n  ordinary prudence would do under the circumstances, but the law does not\r\n  require him to exert himself unreasonably or incur substantial expense to avoid\r\n  damages.Â  McClary v. Massey Ferguson, Inc., 291 S.C. 506, 354 S.E.2d 405\r\n  (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Whether the party acted reasonably to mitigate damages is\r\n  ordinarily a question for the jury.Â  Id.\r\n\tBaril\r\n  did not seek other employment throughout this litigation.Â  However, she\r\n  attempted to justify her behavior.Â  First, she testified she did not want to\r\n  reveal to potential employers that she had been fired.Â  Second, she testified\r\n  that there were no other hospitals with emergency rooms in or near Aiken, where\r\n  she resided.Â  Thus, she would have been forced to either commute or relocate in\r\n  order to perform similar work.Â  Baril did not want to relocate because she had\r\n  a home and family in Aiken, where she taught college classes on a full-time\r\n  basis.Â  Baril speculated that a lengthy commute would interfere with her\r\n  teaching career.\r\n\tConsidering\r\n  the evidence in the light most favorable to Baril, reasonable minds could\r\n  disagree over whether she made reasonable efforts to mitigate her damages.Â  The\r\n  trial court should have allowed this question to be resolved by a jury.\r\n\r\n5.&nbsp; Application of Doctrine of\r\n  Avoidable Consequences\r\nIn the case at bar,\r\n  Hughes and the County entered into an employment contract for a definite term\r\n  of three (3) years.Â  The Contract included an annual salary of fifty thousand\r\n  dollars ($50,000), health benefits, and retirement benefits.Â  Hughes started working\r\n  and was terminated approximately a year later, with almost two years remaining\r\n  on the Contract.\r\nHughes brought a\r\n  breach of contract action and sought damages.Â  The County raised the doctrine\r\n  of avoidable consequences, averring Hughes was under a duty to make all reasonable\r\n  efforts to minimize her alleged damages.Â  Moreover, the County asserted Hughes\r\n  was not entitled to damages which could have been avoided by reasonable care\r\n  and diligence.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the\r\n  County, holding there were no factual issues left in dispute with regards to\r\n  Hughesâ€™s failure to mitigate damages based on submitted documents, affidavits,\r\n  and Hughesâ€™s deposition.\r\nThe\r\n  doctrine of avoidable consequences imposes a duty on Hughes to act as a\r\n  reasonable, prudent person to mitigate her damages, but she is not required to\r\n  exert herself unreasonably or incur substantial costs.Â  In addition, it\r\n  requires the County to present evidence showing the damages were reasonably avoidable.Â \r\n  Hughes attempts to justify her inaction with her deposition testimony by\r\n  stating she did not seek employment other than the inquiry at Booksmith in\r\n  Seneca because:Â  â€œ[it was] appallingly difficult to go anywhere, to the grocery\r\n  store, to church, to my hairdresserâ€™s, anywhere, out to dinner with my husband,\r\n  to do anything, because of everything that has happened over the past several\r\n  years.â€\r\nIn\r\n  totality, the actions and conduct of Hughes to mitigate her damages must be\r\n  examined in the light of what an ordinary, reasonable and prudent person would\r\n  do under similar circumstances.Â  Indubitably, the evidentiary record mandates\r\n  that the issue of mitigation of damages in this case is a question which should\r\n  have been submitted to the jury.Â   \r\nA priori, an issue\r\n  exists as to the identification of damages, i.e., accrued, prospective, and\r\n  present.Â  This case involves a contract for a specified term.Â  Two (2) years\r\n  existed or remained in the contract term after the date of Hughesâ€™s\r\n  termination.Â  Hughes asserts that a potpourri of damages should be presented to\r\n  the jury inclusive of:Â  (1) accrued damages, (2) prospective damages, and (3)\r\n  present damages.Â  Importantly, the summary judgment was heard on July 31, 2006,\r\n  and the evidence relied upon by the circuit court in concluding Hughes had not\r\n  done enough to mitigate her damages was developed in February 2006.Â  At that\r\n  time, Hughes had an additional nine (9) months left in the employment term,\r\n  within which she could have made additional efforts at seeking employment.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  rule there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether Hughes acted\r\n  reasonably in mitigating her damages.Â  The trial court erred in granting the\r\n  Countyâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  We hold the evidentiary record prohibits\r\n  the grant of summary judgment based upon the doctrine of mitigation of damages\r\n  and/or the doctrine of avoidable consequences.Â   \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s decision is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nANDERSON and THOMAS, JJ.,\r\n  and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-462","title":"Black v.

Black (Dean) sought the\r\n  partition of a parcel of land owned as tenants in common with\r\n  Appellant/Respondent C. Raymond Black (Raymond).Â  A Board of Commissioners,\r\n  formed by agreement of the parties, examined the parcel and issued a report\r\n  determining it could be partitioned in kind.Â  The trial court approved the report\r\n  and ordered partition.Â  Both parties filed objections. Â Â We affirm.[1]\r\nFacts\r\nOn November 20,\r\n  2003, Dean E. Black brought this action seeking the partition and sale of a 57\r\n  acre parcel of land he and his brother, C. Raymond Black, owned as tenants in\r\n  common.Â  Raymond denied Deanâ€™s assertion that the property could not be\r\n  partitioned in kind.Â  Raymond counterclaimed for specific performance of an\r\n  agreement he alleged Dean had made to sell Raymond his interest.Â  Raymond\r\n  additionally counterclaimed for the court to issue a writ of partition, appoint\r\n  commissioners, and divide the property in kind or, if the property could not be\r\n  divided in kind, to sell the property to Raymond.Â   \r\nA\r\n  July 27, 2004 hearing on the matter ended with a grant of continuance for\r\n  Raymond, but the parties met in chambers for a status conference.Â  They were\r\n  instructed that the court usually orders partition in kind in cases involving\r\n  acreage and, if the parties cannot agree on a division, a Board of\r\n  Commissioners is appointed to effectuate the partition.Â  The parties then\r\n  produced an aerial photograph of the land marked with a recommended division\r\n  line.Â  The proposal allowed Raymond to receive the portion nearest his home on\r\n  a lot he owned.Â  Although Raymond initially agreed to this solution, he\r\n  withdrew his approval when informed the court could not prohibit Dean from\r\n  developing his portion of the acreage.Â   \r\nAt\r\n  a November 2004 hearing, the parties again advised the court they had reached\r\n  an agreement.Â  On December 29, 2004, a consent order was signed.Â  Pursuant to\r\n  the agreement and order, a Board of Commissioners (the Board) was formed to\r\n  determine whether the property could be partitioned in kind. Â Dean and Raymond each\r\n  named a surveyor and an appraiser to the Board, and the court named a chairperson.Â \r\n  The agreement laid out numerous factors the Board was to consider in dividing\r\n  the land into parcels of equal monetary value. The factors included a power\r\n  line right-of-way and a boundary dispute with adjoining property owners. Â Dean would\r\n  be awarded the parcel on Mud Creek Road (Tract A) and Raymond would receive the\r\n  parcel fronting on Cedar Lane (Tract B).Â  Mutual restraining orders prohibited\r\n  the parties from interfering with each other and with the appraisers and\r\n  surveyors.Â  The parties would divide all costs of the Board.Â  Raymond was\r\n  required to erect a fence to maintain his animals.Â  The parties would equally\r\n  divide the 2003 and 2004 taxes which Dean had already paid.Â  Raymond asked for\r\n  a 100 foot wide buffer between an adjacent lot he already owned and the parcel\r\n  awarded to Dean.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  Board issued its report finding partition in kind was feasible and Raymond\r\n  filed several objections.Â  On July 22, 2005, a final hearing was held to\r\n  consider the objections and for the court to issue its final order accepting or\r\n  modifying the Boardâ€™s report.Â  Raymond was absent from the hearing though his\r\n  wife appeared and testified to his objections.Â  Dean entered his objections by\r\n  testimony at this hearing.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  court approved the Boardâ€™s report that the property could be partitioned in\r\n  kind.Â  In its order, the court stated the commissionersâ€™ fees were high but the\r\n  situation required competent professionals.Â  The court found the Board was\r\n  careful and professional in their performance, but that Raymond had not\r\n  cooperated with their attempts to enter the propertyâ€™s buildings for\r\n  inspection.Â  The trial court opined that Raymond could not now complain of the\r\n  alleged deficiencies in the report caused by his own willful behavior.Â  Finally,\r\n  the court noted the report was similar to the resolution discussed by the\r\n  parties at the July 27, 2004 status conference.Â  While observing that division\r\n  would produce a result less than exact, the judge determined any resulting\r\n  difference was insignificant.Â   \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Raymond asserted the Boardâ€™s report erroneously calculated the acreage\r\n  encumbered by the power line right-of-way on Tract B.Â  He argued the buildings\r\n  on Tract B, appraised at $13,000.00 in the report, were without value.Â  Raymond\r\n  alleged the trial court should have required the commissioners to personally\r\n  inspect the buildings before accepting their valuation.Â  Raymond argued the trial\r\n  court erred in ordering the parties to pay the Boardâ€™s fees without giving the\r\n  parties an opportunity to be heard and without first finding the fees\r\n  reasonable.\r\nDean\r\n  argued the trial court erred in ordering partition in kind rather than ordering\r\n  a public sale or partition by allotment vesting him with the property.Â  He\r\n  alleged Raymondâ€™s conduct rendered the procedure unfair and caused him injury.Â \r\n  Dean complained the court erred in failing to consider partition by allotment\r\n  and erred in refusing to hold Raymond in contempt for his failure to appear at\r\n  the July 22, 2005 hearing.\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nA\r\n  partition action is an equitable action and this Court may review the evidence\r\n  to determine facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence. Zimmerman v. Marsh, 365 S.C. 383, 386, 618 S.E.2d 898, 900\r\n  (2005); Anderson v. Anderson, 299 S.C. 110, 382 S.E.2d 897 (1989); Doe v. Roe, 323 S.C. 445, 475\r\n  S.E.2d 783 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not\r\n  require this court to disregard the findings at trial or ignore the fact that\r\n  the trial judge was in a better position to assess the credibility of the witnesses.Â  Laughon\r\n    v. Oâ€™Braitis, 360 SC 520, 524-25, 602 S.E.2d 108, 110 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004); Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller,\r\n  324 S.C. 445, 477 S.E.2d 476 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The partition\r\n  action must be fair and equitable to all parties.Â  Zimmerman, 365 S.C.\r\n  at 386, 618 S.E.2d at 900; Pruitt v. Pruitt, 298 S.C. 411, 380 S.E.2d\r\n  862 (Ct. App. 1989).Â   \r\nDiscussion\r\nWhen\r\n  the court determines a partition cannot be fairly and equally made, the court\r\n  may order a sale of the property and a division of the proceeds according to\r\n  the rights of the parties.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-61-100 (2005); Zimmerman,\r\n  365 S.C. at 386, 618 S.E.2d at 900; see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-61-50\r\n  (2005) (if partition in kind or by allotment cannot be fairly and impartially\r\n  made and without injury to any of the parties in interest, then the court of\r\n  common pleas has jurisdiction to order sale of the property and the division of\r\n  the proceeds according to the partiesâ€™ rights). Rule 71(f)(4), SCRCP,Â  instructs:\r\n\r\n\tIf it shall appear to the court that it\r\n  will be for the benefit of all parties interested in the . . . property that it\r\n  should be vested in one or more of the persons entitled to a portion of it, . .\r\n  . the person or persons, on the payment of the consideration money, shall be\r\n  vested with the [property]. But if it shall appear to the court that it would\r\n  be more for the interest of the parties interested in the . . . property that\r\n  it should be sold and the proceeds of sale be divided among them, then the\r\n  court shall direct a sale to be made upon such terms as the court shall deem\r\n  right.\r\n\r\nOur\r\n  supreme court has previously held that partition in kind is favored when it can\r\n  be fairly made without injury to the parties.Â  Anderson v. Anderson,\r\n  299 S.C. 110, 114, 382 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1989); Smith v. Pearson, 210\r\n  S.C. 524, 43 S.E.2d 479 (1947); see also Cox v. Frierson, 315\r\n  S.C. 469, 451 S.E.2d 392 (1994) (partition in kind is statutorily preferred\r\n  over judicial sale of the property).Â  Our supreme courtâ€™s decision in Few v.\r\n    Few, 242 S.C. 433, 131 S.E.2d 248 (1963), holding that in kind partitions\r\n  are appropriate only where they can be made fairly and without injury to the\r\n  parties, did not alter the statutory preference for in kind partition.\r\nA.&nbsp; Appellant/Respondentâ€™s\r\n  Appeal\r\nRaymond\r\n  argues the court erred in accepting the Boardâ€™s report due to its erroneous measurement\r\n  of the power line right-of-way and the valuation of Tract Bâ€™s buildings.Â  â€œThere\r\n  is a cardinal principle of law that a trial court should not reject the return\r\n  of a majority of the commissioners unless the division is clearly shown to be\r\n  erroneous, unfair, unjust and inequitable.â€Â  Wilson v. McGuire,\r\n  320 S.C. 137, 142, 463 S.E.2d 614, 617 (Ct. App. 1995); see also Parrot\r\n    v. Barrett, 81 S.C. 255, 260, 62 S.E. 241, 242 (1908) (to overthrow\r\n  valuation made by the commissioners in partition, it must be shown that it is\r\n  so grossly incorrect and unequal as to justify an inference that the\r\n  commissioners acted from an unfair and improper motive); Aldrich v. Aldrich,\r\n  75 S.C. 369, 369, 55 S.E. 887, 888 (1906) (the return of commissioners in the\r\n  division of land on writ of partition will be supported by the court unless\r\n  clearly shown to be erroneous and unjust).Â   \r\nRaymond\r\n  contended the Board erred in finding the power line right-of-way affected\r\n  approximately two acres rather than five acres as recorded in the appraisal.Â  However,\r\n  he failed to challenge the report with clear evidence of the right-of-wayâ€™s\r\n  size.Â  At the final hearing, which Raymond did not attend, his wife testified\r\n  about the location of the right-of-way though her testimony was unclear. When\r\n  considering the right-of-way, the Board found that the flood plain on Tract A\r\n  covered approximately the same area.Â  Accordingly, the Board made no adjustments.Â \r\n \r\nRaymondâ€™s\r\n  argument that the buildings on Tract B were valueless and that the trial court\r\n  should have ordered them personally inspected is without merit.Â  The record\r\n  indicates Raymond eluded his own lawyer and the inspectors as they sought entry\r\n  to the property.Â  Raymondâ€™s wife admitted they used the buildings to keep\r\n  horses and to store personal effects and farming equipment.Â  Importantly, the\r\n  trial judge found Raymond was not cooperative in allowing the inspectors access\r\n  and stated Raymond could not complain of alleged deficiencies brought about by\r\n  his own willful conduct. Â We find Raymond has failed to clearly show the\r\n  Boardâ€™s report was erroneous, unfair, unjust and inequitable, and this Court\r\n  will not override the findings of the report or its adoption by the trial\r\n  court.\r\nRaymond\r\n  argued the court erred in ordering the parties to pay the Boardâ€™s fees without\r\n  first giving the parties an opportunity to be heard and without determining the\r\n  feesâ€™ reasonableness.Â  Prior to this appeal, the only issue raised concerning\r\n  the fees was the request made by the defense at the final hearing for an\r\n  extension of the payment deadline.Â  â€œIt is well settled that an issue cannot be\r\n  raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled\r\n  upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.â€Â  Staubes v.\r\n    City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000); see\r\n      also Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 422, 526\r\n  S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000) (â€œImposing this preservation requirement on the\r\n  appellant is meant to enable the lower court to rule properly after it has\r\n  considered all relevant facts, law, and arguments.â€); Ellie Inc. v. Miccichi,\r\n  358 S.C. 78, 103, 594 S.E.2d 485, 498 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œWithout an initial\r\n  ruling by the trial court, a reviewing court simply would not be able to\r\n  evaluate whether the trial court committed error.â€).Â  Therefore, this issue is\r\n  not preserved for our review.Â   \r\nB.&nbsp; Respondent/Appellantâ€™s\r\n  Appeal\r\nAlthough\r\n  Deanâ€™s first complaint initiating this litigation prayed for partition and\r\n  sale, Dean and Raymond later presented the trial court with their agreement to\r\n  partition in kind.Â  Dean further requested at the final hearing that the parcel\r\n  be partitioned in kind and the court complied.Â  Reasoning that Raymondâ€™s\r\n  behavior rendered partition in kind unfair, Dean reasserted partition and sale\r\n  as a theory of relief in his Motion for Reconsideration and included the\r\n  argument in this appeal. This Court acknowledges an issue raised but not ruled\r\n  upon by the trial court may nonetheless be preserved when the complaining party\r\n  moves to amend judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP. Â Wilder Corp. v.\r\n    Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 77, 497 S.E.2d 731, 734 (1998); Talley v. South Carolina Higher Educ. Tuition Grants Comm., 289 S.C. 483, 347 S.E.2d 99 (1986); Bailey\r\n      v. Segars, 346 S.C. 359, 550 S.E.2d 910 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  However, we find\r\n  Dean is bound by his agreement embodied in the trial courtâ€™s consent order.Â  In Johnson v. Johnson, 310 S.C. 44, 425 S.E.2d 46 (Ct. App. 1992), this Court\r\n  held:\r\n\r\n\tOrdinarily,\r\n  where a judgment or order is entered by consent, it is binding and conclusive\r\n  and cannot be attacked by the parties either by direct appeal or in a\r\n  collateral proceeding. However, a consent order is an agreement of the parties, under the sanction of the\r\n  court, and is to be interpreted as an agreement.Â  It can be rescinded by mutual\r\n  consent in a subsequent court action. \r\n\r\nId. at 46-47, 425\r\n  S.E.2d at 48 (citations omitted).Â  Although the consent order in Johnson was set aside based on Rule 60(b), SCRCP, the agreement in the case at bar\r\n  provided that any violations of the terms be punishable by citation or\r\n  contempt.Â  Moreover, this Court has recognized that a party cannot complain\r\n  when it receives the relief it requested.Â  McKissick v.

App.\r\n  2005) (a party cannot for the first time raise an issue by way of a Rule 59(e)\r\n  motion which could have been raised at trial).Â  Accordingly, this issue has not\r\n  been preserved for our review.\r\nAlthough\r\n  Dean did not move for contempt at the July 22, 2005 final hearing, he contends\r\n  the trial court erred in not finding Raymond in contempt for his absence. â€œThe\r\n  power to punish for contempt is inherent in all courts\r\n  and is essential to preservation of order in judicial proceedings.â€ Browning\r\n    v. Browning, 366 S.C. 255, 263, 621 S.E.2d 389, 392 (Ct. App. 2005) (quoting In re Brown, 333 S.C. 414, 420, 511 S.E.2d 351, 355 (1989)). â€œOn appeal,\r\n  a decision regarding contempt should be reversed only if\r\n  it is without evidentiary support or the trial judge has abused his discretion.â€Â  Stone v. Reddix-Smalls, 295 S.C. 514, 516, 369\r\n  S.E.2d 840, 840 (1988) (citations omitted); Lukich v. Lukich, 368 S.C.\r\n  47, 627 S.E.2d 754 (Ct.

Â§ 20-7-1350 (Supp.\r\n  2006) (A party may be found in contempt of court for the\r\n  willful violation of a lawful court order.).Â  â€œA\r\n  determination of contempt is a serious matter and should\r\n  be imposed sparingly; whether it is or is not imposed is within the discretion of the trial judge, which will not be disturbed on appeal\r\n  unless it is without evidentiary support.â€Â  Haselwood v. Sullivan, 283\r\n  S.C. 29, 32-33, 320 S.E.2d 499, 501 (Ct. App. 1984) (citing Hicks v. Hicks,\r\n  280 S.C. 378, 312 S.E.2d 598 (Ct.

Hudgins, of Columbia, for\r\n  Appellant\r\n\t\t\t\tJohn Benjamin Aplin, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  Willie Michael Moore appeals\r\n  the revocation of his community supervision.Â  Moore argues the trial court\r\n  erred in not specifically finding that his failure to comply with the\r\n  requirements of home detention was willful.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn May 2, 2002, Moore was convicted of second degree arson and\r\n  sentenced to ten years imprisonment, suspended upon the service of ninety days\r\n  imprisonment and three years probation.Â  On February 13, 2003, the court\r\n  revoked Mooreâ€™s probation, reinstated three years of his suspended sentence,\r\n  and terminated his probation.Â  Moore was placed in the South Carolina\r\n  Department of Probation, Parole, and Pardon Servicesâ€™ (the Departmentâ€™s)\r\n  community supervision program (Program).\r\nOn\r\n  August 3, 2005, Moore appeared before the court for a community supervision\r\n  violation hearing.Â  The trial judge found Moore had willfully violated the\r\n  terms of the Program but continued him in the Program.Â  On October 5, 2005, an\r\n  arrest warrant was issued for Moore based on his alleged violations of the\r\n  terms of the Program.Â  Specifically, the arrest warrant charged Moore with having failed to follow the advice and instructions of his agent, by confessing\r\n  to having used cocaine subsequent to a failed drug test, by failing to pay $140\r\n  in supervision fees, and by violating the home detention provision of the\r\n  Program.\r\nOn\r\n  October 26, 2005, Moore appeared before the trial court for another community\r\n  supervision violation hearing.Â  Mooreâ€™s counsel argued the State had not\r\n  complied with the home detention provision of his probation.Â  The trial court\r\n  revoked Mooreâ€™s community supervision and imposed a sentence of one year for\r\n  violating the Program.Â  Moore appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMoore argues his\r\n  alleged violation of home detention was not willful because home detention was\r\n  not imposed as part of the Program.Â  As such, Moore contends the violation of home\r\n  detention cannot serve as a ground upon which his community supervision could\r\n  be revoked.Â  We affirm.\r\nGenerally â€œa â€˜no\r\n  parole offenseâ€™ as defined in Section 24-13-100 must include . . . completion\r\n  of a community supervision program . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-560(A)\r\n  (2007).Â  â€œThe period of time a prisoner is required to participate in a\r\n  community supervision program and the individual terms and conditions of a\r\n  prisonerâ€™s participation shall be at the discretion of the department based\r\n  upon guidelines developed by the director.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-560(B)\r\n  (2007).\r\nâ€œIf\r\n  the department determines that a prisoner has violated a term of the community\r\n  supervision program and the community supervision should be revoked, a\r\n  probation agent must initiate a proceeding in General Sessions Court.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œIf the court determines that a prisoner has wilfully violated a term or\r\n  condition of the community supervision program, the court may impose any other\r\n  terms or conditions considered appropriate and may continue the prisoner on\r\n  community supervision, or the court may revoke the prisonerâ€™s community\r\n  supervision and impose a sentence of up to one year for violation of the\r\n  community supervision program.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-560(C) (2007).\r\nIn Jackson v.\r\n  State, 349 S.C. 62, 64, 562 S.E.2d 475, 475 (2002), our supreme court held\r\n  â€œthe Program serves essentially the same function for persons convicted of â€˜no\r\n  parole offensesâ€™ as parole does for other inmates.â€Â  â€œProbation is\r\n  judicially-imposed at the time of sentencing: whether a violation of\r\n  probationary terms has occurred, and if so, the consequences of such a\r\n  violation, are matters for the courts.â€Â  Duckson v. State, 355 S.C. 596,\r\n  598, 586 S.E.2d 576, 578 (2003).Â  â€œOn the other hand, the Board of Probation,\r\n  Parole, and Pardon Services determines both parole eligibility and\r\n  revocations.â€Â  Id.\r\nâ€œThis Court will not disturb the Circuit Courtâ€™s\r\n  decision to revoke probation unless the decision was influenced by an error of\r\n  law, was without evidentiary support, or constituted an abuse of discretion.â€Â  State\r\n    v. Lee, 350 S.C. 125, 129, 564 S.E.2d 372, 374 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œProbation\r\n  is a matter of grace; revocation is the means to enforce the conditions of\r\n  probation.â€Â  State v. Hamilton, 333 S.C. 642, 648, 511 S.E.2d 94, 97\r\n  (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œ[B]efore revoking probation, the circuit judge must\r\n  determine if there is sufficient\r\n  evidence to establish that the probationer has violated his probation\r\n  conditions.â€Â  Id.\r\nIn\r\n  the order revoking Mooreâ€™s Program, the judge specifically found Moore â€œwillfully violated termsâ€ of the Program.Â  The order does not specifically address which of\r\n  the alleged violations the court determined Moore committed willfully, however\r\n  section 24-21-560(C) does not require the trial court to make such a finding.Â \r\n  Assuming arguendo that Mooreâ€™s violation of home detention was not\r\n  willful, the record indicates Moore did not attempt to deny or explain the\r\n  other allegations against him at the violation hearing, including his failed\r\n  drug test and subsequent admission to his probation agent that he used cocaine.Â \r\n  We therefore find there is a sufficient factual basis to support the judgeâ€™s\r\n  finding that Moore willfully violated at least one of the terms of his\r\n  community supervised program.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and THOMAS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-487","title":"State v.

Arnold,\r\n  287 S.C. 584, 586, 340 S.E.2d 535, 537 (1986).Â  â€œIn an action at law, tried\r\n  without a jury, the appellate courtâ€™s standard of review extends only to the\r\n  correction of errors of law.â€ Â Temple v. Tec-Fab, Inc., 370 S.C.\r\n  383, 387, 635 S.E.2d 541, 543 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Furthermore, the findings of\r\n  fact of the trial court will not be disturbed on appeal unless found to be\r\n  without evidence reasonably supporting them. Â Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City\r\n    of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants argue\r\n  the award of $6,144.00 as just compensation for the condemnation of their land\r\n  was insufficient.Â  Â Specifically, they contend that the Master erred in failing\r\n  to consider the condemned tract is one of four contiguous tracts that they own\r\n  and that, for purposes of determining just compensation, all four tracts should\r\n  have been considered as a single parcel for the â€œtotal bundle of rightsâ€ that\r\n  would have been lost as a result of the easement.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA\r\n  condemnor may commence an action . . . for the acquisition of an interest in\r\n  any real property necessary for any public purpose.â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 28-2-60\r\n  (2007). Â â€œDetermination of fair market\r\n  value is a question of fact.â€ Â Payne v. Holiday Towers, Inc., 283 S.C.\r\n  210, 215, 321 S.E.2d 179, 182 (Ct. App. 1984).Â   \r\nDuring\r\n  the hearing before the Master, Gary Pruitt testified for CPW as an expert in\r\n  the field of real estate appraisal. Â Appellants did not object to Pruitt as an\r\n  expert, and they neither moved to strike any portion of his testimony nor objected\r\n  to the introduction of the appraisal he performed for CPW.\r\nIn\r\n  determining the fair market value of the parent tract, Pruitt relied on the\r\n  selling price values of four similarly situated tracts of land as comparables.Â \r\n  These tracts were selected by Pruitt according to their frontage on a\r\n  â€œsecondary roadâ€ akin to the road on which the parent tract fronted. Â Based on\r\n  these comparables, all of which were sold within four years of the appraisal in\r\n  question, Pruitt determined the parent tract was worth $10.00 per square foot. Â On\r\n  cross-examination, Pruitt admitted any comparable property that was sold in\r\n  closer proximity to the time of the appraisal would reasonably be considered a\r\n  better indication of the true value of the parent tract. Â Furthermore,\r\n  Appellants questioned Pruitt about the sale of one neighboring tract of land\r\n  that was sold within four weeks after the date of the appraisal and a second,\r\n  adjoining tract of land that fronted on a primary road and was sold within four\r\n  months after the appraisal.Â  Both of these sales supported a higher valuation\r\n  of the parent tract. Â \r\nIn\r\n  explaining how he arrived at his value, Pruitt testified the common practice in\r\n  the appraisal field was to assign a â€œpercentage of encumbrance factorâ€ in determining\r\n  the fair market value of an easement that does not rise to the level of a total\r\n  condemnation.Â  Admitting the lack of a particular formula to determine this\r\n  factor, Pruitt testified he examined the â€œbundle of rightsâ€ held by Appellants,\r\n  as compared to the amount of that bundle Appellants would be forced to\r\n  relinquish because of the easement.Â  Based on this analysis and his previous\r\n  experience as an appraiser, Pruitt determined Appellantsâ€™ loss from the\r\n  easement resulted in a twenty-percent reduction in the fee simple value of their\r\n  land.Â  Â Â \r\nNeither\r\n  party disputes that the amount of land affected by the condemned easement is\r\n  1,920 square feet.Â  Although in his appraisal Pruitt relied on the original\r\n  estimate provided by CPW of 1,845 square feet, he admitted the final plat, which\r\n  listed the square footage at 1,920, accurately reflected the amount of land\r\n  affected by the easement. Â \r\nAppellant\r\n  Mary Alice Foreman Jackson was the only witness testifying on behalf of\r\n  Appellants. Â Jackson testified she and her eight living siblings had inherited\r\n  the four tracts of land, including the parent tract, from their parents and, as\r\n  of the time of the hearing, the property was still divided into four separate\r\n  tracts.Â  Jackson further testified regarding certain conversations Appellants\r\n  had over the years regarding the tracts. Â In those discussions, Appellants discussed\r\n  retaining the property once they inherited it and eventually developing it into\r\n  some form of commercial business.Â  Appellants put forth no evidence of\r\n  preparations to merge or re-zone the property, but they nevertheless suggest\r\n  the Master should have based the award of damages on their privately discussed\r\n  plans.Â Â   \r\nJackson opined the fair market value of the water and sewer\r\n  easement across the parent tract was approximately $39,000.00 to $45,000.00.Â  In\r\n  order to arrive at this figure, Jackson relied on the comparables from Pruittâ€™s\r\n  appraisal, advice of Appellantsâ€™ counsel, and her knowledge of the general\r\n  housing trends and prices in the Mount Pleasant area.Â   \r\nIt\r\n  is a general rule in South Carolina that a landowner is â€œqualified by\r\n  the fact of ownership to give his or her estimate\r\n  of the value of damaged real and personal property.â€ Â Hawkins\r\n    v. Greenwood Dev. Corp., 328 S.C. 585, 594-95, 493 S.E.2d 875, 880 (Ct. App.\r\n  1997).Â  Jacksonâ€™s estimate, however, is speculative conjecture as the tracts\r\n  have not been merged and the property is still zoned residential.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  although the parent tract was zoned for residential purposes at the time of the\r\n  hearing, Pruitt assumed the zoning of the parent tract would be changed to\r\n  commercial for the purposes of the â€œhighest and best useâ€ analysis in his\r\n  appraisal.Â   \r\nTo\r\n  determine just compensation,\r\n  â€œonly the value of the property to be taken, any\r\n  diminution in the value of the landownerâ€™s remaining property,\r\n  and any benefits as provided in Â§ 28-2-360 may be considered.â€ Â S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 28-2-370 (2007).[2] Â Â The landowner, however, is entitled to the value of the\r\n  property under its most advantageous or profitable use, including any use\r\n  reasonably anticipated in the near future. Â City of N. Charleston v. Claxton, 315 S.C. 56, 61, 431 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  In the final order, the Master did not rely entirely\r\n  on the Pruittâ€™s valuation, but instead found the price per square foot\r\n  attributable to the subsequent sale of the adjoining tract as â€œmore pertinent\r\n  in determining the value of the subject property as of the date of the\r\n  condemnation.â€Â  At $16.47, the price per square foot of the adjoining tract was\r\n  sold for over $6.00 more per square foot than the figure that Pruitt\r\n  recommended in his appraisal.Â  Accordingly, the Master used a comparable price\r\n  per square foot of $16.00, for the determined easement area of 1,920 square\r\n  feet, and applied an encumbrance factor of twenty percent to arrive at its\r\n  determination of the fair market value of $6,144.00 for the condemnation of the\r\n  property for the water and sewer easement.Â  Because\r\n  evidence in the record supports this valuation, we affirm the Masterâ€™s award of\r\n  just compensation.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and\r\n  THOMAS, JJ., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Section 28-2-360, which is referenced in section\r\n  28-2-370, provides that â€œ[i]n in any condemnation action, benefits to be\r\n  derived from the proposed project including the value of any property or rights\r\n  relinquished or reverting to the landowner as part of result thereof, must be\r\n  taken into consideration in determining the amount of compensation and due\r\n  allowance made for them.â€Â  S.C.

Cottingham, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-496\r\n  Submitted October 1, 2007 â€“ Filed October\r\n  16, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Appellate Defender Katherine H. Hudgins, of Columbia and Douglas\r\n          Jennings, Jr., of Bennettsville, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney\r\n          General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant\r\n          Attorney General Shawn L. Reeves, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Jay E. Hodge,\r\n          Jr., of Cheraw, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In July\r\n  2005, Anthony Douglas was tried and convicted by a Marlboro County jury of distribution of crack cocaine. Douglas timely appeals this conviction contending\r\n  he was deprived of his right to a fair trial due to a police officerâ€™s\r\n  testimony regarding prior drug purchases from Douglas, the solicitorâ€™s closing\r\n  argument remarks on physical evidence not introduced to the jury, and the solicitorâ€™s\r\n  comment upon the pervasiveness of drugs in Marlboro County during his closing\r\n  argument.Â  Douglas argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for\r\n  mistrial on these three grounds.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn\r\n  March 2004, Robert Candrilli (Candrilli), a confidential informant, planned and\r\n  executed a drug purchase under the auspices of the Marlboro County Sheriffâ€™s\r\n  Department. Candrilli met Officers George McLeod (Officer McLeod) and Robert\r\n  Bryant (Officer Bryant) in a secluded area where the officers searched him for\r\n  drugs and money before attaching a â€œwireâ€ or listening device to Candrilli.\r\n  Candrilli proceeded to the Crossroads Grocery where he used a payphone to call Douglasâ€™s cell-phone and request twenty dollars worth of crack cocaine. Douglas arrived ten\r\n  minutes later in a burgundy Buick, gave Candrilli a substance later determined\r\n  to be .15 grams of crack cocaine, collected twenty dollars, and drove away from\r\n  the pay phone booth. \r\nAs\r\n  Douglas drove away from Candrilli, Douglas passed by Officer McLeod who was\r\n  parked on a dirt road a few hundred yards from Crossroads Grocery. Â While\r\n  Officer McLeod could not see the actual exchange of drugs for money, he could\r\n  identify Douglas as the driver of the passing burgundy Buick. \r\nImmediately\r\n  after the drug transaction, Officer Bryant collected Candrilli from Crossroads\r\n  Grocery and drove him to a secluded location where they met Officer McLeod.\r\n  Candrilli surrendered the crack he had purchased from Douglas and was searched\r\n  again by the officers. Â Douglas was arrested several weeks later and\r\n  indicted for distribution of crack cocaine. Â \r\nDuring\r\n  pre-trial motions the trial court ruled that all testimony should be limited to\r\n  the events of March 15, 2004, and witnesses should refrain from discussing Douglasâ€™s prior drug convictions. Upon cross-examination, Officer McLeod testified he was\r\n  able to identify Douglas as the driver of the burgundy Buick because the\r\n  Marlboro County Sheriffâ€™s Department had previously purchased drugs from Douglas. The trial court immediately gave curative instructions that the jury was to\r\n  disregard any testimony regarding any activity of any kind other than the\r\n  events on March 15. The trial court admonished the jury that should they choose\r\n  to accept Officer McLeodâ€™s testimony, it was to be used for identification\r\n  purposes only. Â \r\nThe\r\n  jury heard testimony from Candrilli regarding the date of the drug transaction,\r\n  Douglasâ€™s cell phone number, and the pay phone number at Crossroads Grocery. Â Candrilli\r\n  recited the date and the phone numbers from a slip of paper he possessed on the\r\n  witness stand. Â During cross-examination Candrilli stated he wrote the\r\n  date and time of the drug transaction on the paper but other people had written\r\n  down the numbers for Douglasâ€™s cell phone and the pay phone at Crossroads\r\n  Grocery. Candrilli testified the paper was from his day-timer, however, during\r\n  closing arguments the solicitor matched the paper to his legal pad. The\r\n  solicitor further explained that he wrote down the phone numbers so Candrilli\r\n  could refresh his memory on the witness stand. \r\nIn\r\n  his closing argument the solicitor also commented upon the pervading nature of\r\n  drugs in Marlboro County schools and areas around Marlboro County. He continued to say that if Douglas were found guilty, the jury would â€œbe doing this\r\n  community and this society a wonderful, wonderful favor by taking a drug dealer\r\n  off of the streets.â€ Â After the solicitor finished his closing argument,\r\n  Douglasâ€™s counsel waited until the jury had been charged before making a\r\n  motion for mistrial based on the solicitorâ€™s closing. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe decision to grant or deny a mistrial is\r\n  within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be overturned on\r\n  appeal absent an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law. State v.\r\n    Stanley, 365 S.C. 24, 33, 615 S.E.2d 455, 460 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  â€œA mistrial should only be granted when â€œabsolutely\r\n  necessary,â€ and a defendant must show both error and resulting prejudice in\r\n  order to be entitled to a mistrial.â€ Id.Â  The granting of a motion for\r\n  mistrial is an extreme measure which should be taken only where an incident is\r\n  so grievous that its prejudicial effect can be removed no other way. Id.Â  Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nDouglas\r\n  argues the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion for mistrial based\r\n  on the following three events during his trial: (1) Officer McLeodâ€™s testimony\r\n  on cross-examination regarding Douglasâ€™s prior involvement in drug transactions\r\n  other than the March 15, 2004 transaction at issue; (2) the solicitorâ€™s closing\r\n  argument discussion of a slip of paper the confidential informant used to\r\n  recall phone numbers and dates while on the witness stand; and (3) the\r\n  solicitorâ€™s closing argument remarks on the universal problem of drugs and the\r\n  presence of drugs in Marlboro County. We disagree.\r\nI. Officerâ€™s Testimony\r\nDuring\r\n  cross-examination of Officer McLeod, Douglasâ€™s counsel inquired as to how\r\n  Officer McLeod could look into a vehicle approaching from the direction of the\r\n  Crossroads Grocery and identify the driver. Officer McLeod warned Douglasâ€™s\r\n  counsel he may not like the answer and when Douglasâ€™s counsel pressed him,\r\n  Officer McLeod testified that he could, â€œidentify [the defendant] because that\r\n  was not the first time the Marlboro County Sherriffâ€™s Office had purchased\r\n  drugs from [the] defendant.â€ Douglas argues this testimony should have resulted\r\n  in a mistrial.Â  We disagree.\r\nEvidence of a defendant's crimes, wrongs, or acts is generally not\r\n  admissible. Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â  Our courts view a defendant's previous\r\n  distribution of drugs as a past bad act. State v. King,\r\n  349 S.C. 142, 152, 561 S.E.2d 640, 645 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  In State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923),\r\n  and incorporated in Rule 404(b), SCRE, a defendant's prior bad acts may be\r\n  admitted to show: (1) motive; (2) identity; (3) the existence of a common\r\n  scheme or plan; (4) the absence of mistake or accident; or (5) intent.\r\nPursuant to Rule 403, SCRE, any prejudice resulting from the\r\n  admission of evidence under Rule 404(b), SCRE, must be outweighed by its\r\n  probative value. Â State v. Fletcher, 363 S.C. 221, 242, 609 S.E.2d 572,\r\n  583 (Ct. App. 2005). â€œThe determination of prejudice must be based on the\r\n  entire record and the result will generally turn on the facts of each case.â€ Id.Â  Generally, a curative\r\n  instruction to disregard testimony or evidence is deemed to have cured any\r\n  alleged error. State v. Walker, 366 S.C. 643, 658, 623 S.E.2d 122, 129-30\r\n  (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nIn\r\n  this case, Douglasâ€™s prior drug transactions were introduced to explain how\r\n  Officer McLeod knew Douglas was the driver of the vehicle.Â  Douglasâ€™s counsel attempted\r\n  to discredit the eyewitnessesâ€™ testimony by arguing that Douglas drives a white\r\n  Mitsubishi sedan and a black Honda Accord, not a burgundy Buick. Â In response\r\n  to the challenges regarding the Buick driverâ€™s identity, Officer McLeod\r\n  testified he was able to identify Douglas due to prior drug transactions\r\n  involving Douglas. Â Â Â \r\nFollowing Officer McLeodâ€™s statement, Douglasâ€™s counsel alerted\r\n  the trial judge that he had a motion to raise. The trial judge denied any\r\n  potential motion by replying, â€œ[w]eâ€™re going forward,â€ and immediately\r\n  instructed the jury they were â€œnot to consider that testimony for any purpose\r\n  than identification.â€ The trial judgeâ€™s comments note that Douglasâ€™s counsel\r\n  opened the door to this testimony by repeated questions of how Officer McLeod\r\n  could identify Douglas in the automobile. The trial judgeâ€™s curative\r\n  instructions further emphasized that Douglas was only charged with distribution\r\n  of crack cocaine resulting from an event on March 15, 2004, and the jury was to\r\n  â€œdisregard any testimony involving any activity of any kind other than if\r\n  [they] care to use it for identification only.â€ \r\nWe find that Officer McLeodâ€™s remarks on Douglasâ€™s prior drug\r\n  sales were allowed into evidence for the purpose of resolving identity, one of\r\n  the five exceptions of Rule 404(b), SCRE, which allows prior bad acts to be\r\n  admitted into evidence.Â  Although the trial court did not conduct a Rule 403,\r\n  SCRE, â€œon-the-recordâ€ analysis in matters pertaining to the admission of prior\r\n  bad acts, the curative instructions evince the trial courtâ€™s clear balancing of\r\n  probative value versus prejudicial effect. State v. King, 349 S.C. 142,\r\n  155-57, 561 S.E.2d 640, 647 (Ct. App. 2002).Â Â  If Douglas was prejudiced, any\r\n  such prejudice was cured by the trial judgeâ€™s curative instruction.Â  The\r\n  instruction was straightforward and refrained from reiterating or emphasizing\r\n  Officer McLeodâ€™s statement.Â  State v. Edwards, 373 S.C. 230, 237,\r\n  644 S.E.2d 66, 69 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  \r\nFurthermore, appellate courts will not generally set aside\r\n  convictions due to insubstantial errors which donâ€™t affect the result. State\r\n    v. Douglas, 369 S.C. 424, 432, 632 S.E.2d 845, 849 (2006).Â  In determining\r\n  if an error is harmless, the appellate court will review the entire record to\r\n  determine what effect the error had on the verdict. Id.Â  â€œAn\r\n  insubstantial error not affecting the result of the trial is harmless where guilt\r\n  has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other rational\r\n  conclusion can be reached.â€ State v. White, 372 S.C. 364, 386, 642\r\n  S.E.2d 607, 618 (Ct. App. 2007). In the instant case, the State presented testimony from a\r\n  confidential informant who was well acquainted with Douglas, a phone record\r\n  showing Douglas received a call from the location of the drug exchange minutes\r\n  before the transaction occurred, evidence the substance exchanged was crack\r\n  cocaine, and an audio recording of the drug transaction.Â  Â Â \r\nIn addition, Officer McLeodâ€™s testimony could not have affected\r\n  the outcome of the trial because Candrilli previously testified that Douglas sold crack before the event in question. Â Improperly\r\n  admitted evidence is harmless where cumulative. State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 455, 463, 469 S.E.2d 49, 54 (1996).Â  The trial judge interjected a curative instruction ex\r\n    mero motu that the court was permitting the testimony of how Candrilli knew\r\n  Douglas â€œonly as an identification issue and for no other purpose.â€ Douglas did not object. Â Accordingly,\r\n  we can discern no abuse of discretion in the trial judgeâ€™s denial of Douglasâ€™s motion for mistrial.\r\nII. Evidence in the Solicitorâ€™s Closing Argument\r\nIn his closing argument the solicitor demonstrated that the slip\r\n  of paper Candrilli used on the witness stand in recalling phone numbers was\r\n  torn from his legal pad. The solicitor admitted he wrote some of the phone\r\n  numbers for Candrilli and explained that the slip of paper was only to refresh\r\n  Candrilliâ€™s recollection of phone numbers associated with an incident that\r\n  occurred sixteen months prior to trial. Douglas argues the trial court erred in\r\n  failing to grant a mistrial based on the solicitorâ€™s comments on matters not\r\n  introduced into evidence at trial.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, we note this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  Douglasâ€™s counsel did not make a timely objection to the solicitorâ€™s closing but instead\r\n  delayed until after the jury had been charged before raising any objections.Â \r\n  â€œIt is a fundamental principal that a contemporaneous objection is required at\r\n  trial to properly preserve an error for appellate review[2].â€ State v. Black, 319 S.C.\r\n  515, 521, 462 S.E.2d 311, 315 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  The proper course of action\r\n  when counsel makes an improper statement is for opposing counsel to immediately object, have a record made of the statement, and ask the court for a distinct\r\n  ruling thereon.Â  Id. at 521, 462 S.E.2d at 315.Â  Failure to object when\r\n  evidence is offered amounts to a waiver of the right to object. Id. at 521-22, 462 S.E.2d at 315.Â  \r\nEven\r\n  if this argument were preserved for appellate review, the solicitorâ€™s\r\n  presentation of the legal pad from which the slip of paper was torn and his\r\n  comments regarding who wrote the telephone numbers on the paper afford no basis\r\n  for a mistrial. \r\nA solicitor may not rely on statements not in evidence during\r\n  closing argument.Â  State v. Gaines, 271 S.C 65, 66, 244 S.E.2d 539, 540\r\n  (1978).Â  Arguments must be confined to evidence in the record and reasonable\r\n  inferences therefrom, although failure to do so will not automatically result\r\n  in reversal.Â  State v. Copeland, 321 S.C. 318, 468 S.E.2d 620 (1996).Â  A\r\n  new trial will not be granted unless the solicitor's comments so infected the\r\n  trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due\r\n  process. State v. Coleman, 301 S.C 57, 61, 389 S.E.2d 659, 661 (1990)\r\n  (citing Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637 (1974)).\r\nHere, the solicitor\r\n  improperly introduced new evidence to the jury in his closing argument by\r\n  explaining he wrote some of the phone numbers on the slip and by demonstrating\r\n  the origin of the slip of paper.Â  However, the solicitorâ€™s comments do not\r\n  automatically mandate reversal if they do not result in prejudice to the\r\n  defendant. Gill v. State, 346 S.C. 209, 221, 552 S.E.2d 26, 33 (2001).Â  \r\nâ€œNo definite rule\r\n  of law governs finding an error harmless; rather, the\r\n  materiality and prejudicial character of the error must be determined from its\r\n  relationship to the entire case.â€Â  State v. Gillian, 360 S.C. 433,\r\n  454-55, 602 S.E.2d 62, 73 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œIn determining whether an error is\r\n  harmless, the appellate court must review the entire record to determine what\r\n  effect the error had on the verdict.â€ State v. Douglas, 369 S.C. 424,\r\n  432, 632 S.E.2d 845, 849 (2006).Â  Error is harmless where it could not\r\n  reasonably have affected the result of the trial. In re Harvey, 355 S.C.\r\n  53, 63, 584 S.E.2d 893, 897 (2003).Â  Generally, appellate courts will not set\r\n  aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not affecting the result. Douglas, 369 S.C. at 432, 632 S.E.2d at 849.\r\nBased on the totality of the record we find the solicitor's\r\n  comment, although an improper explanation of the slip of paper Candrilli used\r\n  on the witness stand, was harmless error.Â  First, the solicitorâ€™s\r\n  explanation of the source of the slip of paper did not go to the heart of the\r\n  crime for which Douglas was charged.Â  Whether the solicitor or Candrilli wrote on the slip\r\n  of paper has little if any probative value as to the material elements of distribution\r\n  of crack cocaine.Â  See State v. Black, 319\r\n  S.C. 515, 522, 462 S.E.2d 311, 316 (Ct. App. 1995) (noting whether a trooper\r\n  was or was not driving an unmarked car has little if any probative value as to\r\n  the defendantâ€™s crime of speeding).Â  Second, the solicitorâ€™s explanation\r\n  uncovered conflicting testimony by the Stateâ€™s own witness. The weight of the\r\n  evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are matters within the province\r\n  of the jury. Fortner v. Carnes, 258 S.C. 455, 461, 189 S.E.2d 24, 27\r\n  (1972).Â  Douglas was not prejudiced by the solicitorâ€™s closing argument which\r\n  potentially cast speculation upon the truth of Candrilliâ€™s statements from the\r\n  witness stand.Â  Finally,\r\n  we find the evidence of Douglasâ€™s guilt overwhelming based on (1) testimony by\r\n  Candrilli regarding the drug transaction; (2) the audio recording documenting\r\n  the transaction; and (3) the phone records showing a call was placed from the\r\n  pay phone at Crossroads Grocery to Douglasâ€™s cell phone a short time before the\r\n  transaction occurred.\r\nIII. Comments on Drugs in Society During Solicitorâ€™s\r\n  Closing Argument \r\nAt the end of his closing argument, the solicitor acknowledged the\r\n  juryâ€™s decision involved taking Douglasâ€™s liberty but that the juryâ€™s decision\r\n  also affected â€œthe liberty of every youthâ€¦the liberty of every young person,\r\n  every person that goes to Marlboro County High School, every person from this\r\n  entire county.â€ The solicitor also commented on the omnipresent nature of drugs\r\n  when he said, â€œ[i]t is not just stopping here in Marlboro County.Â  It goes to Chesterfield.Â  It goes to Dillon.Â  It goes to Darlington.Â  It goes to North Carolina.Â  It\r\n  goes to everywhere because drugs are a universal problem, and drugs are\r\n  everywhere.â€ Â \r\nThe solicitor concluded by stating, â€œif you today find that the\r\n  evidence is significant enough to find him guilty, I believe that you will be\r\n  doing this community and this society a wonderful, wonderful favor by taking a\r\n  drug dealer off of the streets and placing him where he belongs where he canâ€™t\r\n  do harm to anyone elseâ€¦ [t]hereâ€™s going to be problems butâ€¦the less drug\r\n  dealers there are on the streets, the better off we are.â€ Douglas argues the\r\n  trial court erred in failing to grant his motion for mistrial based on the\r\n  solicitorâ€™s closing argument.Â  We disagree.\r\nAgain we note this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  Douglasâ€™s counsel did not make a timely objection to the solicitorâ€™s closing but instead delayed\r\n  until after the jury had been charged before raising any objections[3].Â  Even\r\n  if this argument were preserved for appellate review, the solicitorâ€™s\r\n  discussion of drugs in schools and surrounding counties affords no basis for a\r\n  mistrial. \r\nThe appropriateness of a solicitor's closing argument is a matter\r\n  left to the trial court's discretion. State v. King, 349 S.C. 142, 160,\r\n  561 S.E.2d 640, 649 (Ct. App. 2002). An appellate court will not disturb the\r\n  trial court's ruling regarding closing argument unless there is an abuse of\r\n  that discretion.

Woods, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-497 \r\n  Submitted October 1, 2007 â€“ Filed October\r\n  16, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART; REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Jeffrey Raymond Moorehead, of Aiken, for\r\n          Appellant\r\n        Gary Hudson Smith, III, of Aiken, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In\r\n  this divorce action, William L. Harris\r\n  (Husband) claims the family court erred in awarding alimony, equitably dividing\r\n  the marital estate, and awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to his former wife, Rodell\r\n  Harris (Wife).Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.[1]\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThe\r\n  parties were married on March 19, 1982, and separated approximately twenty-one\r\n  years later on October 30, 2003. Â At the time of the final hearing Husband was\r\n  seventy-four and Wife was sixty-six. Â Both parties are retired. No children\r\n  were born into the marriage. \r\nIn\r\n  November 2003, Wife commenced this action by filing a summons and complaint for\r\n  pendente lite and permanent alimony, equitable division of the marital assets\r\n  including the debts, and attorneyâ€™s fees. Husband responded requesting an equitable\r\n  division of marital assets and debts.Â  Husband also requested attorneyâ€™s fees,\r\n  but later withdrew his request during the final hearing. Following a December\r\n  2003 hearing the family court issued a temporary order granting Wife pendente\r\n  lite alimony in the amount of $400 per month. \r\nAt\r\n  the final hearing on July 12, 2006, the family court heard testimony on the\r\n  partiesâ€™ financial standings and a tax debt from 2003. Â Both parties\r\n  also testified regarding their two houses, the nature of their relationship,\r\n  and Husbandâ€™s often uncompromising and sometimes hostile temperament with\r\n  regard to Wife, her family members, his former attorneys, and contractors. \r\nOn\r\n  August 9, 2006, the family court issued a final order (1) granting the parties\r\n  a divorce on the ground of one yearâ€™s continuous separation, (2) approving the\r\n  partiesâ€™ stipulated division of personal property, (3) finding Husband had\r\n  greater fault in the breakup of the marriage, (4) directing Husband to pay Wife\r\n  $350 per month in alimony, (5) granting the partiesâ€™ house in Saluda to Wife\r\n  and the partiesâ€™ house in North Augusta to Husband, (6) denying Husbandâ€™s\r\n  request for sweat equity in both houses, (7) finding Wife has no responsibility\r\n  for any of the tax penalties the Husband incurred due to an early withdrawal of\r\n  his savings, and (8) ordering Husband to contribute $5,000 to Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees. Â Husband appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has jurisdiction to\r\n  find the facts in accordance with its view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.&nbsp; Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414\r\n  S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).&nbsp; However, this broad scope of review does not\r\n  require us to disregard the findings of the family court.&nbsp; Stevenson v.\r\n    Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).&nbsp; We are\r\n  mindful that the family court, which saw and heard the witnesses, was in a\r\n  better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to\r\n  their testimony.&nbsp; Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d\r\n  610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Our broad scope of review also does not relieve appellant\r\n  of his burden to convince this court the family court committed error.&nbsp; Skinner\r\n    v. King, 272 S.C. 520, 522-23, 252 S.E.2d 891, 892 (1979).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Alimony\r\nHusband\r\n  claims the family courtâ€™s grant of permanent, periodic alimony and the amount\r\n  awarded constitute an abuse of discretion. Â More specifically, Husband\r\n  argues that Wife can earn enough to support herself, the family courtâ€™s final\r\n  award of alimony was based upon the award of pendente lite alimony at the\r\n  temporary hearing, and the family courtâ€™s finding that he was more responsible\r\n  for the breakup of the marriage erroneously contributed to the decision to\r\n  award alimony. We find no merit in these arguments.\r\nAn award of alimony rests within the sound discretion of the\r\n  family court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177,\r\n  183-84, 554 S.E.2d 421, 424 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2001).Â  â€œAlimony is a substitute for the support which is normally\r\n  incident to the marital relationship.â€Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C.\r\n  289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113\r\n  (Ct. App. 1988).Â  The amount\r\n  of alimony is also within the sound discretion of the family court and should\r\n  not be disturbed on appeal unless an abuse of discretion is shown. Smith v.\r\n    Smith, 264 S.C. 624, 628, 216 S.E.2d 541, 543 (1975). An abuse of\r\n  discretion occurs either when a court is controlled by an error of law or when\r\n  the order, based upon findings of fact, lacks evidentiary support. Townsend\r\n    v. Townsend, 356 S.C. 70, 73, 587 S.E.2d 118, 119 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  If a\r\n  claim for alimony is well founded, it is the duty of the family court to make\r\n  an alimony award that is fit, equitable, and just.Â  Allen, 347 S.C. at 184,\r\n  554 S.E.2d at 424. \r\nÂ Factors to be considered in making an alimony award\r\n  include:&nbsp;(1) duration of the marriage; (2) physical and emotional health\r\n  of the parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4) employment\r\n  history and earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living during the\r\n  marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the parties; (7) current\r\n  and reasonably anticipated expenses of the parties; (8) marital and non-marital\r\n  properties of the parties; (9) custody of children; (10) marital misconduct or\r\n  fault; (11) tax consequences; (12) prior support obligations; and (13) other\r\n  factors the court considers relevant. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2006).Â  \r\nA. Wifeâ€™s Income\r\nThe\r\n  record reflects that the family court properly considered the statutory factors\r\n  of Section 20-3-130(C) of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n  2006), including the partiesâ€™ age, health, retirement status, duration\r\n  of the marriage, fault in the breakup of the marriage, and substantial\r\n  difference in monthly income before awarding alimony in the amount of $350 per\r\n  month to Wife. Â In its order the family court\r\n  calculated Husbandâ€™s and Wifeâ€™s gross monthly income using the figures\r\n  each party supplied on their 2006 financial statements.Â  The family court noted\r\n  that Wife receives $608 per month from her pension, $1,413.50 per month from\r\n  Social Security, and $72 per month from her investments, resulting in a total\r\n  monthly income of $1,823.50.Â  Husband receives $1,423 per month from his\r\n  pension and $1,160 per month from Social Security resulting in a total monthly\r\n  income of $2,583, which is $760 more than Wife receives each month.Â  \r\nHusbandâ€™s\r\n  argument that Wife can earn enough to support herself fails to illustrate how\r\n  the family courtâ€™s award of alimony was based upon an error of law or a lack of\r\n  evidence.Â  We find no abuse of discretion in the family courtâ€™s award of\r\n  alimony.\r\nB. Previous Award of Alimony\r\nHusbandâ€™s\r\n  second argument that the family courtâ€™s final award of alimony was based upon\r\n  the award of pendente lite alimony at the temporary hearing also fails.Â  The\r\n  temporary hearing in which Wife was awarded pendente lite alimony in the amount\r\n  of $400 per month occurred over two years prior to the final hearing.Â  In\r\n  addition, different judges presided over the temporary hearing and the final\r\n  divorce hearing.[2]Â \r\n  When a dispute arose during the final hearing regarding both partiesâ€™ failure\r\n  to follow the exact directions of the temporary order, the family court\r\n  remarked that its decisions would not be impacted by another judgeâ€™s long-ago\r\n  ruling on this matter and it could not â€œgo back and undo what was done or was\r\n  not done.â€Â  The family court directly addressed and dispelled the idea at the\r\n  core of Husbandâ€™s argument that the alimony award was fashioned due to a prior\r\n  award of pendente lite alimony.\r\nC. Husbandâ€™s Greater Fault\r\nHusbandâ€™s\r\n  final argument that the family court improperly considered the partiesâ€™ fault\r\n  in the breakup of the marriage also fails.Â  Section 20-3-130(C)(10) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) states that marital fault\r\n  is a proper factor to be considered in the decision to award alimony.Â  \r\nII. Equitable Distribution of Marital Estate\r\nHusband\r\n  claims the family court did not effect an equitable division of the marital\r\n  estate. Â More accurately, Husband argues the family court erred in not\r\n  allocating to Wife part of the nearly $43,000 tax debt incurred by Husband. Â Husband\r\n  also argues the family courtâ€™s finding that Husband is not entitled to sweat\r\n  equity in the partiesâ€™ two houses affected the equitable division of the\r\n  marital estate. Â We agree with Husbandâ€™s assertion that the marital\r\n  estate was not equitably divided, but disagree with Husbandâ€™s contention that\r\n  the family court erred in denying him sweat equity.\r\nA. Tax Debt\r\nHusband\r\n  incurred tax debt in the summer of 2003 when he withdrew money from his IRA but\r\n  did not file a tax return within the appropriate time. Â Husband stated he\r\n  withdrew the money from the IRA because he was not receiving much interest. Â Wife\r\n  first learned of Husbandâ€™s actions when he returned home and told her â€œI cussed\r\n  [the financial advisor] out and took my money out.â€ Neither party knew Husband\r\n  incurred tax liability due to his hasty actions until February 2004. Despite\r\n  being separated, Wife agreed to file a joint tax return which decreased\r\n  Husbandâ€™s tax penalty to $43,000. Â The IRS issued a tax refund in\r\n  response to the partiesâ€™ joint filing, but Wife did not receive any portion of\r\n  the refund. Â \r\nWe\r\n  initially note that neither party nor the family court asserts the tax debt is\r\n  non-marital property. Â Instead, the family court simply apportioned the\r\n  tax debt to Husband in the division of the marital estate.Â  \r\nThe apportionment of marital property will not be disturbed on\r\n  appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Bungener v. Bungener, 291 S.C.\r\n  247, 251-52, 353 S.E.2d 147, 150 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Section 20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n  2006) lists fifteen factors for the court to consider in equitably apportioning\r\n  a marital estate. On appeal, this court looks to the overall fairness of the\r\n  apportionment. Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107,\r\n  113 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  If the end result is equitable, it is irrelevant that the\r\n  appellate court would have arrived at a different apportionment. Id.\r\nHere, the\r\n  family court considered the partiesâ€™ (1) stipulation as to the division of\r\n  marital property, (2) two houses, (3) savings and investment plans, and (4)\r\n  monthly income, as well as (5) the length of the marriage, (6) Husbandâ€™s\r\n  greater fault in the breakup of the marriage, (7) and the alimony award to\r\n  Wife. Â Our review of the record convinces us the family court addressed\r\n  factors under the statute governing apportionment with sufficiency to\r\n  indicate the family court was cognizant of those factors. Â However, we find the\r\n  overall distribution of sixty-three percent of the marital estate to Wife and\r\n  thirty-seven percent of the marital estate to Husband is not equitable for a\r\n  marriage that lasted twenty-one years. See Smith v. Smith, 294\r\n  S.C. 194, 363 S.E.2d 404 (Ct. App. 1987) (preserving a fifty-fifty\r\n  apportionment of the marital estate in an eighteen year marriage); Griffith\r\n    v. Griffith, 332 S.C. 630, 506 S.E.2d 526 (Ct. App. 1998) (approving a\r\n  fifty-fifty division of marital property in a marriage of twelve years).Â  Given\r\n  the trend in case law for an equal apportionment of property in a long-term\r\n  marriage, we modify the family courtâ€™s apportionment of the marital estate by\r\n  awarding Husband forty-five percent of the marital estate and Wife fifty-five\r\n  percent of the marital estate. \r\nB. Sweat Equity\r\nHusband\r\n  fails to specifically appeal the fact that the family court erred in not\r\n  granting him sweat equity but addresses it in a circumjacent manner claiming\r\n  the absence of such an award affected the equitable division of the marital\r\n  estate. Â We find no merit in this argument.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  family court heard extensive testimony regarding Husbandâ€™s work on the partiesâ€™\r\n  houses and even divulged its awareness of the skill and labor required to\r\n  perform the alterations Husband made to the houses.Â  Nevertheless, the family\r\n  court properly found that Husband did not present the proof needed for the\r\n  family court to find the Husbandâ€™s actions merited any special equity in the\r\n  houses. Â See Arnal v. Arnal, 363\r\n  S.C. 268, 294-95, 609 S.E.2d 821,\r\n  835 (Ct. App. 2005) (finding a husband failed to prove his labor made material\r\n  contributions warranting special equity since the husband presented no\r\n  testimony concerning any appreciation in value).Â  The family court also\r\n  noted that both parties contributed different forms of sweat equity throughout\r\n  the twenty-one year marriage and it would be impossible for the family court to\r\n  measure the value of all those contributions. Â Â \r\nIII. Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nHusband\r\n  claims the family court abused its discretion in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to\r\n  Wife. Â Specifically, Husband argues that once he withdrew his request\r\n  for attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court should have either abandoned the notion\r\n  of awarding attorneyâ€™s fees or abandoned the partiesâ€™ settlement proposals[3] and awarded attorneyâ€™s fees based on what occurred at the final hearing. Â Husband\r\n  also argues the family court used its award of alimony as a factor in\r\n  determining Husband should contribute to Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees. We disagree.\r\nWhether\r\n  to award attorneyâ€™s fees is a matter within the sound discretion of the family\r\n  court, and the award will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion.&nbsp; Bakala v. Bakala, 352 S.C. 612, 633-34, 576 S.E.2d\r\n  156, 167 (2003).&nbsp; In determining whether an award of attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n  should be granted, the family court should consider the following:&nbsp;each\r\n  partyâ€™s ability to pay their own fee, the beneficial results obtained by\r\n  counsel, the financial conditions of the parties, and the effect of the fee on\r\n  each partyâ€™s standard of living.&nbsp; E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471,\r\n  476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).&nbsp; To determine the amount of attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees to award, the family court should consider the nature, extent, and\r\n  difficulty of the services rendered; the time necessarily devoted to the case;\r\n  counselâ€™s professional standing; the contingency of compensation; the\r\n  beneficial results obtained; and the customary legal fees for similar\r\n  services.&nbsp; Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d\r\n  313, 315 (1991).\r\nWe\r\n  find no abuse of discretion in the award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The family court adequately\r\n  considered the factors set forth in Glasscock when awarding attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees to Wife.Â  There is no indication alimony was a factor in the attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees.Â  Further, Wife obtained a beneficial result that was appropriately\r\n  considered by the family court.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the\r\n  ruling of the family court in regard to the award of alimony, the refusal to\r\n  award sweat equity, and the award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We reverse and remand to\r\n  the family court for re-allocation of the marital estate in accordance with\r\n  this opinion.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED\r\n  IN PART AND REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON and THOMAS, JJ.,\r\n  and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The Honorable Peter R. Nuessle conducted the\r\n  temporary hearing and issued the temporary order. The Honorable Henry T.

Mitchell Brown, B. Rush Smith, III, Thad H. Westbrook, and Christina\r\n  Rampey Hunoval, all of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tJohn Martin Foster, of Rock Hill, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  Beneficial Mortgage Co. of South Carolina (Beneficial) appeals the special circuit judgeâ€™s order granting John Goreâ€™s\r\n  (Gore) motion to restore his case to the active docket.Â  We dismiss the appeal\r\n  without prejudice.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn December 1, 2003, Gore filed a\r\n  complaint against Beneficial, alleging Beneficial failed to enter satisfaction\r\n  of a mortgage given to it by Gore.Â  Beneficial responded to the complaint in\r\n  its answer filed on February 6, 2004.\r\nThe\r\n  master-in-equity assigned to hear the case as a special circuit court judge\r\n  sent a form letter to Goreâ€™s counsel, dated August 5, 2004, requesting counsel\r\n  send a reference fee to the judge in order to go forward with the case.[2]Â  The letter stated â€œ[i]f the fee is\r\n  not received within 30 days from the date of this letter, the case will be\r\n  dismissed for failure to prosecute.Â  The case will not be restored to the\r\n  roster of cases except upon motion to restore and a showing of good cause.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  The trial judge, in an order filed September 24,\r\n  2004, dismissed the action sua sponte for failure to prosecute.[3]Â  Gore did not appeal the order or\r\n  move for reconsideration under Rule 59, SCRCP.\r\nOn\r\n  November 11, 2004, Gore filed a motion to restore pursuant to Rules 40 and 41, SCRCP.Â  The special circuit court judge, by order filed on May 11, 2005,\r\n  restored the case to the non-jury trial docket.Â  The judge, in his order,\r\n  explained the â€œaction was dismissed with the right to restore for good cause.â€Â \r\n  The judge found â€œthe parties were engaged in settlement negotiations at or\r\n  about the time the order of dismissal issued.â€Â  In granting the motion to\r\n  restore, the court â€œnoted its use of such orders as a sanction, and its\r\n  practice of allowing reinstatement based on a liberal construction of â€˜good\r\n  cause.â€™ â€Â  The judge, observing â€œthe body of law dealing with default in which\r\n  the adverse party is required to show prejudice,â€ specifically found that\r\n  restoration of the action would not prejudice Beneficial.Â  Beneficial now\r\n  appeals the special circuit judgeâ€™s order granting Goreâ€™s motion to restore.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBeneficial argues\r\n  the special circuit judgeâ€™s order of dismissal for failure to prosecute\r\n  dismissed the action with prejudice and operated as an adjudication on the\r\n  merits.Â  Alternatively, Beneficial argues that even if the order did not\r\n  dismiss the action with prejudice, the special circuit court judge no longer\r\n  retained jurisdiction to act upon Goreâ€™s motion to restore.\r\nOur supreme court\r\n  has held â€œ[t]he decision on a motion to restore the case to the active docket\r\n  is not a final judgment and is interlocutory and, therefore, not immediately appealable.â€Â  Shields v. Martin Marietta Corp., 303 S.C. 469, 470, 402\r\n  S.E.2d 482, 483 (1991).Â  It is well settled that an interlocutory order is not\r\n  immediately appealable unless it involves the merits of the case or affects a\r\n  substantial right.Â  Brown v. County of Berkeley, 366 S.C. 354, 361, 622\r\n  S.E.2d 533, 537 (2005); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330 (1977 &amp; Supp. 2006).Â \r\n  Because Beneficial is appealing the grant of Goreâ€™s motion to restore, the\r\n  appeal is interlocutory and therefore not properly before us.Â  See Shields,\r\n  303 S.C. at 470, 402 S.E.2d at 483 (1991) (noting the â€œ[a]voidance of trial is\r\n  not a â€˜substantial rightâ€™ entitling a party to immediate appeal of an\r\n  interlocutory order.â€) (quoting Blackwelder v. State Dept. of Human Res., 299 S.E.2d 777 (1983).\r\nSubject\r\n  matter jurisdiction is the power to hear and determine cases of the general\r\n  class to which the proceedings in question belong.Â  Majors v. South Carolina Secs. Comâ€™n, 373 S.C. 153, 159, 644 S.E.2d 710, 713 (2007).Â  We believe\r\n  the special circuit court judge in this case had the power to hear and\r\n  rule upon Goreâ€™s motion to restore.Â  We note the â€œ â€˜difference between a want\r\n  of jurisdiction in which case the court has no power to adjudicate at all, and\r\n  a mistake in the exercise of undoubted jurisdiction in which case the action of\r\n  the trial court is not void although it may be subject to direct attack on\r\n  appeal.â€™ â€Â  Fryer v.

Thomas, all of\r\n          Columbia and William Young, of North Myrtle Beach, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Shawnee Holdings, LLC (Shawnee), a third-party purchaser,\r\n  appeals the master-in-equityâ€™s order setting aside a foreclosure sale and asks\r\n  this Court to set aside a subsequent foreclosure sale.Â  We affirm in part and\r\n  remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nRicky Ray Truitt\r\n  and Jackie Lee Truitt (Truitts) obtained a mortgage on property in Little\r\n  River, South Carolina, from Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems (Mortgage\r\n  Electronic).Â  Eventually, the Truitts stopped making payments on the mortgage.Â \r\n  Mortgage Electronic foreclosed on the subject property, and a foreclosure sale\r\n  was held in Horry County on June 5, 2006.[1] Â Mortgage Electronic gave bidding instructions to its attorney regarding the\r\n  maximum bid Mortgage Electronic would make on the property.Â  Mortgage\r\n  Electronic authorized a bid not to exceed $120,505.32.Â  Mortgage Electronicâ€™s\r\n  attorney forwarded the bidding instructions to Mary Alice Hendrick (Hendrick),\r\n  who has been responsible for handling the bidding in judicial sales at the Horry County courthouse for twenty to twenty-five years.Â  However, when the bidding began,\r\n  Hendrick stopped bidding at $85,000.Â  As a result, Shawnee purchased the\r\n  subject property for $85,000.Â   \r\nMortgage Electronic made a motion to set aside the\r\n  foreclosure sale on the basis of bidder mistake.Â  At the hearing on the motion,\r\n  Hendrick testified to the circumstances surrounding the sale and to the fact\r\n  that she has handled the bidding for the Horry County courthouse for twenty to\r\n  twenty-five years.[2]Â \r\n  Hendrick testified she had â€œno clueâ€ as to what happened the day of the sale and\r\n  described her failure to continue bidding as a â€œtotal mistake.â€Â  Â Â \r\nThe master entered an order setting aside the June 5,\r\n  2006 foreclosure sale pursuant to Rule 60(a), SCRCP, on the basis of bidder\r\n  mistake.Â  The property was then resold at a subsequent foreclosure sale on\r\n  August 7, 2006.Â  Shawnee made a motion to have the subsequent sale set aside.[3]Â \r\n  The master did not rule on this motion.Â  This appeal followed.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œA mortgage foreclosure is an action in equity.Â  Our\r\n  scope of review of a case heard by a master who enters a final judgment is to\r\n  determine facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.â€Â  E. Sav. Bank, FSB v. Sanders, 373 S.C. 349, 354, 644 S.E.2d\r\n  802, 805 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  â€œHowever, the determination of whether a judicial\r\n  sale should be set aside is a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial\r\n  court.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œThe review of a judicial sale is equitable in nature and\r\n  within the discretion of the trial court.â€Â  Id.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Setting Aside the\r\n  Second Sale\r\nShawnee argues the\r\n  second foreclosure sale should be set aside because the thirty-day appeal\r\n  period stemming from the first foreclosure sale had not expired prior to the\r\n  second sale.Â   \r\nThis Court follows\r\n  the well-settled rule that unless a question has been presented to the court\r\n  below for consideration, we will not consider the question on appeal.Â  Williamson\r\n    v. S.C. Elec. &amp; Gas Co., 236 S.C. 101, 107, 113 S.E.2d 345, 348\r\n  (1960).Â  â€œAn appellate court exists for the correction of errors committed in a\r\n  lower court, and if such court has not had the opportunity to decide the\r\n  question presented, there is no error for the appellate court to correct.â€Â  Id.Â  There must be some evidence in the record that the question was presented to or\r\n  passed upon by the court below for this Court to address that question.Â  Cooper\r\n    v. Firemenâ€™s Fund Ins. Co., 252 S.C. 629, 634-35, 167 S.E.2d 745, 748\r\n  (1969).Â   \r\nShawnee filed a\r\n  motion to set aside the second foreclosure sale but never gave the master an\r\n  opportunity to rule upon the motion before filing and serving the present\r\n  appeal to set aside both foreclosure sales.[4]Â \r\n  Shawnee filed the motion to set aside the second sale on the same day the\r\n  notice of appeal was filed.Â  In order to appeal the second sale, the motion\r\n  must have been raised to and ruled upon by the master.Â  Shawnee failed to seek\r\n  a ruling from the master regarding the second foreclosure sale; accordingly,\r\n  the issue of setting aside that sale is not ripe for our review.Â  We remand the\r\n  issue to the master to determine whether Shawnee is entitled to have the second\r\nforeclosure sale set aside.Â Â Â  Â \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Order Setting\r\n  Aside First Sale\r\nShawnee contends the\r\n  master erred in setting aside the first foreclosure sale based on bidder\r\n  mistake.Â  We disagree.  \r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure empower the court to correct clerical errors\r\n  and mistakes in judgments and orders.Â  Rule 60(a), SCRCP.Â  Rule 60(a) provides\r\n  in pertinent part: â€œClerical mistakes in judgments, orders or other parts of\r\n  the record and errors therein arising from oversight or omission may be\r\n  corrected by the court at any time of its own initiative or on the motion of\r\n  any party and after such notice, if any, as the court orders.â€Â  By definition,\r\n  a clerical error is a mistake in writing or copying, and â€œ[a]s applied to\r\n  judgments and decrees, it is a mistake or omission by a clerk, counsel, judge\r\n  or printer which is not the result of exercise of judicial function.â€Â  Dion\r\n    v. Ravenel, Eiserhardt Assoc., 316 S.C. 226, 230, 449 S.E.2d 251, 253 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1994).Â  Rule 60(a) has been found to be an appropriate mechanism for\r\n  setting aside a judicial sale where a court employee commits a clerical error.Â  See Goethe v. Cleland, 323 S.C. 50, 53, 448 S.E.2d 574, 575 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1994) (finding the clerk of courtâ€™s typographical error concerning the\r\n  time period in which bidding would remain open was a clerical error).Â  Â \r\nUnder the facts of\r\n  this case, we find the error made in the bidding process to be clerical in\r\n  nature. Â Rule 60(a), therefore, provided the master with discretion to correct\r\n  the mistake and set aside the foreclosure sale.Â  Shawnee argues Hendrick was\r\n  actually an agent for Mortgage Electric, and the master did not have discretion\r\n  to correct the agentâ€™s mistake.Â  Â Â \r\nWhen deciding\r\n  issues on appeal, this Court is confined to the record.Â  Timms v. Timms,\r\n  286 S.C. 291, 294, 333 S.E.2d 74, 75 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  To find an agency\r\n  relationship, the record must provide at least some evidence to support that\r\n  finding.Â  See Young v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Disabilities &amp; Special Needs,\r\n  374 S.C. 360, ___, 649 S.E.2d 488, 492 (2007) (finding the record was devoid of\r\n  any evidence to support a conclusion of an apparent agency relationship).Â  Â Â Â \r\nIn the present case, the record is devoid of any\r\n  evidence establishing an agency relationship between Hendrick and Mortgage\r\n  Electronic.Â  The only evidence in the record indicates Hendrick has handled the\r\n  bidding in the Horry County courthouse for twenty to twenty-five years.Â \r\n  Although Shawnee argues Hendrick was actually an agent for Mortgage Electronic\r\n  at the time she was handling the bidding in the foreclosure sale, Shawnee failed to present any evidence to support this argument.Â  Without evidence of\r\n  Hendrickâ€™s relationship to Mortgage Electronic, we cannot find that there was\r\n  an agency relationship between the two. Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, the order of the master is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND\r\n  REMANDED.[5]\r\nSTILWELL, SHORT, and\r\n  WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The name of the Respondent is MidFirst Bank on the\r\n  briefs and record, but apparently, Mortgage Electronic and MidFirst Bank are\r\n  related or share the same interest.\r\n[2] At the time of bidding, Hendrick was the secretary\r\n  for Circuit Court Judge John Breeden.Â   \r\n[3]Â  Shawnee alleges it did not receive written notice of\r\n  the order setting aside the first sale until August 16, 2006, nor did it have\r\n  notice of the subsequent sale.Â  The motion to set aside the sale and the notice\r\n  of appeal were both filed and served on September 12, 2006.Â   \r\n[4] Both parties stated in their briefs the master\r\n  informally notified them he would not rule on the motion to set aside the\r\n  second sale due to the filing of the notice of appeal.Â   \r\n[5] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-502","title":"State v.

Zelenka, Assistant\r\n          Attorney General S. Creighton Waters, of Columbia;Â  and Solicitor Kevin Scott\r\n          Brackett, of York, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Caniskey\r\n  Horton appeals his convictions for murder, assault and battery with intent to\r\n  kill (ABIK), and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent\r\n  crime.[1]Â \r\n  We affirm.[2]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn the early morning hours of December 21,\r\n  2002, Caniskey Horton fired his gun five times in the parking lot of The Money\r\n  night club.Â  He shot and injured Matthew Cousar (Cousar) and shot and killed\r\n  Jacques Cousar (the deceased).Â   \r\nHorton\r\n  and four others (Hortonâ€™s group) drove to The Money in Rock Hill, South Carolina.Â  Hortonâ€™s group enjoyed their time at the club without incident and then\r\n  exited into the parking lot at approximately 3:30 a.m.Â  Cousar and five others\r\n  (Cousarâ€™s group) exited The Money at approximately the same time.Â  The groups noticed\r\n  that a car had parked very close to a car belonging to a member of Cousarâ€™s group.Â \r\n  A member of Cousarâ€™s group commented on the parked car as Hortonâ€™s group passed.\r\nCousar\r\n  allegedly yelled as Hortonâ€™s group began to drive away.Â  The driver of the\r\n  Horton groupâ€™s vehicle stopped, rolled down the window, and asked Cousar: â€œWhat\r\n  did you say to me?â€ Â Cousar replied that he was talking about the parked car.Â  Cousar\r\n  testified that the Horton group driver then swore at him.Â  Cousar then stated that\r\n  none of the people in Hortonâ€™s vehicle were soldiers.[3]Â  Horton exited the vehicle and\r\n  approached Cousar.Â  There are conflicting accounts of the events following this\r\n  point.Â   \r\nCousar testified he could see that Horton cocked a gun and placed\r\n  it in his jacket upon exiting the vehicle.Â  Horton testified he did not have\r\n  the gun at that time. Â Cousar admitted he then struck Horton in the head with a\r\n  violent blow that knocked him to the ground.Â  The force of the blow either\r\n  dislodged the gun from Horton, or Horton reached into the vehicle for the gun.Â \r\n  Two members of Hortonâ€™s group exited the vehicle and helped Horton back to his\r\n  feet.Â  One of these two men may have handed Horton his gun.Â   \r\nIt is clear that Horton ultimately fired the gun five times in the\r\n  direction of Cousarâ€™s group.Â  Three of the bullets hit the deceased and one hit\r\n  Cousar.Â  Immediately following the shooting, Horton and his group exited the\r\n  parking lot in their vehicle.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  trial court sentenced Horton to concurrent sentences of thirty-five years for\r\n  murder, twenty years for ABIK, five years for possession of the firearm, and\r\n  one year for unlawfully carrying a pistol. Â This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.â€ Â State\r\n    v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  An appellate court\r\n  will not reverse the trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding jury charges absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000).Â  â€œAn abuse\r\n  of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law\r\n  or, when grounded in factual conclusions, is without evidentiary support.â€Â  Id.Â  Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHorton contends\r\n  the trial court erred in its\r\n  instruction to the jury because it was inconsistent with the facts of the case.[4]Â  We disagree.\r\nDuring\r\n  the pre-charge conference, Horton objected to the Stateâ€™s requested charge that\r\n  words alone were not sufficient provocation to justify voluntary manslaughter.Â \r\n  Horton argued that because Cousar initially struck him, an instruction on â€œwords\r\n  aloneâ€ was improper. The trial court charged in part:  \r\nThe provocation needed for voluntary manslaughter must come from\r\n  some act of or related to the victim or victims.Â  Words alone however vulgar or\r\n  insulting are not enough to be legal provocation.Â  Where death is caused by the\r\n  use of a deadly weapon the words must be accompanied by some overt threatening\r\n  act which could have produced the heat of passion.Â  The exercise of a legal\r\n  right no matter how offensive it is to another is never sufficient legal\r\n  provocation for voluntary manslaughter.\r\nHorton argues this charge does not apply to the facts of this case\r\n  and merely confused the jury.Â  Jury\r\n  instructions must be considered in their entirety and, if in their entirety,\r\n  they are free from error, then any potentially misleading portions do not\r\n  constitute reversible error.Â  State v. Jackson, 297 S.C. 523, 526, 377\r\n  S.E.2d 570, 572 (1989).Â  In its entirety, the jury instruction accurately informed\r\n  the jury that words alone are insufficient legal provocation to justify\r\n  voluntary manslaughter.Â  The instructions also informed the jury that an overt threatening act could have produced\r\n  the heat of passion necessary to justify voluntary manslaughter.Â  The jury was\r\n  aware that Cousar struck Horton prior to the shooting and was free to find this\r\n  to be the required overt act.Â  We find no error in the trial courtâ€™s charge to\r\n  the jury.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, Hortonâ€™s convictions are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, SHORT, and WILLIAMS JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â Horton does not appeal his conviction for\r\n  unlawfully carrying a pistol.  \r\n[2] Â We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3] Â Slang indicating the Horton group was not\r\n  â€œtough.â€Â   \r\n[4] Â The State argues this issue is not preserved\r\n  for our review because Hortonâ€™s objection was not sufficiently specific.Â \r\n  Horton objected to the jury instruction stating it went further than the facts\r\n  of the case and that it was uncontradicted that Cousar hit Horton.Â  We find\r\n  Hortonâ€™s objection sufficient to preserve the issue for appellate review. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-503","title":"State v.
