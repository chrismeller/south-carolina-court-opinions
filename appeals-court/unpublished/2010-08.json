Â Sam W. Vetro appeals the\r\n  revocation of his license to practice\r\n  medicine by the South Carolina Board of Medical Examiners.Â  The Administrative\r\n  Law Court affirmed the Boardâ€™s ruling.Â  We affirm. \r\n1. Vetro\r\n  claims that the Board failed to follow procedures outlined in regulations\r\n  81-12.5 and 81-13 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2009), that he was lured\r\n  into waiving his rights to formal hearing procedures, and that the Board\r\n  violated the Americans with Disabilities Act.[1] Â However, because these issues were not raised to and ruled on by the Board, we\r\n  find these issues are not preserved for appellate review.Â  See Brown\r\n    v. S.C. Dep't of Health and Envt'l. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 519-20, 560\r\n  S.E.2d 410, 417 (2002). \r\n2. Vetro\r\n  contends that the Board made erroneous factual findings.Â  In a Memorandum of\r\n  Agreement, Vetro admitted all allegations in the Complaint and that his conduct\r\n  violated section 40-47-200(F)(3), (6), and (8) of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (2001).[2]Â \r\n  Thus, the Boardâ€™s factual determination to revoke, based on these admitted\r\n  allegations, is supported by substantial evidence. Â See Lark v. Bi-Lo,\r\n    Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 136-7, 276 S.E.2d 304, 307 (1981).Â  \r\n3. Finally, Vetro\r\n  argues that the sanction imposed was too harsh and constitutes an abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  The Board has the power to revoke or suspend a medical license.Â  Boggs\r\n    v. State Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 288 S.C. 144, 146, 341 S.E.2d 635, 636\r\n  (1986).Â  Vetro admitted to all allegations in the complaint and that his\r\n  conduct violated subsections (3), (6), and (8) of 40-47-200(F) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code.Â  A finding under any of these subsections is\r\n  &quot;'[m]isconduct' which constitutes grounds for revocation, suspension, or\r\n  restriction of a license or limitation on or discipline of a licensee. . .\r\n  .&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-47-200(F) (2001). Â Therefore, the decision\r\n  to revoke Vetroâ€™s medical license was within the Boardâ€™s discretion.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW,\r\n  C.J., THOMAS and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â 42 U.S.C. Â§ 12101 (2009).\r\n\r\n[2] Chapter 47 of Title 40 of the South Carolina Code has\r\n  been rewritten. Provisions similar to those previously found at section\r\n  40-47-200(F) are now codified at section 40-47-110 of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n  2009).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-382","title":"Sheep Island Plantation v.

S.C. State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002)\r\n  (holding that a trial court must deny a directed verdict motion &quot;when the evidence yields more than one\r\n  inference or its inference is in doubt.&quot;). \r\n  \r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nFEW,\r\n  C.J., THOMAS and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-383","title":"State v.
