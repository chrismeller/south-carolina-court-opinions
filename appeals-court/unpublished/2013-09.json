Based upon the\r\nresponses, the trial judge excused a few panel members and, thereafter, McMillan\r\nutilized four of his five allocated strikes. Among the seated jurors was Juror 102\r\n(Juror).\r\n\r\nAfter three witnesses testified, the trial judge informed counsel, in camera, about a\r\nnote he received from Juror expressing concern about her qualification, in light of\r\nher husband's employment as a reserve deputy. The trial judge called in Juror;\r\nJuror confirmed her husband was a reserve deputy and that she had not discussed\r\nthe case with him. The trial judge then asked Juror if her husband's employment\r\naffected her ability to give either party a fair and impartial trial. Juror responded,\r\n\"No, it wouldn't,\" and was allowed to return to the jury room.\r\n\r\nDefense counsel then objected to Juror's continued service, noting the juror\r\ninformation sheet, which the Clerk's Office prepared, listed the occupation of\r\nJuror's spouse as only \"Environmental Health Management.\" Defense counsel\r\nfurther contended that he would have utilized McMillan's strikes differently had he\r\nknown Juror's husband was a reserve deputy. Shortly thereafter, the trial judge\r\nverified that Juror did fully disclose her husband's employment on the juror\r\nquestionnaire as including both \"Environmental Health Management\" and \"reserve\r\ndeputy,\" but \"the Clerk's Office didn't transmit everything\" that Juror filled out on\r\nher juror questionnaire when the Clerk's Office provided counsel with the juror\r\ninformation sheet. The trial judge then declined to excuse Juror due to this\r\n\"Scri[ve]ner's error,\" noting that defense counsel did not request any voir dire\r\nquestion about spousal employment and that a compilation of information from the\r\njuror questionnaires was available, upon request, from the Clerk's Office.\r\n\r\nThe jury subsequently convicted McMillan on three counts of assault and battery\r\nin the first degree (a lesser-included offense), three counts of attempted armed\r\nrobbery, and one count of possession of a weapon during the commission of a\r\nviolent crime. McMillan was sentenced to thirty years' incarceration. This appeal\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n1The State tried McMillan and David Jakes together. Jakes was indicted for\r\nthree counts of attempted murder, three counts of attempted armed robbery, and\r\none count of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.\r\n\n                                  LAW/ANALYSIS \n\r\n\r\nMcMillan alleges the trial judge erred in refusing to excuse Juror and replace her\r\nwith an alternate because, had he known Juror's husband was a reserve deputy, he\r\nwould have exercised his peremptory challenges differently. Thus, McMillan\r\nessentially argues that because he would have been permitted to exercise a\r\nperemptory strike against Juror, even if she was impartial, based solely upon the\r\noccupation of Juror's husband, the omission of such alleged material information\r\nconstituted prejudice that required replacing Juror with an alternate when the\r\ninformation later came to light.\r\n\r\nNotably, McMillan cites no authority for the specific proposition that a trial court\r\nabuses its discretion in not removing a juror when a defendant contends he would\r\nhave exercised his peremptory challenges differently had he known \"material,\" but\r\npreviously omitted, facts about any particular juror, regardless of that juror's\r\nprofessed impartiality. Because McMillan cites no authoritative support for his\r\nspecific contention, we proceed to determine solely whether Juror was impartial.\r\nSee State v. Porter, 389 S.C. 27, 35, 698 S.E.2d 237, 241 (Ct. App. 2010)\r\n(requiring an appellant to cite authority in \"specific support of his assertion\").\r\nThus, to the extent Juror was impartial, the trial court did not err in refusing to\r\nexcuse Juror.\r\n\r\nSection 14-7-1020 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2012) requires a trial judge,\r\nupon motion of either party, to determine whether a juror is impartial:\r\n\r\n             The court shall, on motion of either party in the suit,\r\n             examine on oath any person who is called as a juror to\r\n             know whether he is related to either party, has any\r\n             interest in the cause, has expressed or formed any\r\n             opinion, or is sensible of any bias or prejudice therein . . .\r\n             If it appears to the court that the juror is not indifferent in\r\n             the cause, he must be placed aside . . . and another must\r\n             be called.\r\n\r\nAccord State v. Cochran, 369 S.C. 308, 321, 631 S.E.2d 294, 301 (2006) (citing\r\nsection 14-7-1020). While such determinations are within the sound discretion of\r\nthe trial judge, \"[t]here is no rule of the common law, nor is there a statute\r\ndisqualifying a juror on account of his relationship to a witness, either by affinity\r\nor consanguinity, within any degree.\" State v. Burgess, 391 S.C. 15, 18, 703\r\n\nS.E.2d 512, 514 (Ct. App. 2010) (citation omitted); accord State v. Mercer, 381\r\nS.C. 149, 158, 672 S.E.2d 556, 560-61 (2009).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the mere fact that a juror's spouse is a law enforcement officer, who\r\nis not involved in the case, does not, in and of itself, render a juror biased and,\r\nthus, unable to serve on a jury; rather, the crux of that determination is whether it\r\n\"appears to the court that the juror is not indifferent in the cause.\" See § 14-7-1020\r\n(stating the trial judge must determine whether a proposed juror is related to either\r\nparty or is otherwise interested in, formed an opinion about, or is biased or\r\nprejudiced toward a party). Moreover, even jurors related by affinity or\r\nconsanguinity to a testifying witness or those who closely knew the putative victim\r\nof a crime are not, absent an inability to maintain impartiality, unqualified. See\r\nState v. Wells, 249 S.C. 249, 259-60, 153 S.E.2d 904, 909-10 (1967) (finding a\r\njuror who directly employed victim qualified); Burgess, 391 S.C. at 18, 703 S.E.2d\r\nat 514 (\"There is no rule of the common law, nor is there a statute disqualifying a\r\njuror on account of his relationship to a witness, either by affinity or consanguinity,\r\nwithin any degree.\" (citation omitted)).\r\n\r\nIn the instant matter, Juror was unrelated to the defendants and the potential\r\nwitnesses, and she did not know the victims; she was merely related to a non-\r\ntestifying law enforcement officer. Furthermore, once the trial judge learned\r\nJuror's husband was a reserve deputy, he asked Juror whether her husband's\r\nemployment would \"in any way affect [her] ability to give the [State] or\r\n[McMillan] . . . a fair and an impartial trial.\" Juror confirmed \"it wouldn't.\"\r\nBecause Juror appeared neither biased nor partial, the trial court did not err in\r\nfinding Juror appeared impartial, despite her husband's status as a reserve deputy.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, because Juror did not conceal any information, partiality cannot be\r\nimputed to her on such a basis. State v. Woods, 345 S.C. 583, 588, 550 S.E.2d 282,\r\n284 (2001) (recognizing that a court may infer that a juror who intentionally\r\nconceals information inquired into is not impartial). \"[I]ntentional concealment\r\noccurs when the question presented to the jury on voir dire is reasonably\r\ncomprehensible to the average juror and the subject of the inquiry is of such\r\nsignificance that the juror's failure to respond is unreasonable.\" Id.\r\n\r\nAt the outset, Juror disclosed her husband's status as a law enforcement officer on\r\nher self-completed juror questionnaire. Thus, Juror unquestionably did not\r\nconceal her husband's occupation at this phase of the jury selection process.\r\nAdditionally, the trial judge asked no question during voir dire that required Juror\r\nto respond with her husband's occupation. While the trial judge did ask whether\r\n\nany potential juror was a member of law enforcement or was related to or a close\r\npersonal friend of the named potential witnesses, which did include some law\r\nenforcement officers, neither inquiry required Juror to disclose the employment\r\nstatus of her non-testifying husband. Moreover, while McMillan could have\r\nrequested the trial judge to ask whether any panel members were related to law\r\nenforcement officers, McMillan concedes he made no such request. Because no\r\nvoir dire question required Juror to respond with her husband's occupation, no\r\nconcealment occurred and, thus, it cannot be inferred that juror was not impartial.2\r\nSee id. at 587, 550 S.E.2d at 284 (requiring a new trial when an identified\r\nconcealment of information (a) was intentional and (b) would have supported a\r\nchallenge for cause or would have been a material factor in the use of peremptory\r\nchallenges). \"As we find no intentional concealment on Juror's part, we need not\r\nfurther determine whether the information would have been a material factor in the\r\nexercise of . . . peremptory strikes.\" State v. Guillebeaux, 362 S.C. 270, 276, 607\r\nS.E.2d 99, 102 (Ct. App. 2004). Hence, the trial court did not err in refusing to\r\ndismiss Juror and to replace her with an alternate.\r\n\r\n                                    CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the decision of the circuit court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW C.J., and GEATHERS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2   Both parties conceded in their briefs that juror concealment did not exist.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-342","title":"State v.

Ellis, 263 S.C. 12, 22, 207\r\nS.E.2d 405, 413 (1974)); id. at 199-200, 470 S.E.2d at 854 (\"Circumstantial\r\nevidence may be used to prove actual possession.\"); State v. Cherry, 361 S.C. 588,\r\n594, 606 S.E.2d 475, 478 (2004) (stating a trial court should not refuse to direct a\r\nverdict \"when the evidence merely raises a suspicion that the accused is guilty,\"\r\nbut also emphasizing that \"a trial judge is not required to find that the evidence\r\ninfers guilt to the exclusion of any other reasonable hypothesis\"); State v.\r\nPuckett, 237 S.C. 369, 379, 117 S.E.2d 369, 374 (1960) (acknowledging in a trial\r\nin which the charges against the defendants included possession of tools used in\r\nthe commission of a crime that many of the tools found in the defendants' car\r\n\"could be put to a lawful use,\" but holding \"it is not reasonable to suppose that a\r\nperson without criminal intent would be driving about with such an assorted [and]\r\ncomplete collection of tools and implements commonly used in burglary, larceny\r\nand safe cracking\").\r\n\r\n2.    As to the charge of criminal conspiracy: Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U.S.\r\n295, 304-05 (1999) (\"[A] car passenger . . . will often be engaged in a common\r\nenterprise with driver, and have the same interest in concealing the fruits or the\r\nevidence of their wrongdoing.\" (emphasis added)); State v.

We also reject the State's arguments that Brown's convictions should be\r\naffirmed on either error preservation grounds or because of general expressions of\r\nremorse that Brown made in court after the verdicts were read. As to error\r\npreservation: Rule 19(a), SCRCrimP (\"On motion of the defendant or on its own\r\nmotion, the court [in a criminal proceeding] shall direct a verdict in the defendant's\r\nfavor on any offense charged in the indictment after the evidence on either side is\r\nclosed, if there is a failure of competent evidence tending to prove the charge in the\r\nindictment.\"); id. (omitting the requirement in Rule 50(a), SCRCP, that \"[a] motion\r\nfor directed verdict shall state the specific grounds therefor\" when such a directed\r\nverdict motion is made during a criminal proceeding); State v.

James, 362 S.C. 557, 562-63, 608 S.E.2d 455, 457-58 (Ct.

On\r\nappeal, Father argues (1) the family court should have considered whether it was in\r\nChild's best interest to be placed with Child's paternal grandmother, and (2) the\r\nCatawba Indian Nation's (the Tribe's) modification of the Indian Child Welfare\r\nAct's (ICWA's) placement preferences violates his rights to due process and equal\r\nprotection under the law. We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the\r\nfollowing authorities:\r\n\r\n1. As to whether the family court should have considered if it was in Child's best\r\ninterest to be placed with Child's paternal grandmother: Spreeuw v. Barker, 385\r\nS.C. 45, 70-71, 682 S.E.2d 843, 856 (Ct. App. 2009) (holding issues not before the\r\nfamily court are not preserved for appellate review); Payne v.

As to whether the Tribe's modification of the ICWA's placement preferences\r\nviolates Father's rights to due process and equal protection under the law: Payne,\r\n382 S.C. at 70, 674 S.E.2d at 519 (\"Issues not raised and ruled upon in the [family]\r\ncourt will not be considered on appeal.\"); Great Games, Inc. v.
