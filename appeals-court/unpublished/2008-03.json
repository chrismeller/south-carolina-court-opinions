Macaulay, Circuit Court\r\n  Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2008-UP-139\r\nHeard January 8, 2008 â€“ Filed March 3,\r\n  2008\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tMary Bass Lohr, of Beaufort, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tT. Wayne Yarbrough, of Bluffton, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  In this personal injury action, Beaufort Memorial Hospital (Hospital) appeals the\r\n  grant of a new trial to Danny R. Prince on the ground that its Quality\r\n  Assurance Committee file should have been made available to Prince during the\r\n  prior trial.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn February 13, 1999, Hospital admitted Prince\r\n  into a fourth-floor room for treatment of job-related injuries.Â  Initially, Prince\r\n  was a compliant patient and exhibited no signs of psychotic behavior.Â  Sometime\r\n  after 10:30 p.m. on February 17, 1999, however, Prince apparently experienced a\r\n  psychotic hallucination in his hospital room and was found by Hospital staff at\r\n  11:20 p.m. on the roof of a lower floor with injuries to his ankles and head.Â \r\n  Although Prince did not remember anything from the incident, the window in his\r\n  room appeared to have been forced open.Â   \r\nOn\r\n  February 15, 2001, Prince brought a negligence action against Hospital and Hospitalâ€™s\r\n  servants and agents.Â  At issue in the case was how and why Prince ended up on\r\n  the roof and whether or not the defendants could or should have prevented the\r\n  incident.\r\nDuring discovery, Prince sought to obtain a copy of a file\r\n  generated by Hospitalâ€™s Quality Assurance Committee pursuant to the Committeeâ€™s\r\n  investigation of the incident.Â  Instead, however, Hospital provided a summary\r\n  of expected witness testimony and refused to give Prince the file, claiming it\r\n  was protected under South Carolina Code sections 40-71-10 and 40-71-20.[1]Â  Consequently, Prince filed a motion\r\n  to compel discovery of the complete Quality Assurance Committee file.Â  The\r\n  trial court denied the motion, and a jury ultimately returned a verdict in Hospitalâ€™s\r\n  favor.Â   \r\nFollowing the denial of his motions for\r\n  judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a new trial, Prince appealed to this Court,\r\n  contending the trial court erred in finding the contents of the file were not\r\n  subject to discovery. Â In an unpublished opinion, this Court held\r\n  that, although Hospitalâ€™s Quality Assurance Committee was within the purview of\r\n  section 40-71-10 to the extent the Committee operated pursuant to bylaws\r\n  approved by Hospital and the information acquired by the Committee was\r\n  protected under section 40-71-20, â€œthe nature of the case demands an in camera\r\n  review of the file.â€Â  Prince v. Beaufort Memâ€™l Hosp., Op. No. 05-UP-602\r\n  (Ct. App. 2006) (S.C. Ct. App. filed April 11, 2006).Â  Accordingly, this Court\r\n  reversed the denial of Princeâ€™s motion for a new trial and remanded the case to\r\n  the trial court for an in camera review of the file, with the following\r\n  instructions:\r\n\r\n\t[T]he circuit court shall conduct an in camera review of the\r\n  committee file. Â Using its discretion, the court shall decide whether the file\r\n  warrants confidentiality.Â  If the circuit court determines that the file\r\n  contains relevant evidence which is not protected by the confidentiality\r\n  statute, then it shall declare a new trial.Â  Alternatively, if the circuit\r\n  court determines that there is no relevant evidence in the committee file or\r\n  that the file is not entitled to protections of the confidentiality statute,\r\n  then the original denial of the new trial and JNOV motion would be affirmed.\r\n\r\nAfter the\r\n  required in camera review of the Quality Assurance Committee file, the trial\r\n  court found Hospital had waived the protections of section 40-71-20 and\r\n  declared a new trial.Â  The trial court based this finding on its observation\r\n  that Hospital â€œused certain witness statement summaries from this committee\r\n  file in order to answer Interrogatories propounded by the Plaintiff.â€Â  Using\r\n  the law on waiver of the attorney-client privilege as a guide, the trial court\r\n  further held that, once the privilege is waived, â€œit is clear that it is waived\r\n  as to all communications on the same subject matter.â€Â   \r\nHospital moved for reconsideration, arguing among other things Prince\r\n  did not raise the issue of waiver in his initial appeal and the trial court\r\n  lacked authority to raise the issue sua sponte on remand.Â  The\r\n  trial court declined to amend its prior order.Â  As to Hospitalâ€™s argument that\r\n  Prince failed to preserve the issue of waiver in his appeal, the trial court\r\n  held Prince â€œraised the issue of waiver specifically several times, and, more\r\n  importantly, . . . the issue of waiver is so intertwined with the issue of\r\n  confidentiality of the file that it was inherently preserved for review.â€Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe decision whether to grant a new\r\n  trial is left to the sound discretion of the trial court\r\n  and generally will not be disturbed on appeal.â€Â  Dropkin v. Beach Villa\r\n    Condominium Assâ€™n, 373 S.C. 360, 363, 644 S.E.2d 808, 809 (Ct. App. 2007)\r\n  (citing Rush v. Blanchard, 310 S.C. 375, 380, 426 S.E.2d 802, 805 (1993)). Â â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence or the conclusions\r\n  reached are controlled by an error of law.â€Â  Wright v. Craft, 372 S.C.\r\n  1, 36, 640 S.E.2d 486, 505 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Hospital first argues\r\n  that Prince, in his initial appeal to this court, failed to challenge the\r\n  rejection of his argument at trial that Hospital had waived its right to assert\r\n  the Quality Assurance Committee file was confidential under section 40-71-20\r\n  and is therefore barred by the law of the case doctrine from a finding on\r\n  remand that Hospital waived its right to assert that the Quality Assurance\r\n  Committee file was confidential.Â  We agree.\r\nAs a general rule,\r\n  an unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case.Â  Ex parte\r\n    Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 65, 624 S.E.2d 649, 654 (2006).Â  â€œAny unappealed\r\n  portion of the trial courtâ€™s judgment is law of the case and must be affirmed.â€\r\n  Â Rumpf v. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 386, 398, 593\r\n  S.E.2d 183, 189 (Ct. App. 2004); see also ML-Lee Acquisition Fund,\r\n    L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 327 S.C. 238, 241, 489 S.E.2d 470, 472\r\n  (1997) (emphasizing that unappealed rulings become law of case and should not\r\n  be reconsidered by this court).\r\nAs noted by the\r\n  trial court on remand and acknowledged by counsel for both sides during oral\r\n  argument for the present appeal, Prince raised the issue of waiver to the trial\r\n  court when he sought to obtain the Quality Assurance Committee file.Â  After the\r\n  trial, Prince appealed to this Court, raising the following five issues:\r\n \r\n\r\n\t(1)Â \r\n  Did the [trial] court err in granting the Hospital Section 40-71-10 &amp; 20\r\n  privileges of confidentiality regarding the incident reports without requiring\r\n  proof that the Section applies? (2) Did the [trial] court err in denying the [Prince]\r\n  his statement made the night of the incident?Â  (3)Â  Did the court erred [sic]\r\n  when it found that the [Hospital] was a â€œpeerâ€ appearing before itself and\r\n  being reviewed by itself, thereby qualifying for the privilege of\r\n  confidentiality.Â  (4)Â  Did the [trial] court err in not reviewing the\r\n  Hospitalâ€™s â€œallegedâ€ confidential file [i]n [c]amera to resolve\r\n  conflicts in evidence resulting from discovery responses summarized by the\r\n  Respondent from the alleged confidential file and witness testimony?Â  (5)Â  Did\r\n  the trial court err in not granting the Princeâ€™s JNOV?\r\n\r\nWe do not read any of these\r\n  issues to include an argument on the issue of waiver.Â  In addition, we have\r\n  reviewed the brief Prince filed in the prior appeal of this case, which was\r\n  included in the record compiled for the present appeal, and have found nothing\r\n  that addresses the issue of waiver.Â  We therefore hold Prince failed to appeal\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s refusal to consider his argument that Hospital had waived its\r\n  protection under section 40-71-20.Â  See Rule 207(b)(1)(B) (â€œOrdinarily,\r\n  no point will be considered which is not set forth in the statement of the\r\n  issues on appeal.â€).\r\nIn making this determination, we further hold the\r\n  trial court erred in stating the issue of waiver was â€œso\r\n  intertwined with the issue of confidentiality of the file that it was inherently\r\n  preserved for review.â€ Â â€œWaiver is defined as\r\n  an intentional relinquishment of a known right.â€Â  Lawrimore v.\r\n    American Health &amp; Life Ins. Co., 276 S.C. 112, 114, 276 S.E.2d 296, 297\r\n  (1981) (emphasis added).Â  It follows that one seeking to establish a waiver of\r\n  confidentiality inherently recognizes the confidential nature of the\r\n  information being sought.[2]Â  \r\n \r\n2.Â  We further\r\n  agree with Hospital that the trial court, in finding Hospital had waived the\r\n  right to invoke section 40-17-20, had exceeded the scope of authority granted\r\n  by this Court in its prior opinion.\r\nOnce\r\n  this Court issues a mandate to a trial court, the trial court â€œis vested with\r\n  jurisdiction only to the extent conferred by the appellate courtâ€™s opinion and\r\n  mandate.â€ Â S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Basnight,&nbsp; 346 S.C. 241,\r\n  250-251, 551 S.E.2d 274, 279&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001) (quoting 5 Am. Jur. 2d Appellate\r\n    Review Â§ 784, at 43 (1995)).Â  â€œIt is\r\n  the duty of the trial court to follow the decision of the appellate court.â€Â  Ackerman\r\n    v. McMillan, 324 S.C. 440, 443, 477 S.E.2d 267, 268 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Thus,\r\n  it is error for a trial court to consider an issue that was not included in the\r\n  remand instructions.Â  Id.  \r\nFollowing\r\n  a remand, the trial court acquires jurisdiction to enforce the judgment and\r\n  take any action consistent with this Courtâ€™s ruling.Â  Id.Â  â€œMatters\r\n  decided by the appellate court cannot be reheard, reconsidered, or relitigated\r\n  in the trial court, even under the guise of a different form.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nIn\r\n  the present case, this Court previously concluded Hospitalâ€™s Quality Assurance\r\n  Committee was within the purview of section 40-71-10 to the extent the\r\n  committee operated pursuant to bylaws approved by Hospital.Â  Nevertheless, the trial court was\r\n  specifically instructed to examine the Quality Assurance Committee file to\r\n  determine if it â€œwarrants confidentialityâ€ and if there was â€œany evidence not\r\n  protected by the confidentiality statute.â€ Â When conducting the in camera\r\n  review, however, the trial court went beyond the remand instructions to find\r\n  that Hospital â€œwaived its privilege to claim the confidentiality of the Quality\r\n  Assurance [F[ile.â€\r\nWe recognize that this Court in its prior opinion stated that\r\n  â€œ[i]n camera reviews should be used liberally to guard against even a mere\r\n  possibility a miscarriage of justice will occur,â€ and directed the trial court\r\n  to use its discretion when reviewing the file.Â  Nevertheless, for the reasons\r\n  we stated in the preceding section of this opinion, we hold the remand\r\n  instructions did not authorize the trial court to consider whether Hospital had\r\n  waived its right to assert the file was confidential. Â The possibility that such\r\n  a privilege may have been waived does not affect a determination of whether or\r\n  not the evidence in the file was protected under section 40-71-20 in the first\r\n  place.Â   \r\n3.Â  In reviewing the appealed\r\n  order in this case, we note the trial court, in addition to finding Hospital\r\n  had waived the protections of section 40-71-20, concluded â€œthe committee file\r\n  does contain relevant evidence that is not protected by the confidentiality\r\n  statute.â€Â  The order, however, does not describe the evidence or explain why it\r\n  is not protected by section 40-71-20.Â  Accordingly, we remand the matter to the\r\n  trial court to set forth the specific portions of the Quality Assurance\r\n  Committee file that are subject to discovery as well as the reasons these\r\n  portions are not confidential under section 40-71-20.\r\n4.Â  Based on our disposition\r\n  of this appeal, we do not address Hospitalâ€™s remaining argument concerning\r\n  whether its disclosure of certain information under Rule 33, SCRCP, in fact\r\n  constituted a waiver of the protection of section 40-17-20.Â  See Futch\r\n    v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d\r\n  591, 598 (1999) (ruling an appellate court need not review remaining issues\r\n  when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the trial\r\n  court, in reviewing the Quality Assurance Committee file pursuant to this\r\n  Courtâ€™s prior opinion, exceeded its authority in finding Hospital had waived\r\n  its right to invoke the protections of South Carolina Code section 40-71-20.Â \r\n  The issue of waiver was neither raised in the prior appeal nor mentioned by\r\n  this Court when it decided the matter.Â  Nevertheless, because the trial court\r\n  on remand found â€œthe committee file does contain relevant evidence that is not\r\n  protected by the confidentiality statute,â€ we again remand the matter to the\r\n  trial court to set forth the evidence in the file that is subject to discovery\r\n  and to explain why, consistent with the language in this Courtâ€™s prior opinion,\r\n  this evidence â€œis not protected by the confidentiality statute.â€\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., KITTREDGE and THOMAS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1]Â  South Carolina Code section 40-71-10 exempts members\r\n  of certain professional committees from tort liability.Â  S.C.

Brackett, of York, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  Dominique Donte Moore (Moore) was convicted of possession with\r\n  intent to distribute (PWID) crack cocaine.Â  He received a twenty-five year\r\n  sentence and a fine of $50,000.Â  Moore argues the court erred in admitting into\r\n  evidence money seized from his person and related testimony.Â  We affirm. [1]\r\nFACTS\r\nAt\r\n  2:30 AM, April 25, 2006, an officer with the Rock Hill Police Department\r\n  stopped Mooreâ€™s vehicle for violation of a noise ordinance.Â  After exhibiting\r\n  what the officer considered suspicious behavior, Moore was asked to step out of\r\n  the car.Â  The officer observed Moore holding a plastic bag in his hand, which\r\n  he dropped during a struggle.Â  The bag contained 1.07 grams of crack cocaine.Â \r\n  Another .06 grams were found in Mooreâ€™s back pocket.Â  No additional drugs or\r\n  paraphernalia were found in a search of Mooreâ€™s car, but $1,362 in cash was\r\n  seized from his person.Â  The cash consisted of six $100 bills, thirty $20\r\n  bills, ten $10 bills, six $5 bills, and thirty-two $1 bills. Â After receiving\r\n  his Miranda rights, Moore told the officers he did not use crack.Â  When\r\n  asked if he sold it, Moore answered, â€œI do what I have to do to get by.â€Â  With Moore in custody, he refused to sign the money over to the police. Â He later told them the\r\n  money was not his, though he refused to say to whom it belonged.Â  Later still,\r\n  he said it was his motherâ€™s money.Â  The State then listed her name on the\r\n  consent order of forfeiture.\r\nIn a\r\n  pretrial motion to suppress, Moore contended the money should not be admitted\r\n  because (1) no evidence linked or traced it to any illegal drug activity; (2)\r\n  assuming the money was traceable to illegal drug activity, no evidence traced\r\n  it to the particular drugs in this case; and (3) the State, by naming Mooreâ€™s\r\n  mother the owner in the consent order for forfeiture, was collaterally estopped\r\n  from arguing the money belonged to Moore.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  support of the admission of the money, the State presented evidence that crack\r\n  cocaine is typically sold in $20 rocks, though sales may be in larger amounts\r\n  for more money.Â  Additionally, the State asserted the evidence was more\r\n  relevant because of Mooreâ€™s unemployment.Â  The State argued the consent order\r\n  was irrelevant to the case and unrelated to any connection between the money\r\n  and drugs.  \r\nThe\r\n  trial judge ruled the evidence of the $20 bills would be admissible if an\r\n  officer testified a single crack cocaine rock typically sells for $20.Â  Without\r\n  further testimony, however, the other money did not constitute circumstantial\r\n  evidence and would not be admitted.Â  Concerning the forfeiture order, the trial\r\n  judge said the State would have been wise to name both the mother and Moore,\r\n  but doing so would have gone against the motherâ€™s consent.Â  From the record, it\r\n  appears the mother claimed she loaned the money to Moore.Â  Because the mother\r\n  â€œdidnâ€™t completely say it was her money,â€ the trial judge reasoned it was Mooreâ€™s money but subject to repayment.Â  Neither party made further motions at the\r\n  suppression hearing.Â  At trial, an officer submitted that crack cocaine rocks\r\n  usually sell for $20 and, over Mooreâ€™s objections, the officer told of the $20\r\n  bills found during the arrest.Â  After the close of the Stateâ€™s evidence, the\r\n  court denied Mooreâ€™s directed verdict motion.\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases,\r\n  the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Wilson,\r\n  345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001); State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 520, 608\r\n  S.E.2d 435 (Ct. App. 2004); State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 575 S.E.2d\r\n  852 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  This court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings\r\n  in determining the admissibility of certain evidence in criminal cases.Â  Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.Â  The admission of evidence is within the\r\n  discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 207, 631 S.E.2d 262, 265\r\n  (2006); State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 557, 564 S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002); State\r\n    v. Cherry, 353 S.C. 263, 272-73, 577 S.E.2d 719, 723 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  An\r\n  abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of the trial court either lack\r\n  evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of law.Â  Pagan, 369\r\n  S.C. at 208, 631 S.E.2d at 265; State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 540\r\n  S.E.2d 464 (2000); State v. Walker, 366 S.C. 643, 623 S.E.2d 122 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005).Â  In order for an error of law to warrant reversal, the error must\r\n  result in prejudice to the appellant.Â  State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 536\r\n  S.E.2d 679 (2000); State v. Wyatt, 317 S.C. 370, 453 S.E.2d 890 (1995); State\r\n    v. Patterson, 367 S.C. 219, 625 S.E.2d 239 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nMoore argues the trial court erred in admitting into\r\n  evidence money seized from his person upon arrest and related testimony because\r\n  the money was irrelevant and prejudicial under Rule 403, SCRE.Â   \r\nSection\r\n  44-53-375(B) of the South Carolina Code â€œcreates a permissive inference that\r\n  possession of more than one gram of crack cocaine constitutes possession with\r\n  intent to distribute.â€Â  State v. Robinson, 344 S.C. 220, 223, 543 S.E.2d\r\n  249, 250 (Ct. App. 2001); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(B) (2002).Â  â€œPossession of\r\n  any amount of controlled substance coupled with sufficient indicia of intent to\r\n  distribute will support a conviction for possession with intent to\r\n  distribute.â€Â  State v. James, 362 S.C. 557, 561-62, 608 S.E.2d 455, 457\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004), cert. dismissed, Op. No. 26393 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Nov. 19, 2007) (Shearouse Ad. Sh. No. 40 at 16), (quoting Matthews v. State,\r\n  300 S.C. 238, 239, 387 S.E.2d 258, 259 (1990)).\r\nThe\r\n  trial court based its decision to admit the evidence on State v. Cherry,\r\n  353 S.C. 263, 577 S.E.2d 719 (Ct. App. 2001), a case where money found on the\r\n  defendant upon arrest was relevant evidence supporting a PWID crack cocaine\r\n  conviction.Â  Although Moore states the facts of Cherry are distinguishable\r\n  from those in this case, there is a strong parallel.Â   \r\nIn Cherry,\r\n  the defendant was a passenger in a car stopped for two traffic violations.Â  A\r\n  pat-down search revealed eight crack cocaine rocks and $322.Â  Cherry was\r\n  charged with PWID crack cocaine.Â  During an in limine motion,\r\n  Cherry attempted to suppress the money arguing it was irrelevant.Â  The State\r\n  countered the money was relevant to show intent to sell the crack cocaine on\r\n  his person because it commonly sold for $20 per rock. Â The trial judge\r\n  refrained from ruling on admissibility until hearing testimony.Â  Over Cherryâ€™s\r\n  objection to the money testimony, the arresting officer told the court no drug\r\n  paraphernalia was found in the car, the stop was made in a high crime area, the\r\n  money found on Cherry was mostly $20 bills, and crack cocaine is generally sold\r\n  in $20 rocks.Â  Â The court denied Cherryâ€™s motion for a directed verdict finding\r\n  the evidence was sufficient to submit the case to the jury.Â  On appeal, Cherry\r\n  complained of error in overruling his objection. Â This Court agreed with the\r\n  State that the money was admissible instructing:\r\n\r\n\tEvidence\r\n  is relevant, and therefore admissible, when it tends to make the existence of a\r\n  fact in controversy more or less probable than it would be without the\r\n  evidence.Â  Rule 401, SCRE.Â  The money was relevant to the contested question of\r\n  whether Cherry intended to distribute the crack rocks in his possession.Â  In\r\n  light of the officerâ€™s testimony regarding the price of crack rocks, the $322\r\n  in mostly twenties was some indication that Cherry had sold crack earlier in\r\n  the evening and thus, its admission into evidence tended to make the allegation\r\n  he intended to distribute the crack in his watch pocket more probable.Â  The\r\n  money was properly admitted.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 274, 577 S.E.2d at 724.\r\nIn a divided review, this Court again affirmed Cherry's conviction\r\n  relying, in part, on the money as supporting evidence.Â  State v. Cherry,\r\n  348 S.C. 281, 559 S.E.2d 297 (Ct. App. 2001) (en banc), affâ€™d in\r\n    result, 361 S.C. 588, 606 S.E.2d 475 (2004). Â â€œ[T]he majority opinion found the following evidence\r\n  justified the trial court's decision to deny Cherry's motion for a directed\r\n  verdict: (1) Cherry was arrested in high crime area known for violence and drug\r\n  activity; (2) Cherry had in his possession a small bag containing eight rocks\r\n  of crack cocaine; (3) he had no drug paraphernalia with him indicating the\r\n  crack cocaine was for his personal consumption; (4) he had $322 in cash, in mostly twenty dollar bills; and (5) a single rock\r\n  of crack cocaine typically sold for twenty dollars.â€Â  State v. James,\r\n  362 S.C. 557, 564, 608 S.E.2d 455, 458 (Ct. App. 2004) (emphasis added) (citing Cherry, 348 S.C. at 285, 559 S.E.2d at 299); see also State\r\n    v. Elmore, 368 S.C. 230, 628 S.E.2d 271 (Ct. App. 2006) cert. denied Apr. 5, 2007 (trial court properly denied directed verdict motion on charge of PWID\r\n  marijuana where search found numerous baggies of marijuana in defendantâ€™s car,\r\n  no marijuana residue or paraphernalia, and $653 cash on person); cf. James,\r\n  362 S.C. 557, 608 S.E.2d 455 (Ct. App. 2004) (insufficient evidence to submit\r\n  to jury charge of PWID crack cocaine where, inter alia, defendant\r\n  did not have a large amount of cash on his person, and amount of crack\r\n  speculative because bag seen only briefly by officer and never recovered for\r\n  testing).\r\nMoore, who carried $1,362 in\r\n  cash consisting of six $100 bills, thirty $20 bills, ten $10 bills, six $5\r\n  bills, and thirty-two $1 bills, claims the mixed denominations removes his case\r\n  from the ambit of Cherry.Â  We disagree.Â  Here, Moore carried $600 in $20\r\n  bills.Â  The relevance of this sizable amount is not diluted by the significant\r\n  amount held in other denominations.Â  Because the money was relevant evidence,\r\n  analysis of whether Moore was prejudiced is unwarranted.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  his brief, Moore averred the purpose of admitting the money was to indicate Moore sold crack earlier in the evening, and prior sales would constitute other bad acts\r\n  requiring a clear and convincing standard of proof.Â  This argument was not presented\r\n  to the trial judge and is not preserved for our review.Â  â€œArguments not raised or\r\n  ruled upon by the trial court are not preserved for appellate review.â€Â  State\r\n    v. Carlson, 363 S.C. 586, 597, 611 S.E.2d 283, 288 (Ct. App. 2005); State\r\n      v. Wise, 359 S.C. 14, 596 S.E.2d 475 (2004); State v. Perez, 334\r\n  S.C. 563, 514 S.E.2d 754 (1999).\r\nMoore contends the State should be collaterally estopped\r\n  from introducing the money into evidence because\r\n  the consent order of forfeiture named Mooreâ€™s mother as the owner. Â This\r\n  argument fails.Â  â€œ[C]ollateral estoppel prevents a party\r\n  from relitigating in a subsequent suit an issue actually and necessarily\r\n  litigated and determined in a prior action.â€Â Â  Koon v. State, 358 S.C.\r\n  359, 364-65, 595 S.E.2d 456, 459 (2004) (overruled on other grounds by State\r\n    v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005)) (citing Jinks v. Richland\r\n      County, 355 S.C. 341, 585 S.E.2d 281 (2003)).Â  â€œIn order to successfully\r\n  assert collateral estoppel, the party seeking issue preclusion must show that\r\n  the issue was actually litigated and directly determined in the prior action,\r\n  and that the matter or fact directly in issue was necessary to support the\r\n  first judgment.â€Â  Town of Sullivanâ€™s Island v. Felger, 318 S.C. 340,\r\n  344, 457 S.E.2d 626, 628 (Ct. App. 1995).Â   \r\nMoore has\r\n  offered no precedent showing a civil forfeiture proceeding may be defensively\r\n  asserted to have a binding effect on a subsequent criminal trial.Â  The law of South Carolina is clear: â€œ[O]nce a person has been criminally convicted he is bound by that\r\n  adjudication in a subsequent civil proceeding based on the same facts\r\n  underlying the criminal conviction.â€Â  Doe v. Doe, 346 S.C. 145, 148, 551\r\n  S.E.2d 257, 258 (2001).Â  Whereas a criminal convictionâ€™s greater degree of\r\n  proof justifies utilization of collateral estoppel in later civil actions, the\r\n  logic does not apply when applied in reverse.Â  â€œ[W]hen a conviction is offered\r\n  in a civil proceeding against the party convicted, the party cannot complain of\r\n  a difference in the degree of proof when the burden of proof in the criminal\r\n  proceeding was much higher than the burden of proof in the present civil\r\n  proceeding.â€Â  Id. at 149, 551 S.E.2d at 259; see also Crum\r\n    &amp; Forster Ins.

Finger, of Hilton Head Island, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tOtto W. Ferrene, Jr., of Hilton Head Island, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Â Danna Cooper\r\n  Brissie appeals from an order by the Master-in-Equity which, inter alia,\r\n  granted an injunction to the Palmetto Bay Club Owners Association (Palmetto Bay).Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nThis matter arises out of a dispute over a condominium unit (Penthouse)\r\n  located in the Palmetto Bay Club on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.Â  All of the condominium units are subject to the Master\r\n  Deed (Deed) and Bylaws of Palmetto Bay. Â Penthouse was originally designed as\r\n  two separate condominium units, 504 and 505; however during construction,\r\n  prospective buyers Jim and Tammy Faye Baker indicated they were interested in a\r\n  penthouse unit combining the two condominiums.Â  As a result, Penthouse is unique\r\n  among Palmetto Bay units, because units 504 and 505 were united when Penthouse\r\n  was completed without a wall separating the two. Â Because it was constructed as\r\n  separate units, Penthouse has duplicates of certain unit features, including\r\n  two utility meters, breaker panels, mailboxes, kitchen areas, balconies, washer\r\n  and dryer connections, water heaters, heating and air conditioning systems,\r\n  refrigerator connections and parking spaces. Â \r\nBrissie\r\n  originally purchased Penthouse from Helen Valois in 1994.Â  Brissie sold Penthouse\r\n  to her sister in 1998 and subsequently re-purchased it in 2001.Â  During Brissieâ€™s\r\n  first ownership period, she erected an interior wall between the two units\r\n  comprising Penthouse. Â Brissie was notified by the property management company[1] for Palmetto Bay that under the Deed and Bylaws, her alterations to the building\r\n  required advance approval from the Associationâ€™s Board of Directors (Board). Â Additionally,\r\n  the management company also sent Brissie a copy of Palmetto Bayâ€™s Deed. Â Brissie dismantled the wall in June of 1997. Â \r\nUpon\r\n  re-purchasing Penthouse in 2001 from her sister, Brissie sent a letter to\r\n  Valois, who was then President of the Board, indicating Brissieâ€™s plans to\r\n  alter the Penthouse. Â In her letter, Brissie requested Valois share her plans\r\n  with the Board and indicated Brissie would assume alterations could be made if\r\n  the Board did not respond within thirty days. Â When the Board did not respond,\r\n  Brissie erected a portion of a wall and completed a second kitchen in one of\r\n  the units of the Penthouse. Â Furthermore, Brissie replaced an existing set of\r\n  French doors which had divided the units since the time of Valoisâ€™ ownership of\r\n  the Penthouse, with a smaller lock-out door system, similar to those found\r\n  between connecting hotel rooms. Â Thereafter, Palmetto Bay instructed her to\r\n  cease alterations to Penthouse and return the Penthouse to its original\r\n  condition. Â When Brissie refused, Palmetto Bay filed this action for an\r\n  injunction and attorneyâ€™s fees. Â \r\nThe master\r\n  found an ambiguity existed in the Deed, created by the plans which were\r\n  attached and incorporated into the Deed. Â These plans show a solid wall with no\r\n  opening or doorway connecting the two units.Â  The master nevertheless found the\r\n  alterations Brissie made to Penthouse violated Palmetto Bayâ€™s Deed and Bylaws.Â \r\n  Furthermore, the master found the letter sent to Valois from Brissie failed to\r\n  provide the Board with adequate notice as required by the Deed and Bylaws. Â The\r\n  issue of attorneyâ€™s fees was held in abeyance until a further hearing could be\r\n  conducted. Â Brissie subsequently filed a motion to alter or amend which\r\n  was denied.Â  This appeal followed.  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhether\r\n  the action is one at law or in equity is determined by the nature of the\r\n  pleadings and the character of the relief sought.Â  In re Estate of Holden,\r\n  343 S.C. 267, 278, 539 S.E.2d 703, 709&nbsp;(2000).Â  The interpretation of a\r\n  deed and an action to enforce restrictive covenants by injunction are both\r\n  equitable matters. South Carolina Dept. of Natural Resources v. Town of\r\n    McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 622, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302&nbsp;(2001); Eldridge\r\n      v. Greenwood,&nbsp;331 S.C. 398, 416, 503 S.E.2d 191, 200&nbsp;(Ct. App.\r\n  1998).\r\nIn an action in equity, tried by a master without a\r\n  jury, this court may view the evidence to determine facts in accordance with\r\n  its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Â McClellanville 345\r\n  S.C. at 622, 550 S.E.2d at 302.Â  On appeal, we are to consider the equities of\r\n  both sides, balancing the two to determine what, if any, relief to give.Â  Anderson v. Buonforte, 365 S.C. 482, 493, 617 S.E.2d 750, 755 (Ct. App. 2005).Â \r\n  When reviewing the findings of fact in an equitable action, this court will not\r\n  disturb findings of fact which are sufficiently supported by the evidence. Â Parrot\r\n    v. Dickson Hall v. Walker, 151 S.C. 114, 120, 148 S.E. 704, 706 (1929). \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBrissie contends\r\n  the master erred in finding the plain and obvious purpose of the Deed was\r\n  defeated by installing a lock-out door system in the Penthouse.Â  We agree.\r\nIn the present\r\n  case, a document incorporated into the Deed as Exhibit B, describes the Penthouse\r\n  as a â€œB/Câ€ unit.Â  The Deed also offers a narrative description of each unit in\r\n  Exhibit C; however, although â€œUnit Type Bâ€, and â€œUnit Type Câ€ are each\r\n  described separately, no explanation or description exists for a B/C unit.Â  Moreover,\r\n  the Deed provides in Article II, Section 2, that â€œ[t]he Units are of the\r\n  general design as graphically depicted in the certified architectâ€™s plans which\r\n  are compiled and annexed to this Master Deed at Exhibit F.â€Â   \r\nThe master found\r\n  that â€œthe Master Deed has an ambiguity.â€Â  He based this finding on the fact\r\n  that, although Article II, Section 2 of the Deed states that Palmetto Bay is\r\n  limited to a total of fifty-nine condominium units, the plans for Palmetto Bay\r\n  attached to the Deed show Unit 504/505 being divided by a one-hour firewall.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the master found that â€œthe ambiguity is created by the fact that\r\n  the drawing shows the unit as being divided by a wall.â€Â  Â No appeal was taken\r\n  from this finding of an ambiguity; as such, it is the law of the case. Â Resolution\r\n    Trust Corp. v. Eagle Lake &amp; Golf Condominiums, 310 S.C. 473, 476, 427\r\n  S.E.2d 646, 648 (1993) (the trial judgeâ€™s procedural ruling is the law of the\r\n  case since it has not been appealed); See also Toal, Vafai, and\r\n  Muckenfuss, Appellate Practice in South Carolina 80 (2d ed. 2002) (â€œIt is a\r\n  fundamental rule of law that an appellate court will affirm a ruling by a lower\r\n  court if the offended party does not challenge that rulingâ€).\r\nRestrictive\r\n  covenants, like the ones at issue in the Palmetto Bay Deed and Bylaws, are\r\n  subject to the rules of contract construction. Houck v. Rivers, 316 S.C.\r\n  414, 416, 450 S.E.2d 106, 108 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  Historically, restrictions on\r\n  the use of property are disfavored in the law.Â  Sea Pines Plantation\r\n    Co. v. Wells, 294 S.C. 266, 270, 363 S.E.2d 891, 893 (1987).Â  Accordingly,\r\n  courts interpret restrictive covenants strictly and resolve any doubt or\r\n  ambiguity in the covenants in favor of the free and unrestricted use of land.Â  Hyer\r\n    v. McRee, 306 S.C. 210, 212, 410 S.E.2d 604, 605 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  We agree\r\n  with the master that the Deed is ambiguous because of the drawings attached to\r\n  it which depicted a solid wall separating unit 504 and 505.Â  However, once the\r\n  master found an ambiguity existed, he should have construed that ambiguity in\r\n  favor of Brissieâ€™s right to use her property without restriction.[2]\r\nAlthough an\r\n  ambiguity is found, a court should not use the rule of strict construction to\r\n  defeat the plain and obvious purpose of the restrictive covenants.Â  Hardy v.\r\n    Aiken, 369 S.C. 160, 166, 631 S.E.2d 539, 542 (2006).Â  Here however, both\r\n  the Deed and the Bylaws provide procedures for the modification or alteration\r\n  of individual units.Â  These include notice to the Board through an agent or the\r\n  President of the Board, and provide a time period in which the Board has to\r\n  reply. Â Therefore, construing the ambiguity before us to allow Brissie to\r\n  replace a large set of French doors with a lock-out door system and partial\r\n  wall to fill in the remaining space, does not defeat the plain and obvious\r\n  purpose of the restrictive covenants.Â  Â Â \r\nBrissie puts forth several additional issues in her\r\n  appeal from the masterâ€™s order, including the argument that she provided\r\n  adequate notice to the Board of her intention to install the lock-out door in\r\n  her letter to the Boardâ€™s president.Â  Brissie contends that when the Board did\r\n  not respond to her letter within the applicable period, permission was granted under\r\n  the Bylaws.Â  Because we find the\r\n  determination of the issue above to be dispositive in the appeal before us, we\r\n  need not review Brissieâ€™s remaining contentions.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518\r\n    S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue\r\n  is dispositive of the appeal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n  Based on the foregoing, we hold the master erred in granting Palmetto Bayâ€™s request for an injunction.Â  The issue of attorneyâ€™s fees is remanded to the\r\n  master for disposition in light of our opinion.Â  The decision of the master is\r\n  accordingly\r\nREVERSED and\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Two companies, New Leaf Management Inc. and Allied\r\n  Management Group, have served as the property manager for Palmetto Bay during the periods in which Brissie owned Penthouse. Â \r\n[2] It is undisputed that Brissieâ€™s installation of the\r\n  interior lock-out door had no effect on the common areas of Palmetto Bay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-141","title":"One Hundred Eighth Cookingham, Inc. v.

Herring of Hilton Head Island and William Weston Jones Newton, of Bluffton, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  David\r\n  and Julia Miller and Julia Millerâ€™s sons from a prior marriage, Alan and Andrew\r\n  Hagemaster (collectively the Hagemasters), appeal an order setting aside certain\r\n  property transfers as fraudulent pursuant to the Statute of Elizabeth.Â  We\r\n  affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn September 24, 2001, the Millers purchased a condominium in\r\n  Village West in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.Â  The purchase price for the\r\n  condominium was $300,000, the entirety of which was paid by David Miller from\r\n  his own funds.Â  According to the Millers, Julia Miller was to receive the\r\n  property as compensation for relinquishing a tenured position with the University of Kansas when she married David in April 2001; however, the deed to the\r\n  condominium listed the Millers as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\r\nOn June 27, 2002, One Hundred Eighth Cookingham, Inc., a Missouri corporation, filed a demand for arbitration against David, a Kansas resident, with\r\n  the American Arbitration Association at its office in Kansas City, Missouri.Â  In the demand, Cookingham claimed $1,337,400 in damages for breach of a real\r\n  estate and option contract, plus costs and expenses.Â  The date of the alleged\r\n  breach was July 1, 1997.Â  On June 26, 2003, the arbitrator awarded Cookingham\r\n  $789,039 plus costs, finding all issues in favor of Cookingham.\r\nBy quitclaim deed dated July 25, 2003, and recorded on July 30,\r\n  2003, in the Office of the Register of Deeds for Beaufort County, South Carolina, David and Julia transferred the condominium to Julia for no consideration.Â \r\n  In addition, by deed dated July 25, 2003, and recorded July 31, 2003, Julia\r\n  deeded the condominium to the Hagemasters for no consideration, reserving a\r\n  life estate for herself and David.\r\nOn December 23, 2003, the arbitratorâ€™s award was enrolled in the\r\n  circuit court of Clay County, Missouri, as a final judgment.Â  Thereafter, on\r\n  February 16, 2005, the Missouri judgment was enrolled in the Beaufort Court of\r\n  Common Pleas as a South Carolina judgment.\r\nIn 2005, Cookingham petitioned the Beaufort County Court of Common\r\n  Pleas to set aside the conveyances pursuant to the Statute of Elizabeth.Â  The\r\n  trial court set aside both the 2001 grant of a one-half interest in the\r\n  property to Julia and Davidâ€™s subsequent conveyance in 2003 of his half\r\n  interest in the property.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAn\r\n  action to set aside a transfer of land as fraudulent pursuant to the Statute of\r\n  Elizabeth is an action in equity.â€Â  Albertson v. Robinson, 371, S.C.\r\n  311, 315, 638 S.E.2d 81, 83 (Ct. App. 2006) (citing Future Group, II v.\r\n    Nationsbank, 324 S.C. 89, 97 n.6, 478 S.E.2d 45, 49 n.6 (1996)).Â  In an\r\n  action in equity tried without a reference, the appellate court may find facts\r\n  in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Â Townes\r\n    Assoc., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775-76\r\n  (1976).Â  Notwithstanding this broad scope of review, however, the appellate\r\n  court does not disregard the findings of fact by the trial judge, â€œwho saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better\r\n  position to evaluate their credibility.â€Â  Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher-Agro, Inc.,\r\n  301 S.C. 229, 237, 311 S.E.2d 538, 53 (1989).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  The Millers and the\r\n  Hagemasters argue the Statute of Elizabeth cannot be used to set aside the conveyances\r\n  at issue because both the initial acquisition of the condominium by David and\r\n  Julia Miller and the subsequent transfer of Davidâ€™s interest to Julia were\r\n  supported by valuable consideration.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder\r\n  the Statute of Elizabeth, a transfer of real property made to prevent a\r\n  creditor from collecting on a debt â€œmust be deemed and taken . . . to be\r\n  clearly and utterly void, frustrate and of no effect, any pretense, color,\r\n  feigned consideration, expressing of use, or any other matter or thing to the\r\n  contrary notwithstanding.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-23-10(A) (2007).Â   \r\nA conveyance\r\n  may be set aside as fraudulent under the Statute of Elizabeth if it was voluntary\r\n  or if there is actual intent to defraud the grantorâ€™s creditors.Â  Royal Z Lanes,\r\n    Inc. v. Collins Holding Corp., 337 S.C. 592, 595, 524 S.E.2d 621, 622\r\n  (1999).Â  A voluntary conveyance is a gratuitous transfer of property or one\r\n  without valuable consideration.Â  Id. at 594-95, 524 S.E.2d at 622.Â  To\r\n  set aside a voluntary conveyance, a creditor must establish the following:Â  (1)\r\n  the grantor was indebted to the creditor at the time of the transfer; (2) the\r\n  conveyance was voluntary; and (3) the grantor failed to retain sufficient\r\n  property to pay the indebtedness to the creditor in full, not merely at the\r\n  time of transfer, but in the final analysis when the creditor seeks to collect\r\n  the debt.Â  Mathis v. Burton, 319 S.C. 261, 265, 460 S.E.2d 406, 408 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1995).Â   \r\nThe\r\n  Millers and the Hagemasters contend the transfers that One Hundred Eighth\r\n  Cookingham sought to invalidate were supported by valuable consideration,\r\n  namely, the $300,000 in income that Julia purportedly forfeited in order to\r\n  marry David.Â  In support of their argument, they cite their uncontradicted testimony\r\n  that (1) the sole purpose of acquiring the condominium was to induce Julia to\r\n  marry David and to compensate her for the income she forfeited in so doing; and\r\n  (2) the initial deed giving title to both David and Julia was an oversight and only\r\n  Julia should have received title to the property.  \r\nNotwithstanding\r\n  the absence of evidence discrediting their statements, the Millers failed to\r\n  carry their burden of establishing both valuable consideration and the bona\r\n  fides of the transfer by clear and convincing evidence.Â  See Gardner v. Kirven, 184 S.C. 37, 41, 191 S.E. 814, 816 (1936) (â€œWhere transfers to members of the family are attacked\r\n  either upon the ground of actual fraud or on account of their voluntary\r\n  character, the law imposes the burden on the transferee to establish both a\r\n  valuable consideration and the bona fides of the transaction by\r\n  clear and convincing testimony.â€).Â  The trial court specifically found the\r\n  Millers lacked credibility and gave sound reasons for this finding.Â  These\r\n  reasons included the following:Â  (1) it was illogical that Julia, having been\r\n  advised in early 2001 about her grave medical prognosis, would not make the\r\n  certain the condominium was properly titled solely in her name in accordance\r\n  with the purported agreement; (2) the Millersâ€™ assertion that they never\r\n  discussed Davidâ€™s business difficulties was questionable considering their\r\n  demonstrated â€œability and willingness to discuss potentially touchy subjects at\r\n  some depth during their discussions about the marriageâ€ and the timing of the\r\n  demand for arbitration vis-Ã -vis that of the arbitration hearing; (3) the\r\n  Millersâ€™ contention that it was only when Julia learned she was cancer-free, which\r\n  was coincidentally during the same months the arbitration proceeding was\r\n  pending, that they realized their supposed agreement would be upset if she\r\n  pre-deceased David; and (4) Juliaâ€™s testimony that her sons had no knowledge of\r\n  Davidâ€™s difficulties and no knowledge of the conveyance of the condominium to\r\n  them actually supported a finding that this subsequent conveyance was not a\r\n  bona fide transfer.Â  These reasons also support the trial courtâ€™s finding that\r\n  the Millers did not enter into any agreement before their marriage under which\r\n  David was to purchase property and title it in Juliaâ€™s name as consideration\r\n  for her loss of income from taking early retirement.\r\n2.Â  The Millers and the Hagemasters also argue Julia was an\r\n  innocent purchaser without knowledge of any indebtedness to Cookingham.Â  Specifically,\r\n  they contend that â€œ[b]y accepting the deed(s) to the subject property, Julia\r\n  Miller merely was exercising her own right to the property in accordance with\r\n  the contract she had with her husband; a contract upon which she fully\r\n  performed.â€Â  Because, however, we uphold the trial courtâ€™s finding that there\r\n  was no such contract, we do not address this argument.Â  See Futch v.\r\n    McAllister Towing of Georgetown, 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598\r\n  (1999) (explaining an appellate court need not address remaining issues when its\r\n  decision concerning prior issues is dispositive of the case).\r\n3.Â  We also reject the\r\n  contention of the Millers and the Hagemasters that David that the Statute of\r\n  Elizabeth is inapplicable to this case because David was not a debtor of Cookingham\r\n  at the time of the initial acquisition of the condominium.Â  The inception of\r\n  the debt or obligation controls rather than the date of the subsequent entry of\r\n  judgment.Â  Matthews v. Montgomery, 193 S.C. 118, 133, 7 S.E.2d 841, 848\r\n  (1940).Â  Moreover, as the supreme court stated in Matthews, â€œIt is only\r\n  necessary that the debt should have been in existence or the right of action\r\n  have accrued at or before the time of the transfer. It may be reduced to\r\n  judgment at a later date.â€ Â Id.; see also Albertson, 371\r\n  S.C. at 317-18, 638 S.E.2d at 84 (setting aside the conveyance of a marital\r\n  home from a debtor to his wife pursuant to the Statute of Elizabeth and holding\r\n  the pivotal event was when the debtor breached his contract with the party\r\n  seeking to invalidate the transfer rather than the entry of judgment against\r\n  him). Â \r\nIn\r\n  the present case, David became indebted to Cookingham when he breached the\r\n  contract in 1997.Â  The acquisition of the condominium and the transfers at\r\n  issue here did not occur until 2001 and 2003, several years after the breach.Â \r\n  We therefore hold Cookingham had obtained creditorâ€™s status at the time the\r\n  Millers first acquired the condominium.\r\nAFFIRMED.Â   \r\nANDERSON and\r\n  THOMAS, JJ., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-142","title":"State v.

Anderson, Family Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2008-UP-145\r\nSubmitted November 1, 2007 â€“ Filed March\r\n  6, 2008Â Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tDavid Michael Collins, Jr., of Spartanburg, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tEdward A. Lamb, Richard H. Rhodes, both of Spartanburg, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: William\r\n  Robert Yown (Husband) appeals from the family court order granting Judy Anne\r\n  Yown (Wife) a divorce, arguing the family court erred in its determination of\r\n  marital property, valuation of special equity interests, and equitable division\r\n  of the marital estate.Â  We affirm.[1] \r\n \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were married on September 16, 1998.Â  At the time\r\n  of the marriage, both parties owned a pre-marital home and other personal\r\n  pre-marital property.Â  Approximately two years into the marriage, Husband and\r\n  Wife purchased a marital residence and subsequently sold their non-marital\r\n  homes.[2]Â \r\n  A substantial portion of Husbandâ€™s proceeds from the sale of his non-marital\r\n  home was paid toward the mortgage on the marital home and a lot adjoining the\r\n  marital residence, both of which were titled jointly.Â  The remaining money from\r\n  the sale of the non-marital homes was deposited into a joint checking account.[3]\r\nApproximately seven years into the marriage, Husband and Wife separated,\r\n  and Wife brought a separate maintenance action seeking equitable division of\r\n  the marital estate and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  At the hearing, Wife moved to amend her\r\n  complaint to request a divorce on the ground of one year continuous separation.Â  The family court granted Wifeâ€™s motion and issued an order granting a\r\n  divorce, dividing the marital estate equally between the parties, and awarding\r\n  each party special equity interests in certain items of the marital estate.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe family court\r\n  has broad discretion in determining how marital property is to be valued and\r\n  distributed; therefore, the court may use any reasonable means to divide the\r\n  property equitably, and its judgment will only be disturbed where an abuse of\r\n  discretion is found.Â  LaFrance v. LaFrance, 370 S.C. 622, 650-651, 636\r\n  S.E.2d 3, 18 (2006).Â  In reviewing the family courtâ€™s equitable apportionment\r\n  of marital property, an appellate courtâ€™s role is to examine the fairness of\r\n  the apportionment as a whole.Â  Id. (citing Bragg v. Bragg, 347 S.C. 16, 24, 553 S.E.2d 251, 255 (Ct. App. 2001)).Â  Generally, an appellate court will affirm the family\r\n  court if it can be determined the judge addressed the factors under the marital\r\n  property statute sufficiently for the appellate court to conclude the judge was\r\n  cognizant of the statutory factors.Â  Id. (citing Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345\r\n  S.C. 88, 100, 545 S.E.2d 531, 537 (Ct. App. 2001)); see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (1985). \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nProperty Adjoining Marital Residence and Special\r\n  Equity Interests\r\nHusband\r\n  alleges the family court erred by classifying the property adjoining the\r\n  marital residence as marital property.Â  Husband also maintains the family court\r\n  erred in its identification and valuation of the special equity interests of\r\n  both parties in the marital residence.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nHusband\r\n  asserts the adjoining lot was nonmarital property because it was purchased with\r\n  proceeds from the sale of his pre-marital home.Â  Husbandâ€™s home was pre-marital\r\n  property, and, ordinarily, property acquired in exchange for pre-marital\r\n  property is not considered marital property.Â  However:\r\n\r\n\t[i]n\r\n  certain circumstances, nonmarital property may be transmuted into marital\r\n  property if: (1) it becomes so commingled with marital property as to be\r\n  untraceable; (2) it is jointly titled; or (3) it is utilized by the parties in\r\n  support of the marriage or in some other manner so as to evidence an intent by\r\n  the parties to make it marital property.\r\n\r\nGreene v. Greene, 351 S.C. 329, 338, 569 S.E.2d 393, 398&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002)(internal\r\n  citations omitted). Â The property adjoining the marital estate was titled jointly.Â \r\n  The parties constructed a barn on the adjoining land and used it to store\r\n  personal property belonging to both Husband and Wife.Â  The barn was constructed\r\n  using an equity line of credit, which was paid with funds from the couplesâ€™\r\n  joint account.Â  For these reasons, we do not find the family court erred by\r\n  classifying the property adjoining the marital estate as marital property.Â  Furthermore, Husband was awarded a special equity interest for funds from the sale of his pre-marital home, which he contributed to the\r\n  adjoining lot.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nHusband\r\n  also claims the family court erred in its identification and valuation of the\r\n  special equity interests of both parties in the marital residence.Â  In the\r\n  present case, the family court considered and ruled upon the special equity\r\n  interests of both Husband and Wife.Â  Accordingly, if Husband believed\r\n  the family court overlooked or failed to specifically rule on some additional\r\n  special equity interest, he had the burden of presenting this issue to the\r\n  family court.Â  However, Husband did not file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion raising\r\n  the issue of a specific equity interest valuation to the family court, and thus,\r\n  we find this issue is not preserved for appeal. See Wilder\r\n    Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998); see also Halbersberg v. Berry, 302 S.C. 97, 103, 394 S.E.2d 7, 12 (1990)\r\n  (finding the omission of the master in equity not preserved because the party\r\n  did not bring the omission to the attention of the master through a proper\r\n  motion).\r\nThe Division of the Marital Estate\r\nHusband\r\n  further alleges the family court erred in calculating the division of the\r\n  marital estate.Â  Specifically, Husband argues the\r\n  family court erred by counting the value of the adjoining property twice in the\r\n  equitable division.Â  We find this issue is not preserved. Â \r\nAfter\r\n  the family court issued its order, Husband did not file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion\r\n  raising the issue of the double-inclusion of the adjoining lot to the family\r\n  court judge.Â  Thus, we find this issue is not preserved for appeal.Â  See Wilder, 330 S.C. at 76, 497 S.E.2d at 733; see\r\n    also Halbersberg, 302 S.C. at 103, 394 S.E.2d at 12.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we find the family court did not err in its determination of marital property,\r\n  valuation of special equity interests, or equitable division of the marital\r\n  estate.Â  Accordingly, the decision\r\n  of the family court is  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nANDERSON, SHORT, and WILLIAMS JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Prior to the marriage, Wife had a house, with a\r\n  mortgage, at 106 Blueberry Lane, Inman, and Husband had a house, with a\r\n  mortgage, at 116 Shenandoah Drive, Spartanburg.Â  After the marriage, Husband\r\n  and Wife resided in Husbandâ€™s Shenandoah home for approximately two years until\r\n  they moved to 221 Williams Drive, Campobello.\r\n[3] From the beginning of their marriage, Husband and\r\n  Wife shared a joint checking account, which was managed by Husband with the\r\n  Wifeâ€™s consent.Â  Both incomes, which were approximately equal, went into this\r\n  account, and all bills, including mortgages and expenses for their non-marital\r\n  properties were paid from this account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-146","title":"State v.

Elliott, of Columbia; for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tWilliam E. Bird, of Columbia; for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  Donald Martin appeals certain provisions of a family court order concerning his\r\n  visitation with his daughter.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nReilly Ann Martin\r\n  was born to Donald Martin and Audrey Halverson on July 5, 2000, while Halverson\r\n  was separated from her husband.Â  Although Halverson and her husband later reconciled,\r\n  Martin visited with Reilly regularly after her birth.\r\nIn April or May of 2002,\r\n  Halverson informed Martin she, her husband, and Reilly were moving to Newport News , Virginia.Â  Because of this development, Martin brought suit in July 2002 to\r\n  establish his paternity and ensure continued access to the child.\r\nAt a pendente lite hearing in the Lexington County Family Court on July 19, 2002, the\r\n  parties informed the court they had reached an agreement under which they would\r\n  have joint custody of Reilly with Halverson having primary custodial care and\r\n  Martin being allowed to visit with her in Virginia at his own expense and with\r\n  proper notice.Â  They also settled the issue of child support.Â  Because,\r\n  however, they were unable to agree on other visitation terms, the family court\r\n  set visitation on a temporary basis, granting Martin two one-week periods in\r\n  the Fall of 2002, and provided a guardian ad litem would be\r\n  appointed for Reilly if Martin and Halverson could not reach a mutually\r\n  acceptable agreement concerning visitation between Martin and Reilly.\r\nAfter the temporary hearing, the parties reached\r\n  an agreement under which Martin would see Reilly for a week at a time when his\r\n  work schedule allowed.Â  The arrangement continued until August 2004, when Reilly,\r\n  while visiting relatives in Michigan with Martin, fractured her arm at a fast\r\n  food restaurant playground.Â  After this occurrence, Halverson restricted\r\n  Martinâ€™s visitation with Reilly, prompting him to bring another lawsuit, this\r\n  time to establish visitation rights with Reilly in accordance with her age and\r\n  school activities and taking into account the distance between the parties.Â  \r\n \r\nAlthough\r\n  the parties eventually agreed on visitation terms for Thanksgiving, Christmas,\r\n  and spring vacation, they could not agree on terms for weekends and summer\r\n  vacation.Â  In addition, they disagreed on transportation arrangements.\r\nAfter\r\n  taking testimony, the family court issued an order on February 3, 2006, requiring\r\n  among other things that, for any three-day weekend visit in South Carolina, Halverson\r\n  would take Reilly to Columbia and Martin would return her to Newport News at\r\n  the end of the visit.Â  In addition, Martin was granted three weeks of\r\n  visitation in the summer with Reilly.\r\nMartin\r\n  moved to alter or amend the order, asking the family court to reconsider\r\n  transportation arrangements and requesting additional time to visit with Reilly\r\n  in the summer.Â  After a hearing on June 12, 2006, the family court, by order\r\n  dated August 10, 2006, declined to change the transportation arrangements, but\r\n  granted Martin an additional week of visitation in the summer.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  determination of visitation is within the broad discretion of the family court,\r\n  and, unless that discretion is abused, a visitation order will not be disturbed\r\n  on appeal.Â  Cudd v. Arline, 277 S.C. 236, 239, 285 S.E.2d 881, 883\r\n  (1981).Â  The family court may in its discretion impose on a noncustodial parent\r\n  such conditions and restrictions on visitation as it finds proper.Â  Frye v.\r\n    Frye, 323 S.C. 72, 76, 448 S.E.2d 586, 588 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  â€œThe privilege of visitation must yield to the good of the\r\n  child and may be denied or limited where the best interests of the child will\r\n  be served thereby.â€Â  Porter v. Porter, 246 S.C. 332, 340, 143\r\n  S.E.2d 619, 624 (1965).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Martin first contends the\r\n  family court should have required both parents to meet halfway for most of the\r\n  visits.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  support of his position, Martin cites Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 599\r\n  S.E.2d 114 (Ct. App. 2004), in which this Court ordered the father of three\r\n  children to pay transportation expenses for visits between him and the partiesâ€™\r\n  two younger children, characterizing his his move to California with their\r\n  oldest child as â€œunilateral.â€Â  Id. at 532, 599 S.E.2d at 123.Â  Martin also\r\n  argues the family court overlooked the facts that he is the only parent who is\r\n  employed and he therefore does not have a flexible schedule.Â   \r\nAlthough\r\n  these arguments support Martinâ€™s desire to meet Halverson halfway to exchange\r\n  Reilly for visits, they do not warrant reversal of the family court order.Â \r\n  First, Patel, the case on which Martin relies, involved the issue of\r\n  travel expenses incurred in the exercise of out-of-state visitation, not the\r\n  issue of inconvenience to the noncustodial parent.Â  Moreover, there is nothing\r\n  in the record to suggest that Halverson moved to Virginia to impair Martinâ€™s\r\n  relationship with Reilly.Â  In addition, under the terms set by the family\r\n  court, both Martin and Halverson have to travel one time from their respective\r\n  home states and back to transport Reilly for visitation during three-day\r\n  weekends.Â  Finally, the arrangement Martin desires reduces neither the burden\r\n  nor the distance for either party.Â  Under these circumstances, we find the\r\n  family court acted within its discretion in refusing to require the parties to\r\n  meet halfway when exchanging Reilly for visits with Martin.\r\n2.Â  Martin also contends the\r\n  family court granted him insufficient time with Reilly in the summer.Â  He\r\n  points out that Reilly is now in school and has thirteen weeks of summer\r\n  vacation.Â  Citing Arnal v. Arnal, 363 S.C. 268, 609 S.E.2d 821 (Ct. App. 2005), affâ€™d as modified on other grounds, 371 S.C. 10, 636 S.E. 864\r\n  (2006), he emphasizes that he would be better able to learn more about Reilly\r\n  and her needs if given more time with the child to do so.Â  We, however, find no\r\n  abuse of discretion in the family courtâ€™s decision to limit Martin to four\r\n  weeks of visitation in the summer with Reilly.Â  See Woodall v.\r\n    Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 12, 471 S.E.2d 154, 158 (1996) (stating the issue of\r\n  visitation is within the discretion of the family court).Â   \r\nBased\r\n  on the evidence in the record, we find the family court fashioned a summer\r\n  visitation schedule that was in Reillyâ€™s best interest.Â  See id. (â€œWhen awarding visitation, the controlling consideration is the welfare and\r\n  best interest of the child.â€).Â  As Halverson noted, during extended periods of\r\n  visitation with Reilly, Martin would have to work, which would require him to\r\n  put Reilly in some type of childcare environment.Â  Halverson further testified\r\n  that, the one time she attempted to enroll Reilly in daycare, Reilly became\r\n  confrontational.Â  Moreover, Halverson indicated she is amenable to increasing the\r\n  summer visitation when Reilly is older.Â  We therefore hold that, considering\r\n  Martinâ€™s work schedule, Reillyâ€™s age, and other pertinent factors, the summer\r\n  visitation granted by the family court is reasonable and in Reillyâ€™s best\r\n  interest.[2]\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, SHORT, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Halverson requested reinstatement of the family\r\n  courtâ€™s original order, under which Martin received only three weeks of\r\n  visitation in the summer; however, she did not file an appellantâ€™s brief on\r\n  this issue.Â  We therefore hold the request is not properly before this Court\r\n  and decline to address it.Â  See Rules 208(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B), SCACR\r\n  (setting forth deadlines requirements for the appellantâ€™s initial brief,\r\n  including a statement of each of the issues presented for review); id.

Laughlin, of Hilton Head Island; for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Portside\r\n  Owners Association, Inc. (Portside) filed this action against South Beach\r\n  Racquet Club, Inc. (South Beach), seeking a determination of the partiesâ€™\r\n  rights to a tract of real property.Â  South Beach prevailed at trial, and\r\n  Portside appeals.Â  We affirm. [1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn\r\n  1985, Charles Fraser created three corporations known as Beachside-Portside,\r\n  Inc. (Beachside), Portside, and South Beach.Â  On September 29, 1986, Fraser\r\n  conveyed six building lots, a common area, and a 50' access easement (the 50'\r\n  Tract) to Beachside.\r\nOn\r\n  September 30, 1986, Beachside recorded a Declaration of Covenants, Conditions\r\n  and Restrictions for the six lots, common area, and 50' Tract comprising\r\n  Portside Subdivision.Â  The covenants granted to the Portside homeowners the\r\n  right to transfer interests in the common area.Â  In the covenants, Beachside\r\n  reserved to itself a right to exercise the powers granted to Portside without\r\n  the Portside ownersâ€™ consent.Â  However, this right expired if Beachside no\r\n  longer owned at least two of the six lots.Â  By December 30, 1986, Beachside had\r\n  conveyed all six of the residential lots to third parties.  \r\nIn\r\n  1987 or 1988, South Beach prepared to build four tennis courts.Â  At the time, Fraser\r\n  possessed a controlling interest in South Beach.Â  On May 26, 1987, Fraser, as\r\n  president and on behalf of Beachside, wrote a letter to South Beach acknowledging and consenting to encroachment of the tennis courts into the 50' Tract (the\r\n  Encroachment Letter).Â  The courts were built by 1988 and encroached into the 50'\r\n  Tract.  \r\nOn\r\n  May 14, 1992, Beachside conveyed â€œa perpetual, non-exclusive Easement and\r\n  right-of-way for ingress and egress on, over and across the [50' Tract]â€ to South Beach in an â€œAccess Easementâ€ (the Easement).Â  The Easement was recorded on October\r\n  30, 1992.Â  In addition to the rights of ingress and egress, the Easement stated\r\n  South Beach â€œshall have the right to maintain such portions thereof as Grantee\r\n  is presently maintaining for use as parking and landscaped areas, including the\r\n  right, at the sole cost and expense of Grantee, to install such paving,\r\n  curbing, drainage and irrigation facilities, and other similar or related improvements\r\n  as Grantee shall require.â€  \r\nBeachside\r\n  conveyed the 50' Tract to Portside in a quit-claim deed, dated May 1, 1992, and\r\n  recorded on November 6, 1992.Â  The deed states on its face that it is subject\r\n  to â€œan easement for ingress and egress and parking reserved to South Beach\r\n  Racquet Club, Inc. in that certain document entitled Access Easement, dated May\r\n  14, 1992, by and between Grantor and South Beach Racquet Club, Inc.â€  \r\nApproximately\r\n  twelve years later, Portside filed this action on February 20, 2004, alleging the\r\n  Easement and Encroachment Letter are invalid, thus South Beachâ€™s use of the\r\n  Tract constitutes trespass.Â  Portside also sought declaratory relief.Â  The\r\n  trial court found if Portsideâ€™s action against South Beachâ€™s use of the Tract\r\n  is based on a breach of covenants, it is barred by the three year statute of\r\n  limitations.Â  The trial court further found if the action is characterized as\r\n  one for the recovery of real property, it is barred by the ten year statute of\r\n  limitations for the recovery of real property.Â  The trial court also found,\r\n  with respect to the tennis court encroachments, South Beach proved its claim\r\n  for adverse possession.Â  Portside appeals.Â  Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œA\r\n  suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined\r\n  by the nature of the underlying issue.Â  An issue, essentially one at law, will\r\n  not be transformed into one in equity simply because declaratory relief is\r\n  sought.â€ Â Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991).Â  The character of an action as\r\n  legal or equitable is determined by the main purpose of the complaint, the\r\n  nature of the issues as raised by the pleadings or the pleadings and proof, and\r\n  the character of the relief sought under them.Â  Ins. Fin. Servs., Inc. v. S.C.\r\n    Ins. Co., 271 S.C. 289, 293, 247 S.E.2d 315, 318 (1978).  \r\nThe\r\n  issue of title is legal in nature. Getsinger v. Midlands Orthopaedic Profit\r\n    Sharing Plan, 327 S.C. 424, 428, 489 S.E.2d 223, 224 (Ct. App. 1997). â€œAn\r\n  action brought for the primary purpose of determining title to a disputed land\r\n  is in the nature of a trespass action to try title, which is an action at law.â€Â  Watson v. Suggs,&nbsp;313 S.C. 291, 293, 437 S.E.2d 172, 173&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 1993).Â  An adverse possession claim is an action at law.Â  Clark v. Hargrave, 323 S.C. 84, 87, 473 S.E.2d 474, 476&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996).\r\nIn\r\n  an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, we may not disturb\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s findings of fact unless they are unsupported by the\r\n  evidence or controlled by error of law.Â  Auto Owners Ins. Co. v. Langford, 330 S.C. 578, 581, 500 S.E.2d 496, 498 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.\r\n  Â The Statutes of Limitations\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Portside initially argues\r\n  its claims are not barred by the applicable statutes of limitations because it\r\n  consented to South Beachâ€™s use of the 50' Tract until October 24, 2003, so that the applicable limitation periods for the\r\n  actions for breach of the covenants and the recovery of real property did not\r\n  commence until that date.Â  Thus, Portside argues, the action was initiated\r\n  within the applicable statutory period of three years for breach of covenants and\r\n  ten years for the action to recover real property. Â See S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§Â§ 15-3-340 &amp; 15-3-530 (2005).Â   \r\nA.&nbsp;Recovery of Real Property\r\nWe\r\n  find Portsideâ€™s action is essentially an action for the recovery of real\r\n  property and is barred by the ten year statute of limitations.Â  In determining\r\n  whether a proceeding is an action for the recovery of real property within the\r\n  meaning of the statute of limitations, the pleadings as a whole must be\r\n  considered.Â  Winn v. Grantham,&nbsp;263 S.C. 368, 371, 210 S.E.2d 602,\r\n  603&nbsp;(1974). Â â€œThe character of an\r\n  action is not to be determined by the terminology which the pleaders may chance\r\n  to give to it.â€ Â Walsh v. Evans, 112 S.C. 131,\r\n  136, 99 S.E. 546, 548 (1919). Â â€œ[W]hen\r\n  a defendantâ€™s right to property is attacked and in his answer he raises the\r\n  â€˜flag of dominionâ€™ the issue of recovery has been established.â€Â  Winn,\r\n  263 S.C. at 372, 210 S.E.2d at 604.Â  Â Â \r\nThe gravamen\r\n  of Portsideâ€™s complaint is to remove any cloud on its title in the 50' Tract and affirm its exclusive right to\r\n  possession of the property. Â Portside attacked South Beachâ€™s use of the\r\n  property as a violation of Portsideâ€™s exclusive rights.Â  As an action for the\r\n  recovery of real property, the action is governed by section 15-3-340, which states\r\n  that an action for the recovery of real property may not be maintained â€œunless\r\n  it appears that the plaintiff, his ancestor, predecessor, or grantor, was\r\n  seized or possessed of the premises in question within ten years before the\r\n  commencement of the action.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-340 (2005).Â  Portside\r\n  commenced this action to recover its exclusive rights in the property by filing\r\n  its summons and complaint on February 20, 2004.Â  Therefore, under section\r\n  15-3-340, Portsideâ€™s action may only be maintained if it was possessed of those\r\n  exclusive rights to the 50' Tract within ten years\r\n  of February 20, 2004, i.e., at any time after February 20, 1994.Â   \r\nSouth Beach encroached on the property by building tennis courts in 1988 and received the\r\n  Easement for ingress and egress in 1992, both more than ten years prior to the\r\n  filing of this action.Â  To avoid the application of the statute, Portside\r\n  argues it consented to South Beachâ€™s encroachment and use until 2003.Â Â   \r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consent\r\nPortside argues it\r\n  consented to South Beachâ€™s use of the property until October 24, 2003, the date\r\n  it alleges it revoked its consent and thus, the statute of limitations did not\r\n  begin to run until that date.Â  We disagree.Â Â Â   \r\nWe\r\n  find evidence in the record to support the finding that Portside did not\r\n  consent to South Beachâ€™s use of the 50' Tract.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s order does not specifically state that Portside did\r\n  not consent.Â  However, the court stated that Portside â€œsuffered South Beach to use and maintain the encroachments, and to occupy the [50' Tract] in a manner consistent with the written\r\n  easement for a period of more than ten years prior to bringing this action.â€ Â The\r\n  South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure require that â€œ[i]n all actions tried\r\n  upon the facts without a jury or with an advisory jury, the court shall find\r\n  the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon.â€ Rule\r\n  52(a), SCRCP. The rule is directorial in nature so â€œwhere a trial court \r\nsubstantially complies with Rule 52(a) and\r\n    adequately states the basis for the result it reaches, the\r\n  appellate court should not vacate the trial courtâ€™s judgment for lack of an\r\n  explicit or specific factual finding.â€ Â Noisette v. Ismail, 304\r\n  S.C. 56, 57, 403 S.E.2d 122, 123-24 (1991).Â   \r\nWe\r\n  find substantial compliance by the circuit court in making its findings, and\r\n  evidence to support the finding that Portside did not consent to the\r\n  encroachments.Â  See Kirkland v. Gross, 286 S.C. 193, 198,\r\n  332 S.E.2d 546, 549 (Ct. App. 1985), receded from on other grounds by Boyd\r\n    v. Hyatt, 294 S.C. 360, 364 S.E.2d 478 (Ct. App. 1988) (finding the\r\n  question of acquiescence in an action for adverse possession is generally a\r\n  question of fact).Â  See also Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of\r\n    Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976) (stating\r\n  appellate court will not disturb factual findings in an action at law tried\r\n  without a jury unless there is no evidence reasonably supporting the findings).\r\nThe\r\n  only evidence Portside offers as support for its argument that it consented is\r\n  the October 24, 2003 letter purporting to revoke its consent.Â  However, there\r\n  is contradictory evidence. Â The 1992 deed from Beachside to Portside referenced\r\n  the Easement granted to South Beach.Â  Furthermore, the minutes of Portsideâ€™s\r\n  annual meetings on November 2, 1991, November 7, 1992, October 16, 1993, and\r\n  October 8, 1994, indicate Portside was aware of potential title problems to the 50' Tract.Â  The minutes reflect that Portside\r\n  specifically questioned what other rights any other entity had in the 50' Tract, raised questions regarding South Beachâ€™s responsibilities concerning the property, and sought legal counsel to address\r\n  these issues.Â  Portside abandoned these inquiries in 1994.Â  The minutes of the\r\n  October 16, 1999 meeting indicate Portside again questioned its title to the\r\n  property.Â  The minutes of the October 19, 2002 meeting reflect a discussion of\r\n  the encroachments and Easement.Â  Portsideâ€™s president admitted the minutes from\r\n  Portsideâ€™s annual meetings reveal no evidence that Portside ever permitted South\r\n  Beach to use or encroach on the property.Â  We find evidence to support the\r\n  conclusion that Portside did not consent to South Beachâ€™s use.Â  Therefore, we affirm\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s finding that the statute of limitations for the recovery of\r\n  real property commenced at the time the Easement began to run in 1987 for the\r\n  encroachments with the Encroachment Letter and in 1992 with the Easement for South Beachâ€™s use of the 50' Tract.Â  \r\n \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Adverse Possession\r\nPortside\r\n  next argues South Beach did not establish the elements of its affirmative\r\n  defense of adverse possession regarding the tennis court encroachments because South Beach never had exclusive possession of Portsideâ€™s property.Â  Additionally, Portside\r\n  argues South Beach did not establish that its adverse possession was for the\r\n  required number of years.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn South Carolina, a party may establish adverse possession after possessing adversely to the\r\n  owner for ten years.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-67-210 (2005).Â  To constitute adverse\r\n  possession, the possession must be actual, open, notorious, hostile,\r\n  continuous, and exclusive for the entire statutory period. Mullis v. Winchester, 237 S.C.\r\n  487, 491, 118 S.E.2d 61, 63 (1961).Â  The question of\r\n  adverse possession is one of fact and only becomes one of law when the evidence\r\n  is undisputed and susceptible of but one inference.Â  Lynch\r\n    v. Lynch, 236 S.C. 612, 622, 115 S.E.2d 301, 306 (1960).Â  Therefore,\r\n  our review is limited to determining whether the circuit courtâ€™s findings are\r\n  without evidentiary support or controlled by an error of law.Â  Auto\r\n    Owners Ins. Co. v. Langford, 330 S.C. 578, 581, 500 S.E.2d 496, 498 (Ct. App. 1998). \r\n \r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;Exclusive Possession\r\nPortside\r\n  argues South Beach did not establish exclusive possession of Portsideâ€™s\r\n  property because â€œPortside, as the owner of the entire [50' Tract], and South Beach, as an occupier of the [50' Tract], are both in possession of and share the\r\n  [50' Tract] in its entirety.â€Â  Additionally, Portside\r\n  argues â€œthe physical encroachments on the [50' Tract] by South Beach do not prevent the Portside homeowners from their use of\r\n  the [50' Tract] as a whole.â€ Â Â \r\nâ€œThe\r\n  general rule is that where an owner of property and an occupier are both in\r\n  possession, the possession of the legal owner prevails to the exclusion of the\r\n  other.â€ Â Butler v. Lindsey, 293 S.C. 466, 472, 361 S.E.2d 621,\r\n  624&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1987).Â  The element of\r\n  exclusivity required to acquire title by adverse possession is not met if\r\n  occupancy is shared with the owner. Â Id.  \r\nHowever,\r\n  the trial court did not find South Beach established adverse possession with\r\n  respect to the entire 50' Tract but merely as to the encroachments.Â  In\r\n  support of this finding, the circuit court noted â€œ[s]ince the encroachments\r\n  actually occupy a portion of the [50' Tract], South Beachâ€™s possession has been actual and exclusive.â€Â  As to the\r\n  tennis court encroachments, we agree South Beachâ€™s use was not shared with\r\n  Portside and therefore, met the element of exclusivity.Â  The encroachments\r\n  occupy the portions of Portsideâ€™s property on which they are built, so that the\r\n  property may not be used for any other purpose.Â  In addition, there is\r\n  testimony in the record stating the tennis courts were fenced in, there was no\r\n  way to access the tennis courts from the 50' Tract, and they have been in the exclusive possession of South Beach since 1988.Â  Accordingly, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s finding of exclusivity.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nB.&nbsp;The Statutory Period for\r\n  Adverse Possession\r\nPortside\r\n  also argues South Beach did not prove it adversely possessed the property for\r\n  the required number of years.Â  Portside argues that because South Beach maintains the Encroachment Letter gave it the right to encroach, the encroachment\r\n  was not hostile until after Portside revoked consent in 2003.Â  However, the\r\n  Encroachment Letter was signed by Fraser on behalf of Beachside, not Portside,\r\n  and any consent to encroach granted by Beachside is not attributable to\r\n  Portside as Beachside and Portside are separate corporate entities.Â  Thus, even\r\n  if the encroachment is hostile to Beachside, it could be hostile to Portside.Â  See Hunting v. Elders, 359 S.C. 217, 223, 597 S.E.2d 803, 806 (Ct. App. 2004) (finding corporations are separate entities).Â  We find evidence in the\r\n  record to support a finding of hostility as to Portside.  \r\nThe\r\n  only evidence in the record is that South Beachâ€™s possession began in 1988 with\r\n  the construction of the tennis courts.Â  The statutory period for adverse\r\n  possession is ten years.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-67-210 (2005).Â  Portside attempt\r\n  to revoke its consent in 2003 and filed this action in 2004.Â  We agree with the\r\n  trial court that South Beach established its adverse possession for the\r\n  statutory period.Â   \r\nIII.&nbsp;Trespass\r\nPortside\r\n  finally contends the trial court erred in failing to find South Beachâ€™s use of the easement constitutes a continuing trespass because South Beach did not receive a valid grant of an easement.Â  We disagree.\r\nTrespass\r\n  is an intentional invasion of the plaintiffâ€™s interest in the exclusive use of\r\n  his property.Â  Hedgepath v.

Swinney appeals his commitment\r\n  to the South Carolina Department of Mental Health (the Department) as a\r\n  sexually violent predator. Â We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL /\r\n  PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn November 29, 1999, Swinney pled guilty\r\n  to criminal sexual conduct.Â  He was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of\r\n  five years.Â   \r\nPrior\r\n  to Swinneyâ€™s scheduled release from prison, his case was referred to the\r\n  sexually violent predator multi-disciplinary team.[2] Â The multi-disciplinary team\r\n  reviewed Swinneyâ€™s case, determined he satisfied the definition of a sexually\r\n  violent predator as provided in the Sexually Violent Predator Act (the Act),[3] and forwarded the case to the\r\n  prosecutorâ€™s review committee.[4] Â The prosecutorâ€™s review committee reviewed the case and agreed there\r\n  was probable cause to believe Swinney satisfied the criteria for commitment\r\n  under the Act.[5]Â \r\n  The State subsequently filed a petition in circuit court to commit Swinney to\r\n  the Department for care and treatment as a sexually violent predator.[6] Â After a hearing,[7] the trial court held probable cause\r\n  existed to find Swinney met the criteria for commitment and ordered a mental\r\n  health evaluation by Dr. Pamela Crawford. Â Dr. Crawford evaluated\r\n  Swinney and concluded he did not meet the criteria for commitment under the\r\n  Act.Â  The trial court, therefore, dismissed the Stateâ€™s petition without\r\n  prejudice.Â   \r\nSwinney\r\n  was released to community supervision on December January 29, 2004.Â  Subsequent\r\n  to his release, Swinneyâ€™s community supervision was revoked because he failed\r\n  to attend sex offender counseling and failed to comply with a home detention\r\n  order. Â In addition, in May 2005, Swinney was charged with criminal\r\n  sexual conduct, assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature, and\r\n  kidnapping.Â   \r\nOn September\r\n  6, 2005, relying in part on events occurring after Swinneyâ€™s release from\r\n  prison, the State filed its second petition to have Swinney confined to the\r\n  Department. Â The trial court found probable cause existed to find\r\n  Swinney was a sexually violent predator.Â  Again, the trial court ordered that the\r\n  Department conduct a mental health evaluation of Swinney.Â  Dr. Donna Schwartz-Watts\r\n  evaluated Swinney and concluded he met the criteria for civil commitment.Â \r\n \r\nThe\r\n  matter came to trial on August 2, 2006.Â  Prior to the start of the trial, Swinney moved to dismiss the case on the ground it was barred by the doctrine\r\n  of res judicata.Â  Swinney relied on the first probable cause hearing and\r\n  evaluation and the fact that he had no new convictions. Â The trial court\r\n  denied Swinneyâ€™s motion, finding the prior predator case was dismissed without\r\n  prejudice and the events subsequent to Swinneyâ€™s release constituted a\r\n  substantial change in circumstances that warranted the new action.Â  Following\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s ruling, the case proceeded to a jury trial.Â   \r\nDr. Schwartz-Watts testified for the State. Â She opined\r\n  Swinney suffers from â€œsexual disorder not other specifiedâ€ that makes him\r\n  likely to sexually assault women with whom he has a sexual relationship.Â  Â Dr.\r\n  Schwartz-Watts stated it was her medical opinion that Swinney is predisposed to\r\n  commit future acts of sexual violence. Â She stated Swinneyâ€™s history of\r\n  substance abuse, history of sexual violence, resistance to seek treatment, refusal\r\n  to admit his offending behavior, and violation of his community supervision\r\n  influenced her opinion. She ultimately concluded Swinney met the requirements\r\n  to be considered a sexually violent predator.  \r\nThe jury found beyond a reasonable doubt Swinney\r\n  was a sexually violent predator.Â  The trial court committed Swinney to the\r\n  Department for long-term treatment.Â  Swinney appeals.\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Res\r\n  Judicata\r\nSwinney argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to\r\n  dismiss because the Stateâ€™s second petition was barred by res judicata.  \r\nUnder\r\n  the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment on the merits in a prior action\r\n  will bar the parties from initiating a second action based on the same issues.[8]Â  Res\r\n  judicata requires: (1) the judgment to be final, valid, and on the merits; (2)\r\n  the parties in the subsequent action to be identical to those in the first; and\r\n  (3) the second action to involve matter properly included in the first action.[9] Â \r\nSwinney contends\r\n  the initial probable cause hearing and dismissal without prejudice constituted\r\n  a final judgment on the merits.Â  Â We disagree.\r\nThe Act provides\r\n  that the purpose of a probable cause hearing is to determine â€œwhether probable\r\n  cause exists to believe the person is a sexually violent predator.â€[10]Â \r\n  The Act further provides if the court determines probable cause exists, â€œthe\r\n  court shall conduct a trial to determine whether the person is a sexually\r\n  violent predator.â€[11] Â A probable cause hearing, therefore, does not constitute a final judgment on\r\n  the merits.Â  Instead, a probable cause hearing is simply a preliminary hearing\r\n  for the purpose of determining whether probable cause exists to set the matter\r\n  for trial on the merits.\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  a dismissal without prejudice does not constitute a final adjudication on the\r\n  merits. [12]Â   \r\nHere,\r\n  the trial court dismissed the Stateâ€™s initial petition without prejudice after\r\n  a probable cause hearing and a mental health evaluation.Â  The initial action,\r\n  therefore, did not constitute a final judgment on the merits.Â  Accordingly, res\r\n  judicata did not bar the Stateâ€™s second petition or subsequent trial.\r\nII.&nbsp; Sexually Violent\r\n  Predator Act\r\nSwinney also argues the trial court erred in allowing the State to\r\n  proceed with its case because the State did not meet the required elements as\r\n  outlined in the Act.Â   \r\nA sexually violent predator is defined in the Act as â€œa person who\r\n  (a) has been convicted of a sexually violent offense; and (b) suffers from a\r\n  mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to\r\n  engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility for\r\n  long-term control, care, and treatment.â€[13]Â \r\n  â€œMental abnormalityâ€ is defined as â€œa mental condition affecting a personâ€™s\r\n  emotional or volitional capacity that predisposes the person to commit sexually\r\n  violent offenses.â€[14]Â \r\n  The phrase â€œlikely to engage in acts of sexual violenceâ€ is defined as a\r\n  â€œpropensity to commit acts of sexual violence . . . of such a degree as to pose\r\n  a menace to the health and safety of others.â€[15]Â   \r\nHere, Swinney\r\n  pled guilty to criminal sexual conduct, a sexually violent offense under the\r\n  Act.[16]Â  Also, the record shows evidence\r\n  Swinney suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder, making him\r\n  likely to engage in additional acts of sexual violence. Â As set forth above,\r\n  Dr. Schwartz-Watts testified Swinney suffers from â€œsexual disorder not other specified,â€ which predisposes him to commit future\r\n  acts of sexual violence. Â Dr. Schwartz-Watts further opined Swinney met the\r\n  criteria for commitment under the SVP Act. Accordingly, Swinneyâ€™s civil\r\n  commitment is\r\nAFFIRMED.  \r\nHEARN, C.J., PIEPER, JJ., and GOOLSBY,\r\n  A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]&nbsp; See S.C.

Â In her Complaint, Wife alleged the partiesâ€™ equitably divided all\r\n  marital property at the time of separation, with the exception of a Harley\r\n  Davidson motorcycle.Â  Wife sought a divorce, approval of the division of the\r\n  property, alimony, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  family court held a final hearing on March 14, 2006.Â  Wife testified Husband\r\n  took several items of personal property from the marital home after the\r\n  partiesâ€™ separation. Â Wife offered evidence as to the value of the property.Â \r\n  Wife also submitted an Affidavit of Attorneyâ€™s Fees.Â  Husband did not appear at\r\n  the hearing or offer any testimony.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  family court issued a decree of divorce on April 13, 2006. Â In the decree, the\r\n  family court ordered Husband to return the personal property he removed from\r\n  the marital home and valued the personal property at $35,745.Â  The decree further\r\n  provided if Husband did not return the personal property within ten days he\r\n  must pay $300 per month to Wife until he returned the property or paid for the\r\n  property in full. Â In addition, the family court ordered Husband to pay\r\n  Wife $3,500 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â   \r\nHusband\r\n  filed a motion to reconsider the family courtâ€™s order pursuant to Rule 59(e),\r\n  SCRCP, asking the family court to decrease the value of the personal property\r\n  and extend the time limit for him to return the personal property. Â In\r\n  addition, Husband argued the family courtâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees was\r\n  excessive in nature.Â  Â The family court denied the motion, and this\r\n  appeal followed.  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn\r\n  appellate court, in its review of an appeal from family court, has jurisdiction\r\n  to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003).Â  â€œThis,\r\n  however, does not require this Court to disregard the findings of the family\r\n  court.Â  Neither is this Court required to ignore the fact that the family court\r\n  judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate\r\n  their testimony.â€Â  Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 328, 526 S.E.2d 241, 245 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nLAW\r\n  / ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Return of Personal\r\n  Property\r\nHusband argues the\r\n  family court lacked authority to order him to return the personal property\r\n  because the property was non-marital.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe family court has\r\n  the power to apportion marital property.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472\r\n  (Supp. 2007). Â Here, the family court did not find the personal property was\r\n  non-marital, but treated the property as though it was marital.Â  Furthermore, the\r\n  husband failed to raise this issue at trial or in his Rule 59(e), SCRCP,\r\n  motion. Â This issue, therefore, is not preserved for review. Â See Washington v. Washington, 308 S.C. 549,\r\n  551, 419 S.E.2d 779, 781 (1992) (holding when an appellant neither raises an\r\n  issue at trial nor through a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion, the issue is not preserved for appellate review).\r\nII.&nbsp; Valuation\r\n  of Personal Property\r\nHusband argues the\r\n  family courtâ€™s valuation of the personal property was in error.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe family court is\r\n  charged with the duty of identifying real and personal\r\n  marital property and determining the propertyâ€™s fair market value.Â  Abercrombie\r\n    v. Abercrombie,&nbsp; 372 S.C. 643, 647, 643 S.E.2d 697, 699&nbsp;(Ct. App.\r\n  2007). Â â€œIn the absence of contrary evidence, the court should accept\r\n  the value the parties assign to a marital asset.â€ Â Id. Moreover, a\r\n  property owner is competent to offer testimony as to the value of his property.\r\n  Â Cooper v. Cooper, 289 S.C. 377, 379, 346 S.E.2d 326, 327 (Ct. App.\r\n  1986). Â â€œA family court may accept the valuation of one party over another, and\r\n  the courtâ€™s valuation of marital property will be affirmed if it is within the\r\n  range of evidence presented.â€ Â Abercrombie,&nbsp; 372 S.C. at 647, 643\r\n  S.E.2d at 699.&nbsp;\r\nHere, Wife\r\n  specifically testified and submitted an exhibit as to the value of the personal\r\n  property.Â  The family courtâ€™s valuation approximates the value of the property\r\n  Wife presented.Â  Accordingly, the family court did not err in valuing the\r\n  personal property.Â   \r\nII.&nbsp; Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nHusband argues the\r\n  family court erred in awarding Wife $3,500 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Husband argues the family court failed to set forth the factors the court\r\n  considered in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees.Â   \r\nRule\r\n  26(a) of the South Carolina Rules of Family Court requires the family court to\r\n  â€œset forth the specific findings of fact and conclusions of law to support the\r\n  courtâ€™s decision.â€ Â Specifically, the family court should consider: (1) the\r\n  nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered; (2) the time\r\n  necessarily devoted to the case; (3) counselâ€™s professional standing; (4) the\r\n  contingency of compensation; (5) the beneficial results obtained; and (6) the\r\n  customary legal fees for similar services. Â Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304\r\n  S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).Â Â  When the family court fails to set\r\n  forth findings relating to the award of attorneyâ€™s fees, however, the appellate\r\n  court may remand the matter or, where the record is sufficient, make its own\r\n  findings of fact in accordance with the preponderance of the evidence. Griffith v. Griffith, 332 S.C. 630, 646-47, 506 S.E.2d 526, 535 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  The family courtâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees will not be\r\n  overturned absent an abuse of discretion. Â Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, 415, 368 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1988).Â Â  \r\n \r\nHere,\r\n  the record is sufficient for this Court to make the required findings of fact concerning\r\n  the award of attorneyâ€™s fees. Specifically, the record contains Wifeâ€™s attorney\r\n  fee affidavit.Â  See Bowers v. Bowers,&nbsp;349 S.C. 85, 98-99,\r\n  561 S.E.2d 610, 617-18&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002) (holding the record was sufficient\r\n  for the appellate court to make sufficient findings of fact where the record\r\n  contained the wifeâ€™s attorney fee affidavit).Â  Accordingly, we find no abuse of\r\n  discretion in the award.Â   \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., PIEPER, JJ., and GOOLSBY,\r\n  A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-158","title":"State v.

D. Rhoad, of Bamberg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In\r\n  this domestic action, Mae Ola Brown (Wife) appeals the family courtâ€™s\r\n  order requiring Robert Brown (Husband) to pay alimony retroactive to April 1,\r\n  2006.Â  Wife argues Husband owes her alimony dating back to a temporary divorce hearing on January 15, 2004.Â  Additionally, Wife argues the family court failed to set forth specific findings of\r\n  fact and conclusions of law in deciding not to award retroactive alimony as\r\n  required under Rule 26(a) of the South Carolina Rules of Family Court.Â  We affirm.[1]Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were married on November 7, 1970.Â  After thirty\r\n  two years of marriage, the couple separated in September of 2003.Â  Husband and\r\n  Wife had two children born out of the marriage who are now emancipated.Â  During\r\n  the marriage, Husband worked as a plumber and as of the date of the divorce\r\n  hearing, Husband had been working for himself for ten years.Â  Since 1979, Wife\r\n  has worked for Farmers and Merchants Bank in Holly Hill.Â  Wife and Husband testified\r\n  Husband paid their bills during the marriage, including the house payment until\r\n  he left their marital home.Â  Since Husband left the marriage, Wife testified\r\n  she has supported herself and borrowed money from family members.Â   \r\nOn September 3, 2003, Husband filed for divorce on the basis of\r\n  adultery and sought an equitable division of marital property.Â  Wife answered\r\n  and counterclaimed seeking permanent and temporary alimony.Â  Further, she\r\n  denied Husbandâ€™s adultery allegations.Â  Wife alleged adulterous conduct by\r\n  Husband and also sought an equitable division of the marital estate and alimony.Â \r\n  In a temporary order dated January 26, 2004, the family court did not rule on\r\n  whether to award temporary alimony but held this ruling in abeyance pending a\r\n  final hearing. Â \r\nIn its final decree of divorce on April 17, 2006, the family court\r\n  found Wife proved by clear and convincing evidence that Husband committed\r\n  adultery and granted her a divorce on this ground.Â  The family court found Husband\r\n  failed to prove his allegations of Wifeâ€™s adultery and denied granting him a\r\n  divorce on the basis of Wifeâ€™s adultery or on the ground of one year continuous\r\n  separation.Â  Additionally, the family court ordered Husband to pay $600 per\r\n  month in alimony to Wife, retroactive to April 1, 2006.Â  The family court also\r\n  granted Wife exclusive possession of the marital home and ordered Husband to\r\n  pay $7,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  This appeal follows.  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn\r\n  appeal from a family court order, this court has authority to correct errors of\r\n  law and find facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 473, 415 S.E.2d 812, 814\r\n  (1992).Â  However, â€œ[q]uestions concerning alimony rest with the sound\r\n  discretion of the [family] court, whose conclusions will not be disturbed\r\n  absent a showing of abuse of discretion.â€Â  Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C.\r\n  481, 485, 477 S.E.2d 727, 729 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The family\r\n  court abuses its discretion when factual findings are without evidentiary\r\n  support or a ruling is based upon an error of law. Â Smith v. Doe, 366\r\n  S.C. 469, 474, 623 S.E.2d 370, 372 (2005).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. Denial of retroactive\r\n  alimony \r\nWife argues the\r\n  family court abused its discretion in denying her retroactive alimony to the\r\n  date of the temporary hearing on January 15, 2004.Â  We disagree.  \r\nâ€œThe\r\n  decision to order retroactive support rests within the sound discretion of the\r\n  family court and should not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion of the\r\n  family court.â€ Â Thornton v. Thornton, 328 S.C. 96, 115, 492\r\n  S.E.2d 86, 96 (1997).Â  â€œAlimony is a substitute for the support which is\r\n  normally incident to the marital relationship.â€ Â Johnson v. Johnson, 296\r\n  S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1988) Â Factors to be\r\n  considered in making an alimony award include: (1) duration of the marriage;\r\n  (2) physical and emotional health of the\r\n  parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4) employment history and\r\n  earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living established during the\r\n  marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the parties; (7)\r\n  current and reasonably anticipated expenses and needs of the parties; (8)\r\n  marital and nonmarital properties of the parties; (9) custody of children; (10)\r\n  marital misconduct or fault; (11) tax consequences; and (12) prior support\r\n  obligations; as well as other factors the court considers relevant. S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2007).Â  Furthermore, when determining an alimony\r\n  award, courts may consider the amount received in equitable distribution.Â  Josey\r\n    v. Josey, 291 S.C. 26, 33, 351 S.E.2d 891, 895-96&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1986).Â  \r\n \r\nOn\r\n  January 15, 2004, Wife requested alimony during the temporary hearing.Â  The\r\n  family court denied her request based on Husbandâ€™s allegations of adultery, and\r\n  deferred ruling on whether to award retroactive alimony until the final\r\n  hearing.Â  Wife contends two years and three months lapsed between the initial\r\n  hearing and the final hearing, and during that time she borrowed money from her\r\n  family to help support herself.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  its temporary order, the family court awarded Wife temporary use and possession\r\n  of the marital home and its contents.Â  Thereafter, in its final decree, the\r\n  family court found â€œthe parties enjoyed a reasonable standard of livingâ€ during\r\n  their marriage.Â  In addition to equitably dividing the marital estate, the\r\n  family court noted none of the marital property had any debt associated with it\r\n  and granted Wife ownership of the marital home.Â  Furthermore, the family court\r\n  found Wife had inherited an interest in three acres of land with her brothers\r\n  from her motherâ€™s estate which was nonmarital property valued at $19,000.Â  The\r\n  family court also awarded Wife $7,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.\r\nIn\r\n  its final ruling, the family court found Wife had a monthly income of $1,375.Â \r\n  Wife testified she and Husband filed separate tax returns for the past thirteen\r\n  years, and in recent years Wife filed as a single, unmarried person.Â  In\r\n  addition, Wife admitted she and Husband had lived â€œseparate livesâ€ for nearly\r\n  ten years prior to their divorce.Â  Though Wife alleged she borrowed money from\r\n  her family to make ends meet after Husband moved out, nothing in the record\r\n  indicates the total amount loaned or the amount Wife needed to repay.Â  Moreover,\r\n  in regards to Wifeâ€™s monthly expenses at the time the couple separated, Wife\r\n  testified the coupleâ€™s marital home was paid off, but she still incurred\r\n  monthly expenses from electric and insurance bills, laundry and dry cleaning,\r\n  and life and health insurance.[2]Â \r\n  Specifically, Wife testified her monthly bills included $70 in home insurance\r\n  and between $300 and $350 in utility bills.Â  However, we note Wifeâ€™s financial\r\n  declarations, though discussed in testimony, were not included as part of the\r\n  record on appeal.Â  Wife, as appellant, has the burden of presenting a\r\n  sufficient record to allow review. See, e.g., Helms Realty, Inc. v.\r\n    Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 339, 611 S.E.2d 485, 447-48 (2005); Harkins\r\n      v. Greenville County, 340 S.C. 606, 616, 533 S.E.2d 886, 891 (2000).Â  \r\n \r\nWe\r\n  find the family court properly considered the factors set forth in section\r\n  20-3-130(C) in deciding to award alimony and determining when payments would\r\n  begin.Â  Therefore, based on the family courtâ€™s consideration of the coupleâ€™s standard\r\n  of living established during the marriage; each partiesâ€™ current and reasonably\r\n  anticipated earnings; marital and nonmarital properties of the parties; and the\r\n  amount each party received in the equitable distribution of marital property,\r\n  we find the family court did not abuse its discretion in denying Wife\r\n  retroactive alimony.Â  Additionally, we note the family court based its alimony\r\n  award â€œupon the length of the marriage, the relative income of the parties and\r\n  those other factors necessary to be considered in awarding alimony . . . .â€Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we affirm the family courtâ€™s order\r\n  requiring Husband pay $600 per month in alimony to Wife, retroactive only to\r\n  April 1, 2006.Â   \r\nII.Â  Rule 26(a) of the South Carolina Rules of Family Court\r\nWife argues the family\r\n  court failed to set forth specific findings of facts and conclusions of law in\r\n  deciding not to award retroactive alimony as required under Rule 26(a), SCRFC.Â \r\n  Instead, Wife argues the family court summarily stated it declined to award\r\n  retroactive alimony.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nRule 26(a), SCRFC,\r\n  provides: â€œAn order or judgment pursuant to an adjudication in a domestic\r\n  relations case shall set forth the specific findings of fact and conclusions of\r\n  law to support the courtâ€™s decision.â€Â  However, we note not every violation of\r\n  Rule 26(a) requires reversal. Â See,\r\n    e.g., Holcombe v. Hardee, 304\r\n  S.C. 522, 524, 405 S.E.2d 821, 822 (1991); Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C.\r\n  85, 98-99, 561 S.E.2d 610, 617 (Ct. App. 2002); Griffith v. Griffith,\r\n  332 S.C. 630, 646-47, 506 S.E.2d 526, 535 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  â€œ[W]hen an order\r\n  from the family court is issued in violation of Rule 26(a), SCRFC, the\r\n  appellate court â€˜may remand the matter to the trial court or, where the record\r\n  is sufficient, make its own findings of fact in accordance with the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence.â€™â€ Griffith, 332 S.C. at 646-47, 506 S.E.2d\r\n  at 535 (quoting Holcombe v. Hardee, 304 S.C. at 524, 405 S.E.2d at 822).\r\n  Â In the case sub judice, we find the record on appeal sufficient\r\n  for this court to make its own findings.  \r\nIn\r\n  asserting the family court erred by failing to make the specific findings of\r\n  fact as required by Rule 26(a), Wife references the family courtâ€™s order\r\n  rendered in response to her notice of motion and motion for reconsideration. Â Â The\r\n  order denying Wifeâ€™s motion to reconsider references â€œmatters appearing of\r\n  record in the file . . . .â€Â  Therefore, we find it unnecessary for this order\r\n  to set forth factual findings and conclusions of law in light of the original\r\n  divorce decreeâ€™s specific findings of fact and conclusions of law to support\r\n  its decision.Â  Furthermore, as aforementioned, we found the family court, in\r\n  the final divorce decree, properly considered the factors set forth in section\r\n  20-3-130(C) in its final divorce decree decision of whether to award alimony\r\n  and when payments would begin.Â  For that reason, the family court satisfied\r\n  Rule 26(a), SCRFC, and the divorce decree was part of the record on appeal. Therefore,\r\n  we find sufficient facts in the record support the family courtâ€™s order denying\r\n  Wife retroactive alimony.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the family courtâ€™s order in\r\n  response to Wifeâ€™s motion for reconsideration.Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the\r\n  family court properly considered the alimony factors set forth by statute and\r\n  case law in setting an alimony award and in determining when such payments\r\n  should begin.Â  Therefore we find the family court did not abuse its discretion\r\n  in denying Wife retroactive alimony to the date of the temporary hearing.Â \r\n  Additionally, we believe the family court satisfied Rule 26(a), SCRFC in its\r\n  final decree of divorce, which was part of the record on appeal.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the order of the family court is  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, SHORT and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Wife testified she took out a loan from the bank to\r\n  â€œhelp pay my bills,â€ but indicated the loan had only one year remaining before\r\n  she paid it off.Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-166","title":"State v.

Player, Esquire; Debra C. Galloway, of Columbia, for\r\n  Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tS. Jahue Moore, of W. Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  Thomas Sims, III alleges the Master in Equity committed error in granting the Respondents\r\n  (PWI) a preliminary injunction, which enjoined him from violating the terms of\r\n  a non-compete agreement between him and PWI and in failing to require PWI to\r\n  post a bond pursuant to Rule 65, SCRCP. Â We reverse and remand.[1]  \r\nFACTS\r\nPWI is in\r\n  the communications business, and Sims worked for them.Â  In July of 2005, PWI\r\n  presented a non-compete agreement to Sims, which Sims signed.Â  The agreement\r\n  provided: â€œWhile I am employed by the Company, and for 3 yearsâ€¦ afterward, I\r\n  will not compete with the business of the Company . . ., within a radius of 600\r\n  miles from the present location of the Company.â€Â  Sims continued to work for\r\n  PWI until March 10, 2006.Â  After his employment with PWI ended, he began\r\n  working for Computer Components, Inc. (CCI), one of PWIâ€™s largest customers.Â \r\n  Sims performed similar services for CCI as those he previously provided CCI\r\n  while employed by PWI.Â  As a result of Sims activities, PWI allegedly no longer\r\n  received business from CCI.\r\nOn\r\n  August 7, 2006, PWI and its owners, Randy and Denise Cochran, filed suit against\r\n  Sims and CCI seeking monetary damages and both preliminary and permanent\r\n  injunctive relief to enforce the terms of the agreement not to compete.Â  By\r\n  order signed December 11, 2006, the Master granted a preliminary injunction\r\n  against Sims, enjoining him â€œfrom violating the employee non-compete agreement\r\n  to the extent that he shall not solicit or attempt to solicit any business or\r\n  trade from [PWIâ€™s] customers or clients until further Order of this Court.â€ Â The\r\n  Master also refused to set a bond as required by Rule 65(c), SCRCP.Â  This\r\n  appeal follows. Â Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe granting of temporary injunctive relief is within\r\n  the sound discretion of the trial court and will\r\n  not be overturned absent an abuse of that discretion.â€ City of Columbia v. Pic-A-Flick Video, Inc., 340 S.C. 278, 282, 531 S.E.2d 518, 520-21 (2000).\r\n  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when a trial courtâ€™s decision is unsupported by\r\n  the evidence or controlled by an error of law.â€ County of Richland v. Simpkins, 348 S.C. 664, 668, 560 S.E.2d 902, 904 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe\r\n  Supreme Court of South Carolina recently addressed injunctive relief:\r\n\r\n\tThe power of\r\n  the court to grant an injunction is in equity. The court will reserve its\r\n  equitable powers for situations when there is no adequate remedy at law. The\r\n  party seeking an injunction has the burden of demonstrating facts and\r\n  circumstances warranting an injunction. The remedy of an injunction is a\r\n  drastic one and ought to be applied with caution. In deciding whether to grant\r\n  an injunction, the court must balance the benefit of an injunction to the\r\n  plaintiff against the inconvenience and damage to the defendant, and grant an\r\n  injunction which seems most consistent with justice and equity under the\r\n  circumstances of the case. \r\n\tFor a preliminary injunction to be granted, the plaintiff must establish\r\n  that (1) it would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted; (2)\r\n  the party seeking injunction will likely succeed in the litigation; and (3)\r\n  there is an inadequate remedy at law. \r\n\r\n\r\n    Strategic Resources Co. v. BCS Life Ins. Co., 367 S.C. 540, 544, 627\r\n  S.E.2d 687, 689&nbsp;(2006) (internal citations omitted).Â  This court has also\r\n  addressed injunctive relief, noting:  \r\n\r\n\t[i]t is well settled that, in determining whether a\r\n  temporary injunction should issue, the merits of the case are not to be\r\n  considered, except in so far as they may enable the court to determine whether\r\n  a prima facie showing has been made. When a prima facie showing has been made\r\n  entitling plaintiff to injunctive relief, a temporary injunction will be\r\n  granted without regard to the ultimate termination of the case on the merits.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MailSource, LLC v. M.A. Bailey &amp; Assocs., 356 S.C. 363, 368, 588\r\n  S.E.2d 635, 638&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003) (internal citations omitted).\r\nWe are aware that in determining whether a temporary\r\n  injunction should be granted, the merits of the case should not be considered beyond\r\n  determining whether a prima facie showing has been made.Â  However, as noted by\r\n  the Supreme Court in Strategic Resources, the party seeking injunctive\r\n  relief must establish it will likely succeed on the merits.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  review whether PWI has made a prima facie showing of the likelihood of succeeding\r\n  on the merits.Â  Following our review, we have concluded that PWI failed to make\r\n  this showing. Â Â Â This\r\n  Court addressed the enforceability of covenants not to compete in Faces\r\n    Boutique, Ltd. v. Gibbs, where we stated:\r\n\r\n\tCovenants\r\n  not to compete contained in employment contracts are generally disfavored and\r\n  will be strictly construed against the employer. Â A restriction against competition must be narrowly drawn to\r\n  protect the legitimate interests of the employer. Â A covenant not to compete\r\n  will be upheld only if it is:\r\n\t(1) necessary for the protection of the legitimate\r\n  interest of the employer;\r\n\t(2)\r\n  reasonably limited in its operation with respect to time and place;\r\n\t(3) not\r\n  unduly harsh and oppressive in curtailing the legitimate efforts of the\r\n  employee to earn a livelihood;\r\n\t(4)\r\n  reasonable from the standpoint of sound public policy; and\r\n\t(5)\r\n  supported by valuable consideration.\r\n\tMoreover, each case concerned\r\n  with the enforceability of covenants not to compete contained in employment contracts\r\n  must be decided on its own facts. If a covenant not to compete is defective in\r\n  one of the above referenced areas, the covenant is totally defective and cannot\r\n  be saved.\r\n\r\n318 S.C. 39, 41-42, 455 S.E.2d 707, 708-09&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 1995) (internal citations omitted).\r\nIn\r\n  the case sub judice, we are troubled by the broad geographical scope and effective\r\n  time period of the non-compete agreement.Â  The terms of the agreement restrict\r\n  Simsâ€™ business activities within a 600 mile radius of Lexington, South Carolina, for three years following the completion of his employment with PWI.Â  The\r\n  agreement, if enforceable, would bar Simsâ€™ business activities in thirteen\r\n  states fully and in parts of nine other states.Â  While the agreement bars Sims\r\n  activities in at least part of twenty-two states, PWI only conducted business\r\n  in five states.Â  For these reasons, we are doubtful of the enforceability of\r\n  this agreement.Â  See Â Poole v. Incentives Unlimited, Inc., 345 S.C. 378, 548 S.E.2d 207 (2001) (holding that a covenant not to compete is\r\n  enforceable if it is not detrimental to the public interest, is reasonably limited as to time and territory, and is supported by valuable\r\n  consideration).Â   \r\nTo be entitled to injunctive relief, PWI must establish it would\r\n  suffer irreparable harm without such relief.Â  We find no such showing.Â  Generally,\r\n  pure economic loss is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement of showing an\r\n  irreparable harm where an adequate remedy is available at law.Â  See MailSource, LLC,\r\n  356 S.C. at 370, 588 S.E.2d at 639 (stating the â€œgeneral rule is that an\r\n  injunction should be granted only where some irreparable injury is threatened\r\n  for which there is no adequate remedy at lawâ€).Â  However, this Court has recognized an irreparable harm\r\n  where economic loss threatens the plaintiffâ€™s business as a whole. See Peek v. Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System,&nbsp;367 S.C. 450, 455-56, 626 S.E.2d 34,\r\n  37&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005) (holding â€œthe complete loss of a professional practice\r\n  can be an irreparable harmâ€).Â   \r\nPWI\r\n  failed to allege any irreparable harm arising from Simsâ€™ business activities.Â  Randy Cochran, one of PWIâ€™s owners and its president, testified PWI\r\n  no longer conducted business with CCI, one of its largest customers, as a\r\n  result of Simsâ€™ activities.Â  Cochran alleged the lost business represented\r\n  approximately thirty percent of PWIâ€™s overall business.Â  However, PWI failed to\r\n  allege or present any evidence that Simsâ€™ activities could cause the complete\r\n  loss of business for PWI.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  only allegation of irreparable harm in this case is contained in the\r\n  non-compete agreement itself.Â  The agreement states:  \r\n\r\n\t3.Â \r\n  Injunctive Relief. Â I acknowledge and\r\n  agree that in the event of a violation or threatened violation of any\r\n  provisions of this agreement, the Company will sustain irreparable harm and\r\n  will have the full right to seek injunctive relief, in addition to any other\r\n  legal remedy available, without the requirement of posting bond.\r\n\r\nWe are not satisfied that language\r\n  in the challenged agreement alone constitutes a sufficient showing of\r\n  irreparable harm, particularly when considering the overly broad scope of the\r\n  agreement. Â See Faces Boutique, Ltd. 318 S.C. at 42, 455 S.E.2d\r\n  at 709 (holding: â€œIf a covenant not to compete is defective in one . . . area[],\r\n  the covenant is totally defective and cannot be saved.â€).Â  Accordingly, we find\r\n  the Master erred in finding PWI had satisfied the requirement of showing\r\n  irreparable harm, and therefore, the preliminary injunction should not have\r\n  been granted.  \r\nSims also claims the Master committed error in failing to require\r\n  PWI to pay a bond pursuant to Rule 65(c), SCRCP.Â  We agree.Â   \r\n\r\n\tRule 65(c), SCRCP, provides:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tno restraining order or temporary\r\n  injunction shall issue except upon the giving of security by the applicant, in\r\n  such sum as the court deems proper, for the payment of such costs and damages\r\n  as may be incurred or suffered by any party who is found to have been\r\n  wrongfully enjoined or restrained.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPWI argues the â€œdeems properâ€\r\n  language of Rule 65, SCRCP, provides the Master with discretion to set no bond\r\n  at all.Â  PWI also argues the language of the non-compete argument, which states\r\n  PWI has a right to seek injunctive relief â€œwithout the requirement of posting\r\n  bond,â€ justifies the Masterâ€™s refusal to set bond.Â  We are not persuaded by\r\n  either argument.Â Â Â   \r\nIn Atwood Agency\r\n  v. Black, 374 SC 68, 646 S.E.2d 882,&nbsp;(2007), the Supreme Court of\r\n  South Carolina recently addressed the issue of the discretion provided to trial\r\n  courts by Rule 65, SCRCP.Â  Atwood Agency is a vacation rental business on Edisto Island, South Carolina.Â  Elaine Shaw was employed by Atwood Agency for fifteen\r\n  years.Â  When Shawâ€™s employment with Atwood Agency ended, she went to work for\r\n  another vacation rental business, Edisto Sales and Rental Realty, Inc.Â  Atwood Agency\r\n  filed suit against Shaw and her new employer.Â  The circuit court granted Atwood\r\n  Agency a temporary injunction, restraining Shaw and her employer from\r\n  contacting or contracting with Atwoodâ€™s clients.Â  The court set bond in the\r\n  amount of $250.Â   \r\nShaw\r\n  and her employer challenged the underlying temporary injunction and argued the\r\n  amount of bond was inadequate. Â The Supreme Court reversed and remanded, explaining:\r\n  â€œ[t]he circuit courtâ€™s order requiring only a nominal security bond does not\r\n  satisfy Rule 65(c) because it erroneously assumes the injunction is proper\r\n  instead of providing an amount sufficient to protect appellants in the event\r\n  the injunction is ultimately deemed improper.â€Â  374 SC 68, 78, 646 S.E.2d 882,\r\n  884. Â The Supreme Court ruled Shaw and her employer had been improperly\r\n  enjoined and remanded the matter back â€œto the circuit court to award the\r\n  appropriate amount of costs and damages incurred as a result of the temporary\r\n  injunction.â€ Id.  \r\nWe find that if\r\n  setting nominal bond is not within the discretion of the trial court, setting\r\n  no bond is likewise beyond the trial courtâ€™s discretion.Â  Furthermore, to allow\r\n  the language of the non-compete argument to control whether a bond is required\r\n  would impose the same flawed reasoning upon Sims as that rejected in Atwood:\r\n  to â€œerroneously assume[] the injunction is proper instead of providing an\r\n  amount sufficient to protect appellants in the event the injunction is\r\n  ultimately deemed improper.â€Â  Id.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons\r\n  stated above, we reverse the Masterâ€™s grant of a preliminary injunction and\r\n  remand the matter back to the Master for further proceedings to determine if\r\n  Sims has incurred any cost or suffered any damages as a result of the improper\r\n  injunction and to award appropriate relief.Â  Accordingly, the order of the\r\n  Master is\r\nREVERSED and\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON, SHORT,\r\n  and THOMAS JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-174","title":"State v.

Zelenka, Assistant\r\n  Attorney General S. Creighton Waters, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Robert M.\r\n  Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Marlon\r\n  Rivera appeals his murder conviction, arguing the trial judge erred in (1)\r\n  admitting his statement to police, (2) admitting hearsay testimony, (3)\r\n  refusing to allow an unsequestered witness to testify, and (4) failing to\r\n  charge accident and involuntary manslaughter.Â  We reverse and remand.Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nThis case involves the killing of Wilfredo Solis Monge.Â \r\n  At approximately 12:30 a.m. on July 18, 2005, police officers arrived at the\r\n  scene of a reported shooting in Greenville County.Â  There were a number of\r\n  people at the scene, most of whom only spoke Spanish.Â  When police arrived, Monge\r\n  was lying on the ground.Â  After the paramedics took Monge to the hospital, detectives\r\n  were called to the scene.Â   \r\nPolice attempted\r\n  to speak with witnesses at the scene and one witness informed the police the\r\n  shooter was two blocks away in a nearby bar. Â Police accompanied the witness to\r\n  the bar, where the witness subsequently identified Rivera as the person who\r\n  shot Monge.Â  Officers then placed Rivera in custody.Â   \r\nOfficers took\r\n  Rivera to the law enforcement center to be interviewed.Â  Although Rivera does\r\n  not speak English, a Spanish-speaking officer was present to inform Rivera of\r\n  his rights and translate his statements.Â  The officer explained Riveraâ€™s\r\n  rights, and Rivera subsequently signed a written waiver of rights form.Â  During\r\n  the interview, Rivera gave a statement to police. Â The translated version of\r\n  the statement indicates Rivera admitted to shooting Monge.Â  After the\r\n  interview, the Spanish-speaking officer and Investigator Smith escorted Rivera\r\n  to the detention center.  \r\nAt\r\n  trial, the State offered evidence supporting Riveraâ€™s guilt, including Riveraâ€™s\r\n  confession to police. Â The trial judge admitted the statement following a\r\n  hearing on its admissibility.Â  The State also offered evidence of the statement\r\n  made by Rivera while officers were escorting him to the detention center.Â  \r\n \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the State offered the testimony of Nelson Castro, Riveraâ€™s cousin, who\r\n  testified that on the night of the shooting, Rivera arrived at his residence\r\n  and informed him he had killed someone.Â  Castro further testified Rivera told\r\n  him he was wrestling with someone else and the firearm â€œjust went off by\r\n  itself.â€  \r\nUpon taking the\r\n  stand, Rivera denied shooting Monge.Â  He also offered the testimony of several\r\n  witnesses, including Carlos Freeman, who had been serving as his interpreter to\r\n  corroborate the testimony of other witnesses.Â  The trial judge refused\r\n  to allow Freeman to testify because he had been in the courtroom for the\r\n  entirety of the trial in violation of the sequestration order which Rivera\r\n  himself requested.Â   \r\nAfter all of the\r\n  evidence had been presented, Rivera requested the jury be charged on\r\n  self-defense, accident, and involuntary manslaughter.Â  The trial judge denied\r\n  Riveraâ€™s request.Â  Rivera was convicted of murder and sentenced to thirty years\r\n  imprisonment.Â  This appeal followed.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nRivera\r\n  argues the trial judge erred by ruling Rivera was not entitled to a jury\r\n  instruction on involuntary manslaughter.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œThe law to be charged must be determined from the evidence\r\n  presented at trial.â€Â  State v. Patterson, 367 S.C. 219, 231, 625\r\n  S.E.2d 239, 245 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  â€œIf any evidence supports a requested jury charge, the trial court should\r\n  grant the request.â€ Â State v. Ward, 374 S.C. 606, 614, 649 S.E.2d 145, 149&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 2007) (citing State v. Brown, 362 S.C. 258, 262, 607 S.E.2d 93, 95\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004)). Â â€œDue\r\n  process requires that a lesser included offense be charged when the evidence\r\n  warrants it but only if the evidence would permit a jury rationally to find the\r\n  defendant guilty of the lesser offense.â€Â  State v. Small, 307 S.C. 92,\r\n  94, 413 S.E.2d 870, 871 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  â€œTo warrant reversal, a trial court's\r\n  refusal to give a requested jury charge must be both\r\n  erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant.â€ Â Patterson, 367 S.C. at 232, 625 S.E.2d at 245. \r\n \r\nRivera\r\n  relies upon the testimony of Nelson Castro, a witness for the prosecution, who\r\n  stated Rivera had told Castro the shooting occurred while Rivera was wrestling\r\n  with another man and the gun accidentally discharged.Â  During his testimony,\r\n  Castro stated specifically: â€œHe said that when they were wrestling both of them\r\n  were grabbing the pistol.Â  And what he told me is that the other one, one had\r\n  grabbed the pistol away from him.Â  And in that the shot went off.â€Â  This\r\n  testimony is substantially different from that of Rivera himself.Â  Rivera\r\n  testified that during the fight the gun slipped inside of his pants and started\r\n  falling down his pant leg until it fell out onto the ground.Â  He then testified\r\n  that both he and the assailant went after the gun, but he got it first and shot\r\n  twice toward the ground in order to scare the assailant.Â  He further stated\r\n  that at that point another man whom he knew as â€œSkinnyâ€ grabbed the gun and\r\n  shot one time in the direction of Mauricio and then gave the gun back.Â  Once\r\n  they realized someone had been hit by the gunfire they ran from the scene.\r\nRiveraâ€™s\r\n  testimony at trial not only differs from Castroâ€™s testimony but also differs\r\n  substantially from the statement Rivera originally gave to investigating\r\n  officers.Â  Riveraâ€™s statement to the officers admits to grabbing the weapon, pointing\r\n  it at his assailant, and firing it two times.Â  In his statement to\r\n  investigators, Rivera fails to mention or identify anyone other than himself\r\n  firing the weapon.\r\nWhile\r\n  Riveraâ€™s testimony at trial differed from his signed statement, defense witnesses\r\n  Courtney Robles and Norberto Ortiz corroborated Riveraâ€™s trial testimony.Â  Robles\r\n  testified that a guy in a striped shirt was fighting a guy in a white shirt.Â \r\n  Then a guy in a black shirt got the gun from the guy in the striped shirt and\r\n  fired it towards the guy in the white shirt.Â  She further stated that she could\r\n  not remember specifics about these three menâ€™s appearances other than their\r\n  general characteristics and the clothes they were wearing.Â  Ortiz, an\r\n  acquaintance of Rivera, testified that Rivera only fired the weapon towards the\r\n  ground and that another guy whom he did not know grabbed the weapon and fired\r\n  it towards the man who had been fighting with Rivera.  \r\nInvoluntary manslaughter is defined as (1) the unintentional killing of\r\n  another without malice, but while engaged in an unlawful activity not naturally\r\n  tending to cause death or great bodily harm; or (2) the unintentional killing\r\n  of another without malice, while engaged in a lawful activity with reckless\r\n  disregard for the safety of others. Â State v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527,\r\n  571, 647 S.E.2d 144, 167 (2007).Â   \r\nWhile there are several inconsistent explanations for the fatal\r\n  shot in this case, including the testimony by Rivera that he was not the actual\r\n  shooter, Castroâ€™s testimony would support a jury finding the weapon discharged\r\n  during a struggle over the weapon.Â  Despite the disparity of evidence and\r\n  conflicting versions of the facts presented by Rivera, all of the evidence\r\n  including Riveraâ€™s inconsistent statements must be viewed in the light most\r\n  favorable to the defendant.Â  See State v. Knoten, 347 S.C.\r\n  296, 555 S.E.2d 391 (2001).Â  Moreover, Rivera admits to firing the weapon\r\n  towards the ground.Â  The discharge of a firearm in a public area is evidence of\r\n  recklessness in the absence of self-defense.Â  â€œThe fact that there may have been evidence showing the shooting was\r\n  intentional did not negate the other inferences that could be drawn from all\r\n  the evidence.â€Â  State v. Mekler, 368 S.C. 1, 16, 626 S.E.2d 890,\r\n  898&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005), cert. granted (2007).Â  Evidence a weapon\r\n  discharged during a struggle is sufficient for submission of an involuntary\r\n  manslaughter instruction to the jury. Â Casey v. State, 305 S.C. 445,\r\n  447, 409 S.E.2d 391, 392&nbsp;(1991).Â  If the jury believed the testimony of\r\n  Castro, it could find the gun was fired during a struggle between Rivera and\r\n  another party and conclude Rivera was guilty of involuntary manslaughter. â€œTo\r\n  warrant a courtâ€™s eliminating the offense of manslaughter, it should very\r\n  clearly appear that there is no evidence whatsoever tending to reduce the crime\r\n  from murder to manslaughter.â€ State v. Cole, 338 S.C. 97, 101, 525\r\n  S.E.2d 511, 513 (2000).Â  It is not our province on review to decide which\r\n  testimony to believe; the jury must determine the facts and resolve any issues\r\n  of credibility.\r\nHere,\r\n  there is some evidence supporting an involuntary manslaughter charge.Â  The\r\n  failure to submit this charge to the jury prejudiced Rivera and warrants a new\r\n  trial.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial judge erred\r\n  in failing to instruct the jury on involuntary manslaughter and Rivera was\r\n  prejudiced by this error; thus, he is entitled to a new trial.Â  Furthermore, in\r\n  light of our disposition of the issue pertaining to the trial judgeâ€™s refusal\r\n  to charge the jury on involuntary manslaughter, the remaining issues on appeal are\r\n  not dispositive and need not be addressed.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County School Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (appellate\r\n  court need not address remaining issues when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).Â  Accordingly, Riveraâ€™s conviction is\r\nREVERSED and\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J.,\r\n  PIEPER, J., and CURETON, A.J. concur.\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-188","title":"State v.

McIntosh, and Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J.\r\n  Zelenka, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg,\r\n  for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  David\r\n  Dwight Smith (Smith) was convicted of murder and possession of a firearm during\r\n  the commission of a violent crime.Â  He asserts on appeal the trial judge erred\r\n  in refusing to instruct the jury on: 1) voluntary manslaughter, 2) involuntary\r\n  manslaughter, and 3) accident.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nSmith was indicted for murder and possession of a firearm during the\r\n  commission of a violent crime.Â  The charges arose from the January 12, 1997\r\n  shooting of Robert Finley (Finley). At trial, the jury found Smith guilty of\r\n  both charges and the judge sentenced him to life imprisonment for murder and\r\n  five years, concurrent, for possession of a firearm during the commission of a\r\n  violent crime.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSmith\r\n  unsuccessfully appealed his case and then filed an application for\r\n  post-conviction relief (PCR) alleging (1) ineffective assistance of counsel and\r\n  (2) failure to call an expert witness.Â  After a hearing, the judge granted\r\n  Smith post-conviction relief. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSmith was\r\n  retried on October 31, 2005.Â  The jury found him guilty of both charges. The\r\n  judge sentenced him to imprisonment for thirty-five years for murder and five\r\n  years, concurrent, for possession of a firearm during the commission of a\r\n  violent crime. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAt trial,\r\n  testimony revealed that at approximately 2:30 a.m. on the night in question\r\n  Finley walked to Otis Hyderâ€™s (Hyder) mobile home to use his phone.Â  Finley\r\n  wanted to purchase some crack cocaine and called a dealer, Rodney Smith\r\n  (Rodney).[1] Â Rodney refused to help Finley, but Rodneyâ€™s sister, Angie Smith (Angie),\r\n  volunteered to set up a drug buy between Finley and another dealer, Smith.Â \r\n  Smith picked Angie up at home and the two drove to meet Finley at Otis Hyderâ€™s\r\n  mobile home. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nInitially,\r\n  Smith stayed in the car while Angie entered Hyderâ€™s trailer. She attempted to\r\n  facilitate the drug deal, but Finley wanted to deal with Smith directly. Â Angie\r\n  returned to the car and informed Smith of the situation.Â  Smith walked into the\r\n  trailer; once inside Smith realized Finley did not have money for the deal and\r\n  that Finley insisted on keeping the drugs.Â  Smith testified that Finley tried\r\n  to rob him.Â  The situation escalated into a fight and struggle over control of\r\n  a firearm that was in Smithâ€™s possession.Â  During the fight, the firearm\r\n  discharged striking Finley in the left eye killing him. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDuring the first trial, Judge Derham Cole charged the jury on the law\r\n  of voluntary manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter, and accident, the three\r\n  charges at issue in this appeal.Â  In the case at hand, Judge Jack Early charged\r\n  the jury on murder and self-defense. In addition, Smith requested charges on voluntary\r\n  manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter, and accident, which the judge denied.\r\n\r\n  \r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  â€œIn\r\n    criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.â€ State\r\n      v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001); State v.\r\n        Wood, 362 S.C. 520, 525, 608 S.E.2d 435, 438 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Generally,\r\n    the trial judge is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina.Â  Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 665, 594 S.E.2d 462, 472-73\r\n    (2004); State v. Brown, 362 S.C. 258, 261-62, 607 S.E.2d 93, 95 (Ct.\r\n    App. 2004). â€œThe law\r\n    to be charged must be determined from the evidence presented at trial.â€Â  State\r\n      v. Patterson, 367 S.C. 219, 231, 625 S.E.2d 239, 245 (Ct. App. 2006).Â \r\n    If any evidence supports a jury charge, the trial judge should grant the\r\n    request.Â  Brown, 362 S.C. at 262, 607 S.E.2d at 95.Â  â€œDue process\r\n    requires that a lesser included offense be charged when the evidence warrants\r\n    it but only if the evidence would permit a jury rationally to find the\r\n    defendant guilty of the lesser offense.â€Â  State v. Small, 307 S.C. 92,\r\n    94, 413 S.E.2d 870, 871 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  â€œTo warrant reversal, a trial court's\r\n    refusal to give a requested jury charge must be both\r\n    erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant.â€ Â Patterson, 367 S.C. at 232, 625 S.E.2d at 245.\r\n    Â \r\n  DISCUSSION\r\n  ISSUE:\r\n  Did the trial judge err in refusing to charge\r\n    voluntary manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter, and accident?\r\n  Voluntary Manslaughter\r\n  First, Smith contends that his murder conviction should be\r\n    reversed and remanded for a new trial based on the trial judgeâ€™s failure to\r\n    charge the jury on the law of voluntary manslaughter.Â  We agree.\r\n  Voluntary manslaughter is defined as the â€œunlawful\r\n    killing of a human being in the sudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal\r\n    provocation.â€ State v. Knoten, 347 S.C. 296, 302, 555 S.E.2d 391,\r\n    394 (2001).Â  Both heat of passion and sufficient legal provocation must be\r\n    present for the killing to constitute voluntary manslaughter. Id. at\r\n    302, 555 S.E.2d at 394; State v. Cole, 338 S.C. 97, 101-02, 525\r\n    S.E.2d 511, 513 (2000).\r\n  â€œ[T]o warrant the\r\n    Court in eliminating the offense of manslaughter it should very clearly appear\r\n    that there is no evidence whatsoever tending to reduce the crime from murder to\r\n    manslaughter.â€ State v. Gardner, 219 S.C. 97, 64 S.E.2d 130, 134\r\n    (1951) (citing State v. Norton, 28 S.C. 572, 6 S.E. 820 (1888)).\r\n    Moreover, South Carolina case law consistently holds that a request to charge a\r\n    lesser included offense is properly refused only when there is no evidence that\r\n    the defendant committed the lesser rather than the greater offense. Â See State v. Goldenbaum, 294 S.C. 455, 457, 365 S.E.2d 731, 732\r\n    (1988).Â  â€œIn determining\r\n    whether the evidence requires a charge on voluntary manslaughter, this Court\r\n    must view the facts in the light most favorable to\r\n    the defendant.â€ Cole, 338 S.C. at 101, 525 S.E.2d at 512-13 (citing State\r\n      v. Byrd, 323 S.C. 319, 474 S.E.2d 430 (1996)).\r\n  The\r\n    record supports a charge on the law of voluntary manslaughter.Â  Smith claims the\r\n    victim was attempting to rob him thereby provoking the altercation which he\r\n    ultimately claims caused the alleged accidental shooting.Â  Smith specifically\r\n    testified that Finley â€œwas coming toward me, the expression on his face and\r\n    everything was a real serious demeanor, and I, you know, I didnâ€™t know what to\r\n    expect from him next: . . . [h]e looked like he was on something.â€ Â Smith\r\n    further stated, â€œ[a]s I said, he had this look about him, and he was\r\n    approaching me.Â  So, I took the gun out of my pocket hoping that if he saw it,\r\n    that maybe he would cease.â€ Â Smith also testified that Finley â€œtries to knock\r\n    the gun out my hand.Â  He hit me with the left, with the left arm and grabbed me\r\n    in my collar of the jacket . . . I thought I was gonna lose the gun.Â  He had\r\n    hit it and I got the grip on the gun and heâ€™s got me . . . I went to defend\r\n    myself.Â  I threw my left arm over his, over his arm that he had me grab, and I\r\n    hit him with the butt of the gun. . . . I was trying to get out of there . . . He\r\n    was coming up on me, I was afraid. . . . I was hitting him with the gun and it\r\n    went off and hit him in the face.â€Â   \r\n  This testimony, coupled with the testimony of Angie who described\r\n    the encounter right before the shot was fired as two men scuffling and falling\r\n    out of the trailer door, sufficiently depicts a fight between Finley and Smith immediately\r\n    preceding the shooting and after Smith claimed Finley was trying to rob him.Â  Thus,\r\n    the record contains testimony from Smith that Finley initiated the physical\r\n    confrontation by trying to rob him and aggressively approaching him.Â  Smith\r\n    testified he was trying to escape the situation and feared Finley would gain\r\n    possession of the firearm.Â  Moreover, Smith testified that the discharge of the\r\n    pistol was a â€œ[f]luke accident.Â  I was hitting him with the gun and it went off\r\n    and hit him in the face.â€Â  Smith testified â€œI didnâ€™t intend to use it, and I\r\n    never pointed it at him.â€  \r\n  The trial judge, in denying Smithâ€™s request to charge voluntary\r\n    manslaughter, determined that there was insufficient evidence to show sudden\r\n    heat of passion although Smith claimed Finley tried to rob him and that they\r\n    were fighting.Â  In State v. Davis, 278 S.C. 544, 298 S.E.2d 778 (1983), the\r\n    court found that a voluntary manslaughter charge was appropriate where â€œa\r\n    witness testified that appellant and the victim had been â€˜fighting.â€™ From this\r\n    circumstance of â€˜provocationâ€™ and â€˜heat of passion,â€™ guilt of voluntary\r\n    manslaughter could be fairly and logically deduced and was thus a proper matter\r\n    for jury determination.â€ Id. at 546, 298 S.E.2d at 779 (citing State\r\n      v. Kahan, 268 S.C. 240, 233 S.E.2d 293 (1977)).\r\n  Viewing the case at hand in the light most favorable to Smith, the\r\n    requested charge is appropriate.Â  Cole, 338 S.C. at 101, 525 S.E.2d at\r\n    513.Â  The trial judge charged self-defense[2] but declined to also charge voluntary manslaughter. If the trial judge\r\n    concluded, as the solicitor argued, that the element of legal provocation could\r\n    not be simultaneously used in support of both self-defense as well as voluntary\r\n    manslaughter, that conclusion nonetheless constitutes legal error.  \r\n  \r\n\tBoth self-defense and the lesser included offense of voluntary\r\n    manslaughter should be submitted to the jury if supported by the evidence. \r\n\tState\r\n      v. Linder, 276 S.C. 304, 278 S.E.2d 335 (1981). The rationale for\r\n    this rule is that the jury may fail to find all the elements of self-defense\r\n    but could find sufficient legal provocation and heat of passion to conclude the\r\n    defendant was guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Id.\r\n\r\n  State v. Gilliam, 296 S.C. 395, 396-97, 373 S.E.2d 596, 597 (1988).Â  \r\n\t \r\n  Further,\r\n    any concern about whether the defendant was acting with presumed malice (or a\r\n    mandatory presumption of malice) as a matter of law because of the alleged\r\n    commission of a felony has recently been answered and revisited by our supreme\r\n    court in Lowry v. State, Op. No. 26436 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Feb. 11,\r\n    2008). In Lowry, the supreme court rejected the presumed malice (substantive\r\n    rule of law) approach to the felony murder rule as unconstitutionally shifting\r\n    the stateâ€™s burden of proof on the issue of malice.Â  The court continues to\r\n    adhere to precedent regarding the alternative inference of malice approach\r\n    suggested in State v. Norris, 285 S.C. 86, 92, 328 S.E.2d 339, 342\r\n    (1985) (overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45,\r\n    406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).Â Â  Any implication of malice arising from an act\r\n    occurring during the commission of a felony may be accepted or rejected by the\r\n    jury as it deems appropriate.\r\n  We,\r\n    therefore, respectfully find the trial judge should have instructed the jury on\r\n    voluntary manslaughter and that Smith was prejudiced by the failure to charge\r\n    the lesser offense.Â  Because we reverse on the issue of voluntary manslaughter,\r\n    we need not address the remaining issues presented. Whiteside v. Cherokee County School Dist.\r\n      No. One, 311 S.C. 335,\r\n    340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (appellate court need not address remaining\r\n    issues when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).\r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  We respectfully conclude the trial court\r\n    erred in refusing to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter; we also find\r\n    that Smith was prejudiced by this error. Â Therefore, we reverse the conviction\r\n    and remand the case to the circuit court for a new trial.Â  Furthermore, in\r\n    reversing Smithâ€™s murder conviction, we must also reverse the conviction for\r\n    possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime because the\r\n    former conviction is a prerequisite to the latter.Â  E.g., S.C. Code Ann.\r\n    Â§ 16-23-490(E) (2003) (noting the additional punishment for possession of a\r\n    firearm during the commission of a violent crime may not be imposed unless the\r\n    defendant is convicted of the underlying violent crime); State v. Taylor, 356 S.C. 227, 235 n.4, 589 S.E.2d 1, 5 n.4 (2003) (noting defendant's\r\n    conviction for possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime\r\n    must be reversed where the court was reversing defendant's murder conviction). Â Based\r\n    on the foregoing, Smithâ€™s convictions are hereby\r\n  REVERSED\r\n    AND REMANDED.\r\n  HUFF\r\n    and PIEPER, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Since the appellant is referred to as â€œSmithâ€\r\n  throughout this order and there are two key witnesses named Rodney Smith and\r\n  Angie Smith, these witnesses will be referred to as Rodney and Angie\r\n  respectively to avoid any confusion.\r\n[2] No issues on appeal have been argued as to the\r\n  judgeâ€™s charge of self-defense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-195","title":"The Nutt Corporation v.

Â Brooks was served on May 29, 1998.Â  On\r\n  July 17, 1998, without responding to the summons and complaint in the\r\n  foreclosure action, Brooks filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in the United\r\n  States District Court for South Carolina, thereby staying the foreclosure\r\n  action.\r\nBrooks included the mortgage debt in her Chapter 13 payment plan,\r\n  noting the payments were $280 or more per month plus 8.25% interest.Â  By\r\n  settlement order dated January 23, 2001, the bankruptcy judge set forth the\r\n  payments that Brooks was to make and further provided that, in the event she\r\n  failed to comply with the order, MidFirst would automatically be entitled to\r\n  relief from the bankruptcy stay by filing an affidavit with the bankruptcy\r\n  court.\r\nOn\r\n  September 10, 2002, the bankruptcy court issued an order finding Brooks defaulted\r\n  on the terms of the settlement order.Â  As a result, the automatic bankruptcy stay\r\n  was lifted, enabling MidFirst to proceed with the foreclosure.Â  In January\r\n  2003, MidFirst filed an amended summons and complaint in the foreclosure\r\n  action.Â  On April 11, 2003, Brooks filed a responsive pleading, inÂ  which she\r\n  denied MidFirst was entitled to the relief it requested and counterclaimed for\r\n  relief under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act, setoff for payments allegedly\r\n  made, slander, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\r\nOn\r\n  November 13, 2005, the parties entered into a consent dismissal under Rule\r\n  40(j), SCRCP.Â  In 2005, they agreed to have the matter restored to the active roster.Â \r\n  The matter was then referred to the Sumter County Master-in-Equity.\r\nOn\r\n  August 8, 2005, MidFirst filed a motion for summary judgment, including with\r\n  the motion an affidavit stating the total debt, excluding costs of the action,\r\n  was $86,585.71.Â  In response, Brooks submitted an affidavit alleging (1)\r\n  MidFirst failed to give her credit for numerous payments; (2) the bankruptcy\r\n  trustee wrongfully returned a number of payments that would have significantly\r\n  reduced her debt: (3) because of numerous assignments of her loan, she was not\r\n  given timely credit for all payments made; (4) MidFirst had made fraudulent\r\n  representations to her regarding its investigation of her account; and (5)\r\n  MidFirstâ€™s alleged mishandling of her account forced her to file bankruptcy,\r\n  thus harming her credit rating and financial reputation.\r\nA hearing on the motion took place on October 12, 2005. Â By order\r\n  dated November 16, 2005, the Master granted summary judgment to MidFirst,\r\n  holding Brooks could not pursue her counterclaims because of lack of standing,\r\n  judicial estoppel, and res judicata.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn reviewing an order of summary judgment, an appellate\r\n  court applies the same standard as that which the circuit court applied in\r\n  determining whether to enter the order.â€Â  Helms Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall\r\n    Co., 363 S.C. 334, 340, 611 S.E.2d 485, 488 (2005).Â  â€œSummary judgment is\r\n  appropriate â€˜if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\r\n  admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\r\n  genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to\r\n  a judgment as a matter of law.â€™ â€ Id. (citing Rule 56, SCRCP).Â  Nevertheless,\r\n  when an appellate court affirms the grant of summary judgment on a particular basis,\r\n  it need not discuss the remaining grounds.Â  Fuller-Ahrens Pâ€™ship v. S.C.\r\n    Depâ€™t of Highways and Pub. Transp., 311 S.C. 177, 182, 427 S.E.2d 920, 923\r\n  (Ct. App. 1987).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBrooks\r\n  argues that, notwithstanding that her inadvertent failure to list certain\r\n  claims and defenses in her Chapter 13 bankruptcy action, equitable factors and principles\r\n  allow her to them against MidFirst in the foreclosure action.Â  She further maintains\r\n  the evidence she presented to the Master regarding these claims and defenses is\r\n  sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether MidFirst is\r\n  entitled to judgment.Â  Assuming without deciding that Brooks has adequately\r\n  preserved this issue for appellate review,[2] we hold the equitable factors and principles on which she relies do not allow\r\n  her to proceed on her counterclaims and defenses.\r\nOnce a debtor files\r\n  for bankruptcy in the federal court, an estate is created that is comprised of\r\n  â€œall legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the\r\n  commencement of the case.â€Â  11 U.S.C.A. Â§541(a)(1) (2004).Â  Upon filing, the\r\n  debtor is required to file a list of all creditors and a schedule of assets and\r\n  liabilities, unless the bankruptcy court orders otherwise.Â  Id. Â§\r\n  521(a)(1)(A)-(B)(i) (Supp. 2007).Â  â€œLegal or equitable interestsâ€ has been broadly\r\n  defined to include causes of action. Â In re Educators Group Health Trust,\r\n  25 F.3d 1281, 1283-84 (5th Cir. 1994) (citation omitted).Â  â€œIf a cause of\r\n  action belongs to the estate, then the trustee has exclusive standing to assert\r\n  the claim.â€Â  Id. at 1284.Â   \r\nWhen\r\n  bankruptcy proceedings close, â€œany assets, including\r\n  claims, that were scheduled by the debtor but not disposed of are deemed\r\n  abandoned and revert to the debtor.â€ Â Tyler House Apartments, Ltd. v.\r\n    U.S., 38 Fed. Cl. 1, 6 (1997).Â  Unscheduled claims, however, remain under\r\n  the control of the bankruptcy trustee.Â  Id. â€œIf a cause of action\r\n  belongs to the estate, then the trustee has exclusive standing to assert the\r\n  claim.â€Â  Educators Group Health Trust, 25 F.3d at 1284.\r\nIn\r\n  the present case, Brooks concedes she failed to include in her Chapter 13\r\n  Bankruptcy Schedule B the defenses and counterclaims she sought to enforce\r\n  against MidFirst in the foreclosure action, but contends this failure was\r\n  inadvertent.Â  She further argues her responsive pleadings â€œwere a matter of\r\n  record prior to the bankruptcy and the simple mistake of not listing should not\r\n  result in the complete loss of [her] right to contest a foreclosure and\r\n  specific defenses of tendered payment when evidence exists the allegations of\r\n  nonpayment are not true.â€Â  As we have noted in the facts and procedural\r\n  background, however, Brooks did not file responsive pleadings until April 11,\r\n  2003, seven months after the bankruptcy stay was lifted. Â Her assertion, then,\r\n  that MidFirst had record notice of her defenses and counterclaims is incorrect\r\n  and cannot support her reliance on equitable factors and principles as grounds to\r\n  pursue the claims and defenses she seeks to pursue in the foreclosure proceeding.Â \r\n \r\nWe\r\n  therefore hold the grant of summary judgment was proper based on the\r\n  determination that Brooks lacked standing to assert the defenses and\r\n  counterclaims that she raised in her responsive pleadings.Â  Because this basis\r\n  is sufficient to support the Masterâ€™s decision, we do not address the other\r\n  grounds for his decision concerning judicial estoppel and res judicata.Â  See Weeks v. McMillan, 291 S.C. 287, 292, 353 S.E.2d 289, 292 (Ct. App.\r\n  1987) (â€œWhere a decision is based on alternative grounds, either of which independent\r\n  of the other is sufficient to support it, the decision will not be reversed\r\n  even if one of the grounds is erroneous.â€).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, SHORT, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  MidFirst acknowledges Brooks raised the issue in her\r\n  memorandum submitted in opposition to the summary judgment motion, but points\r\n  out the Master did not rule on it in his order. Â Although Brooks filed a motion\r\n  for reconsideration, the motion itself is not included in the record on\r\n  appeal.Â  The order denying the motion, which is included in the record does not\r\n  specifically address the argument concerning equitable factors and principles\r\n  that Brooks presents in this appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-197","title":"Rolfe v.

Nettles, Philip Bryan Atkinson, of Florence, for\r\n  Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tRobbie Forrester Gardner, III, of Hartsville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In\r\n  this domestic action, Abigail Rolfe (Wife) appeals the family courtâ€™s\r\n  order reducing alimony payments of William\r\n  Eric Rolfe (Husband) and the failure to award attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  We reverse\r\n  in part and remand in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were married for twenty-six\r\n  years.Â  During the marriage, Husband worked as a mechanic with Sonoco Products\r\n  Corporation (Sonoco), and on the side, he also had a heating and air\r\n  conditioning business.Â  The family court found Husband was the primary source\r\n  of income for the family, but Wife contributed indirectly to the marriage\r\n  through â€œher services as a house wife, mother, and bookkeeper for [Husbandâ€™s]\r\n  heating and air conditioning business.â€Â  After a no-fault divorce proceeding in\r\n  1995, the family court ordered Husband to pay Wife $1,200 per month in\r\n  permanent, periodic alimony based on Husbandâ€™s income potential of $6,000 per\r\n  month.Â   \r\nAfter the divorce was finalized, Husband quit his job with Sonoco and became self-employed in the heating\r\n  and air conditioning repair business.Â  Additionally, Husband remarried on June 29, 1998.Â  In\r\n  November 1999, Husbandâ€™s second wife was diagnosed with breast cancer, and she\r\n  underwent treatment for approximately three years.Â  In May 2005, Husbandâ€™s second\r\n  wife suffered a relapse.Â  Husband petitioned the family court for a reduction\r\n  in the payment of permanent, periodic alimony based on a substantial change in\r\n  circumstances.[1]Â \r\n  The family court reduced Husbandâ€™s alimony payments from $1,200 to $900 per\r\n  month based on his decreased income, Wifeâ€™s unemployment, and the medical\r\n  condition of Husbandâ€™s second wife.Â  Wife appeals.  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn\r\n  appeal from a family court order, this Court has authority to correct errors of\r\n  law and find facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 473, 415 S.E.2d 812, 814\r\n  (1992).Â  However, â€œ[q]uestions concerning alimony rest with the sound\r\n  discretion of the [family] court, whose conclusions will not be disturbed\r\n  absent a showing of abuse of discretion.â€Â  Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C.\r\n  481, 485, 477 S.E.2d 727, 729 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs\r\n  when the family courtâ€™s factual findings are without\r\n  evidentiary support or are based upon an error of law. Â Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Modification of\r\n  Alimony \r\nWife\r\n  contends the family court abused its discretion in reducing Husbandâ€™s alimony\r\n  payment based on (1) Husbandâ€™s underemployment; (2) Wifeâ€™s unemployment; and (3)\r\n  the medical situation of Husbandâ€™s second wife.  \r\n1. Underemployment\r\n  of Husband\r\nWife\r\n  first argues the family court erred in failing to impute income to Husband due\r\n  to his voluntary underemployment.Â  We agree.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  party seeking the change in alimony has the burden to prove an unforeseen change\r\n  in circumstances warranting a modification.Â  Id. at 486, 477 S.E.2d at\r\n  729.Â  â€œSeveral considerations relevant to the initial determination of alimony\r\n  may be applied in the modification context as well, including the partiesâ€™\r\n  standard of living during the marriage, each partyâ€™s earning capacity, and the\r\n  supporting spouseâ€™s ability to continue to support the other spouse.â€Â  Penny\r\n    v. Green, 357 S.C. 583, 589, 594 S.E.2d 171, 174 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court has emphasized it â€œwill closely scrutinize the\r\n  facts of any case wherein a husband . . . voluntarily changes employment so as\r\n  to lessen his earning capacity . . . .â€ Camp v. Camp, 269 S.C. 173, 174,\r\n  236 S.E.2d 814, 815 (1977); see also Kelley, 324 S.C. at 488, 477\r\n  S.E.2d at 731 (â€œ[V]oluntary changes in employment which impact a payor spouseâ€™s\r\n  ability to pay alimony are to be closely scrutinized.â€).Â  In Camp the\r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court, stated â€œWhere the husband has voluntarily\r\n  relinquished a well-paying practice and has taken a position at a modest\r\n  salary, the court may base the amount of alimony upon his capacity to earn\r\n  money, or upon his prospective earnings.â€Â  Camp, 269 S.C. at 175, 236\r\n  S.E.2d at 815 (internal quotations and citations omitted).Â   \r\nRecently,\r\n  the South Carolina Supreme Court held the motive behind voluntary\r\n  underemployment may be a factor when courts consider earning capacity.Â  Arnal\r\n    v. Arnal, 371 S.C. 10, 13, 636 S.E.2d 864, 866 (2006) (â€œThe motive behind any purported\r\n  reduction in income or earning capacity should be considered, but prior South\r\n  Carolina appellate decisions do not preclude a finding of voluntary underemployment\r\n  in instances where a spouse reduces his earning capacity without doing so in\r\n  bad faith.â€).Â \r\n  However, in Arnal, our Supreme Court limited its holding by stating,\r\n  â€œ[A] parent seeking to impute income to the other parent need not establish a\r\n  bad faith motivation to lower a support obligation in order to prove voluntary\r\n  underemployment.â€Â  Arnal, 371 S.C. at 13, 636 S.E.2d at 866.Â  Although\r\n  the facts in Arnal involved reduction of child support payments, because\r\n  voluntary underemployment occurs in the alimony arena as well, we find the situation\r\n  analogous to alimony.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-3-130 (C)(4) and (C)(6) (Supp. 2007) (requiring\r\n  the family court to consider â€œthe employment history and earning potential of each spouseâ€ and â€œthe current and reasonable anticipated earnings of\r\n  both spousesâ€ when awarding alimony) (emphasis added);Â  Messer v. Messer, 359 S.C. 614, 629,\r\n  598 S.E.2d 310, 318 (Ct. App. 2004) (holding â€œa spouse obligated to pay alimony\r\n  may not voluntarily or intentionally change his employment or economic\r\n  circumstances so as to curtail his income and thereby avoid paying alimony or\r\n  child supportâ€); see also Luthi v. Luthi, 289 S.C.\r\n  489, 494, 347 S.E.2d 102, 105 (Ct. App. 1986) (â€œA party may not escape\r\n  liability for alimony by intentionally refusing or failing to work.â€).\r\nHere,\r\n  Husbandâ€™s substantial change in circumstances occurred because of his decision\r\n  to terminate his employment with Sonoco at the age of fifty-one.Â  As a result\r\n  of his early retirement, Husband received $763.90 per month from Sonoco instead\r\n  of $1,292.33 per month, which he would have received had he retired at age\r\n  sixty.Â  Additionally, when Husband quit his job with Sonoco and became self-employed,\r\n  the family court found he had the ability to earn $6,000 per month.Â  Since Husbandâ€™s\r\n  divorce decree, he has advertised little, if at all, and the hours he works per\r\n  week vary between ten to forty hours.Â  When asked if he could work the same\r\n  hours he used to work, Husband responded, â€œI probably could, but I just donâ€™t\r\n  feel like it, to tell the truth.â€Â  Husband cannot escape his current alimony\r\n  obligation based on a desire not to work or an intentional refusal to work less\r\n  than full-time.Â  SeeÂ  Id., 289 S.C. at 494, 347 S.E.2d at 105.Â  \r\n \r\nIn\r\n  addition to his underemployment, Husband openly admitted to under-reporting his\r\n  income on his tax returns and work log.Â  Specifically, Husband admitted, â€œIf\r\n  somebody pays you in cash, you just kind of donâ€™t write it down sometimes.â€Â \r\n  Additionally, Husband stated his tax returns would not reflect those cash\r\n  payments, and his tax returns are inconsistent with his financial declarations.Â \r\n  In his financial declarations, Husband estimated $2,763.90 as his total net\r\n  monthly income and $1,400 as his total monthly expense; therefore, he is financially able to pay his previous alimony obligation,\r\n  especially in light of his under-reporting.Â  Moreover, Husband admitted the\r\n  home where he and his second wife currently reside is in his motherâ€™s name.Â  He\r\n  testified he purchased the home with money he saved from working at Sonoco, and\r\n  the reason the home is titled to husbandâ€™s mother is so he would not lose it if\r\n  he went through another divorce.Â  By Husbandâ€™s estimate, the home is worth\r\n  $80,000, and he does not make house payments on it.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  family court reduced Husbandâ€™s alimony because his early retirement was a goal\r\n  of both parties throughout their marriage.Â  However, we find Husband is\r\n  voluntarily underemployed due to his decision to voluntarily terminate his\r\n  employment with Sonoco and his decision not to work at full capacity in the\r\n  heating and air conditioning business.Â  See Messer, 359 S.C. at 629,\r\n  598 at 318 (holding â€œa spouse obligated to pay alimony may not voluntarily or\r\n  intentionally change his employment or economic circumstances so as to curtail\r\n  his income and thereby avoid paying alimony or child supportâ€); Kelley,\r\n  324 S.C. at 486, 477 S.E.2d at 729-30 (â€œThe following\r\n  circumstances, without more, have been found insufficient to warrant\r\n  modification of alimony: unwarranted debts, inflation, increased or decreased\r\n  income of the payor spouse, a payee spouseâ€™s anticipated employment, and the straitened\r\n  financial situation[s] which are a normal consequence of divorce.â€) (internal\r\n  quotations and citations omitted).\r\n2.&nbsp; Wifeâ€™s Unemployment\r\nWife\r\n  next contends the family erred by taking her unemployment into account in its decision to reduce alimony.Â  We agree.Â  \r\n \r\nAlimony is a substitute for support which is normally\r\n  incidental to the martial relationship.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C.\r\n  289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988). Â Generally, the purpose of\r\n  alimony is to place the supported spouse, to the extent possible, in the\r\n  position she enjoyed during the marriage.Â  Id.Â  In Brown v. Brown,\r\n  the South Carolina Supreme Court refused to reduce alimony payments when a former\r\n  wife accepted a full-time employment position after the divorce.Â  278 S.C. 43,\r\n  44, 292 S.E.2d 297, 297 (1982).Â  The Brown court noted the former wifeâ€™s\r\n  employment was anticipated and, therefore, did not amount to a change in\r\n  circumstances warranting modification in alimony.Â  Id.\r\nIn\r\n  the present case, the family court found alimony was a â€œperfect disincentiveâ€\r\n  for Wifeâ€™s employment.Â  Specifically, the family court stated Wife made no\r\n  serious attempt to gain employment but worked several days a week volunteering.Â \r\n  However, we find Wife is entitled to the level of support she enjoyed prior to\r\n  her divorce from Husband.Â  During the partiesâ€™ twenty-six year marriage, Wife\r\n  did not work outside the home for a number of years even though she has two degrees\r\n  from Coker College.[2]Â  During their marriage, Wife and Husband enjoyed a comfortable\r\n  lifestyle, and they were able to acquire assets without incurring substantial\r\n  debt.Â   \r\nWe\r\n  find Wife is entitled to live in the manner she enjoyed prior to her divorce\r\n  from Husband, and permanent, periodic alimony is designed to ensure Wife can maintain\r\n  that lifestyle.Â  See Johnson, 296 S.C. at 300, 372 S.E.2d at 113 (â€œOrdinarily, the purpose of alimony is to\r\n  place the supported spouse, as nearly as is practical, in the position of\r\n  support she enjoyed during the marriage.â€).Â  Since\r\n  her divorce, Wife has accrued debt and borrowed $50,000 on the marital home she\r\n  received in the divorce.Â  Moreover, as stated in her financial declaration in\r\n  2005, Wifeâ€™s net monthly income, prior to the family courtâ€™s decrease in\r\n  alimony, was $1,794.16 and her expenses totaled $2,530.07.Â  Consequently, even\r\n  with the previous alimony payment of $1,200, Wife was in a strained financial\r\n  situation.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we find the family court abused its discretion by considering Wifeâ€™s\r\n  unemployment in its decision to reduce alimony.Â   \r\n3.Â  Medical Condition and Lack of Insurance for Second\r\n  Spouse\r\nWife next asserts\r\n  the family court erred in concluding the medical condition of Husbandâ€™s second\r\n  wife and her lack of medical insurance justify a reduction in alimony.Â  As\r\n  explained above, Husbandâ€™s\r\n  second wife was diagnosed with breast cancer, and she underwent treatment for\r\n  approximately three years.Â  In May 2005, Husbandâ€™s second wife suffered a\r\n  relapse.Â  Husbandâ€™s second wife testified\r\n  her current outstanding medical bills amount to approximately $15,000, and that\r\n  she is making small payments.Â  Second wife stated that she has been able to\r\n  obtain write offs or receive â€œcare adjustmentsâ€ for her medical expenses.Â  The\r\n  family court found Husbandâ€™s second wifeâ€™s cancer constituted a substantial\r\n  change in condition, noting, â€œthe cost of treatment will be very substantial\r\n  and that the [Husband] will not be able to pay all of the costs associated with\r\n  the treatment.â€Â   \r\nThere\r\n  has been no showing in the record by Husband that he has or will incur any debt\r\n  as a result of his current wifeâ€™s medical condition.Â  Thus, the family court\r\n  improperly considered the medical condition of Husbandâ€™s second wife in\r\n  altering alimony.Â  See Spivey ex rel. Spivey v. Carolina Crawler,\r\n  367 S.C. 154, 160, 624 S.E.2d 435, 438&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005) (holding an\r\n  appellate court examines justiciable controversies, which are real and substantial\r\n  controversies, which are ripe and appropriate for judicial determination instead\r\n  of merely contingent, hypothetical, or abstract disputes and issues that are\r\n  not ripe are not appropriately before this Court).Â  We decline to express an\r\n  opinion on whether it was proper for the family court to assign weight to second\r\n  wifeâ€™s medical condition in altering Husbandâ€™s alimony payments when Husband\r\n  has neither paid nor obligated himself to pay any of second wifeâ€™s medical\r\n  expenses.Â  See Sloan v. Greenville County, 356 S.C. 531, 552, 590\r\n  S.E.2d 338, 349 (Ct. App. 2003) (â€œThe function of appellate courts is not to\r\n  give opinions on merely abstract or theoretical matters, but only to decide\r\n  actual controversies injuriously affecting the rights of some party to the\r\n  litigation.â€).Â   \r\nII.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees and\r\n  Costs\r\nFinally,\r\n  Wife argues the family court erred in failing to award her attorneyâ€™s fees and\r\n  costs.Â  We agree.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  family court has discretion in deciding whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, and\r\n  its decision will not be overturned absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  Patel\r\n    v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 533, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004).Â  Â Â In deciding\r\n  whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court should consider: (1) each\r\n  partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fee; (2) the beneficial results obtained\r\n  by the attorney; (3) the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions; and (4) the\r\n  effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  Id.  \r\nThe\r\n  family court required each party to pay their own attorneyâ€™s fees and costs\r\n  based on the above-mentioned factors.Â  Based on our reversal of the family\r\n  courtâ€™s modification of alimony, Wifeâ€™s beneficial result has changed.Â \r\n  Furthermore, Wife was forced to defend an existing award of alimony because of Husbandâ€™s\r\n  action for modification, which required representation of an attorney.Â \r\n  Therefore, we find it proper to award Wife attorneyâ€™s fees, and we remand this\r\n  issue back to the family court for a determination of an appropriate amount\r\n  based on the factors as set forth in Patel, 359 S.C. at 533, 599 S.E.2d at\r\n  123.[3]Â  See Epperly v.

denying her a special equity interest in Franklin Hinesâ€™ (Husband) businesses and\r\n  awarding her one yearâ€™s rehabilitative alimony and partial attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We\r\n  affirm in part and remand.[1]Â  \r\n \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife (collectively the Hineses) married on February\r\n  14, 1998.Â  Both Husband and Wife had been married previously.Â  The Hineses had\r\n  no children together, though each had children from their previous\r\n  relationships.Â  Husband had owned and operated a funeral home and cemetery\r\n  since 1996.Â  The Hineses met when Wife utilized Husbandâ€™s services following\r\n  her previous husbandâ€™s death.\r\nHusband earned a bachelorâ€™s degree in education.Â  Husband began\r\n  working at the familyâ€™s funeral home in 1973 and inherited it from his mother\r\n  in 1996.Â  Before settling into his familyâ€™s funeral home business, he attended\r\n  college, served in the military, taught school, and worked for the United\r\n  States Postal Service.Â  In addition to the funeral home and cemetery, Husband\r\n  owned several other properties, including a 75% interest in his home.Â  Husband\r\n  was 70 years old at the time of trial.\r\nWife earned a bachelorâ€™s degree in sociology and a masterâ€™s degree\r\n  in public administration.Â  In 1974, Wife worked as a social worker, but she had\r\n  no degree in that area.Â  During her previous marriage, Wife raised the children\r\n  and did not regularly work outside the home after 1989.Â  Her previous husband\r\n  handled all the familyâ€™s finances until his death.Â  Wifeâ€™s net inheritance from\r\n  her previous husband totaled approximately $1.5 million and included her home.Â \r\n  This inheritance supported Wife and her two dependent sons.Â  At the time of\r\n  trial, this inheritance was severely depleted, and Wife possessed less than\r\n  $500,000, most of which lay in home equity and personal property.Â  Wife\r\n  was 49 years old at the time of trial.Â   \r\nDuring their marriage, the Hineses lived primarily in Wifeâ€™s home\r\n  from her former marriage.Â  Husband maintained his own separate home and kept\r\n  his clothes at his house until Wife constructed a closet in her home to accommodate\r\n  his clothes.Â  The Hineses also maintained separate bank accounts, except for\r\n  one joint checking account they used to pay household bills.Â  Both Husband and\r\n  Wife agreed to fund this account.Â  Despite an agreement to split household\r\n  costs evenly, Husband often failed to deposit money into the joint account.Â  As\r\n  a result, Wifeâ€™s funds paid most of the household bills.Â  Wife had poor\r\n  money-management skills and frequently purchased extravagant items with her\r\n  funds.Â  Wife met with a financial consultant who helped her create a budget,\r\n  but she did not adhere to it.Â  Wife attempted unsuccessfully to gain outside\r\n  employment during and after the marriage.Â   \r\nDuring the marriage, Wife helped out at the funeral home and\r\n  cemetery.Â  She did not make financial contributions to Husbandâ€™s business.Â  The\r\n  funeral home compensated Wife for staffing and managing the floral department.Â \r\n  Without compensation, she also drove the limousine four or five times, attended\r\n  funerals, redecorated the funeral home locations at Hartsville and Lamar,\r\n  decorated the office at the cemetery, prepared lunches for Husband and his\r\n  employees, delivered flowers, and generally helped out where needed.Â  Wife also\r\n  made public appearances on behalf of the funeral home.Â  Furthermore, she\r\n  introduced Husband to nationally known religious events in which she already\r\n  participated.Â  When the funeral home later began sponsoring these events, Wife\r\n  arranged television broadcasts of the events.Â  During the marriage, the funeral\r\n  home and cemeteryâ€™s gross sales increased by approximately $342,058,[2] and the overall value of the funeral\r\n  home increased by $396,444.Â   \r\nThe Hineses separated and reconciled five times during the\r\n  marriage, usually due to financial stress.[3]Â \r\n  After their final separation, Wife filed an action for separate maintenance.Â \r\n  The family court tried this matter in June of 2004.Â  On August 5, 2004, the\r\n  family court entered an order granting divorce on the ground of one yearâ€™s\r\n  continuous separation and reserving jurisdiction to determine all other issues\r\n  separately.Â  On January 10, 2005, the family court entered an order awarding\r\n  Wife one year of rehabilitative alimony and partial attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The order\r\n  also denied Wife a special equity interest in Husbandâ€™s funeral home and\r\n  cemetery.Â  Wife filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, which was\r\n  denied.Â  This appeal followed.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Special Equity\r\nWife\r\n  argues the family court erred in declining to award her a special equity\r\n  interest in Husbandâ€™s business.Â  We disagree.Â  Â Â \r\nThe\r\n  family court has jurisdiction to apportion marital property.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-7-472 (Supp. 2007).Â  In determining the most equitable apportionment of\r\n  marital property, the family court must weigh all fifteen statutory factors.Â  Id.Â  Property acquired before the marriage or after entry of a divorce order is not\r\n  marital property and, therefore, is not subject to apportionment.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-7-473(2) (Supp. 2007).Â  However, â€œany increase in value in nonmarital\r\n  property[,] to the extent that the increase resulted directly or indirectly\r\n  from efforts of the other spouse during marriage,â€ is apportionable marital\r\n  property.Â  Â§ 20-7-473(5). Â The increase in value need not derive from the\r\n  non-owner spouseâ€™s financial contributions.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C.\r\n  289, 299, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  The non-owner spouse is\r\n  entitled to an equitable apportionment of any increase in value that results\r\n  from the employment of his or her â€œlabor and skills.â€Â  Id. at 299, 372\r\n  S.E.2d at 113.Â Â   \r\nWe\r\n  find Wife is not entitled to a special equity interest in Husbandâ€™s funeral\r\n  home and cemetery businesses.Â  Husband owned and operated these businesses\r\n  prior to the marriage; thus, the businesses themselves are nonmarital\r\n  property.Â  Although Wife presented evidence that she performed uncompensated\r\n  services in support of the business, she failed to establish a causal connection between her efforts and any\r\n  portion of the increased value of Husbandâ€™s businesses.Â  Therefore, Wife is not\r\n  entitled to a special equity interest in the increased value of those\r\n  businesses.\r\nII.&nbsp; Spousal Support \r\nWife\r\n  argues the family court erred in awarding her one year of rehabilitative\r\n  alimony instead of permanent periodic alimony.Â  We remand this issue to the\r\n  family court to make additional findings as to what special circumstances exist\r\n  to support its award of rehabilitative alimony, or, in the absence of special\r\n  circumstances, to award permanent periodic alimony instead.Â   \r\nAn\r\n  award of alimony rests within the sound discretion of the family court and will\r\n  not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Allen v. Allen,\r\n  347 S.C. 177, Â­Â­Â­183-84, 554 S.E.2d 421, 424 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  An abuse of\r\n  discretion occurs when the conclusions of the family court either lack\r\n  evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of law.Â  Bryson v. Bryson,\r\n  347 S.C. 221, 224, 553 S.E.2d 493, 495 (Ct. App.2001).\r\nAlimony\r\n  is a substitute for the support normally incident to marriage.Â  Allen,\r\n  347 S.C. at 184, 554 S.E.2d at 424.Â  The purpose of alimony is to place the\r\n  supported spouse in a position as near as possible to the position he or she\r\n  enjoyed during the marriage.Â  Id. at 184, 554 S.E.2d at 424.Â  In\r\n  awarding alimony, the family court must weigh all nine statutory factors.Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2007).Â  How much weight to accord each factor is\r\n  within the family courtâ€™s sound discretion.Â  Id.Â  The family court has\r\n  discretion to determine the amount of any alimony award.Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§&nbsp;20-3-130(B)(1) (Supp. 2007).Â  All types of alimony contemplated by\r\n  statute are modifiable and terminable.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130 (Supp.\r\n  2007)Â Â  Furthermore, the family court may impose whatever â€œterms and\r\n  conditionsâ€ on an alimony award â€œas the court may consider just, as appropriate\r\n  under the circumstances.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-170 (Supp. 2007).Â   \r\nWhere\r\n  alimony is appropriate, South Carolina favors permanent periodic alimony over\r\n  the other types of alimony described by statute.Â  Jenkins v. Jenkins,\r\n  345 S.C. 88, 95, 545 S.E.2d 531, 535 (Ct. App. 2001).Â Â Â  Despite this\r\n  preference, South Carolina does recognize rehabilitative alimony in certain\r\n  circumstances. Rehabilitative alimony encourages a dependent spouse to become\r\n  self-supporting after divorce and permits a former spouse to develop his own\r\n  life free from obligations to the dependent spouse.Â  Belton v. Belton,\r\n  325 S.C. 456, 459-60, 481 S.E.2d 174, 176 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œRehabilitative\r\n  alimony may be awarded only upon a showing of special circumstances justifying\r\n  a departure from the normal preference from permanent periodic support.â€Â  Jenkins,\r\n  345 S.C. at 95, 545 S.E.2d at 535.Â   \r\nAn\r\n  award of one year of rehabilitative alimony without a finding of special\r\n  circumstances meriting departure from permanent periodic alimony was improper.Â \r\n  In finding Wife entitled to spousal support, the family court carefully weighed\r\n  the statutory factors, noting in particular the brief term of the marriage,\r\n  numerous separations, and the partiesâ€™ advanced degrees.Â  The family court\r\n  awarded one year of rehabilitative alimony based upon Wifeâ€™s antiquated work\r\n  experience, â€œher degrees, her intelligence and her sophistication.â€Â  However,\r\n  neither party made the showing of special circumstances required for such an\r\n  award, and Wife did not request rehabilitative alimony.Â  The family court\r\n  observed, â€œthere was no testimony as to what type of training may be required\r\n  to enable [Wife] to become successful in the job market.â€Â  Indeed, no evidence\r\n  of an educational program or plan, a timetable, a projected cost of retraining\r\n  Wife, or an estimate of Wifeâ€™s likely earnings exists to support this award.Â  \r\n \r\nGiven\r\n  the lack of specific findings of special circumstances warranting a departure\r\n  from permanent periodic alimony, we find the family court erred in awarding one\r\n  year of rehabilitative alimony.Â  Accordingly, we remand this issue for the\r\n  family court to determine whether special circumstances exist to support its\r\n  award of rehabilitative alimony, or, in the absence of special circumstances,\r\n  to award permanent periodic alimony instead of rehabilitative alimony.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nWife\r\n  argues the family court erred in awarding her an insufficient amount of\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  We agree.Â   \r\nIn a\r\n  family court matter, â€œ[t]he award of attorneyâ€™s fees . . . will only be\r\n  disturbed upon a showing of abuse of discretion.â€Â  Upchurch v. Upchurch,\r\n  367 S.C. 16, 28, 624 S.E.2d 643, 648 (2006).Â  â€œA decision lacking a discernible\r\n  reason is arbitrary and constitutes an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Johnson,\r\n  296 S.C. at 304, 372 S.E.2d at 115.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  family court has jurisdiction to award reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees where a claim\r\n  for attorneyâ€™s fees is well-founded.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-3-120 through -140,\r\n  Â§ 20-7-420(38) (Supp. 2007).Â  The decision whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees is\r\n  within the discretion of the family court.Â  Upchurch, 367 S.C. at 28,\r\n  624 S.E.2d at 648. Â In determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the family\r\n  court should consider each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fees, the\r\n  beneficial results obtained, the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions, and\r\n  the effect of the fee on the partiesâ€™ standards of living. Â E.D.M. v. T.A.M.,\r\n  307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  The reasonableness of an\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fee lies in â€œ(1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2)\r\n  the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) professional standing of counsel;\r\n  (4) contingency of compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained; and (6)\r\n  customary legal fees for similar services.â€Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304\r\n  S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).Â  Other factors to consider in\r\n  awarding attorneyâ€™s fees are â€œthe abilities of the parties to pay, their\r\n  respective financial conditions and the effect of the attorneyâ€™s fees on each\r\n  partyâ€™s standard of living.â€Â  Mitchell v. Mitchell, 283 S.C. 87, 93, 320\r\n  S.E.2d 706, 710 (1984).Â  The factors enunciated by the court, and not the\r\n  amount of any other monies awarded in the suit, determine the appropriate\r\n  amount of an award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Williamson v. Middleton, 374\r\n  S.C. 419, 431, 649 S.E.2d 57, 64 (Ct. App. 2007).\r\nWe\r\n  find Wife is entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees pursuant to the factors of E.D.M.Â \r\n  The family court found Wife had incurred a total of $68,103.46 in attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees and costs, and Husband had incurred $14,853.25 in fees and costs.Â  The\r\n  family court then required Husband to pay $7,500.00 to one of Wifeâ€™s attorneys,\r\n  presumably in addition to the $5,000.00 previously ordered.Â  Although it\r\n  recognized Husbandâ€™s uncooperative behavior during discovery increased the\r\n  difficulty of Wifeâ€™s case, the family court failed to set forth sufficiently\r\n  specific findings to illuminate a discernible reason for requiring Husband to\r\n  pay such a small portion of Wifeâ€™s bill.Â  We are unable to determine why the\r\n  family court awarded Wife only $12,500.00 when her total attorneyâ€™s fees and\r\n  costs exceeded Husbandâ€™s by $53,250.21.Â  We are concerned the order in this\r\n  matter failed to address the impact of this award on either party.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find the family court erred in failing to support its award\r\n  with specific findings that suggest a discernible reason.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  family court did not err in refusing to require Husband to pay all of Wifeâ€™s\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Although Wife argues she should receive full fees, the cases\r\n  to which she cites are distinguishable from the one at bar.Â  In Johnson,\r\n  a mentally and physically abusive husband filed suit to enforce an invalid\r\n  antenuptial agreement.Â  296 S.C. at 292, 372 S.E.2d at 109.Â  Furthermore, he\r\n  refused to answer discovery, filed a grossly misleading financial declaration,\r\n  and contested every issue.Â  Id. at 303-04, 372 S.E.2d at 115.Â  In Taylor v. Taylor, a husband sued his former wife three different times, she\r\n  prevailed each time, and he appealed, only to dismiss his appeal later.Â  333\r\n  S.C. 209, 220, 508 S.E.2d 50, 56 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Unlike his former wife, the\r\n  husband was able to afford lengthy lawsuits and intentionally prolonged and\r\n  complicated each suit.Â  Id., 508 S.E.2d at 56.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  the case at bar, only one lawsuit exists between the parties.Â  Wife filed for separate\r\n  maintenance, and both parties requested and received a divorce on the ground of\r\n  one yearâ€™s continuous separation, the so-called â€œno-faultâ€ ground.Â  The family\r\n  court found it â€œdifficult to determine what actually caused the dissolution of\r\n  the marriage.â€Â  Unlike the hapless wives in Johnson and Taylor,\r\n  Wife initiated this suit, through which both parties obtained relief.Â \r\n  Therefore, an award of full fees to Wife would be inappropriate.Â Â   \r\nConsequently,\r\n  we remand the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees to the family court for an order incorporating specific findings as to the factors expressed in E.D.M., Glasscock,\r\n  and Mitchell and awarding appropriate relief.Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAs\r\n  to the issue of Wifeâ€™s special equity interest in the increased value of\r\n  Husbandâ€™s businesses, we find Wife failed to establish a causal connection\r\n  between her actions and any increase in the value of Husbandâ€™sÂ  businesses.Â \r\n  Therefore, we affirm the family courtâ€™s denial of a special equity interest in\r\n  the increased value of those businesses.\r\nAs\r\n  to the issue of spousal support, we find the family court erred in awarding\r\n  Wife one year of rehabilitative alimony without a showing of special\r\n  circumstances meriting this award.Â  Neither party appealed the family courtâ€™s\r\n  finding that Wife is entitled to alimony.Â  Therefore, we find Wife is entitled\r\n  to permanent periodic alimony, unless a showing is made of special\r\n  circumstances justifying rehabilitative alimony.Â  Accordingly, we remand this\r\n  issue to the family court for further proceedings in accordance with this\r\n  opinion.Â Â Â   \r\nFinally,\r\n  as to the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees, we find the family court erred in failing\r\n  to support its award with sufficiently specific findings to explain its\r\n  decision.Â  We also find Wife was not entitled to an award of full attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees.Â  Therefore, we remand the issue of\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees to the family court for\r\n  an order incorporating specific findings in accordance with this opinion and awarding appropriate relief.Â  \r\n \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the order of the family court is  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART AND REMANDED.Â   \r\nANDERSON, SHORT,\r\n  and THOMAS JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] From 1998 to 2002, the approximate term of the\r\n  marriage, the funeral homeâ€™s gross sales increased from about $380,000 to about\r\n  $624,000, an increase of about $244,000.Â  During that same time\r\n  period, the cemeteryâ€™s gross sales increased from $36,942 to about $135,000, an\r\n  increase of about $98,058.\r\n[3] One\r\n  separation occurred when Wife insisted Husband leave the house because he had\r\n  been drinking.Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-199","title":"Brayboy v.

Â During the application process, Brayboy also signed the\r\n  following statement:\r\n\r\n\tIf I do not give accurate and truthful information in this\r\n  Medical History Questionnaire, which forms the second and final part of my\r\n  employment agreement, the entire employment shall be considered null and void. \r\n\t\r\n\tMISREPRESENTATIONS AS TO PREEXISTING PHYSICAL OR MENTAL\r\n  CONDITIONS MAY CAUSE FORFEITURE OF YOUR WORKERSâ€™ COMPENSATION BENEFITS.\r\n\r\nOn April 18, 2003, while at work, Brayboy was injured while pulling\r\n  up a chain-link fence. Â Brayboy believed he had pulled a major muscle in his\r\n  lower back.Â  After informing his supervisor, Brayboy sought medical treatment.Â \r\n  As a result of this accident, Brayboy has impaired mobility and walks with a\r\n  crutch.Â  He experiences pain in his legs and lower back, and he takes medication\r\n  for the pain.\r\nBrayboy notified his employer and timely filed a workersâ€™\r\n  compensation claim.Â  Brayboyâ€™s misrepresentations in his job application became\r\n  the basis for WorkForceâ€™s denial of his entitlement to compensation.Â \r\n  Specifically, WorkForce argued Brayboyâ€™s misleading answers in its pre-employment\r\n  questionnaire vitiated the partiesâ€™ employment relationship and\r\n  precluded Brayboy from receiving benefits under the Act.Â  The single commissioner\r\n  presided over a hearing and concluded Brayboy was a WorkForce employee when he\r\n  sustained his back injury.Â  WorkForce appealed the single commissionerâ€™s\r\n  findings to the Appellate Panel which affirmed the order of the single commissioner.Â Â \r\n  Thereafter, WorkForce appealed the order of the Appellate Panel to the circuit\r\n  court, which affirmed the Appellate Panelâ€™s order.Â  This appeal followed.Â \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  employee relationship is a jurisdictional issue for the purposes of workersâ€™\r\n  compensation benefits and thus, our review is governed by the preponderance of\r\n  the evidence standard.â€Â  Vines v. Champion Bldg. Products, 315 S.C. 13,\r\n  16, 431 S.E.2d 585, 586&nbsp;(1993).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe\r\n  sole issue presented on appeal is whether the circuit court erred as a matter\r\n  of law in summarily concluding Brayboy was a WorkForce employee. For the\r\n  reasons set forth below, we find Brayboyâ€™s misrepresentations vitiated the partiesâ€™ employment relationship and precluded Brayboy from\r\n  receiving benefits under the Act.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we reverse.\r\nIn Cooper v. McDevitt\r\n  &amp; Street Co., 260 S.C. 463, 468,\r\n  196 S.E.2d 833, 835 (1973), the Supreme Court of South Carolina adopted a three-part\r\n  test for determining when a\r\n  false statement in an employment application will bar benefits. Â This test, as explained in Givens v. Steel Structures, Inc., provides the employment relationship will:\r\n\r\n\tbe vitiated where false statements were made on a job application\r\n  in the presence of three factors: (1) knowing and wilful nature of the false\r\n  representation as to physical condition;\r\n  (2) reliance by the employer upon the false representation as a substantial\r\n  factor in the hiring; (3) causal connection between the false\r\n  representation and the injury.Â  \r\n\r\n279\r\n  S.C. 12, 13-14, 301 S.E.2d 545, 546-7&nbsp;(1983).Â  We note the test in Cooper is an â€œandâ€ test, meaning an employer must prove all three of its factors\r\n  before an employee is barred from receiving workersâ€™ compensation benefits.Â \r\n  Therefore, if an employer fails to prove any of these factors, a claimant will\r\n  still be considered an employee under the Act. Â See Vines, 315\r\n  S.C. at 16, 431 S.E.2d at 586 (â€œAll factors must be present for the employer to\r\n  avoid paying benefits.â€).Â   \r\n1)&nbsp; Knowing and Willful False Representation\r\n    of a Physical Condition\r\nUnder the first\r\n  prong of Cooper, not only must an employee have made a misrepresentation\r\n  of a physical condition on an employment application, this falsity must be\r\n  known and the misrepresentation must have been willfully made.Â   \r\nUndoubtedly, Brayboy\r\n  made numerous misrepresentations on his employment application.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Brayboy checked â€œnoâ€ in the section of the application questioning whether he\r\n  had ever been treated for foot injuries, spinal injuries, or backaches.Â \r\n  Additionally, Brayboy indicated he had not experienced â€œ[o]ne or more back\r\n  injuries or a disease process of the back resulting in a disability.â€Â  Brayboy\r\n  also denied ever filing a workersâ€™ compensation claim.Â  However, the record\r\n  shows Brayboy had experienced an injury while working for the Navy, for which\r\n  he has received thirty years of benefits.Â  Brayboy was also involved in a\r\n  work-related accident while employed with McCrory.Â  As a result of this\r\n  accident, he sought recovery under the Act and received a settlement of approximately $8,500 to $8,700 and a five percent impairment\r\n  rating for both his back and his ankle.Â   \r\nGiven the record\r\n  before us, we are convinced that Brayboy knew the falsity of his statements and\r\n  willfully made the misrepresentations. Â Â \r\n2.&nbsp; Employerâ€™s Reliance Upon the False Representation as a\r\n  Substantial Factor in Hiring\r\nUnder\r\n  the second prong of Cooper, WorkForce bears the burden of proving it\r\n  relied on Brayboyâ€™s misrepresentations in its decision to hire him.Â  Â Â \r\nBrian Ingles, a\r\n  sales manager for WorkForce, testified WorkForce requires new applicants to\r\n  fill out employment and medical history questionnaires to protect the applicant\r\n  and the company.Â  Ingles stated WorkForce tries not to put workers in\r\n  potentially harmful situations by carefully taking into consideration an applicantâ€™s\r\n  previous injuries.Â Â  Additionally, Ingles claimed information provided by an\r\n  applicant regarding a previous injury would be a substantial factor in the\r\n  hiring process.Â  Ingles also testified Brayboy was hired as a trim carpenter,\r\n  and â€œthe job he was hired on really [wasnâ€™t] that physically demanding in\r\n  nature.â€Â  Finally, Ingles admitted there was a possibility Brayboy would have\r\n  been eligible to work as a trim carpenter had he honestly filled out the employment\r\n  application.Â   \r\nChristopher Lee,\r\n  a previous WorkForce employee, testified he had reviewed Brayboyâ€™s employment\r\n  application and medical history questionnaire.Â  Lee stated he had relied upon\r\n  Brayboyâ€™s statements in deciding to hire Brayboy and claimed the\r\n  representations were a substantial factor in his hiring decision.Â  Lee\r\n  testified WorkForce uses the questionnaires: â€œTo protect us as employers and to\r\n  protect the person going to work, both, so that we know what a person is\r\n  capable of doing, so we donâ€™t put them into a situation where they could hurt\r\n  themselves.â€Â Â  Â Lee also stated he would have taken into account Brayboyâ€™s\r\n  prior injuries in determining what type of work to give Brayboy.Â  When asked\r\n  whether knowledge of Brayboyâ€™s previous injuries would have prevented him from\r\n  hiring Brayboy, Lee stated: â€œIt wouldnâ€™t prevent me from hiring him.Â  It would\r\n  just lead to further analysis or lead to possibly finding something that was\r\n  more suited to his capabilities.â€Â   \r\nGiven the\r\n  testimony of these two witnesses, we are convinced that, although it may have\r\n  still hired Brayboy even if it knew of his previous injuries, Workforce relied\r\n  on his false representations in assigning his job duties. Therefore, the second\r\n  prong of Cooper is satisfied.Â  SeeÂ  Jones v. Georgia-Pacific\r\n    Corp., 355 S.C. 413, 418-19, 586 S.E.2d 111,114&nbsp;(2003) (holding the\r\n  second prong of Cooper was satisfied where â€œRespondentâ€™s Human Resource Managerâ€¦\r\n  testified that the fact that Claimant had prior physical ailments would not\r\n  have barred her from working for Respondent. Rather, Respondent would have attempted to find a job for Claimant that would not subject a pre-existing physical\r\n  impairment to further deterioration.â€).Â   \r\n3.&nbsp; Causal Connection Between the False Representation and the Injury\r\nUnder the third\r\n  prong of Cooper, WorkForce must prove a causal connection existed between\r\n  Brayboyâ€™s false representations and the injury sustained.  \r\nWorkForce\r\n  argues the issue of a causal connection is undisputed because the Appellate\r\n  Panel found, â€œ[Brayboy] had a longstanding lower back pain, which was exacerbated\r\n  after his injury.â€ Â However, the employee relationship is a jurisdictional issue.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we must conduct our own review of the record.  \r\nBrayboy\r\n  sought and received an increase in his Department of Veterans Affairs\r\n  impairment rating from twenty percent to forty percent due to â€œan injury on\r\n  April 18, 2003 that further aggravated [his] serviceâ€ injury.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  Brayboyâ€™s patientâ€™s progress notes from the Department of Veterans Affairs state\r\n  that he suffered from â€œlongstandingâ€ lower back pain which was â€œexacerbated\r\n  after an injury.â€Â  Given this evidence, we find a causal connection has been\r\n  established, satisfying the third prong of Cooper. Â See Givens\r\n    v. Steel Structures, Inc., 279 S.C. 12, 14, 301 S.E.2d 545, 547&nbsp;(1983)\r\n  (â€œExpert medical testimony clearly indicated that claimantâ€™s condition was oneâ€¦\r\n  reflecting the cumulative effect of successive injuries. The only reasonable\r\n  inference to be drawn from th[e] record was that a causal connection had been\r\n  established sufficient for the purposes of Cooper.â€).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, we find WorkForce has proven all three prongs of the Cooper test.Â  Accordingly, the order of the trial court is \r\n \r\nREVERSED.\r\nANDERSON, SHORT,\r\n  and WILLIAMS JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-200","title":"City of Newberry v.

(the Cooperative) could\r\n  lawfully provide electric service to a store located in an area annexed by the\r\n  City.Â  We affirm.  \r\nFACTS\r\nThis\r\n  case involves the Cityâ€™s annexation of 25.7 acres of land within the service\r\n  territory of the Cooperative, as assigned by the Public Service Commission (the\r\n  Commission).Â  In early 1999, the City and the Cooperative learned Wal-Mart Stores East, LP and Wal-Mart Real\r\n  Estate Business Trust (collectively Wal-Mart) intended to construct and operate a new store on the 25.7 acres. Â At\r\n  the time, Interlink Development, Ltd. (Interlink) owned the property.Â  Both\r\n  the City and the Cooperative desired to provide electric service for the\r\n  store.Â  Wal-Mart, believing either could serve the tract, solicited proposals from\r\n  both parties.Â Â Â Â   \r\nSubsequently,\r\n  the Cooperative filed a complaint with the Commission seeking an order\r\n  prohibiting the City from annexing or serving electricity to Wal-Mart.Â  The\r\n  Cooperative also filed a Rule to Show Cause, asking the City to establish why\r\n  it should not be permanently restrained from interfering with the Cooperativeâ€™s\r\n  electric service to Wal-Mart.Â  Along with the original complaint, the\r\n  Cooperative filed a motion for an immediate temporary restraining order.Â  Subsequently,\r\n  the Cooperative filed a supplemental complaint with the Commission seeking an\r\n  order prohibiting the City from attempting to construct or provide service to\r\n  Wal-Mart.Â Â   \r\nOn\r\n  June 11, 1999, the Commission ordered the City to cease and desist its attempts\r\n  to provide electric service to Wal-Mart in the Cooperativeâ€™s assigned territory.Â \r\n  The order also required the City to appear and show cause why it should not be\r\n  permanently restrained from interfering with the Cooperativeâ€™s electric service\r\n  to Wal-Mart, and a hearing was scheduled in the matter.Â  The order did not prohibit\r\n  the City from annexing the property because the Commission lacked the necessary\r\n  jurisdiction to do so.Â Â   \r\nA\r\n  few days after the Commission issued the cease and desist order, the\r\n  Cooperative filed a complaint with the circuit court.Â  In the complaint, the\r\n  Cooperative sought an order: (1) prohibiting the City from annexing the\r\n  property; (2) prohibiting the City from attempting to provide electrical\r\n  services to Wal-Mart; and (3) prohibiting the City from requiring Wal-Mart to\r\n  purchase electrical service as a condition for receiving other services.Â  The Cooperative\r\n  also filed a motion in the circuit court seeking a temporary restraining\r\n  order.Â Â   \r\nIn\r\n  considering whether to choose the City or the Cooperative as its service\r\n  provider, Wal-Mart initially concluded it should accept the Cityâ€™s proposal. Â Wal-Mart believed it would not be able to receive the other services\r\n  offered by the City if it accepted the Cooperativeâ€™s proposal. Â In an\r\n  affidavit, the Cityâ€™s Utility Director stated the Cityâ€™s proposal â€œdid not\r\n  require Wal-Mart to accept electric service as a condition to the receipt of\r\n  other services.â€ Â With the Commissionâ€™s cease and desist order in place,\r\n  Wal-Mart accepted the Cooperativeâ€™s proposal for electric service, preferring the\r\n  Cooperativeâ€™s â€œcheaper rates.â€Â  \r\nOn\r\n  June 21, 1999, the Cooperative and Wal-Mart entered into two contracts: a\r\n  distribution agreement and an agreement for electric power service.Â  One\r\n  week later, the parties agreed to dismiss the Cooperativeâ€™s action in the\r\n  circuit court.Â  Additionally, by letter, the Cooperative informed the Commission\r\n  the parties had agreed to dismiss the action before it.Â  The letter included a\r\n  proposed order of dismissal signed by the attorneys for both parties.Â  The\r\n  proposed order stated the issue had â€œbeen resolvedâ€ and the matter was â€œmootâ€\r\n  because Wal-Mart signed an agreement to purchase electricity from the\r\n  Cooperative. Â Ultimately, the Commission issued an order dismissing the\r\n  action using the language from the proposed order.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  City annexed the property by ordinance on July 27, 1999.Â  Before the date of\r\n  annexation, the Cooperative had already commenced the work necessary to provide\r\n  electricity to Wal-Mart.Â  This included clearing the land and relocating electric\r\n  poles and power lines.Â  By January of 2000, the Cooperative was providing power\r\n  to a contractor for the construction of the store; however, the Cooperative was\r\n  not providing electricity to any building, structure, or facility.Â  On\r\n  June 12, 2000, the Cooperative began to supply service to the completed Wal-Mart\r\n  store.  \r\nOn\r\n  June 2, 2003, the City brought this action against the Cooperative.Â  In its\r\n  complaint, the City sought:Â  (1) a declaratory judgment that the Cooperative\r\n  did not have the authority to serve the Wal-Mart store; (2) an injunction\r\n  prohibiting the Cooperative from further providing electric service to the\r\n  store; and (3) damages.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  Cooperative answered, asserting inter alia, (1) the Cityâ€™s claim\r\n  was barred by the statute of limitations and the doctrines of waiver, laches,\r\n  and estoppel, and (2) it was entitled to a declaratory judgment that it had the\r\n  authority to serve electricity to Wal-Mart.Â  In addition, the Cooperative\r\n  asserted any interpretation of the applicable statutes which would impair its\r\n  obligations under the service contracts would be unconstitutional.Â  Subsequently,\r\n  Wal-Mart submitted a motion to intervene as defendants in the action pursuant\r\n  to Rule 24, SCRCP, and the City and Cooperative consented to intervention.\r\nAfter\r\n  a hearing, the circuit court found the City was barred form bringing its claims\r\n  by (1) the statute of limitations; (2) the doctrine of waiver; and (3) the\r\n  related doctrines of laches, estoppel, and judicial estoppel.Â  The circuit\r\n  court also held the Cooperative was entitled to prevail on the merits of its counterclaim\r\n  for declaratory judgment.Â  This appeal followed.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œA\r\n  suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined\r\n  by the nature of the underlying issue.â€Â  Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991).Â \r\n  â€œAn issue, essentially one at law, will not be transformed into one in equity\r\n  simply because declaratory relief is sought.â€Â  Id. Â â€œ[T]he character, as legal or equitable, of an action is\r\n  determined by the complaint in its main purpose, the nature of the issues as\r\n  raised by the pleadings or the pleadings and proof, and the character of the\r\n  relief sought under them.â€Â  Clark v. Hargrave,\r\n  323 S.C. 84, 86, 473 S.E.2d 474, 476&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996) (citing Ins.\r\n    Fin. Serv., Inc. v. S. C. Ins. Co., 271 S.C. 289, 247 S.E.2d 315 (1978)). Â â€œAn issue\r\n  regarding statutory interpretation is a question of law.â€Â  Univ. of S. Cal. v. Moran, 365 S.C. 270, 274, 617 S.E.2d 135, 137&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 2005).Â  â€œWhen reviewing an action at law, on appeal of a case tried\r\n  without a jury, the appellate courtâ€™s jurisdiction is limited to correction of\r\n  errors at law.â€Â  Epworth Childrenâ€™s Home v. Beasley,&nbsp;365 S.C. 157,\r\n  164, 616 S.E.2d 710, 714&nbsp;(2005).Â  â€œThe appellate court will not disturb\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s findings of fact as long as they are reasonably supported\r\n  by the evidence.â€Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe\r\n  City argues the Cooperative is not authorized to serve Wal-Mart under the Rural\r\n  Electric Cooperative Act (RECA).Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  Legislature enacted the RECA to promote and extend electric energy in rural\r\n  areas.Â  City of Newberry v. Newberry\r\n    Elec. Co-op.,&nbsp;352 S.C. 570, 573,\r\n  575 S.E.2d 83, 85&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003) (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-49-210 (1990)). â€œRural\r\n  electric cooperatives are creatures of statute and only have such authority as\r\n  the [L]egislature has given them.â€Â  Duke Power Co. v. Laurens Elec. Co-op, 344 S.C. 101, 104, 543 S.E.2d 560, 562 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  As a general rule, a\r\n  cooperative is prohibited from serving in nonrural areas because â€œ[t]he RECA grants\r\n  cooperatives the authority to supply electric energy only in rural areas, i.e., areas with populations less than 2,500 persons.â€Â  City\r\n    of Newberry, 352 S.C. at 573, 575 S.E.2d at 85 (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-49-250(1) (1990)).Â  To â€œprevent the ouster of co-ops from areas they have\r\n  historically served due to population growth or annexation,â€ the legislature\r\n  provided exceptions to the general prohibition on cooperative service in\r\n  nonrural areas. Â Duke Power, 344 S.C. at 105, 543 S.E.2d at 562.Â Â \r\n  At issue in this case is the â€œannexation exception,â€ which states in pertinent\r\n  part:\r\n\r\n\tthe act of incorporating or annexing into a city or town an area in which the\r\n  cooperative is serving constitutes the consent of the governing body of such\r\n  city or town for the cooperative to continue serving all premises then being\r\n  served by the cooperative and such cooperative is empowered to so serve.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. 33-49-250(1)\r\n  (2006).[1]  \r\nThe\r\n  plain language of section 33-49-250(1) provides the annexation exception\r\n  applies upon a cityâ€™s â€œact of incorporating or annexing into a city or town an\r\n  area in which the cooperative is serving.â€ Â Our prior interpretations of the\r\n  exception indicate a cooperative must be serving within the area at the time of\r\n  annexation for the exception to apply.Â  See City of Newberry, 352\r\n  S.C. at 576, 575 S.E.2d at 86; Duke Power, 344 S.C. at 106, 543 S.E.2d\r\n  at 563.  \r\nIf a\r\n  cooperative is serving an area at the time of annexation, the annexation\r\n  implies the consent of a municipality for the cooperative to â€œcontinue serving\r\n  all premises then being served.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. 33-49-250(1).Â  To this end, we\r\n  have held â€œif a cooperative is serving existing customers, it has a\r\n  statutory right to continue serving themâ€ after annexation. City of Newberry,\r\n  352 S.C. at 576, 575 S.E.2d at 86 (emphasis in original). Â Further, â€œthe annexation exception also implies consent for\r\n  cooperatives to serve â€˜additional premises,â€™ i.e., new customers, within an\r\n  annexed area.â€ Id. (quoting S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 33-49-250(1)).Â  However, â€œthe statute expressly limits a\r\n  cooperativeâ€™s authority to provide new or increased service by allowing it only\r\n  â€˜until such time as the governing body of the city or town shall direct\r\n  otherwise. . . .â€™â€ Id.  \r\nIn\r\n  the present case, the parties dispute whether the Cooperative was serving the\r\n  area prior to annexation.Â  The City argues the annexation exception does not\r\n  apply because the Cooperative was not providing electricity to a premises on\r\n  the date of annexation, July 27, 1999.Â  The circuit court held the Cooperative\r\n  was serving the premises because of the contract in place between the two\r\n  parties. Â In reaching this conclusion, the circuit court applied the definition\r\n  of â€œpremisesâ€ from the Territorial Assignment Act found in section 58-27-610 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (1977).Â  The pertinent part of the section defines\r\n  â€œpremisesâ€ as a â€œbuilding, structure or facility to which electricity is being\r\n  or is to be furnished.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-27-610 (2) (emphasis added).Â \r\n  The circuit court found the definitionâ€™s inclusion of buildings, structures, or\r\n  facilities â€œto be furnishedâ€ supported its conclusion the statutory scheme contemplated\r\n  a situation where a cooperative has a contract, but the customer has not yet\r\n  erected a structure to which service can be provided.\r\nWe\r\n  are inclined to point out that while section 58-27-610(2) includes premises â€œto\r\n  be served,â€ the language of section 33-49-250(1) only refers to premises â€œthen\r\n  being served.â€ Â A plain and ordinary interpretation of such language mandates that\r\n  a cooperative must be serving a premises at the time of annexation.Â  Therefore,\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s reliance on the words â€œto be furnished,â€ is misplaced.Â  \r\n \r\nSubsequent\r\n  to the circuit courtâ€™s order, the supreme court addressed the issue of what\r\n  constitutes a â€œpremises then being servedâ€ under section 33-49-250(1). Â In City\r\n    of Camden v. Fairfield Elec. Co-op., Inc., 372 S.C. 543, 643 S.E.2d 687\r\n  (2007), the supreme court affirmed the application of the definition of\r\n  â€œpremisesâ€ from section 58-27-610(2) to the annexation exception. Id. at 547, 643 S.E.2d at 689.Â  However, the Camden court affirmed a finding\r\n  that a rural cooperative did not have authority to serve an annexed property,\r\n  even though the customer had selected the cooperative as their future service\r\n  provider prior to annexation. Â Id. Â In its analysis, the court did not\r\n  address the effect of the customerâ€™s selection, and instead upheld the decision\r\n  of the trial court because a security light placed on an unimproved lot â€œdid\r\n  not constitute a â€˜building, structure, or facilityâ€™ to which electricity was\r\n  being furnished, such that it was not a â€˜premises then being servedâ€™â€ under section\r\n  33-49-250(1).Â  Id. at 547-48, 643 S.E.2d at 689.Â  Furthermore, the supreme\r\n  court noted â€œthe statute merely requires the coop[erative] to be serving a\r\n  building, structure or facility at the time of annexation.â€Â  Id. at 549,\r\n  643 S.E.2d at 690.\r\nCamden is not controlling in this case for two reasons.Â \r\n  First, the property in Camden was located in an unassigned area, while the\r\n  property in question in this case was specifically assigned to the Cooperative\r\n  prior to annexation.Â  Second, instead of a mere customer selection of its\r\n  future service provider, the Cooperative and Wal-Mart entered into valid and\r\n  binding service contracts.Â Â Â   \r\nIn Camden, the only possible action which could be considered service to the premises\r\n  prior to annexation was the construction of the security light on its existing\r\n  lines. While the customer â€œselectedâ€ the cooperative as its power provider, the\r\n  parties were not bound by the selection because there was no contract between\r\n  them.Â  The customer was free to change its mind and select a different power\r\n  provider because the area had not been assigned.Â   \r\nWe\r\n  need not reach the issue of whether the cooperative was providing service to a\r\n  premises at the time of the annexation since we conclude section 58-27-670(1)\r\n  precludes the City from interfering with an existing contract for services.Â  As\r\n  indicated, the parties in the present action had entered into a valid and\r\n  binding contract prior to annexation.Â  This contract established the rights and\r\n  responsibilities of the parties, which the parties could not disrupt without\r\n  breaching the contract.Â  Furthermore, prior to annexation, the Cooperative\r\n  acted pursuant to these established rights and responsibilities by commencing\r\n  the work necessary to provide electricity to a building, structure, or facility\r\n  in the future.Â  Lastly, because the\r\n  present case involves annexation of an area which had been assigned to the\r\n  Cooperative under the Territorial Assignments Act, section 58-27-670(1) of the\r\n  South Carolina Code applies.Â  While section 58-27-670(1) expressly states it is\r\n  subject to the provisions of 33-49-250, it also provides:\r\n\r\n\tAnnexation\r\n  may not be construed to increase, decrease, or affect any other right or\r\n  responsibility a municipality, electric cooperative, or electrical utility may\r\n  have with regard to supplying electric\r\n  service in areas assigned by the Public Service Commission in accordance with\r\n  Chapter 27 of Title 58.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-27-670(1)\r\n  (supp. 2007).\r\nIn light of the language of section 58-27-670, we affirm\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s finding that the Cooperative may continue to serve the\r\n  Wal-Mart premises because (1) the Cooperative had contractual rights and\r\n  responsibilities to serve the building, structure, or facility, and (2) the\r\n  Cooperative was performing pursuant to those rights and responsibilities.[2]\r\nThe circuit court\r\n  also addressed the Cooperativeâ€™s defenses which additionally support the\r\n  decision of the trial court.Â  The City of\r\n  Newberry first argues the circuit court erred in applying the three year\r\n  statute of limitations provision of section 15-3-530 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (2005).Â  We disagree.\r\nAs a\r\n  threshold argument, the City contends the language of section 15-3-530 does not\r\n  apply to its cause of action; instead, the City contends the circuit court\r\n  should have relied upon the ten-year statute of limitations provision found in section\r\n  15-3-600 (2005).[3]Â \r\n  Specifically, the City argues the language of section 15-3-530 is general and\r\n  does not specifically address the nature of its action or the underlying basis\r\n  of its claims.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nSection\r\n  15-3-530 applies to â€œan action upon a liability created by statute other than a\r\n  penalty or forfeiture.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(2) (2005).Â  The language of\r\n  section 15-3-530 simply means an action is based upon a liability created by\r\n  statute if the asserted right is one which would not exist but for the\r\n  existence of a statute. See 51 Am. Jur. 2d Limitations of Actions Â§ 127 (2007). Â â€œIn other words, an action is not based upon a liability\r\n  created by statute if the right is one that would exist at common law in the\r\n  absence of statute.â€Â  Id.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  Cityâ€™s claims focus upon whether the Cooperative has the authority to serve\r\n  Wal-Mart under the statutory scheme.Â  The current action would not exist\r\n  without the statutes; accordingly, the litigation is an action upon a liability\r\n  created by statute.Â  Therefore, we affirm the circuit courtâ€™s application of section\r\n  15-3-530 to the Cityâ€™s actions.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  addition to its assertion that section 15-3-530 does not apply, the City argues\r\n  the circuit court erred in holding the statutory period under section 15-3-530\r\n  commenced in 1999, when the City annexed the property.Â  The City contends the\r\n  statute of limitations began to run in 2000, when the Cooperative first\r\n  furnished electricity to Wal-Mart.Â  We disagree.Â  Â \r\nThe\r\n  discovery rule applies to causes of action arising under section\r\n  15-3-530.Â  Rumpf v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 386, 394, 593 S.E.2d\r\n  183, 187&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œUnder the discovery rule, the statute of limitations\r\n  begins to run from the date the injured party either knows or should know, by\r\n  the exercise of reasonable diligence, that a cause of action exists for the\r\n  wrongful conduct.â€Â  Epstein v. Brown,&nbsp;363 S.C. 372, 376, 610 S.E.2d\r\n  816, 818&nbsp;(2005).Â  The injured party must commence the action within three\r\n  years of the time â€œfacts and circumstances of the injury would put a person of\r\n  common knowledge and experience on notice that some right of his had been\r\n  invaded or that some claim against another party might exist.â€ Â Johnston v. Bowen,&nbsp;313 S.C. 61, 64, 437 S.E.2d 45, 47&nbsp;(1993).Â  \r\n \r\nThe\r\n  City argues the statutory period did not commence until June 12, 2000, when the\r\n  Cooperative first began furnishing power to Wal-Mart.Â  The City bases this\r\n  argument on its position the Cooperativeâ€™s service was illegal, and this\r\n  service did not occur until it physically supplied electricity.Â  Even if we\r\n  agreed with the Cityâ€™s position, we note the City could have brought its claims\r\n  immediately following annexation in 1999, because this is the date by which the\r\n  City contends it obtained the right to serve Wal-Mart.Â  When the City annexed\r\n  the property, the City was aware of the service contracts between the\r\n  Cooperative and Wal-Mart, and also was aware that the parties fully intended to\r\n  follow through with those contracts.Â  The City was part of litigation between\r\n  all parties regarding the issue of service which further evidences notice to\r\n  the City.Â  Therefore, we find evidence in the record supports the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s conclusion the City knew or should have known it could pursue a cause\r\n  of action when it annexed the property in 1999, and that the action was barred\r\n  by the applicable statute of limitations.\r\nIn\r\n  deciding this case, the circuit court also addressed the defenses of waiver,\r\n  laches, and estoppel.Â  While the courtâ€™s analysis on these other defenses is\r\n  thorough and well-reasoned, in light of our disposition herein, we need not\r\n  address these issues on appeal.

Wise, 359 S.C. 14, 21, 596 S.E.2d 475,\r\n  478 (2004).Â  Further, a witnessâ€™s\r\n  qualification as an expert and whether to admit or exclude the expertâ€™s\r\n  testimony are issues largely left to the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s discretion.Â  State v. McFadden, 318 S.C. 404, 411, 458\r\n  S.E.2d 61, 65 (Ct.

(Dove Data) brought suit against Jamie DeVeaux (DeVeaux), a\r\n  former employee, alleging eight causes of action: (1) breach of contract; (2)\r\n  breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (3)\r\n  misappropriation of trade secrets; (4) intentional interference with\r\n  contractual relations; (5) intentional interference with prospective\r\n  contractual relations; (6) breach of the employee duty of loyalty; (7)\r\n  violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA); and (8)\r\n  equitable relief.Â  Dove Data appeals the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary\r\n  judgment in favor of DeVeaux on all eight causes.Â  Dove Data additionally\r\n  appeals the trial courtâ€™s grant of DeVeauxâ€™s motion to dissolve preliminary\r\n  injunction.Â  We affirm.Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nDove Data is engaged in the business of\r\n  the manufacture, re-manufacture, and sale of computer printer, facsimile\r\n  machine, and copier supplies.Â  For approximately nine and one-half years,\r\n  DeVeaux was employed with Dove Data as a marketing representative and account\r\n  manager.[1]Â  Â Â During DeVeauxâ€™s employment, he sold toner cartridges and related\r\n  products to customers in the Charleston, Myrtle Beach, and Savannah areas.\r\n \r\nDeVeaux began working for Dove Data in August 1995.Â  Thirteen\r\n  months later, Dove Data presented DeVeaux with an â€œEmployee Non-Compete\r\n  Agreementâ€ and â€œEmployee Non-Disclosure Agreement.â€ Â Â The Employee\r\n  Non-Compete Agreement included a non-compete covenant, one year in duration and\r\n  completely unrestricted as to geographic scope. Â Â \r\nOn January 31, 2001, over five years after the inception of\r\n  DeVeauxâ€™s employment, Dove Data presented DeVeaux with a new employment\r\n  agreement (Employment Agreement).Â  DeVeaux signed the Employment\r\n  Agreement, which contained a covenant not to compete and a covenant not to\r\n  disclose. Â Â The covenant not to compete provided:  \r\n\r\n\t(a) [DeVeaux] covenants that he will not at any time during his\r\n  employment by [Dove Data] or within a period of two (2) years after the\r\n  termination of his employment with or without cause:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(1) . . . within [DeVeauxâ€™s] territory,\r\n  engage in the business of selling, soliciting or taking orders for computer\r\n  printer, facsimile machine, and copier supplies, including toner and ink\r\n  products, in competition with the business of [Dove Data].\r\n\t\t(2) . . . within [DeVeauxâ€™s] territory or\r\n  any other area assigned to him during any part of the two (2)-year period\r\n  immediately preceding the termination of his employment, sell, solicit, or take\r\n  orders for computer printer, facsimile machine, and copier supplies, including\r\n  toner and ink products, from any person or entity who or which shall have been\r\n  a customer or account of [Dove Dataâ€™s] during any part of the two (2)-year\r\n  period immediately preceding the termination of his employment or who or which\r\n  was actively solicited as a customer or account by [Dove Data] during the two\r\n  (2)-year period immediately preceding the termination of his employment.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t(3) . . . within [DeVeauxâ€™s] territory,\r\n  solicit, divert, take away, or interfere with or attempt to solicit, divert,\r\n  take away, or interfere with any of the custom, trade, business or patronage of\r\n  [Dove Data] or in any manner, directly or indirectly, hire, employ, or\r\n  interfere with any person who shall be employed by [Dove Data]. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe Employment Agreement indicated that\r\n  continued employment, which included continued access to certain information,\r\n  was the consideration provided DeVeaux in exchange for entering the Employment\r\n  Agreement:  \r\n\r\n\t[Dove Data] hereby agrees to continue the employment of [DeVeaux]\r\n  as a salesman.Â  [DeVeaux] hereby agrees to continue in such employment.Â \r\n  [DeVeaux] has been and will be furnished with certain data reflecting the names\r\n  and addresses of present and prospective customers or accounts of [Dove Data]\r\n  and [Dove Data]â€™s methods of selling and delivering products to said customers\r\n  or accounts.Â  [DeVeaux] recognizes and acknowledges that the above-described\r\n  data is confidential information constituting a business secret and/or a trade\r\n  secret of [Dove Data].\r\n\r\nOn October 14, 2004, DeVeaux filed\r\n  articles of incorporation for a new company, Southpoint Products, Inc.\r\n  (Southpoint).Â  Â On the evening of January 23, 2005, DeVeaux faxed a resignation\r\n  letter, dated January 24, 2005, to Dove Data, which read: â€œplease consider this\r\n  letter as my resignation from Dove Data Products as of 10 am today.â€Â  On the\r\n  afternoon of January 24, 2005, DeVeaux began to compete with Dove Data.Â Â Â Â \r\n \r\nDove\r\n  Data filed this action alleging eight causes of action and seeking a\r\n  preliminary injunction against DeVeaux.Â  The trial court granted Dove Dataâ€™s\r\n  motion for preliminary injunction.Â  Under the preliminary injunction, DeVeaux\r\n  maintained the right to compete with Dove Data but was temporarily prohibited\r\n  from soliciting or doing business with certain customers identified on an\r\n  attached list.Â  The injunction and attached list of customers were filed\r\n  with the court. Â \r\nOn\r\n  October 10, 2005, Dove Data filed a motion to hold DeVeaux in contempt, based\r\n  on allegations that he had given a copy of the preliminary injunction order to\r\n  two of Dove Dataâ€™s competitors.Â  This motion was set for a hearing on two\r\n  occasions, but was continued on Dove Dataâ€™s request both times.Â  On May 3,\r\n  2006, DeVeaux filed a motion for summary judgment and motion to dissolve the\r\n  preliminary injunction.Â  A hearing was set for May 22, 2006, on all\r\n  pending motions.Â  At the hearing, both parties indicated they wished to go\r\n  forward on DeVeauxâ€™s motion for summary judgment and in the event summary\r\n  judgment was not granted, Dove Data indicated it would request a third\r\n  continuance of the motion for contempt.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   \r\nThe trial court granted summary judgment\r\n  to DeVeaux on all eight causes, dissolved the preliminary injunction, and\r\n  denied the motion for contempt as moot in light of the fact that there was no\r\n  legal basis for the injunction.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA trial court\r\n  should grant a motion for summary judgment when â€œthe pleadings, depositions,\r\n  answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the\r\n  affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\r\n  and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule\r\n    56(c), SCRCP; Wells v. City of Lynchburg, 331 S.C. 296, 301, 501\r\n  S.E.2d 746, 749 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  When reviewing a grant of a summary judgment\r\n  motion, this court applies the same standard of review as the trial court.Â  Helms\r\n    Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 340, 611 S.E.2d 485, 488\r\n  (2005).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the reviewing\r\n  court must consider all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and\r\n  from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Willis\r\n    v. Wu, 362 S.C. 146, 151, 607 S.E.2d 63, 65 (2004).Â   \r\nSummary\r\n  judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is\r\n  desirable to clarify the application of the law.Â  Gadson v. Hembree, 364\r\n  S.C. 316, 320, 613 S.E.2d 533, 535 (2005).Â  Even when there is no dispute as to\r\n  evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn\r\n  from them, summary judgment should be denied.Â  Nelson v. Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n, 362 S.C. 1, 5, 605 S.E.2d 744, 746 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004).Â  However, â€œwhen plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which\r\n  reasonable minds cannot differ, summary judgment should be granted.â€Â  Ellis\r\n    v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 518, 595 S.E.2d 817, 822 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\n \r\nThe\r\n  moving party has the initial responsibility of demonstrating the absence of a\r\n  genuine issue of material fact.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Once the moving\r\n  party carries its initial burden, the non-moving party must â€œdo more than\r\n  simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material factsâ€ but\r\n  â€œmust come forward with â€˜specific facts showing that there is a genuine\r\n    issue for trial.â€™â€Â  Baughman v. American Telephone and Telegraph Co.,\r\n  306 S.C. 101, 115, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545 (1991) (emphasis in original) (citation\r\n  omitted).Â  The non-moving party must set forth facts, â€œas would be admissible\r\n  in evidence,â€ to show that a true jury issue exists.Â  Rule 56(e), SCRCP.Â \r\n  â€œUltimate or conclusory facts and conclusions of law, as well as statements on\r\n  â€˜information and beliefâ€™ cannot be utilized on a summary judgment motion.â€Â  Dawkins\r\n    v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 68, 580 S.E.2d 433, 438 (2003) (quoting Charles\r\n  Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure Â§ 2738 (3d ed. 2007)).Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDove Data claims the trial court erred in granting summary\r\n  judgment in favor of DeVeaux on Dove Dataâ€™s eight causes of action.[2]Â  Dove Data also claims the trial\r\n  court erred in dissolving the preliminary injunction against DeVeaux.\r\nI.Â Breach\r\n  of Contract \r\nDove\r\n  Data contends summary judgment on its breach of contract claim was improper\r\n  because the trial court improperly applied the additional consideration\r\n  requirement of a non-compete covenant to the non-solicitation clause provided\r\n  in the Employment Agreement.[3]Â \r\n  Regardless, Dove Data contends it presented evidence that it provided DeVeaux\r\n  additional consideration, other than â€œat-willâ€ employment, for entering the\r\n  Employment Agreement.Â   \r\nA.Â Non-Compete\r\n  vs. Non-Solicitation \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Dove Data claims non-solicitation covenants are separate and distinct\r\n  from non-compete covenants and, as such, do not require additional\r\n  consideration for support.Â  Dove Data further contends because DeVeaux signed\r\n  an earlier non-compete agreement in 1996, additional consideration was not\r\n  necessary when DeVeaux signed the Employment Agreement in 2001.Â  We disagree.Â Â \r\n \r\nSouth Carolina disfavors restrictive post-employment covenants and will critically examine\r\n  and construe such covenants against the employer.Â  See Rental Uniform\r\n    Serv. of Florence, Inc. v. Dudley, 278 S.C. 674, 301 S.E.2d 142 (1983); Oxman\r\n      v. Sherman, 239 S.C. 218, 122 S.E.2d 559 (1961); Faces Boutique, Ltd. v.\r\n        Gibbs, 318 S.C. 39, 41-42, 455 S.E.2d 707, 708 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  For this\r\n  type of restrictive covenant to be upheld, it must be: (1) necessary for the\r\n  protection of the legitimate interest of the employer; (2) reasonably limited\r\n  in its operation with respect to time and place; (3) not unduly harsh and\r\n  oppressive in curtailing the legitimate efforts of the employee to earn a\r\n  livelihood; (4) reasonable from the standpoint of sound public policy; and (5)\r\n  supported by valuable consideration.Â  Faces Boutique, Ltd., 318 S.C. at\r\n  42, 455 S.E.2d at 708.Â  When a restrictive covenant is included in an initial\r\n  contract of employment, at-will employment constitutes sufficient consideration\r\n  to support the covenant.Â  Riedman v. Jarosh, 290 S.C. 252, 349 S.E.2d\r\n  404 (1986).Â  However, when a covenant is entered into after the inception of\r\n  employment, separate consideration, in addition to continued at-will\r\n  employment, is necessary in order for the covenant to be enforceable.Â  Poole\r\n    v. Incentives Unlimited, Inc., 345 S.C. 378, 382, 548 S.E.2d 207, 209\r\n  (2001) (Poole II).  \r\nFirst, Dove Data claims there is a distinction between non-compete\r\n  and non-solicitation covenants and that no South Carolina court has applied the\r\n  additional consideration requirement, as discussed in Poole II, to a\r\n  non-solicitation covenant.Â Â  Thus, Dove Data contends the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  application of Poole II to this case was improper.\r\nDove Data correctly asserts a distinction exists between a\r\n  non-compete covenant and a non-solicitation covenant.Â  Typically a non-compete\r\n  covenant prohibits an employee from competing with an employer within a\r\n  specific geographic location and must be â€œreasonably limited in its operation\r\n  with respect to time and place.â€Â  Rockford Mfg., Ltd. v. Bennet,\r\n  296 F. Supp. 2d 681, 686 (D.S.C. 2003); Collins Music Co. v. Parent, 288\r\n  S.C. 91, 93, 340 S.E.2d 794, 795 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  A non-solicitation covenant\r\n  often does not contain a limitation as to place, as it restricts contacts with\r\n  existing customers rather than competition within a specific geographic area.Â  South Carolina law provides that a customer-based restriction can substitute for a\r\n  limitation as to a â€œplaceâ€ in a non-solicitation covenant.Â  Wolf v. Colonial\r\n    Life &amp; Acc. Ins., 309 S.C. 100, 109, 420 S.E.2d 217, 222 (Ct. App.\r\n  1992) (stating that â€œ[p]rohibitions against contacting existing customers can\r\n  be a valid substitute for a geographic limitationâ€).Â  We do not find any legal\r\n  distinction in these standards dispositive to this matter.  \r\nDove Data additionally claims, under this courtâ€™s intermediate\r\n  decision in Poole v. Incentives Unlimited, Inc., 338 S.C. 271, 274, 525\r\n  S.E.2d 898, 900 (Ct. App. 1999) (Poole I), additional consideration was\r\n  not necessary in this case because DeVeaux was already subject to an existing\r\n  non-compete covenant.Â  Dove Data contends this court found in Poole I,\r\n  if an at-will employment relationship already exists with a covenant not to\r\n  compete, any future restrictive covenant need not be based upon additional\r\n  consideration more than at-will employment.Â  Initially, we find Dove Data\r\n  erroneously interprets our holding in Poole I and ignores the holding of Poole II in which the supreme court â€œadopt[ed] the rule that when a\r\n  covenant is entered into after the inception of employment, separate\r\n  consideration, in addition to continued at-will employment, is necessary in\r\n  order for the covenant to be enforceable.â€Â  Poole II, 345 S.C. at\r\n  382, 548 S.E.2d at 209.Â  Regardless, Dove Dataâ€™s argument relies on the\r\n  unenforceable non-compete covenant contained in the 1996 Employee Non-Compete\r\n  Agreement.Â  The 1996 Employee Non-Compete Agreement had no geographic\r\n  limitation or customer-based limitation, rendering it void and unenforceable.Â  See,\r\n    e.g., Stonhard, Inc. v. Carolina Flooring Specialists, Inc., 366\r\n  S.C. 156, 160, 621 S.E.2d 352, 354 (2005) (a restrictive covenant without a\r\n  geographic limitation is void and unenforceable).Â   \r\nAccordingly, we find no reason to limit the additional\r\n  consideration requirement, as discussed in Poole II, solely to\r\n  non-compete covenants.[4]Â \r\n  Therefore, we hold the trial court properly applied Poole II to the\r\n  non-solicitation covenant contained in the Employment Agreement.\r\nB.Â Consideration \r\nRegardless\r\n  of whether the trial court improperly applied Poole II to this case,\r\n  Dove Data argues the trial court erred in precluding evidence of consideration\r\n  given to support the non-solicitation covenant contained in the Employment\r\n  Agreement.Â  We disagree.  \r\nAt trial, Dove Data argued it provided additional consideration to\r\n  DeVeaux for entering the Employment Agreement. Â Dove\r\n  Data averred DeVeaux received a $50 increase in his monthly vehicle allowance\r\n  as specific consideration for the Employment Agreement.[5] Â Â Dove\r\n  Data further argued the modification of the 1996 Employee Non-Compete Agreement\r\n  and its alleged forbearance of rights under this agreement constituted\r\n  additional consideration.Â  The trial court\r\n  found the Employment Agreement set forth the consideration that was exchanged\r\n  between the parties and found it did not reference any of the additional items\r\n  of consideration alleged by Dove Data. Â The\r\n  trial court, therefore, excluded the additional items under the parol evidence\r\n  rule.\r\nOn appeal Dove Data contends it was improper to exclude the parol\r\n  evidence of consideration because the language of consideration used in the\r\n  Employment Agreement was a â€œmere recital.â€Â   \r\nUnder South Carolina law, the parol evidence rule excludes\r\n  evidence which would give a perfectly clear agreement a different meaning or\r\n  effect than that indicated by the plain language of the agreement.Â  Taylor\r\n    by Taylor v. Taylor, 291 S.C. 261, 264, 353 S.E.2d 156, 158 (Ct. App.\r\n  1987).Â  If the writing on its face appears to express the whole agreement,\r\n  parol evidence cannot be admitted to add another term thereto.Â  Blackell v.\r\n    Faucett, 117 S.C. 60, 108 S.E. 295, 297 (1921).Â  The parol evidence rule is\r\n  particularly applicable where the writing in question has an integration\r\n  clause.Â  Wilson v. Landstrom, 281 S.C. 260, 266, 315 S.E.2d 130, 134\r\n  (Ct. App. 1984) (integrated agreement cannot be varied or contradicted by parol\r\n  evidence omitted from the writing).Â   \r\nAn exception to the parol evidence rules exists â€œwhen [the]\r\n  language of consideration [in an agreement] is intended as a mere recital.â€Â  Iseman\r\n    v. Hobbs, 290 S.C. 482, 483, 351 S.E.2d 351, 352 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  Further,\r\n  â€œparol evidence may be admitted to show a separate and independent agreement\r\n  which is not inconsistent with the terms of a contemporaneous agreement if it\r\n  can be inferred the parties did not intend the written paper to be a complete\r\n  integration of the agreement.â€Â  Beckham v. Short, 294 S.C. 415, 418, 365\r\n  S.E.2d 42, 43 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\nWe reject Dove Dataâ€™s claim that the consideration language\r\n  contained in the Employment Agreement was a â€œmere recital.â€Â  The Employment\r\n  Agreement provides, â€œin consideration of the premises and of the mutual\r\n  covenants and agreements herein contained, the parties hereto covenant and\r\n  agree as follows . . . .â€Â  The Employment Agreement then lists various promises Dove\r\n  Data made to DeVeaux.Â  The Employment Agreement contains no further recitals of\r\n  â€œother considerationâ€ that are not specifically referenced.Â  Furthermore, the\r\n  Employment Agreement contains a detailed integration clause to illustrate the\r\n  parties clearly intended the Employment Agreement would be a complete\r\n  integration of their agreement.Â Â   \r\nThus,\r\n  we find Dove Dataâ€™s purported evidence of the existence of additional\r\n  consideration for the Employment Agreement is inadmissible parol evidence and\r\n  hold the trial court properly precluded such evidence.  \r\nBecause\r\n  the Employment Agreement, and thereby the non-solicitation covenant, was\r\n  entered into after the inception of employment, separate consideration, in\r\n  addition to continued at-will employment, was necessary in order for the\r\n  covenant to be enforceable.Â  See Poole II, 345 S.C. at\r\n  382, 548 S.E.2d at 209.Â  A review of the arguments made to the trial court\r\n  reveals that separate and valuable consideration, in addition to continued\r\n  at-will employment, was not provided to DeVeaux for entering the Employment\r\n  Agreement.Â  Therefore, we find the trial court, in considering the specific\r\n  grounds raised, properly granted summary judgment in favor of DeVeaux on the\r\n  claim for breach of contract.\r\nFurther,\r\n  at oral argument Dove Data presented a new additional consideration argument.Â \r\n  Dove Data claimed the Employment Agreementâ€™s termination provision provided for\r\n  a two week notice period, not contained in the earlier Employee Non-Disclosure\r\n  Agreement.Â  In addition, the termination provision provides â€œ[Dove Data]\r\n  reserves the right to substitute two (2) weeksâ€™ severance pay in lieu of two\r\n  (2) weeksâ€™ previous notice in writing of termination.â€ Â Â \r\nValuable\r\n  consideration may consist of â€œsome right, interest, profit, or benefit accruing\r\n  to one party or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given,\r\n  suffered or undertaken by the other.â€Â  Prestwick Golf Club, Inc. v.\r\n    Prestwick Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 331 S.C. 385, 389, 503 S.E.2d 184, 186 (Ct. App.\r\n  1998).Â  A change in an employeeâ€™s contractual relationship with his employer\r\n  may suffice as consideration for entering a new employment contract, when it\r\n  confers a valuable benefit to the employee.Â  See, e.g.,Â  Std. Register\r\n    Co. v. Kerrigan, 238 S.C. 54, 73-74, 119 S.E.2d 533, 543-44 (1961).Â  \r\n \r\nThe court\r\n  recognizes, in this case, the change in the Employment Agreementâ€™s termination\r\n  provision conferred a valuable benefit to DeVeaux.Â  However, Dove Data failed\r\n  to raise this argument before the trial court or in its appellate brief.Â  The\r\n  first time Dove Data raised the claim that a change in the termination\r\n  provision sufficed as additional consideration was at oral argument before this\r\n  court.Â  Therefore, Dove\r\n  Dataâ€™s claim is not properly preserved for appellate review.Â  See Staubes\r\n    v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000)\r\n  (holding that issues must be raised and ruled upon in the trial court to be\r\n  preserved for appellate review).Â   \r\nII.Â Breach\r\n  of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\r\nDove\r\n  Data contends summary judgment on its breach of implied covenant of good faith\r\n  and fair dealing claim was improper because genuine issues of material fact\r\n  exist as to the validity and enforceability of the Employment Agreement.Â  We\r\n  disagree.  \r\nA claim\r\n  for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is considered to\r\n  be subsumed within a claim for breach of contract and no longer exists as an\r\n  independent cause of action.Â  RoTec Servs., Inc. v. Encompass Servs., Inc.,\r\n  359 S.C. 467, 473, 597 S.E.2d 881, 884 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Accordingly, because\r\n  we find summary judgment was proper on the claim for breach of contract, we\r\n  find no error in the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment on this claim.\r\nIII.Â Misappropriation\r\n  of Trade Secrets\r\nDove\r\n  Data claims summary judgment was improper on its violation of the South\r\n  Carolina Uniform Trade Secrets Act (the Act) claim because it presented\r\n  evidence DeVeaux misappropriated Dove Dataâ€™s trade secrets. We disagree.\r\n \r\nThe Act\r\n  states â€œ[e]very employee who is informed of or should reasonably have known\r\n  from the circumstances of the existence of any employerâ€™s trade secret has a\r\n  duty to refrain from using or disclosing the trade secret without the employerâ€™s\r\n  permission.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-8-30(B) (Supp. 2006).Â  The Act defines\r\n  misappropriation as the use of a trade secret, without consent, by a person who\r\n  knew or had reason to know that his knowledge of the trade secret, under the\r\n  circumstances, gave â€œrise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use.â€Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-8-20(2)(c)(ii)(B) (Supp. 2006).Â  The Act defines â€œtrade\r\n  secret[s]â€ as â€œinformation including, but not limited to, a formula, pattern,\r\n  compilation, program, device, method, technique, product, system, or process,\r\n  design, prototype, procedure, or codeâ€ that derives independent economic value\r\n  from both being generally known to others who could obtain economic value from\r\n  its disclosure and is the subject of efforts used to maintain its secrecy.Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 39-8-20(5)(a) (Supp. 2006).Â   \r\nDove\r\n  Data contends it gave DeVeaux trade secrets, including customer and pricing\r\n  lists, profit margins and operating policies, and that he is now using the\r\n  information to compete directly with Dove Data.Â  The trial court found no\r\n  specific evidence DeVeaux was physically in possession of the information or\r\n  that he misappropriated the information. Â Â The trial court found the only specific allegation offered\r\n  by Dove Data was that DeVeaux purportedly admitted to Opel he provided two\r\n  individuals with a copy of the preliminary injunction and attached list of\r\n  customer names.Â  The trial court held, assuming DeVeaux did give the document\r\n  to other people, neither the preliminary injunction nor the attached customer\r\n  list could constitute a trade secret because they were public court\r\n  documents.Â Â  Thus, the trial court found the record did not contain any\r\n  specific, admissible evidence DeVeaux engaged in misappropriation and\r\n  therefore, did not reach the issue of whether the information provided to\r\n  DeVeaux actually constituted trade secrets under the Act.\r\n&nbsp;We\r\n  agree with the trial court that whatever trade secret status Dove Data believed\r\n  it had in the names of its customers was lost the moment it was filed as part\r\n  of the public record.[6]Â  See Id. (defining a trade secret as something that cannot be\r\n  â€œreadily ascertainable by proper means by the publicâ€).Â  In light of our\r\n  disposition, we need not address whether the information provided to DeVeaux by\r\n  Dove Data constitutes a â€œtrade secretâ€ under the Act.Â  See Hagood v.\r\n    Sommerville, 362 S.C. 191, 199, 607 S.E.2d 707, 711 (2005) (stating the\r\n  appellate court need not address additional issues when resolution of prior\r\n  issue is dispositive).Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nDove Data also argues it can prove its claim of trade secret\r\n  misappropriation by demonstrating DeVeauxâ€™s new employment will inevitably lead\r\n  him to rely on the information provided by Dove Data.Â  Dove Dataâ€™s inevitable\r\n  disclosure argument was not raised or ruled upon at the trial court level and\r\n  therefore, we find the issue is not adequately preserved for review.Â  See Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546\r\n  (2000) (holding that issues must be raised and ruled upon in the trial court to\r\n  be preserved for appellate review).\r\nTherefore, we find the trial court properly granted summary\r\n  judgment on Dove Dataâ€™s misappropriation of trade secrets claim in favor of\r\n  DeVeaux.Â Â Â Â Â   \r\nIV. Tortious\r\n  Interference with Contractual Relations \r\nDove\r\n  Data further asserts summary judgment on its tortious interference with\r\n  contractual relations claim was improper because it presented evidence of\r\n  contracts with customers in DeVeauxâ€™s former territory and evidence DeVeaux\r\n  interfered with those contracts.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nTo\r\n  state a cause of action for interference with a contractual relationship, the\r\n  plaintiff must prove: (1) the existence of a contract; (2) knowledge of the\r\n  contract by the tortfeasor; (3) intentional procurement by the tortfeasor of\r\n  the contractâ€™s breach; (4) absence of justification; and (5) damages resulting\r\n  therefrom.Â  Love v. Gamble, 316 S.C. 203, 213-14, 448 S.E.2d 876, 882\r\n  (Ct. App. 1994).Â   \r\nThe trial court found Dove Data could not prove the existence of a\r\n  contract and thus, there was no cause of action for intentional interference\r\n  with a contractual relationship.Â  During Dove Dataâ€™s 30(b)(6) deposition, Dove Data admitted\r\n  that it did not have contracts with any of the customers located in DeVeauxâ€™s\r\n  former sales territory.Â  Dove Data also admitted that no customers breached or\r\n  canceled contracts as a result of DeVeauxâ€™s alleged actions.Â  The trial court\r\n  relied on these admissions to grant summary judgment on this claim.\r\nÂ On appeal, Dove Data contends the supplemental affidavit of David\r\n  Harris, Dove Dataâ€™s vice president of administration, provides evidence DeVeaux\r\n  interfered with its contracts.Â  Harrisâ€™ affidavit reads â€œ[DeVeaux] interfered\r\n  with contracts held by Dove Data.â€Â  The trial court reviewed the supplemental\r\n  affidavit and found it contained â€œconclusory allegations . . . [that] added\r\n  nothing probative and did not resolve the admitted factual defects with this\r\n  claim.â€Â  We agree.Â  A party opposing summary judgment must do more than rely on\r\n  mere allegations.Â  Dyer v. Moss, 284 S.C. 208, 211, 325 S.E.2d 69, 70\r\n  (Ct. App. 1985).Â  The affidavit fails to identify any contract, date of breach,\r\n  customer who breached its contract, or damage incurred because of any action on\r\n  the part of DeVeaux.Â  Therefore, we find the trial court properly granted\r\n  summary judgment on the tortious interference with contractual relations claim\r\n  in favor of DeVeaux.Â Â Â Â Â   \r\nV. Intentional\r\n  Interference with Prospective Contractual Relations \r\nDove Data also asserts summary judgment on its intentional\r\n  interference with prospective contractual relations claim was improper because\r\n  Dove Data presented evidence it lost potential contracts and business as a\r\n  result of DeVeauxâ€™s disclosure of confidential information.Â  We disagree.Â \r\n \r\nThe elements for the tort of intentional interference with\r\n  prospective contractual relations are: (1) intentional interference with the\r\n  plaintiffâ€™s potential contractual relations; (2) for an improper purpose or by\r\n  improper methods; and (3) causing injury to the plaintiff.Â  United Educ. Distribs.,\r\n    LLC v. Educ. Testing Serv., 350 S.C. 7, 14, 564 S.E.2d 324, 328 (Ct. App.\r\n  2002).Â   \r\nHere, the trial court found Dove Data failed to evince prospective\r\n  contractual relations based on the nature of Dove Dataâ€™s business not to enter\r\n  formal contractual relations with its customers.Â  However, â€œ[t]he reasonable\r\n  expectation [of business relations] need not be based on an enforceable\r\n  contract.â€ Â Id. at 16, 564 S.E.2d at 329.Â  As such, the fact that Dove\r\n  Data did not enter into formal contracts with customers does not preclude Dove\r\n  Data from claiming a reasonable expectation of business with a particular\r\n  customer. Â Notwithstanding, we agree with the ultimate conclusion of the trial\r\n  court that Dove Data failed to provide evidence to support an intentional\r\n  interference with prospective contractual relations claim because the record\r\n  does not support the necessary specificity as to any prospective contract or\r\n  business expectation that would have been entered or obtained but for the\r\n  alleged wrongful interference of DeVeaux.\r\nIn United Educational Distributors, LLC, after reviewing\r\n  the limited South Carolina precedent on an intentional interference of\r\n  prospective contractual relations claim, this court indicated a plaintiff must\r\n  demonstrate â€œthe loss of an identifiable contract or [identifiable]\r\n  expectation.â€ Â Id. at 14, 564 S.E.2d at 328 (citations omitted); see Love, 316 S.C. at 205-07, 448 S.E.2d at 877-78 (alleged interference\r\n  with pickle supply contract); see also S. Contracting Inc. v. H. C.\r\n    Brown Constr. Co., 317 S.C. 95, 96-97, 450 S.E.2d 602, 603-04 (Ct. App.\r\n  1994) (alleged interference with subcontracting agreement).Â  Accordingly, this\r\n  court determined that a general allegation of interference absent a specific\r\n  interference with a particular prospective contract or identifiable business\r\n  expectation is insufficient to support this claim. Â United Educ. Distribs.,\r\n    LLC, 350 S.C. at 14-18, 564 S.E.2d at 328-330; see Gaillard v.\r\n      Fleet Mortgage Corp., 880 F. Supp. 1085 (D.S.C. 1995) (dismissing\r\n  intentional interference with prospective contractual relations claim because\r\n  plaintiff merely alleged general interference with potential clients). Â Further,\r\n  a plaintiff asserting this cause of action must demonstrate the reasonable\r\n  probability of entering into a specific contract or business expectation but\r\n  for the interference of defendant. Â Â United Educ. Distribs., LLC, 350\r\n  S.C. at 18, 564 S.E.2d at 330; see Walker v. Sloan, 137\r\n  N.C.App. 387, 393, 529 S.E.2d 236, 242 (2000); see also Kramer v.\r\n    Pollock-Krasner Found., 890 F. Supp 250, 258 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (holding\r\n  intentional interference with prospective contractual relations claims â€œmust\r\n  specify some particular, existing business relationship through which plaintiff\r\n  would have done business but for the allegedly tortious behaviorâ€).Â   \r\nHere, Dove Data has not demonstrated the loss of a specific\r\n  prospective contract or a business expectation. Rather, Dove Data alleges\r\n  generally DeVeauxâ€™s interference caused Dove Data to lose business. Dove Data\r\n  asserts Harrisâ€™ affidavit provides evidence of its lost business. The affidavit\r\n  states, â€œ[DeVeaux]â€™s interference resulted in Dove Data losing contracts that\r\n  would be valuable to Dove Dataâ€™s business . . . Dove Data has lost potential\r\n  contracts to [two competitors] as a result of [DeVeaux]â€™s disclosure of Dove\r\n  Dataâ€™s confidential information.â€Â  These allegations, however, are general\r\n  assertions that do not identify a specific prospective contract or a particular\r\n  business expectation Dove Data would have obtained but lost due to the alleged\r\n  improper interference. Having failed to specify an identifiable prospective\r\n  contract or identifiable prospective business expectation it would have entered\r\n  or obtained but for DeVeauxâ€™s interference, Dove Data has failed to demonstrate\r\n  any genuine issue of material fact as to at least one of the elements of the\r\n  claim for intentional interference with prospective contractual relations.\r\nTherefore, we find the trial court properly granted summary\r\n  judgment on the intentional interference with prospective contractual relations\r\n  claim in favor of DeVeaux.\r\nVI. Breach\r\n  of the Employee Duty of Loyalty\r\nDove Data further contends DeVeaux breached his duty of loyalty by\r\n  forming Southpoint specifically for the purpose of competing with Dove Data.Â \r\n  We disagree.  \r\nâ€œIt is\r\n  implicit in any contract for employment that the employee shall remain faithful\r\n  to the employerâ€™s interest throughout the term of employment.Â  An employee has\r\n  a duty of fidelity to his employer.â€Â  Berry v. Goodyear, 270 S.C. 489,\r\n  491, 242 S.E.2d 551, 552 (1978).Â  Solicitation of an employerâ€™s customers is a\r\n  breach of the duty of loyalty.Â  Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown,\r\n    Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 606, 518 S.E.2d 591, 595 (1999).Â  However, â€œmerely\r\n  preparing and submitting forms to create a new corporation . . . likely will be\r\n  seen as permissible pretermination planning.â€Â  Id. at 610, 518 S.E.2d at\r\n  597.  \r\nOn appeal, Dove Data bases its claim on DeVeauxâ€™s formation of\r\n  Southpoint, three months prior to his resignation, and provides only a\r\n  conclusory allegation DeVeaux was â€œactively competingâ€ against Dove Data. Â Â DeVeauxâ€™s\r\n  actions relating to the formation of Southpoint were permissible under South Carolina law and thereby not a breach of the duty of loyalty.Â  Further, after a\r\n  review of the record, we find no evidence of a specific date, customer or\r\n  circumstance of a pretermination solicitation by DeVeaux.Â  Therefore, we find\r\n  the trial court properly granted summary judgment on the breach of the duty of\r\n  loyalty claim in favor of DeVeaux.Â Â Â Â Â   \r\nVII. Unfair\r\n  Trade Practices Act \r\nLastly,\r\n  Dove Data alleges summary judgment was improper because DeVeauxâ€™s actions have\r\n  harmed and continue to harm the public in violation of the South Carolina\r\n  Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA).Â  We disagree.\r\nUTPA\r\n  provides that unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or\r\n  practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are declared unlawful.Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-20(a) (Supp. 2006).Â  Section 39-5-140(a) creates a private\r\n  right of action in favor of â€œ[a]ny person who suffers any ascertainable loss of\r\n  money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment by\r\n  another person of an unfair or deceptive method.â€Â  However, to be actionable,\r\n  the alleged unfair or deceptive acts or practices must adversely affect the\r\n  â€œpublic interest,â€ not merely the interests of the private parties to the\r\n  particular dispute.Â  Noack Enters., Inc. v. Country Corner Interiors of\r\n    Hilton Head Island, Inc., 290 S.C. 475, 479, 351 S.E.2d 347, 350 (Ct. App.\r\n  1986) (â€œ[t]he act is not available to redress a private wrong where the public\r\n  interest is unaffectedâ€).  \r\nDove Data claims DeVeauxâ€™s misappropriation of trade secrets has\r\n  an adverse impact on the public.Â  Dove Data suggests DeVeauxâ€™s actions will\r\n  cause businesses to be â€œless effective,â€ will harm â€œall industries,â€ will â€œcast\r\n  a negative shadow on the technology industry,â€ and will cause the public not to\r\n  trust the technology industry.Â  The trial court found Dove Dataâ€™s assertions\r\n  â€œwholly unsupported by any admissible evidence.â€Â  We agree.Â   \r\nOur courts have made it clear that UTPA is not available to\r\n  redress a private wrong where the public interest is unaffected.Â  UTPA is not\r\n  an alternative vehicle to pursue an alleged breach of contract.Â  See, e.g., Key Co., v. Fameco Distribs., Inc., 292 S.C. 524, 526-27, 357 S.E.2d\r\n  476, 478 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Even an intentional breach of a contract does not\r\n  rise to the level of a violation of UTPA.Â  Id.Â  The supreme court\r\n  addressed a similar UTPA claim between a business and a former employee, turned\r\n  competitor, in the case of Florence Paper Co. v. Orphan, 298 S.C. 210,\r\n  379 S.E.2d 289 (1989).Â  In Florence, employer alleged employeeâ€™s use of\r\n  privileged information concerning employerâ€™s customers constituted unfair\r\n  methods of competition and entitled employer to bring his cause of action under\r\n  UTPA.Â  Id. at 212, 379 S.E.2d at 291.Â  The supreme court upheld the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment on the UTPA claim on the basis that the\r\n  public interest was unaffected by a dispute between two direct competitors over\r\n  customer relationships and alleged interference with contract.Â  Id. at 213, 379 S.E.2d at 291.Â  \r\n \r\nAs in Florence, Dove Data failed to present evidence the\r\n  greater public interest was actually affected by DeVeauxâ€™s actions.Â  Therefore,\r\n  we find the trial court properly granted summary judgment on the UTPA claim in\r\n  favor of DeVeaux.Â Â Â   \r\nVIII.Â  Preliminary\r\n  InjunctionÂ  \r\nIn addition, Dove Data argues if this court were to find summary\r\n  judgment improper as to any one of Dove Dataâ€™s eight causes, the preliminary injunction\r\n  should be reinstated.Â  The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve\r\n  the status quo to avoid possible irreparable injury to a party pending\r\n  litigation.Â  Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 601, 553\r\n  S.E.2d 110, 121 (2001).Â  Because we affirm the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary\r\n  judgment on all eight causes of action in favor of DeVeaux, there is no\r\n  continuing basis for the preliminary injunction.Â  Therefore, we find the trial\r\n  court did not err in dissolving the preliminary injunction.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, the trial courtâ€™s order is  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and PIEPER,\r\n  JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â Â Â Â   \r\n\r\n[1] DeVeaux was an â€œat-willâ€ employee at\r\n  all times.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\n[2] Additionally, Dove Data contends summary judgment as\r\n  to all eight causes of action was premature because it did not have a fair and\r\n  full opportunity to complete discovery.Â  Dove Data did not object and, in fact,\r\n  assented to moving forward with the summary judgment motion. Â A party\r\n  cannot complain of a ruling, which the party itself induced or invited the\r\n  trial court to make.Â  Floyd v. Thorton, 220 S.C. 414, 426, 68 S.E.2d\r\n  334, 339-40 (1951).Â   \r\n[3] Although the covenant not to compete in the\r\n  Employment Agreement contained various post-employment restrictions, Dove Data\r\n  seeks only to enforce the non-solicitation clause.Â   \r\n[4] In fact, federal courts have already\r\n  applied Poole II to non-solicitation covenants in several cases.Â  See,\r\n    e.g., Rockford Mfg., 296 F. Supp. 2d 681, 690 (citing Poole II as applicable to non-solicitation covenant); Nucor Corp. v. Bell, 482 F.\r\n  Supp. 2d 714, 730 (D.S.C. 2007) (noting the rationale of Poole II and\r\n  applying Rockford to non-solicitation and non-disclosure covenants).Â  \r\n \r\n[5] This argument first arose in Dove Dataâ€™s Rule\r\n  30(b)(6) deposition of Mark Opel (Opel), the vice-president of sales for Dove\r\n  Data.Â   \r\n[6] No attempt was made to file the list under seal\r\n  nor was any attempt made to subject the list to a confidentiality agreement.\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-203","title":"State v.

Weissenstein, Jr., of Sumter, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tKenneth R. Young, Jr., of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In\r\n  this property dispute, Richard Weeks appeals the special refereeâ€™s order\r\n  determining property boundary lines and awarding damages to adjacent Whiteâ€™s\r\n  Mill Colony, Inc.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nWe\r\n  note at the commencement that the facts largely mirror those discussed in Whiteâ€™s\r\n    Mill Colony, Inc. v. Williams, 363 S.C. 117, 609 S.E.2d 811 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005).Â  At the center of this dispute is an eighty-eight acre man-made pond in Sumter County known as â€œWhiteâ€™s Mill Pondâ€ (Pond).[1]&nbsp;\r\n  In 1955, Whiteâ€™s Mill Colony, Inc. (Colony) obtained title to the land located\r\n  to the north and east of the Pond as well as title to the bed of the Pond\r\n  itself. Â Land along the south and west sides of the Pond subsequently came into\r\n  the possession of the defendants in this case, including the Appellant, Richard\r\n  Weeks (Weeks).&nbsp;  \r\nThe\r\n  Colony filed suit against the abutting landowners alleging some of them used the\r\n  Pond in a variety of ways, including fishing, boating, dredging soil, removing\r\n  trees from along the side of the Pond, and building docks into the Pond. The\r\n  abutting landowners counterclaimed, alleging their use and enjoyment of their\r\n  property had been disturbed by the Colony. The matter was referred to a special\r\n  referee (Referee) for a determination of the partiesâ€™ respective rights. \r\n \r\nIn his\r\n  October 2002 order, the Referee determined the case involved two issues: first,\r\n  whether the Pond is a navigable watercourse under South Carolina law giving\r\n  rise to a public right of access to the Pond; and second, whether the abutting\r\n  landowners held a private right to access and use the Pond arising from their\r\n  putative status as riparian or littoral owners.&nbsp; The Referee found neither\r\n  right existed and the abutting landowners were therefore enjoined from boating\r\n  or fishing on the Pond, dredging or interfering with the Pondâ€™s bed, cutting any\r\n  timber from the bed of the Pond, or building any structures on the bed of the Pond,\r\n  unless the structures were over property owned by the abutting landowners. The\r\n  Referee also awarded damages to the Colony for the damage done to its property,\r\n  however, the Referee did not make a determination as to the property lines of\r\n  the parcels surrounding the Pond or if the abutting landowners owned part of\r\n  the Pondâ€™s bed. Â The abutting landowners appealed.\r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed the Refereeâ€™s findings to the extent the\r\n  Colony owned the subaqueous land, but vacated the award of damages and remanded\r\n  the matter for determination of the precise property boundaries and,\r\n  concomitantly, reconsideration of the damage awards. Â After further hearings\r\n  the Referee issued a May 2006 order which set forth the boundaries of the\r\n  abutting landownersâ€™ properties and the damages each landowner owed to the\r\n  Colony for their trespassing, removal of trees, and dredging. Â Weeks\r\n  appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen the parties seek both legal and equitable relief, characterization\r\n  of the action as legal or equitable depends upon the main purpose of the suit. Corley v.\r\n    Looper, 287 S.C. 618, 620, 340 S.E.2d 556, 557 (Ct. App. 1986).Â \r\n  The Colonyâ€™s complaint alleged they were the sole and exclusive owner of the\r\n  Pond. Â Following an appeal to this Court, the case was remanded to the Referee\r\n  to determine ownership of the bed of the Pond and thus the boundary lines of\r\n  the properties abutting the Pond.Â  Determining title to a disputed tract of\r\n  land is an action at law.Â  Ward v. Woodward, 287 S.C. 343, 344-45, 338\r\n  S.E.2d 347, 348 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  At oral argument, Weeks conceded the action\r\n  involved a boundary line dispute and is an action at law.Â  In an action at law,\r\n  tried without a jury, the appellate court standard of review extends only to\r\n  the correction of errors of law. Id. at 345, 338 S.E.2d 348.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Determining Boundary Lines\r\nWeeksâ€™\r\n  property is adjacent to property once owned by Dorothy and Spann Jones. In\r\n  February 1994, Benjamin Makela surveyed the Jonesesâ€™ property. A drafting error\r\n  occurred in the process of transforming Makelaâ€™s field notes into a plat such\r\n  that the Jonesesâ€™ plat erroneously reflected their property continued eighty\r\n  feet out into the Pond. Makela testified the error on the 1994 Jones plat was\r\n  perpetuated on plats drafted for Weeks in 1999 and 2000. As a result, Weeksâ€™\r\n  plats show eighty feet of dry land that in actuality is submerged below the\r\n  Pond. Weeks testified that in dredging and clearing trees he relied upon the\r\n  two plats of his property which depict the edge of his property as being eighty\r\n  feet out into the Pond.  \r\nWeeks\r\n  contends the Referee did not give adequate consideration to Makelaâ€™s field\r\n  notes. Makelaâ€™s field notes, testimony, and plats he created for Weeks and the\r\n  Joneses were admitted into evidence. Â In determining the property boundaries of\r\n  the abutting landowners the Referee came to his conclusion after considering\r\n  â€œthe entirety of the record, to include the multiple plats and deeds, most of\r\n  which conflict with one another to some extent, and the credibility of the\r\n  witnesses as [he] observed them at trial.â€ Accordingly, we can find no error in\r\n  the Refereeâ€™s holding with regard to Makelaâ€™s field notes.\r\nWeeks\r\n  also contends the Referee should have determined the exact location of the\r\n  Pondâ€™s â€œhigh water mark.â€Â  The Referee determined each defendant abutting\r\n  landowner was conveyed property â€œbordered by the Pond but that neither the Pond\r\n  itself nor any proprietary interest in the Pond was conveyed.â€Â  In determining\r\n  the abutting landownersâ€™ property lines, the Referee referenced and\r\n  incorporated a May 2002 survey by Lindler Land Surveying, LLC, into his order.Â \r\n  The Lindler survey shows Weeksâ€™ property and depicts a high water mark on all\r\n  the properties portrayed.Â  Accordingly, we can find no error in the Refereeâ€™s\r\n  holding with regard to the high water mark.\r\nII.&nbsp; Determining Damages\r\nIn\r\n  his May 2006 order, the Referee awarded damages to the Colony for the abutting\r\n  landownersâ€™ removal of trees, dredging, and trespassing on property belonging\r\n  to the Colony. The Refereeâ€™s award of damages was guided by the balancing act\r\n  found in Vaught v. A.O. Hardee and Sons, Inc., a 2005 case in which the\r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court set forth a method of measuring damages for\r\n  destroyed noncommercial trees.Â  366 S.C. 475, 623 S.E.2d 373 (2005).Â   \r\nWeeks\r\n  argues the Referee did not set forth the basis for his award of damages.Â  The\r\n  Referee specifically explained the Colonyâ€™s request for replacement value of\r\n  the trees removed by abutting landowners was unreasonable compared to the\r\n  damage inflicted to the Colonyâ€™s property.Â  He also found the abutting\r\n  landowners method of â€œcalculating the damages as a slight percentage of the tax-assessed\r\n  value of the entire Pondâ€ would be unfair.Â  The Referee further explained he\r\n  applied the considerations set forth in Vaught to the greater weight of\r\n  the evidence while taking into account the credibility of the witnesses and\r\n  submitted evidence in arriving at the amounts awarded to the Colony from each\r\n  abutting landowner. Â Accordingly, we can find no error by the Referee in\r\n  the method of determining damages.\r\nWeeks\r\n  further argues the Referee erred on remand by increasing the damages Weeks owed\r\n  to the Colony.Â  On appeal this court vacated the damages awarded by the\r\n  Refereeâ€™s October 2002 order and remanded the case so the Referee could\r\n  determine the property lines of the abutting landowners and â€œreconsider the\r\n  matter of damages in light of the true boundary lines.â€ Whiteâ€™s Mill Colony,\r\n    Inc. v. Williams, 363 S.C. 117, 135-36, 609 S.E.2d 811, 821 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005).Â  On remand the Referee admitted the 1999 and 2000 plats of Weeksâ€™\r\n  property and heard testimony from Weeks regarding his reliance on Makelaâ€™s\r\n  surveys when removing trees and dredging portions of the Pond he believed he\r\n  owned.Â  The Referee noted in his May 2006 order that in addition to the\r\n  guidance of Vaught, he also considered â€œthe added factor of the greater\r\n  extent of [the Colonyâ€™s] property found to be damaged by certain [abutting\r\n  landowners] in light of the boundary line determinations.â€Â  We can find no\r\n  error in the Refereeâ€™s award of damages following remand.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Admitting Evidence\r\nFollowing\r\n  remand the Referee conducted evidentiary hearings. At a later hearing for the\r\n  purposes of closing arguments, another abutting landowner moved to reopen the\r\n  record to allow admission of an additional survey made after the courtâ€™s last\r\n  evidentiary hearing several months prior.Â  The motion was denied. Â While the\r\n  survey was made part of the record, it was not considered by the Referee in his\r\n  decision.  \r\nWeeks\r\n  argues the Referee erred by not admitting this additional survey into\r\n  evidence.Â  The admission or exclusion of evidence is a matter addressed to the\r\n  sound discretion of the trial court and its ruling will not be disturbed on\r\n  appeal absent a manifest abuse of discretion. Connor v. City of Forest Acres, 363 S.C. 460, 467, 611 S.E.2d 905, 908 (2005).Â  We\r\n  can find no such abuse in this matter.\r\nAccordingly\r\n  the order of the Referee is  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, SHORT, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The Pond has been previously adjudicated to be a\r\n  non-navigable waterway.Â  Whiteâ€™s Mill Colony, Inc. v.

Derham Cole, Circuit Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2008-UP-205\r\nSubmitted March 4, 2008 â€“ Filed March 25,\r\n  2008\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tJoseph E. Baumie, of Inman, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tEric C. Hale and Roy W. Boggs, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  A\r\n  credit card holder, Joseph E. Baumie, argues the circuit court erred in\r\n  confirming an arbitration award issued by the National Arbitration Forum in\r\n  favor of MBNA America Bank, N.A., the issuer of Baumieâ€™s credit card.&nbsp;\r\n  Specifically, Baumie argues MBNA failed to produce evidence of an arbitration\r\n  agreement between the parties.&nbsp; We reverse.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nMBNA filed an arbitration claim against\r\n  Baumie in the National Arbitration Forum (Forum) alleging it had issued Baumie a\r\n  credit card and he subsequently defaulted on their agreement.Â  Baumie contested\r\n  arbitration several times in writing to the Forum, asserting he never agreed to\r\n  arbitrate.Â  Despite Baumieâ€™s assertions, the Forum went forward with the\r\n  arbitration and determined the parties entered into an arbitration agreement. Â The\r\n  Forum found in favor of MBNA in the amount of $11,241.84.Â   \r\nMBNA filed a complaint in circuit court\r\n  seeking confirmation of the arbitration award.Â  Baumie answered and filed a counterclaim\r\n  and a motion to dismiss.Â  MBNA filed a motion to confirm the arbitration\r\n  award, and Baumie filed a motion opposing the confirmation.Â  Following a\r\n  hearing, the circuit court took the matter under advisement, and subsequently\r\n  issued an order confirming the award and entering judgment against Baumie in\r\n  the amount of $11,241.84.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nUnless the parties otherwise provide, the question of\r\n  the arbitrability of a claim is an issue for judicial determination. Â Zabinski\r\n    v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 596, 553 S.E.2d 110, 118 (2001). Â Determinations\r\n  of arbitrability are subject to de novo review, but if any evidence reasonably\r\n  supports the circuit courtâ€™s factual findings, this court will not overrule\r\n  those findings.Â  Stokes v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 351 S.C. 606, 609-10,\r\n  571 S.E.2d 711, 713 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBaumie\r\n  argues the circuit court erred by confirming the arbitration award because MBNA\r\n  had not produced sufficient evidence of an arbitration agreement.Â  We agree.Â \r\n \r\nThe Federal\r\n  Arbitration Act requires courts to enforce privately negotiated arbitration\r\n  agreements according to their terms.Â  Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346\r\n  S.C. 580, 592, 553 S.E.2d 110, 116&nbsp;(2001).Â  However, â€œarbitration is a matter of contract, and a\r\n  party cannot be required to arbitrate any dispute which he has not agreed to\r\n  arbitrate.â€ Chassereau v. Global Sun Pools, Inc., 373 S.C. 168, 171-2,\r\n  644 S.E.2d 718, 720&nbsp;(2007) (citing Zabinski at 596, 553 S.E.2d at\r\n  118).Â   \r\nIf a\r\n  party challenges the enforcement of an arbitration award on the grounds that\r\n  there was not an arbitration agreement between the parties, it naturally\r\n  follows the court must first ascertain whether the agreement actually existed.Â \r\n  The party seeking enforcement of the award, then, must present evidence of the\r\n  agreement itself because â€œ[t]he burden is on a party pleading a fact to prove\r\n  it.â€Â  Jackson v. Frier, 146 S.C. 322, 144 S.E. 66,\r\n  68,&nbsp;(1928); Hammond v. Halsey, 287 S.C. 46, 49, 336 S.E.2d 495,\r\n  497&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1985).\r\nIn the instant\r\n  case, the only evidence of the arbitration agreement provided by MBNA was a photocopy\r\n  of a seven-page pamphlet entitled â€œCredit Card Agreement Additional Terms and\r\n  Conditions,â€ outlining the terms and conditions of an agreement.Â  However, MBNA\r\n  offers no evidence to authenticate the pamphlet or show it was in fact sent to Baumie.Â  Furthermore, while the pamphlet explains the terms of an arbitration\r\n  agreement, its language merely refers to some other agreement.Â  Outside of the\r\n  pamphlet, MBNA did not provide any evidence whatsoever of any actual agreement\r\n  between itself and Baumie, nor did it produce any evidence that Baumie in fact\r\n  agreed to arbitration.Â  Accordingly, because MBNA failed to produce any\r\n  evidence of an actual arbitration agreement between the parties, the circuit\r\n  court erred in confirming the arbitration award.\r\nWe\r\n  note several other jurisdictions[2] have arrived at similar decisions regarding whether consumers agreed to\r\n  arbitration with MBNA. See, e.g., MBNA Am. Bank, N.A. v. Boata,\r\n  893 A.2d 479 (Conn. App. 2006); MBNA Am. Bank, N.A. v. Rogers, 838\r\n  N.E.2d 475 (Ind. App. 2005); MBNA Am. Bank, N.A. v. Hart, 710 N.W.2d 125\r\n  (N.D. 2006); MBNA Am. Bank, N.A. v. Terry, 2006 WL 513952 (Ohio Ct. App.\r\n  2006); MBNA Am. Bank, N.A. v. Berlin, 2005 WL 3193850 (Ohio Ct. App.\r\n  2005); MBNA Am. Bank, N.A. v. Perese, 2006 WL 398188 (Texas App. 2006).Â \r\n  In a similar case involving MBNA, the Kansas Supreme Court addressed this very\r\n  issue and found:\r\n\r\n\tMBNA\r\n  failed to attach a copy of the arbitration agreement to its motion to confirm\r\n  the award. Â This violated the Federal Arbitration Act for which MBNA\r\n  intermittently expresses respect. . . . This alone would have justified the district\r\n  court in its decision to deny MBNAâ€™s motion to confirm the award.Â  \r\n\r\nMBNA Am. Bank, N.A. v.\r\n  Credit, 132 P.3d 898, 901 (Kan. 2006) (citing 9 U.S.C.\r\n  Â§ 13 (2000)).Â  According to 9 U.S.C.A. Â§ 13 (2000):\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  party moving for an order confirming, modifying, or correcting an award shall,\r\n  at the time such order is filed with the clerk for the entry of judgment\r\n  thereon, also file the following papers with the clerk: (a) The agreement; the selection or\r\n  appointment, if any, of an additional arbitrator or umpire; and each written\r\n  extension of the time, if any, within which to make the award.\r\n\r\nWhile the language of the\r\n  statute requires the clerk to file the agreement with the judgment and does not\r\n  address the documents to be filed when commencing an action to confirm the award,\r\n  it does not relieve MBNA of the burden of showing an agreement to arbitrate existed.Â \r\n  As stated by the Kansas Supreme Court, â€œ[g]iven MBNAâ€™s casual approach to this\r\n  litigation, we are not surprised that [a national trend in which consumers are\r\n  questioning MBNA and whether arbitration agreements exist] may be growing.â€Â  Credit,\r\n  132 P.3d at 902.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause MBNA failed\r\n  to produce evidence showing an arbitration agreement between itself and Baumie,\r\n  the circuit court erred in confirming the arbitration award.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  order of the circuit court is  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nANDERSON, SHORT, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] This court has also recently addressed this issue in MBNA Am.

Jordan, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This\r\n  case arises from a contract between Pools Plus, Inc. and Angela Timmons for\r\n  Pools Plus to construct an in-ground swimming pool on Timmonsâ€™s property. Â Timmons\r\n  withheld partial payment after determining the pool was unsatisfactory.Â \r\n  Timmons appeals the trial courtâ€™s introduction of the contract into evidence\r\n  and the award of prejudgment interest to Pools Plus.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\n1.&nbsp; Timmons\r\n  contracted with Pools Plus to install an in-ground swimming pool on her\r\n  property.Â  Upon completion of the pool,\r\n  Timmons was dissatisfied, claiming the pool leaked, filled with dirt during\r\n  heavy rain, and had other malfunctions.Â  Timmons refused to pay the\r\n  approximately $8800 remaining due on the contract.Â  Pools Plus filed a lawsuit\r\n  seeking to recover the money owed.Â  At trial, Pools Plus offered into evidence\r\n  a contract detailing the agreement between the parties.Â  The contract was only\r\n  signed by an employee of Pools Plus.Â  The trial court admitted the contract\r\n  over the objection of Timmons, who argued the contract could not represent the\r\n  agreement as it lacked Timmonsâ€™s signature.Â  The jury found for Pools Plus and\r\n  awarded them $8801.60.\r\nTimmons now argues the trial court erred in failing to grant a new\r\n  trial after erroneously admitting the contract into evidence.Â  â€œThe admission of evidence is a matter left to the\r\n  discretion of the trial judge and, absent clear abuse, will not be disturbed on\r\n  appeal.â€Â  Carlyle v. Tuomey Hosp., 305 S.C. 187, 193, 407 S.E.2d 630,\r\n  633 (1991).Â  Likewise, the grant or denial of a new\r\n  trial motion falls within the trial courtâ€™s discretion, and the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  decision will only be disturbed on appeal if it is controlled by an error of\r\n  law or wholly unsupported by the evidence.Â  Sabb v. South Carolina\r\n    State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).\r\nUnder\r\n  the facts of this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\r\n  admitting the contract, even though the contract lacked Timmonsâ€™s signature.Â \r\n  Our courts have held that â€œ[a] contract does not always require the signature\r\n  of both parties; it may be sufficient, if signed by one and accepted and acted\r\n  on by the other.â€Â  Jaffe v. Gibbons, 290 S.C. 468, 473, 351 S.E.2d 343,\r\n  346 (Ct. App. 1986); see also Peddler, Inc. v. Rikard, 266\r\n  S.C. 28, 32, 221 S.E.2d 115, 117 (1975).\r\nIn\r\n  her answer, Timmons admitted to entering into a contract with Pools Plus.Â  At\r\n  trial, Timmons acknowledged the contract offered into evidence, even though\r\n  unsigned by her, accurately reflected the basic terms of the contract.Â  Further,\r\n  Timmons stated she owed about $8800 on the pool.Â  Therefore, the trial court\r\n  did not abuse its discretion as evidence existed supporting the contractâ€™s\r\n  admission and no error of law was made.Â  Accordingly, a new trial was not\r\n  warranted.\r\n2.&nbsp; Timmons additionally\r\n  disputes the trial courtâ€™s award of prejudgment interest.Â  Prejudgment interest\r\n  is appropriate â€œon obligations to pay money from the\r\n  time when, either by agreement of the parties or operation of law, the payment\r\n  is demandable, if the sum is certain or capable of being reduced to certainty.â€Â  Butler Contracting, Inc. v. Court Street, LLC, 369 S.C. 121,\r\n  133, 631 S.E.2d 252, 258 (2006).Â  â€œThe right of a\r\n  party to prejudgment interest is not affected by rights of\r\n  discount or offset claimed by the opposing party. Â It is the character of the\r\n  claim and not the defense to it that determines whether prejudgment interest is\r\n  allowable.â€Â  Id. at 133-34, 631 S.E.2d at 259.\r\nAt\r\n  trial, Timmons stated, â€œI still owe the $8800.â€Â  She additionally said, â€œI\r\n  refused to pay the portion that was due until the pool was satisfactory.â€Â  Timmons\r\n  simply refused to pay as she was dissatisfied with her pool; however, Timmonsâ€™s\r\n  disappointment does not shield her from prejudgment interest.Â  Here, the amount\r\n  owed was in fact reduced to\r\n  certainty for Timmons acknowledged her remaining obligation.Â  Consequently, the\r\n  amount awarded to her was properly subject to prejudgment interest.  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the judgment of the trial court is  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral\r\n  argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-208","title":"Horton v.

Horton (Employee) is\r\n  entitled to recover workersâ€™ compensation benefits for injuries he sustained during\r\n  a motor vehicle accident that occurred while he traveled from his home in\r\n  Lancaster to Employerâ€™s job site in Columbia. Â We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  January 7, 2004, Employer hired Mark Hinson (Foreman) to supervise masons and\r\n  laborers on construction sites.Â  Employer paid Foreman $23 per hour for the hours\r\n  he worked on the job site.Â  Employer also paid Foreman a â€œtruck allowanceâ€ of\r\n  $150 per month.[2]Â \r\n  Employer authorized Foreman to hire brick masons and laborers to work on the\r\n  job sites he supervised.Â  A few weeks later, Foreman went to Employeeâ€™s home and\r\n  offered him a job with Employer.Â  Employee accepted a masonâ€™s job paying $18\r\n  per hour.[3]\r\nAfter\r\n  Employee started working for Employer, Foreman and Employee always traveled together\r\n  in Foremanâ€™s personal vehicle to and from their homes in Lancaster to job sites\r\n  in Charlotte and Columbia.Â  Employee testified he worked for Employer only on\r\n  the days he rode to job sites with Foreman.Â  In November 2004, upon Employeeâ€™s\r\n  recommendation, Foreman hired another Lancaster man, James Clark, to work as a\r\n  laborer for Employer. Â Clark testified he also worked for Employer only on days\r\n  he rode to Employerâ€™s job sites with Foreman.Â   \r\nOn the\r\n  morning of November 17, 2004, Employee, Clark, and Foreman were traveling in\r\n  Foremanâ€™s vehicle from Lancaster to a job site in Columbia. Â While driving on\r\n  Interstate 77 in Fairfield County, Foremanâ€™s car slammed into the rear of a\r\n  vehicle moving approximately twenty-five miles per hour.Â  The impact threw Employee\r\n  from the car; a helicopter transported him to Richland Memorial Hospital where he recovered until his release on December 10, 2004.[4]Â \r\n  As a result of the accident, Employee sustained injuries to his head, back,\r\n  heart, spleen, pelvis, left leg, left hip, appendix, and teeth.Â  Employee now\r\n  walks with a cane and is under the continuing care of a physician for injuries sustained\r\n  in the accident, including headaches, seizures, and an inability to control his\r\n  left foot.Â  Employee has not worked since the accident, and his physician\r\n  indicates Employeeâ€™s physical limitations will prevent him from working as a\r\n  brick mason in the future.Â   \r\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn\r\n  May 2005, Employee filed a Form 50 claiming entitlement to workersâ€™ compensation\r\n  benefits for injuries he sustained in the November 17, 2004 accident.Â  Employee\r\n  alleges his injuries are compensable because he â€œwas performing services\r\n  arising out of and in the course of employment at the time of the accident.â€Â \r\n  Employer filed a Form 51 denying Employeeâ€™s injuries were compensable. Â \r\nOn\r\n  September 8, 2005, a single commissioner conducted a hearing.Â  The commissioner\r\n  found â€œ[t]he provision of transportation to and from work was not [E]mployerâ€™s\r\n  normal company policy and testimony from [Employerâ€™s] witnesses was that\r\n  [Foreman] acted outside of general company policy in this regard.â€Â  However, the\r\n  commissioner ultimately determined:  \r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  greater weight of evidence supports that, as a condition of [Employeeâ€™s]\r\n  employment, [Foreman] provided transportation to and from work. . . .Â  [T]hrough\r\n  course of conduct and other evidence [Foreman] had actual authority to, and\r\n  did[,] negotiate these transportation terms as a condition of [Employeeâ€™s]\r\n  employment binding [Employer] to the terms of the contract with [Employee]. Evidence\r\n  of this arrangement was proven by [Employeeâ€™s] testimony that [Foreman] showed\r\n  him checks from [Employer] for transporting him. I base this finding on the\r\n  testimony of [Employee], James Clark, and Laura Noah [Employeeâ€™s mother].\r\n\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the commissioner concluded Employeeâ€™s injuries were compensable because he had\r\n  â€œproven an exception to the â€˜going and coming ruleâ€™ discussed in Byrd v.\r\n    Stackhouse Sheet Metal Works, 317 S.C. 35, 451 S.E.2d 405 (Ct. App. 1994)\r\n  since his employer provided transportation to and from job sites and said\r\n  transportation was a condition of [Employeeâ€™s] employment.â€Â  The commissioner\r\n  ordered Employer to pay Employee temporary total benefits and all of his causally-related medical\r\n  expenses.Â   \r\nFollowing a review hearing on June 28, 2006, the Commissionâ€™s\r\n  Appellate Panel (Panel) determined the commissionerâ€™s findings of fact and\r\n  rulings of law were correct and incorporated them by reference into the Panelâ€™s\r\n  ruling affirming the commissionerâ€™s order in its entirety.[5]Â  The Panel noted as â€œadditional\r\n  reasoning for the Hearing Commissionerâ€™s decisionâ€ that the Dead Manâ€™s Statute\r\n  did not apply because Employeeâ€™s witnesses were not testifying against a\r\n  survivor of the now-deceased Foreman.Â  The Panel also (1) ruled Foreman had\r\n  â€œeither actual authority or apparent authority to both hire [Employee] and\r\n  provide transportationâ€ and (2) overruled Employerâ€™s hearsay objections under\r\n  Rule 801(d)(2) of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence.  \r\nFollowing a hearing on January 4, 2007, the circuit court,\r\n  applying the substantial evidence standard of review, found the Panel did not\r\n  err in finding Employeeâ€™s case fell within an exception to the going and coming\r\n  rule because testimony in the record could â€œreasonably be viewed as\r\n  establishing [Employee] had been hired by a supervisor [Hinson] who was driving\r\n  the automobile in which [Employee] was injured at the time of the accident when\r\n  [Foreman] had actual and/or apparent authority to hire [Employee] and negotiate\r\n  the terms of his employment, including the provision of transportation to and\r\n  from the job site, especially in light of the fact that [Employee] did not have\r\n  a driverâ€™s license.â€Â  Additionally, the circuit court affirmed the Panelâ€™s\r\n  conclusion that testimony regarding Foremanâ€™s statements to Employee was properly\r\n  admitted because the statements were neither hearsay nor barred by the Dead\r\n  Manâ€™s Statute.Â  The circuit court affirmed the Panelâ€™s order in its entirety.Â \r\n  This appeal followed.  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  Administrative Procedures Act governs judicial review of all non-jurisdictional\r\n  decisions of the workersâ€™ compensation commission. Â Gray v. Club Group, Ltd.,\r\n  339 S.C. 173, 182, 528 S.E.2d 435, 440 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œThe [reviewing] court\r\n  may not substitute its judgment for the judgment of the agency as to the weight\r\n  of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  The court may affirm the decision of the\r\n  agency or remand the case for further proceedings.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  1-23-380(A)(5) (Supp. 2006).Â  However, the reviewing court\r\n\r\n\tmay\r\n  reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been\r\n  prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or\r\n  decisions are: (a) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (b)\r\n  in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; (c) made upon unlawful\r\n  procedure; (d) affected by other error of law; (e) clearly erroneous in view of\r\n  the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record, or (f)\r\n  arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly\r\n  unwarranted exercise of discretion. \r\n\r\nId.Â  This court will set aside a decision by the workersâ€™\r\n  compensation commission only where the determination is unsupported by â€œsubstantial\r\n  evidence.â€ Â Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981). Â Substantial\r\n  evidence is evidence that, considering the record as a whole, would allow\r\n  reasonable minds to reach the conclusion reached by the Appellate Panel.Â  Rodney\r\n    v. Michelin Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 515, 466 S.E.2d 357 (1996).Â  The\r\n  possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not\r\n  mean the agencyâ€™s conclusion is unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  Ellis\r\n    v. Spartan Mills, 276 S.C. 216, 277 S.E.2d 590 (1981).Â   \r\nâ€œConversely,\r\n  where the [Panelâ€™s] s decision is controlled by an error of law, this courtâ€™s\r\n  review is plenary.â€Â  Lizee v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Mental Health, 367 S.C. 122,\r\n  126, 623 S.E.2d 860, 862 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  An appellate court may reverse the Panel\r\n  when its decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Callahan v. Beaufort County Sch. Dist., 375 S.C. 92, 651 S.E.2d 311 (2007).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Actual or Apparent Authority \r\nEmployer\r\n  argues Employeeâ€™s injuries are not compensable because Employer did not\r\n  authorize Foreman to offer Employee transportation to and from work.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nAn\r\n  employee may recover workersâ€™ compensation benefits for injuries sustained by an\r\n  accident â€œarising out of and in the course of employment.â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  42-1-160 (Supp. 2006).Â  Generally, injuries an employee sustains while traveling\r\n  to and from the workplace are not compensable.Â Eadie\r\n    v. H.A. Sack Co., 322 S.C. 164, 168, 470 S.E.2d 397, 399 (Ct. App. 1996); see\r\n      also Gray v. Club Group, Ltd., 339 S.C. 173, 188, 528 S.E.2d 435,\r\n  443 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œAs a general rule, an employee going to or coming from the place\r\n  where his work is to be performed is not engaged in performing any service\r\n  growing out of and incidental to his employment, and, therefore, an injury\r\n  sustained by accident at such time does not arise out of and in the course of\r\n  his employment.â€). Â Â \r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina recognizes five exceptions to the going and coming rule: 1)\r\n  the employer provides the means of transportation or pays travel time; 2) the\r\n  employee performs duties during his commute; 3) the route used is inherently\r\n  dangerous; 4) the place where the injury occurs is in such close proximity to\r\n  the workplace that it is brought within the scope of employment; and 5) the\r\n  injury occurs while the employee is on a special errand for the employer.Â  Eadie,\r\n  322 S.C. at 168-69, 470 S.E.2d at 400.Â   \r\nHere,\r\n  Employeeâ€™s injuries are compensable, under an exception to the going and coming\r\n  rule, only if substantial evidence supports the Panelâ€™s finding that Employer\r\n  either (1) provided the means of Employeeâ€™s transportation, or (2) paid\r\n  Employee for his travel time to and from work.Â  Employeeâ€™s own testimony\r\n  confirmed Employer did not pay for his travel time to and from the job site.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  Employeeâ€™s injuries will be compensable only if substantial evidence supports\r\n  the Panelâ€™s finding that Employer, through its agent, Foreman, provided\r\n  the means of Employeeâ€™s transportation to work.Â   \r\nAn\r\n  agency relationship may be established by evidence of actual or apparent\r\n  authority.Â  R &amp; G Const., Inc. v. Lowcountry Regâ€™l Transp. Auth.,\r\n  343 S.C. 424, 432, 540 S.E.2d 113, 117 (Ct. App. 2000).Â Â  In a principal -\r\n  agent relationship, â€œapparent authority is considered to be a power which a principal\r\n  holds his agent out as possessing or permits him to exercise under such\r\n  circumstances as to preclude a denial of its existence.â€ Â Id. at 433,\r\n  540 S.E.2d at 118.Â   \r\n\r\n\tWhen a\r\n  principal, by any such acts or conduct, has knowingly caused or permitted\r\n  another to appear to be his agent, either generally or for a particular\r\n  purpose, he will be estopped to deny such agency to the injury of third persons\r\n  who have in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable prudence dealt with\r\n  the agent on the faith of such appearances. Â The apparent authority of an agent results from conduct or\r\n  other manifestations of the principalâ€™s consent, whereby third persons are\r\n  justified in believing the agent is acting within his authority. Â Such\r\n  authority is implied where the principal passively permits the agent to appear\r\n  to a third person to have the authority to act on his behalf.\r\n\r\nId. at 433-34, 540 S.E.2d at 118 (citations omitted).Â  â€œThe\r\n  doctrine of apparent authority provides that a principal may be bound by the acts of its agent when the\r\n  principal has placed the agent in a position such that third parties are\r\n  reasonably led to believe the agent has certain authority and they in turn deal\r\n  with the agent in reliance on this manifestation.â€ Â Eadie, 322 S.C. at 171,\r\n  470 S.E.2d at 401. Â \r\nIn Eadie,\r\n  H.A. Sack employed Harold Eadie to supervise its construction projects, paid\r\n  him a mileage allowance to drive his personal vehicle to and from work, and authorized\r\n  him to hire crew members.Â  Id. at 167, 470 S.E.2d at 399.Â  Eadie hired Don\r\n  Stanley to work with him on a Hilton Head project.Â  Eadie and Stanley both\r\n  lived in Hampton and routinely rode to work together.Â  Later, Eadie hired Phillip\r\n  Nix, also from Hampton, and offered him rides to Hilton Head with Eadie and\r\n  Stanley.Â  Eadie testified he offered transportation to Stanley and Nix as an\r\n  inducement to accept a job with H.A. Sack.Â  Id. at 170, 470 S.E.2d at 400.Â \r\n  On their way to work, Eadie, Stanley, and Nix were involved in an automobile\r\n  accident.Â   \r\nH.A.\r\n  Sack argued the Panel erred in finding Stanleyâ€™s and Nixâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation\r\n  claims were compensable under an exception to the going and coming rule.Â  Id. at 168, 470 S.E.2d at 399.Â  H.A. Sack conceded it provided transportation for\r\n  Eadie; however, H.A. Sack alleged Stanleyâ€™s and Nixâ€™s injuries were not\r\n  compensable because â€œEadie lacked authority to obligate the company to pay\r\n  transportation costs for his crew.â€Â  Id. at 170, 470 S.E.2d at 400.Â  Our\r\n  court affirmed the Panel, finding Eadie had apparent authority\r\n  to offer transportation to Stanley and Nix on behalf of H.A. Sack and this\r\n  authority was binding upon H.A. Sack.Â  Id. at 171, 470 S.E.2d at 401.Â  \r\n \r\nHere,\r\n  as in Eadie, Employee testified regarding the circumstances under which\r\n  he was hired: â€œ[Foreman] c[a]me to the house and asked me if I needed a job,\r\n  and I told him I didnâ€™t have a way back and forth, and [Foreman] said the\r\n  company would provide transportation.â€Â  Employee stated Foreman picked him up\r\n  at home and drove him to and from job sites in Charlotte and Columbia.Â \r\n  Employee testified he only went to work when Foreman went to work and if\r\n  Foreman had to stay home, Employee stayed home as well.Â  Employee also\r\n  testified Foreman showed him a check for $150 that Foreman said Employer was paying\r\n  him to transport Employee to work in Foremanâ€™s personal vehicle.Â   \r\nLaura\r\n  Noah, Employeeâ€™s mother, testified to being present when Foreman offered a job\r\n  to Employee.Â  She testified she asked Foreman: â€œ[h]ow is [Employee] going to\r\n  get back and forth to Charlotte and Columbia with no car and no driverâ€™s\r\n  license?â€Â  She also testified Foreman answered: â€œPyramid Masonry was going to\r\n  furnish transportation for [Employee] back and forth to work.â€ Â Â \r\nDavid\r\n  Mauney, a regional vice president with Employer for twenty-four years,\r\n  testified Employer does not provide transportation to its employees and that it\r\n  is the employeeâ€™s â€œresponsibility to find [his] own way to work.â€Â  He stated Employerâ€™s\r\n  job description for a mason specifically states the employee â€œmust have means\r\n  of transportation to and from project.â€Â  However, Employee testified he had not\r\n  seen the job description prior to the hearing.Â  When asked whether Foreman\r\n  could have told Employee that Employer would provide his transportation to\r\n  work, Mauney responded: â€œThat would have been outside the scope of his\r\n  authority.â€Â   \r\nMauney\r\n  testified Employer gave each of its foremen a truck allowance of $150 per month\r\n  for using their personal vehicles â€œduring the course of the workday on the job\r\n  site, and if they have to go pick up incidentals, such as ice or gasoline or\r\n  small tools . . . .â€Â  Mauney testified Employerâ€™s written policy for the truck\r\n  allowance had not changed since 1989.Â  The policy states: â€œThis pertains only\r\n  for picking up or delivering incidentals and not to be interpreted as mileage.â€[6]Â \r\n  Mauney stated Foreman began receiving the truck allowance on the day he began\r\n  work; however, the allowance did not change when Foreman began transporting\r\n  Employee a few weeks later, or several months later, when Foreman hired Clark\r\n  and began transporting him to the job sites as well.[7]Â \r\n  Â Â Â \r\nIt\r\n  is uncontested that Employer hired Foreman to supervise its construction\r\n  projects in Charlotte and Columbia.Â  It is also not disputed that Employer gave\r\n  Foreman actual authority to hire masons and laborers to work on these projects.Â \r\n  Employer testified it expressly authorized Foreman to offer an hourly wage to\r\n  the crew members he hired.Â  Employee testified that only Foreman, on behalf of\r\n  Employer, discussed the terms of his employment with him.Â  Employeeâ€™s mother\r\n  testified she was present and heard Foreman tell Employee that Employer would\r\n  provide transportation to and from the job sites.Â  Accordingly, we find Employee\r\n  and his mother could have reasonably believed that Foreman, as Employerâ€™s\r\n  agent, had the authority to negotiate all of the terms of employment, including\r\n  Employerâ€™s provision of Employeeâ€™s transportation to work.[8]Â   \r\nEmployer\r\n  argues the facts in Eadie distinguish it from the facts of this case\r\n  because in Eadie, the employer paid Eadie a mileage allowance for his\r\n  travel to and from work.Â  We find this distinction to be unpersuasive. Â The Eadie court affirmed that Stanleyâ€™s and Nixâ€™s injuries were compensable because substantial\r\n  evidence in the record supported its finding that H.A. Sack had â€œplaced Eadie\r\n  in a position impliedly manifesting his authority to dictate the employment termsâ€\r\n  to the crew members he hired. Â The courtâ€™s decision turned on its finding that\r\n  Eadie acted with actual or apparent authority when he offered crew members transportation\r\n  to and from work.Â  That authority bound H.A. Sack to the terms Eadie negotiated\r\n  with the crew members.  \r\nHere,\r\n  there is evidence to support the Commissionâ€™s decision that Employerâ€™s agent,\r\n  Foreman, acting with actual or apparent authority, told Employee that Employer\r\n  would provide transportation as a condition of his employment.Â  While Foremanâ€™s\r\n  offer of transportation may have exceeded the scope of the actual authority\r\n  Employer conferred upon him, there is sufficient evidence in the record to\r\n  support Employeeâ€™s belief that Foreman had apparent authority to negotiate the\r\n  terms of his employment, including Employerâ€™s provision of transportation.Â \r\n  Employer is bound by Foremanâ€™s representations to Employee concerning the\r\n  conditions of his employment.Â  Accordingly, the Commissionâ€™s decision that Employeeâ€™s\r\n  injuries are compensable because they fall within an established exception to\r\n  the going and coming rule is supported by substantial evidence and is therefore\r\n  affirmed.Â   \r\nII.&nbsp; Admission By Party Opponent\r\nEmployer additionally\r\n  argues testimony regarding Foremanâ€™s alleged statements to Employee concerning\r\n  the conditions of his employment offer constituted inadmissible hearsay.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nWhile\r\n  relied upon by the Panel and the circuit court, the South Carolina Rules of\r\n  Evidence do not apply in proceedings before the Workersâ€™ Compensation\r\n  Commission. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-330(1) (2005). Â We further note that great\r\n  liberality is exercised in permitting the introduction of evidence in proceedings\r\n  under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  See Hamilton v. Bob Bennett\r\n    Ford, 339 S.C. 68, 70, 528 S.E.2d 667, 668 (2000) (citing Ham v. Mullins\r\n      Lumber Co., 193 S.C. 66, 7 S.E.2d 712 (1940)).Â  Â Accordingly, hearsay\r\n  testimony may be admissible if corroborated by facts, circumstances, or other\r\n  evidence.Â  Hamilton, 339 S.C. at 70, 528 S.E.2d at 668. Â We find\r\n  sufficient facts and circumstances in the record to support a finding of\r\n  corroboration. Â It is undisputed that Employer and Foreman were in an employer-employee\r\n  relationship when Foreman offered Employee a job with Employer.Â  It is also\r\n  undisputed that Employer had authorized Foreman to hire masons and laborers to\r\n  work at job sites Foreman supervised.Â  The record contains not only testimony\r\n  from Employee about his inability to drive and the circumstances surrounding\r\n  his offer of employment, but also testimony from Employeeâ€™s mother who stated\r\n  she was present at the time the statements by Employerâ€™s agent were made.[9]\r\nThus,\r\n  we find the record contains sufficient evidence from which the Commission and\r\n  the circuit court properly considered the statements by Employeeâ€™s agent.[10]Â Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, the decision of the circuit court is  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., PIEPER, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Employer testified it provides a monthly truck\r\n  allowance to each of its foremen.Â  Employerâ€™s written policy states the truck\r\n  allowance is for â€œthe intended use of reimbursement for the use of personal\r\n  vehicles on the job site.Â  This pertains only for picking up or delivering\r\n  incidentals and not to be interpreted as mileage.â€Â   \r\n[3] Foreman and Employee lived in Lancaster and had\r\n  known each other for many years prior to Foreman offering Employee a job with\r\n  Employer.Â  Employee testified he had worked for ten to fifteen years with\r\n  Foreman in Foremanâ€™s fatherâ€™s construction company.Â  Later, Foreman started his\r\n  own business, and Employee worked for him.Â  Employee did not have a car or a\r\n  driverâ€™s license the entire time he worked for Foremanâ€™s family.Â  Consequently,\r\n  Foreman or Foremanâ€™s father drove Employee to and from the job sites during the\r\n  ten to fifteen year period that preceded Employerâ€™s hiring of Employee in\r\n  January 2004. Â \r\n[4] Foreman died from the injuries he sustained in\r\n  the accident.Â   \r\n[5] Two Panel members voted to affirm the commissionerâ€™s\r\n  ruling and one member voted to reverse.Â   \r\n[6] Mauney pointed out that if viewed as a mileage\r\n  allowance, Employerâ€™s truck allowance of $150 a month would only cover a few\r\n  days of travel.Â   \r\n[7] Donald Williams, a foreman with Employer for eighteen\r\n  years, testified he also received a $150 truck allowance from Employer; however,\r\n  he had never taken employees to work in his vehicle.Â  When asked if Employer\r\n  provides transportation to employees to the job site, Williams responded:\r\n  â€œNo.â€Â  Williams testified Employer provided the truck allowance â€œfor\r\n  miscellaneous on-the-job, getting ice or anything pertaining to the job.â€Â Â  \r\n \r\n[8] â€œIf the servant is doing some act in furtherance of\r\n  the masterâ€™s business, he will be regarded as acting within the scope of his\r\n  employment, although he may exceed his authority.â€Â  Crittenden v.\r\n    Thompson-Walker Co., Inc., 288 S.C. 112, 116, 341 S.E.2d 385, 388 (Ct. App.\r\n  1986).\r\n[9] We accept for purposes of argument by Employer that\r\n  the statements were hearsay and have considered whether the Panel erred in the\r\n  admission of this evidence outside of the Rules of Evidence.Â  If Rule 801(d)(2)\r\n  is considered only by analogy, we think the evidence would clearly qualify as\r\n  non-hearsay and would be admissible as an admission by party-opponent.\r\n[10] While asserted before the Commission, neither party\r\n  addressed S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 19-11-20 (Supp. 2006) [the Dead Manâ€™s Statute] on\r\n  appeal to this court and that issue is, therefore, deemed abandoned.Â  Rule\r\n  208(b)(1)(B), SCACR;Â  See Hampton v.

Brailsford and Charles H. McDonald, of Columbia, for\r\n  Appellants-Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\tThomas Elihue Dudley, III, of Greenville, for\r\n  Respondent-Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This\r\n  case arises out of a construction contract between Richland-Lexington Riverbanks Park District\r\n  (â€œRiverbanksâ€) and Plowden Construction Company, Inc. (â€œPlowdenâ€) for Plowden\r\n  to build a road for Riverbanks.Â  During construction, Plowden encountered\r\n  excess rock and brought the underlying action against Riverbanks and the\r\n  project engineer, the LPA Group, Inc., (â€œLPAâ€).Â  Riverbanks and LPA appeal the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s ruling for Plowden, and Plowden cross-appeals for prejudgment\r\n  interest on its award.Â  We\r\n  affirm.[1]\r\n1.&nbsp; Riverbanks hired LPA to assist with the construction\r\n  of a new entrance from Highway 378 to the Riverbanks Zoo and Botanical Gardens\r\n  in Columbia.Â  LPA designed the entrance, prepared bid packages and contract\r\n  documents for prospective contractors, and acted as Riverbanksâ€™ representative\r\n  during construction.Â  Initially, the bid packages were â€œunclassifiedâ€ with\r\n  regard to the amount of rock excavation that would be encountered on the job.[2]Â \r\n  However, the packages were changed to reflect an estimate of 1,000 cubic yards of\r\n  rock to be excavated.Â  At a pre-bid meeting, potential bidders were assured by\r\n  LPA that if the encountered rock became a huge problem, they were â€œmore than\r\n  willing to worth with [the bidders].â€\r\nPlowden\r\n  was ultimately awarded the job.Â  Soon after construction began, Plowden\r\n  encountered bedrock, which required blasting in order to be removed.Â  Plowden\r\n  proceeded with the work, but eventually the amount and size of rocks being\r\n  excavated began to interfere with the project.Â  The rocks became too large and numerous\r\n  to leave at the construction site, and Plowden finally halted construction on\r\n  the project.Â  This resulted in a delay while a location to deposit the rocks\r\n  was sought by LPA.\r\nPursuant\r\n  to a provision in the contract, Plowden sought a change in the contract price\r\n  to reflect the quality and quantity of rock removal associated with the\r\n  project.Â  The project manager denied the requested changes finding the contract\r\n  indicated quantities were approximate, Plowden was responsible for examining\r\n  the physical conditions of the property before bidding, and the work stoppage\r\n  was unnecessary.Â  Plowden brought the underlying action against Riverbanks and\r\n  LPA.Â  The trial court found Riverbanks and LPA jointly and severally liable for\r\n  $225,270.17, the cost of the additional work, and $66,000 in delay costs.Â \r\n  Riverbanks and LPA appeal the trial courtâ€™s ruling, and Plowden cross-appealed\r\n  for prejudgment interest.\r\n2.&nbsp; LPA argues the trial\r\n  court erred in finding LPA liable when LPA lacked privity in the contract\r\n  between Riverbanks and Plowden and LPA followed the standard of care for design\r\n  professionals.Â  The trial court found LPA liable for breaching its duty to\r\n  follow the standard of care of design professionals.Â  In Tommy L. Griffin\r\n    Plumbing &amp; Heating Co. v. Jordan, Jones &amp; Â Goulding, Inc.,\r\n  320 S.C. 49, 55, 463 S.E.2d 85, 88-89 (1995), the South Carolina Supreme Court\r\n  held an engineer who designed the project and supervised construction owed a\r\n  duty to the contractor not to design or to supervise the project negligently because\r\n  design professionals owe a professional duty, which is separate from\r\n  contractual duties.Â  Therefore, LPAâ€™s liability is grounded in negligence, not\r\n  contract principles.Â  Accordingly, LPAâ€™s privity to Riverbanks and Plowdenâ€™s\r\n  contract is irrelevant.\r\nNext,\r\n  we turn to whether evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s finding LPA violated its\r\n  professional duty.Â  â€œIn an action at law, when a case is tried without a jury,\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s findings of fact will be upheld on appeal when they are\r\n  reasonably supported by the evidence.â€Â  Butler Contracting, Inc. v.\r\n    Court St., LLC, 369 S.C. 121, 127, 631 S.E.2d 252, 255 (2006).Â  â€œWhere\r\n  professional negligence is alleged, expert testimony is usually necessary to\r\n  establish both the standard of care and the professionalâ€™s deviation from that\r\n  standard, unless the subject matter is within the area of common knowledge and\r\n  experience of the layman so that no special learning is needed to evaluate the\r\n  professionalâ€™s conduct.â€Â  City of York v. Turner-Murphy Co., Inc., 317\r\n  S.C. 194, 196, 452 S.E.2d 615, 617 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\nAt\r\n  trial, Herman Snyder, qualified as an expert in road construction in South Carolina, testified it is within industry standards for a contractor to rely on\r\n  geotechnical information when preparing bids and it is the designerâ€™s\r\n  responsibility to reflect accurately the anticipated scope of work in its\r\n  report to assist the bidder.\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Carroll Crowther was qualified as an expert in geotechnical engineering and\r\n  construction consulting.Â  Crowther testified the normal practice in the\r\n  construction industry is to rely on geotechnical reports when computing bids.Â \r\n  Crowther further testified the method used by LPA to produce its report was\r\n  superficial and required a â€œleap of faithâ€ for the report to provide information\r\n  regarding the locationâ€™s rock profile.Â  Lastly, Crowther testified LPAâ€™s\r\n  actions only minimally reduced the risk of a contractor encountering unknown\r\n  situations.\r\nSnyder\r\n  and Crowther established a basis for the factfinder to conclude that the standard\r\n  in the industry is for a design professional to provide reasonably accurate\r\n  estimates, because it is the norm for bidders to rely on the provided\r\n  information.Â  Furthermore, Crowtherâ€™s testimony clearly intimates that LPA was\r\n  negligent in providing bidders with only superficial information about the rock\r\n  associated with the project.Â  Consequently, the record supports the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s finding of professional negligence on the part of LPA.\r\n3.&nbsp; Riverbanks and LPA\r\n  allege Plowden expressly or primary impliedly assumed the risk the unit price\r\n  for rock excavation was inadequate.Â  â€œExpress assumption of risk applies when\r\n  the parties expressly agree in advance, either in writing or orally, that the\r\n  plaintiff will relieve the defendant of his or her legal duty toward the\r\n  plaintiff.â€Â  Davenport v. Cotton Hope Plantation Horizontal Prop.\r\n    Regime, 333 S.C. 71, 79, 508 S.E.2d 565, 569 (1998).Â  Whereas, primary\r\n  implied assumption of risk focuses on the defendantâ€™s duty of care and whether\r\n  the plaintiff impliedly assumed risks inherent in the specific activity.Â  Id. at 81, 508 S.E.2d at 570.\r\nRiverbanks\r\n  and LPA point to areas in the contract where the bid scheduleâ€™s quantity of\r\n  work is described as approximate and the contractor represents to have studied\r\n  all reports on the site.Â  Section 11.9.3 in the contract undermines Riverbanks\r\n  and LPAâ€™s argument as it provides:\r\n\r\n\tWhere\r\n  the quantity of any item of Unit Price Work performed by CONTRACTOR differs materially\r\n    and significantly from the estimated quantity of such item indicated in the\r\n  Agreement and there is no corresponding adjustment with respect to any other\r\n  item of Work and if CONTRACTOR believes the CONTRACTOR has incurred additional\r\n  expense as a result thereof, CONTRACTOR may make a claim for an increase in the\r\n  Contract Price in accordance with Article 11 if the parties are unable to agree\r\n  as to the amount of any such increase. \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Therefore,\r\n  any risk Plowden assumed did not rise to the level of assuming responsibility\r\n  for a rock quantity materially and significantly differing from the provided\r\n  estimate.Â  Given the drastic difference between the estimated quantity of rock\r\n  and the amount Plowden encountered, the trial courtâ€™s reliance on section\r\n  11.9.3 was clearly justified.Â  Further, as discussed above, Plowden established\r\n  LPA owed Plowden a duty of care.Â  Accordingly, there is evidence to support the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s rejection of this defense.\r\n4.&nbsp; Riverbanks and LPA\r\n  appeal the trial courtâ€™s finding that the no-damage-for-delay provision in the\r\n  contract was not enforceable.Â  â€œGenerally,\r\n  no-damage-for-delay provisions are valid and enforceable so long as they meet\r\n  ordinary rules governing the validity of contracts.â€Â  U.S. for Use and\r\n    Benefit of Williams Elec. Co., Inc. v. Metric Constructors, Inc., 325 S.C. 129,\r\n  132, 480 S.E.2d 447, 448 (1997).Â  South Carolina recognizes several exceptions\r\n  to this general rule, including â€œdelay caused by fraud, misrepresentation, or\r\n  other bad faith; active interference; delay which amounts to an abandonment of\r\n  the contract; and gross negligence.â€Â  Id. at 137, 480 S.E.2d at 451.\r\nThe\r\n  trial court found the no-damage-for-delay clause unenforceable due to active\r\n  interference and gross negligence by LPA, while acting as Riverbanksâ€™\r\n  representative, in failing to locate a site to move the excess rocks.Â  In\r\n  August 2000, Plowden informed LPA the rock estimation had already doubled and\r\n  requested LPA provide a location where Plowden could deposit the excess rock.Â \r\n  The record includes a chronology and many letters where Plowden repeatedly asked\r\n  for a rock disposal location because the lack of such a site slowed the\r\n  projectâ€™s progress and eventually caused construction to cease.Â  During this\r\n  time, LPA repeatedly claimed to be working on finding a site.Â  LPA took\r\n  approximately three months to locate a site.\r\nBecause\r\n  there is evidence in the record which supports the trial courtâ€™s decision, we\r\n  are constrained by our standard of review to affirm the trial courtâ€™s holding\r\n  that the no-damage-for-delay clause was not enforceable.\r\n5.&nbsp; Riverbanks and LPA next argue the trial court erred in\r\n  calculating the damages awarded Plowden because of lack of proof of damages and\r\n  the damages exceeded the original unit price for the non-excessive quantities\r\n  of rock.Â  Plowden provided evidence of the additional costs created, which the\r\n  trial court adopted less the money previously paid Plowden.Â  This evidence\r\n  reasonably supports the trial courtâ€™s award.Â  As previously discussed, section\r\n  11.9.3 of the contract provided for Plowden to seek an increase in the contract\r\n  price if â€œthe quantity of any item of Unit Price Work performed by CONTRACTOR\r\n  differs materially and significantly from the estimated quantity of such item\r\n  indicated in the Agreement.â€Â  Plowden established the quantity of rock differed\r\n  materially and significantly warranting adjusted compensation.Â  Thus, no error\r\n  occurred when the trial court awarded Plowden $225,270.17 for the cost of the\r\n  additional work.\r\n6.&nbsp; Finally, Plowden\r\n  cross-appeals seeking prejudgment interest.Â  â€œ[P]rejudgment\r\n  interest is allowed on a claim of liquidated damages; i.e., the sum is certain\r\n  or capable of being reduced to certainty based on a mathematical calculation previously agreed to by the parties.\r\n  Prejudgment interest is not allowed on an unliquidated claim in the absence of\r\n  an agreement or statute.â€Â  Butler Contracting, Inc. v. Court\r\n    Street, LLC, 369 S.C. 121, 133, 631 S.E.2d 252, 258-59 (2006)).Â  Plowden\r\n  seeks prejudgment interest on the increased cost of work.Â  As discussed above,\r\n  the contract set forth a process for Plowden to recover the increased cost if\r\n  the amount of work materially and significantly differed from the estimated\r\n  work.Â  This allowance of an adjustment in contract\r\n  price speaks to the uncertainty regarding the nature and extent of work\r\n  contemplated by the contract.Â  See Vaughn Dev., Inc. v. Westvaco Dev.\r\n    Corp., 372 S.C. 576, 580-81, 642 S.E.2d 757, 760-61 (Ct. App. 2007)\r\n  (declining to award prejudgment interest where the extent of work on sewer\r\n  installation or how the work would be accomplished was not dictated by the\r\n  terms of the contract).Â  The contract did not set forth a formula to determine\r\n  such an adjustment.Â  Therefore, Plowdenâ€™s damages were not capable of being\r\n  reduced to certainty until the determination by the trial court.Â  The trial\r\n  court properly declined to award prejudgment interest.\r\n7.&nbsp; We\r\n  conclude the record reasonably supports the trial courtâ€™s findings LPA breached\r\n  its standard of care as a design professional; Plowden did not assume the risk\r\n  of the rock removalâ€™s increased costs; the no-damage-for-delay provision was\r\n  unenforceable; and the damage award was proper.Â  Further, the trial court\r\n  properly declined to award prejudgment interest.Â  Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is\r\n \r\n&nbsp;AFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Unclassified generally means the contractor is\r\n  responsible for excavating whatever rock is encountered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-210","title":"Aunt and Uncle v.

Elliott, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Aunt\r\n  and Uncle appeal from the family courtâ€™s order, which (1) denied their petition\r\n  to terminate the parental rights of Mother and Father, (2) granted Mother\r\n  additional and more extensive visitation with Child, and (3) required Aunt and\r\n  Uncle to pay Fatherâ€™s and Childâ€™s guardian ad litem (GAL) fees. Â We affirm in\r\n  part, reverse in part, and remand.  \r\nFACTS\r\nShortly after Childâ€™s birth on March 3,\r\n  2002, Father was hospitalized due to a drug overdose.Â  Thereafter, Mother and\r\n  Father (collectively Parents) tested positive for cocaine, and the Department\r\n  of Social Services (DSS) placed Child with her maternal grandmother\r\n  (Grandmother).Â  DSS also imposed a safety plan which prohibited Parents from any\r\n  unsupervised contact with Child.Â  After Parents violated the safety plan, law\r\n  enforcement removed Child from Grandmotherâ€™s custody and took her into\r\n  emergency protective custody (EPC).Â  On April 25, 2002, DSS placed Child in foster\r\n  care.Â   \r\nAt a removal merits hearing on May 30, 2002, the family court found\r\n  Child was â€œan abused and/or neglected child as defined in [South Carolina Code\r\n  Annotated section] 20-7-490 (Supp. 1997). Â The nature of the harm to the child\r\n  is threat of harm of physical neglect by [Mother and Father] based on their\r\n  positive drug screen for cocaine.â€Â  The family court ratified a consent order\r\n  for removal and a placement plan, which granted legal custody of Child to DSS.Â \r\n  The family court also required Parents to attend bi-weekly supervised visits\r\n  with Child and to each pay $50 per month in child support.Â Â Â  Further, it\r\n  ordered Parents to participate in a drug assessment program, submit to random\r\n  drug tests, and attend family counseling to address past instances of criminal\r\n  domestic violence.Â  Additionally, the family court required Father to attend parenting\r\n  and anger management classes. Â Parents agreed\r\n  to comply with the placement plan and were notified their failure to accomplish\r\n  the planâ€™s objectives within the specified time frame could result in the loss\r\n  of their parental rights.[2]Â  \r\n \r\nOn May 29, 2003, after Child resided in foster care for one year, the\r\n  family court conducted a permanency planning hearing to review the progress of Parents.Â \r\n  The family court found the following: (1) Mother had recently tested positive\r\n  for illegal substance abuse; (2) Father had failed to comply with the placement\r\n  plan; and (3) Parents were in arrears on their child support payments.Â   \r\nBased on these findings, the family court accepted DSSâ€™s recommendation\r\n  that custody of Child be granted to Aunt and Uncle.[3] Â Under a consent order filed May 29,\r\n  2003, the family court awarded legal and physical custody of Child to Aunt and\r\n  Uncle, granted Parents supervised visits with Child, and ordered Parents to pay\r\n  past-due child support.Â  The family courtâ€™s order stated reunification of Child\r\n  with Parents was no longer a goal.Â  The family court informed Parents they must\r\n  successfully complete the original, court-approved placement plan before\r\n  petitioning the family court for Childâ€™s return.Â  Because Child had been\r\n  successfully placed with relatives, DSS closed the case; however, DSS retained a\r\n  right to intervene in the future. Â \r\nDuring the next twelve months, Mother and Father divorced, Father\r\n  was incarcerated in federal prison, and Mother was arrested for public\r\n  intoxication and reckless driving. Â In July 2004, Aunt and Uncle filed a petition\r\n  seeking termination of Parentsâ€™ parental rights.[4]Â \r\n  Aunt and Uncle additionally requested the suspension of Motherâ€™s visitation\r\n  privileges should the family court decline to terminate her parental rights. Subsequent\r\n  to the filing of the petition, Mother was indicted and pled guilty to charges\r\n  of possession of cocaine.Â Â Â   \r\nA termination of parental rights (TPR) hearing was conducted on June\r\n  27 and 30, 2006.Â  Aunt and Uncle testified Child had lived with them for the\r\n  past three years, and they hoped to adopt Child following the termination of Parentsâ€™\r\n  parental rights.Â  No petition for adoption had been filed prior to the TPR\r\n  hearing.Â  Childâ€™s GAL, Gregory Harlow (Harlow), testified Mother had not\r\n  responded to his attempts to contact her.Â  Harlow stated termination of\r\n  Motherâ€™s and Fatherâ€™s parental rights was in Childâ€™s best interest.Â  However, the\r\n  family court found Aunt and Uncle failed to prove a statutory ground for the\r\n  termination of Parentsâ€™ parental rights by clear and convincing evidence and\r\n  denied Aunt and Uncleâ€™s petition.Â  The family court also granted Mother additional\r\n  and more extensive visitation with Child and ordered Aunt and Uncle to pay\r\n  Fatherâ€™s and Childâ€™s GAL fees. Â The family court subsequently denied Aunt and\r\n  Uncleâ€™s post-judgment motion to amend findings of fact and conclusions of law.Â  This appeal follows. \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  grounds for TPR must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. Â S.C. Depâ€™t\r\n    of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œUpon review, the appellate court may make its own finding from the record\r\n  as to whether clear and convincing evidence supports the termination [of\r\n  parental rights].â€Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 609,\r\n  582 S.E.2d 419, 423 (2003).Â   \r\nâ€œOn\r\n  appeal from the family court, this [C]ourt has jurisdiction to correct errors\r\n  of law and find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of\r\n  the evidence.â€Â  Henggeler v. Hanson, 333 S.C. 598, 601, 510 S.E.2d 722,\r\n  724 (Ct. App. 1998). Â â€œA preponderance of the evidence stated in simple\r\n  language, is that evidence which convinces as to its truth.â€ Â Frazier v.\r\n    Frazier, 228 S.C. 149, 168, 89 S.E.2d 225, 235 (1955) (internal quotations\r\n  omitted). Despite this broad scope of review, this Court is not required to\r\n  disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Doe v. Roe, 369 S.C. 351, 359,\r\n  631 S.E.2d 317, 321 (Ct. App. 2006). Â This Court remains mindful the family\r\n  court saw and heard the witnesses, placing it in a better position to evaluate\r\n  the credibility and assign comparative weight to each witnessâ€™ testimony.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Statutory Grounds for TPR\r\nAunt\r\n  and Uncle first argue the family court erred in finding there was insufficient evidence to support a statutory\r\n  ground for termination of Parentsâ€™ parental rights.Â  We disagree in regards to Motherâ€™s parental rights but\r\n  agree in regards to Fatherâ€™s parental rights.\r\nThe\r\n  procedures for TPR are governed by statute.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-1560\r\n  to -1582 (Supp. 2007).Â  The family court may order TPR upon a finding of one or\r\n  more of the eleven statutory grounds listed in the TPR statute and upon a\r\n  finding that termination is in the best interest of the child.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-7-1572. Â Therefore, Â \r\n\r\n\tto\r\n  terminate parental rights under section 20-7-1572, the family court must first\r\n  find at least one of the statutory grounds set forth in that section.Â  If the\r\n  family court finds that a statutory ground for termination has been proven, it\r\n  must then find that the best interests of the child would be served by\r\n  termination.Â  \r\n\r\nDoe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 580, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct.

Rivas v. Rivas, 342 S.C.\r\n  102, 107, 536 S.E.2d 372, 374 (2000).Â  However, due process prohibits the\r\n  termination of parental rights on a ground for which the parent did not receive\r\n  notice.Â  Greenville County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Bowes,\r\n  313 S.C. 188, 195, 437 S.E.2d 107, 111 (1993), superseded by statute,\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572, as recognized in Hooper v. Rockwell,\r\n  334 S.C. 281, 296 n.6, 513 S.E.2d 358, 366 n.6 (1999) (recognizing a family\r\n  court must, in addition to finding a statutory ground for TPR has been proven\r\n  by clear and convincing evidence, make the additional finding that termination\r\n  is in the best interest of the child).Â   \r\nAunt\r\n  and Uncleâ€™s failure to raise section 20-7-1572(1) in their appeal resulted in\r\n  Mother having no notice that her parental rights could be terminated pursuant\r\n  to that statutory ground.Â  The issues on appeal failed to advise Mother she\r\n  would be called upon to address the possible applicability of section\r\n  20-7-1572(1), and therefore, she was deprived of an opportunity to rebut any\r\n  allegations concerning this statutory ground.Â  Therefore, due process prevents\r\n  us from terminating Motherâ€™s parental rights pursuant to section 20-7-1572(1).Â  Id. Â See also Blanton v. Stathos, 351 S.C. 534, 542, 570\r\n  S.E.2d 565, 569 (Ct.

Dodson, 240 S.C. 532, 539,\r\n  126 S.E.2d 564, 567 (1962) (finding issues were deemed abandoned when party\r\n  failed to argue the issues in their brief).Â  Thus, we affirm the family court\r\n  and do not terminate Motherâ€™s parental rights pursuant to section\r\n  20-7-1572(1).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   \r\nAs\r\n  previously stated, Aunt and Uncleâ€™s appeal presents an entirely different\r\n  statutory ground as a basis for terminating Motherâ€™s parental rights.Â  Aunt and\r\n  Uncle claim Motherâ€™s parental rights should be terminated based on section\r\n  20-7-1572(2), which allows for TPR when more than six months have passed since\r\n  the childâ€™s removal from the parentâ€™s home, and the parent has failed to remedy\r\n  the condition which led to the childâ€™s removal.Â  This statutory ground was\r\n  never pled or raised by Aunt and Uncle as a reason for terminating Motherâ€™s\r\n  parental rights; rather, Aunt and Uncle raised this ground solely as a basis\r\n  for terminating Fatherâ€™s parental rights.Â  Having never been raised, the family\r\n  court did not have an opportunity to rule on this issue as a ground for\r\n  terminating Motherâ€™s parental rights.Â  Thus, under the standard appellate court\r\n  rules, it would be improper for this Court to consider whether section\r\n  20-7-1572(2) may be employed to terminate Motherâ€™s parental rights. Â See Rule 210(c), SCACR (â€œThe Record [on Appeal] shall not . . . include matter\r\n  which was not presented to the lower court or tribunal.â€).Â  See also Elam\r\n    v. S.C.

Depâ€™t Soc. Servs. v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 52, 413 S.E.2d 835, 838 (1992).\r\nChild has lived\r\n  outside of Motherâ€™s home for more than six months, and Mother has not visited\r\n  Child in over two years.Â  The issue, however, is whether this failure to visit\r\n  was willful when evidence indicates that Aunt and Uncle frustrated Motherâ€™s\r\n  attempts to visit Child.Â   \r\nAunt and Uncle presented\r\n  evidence indicating when Child was in DSS custody, Mother missed almost no\r\n  scheduled visitations with Child despite transportation problems she faced.Â \r\n  Additional testimony was presented which showed that although Mother was well-educated, she did not\r\n  object to or request a change in visitation arrangements by contacting DSS, the\r\n  attorneys who represented her during her divorce, or Childâ€™s GAL.Â  Aunt and\r\n  Uncle argue these facts provide evidence that Motherâ€™s recent failure to visit\r\n  was willful.Â   \r\nMother, however, presented conflicting testimony regarding the\r\n  reasons she failed to regularly visit Child after Aunt and Uncle were granted\r\n  custody.Â  Mother alleged her efforts to\r\n  visit Child were thwarted by Aunt and Uncle.Â  Mother testified Aunt refused to\r\n  let Mother have anyone accompany her to the visitations despite Mother\r\n  requiring transportation from family or friends in order to make it to the\r\n  visitations.Â  Mother also stated Aunt and Uncle scheduled visits only in the\r\n  middle of work days, which made the visitations more difficult to attend.Â \r\n  Further, Mother said Aunt told her not to call Aunt and Uncleâ€™s home or she\r\n  would be arrested for harassment.Â  Â Â Finally, Aunt contacted law enforcement to\r\n  inform them about Motherâ€™s whereabouts which led to Motherâ€™s arrest at a\r\n  visitation for a missed child support payment.Â Â Â   \r\nAt\r\n  the end of all the testimony, the family court noted there was evidence to\r\n  suggest Aunt and Uncle in some ways tried to discourage visitation between\r\n  Mother and Child, while also recognizing Mother had not done all she could have\r\n  to assert her visitation rights.Â  The family court additionally stated although\r\n  parties may believe very strongly in their positions, when parties try a case, the\r\n  evidence presented in the courtroom is what matters and not what the parties\r\n  know in their hearts.Â  We recognize that much of the findings the family court\r\n  made in this case had to be determined from its observations of the witnesses\r\n  and the credibility it accorded them, and we, therefore, give deference to those\r\n  findings.Â  See Roe, 369 S.C. at 359, 631 S.E.2d at 321 (stating\r\n  the appellate courts must not ignore the fact that the trial judge saw and\r\n  heard the witnesses and was in a better position to evaluate their credibility\r\n  and assign comparative weight to their testimony).\r\nWe\r\n  find the record contains evidence which supports Motherâ€™s claim that her\r\n  efforts to visit Child were frustrated by Aunt and Uncle.Â  With no clear and\r\n  convincing evidence showing Mother willfully failed to visit Child, Motherâ€™s\r\n  parental rights will not be terminated pursuant to section 20-7-1572(3).Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\tb.&nbsp;Termination of Fatherâ€™s\r\n  Parental Rights\r\n\t\r\n\t\ti.&nbsp;Fatherâ€™s Failure to Remedy\r\n  Conditions\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAunt\r\n  and Uncle begin their argument for the termination of Fatherâ€™s parental rights\r\n  based on section 20-7-1572(2), arguing Father has failed to remedy the\r\n  conditions which led to Childâ€™s removal from Parentsâ€™ home more than six months\r\n  ago.Â  Aunt and Uncle argue the record contains clear and convincing evidence to\r\n  support this claim.Â  We agree.Â   \r\nParentsâ€™\r\n  positive drug tests and failure to comply with the DSS safety plan were the\r\n  conditions which led to Childâ€™s removal from Parentâ€™s home.Â  In the family\r\n  courtâ€™s order finding the evidence was insufficient to support a statutory ground\r\n  for TPR, the court stated: â€œThere is no showing that [Father] continues to use\r\n  drugs or alcohol while incarcerated.Â  There is no showing as to whether or not\r\n  [F]ather has had any opportunity to remedy the conditions leading to the\r\n  removal of the child.â€Â Â Â   \r\nAs previously stated, section 20-7-1572(2) allows for a parentâ€™s\r\n  rights to be terminated if six months have passed since the childâ€™s removal\r\n  from the parentâ€™s home and the parent has failed to remedy the condition which\r\n  led to that removal.Â  TPR based on the statutory ground of failure to remedy\r\n  conditions â€œdoes not suggest that an attempt to remedy alone is adequate\r\n  to preserve parental rights. Â Otherwise, the statute would be couched in such\r\n  terms.Â  The attempt must have, in fact, remedied the conditions.â€Â  Depâ€™t of\r\n    Soc. Servs. v. Phillips, 365 S.C. 572, 579, 618 S.E.2d 922, 925 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005) (emphasis in original) (citation omitted).Â  Furthermore, the statute makes no mention of a parent having an\r\n  opportunity to remedy the condition; the statute simply focuses on whether the\r\n  condition has in fact been remedied by the parent.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-7-1572(2) (stating a ground for termination is found if â€œchild has been\r\n  removed from the parent . . . , has been out of the home for a period of six\r\n  months . . . , and the parent has not remedied the conditions which caused the\r\n  removalâ€). Â Evidence presented failed to show Father had remedied the\r\n  conditions which caused Childâ€™s removal.Â  Â \r\nWhen\r\n  the TPR hearing was held, Father was in federal prison following a conviction\r\n  for being a felon in possession of a firearm[7] in January 2004.Â  Although absent from the hearing, Father was represented by\r\n  an attorney and had a GAL appointed to represent his interests.Â  At the\r\n  hearing, Aunt and Uncle presented evidence which indicated Father continued to\r\n  abuse drugs up to the time of his incarceration.Â  The family courtâ€™s consent\r\n  order from the permanency planning hearing indicated Father refused to participate in drug\r\n  screenings, assessment, and counseling ordered by the family court.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Aunt and Uncle presented letters from Father to Aunt as recently as April 2006\r\n  where he admitted feeling â€œso much better that [he was] not doped up every 10\r\n  minutes.â€Â  The only evidence presented in\r\n  Fatherâ€™s favor was his GALâ€™s\r\n  testimony that Father was attempting to obtain drug treatment in prison in\r\n  order to â€œget his sentence reduced.â€Â  Â Â \r\nAfter a review of the record, we reverse the family court and find\r\n  clear and convincing evidence to support the termination of Fatherâ€™s parental\r\n  rights pursuant to section 20-7-1572(2).Â  Â \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fatherâ€™s Willful Failure to\r\n  Visit\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAunt\r\n  and Uncle next argue Fatherâ€™s parental rights should be terminated due to\r\n  Fatherâ€™s willful failure to visit Child pursuant to section 20-7-1572(3).Â  Aunt\r\n  and Uncle claim the record provides clear and convincing evidence of Fatherâ€™s\r\n  willful failure to visit.Â  We agree.Â Â   \r\nParental\r\n  rights may be terminated for a parentâ€™s willful failure to visit a child who\r\n  has been removed from the parentâ€™s home for more than six months, but it must be\r\n  shown the parent was not prevented from visiting the child.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-7-1572(3).Â  The willfulness of a parentâ€™s failure to visit will be a\r\n  fact-specific inquiry, but it is well established that a parentâ€™s incarceration\r\n  alone is not sufficient to establish a willful failure to visit.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t\r\n    of Soc. Servs. v. Wilson, 344 S.C. 332, 340, 543 S.E.2d 580, 584 (Ct. App.\r\n  2001).Â  While a parentâ€™s voluntary pursuit of lawless behavior may be\r\n  considered by the family court, â€œ[t]erminating the parental rights of an\r\n  incarcerated parent requires consideration of all of the surrounding facts and\r\n  circumstances in the determination of wilfulness.â€Â  Id.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nFather\r\n  failed to visit Child regularly during the thirteen months she was in foster\r\n  care, and he had no contact with her during a seven-month interval prior to his\r\n  incarceration.Â  When asked if it was fair to say Father did not have much of a\r\n  relationship with Child prior to his incarceration, Fatherâ€™s GAL responded: â€œI\r\n  think thatâ€™s probably fair to say.â€Â  Accordingly, Fatherâ€™s incarceration since January 2004\r\n  does not explain his failure to visit Child for the seven months that preceded\r\n  his incarceration or his failure to attempt contact during the thirteen months\r\n  Child was in foster care. Â \r\nThese facts and circumstances, in addition to Fatherâ€™s deliberate\r\n  choice to engage in behavior which would result in his incarceration,\r\n  demonstrate Fatherâ€™s willful failure to visit Child.Â  We find clear and\r\n  convincing evidence supports termination of Fatherâ€™s parental rights on the\r\n  statutory ground of his willful failure to visit Child, and therefore, we\r\n  reverse the family court on this issue.Â  Â \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tiii.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatherâ€™s Willful Failure to\r\n  Support\r\n\t\r\n\r\nFinally,\r\n  Aunt and Uncle argue Fatherâ€™s parental rights should be terminated for Fatherâ€™s\r\n  willful failure to support Child when Child has been outside of Fatherâ€™s home\r\n  for more than six months.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(4).Â  We find this issue\r\n  is not preserved for our review.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  their complaint, Aunt and Uncle sought to terminate Fatherâ€™s parental rights\r\n  based on his willful failure to support Child.Â  The family court, however, made\r\n  no finding regarding this issue. Â Following the family courtâ€™s ruling, Aunt and\r\n  Uncle made a post-judgment motion to amend findings of fact and conclusions of\r\n  law and/or to make new findings and conclusions, but they never requested the\r\n  family court to rule on Fatherâ€™s willful failure to support Child.Â  â€œPost-trial\r\n  motions to amend or modify judgment are necessary to preserve issues that have\r\n  been raised to the trial court but not ruled upon.â€Â  Sims v. Hall, 357\r\n  S.C. 288, 299, 592 S.E.2d 315, 321 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Accordingly, the issue of\r\n  whether Father willfully failed to support Child is not properly before this\r\n  Court.Â Â Â   \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Best Interest of Child\r\nAs\r\n  previously stated, parental rights may only be terminated upon a finding of at\r\n  least one of the statutory grounds listed in section 20-7-1572 and a finding\r\n  that termination is in the childâ€™s best interest.Â  Baby Boy Roe, 353\r\n  S.C. at 580, 578 S.E.2d at 735.Â  Â Â \r\nAunt\r\n  and Uncle provided insufficient evidence to terminate Motherâ€™s parental rights\r\n  under section 20-7-1572 of South Carolinaâ€™s TPR Statute.Â  Finding Aunt and\r\n  Uncle failed to establish any statutory ground for the termination of Motherâ€™s\r\n  parental rights, we do not reach the issue of whether termination of Motherâ€™s\r\n  parental rights is in Childâ€™s best interest.Â  See id. (stating\r\n  only after a statutory ground for termination of parental rights has been found\r\n  must the family court question whether termination is in the childâ€™s best\r\n  interest).Â Â Â   \r\nAunt and Uncle, however, did provide clear and convincing evidence\r\n  to support the termination of Fatherâ€™s parental rights pursuant to sections\r\n  20-7-1572(2) and (3), and therefore, we must consider whether the termination\r\n  of his parental rights is in Childâ€™s best interest.Â  See id. (stating parental rights may be terminated upon a finding of at least one\r\n  statutory ground and a finding that termination is in the childâ€™s best\r\n  interest).Â  The family court never reached this issue.Â  We, therefore, remand\r\n  the issue to the family court to take any additional testimony if necessary to\r\n  make a determination of whether Childâ€™s best interests are served by terminating\r\n  Fatherâ€™s parental rights and to set forth its findings with particularity.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant of Visitation to\r\n  Mother\r\nAunt and Uncle argue the family court erred in ordering additional\r\n  and more extensive visitation between Mother and Child.Â  We agree in part.Â  \r\n \r\nAs discussed above, the record contains sufficient evidence to\r\n  indicate Aunt and Uncle have frustrated Motherâ€™s right to visit Child.Â  Therefore,\r\n  the family court was correct to award Mother greater access to Child, and thus,\r\n  we affirm in part the order of visitation.Â   \r\nThe record, however, does not contain testimony or other\r\n  sufficient evidence on which to base a determination about a visitation\r\n  schedule that would be in Childâ€™s best interest. Â There was no discussion about\r\n  the appropriate amount of visitation Mother should be granted, the length of\r\n  time these visitations should last, and whether these visitations should be\r\n  supervised, and if so, by whom.Â  A thorough investigation should be conducted\r\n  by a GAL to establish an appropriate visitation schedule for Mother, which\r\n  should also include regular drug testing of Mother.Â   \r\nDue to the lack of evidence regarding a visitation schedule that\r\n  would be in Childâ€™s best interest, we reverse the visitation schedule ordered\r\n  by the family court and remand the issue to the family court to determine an\r\n  appropriate, structured, and gradual visitation schedule.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIV.&nbsp;Award of GAL Fees\r\nAunt and Uncle argue the family court\r\n  erred by ordering them to pay Fatherâ€™s and Childâ€™s GAL fees of $5,817.50.Â  We disagree. Â \r\nAunt and Uncle failed to provide any authority in support of their\r\n  argument, making it a conclusory argument, and an issue which is not supported by authority is deemed abandoned on\r\n  appeal.Â  See Mulherin-Howell v. Cobb, 362 S.C. 588, 600, 608\r\n  S.E.2d 587, 593-94 (Ct. App. 2005) (finding party abandoned an issue due to\r\n  failure to cite any supporting authority and making only conclusory\r\n  statements). Â We add that the award of GAL fees lies within the sound\r\n  discretion of the family court judge and will not be disturbed on appeal,\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion. Â Shirley v. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324,\r\n  341, 536 S.E.2d 427, 436 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Because Aunt and Uncleâ€™s argument is\r\n  conclusory and we find no abuse of discretion, we affirm the family courtâ€™s\r\n  order regarding GAL fees.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we affirm the family courtâ€™s finding that clear and\r\n  convincing evidence does not support the termination of Motherâ€™s parental\r\n  rights pursuant to section 20-7-1572.Â  Furthermore, we reverse the family\r\n  courtâ€™s findings that clear and convincing evidence does not support the\r\n  termination of Fatherâ€™s parental rights pursuant to sections 20-7-1572(2) and\r\n  (3).Â  Additionally, we remand the issue of whether termination of Fatherâ€™s\r\n  parental rights is in Childâ€™s best interest.Â  We also affirm the family courtâ€™s\r\n  grant of increased visitation to Mother, but we reverse the ordered visitation\r\n  schedule.Â  We remand this issue to the family court to modify the visitation\r\n  schedule pursuant to this opinion.Â  Finally, we affirm the family courtâ€™s award\r\n  of GAL fees.Â   \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the family courtâ€™s decision is\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nWILLIAMS\r\n  and PIEPER, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â Â  \r\n\r\n[1] The names of the parties and the minor child have\r\n  been changed to protect the minor childâ€™s identity.Â Â   \r\n[2] The placement plan also included a visitation\r\n  contract, which stated Parents were to attend bi-weekly supervised visits with\r\n  Child and failure to comply with the visitation schedule could affect their\r\n  parental rights.Â   \r\n[3] On\r\n  May 5, 2003, DSS transferred Child out of foster care and placed her with Aunt,\r\n  who is Fatherâ€™s half-sister, and Uncle. Â Aunt and Uncle have been married for twenty-one years and have no other children.Â  Â Uncle has worked at Kimberly-Clark for the past\r\n  fourteen years, and Aunt does not work outside the home.Â   \r\n[4] Aunt and Uncleâ€™s complaint sought\r\n  termination of Motherâ€™s parental rights based upon it being reasonably unlikely\r\n  Mother could make her home safe for Child within twelve months, Motherâ€™s\r\n  failure to consistently visit Child, and Motherâ€™s failure to consistently pay\r\n  child support.Â  Aunt and Uncleâ€™s complaint sought termination of Fatherâ€™s\r\n  parental rights â€œbased upon his failure to visit, failure to pay child support,\r\n  failure to remedy the condition which made removal of the minor child necessary[,]\r\n  and failure to keep his home safe for his daughter within . . . twelve (12)\r\n  months.â€  \r\n[5] We note, â€œRule 2(a), SCRFC, specifically excludes\r\n  Rule 50, SCRCP (directed verdict motions), from family court proceedings.â€Â  Owens\r\n    v. Owens, 320 S.C. 543, 544 n.1, 466 S.E.2d 373, 374 n.1 (Ct. App. 1996).Â \r\n  Therefore, Motherâ€™s motion was at most a motion for involuntary nonsuit\r\n  pursuant to Rule 41(b), SCRCP, which is not excluded by Rule 2(a), SCRFC.Â  See id.

Cleary, South Carolina Commission,\r\n  of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney\r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott,\r\n  Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., Office of the Attorney\r\n  General, of Columbia; and Solicitor Donald V. Myers, of Lexington, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Joshua\r\n  Gordon (Gordon) appeals his conviction for trafficking in crack cocaine and\r\n  resisting arrest.Â  On appeal, Gordon argues the trial court erred in admitting\r\n  into evidence crack cocaine seized at the time of his arrest because the State\r\n  failed to establish a complete chain of custody.Â  We affirm.Â Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nInvestigator\r\n  Roosevelt Young (Young) of the Edgefield County Sheriffâ€™s Department arrested\r\n  Gordon pursuant to an arrest warrant. Subsequent to the arrest, Young took\r\n  possession of a substance believed to be crack cocaine from Gordonâ€™s mouth and\r\n  pocket.Â  The items recovered from Gordon were placed in a â€œbest kitâ€ along with\r\n  a form detailing all pertinent information.[1]Â \r\n  A best kit is a tamper evident[2] plastic bag, in which evidence\r\n  obtained from a crime scene is placed.  \r\nAfter\r\n  the evidence was placed within the best kit, Investigator Warren Miller sealed\r\n  the best kit.Â  According to Agent Nathan McCoy\r\n  (McCoy), a chemical analyst in the field of drug analysis for SLED, once\r\n  sealed the best kit could not be opened without tearing it.Â  Thus, it would be\r\n  apparent if an individual attempted to tamper with the best kit.Â   \r\nAfter\r\n  Gordonâ€™s arrest, Young transported the best kit from the crime scene to an\r\n  evidence safe in Youngâ€™s office.Â  From there, Young hand-delivered the best kit\r\n  to the SLED Drug Identification Unit in Columbia.Â  Young testified the best kit\r\n  and its contents were not changed or altered, and no one else had access to it\r\n  from the time when the kit was sealed at the crime scene to when it was\r\n  delivered to Columbia.Â  Upon arriving at SLED, Young gave the kit to a SLED\r\n  administrative employee so the evidence could be logged into SLEDâ€™s computer.Â \r\n  The employee returned the kit back to Young, and Young placed the kit into the\r\n  evidence box.\r\nMcCoy testified he subsequently retrieved the kit from the\r\n  evidence box.Â  After performing an inspection of the best kit, McCoy concluded no one had tampered with the best kit.Â  McCoy also determined the seal was intact.Â  After breaking\r\n  the seal, McCoy performed chemical tests on the contents of the best kit and\r\n  concluded the substance in the best kit was crack cocaine.Â   \r\nGordon objected to McCoyâ€™s testimony regarding the substance to be\r\n  crack cocaine, arguing the State failed to prove the chain of custody of the best\r\n  kit because the administrative employee was not identified.Â  The trial court\r\n  denied this objection and allowed the evidence to come in at trial.Â  Consequently,\r\n  Gordon was convicted of trafficking in crack cocaine and resisting arrest and\r\n  sentenced to twenty-five years for the trafficking charge and one year for the\r\n  resisting arrest charge.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe admission of evidence rests in the sound discretion of the\r\n  trial court.Â  State v. Johnson, 318 S.C. 194, 196, 456 S.E.2d 442, 443\r\n  (Ct. App. 1995).Â  The trial courtâ€™s decision will not be overturned unless\r\n  controlled by an error law resulting in undue prejudice.Â  Id.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe sole issue on appeal is whether the State established a\r\n  complete chain of custody of the best kit.Â  Specifically, Gordon contends the\r\n  testimony of everyone who handled the evidence, including that of the administrative employee who received the best kit to\r\n  log it into SLEDâ€™s computer, was necessary to establish the chain of custody.Â \r\n  We disagree.  \r\nÂ If a party wishes to offer into evidence fungible items such as\r\n  drug samples, that party must establish a chain of custody as far as\r\n  practicable.Â  State v. Taylor, 360 S.C. 18, 22-23, 598 S.E.2d 735, 737\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004).Â  If the analyzed substance has passed through several hands,\r\n  the evidence must not leave it to conjecture as to who had it and what was done\r\n  with it between the taking of the evidence and its analysis.Â  Id.Â  However,\r\n  the proof of chain of custody need not negate all possibility of tampering; rather,\r\n  it must establish a complete chain of evidence as far as practicable.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nIn the present case, there is sufficient evidence to conclude the\r\n  trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling the State had established a\r\n  complete chain of custody of the best kit.Â  Young testified he took the crack\r\n  cocaine from Gordonâ€™s person and placed it in the best kit.Â  Miller testified\r\n  that the best kit was thereafter sealed.Â  Young then locked the best kit in an\r\n  evidence locker and later transported the best kit to SLED.Â  Young testified the best kit was neither changed nor\r\n  altered from the time the kit was sealed at the crime scene and brought to SLED.\r\nYoung hand-delivered the best kit to an administrative employee who received the best kit to\r\n  log it into SLEDâ€™s computer.Â  Young then personally placed the best kit in the\r\n  evidence box.Â  McCoy testified he retrieved the kit\r\n  from the evidence box.Â  McCoy also stated the\r\n  best kit had not been tampered with and the seal was intact.Â  The\r\n  foregoing testimony clearly demonstrates the State established a chain of\r\n  custody of the crack cocaine seized from Gordon until it was analyzed by McCoy.Â \r\n  We do not find the Stateâ€™s failure to produce the administrative employee to\r\n  testify fatal.Â  See S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cochran, 364\r\n  S.C. 621, 629-30, 614 S.E.2d 642, 646-47 (1995) (holding every individual\r\n  associated with the evidence need not be identified nor be available to testify\r\n  in order to establish a chain of custody and affirming the family courtâ€™s\r\n  determination that a chain of custody of blood samples had been established\r\n  even though the identity of the courier who transported the samples from the\r\n  collection site to the testing facility was unknown when samples arrived at the\r\n  testing facility sealed and intact).Â Â  Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s decision is  \r\nAFFIRMED.[3] \r\nHUFF,\r\n  KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] According to testimony, this information includes: a\r\n  control number used throughout the chain of custody, the name of the suspect\r\n  from which the evidence was retrieved, a description of the contents recovered,\r\n  and the name of the law enforcement officer who recovered the evidence.Â  \r\n \r\n[2] Tamper evident means that if the best kit has been\r\n  tampered with, for example, by a person attempting to gain access to the bag,\r\n  the kit will show signs of tampering.Â   \r\n[3] We decide this case without oral arguments pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
