Rushton, III and Reginald C.

(Venture) failure to properly file the amended complaint.Â  We reverse and\r\n  remand.[1]  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 2002, the Averys, through their company\r\n  Myrtle Beach Developers, LLC, purchased a tract of land in South Carolina.Â  The\r\n  Averys hired Venture to perform engineering and consulting services in\r\n  connection with the property.Â  After Venture provided the services, the Averys\r\n  failed to pay Venture monies due under the contract.Â   \r\nOn\r\n  December 4, 2002, Venture brought suit against the Averys, alleging breach of\r\n  contract, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, fraud, and\r\n  quantum meruit.Â  The Averys, who at this point were represented by counsel,\r\n  timely answered.Â   \r\nIn 2004, Venture moved to compel discovery\r\n  and requested leave to file an amended complaint.Â  Attached to the motion for\r\n  leave to file an amended complaint was the amended complaint, which was\r\n  file stamped on July 16, 2004.Â  In addition, the Averysâ€™ counsel moved to be\r\n  relieved.Â   \r\nDuring\r\n  a hearing, the circuit court considered and granted all three motions.Â  The\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s order gave the Averys thirty days to obtain new counsel, if\r\n  they desired.Â  Otherwise, the order provided Venture should mail all documents\r\n  to the Averysâ€™ address in North Carolina.Â  The circuit court ordered the Averys\r\n  to notify the court, in writing, of any change of address.Â   \r\nOn July\r\n  21, 2005, Venture mailed the summons and amended complaint to the Averys.Â  The\r\n  amended complaint was virtually identical to the first except it added a cause\r\n  of action for piercing the corporate veil.Â  However, Venture failed to file the\r\n  amended complaint.Â  The Averys, who were pro se, did not respond\r\n  to the amended complaint.Â   \r\nDue to\r\n  the Averysâ€™ failure to answer the amended complaint, Venture filed an affidavit\r\n  of default.Â  The affidavit erroneously provided the amended complaint was filed\r\n  on July 15, 2005.Â  The circuit court referred the matter to the\r\n  master-in-equity for damages to be assessed, and Venture notified the Averys of\r\n  the reference to the master.Â   \r\nAt the damages hearing, which the Averys\r\n  did not attend, Steve PowellÂ  testified on behalf of Venture.Â  Powell testified\r\n  that the Averys owed Venture $79,000 for services rendered.Â  Further, Powell\r\n  testified he aided the Averys in obtaining bids for selling timber and they\r\n  received over $150,000 but failed to pay Venture.Â  Powell stated he felt misled\r\n  because he was unaware that Darrell Avery was in bankruptcy, and both Averys\r\n  had served time in federal prison for the preparation of false and fraudulent\r\n  tax returns.Â  Following Powellâ€™s testimony, Venture argued it was entitled to\r\n  prejudgment interest as well as punitive damages.Â  Venture alleged the Averysâ€™\r\n  dealings with Venture were not out of the ordinary, and the Averys â€œ[took] all\r\n  the dirt, the sand, and the timber [off of the property] and let everyone else\r\n  foreclose on them, and [the Averys] go back to North Carolina [and] file\r\n  bankruptcy.â€Â  Ultimately, the master awarded damages and prejudgment interest\r\n  totaling $104,680.36 and punitive damages in the amount of $395,787.50.Â \r\n \r\nThe Averys, now represented by counsel,\r\n  moved pursuant to Rules 59 and 60, SCRCP, for a new trial and to have the\r\n  default judgment set aside.Â  At the hearing, the Averys argued, inter alia,\r\n  the judgment against them was void because Venture failed to properly file the\r\n  amended complaint.Â  Venture conceded the amended complaint was not filed but\r\n  argued the motion for leave to amend the complaint had the amended complaint\r\n  attached.Â  The circuit court agreed with Venture that it did not need to refile\r\n  the amended complaint.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court denied the Averysâ€™\r\n  motions.Â  Subsequent to the order of default and judgment, Venture filed the\r\n  amended complaint.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  determination of whether to set aside a default judgment lies within the sound\r\n  discretion of the trial court.Â  Wham v. Shearson Lehman Bros. Inc., 298 S.C. 462, 465, 381 S.E.2d 499, 501 (Ct. App.\r\n  1989).Â  The decision of the trial court â€œwill\r\n  not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Thompson\r\n    v. Hammond, 299 S.C. 116, 119, 382 S.E.2d 900, 902-03 (1989).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court\r\n  â€œissuing the order was controlled by some error of law or when the order, based\r\n  upon factual, as distinguished from legal conclusions, is without evidentiary\r\n  support.â€Â  In re Estate of Weeks, 329 S.C. 251, 259, 495 S.E.2d\r\n  454, 459 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe issue on appeal is whether Ventureâ€™s failure to properly\r\n  file the amended complaint rendered the default judgment against the Averys\r\n  void.Â  For the reasons set forth below, we find the circuit court erred by\r\n  failing to set aside the default judgment.Â  Accordingly, we reverse and\r\n  remand.Â   \r\nRule 55(a), SCRCP, provides, â€œWhen a party against\r\n  whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or\r\n  otherwise defend as provided by these rulesâ€ the clerk of court, after proper\r\n  notification, will enter default.Â Â  It is axiomatic that in order for a party\r\n  to â€œplead or otherwise defendâ€ an action, the action must be properly filed.Â \r\n  In South Carolina, a civil action is commenced if the summons and\r\n  complaint are filed with the clerk of court and proper service is effectuated.Â  See Rule 3(a), SCRCP (â€œA civil action is commenced when the summons and\r\n  complaint are filed with the clerk of court if [the summons and complaint] are\r\n  [properly served].â€).Â Â  Further, the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure\r\n  require the summons and complaint â€œbe filed before service.â€Â  Rule 5(d),\r\n  SCRCP.Â Â  See McLain v. Ingram, 314 S.C. 359, 360, 444 S.E.2d 512,\r\n  513 (1994) (finding action was not properly commenced when service preceded\r\n  filing).  \r\nIn the present\r\n  case, Venture filed the original summons and complaint and then properly served\r\n  the Averys, who timely answered.Â Â  After obtaining permission from the circuit\r\n  court to amend the complaint, Venture served the summons and amended complaint\r\n  before filing.Â  Due to the Averysâ€™ failure to answer the amended complaint,\r\n  Venture sought and obtained a default judgment.Â   \r\nVenture maintains\r\n  the rule requiring filing before service applies to only the original\r\n  pleadings, and the amended complaint falls under the â€œall papersâ€ category\r\n  under Rule 5(d), which provides, â€œ[a]ll papers required to be served upon a\r\n  party . . . shall be filed with the court within five days after service.â€Â \r\n  Therefore, Venture reasons under Rule 5(d) filing the amended complaint after\r\n  service to the Averys was proper.Â  However, the amended complaint was not filed\r\n  within five days but belatedly filed on May 17, 2006 after the entry of a\r\n  judgment.\r\nHere,\r\n  Venture would have been unable to obtain a default judgment against the Averys\r\n  on the original complaint because the Averys timely answered.Â  The only way the\r\n  Averys could be held in default would be for their failure to answer the\r\n  amended complaint.Â  Therefore, the amended complaint must have been properly\r\n  filed and served in order to trigger the Averysâ€™ duty to answer. See Rule\r\n  5(d).Â  By holding otherwise we would, in essence, allow a litigant to obtain a\r\n  default judgment against a party who failed to answer despite the fact no amended\r\n  action was pending at the court house.Â  Accordingly, we find the circuit court\r\n  erred by failing to set aside the default judgment.Â Â Â   \r\nThe Averys also\r\n  argue the circuit court erred in affirming the masterâ€™s award of prejudgment\r\n  interest.Â  Further, they allege the award of punitive damages violates their\r\n  constitutional rights.Â  Due to the resolution of this case, we decline to\r\n  address the Averysâ€™ remaining arguments.Â  See Â Futch\r\n    v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d\r\n    591, 598 (1999) (ruling an appellate court need not review remaining issues when disposition of prior issues are dispositive ).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nHUFF and PIEPER, JJ., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-003","title":"Combs v.

Lydon, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This\r\n  is an appeal from the denial of Appellantâ€™s motion to set aside the judgment of\r\n  foreclosure pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4), SCRCP.Â  She maintains the Master-in-Equity in Kershaw County did not have subject matter jurisdiction.Â  We affirm.\r\n \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1983, the parties deeded their ownership in\r\n  property located in Kershaw County, South Carolina, to Diablita, Inc., a\r\n  corporation controlled by Appellant.Â  Prior to being married in 1987, the\r\n  parties signed an antenuptial agreement in which Respondent conveyed any\r\n  ownership he had in Diablita to Appellant, making her the sole owner of the\r\n  corporation.Â  Additionally, the agreement provided all property individually\r\n  owned by either Appellant or Respondent, whether acquired before marriage or\r\n  during the marriage, would remain the property of the individual with title to\r\n  the property.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  1992, Diablita gave Ely Place Nominees, LTD., a promissory note and mortgage on\r\n  the Kershaw County property in exchange for a loan of $300,000.Â  Respondent\r\n  testified Ely Place held money on his behalf and made the loan at his\r\n  direction.Â  He indicated the money loaned to Diablita were his personal funds.Â \r\n \r\nAppellant\r\n  filed for divorce in 1997 in Florida and did not list the debt Diablita owed to Ely Place.Â  In addition,\r\n  Appellant never raised the issue of the debt during the divorce proceedings.Â \r\n \r\nAppellant\r\n  sought to obtain a loan on the property in 1999 and realized the mortgage and\r\n  note to Ely Place were still outstanding.Â  She brought suit in Kershaw County, seeking to have the mortgage and note declared null and void due to fraud.Â \r\n  The trial court dismissed the case due to the expiration of the applicable\r\n  statute of limitations.Â  Appellant filed an appeal to this court, which\r\n  affirmed the dismissal in Diablita, Inc. v. Ely Place Nominees, Op. No.\r\n  2001-UP-517 (S.C. Ct. App. filed November 27, 2001).\r\nPrior\r\n  to the divorce hearing, Diablita deeded the property to Appellant individually.\r\n  Â The Final Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage was entered in Florida in 2000.Â \r\n  The divorce decree awarded possession of the Kershaw County property to\r\n  Appellant but did not address the indebtedness in any manner.Â  Additionally,\r\n  the divorce decree affirmed the antenuptial agreement signed by the parties and\r\n  stated that any personal items not specifically addressed by the decree shall\r\n  be the property of the party in possession and control of the item.Â   \r\nIn 2002, Ely Place assigned the note and mortgage to Respondent.Â \r\n  He commenced this action for foreclosure in 2003.Â  Prior to the hearing on the\r\n  action in 2005, Appellant moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  The Master denied the motion.Â  The Master later issued a\r\n  Masterâ€™s Report and Judgment of Foreclosure and Sale without mentioning the\r\n  jurisdictional issue.Â   \r\nAppellant filed an appeal from the denial of her motion to\r\n  dismiss.Â  The appeal was dismissed by this court as interlocutory and not\r\n  immediately appealable.Â  Appellant then filed a motion pursuant to Rule\r\n  60(b)(4), SCRCP, seeking an order setting aside the judgment and sale for lack\r\n  of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  The Master denied the motion and this appeal\r\n  followed.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhether to grant or\r\n  deny a motion under Rule 60(b), SCRCP, is within the sound discretion of the\r\n  judge.Â  Coleman v. Dunlap, 306 S.C. 491, 494, 413 S.E.2d 15, 17 (1992).Â \r\n  Our standard of review, therefore, is limited to determining whether the Master\r\n  committed an abuse of discretion.Â  BB&amp;T v. Taylor, 369 S.C. 548,\r\n  551, 633 S.E.2d 501, 502-03 (2006).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the\r\n  judge issuing the order was controlled by an error of law or the order is based\r\n  on factual conclusions that are without evidentiary support.Â  Tri-County Ice\r\n    &amp; Fuel Co. v. Palmetto Ice Co., 303 S.C. 237, 242, 399 S.E.2d 779, 782\r\n  (1990).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellant maintains\r\n  the Master erred in ruling he had subject matter jurisdiction to hear the\r\n  foreclosure action.Â  She contends the Florida Family Court that heard the\r\n  divorce action retained exclusive jurisdiction over the parties and their\r\n  property.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œSubject\r\n  matter jurisdiction refers to the courtâ€™s â€˜power to hear and determine cases of\r\n  the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.â€™â€Â  Watson v.\r\n    Watson, 319 S.C. 92, 93, 460 S.E.2d 394, 395 (1995) (quoting Dove v.\r\n      Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 237-38, 442 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1994)).Â  The\r\n  Master-in-Equity is considered a division of the circuit court and obtains\r\n  jurisdiction through an order of reference from the circuit court.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-11-15 (Supp. 2006); Rule 53, SCRCP.Â  A master would then\r\n  have subject matter jurisdiction over a properly referred foreclosure action.Â  See Wachovia Bank of South Carolina, N.A. v. Player, 341 S.C. 424, 427, 535\r\n  S.E.2d 128, 129 (2000).\r\nThe\r\n  Florida Family Court was endowed with the jurisdiction to decide issues related\r\n  to the marital property of the parties and the equitable division of that\r\n  property.Â  See Fla. Stat. Ann. Â§ 61.075.Â  The Florida Court exercised\r\n  this jurisdiction in approving the antenuptial agreement signed by the parties\r\n  and in specifically allocating to each party the property individually titled\r\n  in his or her name and the personal property he or she controlled.Â   \r\nAssuming\r\n  the Florida court had the power to determine issues related to the note and\r\n  mortgage on the property, neither party raised the issues, and the Florida court did not address the debt in its divorce decree.Â  The sole determination by\r\n  the Florida court would have been to determine to which party the property and\r\n  any interest in Diablita or Ely Place belonged.Â  Cf. Davis v.\r\n    Dieujuste, 496 So.2d 806 (Fla. 1986).Â  The Florida court upheld the\r\n  antenuptial agreement which, when applied in this case, resulted in the Kershaw County property being distributed to Appellant and Respondent retaining whatever\r\n  interest he may have had in Ely Place.Â  There were no further issues related to\r\n  the property for the Florida court to determine.Â  Additionally, the Florida divorce action would not have been an appropriate forum for a foreclosure action to\r\n  occur because Ely Place held the note and mortgage, and it was not a party to\r\n  the divorce action.Â  As a result, the divorce decree did not eliminate the\r\n  third-party debt to Ely Place, and res judicata would not apply\r\n  to prevent a foreclosure in South Carolina.Â  See, e.g., Florida Bar\r\n    v. Rodriguez, 959 So.2d 150, 158 (Fla. 2007) (requiring â€œ(1) identity of\r\n  the thing sued for; (2) identity of the cause of action; (3) identity of\r\n  persons and parties to the action; and (4) â€˜identity of quality in persons for\r\n  or against whom claim is made.â€™â€).Â  Moreover, under Florida law, a suit seeking\r\n  transfer of title to real estate is considered to be quasi in rem and must be\r\n  brought in the county where the land is situated.Â  See Goedmakers v.\r\n    Goedmakers, 520 So.2d 575 (Fla. 1988).Â  Although a mortgage does not\r\n  transfer title, it subjects the title to a lien, and a successful foreclosure\r\n  would transfer legal title to the subject property.Â  Thus, the Florida divorce court did not have jurisdiction to entertain an action to foreclose or\r\n  invalidate the mortgage lien in question.Â  See Hammond v.

Derham Cole, Circuit Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2008-UP-004\r\nSubmitted December 1, 2007 â€“ Filed January\r\n  2, 2008\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tDaniel Lawrence Prenner, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tRobert Eric Davis, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this\r\n  action to recover under a policy of underinsured motorist coverage, the Estate\r\n  of Tracy Smith (the Estate) argues the statutory definition of â€œinsuredâ€ does\r\n  not restrict an insured to living in one household for purposes of insurance\r\n  coverage.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nErnest\r\n  and Brenda Smith (collectively the Smiths) purchased land in Spartanburg County and established a residence there (the Spartanburg County home) in the\r\n  1970s.Â  Later, the Smiths subdivided some of the acreage and deeded ownership\r\n  of ten acres to each of their four sons.Â  Ernest retained, in his name alone,\r\n  ownership of this home and the land immediately surrounding it.Â  In 1989, while\r\n  still living at the Spartanburg County home, the Smiths purchased a second home\r\n  in Laurens County (the Laurens County home).Â   \r\nThe\r\n  Smiths lived at the Spartanburg County home, periodically visiting the Laurens County home as their â€œsummer home.â€Â  When Brenda Smith retired in November of 1999,\r\n  she moved to the Laurens County home.Â  While he visited his wife in Laurens County on occasion, Ernest Smith continued to work full-time and to live at the Spartanburg   County home.Â  Ernest Smith retired in March of 2003 and moved to the Laurens County home with Brenda.Â  However, Ernest Smith continued to work part-time in Spartanburg   County after his retirement.Â  Ernest occasionally stayed in the Spartanburg   County home when working and kept some personal items and clothing there.Â  Ernest\r\n  did not have his driverâ€™s license updated to reflect his Laurens County address.Â  However, Ernest stated he â€œconsidered [his] household after March 2003 to be\r\n  with [his] wifeâ€ at the Laurens County home.Â   \r\nTracy\r\n  Smith was the Smithsâ€™ 42-year-old son.Â  In May of 2004, Tracy was living in the\r\n  Spartanburg County home.Â  He would occasionally visit his parents at the Laurens County home, but he did not live there.Â  On May 24, 2004, Tracy was a passenger in\r\n  an automobile owned and driven by Wayne K. McGraw, Jr.Â  McGrawâ€™s vehicle\r\n  collided with Lewis Lesesne Scottâ€™s vehicle, and Tracy was killed in the\r\n  accident.Â  Tracy had no automobile insurance at the time of his death.Â   \r\nAt\r\n  the time of Tracyâ€™s death, the Smiths owned and paid taxes on the Spartanburg   County home.Â  They did not maintain insurance on that home.Â  The Smiths insured\r\n  their automobiles through the Auto-Owners Insurance Company (Auto-Owners).Â  The\r\n  automobile insurance policy listed the Laurens County home as the Smithsâ€™\r\n  residence.Â   \r\nAfter\r\n  the wreck, Scott sued McGraw.Â  Tracyâ€™s son, Brandon Smith, intervened on behalf\r\n  of the Estate and subsequently joined Auto-Owners as a defendant.Â  Scott and\r\n  McGraw settled with each other and with the Estate and are not parties to this\r\n  appeal.Â  The Estate and Auto-Owners submitted the issue of â€œwhether Tracy Smith\r\n  qualifies as an insured under Ernest and Brenda Smithâ€™s underinsured motorist\r\n  coverageâ€ to the trial court for determination.Â  In an order dated September\r\n  28, 2006, the circuit court ruled Tracy Smith was not an insured party under\r\n  his parentsâ€™ policy.Â  This appeal followed.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  determination of coverage under an insurance policy is an action at law.Â  Nationwide\r\n    Mut. Ins.Co. v. Prioleau, 359 S.C. 238, 241, 597 S.E.2d 165, 167 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004); see also Kizer v. Kinard, 361 S.C. 68, 71, 602 S.E.2d 783,\r\n  785 (Ct. App. 2004) (determination of whether underinsured motorist coverage\r\n  applies is an action at law).Â  In an action at law, tried without a jury, the\r\n  appellate court standard of review extends only to the correction of errors of\r\n  law. &nbsp;Pope v. Gordon, 369 S.C. 469, 474, 633 S.E.2d 148, 151 (2006).&nbsp; We\r\n  will not disturb the trial courtâ€™s findings of fact unless those findings are\r\n  â€œwholly unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an erroneous conception or\r\n  application of the law.â€ &nbsp;Gordon v. Colonial Ins.\r\n    Co. of Cal., 342 S.C. 152, 155, 536 S.E.2d 376, 378 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nThe\r\n  determination of resident relative status is a question of fact, and thus, we\r\n  will not disturb the circuit courtâ€™s ruling if the record contains any evidence\r\n  supporting it.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nEstate\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in ruling Tracy Smith was not an insured\r\n  resident of Ernestâ€™s household in Spartanburg County.Â  We do not reach the\r\n  merits of this issue because it is not preserved for our review.Â   \r\nAn\r\n  issue must be raised and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for\r\n  appeal.Â  Harkins v. Greenville County, 340 S.C. 606, 620, 533 S.E.2d\r\n  886, 893 (2000); Iâ€™On v.

[1]\r\nOn\r\n  May 15, 2000, Slezak filed an inmate grievance with the South Carolina\r\n  Department of Corrections.Â  It read as follows:\r\n\r\n\tRequest\r\n  that my work credits be corrected to reflect that I be given credit for my\r\n  entire sentence of the court on January 18, 1982.Â  I have not be[en] given work\r\n  credits and my parole eligibility date is incorrect.Â  See S.C. Code Â§\r\n  24-21-635 (1981) &amp; State v. Varner, 310 S.C. 264, 265, 423 S.E.2d\r\n  133, 134 (1992); Al-Shabazz v. State, Op. No. 24995 (S.C. Sup. Ct. refilled Feb. 14, 2000) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 6 at 21).Â \r\n\t\r\n\r\nWhere\r\n  the form asked Slezak to describe the action he wanted taken, he responded, â€œGrant\r\n  work credits for entire sentence since court sentenced me until present [and]\r\n  notify parole board of correction.â€Â   \r\nThe\r\n  Department denied Slezakâ€™s grievance after review.Â  Its decision gave January\r\n  26, 1981, as his commitment date, found him not entitled to receive earned work\r\n  credits because of his life sentence, and listed July 21, 2000, as his parole\r\n  eligibility date.Â  Slezak appealed, contending â€œthe controlling date for work\r\n  credits is . . . the date I was sentenced.â€Â  The Department once again denied Slezakâ€™s\r\n  grievance on the ground his life sentence precluded him from earning work\r\n  credits.  \r\nThe\r\n  Administrative Law Judge Division thereafter affirmed the Departmentâ€™s decision\r\n  and Slezak appealed to the circuit court, contending his initial parole\r\n  eligibility date was later than it should have been had he received earned work\r\n  credits.Â  That court affirmed the order of the Administrative Law Judge\r\n  Division, finding, among other things, the issue raised by Slezak in his appeal\r\n  regarding his not being given earned work credits to be moot â€œ[e]ven if [Slezak]\r\n  was entitled to the work credits.â€Â   \r\nWe\r\n  agree with the circuit court.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  record shows July 21, 2000, Slezakâ€™s initial parole date as determined by the\r\n  Department, has long since come and gone.Â  Moreover, he was denied parole on\r\n  that date and, apparently, since that time; consequently, the question of\r\n  whether he should have received a parole hearing at an earlier date because of\r\n  earned work credits to which he may have been entitled is of no moment.Â  He proved\r\n  not to be a candidate for parole in any case.Â  For us to decide the question of\r\n  whether the Department wrongfully denied Slezak earned work credits would\r\n  accomplish nothing and would constitute merely an advisory opinion on our part.Â \r\n  We do not issue advisory opinions.Â  Dodge v. Dodge, 332 S.C. 401, 420, 505\r\n  S.E.2d 344, 354 (Ct. App. 1998).  \r\nSlezak\r\n  also appeals the circuit courtâ€™s holding that the Court of General Sessions\r\n  lacked subject matter jurisdiction at the time he entered his guilty plea.Â \r\n  This issue is manifestly without merit.Â  State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610\r\n  S.E.2d 494 (2005); see Rule 220(2), SCACR (â€œThe Court of Appeals need\r\n  not address a point which is manifestly without meritâ€).  \r\nFinally,\r\n  Slezak appeals the failure of the circuit court to convert his grievance\r\n  petition into a post-conviction application.Â  This issue was neither raised to\r\n  nor ruled upon by the circuit court and may not now be heard.Â  See Wilder\r\n    Corp. v.

[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn January 26, 2002, Pellitteri sustained an injury to\r\n  his left leg arising out of his employment as a tile installer for Pellitteri\r\n  Tile. Â As a result of his injury, Pelliteri underwent surgery on March 8, 2002.\r\n  Â During his recovery, Pelliteri was unable to install tile; but he was able to\r\n  evaluate potential jobs and provide estimates. Â Pellitteri injured his right\r\n  leg on April 1, 2002, while providing an estimate. Â Pellitteri sought medical\r\n  benefits and reimbursement for past due medical expenses relating to his right leg\r\n  injury. Â South Carolina\r\n  Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association (Guaranty Association) denied Pelliteriâ€™s\r\n  claim, arguing the claim was barred by an agreement and release entered into\r\n  between Pellitteri, Pellitteri Tile, and Legion Insurance Company on February\r\n  14, 2003. Â \r\nAfter a hearing on November 3, 2004, the single\r\n  commissioner issued an order finding Pellitteri sustained a compensable injury\r\n  to his right leg. Â The commissioner further found the release did not bar\r\n  Pellitteriâ€™s claim involving his right leg.[2] Â The commissioner concluded the release â€œcovered only those injuries related to\r\n  the Claimantâ€™s left leg injury which occurred on January 26, 2002.â€ Â Guaranty\r\n  Association appealed to the appellate panel. The appellate panel affirmed the\r\n  single commissionerâ€™s findings. Â Guaranty Association then sought judicial\r\n  review in the circuit court. Â The circuit court affirmed the order of the full\r\n  commission in its entirety. Â Guaranty Association appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGuaranty Association asserts the release barred Pellitteri from receiving benefits under the South Carolina Workersâ€™\r\n  Compensation Act for his right knee injury.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe release provides Pellitteri sustained injuries on\r\n  January 26, 2002, and would receive compensation in the amount of $50,000.00.Â  The\r\n  agreement further provides the sum is:\r\n\r\n\tÂ [I]n full and\r\n  final settlement and satisfaction for any and all claims for further\r\n  compensation and medical [sic] due as the result of any injury or injuries,\r\n  reported or unreported, known or unknown, while an employee of the employer,\r\n  including, but not limited to all claims for permanent and temporary, total and\r\n  partial disability, functional and specific loss, disfigurement, change of\r\n  condition, death and funeral benefits, loss of function or impairment of any\r\n  scheduled or non-scheduled members of the body, any claims of psychological or\r\n  emotional injury or impairment, and past or future medical expenses as the\r\n  result of the injury described herein . . . . \r\n\r\nA release is a contract and rules of contract should be\r\n  used to determine what the parties intended.Â  Ecclesiastes Production\r\n    Ministries v. Outparcel Associates, LLC, 374 S.C. 483, 497, 649 S.E.2d 494,\r\n  501 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  The construction of a contract is a question of law for\r\n  the court.Â  Auten v. Snipes, 370 S.C. 664, 669-70, 636 S.E.2d 644, 647 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  In construing a contract, the courts function is to interpret the contracts\r\n  lawful meaning, discover the intention of the parties as provided within the contract,\r\n  and give effect to the partiesâ€™ intention.Â  Id.Â  When a contract is\r\n  clear and unequivocal, its meaning must be determined by its content alone.Â  State\r\n    v. Cochran, 358 S.C. 24, 27, 594 S.E.2d 844, 845 (2004).\r\nHere, the meaning of the release is plain.Â  The release\r\n  provides that it is a â€œfull and final settlementâ€ of all claims â€œas the result\r\n  of the injury described herein.â€ Â The only injury described within the release\r\n  relates to Pellitteriâ€™s left leg.Â  Page one of the release describes\r\n  Pellitteriâ€™s injury as having occurred on January 26, 2002. Â In addition, the\r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation file number listed in the release is 0201583, the file\r\n  number assigned to Pellitteriâ€™s claim for his left leg injury.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  the third page of the release provides that the â€œcombined effect of\r\n  [Pellitteriâ€™s] prior impairment and the injury or injuries described herein was\r\n  such to produce Eighteen percent (18%) permanent functional impairment of\r\n    [Pellitteriâ€™s] left leg. . . .â€ (emphasis added). Â The language of the\r\n  release does not mention an injury to Pellitteriâ€™s right leg, the file number\r\n  assigned to the claim for Pellitteriâ€™s right leg injury, or the date the right\r\n  leg injury took place.Â  The parties clearly could have included language in the\r\n  release barring claims for Pellitteriâ€™s right leg injury had that been their\r\n  intent as the release was dated after Pellitteri injured his right leg. Â \r\nGuaranty Association argues broad language in the\r\n  release stating the release is final settlement â€œfor any and all claims for\r\n  further compensation and medical [sic] due as the result of any injury or\r\n  injuries, reported or unreported, known or unknown, while an employee of the\r\n  employerâ€ bars Pellitteri from recovery for all injuries prior to the date of\r\n  approval of the release.Â  The release, however, also includes specific language\r\n  limiting its effect to â€œthe injury or injuries described herein.â€ Â Reading the\r\n  release as a whole, it is clearly limited to claims relating to Pellitteriâ€™s\r\n  left leg injury.Â  See Campbell v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 301 S.C.\r\n  448, 452, 392 S.E.2d 477, 480 (Ct. App. 1990) (stating a release must be read\r\n  as a whole); Thomas-McCain, Inc. v. Siter, 268 S.C. 193, 197, 232 S.E.2d\r\n  728, 729 (1977) (â€œWhere the agreement in question is a written contract, the\r\n  partiesâ€™ intention must be gathered from the contents of the entire agreement\r\n  and not from any particular clause thereof.â€). Â Â \r\nGuaranty\r\n  Association asserts that even if the release is limited to Pellitteriâ€™s left\r\n  leg injury, Pellitteriâ€™s right leg injury is barred because it resulted from\r\n  the left leg injury.Â  The commissioner, however, found Pellitteriâ€™s right leg\r\n  injury resulted from his work as a tile installer that required Pellitteri to\r\n  perform significant bending, stooping, and kneeling. Â Substantial evidence\r\n  supports the commissionerâ€™s finding.Â  By letter of September 18, 2002,\r\n  Pellitteriâ€™s physician opined â€œI do not believe Mr. Pellitteriâ€™s right knee\r\n  meniscus tear is a result of overuse due to his left knee injury but more the\r\n  overuse due to his occupation, which requires a significant amount of bending,\r\n  stooping and kneeling . . . .â€Â  We therefore affirm the commissionerâ€™s\r\n  finding.Â  See Howell v.

Elliott, Senior\r\n  Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia, and\r\n  Assistant Solicitor Christina Theos Adams, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Christopher\r\n  Oâ€™Donald appeals from his convictions for burglary first and grand larceny.Â  Oâ€™Donald\r\n  contends the trial judge erred in (1) trying him in absentia without notice of\r\n  his right to be present and without warning that he would be tried in his absence\r\n  should he fail to attend; and (2) finding the assistant solicitorâ€™s comment\r\n  during closing argument about Oâ€™Donaldâ€™s absence was proper.Â  We affirm. [1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nAn Oconee County grand jury indicted Oâ€™Donald for grand larceny in an amount greater than\r\n  $5,000, distribution of an imitation controlled substance, and first-degree\r\n  burglary.Â  When Oâ€™Donald posted bond on February 4, 2005, he signed an order\r\n  specifying the methods and conditions of his release.Â  The order read as\r\n  follows:  \r\n\r\n\tThat\r\n  the defendant shall appear at . . .Â  the term of court of general sessions\r\n  beginning on March 21, 2005 . . . and remain there throughout that term of\r\n  court.Â  If no disposition is made during that term, the defendant shall appear\r\n  and remain throughout each succeeding term of court until final disposition is\r\n  made of his case, unless otherwise ordered by the court.Â  \r\n\r\nOâ€™Donaldâ€™s initial trial occurred in August of 2005.Â \r\n  Oâ€™Donald did not attend the trial.Â  The trial resulted in a hung jury.Â \r\n  Oâ€™Donaldâ€™s trial was rescheduled for the September 19, 2005 term of court.Â \r\n  Prior to trial, the solicitorâ€™s office delivered a card to Oâ€™Donaldâ€™s residence\r\n  and Oâ€™Donaldâ€™s bonding company. Â The card stated Oâ€™Donald was required to\r\n  appear in court on September 19, 2005.Â  In addition, the card warned Oâ€™Donald\r\n  that failure to appear would result in a bench warrant, and he could be tried\r\n  in his absence.Â   \r\nOn September 21, 2005, the State moved to try Oâ€™Donald\r\n  in absentia.Â  In support of its motion, the State introduced copies of the card\r\n  delivered to Oâ€™Donaldâ€™s residence and the order relating to Oâ€™Donaldâ€™s bond.Â  Oâ€™Donaldâ€™s\r\n  counsel objected and moved for a continuance on the grounds that Oâ€™Donald did\r\n  not receive proper notice. Â Specifically, Oâ€™Donaldâ€™s counsel argued:  \r\n\r\n\tYour\r\n  honor, my position is if [the solicitorâ€™s office] know[s] where to go and give\r\n  him a note, they know where to go arrest him on a bench warrant, which was\r\n  issued last term. They can take him to the jail and then heâ€™ll be here at the\r\n  next term of court when we can try the case with him here. \r\n\r\nThe judge denied the motion\r\n  for a continuance and proceeded with the trial.  \r\nPrior to opening arguments, the trial judge talked to\r\n  the jury concerning Oâ€™Donaldâ€™s absence.Â  The trial judge stated as follows:\r\n\r\n\tI will\r\n  tell you that the Defendant does not have to be here.Â  Our system allows for a\r\n  Defendant to waive his presence during the course of the trial.Â  The Defendant\r\n  is still presumed innocent, even though [he is] not here, and that is a very\r\n  important tenet.Â  And I know itâ€™s sometimes hard for jurors to get their mind\r\n  around, but that Defendant, even though [he is] not here, is still presumed\r\n  innocent, the burden is still on the State to prove [its] case.Â  So you\r\n  shouldnâ€™t hold it against the Defendant or the Defense that the Defendant is\r\n  not present in the courtroom today. \r\n\r\nThe trial adjourned and recovened the next morning.Â  After\r\n  the State and the defense had rested, Oâ€™Donald appeared in the courtroom. Â The trial\r\n  judge questioned Oâ€™Donald regarding his right to be present during the trial. Â Oâ€™Donald\r\n  stated he had talked to his lawyer, he understood he had a right to be present,\r\n  and he understood he was facing up to life imprisonment. Â Oâ€™Donald further\r\n  stated he did not want to be present, and he did not want to talk to his lawyer\r\n  about any other options. Â Oâ€™Donald told the trial judge to â€œhave a good oneâ€\r\n  and left the courtroom. Â The trial judge found Oâ€™Donald understood his rights\r\n  and did not want to be present for the trial.  \r\nThe trial resumed,\r\n  and the State and the Defense made closing arguments.Â  During the Stateâ€™s\r\n  closing argument, the assistant solicitor stated, â€œThis is [the victimâ€™s] only\r\n  day in court, itâ€™s Chris Oâ€™Donaldâ€™s only day in court.Â  I submit to you, even\r\n  though heâ€™s not here, for whatever reason, the Judge will tell you you canâ€™t\r\n  consider that.â€ Â Oâ€™Donaldâ€™s counsel objected to the solicitorâ€™s comment because\r\n  it referred to Oâ€™Donaldâ€™s absence. Â The trial judge overruled the objection,\r\n  stating the comment was proper.  \r\nFollowing closing arguments, the trial judge charged\r\n  the jury.Â  He instructed the jury not to consider the fact that the Defendant\r\n  was not present and did not testify.Â  The trial judge added the Defendant had a\r\n  constitutional right to be absent and silent. Â The trial judge reiterated â€œyou\r\n  are to draw no conclusion whatsoever from the fact that the Defendant in this\r\n  case did not appear or testify[,] . . . [it] should not even be discussed in\r\n  the jury room.Â   \r\nThe jury returned\r\n  verdicts of guilty for burglary first and grand larceny in an amount between\r\n  $1,000 and $5,000.Â  The jury found Oâ€™Donald not guilty of distribution of an\r\n  imitation controlled substance.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Trial in Absentia\r\nOâ€™Donald first asserts the trial judge erred in trying\r\n  him in absentia without making the proper findings of fact that he received\r\n  notice of his right to be present and was warned he would be tried in his\r\n  absence should he fail to attend.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nAlthough the Sixth\r\n  Amendment of the Constitution guarantees the right of a criminal defendant to\r\n  be present at trial, this right may be waived.Â  Ellis v. State, 267 S.C.\r\n  257, 260, 227 S.E.2d 304, 305 (1976); State v. Fairey, 374 S.C. 92, 99, 646\r\n  S.E.2d 445, 448 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  Rule 16, SCRCrimP provides:\r\n\r\n\tExcept\r\n  in cases wherein capital punishment is a permissible sentence, a person\r\n  indicted for misdemeanors and/or felonies may voluntarily waive his right to be\r\n  present and may be tried in his absence upon a finding by the court that such\r\n  person has received notice of his right to be present and that a warning was\r\n  given that the trial would proceed in his absence upon a failure to attend the\r\n  court.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhile Rule 16 permits a\r\n  knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to be present, such a waiver is\r\n  permitted only in limited circumstances.â€Â  City of Aiken v. Koontz, 368\r\n  S.C. 542, 547, 629 S.E.2d 686, 689 (2006).Â  The trial court must determine the\r\n  defendant voluntarily waived his right to be present.Â  Id.Â  In addition,\r\n  the trial court must make factual findings that the defendant (1) received\r\n  notice of his right to be present; and (2) was warned that the trial would\r\n  proceed in his absence upon his failure to attend.Â  Id.Â   \r\nNotice\r\n  of the term of court in which the defendant will be tried is sufficient to\r\n  enable the defendant to make an effective waiver of his right to be present.Â  Ellis,\r\n  267 S.C. at 261, 227 S.E.2d at 306.Â  But if the record does not reveal evidence\r\n  that the defendant was given notice of his trial, the resulting conviction in\r\n  absentia cannot stand.Â  State v. Jackson, 290 S.C. 435, 436, 351 S.E. 2d\r\n  167, 167 (1986).\r\nHere,\r\n  it is manifest Oâ€™Donald had notice of the trial because he appeared in the\r\n  courtroom during his trial and testified he did not wish to be present. Â Furthermore,\r\n  the record is replete with evidence that Oâ€™Donald was notified to be in court\r\n  for his trial.Â  The bond order that Oâ€™Donald signed required Oâ€™Donald to be in\r\n  court during the March 21, 2005 term of court and to â€œappear and remain\r\n    throughout each succeeding term of court until final disposition is made of his\r\n    case.â€ (emphasis added).Â  The language requiring Oâ€™Donald to â€œremain\r\n  throughout each succeeding term of courtâ€ is sufficient to put Oâ€™Donald on\r\n  notice of his trial.Â  See City of Aiken 368 S.C. at 548, 629\r\n  S.E.2d at 689 (holding a defendant had notice of his October 20, 2004 trial\r\n  date where the trial date was set by court order and where defendant signed a\r\n  bond form requiring the defendant to appear for trial on June 28, 2004 and\r\n  â€œsuch other times and places as ordered by the courtâ€).Â  In addition, the\r\n  solicitorâ€™s office delivered a card to Oâ€™Donaldâ€™s residence and bonding company\r\n  notifying Oâ€™Donald of the trial date.Â   \r\nAlso,\r\n  the trial court made the requisite factual finding relating to whether Oâ€™Donald\r\n  was warned he would be tried in absentia should he fail to attend his trial.Â \r\n  After questioning Oâ€™Donald concerning this right to be present, the trial court\r\n  found Oâ€™Donald was aware of his right to be present and did not wish to attend\r\n  his trial. Â There is evidence to support this finding. The trial transcript\r\n  shows Oâ€™Donald appeared in the courtroom during his trial and informed the\r\n  trial judge he did not wish to be present.Â  In addition, the bond order\r\n  contained an â€œAcknowledgement by Defendantâ€ paragraph, that read: â€œI understand\r\n  and have been informed that I have a right and obligation to be present at\r\n  trial and should I fail to attend the court, the trial will proceed in my absence.â€\r\n  Â See Fairey, 374 S.C. at 101, 646 S.E.2d at 449 (â€œA bond form\r\n  that provides notice that a defendant can be tried in absentia may serve as the\r\n  requisite notice.â€).\r\nAt\r\n  any rate, Oâ€™Donaldâ€™s appearance in the courtroom during the trial and his\r\n  testimony that he did not wish to attend his trial cured any error the trial\r\n  court may have committed regarding Oâ€™Donaldâ€™s right to notice and right to be\r\n  present at his trial and such conduct constituted a waiver of that right.Â \r\n \r\nII.Â  Solicitorâ€™s Comments\r\nOâ€™Donald\r\n  also asserts the trial court erred in overruling his counselâ€™s objection when\r\n  the assistant solicitor made a comment to the jury regarding Oâ€™Donaldâ€™s\r\n  absence.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  State may not comment on a defendantâ€™s exercise of a constitutional right.Â  Edmond v. State, 341 S.C. 340, 345, 534 S.E.2d 682, 685 (2000).Â \r\n  Specifically, the State may not comment either directly or indirectly, on a\r\n  defendantâ€™s silence, failure to testify, or failure to present a defense.Â  McFadden\r\n    v. State, 342 S.C. 637, 640, 539 S.E.2d 391, 393 (2000).Â  Improper comments\r\n  on a defendantâ€™s exercise of a constitutional right, however, do not\r\n  automatically require reversal if they are not prejudicial to the defendant.Â  State\r\n    v. Cooper, 334 S.C. 540, 554, 514 S.E.2d 584, 591 (1999).\r\nHere, during the\r\n  Stateâ€™s closing argument, the assistant solicitor made an indirect comment regarding Oâ€™Donaldâ€™s absence.Â  The assistant solicitor stated, â€œitâ€™s Chris Oâ€™Donaldâ€™s\r\n  only day in court[,] . . .Â  even though heâ€™s not here, for whatever reason, the\r\n  Judge will tell you you canâ€™t consider that.â€ Â The trial judge, however, thoroughly\r\n  charged the jury concerning Oâ€™Donaldâ€™s absence.Â  In his opening charge, the\r\n  trial judge told the jury a Defendant may waive his presence during trial, and despite\r\n  the Defendantâ€™s absence, he is still presumed innocent and the burden is still\r\n  on the State to prove its case. Â The judge added that the jury was not to hold Oâ€™Donaldâ€™s\r\n  absence against Oâ€™Donald or the defense. Â As part of his closing charges, the\r\n  trial judge told the jury the Defendantâ€™s absence, failure to testify, and\r\n  failure to present a defense were not to be considered. Â In addition, the trial\r\n  judge explained that Oâ€™Donald had a constitutional right to be absent and\r\n  silent.  \r\nWe hold the trial\r\n  judgeâ€™s instructions to the jury cured any prejudice to Oâ€™Donald.Â  See Cooper,\r\n  334 S.C. at 554, 514 S.E.2d at 591 Â (holding even if the solicitorâ€™s comments\r\n  referred to Defendantâ€™s failure to testify or present a defense at trial, any\r\n  prejudice was cured by the trial judgeâ€™s instructions); Johnson v. State,\r\n  325 S.C. 182, 480 S.E.2d 733 (1997) (holding even if the comment was improper,\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s instruction that the jury could not consider the defendantâ€™s\r\n  failure to testify in any way and could not hold it against him was sufficient\r\n  to cure any error).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the trial courtâ€™s rulings are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF AND PIEPER, JJ. and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-008","title":"Newton v.

Calvert, 287 S.C. 130, 138, 336 S.E.2d 884, 888-89\r\n  (Ct.

Â§ 20-7-1350 (Supp. 2006) (â€œAn adult who willfully\r\n  violates, neglects, or refuses to obey or perform a lawful order of the court .\r\n  . . may be proceeded against for contempt of court.â€); Brandt v.

Donahue,\r\n  299 S.C. 353, 365, 384 S.E.2d 741, 748 (1989) (â€œAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees and\r\n  costs is a discretionary matter not to be overturned absent abuse by the trial\r\n  court.â€); Singleton v.

[1]\r\nHarold Rutledge\r\n  contends the hearing court erred in finding that he waived his right to\r\n  counsel.Â  Rutledge properly raises this issue for the first time on appeal.Â  See State v. Rocheville, 310 S.C. 20, 25 n.4, 425 S.E.2d 32, 35 n.4 (1993)\r\n  (stating an exception to the contemporaneous objection rule exists when the\r\n  record lacks evidence of a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to\r\n  counsel because a pro se defendant should not be expected to\r\n  raise the issue without assistance of counsel); State v. White, 305 S.C.\r\n  455, 456, 409 S.E.2d 397, 397 (1991) (holding because the defendant appeared pro se at his sentencing hearing, the first time the defendant could raise\r\n  the issue of lack of knowing and intelligent waiver of right to counsel was on\r\n  appeal).\r\nThe\r\n  record before us falls far short of establishing that Rutledge waived his right\r\n  to counsel knowingly and intelligently and with the required warning regarding\r\n  dangers of self-representation.Â  See Huckaby v. State, 305 S.C.\r\n  331, 335, 408 S.E.2d 242, 244 (1991) (stating a defendant in a probation\r\n  revocation hearing must be advised of his right to counsel, the hearing court\r\n  must determine if a defendantâ€™s request to proceed pro se constituted a knowing and intelligent waiver, and the hearing court must make\r\n  defendant aware of the dangers of self-representation).Â  Further, the State\r\n  concedes Rutledge was not warned against the dangers of self-representation and\r\n  Rutledge did not affirmatively waive his right to counsel.\r\nWe\r\n  reverse the circuit courtâ€™s determination that Rutledge waived his right to\r\n  counsel and remand the case for a new probation revocation hearing.\r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â We decide this case without oral\r\n  argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-011","title":"Paschal v.

Craig Wilkerson\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2008-UP-018\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2008 â€“ Filed January\r\n  10, 2008Â Â Â  \r\nDISMISSED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tMark Weston Hardee, of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\n\t\t\t\tWeston Adams, III, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIUM: In this consolidated appeal\r\n  of fourteen foreclosure actions, Donald Lewis Hofer (Hofer) and Falcon\r\n  Unlimited, L.P. (Falcon) argue the special referee erred in dismissing Hofer from\r\n  the proceedings.Â  We dismiss. [1]\r\nFACTUAL / PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nHofer executed a note and mortgage to Wachovia Bank,\r\n  NA (Wachovia), as successor in interest to First Federal Savings Bank. Â The\r\n  note and mortgage secured various properties in York County, South Carolina.Â \r\n  Hofer subsequently conveyed the properties to Falcon, the current owner of the\r\n  properties. Â In 1998, Wachovia initiated foreclosure proceedings against Hofer\r\n  and Falcon (collectively â€œAppellantsâ€). Â Wachovia entered into a settlement\r\n  agreement with Appellants in 2001.  \r\nOn April\r\n  25, 2005, Wachovia brought the instant foreclosure actions. Â Appellants answered,\r\n  counterclaimed, and requested a jury trial.Â  Wachovia moved to dismiss Hofer\r\n  from the case on the ground that he was not a required or necessary party.Â  By\r\n  order dated January 25, 2006, the special referee dismissed Hofer from the\r\n  proceedings. Â Â Appellants appeal.\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nThe sole\r\n  issue set forth in Appellantsâ€™ brief states as follows:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  special refereeâ€™s orders [sic] dismissing Donald Lewis Hofer from these series\r\n  of foreclosure cases were in error since Donald Lewis Hofer had submitted\r\n  answers with counterclaims and he had asserted his right to a jury trial.\r\n\r\nThe argument section of Appellantsâ€™\r\n  brief, however, nowhere addresses Hoferâ€™s dismissal from the foreclosure\r\n  proceedings.Â  We therefore decline to address this issue.Â  See First\r\n    Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (stating\r\n  an appellant must provide authority and supporting arguments for his issue to\r\n  be considered on appeal); Ellie, Inc. v. Miccichi,&nbsp; 358 S.C. 78,\r\n  99, 594 S.E.2d 485, 496&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004) (holding an issue is deemed\r\n  abandoned where argued in only a short conclusory statement); Fields v.\r\n    Fields, 342 S.C. 182, 191 n.8, 536 S.E.2d 684, 689 n.8 (Ct. App. 2000)\r\n  (deeming an issue abandoned where the appellant included the issue in the\r\n  statement of issues on appeal but failed to argue the issue in the body of the\r\n  brief).[2]\r\nAppellants argue in\r\n  their brief the special referee erred in dismissing Appellantsâ€™ counterclaims.Â \r\n  This issue, however, is not set forth in the statement of issues on appeal; therefore,\r\n  this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  See Rule 208(b)(1)(B),\r\n  SCACR; Langehans v.

Pierce Campbell, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  Lucille Taylor (Lucille) appeals\r\n  an order of the trial court holding Pauline T. Williams (Pauline Williams) and\r\n  Gracie T. Thurmond (Thurmond) were each deeded one acre of land in fee simple\r\n  absolute and not fee simple condition subsequent.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  December 14, 1965, D. T. Taylor (D. T.), Lucilleâ€™s father, executed a Last Will\r\n  and Testament and a first codicil.Â  Lucille was devised a tract of land,\r\n  subject to a life estate in favor of D. T.â€™s wife, Edith Taylor.Â  D. T.\r\n  fathered Pauline Williams and Thurmond.Â  Ave Marie Williams (A. M. Williams)\r\n  and Mattie Ann Wright are Pauline Williamsâ€™ daughters.Â  Mattie Ann Wright is\r\n  married to Isaac Wright (collectively the Wrights).\r\nD. T.â€™s\r\n  codicil provided in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\tI hereby\r\n  amend ITEM I of the said will so as to provide that in the event my daughter,\r\n  Gracie Thurmond, or my daughter, Pauline Williams, or both of them, desire to\r\n  obtain an acre of land each as a home site for themselves that my wife Edith\r\n  Taylor and my daughter Lucile [sic] Taylor convey to them, or either of them, a\r\n  deed for such one acre of land for each of them upon the payment of the sum of\r\n  One ($1.00) Dollar by each of them for the said land.Â  \r\n\r\nD. T. passed away on February\r\n  3, 1966, and his Last Will and Testament and the codicil were duly probated.\r\nOn\r\n  March 19, 1974, Lucille and Edith Taylor conveyed Pauline Williams and Thurmond\r\n  each one acre of the land D. T. devised them.Â  The granting clause in Pauline\r\n  Williamsâ€™ deed reads: Â â€œEdith Taylor and Lucile [sic] Taylor . . . have\r\n  granted, bargained, sold and released, by these presents do grant, bargain,\r\n  sell and release unto the said Pauline T. Williams, her heirs and assigns, forever.â€Â \r\n  In Thurmondâ€™s deed, the granting clause contains identical language:Â  â€œEdith\r\n  Taylor and Lucile [sic] Taylor . . . have granted, bargained, sold and released,\r\n  by these presents do grant, bargain sell and release unto the said Gracie T.\r\n  Thurmond, her heirs and assigns, forever.â€\r\nFollowing\r\n  a description of the conveyed property, each deed contains a â€œpurpose clauseâ€\r\n  noting:\r\n\r\n\tThis\r\n  deed is being executed by the grantors herein in compliance with the terms and\r\n  conditions of the first Codicil, dated December 14, 1965, to the Last Will and\r\n  Testament of D. T. Taylor, dated December 14, 1965, which is duly filed in the\r\n  office of the Judge of Probate for Marion County in Probate Roll No. 6670, and\r\n  the property herein conveyed is for the use by the grantees as â€œa home siteâ€ as\r\n  more fully set forth in the aforedescribed Codicil.\r\n\r\nBoth\r\n  deeds have habendum clauses located after the purpose clause which say:Â  â€œTo\r\n  Have and to Hold all and singular the premises before mentioned unto the said\r\n  Pauline T. Williams [Gracie T. Thurmond], her Heirs and Assigns forever.â€Â \r\n \r\nThurmond\r\n  subsequently deeded her parcel to Pauline Williams.Â  On January 21, 1991, Pauline\r\n  Williams conveyed one tract of her land to A. M. Williams and the other to the\r\n  Wrights.Â  Neither Thurmond nor Pauline Williams used their respective tracts of\r\n  land as home sites.\r\nOn\r\n  August 31, 2005, Lucille commenced suit to quiet title to the two tracts of\r\n  land conveyed to Pauline Williams and Thurmond, now owned by the Wrights and A.\r\n  M. Williams.Â  Lucille sought to have the trial court declare her the fee simple\r\n  owner of both parcels.Â  The court denied her claim, explaining:\r\n\r\n\tWhen\r\n  [Lucille Taylor] and Edith Taylor conveyed fee simple absolute estate in the\r\n  granting clause by use of clear and plain words of inheritance, the provisions\r\n  inserted in the deeds after the descriptions of the property to the effect that\r\n  the property had to be used as a home site by Gracie T. Thurmond and Pauline T.\r\n  Williams were not conditions subsequent, and the deeds to Gracie T. Thurmond\r\n  and Pauline T. Williams conveyed fee simple absolute estates.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\t1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the trial court err in finding\r\n  both deeds conveyed fee simple absolute?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œ[T]he\r\n  construction of a clear and unambiguous deed is a question of law for the\r\n  court.â€Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 623, 550 S.E.2d 299, 303 (2001); Gardner v.\r\n    Mozingo, 293 S.C. 23, 25, 358 S.E.2d 390, 392 (1987); Hammond v.\r\n      Lindsay, 277 S.C. 182, 184, 284 S.E.2d 581, 582 (1981).Â  â€œ[I]t is the duty\r\n  of the court to construe deeds and determine their legal effect, where there is\r\n  no such ambiguity as requires parol proof and submission to the jury.â€Â Â  26A C.J.S. Deeds Â§ 168 (2001); Bennett v. Investors Title Ins. Co., 370 S.C.\r\n  578, 590, 635 S.E.2d 649, 655 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\n\r\n\tDeeds\r\n  are construed to determine the intent of the parties.Â  To construe a deed, a\r\n  court looks first at the language of the instrument because the court presumes\r\n  it declares the intent of the parties.Â  When, and only when, the meaning of the\r\n  deed is not clear, or is ambiguous or uncertain, will a court resort to\r\n  established rules of construction to aid in the ascertainment of the grantorâ€™s\r\n  intention by artificial means where such intention cannot otherwise be\r\n  ascertained.\r\n\r\n23 Am.Jur.2d Deeds Â§\r\n  192 (2002).Â  â€œ[I]f the language of the deed is unambiguous, then its\r\n  interpretation is a question of law to be resolved by the reviewing court without\r\n  resort to extrinsic evidence.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œWhile a trial courtâ€™s findings of\r\n  fact in a nonjury action at law should not be disturbed on appeal unless they\r\n  are without evidentiary support, a reviewing court is free to decide questions\r\n  of law with no particular deference to the trial court.â€Â  Hunt v. Forestry\r\n    Commâ€™n, 358 S.C. 564, 569, 595 S.E.2d 846, 848-849 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  See Okatie River, L.L.C., v. Southeastern Site Prep, L.L.C., 353 S.C. 327,\r\n  334, 577 S.E.2d 468, 479 (2003) (â€œIn an action at law, tried without a jury,\r\n  the appellate court standard of review extends only to the correction of errors\r\n  of law.â€); Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 341 S.C. 320,\r\n  327, 534 S.E.2d 672, 675 (2000); Rickborn v. Liberty Life Ins. Co., 321\r\n  S.C. 291, 296, 468 S.E.2d 292, 295 (1996); State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v.\r\n    Moorer, 330 S.C. 46, 51, 496 S.E.2d 875, 878 (Ct. App. 1998) (â€œIn legal\r\n  actions, our scope of review extends only to the correction of errors of\r\n  law.â€).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nLucille\r\n  asserts the trial court erred in finding the deeds to Pauline Williams and\r\n  Thurmond conveyed the properties in fee simple absolute.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œ[A]\r\n  complete and absolute estate created in the granting clause cannot be cut down\r\n  by subsequent provisions in the deed.â€Â  Abbeville County v. Knox, 267\r\n  S.C. 38, 40, 225 S.E.2d 863, 864 (1976) (citing Stylecraft, Inc. v. Thomas,\r\n  250 S.C. 495, 498, 159 S.E.2d 46, 47 (1968)).Â  â€œWhile\r\n  it is a cardinal rule of deed construction that the intention of the grantor\r\n  must be ascertained and effectuated, this intention cannot stand\r\n  if it contravenes some well settled rule of law or public policy.â€Â  Hunt\r\n    v. Forestry Commâ€™n, 358 S.C. 564, 571-572, 595 S.E.2d 846, 850 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004); Wayburn v. Smith, 270 S.C. 38, 41, 239 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1977).Â  The South Carolina Court of Appeals â€œwill not\r\n  undertake to overthrow a rule of property so long established.â€ Purvis v. McElveen, 234 S.C. 94, 102, 106 S.E.2d 913, 917 (1959); Hunt, 358 S.C. at 571-572, 595 S.E.2d at 850.Â  â€œThis rule of\r\n  construction must be adhered to even if it runs contrary to the express\r\n  intentions of the grantor.â€Â  Hunt, 358 S.C. at 572, 595 S.E.2d at 850; Stylecraft, 250 S.C. at 497, 159 S.E.2d at 47. \r\n \r\nOur\r\n  Supreme Court best expressed this contention in Creswell v. Bank of Greenwood, 210 S.C. 47, 55, 41 S.E.2d 393, 397 (1947) (quoted in Hunt, 358 S.C. at 572, 595 S.E.2d at 850):\r\n\r\n\t[I]ntention is unavailing to avoid [a rule\r\n  of law] where words of settled legal import are used and contrary principles\r\n  are encountered. In such cases the intention will be conclusively presumed to\r\n  accord with the established meaning of the words and to conform to the fixed\r\n  rules of construction. Otherwise there would be little stability of land\r\n  titles.\r\n\r\nApplying Creswell, this Court in Hunt declared, â€œUpon\r\n  finding that the granting clause of the 1937 deed constitutes a definite grant\r\n  in fee simple, this court must hold that the purpose clause following the\r\n  property description is ineffectual.â€Â  358 S.C. at 572, 595 S.E.2d at 850.\r\nIn\r\n  this case, the granting clauses each convey a fee simple absolute.Â  The purpose\r\n  clauses attempting to restrict the property grants to fee simple condition\r\n  subsequent are ineffectual.Â  While Lucille contends it was the intent of the\r\n  grantors to convey a fee simple condition subsequent to both Pauline Williams\r\n  and Thurmond, this Court will not ignore the clear and unambiguous language in\r\n  the deeds.Â  Therefore, we find both granting clauses in the deeds to Pauline\r\n  Williams and Thurmond constitute definite grants of fee simple absolute and the\r\n  purpose clauses are of no consequence.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, the order of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, SHORT\r\n  and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-021","title":"State v.

Jahue Moore, Jr., and James Edward Bradley, both of West Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Appellant,\r\n  Q.L. Evans Construction Company, appeals the trial courtâ€™s refusal to reduce\r\n  the judgment amount due to an alleged failure on the part of Respondents to\r\n  mitigate their damages.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nBob\r\n  Brandi owns both of the Respondent companies. Â Bob Brandi Stations, Inc.,\r\n  operates convenience stores on land and in stores owned by R.E. Stations,\r\n  Inc..Â  In 1995, Respondents contracted with Mike Hass and his company, Palmetto\r\n  Construction Company, to serve as general contractor for the construction of a\r\n  convenience store. Â Haas had functioned as general contractor on several other\r\n  similar projects for Respondents.Â Â  The contract between Respondents and Haas\r\n  required Haas to supervise the project and to provide a â€œturn keyâ€ finished\r\n  product.Â  Haas contracted with Appellant to install and finish concrete\r\n  driveway areas as part of the project. Â Construction of the convenience store\r\n  began in 1996.  \r\nWhen\r\n  Appellantâ€™s owner, Evans, arrived at the construction site to start work, he\r\n  found the soil at the site had not been properly compacted and was too soft.Â \r\n  Evans informed Haas of the problem with the soil and warned him that the\r\n  concrete would likely fail if installed.[2]Â \r\n  Haas instructed Evans to install the concrete despite the inadequately\r\n  compacted soil.Â  Neither Haas nor Evans informed Respondents of the compaction\r\n  problem.Â  Â Â \r\nThe\r\n  finished concrete surface began showing signs of a major failure in 2000.Â \r\n  Respondents informed Haas of the failure.Â  Haas blamed the failure on the\r\n  sealant which had been applied to the concrete and promised to contact a\r\n  representative from the sealantâ€™s manufacturer.Â  This never occurred.Â  Instead,\r\n  Haas â€œdropped the ballâ€ by doing nothing to remedy the problems.Â  Upon\r\n  realizing the problems with the concrete would not be corrected, Respondents\r\n  hired a contractor to remedy the problems and initiated this action in 2001.Â \r\n \r\nThis\r\n  matter came before the trial court for a non-jury trial on January 19, 2006.Â \r\n  By order dated March 16, 2006, the trial court granted judgment for the\r\n  Respondents against Q.L. Evans; Q.L. Evans Construction Company; Mike Hass; and\r\n  Palmetto Construction Company jointly and severely in the amount of $154,299.15,\r\n  which represented the $151,803.36 Respondents spent to repair and replace the\r\n  concrete and $2,495.79 in lost profits due to business interruptions.Â  The\r\n  trial court, in its order, specifically found: â€œAs the soil under the concrete\r\n  was improperly compacted there is nothing [Respondents] could have done to\r\n  prevent failure other than to replace the concrete which they did.â€ Â Appellant\r\n  then filed a motion pursuant Rule 59, SCRCP, based on the failure of the trial\r\n  court to reduce judgment on behalf of Respondents for failing to mitigate their\r\n  damages.Â  The trial court denied this motion and reiterated the fact that Respondents\r\n  â€œcould not have done anything reasonable to mitigate damages.â€Â  This\r\n  appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  reasonableness of actions to mitigate damages is ordinarily a question for the\r\n  finder of fact.Â  McClary v. Massey Ferguson, Inc., 291 S.C. 506, 511,\r\n  354 S.E.2d 405, 408&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1987).\r\n\r\n\tIn an\r\n  action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact\r\n  of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without\r\n  evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings. The rule is the same\r\n  whether the judgeâ€™s findings are made with or without, a reference. The judgeâ€™s\r\n  findings are equivalent to a juryâ€™s findings in a law action.\r\n\r\nÂ Townes Associates, Ltd.\r\n  v. City of Greenville,&nbsp; 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773,\r\n  775&nbsp;(1976) (citing Chapman v. Allstate Ins. Co., 263 S.C. 565, 211\r\n  S.E.2d 876 (1974)). Â â€œIn a law case tried without a jury, questions regarding\r\n  the credibility and the weight of evidence are exclusively for the trial\r\n  judge.â€Â  Wayne Smith Const. Co., Inc. v. Wolman, Duberstein, and Thompson,\r\n  294 S.C. 140, 146, 363 S.E.2d 115, 118&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1987).Â  Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellant argues the trial courted erred by refusing to reduce the\r\n  judgment amount due to an alleged failure on the part of Respondents to\r\n  mitigate their damages.Â  We find no error in the trial courtâ€™s ruling on this\r\n  issue.\r\nâ€œA\r\n  party injured by the acts of another is required to do those things a person of\r\n  ordinary prudence would do under the circumstances to mitigate damages;\r\n  however, the law does not require unreasonable exertion or substantial expense\r\n  for this to be accomplished.â€Â  Genovese v. Bergeron, 327 S.C. 567, 572,\r\n  490 S.E.2d 608, 611&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997).Â  Furthermore, â€œthe law does not require\r\n  him to unreasonably exert himself or to incur substantial expense to avoid\r\n  damages.â€Â  Tri-Continental Leasing Corp. v. Stevens, Stevens &amp; Thomas,\r\n    P.A., 287 S.C. 338, 342, 338 S.E.2d 343, 346&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1985).Â  â€œThe party who claims damages should have been minimized\r\n  has the burden of proving they could reasonably have been avoided or reduced.â€Â  Id.\r\nAppellant argues a reduction was required because Respondentâ€™s\r\n  witnesses testified that delay between discovery of the problems and remedial\r\n  action worsened the damage and that Appellant offered to fix problems in 2000\r\n  for â€œa price which was more than $110,000 less than what the Respondent\r\n  ultimately paid.â€ Â Appellant testified that the problems with the concrete were\r\n  caused by the defective soil conditions and that only way to fix the problem\r\n  would be to take the original concrete up and replace it.Â  Appellant also\r\n  testified that in July of 2000, before the condition of the concrete worsened\r\n  to its present state, he offered to fix the concrete for $45,000.00. Â This is\r\n  the only reference in the record to a specific amount the mitigation would have\r\n  cost Respondents.Â  Â In response to questions from the trial court regarding\r\n  this figure, Appellant stated the figure only included replacing the concrete\r\n  which was damaged at the time of his inspection in 2000 and additional damage\r\n  could still have occurred even if Respondent had utilized the services he\r\n  offered at that time.Â  Considering this testimony and the fact that Appellant\r\n  bore the burden of showing Respondents failed to mitigate their damages, we\r\n  find no error in the trial courtâ€™s ruling on this issue.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the\r\n  reasons stated above, the order of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, SHORT, and WILLIAMS JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Installing concrete over soft soil\r\n  typically results in severe cracking in the finished concrete surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-028","title":"Barr v.

Calvy, of Kingstree, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In a\r\n  decision affirmed by the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission\r\n  (Appellate Panel) and the circuit court, the single commissioner found Doris\r\n  Barr sustained an injury due to repetitive trauma at Williamsburg School\r\n  District and was entitled to temporary total benefits and compensation for\r\n  medical treatment related to Barrâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation injury.Â  Williamsburg  School District and South Carolina School Boards Insurance Trust (Appellants)\r\n  appeal and we affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nDoris Barr (Barr) began working for Williamsburg County School District (Employer) as a food service operator in the school cafeteria in 1995.\r\n  Her duties varied but included scrubbing pans, lifting bags of ingredients,\r\n  thawing meat, and baking in preparation to feed over 700 students.  \r\nIn 2000 or 2001, Barr began experiencing tingling and numbness in\r\n  her fingers. In June 2001 she was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome but\r\n  continued to work in the cafeteria. Barrâ€™s pain had increased and progressed up\r\n  both hands by the time she saw Dr. Gheraibeh on January 30, 2003. The next day\r\n  Dr. Gheraibeh performed carpal tunnel release surgery on Barrâ€™s left hand. Â On\r\n  February 19, 2003, she underwent the same surgery on her right hand. Â Barr\r\n  continued to suffer from pain and numbness after the surgeries.Â   \r\nAlthough Barr had previously complained about her hands to her\r\n  co-workers and the cafeteriaâ€™s assistant manager, Barr did not file a Form-50\r\n  requesting workersâ€™ compensation until May 8, 2003. The single commissioner\r\n  awarded Barr temporary total benefits for the period of January 30 to December\r\n  30, 2003. The Appellate Panel affirmed.Â  Appellants appealed to the circuit\r\n  court which found substantial evidence supported the Appellate Panelâ€™s findings\r\n  of fact and the Appellate Panel did not err in any matters of law. Â Appellants\r\n  appeal.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\nSouth Carolina Code section 1-23-380(A)(6) governs our\r\n  review of workersâ€™ compensation decisions.&nbsp; Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 454-55, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).&nbsp; â€œIn an appeal from the Commission, this Court may not\r\n  substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of the\r\n  evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where the decision is affected\r\n  by an error of law.â€ Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 617, 571 S.E.2d\r\n  92, 95 (Ct. App. 2002) â€œThe findings of an administrative agency are\r\n  presumed correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial\r\n  evidence.â€ Id.Â  Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of\r\n  evidence, but is evidence that, considering the record as a whole, would allow\r\n  reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the agency reached.&nbsp; McCraw v.\r\n    Mary Black Hosp., 350 S.C. 229, 235, 565 S.E.2d 286, 289 (2002).&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1. Appellants claim the\r\n  Appellate Panelâ€™s finding that Barr sustained repetitive trauma to her right\r\n  and left upper extremities is not supported by substantial evidence.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Appellants claim Barrâ€™s activities at the cafeteria were neither repetitive nor\r\n  traumatic.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder Section 42-1-160 of the South Carolina Code (2007), a claimant is entitled to benefits for an\r\n  â€œinjury by accident arising out of and in the course of employment.â€ Pee v.\r\n    AVM, Inc., 352 S.C. 167, 170, 573 S.E.2d 785, 787 (2002). In interpreting\r\n  â€œinjury by accident,â€ the Supreme Court has held that no mishap was required\r\n  for an accident so long as there was an unexpected injury occurring while the\r\n  employee was performing his usual duties in his customary manner. Id. at 171, 573 S.E.2d at 787;Â  See, e.g., Colvin v. E.I. DuPont De Nemours Co., 227 S.C. 465, 88 S.E.2d 581 (1955) (injury by\r\n  accident is an injury occurring unexpectedly without the prior occurrence of\r\n  any external event of an accidental nature); Hiers v. Brunson Const. Co., 221 S.C. 212, 70 S.E.2d 211 (1952) (injury by\r\n  accident is an injury that is accidental in that it is unforeseen and\r\n  unexpected). â€œThe focus is not on some specific event, but rather on the injury\r\n  itself.â€ Stokes v. First Nat'l Bank, 306 S.C. 46, 50, 410 S.E.2d 248, 250 (1991).\r\n  If an injury is unexpected from the worker's point of view, it qualifies as an\r\n  injury by accident. Pee at 171, 573 S.E.2d at 787.\r\nThe Appellate Panel found Barr sustained repetitive trauma to her\r\n  right and left upper extremities, including trigger thumbs and cyst, and such\r\n  injury arose out of and in the course of her employment as a food service\r\n  operator for Employer. Barr prepared food, served food, cleaned, and stocked\r\n  shelves, job duties which â€œrequired repetitive use of her hands.â€ Â The Appellate\r\n  Panel concluded Barr sustained thirty-five percent loss of use to each the\r\n  right and left upper extremity. In finding Barr suffered a temporary total\r\n  disability caused by her course of employment, the Appellate Panel relied upon\r\n  testimony from Barr and deposition testimony from Dr. Gheraibeh concerning\r\n  causation, treatment, and maximum medical improvement.Â   \r\nBarr testified that she began noticing numbness and tingling in\r\n  her fingers in 2000 or 2001. She continued to work but as time passed the pain\r\n  and numbness progressed to her hands, her wrists became sore, and she could not\r\n  maintain a grip on objects in her hands. Â Barr also described the\r\n  â€œbaking, mopping,â€¦ scrubbing, lifting, stocking, and servingâ€ required by her\r\n  job. She testified she worked with three other women to prepare meals for 700\r\n  to 800 students. While the kitchen tasks rotated every week, Barr still\r\n  repeated such tasks over and over again during the course of her employment. In\r\n  addition, the tasks all required use of her hands in a repetitive motion as she\r\n  made numerous biscuits, pulled apart frozen chickens, and washed dishes every\r\n  day. Barr worked seven hours a day, five days a week during the school\r\n  year for six years in the school cafeteria.  \r\nDr. Gheraibeh testified Barr came to him after suffering from\r\n  numbness in both hands for several years. Â Dr. Gheraibeh explained that\r\n  he performed carpal tunnel release surgery on both of Barrâ€™s hands since\r\n  surgery is more effective than Barrâ€™s previous treatment of splinting.[2] Â Dr. Gheraibeh testified the\r\n  carpal tunnel release surgeries would â€œnot cure the damage already done to the\r\n  nerve,â€ but was intended to â€œprevent the condition from getting worse.â€  \r\nAlthough Barr reached maximum medical improvement regarding her\r\n  carpal tunnel syndrome in April 2003, Barr also suffered from trigger thumb.\r\n  Dr. Gheraibeh performed trigger thumb release surgery on Barrâ€™s left hand in\r\n  June 2003.[3] Â Dr. Gheraibeh testified that it is difficult to conclude the pain in\r\n  Barrâ€™s thumb is separate from carpal tunnel syndrome since â€œthe thumb is\r\n  involved in the carpal tunnel.â€ In August of 2003, Dr. Gheraibeh also diagnosed\r\n  Barr as suffering from cervical strain and neck pain. Dr. Gheraibeh testified\r\n  that the pain â€œis all connectedâ€ as the nerve that runs through the carpal\r\n  tunnel in the wrist continues up the neck. Dr. Gheraibeh found Barr reached\r\n  maximum medical improvement in December 2003.  \r\nDr. Gheraibeh testified that Barrâ€™s carpal tunnel syndrome was\r\n  caused by â€œrepeated forceful flexion of the wrist and fingers.â€ He described\r\n  the â€œcombination of force and repetition and postureâ€ present in food\r\n  processing work as the source of Barrâ€™s repetitive trauma.[4] Accordingly, we find substantial\r\n  evidence in the record to support the Appellate Panelâ€™s finding that Barrâ€™s\r\n  injuries to both her right and left upper extremities arose out of repetitive\r\n  trauma in the course of her employment.Â   \r\n2.&nbsp; Appellants claim the\r\n  Appellate Panel erred in failing to make a detailed finding with respect to the\r\n  statutory notice requirement.Â  More specifically, Appellants claim Barr did not\r\n  give timely notice as required by South Carolina Code Section 42-15-20.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe Appellate\r\n  Panel found the last date of exposure was January 30, 2003, and â€œthe claimant\r\n  gave notice to employer within ninety days.â€ The South Carolina Supreme Court\r\n  has held, â€œ[t]he findings of fact of an\r\n  administrative body must be sufficiently detailed to enable the reviewing court\r\n  to determine whether the findings are supported by the evidence and whether the\r\n  law has been properly applied to those findings.â€ Heater of Seabrook, Inc.\r\n    v. Public Service Comâ€™n of South Carolina, 332 S.C. 20, 26, 503 S.E.2d 739,\r\n  742 (1998).Â  With a simple review of the record on appeal this court was able\r\n  to determine the Appellate Panelâ€™s finding is sufficiently supported by evidence\r\n  from Employerâ€™s own records.  \r\nOn March 19, 2003, Employer stamped a â€œCertification of Physician\r\n  or Practitionerâ€ form as received by their personnel department. The form\r\n  includes Barrâ€™s name, her treating physician, and the diagnosis of bilateral\r\n  carpal tunnel syndrome. The form also notes the carpal tunnel syndrome\r\n  commenced â€œseveral years agoâ€ and that Barr is currently not able to work.\r\n  Accordingly, we find substantial evidence in the record to support the Appellate\r\n  Panelâ€™s finding that Barr gave notice to Employer within the statutorily\r\n  required ninety days.[5]  \r\nIn Bass\r\n  v. Isochem, this court found that â€œSection 42-15-20 provides no specific\r\n  method of giving notice, the object being that the employer be actually put on\r\n  notice of the injury so he can investigate it immediately after its occurrence\r\n  and can furnish medical care for the employee.â€ 365 S.C. 454, 473, 617 S.E.2d\r\n  369, 379 (Ct. App. 2005). The requirement of notice is not a mere formality and\r\n  the burden is upon the claimant to show compliance with the notice provision. Id.Â  A repetitive trauma injury, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, has a gradual onset\r\n  caused by the cumulative effect of repetitive traumatic events or\r\n  â€œmini-accidents.â€Â  Schulknight v. City of North Charleston, 352 S.C.\r\n  175, 178, 574, S.E.2d 194, 195 (2002).Â  The exact date an accident occurs is\r\n  difficult to ascertain in a repetitive trauma case because there is no definite\r\n  time of injury. Id.Â   \r\nAlthough\r\n  Barr did not file a workerâ€™s compensation commission Form 50 until May 8, 2003,\r\n  Barr testified she previously informed her immediate supervisor and assistant\r\n  manager, Hurley McMillian, that she was hurting. â€œWhen there is some knowledge\r\n  of accompanying facts connecting the injury or illness with the employment, and\r\n  signifying to a reasonably conscientious supervisor that the case might involve\r\n  a potential compensation claim,â€ then notice is adequate. Bass at\r\n  473-74, 617 S.E.2d at 379.Â  Accordingly, we find Barr gave adequate notice to\r\n  Employer.Â   \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J.,\r\n  KITTREDGE and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Before Barr sought\r\n  treatment with Dr. Gheraibeh, she saw Dr. Healy in Florence in June 2001. Dr.\r\n  Healy diagnosed Barrâ€™s carpal tunnel syndrome and prescribed pain medication\r\n  and the use of splints on Barrâ€™s wrists. When he first saw her in January 2003,\r\n  Dr. Gheraibeh was aware of Barrâ€™s previous treatments and that her pain\r\n  continued to increase.  \r\n[3] Barr elected not to have\r\n  the recommended trigger thumb release surgery on her right hand.  \r\n[4] Dr. Gheraibeh denied Barrâ€™s\r\n  carpal tunnel syndrome or trigger thumb had any relation to an incident in the\r\n  Spring of 2001 when the back of Barrâ€™s hand was popped by a mixer.  \r\n[5] South Carolina Code Section 42-15-20 provides that\r\n  â€œ[e]very injured employee or his representative shall immediately on the\r\n  occurrence of an accident, or as soon thereafter as practicable, give or cause\r\n  to be given to the employer a notice of the accidentâ€ and â€œ[n]o compensation shall be payable unless such notice is given\r\n  within ninety days after the occurrence of the accident.â€ S.C.

Zelenka,\r\n  Assistant Attorney General, Melody J. Brown, of Columbia; and Solicitor Harold\r\n  W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg; for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In\r\n  February 2006, Arthur Shane Beck was tried and convicted of murder.Â  He was\r\n  sentenced to life in prison.Â  Beck timely appeals his conviction contending the\r\n  trial court erred by refusing to give the jury a charge on self-defense.Â  We\r\n  affirm.[1]  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn July 6, 2004, Appellant Beck went to the Kangaroo Truck Stop in\r\n  Gaffney, bought a six-pack of beer, and proceeded to the side of the\r\n  establishment where he lay in wait for Ray VonCannon (VonCannon). As Ray\r\n  VonCannon got off work at the truck stop and exited the building, Beck\r\n  confronted him.  \r\nBeardslee, a customer at the truck stop, noticed the two men\r\n  arguing as he went into the store. Â As\r\n  Beardslee exited the store he again noticed the two men arguing and pushing.\r\n  Beardslee continued to his automobile but turned around when he heard one man\r\n  yell â€œstop, quit, donâ€™t do that again, stop.â€ Beardslee turned to see Beck stabbing VonCannon with a long\r\n  aluminum knife. VonCannon died as a result of the stab wounds.  \r\nBeck fled the scene but was followed by Beardslee and eventually\r\n  apprehended close to the truck stop by the police. Beck gave a statement to the\r\n  police in which he indicated VonCannonâ€™s wife and her daughter, Beckâ€™s former\r\n  girlfriend, made him stab VonCannon. Â A long aluminum knife, closed box\r\n  cutter, and keys were found at the scene. In addition, blood samples taken from\r\n  Beckâ€™s jeans matched VonCannonâ€™s DNA.  \r\nBeck was indicted for murder. Before trial commenced, medical experts\r\n  found Beck had a low IQ and mild mental retardation but was competent to stand\r\n  trial. Â Beck requested the trial court instruct the jury on the law of\r\n  self-defense.Â  The trial court denied the request for a self-defense charge. A\r\n  jury found Beck guilty of murder and he was sentenced to life in prison. Â Beck\r\n  now appeals.  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn review of a jury charge, an appellate court considers the\r\n  charge as a whole in view of the evidence and issues presented at trial. State\r\n    v. Lee-Grigg, 374 S.C. 388, 406, 649 S.E.2d 41, 50 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  The\r\n  evidence presented at trial determines the law to be charged. State v.\r\n    Wigington, 375 S.C. 25, 30, 649 S.E.2d 185, 187 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  â€œA trial\r\n  court commits reversible error if it fails to give a requested charge on an\r\n  issue raised by the evidence.â€ Lee-Grigg, at 406, 649 S.E.2d at 50.Â  If\r\n  there is any evidence in the record to support self-defense, the issue should\r\n  be submitted to the jury. State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 260, 565\r\n  S.E.2d 298, 302 (2002).Â  â€œA self-defense charge is not required unless the\r\n  evidence supports it.â€ State v. Bryant, 336 S.C. 340, 344, 520 S.E.2d\r\n  319, 321 (1999).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellant\r\n  Beck argues the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the law\r\n  of self-defense.Â  Specifically, Beck argues mutual shoving and a closed box\r\n  cutter found on the scene could allow the jury to conclude that after Beck\r\n  confronted VonCannon, VonCannon pulled out a box cutter and Beck responded by\r\n  pulling out a knife and stabbing VonCannon.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo establish self defense in South Carolina, there must be\r\n  evidence: (1) appellant was without fault in bringing on the difficulty; (2)\r\n  appellant actually believed he was in imminent danger of losing his life or\r\n  sustaining serious bodily injury; (3) a reasonable, prudent person of ordinary\r\n  fitness and courage would have entertained the same belief; and (4) appellant\r\n  had no other probable means of avoiding the danger. State v. Santiago, 370 S.C. 153, 159, 634 S.E.2d 23, 26 (Ct. App. 2006); State v. Chatman,\r\n  336 S.C. 149, 153, 519 S.E.2d 100, 102 (1999).  \r\nHere, the record does not support a charge of self-defense for\r\n  several reasons.Â  First, the evidence does not support a finding that Beck was\r\n  without fault in bringing on the difficulty. Â In a statement Beck gave to the\r\n  police the night he was apprehended, Beck explained he agreed to stab VonCannon\r\n  at the request of VonCannonâ€™s wife and her daughter. Â Armed with a long\r\n  knife, Beck went to the truck stop where VonCannon worked, bought beer, and\r\n  went behind dumpsters to the side of the store where he drank four beers and\r\n  smoked cigarettes while waiting for VonCannon. As VonCannon exited the store at\r\n  nine oâ€™clock, Beck approached VonCannon. A witness testified he saw the two men\r\n  arguing and pushing before VonCannon yelled out as he was being stabbed by\r\n  Beck. Â â€œOne who provokes or initiates an assault cannot escape criminal\r\n  liability by invoking self-defense.â€ State v. Bryant, 336 S.C. 340, 345,\r\n  520 S.E.2d 319, 322 (1999), quoting Ferdinand S. Tinio, Comment Note:\r\n    Withdrawal, After Provocation of Conflict, As Reviving Right Of Self-Defense,\r\n  55 A.L.R. 3d, 1000, 1003 (1974).Â  Beckâ€™s conduct in arming himself with a knife\r\n  and laying in wait to confront VonCannon could be reasonably understood as calculated\r\n  to create the volatile and ultimately deadly situation.Â  State v.\r\n    Cabrera-Pena, 361 S.C. 372, 383-84, 605 S.E.2d 522, 528 (2004).  \r\nThe record does not support a finding that Beck believed he was in\r\n  imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury.Â  Beck\r\n  argues â€œthe jury could take the view of the case that Mr. Beck confronted Mr.\r\n  VonCannnon, that Mr. VonCannon responded by pulling out a box cutter, and that\r\n  Mr. Beck responded by pulling out a knife.â€ The box cutter found at the scene\r\n  of the stabbing was closed â€œwith the blade still inside.â€ Although a\r\n  witness saw Beck stab VonCannon with a long knife, there was no evidence\r\n  VonCannon ever pulled out a box cutter or that the box cutter even belonged to\r\n  VonCannon.  \r\nLastly, the record does not support a finding that Beck had no\r\n  other means of avoiding the danger.Â  Beck confronted VonCannon in the parking\r\n  lot of a truck stop. If Beck truly wanted to withdraw from the confrontation,\r\n  he could have easily left the open parking lot. Bryant at 346, 520\r\n  S.E.2d at 322.Â   \r\nAccordingly, the trial court correctly found Beck was not entitled\r\n  to a self-defense charge.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J.,\r\n  KITTREDGE and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-030","title":"In the Interest of Christopher C.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayUnPubOpinion.cfm?caseNo=2008-UP-030","description":null,"date":"2008-01-10","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS OPINION HAS NO\r\n  PRECEDENTIAL VALUE.Â  IT SHOULD NOT BE CITED OR RELIED ON AS PRECEDENT IN ANY\r\n  PROCEEDING EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY RULE 239(d)(2), SCACR.\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Interest of\r\n      Christopher C., A Minor Under the Age of Seventeen Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Dillon County\r\nTimothy L.

Smith, Jr., of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tTimothy Lee Mills, Chester, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Attorney\r\n  Fletcher N. Smith, Jr. appeals from a decision by the Resolution of Fee\r\n  Disputes Board ordering him to return a portion of his retainer fee to Timothy\r\n  Mills.Â  The circuit court affirmed the decision by the Board requiring Smith to\r\n  refund $1,900 of his $2,500 fee to Mills.Â  Smith appeals the decision.Â  We\r\n  dismiss.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nTimothy Mills, or someone on his behalf, paid Fletcher Smith a\r\n  retainer fee of $2,500 on October 26, 2001.Â  Though there was no written\r\n  agreement, it was understood that Smith would file a Motion For Reconsideration\r\n  for Mills in this criminal case.Â  He had been sentenced on August 15, 2001.Â  \r\n \r\nUnder Rule 29 (a) SCRCP, any motion to reconsider must be filed\r\n  within 10 days of sentencing and Smith was not hired until more than 30 days\r\n  had elapsed.Â  Mills wanted a refund of his fee to Smith because he should have\r\n  been told by Smith that it was too late to file a Motion to Reconsider. Â \r\nThe Fee Disputes Board found that though the money was actually\r\n  paid by Millsâ€™ girlfriend and there was no fee agreement that a portion of the\r\n  fee should be returned to Mills.Â  The Board calculated that Smith should retain\r\n  $600 and refund $1,900 to Mills.Â  Smith appealed the decision to the circuit\r\n  court where it was affirmed.Â   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSmith\r\n  argues the trial court should have considered South Carolina Code Section\r\n  40-5-390 and vacated the Fee Disputes Boardâ€™s decision.Â  This court, however,\r\n  lacks jurisdiction to review this appeal.Â  In Rule 416 SCACR Rule 20, it states\r\n  that â€œa party may appeal the final\r\n  decision of the Board to the circuit court.â€ No other avenue of appeal is set\r\n  forth in the rule.Â  A very straight forward process is set forth with review by\r\n  the Board and appeal to the circuit court only.Â  In Wright v. Dickey, 370 S.C. 517, 521,\r\n  636 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2006), this court stated â€œthere is no appeal from a decision\r\n  of the Resolution of Fee Disputes Board of the South Carolina Bar beyond the\r\n  circuit court as set forth in Rule 416, SCACR, Rule 20.â€Â  Therefore, this court\r\n  has no jurisdiction for this appeal.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude that there is no appeal from the South Carolina\r\n  Resolution of Fee Disputes Board beyond the circuit court.Â  Therefore this\r\n  appeal is dismissed.\r\nDISMISSED.\r\nHUFF and\r\n  PIEPER, JJ., and GOOLSBY, AJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-033","title":"State v.

Smith, Jr., of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tMarshall H. Waldron, Jr., of Bluffton, for\r\n  Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Charles\r\n  Brown (Brown) appeals the granting of summary judgment for the respondents\r\n  arguing that the South Carolina Tort Claims Act (SCTCA) does not preclude a\r\n  claim for malicious prosecution solely because the cause of action includes the\r\n  element of malice.Â  He also alleges that the statute of limitations on his negligent\r\n  hiring cause of action did not begin to run until after the last act of\r\n  tortious conduct, i.e., the malicious prosecution, as opposed to the alleged\r\n  unlawful arrest.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  April 17, 2001, Brown entered Heilig Meyers, a retail furniture store located\r\n  in Orangeburg, wherein a confrontation occurred between Brown and the store\r\n  employees. Â During the confrontation, a Heilig Meyersâ€™ employee called the\r\n  Sheriffâ€™s Department.Â  As Brown began to leave the store, he was met at the\r\n  door by Deputy Winston Leonard (Leonard) of the Orangeburg County Sheriffâ€™s\r\n  Department (hereinafter referred to as â€œSheriffâ€™s Departmentâ€).Â  Deputy Leonard\r\n  interviewed the employees at the store and learned that Brown allegedly assaulted\r\n  and battered a store employee.Â  At that point Leonard placed Brown under arrest\r\n  for assault and battery. Â The charges against Brown were nolle prossed on\r\n  November 3, 2003.\r\nBrown filed this\r\n  action on April 21, 2005, and attempted to serve it on the Sheriffâ€™s Department\r\n  on April 22, 2005.Â  Brown alleges that the respondents maliciously prosecuted\r\n  him and that the Sheriffâ€™s Department was grossly negligent in hiring and supervising\r\n  Leonard.\r\nOn March 22, 2006,\r\n  the respondents filed their motion for summary judgment based upon Brownâ€™s\r\n  failure to state a claim for which relief could be granted and that the court\r\n  lacked personal jurisdiction over them.Â  The court granted summary judgment for\r\n  the respondents.Â  This appeal follows.  \r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nWhen\r\n  reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard of review as the trial court\r\n  under Rule 56, SCRCP. Cowburn v. Leventis, 366 S.C. 20, 30, 619\r\n  S.E.2d 437, 443 (Ct. App. 2005). Summary judgment\r\n  is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving\r\n  party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Â To\r\n  determine whether any triable issues of fact exist, the reviewing court must\r\n  consider the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable\r\n  to the non-moving party. Law v. S.C. Dep't of Corrections, 368\r\n  S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648 (2006).\r\nâ€œ[W]hen plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist\r\n  on which reasonable minds cannot differ, summary judgment should be granted.â€ Ellis\r\n    v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 518, 595 S.E.2d 817, 822 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\n  Â However, â€œ[s]ummary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the\r\n  facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.â€ Bennett\r\n    v. Investors Title Ins. Co., 370 S.C. 578, 588, 635 S.E.2d 649, 654\r\n  (Ct. App. 2006). Â â€œEven when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, but\r\n  only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them, summary\r\n  judgment should be denied.â€ Nelson v. Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Comm'n, 362 S.C. 1, 5, 605 S.E.2d 744, 746 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBrown\r\n  argues that the circuit court erred in finding the Sheriffâ€™s Department is\r\n  immune from liability on the malicious prosecution cause of action due to S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§15-78-60(17) (Supp. 2003) of SCTCA since the tort includes the\r\n  element of malice.Â  That section of the statute provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  governmental entity is not liable for a loss resulting from:(17) employee conduct outside the scope of his official duties or which constitutes actual fraud, actual malice, intent to harm, or a\r\n  crime involving moral turpitude.\r\n\r\nA strict reading of the\r\n  statute indicates that a cause of action based upon conduct of an employee\r\n  containing the element of malice cannot be maintained against the Sheriffâ€™s Department.Â \r\n  In order to maintain an action for malicious prosecution, Brown must prove the\r\n  following: 1) the institution or continuation of original judicial proceedings,\r\n  either civil or criminal; 2) by, or at the instance of the respondents; 3)\r\n  termination of such proceedings in Brownâ€™s favor; 4) respondentsâ€™ malice in\r\n  instituting such proceedings; 5) lack of probable cause; and 6) resulting\r\n  injury or damage.Â  Jordan v. Deese, 317 S.C. 260, 262, 452 S.E.2d\r\n  838, 839 (1995).Â  â€œTo maintain a cause of action for malicious prosecution,\r\n  plaintiff must prove malice in instituting the proceedings.â€Â  Pritchett v.\r\n    Lanier, 766 F.Supp. 442, 453 (D.S.C. 1991) (citing Ruff v. Eckerd Drugs,\r\n      Inc., 265 S.C. 563, 220 S.E.2d 649 (1975).Â  The aforementioned statutory\r\n  immunity from claims that require a showing of actual malice was applied in Gause\r\n    v. Doe, 317 S.C. 39, 451 S.E.2d 408 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  In that case, this\r\n  court held that a cause of action for slander could not be maintained under\r\n  SCTCA due to the fact that a mandatory element of the cause of action required\r\n  a showing of malice. Id., 317 S.C. at 41-42, 451 S.E.2d at 409.Â   \r\nBrown\r\n  asserts that Law v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corrections, 368 S.C. 424, 629 S.E.2d\r\n  642 (2006), stands for a contrary proposition.Â  However, the trial court\r\n  properly distinguished that case from the one at hand because in Law the\r\n  court never addressed the malice immunity.Â  Since the defense was not raised in Law and was not considered by the court, Law is not dispositive\r\n  precedent on the issue.Â  Hutto v. Southern Farm Bureau Life Ins. Co., 259 S.C. 170, 173, 191 S.E.2d 7, 8 (1972) (â€œIt is, of course, settled law that\r\n  â€˜a case cannot be considered as a binding precedent on a\r\n  legal point that was not argued in the case and not mentioned in the opinion.â€™â€).\r\n  Â Therefore, in the case at hand, the trial court properly granted summary\r\n  judgment for the Sheriffâ€™s Department as to Brownâ€™s claim for malicious\r\n  prosecution.\r\nHowever, the\r\n  malicious prosecution claim, as it pertains to Deputy Leonard, is not entitled\r\n  to the same analysis.Â  Although the Sheriffâ€™s Department is entitled to\r\n  statutory immunity from claims requiring a showing of malice, individual\r\n  employees are not entitled to benefit from that same immunity. Â Otherwise,\r\n  employees of organizations covered by SCTCA would have immunity from any\r\n  intentional tort.Â  This concern was clearly considered by our legislature and\r\n  is resolved by Â§ 15-78-70(b) which provides an exception for certain actions on\r\n  the part of governmental employees:\r\n\r\n\tNothing\r\n  in this chapter may be construed to give an employee of a governmental entity\r\n  immunity from suit and liability if it is proved that the employeeâ€™s conduct\r\n  was not within the scope of his official duties or that it constituted\r\n  actual fraud, actual malice, intent to harm, or a crime involving moral\r\n  turpitude. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-70(b)\r\n  (Supp. 2003) (emphasis added).Â  Therefore, claims against such employees for\r\n  torts which include these elements are not maintained under SCTCA but are\r\n  pursued privately against the individual tortfeasor.Â  The SCTCA provides the\r\n  â€œexclusive civil remedy available for any tort committed by a governmental\r\n  entity, its employees, or its agents except as provided in Section\r\n    15-78-70(b).â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-20(b) (Supp. 2003) (emphasis added).Â  Thus,\r\n  the circuit court erred in dismissing the malicious prosecution claim against\r\n  Deputy Leonard based upon the same immunity granted to the Sheriffâ€™s\r\n  Department.\r\nHowever,\r\n  despite Brownâ€™s ability to pursue a claim against Leonard for malicious\r\n  prosecution, his claim nonetheless must fail since he has not demonstrated the\r\n  lack of probable cause as a matter of law.Â  â€œProbable cause,\r\n  which is a defense to an action for malicious prosecution, has been defined as â€˜the existence of such facts\r\n  or circumstances as would excite the belief of a reasonable mind, acting on\r\n  facts within the knowledge of the prosecutor, that the person charged was\r\n  guilty of the crime for which he was prosecuted.â€™â€ Lynch v. Toys &quot;R''\r\n    Us-Delaware, Inc., Op. No. 4316 (S.C. Ct. App. Filed Nov. 27, 2007)\r\n  (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 41 at 68) (quoting Ruff v. Eckerds Drugs, 265 S.C. 563, 568, 220 S.E.2d 649, 652 (1975)). Thus, as far as determining the\r\n  existence of probable cause, the\r\n  facts must be regarded from the point of view of the prosecuting party; the\r\n  question is not what the actual facts were, but what the prosecuting party\r\n  honestly believed them to be. Law, 368 S.C. at 436, 629 S.E.2d at\r\n  649. Â Although the question of whether probable cause exists is ordinarily a jury question, in an action for malicious prosecution, it may be\r\n  decided as a matter of law when the evidence yields but one conclusion. Id. Â \r\nHere,\r\n  Deputy Leonard acted with probable cause in arresting and procuring an arrest\r\n  warrant against Brown.Â  Deputy Leonard arrived at the scene soon after the incident\r\n  occurred and after the police were called to respond to the scene because of a\r\n  disturbance at the business.Â  The record shows that John Jordan and Sheila\r\n  Snell gave statements to Deputy Leonard alleging that Brown, without\r\n  provocation, punched Jordan in the face.Â  The deputy also indicated to the\r\n  magistrate issuing the warrant that there was swelling to the right side of\r\n  John Jordanâ€™s face. Â The magistrate ultimately found probable cause existed\r\n  upon issuance of the warrant. The existence of probable cause is apparent from\r\n  the record.Â  Again, we must decide probable cause based on the facts presented\r\n  to the deputy.Â  If the statements provided to the deputy were false or\r\n  incorrect, then potential liability exists as to those individuals who may have\r\n  provided any false or incorrect statements; however, such acts would not\r\n  diminish the existence of probable cause absent some basis for the deputy to\r\n  believe them to be false.Â  Brown has also filed a malicious prosecution claim\r\n  against John Jordan and Helig Meyers based upon their allegedly false assertion\r\n  that he committed an assault; those claims are not the subject of this appeal.Â \r\n  Therefore, the fact that the statements were made to the deputy suggests the existence\r\n  of probable cause as a matter of law.\r\nWhile\r\n  Brown asserts that Leonard did not see or observe Brown punching or assaulting\r\n  anyone, this assertion does not entitle Brown to maintain a malicious\r\n  prosecution action. Â The deputy provided statements under oath to the\r\n  magistrate about facts which suggested that a crime had been committed.Â  The\r\n  magistrate found probable cause that a crime had been committed.Â  On appeal,\r\n  Brown does not challenge the finding of probable cause by the magistrate.Â \r\n  Instead, the gravamen of Brownâ€™s claim is that the statements made were\r\n  allegedly false.Â  His inconsistent and conclusory allegation that no one\r\n  provided any statements to the deputy is unsupported by the record and the\r\n  record is lacking as to any basis upon which Brown acquired such personal\r\n  knowledge.Â  See, e.g., Lujan v. Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n, 497\r\n  U.S. 871, 888, 110 S.Ct. 3177, 3188 (1990) (â€œThe object of [Rule 56] is not to\r\n  replace conclusory allegations of the complaint or answer\r\n  with conclusory allegations of an affidavit.â€); Lavender v. Kurn, 327 U.S. 645, 653, 66 S.Ct. 740, 744 (1946)\r\n  (stating speculation and conjecture are not a substitute for probative facts); Zarecki\r\n    v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., 914 F.Supp. 1566, 1574 (N.D.Ill. 1996)\r\n  (â€œAn affidavit that does not set forth the facts and\r\n  reasoning used in making a conclusion amounts to nothing more than a denial of\r\n  the adverse party's pleading.â€).Â  Indeed, the only evidence of record is that\r\n  the statements were made to the deputy outside of Brownâ€™s presence. Â Moreover,\r\n  the only argument made to the court appeared in Brownâ€™s brief and asserted only\r\n  that the warrant, without more, is not enough to establish probable cause.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  a claim for malicious prosecution may not be maintained against Leonard under\r\n  these circumstances.Â  Law enforcement must be free to reasonably act under the\r\n  circumstances presented without fear of the filing of a lawsuit absent any\r\n  evidence of wrongdoing or improper conduct.\r\nIn addition, Brown\r\n  did not establish Leonardâ€™s malice in instituting the judicial proceedings.Â  Malice\r\n  is defined as â€œthe deliberate intentional doing of an act without just cause or\r\n  excuse.â€ Law, at 437, 629 S.E.2d at 649 (quoting Eaves v. Broad River\r\n    Elec. Co-op., Inc., 277 S.C. 475, 479, 289 S.E.2d 414, 416 (1982)). Â \r\n\r\n\tMalice\r\n  does not necessarily mean a defendant acted out of spite, revenge, or with a\r\n  malignant disposition, although such an attitude certainly may indicate malice.\r\n  Malice also may proceed from an ill-regulated mind which is not sufficiently cautious\r\n  before causing injury to another person. Moreover, malice may be implied where\r\n  the evidence reveals a disregard of the consequences of an injurious act,\r\n  without reference to any special injury that may be inflicted on another\r\n  person. Malice also may be implied in the doing of an illegal act for one's own\r\n  gratification or purpose without regard to the rights of others or the injury\r\n  which may be inflicted on another person. In an action for malicious\r\n  prosecution, malice may be inferred from a lack of probable cause to institute\r\n  the prosecution. \r\n\r\nLaw, at 437, 629 S.E.2d at 649 (citing Margolis v.\r\n  Telech, 239 S.C. 232, 122 S.E.2d 417, 420 (1961)).\r\nLeonard was\r\n  investigating a complaint of an assault and battery, took witness statements\r\n  and observed the evidence on the scene.Â  In so doing, Leonard made the\r\n  determination that there was probable cause to institute judicial proceedings\r\n  against Brown for assault and battery.Â  Brown has failed to establish by\r\n  competent facts that at any time Leonard lacked probable cause or was operating\r\n  with malice.Â Â   \r\nFinally, Brown\r\n  argues that his negligent hiring and supervision claim, as opposed to the\r\n  malicious prosecution claim, was improperly barred based on the statute of\r\n  limitations.Â  Brown alleges that the statute of limitations should not have\r\n  begun to run on his claims for negligent hiring and supervision until his\r\n  charges were nolle prossed on November 3, 2003.Â  The trial judge in his order\r\n  granting summary judgment found that the statute of limitations on that claim\r\n  began to run on April 17, 2001, the date of his arrest.Â  The trial judge\r\n  concluded that upon his arrest Brown knew, or should have known by the exercise\r\n  of reasonable diligence, that the cause of action existed.Â  Epstein v. Brown,\r\n  363 S.C. 372, 380, 610 S.E.2d 816, 820 (2005).Â  We agree with this conclusion.Â \r\n  A negligence action arising after April 5, 1988, must be commenced within three\r\n  years â€œafter the person knew or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should\r\n  have known that he had a cause of action.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-535 (Supp. 1996); Christensen v. Mikell, 324 S.C. 70, 73, 476 S.E.2d 692, 694\r\n  (1996). Â â€œThe exercise of reasonable diligenceâ€ means that an injured party\r\n  must act promptly â€œwhere the facts and circumstances of an injury would put a\r\n  person of common knowledge and experience on notice that some right of his has\r\n  been invaded or that some claim against another party might exist.â€ Wiggins\r\n    v. Edwards, 314 S.C. 126, 128, 442 S.E.2d 169, 170 (1994) (quoting Snell\r\n      v. Columbia Gun Exchange, 276 S.C. 301, 303, 278 S.E.2d 333, 334\r\n  (1981)). Â Furthermore, in determining when the limitations period begins to\r\n  run, the proper focus is upon the date of discovery of the injury, not the date\r\n  of the discovery of the wrongdoer. Wiggins, 314 S.C. at 128, 442\r\n  S.E.2d at 170.Â  Regardless of whether the SCTCA two year statute of limitations\r\n  or the standard three year statute of limitations is applicable, Brownâ€™s claim\r\n  for negligent hiring and supervision was filed outside of either statute of\r\n  limitations.Â  Brown didnâ€™t file his complaint until April 22, 2005, four years\r\n  and five days after his time to file began to run.Â  Accordingly, although\r\n  Brownâ€™s claim for malicious prosecution was timely, the claim for negligent\r\n  hiring and supervision was properly dismissed for being untimely.[2]\r\nSince we ultimately\r\n  affirm the trial court on both issues presented, we need not address the\r\n  respondentsâ€™ contention that the court lacked personal jurisdiction due to\r\n  improper service of process. Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding that the court need not rule on remaining issues when\r\n  the disposition of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).[3]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nUpon a careful\r\n  review of the record, Brownâ€™s cause of action for negligent hiring and supervision\r\n  was properly dismissed as being untimely.Â  Further, SCTCA precludes Brown from\r\n  bringing a claim for malicious prosecution against the Orangeburg County\r\n  Sheriffâ€™s Department.Â  In addition, while the malicious prosecution claim\r\n  should not have been dismissed as to Deputy Leonard based upon the same\r\n  exception for malice Â available to the governmental entity under SCTCA, the\r\n  dismissal of the cause of action is nonetheless appropriate due to the\r\n  existence of probable cause as a matter of law.Â   \r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, the order of the trial court is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and PIEPER, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] No issue on appeal has been presented as to the\r\n  running of the statute of limitations on the malicious prosecution claim as it\r\n  was never addressed by the trial court due to dismissal of the claim under the\r\n  SCTCA.\r\n[3] Brown includes in his brief on appeal that he\r\n  also had an outstanding claim for false arrest.Â  However, no such claim appears\r\n  in his complaint and the argument was never presented to or ruled upon by the\r\n  trial court.Â  As such it is not preserved for us to review.Â  Floyd v.

Wells Dickson, Jr. \r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2008-UP-043\r\nHeard January 9, 2008 â€“ Filed January 11,\r\n  2008\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tScott L. Robinson, of Manning, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tFrances Ricci Land Welch, of Manning, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Danny\r\n  White appeals the special refereeâ€™s report denying his motion for a jury trial.Â \r\n  We affirm.Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nMarion Eadon, Jr., employed White as a\r\n  mechanic at his automotive dealership located in Manning, South Carolina.Â  While\r\n  White was employed by Eadon, White attempted to obtain financing from the National\r\n  Bank of South Carolina (the Bank) to purchase a mobile home, but was unsuccessful.Â \r\n  Consequently, White asked Eadon if he would be willing to generate a loan in his\r\n  name so White could purchase and finance a mobile home.Â  Â \r\nOn January 10, 2000, Eadon endorsed a note in the amount of\r\n  $49,536.00, the purchase price of the mobile home White selected.Â  White\r\n  then used the funds Eadon obtained from the Bank to purchase a mobile home.Â  The\r\n  security agreement accompanying the note provided a 2000 Fleetwood Heritage\r\n  Pointe Mobile Home, the one White obtained, as security for repayment of the\r\n  debt.Â  The Bank set up a third party pledge/hypothecation agreement allowing\r\n  Eadon to borrow money on collateral in Whiteâ€™s name.[1] Â The third party pledge signed\r\n  by White lists the mobile home as the collateral securing Eadonâ€™s debt under\r\n  the executed note and security agreement.Â  The loan was amortized for ten years\r\n  with a five year balloon.Â  The Bank held the title to the mobile home.\r\nSubsequently, White took possession\r\n  of the mobile home and initially made scheduled payments directly to the Bank.Â \r\n  However, when White and Eadonâ€™s employment relationship ended so did the\r\n  payments.Â  Gary Dennis, a loan officer for the Bank, testified the payment\r\n  history was â€œvery poorâ€ and White was aware payments were past due.Â  When White\r\n  failed to make payments, the Bank drafted the payments directly from Eadonâ€™s\r\n  account with the Bank.Â  Eadon testified he paid in excess of $5,000.00 in late\r\n  payments.Â  The balloon payment became due on January 15, 2005. Â According to\r\n  Eadon, the Bank required the loan to be paid in full since previous attempts were\r\n  unsuccessful to bring the loan current under the terms of the contract.Â Â Â  Because\r\n  the Bank refused to renew the note, Eadon paid the remaining balance due,\r\n  $32,821.38, and the Bank reassigned the note and title to the mobile home to him.Â \r\n \r\nWhite does not dispute he was supposed to make the payments on the\r\n  note.Â  Rather, White contends the loan was for a ten-year period, and the Bank,\r\n  not Eadon, was to hold the collateral.Â  According to Whiteâ€™s testimony, Eadon\r\n  is wrongfully holding the title to the mobile home because the note was fully\r\n  paid. Â White also contends he intended to continue making monthly payments, but\r\n  is unable to do so because Eadon paid the balance due on the note.  \r\nAt the\r\n  time of the hearing, White remained in possession of the mobile home.Â  Prior to\r\n  the hearing, White made a motion for a jury trial.Â  Following Eadonâ€™s case-in-chief\r\n  and the close of all testimony, White renewed his motion for a jury trial and\r\n  moved for a directed verdict on all of Eadonâ€™s causes of actions.Â  Subsequently,\r\n  the special referee issued a report (1) denying Whiteâ€™s motion for a jury\r\n  trial; (2) finding the loan documents as a whole satisfied the statute of\r\n  frauds; (3) finding Â Eadon was entitled to the collection rights set forth in\r\n  the loan documents; (4) entering a judgment, on behalf of Eadon, against White;\r\n  and (5) entitling Eadon to enforce the judgment and take possession of the\r\n  mobile home.Â  This appeal followed.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn\r\n  appeal from the final judgment of a master or special referee, this court has\r\n  the same scope of review as if the appeal is from the circuit court without a\r\n  jury.&nbsp; See Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229,\r\n  237, 391 S.E.2d 538, 543&nbsp;(1990) (â€œOur scope of review for a case heard by\r\n  a Master-in-Equity who enters a final judgment is the same as that for review\r\n  of a case heard by a circuit court without a jury.â€).Â  Under this scope, the\r\n  appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its views of\r\n  the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Grosshuesch v. Cramer, 367 S.C. 1,\r\n  4, 623 S.E2d 833, 834 (2005).Â  Thus, we may find facts and may reverse the masterâ€™s\r\n  factual findings if they are against the greater weight of the evidence.Â  Campbell v. Carr, 361 S.C. 258, 263, 603 S.E.2d 625, 627 (Ct. App. 2004).Â \r\n  Pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, when an appellate court chooses to find facts\r\n  in accordance with its own view of the evidence, the court must state\r\n  distinctly its findings of fact and the reason for its decision.Â  Dearybury\r\n    v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 382, 388, 544 S.E2d 620, 623 (2001).Â   \r\nThis broad scope of\r\n  review does not require the appellate court to disregard the findings of the\r\n  lower court.Â  Robinson v. Tyson, 319 S.C. 360, 362-63, 461 S.E.2d 397,\r\n  399 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  Nor are we required to ignore the fact the special\r\n  referee, who saw and heard the witnesses, is in a better position to evaluate\r\n  their credibility.Â  Ingram v. Kaseyâ€™s Assocs., 340 S.C. 98, 105, 531\r\n  S.E.2d 287, 291 (2000).Â  Furthermore, the appellant is not relieved of the\r\n  burden of convincing this court the special referee committed legal error in\r\n  its findings.Â  Pinckney v. Warren, 344 S.C. 382, 388, 544 S.E.2d 620,\r\n  623 (2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Motion for a Jury\r\n  TrialWhite argues the special\r\n  referee erred in denying his motion for a jury trial.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nAt the start of the\r\n  hearing White requested a jury trial.Â  However, White and Eadon agreed to allow\r\n  the special referee to hear testimony, and if the elements of Whiteâ€™s\r\n  counterclaims giving rise to a jury trial could not be established, they agreed\r\n  the special referee would issue his determination.Â  Conversely, if the evidence\r\n  presented established viable causes of action, the case would go to a jury.Â \r\n  After hearing testimony of both parties, the special referee found, based on\r\n  the facts presented, Whiteâ€™s counterclaims for conversion and slander of title were\r\n  not viable.  \r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversion\r\nConversion is a wrongful act emanating from either a\r\n  wrongful taking or wrongful detention.Â  Moore v. Weinberg, 373\r\n  S.C. 209, 227, 644 S.E.2d 740, 749&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2007); Kirby v. Horne\r\n    Motor Co., 295 S.C. 7, 366 S.E.2d 259 (Ct. App. 1988). Conversion is defined as â€œthe unauthorized\r\n  assumption and exercise of the rights of ownership over goods or personal\r\n  chattels belonging to another, to the alteration of their condition or to the\r\n  exclusion of the rights of the owner.â€Â  Mullis\r\n    v. Trident Emergency Physicians, 351 S.C. 503, 507, 570 S.E.2d 549, 550-51&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 2002); Green v. Waidner, 284 S.C. 35, 37, 324 S.E.2d 331, 333 (Ct. App.\r\n  1984); see Owens v. Andrews Bank &amp; Trust Co., 265 S.C. 490,\r\n  496, 220 S.E.2d 116, 119 (1975) (finding conversion may arise by the illegal\r\n  detention of anotherâ€™s property).Â   \r\nâ€œConversion\r\n  may arise by some illegal use or misuse, or by illegal detention of anotherâ€™s\r\n  personal property.â€ Moore, 373 S.C. 209, 227, 644 S.E.2d at 749; Regions\r\n    Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 667, 582 S.E.2d 432, 442 (Ct. App. 2003); Castell\r\n      v. Stephenson Fin. Co., 244 S.C. 45, 50-51, 135 S.E.2d 311, 313 (1964).Â  In\r\n  order to prevail in a conversion action, the plaintiff must prove either title\r\n  or right to possession of the property at the time of the conversion. Oxford\r\n    Fin. Co. v. Burgess,&nbsp; 303 S.C. 534, 539, 402 S.E.2d 480, 482&nbsp;(1991).\r\nIn\r\n  the case sub judice, White has had and continues to have actual\r\n  possession of the mobile home. Â Eadon did not exercise any unauthorized or\r\n  wrongful ownership over the mobile home as he never had actual possession of\r\n  the mobile home.Â  Instead, Eadon possesses the title of the mobile home that\r\n  the Bank assigned to him after the debt was paid.Â  Further, White understood he\r\n  would not have possession of the title until payments relating to his agreement\r\n  with Eadon were made in full.Â  Accordingly, White failed to establish the\r\n  necessary elements of conversion and does not have the right to hold the title\r\n  to the mobile home.Â   \r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;Slander of Title\r\nThe\r\n  term slander of title is defined as â€œa false and malicious statement, oral or\r\n  written, made in disparagement of a personâ€™s title to real or personal\r\n  property, causing him injury.â€Â  Pond Place Partners, Inc. v. Poole, 351 S.C. 1, 18-19, 567 S.E.2d 881, 890&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002); 50 Am.Jur.2d Â Libel\r\n    &amp; Slander Â§ 548 (1995). Generally, an action under slander of title may\r\n  only be maintained by one who possesses an estate or interest in the affected\r\n  property.Â  Id.; see generally Jeffrey F. Ghent, Slander\r\n    of Title: Sufficiency of Plaintiffâ€™s Interest in Real Property to Maintain\r\n    Action, 86 A.L.R.4th 738 (1991). The tort of slander\r\n  of title is almost identical to the tort of product disparagement, the only\r\n  difference being the former tort involves aspersing the quality of oneâ€™s title\r\n  to property and the latter tort involves aspersing the quality of oneâ€™s\r\n  property.Â  Poole, 351 S.C. at 18-19, 567 S.E.2d at 890.Â  Slander of\r\n  title is grounded in the tort of injurious falsehood, and the terms are often\r\n  used interchangeably.Â  Id.Â   \r\nAn\r\n  action for slander of title should not be confused with personal defamation.Â  Id.Â  The two differ in at least three ways.Â  Id.Â  First, in slander of title\r\n  causes of action, proof of a special harm is required in all cases; second, there\r\n  must be proof of a greater amount of fault than negligence regarding the\r\n  falsity of the statement; and, third, disparagement of property may, in a\r\n  proper case, be enjoined.Â  Id.Â  To establish slander of title, one must\r\n  show: â€œ(1) the publication of (2) a false statement (3) derogatory to\r\n  plaintiff's title (4) with malice (5) causing special damages (6) as a result\r\n  of diminished value in the eyes of third parties.â€Â  Huff v. Jennings, 319 S.C. 142, 146, 459 S.E.2d 886, 889&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995).\r\nHere, White failed\r\n  to establish the necessary elements of slander of title.Â  White admitted an\r\n  agreement existed with Eadon to enable White to purchase a mobile home.Â  Specifically,\r\n  White admitted Eadon would obtain financing for the purchase of the mobile home\r\n  and White would make the payments.Â  However, White failed to make the\r\n  payments.Â  As a result, Eadon paid off the loan and was assigned the title of\r\n  the mobile home.Â  Accordingly, Whiteâ€™s own admission negates any false\r\n  statement; thus, the cause of action for slander of title is without merit.Â \r\n \r\nII.Â  Statute of Frauds\r\nWhite contends the special referee erred in finding\r\n  the loan documents as a whole satisfied the statute of frauds.Â  We disagree.\r\nAny agreement not\r\n  to be performed within one year from the making must be in writing and signed\r\n  by the party against whom enforcement is sought.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 32-3-10(5)\r\n  (Supp. 2007).Â  It is well settled that the form of writing required by the\r\n  statute is not material.Â  Speed v. Speed, 213 S.C. 401, 404, 49 S.E.2d\r\n  588, 591&nbsp;(1948).Â  Indeed, the statute of frauds does not require that\r\n  memoranda of the contract be contained in one document, but permits the\r\n  essential contractual terms to be gathered from several writings which are\r\n  connected either expressly or through internal evidence of the subject matter\r\n  and occasion.Â  Young v. Indep. Pub. Co.,&nbsp; 273 S.C. 107, 110-111,\r\n  254 S.E.2d 681, 683&nbsp;(1979); Barr v. Lyle, 263 S.C. 426, 211 S.E.2d\r\n  232 (1975). As stated in Speed:\r\n\r\n\tIn such\r\n  case(s), the connection of the writings may be implied where their contents\r\n  show that they relate to the same parties and subject matter and are parts of\r\n  one and the same transaction.Â  The\r\n  writings, however, must contain internal evidence of their unity, relation or\r\n  connection.\r\n\r\n213\r\n  S.C. at 404, 49 S.E.2d at 391.\r\nHowever,\r\n  where several writings are relied upon to constitute the requisite memorandum,\r\n  they must, taken as a whole, set forth all the essential terms of the agreement\r\n  so the contract may be proved on the basis of such memorandum without resort to\r\n  parol evidence.Â  Young, 273 S.C. at 110-111, 254 S.E.2d at 683; Walker v. Preacher, 188 S.C. 431, 433, 199 S.E. 675, 677 (1938); Kennedy\r\n    v. Grambling, 33 S.C. 367, 369, 11 S.E. 1081, 1083 (1890).\r\nIn the case sub judice, the note, security agreement, and third party pledge agreement,\r\n  when taken as a whole, set forth the essential terms of the agreement between\r\n  Eadon and White.Â  Further, the third party pledge agreement signed by White\r\n  indicates the mobile home as collateral for Eadonâ€™s debt.Â   \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  we find White is judicially estopped from denying the existence of his\r\n  agreement with Eadon.Â  Judicial estoppel precludes a party from adopting a\r\n  position in conflict with one earlier taken in the same litigation. Commerce\r\n    Ctr. of Greenville, Inc. v. W. Powers McElveen &amp; Assoc., Inc., 347 S.C.\r\n  545, 554, 556 S.E.2d 718, 723&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001).Â  The doctrineâ€™s function is\r\n  to protect the integrity of the judicial process or the integrity of the courts\r\n  â€œrather than to protect litigants from allegedly improper or deceitful conduct\r\n  by their adversaries.â€Â  Id. Â The doctrine generally applies only to\r\n  inconsistent statements of fact.â€Â  Id.; Hayne Fed. Credit Union v.\r\n    Bailey, 327 S.C. 242, 251, 489 S.E.2d 472, 477 (1997) (adopting the\r\n  doctrine of judicial estoppel as it relates to matters of fact in South Carolina); Quinn v. The Sharon Corp., 343 S.C. 411, 416, 540 S.E.2d 474, 476\r\n  (Ct. App. 2000) (Anderson, J., concurring) (â€œA court must be able to rely on the\r\n  statements made by the parties because truth is the bedrock of justice.\r\n  Therefore, a litigant cannot â€˜blow both hot and cold.â€™ Under the doctrine of judicial estoppel, a\r\n  party that has assumed a particular position in a judicial proceeding, via its pleadings, statements, or\r\n  contentions made under oath, is prohibited from adopting an inconsistent\r\n  posture in subsequent proceedings.â€) (citations omitted).\r\nAt\r\n  the hearing before the special referee, White admitted an agreement existed\r\n  with Eadon to assist White in Â obtaining financing for Whiteâ€™s purchase of a\r\n  mobile home.Â  Furthermore, White admitted he was responsible for making the\r\n  loan payments.Â  As a result, White is precluded from adopting a position in\r\n  conflict with one earlier taken.\r\nIII.Â Â Doctrine of Merger of Title\r\nWhite\r\n  next argues the special referee erred in finding the doctrine of merger of\r\n  title inapplicable in the present case.Â  Specifically, White contends the\r\n  special referee erred in finding the note and security agreement were assigned\r\n  to Eadon.Â  We disagree.\r\nOrdinarily, when equitable and legal titles unite in the same person,\r\n  merger occurs and the equitable encumbrance ceases to exist.Â  First Fed.\r\n    Sav. and Loan Assâ€™n of South Carolina v. Finn,&nbsp; 300 S.C. 228, 231, 387\r\n  S.E.2d 253, 254&nbsp;(1989); Thompson v. Hudgens, 161 S.C. 450, 452, 159\r\n  S.E. 807, 810 (1931). The burden rests on the party opposing merger to prove a\r\n  contrary intention existing at the time the two interests came together. First\r\n    Fed., 300 S.C. at 231, 387 S.E.2d at 254.Â  An intention to prevent merger\r\n  may be implied from facts indicating merger would be opposed to the interest of\r\n  the person in whom the legal and equitable interests became united and that\r\n  such an intention existed at the time of the merger. Id. at 231, 387\r\n  S.E.2d at 254; McCreary v. Coggeshall, 74 S.C. 42, 53 S.E. 978 (1906). \r\n \r\nWhile White is\r\n  correct in his assertion Eadon extinguished the debt with the Bank, this does not\r\n  eliminate the existence of Whiteâ€™s agreement to make the payments of the loan.Â \r\n  Under the agreement between Eadon and White, White was the debtor.Â  Therefore,\r\n  it can be implied at the time the two interests came together Eadon opposed\r\n  merger.Â  Accordingly, the special referee did not err in finding the doctrine\r\n  of merger inapplicable.  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  merger is not favored either in the courts of law or of equity.Â  Lipscomb v.\r\n    Goode, 57 S.C. 182, 187, 35 S.E. 493, 495&nbsp;(1900). The South Carolina\r\n  Supreme Court stated in Lipscomb:\r\n\r\n\tNotwithstanding\r\n  the technical rule of law, equity will prevent or permit a merger as will best\r\n  subserve the purposes of justice, and the actual and just intention of the\r\n  parties; and, in the absence of an expression of intention, if the interest of\r\n  the person in whom the several estates have united, as shown from all the circumstances,\r\n  would be best subserved by keeping them separate, the intent will ordinarily be\r\n  implied. A merger will be prevented by equity only, however, for the purpose of\r\n  promoting substantial justice. It will not prevent a merger where such\r\n  prevention would result in carrying a fraud or other wrong into effect.\r\n\r\nId.Â  Here, to apply the doctrine of merger would promote\r\n  injustice.Â  It is clear from the record the intention and understanding was\r\n  White would acquire a mobile home through Eadonâ€™s loan and White agreed to make\r\n  the payments in full.Â  Additionally, Eadon remained secure in his loan because the\r\n  mobile home was pledged as collateral.Â   \r\nIV.Â Â Directed Verdict\r\n  and Counterclaims\r\nWhite also argues his case should be reversed on\r\n  appeal because the special referee failed to rule on his counterclaims or on\r\n  his motion for a directed verdict.Â  This issue is not preserved for review. \r\n\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, White acknowledges the special referee never made a final ruling on his\r\n  motion for a directed verdict or any relief requested in his counterclaims.Â  An\r\n  issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.Â  In re Michael H., 360 S.C. 540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729,\r\n  732 (2004).Â  In order for an issue to be preserved for appellate\r\n  review it must be raised and ruled upon by the trial court.Â  Staubes v. City\r\n    of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000); Jones v.\r\n      Daley, 363 S.C. 310, 315, 609 S.E.2d 597, 599 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  â€œError\r\n  preservation requirements are intended â€˜to enable the lower court to rule\r\n  properly after it has considered all relevant facts, law, and arguments.â€™ â€Â  Id. (quoting Iâ€™On v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716,\r\n  724 (2000)).Â  If the trial court does not rule on an issue, â€œthe reviewing\r\n  court simply would not be able to evaluate whether the trial court has\r\n  committed error.â€ Id. Furthermore, Whiteâ€™s counsel failed to make a\r\n  motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to alter or amend the special refereeâ€™s\r\n  order to obtain a final ruling on his motion for a directed verdict and counterclaims.Â \r\n  Accordingly, this issue is not preserved for our review.Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the decision of the special referee is  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON,\r\n  SHORT AND WILLIAMS, JJ., CONCUR.\r\n\r\n[1] A hypothecation or third party pledge agreement pledges the collateral of another\r\n  but does not require any payment by the particular person.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-044","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott,\r\n\t\t\t\tSenior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Cecil Kelly Jackson, Third Circuit Solicitorâ€™s Office, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  Joseph A. Dozier (Dozier)\r\n  appeals his conviction for armed robbery, arguing the trial court erred by (1)\r\n  refusing to charge the jury on strong armed robbery or common law robbery and\r\n  (2) deleting the element of â€œreasonably believedâ€ from the jury re-charge.Â  We\r\n  affirm.  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  February 28, 2005, Dozier entered a convenience store in Clarendon County under the guise of purchasing candy.Â  As the cashier counted his change, Dozier\r\n  displayed a handgun.Â  Dozier then reached into the cash register and took\r\n  approximately $120.Â  Surveillance cameras at the convenience store recorded the\r\n  incident.  \r\nShortly\r\n  after an investigating officer reviewed the surveillance tape, a vehicle\r\n  matching the one on the tape was found abandoned in a nearby secluded area.Â  The cashier identified the abandoned vehicle as the vehicle used during the\r\n  commission of the robbery.Â   \r\nLaw\r\n  enforcement then canvassed the nearby area for a suspect.Â  After review of the\r\n  surveillance tape, law enforcement identified Dozier as a man they questioned earlier\r\n  at a nearby hotel.Â  However, upon return to the hotel, Dozier was no longer at\r\n  the hotel.  \r\nLaw\r\n  enforcement learned Gloria Sweat (Sweat) leased the vehicle used in the\r\n  robbery.Â  Law enforcement contacted Sweat, and she identified Dozier in a\r\n  picture.Â  Sweat explained Dozier was at her house the night before the robbery.Â \r\n  Sweat added that when she awoke both her car keys and car were missing.Â  Law\r\n  enforcement subsequently arrested Dozier, and he then admitted to robbing the\r\n  convenience store.Â Â   \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  At trial, the cashier identified\r\n  Dozier as the person who robbed the convenience store and testified Dozier appeared to use a real gun during the\r\n  robbery.Â  At the close of evidence, the trial court\r\n  denied Dozierâ€™s request to charge the jury on the lesser included offense of\r\n  strong armed or common law robbery.Â  The trial court instructed the jury on\r\n  armed robbery and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent\r\n  crime.Â  After the jury began its deliberation, the foreman returned asking for\r\n  further instructions on armed robbery.Â  The trial court re-charged the jury on\r\n  the elements of armed robbery.Â  The jury found Dozier guilty of armed robbery\r\n  and possession of a weapon during a violent crime.Â  Dozier received a\r\n  mandatory life sentence.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review\r\n  errors of law only and is bound by the factual findings of the trial court\r\n  unless clearly erroneous.&nbsp; State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545\r\n  S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).&nbsp; â€œThe appellate court does not re-evaluate the\r\n  facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence, but simply determines\r\n  whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.â€ Â State v.\r\n    Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 583, 575 S.E.2d 852, 855 (Ct. App. 2003). Â If any\r\n  evidence exists in the record, this Court should affirm the trial court.&nbsp; Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.Â  \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Jury Charge\r\nDozier\r\n  argues the trial court erred by refusing to charge the jury on strong armed\r\n  robbery or common law robbery.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nGenerally, the\r\n  trial court is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina.Â  Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 665, 594 S.E.2d 462,\r\n  472-73&nbsp;(2004).Â  â€œThe law to be charged to the\r\n  jury is determined by the evidence presented at trial.â€Â  State v. Brown,\r\n  362 S.C. 258, 262-63, 607 S.E.2d 93, 95&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  If any evidence\r\n  supports a jury charge, the trial court should grant the request.Â  Id. at 263, 607 S.E.2d at 95.Â  To warrant reversal, a trial courtâ€™s refusal to give\r\n  a requested jury charge must be both erroneous and prejudicial to the\r\n  defendant.Â  Id.Â  â€œ[J]ury instructions should be considered as a whole,\r\n  and if as a whole they are free from error, any isolated portions which may be\r\n  misleading do not constitute reversible error.â€Â  State v. Aleksey, 343\r\n  S.C. 20, 27, 538 S.E.2d 248, 251&nbsp;(2000).Â   \r\nâ€œUpon\r\n  indictment for a greater offense, a trial court has subject matter jurisdiction\r\n  to convict a defendant for any lesser included offense.â€ State v. Tyndall,\r\n  336 S.C. 8, 21, 518 S.E.2d 278, 285 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  A lesser included offense\r\n  instruction is only required when the evidence warrants such an instruction.Â  Id.Â Â Â  It is not error to refuse to charge the lesser included offense unless evidence\r\n  exists which tends to show the defendant was guilty only of the lesser included\r\n  offense.Â  Id.Â  The trial court should refuse to charge a lesser included\r\n  offense where there is no evidence to show the defendant committed the lesser\r\n  rather than the greater offense.Â  State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 170, 478\r\n  S.E.2d 260, 268 (1996).Â  If based upon the evidence, a jury could rationally\r\n  find the defendant guilty of the lesser offense, due process requires a lesser\r\n  included offense be charged.Â  Tyndall, 336 S.C. at 21-22, 518 S.E.2d at\r\n  285.\r\n&nbsp;â€œStrong armed\r\n  robbery is defined as the felonious or unlawful taking of money, goods, or\r\n  other personal property of any value from the person of another or in his\r\n  presence by violence or by putting such person in fear.â€Â  State v. Rosemond,\r\n  356 S.C. 426, 430, 589 S.E.2d 757, 758 (2003).Â  Armed robbery, on the other\r\n  hand, is proved by establishing â€œthe\r\n  commission of a robbery and either one of the two additional elements: (1) that\r\n  the robber was armed with a deadly weapon or (2)\r\n  that the robber alleged that he or she was armed with a deadly weapon, either by action or words, while using a representation of a deadly\r\n  weapon or any object which a person present during the commission of the\r\n  robbery reasonably believed to be a deadly weapon.â€Â  State v. Jones, 342\r\n  S.C. 248, 252-53, 536 S.E.2d 396, 398 (Ct. App. 2000) (quotations omitted).\r\nIn\r\n  view of the evidence presented in this case, the trial court did not err in\r\n  denying Dozierâ€™s request to charge the lesser included offense of strong armed\r\n  or common law robbery.Â  The evidence shows Dozier entered into a convenience\r\n  store and removed money from the cash register while brandishing a gun.Â  Further,\r\n  the cashier testified he thought the gun was real.Â  Therefore no evidence tends\r\n  to show Dozier was guilty only of strong armed robbery.Â  The only reasonable\r\n  inference to be drawn from the totality of the evidence is Dozier committed the\r\n  offense while in possession of a deadly weapon, or at the very least, Dozier\r\n  alleged he was armed with a deadly weapon during the commission of the robbery,\r\n  and the cashier reasonably believed it to be a deadly weapon.Â   \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we find the trial court did not err by refusing to charge the jury on strong\r\n  armed or common law robbery.Â   \r\nII.Â Â Jury Re-charge\r\nDozier next argues the trial court erred by deleting\r\n  the element of â€œreasonably believedâ€ from the re-charge to the jury of the instruction\r\n  for armed robbery.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA jury charge is\r\n  correct if, when the charge is read as a whole, it contains the correct\r\n  definition and adequately covers the law.Â  In re McCracken, 346 S.C 87,\r\n  94, 551 S.E.2d 235, 239 (2001).Â  \r\nDozier\r\n  maintains the trial court erroneously deleted the words â€œreasonably believedâ€\r\n  from the re-charge of the law.Â  The record demonstrates the trial court used\r\n  the words â€œreasonably believedâ€ at least three times during the re-charge of\r\n  the law.Â  In addition, the trial court cited relevant portions of South Carolina case law to aid the jury in understanding the elements of armed robbery.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s re-charge of the law, when read as whole, contained the\r\n  correct instruction on the elements of armed robbery.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the decision of the trial\r\n  court is\r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nANDERSON, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-048","title":"State v.

Konduros, Family Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2008-UP-051\r\nHeard December 13, 2007 â€“ Filed January\r\n  14, 2008\r\nAFFIRMED \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tRichard L. Patton, of Greer, for\r\n  Appellants.\r\n\t\t\t\tKenneth C. Porter, of Greenville, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In\r\n  this divorce action between Thomas (Husband) and Gina (Wife) Brown, Husbandâ€™s\r\n  parents, Myron and Carol Brown (the Browns), appeal the family courtâ€™s order\r\n  assessing a portion of Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees against them.Â  Further, the\r\n  Browns contend the family court erred in finding they were not entitled to an\r\n  equitable interest in Husband and Wifeâ€™s house (the House).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were married in Ohio on November 27, 1982, and they moved to Greenville, South Carolina in 1985.Â  In\r\n  1989, Husband entered into a lease contract with an option to purchase the\r\n  House and 12.9 acres of property in Travelers Rest, South Carolina.Â  That\r\n  same year, the Browns moved from Florida to Greenville County.Â  Following their\r\n  purchase of the House, Husband and Wife continued to reside in a house they\r\n  were renting.Â  In 1992, the Browns moved into the House and from that\r\n  time, they lived there six months out of\r\n  the year without paying any rent.Â  Many people, including the Browns,\r\n  contributed to renovating the House.Â  In 1995, Husband and Wife built a new home on the property\r\n  where they resided through the remainder of the marriage.Â   \r\nHusband filed for divorce on November 14,\r\n  2000 on the grounds of adultery. Â On January 9, 2001, Wife filed an answer and\r\n  counterclaim, seeking affirmative relief.Â  This action was administratively\r\n  dismissed, and a new action was commenced to litigate the remaining issues\r\n  between the parties.Â  Wife filed an answer on June 18, 2002, which incorporated\r\n  her previous answer and counterclaim.Â  Thereafter, on June 22, 2002, she filed\r\n  an amended answer and third-party complaint, in which Wife alleged the Browns\r\n  were necessary parties to the divorce action because Husband and the Browns had\r\n  â€œcommon financial interests,â€ and Wife believed they might claim an interest in\r\n  the House and property surrounding the marital residence.Â  Pursuant to a\r\n  consent order filed on February 21, 2003, Wifeâ€™s action against the\r\n  Browns was consolidated with the divorce action.Â  \r\nOn May 12, 2003, Wife filed a motion to\r\n  compel discovery against the Browns, which the family court granted.Â  On\r\n  October 6, 2003, the family court issued a consent order requiring the Browns\r\n  to pay Wife $1,235 in attorneyâ€™s fees and costs based on the prior motion to\r\n  compel.Â   \r\nAt the final hearing on February 7 and 8,\r\n  2006, the family court found the Browns had no interest in the House.Â  Further,\r\n  the family court ordered the Browns to pay $5,006.60 of Wifeâ€™s expert witness\r\n  fee and $5,000 of Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The Browns filed a Rule\r\n  59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend the judgment, generally disputing the\r\n  assessment of attorneyâ€™s fees against them.[1]Â  The family court denied the motion.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn\r\n  appeal from a family court order, this Court has authority to correct errors of\r\n  law and find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 473, 415 S.E.2d 812, 814 (1992).Â  When\r\n  reviewing decisions of the family court, we are cognizant that the family court\r\n  had the opportunity to see the witnesses, to hear â€œthe testimony delivered from\r\n  the stand, and had the benefit of that personal observance of and contact with\r\n  the parties which is of peculiar value in arriving at a correct result in a\r\n  case of this character.â€Â  DuBose v.\r\n    DuBose, 259\r\n  S.C. 418, 423, 192 S.E.2d 329, 331 (1972) (internal citations omitted).Â  When\r\n  the evidence is conflicting and susceptible of different inferences, the family\r\n  court has the duty of determining not only the law of the case, but the facts\r\n  as well, because it had\r\n  the benefit of observing the witnesses and determining how much credence to\r\n  give each witnessâ€™s testimony.Â  Anders v.\r\n    Anders, 285\r\n  S.C. 512, 514, 331 S.E.2d 340, 341 (1985); see also Woodall v. Woodall, 322\r\n  S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996) (holding when\r\n  evidence is disputed, the appellate court may adhere to the family courtâ€™s\r\n  findings).Â   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nThe Browns argue\r\n  the family court abused its discretion in ordering them to pay part of Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees and costs.Â  Specifically, the Browns contend the family court erred\r\n  because (1) Wife failed to plead attorneyâ€™s fees against them; (2) they were a\r\n  third-party defendant; and (3) the fees were excessive.Â   \r\nThis\r\n  issue is not preserved for our review.Â  Our review of the record reveals that\r\n  the Browns did not raise these specific arguments to the family court.Â  At no\r\n  time did the Browns object to the introduction of Wifeâ€™s evidence relating to attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees and costs. Â The family court never ruled on these issues, and while the\r\n  Browns briefly argued the fees were â€œpunitive in natureâ€ in their Rule 59(e),\r\n  SCRCP, motion to alter or amend the judgment, the remaining issues presented on\r\n  appeal were not argued in the motion.Â  Further, counsel for the Browns conceded\r\n  at oral argument that the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees was not raised at trial.Â  See In re Michael H., 360 S.C.\r\n  540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729, 732 (2004) (â€œAn issue may not be\r\n  raised for the first time on appeal.Â  In order to preserve an issue for appeal,\r\n  it must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.â€).Â  Thus, the Brownsâ€™ failure to adequately raise these\r\n  issues precludes review on appeal.Â   \r\nII.Â  The House\r\nThe Browns contend the family court erred in finding\r\n  they did not have an equitable interest in the House.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  family court has exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine actions â€œfor settlement of\r\n  all legal and equitable rights of the parties in the actions in and to the real\r\n  and personal property of the marriage . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(A)(2)\r\n  (Supp. 2006).Â  Section 20-7-473 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006)\r\n  defines marital property as â€œall real and personal property which has been\r\n  acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of the date\r\n  of filing or commencement of marital litigation as provided in Â§ 20-7-472\r\n  regardless of how legal title is held . . . .â€Â  However, â€œ[t]he court does not\r\n  have jurisdiction or authority to apportion nonmarital property.â€Â  Â§ 20-7-473.\r\nSection\r\n  20-7-420(A)(19) grants the family court exclusive jurisdiction:\r\n\r\n\tto bring in and\r\n      make parties to any proceedings pending in the court any person or persons . .\r\n      . whose presence to the proceedings may be found necessary to a complete\r\n      determination of the issues therein, or the relief to which the parties\r\n      thereto, or any of them, may be entitled . . . .\r\n\r\nâ€œIn the past, subsection (19)\r\n  has been construed to grant authority over third parties when property claimed\r\n  to be marital was titled in a third partyâ€™s name.â€Â  Heape, 335 S.C. at\r\n  423, 517 S.E.2d at 2&nbsp;(citing Sexton v. Sexton,&nbsp;298 S.C.\r\n  359, 380 S.E.2d 832&nbsp;(1989) (holding the family court has jurisdiction to\r\n  join third parties when property is alleged to be marital but is owned by a\r\n  third party)).\r\nIn\r\n  the present case, the Wife sought an interest in the House, which was titled in\r\n  Husbandâ€™s name, alleging it to be marital property.Â  The Browns asserted they\r\n  were entitled to an equitable interest in the property because they made the\r\n  $7,000 down payment on the House. Â Accordingly, because the Browns had a\r\n  potential interest in the House, the family court properly made them parties to\r\n  the divorce action to determine if the House was marital property.\r\nThe\r\n  family court properly concluded the Browns had no legal interest in the House.Â  â€œBecause the family court is in a superior position to judge the\r\n  witnessesâ€™ demeanor and veracity, its findings should be given broad\r\n  discretion.â€Â  Scott v. Scott, 354\r\n  S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003).Â  In the present case, the family court found Husband and the Browns were not\r\n  credible.Â  The Browns asserted Tojali, Inc., a company they founded for\r\n  the benefit of Husband and his siblings, made the $7,000 down payment, thus\r\n  entitling them to an equitable interest in the House.Â  However, the sole evidence\r\n  corroborating the Brownsâ€™ testimony that Tojali, Inc., made the down payment\r\n  was the testimony of Husband. Â Further, while the Browns claim they are\r\n  entitled to an interest in the House, they never asserted ownership of the\r\n  House during their bankruptcy proceedings.  \r\nAdditionally, Husband and Wife purchased the surrounding property and the House during\r\n  their marriage. Â Both the contract to purchase the House and the title to the\r\n  House and surrounding property were in Husbandâ€™s name.Â  Even if the Browns made\r\n  the initial down payment, Wife testified that she and Husband used marital\r\n  funds to make the mortgage payments and pay down the debt on the House.Â  While\r\n  the Browns contributed with other family members to repairing and cleaning the House\r\n  over the years, Wifeâ€™s brother-in-law testified Husband paid for the\r\n  renovations to the House.Â Â  Accordingly, there is insufficient evidence to show\r\n  the Browns made material contributions to the House that would entitle them to\r\n  a special equity interest.Â  See Webber v. Webber, 285 S.C. 425, 427,\r\n  330 S.E.2d 79, 80 (Ct. App. 1985) (stating under the special equity doctrine,\r\n  â€œWhere [one] has made a material contribution to [anotherâ€™s] acquisition of\r\n  property during [marriage], [that person] acquires a special equity in the\r\n  property.â€) (internal citations omitted).  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  in Hayne Federal Credit Union v. Bailey, 327 S.C. 242, 489 S.E.2d 472\r\n  (1997), the Supreme Court was faced with the converse of this factual scenario.Â \r\n  There, the father initially failed to assert an interest in property deeded to\r\n  and titled in his sonâ€™s name and only later claimed an interest in the property\r\n  when creditors foreclosed on it. 327 S.C. at 252, 489 S.E.2d at 477.Â  The\r\n  Supreme Court judicially estopped the father from asserting ownership in the\r\n  house because in his prior divorce action, he claimed he had no legal interest\r\n  in the property.Â  Id.Â  The Supreme Court reinforced its position\r\n  stating, â€œWhen a party has formally asserted a certain version of the facts in\r\n  litigation, he cannot later change those facts when the initial version no\r\n  longer suits him.â€Â  Id.Â  In the present case, the Browns claim they are\r\n  entitled to share in this marital asset, yet they did not list the House as an\r\n  asset in their earlier bankruptcy proceedings.Â  Based on the evidence and\r\n  the Brownsâ€™ position in the previous litigation, we find it would be\r\n  inequitable to award the Browns an interest in the House.Â   \r\nTherefore,\r\n  we find the family court did not err in determining that the Browns did not have\r\n  an equitable interest in the House.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the family courtâ€™s order is  \r\nAFFIRMED.[2]\r\nANDERSON,\r\n  SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The Brownsâ€™ argument on attorneyâ€™s fees in their\r\n  59(e), SCRPP, motion was as follows:Â  â€œThe Courtâ€™s order requiring the Browns\r\n  to pay half of [Wifeâ€™s expertâ€™s] fees and $5000.00 of [Wifeâ€™s attorneysâ€™] fees\r\n  is punitive in nature based on the assumption that the Browns did not make\r\n  these records available when in fact they did.â€Â   \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-052","title":"State v.

MacNeille, of Hilton Head Island, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tTerry L. Finger, of Hilton Head Island, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Sylvester\r\n  White appeals the master-in-equityâ€™s order granting specific performance to Mehujael\r\n  Romero for the conveyance of a parcel of land located in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.[1]Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn\r\n  1995, White and his wife acquired a one acre parcel of land designated as 70 Gum Tree Road (Gum Tree Lot), Hilton Head Island, South Carolina from Whiteâ€™s father.[2]Â \r\n  White never lived on the property, but stated his intention was for his\r\n  children to inherit the property.Â  The surrounding land is still owned by\r\n  members of Whiteâ€™s family.Â   \r\nWhite\r\n  first met Armando Garcia Uriostegi (Garcia), sometime in 1996 or 1997, when\r\n  Garcia began renting a house next door to Whiteâ€™s.Â  According to White, shortly\r\n  after meeting Garcia, the two discussed placing a trailer on the Gum Tree Lot.Â \r\n  Eventually, Garcia moved a trailer onto a quarter portion of the Gum Tree Lot.[3]Â   \r\nShortly\r\n  after Garcia and his family moved onto the lot, White prepared a lease\r\n  agreement[4] in which Garcia agreed to pay rent of $200 a month\r\n  during a two year lease which commenced on September 3, 1999. According\r\n  to White, the two had an informal agreement to extend the lease until 2004\r\n  because Garcia was about to be incarcerated and wanted to make sure his family\r\n  had a place to live.Â  Consequently, White stated he accepted a total of $15,000\r\n  from Garcia for rent throughout the extended tenancy.Â  White also stated that\r\n  at Garciaâ€™s request he provided Garcia with a receipt for the total amount of\r\n  rent paid.Â  The writing White contends is the receipt states, â€œ[White] on\r\n  10/10/00 received 15,000 from Garcia for payment for lot on Gum Tree R[oa]d.â€[5]Â \r\n  However, Romero contends the same document is a receipt for the sale of the Gum\r\n  Tree Lot.[6]Â   \r\nRomero brought suit seeking to enforce the alleged contract to\r\n  convey real estate and specific performance for the conveyance of the Gum Tree\r\n  Lot.Â  The assistance of a translator was required at trial since Romero does\r\n  not speak English.Â  During the trial,\r\n  Romero testified that at the time of the alleged oral agreement for the\r\n  purchase of the Gum Tree Lot, she was present on the property but was not\r\n  walking the property with Garcia and White when they set the boundary lines.Â  Due to this separation, Romero could not\r\n  testify as to the size of the lot or the boundary lines.Â  Romero also testified\r\n  her husband paid White $15,000 for the property and she knew this because\r\n  â€œbefore [she and her husband paid] rent and then when they did the deal, that\r\n  is when her husband told her he bought the property.â€ Upon this answer, defense\r\n  counsel objected on the grounds of hearsay and the master struck Romeroâ€™s\r\n  response insofar as the information told to Romero by her husband.  \r\nAfter the bench trial concluded, the\r\n  master ordered White to convey Romero the entire Gum Tree Lot.Â  Specifically,\r\n  the master found the existence of an oral agreement for the sale of real estate\r\n  and the writing indicating Whiteâ€™s receipt of $15,000 was sufficient to satisfy\r\n  the Statute of Frauds, and, if not, there was sufficient part performance to\r\n  remove the claim from the Statute of Frauds. This appeal followed.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn an action in\r\n  equity tried by the judge alone, on appeal the appellate court has jurisdiction\r\n  to find facts in accordance with its views of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  Grosshuesch v. Cramer, 367 S.C. 1, 4, 623 S.E.2d 833, 834 (2005); Campbell v. Carr, 361 S.C. 258, 263, 603 S.E.2d 625, 627 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2004).Â  Thus, an appellate court in an appeal of an equity case tried\r\n  without a jury may find facts in accord with its view of the preponderance or\r\n  greater weight of the evidence and may reverse a factual finding by the trial\r\n  judge in such cases where the appellant satisfies this court that the finding\r\n  is against the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Campbell, 361 S.C. at\r\n  263, 603 S.E.2d at 627.Â  This broad scope of review does not require the\r\n  appellate court to disregard the findings of the trial court. Dearybury v.\r\n    Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 283, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002).Â  Nor is the\r\n  appellate court required to ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and\r\n  heard the witnesses, is in a better position to evaluate their credibility.Â  Ingram\r\n    v. Kaseyâ€™s Assocs., 340 S.C. 98, 105, 531 S.E.2d 287, 291 (2000).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Statute of Frauds\r\nWhite argues the Statute of Frauds bars the\r\n  enforcement of the alleged oral agreement. Specifically, White contends no\r\n  sufficient writing exists memorializing the alleged oral agreement.Â  We agree.Â  \r\n \r\nThe\r\n  Statute of Frauds requires that a contract for the sale of land must be in\r\n  writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. Â S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§32-3-10(4) (2006).Â  Failure to put such a contract in writing renders it\r\n  void.Â  Player v. Chandler, 299 S.C. 101, 105, 382 S.E.2d 891, 894\r\n  (1989).Â  A writing sufficient to remove an oral agreement from the Statute of\r\n  Frauds â€œmust reasonably identify the subject matter of the contract,\r\n  sufficiently indicate a contract has been made between the parties, and state\r\n  with reasonable certainty the essential terms of the agreement.â€ Id. (citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Â§ 131 (1981)).Â  Every essential\r\n  element must be expressed in the writing for the contract to meet the Statute\r\n  of Frauds. Cash v. Maddox, 265 S.C. 480, 484, 220 S.E.2d 121, 122\r\n  (1975).Â   \r\nThe\r\n  Statute of Frauds does not require any particular form of writing however, the\r\n  writings must establish the essential terms of the contract without resort to\r\n  parol evidence.Â  Id.Â  The identification of the land to be sold is one\r\n  of the essential terms of a contract for sale of real property.Â  Id.Â  Although parol evidence may be used to explain terms appearing in a description\r\n  of land, â€œthe description itself must clearly identify the particular parcel of\r\n  land.â€ Id.Â  If a description of the land does not include the location\r\n  or boundaries, it is inadequate. Fici v. Koon, 372 S.C. 341, 346-47, 642\r\n  S.E.2d 602, 604-605 (2007). â€œWhere there is no adequate description of which\r\n  part of a parcel is to be conveyed, the conveyance is unenforceable.â€ Id. at 347, 642 S.E.2d at 605. \r\n \r\nIn Fici Buyer brought an action for specific performance of a contract for the sale of\r\n  thirty acres of land.Â  The contract lists the property to be sold as â€œâ€˜lot 2,\r\n  Polock Road, tax map #052000102â€™ in Irmo, Richland County,â€ but this\r\n  description refers to the entire fifty acre parcel owned by Sellers. Id.Â  at 343, 642 S.E.2d at 603.Â  The contract specifies that the property conveyed\r\n  will have â€œat least thirty acresâ€ and â€œpurchaser and seller will agree on\r\n  location of property linesâ€ but Buyer and Sellers never agreed on the\r\n  dimensions or location of the thirty acres among the entire fifty acre parcel.[7] Id.Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court found the description did not\r\n  show with reasonable certainty which thirty acres of the entire fifty acre\r\n  parcel was to be conveyed.Â  Instead the supreme court found the contract was\r\n  â€œnothing more than an agreement to agree which is unenforceable under the\r\n  Statute of Frauds.â€ Id. at 347, 642 S.E.2d at 605.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  regard to the necessary burden of proving an oral contract the supreme court\r\n  has said, â€œ[w]e are not concerned primarily with the quantity of the evidence\r\n  offered to establish the oral contract,â€¦[r]ather we are concerned more with the\r\n  quality of the evidence.â€ Parr v. Parr, 268 S.C. 58, 65, 231 S.E.2d 695,\r\n  698 (1977).Â  Clear, specific, definite evidence must convincingly prove the\r\n  existence of the contract. Id.Â  Romero must â€œestablish the contract by\r\n  â€˜competent and satisfactory proof, such as is clear, definite, and certain.â€™â€ Cash\r\n    v. Maddox, 265 S.C. 480, 484, 220 S.E.2d 121, 122 (1975) (citing Aust v.\r\n      Beard, 230 S.C. 515, 521, 96 S.E.2d 558, 561 (1957)).\r\nIn the case sub judice, the writing Romero relies upon to enforce the alleged oral\r\n  agreement to convey real property is insufficient.Â  Although it is signed by\r\n  White, the writing is unclear as to whether White intended to sell or rent the\r\n  Gum Tree Lot to Garcia.Â  The master found Whiteâ€™s testimony on the matter\r\n  lacked credibility because White pled guilty to possession of cocaine, a crime\r\n  of moral turpitude.Â  Even if Whiteâ€™s testimony was discounted, we are still\r\n  left with a nebulous writing which fails to specify whether it is referring to the entire Gum Tree Lot or only the\r\n  one quarter portion Garcia rented in the past.Â  The writing also fails to\r\n  identify the boundaries or state the size of the Gum Tree Lot.Â  Accordingly, we find there is no sufficient writing\r\n  that satisfies the requirements of the Statute of Frauds.Â   \r\nII.&nbsp;Existence of an Oral\r\n  Agreement and \r\nPart Performance Exception to the Statute of Frauds\r\nWhite\r\n  argues the master erred in concluding the part performance exception to the\r\n  Statute of Frauds was satisfied.Â  White maintains the only evidence of an oral\r\n  agreement is Romeroâ€™s inadmissible hearsay statement.Â Â  We agree.  \r\nIn\r\n  order for part performance of an oral agreement to remove the agreement from\r\n  the Statute of Frauds and permit specific performance, Romero must establish\r\n  acts that relate clearly to the agreement, exclusive of any other relation\r\n  between the parties touching the agreement. Player v. Chandler, 299 S.C.\r\n  101, 105-106, 382 S.E.2d 891, 894 (1989).Â  â€œPart performance may be proved by\r\n  evidence of the following: (1) improvements to the real estate; (2) possession\r\n  of the real estate; (3) payment of the purchase price.â€ Bradshaw v. Ewing, 297 S.C. 242, 245, 376 S.E.2d 264, 266 (1989).Â  For improvements to constitute\r\n  part performance, they must be made by the purchaser with his own means upon\r\n  the faith of the sellerâ€™s promise. Id. at 246, 376 S.E.2d at 266.Â  Such\r\n  improvements must also be permanent and â€œof such a character as to enhance\r\n  substantially the value of the property.â€ Id. at 246, 376 S.E.2d at 267.\r\n  Payment of the purchase price is the weakest evidence of part performance and\r\n  is not sufficient on its own to remove a contract from the Statute of Frauds. Id.Â  \r\n \r\nRomero\r\n  was not able to establish acts clearly relating to the alleged agreement for\r\n  sale of the property that did not involve the partiesâ€™ prior rental agreement.Â \r\n  Much of Romeroâ€™s testimony regarding the terms of the oral contract was found\r\n  to be hearsay because she was not present when the terms of any oral contract\r\n  were being discussed.Â  Hearsay is a statement, other than one made by the\r\n  declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to\r\n  prove the truth of the matter asserted.Â  Rule 801(c), SCRE.Â  Hearsay is\r\n  generally inadmissible. Rule 802, SCRE.Â   \r\nRomero\r\n  testified she was present on the property, but â€œshe was not walking with themâ€\r\n  as the alleged contract was discussed between White and Garcia. In addition,\r\n  Romero does not speak or understand English whereas White and Garcia discussed\r\n  the alleged oral contract in English. Romero also testified Garcia purchased\r\n  the property from White because â€œbefore they [paid] rent and then when they did\r\n  the deal that is when her husband told her he bought the property.â€ White\r\n  objected to this statement and the master struck the hearsay testimony â€œinsofar\r\n  as what her husband said.â€Â   \r\nBesides\r\n  Romeroâ€™s stricken testimony, the record is devoid of any other evidence\r\n  establishing a clear, unequivocal agreement for the sale of the Gum Tree Lot.Â \r\n  Romero also failed to provide evidence of part performance.Â  The only evidence\r\n  of a permanent improvement to the Gum Tree Lot is the installation of a septic\r\n  tank, initiated by White.Â  Neither Romero nor Garcia made any improvement to\r\n  any portion of the Gum Tree Lot.Â  As to possession of the real property, Romero\r\n  testified she and her family only rented a quarter of the lot prior to the\r\n  alleged oral agreement for the sale of the land. Neither Romero nor Garcia paid\r\n  property taxes for the Gum Tree Lot. Romero also testified the receipt was for\r\n  the purchase of the Gum Tree Lot, but White testified it was for rental\r\n  payments on a quarter portion of the lot. Even if we assume the $15,000 was for\r\n  the purchase of the Gum Tree Lot, payment alone is not sufficient to remove the\r\n  oral contract form the Statute of Frauds. Bradshaw, 297 S.C. at 245, 376\r\n  S.E.2d at 266. Instead, there would need to be some other evidence exclusive of\r\n  any prior lessor/lessee relationship between the parties. Player, 299\r\n  S.C. at 105-106, 382 S.E.2d at 894.Â Â Â Â Â   \r\nWe\r\n  find Romero failed to establish any clear, definite, and convincing evidence\r\n  regarding the existence of an oral agreement between the parties.Â  In the\r\n  absence of an oral agreement and without evidence upon which part performance\r\n  could be found to support[8] a grant of specific performance, we must find the part performance exception to\r\n  the Statute of Frauds does not apply.\r\nBecause\r\n  we find no oral agreement, we need not address Whiteâ€™s remaining argument.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518\r\n  S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not review remaining\r\n  issues when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we find there is not an oral agreement\r\n  to purchase the Gum Tree Lot.Â  Accordingly the decision of the master is\r\nREVERSED. \r\nHEARN, C.J.,\r\n  KITTREDGE and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The answer filed in this action purports to be filed\r\n  on behalf of Sylvester White and his wife, Christina.Â  However, Christina White\r\n  was adjudged to be in default.Â  The two separated sometime in 1999.Â   \r\n[2] Whiteâ€™s deposition was taken de bene esse for use at trial pursuant to Rule 30, SCRCP.Â  At the time of the deposition,\r\n  White was incarcerated for cocaine related charges to which he had pled\r\n  guilty.Â  The master found Whiteâ€™s testimony lacked credibility because White\r\n  pled guilty to possession of cocaine, a crime of moral turpitude.Â   \r\n[3] White stated he planned on dividing the one acre lot\r\n  into four parcels as rentals.Â   \r\n[4] The lease refers to Lot One, not a quarter portion of\r\n  the Gum Tree Lot.Â  Garcia and Mehujael Romero, his wife, lived on the Gum Tree\r\n  Lot until Garcia was incarcerated, and then Romero remained on the property\r\n  with their children.  \r\n[5] According to White, this receipt was for late and\r\n  future rent for the quarter of the Gum Tree Lot on which the trailer was\r\n  located.  \r\n[6] Garcia signed over all of his interests in his\r\n  property to Romero.Â   \r\n[7] A surveyor drew up two versions of a plat denoting\r\n  the proposed property lines of the thirty acres.Â  Buyer signed the second plat\r\n  but Sellers never agreed to the property lines on either plat.\r\n[8] For a court of equity to compel specific performance\r\n  of an oral agreement where part performance is alleged to have removed the\r\n  contract from the Statute of Frauds, the court â€œmust find: (1) clear evidence\r\n  of an oral agreement; (2) the agreement had been partially executed; and (3)\r\n  the party who requested performance had completed or was willing to complete\r\n  his part of the oral agreement.â€ Settlemeyer v.

Palm Beach,\r\n  for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: At issue in this appeal is the application\r\n  of an experience modifier rating to Appellant BP Staff in the workersâ€™\r\n  compensation insurance policy issued by Capital City Insurance Company.Â  The Administrative Law Court upheld the decision by the Department of Insurance to support the\r\n  application of S.B. Phillipsâ€™ experience modifier rating to BP Staff.Â  BP Staff\r\n  appeals the Administrative Law Courtâ€™s ruling on the ground that S.B. Phillips\r\n  and BP Staff are separate entities owned respectively by father and son.Â  We\r\n  affirm the ruling of the Administrative Law Court.\r\nFACTS\r\nS.B.\r\n  Phillips is a temporary staffing agency founded in Greenville in 1968 and owned\r\n  by Sam Phillips. Blanton Phillips, Sam Phillipsâ€™ son, worked for S.B. Phillips\r\n  for several years in numerous positions until he eventually was â€œrunning most\r\n  of the back office operations of the business, accounting and payroll and risk\r\n  management.â€ Blanton primarily handled workers compensation for S.B. Phillips.\r\n  In July of 2002, Blanton formed BP Staff, Inc. which provided â€œpayroll,\r\n  staffing, risk management, and other related servicesâ€ to companies. Blanton is\r\n  the sole owner of BP Staff. \r\nIn\r\n  September 2002, BP Staff and S.B. Phillips entered into an agreement whereby BP\r\n  Staff would hire the temporary workers of S.B. Phillips, perform payroll\r\n  functions for those workers, and provide workersâ€™ compensation for those\r\n  workers. In essence, BP Staff would hire S.B. Phillips temporary employees and\r\n  perform the same â€œback officeâ€ services for those temporary employees as\r\n  Blanton himself had performed while working with S.B. Phillips. The temporary\r\n  workers would still be provided to S.B. Phillips for placement in temporary\r\n  positions with S.B. Phillipsâ€™ clients as the workers had been in the past.\r\n  After the agreement S.B. Phillips essentially eliminated the in-house\r\n  performance of â€œback officeâ€ functions such as risk management while still\r\n  performing the â€œfront officeâ€ services of sales, recruiting, and customer\r\n  service. Some of BP Staffâ€™s permanent employees were previously employed by S.B.\r\n  Phillips. As late as 2004, permanent employees of BP Staff remained on S.B.\r\n  Phillipsâ€™ payroll but were â€œassigned to BP Staff.â€ \r\nIn\r\n  September 2002, S.B. Phillips and BP Staff each applied for workersâ€™\r\n  compensation insurance through South Carolinaâ€™s Assigned Risk Pool after they\r\n  were unable to secure coverage in the voluntary insurance market. South Carolinaâ€™s Department of Insurance (Department) forwarded the applications to Capital\r\n  City Insurance Company (Capital City), one of two carriers in the Assigned Risk\r\n  Pool. After reviewing BP Staffâ€™s application, Capital City issued a policy for\r\n  BP Staff with a 1.33 experience modifier rating (Modifier).Â  Experience\r\n  modifier ratings (Modifier) are factors calculated using a complex formula\r\n  developed by the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI).[1]Â \r\n  NCCI also produces an experience rating plan manual (Plan Manual) that sets\r\n  forth the rules governing the application of Modifiers to different entities\r\n  applying for workersâ€™ compensation insurance. Once approved by the Department\r\n  of Insurance, the Plan Manual sets forth the rules regarding insurance coverage\r\n  in the Assigned Risk Pool. \r\nModifiers\r\n  are factors which affect the total cost of an entityâ€™s premium. Under the Plan\r\n  Manual, new companies applying for workerâ€™s compensation insurance receive a\r\n  neutral Modifier of one. If an insured has a history of above-normal claims for\r\n  their type of industry, the insuredâ€™s Modifier would increase and thus cause an\r\n  increase in the overall premium. The Modifier system provides an incentive for\r\n  employers to provide a safe workplace. Insurance carriers traditionally\r\n  consider temporary staffing agencies to be a high-risk business. \r\nIn\r\n  its determination to apply the 1.33 Modifier of S.B. Phillips to BP Staff, Capital City reviewed the Plan Manual and information provided by S.B. Phillips and BP\r\n  Staff before concluding the Modifier should follow the employees that created\r\n  the experience. BP Staffâ€™s request for reconsideration of the Modifier was\r\n  granted by Capital City but the decision to apply S.B. Phillipsâ€™ modifier to BP\r\n  Staff was not altered.Â  BP Staff appealed Capital Cityâ€™s imposition of a 1.33 Modifier\r\n  to NCCI and then the South Carolina Department of Insurance.Â  The Department\r\n  held an evidentiary hearing on October 14, 2004, after which it ruled in favor\r\n  of Capital City. \r\nBP\r\n  Staff subsequently appealed the Departmentâ€™s findings to the Administrative Law\r\n  Court (ALC) on August 5, 2005. On August 23, 2006, the ALC upheld the\r\n  Departmentâ€™s findings, specifically the interpretation of the Plan Manual, the\r\n  evidence in support of applying the 1.33 Modifier to BP Staff, the sufficiency\r\n  of the Departmentâ€™s findings, and the denial of BP Staffâ€™s request to reopen\r\n  the record and admit a letter issued by NCCI subsequent to the Departmentâ€™s\r\n  hearing. BP Staff filed notice to appeal with this court on September 22, 2006. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAs\r\n  revised by Act 387 in 2006, South Carolina Code Section 1-23-380 sets forth the\r\n  standard of review when the court of appeals is sitting in review of a decision\r\n  by the Administrative Law Court on an appeal from an administrative agency.Â \r\n  Section 1-23-380(A)(5) forbids the court of appeals from substituting â€œits\r\n  judgment for the judgment of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on\r\n  questions of fact.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (2006).Â  The court of\r\n  appeals may reverse or modify the decision only if substantial rights of the\r\n  appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative decision is clearly\r\n  erroneous in light of the reliable and substantial evidence on the whole\r\n  record, arbitrary or otherwise characterized by an abuse of discretion, or\r\n  affected by other error of law.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5)(d)-(f) (2006).Â \r\n  â€œThe review of the administrative law judgeâ€™s order must be confined to the\r\n  record.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(C) (2006). \r\nThe\r\n  Departmentâ€™s decision can be set aside if it is unsupported by substantial\r\n  evidence.Â  Hamm v. Central States Health &amp; Life Co., 292 S.C.\r\n  408, 410, 357 S.E.2d 5, 6&nbsp;(1987); Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C.\r\n  130, 136, 276 S.E.2d 304, 307 (1981).Â  â€œSubstantial evidenceâ€\r\n  is not a mere scintilla of evidence, nor the evidence viewed blindly from one\r\n  side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole,\r\n  would allow reasonable minds to\r\n  reach the conclusion the administrative agency reached.Â  Taylor v.\r\n    S.C. Depâ€™t of Motor Vehicles, 368 S.C. 33, 36, 627 S.E.2d 751,\r\n  752&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006) cert. granted, Aug. 9, 2007; S.C. Coastal\r\n    Conservation League v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 363 S.C.\r\n  67, 76, 610 S.E.2d 482, 487&nbsp;(2005).\r\nThe\r\n  party challenging a governmental bodyâ€™s decision bears the burden of proving\r\n  the decision is arbitrary.Â  Pressley v. Lancaster County, 343 S.C. 696,\r\n  704, 542 S.E.2d 366, 370&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001).Â  Appellants also shoulder the\r\n  burden of proving an agencyâ€™s decision is unsupported by evidence.Â  Bursey\r\n    v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 360 S.C. 135, 142, 600 S.E.2d\r\n  80, 84&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004), affâ€™d, 369 S.C. 176, 631 S.E.2d 899 (2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Experience\r\n  Rating Plan Manual\r\nBP Staff argues the Administrative Law Court improperly considered the Plan Manual.Â \r\n  This argument is not preserved for our review.\r\nBP Staff did not contest either the Departmentâ€™s or the ALCâ€™s\r\n  treatment of the Plan Manual as â€œthe applicable governing document concerning\r\n  the issues in this case.â€ In fact, BP Staff concedes in numerous briefs that â€œthe terms of the 1984 Plan Manual contain all rules\r\n  applicable to this dispute.â€ In their brief to the ALC, BP Staff uses the term\r\n  â€œregulationâ€[2] when referring to the Plan Manual and presses the court to utilize the rules of\r\n  statutory construction in interpreting the Plan Manual. \r\nAn issue not ruled upon by antecedent trial courts is not\r\n  preserved for appeal. West v. Newberry\r\n    Electric Coop., 357 S.C. 537, 543,\r\n  593 S.E.2d 500, 503 (Ct. App. 2004) (holding an issue neither addressed by the\r\n  trial judge in the final order nor mentioned in a subsequent motion for\r\n  reconsideration is not preserved for review); Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330\r\n  S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is\r\n  axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must\r\n  have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for\r\n  appellate review.â€).Â  In addition, a party cannot argue one ground at trial and\r\n  an alternate ground on appeal. State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587\r\n  S.E.2d 691, 693-94 (2003).\r\nII. Â Â Â Â  Part\r\n  III(B) of the Experience Rating Plan Manual\r\nBP Staff argues the Administrative Law Court erred in holding the\r\n  list in Part III(B) of the Plan Manual is not a restrictive enumeration of the actions\r\n  that cause the experience modification rating of one entity to be applied to another\r\n  entity.Â  We disagree.\r\nPart III(B) of the Plan Manual involves ownership changes which\r\n  may affect the Modifier bestowed upon an entity.Â  Part III(B) explains â€œwhen a\r\n  change occurs, a determination shall be made to exclude or retain an entityâ€™s\r\n  experience.â€ Part III(B) further states:\r\n\r\n\tFor purposes of this Plan, a change in ownership includes any of the following:\r\n\t(a) Sale, transfer or conveyance of all or a portion of an\r\n  entityâ€™s ownership interest.\r\n\t(b) Sale, transfer or conveyance of an entityâ€™s physical assets to another entity which takes over its operations.\r\n\t(c) Merger or consolidation of two or more entities.\r\n\t(d) Formation of a new entity subsequent to the dissolution or non-operative capacity of an entity.\r\n\t(e) Voluntary or court-mandated establishment of a trustee or receiver, excluding a debtor in possession, a trustee under a revocable trust or a franchisor. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nIn determining the nature of the list in Part III(B) the ALC first\r\n  employed rules of statutory construction and dictionary definitions of\r\n  â€œinclude.â€Â  â€œWhere a word is not defined in a statute, our appellate courts\r\n  have looked to the usual dictionary meaning to supply its meaning.â€ Lee v.\r\n    Thermal Engineering Corp., 352 S.C. 81, 91-92, 572 S.E.2d 298, 303 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2002); State v. Dickinson, 339 S.C. 194, 199, 528 S.E.2d 675, 677\r\n  (Ct. App. 2000) (citing Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary for the definition of\r\n  â€œobtainingâ€ used in a statute for obtaining property in fraudulent manner).Â \r\n  The ALC quoted the third edition of the American Heritage Dictionary of the\r\n  English Language and Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary, the latter of which defines\r\n  â€œincludeâ€ as â€œto contain as part of something.â€ Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004 and 6th ed. 1990). \r\nOn appeal, BP Staff makes a conclusory argument that â€œnone of the[se] definitions of the word\r\n  â€œincludesâ€ provide[s] any guidance as to whether the list contained in Part\r\n  III(B) of the Plan Manual is exclusive in nature.â€ Failure to provide arguments\r\n  or supporting authority for an issue renders it abandoned. First Savings Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  ALC also used case law to determine the nature of the list in Part III(B),\r\n  specifically, how other courts have interpreted the term â€œinclude.â€Â  BP Staff\r\n  argues the ALC incorrectly cited three cases that allegedly utilize the term\r\n  â€œincludeâ€ in a manner to indicate a partial list. In its order the ALC referred\r\n  to Adkins v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 360 S.C. 413, 602 S.E.2d 51 (2004), Douglass ex rel. Louthian v. Boyce, 344 S.C. 5, 542 S.E.2d 715 (2001), and Reliance Ins.\r\n    Co. v. Smith, 327 S.C. 528, 489 S.E.2d 674 (Ct. App. 1997), as appellate\r\n  decisions that have employed an expansive interpretation of â€œinclude.â€ Louthian, Adkins, and Reliance respectively involve the South Carolina\r\n  Probate Code, the state prison system, and state agency rulemaking.Â  While none\r\n  of these cases define â€œinclude,â€ they all illustrate courtsâ€™ usage of â€œincludeâ€\r\n  in an expansive manner.Â  For example, in Louthian the South\r\n  Carolina Supreme Court found that â€œother fiduciary\r\n  propertyâ€ as used in Section 62-1-109 of the South Carolina Probate Code\r\n  includes the proceeds of a wrongful death action since such an action is\r\n  brought by a fiduciary.Â  Such proceeds were not expressly enumerated in any\r\n  definition of â€œother fiduciary property.â€ 344 S.C. at 10, 542 S.E.2d at\r\n  717-18.Â  The supreme court has also held simply because a matter is not\r\n  expressly mentioned in a list does not mean that matter is forbidden or\r\n  restricted from an agencyâ€™s reach.Â  S.C. Coastal Conservation League v. S.C.\r\n    Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 354 S.C. 585, 588-89, 582 S.E.2d 410,\r\n  412 (2003).Â  \r\nAppellant fails to prove the ALCâ€™s holding regarding the\r\n  Department of Insuranceâ€™s interpretation of Part III(B) of the Plan Manual is\r\n  arbitrary, characterized by an abuse of discretion, or otherwise affected an\r\n  error of law.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§\r\n  1-23-380(A)(5)(d)-(f) (2006);Â  Â First Savings Bank, 314\r\n  S.C. at 363, 444 S.E.2d at 514 (â€œMere allegations of error are\r\n  not sufficient to demonstrate an abuse of discretion.â€)Â  Accordingly we find no\r\n  reason exists to reverse or modify the ALCâ€™s holding.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Substantial\r\n  Evidence\r\nBP\r\n  Staff argues the record is devoid of substantial evidence to support the Administrative Law Courtâ€™s ruling regarding the application of a 1.33 experience modifier rating to BP Staff.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe record is replete with evidence indicating BP Staff and S.B.\r\n  Phillips have a unique relationship which justifies the application of S.B.\r\n  Phillipsâ€™ Modifier to BP Staffâ€™s policy of workersâ€™ compensation insurance.Â  \r\nNeither\r\n  Sam nor Blanton Phillips has any ownership in the otherâ€™s company, but S.B.\r\n  Phillips and BP Staff have a unique relationship.Â  S.B. Phillips was BP Staffâ€™s\r\n  first client. Pursuant to a 2002 contract, BP Staff hired the temporary\r\n  employees of S.B. Phillips and provides those temporary employees back to S.B.\r\n  Phillips for S.B. Phillips to place in employment. Under the contract BP Staff\r\n  provides the payroll and workersâ€™ compensation for those employees as well as\r\n  risk management for that group of S.B. Phillipsâ€™ employees. Approximately 80\r\n  employees remained at S.B. Phillips following the institution of the contract.\r\n  These employees handle the â€œfront officeâ€ services of sales, recruitment, and\r\n  placement of temporary employees. \r\nAlthough\r\n  BP Staff has over two thousand employees, only four of those employees are\r\n  permanent or non-temporary employees. The four permanent employees work in Greenville in the same office building where S.B. Phillips is located. In the first ten\r\n  months following BP Staffâ€™s inception, S.B. Phillips provided approximately\r\n  ninety-seven percent of BP Staffâ€™s payroll. BP Staff and S.B. Phillips also\r\n  applied for workersâ€™ compensation coverage in an assigned risk plan at\r\n  approximately the same time. \r\nDwayne Schumpert, an underwriter at Capital City Insurance,\r\n  reviewed BP Staffâ€™s and S.B. Phillipsâ€™ applications for insurance coverage as\r\n  part of South Carolinaâ€™s Assigned Risk Pool.[3]Â \r\n  To Schumpert it â€œappeared that there had been a new company set up so that they\r\n  would have the temporary portion and then S.B. had the permanent employees.â€\r\n  From the information both companies supplied, it was clear the payroll of S.B.\r\n  Phillips had been moved to BP Staff resulting in an initial payroll of 20\r\n  million dollars as soon as BP Staff was formed.\r\nSchumpert also believed BP Staff and S.B. Phillips were related\r\n  due to the similarities in both companiesâ€™ applications. Although the\r\n  applications were in separate envelopes, the envelopes were addressed in the\r\n  same manner and were received on the same day. The applications requested the\r\n  same effective date, expiration date, and limits as well as two types of\r\n  coverage that are rarely requested. Both applications listed the same three\r\n  insurance companies as proof of rejection from the voluntary market.[4] Identical portions of the\r\n  applications were blank and both applications listed Kara deBorde as the person\r\n  responsible for handling claims information. The identical nature of the\r\n  applications caused Schumpert to believe the same individuals had filled out\r\n  each companyâ€™s application for coverage. \r\nEach application also had notations regarding the coverage they\r\n  were requesting. The S.B. Phillipsâ€™ application explained â€œwe are not seeking\r\n  coverage for temporary employeesâ€ but that coverage was requested only for\r\n  permanent, administrative staff. Likewise the BP Staff application noted,\r\n  â€˜[t]his application is for coverage for temporary employees only.â€ The drug\r\n  policy information BP Staff provided to Capital City was faxed with a cover\r\n  letter indicating it was a policy for BP Staff but many of the individual,\r\n  substantive pages explaining the drug policy referred to S.B. Phillips or\r\n  Phillips Staffing. \r\nDue to these similarities Schumpert applied the 1.33 Modifier of S.B.\r\n  Phillips to the workersâ€™ compensation insurance policy of BP Staff.Â  When\r\n  Schumpertâ€™s decision was further reviewed by Paula Shields at NCCI and Dean\r\n  Kruger at the South Carolina Department of Insurance, both came to the same\r\n  conclusion that S.B. Phillipsâ€™ Modifier should follow the employees to BP Staff\r\n  which was operating as in-concert with S.B. Phillips as a successor-type\r\n  company. BP Staff had â€œthe same operations, the same clients, the same\r\n  employeesâ€ as S.B. Phillips. At the Department of Insurance hearing, Blanton\r\n  admitted BP Staff and S.B. Phillips operate in-concert and share employees. \r\nIn addition, when dealing with the South Carolina Employment Security\r\n  Commission BP Staff had claimed it was a successor to S.B. Phillips and as a\r\n  successor, â€œshould have received a successor number and predecessor rate.â€ BP\r\n  Staffâ€™s report to the South Carolina Employment Security Commission further\r\n  states that â€œexempt wages [are] covered under predecessorâ€™s employers.â€ \r\nThe\r\n  Department of Insuranceâ€™s decision can be set aside if it is unsupported by\r\n  substantial evidence. Hamm v. Central States Health &amp; Life Co.,\r\n  292 S.C. 408, 410, 357 S.E.2d 5, 6&nbsp;(1987).Â  The possibility of drawing two\r\n  inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agencyâ€™s\r\n  finding from being supported by substantial evidence.Â  Bursey v. S.C. Depâ€™t\r\n    of Health &amp; Envtl. Control,&nbsp;369 S.C. 176, 188, 631 S.E.2d 899,\r\n  906&nbsp;(2006). The credibility and weight of a witnessâ€™s testimony is for the\r\n  trier of fact.Â  Parsons v. Georgetown Steel, 318 S.C. 63, 67, 456 S.E.2d\r\n  366, 368&nbsp;(1995).Â  In light of the evidence presented in the record, we\r\n  find substantial evidence supports the ALCâ€™s finding that the Department of\r\n  Insuranceâ€™s determination that S.B. Phillipsâ€™ Modifier should apply to BP\r\n  Staff.\r\nIV.Â Â Â  Supplementation of\r\n  the Record\r\nBP\r\n  Staff argues the Administrative Law Court improperly ruled the Department of Insurance did not commit an error of law\r\n  when the Department refused to allow cumulative supplemental evidence into the\r\n  record following the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nAfter the Departmentâ€™s evidentiary hearing concluded, BP Staff\r\n  sought to admit a November 3, 2004 letter issued by Wendy Steinberg, an employee\r\n  in NCCIâ€™s Experience Rating Department, that states â€œS.B. Phillips and BP Staff\r\n  Inc. are not combinable with each other.â€ BP Staff was unsuccessful in arguing\r\n  the Department should admit the letter into the record. The ALC upheld the\r\n  Departmentâ€™s decision and found such a decision â€œto reopen an administrative\r\n  record for additional evidence is within the Departmentâ€™s sound discretion and\r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.â€ Brenco v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 363 S.C. 136, 145, 609 S.E.2d 531, 536 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005). \r\nBP Staff argued in their pre-hearing brief to the ALC that S.B.\r\n  Phillips and BP Staff were not combinable. During the Departmentâ€™s hearing,\r\n  evidence was presented that NCCI initially held BP Staff and S.B. Phillips were\r\n  not combinable. In the post-hearing brief to the Department, BP acknowledges\r\n  that â€œduring the October 14 hearing, two NCCI officials testified that BP Staff\r\n  and S.B. Phillips were not combinable.â€ \r\nThrough\r\n  BP Staffâ€™s own admissions, the letter stating BP Staff and S.B. Phillips are\r\n  not combinable is cumulative to the evidence already in the record. â€œAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its\r\n  probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,\r\n  confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue\r\n  delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.â€ Rule 403, SCRE.Â  In\r\n  addition, BP Staff has made no showing that the additional evidence of the\r\n  November 3 letter would result in a changed outcome. â€œTo warrant reversal based\r\n  on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the appellant must prove both the\r\n  error of the ruling and the resulting prejudice.â€ Wright v. Craft, 372\r\n  S.C. 1, 34, 640 S.E.2d 486, 504 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Accordingly we find no error\r\n  of law or abuse of discretion by the ALC in upholding the Department of\r\n  Insuranceâ€™s decision not to reopen the record. \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., THOMAS, J., and GOOLSBY,\r\n    A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] NCCI is a rating organization that collects data from\r\n  carriers and provides statistical and rating information on workerâ€™s\r\n  compensation and employee injuries to several states, including South Carolina.\r\n \r\n[2] Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary defines â€œregulationâ€ to be â€œ1)\r\n  The act or process of controlling by rule or restriction; 2) Bylaw; 3) A rule\r\n  or order, having legal force, usually issued by an administrative agency.â€ (8th ed. 2004).\r\n[3] When companies cannot obtain insurance coverage in\r\n  the voluntary market, they may apply for coverage under South Carolinaâ€™s\r\n  Assigned Risk Pool.

Â One day in June of\r\n  2004, Gambrell told Garner he believed Lois was â€œrunning aroundâ€ on him.Â  The\r\n  following night, Gambrell allegedly told Garner he had severely beat Lois.Â  After\r\n  each incident, the parties reconciled.Â  \r\nOn July\r\n  12 and 13 of 2004, Lois visited her mother, who was recuperating from surgery,\r\n  but Lois did not show up to visit her mother, as expected, on July 14, 2004.Â  The\r\n  Gambrellâ€™s neighbors and Garner testified they last saw Lois at the marital\r\n  home approximately July 15, 2004.Â  On July 16, 2004, Garner visited the house\r\n  to collect rent at approximately 9:30 or 10:00 p.m.Â  Gambrell did not answer\r\n  the door but eventually came around the side of the house.Â  Garner testified\r\n  Gambrell appeared nervous and sweaty.Â  That same evening, Gambrell built a\r\n  large bonfire.Â  One neighborhood teenager estimated Gambrell started the fire\r\n  at approximately 8:00 or 9:00 p.m.Â  Another neighborhood teenager noticed the\r\n  fire after he got off work at either 9:00 or 10:00 p.m. that evening.Â  Garner\r\n  did not notice the fire when he visited Gambrell.Â  He testified, however, he\r\n  saw Gambrell at approximately 4:00 a.m. the following morning, tending the\r\n  large bonfire.Â  \r\nGambrell moved out of the house the following day.Â  Garner\r\n  testified Gambrell told him that Lois had come to the house, taken all of her\r\n  things, and left.Â  Gambrell told Garner he thought Lois was staying in a hotel\r\n  in Anderson.Â  Garner testified the inside of the house was trashed with debris\r\n  and evidence of a fight.Â  There was also a spot on the carpet that looked like\r\n  blood.Â  Garner and his family cleaned the house and shampooed the carpet.Â  There\r\n  were numerous personal items left in the house including â€œwomanâ€™s baloney . . .\r\n  [such as] clothes, womenâ€™s deodorant, razors, [and] womenâ€™s products.Â  Stuff\r\n  like that.â€Â  Garner and his family members also cleaned the bonfire debris,\r\n  taking most of it to a landfill.Â  When Garner ran out of garbage bags, he\r\n  shoveled the remaining debris into garbage barrels in the back yard.Â  Garner\r\n  found numerous articles in the debris including Loisâ€™s birth certificate and\r\n  Social Security card.Â  \r\nLoisâ€™s mother and sister reported Lois missing on or about August\r\n  23, 2004.Â  City of Anderson Detective James Stewart investigated the missing\r\n  personâ€™s report.Â  Stewart testified Gambrell reported he had not seen Lois in\r\n  three months.Â  Officer Jamie Brothers also testified Gambrell told him he had\r\n  not seen Lois in three months.Â  Brothers further testified Gambrell said he\r\n  thought Lois was in Texas with a family member.Â  \r\nThe police investigated and recovered bone fragments in the garbage\r\n  barrels.Â  Around the burn area, the police also found Loisâ€™s jewelry and glasses\r\n  and other metal items such as car keys, zippers, and buttons.Â  Inside the house,\r\n  the police found the blood stain but were unable to identify the blood as human\r\n  blood.Â  \r\nThe bone fragments were identified by a forensic anthropologist as\r\n  belonging to a woman approximately forty years old and five foot four inches in\r\n  height.Â  Loisâ€™s mother testified Lois was approximately 43 years old at the\r\n  time she disappeared.Â  The bone fragments were also identified, through DNA\r\n  comparison of Loisâ€™s mother, as belonging to an offspring of Loisâ€™s mother.Â  \r\nGary\r\n  Bean, an arson investigation expert, visited the site and testified he noticed\r\n  the smell of a burned body.Â  Bean opined the bonfire burned between 10 and 12\r\n  feet in diameter at a temperature, between 1000 and 1300 degrees Fahrenheit,\r\n  sufficient to burn a human body.Â  A forensic chemist testified a heavy\r\n  petroleum accelerant such as kerosene or diesel fuel started the fire.Â  Neighbors\r\n  testified Gambrell fed the fire with books and clothes.Â  In the debris after the\r\n  fire, there was evidence that tires, a mattress, and living room furniture were\r\n  also burned.Â  Â Â \r\nChristopher\r\n  Wickware, a car salesman, testified he sold Lois a Chevrolet Cavalier and later\r\n  hired a company to repossess the vehicle.Â  The payments were subsequently made\r\n  and the car returned to Wickwareâ€™s dealership lot between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00\r\n  a.m. one night in August of 2004.Â  The car was trashed, as if it had been\r\n  outside for a period of time with the windows down.Â  \r\nThe jury convicted\r\n  Gambrell of murder and the trial court sentenced Gambrell to life\r\n  imprisonment.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Directed Verdict\r\nGambrell argues\r\n  the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nWhen ruling on a\r\n  motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence\r\n  or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight. State v.\r\n    Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 555, 564 S.E.2d 87, 92 (2002).Â  This court must review\r\n  the denial of a directed verdict by reviewing the evidence and all reasonable\r\n  inferences in the light most favorable to the State. Â State v. Burdette,\r\n  335 S.C. 34, 46, 515 S.E.2d 525, 531 (1999). Â This court must affirm the denial\r\n  of an accusedâ€™s motion for a direct verdict if there is any direct evidence or\r\n  any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt\r\n  of the accused. Â State v. Harris, 351 S.C. 643, 653, 572 S.E.2d 267, 273\r\n  (2002).Â  The standard of review is the same where the State relies exclusively\r\n  on circumstantial evidence.Â  State v. Cherry, 361 S.C. 588, 593-94, 606\r\n  S.E.2d 475, 477-78&nbsp;(2004).\r\nIn this case, the\r\n  State presented substantial circumstantial evidence of Gambrellâ€™s guilt.Â  Murder\r\n  is defined as the â€œkilling of any person with malice aforethought, either\r\n  express or implied.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-10 (2003).Â  There are numerous\r\n  facts supporting the trial courtâ€™s denial of the motion for a directed verdict.\r\nGambrell and Lois\r\n  had a stormy relationship and Gambrell physically harmed Lois on prior\r\n  occasions.Â  Garner and other witnesses observed Lois at the marital home within\r\n  a day or two of the bonfire.Â  Gambrell made conflicting statements as to the\r\n  last time he had seen Lois.Â  Witnesses observed Gambrell at or near the bonfire\r\n  at various times as it burned.Â  Bones found in the bonfire debris were\r\n  identified as belonging to an offspring of Loisâ€™s mother.Â  See State\r\n    v. Al-Amin, 353 S.C. 405, 411-13, 578 S.E.2d 32, 34-36 (Ct. App. 2003)\r\n  (Concealment or attempted destruction of the body of a murdered person is a\r\n  probative fact tending to show guilt.). Â Other items belonging to Lois were\r\n  found near the burn site.Â  Loisâ€™s vehicle was mysteriously returned to the car\r\n  dealership near the time the investigation into Loisâ€™s disappearance began.Â  Taken\r\n  together, these facts constitute substantial circumstantial evidence presented\r\n  by the State to warrant submission of the case to the jury.Â  The motion for a\r\n  directed verdict was properly denied.\r\nII. Motion for Mistrial\r\nGambrell next\r\n  argues the trial court erred in refusing his motion for a mistrial based on\r\n  Officer Stewartâ€™s statement on cross-examination.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nDuring\r\n  cross-examination, defense\r\n  counsel questioned Stewart about Gambrellâ€™s alleged statement that he had not\r\n  seen Lois in three months.Â  Defense counsel asked:Â  â€œCould it have been that he\r\n  said [he] hadnâ€™t seen her in three or four weeks . . . ?â€Â  Stewart replied:Â \r\n  â€œNo, sir.Â  I am certain on that.Â  I was walking back to the control booth at\r\n  the Anderson County Detention Center.â€Â  The State briefly redirected and\r\n  defense counsel moved for a mistrial.Â  Defense counsel declined the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s offer of a curative instruction.Â  \r\nWe find\r\n  Gambrell waived this issue by declining the curative instruction.Â  See State v. Watts, 321 S.C. 158, 164-65, 467 S.E.2d 272, 276 (Ct. App.\r\n  1996) (finding defendant waived issue by rejecting offer by trial court to give\r\n  a curative instruction).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  Gambrellâ€™s conviction is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-064","title":"Butts v.

Courtney Gruber and R. Walter Hundley, both of Charleston, for\r\n          Appellant.\r\n        Clarke W. McCants, III, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  William Butts appeals a circuit court order affirming the South Carolina\r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation Commissionâ€™s determination that Butts was not totally and\r\n  permanently disabled after suffering a work-related injury.Â  The essence of\r\n  Buttsâ€™ appeal is that the combined\r\n  effects of his pre-existing psychological condition and his subsequent injury\r\n  resulted in a greater disability than he would have experienced from the injury\r\n  alone, resulting in his inability to work and complete disability under S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-400 (1985 &amp; Supp. 2006).Â  In light of the recent decision\r\n  from our supreme court in Ellison v. Frigidaire Home Products, 371 S.C.\r\n  159, 638 S.E.2d 664 (2006), we agree with Butts that the Commission imposed an\r\n  inappropriate legal standard in evaluating the effects and relationship of his\r\n  pre-existing injury to his subsequent work-related injury.Â  Accordingly, we reverse\r\n  and remand to the circuit court, which shall remand the matter to the\r\n  Commission with instructions to consider Buttsâ€™ claim under the Ellison standard.Â  \r\nI.\r\nWilliam\r\n  Butts sustained an admitted workersâ€™ compensation injury to his lower back on\r\n  November 7, 2000 while working for C.R. England Trucking as a truck driver.Â \r\n  According to Butts, he heard a snap in his back when he picked up a pallet\r\n  while working on a long-distance trucking assignment.Â  England Trucking paid\r\n  some of Buttsâ€™ medical bills and also paid him temporary compensation for the\r\n  back injury.Â  Butts thereafter contended his back injury aggravated his\r\n  pre-existing psychological condition of post-traumatic stress disorder.[1]Â \r\n  Butts alleged he was permanently and totally disabled as a result of the\r\n  combined effects of his accident and psychological condition and sought\r\n  lifetime medical benefits.Â Â Â  \r\nIn an order filed\r\n  March 4, 2003, the single commissioner found Butts had lost more than fifty\r\n  percent of the use of his back as a result of the accident, in combination with\r\n  his pre-existing arthritis, and that the accident had aggravated his\r\n  pre-existing post-traumatic stress disorder.Â  The single commissioner found\r\n  Butts was permanently and totally disabled and ruled he was entitled to\r\n  lifetime medical benefits.Â  \r\nEngland Trucking\r\n  sought review of the single commissionerâ€™s order by the Commission.Â  In a\r\n  decision filed January 13, 2004, the Commission found Butts had suffered an\r\n  injury to his lower back, but reversed the single commissionerâ€™s determination\r\n  that the injury resulted in the aggravation of a pre-existing psychological\r\n  condition.Â  The Commission found Butts was entitled to compensation for a ten\r\n  percent, permanent, partial disability to his lower back as a result of the\r\n  accident.Â  Â Â \r\nButts appealed to the circuit court, which remanded\r\n  the matter to the Commission â€œto state with specificity the evidence upon which\r\n  its decision is based.â€Â  The circuit court stated there was evidence in the\r\n  record which â€œclearlyâ€ supported the original finding of the single\r\n  commissioner that Butts suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, which\r\n  â€œboth pre-existed and was aggravated by the work-related accident.â€Â  The circuit\r\n  court observed that neither England Trucking nor the Commission had cited to\r\n  any specific medical evidence to support the findings of the Commission\r\n  regarding Buttsâ€™ claim.Â  Â Â \r\nUpon\r\n  remand, the Commission issued an order filed March 15, 2005 that more fully set\r\n  forth the reasons for its decision.Â  The Commission found Butts sustained an\r\n  injury to his back as a result of a work-related accident, but that Butts â€œdid\r\n  not sustain any other permanent injury to any other part of his body as a\r\n  result of the accident . . . and did not sustain any psychological injury, or\r\n  aggravation to a pre-existing psychological condition as a result of said\r\n  accident.â€Â  The Commission further found that Butts â€œsuffered from significant\r\n  psychological and physical problems which existed before the accident in this\r\n  caseâ€ and â€œthat any inability of [Butts] to engage in any employment activities\r\n  is not due to any injury sustained by him while working for [England\r\n  Trucking].â€Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Commission awarded Butts benefits for a ten percent, permanent, partial\r\n  disability to his lower back pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-30 (1985 &amp;\r\n  Supp. 2006), the scheduled injury statute, and authorized payment for all\r\n  causally related and authorized medical treatment for the injury to his lower\r\n  back.Â  Butts sought a review of this decision.Â  The circuit court, with a\r\n  different judge presiding, upheld the decision of the Commission by order filed\r\n  July 20, 2006.Â  Butts appeals.\r\nII.\r\nIn this case we are presented with conflicting views\r\n  on the appropriate scope of review.Â  Butts contends the Commission applied the\r\n  wrong legal standard in denying his claim that he was totally disabled.Â  He\r\n  further contends the circuit court improperly found substantial evidence\r\n  supported the Commissionâ€™s determination because application of the wrong legal\r\n  standard affected the Commissionâ€™s determination.Â  In contrast, England\r\n  Trucking argues the Commissionâ€™s fact-based determination should not be\r\n  reversed because it is supported by substantial evidence.Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes\r\n  the standard for judicial review of decisions of the Commission.Â  West v. Alliance Capital, 368 S.C. 246, 628 S.E.2d 279&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).Â  Under the APA, an appellate court may reverse or modify the\r\n  decision of the agency if the agencyâ€™s findings, inferences, conclusions, or\r\n  decisions are affected by an error of law or are clearly erroneous in view of\r\n  the substantial evidence in the whole record.Â  Id.; see also S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380 (Supp. 2006).Â  Substantial evidence is evidence that,\r\n  considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the\r\n  conclusion reached by the Commission.Â  Rodney v. Michelin Tire Corp.,\r\n  320 S.C. 515, 466 S.E.2d 357 (1996).Â  The possibility of drawing two inconsistent\r\n  conclusions from the evidence does not mean the agencyâ€™s conclusion is\r\n  unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  Ellis v. Spartan Mills, 276 S.C.\r\n  216, 277 S.E.2d 590 (1981). \r\nâ€œConversely,\r\n  where the Commissionâ€™s decision is controlled by an error of law, this courtâ€™s\r\n  review is plenary.â€Â  Lizee v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Mental Health, 367\r\n  S.C. 122, 126, 623 S.E.2d 860, 862&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  An appellate court\r\n  may reverse the Commission when its decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Callahan\r\n    v. Beaufort County Sch. Dist.,&nbsp;375 S.C. 92, 651 S.E.2d\r\n  311&nbsp;(2007).\r\nIII.\r\nOn appeal, Butts contends the circuit court erred in\r\n  ruling there was substantial evidence to support the Commissionâ€™s findings (1)\r\n  that Butts did not sustain a psychological injury or the aggravation of a\r\n  pre-existing psychological problem as a result of his work-related accident,\r\n  and (2) that Buttsâ€™ inability to sustain gainful employment was not due to any\r\n  work-related injury.Â  He further asserts the combined effects of his\r\n  pre-existing psychological condition and his subsequent injury resulted in a\r\n  greater disability than he would have experienced from the injury alone,\r\n  resulting in his inability to work and complete disability under the legal\r\n  standard recently set forth in Ellison v. Frigidaire Home Products, 371\r\n  S.C. 159, 638 S.E.2d 664 (2006).Â  He asserts the application of an\r\n  inappropriate legal standard affected the Commissionâ€™s determination and thus\r\n  constituted an error of law. \r\nIn reversing the single commissionerâ€™s award, the Commission\r\n  stated records from the Department of Veteran Affairs noted Butts had â€œreported\r\n  symptoms of PTSD, including depression, loss of sleep, loss of interest in\r\n  pleasurable things, loss of energy, loss of concentration, increased appetite\r\n  and suicidal ideation, and that he â€˜has been getting progressively worse for\r\n  roughly four years.â€™â€Â  The Commission observed this note was prepared two weeks\r\n  after Buttsâ€™ injury and makes no reference to any physical injury he sustained\r\n  while working for his employer.Â  \r\nThe Commission also\r\n  noted Dr. E. Selman Watson, who evaluated Butts at the request of England\r\n  Trucking, had found Buttsâ€™ emotional condition followed a slow and insidious\r\n  course that had been building before the accident.Â  The Commission stated, â€œDr.\r\n  Watson is further of the opinion that while the accident may have contributed\r\n  to the Claimantâ€™s decline, other medical ailments suffered by the Claimant, and\r\n  which pre-date the accident involved here, may have also served to threaten his\r\n  livelihood.â€Â  Â Â \r\nThe circuit court\r\n  summarily noted â€œthere is strong evidence to support the Commissionâ€™s finding[]\r\n  that [Buttsâ€™] pre[-]existing psychological condition was not aggravated by the\r\n  injury to his lower back.â€Â  The circuit court stated there was evidence cited\r\n  by the Commission that Butts suffered from psychological and physical problems\r\n  prior to his accident and that he had applied for work since the date of his\r\n  accident.Â  Â Â Â \r\nOn appeal Butts cites Ellison, in which our\r\n  supreme court held â€œ[t]here is no requirement that the pre-existing condition\r\n  aggravated the injury, or that the injury aggravated the pre-existing\r\n  condition, so long as there is a greater disability simply from the â€˜combined\r\n  effectsâ€™ of the injury and the pre-existing condition.â€Â  371 S.C at 164, 638\r\n  S.E.2d at 666.Â  In that case, Ellison fractured his leg, causing a twenty\r\n  percent disability.Â  Id. at 161, 638 S.E.2d at 665.Â  The court held\r\n  Ellisonâ€™s pre-existing physical conditions, including hypertension, sleep\r\n  apnea, prostate cancer, diabetes, and congestive cardiac disease, were properly\r\n  considered to determine that Ellison was entitled to permanent and total\r\n  disability benefits because he was physically unable to work after his\r\n  accident.Â  Id.Â  \r\nOur\r\n  supreme court further noted in Ellison that the proper section to apply\r\n  was not the scheduled injury statute found at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-30 (1985\r\n  &amp; Supp. 2006), but rather, the general disability statute, id. Â§\r\n  42-9-400(a) (1985), which provides in pertinent part as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n  If an employee who has a permanent physical impairment\r\n    from any cause or origin incurs a subsequent disability from injury by accident\r\n    arising out of and in the course of his employment, resulting in compensation\r\n    and medical payments liability or either, for disability that is\r\n      substantially greater, by reason of the combined effects of the preexisting\r\n      impairment and subsequent injury or by reason of the aggravation of the\r\n      preexisting impairment, than that which would have resulted from the subsequent\r\n      injury alone, the employer or his insurance carrier shall in the first\r\n    instance pay all awards of compensation and medical benefits provided by this\r\n    Title; but such employer or his insurance carrier shall be reimbursed from the\r\n    Second Injury Fund . . . .Â  (Emphasis added.)[2]\r\n\r\nRelying\r\n  upon Ellison, Butts contends the Commissionâ€™s â€œfinding that [he] did not\r\n  suffer any psychological injury or aggravation of a pre[-]existing\r\n  psychological problem as a result of [his work-related] accident . . . was not\r\n  supported by the substantial evidence in the record.â€Â  He further contends\r\n  that, â€œto the extent . . . the . . . findings are predicated upon a requirement\r\n  that the pre[-]existing condition have been aggravated by the work-related\r\n  accident, those findings are erroneous as a matter of law, in that they are not\r\n  consistent with the [South Carolina] Supreme Court holding in Ellison v. Frigidaire\r\n    Home Products.â€Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nButts\r\n  further asserts that â€œ[t]he substantial evidence in\r\n  the record supports a finding that [he] sustained a physical injury as a result\r\n  of a work-related accident which, when combined with the pre[-]existing mental\r\n  illness, rendered him incapable of continuing to work as a long distance truck\r\n  driver, and therefore, rendered him permanently incapable of performing gainful\r\n  employment.â€&nbsp; England Trucking presents a different take on the\r\n  evidence and argues application of the Ellison standard does not affect\r\n  the result reached by the Commission because â€œ[t]he substantial evidence here\r\n  shows that the injury to Mr. Buttsâ€™ lower back did not combine with, or\r\n  aggravate, his PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder] to cause any disability.Â \r\n  The Commission found that the evidence shows Mr. Buttsâ€™ inability to work, if\r\n  any, is caused solely by that non-work related condition.â€Â  Â Â \r\nWe do agree with Butts that the Commission erred in not following\r\n  the Ellison standard.Â  We, however, decline to reach the ultimate merits\r\n  of Buttsâ€™ position under the Ellison standard.Â  We believe in the first instance that the Commission should be given\r\n  the opportunity to assess and weigh the evidence under the proper legal\r\n  standard.Â  Â Â Â \r\nAs\r\n  noted above, the court in Ellison held it is not necessary that the new\r\n  injury aggravate the pre-existing condition; rather, it is enough if the combined\r\n    effects of the new injury and the pre-existing condition result in a\r\n  greater disability to the claimant.Â  In the current appeal, neither the\r\n  Commission nor the circuit court had the benefit of Ellison at the time\r\n  their decisions were rendered and they did not apply this legal standard.[3]Â \r\n  Rather, they seemed to focus on the fact that Butts suffered from a\r\n  pre-existing impairment that allegedly was not exacerbated by the subsequent\r\n  accident, which is not the standard in Ellison. \r\nAs a\r\n  result, we reverse and remand this case to the circuit court, which shall send\r\n  the case back to the Commission with instructions that the Commission consider,\r\n  on the existing record, Buttsâ€™ claim under the Ellison standard.Â  \r\nIV.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order on appeal is \r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and KITTREDGE and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n  \r\n\r\n[1] Butts reportedly acquired this condition as a result\r\n  of his service in Vietnam.Â  He first received treatment for this stress\r\n  condition in September 2000.Â  \r\n[2]Â  Section 42-9-400(a) was recently amended, but the change\r\n  does not affect this appeal as it applies only to injuries occurring on or\r\n  after July 1, 2007.Â  The amendment eliminated the language regarding the\r\n  combined effects.Â  The statute now provides in relevant part:Â  â€œIf an employee\r\n  who has a permanent physical impairment from any cause or origin incurs a\r\n  subsequent disability from injury by accident arising out of and in the course\r\n  of his employment, resulting in compensation and medical payments liability or\r\n  either, for disability that is substantially greater and is caused by\r\n    aggravation of the preexisting impairment than that which would have\r\n  resulted from the subsequent injury alone, the employer or his insurance\r\n  carrier shall pay all awards of compensation and medical benefits provided by\r\n  this title . . . .â€ Â 2007 Act No. 111, Pt. II, Â§ 3 (emphasis added). Â We do not\r\n  reach the question whether Ellison has been effectively overruled by\r\n  2007 Act No. 111.Â  However, since the change applies only to injuries occurring\r\n  on or after July 1, 2007, the current appeal must be decided under the version\r\n  of section 42-9-400 that was applicable at the time of Buttsâ€™ injury, which is\r\n  the same version of the statute that was applied in Ellison.\r\n[3]Â  Ellison was issued on November 20, 2006; the\r\n  Commissionâ€™s order was filed on March 15, 2005 and the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  order was filed on July 20, 2006.Â  Ellison does not represent new law,\r\n  but is simply a matter of statutory interpretation.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-065","title":"In the Matter and Care of Wooten","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayUnPubOpinion.cfm?caseNo=2008-UP-065","description":null,"date":"2008-01-22","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n.style1 {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS OPINION HAS NO\r\n  PRECEDENTIAL VALUE.Â  IT SHOULD NOT BE CITED OR RELIED ON AS PRECEDENT IN ANY\r\n  PROCEEDING EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY RULE 239(d)(2), SCACR.\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter\r\n          of the Care and Treatment of Wayne Wooten, Respondent,\r\n        v.\r\n        The State of South Carolina, Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Richland County\r\nÂ J.

McIntosh, Assistant Attorney General Deborah R.J. Shupe, Assistant\r\n          Attorney General R. Westmoreland Clarkson, all of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Appellate Defender LaNelle C. DuRant, of the South Carolina\r\n          Commission on Indigent Defense, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The State filed a petition in the circuit court against\r\n  Wayne Wooten under the South Carolina Sexually Violent Predator (SVP) Act, S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§Â§ 44-48-10 to -170 (2002 &amp; Supp. 2006), alleging Wooten met the\r\n  statutory requirements for civil commitment as a SVP.Â  The circuit court denied\r\n  the petition, and the State appeals, arguing the circuit court erred (1) in\r\n  refusing to consider evidence of a prior offense that did not result in a\r\n  conviction, and (2) in finding there was no probable cause to believe Wooten satisfies\r\n  the definition of a SVP.Â  We reverse and remand.[1] \r\n1. On December 28,\r\n  2005, the State filed a petition to declare Wooten a SVP and to seek his civil\r\n  commitment.Â  At the probable cause hearing, the State presented evidence that\r\n  Wooten was indicted in 2000 for assault with intent to commit criminal sexual\r\n  conduct in the first degree with a ten-year old girl for an incident that\r\n  occurred in 1999.Â  In addition, the State presented evidence that Wooten pled\r\n  guilty in 2003[2] to a charge of committing a lewd act on a child from an incident arising in\r\n  2001 and was sentenced to six years in prison.Â  The victim in that case was a\r\n  nine-year-old girl.Â  \r\n2.Â The circuit court\r\n  found there was no probable cause to classify Wooten as a SVP. Â In its\r\n  order, the circuit court found â€œthat in connection with the unconvicted charge\r\n  of Assault with Intent to Commit Criminal Sexual Conduct with a Minor in the\r\n  First Degree that the law presumes an individual is innocent until proven\r\n  guilty.â€Â  The court â€œconclude[d] as a matter of law [that it could not]\r\n  consider such unconvicted conduct.â€Â  The court further found â€œthat the\r\n  remaining conviction of Lewd Act upon a Child is not sufficient to establish\r\n  probable cause.â€Â  The State appeals. \r\n3. The circuit court erred as a\r\n  matter of law in holding that the court, in evaluating a petition for probable\r\n  cause under the SVP Act, could not consider evidence of Wootenâ€™s alleged and\r\n  unadjudicated offense of assault with intent to commit first degree criminal\r\n  sexual conduct with a minor.Â  Section 44-48-50 of the SVP Act states the\r\n  Director of the Department of Corrections â€œmust appoint a multidisciplinary\r\n  team to review the records of each person referred to the teamâ€ and that\r\n  â€œ[t]hese records may include, but are not limited to, the personâ€™s criminal\r\n    offense record, any relevant medical and psychological records, treatment\r\n  records, victimâ€™s impact statement, and any disciplinary or other records\r\n  formulated during confinement or supervision.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-50\r\n  (Supp. 2006) (emphasis added).Â  In the recent case of In re Care and\r\n    Treatment of White, 375 S.C. 1, 649 S.E.2d 172 (Ct. App. 2007), this court\r\n  observed that â€œoffenseâ€ is an ambiguous term because it is unclear whether\r\n  â€œoffenseâ€ refers to a conviction or whether it refers to the commission of a\r\n  crime.Â  Id. at 8, 649 S.E.2d at 176.Â  We noted the customary and usual\r\n  meaning of â€œoffenseâ€ is that it refers to a violation of the law, as\r\n  distinguished from a conviction, which is a judicial finding that someone is guilty\r\n  of a crime.Â  Id.Â  We further noted, â€œ[W]hile a conviction cannot occur without\r\n  the commission of an offense, an offense can occur without necessarily\r\n  resulting in a conviction.â€Â  Id. at 9, 649 S.E.2d at 176.Â  We concluded\r\n  that, â€œ[b]ecause the legislature fails to limit or is silent on whether\r\n  offenses can include only convictions, we must assume the legislature intended\r\n  to include both convictions and offenses not resulting in convictions.â€Â  Id.Â  Therefore, evidence of Wootenâ€™s alleged offense of assault with intent to\r\n  commit first degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor was relevant to the\r\n  probable cause determination.\r\n4. A SVP is defined under the SVP Act\r\n  as â€œa person who . . . (a) has been convicted of a sexually violent offense;\r\n  and (b) suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes\r\n  the person likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a\r\n  secure facility for long-term control, care, and treatment.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  44-48-30(1) (Supp. 2006).Â  At the hearing, the State offered evidence regarding\r\n  Wootenâ€™s past offenses, including a prior conviction for lewd act on a minor\r\n  and an unadjudicated offense of assault with intent to commit first degree\r\n  criminal sexual conduct with a minor.Â  Wootenâ€™s conviction for committing a\r\n  lewd act on a minor satisfies the first prong in the definition of a SVP.Â  See In re Care and Treatment of Beaver, 372 S.C. 272, 276-78, 642 S.E.2d 578,\r\n  580-81 (2007) (holding sufficient probable cause was established to find a\r\n  person convicted of committing a lewd act upon a minor met the definition of a\r\n  SVP and that a lewd act was a qualifying offense under the Act). The totality\r\n  of the evidence presented, including evidence of Wootenâ€™s unadjudicated conduct,\r\n  satisfies the statutory probable cause threshold that Wooten suffers from a\r\n  mental abnormality or personality disorder within the meaning of the SVP Act.Â \r\n  We conclude the State established probable cause under the SVP Act.\r\n5.&nbsp;We reverse the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  finding of no probable cause, and we remand for further proceedings under the\r\n  SVP Act as provided by law.Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., KITTREDGE and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n  \r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  During the hearing, the Assistant Attorney General\r\n  inadvertently referred to the date of conviction as being 1993, but the\r\n  supporting documentation indicates the plea was in 2003, and this date is used\r\n  by both parties in their appellate briefs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-066","title":"Protective Life v.

Stephen Welch, of Greenwood, and John S. Nichols, of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\n      J. Richard Kelly, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this\r\n  foreclosure action by a mortgage lender against a borrower and its general\r\n  partners, Protective Life Insurance Company seeks to recover deficiency\r\n  judgments against the borrowerâ€™s individual general partners under exceptions\r\n  to the contractual nonrecourse provision.Â  We affirm as modified.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOakdale\r\n  Investors, L.P. (Oakdale), is a South Carolina limited partnership whose\r\n  general partners were Webb Properties, Inc. (Webb Properties); HDC Corporation;\r\n  J. Patton Webb; and Thomas L. Hoofnagle (collectively Oakdale and its general\r\n  partners).Â  On July 22, 1994, Oakdale executed a promissory note for\r\n  $3,725,000.00 payable to Protective Life Insurance Company (Protective) and a\r\n  mortgage and security agreement granting Protective a security interest in\r\n  Oakdaleâ€™s real property known as the Oakdale Shopping Center (the Shopping\r\n  Center).Â  Oakdale assigned Protective the Shopping Centerâ€™s rents and leases.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  promissory note included a nonrecourse provision preserving Oakdale and its general\r\n  partners from â€œpersonal liability for the payment of the principal, interest,\r\n  prepayment fee or Premium, if any.â€Â  However, Oakdale and its individual general\r\n  partners could incur personal liability for â€œLenderâ€™s damage, loss, liability,\r\n  costs and expenses, plus interest,â€ in five circumstances.Â  Paragraph 4 of the\r\n  promissory note enumerated those circumstances, including â€œ(a) failure by\r\n  Borrower to perform the other obligations contained in the Loan Documents\r\n  including, but not limited to, the obligations to . . . pay ad valorem taxes\r\n  and assessmentsâ€ and â€œ(b) fraud or misrepresentation by Borrower (or any\r\n  general partner) to Lender prior to or during the term of this Note.â€Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Shopping Center property generated rental income sufficient to pay ordinary\r\n  expenses, including property taxes.Â  Spartanburg County notified Oakdale of the\r\n  2002 ad valorem taxes it levied on the Shopping Center.Â  Webb personally\r\n  received this notice on behalf of Oakdale, but he failed to pay the taxes.Â  Spartanburg   County notified Oakdale the Shopping Center would be sold at a tax sale.Â  Webb\r\n  personally received this notice as well but failed to notify Protective of the\r\n  tax delinquency or the tax sale.Â  \r\nSubsequently,\r\n  Spartanburg County sold the Shopping Center to Marin Properties, LLC, and\r\n  notified Oakdale it could redeem the property during a twelve-month redemption\r\n  period.Â  Webb received this notice on behalf of Oakdale but failed to notify\r\n  Protective of the redemption period.Â  Oakdale did not redeem the property\r\n  within the redemption period.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  March 29, 2005, Marin recorded a tax deed for the Shopping Center.Â  Marinâ€™s bid\r\n  exceeded the tax debt on the property by $883,729.50 (the Overbid Funds).Â  Webb\r\n  applied to Spartanburg County for the Overbid Funds and deposited them in\r\n  Oakdaleâ€™s checking account.Â  Later, Webb personally attempted to repurchase the\r\n  Shopping Center directly from Marin, using personal rather than partnership\r\n  funds.Â  Although Marin sent Webb a contract naming Webb Properties and not\r\n  Oakdale as the purchaser, Webb never executed the contract because he believed\r\n  Marinâ€™s price was too high and he was uncomfortable with the contract itself.Â  \r\nMarin\r\n  deeded the Shopping Center to ATFH Real Property, LLC (ATFH).Â  One month later,\r\n  Marin filed an action to quiet title to the Shopping Center.Â  Protective\r\n  responded and asserted its claims under the promissory note.Â  The circuit court\r\n  referred Marinâ€™s suit to the master for hearing and adjudication.Â  In response\r\n  to a motion by Protective, the master appointed a receiver for the property.Â  The\r\n  receiver took control of the Overbid Funds as well as the Shopping Centerâ€™s\r\n  income.Â  Due to Oakdaleâ€™s failure to make scheduled payments, Protective\r\n  invoked the promissory noteâ€™s acceleration provision against Oakdale.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  master set aside the tax sale due to defective notice.Â  Under a negotiated\r\n  agreement, the receiver disbursed the Overbid Funds to ATFH, and Marin and ATFH\r\n  executed quitclaim deeds to Oakdale.Â  With the tax sale issue resolved, the\r\n  master dismissed from the suit all parties except Protective, Oakdale, and\r\n  Oakdaleâ€™s general partners.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  September 15, 2006, the master entered judgment on the foreclosure action to\r\n  Protective and awarded Protective $3,727,460.98, plus interest, from Oakdale.Â  The\r\n  master ordered the property sold at auction, with the proceeds to be applied to\r\n  Oakdaleâ€™s entire debt.Â  The master found Oakdaleâ€™s failure to pay ad valorem\r\n  taxes on the property triggered an exception to the promissory noteâ€™s\r\n  nonrecourse provision.Â  Further, the master found $346,648.27 (the Tax Issue\r\n  Loss) of the grand total was attributable to Protectiveâ€™s efforts to resolve\r\n  the issues stemming from Oakdaleâ€™s failure to pay taxes timely.Â  As a result,\r\n  the master found joint and several liability among Oakdale and all its general\r\n  partners in an amount up to $346,648.27 for Protectiveâ€™s losses as a result of\r\n  Oakdaleâ€™s nonpayment of property taxes.Â  The master ruled Protective was\r\n  entitled to a deficiency judgment against the individual partners, jointly and\r\n  severally, for any portion of the Tax Issue Loss that remained unpaid after\r\n  sale of the property.Â  Moreover, the master found Webbâ€™s pursuit of the overbid\r\n  funds and a contract of sale with ATFH constituted fraud. Â As a result of the\r\n  fraud, the master found Protective entitled to a deficiency judgment against\r\n  Oakdale and each of its partners, jointly and severally, for both the Tax Issue\r\n  Losses and all sums owed under the terms of the note that remained unpaid after\r\n  sale of the property.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nActions\r\n  for foreclosure are actions in equity.Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 324 S.C.\r\n  570, 576-77, 479 S.E.2d 510, 513&nbsp;(1996).Â  In an\r\n    appeal from the final judgment of a master, the reviewing court applies the\r\n    same scope of review as if the appeal were from the circuit court without a\r\n    jury to the Supreme Court.Â  See Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc.,\r\n    301 S.C. 229, 237, 391 S.E.2d 538, 543&nbsp;(1990) (â€œOur scope of review for a\r\n    case heard by a Master-in-Equity who enters a final judgment is the same as\r\n    that for review of a case heard by a circuit court without a jury.â€); Wigfall\r\n      v. Fobbs, 295 S.C. 59, 60-61, 367 S.E.2d 156, 157&nbsp;(1988) (applying the\r\n    standard of review from a law case heard by the circuit court to a law case\r\n    heard by the master).Â  In an action in equity, tried by a master without a\r\n  jury, an appellate court may view the evidence to determine facts in accordance\r\n  with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Tiger, 301 S.C.\r\n  at 237, 391 S.E.2d at 543.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nOakdale,\r\n  Webb Properties, and Webb argue that the master erred in finding joint and\r\n  several liability on the basis of fraud.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nI. Fraud \r\nAs a\r\n  preliminary matter, we find that our review of this issue is governed by the\r\n  equitable standard enunciated above rather than by a legal standard triggered\r\n  by fraud.Â  We recognize that, when legal and equitable actions are maintained in one suit, each retains its own identity as legal\r\n  or equitable for purposes of the applicable standard of\r\n  review on appeal.Â  Corley v. Ott, 326 S.C. 89, 92, 485 S.E.2d 97,\r\n  99&nbsp;(1997).[2]Â \r\n  In determining whether a cause of action is at law or in equity:\r\n\r\n  [T]he\r\n    appellate court must look to the essential character of the cause of action\r\n    alleged by the petitioners in the court below.Â  If the essential character of\r\n    the petitionerâ€™s cause of action is grounded on equitable rights and equitable\r\n    relief is sought, the case is regarded as equitable and the appellate court has\r\n    jurisdiction to make findings in accordance with its own view of the\r\n    preponderance of the evidence.Â  \r\n\r\nDean v. Kilgore, 313 S.C. 257, 259, 437 S.E.2d 154, 155 (Ct. App.\r\n  1993).Â  However, in the case at bar, the fraud asserted is not an action at\r\n  law.Â  Protective asserted fraud by Oakdale and its general partners, not as a\r\n  separate cause of action arising out of a common event, but as a means of\r\n  invoking one of the contractual exceptions to the promissory noteâ€™s nonrecourse\r\n  provision.Â  The essential nature of this action is equitable. Â The assertion of\r\n  fraud here is inextricably part of the equitable claim for foreclosure.Â \r\n  Therefore, we will determine facts in accordance with our view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence.Â  Tiger, 301 S.C. at 237, 391 S.E.2d at\r\n  543.Â  Having decided the action is one in equity, we now turn to examine\r\n  whether the master erred in concluding Oakdale committed fraud.Â  \r\nOakdale\r\n  and its general partners had a fiduciary duty to disclose to Protective any\r\n  known threats to Protectiveâ€™s interest in the Shopping Center.Â  In South Carolina, a party to a transaction may assume a duty to disclose in three ways:Â  \r\n\r\n  First,\r\n    where it arises from a pre-existing definite fiduciary relation between the\r\n    parties; second where one party expressly reposes a trust and confidence in the\r\n    other with reference to the particular transaction in question, or else from\r\n    the circumstances of the case, the nature of their dealings, or their position\r\n    towards each other, such a trust and confidence in the particular case is\r\n    necessarily implied.Â  The third class includes those instances where the very\r\n    contract or transaction itself, in its essential nature, is intrinsically\r\n    fiduciary, and necessarily calls for perfect good faith and full disclosure,\r\n    without regard to any particular intention of the parties.Â  \r\n\r\nHolly Hill Lumber Co.,\r\n  Inc. v. McCoy, 201 S.C. 427, 437, 23\r\n  S.E.2d 372, 376 (1942).Â  The party acting as a fiduciary must have either\r\n  induced or actually accepted the other partyâ€™s trust.Â  Moore v. Moore,\r\n  360 S.C. 241, 251, 599 S.E.2d 467, 472 (Ct. App. 2004) (citing Regions Bank\r\n    v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 671, 582 S.E.2d 432, 444 (Ct. App. 2003)).Â  A mortgagor\r\n  in possession of mortgaged property occupies a fiduciary relation to the\r\n  property and is required to act in a manner that will not impair the rights of his\r\n  mortgagee.Â  Hill v. Winnsboro Granite Corp., 112 S.C. 243, 248, 99 S.E.\r\n  836, 838 (1919).Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  Oakdale, through its general partners, executed a mortgage, promissory note,\r\n  and security agreement granting Protective an interest in the Shopping Center,\r\n  as well as an assignment of rents and leases.Â  By executing these documents and\r\n  retaining possession of the Shopping Center, Oakdale and its general partners\r\n  manifested their acceptance of Protectiveâ€™s trust and, consequently, acceptance\r\n  of their fiduciary obligations to Protective.Â  Oakdale and its general partners\r\n  signified they promised not to impair Protectiveâ€™s rights to the Shopping\r\n  Center and assumed the duty to disclose to Protective any threats to its\r\n  interest in the property. Â \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Oakdale fraudulently concealed from Protective known threats to Protectiveâ€™s\r\n  interest in the property.Â  When a party to a transaction â€œconceals some fact\r\n  which is material, which is within his own knowledge, and which it is his duty\r\n  to disclose, he is guilty of actual fraud.â€Â  Holly Hill Lumber, 201 S.C.\r\n  at 436, 23 S.E.2d at 376.Â  Webb admitted he personally knew about Oakdaleâ€™s\r\n  failure to pay ad valorem taxes on the property, the tax sale of the property, and\r\n  the redemption period that followed the tax sale.Â  Webb further admitted he did\r\n  not notify Protective or its agent of any of these matters.Â  Oakdale and its\r\n  general partners had a duty to disclose to Protective threats against its interest\r\n  in the Shopping Center.Â  Because Webb knew about these threats, Webbâ€™s failure\r\n  disclose them to Protective constitutes fraud.Â  We therefore find Oakdale\r\n  committed actual fraud against Protective, triggering Paragraph 4(b) of the promissory\r\n  note.Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  we disagree with the masterâ€™s award of â€œa deficiency judgment for fraud both in\r\n  the amount of the Tax Issue Losses and in the amount of all other sums owed\r\n  Protective under the terms of the Note.â€Â  Paragraph 4(b), upon which liability\r\n  here is premised, does not obviate the nonrecourse provision entirely.Â  Rather,\r\n  it provides a limited exception to the rule against personal liability.Â  The\r\n  limited exception encompasses â€œLenderâ€™s damage, loss, liability, costs and\r\n  expenses,â€ along with interest.Â  It does not expose Oakdaleâ€™s partners to\r\n  personal liability for the â€œprincipal, interest, prepayment fee or Premium, if\r\n  any,â€ under the note.Â  Therefore, we find Oakdale and its general partners have\r\n  joint and several personal liability for the costs Protective incurred to\r\n  protect its rights, plus interest, but not for the principal amounts due under\r\n  the note.Â  \r\nII.Â Additional\r\n  Sustaining Grounds\r\nProtective\r\n  urges us to affirm the masterâ€™s judgment on additional sustaining grounds.[3]Â \r\n  We affirm the masterâ€™s judgment of joint and several liability based upon Oakdaleâ€™s\r\n  failure to pay ad valorem taxes on the property.Â  Paragraph 4(a) of the note\r\n  extends joint and several liability to Oakdaleâ€™s general partners for â€œfailure\r\n  . . . to . . . pay ad valorem taxes and assessments with respect to the\r\n  Property.â€Â  Personal liability under Paragraph 4(a) is the same limited\r\n  liability as under Paragraph 4(b).Â  Webb admitted to failing to pay these\r\n  taxes, and the master found personal, joint and several liability for the Tax\r\n  Issue Loss on this basis.Â  Therefore, under Paragraph 4(a) of the note, Oakdale\r\n  and its general partners incurred joint and several personal liability for the\r\n  Tax Issue Loss, plus interest, by failing to pay ad valorem taxes on the\r\n  Shopping Center.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  master did not err in finding Oakdale and its general partners personally\r\n  liable, both jointly and severally, to Protective under exceptions to the\r\n  nonrecourse provision in the note.Â  However, their personal liability extends\r\n  only to the amount of the Tax Issue Loss, plus interest.Â  A preponderance of\r\n  the evidence supports the masterâ€™s findings that Oakdale had a fiduciary duty\r\n  to notify Protective of known threats to Protectiveâ€™s interest in the Shopping\r\n  Center, Oakdale knew the Spartanburg County Tax Collector intended to sell the\r\n  property at a tax sale, and Oakdale fraudulently failed or refused to inform\r\n  Protective its interest in the property was in jeopardy.Â  Additionally, we find\r\n  Oakdale and its general partners incurred joint and several personal liability\r\n  under the note for Protectiveâ€™s Tax Issue Loss, plus interest, by failing to\r\n  pay ad valorem taxes levied on the property.Â  Accordingly, the order of the\r\n  master is \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  AS MODIFIED.\r\nHUFF\r\n  AND PIEPER, JJ., AND CURETON, AJ., CONCUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n[2] Where legal and equitable actions co-exist in the\r\n  same suit, the proper analysis is to view the actions separately for the\r\n  purpose of determining the appropriate standard of review.Â  Jordan v. Holt, 362 S.C. 201, 205, 608 S.E.2d 129, 131&nbsp;(2005).Â  An action for\r\n  fraud is an action at law, and a legal question in an equity case receives\r\n  review as in law.Â  Gunter v. Fallaw, 78 S.C. 457, 59 S.E. 70 (1907). Â An\r\n  appellate courtâ€™s scope of review in cases of fraud, where the proof must be by\r\n  clear, cogent and convincing evidence, is limited to determining whether there\r\n  is any evidence reasonably supporting the circuit courtâ€™s findings.Â  Kiriakides\r\n    v. Atlas Food Sys. &amp; Servs., Inc., 343 S.C. 587, 594, 541 S.E.2d 257,\r\n  261&nbsp;(2001).\r\n[3] â€œUnder the present rules, a respondent - the â€˜winnerâ€™\r\n  in the lower court - may raise on appeal any additional reasons the appellate\r\n  court should affirm the lower courtâ€™s ruling, regardless of whether those\r\n  reasons have been presented to or ruled on by the lower court.â€Â  Iâ€™On,\r\n    L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 419, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723\r\n  (2000).Â  Similarly, a respondentâ€™s failure to raise an additional sustaining\r\n  ground in its appellate brief constitutes abandonment of that ground.Â  Id.Â  However, the basis for a respondentâ€™s additional sustaining grounds must appear\r\n  in the record on appeal.Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-067","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Harold M. Coombs,\r\n  Jr., Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia;\r\n  and Solicitor I. McDuffie Stone, III, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Curtis Scott was convicted of\r\n  attempted armed robbery and sentenced to thirteen years in prison.Â  He appeals,\r\n  arguing the trial court erred in admitting the in-court identifications of him\r\n  because they were based upon an unduly suggestive pretrial identification\r\n  procedure and were not otherwise reliable.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  Â \r\nI.\r\nScott was charged with attempting to rob Miguel Leyva\r\n  of his wallet in the parking lot of a Food Lion in Ridgeland, South Carolina.Â \r\n  Both Leyva and Shawnricka Burrison, a store employee who observed the incident,\r\n  picked Scott out of a photographic lineup shortly after the incident, and they\r\n  again identified Scott at trial as the perpetrator.Â   \r\nPrior\r\n  to trial, Scott made a motion to exclude the identifications of the two\r\n  eyewitnesses.Â  During the in limine hearing on the motion, Leyva, who speaks\r\n  little English, testified through an interpreter that a man approached him in\r\n  the parking lot and asked him for a cigarette, and he told the man he didnâ€™t\r\n  smoke.Â  The man then got inside Leyvaâ€™s car, pulled a gun on him, and asked for\r\n  his wallet.Â  Leyva opened the car door, hit the man with his arm, and then ran\r\n  towards the Food Lion while calling 9-1-1 on his cell phone.Â  Burrison\r\n  testified that she had walked outside the store on her break when she observed\r\n  the conflict between Leyva and the other man.Â  She stated the perpetrator was\r\n  wearing a red jersey shirt and blue jeans and appeared to be harassing the victim.Â \r\n  Burrison stated once the victim appeared to be attracting attention, the\r\n  perpetrator shoved something into the waistband of his pants and then ran\r\n  behind the store.Â  Burrison advised her store manager about the problem and the\r\n  manager called the police.Â  Burrison stated she had seen the perpetrator before\r\n  because he had come into the store on prior occasions, but she did not know his\r\n  name.Â   \r\nThe police prepared\r\n  two photo lineups.Â  The first lineup, prepared shortly after the incident,\r\n  consisted of photos of people the police thought were likely to have committed\r\n  the crime.Â  Scottâ€™s photo was not included in the first lineup.Â  A few days\r\n  later, after receiving several tips, the police presented seven photos in a\r\n  stack to Leyva and Burrison and each positively identified Scott as the\r\n  perpetrator.Â  The officer who presented the photos, Michael Ballenski,\r\n  testified that he did not suggest anything to the witnesses when they viewed\r\n  the photos and simply handed them the stack of photos and asked if the person\r\n  who had attempted the robbery was in any of the photos.Â  He stated Burrison\r\n  â€œimmediatelyâ€ identified Scott as the person she saw at the store.Â  Burrison\r\n  signed the back of the photo to indicate she had identified Scott.Â  The officer\r\n  stated Leyva was then shown the photos.Â  Burrison was not present.Â  Once Leyva\r\n  identified Scott as the person who had attempted to rob him, the photo was then\r\n  turned over for Leyva to sign.Â  The officer explained that the witnesses were\r\n  not together when the identifications were made, and Leyva could not see\r\n  Burrisonâ€™s identification before he made his own identification of Scott.Â \r\n \r\nAt the in limine\r\n  hearing, Burrison testified that she was handed a stack of photos and they were\r\n  not in any particular order.Â  Burrison stated she looked at all of them and\r\n  recognized Scott as the robber.Â  Burrison stated the officer stood back while\r\n  she looked at the photos so she could not ask him any questions.Â  Burrison\r\n  stated there was nothing about any of the photographs that focused particular\r\n  attention on any of them and that she â€œreviewed them all the same.â€Â  She stated\r\n  her identification was based on what she had seen during the incident.Â  Â Â \r\nLeyva testified\r\n  through an interpreter and stated when he saw the second set of photos the\r\n  officer stated only, â€œIâ€™m bringing you a couple of more pictures to see if you\r\n  can identify the person that did whatever happened.â€Â  When asked if there was\r\n  anything said or done to make one photo any more or less special, Leyva stated\r\n  â€œ[t]hey were all normal pictures.â€Â  Leyva said he recognized Scott in the\r\n  second set of photographs and after he identified Scott, the officer then told\r\n  him he needed to sign the back of the photo.Â  Leyva stated he did not see the\r\n  back of the photo prior to turning it over to sign it.Â   \r\nThe trial judge,\r\n  while noting the police could have done some things better, found â€œas a fact\r\n  that under . . . all the circumstances of this case . . . this identification\r\n  by both witnesses was reliableâ€ and ruled that their testimony as to identity\r\n  would be admissible at trial.Â  Scott was subsequently convicted as charged.\r\nII.\r\nOn appeal, Scott contends the trial judge erred in\r\n  admitting the in-court identifications of him because they were based upon an\r\n  unduly suggestive pretrial identification procedure and the identifications\r\n  were not otherwise reliable under Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188 (1972).\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  United States Supreme Court has developed a two-prong inquiry [in Neil v.\r\n    Biggers] to determine the admissibility of an out-of-court identification.â€Â  State v. Brown,&nbsp;356 S.C. 496, 503, 589 S.E.2d 781, 784&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 2003).Â  â€œFirst, a court must ascertain whether the identification process\r\n  was unduly suggestive.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œThe court must next decide whether the\r\n  out-of-court identification was nevertheless so reliable that no substantial\r\n  likelihood of misidentification existed.â€Â  Id.\r\nÂ â€œEven assuming an identification procedure is suggestive, it need not be excluded so long as, under all the\r\n  circumstances, the identification was reliable notwithstanding the suggestiveness.â€Â  State v. Traylor,&nbsp;360\r\n  S.C. 74, 82, 600 S.E.2d 523, 527&nbsp;(2004).Â  â€œThe inquiry must focus upon\r\n  whether, under the totality of the circumstances, there was a substantial\r\n  likelihood of irreparable misidentification.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œThe following\r\n  factors should be considered in evaluating the totality of the circumstances to\r\n  determine the likelihood of a misidentification:Â  (1) the witnessâ€™s opportunity\r\n  to view the perpetrator at the time of the crime, (2) the witnessâ€™s degree of\r\n  attention, (3) the accuracy of the witnessâ€™s prior description of the\r\n  perpetrator, (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the\r\n  confrontation, and (5) the length of time between the crime and the\r\n  confrontation.â€Â  Id.\r\nâ€œGenerally,\r\n  the decision to admit an eyewitness identification is in the trial judgeâ€™s\r\n  discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion,\r\n  or the commission of prejudicial legal error.â€Â  Brown,&nbsp;356 S.C. at\r\n  502, 589 S.E.2d at 784.\r\nScott argues the\r\n  photos were unduly suggestive because Scott â€œwas the only person in the photos\r\n  wearing a white undershirt, was the only one who[se] photo was vertically\r\n  oriented, was the only one in front of a bulletin board that read â€œSecure at\r\n  all time,â€ was in the only photo without a computer-generated name printed on\r\n  his photo, and was depicted in the largest photograph.Â  Scott also contends the\r\n  paper is lightweight so Burrisonâ€™s signature could â€œeasily be seen by Leyva,\r\n  influencing his choice.â€Â  Finally, Scott contends Burrison knew of two of the\r\n  people in the photo lineup and that three of them shared her same last name.Â  Â Â \r\nAfter reviewing the\r\n  photo lineup, it appears the trial judge properly exercised his discretion in\r\n  ruling the identifications were admissible.Â  Scottâ€™s arguments, while numerous,\r\n  are ultimately without merit.Â  The photos are all on plain paper that is 8Â½ by\r\n  11 inches, one sheet for each suspect, and each sheet has two photos of that\r\n  suspect, a front view and a side view.Â  Although Scottâ€™s photos are oriented in\r\n  a different direction on the page from the majority, another suspectâ€™s photos\r\n  also are oriented differently from the others and there is a double border\r\n  around the photos, so there is nothing remarkable about Scottâ€™s photos.Â  As\r\n  noted by both witnesses, Scottâ€™s photos appear to be normal and nothing makes\r\n  his stand out from the others.Â   \r\nFurther,\r\n  contrary to Scottâ€™s argument, his photo is not larger than all of the others.Â \r\n  Rather, it is the same size as at least one other suspect, and there is not\r\n  much difference between the sizes, in any event.Â  Moreover, his is not the only\r\n  photo that does not have a name on it.Â  Scott is wearing a white undershirt,\r\n  that is true, but all of the other individuals except one are wearing a white\r\n  undershirt with another T-shirt over it.Â  In fact, one individual is wearing a\r\n  red T-shirt, the same color as the perpetrator.Â  The bulletin board Scott\r\n  refers to is so blurry as to be unreadable, and the wording he references is,\r\n  for the most part, obscured behind Scottâ€™s head and does not actually appear in\r\n  full on the photo as he alleges.Â  As to the signatures, the only evidence in\r\n  the record is that Leyva was not present when Burrison made her identification\r\n  and he did not see Burrisonâ€™s identification before making his own identification\r\n  of Scott.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  only arguable issue with the lineup appears to be the fact that people with the\r\n  same last name as one of the witnesses appeared in the lineup.Â  There are\r\n  photos of a Marcus Burrison, a Nathaniel Burrison, and a Gil Nathaniel Burrison.Â \r\n  Burrison stated she was not related to Marcus Burrison and she knew of the\r\n  others.Â  (It is unclear from the record whether the last two might even be the\r\n  same person as the names and photos are similar and Scott notes in his brief\r\n  that Nathaniel Burrison and Gil Nathaniel Burrison appear to be the same\r\n  person.)Â  However, while the lineup could arguably be deemed suggestive, we\r\n  hold it is not unduly suggestive, which is the applicable standard.Â  See State v. Turner, 373 S.C. 121, 644 S.E.2d 693 (2007) (stating the fact\r\n  that a suspectâ€™s photo is in color and the others are in black and white or that\r\n  the suspectâ€™s photo is larger or in a different position on the page is not\r\n  unduly suggestive; the court noted the trial judgeâ€™s observation that there\r\n  will always be differences found in photos); State v. Govan,&nbsp;372\r\n  S.C. 552, 643 S.E.2d 92 (Ct. App. 2007) (stating although the showup\r\n  identification procedure in that case was suggestive, it was not unduly\r\n  suggestive under the test articulated in Neil v. Biggers).  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  even assuming the photos are unduly suggestive, however, the inquiry then\r\n  focuses on whether, under the totality of the circumstances, they were\r\n  nevertheless reliable.Â  It is evident from the testimony of the witnesses that\r\n  they each had ample opportunity to view Scott, Burrison had even seen him at\r\n  the store before, and they were uniformly certain in their identifications.Â \r\n  The incident occurred at close range in broad daylight, and both Leyva and\r\n  Burrison were focused on the acts of the perpetrator.Â  The officer stated\r\n  Burrison â€œimmediatelyâ€ identified Scott after viewing the photos, and there is\r\n  no evidence that Leyva was influenced in his selection of Scott.Â  As noted by\r\n  the trial judge, the officers certainly could have done some things differently\r\n  in preparing the photo lineup, but in looking at the totality of the\r\n  circumstances there is not a very substantial likelihood of misidentification\r\n  in this case.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\r\n  admitting the identifications of Scott.\r\nIII.\r\nScottâ€™s conviction and sentence are,\r\n  therefore,\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-069","title":"State v.

Michael Baxley, Circuit Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2008-UP-069\r\nHeard January 8, 2008 â€“ Filed January 23,\r\n  2008Â Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tAppellate Defender Kathrine H. Hudgins, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney\r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior\r\n  Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; and Solicitor\r\n  Jay Hodge, Fourth Circuit Solicitorâ€™s Office, of Cheraw, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: John Daniel Springer (Springer) appeals his conviction\r\n  and sentence for two counts each of first-degree criminal sexual assault with a\r\n  minor, committing a lewd act on a minor, and contributing to the delinquency of\r\n  a minor.Â  Springer alleges the trial court erred in improperly joining and\r\n  refusing to sever cases involving separate alleged incidents and different\r\n  victims.Â  We affirm.Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nIn\r\n  February 2002, Officer Dennis Carter took an incident report identifying\r\n  alleged sexual assaults by Springer on his daughter (Jane Doe) and niece (Jane\r\n  Roe).[1]Â \r\n  Based on the evidence gathered through the subsequent investigation, Springer\r\n  was arrested and charged with various criminal acts against the victims. \r\n \r\nPrior\r\n  to trial, Springer filed a motion to sever the trials involving the alleged\r\n  crimes against the victims.Â  At a pre-trial hearing, Springer argued the cases\r\n  did not contain sufficient similarities to warrant consolidation.Â  The trial\r\n  court denied Springerâ€™s motion to sever.Â  The trial court found the cases\r\n  involving the victims were â€œvery similar,â€ including similarities in the\r\n  nature, location, and execution of the alleged acts.Â  In addition, the trial court\r\n  acknowledged each victim would be a witness in the otherâ€™s case.Â  Based on this\r\n  reasoning, the trial court held the cases should be consolidated.Â   \r\nFor\r\n  acts committed against Jane Doe and Jane Roe, the jury found Springer guilty of\r\n  two counts each of first-degree criminal sexual assault with a minor,\r\n  committing a lewd act on a minor, and contributing to the delinquency of a\r\n  minor.Â  The trial court sentenced Springer to thirty years imprisonment for\r\n  each of the charges of first degree criminal sexual assault with a minor,\r\n  fifteen years for each of the charges of committing a lewd act on a minor, and\r\n  three years for each of the charges of contributing to the delinquency of a\r\n  minor, all to run concurrently.Â   \r\nPursuant\r\n  to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), counsel for Springer\r\n  attached to the final brief a petition to be relieved as counsel, stating she\r\n  reviewed the record and concluded the appeal was without legal merit sufficient\r\n  to warrant a new trial.Â  After a thorough review of the record, we ordered the\r\n  parties to brief whether the circuit court improperly consolidated the\r\n  charges.Â  Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  trial court has broad discretion when determining whether to consolidate\r\n  charges for trial.Â  State v. Grace, 350 S.C. 19, 23, 564 S.E.2d 331, 333\r\n  (Ct. App. 2002).Â  The trial courtâ€™s decision will be reversed if an abuse of\r\n  discretion has occurred.Â  Id.Â  Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe\r\n  trial judge has the power, in his discretion, to order offenses charged in\r\n  separate indictments to be tried together when the offenses are of the same\r\n  general nature involving connected transactions closely related in kind, place,\r\n  and character, and the defendantâ€™s substantive rights would not be prejudiced.Â  State\r\n    v. Simmons, 352 S.C. 342, 350, 573 S.E.2d 856, 860 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\n \r\nâ€œOffenses\r\n  are considered to be of the same general nature where they are\r\n  interconnected.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œConversely, offenses which are of the same\r\n  nature, but which do not arise out of a single chain of circumstances and are\r\n  not provable by the same evidence may not properly be tried together.â€Â  State v. Jones,\r\n  325 S.C. 310, 315, 479 S.E.2d 517, 519 (Ct. App. 1996).Â   \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the Supreme Court of South Carolina has held, â€œCharges can be joined in the\r\n  same indictment and tried together where they (1) arise out of a single chain\r\n  of circumstances, (2) are proved by the same evidence, (3) are of the same\r\n  general nature, and (4) no real right of the defendant has been prejudiced.â€Â  State\r\n    v. Harris, 351 S.C. 643, 652, 572 S.E.2d 267, 272 (2002).Â  The court may\r\n  consolidate trials involving multiple defendants, multiple victims, or both.Â  See Jones, 325 S.C. at 313-16, 479 S.E.2d at 518-20 (holding consolidation\r\n  of cases against two adults involving the sexual abuse of two minor victims was\r\n  proper).Â   \r\nIn\r\n  the present case, the charges arise out of a single chain of circumstances.Â  Jane\r\n  Doe and Jane Roe, both young females, were assaulted in Springerâ€™s home.Â  The\r\n  young victims were assaulted at night.Â  The girls were assaulted at times when\r\n  others were present in the house. The victims are related to Springer.Â  Additionally,\r\n  the acts committed against the victims were of the same general nature,\r\n  including vaginal fondling and performing cunnilingus.Â   \r\nThe charges\r\n  are proved by the same evidence.Â  For example, Jane Doe and Jane Roe would\r\n  argue about which side of the bed each would sleep.Â  The bed in which the\r\n  victims slept was a bunk bed.Â  The bed was positioned such that it was placed against\r\n  the wall of the bedroom.Â  Consequently, one side of the bed was up against the\r\n  wall, while the other side was open to the bedroom.Â  The victims would sleep\r\n  together in the bottom part of the bunk bed.Â  Jane Roe testified that she and\r\n  Jane Doe would argue as to which one would sleep on the side of the bed facing\r\n  the wall.Â  The desire of each victim to sleep on the inside of the bed was fueled\r\n  by their wish to escape the possibility of sexual abuse during the night by\r\n  Springer.  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  Jane Doe testified to an occurrence during which Springer entered the bedroom and\r\n  sexually abused Jane Roe.Â  Jane Doe testified that during the night, Springer entered\r\n  the bedroom when the victims were asleep.Â  Jane Doe stated, â€œI thought it was\r\n  just a dream but it wasnâ€™t because in the morning, I woke up and [Jane Roe] was\r\n  acting all weird.â€Â  Jane Roe, in describing this occasion, testified that\r\n  â€œ[Springer] came in and I was [a]sleep on the outside [of the bed] because\r\n  [Jane Doe] was sleeping on the inside.Â  [Springer] just touched my private.â€Â \r\n  When asked whether she informed anyone, Jane Roe responded, â€œI remember I told\r\n  [Jane Doe], but she told me it happened to her, but she never said what\r\n  happened to her.â€Â  The foregoing demonstrates that Jane Doe and Jane Roe were\r\n  necessary witnesses to corroborate the circumstances of sexual abuse that\r\n  occurred to each other.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  final factor to consider in determining whether consolidation is warranted is\r\n  if any real right of the defendant has been prejudiced.Â  Springer argues consolidation\r\n  prevented him from calling his wife (Wife) as a material witness for charges\r\n  relating to Jane Roe.Â  Wife was charged with unlawful neglect involving Jane\r\n  Doe.Â  During trial, Wife was called as a witness.Â  However, Wife refused to\r\n  testify on the grounds of her Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.Â  Springer\r\n  contends consolidation prevented him from calling Wife as a witness for charges\r\n  involving Jane Roe because Wife was charged with unlawful neglect involving\r\n  only Jane Doe.Â   \r\nEven\r\n  if Springer was tried separately, and Wife testified as a witness for charges\r\n  relating to Jane Roe, there is sufficient evidence to conclude the trial judge\r\n  did not abuse his discretion in consolidating the charges.Â  In addition to Jane\r\n  Doeâ€™s and Jane Roeâ€™s testimony described above, Jane Roe gave additional testimony\r\n  which described in graphic detail Springerâ€™s acts.\r\n\r\n\tQ: Was there ever a time when something\r\n  happened that made you feel uncomfortable?\r\n\tA: Yes, maâ€™am.\r\n\tQ: Can you tell us what you remember about\r\n  that?\r\n\tA: Yes, maâ€™am.Â  [Springer] would touch and\r\n  lick my private.\r\n\t. . . \r\n\tQ: And has that happened one time or more\r\n  than one time?\r\n\tA: More than once.\r\n\t. . . \r\n\tQ: I want to ask you about one of the\r\n  first times you remember something happening, and can you kind of just describe\r\n  where you were when it first started?\r\n\tA: I donâ€™t remember where, but I remember\r\n  what happened. \r\n\tQ: Okay. Can you tell us about that? \r\n\tA: [Springer] would just touch my private.\r\n\tQ: About how old were you when this first\r\n  started to happen?\r\n\tA: Eight or nine.\r\n\t. . . \r\n\tQ: Would these things normally happen in\r\n  the daytime or nighttime? \r\n\tA: Nighttime.\r\n\tQ: What do you remember about that?\r\n\tA: Iâ€™d be sleep, [sic] and [Springer\r\n  would] just wake me up.\r\n\tQ: How would you wake up?\r\n\tA: With him touching me. \r\n\tQ: And would that be on top or underneath\r\n  your clothes? \r\n\tA: Underneath.\r\n\tQ: Can you tell us what part or parts of\r\n  your body?\r\n\tA: My private. \r\n\t. . . \r\n\tQ: And did he touch your private part one\r\n  time or more than one time? \r\n\tA: More than one time. \r\n\tQ: Okay. I need to ask you if you can\r\n  describe what kind of touching that was. \r\n\tA: He just rubbed my private.\r\n\tQ: Okay. Can you tell us what you mean by\r\n  rubbing on your private. What part of your private? \r\n\tA: It was the outside. \r\n\tQ: Okay.Â  You said before that something\r\n  else had happened to your private? \r\n\tA: Yes, maâ€™am.\r\n\tQ: Okay. Can you tell us what that was? \r\n\tA: He would lick inside my private. \r\n\r\nÂ Additionally,\r\n  our decision to affirm the trial court is supported by case law.Â  In Jones,\r\n  two appellants were indicted on numerous charges arising out of their sexual\r\n  abuse of two minors.Â  Id. at 313-14, 479 S.E.2d at 518-19.Â  The abuse of\r\n  the minors occurred in December 1991, January 1992, and September 1992.Â  Id.Â  The trial court consolidated the charges against each appellant into one of two\r\n  indictments, and they were tried jointly on each charge.Â  Id.Â  Consequently,\r\n  the appellants were each convicted of three counts of first-degree criminal\r\n  sexual conduct, two counts of second-degree criminal sexual conduct, five\r\n  counts of criminal conspiracy, and one count of contributing to the delinquency\r\n  of a minor.Â  Id.\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, one of the issues presented was whether the trial court improperly\r\n  consolidated the case.Â  Id. at 314-15, 479 S.E.2d at 519-20.Â  This Court,\r\n  in affirming the trial court, held the charged offenses were of the same\r\n  general nature involving allegations of a pattern of sexual abuse involving the\r\n  two minor victims.Â  Id.Â  We also noted the evidence presented showed\r\n  both victims had been taken to the same locations and were present in the same\r\n  motel room on an occasion of abuse.Â  Id.Â   \r\nAs\r\n  explained above, the record indicates similarities exist in the assaults\r\n  against the victims.Â  Jane Doe and Jane Roe were assaulted in Springerâ€™s home.Â \r\n  Both were assaulted in the nighttime. Both were assaulted at times when others\r\n  were present in the house, and some of the acts committed against the victims\r\n  were similar in nature, including vaginal fondling and performing cunnilingus.Â  See State\r\n    v.

(Burriss) appeals from a South Carolina Occupational Safety\r\n  and Health Review Board (the Review Board) decision finding Burriss in willful\r\n  violation of the South Carolina Occupational Safety and Health Regulation 71, 1-1926.651(k)(1)(1991)[1].Â  After two employees were killed\r\n  when a vertical wall of an earthen trench collapsed, the Office of Occupational\r\n  Safety and Health in the South Carolina Department of Labor, Licensing and\r\n  Regulation (the Department) cited Burriss for four serious violations and one\r\n  willful violation of the South Carolina Occupational Safety and Health\r\n  Regulation (the Act).Â  Burriss appeals the citation for the willful violation,\r\n  arguing that (1) the Review Board misapplied the legal standard for willful conduct\r\n  in reaching a finding of willfulness; and (2) under an appropriate application\r\n  of the standard there exists no substantial evidence to support a finding\r\n  Burriss committed a willful violation.Â  We affirm.[2]Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nBurriss is an electrical systems\r\n  contractor.[3] Â During 2002 and 2003, Burriss served as the electrical contractor for the\r\n  building of the Blythewood High School in Blythewood, South Carolina.Â  At the Blythewood\r\n  site, Burriss dug a trench approximately 121 feet long in order to install\r\n  feeder conduit for power and data communications underneath the building. Â Roughly\r\n  eighty feet of the trench measured from six to eight feet deep, making that\r\n  portion of the trench wall essentially vertical. Â Â \r\nOn the\r\n  morning of January 28, 2003, a portion of the trench wall collapsed on several Burriss employees working in the trench.Â  The cave-in partially buried two of\r\n  the employees and caused their deaths.Â  The Department sent an inspector to\r\n  conduct a fatality inspection of Burrissâ€™ Blythewood site.Â  As a result of the\r\n  inspection, Burriss was cited for four serious violations (Citation 3 parts 1,\r\n  2, 3, and 4) and one willful violation (Citation 4).[4]Â  The violations are as follows:  \r\n\r\n\tCitation 3 (Serious) \r\n\t1. SCCR 71, 1-1926.21(b)(2) - Failure to instruct each\r\n  employee in the recognition and avoidance of unsafe conditions. . . no trench\r\n  hazard recognition [or] avoidance safety training provided to employees in\r\n  trench in excess of 7 feet deep . . . \r\n\t2. SCCR 71, 1-1926.100(a) - Failure to require employees\r\n  working in areas where there is a possibility of head injury . . . to be protected\r\n  by helmets [in that] . . . no protective helmets [were] worn by 4 employees in [a]\r\n  trench in excess of 7 feet deep . . .\r\n\t3. SCCR 71, 1-1926.651(c)(2) - Failed to locate a stairway,\r\n  ladder, ramp or other safe means of egress in trench excavation that are 4 feet\r\n  or more in depth . . . \r\n\t4. SCCR 71, 1-1926.652(a)(1) - Failed to protect each\r\n  employee in an excavation from cave-in by an adequate protection system [and] \r\n\tSCCR\r\n    71, 1-1926.652(b)(1)(i) - Failed to slope excavations at an angle not\r\n  steeper than one and one-half horizontal to one vertical . . .\r\n\tCitation 4 (Willful) \r\n\t1. SCCR 71, 1-1926.651(k)(1) - Failure to make daily\r\n  inspections of excavations . . . by a competent person for evidence of a\r\n  situation that could result in possible cave-ins, . . .\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A\r\n  competent person is defined by the Act as:  \r\n\r\n\t[O]ne who is capable of identifying existing and predictable\r\n  hazards in the surroundings, or working conditions which are unsanitary,\r\n  hazardous, or dangerous to employees, and who has authorization to take prompt\r\n  corrective measures to eliminate them.Â  In order to be a competent person for\r\n  the purpose of this standard one must have had special training in, and be\r\n  knowledgeable about soils analysis . . . the use of protective systems, and the\r\n  requirements of this standard.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Regs. 71, 1-1926.650(b) (1991).  \r\nBurriss\r\n  filed a notice of protest and a hearing was held before a single Review Board\r\n  member.Â  At the hearing, Burriss did not contest the four serious violations\r\n  under Citation 3.Â  The only issue before the Review Board member was the classification\r\n  of a willful violation under Citation 4.Â   \r\nAt the\r\n  hearing, Tommy Burriss testified he had been to the Blythewood site a week\r\n  prior to the excavation of the trench.Â  He stated it was his understanding the trench\r\n  was to be just over three feet deep. Â He further testified when he finally saw\r\n  the trench on the day of the cave-in he was â€œextremely shocked to see that\r\n  ditch that deep.â€ Â He said â€œ[i]t was horrifyingâ€ and â€œdangerous.â€ Â He stated\r\n  that had he been at the site he â€œwould have told people to get out of [the]\r\n  ditch . . . [t]hereâ€™s just no way [he] would have exposed anybody to that.â€Â \r\n \r\nWhen\r\n  asked whether, at the time of the cave-in, he was aware of the Actâ€™s trenching\r\n  regulations requiring a competent person to perform daily inspections, Tommy Burriss stated he was not aware of the regulations, nor did he have a copy of\r\n  the OSHA standards, general standards, or construction standards.Â  Yet, Tommy\r\n  Burriss was questioned about an August 2000 citation issued at a Burrissâ€™ worksite\r\n  at Stiversâ€™ Jeep. Â Burriss had both erected scaffolding and dug a trench at the\r\n  Stiversâ€™ Jeep worksite.Â  With respect to the scaffolding, the Department cited\r\n  Burriss for failure to install a guardrail along the sides and end of the\r\n  scaffolding platforms, classified the violation as â€œserious,â€ and proposed a\r\n  $300 fine.Â  With respect to the trench, the Department cited Burriss for\r\n  failure to perform daily inspections by a competent person pursuant to Regulation\r\n  71, 1-1926.651(k)(1) of the South Carolina Code.Â  The Department classified the\r\n  violation as â€œother than seriousâ€ and did not impose a fine therefor.Â  Burriss\r\n  protested the citation for the scaffolding violation and eventually entered a\r\n  settlement agreement wherein Burriss agreed to pay a $120 fine and â€œprovide\r\n  refresher training for its employees in fall protection.â€Â  But, because no\r\n  penalty was proposed for the citation for the trench violation, Burriss did not\r\n  protest the trench violation.Â   \r\nTommy Burriss admitted he read the Stiversâ€™ Jeep citation for lack of a competent\r\n  person.Â  Yet, at the time of the Blythewood site accident, Tommy Burriss\r\n  testified he maintained the belief his site superintendant, David Marshall was\r\n  â€œa competent person upon my definition.â€Â  He admitted at the hearing, in\r\n  hindsight, â€œnow I know what a competent person definition is by OSHA and my\r\n  competent person definition are two different things.â€\r\nThe\r\n  Review Board member upheld the â€œwillfulâ€ classification in Citation 4.Â  Burriss\r\n  filed a petition for review by the entire Review Board.Â  The petition was denied.Â \r\n  Burriss then appealed the matter to the circuit court. Â The circuit court\r\n  affirmed the Review Boardâ€™s denial of discretionary review as well as the Review\r\n  Board memberâ€™s order upholding the citation and corresponding penalty.Â  This\r\n  appeal follows.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis courtâ€™s review\r\n  of an administrative agencyâ€™s findings of fact is limited.Â  The court â€œshall\r\n  not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the\r\n  evidence on questions of factâ€ when those facts are supported by substantial\r\n  evidence.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§1-23-380(A)(6) (2005)[5]; Dorman v. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 350 S.C. 159, 164-65,\r\n  565 S.E.2d 119, 122 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  In determining whether the agencyâ€™s\r\n  decision was supported by substantial evidence, this court need only find,\r\n  looking at the entire record on appeal, evidence from which reasonable minds\r\n  could reach the same conclusion that the administrative agency reached.Â  DuRant\r\n    v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 361 S.C. 416, 420, 604 S.E.2d\r\n  704, 706-07 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The mere possibility of drawing two inconsistent\r\n  conclusions from the evidence does not prevent a finding from being supported\r\n  by substantial evidence.Â  Id. at 420, 604 S.E.2d at 707.Â  Further, the\r\n  burden is on the appellant to prove convincingly that the agencyâ€™s decision is\r\n  unsupported by the evidence.Â  See Waters v. S.C. Land Res. Conservation Commâ€™n, 321 S.C. 219, 226, 467 S.E.2d 913, 917 (1996).\r\nA court can reverse\r\n  an agencyâ€™s findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions if they are\r\n  â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence\r\n  on the whole record,â€ or â€œarbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of\r\n  discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§1-23-380(A)(6) (2005).Â  Further, a court may reverse where an agencyâ€™s\r\n  decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Id.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBurriss\r\n  asserts the circuit court misapplied the legal standard for a willful violation\r\n  and argues, under an appropriate application of the standard, there is no substantial evidence to sustain\r\n  a citation for a willful violation of the Act.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Act\r\n  itself does not define â€œwillfulâ€ nor has this court had an opportunity to\r\n  interpret its meaning. Â In its decision, the Review Board member defined a\r\n  willful violation as â€œcommitted voluntarily with intentional disregard or demonstrated plain indifference to the Act,â€ citing Occupational Safety\r\n  and Health Law, Mark A. Rothstein, Westâ€™s Employment Law Series, St. Paul,\r\n  Minn. 1998, Â§315.Â  See also Valdak Corp. v. Occupational Safety and\r\n    Health Review Commâ€™n, 73 F.3d 1466, 1468 (8th Cir. 1996) (finding to\r\n  support a classification of â€œwillfulâ€ there must be substantial evidence the\r\n  employer, intentionally disregarded or was plainly indifferent to the\r\n  requirements of the Act); Intercounty Constr. Co. v. Occupational Safety and\r\n    Health Commâ€™n, 522 F.2d 777, 780 (4th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 423\r\n  U.S. 1072 (1976).Â  When faced with a problem of statutory construction, we\r\n  accord great deference to the interpretation given the statute by the agency\r\n  charged with its administration.Â  See Dunton v. S.C. Bd. of Examâ€™rs\r\n    in Optometry, 291 S.C. 221, 223, 353 S.E.2d 132, 133 (1987) (â€œThe\r\n  construction of a statute by the agency charged with its administration will be\r\n  accorded the most respectful consideration and will not be overruled absent\r\n  compelling reasons.â€).Â   \r\nIn\r\n  the context of occupational safety and health laws, willfulness requires more\r\n  than the constructive knowledge or mere knowledge that would suffice for a\r\n  non-willful violation, but does not require a showing of malicious intent.Â  Intercounty\r\n    Constr. Co., 522 F.2d at 780, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1072 (1976).Â  â€œAn act may be â€˜willfulâ€™ if the offender shows â€˜indifferenceâ€™ to the rules; he\r\n  need not be consciously aware that the conduct is forbidden at the time he\r\n  performs it, but his state of mind must be such that, if he were informed of\r\n  the rule, he would not care.â€Â  AJP Constr., Inc. v. Sec. of Labor,Â  357\r\n  F.3d 70, 74 (D.C. Cir. 2004)(citation omitted).Â   \r\nEmployers\r\n  are presumed to be familiar with standards that affect their business;\r\n  therefore, ignorance or even misunderstanding of the standards does not excuse\r\n  noncompliance.Â  Sec. of Labor v. Hallmark Excavating, Inc., 6 OSHC 1898\r\n  (1978).Â  Similarly, an omission or failure to act is willful, if it is done\r\n  voluntarily and intentionally.Â  Havens Steel Co. v. Occupational Safety and\r\n    Health Commâ€™n, 738 F.2d 397, 401 (10th Cir. 1984).Â  Furthermore, a prior\r\n  warning from OSHA may be a factor in determining if willfulness exists.Â  Valdak,\r\n  73 F.3d at 1469.Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nBurriss contends\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s decision contains various misapplications of the willful\r\n  standard and a misinterpretation of the evidence and testimony presented to the\r\n  Review Board member.Â Â   \r\nThe Review\r\n  Board member found sufficient evidence to sustain a willful violation of the\r\n  Act as follows:  \r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  preponderance of evidence shows that [Burriss] demonstrated plain indifference\r\n  to the Act in many ways . . . If not intentional disregard, [Burrissâ€™] clear\r\n  indifference to the Act is very apparent by the uncontested absence of\r\n  knowledge of safety and health standards applicable or potentially applicable\r\n  to a rapidly growing commercial electrical contracting business, lack of\r\n  possession of copies of the OSHA standards for general industry or\r\n  construction, lack of [Burriss]-provided training of employees and supervisors\r\n  for all potential hazards of the job, reliance on general\r\n  contractors to provide adequate safety training for oneâ€™s employees, lack of\r\n  attention to the warning represented by a previous citation related to a\r\n  specific trenching safety practice that would have helped eliminate other\r\n  violations, and lack of attention to the practices of other nearby contractors\r\n  at the same job site as to trenching safety.Â  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court likewise relied on similar evidence to uphold the finding of\r\n  willfulness.Â  The court stated the fact â€œ[Burriss] made no effort to acquaint\r\n  anyone, including itself, with the occupational safety and health regulations .\r\n  . . [and] did not even possess a copy of the occupational safety and health\r\n  standardsâ€ evidenced Burrissâ€™ plain indifference to general safety\r\n  considerations.  \r\nWe\r\n  find there is evidence of a willful violation from the complete absence of\r\n  knowledge by Burriss of the safety and health standards applicable to its\r\n  business at the time of the cave-in.Â  Burris does not dispute he was previously\r\n  cited for various violations of OSHA standards, one of which was similar to the\r\n  citation at issue herein.Â  As indicated, the circuit court found Burris made no\r\n  effort whatsoever to acquaint himself or anyone else with the applicable standards.\r\nAn\r\n  intentional disregard or plain indifference to the required standards suffices\r\n  to demonstrate a willful act.Â  One cannot be aware of the existence of\r\n  regulatory standards, have the means to review and learn them, consciously fail\r\n  to do so and then use lack of knowledge as an excuse.Â  To willfully turn oneâ€™s\r\n  head to knowledge and to understanding the requirements of the law after being\r\n  exposed to a similar citation in the past is tantamount to a conscious act, a\r\n  conscious disregard, which would meet the definition of a willful act.Â  Oneâ€™s\r\n  act of avoiding knowledge or completely disregarding it might also be labeled\r\n  as an intentional and voluntary act. Arguably, some form of indifference, in\r\n  and of itself, without more, may not rise to the level of a willful act.\r\n  However, we need not reach that question since the type of indifference herein\r\n  indeed rises to the level of a willful act or conscious disregard of the existence\r\n  of the standards and is much more than just a misunderstanding or a mere\r\n  negligent or careless act.Â  The policy of the law does not provide a shield to\r\n  one who is consciously aware of a regulatory scheme but intentionally\r\n  disregards or chooses to disavail himself of, or avoid, such knowledge or\r\n  requirements.Â  To do otherwise would defeat the intent and goals of the\r\n  regulatory scheme.\r\nBecause\r\n  we find this evidence alone sufficient to support a finding of willfulness, we\r\n  need not determine whether the circuit court erred in its application of the\r\n  willful standard or interpretation of the other evidence as suggested by\r\n  Burriss.Â  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s order is  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF\r\n  and PIEPER, JJ., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The text of Section 71, 1-1926.651(k)(1) does not\r\n  appear in the South Carolina Code of Regulations.Â  Instead, subarticle 7\r\n  indicates South Carolina law incorporates the federal Occupational Safety and Health\r\n  Act (OSHA) Regulation 29 C.F.R. Â§1926, with a few exceptions.Â  S.C. Code Regs.\r\n  ch.71, subart. 7 (1991).Â  This is the case with many other South Carolina\r\n  Occupational Safety and Health Regulations.Â  See e.g. S.C. Code\r\n  Regs. ch.71, subarts. 6 &amp; 8 (1991).Â   \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3] Burris is a family-owned business with Tommy Burriss\r\n  as project manager and his wife, Christine Burriss, as president. Â Â Â \r\n[4] In\r\n  addition to citing an employer for a violation, the Department can classify the\r\n  violation as: repeat, serious, or willful. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§41-15-320 (Supp.\r\n  2006).Â  Additional penalties are applied\r\n  if any of these heightened classifications are used.Â  Id.Â   \r\n[5] This court notes Act 387, effective July 1,\r\n  2006, has since modified S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§1-23-380 and certain appellate procedures.Â  However, we review Burrissâ€™ claim pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§1-23-380(A)(6) (2005) rather than S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§1-23-380(A)(5) (Supp. 2007) due to the fact the case arose under the\r\n  prior appellate procedure.Â  Regardless, as applied to this case, the only\r\n  difference between the two statutes is the numbering of the statutory\r\n  provisions.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-071","title":"Lee v.

Lee by one of Regalâ€™s employees.Â  We affirm.[1]  \r\nFACTS\r\nI.&nbsp; Background\r\nAt the time of the incident on March 28, 1996, Robert E. Lee (Lee)\r\n  was married to Jennifer Diane Lee (Jennifer) and had two small children.Â  Lee was\r\n  a carpenter who generally depended on government contracts for work. Â However,\r\n  approximately six months prior to March 28, Lee faced difficulty with his\r\n  primary employer and was no longer receiving work from the government.Â  Due to\r\n  the strain on the familyâ€™s budget resulting from Leeâ€™s inability to find work,\r\n  Jennifer decided to seek employment in the adult entertainment industry.Â  Subsequently,\r\n  Jennifer became employed by Diamonds Gentlemenâ€™s Club (Diamonds), located on Pittsburg Avenue in Charleston, South Carolina.[2]Â Â  \r\n\r\nII.&nbsp; The Incident\r\nDiamonds has standard procedures regarding exotic dancers and\r\n  requires each dancer disrobe by the â€œthird song of a three song set when the\r\n  exotic dancer is performing.â€Â  However, Jennifer refused to follow the\r\n  procedure and was suspended from her employment on March 27, 1996.Â  Despite her\r\n  suspension, Lee took Jennifer to work the next evening.Â  When Jennifer entered\r\n  the club, the assistant manager told her she had been fired and must leave the\r\n  premises.Â  Consequently, Jennifer â€œwaited for [Lee] to return to\r\n  their home in Summerville and called him and told him what happened and asked\r\n  him to come pick her up.â€Â  Upon hearing of Jenniferâ€™s dismissal, Lee called\r\n  Diamonds and asked to speak with Eddie Bell, the club manager.Â  Following a\r\n  heated discourse over the phone, Lee drove to Diamonds to pick up Jennifer.\r\nAfter\r\n  arriving at Diamonds, Lee told the assistant managers waiting at the entrance\r\n  he wished to speak to Bell.Â  In response, â€œ[Lee] was told on several occasions [Bell] would not speak with him, and further, it was inferred it would be unsafe for him to\r\n  talk to [Bell].â€Â  Nevertheless, Lee persisted in his attempt to speak with Bell for several minutes but finally turned and walked Jennifer back to their vehicle.Â \r\n  While Lee and Jennifer were returning to the vehicle, Bell â€œsuddenly emerged\r\n  from the club and viciously assaulted [Lee].â€ Â \r\nIII.&nbsp; Trial\r\n  Proceedings\r\nSubsequently, Lee brought an action against Regal and Bell, asserting Bell assaulted him in the course of Regalâ€™s business.Â  At trial,\r\n  Regal maintained Bell was acting outside the scope of his employment, and thus,\r\n  Regal was not liable for the assault.Â  Despite Regalâ€™s contention, the trial\r\n  court ruled in favor of Lee finding (1) Bell was an employee of Regal; (2) Bell committed an assault upon Lee; (3) Bell was performing the business of Regal at the\r\n  time of the assault; and (4) Leeâ€™s injuries â€œwere a direct and proximate result\r\n  of the assault of [Regalâ€™s] employee, [Bell].â€Â  The trial court further\r\n  concluded Regal was liable for Bellâ€™s assault under the doctrine of respondeat superior and awarded Lee the sum of $116,000 damages, both actual and\r\n  punitive, plus costs.[3] Â This appeal followed. \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen ruling on a directed verdict motion, the trial court is required\r\n  to view the evidence and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom in the light\r\n  most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Sabb v. S.C. State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).Â  This court must follow the same standard.Â  Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 299, 536 S.E.2d 408, 418 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Accordingly, this court will only reverse\r\n  the trial court when no evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  Steinke\r\n    v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing, &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 386, 520\r\n  S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Directed Verdict Upon\r\n  Release of Co-Defendant\r\nRegal\r\n  argues the trial court erred by failing to grant a directed verdict upon the\r\n  dismissal of Regalâ€™s co-defendant, Bell.Â  We disagree.\r\nRegal was sued under a respondeat superior theory by\r\n  which an employer is made liable for the acts of an employee acting within the\r\n  scope of his employment.Â  To maintain this action, it is not necessary to sue\r\n  both the employer and employee.Â  However, â€œwhen a principal and servant are\r\n  sued together, a principal is not responsible for punitive damages under respondeat superior when the agent was exonerated from liability.â€Â  Austin v. Specialty Transp. Servs., 358 S.C. 298, 319, 594 S.E.2d 867, 878\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004).Â  In the case sub judice, Bell was dismissed as a\r\n  party to the case, but was not exonerated from liability.[4]Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court\r\n  did not err in refusing to grant Regal a directed verdict upon Bellâ€™s dismissal from the case.\r\nII.&nbsp; Course and Scope of Bellâ€™s Employment\r\nRegal\r\n  also argues the trial court erred in failing to grant a directed verdict in\r\n  favor of Regal because Bell was not acting within the course and scope of his employment\r\n  at the time of the incident.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs\r\n  indicated, under the doctrine of respondeat superior, an employer\r\n  is liable for the acts of an employee acting within the scope of employment.Â  S.C. Ins. Co. v. James\r\n    C. Greene &amp; Co., 290 S.C. 171, 179, 348 S.E.2d 617, 621 (Ct. App.\r\n  1986).Â  In Jamison v. Howard, 271 S.C. 385, 388-91,\r\n  247 S.E.2d 450, 451-53 (1978), appeal after remand, 275 S.C. 344, 271\r\n  S.E.2d 116 (1980), a majority of the supreme court rejected the Restatement\r\n  approach in favor of the test applied in Jones v. Elbert, 211 S.C. 553,\r\n  34 S.E.2d 796 (1945).Â  Under the Jones test, finding the particular act\r\n  creating liability was within the servantâ€™s authority is unnecessary. Nor must the\r\n  act have been made for the purpose of performing the work the servant was\r\n  employed to do.Â  According to the Jones court, â€œ[i]f the servant is\r\n  doing some act in furtherance of the masterâ€™s business, he will be regarded as\r\n  acting within the scope of his employment, although he may exceed his\r\n  authority.â€Â  211 S.C. at 558, 34 S.E.2d at 798-99 (quoting Cantrell v. Claussenâ€™s\r\n    Bakery, 172 S.C. 490, 174 S.E. 438, 440 (1934).Â  However, â€œif the servant\r\n  acts for some independent purpose of his own, wholly disconnected with the\r\n  furtherance of his masterâ€™s business, his conduct falls outside the scope of\r\n  his employment.â€Â  Crittenden v. Thompson-Walker Co., 288 S.C. 112, 115-16, 341 S.E.2d\r\n  385, 387 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  Finally, â€œif there is\r\n  doubt as to whether the servant in injuring a third party was acting within the\r\n  scope of his employment, the doubt will be resolved against the master, at\r\n  least to the extent of requiring the question to be submitted to the jury for\r\n  determination.â€ Id.\r\nIn Armstrong\r\n  v. Food Lion, Inc., 371 S.C. 271, 639 S.E.2d 50 (2006), the court\r\n  reiterated these principles and found that the employees therein were not\r\n  acting within the scope of employment or in furtherance of the storeâ€™s business\r\n  when they attacked some customers.Â  The Supreme Court distinguished Crittenden\r\n  and Jones and noted that in those cases, the assaults occurred not only in\r\n  connection with the employerâ€™s business but also with the purpose in some way to\r\n  further the employerâ€™s business.Â  Id.\r\nSimilarly, in the present case, conflicting evidence in the record\r\n  supports the trial courtâ€™s finding Bell acted not only in connection with the\r\n  employerâ€™s business but also in furtherance thereof when he assaulted Lee.Â \r\n  According to the record, the assault occurred near Diamondsâ€™ premises during\r\n  normal working hours.Â  Moreover, Bell testified he came to the club\r\n  to prepare for a charity function and to consult with the assistant manager regarding\r\n  the dismissal of Jennifer.Â  Both of these activities were incidental to Bellâ€™s general duty as club manager to further the business of Diamonds.Â  Thus, Bell was working in connection with Regalâ€™s business and within\r\n  the scope of his employment at the time of the assault.Â  Furthermore, Bellâ€™s relationship to Lee arose solely from his position as Diamondsâ€™ manager.Â  Indeed, the\r\n  purpose of the assault was to convince Lee and his wife to leave Diamondsâ€™\r\n  premises. Â Furthermore, Bell testified, â€œit was the policy of Diamonds not to\r\n  call the police but rather handle disruptions on their own.â€Â  Consequently,\r\n  although Regal maintains the assault was outside the scope of Bellâ€™s authority,\r\n  the trial court was presented with conflicting inferences from which it may reasonably\r\n  conclude the assault was an act in furtherance of Regalâ€™s business.Â  Accordingly, since there is a factual\r\n    basis to support the courtâ€™s decision, we may not substitute our judgment for\r\n    that of the trial court and therefore affirm the courtâ€™s determination holding\r\n    Regal liable for Bellâ€™s assault on Lee.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Comparative Fault, Doctrine\r\n  of Mutual Combat, and Negligent Employment\r\nRegal\r\n  maintains the trial court erred by failing to apportion fault under the doctrine\r\n  of comparative fault, by failing to apply the doctrine of mutual combat to bar\r\n  Leeâ€™s claim, and by finding Regal liable under the theory of negligent\r\n  employment.Â  We find these issues are not preserved for our review.  \r\nIn\r\n  order for an issue to be preserved for appellate review, it must have been\r\n  raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.Â  See Lucas v. Rawl\r\n    Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505, 511, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004); see also In re Michael H., 360 S.C.\r\n  540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729, 732 (2004) (â€œAn issue may not be\r\n  raised for the first time on appeal.Â  In order to preserve an issue for appeal,\r\n  it must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.â€).Â  In\r\n  the present case, the record contains no indication the trial court ruled on the\r\n  issues of comparative fault,[5] mutual combat, or\r\n  negligent employment.Â  Moreover, Regal\r\n  did not file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion requesting a ruling on any of these\r\n  issues.[6]Â \r\n  Accordingly, Regalâ€™s claims regarding comparative fault, mutual combat, and\r\n  negligent employment are not preserved for our review.Â   \r\nIV.&nbsp; Punitive Damages\r\nRegal\r\n  also argues the trial court erred by awarding punitive damages in the amount of\r\n  $50,000.Â  We disagree.  \r\nPunitive damages, also known as exemplary damages, are imposed as\r\n  punishment.Â  Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 378-79, 529 S.E.2d 528, 533 (2000).Â  Punitive damages are allowed in the interest of society\r\n  in the nature of punishment and as a warning and example to deter the wrongdoer\r\n  and others from committing like offenses in the future.Â  Id.Â  Moreover, punitive damages serve to vindicate a private\r\n  right by requiring the wrongdoer to pay money to the injured party.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Accordingly, punitive damages serve at least three important purposes: (1)\r\n  punishment of the defendantâ€™s reckless, willful, wanton, or malicious conduct;\r\n  (2) deterrence of similar future conduct by the defendant or others; and (3) compensation for\r\n  the reckless or willful invasion of the plaintiffâ€™s private rights.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nâ€œOn the issue\r\n  of punitive damages, the highest burden of proof known to the civil law is\r\n  applicable.â€ Austin v. Specialty Transp. Servs., Inc., 358 S.C.\r\n  298, 313, 594 S.E.2d 867, 875 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Section 15-33-135 of the South Carolina Code (2005) provides: â€œIn any civil action where\r\n  punitive damages are claimed, the plaintiff has the burden of proving such\r\n  damages by clear and convincing evidence.â€Â  Thus, punitive damages can only be awarded where the plaintiff\r\n  proves by clear and convincing evidence the defendantâ€™s misconduct was willful,\r\n  wanton, or in reckless disregard of the plaintiffâ€™s rights.Â  Taylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 220, 479 S.E.2d 35, 45-46 (1996), appeal\r\n    after remand, 331 S.C. 575, 503 S.E.2d 458 (1998).\r\nWhile there is no formula or standard used as a measure for\r\n  assessing punitive damages, factors relevant to consideration of punitive\r\n  damages include: (1) the character of the\r\n  defendantâ€™s acts; (2) the nature and extent of the harm to plaintiff which\r\n  defendant caused or intended to cause; (3) defendantâ€™s degree of\r\n    culpability; (4) the punishment imposed; (5) duration of the conduct; (6) defendantâ€™s awareness or concealment; (7) the existence of similar past conduct; (8) likelihood the award will deter the defendant or others\r\n    from like conduct; (9)\r\n  whether the award is reasonably related to the harm likely to result from such\r\n  conduct; and (10) defendantâ€™s wealth or\r\n  ability to pay.Â  See Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, 111-12, 406\r\n  S.E.2d 350, 354 (1991); see also Welch v. Epstein, 342\r\n  S.C. 279, 306, 536 S.E.2d 408, 422 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œUnder Gamble, the trial court is not required\r\n  to make findings of fact for each factor to uphold a punitive damage award.â€).Â  While the trial court did not make\r\n    specific findings as to each factor and was not required to do so, we note that\r\n    no post-trial motion was ever made asking the court to address these matters.\r\n\r\n\tIn South Carolina, post-trial relief in the form of motions for judgment notwithstanding the\r\n  verdict, new trial, or new trial nisi are available to defendants\r\n  claiming a verdict excessive. See S.C.R.C.P. Rules 50 and 59. Moreover,\r\n  although there is no precise formula for measuring a punitive damage award, if\r\n  the trial judge â€œis convinced that the amount awarded is overliberal, he has\r\n  the authority and corresponding duty to reduce the verdict by order nisi.â€ \r\n\tHicks v. Herring, 246 S.C. 429, 436, 144 S.E.2d 151, 154 (1965).\r\n  (Emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\nGamble, 305 S.C. at 111, 406 S.E.2d at 354.Â  Here there is nothing in the\r\n  record demonstrating that the judge was given an opportunity to address these\r\n  matters pursuant to the filing of any post-trial motions.\r\nIn State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\r\n  Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 424-25 (2003), the United States Supreme Court, in discussing punitive damages, stated:\r\n\r\n\t[W]e have been\r\n  reluctant to identify concrete constitutional limits on the ratio between harm,\r\n  or potential harm, to the plaintiff and the punitive damages award. Â We decline\r\n  again to impose a bright-line ratio which a punitive damages award cannot\r\n  exceed. Â Our jurisprudence and the principles it has now established\r\n  demonstrate, however, that, in practice, few awards exceeding a single-digit\r\n  ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will\r\n  satisfy due process.\r\n\r\nCampbell further explained: â€œWhile these ratios\r\n  are not binding, they are instructive. They demonstrate what should be obvious:\r\n  Single-digit multipliers are more likely to comport with due process, while\r\n  still achieving the Stateâ€™s goals of deterrence and retribution . . . .â€Â  Id. at 425.\r\nUnder\r\n  our jurisprudence, the trial court is vested with considerable discretion in\r\n  assessing the amount of a punitive damage award.Â  Accordingly, the appellate\r\n  courtâ€™s review of the amount of punitive damages is limited to correction of\r\n  legal errors. See Austin, 358 S.C. at 314, 594 S.E.2d at 875. Â Thus, this\r\n  court must affirm the trial courtâ€™s punitive damages award if any evidence\r\n  reasonably supports the trial courtâ€™s factual findings.Â  Id.  \r\nApplying this analysis to the present case, we find no\r\n  due process error in the award of punitive damages awarded to Lee.Â  The trial court awarded Lee punitive damages approximately\r\n  0.75 times his actual damages.Â  While Regal contends the punitive damage\r\n  award was based on improper considerations by the trial court, Regal fails to\r\n  analyze the issue of actual damages as compared to punitive damages.Â  Although there is no mathematical test under the due\r\n  process analysis, we note the award does not exceed a\r\n  single-digit ratio between Leeâ€™s punitive and actual damages, consistent with Campbell.Â  Under Welch, Gamble, and Campbell , the punitive damage award to Lee was not excessive or grossly\r\n  disproportionate.Â  Accordingly, we find the punitive damage award to Lee\r\n  comports with due process; thus, the trial court did\r\n  not err in awarding Lee $50,000 in punitive damages.Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we hold there is sufficient evidence of record to support the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s conclusion that Regal was liable for the assault committed by Bell under the doctrine of respondeat superior.Â  We further hold the amount\r\n  of punitive damages awarded to Lee was not excessive or disproportionate.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHUFF\r\n  and PIEPER, JJ., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Regal is the owner and operator of Diamonds.\r\n[3] Specifically, the trial court concluded Lee suffered\r\n  damages as follows: (1) medical expenses: $16,000; (2) pain and suffering:\r\n  $50,000; and (3) punitive damages: $50,000.  \r\n[4] Indeed, Bell pled guilty to\r\n  simple assault prior to trial.Â   \r\n[5] While pled and argued, the final order does not\r\n  address the defense of comparative fault because negligence was not at issue.Â \r\n  Rather, the primary cause of action was the intentional tort of simple\r\n  assault.Â  Thus, the doctrine of comparative fault does not apply to an\r\n  intentional tort.Â   \r\n[6] As noted by our supreme court, â€œ[e]ven after an order is filed, counsel has an obligation\r\n  to review the order and file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend if\r\n  the order fails to set forth the findings and the reasons for those findings as\r\n  required by Section 17-27-80 of the South Carolina Code and Rule 52(a), SCRCP.â€Â  Pruitt v. State, 310 S.C. 254, 256, 423 S.E.2d 127, 128 (1992).Â  Although\r\n  Regal maintains a Rule 59(e) motion was filed, the record does not include any\r\n  evidence supporting this assertion.Â  See Helms Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 339, 611 S.E.2d\r\n  485, 487-88 (2005) (â€œThe appellant has the burden of\r\n  providing a sufficient record.â€).Â Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-072","title":"SCDSS v.

Clark, of Greenville, for the Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This\r\n  is a termination of parental rights (TPR) action.Â  The family court granted a\r\n  petition filed by the South Carolina Department of Social Services (SCDSS) to\r\n  terminate the parental rights of Calvin\r\n  J. (Father) to his minor child Calvin D. J. (Child).Â  Father appeals pursuant\r\n  to Ex Parte Cauthen, 291 S.C. 465, 354 S.E.2d 381 (1987).Â  We affirm.[2]Â   \r\nThe family court\r\n  terminated Fatherâ€™s parental rights to Child on the grounds that (1) Child has\r\n  lived outside Fatherâ€™s home for a period of at least six months and Father has\r\n  willfully failed to support Child or make a material contribution to Childâ€™s\r\n  care as required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(4) (Supp. 2006), (2) Child has\r\n  lived outside Fatherâ€™s home for at least six months and Father has willfully\r\n  failed to visit Child pursuant to id. Â§ 20-7-1572(3), (3) Father has\r\n  failed to remedy the conditions which caused the removal of Child as required\r\n  by id. Â§ 20-7-1572(2), and (4) Child has been in foster care for fifteen\r\n  of the most recent twenty-two months as provided in id. Â§ 20-7-1572(8).Â \r\n  The family court further found it was in Childâ€™s best interest that TPR be\r\n  granted.\r\nChild\r\n  lived with Father from the time of his birth in 1999 until Father was\r\n  incarcerated in 2004.Â  Father was released, but was thereafter reincarcerated\r\n  on several occasions, causing Child to be taken into foster care.Â  Father also\r\n  had an ongoing substance abuse problem.Â  At the time this case was decided,\r\n  Child had been in foster care for two and a half years and had a family who\r\n  wished to adopt him.Â  Based on all reports, Child was thriving in his new\r\n  environment.Â  Father opposes this action to terminate his parental rights,\r\n  however, arguing he has made efforts to support and visit Child, and he has\r\n  formed a bond with Child.\r\nWe have carefully reviewed this record and we are not\r\n  unsympathetic to Father, especially in light of evidence that he formed a bond\r\n  with Child.Â  We do recognize the policy in the South Carolina Code of Laws for\r\n  reunification as stated in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-20(D) (1985),[3] but we also know the countervailing\r\n  best interest of the minor child must always remain paramount.Â  See Depâ€™t\r\n    of Soc. Servs. v. Phillips, 365 S.C.\r\n  572, 576, 618 S.E.2d 922, 923-24&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005) (stating in TPR cases,\r\n  the best interest of the child is the paramount and controlling consideration).\r\nAfter weighing these competing, yet vital, considerations, we are\r\n  firmly persuaded the family court judge made the correct decision to terminate\r\n  Fatherâ€™s parental rights in this unfortunate and difficult case.Â  We concur\r\n  with the family court judgeâ€™s decision based on Fatherâ€™s recidivist tendencies,\r\n  apparently stemming from his inability to deal with his drug addiction. During\r\n  the varying times between his multiple incarcerations, Father demonstrated some\r\n  effort to act as a parent.Â  Conversely, there were times when Father did not\r\n  act as a parent.Â  In fact, there were months where he did not pay any support\r\n  or visit his son.Â  Thus, we conclude termination of Fatherâ€™s parental rights is\r\n  in Childâ€™s best interest so that Child will have a stable home environment.Â  Cf. Phillips, 365 S.C. at 579-80, 582, 618 S.E.2d at 925, 927 (recognizing\r\n  that, while Phillips showed some progress in her treatment plan, she fell short\r\n  of actually remedying the conditions that caused the childâ€™s removal, namely\r\n  ending her drug use, continuing counseling, and finding employment, and thus\r\n  concluding that termination of Phillipsâ€™s parental rights was in the best\r\n  interests of the children).\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the family court is,\r\n  therefore,\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The record in this matter is sealed.\r\n[2]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.Â   \r\n[3]Â  Section 20-7-20(D) provides in relevant part:Â  â€œIt\r\n  is the policy of this State to reunite the child with his family in a timely\r\n  manner, whether or not the child has been placed in the care of the State\r\n  voluntarily.â€Â  Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
