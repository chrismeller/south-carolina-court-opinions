Eagle Motor Lines, 373 S.C. 422, 436,\r\n  645 S.E.2d 424, 431 (2007).Â  &quot;Substantial evidence is that evidence which,\r\n  in considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the\r\n  conclusion the Commission reached.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;A claimant may seek\r\n  to reopen an award under the Workers' Compensation Act if there has been a\r\n  change in condition.&quot;Â  Robbins v. Walgreens and Broadspire Serv., Inc.,\r\n  375 S.C. 259, 265, 652 S.E.2d 90, 93 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  &quot;A change in\r\n  condition occurs when the claimant experiences a change in physical condition\r\n  as a result of her original injury, occurring after the first award.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn the case at bar,\r\n  the single commissioner properly found Ward suffered from a compensable change\r\n  in condition resulting from his original work injury.Â  Substantial evidence in\r\n  the record supports the single commissioner's conclusion.Â  The Carrier\r\n  specifically asked Dr. Johnson in his first deposition if he could offer any\r\n  opinion as to the cause of Wardâ€™s deteriorating back condition, and Johnson\r\n  stated if the results of the 2005 MRI showed a worsening of the disc problem in\r\n  L3-4, then it would be a continuation of Wardâ€™s work injury shown in the 2001\r\n  MRI.Â  The results of the 2005 MRI after the first deposition confirmed Ward\r\n  suffered a worsening of the disc problem in L3-4.Â  Johnsonâ€™s testimony in the\r\n  first deposition, combined with the results of the 2005 MRI in the record,\r\n  strongly supports the inference that Ward's worsening back condition was\r\n  causally connected to his original work injury.Â  Accordingly, the single\r\n  commissioner correctly concluded Ward suffered from a compensable change in\r\n  condition, and the Appellate Panel and circuit court correctly affirmed the\r\n  single commissionerâ€™s order.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT,\r\n  THOMAS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-077","title":"State v.

Hudgins, South Carolina Commission\r\n          on Indigent Defense, Division of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney\r\n          General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant\r\n          Attorney General Julie M. Thames, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Donald V.\r\n          Myers, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: James\r\n  O. Senn appeals his conviction for trafficking 400 or more grams of\r\n  methamphetamine, alleging the trial court erred in denying his motion for a\r\n  directed verdict and denying his request to charge lesser-included offenses.Â  \r\n1. As to the directed\r\n  verdict motion, Agent Nathan McCoy testified the methamphetamine-containing\r\n  solution found in just one of the two containers in Sennâ€™s possession weighed\r\n  well over 400 grams.Â  Accordingly, the trial court properly denied Sennâ€™s\r\n  directed verdict motion.Â  State v.\r\n    Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292-93, 625\r\n  S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006) (â€œWhen ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the\r\n  trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not\r\n  its weight. Â A defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the state fails\r\n  to produce evidence of the offense charged.â€).\r\n2. As to charging\r\n  lesser-included offenses, we initially note Senn never requested a â€œsimple\r\n  possessionâ€ charge at trial.Â  Furthermore, with regard to the lesser-included\r\n  offense of trafficking less than 400 grams, we find no evidence in the record\r\n  supporting such a charge.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(C)(5) (Supp. 2008)\r\n  (establishing the crime of trafficking 400 or more grams of methamphetamine,\r\n  and referencing Â§ 44-53-210(d) to supply the definition of methamphetamine);\r\n  S.C. Code Ann Â§ 44-53-210(d) (2002) (defining methamphetamine to include any\r\n  material, compound, mixture, or preparation which contains any quantity of\r\n  methamphetamine, its salts, and salts of isomers);Â  see also State v.\r\n    Knoten, 347 S.C. 296, 302, 555 S.E.2d 391, 394 (2001) (internal citation\r\n  omitted) (â€œThe law to be charged\r\n  must be determined from the evidence presented at trial.â€); State v.

App. 2006) (â€œThe mere contention\r\n  that the jury might accept the Stateâ€™s evidence in part and reject it in part\r\n  is insufficient to satisfy the requirement that some evidence tend to show the\r\n  defendant was guilty only of the lesser offense.â€). \r\nAFFIRMED.[1] \r\nWILLIAMS,\r\nPIEPER, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\nRule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-085","title":"State v.

Wellborn, of Rock Hill, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  On September 12, 2006, a Clover police officer entered the Friendly Mart to\r\n  investigate a report of illegal video poker machines at the establishment.Â  He\r\n  noticed video screens in an open storage room simultaneously go dark as he\r\n  entered the store.Â  After viewing the dark machines, he asked That Tran, the\r\n  store owner, to turn them back on.Â  Tran complied without objection, and the\r\n  machines displayed a video game known to the officer to be illegal.Â  The police\r\n  department then seized all three video machines, and Tran was indicted for operating a gaming house and\r\n  possession of gambling devices.Â  Tran made a pretrial motion to suppress\r\n  evidence of the poker machines.Â  The circuit court granted Tranâ€™s motion.Â  The State appealed.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State argues the circuit court erred in suppressing the video poker machines\r\n  because their discovery falls within the plain view exception to the Fourth\r\n  Amendment prohibition against warrantless searches.Â  We agree.\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State\r\n    v. Butler, 353 S.C. 383, 388, 577 S.E.2d 498, 500&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).Â \r\n  Our review in Fourth Amendment search and seizure cases is limited to\r\n  determining whether any evidence supports the circuit courtâ€™s finding.Â  State\r\n    v. Bowman, 366 S.C. 485, 501, 623 S.E.2d 378, 386&nbsp;(2005).Â  The Fourth\r\n  Amendmentâ€™s exclusionary rule prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.&nbsp;\r\n  U.S. Const. amend. IV; see also S.C. Const. art. I, Â§&nbsp;10.&nbsp; Evidence\r\n  seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment is inadmissible.&nbsp; State v.\r\n    Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 643, 541 S.E.2d 837, 840 (2001).&nbsp; â€œGenerally,\r\n  a warrantless search is per se unreasonable and thus violative of the Fourth\r\n  Amendmentâ€™s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures.â€&nbsp; State\r\n    v. Bultron, 318 S.C. 323, 331, 457 S.E.2d 616, 621 (Ct. App. 1995).&nbsp; However,\r\n  a warrantless search may be constitutional if it falls within a recognized\r\n  exception.Â  Id. at 331-32, 457 S.E.2d at 621.&nbsp; Under the plain view\r\n  exception, â€œa law enforcement officer who is lawfully in a position to view\r\n  [an] objectâ€ may seize it.Â  State v. Abdullah, 357 S.C. 344, 352, 592\r\n  S.E.2d 344, 349 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The plain view doctrine applies when â€œâ€˜(1)\r\n  the initial intrusion which afforded the authorities the plain view was lawful;\r\n  (2) the discovery of the evidence was inadvertent; and (3) the incriminating\r\n  [nature of the] evidence was immediately apparent to the seizing\r\n  authorities.â€™â€Â  Id. at 352-53, 592 S.E.2d at 349 (quoting State v.\r\n    Culbreath, 300 S.C. 232, 237, 387 S.E.2d 255, 257 (1990)).Â  The United\r\n  States Supreme Court has eliminated the requirement that the discovery be\r\n  inadvertent, as long as the seizure meets the other two requirements.Â  Horton\r\n    v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 130 (1990).\r\nThe\r\n  seizure in this case clearly fell within the plain view exception.Â  The\r\n  officerâ€™s entry into the Friendly Mart, a place of business, and into the open\r\n  storage room was lawful.Â  The officer encountered no signage or barrier\r\n  indicating the storage room was off-limits to customers, and store personnel\r\n  did not attempt to stop him entering the room.Â  The circuit court erred in\r\n  finding the seizure failed the remaining prong of the plain view test, that the\r\n  incriminating nature of the machines be immediately apparent.Â  The evidence did\r\n  not indicate the police conducted an additional search of the video poker\r\n  machines or otherwise forced them to reveal their programming.Â  Rather, Tran\r\n  maintained full control of them until their seizure.Â  At the request of a man\r\n  who had not identified himself as a police officer, Tran consensually turned on\r\n  the machines and displayed their incriminating nature.Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  the officer observed the machines while lawfully present in the Friendly Mart\r\n  and seized them only after the storeâ€™s owner willingly displayed their\r\n  programming contents, their seizure falls into the plain view exception to the\r\n  exclusionary rule.Â  Consequently, the circuit court erred in suppressing the\r\n  seized machines.Â  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., SHORT and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-087","title":"Williams v.

Anderson, Jr., of Florence, Â Pro Se,\r\n  for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this case, the State asserts the dismissal of a traffic\r\n  ticket by the magistrate court at a pretrial hearing was in error.Â  The circuit\r\n  court affirmed the decision of the magistrate and this appeal followed.Â  We\r\n  affirm as modified.[1]\r\n1.&nbsp; The gravamen of the State's argument on appeal is that based\r\n  upon the Francis Marion University (FMU) campus police officer's status as a\r\n  State Constable, the officer possessed statewide authority to issue citations\r\n  at any location in the state.Â  However, other than a bald assertion of\r\n  statewide authority, the campus officer's constable status was never\r\n  established before the magistrate although the officer was given an opportunity\r\n  to do so.Â  We question whether the issue was properly preserved by the\r\n  officer's unsupported assertion before the magistrate; however, even if we were\r\n  to consider the officer's constable commission submitted by the State for the\r\n  first time on appeal, that commission nonetheless is dated after the date of\r\n  the offense herein.Â  Accordingly, the officer's statewide authority was never\r\n  established.\r\n2.&nbsp; The State also contends on appeal that the circuit court\r\n  improperly applied Sections 59-116-10 et. seq. of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (2007) due to the officer's alleged status as a State Constable\r\n  at the time he issued the ticket and due to FMU's classification as a public\r\n  institution.[2]Â \r\n  However, the campus officer's status as a State Constable is dispositive under\r\n  either Â§ 23-1-60 (State Constable provision) or under Â§ 59-116-10 et. seq. (noting Â§ 59-116-20\r\n  specifically requires the campus police officer to be commissioned as a\r\n  constable pursuant to Â§ 23-1-60 (State Constable provision)).Â  Since the\r\n  officer's status as a State Constable was never established in this record, the\r\n  circuit court's statutory interpretation of Â§ 59-116-10 et. seq. was\r\n  unnecessary.

Haselden, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  The Appellate Panel of the South Carolina Workers'\r\n    Compensation Commission (Appellate Panel) awarded benefits to Lishawn Moore.Â \r\n    The circuit court reversed this award, and Moore appeals.Â  We reverse.Â Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMoore\r\n  was employed by the South Carolina Department of Corrections (Department) as a\r\n  corrections officer at Allendale Correctional Institution (ACI).Â  From June 1\r\n  to June 3, 2004, Moore worked twelve-hour shifts, from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.Â \r\n  Because she worked three days and was off two days, Moore was not scheduled to\r\n  work June 4.Â  At the end of her shift on June 3, 2004, Moore left ACI and drove\r\n  to her home in Denmark, thirty minutes away.Â  Upon arriving at home at about\r\n  7:45 a.m., Moore received a telephone call from Officer Holman at ACI, asking\r\n  if Moore had taken home a pair of handcuffs from ACI's Bamberg B-Wing.Â  Moore\r\n  located the handcuffs in her jacket pocket.Â  Although Moore testified she\r\n  believed she needed to return the handcuffs to ACI immediately, Officer Holman\r\n  testified she told Moore she could do so the next time she came into work.[1]Â Â Â  \r\nWith\r\n  her young son in the car, Moore drove back to ACI and returned the handcuffs.Â \r\n  The officer at the front gate, who was expecting Moore, accepted the handcuffs\r\n  and returned them to Bamberg B-Wing.Â  After leaving ACI, Moore stopped at a\r\n  convenience store and purchased a drink for her son.Â  She testified the next\r\n  thing she remembered was waking up with her car off the highway, down an\r\n  embankment, and crashed into a tree.Â  The injuries Moore sustained in the wreck\r\n  left her paraplegic.Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  first single commissioner who reviewed Moore's claim for workers' compensation\r\n  benefits held Moore's injuries were compensable.Â  The Department appealed, and\r\n  the Appellate Panel remanded for a new hearing.Â  The second single commissioner\r\n  also found Moore's injuries compensable, and the Appellate Panel affirmed.Â  The\r\n  Department appealed to the circuit court, which reversed, holding Moore's claim\r\n  was not compensable.Â  Moore appealed to this court.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  reviewing workers' compensation decisions, the appellate court ascertains &quot;whether\r\n  the circuit court properly determined whether the [A]ppellate [P]anel's\r\n  findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence in the record and\r\n  whether the [Appellate P]anel's decision is affected by an error of law.&quot;Â  Baxter v. Martin Bros., Inc., 368 S.C. 510, 513, 630 S.E.2d 42,\r\n  43&nbsp;(2006) (citations omitted); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  1-23-380(5) (Supp. 2008).Â  &quot;'Substantial evidence' is evidence which,\r\n  considering the entire record, would allow reasonable minds to arrive at the\r\n  same conclusion reached by the administrative agency.&quot;Â  S.C.

App. 2003).Â  The Administrative Procedures Act does not permit an\r\n  appellate court to &quot;substitute its judgment for that of the [Appellate\r\n  Panel] as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.&quot;Â  West v.\r\n    Alliance Capital, 368 S.C. 246, 251, 628 S.E.2d 279, 282 (Ct. App. 2006); see also Â§ 1-23-380(5).Â  Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMoore argues the circuit\r\n  court erred in reversing the Appellate Panel's award of benefits because the\r\n  award was supported by substantial evidence in the record and was not affected\r\n  by an error of law.Â  We\r\n  agree.\r\nIn reviewing the Appellate Panel's decision, the circuit court's\r\n  role is limited to determining whether substantial evidence in the record\r\n  supports the Appellate Panel's findings of fact and whether the decision is\r\n  affected by an error of law. Â Baxter\r\n    v. Martin Bros., Inc., 368 S.C. 510, 513, 630 S.E.2d 42, 43&nbsp;(2006)\r\n  (citations omitted); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5) (Supp. 2008).\r\n  Â \r\nIn\r\n  reversing the Appellate Panel's decision in favor of its own interpretation of\r\n  the evidence, the circuit court improperly extended the substantial-evidence\r\n  standard of review.Â  Sitting in an appellate capacity, the circuit court was\r\n  tasked with reviewing the Appellate Panel's decision to determine whether\r\n  substantial evidence supported the Appellate Panel's findings.Â  See Baxter, 368\r\n  S.C. at 513, 630 S.E.2d at 43; Â§&nbsp;1-23-380(5).Â  Here, the circuit court made its own determinations of\r\n  credibility, holding substantial evidence indicated Moore's trip was not done\r\n  to advance the Department's interest and conferred no actual benefit on the\r\n  Department.Â  At the same time, the circuit court failed to determine whether\r\n  the Appellate Panel's findings were supported by substantial evidence.Â  Rather,\r\n  the circuit court conducted its own evaluation of the merits of the case and\r\n  improperly substituted its judgment for that of the Appellate Panel as to the\r\n  weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  See West, 368 S.C. at 251, 628 S.E.2d at 282.Â  This expansion of\r\n  the scope of review was error.Â Â Â  \r\nInasmuch\r\n  as we have reversed the circuit court's decision because it impermissibly\r\n  expanded the scope of its review, we need not reach whether application of the\r\n  special errand doctrine amounted to an error of law.Â  See Futch v.\r\n    McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591,\r\n  598 (1999) (ruling an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a\r\n  prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  find the circuit court impermissibly substituted its own judgment for that of\r\n  the Appellate Panel in violation of the substantial evidence scope of review.Â \r\n  Therefore, the order of the circuit court is \r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nSHORT\r\n  and KONDUROS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Although testimony indicated Department policy\r\n  required weapons to be returned immediately, the witnesses were aware of no\r\n  such policy specifically pertaining to handcuffs and no other incidents\r\n  involving handcuffs inadvertently removed from ACI.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-092","title":"Logan v.

Andrew Gowder, Jr., Daniel S. McQueeney, both of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This\r\n  appeal arises after Henri Ann Logan, a real estate attorney, discovered\r\n  Wachovia made three banking errors concerning her attorney trust account.Â \r\n  Wachovia made the banking errors in 1999, and Logan filed suit against Wachovia\r\n  on August 13, 2004.Â  The trial court granted Wachovia summary judgment because\r\n  Logan failed to comply with the three-year statute of limitations.Â  Logan\r\n  appeals this ruling and argues the trial court erred by 1) granting Wachovia's\r\n  summary judgment motion because her lawsuit concerns Wachovia's actions after\r\n  she discovered their mistakes; 2) granting Wachovia summary judgment on her\r\n  defamation cause of action; 3) denying her motion for summary judgment; 4)Â \r\n  failing to find Wachovia should be estopped from asserting certain defenses\r\n  including the statute of limitations defense; 5) finding a purported 1997\r\n  agreement was the contract between the parties; 6) failing to find unjust\r\n  enrichment applied to her case; and 7)Â  prematurely granting summary judgment.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\n1.Â  The trial court did not\r\n  err in granting Wachovia's summary judgment motion based on the statute of\r\n  limitations.Â  In South Carolina a party must commence an action within three\r\n  years of the date the cause of action arises.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530\r\n  (2005).Â  The three-year statute of limitations &quot;begins to run when the underlying\r\n  cause of action reasonably ought to have been discovered.&quot;Â  Martin v.\r\n    Companion Healthcare Corp., 357 S.C. 570, 575, 593 S.E.2d 624, 627 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2004).Â  Under the discovery rule, &quot;the three-year clock starts\r\n  ticking on the date the injured party either knows or should have known by the\r\n  exercise of reasonable diligence that a cause of action arises from the\r\n  wrongful conduct.&quot;Â  Id. at 575-76, 593 S.E.2d at 627 (internal\r\n  citation omitted).Â Â  Further, pursuant to the terms and conditions of Logan's deposit\r\n  account, she agreed to report unauthorized transactions or errors to Wachovia\r\n  within sixty days of receiving her banking statement.Â  As a general rule, in South Carolina, parties may exercise freedom of contract, so long as the contract is\r\n  lawful.Â  Jordan v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 264 S.C. 294, 297,\r\n  214 S.E.2d 818, 820 (1975) (&quot;While parties are generally permitted to\r\n  contract as they desire, freedom to contract is not absolute and coverage\r\n  required by law may not be omitted.&quot;). \r\n2.Â  The trial court did not\r\n  err in granting Wachovia's summary judgment motion on Logan's defamation\r\n  claim.Â  &quot;In order to prove defamation, a party must show: (1) a false and\r\n  defamatory statement was made; (2) the unprivileged publication of the\r\n  statement to a third party; (3) the publisher was at fault; and (4) either the\r\n  statement was actionable irrespective of harm or the publication of the\r\n  statement caused special harm.&quot;Â  Williams v. Lancaster County Sch. Dist., 369 S.C. 293, 302-03, 631 S.E.2d 286, 292 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Hearsay is a\r\n  &quot;statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the\r\n  trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of matter asserted.&quot;Â \r\n  Rule 801(c), SCRE.Â  Generally, hearsay is inadmissible.Â  Rule 802, SCRE.Â  Under\r\n  the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, an affidavit supporting summary\r\n  judgment must be made on personal knowledge, must be admissible, and must show\r\n  the affiant's competency to testify.Â  Rule 56(e), SCRCP (&quot;Supporting and\r\n  opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such\r\n  facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the\r\n  affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.&quot;).Â  \r\n3.Â  The trial court did not\r\n  err in denying Logan's summary judgment motion because this issue is not\r\n  immediately appealable.Â  See Ballenger v. Bowen, 313 S.C. 476,\r\n  476, 443 S.E.2d 379, 380 (1994) (holding &quot;the denial of summary judgment\r\n  is not directly appealable.&quot;).Â  Moreover, even in an appeal from a final\r\n  judgment, a denial of summary judgment is not reviewable.Â  Id. at 477,\r\n  443 S.E.2d at 380.Â  Accordingly, we need not address the denial of summary\r\n  judgment issue.\r\n4.Â  The trial court did not\r\n  err in finding Wachovia was not estopped from asserting defenses or in finding\r\n  a 1997 contract was the controlling agreement between the parties.Â  The purpose\r\n  of Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion is to request for the trial judge to reconsider\r\n  matters properly encompassed in a decision on the merits.Â  Collins Music\r\n    Co., Inc. v. IGT, 353 S.C. 559, 562, 579 S.E.2d 524, 525 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  In Pye v. Estate of Fox, the South Carolina Supreme Court identified two\r\n  ways to preserve an issue for appeal as either: &quot;a ruling by the trial\r\n  [court] or a post-trial motion.&quot;Â  369 S.C. 555, 566, 633 S.E.2d 505, 511\r\n  (2006).Â  During the hearing on the summary judgment motion, Logan argued\r\n  Wachovia &quot;should be estopped from even raising the [statute of\r\n  limitations] argument.&quot;Â  However, the trial court did not rule on the\r\n  estoppel argument or rule on whether the 1997 contract governed relations\r\n  between the parties at the end of the hearing or in its order granting summary\r\n  judgment. Â Logan should have filed a Rule 59(e) motion, alerting the trial\r\n  court to both issues and giving the court an opportunity these issues.Â  See Pye, 369 S.C. at 565, 633 S.E.2d at 510.Â  Instead, Logan directly\r\n  appealed the trial court's order granting Wachovia's summary judgment motion.Â \r\n  Because this issue was never raised at the trial level, it is not preserved for\r\n  our review.Â  In re Michael H., 360 S.C. 540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729, 732\r\n  (2004) (&quot;An issue may not be raised for the first time on appeal.Â  In\r\n  order to preserve an issue for appeal, it must be raised to and ruled upon by\r\n  the trial court.&quot;).Â  \r\n5.Â  Logan's unjust enrichment\r\n  argument is abandoned.Â  An issue is deemed abandoned and will not be considered\r\n  on appeal if the argument is raised in a brief but not supported by authority.Â  State v. Jones, 344 S.C. 48, 58-59, 543 S.E.2d 541, 546 (2001).Â  Logan failed to cite any authority in support of her unjust enrichment assertion;\r\n  therefore, she abandoned this issue on appeal.\r\n6.Â  The trial court did not\r\n  prematurely grant Wachovia's motion for summary judgment.Â  Until the opposing\r\n  party has had a full and fair opportunity to investigate, summary judgment is a\r\n  drastic remedy and must not be granted.Â  Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58,\r\n  69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 439 (2003).Â  &quot;Nonetheless, the nonmoving party must\r\n  demonstrate the likelihood that further discovery will uncover additional\r\n  relevant evidence and that the party is not merely engaged in a fishing\r\n  expedition.&quot;Â  Id.

Fowler\r\n  (Respondent) claimed across Appellantâ€™s land.Â  When Respondent cut limbs from\r\n  those trees, Appellant filed an action for trespass and property damage.Â  She\r\n  now appeals from the master-in-equityâ€™s order finding Respondent had an\r\n  easement across Appellantâ€™s land.Â  We reverse.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nI.&nbsp; Land Conveyances\r\nOn\r\n  September 29, 1981, Respondent acquired 3.72 acres of land through a civil suit\r\n  for partition of his fatherâ€™s estate.Â  The estateâ€™s real property was surveyed\r\n  and platted on November 9, 1981.Â  No easement appeared either in Respondentâ€™s\r\n  title or on that plat.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  June 17, 1999, Respondentâ€™s land was surveyed and platted in preparation for\r\n  conveyances Respondent intended to make to his children.Â  The plat prepared at\r\n  this time (the Inman Plat) reflects an â€œexisting soil driveâ€ within a\r\n  twenty-five-foot private easement across the north side of the parcel.Â  On\r\n  August 6, 1999, Respondent and his wife conveyed the easternmost 0.99 acres of\r\n  their land to their son and Appellant, their daughter-in-law.Â  Respondent and\r\n  his wife reserved a life estate in the conveyed land.Â  On June 28, 2000, they\r\n  released this right and conveyed their remaining interest in the land to their\r\n  son and Appellant.Â  Although the title references the Inman Plat, neither the\r\n  title nor the release document indicates an easement. Â Â \r\nRespondentâ€™s\r\n  son and Appellant divorced in January 2005.Â  On April 20, 2005, Appellant\r\n  received title to the 0.99 acres solely in her name pursuant to the divorce\r\n  decree.Â  The title document executed by Respondentâ€™s son references the Inman\r\n  Plat but does not indicate an easement.Â  Â Â \r\nOn\r\n  April 18, 2006, the land was surveyed again at Respondentâ€™s request.Â  The plat\r\n  prepared following this survey reflects a â€œprivate access easementâ€ identified\r\n  as â€œDolly Laneâ€ across the north side of Appellantâ€™s land and references the\r\n  prior plat.Â  Furthermore, this plat appears to indicate a proposed driveway and\r\n  cul-de-sac extending from Dolly Lane across half of Respondentâ€™s property.Â \r\n  Both the 1981 and 2006 plats show a county road either touching or defining a\r\n  portion of the western boundary of Respondentâ€™s property.[2]Â \r\n  Â Â \r\nII.&nbsp; Background and\r\n  Procedural History\r\nIn\r\n  August 2000, Appellant planted eight Bradford pear trees approximately six feet\r\n  from the existing soil drive shown on the Inman Plat.Â  On April 5, 2005,\r\n  Respondent and his grandson destroyed one of those trees.Â  Appellant filed\r\n  criminal charges against them but later withdrew those charges in an effort to\r\n  â€œmake peace with the family.â€Â  On February 8, 2007, Respondent and his grandson\r\n  used a chainsaw to cut branches from the remaining Bradford pear trees, leaving\r\n  marks across the trunks of several of those trees.Â  Subsequently, Appellant\r\n  posted â€œno trespassingâ€ signs on and near the trees.Â  When Respondent removed\r\n  them, Appellant again filed criminal charges against him and a civil suit for\r\n  trespass and malicious damage to her property.Â  \r\nAppellantâ€™s\r\n  civil suit was referred to the master, who ruled in favor of Respondent and\r\n  found Respondent had â€œby dedication a private easement . . . for travel\r\n  purposes of ingress and egressâ€ across Appellantâ€™s land.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Easement by\r\n  Dedication\r\nAppellant\r\n  asserts the master erred in finding Respondent possessed an easement by\r\n  dedication across her land.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œThe determination\r\n  of the existence of an easement is a question of fact in a\r\n  law action and subject to an any evidence standard of review when tried by a\r\n  judge without a jury.â€Â  Hardy v. Aiken,&nbsp;369 S.C. 160, 165, 631\r\n  S.E.2d 539, 541&nbsp;(2006).Â  \r\nThe master\r\n  erred in concluding Respondent possessed an easement by dedication.Â  South Carolina law presumes a buyer of a lot in subdivided property has a dedicated property\r\n  right in any easements or roads shown on the plat.Â  Inlet Harbour v. S.C.\r\n    Depâ€™t of Parks, Recreation &amp; Tourism, 377 S.C. 86, 92, 659 S.E.2d 151,\r\n  154 (2008); see also Murrells Inlet Corp. v. Ward, 378 S.C. 225,\r\n  233, 662 S.E.2d 452, 455-56 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  While an easement by dedication\r\n  may be described in a plat prepared prior to conveyance of subdivided property,\r\n  no easement legally exists until the seller conveys ownership of a part of that\r\n  property to a buyer.Â  Inlet Harbour, 377 S.C. at 92, 659 S.E.2d at\r\n  154.Â  To create this implied easement, the deed must reference the plat.Â  Id.Â  Once created, the easement benefits the buyer.Â  Id.; see also Murrells\r\n    Inlet Corp., 378 S.C. at 233, 662 S.E.2d at 455-56; McAllister v. Smiley,\r\n  301 S.C. 10, 12, 389 S.E.2d 857, 859 (1990).[3]Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  Respondent prepared a plat describing the way he intended to subdivide his\r\n  property into three lots, two of which were to go to his children.Â  He ultimately\r\n  conveyed ownership of only one lot and now claims an easement by dedication\r\n  across it.Â  However, because an easement by dedication benefits the buyer, this\r\n  presumption is unavailable to Respondent, the seller.Â  Consequently, Respondent\r\n  does not possess an easement by dedication across Appellantâ€™s land.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Other\r\n  Issues\r\nAppellant\r\n  additionally asserts the master erred in violating her due process rights and\r\n  in failing to rule on her motions for summary judgment.Â  Due to our disposition\r\n  of Appellantâ€™s first issue, we need not address the remaining issues on appeal. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598,\r\n  613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a\r\n  prior issue is dispositive of the appeal). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAs\r\n  to the issue of Respondentâ€™s easement, we find Respondent does not have an\r\n  easement by dedication across Appellantâ€™s land.Â  Therefore, we reverse the masterâ€™s\r\n  order on this issue.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the masterâ€™s order is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., KONDUROS, J., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The western end of Respondentâ€™s property does not\r\n  appear on the Inman Plat.Â  \r\n[3] Our supreme court explored the policies underlying implied\r\n  public and private easements by dedication in Cason v. Gibson, 217 S.C.\r\n  500, 61 S.E.2d 58 (1950).Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-097","title":"State v.

Elliott, Assistant\r\n  Attorney General Lance Boozer, all of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In\r\n  this post-conviction relief (PCR) case, we granted certiorari to review the PCR\r\n  judge's grant of relief for Roy Edward Hook.Â  We reverse. [1] \r\nHook\r\n  applied for PCR after his five-year probationary sentence was revoked in full.Â \r\n  After a hearing, the PCR judge granted relief, finding Hook's counsel was\r\n  ineffective for (1) failing to call witnesses on Hook's behalf and (2) failing\r\n  to object when a probation agent informed the revocation judge of Hook's\r\n  pending criminal charges.Â  We find neither ground supports a finding of\r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  \r\n1.Â \r\n  At the PCR hearing, Hook did not proffer the testimony of the witnesses he\r\n  argues counsel should have called during the probation revocation hearing.Â \r\n  Accordingly, he had failed to show how he was prejudiced by any deficient\r\n  performance of his revocation counsel.Â  See Porter v. State, 368 S.C.\r\n  378, 386, 629 S.E.2d 353, 358 (2006) (&quot;Mere speculation of what a witness'[s]\r\n  testimony may be is insufficient to satisfy the burden of showing prejudice in\r\n  a petition for PCR.&quot;); Dempsey v. State, 363 S.C. 365, 369, 610\r\n  S.E.2d 812, 814&nbsp;(2005) (holding a PCR applicant cannot show that he was\r\n  prejudiced by counsel's failure to call a favorable witness to testify at trial\r\n  if that witness does not later testify at the PCR hearing or otherwise offer\r\n  testimony within the rules of evidence); Strickland v. Washington, 466\r\n  U.S. 668, 687 (1984) (explaining in order to establish a claim of ineffective\r\n  assistance of counsel, a PCR applicant must prove: (1) counsel's performance\r\n  was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the applicant's\r\n  case).Â  \r\n2.Â \r\n  When the revocation judge revoked Hook's probation in full, he cited the\r\n  following grounds: (1) failure to report; (2) conviction for writing fraudulent\r\n  checks; and (3) failure to follow his probation agent's advice.Â  Because the\r\n  charges pending against Hook were not the reason for revoking his probation,\r\n  Hook again failed to prove the prejudice prong of Strickland v. Washington.\r\n  466 U.S. at 687.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., CURETON, A.J., and GOOLSBY, A.J.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-101","title":"Harrell v.
