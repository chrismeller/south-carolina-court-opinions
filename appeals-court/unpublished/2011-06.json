On appeal, Maxson argues the ALC\r\n  erred in reversing the hearing officer because the arresting officer did not\r\n  meet his burden of proof by failing to present evidence at the license\r\n  suspension hearing that Maxson was lawfully arrested or detained. We affirm[1] pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities: S.C.

App.\r\n  2010) (finding &quot;an implied consent hearing is not a trial in regard\r\n  to the guilt or innocence of the defendant on a DUI charge,&quot; and, thus,\r\n  &quot;[a] finding of probable cause may be based upon less evidence than would\r\n  be necessary to support a conviction.&quot;).[2]Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J.,\r\n  PIEPER, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Maxson also argued on appeal that the ALC did not\r\n  have the authority to change a &quot;finding of fact&quot; by the hearing\r\n  officer; however, the ALC did not reverse a finding of fact.Â  The hearing\r\n  officer ruled as &quot;a matter of law&quot; under his &quot;conclusions of law&quot;\r\n  that the Department had not met its burden of proof.Â  The hearing officer\r\n  explained under this legal ruling that, &quot;[t]he smell of alcohol about\r\n  [Maxson's] breath and the failing of the field sobriety tests are evidence of\r\n  impairment; however, those factors alone do [not] establish probable cause that\r\n  [Maxson] was materially and appreciably impaired at the time of the stop.&quot;\r\n  Â Furthermore, &quot;[a]lthough the question of whether probable cause exists is\r\n  ordinarily a jury question, it may be decided as a matter of law when the\r\n  evidence yields but one conclusion.&quot; Law v.

(Employer) did not benefit from\r\n  Burton's activity.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nThis court will affirm the\r\n  decision of the Appellate Panel if it is supported by substantial evidence.Â \r\n  S.C.

Â \r\nAccordingly, the decision of\r\n  the Appellate Panel is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J., THOMAS\r\n  and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] We decline to address Burton's argument concerning\r\n  the private errand rule because it is unpreserved for our review.Â  Burton\r\n  failed to raise the argument to the Appellate Panel.Â  See Rodney v.\r\n    Michelin Tire Corp.,&nbsp; 320 S.C. 515, 517, 466 S.E.2d 357,\r\n  358&nbsp;(1996) (noting arguments\r\n  must be raised to the Appellate Panel in order to be preserved for review on\r\n  appeal).\r\n[3] We find Burton's argument that the Appellate Panel\r\n  made an error of law by misapplying Hicks v.

Anderson, Eric M. Johnsen, all of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\n        H.\r\n          Brewton Hagood, James A. Bruorton, IV, R. Britton Kelly, all of Charleston, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM: This\r\n  appeal stems from a construction defect suit filed by McGonigal's Flamingo,\r\n  Inc. (McGonigal), against RJG Construction Co., (RJG) for construction of the\r\n  Ocean Sands II (the hotel) in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.Â  RJG filed a\r\n  third-party action against several subcontractors, which included Coastal Glass\r\n  Company (Coastal).Â  RJG and many of the subcontractors settled with McGonigal;\r\n  however, Coastal did not.Â  RJG filed a contribution claim against Coastal and\r\n  filed a motion for summary judgment on the basis that Coastal's work was one\r\n  of the proximate causes of the water intrusion in the hotel.Â  The circuit court\r\n  concluded Coastal was a joint tortfeasor under the South Carolina Contribution\r\n  Among Tortfeasors Act (the Act) and awarded RJG $211,700 plus $8,170.75 in\r\n  pre-judgment interest.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Coastal argues the circuit court erred in (1) granting summary judgment\r\n  in favor of RJG's contribution claim because genuine issues of material fact\r\n  exist as to whether Coastal's work contributed to the water intrusion damage of\r\n  the hotel; (2) determining the number of tortfeasors for purposes of\r\n  calculating the pro rata share of liability; (3) determining the common\r\n  liability amounted to $1,058,500 and concluding Coastal's pro rata share of that\r\n  liability amounted to $211,700; and (4) awarding RJG $8,170.75 in pre-judgment\r\n  interest.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\n1. Coastal\r\n  argues genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether its work contributed\r\n  to the water intrusion of the hotel because a jury could find the water\r\n  intrusion resulted from alternative sources such as: (1) McGonigal's failure to\r\n  properly maintain sealants; (2) the architect's failure to include flashing on\r\n  the architectural plans; and (3) hotel guests sitting on the Packaged Terminal\r\n  Air Conditioner (PTAC) units, resulting in the failure of the units' sealants.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  concluding Coastal was a joint tortfeasor, the circuit court noted the testimony of\r\n  Mike Adams, Coastal's Rule 30(b)(6), SCRCP witness, and Coastal's expert\r\n  witness, George Barbour.Â  During the deposition, Adams was asked, &quot;So to\r\n  the extent those fasteners [window fasteners that attached the window sill to\r\n  the concrete slab] provided an avenue for water intrusion into the building [,]\r\n  that would be attributed to Coastal Glass' scope of work?&quot;Â  In response,\r\n  Adams stated, &quot;Yes.&quot;Â  Moreover, Barbour admitted in his deposition\r\n  that Coastal's work was a source of water intrusion in the hotel.Â  Based on the\r\n  testimony of Adams and Barbour, we affirm the circuit court's grant of summary judgment\r\n  in favor of RJG on the basis that Coastal was a joint tortfeasor.Â  See Rule 56(c), SCRCP (stating summary judgment is appropriate when\r\n  there is no genuine issue of material fact such that the moving party must\r\n  prevail as a matter of law).\r\n2.\r\n  Coastal asserts the circuit court erred in determining the total number of\r\n  tortfeasors when it calculated the pro rata share of Coastal's liability.Â \r\n  Specifically, Coastal asserts Pegram Associates, Inc. (Pegram), the architect\r\n  of the hotel, is a tortfeasor for purposes of calculating the pro rata share of\r\n  liability because the architectural plans did not require flashing at the heads\r\n  and sills of the windows and sliding glass doors.Â  As a result, Coastal\r\n  contends Pegram's failure to include flashing in the architectural plans constitutes\r\n  a design defect that resulted in water intrusion of the hotel.\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court's order noted Pegram &quot;did not manufacture or install any\r\n  exterior component of the building and any issues related to deficiencies in\r\n  the exterior waterproofing design of the Ocean Sands II was taken into\r\n  consideration in the discounted settlement amount.&quot;Â  We agree that any\r\n  design deficiencies relating to Pegram's failure to include flashing on the windows\r\n  and sliding glass doors were taken into consideration in discounting the\r\n  settlement amount.Â  Particularly, Paragraph 3 of the settlement agreement\r\n  provides,\r\n\r\n  [McGonigals']\r\n    alleged damages in this case, including loss of use, were in excess of $2,800,000\r\n    and [McGonigal] has significantly discounted its alleged damages taking into\r\n    consideration design deficiency issues, owner material selection issues,\r\n    and a variable business market to compromise on a reasonable settlement of\r\n    $1,200,000.00.Â  (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Coastal contends McGonigal should be considered a tortfeasor for purposes of\r\n  determining the pro rata share of liability because McGonigal failed to\r\n  properly maintain the sealant joints and perform routine maintenance of the\r\n  hotel.Â  We conclude Coastal's argument is without merit because a plaintiff\r\n  cannot be a tortfeasor for its own injuries.Â  See G&amp;P Trucking v.\r\n    Parks Auto Sales Serv. &amp; Salvage, Inc., 357 S.C. 82, 90, 591 S.E.2d 42,\r\n  46 (Ct. App. 2003) (stating an injured party cannot be a tortfeasor, let alone\r\n  a joint tortfeasor, as to its own injury).\r\n3.\r\n  Coastal further contends the circuit court erred in interpreting common\r\n  liability pursuant to the Act and argues common liability is the &quot;amount\r\n  representing the total damages caused by the negligence of all\r\n  defendants.&quot;Â  Based on this definition, Coastal claims the total\r\n  settlement agreement amount of $1,200,000 represents the common liability and\r\n  that this amount should be divided by (1) the ten settling tortfeasors or (2)\r\n  the ten settling tortfeasors plus Coastal.Â  In addition, Coastal argues the\r\n  circuit court's calculation of Coastal's pro rata share of liability in the\r\n  amount of $211,700 was improper.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  determining common liability, the circuit court noted the settlement agreement\r\n  allocated $1,058,500 to water intrusion damage of the hotel.Â  The circuit court\r\n  then divided the common liability of $1,058,500 by the five tortfeasors who\r\n  settled for water intrusion damage.Â  We conclude the circuit court did not err\r\n  in finding the $1,058,500 represents the appropriate amount of common\r\n  liability, and Coastal's pro rata share of the common liability amounted to\r\n  $211,700.Â  The circuit court properly considered equitable principles in\r\n  calculating the common liability in determining the pro rata share.[1]Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-38-30 (2005) (stating in pertinent part, if\r\n  equity requires, the collective liability of some as a group shall constitute a\r\n  single share).\r\n4.\r\n  Finally, Coastal argues RJG is barred from recovering pre-judgment interest\r\n  because South Carolina case law requires a party to plead pre-judgment\r\n  interest.Â  The record reveals RJG failed to plead pre-judgment interest.Â \r\n  Therefore, the circuit court's award of pre-judgment interest constitutes\r\n  reversible error.Â  See Tilley v. Pacesetter Corp., 355 S.C. 361,\r\n  375-76, 585 S.E.2d 292, 299 (2003) (holding pre-judgment interest was not\r\n  recoverable when the party claiming entitlement to pre-judgment interest did not\r\n  plead pre-judgment interest).\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the circuit court's decision is\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.\r\nFEW,\r\n  C.J., SHORT and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Coastal argues\r\n  the allocation of damages of the building envelope is &quot;not based upon any\r\n  discernable factual basis when it is noted that within that group are the\r\n  tub/shower enclosures, which do not make up a portion of the exterior envelope\r\n  and those excluded from the group include those responsible for the roof, the\r\n  exterior balconies and walkways, and the designer of the exterior envelope and\r\n  its waterproofing, the architect.&quot;Â Â  However, Coastal did not dispute the\r\n  reasonableness of the settlement agreement at the summary judgment hearing. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-261","title":"State v.

Jackson, Jr, of Santee, for Guardian\r\n          Ad Litem.\r\n        Roberta S., of Orangeburg, for Defendant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Charlese B. (Mother) appeals the family court's denial\r\n  of sanctions pursuant to Rule 11, SCRCP, against the South Carolina Department\r\n  of Social Services (the Department).[1]Â \r\n  Specifically, Mother argues the family court's ruling that the Department's\r\n  actions in removing Child from Mother was not improperly motivated still\r\n  permits the imposition of Rule 11, SCRCP, sanctions because a prior family\r\n  court judge held the Department lacked probable cause to take Child into\r\n  emergency protective custody. In addition, Mother also asserts the family court\r\n  erred in not considering her supplemental memorandum in regard to her Rule 11,\r\n  SCRCP, motion.Â  \r\nIn support of her argument, Mother\r\n  contends the Department's basis for probable cause in removing Child was\r\n  inaccurate.Â  The Department placed Child into emergency protective custody on the\r\n  mistaken belief that Child tested positive for cocaine at her birth in November\r\n  2008.Â  However, the Department later determined it was actually Mother's other\r\n  child, who was born ten months earlier in January 2008, who had tested positive\r\n  for cocaine.Â  As a result, Mother argues the Department's signature on the\r\n  Notice of Emergency Custody Actions violated the requirement of Rule 11 that good\r\n  grounds exist to remove Child because an investigation would have revealed\r\n  Child did not test positive for cocaine at birth.Â  See Rule 11, SCRCP\r\n  (&quot;The signature of an attorney or party constitutes a certificate by him\r\n  that he has read the pleading, motion or other paper; that to the best of his\r\n  knowledge, information and belief there is good ground to support it . . .\r\n  .&quot;).\r\nMother also contends the\r\n  family court erred in concluding a merits finding in favor of the Department\r\n  precludes Rule 11, SCRCP sanctions under Creighton v. Coligny Plaza Ltd. P'ship,\r\n  334 S.C. 96, 512 S.E.2d 510 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nIn deciding on Mother's Rule\r\n  11, SCRCP motion, the family court denied Mother's relief pursuant to the\r\n  Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act rather than pursuant to Rule 11,\r\n  SCRCP.Â  It was incumbent upon Mother to make a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion when\r\n  the family court's order was inconsistent with her requested relief for\r\n  sanctions under Rule 11, SCRCP.Â  Therefore, we affirm the family court's grant of summary judgment in\r\n  favor of the Department pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following\r\n  authority:Â  Bennett v. Rector,&nbsp; 389 S.C. 274, 284, 697 S.E.2d 715,\r\n  720&nbsp;(Ct.

Goldstein, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: David Hauge (&quot;Hauge&quot;)\r\n  appeals the trial court's order denying summary judgment and dismissing the\r\n  action without prejudice pursuant to Rule 12(b)(8), SCRCP.Â  Hauge first argues\r\n  Adrienne Curran (&quot;Curran&quot;) conceded the funds generated from the sale\r\n  of property owned by Chidna, L.L.C. were not Curran's personal property. Â Therefore,\r\n  based on Curran's admission, Hauge argues there is no genuine issue of material\r\n  fact as to the conversion or breach of fiduciary duty causes of action, and\r\n  summary judgment should have been granted.Â  Second, Hauge contends the trial\r\n  court improperly dismissed the South Carolina action because the pending Florida\r\n  litigation between Hauge and Curran is not another action pending between the\r\n  same parties for the same claim under Rule 12(b)(8).Â  Finally, Hauge asserts\r\n  the trial court improperly overruled the prior trial court judge's order\r\n  denying Curran's motion to dismiss.Â  Pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR and the\r\n  following authorities,[1] we affirm the trial court's decision to deny summary judgment, reverse its\r\n  decision to dismiss the South Carolina action, and remand the matter for\r\n  further proceedings. \r\n1.&nbsp;As to whether a\r\n  genuine issue of material fact exists on the conversion and breach of fiduciary\r\n  duty causes of action: See Moore v. Weinberg,&nbsp; 383\r\n  S.C. 583, 589, 681 S.E.2d 875, 878-79&nbsp;(2009) (finding conflicting\r\n  testimony regarding the ownership of an interest in the proceeds from\r\n  litigation created a genuine issue of material fact as to the conversion\r\n  claim); Helms Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 340, 611\r\n  S.E.2d 485, 488 (2005) (&quot;Summary judgment is appropriate 'if the\r\n  pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\r\n  together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to\r\n  any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a\r\n  matter of law.'&quot;); Gadson v.

Co. of N.Y., 191 S.C. 314, 317-18, 4 S.E.2d 261, 262 (1939) (&quot;[A]n action\r\n  may be pleaded in abatement of a second suit only when between the same parties\r\n  and in the same jurisdiction and with the same object.&quot;) (emphasis\r\n  added); see also Logan v. Atlanta &amp; C. Air Line R. Co., 82\r\n  S.C. 518, 520-21, 64 S.E. 515, 516 (1909) (stating that a pending action in the\r\n  federal court against the lessee of a railroad for personal injuries is no bar\r\n  to an action in the state courts against the lessor on the same cause of action\r\n  because the suits are against different parties and in different jurisdictions); Hill v.

Brittain, Mary Madison B.\r\n          Langway, and Andrew Preston Brittain, all of Myrtle Beach, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: C.S.E.\r\n  Enterprises, Inc., d/b/a RE/MAX at the Coast and Tom Naomi (collectively Naomi)\r\n  appeal the order of the interim master holding Naomi was not entitled to a real\r\n  estate commission.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nScott Lemons secured an\r\n  option to purchase a fifteen-acre tract of waterfront property from John\r\n  Delduco.Â  Although Lemons was a realtor, he contacted Naomi, a real estate agent\r\n  for RE/MAX at the Coast, about marketing the property.Â  On September 27, 2006,\r\n  Lemons and Naomi executed a listing agreement which provided Lemons would pay Naomi\r\n  a commission of ten percent of the gross selling price if Naomi procured &quot;a\r\n  party ready, willing and able&quot; to purchase the property.Â  The next day the\r\n  parties executed a similar agreement, which provided a more detailed description\r\n  of the property and set the selling price as $3,400,000.Â  \r\nIn October, a potential\r\n  purchaser, Kenny Hyatt, contacted Naomi about the property.Â  Hyatt executed a\r\n  buyer agency contract and a dual agency agreement with Naomi on October 28,\r\n  2006.Â  He then made an offer on the property for $2,900,000, which Lemons\r\n  accepted that same day.Â  When Lemons signed the purchase agreement, he also\r\n  hand-wrote and signed an agreement, which provided:Â  &quot;I Scott Lemons agree\r\n  to pay RE/MAX at the Coast (Ref. Tom Naomi) a 10% commission upon close of the\r\n  referenced prop. on the waterway approx. 15 ac. with contract for/with Kenny\r\n  Hyatt.&quot;Â  The purchase agreement contained no contingencies and provided\r\n  for a closing date of November 23, 2006.Â  \r\nHyatt had intended to\r\n  immediately resell (flip) the property.Â  When he was unable to find a buyer, he\r\n  refused to close on the property.Â  Because Hyatt refused to close, Lemons did\r\n  not exercise his option to purchase the property.Â  On December 19, 2006, Naomi\r\n  brought this action against Lemons and his company, Gold Coast Resorts, LLC,\r\n  seeking payment of $290,000 as the real estate commission.Â  Lemons filed a\r\n  third-party complaint against Hyatt for breach of contract and specific\r\n  performance.Â  The action was referred to the master-in-equity, the Honorable J.\r\n  Stanton Cross.Â  Prior to trial, Hyatt settled with Lemons for $5,000 and with\r\n  Naomi for $20,000.Â  \r\nJudge Cross found Hyatt's\r\n  testimony established that he had no intention of consummating the transaction\r\n  unless he could flip the property, did not have the wherewithal to consummate\r\n  the transaction, and never sought financing for the property.Â  He found this\r\n  conduct violated the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and displayed a\r\n  volitional unwillingness to meet his contractual obligations.Â  However, Judge\r\n  Cross held volitional unwillingness was not a ground for cancellation or a\r\n  defense in a breach of contract action.Â  Thus, he concluded Naomi had fully\r\n  performed the requirements of the real estate commission agreement and earned\r\n  the commission when he procured Hyatt as a purchaser who was accepted by Lemons\r\n  and who entered into a valid and enforceable contract with Lemons.Â  He granted\r\n  Naomi a judgment for $270,000, allowing for a set-off for the settlement paid\r\n  by Hyatt.Â  \r\nLemons timely filed a motion\r\n  to alter or amend.Â  Due to the illness of Judge Cross, the motion was heard by\r\n  the interim master-in-equity, the Honorable Ralph P. Stroman.Â  Judge Stroman\r\n  found Hyatt's fraudulent misrepresentation to the parties made the original\r\n  purchase agreement null and void.Â  Thus, he concluded Hyatt was never a\r\n  legitimate buyer and no duty to pay a commission resulted.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;An action for a broker's\r\n  commission is an action at law.&quot; Â Springs &amp; Davenport, Inc. v. AAG,\r\n    Inc., 385 S.C. 320, 325, 683 S.E.2d 814, 816 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  In a law\r\n  action tried before a master, this court's review is limited to the correction\r\n  of errors of law, and the findings of fact of the master will not be disturbed\r\n  upon appeal unless found to be without evidence that reasonably supports the\r\n  master's findings. Â Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C.\r\n  81, 85-86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976). Â &quot;Where mixed questions of fact and\r\n  law are presented, the legal conclusions to be drawn are not entitled to the\r\n  same deference.&quot; Â Springs &amp; Davenport, Inc., 385 S.C. at 325,\r\n  683 S.E.2d at 816.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Interim Master's\r\n  Authority\r\nNaomi argues the interim\r\n  master erred in granting Lemons' motion to alter or amend and reversing Judge\r\n  Cross without reviewing the trial transcript or recalling witnesses.Â  Naomi\r\n  never objected to Judge Stroman making his own findings of fact or conclusions\r\n  of law on the motion to alter or amend, never requested Judge Stroman recall\r\n  witnesses, and never questioned whether Judge Stroman had reviewed the\r\n  transcript.Â  Accordingly, this argument is not preserved. Â See Wilder\r\n    Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (&quot;It is\r\n  axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must\r\n  have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for\r\n  appellate review.&quot;); see also State v. Oxner, 391 S.C. 132,\r\n  134, 705 S.E.2d 51, 52 (2011) (&quot;Even though subject matter jurisdiction\r\n  may be raised at any time, there is no error preservation exception allowing a\r\n  party to bypass calling an erroneous ruling to the attention of the tribunal\r\n  making it before appealing that ruling to a higher court.&quot;).\r\nII.Â  Commission\r\nNaomi argues the interim\r\n  master erred in finding Naomi had not earned his commission.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n&quot;As a general rule, a\r\n  broker has earned his commission when . . . he procures a purchaser who is\r\n  accepted by the owner of the property and with whom the latter, uninfluenced by\r\n  any representation of fraud on the part of the broker, enters into a valid and\r\n  enforceable contract.&quot; Â Cass Co. v. Nannarello, 274 S.C. 326, 328,\r\n  262 S.E.2d 924, 926 (1980).Â  &quot;[S]uch right to compensation will not be\r\n  defeated by the failure or refusal of the purchaser to consummate the contract.&quot;Â  Id. Â However, the broker and owner may set their own terms in the\r\n  contract for the broker's services and &quot;may make the payment of the broker's\r\n  commission dependent upon the full performance of the contract of purchase or\r\n  sale, or postpone the payment of the commission, or make the broker's right to\r\n  the commission contingent upon the happening of future events.&quot;Â  Hamrick\r\n    v. Cooper River Lumber Co., 223 S.C. 119, 124, 74 S.E.2d 575, 577 (1953). Â &quot;Where\r\n  the obligation of the principal to pay commissions depends upon the performance\r\n  of conditions precedent, the broker takes the risk of nonperformance on the\r\n  part of the customer.&quot; Â Id.\r\n\r\n  Each of\r\n    the words &quot;ready,&quot; &quot;willing,&quot; and &quot;able&quot;\r\n    expresses an idea that the others do not convey. Â All three of these elements\r\n    must exist in the customer, in order to entitle the broker to a commission. Â It\r\n    is not sufficient that the customer is ready and willing, but he or she must\r\n    also have the ability to carry out the loan, sale, purchase, or exchange. Â So\r\n    also, the procurement of a ready, willing, and able purchaser by a broker\r\n    involves not only a showing that the purchaser has the financial ability to\r\n    complete the contract, but also that the purchaser is ready and willing to\r\n    purchase at a price and on terms prescribed by the vendor.\r\n\r\nThe Huffines Co., LLC v.\r\n  Lockhart, 365 S.C. 178, 191-92, 617 S.E.2d\r\n  125, 131-32 (Ct. App. 2005) (quoting 12 C.J.S. Brokers Â§ 225 (2004)\r\n  (footnotes omitted by court)).\r\nJudge Stroman held Hyatt was\r\n  not a buyer as contemplated by the parties' agreement and thus no commission\r\n  was earned.Â  The first two listing agreements provided Naomi earned the\r\n  commission when he procured a &quot;ready, willing, and able&quot; purchaser.Â  However,\r\n  the handwritten agreement did not include such a provision.Â  \r\n\r\n  Where\r\n    instruments entered into by the same parties at different times relate to the\r\n    same subject matter, the instruments will be construed together to determine\r\n    the entire agreement between the parties. If the provisions of one instrument\r\n    limit, explain, or otherwise affect the provisions of the other, they will be\r\n    given effect to accomplish the entire agreement between the parties. \r\n\r\nBishop Realty &amp;\r\n  Rentals, Inc. v. Perk, Inc., 292 S.C.\r\n  182, 184-85, 355 S.E.2d 298, 300 (Ct. App. 1987) (citations omitted).\r\nAlthough the handwritten\r\n  agreement did not include the &quot;ready, willing, and able&quot; language, we\r\n  find that in construing all of the instruments together, Naomi was required to\r\n  procure a &quot;ready, willing, and able&quot; purchaser to earn the\r\n  commission.Â  We further find Hyatt did not meet this description.\r\nNaomi testified he believed\r\n  Hyatt had the financial means to close the transaction because according to the\r\n  tax records, Hyatt owned many other properties, including ones on the\r\n  waterway.Â  However, the record contains no evidence that Hyatt had $2,900,000\r\n  available on the date of the closing.Â  Hyatt testified that when he entered\r\n  into the sales contract, he did not have the financial ability to close on the\r\n  property.Â  He stated he could not close on the property without being able to\r\n  flip it to another buyer and never found a buyer.Â  He explained he believed he\r\n  would only lose his $10,000 earnest money by defaulting on the contract.Â  \r\nWe find Hyatt was not ready,\r\n  willing, or able to purchase the property.Â  Thus, Naomi did not procure a\r\n  ready, willing, and able buyer and did not earn a commission.Â  \r\nNaomi's counsel stated at\r\n  oral argument Lemons had admitted Hyatt was a ready, willing, and able buyer in\r\n  his answer.Â  In his complaint Naomi alleged: &quot;On or about October 28,\r\n  2006, the Plaintiff procured a buyer, Kenny Hyatt, as a party ready, willing\r\n  and able to purchase the property . . . .&quot;Â  Lemons admitted this\r\n  allegation in his answer.Â  Naomi never asserted at trial Lemons was bound by\r\n  the admission in the answer and the issue of whether Hyatt was a ready, willing,\r\n  and able buyer was contested at trial.Â  We find Naomi's argument concerning the\r\n  admission in Lemons' answer is not properly before this court and furthermore, the\r\n  issue of whether Hyatt was in fact a ready, willing, and able buyer was tried\r\n  by consent.Â  See Wilder Corp., 330 S.C. at 76, 497 S.E.2d at 733 (&quot;It\r\n  is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but\r\n  must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for\r\n  appellate review.&quot;); McCurry v. Keith, 325 S.C. 441, 447, 481\r\n  S.E.2d 166, 169 (Ct. App. 1997) (&quot;When issues not raised in the pleadings\r\n  are tried by consent, they will be treated as if they had been raised in the\r\n  pleadings.&quot;).\r\nNaomi's counsel also asserted\r\n  at oral argument Lemons's counsel acknowledged at the hearing before Judge\r\n  Stroman that Lemons believed Hyatt was a ready, willing, and able buyer.Â  In\r\n  our review of the hearing, we find Lemons's counsel did not concede Hyatt was a\r\n  ready, willing, and able buyer.Â  Instead, he was explaining Lemons's belief at\r\n  the time Lemons entered into the handwritten agreement.Â  Lemons' counsel clearly\r\n  argued at the hearing that Hyatt did not fit the definition of a ready, willing,\r\n  and able buyer.Â  Thus, we find no merit to this argument.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Consideration of\r\n  Settlement with Hyatt\r\nNaomi argues the interim\r\n  master erred in considering the partial settlement between the parties.Â  Hyatt\r\n  settled with Lemons for $5,000 and with Naomi for $20,000.Â  Judge Cross's order\r\n  mentioned the settlement in allowing for a set-off from his award to Naomi.Â  \r\nNaomi\r\n  failed to raise this issue to Judge Stroman.Â  Accordingly, it is not\r\n  preserved.Â  Wilder Corp., 330 S.C. at 76, 497 S.E.2d at 733 (&quot;It is\r\n  axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must\r\n  have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for\r\n  appellate review.&quot;).\r\nIV.Â  Gold Coast as a Party\r\nNaomi argues the interim\r\n  master erred in finding that Gold Coast Resorts, LLC, had been dismissed from\r\n  the case.Â  In listing the attorneys who represented the parties at the hearing\r\n  on the motion to alter or amend, Judge Stroman noted: Â &quot;Gold Coast\r\n  Resorts, LLC, had been dismissed earlier.&quot;Â  In his brief, Lemons\r\n  acknowledges that Gold Coast Resorts, LLC, is still a party to the action.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the master's order is modified to reflect Gold Coast Resorts, LLC,\r\n  is still a party to the action.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold Judge\r\n  Stroman correctly found Naomi was not entitled to the real estate commission.Â \r\n  However, we find Judge Stroman erred in noting Gold Coast Resorts, LLC, had\r\n  been dismissed from the action.Â  Accordingly, the order of Judge Stroman is \r\nAFFIRMED AS\r\n  MODIFIED.\r\nHUFF,\r\n  KONDUROS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-267","title":"State v.

Shupe, all of Columbia, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Vince\r\n  Neal Way appeals the trial court's order committing him to the Department of\r\n  Mental Health for long term control, care, and treatment after a jury found\r\n  that Way satisfied the definition of a sexually violent predator pursuant to the\r\n  Sexually Violent Predator Act (SVP Act), S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 44-48-10 to -170 (Supp.\r\n  2010).Â  Way argues the trial court erred (1) in allowing the State to present\r\n  evidence of a 1995 criminal sexual conduct (CSC) charge that was later\r\n  dismissed because DNA evidence proved that he was not guilty; (2) in allowing\r\n  the victim of his 1993 CSC conviction to testify; and (3) in allowing the State to question him regarding whether he\r\n  retained an expert to conduct a second mental evaluation.Â  Further, Way asserts\r\n  the trial court erred when it allowed the State to tell the jury that it could\r\n  infer the absence of Way's retained expert meant that the expert's testimony\r\n  would have been adverse to his case.\r\nBecause we find the trial court\r\n  made no reversible error, we affirm.[1]Â  \r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence of a Prior Conviction\r\nWay asserts the trial court\r\n  erred in allowing the State to present evidence of the 1995 CSC charge that was\r\n  later dismissed because DNA evidence proved that he was not guilty.Â  Way states\r\n  the probative value of that evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger\r\n  of unfair prejudice.Â  He alleges the jury was led to believe he was guilty of\r\n  the CSC charge when, in fact, he pled guilty to a lesser charge.Â  However,\r\n  Way's argument is based on an erroneous interpretation of the sequence of\r\n  events and testimony at trial.Â  Despite the trial court's ruling that this\r\n  evidence was admissible, the State ultimately abandoned the introduction of\r\n  this evidence.Â  Therefore, we find no reversible error in the trial court's\r\n  ruling.Â  Â Â \r\nThe admission of evidence is\r\n  within the sound discretion of the court and will not be reversed absent a\r\n  showing of abuse of discretion. Â In re Corley, 353 S.C. 202, 205, 577\r\n  S.E.2d 451, 453 (2003); see also State v. Wise, 359 S.C. 14, 21,\r\n  596 S.E.2d 475, 478&nbsp;(2004) (&quot;The admission or exclusion of evidence\r\n  is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and its ruling\r\n  will not be disturbed in the absence of a manifest abuse of discretion\r\n  accompanied by probable prejudice.&quot;).Â  &quot;The trial judge is given\r\n  broad discretion in ruling on questions concerning the relevancy of evidence,\r\n  and his decision will be reversed only if there is a clear abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  State v. Aleksey, 343 S.C. 20, 35, 538 S.E.2d 248, 256&nbsp;(2000). \r\n&quot;Generally, all relevant\r\n  evidence is admissible.&quot;Â  State v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 578, 647\r\n  S.E.2d 144, 170 (2007); see also Rule 402, SCRE.Â  Evidence is relevant\r\n  if it has &quot;any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of\r\n  consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable\r\n  than it would be without the evidence.&quot; Â Rule 401, SCRE; State v.\r\n    Livingston, 327 S.C. 17, 19-20, 488 S.E.2d 313, 314 (1997).Â  On the other\r\n  hand, relevant evidence may be excluded where its probative value is substantially\r\n  outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.Â  Rule 403, SCRE; State v.\r\n    Brazell, 325 S.C. 65, 78, 480 S.E.2d 64, 72 (1997).Â  Â \r\nUnder the SVP Act, a sexually\r\n  violent predator is defined as a person who &quot;(a) has been convicted of a\r\n  sexually violent offense; and (b) suffers from a mental abnormality or\r\n  personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in acts of sexual\r\n  violence if not confined in a secure facility for long-term control, care, and\r\n  treatment.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(1)(a)-(b) (Supp. 2010).Â \r\n  &quot;Mental abnormality&quot; is defined as &quot;a mental condition affecting\r\n  a person's emotional or volitional capacity that predisposes the person to\r\n  commit sexually violent offenses.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(3) (Supp.\r\n  2010).Â  The phrase &quot;likely to engage in acts of sexual violence&quot; is\r\n  defined as a &quot;propensity to commit acts of sexual violence . . . of such a\r\n  degree as to pose a menace to the health and safety of others.&quot;Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(9) (Supp. 2010). \r\nIn 1993, Way pled guilty to\r\n  committing a lewd act upon a minor and was sentenced to ten years'\r\n  imprisonment, suspended upon service of 18 months' imprisonment plus five\r\n  years' probation.Â  In 1995, while on probation, Way was arrested for CSC and\r\n  pled guilty to contributing to the delinquency of a minor.Â  In 1997, while on\r\n  probation from the prior convictions, Way pled guilty to committing a lewd act\r\n  upon a minor and was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment.Â  \r\nAt Way's civil commitment\r\n  proceeding, the State sought to admit testimony from the State's retained\r\n  psychiatrist regarding the 1995 CSC charge to show Way had a dangerous\r\n  propensity to commit violent sexual acts.Â  Way objected to the admission of the\r\n  1995 CSC charge as it had later been determined that he did not commit the\r\n  crime.Â  The court overruled the objection, stating that the testimony was more\r\n  probative than prejudicial, that it was relevant, and that it helped to form\r\n  the foundation of the expert witness's opinion.Â  Nevertheless, when direct\r\n  examination continued, the State only questioned the witness regarding Way's &quot;contributing\r\n  to the delinquency&quot; plea.Â  The State never mentioned in the jury's presence\r\n  that Way was indicted for CSC.Â  Therefore, no prejudice occurred to Way as a\r\n  result of the trial court's ruling that allowed the State to question the\r\n  witness regarding the CSC charge.Â  The only mention of anything sexual in\r\n  nature regarding the CSC charge was during cross-examination by Way's own trial\r\n  counsel.Â  Hence, Way cannot complain on appeal regarding the introduction of\r\n  testimony that he elicited.Â  Gissel v. Hart, 382 S.C. 235, 243, 676\r\n  S.E.2d 320, 324 (2009); see also Erickson v. Jones St. Publishers,\r\n    LLC, 368 S.C. 444, 476, 629 S.E.2d 653, 670 (2006) (stating a party may not\r\n  complain on appeal of an error that his own conduct produced).Â  Because we find\r\n  that no error occurred in the admission of evidence, we affirm the trial court's\r\n  ruling.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Testimony of a Prior Victim of CSC \r\nWay argues the trial court\r\n  erred in allowing the victim of his 1993 CSC conviction to testify.Â  Way\r\n  contends that because he pled guilty to the charge and stipulated that the\r\n  offense was a qualifying offense under the SVP Act, and because the forensic\r\n  psychiatrist had already testified to the events surrounding the conviction,\r\n  the victim's testimony served only to bolster the expert testimony.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\n&quot;Under the SVP Act, the State\r\n  bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that a person is a\r\n  sexually violent predator.&quot;Â  In re Corley, 353 S.C. at 206, 577 S.E.2d\r\n  at 453; see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-100(A)(2010) (&quot;The court or\r\n  jury must determine whether, beyond a reasonable doubt, the person is a\r\n  sexually violent predator.&quot;).Â  In Corley, appellant moved to\r\n  prevent the details of his prior convictions, including a CSC conviction, from\r\n  being admitted into evidence.Â  Appellant admitted to the convictions but stated\r\n  that &quot;the details surrounding his prior offenses were not necessary and\r\n  admission of the information would be prejudicial.&quot;Â  Id. at 204,\r\n  577 S.E.2d at 452.Â  The State's expert and appellant's expert testified\r\n  regarding appellant's mental abnormality and personality disorder that made it\r\n  likely that he would engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a\r\n  secure facility for long-term control, care, and treatment.Â  \r\nThe State was allowed to\r\n  admit the details of the defendant's prior sexual offenses that triggered the\r\n  SVP Act in order to establish that he was a sexually violent predator.Â  Our\r\n  supreme court stated that &quot;[p]ast criminal history is therefore directly\r\n  relevant to establishing section 44-48-30(1)(a) [of the SVP Act, defining a\r\n  sexually violent predator as a person who has been convicted of a sexually\r\n  violent offense].Â  As such, the State was not required to accept appellant's\r\n  stipulation.&quot;Â  Id. at 206, 577 S.E.2d at 453.Â  \r\nIn this case, Way moved to\r\n  exclude testimony from the victim of his 1993 offense.Â  The trial court granted\r\n  the motion in part and denied it in part.Â  Â Â The trial court stated,\r\n\r\n  But the\r\n    specifics of the offense were not admissible.Â  They're extremely prejudicial,\r\n    and they're not probative . . . She can testify as to the time period that it\r\n    took place, where it took place, and in whose presence it took place.Â  Because\r\n    that goes to his lack of judgment in terms of him doing it in the presence of\r\n    her brother.Â  And the length of time goes to his propensity, and that would be\r\n    the only extent to which testimony can be elicited.\r\n\r\nThe victim proceeded to\r\n  testify but unlike Corley, evidence was not admitted that revealed the\r\n  details of the offense.Â  The victim merely stated the time frame, location and who\r\n  was present during the abuse.Â  We believe allowing this evidence did not constitute\r\n  error in that it was cumulative testimony that served to establish Way met the\r\n  requirements of a sexually violent predator under the Act.Â  Yet assuming\r\n  arguendo that is was admitted in error, the error does not warrant reversal.Â  \r\n&quot;In order for an error\r\n  to warrant reversal, the error must result in prejudice to the appellant.&quot;Â  State v. Preslar,\r\n  364 S.C. 466, 473, 613 S.E.2d 381, 385 (Ct. App. 2005); see also State\r\n    v. Wyatt, 317 S.C. 370, 372, 453 S.E.2d 890, 891 (1995) (stating that error\r\n  without prejudice does not warrant reversal).Â  &quot;[A]dmission of evidence is largely within the\r\n  discretion of the trial judge and in order to constitute reversible error in\r\n  the admission thereof, the accused must be prejudiced thereby; and the burden\r\n  is upon him to satisfy this court that there was prejudicial error.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Motley, 251 S.C. 568, 575, 164 S.E.2d 569, 572 (1968).Â  &quot;We have held that error,\r\n  if any, in the admission of certain testimony was not prejudicial where similar\r\n  testimony has been received without proper objection.&quot;Â  Id. at 575,\r\n  164 S.E.2d at 572. \r\nThe testimony\r\n  given by Way's 1993 CSC victim was not prejudicial or harmful to him because\r\n  similar testimony had already been received without proper objection.Â  Prior to\r\n  the victim's testimony, not only did the State's expert witness testify regarding\r\n  the time and place of the 1993 offense, she testified regarding details of the\r\n  offense without objection from Way.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err\r\n  in allowing the victim to testify and its ruling is affirmed. \r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Testimony Regarding Way's Second Evaluation\r\nWay argues the trial court erred in allowing the State to question\r\n  him regarding whether he retained an expert to conduct a second mental\r\n  evaluation.Â  Further, he asserts the trial court erred when it allowed the\r\n  State to tell the jury that it could infer the absence of Way's retained expert\r\n  meant that the expert's testimony would have been adverse to his case.Â  While we\r\n  agree with the trial court's decision to allow the State to cross-examine Way\r\n  regarding a second mental evaluation, we hold it was improper for the State to imply\r\n  a negative inference regarding the absence of Way's expert witness before the\r\n  jury.Â  \r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;Way's Retained ExpertÂ Â  \r\nThe State argues\r\n  that it was allowed to cross-examine Way regarding his retained expert pursuant\r\n  to the SVP Act.Â  In his assertion of\r\n  error, Way cites to Rule 26(b)(4)(B), SCRCP, and argues that he was &quot;not\r\n  required to disclose nor produce an expert who was only consulted informally,\r\n  or consulted and not retained or specially employed.&quot;Â  However, this issue\r\n  should be properly addressed according to the South Carolina Rules of Evidence\r\n  and established precedent.Â  \r\nAs mentioned above,\r\n  generally, all relevant evidence is admissible.Â  Rule 402, SCRE; Pittman,\r\n  373 S.C. at 578, 647 S.E.2d at 170.Â  Yet, relevant &quot;evidence may be\r\n  excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of\r\n  unfair prejudice. . . .&quot;Â  Rule 403, SCRE; State v. Gaster, 349 S.C.\r\n  545, 557, 564 S.E.2d 87, 94 (2002).Â  Accordingly, &quot;a trial judge has wide\r\n  latitude concerning the admissibility of evidence.&quot;Â  State v. Torres,\r\n  390 S.C. 618, 624, 703 S.E.2d 226, 229 (2010); State v. Rosemond, 335\r\n  S.C. 593, 596, 518 S.E.2d 588, 589-90 (1999).Â  Likewise, &quot;[t]he appellate\r\n  court reviews a trial judge's ruling on admissibility of evidence pursuant to\r\n  an abuse of discretion standard and gives great deference to the trial\r\n  court.&quot;Â  Torres, 390 S.C. at 625, 703 S.E.2d at 230.Â Â Â  \r\nBecause the trial court\r\n  limited the State to questions the court determined to be relevant pursuant to\r\n  the rules of evidence, it did not err in allowing the State to question Way\r\n  regarding his retained expert.Â  Therefore, we hold there was no abuse of\r\n  discretion, and the trial court's ruling is affirmed.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Negative Inference \r\nWay argues the trial court\r\n  erred in allowing the State to tell the jury it could infer that the absence of\r\n  Way's retained expert meant that his testimony would have been adverse to Way's\r\n  case.Â  He asserts the State had equal access to the witness and could have\r\n  called upon him to testify as well.Â  The State cites to Duckworth v. First\r\n    National Bank, 254 S.C. 563, 576, 176 S.E.2d 297, 304 (1970), to support its\r\n  assertion that it was proper during closing argument, to state the jury could\r\n  conclude the testimony of the absent witness would have been negative and that\r\n  it did not have equal access as the witness was in Way's control.Â  The trial\r\n  court overruled Way's objection and allowed the State to argue to the jury it\r\n  could infer the absence of Way's expert witness meant that the testimony would\r\n  have been negative.Â  While we hold this was error, it does not rise to the\r\n  level of reversible error. \r\nIn Duckworth, our\r\n  Supreme Court stated:Â Â  \r\n\r\n  It is a\r\n    well settled rule that if a party knows of the existence of an available\r\n    witness on a material issue and such witness is within his control and if\r\n    without satisfactory explanation he fails to call him, the jury may draw the\r\n    inference that the testimony of the witness would not have been favorable to\r\n    such party.Â  This inference is especially applicable where the relationship of\r\n    employer-employee exists between the parties. Â \r\n\r\nId. at 576, 176 S.E.2d at 304. \r\n&quot;Generally, the rule is\r\n  applied when the uncalled witness is an agent, employee, relation, or associate\r\n  of the party failing to call him, or within some degree of control of said\r\n  party.&quot;Â  Davis v. Sparks, 235 S.C. 326, 333, 111 S.E.2d 545, 549\r\n  (1959).Â  Further, &quot;in the absence of explanation, the failure or refusal\r\n  of a party to produce a witness may create an adverse inference,&quot; where the\r\n  party has knowledge of the witness, has the power to produce the witness and\r\n  the witness &quot;is not equally accessible to his opponent, and is such\r\n  as he would naturally produce if the witness were favorable to him.&quot;Â  Wright\r\n    v. Hiester Constr. Co., 389 S.C. 504, 525, 698 S.E.2d 822, 833 (Ct. App.\r\n  2010).Â  However, where a party lacks &quot;control&quot; over the potential\r\n  witness, an instruction of an adverse inference based on the witness's absence\r\n  is improper.Â  Davis, 235 S.C. at 333, 111 S.E.2d at 549.\r\nIn this case, there is no\r\n  indication that Way had control over the retained expert witness.Â  The witness\r\n  was hired and paid under the provisions of the SVP Act and was not an employee,\r\n  relation, or associate of Way.Â  The State could have called the expert witness,\r\n  whose absence it sought to emphasize, to testify.Â  Consequently, it was error\r\n  to allow the State to argue to the jury during its closing, &quot;Dr. Martin is\r\n  not here . . . I think the inference you can draw from that is would Dr.\r\n  Martin's testimony, if he was here, be adverse to the respondent?&quot;Â  \r\nAlthough improper, we hold this\r\n  error did not rise to the level of reversible error.Â  Evidence of Way's prior\r\n  sexual criminal history, the testimony of the State's expert witness, and the\r\n  testimony of the victim of Way's 1993 CSC offense provided relevant and\r\n  substantive evidence to support the jury's determination.Â  In light of the\r\n  entire record and testimony at trial, Way has not proven that this statement\r\n  prejudiced his case.Â  See Barrett, 299 S.C. at 488, 386 S.E.2d at 244 (&quot;Whether trial errors are\r\n  harmless depends upon the circumstances of the particular case.Â  The\r\n  materiality and prejudicial character of the error must be determined from its\r\n  relationship to the entire case.&quot;); see also State v. Mitchell,\r\n  286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985) (&quot;Error is harmless when it could\r\n  not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.&quot;) (internal\r\n  quotation marks and citation omitted).Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  GEATHERS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-269","title":"State v.

Blitch, Jr., all of Columbia; and Solicitor Christina T. Adams, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Kevin M. Ware appeals his convictions for possession with intent to distribute (PWID) crack cocaine and PWID crack cocaine within\r\nproximity of a park.&nbsp; First, he argues the trial court erred in admitting the crack cocaine into evidence because the State failed to establish a clear\r\nchain of custody. &nbsp;Specifically, Ware alleges two sets of crack cocaine might have been tested together because the Anderson Police Department's drug\r\ntracking report used the same Best Evidence Number to refer to both sets.&nbsp; Moreover, Ware also contends the evidence was insufficient to establish a chain\r\nof custody because the State's Form-B was a false affidavit.&nbsp; Second, Ware argues the trial court erred in declining to charge the jury on the\r\nlesser-included offense of possession of crack cocaine because the record contained evidence he only possessed the drugs.&nbsp; We affirm[1] pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities:&nbsp;\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to whether the trial court erred in admitting the crack cocaine into evidence: State v. Hatcher, Op. No.\r\n26950 (S.C.Sup.Ct. filed Mar. 21, 2011) (Davis Adv.Sh. No. 10 at 76) (&quot;The trial [court]'s exercise of discretion must be reviewed in the light of the\r\nfollowing factors:&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the nature of the article, the circumstances surrounding the preservation and custody of it, and the likelihood of\r\nintermeddlers tampering with it.&nbsp; If upon the consideration of such factors the trial [court] is satisfied that in reasonable probability the article has\r\nnot been changed in important respects, he may permit its introduction in evidence.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;[W]here all individuals in the chain are, in\r\nfact, identified and the manner of handling is reasonably demonstrated, it is not an abuse of discretion for the trial [court] to admit the evidence in the\r\nabsence of proof of tampering, bad faith, or ill-motive.&quot; (citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (second alteration in original).\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to whether the trial court erred in declining to charge the jury on the lesser-included\r\noffense of simple possession of crack cocaine: State v. Rivera, 389 S.C. 399, 404, 699 S.E.2d 157, 159 (2010) (&quot;The law to be charged must be\r\ndetermined from the evidence presented at trial.&quot; (citations omitted)); State v. Fields, 356 S.C. 517, 523, 589 S.E.2d 792, 795 (Ct. App. 2003)\r\n(&quot;[A] trial judge does not err by refusing to charge a lesser-included offense where there is no evidence tending to show that the defendant was guilty\r\nonly of the lesser offense.&quot; (citations omitted)); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(B) (Supp. 2010) (providing that a person commits PWID crack\r\ncocaine rather than merely simple possession of crack cocaine where the person &quot;possesses with intent to distribute .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. cocaine base\r\n.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;); &nbsp;State v. Franks, 376 S.C. 621, 624, 658 S.E.2d 104, 106 (2008) (&quot;The mere contention that the jury might accept the\r\nState's evidence in part and reject it in part is insufficient to satisfy the requirement that some evidence tend to show the defendant was guilty of only the\r\nlesser offense.&quot; (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J., HUFF and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\npursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-274","title":"State v.

Brackett, of York, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  David Wayne Zitcovich appeals his convictions on five\r\n  counts of indecent exposure, arguing the trial court erred in denying his\r\n  motion to sever the consolidated case.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nIn 2008, Zitcovich was\r\n  indicted on five counts of indecent exposure stemming from a series of\r\n  incidents during the summer of 2007.Â  Five teenage girls accused Zitcovich of\r\n  exposing his genitalia while he was giving them driving lessons.Â  During\r\n  pretrial motions, Zitcovich moved to sever the consolidated case and try each\r\n  of the five cases independently.Â  Following arguments from counsel and a\r\n  hearing, the trial court denied Zitcovich's motion.\r\n&quot;Generally, when\r\n  offenses charged in separate indictments are of the same general nature\r\n  involving connected transactions closely related in kind, place, and character, the trial [court] has the discretion\r\n  to order the indictments tried together, but only so long as the defendant's\r\n  substantive rights are not prejudiced.&quot;Â  State v. Cutro, 365 S.C.\r\n  366, 374, 618 S.E.2d 890, 894 (2005) (citations omitted).\r\nThe trial court did not abuse\r\n  its discretion in denying the motion to sever because the incidents giving rise\r\n  to the five indictments &quot;(1) arose out of a single chain of circumstances,\r\n  (2) are proved by the same evidence, (3) are of the same general nature, and\r\n  (4) no real right of [Zitcovich was] prejudiced.&quot;Â  State v. Tucker,\r\n  324 S.C. 155, 164, 478 S.E.2d 260, 265&nbsp;(1996) (citations omitted).Â  The\r\n  incidents were of the &quot;same general nature involving connected\r\n  transactions closely related in kind, place, and character.&quot; Cutro,\r\n  365 S.C. at 374, 618 S.E.2d at 894 (citations omitted).Â  The incidents occurred\r\n  in the same manner, over the course of several months, to five similarly aged\r\n  and situated victims, while alone with Zitcovich in his car.Â  See State\r\n    v. Grace, 350 S.C. 19, 23-24, 564 S.E.2d 331, 333-34 (Ct. App. 2002)\r\n  (holding consolidation of charges was proper when all the sexual abuse incidents\r\n  occurred between the same parties and took place in the same location over the\r\n  course of several months and the evidence showed a pattern of sexual abuse that\r\n  was essentially the same for all of the charges).\r\nZitcovich's right to a fair\r\n  trial was not jeopardized by trying the cases together.Â  The trial court\r\n  correctly decided that all of the victims' testimony could come in to describe\r\n  Zitcovich's prior bad acts because they showed a common scheme or plan, intent,\r\n  and the absence of mistake.Â  Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â  Because such acts would be\r\n  permitted into evidence regardless of whether the cases were severed, Zitcovich\r\n  would have faced the collective testimony of all five victims in each\r\n  individual trial.Â  See State v. Harry, 321 S.C. 273, 278 n.2, 468\r\n  S.E.2d 76, 79-80 n.2 (Ct. App. 1996) (observing no right of the defendant was\r\n  jeopardized by denial of a severance motion because, even if the motion had\r\n  been granted, much of the evidence of other related crimes would have been\r\n  admissible under Rule 404(b), SCRE).Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err\r\n  in denying Zitcovich's motion to sever the consolidated case.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, WILLIAMS, and\r\n  THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-287","title":"State v.

Harris, d/b/a S.C.\r\n  Corporate Real Estate Service, (Harris) (collectively Respondents) after\r\n  discovering that a residence it purchased had approximately 1,000 square feet less\r\n  than the amount represented in a multiple listing service (MLS).Â  Alpha seeks\r\n  review of the circuit court's order granting summary judgment to Respondents.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nOn June 7, 2005,\r\n  Harris, a real estate broker, entered into an Exclusive Right to Sell Agreement\r\n  with Household concerning one of its foreclosure properties at 6 Rice Mill\r\n  Ferry Road in Richland County.Â  Unbeknownst to Harris, sometime in June 2005,\r\n  Household received a copy of a private appraisal it had commissioned.Â  The\r\n  appraisal indicated that the house contained 3,043 square feet of heated living\r\n  space.Â  Household did not provide a copy of the appraisal to Harris.Â  \r\nHarris advertised\r\n  the property in an MLS listing, which stated that the property contained\r\n  approximately 3,916 heated square feet of living space and the information in\r\n  the listing was &quot;Deemed Reliable, but Not Guaranteed.&quot;Â  Harris had\r\n  obtained the information regarding square footage from the Richland County tax\r\n  assessor's office.Â  The amount indicated was consistent with the square footage\r\n  noted in the 2005 Richland County tax appraisal for the property.Â  \r\nIn November\r\n  2005, Alpha was incorporated for the purpose of renovating and reselling homes.\r\n  Â In January 2006, Alpha entered into a contract of sale for Household's\r\n  property on an &quot;as is where is&quot; basis.Â  The contract included the\r\n  following provision regarding inspection of the property:Â  \r\n\r\n  The\r\n    Listing and Selling Broker(s) recommend that Purchaser obtain a home inspection.Â \r\n    Purchaser has the right within ten (10) business days after acceptance of\r\n    contract, to have home inspected by qualified professional inspectors of his\r\n    choice . . . Purchaser's failure to notify Seller or Seller's Agent in writing\r\n    of any defect found by the home inspection within the time limits herein\r\n    provided, or Purchaser's acceptance of the deed at closing, shall constitute\r\n    Purchaser's full acceptance of the condition of the property and a waiver of\r\n    Purchaser's right to object to any defects found by the home inspection(s).\r\n\r\nThe contract\r\n  also contained the following disclaimers: &quot;The parties acknowledge that\r\n  the Listing and Selling Broker(s) and their Agent(s):Â  (A) Give no warranty of\r\n  any kind, express or implied, as to the physical condition of the property or\r\n  as to [the] condition of or existence of improvements, services or systems\r\n  thereto . . . ; (B) Give no warranty, express or implied, concerning . . . the\r\n  accuracy of the square footage[,] heated or unheated . . . (D) Give no\r\n  warranty, express or implied, as to the fitness for a particular purpose of the\r\n  property or improvements thereto . . . .&quot;Â  An addendum to the contract\r\n  included the following language: &quot;Buyer acknowledges . . . that Buyer has\r\n  been given a reasonable opportunity to inspect and investigate the property and\r\n  all improvements thereon . . . and that in purchasing the property[,] Buyer is\r\n  not relying on Seller, or its agents, as to the condition or safety of the\r\n  property and/or any improvements thereon . . . .&quot;Â  Â Â \r\nAlpha does not\r\n  dispute the fact that it did not measure the home before closing on the\r\n  purchase for $205,000.Â  After purchasing the home, Alpha renovated it and\r\n  placed it on the market.Â  Alpha then commissioned an appraisal of the property,\r\n  which indicated that it had 2,942 square feet of heated living space instead of\r\n  3,916 square feet as indicated by the MLS listing.Â  Alpha later sold the\r\n  property for $280,000.Â  \r\nAlpha then filed\r\n  this action against Respondents, asserting claims for negligence, negligent\r\n  misrepresentation, breach of contract, and breach of implied warranty.Â  The\r\n  circuit court granted Respondents' summary judgment motions, and this appeal\r\n  followed. \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n  1. Did the circuit\r\n    court properly grant summary judgment to Respondents when they were entitled to\r\n    judgment as a matter of law on each of Alpha's claims?\r\n  2. Did the circuit\r\n    court properly grant summary judgment to Respondents without first\r\n    requiring Household to comply with Alpha's discovery requests?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from\r\n  the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard as\r\n  that required for the circuit court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.&nbsp; Brockbank v. Best Capital Corp.,\r\n  341 S.C. 372, 379, 534 S.E.2d 688, 692 (2000).&nbsp; Summary judgment is proper\r\n  when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is\r\n  entitled to judgment as a matter of law.&nbsp; Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Adamson v. Richland Cnty. Sch. Dist. One,\r\n  332 S.C. 121, 124, 503 S.E.2d 752, 753 (Ct. App.&nbsp;1998).&nbsp; &quot;To\r\n  determine if any genuine issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable\r\n  inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.&quot;&nbsp; Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of S.C., 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161,\r\n  165 (2003).Â  Further, &quot;in cases applying the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence burden of proof, the non-moving party is only\r\n  required to submit a mere scintilla of evidence in order to withstand a motion\r\n  for summary judgment.&quot;Â  Hancock\r\n    v. Mid-South Mgmt., Inc., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d\r\n  801, 803&nbsp;(2009). \r\n&quot;The\r\n  purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases [that] do not\r\n  require the services of a fact finder.&quot;Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440,\r\n  452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001). Â &quot;Summary\r\n  judgment is appropriate in those cases in which plain, palpable and\r\n  undisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ.&quot;Â  Priest\r\n    v. Brown, 302 S.C. 405, 408, 396 S.E.2d 638, 639&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1990).Â \r\n  &quot;It is not sufficient that one create an inference [that] is not\r\n  reasonable or an issue of fact that is not genuine.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Once the\r\n  moving party meets the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary\r\n  support for the opponent's case, the opponent cannot simply rest on mere\r\n  allegations or denials contained in the pleadings but must come forward with\r\n  specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.Â  Rule 56(e),\r\n  SCRCP; Boone v. Sunbelt Newspapers, Inc., 347 S.C. 571, 579, 556 S.E.2d 732, 736&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App.&nbsp;2001).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â  Judgment\r\n  as a Matter of Law\r\nAlpha maintains\r\n  that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to Respondents\r\n  because Alpha presented more than a scintilla of evidence showing that\r\n  Respondents grossly misstated the square footage of the house Alpha purchased\r\n  and intentionally withheld information as to the actual square footage.Â  We\r\n  believe the circuit court correctly granted summary judgment to Respondents\r\n  regardless of any evidence of Respondents' intent to withhold information\r\n  because the contract of sale expressly disclaimed any warranty as to the home's\r\n  square footage and because Alpha failed to measure the square footage before closing\r\n  on the purchase.Â  We will address each of Alpha's causes of action in turn.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A.Â Â Negligent\r\n  Misrepresentation\r\nTo\r\n  establish a claim for negligent misrepresentation, a plaintiff must show:Â  \r\n\r\n  (1) the defendant made a false representation to the plaintiff;\r\n    (2) the defendant had a pecuniary interest in\r\n    making the statement; (3) the defendant owed a duty of care to communicate\r\n    truthful information to the plaintiff; (4) the defendant breached that duty;\r\n    (5) the plaintiff justifiably relied on the representation; and (6) the\r\n    plaintiff suffered a pecuniary loss as a result of such reliance.Â  \r\n\r\nSchnellmann\r\n  v. Roettger, 368 S.C. 17, 20-21, 627 S.E.2d 742, 744&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2006), aff'd as modified on other grounds, 373 S.C. 379, 645 S.E.2d\r\n  239&nbsp;(2007).&nbsp; \r\nIn Schnellmann,\r\n  two home purchasers asserted a negligent misrepresentation claim against a real\r\n  estate listing agent based on the discrepancy between the square\r\n  footage indicated in an MLS listing and the actual square footage.Â  Id. at 20, 627 S.E.2d at 744.Â  This court noted:\r\n\r\n  The Schnellmanns could have discovered the misstatement by simply\r\n    requesting a copy of the appraisal or by having someone come in to measure the\r\n    property. They were informed via the MLS listing that the measurements were not\r\n    precise. The Schnellmanns viewed the house, and proceeded with the purchase\r\n    without finally determining the exact square footage. In light of the evidence\r\n    presented, we agree with the trial court's conclusion that if the Schnellmanns\r\n    relied on the approximation of the square footage contained in the listing, such\r\n      reliance was unreasonable as a matter of law.\r\n\r\nId. at\r\n  21, 627 S.E.2d at 745 (emphasis added).\r\n  \r\n\r\nLike the\r\n  purchasers in Schnellmann, Alpha failed to take its own\r\n  measurements of the home's square footage.Â  Therefore, Alpha's reliance on the\r\n  square footage indicated in the MLS listing was unreasonable as a matter of\r\n  law.Â  Alpha cannot obtain compensation from Respondents if it has not exercised\r\n  its own due diligence.Â  See Schnellmann, id. at\r\n  21, 627 S.E.2d at 745 (&quot;[T]here can be no liability for casual statements,\r\n  representations as to matters of law, or matters which plaintiff could\r\n  ascertain on his own in the exercise of due diligence.&quot;) (citation and internal\r\n  quotation marks omitted).Â  \r\nAlpha argues\r\n  that the determination of the right to rely on a defendant's representation\r\n  necessarily requires weighing the evidence of whether the representation was\r\n  material and intentional or insubstantial and inadvertent.Â  However, Alpha\r\n  cites no authority for this proposition.Â  Therefore, Alpha has abandoned this\r\n  argument.Â  See Rule\r\n  208(b)(1)(D), SCACR (requiring the citation of authority in the argument portion of an appellant's brief); First\r\n    Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (noting that when a party fails to cite authority or when\r\n  the argument is simply a conclusory statement, the party is deemed to have\r\n  abandoned the issue on appeal).\r\nAlpha\r\n  cites the following language from section 40-57-137(F) of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (2011) in support of its argument that the evidence of Respondents' intent\r\n  precluded summary judgment:Â  \r\n\r\n  A seller's agent, the company, and the broker-in-charge are not\r\n    liable to a buyer for providing the buyer with false or misleading\r\n    information if that information was provided to the licensee by his\r\n    client and the licensee did not know or have reasonable cause to suspect the\r\n    information was false or incomplete.\r\n    \r\n    (emphasis added).[1]Â \r\n    Admittedly, this statute creates a duty of care on the part of a real estate\r\n    broker toward a purchaser to avoid burying his head in the sand with regard to\r\n    the condition of the property.[2]Â \r\n    This would establish the third element of the negligent misrepresentation\r\n    claim.Â  However, section 40-57-137(F) does not suggest that a plaintiff has\r\n    established all of the elements of a negligent misrepresentation claim if\r\n    the plaintiff merely presents evidence that the broker had reasonable cause to\r\n    suspect information provided to him by his client was false or incomplete.Â  The\r\n    language in subsection (G) of the statute lends support to this conservative\r\n    interpretation of subsection (F): &quot;Nothing in this chapter limits the\r\n    obligation of the buyer to inspect the physical condition of the property which\r\n    the buyer may purchase.&quot;[3] Â \r\n\r\nHere, Alpha relied\r\n  on an MLS listing that expressly stated that the information was not\r\n  guaranteed.Â  Further, the parties' contract expressly disclaimed any warranty\r\n  as to square footage.Â  Alpha, therefore, cannot show even a scintilla of\r\n  evidence as to the fourth element of the negligent misrepresentation claimâ€”a\r\n  breach of the duty of care.Â  \r\nMoreover, Alpha\r\n  failed to take its own measurements of the home, and, thus, its reliance on the\r\n  MLS listing was unreasonable as a matter of law.Â  This precluded showing even a\r\n  scintilla of evidence on the justifiable reliance element, the fifth element,\r\n  of its negligent misrepresentation claim.Â  Â Â \r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, Respondents\r\n  were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Alpha's negligent\r\n  misrepresentation claim.Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â  B. Negligence\r\nAlpha's\r\n  negligence claim and its negligent misrepresentation claim should have been\r\n  treated as solely one claim for negligent misrepresentation.Â  See Rule 220(c),\r\n  SCACR (stating that this court may affirm the circuit court's ruling upon\r\n  any ground appearing in the record); Quail Hill, L.L.C. v. Cnty.\r\n    of Richland, 387 S.C. 223, 240, 692 S.E.2d 499, 508&nbsp;(2010)&nbsp;(holding\r\n  that a plaintiff's negligence claim against a county for its employee's mistake\r\n  in advising the plaintiff's agent regarding a zoning classification was\r\n  subsumed in its negligent misrepresentation claim); id. (&quot;We agree\r\n  with County that Quail Hill's claims of negligence and negligent misrepresentation should be treated as solely\r\n  one for negligent misrepresentation.&quot;).Â  Because Respondents were entitled to\r\n  judgment as a matter of law on Alpha's negligent misrepresentation claim, they\r\n  were likewise entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Alpha's negligence\r\n  claim.\r\nEven if we were\r\n  to examine the negligence claim independently, Respondents were entitled to\r\n  judgment as a matter of law on this claim because they expressly disclaimed any\r\n  warranty as to square footage and thus did not breach any duty to give truthful\r\n  information to Alpha.Â Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â  C.Â Breach\r\n  of Contract\r\nAlpha's\r\n  complaint states that Respondents' representation regarding square footage\r\n  constituted a condition of the contract of sale.Â  The complaint further states\r\n  that despite this condition, the house contained only approximately 75% of the\r\n  stated square footage, and, therefore, Respondents breached the contract of\r\n  sale.\r\nWhen the terms\r\n  of a contract\r\n  are clear, the interpretation of the contract is a question of law for the\r\n  court.Â  Stribling v. Stribling, 369 S.C. 400, 404, 632 S.E.2d 291, 293&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2006).Â \r\n  Here, the contract of sale has no provision stating the amount of the home's square\r\n  footage.Â  In fact, it has a provision clearly stating that the listing and\r\n  selling brokers give no warranty concerning the accuracy of the square footage.Â \r\n  Further, the\r\n  parties' contract included an integration clause,\r\n  stating &quot;[t]he parties agree that this written contract expresses the\r\n  entire agreement between the parties, and that there is no other agreement,\r\n  oral or otherwise, modifying the terms hereunder . . . .&quot;Â  Thus, the\r\n  square footage representation in the MLS listing is not a part of the contract.Â  See Gilliland v. Elmwood Props., 301 S.C. 295, 302, 391 S.E.2d\r\n  577, 581&nbsp;(1990) (&quot;The parol evidence rule prevents the introduction\r\n  of extrinsic evidence of agreements or understandings contemporaneous with or\r\n  prior to execution of a written instrument when the extrinsic evidence is to be\r\n  used to contradict, vary, or explain the written instrument.&quot;); id. (&quot;This is especially true when the written instrument contains a merger or\r\n  integration clause.&quot;).\r\nBecause\r\n  the alleged breach is not based on any provision in the parties' contract, Respondents were\r\n  entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Alpha's breach of contract claim.\r\nD.Â  Breach of Implied\r\n  Warranty\r\nAlpha's\r\n  complaint states that Respondents' representation regarding square footage\r\n  constituted an implied warranty that the house would be fit for its intended\r\n  use and the normal expectations of a purchaser.Â  The complaint further states\r\n  &quot;[d]espite such implied warranty of fitness and habitability, the\r\n  Plaintiff's home was not as represented and actually contained only\r\n  approximately 75% of the . . . heated living area represented.&quot;\r\nHere,\r\n  Alpha conceded in its complaint that it purchased a used home from\r\n  Respondents.Â  &quot;[N]o warranty attaches to sales of used homes.&quot;Â  Arvai v.\r\n    Shaw, 289 S.C. 161, 164, 345 S.E.2d 715, 717&nbsp;(1986).Â  Further, the\r\n  contract of sale expressly disclaimed any warranties as to the accuracy of\r\n  square footage, the property's physical condition, or its fitness for a\r\n  particular purpose.Â  \r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, Respondents\r\n  were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Alpha's breach of implied\r\n  warranty claim.Â  \r\nII.Â  Discovery\r\nFinally, Alpha\r\n  asserts that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to Respondents\r\n  without first requiring Household to comply with Alpha's discovery requests.Â  We disagree. \r\n&quot;A\r\n  complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the non-moving\r\n  party's case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial.&quot;Â  Gauld\r\n    v. O'Shaugnessy Realty Co., 380 S.C. 548, 559, 671 S.E.2d 79,\r\n  85&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2008)&nbsp;(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).Â  Therefore,\r\n  &quot;the nonmoving party must demonstrate the likelihood that further\r\n  discovery will uncover additional relevant evidence and that the party\r\n  is not merely engaged in a fishing expedition.&quot;Â  Dawkins\r\n    v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 439&nbsp;(2003) (citations\r\n  and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  the facts relevant to Alpha's claims are undisputed and are clearly reflected\r\n  in the record.Â  Alpha closed on the sale of a used home without first measuring\r\n  the home's heated square footage, despite the disclaimer in the MLS listing and\r\n  despite the provisions of the contract disclaiming the accuracy of the square\r\n  footage or any warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.Â  Therefore,\r\n  further discovery will not uncover additional relevant evidence, as\r\n  required by Dawkins.Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the circuit court properly granted summary judgment to\r\n  Respondents despite the fact that discovery had not yet been completed.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  judgment of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, KONDUROS,\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.Â  Â Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Subsection\r\n  (F) also states: &quot;A licensee who represents a seller shall treat all prospective\r\n  buyers honestly and may not knowingly give them false or misleading information\r\n  about the condition of the property which is known to the licensee or, when\r\n  acting in a reasonable manner, should have been known to the licensee.&quot;Â \r\n  The &quot;condition of the property&quot; includes square footage.Â  \r\n[2] See Rayfield\r\n  v. S.C. Dep't of Corr., 297 S.C. 95, 103, 374 S.E.2d 910, 914&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App.&nbsp;1988) (&quot;In order to show that the defendant owes him a duty of care\r\n  arising from a statute, the plaintiff must show two things: (1) that the\r\n  essential purpose of the statute is to protect from the kind of harm the\r\n  plaintiff has suffered; and (2) that he is a member of the class of persons the\r\n  statute is intended to protect.&quot;); id. (&quot;If\r\n  the plaintiff makes this showing, he has proven the first element of a claim\r\n  for negligence: viz., that the defendant owes him a duty of care.&quot;).\r\n[3] Also noteworthy\r\n  is subsection (Q) of the statute, which states that the\r\n  provisions of section 40-57-137 that are inconsistent with common law supersede\r\n  common law and the common law may be used to aid in interpreting or clarifying\r\n  the duties described in the statute.Â  The court's opinion in Schnellmann is\r\n  consistent with section 40-57-137 and clarifies the scope of the buyer's duty\r\n  to inspect to include measuring square footage.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-290","title":"State v.

Lee Process Systems Co., this court vacated a\r\n  trial court's grant of summary judgment and remanded the case to the trial\r\n  court for more specific findings and analysis because the trial court's &quot;fail[ure]\r\n  to articulate the reasons for its action on the record or enter a written order\r\n  outlining its rationale .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot; prevented this court from\r\n  sufficiently reviewing whether summary judgment was appropriate.Â  Id. at\r\n  235-36, 241, 536 S.E.2d at 88, 91.Â  \r\nHere, we cannot determine\r\n  whether summary judgment was appropriate because the trial court's order fails\r\n  to articulate its reasons for granting summary judgment.Â  However, we do not\r\n  vacate and remand this case because the trial court might have articulated its\r\n  decision during the summary judgment hearing and the Woodsons failed to provide\r\n  a hearing transcript.Â  Because the Woodsons failed to satisfy their burden of\r\n  providing a sufficient record, therefore, we affirm the appeal.Â  See Rule 210(h), SCACR (&quot;[T]he appellate court will not consider any fact\r\n  which does not appear in the Record on Appeal.&quot;); Price v.

Peace, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Thomas B. Cheeks, Jr. appeals his\r\n  conviction for statutory escape. Â On\r\n  appeal, Cheeks contends the\r\n  trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Cheeks argues the State failed to prove the elements of statutory escape\r\n  because he was in the process of being arrested and not in confinement.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\n&quot;When ruling on a motion\r\n  for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence or\r\n  nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.&quot;Â  State v. Weston, 367\r\n  S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006).Â  When reviewing a denial of a\r\n  directed verdict, an appellate court views the evidence and all reasonable\r\n  inferences in the light most favorable to the State.Â  Id.Â  If any direct\r\n  evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tends to prove the\r\n  guilt of the accused, the appellate court must find the case was properly\r\n  submitted to the jury.Â  Id. at 292-93, 625 S.E.2d at 648.\r\nUnder section 24-13-410 of the South Carolina Code (2007),\r\n  &quot;[i]t is unlawful for a person, lawfully confined in prison or upon the\r\n  public works of a county or while in the custody of a\r\n  superintendent, guard, or officer, to escape . . . .&quot; Â (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  A definition of &quot;custody&quot; is &quot;detention of a person by\r\n  virtue of lawful process or authority.&quot; Â Black's Law Dictionary 442\r\n  (9th ed. 2009).\r\nIn Bing v. Harvey, the\r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court held that an &quot;appellant's escape from lawful\r\n  pretrial custody violated the statutory offense of escape.&quot; Â 274 S.C. 216,\r\n  217-18, 262 S.E.2d 42, 43 (1980) (noting initially that &quot;[a]ppellant\r\n  escaped from the lawful pretrial custody&quot; of the Sherriff and then stating\r\n  that there was &quot;no question&quot; that &quot;appellant was 'being lawfully\r\n  confined' at the time of his escape,&quot; the court allowed an inference that\r\n  a person in lawful pretrial custody is lawfully confined).Â  \r\nThe State presented\r\n  sufficient evidence to meet the elements of the escape statute.Â  Cheeks\r\n  stipulated he was lawfully arrested.Â  The State produced evidence that an\r\n  officer arrested Cheeks for a traffic violation, handcuffed him, and\r\n  transferred him to another officer's custody. Â The second officer\r\n  transported Cheeks to the police department for booking and placement in jail.Â \r\n  At the police department, the officer removed Cheeks's handcuffs to complete\r\n  the booking process.Â  Cheeks ran out the door of the building and was\r\n  apprehended by the officer, after a foot chase, in the field across the\r\n  building.Â  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the\r\n  evidence supported submitting the case to the jury.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT,\r\n  KONDUROS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-299","title":"Town of Prosperity v.

Smith, of Pawleys Island, and Robert L. Widener, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Several\r\n  purchasers of condominiums (the Appellants) in the Bahama Sands Horizontal\r\n  Property Regime (the Development) appeal the order of the master-in-equity\r\n  denying their motion to stay.Â  We\r\n  dismiss[1] this appeal as not immediately\r\n  appealable.\r\nThis appeal arises from a\r\n  foreclosure action brought by Service Corporation of South Carolina, which held\r\n  a mortgage interest in the Development, against the developer.Â  At the time the\r\n  action was brought, several breach of contract actions, filed by Appellants,\r\n  were pending against the developer.Â  Because of these pending claims, the\r\n  developer filed a third-party complaint against the Appellants, seeking\r\n  indemnification and a determination of priority of interests in the Development.\r\n  Â Appellants in turn reasserted their breach of contract claims against the\r\n  developer, as well as Service Corporation.Â  The circuit court then severed the\r\n  foreclosure claim from the breach of contract claims and referred the\r\n  foreclosure action to the master for a final determination.\r\nAppellants moved to stay the\r\n  foreclosure hearing pending a jury trial in the circuit court on the severed\r\n  breach of contract claims.Â  They argued they were entitled to a finding by a\r\n  jury on facts common to both the legal and equitable claims.Â  Finding no\r\n  disputed common facts, the master denied the motion, and a foreclosure hearing\r\n  was scheduled.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nThe jurisdiction of this\r\n  court to hear interlocutory appeals is limited by statute to certain\r\n  circumstances.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330 (Supp. 2010).Â  Because a motion to\r\n  stay is interlocutory, we must determine, as a threshold matter, whether the\r\n  circumstances of this appeal fall within the categories prescribed by section\r\n  14-3-330.Â  Based on the reasoning of Edwards v. SunCom, 369 S.C. 91, 631\r\n  S.E.2d 529 (2006), we find they do not.\r\n&quot;Absent some specialized\r\n  statute, the immediate appealability of an interlocutory or immediate order\r\n  depends on whether the order falls within [section] 14-3-330.&quot;Â  Id. at 93, 631 S.E.2d at 530.Â  Applying section 14-3-330 to an appeal of a ruling\r\n  on a motion to stay, our supreme court in Edwards identified the\r\n  relevant analysis to be whether the order &quot;involve[d] the merits, affect[ed]\r\n  a substantial right, or prevent[ed] a judgment from which an appeal may later\r\n  be taken.&quot;Â  Id. at 94, 631 S.E.2d at 530.Â  It reasoned &quot;[a]n order which involves the merits is one that must finally\r\n  determine some substantial matter forming the whole or a part of some cause of\r\n  action or defense.&quot;Â  Id. (citation and internal quotation\r\n  marks omitted). Â Moreover, it defined an order &quot;affecting\r\n  a substantial right&quot; as one that &quot;discontinued an action [or] prevent[ed]\r\n  an appeal.&quot;Â  Id. (citation and internal quotation marks\r\n  omitted).Â  Finding that the order, which granted a\r\n  motion to stay, did not discontinue the proceeding, the supreme court held\r\n  &quot;an order granting a stay is not immediately appealable.&quot;Â  Id. at 95, 631 S.E.2d at 531.\r\nHere, the order\r\n  denying Appellants' motion to stay did not involve the merits, affect a\r\n  substantial right, or prevent a judgment from which an appeal may later be\r\n  taken.Â  Therefore, we hold Appellants' appeal is not immediately appealable.\r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED.\r\nFEW, C.J., PIEPER and\r\n  LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-301","title":"Asmussen v.

Bannister, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n        H. Michael Spivey, of Mauldin, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Linda\r\n  Asmussen (Wife) appeals from the family court's final divorce decree, arguing\r\n  the court erred in (1) using Patrick Asmussen's (Husband's) contributions plus\r\n  interest as the value of a defined benefit pension plan, and (2) not awarding\r\n  her attorney's fees and costs.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife\r\n  were married in 1992 in Iowa, and no children were born of the marriage.Â  In\r\n  2007, Husband and Wife separated, and Wife moved to South Carolina.Â  Husband\r\n  testified he moved to South Carolina two months after Wife moved to reconcile\r\n  with Wife based on her request.Â  Wife testified she moved to be closer to her\r\n  brother, and she did not want Husband to move to South Carolina.\r\nIn 2008, Wife\r\n  filed a complaint in the Greenville County Family Court, seeking separate support\r\n  and maintenance, equitable division of marital assets and debts, and attorney's\r\n  fees and costs.Â  Husband filed an answer and counterclaimed for separate\r\n  support and maintenance, equitable division of the marital property, alimony,\r\n  and attorney's fees and costs.\r\nAt the final\r\n  hearing on April 9, 2009, Wife moved to amend to seek a divorce on one-year's\r\n  continuous separation.Â  Husband did not object, and the court granted the\r\n  motion.Â  Husband and Wife agreed they had divided all personal property and\r\n  each would keep the property in his or her possession.Â  Husband also withdrew\r\n  his claim for alimony.Â  At the end of the hearing, Husband and Wife stipulated\r\n  that: (1) they would equally divide the marital estate; and (2) the court would\r\n  determine the present value of Husband's Iowa Retirement Plan.Â  Wife's expert\r\n  testified that, using the life expectancy method of calculation, the value of\r\n  Husband's retirement plan was $76,901.46 at the time of the hearing; however,\r\n  Husband testified he called the Iowa Retirement Plan immediately before the\r\n  hearing, and his retirement was valued at $31,000, including contributions and\r\n  interest.[2]Â \r\n  On cross-examination, Wife's expert admitted Husband's cash surrender value, as\r\n  of July 4, 2008, would have been a little less than $31,888.71.Â  Also, he\r\n  admitted that as of the date of the hearing, the only amount Husband could have\r\n  withdrawn from the plan was the cash surrender value.Â  The court found it\r\n  noteworthy that Husband's retirement was negatively impacted by Wife's desire\r\n  to move to South Carolina; his relocation to South Carolina; and her decision\r\n  to seek a divorce.Â  \r\nThe family court\r\n  filed its final divorce decree on June 24, 2009.Â  In the decree, the court made the following rulings: (1) Wife was entitled to a divorce on one-year's separation;\r\n  (2) Husband and Wife were to keep all personal property currently in his or her\r\n  possession; (3) all other marital assets were to be divided as provided in the\r\n  order; (4) Husband's Iowa retirement account's present value was to be\r\n  determined by the contributions plus interest method, resulting in a value of\r\n  $31,000; (5) Husband and Wife were responsible for his or her own attorney's\r\n  fees and costs; (6) Wife was to pay Husband $294.67 within 30 days of the\r\n  filing of the order for half of the difference in distributions; and (7)\r\n  Husband was responsible for the preparation of any qualified domestic relations\r\n  orders necessary to effect distribution.Â  Wife filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP,\r\n  motion, which was denied by the court.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family\r\n  court, this court reviews factual and legal issues de novo. Â Simmons v.\r\n    Simmons, Op. No. 26970 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 9, 2011) (Shearouse Adv.\r\n  Sh. No. 16 at 29); see Lewis v. Lewis, Op. No. 26973 (S.C. Sup.\r\n  Ct. filed May 9, 2011) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 16 at 44). Â Although this court\r\n  reviews the family court's findings de novo, we are not required to ignore the\r\n  fact that the trial court, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better\r\n  position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their\r\n  testimony.Â  Lewis, Op. 26973 at 46-48.Â  The burden is upon the appellant\r\n  to convince this court that the family court erred in its findings.Â  Id. at 49-51.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Pension Plan\r\nWife argues the family court erred in using Husband's\r\n  contributions plus interest to determine the value of his defined benefit\r\n  pension plan.Â  We disagree.\r\nWife asserts this is error\r\n  because it ignores the additional value the plans have to the holder.Â  Wife\r\n  asserts the use of only contributions to value a pension plan was specifically\r\n  rejected in Smith v. Smith, 308 S.C. 372, 418 S.E.2d 314 (Ct. App.\r\n  1991).Â  Wife also claims that in Belton v. Belton, 325 S.C. 456, 461, 481\r\n  S.E.2d 174, 174 (Ct. App. 1997), the court reiterated that defined benefit\r\n  pension plans are calculated using actuarial evidence to arrive at the present\r\n  cash value.Â  Thus, Wife requests we reverse the family court's determination of\r\n  the value of Husband's retirement account; find the plan's present day value\r\n  was $76,901.46; and remand the issue to the family court for an adjustment\r\n  based on our finding.\r\nThe family court found the\r\n  retirement plan in this case differed from those in Martin v. Martin,\r\n  296 S.C. 436, 373 S.E.2d 706 (Ct. App. 1988), and Smith because, unlike\r\n  here, benefits were being paid at the time of the litigation.Â  The court stated\r\n  there were two common methods the court could use to value Husband's retirement\r\n  plan: (1) the distribution from each payment method; and (2) the method of\r\n  determining present value.Â  The court determined the distribution from each\r\n  payment method was not appropriate under the facts of the case, and the parties\r\n  agreed.Â  Thus, the court found the plan's present value could be determined by\r\n  either contributions plus interest, or by a calculation using actuarial\r\n  evidence and other factors.Â  The court concluded there is no set rule for\r\n  determining present cash value, and each case must be individually analyzed based\r\n  on its facts.Â  The court also noted courts are &quot;encouraged to award the\r\n  plan to the employee spouse where, as here, there are sufficient other marital\r\n  assets to allow for an offset.&quot;Â  Therefore, the court found the present\r\n  value of Husband's retirement plan to be $31,000, as reflected by contributions\r\n  plus interest.\r\n&quot;[T]he [South Carolina] Code\r\n  does not specifically define pension benefits as marital property, but this [c]ourt\r\n  has consistently held that both vested and nonvested retirement benefits are\r\n  marital property if the benefits are acquired during the marriage and before\r\n  the date of filing.&quot;Â  Shorb v. Shorb, 372 S.C. 623, 629, 643 S.E.2d\r\n  124, 127 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  &quot;Even if the vested benefits have yet to\r\n  mature, they are properly includable in the marital estate.&quot;Â  Id. at 630, 643 S.E.2d at 128.Â  In Tiffault v. Tiffault, 303 S.C. 391, 393,\r\n  401 S.E.2d 157, 158 (1991), our supreme court determined that vested retirement\r\n  benefits accrued during the marriage constituted an earned property right that is\r\n  subject to equitable distribution.Â  In Ball v. Ball, 314 S.C. 445, 447,\r\n  445 S.E.2d 449, 450 (1994), our supreme court agreed with the Tiffault court and found nonvested pension plans are also marital property.Â  The court\r\n  determined &quot;[i]t is within the discretion of the [f]amily court to\r\n  determine, from the facts of each case, what portion, if any, of the benefits\r\n  spouse is entitled to receive.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The court further found\r\n  &quot;the pension plan essentially has no value until vestment,&quot; and\r\n  &quot;a finding of no current value is sufficient&quot; because &quot;the court\r\n  must only determine the portion of the plan to which the spouse is entitled.&quot;Â  Id. at 447-48, 445 S.E.2d at 450-51.Â Â  \r\nIn Martin, the husband\r\n  had already begun receiving pension benefits at the time of the divorce\r\n  hearing.Â  Id. at 439, 373 S.E.2d at 708.Â  The wife presented expert\r\n  testimony concerning the value of the husband's retirement plan.Â  Id.Â \r\n  The expert based his computation on the following assumptions: (1) a\r\n  twenty-seven year life expectancy for the husband under the mortality tables;\r\n  (2) a constant real income stream of $735 per month; and (3) a discount rate of\r\n  1.1% based on the average real rate of return on long-term government bonds.Â  Id.Â \r\n  The husband's expert witness gave no opinion on the value of the retirement\r\n  account because he thought it was too speculative to value.Â  Id.Â  The\r\n  court used the wife's expert's computation and an offset approach in the final\r\n  distribution of the marital property.Â  Id. at 439-40, 373 S.E.2d at\r\n  708.Â  On appeal, the husband argued the court erred in using the present cash\r\n  value method to value and distribute his pension.[3]Â  Id. at 440, 373 S.E.2d at 709.Â  In rejecting his argument, this court\r\n  determined &quot;there were sufficient other marital assets to permit an\r\n  application of an offset without working an inequity on the husband.&quot;Â  Id. at 441, 373 S.E.2d at 709.Â  This court further stated &quot;[t]he trial court\r\n  has wide discretion in determining equitable distribution of marital property\r\n  and its judgment will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The court found no abuse of discretion in the\r\n  family court's use of the present cash value method, but &quot;emphasize[d]\r\n  there is no set rule in this area and each case must be analyzed and determined\r\n  on its own facts.&quot;Â  Id.Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn Smith, the husband\r\n  had already received a lump sum of his retirement benefits and was receiving\r\n  monthly benefits at the time of the divorce hearing.Â  308 S.C. at 373, 418\r\n  S.E.2d at 315.Â  Based on that and other facts, this court determined the trial\r\n  court erred in valuing the husband's pension.Â  Id. at 374, 418 S.E.2d at\r\n  316.Â  The Smith court stated that to evaluate the present cash value of\r\n  a pension, the testimony of an actuary is essential.Â  Id.Â  Because the\r\n  court did not have any actuarial evidence of record, the court adopted the\r\n  distribution from each payment method of valuation.Â  Id.\r\nIn Belton, the family\r\n  court valued the husband's three pension plans at $15,000, using the present\r\n  cash value method.Â  325 S.C. at 460-61, 481 S.E.2d at 176.Â  On appeal, the wife\r\n  argued this was error because the only evidence presented was that the accounts\r\n  were valued at $42,854.25.Â  Id.Â  The evidence presented to the family\r\n  court included: (1) the wife's expert accountant's testimony; (2) a letter from\r\n  the husband's employer; (3) the husband's financial statement; and (4) each\r\n  party's general testimony.Â  Id. at 461, 481 S.E.2d at 176.Â  This court\r\n  noted the two methods for valuing pensions, present cash value and distribution\r\n  from each payment, have both pros and cons.Â  Id.Â  The court stated the\r\n  present cash value method &quot;promotes finality and the severance of the\r\n  entanglements between the parties, but its downside can be difficulty in\r\n  valuation.&quot;Â  Id.Â  It also stated &quot;[t]here is no set rule for\r\n  how to determine present cash value.&quot;Â  Id. at 461, 481 S.E.2d at\r\n  177.Â  The court quoted Martin, holding that courts typically use\r\n  actuarial evidence to calculate the present cash value of a defined benefit\r\n  plan.Â  Id.Â  This court concluded the family court erred in its valuation\r\n  of the husband's plan because the evidence presented did not support the\r\n  court's amount.Â  Id. at 462, 481 S.E.2d at 177. Â Specifically, the\r\n  husband's financial declaration failed to include anything that actually\r\n  quantified the present value of his plans; the letter from the husband's\r\n  employer listed the current value of husband's two defined contribution plans\r\n  at $6,603.00, but it did not provide the current value of the husband's defined\r\n  benefit plan; and neither the husband's nor the wife's testimony provided any\r\n  specific dollar amount for the values of the three plans.Â  Id.Â  Thus,\r\n  the court remanded the case to the family court to use $42,854.25 as the\r\n  corrected value of the husband's plans, to determine what percent was marital\r\n  property, and to divide the assets accordingly.Â  Id. at 463, 481 S.E.2d\r\n  at 178.Â Â Â Â  \r\nBased on our review of the\r\n  relevant case law and the evidence presented, we find the evidence supports the\r\n  family court's determination that Husband's retirement was valued at $31,000 at the time of the divorce\r\n  hearing.Â  Although Wife's expert testified he calculated the value of Husband's\r\n  retirement plan to be $76,901.46, Husband testified his retirement plan was\r\n  valued at $31,000 immediately before the hearing.Â  Further, on\r\n  cross-examination, Wife's expert admitted that as of the hearing, the only\r\n  amount Husband could have gotten from his plan was the cash surrender value,\r\n  which would probably have been a little less than $31,888.71.Â  We do not find any error in the family court's use of the present\r\n  cash value method.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Attorney's Fees and Costs\r\nWife argues the family court\r\n  erred in not awarding her attorney's fees and costs.Â  We need not address this\r\n  issue.\r\nWife asserts that Husband\r\n  rejected her offer to divide his plan; thus, she had to have his plan valued by\r\n  an expert at a cost of $1,106.25.Â  Wife asserts that we should award her\r\n  attorney's fees and costs if we reverse the family court's determination of the\r\n  value of Husband's pension plan.Â  However, we need not address this issue because we do not find any\r\n  error in the family court's determination\r\n  of the value of Husband's pension plan.Â  See Futch v. McAllister\r\n    Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999)\r\n  (holding an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its\r\n  determination of another issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the family court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, SHORT\r\n  and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n[2]Â  Wife's expert testified Husband's plan is a defined\r\n  benefit plan, and Husband did not object.Â  Wife's expert calculated the value\r\n  of Husband's plan using the following assumptions: (1) a four percent discount\r\n  rate; (2) a benefit rate of twenty-four percent; (3) retirement at age\r\n  fifty-five; and (4) a life expectancy of 77.39 years. \r\n[3]Â  The court described this method:Â  &quot;The trial\r\n  court calculates, using actuarial evidence, the present value of the pension.Â \r\n  The court further calculates the percentage of the present value attributable\r\n  to the marriage and the appropriate equitable share of the other spouse.Â \r\n  Usually, the pension is awarded to the employee spouse and there is an offset\r\n  of other marital property to the nonemployee spouse.&quot;Â  Id. at 440\r\n  n.2, 373 S.E.2d at 709 n.2.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-302","title":"Black v, Cayia","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayUnPubOpinion.cfm?caseNo=2011-UP-302","description":null,"date":"2011-06-17","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n\t\t<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nP.heading {\r\ntext-align:center\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS OPINION HAS NO\r\n  PRECEDENTIAL VALUE.Â  IT SHOULD NOT BE CITED OR RELIED ON AS PRECEDENT IN ANY\r\n  PROCEEDING EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY RULE 268(d)(2), SCACR.\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        William Black\r\n          and Debbie Black, Appellants,\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nv.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Danielle P.\r\n          Cayia, Deborah Davis Cayia, Michael R.

Darby Plexico, III, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: William\r\n  Black and Debbie Black[1] (the Blacks) appeal from the trial court's order granting summary judgment to\r\n  Michael Knox and Tung Van Dao (collectively, Respondents).Â  The Blacks argue\r\n  the court erred in granting summary judgment to Knox because there was evidence\r\n  his negligence was not limited to his speeding.Â  We affirm.[2]\r\nFACTS\r\nWilliam Black was\r\n  a passenger in a vehicle driven by Respondent Knox and owned by Respondent\r\n  Dao.Â  The vehicle driven by Knox was involved in an accident with a vehicle\r\n  driven by Danielle Cayia and owned by Deborah Cayia.Â  The Blacks filed a\r\n  complaint against both drivers and owners, alleging the individual and joint\r\n  negligence of both drivers caused the collision.Â  Black testified in his\r\n  deposition that Knox was driving as fast as 45 miles per hour on a four-lane\r\n  road with a 35 mile per hour speed limit.Â  Cayia was stopped in the median and\r\n  waiting to make a left turn.Â  The cars in the left on-coming lane had stopped\r\n  or were slowing down to let Cayia make her left turn.Â  Knox, who was traveling\r\n  in the left lane, changed lanes to the right lane, possibly to avoid the\r\n  stopped or slowed cars in the left lane.Â  The cars in the left lane obscured\r\n  Knox's vision of Cayia's vehicle in the median, and Cayia's vision of Knox's\r\n  vehicle in the right lane.Â  Knox's and Cayia's cars collided when Cayia was\r\n  making her turn, crossing the path of Knox's vehicle.Â  Cayia's vehicle had only\r\n  made it about two feet into the right lane where Knox's car was traveling when\r\n  the accident happened.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nRespondents moved\r\n  for summary judgment on the basis that Knox's speeding was not the proximate\r\n  cause of the accident.Â  A hearing was held on February 6, 2009.Â  The only\r\n  depositions taken at the time of the hearing were the depositions of William\r\n  Black and Danielle Cayia.Â  On May 5, 2009, the court granted summary judgment\r\n  to Respondents.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing\r\n  the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same\r\n  standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP, which provides\r\n  summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material\r\n  fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule\r\n  56(c), SCRCP; see Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d\r\n  857, 860 (2002).Â  On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the\r\n  appellate court reviews all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in\r\n  and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.Â  Willis v. Wu, 362 S.C. 146, 151, 607 S.E.2d 63, 65 (2004).Â  \r\nSummary judgment should only\r\n  be granted when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the\r\n  moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Hedgepath v. Am.\r\n    Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 348 S.C. 340, 354, 559 S.E.2d 327, 335 (Ct. App.\r\n  2001).Â  &quot;Summary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into\r\n  the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the\r\n  law.&quot;Â  Id. at 355, 559 S.E.2d at 335.Â  &quot;However, when plain,\r\n  palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ,\r\n  summary judgment should be granted.&quot;Â  Id. at 355, 559 S.E.2d at\r\n  336.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Blacks argue\r\n  the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Respondents because the\r\n  evidence of Knox's negligence was not limited to his speeding.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\n  \r\nTo succeed in a\r\n  negligence cause of action, a plaintiff must establish: (1) the defendant owed\r\n  a duty of care to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant breached the duty by a\r\n  negligent act or omission; (3) the defendant's breach was the actual and\r\n  proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury; and (4) the plaintiff suffered an\r\n  injury or damages.Â  Burnett v. Family Kingdom, Inc., 387 S.C. 183, 189,\r\n  691 S.E.2d 170, 173 (Ct. App. 2010).Â  &quot;Negligence is not actionable unless\r\n  it proximately causes the plaintiff's injuries.&quot;Â  Bailey v. Segars,\r\n  346 S.C. 359, 366, 550 S.E.2d 910, 914 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  &quot;A negligent act\r\n  or omission proximately causes an injury if, in a natural and continuous\r\n  sequence of events, it produces the injury, and without it, the injury would\r\n  not have occurred.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;Ordinarily, the question of\r\n  proximate cause is one of fact for the jury.&quot;Â  Id. at 367, 550\r\n  S.E.2d at 914.Â  &quot;The trial court's sole function regarding the issue is to\r\n  determine whether particular conclusions are the only reasonable inferences\r\n  that can be drawn from the evidence.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;Only in rare or\r\n  exceptional cases may the issue of proximate cause be decided as a matter of\r\n  law.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  \r\nIn Horton v.\r\n  Greyhound Corp., 241 S.C. 430, 128 S.E.2d 776 (1962), our supreme court\r\n  held the trial court properly directed a verdict for the defendants because the\r\n  plaintiff had failed to produce evidence of a causal connection between the\r\n  speed of the bus and the fatal collision.Â  The court noted it was &quot;clear\r\n  that the only evidence of a negligent or unlawful act by the bus driver relates\r\n  to excessive speed, which could not have resulted in harm to [the plaintiff] if\r\n  the truck had remained in its proper lane of travel.&quot;Â  Id. at\r\n  438-39, 128 S.E.2d at 781.Â  &quot;The concurrence of excessive speed with this\r\n  primary, efficient cause of the collision does not impose liability on the\r\n  defendants unless, without it, the collision would not have occurred.&quot;Â  Id. at 439, 128 S.E.2d at 781.Â  &quot;That speed was a contributing factor in\r\n  placing the bus at a particular location on the highway when the emergency\r\n  arose is without legal significance, because the defendants had the legal right\r\n  to occupy that portion of the highway.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The court found\r\n  &quot;[t]his is simply one of those rare cases in which the evidence, although\r\n  sufficient to support an inference of concurrent negligence by the defendants,\r\n  is insufficient to support a reasonable inference that without such negligence\r\n  the collision would not have occurred.&quot;Â  Id. at 441, 128 S.E.2d at\r\n  782.Â  The court rested its conclusion on &quot;the absence of evidence\r\n  sufficient to raise a reasonable inference that it would not have occurred but\r\n  for the negligence of the bus driver, which amounts to a failure of proof of an\r\n  essential element of plaintiff's cause of action.&quot;Â  Id.Â Â Â Â Â \r\n  \r\nThe Blacks maintain\r\n  the court erred in relying on Horton because they assert Horton does not apply when the evidence of negligence is not limited to just\r\n  speeding.Â  They argue this court narrowed Horton and its progeny in Davis\r\n  v. Tripp, 338 S.C. 226, 235-36, 525 S.E.2d 528, 533 (Ct. App. 1999), in\r\n  which the court held a court cannot, as a matter of law, find no liability\r\n  &quot;when there is evidence of additional negligence or that speed was a\r\n  causative factor.&quot;Â  The Blacks assert the evidence presented showed Knox\r\n  failed to slow down or keep a better lookout: (1) in light of the other traffic\r\n  on the roadway; (2) in light of the entrances to commercial establishments on\r\n  both sides of the roadway; (3) in light of his inability to see what was in the\r\n  median; and (4) as he approached from the right lane several cars that were\r\n  stopped or slowing in the left lane.Â  They also maintain there was evidence\r\n  from which a jury could reasonably infer that Knox made an illegal lane\r\n  change.Â  Therefore, the Blacks contend there was &quot;evidence [Knox] was\r\n  speeding through a heavily traveled commercial roadway under circumstances\r\n  where it was reasonable to conclude that traffic was stopped (or slowing) in front\r\n  of him to allow another vehicle to make a left turn across his lane of\r\n  travel&quot; and &quot;[i]t should be left to the jury to decide whether the\r\n  evidence of his negligence . . . warrants the imposition of liability for the\r\n  collision.&quot;Â \r\n  \r\nIn Davis v.\r\n  Tripp, the case relied upon by the Blacks, the appellants appealed the\r\n  trial court's refusal to give a jury instruction in accordance with Horton.Â \r\n  338 S.C. at 234, 525 S.E.2d at 532.Â  In finding the trial court did not err in\r\n  refusing to give the jury charge, this court noted a court cannot find there\r\n  was no liability as a matter of law when there is evidence of additional\r\n  negligence or that speed was a causative factor.Â  Id. at 235-36, 525\r\n  S.E.2d at 533.Â  However, unlike the case at hand, Davis presented evidence that\r\n  the defendant was not keeping a proper lookout in addition to speeding.Â \r\n  Specifically, the defendant admitted he: (1) was speeding; (2) saw plaintiff's\r\n  truck in the median; (3) acknowledged a car there created the possibility of a\r\n  problem; (4) did not reduce his speed or move to the right lane; (5) made a\r\n  comment to his passenger that plaintiff needed to pull out in front of him\r\n  because he needed a new car; and (6) could have pulled into the grassy median\r\n  when he saw plaintiff pull out in front of him, but he did not because he\r\n  thought he would &quot;roll&quot; the car.Â  Id. at 236-37, 525 S.E.2d at\r\n  533.\r\n  \r\nThe Blacks also\r\n  cite to Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 529 S.E.2d 528 (2000), and Tubbs\r\n  v. Bowie, 308 S.C. 155, 417 S.E.2d 550 (1992); however, we find these cases\r\n  distinguishable from the case at hand because, unlike here, speed was found to\r\n  be a proximate cause of the accident.Â  In Clark, our supreme court\r\n  determined the trial court properly refused to give a jury charge on speeding\r\n  and proximate cause in accordance with Horton because the plaintiff\r\n  presented evidence that the accident probably would not have occurred if the\r\n  defendant had not been speeding.Â  339 S.C. at 390, 529 S.E.2d at 539.Â  The\r\n  court noted that a judge may grant a litigant's directed verdict motion under Horton when &quot;it is without legal significance that speed was a contributing\r\n  factor in a collision, and the record contains no evidence of other negligent\r\n  or wrongful acts by the speeding driver.&quot;Â  Id. at 391, 529 S.E.2d\r\n  at 540.Â  In Tubbs, our supreme court held the trial court properly\r\n  denied the defendant's motion for directed verdict because there was evidence\r\n  that the defendant failed to take appropriate action upon seeing the truck\r\n  enter the highway; thus, the evidence did not show that the accident was\r\n  inevitable, irrespective of the defendant's speed.Â  308 S.C. at 157-58, 417\r\n  S.E.2d at 552.Â  The Blacks also cite to Umhoefer v. Bollinger, 298 S.C.\r\n  221, 379 S.E.2d 296 (Ct. App. 1989); however, we find it is distinguishable\r\n  because there was more evidence of the defendant's negligence than presented in\r\n  this case.Â  In Umhoefer, this court found the trial court properly\r\n  denied the defendant's motion for directed verdict because there was evidence\r\n  that just prior to the accident, the defendant was speeding, was weaving in and\r\n  out of traffic, failed to yield the right of way, and entered the intersection\r\n  on a red light; thus, a jury question existed as to whether the defendant's\r\n  negligence was the proximate cause of the accident.Â  298 S.C. at 224, 379\r\n  S.E.2d at 297.\r\n  \r\n  In addition to relying on Horton,\r\n    the trial court cited many of the cases decided pursuant to Horton, in\r\n    which the courts found speed was not a proximate or concurrent cause of the\r\n    accident.Â  Most similarly to this case, in Alston v. Blue Ridge Transfer Co.,\r\n    308 S.C. 292, 296, 417 S.E.2d 631, 633-34 (Ct. App. 1992), this court affirmed\r\n    the trial court's grant of summary judgment for the defendant because the\r\n    defendant's speed was not the proximate cause of the accident when the defendant\r\n    and the plaintiff were proceeding in opposite directions and the defendant hit\r\n    a patch of ice, causing his vehicle to cross over the center line.Â  Also, in Guyton\r\n      v. Guyton, 244 S.C. 357, 361-62, 137 S.E.2d 273, 275 (1964), our supreme\r\n    court affirmed a directed verdict for the defendant, whose vehicle collided\r\n    with a dark-colored mule that darted into the roadway directly in front of the\r\n    vehicle at night, because the defendant's speeding could not, as a matter of\r\n    law, have caused the accident.Â  In Kennedy v. Carter, 249 S.C. 168, 178,\r\n    153 S.E.2d 312, 317 (1967), our supreme court reversed the denial of a directed\r\n    verdict for the defendant, who swerved off the road to avoid an oncoming\r\n    drunken driver, because the defendant's speeding could not, as a matter of law,\r\n    have caused the accident, and the defendant's speeding would not have resulted\r\n    in harm to the plaintiff if the drunken driver had remained in his proper lane\r\n    of travel.Â  In Roumillat v. Keller, 252 S.C. 512, 516, 167 S.E.2d 425,\r\n    428 (1969), our supreme court found the defendant's speeding was not the\r\n    proximate cause of the first collision, in which an oncoming vehicle crossed\r\n    the median and struck his vehicle.Â  In Odom v. Steigerwald, 260 S.C.\r\n    422, 426-27, 196 S.E.2d 635, 637 (1973), our supreme court reversed the denial\r\n    of the plaintiff's motion for directed verdict on liability because, as a\r\n    matter of law, any speeding by the plaintiff could not have caused the accident\r\n    where evidence showed the defendant's vehicle pulled directly into plaintiff's\r\n    path.Â  In Blanding v. Hammell, 267 S.C. 352, 356-57, 228 S.E.2d 271,\r\n    272-73 (1976), our supreme court affirmed the directed verdict for the\r\n    defendant because the testimony showed the plaintiff pulled directly in front\r\n    of the defendant and the defendant's slight speeding could not, as a matter of\r\n    law, have caused the accident.Â  \r\n  Addressing the failure to\r\n    keep proper lookout, in Gunnels v. Roach, 243 S.C. 248, 252, 133 S.E.2d\r\n    757, 759-60 (1963), our supreme court reversed the denial of a directed verdict\r\n    where the defendant hit an eight-year-old boy who had run from between two cars\r\n    parked diagonally at a curb because there was undisputed evidence that the\r\n    defendant did not see the boy, and he could not have been seen by a motorist\r\n    exercising due care.Â  &quot;In [these] rare cases . . . where speed has not\r\n    been a causative factor, the court has focused on the inevitability of the\r\n    accident, irrespective of the defendant's speed, due to an unexpected entry of\r\n    the plaintiff into the defendant's right of way.&quot;Â  Blanding, 267\r\n    S.C. at 357, 228 S.E.2d at 272-73.Â  \r\nWhen viewed in the\r\n  light most favorable to the Blacks, we find there is no evidence for the jury\r\n  to have found that the accident would not have occurred &quot;but for&quot;\r\n  Knox's alleged speeding, alleged failure to keep a proper lookout, or alleged\r\n  illegal lane change.Â  The Blacks assert there was evidence from which the jury could\r\n  reasonably infer that Knox made an illegal lane change; however, the Blacks did\r\n  not make this specific argument at the hearing on the motion for summary\r\n  judgment, and the judge did not address the argument in his order.Â  In addition,\r\n  the Blacks did not file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion.Â  Therefore, we find this\r\n  issue is not preserved for our review.Â  See Chastain v. Hiltabidle,\r\n  381 S.C. 508, 515, 673 S.E.2d 826, 829 (Ct. App. 2009) (holding when an issue\r\n  is raised to, but not ruled upon by the trial court, the issue is preserved for\r\n  appeal only if the party raises the same issue in a Rule 59(e) motion).Â  Even\r\n  if the issue was preserved, we find the evidence presented does not support the\r\n  argument.Â  Black testified Knox changed lanes, but it was a normal maneuver and\r\n  was not to avoid anything in the road.Â  Furthermore, Black said Knox's vehicle\r\n  was completely in the right lane at the time of impact.Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n  \r\n  Regarding the Blacks'\r\n    argument that Knox failed to keep a proper lookout, William Black testified\r\n    that Knox was paying attention to the road and was not distracted in any way\r\n    before the accident.Â  Black said he and Knox were not talking, the radio was\r\n    not loud, they were not in a rush, and Knox was not talking on a cell phone.Â \r\n    Black also testified the vehicle in the left lane was a large SUV, and it\r\n    blocked their view of Cayia's car, so he did not know if Knox could have\r\n    avoided the accident.Â  Black even testified that Cayia pulled out in front of\r\n    Knox.Â  Cayia's testimony does not establish Knox was negligent because she did\r\n    not see Knox's vehicle prior to the accident.Â  Cayia testified she could see\r\n    oncoming traffic in the right lane, and she waited to turn when she thought the\r\n    road was clear.Â  Cayia admitted she was talking on her cell phone when the\r\n    accident occurred.Â  Additionally, Cayia said she failed to yield the right of\r\n    way, and she admitted she was at least partially at fault for the accident.Â  \r\nThe only evidence\r\n  presented that Knox may have been speeding was Black's testimony that he\r\n  estimated Knox may have been traveling 5 to 10 miles per hour above the speed\r\n  limit when the accident occurred.Â  However, Black admitted he did not know for\r\n  certain because he could not see the speedometer.Â  Black also said he was\r\n  uncertain whether Knox's speed factored into causing the accident because he\r\n  was not paying attention when the accident occurred.Â  Cayia testified she could\r\n  not estimate Knox's speed because did not see his vehicle before the accident.\r\n  \r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  evidence shows the accident would have occurred regardless of whether Knox was\r\n  speeding, and Knox's speeding would not have harmed Black if Cayia had not\r\n  turned in front of Knox's vehicle.Â  Therefore, because the Blacks failed to\r\n  produce any evidence that Knox's alleged speeding or failure to keep a proper\r\n  lookout was the proximate cause of the accident, we find the trial court\r\n  properly granted summary judgment to Respondents.\r\n  \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  Accordingly, the trial\r\n    court's grant of summary judgment to Respondents is\r\n  AFFIRMED.\r\n  HUFF, SHORT and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  William Black was a minor at the time of the car\r\n  accident.Â  Thus, Debbie Black, his mother, was named as a co-defendant in the\r\n  action because of her responsibility for his medical expenses and the loss of\r\n  her child's services from his injuries.\r\n[2]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-303","title":"State v, McKnight","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayUnPubOpinion.cfm?caseNo=2011-UP-303","description":null,"date":"2011-06-17","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n\t\t<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nP.heading {\r\ntext-align:center\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS OPINION HAS NO\r\n  PRECEDENTIAL VALUE.Â  IT SHOULD NOT BE CITED OR RELIED ON AS PRECEDENT IN ANY\r\n  PROCEEDING EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY RULE 268(d)(2), SCACR.\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        The State, Respondent,\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nv.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Herman Donald McKnight, Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Florence County\r\nThomas A.

Clements, III, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Herman McKnight appeals from his\r\n  convictions for murder, assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature\r\n  (ABHAN), discharging a firearm into a dwelling, and possession of a firearm\r\n  during a crime of violence.Â  He argues the trial court erred in refusing to\r\n  instruct the jury on involuntary manslaughter.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn August 22, 2007,\r\n  after Donna Floyd's wake, McKnight and his family gathered at the home Donna\r\n  had lived in with her mother, Alice.Â  Donna was McKnight's daughter, and when Alice\r\n  was sick with cancer, McKnight testified he asked Donna to live with them.[2]Â \r\n  McKnight often stayed at the home, but he also owned his own trailer where he\r\n  stayed on occasion.Â  Linda McKnight, McKnight's eldest daughter, testified that\r\n  she, along with Donna and their younger sister, Kathy, owned the house.[3]Â \r\n  Linda was also living in the home at the time of the incident.Â  Additionally, Donna's\r\n  son, Jay Floyd, lived in the home, and on occasion, Donna's husband,[4] Stewart Floyd, stayed there as well. \r\nMcKnight wanted to\r\n  drink a beer; however, Stewart objected to McKnight drinking in the home.Â \r\n  Sharon Floyd, a relative by marriage, testified McKnight said, &quot;let's get the\r\n  party going,&quot; meaning &quot;he wanted to drink.&quot;Â  Sharon testified\r\n  Stewart said, &quot;I love you, . . . but we're not going to have that here\r\n  tonight, tonight is not the night for that.&quot;Â  Jeanette Floyd, Stewart's\r\n  mother, testified Stewart told McKnight, &quot;I don't mean anything by this,\r\n  but we don't feel up to any drinking and partying going on here tonight, and\r\n  I'd like for you to leave.&quot;Â  Jeanette's husband, Lilton, said Stewart\r\n  responded, &quot;I don't mean no harm about it, I wish you . . . would go ahead\r\n  and leave 'cause a wake is no place to be drinking.&quot;Â  Stewart angered\r\n  McKnight by telling him what he could do in the home, so McKnight threatened\r\n  Stewart and went to his vehicle to get his gun.Â  Sharon recalled that McKnight\r\n  said he was going to get his gun and kill Stewart, and he went out the door.Â \r\n  Jeanette recollected that McKnight began cursing, looked at Stewart, pointed\r\n  his finger, and said, &quot;I'm going to kill your son of a bitching\r\n  ass.&quot;Â  Lilton heard him say, &quot;I'm gonna [sic] to kill you, you son of\r\n  a bitch.&quot;Â  Donna's sister, Linda McKnight, testified she heard McKnight\r\n  &quot;threatened to blow [Stewart's] brains out&quot; before running out the\r\n  back door.Â  She feared McKnight was going to get a gun, so she went to the\r\n  bathroom and called 911.Â  Mary Lee, the sister to a friend of McKnight's,\r\n  testified she warned her brother, Joe Clark, to stop McKnight because she\r\n  thought he was going to get a gun, and he appeared angry. \r\nWhen McKnight returned\r\n  with the gun, someone had locked the first back door, but McKnight kicked it\r\n  in.Â  Jeanette grabbed the doorknob to the second back door and told McKnight he\r\n  could not come in the home.Â  She testified he replied, &quot;the hell I\r\n  won't&quot; and &quot;reared the gun back and he shot through the door,&quot;\r\n  hitting Jeanette's hand and arm.Â  Jeanette also heard Stewart cry out, and he\r\n  &quot;folded over . . . in his wheelchair.&quot;Â  She said she heard McKnight\r\n  then say he was &quot;going to kill the rest of these son of bitches.&quot;Â \r\n  Lilton testified when he got to the room, McKnight had shot Stewart and was\r\n  standing over him &quot;fixing to shoot him again.&quot;Â  Lilton's grandson,\r\n  Ian Kinney, testified he saw McKnight &quot;turn and stick the gun right at\r\n  [Stewart's] side . . . [a]bout six to eight inches away,&quot; and shoot\r\n  Stewart.Â  Another grandson of Lilton's, Nikki Kinney, testified he saw McKnight\r\n  shoot Stewart.Â  Sharon and Linda testified they heard two gunshots, screaming,\r\n  and chaos.Â  Lilton and Ian fought with McKnight to get the gun from him.Â \r\n  Stewart later died from his gunshot wounds. \r\nDeputy Rollins Rhodes\r\n  was the first to respond to the 911 call for help, and he found Stewart laying\r\n  on his right side with a hole in his left side.Â  He recovered the sawed-off\r\n  shotgun, observed the broken chairs, broken glass, and blood, and noted\r\n  Jeanette's injuries.Â  Rhonda Morris, a responding EMT, testified Stewart was\r\n  not breathing when she arrived, and although she detected some electrical\r\n  activity from his heart, his heart was not beating.Â  Dr. Susan Presnell, a\r\n  forensic pathologist, testified Stewart died of a &quot;close range shotgun\r\n  wound . . . to his left side,&quot; and he also had wounds indicative of pellet\r\n  marks hitting his body from further away.\r\nIn his defense,\r\n  McKnight admitted he was angry and threatened Stewart; left the house to get\r\n  his shotgun from his truck; kicked open one door and shot open another; entered\r\n  the kitchen; pumped the shotgun; and took the gun over to Stewart.Â  However, he\r\n  claimed he was not going to kill Stewart and simply wanted to scare him, but\r\n  Stewart grabbed for the gun, causing it to discharge accidentally.Â  McKnight\r\n  recalled Linda to the stand, and she testified McKnight and Stewart &quot;got\r\n  along well&quot; and did not have any &quot;problems or issues.&quot;Â  On\r\n  cross-examination, however, she stated she was afraid McKnight was going to\r\n  kill Stewart that night.\r\nThe Florence County Grand\r\n  Jury indicted McKnight for murder, assault and battery with intent to kill\r\n  (ABWIK), discharging a firearm into a dwelling, and possession of a firearm\r\n  during a crime of violence.Â  A trial was held June 25 to 27, 2008.Â  The jury\r\n  found McKnight guilty as charged, with the exception of McKnight's charge for\r\n  ABWIK, for which the jury found him guilty of the lesser offense of ABHAN.Â  The\r\n  court sentenced him to life imprisonment for murder, and concurrent sentences\r\n  of ten years imprisonment for ABHAN and discharging a firearm into a dwelling.[5]Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nÂ In criminal\r\n  cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only and is bound by\r\n  the trial court's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State\r\n    v. Bryant, 372 S.C. 305, 312, 642 S.E.2d 582, 586 (2007).Â  Thus, on review,\r\n  the appellate court is limited to determining whether the trial court abused its\r\n  discretion.Â  Id. Â An abuse of discretion occurs when the court's\r\n  decision is unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.Â  State\r\n    v. Garrett, 350 S.C. 613, 619, 567 S.E.2d 523, 526 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMcKnight argues the trial\r\n  court erred in refusing to\r\n  instruct the jury on involuntary manslaughter.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trial court's duty is to\r\n  give a requested instruction that correctly states the law applicable to the\r\n  issues and is supported by the evidence.Â  State v. Lee-Grigg, 374 S.C.\r\n  388, 405, 649 S.E.2d 41, 50 (Ct. App. 2007). Â In determining whether the\r\n  evidence requires a charge on involuntary manslaughter, this court must view\r\n  the facts in the light most favorable to the defendant.Â  State v. Childers,\r\n  373 S.C. 367, 373, 645 S.E.2d 233, 236 (2007).Â  &quot;A request to charge a\r\n  lesser included offense is properly refused only when there is no evidence that\r\n  the defendant committed the lesser rather than the greater offense.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Brayboy, 387 S.C. 174, 180, 691 S.E.2d 482, 485 (Ct. App. 2010).Â  The court's\r\n  refusal to give a requested jury charge must be both erroneous and prejudicial\r\n  to the defendant to warrant reversal.Â  Lee-Grigg, 374 S.C. at 415, 649\r\n  S.E.2d at 55.\r\n&quot;Involuntary\r\n  manslaughter is: (1) the unintentional killing of another without malice, but\r\n  while engaged in an unlawful activity not amounting to a felony and not\r\n  naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm; or (2) the unintentional\r\n  killing of another without malice, while engaged in a lawful activity with\r\n  reckless disregard for the safety of others.&quot;Â  State v. Smith, 391 S.C.\r\n  408, 414, 706 S.E.2d 12, 15 (2011).Â  &quot;To constitute involuntary\r\n  manslaughter, there must be a finding of criminal negligence, statutorily\r\n  defined as a reckless disregard of the safety of others.&quot;Â  State v.\r\n    Crosby, 355 S.C. 47, 52, 584 S.E.2d 110, 112 (2003).Â  &quot;Recklessness is\r\n  a state of mind in which the actor is aware of his or her conduct, yet\r\n  consciously disregards a risk which his or her conduct is creating.&quot; Â State\r\n    v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 571, 647 S.E.2d 144, 167 (2007).Â  &quot;[A] person\r\n  can be acting lawfully, even if he is in unlawful possession of a weapon, if he\r\n  was entitled to arm himself in self-defense at the time of the shooting.&quot; Â Crosby,\r\n  355 S.C. at 52, 584 S.E.2d at 112.Â  &quot;The negligent handling of a loaded\r\n  gun will support a charge of involuntary manslaughter.&quot;Â  State v.\r\n    Mekler, 379 S.C. 12, 15, 664 S.E.2d 477, 478 (2008).Â  &quot;Additionally,\r\n  evidence of a struggle over a weapon between a defendant and victim supports\r\n  submission of an involuntary manslaughter charge.&quot;Â  Brayboy, 387 S.C.\r\n  at 180, 691 S.E.2d at 485.\r\nAt the conclusion of the\r\n  trial, McKnight requested charges on both voluntary and involuntary\r\n  manslaughter.Â  McKnight argued he was entitled to the charge on involuntary\r\n  manslaughter because there was evidence McKnight believed he had some ownership\r\n  in the home and discharging a weapon in your home does not offend the statute\r\n  against discharging a firearm into a dwelling,[6] there was evidence McKnight was reckless in his actions, and the struggle over\r\n  the weapon supported the charge.Â  McKnight cited to Casey v. State, 305\r\n  S.C. 445, 447, 409 S.E.2d 391, 392 (1991), in which the court held\r\n  &quot;[e]vidence of a struggle between a defendant and a victim over a weapon\r\n  is sufficient for submission of an involuntary manslaughter instruction to the\r\n  jury.&quot;Â  The State responded that McKnight was engaged in an unlawful act,\r\n  the felony of pointing and presenting a firearm;[7] therefore, he was not entitled to a charge of involuntary manslaughter.Â  See State v. Reese, 370 S.C. 31, 36, 633 S.E.2d 898, 901 (2006), overruled\r\n    on other grounds by State v. Belcher, 385 S.C. 597, 685 S.E.2d 802\r\n  (2009) (noting it is a felony for a person to present or point at another\r\n  person a loaded or unloaded firearm, and &quot;there is no doubt that\r\n  [appellant] was presenting a firearm when he took the gun out and began waiving\r\n  [sic] it around. Therefore, [appellant] was pointing or presenting a firearm, a\r\n  felony, which would preclude an involuntary manslaughter charge.&quot;).Â  The\r\n  judge noted McKnight's request, but declined to charge involuntary\r\n  manslaughter, instead charging voluntary manslaughter and accident.\r\nOn appeal, McKnight argues\r\n  the court erred by refusing to charge the jury on involuntary manslaughter\r\n  because there was evidence Stewart grabbed the gun, and it went off\r\n  accidentally.Â  He asserts that evidence of a struggle over a gun is sufficient\r\n  for the submission of an involuntary manslaughter instruction.Â  He also asserts\r\n  there was evidence that his threat against Stewart was not taken seriously, and\r\n  he only shot at the doorknob to open the locked door.Â  McKnight asserts he had\r\n  a right to be in the house, he recklessly used the gun to shoot open the door,\r\n  and he recklessly handled the gun so that it discharged when Stewart tried to\r\n  grab the gun; therefore, he was entitled to an involuntary manslaughter charge.\r\nMcKnight cites to State v.\r\n  Light, 378 S.C. 641, 664 S.E.2d 465 (2008), in support of his argument.[8] Â In Light, the court found Light was entitled to an instruction on\r\n  involuntary manslaughter despite &quot;inconsistent stories&quot; because there\r\n  was evidence that Light was lawfully armed in self-defense at the time of the\r\n  shooting.Â  378 S.C. at 648, 664 S.E.2d at 468-69.Â  Light testified he took the\r\n  gun from his girlfriend who was threatening him, and because the gun discharged\r\n  almost immediately after he took possession of it, the court found there was\r\n  evidence he recklessly handled the gun.Â  Id. at 648, 664 S.E.2d at 469.Â \r\n  The Light court noted &quot;the negligent handling of a loaded gun will\r\n  support a finding of involuntary manslaughter&quot; and &quot;the fact\r\n  petitioner and [the victim] were struggling over the weapon is sufficient\r\n  evidence to support an involuntary manslaughter charge to the jury.&quot;Â  Id. at 648-49, 664 S.E.2d at 469.\r\nIn Crosby, 355 S.C. at\r\n  52-53, 584 S.E.2d at 112, Crosby claimed he was trying to break up a fight when\r\n  the decedent charged at him, so he removed a gun from his pocket in\r\n  self-defense and pulled the trigger without realizing it.Â  Our supreme court\r\n  determined Crosby was entitled to an involuntary manslaughter instruction\r\n  because there was evidence from which the jury could infer that he did not\r\n  intentionally shoot the gun.Â  Id. at 52-53, 584 S.E.2d at 112-13. Â In Mekler,\r\n  379 S.C. at 16, 664 S.E.2d at 479, Mekler was arguing with the decedent and pulled\r\n  out her gun for self-defense.Â  As she was holding the gun, it discharged\r\n  accidentally, hitting the decedent.Â  Id.Â  Our supreme court found she\r\n  was entitled to an instruction on involuntary manslaughter because there was\r\n  evidence she was reckless in the handling of the gun.Â  Id.Â  Also, in State\r\n    v. Brayboy, this court found there was evidence the victim pulled out the\r\n  gun, the defendant struggled with the victim to obtain the gun, and in the\r\n  moments after the defendant obtained possession of the gun, the weapon\r\n  discharged; thus, evidence existed from which the jury could determine Brayboy\r\n  was lawfully armed in self-defense, and he negligently handled the loaded gun\r\n  causing it to discharge.Â  387 S.C. at 182, 691 S.E.2d at 486.Â  Therefore, the\r\n  court found evidence existed to support a charge on involuntary manslaughter.Â  Id. at 182, 691 S.E.2d at 487.\r\nHowever, in State v.\r\n  Brayboy, this court noted our supreme court's decision in Light &quot;makes\r\n  it clear the question is not whether one is acting in self-defense at the time\r\n  of the shooting, but whether the defendant is lawfully armed at the time of the\r\n  shooting.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Shortly after Brayboy, in State v. Gibson,\r\n  this court determined the trial court had properly denied instructing the jury\r\n  on involuntary manslaughter because, by the appellant's own admission, he had\r\n  voluntarily and intentionally fired his weapon.Â  State v. Gibson, 390\r\n  S.C. 347, 358, 701 S.E.2d 766, 772 (Ct. App. 2010).Â  The court stated that\r\n  &quot;regardless of whether [one is] lawfully armed in self-defense, the\r\n  essence of involuntary manslaughter is the involuntary nature of the\r\n  killing.&quot;Â  Id. at 357, 701 S.E.2d at 771.Â  \r\nSimilarly, in State v.\r\n  Cabrera-Pena, 361 S.C. 372, 381, 605 S.E.2d 522, 526 (2004), the supreme\r\n  court found Cabrera-Pena was not entitled to a charge on involuntary\r\n  manslaughter because: \r\n\r\n  Cabrera-Pena's\r\n    conduct â€“ leaving Alma at Applebee's and purchasing a handgun; loading the\r\n    handgun; returning to the Applebee's parking lot to wait for Alma to exit the\r\n    restaurant; calling her over to his van after she exited the restaurant;\r\n    showing Alma the gun and then walking her back over to the truck where the\r\n    friends were standing, prompting Alma to motion to them that he had a gun; and\r\n    finally, shooting her in the eye, killing her â€“ is not the type of conduct\r\n    contemplated under either definition of involuntary manslaughter.Â  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  court explained:\r\n\r\n  Cabrera-Pena's\r\n    conduct does not fit within the first definition of involuntary manslaughter\r\n    because he was engaged in unlawful, felonious and harmful conduct.Â  At minimum,\r\n    he used the loaded pistol to intimidate Alma and forcefully walk her over to\r\n    the pickup truck where her friends were. Â This conduct may be considered\r\n    felonious under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-410 (1976) (pointing or presenting a\r\n    firearm) . . . . Cabrera-Pena's conduct also does not fit within the penumbra\r\n    of the second definition of involuntary manslaughter. Â Cabrera-Pena was acting\r\n    unlawfully when he took advantage of the unfair and extremely dangerous\r\n    situation that he created by bringing a loaded, deadly weapon into a domestic\r\n    dispute in a public place.Â  Moreover, this is not a type of involuntary\r\n    manslaughter case where &quot;a person can be acting lawfully, even if he is in\r\n    unlawful possession of a weapon, if he was entitled to arm himself in self\r\n    defense at the time of the shooting.&quot;Â  Cabrera-Pena presented no evidence\r\n    that he was acting in self-defense.\r\n\r\nId. at 381-82, 605 S.E.2d at 526-27 (internal citations\r\n  omitted).Â  Cabrera-Pena claimed Alma grabbed the gun from him, causing it to\r\n  fire.Â  Id. at 375, 605 S.E.2d at 523.Â  The majority rejected the\r\n  dissent's argument that mere evidence of negligent handling of a loaded gun will\r\n  support a charge of involuntary manslaughter.Â  Id. at 382, 605 S.E.2d at\r\n  527.Â  The court concluded:Â Â  \r\n\r\n  It is\r\n    patent that Cabrera-Pena's conduct in arming himself with a deadly weapon, to\r\n    lay in wait for his wife, so that he could confront her, was not a lawful activity\r\n    and, indeed, created a highly volatile and incendiary domestic situation that\r\n    resulted in Alma's death.Â  Therefore, Cabrera-Pena was not entitled to an\r\n    involuntary manslaughter charge.\r\n\r\nId. at 383-84, 605 S.E.2d at 528 (internal citation\r\n  omitted).\r\nMost recently, in Smith,\r\n  391 S.C. at 414, 706 S.E.2d at 15, our supreme court determined Smith was not\r\n  entitled to an instruction on involuntary manslaughter because &quot;there is\r\n  no evidence to suggest that Smith was without fault in bringing on the\r\n  difficulty, that he believed or actually was in imminent danger of losing his\r\n  life or sustaining serious bodily injury, or that he 'had no other probable\r\n  means of avoiding the danger' other than drawing the loaded weapon.&quot;Â  \r\nViewing the evidence in the\r\n  light most favorable to McKnight, we find the facts do not support a charge of involuntary\r\n  manslaughter. Â McKnight admitted he was angry; told Stewart he was going to\r\n  kill him; exited the house; returned with a gun; kicked open one door and shot\r\n  open another door; and aimed the gun at Stewart, who was wheelchair-bound.Â \r\n  McKnight was convicted of discharging a firearm into a dwelling, a felony, and he\r\n  did not argue that pointing a gun at Stewart was a lawful act.Â  McKnight\r\n  testified he believed Stewart was frightened and thought McKnight intended to\r\n  kill him.Â  The forensic pathologist testified that in addition to dying from a\r\n  close range shotgun wound to his left side, Stewart also had wounds indicative\r\n  of pellet marks hitting his body from further away.Â  Jeanette testified she\r\n  heard Stewart cry out when McKnight shot through the door.Â  Additionally, there\r\n  was no evidence that McKnight was acting in self-defense or that he acted recklessly\r\n  in his handling of the gun.Â  In fact, McKnight's testimony was that Stewart grabbed\r\n  for the gun and caused it to fire.Â  Therefore, because by McKnight's own\r\n  admission he voluntarily and intentionally fired his gun to shoot open the door\r\n  and then aimed the gun at Stewart, we find the court did not err in denying\r\n  McKnight's request to charge the jury on involuntary manslaughter.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the trial court's rulings are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, SHORT\r\n  and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n[2] Alice passed away before Donna, and Donna was still\r\n  living in the home at the time of her own death.\r\n[3]Â  Linda testified Alice owned the house, and when Alice\r\n  died, she and her sisters inherited the house.\r\n[4]Â  Although they were not legally divorced, Donna and\r\n  Stewart no longer lived together as husband and wife, in part due to an\r\n  accident that left Stewart partially paralyzed and wheelchair-bound.\r\n[5]Â  The sentence for McKnight's remaining conviction for\r\n  possession of a firearm during a crime of violence was subsumed in the sentence\r\n  for murder pursuant to section 16-23-490(A) of the South Carolina Code, which\r\n  provides: &quot;This five-year sentence does not apply in cases where the death\r\n  penalty or a life sentence without parole is imposed for the violent\r\n  crime.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-490(A) (2003).\r\n[6]Â  Section 16-23-440(A) of the South Carolina Code\r\n  provides:Â  &quot;It is unlawful for a person to discharge or cause to be\r\n  discharged unlawfully firearms at or into a dwelling house, other building,\r\n  structure, or enclosure regularly occupied by persons.Â  A person who violates\r\n  the provisions of this subsection is guilty of a felony and, upon conviction,\r\n  must be fined not more than one thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than\r\n  ten years, or both.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-440(A) (2003).\r\n[7]Â  We note that McKnight was charged with and found\r\n  guilty of discharging a firearm into a dwelling, not pointing and presenting a\r\n  firearm; however, we find this distinction to be inconsequential because both\r\n  crimes are felonies.Â Â Â  Section 16-23-410 of the South Carolina Code provides:\r\n  &quot;It is unlawful for a person to present or point at another person a\r\n  loaded or unloaded firearm.Â  A person who violates the provisions of this\r\n  section is guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, must be fined in the\r\n  discretion of the court or imprisoned not more than five years.&quot;Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-410 (2003).\r\n[8] McKnight acknowledges that most involuntary\r\n  manslaughter cases that involve a gun discharging arise in the context of\r\n  criminal negligence while a person is allegedly acting in self-defense.Â  McKnight\r\n  did not request a charge on self-defense.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-304","title":"State v.

(Consolidated).Â  Consolidated originally sought Hamlettâ€™s\r\n  ejectment because it wanted to build new corporate headquarters on the\r\n  property.Â  Hamlett argues the circuit court erred in (1) permitting Consolidated\r\n  to renew a previously denied motion for a temporary injunction; (2) granting\r\n  the temporary injunction upon insufficient evidence; (3) failing to hold a jury trial for the temporary injunction; (4) failing\r\n  to provide an accurate hearing transcript; (5) depriving him of due process by considering\r\n  affidavits and exhibits not filed with the renewed motion; (6) advocating on\r\n  behalf of Consolidated; and (7) orchestrating an unconstitutional taking of his\r\n  rights to the property.Â  We reverse.[1]\r\n&quot;The grant of an\r\n  injunction is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be\r\n  reversed absent an abuse of that discretion.&quot;Â  AJG Holdings, LLC v.\r\n    Dunn, 382 S.C. 43, 49, 674 S.E.2d 505, 507 (Ct.

Â Moreover, an adequate remedy\r\n  at law exists because Consolidated could be awarded a monetary judgment against\r\n  Hamlett if Consolidated's suit is successful.\r\nBecause we reverse on the\r\n  above issue, we need not address the remaining issues.Â  See Futch v.\r\n    McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591,\r\n  598 (1999) (stating an appellate court need not address remaining issues when a\r\n  decision on a prior issue is dispositive).\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHUFF,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-309","title":"State v.

We affirm.[1]\r\n1.&nbsp; We find the ALC did not err in\r\n  finding the Department's disciplinary proceedings did not violate Mason's due\r\n  process rights.Â  The Department complied with the minimum due process\r\n  requirements for prison disciplinary proceedings.Â  See Al-Shabazz v.\r\n    State, 338 S.C. 354, 371, 527 S.E.2d 742, 751&nbsp;(2000) (noting in order\r\n  to comply with procedural due process for inmate disciplinary proceedings, the\r\n  following constitutional rights are required: &quot;(1) that advance written\r\n  notice of the charge be given to the inmate . . . ; (2) that fact finders must\r\n  prepare a written statement of the evidence relied on and reasons for the\r\n  disciplinary action; (3) that the inmate should be allowed to call witnesses\r\n  and present documentary evidence, provided there is no undue hazard to\r\n  institutional safety or correctional goals; (4) that counsel substitute . . .\r\n  should be allowed to help illiterate inmates or in complex cases . . . ; and\r\n  (5) that the persons hearing the matter . . . must be impartial&quot; (citing Wolff\r\n    v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 563-72 (1974))). \r\n2.&nbsp; We find the ALC properly found\r\n  substantial evidence existed for the hearing officer to find Mason guilty of both\r\n  convictions.[2]Â \r\n  This court may affirm the decision of the ALC if it is supported by substantial\r\n  evidence. Â S.C. Code Ann.

Â The Department presented evidence to\r\n  support Mason's disciplinary conviction for smuggling contraband.Â  Officer Marsico's\r\n  report identified the contraband, and the confidential informant connected\r\n  Mason to the contraband.Â  Additionally, evidence existed to support the\r\n  Department's finding Mason guilty of attempted escape.Â  Mason had several cuts\r\n  on his body soon after the incident, and the warden's confidential informant\r\n  had knowledge that Mason attempted to climb over the fence in order to get the\r\n  packages.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, KONDUROS,\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] We decline to address Mason's issue regarding the reliability\r\n  of the confidential informant because this issue was not raised at the\r\n  hearing.Â  See Al-Shabazz, 338 S.C. at 379, 527 S.E.2d at\r\n  755&nbsp;(finding issues not raised to and ruled upon by the trial court are\r\n  not preserved for review).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-324","title":"In the Interest of Keith W.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayUnPubOpinion.cfm?caseNo=2011-UP-324","description":null,"date":"2011-06-22","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n\t\t<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nP.heading {\r\ntext-align:center\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS OPINION HAS NO\r\n  PRECEDENTIAL VALUE.Â  IT SHOULD NOT BE CITED OR RELIED ON AS PRECEDENT IN ANY\r\n  PROCEEDING EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY RULE 268(d)(2), SCACR.\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Interest\r\n          of Keith W.,\r\n        A minor under\r\n          the age of seventeen, Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Cherokee County\r\nWesley L.

Oswald, 376 S.C. 251, 254, 656 S.E.2d 380, 382 (2008).&nbsp; Under Jay's theory of the case, both the\r\nantiques and the cows were initially owned exclusively by John Meehan, not Jay Meehan.&nbsp; It is not clear whether Jay claims the legal right to possess this\r\nproperty by gift from John or by sale.&nbsp; The law does not support the claim under either theory.&nbsp; Jay could not have obtained the property by gift\r\nbecause he never took actual possession.&nbsp; See Baptist Found. for Christian Educ. v. Baptist Coll. at Charleston, 282 S.C. 53, 58, 317 S.E.2d\r\n453, 457 (Ct. App. 1984) (requiring immediate transfer of possession to complete gift).&nbsp; The theory that Jay obtained the property by sale is refuted for\r\ntwo reasons.&nbsp; First, the alleged written agreement detailing the sale of the disputed property is not in the record.&nbsp; See Rule 1002, SCRE\r\n(&quot;To prove the content of a writing . . . the original writing . . . is required . . . .&quot;).&nbsp; Second, the agreement was not made until after Jay\r\ncompleted the work for which he was allegedly being compensated.&nbsp; &quot;Promises made on a consideration that is wholly past, without any new consideration\r\nmoving to it, are void, as being without consideration.&quot;&nbsp; Jackson v. Carter, 128 S.C. 79, 86,121 S.E. 559, 562&nbsp;(1924) (quoting Garrett\r\nv. Stuart, 1 McCord 514 (1821)). &nbsp;Thus, we affirm the directed verdict as to each of the four defendants with regard to the categories of property that\r\nincluded the antiques and the cows.\r\nBecause Jay failed to demonstrate a legal right to possess either the antiques or the cows, we address the remaining issues with regard only to his personal\r\neffects. &nbsp;Jay Meehan concedes, &quot;Judge Nicholson was correct that where there is a voluntary bailment, the law expects a demand.&quot;&nbsp; See\r\nRoberts v. James, 160 S.C. 291, 158 S.E. 689, 691 (1931).&nbsp; (&quot;Trover will not lie against one rightfully in possession.&nbsp; Such possession\r\nmust first be transformed into a wrongful one by a refusal to surrender the property.&quot;).&nbsp; We conclude this concession applies to both conversion and\r\nto unjust enrichment when the claim is that the defendant unlawfully retained possession of personal property.\r\nWe find that neither Jerry Meehan nor Janet Dorado ever possessed any of Jay's personal property.&nbsp; While it appears that both assisted their mother with\r\nvarious tasks as she moved out of her home, providing such assistance does not mean either exercised possession or detained any of Jay's personal\r\nbelongings.&nbsp; See Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 667, 582 S.E.2d 432, 442&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003) (&quot;Conversion may arise by some\r\nillegal use or misuse, or by illegal detention of another's personal property.&quot;); Gignilliat v. Gignilliat, Savitz &amp; Bettis, L.L.P.,&nbsp;385\r\nS.C. 452, 467, 684 S.E.2d 756, 764&nbsp;(2009) (holding that to prevail under a theory of unjust enrichment, a plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) a benefit\r\nconferred by plaintiff upon the defendant; (2) realization of the benefit by the defendant; and (3) retention of the benefit by the defendant under\r\ncircumstances that make it inequitable for him to retain it without paying its value (internal citations omitted)). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without proof that either\r\nof these defendants possessed Jay's personal effects, Jay's claims against Jerry Meehan and Janet Dorado fail and we find that it is not necessary to determine\r\nwhether a demand was made.&nbsp; Thus, the directed verdict was the appropriate ruling as to both theories of recovery as to Jerry Meehan and Janet Dorado for\r\nthis final category of property, Jay's personal effects.\r\nAfter Robert Newton purchased Mary Meehan's real estate, the personal effects remained on the property until Jerry Meehan attempted to move the property at\r\nMary Meehan's request.&nbsp; The record does not support the inference that Newton illegally detained Jay's personal effects, and we find no evidence exists\r\nthat Newton either converted or was unjustly enriched by Jay's personal effects.&nbsp; We find this claim to be manifestly without merit. &nbsp;See Rule\r\n220(b)(2), SCAR (&quot;The Court of Appeals need not address a point which is manifestly without merit.&quot;).\r\nThe record does not support the inference that Jay made a demand on Mary for their return.&nbsp; Jay claims that he and John made a demand in February 2004\r\nwhen they visited Mary Meehan's real estate and found movers removing personal property from Mary's house.&nbsp; Jerry Meehan was present and Janet Dorado and\r\nMary Meehan arrived later.&nbsp; John demanded to Jerry that the antiques be placed back in Mary's house and the movers complied with John's request.&nbsp; Jay\r\ncontends that this constitutes a demand for the return of all of the disputed property.&nbsp; We find the only interpretation of the statements made by John to\r\nbe a request that the property be placed back in the possession of Mary Meehan, who was allegedly the bailee of the property.&nbsp; Thus, we find the trial\r\ncourt was correct that neither Jay nor John ever made a demand for the return of any property.\r\nJay also claims that a demand would have been futile and that the issue should have been submitted to the jury.&nbsp; See Nixon &amp; Wright v.\r\nRobinson, 104 S.C. 376, 378, 89 S.E. 320, 320 (1916) (&quot;Even if a demand was originally necessary, it is waived if the defendant in his answer sets up\r\ntitle in himself or otherwise shows that a demand would have been futile.&quot;).&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp; Jay makes no claim, and offers no evidence, that Mary\r\nclaimed title to or otherwise claimed ownership over the category of property that included Jay's personal belongings.&nbsp; Therefore, we conclude the record\r\ndoes not support the claim that a demand for his personal property would have been futile. &nbsp;Thus, the trial court was correct in granting a directed\r\nverdict as to all claims against all defendants.&nbsp;\r\nFinally, Jay argues that the trial court erred in directing a verdict in favor of the defendants sua sponte.&nbsp; We disagree with this characterization.\r\n&nbsp;See Black's Law Dictionary 1560 (9th ed. 2009) (defining &quot;sua sponte&quot; as &quot;[w]ithout prompting or suggestion; on its own\r\nmotion.&quot;).&nbsp; Rather, each of the four defendants moved for a directed verdict.&nbsp; During argument on these motions, the trial judge explained that\r\nhe thought a demand was necessary to establish a claim for conversion[2] and allowed the attorneys to consider this\r\npoint of law and respond.&nbsp; We find this was within his discretion.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Jay concedes the trial court's statement of the law was correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-326","title":"Salek v.

Hughston, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2011-UP-326\r\nSubmitted June 1, 2011 â€“ Filed June 27, 2011&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        John Patrick Hayes, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\n        Graham Pollock Powell, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: &nbsp;Chris Salek filed suit against his landlord, Nirenblatt, Nirenblatt &amp; Hoffman, L.L.P., d/b/a Townhouse Village Apartments (NNH),\r\n&nbsp;after falling inside his townhome and sustaining injuries.&nbsp; The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of NNH.&nbsp; Salek appeals, arguing\r\nthe circuit court erred in finding 1) no genuine issue of material fact existed, 2) no evidence existed that NNH had notice of problems with the handrail\r\nbracket in Salek's townhome, and 3) evidence of problems with broken handrail brackets in other townhomes was insufficient to notify NNH of the problem in\r\nSalek's townhome.&nbsp; For the following reasons, we affirm.[1]&nbsp;\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when &quot;the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if\r\nany, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.&quot;&nbsp; Rule 56(c),\r\nSCRCP.&nbsp; When reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard that governs the circuit court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.&nbsp;\r\nEnglert, Inc. v. Netherlands Ins. Co., 315 S.C. 300, 302, 433 S.E.2d 871, 873 (Ct. App. 1993).&nbsp; This standard requires all facts and reasonable\r\ninferences to be drawn therefrom to be viewed in the light most favorable to the appellant.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; &quot;Our standard of review in evaluating a\r\nmotion for summary judgment is to liberally construe the record in favor of the nonmoving party and give the nonmoving party the benefit of all favorable\r\ninferences that might reasonably be drawn therefrom.&quot; &nbsp;Estes v. Roper Temp. Servs., Inc., 304 S.C. 120, 121, 403 S.E.2d 157, 158 (Ct. App.\r\n1991).&nbsp; &quot;An appellate court may decide questions of law with no particular deference to the [circuit] court.&quot;&nbsp; In re Campbell, 379\r\nS.C. 593, 599, 666 S.E.2d 908, 911 (2008).&nbsp;\r\nSalek's Statement of the Issues on Appeal characterizes the dispute over notice as a genuine issue of material fact.&nbsp; However, our review of the record\r\nand the parties' briefs reveals Salek challenges only the application of the law to undisputed facts.&nbsp; Consequently, we review the circuit court's decision\r\nto determine whether NNH was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.&nbsp;\r\nThe South Carolina Residential Landlord and Tenant Act[2] (the Act) requires landlords to maintain the premises\r\nthey lease.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-40-440 (2007).&nbsp; &quot;A landlord shall: (1) comply with the requirements of applicable building and housing codes\r\nmaterially affecting health and safety[, and] (2) make all repairs and do whatever is reasonably necessary to put and keep the premises in a fit and habitable\r\ncondition . . . .&quot;&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; With limited statutory exceptions, a landlord may not enter a dwelling unit without the tenant's consent.&nbsp;\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-40-530 (2007).&nbsp;\r\nGenerally, &quot;the tenant may recover actual damages and obtain injunctive relief in a magistrate's or circuit court, without posting bond, for any\r\nnoncompliance by the landlord with the rental agreement or Â§ 27-40-440.&quot;&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-40-610(b) (2007). &nbsp;This court has construed the\r\nlanguage of the Act &quot;to reflect the intent of the Legislature to create a cause of action in favor of the tenant and against the landlord for failure,\r\nafter notice, to keep in good repair.&quot;&nbsp; Watson v. Sellers, 299 S.C. 426, 436, 385 S.E.2d 369, 374 (Ct. App. 1989).&nbsp; The Watson\r\ncourt held (1) the Act was intended for the special benefit of tenants of leased residential premises, &quot;(2) .&nbsp;. . the [Act] explicitly creates a cause\r\nof action in tort for the failure of the landlord to repair a defect in the premises after notice is given as required by the Act[,] and (3) . . . [these\r\nholdings are] consistent with the expressed and underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to create a remedy for residential tenants . . . .&quot;&nbsp; Id.\r\nat 436-37, 385 S.E.2d at 375 (emphasis added).&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  With regard to notice, the Act states:&nbsp;\r\n  (A) A person has notice of a fact if:\r\n  \r\n    (1) the person has actual knowledge of it;\r\n    (2) the person has received a notice or notification of it; or\r\n    (3) from all the facts and circumstances known to him at the time in question he has reason to know that it exists. &nbsp;A person &quot;knows&quot; or\r\n    &quot;has knowledge&quot; of a fact if he has actual knowledge of it.\r\n    (B) A person &quot;notifies&quot; or &quot;gives&quot; a notice or notification to another person by taking steps reasonably calculated to inform the\r\n    other in ordinary course whether or not the other actually comes to know of it. &nbsp;A person &quot;receives&quot; a notice or notification when:\r\n    (1) it comes to his attention; or\r\n    (2) in the case of the landlord, it is delivered at the place of business of the landlord through which the rental agreement was made or at any place\r\n    held out by the landlord as the place for receipt of the communication . . . .\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-40-240 (2007).&nbsp;\r\nWe affirm the circuit court's grant of summary judgment because Salek failed to establish NNH had notice of any defect in the handrail bracket.&nbsp; Without\r\nnotice, NNH owed Salek no duty to repair it.&nbsp; See Watson, 299 S.C. at 436-37, 385 S.E.2d at 375 (requiring landlord receive notice of defect\r\nin the premises before imposing on him a duty to repair it).&nbsp; We find Salek's argument that requiring him to notify NNH of a problem with the bracket would\r\n&quot;allow landlords to technically deny notice of a fact they actually have knowledge of through their common maintenance activities&quot; is meritless.&nbsp;\r\nTwo subsections of the notice statute prohibit this practice.&nbsp; First, &quot;[a] person has notice of a fact if . . . [he] has actual knowledge of it . . .\r\nor .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from all the facts and circumstances known to him at the time in question he has reason to know that it exists.&nbsp; A person 'knows' or\r\n'has knowledge' of a fact if he has actual knowledge of it.&quot;&nbsp; Â§ 27-40-240(A)(1) &amp; (3).&nbsp; Second, &quot;[a] person 'receives' a notice or\r\nnotification when . . . it comes to his attention.&quot;&nbsp; Â§ 27-40-240(B)(1).&nbsp; The plain language of these provisions recognizes any knowledge a\r\nlandlord gains through common maintenance activities as notice.\r\nWe hold knowledge of broken handrail brackets in other units did not place NNH on notice of a defective handrail bracket in Salek's townhome.&nbsp; However,\r\nwe limit the coverage of this ruling to the facts of this case.&nbsp; Section 27-40-240(A)(3) provides a person has notice of a fact if &quot;all the\r\nfacts and circumstances known to him at the time in question&quot; give him &quot;reason to know that it exists.&quot;&nbsp; NNH's maintenance supervisor\r\nindicated she received two types of complaint about handrail brackets, that they broke in two and that they pulled out of the wall.&nbsp; She had received both\r\ntypes of complaint but not in sufficient numbers to recall how many complaints.&nbsp; Neither Salek nor NNH produced further evidence of the number of handrail\r\nbrackets installed or replaced due to failure at the Townhouse Village Apartments.&nbsp; Accordingly, the facts and circumstances known to NNH in June 2005 did\r\nnot give it reason to know a handrail bracket in Salek's townhome was defective.&nbsp; Because Salek failed to establish NNH had notice of a defect in the\r\nhandrail bracket in his townhome, NNH was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.&nbsp; Consequently, the circuit court did not err in granting summary\r\njudgment in NNH's favor.&nbsp;\r\nAFFIRMED.&nbsp;\r\nFEW, C.J., PIEPER and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] &nbsp;We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] S.C.

(Klein).&nbsp; ProFast argues the circuit court\r\nerred in: (1) applying the incorrect standard of review; and (2) failing to conclude as a matter of law that ProFast was entitled to an award of damages up to\r\nthe $7,500 jurisdictional limit of the magistrate's court.&nbsp; We affirm.[1]\r\n1.&nbsp; As to whether the circuit court erred in applying the incorrect standard of review: This issue is not preserved for our review because ProFast did\r\nnot raise this issue to the circuit court in its Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion to reconsider.

Reddix-Smalls,\r\n  295 S.C. 514, 516, 369 S.E.2d 840, 840 (1998) (citation omitted).Â  \r\nSection 36-4-303 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2010)[2] pertains to the situation when a bank's notice of a court ordered asset freeze\r\n  comes too late.Â  Specifically, the statute provides:\r\n\r\n  Any knowledge, notice or stop-payment order received\r\n    by, legal process served upon, or setoff exercised by a payor bank comes too\r\n    late to terminate, suspend, or modify the bank's right or duty to pay an item\r\n    or to charge its customer's account for the item if the knowledge, notice,\r\n    stop-payment order or legal process is received or served and a reasonable time\r\n    for the bank to act thereon expires or the setoff is exercised after the\r\n    earliest of the following:\r\n  (1) the bank accepts or certifies the item;\r\n  (2) the bank pays the item in cash.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-4-303(a) (Supp. 2010). \r\nHere, the master did not abuse his discretion in\r\n  finding Wachovia did not violate the rule to show cause order. Evidence\r\n  in the record indicates Wachovia certified the $58,850.00 official check and\r\n  paid Scaffe $7,000.00 in cash prior to receiving notice of Davison's judgment\r\n  against Scaffe.Â  The Wachovia transaction log and the testimony of the Wachovia\r\n  teller handling the certification of the official check and the cash withdrawal\r\n  indicate the teller completed the transactions at 3:22 p.m. on April 22, 2008.Â \r\n  Wachovia did not receive notice of Davison's judgment against Scaffe until 3:51\r\n  p.m. on April 22, 2008. Â Accordingly, Wachovia certified the check and paid out\r\n  the cash prior to receiving notice of the need to freeze Scaffe's account. Â Additionally,\r\n  Wachovia's certification of the check constituted acceptance of the check,\r\n  thereby legally binding itself to pay the check to one rightfully entitled to\r\n  the funds.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-3-411 (Supp. 2010).Â  \r\n2.Â  As to whether the master improperly refused\r\n  to consider Davison's motion to compel:Â  I'On\r\n    v.

As to whether the master\r\n  erred in awarding no damages or attorney's fees to Davison: Id.

Â§ 1-23-380(5) (Supp. 2010).&nbsp; However,\r\nthis court may reverse or modify a decision if it is affected by an error of law or is arbitrary or capricious.&nbsp; Â§ 1-23-380(5)(d), (f).&nbsp;\r\n&quot;Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, but evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the\r\nconclusion the agency reached.&quot; Converse Power Corp. v.

Rosen, and Rebecca Nurick (collectively, Rosens) appeal the trial court's order granting summary judgment\r\nto the University of South Carolina and the University of South Carolina Gamecock Club (collectively, the University) on the Rosens' claims for breach of\r\ncontract and constitutional taking.&nbsp; We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThe Rosens donated approximately $140,000 in money and property to the University and, in exchange, became Lifetime Silver Spur Scholarship members in the\r\nGamecock Club.&nbsp; In 1987, the parties executed contracts memorializing the terms of the agreement.&nbsp; Exhibit A to the contracts listed the benefits and\r\npriorities the Rosens received.&nbsp; The exhibit provided:\r\n\r\n  LIFETIME FULL SCHOLARSHIP\r\n  --Four Season Football Tickets (Best Available)\r\n  --Additional Four Season Football Tickets (Total of 8)\r\n  --Assigned Reserved Parking\r\n  --Second Priority on Away and Bowl Game Tickets\r\n  --Tickets May Be Assigned to One Designated Heir\r\n  --Four Season Basketball Tickets (Best Available)\r\n  --Assigned Parking at the Coliseum (If Available)\r\n  --Second Priority on Away and Tournament Game\r\n  Tickets\r\n  --Second Priority on any Tickets Involving any other South Carolina Athletic Events\r\n\r\nIn the contracts, each of the Rosens designated a beneficiary to receive the lifetime membership upon the Rosens' deaths.&nbsp; This designation\r\nprovided:&nbsp; &quot;Upon the death of [], this Lifetime Silver Spur membership will be transferred to [] for his lifetime only.&quot;\r\nIn 2007, the University initiated a fee for the assigned reserved parking at the football stadium for the Gamecock Club donors.&nbsp; Until that time, the\r\nRosens had not paid for parking.&nbsp; However, they had paid for the athletic event tickets.&nbsp;\r\nThe Rosens brought this action against the University originally asserting causes of action for breach of contract, conversion, and violation of the South\r\nCarolina Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA)[1]. They amended their complaint to add a claim for a constitutional\r\ntaking.&nbsp; The University denied their claims.&nbsp; Both sides moved for summary judgment.&nbsp;\r\nThe trial court found all of the issues were subsumed in the breach of contract issue.[2]&nbsp; It held the\r\ncontracts between the University and the Rosens were not ambiguous and contained no language that the privileges were &quot;free&quot; or signified any value\r\nwas assigned to the privileges.&nbsp; It noted the Rosens had paid for the football tickets over the years, including the increases in the price of the tickets.\r\n&nbsp;It found that lifetime donors, such as the Rosens, only received the benefit of maintaining their donor level in the Gamecock Club, regardless of any\r\nincrease in dues, without ever having to contribute yearly dues in the future.&nbsp; The trial court granted the University's motion for summary judgment.&nbsp;\r\nThe Rosens filed a motion to alter or amend, which the trial court denied.&nbsp; This appeal followed.&nbsp;\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis court reviews the grant of a motion for summary judgment applying the same standard that governs the trial court.&nbsp; Wogan v. Kunze, 379 S.C.\r\n581, 585, 666 S.E.2d 901, 903 (2008).&nbsp; Summary judgment is proper where no genuine issue exists as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to\r\njudgment as a matter of law.&nbsp; Id.; Rule 56(c), SCRCP.&nbsp; In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable\r\ninferences that can be drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.&nbsp; Law v. S.C. Dep't of Corr., 368\r\nS.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648 (2006).&nbsp; &quot;Even when there is no dispute as to the evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences\r\nto be drawn from them, summary judgment should be denied.&quot;&nbsp; Wilson v. Style Crest Prods., Inc., 367 S.C. 653, 656, 627 S.E.2d 733, 735\r\n(2006).&nbsp; &quot;[I]n cases applying the preponderance of the evidence burden of proof, the non-moving party is only required to submit a mere scintilla of\r\nevidence in order to withstand a motion for summary judgment.&quot;&nbsp; Hancock v. Mid-South Mgmt. Co., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803\r\n(2009).&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Rosens argue the trial court erred in finding the language of the contracts to be unambiguous.&nbsp;\r\n&quot;It is a question of law for the court whether the language of a contract is ambiguous.&quot;&nbsp; S.C. Dep't of Natural Res. v. Town of\r\nMcClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 623, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302-03 (2001).&nbsp; &quot;Whether a contract is ambiguous is to be determined from the entire contract\r\nand not from isolated portions of the contract.&quot;&nbsp; Farr v. Duke Power Co., 265 S.C. 356, 362, 218 S.E.2d 431, 433 (1975).&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  A contract is ambiguous when it is capable of more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context\r\n  of the entire integrated agreement and who is cognizant of the customs, practices, usages, and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or\r\n  business.\r\n\r\nHawkins v. Greenwood Dev. Corp., 328 S.C. 585, 592, 493 S.E.2d 875, 878 (Ct. App. 1997) (quoting 17A Am.Jur.2d Contracts Â§ 338, at 345\r\n(1991)). &nbsp;Construction of an ambiguous contract is a question of fact.&nbsp; Skull Creek Club Ltd. P'ship v. Cook &amp; Book, Inc., 313 S.C. 283,\r\n286, 437 S.E.2d 163, 165 (Ct. App. 1993).&nbsp;\r\nAt oral argument, the University urged this court to consider that the Rosens paid for football tickets, including the increases in football ticket prices,\r\nas the &quot;customs, practices, [and] usages&quot; of the Gamecock Club.&nbsp; In considering the payment of ticket prices, we must also consider that during\r\nthe same time period, the Rosens were not required to pay for the parking spaces.&nbsp; Exhibit A made no distinction in the language used describing the\r\ntickets and parking spaces.&nbsp; It neither stated additional charges would apply or that the benefits would be free. &nbsp;When considering &quot;the customs,\r\npractices, [and] usages&quot; of the Gamecock Club that despite similar language, the members paid for tickets but did not pay for parking, we find the\r\ncontracts to be ambiguous as to the parking issue. &nbsp;\r\nThe Rosens also contend the designation of beneficiary provision is ambiguous.&nbsp; The provision specified:&nbsp; &quot;Upon the death of [], this Lifetime\r\nSilver Spur membership will be transferred to [] for his lifetime only.&quot;&nbsp; As the Rosens assert, this provision is completely silent as to whether the\r\nbeneficiary can be changed.&nbsp;\r\nThe University relies on this court's opinion in Abu-Shawareb v. S.C. State Univ., 364 S.C. 358, 613 S.E.2d 757 (Ct. App. 2005), to support its\r\ncontention that the provision is not ambiguous.&nbsp; In Abu-Shawareb, this court found the absence of any mention of a bailment action in a settlement\r\nagreement in which the appellant released &quot;any and all claims&quot; against the respondent did not create an ambiguity that would allow the appellant to\r\nintroduce parol evidence that the parties did not intend to include the bailment action in the agreement.&nbsp; Id. at 362-63, 613 S.E.2d at\r\n759-60.&nbsp; This court noted silence alone does not create an ambiguity.&nbsp; Id. at 363, 613 S.E.2d at 760.&nbsp;\r\nHowever, our supreme court and this court have also recognized when an agreement is silent as to a particular matter and because of the nature and character\r\nof the transaction an ambiguity arises, parol evidence may be admitted in order to supply a deficiency in the language of the contract. &nbsp;Penton v. J.F.\r\nCleckley &amp; Co., 326 S.C. 275, 281, 486 S.E.2d 742, 745 (1997); Lindsay v. Lindsay, 328 S.C. 329, 343, 491 S.E.2d 583, 591 (Ct. App. 1997); Ebert\r\nv. Ebert, 320 S.C. 331, 339, 465 S.E.2d 121, 126 (Ct.App.1995); U.S. Leasing Corp. v. Janicare, Inc., 294 S.C. 312, 318, 364 S.E.2d 202, 205, (Ct.\r\nApp. 1988).&nbsp; Parol evidence is admissible not to contradict the terms of the written agreement but to determine the intent of the parties as to that\r\nparticular matter. &nbsp;Id.\r\nIn the present case, the contracts did not specifically prohibit or allow a change of the designated beneficiary.&nbsp; It is impossible from the plain\r\nlanguage of the contracts to determine if the parties intended to allow the change.&nbsp; Thus, we find this provision is also ambiguous.&nbsp;\r\nWe hold the trial court erred in holding the contracts were not ambiguous.&nbsp; Accordingly, the trial court's order granting summary judgment in favor of\r\nthe University is\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.[3]\r\nSHORT, J., concurs.&nbsp; PIEPER, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part in a separate opinion.&nbsp;\r\nPIEPER, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part:&nbsp; I agree with the majority decision to reverse and remand as to the parking issue.&nbsp;\r\nHowever, I respectfully dissent as to the beneficiary issue and would affirm the trial court's determination that the contracts are unambiguous as to this issue\r\nand do not allow a change of beneficiary.\r\nIn regard to the beneficiary provisions, the contracts provided only as follows:&nbsp; &quot;Upon the death of [], this Lifetime Silver Spur membership will\r\nbe transferred to [] for his lifetime only.&quot;&nbsp; As noted in the majority opinion, the contracts do not expressly permit or prohibit a change in\r\nbeneficiaries.&nbsp; However, silence in the contracts regarding the ability to change beneficiaries does not necessarily render the contracts ambiguous.&nbsp; See\r\nJordan v. Sec. Group, Inc., 311 S.C. 227, 230, 428 S.E.2d 705, 707 (1993) (holding silence alone does not create an ambiguity).&nbsp; Rather, the\r\ncontracts are ambiguous only if the absence of language as to whether the Rosens may change beneficiaries renders the agreements reasonably susceptible to more\r\nthan one interpretation. See Abu-Shawareb v. S.C. State Univ., 364 S.C. 358, 363, 613 S.E.2d 757, 760 (Ct.

United Energy\r\nDistribs., 390 S.C. 44, 53-54, 699 S.E.2d 723, 728 (Ct. App. 2010) (holding that where the language of a contract is plain and capable of legal\r\nconstruction, that language alone determines the instrument's force and effect).&nbsp; Looking to the language of the contracts, I find no\r\ninconsistencies.&nbsp; Also, I do not find the beneficiary provisions susceptible to more than one interpretation.&nbsp; Therefore, I would affirm the trial\r\ncourt's determination that the contracts are unambiguous in regard to the beneficiary provisions and do not permit the Rosens to change the named\r\nbeneficiaries.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[1] S.C.

McCurry appeals her convictions on three counts of child abuse with great bodily injury and three counts of unlawful\r\nconduct toward a child, arguing the circuit court erred in (1) allowing McCurry's character to be improperly placed at issue during her co-defendant's opening\r\nstatement; and (2) allowing McCurry to be improperly impeached during trial with testimony of drug usage.&nbsp; We affirm.[1]\r\nIn 2006, McCurry was indicted along with her husband Scott McCurry (Co-defendant) of child abuse with great bodily injury and unlawful conduct toward a\r\nchild.&nbsp; During a direct examination of McCurry, Co-defendant asked McCurry if she was buying drugs.&nbsp; McCurry denied she was buying drugs and denied\r\nshe had a drug problem.&nbsp; Co-defendant sought numerous times to elicit testimony from various witnesses about McCurry's use of crack cocaine.&nbsp;\r\nCo-defendant also referenced McCurry's drug use in his opening and closing statements.\r\nMcCurry contends the circuit court erred in allowing her character to be improperly placed at issue during Co-defendant's opening statement because it was\r\nplain error to allow attacks on her character without her putting it at issue.&nbsp; McCurry contends this was error because no such evidence about her drug use\r\nhad yet been put forth and it was merely done &quot;to prejudice [McCurry] right out of the gate.&quot;&nbsp; McCurry also argues the mention of drugs suggested\r\nan improper basis for the jury's findings and damaged her credibility.&nbsp;\r\n&quot;An objection made during an off-the-record conference which is not made part of the record does not preserve the question for review.&quot;&nbsp; York\r\nv. Conway Ford, Inc.,&nbsp;325 S.C. 170, 173, 480 S.E.2d 726, 728&nbsp;(1997).&nbsp; An objection must be made on a specific ground.&nbsp; State v.\r\nNichols, 325 S.C. 111, 120, 481 S.E.2d 118, 120-21 (1997).&nbsp; &quot;[A] general objection which does not specify the particular ground on which the\r\nobjection is based is insufficient to preserve a question for review.&quot;&nbsp; State v.

Bostick, 307 S.C. 226, 229 n.3, 414\r\nS.E.2d 175, 177 n.3 (Ct.

Ness, Special Referee\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2011-UP-340\r\n  Submitted June 1, 2011 â€“ Filed June 29,\r\n2011Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Frederick James Newton, of Summerville,\r\n          for Appellant.\r\n        J. Martin Harvey, of Barnwell, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Appellant,\r\n  Christopher R. Morris, appeals the order of the special referee ordering Morris\r\n  to specifically perform his obligation to convey property to respondent, Wayne\r\n  Smith, upon the proper tender of money from Smith.Â  Morris contends the special\r\n  referee erred in (1) ruling the parties entered into a valid and enforceable\r\n  agreement, (2) ruling Morris had the right to sell, and did sell, a third party's\r\n  mobile home as part of Morris' sales contract with Smith, (3) construing\r\n  ambiguity in the parties' written agreement in favor of the drafting party, and\r\n  (4) awarding Smith special damages which were speculative.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\n1.&nbsp; As to Morris' argument\r\n  that the referee erred in finding the\r\n  parties entered into a valid and enforceable agreement because the evidence\r\n  showed the parties disagreed as to whether the mobile home was part of the\r\n  sales agreement between them and therefore showed there was a mutual mistake\r\n  between the parties, and, accordingly, there was no meeting of the minds, we\r\n  find this issue is not properly preserved for review.Â  Morris did not\r\n  specifically plead mistake, and never sought to rescind the contract based upon\r\n  mistake.Â  There is nothing in the record to indicate Morris ever argued mutual\r\n  mistake to the referee.Â  Neither did the referee rule on whether there was a\r\n  mutual mistake between the parties, and Morris failed to make a post-trial\r\n  motion to bring the omission of a ruling to the attention of the master.Â  See Nat'l Grange Mut. Ins. Co. v. Firemen's Ins. Co., 310 S.C. 116, 119, 425\r\n  S.E.2d 754, 756 (Ct. App. 1992) (holding, where the theory of mutual mistake\r\n  was not raised in the pleadings as an affirmative defense, appellant did not request\r\n  the relief of reformation, the master did not rule on the issue of mutual\r\n  mistake, and appellant failed to bring this omission to the attention of the\r\n  master by a post-trial motion, the issue of mutual mistake was not preserved\r\n  for appeal).Â  There is simply no indication Morris ever raised to the special\r\n  referee any of this argument he makes now on appeal.\r\n2.&nbsp; In regard to Morris'\r\n  contention that the referee erred in ruling\r\n  Morris had the right to sell a third party's mobile home as part of his sales contract\r\n  with Smith because it was inequitable to\r\n  permit Smith to include a third party's mobile home in the sales contract\r\n  between Smith and Morris where Smith knew the true owner of the mobile home,\r\n  and the evidence indicates Morris intended the sale of the mobile home be\r\n  separate from the sale of the land, we find this issue is both unpreserved and\r\n  abandoned.Â  The only law Morris cites in this portion of his argument provides\r\n  no support for, and is inconsequential to, his assertion on appeal. Â Morris\r\n  cites no law in support of his actual argument that it was inequitable to\r\n  include a third party's mobile home in a sales contract where Smith knew the\r\n  true owner was the third party.Â  See Bryson v. Bryson, 378 S.C. 502, 510, 662 S.E.2d\r\n  611, 615 (Ct. App. 2008) (&quot;An issue is deemed abandoned and will not be considered on appeal if the\r\n  argument is raised in a brief but not supported by authority.&quot;).Â  See also State v. Porter, 389 S.C. 27, 35-36, 698 S.E.2d 237,\r\n  241 (Ct. App. 2010) (holding, where a party cites only to authority that does\r\n  not support the specific argument raised, and fails to cite to any authority\r\n  that supports the specific argument, the argument will be deemed abandoned on\r\n  appeal).Â  Additionally, even if the argument were not abandoned, it is not\r\n  preserved for appellate review, as the record fails to show it was raised to or\r\n  ruled upon by the referee.Â  See I'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant,\r\n  338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000) (noting the losing party generally\r\n  must both present his issues and arguments to the lower court and obtain a\r\n  ruling before an appellate court will review those issues and arguments).\r\n3. We likewise find\r\n  Morris' assertion that the referee erred\r\n  in construing ambiguity in the written agreement in favor of the drafting party\r\n  is not preserved for our review.Â  There is nothing in the record to suggest\r\n  Morris ever asserted to the referee that the written agreement he references was\r\n  ambiguous and/or that an ambiguity in the agreement should be construed against\r\n  Smith since Smith's wife drafted it.Â  Further, the referee's order does not\r\n  address whether the agreement was ambiguous.Â  Finally, Morris did not raise the\r\n  matter in a post-trial motion.Â  Because the matter was never raised to or ruled\r\n  upon by the referee, the issue of ambiguity in the written agreement is not\r\n  preserved.Â  See Mathis v. Brown &amp; Brown of S.C., Inc., 389\r\n  S.C. 299, 311, 698 S.E.2d 773, 779 (2010) (holding, in order for an issue to be\r\n  properly preserved for review, it must have been both raised to and ruled upon\r\n  by the trial court); I'On, L.L.C., 338 S.C. at 422, 526 S.E.2d at 724\r\n  (noting the losing party generally must both present his issues and arguments\r\n  to the lower court and obtain a ruling before an appellate court will review\r\n  those issues and arguments).\r\n4. Lastly, Morris' assertion on\r\n  appeal that the referee erred in awarding Smith special damages because Smith's\r\n  alleged lost profits were the result of a proposed new business and said\r\n  profits were speculative is also not preserved.Â  There is nothing in the record\r\n  to indicate Morris ever argued to the referee that the damages claimed by Smith\r\n  were too speculative to support an award, and Morris failed to file a Rule\r\n  59(e), SCRCP motion requesting the referee address the issue.Â  See Harkins\r\n    v. Greenville County, 340 S.C. 606, 620, 533 S.E.2d 886, 893 (2000) (stating an issue must have been ruled upon by the trial\r\n  court to be preserved for appellate review, and where an appellant has failed\r\n  to have the trial court rule on an issue, the appellate court will not address\r\n  it); I'On, L.L.C., 338 S.C. at 422, 526 S.E.2d at 724 (noting the\r\n  losing party generally must both present his issues and arguments to the lower\r\n  court and obtain a ruling before an appellate court will review those issues\r\n  and arguments); Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56,\r\n  58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (holding an issue is not preserved where the\r\n  trial court does not explicitly rule on an argument and the appellant fails to\r\n  make a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion to alter or amend the judgment on that ground).Â  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons,\r\n  the order of the special referee is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, WILLIAMS, and\r\n  THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-341","title":"Williams v.

Weston, 367\r\n  S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006).Â  &quot;A defendant is entitled to a\r\n  directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense\r\n  charged.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;When reviewing a denial of a directed\r\n  verdict, [an appellate court] views the evidence and all reasonable inferences\r\n  in the light most favorable to the [S]tate.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;If there\r\n  is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably\r\n  tending to prove the guilt of the accused, the [appellate court] must find the\r\n  case was properly submitted to the jury.&quot;Â  Id. at 292-93, 625\r\n  S.E.2d at 648.Â  &quot;Before a person may be convicted of the offense of\r\n  trafficking, the State must prove the person knowingly possessed ten or more\r\n  grams of cocaine.Â  A person's mere presence, where the drugs are present, would\r\n  not be sufficient to convict, without more.&quot;Â  State v. Scott, 303\r\n  S.C. 360, 363, 400 S.E. 2d 784, 786 (Ct. App. 1991) (internal citation and\r\n  quotation marks omitted).Â  \r\nThe State\r\n  produced evidence of Dantzler's dominion and control over the vehicle and glove\r\n  box where the drugs were found: Dantzler was seated in the front passenger seat\r\n  at the time of the traffic stop, approximately one foot from the glove box\r\n  containing the cocaine. He was unusually nervous and agitated while the police\r\n  considered towing and taking inventory of the vehicle, he made repeated attempts\r\n  to control the disposition of the vehicle, and he fled immediately upon seeing\r\n  the glove box opened.Â  Thus, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable\r\n  to the State, the evidence supported submitting the case to the jury.\r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nSHORT, KONDUROS,\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 214, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-344","title":"State v.

Michael\r\n          Ethridge, both of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Sandra\r\n  Zimmerman appeals the trial court's order granting summary judgment in favor of\r\n  MyrBeach Mortgage, LLC, D/B/A Days Inn at Waccamaw, (MyrBeach) on Zimmerman's\r\n  negligence claim in which the court found MyrBeach was not vicariously liable\r\n  for the acts of Danny Sweigert.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn June 11, 2006, Zimmerman\r\n  was injured in an automobile accident.Â  The car in which Zimmerman was the\r\n  passenger was driven by Sweigert.Â  At the time of the accident, Sweigert was\r\n  serving as the manager of the Days Inn while trying to find a purchaser for the\r\n  hotel.Â  Myrbeach's predecessor had hired Sweigert in 2003 to oversee the\r\n  renovation and reconstruction of the Days Inn, reopen the hotel, and ultimately\r\n  sell the facility.Â  Sweigert lived in the hotel and was on-call every day.Â \r\n  However, he did take time off.Â  Zimmerman was also living at the hotel at the\r\n  time of the accident.Â  \r\nThe accident occurred on a\r\n  Sunday afternoon.Â  Sweigert stated he was taking the day off and was sitting by\r\n  the pool doing a crossword puzzle when Zimmerman and another extended stay\r\n  guest asked him to drive them to K-Mart.Â  The accident happened on the way to\r\n  the store.Â  \r\nZimmerman brought this action\r\n  against Sweigert, the other driver involved in the accident, and MyrBeach.Â  She\r\n  asserted MyrBeach was liable under the doctrines of respondeat superior,\r\n  principal/agent, and master/servant.Â  MyrBeach moved for summary judgment,\r\n  asserting Sweigert was not acting within the scope of his employment at the\r\n  time of the accident, and he was an independent contractor rather than employee\r\n  of MyrBeach.Â  The trial court granted the motion, finding &quot;there is\r\n  absolutely no evidence that Sweigert was acting within the scope of employment\r\n  or doing any activity related to the business of MyrBeach at the time of the\r\n  accident.&quot;Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the grant of\r\n  summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard that governs\r\n  the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Nexsen v. Haddock, 353 S.C.\r\n  74, 77, 576 S.E.2d 183, 185 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Summary judgment should be\r\n  granted when &quot;the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\r\n  admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\r\n  genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to\r\n  a judgment as a matter of law.&quot;Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  &quot;In determining\r\n  whether any triable issues of fact exist, the court must view the evidence and\r\n  all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the evidence in the light most\r\n  favorable to the non-moving party.&quot;Â  Brockbank v. Best Capital Corp.,\r\n  341 S.C. 372, 378-79, 534 S.E.2d 688, 692 (2000).Â  &quot;[I]n cases applying\r\n  the preponderance of the evidence burden of proof, the non-moving party is only\r\n  required to submit a mere scintilla of evidence in order to withstand a motion\r\n  for summary judgment.&quot;Â  Hancock v. Mid-South Mgmt. Co., 381 S.C.\r\n  326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803 (2009).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nZimmerman argues the trial\r\n  court erred in granting summary judgment because there was a genuine issue of\r\n  material fact whether Sweigert was acting within the course and scope of his\r\n  employment when the accident occurred.Â  \r\n\r\n  The\r\n    doctrine of respondeat superior rests upon the relation of master and servant. Â A\r\n    plaintiff seeking recovery from the master for injuries must establish that the\r\n    relationship existed at the time of the injuries, and also that the servant was\r\n    then about his master's business and acting within the scope of his employment.\r\n    Â An act is within the scope of a servant's employment where reasonably\r\n    necessary to accomplish the purpose of his employment and in furtherance of the\r\n    master's business. Â These general principles govern in determining whether an\r\n    employer is liable for the acts of his servant. Â \r\n  The act\r\n    of a servant done to effect some independent purpose of his own and not with\r\n    reference to the service in which he is employed, or while he is acting as his\r\n    own master for the time being, is not within the scope of his employment so as\r\n    to render the master liable therefor. Â Under these circumstances the servant\r\n    alone is liable for the injuries inflicted. Â If a servant steps aside from the\r\n    master's business for some purpose wholly disconnected with his employment, the\r\n    relation of master and servant is temporarily suspended; this is so no matter\r\n    how short the time, and the master is not liable for his acts during such time. \r\n\r\nArmstrong v. Food Lion,\r\n  Inc., 371 S.C. 271, 276, 639 S.E.2d\r\n  50, 52-53 (2006) (citations omitted).\r\nZimmerman relies on Grant\r\n  v. Grant Textiles, 372 S.C. 196, 641 S.E.2d 869 (2007), a workers'\r\n  compensation case in which the supreme court held under certain circumstances, injuries\r\n  arising from acts outside the scope of an employee's regular duties may be\r\n  compensable. Â These circumstances are: \r\n\r\n  (1) acts benefiting co-employees; (2) acts benefiting\r\n    customers or strangers; (3) acts benefiting the claimant; and (4) acts\r\n    benefiting the employer privately.Â  An act outside an employee's regular duties\r\n    which is undertaken in good faith to advance the employer's interest, whether\r\n    or not the employee's own assigned work is thereby furthered, is within the\r\n    course of employment.\r\n\r\nId. at 201, 641 S.E.2d at 871-72 (citations omitted).\r\nZimmerman contends a genuine\r\n  issue of fact exists because Sweigert did extra services for extended stay\r\n  guests.Â  Sweigert testified that about once a week he would put together a\r\n  barbeque in the courtyard for the extended stay guests.Â  He also held a Super\r\n  Bowl party for the extended stay guests.Â  However, there is no testimony he\r\n  provided transportation for those guests other than Zimmerman and the other\r\n  passenger.Â  Nor is there any evidence he was going to the store in preparation\r\n  for one of those events.Â  \r\nSweigert maintained that at\r\n  the time of the accident, he was not working and was on personal time.Â  He\r\n  stated he was driving his personal car and doing a favor for a friend.Â  \r\nZimmerman testified she and\r\n  Sweigert were &quot;boyfriend and girlfriend&quot; and were dating off and on.Â \r\n  She stated they went places together, including dinner dates.Â  She claimed\r\n  Sweigert let her stay at the hotel without paying for at least part of the time\r\n  she was there due to their relationship.Â  She could not remember any other\r\n  payment arrangements.Â  When asked if he had a romantic relationship with\r\n  Zimmerman, Sweigert, who was married, admitted they were friends and that he\r\n  was &quot;very fond&quot; of her.Â  \r\nEven if the workers'\r\n  compensation case Grant is applicable, we find no evidence Sweigert's\r\n  driving Zimmerman to the store was undertaken in good faith to advance his\r\n  employer's interest. Â The evidence only demonstrates Sweigert was doing a\r\n  personal favor for a friend.Â  Accordingly, we hold the trial court correctly\r\n  ruled there was no evidence Sweigert was acting within the scope of his\r\n  employment at the time of the accident. Â Therefore, the order of the trial\r\n  court granting summary judgment in favor of MyrBeach is\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nHUFF, SHORT, and PIEPER,\r\n  JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-346","title":"Batson v.

Batson, Jr. was valid and enforceable.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nBatson was an adjoining\r\n  landowner with Charles and Anne Bell.Â  He owned the property known as Lot 4\r\n  while the Bells owned Lots 1, 2, and 3, as well as a strip of land located\r\n  between Lot 3 and Dogwood Trail, a private drive.Â  On July 21, 1965, the Bells\r\n  granted Batson an express easement across their property to his adjoining\r\n  property (the Instrument).Â  The Instrument granted Batson:\r\n\r\n  A\r\n    right-of-way twenty (20) feet in width, for the purpose of ingress and egress,\r\n    leading from the rear portion of Lot 4 . . . across the rear portions of Lots 3\r\n    and 2, and then in a Southeasterly direction through Lot 1, and through a strip\r\n    of land described in a deed from Aleene L. Parham to Charles W. Bell and Anne\r\n    W. Bell . . . into Dogwood Drive [also known as Dogwood Trail]. \r\n  The\r\n    aforementioned right-of-way shall be in such specific location (not\r\n    inconsistent with the above general location) as shall least interfere with the\r\n    use and development of said lots by the grantors, and at the election of the\r\n    grantors, the use of said right-of-way by the grantee shall be in common with\r\n    the grantors.Â  \r\n\r\nAt the time of the execution\r\n  of the Instrument, Dogwood Trail was a private road and remains that way\r\n  today.Â  The former owners of Dogwood Trail and the property east of the Bells'\r\n  property had transferred the road to Greenville County in 1952.Â  The County,\r\n  however, transferred the road back to then-owners C.E. Singleton and Julia\r\n  Belle Singleton in 1954.Â  Doril L. Howell is the current owner of the property\r\n  and has not granted Batson the right to use the road.Â  Batson has yet to\r\n  construct a roadway pursuant to the Instrument.Â  \r\nTad Mallory purchased the\r\n  Bells' property on September 8, 2005.Â  He subsequently transferred the property\r\n  to Northside Traders, LLC, of which he is the managing member.Â  Soon after\r\n  Mallory acquired the property, Batson contacted him about reaching an agreement\r\n  as to the specific location of the easement.Â  Mallory did not deny being aware\r\n  of the easement.Â Â  Instead, he stated he believed it was not enforceable and\r\n  was void.Â  \r\nBatson brought this action\r\n  seeking a declaration he has a valid and enforceable easement terminating at\r\n  View Point Drive.Â  He also requested an injunction prohibiting Northside from\r\n  interfering with his right to construct a road terminating at View Point Drive.Â  \r\nThe parties filed\r\n  cross-motions for summary judgment.Â  The trial court held, &quot;[i]t is clear\r\n  that the grantors' intent was to give Batson, his heirs and assigns a\r\n  right-of-way through the grantor's property that ultimately terminated at View\r\n  Point Drive.Â  The Instrument evidences this intent, and the grantors\r\n  incorporated sufficient flexibility into the Instrument to allow the\r\n  right-of-way to continue south through Lot 1 into View Point Drive.&quot;Â \r\n  Thus, the trial court declared the easement valid and enforceable and ruled\r\n  Batson, his heirs and assigns could install and enjoy the right of way in the\r\n  general location described in the Instrument, with such right-of-way\r\n  terminating at View Point Drive.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nNorthside argues that the\r\n  easement was void ab initio or is extinguished.Â  It asserts the purpose\r\n  of the easement was to provide ingress and egress into Dogwood Trail and\r\n  because Batson did not have the right to use Dogwood Trail, the easement could\r\n  never be used.Â  We disagree with this interpretation of the Instrument creating\r\n  the easement.Â  \r\n&quot;A grant of an easement\r\n  is to be construed in accordance with the rules applied to deeds and other\r\n  written instruments.&quot; Â K &amp; A Acquisition Group, LLC v. Island\r\n    Pointe, LLC, 383 S.C. 563, 581, 682 S.E.2d 252, 262 (2009) (internal\r\n  quotation omitted).Â  In construing a deed, &quot;the intention of the grantor\r\n  must be ascertained and effectuated, unless that intention contravenes some\r\n  well settled rule of law or public policy.&quot; Â Id.(internal quotation\r\n  omitted.) Â &quot;In determining the grantor's intent, the deed must be\r\n  construed as a whole and effect given to every part if it can be done\r\n  consistently with the law.&quot; Â Id.(internal quotation omitted) \r\nReading the Instrument as a\r\n  whole, we agree with the trial court the purpose of the Instrument was to give\r\n  Batson an easement through the Bells' property &quot;for the purpose of ingress\r\n  and egress&quot; to his property and not specifically to grant him access &quot;into\r\n  Dogwood Trail.&quot;Â  According to a survey prepared for Mallory, Dogwood Trail\r\n  intersects with View Point Drive slightly to the south of the &quot;strip of\r\n  land.&quot;Â  It leads to no other public road.Â  As the trial court noted, if\r\n  the purpose of the Instrument was to give Batson ingress and egress into Dogwood\r\n  Drive, there would have been no reason to direct the easement through the &quot;strip\r\n  of land&quot; when the more direct route would have been north of the strip of\r\n  land.Â  \r\nThe Instrument clearly\r\n  provided the specifications given were for a &quot;general location&quot; of\r\n  the easement and provided for flexibility in locating the easement.Â  The fact\r\n  that Batson had other access to View Point Drive is immaterial as the easement\r\n  is not one by necessity.Â  We hold the parties intended for Batson to have\r\n  additional access to his property through the Bells' property.Â  We find the Instrument\r\n  is valid and enforceable.Â  \r\nNorthside also argues the\r\n  trial court erred in relocating the easement to terminate at the public road,\r\n  View Point Drive. Â See Sheppard v. Justin Enters., 373 S.C. 518, 521,\r\n  646 S.E.2d 177, 178 (Ct.

Thomas Cooper, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2011-UP-354\r\nHeard April 4, 2011 â€“ Filed June 30, 2011&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Chief Appellate Defender Robert M. Dudek, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Alan Wilson, Chief Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, and Assistant Attorney General Anthony Mabry, all of Columbia; and\r\n        Solicitor Isaac McDuffie Stone, III, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nFEW, C.J.: On September 16, 2006, Katherine Herrera was shot in the back of her head.&nbsp; Investigators found her dead on the floor beside the\r\ntoilet in her home with her pants down and toilet paper still in her hand.&nbsp; Jose Herrera, Katherine's husband, was arrested three days later and eventually\r\nconvicted of murder and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.&nbsp; The trial court sentenced him to life for murder and five years\r\nfor the gun possession charge.&nbsp; On appeal, Herrera challenges the trial court's denial of his request to charge the jury on involuntary manslaughter and\r\naccident and the admission of photographs of holes in the walls of his home.&nbsp; We affirm.&nbsp;\r\nFACTS\r\nDuring the two days following Katherine's death, Herrera relayed three different versions of events to investigators.&nbsp;\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Herrera's First Version of Events\r\nCorporal Rhett Parnell of the Beaufort County Sheriff's Office was among the first police officers to arrive at Herrera's house and speak to him on the day\r\nof the murder.[1]&nbsp; Herrera told Parnell that he left home to go to the store and that when he returned, he\r\ndiscovered his wife &quot;was deceased&quot; in their bathroom.&nbsp; He also gave a consistent written statement, in which he explained that he called 911 and\r\ngot Madison, Katherine's daughter, out of the home.&nbsp;\r\nCaptain Robert Bromage, also of the Beaufort County Sheriff's Office, listened to a recording of Herrera's 911 call.&nbsp; He &quot;found it suspicious&quot;\r\nthat Herrera &quot;mentioned that it was a small caliber pistol that inflicted the wound to his wife and she was deceased.&quot; &nbsp;At the scene, Herrera\r\ntold Bromage that he came back from the store and &quot;looked around for a little bit, and then found her in the bathroom, and then noticed . . . a small\r\ncaliber gunshot wound.&quot;&nbsp; Bromage took Herrera into custody and spoke to him again that night at the Bluffton Police Station where he repeated that he\r\ndiscovered Katherine dead in the bathroom.\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Herrera's Second Version of Events\r\nTwo days later, on September 18, 2006, Bromage spoke with Herrera again at the Beaufort County Law Enforcement Center.&nbsp; Bromage informed Herrera that\r\nthe police found a box of ammunition in the woods and showed him a picture of the gun that was found.[2]&nbsp; At\r\nthis point, Herrera changed his explanation of what happened.&nbsp; Herrera said that he and Katherine were arguing and she became angry when he told her he\r\nwanted to leave.&nbsp; According to this version of events, Katherine grabbed Herrera's pistol and pointed it at her head.&nbsp; Herrera explained, &quot;I went\r\nto reach for it.&nbsp; When I reached up to get it, [it] just accidentally shot itself.&quot;&nbsp; He said, &quot;She pointed at her head . . . .&nbsp; That's\r\nwhen I went in because I didn't want my wife doing anything like that.&nbsp; I love my wife.&nbsp; She--when I reached in, she let go of it.&nbsp; When she let\r\ngo, I guess my hand went on the trigger.&quot;&nbsp; Herrera said he &quot;panicked&quot; and called 911 and threw the gun away.&nbsp; He told Bromage that the\r\nshooting &quot;was not intentional.&quot;&nbsp;\r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Herrera's Third Version of Events\r\nLater in the afternoon on September 18, 2006, Bromage interviewed Herrera a third time.&nbsp; In this interview, Herrera relayed a third version of\r\nevents.&nbsp; Herrera explained, &quot;I just wanted to scare her.&nbsp; It was an accident, sir.&nbsp; I didn't mean it.&quot;&nbsp; He said Katherine pushed\r\nhim and tried to hit him.&nbsp; &quot;And that's when it pissed me off.&nbsp; And I did grab the pistol.&quot;&nbsp; Herrera said he &quot;went in [the\r\nbathroom] to try to scare her.&quot;&nbsp; He testified, &quot;And I slipped. . . .&nbsp; I slipped, my hand hit her shoulder or something.&nbsp; And that's\r\nwhen the trigger went off.&quot;&nbsp;\r\nAs Herrera continued to go over what happened, the story evolved.&nbsp; He explained that he tripped on Katherine's legs.&nbsp; He told Bromage, &quot;That's\r\nwhen I just grabbed the pistol[3] and just (inaudible) get her off my back.&nbsp; And that's when I just fired.&nbsp;\r\nJust like I said, I tripped and it fired. . . .&nbsp; I fired it.&quot;&nbsp; Later in the conversation, Herrera told Bromage &quot;my mind went blank to a\r\ncertain extent that I didn't quite remember. . . .&nbsp; I know I fired it because it was in my hand the last time I remember it.&quot;&nbsp; He explained,\r\n&quot;I tripped over her and (inaudible) and that's when the gun went off.&quot; &nbsp;Herrera testified, &quot;It might not have even been her feet.&nbsp;\r\nMight have been my kitten. . . .&nbsp; I know I tripped over something.&quot;&nbsp; He repeated this version a final time, and this time said, &quot;And I just\r\nwalked in there (inaudible) and fired the pistol.&quot;&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jury Charge\r\nHerrera requested that the trial court charge the jury on voluntary manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter and accident.&nbsp; Herrera contends the trial\r\ncourt erred in failing to charge involuntary manslaughter and accident.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\nInvoluntary manslaughter is the unintentional killing of another without malice and while engaged in either (1) an unlawful act not amounting to a felony[4] and not naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm or (2) a lawful act with reckless disregard for the\r\nsafety of others.&nbsp; State v. Light, 378 S.C. 641, 647, 664 S.E.2d 465, 468 (2008) (internal citations omitted); Burris, 334 S.C. at 265, 513\r\nS.E.2d at 109 (1999).&nbsp; For a homicide to be excusable on the ground of accident, it must be shown the killing was unintentional, the defendant was acting\r\nlawfully, and due care was exercised in the handling of a weapon.&nbsp; Burris, 334 S.C. at 259, 513 S.E.2d at 106 (citing State v. Goodson, 312\r\nS.C. 278, 280, 440 S.E.2d 370, 372 (1994)).\r\nAs to involuntary manslaughter, the trial court explained,\r\n\r\n  [I]t seems to me that either pointing or presenting a loaded or unloaded firearm is a violation of the statute.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, it's a\r\n  felony.&nbsp; And the involuntary charge is defined as the killing of another without malice and unintentionally while engaged in either an unlawful act not\r\n  amounting to a felony â€“ which we don't have here â€“ or an unlawful act with reckless disregard.&nbsp; I mean, involuntary is the killing of another almost\r\n  like an accident.\r\n\r\nAs to accident, Herrera argued &quot;that he tripped.&nbsp; So there's evidence in the record that the jury could find it was an accident, and that [he is]\r\nentitled to an accident charge.&quot;&nbsp; Herrera argued that he was lawfully in possession of the gun in his own home pursuant to Burris.&nbsp; The\r\ntrial court ruled:\r\n\r\n  The facts are so much different than Burris than they are here, not that that is dispositive.&nbsp; But Burris is a self-defense case.&nbsp;\r\n  And self-defense is not an unlawful act.&nbsp; And Burris possessed a pistol in that case.&nbsp; And I just think that is not what we have here.&nbsp; Here we\r\n  have a pointing and presenting, regardless of how the defendant characterizes it, which is a felony.&nbsp; . . .&nbsp; I think this case needs to go to the\r\n  jury on murder and voluntary manslaughter and that's it; and that's the way I so rule.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDuring the charge conference, Herrera and the State both limited their arguments to Herrera's third version of events to determine what the jury should be\r\ncharged.&nbsp; Based on our review of the record, we conclude that the trial court considered only the third version of events and not the first two versions of\r\nevents.&nbsp; Thus, the third version of events served as the sole basis for the trial court's ruling.&nbsp;\r\nHerrera now points to the second version of events in support of his argument that evidence in the record supports charging involuntary manslaughter and\r\naccident.&nbsp; However, because Herrera never argued either his first or second version of events as a basis for the requested jury charges, the judge never\r\nruled on these grounds.&nbsp; We find that it was incumbent upon Herrera to make the legal arguments that the first and second versions of his statement should\r\nhave been considered to preserve the issue for appellate review.&nbsp; Objections should be made to the trial court in a &quot;sufficiently specific manner that\r\nbrings attention to the exact error&quot; and failure to properly object results in a procedural bar from raising the issue on appeal&nbsp; See State\r\nv. Johnson, 363 S.C. 53, 58-59, 609 S.E.2d 520, 523&nbsp;(2005) (internal citations omitted).&nbsp; Further, a party may not argue one ground at trial and\r\nan alternate ground on appeal. &nbsp;State v. Dickman, 341 S.C. 293, 295, 534 S.E.2d 268, 269 (2000).&nbsp; We find that this issue is not preserved for\r\nour review.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Admission of Photographs\r\nThe State introduced several close-up photographs of holes in the walls of Herrera's home, which the State argued demonstrated &quot;the force used to make\r\nthe holes.&quot;&nbsp; The trial court ruled that the photographs were admissible as evidence of a &quot;previous quarrel&quot; to demonstrate that animus\r\nprobably existed between the parties. &nbsp;Captain Bromage testified about his observations of the crime scene and explained that he &quot;noticed holes in the\r\nwall that were obviously suspicious.&quot;&nbsp; He also testified, &quot;I told [Herrera] there were signs of domestic violence all over the house.&nbsp; And I\r\nasked him where the holes came from. . . .&nbsp; He said it came from before . . . .&quot;\r\n&quot;The relevance, materiality, and admissibility of photographs are matters within the sound discretion of the trial court and a ruling will be disturbed\r\nonly upon a showing of an abuse of discretion.&quot;&nbsp; State v. Shuler, 353 S.C. 176, 184, 577 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2003).&nbsp; We find that it was\r\nwithin the trial court's discretion to admit the photographs as evidence of a previous quarrel between Katherine and Herrera.&nbsp; See State v.\r\nBraxton, 343 S.C. 629, 636, 541 S.E.2d 833, 836-37 (2001) (&quot;In homicide cases, evidence of previous quarrels and ill feelings is admissible to show\r\nthat animus probably existed between the parties at the time of the homicide.&quot;).&nbsp;\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTHOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Herrera was not in custody during this conversation.\r\n[2] Herrera's neighbor testified that she found a box of bullets on her side of the fence about five feet away\r\nfrom the fence surrounding Herrera's yard.&nbsp; Sergeant Jeff Lauver, a K-9 officer with the Beaufort Sheriff's Office, testified that his search dog found a\r\nweapon near Herrera's home.&nbsp;\r\n[3] Herrera admitted to throwing the gun &quot;between the Y area in the road&quot; where the police recovered\r\nit.&nbsp; He also admitted that he threw the bullets &quot;behind the shed.&quot;&nbsp;\r\n[4] Some recent cases have not included the phrase &quot;not amounting to a felony&quot; from this element of\r\ninvoluntary manslaughter.&nbsp; See, e.g., State v. Gibson, 390 S.C. 347, 356, 701 S.E.2d 766, 771 (2010); State v. Rivera, 389 S.C. 399,\r\n404, 699 S.E.2d 157, 159 (2010) (citing State v. Mekler, 379 S.C. 12, 15, 664 S.E.2d 477, 478 (2008), which does not include the phrase but cites State\r\nv. Burris, 334 S.C. 256, 264, 513 S.E.2d 104, 109 (1999), which does include the phrase); State v. Wharton, 381 S.C. 209, 216, 672 S.E.2d 786, 789\r\n(2009); State v. Brayboy, 387 S.C. 174, 180, 691 S.E.2d 482, 485 (Ct.

Farthing, all of Columbia; Solicitor Scarlett Anne Wilson, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; In Theodore Cobbs' trial on multiple counts of sexual assault against two of his stepchildren, the State sought to explain why the\r\nvictims did not reveal the crimes for thirteen years by arguing that Cobbs kept the victims isolated and controlled every aspect of their lives.&nbsp; Cobbs\r\nattempted to counter the State's argument by offering into evidence a compilation of home video clips which Cobbs contends refuted the argument of\r\ncontrol.&nbsp; The trial court excluded the video compilation under Rules 1002 and 1003, SCRE.&nbsp; Cobbs was convicted of four counts of first-degree criminal\r\nsexual conduct on a minor, seven counts of second-degree criminal sexual conduct on a minor, and two counts of unlawful conduct toward a child.&nbsp; Cobbs\r\nappeals his convictions claiming the trial court erred in excluding the video compilation.&nbsp; We find that even if the trial court erred in excluding the\r\nevidence, the error was harmless.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMultiple witnesses testified to the same facts and circumstances shown in the video clips, and to that extent the video compilation was cumulative.&nbsp;\r\nThough some of the video clips might add an element to the testimony not otherwise available to the jury, that element was not altogether helpful to Cobbs.&nbsp;\r\nAfter a detailed examination of all scenes in the video compilation, we find that some of the clips support the argument of control just as strongly as other\r\nclips tend to refute the argument.&nbsp; We further find that the admission of those portions which tend to refute the argument of control could not reasonably\r\nhave affected the outcome of the trial.&nbsp; We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities: State v.

See Townes Assocs., Ltd. v.\r\n    City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976) (&quot;In\r\n  an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of\r\n  fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without\r\n  evidence which reasonably supports the judge's findings.&quot;); Stewart v.\r\n    Charleston Cnty.

App. 2009) (&quot;In an action at law, tried without a jury, the\r\n  appellate court will not disturb the [trial] court's findings of fact unless no\r\n  evidence reasonably supports them.&quot;).Â  Moreover, to the extent Lakes\r\n  focuses its appeal on the failure of the circuit court to make factual findings\r\n  regarding: (1) whether JB had adequate sales people or staff to secure contracts\r\n  for sale on the project and adequately directed the efforts of such staff; (2)\r\n  whether JB was providing additional information to customers and/or their\r\n  agents in effecting the sale of property; and (3) whether JB was keeping Lakes\r\n  informed as to the progress of finding prospective buyers, JB should have\r\n  specifically asked the trial court to address these three grounds via a motion\r\n  to alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  See Travelscape,\r\n    LLC v.

Farr, both of\r\n          Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Ronald\r\n  and Diana Price (the Prices) appeal from the trial court's order granting\r\n  Investors Title Insurance Company's (Investors) motion for specific performance\r\n  and to enforce a settlement agreement.Â  We reverse and remand.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 2003, the Prices purchased a tract of land in Eagle\r\n  Harbor Subdivision in Berkeley County.Â  Investors issued a title insurance\r\n  policy covering the property. Â After closing, the Prices discovered alleged\r\n  defects they contended were covered under the policy.Â  The Prices filed this\r\n  action against Investors seeking coverage. Â Having relieved prior counsel, the\r\n  Prices represented themselves and agreed to mediation. \r\nThe case was mediated on November 20, 2008, and the parties\r\n  signed a settlement agreement.Â  The agreement stated Investors would pay the\r\n  Prices $12,500, and it further provided:Â  \r\n\r\n  2. Counsel for the Defendants\r\n    shall prepare a Release and Consent Order of Dismissal of the above action,\r\n    which shall be executed by the Plaintiffs . . . . \r\n  3. The terms of this Settlement\r\n    Agreement shall satisfy the requirements of the South Carolina Rules of Civil\r\n    Procedure regarding a stipulation for settlement and conclusion of the above\r\n    Case, and in the absence of a Consent Order as referenced above, may be entered\r\n    into record by any Party to this action to conclude this Case, with prejudice\r\n    as to all claims which were or could have been asserted therein. \r\n\r\nThe following week, the Prices revoked the agreement\r\n  by facsimile to the mediator, copying counsel for Investors.Â  The Prices\r\n  allegedly expected to receive further documentation, in the form of a\r\n  &quot;Consent Order,&quot; which would include additional terms. The Prices contended\r\n  they discussed the matter with Investors' counsel shortly after sending their\r\n  revocation.Â  Investors' counsel sent a revised &quot;Settlement Agreement and\r\n  Release.&quot;Â  The Prices did not believe the revised agreement was consistent\r\n  with the parties' negotiated terms.Â  In December 2008, Investors filed a\r\n  &quot;Motion for Specific Performance and to Enforce Mediation Agreement.&quot;Â  \r\nSeveral months later, the parties again negotiated,\r\n  with Investors' counsel emailing the Prices, stating: &quot;We are very close\r\n  to being able to confirm whether or not we will be able to settle with you\r\n  under the terms you discussed previously . . . ,&quot; and &quot;Ms. Price: I\r\n  am optimistic that we can agree on all the terms you and I last\r\n  discussed.&quot;Â  Investors' counsel sent a second revised &quot;Settlement\r\n  Agreement and Release.&quot;Â  The Prices argued this revision also failed to\r\n  include the new terms, and the Prices allegedly sent another agreement, which\r\n  Investors rejected.Â  \r\nOn July 27, 2009, the trial court heard arguments on Investors'\r\n  motion to enforce the settlement agreement.Â  The Prices hired counsel, who\r\n  filed a Notice of Appearance in October 2009.Â  The court granted Investors'\r\n  motion and dismissed the Prices' complaint in an order filed December 14, 2009.Â \r\n  The court denied the Prices' motion to alter or amend.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAt issue in this case is\r\n  the interpretation of Rule 43(k), SCRCP.Â  The interpretation of a rule or\r\n  statute is reviewed de novo.Â  Limehouse v. Hulsey, Op. No. 4805 (S.C.\r\n  Ct. App. filed June 2, 2011) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 18 at 26, 37); see Catawba\r\n    Indian Tribe of S.C. v. State, 372 S.C. 519, 524, 642 S.E.2d 751, 753\r\n  (2007) (stating the interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which the\r\n  appellate court is free to decide with no particular deference to the trial\r\n  court).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule 43(k), SCRCP\r\nAt the time this settlement agreement was signed, Rule\r\n  43(k) provided in relevant part:Â  &quot;No agreement between counsel affecting\r\n  the proceedings in an action shall be binding unless reduced to the form of a\r\n  consent order or written stipulation signed by counsel and entered in the\r\n  record, or unless made in open court and noted upon the record.&quot;Â  Rule\r\n  43(k), SCRCP (amended effective April 29, 2009).[2] Â &quot;To be enforceable, settlement agreements must either be entered into the\r\n  court's record or acknowledged in open court and placed upon the record.&quot;Â  Motley v. Williams, 374 S.C. 107, 110, 647 S.E.2d 244, 246 (Ct. App.\r\n  2007).Â  A party can comply with this version of Rule 43(k) in three ways: (1) a\r\n  written stipulation signed and entered into the court record; (2) a consent\r\n  order signed and entered into the court record; or (3) a settlement agreement\r\n  announced in open court and noted upon the record.Â  Lisa J. Hincher, Court\r\n    Strictly Construes Rule 43(k) to Settlement Agreements, 48 S.C. L. Rev. 15,\r\n  19 (1996). Â Â Â \r\nThe Prices first argue the trial court erred in not\r\n  revoking the agreement under Rule 43(k) because the Prices were not represented\r\n  by counsel at the time of the mediation, and the rule only applies to\r\n  agreements between counsel.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nIn Ashfort Corp. v. Palmetto Construction Group,\r\n  Inc., 318 S.C. 492, 493, 458 S.E.2d 533, 534 (1995), the parties advised\r\n  the circuit court the case had been settled.Â  The court dismissed the case.Â  Id.Â \r\n  A dispute arose regarding the terms of the settlement, and the circuit court\r\n  reinstated the case, denying a motion to compel settlement.Â  Id.Â  On\r\n  appeal to the supreme court, the court, sua sponte, &quot;raised the Rule 43(k)\r\n  issue.&quot;Â  Hincher, supra, at 16.Â  The supreme court affirmed, finding\r\n  Rule 43(k) applied even though the settlement agreement was between respondent\r\n  and appellants' insurer, and was merely confirmed by the parties' counsel.Â  Ashfort\r\n    Corp., 318 S.C. at 495, 458 S.E.2d at 535.Â  The court opined:Â  \r\n\r\n  To take such a narrow reading\r\n    of Rule 43(k) would defeat its purpose of preventing disputes such as this\r\n    one.Â  The intent of Rule 43(k) is to require all agreements regarding pending\r\n    litigation to either be announced in open court or to be reduced to a consent\r\n    order or written stipulation and entered.Â  \r\n\r\nId. Â \r\nSeveral years later, in Buckley v. Shealy, 370\r\n  S.C. 317, 322, 635 S.E.2d 76, 78 (2006), the supreme court applied the rule to\r\n  bar the enforcement of a settlement agreement that was signed by the parties.Â \r\n  In Buckley, Husband and Wife engaged in mediation and signed an\r\n  agreement.Â  Id. at 320, 635 S.E.2d at 77.Â  The supreme court concluded:\r\n  &quot;[b]ecause the purported agreement the parties reached following mediation\r\n  was neither entered into the court's record nor acknowledged in open court and\r\n  placed upon the record, Rule 43(k), SCRCP, plainly provides that the agreement\r\n  is unenforceable.&quot;Â  Id. at 322, 635 S.E.2d at 78.Â  Although not\r\n  explicitly discussing the application of Rule 43(k) to agreements signed by the\r\n  parties rather than their attorneys, Buckley indicates that where the\r\n  parties signed the agreement, Rule 43(k) applies.Â  Relying on Ashfort and Buckley, we find Rule 43(k) applies to the settlement agreement\r\n  entered into by the Prices and Investors' counsel.\r\nThe Prices next argue the trial court erred in finding\r\n  the settlement agreement was &quot;a binding agreement between the parties that\r\n  cannot be revoked or voided by a party . . . .&quot;Â  We agree.\r\nIn Farnsworth v. Davis Heating &amp; Air\r\n  Conditioning, Inc., 367 S.C. 634, 636-38, 627 S.E.2d 724, 725-26 (2006),\r\n  the supreme court addressed Rule 43(k) in an action in which one of the parties\r\n  rescinded her agreement prior to the agreement meeting the requirements of Rule\r\n  43(k). Â Farnsworth, through a letter by her attorney, offered to release Davis\r\n  from all liability in a breach of contract and negligence cause of action.Â  Id. at 636, 627 S.E.2d at 725.Â  Davis' attorney accepted the offer by signing the\r\n  letter.Â  Id.Â  Soon thereafter, Farnsworth rescinded the agreement.Â  Id. Â Davis moved to compel Farnsworth to comply with the agreement.Â  Id.Â  In\r\n  reversing the trial court's order granting the motion, the supreme court\r\n  stated:Â  &quot;Rule 43(k) provides that '[n]o agreement . . . shall be binding\r\n  unless' one of the three conditions listed [in the Rule] is met.Â  In other\r\n  words, an agreement is non-binding until a condition is satisfied.Â  Until a\r\n  party is bound, she is entitled to withdraw her assent.&quot;Â  Id. at\r\n  637, 627 S.E.2d at 725 (quoting Rule 43(k), SCRCP).\r\nIn this case, the parties signed the settlement\r\n  agreement on November 20, 2008.Â  The Prices revoked their agreement on November\r\n  26, 2008.Â  Investors filed its motion to compel settlement on December 5,\r\n  2008.Â  Under Farnsworth, we find the settlement agreement was revoked.Â \r\n  Thus, the trial court erred in granting Investors' motion for specific\r\n  performance of the settlement agreement.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Enforceability of the\r\n  Agreement â€“ Meeting of the Minds\r\nThe Prices argue the trial court erred in finding the\r\n  parties had an enforceable agreement when there was evidence the parties never\r\n  had a &quot;meeting of the minds&quot; as to the essential terms of the\r\n  agreement.Â  We decline to address this issue.Â  See Bailey v. S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 388 S.C. 1, 8, 693 S.E.2d 426, 430\r\n  (Ct. App. 2010) (stating that an appellate court need not address remaining\r\n  issues when a decision on a prior issue is dispositive).Â  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order granting\r\n  Investors' motion to compel settlement is reversed, and this case is remanded\r\n  for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\nHUFF, SHORT and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n[2] The rule was amended effective April 29, 2009, adding\r\n  at the end of the sentence quoted: &quot;or reduced to writing and signed by\r\n  the parties and their counsel.&quot;Â  Rule 43(k), SCRCP.Â  This settlement\r\n  agreement was signed November 20, 2008.Â  Thus, the former version of Rule 43(k)\r\n  applies.Â  See Hercules Inc. v. S.C. Tax Comm'n, 274 S.C. 137,\r\n  143, 262 S.E.2d 45, 48 (1980) (stating the general rule is that statutes are to\r\n  be construed prospectively rather than retroactively, absent an express\r\n  provision or a clear legislative intent to the contrary); Graham v.\r\n    Dorchester Cnty. Sch. Dist., 339 S.C. 121, 124, 528 S.E.2d 80, 81-82 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2000) (applying the general rule of prospective and retroactive\r\n  application of statutory law changes by analogy to amendments of rules of civil\r\n  procedure).Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-360","title":"Arata v.

Simrill, of Hilton Head Island,\r\n          for Appellants.\r\n        Brian Charles Pitts, of Hilton Head\r\n          Island, for Respondent.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Madeleine\r\n  and Kenneth Arata (the Aratas) filed this action against Village West Owners'\r\n  Association, Inc. d/b/a Village West Horizontal Property Regime (the Regime) to\r\n  set aside judgment under Rule 60, SCRCP.Â  The Aratas appealed from the\r\n  master-in-equity's order granting the Regime's motion to dismiss.Â  We reverse\r\n  and remand.[1]\r\nFACTS[2]\r\nThe Aratas own a unit in the\r\n  Spinnaker Building in the Regime.Â  In March 2005, the Regime filed a complaint\r\n  against the Aratas for failure to pay an assessment.Â  The Aratas answered,\r\n  admitting they did not pay the assessment.&nbsp; However, they averred the\r\n  Regime's By-Laws prevented the Regime from collecting the assessment.&nbsp; The\r\n  Aratas requested an accounting of settlement proceeds from a lawsuit involving\r\n  construction defects in the Spinnaker building, one of the buildings in the\r\n  Regime.Â  \r\nThe Regime moved for summary\r\n  judgment, explaining it initiated two lawsuits from 1994 to 1997.&nbsp; The\r\n  first suit involved construction-related defects in the Spinnaker\r\n  building.&nbsp; This lawsuit settled for $300,000.&nbsp; The second lawsuit\r\n  involved construction-related defects in the other four buildings within the\r\n  Regime.&nbsp; The second lawsuit settled for $7 million.Â  According to the\r\n  Regime, the total recovery from these suits did not cover the entire expense of\r\n  repairing the buildings.&nbsp; As a result, the Regime's board assessed all of\r\n  the unit owners according to their percentage of ownership in the Regime.&nbsp;\r\n  The Aratas refused to pay this assessment. &nbsp; \r\nThe Aratas opposed the motion\r\n  for summary judgment, arguing the second lawsuit, relating to defects in all of\r\n  the Regime's buildings except the Spinnaker building, resulted in a deficiency.\r\n  Â The Aratas contended the Regime improperly levied the assessment to cover the\r\n  deficiency as to those buildings only.&nbsp; Furthermore, they argued the\r\n  Regime's By-Laws prohibited such an assessment. \r\nThe circuit court granted\r\n  summary judgment to the Regime.Â  The Aratas appealed.Â  In an opinion filed\r\n  January 2007, this court affirmed, finding the Regime's By-Laws and statutory\r\n  authority permitted a pro-rata assessment.Â  On August 24, 2007, while the\r\n  Aratas' petition for certiorari to the supreme court was pending, the Regime's\r\n  attorney notified the Aratas' attorney that he had a box of records relevant to\r\n  Arata 1 &quot;that once was believed to have been lost.&quot;Â  These records were\r\n  not disclosed during the pendency of the action in the circuit court. \r\nOn January 6, 2009, the\r\n  Aratas filed this action alleging fraud, seeking an accounting, and requesting that\r\n  the judgment be set aside under Rule 60, SCRCP.Â  The Aratas alleged the\r\n  Regime's attorney in Arata 1 fraudulently concealed the records.Â  The Regime\r\n  filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) or for judgment on the pleadings\r\n  under Rule 12(c), SCRCP, arguing res judicata prevented the re-litigation of\r\n  the issues.Â  The master granted the motion, finding res judicata applied.[3]Â \r\n  This appeal follows. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn appellate court applies\r\n  the same standard of review as the trial court when reviewing the dismissal of\r\n  an action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) or Rule 12(c), SCRCP. Â See Doe v.\r\n    Marion, 373 S.C. 390, 395, 645 S.E.2d 245, 247 (2007) (discussing the standard\r\n  of review of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP); Hambrick v.\r\n    GMAC Mortg. Corp., 370 S.C. 118, 122, 634 S.E.2d 5, 7 (Ct. App. 2006)\r\n  (discussing the standard of review of a motion for judgment on the pleadings).Â \r\n  A ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion must be based solely on the allegations set\r\n  forth on the face of the complaint.Â  Toussaint v. Ham, 292 S.C. 415,\r\n  416, 357 S.E.2d 8, 9 (1987).Â  When considering a motion for judgment on the\r\n  pleadings under Rule 12(c), SCRCP, the court must regard all properly pleaded factual allegations as admitted.Â  Falk v. Sadler,\r\n  341 S.C. 281, 286-87, 533 S.E.2d 350, 353&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000).Â Â  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Res Judicata\r\nThe Aratas argue the master\r\n  erred in dismissing their complaint based on the doctrine of res judicata.Â  We\r\n  agree. \r\n&quot;Res judicata bars subsequent actions by the same parties when the claims arise out of\r\n  the same transaction or occurrence that was the subject of a prior action between those parties.&quot;Â  Judy v. Judy,\r\n  Op. No. 26987 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed June 20, 2011) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 20 at\r\n  14, 24) (quoting Plum Creek Dev. Co. v. City of Conway, 334 S.C. 30, 34,\r\n  512 S.E.2d 106, 109 (1999)). Â If res judicata applies, a litigant is barred\r\n  from raising any issues which were or might have been adjudicated in the former\r\n  suit.Â  Id.Â  To establish res judicata, the defendant must prove three\r\n  elements: &quot;(1) identity of the parties; (2) identity of the subject\r\n  matter; and (3) adjudication of the issue in the former suit.&quot;Â  Id. at 19 (citing Riedman Corp. v. Greenville Steel Structures, Inc., 308\r\n  S.C. 467, 419 S.E.2d 217 (1992)).Â  \r\nWithout the Aratas' allegation\r\n  of extrinsic fraud amounting to fraud on the court, the Regime is clearly\r\n  entitled to the defense of res judicata, as found by the master.Â  The doctrine\r\n  of res judicata, however, does not bar collateral attack of a judgment based on\r\n  extrinsic fraud.Â  Aaron, 381 S.C. at 592-93, 674 S.E.2d at 486. Â Our\r\n  supreme court reiterated the\r\n  rule that extrinsic fraud is necessary to set aside a judgment based on fraud\r\n  in Chewning v. Ford Motor Company,\r\n  354 S.C. 72, 80, 579 S.E.2d 605, 610 (2003).Â  The court explained the difference between intrinsic and\r\n  extrinsic fraud:Â Â  \r\n\r\n  Extrinsic\r\n    fraud is &quot;fraud that induces a person not to present a case or deprives a\r\n    person of the opportunity to be heard. Â Relief is granted for extrinsic fraud\r\n    on the theory that because the fraud prevented a party from fully exhibiting\r\n    and trying his case, there has never been a real contest before the court on\r\n    the subject matter of the action.&quot; \r\n  Intrinsic\r\n    fraud, on the other hand, is fraud which was presented and considered in the\r\n    trial. Â It is fraud which misleads a court in determining issues and induces\r\n    the court to find for the party perpetrating the fraud. \r\n\r\n\r\n  Id. at 81, 579 S.E.2d at 610 (quoting Hilton\r\n    Head Ctr. of S.C. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 294 S.C. 9, 11, 362 S.E.2d 176, 177\r\n  (1987)).Â  Perjury by a party or a witness, use of forged documents, or failure\r\n  to disclose documents by a party or witness are examples of intrinsic fraud.Â  Id.; Raby Constr., L.L.P. v. Orr, 358 S.C. 10, 21 n.5, 594 S.E.2d 478, 483\r\n  n.5 (2004).Â  However, the subornation of perjury by an attorney and/or the\r\n  intentional concealment of documents by an attorney are actions which\r\n  constitute extrinsic fraud amounting to fraud on the court.Â  Chewning,\r\n  354 S.C. at 82-84, 579 S.E.2d at 610-11.Â  Any claim of fraud on the court must\r\n  be accompanied by particularized allegations.Â  Id. at 86, 579 S.E.2d at\r\n  613.\r\nHere, the Aratas allege the\r\n  Regime's then attorney made fraudulent representations and concealed the lost\r\n  records.Â  In their complaint, the Aratas allege the Regime's attorney &quot;had\r\n  a box of records crammed in a banker's box . . . which had not been disclosed .\r\n  . . .&quot;Â  The Aratas further maintain the attorney, &quot;[b]oth in the\r\n  prosecution of the case in the lower court and on appeal in the Court of\r\n  Appeals,&quot; made representations that were &quot;false, material, known to\r\n  have been false when made, [and] made with the intention that it be acted upon\r\n  by the Aratas . . . .&quot;Â  The trial court found these were not allegations\r\n  of extrinsic fraud.Â  The court stated: &quot;This is not a case where an\r\n  attorney embarked on a scheme to either suborn perjury or intentionally conceal[]\r\n  documents, which, as the Supreme Court indicated in Chewning . . . would\r\n  constitute extrinsic fraud.&quot; \r\nWith the greatest respect for\r\n  the learned master's conclusion, we find the Aratas' complaint does allege\r\n  extrinsic fraud amounting to fraud on the court.Â  Thus, res judicata does not\r\n  bar collateral attack of the Arata 1 judgment.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the\r\n  master's grant of the motion to dismiss based on res judicata. Â Â \r\n\r\nII.&nbsp; Timeliness of Motion to Set\r\n  Aside Judgment\r\nThe\r\n  Regime argues this court should affirm the master's order on the additional\r\n  sustaining ground that the motion for relief from judgment was not made within\r\n  the one-year time limit required under Rule 60(b), SCRCP.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 60(b), SCRCP, reads:Â \r\n  &quot;On motion . . . the court may relieve a party . . .\r\n  from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake,\r\n  inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence . .\r\n  . ; (3) fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party; (4)\r\n  the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied . . . .&quot;Â  Rule\r\n  60(b), SCRCP.Â  The rule\r\n  continues, stating: &quot;The motion shall be made within\r\n  a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after the judgment, order or proceeding was entered or\r\n  taken.&quot; Â Id.Â  Rule 60(b) also provides:\r\n  &quot;This rule does not limit the power of a court to entertain an independent\r\n  action to relieve a party from a judgment, order, or proceeding, or to set\r\n  aside a judgment for fraud upon the court.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe Aratas did not file this\r\n  action until January 6, 2009, well beyond the one-year time required under Rule\r\n  60(b)(1)-(3).Â  The Aratas, however, argue their action is timely because it is\r\n  based on the authority granted in Rule 60(b) allowing an independent action,\r\n  not subject to the one-year limitation, for fraud on the court, or under the\r\n  authority in Rule 60 to hear an independent action for exceptional\r\n  circumstances warranting equitable relief.Â  See Mr. T. v. Ms. T.,\r\n  378 S.C. 127, 135, 662 S.E.2d 413, 417 (Ct. App. 2008) (stating Rule 60 permits\r\n  these two potential independent attacks on a judgment).Â  Our supreme court has explained that while in most circumstances\r\n  there is a time limitation on a party seeking to reopen a final judgment, there\r\n  is no limit when a party seeks to set aside a judgment due to fraud on the\r\n  court.Â  Chewning, 354 S.C. at 80,\r\n  579 S.E.2d at 609-10.Â  \r\nWe find the\r\n  action to set aside the Arata 1 judgment was timely filed because it alleged fraud\r\n  on the court.Â  Therefore, it was not subject to the one-year time limitation of\r\n  Rule 60(b)(3), SCRCP.Â  \r\n\r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other Issues\r\nThe Aratas argue numerous\r\n  other issues including the merits of their allegations of fraud, damages, and\r\n  attorney's fees.Â  We find the appeal of these issues to be premature and,\r\n  therefore, remand them to the master.Â  See Widman v. Widman, 348\r\n  S.C. 97, 125, 557 S.E.2d 693, 708 (Ct. App. 2001) (finding an issue on appeal\r\n  premature and remanding to the family court).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the master's order\r\n  granting the Regime's motion to dismiss and remand for further proceedings in\r\n  accordance with this opinion. \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHUFF, SHORT and PIEPER,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n[2] The background facts are taken from Village West\r\n  Horizontal Property Regime v. Arata, Op. No. 2007-UP-015 (S.C. Ct. App.\r\n  filed Jan. 11, 2007), cert. denied, Oct. 31, 2007.Â  We reference that case\r\n  as &quot;Arata 1.&quot;\r\n[3] The master found the Regime's motion &quot;was not\r\n  directed at the cause of action for an accounting and it remains unaffected by\r\n  this Order.&quot; \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-361","title":"State v.

Wilson, Chief\r\n          Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General\r\n          Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of\r\n          Columbia; Solicitor Scarlett Anne Wilson, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  While\r\n  investigating a potential &quot;open-air&quot; illegal drug market, the\r\n  Charleston Police Department, in conjunction with the Federal Bureau of\r\n  Investigation (FBI), conducted an undercover operation in September of 2007.Â \r\n  On September 17, Investigator Karen Springmeyer, operating undercover, drove to\r\n  an area known as Athens Court.Â  She noticed several &quot;subjects,&quot; one\r\n  of whom told her to pull down a side street.Â  There, a man, allegedly Lloyd\r\n  Wright, approached her vehicle, and she told him she wanted to buy some crack.Â \r\n  The man reached in the car and handed her the drugs, and she paid him $50.00 in\r\n  &quot;marked money&quot; the FBI provided for the the operation.Â  Springmeyer then\r\n  returned to her unit and delivered the crack to Investigator Seabrook, the case\r\n  agent.Â  \r\nThree\r\n  weeks later, Wright was arrested for the drug transaction.Â  The marked money\r\n  was never recovered.Â  Wright was tried for distribution of cocaine base and distribution\r\n  of cocaine base within a close proximity of a school, and he was convicted of\r\n  both charges.Â  The trial court sentenced him to life without the possibility of\r\n  parole.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases an appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State\r\n    v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWright's\r\n  alleges the trial court erred in failing to strike Hurteau's testimony because\r\n  he lacked personal knowledge.Â  We disagree.Â  Wright specifically indicated to\r\n  the trial court that the basis for his objection was Rule 612, SCRE, which\r\n  provides the following:\r\n\r\n  If a witness uses a writing to refresh\r\n    memory for the purpose of testifying, eitherâ€”\r\n  (1) while testifying, or\r\n  (2) before testifying, if the court\r\n    in its discretion determines it is necessary in the interests of justice, an\r\n    adverse party is entitled to have the writing produced at the hearing, to\r\n    inspect it, to cross-examine the witness thereon, and to introduce in evidence those\r\n    portions which relate to the testimony of the witness. If it is claimed that\r\n    the writing contains matters not related to the subject matter of the testimony\r\n    the court shall examine the writing in camera, excise any portions not so\r\n    related, and order delivery of the remainder to the party entitled thereto. Any\r\n    portion withheld over objections shall be preserved and made available to the\r\n    appellate court in the event of an appeal. If a writing is not produced or\r\n    delivered pursuant to order under this rule, the court shall make any order\r\n    justice requires, except that in criminal cases when the prosecution elects not\r\n    to comply, the order shall be one striking the testimony or, if the court in\r\n    its discretion determines that the interests of justice so require, declaring a\r\n    mistrial.\r\n\r\nHere,\r\n  the trial court permitted, and the State did not prevent, Springmeyer's and\r\n  Seabrook's reports to be marked as exhibits and allowed Wright the opportunity\r\n  to review the documents and cross-examine Hurteau on them.Â  Accordingly, we see\r\n  no grounds to allege error under Rule 612.[1]\r\nWright\r\n  further argues the State violated Rule 5, SCRCrimP,[2] and Brady v. Maryland[3] in failing to provide a copy of the &quot;operational plan.&quot;Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 5 provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  Upon request of the defendant the\r\n    prosecution shall permit the defendant to inspect and copy books, papers,\r\n    documents, photographs, tangible objects ... which are within the possession,\r\n    custody or control of the prosecution, and which are material to the preparation\r\n    of his defense or are intended for use by the prosecution as evidence in chief\r\n    at the trial[] . . . .\r\n\r\nRule\r\n  5(a)(1)(C), SCRCrimP.\r\nSimilarly, Brady holds that &quot;the suppression by the prosecution of evidence\r\n  favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is\r\n  material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or\r\n  bad faith of the prosecution.&quot;Â  373 U.S. at 87.Â  To establish such a due\r\n  process violation, an accused must demonstrate &quot;(1) the evidence was\r\n  favorable to the accused, (2) it was in the possession of or known to the\r\n  prosecution, (3) it was suppressed by the prosecution, and (4) it was material\r\n  to guilt or punishment.&quot;Â  State v. Gibson, 334 S.C. 515, 524, 514\r\n  S.E.2d 320, 324 (1999) (footnote omitted).Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  the State argued it neither had knowledge of nor possession of such a plan.Â \r\n  Likewise, the trial court found there had been no showing the operational plan\r\n  was in the State's possession, the State had suppressed it, or the State failed\r\n  to disclose it.Â  The evidence supports these findings.Â  Similarly, nothing in\r\n  the record supports Wright's contention that the document, which Hurteau\r\n  testified was for the purpose of protecting the public, the officers, and the\r\n  suspects during the investigation, was material or exculpatory.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the trial court did not err.\r\nWright\r\n  lastly argues the drug evidence should have been suppressed because the State\r\n  failed to properly establish the chain of custody.Â  We disagree. Â &quot;[A] party\r\n  offering into evidence fungible items such as drugs or blood samples must\r\n  establish a complete chain of custody as far as practicable.&quot;Â  State v. Sweet,\r\n  374 S.C. 1, 6, 647, S.E.2d 202, 205 (2007).Â  The determination of whether the\r\n  State has established the chain of custody as far as practicable depends on the\r\n  unique facts of each case.Â  State v. Hatcher, Op. No. 26950 (S.C. Sup.\r\n  Ct. filed Mar. 21, 2011) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 10 at 82-83).Â  &quot;Testimony\r\n  from each custodian of fungible evidence . . . is not a prerequisite to\r\n  establish a chain of custody sufficient for admissibility.&quot; Sweet,\r\n  374 S.C. at 7, 647 S.E.2d at 206 (citing State v. Taylor, 360 S.C. 18,\r\n  27, 598 S.E.2d 735, 739 (Ct. App. 2004)).Â  &quot;Where other evidence establishes\r\n  the identity of those who have handled the evidence and reasonably demonstrates\r\n  the manner of handling of the evidence, our courts have been willing to fill\r\n  gaps in the chain of the custody due to an absent witness.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;[W]here\r\n  all individuals in the chain are, in fact, identified and the manner of\r\n  handling is reasonably demonstrated, it is not an abuse of discretion for the\r\n  trial judge to admit the evidence in the absence of proof of tampering, bad\r\n  faith or ill-motive.&quot;Â  Hatcher, Op. No. 26950, at 81.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, the essence of Wright's argument is (1) Seabrook failed to sign the\r\n  evidence sheet and as a result Wright was unaware Seabrook was in the chain of\r\n  custody until the time of trial and (2) Joe Lelama, the evidence technician who\r\n  signed the evidence into the evidence room, did not testify.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, although Seabrook forgot to sign the evidence sheet, he testified\r\n  that he delivered the evidence in a sealed package to the Charleston Police\r\n  Department's evidence lock box.Â  Similarly, although Lelama did not testify,\r\n  Hinton testified that Lelema received the evidence on September 20, 2007, based\r\n  on his recognition of Lelama's initials on the property sheet and evidence\r\n  tag.Â  Then, Susan Moody testified she retrieved the evidence from the evidence\r\n  room, signed it out, and transported it to the laboratory for analysis.Â \r\n  Finally, laboratory manager Elizabeth Wiggins-Mitchell testified she received\r\n  the sealed evidence bags, tested the evidence, determined it was cocaine base,\r\n  and replaced it into a new sealed container bearing her initials.Â  Moreover,\r\n  she identified this sealed container, which bore her initials, in court.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting\r\n  the evidence.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  ruling of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW,\r\n  C.J., THOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Wright argues\r\n  Hurteau's testimony should also have been striken under Rule 602, SCRE.Â \r\n  Notwithstanding that Wright specifically clarified to the trial court the basis\r\n  for his objection was Rule 612, the trial court noted that Hurteau had personal\r\n  knowledge by virtue of being at the scene during the controlled buy.Â  We agree\r\n  and note that any defect in his memory was for the jury to weigh.Â  \r\n[2]Â  We note that although Wright did not make a precise\r\n  objection based on Rule 5, at the outset of his motion before the trial court\r\n  he did note that the operational plan &quot;was not provided in discovery[] . .\r\n  . [and that he] believe[d] it was discoverable.&quot;Â  \r\n[3] 373 U.S. 83 (1963).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-364","title":"Ugino v.

Breibart, of Lexington, for\r\n          Appellant.\r\n        James Edward Bradley, of W. Columbia, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In\r\n  this action for breach of contract and other claims arising from a failed real\r\n  estate transaction, Michael R. and Donna S. Ugino appeal the grant of summary\r\n  judgment to Carl W. Peter.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\n1. Â The Uginos argue\r\n  Peter's summary judgment motion addressed only their contract claims and the\r\n  trial judge therefore should not have dismissed their tort claims as well.Â  We disagree\r\n  with these assertions.Â  Peter's summary judgment motion was not restricted to\r\n  any particular cause of action asserted by the Uginos.Â  Furthermore, the motion\r\n  was based in part on the failure of the financing condition in the contract.Â \r\n  An absence of a genuine issue of material fact concerning this ground would\r\n  absolve Peter of not only the breach of contract claim but also of the Uginos'\r\n  claim for breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act.Â  See Connor\r\n    v. City of Forest Acres, 348 S.C. 454, 465, 560 S.E.2d 606, 612 (2002)\r\n  (stating that one of the elements for a claim of breach of contract accompanied\r\n  by a fraudulent act is a breach of contract).Â  The Uginos' fraud and negligence\r\n  causes of action arose from Peter's agreement to purchase their home, an\r\n  agreement that was ultimately excused under the provisions of the parties'\r\n  contract by the failure of the financing condition, a circumstance that was not\r\n  anticipated when the contract was made. Â See Koontz v. Thomas,\r\n  333 S.C. 702, 713, 511 S.E.2d 407, 413 (Ct. App. 1999) (stating a negligent\r\n  misrepresentation &quot;must relate to a present or pre-existing fact and be\r\n  false when made&quot;).Â  Likewise, the gravamen of the Uginos' civil conspiracy\r\n  claim was Peter's refusal to perform under the contract, a refusal Peter\r\n  asserted was based on the parties' agreement and Wachovia's rejection of his\r\n  financing application. Â Given these circumstances, we hold the trial judge\r\n  correctly considered all causes of action asserted by the Uginos in their\r\n  complaint when he determined that Peter was entitled to summary judgment.Â  See Camp v. Camp, 386 S.C. 571, 575-76, 689 S.E.2d 634, 636 (2010) (holding\r\n  that the particularity requirement of Rule 7(b)(1), SCRCP is to be read\r\n  flexibly in light of the circumstances of each case and should not be applied in\r\n  an overly technical fashion when doing so would not serve the purpose behind\r\n  the rule).\r\n2.Â  The Uginos\r\n  argue the trial judge erred in holding Peter's performance under the contract\r\n  was excused because of Peter's inability to obtain financing for his purchase\r\n  of their home.Â  They base their argument on the absence of any provision in the\r\n  contract stating that Peter needed to secure financing for one hundred percent\r\n  of the purchase price and cite a provision in the contract indicating the\r\n  amount to be financed and the amount to be paid down at closing were &quot;to\r\n  be determined.&quot;Â  The Uginos have correctly described these particular\r\n  contract terms; however, we disagree that these terms are sufficient to prevent\r\n  the grant of summary judgment.Â  Although the contract may not have required\r\n  Peter to obtain financing for the entire contract price, it was contingent on both\r\n  Peter's ability to obtain a mortgage from &quot;the lender of his choice&quot; and &quot;the Property appraising, according to the Lender's appraisal or other\r\n  appraisal as agreed, for the selling price or more.&quot;Â  Here, Peter's chosen\r\n  lender did not appraise the property &quot;for the selling price or\r\n  more.&quot;Â  Although, as the Uginos note in their reply brief, Peter himself\r\n  commissioned an appraisal that indicated the value of the subject property\r\n  exceeded the contract price, he did not &quot;agree&quot; to this appraisal and\r\n  there is no evidence that he acted unreasonably in rejecting it.Â  See M&amp;M\r\n    Group v. Holmes, 379 S.C. 468, 476, 666 S.E.2d 262, 266 (Ct. App. 2008)\r\n  (indicating that the force and effect of a legal instrument is to be determined\r\n  from the language in the instrument if the language is plain, unambiguous, and\r\n  capable of only one interpretation).\r\n3.Â  Finally, the\r\n  Uginos contend that other lenders would have provided financing for one hundred\r\n  percent of the purchase price and that Peter therefore violated an implied\r\n  covenant of good faith and fair dealing in refusing to avail himself of these\r\n  possibilities.Â  We disagree.Â  See Adams v. G.J. Creel &amp; Sons,\r\n  320 S.C. 274, 277, 465 S.E.2d 84, 85 (1995) (acknowledging that &quot;[t]here\r\n  exists in every contract an implied covenant of good faith and fair\r\n  dealing,&quot; but also stating &quot;there is no breach of an implied covenant\r\n  of good faith where a party to a contract has done what provisions of the\r\n  contract expressly gave him the right to do&quot;).Â  Here, Peter's contractual\r\n  obligations were set forth in the parties' agreement, which further provided\r\n  that his purchase of the Uginos' home was contingent on a condition precedent\r\n  that was not met.Â  Peter applied for financing from the lender of his choice,\r\n  as the contract required him to do.Â  When the lender he chose appraised the\r\n  property for less than the selling price, Peter was not required to complete\r\n  the sale.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-365","title":"Strickland v.

Code Ann. Â§ 37-2-407 (2002)\r\n  (providing in a consumer credit sale, the seller &quot;may take a security\r\n  interest in the property sold&quot;); S.C. Code Ann.
