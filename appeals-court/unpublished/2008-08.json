Goodstein, Circuit Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2008-UP-432\r\nHeard May 7, 2008 â€“ Filed August 4, 2008\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tAndrew F. Lindemann, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tDavid Whittington, of Summerville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  In this personal injury\r\n  action, the South Carolina Department of Transportation appeals a verdict for Plaintiff\r\n  Jeffery R. Hart.Â  The questions presented in this appeal are: Â (1) whether the\r\n  Department was entitled to claim sovereign immunity under the South Carolina\r\n  Tort Claims Act; and (2) whether the trial judge erred in directing a verdict\r\n  on the Departmentâ€™s defense of comparative negligence.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nHart was employed as\r\n  a senior patrol officer by the Town of Holly Hill.Â  On December 1, 2002, Hart\r\n  began his patrol shift around 9:00 p.m., expecting to work until seven oâ€™clock\r\n  the following morning.Â  During the early morning hours of his shift, Hart\r\n  observed a vehicle stop at two residences one block apart from each other.Â  At\r\n  both stops, the driver of the car hastily exited the vehicle and quickly\r\n  approached the house.Â  When he observed the vehicle make a left turn without a\r\n  turn signal, Hart instructed another officer on duty in the vicinity to\r\n  initiate a traffic stop.Â  In addition, because of the behavior of the driver,\r\n  Hart wanted â€œto make sure everything was still going to be okay with the person.â€\r\nThe officer whom Hart had instructed to initiate the\r\n  traffic stop informed Hart by radio that the vehicle did not pull over after\r\n  activation of the blue light.Â  When Hart heard the siren in the background, he\r\n  activated the blue light and siren on his own vehicle and joined in the\r\n  pursuit.\r\nDuring the pursuit,\r\n  Hart observed the vehicles of both the suspect and the accompanying officer\r\n  stop at two stop signs.Â  Furthermore, neither vehicle ran any stop signs.Â  After\r\n  the suspect feigned a stop, the vehicle Hart was driving became the primary car\r\n  behind the suspectâ€™s vehicle.\r\nBecause\r\n  Hart had never been on the road on which the suspect was leading him, he asked\r\n  the Orangeburg County dispatch if there was a deputy in the area.Â  At no time\r\n  did either Hartâ€™s vehicle or the suspectâ€™s vehicle ever exceed eighty miles per\r\n  hour.[1]Â \r\n  Throughout the pursuit, Hart maintained a following distance of about six to\r\n  eight car lengths.\r\nThe paved, straight road on which the two vehicles\r\n  were proceeding dead-ended into a dirt road; however, there was no stop sign at\r\n  the intersection.Â  The suspect did not stop at the intersection, which caused\r\n  her vehicle to go airborne into the woods, resulting in fatal injuries.Â \r\n  Similarly, Hart was unable to stop or take other evasive action and sustained\r\n  bodily injuries when his vehicle crashed into the same wooded area. Â Hart\r\n  estimated both vehicles were traveling at a speed of seventy-two miles per hour\r\n  when they reached the intersection.\r\nOn November 10,\r\n  2004, Hart commenced this action under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act\r\n  against the Department, alleging the Department was negligent in failing to\r\n  have appropriate signage at the intersection. Â In its answer, dated January 19,\r\n  2005, the Department denied the allegations in the complaint and made the\r\n  following assertions as affirmative defenses: Â (1) the acts or omissions of\r\n  third parties not within its control superseded and intervened to such an\r\n  extent as to negate any effect of its own negligence; (2) punitive damages were\r\n  not recoverable; (3) the acts or omissions allegedly constituting negligence\r\n  were not actionable because they resulted from the exercise of discretion or\r\n  judgment; (4) Hartâ€™s own negligence barred any recovery; and (5) the Department\r\n  was entitled to â€œany defense under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act, S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-10 et seq. not already pled above.â€\r\nA jury trial in the\r\n  matter took place on January 9, 2006.Â  At the close of Hartâ€™s case and again at\r\n  the close of its own case, the Department moved for a directed verdict on the\r\n  following three grounds:Â  (1) Hart failed to prove the Department had actual or\r\n  constructive notice of the missing stop sign; (2) Hartâ€™s negligence was greater\r\n  than 50 percent and he should not recover under comparative negligence law; and\r\n  (3) Hartâ€™s sole remedy was through the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation\r\n  Act.Â  The trial judge rejected all three grounds and denied the motion.\r\nHart also moved for directed verdicts on the issue of\r\n  liability and on the Departmentâ€™s comparative negligence defense.Â  Although the\r\n  trial judge submitted the issue of liability to the jury, she directed a\r\n  verdict for Hart on the issue of comparative negligence, thus striking that\r\n  defense.\r\nThe\r\n  jury returned a verdict in Hartâ€™s favor in the amount of $1,000,000.Â  The\r\n  Department then filed post-trial motions for judgment notwithstanding the\r\n  verdict (JNOV), for a new trial absolute, and to alter or amend the judgment.Â  By\r\n  order dated April 6, 2006, the trial judge granted the Departmentâ€™s motion to\r\n  alter or amend the judgment, reducing the verdict to $300,000 in accordance\r\n  with the South Carolina Tort Claims Act, but denied the Departmentâ€™s other\r\n  motions.Â  Specifically, the trial judge found the Department had constructive\r\n  notice â€œbecause [it] was under a continuing duty to check the intersection\r\n  bi-monthly or six (6) times a year, plus a night inspection annually.â€Â  The\r\n  trial judge also found there was no evidence that Hart was negligent under the\r\n  circumstances of the case.Â  Finally, the trial judge rejected the Departmentâ€™s\r\n  claim that the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act was Hartâ€™s only remedy.\r\n  Â This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe trial court is required to view the evidence and reasonably\r\n  drawn inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party when\r\n  ruling on motions for directed verdict and JNOV.Â  Jinks v. Richland County, 355 S.C. 341, 345, 585 S.E.2d 281, 283 (2003).Â  The court should deny the\r\n  motion when the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in\r\n  doubt.Â  Id.Â  â€œThe appellate court\r\n  will reverse the trial courtâ€™s ruling on a JNOV motion only when there is no\r\n  evidence to support the ruling or where the ruling is\r\n  controlled by an error of law.â€Â  Law v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 368 S.C.\r\n  424, 434-435, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648 (2006) (citing Hinkle v. Natâ€™l Cas. Ins. Co., 354 S.C. 92, 96, 579 S.E.2d 616, 618 (2003)).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  The\r\n  Department asserts the trial judge should have ruled it was entitled to protection\r\n  from liability under section 15-78-60(14) of the South Carolina Tort Claims\r\n  Act.Â  We find no reversible error.\r\nIn her\r\n  post-trial order, the trial judge gave three reasons for rejecting the\r\n  Departmentâ€™s argument that Hartâ€™s sole remedy for his injuries was through the\r\n  South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act:Â  (1) the issue had not been properly\r\n  raised to the court; (2) South Carolina Code section 15-78-60(14) did not bar\r\n  Hart from pursuing a personal injury claim against the Department because he\r\n  â€œwas employed by the Town of Holly Hill, not by the State or the South Carolina\r\n  Department of Transportationâ€; and (3) even if section 15-78-60(14) were\r\n  applicable, Hart could still recover against the Department under the dual\r\n  persona doctrine because he was suing the Department for breach of duties that\r\n  were wholly independent of any owed to him as an employee of the Town of Holly\r\n  Hill.Â  A decision by this Court to uphold any one of these three grounds is\r\n  sufficient to affirm the trial judgeâ€™s determination that Hart was not limited\r\n  to recovery under the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act for his injuries.Â  See Weeks v. McMillan, 291 S.C. 287, 292, 353 S.E.2d 289, 292\r\n  (Ct. App. 1987) (â€œWhere a decision is based on alternative grounds, either of\r\n  which independent of the other is sufficient to support it, the decision will\r\n  not be reversed even if one of the grounds is erroneous.â€).\r\nWe\r\n  agree with the trial judge that the issue of whether the Department was immune\r\n  from liability under section 15-78-60(14) was not properly presented to the\r\n  trial court.\r\nUnder\r\n  the South Carolina Tort Claims Act, â€œ[t]he State, an agency, a\r\n  political subdivision, and a governmental entity are liable for their torts in\r\n  the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like\r\n  circumstancesâ€ subject to limitations and exemptions from liability and damages\r\n  as provided within the Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-40 (2005).Â  One such\r\n  exception to the waiver of immunity is contained within section 15-78-60(14).Â \r\n  That section provides in pertinent part that â€œ[t]he governmental entity is not\r\n  liable for a loss resulting from . . . any claim covered by the South Carolina\r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, except claims by or on behalf of an injured employee\r\n  to recover damages from any person other than the employer . . . .â€Â  Id. Â§ 15-78-60(14).Â  As with other limitations on liability under the Act, however,\r\n  the burden of establishing this exception is on the governmental entity\r\n  asserting it as an affirmative defense.Â  Clark v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Pub.\r\n    Safety, 362 S.C. 377, 386, 608 S.E.2d 573, 578 (2005).Â  Moreover, as an\r\n  affirmative defense, this exception â€œmust be specifically pled to be considered.â€Â \r\n  61A Am. Jur. 2d Pleading Â§ 295 (1999).Â  See also 71 C.J.S. Pleading Â§ 198 (2000) (â€œA plea or answer setting up new matter as a defense generally\r\n  must contain a statement of facts and should be certain and precise.â€).\r\nEven if we were to\r\n  accept the Departmentâ€™s argument in its reply brief that the question of\r\n  whether Hartâ€™s accident was covered under the South Carolina Workersâ€™\r\n  Compensation Act was a matter of law, we share the trial judgeâ€™s concern\r\n  regarding how the Department attempted to raise this issue.Â  In its answer, the\r\n  Department made only a nonspecific reference to â€œany defense under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act\r\n  . . . not already pled above.â€Â  At no time during this litigation did the Department expressly assert section 15-78-60(14) as an\r\n  affirmative defense or as a ground for summary judgment.Â  Moreover,\r\n  although Rule 15(b) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure allows\r\n  pleadings to be amended as necessary to conform to the evidence, here there was\r\n  nothing in the record before us on which to base an amendment of the\r\n  Departmentâ€™s answer to include the specific affirmative defense that it was\r\n  entitled to immunity because Hartâ€™s claim should have been covered by workersâ€™\r\n  compensation.[2]\r\nUnder\r\n  these circumstances, we do not fault the trial judge for her reservations about\r\n  deciding this issue.Â  Absent from the record is any indication before its\r\n  directed verdict motion that the Department ever intended to rely on section\r\n  15-78-60(14) as an affirmative defense.Â  Cf. Turner v. Cent. Local\r\n    Sch. Dist., 706 N.E.2d 1261, 1264 (Ohio 1999) (reversing the grant of the\r\n  defendant school districtâ€™s motion to include a statutory immunity defense in\r\n  part because the district failed to assert the defense in a timely manner and\r\n  its failure to do so made it reasonable for the plaintiffs to assume the\r\n  defense would be waived).\r\n2.Â  The Department also\r\n  contends the trial judge erred in directing a verdict on its defense that Hart\r\n  was negligent, thus preventing the jury from apportioning fault on the basis of\r\n  Hartâ€™s alleged comparative negligence.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder South\r\n  Carolina Code section 56-5-760, the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle\r\n  may â€œexceed the maximum speed limit if he does not endanger life or propertyâ€\r\n  when appropriate audible and visual signals on the vehicle are activated.Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-760(B)(3) (2006).Â  This section further provides that its\r\n  protections â€œdo not relieve the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle from\r\n  the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons.â€Â  Id. Â§ 56-5-760(D).Â  \r\nOn appeal, the\r\n  Department contends Hart failed to exercise due care for his own safety by (1)\r\n  pursuing a traffic offender at an excessive rate of speed in the dark and in an\r\n  area with which he was unfamiliar; (2) following the lead vehicle too closely\r\n  and failing to maintain a proper lookout; and (3) failing to terminate the\r\n  search according to the Holly Hill Police Policy and Procedure for police\r\n  pursuits.Â  We agree with the trial judge that none of these grounds gave rise\r\n  to an inference Hart was negligent.\r\nWe acknowledge that\r\n  the pursuit took place at night and that Hart admitted he had exceeded the\r\n  posted speed limit and did not know the area.Â  Nevertheless, it was also\r\n  undisputed that the weather conditions were good and the road on which both\r\n  vehicles were traveling was straight and paved.Â  Moreover, there was no evidence\r\n  that the same accident would not have occurred even if Hart was traveling the\r\n  speed limit.Â  See Horton v. Greyhound, 241 S.C. 430, 439, 128\r\n  S.E.2d 776, 781 (1962) (â€œThe concurrence of excessive\r\n  speed with this primary, efficient cause of the collision does not impose\r\n  liability on the defendants unless, without it, the collision would not have\r\n  occurred.â€).\r\nAs to\r\n  the Departmentâ€™s allegations that Hart followed the suspect vehicle too\r\n  closely, the only pertinent evidence is Hartâ€™s testimony that he maintained a\r\n  following distance of approximately six to eight car lengths consistent with\r\n  his training.Â  Furthermore, the only evidence regarding whether Hart kept a\r\n  proper lookout was his testimony on cross-examination that, contrary to what\r\n  the Department was trying to establish, his attention was not focused exclusively\r\n  on the suspect vehicle.Â  There is no evidence that either Hart or the suspect\r\n  had driven erratically.Â  As noted earlier in this opinion, both vehicles had\r\n  stopped at stop signs twice during the pursuit.\r\nFinally, we\r\n  reject the Departmentâ€™s assertion that Hart should have ended the pursuit.Â  Regardless\r\n  of whether written procedures warranted termination of the pursuit, the trial\r\n  judge found â€œ[t]here was no evidence otherwise presented that [Hart] should\r\n  have abandoned his pursuit due to the endangerment of life or property.â€ Â Although,\r\n  as the Department noted in its brief, Hart admitted he would have terminated\r\n  the pursuit for safety reasons if it had continued on the dirt road\r\n  intersecting the road on which both vehicles were traveling just before the\r\n  accident, the pursuit ended while both vehicles were still on the paved road\r\n  and crashed into the woods. Â We have found no evidence in the recordâ€”and the\r\n  Department has not directed our attention to anyâ€”of hazards appearing before\r\n  the accident that should have prompted Hart to discontinue the pursuit.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  THOMAS, and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The posted speed limit on the road was fifty-five\r\n  miles per hour.\r\n[2]Â  The trial judge observed the record was â€œcompletely\r\n  void as to any evidence of [Hartâ€™s] entitlement to benefits under the South\r\n  Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act,â€ and, when arguing his directed verdict\r\n  motion, counsel for the Department conceded â€œthereâ€™s no evidence in the record\r\n  in the workersâ€™ compensation claim.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-433","title":"Edwards v.

Epps, Jr., of Anderson, for Appellant-Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\tRobert M. Rosenfeld, of Greenville, for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In\r\n  this domestic action, Frances Edwards (Wife) appeals the family courtâ€™s order\r\n  reducing alimony payments of Douglas\r\n  Edwards (Husband).Â  Husband cross-appeals arguing the family\r\n  court erred in finding him in contempt, imposing a contempt sanction, awarding\r\n  Wife attorneyâ€™s fees, and allowing evidence of previous testimony.Â  Husband\r\n  also contends a state court lacks jurisdiction, outside the realm of alimony, to interfere with repayment\r\n  of his debts pursuant to Chapter 13 bankruptcy.Â  We affirm the reduction in\r\n  alimony and hold the remaining issues in abeyance due to Husbandâ€™s bankruptcy\r\n  action.[1] \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were married in 1966.Â  In 2000, Wife filed for\r\n  divorce.Â  The family court granted Wife a divorce on the ground of adultery and\r\n  awarded Wife $1,673 per month in regular periodic alimony.Â  Prior to the\r\n  divorce hearing, Husband and Wife had reached a settlement agreement involving\r\n  the equitable division of their real and personal property through two letters\r\n  between counsel.Â  The family court approved\r\n  this settlement agreement and merged and incorporated these letters by reference into the\r\n  divorce order.Â  This agreement involved\r\n  the equitable division of a family business, Central Catering and CafÃ© (the\r\n  CafÃ©), and a business vehicle\r\n  owned by the CafÃ©.Â  \r\nAfter their divorce, Husband accepted a severance package and\r\n  retired from his job with Michelin in 2002.Â  Thereafter, he began\r\n  focusing entirely on the CafÃ© and wished to expand the business.Â  However,\r\n  after losing a longtime lease, Husband began losing money in the CafÃ©.Â \r\n  Additionally, Arvidiaâ€™s Deli, an expansion restaurant Husband opened, failed a\r\n  year after its opening.Â  Based on these events, Husband petitioned the family\r\n  court for a reduction in his alimony obligation.Â  Wife counterclaimed, arguing\r\n  Husbandâ€™s changed circumstances did not warrant a reduction in his alimony\r\n  obligation and sought immediate payment of all equitably divided marital\r\n  property.Â  Additionally, Wife alleged Husband was in willful contempt of court\r\n  for his failure to pay Wife her portion of their marital estate pursuant to the\r\n  original divorce decree.Â  \r\nOn June 6, 2005, the family court issued an order reducing\r\n  Husbandâ€™s monthly alimony obligation from $1,673 to $400 based on his changed\r\n  circumstances.Â  The family court also found Husband in contempt for failing to\r\n  pay Wife her share of the marital property, Cobra benefits, and attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n  and costs pursuant to the original divorce decree.Â  The family court ordered\r\n  Husband to pay Wife $34,411.77 within 30 days, and if he failed to pay, to\r\n  serve 90 days in the Greenville County Detention Center.Â  Additionally, the\r\n  family court ordered Husband to pay Wife $7,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees which Wife\r\n  incurred during the contempt case.Â  \r\nHusband unsuccessfully sought a stay of the contempt order from\r\n  the family court and this court.Â  He subsequently filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy.Â \r\n  The federal bankruptcy court established a payment schedule under which Husband\r\n  would pay back his creditors, including paying debts he owed to Wife.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn\r\n  appeal from a family court order, the appellate court has authority to correct\r\n  errors of law and find facts in accordance with our own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 473, 415\r\n  S.E.2d 812, 814 (1992).Â  However, â€œ[q]uestions concerning alimony rest with the\r\n  sound discretion of the [family] court, whose conclusions will not be disturbed\r\n  absent a showing of abuse of discretion.â€Â  Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C.\r\n  481, 485, 477 S.E.2d 727, 729 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The family\r\n  court abuses its discretion when factual findings are without evidentiary\r\n  support or a ruling is based upon an error of law. Â Smith v. Doe, 366\r\n  S.C. 469, 474, 623 S.E.2d 370, 372 (2005).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Wifeâ€™s Appeal\r\nA.Â \r\n  Modification of Alimony \r\nWife argues Husband\r\n  has not proved a substantial change in circumstances has occurred such that a\r\n  reduction in alimony is warranted.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  party seeking the change in alimony has the burden to prove an unforeseen\r\n  change in circumstances warrants a modification.Â  Kelley v. Kelley, 324\r\n  S.C. 481, 486, 477 S.E.2d 727, 729 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œSeveral considerations\r\n  relevant to the initial determination of alimony may be applied in the\r\n  modification context as well, including the partiesâ€™ standard of living during\r\n  the marriage, each partyâ€™s earning capacity, and the supporting spouseâ€™s\r\n  ability to continue to support the other spouse.â€Â  Penny v. Green, 357\r\n  S.C. 583, 589, 594 S.E.2d 171, 174 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court has emphasized it, â€œwill closely scrutinize the\r\n  facts of any case wherein a husband and father voluntarily changes employment\r\n  so as to lessen his earning capacity . . . .â€ Â Camp v. Camp, 269 S.C.\r\n  173, 174, 236 S.E.2d 814, 815 (1977).Â  The Camp court held, â€œWhere the\r\n  husband has voluntarily relinquished a well-paying practice and has taken a\r\n  position at a modest salary, the court may base the amount of alimony upon his\r\n  capacity to earn money, or upon his prospective earnings.â€Â  269 S.C. at 175,\r\n  236 S.E.2d at 815.Â  Recently, the South Carolina Supreme Court held the motive\r\n  behind a reduction in income may be a factor when courts consider earning\r\n  capacity.Â  Arnal v. Arnal, 371 S.C. 10, 13, 636 S.E.2d 864, 866 (2006).Â \r\n  The court held the party â€œseeking to impute income to the other [party] need\r\n  not establish a bad faith motivation to lower a support obligation in order to\r\n  prove voluntary underemployment. The presence of bad faith is a factor in\r\n  determining whether a [party] is voluntarily underemployed, but the lack of\r\n  such bad faith does not preclude a finding of voluntary underemployment.â€[2] Â Id.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the present case, the family court found Husband proved a substantial change in\r\n  circumstances warranting a reduction in alimony from $1,673 to $400 per month.Â \r\n  Husbandâ€™s substantial change in circumstances occurred after he terminated his\r\n  employment with Michelin at the age of fifty-eight.Â  In September of 2001,\r\n  Michelin sought to reduce its workforce and expenses.Â  Specifically, Michelin\r\n  sought to reduce $275 million from their budget over a three-year span.Â \r\n  Husband testified his best option was to take an early retirement package\r\n  Michelin offered and retire in 2002.Â  Husband made this decision based on his\r\n  knowledge of events taking place at Michelin in addition to events happening in\r\n  his own department.Â  Husband was making $54,000 per year at the time of the\r\n  divorce.Â  However, the family court attributed this salary to Husbandâ€™s length\r\n  of service at Michelin, rather than his earning capacity in the job market.Â \r\n  The family court stated Husband was â€œunder qualified to earn what he was\r\n  earning, but for his years of service.â€Â  \r\nIn\r\n  addition to his severance package of eleven months pay, Husband received\r\n  retirement benefits and sought to increase profits of the CafÃ©, his existing\r\n  business.Â  Husband also wished to expand this business by opening a deli.Â \r\n  After retiring from Michelin, unforeseen events caused Husbandâ€™s income to\r\n  diminish.Â  First, the CafÃ© was forced to relocate because Husband lost his\r\n  lease.Â  Under the CafÃ©â€™s new lease, monthly rent increased from $200 to\r\n  $1,251.Â  In addition, Husbandâ€™s restaurant expansion, the Arvidia Deli, failed\r\n  a year after opening.Â  We note Husband was legitimately concerned that he may\r\n  have been fired if he had rejected Michelinâ€™s severance package.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  Husbandâ€™s loss of the CafÃ©â€™s lease and his unsuccessful business venture with\r\n  the Deli were all unforeseen and unanticipated changes in market conditions.Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on these unforeseen changed circumstances, we find the family court did not\r\n  abuse its discretion in reducing Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation based on the\r\n  above evidence and its finding that Husband made an â€œexcellent effortâ€ to\r\n  supplement his income.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the family courtâ€™s decision to\r\n  reduce alimony.Â  \r\nB.Â \r\n  Amount of Alimony Reduction\r\nAlternatively, Wife\r\n  argues the family court erred in determining the amount of Husbandâ€™s reduced\r\n  alimony obligation.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe family court\r\n  initially ordered Husband to pay $1,673 per month in alimony to Wife after\r\n  finding Husband earned $4,516 in gross monthly income from his job with\r\n  Michelin, with a net monthly income of $2,915 after deductions.Â  Additionally\r\n  in the divorce decree, the family court found Husband earned a profit of\r\n  $29,884.55 from the CafÃ© during the first ten months of 2000.Â  At that time,\r\n  the family court considered Husbandâ€™s two potential sources of income in its\r\n  determination of alimony payments. Â \r\nIn\r\n  considering Husbandâ€™s request to decrease his alimony obligation, the family\r\n  court recognized he is no longer receiving $4,516.00 in gross monthly income from\r\n  his job with Michelin.Â  Additionally, the family court recognized â€œthat a\r\n  business [Husband] established, known as Arvidiaâ€™s [D]eli, has now failed and\r\n  he no longer has sufficient funds with which to pay his alimony obligation.â€Â \r\n  Consequently, Husband derives his sole source of income from the profit of the\r\n  CafÃ©.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  CafÃ©â€™s 10 month income statement showed a net income of $21,076.14 as of\r\n  October 31, 2004.Â  However, we note the CafÃ©â€™s 11-month net income statement as\r\n  of November 30, 2003, showed the business was operating at a net loss of\r\n  $12,263.93 for 2003, and the October 2002 income statement showed the business\r\n  producing a mere profit of $1,032 for 10 months in 2002.Â  In their testimony,\r\n  Husband and his accountant, Gerald Saunders, corroborated these figures.Â \r\n  Moreover, net income from the CafÃ© pays off business loans and lines of credit\r\n  and is used to acquire business assets; the net income does not all go directly\r\n  to Husband as a salary.Â  Rather, Husband may take â€œdistributionsâ€ for personal\r\n  expenses.Â  Husband testified he had drawn only $3,578.19 from the CafÃ© during\r\n  the first six months of 2004.Â  Based on this distribution, Husband estimated\r\n  $596 was his monthly salary from the CafÃ©.Â  Saunders later testified Husbandâ€™s\r\n  annual distributions were $9,150 in 2002; $1,000 in 2003; and $6,785 in 2004.Â \r\n  Though Husbandâ€™s tax returns are not included as part of the trial record,\r\n  Saunders also testified $16,090.92 was Husbandâ€™s taxable income in 2004.Â  The\r\n  cash flow statement for the CafÃ© showed $16,090.92 as â€œincome per tax returnâ€\r\n  in 2004, but these figures were negative for 2002 and 2003.Â  \r\nDue\r\n  to the nature of Husbandâ€™s business, it is difficult to determine his exact\r\n  annual salary.Â  Instead, Husband withdraws his income from the CafÃ© based on\r\n  available income after meeting debt obligations and making necessary business\r\n  purchases.Â  Moreover, the family court found â€œnothing improper in [Husbandâ€™s]\r\n  record keeping or expenditures,â€ nor did the family court believe Husband was\r\n  hiding personal expenditures behind the CafÃ© or that he was â€œliving out ofâ€\r\n  it.Â  We additionally note Husband has drawn against his retirement account for\r\n  living expenses and to make loan payments.Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  we note the family court drastically decreased Wifeâ€™s alimony, after examining\r\n  the record, we find the amount she receives is in line with Husbandâ€™s decreased\r\n  earning capacity.Â  Additionally, we note Husbandâ€™s decreased income is partly\r\n  attributable to unforeseen changes in market conditions.Â  Therefore, if a\r\n  situation arises where Husbandâ€™s earnings increase, Wife has the ability to\r\n  petition the family court for an increase in her monthly alimony based on\r\n  changed circumstances.Â  However, in the meantime, we find the family court did\r\n  not abuse its discretion in reducing the amount of alimony Husband owes and\r\n  affirm the family courtâ€™s revised calculation of alimony.Â  \r\nII.Â  Husbandâ€™s Appeal\r\nHusband\r\n  argues the federal bankruptcy law stays enforcement of the family courtâ€™s\r\n  orders regarding the payment of Wifeâ€™s division of the marital property\r\n  relating to 1) the CafÃ©; 2) Dodge automobile; 3) Wifeâ€™s award for past due\r\n  COBRA payments; 4) past due attorneyâ€™s fees; and 5) attorneyâ€™s fees for the\r\n  present action.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe filing of\r\n  a petition for bankruptcy operates as an automatic stay of most state court\r\n  proceedings.[3] Â 11 U.S.C.A. Â§ 362(a) (West 2004 &amp; Supp. 2008).Â \r\n  â€œOnce a bankruptcy petition is filed, the bankruptcy court takes custody of all\r\n  property in the debtorâ€™s possession.â€Â  Bragg v. Bragg, 347 S.C. 16, 24,\r\n  553 S.E.2d 251, 255 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Upon such a filing, the debtorâ€™s property\r\n  is under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court, and â€œno other Court, and no\r\n  person acting under any process from any other Court, can, without the\r\n  permission of the Bankrupt[cy] Court, interfere with it.â€ Bragg, 347\r\n  S.C. at 24, 553 S.E.2d at 255 (internal citations omitted).Â  Due to the\r\n  bankruptcy courtâ€™s exclusive jurisdiction over Husbandâ€™s debts, no action can\r\n  be maintained in a state court to enjoin assets within the bankruptcy courtâ€™s\r\n  jurisdiction, nor can a state court issue an order that would interfere with\r\n  the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court. Â Id. at 24, 553 S.E.2d at\r\n  255-56. \r\nOn\r\n  September 23, 2005, Husband filed a petition for bankruptcy in the United\r\n  States Bankruptcy Court for the District of South Carolina.Â  Thereafter, on\r\n  March 14, 2006, the bankruptcy court issued its order confirming the Chapter 13\r\n  Plan and resolving motions.Â  In the Chapter 13 Plan, Wife was listed as a\r\n  priority creditor. Â The state courts no longer have jurisdiction over the debts\r\n  owed Wife.Â  Accordingly, Husbandâ€™s appeal is held in abeyance.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, we\r\n  affirm the family courtâ€™s decision to reduce Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation due\r\n  to a substantial and material change in his circumstances and hold the\r\n  remaining issues in abeyance.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART\r\n  AND HELD IN ABEYANCE IN PART.\r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE,\r\n  and WILLIAMS, JJ. concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Although the facts in Arnal involved reduction\r\n  of child support payments, because voluntary underemployment occurs in the\r\n  alimony arena as well, we find the situation analogous to alimony.Â  \r\n[3]Â An action for the establishment or modification of\r\n  an order for domestic support obligations is not subject to the bankruptcy\r\n  automatic stay.Â  11 U.S.C.A.

Elwell, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tKim Jackson, of Simpsonville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Â Â Rooms\r\n  To Go Furniture (Rooms To Go) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order affirming the\r\n  magistrateâ€™s order, which awarded Kim Jackson (Jackson) damages.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nJackson purchased a living room set from Rooms To Go and had it delivered to her newly-built\r\n  condominium, where her two children lived while they were in college.[2]Â  Jackson was not at the home when the\r\n  furniture was delivered; however, her twenty-year-old son was present.Â  The son\r\n  signed off on the delivery, indicating there was no damage.Â  The daughter testified\r\n  she came home after the furniture was delivered and discovered the delivery men\r\n  had damaged part of a wall and snagged the carpet.Â  The daughter then called Jackson to tell her about the damage.Â  Jackson called Rooms To Go and spoke with a claims\r\n  manager, Janine Murphy.[3]Â \r\n  Jackson requested Rooms To Go repair the damage to her home.Â  In the meantime,\r\n  Jackson hired her own painter to repaint the walls in her living room.Â  At\r\n  trial, she testified she thought it cost $600 to repaint the living room.Â  She\r\n  also testified she thought it would cost about $1,800 to $2,000 to replace the\r\n  carpet.\r\nJackson and Murphy were unable to resolve the issue after numerous\r\n  exchanges, and thus, Jackson filed an action in magistrate court on May 3, 2006.Â \r\n  After a non-jury trial in which Jackson represented herself, the magistrate ruled\r\n  in Jacksonâ€™s favor, awarding her $2,500 in damages and $80 in costs.Â  Rooms To\r\n  Go appealed to the circuit court on December 20, 2006.Â  On March 29, 2007,\r\n  after a hearing that Jackson did not attend, the court affirmed the\r\n  magistrateâ€™s order without any specific findings.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe standard of review to be applied by a circuit court\r\n  in an appeal of a magistrateâ€™s judgment is prescribed by section 18-7-170 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code:\r\n\r\n\tUpon\r\n  hearing the appeal the appellate court shall give judgment according to the\r\n  justice of the case, without regard to technical errors and defects which do\r\n  not affect the merits. In giving judgment the court may affirm or reverse the\r\n  judgment of the court below, in whole or in part, as to any or all the parties\r\n  and for errors of law or fact.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-170 (1985); see also Hadfield v. Gilchrist, 343 S.C. 88, 92-93, 538 S.E.2d\r\n  268, 270 (Ct. App. 2000); Burns v. Wannamaker, 281 S.C. 352, 357, 315\r\n  S.E.2d 179, 182 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  the circuit court maintains a broad scope of review, our standard is more limited:\r\n\r\n\t[T]he\r\n  Court of Appeals will presume that an affirmance by a Circuit Court of a\r\n  magistrateâ€™s judgment was made upon the merits where the testimony is\r\n  sufficient to sustain the judgment of the magistrate and there are no facts\r\n  that show the affirmance was influenced by an error of law.\r\n\r\nBurns, 281 S.C. at 357, 315 S.E.2d at 182; see also Price\r\n  v. Charleston &amp; W.C. Ry. Co., 93 S.C. 576, 578, 77 S.E. 703, 703\r\n  (1913); Stanford v. Cudd, 93 S.C. 367, 370, 76 S.E. 986, 987 (1913).Â  â€œUnless\r\n  we find an error of law, we will affirm the judgeâ€™s holding if there are any\r\n  facts supporting his decision.â€Â  Hadfield, 343 S.C. at 94, 538 S.E.2d at\r\n  271.\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Hearsay\r\nRooms\r\n  To Go argues the circuit court erred by failing to reverse the magistrateâ€™s\r\n  judgment because the magistrate allowed Jackson to refer to written estimates\r\n  of her damages, which Rooms To Go contends was inadmissible hearsay.Â  We\r\n  disagree.[4]Â  \r\nThe\r\n  court did not allow Jackson to enter the estimates into evidence; however, it\r\n  did allow her to state how much she thought it would cost to repaint the walls\r\n  and replace the carpet.Â  â€œIt is the well-settled law of this state that an\r\n  owner may testify as to the value of damaged real and personal property.â€Â  Waites\r\n    v. S.C. Windstorm &amp; Hail Underwriting Assocs., 279 S.C. 362, 366, 307\r\n  S.E.2d 223, 225 (1983); see also Nelson v. Coleman Co., 249 S.C.\r\n  652, 659-60, 155 S.E.2d 917, 921 (1967); Howell v. State Hwy. Depâ€™t, 167\r\n  S.C. 217, 225, 166 S.E.2d 129, 132 (1932). \r\nTherefore,\r\n  we find the circuit court did not err in allowing Jackson to testify to the\r\n  value of her damaged property.Â Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Incorrect Party\r\nRooms\r\n  To Go argues the magistrate erred by ruling against it because Rooms To Go did\r\n  not have a contract with Jackson.Â  Specifically, Rooms To Go argues it contracts\r\n  with Southeast to deliver its furniture, thus the action should have been\r\n  brought against Southeast instead of Rooms To Go because Southeast delivered Jacksonâ€™s furniture.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  necessary elements of a contract are an offer, acceptance, and valuable\r\n  consideration.â€Â  Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of S.C., 354 S.C. 397, 406,\r\n  581 S.E.2d 161, 166 (2003).Â  At trial, Jackson presented evidence she had a\r\n  contract with Rooms To Go, not Southeast.Â  Jackson testified she paid Rooms To\r\n  Go to deliver the furniture because Rooms To Go would not allow her to pick up\r\n  the furniture herself.Â  Jackson was not aware a third party would be delivering\r\n  her furniture.Â  Rooms To Go did not present any evidence otherwise.Â  Also,\r\n  Murphy, the claims manager for Southeast, and the deliveryman testified\r\n  Southeast only makes deliveries for Rooms To Go.\r\nThus,\r\n  we find the magistrate did not err by ruling against Rooms To Go because Jackson contracted with Rooms To Go to deliver her furniture, not Southeast. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nTherefore,\r\n  the order of the circuit court is Â \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and SHORT and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Jackson testified she paid Rooms To Go to deliver the\r\n  furniture because Rooms To Go would not allow her to pick up the furniture\r\n  herself.Â  Jackson was not aware a third party would be delivering her\r\n  furniture.Â  \r\n[3]Â  Jackson testified she called the Rooms To Go â€œ1-800â€\r\n  number to report the damage to her house; however, she spoke with Murphy, who\r\n  later testified she worked for Southeast Independent Delivery Services, Inc.\r\n  (Southeast) as a claims manager.\r\n[4] Â Jackson did\r\n  not file a respondentâ€™s brief.Â  The South Carolina Appellate Court Rules\r\n  provide that â€œ[u]pon the failure of respondent to timely file a brief, the\r\n  appellate court may take such action as it deems proper.â€Â  Rule 208(a)(4),\r\n  SCACR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-435","title":"State v.
