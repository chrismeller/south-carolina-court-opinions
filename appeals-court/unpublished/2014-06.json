(Mother) appeals the family court's orders allowing\r\nDSS to forego reasonable efforts to reunite Mother with her minor child (Child)\r\nand terminating Mother's parental rights to Child. On appeal, Mother argues the\r\nfamily court erred in allowing DSS to forego reasonable efforts for reunification\r\nand in proceeding with the termination of parental rights (TPR) hearing. We\r\naffirm.1\r\n\r\nOn appeal from the family court, an appellate court reviews factual and legal issues\r\nde novo. Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C. 412, 414, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011);\r\nLewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 386, 709 S.E.2d 650, 651-52 (2011). Although this\r\ncourt reviews the family court's findings de novo, this court is not required to\r\nignore the fact that the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a\r\nbetter position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their\r\ntestimony. Lewis, 392 S.C. at 385, 709 S.E.2d at 651-52. The burden is upon the\r\nappellant to convince this court that the family court erred in its findings. Id.\r\n\r\nWe find a preponderance of the evidence supports the family court's order allowing\r\nDSS to forego reasonable efforts for reunification and decision to proceed with the\r\nTPR hearing.2 See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-1640(C) (Supp. 2013) (identifying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n2 The family court \"must make specific written findings in support of its\r\nconclusion\" to either terminate or continue reasonable efforts. S.C. Code Ann.\r\n§ 63-7-1640(F) (Supp. 2013). The family court failed to include specific written\r\nfindings supporting its decision to terminate reasonable efforts. When an order of\r\nthe family court violates Rule 26(a), SCRFC, by failing to set forth specific\r\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law, this court may remand the matter to the\r\nfamily court or make its own findings of fact in accordance with the preponderance\r\nof the evidence if the record is sufficient to allow such a review. Griffith v.\r\nGriffith, 332 S.C. 630, 646-47, 506 S.E.2d 526, 535 (Ct. App. 1998); see also Ex\r\nparte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 61, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652 (2006) (\"In appeals from the\r\nfamily court, the appellate court has the authority to find the facts in accordance\r\n\nseveral factors for the family court to consider when determining whether to\r\nauthorize DSS to terminate or forego reasonable efforts). Here, the family court\r\nremoved Child pursuant to an order that stated, \"[Mother]'s admitting her actions\r\ntoward [Child are] crucial to her treatment plan\" and that \"[a]s part of this\r\ntreatment, it is required that [Mother] continue to acknowledge her prior abusive\r\nactions toward [Child].\" However, during an evaluation with Dr. Pamela\r\nCrawford, Mother repeatedly denied abusing her children. Dr. Crawford\r\ndetermined that because Mother denied the allegations of abuse, \"a treatment plan\r\nto address [Mother's] episodes of violence [wa]s not viable.\" Because the family\r\ncourt's removal order was specifically conditioned on Mother's acceptance of\r\nresponsibility for her prior physical abuse of her children, Mother's refusal to\r\naccept responsibility for the abuse \"ma[d]e continuation or implementation of\r\nreasonable efforts to preserve or reunify the family inconsistent with the permanent\r\nplan for the child.\" See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-1640(C)(8) (Supp. 2013) (allowing\r\nthe family court to authorize DSS to forego reasonable efforts for reunification if\r\nthe family court finds \"circumstances exist that the [family] court finds make\r\ncontinuation or implementation of reasonable efforts to preserve or reunify the\r\nfamily inconsistent with the permanent plan for the child\").\r\n\r\nAdditionally, DSS was allowed to forego reasonable efforts for reunification\r\nbecause Mother abused her children while they were in her care. See S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 63-7-1640(C)(1)(a) (Supp. 2013) (stating the family court may authorize\r\nDSS to forego reasonable efforts for reunification when \"the family court\r\ndetermines . . . the parent has subjected the child or another child while residing in\r\nthe parent's domicile to . . . severe or repeated abuse\"). Specifically, the family\r\ncourt previously entered a finding of physical abuse against Mother after a human\r\nbite mark was found on Child's sister. Furthermore, another finding of physical\r\nabuse was made after Mother admitted to \"cursing at [Child], repeatedly slapping\r\nand threatening [Child], and stomping the foot of [Child].\" Therefore, DSS was\r\nallowed to forego reasonable efforts for reunification based on abuse.\r\n\r\nFinally, it was in Child's best interest for the family court to allow DSS to forego\r\nreasonable efforts for reunification. See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-1640(F) (\"In\r\ndetermining whether to authorize [DSS] to terminate or forego reasonable efforts\r\nto preserve or reunify a family, the court must consider whether initiation or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith its view of the preponderance of the evidence.\"). We find the record in the\r\ncase at bar is sufficient to allow such a review.\r\n\ncontinuation of reasonable efforts to preserve or reunify the family is in the best\r\ninterests of the child.\"). Child has been in and out of foster care three times since\r\n2007, and allowing DSS to forego reasonable efforts shortens the time Child is\r\nrequired to remain in foster care before he can be adopted. Likewise, Dr. Crawford\r\nopined Mother's refusal to accept responsibility for the abuse made it unlikely she\r\nwould respond to treatment and that because of Mother's history of abuse and her\r\nbehavior during the evaluation, she \"may represent a danger to others.\"\r\nAccordingly, the family court did not err in allowing DSS to forego reasonable\r\nefforts for reunification and in proceeding with the TPR hearing.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and THOMAS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-214","title":"SCDSS v.

On\r\nappeal, the Fund contends the Appellate Panel erred in finding it was required to\r\nreimburse Carrier because (1) Carrier requested reimbursement after December 31,\r\n2011, the last day the Fund was statutorily required to accept a claim for\r\nreimbursement; (2) Carrier failed to submit certain witness testimony to the Fund\r\nprior to June 30, 2011, the date on which \"all required information\" to support a\r\nreimbursement claim must be submitted to the Fund; (3) Lester Miller\r\n(\"Employee\") was not working for Employer on the date of his injury; and (4)\r\nEmployee's preexisting condition was not permanent and sufficiently serious to\r\nconstitute a hindrance or obstacle to employment. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1. We find Carrier timely requested reimbursement from the Fund prior to\r\nDecember 31, 2011. Carrier complied with the statutory requirements of section\r\n42-7-320(B) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2013) by properly submitting its\r\nclaim to the Fund prior to December 31, 2011. Upon the Fund's denial of Carrier's\r\nclaim, Carrier timely requested a hearing and submitted satisfactory evidence to\r\nestablish its entitlement to reimbursement pursuant to section 42-9-400(c) of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code (Supp. 2013). See § 42-7-320(B) (\"After December 31,\r\n2011, the Second Injury Fund shall not accept a claim for reimbursement from any\r\nemployer, self-insurer, or insurance carrier.\" (emphasis added)); § 42-9-400(c) (\"In\r\norder to qualify under this section for reimbursement from the Second Injury Fund,\r\nthe employer must establish when claim is made for reimbursement thereunder,\r\nthat the employer had knowledge of the permanent physical impairment at the time\r\nthat the employee was hired, or at the time the employee was retained in\r\nemployment after the employer acquired such knowledge.\"); S.C. Second Injury\r\nFund v. Am. Yard Prods., 330 S.C. 20, 22, 496 S.E.2d 862, 863 (1998) (\"If the\r\nFund denies a claim for reimbursement, the employer or carrier may request a\r\nhearing before the Commission on the claim.\" (citing S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 67-\r\n208(D) (1990))).\r\n\r\n2. We find the Fund's argument pertaining to the single commissioner's\r\nconsideration of certain witness testimony to be abandoned on appeal. The Fund\r\nfails to specify which witness, and more importantly, what testimony, the single\r\ncommissioner improperly considered. Without more, we find the Fund's claim is\r\nnot supported by appropriate argument. See In re Care & Treatment of\r\nMcCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 92, 551 S.E.2d 235, 238 (2001) (holding an issue is\r\n\ndeemed abandoned if the argument in the brief is not supported by authority or is\r\nonly conclusory). As the appellant, the Fund has the responsibility of including all\r\nrelevant information in the record on appeal, and without this testimony to review,\r\nthis court cannot adequately evaluate this assertion of error. See Harkins v.\r\nGreenville Cnty., 340 S.C. 606, 616, 533 S.E.2d 886, 891 (2000) (finding it\r\nimpossible to evaluate the merits of certain issues because the appellant failed to\r\ninclude the relevant material in the record on appeal); Crestwood Golf Club, Inc. v.\r\nPotter, 328 S.C. 201, 215, 493 S.E.2d 826, 834 (1997) (noting an appellant bears\r\nthe burden of providing a sufficient record to review his assertions of error).\r\n\r\n3. We find the Fund's argument pertaining to whether Employee was working for\r\nCarrier on the date of his injury is unpreserved for our review. Although the Fund\r\nraised this issue in its pre-hearing brief to the single commissioner, the parties\r\nstipulated before the single commissioner that Employee was injured on April 11,\r\n2008, and Employee's underlying claim for his work-related injury was\r\ncompensable. The Fund also did not raise Employee's employment status in its\r\nissues on appeal to the Appellate Panel. Accordingly, we find Employee's work\r\nstatus to be the law of the case and thus not subject to review on appeal. See\r\nHudson ex rel. Hudson v. Lancaster Convalescent Ctr., 407 S.C. 112, ___, 754\r\nS.E.2d 486, 490 (2014) (finding issue unpreserved under law of the case doctrine\r\nbecause employer failed to raise it to the Appellate Panel); In re Morrison, 321\r\nS.C. 370, 372 n.2, 468 S.E.2d 651, 652 n.2 (1996) (noting that an unappealed\r\nruling becomes the law of the case and precludes further consideration of the issue\r\non appeal).\r\n\r\n4. We find the Appellate Panel did not err in finding Employee's preexisting\r\nconditions were permanent and sufficiently serious to constitute a hindrance or\r\nobstacle to employment pursuant to section 42-9-400. Carrier documented\r\nnumerous medical conditions that predated Employee's job with Employer and\r\nwould constitute permanent physical impairments. Specifically, Carrier introduced\r\ntestimony regarding Employee's medical history and conditions from Employee's\r\nprimary care physician, Dr. James Timmons, Jr.; Employee's treating\r\npulmonologist, Dr. I.F. Afulukwe; and another evaluating pulmonologist, Dr.\r\nJoseph Boscia, II. Further, Carrier submitted documentation that Employer was\r\naware of Employee's inability to wear a respirator mask due to his breathing\r\nproblems and lung condition but still permitted him to be exposed to fumes and\r\ndusts that exacerbated his medical issues. See § 42-9-400(d) (stating that a\r\n\"'permanent physical impairment'\" refers to \"any permanent condition, whether\r\ncongenital or due to injury or disease, of such seriousness as to constitute a\r\n\nhindrance or obstacle to obtaining employment or to obtaining reemployment if the\r\nemployee should become unemployed\" (emphasis added)); § 42-9-400(d)(31)\r\n(\"When an employer establishes his prior knowledge of the permanent impairment,\r\nthen there shall be a presumption that the condition is permanent and that a\r\nhindrance or obstacle to employment or reemployment exists when the condition is\r\n. . . [] pulmonary disease.\"). As a result, we hold the foregoing evidence brings\r\nCarrier's claim for reimbursement within the ambit of section 42-9-400.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, LOCKEMY, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-208","title":"State v.

The Stoneledge at Lake Keowee Owners'\r\nAssociation, Inc. (SOA) brought suit against Marick and several other parties\r\ninvolved in the development and construction of the townhomes. The SOA\r\nasserted negligence and breach of warranty claims based on the existence of\r\nmultiple construction defects. Subsequently, Marick brought cross-claims against\r\ntwo subcontractors that performed work on the project—the respondents Hutch N\r\nSon Construction, Inc. and Upstate Utilities, LLC—for equitable indemnity,\r\nnegligence, and breach of warranty, and, as against Hutch N Son only, breach of\r\ncontract.1 Hutch N Son and Upstate Utilities filed motions for summary judgment\r\non all of Marick's cross-claims, which the trial court granted. We affirm.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Marick first argues the trial court erred in treating Marick's cross-claims\r\nfor breach of warranty, negligence, and breach of contract as a single claim for\r\nequitable indemnity. We find this issue is not preserved for our review. First,\r\nMarick did not assert this argument to the trial court. See Whaley v. CSX Transp.,\r\nInc., 362 S.C. 456, 482, 609 S.E.2d 286, 299 (2005) (finding issue not preserved\r\nbecause it was not raised to and ruled upon by the trial court). Second, Marick\r\nconceded its cross-claims were claims for equitable indemnity at the summary\r\njudgment hearing. See Austin v. Stokes-Craven Holding Corp., 387 S.C. 22, 45-46,\r\n691 S.E.2d 135, 147 (2010) (holding issue not preserved because appellant\r\nconceded issue at trial). Finally, to the extent Marick disagreed with the trial\r\ncourt's finding that Marick \"acknowledged that equitable indemnification was the\r\nonly claim at issue,\" Marick needed to file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to\r\npreserve the issue for appeal. See Doe v. Doe, 324 S.C. 492, 502, 478 S.E.2d 854,\r\n859 (Ct. App. 1996) (\"[T]he proper procedure for correcting factual errors in an\r\norder is to file a Motion to Alter or Amend pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.\").\r\n\r\nMarick further contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on its\r\nequitable indemnity cross-claim because a question of fact exists as to whether\r\nMarick was at fault for the resulting construction defect. See Rule 56(c), SCRCP\r\n(stating summary judgment is appropriate when \"there is no genuine issue as to\r\nany material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\r\nlaw\"); Rock Hill Tel. Co. v. Globe Commc'ns, Inc., 363 S.C. 385, 389, 611 S.E.2d\r\n\r\n1Only one defect stated in the SOA's complaint against Marick related to the work\r\nperformed by Hutch N Son and Upstate Utilities.\r\n\n235, 237 (2005) (defining equitable indemnity as a \"form of compensation in\r\nwhich a first party is liable to pay a second party for a loss or damage the second\r\nparty incurs to a third party\" (citation omitted)); Walterboro Cmty. Hosp. v.\r\nMeacher, 392 S.C. 479, 486, 709 S.E.2d 71, 74 (Ct. App. 2011) (\"The most\r\nimportant requirement for . . . equitable indemnity is that the party seeking to be\r\nindemnified is adjudged without fault and the indemnifying party is the one at\r\nfault.\" (citation omitted)).\r\n\r\nHutch N Son and Upstate Utilities submitted expert affidavits that demonstrated\r\n(1) their conduct did not cause the construction defect at issue in this appeal, but,\r\ninstead, (2) Marick was at fault for the resulting defect because it breached its\r\nsupervisory duty as general contractor. We agree with the trial court's finding that\r\nMarick presented no evidence \"to rebut [these] expert affidavits.\"\r\n\r\nMarick argues it submitted expert deposition testimony to refute the evidence\r\npresented by Hutch N Son and Upstate Utilities. We find the deposition testimony\r\nrelied on by Marick is too general to show there is a genuine issue of fact\r\nremaining for trial. See Sides v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 362 S.C. 250, 255, 607\r\nS.E.2d 362, 364 (Ct. App. 2004) (\"Once the moving party carries its initial burden,\r\nthe opposing party must come forward with specific facts that show there is a\r\ngenuine issue of fact remaining for trial.\" (citing Baughman v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co.,\r\n306 S.C. 101, 115, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545 (1991))); 49 C.J.S. Judgments § 330\r\n(2009) (stating \"mere general statements and opinion by an expert are insufficient\r\nto controvert a movant's properly presented evidence on a motion for summary\r\njudgment\"); 49 C.J.S. Judgments § 301 (2009) (providing \"mere conclusory\r\nallegations or speculation that fact issues exist will not defeat a properly supported\r\nsummary judgment motion\"). Thus, we affirm the trial court's granting of\r\nsummary judgment.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., SHORT and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-210","title":"State v.

Benjamin Aplin, both of Columbia,\r\n            for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Steven Kranendonk appeals his convictions for two counts of\r\nreckless homicide by operation of a boat. Kranendonk argues the trial court erred\r\nin (1) qualifying Investigator Robin Camlin as an expert in navigational rules and\r\n\nallowing her to offer opinions that exceeded her qualifications; and (2) admitting\r\nevidence of Kranendonk's blood alcohol content that was allegedly obtained\r\nwithout probable cause. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1.     We hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it qualified Camlin\r\nas an expert in navigational boating rules. State v. Price, 368 S.C. 494, 498, 629\r\nS.E.2d 363, 365 (2006) (\"The decision to admit or exclude testimony from an\r\nexpert witness rests within the trial court's sound discretion.\"); State v. White, 382\r\nS.C. 265, 269, 676 S.E.2d 684, 686 (2009) (stating the admission or exclusion of\r\nexpert testimony will not be reversed absent a prejudicial abuse of discretion). She\r\nderived her opinions from facts within her knowledge and her professional\r\nexperience with boating rules. See State v. Goode, 305 S.C. 176, 178, 406 S.E.2d\r\n391, 393 (Ct. App. 1991) (\"There is no abuse of discretion as long as the witness\r\nhas acquired by study or practical experience such knowledge of the subject matter\r\nof [her] testimony as would enable [her] to give guidance and assistance to the jury\r\nin resolving a factual issue which is beyond the scope of the jury's good judgment\r\nand common knowledge.\"). Accordingly, we find no error in Camlin's\r\nqualification and the admission of her expert testimony.\r\n\r\n2.     We find the facts and circumstances known to the officer requesting the\r\nblood sample would warrant a prudent man to believe Kranendonk violated section\r\n50-21-113. See S.C. Code Ann. § 50-21-116 (2008) (requiring an individual to\r\nsubmit to a breath, blood, or urine test if an officer has probable cause to believe\r\nthe individual has violated section 50-21-113—the statute that provides penalties\r\nfor operating a boat while under the influence of alcohol resulting in death); Henry\r\nv. United States, 361 U.S. 98, 102 (1959) (\"Probable cause exists if the facts and\r\ncircumstances known to the officer warrant a prudent man in believing that the\r\noffense has been committed.\"). The officer articulated specific reasons for drawing\r\nKranendonk's blood, including: (1) his knowledge that Kranendonk operated a boat\r\ninvolved in an accident with multiple fatalities; (2) his knowledge that Kranendonk\r\nhad been drinking prior to the accident; and (3) his observation that Kranendonk\r\nsmelled of alcohol. Therefore, we find probable cause existed and hold the trial\r\ncourt did not err in admitting evidence of Kranendonk's blood alcohol content.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and SHORT and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-211","title":"Hickman v.

The Workers' Compensation Commission (the\r\n\nCommission) affirmed the Single Commissioner, finding Hickman did not suffer a\r\ncompensable change of condition. Hickman appeals, arguing the Commission\r\nerred in failing to: (1) liberally construe the Workers' Compensation Act (the Act);\r\n(2) find he suffered a compensable change of condition; and (3) find back surgery\r\nwould lessen his period of disability. We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR,\r\nand the following authorities:\r\n\r\n1.     As to Hickman's argument the Commission erred in failing to liberally\r\nconstrue the Act, we find the Commission properly construed the applicable\r\nprovisions of the Act in this case. See Hutson v. S.C. State Ports Auth., 399 S.C.\r\n381, 387, 732 S.E.2d 500, 503 (2012) (stating \"the guiding principle undergirding\r\nour workers' compensation system that the Act is to be liberally construed in favor\r\nof the claimant\"); Bass v. Isochem, 365 S.C. 454, 469, 617 S.E.2d 369, 377 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2005) (\"All rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one that\r\nlegislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language\r\nused, and that language must be construed in the light of the intended purpose of\r\nthe statute.\"); see also Wigfall v. Tideland Utils., Inc., 354 S.C. 100, 117, 580\r\nS.E.2d 100, 109 (2003) (explaining the appellate courts may not extend the Act by\r\nproviding a more liberal rule of compensation than that which the legislature has\r\nintended).\r\n\r\n2.     As to Hickman's argument the Commission erred in failing to find he\r\nsuffered a compensable change of condition, we find no reversible error by the\r\nCommission. See S.C. Code Ann. § 42-17-90(A) (Supp. 2013) (permitting the\r\nreview of a previous compensation award \"on proof by a preponderance of the\r\nevidence that there has been a change of condition caused by the original injury,\r\nafter the last payment of compensation\"); Causby v. Rock Hill Printing &\r\nFinishing Co., 249 S.C. 225, 227, 153 S.E.2d 697, 698 (1967) (explaining the Act\r\ndefines a change of condition in a compensation claim as \"a change in the\r\nclaimant's physical condition as a result of the original injury, occurring after the\r\nfirst award\"); Krell v.

Pleasant, for Respondents. \n\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: The South Carolina Second Injury Fund (the \"Fund\") appeals the\r\ncircuit court's decision to affirm the South Carolina Worker's Compensation\r\nCommission's (the \"Commission\") decision that AVX Corporation and Liberty\r\nMutual Insurance (collectively, \"AVX\") timely commenced a claim for\r\nreimbursement within the ten-year statute of limitations provided by section 15-3-\r\n600 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2013). We affirm.\r\n\r\nWe find AVX timely commenced its claim for reimbursement within the ten-year\r\nstatute of limitations. Under section 42-9-400 of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n2013), as soon as practicable, an \"employer or [its] carrier must notify the\r\n[Commission] and the Director of the [Fund] in writing of any possible claim\r\nagainst the [F]und\" and provide certain basic information about the potential claim\r\nfor reimbursement. § 42-9-400(f). An action for reimbursement \"must be\r\ncommenced within ten years\" after the carrier provides notice pursuant to section\r\n42-9-400. See § 15-3-600 (\"An action for relief not provided for in this chapter\r\nmust be commenced within ten years after the cause of action shall have\r\naccrued.\"); Transp. Ins. Co. & Flagstar Corp. v. S.C. Second Injury Fund, 389 S.C.\r\n422, 430-31, 699 S.E.2d 687, 691 (2010) (\"[A] cause of action for reimbursement\r\nbegins to accrue on the date a carrier provides notice to the Fund [pursuant to\r\nsection 42-9-400].\").\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, AVX provided notice to the Fund pursuant to section 42-9-400\r\nin August 1999. AVX submitted its claim to the Fund in July 2009, within the ten-\r\nyear statute of limitations. \"Once a claim is submitted, the Fund may agree to\r\nreimburse an employer or carrier.\" S.C. Second Injury Fund v. Am. Yard Prods.,\r\n330 S.C. 20, 23 n.1, 496 S.E.2d 862, 863 n.1 (1998). \"If the Fund denies a claim\r\nfor reimbursement, [then] the employer or carrier may request a hearing before the\r\nCommission on the claim.\" Id. (citing 25A S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 67-208(D)\r\n(1990)). Accordingly, we agree with the Commission's interpretation that filing a\r\nclaim with the Fund constitutes commencing an action for reimbursement. See\r\nCFRE, LLC v. Greenville Cnty.

The Gadsons argue the trial court erred in (1) granting summary\r\njudgment based on deemed admissions because the Rule 40(j), SCRCP, consent\r\nmotion justified their late responses and they effectively withdrew their admissions\r\nby filing late responses; (2) failing to grant their motion to withdraw admissions\r\nbecause withdrawal would promote the merits of the case and would not prejudice\r\nBank of America; and (3) failing to state reasons for denying their motion to\r\nwithdraw admissions.

As to whether the trial court erred in denying the Gadsons' motion: Rule 36(b),\r\nSCRCP (stating a trial court \"may permit withdrawal or amendment [of\r\nadmissions] when the presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved\r\nthereby and the party who obtained the admissions fails to satisfy the court that\r\nwithdrawal or amendment will prejudice him in maintaining his action or defense\r\non the merits\"); Scott, 353 S.C. at 652, 579 S.E.2d at 158 (holding the trial court\r\nabused its discretion by allowing the withdrawal of admissions because the party\r\nwho obtained the admission demonstrated prejudice).\r\n\r\n3.

Blitch, Jr., both of\r\n           Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: James C. Tyner appeals his convictions for assault and battery of\r\na high and aggravated nature (ABHAN) and strong armed robbery. He contends\r\n\nthe trial court erred in denying his directed verdict motion as to the ABHAN\r\ncharge and in denying his Batson1 motion to quash the jury. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1.      The trial court did not err in denying Tyner's directed verdict motion,\r\nbecause the victim's testimony he was choked and could not breathe and the\r\nvictim's wife's testimony he was a bloody mess and displayed \"a good bit of\r\nbruising\" around his neck after the attack was some evidence from which the jury\r\ncould conclude the attack posed a substantial risk of death. See S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n16-3-600(B)(1) (Supp. 2013) (\"A person commits the offense of assault and battery\r\nof a high and aggravated nature if the person unlawfully injures another person,\r\nand: (a) great bodily injury to another person results; or (b) the act is accomplished\r\nby means likely to produce death or great bodily injury.\"); S.C. Code Ann. § 16-3-\r\n600(A)(1) (Supp. 2013) (\"'Great bodily injury' means bodily injury which causes a\r\nsubstantial risk of death or which causes serious, permanent disfigurement or\r\nprotracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member or organ.\"); State\r\nv. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 555, 564 S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002) (\"On an appeal from the\r\ntrial court's denial of a motion for a directed verdict, the appellate court may only\r\nreverse the trial court if there is no evidence to support the trial court's ruling.\"); id.\r\n(\"In ruling on a directed verdict motion, the trial court is concerned with the\r\nexistence of evidence, not its weight.\"); State v. Butler, 407 S.C. 376, ___, 755\r\nS.E.2d 457, 460 (2014) (\"On appeal from the denial of a directed verdict, [an\r\nappellate] court views the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most\r\nfavorable to the State.\"); id.

The trial court did not err in ruling the State's striking of Juror #39 and Juror\r\n#101 did not constitute a Batson violation, because, in the absence of contrary\r\nevidence in the record, demeanor is a race-neutral basis for exercising a jury strike.\r\nSee State v. Cochran, 369 S.C. 308, 317, 631 S.E.2d 294, 299 (Ct. App. 2006)\r\n(\"The demeanor of a prospective juror is generally a race-neutral reason for\r\nemploying a preemptory challenge.\"); State v.

Neil and Wesley Brian Sawyer, both of Murphy\r\n            & Grantland, PA, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Karen Givens, individually and as personal representative of the\r\nestate of her minor daughter, and Kayla Givens (collectively Appellants) appeal\r\nthe order of the trial court ruling Permanent General Assurance Company\r\n\n(Permanent General) was not obligated to provide liability insurance coverage to\r\nthe estate of Karen Givens's minor daughter.\r\n\r\nWe disagree with Appellants' argument. The language of the Permanent General\r\npolicy (Policy) provided coverage for at least thirty days from the date of\r\nacquisition of the Buick Century. \"Insurance policies are subject to the general\r\nrules of contract construction.\" Bennett & Bennett Constr., Inc. v. Auto Owners\r\nIns. Co., 405 S.C. 1, 4, 747 S.E.2d 426, 427 (2013). The words in an insurance\r\ncontract are to be given their \"plain, ordinary and popular meaning.\" Hutchinson v.\r\nLiberty Life Ins. Co., 404 S.C. 20, 23, 743 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2013). The Policy\r\nclearly provides the coverage for a newly-acquired vehicle is for thirty days unless\r\nthe policy expires or is cancelled during that thirty day period. In that case, the\r\ncoverage on the newly acquired vehicle would end with the expiration or\r\ncancellation of the Policy.\r\n\r\nWe find no merit to Appellants' assertions that Permanent General extended\r\ncoverage on the Buick Century past the cancellation date of the Policy. The Buick\r\nCentury was added to the Policy and Permanent General informed Karen Givens\r\nthat the Policy would be cancelled if payment was not received by March 16, 2011\r\nat the latest. When Permanent General cancelled the Policy, coverage on both the\r\noriginally covered vehicle and the Buick Century ended.\r\n\r\nWe disagree with Appellants' argument that section 56-10-280 of the South\r\nCarolina Code (Supp. 2013) mandates coverage on the Buick Century at the time\r\nof the accident. Section 56-10-280(A)(4) provides a contract or policy of\r\ninsurance may be canceled within the first sixty days when the insured fails to pay\r\nthe premium when due. However, this section further provides: \"The contract or\r\npolicy of insurance must remain in effect for at least thirty days.\" § 56-10-280.\r\n\"The primary purpose in interpreting statutes is to ascertain the intent of the\r\nLegislature.\" Cain v. Nationwide Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 378 S.C. 25, 29, 661\r\nS.E.2d 349, 351 (2008). The appellate court cannot construe a statute without\r\nregard to its plain and ordinary meaning, and it may not resort to subtle or forced\r\nconstruction in an attempt to limit or expand a statute's scope. Id. at 29, 661 S.E.2d\r\nat 351-52. The addition of a new vehicle is a \"change\" to an existing policy. Smith\r\nv. S.C. Ins. Co., 350 S.C. 82, 89, 564 S.E.2d 358, 362 (Ct. App. 2002).

(Carrier) reimbursement pursuant to section 42-9-\r\n400 of the South Carolina Code. The Fund argues (1) claimant's diabetes was not\r\nserious enough to constitute a hindrance or obstacle to employment or\r\nreemployment, nor did it result in a combination with or aggravation by claimant's\r\nsubsequent work-related injury; (2) the Commission erred in finding Carrier is\r\nentitled to reimbursement for claimant's permanent and total disability because\r\nclaimant's preexisting conditions did not contribute to claimant's disability; (3) the\r\nCommission erred in finding the Fund conceded knowledge of claimant's alleged\r\ntraumatic brain injury/brain damage and that claimant's prior concussion rose to the\r\nlevel of brain damage; and (4) if claimant's concussion constituted a permanent\r\ncondition, it was not serious enough to constitute a hindrance or obstacle to\r\nemployment, nor did it result in a combination with or aggravation by claimant's\r\nsubsequent work-related injury. Based on the substantial evidence of record, we\r\naffirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities:\r\n\r\n1. As to whether claimant's preexisting diabetes constituted a hindrance or obstacle\r\nto employment or reemployment, and whether it resulted in a combination with or\r\naggravation by claimant's work injury: Trotter v. Trane Coil Facility, 393 S.C. 637,\r\n644, 714 S.E.2d 289, 293 (2011) (\"The Administrative Procedures Act (APA)\r\nestablishes the standard for judicial review of workers' compensation decisions.\");\r\nid. (noting, under the APA, the appellate court can reverse or modify the decision\r\nof the Appellate Panel if the substantial rights of the appellant have been\r\nprejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law or is clearly\r\nerroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole\r\nrecord); Barton v. Higgs, 381 S.C. 367, 369-70, 674 S.E.2d 145, 146 (2009)\r\n(\"When reviewing an appeal from the workers' compensation commission, the\r\nappellate court may not weigh the evidence or substitute its judgment for that of\r\nthe [Appellate Panel] as to the weight of evidence on questions of fact.\"); Jordan v.\r\nKelly Co., 381 S.C. 483, 486, 674 S.E.2d 166, 168 (2009) (holding, in workers'\r\ncompensation cases, the Appellate Panel is the ultimate finder of fact and the\r\nappellate court must affirm the findings of fact made by the Appellate Panel if they\r\nare supported by substantial evidence); Frame v. Resort Servs. Inc., 357 S.C. 520,\r\n528, 593 S.E.2d 491, 495 (Ct. App. 2004) (\"The final determination of witness\r\ncredibility and the weight to be accorded evidence [in workers' compensation\r\ncases] is reserved to the Appellate Panel.\").\r\n\r\n2. As to whether the Commission erred in finding that Carrier is entitled to\r\nreimbursement for claimant's permanent and total disability based on the Fund's\r\nargument that claimant's preexisting conditions did not contribute to claimant's\r\n\ndisability: Jordan, 381 S.C. at 486, 674 S.E.2d at 168 (holding, in workers'\r\ncompensation cases, the Appellate Panel is the ultimate finder of fact and the\r\nappellate court must affirm the findings of fact made by the Appellate Panel if they\r\nare supported by substantial evidence); City of Greenville v. S.C. Second Injury\r\nFund, 339 S.C. 141, 146-47, 528 S.E.2d 91, 93-94 (Ct. App. 2000) (finding the\r\nrefusal of City's request for compensation from the Fund was proper when (1) the\r\nemployee was found to be totally disabled by the accident alone, such that the\r\nemployer could not incur greater liability for compensation due to a preexisting\r\ncondition, and (2) the employer did not incur a greater increase in liability for\r\nmedical payments due to a preexisting condition, as there was no substantial\r\nincrease in medical expenses from the preexisting condition).\r\n\r\n3. As to the remaining issues: Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc.,\r\n335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need\r\nnot address remaining issues when disposition of a prior issue is dispositive).1\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, THOMAS, and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The Fund conceded in oral argument that if this court found substantial evidence\r\nto support the Commission's finding that claimant's preexisting diabetes satisfied\r\nthe requirements of section 42-9-400 for reimbursement, we need not reach the\r\nissues regarding the preexisting brain injury.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-228","title":"State v.

On appeal, he\r\nargues the magistrates court erred in failing to (1) direct a verdict, (2) properly\r\ncharge the jury, and (3) recognize and apply pertinent law. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1.     We find the circuit court did not err in finding Buck was not entitled to a\r\ndirected verdict. \"On appeal from the denial of a directed verdict, an appellate\r\ncourt must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.\" State v.\r\nBailey, 368 S.C. 39, 44, 626 S.E.2d 898, 901 (Ct. App. 2006). \"If there is any\r\ndirect evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to\r\nprove the guilt of the accused, an appellate court must find the case was properly\r\nsubmitted to the jury.\" Id. at 45, 626 S.E.2d at 901. We find sufficient evidence\r\nexisted for the jury to find Buck's phone call was threatening or harassing. See\r\nS.C. Code Ann § 16-17-430(A)(2), (3) (2003); State v. Brown, 274 S.C. 506, 508,\r\n266 S.E.2d 64, 65 (1980) (construing the language of the unlawful\r\ncommunications statute \"as proscribing only calls initiated by one with the intent\r\nand sole purpose of conveying an unsolicited obscene, imminently threatening\r\nand/or harassing message to an unwilling recipient\"). The victim testified Buck\r\nhad been harassing and attempting to intimidate him; Buck continued to call the\r\nvictim's office and leave messages; Buck had been driving up and down the road\r\nblowing his horn and pointing his middle finger at the victim; and the situation was\r\nescalating. The State played a recording of a message Buck left with the victim,\r\nand Buck admitted to making the call. Additionally, Buck stated the victim\r\n\"reignited [his] spark of anger.\" Buck's assertion that his phone call was not\r\nobscene is inapposite because the unlawful communications statute is not limited\r\nto obscenity. To the extent Buck contends his speech was protected, the circuit\r\ncourt did not rule on this issue, and it is not preserved. See State v. Dunbar, 356\r\nS.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693 (2003) (\"In order for an issue to be preserved\r\nfor appellate review, it must have been raised to and ruled upon by the [circuit\r\ncourt].\"). There is no indication the magistrates court applied the wrong law when\r\ndetermining whether to grant a directed verdict, and sufficient evidence existed for\r\nthe jury to find Buck's phone call was threatening or harassing.\r\n\r\n2.    We find Buck abandoned the issue of whether the circuit court erred in\r\nfinding the magistrates court properly charged the jury. \"An issue raised on appeal\r\nbut not argued in the brief is deemed abandoned and will not be considered by the\r\nappellate court.\" Wright v. Craft, 372 S.C. 1, 20, 640 S.E.2d 486, 497 (Ct. App.\r\n2006). Buck raised the jury charge issue in his statement of issues on appeal, but\r\nthe body of his brief does not indicate what the magistrates court charged or why\r\n\nBuck believed the charge was erroneous. Although Buck cites to Brown and State\r\nv. Buckner, 342 S.C. 241, 534 S.E.2d 15 (Ct. App. 2000), it is unclear from his \n\r\nbrief how they pertain to the magistrates court's charge. See State v. Tyndall, 336 \n\r\nS.C. 8, 16-17, 518 S.E.2d 278, 282-83 (Ct. App. 1999) (determining the appellant \n\r\nabandoned an issue when he cited to several cases and averred the officers acted \n\r\ncontrary to the cases, but failed to refer to the cases again in his brief and failed to \n\r\n\"include in his argument any discussion of [the] decisions or their applicability to \n\r\nhis situation\"). Accordingly, we find this argument is abandoned. \n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.1\r\n\r\nHUFF, THOMAS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1   We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-231","title":"Outlaw v.

Rest Assured also challenges the\r\nALC's refusal to allow it to supplement the record. We reverse and find the aide\r\nworkers were independent contractors.\r\n\r\nWe agree with Appellant's argument that their personal care aide workers were not\r\nemployees but contract workers. The contract agreement and the conduct between\r\nAppellant and its workers were similar to that of Wilkinson ex rel. Wilkinson v.\r\nPalmetto State Transp. Co., 382 S.C. 295, 299, 676 S.E.2d 700, 702 (2009) (stating\r\nwhether independent contractor or employee status prevails depends on the issue of\r\ncontrol and whether employer had the right to control the performance of the\r\nwork). In our consideration of the record as a whole, we do not find there is\r\nsubstantial evidence in the record to support the ALC's decision. See ESA Servs.,\r\nLLC v. S.C.

The family court found the following statutory grounds for TPR were met: (1)\r\nChild lived outside Father's home for six months and Father failed to remedy the\r\nconditions that caused the removal; (2) Child lived outside Father's home for six\r\nmonths and Father willfully failed to visit Child; (3) Child lived outside Father's\r\nhome for six months and Father willfully failed to support Child; and (4) Father\r\nwillfully abandoned Child.

They argue the master in equity erred in (1)\r\nnot allowing them to proceed pro se and (2) not considering their defenses to the\r\nforeclosure. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1.     The Dennises' argument that they were not allowed to proceed pro se is not\r\npreserved. \"[A]n issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have\r\nbeen raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate\r\nreview.\" Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546\r\n(2000). During the foreclosure hearing, the el Beys identified themselves as the el\r\nBeys. They did not identify themselves as the Dennises, assert they were parties to\r\nthe action, or assert they were being denied their right to proceed pro se. Thus, this\r\nargument is not preserved.\r\n\r\n2.     We find the master did not err when he prohibited the el Beys from\r\ndefending the foreclosure and failed to consider their defenses. Based on the\r\ninformation the el Beys provided the master during the foreclosure hearing, the\r\nmaster correctly concluded the el Beys lacked standing. See Sea Pines Ass'n for\r\nProt. of Wildlife, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Natural Res., 345 S.C. 594, 600, 550 S.E.2d\r\n287, 291 (2001) (\"To have standing, one must have a personal stake in the subject\r\nmatter of the lawsuit. In other words, one must be a real party in interest.\"); id. (\"A\r\nreal party in interest is one who has a real, material, or substantial interest in the\r\nsubject matter of the action, as opposed to one who has only a nominal or technical\r\ninterest in the action.\"). At the hearing, the el Beys identified themselves as\r\nAkasha and Imin el Bey; they never identified themselves as the Dennises or\r\nasserted they were parties to the action. Akasha stated they were not attorneys.\r\nSee Renaissance Enters., Inc. v. Summit Teleservices, Inc., 334 S.C. 649, 651-52,\r\n515 S.E.2d 257, 258 (1999) (noting the Supreme Court of South Carolina has \"the\r\nduty to regulate the practice of law in South Carolina\" and prohibit the\r\nunauthorized practice of law). When asked what interest they had in the litigation,\r\nthe el Beys purported to represent James and Enid Dennis's living estates. The\r\nDennises concede on appeal that living estates do not exist in South Carolina, and\r\nwe find the master correctly determined the el Beys did not have standing based on\r\ntheir status as executors of a living estate. Because the foreclosure did not involve\r\nan estate, the el Beys did not identify themselves as the Dennises or parties to the\r\naction, Akasha admitted they were not attorneys, and the el Beys did not give the\r\nmaster any reason to believe they had \"a personal stake in the subject matter of the\r\nlawsuit,\" the master correctly concluded they lacked standing. Sea Pines, 345 S.C.\r\n\nat 600, 550 S.E.2d at 291.

Phillips argues the trial court erred in finding: (1)\r\nhis claim was barred by the statute of limitations; (2) Homeowners were not\r\nestopped from raising the statute of limitations as a defense; and (3) the statute of\r\nlimitations should not have been tolled based on the doctrine of equitable tolling.\r\nWe affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities:\r\n\r\n1. As to whether Phillips's claim was barred by the statute of limitations: S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 15-3-530(1) (2005) (providing a three-year limitations period for \"an\r\naction upon a contract, obligation, or liability, express or implied\"); Maher v.\r\nTietex Corp., 331 S.C. 371, 376-77, 500 S.E.2d 204, 207 (Ct.

Specifically, Law Firm maintains that when viewing\r\nevidence in the light most favorable to it, (1) there is evidence Commercial acted\r\noutside the scope of its authority and can be liable for tortious interference with\r\ncontractual relations between BEI and Law Firm and (2) there are genuine issues\r\nof material fact regarding whether Commercial engaged in practices constituting a\r\ntortious interference with Law Firm's contract.

Church for the Lancaster District, appeals the order of the trial\r\ncourt granting summary judgment to trustees of Pine Grove Church, in which the\r\ncourt held Glover failed to prove any ownership interest in the real property of\r\nPine Grove Church.\r\n\r\n(1) We find the trial court did not err in ruling the Book of Discipline of the\r\nA.M.E. Church did not create a trust on behalf of the A.M.E. Church. See All\r\nSaints Parish Waccamaw v. Protestant Episcopal Church in Diocese of S.C., 385\r\nS.C. 428, 442, 685 S.E.2d 163, 171 (2009) (declaring that when resolving church\r\ndispute cases, South Carolina courts are to apply the neutral principles of law\r\napproach as approved by the Supreme Court of the United States in Jones v. Wolf,\r\n443 U.S. 595, 99 S.Ct. 3020, 61 L.Ed.2d 775 (1979)); id. at 444; 685 S.E.2d at 172\r\n(explaining that under the neutral principles of law approach, courts may apply\r\nproperty, corporate, and other forms of law to church disputes); id. at 449, 685\r\nS.E.2d at 174 (finding the \"Dennis Canon,\" which purported to declare a trust in\r\nfavor of the Episcopal Church USA and the Diocese on all real and personal\r\nproperty held by any congregation, had no legal effect on the title to the local\r\ncongregation's property where title was held by the local congregation); id.\r\n(explaining that \"[a] trust 'may be created by either declaration of trust or by\r\ntransfer of property. . . .' It is an axiomatic principle of law that a person or entity\r\nmust hold title to property in order to declare that it is held in trust for the benefit\r\nof another or transfer legal title to one person for the benefit of another.\" (citation\r\nomitted)); S.C. Code Ann. § 62-7-401(a)(2) (Supp. 2013) (\"To be valid, a trust of\r\nreal property, created by transfer in trust or by declaration of trust, must be proved\r\nby some writing signed by the party creating the trust.\"). The Book of Discipline\r\nalone cannot create an express trust. Although it is a writing, it is not signed by the\r\ntrustees of Pine Grove Church. Glover presented no signed documents in which\r\nthe Pine Grove Church trustees consented to the trust provisions. In addition, the\r\nnational A.M.E. Church could not create a trust over the Pine Grove Church\r\nproperty through the Book of Discipline as it did not hold title to that property.\r\n\r\n(2) We find no merit to Glover's assertion that equity demands a constructive trust\r\nbe placed on the Pine Grove Church property for the benefit of the national A.M.E.\r\nChurch as the issue of a constructive trust was not raised to or ruled on by the trial\r\ncourt. Accordingly, the issue is not preserved. See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330\r\nS.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (\"It is axiomatic that an issue cannot be\r\nraised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by\r\nthe trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.\").\r\n\n(3) We find the trial court did not err in denying a continuance to allow Glover to\r\nconduct depositions. See Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 439\r\n(2003) (stating the nonmoving party must demonstrate the likelihood that further\r\ndiscovery will uncover additional relevant evidence and that the party is not merely\r\nengaged in a fishing expedition). At the hearing and in his brief, Glover failed to\r\nidentify any evidence he expected to uncover with the depositions.\r\n\r\n(4) We find no reversible error in the arguments Glover raised at oral argument\r\nconcerning equitable estoppel and part performance to take the matter out of the\r\nstatute of frauds as these issues were never raised to or ruled on by the trial court.\r\nSee Wilder Corp., 330 S.C. at 76, 497 S.E.2d at 733 (\"It is axiomatic that an issue\r\ncannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled\r\nupon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.\").\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, THOMAS, and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-257","title":"Glover v.

Toal, both of Johnson, Toal, &\r\n             Battiste, P.A., of Columbia, for amicus curiae The\r\n             African Methodist Episcopal Church, Inc.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: James Glover, as Presiding Elder of the African Methodist\r\nEpiscopal (A.M.E.) Church for the Lancaster District, appeals the order of the trial\r\ncourt granting summary judgment to representatives of Shady Grove Church, in\r\nwhich the court held Glover failed to prove any ownership interest in the real\r\nproperty of Shady Grove Church.\r\n\r\n(1) We find the trial court did not err in ruling the Book of Discipline of the\r\nA.M.E. Church did not create a trust on behalf of the A.M.E. Church. See All\r\nSaints Parish Waccamaw v. Protestant Episcopal Church in Diocese of S.C., 385\r\nS.C. 428, 442, 685 S.E.2d 163, 171 (2009) (declaring that when resolving church\r\ndispute cases, South Carolina courts are to apply the neutral principles of law\r\napproach as approved by the Supreme Court of the United States in Jones v. Wolf,\r\n443 U.S. 595, 99 S.Ct. 3020, 61 L.Ed.2d 775 (1979)); id. at 444; 685 S.E.2d at 172\r\n(explaining that under the neutral principles of law approach, courts may apply\r\nproperty, corporate, and other forms of law to church disputes); id. at 449, 685\r\nS.E.2d at 174 (finding the \"Dennis Canon,\" which purported to declare a trust in\r\nfavor of the Episcopal Church USA and the Diocese on all real and personal\r\nproperty held by any congregation, had no legal effect on the title to the local\r\ncongregation's property where title was held by the local congregation); id.\r\n(explaining that \"[a] trust 'may be created by either declaration of trust or by\r\ntransfer of property. . . .' It is an axiomatic principle of law that a person or entity\r\nmust hold title to property in order to declare that it is held in trust for the benefit\r\nof another or transfer legal title to one person for the benefit of another.\" (citation\r\nomitted)); S.C. Code Ann. § 62-7-401(a)(2) (Supp. 2013) (\"To be valid, a trust of\r\nreal property, created by transfer in trust or by declaration of trust, must be proved\r\nby some writing signed by the party creating the trust.\"). The Book of Discipline\r\nalone cannot create an express trust. Although it is a writing, it is not signed by the\r\nrepresentatives of Shady Grove. Glover presented no signed documents in which\r\nthe Shady Grove representatives consented to the trust provisions. In addition, the\r\nnational A.M.E. Church could not create a trust over the Shady Grove Church\r\nproperty through the Book of Discipline as it did not hold title to that property.\r\n\n(2) We find no merit to Glover's assertion that equity demands a constructive trust\r\nbe placed on the Shady Grove Church property for the benefit of the national\r\nA.M.E. Church as the issue of a constructive trust was not raised to or ruled on by\r\nthe trial court. Accordingly, the issue is not preserved. See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke,\r\n330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (\"It is axiomatic that an issue cannot\r\nbe raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon\r\nby the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.\").\r\n\r\n(3) We find the trial court did not err in denying a continuance to allow Glover to\r\nconduct depositions. See Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 439\r\n(2003) (stating the nonmoving party must demonstrate the likelihood that further\r\ndiscovery will uncover additional relevant evidence and that the party is not merely\r\nengaged in a fishing expedition). At the hearing and in his brief, Glover failed to\r\nidentify any evidence he expected to uncover with the depositions.\r\n\r\n(4) We find no reversible error in the arguments Glover raised at oral argument\r\nand The African Methodist Episcopal Church, Inc. raised in its amicus brief\r\nconcerning equitable estoppel and part performance to take the matter out of the\r\nstatute of frauds as these issues were never raised to or ruled on by the trial court.\r\nSee Wilder Corp., 330 S.C. at 76, 497 S.E.2d at 733 (\"It is axiomatic that an issue\r\ncannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled\r\nupon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.\").\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, THOMAS, and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-258","title":"State v.

Petitioner did not raise an argument of\r\nper se prejudice at the PCR hearing and this issue was not ruled on by the PCR\r\ncourt. Thus, this issue is not preserved. See Kolle v.

Bolte argues\r\nhis trial counsel's assistance was rendered ineffective when counsel (1) failed to\r\nobject to the solicitor's statements in closing argument that the facts of the case\r\nwere \"undisputed,\" (2) failed to object to the solicitor's remarks in closing\r\nargument that the jury was the \"conscience of the community,\" (3) failed to move\r\nto challenge and strike a certain juror, and (4) failed to object to the trial court's\r\n\"moral certainty\" instruction. Bolte further contends counsel's errors had the\r\ncumulative effect of denying him of effective legal representation to the extent that\r\nprejudice was presumed in his case. We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR,\r\nand the following authorities:\r\n\r\n1.

We affirm.\r\n\r\n(1) We find the trial court did not err in granting the District and the High School\r\nsummary judgment on Doe's negligent supervision claim. See S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n15–78–60(25) (2005) (providing a governmental entity is not liable for a loss\r\nresulting from the \"responsibility or duty including but not limited to supervision,\r\nprotection, control, confinement, or custody of any student, . . . except where the\r\nresponsibility or duty is exercised in a grossly negligent manner . . . \"); Degenhart\r\nv.

Doe presented no evidence that the\r\nDistrict knew or had reason to know of a need to exercise control over Smith to\r\nprevent him from abusing Doe.\r\n\r\n(2) We find Doe's contention the School District and the High School failed to\r\nexercise slight care because it made no effort to offer guidance, accommodation, or\r\nother support to Doe after her suicide attempt is not preserved for appellate review.\r\nSee Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (\"It is\r\naxiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have\r\nbeen raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate\r\nreview.\").\r\n\n(3) We find the trial court did not err in holding the District and the High School\r\nare not liable under a theory of respondeat superior. See S.C. Code Ann. § 15–78–\r\n60(17) (2005) (excluding a governmental entity from liability for a loss resulting\r\nfrom \"employee conduct outside the scope of his official duties or which\r\nconstitutes actual fraud, actual malice, intent to harm, or a crime involving moral\r\nturpitude . . . \"); Froneberger v.

She also failed to challenge the trial court's ruling that all of Doe's claims\r\nagainst the High School fail because the High School did not exist as a separate\r\nlegal entity until 2003. These rulings are the law of the case. See Jones v. Lott,\r\n387 S.C. 339, 346, 692 S.E.2d 900, 903 (2010) (\"Under the two issue rule, where a\r\ndecision is based on more than one ground, the appellate court will affirm unless\r\nthe appellant appeals all grounds because the unappealed ground will become the\r\nlaw of the case.\"); First Union Nat'l Bank of S.C. v. Soden, 333 S.C. 554, 566, 511\r\nS.E.2d 372, 378 (Ct. App. 1998) (holding an \"unchallenged ruling, right or wrong,\r\nis the law of the case and requires affirmance\").\r\n\r\n(5) We find Doe failed to challenge properly the trial court's ruling that her claims\r\nagainst Smith for outrage and punitive damages were barred by the Tort Claims\r\nAct. Her only discussion of this ruling is in a footnote in her brief within the\r\nargument section \"The Respondents owed a duty of care to Doe,\" in which she\r\nstates: \"To the extent Smith was acting outside the scope of his employment by\r\ntaking Doe for rides in his car and tending to Doe after her suicide attempt, the\r\nruling by the trial court barring the claims of outrage and for punitive damages\r\nagainst Smith are in error because those limitations on liability apply only to\r\n\nemployees acting within the scope of their employment.\" See Rule 208(b)(1)(B),\r\nSCACR (\"Ordinarily, no point will be considered which is not set forth in the\r\nstatement of the issues on appeal.\"); Walde v.

Evans, 364 S.C.\r\n42, 50 n.5, 610 S.E.2d 841, 846 n.5 (Ct. App. 2005) (holding that even if a one-\r\nsentence argument could be construed as raising a separate issue on appeal, it was\r\nabandoned for being conclusory and failing to cite any supporting authority).\r\n\r\n(6) We find the trial court did not err in holding Doe's claims were barred by the\r\nstatute of limitations. See Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 341 S.C.\r\n320, 336, 340, 534 S.E.2d 672, 680, 682 (2000) (stating a plaintiff must present at\r\nthe summary judgment stage and at trial independently verifiable, objective\r\nevidence that corroborates a repressed memory claim in order to assert the\r\ndiscovery rule); id. at 335, 534 S.E.2d at 680 (explaining the requirement of\r\ncorroborating evidence \"appropriately balances the plaintiff[']s interest in pursuing\r\na valid claim and the defendant's interest in being able to defend a stale or false\r\nclaim); id. at 335-36, 534 S.E.2d at 680 (noting reasons for the requirement are\r\n\"the disagreement among the psychological and medical communities about the\r\nvalidity of repressed memory syndrome, the danger a plaintiff's memories could be\r\nfaked or implanted during therapy, and the desire that a plaintiff not have the\r\nability to control the running of the statute of limitations solely by allegations\r\nwhose only support is contained within the plaintiff's mind\"); id. at 336, 534\r\nS.E.2d at 680 (listing examples of corroborating evidence that may satisfy the\r\nobjective verifiability requirement as \"(1) an admission by the abuser; (2) a\r\ncriminal conviction; (3) documented medical history of childhood sexual abuse;\r\n(4) contemporaneous records or written statements of the abuser, such as diaries or\r\nletters; (5) photographs or recordings of the abuse; (6) an objective eyewitness's\r\naccount; (7) evidence the abuser had sexually abused others; or (8) proof of a chain\r\nof facts and circumstances having sufficient probative force to produce a\r\nreasonable and probable conclusion that sexual abuse occurred\"). In order to avoid\r\napplication of the statute of limitations, Doe was required to establish\r\nindependently verifiable, objective evidence to corroborate her repressed memory\r\nclaim.

Lee, Jr. (Husband) appeals the order of the family\r\ncourt regarding divorce, alimony, and the equitable division of property. He\r\nargues the family court committed reversible error by (1) failing to award Husband\r\na divorce on the grounds of adultery; (2) awarding alimony to Eileen K. Lee (Wife)\r\nwhen he presented clear evidence of her adultery; (3) granting a mistrial on\r\n\nDecember 15, 2011; (4) incorrectly determining the equitable division of property\r\nand allocation of debt; (5) accepting William Dettmering as an expert witness; and\r\n(6) awarding Wife attorney's fees. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1.     The family court did not err in determining Husband failed to prove Wife\r\ncommitted adultery. See Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C. 412, 414, 709 S.E.2d 666,\r\n667 (2011) (\"In appeals from the family court, this [c]ourt reviews factual and\r\nlegal issues de novo.\"); Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 388, 709 S.E.2d 650, 653\r\n(2011) (holding that in appeals from the family court, the appellate court has the\r\nauthority to find the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of\r\nthe evidence and because the family court is in a superior position to judge the\r\nwitness's demeanor and veracity, its findings should be given broad discretion);\r\nChastain v. Chastain, 381 S.C. 295, 302, 672 S.E.2d 108, 111 (Ct. App. 2009)\r\n(\"Although this court may find facts in accordance with our own view of the\r\npreponderance of the evidence, we are not required to ignore the fact that the trial\r\njudge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their\r\ncredibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.\").\r\n\r\nThe family court found Husband did not provide sufficient evidence of Wife's\r\ntime, opportunity, and inclination to commit adultery. Particularly in light of the\r\nfact that the family court was in the best position to judge the credibility of the\r\nwitnesses, we find no error in the family court's analysis. See Brown v. Brown, 215\r\nS.C. 502, 512-13, 56 S.E.2d 330, 335 (1949) (holding that to obtain a divorce on\r\nthe ground of adultery, the evidence establishing the adultery \"must be clear and\r\npositive, and the infidelity must be established by a clear preponderance of the\r\nevidence. The proof must be sufficiently definite to identify the time and place of\r\nthe offense, and the circumstances under which it was committed.\" (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted)); Nemeth v. Nemeth, 325 S.C. 480, 484, 481 S.E.2d 181,\r\n183 (Ct. App. 1997) (\"[B]ecause adultery is an activity that takes place in private,\r\nthe proof may be, and in fact generally will be, circumstantial. Circumstantial\r\nevidence showing the opportunity and inclination to commit adultery is sufficient\r\nto establish a prima facie case.\" (citation omitted)); Brown v. Brown, 379 S.C. 271,\r\n279, 665 S.E.2d 174, 179 (Ct. App. 2008) (noting that \"without evidence to\r\nsupport a romantic relationship, including love letters, romantic cards, hand-\r\nholding, hugging, kissing, or any other romantic demonstrations or actions between\r\nthe wife and her paramour, adultery was not adequately established\").\r\n\r\n2.    Because the family court concluded Husband did not provide sufficient\r\nevidence of adultery, the family court properly determined Wife was eligible to\r\nreceive alimony. See S.C. Code Ann. § 20-3-130 (2014) (\"In proceedings for\r\n\ndivorce from the bonds of matrimony, and in actions for separate maintenance and\r\nsupport, the court may grant alimony or separate maintenance and support in such\r\namounts and for such term as the court considers appropriate as from the\r\ncircumstances of the parties and the nature of case may be just, pendente lite, and\r\npermanently. No alimony may be awarded a spouse who commits adultery . . . .\");\r\nLide v. Lide, 277 S.C. 155, 157, 283 S.E.2d 832, 833 (1981) (\"Alimony is a\r\nsubstitute for support which is normally incident to the marital relationship and all\r\nfacts and circumstances disclosed by the record should be considered. No one\r\nfactor should be considered dispositive.\").\r\n\r\n3.     The family court properly granted a mistrial on December 15, 2011. See\r\nJones v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 364 S.C. 222, 235, 612 S.E.2d 719, 726\r\n(Ct. App. 2005) (\"An issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must\r\nhave been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate\r\nreview. An issue is not preserved where the trial court does not explicitly rule on\r\nan argument and the appellant does not make a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend\r\nthe judgment.\" (citations omitted)); Webb v. CSX Transp., Inc., 364 S.C. 639, 657,\r\n615 S.E.2d 440, 450 (2005) (stating a contemporaneous objection is required to\r\npreserve issues for appellate review).\r\n\r\n4.     The family court did not commit reversible error in its equitable division of\r\nproperty award and in its allocation of marital debt. See Lewis, 392 S.C. at 384-85,\r\n709 S.E.2d at 651 (holding that although an appellate court has the authority to\r\nmake findings of fact in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the\r\nevidence, it nonetheless \"'should approach an equitable division award with a\r\npresumption that the family court acted within its broad discretion. The family\r\ncourt's award should be reversed only when the appellant demonstrates an abuse of\r\ndiscretion.'\" (quoting Dawkins v. Dawkins, 386 S.C. 169, 172-73, 687 S.E.2d 52,\r\n54 (2010))).\r\n\r\nHusband takes issue with the ruling that he is solely responsible for the $100,000\r\nloan from Wife's brother, James Keithly. However, the family court provided\r\nsufficient support for its ruling. It found Keithly and Husband colluded to lessen\r\nthe equity Wife would receive from the sale of the marital home. It referred to the\r\nfact that the parties had no written agreement between the parties and Husband and\r\nWife had not attempted to repay the loan in the past eight years. Therefore, while\r\nthe circuit court, in a separate proceeding, found there was a valid loan between\r\nKeithly and Husband and Wife, the family court did not err in finding Husband\r\nwas solely responsible for the debt.

Martin, LLC, of Greer,\r\n        for Respondents.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: In this declaratory judgment action involving the availability of\r\nunderinsured motorist (UIM) coverage, Progressive Northern Insurance Company\r\n(Progressive) argues the trial court erred in granting Stanley K. Medlock and Corey\r\nK. Medlock's motion for summary judgment. Specifically, Progressive contends\r\nthe trial court erred by (1) failing to hold that Stanley's signed rejection of optional\r\nUIM coverage bound all other insureds on the policy and (2) failing to treat the\r\naddition of a second vehicle and a second named insured as a \"change\" to the\r\npolicy pursuant to section 38-77-350(C) of the South Carolina Code (2002). We\r\naffirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR.\r\n\r\n1. As to whether the trial court erred in holding that Progressive was required to\r\noffer Corey UIM coverage when Progressive altered his status to a named insured\r\non the insurance policy, we affirm. See McDonald v. S.C. Farm Bureau Ins. Co.,\r\n336 S.C. 120, 124, 518 S.E.2d 624, 626 (Ct. App. 1999) (\"This court's primary\r\nfunction in interpreting a statute is to ascertain the intent of the General Assembly.\r\nA statute must receive a practical and reasonable interpretation consonant with the\r\n'design' of the legislature.\" (citation omitted)); id. (\"Sections 38-77-160 [of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code (2002)] and 38-77-350 [of the South Carolina Code (2002 &\r\nSupp. 2013)] cover the same subject matter, i.e., the offer of optional insurance\r\ncoverages for automobiles, and, therefore, must be construed together and as\r\nexplanatory of each other.\") (quotation marks omitted); § 38-77-160 (\"[Automobile\r\ninsurance carriers] shall . . . offer, at the option of the insured, underinsured\r\nmotorist coverage up to the limits of the insured liability coverage to provide\r\ncoverage in the event that damages are sustained in excess of the liability limits\r\ncarried by an at-fault insured or underinsured motorist or in excess of any damages\r\ncap or limitation imposed by statute.\"); McDonald, 336 S.C. at 123, 518 S.E.2d at\r\n625 (\"If the insurer fails to make a meaningful offer of UIM coverage to the\r\ninsured, the policy will be reformed, by operation of law, to include UIM coverage\r\nup to the limits of liability insurance carried by the insured.\"); § 38-77-350(A)-(C)\r\n(2002 & Supp. 2013) (\"(A) The director or his designee shall approve a form that\r\nautomobile insurers shall use in offering optional coverages required to be offered\r\npursuant to law to applicants for automobile insurance policies. This form must be\r\nused by insurers for all new applicants. . . . (B) If this form is signed by the named\r\ninsured, after it has been completed by an insurance producer or a representative of\r\nthe insurer, it is conclusively presumed that there was an informed, knowing\r\nselection of coverage and neither the insurance company nor an insurance agent is\r\nliable to the named insured or another insured under the policy for the insured's\r\nfailure to purchase optional coverage or higher limits. (C) An automobile insurer\r\nis not required to make a new offer of coverage on any automobile insurance\r\n\npolicy which renews, extends, changes, supersedes, or replaces an existing\r\npolicy.\"); McDonald, 336 S.C. at 124, 518 S.E.2d at 626 (finding that \"[c]learly,\r\nthe legislature intended for insurers to afford all named insured the opportunity to\r\naccept or reject UIM coverage. In using the term 'new applicant,' the legislature\r\nsimply distinguished between those who had never had an opportunity to reject\r\nUIM coverage and others, such as insureds renewing policies, who previously had\r\nmade informed decisions about UIM coverage\") (emphasis added); see also Gov't\r\nEmps. Ins. Co. v. Draine, 389 S.C. 586, 594, 698 S.E.2d 866, 870 (Ct. App. 2010)\r\n(confirming McDonald's holding that the term \"new applicant\" means one who has\r\nnever had the opportunity to reject UIM coverage).\r\n\r\n2. As to whether the trial court erred in failing to recognize Progressive was not\r\nrequired to offer Corey UIM coverage pursuant to section 38-77-350(C) because\r\nCorey's altered status was merely a change in the insurance policy, we affirm. See\r\nMcDonald, 336 S.C. at 125, 518 S.E.2d at 626 (\"'If [section] 38-77-350(C) were\r\ninterpreted to relieve [carrier] of the general requirement of offering [the insured]\r\nunderinsured motorist coverage up to the liability limits of the policy, it would\r\namount to an absolute repeal of § 38-77-160, which mandates that an automobile\r\ninsurer offer underinsured motorist coverage up to the limits of the insured's\r\nliability coverage. Where [s]ection 38-77-350(C) states the insured is not required\r\nto make a new offer, it clearly envisions the circumstances where the insurer has\r\nalready made an old offer.'\" (alterations by court) (quoting Ackerman v.

Boscia, III, MD,\r\nUpstate Lung & Critical Care Specialists, PC, (Upstate Lung) and Devendra\r\nShantha, MD, brought this action against Respondents William Mark Casey, Ray\r\nE. (\"Chuck\") Thompson, and Charles M. Fogarty for abuse of process and civil\r\nconspiracy. Upon Respondents' motions to dismiss, the circuit court dismissed\r\nthese claims with prejudice. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY1\r\n\r\nFeldman and Boscia are physicians and partners in Upstate Lung, and Shantha is\r\nan anesthesiologist. In 2006, Thompson, an attorney, filed an action on Casey's\r\nbehalf against Appellants, alleging that Feldman, Boscia, and Shantha breached the\r\napplicable standard of care regarding medical treatment they provided to Casey\r\nand that Casey suffered permanent brain damage and became permanently disabled\r\nas a result of the alleged breach. While the case was pending, Shantha was granted\r\nsummary judgment and dismissed as a defendant. The case was tried in May 2010,\r\nand on May 28, 2010, the jury returned a verdict for Feldman, Boscia, and Upstate\r\nLung.\r\n\r\nOn October 27, 2010, Appellants filed this action against Respondents for abuse of\r\nprocess and civil conspiracy arising from the prior lawsuit. According to the\r\ncomplaint, Fogarty was another pulmonologist who had ended a business\r\nrelationship with Feldman on hostile terms and surreptitiously treated Casey while\r\nthe malpractice action was pending. The treatment allegedly included arranging\r\nfor Casey to obtain an MRI under a fictitious name and date of birth.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Because this case was decided on a motion to dismiss, the facts as stated here are\r\nrestricted to the allegations of the complaint and are assumed to be true for the\r\npurpose of our review of the grant of the motion to dismiss. See Overcash v. S.C.\r\nElectric & Gas Co., 364 S.C. 569, 572, 614 S.E.2d 619, 620 (2005) (\"A motion to\r\ndismiss a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, must be based solely on the\r\nallegations set forth on the face of the complaint.\").\r\n\nInstead of filing responsive pleadings, Respondents each moved to dismiss the\r\ncomplaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP. Appellants subsequently amended\r\ntheir pleadings twice. After Appellants filed their second amended complaint,\r\nRespondents filed separate motions to dismiss. The circuit court held a hearing on\r\nthe motions. When the hearing commenced, the parties agreed to a dismissal\r\nwithout prejudice of Appellants' civil conspiracy claim, and oral argument\r\nproceeded on only the abuse of process claim. The circuit court later issued an\r\norder granting Respondents' motions to dismiss Appellants' second amended\r\ncomplaint, holding the three-year statute of limitations had expired before\r\nAppellants filed their lawsuit. In addition to dismissing with prejudice Appellants'\r\nclaim for abuse of process, the circuit court also barred Appellants from re-\r\nasserting their claim for civil conspiracy at any time in the future. Appellants\r\nmoved to alter or amend the circuit court's order and for leave to amend their\r\ncomplaint once again. The circuit court denied these motions, and Appellants filed\r\nthis appeal.\r\n\r\n1.    Appellants first argue the circuit court misapplied the discovery rule in\r\ndismissing their complaint for abuse of process. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"In deciding a motion to dismiss pursuant to [Rule] 12(b)(6), SCRCP, the trial\r\ncourt should consider only the allegations set forth on the face of the plaintiff's\r\ncomplaint.\" Plyler v. Burns, 373 S.C. 637, 645, 647 S.E.2d 188, 192 (2007). In\r\nreviewing a decision on whether to dismiss an action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6),\r\nSCRCP, \"the appellate tribunal applies the same standard of review that was\r\nimplemented by the trial court.\" Williams v. Condon, 347 S.C. 227, 233, 553\r\nS.E.2d 496, 500 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\n\r\n\"The essential elements of abuse of process are (1) an ulterior purpose, and (2) a\r\nwillful act in the use of the process that is not proper in the regular conduct of the\r\nproceeding.\" Pallares v. Seinar, 407 S.C. 359, 370, 756 S.E.2d 128, 133 (2014).\r\nAbuse of process claims are subject to a three-year statute of limitations. Whitfield\r\nConstr. Co. v. Bank of Tokyo Trust Co., 338 S.C. 207, 222 n.18, 525 S.E.2d 888,\r\n896 n.18 (Ct. App. 1999). This period begins to run when the plaintiff \"knew or by\r\nthe exercise of reasonable diligence should have known that he had a cause of\r\naction.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 15-3-535 (2005).\r\n\r\nIn dismissing Appellants' claim for abuse of process, the circuit court found\r\nAppellants' abuse of process claim arose in 2006, when the medical malpractice\r\naction against them was filed. According to the appealed order, Appellants not\r\n\nonly knew Casey and Thompson had filed the lawsuit against them, they believed\r\nthe lawsuit was for a purpose other than to redress legitimate medical injuries,\r\nnamely, to obtain prescription pain medication and disability benefits. The\r\nparagraphs of the complaint cited by the circuit court to support this finding,\r\nhowever, do not give any indication as to when Appellants knew or should have\r\nknown either that Casey was obtaining narcotic drugs and disability benefits as a\r\nresult of the pending medical malpractice action or that Casey filed the lawsuit\r\nwith this objective. Furthermore, even if the complaint indicates Appellants had\r\nreason to believe the medical malpractice action was filed with Respondents'\r\nknowledge that it was based on spurious allegations, Appellants' complaint does\r\nnot allege any specific point in time at which Respondents committed a willful and\r\nimproper act in their use of the legal process. Without any information in\r\nAppellants' complaint as to when any such acts allegedly occurred, we hold the\r\nallegations in the complaint do not support a finding that Appellants could be\r\ncharged with knowledge that they had a potential abuse of process claim at the\r\ntime the malpractice action against them was filed. See Hainer v. Am. Med. Int'l,\r\nInc., 328 S.C. 128, 136, 492 S.E.2d 103, 107 (1997) (\"There is no liability [in an\r\nabuse of process action] where the defendant has done nothing more than carry out\r\nthe process to its authorized conclusion, even though with bad intentions.\"); id. at\r\n136-37, 492 S.E.2d at 107 (\"Abuse of process requires both an ulterior purpose and\r\na willful act not proper in the regular course of the proceeding.\"). We therefore\r\nhold the allegations of Appellants' complaint do not support a finding that their\r\naction for abuse of process was barred by the statute of limitations and remand for\r\nfurther proceedings on this cause of action.2\r\n\r\n2.      Appellants argued in their brief that because Respondents had agreed to a\r\ndismissal of the conspiracy claim without prejudice, the circuit court erred in\r\ndismissing this cause of action with prejudice. Appellants, however, failed to raise\r\nthis issue in their motion to alter or amend; therefore, the issue is not preserved for\r\nappeal. See In re Timmerman, 331 S.C. 455, 460, 502 S.E.2d 920, 922 (Ct. App.\r\n1998) (\"When a party receives an order that grants certain relief not previously\r\ncontemplated or presented to the trial court, the aggrieved party must move,\r\npursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to alter or amend the judgment in order to\r\npreserve the issue for appeal.\"). Furthermore, at oral argument, Appellants'\r\n\r\n\r\n2 Our reversal of the dismissal of Appellants' abuse of process claim is without\r\nprejudice to Respondents to move again for dismissal of this cause of action once\r\nthe case is remanded to the circuit court.\r\n\ncounsel indicated that he no longer intended to pursue a claim for conspiracy\r\nagainst Respondents.\r\n\r\n3.     Appellants also challenge the circuit court's finding that equitable tolling did\r\nnot apply to their claims and the circuit court's refusal to grant them leave to amend\r\ntheir complaint to advance additional factual allegations that would clarify the\r\nrelevant timeline as it related to the discovery rule and the statute of limitations. In\r\nview of our decision to reverse the dismissal of Appellants' abuse of process claim\r\nand remand this matter to the circuit court for further proceedings, we decline to\r\naddress these arguments.

McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335\r\nS.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling an appellate court need not\r\nreview remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the\r\nappeal).\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, THOMAS, and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-274","title":"Hubbard v.

Drawdy, of Byrholdt Drawdy, LLC, of\r\n            Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: David G. Hubbard (Husband) filed this action against Gail D.\r\nHubbard, seeking a divorce, equitable apportionment of marital property, and other\r\nrelief. The family court granted a divorce, apportioned the marital property 50/50,\r\n\nand ordered each party to be responsible for his or her own attorney's fees.\r\nHusband appeals, arguing the family court erred in the following rulings: (1)\r\nincluding a certificate of deposit (CD) worth $100,000 in the marital estate; (2)\r\nfinding $110,000 in cash in the parties' home safe was marital property; and (3)\r\napportioning the marital estate 50/50. We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR,\r\nand the following authorities:\r\n\r\n1.     As to Husband's argument the family court erred in including the CD in the\r\nmarital estate, we find the parties' actions during their marriage demonstrate they\r\nintended the CD to be marital property. See Wilburn v. Wilburn, 403 S.C. 372,\r\n384, 743 S.E.2d 734, 740 (2013) (\"Property that is nonmarital when acquired may\r\nbe transmuted into marital property if it becomes so commingled with marital\r\nproperty that it is no longer traceable, is titled jointly, or is used by the parties in\r\nsupport of the marriage or in some other way that establishes the parties' intent to\r\nmake it marital property.\"); Peterkin v. Peterkin, 293 S.C. 311, 313, 360 S.E.2d\r\n311, 313 (1987) (finding husband's non-marital property was transmuted into\r\nmarital property because the asset and the income generated therefrom was used in\r\nsupport of the marriage).\r\n\r\n2.     As to Husband's argument the family court erred in finding $110,000 in cash\r\nin the parties' home safe was marital property, we find no error. See S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 20-3-630 (2014) (\"'[M]arital property' . . . means all real and personal\r\nproperty which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is\r\nowned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation . . . .\"); Lewis\r\nv.

Smith argues the circuit court\r\n\nerred in affirming the Board's decision because (1) the decision was rendered in\r\nviolation of due process; (2) the decision violated the Teacher Employment and\r\nDismissal Act1; (3) substantial evidence did not support the decision; and (4) the\r\ncircuit court did not identify supporting facts and legal conclusions in reaching its\r\ndecision. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1. We find the Board's decision did not violate Smith's due process rights. See\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 59-25-470 (Supp. 2013) (\"The teacher has the privilege of being\r\npresent at the hearing with counsel and of cross-examining witnesses and may\r\noffer evidence and witnesses and present any and all defenses to the charges. The\r\nboard shall order the appearance of any witness requested by the teacher.\"); Brown\r\nv. S.C. State Bd. of Educ., 301 S.C. 326, 328, 391 S.E.2d 866, 867 (1990) (\"The\r\n[F]ourteenth [A]mendment Due Process Clause requires procedural due process be\r\nafforded an individual deprived of a property or liberty interest by the State.\"); id.\r\nat 329, 391 S.E.2d at 867 (\"The right to hold specific employment and the right to\r\nfollow a chosen profession free from unreasonable governmental interference\r\ncome within the liberty and property interests protected by the Due Process\r\nClause.\"); id. (\"Procedural due process often requires confrontation and cross-\r\nexamination of one whose word deprives a person of his or her livelihood.\");\r\nBrown v. James, 389 S.C. 41, 53, 697 S.E.2d 604, 610-11 (Ct. App. 2010) (\"The\r\nobservance of the procedural requirements of the [Teacher] Employment and\r\nDismissal Act is mandatory and not a matter of discretion.\"). We find hearsay\r\nevidence, including statements from students and parents detailing specific\r\ncomplaints about Smith, was improperly admitted. However, we find the improper\r\nadmission of this evidence was harmless because the statements were merely\r\ncumulative to the testimony presented at the hearing of the three principals of the\r\nschools that employed Smith; the Horry County Superintendent of Education; and\r\ntwo parents. See Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 305, 486 S.E.2d 750, 758 (1997)\r\n(\"The improper admission of hearsay is reversible error only when the admission\r\ncauses prejudice[; however, w]here the hearsay is merely cumulative to other\r\nevidence, its admission is harmless.\").\r\n\r\n2. We find the Board's decision did not violate the Teacher Employment and\r\nDismissal Act because Smith was given notice the superintendent had\r\nrecommended her employment be terminated and Smith was afforded an\r\nopportunity to be heard prior to her dismissal. See S.C. Code Ann. § 59-25-430\r\n\r\n\r\n1   See S.C. Code Ann. §§ 59-25-410 to -530 (Supp. 2013).\r\n\n(2004) (\"Any teacher may be dismissed at any time who shall fail, or who may be\r\nincompetent, to give instruction in accordance with the directions of the\r\nsuperintendent, or who shall otherwise manifest an evident unfitness for teaching;\r\nprovided, however, that notice and an opportunity shall be afforded for a hearing\r\nprior to any dismissal.\"). Additionally, we find the proper procedures were\r\nfollowed because the matter was brought to Smith's attention in writing and Smith\r\nwas given a reasonable time for improvement within the statute. See S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 59-25-440 (Supp. 2013) (\"Whenever a superior, principal, where\r\napplicable, or supervisor charged with the supervision of a teacher finds it\r\nnecessary to admonish a teacher for a reason that he believes may lead to, or be\r\ncited as a reason for, dismissal or cause the teacher not to be reemployed he shall:\r\n(1) bring the matter in writing to the attention of the teacher involved and make a\r\nreasonable effort to assist the teacher to correct whatever appears to be the cause of\r\npotential dismissal or failure to be reemployed and, (2) except as provided in § 59-\r\n25-450, allow reasonable time for improvement.\").\r\n\r\n3. We find the Board's decision to terminate Smith's employment with the Horry\r\nCounty School District was supported by testimony from the following parties: the\r\nthree principals of the schools that employed Smith; the Horry County\r\nSuperintendent of Education; and two parents. Accordingly, we find substantial\r\nevidence supported the Board's decision. See Laws v. Richland Cnty. Sch. Dist.\r\nNo. 1, 270 S.C. 492, 495-96, 243 S.E.2d 192, 193 (1978) (\"'Substantial evidence' is\r\nnot a mere scintilla of evidence nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of\r\nthe case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow\r\nreasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached or\r\nmust have reached in order to justify its action.\").\r\n\r\n4. Based upon our review of the record, we find the circuit court and the Board\r\nproperly identified supporting facts and legal conclusions in upholding the\r\nsuperintendent's recommendation to terminate Smith's employment. See Porter v.\r\nS.C. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 333 S.C. 12, 21, 507 S.E.2d 328, 332 (1998) (\"'An\r\nadministrative body must make findings which are sufficiently detailed to enable [a\r\nreviewing court] to determine whether the findings are supported by the evidence\r\nand whether the law has been applied properly to those findings.'\" (quoting Hamm\r\nv.
