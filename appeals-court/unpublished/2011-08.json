Armstrong, of Pawleys Island, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  This appeal from the Administrative Law Court (ALC) arises out of the issuance\r\n  of a solid waste management permit from the South Carolina Department of Health\r\n  and Environmental Control (the Department) to Appellant MRR Highway 92, LLC\r\n  (MRR).Â  Respondent Engaging and Guarding Laurens County's Environment (EAGLE)\r\n  requested a contested case hearing after the Department decided not to conduct\r\n  a final review conference regarding the issuance of the permit.Â  The ALC\r\n  reversed the Department's decision and denied the permit, finding the proposed\r\n  facility was not needed.Â  MRR appealed from the decision of the ALC, arguing\r\n  the ALC did not have jurisdiction and the ALC erred in reversing the decision\r\n  of the Department issuing a demonstration of need.Â  We find the request for a\r\n  contested case hearing was timely filed.Â  We reverse the decision of the ALC\r\n  and reinstate the decision of the Department because the Department acted\r\n  within its discretion by declining to consider additional factors in issuing a\r\n  demonstration of need to MRR.Â  See S.C.

As to whether\r\n  the trial court erred in denying Coleman's motion to quash the carjacking\r\n  indictment: Patrick v.

As\r\n  to whether the trial court erred in admitting evidence of medical treatment\r\n  prescribed to Coleman's victims:Â  State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 62, 502\r\n  S.E.2d 63, 69 (1998) (holding that malice is &quot;the wrongful intent to\r\n  injure another and indicates a wicked or depraved spirit intent on wrongdoing&quot;); State v.

Â \r\n3. As\r\n  to whether the trial court erred in denying Coleman's directed verdict motion: State\r\n    v.

Jackson, of Clinton, for Guardian ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Julie M. (Mother) appeals from the family\r\n  court's permanency planning order awarding custody of her child (Child) to\r\n  relatives and relieving the South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS)\r\n  from providing treatment services for her. Â Mother argues the family court\r\n  erred in finding DSS made reasonable efforts to provide treatment services that\r\n  would assist in her in remedying the cause of Child's placement in foster\r\n  care.Â  We affirm.[1] \r\n We find a\r\n  preponderance of the evidence supports the family court's holding that DSS made\r\n  reasonable efforts to provide treatment services that would assist Mother in\r\n  remedying the cause of Child's placement in foster care.[2]Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-1640 (Supp. 2010) (identifying several factors\r\n  for the family court to consider when making a determination of reasonable\r\n  efforts).Â  Here, it was in Child's best interests for DSS to forgo reasonable\r\n  efforts to provide further treatment services for Mother because of Mother's\r\n  failure to complete the goals of her treatment plan as well as the necessity of\r\n  providing a stable placement that could address Child's special-needs\r\n  requirements.Â  A review of the record indicates DSS provided treatment services\r\n  for Mother in the form of parenting classes and living and parenting skills\r\n  training from a disability advocate.Â  However, Mother failed to complete her\r\n  living and parenting skills training despite the disability advocate's repeated\r\n  efforts to schedule appointments with her.Â  Additionally, DSS, the disability\r\n  advocate, and the GAL all expressed strong concerns about Mother's capacity to\r\n  care for Child, especially given Child's special-needs issues and Mother's\r\n  inability to comprehend and apply the information she learned in order to\r\n  properly care for Child without endangering Child's safety.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  family court did not err in finding DSS made reasonable efforts to provide\r\n  treatment services for Mother.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The family court &quot;must make specific written\r\n  findings in support of its conclusion&quot; to either terminate or continue\r\n  reasonable efforts.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-1640(F) (Supp. 2010).Â  We note the\r\n  family court failed to include specific written findings supporting its\r\n  decision to terminate reasonable efforts.Â  When an order of the family court\r\n  violates Rule 26(a), SCRFC, by failing to set forth specific findings of fact\r\n  and conclusions of law, this court may remand the matter to the family court or\r\n  make its own findings of fact in accordance with the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence if the record is sufficient to allow such a review.Â  Griffith v.\r\n    Griffith, 332 S.C. 630, 646-47, 506 S.E.2d 526, 535 (Ct.

Johnson, of\r\n  Manning, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This case\r\n  involves family disputes stemming from the father's probate estate.Â  The\r\n  surviving siblings disagreed about who should serve as personal representative,\r\n  seeking both formally and informally to remove each other or appoint an\r\n  alternative sibling.Â  The probate court removed the motions to remove and\r\n  appoint a personal representative to circuit court.Â  One sibling, Gene Belk,\r\n  also filed an action in circuit court complaining about a trust created for his\r\n  mother after his father's death by the same attorney who drafted his father's\r\n  will, M.M. Weinberg.Â  Weinberg filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and\r\n  attached two affidavits. Â The circuit court retained Gene and his sister, Linda\r\n  Harris, as co-personal representatives and appointed a third sibling, Patricia\r\n  Schmid, as special administrator.Â  The court granted Weinberg's motion to\r\n  dismiss, treating it as a summary judgment motion.Â  The court denied Gene's\r\n  post-trial motions.\r\nGene\r\n  appeals arguing the circuit court (1) lacked subject matter jurisdiction to\r\n  appoint a special administrator, (2) erred in converting the Rule 12(b)(6),\r\n  SCRCP motion into a Rule 56, SCRCP summary judgment motion, (3) should have\r\n  heard a motion to compel discovery before the motion to dismiss, and (4) erred\r\n  in granting the motion to dismiss.[1]Â \r\n  We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities:\r\nAs to\r\n  whether the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction:Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  62-1-302(d)(1) (Supp. 2010) (allowing removal from probate to circuit court of\r\n  &quot;formal proceedings for the probate of wills and for the\r\n  appointment of general personal representatives&quot; (emphasis added)); Dema\r\n    v.

McKinney, of Greenville, for\r\n          Appellant.\r\n        Reid Sherard and Timothy Madden, both of\r\n          Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The City of Greenville (the City) appeals the circuit\r\n  court's grant of partial summary judgment in favor of Morris Communications\r\n  Company, LLC, d/b/a Fairway Outdoor Advertising (Fairway), which effectively\r\n  made void the City's ordinance regarding the amortization of billboards.[1]Â \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1993, the City passed a\r\n  billboard amortization ordinance that allowed for amortization of billboards\r\n  without the payment of compensation to the sign owner.Â  In 1996, the City\r\n  repealed this ordinance.Â  In early 2005, the South Carolina legislature\r\n  introduced legislation that would prevent local governments from amortizing\r\n  private billboard properties without compensation to the owner.Â  On May 9, 2005,\r\n  the City enacted the ordinance at issue in this litigation. Â The ordinance\r\n  purported to repeal the 1996 ordinance that had repealed the 1993 ordinance,\r\n  thereby reinstating the right of the City to amortize billboards without\r\n  compensation.Â  The ordinance stated the 1993 ordinance had remained in effect\r\n  from the time of its passage until the passage of the 2005 ordinance.Â  \r\nThe proposed state\r\n  legislation was ratified but vetoed by Governor Mark Sanford.Â  The veto was\r\n  overridden, and the law became effective on February 22, 2006, as the &quot;South\r\n  Carolina Landowner and Advertising Protection and Property Valuation Act,&quot;\r\n  sections 39-14-10 to -40 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010) (the Act).Â  \r\nThe Act provides &quot;[a]\r\n  local governing body may enact or amend an ordinance of general applicability\r\n  to require the removal of any nonconforming, lawfully erected off-premises\r\n  outdoor advertising sign only if the ordinance requires the payment of just\r\n    compensation to the sign owners . . .&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  39-14-30(B)(2) (emphasis added).Â  As enacted, Section 6 of the Act provided:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Time Effective - SECTION 6. This act takes effect upon\r\n    approval by the Governor. Nothing in this act preempts or otherwise alters,\r\n    modifies, applies to, or effects relocation or removal of any off-premises\r\n    outdoor advertising signs pursuant to an ordinance or regulation enacted by a\r\n    local governing body prior to April 14, 2005. It is the intent of the General\r\n    Assembly that nothing in this act may be construed to\r\n    require the payment of monetary compensation for any off-premises outdoor\r\n    advertising signs relocated or removed pursuant to an ordinance enacted before\r\n    the effective date of this act unless the ordinance otherwise requires the\r\n    payment of monetary compensation.\r\n\r\nAfter the passage of the Act,\r\n  the City attempted to amortize certain of Fairway's billboards without\r\n  compensation.Â  Fairway filed a declaratory judgment action against the City to\r\n  have the ordinance stricken from the City Code.Â  In the alternative, Fairway\r\n  requested a permanent injunction and also alleged an inverse condemnation cause\r\n  of action and unconstitutional takings in violation of the state and federal\r\n  constitutions.Â  Fairway filed a motion for partial summary judgment as to the\r\n  declaratory judgment action.Â  The City filed a document entitled &quot;Motion\r\n  for Summary Judgment&quot; as well.Â  The circuit court granted Fairway's motion\r\n  finding the plain language of the Act rendered all amortization ordinances\r\n  illegal and holding the effective date section of the Act related to removals\r\n  that occurred before the effective date, not ordinances passed prior to that\r\n  time.Â  The circuit court further found the City's interpretation of the Act's\r\n  effective date section would transform the Act into unconstitutional special\r\n  legislation because it would treat municipalities differently.Â  The City filed\r\n  a motion for reconsideration, which was denied.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; The\r\n  Act and the Ordinance\r\nThe City argues the time\r\n  effective section of the Act states compensation ordinances enacted prior to\r\n  the effective date of the legislation are not affected by the Act.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;The issue of\r\n  interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the court.Â  [The appellate\r\n  court] is free to decide questions of law with no particular deference to the\r\n  lower court.&quot;Â  Jeter v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 369 S.C. 433, 438,\r\n  633 S.E.2d 143, 146 (2006) (citations omitted). Â &quot;The\r\n  determination of legislative intent is a matter of law.&quot;Â  Eagle\r\n    Container Co., LLC v. Cnty. of Newberry, 379 S.C. 564, 568, 666 S.E.2d 892,\r\n  894 (2008) (quoting Charleston Cnty. Parks &amp; Recreation Comm'n v. Somers,\r\n  319 S.C. 65, 67, 459 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1995)).Â  &quot;All rules of statutory construction\r\n  are subservient to the one that legislative intent must prevail if it can be\r\n  reasonably discovered in the language used, and that language must be construed\r\n  in light of the intended purpose of the statute.&quot;Â  McClanahan\r\n    v. Richland Cnty. Council, 350 S.C. 433, 438, 567 S.E.2d 240, 242 (2002).Â \r\n  The language in a statute should be construed in a way that reflects the\r\n  statute's intended purpose.Â  Nelson v. Ozmint, 390 S.C. 432, 436, 702\r\n  S.E.2d 369, 371 (2010).Â  &quot;A statute as a whole must receive practical,\r\n  reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant with the purpose, design, and\r\n  policy of lawmakers.&quot;Â  Sloan v. S.C. Bd. of Physical Therapy Exam'rs,\r\n  370 S.C. 452, 468, 636 S.E.2d 598, 606 (2006).Â  \r\nThe time effective section\r\n  of the enacting legislation is ambiguous.Â  It is unclear whether the removal of\r\n  signs is prohibited after a certain date or whether the passage of new &quot;no\r\n  compensation&quot; ordinances is the prohibited action.Â  Further complicating\r\n  matters, two dates, April 15, 2005, and the effective date of the legislation,\r\n  which was ultimately February 22, 2006, are cited.Â  Because the language used\r\n  in the second and third sentences of this section is ambiguous, we must attempt\r\n  to ascertain the legislature's intent and construe any ambiguity in a way that\r\n  reconciles it with the Act's overall purpose.Â  \r\nIn this case, section (B) of\r\n  the Act makes clear the legislature disfavors the amortization of billboards\r\n  without just compensation to the owners.Â  Interpreting the Act to allow local\r\n  governments to continue amortizing billboards without just compensation under\r\n  previously enacted ordinances does not comport with the overall intent of the\r\n  Act, which is aimed at protecting the property interests of sign owners. Â Furthermore, if the time effective section referred to a cutoff\r\n  date for the passage of no-compensation ordinances, nothing would have\r\n  prevented all local jurisdictions from hurriedly passing no-compensation\r\n  ordinances.Â  Such action would have rendered the Act completely ineffective,\r\n  and we are charged with construing legislation in a manner that does not lead\r\n  to an absurd result.Â  SeeKiriakides v. United Artists Commc'ns, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366\r\n  (1994) (holding the court should reject a meaning when to accept it would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it could not\r\n  have been intended by the legislature).Â  Therefore, we construe the second\r\n  sentence of the time effective section as banning the removal or relocation of\r\n  signs prior to April 15, 2005, under a no-compensation ordinance.Â  \r\nThe same\r\n  principles that lead to our interpretation of the second sentence are\r\n  applicable to a construction of the last sentence of the time effective\r\n  section.Â  Again, to interpret the last sentence to permit the continued\r\n  existence of no-compensation ordinances would conflict with the overall purpose\r\n  of the Act.Â  Consequently, two possible interpretations of the final sentence emerge:\r\n  (1) it prohibits the removal or relocation of signs after the time effective\r\n  date of the Act or (2) it simply clarifies for sign owners that the passage of\r\n  the Act does not entitle them to seek compensation for signs already removed\r\n  under a previously existing no-compensation ordinance.Â  In other words, the\r\n  statute is not retroactive.Â  The first interpretation is incongruent with our\r\n  construction of the second sentence in this section finding April 15, 2005, to\r\n  be the cutoff date for the removal or relocation of signs.Â  Therefore, the\r\n  second construction is most reasonable and is in keeping with the overall\r\n  purpose of the Act.Â  Local governments cannot continue operating under no-compensation\r\n  ordinances, and sign owners cannot use the Act to seek compensation for prior\r\n  amortizations that were accomplished without just compensation.[2]\r\nBecause we\r\n  conclude the time effective section of the Act does not permit the continuing\r\n  existence of no-compensation ordinances, we find the circuit court did not err\r\n  in holding the City's ordinance was preempted by the Act.Â  Furthermore, because we interpret the Act in such a way as to\r\n  preempt the City's amortization ordinance, we not need address the circuit\r\n  court's findings regarding special legislation and we need not determine\r\n  whether the unconventional way in which the ordinance was passed rendered it\r\n  void.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335\r\n  S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not\r\n  address remaining issues when the determination of a prior issue is dispositive\r\n  of the appeal).\r\nII.&nbsp; Failure\r\n  to Grant Summary Judgment\r\nThe City also urges this\r\n  court to find the circuit court erred in failing to grant summary judgment in\r\n  its favor on Fairway's remaining causes of action.Â  We decline to address this\r\n  issue.Â  \r\nThe parties disagree to some\r\n  extent on whether the City's pleading entitled &quot;Motion for Summary\r\n  Judgment&quot; actually seeks summary judgment as to the other causes of action\r\n  alleged by Fairway: permanent injunction, inverse condemnation cause of action,\r\n  and unconstitutional takings in violation of the state and federal\r\n  constitutions.Â  However, we need not determine whether the City sought summary\r\n  judgment on those issues because the denial of those motions would be\r\n  unappealable.Â  See Olson v. Faculty House of Carolina, Inc., 354\r\n  S.C. 161, 168, 580 S.E.2d 440, 444 (2003) (reaffirming the denial of a motion\r\n  for summary judgment is unappealable).\r\nFor all of the foregoing\r\n  reasons the order of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J., and SHORT and\r\n  KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Amortization of\r\n  billboards means requiring the removal or relocation of non-conforming\r\n  billboards within a certain period of time.\r\n[2] Under either interpretation\r\n  of the last sentence, the City's case fails as the signs at issue were not\r\n  removed before the effective date of the Act, nor is Fairway seeking\r\n  compensation for an amortization that was concluded prior to the effective date\r\n  of the Act.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-385","title":"State v.

Guerard, Jr. and Charles S.\r\n          Goldberg, both of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Lucinda\r\n  Pringle (Decedent) passed away on October 11, 1989.Â  Decedent had five\r\n  daughters:Â  Janine Gourdine; Annabell Thornton; Emma Smalls; Mary P. Smith; and\r\n  Evelina Brown.Â  Evelina Brown predeceased her mother in 1987. Janine Gourdine\r\n  filed a petition in the probate court indicating Decedent died with &quot;no\r\n  will&quot; on May 5, 1999.Â  Subsequently, the probate court issued an order\r\n  stating &quot;the above captioned Case and/or Cause is closed and final\r\n  discharge entered, with leave to restore upon good cause being shown . . .\r\n  .&quot;Â  On October 20, 2005, Evelina's children, Appellants Evelina Brown\r\n  Moses, Thomas Brown, Jr., and Rebecca Patricia Brown, filed a petition for\r\n  recovery of the improper distribution of Decedent's estate based upon the\r\n  discovery of an allegedly fraudulently concealed will.Â  The probate court\r\n  dismissed Appellants' petition, finding section 62-3-108 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (2009) operated as an absolute bar to Appellants' claims.Â  The circuit\r\n  court affirmed.Â  We reverse and remand.[1]\r\n1. As to Appellants'\r\n  argument that the probate court and the circuit court erred in failing to\r\n  reopen the estate, we first find the probate court's unappealed finding of good\r\n  cause shown is the law of the case.Â  See Harris Teeter, Inc. v. Moore &amp; Van Allen, PLLC, 390 S.C. 275, 282 n.5, 701 S.E.2d 742, 745 n.5\r\n  (2010) (noting an unappealed ruling is the law of the case).Â  Further, Appellants\r\n  have set forth allegations of extrinsic fraud, which constitute good cause to\r\n  reopen the estate.Â  Decedent was predeceased by one of her five daughters,\r\n  Evelina Brown, the mother of Appellants.Â  One by one, Decedent's other\r\n  daughters lived their lives and passed away, until the last surviving daughter\r\n  confessed to Evelina's children that she and her sisters had hidden the\r\n  existence of the will in order to live out their lives on the property Decedent\r\n  intended Appellants to inherit from her last will and testament.Â  Thus, the\r\n  evidence supports the finding of the probate court that there is good cause to\r\n  reopen the estate.Â  See Chewning v. Ford Motor Co., 354 S.C. 72,\r\n  81, 579 S.E.2d 605, 610 (2003) (defining extrinsic fraud as &quot;fraud that\r\n  induces a person not to present a case or deprives a person of the opportunity\r\n  to be heard&quot;).Â  Second, the Probate Code permits modification or vacation\r\n  of an order for good cause shown.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-1008 (2009)[2] (&quot;If other property of the estate is discovered after an estate has been\r\n  settled and the personal representative discharged or for other good cause, the\r\n  court upon petition of any interested person and upon notice as it directs may\r\n  appoint the same or a successor personal representative to administer the\r\n  subsequently opened estate.&quot;); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-413\r\n  (2009) (&quot;For good cause shown, an order in a formal testacy proceeding may\r\n  be modified or vacated within the time allowed for appeal.&quot;).Â  Third, we\r\n  interpret section 62-3-108 of the South Carolina Code (2009) to prevent the commencement of an action to probate an estate more than ten years after the decedent's\r\n  death.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-108 (&quot;No informal probate or\r\n  appointment proceeding . . . may be commenced more than ten years after the\r\n  decedent's death . . . .&quot;); cf. Robinson v. Estate of Harris,\r\n  388 S.C. 616, 622-25, 698 S.E.2d 214, 218-19 (2010) (finding section 15-67-90\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (2005) is not an absolute bar where there are\r\n  allegations of extrinsic fraud).Â  Because the law of the case is that\r\n  Appellants have demonstrated good cause to reopen the estate and the\r\n  administration of the estate was timely commenced pursuant to section 62-3-108,\r\n  we reverse and remand to the probate court for further proceedings consistent\r\n  with this opinion.\r\n2. As to Appellants'\r\n  argument that the probate court and circuit court erred in finding submission\r\n  of the will was not timely where no order closing the estate had been issued, we\r\n  disagree with Appellants' argument that the estate has not been closed because\r\n  the court has not issued an order according to section 62-3-1001 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (2009).[3] Â We construe the language of section 62-3-1001 as permissive and not\r\n  mandatory.Â  See S.C. Code Ann.

McDuffie Stone, III, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Aljaquon\r\n  Drake appeals his convictions on two counts of first-degree burglary.Â  On\r\n  appeal, he argues the trial court erred in: \r\n(1) denying his motions for\r\n  directed verdict and (2) consolidating the burglaries into one trial.Â  We\r\n  affirm.[1]\r\n1.Â  We hold\r\n  the trial court properly denied Drake's motions for directed verdict on both\r\n  burglaries. Â The victims of the burglaries testified their houses\r\n  were burglarized and items were stolen, and Drake had possession of or was near\r\n  the stolen items shortly after the period of time during which the burglaries\r\n  could have been committed.Â  See State v. Irvin, 270 S.C. 539,\r\n  543, 243 S.E.2d 195, 197 (1978) (finding testimony as to the occurrence of the\r\n  burglary together with testimony as to the accused's possession of the stolen\r\n  items form &quot;a sufficient basis from which the [accused]'s guilt could be\r\n  fairly and logically deduced, thus requiring the submission of the case to the\r\n  jury&quot;); State v. Nall, 304 S.C. 332, 336, 404 S.E.2d. 202, 205 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1991) (&quot;The evidence is sufficient to go to the jury if, viewed in\r\n  the light most favorable to the State, a rational trier of fact could find the\r\n  essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot;).\r\n2.Â  We hold\r\n  the trial court did not abuse its discretion in consolidating the two\r\n  burglaries into one trial. Â Both houses burglarized were secluded, located\r\n  within walking distance from each other; the burglaries took place within a few\r\n  hours; small, inexpensive items were stolen from each; and no prejudice\r\n  resulted to Drake's substantive rights, thus meeting the standard for consolidating\r\n  offenses for trial.Â  See State\r\n    v.

(Mother) and David S. (Father) both appeal the termination of parental\r\n  rights (TPR) to their two minor children by the family court.Â  We affirm.\r\nThe grounds for TPR must be\r\n  proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v.\r\n    Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  On appeal from the family court, this court reviews\r\n  factual and legal issues de novo.&nbsp; Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C. 412,\r\n  414, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011); see Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381,\r\n  386, 709 S.E.2d 650, 652 (2011).&nbsp; Although this court reviews the family\r\n  court's findings de novo, we are not required to ignore the fact that the trial\r\n  court, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate\r\n  their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.&nbsp; Lewis,\r\n  392 S.C. at 385, 709 S.E.2d at 652.&nbsp; The burden is upon the appellant to\r\n  convince this court that the family court erred in its findings.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n&quot;In appeals from the\r\n  family court, the appellate court has the authority to find the facts in\r\n  accordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence.&quot;&nbsp; Ex\r\n    parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 61, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652 (2006).&nbsp; &quot;This\r\n  broad scope of review does not, however, require the appellate court to\r\n  disregard the findings of the family court.&quot;&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\n  &quot;This degree of deference is especially true in cases involving the\r\n  welfare and best interests of a minor child.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 62, 624\r\n  S.E.2d at 652.\r\nFATHER'S APPEAL\r\nFather argues the family\r\n  court violated his due process rights by: (1) denying his motion to continue so\r\n  that he could testify after his criminal proceedings were complete; (2) denying\r\n  his motion to continue so he could obtain a psychosexual evaluation; and (3)\r\n  finding he failed to remedy the conditions that caused removal of his children\r\n  although he could not afford to pay for a psychosexual evaluation.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Father argues the family court erred by finding he willfully failed to support\r\n  his children.\r\nI.Â  First Motion to\r\n  Continue\r\nFather argues the family\r\n  court violated his due process rights when it denied his motion to continue so\r\n  he could testify without invoking his right to remain silent.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;If good and sufficient\r\n  cause for continuance is shown, the continuance may be granted by the\r\n  court.&quot;Â  Rule 40(i)(1), SCRCP. Â &quot;The grant or denial of a continuance\r\n  is within the sound discretion of the family court and its ruling will not be\r\n  reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  Dep't of Soc.\r\n    Servs. v. Laura D., 386 S.C. 382, 385, 688 S.E.2d 130, 132 (Ct. App. 2009).\r\nWe find the family court had\r\n  a substantial basis to deny the motion.Â  First, Father was present at the hearing\r\n  and was represented by counsel.Â  His decision not to testify was therefore\r\n  tactical and did not implicate either the state or federal constitutions.Â  See S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Walter, 369 S.C. 384, 387-88, 631 S.E.2d\r\n  913, 914 (Ct. App. 2006) (upholding the family court's denial of a motion to\r\n  continue where a father chose not to testify during a removal hearing due to\r\n  pending sexual abuse charges).Â  Second, the\r\n  Department of Social Services (DSS) intended to question Father about his\r\n  failure to submit to a psychosexual evaluation and not the issues surrounding\r\n  his pending criminal charges.Â  Thus, Father would not have had to invoke his\r\n  right to remain silent.Â  Third, the family court, over the objection of DSS,\r\n  allowed counsel for Father to proffer Father's testimony.Â  Thus, Father's\r\n  version of events was before the court.Â  Lastly, at the time of the hearing,\r\n  the minor children had been in foster care for approximately twenty-seven\r\n  months, and were entitled to a final decision in order to allow adoption\r\n  proceedings to commence.Â  Accordingly, we do not believe the family court\r\n  abused its discretion in denying the motion.Â  See Laura D., 386\r\n  S.C. at 385, 688 S.E.2d at 132.Â Â  \r\nII.Â Â Second Motion to\r\n  Continue\r\nFather argues the family\r\n  court violated his due process rights when it denied his motion to continue in\r\n  order to obtain a psychosexual evaluation.Â  We disagree.\r\nDSS clearly demonstrated\r\n  Father was aware for approximately twenty-three months he was required to\r\n  submit to an evaluation.Â  Nothing in the record indicates Father was more\r\n  likely to submit to the evaluation had the family court granted the\r\n  continuance.Â  Accordingly, we find the family court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion in denying the motion.Â  See Laura D., 386 S.C. at 385, 688 S.E.2d at 132.\r\nIII.Â  Failure to Remedy\r\n  Conditions\r\nFather argues the family\r\n  court violated his due process rights and erred when it found he failed to\r\n  remedy the conditions which led to the removal of his children.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Father maintains he could not afford the psychosexual evaluation; therefore, he\r\n  was deprived of his liberty interest in the care and custody of his children\r\n  based on his status as an indigent.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;Parental rights warrant\r\n  vigilant protection under the law and due process mandates a fundamentally fair\r\n  procedure when the state seeks to terminate the parent-child\r\n  relationship.&quot;Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Cochran, 364 S.C. 621,\r\n  626, 614 S.E.2d 642, 645 (2005).\r\nFather correctly argues he\r\n  has a fundamental interest at stake.Â  Id. Â However, this interest is not\r\n  absolute.Â  See id. at 626-27, 614 S.E.2d at 645 (holding the best\r\n  interest of the child outweighs the parent's fundamental interest in the care,\r\n  custody, and management of their children); see also Hooper v.\r\n    Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 294, 513 S.E.2d 358, 365 (1999) (&quot;Courts\r\n  uniformly have concluded that, while parents have a constitutionally protected\r\n  liberty interest in the care and custody of their children, that right is not\r\n  absolute.&quot;).Â  \r\nFather analogizes the denial\r\n  of an indigent to access of a state-funded psychiatrist during a death penalty\r\n  trial to DSS's denial of funds for his psychosexual evaluation.Â  See Ake\r\n    v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68, 76-80 (1985) (holding it is a violation of due\r\n  process to deprive an indigent defendant access to a state-funded psychiatrist\r\n  where the defendant's sanity at the time of the offense is a significant factor\r\n  in the trial).Â  We believe this case is distinguishable because the minor\r\n  children's interest in protection from harm overrides Father's liberty\r\n  interest.Â  See Hooper, 334 S.C. at 294, 513 S.E.2d at 365\r\n  (holding child protection and removal cases are fundamentally different than a\r\n  typical criminal case).\r\nMoreover, Father has not\r\n  cited any case requiring DSS to provide all necessary means to achieve the\r\n  goals of the treatment plan and the South Carolina Children's Code does not\r\n  indicate a legislative intent to place this burden on DSS.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§Â§ 63-7-1670, -1680 (2010 &amp; Supp. 2010).\r\nFinally, Father had two years\r\n  to submit to an evaluation.Â  During that time he voluntarily quit his job and,\r\n  when it behooved him, he was able to raise $3,000 in bail money in two weeks.Â \r\n  However, he was not able to raise half that amount in two years despite\r\n  repeated warnings from DSS that failure to do so would result in TPR.Â  DSS was\r\n  not required to ensure a successful outcome.Â  See McCutcheon v. Charleston\r\n    Co. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 302 S.C. 338, 343, 396 S.E.2d 115, 118 (Ct. App.\r\n  1990).Â  Accordingly, we find Father's due process rights were not violated.\r\nIV.Â  Failure to SupportÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFather argues the family\r\n  court erred by finding he willfully failed to support his minor children.Â  We\r\n  decline to address this issue because it is not necessary for the disposition\r\n  of this case.Â  See Stinecipher v. Ballington, 366 S.C. 92, 100\r\n  n.6, 620 S.E.2d 93, 98 n.6 (Ct. App. 2005) (stating once one statutory ground\r\n  is met, this court need not address whether any other ground for TPR has been\r\n  proven).[1]\r\nMOTHER'S APPEAL\r\nWith regard to Mother's\r\n  issues on appeal, we affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the\r\n  following authorities:\r\n1. As to whether the family court erred in finding Mother failed to remedy\r\n  the conditions leading to her children's removal:Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570\r\n  (2010) (providing the family court may terminate parental rights when TPR is in\r\n  the child's best interests and the child has been removed from the parent and\r\n  has been out of the home for a period of six months following the adoption of a\r\n  placement plan by court order or by agreement between the department and the\r\n  parent, and the parent has not remedied the conditions which caused the removal); Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Pritchett, 296 S.C. 517, 520, 374 S.E.2d 500,\r\n  501 (Ct. App. 1988) (emphasis in original) (&quot;[A]n attempt to remedy\r\n  alone is [not] adequate to preserve parental rights. Otherwise, the statute\r\n  would be couched in such terms. The attempt must have, in fact, remedied the conditions.&quot;).\r\n  Â Â \r\n2.Â As\r\n  to whether the family\r\n  court erred in determining TPR was in the children's best interests:Â  Doe v. Roe, 386 S.C. 624, 634, 690 S.E.2d 573, 579 (2010)\r\n  (&quot;Overturning the family court's decision to terminate [parent's] rights\r\n  clearly conflicts with the TPR statute's purpose to make a child eligible for\r\n  adoption by someone 'who will provide a suitable home environment and the love\r\n  and care necessary for a happy, healthful, and productive life.'&quot; (quoting\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2510 (2010))); S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Smith,\r\n  343 S.C. 129, 133, 538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct.

Threlkeld, of Anderson, for Appellants.\r\nWendell L. Hawkins, of Greer, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Eric and Lisa Autenrieth (the Autenrieths)\r\n  appeal from the trial court's order granting summary judgment to Curtis Lollis,\r\n  Robert Baldree, and Excell Investments, Inc. (collectively, Respondents).Â  The\r\n  Autenrieths argue the court erred in granting summary judgment to Respondents\r\n  because (1) there are issues of fact for the jury to decide on their causes of\r\n  action in unjust enrichment and conversion; (2) they are entitled to\r\n  prejudgment interest; (3) they are entitled to attorney's fees; and (4) there\r\n  are questions of fact about the identity of Respondents.Â  We\r\n  affirm[1] and remand the case to the trial court for a hearing on damages.[2]\r\n1.&nbsp; The Autenrieths entered into a\r\n  construction contract with Respondents to build a home for them for $665,950.Â \r\n  Simultaneously with the execution of the contract and prior to construction,\r\n  the Autenrieths paid Respondents $33,297.50 to be used to begin construction of\r\n  their home.Â  However, the next month, the Autenrieths told Respondents they no\r\n  longer wanted to continue with the construction of their home and demanded an accounting\r\n  and refund of all unearned funds from Respondents.Â  The Autenrieths claim\r\n  Respondents only sustained $6,800 in damages because of their breach of\r\n  contract, and they are entitled to a return of the remainder of the earnest\r\n  money.Â  They assert Respondents will be unjustly enriched if Respondents retain\r\n  more of their earnest money than they are entitled to retain.Â  However, the\r\n  Autenrieths had a contract with Respondents and they paid Respondents pursuant\r\n  to the contract, which they then breached.Â  Thus, we find the trial court\r\n  correctly granted Respondents' motion for summary judgment on this cause of\r\n  action.Â  See Dema v. Tenet Physician Servs.-Hilton Head, Inc.,\r\n  383 S.C. 115, 123, 678 S.E.2d 430, 434 (2009) (stating unjust enrichment is an\r\n  equitable doctrine that permits a plaintiff to recover benefits or money that,\r\n  in justice and equity, belongs to him or her and a defendant has retained at\r\n  the expense of the plaintiff); Earthscapes Unlimited, Inc. v. Ulbrich,\r\n  390 S.C. 609, 616, 703 S.E.2d 221, 225 (2010) (noting absent an express\r\n  contract, our courts have recognized quantum meruit, based on quasi-contract,\r\n  as an equitable doctrine to allow recovery for unjust enrichment); Gignilliat\r\n    v. Gignilliat, Savitz &amp; Bettis, L.L.P., 385 S.C. 452, 467, 684 S.E.2d\r\n  756, 764 (2009) (holding to prevail on a cause of action for quantum meruit, a\r\n  plaintiff must show (1) a benefit was conferred by the plaintiff upon the\r\n  defendant; (2) realization of that benefit by the defendant; and (3) retention\r\n  of the benefit by the defendant under circumstances that make it inequitable\r\n  for him to retain it without paying its value); id. (requiring the\r\n  plaintiff to prove actual damages resulting from the wrongful retention of\r\n  benefits by the defendant).Â  \r\n2.&nbsp; The Autenrieths claim they are\r\n  entitled to have all funds in excess of $6,800 returned to them and allege Respondents'\r\n  refusal to return the funds constitutes conversion.Â  However, the record\r\n  reveals no evidence Respondents wrongfully assumed and exercised the right of\r\n  ownership over the Autenrieths' money.Â  Pursuant to the construction contract,\r\n  the Autenrieths were required to pay Respondents five percent as a down\r\n  payment.Â  In his deposition, Eric Autenrieth testified he voluntarily gave\r\n  Respondents the money to enter into the contract and use as a first draw to\r\n  begin building his home.Â  He further testified that Respondents would not have\r\n  begun to build the home had he not paid them the money, and he wanted them to\r\n  begin building his home at that time.Â  He also admitted he unilaterally\r\n  terminated the contract, and Respondents did not agree to the termination.Â \r\n  Additionally, at the hearing on the Autenrieths' motion for reconsideration, the\r\n  Autenrieths' attorney conceded they breached the contract.Â  Therefore, the Autenrieths\r\n  did not have title or right to possession of the property at the time of the\r\n  alleged conversion, as required to establish a cause of action for conversion.Â \r\n  Thus, we find the trial court correctly granted Respondents' motion for summary\r\n  judgment on this claim.Â  See Moore v. Benson, 390 S.C. 153, 162,\r\n  700 S.E.2d 273, 278 (Ct. App. 2010) (defining conversion as the unauthorized\r\n  assumption and exercise of the rights of ownership over goods or personal\r\n  chattels belonging to another, to the alteration of their condition or to the\r\n  exclusion of the rights of the owner); Jenkins v. Few, 391 S.C. 209,\r\n  218, 705 S.E.2d 457, 461 (Ct. App. 2010) (stating that conversion may arise by\r\n  illegal use or misuse, or by illegal detention of another's chattel); Mackela\r\n    v. Bentley, 365 S.C. 44, 48, 614 S.E.2d 648, 650 (Ct. App. 2005) (holding a\r\n  plaintiff may prevail upon a claim for conversion by showing the unauthorized\r\n  detention of the property, after a demand); Gignilliat, 385 S.C. at 465,\r\n  684 S.E.2d at 763 (requiring a plaintiff to establish either title to or right\r\n  to the possession of the personal property at the time of the conversion to\r\n  establish the tort of conversion); Mackela, 365 S.C. at 48, 614 S.E.2d\r\n  at 650 (&quot;A plaintiff's claim for conversion fails where the defendant\r\n  proves a legal right to the property.&quot;).\r\n3.&nbsp; The Autenrieths assert the\r\n  contract was signed by Respondent Curtis Lollis, on behalf of Excell Builders,\r\n  which is not a legal entity.Â  Thus, they assert it is a question of fact as to the\r\n  identity of Excell Builders.Â  In his deposition, Eric Autenrieth testified that\r\n  when he purchased his lot, he was given a list of approved builders that listed\r\n  Excell Builders as a builder, and he thought Excell Builders was a\r\n  corporation.Â  The top of the construction contract was titled, &quot;Excell\r\n  Builders Construction Contract,&quot; and it was signed by Curt Lollis, as\r\n  Excell Builders.Â  Additionally, when asked about Defendants' Exhibit 3, which\r\n  was not provided in the record on appeal, Eric Autenrieth testified the\r\n  document listed Curt Lollis as Vice President of Excell Builders, and Lollis\r\n  was not acting in his individual capacity.Â  Therefore, the Autenrieths did not\r\n  present any evidence that revealed they believed they were dealing with any of\r\n  the officers of Excell Builders in their individual capacity rather than as a\r\n  corporation.Â  Thus, we find the trial court did not err in dismissing Lollis\r\n  and Baldree individually from the action.Â Â Â  \r\n4.&nbsp; We need not address the\r\n  Autenrieths' remaining arguments pertaining to prejudgment interest and\r\n  attorney's fees because we affirm the trial court's order granting summary\r\n  judgment to Respondents on the Autenrieths' causes of action for unjust\r\n  enrichment and conversion.Â  See Futch v.

Stilwell, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2011-UP-393&nbsp;\r\nHeard May 3, 2011 â€“ Filed August 18, 2011 \r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nRachel D.

Murray Kinard, of\r\n  Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM: This is an appeal from the circuit court's reversal of Rocco\r\n  Capodanno's conviction for driving under the influence.Â  We reverse and\r\n  reinstate the conviction because the ruling the circuit court found to be\r\n  erroneous was a ruling in favor of Capodanno.Â  Therefore, Capodanno was not\r\n  aggrieved by the ruling, and his conviction cannot be reversed on that basis.\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; Facts and Procedural History\r\n\r\nCapodanno\r\n  was arrested on March 17, 2006, and charged with driving under the influence by\r\n  South Carolina highway patrolman M.F. Mars.Â  At the time of the arrest, Mars's\r\n  patrol car video equipment was inoperable; therefore, he did not videotape the incident\r\n  site as required by section 56-5-2953(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006).[1]Â \r\n  However, Capodanno submitted to a breathalyzer test that was videotaped.Â  The\r\n  magistrate judge assigned to the trial set a discovery deadline pursuant to\r\n  Rule 5, SCRCrimP.Â  Mars failed to comply with the deadline.Â  Capodanno filed a\r\n  motion for discovery sanctions based on Mars's failure to comply with the deadline\r\n  set by the magistrate.Â  The magistrate granted the motion, but did not dismiss\r\n  the case as requested by Capodanno.Â  Rather, the magistrate sanctioned the\r\n  State by ruling that the State could not introduce the breath test site video.Â \r\n  The magistrate's ruling did not prevent Capodanno from introducing the breath\r\n  test site video, but his attorney &quot;elected not to put it in&quot;\r\n  evidence.Â  The magistrate prohibited Capodanno from either cross-examining Mars\r\n  about the discovery sanction or arguing to the jury about it.Â  \r\nCapodanno\r\n  also made a motion to dismiss based on Mars's failure to video the incident site\r\n  pursuant to section 56-5-2953.Â  Mars submitted an affidavit, as required by\r\n  section 56-5-2953(B),[2] stating that he could not film Capodanno's arrest because he previously removed\r\n  the camera from his patrol car for repairs.Â  Capodanno argued the affidavit was\r\n  insufficient because it did not show &quot;reasonable attempts had been made to\r\n  put [the camera] in working order.&quot;Â  The magistrate denied the motion.Â  At\r\n  trial, Mars gave Capodanno documents relating to the attempted repairs of the\r\n  camera.Â  Capodanno asked for a continuance &quot;to explore this issue,&quot;\r\n  but the magistrate denied the motion.\r\nCapodanno\r\n  was convicted of driving under the influence.Â  He appealed the conviction to\r\n  the circuit court arguing the magistrate should have (1) granted the motion to\r\n  dismiss for failure to provide a copy of the breath test site video in discovery\r\n  pursuant to Rule 5 and Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87-88 (1963), (2)\r\n  granted the motion to dismiss for failure to video the incident site pursuant\r\n  to section 56-5-2953, (3) granted a continuance when Mars provided discovery relating\r\n  to the repairs of the patrol car camera shortly before trial, and (4) allowed\r\n  Capodanno to make arguments regarding the absence of the breath test site video.\r\nThe circuit\r\n  court's order stated there was only one issue before itâ€”&quot;Was exclusion of\r\n  the [breath test] room video tape but allowance of [the breath test] results\r\n  proper?&quot;Â  This issue relates only to the magistrate's ruling on\r\n  Capodanno's motion for a discovery sanction.Â  The magistrate's ruling on this\r\n  motion had two components.Â  First, the magistrate ruled in favor of the State\r\n  by refusing to dismiss the case as a sanction for the discovery violation.Â \r\n  Second, the magistrate ruled in favor of Capodanno by prohibiting the State\r\n  from introducing the breath test site video.Â  As Capodanno conceded at the\r\n  hearing before the circuit court, he was not prejudiced by the component of the\r\n  ruling prohibiting the State from introducing the breath test site video\r\n  because he had the right to introduce the video himself.Â  However, Capodanno\r\n  made the strategic decision not to put it in evidence.Â  At the hearing before\r\n  the circuit court, the following exchange occurred between the circuit judge\r\n  and Capodanno's attorney:\r\n\r\n[The\r\n  Court:]Â  So my question to you is this, . . . : Notwithstanding the fact that\r\n  the magistrate judge suppressed the videotape evidence, did you still have the\r\n  opportunity to introduce that as evidence in the case?\r\nBecause\r\n  let me tell you what I am dealing with here: Is it a due process issue, that\r\n  your defendant was not afforded the ability to appropriately confront his\r\n  accusers, or was it a trial tactic?Â  That is, did you decide &quot;I don't want\r\n  that tape in,&quot; or was it something that was just handed to you and you had\r\n  to deal with it?\r\n[Defense\r\n  Counsel]: Well, clearly, Your Honor, I think I'd be disingenuous if I said that\r\n  we didn't have the ability to put that tape in.Â  I mean, I â€“ clearly the judge\r\n  had ruled that the tape was suppressed, that they couldn't use it, but I think,\r\n  clearly, I could have â€“ if I chose to go put that tape in, I could have done\r\n  that, and just exposed myself to whatever issues might have come from that.Â  \r\nBut,\r\n  you know â€“ so I guess &quot;yes&quot; would be the answer to your question, I\r\n  elected not to put it in, when perhaps I could have put it in.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Capodanno was\r\n  not prejudiced by the component of the magistrate's ruling preventing the State\r\n  from introducing the video.Â  Capodanno was prejudiced only to the extent the\r\n  magistrate refused to dismiss the entire case as a discovery sanction.\r\nNevertheless,\r\n  the circuit court judge found the magistrate erred by excluding the breath test\r\n  site video while allowing the admission of the results.Â  The circuit court\r\n  determined &quot;[t]he appropriate remedy was either suppression of the [breath\r\n  test] results along with the tape or no suppression at all.&quot;Â \r\n  Additionally, the court found &quot;it was error not to allow the defendant to\r\n  comment on the lack of a video tape at roadside or in the [breath test] room.&quot;Â \r\n  The court granted a new trial and remanded the case to magistrate court.\r\nThe\r\n  State now appeals arguing (1) the circuit court applied an incorrect standard\r\n  of review, (2) it was within the magistrate's discretion to exclude the breath\r\n  test site video and admit the results, and (3) Capodanno did not preserve the\r\n  issue of his inability to comment on the lack of an incident site video, and\r\n  even if it is preserved, he has not shown a prejudicial or harmful error\r\n  resulting therefrom.Â  Because we find the circuit court judge erred in\r\n  reversing a ruling in favor of the defendant, we do not reach issues (1) and\r\n  (2).Â  As to issue (3), we agree with the State.\r\nII.&nbsp; Exclusion of the Breath Test Site Video and Admittance of the Results\r\nA party\r\n  may appeal a ruling or judgment only if he is aggrieved by it.Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 18-1-30 (1985).Â  &quot;A person is 'aggrieved by the judgment or decree when\r\n  it operates on his rights of property or bears directly upon his interest, the\r\n  word aggrieved referring to a substantial grievance, . . . or the imposition on\r\n  a party of a burden or obligation.'&quot;Â  Burns v. Gardner, 328 S.C.\r\n  608, 617, 493 S.E.2d 356, 361 (Ct. App. 1997) (quoting Bivens v. Knight,\r\n  254 S.C. 10, 13, 173 S.E.2d 150, 152 (1970)).Â  Here, the magistrate's ruling\r\n  prohibiting the State from introducing the breath test site video was a ruling\r\n  in Capodanno's favor.Â  Therefore, Capodanno was not aggrieved by the ruling.[3]Â \r\n  Accordingly, Capodanno could not appeal it, and it was error for the circuit\r\n  court to reverse.Â  See Cisson v. McWhorter, 255 S.C. 174, 177-78,\r\n  177 S.E.2d 603, 605 (1970) (&quot;Our statutory provision limiting appellate\r\n  review to those who have been aggrieved by the judgment below is, in our\r\n  opinion, a wise and well reasoned requirement, as our court is concerned with\r\n  correcting errors that have practically wronged the appealing party.&quot;); Brode\r\n    v. Brode, 278 S.C. 457, 458, 298 S.E.2d 443, 444 (1982) (dismissing appeal\r\n  pursuant to section 18-1-30 because appellate review is limited &quot;to\r\n  parties aggrieved by judgments or decrees.&quot;).\r\n\r\nIII.&nbsp; Prohibition on Testimony Concerning the Lack of an Incident and\r\n  Breath Test Site Videos\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court ruled the magistrate erred by not allowing Capodanno to comment\r\n  on the lack of an incident site video.Â  We disagree that the magistrate made\r\n  this ruling.Â  Rather, the magistrate did allow Capadanno to comment on the lack\r\n  of an incident site video.Â  In the transcript of the appeal hearing in circuit\r\n  court, Capodanno said the magistrate &quot;did not allow [him] to argue that,\r\n  you know, basically, 'Where is the video from the car?'&quot;Â  However, upon\r\n  further questioning by the circuit judge, Capodanno's attorney said: &quot;I\r\n  don't remember what I did say. Â . . . I don't think I could, in good faith,\r\n  represent to the Court exactly what I was limited from arguing or wasn't\r\n  limited to arguing, except to the extent I do recall not being able to argue\r\n  everything I wanted to argue.&quot;Â  The magistrate's return stated: &quot;The\r\n  Court did allow an argument to be made regarding the lack of videotaping\r\n  equipment in the patrol car.&quot;Â  In the supplemental return the magistrate\r\n  wrote: &quot;I did allow Mr. Kinard to cross-exam[ine] Trooper Mars on the\r\n  matter [the video equipment and its repair] and argue this in his\r\n  closing.&quot;\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court's order first concludes as a matter of law that &quot;the\r\n  Defendant was limited and/or prevented from cross-examining the Trooper or\r\n  making arguments in his closing remarks relating to the Trooper's failure to\r\n  produce the [breath test] room video tape.&quot;Â  (emphasis added).Â \r\n  However, the order then finds &quot;it was error not to allow the defendant to\r\n  comment on the lack of a video tape at roadside or in the [breath test]\r\n  room.&quot;Â  (emphasis added).\r\nBecause\r\n  the magistrate did not prohibit cross-examination or closing argument comment\r\n  on the absence of the incident site video, it was error to reverse Capodanno's\r\n  conviction on this basis.\r\nFinally,\r\n  as to the magistrate's decision that Capodanno could not comment on the lack of\r\n  a breath test site video, we affirm.Â  The circuit court reversed that decision\r\n  because it concluded section 56-5-2953(B) &quot;specifically contemplates that\r\n  the defendant would have the ability to comment on the lack of video tape\r\n  evidence.&quot;Â  The magistrate's decision to exclude the breath test video and\r\n  prohibit comment on its absence was based on a discovery violation, not on\r\n  section 56-5-2953(B).Â  Therefore, the circuit court erred in reversing that\r\n  decision.\r\n\r\nIV.&nbsp; Conclusion\r\nBecause\r\n  the circuit court erred in reversing a ruling in favor of the appealing party,\r\n  concluding that the magistrate did not allow Capodanno to comment on the lack\r\n  of an incident site video, and reversing the prohibition on comment concerning\r\n  the absence of a breath test site video, we reverse and reinstate the\r\n  conviction.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nFEW, CJ., PIEPER and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Because Capodanno's arrest occurred in March 2006, the 2006 version of section\r\n  56-5-2953 is applicable to this case.\r\n[2] Section 56-5-2953(B) states in part: \r\n\r\nFailure\r\n  by the arresting officer to produce the videotapes required by this section is\r\n  not alone a ground for dismissal . . . if the arresting officer submits a sworn\r\n  affidavit certifying that the videotape equipment at the time of the arrest . .\r\n  . was in an inoperable condition, stating reasonable efforts have been made to\r\n  maintain the equipment in an operable condition . . . .\r\n\r\n[3] This is supported by the fact that Capodanno did not appeal the ruling in his\r\n  Notice of Appeal.Â  Rather, the circuit court judge raised the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-394","title":"State v.

Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co.,&nbsp;228 S.C. 67, 76, 88 S.E.2d 844,\r\n  848&nbsp;(1955).Â  An employee may recover for the aggravation of a pre-existing\r\n  condition only &quot;where there is a dormant condition which has produced no\r\n  disability but which becomes disabling by reason of the aggravating injury.&quot;Â  Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co.,&nbsp;360 S.C. 276, 295, 599 S.E.2d 604,\r\n  614&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  However, a condition is not compensable when &quot;it\r\n  is due solely to the natural progression of a pre-existing condition.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nHere, substantial\r\n  evidence supports the circuit court's decision to affirm the Appellate Panel's\r\n  finding that Whitaker's work-related injury aggravated his pre-existing left\r\n  hip condition. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5)(e) (Supp. 2010)\r\n  (providing this court will affirm the factual findings of the Appellate Panel\r\n  if supported by substantial evidence); see also Hargrove,&nbsp;360\r\n  S.C. at 295, 599 S.E.2d at 614 (&quot;A determination of whether a claimant's\r\n  condition was accelerated or aggravated by an accidental injury is a factual\r\n  matter for the Appellate Panel.&quot;).Â  Although Whitaker presented evidence\r\n  that he suffered from a pre-existing condition, no evidence exists showing that\r\n  the pre-existing condition was active. Â In fact, the evidence presented\r\n  supports a finding that the pre-existing condition was dormant because Whitaker\r\n  testified that he did not have any pain after his doctor's appointment in 2005.Â \r\n  Dr. McAvoy also testified that Whitaker did not complain of pain during his\r\n  follow-up appointment in December 2005.Â  Moreover, evidence exists to support\r\n  the finding the work-related injury aggravated Whitaker's pre-existing hip\r\n  condition.Â  Namely, Dr. McAvoy opined Whitaker's work-related injury\r\n  accelerated his condition requiring him to have hip replacement surgery sooner\r\n  than expected. Â Accordingly, substantial evidence exists supporting the finding\r\n  that Whitaker's work-related accident aggravated his pre-existing hip condition. \r\n2.&nbsp; We\r\n  find Employer's argument that the circuit court erred in affirming the\r\n  Appellate Panel's order because the Appellate Panel failed to make specific\r\n  factual findings concerning the necessity of Whitaker's hip replacement surgery\r\n  is without merit.[2] Â The single commissioner's order held Employer responsible for\r\n  Whitaker's left hip replacement surgery because the injury by accident\r\n  aggravated his pre-existing condition.Â  Additionally, the Appellate Panel\r\n  addressed the issue, finding the need for hip replacement surgery was\r\n  accelerated due to the work-related fall because Whitaker was not experiencing\r\n  any hip pain prior to the injury.Â  Because the Appellate Panel made specific factual\r\n  findings concerning this issue, we affirm.Â  See Nettles v.\r\n    Spartanburg School Dist. # 7, 341 S.C. 580, 590, 535 S.E.2d 146,\r\n  151&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000) (&quot;The [Appellate Panel] must make specific findings of fact upon which a claimant's right to compensation are\r\n  based.&quot;).\r\nII.&nbsp; Whitaker's Appeal\r\n We hold the circuit\r\n  court properly affirmed the Appellate Panel's decision to award Whitaker a partial\r\n  lump sum payment.Â  When reviewing the Appellate Panel's decision concerning\r\n  lump sum payments, the reviewing court must review the decision for an abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  Thompson v. S.C. Steel Erectors,&nbsp;369 S.C. 606, 612,\r\n  632 S.E.2d 874, 878&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).Â  &quot;An abuse of discretion occurs\r\n  if the [Appellate Panel]'s findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence or\r\n  the conclusions reached are controlled by an error of law.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Section\r\n  42-9-301 of the South Carolina Code (1976) permits the award of lump sum\r\n  payments for workers' compensation benefits when the Appellate Panel determines\r\n  the payment is not contrary to the best interest of the employee or it will\r\n  prevent undue hardship on the employer without prejudicing the employee's\r\n  interests.\r\n Here, the Appellate\r\n  Panel found the award of a partial lump sum payment and periodic payments for\r\n  the remaining amount were in Whitaker's best interests.Â  In making this\r\n  determination, the Appellate Panel cited to Whitaker's testimony concerning his\r\n  financial obligations as well as to its concerns regarding potential reductions\r\n  by social security or other disability benefits for his lump sum payment.Â \r\n  Additionally, Whitaker explained he wanted a lump sum payment in order to\r\n  satisfy his financial debts of $28,000 on his home mortgage, $5,000 in credit\r\n  cards, and $2,000 for his car.Â  The\r\n  Appellate Panel's award of $40,000 in lump sum payment covered all of these\r\n  expenses and provided Whitaker with an extra $5,000.Â  The Appellate Panel also awarded Whitaker a lump sum\r\n  payment for his attorney's fees.Â  Consequently, with the two lump sum payment\r\n  awards, Whitaker can satisfy all of his reported debts. Accordingly, the\r\n  Appellate Panel's award did not constitute an abuse of discretion. \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n SHORT,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] We decline to address this issue because it is not\r\n  preserved for our review.

Kevin Holmes, both of Charleston, for\r\n  Appellant.\r\nKirsten Leslie Barr, of Mount Pleasant, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â  In this workers' compensation case, Jason\r\n  Roy Peek appeals the circuit court's order that affirmed the decision of the Appellate\r\n  Panel of the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission (the Appellate\r\n  Panel) to award Peek permanent partial disability for his back injury.Â  Peek\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in: (1) affirming the Appellate Panel's decision\r\n  even though the Appellate Panel's order failed to make sufficient findings of\r\n  fact concerning whether Peek suffered permanent total disability under section\r\n  42-9-30(21) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010); (2) making its own\r\n  findings of fact concerning whether Peek suffered from permanent total\r\n  disability under section 42-9-30(21); and (3) denying Peek a lump sum payment\r\n  for his disability benefits.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\n1.&nbsp; We find the circuit court\r\n  properly affirmed the Appellate Panel's decision to award Peek permanent\r\n  partial disability.Â  The Appellate Panel\r\n  &quot;must make specific findings of fact upon which a claimant's right to\r\n  compensation are based&quot; in its award. Â Nettles v. Spartanburg Sch.\r\n    Dist. # 7, 341 S.C. 580, 590, 535 S.E.2d 146, 151 (Ct. App. 2000); see\r\n      also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-17-40(A) (Supp. 2010) (providing that an award\r\n  under the Workers' Compensation Act (the Act) requires the order to include\r\n  &quot;a statement of the findings of fact, rulings of\r\n  law, and other matters pertinent to the questions at issue&quot;).Â  &quot;The\r\n  duty to determine facts is placed solely on the [Appellate Panel] and the court\r\n  reviewing the decision of the [Appellate Panel] has no authority to determine\r\n  factual issues . . . .&quot;Â  Fox v. Newberry Cnty. Mem'l Hosp.,&nbsp;319\r\n  S.C. 278, 280, 461 S.E.2d 392, 394&nbsp;(1995).Â  \r\nGenerally,\r\n  an employee will be limited to a scheduled recovery for a back injury.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 42-9-30(21) (Supp. 2010).Â  However, an employee can receive general\r\n  disability benefits if the employee can showÂ  his back injury affects other\r\n  parts of his body.Â  Lee v. Harborside Cafe,&nbsp;350 S.C. 74, 78, 564 S.E.2d 354, 356&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002).Â  Section 42-9-30(21) also permits an award for\r\n  permanent total disability for a back injury when the employee suffers from a\r\n  fifty percent or more loss of the use of the back.Â Â  Additionally, an employee\r\n  must show a loss of earning capacity in order to receive an award under the\r\n  general disability sections.Â  Fields v. Owens Corning Fiberglas,&nbsp;301\r\n  S.C. 554, 555, 393 S.E.2d 172, 173 (1990). Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n Here, the Appellate Panel properly provided specific\r\n  findings of fact concerning its decision to award Peek permanent partial\r\n  disability.Â  See Nettles, 341 S.C. at 587, 535 S.E.2d at 149. Â In\r\n  the single commissioner's order, he found Peek was entitled to permanent\r\n  partial disability because Peek suffered from a loss of earning capacity.Â  In\r\n  support, the single commissioner cited to the testimony of Price, a certified\r\n  rehabilitation counselor, concerning Peek's employment prospects.Â \r\n  Additionally, the single commissioner noted Peek suffered from a scheduled\r\n  injury that affected other parts of his body.Â  The Appellate Panel affirmed the\r\n  single commissioner's finding and noted the scheduled back injury affected\r\n  Peek's legs.Â  \r\n Substantial\r\n  evidence supports the Appellate Panel's decision.Â  Peek presented evidence that\r\n  he suffered from a scheduled injury that affected other parts of his body.Â \r\n  Peek testified that he continued to suffer from back and leg pain. Â Peek's physician,\r\n  Dr. Donald Johnson, also indicated Peek would have to take intermittent muscle\r\n  relaxers and pain medications for his chronic pain.Â  Substantial evidence also exists\r\n  to support the Appellate Panel's finding that Peek suffered from a loss of wage\r\n  earning capacity.Â  Price believed Peek's employment prospects were limited due\r\n  to his lack of transferable occupational skills and physical limitations.Â \r\n  Consequently, Price estimated Peek was capable of only non-skilled or\r\n  semi-skilled work making $8 an hour.Â  \r\n2.&nbsp; We find the circuit court did not\r\n  err in making its own findings of fact concerning whether Peek suffered from\r\n  permanent total disability under section 42-9-30(21).Â  An employee cannot recover\r\n  under both general disability and scheduled member sections.Â  Fields,&nbsp;301\r\n  S.C. at 555, 393 S.E.2d at 173. Furthermore, the reviewing court is not\r\n  concerned with whether the Appellate Panel awarded benefits under the general\r\n  disability section or scheduled member section.Â  Roper v. Kimbrell's of Greenville, Inc.,&nbsp;231 S.C. 453, 455-56, 99 S.E.2d 52,\r\n  53-54&nbsp;(1957). The reviewing court is\r\n  concerned with whether substantial evidence exists to support the Appellate\r\n  Panel's award.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5)(e) (Supp. 2010).Â  Thus, Peek's\r\n  argument that the circuit court improperly made findings of fact concerning\r\n  Peek's permanent total disability claim is without merit. Â The Appellate Panel\r\n  only needs to make specific findings of fact concerning its basis for an award.\r\n  Â See Roper,&nbsp;231 S.C. at 455-56, 99 S.E.2d at 53-54.Â  Consequently, the circuit court's findings of fact\r\n  concerning Peek's permanent total disability claim have no effect on the\r\n  circuit court's ultimate decision to affirm the Appellate Panel's permanent\r\n  partial disability award, which was supported by substantial evidence.\r\n3.&nbsp; We find the circuit court did not\r\n  err in affirming the Appellate Panel's decision to deny Peek a lump sum\r\n  payment. Â The Appellate Panel has discretion to determine whether a lump sum\r\n  award would be appropriate.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-301 (1976)\r\n  (providing the court may award a lump sum payment for workers' compensation\r\n  claims); see also Thompson v. S.C. Steel Erectors, 369 S.C. 606,\r\n  612, 632 S.E.2d 874, 878&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006) (finding this court looks for\r\n  whether the Appellate Panel abused its discretion when making its decision\r\n  concerning lump sum payments).Â  Peek's argument that lump sum payment must be\r\n  awarded if it is in the employee's best interests is unpersuasive because the employee's\r\n  best interest is just one part of the analysis. Â The reviewing court must also\r\n  consider whether the lump sum payment would prevent an undue hardship upon the\r\n  employer without prejudicing the employee's interest.Â  No evidence supports a\r\n  finding that the Appellate Panel's refusal to not award a lump sum payment was\r\n  not in Peek's best interests.Â  Additionally, the Appellate Panel properly\r\n  determined that any lump sum award would be based upon\r\n  surmise, conjecture, or speculation because Peek's future earnings were\r\n  unknown.Â  See Hutson v. State Ports\r\n    Auth., 390 S.C. 108, 113, 700 S.E.2d\r\n  462, 465 (Ct. App. 2010) (holding the award of a lump sum payment &quot;may not be based upon surmise, conjecture, or speculation,\r\n  but must be founded on evidence of sufficient substance to afford a reasonable\r\n  basis for it&quot; (citation and internal\r\n  quotation marks omitted)).Â Â  \r\nAccordingly, the decision of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-399","title":"State v.

Thomas Lavender, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent Haselden\r\n  Turkey Farm.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Back\r\n  Swamp Community Association (Back Swamp) appeals the Administrative Law Court's\r\n  (ALC's) affirmance of the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental\r\n  Control's (DHEC's) issuance of a permit to Haselden Farms.Â  It contends (1) DHEC\r\n  did not properly follow the permitting process and (2) the issuance of the\r\n  permit was not supported by the greater weight of the evidence.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\n1.&nbsp; Bret Caswell, a DHEC official\r\n  responsible for reviewing the Haselden application, testified that all\r\n  procedures were followed with respect to the permitting process.Â  The site was preliminarily\r\n  inspected and approved by the DHEC Groundwater Division.Â  All public notice requirements\r\n  were provided and opponents of the permit were given the opportunity to comment\r\n  either in writing or at a public meeting.Â  The appellate court may not substitute its judgment for the\r\n  judgment of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact\r\n  and will only reverse or modify the decision if the decision is clearly\r\n  erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence in the\r\n  whole record. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5) (Supp. 2010).Â  Therefore, we affirm the ALC's determination that DHEC\r\n  properly conducted the application process.\r\n2.&nbsp; Back Swamp, consisting of\r\n  neighboring landowners, opposed the issuance of the permit.Â  At trial, its\r\n  members testified as to how the operation of the turkey farm would negatively\r\n  impact the environment and their health.Â  They also presented the expert\r\n  testimony of Dr. Barry Ryan, who opined that DHEC should not have issued the\r\n  permit as is, but should have required additional setbacks or other measures to\r\n  further limit the impact of the turkey farm on the surrounding community.Â  \r\nThe record shows after reviewing a medical evaluation\r\n  packet, Dr. Lena Bretous, a medical epidemiologist employed by DHEC, indicated\r\n  the site would be appropriate as proposed.Â  State Epidemiologist, Dr. Jerry Gibson,\r\n  supported Dr. Bretous's evaluation.Â  Steven Smutz, a civil engineer with DHEC\r\n  in the modeling section of the Bureau of Air, reviewed the Haselden application\r\n  and testified the majority of emissions generated from a turkey farm are not\r\n  regulated under state or federal standards.[2]Â \r\n  William McMeekin, a state-licensed engineer and former state employee,\r\n  testified he performed soil borings at the proposed animal burial site on the\r\n  property and augered seven feet deep without finding water or soil discoloration,\r\n  which would indicate the seasonal high of the water table in that area.Â  Dr.\r\n  Ryan testified that if the borings were accurate, the buffer of two feet\r\n  between the bottom of the burial pit and the water table should be sufficient\r\n  to prevent groundwater contamination.Â  \r\nDHEC permit reviewers are to act on permits to\r\n  &quot;prevent, so far as reasonably possible considering relevant standards\r\n  under state and federal laws, an increase in pollution of the waters and air of\r\n  the State from any new or enlarged sources.&quot;Â  24A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. Â§\r\n  61-43.200.70(E) (Supp. 2010).Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we affirm the ALC's order upholding DHEC's issuance of the permit to Haselden\r\n  Farms.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, KONDUROS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. Â \r\n[2] Hydrogen\r\n  sulfide is a potential emission that is regulated, but both Smutz and Dr. Ryan\r\n  testified the likelihood of hydrogen sulfide being produced in a dry facility\r\n  such as the one proposed was very low.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-403","title":"SCDSS v.

Barnette, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Jerry\r\n  Lee Ward appeals his convictions for attempted armed robbery, kidnapping, and\r\n  assault with intent to kill, arguing the circuit court erred in refusing to\r\n  dismiss the indictments because of the State's failure to preserve potentially\r\n  exculpatory evidence.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nAn appellate court only\r\n  reviews errors of law in criminal cases and is bound by the circuit court's\r\n  findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous and unsupported by the\r\n  evidence.Â  State v. Williams, 386 S.C. 503, 509, 690 S.E.2d 62, 65 (2010).Â \r\n  In order to establish a due process violation arising from the State's failure\r\n  to preserve evidence, a defendant must &quot;demonstrate (1) that the State\r\n  destroyed the evidence in bad faith, or (2) that the evidence possessed an\r\n  exculpatory value apparent before the evidence was destroyed and the defendant\r\n  cannot obtain other evidence of comparable value by other means.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. 526, 538-39, 552 S.E.2d 300, 307 (2001); see\r\n      also State v. Jackson, 302 S.C. 313, 315, 396 S.E.2d 101, 102 (1990).\r\nWe hold the circuit court did\r\n  not err in denying Ward's motion to dismiss.Â  First, Ward presents no evidence\r\n  or even an argument that the videotape was destroyed in bad faith.Â  Second, we\r\n  find the videotape did not possess an apparent exculpatory value before it was\r\n  destroyed.Â  Only the investigating officer reviewed the videotape, and he testified\r\n  that static on the videotape prevented him from identifying the people in the\r\n  frame.Â  The review neither convinced him that the videotape would help in the\r\n  identification of the assailant nor made him question the victim's\r\n  allegations.Â  Indeed, the victim testified that the crimes occurred in the convenience\r\n  store's coolerâ€”away from the security cameras' view.Â  Ward's argument that the\r\n  videotape &quot;clearly could have possessed&quot; an exculpatory value before\r\n  it was destroyed does not &quot;satisfy the standard of constitutional\r\n  materiality.&quot;Â  Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51, 56 n.* (1988) (&quot;The\r\n  possibility that the [evidence] could have exculpated [the defendant] if\r\n  preserved or tested is not enough to satisfy the standard of constitutional\r\n  materiality . . . .&quot;).Â  Moreover, Ward had the ability to cross-examine the\r\n  investigating officer about what he saw on the videotape and whether the actions\r\n  of the people on it were consistent with Ward's account of the facts.Â  See California v. Trombetta, 467 U.S. 479, 490 (1984) (suggesting\r\n  cross-examination as a method to mitigate the absence of potentially\r\n  exculpatory evidence by &quot;rais[ing] doubts in the mind of the factfinder&quot;).Â \r\n  We find Ward's due process rights were not violated.Â  Accordingly, the decision\r\n  of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J., THOMAS\r\n  and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-407","title":"State v.

Â We affirm.[1]\r\nThis court reviews the trial\r\n  court's decision to deny attorney's fees requested under section 15-77-300 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (2005) for an abuse of discretion in considering the\r\n  applicable factors.Â  Layman v. State, 376 S.C 434, 444, 658 S.E.2d 320,\r\n  325 (2008).Â  &quot;An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of the\r\n  trial court are either controlled by an error of law or are based on\r\n  unsupported factual conclusions.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nA party prevailing in\r\n  defending an action against the State or its political subdivisions in a civil\r\n  action may recover reasonable attorney's fees if: &quot;(1) the court finds that the agency acted without\r\n  substantial justification in pressing its claim against the party; and (2)\r\n  the court finds that there are no special circumstances that would make the\r\n  award of attorney's fees unjust.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-77-300.Â  &quot;An agency acts with 'substantial justification'\r\n  within the meaning of the statute when its position has a 'reasonable basis in\r\n  law and fact.'&quot;Â  Cornelius v. Oconee Cnty., 369 S.C. 531, 539, 633\r\n  S.E.2d 492, 497 (2006).Â  Substantial justification means &quot;justified in\r\n  substance or in the main â€“ that is, justified to a degree that could satisfy a\r\n  reasonable person.&quot;Â  Heath v. Aiken, 302 S.C. 178, 183, 394 S.E.2d\r\n  709, 712 (1990) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nIn a negligence\r\n  action, it is sufficient that the person charged with negligence &quot;should\r\n  have foreseen his negligence would probably cause injury to [something or]\r\n  someone&quot; and &quot;may be held liable for anything which appears to have\r\n  been a natural and probable consequence of his negligence,&quot; even when he\r\n  did not contemplate the particular event which occurred.Â  Greenville Mem'l\r\n    Auditorium v. Martin, 301 S.C. 242, 245, 391 S.E.2d 546, 547-48 (1990)\r\n  (citations omitted).Â  \r\nHere, the trial court did not\r\n  abuse its discretion in denying Bruns's request for attorney's fees by finding Commission\r\n  had substantial justification in pressing a negligence action against Bruns. Â Bruns,\r\n  a licensed pilot, left the runway surface at Greenville Downtown Airport and\r\n  entered the Engineered Material Arresting System (EMAS) surface, causing damage.Â \r\n  As a pilot, Bruns had a duty at common law and pursuant to FAA regulations to\r\n  operate his aircraft in such a manner as not to damage Commission's property. Â It\r\n  should have been foreseeable to Bruns that he could potentially damage airport\r\n  property if he did not operate his aircraft in a way that would permit him to\r\n  stop at the end of the runway.Â  Although Bruns disputed the airport gave him\r\n  notice of the presence of the EMAS beyond the end of the runway, the airport's\r\n  directory contained a notation of an EMAS.Â  Furthermore, markers and lights\r\n  indicated the end of the runway, and chevrons were painted on top of the EMAS designating\r\n  a surface unusable for taxiing.Â  The Air Traffic Controller testified he thought\r\n  Bruns was going to turn before the end of the runway. Â Thus, facts existed in\r\n  the record to justify Commission to conclude Bruns was negligent and the\r\n  property damage to the EMAS was a natural and probable consequence of Bruns's negligence.Â \r\n  The jury's finding that Bruns was negligent and proximately caused some of\r\n  Commission's loss serves only to confirm Commission's position.Â  Accordingly, facts\r\n  in the record support the trial court's finding Commission had substantial\r\n  justification in bringing and maintaining a negligence action against Bruns.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, PIEPER,\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-411","title":"State v.

Johnson appeals his conviction for\r\n  trafficking cocaine, arguing the trial court erroneously denied his motion to\r\n  suppress the evidence found in his car because the circumstances of stopping\r\n  his car and detaining him mandated suppression, and the &quot;discovery of the\r\n  gun and drugs were part and parcel of the same stop and detention.&quot; Â We affirm.[1]\r\n&quot;In criminal cases, the\r\n  appellate court sits to review errors of law only&quot; and is &quot;bound by\r\n  the trial court's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Butler, 353 S.C. 383, 388, 577 S.E.2d 498, 500 (Ct. App. 2003) (citations\r\n  omitted).Â  The appellate court applies the same standard of review to\r\n  preliminary factual findings in determining the admissibility of evidence in\r\n  criminal cases.Â  Id.Â  &quot;Our review in Fourth amendment search and\r\n  seizure cases is limited to determining whether any evidence supports the trial\r\n  court's finding.&quot;Â  Id. (citation omitted).\r\n&quot;Where probable cause\r\n  exists to believe that a traffic violation has occurred, the decision to stop\r\n  the automobile is reasonable per se.&quot;Â  State v. Williams, 351 S.C.\r\n  591, 598, 571 S.E.2d 703, 707 (Ct. App. 2002) (citing Whren v. United States,\r\n  517 U.S. 806, 809-10 (1996)).Â  Police presence &quot;does not, standing alone,\r\n  constitute a seizure&quot; when a reasonable person would believe he is free to\r\n  &quot;go about his business.&quot;Â  Michigan v. Chesternut, 486 U.S.\r\n  567, 575-76 (1988) (citations omitted).Â  &quot;[A]ny\r\n  object falling within the plain view of a law enforcement officer who is\r\n  lawfully in a position to view the object is subject to lawful seizure.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Abdullah, 357 S.C. 344, 352, 592 S.E.2d 344, 349 (Ct. App. 2004). \r\nThe trial court properly denied Johnson's motion to suppress\r\n  the evidence found in his car.Â  Evidence in the record supports the trial court's\r\n  finding that the stop was lawful and it ended.Â  A police officer stopped\r\n  Johnson in the parking lot of a flower shop for a license plate violation.Â  After\r\n  a stop of at most fifteen minutes, the officer gave Johnson a verbal warning,\r\n  told him he was free to go, and Johnson exited his car and entered the flower\r\n  shop.Â  Johnson's departure from the police's presence and entrance into the\r\n  flower shop is evidence he felt free to leave.Â  Thus, the trial court committed\r\n  no clear error regarding the lawfulness of this stop.\r\nFurther, evidence in the\r\n  record supports the trial court's finding that the discovery of a firearm in\r\n  plain view was a separate incident which led to the finding of the drugs.Â \r\n  After Johnson entered the flower shop, the first officer and a backup officer\r\n  were walking back to their cars.Â  At that time, the backup officer noticed a\r\n  firearm on the floorboard of the driver's side of Johnson's car, through the\r\n  passenger-side window.Â  The officers then arrested Johnson for a firearm\r\n  violationpursuant to section 16-23-20 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (2003).Â  An inventory search of the car led to the discovery\r\n  of drugs in the armrest of the car.Â  Therefore, the trial court's denial of the\r\n  motion to suppress is supported by the evidence. \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, PIEPER,\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-412","title":"State v.

McKenzie's claim for workers' compensation\r\n  benefits for an injury he sustained when he twisted his back while climbing the\r\n  steps to get on a crane (the Incident) at Mittal Steel USA.Â  The Appellate\r\n  Panel found McKenzie's claim was not compensable because the Incident was an\r\n  idiopathic fall caused by a recurrence and continuation of an injury sustained\r\n  at work in 2002 (First Injury).[1]Â Â  On appeal, McKenzie argues the Appellate Panel\r\n  erred in finding: (1) the Incident did not aggravate or exacerbate McKenzie's\r\n  pre-existing conditions; (2) the injury\r\n  was not compensable because it did not arise out of his employment; and (3) the\r\n  Incident constituted an idiopathic fall. Â We affirm.[2]\r\nAn\r\n  employee may receive an award for workers' compensation benefits if the\r\n  employee proves by a preponderance of the evidence that a subsequent injury aggravated\r\n  a preexisting condition.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-35(A) (1) (Supp. 2010). Â &quot;When\r\n  a pre-existing condition or disease is accelerated or aggravated by injury or\r\n  accident 'arising out of and in the course of the employment,' the resulting\r\n  disability is a compensable injury.&quot;Â  Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co.,\r\n  360 S.C. 276, 295, 599 S.E.2d 604, 614&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  However, an\r\n  exception exists prohibiting compensation if the injury is &quot;due solely to the natural progression of a pre-existing\r\n  condition.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;The right of a claimant to\r\n  compensation for aggravation of a pre-existing condition arises only where\r\n  there is a dormant condition which has produced no disability but which becomes\r\n  disabling by reason of the aggravating injury.&quot; Id.Â Â Â  \r\nWe\r\n  hold[3] the Appellate Panel did not err in finding the Incident did not aggravate or\r\n  exacerbate McKenzie's pre-existing conditions. In making its decision, the Appellate Panel found, \r\n\r\n  [McKenzie's] problems on\r\n    February 6, 2008, as well as at the time of the hearing on August 12, 2008,\r\n    were as a result of a continuing failed back and radicular leg symptoms and\r\n    left foot drop, which date back to the original injury in 2002, and were not\r\n    aggravated or made worse by any incident on February 6, 2008, but rather were\r\n    natural progression and recurrence of such problems.\r\n\r\nHere,\r\n  substantial evidence exists in the record\r\n  to support the Appellate Panel's finding that McKenzie's leg and back injuries\r\n  were a result of the natural progression of these problems.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5)(e) (Supp. 2010)\r\n  (providing this court must affirm a decision of the Appellate Panel if it is\r\n  supported by substantial evidence).Â  Specifically,\r\n  the medical evidence established McKenzie's condition was never dormant.Â  Both McKenzie\r\n  and Dr. Triana, an orthopedic doctor, agreed McKenzie never fully recovered\r\n  from his First Injury, continued to have pain and mobility issues in his left\r\n  leg, and would eventually need back surgery. Â Furthermore, McKenzie has taken\r\n  pain medication on a regular basis since 2002 to manage the symptoms associated\r\n  with these injuries.Â  Additionally, the medical evidence indicated that these\r\n  symptoms are a part of the natural progression of his back and leg injuries.Â  Accordingly, we affirm because substantial evidence supports the Appellate Panel's\r\n  factual findings that McKenzie's issues were a natural progression of his back\r\n  and leg injuries. \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHUFF, PIEPER,\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]In 2002, McKenzie sustained back and leg injuries that\r\n  exacerbated his degenerative disc disease while working as a brakeman at the\r\n  Georgetown Steel Mill.Â  As a result, McKenzie and Georgetown Steel Mill signed\r\n  an agreement to settle his workers' compensation claim in which the owners of\r\n  the Steel Mill agreed to provide McKenzie with ongoing medical treatment for\r\n  his leg and back injuries and a settlement fee. \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3] Because the issue of whether McKenzie's back and leg\r\n  issues were a result of the natural progression of his First Injury is\r\n  dispositive, we need not address the remaining two issues.Â  See Futch\r\n    v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d\r\n  591, 598 (1999) (noting an appellate court need not address appellant's\r\n  remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive).Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
