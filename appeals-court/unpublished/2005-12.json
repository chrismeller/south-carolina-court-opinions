Litvin, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Solicitor Robert M. Ariail, and Assistant Solicitor Anderson M. Horne, both of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This is an estreatment case.Â  A-1 Bail Bonding Company appeals the order of the trial court finding defendant Frederick Larue violated the terms of his bond and ordering $30,000 of the bond be estreated to the State.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn October 2, 2003, A-1 Bail Bonding signed an appearance bond in the amount of $50,000 for Defendant Fredrick Larue.Â  The appearance bond required him to appear â€œwhen notified.â€ Â In 2004, Larueâ€™s counsel made a motion to be relieved as counsel, and Larue was ordered to appear before the circuit court.Â  Upon his failure to appear for that hearing in May of 2004, the trial court issued a bench warrant for his arrest.Â  At the first estreatment hearing on October 8, 2004, the trial court gave A-1 ten additional days to secure documentation that Larue was incarcerated in another state.Â  On October 29, 2004, A-1 provided the trial court with information of Larueâ€™s ongoing incarceration at the Joseph Hart Correctional Institute in Oklahoma, but did not produce Larue or secure his release from this institution.Â  Because Larue â€œfail[ed] to appear in the Court of General Sessions when duly summoned or did not comply with the provisions of good behavior as required by the bond,â€ the trial court ordered estreatment of the bond in the amount of $30,000 to be payable within 15 days of the date of the order.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhere the terms of a statute are clear and unambiguous, there is no room for construction, and the court must apply such terms according to their literal meaning.Â  Gentry v. Yonce, 337 S.C. 1, 13, 522 S.E.2d 137, 143 (1999).Â  An appellate court cannot construe a statute without regard to its plain meaning.Â  Brown v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 515, 560 S.E.2d 410, 414 (2002). Â Neither may it resort to a forced interpretation in an attempt to expand or limit the scope of a statute.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nA-1 claims the trial court erred in ordering forfeiture of the bond for the suretyâ€™s failure to secure Larueâ€™s presence at a hearing on the motion to be relieved as counsel.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe overriding purpose of requiring a criminal defendant to post bond before his release from custody is to insure his appearance at trial.Â  State v. Workman, 274 S.C. 341, 343, 263 S.E.2d 865, 866 (1980).Â  As guarantor, the surety on an appearance bond undertakes the risk of forfeiture in the event the defendant does not appear for trial.Â  Pride v. Anders, 266 S.C. 338, 341, 223 S.E.2d 184, 186 (1976).Â  Thus, the possible forfeiture of bond is incentive for sureties to ensure the appearance of the defendant.Â  The issue of whether a bond forfeiture should be remitted, and if so, to what extent, is vested in the discretion of the trial judge.Â  Workman, 274 S.C. at 343, 263 S.E.2d at 866.\r\nSection 38-53-70 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004) provides: \r\n\r\n  If a defendant fails to appear at a court proceeding to which he has been summoned, the court must issue a bench warrant for the defendant.Â  If the surety fails to surrender the defendant or place a hold on the defendantâ€™s release from incarceration . . . within thirty days of the issuance of the bench warrant, the bond shall be forfeited.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  In addition, section 17-15-20 of the South Carolina Code (2003) states that an appearance bond carries certain conditions, including the defendantâ€™s appearance in court and his good behavior.Â  Estreatment for a violation of the good behavior condition is proper.Â  State v. Boatwright, 310 S.C. 281, 283, 423 S.E.2d 139, 140 (1992).Â  \r\nIt is clear the hearing on counselâ€™s motion to be relieved was an integral part of the trial proceedings.Â  Therefore, Larueâ€™s presence at that court proceeding was vital and ordered by the court.Â  Furthermore, he did not notify the court of his whereabouts, as required by the contract.Â  Most importantly, Larue pled guilty to a crime in Oklahoma and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.Â  Therefore, it is beyond dispute that he breached the condition of good behavior.Â Â  \r\nUnquestionably, Larueâ€™s bond was legally forfeited, and the trial court properly entered judgment on the bond.Â  However, A-1 also claims the trial court abused its discretion in estreating the bond in the amount of $30,000.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 38-53-70 of the South Carolina Code requires the trial court to consider the costs to the State â€œresulting from the necessity to continue or terminate the defendantâ€™s trial and the efforts of law enforcement or agencies to locate the defendant.â€Â  The trial court should also consider the purpose of the bond and the nature and willfulness of the default.Â  Boatwright, 310 S.C. at 287, 423 S.E.2d at 142-43.Â  We find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in estreating the bond in the amount of $30,000.Â  The State presented sufficient evidence of substantial costs to the State, and the purpose of the bond was to ensure the defendantâ€™s presence in court proceedings involving him.Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the trial courtâ€™s order is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE, WILLIAMS, JJ., AND CURETON, A.J., CONCUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument, pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-605","title":"Aiken Technical College v.

Brown, all of Columbia, N. Keith Emge and M. Elizabeth Jowers, both of Charleston Robin A. Braithwaite, of Aiken, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Aiken Technical College appeals the trial courtâ€™s order of dismissal in regards to its negligence cause of action against Two State Construction Company, Inc., LS3P Associates, Ltd., Buford Goff &amp; Associates, Inc., The Trane Company, Columbia Sheet Metal, Inc., and Johnson Controls, Inc. for an HVAC systemâ€™s failure that allegedly caused significant damage.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1997, Aiken Technical College entered into an Architect Agreement with LS3P Associates, Ltd. for the design of a new Information Technology Training Center at the college.Â  LS3P then entered into an Owner Consultant Agreement with Buford Goff &amp; Associates, Inc. to perform the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing services on the project.Â  The college also entered into a contract with Two State Construction Company, Inc. for the actual construction of the Center, which included the installation of three HVAC units by Columbia Sheet Metal, Inc.Â  The Trane Company manufactured and sold the HVAC units and their operating computers.Â  Johnson Controls, Inc. installed and maintained the operating computers.Â  \r\nIn December 2000, the HVAC units at the Center failed to operate properly, releasing water into the Center, which caused substantial damage to the Center and its contents.Â  Upon being notified of the incident, Buford Goff, LS3P, Johnson Controls, and Two State Construction joined the college in assessing the damage at the Center.Â  Applied Science and Engineering, on behalf of the college, also examined the building and issued a report outlining the possible causes of the incident.Â  \r\nOn November 26, 2003, the college filed this action against Two State Construction, LS3P, Buford Goff, The Trane Company, Columbia Sheet Metal, Johnson Controls (collectively Respondents), and an unknown party for negligence, breach of contract, breach of implied warranties of merchantability, fitness, and workmanlike manner, and breach of express warranties.Â  The college alleged actual and punitive damages as a result of the HVAC unitâ€™s failure.Â  Respondents filed a joint motion to dismiss the collegeâ€™s claims under Rule 12(b)(6) and Rule 56, SCRCP, on the grounds that the collegeâ€™s complaint failed to set forth facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action because the Consolidated Procurement Code, section 11-35-4230 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2003), is the exclusive means for resolving contract controversies between a state agency, such as the college, and Respondents.Â  Respondents also asserted the collegeâ€™s claims should be dismissed because the Procurement Code provides a one year time limitation.Â  \r\nAt the hearing, the college conceded the Procurement Code was the exclusive means for resolving all the contract causes of action.Â  However, it argued the claims for negligence were not covered by the Procurement Code.Â  The trial court found the contracts between the college and Respondents were governed by the terms of the Procurement Code, providing the exclusive means and exclusive original jurisdiction of all disputes with the chief procurement officer and the Procurement Review Panel.Â  Moreover, the trial court held that â€œnothing in the statute or case law supports [the collegeâ€™s] contentionâ€ that the exclusivity provision of the Procurement Code does not apply to tort actions and granted Respondentsâ€™ motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary judgment.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAs permitted by Rule 56(c) and (e), SCRCP, the trial court treated Respondentsâ€™ Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, motion as a motion for summary judgment because the trial court considered matters outside of the pleadings.\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56(c) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493-94, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  In determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences, which can reasonably be drawn therefrom, must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Faile v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Juvenile Justice, 350 S.C. 315, 324, 566 S.E.2d 536, 539 (2002).Â  If triable issues exist, those issues must go to the fact finder.Â  Young v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corr., 333 S.C. 714, 717, 511 S.E.2d 413, 415 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nSummary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.Â  Vermeer Carolinaâ€™s, Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Corp., 336 S.C. 53, 59, 518 S.E.2d 301, 305 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  All ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed most strongly against the moving party.Â  Bayle v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 120, 542 S.E.2d 736, 738 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them, summary judgment should be denied.Â  See Hall v. Fedor, 349 S.C. 169, 173-74, 561 S.E.2d 654, 656 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Moreover, summary judgment is a drastic remedy, which should be cautiously invoked so no person will be improperly deprived of a trial of the disputed factual issues.Â Â  Lanham v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, 349 S.C. 356, 363, 563 S.E.2d 331, 336 (2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe college claims the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because the South Carolina Consolidated Procurement Code, section 11-35-4230 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2003), is not applicable to the negligence cause of action.Â  We disagree. \r\nSection 11-35-4230(1) provides â€œthe exclusive means of resolving a controversy between the State and a contractor or subcontractor,â€ which arises â€œunder or by virtue of a contract between them including, but not limited to, controversies based upon breach of contract, mistake, misrepresentation, or other cause for contract modification or recision.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  The procedure set forth in the Procurement Code is the exclusive means of resolving a controversy, whether or not the parties voluntarily chose to proceed under the Code.Â  Unisys Corp. v. S.C. Budget &amp; Control Bd., 346 S.C. 158, 170, 551 S.E.2d 263, 270 (2001).Â  According to the statute, a request for resolution of a contract controversy must be filed in writing to the appropriate chief procurement officer within one year of the date the requesting party first knows or should know of a latent defect.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-35-4230(2).Â Â Â Â  \r\n The contract between the college and Two State was for the construction of the Center and included a provision that the Procurement Code would â€œconstitute the exclusive means of resolving controversy between the State and a Contractor or Subcontractor.â€Â  Respondents allege the contract between the college and LS3P contained similar language.Â  However, this contract was not provided to this court in the Record on Appeal, though it is quoted by the trial court in its order granting the dismissal.Â  The terms of the contract between LS3P and Buford Goff stipulated disputes â€œbe resolved in the same manner as that provided for by the agreement between [the college] and [LS3P].â€Â  \r\nThe negligence cause of action for the failure of the HVAC system arose out of the contract between the parties; it was not a separate tort that existed outside of the contract.Â  See Unisys Corp., 346 S.C. at 170, 551 S.E.2d at 270 (finding the Procurement Code procedures applied to the Stateâ€™s claims for fraud in the inducement and punitive damages, even though the cause of action was not enumerated in the statute).Â  Even if the contracts did not provide for disposition of disputes through the Procurement Code, the statute applies.Â  Therefore, the college should have submitted a request for resolution of the controversy to the appropriate chief procurement officer in writing within one year of the date it first knew or should have known of the alleged negligence.Â  Because the college was required to exhaust its administrative remedies as a matter of law, summary judgment was proper.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated above, the trial courtâ€™s decision is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE, WILLIAMS, JJ., AND CURETON, A.J.,Â  CONCUR.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument, pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-606","title":"State v.

Coombs, Jr., Office of the Attorney General, all of Columbia, and Solicitor John Gregory Hembree, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Dale Bruce Jenkins appeals following convictions for trafficking in cocaine and possession with intent to distribute cocaine within a half-mile of a school or park.Â  Specifically, he asserts the trial court erred in finding that his constitutional right not to testify was not violated by the solicitor during closing arguments.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn the evening hours of January 9, 2002, armed with a search warrant for Jenkinsâ€™ home, police waited outside his place of employment.Â  When Jenkins exited the building, officers took him into custody as he approached his vehicle.Â  As Jenkins was being detained, he was advised of his Miranda[1] rights.\r\nThe officers placed Jenkins in their car and drove to his home to execute the search warrant.Â  When they arrived at the residence, the officers discovered three other people inside, including Jenkinsâ€™ mother, an â€œolder gentleman,â€ and a small child.Â  While officers were searching the home, Glen Kufen, a Georgetown County Sheriffâ€™s officer, began speaking with Jenkins.Â  He told Jenkins that â€œdepending on where the narcotics [were] found in the house, everybody could go to jail or just him.â€Â  Kufen further informed him that if the drugs were found in his room, then only he would be held responsible.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nShortly after Jenkins was so advised, he told officer Kufen that they would find powder cocaine behind the door in his room.Â  Kufen entered Jenkinsâ€™ room, moved a pile of clothes, and pulled the carpet back to expose a plastic container housing a brown paper bag.Â  Two plastic bags containing cocaine were found inside the brown paper bag.Â  A SLED chemical analyst testified that one plastic bag contained 16.94 grams of cocaine and the other contained 4.98 grams.[2]Â  \r\nA Georgetown County Grand Jury subsequently indicted Jenkins for trafficking in cocaine and possession with the intent to distribute cocaine within a half-mile radius of a school or park.Â  Jenkinsâ€™ case proceeded to trial in his absence on August 5, 2003.[3]\r\nAt the start of trial, the court held a Jackson v. Denno[4] hearing to determine whether Jenkins voluntarily gave his statement concerning the drugsâ€™ location.Â  Defense counsel argued the policeâ€™s statements that Jenkinsâ€™ mother and friend could go to jail depending on where the drugs were found essentially coerced Jenkins into talking.Â  Counsel posited that because Jenkins did not want his mother to go to jail, he was forced to tell where the drugs were; thus, the statement was not freely and voluntarily given.Â  \r\nFollowing introduction of various testimony on the issue, the trial court found by a preponderance of the evidence that before the statement was made, Jenkins was fully apprised of his right to remain silent.Â  The court further found that the officerâ€™s statement concerning possible arrests was an accurate statement and, accordingly, there was no duress or threat to get Jenkins to talk.\r\nUpon resolution of the Jackson v. Denno issue, the trial continued on the merits.Â  Following presentation of the Stateâ€™s case in chief, the defense rested without putting forward any additional evidence.Â  As such, the trial proceeded to closing statements.Â  At one point during the Stateâ€™s closing argument, in an effort to preempt a defense argument on the issue, the solicitor began to talk about whether Jenkinsâ€™ statement as to the drugsâ€™ location was given voluntarily.Â  To this end, the solicitor made the following comments:\r\n\r\nNow comes the issue about, â€œWell, gee, he did force him or coerce him.Â  He told them unless he cooperated other people in the house would be arrested.â€Â  Well, the Judge is going to give you instructions in regard to possession that drugs can be possessed by more than one person, and what did the police officer tell him?Â  â€œIf the drugs are found in certain areas more than one person might be arrested.â€Â  Well if you walk into the living room and thereâ€™s three adults there and thereâ€™s drugs on the table, youâ€™re only going to arrest one person?\r\nThink if you were to do that.Â  During the course of the trial all the Defendant would have to do is get on the stand and say, â€œIt wasnâ€™t mine.Â  It wasnâ€™t me.â€Â  The other two people arenâ€™t arrested - - -\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nThe solicitorâ€™s comments were cut off by defense counselâ€™s objection and the matter was heard in a bench conference.Â  At the conclusion of the conference, both parties were able to complete their closing arguments and the court charged the jury with the applicable law.Â  When the courtâ€™s charge was complete, the jury retired and defense counselâ€™s motion for a mistrial was addressed.Â  \r\nSpecifically, defense counsel argued that the solicitorâ€™s comments spoke to a personâ€™s ability to get on the stand and declare his or her innocence.Â  He further asserted that the comments were highly prejudicial and a violation of Jenkinsâ€™ Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.Â  This was especially true given the fact that Jenkins was not at trial and the solicitor pointed towards the witness stand when he made the comments.Â  \r\nThe court denied the mistrial because it found the comments were not directed at Jenkinsâ€™ failure to appear or failure to take the stand, but instead involved a hypothetical scenario.Â  The court further noted that its charge to the jury was clear that the attorneysâ€™ arguments were not in themselves evidence to be considered.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Jenkins argues â€œthe trial court erred in finding that appellantâ€™s constitutional rights to not testify and to rely entirely upon the presumption of innocence were not violatedâ€ by the solicitorâ€™s comments.Â  \r\nWhether a solicitorâ€™s closing argument is proper is a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial court and an appellate court will not overturn a trial courtâ€™s decision concerning closing arguments unless there has been an abuse of that discretion.Â  State v. King, 349 S.C. 142, 160, 561 S.E.2d 640, 649 (Ct. App. 2002) (citations omitted).\r\nAn accused has a constitutional right to remain silent, and exercise of that right may not be used against him.Â  See Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610 (1976); State v. Shuler, 353 S.C. 176, 577 S.E.2d 438 (2003).Â  â€œSpecifically, the solicitor must not comment, whether directly or indirectly, on a defendantâ€™s silence, failure to testify, or failure to present a defense.â€Â  McFadden v. State, 342 S.C. 637, 640, 539 S.E.2d 391, 393 (2000).\r\nWhen an alleged violation of this constitutional right has taken place, also referred to as a Doyle violation, the court must apply the harmless error analysis articulated in State v. Pickens, 320 S.C. 528, 466 S.E.2d 364 (1996).Â  To be harmless under this analysis, the record should reflect that the reference to the defendantâ€™s right to silence was a single reference, not repeated or alluded to; that the defendantâ€™s silence was not connected directly to the defendantâ€™s exculpatory story; the defendantâ€™s story was completely implausible; and evidence of the defendantâ€™s guilt was overwhelming.Â  Id. at 531, 466 S.E.2d at 366.\r\nEven assuming the solicitor made improper comments concerning the defendantâ€™s failure to testify, this alone does not automatically require reversal if the defendant is not prejudiced by the comments.Â  Gill v. State, 346 S.C. 209, 221, 552 S.E.2d 26, 33 (2001).Â  Furthermore, the defendant alleging the violation bears the burden of proving that the comments deprived him of a fair trial.Â  Id.  \r\nIn the current case, even if we decide that the statement could be seen as a comment on Jenkinsâ€™ failure to testify, we find it amounts to harmless error. Â When closing arguments were complete, the trial court charged the jury: â€œthe fact that the Defendant did not testify is not a factor to be considered by you in any way in your deliberation and in your consideration of the question of the guilt or innocence of the Defendant.â€Â  We find this charge sufficient to cure any potential errors.Â  See Johnson v. State, 325 S.C. 182, 188, 480 S.E.2d 733, 735-36 (1997) (holding any potential errors in solicitorâ€™s closing arguments were cured by trial courtâ€™s instruction to jury that it could not consider defendantâ€™s failure to testify).\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nSTILWELL, J., KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r\n[2] Other evidence and drug paraphernalia found in Jenkinsâ€™ room included a digital scale, a pager, a cell phone, small plastic sandwich baggies, razor blades, and a Crown Royal bag containing money.\r\n[3] The record on appeal does not indicate why Jenkins was absent.\r\n[4] 378 U.S. 368 (1964).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-608","title":"State v.

BCS Life Ins. Co., 2005 WL 1943536 at *1 (S.C. 2005).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s decision is unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.â€Â  Id.Â  Because an action seeking an injunction is in equity, an appellate court can find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Doe v. South Carolina Med. Malpractice Liability Joint Underwriting Assâ€™n, 347 S.C. 642, 645, 557 S.E.2d 670, 672 (2001).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nRoss Marine argues the trial court erred in refusing to grant injunctive relief because the Law Firm has a conflict of interest arising from its prior representation of the appellants.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œGenerally, to obtain an injunction, a party must demonstrate irreparable harm, a likelihood of success on the merits, and an inadequate remedy at law.â€Â  Mailsource, LLC v. M.A. Bailey &amp; Associates, Inc., 356 S.C. 363, 367-68, 588 S.E.2d 635, 638 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The trial courtâ€™s decision to deny the requested relief was largely based on the conclusion Ross Marine would not be successful on the merits of its conflict claims.Â  Pursuant to our standard of review, our decision hinges on whether this conclusion is supported by the evidence. \r\nCentral to our analysis of whether the denial of injunctive relief was proper is the law of attorney conflicts regarding former clients.Â  Rule 1.9(a) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, provides:\r\n\r\nA lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter represent another person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that personâ€™s interest are [sic] materially adverse to the interests of the former client unless the former client consents after consultation. (emphasis added)\r\n\r\nâ€œIn determining whether the matter is â€˜substantially related,â€™ one should consider, among other things, whether the affected lawyer â€˜would have or reasonably could have learned confidential information in the first representation that would be of significance in the second.â€™â€Â  Townsend v. Townsend, 323 S.C. 309, 317, 474 S.E.2d 424, 429 (1996) (quoting 1 Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr. &amp; W. William Hodes, The Law of Lawyering: A Handbook on the Model Rules of Professional Conduct Â§ 1.9:104, at 293 (1996)) (emphasis added).\r\nBrowderâ€™s current case against Ross Marine mainly involves issues of compensation, particularly bonuses and employment benefits he alleges are due him pursuant to his employment contract.Â  His pleadings do, however, allege wrongful termination of his employment contract, which, according to Browderâ€™s pleadings, limits termination to disloyal, dishonest, or unlawful conduct.Â  The cases in which Query represented Ross Marine were mainly collection matters, but include a dispute over completed work and a defective product case against a coatings manufacturer.\r\nRoss Marineâ€™s primary support of its conflict claims are the affidavits of Arthur Swygert, Jr., one of which states, in rather conclusory fashion, â€œI believe that Grady Query and Saul Gliserman . . . learned valuable information regarding both David Browderâ€™s employment and the operations of Ross Marine that cause conflicts with their representation of David Browder against Ross Marine.â€Â  In a second affidavit, Swygert expounds on his previous allegation by describing three cases where the Law Firm represented Ross Marine.Â  Swygert asserts that these cases at least tangentially involved Browderâ€™s work performance.\r\nNone of the affidavits, however, aver that any confidential information was obtained by the Law Firm from any of the individual defendants or the corporation.Â  On the contrary, Ross Marine acknowledges that Browder was the primary contact between the company and its attorneys and does not allege how any information could have reasonably been gained in the prior representation that Browder could not simply convey to his attorney in his capacity as a current client.Â  Accordingly, the trial court found Ross Marine failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits of their conflict claim.\r\nAfter reviewing the record on appeal, we conclude the evidence supports this finding.Â  As stated in Madison v. Graffix Fabrix, Inc., 304 S.C. 321, 325-26, 404 S.E.2d 37, 40 (Ct. App. 1991):\r\n\r\n[A]n attorney is not prevented from representing a subsequent client against a former client, where the duties required of him do not conflict with those required in the first employment.Â  The test of whether the attorneyâ€™s employment is inconsistent with his duty to a former client is whether acceptance of the new retainer will require him, in forwarding the interest of the new client, to do anything that will injuriously affect a former client in any matter in which he formerly represented him, and also whether the attorney will be called on, in his new relation, to use against a former client any knowledge or information acquired in the former relationship.\r\n\r\nOne year after the filing of Browderâ€™s complaint, Ross Marine failed to support its blanket allegations of attorney conflict with competent evidence showing confidential information regarding Browderâ€™s claims reasonably could have passed to the Law Firm during the previous representations.Â  Furthermore, Ross Marine failed to cogently articulate how any information in the prior representations is confidential or, for that matter, how it would be of significance in the present action.Â Â Â  Although the standard for determining conflicts against an attorneyâ€™s former clients requires only a minimal showing that the attorney â€œreasonably could haveâ€ learned confidential information, mere conclusory allegations that such information passed to the attorney, with nothing more, do not satisfy an attorney conflict claim. \r\nBecause Ross Marine failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits of their conflict claims, the trial courtâ€™s decision denying injunctive relief is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, KITTREDGE, and Â Â  WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-614","title":"Bush v.

Pascoe, Jr., of Summerville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Heather R. Herring pled guilty to resisting arrest. Â She was sentenced to one year imprisonment, suspended upon the service of two years probation. Â On appeal, Herring argues the court should vacate her guilty plea because the Stateâ€™s evidence does not provide a sufficient factual basis for her plea. Â We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn May 27, 2004, Dorchester County police officers approached 129 Russell Street in Dorchester County with a bench warrant for Heather Herringâ€™s arrest. Â The officers had been informed that Herring was inside the Russell Street residence. Â After the officers entered the trailer, they called out loudly for Herring. Â Although Herring was inside, she did not answer the officersâ€™ calls.Â  Instead, she was hiding from the officers in the shower. Â The officers searched the residence and found Herring, fully clothed, in the master bathroom shower.\r\nHerring pled guilty to resisting arrest. Â The Solicitor recommended two years probation. Â The Circuit Judge sentenced Herring to one year, suspended upon the service of two years probation.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nHerring contends â€œ[t]he Stateâ€™s evidence does not provide a sufficient factual basis for Herringâ€™s guilty plea to a violation of S.C. Code Section 16-9-320(A).â€Â  Herringâ€™s assertion is meritless.\r\nThe usual colloquy occurred between the judge, Herring and defense counsel regarding whether Herring was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily pleading guilty to the charges. Â The judge advised Herring as to her constitutional rights and waiver thereof, inquired into the circumstances of her guilty plea, fully explained the charges and sentencing consequences, and properly determined the plea was knowingly and voluntarily made.Â  Moreover, there was no objection during the guilty plea proceeding. Â Thus, Herring is barred from challenging her guilty plea on direct appeal.Â  See In the Interest of Antonio H., 324 S.C. 120, 477 S.E.2d 713 (1996) (proper avenue in which to challenge guilty plea which is not objected to at time of its entry is through post-conviction relief); State v. Williams, 303 S.C. 410, 401 S.E.2d 168 (1991) (defendant must object at first opportunity to preserve issue for appellate review; alleged error must be raised to and ruled on by trial judge); State v. McKinney, 278 S.C. 107, 292 S.E.2d 598 (1982) (absent timely objection at plea proceeding, unknowing and involuntary nature of guilty plea can be attacked only through more appropriate channel of post-conviction relief).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, Herringâ€™s conviction and sentence are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-617","title":"The Gatherings Horizontal Property Regime v.

Bullard and Sonja Friedman, both of Hilton Head Island, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Bobby S. Williams appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order remanding this collection action to the magistrate for a new hearing because the transcription tape of the original hearing before the magistrate was destroyed.Â  We reverse and remand. \r\nFACTS\r\nThe Gatherings Horizontal Property Regime filed this action against Williams in magistrateâ€™s court for past-due regime fees allegedly owed by the previous owner of Williamsâ€™ condominium, Audress Hill.Â  A concurrently pending action against Hill was dismissed with prejudice when Hill paid the fees.Â  The magistrate concluded any further attempt by The Gatherings to collect from Williams was barred by res judicata. Â By order dated April 7, 2004, the magistrate accordingly dismissed The Gatheringsâ€™ action against Williams and awarded Williams an attorneyâ€™s fee of $3,000.Â  The magistrate denied The Gatheringsâ€™ motion for reconsideration.Â  The Gatherings appealed the magistrateâ€™s order to circuit court and served the magistrate.Â  \r\nThe Gatherings alleges it made numerous telephone calls to the magistrateâ€™s office requesting the trial tape be retained.Â  When the tape was not made available, The Gatherings requested a hearing in circuit court.Â  The circuit court issued an order requiring the magistrate to certify the original record to the circuit court and to allow transcription of the tape.Â  \r\nWhen the magistrate failed to comply with the transcription portion of the order, the circuit court issued an order requiring the magistrate to appear to show cause why he should not be held in contempt.Â  Prior to a hearing on the matter, the magistrate informed the circuit court that the hearing tape had been reused and was unavailable for transcription.Â  The magistrate asserts he reused the tape because he believed the time for filing a notice of appeal had expired. Â The circuit court held a hearing on the issue of the magistrateâ€™s contempt and sua sponte issued an order:Â  â€œBecause the tape . . . is no longer available, the Plaintiff is unable to complete the record on appeal, and therefore this case is remanded to the Magistrateâ€™s court for a new trial.â€Â  Williams appeals.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSection 22-3-10 of the South Carolina Code gives concurrent jurisdiction to the circuit courts and to magistrates in contract actions.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 22-3-10(1) (Supp. 2004).Â  Our code also provides that the circuit courts have appellate jurisdiction over cases initially heard by a magistrate.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 14-5-340 (1977) &amp; 18-7-170 (1985).Â  The circuit court, sitting in an appellate capacity, may reverse a judgment for errors of fact.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 18-7-140 &amp; -170 (1985); Vacation Time of Hilton Head Island, Inc. v. Kiwi Corp., 280 S.C. 232, 234, 312 S.E.2d 20, 21&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1984).Â  Our scope of review, however, is more limited:Â  \r\n\r\n  [T]he Court of Appeals will presume that an affirmance by a Circuit Court of a magistrateâ€™s judgment was made upon the merits where the testimony is sufficient to sustain the judgment of the magistrate and there are no facts that show the affirmance was influenced by an error of law . . . .\r\n\r\nBurns v. Wannamaker, 281 S.C. 352, 357, 315 S.E.2d 179, 182&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1984), affâ€™d as modified on other grounds, 288 S.C. 398, 343 S.E.2d 27 (1985).Â  This court may reverse the circuit court if it was influenced by an error of law.Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWilliams argues the circuit court erred by remanding the case for a new trial rather than requesting an amended return from the magistrate.Â  We agree.Â  Section 18-7-60 of the South Carolina Code applies to appeals from magistrateâ€™s court and directs the magistrate, â€œafter ten days and within thirty days after service of the notice of appeal, [to] make a return to the appellate court of the testimony, proceedings and judgment and file it in the appellate court.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-60 (1985).Â  \r\nSection 18-7-80 supplies the remedy when the magistrateâ€™s return is inadequate by providing:Â  â€œIf the return be defective the appellate court may direct a further or amended return as often as may be necessary and may compel a compliance with its order.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-80 (1985).Â  Whether to direct a further amended return is discretionary with the circuit court.Â  Lynch v. Heyward, 56 S.C. 562, 565, 35 S.E. 220, 221 (1900). \r\nWe find guidance from Chapman v. Computers, Parts &amp; Repairs, 334 S.C. 387, 513 S.E.2d 120 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  In Chapman, the circuit court sua sponte reversed and remanded the action for a new trial based on the magistrateâ€™s inadequate return.Â  Id. at 389, 513 S.E.2d at 121.Â  This court reversed and remanded finding the circuit court violated the terms of section 18-7-80.Â  Id. at 391-92, 513 S.E.2d at 122-23.Â  This court found the remand for a new trial effectively punished the party who prevailed in magistrateâ€™s court, and that the circuit court should have sought an amended return instead of remanding the matter for a new trial.Â  Id. at 391, 513 S.E.2d at 122.\r\nIn criminal proceedings before a magistrate, the legislature has provided a right to a tape or transcription of testimony.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 22-3-790 (1989) (requiring testimony of witnesses in criminal action before a magistrate to be â€œtaken down in writing and signed by the witnessesâ€ unless waived).Â  However, there is no corresponding requirement in civil proceedings.Â  \r\nWe are, however, mindful of our supreme courtâ€™s opinion in McKinley Music v. Glymph.Â  100 S.C. 200, 84 S.E. 715 (1915).Â  In Glymph, the supreme court addressed the issue of the magistrateâ€™s failure to â€œtake downâ€ testimony.Â  The circuit court in Glymph ordered a new trial because the defendantâ€™s testimony was not â€œfully taken down.â€Â  Id. at 202, 84 S.E. at 716.Â  The supreme court affirmed, finding â€œ[a]n amended or further return by the magistrate would not have been effective to supply testimony which had not been â€˜taken down.â€™â€Â  Id. \r\nThe facts in this case are distinguishable from those in Glymph.Â  In Glymph, the court apparently needed a more detailed report of the proceeding prior to reviewing the case.Â  Here, it appears the material facts are undisputed and the case is primarily based on issues of law, not fact.Â  The applicable contracts and documents are included in the record.Â  The magistrateâ€™s order is unambiguous and provides a comprehensive recitation of the proceeding.Â  In such a case, a transcription of the partiesâ€™ testimony appears less likely to be necessary to resolve the issues.Â  However, we leave it to the circuit courtâ€™s discretion as to whether an amended return is required.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAfter a review of relevant law, we find the circuit court erred in this case by reversing and remanding for a new trial on the ground stated.Â  We accordingly reverse and remand to the circuit court to receive an amended return from the magistrate, if necessary, and decide the appeal on its merits.[1]\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.Â  \r\nSTILWELL, KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]  Based on our disposition, we decline to address Williamsâ€™ remaining issue on appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-618","title":"State v.

Hughston, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 2005-UP-621\r\nHeard November 7, 2005 â€“ Filed December 9, 2005Â Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Michael W. Sautter and O. Grady Query, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Ralph E. Hoisington, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Paul Mazzell was convicted in 1983 of murder, criminal conspiracy, and kidnapping.Â  He appeals the circuit courtâ€™s denial of his 1997 motion for a new trial based upon after-discovered evidence.Â  We affirm.\r\n FACTS\r\nRicky Seagraves was abducted and murdered near Charleston in 1978. The police did not recover his body until 1981, when investigators received information from Danny Hogg.Â  Hogg admitted he participated in Seagravesâ€™ abduction, but he also implicated Mazzell and Edward Merriman in the crime.Â  In exchange for immunity from prosecution for his role in the abduction and other crimes, Hogg agreed to testify against Mazzell and Merriman.Â  Additionally, Hogg led investigators to the site where Seagravesâ€™ body was buried.\r\nThe State sought the death penalty against Mazzell, who Hogg identified as the triggerman in the murder.Â  Mazzell was tried along with his co-defendant Merriman.Â  The State maintained that Seagraves, Hogg, and Merriman all worked for Mazzell.Â  Allegedly, they were all connected to the Charleston drug trade.Â  The State presented evidence that Mazzell wanted Seagraves killed; therefore, he instructed Hogg and Merriman to abduct and deliver Seagraves to him, and then he killed Seagraves.\r\nHogg testified that Mazzell put a contract on Seagravesâ€™ life.Â  According to Hogg, Mazzell announced, â€œGo get Ricky. Bring him to me. Iâ€™m going to kill him.â€ Hogg and Merriman located Seagraves at a convenience store near Charleston.Â  Hogg testified he heard a gunshot and saw Merriman chase Seagraves into the convenience store.Â  Seagraves was then beaten, dragged back to the truck, and delivered to Mazzell.Â  Mazzell allegedly killed Seagraves and buried his body.Â  Two witnesses corroborated Hoggâ€™s version of the incident.Â  Carl Hines testified that Mazzell declared in late 1978 that he intended to kill Seagraves, and Mazzell later boasted that he had killed him.Â  Harold Behrens also testified that Merriman recounted the abduction and murder to him, giving a description that was consistent with Hoggâ€™s testimony.\r\nIn defense, Mazzell brought out Hinesâ€™ and Behrensâ€™ past criminal activity and noted that numerous prosecution witnesses received special treatment from the State in exchange for their testimony.Â  Mazzellâ€™s attorney particularly assailed Hoggâ€™s credibility by presenting witnesses who testified that Hogg and Mazzell had a falling out.Â  They also testified that Hogg said he would get back at Mazzell by killing him or putting him in jail.Â  Two defense witnesses specifically claimed Hogg admitted he shot and killed Seagraves.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Mazzellâ€™s wife testified that Hogg was at their home on the night of Seagravesâ€™ abduction and that he stated he intended to find Seagraves.Â  She also provided alibi testimony for Mazzell, stating that she and Mazzell went to bed early that night, after watching television at home.Â  Mazzell did not take the stand to offer testimony in his defense.Â  \r\nIn February 1983, a jury convicted Mazzell of murder, criminal conspiracy, and kidnapping.Â  The jury recommended life in prison instead of the death penalty as requested by the State.[1]\r\nMazzell filed a direct appeal, along with his co-defendant Merriman, in which he raised numerous improprieties and misconduct by the State and the prosecutor.Â  Additionally, he argued for a new trial because the court refused to allow into evidence the fact Hogg had to take a polygraph test as part of his immunity agreement.Â  \r\nThis court found some of the allegations of police threats and intimidation to be without evidence, and found the deliberate release of misinformation to the media to be â€œhorrendous and ridiculous,â€ but found it did not affect the trial in a prejudicial manner.Â  State v. Merriman, 287 S.C. 74, 79-80, 337 S.E.2d 218, 222 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  This court also found the trial courtâ€™s curative instruction, after the prosecutors had elicited improper testimony, was sufficient to remedy any harm it caused.Â  Id. at 83, 337 S.E.2d at 224.Â  Finally, the court found the refusal to admit the entire immunity agreement, especially the portion regarding the polygraph testing, was proper given the general inadmissibility of the polygraph test and the fact that it would be cumulative to other evidence in the record.Â  Id. at 87-88, 337 S.E.2d at 226-27.Â  Thereafter, the South Carolina Supreme Court denied Mazzellâ€™s petition for writ of certiorari.Â  \r\nIn 1988, Mazzell filed an application for post-conviction relief (PCR).Â  In his application, he claimed, among other things, that Merriman testified at his own PCR action that Hogg committed the murder and not Mazzell.Â  He maintained this testimony was unavailable at the original trial because Merriman asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.Â  The court denied PCR relief and Mazzellâ€™s separate petition for a writ of certiorari was also denied.\r\nMazzell then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus with the United States District Court for South Carolina in 1990.Â  The petition was granted by the District Court in 1995 on the grounds that Mazzellâ€™s attorney failed to object to erroneous jury instructions.Â  The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decision.Â  Mazzell v. Evatt, 88 F.3d 263 (4th Cir. 1996).Â  On remand to the district court, Mazzelâ€™s petition for writ of habeas corpus was denied.\r\nIn January 1997, Mazzell filed the underlying motion for a new trial.Â  In November 2000, Mazzell filed to have access to the prosecutionâ€™s file for inspection of its documents and noted the disappearance of SLEDâ€™s investigative file.Â  At the hearing on his new trial motion, Mazzell asserted that several possible witness interviews brought to light new evidence that exonerated him.Â  Additionally, he maintained the court should consider polygraph evidence regarding himself, Merriman, and Hogg.Â  He also argued that several items contained in the prosecutionâ€™s file were new evidence because he alleged they were not turned over to defense counsel.Â  Finally, Mazzell maintained prosecutorial misconduct, combined with the evidence brought forth at the hearing, justified a new trial. Â The parties each submitted a post-hearing memorandum.Â  Mazzell also filed a Motion for Alternative Consideration of Evidence as Warranting Issuance of the Writ of Habeas Corpus.\r\nThe trial judge requested an order from the Attorney Generalâ€™s office.Â  Mazzellâ€™s counsel filed objections to the proposed order; therefore, the judge entered his own order in which he detailed the procedural and factual history of the case.Â  The order then stated:\r\n\r\n  In Hayden v. State, the South Carolina Supreme Court reviewed the criteria necessary to grant a new trial on newly discovered evidence.Â  The Court explained:Â  â€œ[a] party requesting a new trial based on after-discovered evidence must show that the evidence:Â  (1) is such as would probably change the result if a new trial was had; (2) has been discovered since the trial; (3) could not by the exercise of due diligence have been discovered before the trial; (4) is material to the issue of guilt or innocence; and, (5) is not merely cumulative or impeaching.â€Â  [Hayden v. State, 299 S.E.2d 854 (S.C. 1983) (citing State v. Caskey, 256 S.E.2d 737 (S.C. 1979)).]Â  The applicant failed to satisfy any of the above criteria and his Motion is Denied.\r\n\r\nThis appeal followed.\r\n\r\n STANDARD OF REVIEW \r\nâ€œThe denial of a motion for a new trial will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  State v. South, 310 S.C. 504, 507, 427 S.E.2d 666, 668 (1993).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when a trial courtâ€™s decision is unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.â€Â  State v. Hughes, 346 S.C. 339, 342, 552 S.E.2d 35, 36 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\n LAW/ANALYSIS \r\n I.Â Â Trial Courtâ€™s Order  \r\n\r\n        Mazzell contends this court should remand the case to the trial court because the trial judge failed to provide sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law in the order denying Mazzellâ€™s motion for a new trial.Â  We disagree.\r\n        The trial judgeâ€™s order, while brief, was complete.Â  It provided a statement of the grounds the judge considered, as well as the standard under which he considered the alleged new evidence.Â  The judge then specifically found:Â  â€œThe applicant failed to satisfy any of the above criteria and his motion is denied.â€ Â Therefore, we find the order did not fail to provide sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law because the trial judgeâ€™s decision can be adequately reviewed by this court for a determination of whether he abused his discretion in denying Mazzell a new trial based on after-discovered evidence.\r\n        II.Â Â After-Discovered Evidence\r\n        Mazzell asserts he is entitled to a new trial because of the after-discovered evidence he put forth at the new trial hearing.Â  \r\n        Pursuant to Rule 29(b), SCRCrimP: \r\n        \r\n          A motion for a new trial based on after-discovered evidence must be made within a reasonable period of time after the discovery of the evidence; provided, however, that a motion for a new trial based on after-discovered evidence may not be made while the case is on appeal unless the appellate court, upon motion, has suspended the appeal and granted leave to make the motion.Â Â  \r\n        \r\n        To obtain a new trial based on after-discovered evidence, the party must show that the evidence:Â  1) would probably change the result if a new trial were granted; 2) has been discovered since trial; 3) could not have in the exercise of due diligence been discovered before trial; 4) is material to the issue of guilt or innocence; and 5) is not merely cumulative or impeaching.Â  State v. Spann, 334 S.C. 618, 619-20, 513 S.E.2d 98, 99 (1999).\r\n        A.Â Â Merriman testimony and polygraph\r\n        Mazzell asserts the testimony provided by Merriman at Merrimanâ€™s PCR hearing constitutes after-discovered evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\n        Evidence presented, which was known to the defendant at the time of his trial, cannot be considered â€œnew evidenceâ€ for purposes of receiving a new trial.Â  See Hayden v. State, 278 S.C. 610, 612, 299 S.E.2d 854, 855-56 (1983).Â  Additionally, because an individual refuses to testify at trial does not make his later testimony new evidence.Â  See, e.g., United States v. Dale, 991 F.2d 819, 839 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (finding majority of circuits considering the issue have found testimony is not new evidence because the declarant refused to testify at trial).\r\n         At Mazzellâ€™s PCR hearing, Merriman testified that Hogg killed Seagraves.Â  He also stated Mazzell never ordered them to find Seagraves or to bring Seagraves to him. Â He explained that Seagraves was dead before they delivered him to Mazzell, though he admitted he did not know for certain that he was dead.Â  The PCR court found his testimony lacked credibility and denied Mazzellâ€™s request for PCR relief based on the alleged after-discovered evidence.\r\n        Merriman died prior to the new trial motion hearing and several former investigators testified regarding conversations with Merriman.Â  SLED Agent Lovat Faircloth testified that in 1987 Merriman indicated Hogg killed Seagraves.Â  Faircloth stated Merriman told him Mazzell was only involved in the disposal of the body.\r\n        Evidence was presented that in 1993 Merriman told SLED Agent Ron Cook that â€œhe is almost positive that Ricky Seagraves was dead by the time they arrived at the houseâ€ and that he never saw Mazzell at the house or knew what happened after he left.Â  Cook reported that Merriman stated Hogg killed Seagraves and Merriman was with him when Hogg shot Seagraves.\r\n        Additionally, in 1993, Merriman took a polygraph test to verify that he witnessed Hogg shoot Seagraves and that he did not witness Mazzell shoot Seagraves.Â  The polygraph report indicates no deception on Merrimanâ€™s part.\r\n        First, this evidence is not new evidence because Mazzell knew it at the time of trial.Â  Additionally, it is not likely to change the result.Â  Merriman testified he did not know for certain that Seagraves was dead.Â  He also told investigators he did not know what happened after he left the house or where they took Seagraves.Â  Hogg testified at trial that Merriman was not present when Mazzell shot Seagraves.Â  Although Merrimanâ€™s testimony that he did not know what happened to Seagraves is confirmed by a polygraph, it is not likely to change the result of the trial.Â  Accordingly, we find Merrimanâ€™s testimony and polygraph are insufficient to support a claim for a new trial based upon after-discovered evidence.\r\n        B.Â Thaddeus Mazzell testimony\r\n        Mazzell contends the testimony of his brother, Thaddeus Mazzell, is new evidence warranting a new trial because the testimony exonerates him for the murder of Seagraves.Â  We disagree.\r\n        Thaddeus refused to testify at Mazzellâ€™s new trial hearing unless he was given immunity.Â  As a result, Mazzell introduced testimony by his attorneys relating to information given to them by Thaddeus.Â  Additionally, Officer Melvin Ballew testified about his interviews of Thaddeus on two separate occasions.\r\n        Ballew testified he interviewed Thaddeus in 1993 and 1996.Â  In 1993, Ballew testified Thaddeus told him that â€œhe was present when Danny Hogg was at [Mazzellâ€™s] house earlier that evening; that he wanted to go get - - wanted to try to find Ricky and that Paul told him to leave Ricky alone.â€Â  According to Ballew, Thaddeus said he and Mazzell were both present when Hogg and Merriman delivered the body to the house.Â  Thaddeus told Ballew that Seagraves was â€œdead as a hammer.â€ \r\n        Ballew testified that at the second interview in 1996, Thaddeus relayed a similar story regarding the events on the night of Seagravesâ€™ murder.Â  Additionally, Ballew stated that Thaddeus told him Hogg and Seagraves had â€œan ongoing feudâ€ and that was why Hogg wanted to get Seagraves.\r\n        Mazzellâ€™s attorney, Keir Weyble, also testified about an interview he had with Thaddeus in 2001.Â  He described similar statements by Thaddeus regarding the events of the night of the murder.Â  He stated Thaddeus told him that he received a call from Mazzell to pick up Mazzell because Hogg â€œgot Ricky [Seagraves].â€ Â According to Weyble, Thaddeus explained that as he and Mazzell were walking up the driveway, Hogg and Merriman arrived with â€œwhat they later found out was the dead body of Ricky Seagraves.â€Â  Weyble testified: â€œThaddeusâ€™ description of Mr. Seagraves at that time was that he was, and I remember this quote because it struck me, â€˜dead as a hammer when he hit the ground.â€™â€Â  Finally, he relayed Thaddeusâ€™ statement that he and Mazzell disposed of the body. \r\n        First, the evidence must have been discovered since the trial and could not have, in the exercise of due diligence, been discovered before trial.Â  Spann, 334 S.C. at 619, 513 S.E.2d at 99.Â  This evidence fails both requirements because the testimony clearly indicates Mazzell should have had knowledge of the testimony as Thaddeus testified he and Mazzell were both present when Seagraves was â€œdelivered.â€Â  Additionally, Mazzell claimed in his â€œApplication for Federal Habeasâ€ relief that one of the claims in his PCR application was â€œ[t]he applicantâ€™s trial counsel unreasonably failed to call Thaddeus Mazzell as a defense witness, despite the fact that Thaddeus Mazzell was available and his testimony would have exculpated the applicant.â€[2] \r\n        It is unlikely that this testimony would have changed the result of the trial.Â  Both Ballew and Weyble indicated that Thaddeus never ensured Seagraves was dead when Hogg delivered his body.Â  The testimony presented at trial indicated Seagraves was hurt when Hogg and Merriman abducted him from the convenience store.Â  Nothing in Thaddeusâ€™ testimony indicates that Seagraves was not merely unconscious when he was removed from the truck.Â  \r\n        Finally, the testimony of Thaddeus lacks sufficient credibility to determine that it would have changed the outcome of the trial.Â  See Hayden, 278 S.C. at 612, 299 S.E.2d at 855-56 (finding the credibility of a witness is a factor in determining whether testimony will likely change the result at the new trial).Â  Thaddeus is Mazzellâ€™s brother and was admittedly involved in the disposal of the body.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a new trial based on the proposed testimony of Thaddeus Mazzell.\r\n        C.Â Pre-trial Statements by Lisa Hogg and William Poindexter\r\n        Mazzell contends the Stateâ€™s suppression of pre-trial statements by Lisa Hogg and William Poindexter requires a new trial.Â  He also contends this evidence constitutes newly discovered evidence because it was not turned over by the State before trial.Â  We disagree.\r\n        We must first discuss the implications of Mazzellâ€™s claims under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and Rule 5, SCRCrimP.Â  â€œA Brady claim is based upon the requirement of due process.Â  Such a claim is complete if the accused can demonstrate (1) the evidence was favorable to the accused, (2) it was in the possession of or known to the prosecution, (3) it was suppressed by the prosecution, and (4) it was material to guilt or punishment.â€Â  Gibson v. State, 334 S.C. 515, 524, 514 S.E.2d 320, 324 (1999).Â  Rule 5 requires:Â  \r\n        \r\n          Upon request of the defendant the prosecution shall permit the defendant to inspect and copy books, papers, documents, . . . , or copies or portions thereof, which are within the possession, custody or control of the prosecution, and which are material to the preparation of his defense or are intended for use by the prosecution as evidence in chief at the trial, or were obtained from or belong to the defendant.\r\n        \r\n        Rule 5(a)(1)(C), SCRCrimP.Â  \r\n        At Mazzellâ€™s PCR hearing, the prosecutor testified he received a motion for disclosure of the prosecutionâ€™s documents from Mazzellâ€™s counsel and he made the Stateâ€™s file available to him.Â  Mazzell has not presented any evidence to refute this assertion by the prosecutor, nor was this statement challenged after the PCR hearing.Â  The only evidence in the record indicates the State complied with the requirement to turn over the evidence to the defense.Â  Moreover, at trial, Mazzellâ€™s counselâ€™s cross-examination of Hogg supports a strong inference that Mazzell was aware of this information.Â  \r\n        Next, we must determine if either document meets the requirements of State v. Spann, 334 S.C. 618, 619-20, 513 S.E.2d 98, 99 (1999), as after-discovered evidence sufficient to warrant a new trial.Â  The first document is the prosecutionâ€™s interview sheet with Lisa Hogg.Â  In the interview as recorded on the sheet under the category â€œPROBLEMS,â€ Lisa indicated Hogg did the killing and â€œsaid it was all a big accident.â€Â  Additionally, the notes on the interview sheet read:Â  â€œThat Ricky started shooting.Â  Hid body at ballpark.Â  That Ricky fired first.â€Â  Under the column â€œSTRATEGYâ€ the sheet reads â€œDonâ€™t C,â€ which is struck through three times.\r\n        The second document is a written statement given by William Poindexter.Â  In his statement, Poindexter asserts that only Hogg came to visit Harry Chestnut at work to discuss something out of his earshot.Â  He testified it was the only time he saw Hogg and Chestnut together while Chestnut was working for him.Â  Poindexterâ€™s statement contradicts testimony given at trial by Chestnut and Hogg that Hogg, Merriman, and Mazzell all met with Chestnut at the job site and discussed the whereabouts of Seagraves.\r\n        As discussed above, according to the prosecutor, both documents were made available to Mazzell prior to trial.Â  As such, they cannot be considered after-discovered evidence.Â  Additionally, Mazzellâ€™s counsel cross-examined Hogg regarding whether he told Lisa that he killed and buried Seagraves.Â  He was also cross-examined about any conversations he had with Lisa about Seagraves firing shots at Hogg first.Â  It appears the information contained in the Lisaâ€™s interview sheet and Poindexterâ€™s written statement was clearly available to the defense at the time of the trial.Â  Accordingly, we find the evidence is not after-discovered evidence as required by Spann.\r\n        D.Â  Polygraph Results of Mazzell, Merriman, and Hogg\r\n        Mazzell contends the polygraph results of Mazzell, Merriman, and Hogg constitute new evidence and should, in conjunction with the testimonial evidence, be sufficient to grant him a new trial.Â  We disagree.\r\n        Even if a new trial is granted, the newly discovered evidence must be admissible in the new trial.Â  Our supreme court has often held the results of polygraph examinations are generally not admissible because the reliability of the tests is questionable.Â  See State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 23-24, 515 S.E.2d 508, 519-20 (1999); see also, State v. Wright, 322 S.C. 253, 471 S.E.2d 700 (1996); State v. Copeland, 278 S.C. 572, 300 S.E.2d 63 (1982).Â  \r\n        In South Carolina, the court must evaluate scientific evidence under Rule 702, SCRE[3], and the factors established in State v. Jones, 273 S.C. 723, 731-32, 259 S.E.2d 120, 124-25 (1979).Â  â€œIn considering the admissibility of scientific evidence under the Jones standard, the Court looks at several factors, including:Â  (1) the publications and peer review of the technique; (2) prior application of the method to the type of evidence involved in the case; (3) the quality control procedures used to ensure reliability; and (4) the consistency of the method with recognized scientific laws and procedures.Â  Council, 335 S.C. at 19, 515 S.E.2d at 517.\r\n        Mazzell offered the testimony of Timothy Williams, a polygraph examiner, to establish the requirements of Jones.Â  Williams testified that there have been conclusive studies done to establish the reliability rates of polygraph examinations.Â  Additionally, he described the quality control procedures used by various examiners to insure the accuracy of the exam.Â  However, Williams admitted there is dispute in the community about which techniques of quality control to use.Â  He consented that the reliability rates were established in laboratory settings and were not obtained from research of real-life polygraph exams. Â Finally, he stated there is at least one manual detailing how to defeat a polygraph test.\r\n        We find the testimony by Williams fails to establish the polygraphâ€™s admissibility under Jones.Â  The testimony establishes that much of the exam is â€œartâ€ and not â€œscienceâ€ and subject to the interpretations of the examiner.Â  His testimony indicated, and he admitted, that an examiner could challenge the results of another examiner.Â  We conclude Williams has failed to identify a consistent and accepted testing standard.Â  Therefore, we find the results of the polygraphs administered in this case do not meet the requirements of Rule 702 and Jones.\r\n        Even if this court were to conclude the polygraphs could be admitted at a new trial, they were merely cumulative to other evidence or impeaching of the Stateâ€™s witnesses and do not speak to Mazzellâ€™s guilt or innocence.Â  The defense spent considerable effort to discredit Hogg as a State witness, as this court found in Mazzellâ€™s direct appeal on whether the polygraph of Hogg should be admitted in conjunction with the immunity agreement: \r\n        \r\n          Finally, we are of the opinion that the polygraph results would not in any reasonable likelihood have affected the judgment of the jury as to Mazzellâ€™s guilt or innocence.Â  [citation omitted]Â  Mazzell apparently sought admission of the polygraph agreement and results to attack Hoggâ€™s credibility as a witness and to show Hogg actually killed Seagraves.Â  However, Hoggâ€™s credibility was thoroughly impeached by other evidence, including his past criminal record, his own admission that he had given false testimony in a previous trial, and his admission that he was testifying in exchange for immunity which would be revoked if he turned out to be the triggerman in the Seagraves murder.Â  The solicitor himself acknowledged to the jury that Hogg was not a believable person.Â  Admission of the results of Hoggâ€™s polygraph examination would have been merely cumulative to the other evidence impeaching his credibility.Â  Likewise other evidence was presented to the jury to prove Hogg killed Seagraves.Â  Three witnesses testified that Hogg admitted he shot Seagraves.Â  This testimony, had the jury believed it, was far better evidence of Hoggâ€™s guilt than results of a polygraph which â€œindicated deception.â€Â Â Â  \r\n        \r\n        Merriman, 287 S.C. at 88, 337 S.E.2d at 226-27.Â  The same conclusion can be reached in regards to Merrimanâ€™s and Mazzellâ€™s polygraphs.Â  Accordingly, we find the polygraph evidence fails the requirements for granting a new trial based upon after-discovered evidence.\r\n        III.Â Alternative Consideration for Writ of Habeas Corpus\r\n        Mazzell contends the trial court erred in failing to view his motion as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and in not granting relief.Â  We disagree.\r\n        Pursuant to Gibson v. State, 329 S.C. 37, 41, 495 S.E.2d 426, 428 (1998), habeas corpus is available only when other remedies, such as Post-Conviction Relief, are inadequate or unavailable.Â  Additionally, in Simpson v. State, 329 S.C. 43, 46, 495 S.E.2d 429, 431 (1998), the South Carolina Supreme Court held a petition for a writ of habeas corpus cannot be used as a substitute for an action under the Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act.Â  Finally, in Simpson, the court concluded, â€œa matter which is cognizable under the Act may not be raised by a petition for a writ of habeas corpus before the circuit or other lower courts.â€Â  Id.\r\n        The contentions raised by Mazzell could be considered for relief other than habeas corpus.Â  The allegations of misconduct were raised on direct appeal and considered by this court.Â  Consideration of his new trial evidence was made pursuant to his motion under Rule 29, SCRCrimP, or could be raised in PCR.Â  Because Mazzell had other remedies and failed to explain why those remedies were either unavailable or inadequate, the trial court did not err in refusing to grant Mazzellâ€™s alternate request for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\r\n        AFFIRMED.\r\n    HEARN, C.J., SHORT, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] The above facts are taken from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals opinion in Mazzell v. Evatt, 88 F.3d 263, 265-66 (1996).\r\n[2] It does not appear to us that this claim was actually raised by Mazzell in his PCR application; however, the allegation in his petition for habeas relief would still provide evidence that the testimony was not â€œafter-discovered evidenceâ€ sufficient to warrant a new trial.\r\n[3] Rule 702 states:Â  â€œIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-622","title":"Southeastern Realty and Construction, Inc. v.

Seibels, Jr., of Charleston; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Myron and Judy Burdge (â€œAppellantsâ€) appeal the special refereeâ€™s order denying their request for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs made pursuant to a mechanicâ€™s lien filed by Southeastern Realty and Construction, Inc. (â€œSoutheasternâ€).Â  As the prevailing party, the Burdges claim they are entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees despite the dismissal of the mechanicâ€™s lien due to Southeasternâ€™s failure to file a lis pendens.Â  We reverse and remand.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn September 30, 1999, the Burdges entered into a contract with Southeastern for the construction of a residence on Wadmalaw Island.Â  The parties agreed on a contract price of $838,979 and a period of eleven months for substantial completion of the project. \r\nOn October 9, 2001, Southeastern filed a mechanicâ€™s lien, alleging the Burdges owed $107,782.42 on the contract, which included change orders.Â  Shortly thereafter, Southeastern filed a complaint, seeking to foreclose on the mechanicâ€™s lien and alleging a cause of action for breach of contract.Â  The Burdges answered and counterclaimed, asserting causes of action for negligence, breach of contract, breach of warranty, and slander of title.[2] \r\nPursuant to section 29-5-10 of the mechanicâ€™s lien statute, the Burdges filed an offer of settlement in the amount of $10,000.[3]Â  In response, Southeastern offered to settle the case for $70,000.Â  Between the times these settlement offers were filed, the parties consented to have the case tried by the special referee.Â  \r\nThe special referee held a two-day hearing.Â  At the conclusion of Southeasternâ€™s case, the Burdges moved for a directed verdict as to the mechanicâ€™s lien action on the ground the requisite lis pendens had not been filed pursuant to section 29-5-120 of the South Carolina Code of Laws.[4] During the hearing and in a written order, the special referee granted the motion and dismissed the mechanicâ€™s lien action.Â  In so holding, the special referee found the Burdges were not entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees and costs under the mechanicâ€™s lien statute given there was no effective mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  The special referee further reasoned that the lack of a lis pendens could have been discovered at the time the mechanicâ€™s lien was filed; thus, the Burdges waived their right to an award of attorneyâ€™s fees by waiting approximately three years before raising the issue.Â  The case proceeded on Southeasternâ€™s remaining breach of contract claim and the Burdgesâ€™ counterclaims.\r\nUltimately, the special referee entered judgment against the Burdges in the amount of $36,269.27.Â  This award was based on the outstanding balance of $53,239.27 owed to Southeastern, which was offset by the damages in the amount of $16,970 incurred by the Burdges due to Southeasternâ€™s delay in completing the construction project.Â  The special referee denied both partiesâ€™ motions for reconsideration. \r\nThe Burdges only appeal the special refereeâ€™s denial of their motion for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs pursuant to the mechanicâ€™s lien.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Burdges argue the special referee erred in failing to award them attorneyâ€™s fees and costs after dismissing Southeasternâ€™s mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  In support of this argument, the Burdges contend they:Â  1) were the prevailing party because the special referee granted their directed verdict motion; 2) did not waive their right to attorneyâ€™s fees and costs; and 3) were entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees and costs because, despite the absence of a lis pendens, they had to defend against the mechanicâ€™s lien which encumbered their property.Â  We agree.\r\nAn action to foreclose a mechanicâ€™s lien is a law case in South Carolina.Â  Adams v. B &amp; D, Inc., 297 S.C. 416, 420, 377 S.E.2d 315, 317 (1989).Â  â€œIn an action at law, tried without a jury, the judgeâ€™s findings will not be disturbed unless they are without evidentiary support.â€ King v. PYA/Monarch, Inc., 317 S.C. 385, 388, 453 S.E.2d 885, 888 (1995).Â  â€œHis findings are equivalent to those of a jury in an action at law.â€Â  Id. at 389, 453 S.E.2d at 888.Â  The determination regarding the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees that should be awarded under the mechanicâ€™s lien statute is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge and his decision will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  D.A. Davis Constr. Co. v. Palmetto Props., Inc., 281 S.C. 415, 419, 315 S.E.2d 370, 372 (1984).\r\nâ€œSection 29-5-20(A) requires the court to award reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees and costs to the party defending against the mechanicâ€™s lien if the defending party â€˜prevailsâ€™ in the action.â€Â  Keeneyâ€™s Metal Roofing, Inc. v. Palmieri, 345 S.C. 550, 553-54, 548 S.E.2d 900, 902 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  To determine the â€œprevailing partyâ€ in a mechanicâ€™s lien action, this court has explained:\r\n\r\n  In the context of statutes allowing attorney fees, our supreme court has defined a â€œprevailing partyâ€ as â€œ[t]he one who successfully prosecutes the action or successfully defends against it, prevailing on the main issue, even though not to the extent of the original contention [and] is the one in whose favor the decision or verdict is rendered and judgment entered.â€Â  Heath v. County of Aiken, 302 S.C. 178, 182-83, 394 S.E.2d 709, 711 (1990)(quoting Buza v. Columbia Lumber Co., 395 P.2d 511, 514 (Alaska 1964)).Â  Thus, the court of appeals concluded in a mechanicâ€™s lien foreclosure action the party in whose favor the decision or verdict on liability is rendered is the prevailing party for purposes of awarding attorney fees.Â  See Utilities Constr. Co. v. Wilson, 321 S.C. 244, 468 S.E.2d 1 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  According to Heath, â€œa party need not be successful as to all issues in order to be found a prevailing party.â€Â  Heath, 302 S.C. at 182, 394 S.E.2d at 711; see Utilities Constr. Co., 321 S.C. at 248-49, 468 S.E.2d at 3-4.\r\n  Therefore, in a mechanicâ€™s lien action the defendant is entitled to an award of attorney fees as the prevailing party if it is determined that a mechanicâ€™s lien cannot be enforced against it.\r\n\r\nSeckinger v. The Vessel, Excalibur, 326 S.C. 382, 388, 483 S.E.2d 775, 777 (Ct. App. 1997).Â Â  Additionally, this court has stated:\r\n\r\n  A fair interpretation of the text of [section 29-5-10(a)] convinces us that it is the enforcement of the lien which confers the right to attorney fees, and not the joinder of an attempted enforcement with another non-statutory cause of action on which the lienor prevails.Â  In addition to affording an aggrieved mechanic a complete remedy for the collection of his debt, we recently held the Legislature also intended to afford a property owner a remedy where a mechanic attempts to enforce a defective or wrongful mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  \r\n\r\nUtilities Constr. Co. v. Wilson, 321 S.C. 244, 247-48, 468 S.E.2d 1, 2-3 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nTurning to the instant case, we find, and the parties do not contest, the special referee properly directed a verdict in favor of Appellants on Southeasternâ€™s action to foreclose the mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  Because Southeastern failed to file a notice of the pendency of the action, a statutory-prerequisite, the lien against the Appellantsâ€™ property was dissolved.Â  See Muller v. Myrtle Beach Golf &amp; Yacht Club, 303 S.C. 137, 140-41, 399 S.E.2d 430, 432 (Ct. App. 1990), overruled on other grounds by Myrtle Beach Hosp, Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 341 S.C. 1, 532 S.E.2d 868 (2000) (â€œA mechanicâ€™s lien is purely statutory.Â  Therefore, the requirements of the statute must be strictly followed.Â  If anyone of these requirements is not met, the lien against the property is dissolved.â€) (citations omitted).Â  The question then becomes whether Appellants were entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees pursuant to the mechanicâ€™s lien statute.\r\nInitially, we note the fact that Southeastern prevailed on its breach of contract action is not dispositive of the decision whether to award Appellants attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Instead, our focus is confined solely to the procedure outlined in the mechanicâ€™s lien statute and case law interpreting the statute.Â  \r\nGiven the special referee directed a verdict in favor of Appellants, he held as a matter of law, not based on a â€œmere technicality,â€ that Southeastern could not enforce its mechanicâ€™s lien against Appellants.Â  Based on this ruling, Appellants successfully defended against the lien and were, thus, the â€œprevailing partiesâ€ on the mechanicâ€™s lien cause of action.Â  See Keeneyâ€™s Metal Roofing, Inc., 345 S.C. at 554-55, 548 S.E.2d at 902-03 (finding Appellants were â€œprevailing partiesâ€ and, thus entitled to attorney fees pursuant to the mechanicâ€™s lien statute, where Appellants were dismissed as a party from the mechanicâ€™s lien foreclosure action based on a procedural rule and not a â€œmere technicalityâ€); Utilities Constr.

Simrill, of Hilton Head Island, for Appellant.\r\nBob J. Conley and Thomas J. Keaveny, both of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Michael Roy Didato brought suit against Respondents, alleging breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act and slander of title.Â  He appeals the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to Respondents, which found the claims were barred under the doctrine of accord and satisfaction.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn April of 1999, Michael Roy Didato bought a condominium unit at the Palmetto Bay Horizontal Property Regime (Regime).Â  Shortly after moving in, Didato switched the door on the mechanical closet adjacent to his living room and balcony with his front door.Â  Didato vacated the unit in February of 2001 and gave control of the unit to his sister, Madelaine Arata, and his father, Roy Didato.Â  \r\nGregory A. Wynn, the Regime Manager, wrote Didato on March 21, 2001, and informed him that the door exchange was prohibited.Â  Wynn contended the mechanical closet door was a common element of the Regime and the doorâ€™s removal violated the by-laws of the Regime.Â  Wynn advised Didato to place the doors back in their original positions before March 31, 2001, or the Regime would have the door to the mechanical closet replaced at Didatoâ€™s expense.Â  Didato responded by letter dated March 27, 2001, refusing to replace the doors and threatening to call the police if the Regime attempted to gain access to his unit.Â  \r\nOn April 9, 2001, Anne C. Marscher, an attorney for the Regime, wrote Didato and requested he replace the mechanical closet door.Â  The letter informed Didato that a special assessment of $50 a day would be levied against him and constitute a lien on his property if Didato failed to comply.Â  After Didato decided to sell the unit, Arata and her husband made extensive repairs to the unit.Â  Didato claims Arata replaced the mechanical door as â€œone of the first tasks [she] attended to when [she] entered the unit on March 31, 2001.â€Â  The Regime contends it did not notice the doors had been replaced until May 31, 2001, and the Regime levied fines against the unit from May 10, 2001 until that date.Â  \r\nOn June 20, 2001, Didato signed a specific power of attorney making Arata his attorney-in-fact with respect to the sale of the unit.Â  On January 8, 2002, Marscher wrote Didato and demanded payment of $1,999.56 in fines and attorneysâ€™ fees arising from the door exchange.Â  The Regime filed a lien on Didatoâ€™s unit for that amount on January 9, 2002.Â  \r\nArata hired an attorney, H. Fred Kuhn, Jr., to get the lien removed.Â  On July 11, 2002, Marscher wrote Kuhn that â€œ[p]ursuant to [their] telephone conversation . . . Michael R. Didato will not be responsible for the $1,100 billed in fines.â€Â  The Regime executed a release and satisfaction of lien with respect to the unit on July 16, 2002.Â  Arata sold the unit on July 17, 2002 and paid the Regime the remainder of the amount owed.Â  Kuhn stated he was hired to remove the lien and agreed that â€œthe parties reached a resolution as to the lien.â€Â  Likewise, Arata agreed that the lien matter â€œwas resolved by [the] release and satisfaction of the lien.â€Â  \r\nAlmost a year later, Didato filed a complaint against the Regime for breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act and slander of title.Â  The Regime answered, alleging various defenses, including accord and satisfaction.Â  The Regime made a motion for summary judgment, asserting Didatoâ€™s claims were barred under the doctrine of accord and satisfaction.[1]Â  The trial court granted the Regimeâ€™s motion.Â  Didato filed a motion to reconsider and amend judgment, which the trial court denied.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhen reviewing the grant of summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact such that the moving party must prevail as a matter of law.Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€Â  White v. J.M. Brown Amusement Co., Inc., 360 S.C. 366, 370-71, 601 S.E.2d 342, 344 (2004) (citations omitted). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Accord and Satisfaction\r\nDidato asserts the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the Regime finding Didatoâ€™s claims were barred by the doctrine of accord and satisfaction.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe elements of an accord and satisfaction are the agreement between the parties to settle a dispute (the accord), and the payment of the consideration expressed in the accord (the satisfaction).â€Â  Fanning v. Hicks,&nbsp;284 S.C. 456, 458, 327 S.E.2d 342, 343&nbsp;(1985).Â  \r\nDidato initially argues that because his sister and Kuhn made an agreement with the Regime, the Regime is precluded from asserting accord and satisfaction against Didato personally, pursuant to Brazell Brothers Contractors v. Hill, 245 S.C. 69, 138 S.E.2d 835 (1964).Â  In Brazell Brothers, the insurer for the Brazells paid Hill $475.00 in satisfaction of Hillâ€™s claims against the Brazells arising from an automobile collision.Â  Id. at 72, 138 S.E.2d at 836.Â  When the Brazells asserted a claim against Hill arising from the same accident, Hill argued the agreement with the insurer constituted a compromise and settlement of all claims arising from the accident.Â  Id. at 72-73, 138 S.E.2d at 836.Â  Because South Carolina recognizes an automobile accident as creating two separate causes of action, the Supreme Court of South Carolina held â€œ[s]ince [the Brazellsâ€™] cause of action was separate and distinct from [Hillâ€™s cause of action], we perceive no legal impediment to settlement of it alone, leaving the Brazells untrammeled in the pursuit of their own claim, as to which the [insurance] carrier owed no responsibility and had no authority.â€Â  Id. at 74, 138 S.E.2d at 837 (emphasis added).Â  Unlike the insurance carrier in Brazell Brothers, Arata acted under a power of attorney giving her authority to â€œdo all lawful acts affecting the sale of real estate.â€Â  Arata had the authority to settle all claims arising out of the lien dispute.Â  According to the statements of Arata and Kuhn, Arata intended and agreed to finally settle this dispute.Â  Therefore, Didato is bound by this agreement.\r\nDidato next argues the lien release evidences an intent to release only the claims the Regime had against Didato.Â  While the express language of the lien release indicates the Regime released all claims against Didato, it is evidence of the satisfaction, not the accord.Â  The lien release makes no mention of an agreement between Didato and the Regime.Â  In addition, it does not state what consideration for the release, if any, changed hands.Â  The agreement of the parties (the accord) occurred before the Release was executed, as evidenced by the letter from Marscher to Kuhn dated July 11, 2002.Â  The record shows only Arataâ€™s and Kuhnâ€™s statements to evidence an agreement between the parties.Â  Therefore, viewed in a light most favorable to Didato, the evidence shows the parties agreed to settle all claims arising from the lien dispute (the accord) and, in satisfaction, the Regime executed a lien release.Â Â Â Â  \r\nEven if we found the lien release provided evidence of an intention to release only the Regimeâ€™s claims against Didato, we hold accord and satisfaction would still bar Didatoâ€™s suit.Â  â€œWhen the claims of the opposing parties are viewed as a single cause of action, it is plausible to import mutuality to any settlement between them, thus barring the right of either party to pursue the other, even though the release is, by its terms, unilateral.â€Â  Brazell Bros., 245 S.C. at 74, 138 S.E.2d at 837.Â  See also B&amp;B Bail Bonds Agency of Connecticut Inc. v. Bailey, 770 A.2d 960, 963 (Conn. 2001) (â€œAlthough the case law presents the more usual use of accord and satisfaction as a defense by the debtor against the creditor, it is evident that accord and satisfaction equally applies to both parties.â€).Â  Having agreed to surrender $1,225.60 in settlement of the Regimeâ€™s claims against him, Didato cannot now argue those claims were fraudulent and deny that accord and satisfaction applies equally to bar his claims against the Regime.\r\nII. The Mechanical Closet Door and the By-Laws\r\nDidato argues a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the mechanical closet door is a common element of the Regime, and whether the exchange of the doors constituted a violation of the by-laws of the Regime.Â  These issues are not preserved for review.[2]Â  â€œIf the losing party has raised an issue in the lower court, but the court fails to rule upon it, the party must file a motion to alter or amend the judgment in order to preserve the issue for appellate review.â€Â  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant,&nbsp;338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724&nbsp;(2000).Â  The trial court in this case granted summary judgment solely on the grounds that Didatoâ€™s claims were barred by accord and satisfaction.Â  Although Didato made a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend, he merely asked the trial court to make a ruling on accord and satisfaction and neglected to ask for a ruling on whether the doors were a common element or whether exchanging the doors violated the Regime bylaws.Â  Therefore, Didato has not properly preserved these issues for appeal.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the trial courtâ€™s decision is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Although the Regime originally moved for summary judgment on two grounds, its memorandum in support of summary judgment asked for relief based only on accord and satisfaction.Â  \r\n[2] Didato argues in his memorandum in opposition to summary judgment that the issue of whether Didato â€œexercised ownership over limited common elementsâ€ by switching the doors and whether â€œthis constituted a violation of the Master Deed and By-Laws of the Regimeâ€ affects a determination of accord and satisfaction.Â  To the extent Didatoâ€™s brief can be read to reassert this position, we disagree and find that whether the mechanical closet door is a limited common element and whether Didatoâ€™s actions violated the by-laws of the Regime have no bearing on whether the parties agreed to settle the lien dispute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-631","title":"State v.

Justice, of Chester, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Michael Cunningham was convicted of first-degree burglary and sentenced to life imprisonment.Â  Cunningham appeals, contending the trial court erred in refusing to grant a mistrial after a police officer volunteered allegedly inadmissible material in response to cross-examination by defense counsel.Â  Although we find the officerâ€™s comments clearly improper, we find the error harmless.Â  We affirm. \r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  We disagree with the trial courtâ€™s ruling to the extent that it could be viewed as condoning the policeâ€™s officerâ€™s remark on cross-examination.Â  Cunningham did not present a case, and never put his character at issue so as to â€œopen the doorâ€ for purposes of Rule 404(a)(1), SCRE.Â  Furthermore, we find the officerâ€™s gratuitous statement not responsive to the question, which called for only a â€œyesâ€ or â€œnoâ€ answer.Â  \r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Due to the overwhelming evidence of guilt in this case, however, we do not find reversible error in the trial courtâ€™s denial of Cunninghamâ€™s motion for a mistrial pursuant to the following authorities:Â  State v. Stanley,&nbsp;365 S.C. 24, 33-34, 615 S.E.2d 455, 460&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005) (holding that a grant of a mistrial is a drastic action that should be exercised only when no other curative action could remove the prejudice claimed);Â  State v. Davis,&nbsp;364 S.C. 364, 409, 613 S.E.2d 760, 784&nbsp;(Ct.

Merrifield, of Beaufort; for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Randolph Murdaugh, III, of Hampton; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  James Leroy Logan, Jr., appeals his conviction in magistrateâ€™s court for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), first offense.Â  He contends the circuit court erred in failing to reverse the decision of the magistrate denying his motion for a directed verdict.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAt approximately 2:25 a.m. on October 7, 2002, South Carolina Highway Patrolman R. J. Gannon was dispatched to the scene of a single-vehicle accident at Sea Pines Circle on Hilton Head Island.Â  When he arrived, Gannon observed a vehicle â€œat a forty-five degree angle lodged in a tree.â€Â  As Gannon approached the vehicle, he noticed that another patrolman had broken out the rear passenger window and was trying to assist Logan, who was in the vehicle, until he could receive medical attention.Â  Gannon noticed â€œa very strong smell of alcoholic beverage coming from the passenger car within the vehicle.â€Â  \r\nOnce the EMS stabilized Logan, they placed him in an ambulance.Â  At that point, Gannon asked Logan for some personal information and requested his driverâ€™s license.Â  Gannon claimed that â€œ[w]hile talking with Mr. Logan, the smell of alcoholic beverage was even strongerâ€ than when he spoke with Logan in the vehicle.Â  As a result, Gannon advised Logan of his Miranda[1] rights.Â  In response to Gannonâ€™s questions, Logan told Gannon that he was on vacation, he had been â€œout on the town for the night,â€ and had been to a couple of local clubs.Â  Logan, however, could not identify the names of the clubs.Â  Because he believed Logan had been driving under the influence, Gannon requested a blood sample and informed Logan of his implied consent rights.Â  According to Gannon, Logan was unable to sign the implied consent form due to his injuries.Â  Logan declined to submit to a blood test.Â  Gannon further testified that Loganâ€™s physical condition prevented EMS from transporting him to a breathalyzer test site.Â  \r\nAt the hospital, Gannon served Logan with a notice of suspension and asked him again about the accident.Â  Logan only informed Gannon that he was not wearing his seatbelt at the time of the accident.Â  As a result, Gannon issued Logan a ticket for DUI and for a seatbelt violation.Â  On the ticket for DUI, Gannon noted in the â€œB.A. Levelâ€ box that Logan had refused this test.Â  \r\nOn October 22, 2003, a Beaufort County magistrate tried Loganâ€™s case.Â  After Gannon testified, Loganâ€™s counsel moved for a directed verdict for the DUI charge based on two primary grounds:Â  (1) there was no direct evidence that Logan was driving the vehicle at the time of the accident; and (2) there was no testimony regarding Loganâ€™s alleged impairment other than the fact that an accident had occurred and Gannon observed â€œan odor of alcoholic beverage.â€Â  The magistrate denied this motion as well as Loganâ€™s renewal of the motion after the defense rested its case without presenting testimony.\r\nIn a written order, the magistrate found Logan guilty of DUI and failure to wear a seatbelt.Â  He ordered Logan to pay a fine of $748 for DUI and $35 for the seatbelt violation.Â  In reaching his decision as to the DUI charge, the magistrate found:Â  (1) there was direct evidence that Logan was driving the vehicle at the time of the accident given he was still in the driverâ€™s seat at the time the officers arrived at the scene; and (2) Logan was driving under the influence of alcohol to the extent that his driving was impaired based on Gannonâ€™s testimony that Logan â€œsmelled of an alcoholic beverageâ€ and Logan told him that he had been to a couple of clubs prior to the accident.\r\nLogan appealed his conviction for DUI to the circuit court.[2]Â  In his notice of appeal, Logan argued the magistrate erred in declining to direct a verdict because there was no evidence that Logan was driving the vehicle at the time of the accident or that his driving was impaired.\r\nBy order dated November 16, 2004, the circuit court affirmed the magistrateâ€™s decision.Â  Logan appeals.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nLogan argues the circuit court erred in failing to reverse his DUI conviction.Â  Specifically, he contends the State failed to provide sufficient evidence that:Â  (1) he operated the vehicle involved in the accident; and (2) he was under the influence of alcohol while driving.Â  As a result, Logan asserts the magistrate should have granted his motion for a directed verdict.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn appellate court may reverse a trial courtâ€™s denial of a motion for a directed verdict only if there is no evidence to support the courtâ€™s ruling.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 555, 564 S.E.2d 87, 92 (2002). Â â€œA defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.â€Â  State v. McKnight, 352 S.C. 635, 642, 576 S.E.2d 168, 171 (2003).Â  A trial court should deny a motion for directed verdict if there is any direct or substantial circumstantial evidence that reasonably tends to prove an accusedâ€™s guilt, or from which his guilt may be fairly and logically deduced.Â  State v. Horton, 359 S.C. 555, 563, 598 S.E.2d 279, 284 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nâ€œBefore a defendant in a criminal case can be required to present a defense, the State must present some proof of the corpus delicti of the crime.Â  That is, the prosecution must show the actual commission by someone of the particular offense charged.â€Â  State v. Smith, 328 S.C. 622, 624-25, 493 S.E.2d 506, 508 (Ct. App. 1997) (citations omitted).Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œThe corpus delicti of DUI based upon alcohol is:Â  (1) driving a motor vehicle; (2) within this state; (3) while under the influence of alcohol to the extent that the personâ€™s faculties to drive are materially and appreciably impaired.â€Â  State v. Russell, 345 S.C. 128, 134, 546 S.E.2d 202, 205 (Ct. App. 2001); see State v. Salisbury, 343 S.C. 520, 524, 541 S.E.2d 247, 249 (2001) (stating â€œthe corpus delicti of DUI must be established by proof that a personâ€™s ability to drive has been materially and appreciably impaired by the use of alcohol and/or drugsâ€); see also State v. Sheppard, 248 S.C. 464, 466, 150 S.E.2d 916, 917 (1966) (â€œThe act of operating a motor vehicle with impaired faculties is the gravamenâ€ of a DUI offense.).[3]Â  â€œAll that the first element requires is that the State sufficiently prove that someone drove the automobile.â€Â  City of Easley v. Portman, 327 S.C. 593, 596, 490 S.E.2d 613, 615 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œâ€˜Under the influenceâ€™ means sufficiently under the influence as to impair the ability of such driver to operate the vehicle with reasonable care.â€Â  State v. Kerr, 330 S.C. 132, 143, 498 S.E.2d 212, 217 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  â€œThe question is not whether the defendant is drunk or intoxicated, but whether his condition is such that he could drive with due regard for others and himself.â€Â  Id. at 144, 498 S.E.2d at 217-18.\r\nâ€œProof of the corpus delicti does not have to be in the form of direct evidence; it may be established by circumstantial evidence when it is the best evidence obtainable.â€ State v. Osborne, 335 S.C. 172, 180, 516 S.E.2d 201, 205 (1999); State v. Townsend, 321 S.C. 55, 57, 467 S.E.2d 138, 140 (Ct. App. 1996) (â€œWhile evidence of the corpus delicti in a particular case must be established by the best proof attainable, direct evidence is not essential.Â  The corpus delicti may be sufficiently proved by presumptive or circumstantial evidence when that is the best obtainable.â€)(citations omitted).\r\nTurning to the instant case, we find the State presented sufficient circumstantial evidence to establish the corpus delicti of the crime of DUI.Â  Officer Gannon found an injured Logan inside a vehicle that had just been involved in a single-vehicle accident.Â  No one else was present in the vehicle.Â  Gannon, who had been trained as an accident reconstructionist, opined that Logan â€œentered the traffic circle he went straight towards the embankment, up the embankment and on a tree and he came to rest on a tree.â€Â  Gannon believed the vehicle went airborne â€œa good six, seven feetâ€ before it collided with the tree.Â  He noted on the DUI traffic ticket that the weather was â€œclearâ€ at the time of the accident.Â  Eyewitnesses to the accident were unavailable at the time of trial.Â  However, Gannon testified without objection that Logan had been driving the vehicle. [4] Â  Furthermore, Gannon stated there was â€œa very strong smell of alcoholic beverageâ€ in the vehicle and an â€œeven strongerâ€ smell when he spoke directly to Logan.Â  Logan also told Gannon that he had been â€œout on the town for the nightâ€[5] and had been to a couple of local clubs.Â  In its order, the circuit court stated that Logan â€œadmitted that he had been â€˜out on the townâ€™ at establishments that served alcoholic beverages.â€ [6] Â  Loganâ€™s inability to recall the names of the clubs gave rise to the inference that Logan was intoxicated.Â  Logan also refused to submit to a blood test.Â  Although Gannon was unable, due to Loganâ€™s physical condition, to utilize field sobriety tests or a breathalyzer test, he believed Logan had been driving under the influence.Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing, we hold the magistrate properly denied Loganâ€™s motion for a directed verdict.Â  See Portman, 327 S.C. at 596, 490 S.E.2d at 615 (finding the following constituted sufficient evidence to establish the corpus delicti of the offense of DUI:Â  â€œthe Bronco had left the road; it rested up against a tree; the manner in which the Bronco had left the road indicated the driverâ€™s operation of the vehicle had been somehow impaired; Portman rested his head against the vehicle; he smelled of alcohol; he slurred his speech, a characteristic associated with one who is intoxicated; and the investigating officer believed Portman was under the influence of alcoholâ€); see also State v. Gilliam, 270 S.C. 345, 347, 242 S.E.2d 410, 411 (1978) (holding magistrate properly denied defendantâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on the charge of DUI where operator of a tow truck found defendant alone on the passenger side of a wrecked automobile, the accident had occurred approximately fifteen minutes prior to the tow truck operatorâ€™s arrival, the operator testified defendant smelled of alcohol and appeared to be under the influence, there was testimony that defendant was â€œramblingâ€ when questioned at the hospital where he received treatment, defendant admitted he had been driving at the time of the accident, and an open container of alcohol was found in the automobile); State v. McCombs, 335 S.C. 123, 127, 515 S.E.2d 547, 549 (Ct. App. 1999) (finding trial court properly denied defendantâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on the charge of DUI where officer discovered defendant at the scene of an automobile accident in an apparent intoxicated state, defendant smelled of alcohol and failed his breathalyzer, and officer believed defendant was impaired even though officer could not safely conduct field sobriety tests).\r\nAccordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s decision affirming Loganâ€™s magistrate court conviction for DUI is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, J., concurs, and SHORT, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nSHORT, J., dissenting in part:Â  After a careful analysis of the facts in this case, I conclude there was no evidence presented that reasonably tends to prove Logan was under the influence of alcohol to an extent that his ability to drive was materially and appreciably impaired; therefore, I must respectfully dissent.Â  \r\nIn reviewing a trial courtâ€™s denial of a criminal defendantâ€™s motion for a directed verdict, the appellate court must view the record in the light most favorable to the State and remember the granting or denial of a motion for a directed verdict turns on the existence of evidence not its weight.Â  State v. Brown, 267 S.C. 311, 316, 227 S.E.2d 674, 677 (1976).Â  A motion for a directed verdict should be denied â€œif there is any evidence, either direct or circumstantial, which reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused or from which guilt may be fairly and logically deduced.â€Â  Id.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIt is unlawful, in South Carolina, for a person to drive a motor vehicle if he is under the influence of alcohol to an extent that his ability â€œto drive is materially and appreciably impaired.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2930 (1) (Supp. 2004).Â  The cases cited by the majority all contain traditional indicia of material and appreciable impairment due to the consumption of alcohol.Â  Due to the absence of such evidence in the case at bar, it should be distinguished and Loganâ€™s motion for a directed verdict should have been granted.Â Â Â  \r\nThe first case cited by the majority in support of the magistrateâ€™s denial of Loganâ€™s motion for a directed verdict is City of Easley v. Portman, 327 S.C. 593, 490 S.E.2d 613 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  The Portman case, unlike the case at bar, involved an extrajudicial confession and centered on corpus delicti.Â  Id. at 595, 490 S.E.2d at 614.Â  Therefore, while Portman may be enlightening, it does not control the case sub judice.Â  In Portman, we found the following was sufficient evidence to establish the corpus delicti of the offense of DUI: â€œthe Bronco had left the road; it rested up against a tree; the manner in which the Bronco had left the road indicated the driverâ€™s operation had some how been impaired; Portman rested his head against the vehicle; he smelled of alcohol; he slurred his speech, a characteristic associated with one who is intoxicated; and the investigating officer believed Portman was under the influence of alcohol.â€Â  Id. at 596-97, 490 S.E.2d at 615.Â  At the scene of the wreck, Portman stated, â€œI was driving the vehicle. Â Iâ€™m drunk, take me to jail.â€Â  Id. at 595, 490 S.E.2d at 614.Â  \r\nThe majority also discusses State v. Gilliam, 270 S.C. 345, 242 S.E.2d 410 (1978).Â  In Gilliam, our supreme court held that the defendantâ€™s motion for a directed verdict had been properly denied where a tow truck driver found the defendant alone in a car that had been in a single car accident fifteen minutes earlier; the tow truck driver testified that the defendant smelled like alcohol and appeared to be under the influence; the defendant was rambling at the hospital while receiving treatment; the defendant admitted he had been driving at the time of the accident; and an open container of alcohol was found in the car.Â  Id. at 347, 242 S.E.2d at 411.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nThe final case cited by the majority is State v. McCombs, 335 S.C. 123, 515 S.E.2d 547 (Ct. App. 1999). Â In McCombs, we held that the defendantâ€™s motion for a directed verdict had been properly denied where an officer arrived on the scene of a car crash; knew and recognized the defendant as the owner of the vehicle; concluded the defendant had been the driver; testified that the defendant had bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, and smelled of alcohol, and based on these observations, the officer believed the defendant was under the influence; the defendant admitted that he was the driver of the vehicle and had been drinking; and the defendantâ€™s subsequent breathalyzer test reflected a blood-alcohol level of .16 percent. Â Id. at 126, 515 S.E.2d at 548.Â Â  \r\nLike the defendants in the cases cited by the majority, Logan was involved in a car crash and smelled of alcohol.Â  However, the records in the other cases contained evidence showing traditional indicia of material and appreciable impairment due to the consumption of alcohol such as slurred speech, bloodshot eyes, rambling, testimony that the defendant appeared to be under the influence of alcohol, or an excessive blood-alcohol level.Â  There was no evidence presented at Loganâ€™s trial to show that he was materially and appreciably impaired due to the consumption of alcohol.Â  Officer Gannon testified that Logan drove straight through a traffic circle, his car left the road and hit a tree, he smelled like alcohol, he had been out to a few local clubs but could not recall their names, and that he refused a blood test.Â  He did not provide any testimony that the appellant was unsteady on his feet, slurred his speech, or was incoherent or otherwise possessed any of the generally accepted visible characteristics often associated with persons who are under the influence of alcohol.Â  \r\nAutomobile accidents happen for many different reasons, and often occur even when drivers are not impaired.Â  I am not persuaded that there is a link between a personâ€™s inability to remember the names of clubs and the consumption of alcohol, especially when the person is not from the area.Â  A refusal to submit to a blood test and the odor of alcohol may be evidence from which it can be inferred that a person has been drinking alcoholic beverages, but alone does not show material and appreciable impairment.Â Â Â  \r\nAn automobile wreck accompanied only by the smell of alcohol, a refusal of a blood test, and the driverâ€™s inability to remember the names of clubs that he had visited is not evidence from which material and appreciable impairment may fairly and logically be deduced.Â  See Brown, 267 S.C. at 316, 227 S.E.2d at 677 (a defendantâ€™s motion for a directed verdict should be granted if the evidence presented merely raises a suspicion of guilt).Â  Â Therefore, the state failed to present any evidence showing material and appreciable impairment, and Loganâ€™s motion for a directed verdict should have been granted.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r\n[2]Â Â  Logan did not appeal his conviction for violating the seatbelt law.\r\n[3]Â Â  Section 56-5-2930 of the South Carolina Code of Laws outlines the offense of DUI as follows:\r\n\r\nIt is unlawful for a person to drive a motor vehicle within this State while:\r\n(1) under the influence of alcohol to the extent that the personâ€™s faculties to drive are materially and appreciably impaired;\r\n(2) under the influence of any other drug or a combination of other drugs or substances which cause impairment to the extent that the personâ€™s faculties to drive are materially and appreciably impaired; or\r\n(3) under the combined influence of alcohol and any other drug or drugs or substances which cause impairment to the extent that the personâ€™s faculties to drive are materially and appreciably impaired.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2930 (Supp. 2004).\r\n[4]Â Â  Although we recognize that Loganâ€™s counsel objected at other points during Gannonâ€™s testimony regarding whether Logan was driving, there was one instance where he did not raise an objection.Â  Thus, we may take this testimony into consideration in reaching our decision.\r\n[5]Â Â  â€œOut on the townâ€ has been explained to mean:Â  â€œWhen you go out partying and having fun at public places like bars, restaurants, and theatres, you are â€˜out on the town.â€™â€Â  This definition may be found at www.GoEnglish.com.\r\n[6]Â Â Â Â  Logan did not challenge this finding.Â  Thus, it is the law of the case. See In re:Â  Morrison, 321 S.C. 370, 371, 468 S.E.2d 651, 653 (1996) (stating an unappealed ruling is the law of the case); Haselden v. Haselden, 347 S.C. 48, 59, 552 S.E.2d 329, 334 (Ct.

Pleasant, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Theodore Thomas Robinson (â€œHusbandâ€) appeals a family court order distributing marital property between he and his former wife, Christina Margaret Robinson (â€œWifeâ€).Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1996, Husband and Wife married in Nantucket, Massachusetts.Â  Following their marriage, Husband moved in with Wife and her three children into a Massachusetts home owned by Wife (hereinafter â€œthe Homeâ€).[2]Â  During the marriage, Wife granted Husband a one-half interest in the Home through a quitclaim deed, though she claims Husband somewhat tricked her into doing so.Â  Over the course of the marriage, Husband performed a substantial amount of work improving the Home, including masonry repair, rewiring, installing shelving units, and replacing the kitchenâ€™s sub-floor.Â  Husband claims he also paid the mortgage payments on the Home, which included the payments on a homeownerâ€™s insurance policy.Â  Wife, the sole owner of the insurance policy, claims she gave Husband monthly income she received from a prior spouse for child support to make the mortgage payments.Â  It is uncontested that the mortgage and insurance premiums were paid with marital funds.\r\nIn January 2002, the Home was completely destroyed by fire.Â  Pursuant to the insurance policy, Wife received $17,850 for rental payments, $103,177 to replace personal property, and $199,125 to rebuild the Home.Â  Following the fire, the couple decided to relocate and get â€œa fresh startâ€ on their lives and marriage.Â  Husband sold his cleaning business for $17,000.Â  Using the insurance proceeds and funds from the sale of Husbandâ€™s business, the couple made a down payment on a home in James Island, South Carolina.Â  In order to secure financing for the new home, a large amount of Husbandâ€™s credit card debt was paid off with insurance proceeds.Â  The couple also used the policyâ€™s proceeds to replace most of the familyâ€™s personal possessions destroyed by the fire.Â  In August 2002, Husband, Wife, and Wifeâ€™s two remaining dependent children moved into the South Carolina home.Â  That same month, the couple began rebuilding the Massachusetts home.Â  The rebuilding of the Home was funded entirely with Wifeâ€™s insurance proceeds, but Husband claims he contributed significantly to the organization of the rebuilding efforts.\r\nIn the months following their move to South Carolina, the coupleâ€™s relationship broke down.Â  Once in South Carolina, both parties worked only sporadically.Â  Husband claims Wife was drinking too much and acting erratically.Â  Although he concedes he lacks proof of unfaithfulness and did not assert adultery as a ground for divorce, Husband maintains the belief that Wife was having extramarital affairs with a church deacon and others during this time period.Â  Wife cites Husbandâ€™s baseless paranoia and wild accusations of infidelity as the leading cause of their marital difficulties.Â  \r\nOn March 1, 2003, Husband left the marital home and eventually moved back to Massachusetts.Â  Before leaving, Husband took Wifeâ€™s name off a joint banking account containing approximately $14,000 of Wifeâ€™s insurance proceeds.Â  He claims he spent a large portion of this money on family debts.Â  Nevertheless, Wife was left with only her monthly child support payments and three personal checks Husband left behind for her to buy groceries.Â  Husband later stopped payment on these checks.Â  On March 11, 2003, only days after leaving the marital home, Husband filed the present action for separate support and maintenance.Â  On this date, the rebuilding of the Massachusetts home had only progressed to the point of laying the foundation.\r\nThe rebuilding of the Massachusetts home was completed on December 12, 2003.Â  Shortly thereafter, the new residence sold for $365,000, resulting in a net profit of $251,499.Â  Due to the pending case, the parties agreed to disburse $40,000 of the profits equally between them (as an advance against any future award of equitable distribution) and place the remaining $211,499 in escrow until the pending resolution of this case.Â  \r\nFollowing a two-day trial on Husbandâ€™s action for separate support and maintenance, the family court entered a final order on April 22, 2004, distributing the marital property.Â  In regard to the Massachusetts home and the proceeds from its sale, the family court concluded that the asset was transmuted into marital property due to the joint title and Husbandâ€™s substantial improvements on the original home.Â  In dividing this asset, however, the court awarded Husband only twenty-five percent of the proceeds from the homeâ€™s sale.Â  Defending this division, the family court explained, â€œas a result of the wifeâ€™s prior ownership of the home, prior ownership of the insurance policy and the wifeâ€™s purchase of the home out of foreclosure, [Wife earned a] special equity that warrants wife receiving a greater percentage of the value of the marital residence.â€Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has authority to find the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â  This broad scope of review, however, does not require us to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  We remain mindful that the family court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. The Massachusetts Residence\r\nHusband contends the family court erred in awarding him only a twenty-five percent share of the proceeds from the sale of the Massachusetts residence.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe family court determined that the newly rebuilt Massachusetts home, although owned by Wife prior to the marriage, was transmuted into a marital asset.Â  See Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 295, 372 S.E.2d 107, 110 (Ct. App. 1988) (holding nonmarital property may be transmuted into marital property if:Â  (1) it becomes so commingled with marital property as to be untraceable;Â  (2) it is jointly titled; or (3) it is utilized by the parties in support of the marriage or in some other manner so as to evidence an intent by the parties to make it marital property).Â  This ruling of the family court was not appealed and is therefore the law of the case.Â  See Bakala v. Bakala, 352 S.C. 612, 632, 576 S.E.2d 156, 166 (2003).Â Â  The conclusion that the proceeds from the Homeâ€™s sale are marital property, however, does not necessarily dictate an even division of the funds.\r\nAll marital property, upon dissolution of a marriage, should be divided and distributed in a manner that fairly reflects each spouseâ€™s contribution to its acquisition, preservation, and change in value.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472(3) (Supp. 2004); Johnson, 296 S.C. at 293, 372 S.E.2d at 109.Â  In determining an equitable division of marital property, the family court must consider the factors set forth in South Carolina Code Section 20-7-472 (Supp. 2004), giving each factor the weight the court deems appropriate.Â  Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 100, 545 S.E.2d 531, 537 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  This court will affirm the family court judge if it can be determined that the judge addressed the statutory factors sufficiently for us to conclude he was cognizant of them. Id.Â  \r\nIn the present case, the family court specifically addressed in considerable detail each of the equitable apportionment statuteâ€™s fifteen enumerated factors.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2004).Â  The court determined the large profits received from the Homeâ€™s sale were largely â€œdue to the location of the home, the neighborhood it was in, and the fact that [Wife] purchased it years ago.â€Â  The court concluded Wifeâ€™s prior ownership of the home and insurance policy and her purchase of the home out of foreclosure entitled her to a larger share of the proceeds from its sale.Â  Since a spouseâ€™s contribution to acquiring a marital asset is one of the statutory factors, the family court acted within its discretion in heavily weighing Wifeâ€™s acquisition of the Home and insurance policy.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472(3) (Supp. 2004).Â  Furthermore, our own review of the record leads us to conclude Husband was generously compensated for his direct and indirect contributions to the marital residence with a twenty-five percent portion of the net sales proceeds.Â  See Johnson, 296 S.C. at 300, 372 S.E.2d at 113 (â€œ[T]his Court looks to the fairness of the overall apportionment.Â  If the end result is equitable, it is irrelevant that this court might have weighed specific factors differently than the trial judge.â€).Â  Because the family court addressed each of the statutory factors for equitable distribution, we affirm the family courtâ€™s division of this marital asset.[3]Â  See Jenkins, 345 S.C. at 100, 545 S.E.2d at 537.\r\nII. Debt Owed To Husbandâ€™s Father\r\nHusband contends the family court erred in not apportioning a debt owed to his father.Â  Specifically, he argues the couple owes his father interest payments on money that was borrowed, placed in escrow, but paid back to his father without being spent.Â  This issue is not properly preserved for our review.\r\nAlthough Husband listed the debt owed to his father in his financial declaration and vaguely referenced the loanâ€™s interest at the hearing, the family courtâ€™s order merely addresses the debt as it applies to the propertyâ€™s transmutation and does not rule upon the issue of apportioning the debt between the parties.Â  Because the family court did not specifically rule on this issue and Husband filed no Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend the courtâ€™s order, this issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  See Widman v. Widman, 348 S.C. 97, 118-19, 557 S.E.2d 693, 704-05 (Ct. App. 2001) (holding an issue must be ruled upon by the family court or raised in a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to be preserved for appellate review).\r\nIII. Funds From Joint Bank Account\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in crediting him the $7,000 he took from the coupleâ€™s joint bank account prior to leaving the marital home because the funds were spent on marital obligations.Â  We disagree.\r\nAlthough the family court order acknowledges Husband took $7,000 from the account, we find no reference to the funds in question in the apportionment of personal property and debt.Â  As such, we fail to see how Husband was actually credited this amount.Â  Furthermore, the issue of whether these funds were properly apportioned by the family court should have been raised in a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to be preserved for our review.Â  Id.Â  Raising the issue in a post-trial motion would have clarified the family courtâ€™s order, eradicating Husbandâ€™s need to speculate on appeal as to the family courtâ€™s treatment of these marital funds.\r\nIV. Husbandâ€™s Life Insurance\r\nHusband contends the family court erred in crediting him, for the purposes of equitable distribution, with the $3,249 cash value of his life insurance policy.Â  We disagree.\r\nMarital property is generally defined as all real and personal property acquired by the parties during the marriage.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2004).Â  Accordingly, any active increase in the cash value of a life insurance policy over the course of a marriage is marital property.Â  Husbandâ€™s life insurance policy was valued at approximately $3,000 when the parties married.Â  Husband, however, cashed out the policy during the marriage, rendering the policyâ€™s cash value as zero.Â  At the present litigationâ€™s time of filing, the policyâ€™s value had been built back to $3,249.Â  Because this increase in the policyâ€™s value was effectuated with marital funds over the course of the marriage, the family court properly included the asset as part of the marital estate.\r\nV. Credibility of the Parties and the Breakup of the Marriage\r\nIn a vague argument which does not request the reversal of any particular aspect of the family courtâ€™s order, Husband argues the family court erred in finding Wifeâ€™s testimony regarding the breakup of the marriage credible, while concluding that his testimony on the subject lacked credibility.Â  Concomitantly, he argues the family court erred in concluding Husband was largely to blame for their matrimonial failings.Â  Supporting his contentions, Husband devotes much of his brief to some minor inconsistencies and sporadic equivocal episodes in Wifeâ€™s testimony.Â  Although we review the facts of this case in accordance with our own view of the evidence, our deference to the family court judge regarding issues of credibility is well established.Â  See Bowers, 349 S.C. at 91, 561 S.E.2d at 613.Â Â Â  Due to the inconsequential nature of the faults in Wifeâ€™s testimony and the fact that the family court judge was in a better position to evaluate witness credibility, we affirm this aspect of the family courtâ€™s order.\r\nVI. Marital Counseling\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in failing to admit Wifeâ€™s testimony concerning marital counseling the couple received in Massachusetts.Â  This issue is not preserved for our review.\r\nPrior to trial, Husband requested that Wife willingly release records from marriage counseling the couple received in Massachusetts.Â  Wife refused to sign the release.Â  At the hearing, Husbandâ€™s attorney sought to admit both his letter requesting the release and a letter from a church counselor in Massachusetts.Â  Wifeâ€™s counselâ€™s objection to the admission of these letters was sustained and the letters were proffered into evidence.Â  Husband now argues the family court erred in not admitting Wifeâ€™s testimony regarding the counseling.Â  The questions regarding the counseling, however, ceased upon the courtâ€™s refusal to admit the letter and Wife was never further questioned on the subject.Â  Not only was no objection made addressing Wifeâ€™s possible testimony, Husbandâ€™s attorney never even posed the initial queries into the subject.Â  This issue, therefore, is not preserved for our review.Â  See Widman, 348 S.C. at 118-19, 557 S.E.2d at 704-05 (holding an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the family court or raised in a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to be preserved for appellate review).\r\nVII. The Family Computer and Major Appliances\r\nHusband also argues the family court erred in failing to credit Wife the value of the major appliances and the computer in the Charleston home.Â  Again, this aspect of the family courtâ€™s final order was not raised to the court in a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion and, thus, is not preserved for appellate review.Â  Id.\r\nVIII. Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife and, conversely, in failing to award attorneyâ€™s fees to him, because he was, in fact, the prevailing party of the litigation.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees is within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. See Bowen v. Bowen, 327 S.C. 561, 563, 490 S.E.2d 271, 272 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  In determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court should consider each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fees, the beneficial results obtained, the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions, and the effect of the fee on the partiesâ€™ standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992). \r\nIn the present case, the family court expressly considered each of these factors in considerable detail.Â  The court specifically found, as to the factor of beneficial results received by each party, that, due to the unreasonable nature of Husbandâ€™s settlement demands, it was Wife who obtained the most beneficial result of the litigation.Â  Furthermore, the family court found many of the remaining factors favored an award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife.Â  Because there is certainly evidence in the record supporting the conclusions of the family court regarding attorneyâ€™s fees, we find no abuse of discretion in the award. See Henggeler v. Hanson, 333 S.C. 598, 605, 510 S.E.2d 722, 726 (Ct. App. 1998)Â  (finding no abuse of discretion in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees when the family court considered the necessary factors and there was evidence supporting the courtâ€™s conclusions).\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the family courtâ€™s order is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The Home was awarded Wife in a prior divorce decree.Â  When Wifeâ€™s first husband ceased making court-ordered mortgage payments, Wife used borrowed money to rescue the Home from foreclosure proceedings.\r\n[3] The family court order refers to Wifeâ€™s additional twenty-five percent interest in this marital asset as a â€œspecial equityâ€ in the property.Â  Generally, the term â€œspecial equityâ€ is used to describe the special interest a spouse gains in nonmarital property by contributing to an increase in the propertyâ€™s value over the course of a marriage.Â  See, e.g., Calhoun v.
