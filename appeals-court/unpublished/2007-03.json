Howell claims the trial court rendered his guilty plea conditional by informing him of his right to appeal and to file a motion for post-conviction relief.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nHowell was indicted for first-degree burglary. Â During the plea colloquy, the trial court informed Howell that in order to plead guilty he would have to give up certain rights, and he would have the right to file an appeal and the right to file a motion for post-conviction relief.Â  The trial court went on to explain that any concerns Howell had would need to be raised at that time instead of waiting until some point in the future.Â  Howell raised no concerns to the trial court and stated that he still wanted to plead guilty.Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nConditional pleas are not valid in South Carolina. â€œPleas of guilty are unconditional, and if an accused attempts to attach any condition or qualification thereto, the trial court should direct a plea of not guilty.â€Â  Â State v.

Downs, 361 S.C. 141, 146, 604 S.E.2d 377, 379-80 (2004) (finding a guilty plea to be unconditional because defendant did not reserve the right to later deny his guilt); with State v. Oâ€™Leary, 302 S.C. 17, 17-18, 393 S.E.2d 186, 187 (1990) (finding a guilty plea to be conditional because the defendant reserved the right to challenge the constitutionality of a statute in relations to his plea). \r\nThe trial courtâ€™s explanation of the right to appeal and the right to file a motion for post-conviction relief did not render Howellâ€™s plea conditional. \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, KITTREDGE, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-103","title":"State v.

Reeves, Office of the Attorney General, of Columbia; and Solicitor John Gregory Hembree, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Adam Jackson appeals his conviction for voluntary manslaughter.Â  Jackson argues the trial court erred by suppressing evidence that the victim possessed cocaine.Â  We affirm.[1]  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn May 21, 2004, Jackson shot and killed Jessie Grissette.Â  Jackson testified that he shot in self-defense after Grissette ran up behind him, threatened to kill him, and began reaching for something in his pocket.Â  Jackson testified that he believed Grissette was reaching for a gun because he had previously seen Grissette with a gun, and during the altercation, Grissette told him he had a gun.Â Â  \r\nIn Grissetteâ€™s wallet, the police found a small sandwich baggy containing a â€œwhite powder substance.â€[2]Â  However, while the toxicology report from Grissetteâ€™s autopsy was positive for marijuana and showed a blood alcohol content of more than twice the legal limit for driving while intoxicated, there was no cocaine detected.Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nPrior to trial, the State moved to exclude any evidence concerning the white powder.Â  The trial court asked Jacksonâ€™s counsel what the relevance of the white powder would be considering no cocaine was found in Grissetteâ€™s system, and counsel was unable to offer any direct reasons for its relevance. After Jacksonâ€™s counsel stated that Grissette had allegedly previously robbed Jacksonâ€™s home to obtain money Â for drugs, the trial court stated the white powder evidence would be inadmissible unless this or other evidence â€œties him in enough that it becomes relevant.â€[3]Â Â  \r\nDuring the trial, a police officer testified on cross-examination regarding the white powder substance found on Grissette.Â  After the officerâ€™s testimony had been completed and the jury was removed from the courtroom for a break, the State cited the in limine decision and moved to strike the testimony concerning the white powder substance.Â  The trial court granted this motion over defense counselâ€™s objection and instructed the jury accordingly.Â  \r\nThe jury convicted Jackson of voluntary manslaughter, and the trial court sentenced him to ten years imprisonment.Â  This appeal followed. Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Timeliness\r\nJackson first asserts that the trial court erred in granting the Stateâ€™s motion to strike the white powder evidence because it was untimely.Â  We disagree. \r\nWhile a motion to strike may be denied due to the absence of a contemporaneous objection, the ultimate determination lies in the discretion of the court.Â  Lindsey v. City of Greenville, 247 S.C. 232, 241, 146 S.E.2d 863, 868 (1966).Â  Counsel for the State explained no objection was made at the time of the testimony because he did not wish to draw additional attention to the improper testimony.Â  The trial court accepted this reasoning and specifically found the motion to strike was timely.Â  We find no abuse of discretion.\r\nII.Â  Preservation and Res Gestae Â  \r\nJackson argues the trial court erred in suppressing evidence of the white powder substance.Â  We find this argument is not preserved for appellate review.\r\nJacksonâ€™s argument on appeal is that the mere possession of cocaine alters the brain chemistry of its owner.Â  Regardless of the merit of this argument, it is an argument which Jackson never made to the trial court.Â  â€œArguments\r\nnot raised to or ruled upon by the trial court are not preserved for appellate review.â€Â  State v. Carlson, 363 S.C. 586, 597, 611 S.E.2d 283, 288 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nLastly, Jackson argues the trial court erred in suppressing the white powder evidence because it was part of the res gestae of the incident.Â  Jackson never specifically mentioned res gestae to the trial court, but did note that the white powder evidence was relevant in terms of the â€œtotalityâ€ of the incident.Â  Regardless of this potential preservation issue, we find this argument is without merit.\r\nAn accepted basis for admitting evidence of other crimes arises when such evidence â€œfurnishes part of the context of the crimeâ€ or is necessary to a â€œfull presentationâ€\r\nof the case.Â  State v. Sweat, 362 S.C. 117, 132-33, 606 S.E.2d 508, 516 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œThe\r\nres  gestae theory recognizes evidence of other bad acts may be an integral part of the crime with which the defendant is charged, or may be needed to aid the fact finder in understanding the context in which the crime occurred.â€Â  Id. at 133, 606 S.E.2d at 517 (quoting State v. King, 334 S.C. 504, 512, 514 S.E.2d 578, 582 (1999)).Â  \r\nWe find no error with the trial courtâ€™s determination that the white powder evidence was irrelevant.Â  Because there is no evidence that this incident between Grissette and Jackson was in any way related to cocaine, the record supports a decision that the white powder evidence was not necessary to complete the story of the crime on trial.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find Jacksonâ€™s issue concerning cocaine possession affecting the brain chemistry of its owner is not preserved for our review.Â  Regarding Jacksonâ€™s other issues, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial courtâ€™s suppression of evidence.Â  Based on the foregoing, Jacksonâ€™s conviction is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, KITTREDGE, and SHORT JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Although Jackson states that victim possessed cocaine and the lawyers refer to the powder as cocaine, there is no evidence in the record that this white powder substance was analyzed and found to be cocaine.Â  Therefore, this court will not refer to the white powder substance as cocaine.Â  \r\n[3] Neither the evidence suggested by Jackson nor any other evidence which rendered the â€œwhite powderâ€ relevant was presented by Jackson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-104","title":"Jordan v.

Evans, 371 S.C. 27, 31, 637 S.E.2d 313, 315 (2006) (quoting State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 69, 406 S.E.2d 315, 328 (1991)).Â  A partyâ€™s failure to object at the time evidence is offered constitutes a waiver of the right to object.Â  Doe v. S.B.M., 327 S.C. 352, 356, 488 S.E.2d 878, 880 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œOur courts have held a failure to contemporaneously object to the introduction of evidence claimed to be prejudicial cannot be later bootstrapped by a motion for a mistrial.â€Â  State v. Stanley, 365 S.C. 24, 33, 615 S.E.2d 455, 459 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Logically flowing from this precedent is the notion that a motion for a new trial cannot cure the failure to contemporaneously object.\r\nAfter Jordanâ€™s testimony reflecting insurance coverage, her counsel failed to contemporaneously object.Â  Jordanâ€™s counsel further failed to object to the trial courtâ€™s instruction to the jury after the jury foreman presented questions concerning insurance.Â  In fact, the record fails to indicate any objection to this testimony by Jordanâ€™s counsel until after the jury rendered its verdict.Â  Any argument on appeal based upon Jordanâ€™s interjection of insurance coverage is not properly preserved for our review.Â  Since both of Jordanâ€™s arguments on appeal are based on this issue, we must dismiss this appeal.[4]Â  Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find this appeal is not preserved for our review. Based on the foregoing, Jordanâ€™s appeal is\r\n DISMISSED.[5]\r\nANDERSON, KITTREDGE, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We note the trial courtâ€™s order states that Jordan made these unsolicited comments concerning insurance coverage despite a pre-trial instruction from the court not to mention insurance.Â  Although it does not appear in the record, Martin asserts in his brief that this instruction from the court was prompted by his motion in limine requesting such instruction.Â Â  \r\n[2] The granting of this motion allowed for Martin to accept the additur or to request a new trial.Â  There is nothing in the record to indicate Martinâ€™s unwillingness to accept the additur.Â  \r\n[3] We are mindful of the very limited exception to the contemporaneous objection rule carved out in Toyota of Florence v. Lynch, 314 S.C. 257, 442 S.E.2d 611 (1994).Â  However, in this case, we find neither a vicious, inflammatory argument resulting in clear prejudice nor otherwise â€œextraordinaryâ€ circumstances which would be necessary to excuse Jordanâ€™s failure to make a\r\ncontemporaneous objection under this exception.\r\n[4] We recognize Martinâ€™s argument concerning the trial courtâ€™s failure to include in its order â€œcompelling reasonsâ€ for invading the province of the jury and awarding additur.Â  Regardless of the merits of this argument, the trial courtâ€™s decision regarding additur was never appealed by either party.Â  Jordan appealed only from the denial of her motion for a new trial absolute, and Martin did not appeal.Â  Therefore, this issue is not properly before this court.\r\n[5] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-105","title":"State v.

Kennedy, 272 S.C. 231, 234, 250 S.E.2d 338, 339 (1978).Â  The trial court issued the following charge:\r\n\r\nNow, with respect to kidnapping, section 16-3-920 says that whoever shall unlawfully seize, confine, inveigle, decoy, kidnap, abduct or carry away any other person by any means whatsoever without authority of law shall be guilty of a felony.Â  So kidnapping is the taking and carrying away of a person from one place to another however slight by unlawful force or by fraud or against that personâ€™s will.\r\nWith respect to proving kidnapping, the State must prove, first of all, that there was an intent to violate the law in this case to kidnap the victim.Â  Second, the taking by the person from one place to another, that is, from one place in the house to another or from one place in the house to another location, it makes no difference because it is the fact of removal and not the distance that constitutes kidnapping. \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Eakes argues the trial court committed reversible error in mentioning kidnapping can include moving a person â€œfrom one place in the house to another location,â€ because the facts of the case involved Eakes moving the victim from one place in a house to another.\r\nThe trial court expressed no opinion whatsoever.Â  The trial court did not make an untoward comment on the facts of the case, but simply posited a generic illustration of a legal principle.Â  The trial court merely explicated the legal concept that kidnapping can occur in a house, because kidnapping is based on the removal of a person from one place to another rather than the distance a person is removed.Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, KITTREDGE, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-106","title":"State v.

Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIUM:Â  Hollis appeals his conviction for malicious injury to personal property, unlawfully carrying a pistol, and discharging a firearm into a dwelling.Â  Hollis contends the trial judge erred in denying his motion to suppress witness identifications.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFacts\r\nIn the early morning hours of March 22, 2003, security officer Robert Moore, who was working in the parking lot of Club Matrix, escorted two men to their car and asked them to leave the premises.Â  Moore was with the men for about four to six minutes.Â  He observed the men closely so that he could recognize them in the event they attempted to return to the club.Â  As they were leaving, one of the men began shooting at the club.Â  The shooting continued as the men sped away.Â  Approximately three and one-half hours after the shooting, Moore identified Hollis as one of the two men he had escorted from the club.Â  Additionally, Moore identified the vehicle as the one involved in the incident.Â  Moore later testified he was one hundred percent certain of his identification.\r\nHollis was arrested and charged with malicious injury to personal property, unlawfully carrying a pistol, and discharging a firearm into a dwelling.Â  At Hollisâ€™s trial Moore again identified Hollis as the man he escorted to the vehicle the night of the shooting.Â  Defense counsel moved to suppress both of Mooreâ€™s identifications.Â  The trial judge denied the motion. \r\nOfficers recovered spent nine-millimeter shell casings from the roadway near Club Matrix.Â  Inside the vehicle officers found unspent nine-millimeter bullets, spent nine-millimeter shell cases, and a box that held nine-millimeter bullets.Â  A firearms expert testified the spent shell casings found at the crime scene and inside the vehicle were fired by a handgun found on Hollis at the time of his arrest.Â  Elements consistent with gunshot residue were found on the palm and back of Hollisâ€™s left hand.Â  Possible gunshot residue was found on the palm and back of Hollisâ€™s right hand. Â \r\nThe jury found Hollis guilty on all charges and the trial judge sentenced him to concurrent terms of confinement totaling ten years, suspended to eight yearsâ€™ confinement and eight yearsâ€™ probation.Â  \r\nStandard of Review\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only. Â State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 625 S.E.2d 216 (2006); State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 520, 608 S.E.2d 435 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  On appeal, we are limited to determining whether the trial judge abused his discretion. Â State v. Reed, 332 S.C. 35, 503 S.E.2d 747 (1998); State v. Walker, 366 S.C. 643, 623 S.E.2d 122 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  This same standard of review applies to preliminary factual findings in determining the admissibility of certain evidence in criminal cases.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001).Â  The appellate court does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  Id.Â  In order for an error of law to warrant reversal, the error must result in prejudice to the appellant. Â State v. Patterson, 367 S.C. 219, 625 S.E.2d 239 (Ct. App. 2006); see State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 536 S.E.2d 679 (2000).\r\nDiscussion\r\nHollis argues the trial judge erred in denying his motion to suppress the unreliable witness identifications.Â  We disagree.\r\nGenerally, the decision to admit eyewitness identifications is in the trial judgeâ€™s discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion or the commission of prejudicial legal error.Â  State v. Brown, 356 S.C. 496, 589 S.E.2d 781 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing State v. Moore, 343 S.C. 282, 540 S.E.2d 445 (2000)).Â  However, a criminal defendant may be deprived of due process of law by an identification procedure that is unnecessarily suggestive.Â  Id. (citing State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 522 S.E.2d 845 (Ct. App. 1999)).Â  â€œWhile a showup in which a witness views a single suspect is generally suggestive, and hence suspect or disfavored, and less preferable than a lineup, even if requested by accused, a showup may be proper in some circumstances.â€Â  Brown, 356 S.C. at 503, 589 S.E.2d at 785 (quoting State v. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 78, 538 S.E.2d 257, 263 (Ct. App. 2000) (internal citations omitted)); see also Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188 (1972); State v. Blassingame, 338 S.C. 240, 525 S.E.2d 535 (Ct. App. 1999)).Â  \r\nIt is well settled that reliability is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of identifications and suggestiveness alone does not mandate the exclusion of evidence. Â Brown, 356 S.C. at 504, 589 S.E.2d at 785 (citing Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98 (1977); State v. Stewart, 275 S.C. 447, 272 S.E.2d 628 (1980); Blassingame, 338 S.C. at 251, 525 S.E.2d at 541); Patterson, 337 S.C. at 229, 522 S.E.2d at 852). Â To determine whether an identification is reliable, it is necessary to consider the following factors: (1) the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime; (2) the witnessâ€™s degree of attention; (3) the accuracy of the witnessâ€™s prior description of the criminal; (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation; and (5) the amount of time between the crime and the confrontation.Â  Id. Â (citing Mansfield, 343 S.C. at 78-79, 538 S.E.2d at 263); Biggers, 409 U.S. at 199-200). Â The corrupting effect of a suggestive identification is to be weighed against these factors. See Mansfield, 343 S.C. at 79, 538 S.E.2d at 263. Â After the trial judge determines the witnessâ€™s identification is reliable, the witness is permitted to testify before the jury. Â Id.\r\nNotwithstanding the generally suggestive nature of the identification procedure employed by police in this case, Mooreâ€™s identification of Hollis was reliable in light of the totality of the circumstances.Â  The following excerpt from the record indicates the trial judge considered the relevant factors in determining the reliability of Mooreâ€™s identification:\r\n\r\nThe factors being considered by this court to determine whether or not the identification in this case is reliable include the witnessâ€™ opportunity to view the subject at the time of the events, the degree of attention paid by the witness to the individual being identified, the accuracy of the witnessâ€™ prior description of the criminal, the witnessâ€™ level of certainty at the time of the actual confrontation, and the length of time between the crime and the confrontation. . . .\r\nIn this case the witness testified that he had an excellent opportunity to view the individual that he was attempting to identify.Â  Because of the circumstances of their initial confrontation, he stated that he paid closer attention to these individuals than normal.Â  He said that he got a good idea of what they were wearing, as well as their person.Â  He saw them on that occasion and then say the individual again while being fired upon.Â  And certainly those circumstances would cause someone to pay very close attention to what was going on at that time. \r\nThe show-up identification, he stated that his certainty of his identification at one hundred percent at that time.Â  And certainly that indicates that he felt very strongly concerning his identification as being correct and independent at that time. \r\n\r\nThe witness had an extended opportunity to view Hollis while escorting him from Club Matrix, he paid close attention in the event Hollis attempted re-entry into the club, he generally described the men to the authorities, he testified he was one hundred percent certain that he made the correct identification, and he identified Hollis within approximately three and one-half hours after the shooting incident. Â The trial judge concluded the reliability factors weighed in favor of allowing Mooreâ€™s identification testimony.Â  We discern no abuse of discretion in the trial judgeâ€™s ruling. \r\nAlternatively, we consider any error in the trial judgeâ€™s conclusion concerning the identification harmless.Â  No definite rule of law governs finding an error harmless; rather, the materiality and prejudicial character of the error must be determined from its relationship to the entire case.Â  State v. Reeves, 301 S.C. 191, 391 S.E.2d 241 (1990); State v. Curry, 370 S.C. 674, 636 S.E.2d 649 (Ct. App. 2006)). Â Whether an error is harmless depends on the particular facts of each case.Â  State v. Mizzell, 349 S.C. 326, 333, 563 S.E.2d 315, 318-19 (2002) (quoting Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 684 (1986)).Â  â€œ[T]he reviewing court must review the entire record to determine what effect the error had on the verdict.â€ Â Mizzell, 349 S.C. at 334, 563 S.E.2d at 319 (internal quotations omitted).Â  Error is harmless where it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial. Â In re Harvey, 355 S.C. 53, 584 S.E.2d 893 (2003).Â  When guilt is conclusively proven by competent evidence, such that no other rational conclusion could be reached, this court will not set aside conviction for insubstantial errors not affecting result.Â  State v. Kelley, 319 S.C. 173, 460 S.E.2d 368 (1995).\r\nThe in-court identification of Hollis was cumulative to the evidence presented at trial.Â  Hollis was apprehended near Club Matrix shortly after the shooting.Â  He was carrying the pistol that was later found to be the one used in the shooting, and he had gunshot residue on one of his hands. Â The vehicle the suspects fled in contained spent shell cases that had been fired by the handgun found on Hollis at the time of his arrest.\r\nAccordingly, Hollisâ€™s conviction is affirmed.\r\n ANDERSON , KITTREDGE, AND SHORT, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-107","title":"Henry v.

Brousseau, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Â Patrick and Vivian Henry appeal the circuit courtâ€™s order upholding the decision of the magistrateâ€™s court. Â We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThis matter involves a contract dispute between landowners Patrick and Vivian Henry (hereinafter collectively referred to as â€œHenryâ€) and landscaper Michael Tucker.Â  As a result of their disagreement, Henry brought suit against Tucker in the Anderson County Magistrateâ€™s Court for breach of contract and breach of warranty.Â  Tucker counterclaimed, alleging fraud, constructive fraud, and unjust enrichment.Â  \r\nIn his original decision, the magistrate found Tucker had breached the warranty on his work and awarded Henry $2,694.00 in damages.Â  However, the court found Henry had attempted to rely on his own oral modifications to the original contract, and based upon that, as well as the equitable theory of unjust enrichment, found Tucker was entitled to damages from Henry in the amount of $2,612.00.Â  The magistrate found Tucker suffered additional damages of $82.00 as a result of delays Henry had caused.Â  This ultimately resulted in what the magistrate referred to as â€œa wash,â€ with neither party owing further compensation to the other. \r\nAfter the magistrate rendered his decision, Tucker asked that the court reconsider its decision.Â  Although never phrasing his request as a â€œMotion for Reconsideration,â€ Tucker stated: â€œMay I just bring a point, your Honor, just by way of the Courtâ€™s ruling,â€ and noted that although the court found Henry caused the project to be delayed, the magistrate failed to adequately assess the damages caused by the delays.Â  Henry filed a written motion to reconsider, arguing the court had not properly considered the damages caused by Tuckerâ€™s failure to adhere to the contractâ€™s requirements.Â  After holding a hearing on these issues, the court agreed with both movants, and the relevant damages were reassessed.Â  However, the ultimate result was the same, with neither party receiving a monetary award as a result of set-off. \r\nHenry appealed to the circuit court.Â  The circuit court judge affirmed the magistrateâ€™s decision.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe standard of review to be applied by a circuit court in an appeal from a magistrateâ€™s judgment is prescribed by the South Carolina Code:\r\n\r\nUpon hearing the appeal the appellate court shall give judgment according to the justice of the case, without regard to technical errors and defects which do not affect the merits. In giving judgment the court may affirm or reverse the judgment of the court below, in whole or in part, as to any or all the parties and for errors of law or fact.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-170 (1985).Â  This standard, and the standard applicable to this court when reviewing the circuit courtâ€™s decision, were discussed extensively in Hadfield v. Gilchrist, 343 S.C. 88, 92-94, 538 S.E.2d 268, 270-71 (Ct. App. 2000):\r\n\r\nIn Burns v. Wannamaker, 281 S.C. 352, 315 S.E.2d 179 (Ct.App.1984), this Court amplified:\r\n  \r\nAs is readily apparent, Section 18-7-170 confers authority upon the Circuit Court to reverse a magistrateâ€™s findings of fact when exercising appellate jurisdiction in an appeal from a magistrateâ€™s judgment. See Dingle v. Northwestern R. Co., 112 S.C. 390, 99 S.E. 828 (1919); Redfearn v. Douglass, 35 S.C. 569, 15 S.E. 244 (1892); cf. Vacation Time of Hilton Head Island, Inc. v. Kiwi Corp., [280 S.C. 232], 312 S.E.2d 20 (Ct. App. 1984) (where the Circuit Court reversed a magistrate's findings of fact in an ejectment action).\r\n  \r\nBurns, 281 S.C. at 357, 315 S.E.2d at 182.\r\nWhile the Circuit Court maintains a broad scope of review, our standard is more limited:\r\n  \r\n[T]he Court of Appeals will presume that an affirmance by a Circuit Court of a magistrateâ€™s judgment was made upon the merits where the testimony is sufficient to sustain the judgment of the magistrate and there are no facts that show the affirmance was influenced by an error of law [Bagnal v. Southern Express Co., 106 S.C. 395, 400, 91 S.E. 334, 335-36 (1917); Stanford v. Cudd, 93 S.C. 367, 369-70, 76 S.E. 986, 986-87 (1913); see 5B C.J.S. Appeal &amp; Error Â§ 1817 at 152-53 (1958)] . . . .\r\n  \r\nBurns, 281 S.C. at 357, 315 S.E.2d at 182. Our Supreme Court, in Stanford v. Cudd, 93 S.C. 367, 76 S.E. 986 (1913), held that where the testimony is sufficient to sustain a judgment of the magistrateâ€™s court, and it is affirmed on appeal to the Circuit Court, this Court will assume the Circuit Court affirmed the judgment on the merits, in the absence of facts showing the affirmance was controlled or affected by errors of law. The Court enunciated:\r\n  \r\nIn obedience to the statute [S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-170], the circuit court might have concluded that the magistrate erred in refusing some or all of the defendantâ€™s requests, or in admitting some or all of the testimony objected to by defendant, but the court might have thought, upon consideration of the case on the merits, that, notwithstanding such errors, the plaintiff was entitled to judgment; and as there was evidence which would have warranted such a conclusion, and as we cannot say that the judgment was affected or controlled by any error of law, it must be affirmed.\r\n  \r\nStanford, 93 S.C. at 370, 76 S.E. at 987.\r\nThe rule is articulated in Price v. Charleston &amp; W.C. Ry., 93 S.C. 576, 77 S.E. 703 (1913):\r\n  \r\nAs the circuit court is required to give judgment, in such cases, according to the justice of the case, without regard to technical errors and defects, which do not affect the merits [S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-170], and as the record does not disclose the grounds upon which the court rendered its judgment, we must assume that it was rested upon some sound and meritorious ground, and sustain it, if the record discloses any such ground.\r\n  \r\nPrice, 93 S.C. at 578, 77 S.E. at 703.\r\n\r\nIn his appeal to this court, Henry cites a number of issues for which he believes the evidence presented before the magistrate was insufficient to sustain the courtâ€™s factual findings.Â  We disagree. Â \r\nIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.Â  Townes Associates, Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â Â  â€œUnless we find an error of law, we will affirm the judgeâ€™s holding if there are any facts supporting his decision.â€Â  Hadfield, 343 S.C at 94, 538 S.E.2d at 271.Â  With each of the issues he cites, Henry fails to point out any errors of law that occurred during the trial.Â  Furthermore, the record is far from devoid of evidence to support the magistrateâ€™s decision.Â  The circuit court correctly affirmed the decision of the magistrate, who was in the best position to judge the credibility of the testimony and evidence presented.\r\nHenry avers the decision should be reversed because Tucker failed to formally reference his argument at the close of trial as a â€œmotion to reconsider.â€Â  Again, we disagree.Â  \r\nThis argument is precisely what S.C. Code 18-7-170 was intended to avoid.Â  Technical rules of procedure are not applicable in magistrateâ€™s court.Â  Wimberly v. Shorter, 204, S.C. 558, 30 S.E.2d 593, 594 (1944).Â  In the magistrateâ€™s court, pleadings, except as otherwise provided, may be oral or written, and may be in any particular form so long as they enable a person of common understanding to know what is intended.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 22-3-190 (1989).Â  \r\nAt the close of the trial, Tucker orally moved that the magistrate reconsider his ruling on the basis that the court had not assigned the appropriate monetary value to the delays Henry had caused.Â  Although Tuckerâ€™s trial counsel did not specifically use the technical words â€œmotion to reconsider,â€ it is apparent that Tucker was requesting the magistrate reconsider this issue when rendering his decision.Â  \r\nHenry subsequently filed a written motion to reconsider the magistrateâ€™s decision.Â  At the motion hearing, the magistrate allowed Tucker to argue the issue regarding the appropriate valuation of damages resulting from Henryâ€™s delays.Â  The court specifically found that Tuckerâ€™s trial counsel had presented this issue for argument at the close of trial and was treating the same as a motion to reconsider.Â  There was no error in finding Henry had moved for reconsideration.\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nAccordingly, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, KITTREDGE, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-108","title":"State v.

Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Shawn L. Reeves, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Robert M. Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Harold Justice appeals his guilty plea for common law robbery and failure to stop for a blue light.Â  He contends the trial judge erred in denying his motion to dismiss court-appointed counsel and to proceed pro se.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nAt approximately 12:40 a.m. on November 1, 2004, Justice entered a Hot Spot convenience store on Augusta Road in Greenville. Â After all of the other customers had left the store, Justice purchased a bottle of chocolate milk.Â  He then went to the candy aisle, selected four packages of Reeseâ€™s Pieces, and then walked back to the cash register.Â  When the clerk opened the register, Justice reached over the counter, told the clerk that this was a robbery, and then proceeded to take three ten dollar bills out of the cash drawer.Â  During the course of the robbery, the clerk activated a panic button which alerted law enforcement.Â  \r\nAs Justice left the scene on a motorcycle, the clerk called 911 and gave a very detailed description of Justice.Â  Officer Little, who was on patrol in the nearby area, received the dispatched information regarding the robbery.Â  Officer Little observed a motorcycle driven by someone who fit the description of the robbery suspect. Â He activated his blue lights and followed the motorcycle.Â  According to Officer Little, Justice slowed down and put on his turn signal as if he were going to stop.Â  However, instead of stopping, Justice sped off and turned down a side street. Â Ultimately, Justice crashed the motorcycle after hitting an embankment.Â  During the search of Justiceâ€™s person and a motorcycle saddlebag, Officer Little found a bottle of chocolate milk, four packages of Reeseâ€™s Pieces, and three ten dollar bills.\r\nA Greenville County grand jury indicted Justice for common law robbery and failure to stop for a blue light. \r\nOn July 21, 2005, the day Justice was scheduled to be tried for the two charges, he moved for the court to dismiss his appointed counsel.Â  Justice claimed his counsel was â€œineffectiveâ€ because he had not pursued Justiceâ€™s requests regarding certain evidence, including a store surveillance videotape of the robbery and several witnesses.Â  \r\nIn response, Justiceâ€™s counsel recounted the following history of his representation of Justice:Â  (1) Justice indicated on March 17, 2005, that he intended to plead guilty to both charges; (2) he changed his mind on May 4, 2005, and decided to go to trial; and (3) he then decided to plead guilty on July 8, 2005.Â  Counsel informed the court that he was ready to try the case if Justice did not plead guilty.\r\nThe judge denied Justiceâ€™s motion to dismiss his counsel and instructed Justice that he could either go to trial or plead guilty. Â In so ruling, the judge based his decision on the belief that Justice was â€œplaying games with the Court.â€Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â \r\nAfter conferring with his counsel, Justice decided to plead guilty.Â  After questioning Justice regarding his decision to plead guilty and instructing him on the constitutional rights that he was waiving by pleading guilty, the judge found Justice:Â  (1) understood his constitutional rights; (2) was satisfied with his counselâ€™s representation; and (3) had not been coerced or forced to plead guilty.Â  Based on these findings, the judge ruled Justice was freely and voluntarily pleading guilty. Â After the State gave a factual account of the offenses and listed Justiceâ€™s prior record, the judge heard from Justice and his counsel.Â  At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge sentenced Justice to thirteen years imprisonment for common law robbery and three years for failure to stop for a blue light.Â  The sentences were to be served concurrently.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nJustice asserts the trial judge erred in refusing to allow him to dismiss his court-appointed counsel and proceed pro se.Â  Because he was not permitted to proceed pro se, Justice contends this court should vacate his guilty plea and remand for further proceedings.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, we believe Justice has waived his right to raise this issue on direct appeal given he pleaded guilty to the charged offenses.Â  See Â Â Gibson v. State, 334 S.C. 515, 523, 514 S.E.2d 320, 324 (1999) (â€œA defendant who pleads guilty usually may not later raise independent claims of constitutional violations.â€); Rivers v. Strickland, 264 S.C. 121, 124, 213 S.E.2d 97, 98 (1975) (â€œThe general rule is that a plea of guilty, voluntarily and understandingly made, constitutes a waiver of nonjurisdictional defects and defenses, including claims of violation of constitutional rights prior to the plea. Â An accused also waives the right to trial and the incidents thereof and the constitutional guarantees with respect to criminal prosecutions.â€); State v. Snowdon, 371 S.C. 331, 333, 638 S.E.2d 91, 92-93 (Ct. App. 2006) (holding defendant, by pleading guilty, waived any objection he may have had and, therefore, could not assert any constitutionally-based violations).Â  Even if Justice properly preserved this issue, we find his argument to be without merit.Â  \r\nâ€œThe question of whether appellantâ€™s court appointed counsel should be discharged was a matter addressed to the discretion of the trial judge. Only in case of abuse of such discretion will this court interfere.â€Â  State v. Marshall, 273 S.C. 552, 555, 257 S.E.2d 740, 742 (1979).Â  The defendant bears the burden to show satisfactory cause for removal.Â  State v. Graddick, 345 S.C. 383, 386, 548 S.E.2d 210, 211 (2001).Â  In evaluating whether the trial judge abused his discretion in denying Justiceâ€™s motion, â€œthe Court may consider several factors: timeliness of the motion, adequacy of the trial judgeâ€™s inquiry into the defendantâ€™s complaint, and whether the attorney-client conflict was so great that it resulted in a total lack of communication, thereby preventing an adequate defense.â€Â  State v. Sims, 304 S.C. 409, 414, 405 S.E.2d 377, 380 (1991).\r\nApplying the above-outlined factors, we find the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Justiceâ€™s motion.Â  First, Justiceâ€™s motion was clearly untimely.Â  According to Justiceâ€™s court-appointed counsel, Justice indicated he wished to plead guilty on March 17, 2005, but then requested a jury trial on May 4, 2005, the date that his plea was scheduled.Â  On July 8, 2005, Justice again changed his mind when he decided to plead guilty.Â  On July 21, 2005, the day Justice was scheduled for trial, Justice moved to dismiss his court-appointed counsel despite his recent decision to plead guilty.Â  Secondly, the judge adequately inquired into Justiceâ€™s complaint regarding his counsel.Â  At the beginning of the hearing, the judge permitted Justice to explain the rationale behind his motion.Â  Finally, the record does not reveal that there existed any conflict between Justice and his counsel so great that it resulted in a total lack of communication.Â  Although there appeared to be a disagreement between Justice and his counsel regarding the approach to certain evidence, this alone is insufficient to constitute a lack of communication.Â  Significantly, Justice conferred with his counsel before deciding to plead guilty.Â  Additionally, Justice acknowledged, under oath, that he was satisfied with his counselâ€™s representation.Â  \r\nTo the extent Justice argues in his brief that he should have been permitted to proceed pro se, we question whether this issue was properly preserved for our review given Justice did not specifically raise this issue to the trial judge.Â  See State v. Hicks, 330 S.C. 207, 216, 499 S.E.2d 209, 214 (1998) (holding that issues not raised to or ruled upon by the trial judge are not preserved for appellate review). Although Justice indicated that he wanted to discharge his court-appointed counsel, the request was based on his belief that counsel was ineffective.Â  Thus, the motion could be construed that Justice in fact wanted different counsel.Â  Even if Justice made the motion with the intention of proceeding pro se, this implicit request was not sufficient to constitute an affirmative request or clear assertion of his right to proceed pro se.Â  See Dearybury v. State, 367 S.C. 34, 39-40, 625 S.E.2d 212, 215 (2006) (stating â€œ[t]he right to proceed pro se must be clearly asserted by the defendant prior to trialâ€); Sims, 304 S.C. at 415, 405 S.E.2d at 381 (holding defendantâ€™s contention that the trial judge erred in not allowing him to proceed pro se was without merit where defendant gave no indication of a desire to proceed pro se prior to trial).\r\nAccordingly, Justiceâ€™s convictions and sentences are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-109","title":"Scott B. v.

Maddox, Jr. and Richard H. Rhodes, both of Spartanburg, for Appellant/Respondent.\r\nJames Fletcher Thompson, of Spartanburg, for Respondents/Appellants.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The family court terminated Melissa M.â€™s (Mother) parental rights (TPR) to the two minor children, D. and G., based on two statutory grounds: (1) Mother willfully failed to provide support for the minor children, and (2) Mother had a diagnosable mental condition, unlikely to change within a reasonable time, that prevented Mother from providing minimally acceptable care for the minor children. Â The family court further determined that termination of Motherâ€™s parental rights was in the childrenâ€™s best interest. We affirm.[1]\r\nAdditionally, the family court ordered Andrea M. (Andrea) and Scott B. (Scott) to pay Motherâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Andrea and Scott argue the family court was without statutory authority to award attorneyâ€™s fees in this case.Â  We agree and vacate that part of the family courtâ€™s order. \r\nFACTS\r\nMother and Lee H. had two children during the course of an off and on relationship that began in 1999. Â D. was born on September 20, 2000 and G. was born on June 18, 2002.Â  H. left Mother in January of 2000 and was not heard from until October of that year.Â  Mother and H. resumed living together in the spring of 2001 but their relationship deteriorated.Â  On May 15, 2001, Mother was admitted to the hospital after she overdosed on drugs and cut her wrists. Â Following this first suicide attempt Andrea, Motherâ€™s sister, began helping care for D. Â In July, 2001, Mother and H. resumed their relationship. \r\nMother had been a reservist with the Air Force for approximately four years when terrorist attacks occurred in New York City on September 11, 2001. Â Subsequently, she volunteered for a thirty-day tour in Charleston that actually turned out to be a sixty-day tour.Â  Ultimately her assignment evolved into a one-year tour of active duty in Charleston. Â H. cared for D. while Mother was on duty until November 2001.Â  However, when Mother discovered H. had been using marijuana, cocaine, and methamphetamines, she made H. leave the home. Â Thereafter, Andrea and her mother helped care for D. in H.â€™s absence.Â  In October of 2001, Mother learned she was pregnant.Â  Subsequently, Mother attempted to reconcile with H. a number of times without success.Â  Her last contact with H. was in September of 2005.Â  Between October 2001 and October 2002, Andrea and Scott took care of D. for most of the time while Mother was in Charleston.Â  \r\nAfter G.â€™s birth on June 18, 2002, Mother experienced postpartum depression.Â  In June of 2003, at a birthday party for G., Mother slurred her words and fell out of a chair.Â  On that same occasion, Andrea noticed D. had bruises on his face.Â  After talking with D. about the bruises Andrea became concerned about his safety.Â  In February and July of 2004, Mother was hospitalized again for suicide attempts by overdose.Â  Mother left a note to her parents before the July 2004 suicide attempt, stating, â€œAndrea and Scott will make excellent parents, they can provide a life for those children I never could.â€Â  The record indicates multiple hospitalizations for suicide ideation, depression, and drug abuse during 2003 and 2004.Â  Â \r\nDuring 2003, Andrea and Scott and Motherâ€™s parents assisted in caring for the children.Â  By 2004, Andrea and Scott took care of D. frequently.Â  In addition, Andrea often interacted with G. at Motherâ€™s residence when she picked D. up or returned him home.Â  In February of 2004, Andrea delivered D. to Motherâ€™s house and discovered the home was a â€œdisaster area.â€ The disarray of the home and Motherâ€™s lethargic condition caused Andrea concern about Motherâ€™s ability to take care of D.Â  Andrea brought D. back to her house, where he remained for the following week.Â  \r\nFollowing an emergency hearing on August 26, 2004, the family court awarded temporary custody of D. and G. to Andrea and Scott by order dated October 18, 2004.Â  Mother testified she did not provide any financial support for her children during the first eleven months they were in Andrea and Scottâ€™s custody.Â  She explained Andrea never asked for any support.Â  Mother began making fairly regular support payments in July 2005.Â  Additionally, she made approximately six $16 payments to D. and G.â€™s daycare center.Â  In the event she won custody of the children, Mother testified she would probably temporarily go back on food stamps.Â  \r\nAndrea and Scott married on July 7, 2005, after being together fifteen years. Â Andrea testified â€œwe felt like we needed to make our commitment to one another legal so we could make the commitment to the children together.â€Â  Scott had developed a strong relationship with the children.Â  He earned approximately $140,000 in 2005 and Andrea earned approximately $35,000.Â  By order dated August 9, 2005, the family court terminated Motherâ€™s parental rights and awarded her attorneyâ€™s fees. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn a TPR case, the best interest of the child is paramount.Â  Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Before forever terminating parental rights, the alleged grounds for termination must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Richberg v. Dawson, 278 S.C. 356, 357, 296 S.E.2d 338, 339 (1982); S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  On appeal, this court may review the record and make its own determination whether the termination grounds are supported by clear and convincing evidence. S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 293, 547 S.E.2d 506, 509 (Ct. App. 2001). Despite the broad scope of review, this court should not wholly disregard the family court findings because the family court is in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and assign weight to their testimony. Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.&nbsp; Failure to Support\r\nSection 20-7-1572 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005), provides that the family court may terminate parental rights based on one or more of the eleven listed statutory grounds and on the finding that termination is in the best interest of the child.Â  The family court identified section 20-7-1572(4) as one of the grounds for termination of Motherâ€™s parental rights.Â  Section 20-7-1572(4) provides for TPR if:\r\n\r\nthe child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period of six months, and during that time the parent has wilfully failed to support the child. Â Failure to support means that the parent has failed to make a material contribution to the child's care. Â A material contribution consists of either financial contributions according to the parentâ€™s means or contributions of food, clothing, shelter, or other necessities for the care of the child according to the parent's means. Â The court may consider all relevant circumstances in determining whether or not the parent has wilfully failed to support the child, including requests for support by the custodian and the ability of the parent to provide support\r\n\r\nThe record contains ample evidence that the children were with Andrea and Scott for eleven months and Mother made no financial contributions to their support during that time.Â  The family court found Mother had a history of putting her own needs ahead of her childrenâ€™s and Motherâ€™s payment of child support in July 2005 was judicially motivated.Â  The family court did not err in terminating Motherâ€™s parental rights for failure to support.\r\nII.&nbsp; Diagnosable Condition \r\nAs an additional ground the family court cited section 20-7-1572(6) that provides for TPR if:\r\n\r\nthe parent has a diagnosable condition unlikely to change within a reasonable time including, but not limited to, alcohol or drug addiction, mental deficiency, mental illness, or extreme physical incapacity, and the condition makes the parent unlikely to provide minimally acceptable care of the child. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(6) (Supp. 2005).\r\nThe family court heard testimony from Stephen M. Gedo, Jr., Ph.D., Cheryl Fortner-Wood, Ph.D., Kim Rosborough, MSW, and Janis D. Browning,\r\nD.O.&nbsp; \r\nDr. Gedo believed Mother needed life long medication and had the potential to become suicidal again.Â  He stated the greatest predictor for suicide is past attempts, followed by having relatives who attempt suicide.Â  Mother has two uncles who committed suicide.Â  Dr. Gedo had concerns about the safety of D. and G. if they were returned to Motherâ€™s custody.Â  \r\nDr. Cheryl Fortner-Wood testified that Andrea, Scott, and the children had formed a secure attachment.Â  Dr. Fortner-Wood opined that removing the children from an environment with a secure attachment would adversely impact the childrenâ€™s development.Â  \r\nKim Rosborough testified as an expert in child psychology, trauma to children, and childrenâ€™s therapy. Â Rosborough expressed concern about Motherâ€™s history of treatment failures.Â  She stated that children can be a significant stressor for a parent and the stress of caring for the children may contribute to continued recurrences of depressive episodes.Â  Rosborough observed that Mother had been stable without having the stress of having the children with her. \r\nDr. Browning testified Mother had made significant progress with her depression, functioning well with goals, and trying to improve her situation.Â  However, Dr. Browning noted Mother discontinued her treatment because of concern her treatment may adversely affect her case.\r\nBased on the collective and uncontradicted testimony of Dr. Gedo, Dr. Fortner-Wood, and Rosborough, the family court concluded Motherâ€™s mental status fit within the statutory classification in 20-7-1572(6).Â  Moreover, Motherâ€™s own expert, Dr. Browning, testified to the likelihood that Mother would experience recurrences of her depression.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Best Interest \r\nOnce a statutory ground has been proven, section 20-7-1572 requires that the best interest of the child must be served by the parental rights being terminated.Â  In a TPR case, the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Smith, 343 S.C. 129, 133, 538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nCindy Rawlings, the owner and director of D. and G.â€™s current daycare center, testified the children were always late when Mother brought them to day care and that Mother appeared to be more focused on her own needs rather than on the childrenâ€™s.Â  Rawlings stated that Mother was the â€œworst parent Iâ€™ve ever seen,â€ and she claimed Mother verbally abused D.Â  Andrea helped with D. and G.â€™s tuition and supplies for the daycare.Â  Since Andrea received custody of D. and G., Rawlings testified the children have arrived on time, appear to be happy, and have a good relationship with Andrea.Â  \r\nDr. Cheryl Fortner-Wood testified that Andrea, Scott, and the children have a secure attachment and removing the children from that secure attachment environment would adversely impact the childrenâ€™s development.Â  Given Motherâ€™s suicide attempts by overdose and depression, the childrenâ€™s lives with Mother lacked stability and security.Â  Dr. Gedo had concerns about the safety of D. and G. if they were returned to Motherâ€™s custody.Â  Moreover, Andrea and Scott have been able to provide for D. and G. financially and emotionally, whereas Mother has not.Â  \r\n\r\nThe family court found:\r\nGiven [Motherâ€™s] multiple suicidal gestures, multiple hospitalizations, abuse of illegal and prescription drugs, the stressor that the children constitute for her, and her diagnoses, this Court finds that returning the children to [Mother] will constitute unreasonable risk to the children, and to [Mother] herself.Â  [Motherâ€™s] recurrent depression has served a paralyzing effect on her ability to parent.\r\n\r\nIV. Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nâ€œIt is well settled that an award of attorneyâ€™s fees is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will\r\nnot be disturbed absent an abuse of that discretion.â€Â  Smith v. Smith, 308 S.C. 492, 496, 419 S.E.2d 232, 234-35 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  However, â€œ[a]ttorneyâ€™s fees are not recoverable unless authorized by contract or by statute.â€ Â S. C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Tharp, 312 S.C. 243, 245-46, 439 S.E.2d 854, 856&nbsp;(1994) (citing Hegler v. Gulf Ins. Co., 270 S.C. 548, 243 S.E.2d 443 (1978)).\r\nSection 15-77-300 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) provides attorneyâ€™s fees for a prevailing party in a civil action brought by the State or a State subdivision such as DSS.Â  However, this case was a private cause of action for termination of parental rights.Â  Additionally, although section 20-7-420 of the South Carolina Code provides the family court with a basis for awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to a spouse in marital litigation, that section has no application to private actions for the termination of parental rights.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420 (Supp. 2005).Â  Therefore, the family court erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe family court properly terminated Motherâ€™s parental rights based on Motherâ€™s failure to support, Motherâ€™s diagnosable condition, and because termination was in D. and G.â€™s best interests.Â  Thus, the termination of Motherâ€™s parental rights is affirmed.Â  However, no contract or statute provided for attorneyâ€™s fees for this case; therefore, the family court erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The award of attorneyâ€™s fees is thereby vacated.Â  Accordingly, the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED IN PART. \r\nANDERSON, KITTREDGE, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument, pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-110","title":"Holmes v.

Collie, of Sullivans Island, for Appellant.\r\nJames Kevin Holmes, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Cynthia Holmes (Mother) appeals the family courtâ€™s orders[1] denying her motion for an order prohibiting James Kevin Holmes[2] (Father) from taking the partiesâ€™ two minor children out of the country before there is a final determination of permanent custody. Â We dismiss this appeal as moot.[3]\r\nFACTS\r\nAfter a twenty-five-year marriage, the parties divorced on January 30, 2004.Â  Three children were born to the marriage.Â  Of the three children, two are still minors.Â  Although neither party has been awarded custody of these children, they reside with Mother, who has been their primary caretaker.Â  \r\nIn anticipation of the childrenâ€™s school vacation, Mother filed a motion in March of 2006 in which she sought an order from the family court prohibiting Father from taking the children out of the country pending resolution of the custody issue.Â  Specifically, Mother moved before the family court for an order prohibiting Father from taking the partiesâ€™ minor son on a vacation to Miami, Florida and the Bahamas from April 8 through April 16, 2006.Â  \r\nOn April 6, 2006, the family court held an emergency hearing on Motherâ€™s motion.Â  At the hearing, both Mother and Father proceeded pro se.Â  In support of her motion, Mother expressed she was concerned that Father would abscond with the minor child if he was permitted to leave the country before the issue of custody was resolved.Â  In response, Father stated he had no intention of absconding with the child.Â  He further explained that:Â  he was a thirty-year member of the South Carolina Bar Association; he was employed by a Charleston law firm; he owned property in Charleston, and had strong community ties in the area; his son spends every weekend with him; and he and his son had previously taken vacations to Hawaii, New Jersey, Washington, D.C., North Carolina, and Georgia without incident. Â He also informed the court that he and his son were going to meet the partiesâ€™ twenty-one-year-old daughter in Miami and then go to the Bahamas. \r\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the court orally ruled that Father â€œbe allowed to take the child on the planned vacation, with the child being returned to the mother per the itinerary that has been set out.Â  And that will be the times for the visitation.â€Â  \r\nBy written order dated the day of the hearing, the court denied the motion without explanation.Â  The next day, April 7, 2006, the court issued a written order in which he elaborated on his ruling with findings of fact and conclusions of law.Â  Mother appeals both orders.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nIn her appeal, Mother argues the family court erred in:Â  (1) failing to comply with Rule 41.1 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure by considering the partiesâ€™ sealed 1998 action for separate support and maintenance; (2) ruling where it did not have jurisdiction to issue an order â€œpurportedly operational, in whole or in part, outside the borders of the U.S.â€; (3) issuing orders which are â€œnull and voidâ€ because they are unenforceable outside the territorial limits of the United States; (4) â€œfailing to recognize the courtâ€™s interest in maintaining jurisdiction pending final adjudication on the meritsâ€ of the custody issue; (5) â€œfailing to recognize the purpose of the temporary hearing as preservation of the status quo pending an adequate factual showing at a full and fair hearing on the meritsâ€; and (6) issuing two different orders from the same hearing.Â  Based on these alleged errors, Mother contends the family courtâ€™s orders should be reversed in the interest of â€œsubstantial justice affecting substantial rights.â€Â  For reasons that will be discussed, we find Motherâ€™s appeal is moot and we need not address these issues.Â  \r\nâ€œGenerally, this Court only considers cases presenting a justiciable controversy.â€Â  Sloan v. Friends of Hunley, Inc., 369 S.C. 20, 25, 630 S.E.2d 474, 477 (2006).Â  â€œA justiciable controversy exists when there is a real and substantial controversy which is appropriate for judicial determination, as distinguished from a dispute that is contingent, hypothetical, or abstract.â€ Id.\r\nâ€œA moot case exists where a judgment rendered by the court will have no practical legal effect upon an existing controversy because an intervening event renders any grant of effectual relief impossible for the reviewing court. If there is no actual controversy, this Court will not decide\r\nmoot or academic questions.â€Â  Seabrook v. Knox, 369 S.C. 191, 197, 631 S.E.2d 907, 910 (2006)(citations omitted); see Collins Music Co. v. IGT, 365 S.C. 544, 549, 619 S.E.2d 1, 3 (Ct. App. 2005), cert. denied (Dec. 7, 2006)(noting a matter becomes moot when some event occurs making it impossible to grant effectual relief).\r\nIn the orders at issue, the family court made the limited ruling of denying Motherâ€™s motion and permitting Father to take one of the partiesâ€™ minor children on a vacation to Miami, Florida and the Bahamas from April 8 through April 2006.Â  Even if we were to find the family court erred in denying Motherâ€™s motion, our decision would have no practical effect on this controversy given the vacation at issue is over.Â  Because a decision on this issue would not grant Mother any effectual relief, we hold the appeal is moot. \r\nFurthermore, after reviewing the case, we do not believe any exceptions to the mootness doctrine are applicable.Â  See Collins Music Co., 365 S.C. at 549, 619 S.E.2d at 3 (â€œIn civil cases, there are three exceptions to the\r\nmootness doctrine:Â  (1) an appellate court can retain jurisdiction if the issue is capable of repetition yet evading review, (2) an appellate court can decide cases of urgency to establish a rule for future conduct in matters of important public interest, and (3) if the decision by the trial court can affect future events or have collateral consequences to the parties, the appellate court can take jurisdiction.â€).Â  Accordingly, we dismiss Motherâ€™s appeal as moot.\r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED.\r\nHUFF, BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp;\r\nMother filed a separate appeal for each of these orders.Â  Because the appeals involve identical issues, this court granted Motherâ€™s motion to consolidate the appeals into one opinion.Â  See Rule 214, SCACR (â€œWhere there is more than one appeal from the same order, judgment, decision or decree, or where the same question is involved in two or more appeals in different cases, the appellate court may, in its discretion, order the appeal to be consolidated.â€).\r\n[2]&nbsp; Father did not file a Respondentâ€™s Brief.\r\n[3]&nbsp; Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-111","title":"Village West v.

Gregory, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-111\r\nSubmitted February 1, 2007 â€“ Filed March 7, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJack D. Simrill, of Hilton Head Island, for Appellant.Â  \r\nEdward E. Bullard and Sonja N. Friedman, both of Hilton Head Island, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  International Sales and Marketing Group appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order granting Village West Horizontal Property Regime summary judgment.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Village West Horizontal Property Regime consists of three phases.Â  Phases I and II contain the Schooner, Clipper, Galleon, and Flagship buildings.Â  Phase III contains the Spinnaker Building.Â  International Sales and Marketing Group owned Unit 14 in the Spinnaker Building.\r\nThe misapplication of synthetic stucco in Phases I and II caused water intrusion in those buildings.Â  Consequently, the regime filed suit against the developer.Â  The suit was settled, and the regime paid court costs and attorneyâ€™s fees from the settlement.Â  The remaining proceeds were not enough to repair the buildings.Â  Because of this deficiency, the regimeâ€™s board of directors included the cost of repairing these buildings in its annual assessment against all unit owners in Phases I, II, and III.Â  \r\nOn March 21, 2005, the regime filed suit against International for its failure to pay this assessment.Â  During the pendency of the action, International sold Unit 14 and paid the assessment in order to consummate the transaction.Â  However, International refused to stipulate to the dismissal of the regimeâ€™s suit.Â  The regime then moved for summary judgment, asking the circuit court to dismiss the action and award attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nIn response, International moved to amend its answer, asserting counterclaims against the regime for return of its payment and unfair or deceptive trade practices.Â  International contended the assessment was improper because the Spinnaker Building was not water damaged and therefore not the subject of repair.Â  International also argued the regimeâ€™s by-laws prohibited the assessment.Â  \r\nThe circuit court held a hearing and granted the regime summary judgment, holding the regimeâ€™s by-laws permitted the assessment.Â  International moved for reconsideration, which the circuit court denied.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn appellate court reviews the grant of summary judgment under the same standard applied by the circuit court.Â  David v. McLeod Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 247, 626 S.E.2d 1, 3&nbsp;(2006).Â  The circuit court should grant summary judgment â€œif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€ Â Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Byrd v. City of Hartsville, 365 S.C. 650, 656, 620 S.E.2d 76, 79&nbsp;(2005).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Law v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648&nbsp;(2006).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  The Regimeâ€™s By-Laws\r\nInternational argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to the regime because the regimeâ€™s by-laws prohibited the assessment.Â  Specifically, International contends Articles IX and X of the by-laws require the regime to assess only the unit owners whose units are damaged.Â  Alternatively, International maintains the by-laws are ambiguous.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe operative documents that govern a horizontal property regime constitute a contract between the association and its individual members.Â  Swanson v. Parkway Estates Townhouse Assâ€™n, 567 N.W.2d 767, 768&nbsp;(Minn. Ct. App. 1997); see also Reyhani v. Stone Creek Cove Condo. II Horizontal Prop. Regime, 329 S.C. 206, 211-13, 494 S.E.2d 465, 468-69&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997) (applying principles of contract law to interpret the operative documents of a horizontal property regime).Â  The interpretation of a clear and unambiguous agreement is a question of law for the court. Â Stribling v. Stribling, 369 S.C. 400, 404, 632 S.E.2d 291, 293 (Ct. App. 2006). \r\nIn construing a contract, the primary objective is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties.Â  D.A. Davis Constr. Co., v. Palmetto Props., Inc., 281 S.C. 415, 418, 315 S.E.2d 370, 372&nbsp;(1984).Â  The partiesâ€™ intention should first be determined from the language of the contract.Â  Schulmeyer v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., 353 S.C. 491, 495, 579 S.E.2d 132, 134&nbsp;(2003).Â  â€œIn general, if the contract is unambiguous, clear, and explicit, it must be construed according to the terms the parties have used, and the terms are to be taken and understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense.â€Â  Ingram v. Kaseyâ€™s Assocs., 340 S.C. 98, 110, 531 S.E.2d 287, 293&nbsp;(2000).Â  \r\n\r\nArticle IX of the regimeâ€™s by-laws provides, in pertinent part:\r\n  \r\nIn the event of casualty loss or damage to the Property, the [regimeâ€™s] Board of Directors shall be responsible for applying the proceeds of all casualty insurance to the repair or reconstruction of the Property in accordance with the provisions of this ARTICLE IX . . . . Â If less than two-thirds (2/3) of the Property is destroyed or substantially damaged, then such Property shall be repaired in the following manner:\r\n. . . .\r\n(3) Â If the insurance proceeds paid to the Board are insufficient to cover the cost of reconstruction, the deficiency shall be paid as a special assessment by the Unit Owners whose units are being reconstructed or repaired in proportion to the damage done to their respective Units.Â  \r\n  \r\nArticle X of the regimeâ€™s by-laws reads, in relevant part:\r\n  \r\n(2) Â Insurance proceeds paid on account of loss or damage to less than all of the Units, when the damage is to be restored, shall be held [by the Regimeâ€™s Board of Directors] for the benefit of Unit Owners of the damaged Units . . . in proportion to the costs of repairing each damaged unit.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\nUsing these provisions, International asserts the regime could not require unit owners in the Spinnaker Building to pay for reconstruction and repair costs with respect to the other buildings in the regime.Â  We disagree.\r\nArticles IX and X of the regimeâ€™s by-laws are not applicable to the present case.Â  A\r\ncontract is read as a whole document so that one may not, by pointing out a single sentence or clause, create an ambiguity.Â  S. Atl. Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Middleton, 356 S.C. 444, 447, 590 S.E.2d 27, 29&nbsp;(2003).Â  In this case, the opening paragraph of Article IX refers to â€œcasualty loss or damage to the Property . . .â€ and â€œthe proceeds of all casualty insurance.â€Â  The remainder of Article IX guides the board in how to apply these proceeds and what procedure to follow if the proceeds are deficient.Â  The clear, unambiguous intent of this provision is to provide the board guidance in the event of a casualty loss or damage caused by a casualty.Â  The damage at issue was the result of negligent construction so that the casualty provisions are not implicated.\r\nMoreover, we agree that other provisions within the regimeâ€™s master deed and by-laws specifically allow the assessment.Â  Article V, Section (e) of the master deed reads, in part:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe obligations of all Unit owners with regard to assessments for common expenses and the maintenance and repair of the individual Units shall be as provided in the By-Laws of the [Regime] . . . .\r\n\r\nArticle VII, Section 6(c) of the by-laws provides, in part:\r\n  \r\nAll maintenance, repair and replacement to the common elements as defined in the Master Deed, the painting and decorating of the exterior doors and exterior window sash and the washing of exterior glass shall be made by the [Regimeâ€™s] Board [of Directors] . . . and shall be charged to the Unit Owners as a common expense . . . .\r\n  \r\n\r\nArticle VIII, Section A(1) of the master deed defines the regimeâ€™s common elements, which include â€œthe foundations, roofs, perimeter walls, [and] walls and partitions separating units . . . .â€Â  \r\nIn this case, the parties do not dispute the relevant repairs involved application of stucco on the walls of the buildings.Â  Accordingly, the regimeâ€™s master deed and by-laws clearly provide for the assessment of all unit owners for construction defects with respect to any of the buildings within the regime.Â  Additionally, this language complies with statutory law and the general purpose behind horizontal property regimes.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-31-190 (Rev. 2007) (â€œThe co-owners of the apartments are bound to contribute pro rata . . . toward the expenses of administration and of maintenance and repair of the general common elements.â€).\r\nII. Â Genuine Issues of Material Fact\r\nInternational maintains the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment because several genuine issues of material fact exist for trial.Â  Specifically, International contends the following factual issues should be submitted to a jury: Â (1) whether the assessment would be used to make repairs to the Spinnaker Building; (2) whether Articles IX and X of the by-laws prohibited the regimeâ€™s use of the assessment to make repairs on the buildings; and (3) whether the repair and reconstruction would be made to individual units or common elements.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn light of our holding above, the issue of whether the assessment would be used to make repairs on the Spinnaker Building is immaterial.Â  Additionally, we have held the by-laws are clear and unambiguous.Â  Consequently, we have decided the issue of whether Articles IX and X prohibit the assessment as a matter of law.Â  Moreover, International produced no evidence repairs would be made to individual units within the regime.Â  In fact, International argued the assessment would be used to pay for water damage caused by the use of synthetic stucco on the buildings.Â  Therefore, we hold the circuit court properly found no genuine issues of material fact existed for trial.\r\nIII. Â Timing of Summary Judgment\r\nInternational argues the circuit court erred by prematurely granting summary judgment.Â  International did not make this argument until it filed its Rule 59, SCRCP, motion.Â  â€œA party cannot for the first time raise an issue by way of a Rule 59(e) motion which could have been raised at trial.â€Â  Patterson&nbsp;v. Reid, 318 S.C. 183, 185, 456 S.E.2d 436, 437&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995).Â  Therefore, International did not preserve this issue for our review.\r\nIV. Â The Business Judgment Rule\r\nAs an alternative sustaining ground, the regime contends the business judgment rule prevents Internationalâ€™s counterclaims.Â  In response, International contends this issue is not preserved because the circuit court failed to rule on the issue.Â  We hold the regime properly preserved this issue and agree with the regime on the merits.\r\nâ€œUnder the present rules, a respondentâ€”the â€˜winnerâ€™ in the lower courtâ€”may raise on appeal any additional reasons the appellate court should affirm the lower courtâ€™s ruling, regardless of whether those reasons have been presented to or ruled on by the lower court.â€Â  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 419, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723&nbsp;(2000).Â  Accordingly, the regime may raise the issue of whether the business judgment rule prohibits Internationalâ€™s counterclaims on appeal.\r\nThe regime is a non-profit corporation. Â Under the business judgment rule, a court will not review the business judgment of a corporate governing board when it acts within its authority, and it acts without corrupt motives and in good faith.Â  Dockside Assâ€™n, Inc. v. Detyens, 291 S.C. 214, 217, 352 S.E.2d 714, 716&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1987) (applying the business judgment rule to the assessment decision of a horizontal property regimeâ€™s board of directors) affâ€™d, 294 S.C. 86, 362 S.E.2d 874&nbsp;(1987).Â  International produced no evidence of bad faith or the failure of the regime to act within its scope of authority in levying and applying the assessment.Â  Accordingly, we hold the business judgment rule prevents Internationalâ€™s counterclaims.\r\nV. Â Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nInternational contends the circuit court erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to the regime for proceedings occurring after payment of the assessment.Â  International did not raise nor did it obtain a ruling from the circuit court on this issue.Â  Therefore, International failed to preserve it for our review.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733&nbsp;(1998) (â€œ[A]n issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).Â  \r\nBased on all of the foregoing, the decision of the circuit court is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-112","title":"Whetsell v.

Richardson, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this appeal from the family court, Linda Whetsell (Wife) appeals the family courtâ€™s failure to grant her a divorce on the grounds of adultery and desertion.Â  Wife also contends the family court erred in failing to award her alimony and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. \r\nFACTS\r\nKermit Whetsell (Husband) and Wife married on June 26, 1971.Â  Toward the end of the marriage, Husband regularly returned home late at night. Â On July 14, 2002, Husband returned home around four oâ€™clock in the morning, and Wife became upset and asked him to leave.Â  Since that time, Husband and Wife have lived at all times in separate households.Â  On August 29, 2004, Wife filed for divorce on the grounds of adultery, desertion, and one yearâ€™s continuous separation.Â  Wife also requested alimony and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The parties reached an agreement regarding the division of marital assets and debts.Â  \r\nPursuant to the agreement, Wife received the marital home, two vehicles, fifty percent of Husbandâ€™s pension plan, and the partiesâ€™ time share, which was in foreclosure.Â  Also, Wife received fifty percent of Husbandâ€™s 401(k) account, offset by the value of her 401(k) account, which she retained in full.Â  Husband received his share of inherited family property, a 1981 double-wide home, two vehicles, and the remaining funds in his pension and 401(k) plans.Â  Additionally, the parties were solely responsible for the mortgages, taxes, and insurance on their respective assets as well as for their own debts. \r\nAt the time of the divorce hearing, Wife was 52 years old and Husband was 54 years old.Â  Wife worked as a medical courier and had gross earnings of $1,780.72 per month and net earnings of $1,156 per month.Â  Husband worked as a meter reader and had gross earnings of $3,144.26 per month and net earnings of $2,214.91 per month.Â  In 2004, Husband reported earnings of $41,969.41 and Wife reported earnings of $22,439.25.Â  \r\nAt the hearing, Wife testified the marriage had been â€œa roller coaster ride.â€Â  The marriage was damaged by Husbandâ€™s gambling and involvement with pornography.Â  She testified they used to take family trips around the country, but since the separation, her lifestyle was â€œalmost null and voidâ€ because she did not have â€œmuch money to [be able to] do anything.â€Â  Following the separation, she has been experiencing financial difficulty and has received help from her family to buy food and to pay her phone bill.Â  Further, her brother and sister paid for her to go to a family reunion because she could not afford it. Â Wife claimed that after their separation, Husband continued to bowl regularly and take trips.Â  \r\nWife testified she believed Husband had an affair because he was never home. Â He would sometimes not tell her who he was with, and she testified he told her that he had found someone else.Â  She believed Husband had an affair with Loretta Coker because he is currently living at Cokerâ€™s residence.Â  As further evidence of Husbandâ€™s alleged adultery, Wife presented a charge to â€œFlowers and Thingsâ€ on the partiesâ€™ joint bank statement, made after their separation, for flowers she neither sent nor received.Â  On cross-examination, Wife acknowledged that on the day she alleged flowers were purchased for $7.50, Flowers and Things credited the account $14.\r\nWifeâ€™s niece, Milicent Haynes, testified she saw Husband at a basketball game with Coker. Â Haynes stated they were not â€œlovey-dovey.â€ Â In fact, Husbandâ€™s grandson was sitting between the two of them.Â  Haynes testified that Husbandâ€™s daughter had pointed out Coker at the mall as â€œdaddyâ€™s girlfriend or friend.â€Â  \r\nHusband responded that he currently resides in the residence with Coker, her uncle, and her granddaughter.Â  Further, he pays rent of $434 per month. Â He admitted that he gambled during the marriage and that he still occasionally gambles.Â  \r\nHusband acknowledged that during the marriage, he stayed out until four oâ€™clock in the morning on occasion but claimed Wife knew he was going to see his brotherâ€™s band.Â  He acknowledged gambling during the marriage and that he still occasionally gambles. Â \r\nThe family court found Wife failed to prove adultery by a clear preponderance of the evidence and granted the divorce on the ground of one yearâ€™s continuous separation.Â  Based upon the sole finding that neither party was more at fault in causing the breakup of the marriage, the family court denied Wife alimony.Â  Further, the family court ordered the parties to pay their own attorneyâ€™s fees and costs. Â The family court approved the partiesâ€™ agreement and resolved the remaining issues.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from a family court order, this Court has authority to correct errors of law and find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â \r\nE.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 473, 415 S.E.2d 812, 814 (1992).Â  When reviewing decisions of the family court, we are cognizant of the fact that it had the opportunity to see the witnesses, hear â€œthe testimony delivered from the stand, and had the benefit of that personal observance of and contact with the parties which is of peculiar value in arriving at a correct result in a case of this character.â€ Â DuBose v. DuBose, 259 S.C. 418, 423, 192 S.E.2d 329, 331 (1972); see also \r\nScott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003) (â€œBecause the family court is in a superior position to judge the witnessesâ€™ demeanor and veracity, its findings should be given broad discretion.â€). \r\nWhen the evidence is conflicting and susceptible of different inferences, the family court has the duty of determining not only the law of the case, but the facts as well, because it had the benefit of observing the witnesses and determining how much credence to give each oneâ€™s testimony. Â Anders v. Anders, 285 S.C. 512, 514, 331 S.E.2d 340, 341 (1985); see also Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996) (holding when evidence is disputed, the appellate court may adhere to the family courtâ€™s findings). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Divorce on the Ground of Adultery\r\nWife argues the family court erred in failing to grant her a divorce on the ground of adultery.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œ[P]roof of adultery as a ground for divorce must be clear and positive[,] and the infidelity must be established by a clear preponderance of the evidence.â€ Â Odom v. Odom, 248 S.C. 144, 146, 149 S.E.2d 353, 354 (1966).Â  A â€œpreponderance of the evidenceâ€ is evidence which convinces as to its truth. Â DuBose v. DuBose, 259 S.C. 418, 424, 192 S.E.2d 329, 331 (1972).Â  Because of â€œthe clandestine natureâ€ of adultery, obtaining evidence on the commission of the act by eyewitness testimony is rarely possible, and direct evidence is not necessary to establish the charge.Â \r\nFulton v. Fulton, 293 S.C. 146, 147, 359 S.E.2d 88, 88 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  \r\nAdultery may be proven by circumstantial evidence, but it â€œmust be so convincing as to exclude any other reasonable hypothesis but that of guilt.â€ Â Fulton, 293 S.C. at 147, 359 S.E.2d at 88.Â  Proof of adultery by circumstantial evidence must establish both a disposition and opportunity to commit the offense. Â Hartley v. Hartley, 292 S.C. 245, 247, 355 S.E.2d 869, 871 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Generally, â€œproof must be sufficiently definite to identify the time and place of the offense and the circumstances under which it was committed.â€ Â Loftis v. Loftis, 284 S.C. 216, 218, 325 S.E.2d 73, 74 (Ct. App. 1985). Â However, a divorce on the ground of adultery should be denied if proof of the offense is inconclusive following the consideration of all the evidence. Â Rabon v. Rabon, 289 S.C. 49, 53, 344 S.E.2d 615, 617 (Ct. App. 1986).\r\nWifeâ€™s only evidence of adultery is Husband now resides, along with two other individuals, in a house owned by Coker.Â  Husband and Coker also bowl together, occasionally have dinner with one another, and they attend basketball games together.Â  Wife also testified that Husband told her he found someone else. Â Evidence placing a spouse and a third party together on several occasions, without more, does not warrant the conclusion that the spouse committed adultery.Â  Fox v. Fox, 277 S.C. 400, 402, 288 S.E.2d 390, 391 (1982).Â  \r\nWife fails to provide convincing evidence of Husbandâ€™s romantic demonstrations toward Coker.Â  See McElveen v. McElveen, 332 S.C. 583, 598, 506 S.E.2d 1, 8 (Ct. App. 1998) (â€œ[T]here is virtually no evidence of a romantic or sexual relationship between the two. Â The trial judge commented in his final order on the lack of evidence to support a showing\r\nof inclination, noting there were no love letters, romantic cards, no hand-holding, hugging, kissing, or any other romantic demonstrations or actions between the two.â€).Â  Wife may have demonstrated opportunity for Husband to commit adultery, but she presented no evidence that Husband ever was alone with the alleged paramour, nor any evidence of a romantic relationship between the two.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the family court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Wifeâ€™s request for a divorce on the ground of adultery.\r\nII.Â  Divorce on the Ground of Desertion\r\nNext, Wife maintains the family court erred in failing to grant her a divorce on the ground of desertion.Â  \r\nWe decline to address this issue because it is not preserved for our review.Â  Although Wife raised this issue in her complaint, the family court failed to rule on it, and Wife did not file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion.Â  When the family court makes a general ruling on an issue, but it does not address the specific argument raised by the appellant, and the appellant does not make a motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to obtain a ruling on the argument, this Court cannot consider the argument.Â  Floyd v. Floyd, 365 S.C. 56, 73, 615 S.E.2d 465, 474 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Accordingly, Wifeâ€™s request for a divorce on the grounds of desertion is not preserved for review on appeal.\r\nIII.Â  Alimony\r\nWife argues the family court erred in denying her request for alimony.Â  We agree.\r\nThe amount to be awarded for alimony, as well as a determination of whether the spouse is entitled to alimony, is within the sound discretion of the family court.Â  Smith v. Smith, 264 S.C. 624, 628, 216 S.E.2d 541, 543 (1975).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the decision is controlled by an error of law or is based on factual findings that are without evidentiary support.Â \r\nDegenhart v. Burriss, 360 S.C. 497, 500, 602 S.E.2d 96, 97 (Ct. App. 2004). Â \r\nThe purpose of alimony is to place the supported spouse, as close as is practical, in the same position of support as during the marriage.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988). Â If the claim for alimony is well-founded, the family court has the duty of making â€œan alimony award that is fit, equitable, and just.â€Â  Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 184, 554 S.E.2d 421, 424 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The family court must consider the following factors in awarding alimony: \r\n\r\n(1) the duration of the marriage together with the ages of the parties at the time of the marriage and at the time of the divorce or separate maintenance action between the parties; (2) the physical and emotional condition of each spouse; (3) the educational background of each spouse, together with need of each spouse for additional training or education in order to achieve that spouseâ€™s income potential; (4) the employment history and earning potential of each spouse; (5) the standard of living established during the marriage; (6) the current and reasonably anticipated earnings of both spouses; (7) the current and reasonably anticipated expenses and needs of both spouses; (8) the marital and nonmarital properties of the parties, including those apportioned to him or her in the divorce or separate maintenance action; (9) custody of the children, particularly where conditions or circumstances\r\nrender it appropriate that the custodian not be required to seek employment outside the home, or where the employment must be of a limited nature; (10) marital misconduct or fault of either or both parties, whether or not used as a basis for a divorce or separate maintenance decree if the misconduct affects or has affected the economic circumstances of the parties, or contributed to the breakup of the marriage, except that no evidence of personal conduct which may otherwise be relevant and material for the purpose of this subsection may be considered with regard to this subsection if the conduct took place subsequent to the happening of the earliest of (a) the formal signing of a written property or marital settlement agreement or (b) entry of a permanent order of separate maintenance and support or of a permanent order approving a property or marital settlement agreement between the parties; (11) the tax consequences to each party as a result of the particular form of support awarded; (12) the existence and extent of any support obligation from a prior marriage or for any other reason of either party; and (13) such other factors the court considers relevant.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2005).\r\nFurther, the South Carolina Supreme Court has stated: â€œThree important factors in awarding periodic alimony are (1) the duration of the marriage; (2) the overall financial situation of the parties, especially the ability of the supporting spouse to pay; and (3) whether either spouse was more at fault than the other.â€Â  Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 529, 599 S.E.2d 114, 121 (2004).Â  \r\nIn its order, the family court held: â€œ[N]either party is more at fault than the other [in] causing the breakup of the partiesâ€™ marriage.Â  Therefore, [Wifeâ€™s] request for alimony is denied.â€Â  The family court failed to mention any of the other thirteen factors or reference the statute.Â  Our case law and court rules are clear that the family court must make specific findings of fact on the record for each of the required factors that the court considers in making its decisions.Â \r\nGriffith v. Griffith, 332 S.C. 630, 646, 506 S.E.2d 526, 534-35 (Ct. App. 1998); see also Atkinson v. Atkinson, 279 S.C. 454, 456-57, 309 S.E.2d 14, 15 (Ct. App. 1983) (holding the family court, on remand, must set forth specific findings of fact concerning alimony factors).\r\nRule 26(a), SCRFC, provides that â€œ[a]n order or judgment pursuant to an adjudication in a domestic relations case shall set forth the specific findings of fact and conclusions of law to support the courtâ€™s decision.â€Â  When an order violates Rule 26(a), SCRFC, this Court may remand the matter to the family court, or if the record is sufficient, make its own findings of fact in accordance with the preponderance of the evidence. Â Holcombe v. Hardee, 304 S.C. 522, 524, 405 S.E.2d 821, 822 (1991).Â  \r\nIn the present case, we make our own findings of fact and find Wife is entitled to an award of alimony.Â  While these statutory factors are not the only ones to consider in awarding alimony, we believe they provide a sufficient basis to support an award of alimony. Â The parties were married for thirty-three years.Â  Husband earns significantly more than Wife. Â On their 2004 income taxes, Husband reported earnings of $41,969.41 and Wife reported earnings of $22,439.25.Â  Husbandâ€™s current expenses are $2,359.63 and Wifeâ€™s expenses are $2,210.69.Â  Because Husband earns significantly more than Wife, we surmise that while his expenses are only slightly higher, he can pay them with greater ease than Wife.Â  Husband appears to enjoy the same or a similar standard of living that he was accustomed to during their marriage. On the other hand, the record indicates that Wifeâ€™s standard of living was higher during the partiesâ€™ marriage, and due to the divorce, she now experiences financial difficulties. Â Â An award of alimony would place Wife in a position of support similar to that which she enjoyed during marriage. See Smith, 264 S.C. at 628, 216 S.E.2d at 543.\r\nBecause the record provides sufficient evidence to support an award, we find the family court erred in denying Wife alimony.Â  We remand to the family court to determine the proper amount of alimony considering all of the factors, not just fault.Â  Furthermore, once the family court determines the appropriate award, Wife is entitled to retroactive alimony from the date of the original order.\r\nIV.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nWife argues the family court erred in denying her request for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We agree.\r\nThe family court has discretion in deciding whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, and its decision will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion. Â Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 365, 384 S.E.2d 741, 748 (1989).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the decision is controlled by an error of law or is based on factual findings that are without evidentiary support.Â \r\nDegenhart, 360 S.C. at 500, 602 S.E.2d at 97.Â  \r\nSection 20-7-420(A)(38) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) authorizes the family court to award attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  In deciding whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court should consider: (1) each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fee; (2) the beneficial results obtained by the attorney; (3) the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions; and (4) the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â \r\nE.D.M., 307 S.C. at 476-77, 415 S.E.2d at 816.Â  If an award of attorneyâ€™s fees is appropriate, the reasonableness of the fees should be determined according to:\r\n(1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) the professional standing of counsel; (4) the contingency of compensation; (5) the beneficial results obtained; and (6) the customary legal fees for similar services.Â \r\nGlasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 314 (1991).\r\nAs with alimony, â€œ[o]ur case law and court rules make clear that when a contract or statute authorizes an award of attorneyâ€™s fees, the trial court must make specific findings of fact on the record for each of the required factors to be considered.â€ Â Griffith, 332 S.C. at 646, 506 S.E.2d at 534-35; see also Atkinson, 279 S.C. at 457, 309 S.E.2d at 16 (remanding to the family court for specific findings of fact in determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees).Â  The family court did not make any findings of fact or acknowledge the appropriate factors in determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Accordingly, we remand the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees to the family court. \r\nAdditionally, the award of alimony is a beneficial result, which will bear on the family courtâ€™s decision to award attorneyâ€™s fees. Â In light of this fact, the family court should reconsider the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Peirson v. Calhoun, 308 S.C. 246, 255, 417 S.E.2d 604, 609 (Ct. App. 1992); see also Epperly v. Epperly, 312 S.C. 411, 416, 440 S.E.2d 884, 886-87 (1994) (â€œAs to the beneficial result obtained, it is clear that Wife did not prevail in\r\nthe initial action. Â However, upon appeal, she has succeeded in part. Â Therefore, this issue is remanded to the [f]amily [c]ourt for reconsideration.â€).Â  On remand, the family court should consider all of the factors set forth in\r\nE.D.M., make the appropriate findings of fact, and decide whether to award Wife attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  If the family court awards Wife attorneyâ€™s fees, it should determine what amount to award according to the factors provided in Glasscock.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly the family courtâ€™s decision is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.[1]\r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-113","title":"McCarthy v.

Greene, Greene Law Firm, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nStephen L. Brown and Elizabeth B. Luzuriaga, Young Clement Rivers, LLP, of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Sharon McCarthy filed a claim for compensation with the Workerâ€™s Compensation Commission.Â  The single commissioner denied her claim, and an appellate panel of the Commission (as the ultimate fact-finder) affirmed.Â  The circuit court, sitting in its appellate capacity, affirmed.Â  McCarthy appeals, and we affirm.[1]\r\n1.&nbsp; McCarthy first argues the Commission erred in rejecting the expert testimony of Lawrence C. Davis, a Microsoft certified systems engineer.Â Â  This argument fails because Davisâ€™s testimony was not rejected by the Commission.Â  It is clear from the record that the Commission both admitted and considered Davisâ€™ evidence.Â  The Commission simply did not assign it any significant weight.Â  The single commissioner concluded, â€œthe work order issued on June 27, 2002 carries little weight with regard to the issue of a causal relationship between the Claimantâ€™s work environment and her ongoing neck condition.â€Â  Such determinations of weight are within the purview of the Commission and will not be disturbed on appeal.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (2006) (â€œThe court may not substitute its judgment for the judgment of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.â€); see also Fields v. Regâ€™l Med. Ctr. Orangeburg,&nbsp;363 S.C. 19, 25-26, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509&nbsp;(2005) (â€œQualification of an expert and the admission or exclusion of his testimony is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court . . . the trial courtâ€™s decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.â€).Â  â€œExpert medical testimony is designed to aid the Commission in coming to the correct conclusion; therefore, the Commission determines the weight and credit to be given to the expert testimony.Â  Once admitted, expert testimony is to be considered just like any other testimony.â€Â  Tiller v. Natâ€™l Health Care Ctr. of Sumter,&nbsp;334 S.C. 333, 340, 513 S.E.2d 843, 846&nbsp;(1999) (internal citations omitted).Â  \r\n2.&nbsp; McCarthy further argues the Commission applied an incorrect standard of proof to her claim.Â  McCarthyâ€™s argument relies on the statement in the Commissionâ€™s order that â€œsubstantial and convincing evidence connecting the Claimantâ€™s job to her injuryâ€ is required, arguing this is error and that the applicable standard is preponderance or greater weight of the evidence.Â  This issue is not preserved for review, as it was not ruled upon by the circuit court in its order and McCarthy did not make a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment. See Shealy v. Aiken County,&nbsp;341 S.C. 448, 460, 535 S.E.2d 438, 444-45&nbsp;(2000).\r\n3.&nbsp; McCarthy argues the Commissionâ€™s finding that she did not suffer a compensable work-related injury is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.Â  We disagree.Â  There is considerable and substantial evidence in the record that McCarthyâ€™s injuries did not have a provable link to her work conditions.Â  Dr. Marzluff, who treated McCarthyâ€™s condition for over a decade, stated that â€œI cannot say with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the problems related to her work station were the causes of her neck pain.â€Â  Dr. Khoury corroborated Marzluffâ€™s evaluation, stating â€œit would have to be something pretty unusual about her work station that would have caused this problem.â€Â  The record contains substantial evidence to support the Commissionâ€™s finding that McCarthy did not suffer a compensable injury to her cervical spine arising out of her working conditions.Â  Accordingly, the finding must be affirmed.Â  Tiller, 334 S.C. at 338, 513 S.E.2d at 845 (â€œThis Court must affirm the findings of fact made by the Commission if they are supported by substantial evidence.â€).\r\n4.&nbsp; Finally, McCarthy disputes the Commissionâ€™s findings that she did not sustain a compensable emotional â€œpsychological overlayâ€ injury.Â  This argument fails because any â€œpsychological overlayâ€ claim is necessarily dependent upon an underlying compensable physical injury.Â  See Shealy,&nbsp;341 S.C. at 457, 535 S.E.2d at 443 (â€œMental or nervous disorders are compensable accidental injuries under the statute when â€˜the emotional stimuli or stressors are incident to or arise from unusual or extraordinary conditions of employment.â€™â€).Â  Because we affirm the Commissionâ€™s finding that McCarthy did not suffer a compensable injury to her cervical spine arising out of her working conditions, there is no need to address this issue.Â  Whiteside v.

Â Thereafter, Doctors filed two motions to compel Green to provide information pertaining to her expert witness.Â  In July 2004, Green named her expert, but withdrew the expert on January 11, 2005, indicating she would get another expert.\r\nOn January 13, 2005, the trial court issued a scheduling order, which required Green to name an expert witness by April 1, 2005.Â  The scheduling order also required a deposition of the expert by May 15, 2005, and completion of all discovery by September 15, 2005.Â  On June 27, 2005, Doctors informed Green by letter that she had yet to provide notice of her expert in accordance with the scheduling order.Â  Doctors then requested that Green provide the expertâ€™s information at that time.Â  Green did not respond to Doctorsâ€™ request. Â \r\nOn October 5, 2005, Doctors moved for summary judgment against Green.Â  On October 10, 2005, Greenâ€™s counsel moved to be relieved as counsel because he did not believe Green had a case and he considered it futile to continue the case.Â  On the same date, the trial court held a hearing on all pending motions.Â  The trial court denied Greenâ€™s counselâ€™s motion to be relieved and granted summary judgment to Aiken Regional Medical Center.[2]Â  The trial court held Doctorsâ€™ motions in abeyance because ten days notice had not been provided to Green.Â Â  \r\nAlso at the October 10th hearing, Green informed the trial court that she did not have an expert witness who could provide testimony of proximate cause and damages to sustain her case.Â  Because Green had ten (10) days to respond to Doctorsâ€™ motions for summary judgment, the trial court afforded Green ten (10) days to also name an expert witness and move to expand the scheduling order.Â  On October 12, 2005, Green named the expert in her supplemental answers to the Doctorsâ€™ interrogatories; however, she did not move to expand or amend the scheduling order.[3]Â  \r\nOn October 19, 2005, Doctors informed Green by letter that it was their position that the January 13th scheduling order remained in effect until it was amended by court order.Â  On November 2, 2005, Green provided the expertâ€™s affidavit to Doctors.Â  On November 7, 2005, Greenâ€™s counsel sought consent from Doctors to continue the hearing set for November 8, 2005, or that he be allowed to participate in the hearing by way of telephone, because he was, at the time, preparing for a different trial.Â  Doctors did not consent to a continuation of the hearing.Â  Greenâ€™s counsel also requested of the trial court a continuation on the same grounds, but the court denied the request.Â  On November 8th, Green sent Doctors her response opposing summary judgment, along with the expertâ€™s affidavit.Â  Green sent the trial court a copy of the response and affidavit via facsimile on the same date.Â  \r\nAlso on November 8th, in Greenâ€™s counselâ€™s absence, the trial court heard Doctorsâ€™ October 5th summary judgment motion.Â  The trial court granted the motion on November 10, 2005 on the grounds that Green had not complied with the scheduling order.Â  On November 28, 2005, Green moved to reconsider the summary judgment award and amend the scheduling order. Â Â The trial court denied Greenâ€™s motion for reconsideration on January 23, 2006 on the ground that Green neglected to timely move for an amendment of the scheduling order.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the circuit courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment, the appellate court is instructed to apply the same standard that governs the circuit court under Rule 56(c) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493-94, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  To determine whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences, which can reasonably be drawn therefrom, must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Faile v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Juvenile Justice, 350 S.C. 315, 324, 566 S.E.2d 536, 540 (2002).Â  If triable issues exist, those issues must go to the jury.Â  Young v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 333 S.C. 714, 718, 511 S.E.2d 413, 415 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nOn the other hand, summary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.Â  Vermeer Carolinaâ€™s, Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Corp., 336 S.C. 53, 59, 518 S.E.2d 301, 305 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  All ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed most strongly against the moving party.Â  Bayle v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 120, 542 S.E.2d 736, 738 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them, summary judgment should be denied.Â  See Hall v. Fedor, 349 S.C. 169, 173-74, 561 S.E.2d 654, 656 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Summary judgment is a drastic remedy; it should therefore be cautiously invoked to prevent the improper deprivation of a trial of the disputed factual issues.Â Â  Lanham v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, 349 S.C. 356, 363, 563 S.E.2d 331, 334 (2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Factual Findings for Summary Judgment \r\nGreen contends the trial court erred in its factual findings, which led to dismissing her medical negligence action.Â  Green specifically contends the trial court erred in finding that she did not present her expertâ€™s affidavit to the trial court or opposing counsel.Â  We disagree.\r\nA scheduling order may be altered or amended whenever justice so requires.Â  See Rule 26(f), SCRCP.Â  Accordingly, the trial court in this case informed Green of its willingness to amend the order, but only if Green both named her expert and moved to expand the order.Â  Within the ten-day period provided Green by court order, Green only named her expert, but did not move to expand the scheduling order.Â  Within the ten-day period, Doctors even reminded Green, by letter, that the January 13th scheduling order remained in effect until it was amended by court order.Â  However, Green still did not move to amend the scheduling order by October 20th.Â  Green, instead, waited until November 28, 2005, to move to amend the order.Â  \r\nAs the trial court concluded, â€œnotice of an expert witness after the time required by a scheduling order is no notice until, and if, the order is amended.â€Â  Therefore, even though Green presented her expertâ€™s affidavit to the trial court, she did not do so until November 8, 2005, eighteen days after the deadline given her by the trial court.Â  Because Green did not fully comply with the courtâ€™s order, her eventual submission of the expertâ€™s affidavit could not be considered. \r\nMoreover, and despite Greenâ€™s contention, the trial courtâ€™s finding that Green did not present her expert affidavit to the trial court or Doctors, did not ultimately lead to the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of Greenâ€™s medical negligence action.Â  The trial court dismissed the action because, at the time of the summary judgment hearing, the January 13th scheduling order was still in effect, and Green provided notice of her expert without amending the order. \r\nII.&nbsp; Appropriateness of Sanction \r\nGreen contends the trial courtâ€™s sanction dismissing her case was unduly harsh and not in conformity with South Carolina precedent.Â  We disagree. \r\nâ€œIf a party fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, the trial court may impose sanctions such as striking pleadings, dismissing the action, or rendering a default judgment.â€Â \r\nGriffin Grading &amp; Clearing v. Tire Serv. Equip. Mfg. Co., Inc., 334 S.C. 193, 198, 511 S.E.2d 716, 718 (Ct. App. 1999); Rule 37(b)(2)(B), SCRCP (stating that if a party fails to obey an order to permit discovery or fails to obey a scheduling order, the trial court may make an order refusing to allow the disobedient party to support or oppose designated claims or defenses or prohibiting him from introducing designated matters in evidence).Â  \r\nAdditionally, whenever a trial court orders default or dismissal as a sanction for discovery violation, or sanction itself results in default or dismissal, the trial court must determine whether there is some element of bad faith, willfulness, or gross indifference to the rights of other litigants.Â  Karppi v. Greenville Terrazzo Co., Inc., 327 S.C. 538, 543, 489 S.E.2d 679, 682 (Ct. App. 1997); Baughman v. Am. Tel. and Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 109, 410 S.E.2d 537, 542 (1991) (holding that where the effect of excluding a witness as a sanction will be the same as granting judgment by default or dismissal, a preclusion order may be made only if there is some showing of willful disobedience or gross indifference to the rights of the adverse party).Â Â  \r\nHere, even upon acknowledging that the exclusion of a witnessâ€™s testimony should not be lightly invoked, the trial court found that Green willfully disregarded the order of the court, to which she consented, establishing a schedule for discovery.Â  As further basis for the trial courtâ€™s finding of willfulness, the trial court acknowledged that the scheduling order not only required Green to provide notice of an expert by April 1, 2005, but the order also required Green to make the expert available for a deposition by May 15, 2005 and to complete discovery by September 15, 2005.Â  The trial court additionally acknowledged that Doctors notified Green, during June 2005, that she had not complied with the scheduling order and requested that she comply by providing notice of the expert.Â  \r\nThis case is distinct from Orlando v. Boyd, in which the Supreme Court reversed the trial courtâ€™s award of summary judgment on the ground that the appellantsâ€™ efforts to comply with the scheduling order did not constitute willful disobedience of the order.Â  320 S.C. 509, 466 S.E.2d 353 (1996).Â Â Â  In Orlando, the trial court issued a scheduling order, which required the plaintiffs to make their experts available for deposition by August 3, 1992.Â  Id. at 510, 466 S.E.2d at 354.Â  The plaintiffs did not comply with the scheduling order.Â  Id.Â  Following the respondentsâ€™ motion to dismiss, on September 9, 1992, the plaintiffs moved to extend the time to depose the expert.Â  Id.Â  The trial court denied the plaintiffâ€™s motion and granted respondentsâ€™ summary judgment motion on the basis of the plaintiffâ€™s failure to follow the scheduling order.Â  Id.Â  Upon review, the Supreme Court found there was neither evidence of intentional misconduct in the record which would warrant the exclusion of the expert, nor was there evidence the respondents were prejudiced by the failure to depose the expert.Â  Id. at 512, 466 S.E.2d at 355.Â  \r\nAs distinct from Orlando, in the present case, the record demonstrates that Green repeatedly failed to comply with the trial courtâ€™s orders.Â  Also, unlike Orlando, Green did not move to extend the scheduling order.Â  Based on Orlando, the trial courtâ€™s sanction dismissing Greenâ€™s case on the basis of failure to comply with more than one court order was not unduly harsh.\r\nThis case is also distinct from Kirkland v. Peoples Gas Co., upon which Green relies in support of this appeal.Â  269 S.C. 431, 237 S.E.2d 772 (1977).Â  In Kirkland, the Supreme Court determined whether proper notice had been given to appellants of respondentâ€™s witness, when appellant had the witnessâ€™s report, interviewed him prior to trial, and listed him as one of his own witnesses.Â  Id. at 435, 237 S.E.2d at 774.Â Â  In response to Appellantâ€™s motion to exclude Respondentâ€™s witness, the Supreme Court held that because Appellant had prior knowledge of the existence and testimony of the witness, exclusion of the witness was not justified, even if Respondent violated a circuit court rule.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nIn the present case, exclusion of the expert could be justified because Doctors did not have an opportunity to depose the expert and had no knowledge that Green would name the same expert that she previously withdrew.Â  Therefore, the trial courtâ€™s sanction dismissing Greenâ€™s case, in conformity with South Carolina precedent, was not unduly harsh.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the trial court did not err in its factual findings or abuse its discretion in dismissing Greenâ€™s medical negligence case.Â  Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s award of summary judgment is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Aiken Regional Medical Center is a former defendant in this matter, but is not a party to this appeal.Â  \r\n[3] On this date, Green named the same expert in her supplemental answers as she initially named in July 2004, although she withdrew the expertâ€™s name based on the expertâ€™s alleged inability to provide adequate testimony to support her case.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-117","title":"Father v.

Elliott, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nJames Fletcher Thompson, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\nRichard Giles Whiting, of Columbia, for Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Father appeals the family courtâ€™s order upholding the Doesâ€™ adoption of Child, finding Fatherâ€™s consent to the adoption was not required, and terminating Fatherâ€™s parental rights.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nFather and Mother[2] met in the fall of 2001 at a cub scout meeting for their sons.Â  Thereafter, Mother and Father had a brief romantic relationship wherein they had sexual intercourse on a few different occasions.\r\nIn late November 2001, Mother told Father that she was pregnant.Â  A pregnancy test confirmed Motherâ€™s assertion.Â  Thereafter, Mother informed Father that she wanted to have an abortion.Â  Father, at least in part motivated by his personal beliefs, argued against Mother having an abortion.Â  Nevertheless, Mother insisted on having the abortion and asked Father to assist her financially during this period.Â  Father gave Mother around $250.00.\r\nIn the ensuing weeks, Mother and Fatherâ€™s relationship, which was already strained, completely subsided.Â  Mother embarked on a â€œdrug bingeâ€ in the latter part of December and subsequently entered a rehab program in the Richland County area.Â  In February of 2002, Mother moved to the Shalom House, a halfway house in Anderson County, where she remained through the end of June 2002.Â  During this period, Mother and Father did not see one another.\r\nMother decided to put Child up for adoption and contacted Bethany Christian Services, an adoption agency in Columbia.Â  In June 2002, Mother provided Bethany with a sworn affidavit explaining, in relevant part:\r\n\r\n[Child] of course has a birthfather, unfortunately his identity is unknown to me.Â  During the time (mid-Nov. â€™01) that she was conceived I was drinking and using drugs.Â  I had not had sex in several months before the few days in Nov. that I had sex with at least 3 men over a weekendâ€™s time.Â  \r\n\r\nIn July 2002, she provided Bethany with another affidavit stating she was unsuccessful in her attempts to discover the names of the three men with whom she had sex with in mid-November.Â  Motherâ€™s July affidavit further provides, â€œI feel as if I have exhausted all options of locating the father or knowing who it could be.â€\r\nChild was born on August 11, 2002.Â  Mother then signed a Relinquishment for Adoption, which gave custody of Child to Bethany.Â  On August 16, 2002, Child was placed with her prospective adoptive parents, John and Mary Doe.Â  The Does published a notice of the adoption of Child in January and February of 2003; the notice provided that an action for the adoption of minor child Baby Doe, born to Jane Doe, has been filed.Â  In March 2003, the adoption was concluded and an adoption decree entered.\r\nIn November 2003, Father began to wonder whether Mother ever had an abortion.Â  Father asked Motherâ€™s mother about the abortion, and learned Mother actually gave Child up for adoption.Â  Motherâ€™s mother provided Father with pictures of Child that Father believed looked like him.[3]\r\nFather then investigated the adoption of Child and discovered the Does were her adoptive parents.Â  In late November 2003, Father met with and informed John Doe that Child was Fatherâ€™s biological child.Â  During this initial meeting, Father offered to have a co-parenting relationship of some sort; John Doe refused Fatherâ€™s suggestion.Â  In January 2004, Fatherâ€™s attorney sent the Does a letter again inquiring whether they were willing to have a co-parenting situation and explaining that Father was willing to contribute financially.\r\nIn February 2004, after Father received no response from the Does, he initiated an action to set aside the adoption of Child and grant him sole entitlement to Childâ€™s legal and physical custody.Â  After a hearing, the family court upheld the adoption, found Father was not required to provide consent, terminated Fatherâ€™s parental rights, and held removal of Child from the Does would be against Childâ€™s best interest.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhen reviewing the factual determinations of the family court, an appellate court may take its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â  Where the evidence is disputed, the appellate court may adhere to the findings of the family court, who was in a superior position to judge the witnessesâ€™ demeanor and veracity.Â  Id.Â  However, â€œthe appellate courtâ€™s broad scope of review does not relieve the appellant of the burden of showing that the family court committed error.â€Â  Ex parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 62, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652 (2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFather contends the family court erred in failing to set aside the adoption of Child based on Motherâ€™s alleged extrinsic fraud.Â  Specifically, Father argues Motherâ€™s failure to name Father as a potential father in her affidavit to Bethany deprived Father of the opportunity to participate in the adoption proceeding.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 20-7-1800(B) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) provides that the family court may set aside a decree of adoption on the ground of â€œextrinsic fraud,â€ which is defined as â€œfraud that induces a person not to present a case or deprives a person of the opportunity to be heard.â€Â  \r\nIn Brown v. Malloy, this court analyzed whether a decree of adoption could be set aside where a birthfather alleged birthmother fraudulently precluded his participation in the adoption proceedings.Â  345 S.C. 113, 546 S.E.2d 195 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  In Brown, the birthmother provided the incorrect county of the childâ€™s conception and the birthfatherâ€™s residence which led to publication of the notice of adoption proceedings in a county in which birthfather did not reside.Â  Id. at 116-17, 546 S.E.2d at 196-97.Â  The family court found the birthmotherâ€™s misrepresentations were unintentional and upheld the adoption.Â  Id. at 119, 546 S.E.2d at 198.Â  This court affirmed the family courtâ€™s decision based on our determination that the issue was â€œheavily dependent on credibility.â€Â  Id.Â  Nevertheless, our holding in Brown suggests that extrinsic fraud may result if a birthmother intentionally misrepresents facts that prevent the birthfather from being notified of the possible adoption of child.Â  Id. at 118-19, 546 S.E.2d at 197-98.\r\nIn this case, the record indicates Mother has always believed that Father was not Childâ€™s biological father.Â  Consistent with her affidavit to Bethany, Mother testified that she did not even know she was pregnant when she confronted Father about being pregnant and sought money for an abortion, explaining that she was just trying to get â€œmoney out of a man.â€Â  Similarly, when confronted about failing to give Father a chance to take a DNA test, Mother explained, â€œI didnâ€™t believe he was the father.â€Â  Mother also testified that she did not remember ever having sex with Father without using a condom.Â  Further, after learning Father was contesting the adoption, Mother phoned Father and left a message on his answering machine in which she assured him there was a â€œ99.9 percent guarantee that you are not the father . . . .â€Â  Likewise, in a letter Mother sent to the Does after Father began to contest the adoption, Mother apologized for â€œall that has happened,â€ and explained, â€œI did the best I could and I thought I was doing everything right.â€\r\nWe recognize there is evidence in the record that indicates Mother lied to Father about getting an abortion and Father believed the lie until he learned otherwise in November 2003.Â  We also acknowledge there is testimony from one of Fatherâ€™s friends about a long conversation they had in which Father expressed his deep regrets about the supposed abortion of Child.Â  The friend also testified Father appeared genuinely excited and surprised after learning Child was not aborted.\r\nNevertheless, after a thorough review of the record, we find Father failed to provide clear and convincing proof that Mother committed extrinsic fraud by neglecting to identify him as a possible father.Â  In this case, the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses, found Mother credible and Father not credible.Â  In this instance, we defer to the family courtâ€™s findings because the evidence in the record supports the courtâ€™s holding.Â  Having found that Father failed to prove Mother committed extrinsic fraud, we need not address Fatherâ€™s remaining issues.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (stating the appellate court need not address remaining issues when resolution of prior issue is\r\ndispositive).\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n GOOLSBY and STILWELL, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Â This case is sealed.Â  As such, all names are omitted in order to protect the partiesâ€™ identities.Â  \r\n[3] Â In April 2004, DNA test results confirmed that there was a 99.97% probability Father was Childâ€™s birthfather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-118","title":"State v.

Gaines, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nJ. Leeds Barroll, IV, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: The City of Columbia appeals from the circuit courtâ€™s order affirming the order of the Appellate Panel of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission, which awarded benefits to Charlie Corbin for sustaining a repetitive trauma injury to his back.Â  The City argues that Corbinâ€™s claim should be barred because it was not filed within the two-year statute of limitations period and because Corbin failed to give the City notice within ninety days of the accident.Â  We affirm.[1]  \r\nFACTS\r\nCorbin began working as a nighttime garbage collector for the City of Columbia Sanitation Department in 1994.Â  His truck did not have a â€œclaw,â€ the device which lifts up trash cans automatically, so Corbin and an assistant had to manually lift the trash cans to dump them into the truck.Â  \r\nCorbin experienced back problems, and on February 28, 2002, he visited Dr. Brett Gunter.Â  Dr. Gunter diagnosed Corbin as having lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication.Â  Corbin was out of work until March 4, 2002, and when he returned to work, Dr. Gunter restricted Corbin from lifting more than ten pounds.Â  With that restriction, Corbin was unable to work for the sanitation department because it did not have any light duty positions.Â  Corbin returned to Dr. Gunterâ€™s office seeking a change to his weight lifting restrictions, which he received.Â  \r\nCorbin returned to his employment as a trash collector, and his back pain continued.Â  On October 3, 2002, Corbin ceased his employment with the City due to his injury, and he had surgery on his back later that month.Â  \r\nOn June 9, 2004, Corbin filed a Form 50 with the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission for a work-related, repetitive trauma injury to his back.Â  The City argued Corbinâ€™s claim was barred by the two-year statute of limitations because his injury occurred in February of 2002.Â  The City further argued, inter alia, that Corbin failed to provide the City with notice of his accident within ninety days.Â  The single commissioner disagreed and awarded Corbin benefits.Â  The Appellate Panel adopted the order of the single commissioner, and the circuit court affirmed.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard by which to review decisions from the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  Any review of the Appellate Panelâ€™s factual findings is governed by the substantial evidence standard.Â  Bursey v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 360 S.C. 135, 141, 600 S.E.2d 80, 84 (Ct. App. 2004); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(e) (2005).Â  Accordingly, when confronted with a challenge to a factual determination by the Appellate Panel, this courtâ€™s review is limited to deciding whether the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision is supported by substantial evidence.Â  Rodriguez v. Romero, 363 S.C. 80, 84, 610 S.E.2d 488, 490 (2005).Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, but is evidence that, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the agency reached.â€ Â Pratt v. Morris Roofing, Inc., 357 S.C. 619, 622, 594 S.E.2d 272, 274 (2004).Â  However, where the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision is controlled by an error of law, this courtâ€™s review is plenary.Â  Lizee v. S.C. Dept. of Mental Health, 367 S.C. 122, 126, 623 S.E.2d 860, 862 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe City first argues the circuit court erred in finding Corbinâ€™s claim was timely filed.Â  We disagree.\r\nPursuant to section 42-15-40 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006), a claim for workersâ€™ compensation must be filed within two years of the date of accidental injury.Â Â Â  When the injury results from repetitive trauma, the statute of limitations begins to run from the last day of exposure, which is the last day of work.Â  Schurlknight v. City of North Charleston, 352 S.C. 175, 179, 574 S.E.2d 194, 196 (2002).\r\nIn the case before us, there is substantial evidence to support the Appellate Panelâ€™s determination that Corbinâ€™s injury resulted from repetitive trauma.Â  Dr. Gunter opined that based on his examinations of Corbin and Corbinâ€™s work history, Corbinâ€™s injury was caused by repetitive trauma to the back.Â  Corbin also testified that his every day job duties caused his back problems, explaining that the lifting of boxes and constant climbing into and out of the truck bothered his back.Â  \r\nBecause there is substantial evidence Corbinâ€™s injury resulted from repetitive trauma, his Form 50 needed to be filed within two years of his last day of work to be timely.[2]Â Â  The parties agree Corbinâ€™s last day of work was October 3, 2002, and Corbinâ€™s Form 50 was filed by June 9, 2004, which was within the two year-limitation period.Â  Accordingly, we find no merit to the Cityâ€™s argument that Corbinâ€™s claim should be barred.\r\nNext, the City argues Corbin failed to provide notice within ninety days that his injury was work-related.Â  We disagree, finding substantial evidence in the record to support the Appellate Panelâ€™s finding that notice was timely made.\r\nCorbin testified that in March 2002, he explained the injury and its repetitive trauma nature to his supervisor. Corbinâ€™s supervisor testified that he had â€œconstantâ€ discussion with Corbin about his worsening conditions after this March 2002 discussion.Â  Furthermore, Corbin presented notes from his physician to his employer shortly before he had surgery in October.Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing, we find substantial evidence supports the Appellate Panelâ€™s finding that Corbinâ€™s claim was timely filed and the City was given timely notice.Â  Accordingly, the order of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The City also seems to argue that the date of injury should have been February 28, 2002, when he first saw Dr. Gunter.Â  Although Corbin was out of work for a few days after that visit, it is undisputed he returned to work on March 4 and worked continuously until October 3, 2002.Â  The statute of limitations begins to run the last day of work, not the day the claimant learns an injury is work-related.Â  See White v. Medical University of South Carolina, 355 S.C. 560, 566, 586 S.E.2d 157, 160-61 (Ct. App. 2003) (â€œ[E]ven if substantial evidence supported the commissionâ€™s determination that White knew since 1997 that his back pain was work-related, the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the last day of exposure â€“ Whiteâ€™s last day of work in April of 2000.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-121","title":"State v.

Richardson of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This case is an appeal from a bond estreatment matter involving several defendants.[1]Â  Palmetto Surety Corporation (Palmetto Surety) appeals from orders of the circuit court (1) denying Palmetto Suretyâ€™s motions for relief of judgment and (2) affirming consent orders partially estreating the bonds on defendants Bryan Floyd, Ronald Scott Renwrick, and Boris V. Ojasoo. Â We affirm.[2]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn September and October 2003, Priscilla Spivey signed appearance recognizance bonds as surety on behalf of the above named defendants.Â  Each bond noted the name of the surety company as Beach Bonding Company, and attached Powers of Attorney from Palmetto Surety appointing â€œthe below named agent,â€ Spivey, as Palmetto Suretyâ€™s attorney-in-fact to execute and deliver on itâ€™s behalf, as surety, a bail bond.Â  All three of the defendants failed to appear in court as required and Notices of Forfeited Recognizance were filed in the Clerk of Courtâ€™s office on February 24, 2004 as to each defendant.Â  A bond estreatment hearing was scheduled regarding all three defendants for April 5, 2004.Â  However, in lieu of a hearing, the parties reached a settlement and on April 16, 2004, entered into consent orders, estreating $4,500 on each defendantâ€™s bond.Â  Each of the consent orders was signed by Spivey, as representative for Beach Bonding Company and for Palmetto Surety.Â  \r\nOn December 9, 2004, Palmetto Surety filed a motion for relief of judgment pursuant to Rule 60, SCRCP asserting, among other things, that Palmetto Surety had not been properly notified of the bond estreatment hearing, that the bond itself was not properly signed so as to bind Palmetto Surety, and Palmetto Surety did not authorize the signing of the consent order.Â  A hearing was held on the motion on January 5, 2006.Â  At that time, Palmetto Surety argued (1) that it did not authorize the signing of the consent orders; (2) that it did not â€œowe the money to begin withâ€ because Spivey did not sign the bonds themselves as an agent for Palmetto Surety and the attached Powers of Attorney were merely exhibits that failed to indicate Palmetto Surety accepted the underwriting of the bonds; and (3) the notices of recognizance sent to Palmetto Surety were insufficient to put Palmetto Surety on notice that it had reason to attend the bond estreatment hearing.Â  The State countered, if the court found notices of the bond estreatment hearings were proper, Palmetto Surety should have appeared at that time to argue there was no agency relationship to bind Palmetto Surety and, having failed to appear, Palmetto Surety waived the issue.Â  The State further argued that there was an existing express agency relationship between Beach Bonding and Palmetto Surety and Palmetto Surety was required to file paperwork with the clerk of court to relieve it of that relationship with Beach Bonding.\r\nThe trial court orally ruled that the records filed with the clerk of court and documentation provided by the State indicated that proper notice was given to Palmetto Surety, that no representative appeared on its behalf to argue against Spiveyâ€™s authority or the bond forfeiture request, and Palmetto Surety therefore waived any arguments regarding Spiveyâ€™s authority when it failed to appear and present evidence at the hearing.Â  The court additionally found that Spivey did have authority to bind Palmetto Surety as she had an established business relationship representing Palmetto Surety in these matters, and that documentation had been filed with the clerk of court indicating, at that time, Spivey had authority to write bonds that were backed by Palmetto Surety, and there had been no filing with the clerk of court that withdrew that authority.Â  The trial court also found Palmetto Surety had given Spivey Powers of Attorney documentation thereby establishing an apparent agency such that Spivey had the authority to enter into the consent orders.Â  By written order dated January 17, 2006, the trial court held that notice of the April 5, 2004 bond estreatment hearings was proper as to both Beach Bonding and Palmetto Surety, as the notices were sent by certified return receipt mail to each party, and because any agency argument should have been made at that hearing, such argument was deemed waived.Â  The court further held, assuming arguendo that the agency argument was properly raised at the motion for relief of judgment hearing, an agency relationship between the bondsman and Palmetto Surety did exist at the time and that the Powers of Attorney and bonds were properly executed so as to bind the bondsman and Palmetto Surety.Â  Accordingly, the court determined the motions for relief of judgment should be denied, and it affirmed the estreatment of $4,500 as to each defendant's bond.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhether to grant or deny a motion under Rule 60(b)[3] lies within the sound discretion of the judge.Â  BB &amp; T v. Taylor, 369 S.C. 548, 551, 633 S.E.2d 501, 502 (2006).Â  This courtâ€™s standard of review is therefore limited to determining whether the trial court committed an abuse of discretion.Â  Id. at 551, 633 S.E.2d at 502-03.Â  An abuse of discretion arises where the trial courtâ€™s ruling is controlled by an error of law or where it is based on factual conclusions that are without evidentiary support.Â  Id. at 551, 633 S.E.2d at 503.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPalmetto Surety couches its appeal as to each of the defendantsâ€™ bonds in a single issue, asserting that the trial court â€œerred in estreating [each of the defendantsâ€™] bond[s] and in requiring Palmetto Surety Corporation to be responsible for same where [Palmetto Surety was] not a party properly noted on the notice of forfeiture recognizance nor [was Palmetto Surety] properly noted on the bond instrument itself and [Palmetto Surety] was not subject to the consent order signed by Priscilla Spivey.â€Â  It argues that the notices of recognizance failed to include Palmetto Surety in the caption of the notices, as well as on the face of the notices indicating the parties to whom they were addressed.Â  Palmetto Surety further maintains that Spivey signed the bonds only as surety for Beach Bonding, and the attached Powers of Attorney reveal her authority was limited as they appointed her only to execute the bond, and specified Spivey was not authorized to act as agent for receipt of service of process.Â  Palmetto Surety contends, because it was not â€œsummonedâ€ as required by statute, the notice mailed to it was insufficient to bind it.Â Â  Â \r\nThe trial court based its ruling on two alternative grounds: (1) that Palmetto Surety received notice of the bond estreatment hearings in these matters and therefore waived any issue as to the existence of an agency relationship when it failed to appear and argue the issue at the bond estreatment hearings and (2) even if the agency argument was properly raised in the motion for relief hearing, an agency relationship did in fact exist so as to bind Palmetto Surety.Â  The trial courtâ€™s oral ruling found that Spivey had authority to bind Palmetto Surety based on her established business relationship representing Palmetto Surety in these matters, as well as the existence of documentation that had been filed with the clerk of court indicating she had authority to write bonds that were backed by Palmetto Surety but for which there was no subsequent filing with the clerk of court to withdraw that authority.Â  The trial court also determined Palmetto Surety had given Spivey Powers of Attorney documentation establishing an apparent agency.Â  Accordingly, the court held Spivey had the authority to enter into the consent orders.Â  \r\nWe hold Palmetto Surety has failed to challenge the trial courtâ€™s alternative finding on the existence of an agency relationship.Â  In its brief, Palmetto Surety asserts that it was not subject to the consent orders signed by Spivey.Â  It does so, however, in a conclusory manner and does not specifically challenge the trial courtâ€™s finding that an agency relationship existed between the bondsman and Palmetto Surety which acted to bind Palmetto Surety.Â  Houck v. State Farm Fire and Cas. Ins. Co., 366 S.C. 7, 17 n. 5, 620 S.E.2d 326, 332 n. 5 (2005) (noting an issue is abandoned if the appellantâ€™s brief treats it in a conclusory manner).Â  \r\nThe closest Palmetto Surety comes to arguing against an agency relationship appears to be its assertion that the Powers of Attorney did not authorize Spivey to sign the consent orders on its behalf.Â  The thrust of Palmetto Suretyâ€™s argument as to agency in this regard is that, because Spivey signed the bond instruments themselves only as surety for Beach Bonding and not Palmetto Surety, and because the Powers of Attorney attached to the bonds revealed the authority of Spivey is â€œlimited to appearance bond . . . .[and Spivey]Â  is appointed only to execute the bondâ€ consistent with that power, â€œthe power did not authorizeÂ  . . . anything beyond signing the bond itself,â€ thereby rendering the consent orders ineffective to bind Palmetto Surety.Â  (emphasis in original)Â  Palmetto does not, however, challenge the trial courtâ€™s findings of an agency relationship based on the established relationship between the bondsman and Palmetto Surety, nor on the documentation of that relationship filed with the clerk of court along with the lack of any filing regarding the withdrawal of that agency relationship.Â  Thus, even if we were to find Palmetto Suretyâ€™s argument sufficient to challenge the courtâ€™s finding of apparent authority based on the Powers of Attorney, Palmetto Surety has failed to argue against the trial courtâ€™s determination that an agency relationship existed as a result of the established relationship between Spivey and Palmetto Surety, as well as its finding of agency based on the documents filed with the clerk of court.Â  Further, the argument Palmetto Surety raises on appeal regarding the limited authority accorded Spivey by the Powers of Attorney was never argued below.[4] Â Because Palmetto Surety did not argue to the trail court that Spiveyâ€™s authority was limited by the Powers of Attorney, this argument is not preserved for our review.Â  Taylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 216, 479 S.E.2d 35, 43 (1996) (noting an issue not raised in the trial court will not be considered on appeal;Â  an issue is not preserved if a party argues one ground for objection at trial and another ground on appeal).Â  \r\nAs there is no other argument made by Palmetto to challenge the trial courtâ€™s ruling on the agency relationship, this finding by the trial court is affirmed.Â  South Carolina Tax Commâ€™n v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp., 316 S.C. 163, 170, 447 S.E.2d 843, 847 (1994) (holding an appellate court will affirm where an appellant fails to appeal the alternative ground of a trial courtâ€™s ruling);Â  Biales v. Young, 315 S.C. 166, 168, 432 S.E.2d 482, 484 (1993) (holding the failure to challenge an alternative ground for a holding constitutes abandonment of the issue and precludes consideration on appeal).Â  Because we affirm the trial courtâ€™s ruling on the agency issue, we need not address Palmetto Suretyâ€™s argument regarding notice of the bond estreatment hearing.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not address remaining issues when disposition of a prior issue is dispositive.).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn conclusion, we hold Palmetto Surety failed to challenge the trial courtâ€™s ruling that an agency relationship did in fact exist such that Spivey had authority to bind Palmetto Surety.Â  Because Palmetto Surety failed to challenge this alternative ground, the orders below are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Because these matters were heard at the same time, in the same hearing, resulting in the same transcript, and involve the same issues, we have consolidated these cases on appeal.Â  See Rule 214, SCACR (â€œWhere there is more than one appeal from the same order, judgment, decision or decree, or where the same question is involved in two or more appeals in different cases, the appellate court may, in its discretion, order the appeal to be consolidated.â€).\r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3] While Palmetto Surety did not specify whether it was moving from relief of judgment under Rule 60(a) or (b), SCRCP, it is clear Palmetto Surety never asserted there was any clerical mistake that would entitle it to relief under Rule 60(a).Â  We therefore treat the motions as having been brought pursuant to Rule 60 (b), SCRCP, which provides relief of final judgment for the following reasons:Â  (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;Â  (2) newly discovered evidence;Â  (3) fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is void;Â  (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or is based upon a prior judgment which has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.\r\n[4] Before the trial court, Palmetto Surety only argued it was never liable on the bonds themselves because Spivey failed to sign on behalf of Palmetto Surety on the face of the bonds, an issue it does not continue to maintain on appeal.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-122","title":"Leonard v.

Smith, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Â J. Kennedy DuBose, Jr. and Jonathan M. Robinson, of Camden, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Delores Leonard, a former part-time magistrate for Kershaw County, appeals the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal of her action for unpaid wages pursuant to the Magistratesâ€™ Pay Act.[1]Â  We affirm.[2]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1996, Leonard began working as a part-time magistrate for Kershaw County, and she continued in this capacity until her resignation in April 2003. As a magistrate, Leonard worked twenty hours a week and was â€œon-callâ€ seventy-nine hours per week.Â  Leonard wrote to the chief magistrate on September 15, 2000, requesting compensation for her â€œon-callâ€ hours.Â  This letter from Leonard was followed by a letter to the Kershaw County Administrator from Leonardâ€™s attorney, inquiring about Leonardâ€™s claim for â€œon-callâ€ hoursâ€™ compensation.Â  The Countyâ€™s attorney responded by letter on January 22, 2003, explaining that after discussing the matter with the County Administrator and Chief Magistrate â€œit has been determined that Magistrate Delores D. Leonard is being appropriately compensated.â€ \r\nIn February 2003, Leonard filed an action for unpaid wages pursuant to the Payment of Wages Act,[3] alleging that the County failed to pay her for the time she spent â€œon-call.â€Â  The County filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted.Â  A panel of our court affirmed the dismissal, finding Leonard should have filed her claim pursuant to the Magistratesâ€™ Compensation Act because it provided the exclusive remedy for magistrates with disputes over wages.Â  Leonard v. Kershaw County, 2005-UP-164 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nOn July 15, 2004, while her case seeking relief pursuant to the Payment of Wages Act was pending, Leonard filed an action for unpaid wages pursuant to the Magistratesâ€™ Pay Act.Â  The County again moved to dismiss the case, arguing Leonard failed to file for judicial review within thirty days of the Countyâ€™s final decision pursuant to section 1-23-380 of the South Carolina Code.[4]Â  Leonard argued that the thirty-day period for judicial review had not yet begun because section 22-8-50(B) of the South Carolina Code requires that there first be a formal hearing.Â  \r\nAfter a hearing on the matter, the circuit court found the January 22, 2003 letter from the Countyâ€™s attorney denying Leonard additional compensation was the final decision of the County.Â  Because Leonard failed to request judicial review within thirty days of that letter, the circuit court granted the Countyâ€™s motion to dismiss.Â  \r\nLeonard filed a Rule 59(e) motion, arguing the circuit court failed to rule on whether Leonard received a hearing pursuant to section 22-8-50(B) of the South Carolina Code.Â  The circuit court denied the motion to reconsider.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nLeonard argues she is entitled to a hearing pursuant to section 22-8-50(B) of the South Carolina Code, and because she has not been afforded this hearing, the circuit court erred in dismissing her action as untimely.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 1-23-380 of the South Carolina Code requires that review of the Countyâ€™s decision be â€œinstituted by serving and filing notice of appeal . . . within thirty days after the final decision of the agency . . . .â€Â  The thirty day timeline is triggered, not by when or whether a hearing was held, but by the issuance of a final decision.Â  \r\nIn Cox v. County of Florence, 337 S.C. 340, 523 S.E.2d 776 (1999), three part-time magistrates sued Florence County for wages they claimed to have earned while working extra hours.Â  Florence County denied the magistrates relief in a letter.Â  Id. at 344, 523 S.E.2d at 778.Â  On appeal, our supreme court found this letter, which provided the magistrates with written notice of Florence Countyâ€™s decision, triggered the thirty-day period during which the magistrates could seek judicial review of Florence Countyâ€™s decision.Â  Id.\r\nHere, Leonard received written notice of the Countyâ€™s decision in January 2003. She did not file this action until July 2004, well outside the thirty-day window for seeking judicial review.Â  Accordingly, the order of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] South Carolina Code Â§ 22-8-10, et seq.\r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3] South Carolina Code Â§ 41-10-10, et seq.\r\n[4] This code section is part of the South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-123","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Edgar Lewis Clements, III, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Roger Platt appeals his convictions for armed robbery and possession of a weapon during a crime of violence, arguing the trial court erred by refusing to suppress the victimâ€™s identification of him.Â  Specifically, Platt argues the show-up identification was unreliable under the totality of the circumstances.Â  We affirm.[1] \r\nFACTS\r\nAt 9:30 p.m. on March 9, 2004, Ryan Brown was pumping gas at a service station in Florence County when he was approached by a man who asked, â€œYo, man, you want some green?â€ Ryan declined the offer and drove away to his friend Jimmy Brownâ€™s house.Â  \r\nAfter arriving at Jimmyâ€™s house, Ryan invited Jimmy out to his car to see the new TV he had purchased.Â  When both Ryan and Jimmy were in Ryanâ€™s car, Ryan stepped outside to take a phone call.Â  Suddenly, the man who had approached him at the gas station appeared, took Ryanâ€™s phone, grabbed Ryan by the collar, and announced that Ryan was coming with him.Â  Ryan pushed the man away and ran to the safety of Jimmyâ€™s home where he asked someone inside to call the police.Â  Jimmy, meanwhile, locked himself in the car to remain out of harmâ€™s way.Â  \r\nThe police arrived shortly.Â  Ryan described his assailant as a black male who was approximately five foot seven inches tall and between 160 and 170 pounds, wearing blue jeans, a blue shirt with a stripe on it, and a gray toboggan or bandana.Â  Ryan and Jimmy drove around the area with police, and Ryan recognized a car on the side of the road as the one he had seen his assailant exit at the service station.Â  However, neither Ryan nor Jimmy could identify the man standing next to the vehicle.Â  As the victims continued to ride with police, Ryan recognized his assailant walking down the side of the road, but by the time the police cruiser turned around, the man was gone.Â Â  \r\nThe police set up a perimeter, and Platt was found hiding in the bushes with Ryanâ€™s cell phone within a few feet of him.Â  Both Ryan and Jimmy identified Platt as the perpetrator, and according to the officer with whom they spoke, both men were one hundred percent certain of the identification. When Platt was booked, he reported being five feet eight inches tall and 180 pounds.Â  He was wearing a black shirt with a stripe on it and a toboggan.Â  Platt also had little braids in his hair, which the victims never reported to the police and which the trial court opined were major physical identifying marks of Platt.Â  \r\nPrior to trial, Platt made a motion to suppress both Ryanâ€™s and Jimmyâ€™s identification of him.Â  The trial court suppressed Jimmyâ€™s identification, finding his view of the assailant was obscured because he observed the assailant through the rearview mirror and through the carâ€™s heavily tinted windows. However, the trial court refused to suppress Ryanâ€™s identification, finding that although the show-up identification was unduly suggestive it was nonetheless reliable under the totality of the circumstances.Â  Despite the trial courtâ€™s concern regarding Ryanâ€™s failure to mention Plattâ€™s braids to police, the court ultimately concluded it would be for the jury to conclude how much weight to give the identification based on that discrepancy.Â  \r\nThe jury found Platt guilty of armed robbery and possession of a weapon during a crime of violence.Â  The trial court sentenced Platt to concurrent twenty-year terms in prison.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.â€ Â State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  A trial courtâ€™s decision to admit an eyewitnessâ€™s identification is discretionary and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion or the commission of prejudicial legal error.Â  State v. Brown, 356 S.C. 496, 502, 589 S.E.2d 781, 784 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPlatt argues the trial court should have suppressed Ryanâ€™s identification because it was unduly suggestive and unreliable.Â  While we agree the show-up procedure was unduly suggestive, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion by concluding the identification was reliable under the totality of the circumstances.Â  \r\nTo determine whether an out-of-court identification is admissible, South Carolina employs the two-prong inquiry developed by the United States Supreme Court in Neil v. Biggers,Â  409 U.S. 188, 199-201 (1972).Â  The first prong considers whether the identification process was unduly suggestive.Â  State v. Brown, 356 S.C. 496, 503, 589 S.E.2d 781, 784 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  If the identification procedure is deemed suggestive, we then consider the second prong of the analysis: whether a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification occurred.Â  State v. Moore, 343 S.C. 282, 287, 540 S.E.2d 445, 447-48 (2000).Â  â€œAlthough one-on-one show ups have been sharply criticized, and are inherently suggestive, the identification need not be excluded as long as under the circumstances the identification was reliableâ€ despite the suggestive procedure.Â  Id. at 287, 540 S.E.2d at 448 (finding show-up procedure unduly suggestive where witness was brought to a location where two individuals wearing similar clothing to that described by the witness were surrounded by uniformed police).Â  Therefore, the overarching inquiry is whether under the totality of circumstances a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification exists.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe trial court found the show-up procedure employed by police in this case was unduly suggestive, and the State does not appeal from that ruling.Â  Thus, our only inquiry is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the identification was reliable and the opportunity for misidentification was slight.Â  The factors to be considered in evaluating the likelihood of misidentification include the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witnessâ€™s degree of attention, the accuracy of the witnessâ€™s prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty displayed by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of time between the crime and the confrontation.Â  State v. Blassingame, 338 S.C. 240, 252, 525 S.E.2d 535, 541 (Ct. App. 1999) (citations omitted).Â  \r\nApplying these factors to the present case, we find Ryanâ€™s identification testimony reliable.Â  Ryan had the opportunity to observe his assailant on two occasions:Â  once under the fluorescent lights of the service station when the assailant was ten feet away, and once in the well-lit area around Jimmyâ€™s driveway when the assailant was an armâ€™s length away.Â  As for the degree of Ryanâ€™s attention, he testified that he was in fear for his life because Platt had a gun pointed at him.Â  â€œ[A] person in fear of his life presumably has a more acute degree of attention to his surroundings than a mere passerby.â€ State v. Johnson, 318 S.C. 372, 375, 458 S.E.2d 49, 51 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  Furthermore, Ryan was absolutely certain of his identification, which occurred the same evening of the robbery and within a short distance from the scene of the crime.Â  Although Ryan failed to mention the assailantâ€™s braids to the police, his description was otherwise remarkably accurate.Â  The discrepancy regarding Plattâ€™s hair is not enough to overturn the trial courtâ€™s ruling regarding reliability.Â  See State v. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 79-80, 538 S.E.2d 257, 264 (Ct. App. 2000) (finding witnessâ€™s description of defendant accurate as a whole despite witnessâ€™s memory that the defendant had an Afro and wore boots when actually the defendantâ€™s hair was in plaits and he wore tennis shoes).\r\nViewing the totality of the circumstances, we find no error in the admission of Ryanâ€™s identification.Â  Accordingly, Plattâ€™s convictions are\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY and STILWELL, JJ., concur\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-124","title":"State v.

Markley Dennis, Jr., Circuit Court Judge \r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-124\r\nSubmitted March 1, 2007 â€“ Filed March 15, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Joseph L.

Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia, and Solicitor Ralph E. Hoisington, of Charleston,Â  for Respondent.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPer curiam:Â  Ishama M. Nelson appeals his conviction for armed robbery, contending the trial judge erred in not allowing Nelsonâ€™s counsel to argue in closing that â€œ[t]his defendantâ€™s life is at stake.â€Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFacts\r\nNelson and Franklin Wright, armed with handguns, robbed an Exxon station in Goose Creek on February 23, 2003.Â  Wright pled guilty to the lesser offense of strong-armed robbery in consideration for testifying against Nelson.Â  \r\nDuring his closing argument, Nelsonâ€™s counsel began the statement â€œThis defendantâ€™s life--.â€Â  The State immediately objected, contending Nelsonâ€™s counsel was â€œcommenting on sentencing.â€Â  The trial judge cautioned Nelsonâ€™s counsel but allowed him to proceed.Â  Nelsonâ€™s counsel then stated, â€œThis defendantâ€™s life is at stake.â€Â  The trial judge immediately ruled the argument was improper.Â  Counsel for Nelson stated â€œAll right.Â  All right.â€Â  The judge instructed the jury to disregard the statement. Â Â \r\nNelson was found guilty of armed robbery and sentenced to imprisonment for eighteen years. \r\nStandard of Review\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only. Â State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 625 S.E.2d 216 (2006); State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 520, 608 S.E.2d 435 (Ct. App. 2004); State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 575 S.E.2d 852 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  On appeal, we are limited to determining whether the trial judge abused his discretion. Â State v. Reed, 332 S.C. 35, 503 S.E.2d 747 (1998); State v. Walker, 366 S.C. 643, 623 S.E.2d 122 (Ct. App. 2005); State v. Bowie, 360 S.C. 210, 600 S.E.2d 112 (Ct. App. 2004). Â In order for an error of law to warrant reversal, the error must result in prejudice to the appellant. Â State v. Patterson, 367 S.C. 219, 625 S.E.2d 239 (Ct. App. 2006); see State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 536 S.E.2d 679 (2000); State v. Wyatt, 317 S.C. 370, 453 S.E.2d 890 (1995).\r\nDiscussion\r\nNelson argues his statement was entirely proper because it served to impress upon the jurors the gravity of their decision.Â  This argument was not raised to and ruled on by the trial judge and is not preserved for our review.Â  State v. Williams, 303 S.C. 410, 401 S.E.2d 168 (1991) (issues not raised to and ruled on by the trial judge are not preserved for appeal); State v. Newton, 274 S.C. 287, 262 S.E.2d 906 (1980) (questions neither presented to nor passed upon by the trial judge are waived and should not be considered by the appellate court for the first time on appeal). Â The record of the case shows that Nelsonâ€™s counsel only argued sentencing, and the State objected on that the ground.Â  The trial judge sustained the Stateâ€™s objection. \r\nEven if Nelsonâ€™s contention were preserved for appellate review, it fails on the merits.Â  The trial judge is vested with broad discretion in dealing with the scope of closing arguments, and ordinarily the judgeâ€™s rulings on such matters will not be disturbed. Â State v. Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 482 S.E.2d 760 (1997).Â  The jury is concerned only with determining guilt, and a closing argument about sentencing and punishment is improper. Â State v.

Hudgins, of Columbia, for Appellant.Â  \r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General Shawn L. Reeves, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Jerry W. Peace, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Michael M. Walker appeals his convictions of two counts of assault of a high and aggravated nature, two counts of pointing and presenting a firearm, and one count of possession of a handgun by a person convicted of a violent crime.Â  We affirm.[1] \r\nFACTS\r\nWalker dated Danny Brownâ€™s sister.Â  When Brown learned of a physical altercation between his sister and Walker, Brown and his cousin, Christopher McKinney, drove around searching for Walker.Â  When they found Walker walking down the road, Brown exited the car and approached him.Â  Walker pulled a handgun on Brown and fired it.Â  Brown ran. Â Walker then approached the car, banged the gun on the car window, opened the car door, and fired the gun into the car. Â \r\nAt a pre-trial hearing, Walker moved to relieve his counsel and proceed pro se.Â  At a second pre-trial hearing, Walker reaffirmed his wish to represent himself. Â The solicitor informed the trial judge that Walker had represented himself in a prior criminal trial.Â  The judge asked Walker if he heard the explanation of the dangers of self-representation the judge made to another defendant that morning.Â  Walker acknowledged he listened to the explanation.Â  Walker then explained he wanted the trial to proceed because he had already been incarcerated for almost a year.Â  The judge generally cautioned Walker about representing himself.Â  Walker reiterated his demand to represent himself. Â Trial commenced the following week.Â  Walkerâ€™s appeal raises three issues.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  Self-Representation\r\nWalker argues the trial judge erred in permitting him to proceed pro se without obtaining a valid waiver of the right to counsel.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œIt is well-established that an accused may waive the right to counsel and proceed pro se.â€Â  State v. Brewer, 328 S.C. 117, 119, 492 S.E.2d 97, 98 (1997).Â  To establish a valid waiver of counsel, the defendant must be adequately warned of the dangers of self-representation.Â  Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 835 (1975).Â  â€œIn the absence of a specific inquiry by the trial judge addressing the disadvantages of proceeding pro se, this Court will look to the record to determine whether petitioner had sufficient background or was apprised of his rights by some other source.â€Â  Bridwell v. State, 306 S.C. 518, 519, 413 S.E.2d 30, 31 (1992).Â  The ultimate test is not the trial judgeâ€™s advice, but the defendantâ€™s understanding.Â  Brewer, 328 S.C. at 119, 492 S.E.2d at 98.\r\nIn this case, the record reflects Walker was emphatic about representing himself.Â  Furthermore, he acknowledged listening to the trial judge explain the dangers of self-representation to another defendant.Â  Walker also had an understanding of the legal system and his legal rights due to his self-representation in a previous criminal trial.Â  Finally, the trial judge addressed the danger of self-representation in a general sense.Â  Upon a review of the record, we find Walkerâ€™s waiver of counsel was knowing and voluntary and although the trial judge did not specifically address the disadvantages of self-representation directly to Walker, Walker made a valid waiver.Â  \r\nII.Â  Error Preservation\r\nWalkerâ€™s remaining issues on appeal are not preserved for appellate review.Â  Walker argues the trial judge erred in not directing a verdict on the charge of possession of a handgun by a person convicted of a crime of violence.Â  Walker failed to move for a directed verdict on this issue at trial.Â  Walker also argues the trial judge erred in instructing the jury that the burden of proving self-defense is on the defendant.Â  Walker failed to object to the erroneous instruction.Â  Issues may not be raised for the first time on appeal but must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.Â  State v. Rogers, 361 S.C. 178, 183, 603 S.E.2d 910, 912-13 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-126","title":"Grant v.

Oâ€™Kelley, Jr., of Beaufort, Â for Appellants.\r\n        Horace Anderson Jones, Jr., of Rock Hill, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is an action in equity to quiet and confirm title[1] in the respondents Ethel Grant[2] and Betty Grant Williams to three parcels of land in Beaufort County and for a partition of that land (hereafter â€œsubject propertyâ€).Â  The heirs of Oliver Seabrook, Sr., appeal. Â They contend the trial judge erroneously found a 1974 action to clear title voided a prior 1974 deed into Oliver Seabrook.Â  The respondents filed no brief.[3]Â  We affirm.[4]\r\nMarch Seabrook, Jr., and his second wife had one child, Janie Bolden Seabrook Ackerman.Â  He and his first wife, however, had seven children, among them being Oliver Seabrook, Ethel Seabrook Grant, and Florence Seabrook Shadrick.[5] Â By a deed dated August 13, 1974, and recorded on August 26, 1974, Ethel Seabrook Grant and Florence Seabrook Shadrick conveyed their interest in the subject property to their brother, Oliver Seabrook, for a nominal consideration.\r\nSome months later, the circuit court entered an order in an action brought by Janie Bolden Seabrook Ackerman against the heirs and distributees of March Seabrook.[6]Â  This order, which is dated December 18, 1974, partitioned certain property, which the trial judgeâ€™s order describes as â€œproperty of the heirs of March Seabrook,â€ between and among Janie Bolden Seabrook Ackerman and March Seabrookâ€™s other heirs, with each receiving separate tracts. Â The order, which no one apparently appealed, found title to the property at issue in the Ackerman action was vested in the following individuals: Florence Shadrick, Ethel Grant, Oliver Seabrook, and the children of Cecelia Seabrook Moultrie, James Moultrie, Angenell Moultrie, Sara Moultrie, and Martha Moultrie. Â Nowhere in the order is there any mention of a deed by which Oliver Seabrookâ€™s sisters conveyed to him their interests in the subject property.\r\nHere, the trial judge viewed the principal issue before him to be the effect of the judgment in the Ackerman action, a judgment filed after the date of the quit claim deed by which Florence Shadrick and Ethel Grant conveyed their interests in the subject property to their brother.Â  The two sisters would have no interest in the subject property if the judgment entered in the Ackerman case did not void Oliver Seabrookâ€™s previously recorded deed; however, the trial judge viewed the judgment, and not the deed, as controlling.\r\nThe trial judge reached this conclusion because he was not â€œable to reconstruct the events surrounding the family membersâ€™ actions from 1974â€ and because the judgment entered in the Ackerman case bound all parties and settled their interests in the subject property.[7]\r\nThe Seabrook heirs make no contention that the judgment rendered in the 1974 quiet title action is not regular on its face.Â  Rather, they contend that judgment did not void the earlier deed that conveyed to Seabrook the interests of his two sisters because the court lacked jurisdiction over one of the parties, namely, Oliver Seabrook.[8]\r\nWhen a court of competent jurisdiction renders a judgment, as did the one here, that appears regular on its face, there is a presumption that the court has jurisdiction of both the subject matter of the action and of the parties and that the court acquired its jurisdiction regularly and exercised its jurisdiction lawfully.[9]Â  â€œThe presumptions in favor of the regularity and validity of a judgment become stronger with the lapse of years.â€[10]Â  These presumptions apply â€œwhenever a judgment is involved in the trial of another case.â€[11]Â  To overcome these presumptions, the party who attacks the judgment must offer â€œaffirmative proof to the contraryâ€;[12] and this proof must establish â€œthe invalidity of the judgment by competent and convincing proof.â€[13]\r\nHere, more than thirty-two years have come and gone since the court entered the judgment at issue in the 1974 quiet title action.[14]Â  Although the Seabrook heirs argue that â€œthere is no evidence that Oliver Seabrook was actually served in the 1974 quiet title action,â€ they put forward no evidence that he was not so served, either personally or by publication.Â  They simply point to the transcript of testimony that does not show Seabrook â€œin attendance at the 197[4] hearing[]â€ and that shows nothing being said about the quit claim deed by either of the two sisters who did attend the hearing and who both testified.\r\nBut whether Seabrook actually attended the hearing or not (as opposed to his testifying) is a matter we can only guess at, as is the matter concerning why the two sisters did not testify about the quit claim deed they had executed months before.Â  Regarding whether Seabrook was personally served with the summons and complaint in the quiet title action, even the Seabrook heirs acknowledge in their brief that â€œ[i]t is not clear if [he] was personally served.â€Â  Suffice it to say, they did not carry their burden of proving the court, in 1974, lacked jurisdiction of both the subject matter and of the parties; therefore, the 1974 judgment, and not the 1974 deed, controls.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Bryan v. Freeman, 253 S.C. 50, 52, 168 S.E.2d 793, 793 (1969).\r\n[2] Â Ethel Grant is now deceased, having died in 2004.\r\n[3] Â Their failure to file a brief allows us, if we want, to reverse the judgment below. Â See Rule 208(a)(4), SCACR; Turner v. Santee Cement Carriers, Inc., 277 S.C. 91, 96, 282 S.E.2d 858, 860 (1981); Robinson v. Hassiotis, 364 S.C. 92, 93 n.2, 610 S.E.2d 858, 859 n.2 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\n[4] Â We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[5] Â Oliver Seabrook and Florence Shadrick are also deceased, having died in 1981 and 1998, respectively.\r\n[6] Â The transcript in that case shows Florence Shadrick and Ethel Grant participated in the hearings.Â  Although named as a party to that action, the record before us does not show whether Oliver Seabrook participated.Â  It also does not show whether he was served.\r\n[7]Â  The trial judge also pointed to another action also filed by Ackerman.Â  That action, which Ackerman commenced in 1989 against H.B. Attaway, Jr., and Dorothy L. Attaway, alleged Ackerman and the heirs of March Seabrook, Sr., had an interest in property claimed by the Attaways.Â  A consent order, dated December 21, 1990, ended the action and expressly recognized that Ethel Grant, Florence Seabrook, and Oliver Seabrook each held an interest in the Attaway property.Â  Like the other action brought by Ackerman, there was no mention of a deed to Oliver Seabrook from his sisters.Â  Moreover, the courtâ€™s order sets out the heirsâ€™ respective interests in that action, as the trial judge in this case observed, â€œas if no such deed was ever executed.â€Â  Larry Seabrook, Oliver Seabrookâ€™s son, testified, however, that his father died in 1981.Â  He also denied ever being served in the second Ackerman action.Â  The file therein contained the final order and an affidavit of publication, but no order of publication; who was served with what and how cannot now be determined. Â The trial judge, however, found he did not need to resolve the factual dispute regarding whether Larry Seabrook was ever served in the second Ackerman action because he found Oliver Seabrook and his heirs were bound by the judgment in the first action and without reference to the deed.\r\n[8]Â  See Turner v. Malone, 24 S.C. 398, 401-02 (1885) (â€œ[J]udicial proceedings are void, when the court, in which they are taken, is acting without jurisdiction . . . . If the jurisdictional defect appears in the record itself . . . the judgment may be disregarded as a nullity whenever and wherever it is encountered, in any proceeding direct or collateral . . . .â€).\r\n[9]Â  Gregoire v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Sr., Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., Office of the Attorney General, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Barbara R. Morgan, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: A jury found Titonton Belfort guilty and sentenced him to nine years imprisonment for trafficking cocaine.Â  Belfort contends the trial judge should have appointed an interpreter pursuant to Section 17-1-50 (2003) of the South Carolina Code.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nBelfort is a native of Haiti and speaks Creole.Â  He immigrated to the United States in 1981 and has never received formal education in Haiti or in the United States.Â  A grand jury in Aiken County indicted Belfort for trafficking cocaine.Â  Subsequently, a jury found Belfort guilty.Â  Pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), counsel for Belfort attached to the final brief a petition to be relieved as counsel, stating she reviewed the record and concluded the appeal was without legal merit sufficient to warrant a new trial.Â  After a thorough review of the record, we ordered the parties to brief whether the circuit court erred in failing to comply with Section 17-1-50 (2003) of the South Carolina Code and whether this issue was preserved for appeal.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBelfort argues the trial judge failed to conform to section 17-1-50.Â  Section 17-1-50(B)(1) provides:\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, whenever a party, witness, or victim in a criminal legal proceeding does not sufficiently understand or speak the English language to comprehend the proceeding or to testify, the court must appoint a certified or otherwise qualified interpreter to interpret the proceedings to the party or victim or to interpret the testimony of the witness.\r\n\r\nWe do not address the issue of whether the trial judge fulfilled the obligations of this section because the issue is not preserved for our review. \r\nâ€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998).Â  It is uncontested that defense trial counsel did not raise the issue of whether the trial court was required to order an interpreter.[1] \r\nNonetheless, Belfort argues that under State v. Blair, 275 S.C. 529, 273 S.E.2d 536 (1981), we can adjudicate this issue even though it is not preserved.Â  However, counselâ€™s reliance on Blair is misplaced.Â  \r\nIn Blair, the South Carolina Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether a defendantâ€™s failure to request a competency hearing, when the defendantâ€™s sanity was a crucial issue throughout the trial, constituted a waiver.Â  Id. at 532, 273 S.E.2d at 537.Â  Our Supreme Court concluded defendantâ€™s failure to request a hearing did not constitute a waiver because of the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S. 375 (1966).Â  Id. Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn Pate, the accused did not demand a sanity hearing, even though the hearing was provided by Illinois law.[2]Â  Pate, 383 U.S. at 376, 385.Â  The U.S. Supreme Court concluded that because defense counsel placed the accusedâ€™s sanity in issue throughout the proceedings, there was no waiver.Â  Id. at 384.\r\nIn the present case during the trial defense counsel did not place in issue Belfortâ€™s ability to speak and comprehend English.Â  When the trial judge asked why Belfort had not been provided an interpreter, defense counsel replied, â€œYour Honor, when Iâ€™ve had my meetings with [Belfort], heâ€™s understood my talks with him.Â  I asked him if he needed an interpreter and he [said no].â€Â  Therefore, Blair and Pate do not support the proposition that a failure to raise the issue of the appointment of an interpreter need not be preserved for our review.\r\nWe are aware other jurisdictions do not require this issue to be preserved for appellate review.[3]Â  However, we are not prepared to overrule the long-standing rule that only preserved issues are appropriate adjudication. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.[4]\r\nBEATTY, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Belfort states in his brief, â€œCounsel did not make a motion for the appointment of a Haitian Creole interpreter for [Belfort].â€Â  (Appellantâ€™s Br. 9).\r\n[2] Under Illinois law, if the court is put on notice of facts which raise a bona fide doubt regarding a defendantâ€™s sanity, it becomes the duty of the court to determine if a defendant is competent to stand trial.Â  People v. Robinson, 22 Ill.2d 162, 167, 174 N.E.2d 820, 822 (1961). \r\n[3] See e.g., Garcia v. State, 149 S.W.3d 135, 143-45 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004) (If the trial court is aware that the defendant does not speak or understand English, defendant need not preserve by objection the trial courtâ€™s failure to appoint an interpreter.); Duroff v. Commonwealth, 192 Ky. 31, 34, 232 S.W. 47, 49 (1921) (The trial court is vested with a broad discretion in the matter of calling an interpreter. However, it is the duty of the court to call an interpreter when witnesses are unable to understand and speak English; yet, when they can understand and speak the English language reasonably well, it is not necessary to call an interpreter.); but see Luna v.

Miller, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-128\r\nSubmitted March 1, 2007 â€“ Filed March 23, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        John William Ray, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n        B.E. Kerns, of Taylors, D.A. Kerns, of Greer and Milton Baldwin, of Greenville, all pro se for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Attorney John William Ray appeals the circuit courtâ€™s imposition of Rule 11, SCRCP, sanctions against him and his client, BB&amp;T of South Carolina.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThis case requires a rather lengthy discussion of the facts in order to provide the backdrop for the imposition of sanctions against Ray and his client, BB&amp;T.Â  Ray has exclusively practiced in the areas of collection and bankruptcy work since 1990, and he has represented BB&amp;T in these actions since 1994.Â  While representing BB&amp;T, Ray developed the practice of attaching verified statements of account (VSA) to his proposed default orders, which he had signed himself.Â  Beginning in early 2000, issues arose relating to Rayâ€™s practice of signing the VSAs.Â  At that time, the chief administrative judge of the thirteenth circuit instructed all the circuitâ€™s judges to deny Rayâ€™s default judgment requests if Ray personally signed the VSAs.Â  After denying the second of Rayâ€™s signed VSAs, the circuit court also imposed prospective sanctions against Ray under Rule 11, SCRCP, in the event he filed another self-signed VSA.Â  On appeal, this court affirmed, finding the issues unpreserved.Â  The supreme court reversed, finding the issue preserved and holding Ray as agent of BB&amp;T and custodian of the files, could sign the VSAs himself.Â  The supreme court also removed the proactive sanctions against Ray because the sanctions were imposed based upon a misapplication of the law by the circuit court.[2]\r\nEvidently, the tension between Ray and the judges of the thirteenth circuit continued as further disagreements arose regarding Rayâ€™s handling of default actions on behalf of BB&amp;T.Â  In early 2005, the circuit court began a dialogue with Ray concerning his current practice of submitting proposed default judgment orders.Â  In these proposed orders, Ray requested an award of attorneyâ€™s fees but failed to provide his legal basisâ€”the contractual or statutory authorityâ€”that entitled him to such an award.Â  In April 2005, Ray filed a proposed order (first Kerns order)[3] requesting attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The circuit court denied the proposed order, finding Ray failed to provide in the proposed order any contractual or statutory authority authorizing an award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Immediately after denying the Kerns order, the circuit court sent Ray a letter, explaining that:\r\n\r\n  [F]or the Court to award attorneyâ€™s fees, there must be a provision regarding entitlement in the contract.Â  You have ignored the requirement and persisted to submit inappropriate proposed orders.Â  If you continue to submit proposed orders of default awarding attorneyâ€™s fees without sufficient proof of entitlement, sanctions will be imposed.\r\n\r\nRay responded in a letter in which he admitted the contract submitted with the Kerns complaint did not contain an attorneyâ€™s fees provision.Â  Ray explained, however, that attorneyâ€™s fees provisions are so common in this type of case that the circuit court could take judicial notice that he was entitled to fees.Â  Ray relied on Rule 8(d), SCRCP, to support this position, asserting that when a defendant is in default all allegations are deemed admitted, and with â€œdeemed admission,â€ submission of â€œfurther evidence of fees would be cumulative to those admissions and simply not needed.â€Â  Lastly, Ray stated that fees are â€œredundantlyâ€ addressed by statute, and therefore, he was entitled to them; however, the letter did not reference any statutory authority for the fees.\r\nIn reply to Rayâ€™s letter, all five judges of the thirteenth circuit signed a letter to Ray, once again explaining the requirements for obtaining default judgments.Â  The letter read:\r\n\r\n  It is the position of the Court of the Thirteenth Judicial Circuit that you produce the specific contractual provision that entitles you to attorneyâ€™s fees in all debt collection actions in which you seek attorneyâ€™s fees. Absent existence of such documentation . . . you must submit specific statutory authority proving your entitlement.Â  It is black letter law in South Carolina that attorneyâ€™s fees in a contract action are not recoverable absent a contractual provision or specific statutory authority.Â  Your signature on both the complaint and the default motion papers acts as certification of the veracity of the allegations.Â  Continuing to file documents seeking attorneyâ€™s fees without the proper authority or proof to receive them is improper and interferes with the orderly administration of the Court.Â  If you continue in this misleading practice, the Court will take appropriate action.\r\n\r\nShortly after receipt of this letter, Ray filed a notice of appeal of the denial of his proposed Kerns order.Â  However, that same day, and without notice to the circuit court, Ray filed a second Kerns order.Â  This second Kerns order was identical to the first Kerns order in every aspect except it did not contain an award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The circuit court, unaware the first Kerns order was under appeal, signed the second Kerns order.[4] Â \r\nIn June of 2005, the circuit court sent Ray a third letter directing him to refrain from submitting two different orders in a caseâ€”one with a request for attorneyâ€™s fees but no contractual or statutory authority, and one without a request for fees.Â  In late August and early September, Ray submitted two proposed default judgment orders in the cases of BB&amp;T v. Milton Baldwin and BB&amp;T v. Rachel Lamont, neither of which contained a request for attorneyâ€™s fees (Baldwin and Lamont orders).Â  The circuit court signed and filed both orders.Â  \r\nSimultaneous to the filing of the Lamont order, the circuit court sent a fourth letter to Ray requesting him to remove attorneyâ€™s fees language from the proposed orders he had sent to the court where in fact he had not made a request for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Thereafter, in late September, Ray filed a third proposed Kerns default order to the circuit court, in which he again requested attorneyâ€™s fees, notwithstanding the previously signed and filed second Kerns order.Â  That same day, Ray also filed successive orders in the Baldwin and Lamont cases, in which he requested attorneyâ€™s fees, again notwithstanding the previously signed and filed default orders in both those matters. Â \r\nIn October, the circuit court sent Ray a letter and rule to show cause asking him to explain, among other things, his submission of the successive orders in Kerns, Baldwin, and Lamont, and to set a hearing for sanctions under Rule 11, SCRCP.Â  After the hearing, at which Ray was present, the circuit court found Ray lacked good faith reasons to file the successive proposed orders, and that Ray interfered with the orderly administration of the court.Â  Therefore, the circuit court imposed Rule11 sanctions against Ray in the amount of $2,422, and against BB&amp;T in the amount of $1,000.Â  Ray filed a Rule 59(e) motion, which the court denied.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA trial judgeâ€™s ruling on Rule 11, SCRCP, sanctions will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion.Â  Russell v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., 370 S.C. 5, 19, 633 S.E.2d 722, 729 (2006); Culbertson v. Clemens, 322 S.C. 20, 24, 471 S.E.2d 163, 165 (1996). Â â€œAn abuse of discretion may be found where the trial judgeâ€™s conclusion had no reasonable factual support, resulted in prejudice to the rights of appellant, and therefore amounted to an error of law.â€Â  Id.Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.\r\nRay first argues the circuit court improperly sanctioned him under Rule 11, SCRCP, because his actions did not warrant sanctions.Â  Also, throughout his brief to this court, Ray argues the circuit court improperly raised the sanctions issue sua sponte. Â We disagree.\r\nRule 11, SCRCP, reads in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  The signature of an attorney or party constitutes a certificate by him that he has read the pleading, motion or other paper; that to the best of his knowledge, information and belief there is good ground to support it; and that it is not interposed for delay . . . If a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed in violation of this Rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, may impose upon the person who signed it, a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion or other paper, including a reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Rule 11, SCRCP, explicitly provides the circuit court with authority to impose appropriate sanctions for violations of the rule â€œupon its own initiative.â€Â  Therefore, Rayâ€™s contention is without merit.\r\nTurning to the sanction itself, the circuit court repeatedly cautioned and admonished Ray to include any contractual or statutory authority to support his request for fees in the proposed default orders.Â  Ray refused to do so.Â  Instead, Ray adopted the practice of submitting two proposed default orders to the circuit court for approval.Â  Under this practice, one proposed default order would not contain a request for attorneyâ€™s fees, and as a result, it would be signed by the circuit court.Â  Thereafter, Ray would submit another proposed default order in the same matter to the circuit court, but this time he would request feesâ€”but fail to attach or include the contractual or statutory authority for his requestâ€”even though the circuit court had already signed and filed an order in the matter.[5]Â  Moreover, Ray continued in this practice even after explicit instructions from the circuit court directing him to discontinue doing so.Â  \r\nAs a result of this conduct, the circuit court chose, in its broad discretion, to sanction Ray under Rule 11, SCRCP, for his submission of successive proposed default orders in Kerns, Baldwin, and Lamont because he had no â€œgood faith grounds or reasons to support them,â€ and that Rayâ€™s actions continue â€œto interfere with the orderly administration of the court.â€Â  There is sufficient evidence in the record to support these factual findings.Â  Therefore, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in finding Rayâ€™s conduct warranted sanctions under Rule 11, SCRCP.\r\nII.\r\nRay next argues service and notice of the rule to show cause were defective, that he was denied due process and equal protection, and that the circuit court lacked personal jurisdiction.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, we note Rayâ€™s argument regarding due process and equal protection are not preserved for appellate review because he did not raise the issue until his Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion.Â  See Patterson v. Reid, 318 S.C. 183, 185, 456 S.E.2d 436, 437 (Ct. App. 1995) (â€œA party cannot for the first time raise an issue by way of a Rule 59(e) motion which could have been raised at trial.â€).Â Â  \r\nAdditionally, Rayâ€™s appearance before the circuit court negates his arguments regarding service and jurisdiction.Â  See Rule 4(d), SCRCP; South Carolina Dept. of Social Services, on behalf of Roseboro v. Burris, 297 S.C. 537, 539, 377 S.E.2d 578, 579-80 (1989) (holding a voluntary appearance equivalent to proper service, which vests the court with jurisdiction).Â  Accordingly, we find Rayâ€™s arguments without merit. \r\nIII.\r\nRayâ€™s remaining issues can be summarized as follows: (1) the sanctions are void because of the circuit courtâ€™s intemperance and prejudice against him personally; (2) the circuit court misapplied the law; (3) the circuit court disregarded the record in making its own findings of fact; (4) the sanctions are arbitrary; and (5) Ray had a good faith basis to file the successive motions.Â  We disagree.\r\nOn appeal there is a presumption in favor of the correctness of a decree, and the burden of showing error by the circuit court is on the appellant.Â  Snyderâ€™s Auto World, Inc. v. George Coleman Motor Co., Inc., 315 S.C. 183, 186, 434 S.E.2d 310, 312 (Ct. App. 1993); Cook v. Eller, 298 S.C. 395, 398, 380 S.E.2d 853, 855 (Ct. App. 1989).\r\nAs we have held, the circuit court was within its discretion in sanctioning Ray for his practice of filing multiple proposed default orders, despite numerous admonitions not to do so.Â  Rayâ€™s arguments fail to carry his burden of establishing reversible error.Â  Moreover, the record does not support the arguments Ray advances to this court. Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the circuit courtâ€™s decision to impose sanctions against Ray and BB&amp;T is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Â The above facts are taken from BB&amp;T of South Carolina v. Fleming, 360 S.C. 341, 601 S.E.2d 540 (2004). \r\n[3] Â The order was submitted in an action captioned BB&amp;T Bankcard Corporation v. B.E. Kerns &amp; D.A. Kerns.\r\n[4] Â Ray claims he did not submit the second Kerns order while his appeal from the first Kerns order was pending.Â  However, the record does not support his contention.Â  For example, after receiving the second Kerns order that was signed by the court, Ray sent a letter to this court asking for an extension.Â  This court received his extension request the day after the circuit court mailed the second Kerns order, indicating Ray had in fact filed his appeal of the first Kerns order after he submitted the second Kerns order.Â  Additionally, correspondence between Ray and this court indicates Ray continued to pursue his appeal of the first Kerns order even after receipt of the signed second Kerns order.Â  Over two months elapsed before Ray withdrew his appeal of the first Kerns order.Â  \r\n[5] Â At the hearing, Ray admitted he was aware and familiar with Rules 59 and 60, SCRCP; however, he did not use those post judgment relief procedures to seek his award of attorneyâ€™s fees in Kerns, Baldwin, or Lamont.Â  Rather, he simply filed successive, nearly identical, orders with the court seeking such relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-129","title":"Blanton v.

Anderson, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No.Â  2007-UP-129\r\nHeard January 10, 2007 â€“ Filed March 23, 2007Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        William G. Rhoden, of Gaffney, for Appellant.Â  \r\n        Grace Gilchrist Knie, of Spartanburg and John S. Nichols, of Columbia, for Respondent. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: Tracy Blanton (Husband) appeals the family courtâ€™s valuation of his business.Â  Husband contends the family court erred in valuing the business without evidentiary support and in relying on expert testimony concerning fair market value indicators.Â  Husband also argues the family court erred in its award of expert fees.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nLinda Blanton (Wife) and Husband married on May 28, 1994.Â  Both worked at Timekin until Wife left to study occupational therapy.Â  Husband also left Timekin to teach masonry at a technical institute, and later began his own construction business, Blanton Construction.Â  \r\nMr. Ben Kochenower testified as Wifeâ€™s expert regarding Blanton Constructionâ€™s value.Â  Kochenower is a Certified Public Accountant with offices in South Carolina.Â  Kochenower used tax returns, financial statements, and depreciation schedules to value Blanton Construction at a low end value of $67,807.Â  Additionally, Kochenower examined sales of forty-seven similar construction companies to calculate the value of Blanton Construction at a high end value of $247,536. Â Kochenower testified $67,807 and $247,536 are an â€œindication of value,â€ and value indicators are typically less than fair market value. \r\nKochenower also testified that his hourly rate is $165, and he worked on this case approximately forty to fifty hours.Â  He charged Wife $5,000 for his services, but Wife testified she was not able to pay Kochenowerâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nLike Wife, Husband enlisted an expert to testify regarding the value of Blanton Construction.Â  Husbandâ€™s expert was his accountant, Gail Humphries.Â  Humphries also did not testify regarding fair market value, but assessed the â€œnet worth valueâ€ of the business at $17,208. Humphries examined Blanton Constructionâ€™s assets, liabilities, and credit cards.Â  Additionally, Humphries relied heavily on information provided by Husband in her valuation of Blanton Construction.Â  However, Humphries did not consider Husbandâ€™s personal checking account, which contained $72,686, in her valuation. \r\nThe trial court valued Blanton Construction at $100,000 and awarded Wife $5,000 in expert fees.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn domestic matters, we may find facts based on the preponderance of the evidence, but we are not required to disregard the findings of the family court judge, who was in a better position to evaluate the witnessesâ€™ testimony and credibility.Â  Doe v. Doe,&nbsp;319 S.C. 151, 155, 459 S.E.2d 892, 894&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA. Evidentiary Support\r\nHusband argues the family courtâ€™s valuation of Blanton Construction lacks evidentiary support.Â  We agree.\r\nWhen valuing marital property, a business should be valued at its fair market value as a going concern.Â  Brandi v. Brandi, 302 S.C. 353, 357, 396 S.E.2d 124, 126 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  â€œ[F]air market value is the amount of money which a purchaser willing but not obligated to buy the property would pay an owner willing but not obligated to sell it, taking into account all uses to which the property is adapted and might in reason be applied.â€Â  Reid v. Reid, 280 S.C. 367, 373, 312 S.E.2d 724, 727 (Ct. App. 1984) (internal quotations omitted).Â  Factors to consider when determining the fair market value include â€œinventory, accounts payable and receivable, and other legitimate assets or liabilities.â€Â  Brandi, 302 S.C. at 357, 396 S.E.2d at 126.Â  \r\nSouth Carolina Code Section 20-7-474(1) (Supp. 2005) provides that when determining values of property for equitable apportionment, the family court â€œshall make findings of fact from credible evidence . . . .â€Â  \r\nIn this case, the family court valued Blanton Construction at $100,000. The family courtâ€™s order merely listed the expertsâ€™ valuations of Blanton Construction.Â  Even though the valuation was within the range provided by the two experts, the family court made no evidentiary findings to support its conclusion as required by section 20-7-474(1). \r\nWe note that neither Wifeâ€™s expert nor Husbandâ€™s expert testified regarding the exact fair market value of Blanton Construction.Â  Kochenowerâ€™s testimony concerned indicators of fair market value.Â  Humphries valued the businessâ€™s net worth at $17,208.Â  The dissent argues Humphriesâ€™ testimony regarding net worth should be accepted.Â  Net worth is obtained by subtracting liabilities from assets.Â  Blackâ€™s law dictionary 1639 (8th ed. 2004).Â  However, a business is to be valued at its fair market value as a going concern.Â  Brandi, 302 S.C. at 357, 396 S.E.2d at 126.Â  \r\nA going concern is a â€œcommercial enterprise actively engaging in business with the expectation of indefinite continuance.â€Â  Blackâ€™s law dictionary 712 (8th ed. 2004).Â  Net worth and going concern differ in that the former does not take into account the ability of a business to continue.Â  Rather, net worth calculates the difference between a businessâ€™s assets and liabilities at a fixed point in time, without taking into account the ability of a business to continue.Â  The two terms are not synonymous.Â  Additionally, we find it hard to accept that a trained CPA, such as Humphries, would mistakenly use a term such as net worth in place of fair market value.Â  We believe the family court, which observed Kochenowerâ€™s and Humphriesâ€™ testimony, is in the best position to resolve this difference.Â  \r\nThe issue of Blanton Constructionâ€™s value is remanded to the family court for a determination of the fair market value, and the family court must delineate how that valuation is reached pursuant to section 20-7-474.[1] Accordingly, we reverse and remand for revaluation of the business. Â Â \r\nB. Expert Testimony\r\nHusband contends the family court erred in admitting expert testimony concerning indicators of fair market value.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe admissibility of expert testimony is within the discretion of the trial judge.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Bacot, 280 S.C. 485, 490, 313 S.E.2d 45, 48 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Expert testimony, addressed in Rule 702, SCRE, states: â€œ[I]f scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.â€Â  \r\nTo determine the value of Blanton Construction, Kochenower examined tax returns, financial statements prepared by Humphries, bank statements, cancelled checks, and personal tax returns.Â  Kochenower also interviewed Humphries and Husband and requested information on closings and contracts with properties that Husband developed and sold.Â  Kochenower testified regarding the factors of fair market value, although he hesitated to testify regarding the exact fair market value of Blanton Construction. \r\nKochenowerâ€™s statements regarding fair market value are admissible as expert testimony under Rule 702 because his statements may have assisted the family court judge, as trier of fact, in determining Blanton Constructionâ€™s fair market value.Â  Accordingly, the family court would not be in error if it chose to use the Wifeâ€™s expert testimony in arriving at its own conclusion as to the fair market value.\r\nNonetheless, Husband argues Wifeâ€™s expert should not be able to testify as to the indicators of value.Â  In other words, Husband argues that because Wifeâ€™s expert was unable to give a fair market value, his testimony should be excluded.Â  If this logic was applied to Husbandâ€™s expert, her testimony would also be excluded because Humphries did not testify as to the ultimate issue of fair market value.[2]Â  We believe Rule 702, SCRE, was implemented to avoid such a scenario.\r\nC. Expert Fees\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in awarding expert fees.Â  We agree.\r\nThe family court is authorized to use its discretion when awarding expert fees.Â  Crawford v. Crawford, 301 S.C. 476, 484, 392 S.E.2d 675, 680 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  However, if the family court did not rely on Wifeâ€™s expert, there is no basis to award expert fees.Â  Because the family court did not delineate how it arrived at the value of Blanton Construction, we are unable to determine if the family court actually relied on Wifeâ€™s expert.Â  \r\nTherefore, the family courtâ€™s award of $5,000 in expert fees is reversed and remanded.Â  We note that if on remand the family court does rely on Wifeâ€™s expert in analyzing the fair market value, it may use its discretion to award Wife expert fees.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the family courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nKITTREDGE, J., concurs. \r\nHEARN, C.J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part):\r\nI concur in the majorityâ€™s decision to reverse the family courtâ€™s valuation of Blanton Construction at $100,000, and write separately only to express my view that sufficient competent evidence of valuation exists in the record to allow this court to finally resolve the matter.[3]\r\nIn appeals from the family court, the appellate court has the authority to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102 (2005).Â  Moreover, when an order from the family court is issued without the required factual findings, the appellate court may remand the matter to the trial court or, â€œwhere the record is sufficient, make its own findings of fact in accordance with the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Griffith v. Griffith, 332 S.C. 630, 646-47, 506 S.E.2d 526, 535 (Ct. App. 1998) (quoting Holcombe v. Hardee, 304 S.C. 522, 524, 405 S.E.2d 821, 822 (1991)).\r\nIn Brandi v. Brandi, 302 S.C. 353, 396 S.E.2d 124 (Ct. App. 1990), our court addressed a situation similar to this matterâ€”the valuation of a marital business in the context of an equitable distribution.Â  In Brandi, the husband argued the family court improperly valued his business.Â  Id. at 356, 396 S.E.2d at 126.Â  Our court agreed and held the family court erred because it failed to value Husbandâ€™s business â€œat its fair market value . . . .â€Â  Id.Â  After so finding, this court explained it had â€œhoped to resolve this matter on the record;â€ however, the record did not contain the evidence necessary to allow such a finding.Â  Therefore, only after finding the record insufficient did our court remand the action to the family court to make the appropriate valuation.Â  Id. \r\nHere, unlike Brandi, the record on appeal is sufficient for us to make the findings of fact necessary to value Blanton Construction.Â  In the interest of judicial economy, I believe we should undertake the valuation rather than remand to the family court.Â  See, e.g., Buist v. Huggins, 367 S.C. 268, 275, 625 S.E.2d 636, 639 (2006) (deciding to address the merits of an issue in the interest of judicial economy when the trial court had already heard arguments and addressed the issue, and the record on appeal provided sufficient evidence to make a finding of fact); Southern Bell Tel. and Tel. Co. v. Hamm, 360 S.C. 70, 75, 409 S.E.2d 775, 778 (1991) (electing to address an issue on appeal in the interest of judicial economy after both parties had fully briefed the issue).Â  \r\nWhen valuing marital property for the purposes of equitable distribution, a business should be valued at its fair market value as an ongoing business.Â  RGM v. DEM, 306 S.C. 145, 152, 410 S.E.2d 564, 568 (1991).Â  Moreover, when the goodwill of a business is dependent upon the business ownerâ€™s future earnings, as is the case here, goodwill is too speculative to be included in the marital estate.Â  Casey v. Casey, 293 S.C. 503, 504, 362 S.E.2d 6, 7 (1987); see also Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 359, 384 S.E.2d 741, 745 (1989) (acknowledging that because goodwill is dependent upon future earnings, it is too speculative to be included in the valuation of a business for equitable distribution purposes).Â  \r\nThis case is nearly identical to the situation in Casey.Â Â  In that case, Husband owned a fireworks business and operated it as a sole proprietorship.Â  Casey, 293 S.C. at 504, 362 S.E.2d at 6.Â  At trial, Wifeâ€™s expert testified to the fair market value of the business, including the tangible value of the businessâ€™s assets and goodwill.Â  Id.Â  The family court, in making the equitable distribution, awarded Wife a portion of the businessâ€™s fixed assets and goodwill.Â  Id.Â  The supreme court reversed, holding goodwill was too speculative to be included in the marital estate, and accordingly, that Wife was only entitled to a portion of the tangible assets of Husbandâ€™s business.Â  Id. at 505, 362 S.E.2d at 7.Â  Likewise, in this matter, Wife is only entitled to an equitable distribution of the tangible assets of Blanton Construction, as any goodwill from Husbandâ€™s efforts with the sole proprietorship would be dependent on his future earnings and are too speculative to include in the equitable distribution. \r\nAt trial, both Husband and Wife relied on expert testimony to assist the court in establishing the fair market value of Blanton Construction.Â  Ben Kochenower, Wifeâ€™s expert, relied upon tax returns, financial statements, depreciation schedules, bank statements, cancelled checks, and personal tax returns in his attempt to value Blanton Construction.Â  Additionally, Kochenower examined sales of forty-seven other construction companies to assist in his valuation.Â  He, however, did not use the tangible assets or liabilities of the company in his valuation method.Â  Instead, Kochenower only provided â€œindicators of valueâ€ to the family court, not a fair market value.Â  Husband relied on the expert testimony of Gail Humphries, the accountant for the business who testified directly to the tangible asset value of Blanton Construction.Â  Humphries calculated the tangible asset value at $17,208 after taking into account the companyâ€™s tangible assets less outstanding liabilities.[4]Â  While Humphries used â€œnet worth valueâ€ rather than the magic words â€œfair market value,â€ it is evident from Humphriesâ€™ entire testimony that she placed a fair market value on the business as its tangible assets only.Â  This view of valuation is consistent with the principles espoused in Casey.\r\nPursuant to my belief that only the tangible asset value of this business is subject to equitable distribution, sufficient evidence exists in the record to value Blanton Construction at $17,208.Â  Accordingly, a remand to the family court is both unnecessary and contrary to the interest of judicial economy.[5]\r\n\r\n[1] Additionally, the family court should note that when the goodwill of a business is dependent upon the business ownerâ€™s future earnings, the goodwill is too speculative for inclusion in the valuation of the marital estate.Â  Casey v. Casey, 293 S.C. 503, 504, 362 S.E.2d 6, 7 (1987).\r\n[2] Husband stated in his brief, â€œMrs. Humphries gave no opinion as to the fair market value of Blanton Construction.â€ \r\n[3] Â Consistent with my view that no remand is warranted, I concur only in the majorityâ€™s decision to reverse the award of expert fees to Wife.\r\n[4] Â In the opinion, the majority notes that â€œHumphries did not consider Husbandâ€™s personal checking account, which contained $72,686 . . .â€ on October 7, 2003.Â  When questioned on cross-examination about this amount, Humphries responded that while this amount was relevant â€œyou would also have to his consider his other debts. . . . Heâ€™s got to pay back the bank.â€Â  Moreover, at oral arguments it was acknowledged that same account contained less than $1,000 at the end of the month.\r\n[5] Â Based on my disposition, I need not address the issue as to whether the family court could properly rely on indicators of fair market value in valuing Blanton Construction.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (stating appellate court need not address remaining issues when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).

Bartlett, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-130\r\nSubmitted March 1, 2007 â€“ Filed March 23, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Donald Bruce Clark, and Robert N. Rosen, both of Charleston and Lawrence E. Richter, Jr., of Mt. Pleasant, for Appellant.\r\n        John Graham Altman, III, of Hanahan, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Vicky Griffith (Griffith) appeals the family courtâ€™s decision that it lacked jurisdiction to hear her motion asking the court to construe and enforce its final custody order regarding reasonable telephone contact.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nGriffith and Bart Altman (Altman) never married, but they have a son, born May 27, 1999.Â  On December 6, 2004, Altman was awarded custody of their son, and the court issued an order providing a visitation schedule. Â Part of the order provided that â€œ[b]oth parents shall have reasonable and at all times private telephone contact with the child . . . .â€Â  \r\nOn March 13, 2006, Griffith filed a motion asking the court to define specific times for telephone communication between herself and the child.Â  Griffith also sought attorneyâ€™s fees related to the motion.Â  Griffith submitted affidavits in support of her motion, and Altman submitted an affidavit in response to the motion.Â  \r\nOn May 1, 2006, the court held a hearing on Griffithâ€™s motion.Â  After hearing arguments from both sides, the court dismissed the motion due to a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  On June 21, 2006, Griffith timely filed a motion for reconsideration and requested the court alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59 (e), SCRCP.Â  The court denied the motion.Â  This appeal follows.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGriffith argues the family court erred in refusing to construe and enforce its final order that granted Griffith â€œreasonableâ€ telephone contact with her child.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe pivotal issue before this Court is whether the relief Griffith sought in her motion is either a clarification of the Final Order or a modification of the Final Order.Â  In construing or clarifying an ambiguous order, the determinative factor is to ascertain the intent of the judge who wrote the order.Â  Eddins v. Eddins, 304 S.C. 133, 135, 403 S.E.2d 164, 166 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  On the other hand, to modify a final order, the party seeking modification must show a substantial or material change of circumstances.Â  Sharps v. Sharps, 342 S.C. 71, 76, 535 S.E.2d 913, 916 (2000).Â  \r\nGriffith requested that the family court define â€œspecific times for telephone communicationâ€ between the child and the parents. Â Griffith contends the use of the term â€œreasonableâ€ is ambiguous and should be defined by this Court. \r\nGriffith cites Cannon v. Cannon, 275 S.C. 424, 272 S.E.2d 179 (1980) to support her argument that the Final Order should be construed and specific telephone contact should be defined.Â  In Cannon, the Mrs. Cannon requested an order requiring Mr. Cannon to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for refusing to allow her to obtain items of personal property as provided for in the Final Order.Â  After a contempt hearing, the family court found there was â€œsome basis for misunderstanding between the parties due to the fact that the previous order was not explicit enough to be enforced.â€Â  Consequently, the family court refused to find Mr. Cannon in contempt; instead it specified which items of personal property belonged to each party.Â  Cannon, at 425, 272 S.E.2d at 179.Â  \r\nThe case at bar differs from Cannon in both its procedural posture and in the effect that defining the alleged ambiguous term will have on the parties.Â  Unlike Cannon, Griffith has not brought an action in contempt, rather she has brought a motion to define the term â€œreasonable.â€Â  Also, whereas the ruling in Cannon specified the items referred to in the Final Order, Griffithâ€™s request would put a burden on each parent by mandating that each rearrange their lives around a precise telephone visitation schedule.\r\nIn this case, the family court correctly found that imposing a telephone contact schedule would have a significant impact on the childâ€™s daily routine as well as each parentâ€™s daily routine.Â  This impact would constitute a material change. Â Griffith did not file a motion for modification of the Final Order and did not allege a substantial or material change in circumstances.Â  Therefore, we find no error in the family courtâ€™s dismissal of Griffithâ€™s action.Â  In light of our disposition of the case, it is not necessary to address Griffithâ€™s remaining issues.Â  Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518, S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (appellate court need not address remaining issues when disposition of prior issue is dispositive).Â  \r\nAccordingly, the family courtâ€™s decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nHUFF, BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-131","title":"State v.

Williams, Sr., of Lexington, for Appellant.Â  \r\nShawn L. Reeves, of Columbia, for Respondent. Â \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  All Out Bail Bonding, Inc. (All Out) appeals the partial estreatment of Elizabeth Rosette Bushâ€™s bond.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn December 2004, All Out provided a $15,000 bond for Bush necessitated by her indictment for second-degree arson.Â  When Bush failed to comply with several provisions of her bond, including failing to report to the bonding company and failing to notify All Out of a change in her address and telephone number, All Out moved the court to be relieved from its obligation.Â  That motion was denied.Â  However, a special condition was added to Bushâ€™s bond that she was â€œnot to leave the residence without first notifying Bonding Company.â€Â  In January of 2006, All Out moved again to be relieved of its obligation based on Bushâ€™s arrest on new charges and a violation of the special condition of her bond.Â  The request was denied.Â  Bush had failed to appear in court in May of 2005 and March of 2006.Â  Finally, Bush failed to appear again in April 2006, and a bench warrant was issued for her arrest.Â  At a hearing on June 9, 2006, the court determined that $2,500 of Bushâ€™s bond should be estreated.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe issue of whether a bond forfeiture should be remitted, and if so, to what extent, is vested in the discretion of the trial judge.&nbsp; Â State v. Workman, 274 S.C. 341, 343, 263 S.E.2d 865, 866 (1980) (citing State v. Holloway, 262 S.C. 552, 557, 206 S.E.2d 822, 824 (1974)).Â  â€œRelief from bond forfeiture is in the discretion of the trial court.â€Â  State v. Boatwright, 310 S.C. 281, 283, 423 S.E.2d 139, 141 (1992).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law or when based on factual conclusions is without evidentiary support.Â  State v. McClinton, 369 S.C. 167, 170, 631 S.E.2d 895, 896 (2006).Â  An abuse of discretion also occurs when the ruling reveals no discretion was exercised.Â  Id.\r\n\r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAll Out argues that the court abused its discretion in estreating Bushâ€™s bond when the company had asked to be relieved of its surety obligation on two prior occasions.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn considering whether to grant relief from a bond forfeiture the court must consider (1) the purpose of the bond, (2) the nature and willfulness of the default, and (3) any prejudice or additional expense resulting to the State. Â See Workman, 274 S.C. at 343, 263 S.E.2d at 866.Â  In this case, the court determined that All Out had attempted to keep track of Bush and that her compliance with the bond conditions had been problematic from the beginning.Â  Nevertheless, the court concluded the purpose of the bond, to insure Bushâ€™s appearance, was not met, the State was prejudiced by Bushâ€™s failure to appear, and her violations seemed to be willful.Â  Based on its consideration of these factors, the court decided to estreat the bond in the amount of $2,500.Â  The record shows that the court considered the requisite factors and exercised its discretion to estreat the bond, not in the full amount, but in the partial amount of $2,500.Â  We discern no abuse.Â  \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-132","title":"King v.

King and Robbie King Jones (Appellants), as representatives of W.R. King and Ellen King (parents), appeal the circuit courtâ€™s order dismissing this action for failure to prosecute and allowing Margie B. King and Robbie Patricia Ione King (Respondents) to proceed with their counterclaims.Â  We affirm.[1]  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn November 1998, Appellants filed this action for enforcement of a loan and ownership/operation of Kingâ€™s Funeral Home.[2]Â  Respondents filed a timely answer. Â In November 1999, Appellants filed an amended complaint in which they dismissed one defendant.Â  Respondents again filed a timely answer in which they asserted additional counterclaims.Â  \r\nIn April 2001, Appellants served a â€œRequest for Leave to Amendâ€ and a â€œFirst Amended Complaintâ€ on Respondents.Â  Appellants sought to add plaintiffs and defendants and new causes of action.Â  However, the â€œFirst Amended Complaintâ€ was neither authorized by an order of the circuit court nor by consent of the parties. \r\nBy letter dated May 3, 2001, Judge Alford informed Appellants they may amend their complaint to add new parties.Â  Judge Alford instructed Appellants to â€œprepare a proposed order in that regard and send a copy of the prepared order to opposing counsel at the same time you send it to me.â€Â  \r\nIn May 2001, Respondents deposed two of Appellantsâ€™ witnesses: Robbie King Jones and Moses Caldwell.Â  During the deposition of Robbie King Jones, a disagreement arose regarding Respondentsâ€™ questioning and Appellantsâ€™ counselâ€™s interjections.Â  Respondents terminated the deposition â€œuntil [they] could come before [the court] and get a ruling onâ€ the objections and actions by Appellants.Â  After Robbie King Jonesâ€™ deposition ended, counsel for Appellants informed Caldwell he did not have to appear at his deposition.Â  Although he initially refused to go to the deposition, the sheriff persuaded Caldwell to obey the subpoena and appear at his deposition.Â  However, Caldwell refused to answer any of Respondentsâ€™ questions because Appellantsâ€™ counsel was not present.Â  Thereafter, Respondents filed a motion for contempt, a motion to compel removal of a lis pendens, motion for protective order against Appellantsâ€™ counselâ€™s speaking objections during depositions, a motion for stay, and a motion to compel answers to discovery requests.Â  \r\nOn June 1, 2001, the circuit court held a hearing to consider motions and matters of concern between the parties.Â  During this hearing, the circuit court acknowledged both parties have at some point failed to cooperate with the discovery process.[3]Â  The circuit court then informed both parties discovery must be completed forthwith in order to get the case ready for trial.Â  The circuit court also warned both parties that â€œif there are any further impediments to the discovery, any other problems with it, I will consider sanctions.â€Â  The circuit court further noted the possible sanctions include dismissing the case altogether for failure to cooperate.Â  \r\nAlso during the hearing, the circuit court held Appellants had ten days to provide supplemental answers to Respondentsâ€™ interrogatories.Â  In addition, the circuit court instructed Appellants to provide documents and answers to Respondentsâ€™ discovery requests in compliance with the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  Thereafter, the circuit court stated directly to Appellants: â€œGive [the Respondents] the information they want; quit stonewalling.Â  You run the risk of getting this whole lawsuit thrown out.â€Â  \r\nAs to the lis pendens on Respondentsâ€™ property, the circuit court held the Respondents needed to provide information proving the property was not related to the law suit and then Appellants would have to remove the lis pendens.Â  \r\nThe circuit court considered also Appellantsâ€™ motion to amend the complaint.Â  The court agreed the complaint should be amended to include all interested parties; however, the court also informed Appellants they â€œshouldnâ€™t serve an amended complaint until you get permission from the court to do that . . . file it and then you can file an amended complaint and serve people.â€Â  The court then instructed Appellants to â€œprepare [the court] another orderâ€ to add the interested parties.Â  The court also stated that â€œif [Appellants have] already submitted . . . an order, Iâ€™ll sign it.â€Â  \r\nAfter the circuit court heard and ruled on all motions, the court asked Respondents to prepare an order extending the time for discovery to one hundred and twenty days to allow the new parties time to complete discovery.Â  The court also told Appellants: â€œIâ€™m going to allow you to amend to add the parties you want to add . . . and allow you to file an amended complaint.â€Â  Then, before the hearing ended, Respondents asked whether they could â€œdraft a proposed order and it wonâ€™t be next week or the next week . . .;â€ the court answered affirmatively.Â  \r\nAfter the June 2001 hearing, neither party filed any order.Â  A status conference was scheduled for March 18, 2004.Â  The status conference was apparently cancelled when Appellants were late.Â  \r\nIn April 2004, Respondents filed a motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute.Â  After a hearing, the circuit court held dismissal was warranted based on Appellantsâ€™ â€œwillful violation and total disregard of [court orders]â€ and repeated failure to litigate this matter.Â  The court also held Respondentsâ€™ counterclaims remained viable.Â  Appellants filed a motion to reconsider, which the circuit court denied.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhether an action should be dismissed for failure to prosecute is left to the discretion of the [circuit court], and [its] decision will not be disturbed, except upon a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.â€Â  McComas v. Ross, 368 S.C. 59, 62, 626 S.E.2d 902, 904 (Ct. App. 2006). Â An abuse of discretion occurs (1) when the courtâ€™s ruling is based upon an error of law, such as application of the wrong legal principle; (2) when based upon factual conclusions, the ruling is without evidentiary support; (3) when the court is vested with discretion, but the ruling reveals no discretion was exercised; or (4) when the ruling does not fall within the range of permissible decisions applicable in a particular case.Â  Ex parte: Capital U-Drive-It, Inc., 369 S.C. 1, 5, 630 S.E.2d 464, 467 (2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Dismissal for Failure to Prosecute \r\nAppellants contend the circuit court erred in dismissing their case for failure to prosecute.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nRule 41(b), SCRCP, provides that a defendant may move for dismissal of an action for failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure or any order of court.Â  â€œThe plaintiff has the burden of prosecuting his action, and the trial court may properly dismiss an action for plaintiffâ€™s unreasonable neglect in proceeding with his cause.â€Â  Don Shevey &amp; Spires, Inc. v. Am. Motors Realty Corp., 279 S.C. 58, 60, 301 S.E.2d 757, 758 (1983). Â â€œSuch power is deemed to be necessarily vested in trial courts [in order for them] to manage their own affairs so as to achieve orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.â€Â \r\nCrestwood Golf Club, Inc. v. Potter, 328 S.C. 201, 212, 493 S.E.2d 826, 832 (1997) (citation omitted).\r\nGenerally, the dismissal of actions for failure to prosecute is appropriate in cases where: (1) the dismissals are imposed to maintain the orderly disposition of cases in the face of repeated warnings or multiple opportunities to proceed with trial; and (2) only then upon a finding of unreasonable neglect.Â  McComas v. Ross, 368 S.C. 59, 62, 626 S.E.2d 902, 904 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  In addition,\r\nâ€œthere must be some showing of indifference to the rights of the defendant.â€Â  Id. at 63, 626 S.E.2d at 904.\r\nAs this court noted in McComas, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals requires trial courts to consider four factors before dismissing a case for failure to prosecute: 1) the plaintiffâ€™s degree of personal responsibility; (2) the amount of prejudice caused the defendant; (3) the presence of a drawn out history of deliberately proceeding in a dilatory fashion; and (4) the effectiveness of sanctions less drastic than dismissal.â€ Â Id. at 63, 626 S.E.2d at 904-05 (citing Hillig v. Commâ€™r of Internal Revenue, 916 F.2d 171, 174 (4th Cir. 1990)).\r\nIn this case, we find the circuit court did not commit an abuse of discretion in dismissing Appellantsâ€™ case for failure to prosecute because the dismissal came after repeated warnings, Appellants had infinite opportunities to move the case forward, Appellants unreasonably neglected to proceed with their cause of action, and Appellants demonstrated an indifference to Respondentsâ€™ rights.Â  The circuit court instructed Appellants numerous times to comply with discovery and file an amended complaint.Â  The circuit court also warned Appellants that further illegitimate delays in discovery could lead to dismissal.Â  The record fails to demonstrate that Appellants complied with all of the courtâ€™s requests.[4]Â  In addition, the only reason this case has not moved forward is because Appellants have neglected to file an amended complaint; therefore, Appellants had unlimited opportunities to proceed to trial.Â  Further, from the June 2001 hearing through Respondentsâ€™ filing of the motion to dismiss, Appellants failed to demonstrate that they took any steps toward moving this case forward, and thereby demonstrated an extreme indifference to the rights of the Respondents.Â  Based on these facts, we cannot find the circuit court abused its discretion in dismissing this case. Â \r\nAppellants assert the trial court erred in relying on Georganne Apparel, Inc. v. Todd, 303 S.C. 87, 399 S.E.2d 16 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  We disagree.\r\nGeorganne Apparel involved a long history of delays by the plaintiffs.Â  In September 1986 the circuit court, at the plaintiffâ€™s request, struck the case from the trial roster pursuant to Rule 40(c)(3), SCRCP. Â The case was reinstated a year later at the plaintiffâ€™s request.Â  On February 22, 1988, the plaintiff and the defendant accountants entered into a consent order whereby the plaintiff agreed to limit its claim against the accountants to professional negligence only.Â  On May 16, 1988, the circuit court, upon a motion by the defendant accountants, issued an order precluding the plaintiff from calling its designated accounting expert as a witness because the plaintiff had failed to cooperate with the defendant accountants in setting up a deposition of the expert witness.Â  In an order of May 20, 1988, more than two years after the original complaint, the circuit court granted the plaintiffâ€™s motion to dismiss the case without prejudice pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2), SCRCP, on the conditions that it pay costs to the defendants before refilling and that it limit the refilled action to those causes of action set forth in the current complaint as limited by the consent order.Â  On September 15, 1988, the plaintiff filed a new complaint which named a new defendant and added numerous causes of action, thereby violating the circuit courtâ€™s order.\r\nThe circuit court on November 30, 1988, dismissed the case with prejudice.Â  The court found that the plaintiffâ€™s addition of a new defendant and causes of action were in blatant violation of the May 20, 1988, order. Â The court also stated that it was â€œmindful of the history of abuse this case presents.â€Â  The court noted the plaintiff had made representations to the court that were contradicted by an affidavit.Â  The court also found that the defendants were prejudiced by the plaintiffâ€™s actions.Â  The circuit court concluded:\r\n\r\nIn sum, Plaintiff's willful and blatant violation of the expressed terms and conditions contained in [the circuit courtâ€™s order] of May 20, 1988, is the final chapter in the history of Plaintiffâ€™s unwillingness to follow the rules and orders of this Court, which activity brings into disrepute our legal system and the rules under which it operates. Accordingly, and mindful of the totality of circumstances, the Court is of the opinion that it should exercise its discretion under Rule 41(a)(2) and (b) to dismiss these actions with prejudice.Â  \r\n\r\nGeorganne Apparel, 303 S.C. at 92, 399 S.E.2d at 18-19.\r\nThis court held the trial court was clearly within its discretionary powers when it granted relief under the terms of Rule 41(a)(2) and (b) and that the relief granted was not too harsh under the totality of the circumstances.Â  Id. at 92, 399 S.E.2d at 19.Â Â  \r\nThe facts and procedural history in Georganne Apparel do differ from those in the present case as cases are rarely exactly alike.Â  However, as in Georganne Apparel, this case also involves a â€œwillful and blatant violationâ€ of the courtâ€™s order.Â  The circuit court specifically instructed Appellants to provide an order allowing the amendment of the complaint and to comply with discovery.Â  Appellants failed to comply with these instructions for over two and a half years. Â As this court stated in Georganne Apparel, Â â€œ[t]here is a limit beyond which the court should allow a litigant to consume time of the court and to prolong unnecessarily time, effort, and costs to defending parties.â€Â  Id. at 92, 399 S.E.2d at 19. Â We find no error in the circuit courtâ€™s citation of Georganne Apparel.Â  \r\nAppellants contend the circuit court erred in dismissing the case because any substantial delay in prosecuting the case was caused by identifying the numerous heirs to the estate involved and complicated issues not involved in ordinary litigation.Â  This argument was neither raised to nor ruled on by the trial court.Â  Therefore, it is not preserved for our review.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).Â  At the hearing, Appellantsâ€™ only argument against dismissal was their counselâ€™s contention that he believed Respondentsâ€™ counsel was going to prepare the order.Â  Respondentsâ€™ counsel explained that he only volunteered to draft the discovery scheduling order.Â  Earlier in the June 2001 hearing the circuit court had specifically instructed Appellantsâ€™ counsel to draft the order allowing the amendment of Appellantsâ€™ complaint.Â  As this was a matter of judging the credibility of the parties, we defer to the circuit court and find the court did not err in declining to accept Appellantsâ€™ excuse.Â  See Menne v. Keowee Key Property Ownersâ€™ Assâ€™n, Inc., 368 S.C. 557, 567, 629 S.E.2d 690, 696 (Ct. App. 2006) (â€œBecause the appellate court lacks the opportunity for direct observation of the witnesses, it should accord great deference to trial court findings where matters of credibility are involved.â€).\r\nAppellants also argue that public policy favors sanctions be directed toward the individual responsible for violating the court order rather than the innocent parties.Â  Thus, the circuit court should have sanctioned their attorney rather than dismissing their case.Â  This issue was neither raised to nor ruled on by the circuit court.Â  Thus, it is not properly before this court. Â See Wilder Corp., 330 S.C. at 76, 497 S.E.2d at 733 (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€). \r\nII.&nbsp; Failure to Dismiss Respondentsâ€™ Counterclaims \r\nAppellants next assert the circuit court erred in allowing Respondents to proceed with their counterclaims.Â  We disagree.[5]  \r\nOn the merits, Rule 41(c), SCRCP, allows the circuit court to dismiss an action, upon a partyâ€™s motion, for the other partyâ€™s failure to prosecute a counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim.Â  Crestwood Golf Club, Inc. v. Potter, 328 S.C. 201, 211, 493 S.E.2d 826, 832 (1997).Â  This courtâ€™s review of the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal or non-dismissal of a counterclaim for failure to prosecute is the same as review of dismissal or non-dismissal of plaintiffâ€™s cause of action. See Rule 41(c) (providing â€œ[t]he provisions of this rule apply to the dismissal of any counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim.â€).Â  Â Â \r\nWe find the circuit court did not commit an abuse of discretion in holding Respondentsâ€™ counterclaims remain viable.Â  In this case, Respondents have admittedly failed to take an assertive role in moving the case forward.Â  Undeniably, Respondents impeded discovery by failing to attend depositions in March 2001.Â  Also, Respondents failed to file a proposed order extending the time for discovery to 120 days as ordered by the court at the June 2001 hearing.Â  However, Respondents differ from Appellants in two respects.Â  First, Respondents did not fail to comply with a direct court order.Â  While the court ordered Respondents to file a proposed order extending discovery, the proposed order was contingent upon Appellantsâ€™ amended complaint as the whole purpose behind the proposed order was to allow new parties time to complete discovery; therefore the discovery order only needed to be filed after Appellantsâ€™ amended complaint.Â  Second, the onus of pushing for trial was on the Appellants and not the Respondents.Â  As this court stated in Don Shevey &amp; Spires, Inc. v. Am. Motors Realty Corp:Â  \r\n\r\nThe defendants, no less than the plaintiff, had the right . . . to press for trial; but the duty to do so was the plaintiffâ€™s, not theirs. Â While a defendant may bring about an expeditious trial of a case, he has no legal obligation to do so; except to meet such actions as are taken by the plaintiff, he may remain passive\r\n\r\n279 S.C. 58, 60, 301 S.E.2d 757, 759 (1983) (quoting Thomas &amp; Howard Co. v. Fowler, 238 S.C. 46, 52, 119 S.E.2d 97, 100 (1961)).Â  Thus, Respondents were within their right to â€œremain passiveâ€ in the intervening years.Â  Id.Â  Therefore, we find the record supports the circuit courtâ€™s holding that Respondents may proceed with their counterclaims.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the circuit court did not err in dismissing Appellantâ€™s case for failure to prosecute and allowing Respondentsâ€™ counterclaims to remain viable.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and BEATTY, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] In February 1998, Appellants, as individuals, originally filed this action in federal court.Â  The federal court dismissed the action for lack of personal jurisdiction.Â  \r\n[3] The court noted Respondents failed to appear at various depositions called by Appellants in March 2001, a time when Appellants were not represented by counsel.Â  \r\n[4] The Record on Appeal does not contain evidence that Appellant complied with the circuit courtâ€™s order to provide the documents and information requested by Respondents.Â  Medlock v. One 1985 Jeep Cherokee, 322 S.C. 127, 132, 470 S.E.2d 373, 376 (1996) (the appellant has the burden of presenting a record sufficient to allow the appellate court to make a decision).Â  \r\n[5] We note, despite Respondentsâ€™ contention, this issue is properly preserved.Â  Appellants preserved this issue because they argued Respondentsâ€™ counterclaims should be dismissed in their response to Appellantsâ€™ Motion to Dismiss, and the circuit court ruled upon the issue.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-133","title":"Thompson v.

Hembree, 364 S.C. 316, 320, 613 S.E.2d 533, 535 (2005).Â  â€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe master determined that Thompsonâ€™s judgment had priority over any lien asserted by Irma for two reasons, and this court can affirm on either or both grounds.Â  See Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000) (holding the decision to address any additional sustaining grounds is within the discretion of the appellate court).Â  \r\nFirst, Irma argues that the master failed to consider various rules of civil procedure and statutes in determining the family courtâ€™s order did not create a lien in her favor.Â  We disagree.Â  Irma relies on Rules 54 and 58 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure for the proposition that any order set forth by the court automatically constitutes a â€œjudgmentâ€ and that such judgment automatically becomes a lien on the debtorâ€™s real property pursuant to Section 15-35-810 of the South Carolina Code.Â  Rule 54 defines a judgment to include â€œany decree or order which dismisses the action as to any party or finally determines the rights of any party.â€Â  Rule 54(a), SCRCP.Â  Rule 58 states â€œthe clerk, unless the court otherwise orders, shall forthwith prepare, sign, and enter the judgment . . . .â€Â  Rule 58, SCRCP.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Section 15-35-810 (Rev. 2005) indicates that â€œfinal judgments and decrees entered in any court of record in this State . . . shall be declared to create a lien . . . .â€\r\nWhile the law is correctly cited by Irma, the order merely affirms the contractual arrangement between the parties that Richard will pay Irma $64,700.00.Â  It acknowledges the existence of the agreed-upon obligation, but does not go the additional step of concluding that the debt was due and unpaid giving rise to a judgment or lien.Â  Thompson, on the other hand, reduced the debt owed her by Richard to a money judgment.Â  She then went through the process of executing on the unsatisfied judgment.Â  Consequently, under the long-established law in this state, her judgment has priority over any claim Irma may have in the properties.Â  See King v. Fraser, 23 S.C. 543, 565 (1885) (â€œIt is certainly the general rule that a bona fide lien . . . has priority over all debts which are then unsecured . . . .â€) \r\nIrma also contends that the master lacked subject matter jurisdiction to declare an order of the family court void.Â  We affirm the masterâ€™s determination as an alternative sustaining ground.Â  The record shows that Richard was legally married to Vivian Russell during the great majority of the time he cohabitated with Irma.Â  This impediment would have prevented the parties from establishing a common law marriage during the term of the existing marriage, and their separation soon after the divorce makes proving the existence of a marriage much less likely.Â  See Johns v. Johns, 309 S.C. 199, 201-02, 420 S.E.2d 856, 858 (Ct. App. 1992) (â€œIn South Carolina, . . . [a] relationship illicit at its inception does not ripen into a common law marriage once\r\nthe impediment to marriage is removed. Instead, the law [in this State] presumes that the relationship retains its illicit character after removal of the impediment.â€) (internal citations omitted).Â  \r\nIrma could have attempted to show that the partiesâ€™ relationship became marital in nature after Richardâ€™s divorce from Vivian, but there is no evidence in the record before us to support such a determination.Â  See Yarbrough v. Yarbrough, 280 S.C. 546, 551, 314 S.E.2d 16, 19 (Ct. App. 1984) (holding that an agreement to enter a common law marriage after an impediment is removed may be established by the partiesâ€™ conduct).Â  \r\nWhere there is no marriage, the family court is without jurisdiction to make determinations regarding property.Â  See Hallums v. Bowens, 318 S.C. 1, 3, 428 S.E.2d 894, 895 (Ct. App. 1993) (â€œThe family courts of this state have jurisdiction to deal with family problems. It has no jurisdiction to settle property disputes between unmarried people.â€).\r\nFurthermore, the parties asked the master to determine the priority of the claims.Â  Irmaâ€™s claim was derived from a family court order.Â  To accomplish his assigned task, the master had to consider the nature and validity of Irmaâ€™s claim.Â  The master did not make a ruling about the division of â€œmaritalâ€ property.Â  Such a ruling is within the province of the family court.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(A)(2) (Supp. 2006).Â  The master considered the validity of an order allegedly giving rise to a lien in a dispute over the priority of claims.Â  Such a case clearly falls within the general class of questions the master is empowered to answer. Â See Rule 53, SCRCP (discussing the types of cases the master is empowered to hear). \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Richard Russell died after the institution of this litigation, and Irma was appointed personal representative of his estate.\r\n[2]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3]&nbsp; The master properly treated Irmaâ€™s claim as a motion for summary judgment, because the determination of the priority of the claims would be conclusive of the entire matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-134","title":"State v.

Savitz III, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Sabrina C. Todd, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Victor Salgado was convicted of criminal domestic violence, third or subsequent offense, and sentenced to thirty-three months in prison.[1]Â  He appeals, arguing the trial court erred in allowing the hearsay statements of his wife, who did not testify, into evidence.Â  We affirm.[2]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn September 16, 2002, a crying five-year-old girl appeared at the front door of Sergeant Jerry Millwood of the Spartanburg County Sheriffâ€™s Office.Â  Based on comments the child made to him, Sergeant Millwood called 911 to report a possible criminal domestic violence at the house next door.Â  Deputy Tanya Aldridge and Sergeant McKnight responded to the scene.Â  They were met at the door by Salgado, and he denied that his wife, Laura Salgado (the victim), was home.Â  Deputy Aldridge and Sergeant McKnight searched the residence and discovered broken and misplaced furniture, food on the walls, blood on the floor, and broken dishes.Â  The victim was discovered in a rear bedroom with a destroyed doorframe.Â  She had fresh wounds on her head and arm.Â  Sergeant McKnight spoke with the victim at the scene, and she was bleeding, upset, and crying.Â  Although she initially did not answer Sergeant McKnightâ€™s questions, the victim nodded her head affirmatively when Sergeant McKnight asked her whether â€œheâ€ did this to her.Â  Salgado was the only other adult in the house at the time.Â  The victim agreed to give a statement to Deputy Aldridge.Â  Sergeant Millwood assisted with taking pictures of the crime scene. Â Salgado was arrested for criminal domestic violence.Â Â  \r\nBy the time of the trial, the victim could not be located.Â  The State introduced the testimony of Sergeant Millwood, Deputy Aldridge, and Sergeant McKnight.Â  Over Salgadoâ€™s objections, Sergeant McKnight was allowed to testify that the victim identified Salgado as her assailant when she was asked whether â€œheâ€ did this to her.Â  Although the victimâ€™s written statement was not introduced, the photographs of the disarray in the house and of the victimâ€™s injuries were introduced at trial.Â  Salgado was convicted of criminal domestic violence, third or greater offense, and sentenced to thirty-three months.Â  He appeals. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSalgado argues the trial court erred by allowing into evidence the hearsay statement the victim gave to Sergeant McKnight identifying Salgado as her assailant.Â  He asserts that the victimâ€™s statement was not an â€œexcited utterance,â€ as the trial court found, because her answers to Sergeant McKnightâ€™s questions were not â€œspontaneous, but reluctant and the product of reflection.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nAlthough hearsay is generally not admissible at trial, an â€œexcited utteranceâ€ is an exception to the hearsay rule.Â  Rule 803(2), SCRE.Â  An excited utterance is a â€œstatement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.â€Â  Id. Â â€œThe rationale behind the excited utterance exception is that the startling event suspends the declarantâ€™s process of reflective thought, reducing the likelihood of fabrication.â€Â  State v. Sims, 348 S.C. 16, 20, 558 S.E.2d 518, 521 (2002).Â  For a statement to qualify as an excited utterance, three elements must be proven:Â  (1) the statement must relate to a startling event or condition; (2) the statement must have been made while the declarant was under the stress of the excitement; and (3) the stress of the excitement must have been caused by the startling event or condition.Â  Id. at 21, 558 S.E.2d at 521. \r\nCourts must consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether a statement falls within the excited utterance exception.Â  Id. at 23, 558 S.E.2d at 522. Â The burden of establishing facts which would qualify a statement as an excited utterance is upon the proponent of the evidence.Â  State v. Davis, 371 S.C. 170, 178-79, 638 S.E.2d 57, 62 (2006).Â  The determination of whether a statement is an excited utterance is a matter within the trial courtâ€™s discretion.Â  State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 43-44, 515 S.E.2d 525, 530 (1999).\r\nInitially, it is questionable whether this argument is preserved for review.Â  During Sergeant McKnightâ€™s testimony, Salgado objected to the introduction of the victimâ€™s statement as â€œhearsayâ€ in general.Â  After Salgado raised his objection, the State argued that the statement was an excited utterance, the court overruled the objection, and testimony resumed.Â  Although the court clearly found that the statement was an excited utterance, Salgado never argued to the trial court that the victimâ€™s statement was not an excited utterance because her answers were not spontaneous, were reluctant, and were the product of reflection.Â  Thus, the particular argument before us was never raised to the trial court and is not preserved for appellate review.Â  State v. Hicks, 330 S.C. 207, 216, 499 S.E.2d 209, 214 (1998) (holding that matters not raised to or ruled upon by the trial court are not preserved for appellate review).Â  \r\nIn any event, we find no merit to Salgadoâ€™s argument.Â  Testimony introduced at trial indicated that the house was in complete disarray, both Salgado and the victim were in the house together, and the victim was scared and bleeding from fresh wounds.Â  Suffering head and arm wounds during the destruction of the house was certainly a startling event.Â  The victim appeared to be still suffering from the stress of the event when the officers arrived at the scene.Â  Although the victim initially hesitated to speak with the officers, nothing in the record indicates that the initial hesitation was of such a duration as to allow the victim time for reflection.Â  Further, the testimony from both Deputy Aldridge and Sergeant McKnight was that the victim was still visibly upset and suffering from her wounds while still under the watchful eye of Salgado.Â  Considering the totality of the circumstances, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding the victimâ€™s act of nodding her head affirmatively when asked whether Salgado injured her was an excited utterance.[3]Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the totality of the circumstances, we find the trial court did not err in finding the victimâ€™s statement was an excited utterance.Â  Accordingly, Salgadoâ€™s conviction and sentence are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF, BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The South Carolina Department of Corrections website indicates that Salgado is not currently incarcerated.Â  \r\n[2]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3]Â  Although not raised by Salgado, the State correctly points out that nonverbal communication can qualify as an excited utterance.Â  State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 94-95, 544 S.E.2d 30, 34-35 (2001) (noting that a victimâ€™s nonverbal responses about her attacker as elicted by a nurse were excited utterances). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-135","title":"Newman v.

Newman, Trustee 17, (Landlord) brought suit against AFC Enterprises, Inc. (Tenant), alleging Tenant breached a commercial lease.Â  After the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, the court granted Landlordâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nW. Paschal Cochran owned the premises, the subject of this appeal, which included a building suitable for use as a restaurant.Â  Cochran entered into a lease (the original lease) with Franchise Enterprises for the use of the premises.Â  The original lease was scheduled to commence in 1986 with a â€œprimary termâ€ of fifteen years, ending in 2001.Â  The original lease granted to Franchise the right â€œto extend the primary term of the Lease for five (5) five-year periods.â€ Paragraph 28 of the original lease contains an option to terminate:\r\n\r\n[The tenant] shall have the right, at any time during any extension of the primary term to terminate this lease by paying to [the landlord] in cash the sum equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the unpaid portion of the rent to be paid for the remainder of such extension period. \r\n\r\nAfter the premises and lease changed hands, the lessee entered bankruptcy. Subsequently, Alta Cochran, the new landlord, and Pine Tree Foods, the new tenant, entered into an agreement to restate the terms of the lease.Â  Â Â The restated lease adopted the same terms and conditions as the original lease, with certain modifications. The restated lease contained the following provision:\r\n\r\nAmendment to Lease: The Lease is hereby amended as follows:\r\nThe Landlord, Alta G. Cochran, has agreed to furnish $60,000.00 in cash to do certain repairs at this location. . . . There will be no increase in rent.\r\nIn consideration of Landlord paying $60,000 for improvements Lessee agrees to extend the current primary lease for an additional five years with expiration of current primary lease being extended from March 31, 2001 to March 31, 2006.Â  \r\n\r\nThe restated lease, therefore, included the options to extend the lease and the right to terminate the lease found in the original lease.Â  The rent in the lease remained, as set by the original lease, at $62,490.60 per year plus 6% of sales over one million dollars per year. \r\nLandlord acquired the premises, subject to the restated lease, in 1996.Â  Â Â In 1998, Tenant and Landlord executed an estoppel letter to clarify the terms of the restated lease.Â  The estoppel letter stated:\r\n\r\nThe term of the Lease commenced on March 31, 1986, full rent is now accruing thereunder and the term of the Lease expires on March 31, 2006, subject to the exercise of any extension option[s] set forth in the Lease, which options shall remain effective upon the transfer or assignment of Tenantâ€™s interest in the Lease.Â  Tenant has four (4) consecutive unexercised options to extend the term of the Lease of five (5) years each on the same terms and conditions of the Lease. \r\n\r\nThe estoppel letter concluded:Â  â€œIn the event of a conflict between the terms of the Lease and this letter, the terms of this letter shall control.Â  Landlord understands that this letter shall serve as a material inducement for you to assume the obligations of Tenant under the Lease.â€ \r\nOn October 25, 2001, Tenant notified Landlord that Tenant was terminating the lease, effective October 31, 2001, pursuant to the terms of Paragraph 28 of the original lease. Tenant tendered a check in the amount of $69,000.04, which it stated represented twenty-five percent of the remainder of the rent for the term of the lease. The letter indicated Tenant sought to terminate the â€œcurrent lease term (April 1, 1986 through the expiration date of March 31, 2006).â€Â  \r\nLandlord rejected the proffered termination of the lease by letter dated November 16, 2001.Â  In the letter, Landlord indicated the termination was not accepted and Tenantâ€™s check was being deposited as November rent with credit given â€œagainst the $69,000.04 deposit for each monthly rental due as it accrues.â€Â  Landlord concluded:Â  â€œIt is my opinion that this lease is valid through March 31, 2006.â€Â  \r\nLandlord brought the underlying action, seeking damages resulting from Tenantâ€™s alleged breach of the lease. Tenant filed an answer asserting several defenses, including payment, waiver and estoppel, and the Statute of Frauds. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. \r\nThe court granted summary judgment in favor of Landlord, finding Tenant breached the terms of the lease.Â  The court found the restated lease did not operate as one of the options to extend, but instead created a new primary lease term which continued until March 31, 2006.Â  The court found Tenant could not terminate the lease pursuant to Paragraph 28 of the original lease because no option to extend the primary lease term had been exercised.Â  The court also found Tenantâ€™s defense of waiver and estoppel failed.Â  Accordingly, the court found in favor of Landlord on the issue of liability and ordered a non-jury trial on the issue of damages.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard which governs the trial court: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Baughman v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 115, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545 (1991).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Strother v. Lexington County Rec. Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, 61, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998).Â  On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party below.Â  Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nTenant maintains the trial court erred in finding it breached the lease by terminating it.Â  Tenant contends there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding the exercise of an extension and whether there was a meeting of the minds between Tenant and Landlord in the restatement of the lease and the execution of the estoppel letter.Â  Finally, Tenant asserts the court erred in improperly applying waiver and estoppel to the instant action.Â  We disagree.\r\nI.&nbsp; Right to Terminate\r\nTenant argues it had the right to terminate because the restated lease operated as an extension of the original lease and Paragraph 28 of the original lease allows for termination in the manner exercised.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn contract interpretation, courts are required is to ascertain and give legal effect to the intentions of the parties as expressed in the language of the contract.Â  United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 307 S.C. 102, 105, 413 S.E.2d 866, 868 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  If a contractâ€™s language is clear and capable of legal construction, this courtâ€™s function is to interpret its lawful meaning and the intent of the parties as found in the agreement.Â  Smith-Cooper v. Cooper, 344 S.C. 289, 295, 543 S.E.2d 271, 274 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nWhere the language used in a contract is clear and unambiguous, the court will be guided by the language of the contract, taken and understood in its plain, ordinary, and popular sense, to determine the contractâ€™s force and effect.Â  See Warner v. Weader, 280 S.C. 81, 83, 311 S.E.2d 78, 79 (1983); Sphere Drake Ins. Co. v. Litchfield, 313 S.C. 471, 473, 438 S.E.2d 275, 277 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  Courts do not have the authority to make new contracts for parties.Â  Rather, their duty is limited to interpretation of the contract made by parties, â€œregardless of its wisdom or folly, apparent unreasonableness, or failure to guard their rights carefully.â€ Â C.A.N. Enters., Inc. v. S.C. Health &amp; Human Servs. Fin. Commâ€™n, 296 S.C. 373, 378, 373 S.E.2d 584, 587 (1988).Â  \r\nTenant acknowledges that the original lease was terminated with the bankruptcy of a prior tenant, thus necessitating the restated lease.Â  The provisions of the restated lease make it clear that the terms of the original lease were being adopted by the parties, with the exception of any modified terms.Â  The principle provision modified was the term of the lease.Â  The parties to the restated lease negotiated a new term for the primary lease in consideration of the landlord paying up to $60,000.00 towards improvements on the premises. Based on the clear and unambiguous language of the restated lease, the parties intended the primary lease term to run until March 31, 2006, and not March 31, 2001, as stated in the original lease. \r\nIn addition, the estoppel letter drafted by Tenant and signed by Landlord states the term of the lease commenced on March 31, 1986 and ends March 31, 2006.Â  If the parties to the estoppel letter intended the restated lease provision to be construed as an extension of the original lease, they could have stated such in the estoppel letter.Â  However, the plain, unambiguous wording of the estoppel letter indicates the primary term of the lease expires on March 31, 2006.Â  Finally, the estoppel letter takes the additional step of clarifying:Â  â€œIn the event of a conflict between the terms of the Lease and this letter, the terms of this letter shall control.â€Â  Â Â \r\nAccordingly, based on the clear and unambiguous terms of the restated lease and the estoppel letter, Tenant was not operating â€œduring any extension of the primary term,â€ but was instead still operating during the primary term of the lease.Â  Therefore, under Paragraph 28, there is no genuine issue of fact whether Tenant had the right to terminate the lease prior to March 31, 2006.Â  As a result, the court properly determined Tenant breached the lease by failing to fully perform the provisions of the lease through March 31, 2006.\r\nII.&nbsp; Payment, Waiver, and Estoppel\r\nTenant contends the trial court erred in failing to find the payment of the termination fee constituted full payment under the terms of the restated lease.Â  In the alternative, Tenant maintains Landlord either waived his right to claim a breach of the lease or was estopped from claiming a breach of the lease.Â  We disagree.\r\nFirst, as discussed above, Tenant had no right to terminate the lease prior to March 31, 2006.Â  Therefore, Tenantâ€™s payment of one fourth of the remaining rents was not a proper termination of the lease and could not be considered full payment pursuant to the provisions of the restated lease and estoppel letter.\r\nNext, Tenant asserts Landlord waived his right to claim a breach of the lease by accepting Tenantâ€™s payment of the termination fee and depositing Tenantâ€™s check in the amount of $69,000.04.Â  Waiver is defined as â€œa voluntary and intentional abandonment or relinquishment of a known right.â€Â  Janasik v. Fairway Oaks Villas Horiz. Prop. Regime, 307 S.C. 339, 344, 415 S.E.2d 384, 387 (1992).\r\nâ€œGenerally, the party claiming waiver must show that the party against whom waiver is asserted possessed, at the time, actual or constructive knowledge of his rights or of all the material facts upon which they depended.â€Â  Id.Â  Whether a party is barred by estoppel or waiver can only be determined in light of the circumstances of each case.Â  See Id.\r\nIn the instant case, Tenant sent a letter to Landlord stating the $69,000.04 check was â€œfor payment of the termination fee.â€ Landlord responded by letter:\r\n\r\nI am this day depositing the $69,000.04 check which you sent me by letter . . . Not as recognition of it as a termination fee but in order to meet my November and future mortgage payments.Â  I do this because you have not sent the November rent payment and have indicated future monthly rental checks will not be forthcoming.\r\nIt is still my opinion that this lease is valid through March 31, 2006.Â  Until we can clear up this issue, I will give you credit against the $69,000.04 deposit for each monthly rental due as it accrues.Â  When you start back the monthly rentals, I will forward the remaining balance to you. \r\n\r\nTenant again wrote Landlord indicating it sought to terminate the lease, it would no longer be operating under the lease, and that the lease was â€œof no further force and effect.â€Â  Tenant did not seek a return of the money held by Landlord.Â  It simply reiterated its belief that the lease was properly terminated.\r\nUnder the circumstances of this case, we find no genuine issue of material fact indicating Landlord waived his right to claim Tenant breached the lease.Â  Landlord clearly indicated the reason he deposited the check was because he believed the lease to still be in effect and required monthly rental payments by Tenant.Â  All actions taken by Landlord, including the letter and the subsequent credits for monthly rents against the deposit, provide strong evidence that Landlord did not intend to waive his right to claim a breach of the lease by depositing the money.Â  Accordingly, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to Landlord because the retention of Tenantâ€™s check did not act as a waiver of Landlordâ€™s right to pursue additional damages from Tenant for breach of the lease.\r\nLastly, Tenant maintains Landlord should be estopped from asserting a breach of the lease based on Landlordâ€™s inaction in clarifying the provisions of the estoppel letter and in failing to immediately return the â€œtermination feeâ€ sent by Tenant.Â  Tenant points to Metromont Materials Corp. v. Pennell, which states:Â  â€œIt is a well recognized principle of equity â€˜that if a party is silent when he should speak, or supine when he should act, he will not afterwards be permitted to either speak when he should be silent, or to act when he failed to do so at the first proper and opportune moment.â€Â  270 S.C. 9, 22, 239 S.E.2d 753, 760 (1977) (citing King v. Ligon, 180 S.C. 224, 235, 185 S.E. 305, 309 (1936)).Â  In addition, this court has explained in great detail:\r\n\r\nUnder South Carolina law, the essential elements of estoppel are divided between the estopped party and the party claiming estoppel.Â  As to the estopped party, the essential elements are:Â  (1) conduct amounting to a false representation or concealment of material facts, or conduct calculated to convey the impression that the facts are otherwise than, and inconsistent with, the partyâ€™s subsequent assertions; (2) intention or expectation that such conduct be acted upon by the other party; and (3) actual or constructive knowledge of the real facts.Â  As to the party claiming estoppel, the essential elements are:Â  (1) lack of knowledge or the means of acquiring, with reasonable diligence, knowledge of the true facts; (2) reasonable reliance on the other partyâ€™s conduct; and (3) a prejudicial change in position.Â  Unlike waiver, the estopped party need not intend to relinquish or change any existing right for estoppel to arise.Â  The reliance by the party claiming estoppel must be reasonable, and it must proceed in good faith.Â  \r\nEstoppel by silence arises when the estopped party owes a duty to speak to the other party but refrains from doing so, thereby leading the other party to believe in an erroneous state of facts.Â  A â€œmanifest intentâ€ to mislead is not required for estoppel by silence; it arises when the silence is intended or has the effect of misleading the other party, provided the other party acts reasonably.Â  Estoppel may also arise when the estopped party fails to act at the â€œfirst proper and opportune moment.â€Â  \r\n\r\nProvident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Driver, 317 S.C. 471, 477-78, 451 S.E.2d 924, 928 (Ct. App. 1994) (internal citations omitted).Â Â  \r\nHowever, in this case, Landlord did speak at all available opportunities.Â  Landlord signed the estoppel letter drafted by Tenant purporting to explain the provisions of the lease.Â  Landlord understood, as we have found, that the estoppel letter did not allow termination prior to March 31, 2006, as was clearly stated in the estoppel letter.Â  In addition, Landlord immediately responded to Tenantâ€™s attempt to terminate the lease by writing a letter refusing to acknowledge the termination and insisting that the lease continued in effect.Â  Accordingly, there is no genuine issue of material fact indicating Landlord was estopped from arguing a breach of the lease by his inaction.Â  Therefore, summary judgment in favor of Landlord was proper.\r\nFurther, Landlord made no attempt to mislead Tenant, or to conceal any material facts regarding the lease, its terms, or Landlordâ€™s expectations.Â  Additionally, Landlord, in his letter, explained his decision regarding denying the termination of the lease and the negotiation of the $69,000.04 check to offset future damages.Â  As a result, we hold there is no evidence in the record indicating Landlord should be estopped from recovering for Tenantâ€™s breach of the lease.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Meeting of the Minds\r\nTenantâ€™s final argument is that there was no meeting of the minds in the estoppel letter due to the fact that the original lease provides for five extensions and the estoppel letter provides for only four extensions.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn order for a contract to be valid and enforceable, the parties must have a meeting of the minds as to all essential and material terms of the agreement.Â  Davis v. Greenwood Sch. Dist. 50, 365 S.C. 629, 634, 620 S.E.2d 65, 67 (2005); Player v. Chandler, 299 S.C. 101, 105, 382 S.E.2d 891, 893 (1989); see also Edens v. Laurel Hill, Inc., 271 S.C. 360, 364, 247 S.E.2d 434, 436 (1978) (â€œIt is well settled in South Carolina that in order for there to be a binding contract between parties, there must be a mutual manifestation of assent to the terms.â€)Â  The â€œmeeting of mindsâ€ required to make a contract valid is not based on a secret purpose or intention on the part of one of the parties, stored away in his mind and not brought to the attention of the other party, but must be based on a purpose and intention which has been made known or which, from all the circumstances, should be known.Â  Player, 299 S.C. at 105, 382 S.E.2d at 894.\r\nEven assuming, that the estoppel letter constitutes the contract between the parties, the terms of the estoppel letter are clear and unambiguous.Â  There is no suggestion that either party hid any intentions from the other party.Â  Both parties were presented a clear statement of the lease based on the terms of the estoppel letter.Â Â  As discussed above, Tenant in drafting the letter and Landlord in signing the letter acknowledged that the current term of the lease, as defined by the restated lease, extended from March 31, 1986 until March 31, 2006.Â  Both parties are bound by the expression of their intentions as reduced to writing in the estoppel letter.Â  Finally, the estoppel letter made it clear that it controlled on any provisions in conflict with the restated lease.Â  Therefore, based on the clear terms of the estoppel letter, we hold there is no issue of fact concerning whether there was a meeting of the minds between Landlord and Tenant on all material terms to the lease.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the terms of the restated lease, and the estoppel letter were clear and unambiguous.Â  We conclude based on the plain and ordinary meaning of the terms of the restated lease, and the estoppel letter, Tenant did not have authority to terminate the lease prior to March 31, 2006.Â  We further hold Tenant breached the lease by failing perform pursuant to its provisions through the end of the primary term of the lease, March 31, 2006.Â  We also hold the Landlord did not waive, nor was he estopped from asserting, his right to seek damages for Tenantâ€™s breach of the lease.Â  Finally, we hold there was a clear meeting of the minds in drafting and signing the estoppel letter and that both parties were properly bound by the terms of the estoppel letter and the restated lease.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY, WILLIAMS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
