Shupe,\r\n            both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Christopher Taft appeals the jury determination that he met the\r\nlegal definition of a sexually violent predator (SVP) under section 44-48-30 of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code (Supp. 2012). Taft argues the circuit court erred in (1)\r\ndenying his motions for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict\r\n(JNOV) and (2) granting the State's motion for continuance, which allowed the\r\n\nState to proceed with a second evaluation after the expiration of the ninety-day\r\nstatutory period. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1.     We agree with the circuit court's denial of Taft's motions for directed verdict\r\nand JNOV because the State presented evidence at trial that Taft met the definition\r\nof a SVP. See State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 555, 564 S.E.2d 87, 92-93 (2002)\r\n(\"[A] motion for JNOV may be granted only if no reasonable jury could have\r\nreached the challenged verdict.\"); In re Matthews, 345 S.C. 638, 646, 550 S.E.2d\r\n311, 315 (2001) (\"On an appeal from the [circuit] court's denial of a motion for a\r\ndirected verdict, the appellate court may only reverse the [circuit] court if there is\r\nno evidence to support the [circuit] court's ruling.\"). It is undisputed that Taft had\r\nbeen convicted of a sexually violent offense as defined by the Sexually Violent\r\nPredator Act. Further, while the evidence conflicts as to the type of pedophilia, it\r\nis undisputed that Taft suffers from the mental abnormality of \"pedophilia,\r\nsexually attracted to females.\" Therefore, the only question before the circuit court\r\nwas whether any evidence existed that Taft's mental abnormality makes him\r\n\"likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility for\r\nlong-term control, care, and treatment.\" See S.C. Code Ann. § 44-48-30(1) (Supp.\r\n2012) (defining SVP as \"a person who: (1) has been convicted of a sexually violent\r\noffense; and (2) suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that\r\nmakes the person likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a\r\nsecure facility for long-term control, care, and treatment\"); Matthews, 345 S.C. at\r\n647, 550 S.E.2d at 315 (\"In ruling on a motion for directed verdict, the [circuit]\r\ncourt is concerned with the existence of evidence, not its weight.\").\r\n\r\nWe find the State presented evidence at trial that Taft's pedophilia made him likely\r\nto engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility. Dr. Geoff\r\nMcKee testified Taft fell into a \"moderate to high risk\" of recidivism based upon\r\nseveral recidivism guides used to evaluate Taft during his 2009 evaluation. When\r\npresented with a hypothetical in which Taft had not been released into the general\r\ncommunity and had not been provided additional treatment or counseling while\r\nincarcerated, Dr. McKee testified that Taft's \"scores on the sexual recidivism\r\nguides would not change.\" Accordingly, we find that the circuit court properly\r\ndenied Taft's motions for directed verdict and JNOV.\r\n\r\n2.     As to Taft's second argument, we find the circuit court properly granted the\r\nState's request for a continuance to permit the State to proceed with a second\r\nevaluation. The SVP Act allows the circuit court to grant a continuance that would\r\npermit a trial to occur outside of the Act's ninety-day trial window. See S.C. Code\r\n\nAnn. § 44-48-90(B) (Supp. 2012) (\"[T]he court must schedule a trial before a jury\r\nin the county where the offense was committed within ninety days of the date the\r\ncourt appointed expert issues the evaluation as to whether the person is a sexually\r\nviolent predator . . . .\"); id. (\"The trial may be continued upon the request of either\r\nparty and a showing of good cause . . . and only if the respondent will not be\r\nsubstantially prejudiced.\"); In re Miller, 393 S.C. 248, 256-57, 713 S.E.2d 253,\r\n257 (2011) (noting that a motion for continuance in a SVP proceeding needs to be\r\nfiled prior to the expiration of the statutory period, but the circuit court is not\r\nrequired to rule on that motion within the statutory period).\r\n\r\nTaft argues the State failed to demonstrate \"good cause\" as required by section 44-\r\n48-90(B). We disagree. In requesting the continuance, the State explained that the\r\nexpert retained to conduct the second independent evaluation had experienced\r\ndelays due to a change in employment that resulted in relocating his laboratory\r\nfrom Columbia to Charleston. We find the circuit court properly exercised its\r\ndiscretion in finding that these unforeseen delays constituted \"good cause\" to grant\r\nthe continuance. See Miller, 393 S.C. at 257, 713 S.E.2d at 257 (finding \"good\r\ncause\" for a continuance existed when the State established \"unforeseeable delays\"\r\nincluding the fact that the court-appointed expert was the \"only . . . court-appointed\r\npsychiatrist employed to handle all of the SVP evaluations\" at the time); Plyler v.\r\nBurns, 373 S.C. 637, 650, 647 S.E.2d 188, 195 (2007) (\"The grant or denial of a\r\ncontinuance is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and is reviewable on\r\nappeal only when an abuse of discretion appears from the record.\"). Accordingly,\r\nwe find the circuit court properly granted the State a continuance to proceed with a\r\nsecond evaluation.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, WILLIAMS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-335","title":"State v.

Wukela, of Wukela Law Firm, of Florence, for\r\n            Appellant.\r\n\r\n            Grady Larry Beard and Ben Gibbs Leaphart, Jr., both of\r\n            Sowell Gray Stepp & Laffitte, LLC, of Columbia, for\r\n            Respondents.\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this workers' compensation appeal, Jeffery L. McFadden\r\nappeals the Workers' Compensation Commission Appellate Panel's (\"Appellate\r\nPanel\") order declining to impose sanctions against the City of Lake City and the\r\nSouth Carolina Municipal Insurance Trust (collectively, the \"City\") for the denial\r\n\nof medical care, pending investigation of a subsequent motor vehicle accident. In\r\naddition, McFadden appeals the Appellate Panel's assessment of costs against his\r\nattorney for a frivolous appeal. We dismiss in part and reverse in part.\r\n\r\n       As to McFadden's issues regarding the Appellate Panel's order affirming the\r\n1.\r\nsingle commissioner's order declining to impose sanctions against the City, we find\r\nthis order does not constitute a \"final decision\" as required by the Administrative\r\nProcedures Act (\"APA\") and, thus, is not immediately appealable. The APA\r\ngoverns review of decisions of the South Carolina Workers' Compensation\r\nCommission by the Court of Appeals. See S.C. Code Ann. §1-23-380 (Supp.\r\n2012); Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co., 360 S.C. 276, 288, 599 S.E.2d 604, 610 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2004). The APA allows \"[a] party who has exhausted all administrative\r\nremedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a final decision in a\r\ncontested case\" to appeal the agency's decision to the Court of Appeals. S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 1-23-380 (emphasis added). For an order to be final, it must \"dispose[] of\r\nthe whole subject matter of the action or terminate[] the particular proceeding or\r\naction, leaving nothing to be done but to enforce . . . what has already been\r\ndetermined.\" Charlotte-Mecklenburg Hosp. Auth. v. S.C. Dep't of Health & Envtl.\r\nControl, 387 S.C. 265, 267, 692 S.E.2d 894, 895 (2010). In the instant action, the\r\nAppellate Panel's order does not dispose of the whole subject matter of the action\r\nor terminate the action. Instead, the order merely affirms the single\r\ncommissioner's denial of McFadden's motion for sanctions and requires the parties\r\ncontinue with discovery. Accordingly, McFadden's appeal relating to the denial of\r\nsanctions against the City is dismissed.\r\n\r\n2.     As to McFadden's remaining issues regarding the assessment of hearing\r\ncosts against his attorney for a frivolous appeal, we reverse. The Appellate Panel's\r\norder requires that McFadden's \"attorney, not [McFadden], . . . pay the [cost of the\r\nhearing].\" The order relies on section 42-17-80 of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n2012) to assess this sanction. However, section 42-17-80 states: \"If the\r\nCommission . . . shall determine that such proceedings have been brought,\r\nprosecuted or defended without reasonable grounds, it may assess the whole cost\r\nof the proceedings upon the party who has brought or defended them.\" S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 42-17-80 (Supp. 2012) (emphasis added). Thus, the Appellate Panel lacks\r\nstatutory authority to impose this sanction upon McFadden's counsel. See Bazzle\r\nv. Huff, 319 S.C. 443, 445, 462 S.E.2d 273, 274 (1995) (\"An administrative agency\r\nhas only such powers as have been conferred by law and must act within the\r\nauthority granted for that purpose.\"). Accordingly, we reverse the assessment of\r\nhearing costs upon McFadden's attorney.\r\n\nBased on the foregoing, McFadden's appeal is\r\n\r\nDISMISSED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\n\r\nHUFF, WILLIAMS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-338","title":"State v.

Because a clear and convincing evidentiary standard \n\r\ngoverns fraudulent conveyance claims, the Staffords must submit more than a mere \n\r\nscintilla of evidence to withstand a motion for summary judgment. See Oskin v. \n\r\nJohnson, 400 S.C. 390, 396, 735 S.E.2d 459, 463 (2012) (\"A clear and convincing \n\r\nevidentiary standard governs fraudulent conveyance claims brought under the \n\r\nStatute of Elizabeth.\"); Hancock v. Mid-South Mgmt. Co., 381 S.C. 326, 330-31, \n\r\n673 S.E.2d 801, 803 (2009) (stating that in cases requiring a heightened burden of \n\r\nproof, the non-moving party must submit more than a mere scintilla of evidence to \n\r\nwithstand a motion for summary judgment). Even if the purchasers, the Prashads, \n\r\nwere charged with constructive knowledge of the Staffords' pending tort action \n\r\nagainst seller Jerry Yeager, the Staffords failed to establish the Prashads \n\r\nparticipated in any fraud. See McDaniel v. Allen, 265 S.C. 237, 243, 217 S.E.2d \n\r\n773, 776 (1975) (\"To annul for fraud a deed based upon a valuable consideration, it \n\r\nmust not only be shown that the grantor intended thereby to hinder, delay or \n\r\ndefraud creditors, but it must also appear that the grantee participated in such \n\r\nfraudulent purpose. Even if we were to assume that there is evidence of Mala fides \n\r\nin the grantor, yet if the sole purpose of the grantee was to secure her claims, \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1   S.C. Code Ann. § 27–23–10 (2007).\n\r\n2   S.C. Code Ann. §§ 39–5–10 to –560 (1985 & Supp. 2012). \n\r\n\nhaving no intent to hinder, delay or defeat other creditors, her title cannot be\r\naffected by the Mala fides of the grantor.\"); S.C. Nat'l. Bank v. Halter, 293 S.C.\r\n121, 133, 359 S.E.2d 74, 80 (Ct. App. 1987) (stating that to annul a mortgage that\r\nwas supported by a valuable consideration, it must be shown not only that the\r\nmortgagor intended to hinder, delay or defraud his creditors, but also that the\r\nmortgagee participated in the fraud); 37 Am. Jur. 2d Fraudulent Conveyances and\r\nTransfers § 15 (2013) (\"Knowledge of the purchaser at the time of his purchase\r\nthat a suit was pending against his seller does not necessarily establish a fraudulent\r\nintent on his part, and the adverse evidentiary effect thereof may be overcome by\r\nproof that the purchaser acted in good faith and paid a valuable consideration.\").\r\nThe Prashads paid the appraised value for the property. Satyanand Prashad\r\ntestified their purchase of the property was an arms-length transaction and he had\r\nno reason to believe that Yeager was trying to defraud the Staffords. We find the\r\nStaffords provided insufficient evidence the Prashads intended to aid Yeager in an\r\nalleged attempt to hinder, delay, or defraud the Staffords.\r\n\r\nWe find no error in the trial court's ruling the Law Firm had not breached a duty of\r\ncare to the Staffords. As the Staffords failed to prove a fraudulent conveyance, the\r\nLaw Firm could not be liable for assisting in a fraudulent conveyance. In addition,\r\nwe find the trial court did not err in holding the Law Firm did not owe a duty of\r\ncare to the Staffords to find and report their pending lawsuit against Yeager. See\r\nArgoe v. Three Rivers Behavioral Ctr. & Psychiatric Solutions, 388 S.C. 394, 400,\r\n697 S.E.2d 551, 554 (2010) (stating that generally an attorney is immune from\r\nliability to third persons arising from the performance of his professional activities\r\nas an attorney on behalf of and with the knowledge of his client and holding an\r\nattorney does not owe a duty to a non-client unless the attorney \"breaches some\r\nindependent duty to a third person or acts in his own personal interest, outside the\r\nscope of his representation of the client.\"); Rydde v. Morris, 381 S.C. 643, 650,\r\n675 S.E.2d 431, 435 (2009) (stating South Carolina law imposes a privity\r\nrequirement as a condition to maintaining a legal malpractice claim). In addition,\r\nwe disagree with the Staffords' assertion the Law Firm owed them a fiduciary duty\r\nbecause they were former clients of the firm. See Spence v. Wingate, 395 S.C. 148,\r\n160-162, 716 S.E.2d 920, 927-928 (2011) (stating the fiduciary duties created by\r\nan attorney-client relationship may be breached even though the formal\r\nrepresentation has ended and these duties include an obligation not to act in a\r\nmanner adverse to a former client's interest in matters substantially related to the\r\nprior representation) (emphasis added). The Law Firm represented the Staffords\r\nin the closing of their house. This closing was completely unrelated to their\r\nnuisance action against Yeager, for which the Staffords had separate counsel. The\r\n\nYeager/Prashad closing was not substantially related to the Law Firm's\r\nrepresentation of the Staffords during their closing.\r\n\r\nWe disagree with the Staffords' argument the trial court erred in granting summary\r\njudgment on their Unfair Trade Practices Act claim. See Columbia E. Assocs. v.\r\nBi–Lo, Inc., 299 S.C. 515, 522, 386 S.E.2d 259, 263 (Ct. App. 1989) (\"To be\r\nactionable under the [UTPA], an unfair or deceptive act or practice must have an\r\nimpact upon the public interest. The UTPA is not available to redress a private\r\nwrong when the public interest is unaffected.\"). We agree with the trial court that\r\nthe Staffords failed to provide evidence the Law Firm engaged in any misconduct\r\nand, therefore, failed to establish any unfair or deceptive act. We also agree with\r\nthe trial court that the Staffords' complaints arose from \"a particular and isolated\r\ntransaction not capable of repetition and not affecting the public interest.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, we find the trial court erred in granting the Law Firm's motions for\r\nsanctions against the Staffords and their attorney pursuant to the South Carolina\r\nFrivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act (the Act).3 See Father v. S.C. Dep't of\r\nSoc. Servs., 353 S.C. 254, 260, 578 S.E.2d 11, 14 (2003) (stating the decision\r\nwhether to award sanctions under the Act is a matter in equity, entitling the\r\nappellate court to take its own view of the preponderance of the evidence); Ex\r\nparte Gregory, 378 S.C. 430, 437, 663 S.E.2d 46, 50 (2008) (stating where the\r\nappellate court agrees with the trial court's findings of fact, it reviews the decision\r\nto award sanctions, as well as the terms of those sanctions, under an abuse of\r\ndiscretion standard); Se. Site Prep, LLC v. Atl. Coast Builders & Contractors, LLC,\r\n394 S.C. 97, 105, 713 S.E.2d 650, 654 (Ct. App. 2011) (stating the revisions to the\r\nAct created a \"reasonable attorney\" standard to determine whether sanctions are\r\nwarranted). Although the trial court declined to impose sanctions for the initial\r\nassertion of the claim for professional negligence, it held the Staffords should have\r\ndismissed their claim after conducting discovery. However, the Staffords' legal\r\ntheories concerning the Law Firm's liability remained the same throughout the\r\nlitigation and they submitted two affidavits from their expert witness in support of\r\ntheir claims. While we find the trial court did not err in granting summary\r\njudgment on the Staffords' claims, we do not believe the Staffords' pursuit of their\r\nclaims warranted sanctions under the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3   S.C. Code Ann. § 15-36-10 (Supp. 2012).\r\n\nAccordingly, the trial court's grant of summary judgment on all of the Staffords'\r\nclaims is affirmed. Its award of sanctions is reversed.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\n\r\nHUFF, THOMAS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-341","title":"SCDSS v.

The family court found the South Carolina Department of Social\r\nServices (DSS) did not establish by clear and convincing evidence any statutory\r\ngrounds for termination of parental rights (TPR) and found TPR was not in Child's\r\nbest interest. On appeal, the Does argue the family court erred in finding TPR was\r\nnot in Child's best interest. We affirm.\r\n\r\nOn appeal from the family court, this court reviews factual and legal issues de\r\nnovo. Argabright v. Argabright, 398 S.C. 176, 179, 727 S.E.2d 748, 750 (2012).\r\nAn appealed order comes to the appellate court with a presumption of correctness,\r\nand the appellant bears the burden to demonstrate the family court committed\r\nreversible error. Honea v. Honea, 292 S.C. 456, 458, 357 S.E.2d 191, 192 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1987).\r\n\r\nThe grounds for TPR must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. S.C. Dep't\r\nof Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\n\"Upon review, the appellate court may make its own finding from the record as to\r\nwhether clear and convincing evidence supports [TPR].\" S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs.\r\nv. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 609, 582 S.E.2d 419, 423 (2003). However, despite our\r\nbroad scope of review, this court is not required to ignore the fact the family court,\r\nwhich saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their\r\ncredibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony. Lewis v. Lewis, 392\r\nS.C. 381, 388, 709 S.E.2d 650, 653 (2011). The family court may order TPR upon\r\nfinding one or more of eleven statutory grounds is met and finding TPR is in the\r\n\nchild's best interests. S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2570 (2010 & Supp. 2012). \"In a\r\nTPR case, the best interest of the child is the paramount consideration.\"\r\nCharleston Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Jackson, 368 S.C. 87, 95, 627 S.E.2d 765,\r\n770 (Ct. App. 2006). \"The interests of the child shall prevail if the child's interest\r\nand the parental rights conflict.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2620 (2010).\r\n\r\nAt the TPR hearing, DSS alleged three grounds for TPR: (1) Child had lived\r\noutside Mother's home for six months and Mother willfully failed to support Child\r\npursuant to section 63-7-2570(4) of the South Carolina Code (2010); (2) Mother\r\nfailed to remedy the conditions that caused the removal of Child as required by\r\nsection 63-7-2570(2); and (3) Child was in foster care for fifteen of the most recent\r\ntwenty-two months as provided in section 63-7-2570(8). The family court found\r\nDSS failed to prove any of these statutory grounds by clear and convincing\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nHaving conducted a de novo review of the record, we affirm the family court's\r\nfinding that DSS failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence any statutory\r\ngrounds for TPR. See S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Sarah W., 402 S.C. 324, 335,\r\n741 S.E.2d 739, 745 (2013) (\"[W]hen DSS seeks TPR pursuant to section 63-7-\r\n2570, the allegations supporting that termination must be proved by clear and\r\nconvincing evidence.\").\r\n\r\nThe record does not contain clear and convincing evidence Mother willfully failed\r\nto support Child. Two DSS caseworkers testified Mother supported Child with\r\nmoney and in-kind support throughout Child's stay in foster care. Mother did not\r\ngo six consecutive months without paying support in some manner and by some\r\nmeans. Additionally, the evidence shows Mother's extensive counseling and drug\r\ntreatment prevented her from overcoming her financial burdens. Therefore, the\r\nfamily court correctly found Mother did not willfully fail to provide support.\r\n\r\nThe record also does not contain clear and convincing evidence Mother failed to\r\nremedy the conditions that caused the removal of Child. A review of the record\r\nconfirms Mother successfully completed her treatment plan. See S.C. Dep't of Soc.\r\nServs. v. Mother, 396 S.C. 390, 402, 720 S.E.2d 920, 926 (Ct. App. 2011) (noting\r\nthe importance of the mother's successful completion of an intensive drug\r\ntreatment plan). Mother completed her required drug counseling and parenting\r\nclasses. Additionally, Mother consistently tested drug-free for the two years prior\r\nto the TPR hearing. Importantly, Mother regularly attends Narcotics Anonymous\r\nmeetings and remains in contact with her Narcotics Anonymous sponsor. Mother\r\n\nalso has an acceptable home with her husband, who has a stable job and earns\r\nsufficient money to support the family. Therefore, the family court correctly found\r\nMother remedied the conditions that caused Child's removal.\r\n\r\nAlthough Child was in foster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two\r\nmonths, the majority of this time was attributable to procedural delays not caused\r\nby Mother. Cumulatively, the procedural delays in the case totaled more than two\r\nyears. See Sarah W., 402 S.C. at 336, 741 S.E.2d at 745-46 (recognizing when\r\nsubstantial evidence shows much of the delay is attributable to the acts of others, a\r\nparent's rights should not be terminated based solely on the fact the child has spent\r\ngreater than fifteen months in foster care). Therefore, Mother's parental rights\r\nshould not be terminated on this ground.\r\n\r\nBecause we find DSS failed to prove any of the statutory grounds for TPR, we\r\nneed not address whether TPR is in Child's best interest. See Futch v. McAllister\r\nTowing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999)\r\n(providing this court need not review remaining issues on appeal when its\r\ndetermination of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.1\r\n\r\nHUFF, WILLIAMS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1   We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-340","title":"Griswold v.

Wife presented the court with an affidavit from Dr.\r\nBenjamin Levinson, her primary care manager, in which he stated Wife would not\r\nbe able to attend the hearing because she had a scheduled oncology appointment\r\nand chemotherapy treatment in Charleston. Dr. Levinson explained:\r\n\"Chemotherapy is administered in cycles for maximum benefit and it is imperative\r\nthat [Wife] maintain her cycle schedule.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, we find Wife was not prejudiced by the family court's denial of her\r\nrequest for a continuance. See Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Laura D., 386 S.C. 382, 385,\r\n688 S.E.2d 130, 132 (Ct.

In the Final Order of\r\nSeparate Support and Maintenance filed June 14, 2010, the family court\r\ndetermined all financial issues, leaving only the issue of the divorce for a future\r\ndate. In that order, the family court found the date of separation was May 16,\r\n2009.

Cheatham, of Lexington, for Appellant.\r\n\r\n           Bryan D. Caskey and C. Cantzon Foster, II, both of\r\n           Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Dawn M. Pontious appeals two post-trial orders issued in a\r\npartition action. We affirm.\r\n\nPontious purchased the subject property with Respondents Diana L. Winters\r\n(Diana) and Jason R. Winters (Jason). On March 7, 2006, Pontious filed this\r\naction for a partition of the property.1 On November 3, 2008, the trial court heard\r\nthe matter without a jury. On November 25, 2008, the court issued an order\r\ndirecting Diana to convey her interest in the property to Jason and Pontious in\r\nequal shares. In the order, the court also noted that although Pontious and Jason\r\nhad \"unofficially\" divided the property into two \"halves,\" they did not have an\r\nagreement as to the exact physical division of the property.\r\n\r\nBased on the trial testimony, the court found the road frontage included a ditch that\r\nbegan at the northernmost boundary and ran along the frontage in a southeasterly\r\ndirection for an unknown distance, leaving \"an as yet undetermined amount of road\r\nfrontage from the end of the ditch to the iron pin located at the southeasternmost\r\npoint of the road.\" The court concluded that granting Pontious and Jason equal\r\namounts of road frontage would be inequitable for Jason because the ditch would\r\ntake up most of the frontage allocated to the portion of the property that he was to\r\nreceive in the partition.\r\n\r\nBecause of these uncertainties, the trial court \"acknowledge[d] it will likely be\r\nnecessary for a new survey to be obtained\" and ordered Pontious and Jason to bear\r\nthe cost equally.2 The court then ordered that the subject property \"be partitioned\r\nin the manner set forth as between Jason R. Winters and Dawn M. Pontious.\" Both\r\nPontious and Jason were to execute deeds accomplishing the ordered partition and\r\n\r\n1 Pontious also sought to quiet title and alleged a conspiracy. The record does not\r\ngive the particulars of either of these causes of action. Diana counterclaimed for\r\ncollection of a debt, and Jason counterclaimed for partition. The trial court entered\r\njudgment for Jason and Diana on Pontious's conspiracy claim and did not\r\nspecifically address the quiet title cause of action. Diana was also awarded a\r\njudgment of $1,960.02 on her counterclaim against Pontious. None of these\r\ndispositions have been appealed.\r\n2 The record on appeal includes a plat of the subject property that was part of a\r\n1968 survey. The plat, however, appears to have been included as an exhibit for a\r\nsurveyor's deposition, which is discussed later in this opinion and did not occur\r\nuntil more than one year after the partition hearing. The record does not include a\r\ntranscript of the partition hearing or specific information about any surveys\r\nadmitted during that hearing.\r\n\nto share the costs of preparing and recording the deeds and survey. Pontious\r\nmoved for reconsideration of the order. Reconsideration was denied, and no\r\nappeal followed.\r\n\r\nOn July 10, 2009, Pontious filed a motion for court approval of a plat showing how\r\nshe proposed to divide the subject property. Jason opposed the motion and\r\nsubmitted a plat depicting his own proposed property division. The court held a\r\nhearing in the matter on September 22, 2009, and issued an order on October 2,\r\n2009, in which it found a survey was needed and appointed a surveyor to complete\r\nthis task. The record does not indicate whether or not the parties were to be\r\nnotified when the survey was submitted to the court. In any event, on December 9,\r\n2009, without prior notice to the parties, the court issued an order stating the\r\nsurvey was completed and \"deemed by this Court to be an accurate reflection of\r\nthe property ownership in this case.\" Accordingly, the court directed counsel to\r\nuse the survey to prepare the partition deeds. The approved survey allotted\r\nPontious less acreage than what was allotted to Jason and only twenty feet of road\r\nfrontage, the minimum amount of frontage that was allowed by the county.\r\n\r\nPontious filed various motions to have the survey set aside. First, on December 11,\r\n2009, she filed a motion to \"disapprove\" the survey. On December 15, 2009, she\r\nmoved under Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to alter or amend the order of December 9,\r\n2009, in which the court approved the survey. While these motions were pending,\r\nthe surveyor gave a deposition on April 20, 2010, in which he stated there was no\r\nditch on the road frontage of the subject property; rather, there was a \"water\r\nturnout\" that did not interfere with access. He also testified that there was a ditch\r\nalong the northeastern edge of the property, but it was entirely off the property and\r\nnot along the road frontage. The surveyor further stated he discussed his proposed\r\nsurvey with the trial court while it was in progress and proceeded with the court's\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nOn June 25, 2010, Pontious moved under Rule 60(b), SCRCP, for relief from the\r\norder of December 9, 2009, arguing the surveyor's statements in his deposition\r\nprovided a \"meritorious defense\" to the approved survey.\r\n\r\nPontious's motion to alter and amend was denied on July 30, 2010, and she filed a\r\nnotice of appeal from this order. Her Rule 60(b) motion was heard on two separate\r\ndays, and the trial court issued an order on October 28, 2010, denying relief. On\r\nNovember 19, 2010, Pontious moved for relief from the order of October 28, 2010,\r\n\nrequesting reconsideration or a new hearing on the matter. The court denied relief\r\non November 29, 2010, and Pontious appeals this order as well.3\r\n\r\n1.     We disagree with Pontious's first argument that she was deprived of her due\r\nprocess rights because the trial court approved the survey without giving her an\r\nopportunity to be heard. Although Pontious was not consulted before the trial\r\ncourt approved the survey, the subsequent hearings on her Rule 60(b) motion were\r\nsufficient to satisfy her due process rights. As the trial court acknowledged in its\r\norder in Pontious's Rule 60(b) motion, while the motion was pending, Pontious\r\nproffered a deposition given by the surveyor on April 30, 2010, and has not\r\nidentified any other evidence that she was prevented from offering to support her\r\nposition. See Sloan v. South Carolina Bd. of Physical Therapy Exam'rs, 370 S.C.\r\n452, 485, 636 S.E.2d 598, 615 (2006) (\"Procedural due process requirements are\r\nnot technical; no particular form of procedure is necessary.\"); cf. Ross v. Med.\r\nUniv. of South Carolina, 328 S.C. 51, 67, 492 S.E.2d 61, 71 (1997) (holding that\r\nalthough pre-termination procedures for a tenured professor to respond to charges\r\nof misconduct did not comply with minimum due process, the error was\r\nremediated by his full and meaningful participation in a post-termination hearing).\r\n\r\n2.     We find no merit in Pontious's argument that the orders of December 9,\r\n2009, and October 28, 2010, should be reversed because they contain \"factual\r\nconclusions\" that were \"without evidentiary support.\" Contrary to what Pontious\r\nargues in her brief, the order of December 9, 2009, did not include a finding that\r\nthe survey approved by the court was consistent with the order issued after the\r\npartition action was heard. Rather, the court found: \"The survey is deemed by this\r\nCourt to be an accurate reflection of the property ownership in this case.\" As\r\nevident from the surveyor's deposition testimony, the court was informed about the\r\ndiscrepancy between its earlier finding that a ditch was on the road frontage and\r\nthe surveyor's observation that there was no ditch at that location. Nevertheless,\r\ndespite the requirement that the survey be consistent with a prior order and the\r\nrealization that fulfillment of this condition may not be possible, the trial court\r\nopted to approve the survey based on a determination that it accurately reflected\r\n\"the property ownership.\" Moreover, the surveyor was unable to divide the\r\nproperty according to the November 28, 2008 order because of an inaccurate\r\nfinding in that order that could have been avoided if the parties had followed the\r\n\r\n3We were unable to ascertain from the record whether an order was issued\r\nspecifically addressing Pontious's motion of December 11, 2009, to have the\r\nsurvey disapproved by the court.\r\n\ntrial court's advice and obtained a survey when the partition action was tried. See\r\nErickson v. Jones Street Publishers, LLC, 368 S.C. 444, 476, 629 S.E.2d 653, 670\r\n(2006) (\"[A] party may not complain on appeal of error or object to a trial\r\nprocedure which his own conduct has induced.\").\r\n\r\nThe factual conclusions in the October 28, 2010 order that Pontious appears to\r\nchallenge concern whether she satisfied the due diligence requirement for relief\r\nunder Rule 60(b)(2), SCRCP. She contends the court's conclusions that the parties\r\nshould have procured a survey or called a surveyor to testify at trial were\r\nspeculative statements about how the proceedings would have resulted had these\r\nsteps been taken. As the moving party, however, Pontious had the burden of\r\npresenting evidence proving the facts essential to entitle her to relief under Rule\r\n60(b). BB&T v. Taylor, 369 S.C. 548, 552, 633 S.E.2d 501, 503 (2006) (citing\r\nBowers v. Bowers, 304 S.C. 65, 67, 403 S.E.2d 127, 129 (Ct. App. 1991)). We\r\nhave found no evidence of due diligence on Pontious's part, such as evidence\r\ndemonstrating that circumstances beyond her control prevented her from having\r\nthe property surveyed or calling a surveyor to testify at trial. Furthermore, there is\r\nno evidence in the record as to whether or not the partition action would have been\r\ndecided differently if these measures had been taken. Finally, Pontious did not\r\nappeal the order in which the trial court initially found a ditch encumbered the road\r\nfrontage.\r\n\r\n3.     Pontious further requests that we make our own findings of fact in this\r\nequitable matter; however, we decline to disturb the trial court's rulings. See Oskin\r\nv. Johnson, 400 S.C. 390, 397, 735 S.E.2d 459, 463 (2012) (acknowledging \"the\r\nappellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own view of the\r\npreponderance of the evidence,\" but further stating the court \"is not required to\r\ndisregard the findings of fact by the trial court\"). Here, we cannot fault either of\r\nthe two circuit court judges who presided during this litigation for declining to\r\nentertain Pontious's belated challenge to the finding that a ditch ran along the road\r\nfrontage. As noted earlier, Pontious did not appeal the first order in which the trial\r\ncourt made this finding, and we see no reason to disturb the trial court's refusal to\r\nalter or amend its rulings based on this alleged error. See Collins v. Sigmon, 299\r\nS.C. 464, 468, 385 S.E.2d 835, 837 (1989) (applying the maxim that \"equity aids\r\nthe vigilant and diligent\").\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, THOMAS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-292","title":"JP Morgan Chase Bank v.
