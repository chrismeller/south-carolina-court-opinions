(&quot;Westvaco&quot;)\r\n  appeals the circuit court's affirmance of the South Carolina Workers'\r\n  Compensation Commission's order finding Westvaco liable to Galen Polite's\r\n  health insurance company, Blue Cross/Blue Shield (&quot;Blue Cross&quot;) in\r\n  the amount of $92,961.39 for previously paid medical treatment.Â  On appeal,\r\n  Westvaco argues: (1) Polite's workers' compensation claim for reimbursement\r\n  should be extinguished by his death; (2) the claim for reimbursement should\r\n  have been dismissed because substitution of the parties was not sought within a\r\n  reasonable time following his death; (3) the Commission's conclusion is not\r\n  supported by substantial evidence in the record; and (4) the Commission does\r\n  not have jurisdiction over claims for reimbursement made by or on behalf of\r\n  health insurance companies.Â  Finding the Commission without the authority to\r\n  order reimbursement to an insured's private health insurance carrier, we\r\n  reverse the circuit court's order.Â  \r\nCounsel for Polite argues there is no\r\n  need to appoint a personal representative or substitute the estate as the\r\n  proper party following Polite's death because &quot;[n]o benefits are going to\r\n  be paid directly to the Respondent or any of his dependents or family\r\n  members&quot; and there would be no funds for that person to manage.Â  Via his\r\n  own admission, counsel admits that he is not representing Polite.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  find the real party in interest in this appeal is Blue Cross who, as the\r\n  claimant's private health insurance carrier, lacks standing in front of the\r\n  Commission. Â Accordingly,\r\n  we reverse pursuant to Rule 220(b)(2), SCACR, and the following authorities: Blue\r\n    Cross &amp; Blue Shield v. S.C. Indus. Comm'n, 274 S.C. 204, 206-08, 262\r\n  S.E.2d 35, 37 (1980) (finding Blue Cross lacked standing to participate in the\r\n  workers' compensation proceedings after filing a declaratory judgment action to\r\n  determine whether it had the right to participate in proceedings where the\r\n  employee held one of its policies);[1] S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-1301 to -1305 (Supp. 2009) (only providing payment for\r\n  medical treatment, other than to the employee, to a &quot;medical provider&quot;\r\n  or &quot;medical practitioner&quot;); James v.

(collectively\r\n  Children), pursuant to section 63-7-20 of the South Carolina Code (2008); (2)\r\n  he used excessive corporal punishment on C.D.; and (3) the Department of Social\r\n  Services (DSS) made reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for\r\n  removal.Â  We affirm.Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nDSS first became involved in\r\n  this case on March 30, 2007, when allegations arose that Father excessively\r\n  bruised C.D.'s buttocks as a result of a spanking.Â  Thereafter, Children were\r\n  taken into emergency protective custody and DSS placed Children with Helping\r\n  Hands.Â  After a probable cause hearing, the family court issued an order\r\n  instructing DSS to retain custody of Children.Â Â   Â \r\nOn June 25, 2007, July 11,\r\n  2007, and July 25, 2007, the family court conducted a merits hearing.Â  At the\r\n  hearing, Angela Holtzclaw, C.D.'s school nurse, testified that when C.D. came\r\n  to school on March 30, 2007, C.D. complained she was unable to sit.Â  According\r\n  to Holtzclaw, C.D. told her she could not sit down because &quot;her daddy had\r\n  given her a really bad spanking.&quot;Â  When Holtzclaw asked if this had\r\n  happened before, C.D. responded, &quot;yes, but it had been a while.&quot;Â \r\n  Holtzclaw then requested Assistant Principal Valerie Anna Neal's presence when\r\n  she examined C.D.Â  The school librarian then took pictures of the bruises on\r\n  C.D.'s buttocks and Neal contacted DSS and law enforcement.Â  \r\nHoltzclaw opined C.D.'s\r\n  bruises were not the result of &quot;a bad spanking,&quot; but rather &quot;a\r\n  beating.&quot;Â  According to Neal, once DSS arrived, C.D. &quot;was trembling.Â \r\n  And I asked her why she was trembling, and she said she was afraid to go home .\r\n  . . because my dad is going to kill me if I go home today.&quot;Â  Neal\r\n  testified &quot;it was obvious that [C.D.] had been hurt terribly by a parent.Â \r\n  And I can't say she told me that, but I know that this occurred.&quot;Â \r\n  According to Neal, C.D.'s buttocks were &quot;purple and black and blue, [and] C.D.\r\n  was in terrible pain and could not sit.&quot;Â  According to Neal, C.D.\r\n  expressed concern over M.D.'s safety.Â  \r\nWhen DSS employee Susan\r\n  Leverette arrived at the school, C.D. told her the bruises were the result of a\r\n  spanking.Â  According to Leverette, M.D. was relieved when he learned he was not\r\n  going home.Â  Leverette testified Father denied bruising C.D.; however, he later\r\n  admitted he spanked C.D.Â  Leverette acknowledged both Father and C.D. stated C.D.\r\n  had been in a bike accident the previous day, but Leverette did not believe the\r\n  bruising was consistent with a bike accident.Â  Rather, Leverette believed C.D.'s\r\n  bruises were the result of excessive corporal punishment and, as a result, DSS\r\n  sought a finding that Father physically abused C.D.Â  Additionally, Charie\r\n  Jenkins, a child protective services investigator, believed C.D.'s bruises were\r\n  the result of excessive corporal punishment.Â  \r\nBrent Simpson of the Anderson\r\n  County Sheriff's Department decided to place Children into emergency protective\r\n  custody based on C.D.'s statements and bruises.Â  Simpson believed M.D. and L.D.\r\n  were also in danger.Â  \r\nFather admitted he spanked\r\n  Children as a form of discipline; however, he did not believe a spanking caused\r\n  C.D.'s bruises.Â  According to Father, on March 29, 2007, C.D. and a friend were\r\n  riding bikes and C.D. had an accident.Â  That same evening, Father spoke to C.D.\r\n  about deceiving him regarding permission to have a friend over.Â  Based on her\r\n  deception, Father spanked C.D.Â  According to Father, he gave C.D. &quot;three\r\n  licks with a paddle.&quot;Â  Â Father opined &quot;there is no way I put them\r\n  bruises on her, and if by any chance I caused any of those bruises I'm\r\n  sorry.&quot;Â  \r\nOn March 1, 2008, the family\r\n  court issued a removal order transferring custody of Children to DSS.Â  Specifically,\r\n  the family court found (1) Father abused and/or neglected Children pursuant to\r\n  section 63-7-20 of the South Carolina Code (2008); (2) Father used excessive\r\n  corporal punishment on C.D.; and (3) DSS made reasonable efforts to prevent or\r\n  eliminate the need for removal.Â  Father filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion,\r\n  which the family court denied.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family\r\n  court, this court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence.Â  Nasser-Moghaddassi v. Moghaddassi, 364\r\n  S.C. 182, 189-90, 612 S.E.2d 707, 711 (Ct. App. 2005); see also Florence\r\n    County Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Ward,&nbsp; 310 S.C. 69, 71, 425 S.E.2d 61,\r\n  62&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1992) (&quot;When physical abuse of a child is alleged, this\r\n  [c]ourt is free to find facts based on its own view of the preponderance of\r\n  evidence.&quot;).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to\r\n  disregard the family court's findings.Â  Bowers v.\r\n    Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Nor must we\r\n  ignore the fact that the family court, which saw and heard the witnesses, was\r\n  in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative\r\n  weight to their testimony. Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 526, 280\r\n  S.E.2d 541, 542 (1981).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Excessive\r\n  Corporal Punishment\r\nFather contends the family\r\n  court erred in finding Father used excessive corporal punishment on C.D. and as\r\n  a result erred in removing C.D. from Father's custody.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nChild abuse\r\n  occurs when a parent &quot;inflicts or allows to be inflicted upon the child\r\n  physical . . . injury . . . sustained as result of excessive corporal\r\n  punishment.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-20(4)(a)\r\n  (2008).Â  However, physical discipline is not corporal punishment if it (1) is administered by a parent; (2) is perpetrated\r\n  for the sole purpose of restraining or correcting the child; (3) is reasonable\r\n  in manner and moderate in degree; (4) has not brought about permanent or\r\n  lasting damage to the child; and (5) is not reckless or grossly negligent\r\n  behavior by the parents.Â  Â§ 63-7-20(4)(a)(i)-(v).Â  \r\nEvidence presented at the\r\n  merits hearing indicated Father's use of physical discipline was not reasonable\r\n  in manner or moderate in degree.Â  Â Neal, Holtzclaw, Leverette, Jenkins, and\r\n  Simpkins all testified the bruising on C.D.'s buttocks was excessive.Â \r\n  Additionally, C.D. informed school personnel she was unable to sit because of\r\n  the spanking.Â  Further, the photographs entered into evidence revealed numerous\r\n  and significant bruises, and the bruises were inconsistent with bruising from\r\n  the bike accident.Â  Accordingly, we find the evidence supports the family\r\n  court's conclusion Father used excessive corporal punishment on C.D.[1]Â  \r\nII.Â  Failure\r\n  to Return M.D. and L.D.\r\nFather argues the family\r\n  court erred in failing to return M.D. and L.D. to Father's custody.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nIn cases involving excessive\r\n  corporal punishment, if one child is taken into emergency protective custody and\r\n  the only injury to the child is &quot;external lesions or minor bruises,&quot;\r\n  other children in the home shall not be taken into emergency protective custody.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-620(A)(1) (2008).Â \r\n  However, this statute only prohibits law enforcement from removing other\r\n  children in a home if the bruises on one child are minor.Â  Based on the evidence\r\n  presented to the family court, C.D.'s bruises were not minor.Â  Â Rather,\r\n  evidence indicated C.D. had numerous and significant bruises.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  find the family court did not err in concluding M.D. and L.D. should not be\r\n  returned to Father's custody.Â Â  \r\nIII.Â  Efforts\r\n  to Prevent or Eliminate Removal\r\nFather contends the family\r\n  court erred in finding DSS made reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the\r\n  need for removal of Children.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen a family court removes a\r\n  child, the family court's order &quot;shall contain a finding by the court of\r\n  whether reasonable efforts were made by [DSS] to prevent removal of the child\r\n  and a finding of whether continuation of the child in the home would be\r\n  contrary to the welfare of the child.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-1660(G)\r\n  (2008).Â  When DSS's first contact with a child occurs &quot;under such\r\n  circumstances that reasonable services would not have allowed the child to\r\n  remain safely in the home, the court shall find that removal of the child without\r\n  services or without further services was reasonable.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-1660(G)(4) (2008).Â  Â Â \r\nDSS's first contact with Children\r\n  occurred when C.D. told school personnel Father spanked her.Â  Based upon the\r\n  severity of the bruising and C.D.'s statements, law enforcement took Children\r\n  into emergency protective custody because law enforcement did not believe\r\n  Children could remain safely in the home. Because probable cause existed to\r\n  place Children in emergency protective custody, the family court did not err in\r\n  concluding Children could not remain safely in the home.[2]Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we\r\n  find the family court did not err in finding (1) Father abused and/or neglected\r\n  Children pursuant to section 63-7-20 of the South Carolina Code (2008); (2) Father\r\n  used excessive corporal punishment on C.D.; and (3) DSS made reasonable efforts\r\n  to prevent or eliminate the need for removal.Â  Accordingly, the family court\r\n  order is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS, KONDUROS,\r\n  JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Because Father's conduct did not meet the third\r\n  guideline of section 63-7-20(4), we need not address the remaining guidelines.Â  See S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Father and Mother, 294 S.C. 518,\r\n  521, 366 S.E.2d 40, 42&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1988) (holding this court does not need\r\n  to address a parent's argument as to each of the guidelines when the conduct clearly\r\n  does not meet at least one of them).\r\n[2] Father also argues the family court erred in refusing\r\n  to admonish DSS; however, based on the facts of this case, we decline to\r\n  address this issue.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-179","title":"State v.

Anderson, III, Administrative Law\r\nCourt Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2010-UP-182\r\n  Heard October 7, 2009 â€“ Filed March 1,\r\n2010\r\nWithdrawn, Substituted and Refiled June\r\n28, 2010\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Carlisle Roberts, Jr., of Columbia; Davis Arjuna\r\n          Whitfield-Cargile, of Charleston; Elizabeth Applegate Dieck and Evander\r\n          Whitehead, both of North Charleston, for Appellant.\r\n        Christopher Holmes, of Mount Pleasant, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â This\r\n  appeal concerns an administrative enforcement order issued by South Carolina\r\n  Department of Health and Environmental Control (the Department) against Philip Przyborowski\r\n  requiring the removal of a previously approved private dock on the ground that it\r\n  exceeded the maximum allowable dimensions under the applicable regulation.Â  In\r\n  the appealed order, the ALC determined that given the absence of any\r\n  enforcement action against a similarly situated dock owner, the Department's\r\n  institution of an enforcement action against Przyborowski &quot;reflect[ed]\r\n  arbitrary and purposeful discrimination in the administration of the law.&quot;Â \r\n  The Department appeals. \r\nWe\r\n  affirm the following issues raised by the Department pursuant to Rule 220(b),\r\n  SCACR, and the following authorities:Â  (1) as to the timeliness of\r\n  Przyborowski's request for review:Â  Rule 6(e), SCRCP (allowing five additional\r\n  days to any prescribed period after service for a party to respond if service\r\n  was by mail); Rule 3(C), SCALCR (providing a similar extension to that in Rule\r\n  6(e), SCRCP), and (2) as to issues relating to the ALC's finding that the\r\n  Department's enforcement action against Przyborowski was arbitrary: Â S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(B) (Supp. 2009) (&quot;The court may not substitute its\r\n  judgment for the judgment of the administrative law judge as to the weight of\r\n  the evidence on questions of fact.&quot;); Neal v. Brown, 383 S.C. 619, 623,\r\n  682 S.E.2d 268, 269 (2009) (&quot;In permitting cases, the ALC serves as the\r\n  finder of fact.&quot;).Â  Pursuant to section 1-23-610(B)(e) and (f), however,\r\n  we modify the appealed order to uphold the dismissal of the enforcement action\r\n  based on the ALC's finding that the enforcement action was arbitrary, rather\r\n  than on the finding that the action amounted to a violation of Przyborowski's\r\n  equal protection rights.\r\nBased on our decision to affirm the appealed order, we decline to\r\n  address Przyborowski's argument that the ALC erred in holding it could not\r\n  invoke equitable estoppel as a defense to the Department's enforcement action.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown,\r\n    Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (stating\r\n      an appellate court need not address remaining issues when a decision on a prior\r\n      issue is dispositive); Whiteside v.

As to\r\n  whether the circuit court erred in failing to include damages for lost earnings\r\n  or permanent injury in the amount of its additur or in failing to grant a new\r\n  trial absolute:Â  In re Michael H., 360 S.C. 540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729,\r\n  732 (2004) (&quot;An issue may not be raised for the first time on appeal.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General\r\n  Salley W. Elliott, and Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr.,\r\n  all of Columbia; and Solicitor Douglas A. Barfield, Jr., of Lancaster, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Michael\r\n  A. Blair appeals his convictions for failure to stop for a blue light and\r\n  trafficking in crack cocaine, arguing the trial court erred in refusing to\r\n  charge the jury on the affirmative defense of entrapment.Â  We reverse and remand for a new trial\r\n  based on the trial court's refusal to charge entrapment. \r\nThis\r\n  case is substantially similar to State v. Brown,\r\n  362 S.C. 258, 265, 607 S.E.2d 93, 96-97 (Ct. App. 2004) (reversing and\r\n  remanding for a new trial when there was evidence to support an entrapment\r\n  charge yet the trial court refused to instruct the jury on the defense of\r\n  entrapment).Â  Specifically, the defendant\r\n  in Brown was entitled to an entrapment charge because there was\r\n  sufficient evidence of inducement and lack of predisposition.Â  Id. at\r\n  264, 607 S.E.2d at 96. \r\nLike\r\n  the defendant in Brown, Blair delayed approximately two hours in\r\n  arriving at the agreed-upon location.Â  In the interim, Tina Peay, the\r\n  confidential informant, called Blair to find out what was taking him so long.Â  The\r\n  sheriff's office was not aware of Blair prior to Peay's phone call to a man\r\n  named &quot;Tony.&quot;Â  In the tape recorded conversation with Peay, Blair stated,\r\n  &quot;I ain't got nothing on me, so y'all might have to come back up here to\r\n  see the dude.&quot;Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on these facts, Blair produced more than a scintilla of evidence of his lack of\r\n  predisposition.Â  See Brown, 362 S.C. at 263, 607 S.E.2d\r\n  at 95. Once established, the burden shifted to the prosecution to prove\r\n  predisposition beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Id.Â  The trial court agreed\r\n  with the solicitor's assessment that there &quot;may have been some\r\n  predisposition&quot; on Blair's part and declined to charge entrapment on that\r\n  basis.Â  However, the prosecution did not\r\n  meet its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Specifically, there was\r\n  not undisputed evidence of predisposition leading to only one reasonable\r\n  conclusion.Â  See State\r\n    v. Johnson, 295 S.C. 215,\r\n  217, 367 S.E.2d 700, 701 (1988) (&quot;The issue of whether or not the defense\r\n  of entrapment has been established is ordinarily a question of fact for a jury\r\n  unless there is undisputed evidence and only one reasonable conclusion can be\r\n  reached.&quot;).Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  Blair suffered two-fold prejudice in this case: (1) entrapment was Blair's only\r\n  defense, and (2) the solicitor made comments regarding the absence of an\r\n  entrapment charge during closing arguments.Â  Accordingly, this matter is\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.[1] Â Â \r\nHUFF, THOMAS, and\r\n  KONDUROS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-195","title":"State v.

Fraley, Jr., Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No.Â  2010-UP-196\r\n  Heard September 1, 2009 â€“ Filed March 8,\r\n2010\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Jan Warner, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Kermit King, Mary Katherine Sherman, Rebecca West, and Tina\r\n          Cundari, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this appeal of a divorce decree,Â  Stella Black\r\n  (Wife) alleges error in the family court's decisions regarding findings of\r\n  fact, alimony, transmutation, valuation of assets, attorney's fees, marital\r\n  fault, life insurance, and the disqualification of Harold Whitney Black's\r\n  (Husband's) attorney.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were married\r\n  on January 6, 1994.Â  Each had been married before, and neither had children\r\n  from their respective prior marriages, nor were any children born of this\r\n  marriage.Â  \r\nIn 1972, Husband incorporated\r\n  Whit-Ash Furnishings, Inc., a retail business selling furniture and home\r\n  accessories in which he is a 51% shareholder.Â  Husband also owns 49% of The\r\n  Burton Agency, LLP, which owns real estate, some of which is rented to Whit-Ash.Â  \r\nWife alleges that between the\r\n  fall of 1991 and the parties' marriage in 1994, she performed a number of\r\n  services that purportedly resulted in economic benefits to Husband and his\r\n  interests in Whit-Ash and Burton.Â  After their marriage, Wife maintains she\r\n  initiated jewelry and gift sales at Whit-Ash, handled television and other\r\n  advertising, engaged in community activities, and did buying for the business.Â \r\n  Husband contends Wife did not have a position in the business, performed no\r\n  day-to-day responsibilities, went to the store only sporadically, and when\r\n  occasionally travelling with other Whit-Ash employees to jewelry markets, would\r\n  buy items for herself instead of the store.Â  \r\nIn 2003, Wife embarked on a\r\n  career in the music business.Â  According to Wife, Husband funded her efforts,\r\n  deducted the losses on the parties' personal income tax returns, and had\r\n  attorney Rebecca West, who had been his and Whit-Ash's personal attorney,\r\n  assist with her endeavors.Â  In addition, with Husband's consent, other Whit-Ash\r\n  employees assisted Wife with computer work, travel arrangements, and other\r\n  tasks associated with her pursuit of a music career.\r\nIn 2001, discord in the\r\n  marriage began to escalate and Husband temporarily left the marital residence.Â \r\n  Upon his return, Wife allegedly became more verbally abusive toward him and in\r\n  October 2005, the parties had a physical altercation, after which Husband left\r\n  the marital residence permanently.Â  \r\nOn January 17, 2006, Wife\r\n  commenced this action, seeking separate maintenance and support, including\r\n  security for support, equitable division, a finding that certain assets Husband\r\n  acquired before the marriage had been transmuted or that Wife was entitled to a\r\n  special equity in them, and attorney's fees and costs.Â  Husband denied Wife's\r\n  allegations and counterclaimed for a divorce on the ground of adultery and a\r\n  bar to Wife receiving alimony.Â  \r\nThe family court issued a\r\n  temporary order on May 30, 2006, (1) finding Husband had not established a\r\n  prima facie case of adultery; (2) awarding Wife temporary alimony of $9,000 per\r\n  month and exclusive possession of the marital home; and (3) ordering Husband to\r\n  maintain health coverage for Wife, pay the mortgage, taxes, and insurance on\r\n  the marital home, and advance $30,000 as Wife's suit money and temporary\r\n  attorney's fees.Â  \r\nDuring the pendency of this\r\n  action, Wife sought unsuccessfully to disqualify attorney Rebecca West from\r\n  appearing on Husband's behalf on the ground that West had previously\r\n  represented her when she attempted to establish herself in the music business.Â Â  \r\nIn the final decree, filed\r\n  March 4, 2008, the family court granted Wife a divorce on the ground of a\r\n  one-year's continuous separation, finding neither party was entitled to a\r\n  divorce based on fault grounds.Â  In addition, the family court awarded Wife\r\n  permanent alimony of $5,500 per month and required Husband to secure this award\r\n  with $1.5 million dollars in life insurance.Â  Furthermore, the family court\r\n  declined to find that Husband's interests in both Whit-Ash and Burton had been\r\n  transmuted into marital property or that Wife was entitled to a special equity\r\n  in either asset.Â  Wife received the marital residence subject to the mortgage\r\n  on the property and was directed to pay Husband $41,000 at the rate of $1,000\r\n  per month from her alimony.Â  Wife also received an additional $45,000 in\r\n  attorney's fees and costs.Â  \r\nBoth parties filed post-trial\r\n  motions.Â  In response to the motions, the court amended its order to reflect\r\n  Wife's correct date of birth.Â  The court also reduced the amount of life\r\n  insurance Husband was to carry to secure his alimony obligation from $1.5\r\n  million to $750,000.Â  On March 31, 2008, Wife filed a notice of appeal.[1]\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;A divorce action is a\r\n  matter in equity heard by the family court judge; on appeal, the court's scope\r\n  of review extends to the finding of facts based on its own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence.&quot; Thomson v. Thomson, 377 S.C. 613,\r\n  619,Â  661 S.E.2d 130, 133 (Ct. App. 2008) (citing McLaughlin v. McLaughlin,\r\n  283 S.C. 404, 405-06, 323 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1984)).Â  &quot;However, our broad\r\n  scope of review does not require us to disregard the findings of the family\r\n  court or to ignore the fact that the trial judge saw and heard the witnesses\r\n  and was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign\r\n  comparative weight to their testimony.&quot;Â  Id. (citing Tinsley v.\r\n    Tinsley, 326 S.C. 374, 380, 483 S.E.2d 198, 201 (Ct. App. 1997)).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1. Wife\r\n  argues the family court's finding of facts are in error because the court\r\n  failed to give due consideration to Husband's alleged marital fault and lack of\r\n  credibility.Â  We disagree.\r\nCiting McCrosson v. Tanenbaum, 375 S.C. 225,\r\n  652 S.E.2d 73 (Ct. App. 2007), Wife argues the family court improperly ignored\r\n  or discounted evidence that Husband, with the assistance of others in the case\r\n  wove a &quot;web of deceit&quot; and &quot;engaged in a campaign of egregious\r\n  concealment, complication, and out and out lying in an effort to attempt to\r\n  obtain a financial advantage in this case.&quot;Â  &quot;However, our broad\r\n  scope of review does not require us to disregard the findings of the family\r\n  court or to ignore the fact that the trial judge saw and heard the witnesses\r\n  and was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign\r\n  comparative weight to their testimony.&quot;Â  Thomson, 377 S.C. at 619,\r\n  661 S.E.2d at 133.Â  We believe the supreme court's express discrediting of this\r\n  court's statement in McCrosson about a reviewing court's advantage in an\r\n  emotionally charged trial is in itself sufficient reason to defer to the family\r\n  court; however, we also agree with Husband that any misconduct on his part\r\n  during the litigation pales in comparison with that in McCrosson.Â  See McCrosson v. Tanenbaum, 383 S.C. 150, 151, 679 S.E.2d 172, 172 (2009)\r\n  (explaining the court of appeals' decision &quot;improperly implie[d] that the\r\n  family court was 'distracted by an emotionally charged trial' &quot;).Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find no error on the part of the family court.\r\n2. Wife\r\n  argues the family court erred in awarding Wife permanent alimony of only $5,500\r\n  per month.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;An award of alimony\r\n  rests within the sound discretion of family court and will not be disturbed\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  Craig v. Craig, 365 S.C. 285, 292,\r\n  617 S.E.2d 359, 362 (2005).Â  &quot;Generally, alimony should place the\r\n  supported spouse, as nearly as practical, in the same position as enjoyed\r\n  during the marriage.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nThe legislature has set forth\r\n  twelve factors for a family court to consider in determining an alimony award.Â \r\n  These factors include duration of the marriage, the physical and emotional\r\n  health of the parties, the parties' education, their work experience and\r\n  earning potentials, the standard of living established during the marriage,\r\n  current and reasonably anticipated expenses, marital and nonmarital properties\r\n  of the parties, and marital misconduct or fault.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C)\r\n  (Supp. 2009).Â  \r\nAs the family court properly\r\n  addressed the statutory alimony factors, we defer to the discretion of the\r\n  family court and find no error with the alimony award.Â  \r\n3. Wife\r\n  argues the family court erred in declining to find Husband's interests in\r\n  Whit-Ash and Burton were transmuted into marital property or, in the\r\n  alternative, that she was entitled to special equity interests in these\r\n  assets.Â  We disagree.\r\nMarital property is defined as &quot;all real and\r\n  personal property which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage\r\n  and which is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital\r\n  litigation.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-630 (Supp. 2009).Â  Excluded from\r\n  marital property is &quot;property acquired by either party before the\r\n  marriage.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Non-marital property can be considered to have\r\n  transmuted into marital property &quot; '(1) if it becomes so commingled with\r\n  marital property as to be untraceable; (2) if it is titled jointly; or (3) if\r\n  it is utilized by the parties in support of the marriage or in some other\r\n  manner so as to evidence an intent by the parties to make it marital\r\n  property.&quot;Â  Thomson, 377 S.C. at 620, 661 S.E.2d at 133 (quoting Johnson\r\n    v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 295, 372 S.E.2d 107, 110 (Ct. App. 1998).Â \r\n  &quot;The burden is on the spouse claiming transmutation to produce objective\r\n  evidence that the parties considered the property to be marital during the\r\n  marriage.&quot;Â  Pirri v. Pirri, 369 S.C. 258, 270, 631 S.E.2d 279, 286\r\n  (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Evidence of transmutation may include placing the property in\r\n  joint names, transferring the property to the other spouse as a gift, using\r\n  theÂ  property exclusively for marital purposes, commingling the property with\r\n  marital property, using marital funds to build equity in the property, or\r\n  exchanging the property for marital property.Â  Johnson, 296 S.C. at 295,\r\n  372 S.E.2d at 110-11.Â  Mere use of the income from a spouse's separate property\r\n  in support of the marriage does not transmute the property into a marital\r\n  asset.Â  Pirri, 369 S.C. at 270, 631 S.E.2d at 286.\r\nUpon review of the record we find the evidence\r\n  supports the family court's ruling that the non-marital property did not\r\n  transmute.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the ruling of the family court.\r\n4. Wife\r\n  argues the family court erred in its valuation of Husband's interests in\r\n  Whit-Ash and Burton.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA family court may accept\r\n  the valuation of one party over another, and the courtâ€™s valuation of marital\r\n  property will be affirmed if it is within the range of evidence presented.â€Â  Pirri,\r\n  at 264, 631 S.E.2d at 283.Â  We find the family court's valuation to be within\r\n  the range of evidence presented.Â  \r\nMoreover, we are inclined to\r\n  agree with Husband that, inasmuch as Wife has not argued that the family\r\n  court's allegedly erroneous valuations of the businesses led to other errors,\r\n  this issue is of no consequence.Â  See Miles v. Miles, 303 S.C.\r\n  33, 36, 397 S.E.2d 790, 792 (Ct. App. 1990) (recognizing an overriding rule\r\n  that &quot;whatever doesn't make a difference, doesn't matter&quot;).\r\n5. Wife\r\n  argues she should have received a larger award of attorney's fees and costs.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe family court may award\r\n  reasonable attorney's fees and costs based on &quot;the financial resources and\r\n  marital fault of both parties.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(H) (Supp.\r\n  2009).Â  \r\nAttorney's fees awards are\r\n  within the family court's discretion.Â  Upchurch v. Upchurch, 367 S.C.\r\n  16, 28, 624 S.E.2d 643, 648 (2008).Â  &quot;In determining the reasonable amount\r\n  of attorneys fees to award, the court should consider the nature, extent, and\r\n  difficulty of the services rendered, the time necessarily devoted to the case,\r\n  counsel's professional standing, the contingency of compensation, the\r\n  beneficial results obtained, and customary fees for similar services.&quot;Â  Roberson\r\n    v. Roberson, 359 S.C. 384, 392, 597 S.E.2d 840, 844 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Here\r\n  we find the family court's award of attorney's fees to be within its\r\n  discretion.Â  \r\n6. Wife\r\n  argues she is entitled to a divorce based on the ground of desertion.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nA spouse seeking a divorce on\r\n  the ground of desertion must show &quot;(1) cessation from cohabitation for . .\r\n  . one year; (2) intent on the part of the absenting party not to resume it; (3)\r\n  absence of the opposing party's consent; and (4) absence of justification.&quot;\r\n  Â Fort v. Fort, 270 S.C. 255, 259, 241 S.E.2d 891, 893 (1978).Â \r\n  &quot;Where the departing spouse has just cause for leaving, her doing so does\r\n  not constitute desertion.&quot;Â  Smith v. Smith, 260 S.C. 65, 67, 194\r\n  S.E.2d 199 (1973). \r\nWe find the facts support the\r\n  family court's refusal to award a divorce on the grounds of desertion.Â  \r\n7. Wife\r\n  argues the family court erred in reducing the amount of life insurance that\r\n  Husband was to maintain to secure his alimony obligation.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder section 20-3-130(D) of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008), the family court &quot;may make provision\r\n  for security for the payment&quot; of spousal support, and, in conjunction with\r\n  this provision, may direct a supporting spouse &quot;to carry and maintain life\r\n  insurance so as to assure support of a spouse beyond the death of the payor\r\n  spouse.&quot;Â  In this regard, there must be some evidentiary basis to support\r\n  the amount of coverage ordered; however, this may be in response to an appeal\r\n  by the payor spouse.Â  See, e.g., Zangari v. Cunningham, 839 So.\r\n  2d 918, 919 (Fla. Ct. App. 2003) (citing cases referencing a requirement that\r\n  the amount of life insurance coverage required bear some correlation to the\r\n  projected alimony amounts).Â  Other recent out-of-state authority holds the\r\n  amount of life insurance ordered to secure an alimony obligation is\r\n  discretionary with the court.Â  See e.g., Braun v. Braun, 907\r\n  N.E.2d 681 (Mass. App. Ct. 2009) (wherein after noting an order requiring the\r\n  payor spouse to maintain life insurance was discretionary, the court further\r\n  held:Â  &quot;It follows that the amount of such insurance also rests in the\r\n  discretion of the judge.&quot;)\r\nHere, we find the family\r\n  court was within its discretion to reduce the amount of life insurance Husband\r\n  was required to maintain.Â  \r\n8. Wife\r\n  argues the family court should have granted her motion to disqualify attorney\r\n  Rebecca West from representing Husband in this matter.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe comments to the South\r\n  Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct provide: &quot;After termination of a\r\n  client-lawyer relationship, a lawyer has certain continuing duties with respect\r\n  to confidentiality . . . and thus may not represent another client except in\r\n  conformity with [the Rules.]&quot;Â  Rule 407, SCACR, Rule 1.9 n. 1 (2009). \r\nIn this case, the family\r\n  court determined West obtained no confidential information through her\r\n  representation of Wife, and because Wife communicated no &quot;substantial\r\n  information&quot; and because such information was communicated through third\r\n  parties or involved interactions between Wife and third parties, such\r\n  information was not entitled to attorney-client privilege.[2]Â \r\n  Notwithstanding that Wife fails to substantiate what legal remedy, if any, is\r\n  afforded her by the Rules of Professional Conduct on appeal; we find the record\r\n  supports the family court's finding that West gained no confidential or\r\n  &quot;substantial information&quot; during the course of her limited\r\n  representation of Wife.Â  Furthermore, we find it compelling to note, as did the\r\n  family court, that the information creating the alleged conflict could have\r\n  been obtained from other sources, such as the Wife's affidavit and the\r\n  Temporary Order, all of which were filed before West was a named counsel for\r\n  Husband.Â  For these reasons Wife has failed to demonstrate any prejudice, and\r\n  we therefore affirm the ruling of the family court.Â  See Davis v.\r\n    Davis, 372 S.C. 64, 86, 641 S.E.2d 446, 458 (Ct. App. 2006) (stating that\r\n  this court will not reverse the family court unless the error is material and\r\n  prejudicial to the substantial rights of the appellant).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the aforementioned reasons, the ruling of the\r\n  trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHUFF, THOMAS, and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Wife also filed an unsuccessful petition for a writ\r\n  of supersedeas with this Court to reinstate the temporary alimony award.Â  \r\n[2]Â Â  We recognize that the family court also found that\r\n  even had the attorney-client privilege arisen, Wife implicitly waived any\r\n  objection of West's representation of Husband.Â  While we need not decide\r\n  whether Wife's affirmative act of placing her earning potential in question,\r\n  for the purposes of alimony calculation, constitutes a waiver of privilege, we\r\n  do find that without West possessing any confidential information, the record\r\n  in this matter and the jurisprudence of this state support the family court's\r\n  indication that Wife's delay of over one year from the time West became\r\n  Husband's counsel, over ten months from the date of the deposition in which\r\n  Wife protested West's presence, and over nine months after Wife's attorney\r\n  served West with the Notice of Appearance, waived any objection to West's\r\n  representation of Husband.Â  SeeÂ Â  Bakala v.

Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570(8) (2008) (allowing the family\r\n  court to terminate parental rights when TPR is in the child's best interests\r\n  and &quot;[t]he child has been in foster care under the responsibility of the\r\n  State for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months&quot;).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n2.&nbsp; As to\r\n  whether family court erred in finding Mother failed to remedy the conditions\r\n  leading to Children's removal: S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570(2) (2008) (stating\r\n  the family court may terminate parental rights when TPR is in the child's best\r\n  interests and the child has been removed from the parent and has been out of\r\n  the home for a period of six months following the adoption of a placement plan\r\n  by court order or by agreement between the department and the parent, and the\r\n  parent has not remedied the conditions that caused the removal); Dep't of\r\n    Soc. Servs. v. Pritchett, 296 S.C. 517, 520, 374 S.E.2d 500, 501 (Ct. App.\r\n  1988) (&quot;[A]n attempt to remedy alone is inadequate to preserve\r\n  parental rights. Â Otherwise, the statute would be couched in such terms. Â The\r\n  attempt must have, in fact, remedied the conditions.&quot;).&nbsp; \r\n3.&nbsp; As to\r\n  whether the family court erred in finding Mother failed to materially and\r\n  financially support Children: Stinecipher v. Ballington, 366 S.C. 92,\r\n  100 n.6, 620 S.E.2d 93, 98&nbsp;n.6 (Ct.

Guest, Jr., of Murrells Inlet, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  In this domestic action, William C. Gaither, III (Husband) appeals the family\r\n  court's amended order awarding Cathryn G. Gaither (Wife) eight thousand dollars\r\n  in attorney's fees and ordering Husband to convey certain real property and to\r\n  make final equitable distribution payment to Wife within thirty days of the\r\n  order.Â  Husband argues (1) the family court was without jurisdiction to require\r\n  Husband to make payment or convey property to Wife and (2) the family court\r\n  improperly applied the Glasscock factors in awarding attorney's fees to\r\n  Wife.Â  See Glasscock v.\r\n    Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403 S.E.2d\r\n  313 (1991).Â  We affirm in\r\n  part but reverse the award of attorney's fees. \r\n1.Â  As\r\n  to the Husband's first argument that the family court lacked jurisdiction, we\r\n  affirm.Â  It was appropriate for the family court to modify the original order\r\n  because this court made a substantive change to the value of the marital estate\r\n  and remanded for the family court to reapportion the property. Â See Gaither v. Gaither, Op. No. 2006-UP-422 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Dec.\r\n  19, 2006). Â Pursuant to our order of remand, the family court had\r\n  jurisdiction to order Husband to convey the property and make final payment\r\n  within thirty days of its amended order.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-3-620(C) (Supp. 2009) (&quot;The [family] court's order as it affects\r\n  distribution of marital property shall be a final order not subject to\r\n  modification except by appeal or remand following proper appeal.&quot;).\r\n2.Â  As to the Husband's second argument that the\r\n  family court improperly applied the Glasscock factors for awarding\r\n  attorney's fees, we reverse.Â  This court previously reversed and remanded for\r\n  the family court to reconsider Wife's entitlement to attorney's fees.Â  Gaither\r\n    v. Gaither, Op. No. 2006-UP-422 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Dec. 19, 2006).Â  The\r\n  resulting family court order failed to make specific factual findings on each\r\n  of the six factors under Glasscock, instead focusing on Wife's inability\r\n  to pay her fees.Â  See Glasscock, 304 S.C. at 161, 403 S.E.2d at\r\n  315; see also Griffith v. Griffith,&nbsp;332 S.C. 630, 646, 506\r\n  S.E.2d 526, 534-35 (Ct. App. 1998) (noting the family court order awarding\r\n  attorney's fees must set forth specific findings of fact for each of the\r\n  required factors).Â  Inability to pay is one of four factors in determining whether to award attorney's fees.Â  See E.D.M. v. T.A.M, 307 S.C. 471,\r\n  476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  \r\nWife's\r\n  affidavit in support of attorney's fees was not included in the record on appeal.Â \r\n  We consider the record only as it was presented to us.Â  See Rule 210(c),\r\n  SCACR (&quot;The Record on Appeal shall include all matter designated to be\r\n  included by any party . . . &quot;).Â  In addition, Wife did not file a\r\n  respondent's brief in the current appeal.Â  Rule 208(a)(4), SCACR,\r\n  provides in part: &quot;Upon the failure of the respondent to timely file a\r\n  brief, the appellate court may take such action as it deems proper.&quot; Â This\r\n  action includes reversing the judgment below. Â See Wierszewski v.\r\n    Tokarick, 308 S.C. 441, 444 n.2, 418 S.E.2d 557, 559 n.2 (Ct. App. 1992)\r\n  (holding that when the respondent failed to file a brief, the appellate court\r\n  deemed it proper &quot;to reverse on the points presented rather than to search\r\n  the record for reasons to affirm&quot;).Â  Accordingly, we reverse the family\r\n  court's award of attorney's fees.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.[1] Â Â \r\nHUFF, THOMAS,\r\n  and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-215","title":"Gallman v.

Jones challenges the circuit\r\n  court's dismissal of its appeal from a probate court order for failure to serve\r\n  the notice of intention to appeal on all parties. Â On appeal, the Estate argues\r\n  the circuit court erred in relying on section 62-1-308 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code as the exclusive rule governing the procedural requirements for appeals\r\n  from probate court and argues application of Rule 5(a) of the South Carolina\r\n  Rules of Civil Procedure to probate court appeals would relieve Appellant of\r\n  its requirement to serve a notice of intent to appeal on parties in default.[1]Â  \r\nWe\r\n  affirm[2] the order of the circuit court pursuant to Rule 220(b)(2), SCACR, and the\r\n  following authorities:Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-308(a) (2009) (requiring notice\r\n  of intent to appeal be served on &quot;all parties&quot; within ten days after\r\n  receipt of written notice of the appealed from order of the probate court); Rule 74, SCRCP\r\n  (stating &quot;the procedure on appeal to the circuit court from the judgment\r\n  of an inferior court . . . shall be in accordance with the statutes providing\r\n  such appeals.&quot;); Skinner v.

Shane Massey, of Aiken, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tDennis M. Gmerek, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\tPatrick A. McWilliams, of Aiken, for Guardian ad Litem.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Lisa H. (Mother) appeals the family court's decision\r\n  to terminate her parental rights to her minor child, N.R. (Child). Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570 (2008).Â  Mother argues the family court erred\r\n  in considering six unfounded reports of child abuse and neglect and in\r\n  considering Mother's arrest history when it made the decision to terminate\r\n  Mother's rights.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nChild entered\r\n  foster care for the first time in September of 2004, after Mother admitted in a\r\n  police report she used illicit drugs and left Child unattended.Â  Mother\r\n  eventually complied with her court ordered treatment plan, and Child was\r\n  returned to her custody in November of 2005.Â  Child entered foster care for the\r\n  second time after Mother was arrested for burglary and no one was available to\r\n  care for Child.Â  Mother again complied with her treatment plan, and Child was\r\n  returned to her custody in July of 2008.Â  Child entered foster care for the\r\n  third time in August of 2008, due to Mother's arrest on driving under the\r\n  influence (DUI) charges.Â  No adult was available to take care of Child.Â  The\r\n  family court approved the South Carolina Department of Social Services' (the\r\n  Department) recommendation for termination of parental rights (TPR) and\r\n  adoption after Child entered foster care for the third time.Â  \r\nDuring\r\n  the TPR hearing, a case worker for the Department testified regarding six\r\n  unfounded reports of abuse or neglect regarding Mother and Child.Â  The\r\n  unfounded reports at issue in this case included: three reports stating Mother\r\n  was using illegal drugs around Child; one report stating Mother left Child\r\n  alone in a car; one report stating Child was being physically abused; and one\r\n  report stating Mother left Child in the care of a man being treated for\r\n  depression and alcohol addiction.Â  Mother objected, arguing the admission of\r\n  these unfounded reports was more prejudicial than probative, and moreover, the\r\n  reports were irrelevant.Â  The family court overruled Mother's objection and\r\n  allowed the Department's case worker to testify regarding all six unfounded\r\n  reports of abuse or neglect.Â  \r\nMother\r\n  testified during the TPR hearing and admitted she had been arrested four or\r\n  five times since Child's birth. Â The Department asked Mother about two\r\n  1985 convictions, one for DUI and the other for a property crime. Â Mother\r\n  immediately objected, arguing these crimes were inadmissible because they were\r\n  both over ten years old and did not carry a term over one year's imprisonment.Â \r\n  The family court first sustained Mother's objection, but later changed its\r\n  stance and overruled the objection. Â The family court also allowed the\r\n  Department to ask Mother about a 1995 arrest for an open container in her car.Â  Mother explained her 2008 DUI arrest charge was reduced to reckless\r\n  driving.Â  The Department entered a copy of Mother's arrest history into\r\n  evidence over Mother's objection.Â  The arrest history included a 2007 arrest\r\n  for first-degree burglary, two separate 2005 arrests for disorderly conduct,\r\n  and a 2002 arrest for providing false information to a police officer.Â  \r\nThe guardian\r\n  ad litem's (GAL) report noted Child told troubling stories about living with\r\n  Mother, including the following:\r\n\r\n\tChild\r\n  tells stories of things that happened when he lived with mom, e.g., mom\r\n  attacked the pool with a knife, mom sleeps with him without her shirt on, a man\r\n  sleeps with him and had a heart attack, cats scratching him, dogs biting him,\r\n  somebody shooting out of the back window of mom's car, dad chasing mom down the\r\n  street and beating her up, being held underwater in the bathtub so he couldn't\r\n  breathe.\r\n\r\nThe GAL also noted Child was\r\n  overly affectionate with women, used profanity and profane gestures, and had\r\n  recurring nightmares when he entered foster care for the second time in July of\r\n  2007.Â  Finally, the GAL report stated Child is &quot;much better adjusted since\r\n  entering foster care.Â  He plays well with other children and enjoys his current\r\n  home.Â  He listens to and obeys authoritative figures.Â  He has even gone off his\r\n  medication at the request of his doctor.&quot;Â  The GAL recommended\r\n  termination of Mother's parental rights because of her instability and\r\n  inability to care for Child. \r\nThe\r\n  family court's final TPR order found Mother's rights should be terminated on\r\n  the following statutory grounds: (1) physical neglect or substantial risk of\r\n  physical neglect and because of the severity or repetition of the abuse or\r\n  neglect, it was not reasonably likely that the home could be made safe within\r\n  twelve months and (2) Child\r\n  was in foster care under the responsibility of the state for fifteen of the\r\n  most recent twenty-two months.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570(1), (8) (2008).Â  The\r\n  family court noted the Department received nine reports involving Child and\r\n  Mother, and while six of the reports were unfounded, at least three were\r\n  indicated and resulted in Child being placed in foster care.Â  The family\r\n  court described the conduct that resulted in Child entering foster care,\r\n  including Mother's use of illegal drugs, Mother's criminal activity, and\r\n  Mother's misuse of alcohol.Â  The order did not explicitly mention any of\r\n  Mother's remote convictions or arrests.Â  The family court also found TPR was in\r\n  Child's best interest.Â  Finally, the order noted adoption\r\n  services accepted Child for placement, and the Department identified a number\r\n  of potential resources for Child.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAfter reviewing the record on appeal, and we find the\r\n  statutory grounds for TPR were supported by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Charleston\r\n    County Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Jackson, 368 S.C. 87, 95, 627 S.E.2d 765,\r\n  770&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006) (noting in an appeal from a TPR, an appellate court\r\n  may review the record and make its own determination of whether the grounds for\r\n  termination are supported by clear and convincing evidence).Â  Specifically,\r\n  Child was in foster care under the responsibility of the state for fifteen of\r\n  the most recent twenty-two months.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570(8) (2008).Â  In\r\n  addition, the Department entered three indicated reports of abuse and neglect,\r\n  which resulted in Child entering foster care on three separate occasions.Â  We\r\n  believe this evidence was sufficient to demonstrate a repetitive history of\r\n  abuse and neglect such that it was not reasonably likely the home could be made\r\n  safe within twelve months.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570(1) (2008).Â  Finally, the\r\n  GAL's report recommended termination would be in Child's best interest due to\r\n  Mother's instability and inability to care for Child. Â Â§ 63-7-2570; S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Smith, 343 S.C. 129, 133, 538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2000) (&quot;In a [TPR] case, the best interests of the child are the\r\n  paramount consideration.&quot;).\r\nMother\r\n  argues the family court erred in admitting six unfounded reports of abuse and\r\n  neglect and in considering Mother's arrest history. Â However, we do not believe\r\n  Mother can demonstrate any prejudice from the admission of this arguably\r\n  irrelevant evidence.Â  See Brown v. Allstate Ins. Co., 344 S.C.\r\n  21, 27, 542 S.E.2d 723, 726 (2001) (&quot;A trial judge's role in a bench trial\r\n  is to admit all evidence and then evaluate it in a non-jury setting.&quot;); Green\r\n    v.

Landrum (Landrum)\r\n  appeals his conviction for assault upon a state or local correctional employee\r\n  pursuant to section 16-3-630 of the South Carolina Code (2003).Â  On appeal,\r\n  Landrum argues the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury on\r\n  self-defense and simple assault.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nAt trial, Corrections\r\n  Officer Gerry L. Scott (Scott) testified that he conducted an inmate count at\r\n  the Lexington County Detention Center (Detention Center) on April 29, 2006.Â  In\r\n  conducting his count, Scott testified that he entered and completed a brief\r\n  inspection of Landrum's cell and that Landrum requested a gray bin.[2]Â \r\n  Scott informed Landrum that a gray bin would be provided if one was available. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLater in the day, Landrum\r\n  requested a care package, which included a toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant,\r\n  and a comb.Â  Landrum was subsequently informed that a care package was\r\n  unavailable.Â  At this point, Landrum's tone became more forceful and aggressive.Â \r\n  Scott stated Landrum then crossed the yellow line[3] and demanded a care package.Â  As a result of Landrum's behavior, Scott\r\n  repeatedly instructed Landrum to cross back over the yellow line.Â  Landrum\r\n  initially refused to comply with Scott's instruction and said, &quot;Fuck\r\n  you.&quot;Â  \r\nAfter this incident, Scott instructed Landrum to\r\n  return to his cell.Â  Landrum requested to see a supervisor, but his request was\r\n  denied. In response, Landrum refused to return to his cell, despite Scott repeatedly\r\n  ordering Landrum to report to his cell.Â  \r\nWhen Scott and\r\n  Landrum reached the top of the stairs, Scott testified Landrum refused to go\r\n  any further, and Landrum renewed his request to see a supervisor.Â  Again, Scott\r\n  ordered Landrum to return to his cell.Â  At that point, Scott testified that\r\n  Landrum approached him in a &quot;very quick manner, aggressive style&quot; and\r\n  that Landrum glared at him with a locked fist and straight arms and came within\r\n  eight inches of Scott.Â  Based on these &quot;attack cues,&quot; Scott performed\r\n  an open palm heel strike[4] to Landrum's chest and attempted to place Landrum in a straight arm bar\r\n  takedown.Â  According to Scott, a physical altercation ensued.Â  Landrum struck Scott\r\n  on the side of the head and Scott suffered a laceration when his head hit the\r\n  wall.Â  \r\nThe State called\r\n  Dr. Carl McCord (Dr. McCord), a physician at Lexington Medical Center Urgent\r\n  Care, to testify regarding the extent of Scott's injuries.Â  Dr. McCord stated\r\n  Scott had &quot;a lot of blood on his face&quot; and an &quot;obvious injury on\r\n  his right forehead and his eyebrow&quot; that required eighteen sutures.Â  \r\nThe State also\r\n  called Don Wieder (Wieder), a law enforcement training sergeant with the\r\n  Lexington County Sheriff's Office.Â  Wieder testified that he teaches defensive\r\n  techniques at the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy.Â  After the State set\r\n  forth Wieder's qualifications, the trial court subsequently qualified Wieder as\r\n  an expert in the use of force.Â  Wieder testified an officer is trained to\r\n  create distance when an inmate approaches in an aggressive manner by\r\n  implementing certain techniques such as stepping back or using a defensive\r\n  counterstrike.Â  Based on Scott's testimony, Wieder concluded Scott's palm heel\r\n  defensive counterstrike and straight arm bar takedown were appropriate\r\n  responses to Landrum's aggressiveness.Â Â Â  \r\nAfter the State\r\n  concluded its case-in-chief, Landrum moved for a directed verdict.Â  Landrum\r\n  argued the State did not meet its burden of creating a jury issue for assault\r\n  upon a state or local correctional employee, and the evidence proved he acted in\r\n  self-defense.Â  Also, Landrum requested a jury charge of simple assault as a\r\n  lesser included offense of section 16-3-630.Â  The trial court denied Landrum's\r\n  directed verdict motion and refused to charge simple assault as a lesser included\r\n  offense.Â  The jury convicted Landrum of assault upon a state or local\r\n  correctional employee.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law\r\n  only. State\r\n    v. Martucci, 380 S.C. 232, 246, 669 S.E.2d 598, 605-06 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2008).Â  This court is bound by the trial court's\r\n  factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. State v. Baccus, 367\r\n  S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220&nbsp;(2006).Â  This court does not reevaluate\r\n  the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply\r\n  determines whether the trial judge's ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  State\r\n    v. Moore, 374 S.C. 468, 473-74, 649 S.E.2d 84, 86 (Ct. App. 2007).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA. Self-Defense Jury Charge\r\nLandrum argues he was entitled to a charge of\r\n  self-defense pursuant to State v. Williams, 367 S.C. 192, 624 S.E. 2d\r\n  443 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn Williams,\r\n  this court held that under the appropriate circumstances, an individual has the\r\n  right to utilize the amount of resistance reasonably necessary to defend\r\n  himself in the event excessive force is utilized incident to a lawful arrest.Â  367\r\n  S.C. at 199, 624 S.E.2d at 447.Â  However, to warrant a self-defense instruction,\r\n  the evidence must clearly show the accused fully complied with all requirements\r\n  placed upon citizens subject to a lawful arrest and resisted only to the extent\r\n  necessary to protect himself from serious physical harm.Â  Id.\r\nWe believe Landrum's\r\n  reliance on Williams is misplaced.Â  After a review of the record, we conclude\r\n  there is no evidence Scott utilized excessive force against Landrum.Â  In fact, both\r\n  Scott and Wieder's testimony indicates Scott utilized the appropriate amount of\r\n  force against Landrum.Â  \r\nNext, we must\r\n  examine whether the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury on the law\r\n  of self-defense. \r\nA trial court is\r\n  required to charge only the current and correct law of this State.Â  State v.\r\n    Harris, 382 S.C. 107, 113, 674 S.E.2d 532, 535&nbsp;(Ct App. 2009).Â  The\r\n  law to be charged to the jury is determined by the evidence presented at\r\n  trial.Â  State v. Brown, 362 S.C. 258, 262, 607 S.E.2d 93, 95&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 2004).Â  If any evidence supports a jury charge, the trial court should\r\n  grant the request.Â  Id.Â  A self-defense charge is not required unless it\r\n  is supported by the evidence.Â  State v. Slater,&nbsp;373 S.C. 66, 69,\r\n  644 S.E.2d 50, 52&nbsp;(2007).Â  \r\nTo establish\r\n  self-defense, the law requires that (1) the defendant be without fault in\r\n  bringing on the difficulty; (2) the defendant have been in actual imminent\r\n  danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury, or he actually\r\n  believed he was in imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily\r\n  injury; (3) the defendant show that a reasonably prudent person of ordinary\r\n  firmness and courage would have entertained the belief that he was actually in\r\n  imminent danger and that the circumstances were such would warrant a person of\r\n  ordinary prudence, firmness, and courage to strike the fatal blow in order to\r\n  save himself from serious bodily harm or the loss of his life if his defense is\r\n  based upon imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily\r\n  injury; and (4) the defendant had no other probable means of avoiding the\r\n  danger. Â State v. Jackson, 384 S.C. 29, 35-36, 681 S.E.2d 17, 20 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2009). \r\nAfter a careful\r\n  review of the record, we conclude the trial court did not err in refusing to\r\n  charge self-defense.Â  The record does not support a self-defense charge as\r\n  requested by Landrum.Â  The only witnesses that testified in the record were\r\n  Scott, Dr. McCord, Wieder, and Lieutenant McDaniels.Â  Of them, only Scott was\r\n  an eye-witness.Â  Scott testified Landrum was the first aggressor and repeatedly\r\n  instructed Landrum to return to his cell.Â  See Slater, 373 S.C. at\r\n  71, 644 S.E.2d at 53 (holding appellant was not entitled to a self-defense\r\n  charge where the record showed the defendant was the first aggressor and was,\r\n  therefore not without fault in bringing on the difficulty).Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  affirm the trial court's decision not to charge the jury on self-defense.\r\nB. Lesser Included Offense\r\nLandrum contends the trial court erred in refusing to\r\n  charge simple assault as a lesser included offense of assault upon a state or\r\n  local correctional employee.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn refusing to\r\n  charge simple assault as a lesser included offense of assault upon a state or\r\n  local correctional employee, the trial court reasoned the statute does not\r\n  distinguish between simple assault and aggravated assault.Â  However, we\r\n  conclude the Legislature specifically intended to define and target this\r\n  specific societal problem of protecting correctional employees by amending and\r\n  adding section 16-3-630 to the South Carolina Code in 1997.Â  See generally State v. Mitchell, 362 S.C. 289, 297, 608 S.E.2d 140, 144 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005) (overruled on other grounds) (supporting trial court's finding that\r\n  involuntary manslaughter was not a lesser included offense of homicide by child\r\n  abuse by acknowledging that the Legislature's creation of a specific statute\r\n  addressing homicide by child abuse was an effort to define and target that\r\n  specific societal problem).Â  \r\nMoreover, even if\r\n  the Legislature did not intend to specifically target the offense of assault\r\n  upon a correctional officer, and simple assault is a lesser included offense,\r\n  we find no reversible error in failing to charge simple assault.Â Â  The only\r\n  evidence is that the victim was a correctional employee performing his job at\r\n  the time of the assault.Â  See State v. Davis, 374 S.C. 581, 585,\r\n  649 S.E.2d 132, 134&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2007) (â€œTo warrant reversal,\r\n  a trial court's refusal to give a requested jury charge must be both erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant.&quot;)Â  Thus, we conclude the trial court did not err in\r\n  refusing to charge simple assault as a lesser included offense of assault upon\r\n  a state or local correctional employee. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  trial court's decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS, PIEPER,\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] According to Scott's testimony, a gray bin is a\r\n  plastic storage container in which personal belongings can be stored.Â  \r\n[3] The yellow line is a protective barrier for the\r\n  corrections officers.Â  Inmates are not allowed to cross the yellow line unless\r\n  inmates are invited to exit the pod or to conduct business.Â  \r\n[4] A palm heel strike is a defensive technique designed\r\n  to stop forward momentum, create distance, and allow a person to complete\r\n  another technique.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-219","title":"Wingate v.

Greeley, of Rock Hill, for\r\n  Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â In this\r\n  shareholder dispute, Chet A. Wingate, Jr. appeals the trial court's denial of\r\n  his motion for a new trial nisi additur or new trial absolute, arguing\r\n  that the damages awarded to him by the jury were inadequate in light of the\r\n  evidence presented at trial.Â  Wingate also appeals the trial court's decision\r\n  to award four Carolina Panthers personal seat licenses to Executive Designs,\r\n  Inc. (EDI), contending that the trial court erred by finding that Wingate used\r\n  corporate assets to purchase the licenses.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nEDI\r\n  was incorporated in South Carolina on March 8, 2001 for the purposes of\r\n  engaging in the business of embroidering apparel.Â  The corporation, which was\r\n  located in Clover, South Carolina, was formed by three shareholders: Wingate;\r\n  Robin Leonard; and Michael Gray.Â  Wingate and Leonard each owned 45% of the\r\n  shares of EDI's stock, while Gray owned 10%.Â  Wingate, who had previously\r\n  worked at his father's business, Kenda Knits, doing embroidery work, served as\r\n  President of EDI and was responsible for the day-to-day management of the corporation.[1]Â \r\n  Leonard and Gray, who were brothers-in-law, resided in Virginia, and they\r\n  visited EDI's factory infrequently.Â  \r\nA\r\n  few days after EDI was incorporated, Wingate, Leonard and Gray entered into a\r\n  Shareholder Management Agreement, in which they agreed that no debt would be\r\n  incurred on behalf of the corporation absent a resolution of the shareholders.Â \r\n  Shortly thereafter, Wingate obtained, on EDI's behalf, a $25,000 line of credit\r\n  from First Union, which later became Wachovia.Â  Wingate, who has a master's\r\n  degree in business, personally guaranteed the line of credit despite the fact\r\n  that he was a minority shareholder of EDI.Â  Although no shareholder resolution\r\n  authorizing the loan was officially adopted, Leonard testified that both his\r\n  signature and Gray's signature were on the signature cards for the loan.Â \r\n  However, Leonard's testimony was contradicted in part by that of Gray, who\r\n  testified that he was not aware of the Wachovia line of credit.Â  \r\nSubsequently,\r\n  Wingate obtained in EDI's name (and personally guaranteed) the following loans\r\n  from Provident Community Bank (Provident): (i) in September 2001, a $50,000\r\n  line of credit;[2] (ii) in July 2002, a $60,000 closed-end loan; and (iii) in June 2003, another\r\n  $100,000 line of credit.Â  According to Leonard and Gray, they did not authorize\r\n  any of these loans from Provident.Â  \r\nLess\r\n  than a week after finalizing the $100,000 line of credit from Provident, Wingate\r\n  purchased, for an aggregate sum of $15,000, four Carolina Panthers personal\r\n  seat licenses (PSLs) for his own personal use.Â  Wingate admitted at trial that\r\n  he bought the PSLs using an EDI corporate check.Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  managing EDI, Wingate routinely used corporate credit cards to purchase\r\n  merchandise from vendors. Â According to Wingate, about ten to fifteen percent\r\n  of EDI's vendors required that credit cards be used to purchase merchandise.Â \r\n  Wingate also testified that he used his personal credit card to make purchases\r\n  on behalf of EDI.Â  \r\nFor\r\n  approximately the first two years of EDI's existence, William Newton, a friend\r\n  of Wingate's, acted as the corporation's accountant.Â  However, in early 2003,\r\n  he was forced to leave his position due to illness.[3]Â \r\n  In the spring of that year, Charlotte Allen was hired by Leonard to prepare EDI's\r\n  2002 tax return and to perform other accounting work for the corporation.Â  She\r\n  began corresponding with Wingate and Wingate's secretary, Patricia Burgess, to\r\n  obtain the financial data she needed to prepare the 2002 return.Â  The return\r\n  was filed in September 2003.Â  \r\nOn October 1, 2003,\r\n  Leonard and Gray traveled to Clover and met with Wingate over lunch.Â  During\r\n  that meeting, they agreed to move all of EDI's corporate records to Virginia,\r\n  where Allen resided.Â  Two days later, Leonard sent an email to Wingate thanking\r\n  him for the visit and informing him that they would be back on October 14th to pick up certain items.Â  \r\nOn October 14,\r\n  2003, Leonard and Gray traveled to South Carolina, arriving before lunch.Â \r\n  Based upon a conversation that they had with an EDI employee, they decided to\r\n  go to the York County courthouse to ascertain whether any UCC filings had been\r\n  filed against EDI.Â  According to Leonard and Gray, they discovered that two UCC\r\n  filings from two different financial institutions had been filed on EDI's\r\n  equipment.Â  They also discovered that a UCC filing had been filed against\r\n  Classic Apparelâ€”a company formerly owned by Wingate that had been dissolved in September\r\n  2000â€”with respect to the inventory located at EDI's factory.Â  \r\nBelieving that\r\n  Wingate was engaged in bank fraud, Leonard and Gray decided to terminate\r\n  Wingate.Â  That afternoon, they arrived at EDI's factory accompanied by two York\r\n  County sheriff's deputies.Â  Leonard entered the factory and asked Wingate to\r\n  help him with something that he had in his vehicle.Â  When Wingate walked\r\n  outside, Leonard told Wingate that his services were no longer needed and that\r\n  he was fired.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  October 18, 2003, Leonard and Gray held a shareholder's meeting in which they\r\n  voted to cancel Wingate's stock ownership.Â  Wingate was not notified of the\r\n  meeting, but he was later informed that his shares had been voided.Â  Karen\r\n  Pocta, a longtime customer of both Kenda Knits and EDI, testified that when she\r\n  called and inquired about Wingate, she was told by Gray that Wingate was no\r\n  longer employed with EDI because he had been embezzling funds. \r\nIn\r\n  December 2003, Wingate filed a complaint against EDI, Leonard, Gray and Allen,\r\n  alleging ten causes of action, including breach of fiduciary duty and\r\n  defamation per se.[4]Â \r\n  The complaint also alleged two wage claims, one against EDI and the other\r\n  against Leonard and Gray.Â  EDI subsequently filed a counterclaim against\r\n  Wingate, contending breach of fiduciary duty and conversion.Â  Leonard and Gray\r\n  also filed counterclaims, arguing fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and\r\n  conversion.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  trial was held the week of October 23, 2006.Â  At trial, Wingate presented\r\n  evidence showing that Provident had obtained a judgment of $130,121.98 against\r\n  him after EDI defaulted on the Provident loans.Â  He also testified that, since\r\n  being ousted from EDI, he had been paying $482.05 each month for the Wachovia\r\n  line of credit.Â  He further testified that he had paid off credit card charges\r\n  that he had incurred on behalf of EDI.Â  Altogether, Wingate testified that he\r\n  had paid approximately $30,000 in corporate debts since he had been terminated\r\n  from EDIâ€”a figure that did not include the Provident judgment, which he was\r\n  still contesting.Â  \r\nRespondents,\r\n  in turn, presented evidence showing that the debts incurred by Wingate were not\r\n  properly authorized.Â  Leonard testified that there were no shareholder\r\n  resolutions authorizing Wingate to incur indebtedness on behalf of the\r\n  corporation.Â  He further testified that the only time he mentioned credit cards\r\n  to Wingate was when he told Wingate that no credit cards were needed.Â  In\r\n  addition, Gray testified that he never authorized the Provident loans or any of\r\n  the credit card charges that Wingate claimed he had incurred on behalf of EDI.Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Respondents presented evidence demonstrating that Wingate had opened a\r\n  corporate Advanta credit card account in Leonard's name without Leonard's\r\n  knowledge and that the balance on the card as of September 9, 2003 was nearly\r\n  $16,000.Â  They also presented evidence that Wingate submitted falsified\r\n  invoices to Provident in order to obtain short-term credit under EDI's accounts\r\n  receivable factoring arrangement with Provident.[5]Â \r\n  Furthermore, Allen testified that, according to her records, Wingate had\r\n  withdrawn &quot;somewhere in excess of $200,000&quot; from EDI.[6]Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  Respondents introduced evidence showing that EDI had performed poorly during\r\n  its first two and half years of existence.Â  Allen testified that, for the nine\r\n  month period ending September 30, 2003, EDI suffered a net loss of\r\n  $100,838.79.Â  Additionally, Leonard testified that there was no profit in 2002\r\n  despite a million dollars in gross sales, and Gray testified that he never\r\n  received any distribution of profits.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  jury ultimately found for Wingate with regard to his claims against Leonard and\r\n  Gray for breach of fiduciary duty and defamation per se, and he was awarded\r\n  $1.00 in actual damages and no punitive damages for each of those two claims.[7]Â \r\n  As to Wingate's two wage claims, the jury found against Wingate.Â  The jury also\r\n  found against Wingate with respect to all five of the counterclaims filed\r\n  against him, and it awarded $1.00 in actual damages and no punitive damages for\r\n  each of those counterclaims.Â  \r\nWingate\r\n  thereafter filed a motion for a new trial nisi additur or, in the\r\n  alternative, a new trial absolute, arguing that the damages awarded to him were\r\n  inadequate.Â  Additionally, EDI, Leonard and Gray moved for an order judicially\r\n  dissolving EDI, valuing the shares of EDI, and declaring the four Carolina\r\n  Panthers PSLs possessed by Wingate to be the property of EDI.Â  On December 13,\r\n  2006, the trial court issued an order denying Wingate's motion for a new trial nisi\r\n    additur or new trial absolute. Â Additionally, pursuant to sections\r\n  33-14-300 and 33-14-310 of the South Carolina Code (2006), the trial court\r\n  judicially dissolved EDI, valued the shares of EDI at zero, and awarded the\r\n  four Carolina Panthers PSLs to EDI.Â  Wingate now appeals.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Denial of Motion for New\r\n  Trial Absolute or New Trial Nisi Additur\r\nThe trial\r\n  court's failure to grant Wingate's motion for a new trial absolute or new trial nisi additur did not constitute reversible error.Â  &quot;The grant or\r\n  denial of new trial motions rests within the discretion of the trial judge and\r\n  his decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless his findings are wholly\r\n  unsupported by the evidence or the conclusions reached are controlled by error\r\n  of law.&quot;Â  Vinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 405, 477 S.E.2d 715, 723\r\n  (Ct. App. 1996). \r\nA\r\n  jury's determination of damages must be accorded &quot;substantial deference.&quot;Â  Chapman v. Upstate RV &amp; Marine, 364 S.C. 82, 89, 610 S.E.2d 852, 856\r\n  (Ct. App. 2005).Â  &quot;[I]t is the duty of the court to sustain verdicts when\r\n  a logical reason for reconciling them can be found.&quot; Â Daves v. Cleary,\r\n  355 S.C. 216, 231, 584 S.E.2d 423, 430 (Ct. App. 2003). Â A new trial absolute\r\n  should be granted &quot;only if the amount is so grossly inadequate or\r\n  excessive so as to shock the conscience of the court and clearly indicates the\r\n  figure reached was the result of passion, caprice, prejudice, partiality,\r\n  corruption or some other improper motives.&quot;Â  RRR, Inc. v. Toggas,\r\n  378 S.C. 174, 182, 662 S.E.2d 438, 442&nbsp; (Ct. App. 2008).Â  Similarly, a new trial nisi additur should not be granted absent &quot;[c]ompelling\r\n  reasons.&quot;Â  Vinson, 324 S.C. at 405, 477 S.E.2d at 723. \r\nA\r\n  verdict that assesses liability against the defendant but does not award the\r\n  plaintiff any damages is inconsistent and contrary to South Carolina\r\n  law.Â  Stevens v. Allen, 342 S.C. 47, 53, 536 S.E.2d 663, 666 (2000).Â  However,\r\n  a verdict that assesses liability against the defendant and awards the\r\n  plaintiff nominal damages such as one dollar is not necessarily improper.Â  The\r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court has upheld such jury awards.Â  See Harrison\r\n    v. Bevilacqua, 354 S.C. 129, 140-41, 580 S.E.2d 109, 115 (2003) (upholding\r\n  jury award of $1.00).Â  \r\nHere, Wingate claims\r\n  that the $2.00 in total damages that he was awarded with respect to his breach\r\n  of fiduciary duty and defamation per se causes of action was inadequate and\r\n  inconsistent given that he presented evidence showing that he had been damaged\r\n  in the following amounts: (1) wages unpaid by EDI in the amount of $70,940.00;\r\n  (2) Provident judgment in the amount of $135,000;[8] and (3) debts unpaid by Respondents that were paid by Wingate in the amount of $58,000.[9]\r\nHowever,\r\n  regarding the first amount, the jury specifically found against Wingate with\r\n  respect to his wage claims.Â  Thus, the jury's failure to award Wingate any\r\n  damages in connection with those claims was clearly not inconsistent.Â  As to the\r\n  last two amounts, the jury may have concluded that any damages owed to Wingate\r\n  as a result of Leonard and Gray's actions were essentially balanced out by the\r\n  damages owed to Leonard, Gray and EDI as a result of Wingate's actions.Â  As\r\n  noted above, the jury found for Leonard, Gray and EDI on all five of the\r\n  counterclaims they collectively filed against Wingate, yet it only awarded them\r\n  a total of $5.00.Â  Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not commit\r\n  reversible error by failing to grant Wingate's motion for a new trial absolute\r\n  or new trial nisi additur.\r\nII.&nbsp; Award of Four Carolina\r\n  Panthers PSLs to EDI\r\nAdditionally, the trial court did not err by awarding\r\n  the four Carolina Panthers PSLs to EDI.Â  It is undisputed that Wingate\r\n  purchased the PSLs by using an EDI corporate check.Â  Although Wingate claims\r\n  that the $15,000 that he used to purchase the PSLs was a return of capital\r\n  contributions he had made to EDI, he has not pointed to any\r\n  contemporaneously-prepared accounting record or other financial document that\r\n  corroborates his claim.[10]Â \r\n  Moreover, the evidence presented by Respondents regarding the Advanta credit\r\n  card and the falsified invoices put Wingate's overall credibility in doubt.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we conclude that the most reasonable inference to make from the evidence\r\n  presented is that Wingate used corporate assets to purchase the PSLs.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Wingate and\r\n  Leonard originally met when Kenda Knits performed embroidery work for Leonard's\r\n  employer.Â  \r\n[2] That line of\r\n  credit was subsequently paid off in October 2002 and replaced with a new $48,649.80\r\n  loan.Â  \r\n[3] Newton later died\r\n  on January 10, 2004.Â  \r\n[4] Wingate's\r\n  complaint was later amended to add Mid-Atlantic Embroidery &amp; Apparel, Inc. (Mid-Atlantic)\r\n  as a defendant and to allege two additional causes of action.Â  Mid-Atlantic was\r\n  a corporation formed by Leonard, Gray and Allen in the spring of 2004.Â  \r\n[5] Under the\r\n  factoring arrangement, at the time EDI sent an invoice to a customer, it would\r\n  also send a copy of the invoice to Provident.Â  Provident would then forward EDI\r\n  87% of the invoice amount by noon the next day.Â  Once the customer paid the\r\n  invoice (payments were sent to Provident), Provident would then forward EDI the\r\n  remaining amount of the invoice, minus a small financing fee.Â Â  \r\n[6]Â  Although\r\n  Wingate testified that he made capital contributions to EDI that were in excess\r\n  to the amounts he withdrew from the corporation, Allen testified that she was\r\n  unable to find any documentation in EDI's corporate financial records that\r\n  showed Wingate's contributions to EDI.Â  \r\n[7] At the\r\n  conclusion of Wingate's case in chief, the trial court dismissed the causes of\r\n  action against Allen.Â  Wingate has not appealed that ruling.Â Â  \r\n[8] The $135,000\r\n  figure appears to include interest charges incurred on the $130,121.98\r\n  Provident judgment.Â  The Provident judgment, which was issued on August 24,\r\n  2004, required that &quot;interest at the judgment rate&quot; be paid until the\r\n  $130,121.98 amount was paid in full.Â  \r\n[9] It is unclear exactly\r\n  how Wingate derived the $58,000 figure.Â  As noted above, at trial, Wingate\r\n  testified that he had paid approximately $30,000 in corporate debts since he\r\n  had been terminated.Â  \r\n[10] Although\r\n  Plaintiff's Exhibit 12, a spreadsheet that purportedly shows Wingate's capital\r\n  contributions and withdrawals, identifies the $15,000 used to purchase the PSLs\r\n  as a withdrawal of Wingate's contributions, it is undated and does not, on its\r\n  face, appear to be an EDI corporate record.Â  Moreover, as noted above, Allen\r\n  testified that she was unable to find anything in EDI's corporate financial\r\n  records that documented Wingate's alleged contributions to EDI.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-220","title":"State v.
