Nance, of Nance, McCants, & Massey, of\r\n             Aiken, for Respondent/Appellant.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: These cross-appeals arise from a bench trial awarding damages\r\nand a permanent injunction to Jake E. Cupstid in his trespass action against Jimmie\r\nD. Fogle. Fogle appeals, arguing the circuit court erred in (1) holding Cupstid is\r\nnot required to prove he held legal title to the property at issue; (2) failing to find\r\n\nCupstid is estopped to claim any interest in the disputed property; (3) permitting\r\nCupstid to present an expert to testify about the law; and (4) awarding Cupstid\r\nactual damages, punitive damages, and a permanent injunction. Fogle further\r\nmaintains the circuit court's clerk of court erred in entering costs before entering\r\nthe final judgment. Cupstid appeals the amount of actual damages awarded. We\r\naffirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities:\r\n\r\n1. As to whether the circuit court erred in holding Cupstid is not required to prove\r\nhe held legal title to the property: Godfrey v. Heller, 311 S.C. 516, 520, 429 S.E.2d\r\n859, 862 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding a party failed to preserve an alleged error in an\r\norder when the party failed to raise the issue in a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion).\r\n\r\n2. As to whether the circuit court erred in failing to find Cupstid is estopped to\r\nclaim that he held title to the disputed property: Hollis v. Stonington Dev., LLC,\r\n394 S.C. 383, 406, 714 S.E.2d 904, 916 (Ct. App. 2011) (providing issues must be\r\nraised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appeal).\r\n\r\n3. As to whether the circuit court erred in permitting Cupstid to present an expert\r\nto testify about the law: Bodiford v. Spanish Oak Farms, Inc., 317 S.C. 539, 543,\r\n455 S.E.2d 194, 196 (Ct. App. 1995) (holding a surveyor could testify as to an\r\nultimate issue in a trial before a special referee because the surveyor had been\r\nordered to report his findings to the court and the special referee could decide the\r\nappropriate weight to give to the testimony); see also Brown v. Allstate Ins. Co.,\r\n344 S.C. 21, 25-27, 542 S.E.2d 723, 725-26 (2001) (rejecting a holding by the\r\ncourt of appeals that a trial court committed harmful error in admitting \"a\r\npotpourri\" of inadmissible evidence addressing the ultimate issue in a bench trial\r\nbecause such a rule was \"unnecessarily burdensome and would inhibit the trial\r\njudge's ability to evaluate the evidence and ascertain the truth\"; the appellant failed\r\nto make \"a sufficient showing the trial judge either affirmatively relied on the\r\nincompetent evidence, or could not have reached the same result without relying\r\non the incompetent evidence\").\r\n\r\n4. As to whether the circuit court erred in granting actual damages, punitive\r\ndamages, and the permanent injunction because Cupstid failed to prove title: Cedar\r\nCove Homeowners Ass'n, Inc. v. DiPietro, 368 S.C. 254, 258, 628 S.E.2d 284, 286\r\n(Ct. App. 2006) (\"[A] trespass action is one at law . . . .\"); Townes Assocs. Ltd. v.\r\nGreenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976) (\"In an action at law, on\r\nappeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be\r\ndisturbed upon appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably\r\nsupports the judge's findings.\"); Gowdy v. Gibson, 391 S.C. 374, 385, 706 S.E.2d\r\n\n495, 501 (2011) (noting the circuit court in a bench trial is in a better position than\r\nthe appellate court to evaluate the credibility of the evidence); Bodiford, 317 S.C.\r\nat 543 n.1, 455 S.E.2d at 197 n.1 (providing in a boundary dispute that \"resort is\r\ngenerally had first to natural boundaries, next to artificial monuments, then to\r\nadjacent boundaries, and last to courses and distances,\" but the rule does not\r\nmandate an order of consideration or admissibility; rather, \"[t]he rules for\r\ndetermining disputed boundaries . . . are subject to modification depending upon\r\nthe particular facts of each case,\" and \"[t]he facts of a case may therefore require\r\nthat an inferior means of location be preferred over a higher means of location\").\r\n\r\n5. As to Fogle's argument that the circuit court erred in granting actual damages\r\nbecause section 16-11-615 of the South Carolina Code (2003) limited Cupstid's\r\nrecovery: Godfrey, 311 S.C. at 520, 429 S.E.2d at 862 (holding a party failed to\r\npreserve an alleged error in an order when the party failed to raise the issue in a\r\nRule 59(e) motion).\r\n\r\n6. As to Fogle's argument that the circuit court erred in granting punitive damages\r\nbecause Cupstid failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Fogle\r\nrecklessly, willfully, or intentionally invaded Cupstid's rights: Wimberly v. Barr,\r\n359 S.C. 414, 423, 597 S.E.2d 853, 858 (Ct. App. 2004) (\"Punitive damages may\r\nbe awarded for trespass when a defendant's acts have been willful, wanton or in\r\nreckless disregard of the rights of another.\"); see also Joyner v. St. Matthews\r\nBuilders, 263 S.C. 136, 139-40, 208 S.E.2d 48, 49 (1974) (\"[W]e cannot say that\r\nsuch was not susceptible of a reasonable inference that St. Matthews Builders, or\r\nDent, was proceeding in reckless disregard of, or with a conscious failure to\r\nexercise due care as to, plaintiff's property and rights.\"); Black's Law Dictionary\r\n1385 (9th ed. 2009) (defining \"recklessness\" as \"[c]onduct whereby the actor does\r\nnot desire harmful consequence but nonetheless foresees the possibility and\r\nconsciously takes the risk\").\r\n\r\n7. As to Cupstid's argument that the circuit court erred in awarding $20,000 of\r\nactual damages because the trees' replacement cost is the proper measure of\r\ndamages: Godfrey, 311 S.C. at 520, 429 S.E.2d at 862 (holding that a party failed\r\nto preserve an alleged error in an order when the party failed to raise the issue in a\r\nRule 59(e) motion).\r\n\r\n8. As to Fogle's argument that the circuit court clerk erred in awarding costs to\r\nCupstid: Jones ex rel. Jones v. Enter. Leasing Co.–Southeast, 383 S.C. 259, 268\r\nn.6, 678 S.E.2d 819, 824 n.6 (Ct. App. 2009) (holding an issue was not preserved\r\n\nfor appeal because no new issues may be raised to this court by the appellant in the\r\nappellant's reply brief).\r\n\r\n      AFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\n      WILLIAMS, THOMAS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-501","title":"Windham v.

Hurst argues the ALC erred in finding (1) substantial\r\nevidence supported the Board's decision and (2) the Board's decision was not\r\narbitrary. We affirm.1\r\n\r\n\"Misconduct which constitutes grounds for revocation, suspension, probation,\r\nreprimand, or other restriction of a [dentistry] license or certificate . . . occurs when\r\nthe holder of a license or certificate: . . . (2) has been convicted of a felony . . . .\"\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 40-15-190(A) (2011). \"If the [B]oard is satisfied that the dentist\r\n. . . is guilty of an offense charged in the formal accusation provided for in this\r\nchapter, it may revoke or suspend the license . . . , reprimand the dentist, . . . or\r\ntake other reasonable action short of revocation or suspension . . . .\" S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 40-15-200 (2011).\r\n\r\nWe hold the ALC did not err in finding the record contains substantial evidence to\r\nsupport the Board's decision to deny Hurst's petition to terminate the probationary\r\nconditions placed on his dental license. \"In determining whether the [ALC's]\r\ndecision was supported by substantial evidence, this [c]ourt need only find, looking\r\nat the entire record on appeal, evidence from which reasonable minds could reach\r\nthe same conclusion that the [ALC] reached.\" Hill v. S.C. Dep't of Health & Envtl.\r\nControl, 389 S.C. 1, 9-10, 698 S.E.2d 612, 617 (2010). \"The mere possibility of\r\ndrawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent a finding\r\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\" Id. at 10, 698 S.E.2d at 617\r\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). At the hearing before the Board,\r\nHurst admitted to having pled guilty to committing a lewd act upon a child under\r\nsixteen. Because committing a lewd act upon a child under sixteen is a felony, the\r\nBoard had discretion to place and keep the conditions on Hurst's license pursuant\r\nto section 40-15-200. See S.C. Code Ann. § 16-15-140 (2003) (providing a person\r\nwho is guilty of committing or attempting to commit a lewd act upon a child under\r\nsixteen is guilty of a felony). Additionally, nothing in the order out of which this\r\nappeal arises or any other order the Board issued indicates Hurst's conditions\r\nwould be removed after compliance for a specified time period. Accordingly, the\r\nrecord contains substantial evidence to support the Board's decision.\r\n\r\nWe hold the ALC correctly found the Board's decision was not arbitrary. \"A\r\ndecision is arbitrary if it is without a rational basis, is based alone on one's will and\r\n\r\n1   We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\nnot upon any course of reasoning and exercise of judgment, is made at pleasure,\r\nwithout adequate determining principles, or is governed by no fixed rules or\r\nstandards.\" Deese v.

Here, the Board had discretion to take any \"reasonable\r\naction short of revocation or suspension\" pursuant to section 40-15-200 because\r\nHurst pled guilty to committing a lewd act upon a child under sixteen, a felony.\r\nBecause refusing to terminate Hurst's probationary conditions was such an action,\r\nthe ALC correctly found the Board did not act arbitrarily.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and WILLIAMS and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-503","title":"James v.

Allison, of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n\n      PER CURIAM: Luther Harris (Employee) appeals the order of the\r\nAppellate Panel of the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission\r\n(Appellate Panel), arguing the Appellate Panel erred in (1) holding Employee\r\ndid not suffer a change of condition, (2) stating that objective evidence is\r\nrequired for a finding of change of condition, and (3) issuing an order that\r\nfailed to comply with section 1-23-350 of the South Carolina Code (2005).\r\nWe affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR.1\r\n\r\n       1.   We find substantial evidence supports the Appellate Panel's\r\nholding that Employee did not suffer a change of condition. See Hall v.\r\nDesert Aire, Inc., 376 S.C. 338, 347, 656 S.E.2d 753, 757 (Ct. App. 2007)\r\n(\"It is not within the reviewing court's province to reverse findings of the\r\nAppellate Panel which are supported by substantial evidence.\"); id. at 348,\r\n656 S.E.2d at 758 (\"The possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions\r\nfrom the evidence does not prevent [the Appellate Panel]'s findings from\r\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\"); id. (\"Where there are conflicts in\r\nthe evidence over a factual issue, the findings of the Appellate Panel are\r\nconclusive.\").\r\n\r\n      2.    We find the Appellate Panel did not commit reversible error in\r\nstating that objective evidence is required for a finding of change of\r\ncondition. The record reflects that the Appellate Panel applied the\r\nappropriate legal standard in reviewing Employee's request for additional\r\nbenefits and, as stated above, substantial evidence supports the Appellate\r\nPanel's determination.\r\n\r\n      3.    We find the Appellate Panel's order complies with section 1-23-\r\n350 of the South Carolina Code (2005). See Martinez v. Spartanburg Cnty.,\r\n394 S.C. 224, 230, 715 S.E.2d 339, 342 (Ct.

Daniel Addison, of Hedrick Gardner Kincheloe &\r\n            Garofalo, LLP, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Linda Griffin (Employee) appeals the order of the Appellate\r\nPanel of the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission (Appellate\r\nPanel) awarding her permanent partial disability benefits. On appeal, Employee\r\nargues the Appellate Panel erred in (1) finding she reached maximum medical\r\n\nimprovement (MMI) on January 5, 2011; (2) finding she was not entitled to\r\nDodge1 medical benefits; (3) finding her psychological overlay was not causally-\r\nrelated to her back injury; and (4) violating her due process rights. We affirm.2\r\n\r\n1. We find substantial evidence supports the Appellate Panel's finding Employee\r\nreached MMI on January 5, 2011. See Hall v. United Rentals, Inc., 371 S.C. 69,\r\n89, 636 S.E.2d 876, 887 (Ct. App. 2006) (\"MMI is a factual determination left to\r\nthe discretion of the [Appellate] [P]anel. It is not within our province to reverse\r\nfindings of the [A]ppellate [P]anel which are supported by substantial evidence.\"\r\n(citation and quotation marks omitted)). Here, Dr. Rakesh Chokshi, Employee's\r\ntreating physician for more than three years, determined on January 5, 2011, that\r\nEmployee, who suffered from chronic back pain, had reached MMI. He also found\r\nthat Employee \"may need pain management long term.\" However, Dr. Chokshi\r\nnever determined further medical treatment would lessen Employee's disability.\r\nSee id. (\"MMI is a term used to indicate that a person has reached such a plateau\r\nthat, in the physician's opinion, no further medical care or treatment will lessen the\r\nperiod of impairment.\"). Accordingly, the Appellate Panel did not err.\r\n\r\n2. We find the Appellate Panel properly denied Employee's request for continuing\r\nmedical benefits. Employee offered no medical evidence stating to a reasonable\r\ndegree of medical certainty that further medical treatment would lessen her period\r\nof disability. See S.C. Code Ann. § 42-15-60(A) (Supp. 2011) (providing \"[t]he\r\nemployer shall provide medical . . . treatment . . . for a period not exceeding ten\r\nweeks from the date of an injury, to effect a cure or give relief and for an\r\nadditional time as in the judgment of the [Appellate Panel] will tend to lessen the\r\nperiod of disability as evidenced by expert medical evidence stated to a reasonable\r\ndegree of medical certainty\"); see also Dodge, 334 S.C. at 580, 514 S.E.2d at 596\r\n(\"[Section 42-15-60(A)] clearly allows the [Appellate Panel] to award medical\r\nbenefits beyond [ten] weeks from the date of injury only where the [Appellate\r\nPanel] determines such medical treatment would tend to lessen the period of\r\ndisability.\" (citation and quotation marks omitted)). In this case, the only medical\r\nevidence concerning future medical treatment is Dr. Chokshi's testimony that\r\nEmployee \"may\" need long-term pain management. However, he never testified\r\nthat continuing medical treatment would lessen her period of disability.\r\nAccordingly, the Appellate Panel did not err.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Dodge v. Bruccoli, Clark, Layman, Inc., 334 S.C. 574, 514 S.E.2d 593 (Ct. App.\n\r\n1999).\n\r\n2 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \n\r\n\n3. We find the Appellate Panel did not err in finding Employee was not entitled to\r\nbenefits for her psychological overlay of anxiety and depression. Here, Employee\r\noffered no evidence her depression and anxiety were casually related to her back\r\ninjury. See Bass v. Kenco Grp., 366 S.C. 450, 465, 622 S.E.2d 577, 584-85 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2005) (\"[A] mental injury induced by a physical injury is compensable. . . . A\r\ncondition, which is induced by a physical injury, is thereby causally related to that\r\ninjury.\"). Furthermore, Dr. Janet Woolery, Employee's treating psychiatrist, noted\r\nEmployee had several personal stressors in her life. Moreover, Dr. Woolery made\r\nno finding that Employee's anxiety and depression were causally related to her\r\nback injury. Accordingly, the Appellate Panel did not err.\r\n\r\n4. We find Employee did not preserve her due process argument for our review\r\nbecause she did not raise the issue to the Appellate Panel. See Henderson v. F & D\r\nElec. Contractors, 306 S.C. 256, 257 n.1, 411 S.E.2d 225, 226 n.1 (Ct. App. 1991)\r\n(finding an issue is not preserved for appellate review when it was not raised to or\r\nruled upon by the Appellate Panel); Bakala v. Bakala, 352 S.C. 612, 625, 576\r\nS.E.2d 156, 163 (2003) (finding any due process issues cannot be raised for the\r\nfirst time on appeal). Accordingly, we affirm based on preservation.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nSHORT, KONDUROS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-518","title":"State v.

Sanders, Jr., PA, of\r\n             Fairfax, for Respondent Carolyn Diane Johnson.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Christopher L. Mew appeals a special referee's order quieting and\r\nconfirming title in favor of Carolyn Diane Johnson, arguing the special referee\r\nerred in finding a corrective deed can divest a fee simple absolute interest in real\r\nestate and in conducting the quiet title hearing without a court reporter. We\r\ndismiss. 1\r\n\r\n\"Service of the notice of intent to appeal is a jurisdictional requirement, and this\r\n[c]ourt has no authority to extend or expand the time in which the notice of intent\r\nto appeal must be served.\" Mears v. Mears, 287 S.C. 168, 169, 337 S.E.2d 206,\r\n207 (1985). \"The notice of appeal from an order or judgment issued by a master or\r\nspecial referee shall be served in the same manner as provided by Rule 203(b)(1).\"\r\nRule 203(b)(4), SCACR. \"A notice of appeal shall be served on all respondents\r\nwithin thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of entry of the order or\r\njudgment.\" Rule 203(b)(1), SCACR. \"A timely post-trial motion, including a\r\nmotion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, stays the\r\ntime for an appeal for all parties until receipt of written notice of entry of the order\r\ngranting or denying such motion.\" Elam v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 15,\r\n602 S.E.2d 772, 775 (2004) (emphasis added). Here, Mew failed to file a timely\r\nRule 59(e), SCRCP, motion. As a result, the time for Mew to file a notice of\r\nappeal from the special referee's order was never tolled and began to run when\r\nMew first received notice of the order quieting and confirming title. Because Mew\r\ndid not file his notice of appeal until June 27, 2011, well after thirty days had\r\nelapsed from the latest date he could have received notice of the initial order on\r\nMarch 4, 2011,2 his notice of appeal filing was not timely. Accordingly, we lack\r\njurisdiction and dismiss Mew's appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n2 Because Mew failed to appeal the finding that his Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion\r\nwas untimely, it is the law of the case. See Ulmer v. Ulmer, 369 S.C. 486, 490,\r\n632 S.E.2d 858, 861 (2006) (noting a portion of a judgment that is not appealed,\r\nright or wrong, becomes the law of the case). The special referee found Mew's\r\nMarch 15, 2011 Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion untimely; therefore, the latest date\r\nMew could have received notice of the special referee's order is March 4, 2011.\r\nSee Rule 59(e), SCRCP (noting a motion to alter or amend must be served not later\r\nthan ten days after receipt of written notice of the order).\r\n\nDISMISSED. \n\r\n\r\nSHORT, KONDUROS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-521","title":"State v.

Johnson, of Columbia, for\r\n        Respondent.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: Christopher Whitehead appeals from his convictions of murder\r\nand burglary in the first degree, arguing the trial court erred in (1) allowing into\r\nevidence the statements of his two non-testifying co-defendants without adequately\r\nredacting their claims of his involvement because it denied him of his right to\r\nconfront and cross-examine the witnesses; and (2) not directing a verdict acquitting\r\nhim of murder and burglary because the State's evidence established nothing more\r\nthan a mere suspicion of guilt.\r\n\r\nJosh Zoch died from multiple blunt force trauma to his head after being beaten\r\nwith a baseball bat the night of December 12, 2006. Zoch, Whitehead, Derrick\r\nMcDonald, and Robert Cannon all worked at the same Sonic Restaurant at one\r\ntime. McDonald and Cannon both gave statements to police admitting their and\r\nWhitehead's involvement in the murder. Whitehead, McDonald, and Cannon were\r\ntried together as co-defendants in May 2008. None of the three co-defendants\r\ntestified at trial. The jury found all three guilty, and the trial court sentenced\r\nWhitehead to two concurrent sentences of life without parole for murder and first-\r\ndegree burglary due to his 2005 guilty plea to attempted armed robbery. We affirm\r\npursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities:\r\n\r\n1.     As to Whitehead's argument that the trial court erred in allowing\r\nMcDonald's and Cannon's statements into evidence without adequately redacting\r\nthe portions of their statements implicating Whitehead because it denied him his\r\nright to confront and cross-examine the witnesses: State v. McDonald, Op. No.\r\n5033 (S.C. Ct. App. filed September 12, 2012) (finding the neutral phrase \"another\r\nperson\" inserted into Cannon's statement avoided any Bruton v. United States, 391\r\nU.S. 123 (1968), violation because the redacted statement only implicated the\r\nstatement's maker, and did not limit the participants to three, which would\r\nimplicate the three defendants on trial; therefore, the trial court properly allowed\r\nCannon's redacted statement into evidence).\r\n\r\n2.     As to Whitehead's argument that the trial court erred in not directing a\r\nverdict acquitting him of murder and burglary because the State's evidence only\r\nestablished a mere suspicion of guilt: State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 62, 502 S.E.2d\r\n63, 69 (1998) (stating the trial court is concerned with the existence of evidence\r\nrather than its weight when considering a directed verdict motion); State v.\r\nSanders, 388 S.C. 292, 299, 696 S.E.2d 592, 596 (Ct.

App. 1997)).\r\n\r\nMagruder's sole basis for setting aside the default judgment is that representations\r\nmade by Assistant Solicitor Harrison in her Affidavit to the effect that she had\r\n\"exhausted all known avenues to locate\" Magruder is false and fraudulent.\r\n\r\nSection 15-9-710 of the South Carolina Code (2005) authorizes the issuance of an\r\norder for service by publication when it appears by affidavit to an issuing officer\r\nthat (1) the defendant or interested party is a resident of this state but cannot, after\r\ndue diligence, be found within the state, and a cause of action exists against him; or\r\n(2) he is a non-resident but has property located within the state, and the state has\r\njurisdiction over the subject of the action.1 When the issuing officer is satisfied\r\nwith the affidavit, his decision to issue the order of publication is final, absent\r\nfraud or collusion.

In challenging the Affidavit,\r\nMagruder established that she was represented by counsel in her criminal cases for\r\nthe duration of this civil action and that the criminal division of the Solicitor's\r\noffice not only knew about but communicated with her counsel regarding the\r\ncriminal actions. On the other hand, Assistant Solicitor Harrison argues the\r\nprintouts attached to the Affidavit do not indicate that Harrison, who practiced in\r\nthe civil division, had access to information concerning Magruder's criminal\r\ncounsel. We reject the State's argument. The State, in particular the Solicitor, is\r\ncharged with knowledge of whatever facts were known to Harrison as well as\r\nwhatever facts were known to Harrison's fellow assistant solicitors. See Crystal\r\nIce Co. of Columbia, Inc. v. First Colonial Corp., 273 S.C. 306, 309, 257 S.E.2d\r\n496, 497 (1979) (\"It is well established that a principal is affected with constructive\r\n2In reaching the merits of this issue, we find meritless the State's argument that a\r\ntwo-year statute of limitations barred Magruder's motion to reopen the case.

Code Ann. §§ 15-3-20, -550 (2005).\r\n\"A civil action is commenced when the summons and complaint are filed with the\r\nclerk of court if actual service is accomplished within one hundred twenty days\r\nafter filing.\" § 15-3-20(B). To the extent a civil action was commenced in this\r\nmatter, the State commenced it on November 11, 2008, with the filing of its\r\nsummons and complaint. Magruder's June 11, 2010 filing was a motion in an\r\nexisting case, not pleadings commencing an independent civil action, as in\r\nHackworth v. Greenville County, 371 S.C. 99, 102, 637 S.E.2d 320, 322 (Ct. App.\r\n2006). Accordingly, the statute of limitations did not bar Magruder's motion.\r\n\nknowledge of all material facts of which his agent receives notice while acting\r\nwithin the scope of his authority.\"); see also Michigan v.

Sixth Amendment principles require that we impute the State's\r\nknowledge from one state actor to another.\").\r\n\r\nWe note South Carolina requires a movant seeking relief under Rule 60(b)(3) to\r\nestablish extrinsic fraud. See Raby Constr., L.L.P. v. Orr, 358 S.C. 10, 20, 594\r\nS.E.2d 478, 483 (2004) (\"South Carolina maintains the distinction between\r\nextrinsic and intrinsic fraud, even when the allegations are raised through a Rule\r\n60(b)(3) motion filed within one year of the entry of judgment.\"); see also\r\nChewning v. Ford Motor Co., 354 S.C. 72, 80, 579 S.E.2d 605, 610 (2003)\r\n(requiring extrinsic fraud as a basis for vacating a judgment (citing Bryan v. Bryan,\r\n220 S.C. 164, 167-68, 66 S.E.2d 609, 610 (1951))). Although at oral argument\r\nMagruder's counsel opined the fraud alleged in this case was intrinsic, we need not\r\nreach this distinction because (1) fraud is Magruder's sole theory for seeking relief\r\nand (2) we see no fraud of either sort.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances of this case, it seems that ordinary prudence would have\r\nled Assistant Solicitor Harrison to have inquired of her fellow assistant solicitor\r\nhandling the criminal cases as to his or her knowledge of Magruder's whereabouts.\r\nThe countervailing argument is that she showed reasonable diligence to serve\r\nMagruder at the only address Magruder furnished officers at the time of her arrest\r\nand that she had listed for her bond. In her challenge, Magruder makes no attempt\r\nto demonstrate where she resided at the time service by certified mail was\r\nattempted, nor has she shown that the person who signed for the mail at the New\r\nYork address was not authorized under Rule 4(d)(8), SCRCP,3 to receipt for it.\r\nShe simply states in her affidavit that she was not staying at the residence at the\r\ntime of the attempted service. Moreover, she has not shown that as to the\r\nSolicitor's office, her last known address was not the New York address. Finally,\r\nMagruder does not contend her attorney had authority to accept service of the\r\nforfeiture suit papers, or that contacting her attorney would have led to the\r\ndisclosure of her \"true\" residence. We, therefore, hold that fraud has not been\r\nshown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Rule 4(d)(8) requires the trial court to set aside a default judgment \"pursuant to\r\nRule 55(c) or Rule 60(b) if the defendant demonstrates to the court that the return\r\nreceipt was signed by an unauthorized person.\"\r\n\nWhile we heartily disagree with the State's characterization of Magruder's\r\nargument on appeal as \"frivolous,\" Magruder failed to demonstrate the State acted\r\neither recklessly or intentionly in making the inaccurate statements in the\r\nAffidavit. Accordingly, Magruder failed to establish fraud in the procurement of\r\nthe order of publication, and we must affirm the circuit court's decision not to set\r\naside the default judgment.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nPIEPER and GEATHERS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-528","title":"State v.

(Father) appeals the family court's order terminating his\r\nparental rights to his minor child (Child). The family court found clear and\r\nconvincing evidence supported termination of parental rights (TPR) on the\r\nfollowing grounds: (1) Child has lived outside his home for a period of at least six\r\nmonths and Father has willfully failed to visit Child; (2) Child has lived outside the\r\nhome for a period of at least six months and Father has willfully failed to support\r\nChild or make a material contribution to his care; and (3) Child was in foster care\r\nfor fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months. Additionally, the family court\r\nfound TPR was in Child's best interest.\r\n\r\nFather contends the family court erred in terminating his parental rights, arguing:\r\n(1) clear and convincing evidence did not show Father willfully failed to visit\r\nChild; (2) clear and convincing evidence did not show Father failed to support\r\nChild; (3) the family court erred in concluding that proof TPR was in Child's best\r\ninterest was within the family court's discretion and did not require proof by clear\r\nand convincing evidence; (4) the family court erred in failing to make findings of\r\nfact in support of its determination TPR was in Child's best interest; and (5) the\r\nfamily court erred in refusing to grant a mistrial or continuance when Evangelica\r\nH. (Mother) disappeared between her direct examination and her cross-\r\nexamination. We affirm.\r\n\r\nOn appeal from the family court, this court reviews factual and legal issues de\r\nnovo. Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C. 412, 414, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011); see\r\nalso Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 386, 709 S.E.2d 650, 652 (2011). Although this\r\ncourt reviews the family court's findings de novo, we are not required to ignore the\r\nfact that the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position\r\nto evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their\r\ntestimony. Lewis, 392 S.C. at 385, 709 S.E.2d at 651-52. The burden is upon the\r\nappellant to convince this court that the family court erred in its findings. Id. at\r\n385, 709 S.E.2d at 652.\r\n\n\"In appeals from the family court, the appellate court has the authority to find the\r\nfacts in accordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence.\" Ex parte\r\nMorris, 367 S.C. 56, 61, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652 (2006). \"This broad scope of review\r\ndoes not, however, require the appellate court to disregard the findings of the\r\nfamily court.\" Id. \"This degree of deference is especially true in cases involving\r\nthe welfare and best interests of a minor child.\" Id. at 62, 624 S.E.2d at 652.\r\n\r\nThe family court may order TPR upon finding one or more of eleven statutory\r\ngrounds is satisfied and also finding TPR is in the best interest of the child. S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 63-7-2570 (Supp. 2011). Father failed to appeal the statutory TPR\r\nground that Child was in foster care for fifteen of the previous twenty-two months\r\nand, thus, this is the law of the case. See Morris, 367 S.C. at 65, 624 S.E.2d at\r\n653-54 (holding an unappealed ruling of the family court to be the law of the case\r\nand required affirmance). Regardless, the fifteen of twenty-two months ground is\r\nsupported by clear and convincing evidence in the record because Child was in\r\nfoster care for thirty-seven months at the time of the TPR hearing. As only one\r\nground needs to be proven to terminate parental rights, we decline to address the\r\nother statutory grounds for TPR or any alleged error by the family court. See Loe\r\nv. Mother, Father, & Berkeley Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 382 S.C. 457, 469, 675\r\nS.E.2d 807, 813 (Ct. App. 2009) (\"In South Carolina, when a child has resided in\r\nfoster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months, this ground alone is\r\nsufficient to satisfy a statutory ground for TPR.\").\r\n\r\nIn regard to the best interest issues, any purported error made by the family court\r\nregarding the standard for review or factual findings was harmless because this\r\ncourt can make its own findings from the record as to whether clear and\r\nconvincing evidence supports the termination of parental rights. See S.C. Dep't of\r\nSoc. Servs. v. Janice C., 383 S.C. 221, 226, 678 S.E.2d 463, 466 (Ct. App. 2009).\r\nWe find TPR to be in Child's best interest. Here, there is no doubt Father desires to\r\nbe part of Child's life, but the determination hinges on what is best for Child. S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 63-7-2620 (2010) (\"The interests of the child shall prevail if the\r\nchild's interest and the parental rights conflict.\"). Child is currently placed with his\r\nbrother in a non-adoptive foster home. While Child is thriving in this placement,\r\nthe Guardian ad Litem (GAL) specifically commented on the need for a father\r\nfigure and stability in Child's life. The GAL also testified TPR was in Child's best\r\ninterest. Moreover, while the DSS case worker did not make a specific statement\r\non the best interest of Child, she did explicitly recommend Father's rights be\r\nterminated. Furthermore, while there are no current pending adoptive resources for\r\nChild, both the GAL and the DSS case worker testified at least two couples had\r\n\npreviously been interested in adopting Child and his brother, but were deterred\r\nbased on the extended TPR litigation. Child has been in foster care for the vast\r\nmajority of his life and was removed before his first birthday. Accordingly, we\r\nfind the best interest of Child is served by achieving stability and permanence,\r\nwhich is best accomplished by freeing Child for potential adoption.\r\n\r\nFinally, Father contends the family court erred in denying his motions for a\r\ncontinuance or mistrial based on Mother's absence on the second day of the TPR\r\nhearing. The grant or denial of a continuance is within the discretion of the family\r\ncourt and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion. S.C.\r\nDep't of Soc. Servs. v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 52, 413 S.E.2d 835, 838 (1992). The\r\nrules of civil procedure allow that a court may grant a continuance \"[i]f good and\r\nsufficient cause . . . is shown.\" Rule 40(i)(1), SCRCP. The Fourteenth\r\nAmendment guarantees a fundamental right to freedom from State interference\r\nwith a parent's relationship with his child. See Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745,\r\n753 (1982) (\"[F]reedom of personal choice in matters of family life is a\r\nfundamental liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\"). TPR\r\nclearly interferes with a fundamental liberty interest and invokes due process\r\nprotections. S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Wilson, 352 S.C. 445, 453, 574 S.E.2d\r\n730, 734 (2002). \"Where important decisions turn on questions of fact, due\r\nprocess requires an opportunity to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses.\"\r\nBrown v. S.C. State Bd. of Educ., 301 S.C. 326, 329, 391 S.E.2d 866, 867 (1990);\r\nsee S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Holden, 319 S.C. 72, 78, 459 S.E.2d 846, 849\r\n(1995) (stating the right to confrontation has been applied in civil context). Due\r\nprocess is not violated where a party is not given the opportunity to confront\r\nwitnesses so long as there has been a meaningful opportunity to be heard. Holden,\r\n319 S.C. at 78, 459 S.E.2d at 80-81.\r\n\r\nFather moved for a continuance or a mistrial based on Mother's absence, arguing\r\nshe was a necessary witness who he expected to testify that Father was a good and\r\nsupportive parent. Even if Mother testified as Father posits, this is essentially the\r\nsame testimony Father offered in his deposition. Moreover, Mother did not testify\r\nagainst Father and instead only testified in her own defense. Father received a\r\nmeaningful opportunity to be heard on these issues, and his due process rights were\r\nnot violated by his inability to cross-examine Mother. Accordingly, the ruling of\r\nthe family court is affirmed.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.1\r\n1   We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\nFEW, C.J., and WILLIAMS and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-534","title":"State v.

Hannah appeals the ruling of the Appellate Panel of\r\nthe South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission (the Appellate Panel)\r\ndenying compensation for a low back/lumbar spine injury, arguing (1) the\r\nAppellate Panel's finding that his lumbar spine injury is not causally related to the\r\nadmitted accident is not supported by substantial evidence, (2) the Appellate Panel\r\nerred in failing to consider his lumbar spine injury in combination with his other\r\ncompensable injuries resulting from the work related accident, or alternatively to\r\nconsider whether the accident aggravated a pre-existing spinal condition as\r\nrequired by Bartley v. Allendale County School District, 392 S.C. 300, 709 S.E.2d\r\n619 (2011), (3) the Appellate Panel's rulings that he has received all proper\r\nmedical care that will tend to lessen his period of disability and is not entitled to\r\nmedical treatment or other benefits for his lumbar spine injury are not supported by\r\nsubstantial evidence and are contrary to controlling legal precedent, and (4) the\r\nAppellate Panel's reliance on Respondent's interpretation of evidence\r\nimpermissibly sanctions employer/insurer \"doctor shopping,\" which was\r\ncondemned in Risinger v. Knight Textiles, 353 S.C. 69, 577 S.E.2d 222 (Ct. App.\r\n2002). We affirm1 pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities:\r\n\r\n1.
