Thomas Wyche and David L.\r\n        Freeman, of Greenville, for Appellants.\r\n        Brian Keith James, of\r\n        Easley, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Charles and Carol\r\nMarsh appeal the trial courtâ€™s order requiring them to remove a garage from\r\ntheir property because it violates their subdivisionâ€™s restrictive\r\ncovenants.&nbsp; We affirm.[1]&nbsp;\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Marshes and Paul and Vera Hill\r\nown adjacent properties in a four-lot subdivision located on Lake Keowee in\r\nPickens County.&nbsp; The Hills use their house in the subdivision as a\r\nsecondary residence.&nbsp; The Marshes live year-round in their house in the\r\nsubdivision.&nbsp; The deeds for every lot in the subdivision contain identical\r\nrestrictive covenants.&nbsp; The restrictions include a clause stating:&nbsp;\r\nâ€œNo trailer, tent, shack, barn, temporary building, out building, shanty or\r\nmobile home of any description shall be placed or erected on said lot of land.â€\r\nIn 1988, the Marshes approached the\r\nHills and asked for permission to build a tool shed on their property.&nbsp; The\r\nHills initially objected to the tool shed because they believed it constituted\r\nan â€œout buildingâ€ in violation of the restrictive covenants.&nbsp; However,\r\nthe Hills eventually agreed to allow the Marshes to build the tool shed when the\r\nMarshes promised not to build any more outbuildings.&nbsp; Subsequently, in\r\n1992, the Marshes built a carport on their lot.&nbsp; The carport was\r\nconstructed while the Hills were away from their lake home.&nbsp; The Marshes\r\nneither informed the Hills of their intention to erect the carport nor sought\r\npermission to do so.&nbsp; In 1996, the Marshes built a two-car garage on their\r\nlot.&nbsp; The garage was also constructed during a time when the Hills were\r\naway from their lake home. &nbsp;\r\nOn March 7, 2001, the Hills returned\r\nto their lake home after being away for an extended period of time.&nbsp; They\r\nnoticed that the carport had been dismantled and moved away.&nbsp; A neighbor\r\ninformed the Hills that the Marshes were planning to build a new three or\r\nfour-car garage in its place.&nbsp; The next day the Hills sought the advice of\r\na local attorney.&nbsp; On the attorneyâ€™s advice, the Hills wrote a letter to\r\nthe Marshes expressing their opposition to a new garage being constructed where\r\nthe carport had been located. &nbsp;On April 19, 2001, the Hills noticed\r\nblocks going up around the perimeter of space where the proposed building was to\r\nhave been constructed.&nbsp; The Marshesâ€™ attorney assured the Hillsâ€™\r\nattorney that the blocks were only going to be used as a retaining wall for a\r\nparking area.&nbsp; However, on June 7, 2001, the Hillsâ€™ attorney received a\r\nletter from the Marshesâ€™ attorney stating the Marshes had decided to build a\r\nnew garage and that they were going to connect it to their house by means of a\r\nwooden walkway and bridge.&nbsp; When the Hills returned to their house on June\r\n22, 2001, most of the construction of the new garage had been completed.&nbsp;\r\nThe new garage is 1,231 square feet and currently houses four cars and a\r\nboat.&nbsp;\r\nThe Hills filed this action on\r\nAugust 20, 2001, seeking removal of the new garage from the Marshesâ€™ lot.[2]&nbsp; After a hearing, the trial\r\ncourt sent a letter to both partiesâ€™ trial counsel outlining its ruling.&nbsp;\r\nThe ruling stated that the new garage was in violation of the restrictive\r\ncovenants and required the Marshes to remove the garage from their\r\nproperty.&nbsp; Prior to the proposed order being submitted by the Hillsâ€™\r\nattorney, the Marshes discharged their trial counsel and retained a new\r\nattorney.&nbsp;\r\nBefore the final order was entered,\r\nthe Marshesâ€™ new attorney filed a motion for judgment and, alternatively, a\r\nmotion to supplement the record.&nbsp; The trial court denied both motions and\r\nentered a final order.&nbsp; The final order required the Marshes to remove the\r\nnew garage from their property because it violated the restrictive\r\ncovenants.&nbsp; The Marshes filed a motion for rehearing, amendment, and for\r\nstay and suspension of injunction pursuant to Rules 52, 59, and 62, SCRCP.&nbsp;\r\nThe trial court denied the motion for rehearing and amendment and stayed the\r\ninjunction during the pendency of an appeal.&nbsp; This appeal followed. &nbsp;\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action to enforce a restrictive\r\ncovenant is in equity.&nbsp; South Carolina Depâ€™t of Natural Res. v. Town\r\nof McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 622, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302 (2001).&nbsp; In\r\nan appeal from an equitable action, tried by a special referee alone, the\r\nappellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with our own view\r\nof the preponderance of the evidence.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; The court should\r\nnot, however, disregard the findings of the special referee, who was in a better\r\nposition to weigh the credibility of witnesses.&nbsp; Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher\r\nAgro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 237, 391 S.E.2d 538, 543 (1990).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Negative reciprocal\r\neasement\r\nThe Marshes argue on appeal that the\r\nHills have no legal right to enforce the\r\nrestrictive covenants against them.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  [I]t is well settled in this state\r\n  that where the owner of a tract of land subdivides it and sells the distinct\r\n  parcels thereto to separate grantees, imposing restrictions on its use\r\n  pursuant to a general plan of development or improvement, such restrictions\r\n  may be enforced by any grantee against any other grantee.\r\n\r\nBomar v. Echols, 270 S.C.\r\n676, 679, 244 S.E.2d 308, 310 (1978).&nbsp;\r\nRestrictive covenants may be created\r\nin express terms or by implication.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; â€œWhere they arise\r\nby implication, the restrictions are said to create a reciprocal negative\r\neasement.â€&nbsp; Id.\r\nOne seeking to show a reciprocal\r\nnegative easement must establish four elements:&nbsp; (1) a common grantor; (2)\r\na designation of the land or tract subject to restrictions; (3) a general plan\r\nor scheme of restriction in existence for the designated land or tract; (4) the\r\nrestrictive covenants run with the land.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; at 679-80, 244\r\nS.E.2d at 310.&nbsp; In determining whether reciprocal negative easements have\r\nbeen created, the court should look not only to the language of the deeds, but\r\nalso the circumstances surrounding the origin of covenants.&nbsp; Id. at\r\n680, 244 S.E.2d at 310.&nbsp; In order to establish a restrictive covenant by\r\nimplication, the implication must be â€œplain and unmistakableâ€.&nbsp; Bomar\r\nat 270 S.C. at 680, 244 S.E.2d at 311.&nbsp;\r\nIn Bomar, the Respondents\r\nwere seeking to enforce restrictions that were in their deeds against the\r\nAppellant, whose deed did not contain the same restrictions.&nbsp; Of the\r\nfourteen conveyances by the Vaughn family from the tract originally owned by A.\r\nH. Vaughn, only six conveyances, all originating from Grover Vaughn and made\r\nfrom 1953 to 1959, were restricted as to use by provisions in the deeds.&nbsp;\r\nNo master subdivision plat had been made nor had any member of the Vaughn family\r\nundertaken to improve or develop the land for use as a subdivision.&nbsp; In\r\naddition, no blanket or general restrictions conveying the Vaughn tract had ever\r\nbeen recorded.&nbsp; The supreme court held:&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  Without more, we are unable to\r\n  conclude that these piecemeal, lot by lot sales from a large tract of land\r\n  over a considerable time span, made without reference to a master plat,\r\n  constitute a general plan or scheme.&nbsp; The provision permitting the\r\n  restrictions to be enforced by the grantor or any purchaser of land from the\r\n  Vaughn tract can not have the effect, as contended by the respondents, of\r\n  transforming restrictions applicable to specific lots into blanket\r\n  restrictions.\r\n\r\nId.&nbsp; at 681, 244 S.E.2d\r\nat 311.&nbsp;\r\nThe Marshes assert the Hills failed\r\nto satisfy the third element of a general plan or scheme of restriction.&nbsp;\r\nWe disagree.&nbsp; Jerry Mehan, the original developer of the subdivision filed\r\na plat on April 6, 1976 showing tract subdivided into four lots.&nbsp; He sold\r\nthe first of these lots, Lot 1, to the Hillsâ€™ predecessor in interest on April\r\n2, 1976.&nbsp; He sold another lot, Lot 3, on April 4, 1973.&nbsp; He next sold\r\nthe Marshes their lot, Lot 2, on November 4, 1977.&nbsp; He sold the final lot,\r\nLot 4, on September 29, 1982.&nbsp; In each deed conveying the lots, Mehan\r\nincluded the exact same restrictions.&nbsp;\r\nUnlike the deeds in Bomar, all of\r\nthese deeds were executed relatively close in time and included the same\r\nrestrictions.&nbsp; We agree with the trial court that the reciprocal right of\r\nenforcement can be implied in the deeds.&nbsp; Accordingly, we hold the trial\r\ncourt did not err in holding the Hills had the right to enforce the restrictive\r\ncovenants.&nbsp;\r\nII.&nbsp; Waiver, estoppel, and\r\nlaches&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe Marshes next argue that the\r\nHills are barred by the doctrines of waiver, estoppel, and laches from enforcing\r\nthe covenants because the Hills acquiesced in other neighborhood violations of\r\nthe restrictive covenants.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  If there has been unreasonable\r\n  delay in asserting claims, or if, knowing his rights, a party does not\r\n  seasonably avail himself of means at hand for their enforcement, but suffers\r\n  his adversary to incur expenses or enter into obligations or otherwise change\r\n  his position, or in any way by inaction lulls suspicion of his demands to the\r\n  harm of the other, or if there has been actual or passive acquiescence in the\r\n  performance of the act complained of, then equity will ordinarily refuse her\r\n  aid for the establishment of an admitted right, especially if an injunction is\r\n  asked.\r\n\r\nRabon v. Mali, 289 S.C. 37,\r\n40, 344 S.E.2d 608, 610 (1986).\r\nâ€œWaiver is the intentional\r\nrelinquishment of a known right.â€&nbsp; Gibbs v. Kimbrell, 311 S.C.\r\n261, 267, 428 S.E.2d 725, 729 (Ct. App. 1993).&nbsp; A party is not necessarily\r\nbarred from enforcing restrictive covenants where a previous deviation of the\r\nrestrictions has been allowed.&nbsp; Rabon, 289 S.C. at 40, 344 S.E.2d at\r\n610.&nbsp; A partyâ€™s waiver of the right to object to a minor violation of a\r\ncovenant does not result in waiver of the right to object to a subsequent and\r\nmore substantial violation.&nbsp; Gibbs, 311 S.C. at 268, 428 S.E.2d at\r\n729.&nbsp;\r\nâ€œLaches is the negligent failure\r\nto act for an unreasonable period of time.â€&nbsp; Gibbs, 311 S.C. at\r\n269, 428 S.E.2d at 730.&nbsp; However, delay alone in the assertion of a right,\r\nwithout injury to the adversary, does not constitute laches.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nWhether a plaintiff is barred by laches is to be determined in light of the\r\ncircumstances in each particular case.&nbsp; Rabon, 289 S.C. at 40, 344\r\nS.E.2d at 610.\r\n\r\n  Estoppel arises when a party,\r\n  relying upon what another has said or done, changes his position to his\r\n  detriment.&nbsp; Additionally, estoppel arises when a party observes another\r\n  dealing with his property in a manner inconsistent with his rights and makes\r\n  no objection while the other changes his position in reliance on the partyâ€™s\r\n  silence; the partyâ€™s silence is acquiescence that estops him from later\r\n  seeking relief.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGibbs, 311 S.C. at 268, 428\r\nS.E.2d at 729 (citations omitted).\r\nThe Marshes rely on Rabon.&nbsp;\r\nWe find that case distinguishable from the present case.&nbsp; In Rabon,\r\nthe Malisâ€™ predecessor in title had used three of his four lots in a\r\nsubdivision for commercial purposes for years before selling the property to the\r\nMalis, despite the restrictions against such use on one of the lots, Lot\r\n50.&nbsp; The supreme court found the objecting property owners knew of the\r\nprior commercial use of the property and never expressed concern or objected to\r\nthe property being put to commercial use.&nbsp; The court also found ample\r\nevidence to support reliance by the Malis on the permissibility of a commercial\r\nenterprise on the premises.&nbsp; It noted that because of the objecting\r\nlandowners passivity with regard to the prior commercial use of the property,\r\nthe Malis had adversely changed their position by expending approximately\r\n$43,000.00 dollars on improvements to the property.&nbsp; The supreme court held\r\nthe Malis could continue using Lot 50 for commercial purposes; however the court\r\nalso held that as there was no indication Lot 51 had been used for commercial\r\npurposes in the past, the objecting property owners were not barred from\r\nenforcing the restrictive covenant on this particular lot.&nbsp;\r\nIn finding the Hills were not barred\r\nfrom enforcing the restrictive covenants, the trial court relied on Gibbs.&nbsp;\r\nIn Gibbs, the Gibbs and Kimbrells owned adjacent lots in a forty-five lot\r\nsubdivision subject to restrictive covenants.&nbsp; For over 10 years, the\r\nKimbrellsâ€™ predecessors in title, the Reids, had operated a blueberry farm on\r\ntheir lots.&nbsp; The farm was only a part-time business, which the Reids\r\noperated only on the weekends.&nbsp; Two years before the Kimbrells purchased\r\ntheir lots, the Gibbs granted the Reids permission to build a shed on the\r\nlots.&nbsp; The shed did not have a foundation or walls and was easily\r\nmovable.&nbsp; After purchasing the property, the Kimbrells informed the Gibbs\r\nthat they intended to construct a garage on their property and operate an\r\nautomobile repair business thereupon.&nbsp; After the Kimbrells poured the\r\nconcrete floor, the Gibbs brought an action to enjoin the Kimbrells from\r\noperating a car repair business on their property because it violated the\r\nsubdivisionâ€™s restrictive covenants.&nbsp; Although the court had prohibited\r\nthe erection of any buildings on the property during the pendency of the action,\r\nthe Kimbrells proceeded to add walls, a door, and a window to the shed.&nbsp;\r\nThe trial court ordered the Kimbrells to remove the garage from their\r\nproperty.&nbsp;\r\nOn appeal, this court rejected the\r\nKimbrellsâ€™ assertion that the Gibbs were barred by waiver, laches or estoppel\r\nfrom enforcing the restrictive covenants.&nbsp; The court held that although the\r\nGibbs may have intended to waive their objections to the operation of a\r\nblueberry farm or similar activity, they had not waived their right to object to\r\na significantly different activity.&nbsp;\r\nThis court also similarly rejected\r\nthe Kimbrellsâ€™ estoppel arguments.&nbsp; It held that there was no evidence\r\nthat the Kimbrells had changed their position in reliance on any actions by the\r\nGibbs.&nbsp; As to the Kimbrellsâ€™ argument that the Gibbs were estopped from\r\nenforcing the covenants because the Gibbs permitted multiple violations by other\r\nsubdivision residents, this court noted that in filing their action against the\r\nKimbrells, the Gibbs had objected to the only violations of which they were\r\naware.&nbsp; The court further held:&nbsp; â€œRegardless, the violation of\r\ncovenants by other residents of the subdivision without objection by the Gibbsâ€™\r\nwould not affect their right to enforce the covenants against the Kimbrells\r\nunless the character of the subdivision has changed so radically as to defeat\r\nthe purpose of the covenants.â€&nbsp; Gibbs, 311 S.C. at 268-69, 428\r\nS.E.2d at 730.&nbsp; Therefore, a plaintiff can enforce restrictive covenants\r\nagainst a defendant whether or not the plaintiff has enforced those covenants\r\nagainst other residents in a subdivision.\r\nFinally, the court held the Gibbs\r\nwere not barred by laches in that they had acted with reasonable diligence in\r\ninitiating their action within five months of learning of the Kimbrellsâ€™\r\nplans.&nbsp; The court further ruled: â€œRegardless, a party â€˜[who] openly\r\ndefies known rights, in the absence of anything to mislead him . . . is not in a\r\nposition to urge as a bar [his adversaryâ€™s] failure to take the most instant\r\nconceivable resort to the courts.â€™â€ Id. at 269, 428 S.E.2d at 730 (quoting Archambault\r\nv. Sprouse, 218 S.C. 500, 509, 63 S.E.2d 459, 463 (1951)).&nbsp;\r\nIn arguing the Hills are barred by\r\nestoppel, waiver, and laches, the Marshes assert other lots in their subdivision\r\ncontain restrictive covenant violations.&nbsp; Lot three in the subdivision is\r\nvacant.&nbsp; However, lot four in the subdivision contains a house, a\r\nboathouse, a tool shed, and a garage. &nbsp;The Marshesâ€™ lot includes a\r\nresidence, a small garage, a tool shed, and the garage that is the subject of\r\nthis lawsuit and replaced a carport.&nbsp; The Hills have a boathouse on their\r\nlot.\r\nDr. Hill testified that he and his\r\nwife did not object to the two outbuildings on Lot 4 because the buildings can\r\nbarely be seen and have not changed the character of the neighborhood.&nbsp; He\r\nasserted that he had not even noticed one of the outbuildings because it looked\r\nlike a part of the house.&nbsp; He stated his boathouse was on the lake owned by\r\nDuke Power and not on the lot; thus it was not subject to the\r\nrestrictions.&nbsp; As stated above, the Marshes sought and received the Hillsâ€™\r\npermission before constructing the tool shed, promising the Hills they would not\r\nviolate the covenants again.&nbsp; The Marshes erected the subsequent buildings\r\nwhen the Hills were away.&nbsp; Dr. Hill testified that he did not voice his\r\nobjections with the other buildings because he did not want to sue a neighbor\r\nover what he considered minor violations when the buildings had already been\r\ncompleted.&nbsp; However, he claimed the large garage, which is on the other\r\nside of the road from the Marshesâ€™ house, had changed the character of the\r\nneighborhood.&nbsp;\r\nWe agree with the trial court\r\nfinding the holding in Gibbs to be controlling in the case at hand.&nbsp;\r\nAs a result, even if the Hills did acquiesce in other minor subdivision\r\nviolations, they did not waive their right to require the Marshes to remove the\r\ngarage, which is a major violation and different from the other\r\nviolations.&nbsp;\r\nThe Marshesâ€™ defense of estoppel\r\nfails as they cannot establish that they changed their position to their\r\ndetriment based on the Hillsâ€™ actions.&nbsp; Their defense of laches fails for\r\nthe same reason.&nbsp; The Hills objected to the construction of the garage as\r\nsoon as they learned of the Marshesâ€™ plans.&nbsp; Although the Marshes\r\ncompleted the garage at a cost of $40,000, they did so knowing of the Hillsâ€™\r\nobjections.&nbsp;\r\nFinally, we find misplaced the\r\nMarshesâ€™ reliance on Honnicutt v. Rickenbacker, 268 S.C. 511, 234\r\nS.E.2d 887 (1977).&nbsp; In Honnicutt, the supreme court held:\r\n\r\n  The issuance of a mandatory\r\n  injunction depends upon the equities between the parties, and it rests in the\r\n  sound judicial discretion of the court whether such an injunction should be\r\n  granted.&nbsp; Where a great injury will be done to the defendant, with very\r\n  little if any to the plaintiff, the courts will deny equitable relief.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nId.&nbsp; at 515-16, 234\r\nS.E.2d at 889.&nbsp; The court reversed a portion of an order that granted a\r\nmandatory injunction requiring the removal of a commercial building erected in\r\nviolation of restrictive covenants.&nbsp; Instead, it allowed the appellants the\r\nopportunity to convert the building to residential use to be in compliance with\r\nthe restrictions.&nbsp;\r\nThe Marshes argue:&nbsp; â€œIt would\r\nbe a shame under the circumstances to order the Marshes to destroy the building\r\nwhich cost a great deal to erect and will cost a great deal to tear down.â€&nbsp;\r\nThe Marshes rely on equitable principles to protect them when they constructed\r\ntheir garage with full knowledge that the garage was in violation of the\r\ncovenants and that the Hills objected to its construction.&nbsp; Two of the\r\nlong-standing equitable maxims are â€œNo person shall be allowed to reap the\r\nbenefits arising from his own wrongful acts,â€ and&nbsp; â€œHe who seeks equity\r\nmust do equity.â€&nbsp; Taff v. Smith, 114 S.C. 306, 312, 103 S.E. 551,\r\n553 (1920).&nbsp; We find the Marshes constructed the garage at their own\r\nrisk.&nbsp; They cannot&nbsp; rely on equity to allow them to keep the product\r\nof their own wrongful acts.&nbsp;\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated above, the\r\norder of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ.,\r\nconcur.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[1]We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215,\r\nSCACR.\r\n[2] The Hillsâ€™ original attorney was unable, due to time\r\nconstraints, to file suit on behalf of the Hills.&nbsp; However, he referred the\r\nHills to their current attorney, who filed this suit.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-002","title":"Lowe v.

App. 2002) (stating that property acquired \r\n  by either party prior to the marriage can be transmuted into marital property \r\n  if, among other things, â€œit is utilized by the parties in support of the marriage \r\n  or in some other manner so as to evidence an intent by the parties to make it \r\n  marital property.â€); Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 100, 545 S.E.2d \r\n  531, 537 (Ct. App. 2001) (explaining that the appellate court looks at the fairness \r\n  of the overall equitable distribution, and if the end result is equitable, it \r\n  will affirm).\r\n2.Â  The issues of whether the family court erred (1) \r\n  in failing to â€œinclude, value, and equitably divide marital personal property \r\n  and debt of the partiesâ€ and (2) â€œby holding that the passive increase in the \r\n  value of [Wifeâ€™s] retirement account after this action was commenced was a non-marital \r\n  assetâ€ are not preserved for review: Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. \r\n  71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be \r\n  raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled \r\n  upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).\r\n3.Â  The family court did not err by including Husbandâ€™s \r\n  retirement account in the marital estate: Hickum v. Hickum, 320 S.C. \r\n  97, 100, 463 S.E.2d 321, 322-323 (Ct. App. 1995) (reaffirming the proposition \r\n  that retirement plans are includable as marital property subject to division). \r\n\r\n4.Â  The family court did not commit reversible \r\n  error by awarding Wife fifty percent of the marital estate:Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 20-7-472 (vesting the family court with the discretion to decide which weight \r\n  should be assigned to the various factors of equitable apportionment); Jenkins, \r\n  345 S.C. at 100, 545 S.E.2d at 537 (â€œThis court will affirm the family court \r\n  judge if it can be determine that the judge addressed the factors under section \r\n  20-7-472 sufficiently for us to conclude he was cognizant of the statutory factors.â€). \r\n\r\n5.Â  The family court did not err in determining \r\n  the amount of alimony awarded to Husband: S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130 (Supp. 2003) \r\n  (vesting the family court with the discretion to decide which weight should \r\n  be assigned to the various factors that should be considered when awarding alimony); \r\n  Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 186, 554 S.E.2d 421, 425 (Ct. App. 2001) \r\n  (â€œOur inquiry on appeal is not whether the family court gave the same weight \r\n  to particular factors [used to determine alimony] as this court would have; \r\n  rather, our inquiry extends only to whether the family court abused its considerable \r\n  discretion in assigning weight to the applicable factors.â€); Bryson v. Bryson, \r\n  347 S.C. 221, 224, 553 S.E.2d 493, 495 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œQuestions concerning \r\n  alimony rest with the sound discretion of the family court.Â  An abuse of discretion \r\n  occurs when the decision is controlled by some error of law or is based on findings \r\n  of fact that are without evidentiary support.â€).\r\n6.Â  The family court did not err when \r\n  it denied Husbandâ€™s request for attorneyâ€™s fees: Donahue v. Donahue, \r\n  299 S.C. 353, 365, 384 S.E.2d 741, 748 (1989) (â€œAn award of attorneysâ€™ fees \r\n  and costs is a discretionary matter not to be overturned absent abuse by the \r\n  trial court.â€); Griffith v. Griffith, 332 S.C. 630, 645, 506 S.E.2d 526, \r\n  534 (Ct. App. 1998) (explaining that, when determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees, the family court should consider (1) each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or \r\n  her own fee, (2) the beneficial results obtained by the attorney, (3) the partiesâ€™ \r\n  respective financial conditions, and (4) the effect of the attorneyâ€™s fee on \r\n  each partyâ€™s standard of living).Â  See Messer v. Messer, 359 S.C. \r\n  614, 633, 598 S.E.2d 310, 320 (Ct. App. 2004) (refusing to find an abuse of \r\n  discretion as to the award of attorneyâ€™s fees when the family court analyzed \r\n  each of the factors, detailed its findings in its final order, and those findings \r\n  were supported by affidavits).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-003","title":"State v.

Cottingham, Circuit Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-003\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2005 â€“ Filed January \r\n  7, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Eleanor Duffy Cleary, of Columbia, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, \r\n  and Senior Asst. Atty. General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; and Solicitor \r\n  Robert Douglas Robbins, of Summerville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Don Lewis Hughes (Hughes) appeals \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s refusal to grant him a new trial.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nHughes was convicted of two counts \r\n  of criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the second degree.Â  At trial, Crystal \r\n  Tuck (Tuck), a child sexual abuse counselor who had counseled the victims, testified \r\n  for the State.Â  During cross-examination, Tuck acknowledged that prior to testifying, \r\n  she had reviewed her office notes to refresh her memory.Â  Defense counsel sought \r\n  to inspect the notes, but Tuck did not have them with her.Â  Further, because \r\n  the notes were in Columbia and the trial was in Orangeburg, the trial court \r\n  refused to require Tuck to submit them.Â Â  \r\nOn appeal, this Court reversed, finding â€œthe trial \r\n  court erred in failing to exercise its discretionâ€ under Rule 612, SCRE.Â  State \r\n  v. Hughes, 346 S.C. 339, 552 S.E.2d 35 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  We held that under \r\n  the plain language of Rule 612, SCRE, â€œthe trial court has discretion to allow \r\n  or refuse examination by an adverse party of writings used by a witness prior \r\n  to trial to refresh his or her memory.â€Â  Hughes, 346 S.C. at 342, 552 \r\n  S.E.2d at 36.Â  Moreover, we stated, â€œâ€˜When a trial judge is vested with discretion, \r\n  but his ruling reveals no discretion was, in fact exercised, an error of law \r\n  has occurred.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting Fontaine v. Peitz, 291 S.C. 536, \r\n  538-39, 354 S.E.2d 565, 566-57 (1987).Â  \r\nAccordingly, we reversed â€œthe trial courtâ€™s \r\n  refusal to order Tuck to submit her notes and remand[ed] for an evidentiary \r\n  hearing to determine whether Hughes was entitled to access to the notes as outlined \r\n  in Rule 612.â€Â  We instructed:Â  â€œIf the trial court finds production of the notes \r\n  was necessary in the interests of justice, and the denial of such access significantly \r\n  impaired Hughesâ€™s defense, it shall grant a new trial.â€Â  Hughes, 246 \r\n  S.C. at 343-44, 552 S.E.2d at 37.\r\n\r\nOn remand, the trial court stated:\r\nThe Court has reviewed the prior testimony and the notes \r\n  of Crystal Tuck in detail.Â  As part of this hearing, Ms. Tuck was thoroughly \r\n  examined by counsel for the State and Defense.Â Â  After careful consideration \r\n  of the above information, this Court concludes that there is nothing in the \r\n  notes of Ms. Tuck that would have assisted counsel in the defense of Mr. Hughes.\r\nThe Court does not find in the interest of justice, that \r\n  this case should be remanded because there is simply nothing in these records \r\n  that would assist defense counsel in her defense of Mr. Hughes.Â  The notes were \r\n  consistent with the testimony of Ms. Tuck and nothing in the notes impaired \r\n  or impeached the testimony of Shelly or Donna Hughes.Â  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGenerally, the grant or refusal of a new \r\n  trial is within the trial courtâ€™s discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal \r\n  without a clear abuse of that discretion.Â  State v. Smith, 316 S.C. 53, \r\n  447 S.E.2d 175 (1993).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when a trial courtâ€™s \r\n  decision is unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Garrett, 350 S.C. 613, 619, 567 S.E.2d 523, 526 (Ct. App. 2002). \r\n\r\nPursuant to this Courtâ€™s \r\n  opinion, the trial courtâ€™s function was to determine whether the production \r\n  of Tuckâ€™s notes was necessary in the interests of justice, such that denial \r\n  of access to the notes significantly impaired Hughesâ€™s defense.Â  Rule 612, SCRE \r\n  provides:\r\n\r\nIf a witness uses a writing to \r\n  refresh memory for the purpose of testifying, eitherâ€”\r\n  \r\n(1) while testifying, \r\n  or\r\n(2) before testifying, if the \r\n  court in its discretion determines it is necessary in the interests of justice, \r\n  an adverse party is entitled to have the writing produced at the hearing, to \r\n  inspect it, to cross-examine the witness thereon, and to introduce in evidence \r\n  those portions which relate to the testimony of the witness.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\nIn a footnote, the Hughes \r\n  court observed that other courts had looked at the following factors to determine \r\n  the interest of the party seeking production: (1) the importance of the witnessâ€™s \r\n  testimony; (2) the extent of the witnessâ€™s reliance on the notes; (3) the extent \r\n  to which the writings might reveal a credibility problem; (4) whether credibility \r\n  could be challenged some other way; and (5) whether there is evidence of a plan \r\n  to use writings to influence the witnessâ€™s testimony and then resist production.Â  \r\n  Hughes, 346 S.C. at 343-44 n.4, 552 S.E.2d at 37 n.4.\r\nHughes admits in his \r\n  brief that the notes were â€œsparse forms that provided little substantive information \r\n  about Tuckâ€™s sessions with the children.â€Â  Looking to the factors noted, we \r\n  find Hughesâ€™s interest in accessing Tuckâ€™s notes was minimal.Â  There simply \r\n  is little in the notes from which Tuck could have relied in giving her testimony.Â  \r\n  As for credibility, the following exchange occurred at the remand hearing:\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      [The\r\n        Court]:&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  Tell me where these notes reflect any issue as to her credibility.Â  I donâ€™t \r\n  see it.Â  Iâ€™ve read her testimony, Iâ€™ve seen the notes.Â  Where does she deviate \r\n  in any respect from these notes?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       [Counsel]:\r\n      &nbsp;. . . .\r\n        \r\n        . . . If youâ€™re trying to point \r\n  me to a specific line in there, Iâ€™m not going to be able to give you an answer.Â \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nMoreover, Hughes was able to \r\n  otherwise test Tuckâ€™s credibility.Â  Hughes elicited that the victims were the \r\n  only persons with direct personal knowledge of the abuse, and that Tuckâ€™s expert \r\n  diagnosis was only as good as the victimsâ€™ statements to Tuck.Â  Finally, there \r\n  exists no evidence or allegation of a plan to use the notes to influence Tuckâ€™s \r\n  testimony and then resist production.Â  The trial court found, and we agree, \r\n  that â€œthere is nothing in the notes of Ms. Tuck that would have assisted counsel \r\n  in the defense of Mr. Hughes.â€Â  \r\nThe Hughes court \r\n  gave further guidance on the factors other courts have employed to analyze the \r\n  burden of production: (1) the extent of the materials sought; (2) whether such \r\n  materials are privileged or attorney work product; (3) public policy; (4) conduct \r\n  of the party seeking production; and (5) whether production would unduly delay \r\n  the proceedings.Â  Hughes, 346 S.C. at 343-44 n.4, 552 S.E.2d at 37 n.4.\r\nProduction of Tuckâ€™s \r\n  notes would have delayed trial because the notes were in Columbia and the trial \r\n  was in Orangeburg.Â  However, the burden on the State of producing these notes \r\n  at some time during the trial was not great.Â  Nonetheless, the question of whether \r\n  Hughes should be granted a new trial must be answered by considering all of \r\n  these factors and by asking whether the denial of access to the notes significantly \r\n  impaired Hughesâ€™s defense.Â  Considering all of the factors, we find that Tuckâ€™s \r\n  notes would not have proved significant to Hughesâ€™s defense.Â  Therefore, we \r\n  hold that failure to require production of the notes did not significantly impair \r\n  Hughesâ€™s defense, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying \r\n  him a new trial.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause the benefits of the notes \r\n  to Hughes are negligible, the trial court did not err in denying Hughes a new \r\n  trial.Â  The court properly exercised discretion under Rule 612, SCRE, and its \r\n  ruling is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n ANDERSON, STILWELL, \r\n  and SHORT, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-004","title":"State v.

Brooker, Jr., of Columbia; and John Robert Devlin, \r\n  Jr., of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nH. W. Paschal, Jr., of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The South Carolina \r\n  Department of Transportation (SCDOT) appeals a jury award in favor of landowners, \r\n  Jimmy and Pete Mantekas, on their cause of action for inverse condemnation.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nJimmy and Pete Mantekas own commercial \r\n  property in Greenville fronting Old Easley Bridge Road, which came to a dead \r\n  end just west of their property.Â  Had Old Easley Bridge Road not ended, it would \r\n  have intersected U.S. 123 at an angle.Â  Just east of the dead end and across \r\n  from the Mantekas property, motorists created a â€œcut-through,â€ providing access \r\n  between U.S. 123 and Old Easley Bridge Road.Â  At some time prior to 1971, this \r\n  cut-through was paved and a stop sign erected.Â  Importantly, SCDOT denies the \r\n  cut-through is a state maintained road.Â  \r\nDOT constructed a chain link fence, curb, and grassy area \r\n  permanently blocking the cut-through and all other access between U.S. 123 and \r\n  Old Easley Bridge Road as part of a highway project designed to create a new \r\n  entrance ramp onto U.S. 123.Â  The Mantekases sued SCDOT under a theory of inverse \r\n  condemnation for impact the loss of access had on their property value.Â  \r\nThe trial court discussed presenting a special \r\n  verdict form to the jury, stating: \r\n\r\nI think that if they find as a fact in this case that [the \r\n  cut-through] was an extension of Old Easley Bridge Road, the I am going to rule \r\n  as a matter of fact that the property abuts under the Cothran case, and \r\n  if it were [sic] closed and they had â€“ if itâ€™s a cul-de-sac, then they need \r\n  to determine damages.\r\n\r\nThe special verdict form was presented \r\n  to the jury without objection and read as follows:\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n       1.\r\n      \r\n  \r\n  Do you find the [cut-through] was an extension of Old Easley Bridge Road?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n      Yes\r\n       \r\n  If yes, GO TO QUESTION 2.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n      \r\n        No\r\n      \r\n If \r\n  no, STOP AND DO NOT&nbsp;\r\nDELIBERATE FURTHER.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n       2.&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  Find $ ____________ just compensation for the taking of property.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nAs a result of the special verdict \r\n  form, the jury implicitly determined liability, i.e. whether a taking had occurred, \r\n  by answering the first question in the affirmative.Â  The jury further determined \r\n  $55,001 to be just compensation.Â  SCDOT appeals.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the trial court erred in submitting the question of a taking to the \r\n  jury?\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the trial court erred in finding the Mantekas property abutted the cut-through \r\n  section of Old Easley Bridge Road?\r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the trial court erred in failing to find special injury?\r\n  IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether there was any basis in fact to determine the Mantekases suffered special \r\n  injury?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSCDOT argues the court erred in submitting \r\n  the question of a taking to the jury.Â  Specifically, SCDOT argues the existence \r\n  of a taking is an equitable matter that must be tried before the court alone \r\n  whereas the amount of just compensation is a legal matter to be determined by \r\n  a jury.Â  We find this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  \r\nThe trial court, citing City \r\n  of Rock Hill v. Cothran, 209 S.C. 357, 40 S.E.2d 239 (1946) [1] , determined that if the jury \r\n  found the cut-through was an extension of Old Easley Bridge Road, then the Mantekas \r\n  property abutted Old Easley Bridge Road, and the Mantekases had suffered special \r\n  injury entitling them to just compensation.Â  The jury then determined by means \r\n  of the special verdict form, that the cut-through was an extension of Old Easley \r\n  Bridge Road and the Mantekases were entitled to $51,000.Â Â  SCDOT made no objection \r\n  to the submission of the special verdict form, in fact SCDOT specifically requested \r\n  the special verdict form in the manner submitted by the trial judge to the jury.Â  \r\n  Therefore, we find the issue of whether the trial court erred in submitting \r\n  â€œany question going to the existence of a taking to the juryâ€ not preserved \r\n  for our review.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 \r\n  S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for \r\n  the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the \r\n  trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€); Horn v. Davis Elec. \r\n  Constructors, Inc., 302 S.C. 484, 487, 395 S.E.2d 724, 725-26 (Ct. App. \r\n  1990) (finding that parties to an equitable action may consent to submit issues \r\n  of fact to the jury).Â  \r\nMoreover, we find SCDOTâ€™s following \r\n  two issues on appeal not preserved for review.Â  SCDOT asserts the trial court \r\n  erred (1) in finding the Mantekas property abutted Old Easley Bridge Road because \r\n  his statement on the law and special verdict form reflected a misreading of \r\n  relevant case law, and (2) the trial court erred in failing to find special \r\n  injury.Â  Both of these issues could have been raised to and ruled upon by the \r\n  trial judge at the time he discussed presenting a special verdict form to the \r\n  jury.Â  However, instead of objecting to the special verdict form, SCDOT consented \r\n  to it and specifically requested the form in the manner presented to the jury.Â  \r\n  Therefore, we decline to address these issues.Â  See Wilder Corp., \r\n  330 S.C. at 76, 497 S.E.2d at 733; Horn, 302 S.C. at 487, 395 S.E.2d \r\n  at 725-26.Â  \r\nSCDOT also argues the trial \r\n  court erred in charging the jury on special injury.Â  However, while SCDOT objected \r\n  to the form of the charge initially, the trial judge made corrections to his \r\n  charge and SCDOTâ€™s counsel responded, â€œI have no further exception on the charge.â€Â  \r\n  Thus, this issue is similarly not preserved for our review.Â  See Murray \r\n  v. Bank of America, N.A., 354 S.C. 337, 346, 580 S.E.2d 194, 199 (Ct. App. \r\n  2003) (â€œIt is certainly true that an appellant who failed to object to a jury \r\n  charge at the first opportunity cannot complain about the charge on appeal.â€). \r\n\r\nLastly, SCDOT argues there is \r\n  no basis in fact to determine the Mantekases suffered special injury. \r\n  [2] Â  We disagree.\r\nJudy Gilstrap, a real estate \r\n  broker, testified the neighborhood is partially residential and the closing \r\n  of the street would actually benefit residential property owners, but harm commercial \r\n  property owners by limiting the amount of traffic approaching the businesses.Â  \r\n  Likewise, SCDOTâ€™s expert witness testified the Mantekases had a corner lot prior \r\n  to the street closing and they now have what was effectively an interior lot.Â  \r\n  He further testified corner lots offer greater visibility and access and carry \r\n  a greater value in the market place.Â  Finally, he calculated the loss of value \r\n  as $55,000.Â  This testimony specifically provides evidence of the Mantekasesâ€™ \r\n  special injury, which is different in kind and not merely degree from that suffered \r\n  by the public at large.Â  See generally Gray v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Highways \r\n  and Public Transp., 311 S.C. 144, 152, 427 S.E.2d 899, 903-04 (Ct. App. \r\n  1992) (â€œThe critical question was whether the closing of the intersection affected \r\n  the value of Grayâ€™s property in some special way not common to other property \r\n  in the area. The evidence showed Grayâ€™s property abuts on the intersection that \r\n  was closed . . . .Â  Grayâ€™s property was peculiarly suited for this use because \r\n  of its location at the intersection. Thus, there was evidence from which the \r\n  jury could find that he was specially damaged . . . .â€).\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  In Cothran, the City closed a portion of Laurel Street.Â  \r\n    Landowners owned property abutting Laurel Street, but not fronting the portion \r\n    of the street closed by the City.Â  The Landowners sued alleging the vacation \r\n    of the street, which formally afforded them a â€œgreat tide of traffic and travel,â€ \r\n    amounted to a taking entitling them to just compensation.Â  209 S.C. at 370, \r\n    40 S.E.2d at 243.Â  The judgment was in favor of the city and the Landowners \r\n    appealed.Â  The supreme court determined that â€œ[i]f it appears that there is \r\n    a special injury, the owner may recover damages notwithstanding his property \r\n    does not abut, as in this case, on the part of the street vacated, because \r\n    this amounts to a â€˜takingâ€™.â€Â  Id. at 368, 40 S.E.2d at 243 (citation \r\n    omitted).Â  \r\n  The court determined there was special injury for the Landowners because â€œwhat \r\n    was originally an open thoroughfare along the entire line of [Landownersâ€™] \r\n    property fronting Laurel Street, was by action of the City Council turned \r\n    into a cul de sac.â€Â  Id. at 370, 40 S.E.2d at 244.Â  The court further \r\n    determined special injury occurred because neither the other property on the \r\n    block nor the property of the general public was similarly affected.Â  Id.Â  \r\n    Therefore, the Cothran court found the actions of the City amounted \r\n    to a taking of Landownerâ€™s land, entitling them to just compensation.Â  Id.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  SCDOT assumes for purposes of this argument only that the scope of \r\n    review is the any evidence standard applicable to factual determinations made \r\n    by a jury.Â  See Horn, 302 S.C. at 487, 395 S.E.2d at 726 (reviewing \r\n    the factual findings of the jury in an equitable action to determine if there \r\n    was any evidence to support the findings). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-009","title":"Merritt v.

Anderson, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No.Â  2005-UP-009\r\nHeard November 16, 2004 â€“ Filed January \r\n  10, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART,\r\nand REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\nJeffrey Falkner Wilkes, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nJames C. Cothran, Jr., of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\nJoseph K. Maddox, Jr., of Spartanburg, for Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this appeal arising from \r\n  a divorce decree, George Todd Merritt (Husband) argues the family court erred \r\n  in identifying and dividing the marital property, granting custody of the partiesâ€™ \r\n  child to Frances Deborah Merritt (Wife), requiring Husband to pay half of the \r\n  childâ€™s private school tuition, and awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife.Â  We affirm \r\n  in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nFrances and George Merritt were married in March \r\n  1992. Â During the marriage, the parties accumulated very little personal property \r\n  because Husband came into the marriage with household goods he had retained \r\n  from a prior marriage. In July 1993, the couple had a child.Â  Two years later, \r\n  the couple built a house with the assistance of Husbandâ€™s family.Â Â Â  In June \r\n  2000, after eight years of marriage, Wife learned that Husband was committing \r\n  adultery.Â  Soon thereafter, she initiated divorce proceedings.Â  In 2001, a divorce \r\n  was granted on the ground of adultery. Pursuant to the partiesâ€™ divorce, the \r\n  family court identified and divided marital property, granted primary custody \r\n  of the child to Wife, required Husband to pay half of the childâ€™s private school \r\n  tuition, and granted Wife attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OR REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has \r\n  authority to find the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.Â  Wynn v. Wynn, 360 S.C. 117, 122, 600 S.E.2d 71, 74&nbsp;(Ct. \r\n  App. 2004).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard \r\n  the findings of the family court.Â  Greene v. Greene, 351 S.C. 329, 335, \r\n  569 S.E.2d 393, 397 (Ct. App. 2002). We are mindful that the family court judge, \r\n  who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their \r\n  credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Roberson v. \r\n  Roberson, 359 S.C. 384, 388, 597 S.E.2d 840, 842&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\n  â€œThis is especially true in cases involving the welfare and best interests of \r\n  children.â€Â  Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. \r\n  445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996).\r\nThe family court has broad discretion in determining \r\n  how marital property is to be valued and distributed.Â  Murphy v. Murphy, \r\n  319 S.C. 324, 329, 461 S.E.2d 39, 41 (1995).Â  Therefore, the family court may \r\n  use any reasonable means to divide the property equitably, and its judgment \r\n  will only be disturbed where abuse of discretion is found.Â  Id. at 329, \r\n  461 S.E.2d at 41-42.\r\n\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHusband argues that premarital personal property and \r\n  a workersâ€™ compensation award were improperly transmuted and apportioned.Â  Next, \r\n  he argues the marital residence was improperly apportioned.Â  Husband also argues \r\n  that the courtâ€™s child custody arrangement was in error and that he should not \r\n  be required to pay private school tuition for his child.Â  Finally, he argues \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees should not have been awarded to Wife.\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transmutation of Personal Premarital \r\n  Property  \r\nHusband argues personal premarital property was improperly \r\n  transmuted because the family court â€œfailed to find any specific facts which \r\n  would indicate an intent that [the premarital property] become marital other \r\n  than their mere use during the marriage.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nMarital property is defined as â€œall real and personal \r\n  property which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which \r\n  is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation . . \r\n  . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2003).Â  However, property acquired by \r\n  either party prior to the marriage can be transmuted into marital property if: \r\n  â€œ(1) it becomes so commingled with marital property as to be untraceable; (2) \r\n  it is jointly titled; or (3) it is utilized by the parties in support of the \r\n  marriage or in some other manner so as to evidence an intent by the parties \r\n  to make it marital property.â€Â  Greene v. Greene, 351 S.C. 329, 338, 569 \r\n  S.E.2d 393, 398 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Importantly, transmutation is a matter of \r\n  intent to be gleaned from the facts of each case.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nHere, the family court specifically found \r\n  the items had been used throughout the marriage, and there was testimony that \r\n  Wife cleaned and cared for the personal property in the home.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  there was no evidence that the parties intended to keep the premarital property \r\n  separate and distinct.Â  Cf. Greene, 351 S.C. at 338-339, 569 S.E.2d \r\n  at 398-399 (finding no transmutation where the husband deliberately kept his \r\n  premarital property separate and distinct from the partiesâ€™ marital property).Â  \r\n  We believe the use of the property under this set of facts indicates that â€œthe \r\n  parties themselves regarded the property as the common property of the marriage.â€Â  \r\n  See Widman v. Widman,&nbsp;348 S.C. 97, 117, 557 S.E.2d 693, 704&nbsp;(Ct. \r\n  App. 2001).Â  Therefore, we reject Husbandâ€™s argument that premarital property \r\n  was not transmuted and affirm the findings of the family court.\r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Workersâ€™ Compensation Award\r\nNext, Husband argues the \r\n  workersâ€™ compensation award he received for injuries sustained during the course \r\n  of the marriage should not have been apportioned equally with Wife because the \r\n  award was based on future disability.Â  We disagree.\r\nOur supreme court has specifically ruled \r\n  that a workersâ€™ compensation award acquired during the marriage is marital property.Â  \r\n  See Orszula v. Orszula, 292 S.C. 264, 266, 356 S.E.2d 114, 115 \r\n  (1987).Â  This rule was reaffirmed in Marsh v. Marsh, 313 S.C. 42, 46, \r\n  437 S.E.2d 34, 37 (1993).Â  In Marsh, the court considered a personal \r\n  injury settlement and explained the family court should consider all of the \r\n  equitable division factors â€œand in many cases probably should[] award the proceeds \r\n  entirely to the injured party.â€Â  Id. at 45, 437 S.E.2d at 36.Â  Nevertheless, \r\n  the Marsh court affirmed an equal division of the proceeds from the settlement. \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Orszula and Marsh cases, \r\n  the family court properly considered the $24,000 workersâ€™ compensation award \r\n  as marital property.Â  Thus, our review shifts to whether it was appropriately \r\n  apportioned.Â  \r\nOur law is premised on providing \r\n  â€œthe family court the flexibility to view each case based on the individual \r\n  circumstances peculiar to the parties involved and to fashion a division of \r\n  the partiesâ€™ assets in a manner that is uniquely fair to the parties concerned.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 46, 437 S.E.2d at 36.Â  Furthermore, section 20-7-472 of the South \r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2003) vests in the family court, not the appellate court, \r\n  the discretion to decide what weight should be assigned to the various factors \r\n  of equitable apportionment.Â  See Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. \r\n  88, 100, 545 S.E.2d 531, 537&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001).Â  On review, we look to the \r\n  fairness of the overall apportionment; if the end result is equitable, it is \r\n  irrelevant that we might have weighed specific factors differently than the \r\n  family court.Â  Id.\r\nIn determining the equitable division of Husbandâ€™s \r\n  workersâ€™ compensation award, the family court stated:\r\n\r\nWife is entitled to one half (1/2) of the net proceeds of \r\n  [Husbandâ€™s] Workerâ€™s Compensation award with the money used to pay off the credit \r\n  cards and any outstanding doctorâ€™s bills from [Husbandâ€™s] injury being deducted \r\n  from the lump sum of $24,000.00.Â  Based upon the testimony received at trial, \r\n  Wife is entitled to $6,500.00 as equitable division of this marital asset.\r\n\r\nThe only evidence in the record about the award \r\n  is that Husband used $3,000 of it to reduce marital debt and gave $3,000 of \r\n  it to Wife in cash.Â  The record is devoid of any testimony describing Husbandâ€™s \r\n  injuries or explaining how those injuries would impact his ability to earn income \r\n  in the future.Â  Therefore, based on the evidence in the record, we find no error \r\n  in the family courtâ€™s apportionment of the award.Â Â Â  \r\n  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marital Residence  \r\nHusband next argues the marital residence, which \r\n  is titled in his name, was improperly apportioned.Â  We disagree.\r\nDuring the marriage, Husband traded land he owned \r\n  prior to the marriage for the lot on which he and Wife eventually built their \r\n  marital home.Â  In order to pay for the construction, Husband used $11,870 from \r\n  a premarital money market account, and the couple took out a mortgage.Â  The \r\n  cost of building the home was reduced because Husbandâ€™s brother built its foundation \r\n  and Husbandâ€™s father, who is a general contractor, completed the rest of the \r\n  construction for cost.Â  At the time of the partiesâ€™ divorce, the outstanding \r\n  balance on the mortgage was $31,544, and the equity in the home was $60,956.Â  \r\n\r\nThe family court apportioned the property by giving \r\n  Husband a special equity in the house for $10,000, the value of the lot, and \r\n  $11,870, the value of the money market account.Â  The remainder of the equity \r\n  in the home was divided equally between the parties.Â  \r\nHusband argues the value of the time, labor, and \r\n  money his family invested in the home should be excluded from its equity.Â  Husband \r\n  relies on Sexton v. Sexton, 308 S.C. 37, 43, 416 S.E.2d 649, 654 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1992), and the statement that â€œ[t]he fact a substantial portion of the \r\n  value of the house is attributable to contributions made by the husbandâ€™s family \r\n  should be a consideration in this case.â€Â  However, in Sexton, the court \r\n  was concerned the family court judge had not made any specific findings regarding \r\n  the equitable division factors.Â  Id.Â  Here, the family court did specifically \r\n  consider the equitable division factors in its order.Â  Additionally, in Sexton, \r\n  the parties only lived in the house for one year prior to initiation of litigation, \r\n  whereas in this case, the couple lived in the house for over five years prior \r\n  to Wifeâ€™s discovery of Husbandâ€™s infidelity and initiation of the litigation.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  We therefore find no abuse in discretion of the family courtâ€™s equitable \r\n  division.\r\n  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Child Custody  \r\nHusband argues the family \r\n  court erred by granting primary placement of the child with Wife.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\nIn a custody case, the best interest of the child \r\n  is the controlling factor.Â  Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 526, 599 S.E.2d \r\n  114, 119&nbsp;(2004).Â  To assess the best interest of the child, the court should \r\n  consider several factors, including: â€œwho has been the primary caretaker; the \r\n  conduct, attributes, and fitness of the parents; the opinions of third parties \r\n  (including GAL, expert witnesses, and the children); and the age, health, and \r\n  sex of the children.â€Â  Patel v. Patel,&nbsp;347 S.C. 281, 285, 555 S.E.2d \r\n  386, 388&nbsp;(2001).Â  Over time, it has become customary for the family court \r\n  to appoint a guardian ad litem in private custody disputes.Â  The guardian ad \r\n  litem operates as a representative of the court and assists by advocating for \r\n  the childâ€™s best interests and providing the court an objective view.Â  Id. \r\n  at 287, 555 S.E.2d at 389.Â  \r\nIn this case, the guardian \r\n  ad litem recommended joint physical custody so that the child could spend an \r\n  equal amount of time with each parent.Â  The family court awarded joint custody, \r\n  but it was arranged so that Wife would be the primary custodian.Â  The court \r\n  crafted a detailed and generous visitation schedule, granting Husband visitation \r\n  every Wednesday and every other weekend. The family court also divided holidays \r\n  and birthdays equally between the parties.Â  \r\nThe guardian ad litemâ€™s recommendation \r\n  resulted from his perception that the conflict between the parties would continue, \r\n  and he believed the child would remain a tool for Wifeâ€™s use in a power struggle \r\n  with Husband.Â  By giving the parties joint physical custody, the guardian believed \r\n  â€œeveryone is going to know that they donâ€™t have any kind of power over the other \r\n  person.â€Â  \r\nWe are also concerned \r\n  about a pattern of behavior directed against Husband by Wife.Â  Wife has made \r\n  unsubstantiated allegations that childâ€™s paternal grandmother sexually abused \r\n  the child.Â  She had Husband arrested for trespass when he arrived for visitation, \r\n  and they had a misunderstanding regarding the details of the prior visitation \r\n  order.Â  She confronted Husband at the county fair when she and the child saw \r\n  Husband there with his paramour and her son.Â  Finally, she has caused the school \r\n  to refuse the Husband access to child.Â  While Wife is certainly allowed to be \r\n  angry about the dissolution of the marriage, she must also understand the best \r\n  interests of her child require her to be civil and work with Husband.\r\nDespite our concerns, we find no error in the family \r\n  courtâ€™s decision to grant primary custody to Wife even though the guardian ad \r\n  litem recommended otherwise.Â  Initially, we note that the family court is not \r\n  bound by a guardianâ€™s recommendation.Â  Pirayesh v. Pirayesh, 359 S.C. \r\n  284, 296, 596 S.E.2d 505, 512&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  Moreover, true joint custody, \r\n  as the guardian recommended, should only be awarded where there are exceptional \r\n  circumstances.Â  Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 528-29, 599 S.E.2d 114, \r\n  121&nbsp;(2004); see also Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 125, 579 \r\n  S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003) (stating joint physical custody is usually harmful to \r\n  the best interests and welfare of a child).Â Â  Here, the reason the guardian \r\n  gave for recommending joint custody stemmed from his concern that the child \r\n  would be used as a pawn in the partiesâ€™ disputes.Â  The family court ameliorated \r\n  this concern by issuing an order with specific visitation instructions.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  the tension between the parties would make joint physical custody of the child \r\n  extremely difficult.Â  We therefore find no error in the family courtâ€™s custody \r\n  arrangement. \r\n  5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Private School Tuition  \r\nHusband also asserts the family court erred by \r\n  failing to consider the child support guidelines when ordering him to pay half \r\n  of the childâ€™s private school tuition.Â  We agree.\r\nThe court found â€œthe [Husband] voluntarily offered \r\n  to pay the tuition at trial and that he is paying child support pursuant to \r\n  the guidelines.â€Â Â  From an examination of Wifeâ€™s financial declaration, it appears \r\n  Husbandâ€™s monthly share of the tuition is $316.Â  However, at trial, Husband \r\n  only agreed to pay private school tuition if there was split custody, and he \r\n  stated that if he had to pay a greater amount of child support, he would not \r\n  be able to afford his share of private school. Therefore, the courtâ€™s order \r\n  was based on a misapprehension of the testimony.Â Â  \r\nThe child support guidelines specifically allow \r\n  deviations to account for the educational expenses of the child, but also require \r\n  the deviations to be supported by â€œwritten findings that clearly state the nature \r\n  and extent of the variation.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4710 (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\n  This court cannot find written findings to sufficiently support the decision \r\n  on this issue, and therefore, we remand this issue to the family court for consideration \r\n  of how the tuition requirements would impact the Husbandâ€™s child support obligations.Â  \r\n\r\n  6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attorneyâ€™s Fees  \r\nHusband argues the court erred by awarding Wife \r\n  $5,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Initially, Husband admits he is at fault for the \r\n  divorce, but seeks to temper this with the family courtâ€™s finding that he had \r\n  informed Wife prior to committing adultery of his desire to separate.Â  Husband \r\n  also points to the courtâ€™s findings that Wifeâ€™s â€œactions have aggravated the \r\n  litigation.â€Â  We find these arguments unavailing.\r\nThe award of attorneyâ€™s fees is a matter left to \r\n  the discretion of the family court judge and will not be overturned absent an \r\n  abuse of that discretion.Â  Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 365, 384 \r\n  S.E.2d 741, 748 (1989).Â  To determine whether to award a party attorneyâ€™s fees, \r\n  the family court should consider each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own \r\n  fees, the beneficial results obtained by the attorney; the partiesâ€™ respective \r\n  financial conditions, and the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of \r\n  living.Â  Griffith v.

Robinson, of Camden, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Gary Gene Melton brought this \r\n  action against his former wife, Deborah J. Melton, seeking a termination or \r\n  reduction in alimony based on his substantial change of circumstances.Â  The \r\n  family court refused to modify Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were divorced in\r\n2001, after thirty-one years of marriage. At the time of the divorce, Husband\r\nhad retired from the military and was employed as a bombing range manager for\r\nthe Dare County Air Force Bombing Range.&nbsp; Between his retirement benefits\r\nand his salary as a bombing range manager, Husband's monthly income was\r\n$5,361.&nbsp; Wife, on the other hand, had a monthly income of approximately\r\n$227, which she earned from rents and from caring for her grandchildren, her\r\nbrother, and her father. [1] &nbsp;&nbsp; The parties agreed Wife was entitled to\r\nhalf of Husband's retirement benefits, and the family court awarded Wife an\r\nadditional $1,000 in alimony per month.\r\n\r\nApproximately four months after the divorce, Husband was terminated from his job\r\nat the bombing range.&nbsp; The month following the loss of his employment,\r\nHusband filed an action with the family court to terminate or reduce his alimony\r\nobligation.&nbsp; By way of counterclaim, Wife sought an order from the family\r\ncourt that required Husband to (1) pay his monthly alimony obligation to the\r\ncourt, (2) submit to a medical exam for life insurance purposes, and (3) pay her\r\nattorney's fees and court costs. A pendente lite hearing was held in November of\r\n2001, and at that time, the family court denied Husband's request for relief\r\n   Two weeks after Husband filed his \r\n    complaint, Wife filed a rule to show cause, alleging Husband was in contempt \r\n    of the divorce decree for failing to pay alimony in a timely fashion.Â  Judge \r\n    Brooks P. Goldsmith continued the rule to show cause and ordered that it be \r\n    heard at the same time as the hearing on the merits for Husbandâ€™s action to \r\n    reduce or terminate alimony.\r\n  In February of 2002, six months after \r\n    being terminated from the bombing range, Husband acquired a job at Miller \r\n    Trophy Room Preservation making ten dollars an hour.Â  Husband also earned \r\n    money from renting out a house and large tract of land he owned. \r\nIn March of 2003, a hearing on the\r\nmerits was held.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the hearing, Husband testified that he\r\nreceived&nbsp; $2,239 per month from his salary at Miller Trophy, $884 per month\r\nin retirement benefits, and $440 per month in rental income.&nbsp; Thus, his\r\ntotal monthly income was $3,563.&nbsp; On Husband's financial declaration, he\r\nlisted $3,767 worth of monthly expenses, which included his monthly alimony\r\nobligation of $1,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe family court found that although the loss of Husband's job was &quot;an\r\nimportant change,&quot; he was not entitled to a reduction in alimony.&nbsp; The\r\ncourt explained that Husband had not only replaced a great deal of his lost\r\nincome, but also that Husband's expenses had decreased significantly since\r\nalimony had originally been set.&nbsp; Specifically, the court noted that\r\nHusband no longer paid $125 a month to rent out a mobile home lot; he no longer\r\npaid $1,061.31 a month for his half of the mortgage on and upkeep for the\r\nmarital home; he no longer paid $238 a month toward his pension; and he no longer paid $177 a month for life \r\n    insurance.Â  Pursuant to its determination not to reduce Husbandâ€™s alimony, \r\n    the family court awarded Wife $4,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  However, the court \r\n    declined to hold Husband in contempt for his failure to make timely alimony \r\n    payments, noting the late payments occurred after Husband initially lost his \r\n    job and finding Husbandâ€™s failure to pay on time was not willful. Â \r\nHusband appeals, arguing the family\r\ncourt erred by not reducing or terminating his alimony and by awarding Wife\r\nattorney's fees.&nbsp;\r\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n    The family court has the authority to alter \r\n      alimony payments upon a proper showing of a change of condition.Â  S.C. Code \r\n      Ann. Â§ 20-3-170 (1985).Â  The modification of alimony is within the sound \r\n      discretion of the family court and will not be overturned absent an abuse \r\n      of that discretion.Â  Riggs v. Riggs, 353 S.C. 230, 236, 578 S.E.2d \r\n      3, 6 (2003). \r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Reduction or Termination of Alimony\r\nHusband argues the family courtâ€™s failure \r\n  to reduce or terminate his alimony was an abuse of discretion for three reasons.Â  \r\n  First, Husband claims the evidence in the record does not support the courtâ€™s \r\n  finding that his financial condition had not substantially or materially changed.Â  \r\n  Second, Husband argues the family court abused its discretion by focusing only \r\n  on his circumstances rather than the circumstances of both parties.Â  Third, \r\n  Husband alleges the family court erred by considering â€œthe Traxler Alimony guidelinesâ€ \r\n  when making its decision.Â  We disagree with all of these arguments.\r\nIn regard to his financial condition, Husband \r\n  alleges his expenses have increased since the divorce, pointing to the $3,767 \r\n  worth of expenses he has listed on his current financial declaration as compared \r\n  to the $3,484 in monthly expenses he had when alimony was originally set.Â  However, \r\n  included in Husbandâ€™s current financial declaration is his $1,000 alimony obligation.Â  \r\n  Because the family court was asked to reconsider Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation, \r\n  the amount he currently pays in alimony should not be factored in as an expense.Â Â  \r\n  After subtracting the $1,000 from the $3,767 in monthly expenses, Husbandâ€™s \r\n  monthly expenses are $717 less than they had been when alimony was originally \r\n  set.Â  Furthermore, the deductions from Husbandâ€™s gross pay are less now than \r\n  they were at the time of the partiesâ€™ divorce because he no longer pays $373 \r\n  per month toward his pension plan. [2] Â  Thus, Husbandâ€™s expenses and deductions have \r\n  been reduced by nearly $1,100 since the partiesâ€™ divorce. \r\nPursuant to the original divorce decree, Husband \r\n  was required to pay Wife $1,000 in alimony in addition to his agreement to pay \r\n  her half of his retirement benefits, which at the time amounted to $850. After \r\n  paying these sums to Wife, Husband was left with a gross monthly income of $3,511. \r\n  [3] Â  From this monthly income, $373 was deducted to fund his pension. His \r\n  monthly income therefore was $3,138 before taxes, and his monthly expenses were \r\n  $3,484, [4]  leaving him with a $346 deficit each month.Â  \r\n  Now that Husband has a lower paying job, his monthly income isÂ  $3,563, [5]  and his expenses, including alimony, \r\n  are $3,794. [6] Â  Thus, his deficit is only $231 \r\n  per month.Â  Based on these numbers, and despite the fact that Husbandâ€™s expenses \r\n  exceed his income, we agree with the family courtâ€™s finding that there has been \r\n  no material change to Husbandâ€™s financial circumstances.Â Â Â  Eubank v. Eubank, \r\n  347 S.C. 367, 372, 555 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. App. 2001) (stating that, in order \r\n  to justify modification or termination of an alimony award, the changes in circumstances \r\n  must be substantial or material).Â  \r\nHusband also argues the family court erred by \r\n  considering only his circumstances and not the circumstances of both parties.Â  \r\n  We note initially that in Husbandâ€™s pleadings, the only change in circumstance \r\n  he specifically listed was his loss of income.Â  Moreover, the family court did \r\n  consider the Wifeâ€™s circumstances and found her â€œincome and ability to earn \r\n  income [had] not changed.â€Â  The evidence in the record supports this finding, \r\n  and we therefore find no error.Â  \r\nHusband also urges us to reverse the family court \r\n  because it considered â€œthe Traxler alimony guidelines.â€Â  Husband asserts this \r\n  was error because â€œthe guidelines are not approved for use for the family court \r\n  . . . and results are not subject to cross-examination and confrontation by \r\n  the parties.â€Â  Even assuming, without deciding, that the family courtâ€™s consideration \r\n  of the guidelines was error, Husband fails to demonstrate how the use of these \r\n  guidelines prejudiced him.Â  See Blakely v. Blakely, 249 S.C. 623, \r\n  625, 155 S.E.2d 857, 858 (1967) (stating that an alimony order will not be reversed \r\n  unless the alleged error is material and prejudicial to the substantial rights \r\n  of the complaining party). As shown above, Husbandâ€™s income and expenses had \r\n  not materially or substantially changed.Â  Therefore, regardless of whether the \r\n  Traxler guidelines were considered, Husband was not entitled to a reduction \r\n  or termination of his alimony obligation. \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nHusband next argues that the family courtâ€™s award \r\n  of attorneyâ€™s fees should be reversed because of the adverse impact they have \r\n  on his finances. [7] Â  We find no error in the family \r\n  courtâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees. \r\nThe award of attorneyâ€™s fees is a matter within \r\n  the family courtâ€™s discretion.Â  Miles v. Miles, 355 S.C. 511, 520, 586 \r\n  S.E.2d 136, 141Â  (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The factors to consider when awarding attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees are (1) the partiesâ€™ ability to pay their own fees, (2) the beneficial \r\n  results obtained by the attorney, (3) the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions, \r\n  and (4) the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  E.D.M \r\n  v. T.A.M, 307 S.C. 471, 476-477, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  In this case, \r\n  the family court specifically found that Husband had â€œsufficient income as well \r\n  as a great deal of assets out of which he can pay fees, while [Wife] generates \r\n  little income and has comparatively modest assets.â€Â  \r\nThe evidence in the record demonstrates that Husband \r\n  generates more income than Wife each month.Â  Furthermore, according to their \r\n  financial declarations, Husband has nearly $190,000 worth of assets, while Wife \r\n  has only $35,000 worth of assets. Â Thus, we find no error in the family \r\n  courtâ€™s decision to award attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife.\r\nHusband also argues that he should not have to pay \r\n  for the 2.7 hours Wifeâ€™s attorney spent working on the contempt action.Â  We \r\n  find the family court did not award Wife attorneyâ€™s fees for these hours.Â  \r\nWife requested that her attorney be reimbursed \r\n  for the 30.8 hours he spent on her entire case, including the contempt action.Â  \r\n  At her attorneyâ€™s rate of $150 per hour, Wifeâ€™s total fees were $4,620.Â  The \r\n  family court, however, only awarded Wife $4,000 in attorneys fees.Â  Thus, Husband \r\n  was not required to pay for approximately four hours worth of Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees, which presumably included the 2.7 hours Wifeâ€™s attorney spent on the contempt \r\n  action.Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find Husband was not entitled \r\n  to an alimony reduction or termination because he failed to show a material \r\n  or substantial change in his financial circumstances.Â  We further find the family \r\n  courtâ€™s award of $4,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife was not an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the order of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  In the partiesâ€™ divorce order, the family court noted that â€œ[Wife] \r\n    dropped out of high school in the 10th grade, marrying [Husband] \r\n    when she was 17 years old.Â  During the next 14 years, she and the children \r\n    followed [Husband] from military base to military base . . . .Â  These moves \r\n    were not conducive either to building up job skills or retirement funds.â€Â  \r\n    However, the court did impute to Wife a monthly income of $922, finding she \r\n    was capable of working forty hours a week for minimum wage.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  In its order, the family court found Husband no longer paid $238 \r\n    per month toward his pension.Â  However, the financial declaration Husband \r\n    submitted at the time of the partiesâ€™ divorce lists a $373.45 deduction for \r\n    Husbandâ€™s â€œretirement or pension plan.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [3]    Husbandâ€™s gross monthly income had been $5,361 at the time of the \r\n    divorce.Â  Taking away the $1,000 in alimony and the $850 in retirement benefits, \r\n    his gross monthly income was $3,511.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Or, if we were to consider alimony as an expense like Husband does \r\n    in his current financial declaration, Husbandâ€™s income immediately after the \r\n    divorce decree was $4,138 a month and his expenses were $4,484, still leaving \r\n    a $346 deficit.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  Husband makes $2,239 per month at Miller Trophy, \r\n    $884 per month from his retirement, and $440 per month from rents.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  We also note that two months after the partiesâ€™ divorce, Husband \r\n    remarried.Â  Although Husband admittedly includes some of his new wifeâ€™s expenses \r\n    on his financial declaration, he did not in turn include her monthly income \r\n    of $1,400.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [7] \r\n     Husband also argues that the award of attorneyâ€™s fees should be reversed \r\n    if we reverse the family courtâ€™s alimony decision.Â  Because we affirm the \r\n    family courtâ€™s decision not to reduce or terminate Husbandâ€™s alimony, we need \r\n    not address this issue.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, \r\n    Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (stating that appellate \r\n    court need not address remaining issues when disposition of prior issues is \r\n    dispositive).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-011","title":"Williamson v.

Parham, Jr. and Patricia \r\n  S. Ravenhorst, both of Greenville, for Appellant/Respondent.\r\nDesa A. Ballard, of W. Columbia, \r\n  for Respondents/ Appellants.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is a cross-appeal from \r\n  an action involving unfair trade practices, breach of fiduciary duty, unpaid \r\n  commissions, and frivolous proceedings.Â  Alfred C. Middleton appeals from the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s rulings on his motions for summary judgment, directed verdict, \r\n  judgment notwithstanding the verdict, sanctions, and prejudgment interest.Â  \r\n  He also argues the trial court erred by admitting a brochure into evidence.Â  \r\n  Dan F. Williamson and Dan F. Williamson and Company also appeal, arguing the \r\n  judge who awarded attorneyâ€™s fees did not have jurisdiction to do so, and in \r\n  the alternative, that the factors for attorneyâ€™s fees were not met.Â  We affirm \r\n  in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nWilliamson, the owner of a material handling \r\n  and packaging systems company called Dan F. Williamson and Company, employed \r\n  Middleton as a commissioned salesman.Â  After working for Williamson for several \r\n  years, Middleton voluntarily terminated his employment and began to work for \r\n  Peninsula Plastics, Inc., one of Williamsonâ€™s pallet suppliers.Â  \r\nBefore leaving Williamsonâ€™s employ, Middleton \r\n  sold products to Kaltex, Inc., and was due a commission.Â  Middleton claims he \r\n  sold two thousand pallets, which were to be delivered in four installments of \r\n  five hundred pallets each; however, Williamson claims Middleton only sold five \r\n  hundred pallets to Kaltex.Â  In any event, Williamson never paid Middleton any \r\n  commission for the sale even though it acknowledges that he was owed at least \r\n  $906.62.\r\nAlso prior to leaving his job at Williamson, Middleton \r\n  asked one of Williamsonâ€™s customers if he could use a photograph that was taken \r\n  at the customerâ€™s plant to advertise Williamsonâ€™s product in a brochure and \r\n  on a website.Â  The customer granted him permission, and the photograph was used \r\n  in Williamsonâ€™s copyrighted brochure.Â  \r\nAfter Middleton began working for Peninsula Plastics, \r\n  he was involved in creating an advertisement brochure for Peninsula Plastics.Â  \r\n  The Peninsula Plastics brochure was similar to Williamsonâ€™s brochure in many \r\n  ways, and the photograph used in Peninsula Plasticsâ€™ brochure appeared to be \r\n  the same photograph that was used in Williamsonâ€™s brochure, though Middleton \r\n  denied it was the same photograph. Â Peninsula Plastics also began selling \r\n  its products to customers who had formerly done business with Williamson.\r\nWilliamson filed a complaint against Middleton, \r\n  alleging causes of action for fraud, constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary \r\n  duty, and violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act. Middleton \r\n  denied the allegations and filed a counterclaim for commissions owed and sanctions \r\n  under the South Carolina Frivolous Proceedings Act.Â  \r\nPrior to trial, Middleton moved to dismiss Williamsonâ€™s \r\n  claims for fraud, constructive fraud, and unfair trade practices.Â  Williamson \r\n  voluntarily dismissed its claims for fraud and constructive fraud, and the court \r\n  denied Middletonâ€™s motion to dismiss Williamsonâ€™s unfair trade practices claim.Â  \r\n  At the close of Williamsonâ€™s case in chief, Middleton moved for a directed verdict \r\n  as to Williamsonâ€™s remaining causes of action for unfair trade practices and \r\n  breach of fiduciary duty.Â  The court granted the motion as to the unfair trade \r\n  practices claim but denied the motion as to the fiduciary duty claim.Â  At the \r\n  close of Middletonâ€™s case, Middleton again moved for a directed verdict on the \r\n  claim for breach of fiduciary duty, and the court denied the motion.\r\nThe jury returned its verdict in favor of Middleton \r\n  on Williamsonâ€™s remaining cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty.Â  The \r\n  jury also found in favor of Middleton on his counterclaim for unpaid commissions \r\n  in the amount of $906.62 actual damages.Â  Middleton moved for a judgment notwithstanding \r\n  the verdict and prejudgment interest, both of which were denied.Â  The trial \r\n  court also denied Middleton relief under the Frivolous Proceedings Act.Â  \r\nAfter the verdict, the trial judge, Judge Pyle, \r\n  informed the parties that Middleton was entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees but did \r\n  not set an amount.Â  Judge Pyle asked the parties to resolve the issue among \r\n  themselves, and he explained that if they could not agree, he would set the \r\n  amount of attorneyâ€™s fees for them.Â  Because the parties could not resolve the \r\n  issue of attorneyâ€™s fees, Middleton petitioned the court for assistance.Â  Following \r\n  a hearing, Judge Miller rather than Judge Pyle, awarded Middleton $35,000.00 \r\n  in attorneyâ€™s fees plus $2,209.27 in costs.Â  This cross-appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMiddleton argues the trial court erred (1) \r\n  denying his motion for a directed verdict as to Williamsonâ€™s claim for breach \r\n  of fiduciary dutyÂ  (2) denying his motion to exclude evidence regarding Williamsonâ€™s \r\n  copyrighted company brochure (3) denying his motion for JNOV (4) denying his \r\n  motion for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs (5) failing to grant his motion for summary \r\n  judgment as to Williamsonâ€™s claim for unfair trade practices, and (6) denying \r\n  his motion for prejudgment interest on the amount of damages awarded.Â  Williamson \r\n  argues Judge Miller first erred in concluding he had jurisdiction to award attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees and also erred in awarding fees because the factors supporting an award \r\n  of attorneyâ€™s fees were not met.\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Middletonâ€™s Appeal\r\n\r\n  a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe issue of whether \r\n  the trial court erred in failing to grant Middletonâ€™s motion for directed verdict \r\n  on Williamsonâ€™s breach of fiduciary duty claim is moot.  \r\n\r\nMiddleton first argues \r\n  the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion for directed verdict on \r\n  Williamsonâ€™s breach of fiduciary duty claim.Â  We find this issue is moot. \r\nâ€˜â€œA case becomes moot when judgment, if rendered, \r\n  will have no practical legal effect upon existing controversy,â€™ as â€˜when some \r\n  event occurs making it impossible for [the reviewing court] to grant effectual \r\n  relief.â€™â€Â  Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Herlong Pontiac-Chevrolet \r\n  Buick, Inc., 298 S.C. 299, 301 n.2, 379 S.E.2d 902, 904 n.2 (1989) (brackets \r\n  in original) (quoting Mathis v. South Carolina State Highway Depâ€™t, 260 \r\n  S.C. 344, 195 S.E.2d 713 (1973)).Â  Moreover, a party may appeal only if it is \r\n  aggrieved by the result of the trial court.Â  Rule 201(b), SCACR.\r\nIn this matter, Middleton received a jury verdict \r\n  in his favor at trial on the breach of fiduciary duty claim.Â  As a result, Middleton \r\n  is not an aggrieved party.Â  Therefore, this issue is moot.\r\n\r\n  b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThere was no error in allowing evidence regarding the copyright of the \r\n  Williamson Brochure. \r\n   \r\n\r\nMiddleton next argues the trial court erred in \r\n  allowing any reference to the Williamson brochure because the state law claims \r\n  of Williamson are preempted by the Federal Copyright Act of 1976.Â  Specifically, \r\n  Middleton alleges the Federal Copyright Act preempts and precludes any reference \r\n  of the copyrighted brochure in support of Williamsonâ€™s claim for breach of fiduciary \r\n  duty.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe admission of evidence is within the broad discretion \r\n  of the trial court.Â  Manning v. City of Columbia, 297 S.C. 451, 455, \r\n  377 S.E.2d 335, 336 (1989).Â  The trial courtâ€™s ruling will not be disturbed \r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nNone of Williamsonâ€™s claims against Middleton were \r\n  based on copyright infringement.Â  Thus, federal preemption is not an issue in \r\n  this case.Â  Instead, Williamson relied on the brochure, which was very similar \r\n  to Peninsula Plasticsâ€™ brochure, to support his claim that Middleton breached \r\n  the fiduciary duty he owed to Williamson.Â  Because the Williamson brochure was \r\n  relevant to Williamsonâ€™s breach of fiduciary duty claim, we find no error in \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s decision to allow the brochure into evidence.\r\n\r\n  c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe trial court did not err in denying Middletonâ€™s motion for JNOV. \r\n   \r\n\r\n Middletonâ€™s third argument is that the \r\n  trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment not withstanding the verdict.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn ruling on a JNOV motion, the trial \r\n  court must view the evidence and the inferences that can be reasonably drawn \r\n  therefrom in light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.Â  Steinke \r\n  v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 386, 520 \r\n  S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999). â€œ[T]he trial court should not grant JNOV where the evidence \r\n  yields more than one inference.Â  An appellate court may not overturn the decision \r\n  of the trial court . . . if there is any evidence to support the ruling.â€Â  Rogers \r\n  v. Norfolk Southern Corp., 356 S.C. 85, 92, 588 S.E.2d 87, 90 (2003).Â  \r\nInitially, we note that Middleton received a jury \r\n  verdict in his favor.Â  Therefore, the appropriate remedy to challenge the sufficiency \r\n  of a jury award is by additur.Â  See, e.g., Waring v. Johnson, \r\n  341 S.C. 248, 257, 533 S.E.2d 906, 911 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nFurthermore, we find sufficient evidence to support \r\n  the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  Williamson put forth testimony that the only amount owed \r\n  to Middleton was $906.62, exactly what the jury awarded.Â  Thus, the trial court \r\n  did not err in denying Middletonâ€™s JNOV motion.\r\n\r\n  d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial court \r\n  properly denied Middletonâ€™s motion for sanctions under the Frivolous Proceedings \r\n  Act.\r\n\r\nMiddleton next argues the trial court erred in failing to \r\n  award him sanctions under the Frivolous Proceedings Act. [1] Â  We disagree.\r\nThe determination of whether attorneyâ€™s fees should be awarded \r\n  under the Frivolous Proceedings Act is treated as one in equity.Â  Hanahan \r\n  v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 156, 485 S.E.2d 903, 912 (1997).Â  Thus, in reviewing \r\n  this issue, this court may take its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  \r\nSection 15-36-20 of the Frivolous Proceedings Act creates \r\n  a presumption that a person taking part in the initiation or continuation of \r\n  proceedings acted with a proper purpose â€œif he reasonably believes in the existence \r\n  of facts upon which his claim is basedâ€ and either (1) reasonably believes under \r\n  the facts that his claim may be valid under existing or developing law, or (2) \r\n  relies upon the advice of counsel, sought in good faith and given after full \r\n  disclosure of all facts within his knowledge.â€Â  Hanahan, 326 S.C. at \r\n  156-57, 485 S.E.2d at 912.Â  The rule of Hanahan states that â€œwhere a \r\n  party survives a summary judgment motion, it is not subject to sanctions after \r\n  a trial on the merits of the surviving claims.â€Â  Id.\r\nHere, Williamson clearly submitted evidence supporting his \r\n  claims, which is evidenced by the trial courtâ€™s denial of summary judgment on \r\n  his claim for unfair trade practices and the denial of a directed verdict on \r\n  his claim for breach of fiduciary duty.Â Â Â  Accordingly, under these facts, we \r\n  find no error in the trial courtâ€™s denial of Middletonâ€™s motion for sanctions \r\n  under the Frivolous Proceedings Act.Â  \r\n\r\n  e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trial court \r\n  did not err in denying Middletonâ€™s motion for summary judgment on Williamsonâ€™s \r\n  claim for unfair trade practices.\r\n\r\nMiddleton asserts the trial court erred in denying the motion \r\n  for summary judgment on Williamsonâ€™s claim for recovery under the Unfair Trade \r\n  Practices Act.Â  However, the denial of a motion for summary judgment is not \r\n  appealable, even after final judgment.Â  Olson v. Faculty House of Carolina, \r\n  Inc., 354 S.C. 161, 168, 580 S.E.2d 440, 444 (2003).Â  We therefore decline \r\n  to address this issue.\r\n\r\n  f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial \r\n  court erred in denying Middletonâ€™s motion for prejudgment interest on the unpaid \r\n  commissions.\r\n\r\nMiddleton asserts the trial court erred in not awarding prejudgment \r\n  interest on the award for unpaid commissions.Â  We agree.\r\n Section 34-31-20(A) of the South Carolina Code of Laws \r\n  (1976) provides:\r\n\r\nIn all cases of accounts stated and in all cases wherein \r\n  any sum or sums of money shall be ascertained and, being due, shall draw interest \r\n  according to law, the legal interest shall be at the rate of eight and three-fourths \r\n  percent per annum.\r\n\r\nPrejudgment interest is available only when the â€œsum is certain \r\n  or capable of being reduced to certainty.â€Â  Lee v. Thermal Engineering, \r\n  352 S.C. 81, 88, 572 S.E.2d 298, 305 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nIn this matter, the amount recovered by Middleton \r\n  for unpaid commissions, $906.62, was an amount conceded by Williamson from the \r\n  outset of the litigation.Â  Although Middleton sought money in addition to this \r\n  conceded amount, the $906.62 actually awarded to him was a sum certain that \r\n  Williamson admittedly owed. Therefore, the trial court erred in not awarding \r\n  prejudgment interest.\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williamsonâ€™s Appeal\r\nWilliamson appeals the trial courtâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees.Â  Initially, Williamson alleges Judge Miller did not have jurisdiction \r\n  to entertain Middletonâ€™s motion for attorneyâ€™s fees because Judge Pyle retained \r\n  exclusive jurisdiction over the matter.Â  Secondarily, Williamson contends Judge \r\n  Miller erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees because the factors supporting an award \r\n  of attorneyâ€™s fees were not satisfied.Â  We agree that Judge Miller did not have \r\n  jurisdiction to entertain the motion for attorneyâ€™s fees and remand the issue \r\n  to Judge Pyle. \r\nWhere a judge has jurisdiction to hear a matter \r\n  and the matter is heard before him, he entertains jurisdiction until his decision \r\n  is rendered.Â  First Carolinas Joint Stock Land Bank of Columbia v. Knotts, \r\n  191 S.C. 384, 395, 1 S.E.2d 797, 808 (1939).Â  Until written and entered, the \r\n  trial judge retains discretion to change his mind and amend his oral ruling \r\n  accordingly.Â  Ford v. State Ethics Commâ€™n, 344 S.C. 642, 647, 545 S.E.2d \r\n  821, 823 (2001).Â  The written order is the trial judgeâ€™s final order and as \r\n  such constitutes the final judgment of the court.Â  Id.Â  A trial judge \r\n  who controlled the case below retains control of any post trial motions.Â  See, \r\n  e.g.,Â  In re Beard, 359 S.C. 351, 358, 597 S.E.2d 835, 838 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2004) (holding a trial judge loses jurisdiction over a case when the time \r\n  to file post-trial motions has elapsed).Â Â  \r\nJudge Pyle presided over the trial in this matter.Â  \r\n  Following the jury verdict, Middleton moved for attorneyâ€™s fees under the Frivolous \r\n  Proceedings Act, but the trial judge denied this motion.Â  However, Judge Pyle \r\n  ruled Middleton was entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees a result of the verdict in his \r\n  favor on the commissions issue.Â  Judge Pyle specifically undertook consideration \r\n  of the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees, asking Middletonâ€™s counsel if he had a figure \r\n  â€œin mindâ€ for the amount that ought be awarded.Â  Before counsel responded, Judge \r\n  Pyle stated:\r\n\r\nWhy donâ€™t you do this?Â  Why donâ€™t you submit to [Williamsonâ€™s \r\n  counsel] what you perceive to be an appropriate amount?Â  See if you can resolve \r\n  it between the two of you.Â  And if you canâ€™t resolve it, then submit it to me, \r\n  and I will resolve the problem for you.\r\n\r\nJudge Pyle then reiterated, â€œAll right.Â  If you \r\n  canâ€™t get together and resolve it, then let me know . . . and I will resolve \r\n  it for you.â€ \r\nIn so stating, Judge Pyle assumed jurisdiction \r\n  until the final order was entered in the matter.Â  See First Carolinas \r\n  Joint Stock Land Bank of Columbia, 191 S.C. at 395, 1 S.E.2d at 808.Â  Because \r\n  the order was never reduced to a final order, Judge Pyle retained exclusive \r\n  jurisdiction over the award of the attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Id.Â  As a result, \r\n  we hold Judge Miller lacked jurisdiction to enter the award of attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  for Middleton.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe  AFFIRM the trial courtâ€™s denial of Middletonâ€™s \r\n  motions for directed verdict, JNOV, sanctions under the Frivolous Proceedings \r\n  Act, and summary judgment.Â  We also AFFIRM the trial courtâ€™s decision to allow \r\n  evidence regarding the Williamson brochure. Â However, we REVERSE the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  denial of prejudgment interest on Middletonâ€™s claim for commissions, and we \r\n  REVERSE and REMAND Judge Millerâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nAFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  S.C.

Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 42-15-40 (Supp. 2003) did not bar Doddâ€™s claim.Â  Dodd, as found by the commission, \r\n  suffered a repetitive trauma injury, an â€œinjury by accidentâ€ under the workersâ€™ \r\n  compensation act.Â Â  Pee Dee v. AVM, 352 S.C. 167, 174, 573 S.E.2d 785, \r\n  789 (2002).Â  In cases involving repetitive trauma, the statute of limitations \r\n  runs from the date of last exposure.Â  Schurlknight v. City of Charleston, \r\n  352 S.C. 175, 178-179, 574 S.E.2d 194, 195 (2002); \r\n  [1]  see also White v. Med. Univ. of S.C., 355 S.C. 560, 565-66, \r\n  586 S.E.2d 157, 160-61 (2003).Â  Here, the last day of exposure &#9472; when \r\n  Dodd engaged in the repetitive activity that caused his injury &#9472; occurred \r\n  on January 31, 1996, the last day Dodd worked for Exide.Â  \r\n2.Â  We do not address the issue, raised in Appellantsâ€™ \r\n  brief, of whether Exide received notice of Doddâ€™s accident within ninety days \r\n  of its occurrence as required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-20 (Supp. 2003).Â Â  The \r\n  trial court did not address the issue and Appellants never specifically raised \r\n  it to the trial court.Â  Winter v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guar.

Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 42-17-50 (Supp. 2003)Â  (authorizing the commission, among other things, \r\n  to receive further evidence and rehear the parties); Spearman v. F.S. Royster \r\n  Guano Co., 188 S.C. 393, 403-04, 199 S.E. 530, 535 (1938) (stating the commission \r\n  possesses broad authority to take additional testimony); see also 25A \r\n  S.C. Code Ann.

Titan Textile Co., 360 \r\n  S.C. 276, 289, 599 S.E.2d 604, 610-11 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Doddâ€™s work on the assembly \r\n  line involved repetitive grasping, gripping, squeezing, and breaking grids.Â  \r\n  On April 1, 1996, just a little over two months after Dodd left Exideâ€™s employ \r\n  and some fifteen to eighteen months after he began experiencing numbness and \r\n  tingling in his fingers, a physician diagnosed Doddâ€™s condition as carpal tunnel \r\n  syndrome.Â  A nerve study conducted by a physical therapist revealed Dodd suffered \r\n  from a â€œdemyelinating lesion of the Median nerves in the carpal tunnel [and] \r\n  distally at the wrists, bilaterally.â€Â  An orthopedist physician opined the cause \r\n  of Doddâ€™s carpal tunnel syndrome was most probably due to the type of work Dodd \r\n  performed with Exide.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Appellants attempt to distinguish Schurlknight on the grounds \r\n    that the commission found Dodd sustained an injury by accident, not a repetitive \r\n    stress injury.Â  The commission, however, also found that Doddâ€™s injuries â€œwere \r\n    caused by repetitive trauma.â€Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-015","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, \r\n  Assistant Attorney General Deborah R. J. Shupe, all of Columbia; and Solicitor \r\n  John R. Justice, of Chester, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  David Carter appeals his conviction \r\n  for armed robbery, arguing the circuit court (1) lacked subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  because Carterâ€™s indictment was insufficient; (2) erred in admitting evidence \r\n  allegedly obtained unlawfully through a warrantless search; and (3) erred in \r\n  allowing the State to make remarks in its closing statement that were allegedly \r\n  prejudicial against Carter.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nCarter and an acquaintance, Marvin Thompson, were \r\n  charged with armed robbery in connection with the June 28, 2002, robbery of \r\n  the Stop and Shop convenience store in Lancaster. \r\nThe day after Carter was incarcerated on the charges, \r\n  he asked a sheriffâ€™s deputy to procure some papers from his home.Â  He specifically \r\n  instructed the deputy to go to the home, enter through its unlocked back door, \r\n  and go down the hall and through the kitchen to the living room, where a black \r\n  bag was located that contained the papers Carter sought.Â  The deputy complied, \r\n  and while walking through the kitchen saw a handwritten â€œstick upâ€ note stating \r\n  â€œI got a gun.Â  Put all of the money in the bag or I will shoot you.Â  Then lay \r\n  on the floor.â€Â  The deputy retained the note as evidence. Â At trial, Carter \r\n  sought to suppress the â€œstick upâ€ note, claiming it was seized through an illegal \r\n  search of his home.Â  The court allowed the â€œstick upâ€ note in evidence.Â  \r\nThompson pled guilty prior to Carterâ€™s trial, and \r\n  in so doing implicated Carter in the robbery.Â  Thompson subsequently, however, \r\n  retreated from his guilty plea statements implicating Carter.Â  Thompson was \r\n  willing to testify for Carterâ€”that Carter was not involved in the armed robberyâ€”but \r\n  he was concerned the State would retaliate against him for his change in position.Â  \r\n  The State informed the trial court that it had no intention of retaliating against \r\n  Thompson, and in this regard, the State granted Thompson immunity from perjury.Â  \r\n  Thompson did testify for Carter and claimed Carter had not been involved in \r\n  the robbery.Â  In its closing statements, the State suggested that Thompson, \r\n  in light of the grant of immunity, had nothing to lose in testifying for his \r\n  friend, Carter. Carterâ€™s counsel interrupted the Stateâ€™s argument and disagreed \r\n  with the Stateâ€™s use and characterization of the grant of immunity to Thompson, \r\n  stating â€œYour Honor, [the State] mischaracterized that totally about what he \r\n  had to lose if Your Honor remembers back to yesterday, thatâ€™s, in fact, not \r\n  the case.â€Â Â  The court allowed the State to continue its argument.\r\nCarter was convicted on the armed robbery charge.Â  This appeal \r\n  followed.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\nCarter first argues the indictment \r\n  was insufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction because the it cited \r\n  the incorrect statutory subsection and also failed to specifically alleged a \r\n  â€œcarrying awayâ€ of property.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œAn indictment is sufficient if \r\n  the offense is stated with sufficient certainty and particularity to enable \r\n  the court to know what judgment to pronounce, and the defendant to know what \r\n  he is called upon to answer and whether he may plead an acquittal or conviction \r\n  thereon.â€Â  State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 374, 580 S.E.2d 785, 791 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2003).Â  â€œThe true test of the sufficiency of an indictment is not whether \r\n  it could be made more definite and certain, but whether it contains the necessary \r\n  elements of the offense intended to be charged and sufficiently apprises the \r\n  defendant of what he must be prepared to meet.â€Â  Browning v. State, 320 \r\n  S.C. 366, 368, 465 S.E.2d 358, 359 (1995).Â  â€œ[I]n viewing the sufficiency of \r\n  an indictment we must look at the issue with a practical eye in view of the \r\n  surrounding circumstances.â€Â  State v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 130, 437 S.E.2d \r\n  75, 78 (1993).\r\nHere, the caption twice stated Carter \r\n  was indicted for â€œÂ§ 16-11-0330(B)Â  ARMED ROBBERY.â€Â  At trial, the parties agreed \r\n  that the indictment incorrectly referred to subsection (B) of section 16-11-330, \r\n  which addresses â€œattempted armed robbery,â€ instead of subsection (A), which \r\n  addresses â€œarmed robbery.â€Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-330 (1976).Â Â  \r\n  The court allowed the State to amend the typographical error at trial over Carterâ€™s \r\n  objection.Â  We find that this minor alteration merely corrected a typographical \r\n  error.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-100 (2003). \r\nAdditionally, the indictment stated:\r\n\r\nThat David Carter did in Lancaster County on or about June \r\n  28, 2002, while armed with a deadly weapon, to wit:Â  pistol, feloniously take \r\n  from the person or presence of STOP AND SHOP such goods or monies being described \r\n  herein as follows:Â  money with intent to deprive the owner permanently of such \r\n  property.\r\n\r\nCarter argues the indictment fails because it does not include \r\n  the words â€œcarrying awayâ€ to demonstrate the requisite element of asportation, \r\n  which means â€œtaking of an object with felonious intent.â€Â  Locke v. State, \r\n  341 S.C. 54, 57, 533 S.E.2d 324, 325 (2000).Â  However, we find that the indictmentâ€™s \r\n  language stating â€œfeloniously take from the person or presence ofâ€ the store \r\n  inherently includes the element of asportation.Â  See Id. at 56, \r\n  533 S.E.2d at 325 (â€œIndictment language â€˜taking of goods and/or monies from \r\n  the person or presence ofâ€™ alleged the substance of asportation . . . was sufficient \r\n  because asportation merely meant the taking of an object with felonious intentâ€).\r\nViewing this indictment \r\n  with a practical eye and considering the surrounding circumstances, we find \r\n  it sufficiently apprised Carter of the specific crime for which he was charged.Â  \r\n  In particular, we note the indictment stated he was charged with â€œARMED ROBBERYâ€ \r\n  and included the statute, albeit with a typographical error concerning the subsection \r\n  which the court was entitled to correct.Â  Furthermore, the body of the indictment \r\n  included the details of the circumstances Carter was called upon to defend and \r\n  alleges the substance of the crime charged, including the requisite element \r\n  of asportation.Â  Thus, we find the indictment sufficient to confer subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Admission of Evidence\r\nCarter argues the court \r\n  erred in allowing the â€œstick upâ€ note into evidence because it was seized pursuant \r\n  to a warrantless search.Â  We disagree, for we find evidence to support the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s findings.Â  State v. Brockman, 339 S.C. 57, 528 S.E.2d 661 (2000) \r\n  (the standard of review in Fourth Amendment search and seizure cases is limited \r\n  to determining whether any evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s findings, and \r\n  the appellate court may reverse only where there is clear error).Â  \r\nâ€œ[O]bjects falling within the plain view \r\n  of a law enforcement officer who is rightfully in position to view these objects \r\n  are subject to seizure and may be introduced in evidence.â€Â  State v. Brown, \r\n  289 S.C. 581, 588, 347 S.E.2d 882, 886 (1986).Â  Here, Carter admittedly asked \r\n  the officer to enter his home, specifically the kitchen area, where the note \r\n  was left open on a table.Â  Concerning the conspicuous nature of the kitchen \r\n  table, Carter acknowledged that anyone present in his kitchen, including law \r\n  enforcement, would see â€œanythingâ€ on his table.Â  These facts satisfy the plain \r\n  view exception to the warrant requirement.Â  State v. Abdullah, 357 S.C. \r\n  344, 349, 592 S.E.2d 344, 352-53 (Ct. App. 2004) (plain view exception to warrant \r\n  requirement requires that the initial intrusion be lawful, the discovery of \r\n  the evidence be inadvertent, and the incriminating nature of the evidence be \r\n  immediately apparent).Â  \r\nIII.Â Â Â  The Stateâ€™s Closing Statement\r\nCarter alleges the circuit court \r\n  erred in permitting the State to make a comment questioning the motive of Thompson, \r\n  the co-defendant witness who had pled guilty, been granted immunity, and then \r\n  testified favorably toward Carter.\r\nIn the present case, Carterâ€™s counsel asserted, \r\n  â€œYour Honor, [the State] mischaracterized that totally about what he had to \r\n  lose if Your Honor remembers back to yesterday, thatâ€™s, in fact, not the case.â€Â  \r\n  This interruption of the Stateâ€™s closing statement can hardly be said to constitute \r\n  a specific objection or a request for relief.Â Â  Even assuming counselâ€™s statement \r\n  may properly be construed as an objection, there is clearly no request for relief.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we find the issue unpreserved for appellate review.Â  See \r\n  State v. Black, 319 S.C. 515, 521, 462 S.E.2d 311, 315 (Ct. App. 1995) \r\n  (â€œThe proper course to be pursued when counsel makes an improper argument is \r\n  for opposing counsel to immediately object and to have a record made of the \r\n  statements or language complained of and to ask the court for a distinct ruling \r\n  thereonâ€); State v.

M. Manning Smith, of Beaufort, for Appellant.\r\nJ. Thomas Mikell, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is an appeal \r\n  from an order finding Elaine Averette Browning in contempt for building a fence \r\n  on property belonging to her brother, Danny Averette, as determined in an order \r\n  from a prior adjudication.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nM.C. Averette owned lots 9, 10, 11, and \r\n  12 of the North View Subdivision located on Port Royal Island in Beaufort County.Â  \r\n  On December 31, 1992, he transferred the property to his son, Danny Averette, \r\n  and his daughter, Elaine Averette Browning, by deed. Of the four lots, Elaine \r\n  was granted lot 12 and the â€œ[w]esternmost 60 feetâ€ of lot 11.Â  The deed stated \r\n  that the portion of lot 11 deeded to Elaine was bounded on the west by â€œan unnamed \r\n  18 foot road separating it from lot 12,â€ and on the east by the remaining portion \r\n  of lot 11, which was conveyed to Danny.Â  Danny was simultaneously granted lots \r\n  9 and 10, as well as the remaining portion of lot 11, described as â€œthat portion \r\n  remaining of said lot after the Westernmost 60 feet of said lot is simultaneously \r\n  conveyed to Elaine A. Browning.â€Â  Both deeds reference the subdivision plat, \r\n  which illustrates an 18-foot road running between lots 11 and 12.Â  This dispute \r\n  arose because the 18-foot road did not exist and lot 11 was actually bounded \r\n  on its west by lot 12.Â  Danny brought an action to have the master-in-equity \r\n  declare the true boundary.Â  \r\nThe master divided the property as follows:\r\n\r\nEven though there is no 18 foot road, I find that I can \r\n  best effect the grantorâ€™s wishes by following exactly what he says about the \r\n  division of Lot eleven:Â  [Elaine] is entitled to Lot 12 as shown on the plat \r\n  of Gasque and Associates 7/20/98 and the [Danny] is entitled to Lot 10 as shown \r\n  on that plat and other plats introduced into evidence.Â  Lot 11 shall be divided \r\n  as provided by the deeds quoted above between [Danny] and [Elaine]:Â  [Elaine] \r\n  shall have the Westernmost 60 feet of Lot 11 and [Danny] shall have the Easternmost \r\n  139 feet, more or less, making the line of division that [sic] found on Gasqueâ€™s \r\n  plat referred to above as the line running N33Âº26â€™36â€™â€™E.\r\n\r\nFollowing the order, Elaine built a wooden fence approximately eighteen \r\n  feet east of the dividing line marked N33Âº26â€™36â€™â€™E on the Gasque plat.Â  Upon \r\n  motion to hold Elaine in contempt, the master determined that the fence was \r\n  a violation of its order, Elaine was aware of the order, and her actions constituted \r\n  contempt of court. [1] Â  The court ordered the removal \r\n  of the fence within thirty days.Â  Elaine appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nElaine argues \r\n  that the trial court erred in its determination of the boundary line.Â  However, \r\n  she did not appeal the May 10, 2000 order of the trial court, which determined \r\n  the boundary lines of the respective properties.Â  Therefore, the boundary lines \r\n  articulated in that order are the law of the case.Â  See Tolerâ€™s Cove \r\n  Homeowners Assâ€™n v. Trident Constr. Co., 355 S.C. 605, 610, 586 S.E.2d 581, \r\n  584 (2003) (stating a finding that neither party has appealed is the law of \r\n  the case); Priester v. Brabham, 230 S.C. 201, 203, 95 S.E.2d 167, 168 \r\n  (1956) (stating an unappealed decision, â€œright or wrong, is now the law of the \r\n  caseâ€).Â  \r\nAlternatively, Elaineâ€™s remaining arguments assert that the May 10, \r\n  2003 order is ambiguous and lacks clarity such that it is unenforceable.Â  We \r\n  disagree. [2] \r\nâ€œThis court will reverse a trial courtâ€™s decision regarding contempt \r\n  only if it is without evidentiary support or is an abuse of discretion.Â Â  An \r\n  abuse of discretion can occur where the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an \r\n  error of law.â€Â  First Union Natâ€™l Bank v. First Citizens Bank and Trust Co., \r\n  346 S.C. 462, 466, 551 S.E.2d 301, 303&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001) (citations omitted).\r\nâ€œIt is well settled that contempt results from willful disobedience \r\n  of a court order; and before a person may be held in contempt, the record must \r\n  be clear and specific as to acts or conduct upon which the contempt is based.â€Â  \r\n  Cheap-Oâ€™s Truck Stop, Inc. v. Cloyd,&nbsp; 350 S.C. 596, 607, 567 S.E.2d \r\n  514, 519&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002) (quoting State v. Bevilacqua, 316 S.C. \r\n  122, 129, 447 S.E.2d 213, 217 (Ct. App. 1994)).Â  â€œA willful act is defined as \r\n  one â€˜done voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent to do something \r\n  the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law \r\n  requires to be done; that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard \r\n  the law.â€™â€Â  Spartanburg County Depâ€™t of Social Services v. Padgett, 296 \r\n  S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1988) (quoting Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary \r\n  1434 (5th Ed. 1979)).Â  However, â€œ[o]ne may not be convicted of contempt for \r\n  violating a court order which fails to tell him in definite terms what he must \r\n  do.â€Â  Welchel v. Boyter, 260 S.C. 418, 421, 196 S.E.2d 496, 498 (1973). \r\n\r\nWe find the May 10, 2003 order of the master â€œmaking the line of division \r\n  that [sic] found on Gasqueâ€™s plat referred to above as the line running N33Âº26â€™36â€™â€™E,â€ \r\n  clearly and unambiguously describes the dividing line between Elaine and Dannyâ€™s \r\n  property.Â  The fact that the master granted Danny the easternmost 139 feet, \r\n  â€œmore or less,â€ clearly refers to the inches the master excluded in making his \r\n  calculation. [3] Â Â  Moreover, \r\n  we find that Elaineâ€™s erection of the fence approximate eighteen feet east of \r\n  that dividing line to be a willful violation of the order.Â Â  For these reasons, \r\n  the contempt order of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., \r\n  concur. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Based on the statements in the masterâ€™s order, a hearing on the motion \r\n    was held on October 22, 2001.Â  A transcript from that hearing does not appear \r\n    in the record on appeal.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Arguably, this issue is not preserved for appeal.Â  Without the transcript \r\n    of the hearing, we are unable to discern what issues were raised to the master.Â  \r\n    Further, the masterâ€™s order does not specifically find the previous order \r\n    unambiguous.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 \r\n    S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for \r\n    the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the \r\n    trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Additionally, the deeds granting the property to both Elaine and Danny \r\n    excluded the inches and just used feet in measuring the division of the property.Â  \r\n    Only the plats introduced into evidence set forth the distances between the \r\n    property lines and the distances between the disputed lines using feet and \r\n    inches.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-017","title":"BB&T v.

Ingalls, of \r\n\r\nSpartanburg\r\n\r\n, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is an ongoing dispute \r\n  between two competing mortgagees originating from a mortgage foreclosure action.Â  \r\n  In a previous appeal, this court determined that BB&amp;T of South Carolina \r\n  held first-lien status.Â  On remand, the master-in-equity ordered John H. Franklin, \r\n  the other mortgagee, to hold the rents from the property in trust and to pay \r\n  BB&amp;T the principal and interest owed.Â  The order made specific findings \r\n  regarding the amount owed, the rate of interest and the date to which interest \r\n  would accrue, and the time for payment.Â  When Franklin failed to pay BB&amp;T \r\n  the entire amount owed, BB&amp;T filed a rule to show cause seeking to hold \r\n  Franklin in contempt.Â  The master reserved jurisdiction over the contempt action, \r\n  and pursuant to Franklinâ€™s request, ordered BB&amp;T to provide further information \r\n  and witnesses.Â Â  BB&amp;T appeals.Â  We reverse. \r\n  [1] Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThis \r\n  appeal stems from an action brought by BB&amp;T to foreclose on real property \r\n  owned by Lisa and William Kidwell.Â  BB&amp;T named John H. Franklin as a necessary \r\n  party and defendant.Â  Franklin counterclaimed alleging he had an $85,000 mortgage \r\n  on the property that was entitled to priority over BB&amp;Tâ€™s mortgage.Â  The \r\n  master-in-equity determined the Kidwells were liable on both BB&amp;Tâ€™s mortgage \r\n  and Franklinâ€™s mortgage and ordered a public sale of the property.Â  Further, \r\n  the master determined that Franklin was entitled to first-lien status and therefore \r\n  priority over BB&amp;Tâ€™s mortgage.Â  BB&amp;T appealed the masterâ€™s ruling.Â  \r\n  Pending the outcome of the appeal, the master stayed the public sale and ordered \r\n  that rents from the property be collected and held in trust.Â  On appeal, this \r\n  court reversed, finding BB&amp;T was entitled to first-lien status and remanded \r\n  the case to the master â€œfor a recalculation of the total sums due BB&amp;T and \r\n  Franklin.â€Â  See BB&amp;T of South Carolina v. Kidwell, 350 S.C. \r\n  382, 391, 565 S.E.2d 316, 321 (Ct. App. 2002) (affirming the masterâ€™s award \r\n  of prejudgment interest on Franklinâ€™s mortgage, but reversing the masterâ€™s determination \r\n  that Franklinâ€™s mortgage was entitled to priority and remanding for recalculation \r\n  of sums due BB&amp;T and Franklin). \r\nOn remand, the master determined \r\n  that the real property subject to the BB&amp;T and Franklin mortgages had been \r\n  sold at a private sale by agreement of the parties and that the sale proceeds \r\n  had been held in the attorneysâ€™ trust accounts.Â  Further, the master determined \r\n  that all rents from the property were collected and were being held in trust \r\n  by Franklinâ€™s attorney.Â  The master ordered Franklin to pay to BB&amp;T $106,065.24, \r\n  which constituted the principal as well as the interest that had accrued through \r\n  January 17, 2001, the date of trial.Â  The master also ordered Franklin to pay \r\n  to BB&amp;T interest in the amount of $27.27 per day for each day following \r\n  the trial through August 29, 2002, the date of the order on remand.Â  These interest \r\n  payments totaled $16,062.03.Â  Additionally, Franklin was ordered to pay interest \r\n  in the amount of $27.27 per day for each day after August 29, 2002 through the \r\n  date of receipt of the order by BB&amp;Tâ€™s counsel or â€œthe ending of any appeal \r\n  from this Order, by written notice of the Defendant Franklin or Order of the \r\n  appellate courts, whichever shall last occur.â€Â Â  All rents from the property \r\n  were ordered to be held in trust pending a further order or immediately paid \r\n  over to BB&amp;T for payment of the principal, interest, and attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  due.Â  \r\nFollowing the masterâ€™s order, \r\n  Franklin sent a copy of an undated and unfiled â€œNotice of Intent to Appealâ€ \r\n  to BB&amp;T.Â  After repeated requests from BB&amp;T for either a filed appeal \r\n  or written notice that Franklinâ€™s appeal had ended, Franklin notified BB&amp;T \r\n  that he abandoned his appeal on October 15, 2002.Â  After BB&amp;T received written \r\n  notice that Franklinâ€™s appeal had been abandoned, BB&amp;Tâ€™s counsel disbursed \r\n  the proceeds held in escrow.Â  According to BB&amp;T, after disbursing the funds \r\n  held in escrow, a shortfall of $3,313.42 remained on the money owed BB&amp;T.Â  \r\n  BB&amp;T requested that Franklin utilize the rents collected from the property \r\n  to pay that sum.Â  \r\nOn October 24, 2002, BB&amp;T filed a \r\n  rule to show cause seeking to hold Franklin in contempt for failing to provide \r\n  a detailed accounting of rents and failing to apply the rents towards satisfaction \r\n  of the debt owed to BB&amp;T.Â  \r\nOn October 25, 2002, Franklin sent BB&amp;T \r\n  a response [2]  and a subpoena \r\n  requesting that BB&amp;T produce all records concerning â€œa mortgage loan to \r\n  Lisa S. Kidwell and William Brian Kidwell dated November 5, 1999.â€Â  BB&amp;T \r\n  filed a motion to quash the subpoena alleging that the subpoena was improper \r\n  because BB&amp;T was a party, that the doctrine of res judicata barred Franklin \r\n  from asserting claims, that Franklin should be estopped from engaging in discovery, \r\n  and that service was invalid.Â  BB&amp;T also filed a return to Franklinâ€™s response \r\n  asserting, among other allegations, that the issues raised in the response were \r\n  barred because they had been previously litigated.Â  On November 22, 2002, BB&amp;T \r\n  filed a â€œCertificate of No Objection, Return nor Denial to Rule to Show Cause,â€ \r\n  which alleged that Franklinâ€™s response to the rule was unfiled and arguing that \r\n  Franklinâ€™s request for a recalculation of interest was affirmative relief which \r\n  had been fully decided by the 2001 order, 2002 opinion of this court, and 2002 \r\n  order on remand.Â Â  Additionally, BB&amp;Tâ€™s certificate stated that by agreement \r\n  of the parties a hearing before the equity court on the rule to show cause was \r\n  set for November 22, 2002.\r\nAt the hearing, the parties \r\n  addressed BB&amp;Tâ€™s motion to quash the subpoena.Â  The master asked Franklin \r\n  whether he had received the information requested.Â  Franklin responded that \r\n  based on the information he received, he was not clear when the mortgage on \r\n  the property had been paid off.Â  Franklin asserted that he was only liable to \r\n  BB&amp;T for rents on the property up to the date the mortgage was paid off, \r\n  and BB&amp;T conceded that point.Â  Franklin suggested that the mortgage was \r\n  paid off prior to the August 29, 2002 date that the master determined interest \r\n  was due through.Â  BB&amp;T asserted, however, that the issue was barred because \r\n  Franklin made no objection, made no post-trial motion, or appealed from the \r\n  order on remand, which set the dates interest would accrue through.Â  The master \r\n  concluded the hearing by ordering BB&amp;T to provide the court with information \r\n  as to when BB&amp;Tâ€™s mortgage account was credited with payment and how much \r\n  BB&amp;T received.Â  \r\nThe masterâ€™s written order determined \r\n  that he retained jurisdiction over the matter, ordered BB&amp;T to identify \r\n  the person who was the keeper of payments and disbursals made on the Kidwell \r\n  account, and ordered that person to be a witness at the merits hearing.Â  From \r\n  this order, BB&amp;T appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBB&amp;T argues the master erred in ordering BB&amp;T to \r\n  identify the person who was the keeper of payments and disbursals made on the \r\n  Kidwell account and in ordering that person to be a witness at the merits hearing.Â  \r\n  Specifically, BB&amp;T contends that because Franklin never appealed from the \r\n  masterâ€™s order on remand, the dates set in that order and the amount owed became \r\n  the law of the case.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nâ€œAn unappealed order becomes \r\n  the law of the case. â€˜A portion of a judgment that is not appealed presents \r\n  no issue for determination by the reviewing court and constitutes, rightly or \r\n  wrongly, the law of the case.â€™â€Â  McCall v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., \r\n  359 S.C. 372, 378, 597 S.E.2d 181, 184 (Ct. App. 2004) (citations omitted).\r\nIn this case, Franklin never \r\n  appealed from the masterâ€™s order on remand, which (1) held Franklin was liable \r\n  on interest that accrued, not only through August 29, 2002, but through the \r\n  date BB&amp;T received written notice of the conclusion of any appeal from that \r\n  order, and (2) ordered Franklin to hold all rents from the property in trust \r\n  pending a further order or immediately pay over rents to BB&amp;T for payment \r\n  of the principal, interest, and attorneyâ€™s fees due.Â  Because Franklin never \r\n  appealed from this order, Franklin is liable on the interest that accrued through \r\n  October 15, 2002, the date Franklin notified BB&amp;T in writing that he abandoned \r\n  his appeal.Â  Moreover, Franklin was obligated by that order to hold all rents \r\n  in trust for payment of his liability.Â  The date that payment was made on the \r\n  mortgage was simply irrelevant in light of this order.Â Â  \r\nAny argument Franklin had concerning \r\n  the date payment was made on the mortgage and its effect on the amount he owed \r\n  to BB&amp;T in rents should have been raised on appeal from the order on remand.Â  \r\n  Because Franklin did not appeal from the order on remand, it is the law of the \r\n  case.Â  See id.Â  Therefore, the master erred in ordering BB&amp;T \r\n  to provide any information or witnesses concerning the mortgage payments and \r\n  disbursals. \r\nREVERSED.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, \r\n  all of Columbia; and Solicitor Ralph E. Hoisington, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Charles B. Byers appeals a \r\n  circuit courtâ€™s determination that his indictment sufficiently conferred subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nIn December 1999, Byers was convicted of murder \r\n  and sentenced to life imprisonment.Â  Subsequently, Byers appealed the conviction \r\n  to this Court.Â  In State v. Byers, 2002-UP-486 (Ct. App. 2002), we remanded \r\n  the case for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the circuit court possessed \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction in light of the fact that the indictment in the \r\n  record did not indicate whether it was true billed.Â  \r\nThe remand hearing was held on December 12, 2002.Â  \r\n  The circuit court considered a variety of evidence, including indictments, testimony \r\n  from Carla D. Hartley, grand jury foreperson at the time of the disputed indictment, \r\n  and Sharon Cato, an employee in the county clerk of courtâ€™s office.Â  \r\nThere are two indictments that are relevant to \r\n  the current appeal.Â  The First is signed by Hartley, and contains the notation \r\n  â€œtrueâ€ underneath the heading â€œVERDICT.â€Â  This indictment includes a \r\n  date of â€œ6/30/99.â€Â  The second indictment is also signed by Hartley, but underneath \r\n  â€œVERDICTâ€ the word â€œguiltyâ€ appears.Â  Beside â€œguiltyâ€ is the date â€œ12/8/99.â€Â  \r\n  Below these entries is the signature of the petit jury foreperson.Â  The circuit \r\n  court noted that two copies of the indictment existed because the original indictment \r\n  was redacted to omit the word â€œtrueâ€ for petit jury use.Â  \r\nHartley testified she was not the regular grand jury \r\n  foreperson, but served in the absence of the previously appointed foreperson.Â  \r\n  Although she did not have an independent recollection of Byersâ€™ indictment, \r\n  Hartley testified it was her signature and explained that during the grand jury \r\n  process, she wrote either â€œtrueâ€ or â€œnoâ€ on each indictment to signify whether \r\n  it was â€œtrue billedâ€ or â€œno billed.â€Â  Specifically, when questioned as to what \r\n  the word â€œtrueâ€ signified, Hartley responded that â€œ[i]t meant that the entire \r\n  grand jury had voted that this particular case was a true bill.â€\r\nHartley was also questioned about the role a bailiff \r\n  played in the grand jury proceedings.Â  She explained that when she got to court \r\n  and discovered she would be foreperson, â€œthe bailiff was the one that brought \r\n  me the information and told me what to . . . do and how to sign [the indictment].â€Â  \r\n  Later, she clarified that after the bailiff told her how to proceed and sign \r\n  the documents, he left the room, did not reappear until the grand jury was finished \r\n  deliberating, and only returned to usher in the next law enforcement officer.Â  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nByers contends the circuit court erred in finding \r\n  the State carried its burden of proof in showing the indictment properly vested \r\n  the court with subject matter jurisdiction.Â  He further contends the grand jury \r\n  proceedings were improper because of irregularities involving the role of the \r\n  bailiff in those proceedings.Â  We disagree.\r\nTypically, â€œa circuit court does not have subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction to hear a guilty plea unless the defendant has been indicted \r\n  by a grand jury or has waived presentment.â€Â  State v. Grim, 341 S.C. \r\n  63, 66, 533 S.E.2d 329, 330&nbsp;(2000).Â  The lack of subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  may be raised at any time.Â  Id. at 66, 533 S.E.2d at 330.Â  In this case, \r\n  Byers did not waive presentment and he asserts irregularities in the indictment \r\n  process.Â  Proceedings in a court of general jurisdiction, however, will be presumed \r\n  regular absent evidence to the contrary.Â  Pringle v. State, 287 S.C. \r\n  409, 410-11, 339 S.E.2d 127, 128 (1986).\r\nIn Byers first appeal we were unable to determine \r\n  from the record if the indictments were properly true billed and accordingly, \r\n  we remanded the case to the trial court for that determination.Â  See \r\n  generally Anderson v. State, 338 S.C. 629, 633, 527 S.E.2d 398, \r\n  400 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œIt is appropriate to remand to the trial court for a determination \r\n  when there is not sufficient evidence for the court to determine if the indictment \r\n  was true billed.â€).Â  The trial court heard evidence from the jury foreperson \r\n  and determined the indictment was properly true billed.Â  Byers argues the trial \r\n  court erred in ruling the State carried its burden of proof, and that such burden \r\n  is by clear and convincing evidence.\r\nMultiple South Carolina cases have been remanded \r\n  for a determination of whether an indictment was true billed, yet none of these \r\n  has enunciated the burden of proof the State is required to meet.Â  Byers asserts \r\n  the burden is by clear and convincing evidence and that this standard is supported \r\n  by language from Grim that â€œcaution must be exercised to ensure the presence \r\n  of subject matter jurisdiction.â€Â  Grim, 341 S.C. at 66, 533 S.E.2d at \r\n  330.Â  The State, on the other hand, urges the court to adopt a preponderance \r\n  of the evidence standard.Â  Because it is unnecessary to our decision in this \r\n  case, we decline to adopt any specific standard as the evidence in this case \r\n  fulfills either.\r\nIn Pringle, an indictment was stamped â€œtrue \r\n  bill,â€ but did not contain the forepersonâ€™s signature.Â  Pringle, 287 \r\n  S.C. at 410, 339 S.E.2d at 128.Â  The court pointed to testimony by the foreperson \r\n  that rather than signing the indictment, the usual procedure was to have the \r\n  clerk publish the indictment in open court after the grand jury returned a true \r\n  billed indictment.Â  Id. at 411, 339 S.E.2d 128.Â  The court determined \r\n  the forepersonâ€™s signature was not essential to the validity of an indictment.Â  \r\n  Id. at 410, 339 S.E.2d 128.\r\nAnderson  involved an indictment that did \r\n  not contain the term â€œtrue bill.â€Â  Anderson, 338 S.C. at 632, 527 S.E.2d \r\n  at 399.Â  The court remanded the case to determine if subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  existed because no evidence demonstrated that the indictment was true billed.Â Â  \r\n  Id. at 633, 527 S.E.2d 400.Â  \r\nUnlike Anderson, the record in Bultron, \r\n  contained extensive evidence that the grand jury true billed an indictment that \r\n  was not otherwise marked as true billed.Â  Id. at 328, 457 S.E.2d at 619.Â  \r\n  The record contained testimony from the county docket coordinator that during \r\n  the term containing the Bultron indictment, the grand jury true billed \r\n  every proposed indictment.Â  Id. at 329, 457 S.E.2d at 619-20.Â  This testimony \r\n  was corroborated by the testimony of the court reporter present when the findings \r\n  of the grand jury were announced and a legal secretary for the county.Â  Id.\r\nThis case is factually similar to Bultron, \r\n  in that there is uncontroverted testimony by an individual involved in the process \r\n  that this indictment was true billed.Â  This testimony comes from the actual \r\n  grand jury foreperson, who testified that the indictment was signed by her, \r\n  marked â€œtrueâ€ by her, and that by marking â€œtrue,â€ she signified the indictment \r\n  was true billed.Â  This evidence proves by either standard that this indictment \r\n  was properly true billed.\r\nDuring the hearing on remand, there was also testimony \r\n  that the bailiff provided directions to the grand jury foreperson.Â  Byers argues \r\n  such direction constitutes active participation by the bailiff in the grand \r\n  jury process, and that advice to the grand jury should only come from a judicial \r\n  official.Â  After a thorough review of the record, we find the bailiffâ€™s directions \r\n  were administrative in nature and made necessary by the fact the normal grand \r\n  jury foreperson was absent.Â  The directions were given within the first few \r\n  minutes of the jury coming together and the foreperson made it clear in her \r\n  testimony that the bailiff was never a part of deliberations.Â  We find these \r\n  actions to have caused no prejudice.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, \r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS,\r\nJJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [1] Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215,\r\n  SCACR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-019","title":"Currow v.

Glaze \r\n  (Wife), as security for alimony.Â  We affirm. [1] Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThis domestic relations action was originally heard before the family court \r\n  in 2001.Â  The family courtâ€™s 2001 order, among other things, granted the parties \r\n  a divorce, awarded alimony to the Wife, andÂ  required Husband to maintain a \r\n  life insurance policy naming Wife as the beneficiary.Â Â  Husband appealed, and \r\n  this Court, in Unpublished Opinion No. 2003-UP-258 (filed April 8, 2003), remanded \r\n  the case to the family court.Â  We held the court failed to indicate the basis \r\n  for its requirement that husband maintain a life insurance policy naming Wife \r\n  as the beneficiary. Â Further, the family court had failed to consider the statutory \r\n  factors for ordering life insurance as security for alimony.\r\nAccordingly, in September of 2003, the family court issued an order from the \r\n  hearing on remand, addressing the statutory factors.Â  The court reaffirmed its \r\n  2001 order establishing security for alimony in the form of life insurance.Â  \r\n  Subsequently, in October of 2003, Wooten v. Wooten, 356 S.C. 473, 589 \r\n  S.E.2d 769 (Ct. App. 2003) cert. granted June 24, 2004, was published.Â  \r\n  Wooten established that â€œa compelling reason must exist to warrant the \r\n  maintenance of life insurance by the supporting spouse.â€Â  356 S.C. at 476, 589 \r\n  S.E.2d at 770-71 (internal quotation marks omitted).Â  The Wooten court \r\n  further ruled the sole fact that a former spouse would benefit financially from \r\n  life insurance in the event of the payorâ€™s death did notÂ  establish a compelling \r\n  reason for requiring life insurance as security for alimony.Â  Id. at \r\n  478, 589 S.E.2d at 771-72.Â  Based on the intervening release of Wooten, \r\n  Husband filed a Rule 59(e) motion, which was denied.Â  He now appeals, contending \r\n  the family court on remand erred in its analysis and application of the statutory \r\n  factors set forth in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(D) (Supp 2003). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Analysis of Â§ 20-3-130(D)\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(D) (Supp. 2003) provides:\r\n\r\nIn making an award of alimony or separate maintenance and support, \r\n  the court may make provision for security for the payment of the support including, \r\n  but not limited to, requiring the posting of money, property, and bonds and \r\n  may require a spouse, with due consideration of [1] the cost of premiums, \r\n  [2] insurance plans carried by the parties during marriage, [3] insurability \r\n  of the payor spouse, [4] the probable economic condition of the supported \r\n  spouse upon the death of the payor spouse, and [5] any other factors \r\n  the court may deem relevant, to carry and maintain life insurance so as to assure \r\n  support of a spouse beyond the death of the payor spouse.\r\n\r\n(Alterations added).Â  \r\nOn remand, the family court examined each of these factors.Â  The first factor \r\n  is the cost of premiums.Â  The court found that Husband, who by that time was \r\n  deceased, had carried the policy in question for years.Â  The court opined that \r\n  the premiums up until his death â€œwere not considerable nor were they a new expense \r\n  related to the issuance of this courtâ€™s order.â€Â  \r\nThe second factor looks to insurance plans carried by the parties during marriage.Â  \r\n  The court noted that the Husband carried the policy in question during the marriage, \r\n  and therefore, it was not a new burden.Â  \r\nThe third factor, that of insurability of the payor spouse, â€œwas questionable \r\n  as both the [Husband] and the [Wife] were in demonstrably poor health.â€Â  However, \r\n  because the policy was already in place, the insurability of the payor spouse \r\n  was not an issue.Â  \r\nThe fourth factor is the probable economic condition of the supported spouse \r\n  upon the death of the payor spouse.Â  The record reveals that both Husband and \r\n  Wife were in poor economic condition.Â  Unfortunately, Husband died; it was found \r\n  that the economic condition of the Wife upon Husbandâ€™s death was poor.Â  \r\nFinally, the statute provides that the court consider any other factors which \r\n  the court deems may be relevant.Â  Here, the family court found that the alimony \r\n  awarded to Wife would have been a nullity without the insurance policy as appropriate \r\n  security.Â  \r\nAs instructed, the family court examined the factors established \r\n  by our legislature and codified in Â§ 20-3-130(D).Â  We find no abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Compelling Reason Standard/Wooten\r\nHusband contends that Wooten requires reversal of the family \r\n  court.Â  We disagree.Â  In its November 2003 order denying Husbandâ€™s Rule 59(e) \r\n  motion, the court acknowledged that it had â€œspecifically considered the case \r\n  of Wooten v. Wooten.â€Â  The citation of Wooten v. Wooten in the \r\n  Rule 59(e) order clearly reveals that the family court judge undertook an analysis \r\n  of Wooten concerning the compelling reasons test.Â  Based on the economic \r\n  considerations and the age of the parties as discussed by the family court in \r\n  connection with its analysis of Â§ 20-3-130(D), we conclude there was a sufficiently \r\n  compelling reason to require security for alimony in this case.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the order of the \r\n  family court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-020","title":"State v.

Elliott,\r\nSenior Assistant Attorney General Mark Rapoport, Office of the Attorney General; \r\n  and Solicitor Warren Blair Giese, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Tony Davis appeals his armed \r\n  robbery conviction asserting the trial judge erred in (1) failing to charge \r\n  the jury on the lesser-included offense of common law robbery where the evidence \r\n  showed he only had a BB gun during the commission of the crime and (2) sentencing \r\n  him to life without the possibility of parole when the prior armed robbery relied \r\n  on for sentencing was not final as it was a guilty plea for which he had not \r\n  yet been sentenced.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn June 29, \r\n  2000, Bi-Lo employee Robena Young became suspicious of a male customer who continuously \r\n  walked up and down the same aisle with a buggy, watching her and watching the \r\n  front office.Â  Robena then alerted employee Mary Baughman, and Mary then walked \r\n  to the scanner room to tell employee Jennifer McCollum.Â  As Mary stepped in \r\n  the scanner room and began to relay the information to Jennifer, the man came \r\n  behind Mary into the room, pretending to look behind the door to the scanner \r\n  room.Â  When Jennifer asked what the man wanted, he closed the door, pulled up \r\n  his jacket, and pulled out a gun.Â  The man pointed the gun at both women \r\n  and ordered them to the ground. Â Robena realized there was a robbery in progress \r\n  and alerted supervisor Robert Taylor.Â  Taylor went to the scanner room and knocked \r\n  on the door.Â  Upon hearing the knock, the man instructed the two women to stand \r\n  and pretend as if nothing happened.Â  The man then opened the door and attempted \r\n  to pull Robert into the room.Â  Robert and the man struggled, but Robert began \r\n  to comply because the man put the gun in Robertâ€™s side.Â  Just as Robert stepped \r\n  in the scanner room, the bookkeeper, Penny, opened the door to the cash office.Â  \r\n  In an attempt to get away from the man, Jennifer pushed Penny back into the \r\n  cash office, but the man followed Jennifer in there.Â  The man opened up the \r\n  cash drawer, grabbed a big handful of money, and fled from the store.Â  \r\nA few months later, Investigator Vinson showed the witnesses a photographic \r\n  line-up that included Davisâ€™ picture.Â  Mary indicated Davis â€œcould beâ€ the man \r\n  who robbed the store that day.Â  Jennifer and Robena both picked Davisâ€™ picture \r\n  without hesitation.Â  Davis was thereafter arrested and indicted for armed robbery.Â  \r\n  Following a jury trial, Davis was convicted as charged and the trial judge sentenced \r\n  him to life in prison without the possibility of parole.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Lesser Included Offense\r\nDavis first contends the trial judge erred in refusing to charge the jury \r\n  on the law of common law robbery because the evidence showed he used a BB gun \r\n  in the robbery.Â  We disagree.\r\nDuring the trial, the parties stipulated that Stateâ€™s Exhibit No. 16, a BB \r\n  gun, was found in Davisâ€™ possession in September 2000.Â  Jennifer McCollum testified \r\n  Exhibit No. 16 resembled the weapon used by the man who robbed the store.Â  Investigator \r\n  Vinson testified Stateâ€™s Exhibit No. 16 was a â€œCrossman BB gunâ€ made to look \r\n  like a â€œgovernment model 45.â€Â  At the close of the evidence, defense counsel \r\n  requested a charge on the lesser-included offense of strong armed robbery, asserting \r\n  whether or not the witnesses reasonably believed the BB gun was a deadly weapon \r\n  was a matter for the jury.Â  The trial judge determined the lesser-included offense \r\n  should not be presented to the jury under the facts of this case.Â  Thereafter, \r\n  the court instructed the jury on the law of armed robbery and submitted two \r\n  verdict forms:Â  guilty of armed robbery and not guilty. \r\n  [1] Â  \r\nA trial court must determine the law to be charged based on the evidence presented \r\n  at trial.Â  State v. Crosby, 355 S.C. 47, 51, 584 S.E.2d 110, 112 (2003).Â  \r\n  The presence of evidence to sustain a conviction for the crime of a lesser degree \r\n  determines whether such a charge should be submitted to the jury.Â  State \r\n  v. Atkins, 293 S.C. 294, 298, 360 S.E.2d 302, 305 (1987) overruled on \r\n  other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).Â  \r\n  Due process requires a lesser-included offense be charged to the jury only when \r\n  there is evidence from which it could be inferred that the defendant committed \r\n  the lesser rather than the greater offense.Â  Id.; State v. Murphy, \r\n  322 S.C. 321, 325, 471 S.E.2d 739, 741 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œ[W]here there is no \r\n  evidence to support a finding that the defendant was guilty of the lesser offense, \r\n  there can be no error in the failure to charge the lesser offense.â€Â  State \r\n  v. Gadsden, 314 S.C. 229, 232, 442 S.E.2d 594, 597 (1994).Â  Concomitantly, \r\n  where there is no evidence to support a jury instruction on a lesser-included \r\n  offense, a jury charge which effectively prohibits the jury from considering \r\n  the lesser-included offense cannot be error.Â  Id.  \r\nCommon law robbery is defined as the felonious or unlawful taking of money, \r\n  goods, or other personal property of any value from the person of another or \r\n  in his presence by violence or by putting such person in fear.Â  State v. \r\n  Drayton, 293 S.C. 417, 428, 361 S.E.2d 329, 335 (1987).Â  Armed robbery occurs \r\n  when one commits a robbery and either:Â  (1) he is armed with a deadly weapon \r\n  or (2) he alleges he is armed with a deadly weapon, either by action or words, \r\n  while using a representation of a deadly weapon or any object which a person \r\n  present during the commission of the robbery reasonably believes to be a deadly \r\n  weapon.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-330(A) (2003);Â  State v. Muldrow, 348 \r\n  S.C. 264, 267-68, 559 S.E.2d 847, 849 (2002).\r\nThe only evidence presented at trial indicates the perpetrator was \r\n  either armed with a deadly weapon [2] , or alleged he was armed with a deadly weapon \r\n  by action â€œwhile using a representation of a deadly weapon or any object which \r\n  a person present during the commission of the robbery reasonably believed to \r\n  be a deadly weapon.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-330 (2003). Â Mary Baughman testified \r\n  the perpetrator of the crime pointed â€œa large black pistolâ€ at her.Â  Robert \r\n  Taylor stated the gun used was a handgun, and that it was â€œlike a black gun \r\n  that an officer would carry.â€Â  He further testified that the gun â€œlooked real \r\n  to me.â€Â  Jennifer McCollum indicated the robber used a big, black handgun.Â  \r\n  When defense counsel asked Jennifer whether she understood Stateâ€™s Exhibit No. \r\n  16 was a BB gun she replied, â€œNo, Sir.â€Â  She testified she saw an object that \r\n  she believed to be an actual handgun, as opposed to a BB gun.Â  Thus, while the \r\n  question of whether a BB gun is a deadly weapon may be an issue for the jury, \r\n  the facts of this case show only that the robber alleged he was armed with a \r\n  deadly weapon by using a representation of a deadly weapon which the victims \r\n  reasonably believed to be a deadly weapon.Â  In other words, while there may \r\n  be a jury issue as to the first prong of Â§ 16-11-330, there is no jury issue \r\n  as to the second prong.Â  There simply is no evidence that Davis was guilty of \r\n  the lesser-included offense of common law robbery.Â  \r\nII. Sentencing\r\nDavis also argues the trial judge erred in sentencing him \r\n  to life without parole based on a prior guilty plea to armed robbery Davis had \r\n  entered but for which he had not yet been sentenced.Â  He asserts the lack of \r\n  sentencing prevented the guilty plea from being a final conviction such that \r\n  the trial judge could not consider it as a prior offense for sentencing purposes.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œIn the interpretation of statutes, our sole function is \r\n  to determine and, within constitutional limits, give effect to the intention \r\n  of the legislature, with reference to the meaning of the language used and the \r\n  subject matter and purpose of the statute.â€Â  State v. Ramsey, 311 S.C. \r\n  555, 561, 430 S.E.2d 511, 515 (1993).Â  â€œIn construing a statute, words must \r\n  be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced \r\n  construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation.â€Â  Id.Â  A statute \r\n  is construed â€œby determining its meaning from the language used and its subject \r\n  matter and purposes.â€Â  State v. Carrigan, 284 S.C. 610, 617, 328 S.E.2d \r\n  119, 123 (Ct. App. 1985). Â If a statuteâ€™s language is plain and unambiguous \r\n  and it conveys a clear and definite meaning, there is no need to employ rules \r\n  of statutory interpretation.Â  State v. Morgan, 352 S.C. 359, 366-67, \r\n  574 S.E.2d 203, 206-207 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Further, when the terms of a statute \r\n  are clear, the court must apply those terms according to their literal meaning.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  at 367, 574 S.E.2d at 207.Â  \r\nSection 17-25-45 of the South Carolina Code requires â€œupon a conviction \r\n  for a most serious offense as defined by this section, a person must be sentenced \r\n  to a term of imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole if that \r\n  person has one or more prior convictions for:Â  (1) a most serious offense.â€Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(A)(1) (2003).Â  It defines â€œmost serious offenseâ€ as \r\n  including armed robbery.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(C)(1) (Supp. 2003).Â  It \r\n  defines prior conviction as meaning â€œthe defendant has been convicted of a most \r\n  serious or serious offense, as may be applicable, on a separate occasion, prior \r\n  to the instant adjudication.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(F) (2003).Â  Finally, \r\n  it explicitly defines conviction as â€œany conviction, guilty plea, or \r\n  plea of nolo contendere.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(C)(3) (2003) (emphasis \r\n  added).Â  The plain meaning of the statute clearly indicates the trial court \r\n  correctly considered Davisâ€™s guilty plea when making its sentencing determination.Â  \r\n\r\nFurther, the legislative intent is clear from the history of Â§ 17-25-45.Â  Prior \r\n  to January 1, 1996, this code section provided, â€œfor the purpose of this section \r\n  only, a conviction is considered a second conviction only if the date of the \r\n  commission of the second crime occurred subsequent to the imposition of the \r\n  sentence for the first offense.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(B) (Supp. 1995) \r\n  (emphasis added).Â  The statute was amended in 1995 to delete the provision regarding \r\n  the imposition of sentence, and added the provision defining â€œconvictionâ€ to \r\n  include a guilty plea.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 (Supp. 1995).\r\nAccordingly, both the plain meaning of the statute and the legislative \r\n  intent clearly show the trial judge properly considered Davisâ€™ prior guilty \r\n  plea to armed robbery as a prior conviction of a most serious offense for purposes \r\n  of sentencing.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause there was no \r\n  evidence to support a finding that Davis was guilty of the lesser offense of \r\n  common law robbery, we hold there was no error in the jury charge which effectively \r\n  prohibited the jury from considering the lesser-included offense.Â  We further \r\n  hold the trial court properly considered Davisâ€™ prior guilty plea to armed robbery \r\n  in sentencing Davis to life without parole pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45.Â  \r\n  Therefore, the order of the trial court is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, \r\n  and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] While Davis couches his arguments in terms of the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n    failure to charge the jury on the lesser-included offense of common law robbery, \r\n    it should be noted the trial judge did in fact charge the law of common law \r\n    robbery in conjunction with charging the jury the law on armed robbery.Â  It \r\n    is clear, however, the trial judge refused to submit the charge of common \r\n    law robbery for the juryâ€™s consideration.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] SeeÂ  State v. Heck, 304 S.C. 345, 404 S.E.2d 514 \r\n    (Ct.

Dunagin pursuant to Rule 11, SCRCP.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nBB&amp;T brought a breach of contract \r\n  action against Mike and Eula Simpson after the Simpsons defaulted on their credit \r\n  card agreement.Â  The Simpsons, through their counsel, Dunagin, responded with \r\n  a general denial, and further stated they had retained counsel for the purpose \r\n  of filing bankruptcy, â€œin which this matter will be dealt with.â€Â  BB&amp;T moved \r\n  for summary judgment or in the alternative to strike claiming the answer was \r\n  filed for delay and violated SCRCP 11(a).Â  BB&amp;T also proceeded with discovery \r\n  and served interrogatories on the Simpsons.&nbsp; \r\nDunagin wrote BB&amp;Tâ€™s \r\n  counsel, acknowledging receipt of discovery requests and informing him â€œit is \r\n  estimated that the Simpsons will be filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection \r\n  within 1 to 2 weeks, therefore, we will not be responding to the discovery requests.â€Â  \r\n  Counsel responded by noticing the Simpsonsâ€™ depositions.Â  Three days prior to \r\n  the scheduled depositions, Dunagin again wrote to BB&amp;Tâ€™s counsel informing \r\n  him the Simpsons had filed a bankruptcy petition under Chapter 13, thereby staying \r\n  BB&amp;Tâ€™s action against them.Â  Counsel filed a motion for sanctions pursuant \r\n  to Rule 11, SCRCP, claiming the Simpsonsâ€™ answer â€œwas filed and served in bad \r\n  faith and purely for delay, and the Plaintiff is entitled to an award of fees \r\n  and costs from attorney Dunagin as a matter of law.â€ Â Following a hearing, \r\n  the trial court denied the motion for sanctions in a form order without assigning \r\n  specific reasons for the denial.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nBB&amp;T argues the trial court \r\n  erred in denying its motion for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs pursuant to Rule 11, \r\n  SCRCP.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe criteria for awarding sanctions \r\n  pursuant to Rule 11 are essentially the same as those for sanctions under the \r\n  Frivolous Civil Proceedings Act.Â  Father v. SCDSS, 353 S.C. 254, 262, \r\n  578 S.E.2d 11, 15 (2003).Â  The decision whether to impose sanctions under the \r\n  FCPSA sounds in equity rather than at law.Â  Id. at 260, 578 S.E.2d at \r\n  14.Â  In such an action, an appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in \r\n  accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  S. C. Const. \r\n  Art. V, Â§ 5; see also Townes Assocs. Ltd. v. City of Greenville, \r\n  266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  However, following a determination \r\n  of the facts, an appellate court applies an abuse of discretion standard in \r\n  reviewing the decision to award sanctions and the specific sanctions awarded.Â  \r\n  Father, 353 S.C. at 261, 578 S.E.2d at 14.Â  \r\nRule 11(a), SCRCP provides in \r\n  part:\r\n\r\nThe signature of an attorney or party [on a pleading, motion or other paper] \r\n  constitutes a certificate by him that he has read the pleading, motion or other \r\n  paper; and that to the best of his knowledge, information and belief there is \r\n  good ground to support it; and that it is not interposed for delay.\r\n\r\nUnder the rule, the court may sanction an attorney \r\n  for filing a pleading in bad faith (i.e., to cause unnecessary delay) irrespective \r\n  of whether there is good ground to support it.Â  Runyon v. Wright, 322 \r\n  S.C. 15, 19, 471 S.E.2d 160, 162 (1996).Â  The sanction may include an order \r\n  to pay the reasonable costs and attorneyâ€™s fees incurred by the party or parties \r\n  defending against the action brought in bad faith.Â  Id.; Rule 11(a)\r\nSCRCP.&nbsp; \r\n\r\nHere, BB&amp;T argues the â€œsole \r\n  purpose of the Answer was to detain and impair the authority of the lower court \r\n  and to delay and generate further injury to the opposing party.â€Â  As evidence \r\n  of bad faith, BB&amp;T points to Dunaginâ€™s general denial of the allegations \r\n  contained in its complaint, and her later decision not to respond to discovery \r\n  requests.Â  \r\nThe circuit court did not make \r\n  specific findings of fact or rule on BB&amp;Tâ€™s allegations of bad faith in \r\n  filing the answer. The courtâ€™s order simply stated, â€œPlaintiffâ€™s Motion for \r\n  Sanctions is DENIED.â€Â  The record does not indicate and BB&amp;T does \r\n  not contend it filed a 59(e) motion asking the court to provide the factual \r\n  basis for its ruling or address BB&amp;Tâ€™s allegations of bad faith.Â  \r\nHowever, the Simpsonsâ€™ answer clearly disclosed \r\n  their intention to file for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13.Â  Dunaginâ€™s \r\n  later correspondence with BB&amp;T explained the decision not to respond to \r\n  discovery requests was in anticipation of the Simpsonsâ€™ petitioning for bankruptcy.Â  \r\n  We hold these facts support the courtâ€™s conclusion that Dunagin did not engage \r\n  in sanctionable behavior in this case.Â  The record reveals her willingness to \r\n  disclose, at the first opportunity, the intention of her clients to seek bankruptcy \r\n  protection.Â  Consequently, after carefully reviewing the factual circumstances, \r\n  we hold the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying BB&amp;Tâ€™s \r\n  motion for sanctions pursuant to Rule 11, SCRCP.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nANDERSON, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., \r\n  concur.Â \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule \r\n    215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-023","title":"Cantrell v.

Lee, both of Florence, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this action for trespass and negligence, Larry and Juliette \r\n  Hill appeal the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to Carolina Power and \r\n  Light Company (CP&amp;L).Â  We affirm. [1] Â  \r\nBACKGROUND\r\nThe Hills own \r\n  a building in downtown Sumter in which they operate a beauty salon.Â  The property \r\n  was in the area of the City of Sumterâ€™s renovation project, which as to the \r\n  Hills involved replacing a wall on their property and relocating electrical \r\n  equipment from overhead to underground.Â  CP&amp;L provided, and continues to \r\n  provide, electrical service to the Hills and was directly involved with the \r\n  Cityâ€™s renovation project.Â  \r\nAccording to the Hills, \r\n  they did not consent to the installation of underground wiring or the placement \r\n  of transformers on their property by CP&amp;L.Â  Larry Hill said he told CP&amp;L \r\n  employees to stop digging on his property.Â  However, a CP&amp;L employee, Joe \r\n  Bailey, attested Juliette Hill consented to placing two transformers and underground \r\n  wiring on her property.Â  Also, according to CP&amp;L, Larry Hill contacted the \r\n  company and revoked consent as to the transformers but not the underground lines.Â  \r\n\r\nUltimately, CP&amp;L \r\n  placed the two transformers on adjacent property and the lines underground. \r\n  Â The underground lines provide electricity to the Hillsâ€™ building and an underground \r\n  junction box at the back of their building provides service to the adjacent \r\n  property owner.Â  Essentially, CP&amp;L merely placed underground the formerly \r\n  above-ground service and did so pursuant to its service regulations.Â  \r\nThe Hills filed suit against the City of Sumter, CP&amp;L, and other \r\n  renovation project partners.Â  The Hills alleged negligence and trespass, and, \r\n  as to the City, they also alleged inverse condemnation.Â  The trial court granted \r\n  summary judgment to CP&amp;L and partial summary judgment to the City on any \r\n  causes of action stemming from the â€œinstallation of the underground services \r\n  by CP&amp;L.â€Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Hills argue the trial court erred in granting \r\n  summary judgment to CP&amp;L.Â  We disagree.\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when no genuine issue of \r\n  material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter \r\n  of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the \r\n  evidence and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom should be viewed in a light \r\n  most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, \r\n  69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 439 (2003).Â  In reviewing the grant of summary judgment, \r\n  the appellate court applies the same standard as the trial court under Rule \r\n  56(c), SCRCP.Â  Id. at 69, 580 S.E.2d at 438-39.Â Â  \r\nI.Â  Trespass\r\nTo support their trespass cause of action, the Hills \r\n  use the laws of inverse condemnation to suggest CP&amp;Lâ€™s actions constituted \r\n  a taking.Â  In other words, they argue that because it did not institute an action \r\n  under the Eminent Domain Procedures Act, CP&amp;L lacked permission and authority \r\n  to be on their property, and thus trespassed.Â  \r\nTrespass is any interference with the property ownerâ€™s \r\n  right to the â€œexclusive, peaceable possession of his property.â€Â  Ravan v. \r\n  Greenville County, 315 S.C. 447, 463, 434 S.E.2d 296, 306 (Ct. App. 1993) \r\n  (citations omitted).Â  â€œThe essence of trespass is the unauthorized entry onto \r\n  the land of another.â€Â  Id. at 464, 434 S.E.2d at 306 (citations omitted).Â  \r\n  â€œTo constitute an actionable trespass, the act must be affirmative, the invasion \r\n  of the land must be intentional, and the harm caused by the invasion of the \r\n  land must be the direct result of that invasion.â€Â  Mack v. Edens, 320 \r\n  S.C. 236, 240, 464 S.E.2d 124, 127 (Ct. App. 1995).\r\nThe Hills are customers of CP&amp;L.Â  CP&amp;Lâ€™s service \r\n  regulations explicitly authorize its entry onto the Hillsâ€™ land.Â  The following \r\n  is stated in paragraph 2(a) of the regulations:\r\n\r\nCompany is not obligated to supply electricity to customer \r\n  unless and until: . . . in cases where it is necessary to cross private property \r\n  to deliver electricity to Customer, Customer conveys or causes to be conveyed \r\n  to Company, without cost to Company, a right of way easement, satisfactory to \r\n  Company, across such private property for the construction, maintenance, and \r\n  operation of Companyâ€™s lines and facilities, necessary to the delivery of electricity \r\n  by Company to Customer: provided, however, in the absence of a formal conveyance, \r\n  Company, nevertheless, shall be vested with an easement over Customerâ€™s premises \r\n  authorizing it to do all things necessary to the construction, maintenance, \r\n  and operation of its lines and facilities for such purpose.[ \r\n  [2] ]Â  \r\n\r\nThe Hills assert \r\n  these service regulations do not supersede the laws of inverse condemnation.Â  \r\n  CP&amp;L does not assert it is exempt from the laws of condemnation and inverse \r\n  condemnation.Â  Rather, it says the service regulations allow it to access its \r\n  customersâ€™ property to provide service and this permissive access defeats a \r\n  claim of trespass.Â  We agree.Â  Because CP&amp;L was authorized to be on the \r\n  Hillsâ€™ property, no trespass could have occurred.Â  \r\nII.Â  Negligence\r\nThe Hills also \r\n  argue their negligence claim against CP&amp;L should have survived summary judgment.Â  \r\n  The Hills allege CP&amp;L negligently placed the junction box, preventing them \r\n  from expanding their building and assert their affidavits were sufficient to \r\n  create a genuine issue of material fact.Â  Yet, in their affidavits, the Hills \r\n  fail to allege any negligent act on the part of CP&amp;L or demand CP&amp;L \r\n  move the junction box to allow them to expand their property.Â  Instead, the \r\n  Hills allege in their affidavits merely that they did not consent to CP&amp;Lâ€™s \r\n  actions.Â  Moreover, CP&amp;L has offered to move the junction box should the \r\n  Hills desire to expand.Â  Because there is an absence of a genuine issue of material \r\n  fact as to the negligence claim, the court properly granted summary judgment \r\n  to CP&amp;L.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n ANDERSON, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule \r\n    215, SCACR.

Thomas, of Columbia, \r\n  for Appellant.Â  \r\nCharles D. Barr, of Kingstree, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  William Poston appeals \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s denial of his motions for directed verdict, judgment notwithstanding \r\n  the verdict, and new trial.Â  Poston also challenges the admission of certain \r\n  evidence and testimony.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nIn her complaint, Ida Mae Keels \r\n  alleged Poston was negligent by failing to yield the right of way and failing \r\n  to keep a proper lookout after the parties were involved in a minor traffic \r\n  accident at an intersection in downtown Kingstree, South Carolina.Â  Keels claimed \r\n  she suffered permanent injury to her neck and shoulder and requested damages \r\n  of $50,000.Â  Poston denied Keelsâ€™ allegations and pled a comparative negligence \r\n  defense.Â  \r\nKeels was traveling eastbound across Mills \r\n  Street and Poston was driving north on Hampton when Poston struck the right \r\n  rear bumper of Keelsâ€™ car as she crossed the intersection.Â  The police officer \r\n  responding to the accident testified both vehicles were traveling at a speed \r\n  of between ten and twenty-five miles per hour, and damage to Keelsâ€™ car was \r\n  minimal.Â  The officer testified there was a stop sign posted on Mills Street \r\n  leading into the intersection, but not on Hampton Street.Â  \r\nKeels testified she obeyed the \r\n  stop sign, looked both ways, and then pulled up beyond the stop sign to make \r\n  sure the intersection was clear before proceeding.Â  Poston testified he was \r\n  driving slowly on Hampton Street, and when he neared the intersection he suddenly \r\n  saw a car coming across in front of him from the left.Â  He stated he tried to \r\n  stop, but could not avoid hitting Keelsâ€™ car.Â  \r\nPoston made timely motions for \r\n  directed verdict, arguing Keels had failed to present any evidence of his negligence.Â  \r\n  Although the trial court acknowledged the evidence supporting Postonâ€™s negligence \r\n  was thin and expressed concern there was no testimony about how Poston was driving, \r\n  Postonâ€™s motions were denied and the court permitted the case to go to the jury \r\n  on the question of comparative negligence.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe jury found Poston \r\n  100% liable for the accident and awarded Keels $35,000 in damages.Â  The trial \r\n  court denied Postonâ€™s motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a \r\n  new trial.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Motions for Directed Verdict, JNOV, and New Trial\r\nPoston contends the trial court \r\n  erred by denying his motions for directed verdict and JNOV, arguing Keels failed \r\n  to present any evidence to support a finding he was negligent.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen ruling on directed verdict \r\n  or JNOV motions, the trial court must view the evidence and the inferences that \r\n  may reasonably be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving \r\n  party.Â  Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567, S.E.2d \r\n  231, 236 (2002).Â  If the evidence as a whole is susceptible to more than one \r\n  reasonable inference, a jury issue is created and the motion should be denied.Â  \r\n  Bailey v. Segars, 346 S.C. 359, 365-66, 550 S.E.2d 910, 913 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001).Â  This court will not reverse the denial of a motion for directed verdict \r\n  unless there is no evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  South Carolina \r\n  Prop. &amp; Cas. Guar. Assâ€™n v. Yensen, 345 S.C. 512, 521, 548 S.E.2d 880, \r\n  885 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nPoston testified he did not see \r\n  Keelsâ€™ car until immediately before he struck her vehicle.Â  The jury could have \r\n  reasonably inferred from his testimony and from the location of the damage to \r\n  Keelsâ€™ car that Poston failed to keep a proper lookout before motoring through \r\n  the intersection and, as a result of his negligence, proximately caused the \r\n  accident.Â  See Cope v. Eckert, 284 S.C. 516, 519, 327 S.E.2d 367, \r\n  369 (Ct. App. 1985) (stating South Carolina recognizes a duty of care in keeping \r\n  a proper lookout for travelers on favored and unfavored roads); see also \r\n  Brown v. Howell, 284 S.C. 605, 609, 327 S.E.2d 659, 661 (Ct. App. 1985) \r\n  (affirming the trial courtâ€™s denial of plaintiffâ€™s motion for directed verdict \r\n  finding â€œthe jury could also reasonably infer from the evidence that [the plaintiff] \r\n  did not exercise due care for his own safety in that he failed to keep a proper \r\n  lookoutâ€).\r\nAdditionally, Keels testified \r\n  she stopped at the stop sign on Mills Street, looked both ways, and then pulled \r\n  up a little farther to make sure the intersection was clear before she proceeded.Â  \r\n  The jury could have reasonably inferred from her testimony that Keels indeed \r\n  stopped and, after determining Postonâ€™s oncoming vehicle did not constitute \r\n  an immediate hazard, proceeded lawfully through the intersection.Â  See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2330 (2003) (requiring that a â€œdriver shall yield the \r\n  right-of-way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway \r\n  so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time when such driver \r\n  is moving across or with the intersectionâ€).Â  Because a verdict for Keels would \r\n  be reasonably possible under the facts presented at trial as liberally construed \r\n  in her favor, Postonâ€™s motions for directed verdict and JNOV were properly denied.Â  \r\n\r\nPoston also argues the trial court \r\n  erred by declining to grant his motion for a new trial arguing Keels was negligent \r\n  as a matter of law.Â  We disagree.\r\nNegligence as a matter of law \r\n  cannot be established in this case unless the only inference that can be drawn \r\n  from the evidence is that Keels either â€œdid not look or did so in such a careless \r\n  fashion as not to see what was in plain view.â€Â  Crosby v. Sawyer, 291 \r\n  S.C. 474, 476, 354 S.E.2d 387, 388 (1987).Â  \r\nBecause the jury could have determined \r\n  from her testimony that Keels carefully looked both ways before crossing the \r\n  intersection, Poston cannot establish she was negligent as a matter of law.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, Postonâ€™s motion for a new trial was properly denied.\r\nFinally, Poston claims the trial \r\n  court erred by denying his motion for a new trial, arguing the amount of the \r\n  verdict was so excessive as to indicate that it was the result of passion, prejudice, \r\n  caprice or conjecture.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nWhen we review a juryâ€™s award \r\n  of damages, this court has a duty only to determine whether any evidence exists \r\n  to support the verdict.Â  Hutson v. Cummins Carolinas, Inc., 280 S.C. \r\n  552, 559, 314 S.E.2d 19, 24 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  \r\nKeels testified she suffered painful \r\n  injuries to her neck and shoulder that resulted in her inability to function \r\n  as she had prior to the accident.Â  She also testified about medical expenses \r\n  she had incurred as a result of the accident.Â  Her testimony meets the â€œany \r\n  evidenceâ€ standard to support the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  We therefore are without \r\n  grounds to grant a new trial.\r\nII.Â  Admission of Summary of Medical Bills\r\nPoston contends the trial court erred in \r\n  admitting a summary of Keelsâ€™ medical bills into evidence without requiring \r\n  her to produce the actual billing statements or evidence the medical charges \r\n  she incurred were related to injuries claimed as a result of the accident.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe decision whether to admit \r\n  or exclude evidence is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court \r\n  and it will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing the court abused that \r\n  discretion.Â  Gamble v. Intâ€™l Paper Realty Corp. of South Carolina, 323 \r\n  S.C. 367, 373, 474 S.E.2d 438, 441 (1996).Â  Moreover, whether a plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  medical bills are sufficiently related to the injuries sustained in the accident \r\n  from which the litigation arose is a question of fact for the jury to determine, \r\n  and only goes to the weight, not the admissibility of the evidence.Â  Pilgrim \r\n  v. Miller, 350 S.C. 637, 643, 567 S.E.2d 527, 530 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nAlthough Keels did not submit \r\n  her actual medical bills into evidence, she provided a summary of her medical \r\n  expenses and testified to its accuracy and to the relationship of the expenses \r\n  contained within it to the injuries she sustained as a result of the auto accident.Â  \r\n  We therefore conclude the trial court did not abuse his discretion in admitting \r\n  a summary of Keelsâ€™ medical expenses into evidence.\r\nIII.Â  Hearsay \r\n  Testimony\r\nPoston claims the trial court \r\n  erred in allowing Keelsâ€™ counsel to ask her a leading question during redirect \r\n  containing a hearsay assertion.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nOn cross-examination Postonâ€™s \r\n  counsel asked Keels, â€œTo your knowledge did Dr. Trefny, your family doctor, \r\n  attribute these injuries, your neck and your left shoulder, to this accident?â€Â  \r\n  Keels responded, â€œ[w]ell he treated me for it.â€Â  On redirect examination, Keelsâ€™ \r\n  attorney asked her, â€œDid Dr. Trefny indicate whether or not he thought that \r\n  the injury to your neck and shoulder came from the accident?â€Â  Keels attempted \r\n  to respond:Â  â€œHe told me had to come from that because . . .â€Â  Postonâ€™s counsel \r\n  interrupted Keelsâ€™ reply, objecting solely on the grounds her answer constituted \r\n  inadmissible hearsay.Â  The trial court overruled the objection, determining \r\n  Keelsâ€™ answer was â€œresponsive to questions posed during cross-examination.â€Â  \r\n  We agree.Â  \r\nOn appeal, Keels claims error not only \r\n  on the grounds of hearsay, but also that the question was leading.Â  No objection \r\n  was interposed on the basis the question was leading.Â  Therefore, that issue \r\n  is not preserved for our review.Â  State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 \r\n  S.E.2d 581, 584 (1989) (Appellant may not object to evidence on one ground at \r\n  trial and then argue an alternate ground on appeal.).Â  \r\nThe question posed on redirect \r\n  and Keelsâ€™ response was invited by opposing counselâ€™s questioning during cross-examination.Â  \r\n  Because Postonâ€™s counsel initiated inquiry into this subject, Poston is now \r\n  in no position to complain about a continuation of the same line of questioning.Â  \r\n  Kirkland v. Peoples Gas Co., 269 S.C. 431, 437, 237 S.E.2d 772, 774-75 \r\n  (1977) (holding a party may not complain on appeal of an error invited by the \r\n  partyâ€™s own conduct); Squires v.

Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; and Solicitor Randolph Murdaugh, \r\n  III, of Hampton, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The issue on appeal is whether a magistrate exceeded her \r\n  authority by imposing fines, administrative fees, and court costs when she sentenced \r\n  a defendant to consecutive jail terms exceeding 90 days on fraudulent check \r\n  charges.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn October 21, 2002, Herber E. Mixson was sentenced in magistrateâ€™s \r\n  court to 44 consecutive 30-day sentences on fraudulent check charges.Â  After \r\n  serving the first three sentences, Mixson had the option of avoiding further \r\n  incarceration by paying the amount of the checks plus fines, assessments, administrative \r\n  costs, and service charges totaling $166 per warrant and conviction. \r\nMixson appealed to the circuit court, contending that, under South \r\n  Carolina Code section 22-3-550(B), the magistrate was required to set an amount \r\n  of restitution in lieu of any sentence over 90 days and this amount could not \r\n  include court costs, assessments, and fines. [2] Â  The circuit court affirmed the \r\n  magistrateâ€™s sentences.\r\nPursuant to Anders v. California, \r\n  [3]  Mixsonâ€™s appellate counsel filed an appeal and a petition to be relieved \r\n  as counsel.Â  This court denied counselâ€™s petition to be relieved and ordered \r\n  the parties to brief the issues of whether the magistrate violated section 22-3-550(B) \r\n  by (1) ordering Mixson to serve consecutive jail terms exceeding 90 days or \r\n  pay fines in addition to restitution, and (2) ordering Mixson to serve consecutive \r\n  jail terms exceeding 90 days or, in the alternative, to pay administrative fees \r\n  and costs in addition to restitution.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDuring oral argument before the circuit court and in his appeal to \r\n  this court, Mixson argued that the language in section 22-3-550(B) requiring \r\n  a magistrate to â€œspecify an amount of restitution in damages at the time of \r\n  sentencing as an alternative to any imprisonment of more than ninety days which \r\n  is lawfully imposedâ€ precludes a magistrate from fining, assessing, or charging \r\n  a defendant after the first three offenses. [4] Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nNothing in section 22-3-550(B) limits a magistrateâ€™s authority to levy fines, \r\n  assessments, and court costs on defendants who receive three or more consecutive \r\n  sentences for fraudulent check violations.Â  This section does not specify that \r\n  restitution is to be the sole consequence of an alternative to imprisonment \r\n  of more than 90 days; rather, it merely requires magistrates to grant persistent \r\n  fraudulent check offenders the opportunity to shorten the time they must spend \r\n  in confinement.\r\nWe further agree with the circuit court that section 22-3-550 must \r\n  be read in pari materia with other statutes that address the jurisdiction \r\n  of the magistrateâ€™s court over fraudulent check charges. [5] Â  In particular, South Carolina Code section \r\n  34-11-90 provides that a fraudulent check charge â€œmust be tried exclusively \r\n  in magistrates courtâ€ if the amount of the instrument is $1,000 or less. \r\n  [6] Â  \r\nParagraph (a) of section 34-11-90 sets minimum and maximum fines for a magistrate \r\n  to impose for fraudulent check convictions if the offender is not sentenced \r\n  to imprisonment. [7] Â  Under paragraph (d) of this \r\n  section, a defendant convicted of drawing and uttering a fraudulent check or \r\n  other instrument â€œshall pay in addition to the fine all reasonable court \r\n  costs accruing, not to exceed forty-one dollars.â€ [8] Â  \r\nSimilarly, section 14-1-207(A) mandates that â€œa person who is convicted of, \r\n  pleads guilty or nolo contendere to, or forfeits bond for an offense tried in \r\n  magistrateâ€™s court must pay an amount equal to 100 percent of the fine \r\n  imposed as an assessment.â€ [9] \r\nConsidering all these statutes together, as we must, we hold the requirement \r\n  in section 22-3-550 for a magistrate to specify an amount of restitution as \r\n  an alternative to any imprisonment of more than 90 days does not restrict the \r\n  authority of the magistrate to order payment of fines, assessments, and court \r\n  costs in these cases.Â  Indeed, to hold otherwise would undermine the legislative \r\n  mandate that these surcharges be imposed.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court \r\n    in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument \r\n    pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Â  See S.C.

Bacon, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nA. Marvin Quattlebaum, Jr. and Peter G. Siachos, both of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Lyman Campbell brought this action against Laura Caligiuri \r\n  for payment of a real estate sales commission.Â  After a jury returned a verdict \r\n  in favor of Caliguiri, the trial court awarded her attorneyâ€™s fees, pursuant \r\n  to the partiesâ€™ exclusive buyer agency agreement.Â  Campbell appeals.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1] Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn the spring of 2002, Caligiuri contacted Campbell, a realtor, about \r\n  purchasing a home in the Greenville area.Â  Caligiuri was new to the area, having \r\n  accepted a position with Greenville Hospital Systems, which referred her to \r\n  Campbell.Â  On April 12, 2002, Caliguiri and Campbell entered into an â€œexclusive \r\n  buyer agency agreement.â€Â  Two days after entering into the agreement, Caligiuri, \r\n  through Campbell, made an offer on a house.Â  The offer was accepted.Â  Caligiuri \r\n  and the seller entered into a contract for sale on April 14, 2002.Â  \r\nCaligiuri applied for financing from Palmetto Bank.Â  Palmetto Bank \r\n  granted Caliguiri loan approval, contingent upon the liquidation of certain \r\n  assets, including her IRA account, for the down payment and closing costs.Â Â  \r\n  Prior to closing, Caligiuri contacted the loan officer and stated she had decided \r\n  not to liquidate any assets but wanted to pursue an interim loan for the down \r\n  payment and closing costs.Â  The loan officer informed her that the additional \r\n  loan payment would make her loan unapprovable.Â  Caligiuri then withdrew her \r\n  application for financing.Â  The contract for sale of the house expired May 31, \r\n  2002.Â  Caligiuri did not purchase another house in the Greenville area.Â  \r\nAlthough the closing never occurred on the property, Campbell brought \r\n  this action against Caligiuri for breach of contract and bad faith seeking payment \r\n  of a real estate commission, actual and punitive damages, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\n  The case was tried before a jury.Â  The jury returned verdict in favor of Caligiuri.Â  \r\n  The trial court subsequently awarded her $7600.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  This \r\n  appeal followed.Â  \r\nStandard of Review\r\nIn reviewing the denial of motions for directed verdict and JNOV, the evidence \r\n  and the reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom must be viewed in \r\n  the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Brady Dev. Co. v. Town \r\n  of Hilton Head Island, 312 S.C. 73, 78, 439 S.E.2d 266, 269 (1993); Evans \r\n  v. Taylor Made Sandwich Co., 337 S.C. 95, 99, 522 S.E.2d 350, 352 (Ct. App. \r\n  1999).Â  The motion should be denied where the â€œevidence yields more than one \r\n  inference or its inference is in doubt.â€Â  Evans, 337 S.C. at 99, 522 \r\n  S.E.2d at 352.Â  When considering the motion, neither the appellate court nor \r\n  the circuit court has authority to decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts \r\n  in the testimony and evidence.Â  Reiland v. Southland Equip. Serv., Inc., \r\n  330 S.C. 617, 634, 500 S.E.2d 145, 154 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nDiscussion\r\nCampbell argues the trial court erred in not holding that he was \r\n  entitled to his commission as a matter of law.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œAs a general rule, a broker has earned his commission when he procures a purchaser \r\n  who is accepted by the owner of the property and with whom the latter enters \r\n  into a valid and enforceable contract.â€Â  Champion v. Whaley, 280 S.C. \r\n  116, 119, 311 S.E.2d 404, 406 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  However, the broker and principal \r\n  may make the right to the commission contingent upon the occurrence of certain \r\n  events.Â  Hamrick v. Cooper River Lumber Co., 223 S.C. 119, 124, 74 S.E.2d \r\n  575, 577 (1953); Chambers v. Pingree, 351 S.C. 442, 451, 570 S.E.2d 528, \r\n  532 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  A broker suing to recover his commission has the burden \r\n  of proving all the conditions precedent to his right to performance have occurred.Â  \r\n  Chambers, 351 S.C. at 451, 570 S.E.2d 528 at 532.\r\nWe look to the exclusive agency agreement to determine when Campbellâ€™s commission \r\n  is deemed to be earned.Â  In construing a contract, the primary purpose of the \r\n  court is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the parties.Â  Schulmeyer \r\n  v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 353 S.C. 491, 495, 579 S.E.2d 132, \r\n  134 (2003).Â  â€œWhen a contract is unambiguous a court must construe its provisions \r\n  according to the terms the parties used; understood in their plain, ordinary, \r\n  and popular sense.â€Â  Id.Â  A contract is ambiguous when it is capable \r\n  of more than one meaning or when its meaning is unclear.Â  Ellie, Inc. v. \r\n  Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 93, 594 S.E.2d 485, 493 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  In ascertaining \r\n  intent with an ambiguous contract, the court will strive to discover the situation \r\n  of the parties, along with their purposes at the time the contract was entered.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  Any ambiguity in the construction of the agreement must be resolved \r\n  against Campbell, who prepared the agreement.Â  See Hamrick, 223 \r\n  S.C. at 126, 74 S.E.2d at 578.\r\nHere, the exclusive agency agreement provides:\r\n\r\nBuyer understands that commission payable to Broker under Section 4 below shall \r\n  be deemed earned upon Buyer and Seller entering into a binding contract for \r\n  real estate to which this Agreement applies, whether or not Broker was directly \r\n  involved in the transaction leading to such contract.Â  \r\n\r\nThe agreement further provides:\r\n\r\nThe Broker is directed to first seek compensation from the transaction at closing. \r\n  . . .Â  If Buyer elects to acquire such property, Buyer shall pay Broker an amount \r\n  equal to the difference in any fee received by the Buyerâ€™s Broker from the listing \r\n  broker and a total fee of not less than three percent (3%) of the gross price \r\n  of the transaction, or amount equal to the CM code offered by the listing broker, \r\n  whichever is greatest.Â  \r\n\r\nWe find that even if Campbellâ€™s commission was not contingent upon \r\n  closing, it was still not earned until Caligiuri had entered into a binding, \r\n  and thus valid and enforceable, contract for sale.Â  There is no question that \r\n  Caligiuri entered into a valid contract with a seller.Â  See Champion, \r\n  280 S.C. at 122, 311 S.E.2d at 408 (â€œThe fact that no duty of performance can \r\n  arise until the happening of a condition does not make the existence of the \r\n  contract depend upon its happening, unless the parties so intend.â€).Â  Although \r\n  the contract states that it is a binding contract, it also provides:Â  â€œThe obligation \r\n  of Purchaser to purchase is contingent upon the Purchaser obtaining a loan in \r\n  the amount of 90% of the purchase price.â€Â  Thus, the contract only became enforceable \r\n  and thus binding against Caligiuri upon her meeting this contingency.Â  The real \r\n  estate agreement, which provides Campbell earned his commission upon Calguiri \r\n  entering into a binding contract, encompasses the same contingency.Â  \r\nIt is undisputed Caliguiri never received a loan commitment.Â  \r\n  However, as a general rule, one who prevents a condition of a contract cannot \r\n  rely on the other partyâ€™s resulting nonperformance in an action on the contract.Â  \r\n  Champion, 280 S.C. at 120, 311 S.E.2d at 406. \r\n\r\nIt is sufficient for the plaintiff to present evidence that \r\n  the defendantâ€™s prevention â€œsubstantially contributedâ€ to the nonoccurrence \r\n  of the condition.Â  Once he has made such proof, the burden shifts to the defendant.Â  \r\n  If the defendant can show that the condition would not have occurred regardless \r\n  of the prevention, then the prevention did not contribute materially to its \r\n  nonoccurrence and the condition is not excused.\r\n\r\nId., at 122, 311 S.E.2d at 407 (citation omitted).Â  The prevention of \r\n  the condition precedent must be intentional or entail wrongdoing.Â  Chambers, \r\n  351 S.C. at 451, 570 S.E.2d 528 at 532.\r\nWhen Caligiuri applied for financing, she had not sold her house in Florida \r\n  at the time and had initially planned on liquidating her IRA account to fund \r\n  her down payment and closing costs.Â  Palmetto Bank pre-qualified Caligiuri for \r\n  a loan, granting her approval contingent upon her liquidating these assets.Â  \r\n  In liquidating her IRA account, Caligiuri would have incurred penalties and \r\n  fees.Â  Rather than incur these penalties and fees, Caligiuri attempted to acquire \r\n  an additional loan to fund the closing.Â  It was not until the bank rejected \r\n  this attempt that Caligiuri withdrew her loan application.Â  The seller is not \r\n  required to put the brokerâ€™s interests ahead of his own.Â Â  Chambers, \r\n  351 S.C. at 453, 570 S.E.2d 528 at 534.\r\nWe find the evidence supports the conclusion that Caligiuri was not acting \r\n  in bad faith or intentionally trying to deprive Campbell of his fee but was \r\n  merely protecting her own financial interest.Â  \r\nFurthermore, Palmetto Bankâ€™s loan officer testified that even if Caligiuri \r\n  had liquidated her assets, she would not have been approved for the loan because \r\n  her debt ratio was too high.Â  Thus, regardless of Caligiuriâ€™s withdrawal of \r\n  the application, she would not have been able to obtain financing and meet the \r\n  condition precedent.Â  \r\nAs the condition precedent of obtaining financing was not excused or met, the \r\n  contract of sale never became enforceable against Caligiuri.Â  Absent an enforceable, \r\n  and thus binding contract, Campbell was not entitled to a commission.Â  We find \r\n  the trial court did not err in denying Campbellâ€™s motions for directed verdict \r\n  and JNOV.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and

Short, 323 S.C. 522, \r\n  525, 476 S.E.2d 475, 477 (1996).Â  \r\nThe family court based termination of Creelâ€™s parental \r\n  rights, in part, on the fact that the children have been in foster care for \r\n  15 of the last 22 months and have been out of the home for six months and the \r\n  parent has not remedied the conditions which caused their removal.Â  See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(2) &amp; (8) (Supp. 2004).Â  After a thorough review \r\n  of the record we are convinced that termination is in the childrenâ€™s best interests.Â  \r\n  See Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Accordingly, we affirm the family courtâ€™s decision.Â  See \r\n  Dwyer v. Tom Jenkins Realty, Inc., 289 S.C. 118, 120-121, 344 S.E.2d \r\n  886, 888 (Ct. App. 1986) (affirming the circuit court when unchallenged alternative \r\n  findings support the judgment); 5 Am.

Bacot, Jr., of Surfside Beach, for Appellant.\r\nMichael James Barnett, of Myrtle Beach, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Franklin Dean Brown appeals from the trial courtâ€™s order \r\n  granting summary judgment in favor of Sea Mark Tower Property Owners Association \r\n  on Brownâ€™s third-party claim for indemnification of legal expenses.Â  We affirm.1Â  \r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nBrown and his wife Catherine sold Unit 201 in Sea Mark Towers to \r\n  Harry and Carol Ahlfeldt on December 1, 1999.Â  The Association thereafter imposed \r\n  substantial assessments on all of the units for repairs to the common areas.Â  \r\n  The Ahlfeldts sued the Browns for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and other \r\n  causes of action alleging the Browns failed to disclose the severe structural \r\n  defects in the building and the need for the assessments.Â  The Ahlfeldts claimed \r\n  that as Brown had served on the Associationâ€™s Board of Directors from mid-1995 \r\n  to November of 1997, he knew that the repairs were needed and huge assessments \r\n  would become necessary.Â  \r\nBrown brought this third party claim against the Association seeking \r\n  indemnification from the Association for all expenses and liabilities imposed \r\n  upon him as a result of the Ahlfeldtsâ€™ action, including attorneyâ€™s fees, expenses \r\n  and any judgment rendered against him.Â  The Association denied Brownâ€™s claim \r\n  for indemnification and brought a motion for summary judgment.Â  The trial court \r\n  granted the motion.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nStandard of Review\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material \r\n  fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Osborne \r\n  v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).Â  The evidence and all \r\n  reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to \r\n  the non-moving party.Â  Id.Â  â€œIt is well established that summary judgment \r\n  should be granted â€˜. . . in cases in which plain, palpable and indisputable \r\n  facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ.â€™â€Â  Anders v. S.C. Farm \r\n  Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 307 S.C. 371, 373, 415 S.E.2d 406, 407 (Ct. App. 1992) \r\n  (quoting Main v. Corley, 281 S.C. 525, 526, 316 S.E.2d 406, 407 (1984)); \r\n  see Bloom v. Ravoira, 339 S.C. 417, 425, 529 S.E.2d 710, 714 (2000) \r\n  (stating where a verdict is not reasonably possible under the facts presented, \r\n  summary judgment is proper).\r\nDiscussion\r\nBrown argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to \r\n  the Association.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nBrown claims he is entitled to indemnification under the terms of \r\n  the Associationâ€™s Articles of Incorporation.Â  The pertinent section provides:\r\n\r\nEvery Director and every \r\n  officer of the Corporation shall be indemnified by the Corporation against all \r\n  expenses and liabilities, including counsel fees, reasonably incurred by or \r\n  imposed upon him in connection with any proceeding to which he may be a party, \r\n  or in which he may become involved, by reason of his being or having been a \r\n  Director or Officer of the Corporation, whether or not he is a Director or Officer \r\n  at the time such expenses are incurred, except in such cases wherein the Director \r\n  or Officer is adjudged guilty of willful misfeasance or malfeasance in the performance \r\n  of his duties; provided, that in the event of any claim for reimbursement of \r\n  indemnification, the indemnification herein shall only apply if the Board of \r\n  Directors approves such settlement and reimbursement as being in the best interest \r\n  of the Corporation.Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial court held Brown was not entitled to indemnification under this provision \r\n  because Brown was a party to this action â€œâ€˜by reason ofâ€™ his allegedly having \r\n  personally defrauded or otherwise breached some duty he may have owed individually \r\n  to the [Alfeldts] as a seller of his own condominiumâ€ and not â€œâ€˜by reason ofâ€™ \r\n  his having been a director of the Association two years prior to the sale of \r\n  his unit.â€Â  The court explained, â€œIn short, the reason Mr. Brown is being \r\n  sued is that he allegedly failed to fulfill his personal, legal obligation as \r\n  a seller to disclose any knowledge of latent defects to the buyers, regardless \r\n  of how or when he may have obtained such knowledge; the reason he is \r\n  being sued is not because he once served as an Association director.â€ \r\nAs an alternative reason for granting the Association summary judgment, the \r\n  trial court held Brown was not entitled to indemnification because there was \r\n  no evidence that the Associationâ€™s Board had approved any settlement or reimbursement \r\n  for Brown, or that it wrongfully refused to do so.Â  The court found that it \r\n  would not be in the Associationâ€™s best interest for the Board to indemnify any \r\n  director in this type of action.Â  The court elucidated:\r\n\r\nAbsent some special circumstances \r\n  not present in this case, to allow any condominium homeowners association to \r\n  indemnify a director for personal liability he incurs as a result of his alleged \r\n  fraud or other failure to fulfill his personal duties as a seller of his own \r\n  condominium unit would be improper, could result in claims by members of such \r\n  association for breach of fiduciary duty against the directors voting to approve \r\n  such indemnification, and if allowed to stand, could encourage directors to \r\n  sell their own condominium units upon first learning as directors of construction \r\n  defects, without disclosing the same to buyers, in anticipation that they would \r\n  be indemnified by the association (at the expense of all the homeowners) for \r\n  liability to the buyers resulting from such fraudulent activities.Â  \r\n\r\nIn his brief, \r\n  Brown focuses his argument on the trial courtâ€™s first holding that Brown is \r\n  not entitled to indemnification because he is not a party to the action â€œby \r\n  reason ofâ€ his having been a director.Â  He largely ignores the courtâ€™s alternate \r\n  holding that he is not entitled to indemnification because the Board had not \r\n  approved any request for indemnification and such indemnification was not in \r\n  the best interest of the corporation.Â  Brown merely recognizes that the court \r\n  noted this provision in the Articles of Incorporation and states, â€œBrown has \r\n  made a claim unto the corporation by way of his third-party claim, but no evidence \r\n  has been submitted that such a claim has been acted upon by the Board.â€Â  \r\nBrown offers no argument as to how he is entitled to indemnification absent \r\n  the Boardâ€™s approval.Â  He also does not challenge the trial courtâ€™s ruling that \r\n  allowing such indemnification would not be in the Associationâ€™s best interest.Â  \r\n  An appellant has the burden of convincing this court that the trial judge committed \r\n  error in his findings.Â  In re Thames, 344 S.C. 564, 571, 544 S.E.2d 854, \r\n  857 (Ct.App.2001).Â  As Brown failed to meet this burden, we affirm the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Association.Â  \r\n AFFIRMED.Â Â \r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n  1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Staubes, III, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nFreda Saylors and Toby Saylors, pro se Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  James A. Meetze appeals from a circuit court order that \r\n  granted him summary judgment in his action to enforce restrictive covenants \r\n  in a residential neighborhood, but denied his request for attorneyâ€™s fees and \r\n  costs.Â  Meetze argues the circuit court erred in denying his request for attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees and costs because the restrictive covenants provide for an award of both \r\n  to a prevailing party.Â  We reverse in part and remand. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nMeetze filed this action in 2002 against Freda Saylors and Toby Saylors \r\n  to enforce restrictive covenants in the Pirates Cove subdivision of Mount Pleasant, \r\n  South Carolina.Â  Meetze alleged in his complaint that the Saylors were in violation \r\n  of paragraph fourteen of the covenants, which prohibits parking house trailers, \r\n  mobile homes, campers, or other habitable vehicles, as well as commercial vehicles, \r\n  on lots within the subdivision.Â  \r\nMeetze included in his complaint a request for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs as \r\n  provided for by paragraph twenty-two of the covenants, entitled â€œEnforcement \r\n  of Restrictions.â€Â  This paragraph states in relevant part:Â  \r\n\r\nAny owner found by a court of law or equity to be in violation of these covenants \r\n  and restrictions shall pay a reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee to the Plaintiff, together \r\n  with all costs of litigation.Â  \r\n\r\nIn 2003, Meetze moved for summary judgment.Â  The circuit court granted \r\n  Meetzeâ€™s motion and ordered the Saylors to remove any prohibited vehicles parked \r\n  or stored on their lots.Â  The court noted that Meetze had â€œpresented an affidavit \r\n  of reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees and costs in the amount of $1,977.50 for fees[] \r\n  and $161.30 in actual costsâ€ for which he requested recovery pursuant to paragraph \r\n  twenty-two of the restrictive covenants.Â  The court denied the request, however, \r\n  and this appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Meetze contends the circuit court abused its discretion \r\n  in denying his request for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs. [2] Â  We agree.\r\nUnder South Carolina common law, a prevailing party generally has \r\n  no right to recover attorneyâ€™s fees unless they are provided for by contract \r\n  or authorized by statute.Â  Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 486 S.E.2d \r\n  750 (1997); Harris-Jenkins v. Nissan Car Mart, Inc., 348 S.C. 171, 557 \r\n  S.E.2d 708 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nIn this case, there is a contractual basis for an award of attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees.Â  As noted above, paragraph twenty-two of the restrictive covenants expressly \r\n  provides that any owner found in violation of the covenants by a court â€œshall \r\n  pay a reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee to the Plaintiff, together with all costs \r\n  of litigation.â€Â  [Emphasis added.]Â  \r\nIn Prevatte v. Asbury Arms, 302 S.C. 413, 396 S.E.2d 642 (Ct. App. 1990), \r\n  this Court considered a provision of the Landlord-Tenant Act that stated a tenant \r\n  â€œmayâ€ recover â€œreasonable attorneyâ€™s feesâ€ and determined that, to the extent \r\n  the word â€œmayâ€ connoted discretion, it referred to the tenantâ€™s right to elect \r\n  a statutory remedy and it did not mean the trial judge could deny a remedy clearly \r\n  provided for by the statute.Â  Id. at 415, 396 S.E.2d at 643.Â  We concluded \r\n  â€œ[t]he appellate courts of this state have never construed this language as \r\n  giving the trial judge discretion to award or deny attorneyâ€™s fees.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 416, 396 S.E.2d at 644.Â  Rather, although a fee is recoverable as a matter \r\n  of right, the amount must be â€œreasonable,â€ and â€œ[w]hat constitutes a reasonable \r\n  fee is a matter for the court to determine as a matter of informed judicial \r\n  discretion.â€Â  Id.Â  We observed that, in exercising his or her discretion \r\n  in deciding the amount of a reasonable fee, the trial judge should be guided \r\n  by the following factors:Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         the nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (2)&nbsp;\r\n         the time and labor necessarily devoted to the\r\n          case;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (3)\r\n         the professional standing of counsel;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (4)\r\n         the contingency of compensation;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (5)&nbsp;\r\n         the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar services; and\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (6)&nbsp;\r\n         the beneficial results accomplished.Â \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nId. at 416-17, 396 S.E.2d at 644.\r\nAlthough Prevatte dealt with a statutory, rather than a contractual, \r\n  provision for attorneyâ€™s fees, we find it is sufficiently analogous so that \r\n  its reasoning is applicable in the current appeal.Â  Here, the restrictive covenants \r\n  expressly provide that reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees and costs â€œshallâ€ be recoverable \r\n  by a prevailing party in the event a court finds a homeowner in violation of \r\n  the covenants.Â  \r\nDuring the hearing in this matter, when Meetzeâ€™s attorney presented his affidavit \r\n  for attorneyâ€™s fees, the court stated:Â  â€œEven if I rule in your favor, I -- \r\n  you can send it up here but Iâ€™m not going to do it, I am not even going to \r\n  consider your attorneyâ€™s fees even if I rule with you.Â  I think both sides \r\n  have got a legitimate gripe, problem.â€Â  [Emphasis added.]Â  The court thereafter \r\n  encouraged the parties to attempt to negotiate a resolution.Â  When that effort \r\n  failed, the court granted summary judgment to Meetze.Â  The circuit court summarily \r\n  denied the request for fees and costs in its final order.Â  \r\nWe hold the circuit court erred in denying attorneyâ€™s fees and costs to Meetze \r\n  after finding the Saylors were in violation of the covenants and granting summary \r\n  judgment to Meetze on this basis.Â  Since the covenants contractually provide \r\n  a prevailing party with the right to recover attorneyâ€™s fees and costs, the \r\n  court should have determined what constitutes a reasonable fee in light of the \r\n  six guidelines listed above.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the circuit courtâ€™s order \r\n  to the extent it denied Meetzeâ€™s request for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs and remand \r\n  the matter to the circuit court for determination of an appropriate award using \r\n  the factors outlined above.\r\nREVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, \r\n    SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  The Saylors have not filed a Respondentsâ€™ Brief.Â  The South Carolina \r\n    Appellate Court Rules provide that â€œ[u]pon the failure of respondent to timely \r\n    file a brief, the appellate court may take such action as it deems proper.â€Â  \r\n    Rule 208(a)(4), SCACR.Â  Such action may include reversal.Â  Turner v.

Murphy, of Charleston, and John B. Williams, of Moncks Corner, \r\n  for Appellant-Respondent.\r\nPhyllis W. Ewing and Wm. Howell Morrison, both of Charleston, \r\n  for Respondents-Appellants.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This is an appeal of the trial courtâ€™s refusal to award\r\nattorney fees to a landowner in a condemnation action after a jury awarded \r\n  the landowner $21,000 as just compensation for the condemnation.Â  We reverse \r\n  and remand. \r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1999, South Carolina Electric and Gas Company (SCE&amp;G) \r\n  and the Commissioners of Public Works for the City of Charleston (CPW and SCE&amp;G \r\n  hereinafter known as â€œthe Utilitiesâ€) filed a joint condemnation action to install \r\n  utility lines on a thirty foot permanent easement and a fifteen foot temporary \r\n  construction easement on property owned by John Sanders.Â  Sanders did \r\n  not contest the Utilitiesâ€™ right to condemn and the lower court held proceedings \r\n  on the issue of just compensation.Â  Midway through the trial, the Utilities \r\n  amended their pleadings to abandon the temporary construction easement, which \r\n  had no set time limit on its use.Â  Sanders requested $81,000 in damages for \r\n  the value of the actual easements and the construction of an underground pond.Â  \r\n  The Utilities presented an appraiser, who testified that the total value of \r\n  the taking was $7,500.Â  The jury awarded Sanders $21,000 as just compensation.Â  \r\n\r\nSanders then made a motion for attorney fees of $15,101.85 \r\n  for that portion of work done in litigating the just compensation for the temporary \r\n  easement.Â  Though the trial court found the attorney fees to be reasonable, \r\n  it denied this motion because the Utilities prevailed at trial.Â  Sanders now \r\n  appeals the denial of attorney fees, and the Utilities appeal the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  finding that the fees were reasonable.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn an action \r\n  at law tried without a jury, an appellate courtâ€™s scope of review extends only \r\n  to the corrections of errors of law.Â  Okatie River, L.L.C. v. Southeastern \r\n  Site Prep, L.L.C., 353 S.C. 327, 334, 577 S.E.2d 468, 472 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\n  Thus, the factual findings of the trial judge will not be disturbed on appeal \r\n  unless a review of the record discloses that there is no evidence that reasonably \r\n  supports the judgeâ€™s findings, or the findings are controlled by an erroneous \r\n  conception or application of the law.Â  Gordon v. Colonial Ins. Co., 342 \r\n  S.C. 152, 155, 536 S.E.2d 376, 378 (Ct. App. 2000).Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Sandersâ€™ appeal\r\nSanders claims that the trial court erred in denying him \r\n  fees and costs where the Utilities abandoned condemnation by releasing the temporary \r\n  construction easement.Â  We agree.\r\nThe Eminent Domain Procedure Act (the Act), specifically \r\n  section 28-2-510(C), lies at the heart of this action.Â  S. C. Code Ann. Â§ 28-2-510 \r\n  (1991). The Act provides that â€œ[i]f the condemnor abandons or withdraws the \r\n  condemnation action in the manner authorized by this chapter, the condemnee \r\n  is entitled to reasonable attorney fees, litigation expenses, and costs as determined \r\n  by the court.â€Â  Id. The condemnor is not obligated to construct a public \r\n  improvement on condemned property. Â 22 Am. Jur. Trials Â§743 (2004).Â  \r\n  Therefore, it may decide to abandon the condemnation rather than pay the just \r\n  compensation assessed by a jury.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe Utilities concede that they use â€œabandonâ€ as the term \r\n  for their action, but argue they technically released the temporary construction \r\n  easement without ever using the condemned property.Â  They contend that they \r\n  had the right to abandon the temporary construction easement at any time as \r\n  long as they paid the just compensation awarded to Sanders by the jury for the \r\n  condemned land.Â Â  The Utilities also assert that they would have had to abandon \r\n  the entire condemnation before the Act would have given any relief to Sanders.Â  \r\n  We do not read the statute so narrowly.Â  A plain reading of the section indicates \r\n  that the legislature intended to compensate a landowner who incurred monetary \r\n  loss from preparation for litigating a condemnation action, only to have the \r\n  condemnor withdraw at a point prior to disposition, leaving the landowner with \r\n  no avenue to recover expenses.Â  Sanders and his attorney spent time and effort \r\n  planning litigation strategy that contemplated the abandoned easement as a portion \r\n  of the case and but for the statute, this work would be time wasted.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nII.Â  Utilitiesâ€™ Appeal\r\nThe Utilities claim that the trial court erred in determining the attorney \r\n  fees were reasonable.Â  We agree.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe Utilities argue that the requested attorney fees are not reasonable \r\n  because of a lack of evidentiary support, and the trial court did not make specific \r\n  findings of fact on the record as required by Blumberg v. Nealco, Inc., \r\n  310 S.C. 492, 494, 427 S.E.2d 659, 661 (1993). \r\nSix factors should be considered when determining the appropriate \r\n  amount of an award for attorney fees: â€œ(1) nature, extent, and difficulty of \r\n  the legal services rendered; (2) time and labor devoted to the case; (3) professional \r\n  standing of counsel; (4) contingency of compensation; (5) fee customarily charged \r\n  in the locality for similar services; and (6) beneficial results obtained.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 494, 427 S.E.2d at 660.Â  â€œWhere an attorneyâ€™s services and their \r\n  value are determined by the trier of fact, an appeal will not prevail if the \r\n  findings of fact are supported by any competent evidence.â€ Baron Data Sys., \r\n  Inc. v. Loter, 297 S.C. 382, 384, 377 S.E.2d 296, 297 (1989).Â  However, \r\n  â€œ[w]hen an award of attorneyâ€™s fees is requested and authorized by contract \r\n  or statute, the court should make specific findings of fact on the record for \r\n  each factor . . . .â€Â  Blumberg at 494, 427 S.E.2d at 661.Â  If the evidentiary \r\n  support is insufficient as to reasonableness of the amount of the award, the \r\n  appellate court should reverse and remand for the trial court to make specific \r\n  findings of fact.Â  Id.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSanders submitted a memorandum, attorney affidavits, receipts, and \r\n  invoices in support of his motion for attorney fees.Â  However, the trial court \r\n  failed to address specific findings of fact for each factor; it simply found \r\n  the amount â€œto be reasonable.â€Â  Therefore, the trial court erred, and the issue \r\n  is remanded to the trial court to make specific findings of fact.Â  \r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON, STILWELL, and SHORT JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-054","title":"Reliford v.

[1] \r\nFACTSÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nFather and Tamara Thomas (Mother) conceived a child \r\n  out of wedlock, Baby Girl Roe, who was born on June 16, 2001.Â  DSS took Baby \r\n  Girl Roe into protective custody shortly after birth because she tested positive \r\n  for crack cocaine.Â  Mother and Father later testified they used crack cocaine \r\n  together during the pregnancy and Mother testified that Father was addicted \r\n  to drugs and continued to use crack cocaine after the birth.Â  DSS placed Baby \r\n  Girl Roe in emergency foster care on June 22, 2001.Â  At the removal hearing, \r\n  Father agreed to a treatment plan that required him to â€œset and keep an appointment \r\n  to be evaluated for substance abuse by the Alcohol and Drug commission,â€ and \r\n  â€œto submit to a hair strand drug test.â€Â  After the permanency planning hearing, \r\n  the family court ordered Father to attend a drug program.Â  Father failed to \r\n  comply with the treatment plan, and Baby Girl Roe remained in foster care.Â  \r\n\r\nFather was on probation at the time of Baby Girl Roeâ€™s birth; however, Fatherâ€™s \r\n  probation was revoked on September 17, 2001 and he was incarcerated.Â  Although \r\n  the record is somewhat unclear, Father visited Baby Girl Roe on one occasion, \r\n  at most, before his incarceration.Â  While incarcerated, Father tried to arrange \r\n  visits, but DSS refused to allow visitation at the prison.Â  \r\nOn May 21, 2002, John and Jane Doe, Baby Girl Roeâ€™s foster parents, \r\n  filed an action seeking to terminate the parental rights of Father and Mother \r\n  and to adopt Baby Girl Roe.Â  Several days later, DSS filed a notice of permanency \r\n  planning hearing in which it made no recommendation as to its preferred outcome.Â  \r\n  Father answered the Doeâ€™s amended complaint and contested the termination of \r\n  his parental rights.Â  Thereafter, the family court consolidated both actions \r\n  and the case proceeded to trial on March 27, 2003.Â  \r\nBy order dated April 11, 2003, the family court terminated the parental rights \r\n  of Father and accepted the relinquishment of parental rights of Mother.Â  The \r\n  order found several grounds for terminating parental rights.Â  First, Father \r\n  willfully failed to visit or support the child for a period of six months.Â  \r\n  Second, Father had a diagnosable condition, addiction to crack cocaine, which \r\n  made him unable to provide minimally acceptable care for the child.Â  Third, \r\n  Baby Girl Roe had been in foster care for more than fifteen of the last twenty-two \r\n  months.Â  Finally, the court found termination was in the best interests of the \r\n  child.Â  \r\nThe family court noted Father was unable to visit or support because he was \r\n  incarcerated; however, it found he pursued a willful course of lawless conduct \r\n  that resulted in his incarceration and failed to visit or support Baby Girl \r\n  Roe during the three months he was not incarcerated.Â  Additionally, the court \r\n  issued a restraining order against Father, ordering him not to contact or otherwise \r\n  harass Baby Girl Roe, the foster family, Mother, or any DSS employee except \r\n  in carrying out business with DSS and the clerk of courtâ€™s office.Â  \r\nFather filed a motion to reconsider, or in the alternative, to amend the judgment.Â  \r\n  Father contended he was unable to visit or support Baby Girl Roe due to his \r\n  incarceration, and DSS prohibited any visitation after he was incarcerated.Â  \r\n  Father also argued there was insufficient evidence to support the finding he \r\n  had a diagnosable condition.Â  The family court denied the motion.Â  Father appeals.Â Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn a termination of parental rights (TPR) case, this court may review the record \r\n  and make its own findings whether clear and convincing evidence supports termination.Â  \r\n  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, \r\n  519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The appellate court has jurisdiction to \r\n  examine the entire record to determine the facts according to its view of the \r\n  evidence.Â  Richland County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Earles, 330 \r\n  S.C. 24, 32, 496 S.E.2d 864, 868 (1998).Â  However, our broad scope of review \r\n  does not require us to disregard the findings below or ignore the fact the trial \r\n  judge was in a better position to assess the credibility of the witnesses. Dorchester \r\n  County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d \r\n  476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Termination of Parental RightsÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFather argues the family court erred in terminating his parental \r\n  rights.Â  We affirm the termination of parental rights on the grounds Father \r\n  willfully failed to support his child, had a diagnosable condition that made \r\n  him unable to provide minimally acceptable care for his child, and the termination \r\n  was in the best interests of the child.\r\nA.Â  Willful Failure to Support\r\nFather argues the family court lacked clear and convincing evidence \r\nto terminate his parental rights on the ground he willfully failed to support \r\nBaby Girl Roe.Â  We disagree. \r\nSection 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2003) of the South Carolina Code governs \r\n  TPR.Â  Pursuant to that section, parental rights may be terminated upon showing \r\n  one or more enumerated grounds and a finding the termination is in the best \r\n  interests of the child.Â  Under section 20-7-1572(4) parental rights may be terminated \r\n  where: \r\n\r\n(4) The child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period of six \r\n  months, and during that time the parent has willfully failed to support the \r\n  child.Â  Failure to support means that the parent has failed to make a material \r\n  contribution to the childâ€™s care.Â  A material contribution consists of either \r\n  financial contributions according to the parentâ€™s means or contributions of \r\n  food, clothing, shelter, or other necessities for the care of the child according \r\n  to the parentâ€™s means.Â  The court may consider all relevant circumstances in \r\n  determining whether or not the parent has willfully failed to support the child, \r\n  including requests for support by the custodian and the ability of the parent \r\n  to provide support. \r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2003).\r\nThe statute \r\nrequires a finding of willfulness.Â Whether a parentâ€™s failure to visit or support a child is willful \r\n  is a question of intent to be determined by the facts and circumstances of each \r\n  case.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Broome, 307 S.C. \r\n  48, 52, 413 S.E.2d 835, 838 (1992).Â  Our supreme court defined willfulness as \r\n  â€œ[c]onduct of the parent which evinces a settled purpose to forego parental \r\n  duties . . . because it manifests a conscious indifference to the rights of \r\n  the child to receive support and consortium from the parent.â€ Id. at \r\n  53, 413 S.E.2d at 839.Â  Generally, the family court is given wide discretion \r\n  in making this determination. However, the element of willfulness must be established \r\n  by clear and convincing evidence.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. \r\n  Wilson, 344 S.C. 332, 336, 543 S.E.2d 580, 582 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nIncarceration alone is an insufficient basis for termination \r\nof parental rights.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t. of Soc. Servs. v. Ledford, 357 \r\nS.C. 371, 376, 593 S.E.2d 175, 177 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  However, in Hamby v. Hamby, \r\n264 S.C. 614, 216 S.E.2d 536 (1975), our supreme court found that voluntary pursuit \r\nof lawlessness which results in imprisonment and inability to perform parental \r\nduties may evince willfulness.Â  The court also considered the parent-child relationship and lack of contact not only during \r\n  the fatherâ€™s incarceration, but also during the period before his incarceration \r\n  and during the fatherâ€™s short intervening periods of freedom.Â  Id. at \r\n  618, 216 S.E.2d at 538.\r\nFather argues his failure to support Baby Girl Roe was not willful \r\nbecause he was incarcerated and prison policy prevented him from earning income.Â  \r\nHe supports his position by citing Wilson, which held an incarcerated father \r\ndid not willfully fail to support his children simply because he was incarcerated \r\nwhere the father did not otherwise fail in his parental duties to support the \r\nchildren or provide them with a stable home prior to his incarceration. Wilson \r\nat 338, 543 S.E.2d at 583.\r\nThe instant case is clearly distinguishable \r\nfrom Wilson.Â  In this case, Father failed to support Baby Girl Roe during \r\nthe approximate three-month period after her birth prior to his incarceration.Â  \r\nAlthough employed as a truck driver, Fatherâ€™s sole support of Baby Girl Roe since \r\nher birth arose as a result of DSS garnishing $250 from his tax refund.Â  By his \r\nown admission, Father knew a violation of his probation would cause him to return \r\nto jail and he would be unable to visit or support his child.Â  Yet, Father chose \r\nto violate his probation.Â \r\nWe find Fatherâ€™s voluntary pursuit of lawlessness \r\n  and failure to support Baby Girl Roe showed a willful intent to forego support \r\n  of her that falls within the meaning of the statute.Â  \r\nB.Â  Diagnosable Condition \r\nFather argues the family court lacked clear and \r\n  convincing evidence to terminate his parental rights on the ground he had a \r\n  diagnosable condition.Â  We disagree.Â Â  \r\nPursuant to section 20-7-1572(6), the family court may terminate \r\n  parental rights upon showing:\r\n\r\nThe parent has a diagnosable condition unlikely to change \r\n  within a reasonable time including, but not limited to, alcohol or drug addiction, \r\n  mental deficiency, mental illness, or extreme physical incapacity, and the condition \r\n  makes the parent unlikely to provide minimally acceptable care of the child. \r\n  It is presumed that the parentâ€™s condition is unlikely to change within a reasonable \r\n  time upon proof that the parent has been required by the department or the family \r\n  court to participate in a treatment program for alcohol or drug addiction, and \r\n  the parent has failed two or more times to complete the program successfully \r\n  or has refused at two or more separate meetings with the department to participate \r\n  in a treatment program.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2003)\r\nFather testified he used crack cocaine prior to \r\n  the childâ€™s birth and during the time after her birth when he was not incarcerated.Â  \r\n  Mother testified she used crack with Father during her pregnancy and after the \r\n  childâ€™s birth.Â  Furthermore, Father consistently failed to complete his treatment \r\n  plan although ordered to do so, despite the fact that drug programs were available \r\n  to him while incarcerated.Â  Moreover, the record indicates Father had completed \r\n  a drug rehabilitation program prior to the childâ€™s birth but had relapsed.Â  \r\n  In Joiner ex rel. Rivas v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 106, 536 S.E.2d 372, \r\n  374 (2000), our supreme court affirmed the family courtâ€™s ruling that a parentâ€™s \r\n  failure to respond to previous drug rehabilitative efforts meant that her diagnosable \r\n  condition was unlikely to change within a reasonable time.Â  Fatherâ€™s admitted \r\n  drug use, his past failure to become drug free, and his failure to attend a \r\n  drug rehabilitation program despite a court order is clear and convincing evidence \r\n  that Father had a diagnosable condition, unlikely to change in a reasonable \r\n  time, that made him unable to provide minimally acceptable care for the child.Â  \r\n\r\nC.Â  Best Interests\r\nAfter finding one of the grounds for termination exists, section \r\n  20-7-1572 requires a determination that the termination is in the best interest \r\n  of the child.Â  In a termination of parental rights case, the best interests \r\n  of the child is the paramount consideration.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. \r\n  Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 258, 519 S.E.2d 351, 356 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\n  â€œThe interests of the child shall prevail if the childâ€™s interest and the parental \r\n  interest conflicts.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578 (Supp.Â  2003).Â  The stated purpose \r\n  of the TPR statute is as follows:\r\n\r\n[T]o establish procedures for the reasonable and compassionate \r\n  termination of parental rights where children are abused, neglected, or abandoned \r\n  in order to protect the health and welfare of these children and make them eligible \r\n  for adoption by persons who will provide a suitable home environment and the \r\n  love and care necessary for a happy, healthful, and productive life.Â Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1560 (Supp. 2003).\r\nAdditionally, as we reiterated in Parker, â€œthe Supreme Court \r\n  noted: â€˜[p]arental rights do not spring full-blown from the biological connection \r\n  between parent and child.Â  They require relationships more enduring.â€™â€Â  Parker, \r\n  336 S.C. at 259, 519 S.E.2d at 356 (quoting Caban v. Mohammed, 441 U.S. \r\n  380 (1979)).Â  \r\nAn enduring relationship does not exist between Father and Baby Girl \r\n  Roe.Â  Father made no effort to support his child, and he has not seen her since \r\n  shortly after her birth.Â  Father has a history of drug use, criminal behavior, \r\n  and incarceration. [2] Â  Baby Girl Roeâ€™s adoptive parents have a home, \r\n  employment, and no criminal record.Â  Baby Girl Roe has bonded with her adoptive \r\n  parents and they are the only parents she has ever known.Â  Both the Guardian \r\n  ad Litem and DSS caseworker testified termination of parental rights was in \r\n  the childâ€™s best interests.Â  Therefore, we find the termination of parental \r\n  rights to be in Baby Girl Roeâ€™s best interests.\r\nD.Â  Visitation\r\nFather also argues the family court erred in finding he willfully \r\n  failed to visit his child because DSS prevented him from visiting.Â  We agree. \r\n\r\nSection 20-7-1572(3) states:\r\n\r\nThe child has lived outside the home of either parent for \r\n  a period of six months, and during that time the parent has willfully failed \r\n  to visit the child.Â  The court may attach little or no weight to incidental \r\n  visitations, but it must be shown that the parent was not prevented from \r\n  visiting by the party having custody or by court order.Â  The distance of \r\n  the childâ€™s placement from the parentâ€™s home must be taken into consideration \r\n  when determining the ability to visit. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2003) (emphasis added).\r\nThe family court found Father willfully failed \r\n  to visit his child under the totality of the circumstances, because his voluntary \r\n  pursuit of lawless behavior resulted in the incarceration that prevented visitation.Â  \r\n  Although we agree Fatherâ€™s pursuit of lawlessness was willful, we must look \r\n  to the totality of the circumstances pursuant to South Carolina Depâ€™t of \r\n  Soc. Servs. v. Wilson, 344 S.C. 332, 543 S.E.2d 580 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The \r\n  record is somewhat unclear, but clearly indicates Father visited Baby Girl Roe \r\n  in the hospital after her birth and may have visited her on one other occasion \r\n  during the three-month period when he was not incarcerated.Â  DSS prevented Father \r\n  from visiting with his child based solely on his incarceration.Â  Despite Fatherâ€™s \r\n  requests, DSS would not arrange visitation at the prison.Â  Section 20-7-1572(3) \r\n  specifically requires a showing â€œthat the parent was not prevented from visiting \r\n  by the party having custodyâ€ in order to terminate parental rights.Â  Because \r\n  we find DSS prevented visitation between Father and Baby Girl Roe, the statutory \r\n  requirement of section 20-7-1572(3) has not been met.Â  \r\nE.Â  Foster Care Time Period \r\n\r\nFather contends the family court erred in terminating his parental \r\n  rights on the ground Baby Girl Roe had been in foster care for more than fifteen \r\n  of the last twenty-two months.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nSection 20-7-1572(8) allows for termination of \r\n  parental rights when, â€œ[t]he child has been in foster care under the responsibility \r\n  of the State for fifteen of the most recent twenty&#8209;two months.â€Â  S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2003).Â  Application of this statutory section usually \r\n  requires no more than a mathematical calculation.Â  However, in this case the \r\n  child had not been in foster care for fifteen months when the action was filed.Â  \r\n  Therefore, we find termination of Fatherâ€™s parental rights on this ground was \r\n  in error.Â  \r\nII. Restraining Order\r\nFather argues the family court erred in \r\n  granting a restraining order against him.Â  We disagree.\r\nParties who seek a restraining order â€œmust show \r\n  facts and circumstances entitling [them] thereto.â€Â  Odom v. Odom, 248 \r\n  S.C. 144, 147, 149 S.E.2d 353, 355 (1996).Â  The family court ordered Father \r\n  â€œnot to contact, telephone, e-mail, harass, stalk, follow, or observe Plaintiffs, \r\n  the minor child, Defendant Thomas, or DSS employees upon his release from prison, \r\n  except as may be required in carrying on official business with DSS and the \r\n  Clerk of Courtâ€™s office.â€Â  Father argues there was insufficient evidence to \r\n  support the restraining order and that the order was unduly broad because of \r\n  the inclusion of â€œobserve.â€Â  However, the record shows Father knew the identity, \r\n  address, and type of vehicle owned by various parties involved in the case.Â  \r\n  Father is also a felon and habitual drug user.Â  Furthermore, any reviewing court \r\n  will be presumed to read and enforce the restraining order with a degree of \r\n  common sense.Â  In light of these facts, we find no error in granting the restraining \r\n  order.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the termination of parental rights on the grounds Father \r\n  willfully failed to support his child, had a diagnosable condition that made \r\n  him unable to provide minimally acceptable care for his child, and the termination \r\n  was in the best interests of the child.Â  The family court erred in finding Father \r\n  willfully failed to visit his child and by finding the child had been in foster \r\n  care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months.Â  Sufficient facts exist \r\n  to support the restraining order.Â  Section 20-7-1572 only requires a single \r\n  ground to terminate a parentâ€™s rights. \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Father is currently under indictment for murder.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-056","title":"State v.

Callison, Jr., of Greenwood, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. \r\n  McIntosh, Assistant Attorney General Deborah R. J. Shupe, and Assistant Attorney \r\n  General David Spencer, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  A jury committed Floyd Daniel Lipe to the Department of \r\n  Mental Health as a sexually violent predator under the South Carolina Sexually \r\n  Violent Predator Act found in sections 44-48-10 to 170 of the South Carolina \r\n  Code (2002).Â  Lipe appeals, arguing the trial court erred by denying his motions \r\n  for directed verdict and JNOV, and prohibiting him from admitting a prior mental \r\n  evaluation.Â  We affirm. [1]  Â Â \r\n\r\nFACTS \r\nLipe was convicted of four counts of a lewd act upon a minor, two counts of \r\n  criminal sexual conduct with a minor, second degree, and one count of directing, \r\n  performing, and promoting the performance of minors in sexual acts.Â  Lipe was \r\n  released on probation after serving two years in prison.Â  However, he violated \r\n  his probation and, within several months, was re-incarcerated.Â  Lipe was released \r\n  again approximately two years later, but was re-incarcerated for attempted arson.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nSubsequently, the State of South Carolina filed a petition pursuant to the \r\n  South Carolina Sexually Violent Predator Act, seeking to commit Lipe as a sexually \r\n  violent predator.Â  The case was tried before a jury.Â  During cross-examination \r\n  of the Stateâ€™s expert, Lipeâ€™s attorney sought to introduce a mental evaluation \r\n  of Lipe that was completed in 1991 at the request of the court in connection \r\n  with the initial charges brought against him.Â  The evaluation was conducted \r\n  to determine Lipeâ€™s competency to stand trial.Â  The State objected to the \r\n  admission of the report on the basis of relevancy and hearsay, and the judge \r\n  ruled the report was inadmissible.\r\nLipe moved for directed verdict at the close of the Stateâ€™s case, arguing the \r\n  State failed to prove he lacked the ability to control his actions as required \r\n  by Kansas v. Crane, 534 U.S. 407 (2002).Â  However, the judge denied the \r\n  motion.Â  Lipe renewed his motion at the close of all of the evidence and again, \r\n  the judge denied it.Â  The jury determined Lipe is a sexually violent predator \r\n  and commited him to the Department of Mental Health.Â  Lipe moved for judgment \r\n  notwithstanding the verdict on the same basis as his motions for directed verdict.Â  \r\n  The judge denied the motion and Lipe appeals. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Directed Verdict and JNOV Motions\r\nLipe argues the trial judge erred in denying his motions for directed verdict \r\n  and JNOV because the State is required to prove an individual cannot control \r\n  his or her behavior before he or she can be adjudicated a sexually violent predator \r\n  under the South Carolina Sexually Violent Predator Act.Â  Lipe maintains the \r\n  State failed to offer any proof that he had serious difficulty controlling his \r\n  behavior, and therefore, the trial court erred in denying his motions.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\nâ€œWhen reviewing the denial of a motion for directed verdict or JNOV, \r\n  this Court must employ the same standard as the trial court by viewing the evidence \r\n  and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.â€Â  \r\n  Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 299, 536 S.E.2d 408, 418 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\n  The trial court must determine whether a verdict for the opposing party â€œwould \r\n  be reasonably possible under the facts as liberally construed in his favor.â€Â  \r\n  Harvey v. Strickland, 350 S.C. 303, 309, 566 S.E.2d 529, 532 (2002).Â  \r\n  In our review of the trial courtâ€™s ruling, we may reverse only if no evidence \r\n  exists to support that ruling.Â  South Carolina Prop. &amp; Cas. Guar. Assâ€™n \r\n  v. Yensen, 345 S.C. 512, 521, 548 S.E.2d 880, 885 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Sexually Violent Predator Act defines a sexually \r\n  violent predator as a person who: \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         (a)\r\n         has been convicted of a sexually violent offense; and\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         (b)\r\n         suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes \r\n  the person likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a \r\n  secure facility for long-term control, care, and treatment.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(1)(a) and (b) (2002).\r\nIn In re Luckabaugh, 351 S.C. 122, 142, 568 S.E.2d 338, 348 (2002), \r\n  a Sexually Violent Predator Act case, the South Carolina Supreme Court confirmed \r\n  Kansas v. Crane, 534 U.S. 407 (2002), required â€œa court to make a lack \r\n  of control determination before involuntarily committing someone under these \r\n  statutes.â€Â  However, the court found Crane did not clarify how to determine \r\n  â€œwhere control ends and where a lack of control begins.â€Â  Id.Â  Our supreme \r\n  court then held that â€œCrane holds the substantive due process clause \r\n  requires a court to determine an individual suffers from a mental illness which \r\n  makes it seriously difficult, though not impossible, for that person to control \r\n  his dangerous propensities.â€Â  Id. at 143, 568 S.E.2d at 348.Â  The court \r\n  further determined an â€œindividual can only be committed if he suffers from a \r\n  mental illness which he cannot sufficiently control without the structure and \r\n  care provided by a mental health facility, rendering him likely to commit a \r\n  dangerous act.â€Â  Id. at 144, 568 S.E.2d at 349. \r\nIn a comparable case, In re Kennedy, 353 S.C. 394, 578 S.E.2d 27 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2003), we addressed an argument similar to the argument made by Lipe.Â  \r\n  In that case, Kennedy argued the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt \r\n  that he was a sexually violent predator.Â  Id. at 396, 578 S.E.2d at 28.Â  \r\n  The Stateâ€™s expert testified Kennedy suffered from pedophilia, frotteurism, \r\n  and anxiety disorder.Â  Id. at 398, 578 S.E.2d at 28.Â  She noted that \r\n  pedophilia is a lifelong illness and that Kennedy â€œhad the propensity to commit \r\n  future acts on children because of the illness.â€Â Â  Id.Â  Based on these \r\n  findings, we upheld the trial judgeâ€™s determination that Kennedy was a sexually \r\n  violent predator.Â  Id. at 398, 578 S.E.2d at 28-29.Â  In addition, relying \r\n  on Luckabaugh, we found because Kennedy suffered from pedophilia, an \r\n  abnormality critically involving a lack of control, inherent evidence existed \r\n  establishing Kennedy suffered from an inability to control his own behavior.Â  \r\n  Id. at 399-400, 578 S.E.2d at 29.Â  \r\nIn the case at bar, we find evidence to support the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  ruling.Â  As stated in Luckabaugh, the judge was not required to make \r\n  a specific determination that Lipe lacked control, but need only find he suffers \r\n  from a mental illness that makes it difficult for him to control his behavior.Â  \r\n  The Stateâ€™s expert, a forensic psychiatrist, diagnosed Lipe with pedophilia, \r\n  based on his past criminal convictions and tests indicating his continued arousal \r\n  to young girls.Â  The Stateâ€™s expert also diagnosed Lipe as suffering \r\n  from alcoholism, anxiety disorder, and mild mental retardation.Â  Relying on \r\n  these diagnoses, as well as his age, lack of support system, his denial of the \r\n  offenses, past legal troubles, prior relationship history, and his propensity \r\n  to act impulsively, the Stateâ€™s expert determined Lipe has the propensity to \r\n  commit further acts of sexual violence.Â Â  She also determined that Lipe needs \r\n  inpatient treatment.Â  Based on the testimony of the Stateâ€™s expert, the evidence \r\n  established Lipe suffered from a mental illness making him unable to control \r\n  his behavior, and therefore, the trial judge did not err in denying Lipeâ€™s motions \r\n  for directed verdict and JNOV.Â  \r\nII.Â  Admissibility of Prior Evaluation\r\nLipe argues the trial judge erred in prohibiting him from admitting the 1991 \r\n  mental evaluation by Dr. Richard Ellison because the evaluation was relevant \r\n  to show Lipe did not have a mental illness.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial judge \r\n  and â€œwill not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion or the \r\n  commission of a legal error that results in prejudice to the defendant.â€Â  State \r\n  v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 377, 580 S.E.2d 785, 793 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Rule \r\n  401, SCRE, defines relevant evidence as â€œevidence having any tendency to make \r\n  the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the \r\n  action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.â€Â  \r\n  â€œEvidence which is not relevant is not admissible.â€Â  Rule 402, SCRE.&nbsp; \r\n\r\n Section 44-23-410(1) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 1991) states \r\n  a judge can order an examination of a person charged with a crime if the judge \r\n  suspects the person is not fit to stand trial due to lack of â€œcapacity to understand \r\n  the proceedings against him or to assist in his own defense as a result of a \r\n  lack of mental capacity.â€Â  According to section 44-23-410 and the evaluation \r\n  itself, Dr. Ellison conducted the evaluation simply for purposes of determining \r\n  Lipeâ€™s competency to stand trial, not to diagnose Lipeâ€™s mental condition.Â  \r\n  Thus, the evaluation was not relevant to the case at bar.Â  Accordingly, the \r\n  trial judge did not abuse his discretion in determining the evaluation was not \r\n  relevant and therefore, inadmissible.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-058","title":"Johnson v.

Malloy, of Charlotte, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Darrell Johnson and his wife Sheryl (the Johnsons) appeal \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s grant of directed verdict for Fort Mill Chrysler Plymouth \r\n  Dodge regarding claims for breach of contract and violations of both the Motor \r\n  Vehicle Dealers Act and the Unfair Trade Practices Act.Â  We affirm in part, \r\n  reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn March 2000, Darrell Johnson attempted to purchase a Chrysler PT Cruiser \r\n  automobile from Fort Mill Chrysler Plymouth Dodge (Fort Mill Chrysler).Â  The \r\n  dealership was taking deposits from customers for the vehicles, although the \r\n  vehicles had not yet arrived on its lot.Â  \r\nDarrell spoke with Fort Mill Crysler salesman Isaac Byers, who told him he \r\n  could purchase a shale green PT Cruiser that had been originally ordered for \r\n  Morris, a customer who no longer wanted the vehicle. The Johnsons paid a $500 \r\n  deposit to the dealership, indicating on the check it was for the Morris automobile.Â  \r\n  Darrell received a New Car Order or Locate Sheet for a shale green PT Cruiser \r\n  and his name was written next to the Morris order on a vehicle display board \r\n  in the dealership showroom.Â  Byers informed Darrell no other documents could \r\n  be provided because the dealership would lose its allocation from Chrysler, \r\n  but assured him that the car would be available in June or July. [1]   \r\nA few weeks later, Darrell returned to the dealership \r\n  and asked Byers if he could change the color of the car because Sheryl did not \r\n  like the shale green color and did not want the Morris vehicle.Â  Byers informed \r\n  Darrell he could have a taupe PT Cruiser originally ordered for a customer named \r\n  Darmer.Â  Byers removed Darrellâ€™s name from beside Morris on the display board \r\n  and wrote it next to Darmer.Â  No documents were signed regarding the Darmer \r\n  vehicle, but Byers gave Darrell a Darmer vehicle specifications sheet and again \r\n  cited Fort Mill Chryslerâ€™s limited allocation as the reason for not signing \r\n  any documents referencing the transaction.Â  \r\nDarrell checked on the availability of his car periodically and each time Byers \r\n  told him the automobile was in production.Â  In late September when he checked \r\n  on whether the taupe PT Cruiser had arrived, Darrell was unable to speak with \r\n  Byers, who was out of work due to a car accident.Â  Instead, he spoke with a \r\n  new manager, Tim Parker, who told Darrell the dealership had no file showing \r\n  the Johnsonsâ€™ order.Â  The next day, Parker told Darrell the only taupe vehicle \r\n  had been sold to another customer.Â  Subsequently, the dealership found evidence \r\n  of the Johnsonsâ€™ deposit check and refunded the $500 to them on September 27, \r\n  2000.Â  The Johnsons later purchased another PT Cruiser from a different dealership. \r\n\r\nThe Johnsons filed suit against the dealership for \r\n  breach of contract, violation of the Act to Regulate Manufacturers, Distributors, \r\n  and Dealers, and violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act.Â  \r\n  In the complaint, the Johnsons allege breach of the contract to sell them the \r\n  Darmer vehicle.Â  The second and third causes of action incorporate by reference \r\n  the preceding allegations and claim causes of action under the Dealers Act and \r\n  the Unfair Trade Practices Act.Â  The case was tried before a jury and at the \r\n  end of the plaintiffsâ€™ case, the trial court directed a verdict in favor of \r\n  the dealership as to all three causes of action.Â  The Johnsons appeal.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen ruling on a directed verdict, the trial court must view the \r\n  evidence and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom in the light most favorable \r\n  to the nonmoving party.Â  Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. \r\n  416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).Â  If the evidence is susceptible to more \r\n  than one reasonable inference, the case should be submitted to the jury. Heyward \r\n  v. Christmas, 357 S.C. 202, 207, 593 S.E.2d 141, 144 (2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Breach of Contract\r\nThe Johnsons assert the trial court erred in granting the dealershipâ€™s motion \r\n  for directed verdict on the breach of contract claim.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nTo succeed in a breach of contract claim, the Johnsons need to prove the Statute \r\n  of Frauds does not bar their action.Â  A contract for the sale of goods for $500 \r\n  or more will not be enforced unless the parties have made a sufficient writing \r\n  signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought.Â  See S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 36-2-201(1) (2003).Â  A contract may be evidenced by one or more writings \r\n  that â€œare connected either expressly or through internal evidence of the subject \r\n  matter and occasion.â€Â  Young v. Indep. Publâ€™g. Co., 273 S.C. 107, 110, \r\n  254 S.E.2d 681, 683 (1979) (citation omitted).Â  However, when several writings \r\n  must be considered, they must set forth all essential terms such that the contract \r\n  is proved without resort to parol evidence.Â  Id. at 111, 254 S.E.2d at \r\n  683 (citations omitted).Â  Â \r\nTo modify a contract within the Statute of Frauds, the modification must also \r\n  be in writing.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-209(3) (2003).Â Â  Part performance \r\n  by part payment may make the contract enforceable when the contract is divisible.Â  \r\n  See South Carolina Reporterâ€™s Comments, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-201 (2003).Â  \r\n  When the subject matter of the contract is a single object, the contract would \r\n  not be enforceable without full payment.Â  Id.\r\nConsidering together \r\n  all the documents involved in the alleged transaction, no writing exists that \r\n  satisfies the Statute of Frauds.Â  If the Order and Locate Sheet and the deposited \r\n  $500 check form a contract, it is for the Morris vehicle, which the Johnsons \r\n  decided they did not want.Â  Darrellâ€™s request to change the deal to one for \r\n  the Darmer vehicle fails to satisfy the Statute of Fraudsâ€™ requirement for written \r\n  modification.Â  The only writing referencing the Darmer vehicle is not signed \r\n  by an agent of the dealership.Â  In addition, no oral modification would be enforceable \r\n  based on part performance, because the Johnsons did not pay the full purchase \r\n  price for the automobile.Â  \r\nBecause only one reasonable inference can be drawn from the facts, the trial \r\n  court correctly granted the motion for directed verdict to the dealership regarding \r\n  the breach of contract claim. \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Dealers Act\r\nThe Johnsons also assert the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict \r\n  to the dealership on their claim for violation of the Act to Regulate Manufacturers, \r\n  Distributors, and Dealers.Â  We agree. [2] Â  \r\nDamages can be recovered under the Dealers Act if an automobile dealer engages \r\n  â€œin any action which is arbitrary, in bad faith, or unconscionable and which \r\n  causes damage to any of the parties or to the public.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§56-15-40(1) \r\n  (1991);Â  see also, deBondt v. Carlton Motorcars, Inc., \r\n  342 S.C. 254, 263, 536 S.E.2d 399, 404 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Arbitrary acts include \r\n  those that are â€œunreasonable, capricious or nonrational; not done according \r\n  to reason or judgment; depending on will alone.â€ Â Taylor v. Nix, 307 \r\n  S.C. 551, 555, 416 S.E.2d 619, 621 (1992).Â Â  This does not require dealerships \r\n  to interact with customers solely by fixed rules and standards but does require \r\n  â€œsome reasonable basisâ€ for their conduct.Â  Id. at 556, 416 S.E.2d at \r\n  621.Â  Bad faith is â€œ[t]he opposite of good faith, generally implying or involving \r\n  actual or constructive fraud, or a design to deceive or mislead another, or \r\n  a neglect or refusal to [fulfill] some duty or some contractual obligation, \r\n  not prompted by an honest mistake as to oneâ€™s rights or duties, but by some \r\n  interested or sinister motive.â€ deBondt, 342 S.C. at 263, 536 S.E.2d \r\n  at 404 (citations omitted). Generally, unconscionable as it relates to an act \r\n  or transaction means â€œshowing no regard for conscience; affronting the sense \r\n  of justice, decency, or reasonableness.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary (8th \r\n  ed. 2004). Unconscionability has been found in a situation lacking meaningful \r\n  choice due to one-sided contract terms.Â  Fanning v. Fritzâ€™s Pontiac-Cadillac-Buick, \r\n  Inc., 322 S.C. 399, 403, 472 S.E.2d 242, 245 (1996).\r\nViewed in a light most favorable to the Johnsons, the facts raise more than \r\n  one reasonable inference creating a jury question and rendering a directed verdict \r\n  improper.Â  Byers recalled a practice of returning deposit checks to customers \r\n  after selling the vehicles associated with those deposits to other customers. \r\n  Fort Mill Chrysler accepted deposits for vehicles for which it knew it did not \r\n  have a definite inventory.Â  According to Darrellâ€™s testimony, the dealership \r\n  indicated to him that a specific vehicle was being identified for his purchase \r\n  both by changing the name on a specification sheet and on a display board.Â  \r\n  The dealership later claimed to have no record of a transaction with the Johnsons \r\n  and Parker informed Darell that the dealership sold the only taupe vehicle.Â  \r\n  In addition, after accepting the Johnsonsâ€™ $500 deposit, Fort Mill Chrysler \r\n  held the check for six months before returning it to them.Â  Byersâ€™ testimony \r\n  indicates that the dealership had a practice of accepting deposits for vehicles \r\n  not in stock with full knowledge that there would not be enough PT Cruisers \r\n  to satisfy the orders they procured. Â At the very least, a question of fact \r\n  exists as to whether the dealership acted arbitrarily, in bad faith, or unconscionably.Â  \r\n  Therefore, the trial court erred in granting the dealershipâ€™s motion for directed \r\n  verdict on the Dealers Act cause of action.\r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act\r\nThe Johnsons also argue the trial court erred in granting the dealerships motion \r\n  for directed verdict involving their claim for a violation of the Unfair Trade \r\n  Practices Act.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nTo recover under this Act, the plaintiff must prove an â€œascertainable loss \r\n  of money or propertyâ€ because of an unfair or deceptive method, act, or practice.Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 39-5-20, 39-5-140 (1985).Â  The plaintiff must also show the \r\n  actions of the defendant adversely affect the public interest, which can be \r\n  shown by proving the potential for repetition.Â  Daisy Outdoor Adver. Co., \r\n  Inc. v. Abbott, 322 S.C. 489, 493, 473 S.E.2d 47, 49 (1996).Â  \r\nDarrellâ€™s testimony regarding paying a higher price for the PT Cruiser he purchased \r\n  from another dealership could lead a jury to infer that Fort Mill Chryslerâ€™s \r\n  actions caused the Johnsons an ascertainable financial loss referenced by the \r\n  Act.Â  Darrell testified that he paid $23,000 for a PT Cruiser, $3,900 more than \r\n  the price he claims Fort Mill Chrysler quoted to him.Â  There was sufficient \r\n  evidence from which a jury could have found that the dealership accepted deposits \r\n  for vehicles not in stock and delayed the return of the deposits even after \r\n  it became clear that the stock would not meet the demands of those who had given \r\n  deposits.Â  A jury could have found the Johnsons were under the impression that \r\n  their deposit reserved them a specific PT Cruiser. The dealership promising \r\n  more cars than inventory would ever permit seems to have been the common practiceâ€”clearly \r\n  repeated and potentially repeatable. Again viewed in a light most favorable \r\n  to the Johnsons, sufficient evidence exists that indicates the dealership may \r\n  have engaged in practices that were unfair or deceptive based on its dealings \r\n  with them.Â  Therefore, the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict \r\n  as to the Unfair Trade Practices Act claim.\r\nThe trial court \r\n  was correct to grant a directed verdict to the dealership on the breach of contract \r\n  claim.Â  However, questions of fact were created as to the alleged violations \r\n  of both the Dealers Act and the Unfair Trade Practices Act, and those questions \r\n  should have been submitted to the jury.Â  \r\n AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART and REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Due to a successful marketing campaign, Chrysler \r\n    experienced high demand from customers prior to the arrival of the new PT \r\n    Cruiser on dealership lots; therefore, dealerships were allotted only a limited \r\n    number of the vehicles.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  The dealership suggests the causes of action under the Dealers \r\n    Act and the Unfair Trade Practices Act must fail because they are derived \r\n    from the breach of contract claim.Â  Neither the Dealers Act nor the Unfair \r\n    Trade Practices Act contemplates a Statute of Frauds requirement.Â  See \r\n    S.C.

Hendricks, pro se, of Columbia.\r\nHarold W. Funderburk, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Robert M. Hendricks appeals the denial of his application \r\n  for unemployment compensation.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn March 2002, Hendricks began working for Belcher Staffing, Inc., \r\n  a temporary employment agency, performing electrical work at various job sites. \r\n  On May 29, 2002, he left the job to which he had been assigned because he was \r\n  dissatisfied with the compensation that he was receiving.Â  \r\nAbout two weeks later, Hendricks contacted Chester Lee Belcher, the president \r\n  of Belcher Staffing, about additional work.Â  Belcher informed Hendricks that \r\n  there might be work available with Signature Staffing in Charleston and gave \r\n  him the telephone number.Â  Although Belcher also admitted to lending Hendricks \r\n  money for travel expenses to Charleston and receiving reimbursement from Signature \r\n  Staffing for the loan, he denied having anything directly to do with Hendricksâ€™ \r\n  employment with Signature Staffing.Â  \r\nHendricks worked for Signature Staffing for about a week and a half, when he \r\n  was terminated from his assignment because his helper accidentally cut a wire \r\n  too short.Â  He continued to look for work through Belcher Staffing but without \r\n  success.Â  In the summer of 2002, he applied to the Employment Security Commission \r\n  for unemployment compensation.\r\nIn response to Hendricksâ€™ application, Belcher Staffing took the position that \r\n  he was ineligible for benefits because he â€œwalked off the jobâ€ of the most recent \r\n  assignment that Belcher Staffing gave him and had not returned.Â  In addition, \r\n  Hendricks admitted that he did not earn eight times his weekly benefit amount \r\n  from Signature Staffing, making him ineligible for benefits from that employment.Â  \r\n  Hendricks, however, contended that Signature Staffing was either a subsidiary \r\n  or a branch of Belcher Staffing and that his short tenure with Signature Staffing \r\n  was therefore a continuation of his work with Belcher Staffing.Â  \r\nBoth the administrative hearing officer and the Commission found (1) Hendricks \r\n  had not earned sufficient wages from any employer subsequent to his employment \r\n  with Belcher Staffing, and (2) Hendricksâ€™ eligibility for unemployment compensation \r\n  was contingent on the reasons for his separation from Belcher Staffing.Â  Pursuant \r\n  to South Carolina Code section 41-35-120(1), it was determined that Hendricks \r\n  voluntarily quit available work without good cause attributable to the employment \r\n  and was therefore ineligible for benefits.\r\nHendricks filed a petition for judicial review in the Court of Common Pleas \r\n  for Richland County.Â  After a hearing in the matter, the circuit court issued \r\n  an order denying a motion by Hendricks to amend his petition and affirming the \r\n  decision of the Commission.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Hendricks argues his due process rights were violated because the circuit \r\n  court did not allow him to amend his petition in light of evidence that he alleges \r\n  he did not receive until the Commission filed its answer.Â  Similarly, he argues \r\n  he was improperly deprived of the opportunity to review this evidence at the \r\n  appropriate time.Â  The record, however, does not support either of these contentions.\r\nAccording to Hendricksâ€™ brief, the evidence that he claims was withheld from \r\n  him consists of documents filed with the Commission stating Belcher Staffing \r\n  was opposing Hendricksâ€™ application for unemployment benefits because it believed \r\n  Hendricks had walked off the job.Â  The transcript of testimony taken by the \r\n  administrative hearing officer, however, shows that a copy of Belcher Staffingâ€™s \r\n  statements was shown to Hendricks during the hearing.Â  Furthermore, in a document \r\n  filed by Hendricks himself before this hearing, it was clear that Hendricks \r\n  was aware of the position taken by Belcher Staffing regarding his claim. \r\n  [2]   \r\n2.Â  Hendricks next alleges the circuit court erred in ruling on the merits \r\n  of his appeal notwithstanding that the notification he received from the court \r\n  indicated that the hearing was to address his motion to amend.Â  We find no reversible \r\n  error.Â  During the hearing, Hendricks made no objection to inquiries from the \r\n  court that were not directly related to his motion to amend and even advanced \r\n  his own arguments about the merits of the case.Â  Moreover, he never moved to \r\n  alter or amend the appealed order on the ground that it addressed issues beyond \r\n  the motion. [3] \r\n3.Â  Hendricks further contends he was denied due process because \r\n  the administrative hearing was held â€œbehind closed doors instead of a public \r\n  hearing.â€Â  Hendricks, however, made no timely objection on this issue; therefore, \r\n  even if the setting or procedure of the hearing resulted in a deprivation of \r\n  due process, this issue is not preserved for appeal. \r\n  [4] \r\n4.Â  Hendricks next argues that the statutory limitation on fees that \r\n  attorneys can charge claimants in administrative hearings for unemployment benefits [5]  amounted to a denial of his right to counsel \r\n  and a deprivation of his due process rights.Â  The record, however, does not \r\n  reflect that Hendricks made this argument to either the administrative hearing \r\n  officer or to the circuit court; therefore, this issue has not been preserved \r\n  for appeal.\r\n5.Â  Hendricks attempted to ask about a potential job with a subsequent \r\n  employer and the number of job assignments he worked on as an electrician.Â  \r\n  The hearing officer ruled these questions were irrelevant.Â  Hendricks argues \r\n  on appeal that this ruling improperly limited his cross-examination of witnesses.Â  \r\n  We find no abuse of discretion.Â  The central inquiry before the hearing officer \r\n  was the reason for Hendricksâ€™ separation from his last assignment with his employer.Â  \r\n  The number of jobs he had worked on as an electrician or what job referral he \r\n  might have received was not pertinent to this issue.\r\n6.Â  Similarly, Hendricks contends the hearing officer improperly \r\n  limited his cross-examination of Belcher on the issue of whether Belcher Staffing \r\n  and Signature Staffing were the same corporate entity.Â  We find no error.Â  The \r\n  hearing officer permitted Hendricks to present evidence from the Secretary of \r\n  State about how both businesses were licensed.Â  This evidence showed that Belcher \r\n  Staffing and Signature Staffing were separately incorporated as private employment \r\n  agencies.Â  We cannot fault the hearing officer for refusing to entertain additional \r\n  cross-examination from Hendricks on this issue. \r\n  [6] \r\n7.Â  Hendricks next argues that Belcherâ€™s statement that he â€œwalked \r\n  off the jobâ€ was inconsistent with testimony from Belcher during the hearing \r\n  that Hendricks failed to show up for work and asked to be moved.Â  He asserts \r\n  this inconsistency is grounds for reversal.Â  We disagree.Â  The alleged variations \r\n  between Belcherâ€™s statements do not amount to an inconsistency, let alone undermine \r\n  the Commissionâ€™s determination that under South Carolina Code section 42-35-120 \r\n  Hendricks was disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits because he left \r\n  his most recent work without good cause. \r\n  [7] Â  There is substantial evidence in the record to support the Commissionâ€™s \r\n  finding of fact that Hendricks left his assignment with Belcher Staffing because \r\n  he was unhappy with his pay and status on the job.Â  Furthermore, there is no \r\n  evidence suggesting that work was no longer available on this assignment or \r\n  that the terms and conditions of the assignment had changed during Hendricksâ€™ \r\n  tenure with Belcher Staffing.\r\n8.Â  Finally, Hendricks maintains the Commission violated \r\n  his rights by â€œ[c]onsidering unethical business practices as a waiver to State \r\n  law and unemployment provisions.â€Â  In his brief however, Hendricks does not \r\n  address this issue, but instead asserts his work for Signature Staffing was \r\n  really a continuation of his work for Belcher Staffing.Â  The Commission, however, \r\n  found that Signature Staffing was not a subsidiary of or related entity to Belcher \r\n  Staffing, and there is substantial evidence to support this finding.Â  The evidence \r\n  Hendricks presented showed only that Signature Staffing was located in the same \r\n  office space used by Belcher Staffing when the latter entity operated a branch \r\n  in North Charleston and that the incorporators and operators of Signature Staffing \r\n  had previously worked for Belcher Staffing.Â  The Secretary of State was notified \r\n  that, as of February 1, 2002, before Hendricks began working for Belcher Staffing, \r\n  that entity had ceased operating its office in North Charleston.Â  In addition, \r\n  Belcher testified that the two businesses were totally separate entities and \r\n  that he helped Hendricks obtain work with Signature Staffing solely to accommodate \r\n  Hendricks and Signature Staffing.Â  Finally, the documents from the Secretary \r\n  of State confirm that different individuals separately incorporated the two \r\n  entities, that the businesses were separately licensed as employment agencies, \r\n  and that they were not active in the Charleston area at the same time.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Â  Hendricks wrote the following regarding his reason \r\n    for quitting:Â  â€œReason given by my employer was due to me walking off the \r\n    job.Â  I disagree with the reason.Â  I left the job because I was doing the \r\n    work as an electricians and was being pay has a electrician helper.Â  I told \r\n    my employer about this and he did nothing.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n    [3] Â  See Noisette v.

Markley Dennis, Jr., Circuit Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-062\r\nSubmitted December 1, 2004 â€“ Filed January 25, 2005\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAndrew Steven Halio, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nClaron A. Robertson, III, and Paul E. Sperry, both of Charleston, \r\n  for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this declaratory judgment \r\n  action concerning insurance coverage, we are asked to determine the efficacy \r\n  of an exclusion from coverage for â€œloss . . . caused by . . . insectsâ€ in a \r\n  homeownerâ€™s insurance policy.Â  The insuredâ€™s home was damaged as a result of \r\n  honey seeping into the ceilings and walls of their home from a honeybee hive.Â  \r\n  While we recognize the rule of construction requiring clauses of exclusion in \r\n  an insurance policy to be narrowly interpreted, and clauses of inclusion to \r\n  be broadly construed, we findâ€”based on the stipulated factsâ€”that the loss sustained \r\n  by the homeowners was â€œcaused byâ€ insects.Â  We conclude, therefore, that the \r\n  loss is not covered by the policy.Â  In so holding, we reverse the judgment of \r\n  the circuit court. [1] \r\nSTIPULATED FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThe parties entered into a â€œstipulation \r\n  of facts.â€Â  A colony of honeybees nested in the walls and ceiling of Henry and \r\n  Terry Berlinâ€™s home.Â  A hole was cut into the ceiling to ensure that the honeybees \r\n  were exterminated or abandoned the nests.Â  After the bees abandoned the nest \r\n  or were exterminated, the honey contained in the hive began to seep down through \r\n  the walls and ceiling, damaging the home. \r\nThe Berlins notified their homeownerâ€™s \r\n  insurance carrier, South Carolina Farm Bureau, of the damage.Â  Farm Bureau denied \r\n  coverage, specifically pointing to a policy provision that excluded coverage \r\n  for â€œloss . . . caused by . . . birds, vermin, rodents, insects or domestic \r\n  animals.â€Â  \r\nFarm Bureau subsequently brought this \r\n  declaratory judgment action seeking a determination that the damage to the Berlinsâ€™ \r\n  residence was caused by insects and therefore was not a covered loss under the \r\n  policy exclusion.Â  The Berlins counterclaimed for breach of contract.Â  Upon \r\n  consideration of the partiesâ€™ cross motions for summary judgment, the circuit \r\n  court found the language in the policy exclusionâ€”specifically the phrase â€œcaused \r\n  byâ€â€”was ambiguous and construed it against Farm Bureau.Â  The circuit court thus \r\n  found the damage from the dripping honey was not caused by insects under the \r\n  policy language and granted judgment in favor of the Berlins. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAs noted above, the motion for summary judgment \r\n  at issue in this appeal was decided by the circuit court on facts stipulated \r\n  by the parties.Â  After a thorough review of the record, we find no argument \r\n  raised to the circuit court that a question of material fact existed.Â  To the \r\n  contrary, both parties suggested that the dispute was essentially legal in nature, \r\n  and therefore ripe for final disposition at the summary judgment stage.Â  In \r\n  cases with stipulated facts, this courtâ€™s review is limited to â€œwhether the \r\n  trial court properly applied the law to those facts.â€ Kay v. State Farm Mut. \r\n  Auto. Ins. Co., 349 S.C. 446, 448, 562 S.E.2d 676, 678 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting \r\n  WDW Props. v. City of Sumter, 342 S.C. 6, 10, 535 S.E.2d 631, 632 (2000)).Â  \r\n  Were we to now entertain arguments on appeal that a question of fact precluded \r\n  summary judgment, this court would violate the longstanding rule that we only \r\n  address those issues properly raised and argued below.Â  See, e.g., \r\n  Schofield v. Richland County School Dist., 316 S.C. 78, 82, 447 S.E.2d \r\n  189, 191 (1994) (holding that an issue may not be raised for the first time \r\n  on appeal, but must have been raised to the trial judge to be preserved for \r\n  appellate review).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFarm Bureau claims the circuit court erred \r\n  in granting summary judgment in favor of the Berlins.Â  Specifically, Farm Bureau \r\n  argues the policy language excluding coverage for damage caused by insects was \r\n  not ambiguous and that the Berlinsâ€™ losses resulting from the honey seepage \r\n  fell squarely within that coverage exclusion.Â  We agree.\r\nResolution of this coverage question hinges \r\n  on the interpretation of the policy language excluding coverage for â€œloss . \r\n  . . caused by . . .Â  insects.â€ [2] Â  Insurance policies are subject to the general \r\n  rules of contract construction. Fritz-Pontiac-Cadillac-Buick v. Goforth, \r\n  312 S.C. 315, 318, 440 S.E.2d 367, 369 (1994). When the language of an insurance \r\n  contract is free from ambiguity, the words used must be taken and understood \r\n  in their plain, ordinary and popular sense, and such construction is for the \r\n  court. Id.Â  An insurerâ€™s obligation under a policy of insurance is defined \r\n  by the terms of the policy itself, and cannot be enlarged by judicial construction. \r\n  Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Commercial Bank, 325 S.C. 357, 360, 479 S.E.2d \r\n  524, 526 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  It is true that ambiguous or conflicting terms in \r\n  an insurance policy must be construed liberally in favor of the insured and \r\n  strictly against the insurer. Diamond State Ins. Co. v. Homestead Indus., \r\n  Inc., 318 S.C. 231, 236, 456 S.E.2d 912, 915 (1995). Moreover, â€œrules of \r\n  construction require clauses of exclusion to be narrowly interpreted, and clauses \r\n  of inclusion to be broadly construed.â€ McPherson v. Michigan Mut. Ins. Co., \r\n  310 S.C. 316, 319, 426 S.E.2d 770, 771 (1993). Â Â Â However, these rules of construction, \r\n  inuring to the benefit of the insured, do not trump clear and unambiguous policy \r\n  terms.Â  Where the intention of the parties is clear, courts have no authority \r\n  to torture the meaning of policy language to extend coverage that was never \r\n  intended by the parties. Diamond State, 318 S.C. at 236, 456 S.E.2d at \r\n  915.\r\nWe are presented with the narrow question:Â  \r\n  Was the damage to the Berlinsâ€™ home from the honey seeping from the honeybee \r\n  hive â€œcaused byâ€ the honeybees?Â  In light of the stipulated facts, we answer \r\n  the question in the affirmative, for there is indisputably a direct and immediate \r\n  causal relationship between the honeybees and resulting damage from the honeybee \r\n  hive.Â  \r\nThe Berlins argue that the phrase â€œcaused byâ€ in \r\n  an insurance policy inclusion clause warrants a broad and expansive interpretation \r\n  and, conversely, a narrower interpretation in the context of a policy exclusion.Â  \r\n  We agree, but that distinction does not, we believe, justify our rejection of \r\n  the policy exclusion here.Â  See King v. North River Ins. Co., \r\n  278 S.C. 411, 413, 297 S.E.2d 637, 638 (1982) (construing a clause of inclusion \r\n  broadly, noting that â€œit is generally sufficient to prove the event insured \r\n  against was the efficient cause of the loss, even though not the sole \r\n  causeâ€);Â  Stevenson v. Connecticut General Life Ins. Co., 265 S.C. 348, \r\n  349-50, 218 S.E.2d 427, 430 (1975) (construing a clause of inclusion broadly, \r\n  holding that policy language insuring against losses resulting from an accidental \r\n  bodily injury â€œdirectly and independently of all other causesâ€ should be interpreted \r\n  as meaning those losses â€œproximately caused by the accidental bodily injury, \r\n  even though some other cause may have contributed to a minor degreeâ€); Lesley \r\n  v. American Sec. Ins. Co., 261 S.C. 178, 182-83, 199 S.E.2d 82, 84-85 (1973) \r\n  (interpreting a policy inclusion clause insuring losses â€œdirectly and immediately \r\n  resulting from . . . fire and lightningâ€ as meaning losses proximately caused \r\n  by fire and lightningâ€”specifically opining that â€œthe terms â€˜proximate and immediateâ€™ \r\n  are virtually synonymousâ€);Â  7 Lee R. Russ &amp; Thomas F. Segalla, Couch \r\n  on Insurance Â§ 101:40, at 101-127 to 101-129 (3d ed. 1999) (â€œthe rule of \r\n  causation applied in the context of insurance coverage is â€˜proximate causeâ€™â€)Â Â  \r\n  (footnotes omitted).Â Â  This rule of liberal construction in favor of the insured, \r\n  to be sure, requires a different interpretation and application of the same \r\n  causal-relationship phrase when it is part of a clause of exclusion.Â  Where \r\n  we part ways with the Berlinsâ€™ analysis is their conclusion that this rule of \r\n  construction, standing alone, mandates a rejection of the policy exclusion before \r\n  us and a finding of coverage.Â  We adhere to the view that the phrase â€œcaused \r\n  byâ€ in an exclusion clause retains some meaning and efficacy, albeit a narrow \r\n  and restricted meaning.\r\nThe case of McPherson v. Michigan Mutual Insurance \r\n  Co. provides some guidance.Â  In McPherson, our supreme court granted \r\n  certiorari to review a decision of this court.Â  We had held that the City of \r\n  Charlestonâ€™s general liability insurance policy excluded coverage for McPhersonâ€™s \r\n  injuries resulting from a collision with a Charleston police vehicle.Â  McPherson \r\n  v. Michigan Mut. Ins. Co., 306 S.C. 456, 412 S.E.2d 445 (Ct. App. 1991), \r\n  affâ€™d as modified, 310 S.C. 316, 426 S.E.2d 770 (1993).Â  \r\n  The supreme court affirmed in result, but found fault with this courtâ€™s construction \r\n  of the relevant policy exclusion.Â  Recognizing that the phrase in the exclusionary \r\n  clauseâ€”â€œarising out ofâ€â€”is subject to many interpretations, the supreme court \r\n  noted that this court erred when it â€œrelied primarily on cases construing clauses \r\n  of inclusion to interpret the phrase â€˜arising out ofâ€™ in the exclusion provision \r\n  of Charlestonâ€™s general liability policy.â€ McPherson, 310 S.C. at 319, \r\n  426 S.E.2d at 771.Â  The supreme court adopted a construction of the phrase in \r\n  the exclusion provision â€œmost favorable to the insured.â€ Id. at 319-20, \r\n  426 S.E.2d at 771.Â  The court held â€œthat for the purpose of construing an exclusionary \r\n  clause in a general liability policy, â€˜arising out ofâ€™ should be narrowly construed \r\n  as â€˜caused by.â€™ However, we find that even under a narrow construction \r\n  of the exclusion, the injuries . . . are not covered under the policy.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 320, 426 S.E.2d at 771-72 (emphasis added).Â  We similarly conclude that even \r\n  under a narrow construction, the damage to the Berlinsâ€™ home was â€œcaused byâ€ \r\n  the honeybees.\r\nThe stipulated facts lead to the inescapable \r\n  conclusion that the cause of the damage to the Berlinsâ€™ home was the activity \r\n  of the honeybees themselves.Â  Were we required to resort to an attenuated proximate \r\n  cause analysis to link the damage to the Berlinsâ€™ home to the honeybees, the \r\n  rule in McPherson would compel a different result.Â  Here, however, the \r\n  nexus between the honeybees, honey, and damage is immediate and direct.Â  It \r\n  belies common sense and experience to suggest that, merely because the homeowners \r\n  took measures to eliminate an insect infestation, the causal connection to the \r\n  insects themselves is broken such that the natural, consequential effects of \r\n  the insect activity are no longer subject to a standard policy exclusion for \r\n  damage â€œcaused byâ€ insects.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the damage to the Berlinsâ€™ home was caused \r\n  by the honeybees and that Farm Bureau properly relied on the applicable exclusion \r\n  in denying coverage.Â  The judgment of the circuit court is\r\nREVERSED.\r\n HUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n  Â Â Â Â  \r\n    [1] In fairness to the able circuit judge, our holding is grounded on authority \r\n    that was not presented to him.\r\n\r\n \r\n  Â Â Â Â  \r\n    [2] The parties stipulated that â€œ[a] honeybee is an â€˜insectâ€™ under the policy.â€ \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-063","title":"Gentry v.

Gentry, III.Â  We affirm in part, \r\n  reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe parties married in 1985 and \r\n  had one child together.Â  They separated in March 1997.Â  On April 28, 2003, the \r\n  husband commenced this action for a divorce based on a one-year separation, \r\n  sole custody of the minor child, child support, uncovered medical expenses for \r\n  the minor child, a bar on alimony, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  He also filed a notice \r\n  of motion and motion for temporary relief on various issues incident to the \r\n  divorce.Â  The wife was served with these documents by certified mail, return \r\n  receipt requested, on May 16, 2003; however, counsel for the husband admitted \r\n  at the hearing that he could not produce a signed return receipt.Â  \r\nThe temporary hearing was scheduled for June 9, \r\n  2003, twenty-four days after the wife received the pleadings.Â  On June 6, 2003, \r\n  three days before the hearing, counsel for the husband sent the wife by facsimile \r\n  a proposed settlement agreement.Â  The agreement provided the husband would receive \r\n  most of the marital assets, including the marital home, real property in Aiken, \r\n  his vehicle, his retirement, and â€œall assets currently in his name and/or possessionâ€ \r\n  whereas the wife would receive only her vehicle and â€œall assets currently in \r\n  her name and/or possession,â€ as well as visitation with the partiesâ€™ child.Â  \r\n  It further granted the husband sole care, custody, and control of the partiesâ€™ \r\n  child and required him to pay the childâ€™s uncovered medical expenses.Â  Neither \r\n  party would be liable for alimony or responsible for the attorneyâ€™s fees of \r\n  the other party.Â  The wife, who was not represented by counsel at the time, \r\n  signed the agreement at the office of the husbandâ€™s attorney, apparently just \r\n  before the hearing took place.Â  \r\nAt the hearing, the wife, still proceeding without \r\n  counsel, waived her right to object to defects in the service of the summons \r\n  and complaint.Â  She also waived her right to respond to the pleadings and agreed \r\n  to proceed with the final hearing.Â  After questioning the wife about her understanding \r\n  of the agreement and taking testimony from the husband, the family court, ruling \r\n  from the bench, granted the divorce and approved the settlement agreement.Â  \r\n\r\n Three days after the hearing but before \r\n  the filing of the final order, the wife retained counsel and filed an answer \r\n  and counterclaim in which she requested dismissal of the husbandâ€™s complaint, \r\n  an equitable apportionment of the marital assets, and attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  \r\n  These responsive pleadings were filed within thirty days after the wife received \r\n  the summons and complaint.Â  The wifeâ€™s attorney also requested the family court \r\n  to â€œreconsider its findings before signing an order approving the agreement.â€ \r\n  Â The family court, however, after reviewing counselâ€™s request, declined to delay \r\n  the matter, instructed the husbandâ€™s attorney to prepare an order granting the \r\n  divorce and approving the agreement, and advised the wifeâ€™s attorney to file \r\n  appropriate post-trial motions.Â  The final order approving the agreement was \r\n  filed on July 22, 2003.Â  \r\nThe wife, through her attorney, then moved pursuant \r\n  to Rule 52(b), SCRCP, for reconsideration of the final order, noting (1) she \r\n  had only an eighth-grade education and poor reading skills; (2) she had been \r\n  treated over the last six years for depression, anxiety, and stress; and (3) \r\n  she was not provided with the husbandâ€™s financial declaration until she entered \r\n  the courtroom at the commencement of the temporary hearing.Â  She further alleged \r\n  that, because of these circumstances, along with the fact that she did not have \r\n  an attorney at the hearing, she executed the agreement under duress.Â  In support \r\n  of her motion, she submitted two affidavits, one from a vocational consultant \r\n  and the other from a mental health counselor.Â  The vocational consultant attested \r\n  to her tenth-grade reading and comprehension level.Â  The mental health counselor \r\n  recounted her history of depression and other impairments and opined that her \r\n  emotional problems, together with her lack of counsel, caused her to be â€œflooded \r\n  with anxiety and irrational thinkingâ€ when she appeared before the family court.Â  \r\n  The wife also included her own affidavit, in which she alleged she did not receive \r\n  the husbandâ€™s financial declaration until â€œthe middle of the hearing in the \r\n  courtroomâ€ and, until that time, was unaware of both the husbandâ€™s income and \r\n  the property the parties had accumulated during their marriage.Â  She further \r\n  alleged that, although she had reservations during the hearing about the husbandâ€™s \r\n  financial declaration, she felt intimidated by the courtroom setting and was \r\n  afraid to reveal her concerns to the court.\r\nThe family court issued an order denying the motion \r\n  and granting the husband $1,292.29 in attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  The order \r\n  noted these costs were incurred by the husband in defending the motion.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIn the interest of judicial efficiency, \r\n  the courts of this State have consistently encouraged litigants to reach agreements \r\n  on issues arising out of the marital relationship. [1] Â  Before approving an agreement, however, the family court must \r\n  ascertain that both parties have entered into the agreement freely and voluntarily and examine the \r\n  fairness of the agreement under all the circumstances. \r\n  [2]   \r\n1.Â  We disagree with the wifeâ€™s assertion of error \r\n  in the family courtâ€™s determination that she entered into the settlement agreement \r\n  freely and voluntarily.Â  In denying the wifeâ€™s Rule 52(b) motion, the family \r\n  court, after reviewing the transcript of record from the hearing, found the \r\n  wife gave responses indicating that she understood the legal proceedings and \r\n  terms of the agreement, entered into the agreement freely and without coercion, \r\n  and fully understood the consequences of the agreement.Â  After reviewing the \r\n  record, we find no reason to hold otherwise. [3] \r\nIn our view, the affidavits the wife submitted, when \r\n  considered with what transpired at the family court hearing, do not warrant \r\n  a finding that she lacked the capacity to agree to the terms of the settlement. \r\n  [4] Â  In response to the courtâ€™s inquiry as to whether she had entered into \r\n  the agreement freely and voluntarily, the wife answered unequivocally in the \r\n  affirmative.Â  She further acknowledged, without any apparent hesitation, that \r\n  (1) no one had forced her to enter into the agreement against her will; (2) \r\n  both at the time she signed the agreement and at the time of the hearing, she \r\n  was not under the influence of drugs, alcohol, medication, stress, illness, \r\n  or anything else that would have compromised her ability to understand either \r\n  the agreement or the proceedings that were taking place; and (3) she had enough \r\n  time to see an attorney had she desired representation and understood that the \r\n  husbandâ€™s attorney did not represent her.Â  The family court found these responses \r\n  adequate to support its determination that the wife freely and voluntarily entered \r\n  into the settlement agreement, and we see no reason not to defer to this finding. [5] Â  In particular, we note that \r\n  the wife had three days to review the separation agreement outside the presence \r\n  of both the husband and his attorney before she voluntarily went alone to the \r\n  office of the husbandâ€™s attorney to sign the agreement.\r\n2.Â  We agree, however, with the wife that the family court \r\n  should have held a hearing after she timely filed her answer and counterclaim \r\n  to determine if the agreement was fair and reasonable under the circumstances.\r\nWe find instructive the early decision of Drawdy \r\n  v. Drawdy, [6]  wherein the \r\n  supreme court discussed the responsibility of the family court when asked to \r\n  approve a separation agreement:\r\n\r\nWe think it incumbent on the family court, where \r\n  one party seeks to enforce and the other to repudiate a property settlement \r\n  agreement to be incorporated into a subsequent divorce decree, to satisfy itself \r\n  the agreement is a fair contractual end to the partiesâ€™ marital claims.Â  This \r\n  cannot be done without examining the agreement in light of the economic circumstances \r\n  and contributions of each party. \r\n  [7] Â  \r\n\r\nThe divorce decree in this case states the agreement \r\n  is â€œsubstantively fair and reasonable to the parties in light of their testimonyâ€; \r\n  however, it does not explain why the family court found such a disproportionate \r\n  division of marital assets to be equitable.Â  The comments made from the bench \r\n  by the presiding family court judge do little if anything to remedy this lack \r\n  of information, let alone show that the agreement was examined in light of the \r\n  economic circumstances and contributions of both the husband and the wife.Â  \r\n  The wife, then, having timely filed an answer and counterclaim, should have \r\n  been given the opportunity to present testimony on the allegations in her pleadings \r\n  concerning equitable apportionment and attorneyâ€™s fees and costs, particularly \r\n  her claims that she made material and non-material contributions to the acquisition \r\n  of the assets of the marriage.\r\n3.Â  Finally, the wife argues the family court erred \r\n  in awarding the husband attorneyâ€™s fees for defending her post-trial motion.Â  \r\n  In view of the beneficial results she obtained in this appeal, we remand this \r\n  issue to the family court for further consideration.

Madden, of Greenville, for Appellant-Respondent. \r\n\r\nDavid Alan Wilson and Kenneth C. Porter, both of Greenville, \r\n  for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is a cross-appeal from \r\n  a divorce action.Â  William Barry Chisholm, the husband, argues the family court \r\n  erred in: (1) declining to grant him a divorce on the ground of adultery, (2) \r\n  granting custody of the partiesâ€™ minor child to Susan Elaine Chisholm, the wife, \r\n  (3) refusing to expand his visitation rights, (4) ordering him to bear sole \r\n  financial responsibility for the childâ€™s private school expenses, (5) finding \r\n  a portion of an IRA was marital property, and (6) declining his request for \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees and awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to the wife.Â  The wife argues the \r\n  family court erred in awarding the husband sole ownership of the marital home \r\n  and in refusing to increase the marital estate by $10,000.00.Â  We affirm in \r\n  part, reverse in part, and remand. \r\nFACTS\r\nThe parties married in 1979.Â  Both \r\n  were employed and had limited assets, including retirement funds.Â  Before the \r\n  marriage, the husband purchased a home that would become the marital residence.Â  \r\n  Two children were born of the marriage, one of whom was still a minor at the \r\n  time of the final hearing. \r\nIn the spring of 2000, the wife reacquainted \r\n  herself with a male friend from high school.Â  For several months, the wife, \r\n  either directly or through the partiesâ€™ older child, communicated with this \r\n  individual through letters, electronic mail, and telephone.Â  Eventually, the \r\n  two revealed their mutual and long-standing affections for each other and, in \r\n  August 2000, arranged a clandestine meeting at a motel, where they engaged in \r\n  sexual relations with each other.Â  \r\nFor months, the wife concealed her adultery from \r\n  the husband; however, tensions arose in the partiesâ€™ relationship, and she began \r\n  acting erratic and unstable.Â  In October 2000, the wife was admitted to the \r\n  hospital, where she was diagnosed with recurrent major depression and placed \r\n  on medication.Â  After her release from the hospital, the parties resumed living \r\n  together; however, they never really reconciled and tensions escalated.Â  \r\nIn July 2001, the husband filed for divorce on \r\n  the ground of adultery. [1] Â  He also sought custody of the \r\n  partiesâ€™ younger child and equitable apportionment of the marital property.Â  \r\n  In her answer and counterclaim, the wife admitted adultery and sought custody.Â  \r\n  At trial, both parties amended their pleadings to seek a no-fault divorce on \r\n  the ground of a one year separation; however, the husband did not abandon the \r\n  fault ground of adultery.Â  \r\nAfter hearing evidence on the contested \r\n  issues, the family court granted a no-fault divorce.Â  The wife received custody \r\n  of the partiesâ€™ minor child, and the marital property was divided equally between \r\n  the parties.Â  The husband received liberal visitation and was ordered to pay \r\n  child support, including all private school expenses.Â  The family court granted \r\n  the husband a special interest in the marital home and awarded attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  to the wife.Â  Both parties unsuccessfully filed post-trial motions under Rule \r\n  59(e) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, and this appeal followed. \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Husbandâ€™s Appeal\r\n1.Â  The husband argues the family court erred \r\n  in granting a no-fault divorce instead of a divorce on the ground of adultery.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œ[A] divorce is not a prize given in recognition \r\n  of a victory in a contest.â€ [2] Â  Here, assuming without deciding \r\n  that the wifeâ€™s adultery was the immediate cause of the breakup of the marriage, \r\n  the grant of a no-fault divorce did not prejudice the husband.Â  The wife had \r\n  waived her right to seek alimony, and the family court stated it considered \r\n  the wifeâ€™s admitted adultery and found her misconduct did not affect the economic \r\n  condition of the parties. [3] Â  \r\n  Furthermore, although the husband may be correct that the family court was able \r\n  to grant a divorce on the ground of a one-year separation only because docket \r\n  constraints prevented this matter from being heard at an earlier date, we fail \r\n  to see how this circumstance would entitle him to a divorce on a fault ground.Â  \r\n  Finally, the husband does not suggest that spiritual or other considerations \r\n  proscribe him from obtaining a divorce on the ground of a one-year separation.\r\n2.Â  Second, the husband contends the trial court erred \r\n  in failing to award him custody of the partiesâ€™ minor child.Â  We find no reason \r\n  to reverse the family courtâ€™s decision.\r\nâ€œThe welfare of the child and what is in his/her \r\n  best interest is the primary, paramount and controlling consideration of the \r\n  court in all child custody controversies.â€ [4] Â  â€œHowever, where evidence is \r\n  disputed [in a family court matter], the appellate court may adhere to the findings \r\n  of the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses.â€ \r\n  [5] Â  In particular, an appellate court â€œshould be reluctant to substitute \r\n  its own evaluation of the evidence on child custody for that of the trial court.â€ \r\n  [6] Â  Our broad scope of review does not relieve an appellant of the burden \r\n  to convince this court that the family court erred in its factual findings and \r\n  conclusions. [7] \r\nHere, the family court heard extensive testimony \r\n  on the custody issue from the parties, mental health professionals, and the \r\n  guardian ad litem.Â  Mental health professionals testified that, although the \r\n  child would be fine with either parent, the wife had been his primary caregiver.Â  \r\n  We hold the family court properly considered evidence on the strengths and weaknesses \r\n  of each parent and therefore affirm the finding that the childâ€™s best interests \r\n  would be served by placing him in the wifeâ€™s custody.Â  \r\n3.Â  Alternatively, the husband argues that if the \r\n  family courtâ€™s decision regarding custody is affirmed, he is entitled to more \r\n  extensive visitation.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nâ€œ[V]isitation is addressed to the broad discretion \r\n  of the family court.â€ [8] Â  Nevertheless, as with child custody, the welfare \r\n  and best interests of the child are the primary considerations in determining \r\n  visitation. [9] Â  \r\nThe family court initially granted the husband \r\n  visitation in accordance with â€œJudge Brownâ€™s Standard Visitation Order,â€ which \r\n  was attached to and incorporated into the appealed order.Â  After the husband \r\n  moved to alter or amend the judgment, the family court amended the order as \r\n  follows:Â  â€œ[The husband] shall have such additional visitation with the partiesâ€™ \r\n  minor child, as the parties may agree.â€Â  Notwithstanding this revision, we hold \r\n  the evidence indicates the childâ€™s best interests would be served by granting \r\n  the husband specified visitation over and above what he would receive in a standard \r\n  visitation order.Â  The husband had maintained an active role in the childâ€™s \r\n  life.Â  Furthermore, although the wife expressed a desire that the husband have \r\n  liberal visitation with the child, it was evident that the parties did not communicate \r\n  well.Â  We therefore remand the issue of visitation to the family court with \r\n  directions to grant the husband liberal visitation at specified times.\r\n4.Â  We agree with the husband that the \r\n  family court erred in ordering him to bear sole financial responsibility for \r\n  the childâ€™s private school expenses without making an adjustment in his child \r\n  support obligation.Â  \r\nThe husband maintained the child should \r\n  continue to attend private school and testified that he would â€œdo whatever it \r\n  takesâ€ to enable the child to maintain this privilege.Â  The wife, however, did \r\n  not believe that private schooling was necessary.Â  We find it significant that \r\n  the family court agreed with the husband that it was in the childâ€™s best interest \r\n  to remain in private school and that the wife did not appeal this finding.Â  \r\n  Moreover, the record supports this determination.Â  In particular, we note (1) \r\n  the child attended this particular school all his life and was already in high \r\n  school when this case came to trial; and (2) the child had been diagnosed with \r\n  ADHD, making a private school, with its smaller classes and more individualized \r\n  attention, a preferable choice to a public school.\r\nThe child support guidelines require \r\n  the parties to share in the support of a child proportionate to the income earned \r\n  by each of them. [10] Â  In addition, \r\n  the regulations expressly provide that payment of education expenses can be \r\n  a possible reason for deviation from the child support guidelines. \r\n  [11] Â  We therefore reverse the child support decision and remand this matter \r\n  to the family court with instructions either to allocate the private school \r\n  expenses between the parties on a pro rata basis or in the alternative to grant \r\n  the husband a downward adjustment in his support obligation if he is ordered \r\n  to pay more than his pro rata share of these expenses.\r\n5.Â  The husband next argues $35,357 of \r\n  an IRA was nonmarital property and thus improperly included in the marital estate.Â  \r\n  We agree.Â  \r\nProperty acquired by either party prior \r\n  to the marriage is generally nonmarital property. \r\n  [12] Â  In some circumstances, however, nonmarital property may be transmuted \r\n  into marital property if (1) it becomes so commingled with marital property \r\n  as to be untraceable; (2) it is jointly titled; or (3) it is utilized by the \r\n  parties in support of the marriage or in some other manner so as to evidence \r\n  an intent by the parties to make it marital property. [13] Â  â€œTransmutation is a matter of intent to \r\n  be gleaned from the facts of each case, and the spouse claiming transmutation \r\n  must produce objective evidence showing that, during the marriage, the parties \r\n  themselves regarded the property as the common property of the marriage.â€ \r\n  [14] Â  \r\nThe husband testified in detail about \r\n  the retirement assets he owned at the time of the marriage, the manner in which \r\n  they were invested, the records he maintained during the marriage, and the mathematical \r\n  computation of the premarital component of his IRA, with growth on that portion \r\n  during the marriage.Â  Moreover, notwithstanding the commingling and the fact \r\n  that the husband managed the wifeâ€™s retirement funds as well as his own, we \r\n  hold the wife failed to make a prima facie case that the parties \r\n  themselves regarded the funds as the common property of the marriage. \r\n  [15] Â  \r\n Finally, the husband argues the family \r\n  court erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to the wife and in denying attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees to him.Â  In view of the beneficial results obtained by the husband in this \r\n  appeal, we remand this issue to the family court for further consideration. [16] \r\nThe Wifeâ€™s Appeal\r\n1.Â  The wife argues \r\n  the family court erred in awarding the husband sole ownership of the marital \r\n  home after finding the home was transmuted into marital property.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n  Â Â  \r\nâ€œA family court may \r\n  grant a spouse title to the marital home as part of the equitable distribution.â€ \r\n  [17] Â  The family court, in dividing the marital assets, â€œmust give weight \r\n  in such proportion as it finds appropriate to all of the following factors [including] \r\n  the desirability of awarding the family home as part of [the] equitable distribution.â€ \r\n  [18] Â  \r\nOn review, this court \r\n  looks to the fairness of the overall apportionment, and if the end result is \r\n  equitable, the fact that this court might have weighed specific factors differently \r\n  than did the trial court is irrelevant. [19] Â  This court will affirm an \r\n  equitable apportionment if it is apparent that the family court was cognizant \r\n  of the statutory factors. [20] Â  \r\nThe family court found \r\n  the husband had a â€œspecial equityâ€ in the marital residence because he paid \r\n  a $25,000 down payment on the home before the marriage, had funds available \r\n  to pay the full purchase price, and used those funds to pay the debt within \r\n  five years.Â  Although the residence was valued at $295,000, the total equity \r\n  was only $75,500.Â  In addition, the husband assumed sole responsibility for \r\n  all indebtedness under the order.Â  In view of these factors, we hold the decision \r\n  to award ownership of the marital residence to the husband is fair and equitable.\r\n2.Â  The wife also argues the family court \r\n  should have included as a marital asset $10,000 that the husband withdrew from \r\n  a marital account shortly before commencing this litigation.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n  The wife alleges the funds were withdrawn in contemplation of the divorce action; \r\n  however, the husband, although acknowledging that he paid his attorney a retainer \r\n  fee of $10,000, never admitted that the money taken from the account was used \r\n  for this purpose, suggesting instead that it may have been spent on their childâ€™s \r\n  private school tuition.Â  No documentation, such as a cancelled check, was provided \r\n  to enable the family court to determine whether or not the husband had improperly \r\n  liquidated this asset.Â  Having been provided with no plausible explanation as \r\n  to why the wife could not have procured such evidence herself, we are reluctant \r\n  to disturb the family courtâ€™s refusal to find the funds in dispute are part \r\n  of the marital estate.

Buckner, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-072\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2005 â€“ Filed January \r\n  26, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nDarrell T. Johnson, Jr. and Mills Lane Morrison, Jr., both of Hardeeville, for \r\n  Appellant.\r\nBarbara Munig Wessinger, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Carolina Outdoor Development, \r\n  LLC (Carolina Outdoor) appeals the circuit court order affirming the denial \r\n  of three commercial outdoor advertising permits under the South Carolina Highway \r\n  Advertising Control Act (the Act).Â  See S.C. Code Ann. 57-25-110â€“710 \r\n  (Supp. 2004). Carolina Outdoor argues substantial evidence does not support \r\n  the underlying decision, and the court erred in finding no violation of Carolina \r\n  Outdoorâ€™s equal protection rights.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn February 2001, Carolina Outdoor applied to the \r\n  South Carolina Department of Transportation (DOT) for permits needed to erect \r\n  three commercial outdoor advertising signs on unzoned commercial property Carolina \r\n  Outdoor owned in the vicinity of Interstate 26 in Calhoun County.Â  Carolina \r\n  Outdoor claimed it qualified for the permits because its tenant, Matthews Auto \r\n  Service [1] , engaged in commercial activity on the subject \r\n  property.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§57-25-140(A)(8) (Supp. 2004) (Permitting \r\n  certain outdoor advertising signs on unzoned commercial or industrial areas \r\n  along interstate or federal-aid primary highways).Â  DOT denied the permits, \r\n  relying on an exception for businesses engaged in â€œactivities not visible from \r\n  the main traveled way.â€Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§57-25-120(5)(f) (Supp. 2004).Â  \r\n  Specifically, it found that Matthews Auto Serviceâ€™s business activities were \r\n  not â€œvisible from the main traveled wayâ€ except to a partial extent in fall \r\n  and winter months when leaves had fallen from trees located between Matthews \r\n  Auto Service and Interstate 26.\r\nCarolina Outdoor appealed to the South Carolina \r\n  Administrative Law Court (ALC) [2] \r\n  , which conducted a hearing in May 2001.Â  In August 2001, the ALC affirmed \r\n  the DOTâ€™s decision in a written order.Â  Carolina Outdoor then appealed to the \r\n  circuit court, which conducted a hearing and subsequently affirmed the ALCâ€™s \r\n  order.Â  The circuit court denied Carolina Outdoorâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration.Â  \r\n  This appeal followed.\r\nSCOPE OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThis court must affirm an administrative agencyâ€™s \r\n  decision if the decision is supported by substantial evidence and we may not \r\n  substitute our judgment for that of the agency upon questions for which there \r\n  is room for difference of intelligent opinion.â€Â  Smith v. Newberry County \r\n  Tax Assessor, 350 S.C. 572, 577-78, 567 S.E.2d 501, 504 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\n  â€œSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, but evidence which, \r\n  considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the \r\n  conclusion the agency reached.â€Â  Id. at 578, 567 S.E.2d at 504 (quoting \r\n  Grayson v. Carter Rhoad Furniture, 317 S.C. 306, 309, 454 S.E.2d 320, \r\n  321 (1995)).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Visibility \r\nCarolina Outdoor first argues that substantial \r\n  evidence does not exist to support a finding that Matthews Auto Service was \r\n  unqualified to receive commercial outdoor advertising permits because it engaged \r\n  in â€œactivities not visible from the main traveled way.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Act regulates â€œthe erection and maintenance \r\n  of outdoor advertising signs adjacent to the interstate and federal-aid primary \r\n  [highway] systemsâ€ in South Carolina.Â  Daisy Outdoor Adver. Co. v. South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 352 S.C. 113, 117, 572 S.E.2d 462, 464 (Ct. App. \r\n  2002).Â  The Act limits the placement of commercial outdoor advertising signs \r\n  to specific areas, including â€œunzoned commercial areas.â€Â  Id. at 117, \r\n  572 S.E.2d at 465.Â  Business activities that do not qualify property as an unzoned \r\n  commercial area includes â€œactivities not visible from the main traveled way.â€Â  \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§57-25-210(5)(f) (Supp. 2003).Â Â  DOT regulations define \r\n  â€œvisibleâ€ as â€œcapable of being seen, and readily recognized as a sign or commercial \r\n  or industrial activity by a person of normal visual acuity.â€Â  25A S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Regs. 63-342(HH) (Supp. 2004);Â  U.S. Outdoor Advertising, Inc. v. South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 324 S.C. 1, 3, 481 S.E.2d 112, 113 (1997).\r\nHere, Carolina Outdoorâ€™s argument essentially \r\n  hinges on whether Matthews Auto Service was â€œcapable of being seenâ€ from Interstate \r\n  26 and â€œreadily recognized [as a commercial activity] by a person of normal \r\n  visual acuity.â€Â  The ALC concluded that this condition was not sufficiently \r\n  established.Â  It was noted, however, that the location was partially visible \r\n  during the colder months when foliage had fallen from trees located between \r\n  Matthews Auto Service and Interstate 26.Â  It was determined, therefore, that \r\n  Matthews Auto Service was not â€œvisibleâ€ within the meaning of the Act, and thus \r\n  unqualified for the permits Carolina Outdoor sought.Â  We agree for the reasons \r\n  articulated in the ALCâ€™s detailed and well-reasoned order, which we adopt and \r\n  incorporate by reference herein.Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Equal Protection Violation\r\nCarolina Outdoor also argues that denial \r\n  of the permits violated its equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment \r\n  to the United States Constitution because permits were granted to others â€œwhere \r\n  the qualifying business [was] equally or less visible and identifiableâ€ than \r\n  Matthews Auto Service.Â  However, Carolina Outdoor fails to provide any specific \r\n  examples of businesses located on similar sites that were treated differently.Â  \r\n  Thus, we find that Carolina Outdoor failed to meet its burden of proof with \r\n  respect to this issue.Â  See 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 63-349(M) (Supp. \r\n  2004) (â€œThe applicant shall bear the burden of showing that [DOT] should issue \r\n  the permit.â€).\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  The name â€œMatthewsâ€ is spelled differently in many places \r\n    in the record.Â  Because â€œMatthewsâ€ appears in Carolina Outdoorâ€™s permit applications, \r\n    we adopt this spelling.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  At the time, the ALC was named the South Carolina Administrative \r\n    Law Judge Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-073","title":"Puckett v.

Hayes, III, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No.Â  2005-UP-073\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2005 â€“ Filed January \r\n  27, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJames Mixon Griffin, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nCharles S. Bradford, of York, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This is an appeal from a grant \r\n  of summary judgment in a foreclosure action.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1999, William George contracted \r\n  with Larry Puckett to purchase Joeâ€™s Mini-Mall.Â  Both the title to the real \r\n  estate and the closing statement identify the sales price as $1,100,000.Â  George \r\n  made a down payment of $100,000 and signed a promissory note for $1,000,000.Â  \r\n  At the real estate closing, George also executed a separate $150,000 mortgage \r\n  note. [1] Â  In October 2000, Puckett filed an action against George Properties, \r\n  LLC, for the foreclosure of Joeâ€™s Mini-Mall.Â  On June 13, 2001, the court awarded \r\n  Puckett a judgment of $1,064,044.45 and ordered the property be sold at a public \r\n  auction.Â  Puckett purchased the property at the sale for $2,500.Â  George Properties, \r\n  LLC, did not appeal the decree of foreclosure and sale in the action concerning \r\n  Joeâ€™s Mini Mall.Â Â Â  \r\nSeven months prior to \r\n  the filing of that case, Puckett filed an action against George seeking to collect \r\n  on the $150,000 mortgage note.Â  The trial court granted Puckettâ€™s motion for \r\n  summary judgment.Â  George appealed the decision to this court and we affirmed \r\n  the trial court.Â  Puckett v. George, 2002-UP-671 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  When \r\n  Puckett initiated actions to collect on the mortgage note judgment, George filed \r\n  a Rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment, claiming he should get credit \r\n  against the judgment for the amount that the fair market value of the property \r\n  exceeded the foreclosure judgment amount.Â  The trial court denied the motion \r\n  based on its finding that the mortgage note â€œwas not related to a real estate \r\n  transaction, but to the sale of goodwill and other intangible property.â€Â  This \r\n  appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGeorge claims the trial court erred \r\n  in failing to reduce the judgment on the mortgage note by the value of the property \r\n  obtained by the mortgagee in a prior foreclosure action on the promissory note.Â  \r\n  We disagree. \r\nThe $150,000 note signed by George was \r\n  unrelated to the real estate transaction and was clearly a separate debt on \r\n  which Puckett foreclosed.Â  The attorney for the real estate closing of Joeâ€™s \r\n  Mini-Mall testified by affidavit that â€œthe note represented the intangible valueâ€ \r\n  of the property, which included among other things, goodwill and location.Â  \r\n  He further stated, â€œThe exact terms of the note were something that had been \r\n  discussed and agreed to, in [his] presence, several months prior to the actual \r\n  document closing.â€Â  Furthermore, Puckettâ€™s accountantâ€™s affidavit cited the \r\n  total purchase price of Joeâ€™s Mini-Mall as $1,250,000, a combined total price \r\n  of the note for the real estate and the note currently in dispute.Â  In its order \r\n  for summary judgment, the trial court found â€œno reference in the promissory \r\n  note to any real estate transaction.â€Â  Finally, this court affirmed the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment on this same issue.Â  \r\nAny unappealed portion of a judgment is \r\n  the law of the case and must therefore be affirmed.Â  Tolerâ€™s Cove Homeowners \r\n  Assâ€™n, Inc. v. Trident Constr. Co., 355 S.C. 605, 610, 586 S.E.2d 581, 584 \r\n  (2003); Rumpf v. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 386, 398, \r\n  593 S.E.2d 183, 189 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  George did not appeal this courtâ€™s decision; \r\n  he simply tried to make the same argument to the trial court once Puckett attempted \r\n  to enforce the judgment.Â  The trial court and the court of appeals have found \r\n  the notes to be separate and distinct debts.Â  In keeping with Tolerâ€™s Cove \r\n  and Rumpf, these factual and legal conclusions are â€œlaw of the case.â€Â  \r\n  George was not entitled to a reduction of judgment on the mortgage note by the \r\n  value of the property obtained by the mortgagee in the prior foreclosure action \r\n  on the promissory note.Â Â  Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  denial of relief from judgment is\r\n AFFIRMED.  \r\n  [2] \r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Throughout his brief, George refers to the $150,000 note as the mortgage \r\n    note, and the $1,000,000 note as the promissory note.Â  To prevent confusion, \r\n    this opinion will identify the documents in the same manner.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-074","title":"Roberson v.

Nuessle, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-074\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2005 â€“ Filed January \r\n  31, 2005 \r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nVicki Johnson Snelgrove, of Aiken, for Appellant.\r\nChristopher Roberson and Patricia Thomas James, both of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this domestic action, Varanda \r\n  Roberson appeals the family courtâ€™s failure to recognize her relationship with \r\n  Christopher Roberson as a common law marriage.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nVaranda and Christopher Robersonâ€™s relationship began with the pair \r\n  dating in high school.Â  After conceiving a child in 1992, Varanda and Christopher \r\n  moved in together, living in this capacity for approximately ten years interrupted \r\n  only by two periods of separation.Â  During this period of cohabitation, the \r\n  parties had four more children.Â  Sometime during the relationship, Varanda began \r\n  using â€œRobersonâ€ as her surname and Christopherâ€™s family once listed her as \r\n  his spouse in an obituary.Â  School records for the children, who were all named \r\n  â€œRoberson,â€ listed the parties as â€œMr. and Mrs. Roberson.â€ Christopher sent \r\n  flowers addressing her as Varanda Roberson and the two registered for a vacation \r\n  under the name of Roberson.Â  \r\n In January 2003, Christopher left the \r\n  home he shared with Varanda and the children.Â  Varanda brought an action in \r\n  March 2003 seeking custody of the children, child support, alimony, and equitable \r\n  division of the marital assets.Â  After a temporary hearing deciding custody, \r\n  visitation, and child support, the family court bifurcated the issues at trial \r\n  with the intention to hear initially only the common law marriage issue.Â  After \r\n  a trial, the family court found that no common law marriage existed and therefore \r\n  the court lacked authority to divide the property.Â  Varanda appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe issue of common law marriage sounds \r\n  in law. Richland Mem'l Hosp. v. English, 295 S.C. 511, 513, 369 S.E.2d \r\n  395, 396 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  Our review in this case is limited to a determination \r\n  of whether or not there is any evidence to support the findings of the trial \r\n  judge. Weathers v. Bolt, 293 S.C. 486, 488, 361 S.E.2d 773, 774 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1987). Because this action sounds in law, and the existence of a common \r\n  law marriage is a question of fact, this court is bound by the lower courtâ€™s \r\n  factual findings, and its credibility determinations. Barker v. Baker, \r\n  330 S.C. 361, 370, 499 S.E.2d 503, 508 (Ct. App. 1998). We must affirm if any \r\n  evidence supports the lower courtâ€™s findings. Tarnowski v. Lieberman, \r\n  348 S.C. 616, 619, 560 S.E.2d 438, 440 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n Varanda argues that the trial court committed \r\n  error by failing to recognize a common law marriage existed with Christopher.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nSection 20-7-420(5) of the South Carolina \r\n  Code (1985) grants the family court exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine \r\n  the validity of marriages.Â  â€œIn South Carolina, a common-law marriage exists \r\n  if the parties intend to enter into a marriage contract.â€Â  Barker at \r\n  367, 499 S.E.2d at 506.Â  â€œIt is essential to a common law marriage that there \r\n  shall be a mutual agreement between the parties to assume toward each other \r\n  the relation of husband and wife.Â  Cohabitation without such an agreement does \r\n  not constitute marriage.â€Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 235 S.C. 542, 550, 112 \r\n  S.E.2d 647, 651 (1960).Â  â€œA valid common law marriage requires that the facts \r\n  and circumstances show an intention on the part of both parties to enter into \r\n  a marriage contract.â€Â  Owens v. Owens, 320 S.C. 543, 545, 466 S.E.2d \r\n  373, 375 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The party claiming a common law marriage must prove \r\n  it by a preponderance of the evidence.Â  Yarbrough v. Yarbrough, 280 S.C. \r\n  546, 551, 314 S.E.2d 16, 18-19 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  However, direct evidence of \r\n  the partiesâ€™ intent is not often available, thus the existence of a common-law \r\n  marriage is frequently proved by circumstantial evidence.Â  Barker at \r\n  367-368, 499 S.E.2d at 507.Â  Typically, the circumstantial evidence relied upon \r\n  to prove a common-law marriage is the amount of time a couple has lived together \r\n  and whether the couple publicly held themselves out as husband and wife.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  â€œWhile the presumption of marriage from cohabitation and reputation is ordinarily \r\n  a rebuttable presumption, the degree of proof to overcome it is generally very \r\n  high, especially where the parties have cohabitated as husband and wife for \r\n  a long time.â€Â  Owens, 320 S.C. at 546, 466 S.E.2d at 375.Â  â€œThe presumption \r\n  of marriage can be dispelled only by evidence which is â€˜clear, distinct and \r\n  satisfactory.â€™â€ Id. (quoting Jeanes v. Jeanes, 255 S.C. 161, 167, \r\n  177 S.E.2d 537, 540 (1970)).Â  \r\nThe family court determined that Christopher presented \r\n  sufficient evidence that rebutted the presumption of marriage to overcome evidence \r\n  of the coupleâ€™s long period of cohabitation.Â  The court found several facts \r\n  of their behavior important: Christopher neglected to place Varandaâ€™s name on \r\n  the deed or mortgage to a new house he bought, his job health insurance covered \r\n  his children, but not Varanda, and the parties never established joint ownership \r\n  of property or joint assets.Â  The court found and the record supports the notion \r\n  that although Christopher knew Varanda had taken his surname, he was not pleased \r\n  with the fact and even proposed marriage to her on two occasions, evincing his \r\n  belief that the parties were not married.Â  As this is an action at law, we are \r\n  bound by the family courtâ€™s findings of fact unless they are without evidence \r\n  to support them and we find that in the instant case, sufficient evidence exists.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, STILWELL, and SHORT JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-075","title":"Leatherwood v.

Ballard, of West Columbia, for Appellants.\r\nWilliam A. Coates and Carroll H. Roe, Jr., of Greenville, \r\n  for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Denis Oâ€™Connor and BBT Financial \r\n  Services Limited (â€œBBTâ€) appeal from a protective order limiting Appellantsâ€™ \r\n  discovery requests to the time period Leatherwood, Walker, Todd &amp; Mann, \r\n  P.C. (â€œLeatherwoodâ€) represented the Appellants.Â  We dismiss.\r\nFACTS\r\nBBTâ€™s owner, Denis Oâ€™Connor, \r\n  hired Leatherwood to assist in its purchase of a textile mill from Greenwood \r\n  Mills.Â  However, the sale fell through and BBT sued Greenwood Mills in federal \r\n  court.Â  Eventually, the case settled and Leatherwood formally terminated its \r\n  representation of Oâ€™Connor.Â  Later, Leatherwood brought this action to collect \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees from Oâ€™Connor and BBT (Appellants).Â  Appellants counterclaimed \r\n  for conversion, legal malpractice, and breach of fiduciary duty, and brought \r\n  a third party complaint against a specific Leatherwood attorney.Â  Appellantsâ€™ \r\n  claims concern the firmâ€™s connection with a group of investors called Liberty \r\n  Denim who eventually leased the mill from its new owner and received an option \r\n  from the new owner to purchase a separate wastewater treatment facility.Â  This \r\n  appeal follows an order issued by the trial court limiting Appellantsâ€™ discovery \r\n  from third parties to the time period when Leatherwood represented BBT. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nLAW/ ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants claim the trial court erred \r\n  by making factual conclusions that were unrelated and inappropriate to a protection \r\n  motion, thereby quashing subpoenas seeking relevant information without proper \r\n  legal justification and resulting in summary judgment as to Appellantsâ€™ counterclaims \r\n  for malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty.Â  However, an order denying or \r\n  compelling discovery is not directly appealable because it is an intermediate \r\n  or interlocutory decision not appealable before final judgment under section \r\n  14-3-330 of the South Carolina Code (1977).
