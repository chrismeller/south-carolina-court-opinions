Hughston, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-179\r\nSubmitted March 1, 2006 â€“ Filed April 4, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nGeoffrey H. Waggoner, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nGraham Pollock Powell, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Shirley Kirk contends the trial court erred in directing a verdict on all claims including the claims of respondeat superior, breach of implied and express warranties, and negligent hiring.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\n    FACTS\r\n    Shirley Kirk and her daughter are disabled and require assistance with daily activities at home.Â  Mumford, Inc., d/b/a Health Force (Mumford) provides at-home services through Personal Care Aides (PCAs).Â  In 1997, Kirk hired Mumford to provide home health care services on a regular basis.Â  Thereafter, Mumford provided a series of employees to perform a variety of services at Kirkâ€™s home for her and her daughterâ€™s benefit.\r\n    In the spring of 2001, Kirk noticed items of jewelry and other property were missing from her home and called the police.Â  An investigation was conducted but no items were recovered.Â  In April of 2002, Kirk noticed additional items were missing, and shortly thereafter, a Mumford employee, Shirley Caples, confessed to the theft and led police to a pawnshop where some items of property were recovered.Â  Mumford immediately terminated Caplesâ€™ employment. \r\n    Kirk commenced the instant action with an amended complaint filed on August 14, 2003, asserting causes of action for breach of contract and negligent hiring.Â  Linda Sue Gilpatrick, Mumfordâ€™s office manager, testified about how Mumford hired employees to work as PCAs.Â  Gilpatrick testified that typically the PCA seeks employment after reading a newspaper ad.Â  As part of the application process, the prospective employee completes a written application, identifies two references, and is given a competency exam before an interview.Â  Generally, a receptionist reviews the application, checks the references, and administers the competency test.Â  In addition, Mumford relies on the references and background checks to determine the character of the applicant.\r\n    On her application, Caples indicated that she had prior experience at the Coastal Center, but provided few additional details.Â  She also noted that, at the time of her application, she was employed at an elementary school, where she worked in food service.Â  A temporary part-time receptionist, who had been at Mumford only a short period of time, conducted the reference check and confirmed that Caples was a â€œgood workerâ€ at the elementary school.Â  The receptionist did not call the Coastal Center, which Mumford assumed to be her source of prior experience as a PCA. \r\n    As part of the application process, Caples took a written â€œCompetency Evaluationâ€ which required a minimum score of 70 for employment.Â  Caples scored a 76.5.Â  Also included in the application process was the requirement that all potential employees authorize, in writing, a criminal records check.Â  Because of the cost, however, no such checks were actually conducted by Mumford.Â  On her application, Caples denied any criminal convictions. \r\n    At the trial, Kirk called George Vessel, a licensed private investigator, who testified regarding the manner and expense of background checks.Â  He testified that he generally uses a computer to conduct a 10 to 20-year address history search through one of several databases to which he subscribes.Â  Additionally, he does a search for social security numbers and names.Â  He charges a client $25 for such a search; however, he said that anyone with a business license can subscribe to these services and pay $.25 to $5 for a basic search.Â  In November 2003, Vessel conducted a background check on Caples.Â  Using only her name, he learned that she was associated with three social security numbers.Â  He also learned that she had ten addresses in the past twelve years.Â  Vessel found four different name variations and three dates of birth for Caples.Â  He considered these results to be â€œred flagsâ€ and justification for a further search that revealed a felony DUI charge and a sentence of five years probation, in the State of Georgia. \r\n    Prior to the case being submitted to the jury, Mumford moved for a directed verdict on all causes of action.Â  The trial court granted the motion.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n        When ruling on directed verdict or JNOV motions, the trial court must view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Sabb v. S.C. State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).Â  â€œThe trial court must deny the motions when the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œIn reviewing the grant of a directed verdict, the appellate court should not ignore facts unfavorable to the opposing party.â€Â  Collins v. Bisson Moving &amp; Storage, Inc., 332 S.C. 290, 296, 504 S.E.2d 347, 350 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  The court â€œmust determine whether a verdict for the opposing party would be reasonably possible under the facts as liberally construed in his favor.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n          LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n          I.&nbsp; Claim for Respondeat\r\n          Superior\r\n          Kirk contends the trial court erred in directing a verdict on her claim of liability based on respondeat superior because there was uncontroverted evidence that an employee of Mumford, while employed as a PCA, stole jewelry and other items belonging to Kirk. \r\n          The issue of respondeat superior is not raised in Kirkâ€™s amended complaint, nor is it addressed in the trial courtâ€™s order granting a directed verdict.Â  Kirk did not file a motion to reconsider.Â  In order for an issue to be preserved for appellate review, it must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.Â \r\n          Holy Loch Distrib., Inc. v. Hitchcock, 340 S.C. 20, 24, 531 S.E.2d 282, 284 (2000).Â  Therefore, because this issue was not raised at trial, it cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.Â  \r\n          II.Â  Claim for Breach of Expressed and Implied Warranties \r\n          Kirk contends the trial court erred in directing a verdict for her claims of breach of expressed and implied warranties because there was evidence from which the jury could have found Mumford assured Kirk that its employees were trustworthy and would respect her property, and thereafter one of those employees stole items from Kirk.Â  \r\n          In Kirkâ€™s amended complaint, she refers to breach of expressed and implied warranty in terms of a breach of contract issue, and the issues of breach of expressed or implied warranties were not addressed in the trial courtâ€™s order.Â  The issue of a warranty, whether express or implied, was never addressed and Kirk did not file a motion to reconsider.Â  Therefore, this issue has not been preserved for our review.Â  Id.Â  \r\n            Kirk contends the trial court erred by directing a verdict on her claim of liability based on negligent hiring because there was evidence that Mumford assumed a duty to perform background checks and a background check would have prevented the placement of the employee in her home.Â  We disagree.Â III.&nbsp;\r\nClaim Based on Negligent Hiring\r\n              The action of negligent hiring â€œgenerally turn[s] on two fundamental elementsâ€”knowledge of the employer and forseeability of harm to third parties.â€Â  Doe v. ATC, Inc., ___ S.C. ___, 624 S.E.2d 447, 450 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  â€œ[T]hese elements are analyzed in terms of the number and nature of prior acts of wrongdoing by the employee, and the nexus or similarity between the prior acts and the ultimate harm caused.â€Â  Id.Â  A plaintiff must demonstrate that the employer knew the employee had some â€œpropensity, proclivity, or course of conductâ€ for dangerous behavior that was sufficient to put the employer on notice of possible danger to third parties.Â  Id. at ___, 624 S.E.2d at 451.Â  In Doe v. ATC, Inc., ___ S.C. at ___, 624 S.E.2d at 450, we held that a â€œsingle isolated incident of prior misconduct (of which the employer knew or should have known) may support a negligent retention claim, provided the prior misconduct has a sufficient nexus to the ultimate harm.â€Â  \r\n              In this case, Vessel testified that had Mumford performed a background check, it would have discovered that Caples had an alternate name, multiple addresses, multiple social security numbers, and a DUI in Georgia.Â  None of these prior acts has a sufficient nexus to the current crime of theft.Â  Therefore, even if the court had found that Mumford had a duty to conduct an extensive background check[2] as Kirk alleges should have been done, Kirk failed to establish that Mumford would have been put on notice that Caples may commit a theft.Â  Since there is no evidence in the record indicating that Mumford knew or should have known of any propensity of its employee to commit the theft, the evidence is not capable of more than one reasonable inference and the trial court properly directed a verdict in favor of Mumford.Â  \r\n               AFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] â€œAn affirmative legal duty exists only if created by statute, contract, relationship, status, property interest, or some other special circumstance.â€Â  Hendricks v. Clemson Univ., 353 S.C. 449, 456, 578 S.E.2d 711, 714 (2003).Â  There is no statute or common law precedent in South Carolina that requires employers to conduct background checks on employees and Kirk did not present any evidence to establish a standard of care.Â  Mumfordâ€™s act of checking one of Caplesâ€™ employee references does not create an affirmative duty that requires Mumford to conduct a further background investigation.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-180","title":"In the Matter of the Care and Treatment of James Bennington","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayUnPubOpinion.cfm?caseNo=2006-UP-180","description":null,"date":"2006-04-04","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS OPINION HAS NO PRECEDENTIAL VALUE.Â  IT SHOULD NOT BE CITED OR RELIED ON AS&nbsp;\r\n PRECEDENT IN ANY PROCEEDING EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY RULE 239(d)(2), SCACR.\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Matter of the Care and Treatment of James Bennington,\r\nAppellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Lexington County\r\nÂ William P. Keesley, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-180\r\nHeard March 7, 2006 â€“ Filed April 4, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nTara Shurling, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Attorney General Deborah R.J. Shupe, and Assistant Attorney General R. Westmoreland Clarkson, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp;\r\nBennington appeals from an order denying his release from the Department of Mental Health (the Department), arguing that the trial court erred by applying the wrong standard in its determination that no probable cause existed to believe that Benningtonâ€™s mental abnormality or personality disorder had so changed that he was safe to be at large and that he was not likely to commit acts of sexual violence.Â  We affirm.\r\n    FACTS\r\n    In 1989, Bennington was convicted of three counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor for taking nude photographs of three different adolescent girls.Â  In 1991, Bennington was convicted of one count of criminal sexual conduct with a minor and one count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor involving a 13-year-old girl.Â  On September 6, 2000, Bennington was found to be a sexually violent predator pursuant to Section 44-48-100 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) and was committed to the custody of the Department until such a time as his condition had so changed that it is safe for him to be at large.Â  On July 30, 2003, Bennington petitioned the court for release.Â  After being rescheduled twice, a hearing was held on March 2, 2004 to determine if there was probable cause to have an annual review trial.Â  On March 2, 2004, the trial judge issued his order denying Benningtonâ€™s request for a trial, after finding that there was not probable cause to believe that Benningtonâ€™s mental abnormality or personality disorder had so changed that he was safe to be at large and, if released, unlikely to commit acts of sexual violence.[1]Â  This appeal follows.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n      LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n      Bennington argues the trial court erred by applying the wrong standard in its determination that no probable cause existed to believe that Benningtonâ€™s mental abnormality or personality disorder had so changed that he was safe to be at large, and, if released, was not likely to commit acts of sexual violence.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n      Section 44-48-110 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) mandates that a person committed under the Sexually Violent Predator Act (the Act), S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-10 to 170 (Supp. 2005), must have an annual examination of his mental condition and the court must conduct an annual hearing to review the committed personâ€™s status.Â  A committed person may petition the court for release from the Department at the annual hearing.Â  At the hearing to determine whether the results of a statutory annual review warrant a trial to determine if a committed person should be released from confinement, the trial court uses a probable cause standard: \r\n\r\n      If the court determines that probable cause exists to believe that the personâ€™s mental abnormality or personality disorder has so changed that the person is safe to be at large and, if released, is not likely to commit acts of sexual violence, the court shall schedule a trial on the issue.\r\n\r\n      S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-110 (Supp. 2005); In the Matter of the Care &amp; Treatment of Corley, 365 S.C. 252, 255, 616 S.E.2d 441, 442 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  In South Carolina, the committed person bears the â€œburden of showing the hearing court that probable cause exists to believe that his mental health condition has so changed that he is safe to be released.â€Â  In the Matter of the Care &amp; Treatment of Tucker, 353 S.C. 466, 470, 578 S.E.2d 719, 721 (2003).Â  â€œOn review, the appellate court will not disturb the hearing courtâ€™s finding on probable cause unless found to be without evidence that reasonably supports the hearing courtâ€™s finding.â€Â  Id. at 470, 578 S.E.2d 719 at 722; See also Corley, 365 S.C. at 257, 616 S.E.2d at 444.\r\n      The Kansas Supreme Court noted the probable cause hearing required by its Sexually Violent Predator Act, after which the South Carolina Act is modeled, is akin to a preliminary hearing in a criminal matter and, therefore, found relevant the standard applicable in criminal proceedings.Â  In the Matter of the Care and Treatment of Foster, 127 P.3d 277, 284 (Kan. 2006).Â  Additionally, the Supreme Court of Washington, in discussing its sexually violent predator act and the application of the probable cause standard, stated that the issuance of a search warrant and a warrantless arrest are the most common examples of the probable cause determination.Â  In re Detention of Petersen, 42 P.3d 952, 957 (Wash. 2002).Â  In those determinations, the court must determine â€œwhether the facts (or absence thereof)â€”if believedâ€”warrant more proceedings.â€Â  Id. (emphasis in original); see also In re Jones, 264 S.C. 286, 288, 214 S.E.2d 816, 816 (1975) (â€œâ€˜The substance of all the definitions (of probable cause) is a reasonable ground for belief of guilt[].â€™â€); Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 977 (Abridged 7th ed. 2000) (stating that probable cause amounts to more than a bare suspicion but less than evidence that would justify a conviction).\r\n      Bennington claims the issue of the appropriate standard to be applied at a probable cause hearing is an issue of first impression in South Carolina.Â  Bennington further alleges that the trial judge should not weigh the evidence presented at the hearing, but should limit its determination to the existence or non-existence of probable cause.Â  Although our courts have not explicitly stated a standard for these types of hearings, it is clear from both In the Matter of the Care &amp; Treatment of Tucker and In the Matter of the Care &amp; Treatment of Corley that the trial court is supposed to test the sufficiency of the evidence in making its determination.Â  In Tucker, our supreme court found that the evidence reasonably supported the trial judgeâ€™s finding of no probable cause even though there was evidence that Tucker could have been released to long-term outpatient care.Â  Tucker, 353 S.C. at 471, 578 S.E.2d 719 at 722; See also Corley, 365 S.C. at 257-258, 616 S.E.2d 441, 444 (finding that the evidence reasonably supported the trial judgeâ€™s finding of no probable cause because there was evidence that Corley would need outpatient treatment if released and the Act does not provide for court-ordered outpatient treatment).Â  \r\n      In this case, Bennington presented evidence that he had made progress in his treatment and could be released to outpatient treatment.Â  However, Bennington testified that after his release he planned on traveling across the country to try to locate his son in California and that he would find treatment if he needed it.Â  Dr. Lanette Atkins testified for the State that she was concerned about Benningtonâ€™s plans to take a month off from therapy and travel because the initial adjustment to the community is stressful and â€œto think about taking a trip across the country, itâ€™s not realistic to think that you can go to a new city, and walk into a mental health center, and see somebody, and be treated as a sexual offender.â€Â  Additionally, Atkins testified that Bennington is diagnosed with pedophilia and he has declined medication because he told her â€œhe sees no need for medication to control any sexual urges.â€Â  In his order, the judge stated that Bennington was â€œtrying to establish his own rules on some critical aspects of his treatment that are not realistic and are likely to encourage re-offending.â€Â  He further found that â€œ[t]his mindset is completely unacceptable and demonstrates a lack of insight that is dangerous.â€Â  Atkins concluded that she did not â€œsee evidence of sufficient change to say that [Bennington] is not likely to commit acts of sexual violence.â€Â  The trial judge found Atkinsâ€™ testimony to be â€œextremely credible.â€Â  Therefore, we find the evidence reasonably supports the trial judgeâ€™s finding of no probable cause to have an annual review trial.Â  \r\n      AFFIRMED. \r\n      BEATTY, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Subsequent to this appeal, Bennington was released from the Department on March 10, 2005.Â  â€œA case becomes moot when judgment, if rendered, will have no practical legal effect upon [the] existing controversy.Â  This is true when some event occurs making it impossible for [the] reviewing Court to grant effectual relief.â€Â  Mathis v. South Carolina State Highway Depâ€™t, 260 S.C. 344, 346, 195 S.E.2d 713, 715 (1973).Â  However, â€œ[a]n appellate court can take jurisdiction, despite mootness, if the issue raised is capable of repetition but evading review.â€Â  Because a person who is committed pursuant to the Act is entitled to an annual review of his status, or may be released at any time upon the petition of the Director of the Department, â€œ[t]here exists the very real possibility, then, that many SVP appellants will be released before their appeals can be concluded.â€Â \r\nIn re McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 90, 551 S.E.2d 235, 237 (2001).Â  Therefore, although Benningtonâ€™s case is moot, this court has jurisdiction to hear Benningtonâ€™s appeal because it is capable of repetition but evading review.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-181","title":"State v.

Lloyd, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-194\r\nHeard March 8, 2006 â€“ Filed April 12, 2006Â Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Acting Chief Attorney Joseph L. Savitz, III, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General David A. Spencer, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Barbara R. Morgan, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Edward Johnson, Jr. appeals the trial judgeâ€™s decision to sentence him to ten yearsâ€™ incarceration for escape.Â  Specifically, Johnson argues the trial judge erred by making inappropriate comments during sentencing.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nJohnson escaped from prison in January 2002.Â  At the time of his escape, Johnson was serving a seven-year sentence for resisting arrest and was within months of being released.Â  Johnson ultimately pled guilty to the escape. \r\nAfter the plea, the trial judge inquired about the circumstances of Johnsonâ€™s resisting arrest charge.Â  After conflicting accounts from Johnson and the solicitor, the trial judge addressed Johnson:\r\n\r\n  Court: Isnâ€™t it enough to go through and put you away one time, then theyâ€™ve got to have the expense of doing a manhunt for you, and then tracking you down, and bringing you all the way back up here?Â  Isnâ€™t one time enough?\r\n  Johnson: Yes, Sir.Â  I was just on a lot of stress.\r\n  Court: Youâ€™re old enough to know better than that.\r\n  Johnson: True indeed.Â  I ainâ€™t mean no harm by it.\r\n  Court: Iâ€™m in the Department of Corrections, and Iâ€™ll just check myself in and out when I get readyâ€”sounds like a good idea to you.\r\n  Johnson: No, Sir.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge then continued:\r\n\r\n  Court: Iâ€™m going to give you a guess how much you got.Â  Itâ€™s not a year.Â  Itâ€™s not fifteen.\r\n  Johnson: Two?\r\n  Court: Iâ€™ll give you three guesses.\r\n  Johnson: Five?\r\n  Court: One more.\r\n  Johnson: Three?\r\n  Court: Ten\r\n  . . . . \r\n  Court: Hereâ€™s the problem Iâ€™ve got, Son.Â  Youâ€™re a violent felon when you walked out of there.Â  Itâ€™s not like you had committed forgery or anything like that.Â  Do you know how much money it probably cost them to do a search around that prison and all?\r\n  . . . .\r\n  Court: The taxpayers have lost that.Â  Not only that, but then law enforcement all over go into action looking for a convicted, violent felon whoâ€™s left the Department of Corrections, left a prison.Â  Theyâ€™re all out on the street looking for you.Â  Not only that, Sir, youâ€™re not just a violent felon, but youâ€™re a violent felon who attacked a police officerâ€”several police officers.Â  So everybody is running around all over the place looking for you.Â  How much of that money are we going to get back?\r\n  . . . .\r\n  Court: For the State of South Carolina?Â  Not a lot.Â  Not to make a dent in the cost, so Iâ€™m going to have to collect it another way.Â  You should have stayed there.\r\n\r\nJohnson made no contemporaneous objection to the comments of the trial judge at the hearing, and he did not file a motion for reconsideration of the ten-year sentence.Â  Johnson did, however, file this appeal.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only and is bound by factual findings of the trial judge unless clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827,Â  829 (2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nJohnson argues the trial judge erred by making highly inappropriate comments during sentencing, and as a result, his sentence should be reversed.Â  We find this issue not properly preserved for our review.[1] \r\nThe general rule of issue preservation states that if an issue was not raised and ruled upon below, it will not be considered for the first time on appeal.Â  State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693 (2003); State v. Passmore, 363 S.C. 568, 584, 611 S.E.2d 273, 281 (Ct. App. 2005). Our courts have â€œconsistently refused to apply the plain error rule.â€Â  Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 306, 486 S.E.2d 750, 759 (1997) (citations omitted).Â  Instead, we have held â€œit is the responsibility of counsel to preserve issues for appellate review.â€Â  Id.Â  Moreover, on numerous occasions our supreme court has held that a challenge to sentencing must be raised at trial to preserve the issue for appellate review.Â  State v. Johnston, 333 S.C. 459, 462, 510 S.E.2d 423, 425 (1999); see also State v. Garner, 304 S.C. 220, 403 S.E.2d 631 (1991); State v. Shumate, 276 S.C. 46, 275 S.E.2d 288 (1981); State v. Winestock, 271 S.C. 473, 248 S.E.2d 307 (1978).\r\nIn State v. Johnston, the supreme court provided guidance applicable to the case at hand.Â  Johnston was arrested, charged, and convicted for possession of marijuana and conspiracy to possess marijuana with the intent to distribute.Â  Johnston, 333 S.C. at 460, 510 S.E.2d at 424.Â  The trial judge sentenced Johnston to ten yearsâ€™ incarceration for the conspiracy charge.Â  Id.Â  Johnston raised no objection to the sentence at that time.Â  Id.Â  On appeal, Johnston questioned the trial judgeâ€™s authority to impose a prison sentence of ten years for a conspiracy conviction.Â  Id. at 461, 510 S.E.2d at 424.Â  Johnston argued this issue could be raised for the first time on appeal because the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to render a sentence exceeding the maximum allowed by law.Â  Id.Â  The supreme court rejected Johnstonâ€™s argument that this was an issue of subject matter jurisdiction, and held it was merely an issue of the trial courtâ€™s sentencing authority.Â  Id. at 462, 510 S.E.2d at 424.Â  \r\nIn so holding, the Johnston court relied on precedent that has specifically distinguished a trial courtâ€™s sentencing authority from its subject matter jurisdiction in the context of error preservation.Â  Id. at 463, 510 S.E.2d at 425; see also State v. Walker, 252 S.C. 325, 166 S.E.2d 209 (1969) (disposing of the defendantâ€™s challenge to his sentence because it was not raised to the trial judge and such challenge did not implicate the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court); State v. Salisbury, 330 S.C. 250, 498 S.E.2d 655 (Ct. App. 1998) (holding any alleged error in sentencing is not jurisdictional; therefore, a contemporaneous objection is required to preserve the issue for appellate review); State v. Bynes, 304 S.C. 62, 403 S.E.2d 126 (Ct. App. 1991) (same proposition).Â  Moreover, the court stated that a challenge to sentencing must be raised at trial, or the issue will not be preserved for appellate review.Â  Id. at 462, 510 S.E.2d at 425.Â  The court ultimately concluded that while this would ordinarily be an issue resolved in a post-conviction relief action, failure to preserve the issue for review should be excused on the basis that if the court did not reach the merits, Johnston could serve a sentence that exceeded the maximum allowable under the law.Â  Id. at 464, 510 S.E.2d at 425.\r\nThe concerns of the Johnston court are not present here as the sentence imposed by the trial judge was within the mandated statutory guidelines.Â  Therefore, the ordinary rules of issue preservation in the context of sentencing apply.Â  \r\nIn this matter, after the sentence was imposed, Johnson failed to enter an objection on the record.Â  Moreover, Johnson did not move for reconsideration of his sentence.Â  Therefore, we are constrained by the preservation barrier.Â  Johnson will be forced to seek any redress through post-conviction relief.Â  See Toal, Vafai, and Muckenfuss, Appellate Practice in South Carolina at 62 (2d ed. 2002) (â€œIn criminal cases, although the failure of an attorney to preserve an issue at trial will preclude appellate review of that issue, it may nonetheless be a ground in a civil action for post-conviction relief as a claim of ineffective counsel.â€).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause we find this issue unpreserved for appellate review, Johnsonâ€™s sentence for escape is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., ANDERSON and KITTREDGE, JJ. concur.Â \r\n\r\n[1] In his appellate brief, Johnson did not argue any of the recognized exceptions to the general rules of error preservation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-195","title":"In The Interest of A., Corey, A Juvenile Under The Age of Seventeen","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayUnPubOpinion.cfm?caseNo=2006-UP-195","description":null,"date":"2006-04-12","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS OPINION HAS NO PRECEDENTIAL VALUE.Â  IT SHOULD NOT BE CITED OR RELIED ON AS\r\nPRECEDENT IN ANY PROCEEDING EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY RULE 239(d)(2), SCACR.\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn The Interest of A., Corey, A Juvenile Under The Age of Seventeen,\r\nAppellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Richland County\r\nÂ Donna S.

Â The petition alleged that over a period of two months Corey engaged in criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the second degree.Â  Pursuant to a plea agreement, he pled guilty to the lesser-included offense of ABHAN on November 16, 2004.Â  The court adjudicated Corey delinquent and ordered him to undergo a community evaluation.Â  Subsequently, on March 16, 2005, Corey reappeared before the family court for a dispositional hearing.Â  The court committed him to the Department of Juvenile Justice for a period not to exceed his twenty-first birthday.Â  Corey appeals arguing the family court failed to comply with the mandates set forth in Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238 (1969).Â  Pursuant to Anders v.

Dowling and Andrea C. Pope, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nBarry L. Johnson, of Bluffton and David J. Parrish, of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Sammy Garrison Construction Company (Garrison) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal of its mechanicâ€™s lien on the basis it failed to serve the property owner as contemplated under section 29-5-90 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005), and as a consequence of this dismissal, the circuit courtâ€™s granting of attorney fees to Anchor Bank and Frank and Madeline Russo as prevailing parties.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThis action arises out of the construction of improvements at Island Putt and Drive, Inc. (IPD) located in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.Â  IPD is a corporation owned equally by Frank and Madeline Russo (the Russos), their nephew Mike Russo, and his wife Katherine Russo.Â  IPD is situated on land owned exclusively by the Russos, which it leases pursuant to a lease agreement.Â  The Russos are retired and live in Pennsylvania.Â  Mike Russo is the president of IPD and the person in charge of operating the business.Â Â Â  \r\nAt some point prior to this suit, the owners of IPD decided improvements should be made to the land.Â  To make these improvements, the Russos gave Mike Russo a special limited power of attorney for the purpose of allowing Mike Russo to execute certain loan documents on behalf of the Russos in connection with the improvements and construction.Â  Anchor Bank entered into a Mortgage and Security Agreement with the Russos and IPD for the project.Â  The mortgage contained a standard future advance clause for a construction loan, under which the amount of the mortgage was increased as the loan proceeds were released to pay the general contractorâ€™s periodic draw requests as construction progressed.Â Â Â  \r\nFollowing acquisition of the construction loan from Anchor Bank, Mike Russo contracted with Boru Enterprises, d/b/a Brady Builders (Brady), to serve as the general contractor for the improvements.Â  As the project neared completion, Brady discontinued paying certain subcontractors for their labor, service, or materials.Â  Sammy Garrison Construction Company (Garrison) was one of many subcontractors that filed a mechanicâ€™s lien against the property.\r\nThe instant lawsuit involves a $257,000 draw payment check that Anchor Bank inadvertently released to Brady before a title update revealed that Garrison had filed a mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  Anchor Bank was named as a defendant in this action due to its having a duly recorded first priority lien mortgage on the property.Â  Garrison, through its former legal counsel, filed a Notice and Certificate of Mechanicâ€™s Lien in the amount of $177,316.40 against the Russosâ€™ property.Â  Garrison served the notice of the mechanicâ€™s lien on Mike Russo on July 8, 1999.Â  \r\nGarrison filed its original Summons and Complaint on September 7, 1999.Â  The circuit court granted summary judgment to the Russos on the basis that proper notice had not been given concerning the mechanicâ€™s lien placed on the Russosâ€™ property.Â  However, the circuit court then rescinded the order granting summary judgment pursuant to a motion to reconsider, on September 21, 2001, and ordered a trial be held.Â  Testimony was taken and the circuit court again held that the Russos were not served with proper notice.Â  This appeal followed an unsuccessful Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion for reconsideration.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\nTypically, an action to foreclose a mechanicâ€™s lien is an action at law in South Carolina.Â  Keeneyâ€™s Metal Roofing, Inc. v. Palmieri, 345 S.C. 550, 553, 548 S.E.2d 900, 901 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œIn an action at law, tried without a jury, the judgeâ€™s findings will not be disturbed unless they are without evidentiary support.â€Â  King v. PYA/Monarch, Inc., 317 S.C. 385, 388-89, 453 S.E.2d 885, 888 (1995).Â  â€œHis findings are equivalent to those of a jury in an action at law.â€Â  Id. at 389, 453 S.E.2d at 888.Â  However, the instant case is not a typical mechanicâ€™s lien case, and comes to us in an unusual posture.Â  Summary judgment was denied, yet the circuit court proceeded to take evidence, not on the merits of the case, but only in connection with the summary judgment motionâ€™s issue of notice and proper service.&nbsp; The circuit court decided the case on the very basis encompassed in the summary judgment motion.&nbsp; Therefore this case is, in reality, the granting, after taking testimony, of the defendantsâ€™ summary judgment motion.&nbsp;\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, appellate courts apply the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP which states that summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d, 857, 860 (2002).Â  On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.Â  Willis v. Wu, 362 S.C. 146, 151, 607 S.E.2d 63, 65 (2004); see also Schmidt v. Courtney, 357 S.C. 310, 317, 592 S.E.2d 326, 330 (Ct. App. 2003) (stating all ambiguities,\r\nconclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed most strongly against the moving party).\r\nWe need not resolve the question of the standard of review and whether we should view the instant case as an action at law or as a review of a grant of summary judgment, because we are convinced that the judgment below should be reversed, even if we were to apply the most deferential standard of review.&nbsp; Having carefully reviewed the record, the evidence is susceptible of only one reasonable inference â€“ that is, Mike Russo was the agent for the property owners in connection with the construction of improvements to the real property.&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGarrison raises several arguments before this court; however, we need only address one: the contention Garrison properly served Mike Russo as an agent with the actual authority to accept service of the mechanicâ€™s lien on behalf of the property owners.Â  We agree and hold service under section 29-5-90 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) was proper.\r\nSection 29-5-90 specifies that a mechanicâ€™s lien must be served on the owner of the property to which the lien will attach.Â  Although mechanicâ€™s liens are purely statutory, and the requirements of the statute must be strictly followed, our courts have recognized that the laws of agency apply to the statutes controlling the creation and perfection of mechanicâ€™s liens.Â  See Hodge v. First Federal Sav. and Loan Assâ€™n, 267 S.C. 270, 274-75, 227 S.E.2d 310, 312 (1976) (finding the statute creating the right to a lien expressly contemplates utilization of principal-agent liability to establish the existence of liens); see also Shelley Const. Co., Inc. v. Sea Garden Hones, Inc., 287 S.C. 24, 27, 336 S.E.2d 488, 490 (Ct. App. 1985) (noting mechanicâ€™s liens are purely statutory and can only be acquired and enforced in accordance with the conditions of the statute creating them).Â  Moreover, as mechanicâ€™s lien statutes are remedial, they are to be given a liberal construction.Â  Clo-Car Trucking Co., Inc. v. Clifflue Estates of South Carolina, Inc., 282 S.C. 573, 575-76, 320 S.E.2d 51, 53 (Ct. App. 1984); See also 53 Am.Jur. 2d Mechanicâ€™s Liens Â§ 235 (1996) (â€œ[T]echnical requirements should not stand in the way of achieving the purposes of the mechanicâ€™s lien law.Â  Even though a claim contains some defect or error it will be upheld where the owner is informed of the claim and not misled by it or prejudiced.â€).\r\nAn agency relationship may be established by evidence of actual or apparent authority.Â  Coburn v. Leventis, 366 S.C. 20, 39, 619 S.E.2d 437, 448 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Actual authority is that which is expressly conferred upon the agent by the principal.Â \r\nRoberson v. Southern Finance of South Carolina, Inc., 365 S.C. 6, 11, 615 S.E.2d 112, 115 (2005).Â  The courts must look to the circumstances surrounding the relationship and find authority which is either express or implied from the type of relationship between the defendant and the purported agent.Â  Moore v. Simpson, 322 S.C. 518, 523, 473 S.E.2d 64, 66-67 (1996) (citing Hamilton v. Davis, 300 S.C. 411, 414, 389 S.E.2d 297, 298 (Ct. App. 1990)).Â  There must be evidence the defendant intended to confer authority to receive service.Â  Id.\r\nThe evidence shows the Russos intended to confer the actual authority upon Mike Russo to receive service.Â  It is important to note that this was not a case where there was simply a property owner and a separate, leasing business.[1]Â  Rather, the two were intermingled.Â  In fact, the Russos purchased the land for the sole purpose of creating IPD.Â  Because the Russos lived in Pennsylvania, it was natural that they have an agent acting on their behalf concerning the construction of improvements to the real property.Â  Mike Russo, the Russosâ€™ business partner and nephew, fulfilled this need.\r\nThe record before us indisputably establishes Mike Russo as the Russosâ€™ express agent.Â  Mike Russo managed the day-to-day affairs of the property and the business on the Russosâ€™ behalf.Â  More to the point, he conducted all of the negotiations for the construction, including its day-to-day oversight.Â  The various contractors reported to Mike Russo.Â  Further, he negotiated and executed the contract with Brady, the general contractor.Â  Mr. Russo admitted Mike Russo was authorized to â€œhandle[] everything at the job site.â€Â  Additionally, although not dispositive, the Russos gave Mike Russo a specific power of attorney in order to secure loans for the improvements to the property.Â  See S.C. Jurisprudence Agency Â§ 47 (1994) (â€œBeing of special and limited nature and authority, a power of attorney must be strictly construed to carry out and not defeat the purpose of appointment and to sanction only the acts clearly within its terms.â€) (citing Martin v. United States, 249 F.Supp. 204 (D.S.C. 1966)).Â  The loan for the construction and the property are inextricably linked.Â  The power of attorney did not specifically grant Mike Russo the license to receive service; however, we find the document along with the other circumstances surrounding the relationship confirm Mike Russoâ€™s actual authority as the Russosâ€™ express agent for this purpose.Â  \r\nThe evidence of actual authority is inescapable in light of Mr. Russoâ€™s candid testimony:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         [Mike Russo] handled everything at the job\r\n          site.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q:&nbsp;\r\n         Did you all consult back and forth with what\r\n          was going on?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:\r\n         After the fact.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        . . . .\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q:\r\n         Well describe to me how you all worked.Â  I donâ€™t mean to try to put words in your\r\n          mouth. Tell me how the job worked.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:&nbsp;\r\n         From time to time he would call me and say Â Â Â Â Â Â  that particular problem was or good thing was Â Â Â Â Â Â  happening and I would counsel him at that Â  point.Â  Say yes, sounds good or no.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n&nbsp;When Mike Russo became aware of the fact that liens were going to be placed on the property, he called Mr. Russo, told him liens were going to appear, and that he â€œwas going to handle them.â€Â  Mr. Russo further admitted that he â€œleft all the corporate decisions in that fashion up to Michael.Â  Michael was going to handle the liens.â€Â  All Mr. Russo wanted was for Mike Russo to â€œkeep him abreastâ€ of the liens.Â  The record is barren of any suggestion that Mike Russo was without authority to handle all construction matters, including the Garrison mechanicâ€™s lien.\r\nWe categorically reject the contention that the Russos did not receive actual notice of the mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  Mike Russo testified that he delivered the mechanicâ€™s lien to the corporate lawyer, and it is unchallenged that Mike Russo informed Mr. Russo of the liens as reflected by Mr. Russoâ€™s testimony.Â  The same evidence which shows the express agency relationship between Mike Russo and the Russos dispels any notion that the Russos did not have notice of the liens.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we find service upon Mike Russo as the property ownerâ€™s agent was proper under section 29-5-90.Â  Having found that notice was proper, we do not reach Garrisonâ€™s remaining assignments of error.Â  Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (â€œappellate court need not address remaining issues when disposition of prior issue is dispositiveâ€).Â  Further, we reverse the award of attorneyâ€™s fees to both Anchor Bank and the Russos under section 29-5-20(a) because they are no longer prevailing parties.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe decision of the circuit court is \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., ANDERSON and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  At oral argument, the Russos argued that under F &amp; D Elec. Contractors, Inc., v. Powder Coaters, Inc., 350 S.C. 454, 567 S.E.2d 842 (2002), for the mechanicâ€™s lien to be enforceable against them, they must have consented to the modifications through an express or implied agreement about the specific work to be done, and the general lease provisions allowing a tenant to make improvements is not enough.Â  However, this argument does not take into consideration the unique situation we have in this case â€“ the Russos are both the landowners and the tenants as part owners of IPD.Â  It is irrefutable that the Russos not only consented to the improvements on the property, but were a driving force behind the decision to make the improvements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-204","title":"State v.

Irmo High School,&nbsp;321 S.C. 426, 435, 468 S.E.2d 861, 866&nbsp;(1996) (holding that the courts lack subject matter jurisdiction to review suspensions of less than ten days); Floyd v.

Toal, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nVernon F. Dunbar, of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Cynthia Cunningham brought a cause of action against Mixon Day Care for negligence arising from injuries sustained by Cunninghamâ€™s daughter (Daughter) while under Mixon Day Careâ€™s supervision.Â  The trial court granted a directed verdict in favor of Mixon Day Care.Â  Cunningham appeals the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  We affirm.Â Â Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn December 8, 2000, Daughter, then eighteen (18) months old, was assaulted by a four-year-old child while both children were under the care and supervision of Mixon Day Care in Columbia, South Carolina.Â  Daughter was scratched on her head, neck, and back, and bitten on her eyelid.Â  As a result of this assault, Daughter underwent surgery and received five stitches in her eyelid.Â  Her medical bills totaled $6,759.50.Â Â  \r\nOn December 5, 2003, Cunningham filed suit on behalf of Daughter against Mixon Day Care.Â  The suit alleged negligent, willful, wanton, careless, and grossly negligent behavior on the part of Mixon Day Care.Â  \r\nAt trial, Cunningham was Daughterâ€™s sole witness.Â  Cunningham testified that she dropped Daughter off at Mixon Day Care on December 8, 2000.Â  In the early afternoon, Rosa Weathersby, one of the proprietors of the day care center, called Cunningham and informed her that Daughter had been scratched and needed immediate medical attention.Â  Cunningham drove to the day care center to retrieve Daughter and saw that Daughterâ€™s injuries were â€œmore severe than a scratch.â€Â Â Â  \r\nCunningham learned another child at the day care center, a four-year-old boy, assaulted Daughter and caused her injuries.Â  Cunningham took Daughter to her pediatricianâ€™s office and then to an eye specialist.Â  Cunningham testified that Daughter had surgery on her eye the following day and received five stitches in her eyelid.Â  In addition to her testimony describing these events, Cunningham submitted six photographs depicting Daughterâ€™s injuries. Â The photographs were taken at the doctorâ€™s office on the day of the assault.Â  Â Â Â \r\nAfter cross-examining Cunningham, Mixon Day Care moved for a directed verdict arguing Cunningham offered no proof Mixon Day Care was negligent.Â  In response, Cunningham argued the photographs were â€œclear evidence that there was a lack of supervision,â€ and demonstrate â€œthat it took some time to do this amount of damage.â€Â  The trial court found Cunningham failed to present sufficient evidence that Mixon Day Care breached a duty of care and, thus, granted a directed verdict for Mixon Day Care.Â  \r\nThe trial court denied Cunninghamâ€™s motion for reconsideration.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing a motion for directed verdict, the appellate court applies the same standard as the circuit court. Â Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 299, 536 S.E.2d 408, 418 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The court must view the evidence and the inferences that can reasonably be drawn in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).Â  If the evidence as a whole is susceptible of more than one reasonable inference, a jury issue is created and the motion should be denied. Â Bailey v. Segars, 346 S.C. 359, 366, 550 S.E.2d 910, 913\r\n(Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œIn essence, the court must determine whether a verdict for the opposing party â€˜would be reasonably possible under the facts as liberally construed in his favor.â€™â€ Â Love v. Gamble, 316 S.C. 203, 208, 448 S.E.2d 876, 879 (Ct. App. 1994) (quoting Bultman v. Barber, 277 S.C. 5, 7, 281 S.E.2d 791, 792 (1981)). \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nCunningham contends the trial court erred in granting Mixon Day Careâ€™s directed verdict motion because circumstantial evidence presented a question of fact for the jury.Â  Specifically, Cunningham argues the photographs, the injuries sustained, and the ages of the victim and assailant provide a reasonable inference of negligence.[1]Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œTo establish negligence the plaintiff must prove the defendant failed to exercise due care in some respect.â€Â  Sunvillas Homeowners Assâ€™n v. Square D Co., 301 S.C. 330, 333, 391 S.E.2d 868, 870 (Ct. App. 1990). Â Generally, â€œ[t]he focus is upon the action of the defendant.â€Â \r\nId.Â  \r\nâ€œ[N]egligence may be proved by circumstantial evidence as well as direct evidence.â€Â  Chaney v. Burgess, 246 S.C. 261, 266, 143 S.E.2d 521, 523 (1965).Â  â€œProof of negligence may rest entirely on circumstances, and circumstantial evidence alone may authorize a finding of negligence.â€Â \r\nChilders v. Gas Lines, Inc., 248 S.C. 316, 322, 149 S.E.2d 761, 764 (1966).Â  â€œ[A]ny fact in issue may be established by circumstantial evidence, if the circumstances, which must themselves be proven lead to the conclusion with reasonable certainty.â€Â  Marks v. Indus. Life &amp; Health Ins. Co., 212 S.C. 502, 505, 48 S.E.2d 445, 446-47 (1948) (cited with approval in\r\nGilliland v. Doe, 357 S.C. 197, 202, 592 S.E.2d 626, 629 (2004)).Â  Â Â Â \r\nThis court has defined circumstantial evidence as follows: \r\n\r\nCircumstantial evidence means proof that does not actually assert or represent the proposition in question, but that asserts or describes something else, from which the trier of fact may either (1) reasonably infer the truth of the proposition, in which case the evidence is not only relevant under Rule 401 but is sufficient as well, or (2) at least reasonably infer an increase in the probability that the proposition is in fact true, in which case the evidence is relevant under Rule 401 (assuming that the proposition is of consequence to the determination of the action) but may not be sufficient by itself to create a question for the trier of fact to decide. \r\n\r\nGastineau v. Murphy, 323 S.C. 168, 178-79, 473 S.E.2d 819, 826 (Ct. App. 1996) (quoting 29 Am. Jur. 2d Evidence Â§ 313 (1994)), revâ€™d on other grounds, 331 S.C. 565, 503 S.E.2d 712 (1998).Â  \r\nâ€œ[I]n determining the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence, the facts and circumstances shown are to be reckoned with in the light of ordinary experience and such conclusions deduced therefrom as common sense dictates.â€Â  Chaney, 246 S.C. at 266, 143 S.E.2d at 523.Â  â€œWhere circumstantial evidence is relied upon to establish liability, the plaintiff must show such circumstances as would justify the inference that his injuries were due to the negligent act of the defendant, and not leave the question to mere conjecture or speculation.â€Â  Id.\r\nIn South Carolina, the use of circumstantial evidence to prove a reasonable inference of negligence generally requires more than proof of an injury, no matter the extent of the injury.Â  See, e.g.,\r\nGastineau v. Murphy, 331 S.C. 565, 571, 503 S.E.2d 712, 715 (1998) (reversing denial of JNOV where plaintiff offered no evidence employer may have been informed employee reported a possible violation before employee terminated);\r\nLegette v. Smith, 265 S.C. 573, 577, 220 S.E.2d 429, 430 (1975) (affirming a directed verdict for defendant when no evidence that defendant was negligent in inspecting or installing septic tank and nothing in record revealed when top of tank fell in or what caused it);Â \r\nMcQuillen v. Dobbs, 262 S.C. 386, 392, 204 S.E.2d 732, 735 (1974) (affirming the denial of a directed verdict when plaintiff established reasonable inference defendantâ€™s negligent inspection of furnace led to fire based partially on testimony regarding recommended procedures for the proper inspection and maintenance of furnace that defendantâ€™s failed to follow); Sunvillas Homeowners Assâ€™n v. Square D Co., 301 S.C. 330, 333-34, 391 S.E.2d 868, 870 (Ct. App. 1990) (affirming directed verdict for manufacturer in products liability suit where only evidence presented was that circuit breaker did not work as intended which at most jury left to speculate how defendant failed to exercise due care).Â  \r\nMixon Day Care had a duty to maintain â€œ[a]dequate supervision . . . at all times,â€ over the children in their care.Â  27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-503, Part A(3) (Supp. 2004).[2]Â  â€œAdequate supervision requires awareness of and responsibility for the ongoing activity of each child, knowledge of activity requirements and childrenâ€™s needs and accountability for their care,â€ and â€œalso requires . . . being near and having ready access to children in order to intervene when needed.â€Â  27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-500, Part A(8) (Supp. 2004).\r\nWe find, from the evidence introduced at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to Cunningham, no reasonable jury could have concluded Mixon Day Care failed to provide adequate supervision over Daughter or her assailant without engaging in â€œmere conjecture or speculation.â€Â  Chaney, 246 S.C. at 266, 143 S.E.2d at 523.Â  The only evidence in the record is Daughter suffered injuries from an assault while under the supervision of Mixon Day Care.Â  The record completely lacks any comment on or evidence of Mixon Day Careâ€™s action or inaction surrounding the assault.Â  \r\nThe only comments or evidence regarding Mixon Day Careâ€™s supervision, other than the inferences gained from the photographs or injuries, are favorable.Â  Cunningham testified that she â€œfelt good aboutâ€ the facility, had â€œ[a] very good feeling about [Mixon Day Care],â€ and that, before this incident, she was generally pleased with the services Mixon Day Care provided.Â  Further, no evidence was introduced to suggest that the injuries sustained were consistent with a prolonged attack.Â  In fact, Cunningham failed to offer evidence regarding the number of scratches or bites.Â  \r\nUndeniably, one may reasonably infer an increase in the probability of negligence from the photographs and testimony introduced at trial; however, without more, one cannot reasonably infer negligence under the specific facts of this case.[3]Â  See, e.g.,\r\nGastineau, 331 S.C. at 571, 503 S.E.2d at 715; Legette, 265 S.C. at 577, 220 S.E.2d at 430;\r\nMcQuillen, 262 S.C. at 392, 204 S.E.2d at 735; Sunvillas Homeowners Assâ€™n, 301 S.C. at 333-34, 391 S.E.2d at 870.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court did not err in directing a verdict for Mixon Day Care because the circumstantial evidence relied upon does not justify the inference that the injuries were â€œdue to the negligent act of the defendant.â€ Chaney, 246 S.C. at 266, 143 S.E.2d at 523 (emphasis added).Â  \r\nWithout requiring more than proof of an injury, the court would be going directly against our decisions which â€œuniformly state that the so called doctrine of res ipsa loquitur does not apply in this State.â€Â  Chaney, 246 S.C. at 266, 143 S.E.2d at 523; see King v. J.C. Penney Co., 238 S.C. 336, 339-40, 120 S.E.2d 229, 230 (1961) (â€œSouth Carolina has consistently refused to adopt the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur although it is the law in many other jurisdictions.Â  In this State it is well settled that the burden rests upon the party to prove negligence.Â  This burden cannot be met by relying upon the theory that the thing speaks for itself or that the very fact of injury indicates negligence.â€); Snow v. City of Columbia, 305 S.C. 544, 555, 409 S.E.2d 797, 803 (Ct. App. 1991) (â€œ[The] burden of proof [for negligence] cannot be met by relying on the theory that the thing speaks for itself or that the very fact of injury indicates a failure to exercise reasonable care.Â  No inference of negligence arises from the mere fact of injury.â€)(citations omitted).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the trial court correctly granted a directed verdict for Mixon Day Care.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â Â  Cunningham raises three separate arguments in her brief.Â  Because each of these arguments challenges the trial courtâ€™s decision to grant the motion for a directed verdict, we have consolidated the arguments under one heading in the interest of clarity and brevity.\r\n[2] Â We refer to this version of the regulation because it was in effect at the time of the incident.Â  We note, however, the regulation has been rewritten.Â  The amended regulation became effective on June 24, 2005.Â  27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-503 (Supp. 2005).\r\n[3]Â Â  We emphasize that our decision should not be interpreted that a plaintiffâ€™s reliance on photographs as evidence of negligence is never sufficient to survive a motion for a directed verdict.Â  Instead, our holding is limited to the specific facts of this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-212","title":"State v.

Stanton Cross, Jr., Master-in-Equity\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-221\r\nSubmitted March 1, 2006 â€“ Filed April 18, 2006\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nGeorge E. Graham, of Conway, for Appellants.\r\nThelma Corbitt and Maxine C. Todd, both of Surfside Beach, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this boundary dispute case, Albert and Linzsy Simmons (Appellants) appeal the decision of the master-in-equity to divide the area in controversy evenly between them and Respondents Thelma Corbitt and Maxine C. Todd.[1]Â  We reverse.[2]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1970, Appellants had their property surveyed to determine where to locate a water pump house.Â  The survey showed a gap between the property belonging to Appellants and the adjacent property belonging to Thelma and Herbert Corbitt.[3]Â  Despite their knowledge that they did not have record title to gap, Appellants located their water pump house in the area.[4]\r\nIn 1990, Appellants tore down the water pump house.Â  Subsequently, their son moved his mobile home within twenty inches of the gap and used the area as his back yard.Â  On September 13, 1993, Respondents had their property surveyed by Sur-Tech, Incorporated.Â  This survey shows the gap and contains the following explanation: \r\n\r\nThe triangle shaped parcel described hereon, represents an existing gap between adjoining owners[.]Â  The adjoining owners deeds and plats satisfied within reason, both mathematically and with bearings and distances, does substantiate and support the existing gap shown.\r\n\r\nAfter the survey by Sur-Tec, Respondents put logs in the gap area.Â  They also planted flowers, mowed the grass, and parked cars there.Â  These actions prompted Appellants to file a complaint on November 10, 1998, claiming the gap by adverse possession.Â  Respondents answered, denying Appellantsâ€™ adverse possession claim and asserting they owned the gap through chain of title.Â  Respondents further alleged they owned the property under color of title and exercised dominion and control over their respective portions of it.\r\nBefore trial, Appellants hired Larry Thomas Beasley to survey their property.Â  Beasley, in his deposition de bene esse, opined the gap belonged to Appellants based on the earliest recorded plat, which was recorded in 1921.Â  Moreover, he explained the gap was created in 1954, when the second recorded plat of the area used a dividing line inconsistent with the 1921 plat.Â  Furthermore, Beasley pointed out the inconsistency created by the 1954 plat caused the gap to be included in the Corbittsâ€™ property.Â  Every plat subsequent thereto showed the gap without noting ownership.Â  \r\nAt trial, Linzsy Simmons testified she knew another party owned the gap as early as 1970, when she had the water pump house placed there.Â  Herbert Corbitt testified he thought his mother owned the gap in 1927 and he owned the property through chain of title since that time.Â  He further testified he never meant to take the gap from its rightful owner.Â  Todd testified she thought she owned the gap because her father had always told her they owned the gap.Â  Todd additionally testified she would not try to deprive the rightful owner of possession of the gap.Â  Thelma Corbitt, too, testified she always thought the gap belonged to her.Â  The record before us indicates neither Todd nor the Corbitts testified before the master about any objective indication of ownership of the gap before 1993.\r\nThe master found the dispute arose because of the inconsistent surveys in 1921 and 1954.Â  The master further found â€œ[a]ll parties to this action have testified that they have been exercising continuing dominion and control over the disputed property in an exclusive, hostile manner for more than 28 years.â€Â  Based on his findings, the master used â€œthe equitable powers of this courtâ€ to hold â€œthe disputed parcel of real estate should be divided equally between [Appellants] and [Respondents].â€Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œBecause an adverse possession claim is an action at law, the character of the possession is a question for the jury or fact finder.â€[5]Â  Our review is therefore â€œlimited to a determination of whether any evidence reasonably tends to support the masterâ€™s findings.â€[6]Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWe agree with Appellants that the master erred in finding Respondents had established a valid claim to the property through adverse possession.[7]\r\nâ€œA plaintiffâ€™s title by adverse possession requires proof of actual, open, notorious, hostile, continuous, and exclusive possession by the claimant, or by one or more persons through whom he claimed, for the full statutory period.â€[8]Â  Since 1882, South Carolinaâ€™s adverse possession statutes have been â€œvirtually unchangedâ€[9] and provide a statutory time period of ten years.[10]Â  \r\nMoreover, in boundary line disputes, South Carolina adheres to the rule that â€œpossession under a mistaken belief that property is oneâ€™s own and with no intent to claim against the propertyâ€™s true owner cannot constitute hostile possession.â€ [11] \r\nThe record before us is devoid of evidence of any objective indications of ownership of the disputed property by Respondents before 1993.Â  In addition, the record before us affirmatively shows Respondents operated under the assumption the gap belonged to them through chain of title; therefore, they never intended to dispossess the true owner.Â  Without evidence of such intent, we hold the master erred in finding Respondents could claim ownership of the gap through adverse possession.[12]Â  \r\n REVERSED.\r\n GOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Appellants filed this action as one to determine the boundary line between the partiesâ€™ properties.Â  Moreover, Thelma Corbitt and Maxine C. Todd (collectively Respondents) answered and requested a determination of the boundary line between the properties.Â  Finally, the masterâ€™s order indicates this is a boundary line dispute case.Â  We therefore treat this case as one to determine the proper boundary line between the partiesâ€™ properties.\r\n[2]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  In determining oral argument would not aid the court in resolving this appeal, we note that the record on appeal does not contain the full transcript of the trial before the master and that Respondents did not file a brief.Â  For purposes of this appeal, then, we consider the record only as it was presented to us.Â  See Rule 208(a)(4), SCACR (â€œUpon the failure of respondent to timely file a brief, the appellate court may take such action as it deems proper.â€); Campbell v. Carr, 361 S.C. 258, 266-67, 603 S.E.2d 625, 629&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004) (Goolsby, J., concurring) (explaining that under Rule 208(a)(4), SCACR, the appellate court can reverse without searching the record for reasons to affirm); Wierszewski v. Tokarick, 308 S.C. 441, 444 n.2, 418 S.E.2d 557, 559&nbsp;n.2 (Ct. App. 1992) (â€œIn this case, we deem it proper to reverse on the points presented rather than to search the record for reasons to affirm.â€).\r\n[3] Thelma Corbitt deeded a part of her interest in the property adjacent to the gap to Todd, who is the Corbittsâ€™ daughter, on September 28, 1993.Â  Herbert Corbitt deeded all his interest in the property adjacent to the gap to Todd on October 20, 1996, and therefore is not a party to this action.Â  \r\n[4] Linzsy Simmons testified she believed the gap belonged to Burroughs and Collins Co.\r\n[5]Â  Miller v.

Babb, of Calabash; for Appellant.\r\nJames B. Van Osdell and Cindy Graham Howe, of Myrtle Beach; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Brenda R. Babb appeals a decision allowing Van Osdell, Lester, Howe &amp; Jordan, P.A., (the Law Firm) to withdraw as her counsel.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn November 4, 1999, Babb hired the Law Firm to represent her at a series of shareholders meetings in an effort to resolve differences between Babb and Carey E. Graham.Â  Babb and Graham were shareholders in Cable Plus of Carolina, Inc., and members of Southbridge Cable Television, LLC.Â  After the negotiation efforts failed, the Law Firm filed a shareholderâ€™s derivative action on Babbâ€™s behalf on November 29, 2000, asserting causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, misappropriation of corporate opportunity, and breach of contract.\r\nBabb also hired the Law Firm to represent her in an unrelated action that had been transferred to Charleston County and scheduled for a bench trial.Â  Immediately before the bench trial, Babb rejected a settlement offer from the opposing party and the bench trial proceeded in March 2004.Â  \r\nOn May 24, 2004, the Law Firm moved to be relieved as Babbâ€™s counsel in the present lawsuit.Â  In the motion, attorney James B. Van Osdell stated representation of Babb had become â€œunreasonably difficultâ€ either because Babbâ€™s objective in the litigation had changed from what he understood it to be when he agreed to represent her or because he no longer understood her objective.Â  Van Osdell further alleged it was unreasonably difficult to continue representing Babb because she was not in control of the case decisions even though she was the named plaintiff.Â  On the required motion cover sheet, the Law Firm requested a hearing and the presence of a court reporter.Â  While the motion was pending, the Law Firm continued to represent Babb zealously at depositions, motion hearings, and other matters in the underlying case.\r\nThe hearing was scheduled for July 29, 2004.Â  When Cynthia Graham Howe, another attorney in the Law Firm, appeared to argue the motion, she was advised that, at Babbâ€™s request, that the visiting judge assigned to the case would hear the matter in his chambers.Â  The attorney representing the opposing party in the underlying litigation consented to the motion and did not attend the hearing. \r\nWhen Babb arrived for the hearing, she presented copies to both Howe and the presiding judge of her memorandum in opposition to the Law Firmâ€™s motion.[2]Â  In her memorandum, Babb argued that allowing counsel to withdraw would be extremely prejudicial and detrimental to her and requested â€œlegal fees paid in this case be refunded.â€\r\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court granted the motion and requested Howe to prepare a proposed order.Â  The presiding judge also instructed Howe to send a copy of the order to Babb when the order was delivered to him.\r\nBabb timely moved for reconsideration of the order granting the Law Firmâ€™s motion to be relieved as counsel.Â  On September 13, 2004, after the Law Firm filed an affidavit in opposition to Babbâ€™s motion and Babb responded to the affidavit, the trial court denied the motion without a hearing.Â  Babb received written entry of the order on September 15, 2004, and filed her notice of appeal on October 5, 2004.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  We disagree with Babbâ€™s argument that the trial court erred in granting the Law Firmâ€™s motion to be relieved as her counsel.Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct permit a lawyer to withdraw from representing a client if â€œgood cause for withdrawal exists.â€[3]Â  â€œ[M]otions to withdraw [as counsel] must lie within the sound discretion of the trial judge.â€[4]\r\nIn granting the motion, the court found the Law Firm gave sufficient reasons for withdrawing from the case, namely that (1) Van Osdell was unable to represent Babb competently and zealously because he did not understand her litigation objectives; and (2) the problem was compounded because Babb was not solely in control of her case and the litigation objectives were not necessarily hers.Â  Van Osdellâ€™s affidavit supports these findings.Â  Furthermore, Babb does not contest the finding in the appealed order that she â€œconceded that she confers with her husband . . . on all decisions concerning this litigation.â€Â  Under these circumstances, we see no reason to disturb the trial courtâ€™s decision to relieve the Law Firm as Babbâ€™s counsel.[5]  \r\n2.Â  We decline to address Babbâ€™s argument that the trial court should have considered the prejudice to her resulting from the Law Firmâ€™s withdrawal in view of the duration of the case and the money she had already spent on legal fees.Â  The appealed order did not include a ruling on this argument.Â  Although Babb moved for reconsideration, she did not raise this issue in her motion.[6]\r\n3.Â  We find no merit to Babbâ€™s argument that the trial court erred in declining to hear oral argument on her motion for reconsideration. Â Such motions â€œmay in the discretion of the court be determined on the briefs filed by the parties without oral argument.â€[7]\r\nOn appeal Babb argues the following reasons warranted oral argument on her motion:Â  (1) she did not receive a copy of the proposed order until after the trial court signed the final order relieving counsel; and (2) contrary to her understanding that the trial court would retain jurisdiction over the issue of legal fees in the underlying case, the order relieving counsel instructed the parties to consult the Fee Dispute Board for resolution of the matter.Â  \r\nWe disagree that these circumstances warranted oral argument on Babbâ€™s motion for reconsideration.Â  Regardless of any oral rulings by the trial court after hearing the Law Firmâ€™s motion to be relieved as counsel, the court had the prerogative to alter its decision pending entry of the signed written order by the clerk of court.[8]Â  We therefore hold the trial court acted within its discretion in refusing to hear oral argument on Babbâ€™s motion.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Babb states in her brief on appeal that her memorandum was filed July 21, 2004; however, the filing date appearing on the motion included in the record is July 19, 2004.Â  Moreover, Babb notes she â€œprepared and offeredâ€ her memorandum, thus suggesting it was available at the hearing on July 19, 2004.\r\n[3]Â  Appellate Court Rule 407, Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.16(b)(7); see also In re Anonymous Member of the Bar, 298 S.C. 239, 240, 379 S.E.2d 723, 723 (1989) (â€œWhen it is necessary to obtain the permission of the tribunal to withdraw from representation and the client will not consent, the attorney will usually have to establish good cause for withdrawal.â€).\r\n[4]Â  Lucas v.

Â Vanover appeared and filed an answer stipulating to his negligence and admitting fault.Â  Following an order granting summary judgment as to liability in favor of the Lucases, the circuit court held a damages hearing.Â  \r\nAt the hearing on damages, Mr. Lucas testified that his 2001 Chevrolet Impala 4-door sedan was â€œtotaledâ€ and that his wife had to be cut from the car.Â  Without objection, he testified to the negotiations he had with his insurance company to settle on the amount of damage.Â  As a result of these negotiations, the Lucases were paid $24,800 for the vehicle. Â In addition, Mr. Lucas testified that towing and storage fees were incurred in the amount of $385, but there was a salvage value of the vehicle of $2,650.Â  \r\nTo contest the amount of damages claimed by the Lucases, Vanover presented the testimony of David Holder, an expert appraiser, who opined that the car could have been repaired for approximately $11,338.Â  Holder opined that the car did not meet the threshold for a total loss.Â  Holder testified there may be supplements, meaning additional damage, discovered once repairs were initiated.Â  The Lucasesâ€™ counsel asked Holder whether the supplements could have added $7,000 to $10,000 to the repair bill, to which Holder replied, over Vanoverâ€™s objection, that his estimate of the supplements would be an additional $500 to $1,000. Â Finally, Holder acknowledged that he could not testify as to the extent of the diminution of value of the car, but admitted there would be diminished value to the relatively new car.Â  \r\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court asked a series of questions, one of which was answered by the Lucasesâ€™ lawyer:Â  \r\n\r\nCourt:Â  How fast were the cars traveling?Â  \r\nCounsel for the Lucases:Â  Judge, according to the wreck report - - \r\nCounsel for Vanover:Â  Your Honor, I would just object to that coming in.Â  Thereâ€™s no Trooper here to testify.Â  The parties did not testify about how fast - - \r\nCourt:Â  They should have.Â  That goes directly to the amount of damage that was done to the car.Â  I think as the factfinder, Iâ€™m entitled â€“ really, I probably shouldâ€™ve asked them those questions when they were on the stand, but I didnâ€™t.Â  But Iâ€™m going to ask your expert a couple other questions too.Â  \r\n\r\nAfter another objection, the circuit court added that â€œwhat heâ€™s going to tell me [concerning the speeds of the vehicles] is just to satisfy my curiosity.â€Â  The attorney answered the circuit courtâ€™s question:\r\n\r\nCounsel for the Lucases:Â  Judge the wreck report indicates that our insured [the Lucases] was driving 50 miles an hour and the otherâ€”the defendant [Vanover], according to the wreck report, was doing 70, if Iâ€™m reading this correctly.\r\n\r\nIn its findings of fact, and during the hearing for the motion for reconsideration, the circuit court repeatedly stated that it had not given the speed of the vehicles any weight.\r\nThe circuit court determined the amount of damages to be $22,535.Â  Vanoverâ€™s motion to reconsider and alter or amend the judgment was subsequently denied.Â  This appeal centers around the evidence presented to support the circuit courtâ€™s determination of damages.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe admission of evidence is within the circuit courtâ€™s discretion. Â R &amp; G Constr., Inc. v. Lowcountry Regâ€™l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424, 439, 540 S.E.2d 113, 121 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The courtâ€™s ruling to admit or exclude evidence will only be reversed if it constitutes an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law. Â Elledge v. Richland/Lexington Sch. Dist. Five, 352 S.C. 179, 185, 573 S.E.2d 789, 792 (2002); see also Whaley v. CSX Transp., Inc., 362 S.C. 456, 483, 609 S.E.2d 286, 300 (2005) (observing admission of evidence\r\nwill not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion).Â  The circuit courtâ€™s decision will not be reversed on appeal unless it appears the court clearly abused its discretion and the objecting party was prejudiced by the decision. Â S.C. Prop. &amp; Cas. Guar. Assâ€™n v. Yensen, 345 S.C. 512, 524, 548 S.E.2d 880, 886 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTotal Loss \r\nVanover contends the circuit court erred in allowing Lucas to testify as to the damage to the vehicle, specifically whether the vehicle was â€œtotaled,â€ when the matter required specific, technical and specialized knowledge to understand the evidence presented and because such testimony lies strictly within the province of an expert.[1]Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n It is well settled in South Carolina that an owner of property may testify concerning its value and damages.Â  See, e.g., Waites v. S.C. Windstorm &amp; Hail Underwriting Assâ€™n, 279 S.C. 362, 366, 307 S.E.2d 223, 225 (1983) (stating that an owner may testify as to the extent of rain and windstorm damage); Hawkins v. Greenwood Dev. Corp., 328 S.C. 585, 594-95, 493 S.E.2d 875, 880 (Ct. App. 1997) (stating an owner may testify to the diminished value of his real property for failure to develop a proposed road); Hill v. City of Hanahan, 281 S.C. 527, 531-32, 316 S.E.2d 681, 684 (Ct. App. 1984) (stating that an owner may testify as to the value of real property taken in a condemnation setting).Â  This is not only the accepted rule in South Carolina jurisprudence, but it is also contemplated under the rules of evidence.Â  Rule 701, SCRE, provides for opinions or inferences by a laymen which: â€œ(a) are rationally based on the perception of the witness, (b) are helpful to a clear understanding of the witnessâ€™ testimony or the determination of a fact in issue, and (c) do not require special knowledge, skill, experience or training.â€Â  Furthermore, â€œconclusions or opinions of laymen should be rejected only when they are superfluous in the sense that they will be of no value to the jury.â€Â  Small v. Pioneer Mach., Inc., 329 S.C. 448, 468, 494 S.E.2d 835, 845 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  \r\nAs the owner of the car, Mr. Lucas was qualified to testify concerning its value after the wreck.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by admitting his testimony that the car was â€œtotaled.â€ \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSpeculative Testimony of Expert Witness \r\nVanover contends the circuit court erred in instructing Holder, his expert witness, to provide speculative testimony as to the supplemental repairs to the vehicle.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe admission or exclusion of expert testimony is a matter within the sound discretion of the circuit court.Â  Fields v. Regional Medical Center Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 25, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005).Â  The circuit courtâ€™s decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Pike v. S.C. Dept. of Transp., 343 S.C. 224, 234, 540 S.E.2d 87, 92 (2000).\r\nContrary to Vanoverâ€™s assertion, Holder never â€œspeculatedâ€ as to the costs of supplemental repairs; rather, Holder testified that supplemental repairs were likely.Â  He was qualified to provide an opinion regarding the initial costs of repairs, and was therefore able to provide an opinion regarding the likelihood additional repairs would be necessary.Â  \r\nMoreover, when asked if those supplements could have added another $7,000 to $10,000 to the repair estimate, Holder stated that in his opinion, the supplements would have been limited to a range of $500 to $1,000 based upon his original appraisal.Â  This answer supported Vanoverâ€™s argument. Â Thus, even if we found error in the admission of the expertâ€™s opinion on the dollar amounts for the supplemental repairs, Vanover has failed to demonstrate any prejudice resulting from the admission. Â Accordingly, we find the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Holderâ€™s testimony regarding supplemental repairs.Â  Â \r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nVehicle Speed \r\nVanover contends the circuit court erred in permitting the Lucasesâ€™ attorney to respond to the courtâ€™s inquiry concerning the speeds of the vehicles at the time of the accident.Â  Specifically, Vanover relies on the proposition that under section 56-5-1290 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005), no accident report â€œmay be evidence of the negligence or due care of either party at the trial of any action at law to recover damages.â€Â  We agree the information read from the accident report was inadmissible but find no reversible error.\r\nInitially, we note that comments or arguments made by counsel are not evidence.Â  See McManus v. City of Greenwood, 171 S.C. 84, 89, 171 S.E.2d 473, 475 (1933) (holding statements of fact\r\nappearing only in argument of counsel will not be considered as evidence); South Carolina Dept. of Transp. v. Thompson, 357 S.C. 101, 106, 590 S.E.2d 511, 513 (Ct. App. 2003) (â€œArguments made by counsel are not evidence.â€).Â  Moreover, in Brown v. Allstate, our supreme court set forth the role of a circuit court sitting without a jury:Â  \r\n\r\nAccording to the [lower court], if incompetent evidence is admitted on the ultimate issue of the trial, the trial judge must affirmatively reject this evidence, even if it is clear he is making a judgment based on competent evidence in the record. Â We reject this rule because it would require trial judges to rule on all admitted evidence in a bench trial. Â A trial judgeâ€™s role in a bench trial is to admit all evidence and then evaluate it in a non-jury setting. Â The [lower courtâ€™s] rule is, therefore, unnecessarily burdensome and would inhibit the trial judgeâ€™s ability to evaluate the evidence and ascertain the truth.\r\n\r\n344 S.C. 21, 27, 542 S.E.2d 723, 726 (2001) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nTherefore, under Brown v. Allstate, the role of the circuit court in this matter was to admit all evidence, admissible or inadmissible, and then evaluate it as the fact finder.Â  The Brown v. Allstate rule does not require the circuit court to make an affirmative statement that it did not rely on the incompetent evidence in rendering its decision.Â  Brown v. Allstate requires only that the circuit court reference the competent evidence it used in reaching its decision in its order.Â  \r\nHere, the circuit court admitted all the evidence, competent and incompetent, introduced at the trial.Â  In its findings of fact, and during the hearing on the motion for reconsideration, the circuit court repeatedly stated that it had not given the speed of the vehicles any weight.Â  The order of the circuit court cited only the competent evidence it relied on in formulating the amount of damages, and under the principle established in Brown v. Allstate, it should be affirmed.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nTherefore, the circuit courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and ANDERSON and KITTREDGE, JJ. concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] Vanover has cited no case to support his claim that declaring property a total loss is in the sole purview of expert testimony.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-234","title":"State v.

Coltrane, Master in Equity and Special Circuit Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-235\r\nSubmitted March 1, 2006 â€“ Filed April 27, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nBruce Robert Hoffman, of St. Helena Island, for Appellant.\r\nThomas Kemmerlin, Jr., of Beaufort, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  We Do Alterations, LLC (Appellant) appeals the trial courtâ€™s order reversing the magistrateâ€™s order of dismissal, remanding the case to the magistrate for disposition of We Do Alterationsâ€™ motion to dismiss, and dismissing the case pending in circuit court.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn November 2003, Appellant filed a breach of contract action in magistrateâ€™s court against Nora Powell and an interference with contract action against Margaretâ€™s Alterations (Respondents).[2] Respondents timely answered and counterclaimed for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Appellant then moved to dismiss the counterclaims under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, which the magistrate denied.Â  Thereafter, Respondents filed amended answers and counterclaims.[3] In July of 2004, Appellant requested the magistrate transfer or dismiss the cases because â€œPlaintiffâ€™s damages in both of the above matters well exceed[ed] the jurisdictional maximum of the Magistrateâ€™s Court, and Plaintiff [has] now filed a consolidated suit, against the same parties on the same grounds, as well as others, in the Court of Common Pleas.â€ One day after the filing of the motion, and without any notice to Respondents, the magistrate dismissed the cases.Â  Â \r\nAppellant then filed its consolidated complaint in circuit court.Â Â  Consequently, Respondents filed a notice of appeal from the magistrateâ€™s order of dismissal, moved to dismiss the circuit court case, and requested an expedited hearing in magistrate court.Â  The magistrate submitted a return to the appeal, admitting error in dismissing the case based on Rule 41(a)(2), SCRCP, which specifically states that an action shall not be dismissed if a counterclaim has been pleaded prior to the service of a motion to dismiss.Â Â Â  The circuit court reversed the magistrateâ€™s order of dismissal, remanded the case back to the magistrate, and dismissed the circuit court case.Â  The circuit court denied Appellantâ€™s motion for reconsideration. This appeal followed.Â Â Â \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellant claims the trial court erred in reversing the magistrateâ€™s order of dismissal and remanding the case to the magistrate because Respondents can show no prejudice by the dismissal.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 41, SCRCP, states \r\n\r\n(1) By Plaintiff; By Stipulation. . . . [A]n action may be dismissed by the plaintiff without order of court (A) by filing and serving a notice of dismissal at any time before service by the adverse party of an answer or motion for summary judgment, whichever first occurs, or (B) by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared in the action. . . .\r\n(2) By Order of Court.Â  Except as provided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision of this rule, an action shall not be dismissed at the plaintiffâ€™s instance save upon order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper.Â  If a counterclaim has been pleaded by a defendant prior to the service upon him of the plaintiffâ€™s motion to dismiss, the action shall not be dismissed against the defendantâ€™s objection unless the counterclaim can remain pending for independent adjudication by the court. . . . \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nRule 41(a)(1) does not apply to this case because We Do Alterations filed the motion to dismiss after Respondents had already answered and counterclaimed. Â Furthermore, Respondents did not agree to the dismissal, as evidenced by their timely appeal.Â Â  Â Â \r\nBecause Rule 41(a)(1) is inapplicable, plaintiffs may only dismiss a case pursuant to an order of the court, as dictated by Rule 41(a)(2).Â  Per Rule 41(a)(2), if a defendant has pled a counterclaim prior to the service upon him of the plaintiffâ€™s motion to dismiss, the magistrate may only grant the motion if the defendants do not object or the counterclaim can be independently adjudicated.Â  Respondents counterclaimed for attorneyâ€™s fees nearly eight months before Appellant filed its motion to dismiss, and the magistrate did not afford Respondents the opportunity to object. This, in itself is prejudicial to Respondents. Therefore, the magistrate erred in granting appellantâ€™s motion. Â Furthermore, Respondents timely filed a notice of appeal from the order of dismissal, and the magistrate admitted the error in his return to the appeal. Therefore, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s reversal of the order of dismissal and remand to the magistrate for reconsideration of Appellantâ€™s motion to dismiss. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nAppellant also claims the trial court erred in dismissing the case pending in circuit court under Rule 12(b)(8), SCRCP, because it did not serve the circuit court complaint on Respondents until after receiving notice of the magistrateâ€™s order of dismissal.Â  We find no error. \r\nÂ Rule 12(b)(8), SCRCP, provides for dismissal of an action when another case is pending between the same parties for the same claim.Â  The trial court remanded the case to magistrate court for disposition of Appellantâ€™sâ€™ motion to transfer or dismiss because the order of dismissal violated Rule 41(a)(2).Â  This action required the trial court to then dismiss the pending circuit court case with the same claims.Â  See Rule 12(b)(8).Â  We find the trial court properly dismissed the circuit court case.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the circuit courtâ€™s order is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, JJ., AND CURETON, A.J., CONCUR.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument, pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.&nbsp;\r\n[2] The Beaufort magistrate court assigned the action against Nora Powell case number 302037 and the action against Margaretâ€™s Alterations case number 302038.Â  The cases were later dismissed per We Do Alterationsâ€™ motion and brought in circuit court as a consolidated case. Â Â For purposes of this appeal, the magistrate court cases will be discussed as one action.Â  \r\n[3] We Do Alterations argues that Respondentsâ€™ amended answers and counterclaims were unauthorized pleadings because they were not filed with leave of the court or permission of We Do Alterations, as required by Rule 15, SCRCP.Â  However, We Do Alterations did not object to the filing, and even appeared to accept them in a handwritten note from counsel for We Do Alterations to Respondentsâ€™ counsel, stating â€œTom, I accept your apology, and likewise regret matters getting out of hand.â€ Nevertheless, We Do Alterationsâ€™ argument regarding the amended answers and counterclaims has no bearing on our decision because the original counterclaims suffice to engage the application of Rule 41(a)(2), SCRCP.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
