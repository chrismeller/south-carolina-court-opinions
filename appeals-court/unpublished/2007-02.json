Morgan, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this declaratory judgment action, Cheri B. Lee appeals the masterâ€™s holding that she was not entitled to recover insurance proceeds under a homeowners policy issued by South Carolina Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company (Farm Bureau) because the fire that damaged the home was intentionally set by Michael Lee, a named co-insured.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThis case was tried on stipulated facts agreed to by the parties, and the salient facts follow.Â  Michael and Cheri Lee resided at 3470 Timberline Drive in Orangeburg (the insured residence).Â  Farm Bureau insured the residence under a homeownerâ€™s policy listing both Michael and Cheri Lee as named insureds.Â  Under the definitions section of the policy, â€œyouâ€ and â€œyourâ€ refer to the â€œnamed insuredâ€ and the spouse, if the spouse is a resident of the same household.Â  The policy contained the following exclusions:\r\n\r\n  We do not insure for loss caused directly or indirectly by any of the following.Â  Such loss is excluded regardless of any other cause or event contributing concurrently or in any sequence to the loss.\r\n  Intentional loss, meaning any loss arising out of any act committed:\r\n  a.&nbsp;&nbsp;By or at the direction of any insureds; or\r\n  b.&nbsp;With the intent to cause a loss; or\r\n  c.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a domestic dispute between insureds, family members, or others\r\n\r\nUnder Conditions, the policy provides as follows:\r\n\r\n  Intentional Loss.Â  If you or any person insured under this policy causes or procures a loss of property covered under this policy for the purpose of obtaining insurance benefits, then the policy is void and we will not pay you or any other insured for this loss.\r\n  Concealment or Fraud.Â  If you or any other insured under this policy has intentionally concealed or misrepresented any material fact of circumstance, or made false statements or engaged in fraudulent conduct relating to this insurance, whether before or after a loss, then this policy is void to you and any other insured.\r\n\r\nOn October 8 and 15, 2001, Mr. Lee intentionally set fire to two homes in the Orangeburg area, neither of which was the insured residence.Â  Then, on November 4, 2001, law enforcement officers observed Mr. Lee intentionally setting fire to the insured residence.Â  Mr. Lee was subsequently arrested in conjunction with all three intentional fires.Â  On November 30, 2001, Mr. Lee was released on bond subject to electronic monitoring.[2] Â While Mr. Lee was out on bond, the insured residence was again intentionally set on fire on December 12, 2001.Â  At the time of this fire, the electronic monitoring devices on Mr. Leeâ€™s leg and in his residence had been tampered with and disabled.Â  Mr. Lee was arrested and charged in connection with this fire.Â  \r\nMr. Lee pled guilty to the intentional fire at the insured residence on November 4, 2001, as well as the two intentional fires in October 2001.Â  As a result of his guilty pleas to the three prior fires, the charge for the December 12, 2001 fire at the insured residence was nolle prossed.Â  Mr. Lee received fifteen years confinement for arson.Â  Farm Bureau admitted Cheri Lee was not involved in the intentional setting of any of Mr. Leeâ€™s fires.Â  \r\nFarm Bureau filed a declaratory judgment action seeking an order from the trial court declaring that Farm Bureau does not owe any proceeds under the insurance policy on the insured residence to either Michael or Cheri Lee.Â  Ms. Lee counterclaimed for coverage under the policy, arguing she was an innocent co-insured.[3]Â  The matter was referred to a master-in-equity who denied coverage to Ms. Lee on the grounds that the policy precluded any recovery because the other named insured, Michael Lee, intentionally set fire to the insured residence on December 12, 2001.Â  Ms. Lee filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion requesting the master to rule on whether Farm Bureau had proven Mr. Leeâ€™s motive in setting the fire of December 12 as required in a civil arson action under Carter v. American Mutual Fire Ins. Co., 297 S.C. 218, 220, 375 S.E.2d 356, 357 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  The master issued an amended order finding, in addition to what was contained in the first order, that even if motive was required, Farm Bureau had met its burden and proved all the elements of civil arson.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nDeclaratory judgment actions are neither legal nor equitable; therefore, the standard of review depends on the nature of the underlying issues. Â Campbell v. Marion County Hosp. Dist., 354 S.C. 274, 279, 580 S.E.2d 163, 165 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  When the purpose of the underlying dispute is to determine whether coverage exists under an insurance policy, the action is one at law. Â Horry County v. Ins. Reserve Fund, 344 S.C. 493, 497, 544 S.E.2d 637, 639-40 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  In an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, findings of fact of the trial judge will not be disturbed on appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.Â  Townes Assoc. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  When an appeal involves stipulated or undisputed facts, an appellate court is free to determine if the trial judge properly applied the law to the facts. Â In re Estate of Boynton, 355 S.C. 299, 301, 584 S.E.2d 154, 155 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  In such a situation, the appellate court does not have to defer to the trial judgeâ€™s findings. Â Id. at 301-02, 584 S.E.2d at 155.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nCheri Lee argues that as an innocent co-insured she was entitled to receive the insurance proceeds from her policy with Farm Bureau.Â  Specifically, she alleges the trial court erred in holding that she was not entitled to recover insurance proceeds because Farm Bureau failed to satisfy the elements of civil arson as set forth in Brown v. Allstate Ins. Co., 344 S.C. 21, 25, 452 S.E.2d 723, 725 (2001), and Carter v. American Mutual Fire Ins. Co., 297 S.C. 218, 220, 375 S.E.2d 356, 357 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  On appeal, Ms. Lee concedes the record contains ample evidence that the fire was of incendiary origin, and that Michael Lee had the opportunity to start the fire of December 12; accordingly, she only contends the trial court erred in finding Farm Bureau established motive.[4]Â  We disagree.\r\nIn this matter, Farm Bureau was not required to prove the motive of Michael Lee because Farm Bureau did not rely on the common law defense of civil arson; rather, Farm Bureau relied on the specific policy exclusion contained in Michael and Cheri Leeâ€™s homeownerâ€™s policy to deny coverage.Â  As a result, the cases relied upon by Ms. Lee are inapplicable to this situation.Â  Brown and Carter only addressed the common law defense of civil arson; neither based a decision upon the insurance policyâ€™s intentional loss exclusion or the fraud and concealment exclusion that Farm Bureau relied upon in this action.[5]Â  \r\nAccordingly, we find South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Kelly, 345 S.C. 232, 547 S.E.2d 871 (Ct. App. 2001), controlling in this matter.Â  In Kelly, the named insuredâ€™s son set a series of three fires at the insured residence causing significant damage to the home.Â  Id. at 235, 547 S.E.2d at 873.Â  Farm Bureau paid over $100,000 in insurance proceeds to the father after the first two fires, but after the third fire, the son admitted to intentionally setting all three fires.Â  Id.Â  Thereafter, Farm Bureau filed an action to recover the proceeds paid to father.Â  Id.Â  The father argued that even though his son was a named insured under the policy the father, as an innocent co-insured, should be allowed to recover under the policy.Â  Id. at 239, 547 S.E.2d at 875.Â  This court relied solely on the policy language to deny coverage to father even though he was an innocent co-insured.Â  Id.Â  The policy in Kelly denied coverage for any act committed by or at the direction of any insured with the intent to cause a loss.Â  It also provided that if a named insured or any person under the policy caused or procured a loss to the property, then the policy was void.Â  The policy also contained a concealment or fraud provision that could void the policy.Â  The language used in the Kelly policy is identical to the language in this action.Â  Therefore, Ms. Leeâ€™s status as an innocent co-insured is immaterial, and the trial court properly found Ms. Lee was not entitled to recover under the Farm Bureau policy on the insured residence.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the order of the trial court finding Cheri Lee is not entitled to any insurance proceeds is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ.,Â  concur,\r\n\r\n[1] Â We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] An electronic transmitter was placed on Mr. Leeâ€™s leg, and an electronic receiver was installed at his current residence.Â  \r\n[3] Mr. Lee neither filed a claim with Farm Bureau for proceeds nor did he counterclaim for coverage.\r\n[4] Our courts have held that in order to deny coverage based on the common law defense of civil arson, an insurance company must prove that the fire was of an incendiary origin, as well as that the party had the opportunity and motive to set the fire.Â  Brown, 344 S.C. at 25, 452 S.E.2d at 725; Carter, 297 S.C. at 220, 375 S.E.2d at 357.Â  \r\n[5] Moreover, even if Farm Bureau relied on the common law defense of civil arson, sufficient evidence of motive exists to support the finding of the trial court.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-052","title":"State v.

Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Deborah R. J. Shupe , all of Columbia; and Solicitor Robert M. Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Steven David Frazier appeals his conviction for involuntary manslaughter, arguing the trial court erred in not giving the full jury charge on proximate cause when the jury requested to hear the charge again. Frazier also contends the trial courtâ€™s recharge was a charge on the facts.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn the evening of November 21, 2001, Greenville County Sheriffâ€™s Deputy Kevin Lewis was dispatched to 35 Emma Street in Greenville, where he met the victim, James Williams.Â  Williams informed Deputy Lewis that he went to the location to visit his ailing aunt.Â  As he approached the house, Frazier, a distant cousin, met him on the porch.Â  Frazier, apparently upset because of some past comment Williams made regarding Frazierâ€™s mother, grabbed and shook Williams, threw him off the porch, and then drove away from the scene. \r\nLewis noticed Williams was visibly upset and had a one-inch bruise on the right side of his head, a cut on his left index finger, and a cut behind his left knee.Â  Williams also complained of soreness in both his left shoulder and ankle and stated he sustained his injuries when he was thrown from the porch.Â  Although an ambulance soon arrived, Williams declined to leave and said he would go to the hospital on his own. \r\nLewis prepared a report of the incident and labeled it as a simple assault and battery.Â  Because Lewis did not see any initial aggravating circumstances, he advised Williams to follow up with the magistrateâ€™s office and gave him the necessary paperwork.\r\nAt the hospital, nurse Nika Fowler examined Williams.Â  Fowler noticed abrasions to Williamsâ€™s chest, posterior, knee, and head.Â  Williams also complained of pain in his left shoulder and right thumb.Â  In her notes, Fowler recorded that Williams weighed 250 pounds, had a prior heart valve replacement, and was taking Lipitor and Coumadin, a blood-thinning medication.Â  The hospital discharged Williams several hours later, and he left without assistance.Â  \r\nOn November 28, Williams complained about excruciating leg pain and had his brother take him to the emergency room.Â  Although Williams did not seem to be doing any better, the hospital released him.Â  \r\nThe next day, Williams, while at home, complained of a severe headache and again asked his brother to take him to the hospital.Â  When the brother arrived at the house, however, Williams could not move because his left leg was numb and ended up calling an ambulance to transport him.Â  At the hospital, doctors discovered Williams had a subdural hemorrhage over the right side of his brain.Â  Williams had surgery to relieve the pressure on his brain, but died December 2, 2001.Â  Dr. Michael Ward, Chief Medical Examiner for Greenville County, opined the cause of death was complications of blunt force trauma to the head, with subdural hemorrhage and cerebral hypoxia.\r\nFrazier was subsequently charged with involuntary manslaughter.Â  At trial, Frazier claimed the doctorsâ€™ gross negligence in failing to earlier diagnose Williamsâ€™s subdural hemotoma was an intervening cause of his death.Â  During the hearing, the defense presented evidence that Williamsâ€™s estate had filed a malpractice suit against the hospital and several members of its medical staff.\r\nThe trial courtâ€™s charge to the jury provided in pertinent part as follows:\r\n\r\n  Now, ladies and gentlemen, our law recognizes that there may be more than one proximate cause.Â  The act of two or more persons may combine and concur together as a proximate cause [of] the death of a person.Â  \r\n  A defendantâ€™s act may be regarded as the proximate cause if it [is] a contributing cause of the death of the deceased.Â  A defendantâ€™s act need not be the sole cause of the death, provided that it be a proximate cause contributing to the death of the deceased.Â  \r\n  I charge you that it is not a defense to show that the deceased might have recovered had he been treated according to the most approved surgical or medical standard or as a reasonably prudent physician would have treated in the case.Â  \r\n  If, however, the death was caused not by the injury that the deceased received, but was caused by erroneous medical care; that is, where the medical treatment was so gross that it was the cause of the death, then this defendant would not be guilty of involuntary manslaughter.Â  \r\n  Ladies and gentlemen, the fact that other causes contributed to the death would not relieve this defendant of responsibility.Â  If the conduct of this defendant contributed mediately or immediately to the death of the alleged victim in this case he would be responsible.Â  \r\n  In other words, the acts or conduct of this defendant must be only a proximate cause of the death.Â  It need not be the direct, immediate or sole cause.Â  It is sufficient if the cause of death resulted naturally from the acts or conduct of this defendant, as, for example, and only for example, where the direct cause of death was a disease, infection or condition caused by or resulting from the conduct of the defendant.Â  Proximate cause means the real cause, the efficient cause, without which the event in question would not have occurred. \r\n\r\nNeither side objected to the trial courtâ€™s initial jury instructions. \r\nDuring deliberations, the jury requested a recharge on â€œcircumstantial evidence and the rule of proximate cause as it relate[d] to the verdict.â€Â  The trial court recharged the jury as follows:\r\n\r\n  With respect to proximate cause, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that other causes contributed to the death of the deceased in this case would not relieve this defendant from responsibility.Â  If his conduct contributed mediately or immediately to the death of the alleged victim, then he would be guilty. \r\n  Â In other words, our law recognizes that there may be more than one proximate cause.Â  The act of two or more persons may combine and concur together as a proximate result of the cause of death of a person.Â  \r\n  Now, the defendantâ€™s act may be regarded as a proximate cause if it is a contributing cause of the death of the decedent.Â  A defendantâ€™s act need not be the sole cause of death, provided, of course, that it be a proximate cause contributing to the death of the decedent.Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial court then asked if the recharge aided the jury in its deliberations, and the jury foreman responded, â€œ[Y]es, sir.â€Â  The trial court then recharged the jury on circumstantial evidence.Â  After the trial court finished, defense counsel objected to the trial courtâ€™s recharge and requested that the trial court re-instruct the jury that â€œas far as that recklessness would relieve someone, would break the chain of proximate cause.â€Â  The trial court declined to charge the jury any further.Â  Counsel also objected unsuccessfully to what he contended was the trial courtâ€™s impermissible comments on the facts during the recharge.\r\nAfter deliberating, the jury convicted Frazier of involuntary manslaughter.Â  This appeal followed.Â  Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  We disagree with Frazierâ€™s argument that, when the jury asked to be recharged on the issue of proximate cause, the trial court erred in refusing to repeat the instruction that if the jury found gross medical negligence caused Williamsâ€™s death, it could conclude that Frazier was not legally responsible. Â \r\nA trial court is required to â€œcharge only the current and correct law of South Carolina.â€[2]Â  A jury charge is deemed correct when the charge, read as a whole, adequately covers the applicable law.[3]Â  When a jury requests an additional charge, the trial court need only charge the parts of the initial charge necessary to answer the juryâ€™s request.[4]Â  Moreover, to warrant a reversal, the trial courtâ€™s â€œrefusal to give a requested charge must be both erroneous and prejudicial.â€[5]Â  \r\nIn the present case, the trial courtâ€™s initial jury charge contained a lengthy explanation of proximate cause.Â  In the charge, the trial court also explained the law regarding intervening medical gross negligence.Â  The charge included instructions that, if the jury found the medical treatment Williams received was â€œso gross that it was the cause of death,â€ Frazier would not be guilty.Â  When the jury requested a recharge, the jury foreman specifically asked only about the â€œrule of proximate causeâ€ and did not ask about intervening medical causation.Â  Furthermore, after the trial courtâ€™s recharge, the trial court asked if the reissued cause charge aided the jury, and the foreman responded in the affirmative.Â  \r\nWe therefore hold the trial courtâ€™s recharge was sufficient.Â  Here, the jury inquired about only proximate cause and, in response to the trial courtâ€™s inquiry, indicated it was satisfied with the recharge. Â In addition, because intervening medical causation was adequately covered by the first charge, we can discern no prejudice to Frazier.[6]Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in failing to recharge the jury on the law regarding intervening medical causation. \r\n2.Â  Next, Frazier argues the trial courtâ€™s recharge on proximate cause amounted to impermissible commentary on the facts of the case. Â Â We disagree.\r\nThe South Carolina Constitution provides, â€œJudges shall not charge the juries in respect to matters of fact, but shall declare the law.â€[7]Â  This provision mandates that the trial court â€œrefrain from all comment which tends to indicate . . . Â opinion as to the weight or sufficiency of evidence, the credibility of witnesses, the guilt of the accused, or as to the controverted facts.â€[8]Â  The rationale behind the constitutional provision is that our justice system is based on the notion that every person charged with a crime has an â€œabsolute right to a fair and impartial trial.â€[9]Â  Fundamental to the concept of a fair and impartial trial is the requirement of neutrality on the part of the trial court.[10]Â  \r\nWe hold the trial court, in recharging the jury, did not comment on the facts of the case.Â  Frazier points to the portion of the trial courtâ€™s recharge that provided as follows: Â â€œNow, the defendantâ€™s act may be regarded as a proximate cause if it is a contributing cause of the death of the decedent.Â  A defendantâ€™s act need not be the sole cause of death, provided . . . that it be a proximate cause contributing to the death of the decedent.â€Â  (emphasis added by Frazier).Â  The recharge does not reference any specific testimony or facts nor did the trial court inject any opinion as to the weight of the evidence against Frazier.Â  The trial court merely recharged the jury with the applicable law regarding proximate cause.Â  Â Accordingly, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s recharge on proximate cause.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  State v.

Â Â We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn June of 1992, Dennyâ€™s purchased a piece of property on Highway 290 in Spartanburg County from the Spartangreen Neighborhood Associates Group (SNAP) for construction and operation of a family style restaurant.Â  As part of this conveyance, SNAP imposed restrictive covenants in favor of Dennyâ€™s on remaining property along or near Highway 290.Â  The Declaration of Restrictive Covenants provided: â€œneither all nor any portion of the Burdened Property shall be used for any â€˜family style or sit-downâ€™ restaurant business.â€Â  The covenants did not prohibit the use of the property as a â€œfast-foodâ€ restaurant, employee cafeteria, vending machine food dispensary, or snack bar operated in connection with a convenience store.Â  \r\nIn January of 2001, J.C. Faw acquired from SNAP and the South Carolina Department of Transportation a 3.2 acre tract, which consisted of aÂ  portion of the burdened property, Parcel F, as well as two unburdened parcels, Parcels A and E.Â  The restricted property, Parcel F is a narrow strip bordering SpartanGreen Boulevard, a two-lane road providing access to Highway 290.Â  Faw subsequently entered into negotiations with Cracker Barrel for sale of the 3.2 acre tract.Â  It is undisputed that Cracker Barrel would build and operate a â€œfamily styleâ€ or â€œsit downâ€ restaurant on Parcels A and E.Â  The only means of access to this restaurant would be across Parcel F to SpartanGreen Boulevard.Â  Dennyâ€™s restaurant is across SpartanGreen Boulevard from the proposed Cracker Barrel restaurant site.Â  Â Â \r\nCracker Barrel was aware of the restriction on Parcel F and recognized that if its title insurance company could not insure over the restricted parcel, it may have a deal breaker situation.Â  In an effort to evade the restriction, Faw and Cracker Barrel attempted to dedicate Parcel F to the County of Spartanburg.Â  The county declined the offer, but the Town of Duncan subsequently agreed to the dedication if the remainder of the property was annexed into the town.[1]Â  \r\nIn March of 2004, Cracker Barrel and Faw executed a real estate sale contract for the property.Â  The contract provided for a reduced acreage due to the proposed dedication to the Town of Duncan.Â  It also required Faw to remove the deed restriction within an allotted time.Â  When Dennyâ€™s learned of Cracker Barrelâ€™s plans, it raised its objections to the development of the restaurant and warned that it would seek legal action if the sales agreement continued. \r\nCracker Barrel brought this declaratory judgment action in February of 2005 asking the court to find the restriction did not prevent Cracker Barrel from constructing its restaurant on the unrestricted property or using the property subject to the restriction in order to access SpartanGreen Boulevard.Â  Dennyâ€™s answered and asserted cross claims again Faw and the Town of Duncan seeking injunctive relief to uphold the restriction as well as actual and punitive damages against Faw.Â  Faw subsequently attempted to terminate the sales contract. \r\nDennyâ€™s filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted.Â  The court noted Cracker Barrel could not operate the proposed restaurant without the use of Parcel F for access and this use violated the restriction.Â  It held deeding the property to the Town of Duncan or any other governmental entity would not eliminate the restriction, and thus would not nullify Cracker Barrelâ€™s prohibited use of the property.Â  In addition, the court found the equities in the case weighed overwhelmingly in favor of enforcing the restriction.Â  Thus, the court enjoined Faw from selling the property to Cracker Barrel, and declared that the deed restriction on Parcel F prohibits the use of the entire tract for a â€œsit downâ€ or family style restaurant.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nCracker Barrel argues the trial court erred in enjoining the property for its restaurant.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAs restrictive covenants are contractual in nature, the paramount rule of construction is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the parties as determined from the whole document.Â  Taylor v. Lindsey, 332 S.C. 1, 4, 498 S.E.2d 862, 863-64 (1998).Â  The court in Taylor elucidated:\r\n\r\n  The court may not limit a restriction in a deed, nor, on the other hand, will a restriction be enlarged or extended by construction or implication beyond the clear meaning of its terms even to accomplish what it may be thought the parties would have desired had a situation which later developed been foreseen by them at the time when the restriction was written.Â Â  It is still the settled rule in this jurisdiction that restrictions as to the use of real estate should be strictly construed and all doubts resolved in favor of free use of the property, subject, however, to the provision that this rule of strict construction should not be applied so as to defeat the plain and obvious purpose of the instrument.Â  \r\n\r\nId.Â  at 4, 498 S.E.2d at 864 (internal quotations and citations omitted).\r\nIn the present case, the language of the restriction is clear and unambiguous.Â  Thus, we must enforce the language of the restriction in accordance with its plain meaning.Â  See Heape v. Broxton, 293 S.C. 343, 345, 360 S.E.2d 157, 158 (Ct. App. 1987) (â€œWhere the language used in a restrictive covenant is unambiguous, there is no room for construction and the language must be enforced in accordance with its plain meaning.â€).\r\nThe Texas Court of Civil Appeals addressed a similar issue in H. E. Butt Grocery Company v. Justice, 484 S.W.2d 628 (Tex. Civ. App. 1972).Â  In that case, a restrictive covenant made for the benefit of HEB prohibited â€œthe use of any portion thereof for the purpose of conducting thereon a food store or food department . . . .â€ Â Id. at 629. Â The plaintiffs sought to sell their land to a developer who would erect a grocery store on land not covered by the restriction but would use land in the restricted tract for parking, ingress, and egress.Â  The Texas court explained the purpose of the restriction â€œwas to prohibit the restricted tract from being used as any necessary part of a competing supermarket with HEB.â€Â  Id. at 630.Â  It found the proposed food store could not be conducted without the use of the restricted area as ingress and egress as well as parking and delivery or groceries to customersâ€™ cars were â€œessential to conducting the proposed food store, and all would take place on the restricted tract.â€ Id. at 630-31.Â  Thus, the court held the proposed use of the restricted tract was violative of the covenant.Â  Id. at 631.\r\nThe Florida District Court of Appeals, relying on the above case, found a restrictive covenant that prohibited the property from being used as a pharmacy prevented a Walgreenâ€™s Pharmacy from using the restricted property for parking, ingress, and egress to the store it sought to build on adjoining, unrestricted property. Eckerd Corp. v. Corners Group, Inc., 786 So.2d 588 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2000).Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nSimilarly, the Colorado Court of Appeals held a restriction imposed by Burger King that provided the premises â€œwill not be used or be permitted to be used directly or indirectlyâ€ for a fast-food restaurant prevented a neighboring McDonaldâ€™s from using the property for parking and access.Â  Sawdey v. Kopas Corp., 495 P.2d 1153 (Colo. Ct. App. 1972).Â  The court found the language of the covenant was clear and unambiguous and forbid â€œthe use of the land for parking and access when such use is an incident to the prohibited use of the landâ€ as a fast-food restaurant.Â  Id. at 1154.Â  \r\nCracker Barrel relies on the Supreme Court of Nevadaâ€™s decision in Nevada Food King, Inc. v. Reno Press Brick Company, 400 P.2d 140 (Nev. 1965). In that case, Nevada Food King leased property for a grocery store and had the following provision included in the lease: â€œLessor shall not lease any property owned by it in that general vicinity for operation of a retail grocery, or meat market, nor shall itself operate the same.â€Â  Id. at 140.Â  The lessor sought to develop a shopping center which would include a supermarket on property adjacent to the property defined as the â€œgeneral vicinityâ€ in the lease.Â  The lessor sought a declaration that the proposed shopping center development would be provided with access through, and parking upon, property located with the â€œgeneral vicinityâ€ area.Â  Id.Â  The court found the covenant was silent as to parking and did not restrict assess to a supermarket located on adjacent property or parking thereon. Id. at 142.Â Â Â  Relying on the maxim â€œexpressio unius est exclusio alteriusâ€ â€“ the expression of one thing excludes others- the court held the restriction did not prohibit parking and access on the property.Â  Id.\r\nIn Nevada Food King, the restriction included the much narrower term â€œoperateâ€.Â  In contrast H. E. Butt and the other cases involved the broader term â€œuseâ€ and held that use of restricted land for access constituted a violation of covenants restricting property from use as certain businesses even though the buildings of the businesses were located on unrestricted properties.Â  We find these cases persuasive.Â  Â Â We hold the use of Parcel F for access to a Cracker Barrel is essential to the prohibited use of the land for a sit-down or family style restaurant.Â  As the trial court found, â€œParcel F would directly benefit the proposed Cracker Barrel restaurant by affording access to it, and would represent an integral and valuable part of the restaurantâ€™s business.â€Â  Such a use violates the plain meaning of the language of the restrictive covenant.Â  Accordingly, we rule the trial court did not err in concluding the restriction prevented Cracker Barrel from operating a â€œsit downâ€ or family style restaurant on Parcels A and/or E as Cracker Barrel would have no alternative but to use Parcel F for access to the restaurant.[2]Â  Â Â Â \r\nCracker Barrel contends that when balancing the equities, the restrictive covenant should not be enforced.Â  \r\n\r\n  The issuance of a mandatory injunction depends upon the equities between the parties, and it rests in the sound judicial discretion of the court whether such an injunction should be granted.Â  Where a great injury will be done to the defendant, with very little if any to the plaintiff, the courts will deny equitable relief.Â  \r\n\r\nHunnicutt v. Rickenbacker, 268 S.C. 511, 515-16, 234 S.E.2d 887, 889 (1977).Â  In Honnicutt, the court reversed a portion of an order that granted a mandatory injunction requiring the removal of a commercial building erected in violation of restrictive covenants.Â  Instead, it allowed the appellants the opportunity to convert the building to residential use to be in compliance with the restrictions.Â  Id. at 517, 234 S.E.2d at 890.Â  \r\nIn the present case, Cracker Barrel has not begun construction of its restaurant or even closed on the property.Â  The damages it would sustain due to enforcement of the restriction would be minimal.Â  In addition, Faw, the present owner of the property, would not be damaged.Â  Barry Bush, Fawâ€™s Director of Real Estate, testified the property was worth more than the $1,330,000 price set forth in the contract with Cracker Barrel.Â  Although Fawâ€™s property could not be used for a â€œfamily styleâ€ restaurant, it could be used for any other type of business.Â  \r\nCracker Barrel asserts the fact that since the restriction was filed the property lost access to Highway 290 pushes the equities substantially in its favor.Â  We disagree.Â  Dennyâ€™s bargained for the restriction to protect its business from similar competition.Â  This restriction included the land fronting SpartanGreen Boulevard known as Parcel F.Â  The proposed Cracker Barrel would be directly across SpartanGreen Boulevard from Dennyâ€™s restaurant with access across the restricted property.Â  Â If Cracker Barrel were allowed to use Parcel F for access, Dennyâ€™s would lose the benefit of the bargain it made when creating the restriction.Â  Cracker Barrel does not contend the restriction against competition is unreasonable and in fact included a similar restriction in its contract with Faw.Â  We agree with the trial court that the equities weigh in favor of enforcing the restriction.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the above stated reasons, the order of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and BEATTY, concur.Â \r\n\r\n[1] On December 14, 2004, Faw executed a deed conveying Parcel F to the Town of Duncan.Â  The deed was not recorded and the Town agreed to give the property back if the Cracker Barrel contract could not close.Â  \r\n[2] Cracker Barrel does not challenge the trial courtâ€™s ruling that deeding the property to the Town of Duncan or any other governmental entity would not eliminate the restriction.Â  Accordingly, that ruling is the law of the case.Â  See Charleston Lumber Co. v. Miller Housing Corp., 338 S.C. 171, 175, 525 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2000) (stating an unappealed ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case and requires affirmance).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-054","title":"Galbreath-Jenkins v.

Fabri, of Charleston, for Appellant.Â  \r\n        Anne Frances Bleecker, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Anne Galbreath-Jenkins (Mother) appeals the family courtâ€™s order finding her in both civil and criminal contempt and failing to find Floyd Ronald Jenkins (Father) in civil contempt.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThe parties were married August 17, 1991 and have one child, born in 2002.Â  The parties separated on June 28, 2003.Â  They entered into a Separate Maintenance and Support Agreement, which was approved by the family court.Â  The agreement discussed custody and visitation and contemplated Motherâ€™s relocation from Charleston to Williamsburg, Virginia, to be near her family.Â  In the spring of 2004, Wife moved from Williamsburg to Orrâ€™s Island, Maine.Â  \r\nIn 2004, the parties began having trouble concerning visitation.Â  Most of the problems stemmed from Motherâ€™s refusal to allow Father overnight visitation with the child.Â  There were numerous instances where Father had traveled to Maine to see the child and was not allowed overnight visitation he believed he was entitled to.Â  \r\nThese disagreements led to Father filing a complaint in September 2004 seeking modification of the custody and visitation provisions of the final order. Â A temporary hearing was set for November 1, 2004.Â  On Fatherâ€™s petition, the family court also issued a rule to show cause ordering Mother to appear and show cause why she should not be held in contempt for failing to allow overnight visitation and for alienating the childâ€™s affections from Father.Â  The hearing was continued by consent.Â  \r\nPrior to the temporary hearing, the parties reached an agreement and submitted an interim order to the court.Â  That order states in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  The attorneys and the parties will use their best efforts to settle all pending issues prior to mediation.Â  If the parties cannot, then they shall attend mediation that must be completed by December 7th.Â  \r\n\r\nMediation was scheduled for December 3, 2004.Â  However, this date was later postponed by agreement because Motherâ€™s counsel had to undergo medical testing.Â  The mediation was rescheduled for February 22, 2005.Â  Mother was made aware of the new mediation date and initially planned to appear by telephone.Â  However, before the mediation date, Mother informed Father she had no obligation to mediate and that she did not plan to participate.Â  Father appeared for the mediation, but Mother was not there.Â  \r\nFather then filed a second petition asking the family court to issue a rule to show cause based on Motherâ€™s failure to attend mediation.Â  The hearing was held on April 21, and May 17 and 18, 2005.Â  The family court held Mother in civil contempt for alienation of affection and for her failure to allow overnight visitation.Â  Mother could either serve ninety days in jail or reimburse Father $8,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees incurred in bringing the action.Â  She was also required to give Father an additional week of summer vacation with the child in 2005.Â  The family court also held Mother in criminal contempt for her failure to appear at the scheduled mediation.Â  She was ordered to pay a $500 fine, which she has done, and attend mediation.Â  The family court did not hold Father in contempt for filing a new action prior to mediation.Â  \r\nMother filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion asserting the family court erred (1) in finding Mother in contempt for denying Father overnight visitation; (2) in finding Mother in willful contempt for removing a picture of Father from the childâ€™s bedroom; (3) in finding Mother in criminal contempt for failing to appear at mediation; (4) in failing to find Father in contempt for failing to seek mediation prior to filing a new action; and (5) in failing to find Father in contempt for his refusal to timely sign a quit claim deed in order to effectuate the closing on the marital home.[2]Â  The motion was denied and this appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family court, the appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 328, 526 S.E.2d 241, 244-45 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  A finding of contempt rests within the sound discretion of the trial court and results from willful disobedience of a court order.Â  Henderson v. Henderson, 298 S.C. 190, 197, 379 S.E.2d 125, 129 (1989).Â  â€œA trial courtâ€™s determination regarding contempt is subject to reversal where it is based on findings that are without evidentiary support or where there has been an abuse of discretion.â€ Â Henderson v. Puckett, 316 S.C. 171, 173, 447 S.E.2d 871, 872 (Ct. App. 1994). Â â€œEven though a party is found to have violated a court order, the question of whether or not to impose sanctions remains a matter for the courtâ€™s discretion.â€ Â Hawkins v. Mullins, 359 S.C. 497, 503, 597 S.E.2d 897, 900 (Ct. App. 2004). Â â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs either when the court is controlled by some error of law or where the order, based upon findings of fact, lacks evidentiary support.â€ Â Townsend v. Townsend, 356 S.C. 70, 73, 587 S.E.2d 118, 119 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nA proceeding and judgment involving criminal contempt is heard on appeal as if from a judgment in a criminal case.Â  In re Moore, 79 S.C. 399, 400, 60 S.E. 947, 947 (1908).Â  In criminal cases, an appellate court reviews errors of law only and is bound by factual findings of the trial court unless clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001); State v. Cutter, 261 S.C. 140, 147, 199 S.E.2d 61, 65 (1973); State v. Butler, 353 S.C. 383, 388, 577 S.E.2d 498, 500 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMother contends the family court erred in finding her in contempt in numerous instances and in failing to find Father in contempt.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nContempt results from a partyâ€™s willful disobedience of a court order.Â  Smith v. Smith, 359 S.C. 393, 396, 597 S.E.2d 188, 189 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œA willful act is one which is â€˜done voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done; that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.â€™â€ Â Widman v. Widman, 348 S.C. 97, 119, 557 S.E.2d 693, 705 (Ct. App. 2001) (quoting Spartanburg County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1988)). Â â€œ[B]efore a court may find a person in contempt, the record must clearly and specifically reflect the contemptuous conduct.â€ Â Widman, 348 S.C. at 119, 557 S.E.2d at 705.\r\nâ€œIn a proceeding for contempt for violation of a court order, the moving party must show the existence of a court order and the facts establishing the respondentâ€™s noncompliance with the order.â€Â  Hawkins, 359 S.C. at 501, 597 S.E.2d at 899.Â  â€œOnce the moving party has made out a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the respondent to establish his or her defense and inability to comply with the order.â€Â  Widman, 348 S.C. at 120, 557 S.E.2d at 705.Â  Furthermore, it is generally recognized that where a contemnor is unable, without fault on his part, to obey a court order, he is not to be held in contempt.Â  Hicks v. Hicks, 280 S.C. 378, 381, 312 S.E.2d 598, 599 (Ct. App. 1984). \r\nThe instant case involves both civil and criminal contempt.Â  â€œThe purpose of civil contempt is â€˜to coerce the defendant to do the thing required by the order for the benefit of the complainant.â€™â€Â  Poston v. Poston, 331 S.C. 106, 111, 502 S.E.2d 86, 88 (1998).Â  Civil contempt must by proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Id. at 113, 502 S.E.2d at 89.Â  The primary purposes of criminal contempt, on the other hand, are to preserve the courtâ€™s authority and to punish the disobedience of its orders.Â  Id. at 111, 502 S.E.2d at 88 (citing State v. Bevilacqua, 316 S.C. 122, 128, 447 S.E.2d 213, 217 (Ct. App. 1994)).Â  Criminal contempt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Id. at 113, 502 S.E.2d at 89.\r\nI.Â Â Failure to Allow Overnight Visitation \r\nMother contends the family court erred in finding her in civil contempt for failing to allow Father overnight visitation with the child. Â We disagree.Â  \r\nThe agreement contains numerous provisions regarding visitation with the child.Â  Section Twelve, Paragraph (a) of the agreement provides that â€œ[u]ntil [the child] reaches the age of three (3) years old, Husband/Father will have unlimited, unsupervised visitation time with [the child].Â  This time will be spent in Williamsburg, Virginia and [the child] will not be spending overnights with Husband/Father.â€Â  However, immediately following that paragraph, the agreement states: \r\n\r\n  (b) In addition to the unrestricted visitation as referenced above in paragraph (a), Husband/Father shall have visitation with [the child] for six (6), eight (8) hour periods, being solely responsible for [the child]â€™s supervision for these . . . [visits], to occur over a six (6) month period. . . .Â  After six (6) months and the six (6), eight (8) hour periods are accomplished by Husband/Father, Husband/Father shall then, in addition to the unrestricted visitation as set forth above in paragraph (a), Husband/Father shall be entitled to one (1) weekend of overnight visitation per month.Â  \r\n\r\nThis paragraph is followed by the statement that â€œ[u]pon [the child] reaching her second (2nd) birthday, Husband/Father will be entitled to seven (7) consecutive overnight days per year with [the child], so long as the prior visitation has gone well and [the child] is demonstrably happy with [Husband/Father]â€™s visitation.â€Â  \r\nAlthough Paragraph (a) standing alone would seem to prevent overnight visitation by Father until the child is three, it can also be interpreted to mean that when the child attains age three, Father would be entitled to overnight visitation even if he does not meet the requirements set out in the following paragraphs.Â  Paragraphs (b) and (c) set forth conditions whereby Father can enjoy overnight visitation in addition to those he would be entitled to if he merely waited until the child attained age three.Â  Once Father complied with those conditions, he was entitled to overnight visitation prior to the child reaching age three.Â  The family court considered the provisions of the agreement and found Father had clearly met his overnight visitation requirement by July of 2004. Â See Browning v. Browning, 366 S.C. 255, 264, 621 S.E.2d 389, 393 (Ct. App. 2005) (â€œWhen parties merge their settlement agreement into a decree, the family court transforms it from a contract between the parties to a decree of the court.Â  Thereafter, the agreement, as part of the court order, is fully subject to the family courtâ€™s authority to interpret and enforce its own decrees.â€) (internal citations omitted).Â  There is no dispute that Father visited the child at least once per month beginning in November of 2003.Â  It seems apparent from the record that Mother was not complying with the spirit of the agreement or with the specific provisions allowing visitation once the conditions outlined had been met.Â  \r\nThough Mother contends Father had not met his requirements, much of her argument is based on her belief that the final order approving the October&nbsp;29, 2003 agreement was not signed until March of 2004, and consequently, the â€œsix monthsâ€ would not have begun until then.Â  However, though the order was not signed until March 26, 2004, it was made effective nunc pro tunc to December 19, 2003.Â  \r\nMother further argues the family court incorrectly placed the burden on her to show that Father had not met the time requirements.Â  This was not in error as a prima facie case of contempt had already been made and the burden then shifted to Mother.Â  See Widman, 348 S.C. at 120, 557 S.E.2d at 705 (â€œOnce the moving party has made out a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the respondent to establish his or her defense and inability to comply with the order.â€).Â  Furthermore, because the family court was in a better position to judge the witnessesâ€™ demeanor and credibility, its findings should be given broad discretion.Â  Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003).Â  Accordingly, the family court did not err in finding Mother in civil contempt for failure to allow overnight visitation.Â  \r\nII.Â Â Conduct Engaged to Undermine the Childâ€™s Affection and Respect for Husband \r\nMother contends the family court erred in finding her in contempt for undermining the childâ€™s affection and respect for Father.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe agreement states, in relevant part: \r\n\r\n  The parents further agree that they will consult with each other and cooperate in making decisions regarding [the child], and that neither of them shall do or say anything to [the child] or within her hearing, directly or indirectly, to undermine [the child]â€™s affection and respect for the other parent.Â  Each parent agrees to speak to each other and of each other in a respectful manner at all times, especially in front of [the child] and will insist and to the extent possible ensure that friends and family members abide by this strict rule as well.Â  \r\n\r\nThe family court found Mother in contempt for undermining the childâ€™s affection and respect for Father for numerous reasons including denying overnight visitation, in yelling at him in front of the child, and in taking Fatherâ€™s photograph out of the childâ€™s room.Â  \r\nThe family court specifically found, and we agree, the yelling incident, standing alone, is probably not sufficient to trigger a citation of contempt.Â  However, that coupled with the numerous other instances of Motherâ€™s behavior, is enough to find her in civil contempt.Â  Accordingly, the family courtâ€™s holding of civil contempt was not erroneous.Â  \r\nIII.Â Â Failure to Attend Mediation \r\nMother contends the family court erred in finding her in criminal contempt for not attending the February 22, 2005 mediation.Â  Father argues Mother has waived her right to appeal this issue by paying the fine ordered by the family court.Â  We agree and find the appeal of that issue is waived.Â  See Chappell v. Chappell, 282 S.C. 376, 377-78, 318 S.E.2d 590, 591 (Ct. App. 1984) (holding that father, who paid contempt fine for â€œinterfer[ing] with the due administration of justiceâ€ by attempting to pay child support arrearages to clerk in loose change, waived right to appeal).Â  \r\nIV.Â Â Failure to Seek Mediation Before Filing of New Action \r\nMother contends the family court erred in refusing to find Father in contempt when he filed a new action in family court without first seeking formal mediation.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe agreement states in pertinent part: \r\n\r\n  Both parties agree that should problems, issues or concerns arise they will first seek the advice of a child psychologist/therapist, return to mediation and upon last resort return to the Family Court to resolve the visitation issues related to the child.Â  \r\n\r\nand further states: \r\n\r\n  The parties agree that if any disagreement should arise concerning this Agreement that cannot be settled directly between themselves by negotiation, they will first attempt in good faith to mediate the dispute with the services of a professional mediator of mutual choice.Â  \r\n\r\nHowever, the agreement does not state that a party cannot file an action prior to mediation.Â  The agreement states that the parties shall return to family court only as a last resort.Â  Fatherâ€™s action raised the issues and prompted the mediation process.Â  So although Father did file an action, the result of that filing was that mediation was set as contemplated by the agreement.Â  Accordingly, we find no error in the family courtâ€™s ruling finding Father was not in contempt for filing his action.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] This issue is not raised on appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-055","title":"State v.

King, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-055\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2007 â€“ Filed February 8, 2007\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Chief Attorney Joseph L. Savitz III, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliot, Assistant Attorney General Deborah R.J. Shupe, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Cecil Kelly Jackson, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Appellant argues the trial judge erred by refusing to issue the jury an additional charge with regard to reasonable doubt as part of a supplemental Allen charge, when reasonable doubt had already been explained to the jury in the initial charge.Â  We affirm. [1]\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant Melvin Douglas Woods (â€œWoodsâ€) was indicted on a charge of second-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor, his eleven-year-old step-daughter (â€œVictimâ€).Â  After mistrials in March and October 2004, the case was called for a third jury trial on February 7, 2005.\r\nThe trial court gave a thorough and unchallenged jury instruction that included an explanation of the â€œreasonable doubtâ€ standard.Â  After deliberating, the jury sent a note to the court requesting a copy of the court record, and after further deliberations (amounting to a total of approximately two hours), a second note stating they were unable to reach a verdict. Â Â The court then gave the jury an Allen charge pursuant to Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 492 (1896).Â  As part of this charge, the trial court concluded by stating:\r\n\r\n  [I]f I can give you any help on the law, that is if you like any further definition of any of the matters of law which I have explained to you, be they reasonable doubt . . . or any legal questions whatsoever, I would be glad to try to clarify the law . . . if that will assist in your decision.Â Â  \r\n\r\nAfter the charge had been completed and the jury exited, defense counsel requested that the charge of reasonable doubt be given again to the jury.Â  The trial judge refused, stating he believed that would â€œput too much emphasis on the reasonable doubt . . . I told them if they wanted any more instruction on any issue of law, Iâ€™ll give it to them, but they havenâ€™t requested that, so Iâ€™m going to respectfully decline to do that.â€Â  \r\nThe jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the trial court sentenced defendant.Â  This appeal follows.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA trial court is required to charge the current and correct law.Â  Stokes v. Spartanburg Regâ€™l Med. Ctr.,&nbsp; 368 S.C. 515, 520, 629 S.E.2d 675, 678&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).Â Â  Where a request to charge is timely made and involves a controlling legal principle, a refusal by the trial judge to charge the request constitutes reversible error.Â  Koutsogiannis v. BB&amp;T,&nbsp; 365 S.C. 145, 149, 616 S.E.2d 425, 427-28 (2005). To warrant reversal, the refusal to give a requested charge must have been erroneous and prejudicial.Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWe find the case of Orton v. United States, 221 F.2d 632 (4th Cir. 1955) instructive.Â  In Orton, the defendants were convicted after an initial charge that explained reasonable doubt and a subsequent, supplemental Allen charge that did not include any further explication of reasonable doubt.Â  Defendants appealed, arguing in part that the supplemental charge was in error because it did not include a repetition of the initial charge on presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt.Â Â  The circuit court of appeals affirmed the district court:\r\n\r\n  [W]e think [the trial court] could very well assume that the jury had in mind instructions which he had given only an hour and a half before. Â Jurors should be given credit for having ordinary intelligence; and if there is one doctrine of the criminal law which they probably understand better than any other it is the presumption of innocence and the burden resting upon the prosecution to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Nothing said in the supplemental charge had any tendency to becloud this doctrine and there was no reason to repeat what had been said plainly with regard thereto.\r\n\r\nOrton at 635-36.\r\nThe same is true here.Â  The supplemental charge here was given approximately two hours after the initial charge. Â Â The original charge included an explanation of reasonable doubt.Â  The supplemental charge included a statement that the judge would be happy to offer the jury â€œany further definition of any of the matters of law which I have explained to you, be they reasonable doubtÂ  . . . or any legal questions whatsoever, I would be glad to try to clarify the law [for] you[.]â€Â  Nothing said in the supplemental charge had any tendency to confuse the jurors with respect to the law of reasonable doubt.Â  We find no error, and the judgment of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J, and KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-056","title":"Tennant v.

Coltrane, Master In Equity\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-056\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2007 â€“ Filed February 8, 2007Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        James H. Moss, of Beaufort, for Appellant.\r\n        Andrew D. Smith, of Mt. Pleasant, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â During the fall of 2001, Marsha Tennant was employed as a special education teacher in the Beaufort County School District.Â  Tennant, along with her aides Yolanda Hamilton and Ieeia Grimes-Singleton, taught ten emotionally disturbed students at Ladyâ€™s Island Middle School.Â  As the 2001 school year progressed, Tennant became concerned that her aides were not performing their jobs in a satisfactory manner.Â  Tennant worried that her aidesâ€™ poor performance could impact upon her studentsâ€™ welfare and result in violations of federal guidelines for her studentsâ€™ individualized education programs.Â  \r\nOn the morning of October 18, 2001, Tennant felt physically ill after an argument with Hamilton.Â  Tennant sought the medical advice of Karen Williams, the school nurse. Â Williams checked Tennantâ€™s blood pressure and recorded it at an elevated 158/98.Â  Tennant left the nurseâ€™s station briefly to go to the main office and returned to see Williams approximately twenty minutes later.Â  Upon her return, Tennant complained of dizziness, sweating, chest pain, and neck pain.Â  Williams observed that Tennantâ€™s breathing was labored and called EMS out of fear that Tennant had suffered a heart attack.\r\nEmergency medical personnel transported Tennant to Beaufort Memorial Hospital by ambulance and measured Tennantâ€™s blood pressure to be 178/108.Â  Tennantâ€™s treating physician at the hospital, Dr. Saeed Rehman, assessed Tennantâ€™s experience as a â€œstress reaction.â€Â  Dr. Andrea Hucks, Tennantâ€™s family physician, theorized that Tennant suffered a â€œpanic attackâ€ based on her reported symptoms and diagnosed Tennant with â€œsituational depression and panic disorder.â€Â  Additionally, Tennant was examined by Dr. Dyana Lowndes-Rosen, a licensed practicing psychologist.Â  Lowndes-Rosen determined Tennant suffered a single anxiety attack, and in her medical opinion felt Tennant did not require additional treatment or medications and could return to work because there was no resulting psychological disability from the anxiety attack.Â  Tennant later came under the care of Kathryn Jacobson, who has a bachelorâ€™s degree in sociology and psychology and a masterâ€™s degree in social work.Â  Jacobson diagnosed Tennant with post-traumatic stress disorder and believed, as of her deposition on May 27, 2002, that Tennant could not return to the classroom in the near future.Â  Tennant did not return to work at Ladyâ€™s Island Middle School following the incident, opting instead to work from home from August of 2002 for the University of South Carolina on a part-time basis.Â  \r\nTennant filed a workersâ€™ compensation claim alleging injuries to her â€œbrain and body.â€Â  After a hearing on October 10, 2002, the single commissioner issued an order on September 19, 2003 denying Tennantâ€™s claim.Â  The single commissioner found the greater weight of the evidence did not support Tennantâ€™s assertions that she sustained an injury in the course of her employment or that the conditions of her employment were either unusual or extraordinary.Â  An appellate panel of the workersâ€™ compensation commission, in its order dated May 17, 2004, affirmed the single commissionerâ€™s order, but also included in the record Jacobsonâ€™s previously excluded testimony and considered the testimony on the issue of causation.Â  The circuit court, by its order dated July 5, 2005, affirmed the appellate panelâ€™s ruling.Â  Tennant appeals.Â  \r\n1.Â Â Tennant argues the circuit court erred by not considering the opinions of Jacobson and Hucks.Â  The single commissionerâ€™s order stated as follows: â€œGreater weight was given to the opinion of Dr. Dyana Lowndes-Rosen versus Dr. Andrea D. Hucks and Kathryn Jacobson.Â  Dr. Lowndes-Rosen is a licensed practicing psychologist, while Dr. Hucks practices internal medicine.â€Â  Although the single commissioner did not feel Jacobson qualified to render an opinion on causation, the appellate panel made Jacobsonâ€™s deposition part of the record and stated â€œ[a]lthough records which were excluded by the hearing commissioner are allowed in by this panel and considered, the end result is the same.â€Â  The circuit court concluded, and we agree, that the appellate panel considered Jacobsonâ€™s testimony but chose to give it no weight.Â  See Stone v. Traylor Brothers, Inc., 360 S.C. 271, 274, 600 S.E.2d 551, 552 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œIn an appeal from the Commission, neither this court nor the circuit court may substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact . . . .â€).\r\n2.Â Â Tennant next argues the circuit court erred in not finding that substantial evidence in the record supported a finding of unusual strain and exertion which allegedly caused Tennantâ€™s injury and subsequent disability.Â  Tennant also argues the circuit court erred in finding against her where substantial evidence in the record established that Tennantâ€™s alleged injury stemmed from an unusual or extraordinary condition at her workplace.Â  The circuit court, in finding substantial evidence existed in the record to support the appellate panelâ€™s ruling, specifically noted that 1) Tennantâ€™s position, Â teaching children who suffered from a wide range of problems, placed her in a naturally stressful environment, and noted specific instances of abnormal behavior from several of Tennantâ€™s students; 2) Topeeza Tillman, Tennantâ€™s direct supervisor, testified that conflicts like the one between Tennant and her aides were not unusual or extraordinary; 3) Beaufort County School District ultimately addressed Tennantâ€™s complaints and removed the aides from the classroom; 4) Jacobson conceded that a panic attack can be triggered without an unusual or extraordinary circumstance; and 5) Lowndes-Rosen determined Tennant suffered a single anxiety attack with no resulting psychological disability.Â  We agree with the circuit court that substantial evidence exists in the record to support the appellate panelâ€™s finding that Tennant did not suffer a compensable injury.Â  Because there is substantial evidence to support the appellate panelâ€™s ruling, we affirm.Â  See Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000) (â€œThe final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the Full Commission.â€); Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 136, 276 S.E.2d 304, 307 (1981) (â€œ[T]he possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [the Commissionâ€™s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.â€); Etheredge v. Monsanto Co., 349 S.C. 451, 455, 562 S.E.2d 679, 681 (Ct. App. 2002) (â€œWhere there are conflicts in the evidence over a factual issue, the findings of the Commission are conclusive.â€).\r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nGOOLSBY, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-057","title":"State v.

Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General Shawn L. Reeves, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Barbara R. Morgan, of Aiken; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Melvin Rhodes appeals from his conviction of shoplifting, third or greater offense.Â  He argues the trial judge erred in failing to order a mental evaluation to determine whether Rhodes was competent to stand trial.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn February 5, 2005, a customer at the Dollar General Store in North Augusta observed Rhodes leave the store with merchandise in his pants.Â  The customer, who happened to be an off-duty police officer, followed Rhodes out of the store, and spoke with Rhodes about the merchandise.Â Â  The police were called, and Rhodes was arrested for shoplifting.Â  Upon searching Rhodes, officers found seven packs of menâ€™s boxer shorts, two packs of menâ€™s T-shirts, and a set of sheets.Â  \r\nThe day before trial, Rhodes requested a mental evaluation to determine his capacity to stand trial.Â  Rhodes claimed he suffered from schizophrenia and depression, for which he took medication.Â  The trial judge engaged in a colloquy with Rhodes.Â  During this conversation, Rhodes admitted that he had been in court before, that he had been evaluated before, and that he spoke with his attorney about his mental condition.Â  Rhodes was also able to answer the trial judgeâ€™s questions regarding his age, the medications he was taking, and the length of time he had been in jail.Â  After engaging in this conversation with Rhodes, the trial judge denied Rhodesâ€™ request for a mental evaluation. \r\nRhodes was convicted of shoplifting, third or greater offense.Â  He was sentenced to ten yearsâ€™ imprisonment.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nRhodes argues the trial judge erred in failing to order a mental evaluation to determine whether Rhodes was competent to stand trial.Â  We disagree.\r\nPursuant to section 44-23-410 of the South Carolina Code (2002), a trial judge must order a mental evaluation when the judge â€œhas reason to believeâ€ that the defendant is not mentally competent to stand trial.Â  Thus, the decision to order a mental evaluation is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge, who was able to observe the defendant and evaluate the facts presented on the question of competency.\r\nÂ State v. White, 364 S.C. 143, 147, 611 S.E.2d 927, 929 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Because the determination is left to the trial judgeâ€™s discretion, it will not be overturned absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion.Â \r\nId.\r\nâ€œThe established test in South Carolina for determining a defendantâ€™s competency to stand trial is whether the defendant has the present ability to consult with his attorney with a reasonable degree of rational understanding.â€Â  Sims v. State, 313 S.C. 420, 422, 438 S.E.2d 253, 254 (1993).Â  Here, the trial judge engaged Rhodes in a conversation, and during that conversation, Rhodes demonstrated his ability to understand and respond to questions.Â  Rhodes also admitted to speaking with his attorney about his mental health problems and his case in general, thereby demonstrating his ability to consult with his attorney.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by refusing to order a mental evaluation.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, Rhodesâ€™ conviction for shoplifting, third or greater offense, is\r\n AFFIRMED.  \r\n HEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215(a), SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-060","title":"State v.

Hopkins, Jr., of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nMarvin E. McMillan, Jr., of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Appellant Rhett Munn appeals the master-in-equityâ€™s refusal to grant Munnâ€™s motion to dismiss and holding that Munn is personally liable for unpaid invoices from J.H. Seale &amp; Son, Inc. for petroleum.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nJay Richardson, an officer of J. H. Seale &amp; Son, Inc., contacted his long term friend, Munn, about purchasing petroleum from J.H. Seale for convenience stores known as Munn-E-Saver. Â J.H. Seale and Munn began doing business together in April of 1995 without a written agreement. Â J.H. Seale billed Carolina Entertainment for the petroleum at Munnâ€™s request.[2]Â  On August 4, 1995, Munnâ€™s close corporation Carolina Music Company, Inc., changed its name to Carolina Entertainment, Inc. \r\nJ.H. Seale brought this action on June 27, 2001 to collect payment for five unpaid invoices totaling $28,251.00. Â Munn moved to be dismissed from the action and for Carolina Entertainment, Inc. to be substituted as the defendant.Â  After a trial, the master denied Munnâ€™s motion to dismiss and found Munn personally liable to Seale for $18,451.92.[3]Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Motion to dismiss \r\nMunn argues the master erred in denying his motion to dismiss Munn individually because the master did not review the pleadings and Munn was not individually liable to Seale.Â  We disagree.\r\nMunn asserts the master should have granted his motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP. Â Under this rule, the trial court may dismiss a claim when the defendant demonstrates the plaintiff has failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action in the pleadings filed with the court.Â  Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, Williams v. Condon, 347 S.C. 227, 232-33, 553 S.E.2d 496, 499 (Ct. App. 2001)Â  Â â€œA motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) should not be granted if facts alleged and inferences reasonably deducible therefrom would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory of the case.â€Â Â  Flateau v. Harrelson, 355 S.C. 197, 202, 584 S.E.2d 413, 415 (Ct. App. 2003) The ruling on the motion to dismiss must be solely based on the allegations in the complaint. Stiles v. Onorato, 318 S.C. 297, 300, 457 S.E.2d 601, 602 (1995). \r\nIn this case, Seale contends in his complaint that Munn is individually liable for goods and services â€œprovided at the request of Defendant and for which the Defendants promised to pay.â€ Â The complaint lists â€œRhett Munn, individually and Rhett Munn, d/b/a Carolina Entertainmentâ€ as the only defendants.Â  The complaint implicates Munn individually for promising to pay.Â  Thus the complaint contains a theory of recovery against Munn, which prevents the granting of the motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).Â  \r\nAdditionally, Munn argues that the master did not review the pleadings.Â  During the hearing the master stated that the Clerkâ€™s case file had been misplaced. Â Counsel for Seale provided the pleadings to the master for the hearing.Â  Counsel for Munn stated that he did not have a problem with Sealeâ€™s attorney providing the documents to the master. Â Munn never made any objection concerning the missing file.Â  Thus, we find Munnâ€™s argument is not preserved for our review. See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).Â  \r\nAlthough Munn insists his motion was only one to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), he cites evidence presented at the hearing to support his argument that the master erred in holding him individually liable.Â  We find no error in the masterâ€™s ruling.Â  \r\nThis is an action at law.Â  See Sterling Dev. Co. v. Collins, 309 S.C. 237, 240, 421 S.E.2d 402, 404 (1992) (â€œAn action for breach of contract seeking money damages is an action at law.â€)Â  In an action at law tried without a jury, the trial courtâ€™s factual findings will not be disturbed on appeal unless those findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence or controlled by error of law.Â  Gordon v. Colonial Ins. Co. of Ca., 342 S.C. 152, 155, 536 S.E.2d 376, 378 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nâ€œCommon law, as reflected in the law of agency, requires that one who claims to be acting in a corporate capacity (thereby avoiding individual liability) must disclose that he or she is acting as an agent for the corporation rather than as an individual.â€Â  F. Lodge Oâ€™Neal &amp; Robert B. Thompson, Â Oâ€™Neal and Thompsonâ€™s Close Corporations and LLCâ€™s: Law and Practice Â§8:9 (2004).Â Â  â€œThe burden is on the one claiming the agency relationship to prove that such disclosure took place.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nThis court has found individuals responsible for a debt when they failed to disclose they were acting on behalf of a corporation.Â  Mail Mart, Inc. v. Action Mktg. Consultants, Inc., 281 S.C. 167, 314 S.E.2d 351 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  In Mail Mart, the plaintiff alleged in its complaint that it provided individual defendants, Lewis and Edwards, advertising services pursuant to an oral contract.Â  Id. at 168, 314 S.E.2d at 352.Â  In their answer, Lewis and Edwards denied that they, as individuals, contracted with the plaintiff and affirmatively alleged that â€œany dealings that they had with the plaintiff were done as agents and employees of Action Marketing.â€Â  Id.Â  Â The president of the plaintiff testified he met with Lewis and Edwards at the Atlanta Airport sometime in August 1979 and entered into a marketing contract with them.Â  Id.Â  He further testified that he believed that his negotiations were with Lewis and Edwards alone.Â  Id.Â  At no time, he said, did they purport to represent Action Marketing or any other corporation.Â  Mail Mart, 281 S.C. at 168, 314 S.E.2d at 352.Â  The jury found in favor of the plaintiff against Lewis and Edwards individually.Â  Id. at 169, 314 S.E.2d at 363.Â  This court affirmed, finding the verdict was â€œclearly supported by the evidence.â€Â  Id. at 170, 314 S.E.2d at 363.Â  Â Â \r\nLike the plaintiff in Mail Mart, Jay Richardson, an officer with J.H. Seale, testified that he was unaware that Munn was acting on behalf of a corporation when they entered into an agreement for J.H. Seale to provide Munn petroleum.Â  Richardson acknowledged that he was aware Munn was involved with a corporation known as Carolina Music Company, Inc.Â  However, Munn directed J.H. Seale to bill the invoices not to Carolina Music Company, Inc. but to Carolina Entertainment.Â  Carolina Music Company, Inc. did not change its name to Carolina Entertainment, Inc. until four months after Richardson and Munn made their agreement.Â  Thus, at the time the agreement was made, no corporation with the name Carolina Entertainment, Inc. even existed.Â  Richardson maintained no one ever told him that Carolina Entertainment was a separate legal entity or a corporation.Â  He asserted that if he had known Carolina Entertainment was a corporation, he would have asked for a personal guarantee from Munn.Â  He claimed he expected payment from Munn.Â  He stated he never knew Munnâ€™s position, that Carolina Entertainment was the party responsible for the debt, until this lawsuit was filed.Â  \r\nMunn asserts the payment of invoices with checks written on Carolina Entertainmentâ€™s account signed by J.B. Brown evidences J.H. Sealeâ€™s knowledge of the corporation.Â  However, the payment of bills using corporate checks is not sufficient to disclose the agency relationship.Â  Oâ€™Neal &amp; Thompson, at Â§8:9.Â Â  \r\nMunn also calls the courtâ€™s attention to the fact that the invoices for which J.H. Seale seeks payments were dated over five years after the parties began doing business and the Articles of Amendment were filed with the Secretary of State reflecting the name change from Carolina Music Co., Inc. to Carolina Entertainment, Inc.Â  Munn states, â€œCarolina Entertainment, Inc. was a valid South Carolina corporation as of July 15, 1995 . . . .â€Â  The business agreement between J.H. Seale and Munn, however, began in April of 1995, four months before the name change.Â  Munn acknowledged he never sent out any written notice to his customers or vendors concerning the name change nor could he specifically recall telling anyone from J.H. Seale about the change.\r\nMunn did testify that he told Richardson to bill Carolina Entertainment, Inc. rather than just â€œCarolina Entertainment.â€Â  Although Munn presented evidence contradicting that of J.H. Seale, this court may not re-weigh the evidence but must only determine whether there is evidence supporting the masterâ€™s ruling. Kiriakides v. Atlas Food Sys. &amp; Serv. Inc., 343 S.C. 587, 594, 541 S.E.2d 257, 261 (2001).Â  Accordingly, as we find evidence in the record to support the masterâ€™s ruling that Munn was individually liable, we must affirm.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Piercing the Corporate Veil \r\nMunn argues the master erred in holding him personally liable for the unpaid invoices because the master did not conduct a piercing the corporate veil analysis.Â  This issue was neither raised to nor ruled upon by the master.Â  Therefore, it is not properly before this court.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).\r\nFurthermore, there was simply no veil to be pierced.Â  The master held Munn directly liable for the invoices based on his actions rather than under a theory of piercing the corporate veil.Â  We find no error.Â  Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the masterâ€™s decision is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n ANDERSON, HUFF, and BEATTY, concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Four of the five invoices in the record have â€œCarolina Entertainmentâ€ listed as the purchaser.Â  The other invoice has the purchaser listed as â€œCarolina Entertainment Company.â€\r\n[3]  This amount of the debt was decreased to $18,451.92 due to payments previously made. Â The amount of the debt is not in dispute on appeal.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-062","title":"Citifinancial Mortgage v.

Laney and Nikole D. Haltiwanger, both of Columbia, for Respondent. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Emma Kennedy appeals the special refereeâ€™s decision upholding a default judgment in favor of Citifinancial Mortgage Company, Inc. (Bank) which resulted in the foreclosure of her home.Â  Kennedy contends that she was not afforded service of process in accordance with Rule 4(d), SCRCP.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn December 4, 2004, Bank filed a foreclosure action against Kennedy for her property located at 424 Lyerly Street in Lake City, South Carolina.Â  On February 5, 2005, Constable Walter Phillips delivered the amended summons and complaint to Kennedyâ€™s residence, and Carrol Gray accepted delivery.Â  In his affidavit of service, Phillips noted that Gray, a sixty-five-year-old male, lived at the residence.Â Â Â  \r\nNo response to the summons and complaint was ever submitted, and on June 2, 2005, the special referee held a hearing and entered a default judgment against Kennedy ordering the property sold at public auction.[2]Â  On October 26, 2005, the special referee awarded a deed to the public auctionâ€™s highest bidder.Â Â Â  \r\nOn November 3, 2005, Kennedy filed a Rule 60(b), SCRCP, motion to vacate the special refereeâ€™s default judgment and the sale of the property on the grounds that she was not served process.Â  On November 23, 2005, the special referee held a hearing and denied Kennedyâ€™s motion.Â  The order was filed on November 30, 2005, and written notice of entry of the order was mailed to Kennedy on December 5, 2005.Â  \r\nKennedy filed a second Rule 60(b) motion on November 30, 2005, and by order dated December 30, 2005, this motion was denied.Â  During the December 15, 2005 hearing on this motion, Carrol Gray testified that he stayed at the residence a few days a week and accepted service on behalf of Kennedy.[3]Â  Gray went on to testify that he presented Kennedy with the summons and complaint the following day.Â  Kennedy admitted to receiving the summons and complaint, and she further testified that she brought this process to a lawyer within the thirty day period within which she was required to respond.Â  \r\nOn January 11, 2006, Kennedy filed her notice of appeal referencing only the special refereeâ€™s December 30, 2005 order and not the November 30, 2005 order denying the initial Rule 60 motion to set aside the default judgment.Â  Accordingly, Kennedy notes only when she received written notice of the December thirtieth order and not the date she received written notice of the November thirtieth order.Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nKennedy attempts to appeal from the December 30, 2005 order denying her second Rule 60(b) motion.Â  There are many procedural and, ultimately, jurisdictional problems with this request.Â  In an abundance of caution and with a desire for procedural leniency with pro se litigants within the bounds of the law, we will entertain an analysis which explores all possible avenues.\r\nFirst, we must note that Rule 203(b)(1), SCACR, requires an appellant to serve a written notice of appeal to all respondents within thirty days after receipt of written notice of entry of the order or judgment.[4]Â  Because the requirement of service of notice of appeal is jurisdictional, failure to meet this deadline deprives this court of the ability to consider the appeal.Â \r\nElam v. S.C. Dept. of Transportation, 361 S.C. 9, 14-15, 602 S.E.2d 772, 775 (2004).Â  This court has â€œno authority or discretion to â€˜rescueâ€™ the delinquent party by extending or ignoring the deadline for service of the notice.â€Â  Id.Â  Â \r\nBank asserts that Kennedyâ€™s notice of appeal (NOA) was filed fifty days after the special refereeâ€™s November 23, 2005 order (the order was actually filed on November 30, 2005).Â  However, Rule 203, SCRCP, does not provide that NOA be filed within thirty days of the entry of judgment; it requires the NOA be filed within thirty days after receipt of written notice of entry of the order or judgment.Â  Therefore, the thirty days began to run when Kennedy received the written notice which was mailed to her on Monday December 5, 2005.Â  Since Kennedy only appeals from the December 30, 2005 order in her NOA, she does not note when she received notice of the November 30, 2005 order.Â  Nonetheless, we find it likely Kennedy received the written notice on or before Saturday, December 10, 2005, which would render her January 11, 2006 NOA untimely.[5]Â  \r\nIf we were to accept and analyze Kennedyâ€™s notice of appeal as it reads to appeal only from the December 30, 2005 order denying her second Rule 60(b) motion, her appeal would fail.Â  Once the time to file notice of appeal concerning the November 30, 2005 order had expired, that order, â€œright or wrong,â€ became the law of the case and res judicata would preclude any further review on the issues decided therein.Â  See Ulmer v. Ulmer, 369 S.C. 486, 490, 632 S.E.2d 858, 861 (2006) (holding portion of a judgment that is not appealed presents no issue for determination by the reviewing court and constitutes, rightly or wrongly, the law of the case).Â  The special refereeâ€™s order denying Kennedyâ€™s Rule 60(b) motion, enforcing the default judgment for foreclosure, and enforcing the sale of the residence at public auction became unappealable once the time for service of notice of appeal for that order had expired.Â  Therefore, the relief sought by Kennedy no longer would be available to her through appeal of the December thirtieth order. \r\nIn an effort to provide Kennedy with the benefit of the doubt in this matter, we next endeavor to analyze her notice of appeal as though she intended to appeal from the November 30, 2005 order.Â  We do not find this analysis to prejudice Bank because they briefed this appeal as though Kennedy had appealed from the November thirtieth order.Â  In fact, Bankâ€™s assertion that Kennedyâ€™s notice of appeal was not timely is based on time elapsing from the November thirtieth order (Bank refers to it as the November 23, 2005 order.). \r\nIn response to the denial of her first Rule 60(b), SCRCP, motion, Kennedy filed a second Rule 60(b) motion.Â  Important to note is the fact that unlike a Rule 50, 52 or 59, SCRCP, motion, a Rule 60(b) motion does not have any tolling effect on the right to appeal from the challenged judgment.Â  Coward Hund Construction Co., Inc. v. Ball Corp. and Carolina Glass Contractors, Inc., 336 S.C. 1, 5-6, 518 S.E.2d 56, 59 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œTherefore, the time to appeal continues to run from the entry of the judgment that the Rule 60(b) motion challenges.â€Â  Id.Â  Â Â Â Thus, if we treat Kennedyâ€™s second motion as it is captioned, a Rule 60(b) motion, the time to serve notice of appeal would have expired prior to her January 11, 2006 service.Â  \r\nâ€œIt is the substance of the requested relief that matters â€˜regardless of the form in which the request for relief was framed.â€™â€Â \r\nRichland County v. Kaiser, 351 S.C. 89, 94, 567 S.E.2d 260, 262 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  It is possible that Kennedyâ€™s second Rule 60(b) motion should be considered as a Rule 59(e) motion.Â  Even if we were to make that assumption, Kennedyâ€™s appeal would still fail.\r\nAlthough a timely Rule 59(e) motion normally will toll the time within which an appellant must serve his notice of appeal, a successive Rule 59(e) motion will not do so.Â  Quality Trailer Products, Inc. v. CSl Equipment Company, Inc., 349 S.C. 216, 219, 562 S.E.2d 615, 617 (2002).Â  In Quality Trailer, the denial of a post-trial motion for JNOV was followed by a virtually identical motion captioned pursuant to Rules 52, 59, and 60, SCRCP.Â  Id. at 218, 562 S.E.2d at 616-17.Â  The court found â€œthe time for filing appeal is not extended by submitting the same motion under a different caption.â€Â  Id. at 220, 562 S.E.2d at 618.Â  Kennedyâ€™s first and second post-trial motions each assert only that she did not receive service of process, and we see no substantive difference between them.[6]Â  We find Kennedyâ€™s second motion, even were we to treat it as a Rule 59(e) motion, would be successive to her previous Rule 60(b) motion and would therefore not toll the time to submit notice of appeal.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe see no means by which this court can take jurisdiction over this appeal.Â  Based on the foregoing, Kennedyâ€™s appeal is\r\n DISMISSED.\r\nANDERSON, KITTREDGE, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n[2] Through a notice of hearing dated April 27, 2005, Kennedy was mailed a written notice of the hearing, but she failed to appear.Â Â Â  \r\n[3] At the outset of this hearing, Bank asserted that this second Rule 60(b) motion was identical to the previously decided Rule 60(b) motion.Â  Bank requested that the special referee not entertain this successive motion.Â  The special referee stated that he was inclined to grant the motion, but he held it in abeyance.Â  The special referee went on to say that the two motions were â€œbasically the sameâ€ and that he â€œtended to agreeâ€ with Bank.Â  Despite the refereeâ€™s statement that you canâ€™t make the same motion over and over again and his finding of â€œlittle or no substantive differenceâ€ between the motions, he decided Kennedy had expanded on her motion â€œsomewhatâ€ and since everyone was present they would go ahead with the hearing.Â  Ultimately, the referee denied Bankâ€™s motion even though he concluded he might be â€œright or wrong.â€Â  \r\n[4] Rule 203(b)(1), SCACR, applies to appeals from the court of common pleas.Â  However, Rule 203(b)(4), SCACR, dictates that notice of appeal from a special refereeâ€™s decision shall be served in the same manner. \r\n[5] We note the appellant\r\nhas the burden of providing this Court with a sufficient record upon which we can make a decision.Â \r\nState v. 192 Coin-Operated Video Game Machines, 338 S.C. 176, 195, 525 S.E.2d 872, 882, (2000).Â  Kennedy has failed to include the date she received the November 30, 2005 order.Â  \r\n[6] We are not persuaded that because Kennedyâ€™s second motion references testimony from the first hearing, it is substantively different from her initial Rule 60(b) motion. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-063","title":"Bewersdorf v.

(â€œPOAâ€), appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order finding the POA approved Jose and Madeline Araujoâ€™s application to construct a dock, denying the POAâ€™s request for an injunction and attorneyâ€™s fees, and holding the water body adjacent to the Araujosâ€™ property is legally navigable.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nI.\r\nIn February 2002, the Araujos purchased property adjacent to a small body of water in a development called Brickyard Plantation.Â  The property was sold subject to the Declaration of Covenants and Restrictions for Brickyard Plantation (â€œCovenantsâ€).Â  \r\nThe Araujosâ€™ main purpose for purchasing this property was to construct a dock that would allow them to use the adjacent water body.Â  Under section 7.2 of the Covenants, any structural improvement, including docks, must be approved by the Architectural Review Board of the POA (â€œARBâ€).Â  Section 7.2 also provides:\r\n\r\nIn the event the ARB fails to approve or disapprove any request within thirty (30) days after complete written plans and specifications have been submitted to it, the same shall be deemed approved, and this article shall be deemed to have been fully complied with, provided, however, that no such failure to act shall be deemed an approval of any matters specifically prohibited by any other provisions of this Declaration.\r\n\r\nIn September 2003, the Araujos submitted a dock permit application to the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (â€œOCRMâ€), which approved the permit.Â  Before formal approval from OCRM, however, the POA learned of the Araujosâ€™ desire to build a dock and requested the Araujos send it information on the proposed dock.Â  The POA also sent a letter to OCRM (and a copy to the Araujos) asserting that no docks were allowed on â€œlakes, marshes or lagoons without permission of the POA and ARB Board of Directors,â€ and that the POA decided not to allow any docks on ponds, marshes, lakes or lagoons under its control. \r\nIn October 2003, in response to the POAâ€™s request, the Araujosâ€™ contractor faxed a copy of the OCRM permit application and drawings to Stephen Wright, the President of the POA.Â  The contractor included a letter indicating the Aruajos would formally request approval from the home owners association after an OCRM permit was secured.Â  In November 2003, prior to a formal request by the Aruajos, the POA informed the Araujos by letter that their â€œsubmittal was reviewed by the POA board and a decision was made to deny your request based on . . . the Covenants and Restrictions.â€Â  This letter was not based on any decision or action made by the ARB; however,the letter further stated that â€œ[t]he POA and ARB Board of Directors have made a decision not to allow any dock to be constructed on the ponds, marshes, lakes or lagoons; they are only permitted on the deep water of the Horlbeck Creek.â€Â  \r\nBy permit dated January 21, 2004, OCRM approved the Araujosâ€™ dock.[2]Â  \r\nOn January 20, 2004, the Araujos attended a POA board meeting to submit the first formal request for approval by the ARB of the dock they planned to construct.[3]Â  At the meeting, the Araujos provided the POA property managerâ€”an agent of the POA and the ARBâ€”with a $50 application fee and a letter addressed to the POA regarding the construction of their dock.Â  The letter expressly provided: â€œThis is a request for ARB and or [sic] Brickyard Board of Elected Representatives for approval of said dock below.â€Â  The property manager placed the materials in the Araujosâ€™ file.Â  Thereafter, via an undated letter mailed around February 11, 2004, the POA informed the Araujos their dock would not be allowed pursuant to the Covenants.Â  \r\nOn March 5, 2004, Mrs. Araujo visited the POAâ€™s management office to examine her file.Â  Mrs. Araujo noticed the information submitted at the January board meeting, including the $50 application fee, were still in their file and had not been given to the ARB.Â  Mrs. Araujo asked the property manager to submit the materials to the ARB at their next meeting and write a note explaining the events surrounding the Araujosâ€™ submittal.Â  \r\nOn March 11, 2004, the Araujosâ€™ materials were submitted to the ARB.Â  The ARB did not approve the Araujosâ€™ dock based on sections 7.36 and 7.44 of the Covenants.Â  By a letter dated March 15, 2004, the ARB denied the Araujos request to construct a dock.Â  \r\nThereafter, the Araujos began construction of their dock, believing the OCRM and the Covenants authorized it.Â  The POA filed this action seeking an injunction requiring the removal of the Araujosâ€™ dock and a monetary fine.Â  The circuit court held the POA approved the Araujosâ€™ dock by default under section 7.2 of the Covenants, and the Araujos could construct and maintain their dock.Â  In addition, the circuit court held the water body adjacent to the Araujosâ€™ property was legally navigable.Â  The POA filed a motion to alter or amend judgment.Â  The circuit court modified its original order but did not alter the overall findings in the case.Â  This appeal follows.Â Â  \r\nII.\r\nâ€œAn action to enforce restrictive covenants by injunction is in equity.â€ Seabrook Island Prop. Owners Assâ€™n v. Marshland Trust, Inc., 358 S.C. 655, 661, 596 S.E.2d 380, 383 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  On an appeal in an action in equity, tried by the judge alone, without a reference, the appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its views of the preponderance of the evidence.Â \r\nCampbell v. Carr, 361 S.C. 258, 263, 603 S.E.2d 625, 627 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Nevertheless, â€œthis broad scope of review does not require the appellate court to ignore the findings below when the trial court was in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses.â€Â \r\nSeabrook Island Prop. Owners Assâ€™n, 358 S.C. at 661, 596 S.E.2d at 383.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIII.\r\nThe POA argues the circuit court erred in holding the ARB approved the Araujosâ€™ dock by default.Â  Specifically, the POA contends the court erred in finding the Araujosâ€™ filed an application to construct a dock with the ARB on January 20, 2004 and misinterpreted the relevant Covenants.Â  We disagree.\r\nA.Â  Application to Construct Dock\r\nThe record shows that the Araujos appeared at the January 20, 2004 POA board meeting and submitted several forms regarding the construction of their dock, an application fee, and a letter addressed to the POA.Â  The minutes from the January POA board meeting provide that the Araujos â€œaddressed the board concerning their dock applicationâ€ and presented their â€œdock request.â€Â  The letter that accompanied the Araujosâ€™ submittal provides: â€œThis is a request for ARB and or [sic] Brickyard Board of Elected Representatives for approvalâ€ to construct a dock.Â  In addition, Mrs. Araujo testified that she informed the POA board that she wanted the materials submitted to the ARB â€œper covenants and restrictions.â€Â  Mr. Araujo also testified that he considered the materials submitted at the January POA board meeting to be an application for approval to construct a dock.Â  This evidence supports finding the Araujos submitted a complete application to the POA and the ARB on January 20, 2004.Â  Moreover, where there is discrepancy in testimony, we may defer to the circuit courtâ€™s findings.Â  See Seabrook Island Prop. Owners Assâ€™n, 358 S.C. at 661, 596 S.E.2d at 383. \r\nB.Â  Interpretation of CovenantsÂ Â Â Â  Â Â  \r\nUnder section 7.2 of the Covenants, once a party submits an application requesting to construct a dock, the application is automatically approved if the ARB fails to approve or disapprove the request within thirty days.Â  This approval by default, however, does not apply for â€œany matters specifically prohibited by any other provisions of [the Covenants].â€Â  In this case, the ARB notified the Araujos that their request was denied on, at the earliest, March 15, 2004, which is well beyond the thirty day deadline for an application submitted on January 20, 2004.Â Â  \r\nThe POA contends sections 7.36(c) and 7.44 of the Covenants specifically prohibit the Araujosâ€™ dock.Â  Section 7.36(c) provides that â€œ[n]o dock, pier, or wharf shall be constructed on any lagoon and no dock, pier, or wharf shall be constructed on the marsh without approval of the Developer or ARB and the Association.â€[4]Â  Section 7.44 provides, â€œ[n]o docks, landings, or other structures may be located in or adjacent to any lake or lagoon without the prior written consent of the Developer.â€Â  The Covenants, therefore, expressly authorize the construction of a dock when approved by the appropriate person or board, i.e., the building of a dock is not a â€œmatter[] specifically prohibited by any other provisions of [the Covenants].â€\r\nâ€œAs voluntary contracts, restrictive covenants will be enforced unless they are indefinite or contravene public policy.â€Â \r\nSeabrook Island Prop. Owners Assoc., 358 S.C. at 661, 596 S.E.2d at 383.Â  â€œThe language of a restrictive covenant is to be construed according to the plain and ordinary meaning attributed to it at the time of execution.â€Â  Hardy v. Aiken, 369 S.C. 160, __, 631 S.E.2d 539, 542 (2006).Â  â€œRestrictive covenants are contractual in nature, so that the paramount rule of construction is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the parties as determined from the whole document.â€Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 622, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302 (2001) (quoting Taylor v. Lindsey, 332 S.C. 1, 4-5, 498 S.E.2d 862, 863-64 (1998)).Â  â€œIt is still the settled rule in this jurisdiction that restrictions as to the use of real estate should be strictly construed and all doubts resolved in favor of free use of the property, subject, however, to the provision that this rule of strict construction should not be applied so as to defeat the plain and obvious purpose of the instrument.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nWe find neither section 7.36 nor section 7.44 prohibits construction of the Araujosâ€™ dock.Â  Both sections expressly allow for construction upon approval by the ARB.Â  At best, the various covenants are ambiguous, which requires a resolution in line with the free use of the property.Â  Because the construction of a dock is not in all cases â€œspecifically prohibitedâ€ by either section, the application was automatically approved under section 7.2 as the ARB failed to act within thirty days of submission. \r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Injunction and Attorneyâ€™s Fees \r\nBecause we find the circuit court correctly held the ARB approved the Araujosâ€™ dock by default, we also hold the circuit court did not err in failing to grant an injunction on the Araujoâ€™s dock.Â  Likewise, the circuit court correctly declined to award the POA attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nSection 8.1 of the Covenants authorizes the POA to enforce the Covenants.Â  Section 8.9 allows the POA to recover attorneyâ€™s fees where an attorney is employed to bring an action for breach of the Covenants.Â  As discussed above, we find the Araujos did not breach the Covenants; therefore, the POA is not entitled to recover attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nIV.\r\nThe POA argues the circuit court erred in holding the water body at issue was â€œlegally navigableâ€ and â€œa public navigable water.â€Â  At trial, the POA alleged that lots adjacent to tidal ponds were subject to different restrictions than lots adjacent to Horlbeck Creek.Â  To refute this contention, the Araujos argued and the circuit court found that the tidal pond adjacent to the Araujosâ€™ property is â€œlegally navigableâ€ and â€œa public navigable water.â€Â  Because we base our holding on the language in the restrictive covenants, we find the issue of navigability is not necessary for the resolution of the appeal.Â  Accordingly, we will not address this issue.Â  See Binkley v. Rabon Creek Watershed Conservation Dist. of Fountain Inn, 348 S.C. 58, 76 n.36, 558 S.E.2d 902, 911 n.36 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œThis court will not issue advisory opinions that have no practical effect on the outcome.â€).\r\nV.\r\nFor the reasons set forth herein, the decision of the circuit court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nANDERSON, KITTREDGE and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]&nbsp; OCRM issued the Araujosâ€™ permit despite the POAâ€™s letter because the POA failed to demonstrate ownership of the water body.Â  \r\n[3]&nbsp; It is uncontested that the January 20, 2004 application was the first formal request by the Araujos for approval of the dock.Â  There is no contention by the POA that the activity in late 2003 was either an application by the Araujos or a formal rejection by the POA or ARB.Â  In the trial court and on appeal, the focus of the POA is on the Covenants in the context of the January 20, 2004 application.\r\n[4]&nbsp; The inclusion of â€œthe Developerâ€ has no relevance to this case.Â  The Developer was only authorized to grant approval before it sold a certain number of properties, at which time all approval rights transferred to the ARB pursuant to section 7.2 of the Covenants.Â  At all times relevant for this action, the ARB had the right of approval for the construction of a dock.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-066","title":"Computer Products v.

Jones, and Susan Taylor Wall, all of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Computer Products, Inc. (Computer Products) appeals orders of the circuit court granting summary judgment to JEM Restaurant Group, Inc. (JEM), John E. McGrath (McGrath), Monolith Software Solutions, Inc. (Monolith), and W. David Valmus (Valmus).Â  Computer Products argues the circuit court erred in not finding: (1) an agency relationship between Valmus and Computer Products; (2) a duty of loyalty and/or fiduciary duty Valmus owed to Computer Products; and (3) that McGrath aided or abetted Valmusâ€™s breach of loyalty and/or fiduciary duty.Â  Computer Products also argues the circuit court erred in its application of: (1) South Carolina Trade Secrets Act; (2) Unfair Trade Practices Act; and (3) the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nI.Â  Computer Products failed to preserve its argument regarding the circuit courtâ€™s finding that Valmus was an agent because it did not make this argument in a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion.Â  West v. Newberry Elec. Coop., 357 S.C. 537, 543, 593 S.E.2d 500, 503 (Ct. App. 2004) (certiorari denied) (holding issue that is neither addressed by the circuit court in the final order nor raised by way of Rule 59(e) motion is not preserved for review).Â  \r\nII.Â  Computer Products argues that because Valmus was an agent/employee of Computer Products, Valmus had a duty of loyalty to Computer Products.Â  However, at trial, Computer Products conceded that Valmus was an independent contractor, not its employee; therefore, this argument is without merit.Â  See, e.g., Kirkland v. Allcraft Steel Co., Inc., 329 S.C. 389, 392-93, 496 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1998) (finding a concession made at trial precludes a party from contesting the issue on appeal).\r\nIII.Â  Computer Products contends that the circuit court erred in finding as a matter of law that McGrath did not aid or abet Valmusâ€™s breach of loyalty and/or fiduciary duty.Â  Because we have determined that no duty of loyalty and/or fiduciary duty existed between Valmus and Computer Products, we need not address this issue.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (stating the appellate court need not address remaining issues when resolution of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\nIV.Â  Computer Products failed to preserve its argument regarding the circuit courtâ€™s finding that as a matter of law the South Carolina Trade Secrets Act is inapplicable, or in the alternative that Computer Products did not meet its burden of proof. Â Humbert v. State, 345 S.C. 332, 337, 548 S.E.2d 862, 865 (2001); Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 460, 535 S.E.2d 438, 445 (2000) (holding that where a trial court does not explicitly rule on an argument raised, and appellant makes no Rule 59(e) motion to obtain a ruling, the appellate court may not address the issue).\r\nV.Â  Computer Products abandoned its argument regarding its allegation that the circuit court erred in finding as a matter of law that McGrath did not violate the Unfair Trade Practice Act.Â  Fields v. Melrose Ltd. Pâ€™ship., 312 S.C. 102, 106, 439 S.E.2d 283, 285 (Ct. App. 1993) ( â€œAn issue raised on appeal but not argued in the brief is deemed abandoned and will not be considered by the appellate court.â€). Â The issue is also abandoned as to McGrath because Computer Productsâ€™ presentation of this issue in its brief is conclusory and lacks supporting authority.Â  Mulherin-Howell v. Cobb, 362 S.C. 588, 600, 608 S.E.2d 587, 593-94 (Ct.App.2005) (noting when an appellant fails to cite any supporting authority for his position and makes\r\nconclusory arguments, the appellant abandons the issue on appeal).\r\nVI.Â  Â Computer Products argues the circuit court erred in finding as a matter of law that a covenant of good faith and fair dealing is inapplicable. Â Computer Products did not bring a claim for breach of contract; therefore, its cause of action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing does not succeed as a matter of law.Â  See Rotec Servs., Inc. v. Encompass Servs., Inc., 359 S.C. 467, 471-473, 597 S.E.2d 881, 883-884 (Ct.

Phillips,Â  of Anderson, for Appellants.\r\n        Richard E. Thompson, Jr., of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Charlie Gallowayâ€™s Furniture Shop, Inc., d/b/a Furniture Depot Design Center and Charlie M. Galloway, Jr., (collectively â€œGallowayâ€) appeal the special refereeâ€™s finding that J. Jackie Watt (decedent) owned forty percent of Gallowayâ€™s Furniture Shop, Inc.Â  Galloway also contends the special referee erred in finding the action was not filed beyond the statute of limitations.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn March 2, 1989, Galloway and decedent jointly purchased property on which Gallowayâ€™s Furniture Shop was operated.Â  A disagreement arose over the operation of the business and, on February 7, 1996, decedent filed suit against Galloway alleging he was a forty percent shareholder in the corporation.Â  Decedent alleged the parties could no longer work together and asked for the corporation to be dissolved.Â  Galloway filed an Answer and Counterclaim alleging decedent was a thirty-nine percent shareholder.Â  Decedent maintained he was a forty percent shareholder, and thereafter, Galloway filed an Amended Answer and Counterclaim alleging decedent did not own any shares of the corporation because he failed to provide adequate consideration.Â  Decedent filed a reply denying the allegations and asking that Gallowayâ€™s counterclaim be barred by the statute of limitations.Â  On January 16, 1998, the case was referred to a special referee.Â  \r\nOn September 13, 1998, decedent passed away.Â  An estate was opened and it was determined that his heirs were his three children:Â  Mark D. Watt, Diane M. Watt, and William J. Watt, of whom Mark Watt was appointed the personal representative.Â  After the death of his father, Mark Watt approached Galloway concerning his fatherâ€™s share of the corporation.Â  This was followed by a second visit, at which time Mark Watt asked Galloway to value the corporation so that he could determine the value of his late fatherâ€™s share.Â Â Â  According to Mark Watt, Galloway gave a figure of $250,000 but stated that â€œthey shouldnâ€™t record all of that figure because [decedent] only owned thirty-nine percent of it.â€Â Â  In December 2001, Mark Watt had another conversation with Galloway concerning the probate of his fatherâ€™s estate.Â  During this conversation, Galloway told Mark Watt that decedent did not own any interest in the corporation, and as such, there would be no division.Â  At this time, Mark Watt became concerned and consulted an attorney. Â Â \r\nOn October 18, 2002, Mark Watt, individually and as an agent for the estate, filed a lawsuit alleging decedent was a forty percent shareholder of the corporation and asking for judicial dissolution of the corporation, a court ordered sale of shares, and a partition of the property. Â In his Second Amended Answer and Counterclaim, Galloway alleged decedent was merely an employee of the corporation and did not own any shares.Â  Galloway further alleged that even if decedent did own shares, the complaint should be dismissed as filed beyond the applicable statute of limitations.Â  A hearing was held September 27-29, 2005, at which the special referee found decedent was a forty percent shareholder in the corporation and the action was not filed beyond the applicable statute of limitations.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œA corporate dissolution, under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-14-300 et seq., is an equitable relief. &nbsp;The provisions of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-14-310(d), allowing for appropriate alternative relief including a buyout of shareholders by other shareholders or the corporation, are also equitable.â€&nbsp; Kiriakides v. Atlas Food Sys. &amp; Servs., Inc., 338 S.C. 572, 581, 527 S.E.2d 371, 375-76 (Ct. App. 2000) affâ€™d as modified, 343 S.C. 587, 541 S.E.2d 257 (2001) (citations omitted).Â  Our scope of review for a case heard by a Master-in-Equity or special referee who enters a final judgment is the same as that for review of a case heard by a circuit court without a jury. &nbsp;Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 237, 391 S.E.2d 538, 543 (1990) (citations omitted).Â  In an equity action, the appellate court may review the evidence to determine the facts in accordance with its own view of the evidence.Â  Florence County Sch. Dist. #2 v. Interkal, Inc., 348 S.C. 446, 450, 559 S.E.2d 866, 868 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  However, the appellate court does not disregard the findings of the special referee who was in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses.Â  Tiger, at 237, 391 S.E.2d at 543.Â  Furthermore, the appellate court is not bound by the trial courtâ€™s legal determinations.Â  Â Swindler v. Swindler, 355 S.C. 245, 249, 584 S.E.2d 438, 440 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing Iâ€™on, L.L.C.Â  v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 411, 526 S.E.2d 716, 718-19 (2000)).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Ownership\r\nGalloway contends the special referee erred in finding the decedent owned forty percent of the corporation.Â  He contends the evidence established that the decedent never paid for any shares of stock, as requested by Galloway.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe evidence presented at trial supports the special refereeâ€™s findings.Â  One of the witnesses, Patricia Sparks, a bookkeeper for Price Bookkeeping and Tax Service, testified she had prepared tax returns for Galloway Furniture for a number of years.Â  At one point, Galloway and the decedent brought papers to her office and told her that the corporate papers were to be changed so that the decedent would have a share in the corporation. Â She did not remember the exact percentages each were to retain but did remember that Galloway was to retain a greater percentage than decedent.Â  Galloway told her to issue shares in both Gallowayâ€™s and the decedentâ€™s names.Â  A copy of the stock certificates with both Galloway and the decedentâ€™s names was entered into evidence.Â  \r\nAs to the question of whether the decedent failed to pay for his shares, Sparksâ€™ testimony at a previous deposition was that it was her understanding the decedent was not required to pay for his shares of stock because they were issued to him in return for the work he did for the business and for his help in building the business.Â  She said this understanding was based on what both the decedent and Galloway had told her.Â  However, at trial Sparks testified that at some point Galloway told her that the decedent was supposed to have paid for the shares but never did.Â  Â Â \r\nThe special referee also based its decision on the testimony of Kirk Messick, the certified public accountant that did all the accounting for Galloway Furniture after Sparks.Â  Messick testified that in examining the books and records presented to him when he began working for Galloway, he noticed that the decedent and his social security number were both listed on the previous yearâ€™s tax return under Compensation of Officers.Â  Messick further testified that at the time he took over the bookkeeping from Price Accounting Service and Sparks, the records showed that the decedent was a forty percent owner of the business.Â  \r\nThe only testimony presented at trial to show the decedent did not own shares of Galloway Furniture was that of Galloway himself and his repeated assertions that decedent did not pay for his shares.Â  However, the testimony of the other witnesses clearly supported the special refereeâ€™s finding that decedent owned forty percent of the corporation and that the consideration for those shares was his work for the corporation.Â  Furthermore, by this courtâ€™s calculation, the number of shares listed on the stock certificates in the record showed decedent owned forty percent of the corporation.[2]Â  Â Â Given the special referee was in a better position to judge the creditability of the witnessesâ€™ testimony and the ample evidence in the record, we defer to his finding that decedent owned forty percent of the corporation. Â See Tiger, at 237, 391 S.E.2d at 543.Â  \r\nII.Â  Statute of LimitationsÂ  \r\nGalloway contends the special referee erred in failing to dismiss the causes of action based on the applicable statute of limitations.Â  Specifically, Galloway contends the suit is untimely because the heirs should have known about the suit in September 1998, when their father passed away, yet the suit was not filed until 2002, four years later.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nBoth the 1998 action filed by the decedent and the 2002 action filed by the heirs maintained the same causes of action: judicial dissolution of the corporation and court-ordered sale of shares.Â  The 1998 action was never dismissed, but was ended on January 16, 1998 pursuant to a consent order appointing a special referee. Â Galloway never moved to have the 1998 case dismissed.Â  \r\nSection 15-3-530(9) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) provides a statute of limitations of three years in cases involving an action against the directors or stockholders of a corporation to enforce a liability.Â  This cause of action is not considered to have accrued until the date of discovery by the aggrieved parties of the facts upon which the liability is created.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(9) (Supp. 2005).Â  In the instant case, Mark Watt did not discover that his fatherâ€™s ownership in the corporation was at question until a discussion with Galloway in November 2001.Â  Until this time, Mark Wattâ€™s previous conversations with Galloway indicated the decedent had at least some ownership in the corporation.Â  After Mark Watt realized his fatherâ€™s shares were in dispute, he contacted a lawyer and filed the present action on October 18, 2002, well within the three year statute of limitations period.Â  Accordingly, the special referee was correct in finding the instant action was filed within the applicable statute of limitations.Â \r\n    CONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the special refereeâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nANDERSON, KITTREDGE, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The number of shares shown on the stock certificates as owned by Galloway is 58,137.Â  The number of shares shown on the stock certificates to be owned by the deceased is 38,758.Â  As Sparks testified there were only two stock certificates issued for the corporation, the total shares issued was 96,895.Â  Exactly forty percent of the total number of shares issued is 38,758, the number of shares shown to be owned by the decedent.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-073","title":"In the Matter of Floyd B.

Warner, of Columbia, for Appellant.Â  \r\n        James H. Renfrow, Jr., of Dillon, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Â In this probate matter, Murdell McFarlin appeals orders of the circuit and probate courts based on lack of jurisdiction and ex parte communication.Â  We affirm in part, vacate in part, and dismiss the remainder as moot. \r\nFACTS\r\nIn March of 2000, McFarlin applied to the judge of the Marlboro County Probate Court to be appointed guardian and conservator for her father, Floyd B. Walker. Â After a hearing, the probate court appointed McFarlin as guardian but held the issue of conservatorship in abeyance.Â  The probate court appointed Ralph Kelly guardian ad litem in the conservatorship proceedings.Â  McFarlin was eventually appointed conservator. Â \r\nMcFarlin filed the conservatorâ€™s annual accounting for the years 2001, 2002, and 2003.Â  In February 2003, the probate judge informed McFarlin by letter that she failed to use the accounting method and format required by the probate court in her annual accountings.Â  In July of 2004, the probate judge informed McFarlin the conservatorship would be audited, and required her to provide bank records and other supporting documentation within thirty days.Â  McFarlin contacted accountant David E. Martin to review the documents and assist her in preparing an accounting.Â  McFarlin also retained an attorney to represent her.Â  \r\nOn October 22, 2004, the probate judge summoned McFarlin to appear at a hearing set for November 30, 2004, and to produce all financial records and accounting.Â  Prior to the hearing, the judge and the judgeâ€™s secretary investigated McFarlinâ€™s records and issued subpoenas for cellular phone and bank records.Â  On November 22, 2004, the probate judge held a pre-trial conference and informed McFarlinâ€™s attorney he had concerns about the handling of Walkerâ€™s finances based on his and his secretaryâ€™s investigation. Â Although McFarlinâ€™s accountant stated he had reconciled the accounts, the judge allegedly refused to review these records, finding them â€œjust too much to go through.â€Â  The judge also allegedly concluded McFarlinâ€™s hiring of an attorney indicated guilt, and if she â€œpressed for a hearing,â€ he would â€œturn [her] over to the Solicitorâ€ to face criminal charges.Â  At the pretrial conference, the probate judge decided to cancel the hearing scheduled for November 30, and in its place directed McFarlinâ€™s attorney and the guardian, Kelly, to meet on November 30 at the attorneyâ€™s office to review the financial records and accounting.Â  \r\nKelly failed to appear at the meeting. Â He was, instead, at a hearing being held in probate court, apparently without the knowledge of McFarlin or any of her representatives.Â  As a result of that hearing, the probate judge issued an ex parte order freezing Walkerâ€™s accounts, finding McFarlin had â€œexpended funds from the . . . accounts in a manner that does not comply with the South Carolina Statute for Conservators. . . .Â  Until the court may conduct a full hearing on the merits . . . the conservator shall not administer or distribute any of the protected personâ€™s assets. . . .â€ Â The probate judge also summoned McFarlin to appear at a hearing on January 10, 2005 to review the accounting and ordered her to forward Walkerâ€™s bills to his attention. Â \r\nIn December, McFarlinâ€™s current attorney replaced her original attorney and appealed the order freezing accounts to the circuit court.Â  A few days later, and while the appeal was pending, the probate court appointed James&nbsp;H. Renfrow, Jr. as guardian ad litem and attorney for Walker.Â  That same day, Renfrow filed a petition requesting:Â  (1) McFarlin provide a full and complete accounting; (2) McFarlin be removed and a successor conservator appointed; (3) a temporary conservator be appointed until a successor conservator could be appointed; and (4) McFarlin be required to pay actual and punitive damages if the accounting proved the funds had been misappropriated.Â  \r\nShortly thereafter, McFarlin moved to vacate all orders and recuse the probate judge on the grounds of:Â  (1) lack of jurisdiction; (2) failure to comply with the statutory law of South Carolina; and (3) violation of judicial ethics, including ex parte communications, threatening criminal prosecution, self-investigating, and advising McFarlin she should not seek counsel.Â  \r\nOn January 10, 2005, the probate judge held a hearing on Renfrowâ€™s motion for the appointment of a temporary conservator and a continuance.Â  The probate judge granted Renfrowâ€™s request for a temporary conservator.Â  McFarlin filed a second notice of appeal on January 19, 2005, and on January&nbsp;28, 2005 the probate judge granted Renfrowâ€™s motion for a continuance, but denied McFarlinâ€™s motion to vacate and recuse himself. Â McFarlin filed a supplemental notice of appeal on January 28, 2005.Â  The probate judge filed a return with the circuit court on February 9, 2005.Â  The probate judge then, on February 17, 2005, recused himself from any further participation in the matter. Â \r\nIn March of 2005, the circuit court heard the appeals brought by McFarlin and issued an â€œundatedâ€ order remanding the case to the substitute probate judge for rulings, and suggesting the probate judge notify law enforcement should he discover any criminal discrepancies.Â  On April 28, 2005, McFarlin moved to reconsider the circuit courtâ€™s order.Â  On June 2, 2005, the circuit courtâ€™s law clerk went to the probate judgeâ€™s office and retrieved the original files from the guardianship and conservatorship proceedings. Â Six days later, on June 8, 2005, the circuit court issued an amended order, affirming the probate court.Â  This appeal followed.Â  During the pendency of this appeal, Walker died and McFarlin was appointed executor by the Fulton County, Georgia, Probate Court. Â \r\nAPPEALABILITY\r\nRenfrow, the guardian ad litem, argues the appeal should be dismissed as interlocutory and not immediately appealable.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe probate courtâ€™s order froze the accounts â€œuntil a court may conduct a full hearing on the merits.â€Â  The circuit courtâ€™s order affirmed the probate court.Â  An order freezing the accounts is in the nature of an injunction.Â  Grosshuesch v. Cramer, 367 S.C. 1, 5, 623 S.E.2d 833, 835 (2005) (interpreting order freezing assets as an injunction).Â  Under the South Carolina Code, injunctions are immediately appealable.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(4) (Supp. 2006); Eldridge v. City of Greenwood, 308 S.C. 125, 127, 417 S.E.2d 532, 534 (1992) (finding order in the nature of an injunction immediately appealable).Â  We accordingly find the circuit court order, although interlocutory in nature, immediately appealable.\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\nI.Â  Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\nMcFarlin initially argues the probate court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter the orders appointing a guardian and temporary conservator due to the failure to comply with statutory requirements.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œSubject matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.â€Â  Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 150, 526 S.E.2d 222, 227 (2000).Â  The probate court has subject matter jurisdiction over incapacitated persons.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 62-1-302(a)(2) &amp; 62-5-102(a) (Supp. 2006).Â  The probate court may have violated the statutory requirements to observe conditions and report to the court and the statutory requirements governing the medical examination of the person alleged to be incapacitated.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 62-5-303(b) (examinations regarding guardianships) &amp; 62-5-407(b) (examinations regarding conservatorships) (1987).Â  However, the alleged violations of statutory requirements did not deprive the probate court of its subject matter jurisdiction over incapacitated persons.Â  See S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Meek, 352 S.C. 523, 530, 575 S.E.2d 846, 849 (Ct. App. 2002) (finding failure to comply with statutory requirements did not divest the family court of subject matter jurisdiction). \r\nII.Â  Judicial Conduct\r\nMcFarlin contends the circuit court erred by failing to vacate orders issued by the probate judge based on the probate judgeâ€™s alleged judicial misconduct.Â  â€œThe Commission [on Judicial Conduct] has jurisdiction over judges regarding allegations that misconduct occurred before or during service as a judge . . . .â€Â  Rule 3(b)(1), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR (Supp. 2006).Â  As this court has no authority regarding this issue, we decline to address it.Â  \r\nIII. Â Ex Parte Communication\r\nMcFarlin also alleges the circuit court erred by issuing a ruling after allegedly engaging in ex parte communication with the probate judge.Â  We disagree.\r\nEx parte communication consists of â€œprohibited communication between counsel and the court when opposing counsel is not present.â€Â  Brown v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 354 S.C. 436, 440 n.3, 581 S.E.2d 836, 838 n.3 (2003).Â  In this case, the circuit courtâ€™s law clerk retrieved the probate courtâ€™s files in the guardianship and conservatorship proceedings, including records not provided to McFarlin.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-308(b) (Supp. 2006) (requiring the probate court to file a return when an appeal is taken to the circuit court).Â  \r\nThe records purportedly contained handwritten memos and notations of the probate judge taken during the guardianship and conservatorship proceedings.Â  After reviewing the probate courtâ€™s records, the circuit court issued an amended order affirming the judgment of the probate judge.Â  \r\nMcFarlin argues the circuit courtâ€™s review of the probate judgeâ€™s memos and notations permitted the probate judge to have an ex parte voice in the appeal to the circuit court, in violation of section 62-1-308 of the South Carolina Code.Â  Section 62-1-308(f) provides:Â  â€œA judge of a probate court must not be admitted to have any voice in judging or determining an appeal from his decision or be permitted to act as attorney or counsel.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-308(f) (Supp. 2006).Â  We decline to equate the circuit courtâ€™s review of the probate judgeâ€™s file with the inappropriate participation by a probate judge in an appeal.Â  Furthermore, the alleged ex parte communication involved communications between the courts, and is therefore not violative of the general rule prohibiting ex parte communication.Â  Accordingly, we find no reversible error on this ground.Â  \r\nIV.Â  Issuance of Orders Following Notices of Appeal\r\nMcFarlin contends the circuit court erred by not finding the probate judge improperly continued to issue orders after notices of appeal had been filed and served and argues this court should vacate the probate court orders.Â  We agree in part. \r\nThe timing of relevant events is determinative of this issue.Â  The events occurred as follows:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    3/22/00:\r\n    McFarlin petitions to be appointed guardian. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    4/25/00:&nbsp;\r\n    Order appointing McFarlin guardian.  \r\n      Order appointing Ralph Kelly guardian ad litem. \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Jan. 2001:&nbsp;\r\n    Order appointing McFarlin conservator. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    11/30/04:\r\n    Order freezing accounts. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    12/9/04:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Notice of appeal of 11/30/04 order filed. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    12/30/04:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Probate court order appointing Renfrow guardian ad litem. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    1/10/05:&nbsp;\r\n    Probate court order denying McFarlin&rsquo;s motions to vacate and recuse. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    1/13/05:\r\n    Probate court order appointing temporary conservator. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    1/19/05:\r\n    Second notice of appeal filed, appealing order appointing temporary conservator and orders denying McFarlin&rsquo;s motions. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    1/28/05:\r\n    Probate court order granting Renfrow&rsquo;s motion for continuance; denying McFarlin&rsquo;s motions. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    1/28/05:\r\n    Supplemental notice of appeal of the January 28, 2005 order filed.&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe probate code provides:Â  â€œWhen an appeal according to law is taken from any sentence or decree of the probate court, all proceedings in pursuance of the order, sentence, or decree appealed from shall cease until the judgment of the [appellate court] is had.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-308(c) (Supp. 2006).Â  The circuit court acts solely as an appellate court in appeals from the probate court.Â  Id.Â  â€œUpon the service of the notice of appeal, the appellate court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the appeal.â€Â  Rule 205, SCACR (Supp. 2006).Â  Once the notice of appeal is served, the circuit court has exclusive jurisdiction except for matters not affected by the appeal.Â  Bunkum v. Manor Props., 321 S.C. 95, 98-99, 467 S.E.2d 758, 760 (Ct. App. 1996). \r\nWe find the probate court lost jurisdiction over the matters affected by the appeal after McFarlin filed and served the notice of appeal of the November 30, 2004 order.Â  We find all issues addressed by the probate court thereafter, except the issue appointing Renfrow as substitute guardian ad litem in the December 30, 2004 order, were affected by the appeal.Â  Accordingly, we vacate the probate court orders dated January 10, 2005 and January 28, 2005.\r\nAs to the December 30, 2004 order appointing Renfrow substitute guardian ad litem, we conclude the probate court had continuing jurisdiction over this matter, even after the notice of appeal was filed.Â  However, we also find this order effective only until the date of Walkerâ€™s death.Â  Beyond that date, the guardianship expired.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-5-306 (1987) (terminating the authority of a guardian upon the death of the ward).Â  \r\nV.Â  Probate Court Orders Issued Without Findings of Fact; Factual Findings Made Without a Hearing\r\nMcFarlin contends the circuit court erred by not finding the probate court issued orders affecting substantial rights of McFarlin and Walker without making findings of material facts and allegations.Â  We need not address this issue based on the disposition of the case.Â  \r\nMcFarlin also argues the probate court erred in making the factual finding in its November 30, 2004 order, without a hearing, that McFarlin had â€œexpended funds from the . . . accounts in a manner that does not comply with the S.C. Statute for Conservators. . . .â€Â  We need not address this issue as it is moot due to Walkerâ€™s death.Â  The Georgia Probate Court in Fulton County has jurisdiction over Walkerâ€™s estate and, accordingly, the matters pending in the South Carolina Probate Court, pursuant to the circuit courtâ€™s order, are moot.Â  â€œA case becomes moot when judgment, if rendered, will have no practical legal effect upon existing controversy.Â  This is true when some event occurs making it impossible for [the] reviewing Court to grant effectual relief.â€Â  Byrd v. Irmo High School, 321 S.C. 426, 431, 468 S.E.2d 861, 864 (1996) (quoting Mathis v. S.C. State Highway Depâ€™t, 260 S.C. 344, 346, 195 S.E.2d 713, 715 (1973)).Â  In this case, Walkerâ€™s death moots the issues surrounding McFarlinâ€™s handling of Walkerâ€™s affairs in the jurisdiction of the probate court of Marlboro County.Â  \r\nVI.Â  Circuit Courtâ€™s Orders\r\nMcFarlin argues the circuit court erred in making findings of fact and issuing rulings with regard to issues not on appeal to the circuit court.Â  The order on appeal to the circuit court was the November 30, 2004 order freezing all accounts in the name of either Floyd B. Walker, Jr. or Murdell&nbsp;W. McFarlin.\r\nPursuant to the provisions of the probate code, a hearing on an appeal from the probate court â€œmust be strictly on appeal and no new evidence must be presented.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-308(d) (Supp. 2006).Â  In her notice of appeal, McFarlin raised procedural and jurisdictional issues and the failure of the probate judge to recuse himself.Â  We agree that in its order the circuit court made factual findings that exceeded the scope of its jurisdiction on appeal and were based on new evidence on which no finding was made by the probate court in the order on appeal.Â  To the extent the circuit court made factual findings as to improper expenditures on the part of McFarlin, the order of the circuit court is vacated.Â  \r\nThe circuit court also affirmed the probate courtâ€™s order to the effect that all the accounts are frozen.Â  Because of the death of Floyd B. Walker, both the guardianship and conservatorship are terminated, and any issues pending in the probate court of Marlboro County are likewise terminated.Â  Any persons having claims related to the conduct of the conservatorship may have recourse in the Georgia Probate Court, or as may be otherwise indicated.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe initially find the order on appeal to be interlocutory but immediately appealable.Â  We decline to rule on the allegations of judicial misconduct or the probate courtâ€™s factual findings.Â  We affirm on the issues of subject matter jurisdiction and ex parte communications.Â  We likewise affirm the circuit courtâ€™s order to the extent it affirmed the probate courtâ€™s appointment of a guardian ad litem until Walkerâ€™s death.Â  We vacate the circuit courtâ€™s order to the extent it made factual findings as to the propriety of McFarlinâ€™s expenditures.Â  We finally dismiss the order as moot to the extent it affirms the probate courtâ€™s order to set a hearing date on the propriety of McFarlinâ€™s expenditures. \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.\r\nGOOLSBY and STILWELL, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-074","title":"State v.

Elliott;\r\n        Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; and Solicitor Barbara R. Morgan, of Aiken, Â for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Charles Smalls appeals his convictions for two counts of first degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor, and lewd act upon a child. Â Smalls argues the trial judge abused his discretion by allowing the State to present inadmissible hearsay testimony. Â We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nSmalls was accused of sexually molesting his girlfriendâ€™s eight-year-old granddaughter (Victim).Â  Shortly after the alleged assault, the police took Victim to the hospital, where she was examined by Nurse Amanda Abbott.Â  Nurse Abbot witnessed the external genitalia exam conducted by Doctor Platt, who found no physical evidence of sexual abuse.[1]Â  \r\nNurse Abbot, whom the lower court qualified as an expert in â€œsexual assault nurse examination,â€ testified that she conducted the interview for the purposes of medical diagnosis and treatment, and evidence collection. Â Nurse Abbottâ€™s testimony describing Victimâ€™s account was as follows:\r\n\r\n  [Victim] went into detail to tell me what happened to her earlier in the evening . . . . She just said that he was in the trailer with her and that he â€“ she was in the kitchen and he pushed her into the bathroom and when she did, she hit her elbow on the bathtub.Â  And he grabbed her by the hand to take her into the bedroom.\r\n  While they were in the bathroom, he had pulled up her skirt and pulled her panties down.Â  When they went into the bedroom, he had gotten a red thing out of the drawer and put it on his private parts.Â  He started touching himself and white stuff went into the red thing.Â  He was touching her private parts with his hand.Â  And grandma came into the room.Â  \r\n\r\nWhen asked if Victim indicated whether there was digital penetration, Nurse Abbott responded: â€œYes, she did.â€Â  Although Nurse Abbott did not describe â€œdigital penetrationâ€ in her written summary of Victimâ€™s testimony, she checked off â€œdigital penetrationâ€ on an attached checklist.Â  \r\nSmalls timely objected to Nurse Abbottâ€™s testimony recounting Victimâ€™s story, arguing it was hearsay exceeding the scope of the medical diagnosis exception in Rule 803(4), SCRE.Â  Pursuant to this objection, the trial judge allowed Smalls to obtain a proffer of exactly what testimony the State would elicit from Nurse Abbot in order to be able to more fully argue his objection.Â  Thus, outside the presence of the jury, the State examined Nurse Abbott in substantially the same way, eliciting substantially the same testimony as that presented to the jury and described above.Â  Then, after hearing arguments from both parties, the trial judge overruled Smallsâ€™ objection.[2]Â  \r\nVictim, who was nine years old at the trial, testified in detail.Â  She provided an account consistent to that later provided by her grandmother and Nurse Abbott, but also describing Smalls penetrating her digitally, and attempting penile penetration.Â  Victim testified about talking to Nurse Abbott afterwards, but said that she did not tell her everything because she was afraid.Â  \r\n In addition, Victimâ€™s grandmother testified that as she walked into the trailer, she heard Victim say â€œQuit, Charles,â€ and saw Smalls zipping up his pants.Â  Victimâ€™s grandmother also testified about what Victim told her about the incident.Â  This testimony was consistent with Victimâ€™s account, including the penile penetration but not mentioning digital penetration. Â Although the grandmotherâ€™s written statement did not specifically state that Victim reported penile penetration, it did state that he put a condom â€œon his [penis], . . . and . . . he was messing with her, it wonâ€™t hurt â€“ it wonâ€™t hurt her.â€Â  \r\nThe jury convicted Smalls of two counts of first degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor, and one count of lewd act upon a child.Â  He was sentenced to two concurrent terms of twenty years imprisonment suspended on service of thirteen years imprisonment and three years probation, and a concurrent term of ten years imprisonment and service of three years probation, respectively. Â This appeal followed.\r\nSCOPE OF REVIEW\r\nA trial judgeâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of legal error that results in prejudice to the defendant.Â  State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 377, 580 S.E.2d 785, 793 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Only errors so substantial that they result in a verdict which would not otherwise have been rendered require reversal.Â  State v. Jolly, 304 S.C. 34, 39, 402 S.E.2d 895, 898 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  A defendant seeking reversal based on error in admission of evidence has the burden of showing that evidence was prejudicial.Â  State v. McElveen, 280 S.C. 325, 327, 313 S.E.2d 298, 299 (1984).Â  Improperly admitted hearsay which is merely cumulative to other evidence may be viewed as harmless.Â  State v. Blackburn, 271 S.C. 324, 329, 247 S.E.2d 334, 337 (1978).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSmalls argues the trial judge abused his discretion by allowing the State to present Nurse Abbottâ€™s hearsay testimony. Specifically, Smalls argues that testimony from Nurse Abbott describing digital penetration was hearsay outside the scope of the medical exception.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 803(4), SCRE, permits the introduction of hearsay for â€œpurpose of medical diagnosis or treatment,â€ stating:\r\n\r\n  Statements made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment and describing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external source therefore insofar as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment . . . .\r\n\r\nSmalls points out that during Abbottâ€™s in-camera proffer, she diagnosed the victim with â€œalleged sexual assault,â€ but that during her trial testimony no medical diagnosis or conclusion was presented to the jury.Â  This is irrelevant because the â€œmedical exceptionâ€ to the hearsay rule does not require that testimony be introduced for the purpose of presenting a medical diagnosis.[3]Â  Rather, the rule requires that the statements introduced were made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment.Â  See Rule 803(4), SCRE.\r\nSmalls references this courtâ€™s case of State v. Burroughs, 328 S.C. 489, 492 S.E.2d 408 (Ct. App. 1997), to support his contention that Nurse Abbottâ€™s testimony was inadmissible.Â  His reliance on Burroughs is ill-founded, as it is readily distinguishable from this case.Â  In Burroughs, a statement that an alleged rapist â€œasked for a hugâ€ was found outside the scope of the â€œmedical diagnosisâ€ exception because it was not â€œreasonably pertinentâ€ to the victimâ€™s diagnosis or treatment.Â  In contrast, Nurse Abbottâ€™s testimony addressed the physical contact described by Victim and the use of a condom during the alleged assault.Â  The extent of physical contact in a sexual assault is certainly reasonably pertinent to medical diagnosis and treatment, so as to assess the extent of possible physical injury.Â  The use of condoms is reasonably pertinent to diagnosis and treatment of possible sexually transmitted disease and pregnancy.Â  \r\nSmallsâ€™ reference to State v. Brown is likewise unhelpful because Nurse Abbott did not introduce Victimâ€™s identification of Smalls. State v. Brown, 286 S.C. 445, 334 S.E.2d 816 (1985) (holding victimâ€™s identification of alleged rapist examination was inadmissible hearsay because perpetratorâ€™s name was not necessary for diagnosis and treatment). \r\nThe trial judgeâ€™s careful adherence to the limitations of the medical exception is evidenced by his requiring the exclusion of testimony by Nurse Abbott about the lubricant used by Smalls in the alleged assault. Â We therefore find no error in the trial judgeâ€™s admission of Nurse Abbottâ€™s testimony.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nBased on the foregoing, Smallsâ€™ convictions for first degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor, and lewd act upon a child areÂ  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Dr. Platt did not perform an internal genitalia exam because the hospital did not have the specialized equipment required to examine a small child. \r\n[2] The judge forbade the State from referencing lubricants in the testimony before the jury, reasoning that that portion of Victimâ€™s story did not fall under the medical diagnosis exception.Â  (R. 182).Â  \r\n[3] Hearsay, including that excepted under the â€œmedical exceptionâ€, is that species of testimony given by a witness who relates, not what she knows personally, but what others have told her, or what she has heard said by others.Â  It is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.Â  Fed.R.Evid. 801(c). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-075","title":"State v.

Macaulay, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-077\r\nSubmitted February 1, 2007 â€“ Filed February 13, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Chief Attorney Joseph L. Savitz, III, of Columbia, for Appellant\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General Melody J. Brown, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Christina Theos Adams, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â Dennis Harold Crowe, Jr. appeals his murder conviction.Â  He argues the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury on involuntary manslaughter.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nAt approximately 3 A.M. on June 20, 2003, Dennis Harold Crowe, Jr. sought emergency assistance for his girlfriend Roberta Flora Davis (Bertie).Â  He informed the 911 dispatcher that Bertie was not breathing, and he thought she was dead.Â  An ambulance and the police were dispatched to the residence which Crowe and Bertie shared at 111 Short Street in Salem.Â  \r\nUpon arriving at the residence, the police found Bertie lying dead in her bed.Â  Crowe, who appeared to be inebriated, stated that she had fallen during the day.Â  The police noted that three other individuals, all of whom appeared inebriated, were present at the residence.Â  \r\nThe Oconee County Coroner (Coroner) arrived at the residence at approximately 4:03 A.M. and spoke with Crowe concerning Bertie.Â  As per Coronerâ€™s testimony, Crowe informed Coroner that he and Bertie had been drinking all day, and she fell.Â  Crowe told Coroner that he attempted to assist Bertie into the cab of a pick-up truck, but when this was unsuccessful, he placed her in the bed of the truck and drove her to their residence where she fell again.Â  Coroner further testified that Crowe stated that Bertie urinated and defecated on herself whereupon Crowe and another female bathed Bertie and put her to bed at 6:30 P.M.Â  Â \r\nDr. Brett Woodard performed an autopsy on Bertie and determined her cause of death to be a subdural hematoma brought on by blunt force trauma to her head.Â  Dr. Woodard found there were twenty or twenty five definite blows sustained by Bertie and estimated that if overlapping blows were calculated, she was struck approximately forty times.Â  While he could not rule out that any single one of Bertieâ€™s injuries were caused by a fall, Dr. Woodard found her injuries to be inconsistent with a fall or multiple falls and consistent with being repeatedly struck during an attack.Â  Dr. Woodard testified that Bertie had defensive wounds on her hands, arms, legs and feet as though she were defending herself from an attack.Â  Further, Dr. Woodard determined to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the subdural hematoma sustained by Bertie was caused by a blow to her head and not a fall.Â  Â Â Â \r\nThere was evidence presented in the form of testimony from multiple witnesses that Crowe had previously been physically abusive to Bertie.Â  One witness testified that three days prior to Bertieâ€™s death, Crowe stated he should kill Bertie for lying to him concerning the fact that she had dated a black man thirty years prior to dating him.Â  \r\nAn Oconee County jury found Crowe guilty of murder, and the trial court sentenced him to forty-seven years imprisonment.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn appellate court will not reverse the trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding jury charges absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law or, when grounded in factual conclusions, is without evidentiary support.â€Â  Id.Â  If any evidence exists to support a jury charge, the trial judge should grant the requested charge.Â  State v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 262, 513 S.E.2d 104, 108 (1999).Â  A refusal to grant a requested jury charge which states a sound principle of law applicable to the case at hand is an error of law.Â  Clark, 339 S.C. at 390, 529 S.E.2d at 539.Â Â  A court should only refuse to charge the jury on manslaughter if there is no evidence tending to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter.Â  State v. Knoten, 347 S.C. 296, 302, 555 S.E.2d 391, 394 (2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nCrowe contends the trial court erred in denying his request to charge the jury on involuntary manslaughter.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n  Involuntary manslaughter is defined as either (1) the killing of another without malice and unintentionally, but while one is engaged in the commission of some unlawful act not amounting to a felony and not naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm; or (2) the killing of another without malice and unintentionally, but while one is acting lawfully, with reckless disregard for the safety of others.\r\n\r\nKnoten, 347 S.C. at 309, 555 S.E.2d at 398.Â  Involuntary manslaughter requires a finding of criminal negligence, which is statutorily defined as a reckless disregard of the safety of others.Â  State v. Crosby, 355 S.C. 47, 52, 584 S.E.2d 110, 112 (2003); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-60 (Supp. 2006).Â  Accordingly, a defendant is entitled to an involuntary manslaughter charge only where the evidence establishes his reckless disregard for the safety of others.Â  \r\nIn this matter, the record fails to establish the necessary elements for a charge of involuntary manslaughter.Â  The first of the above definitions is immediately eliminated from our consideration because in Croweâ€™s account of the events leading to Bertieâ€™s death, there is no evidence that he was engaged in any unlawful act.Â  However, Crowe asserts he was entitled to an involuntary manslaughter charge under the second definition because his continuing to stand Bertie up just so she could fall down again constituted a reckless disregard for her safety.Â  However, there is no evidence in the record that this occurred.[2]Â  The only evidence regarding Croweâ€™s characterizations of his actions with Bertie illustrates an attempt to help her.Â  In fact, Croweâ€™s trial attorney stressed the fact that Crowe should receive a manslaughter charge because he â€œhelpedâ€ Bertie.Â  He stated that â€œbecause of the facts that were brought out as far as helpingâ€ including calling 911, Crowe was entitled to a manslaughter charge.Â  We fail to see how Croweâ€™s account of the events in which he attempted to help Bertie could constitute the reckless disregard for her safety necessary to entitle him to an involuntary manslaughter charge.Â  Because the record demonstrates as a matter of law the absence of a required element of involuntary manslaughter, the trial judge did not err in refusing to charge on that offense.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find no error by the trial court in refusing to charge the jury on involuntary manslaughter.Â  Based on the foregoing, Croweâ€™s conviction is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, KITTREDGE, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] In Croweâ€™s request for an involuntary manslaughter charge, which was held outside the juryâ€™s presence, his attorney stated seeing Bertie fall down repeatedly and not helping would be reckless disregard for her safety.Â  There is no mention of standing her up just so that she could fall down again until it is noted in Croweâ€™s appeal brief.Â  In any event, neither of these assertions appears in the evidence in the record on appeal.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-078","title":"State v.

Peace, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Andre Terrance Auls appeals his convictions for resisting arrest with a deadly weapon, assault and battery with intent to kill (ABWIK),Â  and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent offense.Â  He argues the trial court erred in improperly commenting upon the facts of the case during its instructions to the jury.Â  We affirm.[1]Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn July 31, 2002, four city police officers went to a residence to arrest Andre Terrance Auls.Â  When they arrived, one officer, Peppers, was sent to the back of the residence to ensure that Auls would not flee.Â  The other three officers approached the front porch of the residence and asked Auls to come off the porch and into the front yard to speak with them.Â  Auls complied, and the officers instructed him to put his hands on the hood of the police car.Â  Auls followed the instruction, but the officers testified that when he was told he was being arrested, he stood up, reached behind his back and pulled a gun from the waistband of his pants.Â  A struggle between Auls and the officers ensued, and Officer Atkins was shot in the hip.Â Â  \r\nOfficer Peppers responded from behind the house and called for backup.Â  With Officers Gray and Butler continuing to struggle with Auls, the backup officer (Pratt) arrived and pepper sprayed Auls, whereupon he was subdued.Â  The police arrested Auls and charged him with resisting arrest with a deadly weapon, assault and battery with intent to kill (ABWIK), and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent offense.Â Â Â  \r\nA Greenwood County jury found Auls guilty of all charges.Â  The trial judge sentenced Auls to consecutive prison terms of five years for resisting arrest with a deadly weapon, sixteen years for assault and battery with intent to kill, and five years for possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent offense.[2]Â  This appeal followed. Â Â Â Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.â€ Â State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  An appellate court will not reverse the trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding jury charges absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law or, when grounded in factual conclusions, is without evidentiary support.â€Â  Id.Â  Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAuls contends the trial court erred in its charge to the jury by improperly commenting on the facts of the case.Â  We disagree.\r\nArticle V, Â§ 21 of the South Carolina Constitution states:Â  â€œJudges shall not charge juries in respect to matters of fact, but shall declare the law.â€Â  South Carolina law dictates that a trial judge should refrain from any comment which tends to indicate to the jury his opinion on the credibility of the witnesses, the weight of the evidence, or the guilt of the accused.Â  State v. Jackson, 297 S.C. 523, 526, 377 S.E.2d 570, 572 (1989).Â  However, jury instructions must be considered in their entirety and, if in their entirety, they are free from error, then any potentially misleading portions do not constitute reversible error.Â  Id.Â  Â \r\nAuls objects to the charge to the jury regarding the definitions of â€œassaultâ€ and â€œbatteryâ€ and â€œinferred malice.â€Â  The trial court instructed the jury on the definition of â€œassaultâ€ and â€œbattery,â€ and then utilized the examples of being hit with a baseball bat or being shot with a gun.Â  The court stated:Â  â€œAssault, hit you with the bat, carrying through is the battery.Â  Assault pointing a gun, cocking it, shooting it, bullet enters your body, itâ€™s a battery.Â  Assault and battery.â€Â  The trial court went on to instruct the jury regarding â€œinferred maliceâ€ as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n  What is inferred malice?Â  Thatâ€™s the implication of malice because of the existence or the possession of, for instance, a deadly weapon which is calculated to produce death or serious bodily harm.Â  You have already been told that a deadly weapon or instrument are [sic] weapons which are made or designed for offensive or defensive purposes or from which destruction of life or the infliction of injury may likely occur, one which in the manner used is calculated or likely to produce death or serious bodily injury.\r\n\r\nAuls further notes that the trial court, in its earlier jury instruction regarding the definition of a deadly weapon, specifically noted a â€œfirearmâ€ as being a deadly weapon.Â  Auls believes these instructions are the result of the trial court impermissibly commenting of the facts of the case.\r\nWe conclude that the trial courtâ€™s remarks served only an explanatory function and did not offer an improper comment regarding the facts of the case.Â  The instruction to the jury included several examples of what constitutes both a deadly weapon and an assault and battery, and there was no mention of the specific facts of this case.Â  We find no error with the inferred malice instruction and we note the trial court immediately followed the above quoted inferred malice instruction by stating:\r\n\r\n  If facts are proved beyond a reasonable doubt to your satisfaction sufficient to raise an inference of malice, this inference would simply be an evidentiary fact to be taken into consideration by you the jury, along with any other evidence in the case, and you may give it such weight as you determine it should receive.Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nJust as considering the instruction regarding â€œinferred maliceâ€ in its entirety lends credence to the propriety of the trial courtâ€™s instructions, so too does a consideration of the entire jury instruction.Â  Near the outset of the trial courtâ€™s charge to the jury, the court instructed:\r\n\r\n  If you have drawn any inference from anything the court has done, said, or any ruling the court has made on any motion, movement or acts of the court in any way, then you should disabuse yourself of it.Â  The Court has no interest in the outcome of this trial.Â  The Court has tried to be and hopefully has succeeded in being fair to both parties in this trial.Â  Make nothing of the Courtâ€™s rulings on motions or anything you may have thought indicated the Courtâ€™s feeling about this case or the evidence in this case, completely disabuse yourself of it.Â  \r\n\r\nThe court went on to instruct the jurors that they were the sole finders of fact and the sole judges of credibility and that the court had no right to pass upon the facts of the case.Â  Subsequent to its instructions regarding assault and battery and inferred malice, the trial court again instructed the jury regarding this issue thusly â€œof course you are to draw no inference from the courtâ€™s remarks, as the court has instructed you.â€Â \r\nFurther, this court must ascertain what a reasonable juror would have understood the charge to mean.Â  Jackson, 297 S.C. at 527, 377 S.E.2d at 572.Â  We find it unlikely that a reasonable juror could have singled out this portion of the charge and interpreted it as the courtâ€™s opinion on the facts of this case.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find no error by the trial court in its charge to the jury.Â  Based on the foregoing, Aulsâ€™s conviction is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, KITTREDGE, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n[2] These sentences are also consecutive to the sentence Auls was already serving pursuant to his previous guilty plea for armed robbery.Â  Â \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-079","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., Office of the Attorney General, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Ralph E. Hoisington, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Tyrone Graddick appeals from an Alford plea to the charges of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree (CSC) and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.Â  Graddick argues the plea judge erred in informing him of his right to appeal as that impermissibly converted his Alford plea into a conditional plea, which is disallowed in South Carolina under State v. Truesdale&nbsp; 278 S.C. 368, 370, 296 S.E.2d 528, 529&nbsp;(1982).Â  We disagree, and affirm.[1]Â  Informing a defendant of his right to appeal does not convert an otherwise unconditional plea into a conditional plea. \r\nI.\r\nGraddick was indicted on the charges of CSC, burglary, kidnapping, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.Â  He entered an Alford plea (acknowledging the State had enough evidence to convince a jury of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt) to the CSC and possession of a firearm charges, in exchange for which the State dropped the kidnapping and burglary charges.Â  The trial court accepted the Alford plea.Â  During the plea colloquy, the trial court informed the defendant of his right to file an appeal from his plea.Â  \r\nII.\r\nOn appeal, Graddick argues the judge erred by informing him of his right to appeal from his plea.Â  His argument is that the trial court, by informing him of his right appeal, converted his Alford plea into a conditional plea.Â  Conditional pleas are disallowed in South Carolina, under State v. Truesdale, 278 S.C. 38, 296 S.E. 2d 528 (1982).Â  Graddick therefore argues his plea was invalid and thus should be vacated.Â  \r\nThis argument fails.Â  It is true that conditional pleas are not valid in South Carolina. \r\n\r\n  [A] conditional plea . . . is a practice not recognized in South Carolina and a practice which we expressly disapprove.Â  Pleas of guilty are unconditional, and if an accused attempts to attach any condition or qualification thereto, the trial court should direct a plea of not guilty. \r\n\r\n    Truesdale,&nbsp; 278 S.C. at 370, 296 S.E.2d at 529&nbsp;(citations omitted); see also State v. Downs, 361 S.C. 141, 145, 604 S.E.2d 377, 379 (2004) (citing State v. Peppers, 346 S.C. 502, 505, 552 S.E.2d 288, 290 (2001) (â€œIf the trial court accepts a conditional guilty plea, then the plea will be vacated on appeal.â€)); State v. Oâ€™Leary, 302 S.C. 17, 18, 393 S.E.2d 186, 187 (1990) (â€œGuilty pleas are unconditional and, if an accused attempts to attach any condition, the trial [c]ourt must direct a plea of not guilty.â€). \r\nThere was no conditional plea here, however.Â  The court did not approve any specific conditions on the appeal, nor did the defendant attempt to reserve any specific right to appeal from any particular aspect of his plea.Â  Unlike the defendants in Oâ€™Leary and Peppers, Graddick did not propose to attach, and the plea court did not accept, any specific condition that would have been triggered by the plea courtâ€™s acceptance of the guilty plea.Â  The plea court merely informed Graddick of his general right to appeal. \r\nÂ The mere fact that defendant was informed of his right to appeal does not convert this otherwise unconditional plea into a conditional one.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, KITTREDGE, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-080","title":"State v.

Clare, of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott and Assistant Attorney General Deborah R.J. Shupe, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Edgar Lewis Clements, III, of Florence; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Vasquez Hendon was convicted of two counts of assault with intent to kill and sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment totaling eight years.Â  He appeals, arguing the trial court erred in charging the jury on the law of accomplice liability.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nAround 1:00 a.m. on January 13, 2004, Lieutenant Charlie Watson encountered Hendon and Demetrius Jones walking down Seaboard Avenue in Mullins, South Carolina.Â  Lieutenant Watson spoke to the two men, and he noticed that Hendon was wearing a brown or tan light-colored jacket with a white toboggan/ski mask flipped up on his head like a hat.Â  A few hours later, two men entered the Huddle House restaurant in Mullins, a few blocks from Seaboard Avenue.Â  According to waitress Cynthia Benjamin, the two men ordered food and attempted to bring beer into the restaurant.Â  Benjamin noticed that the man with the lighter skin tone was wearing a white toboggan-type hat rolled up on his head and a brown jacket.Â  After eating their food, the two men left.\r\nBetween 5:00 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. on January 13, 2004, a man entered the Huddle House brandishing a gun, wearing a white ski mask pulled over his face, and wearing a brown jacket.Â  An accomplice stood in the foyer of the restaurant, apparently unarmed.Â  The masked gunman shot at Benjamin, who fled through the back of the restaurant.Â  While the gunman was focused on Benjamin, customer Doug Hooks attempted to escape through the front door.Â  Hooks knocked over and became entangled with the accomplice before running into the parking lot.Â  The gunman chased Hooks and starting shooting at him in the parking lot before the gunman and the accomplice decided to leave.Â  No one was shot in the incident, and it was captured on the Huddle Houseâ€™s video monitoring system.Â  According to Benjamin, the gunman was wearing the same clothes and white tobbaggan/ski mask and had the same build and skin tone as the man who had eaten with his friend at the Huddle House less than two hours earlier that morning.Â Â Â  \r\nPolice later questioned Hendon and Demetrius Jones.Â  Both admitted to being at the scene; however, both accused the other of being the shooter.Â  In Jonesâ€™ oral and written statements accusing Hendon of being the gunman, Jones informed police that Hendon suggested they return to the Huddle House, and Hendon had a gun and a mask over his face as they approached.Â  Jones orally informed police that he was knocked over by Hooks exiting the Huddle House before Jones could enter.Â Â Â Â  \r\nHendon was indicted for attempted armed robbery, two counts of assault with intent to kill, and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.Â  Jones was not charged with any crime. Â Although Jones was a witness for the State at trial, he changed his testimony, saying he did not recall any of the events of that night or giving aÂ  statement to police.Â  Benjamin identified Hendon as the shooter at trial.Â  After all of the evidence, and over the objections of defense counsel, the trial court charged the jury with, among other things, the law of accomplice liability that the â€œhand of one is the hand of all.â€ Â Hendonâ€™s counsel renewed his objection to the accomplice liability charge after all the charges were given.Â Â  \r\nThe jury acquitted Hendon of attempted armed robbery but convicted him of two counts of assault with intent to kill and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.Â  In light of the acquittal on the armed robbery charge, the circuit court directed a verdict of not guilty on the charge of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.Â  Hendon was sentenced to two concurrent terms of eight years on each of the convictions for assault with intent to kill.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHendon argues the trial court erred in charging the jury on the law of accomplice liability because only one person was alleged to have been the shooter and there was no evidence that the non-shooter participated in the crimes.[2]Â  We disagree.\r\nA trial court is required to instruct the jury on the current and correct law of the state.Â  State v. Adkins, 353 S.C. 312, 317, 577 S.E.2d 460, 463 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œThe evidence presented at trial determines the charged jury instruction.â€Â  State v. Blurton, 352 S.C. 203, 207, 573 S.E.2d 802, 804 (2002).Â  If any evidence exists to support a charge, then it should be given.Â  State v. Burris, 334 S.C. 256, 262, 513 S.E.2d 104, 108 (1999).Â  Thus, in reviewing jury instructions for error, â€œwe must consider the courtâ€™s jury charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.â€Â  Adkins, 353 S.C. at 318, 577 S.E.2d at 463.Â  If the charge, as a whole, is reasonably free from error, â€œany isolated portions which may be misleading do not constitute reversible error.â€Â  State v. Buckner, 341 S.C. 241, 246-47, 534 S.E.2d 15, 18 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Where a jury instruction does not fit the facts of the case, however, it may confuse the jury and may constitute error.Â  Blurton, 352 S.C. at 207-08, 573 S.E.2d at 804 (â€œThe purpose of a jury instruction is â€˜to enlighten the jury and to aid it in arriving at a correct verdict.Â  It is error to give instructions which are calculated to confuse or mislead the jury.â€™Â  If a jury instruction is provided to the jury that does not fit the facts of the case, it may confuse the jury.â€)(quoting State v. Leonard, 292 S.C. 133, 137, 355 S.E.2d 270, 273 (1987)).Â  \r\nUnder the theory of accomplice liability, or â€œthe hand of one is the hand of all,â€ one may be criminally liable for the criminal acts of a confederate.Â  To be liable under this theory, â€œa person must personally commit the crime or be present at the scene of the crime and intentionally, or through a common design, aid, abet, or assist in the commission of that crime through some overt act.â€Â  State v. Austin, 299 S.C. 456, 459, 385 S.E.2d 830, 832 (1989).Â  There need not be a formally expressed agreement to establish the conspiracy; the conspiracy may be shown by the conduct of the parties and circumstantial evidence.Â  State v. Condrey, 349 S.C. 184, 194, 562 S.E.2d 320, 325 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nIn determining whether the accomplice liability charge was warranted in this case, our focus must be on whether there was any evidence that Hendon and Jones were acting together at the time of the shooting.Â  Jones informed police that after the two men decided to return to the Huddle House, Hendon approached the restaurant with his gun and wearing a mask over his face.Â  Hooks testified that the non-shooter was standing in the foyer of the Huddle House during the shooting.Â  Both Hendon and Jones admitted to being present at the crime scene.Â  Thus, the two were together before, during and after the shooting.Â  It can be inferred, from the conduct of the two men and the circumstances, that both men knew of the plan to rob the Huddle House and that the non-gunman, who was waiting in the foyer, would act as a lookout.Â  Although it is troubling that the accomplice liability charge was given when Jones was not charged in this crime, this fact does not control our analysis of whether there was evidence to support the accomplice liability charge.Â  Because there was circumstantial evidence to support the charge, we find no error with the trial courtâ€™s decision to give the charge.Â  \r\nFurther, even assuming it was error to give the accomplice liability charge, we find such error would be harmless.Â  Both Lieutenant Watson and Benjamin identified Hendon as wearing the same clothing and hat as the gunman on the morning of the shooting.Â  Benjamin also pointed to Hendon and positively identified him as the shooter at trial based on his clothing, skin tone, and build.Â  Despite the fact that he recanted at trial, Jones gave statements to police that Hendon was the shooter.Â  Because there was competent evidence that would support the guilty verdict against Hendon, we find an alleged error in instructing the jury on the law of accomplice liability is harmless.Â  State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1999) (holding that an insubstantial error not affecting the result of the trial is harmless where â€œguilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion can be reachedâ€).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThere was circumstantial evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s decision to give the accomplice liability charge.Â  Further, even assuming the trial court erred in giving the charge, that error was harmless in light of the evidence presented at trial.Â  Thus, Hendonâ€™s convictions and sentences are\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Hendon does not complain about the substance of the charge given.Â  Therefore, we will confine our analysis to whether there was evidence presented at trial that would support an accomplice liability charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-081","title":"Schneider v.

Schneider, on behalf of himself and others similarly situated, cross-appeal a jury verdict in favor of Schneider on his class action suit against the Board for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty arising from its management of the Bohicket Marina Village Horizontal Property Regime.Â  We affirm.\r\nI. The Boardâ€™s Appeal\r\nWe decline to address the Boardâ€™s contentions that the circuit court erred by: (1) refusing to dismiss Schneiderâ€™s suit for failure to comply with Rule 23(b)(1), SCRCP, and (2) qualifying Schneiderâ€™s expert on community associations, governments, and board responsibilities.Â  We hold that the Board did not present a sufficient record for appellate review on these issues.Â  Substantial portions of the proceedings belowâ€”especially portions related to the Boardâ€™s assignments of errorâ€”are not included in the record on appeal.Â  See Webb v. CSX Transp., Inc., 364 S.C. 639, 655, 615 S.E.2d 440, 449&nbsp;(2005) (â€œIt is the\r\nappellantâ€™s burden to present a sufficient record for appellate review.â€); Connolly v. Peopleâ€™s Life Ins. Co. of S.C., 299 S.C. 348, 352, 384 S.E.2d 738, 740&nbsp;(1989) (recognizing an appellate court should not be left to â€œâ€˜grope in the dark,â€™ searching the entire record to ascertain the issue being raisedâ€); Hundley v. Rite Aid of S.C., Inc., 339 S.C. 285, 306-07, 529 S.E.2d 45, 57&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000) (holding appellants bear the burden of providing this court with a record sufficient to allow appellate review). \r\nWe affirm the following remaining preserved issues raised by the Board.Â  First, we hold the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in refusing to either decertify the class or remove Schneider as the class representative.Â  â€œ[A] trial judgeâ€™s ruling on whether an action is properly maintainable as a class action is within his discretion.â€Â  Waller v. Seabrook Island Property Owners Assâ€™n, 300 S.C. 465, 468, 388 S.E.2d 799, 801 (1990).Â  Rule 23(a)(4), SCRCP, provides that â€œthe representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class[.]â€Â  Although a close question is presented, to the extent the record addresses this issue, we find no abuse of discretion. \r\nSecond, the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in allowing expert testimony from Marshal Clarke, a forensic architect, concerning the increased repair costs to the Regime from 1994 to 2004.Â  See Fields v. Regâ€™l Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 25, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509&nbsp;(2005) (â€œQualification of an expert and the admission or exclusion of his testimony is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial judge.â€); Mizell v. Glover, 351 S.C. 392, 406, 570 S.E.2d 176, 183&nbsp;(2002) (â€œA trial courtâ€™s ruling to exclude or admit expert testimony will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion.â€).Â  An expert witness may state an opinion based on facts not within his first-hand knowledge, and may base his opinion on information, whether or not admissible, made available to him before the hearing if the information is of the type reasonably relied upon in the field.Â  Rule 703, SCRE.Â  Defects in an expert witnessâ€™s education and experience go to the weight, rather than the admissibility, of the expertâ€™s testimony.Â  Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., 326 S.C. 248, 253, 487 S.E.2d 596, 598&nbsp;(1997).Â  Furthermore, we find any error by the trial judge would be harmless because Clarkeâ€™s testimony concerning costs estimates was cumulative to the same evidence that was earlier admitted without objection.Â  See Guffey v. Columbia/Colleton Regâ€™l Hosp., Inc., 364 S.C. 158, 170, 612 S.E.2d 695, 701&nbsp;(2005) (explaining appellate court should review error in admission or exclusion of evidence to determine if it is harmless because equivalent or cumulative evidence was admitted).Â  \r\nThird, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s refusal to direct a verdict based on the statute of limitations defense.Â  Conflicting evidence was presented to the jury, and the trial court properly presented the matter to the jury by way of a special interrogatory.Â  See Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 563, 633 S.E.2d 505, 509 (2006) (â€œIf the evidence as a whole is susceptible of more than one reasonable inference, a jury issue is created and the [directed verdict] motion should have been denied.â€); see also Sabb v. S.C. State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002) (â€œIn ruling on directed verdict or JNOV motions, the trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motions.â€).\r\n\r\n    II. Schneiderâ€™s Appeal\r\nSchneider presented two claimsâ€”negligence and breach of fiduciary dutyâ€”to the jury.Â  The jury was instructed to â€œdecide each cause of action on the evidence and the law applicable to it, uninfluenced by your decision as to the other cause of action.â€Â  The charge further informed the jury: â€œyou will be asked to write a verdict for each cause of action.â€Â  There was no exception taken to the jury charge and the parties agree that the courtâ€™s instruction required the jury to consider each cause of action separately in terms of liability and damages.Â  The jury returned verdicts in favor of Schneider on each cause of action, and each verdict form reflected $1,250,000 in damages.Â  Upon receipt of the verdict, but prior to discharge of the jury, Schneider moved the trial court to have the jury â€œclarifyâ€ whether it determined total damages to be $1,250,000 or $2,500,000.Â  Because the jury was instructed to decide each cause of action separately and â€œuninfluencedâ€ by the juryâ€™s consideration of the other cause of action, the trial court accepted the facially valid verdict forms and discharged the jury.\r\nThe Board moved to require Schneider to make an election of remedies.Â  Schneider opposed the motion to elect remedies and submitted the affidavits of five jurors.[1]Â  Each juror affidavit asserts that â€œ[i]t was definitely my intent for Plaintiff and Class to receive a total award of $2,500,000â€ and that â€œI believed it was necessary to divide in half the award.â€Â  The trial court declined to consider the juror affidavits and required Schneider to make an election of remedies.Â  Judgment was entered for Schneider for $1,250,000.Â  On appeal, Schneider claims error in the election of remedies and asks us to make a finding that the juryâ€”all twelve jurorsâ€”intended to award total damages of $2,500,000 and that judgment be entered in favor of Schneider for $2,500,000.Â  Schneider does not seek a new trial.\r\nWhile we are sympathetic with Schneiderâ€™s predicament, we are unable to grant the relief he requests.Â  This matter could have been easily and quickly resolved had the trial court permitted the jury to clarify its verdict. The trial court certainly had the authority to seek clarification from the jury as to its intent concerning damages.Â  The record reveals that when this very issue was anticipated by Schneider prior to jury deliberations, the trial court apparently acquiesced in Schneiderâ€™s counselâ€™s suggestion that â€œif [the jury] come[s] back with a verdict, we can send a question in, I guess, and clear it up then.â€Â  When the time came to remove any uncertainty with the juryâ€™s verdict, the trial court discharged the jury.Â  Yet we are certainly in no position to make a finding as to the juryâ€™s intent consistent with the view advocated by Schneider.Â  Even assuming we were to accept at face value the affidavits of the five jurors (which the Board did not have an opportunity to challenge), we do not know the intent of the other seven jurors.Â  \r\nIn rejecting Schneiderâ€™s challenge, we are mindful that the verdict forms are facially valid.Â  More to the point, the jury was instructed to reach a verdict as to each cause of action separately.Â  We find no error in the trial courtâ€™s refusal to consider the juror affidavits.Â  The position of the trial court is supported by Rule 606(b), SCRE, and case law.Â  State v. Hunter, 320 S.C. 85, 88, 463 S.E.2d 314, 316&nbsp;(1995) (â€œAs a general rule, juror testimony may not be the basis for impeaching a jury verdict.â€); Barsh v. Chrysler Corp., 262 S.C. 129, 135, 203 S.E.2d 107, 109&nbsp;(1974) (â€œSince litigation must be finalized, the courts have, as a policy matter, adopted the rule of refusing to allow the testimony of a juror to impeach the verdict.â€).Â  Rule 606(b) does not permit a juror to â€œtestify as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the juryâ€™s deliberations.â€Â  Rule 606(b) does permit a juror to â€œtestify on the question whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the juryâ€™s attention or whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror,â€ but there is no such allegation here.Â  In light of Schneiderâ€™s request that we make a finding as to the juryâ€™s intent concerning the amount of damages based the affidavits of the five jurors, we find no error in the entry of judgment in accordance with the juryâ€™s facially valid verdict. \r\nWe also find no error in the ruling of the circuit court requiring an election of remedies.Â  Again, Schneider seeks to avoid the facially valid verdict of the jury.Â  The above discussion concerning the charge to the jury and the form of the verdict applies to this related assignment of error.Â  Moreover, we note that Schneiderâ€™s claims against the Board arise from the same set of factsâ€”the Boardâ€™s administration and maintenance of the Regime property.Â  The trial court properly required an election of remedies in this case where two causes of action went to the jury on an identical set of facts. Â See Tomlinson v. Mixon, 367 S.C. 467, 470, 626 S.E.2d 43, 44-45 (Ct. App. 2006) (holding the purpose of the doctrine of election of remedies â€œis to prevent double redress for a single wrong.â€); see also Inman v. Imperial Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 303 S.C. 10, 15, 397 S.E.2d 774, 777 (Ct. App. 1990) (â€œ[T]he trial judge should on his own motion require election if he lets both causes of action go to the jury.â€). Â Â \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, J.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The record does not indicate if the remaining seven jurors were contacted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-082","title":"Sochko v.

Speedy, of Camden, for Appellant- Respondent.\r\nThomas F. McDow, of Rock Hill, for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this domestic action, Lisa Sochko (Wife) appeals the order of the family court distributing $120,000 she and Jeffrey Sochko (Husband) received when they settled a claim for stucco damage to their home.Â  Husband also appeals the family courtâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn November 23, 1999, after fourteen years of marriage, Wife instituted this action for divorce.Â  Wife sought custody of the partiesâ€™ three children, child support, equitable apportionment of the marital property, and attorneyâ€™s fees and costs. Â Husband answered, seeking alimony, custody, equitable apportionment and divorce based upon Wifeâ€™s adultery.[2] Â Â Â \r\nOn December 13, 1999, the family court issued a temporary order awarding joint custody to both parents, with Wife as the primary custodian.Â  Husband was ordered to pay $444 per month in child support.Â  Shortly thereafter, Husband filed a motion seeking to transfer custody to him, which the family court denied.Â  On September 22, 2000, Wife filed a rule to show cause against Husband for failure to pay child support. Â By the time of the hearing, Husband had paid close to $800 and made provisions to pay the past arrearages.Â  \r\nThereafter, numerous motions were filed, including a motion by Wife, which was granted by the family court, to have the guardian ad litem removed.Â  In 2001, with trial only days away, Husband replaced his attorney and received a continuance.Â  \r\nBy the time the case was set for trial, in February of 2002, the parties had settled many of the issues, including the issue of custody, which had been the primary source of the partiesâ€™ disagreement.Â  The parties agreed to joint custody with Wife being the primary custodian.Â  After trial, the family court issued the parties a divorce based upon the ground of one years separation.Â  Further, the family court ordered Husband to pay child support and denied his request for alimony. Â The court found neither party was entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nBoth parties filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to have the family court reconsider its divorce decree.Â  Specifically, Wife argued the judge had failed to consider Husbandâ€™s actions in prolonging the litigation.Â  By order dated August 5, 2002, the family court awarded Wife attorneyâ€™s fees; however, the court denied Husbandâ€™s motion.Â  \r\nAlthough the record is somewhat unclear, it appears the divorce was bifurcated, leaving the issue of the marital home to be decided later due to ongoing litigation involving stucco damage to the home.Â  The parties eventually settled their stucco claim for $120,000.Â  \r\nAt the September 11, 2003 hearing, the parties agreed that the equity in the marital home would be divided in half, with Wife receiving ownership of the house.Â  Therefore, the only issues left to determine were the outstanding liens on the home and the apportionment of the stucco settlement.Â  During the hearing, Wife attempted to introduce Charles Burns, Jr., the contractor who performed the stucco repairs, as a witness.Â  Husband objected based on the ground Wife did not list Burns as a witness.Â  The family court sustained the objection.Â  Additionally, the court allowed Wife to argue that $14,000 the parties received from her father for down payment for their home was a loan, and thus marital debt subject to equitable apportionment.Â  Husband maintained the money was a gift.Â  \r\nOn November 11, 2003, the family court issued its final order, finding the cost of the stucco repairs amounted to $40,150.Â  After assessing the equity in the home, the mortgage indebtedness, the repairs performed on the home, and the remaining stucco settlement, the judge found Wife was required to pay Husband $3,696.85 as his share of apportionment of the house.Â  In reaching this figure, the family court considered that Husband already had possession of $38,613.39, which amounted to his share of the stucco settlement after attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  \r\nHusband filed a Rule 59(e) motion, arguing the family court erred in assessing the value of the marital home and stucco settlement.Â  Husband argued the equity in the home and the stucco settlement should be apportioned separately and the family court agreed.Â  In its amended final order, the family court, cognizant that under the new order Wife owed a substantially larger amount than under the previous order, found Husband was entitled to $42,310 for his share of the equity in the house and stucco settlement.Â  Both parties appeal.Â  Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family court, this court has the authority to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 283, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002); Lanier v. Lanier, 364 S.C. 211, 215, 612 S.E.2d 456, 458 (Ct. App. 2005); Nasser-Moghaddassi v. Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. 182, 189, 612 S.E.2d 707, 711 (Ct. App. 2005); Emery v. Smith, 361 S.C. 207, 213, 603 S.E.2d 598, 601 (Ct. App. 2004) (citing Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 414 S.E.2d 157 (1992)).Â  This broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings, and we remain mindful of the fact that the family court, who saw and heard the parties, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign weight to their testimony.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981); Holler v. Holler, 364 S.C. 256, 261, 612 S.E.2d 469, 472 (Ct. App. 2005); see also Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 477 S.E.2d 476 (Ct. App. 1996) (stating that because the appellate court lacks the opportunity to directly observe the witnesses, it should accord great deference to the\r\nfamily courtâ€™s findings where matters of credibility are involved).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Wifeâ€™s Appeal\r\nA. Judicial Estoppel \r\nWife argues the family court erred in assessing only $40,150, the amount the parties paid to repair the stucco damage to the house, as the stucco damage.Â  Wife maintains even though the amount to repair the damage was $40,150, under the doctrine of judicial estoppel, Husband is estopped from claiming the stucco damage to the house was less than $120,000, the amount the parties received as the settlement of the stucco claim.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, we note the argument relating to judicial estoppel is not preserved for our review.Â  To preserve an issue for appellate review, the issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the family court.Â \r\nCharleston County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Jackson,&nbsp;368 S.C. 87, 104-05, 627 S.E.2d 765, 775&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006) (citing Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (â€œIt is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.â€)); Jones v. Daley, 363 S.C. 310, 315, 609 S.E.2d 597, 599 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Wife did not raise this argument to the family court.Â  Additionally, Wife did not raise this issue in her rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion.Â  Therefore, this issue is not preserved.Â Â  See Washington v. Washington, 308 S.C. 549, 551, 419 S.E.2d 779, 781 (1992) (holding when an appellant neither raises an issue at trial nor through a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion to amend, the issue is not properly presented to an appellate court for review); Hailey v. Hailey, 357 S.C. 18, 24, 590 S.E.2d 495, 498 (Ct. App. 2003) (finding Wife did not raise argument that Husband was judicially estopped from raising issue of decrease of alimony to family court and thus, issue was not preserved for appellate review).\r\nEven if the issue was preserved, we find judicial estoppel inapplicable under the facts of this case. Under the doctrine of judicial estoppel, Wife contends Husband maintained two inconsistent positions.Â  During the stucco litigation, Husband maintained the damage to the house was $120,000, and in the current action he maintains the damage was only $40,150.Â  The doctrine of judicial estoppel â€œis an equitable concept that prevents a litigant from asserting a position inconsistent with, or in conflict with, one the litigant has previously asserted in the same or related proceeding.â€Â Â  Cothran v. Brown, 357 S.C. 210, 215, 592 S.E.2d 629, 631 (2004) (citing Colleton Reg. Hosp. v. MRS Med. Rev. Systs., 866 F.Supp. 896, 900 (D.S.C. 1994)). The purpose of judicial estoppel is â€œâ€˜to protect the integrity of the courts rather than to protect litigants from allegedly improper or deceitful conduct by their adversaries.â€™â€Â  Hawkins v. Bruno Yacht Sales, 353 S.C. 31, 42, 577 S.E.2d 202, 208 (2003) (quoting Hayne Fed. Credit Union v. Bailey, 327 S.C. 242, 251, 489 S.E.2d 472, 477 (1997)). Â \r\nFurther, â€œ[b]ecause judicial estoppel is an equitable concept, depending upon the facts and circumstances of each\r\nindividual case, application of the doctrine is discretionary.â€ Carrigg v. Cannon,&nbsp;347 S.C. 75, 83-84, 552 S.E.2d 767, 772&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001) (citing Hawkins v. Bruno Yacht Sales, 342 S.C. 352, 368, 536 S.E.2d 698, 706 (Ct. App, 2000)); see also Allen v. Zurich Ins. Co., 667 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir. 1982) (â€œobserving\r\njudicial estoppel should be applied with cautionâ€); 28 Am. Jur. 2d Estoppel &amp; Waiver Â§ 75 (2000) (â€œnoting\r\njudicial estoppel is an equitable concept that must be applied with caution and in the narrowest of circumstances at the discretion of the trial courtâ€)).Â  In order for judicial estoppel to apply in a given case, the following elements must be met:\r\n\r\n  (1) two inconsistent positions taken by the same party or parties in privity with one another; (2) the positions must\r\nbe taken in the same or related proceedings involving the same party or parties in privity with each other; (3) the party taking the position must have been successful in maintaining that position and have received some benefit; (4) the inconsistency must be part of an intentional effort to mislead the court; and (5) the two positions must be totally inconsistent. \r\n\r\nCothran, 357 S.C. at 216, 592 S.E.2d at 631 (citing Carrigg v. Cannon, 347 S.C. 75, 83, 552 S.E.2d 767, 772 (Ct. App. 2001)).\r\nDuring the stucco litigation, Husband and Wife both claimed the damage to the house was over $120,000, and the parties agreed to settle for that amount.Â  Subsequently, Wife made $69,800 worth of repairs to the home, $40,150 of which were found to be repairs to the house due to stucco damage. \r\nWe find the family court properly concluded the cost to repair the stucco damage was the correct way to assess the damage to the house.Â  Therefore, the court properly divided the remaining portion of the settlement between the parties.Â  If we were to adopt the approach urged by Wife and allow her to receive the entire stucco settlement despite the fact that the repairs were significantly less, then she would receive a windfall and Husband would be denied his rightful share of the settlement.Â  \r\nMoreover, we find judicial estoppel does not apply to the facts of this case.Â  The theory of judicial estoppel is premised upon the notion that allowing a party to enter a court of law asserting a factual position inconsistent with a position taken earlier in a related action demeans the entire judicial process.Â  In this case, we can discern no threat to the integrity of the court by allowing Husband to receive his share of the benefit that the cost to repair the stucco was less then the settlement amount.Â  In fact, we find a substantial injustice would occur if Wife were allowed to retain the remaining settlement amount when the house itself was marital property, and therefore subject to equitable distribution.Â  See Carrigg v. Cannon,&nbsp;347 S.C. 75, 84, 552 S.E.2d 767, 772&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001) (â€œThe discretionary nature of\r\njudicial estoppel is such that it should not be applied if doing so would work â€œan injustice against the party being estopped while simultaneously subverting the\r\njudicial process.â€).Â  Accordingly, we decline to apply judicial estoppel to this action and find the family court properly assessed the stucco damages.\r\nB. Marital Home\r\n\r\n Wife argues the family court erred in its valuation of the marital home.Â  Wife contends the family court erroneously failed to consider the stucco damage in assessing the homeâ€™s value.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen making an equitable distribution of marital property, the\r\nfamily court must identify marital property and determine the fair market value of the property. Cannon v. Cannon, 321 S.C. 44, 48, 467 S.E.2d 132, 134 (Ct. App. 1996); Noll v. Noll, 297 S.C. 190, 192, 375 S.E.2d 338, 340 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  The\r\nfamily court is entitled to â€œbroad discretion in valuing the marital property.â€ Pirri v. Pirri, 631 S.E.2d 279, 283&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006) (citing Roe v. Roe, 311 S.C. 471, 478, 429 S.E.2d 830, 835 (Ct. App. 1993)).Â  The valuation of the family court â€œwill\r\nbe affirmed on appeal if the valuation is within the range of values presented by the parties.â€Â Â  Avery v. Avery,&nbsp; 370 S.C. 304, 314, 634 S.E.2d 668, 673&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006) (citing Woodward v. Woodward, 294 S.C. 210, 215, 363 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. App. 1987) (affirming the valuation of property in the range of evidence presented)).\r\nThe final order provides, â€œThe value of the house for purposes of the division as of the date of filing is $251,000, a figure which assumes all repairs to any existing stucco damage.â€Â  In determining the value of the house, the family court had three different appraisals to choose from.Â  All of the expertsâ€™ appraisals of the house included a value which assumed the stucco was fully repaired and the appraisals ranged from $251,000 to $275,000.Â  The family court chose the lowest appraisal, which actually benefited Wife because the parties agreed she would receive the house, and, therefore, the amount she had to pay to Husband as equity was less than it would have been had the family court used a higher appraisal.Â  Further, the final order clearly states it considered the stucco damage in assessing the value of the house.Â  Accordingly, we find the family court did not abuse its discretion in valuing the marital home.Â  \r\nNext, Wife argues the family court erred in assessing the equity in the marital home.Â  Wife maintains the family court failed to consider the stucco damage was $120,000, and, therefore, erroneously found the equity in the home to be $129,595.22 rather than $9,595.22.Â  Because we find the family court properly assessed the stucco damage, we find no error in the courtâ€™s assessment of the equity in the home.[3]Â  \r\nC.Â  Stucco Settlement \r\nWife argues the family court erred in its division of the stucco settlement.Â  We disagree. \r\nIn the final order, the family court appraised the house after the stucco repairs at $251,000 and then subtracted $121,404.78, the amount of mortgage indebtedness, and $40,150, the cost of the stucco repairs.Â  The family court also subtracted $4,825.22 for litigation costs Wife had advanced.Â  After all of the deductions, the family court arrived at $84,620, divided that amount by two and found each party was entitled to $42,310.Â  Because Husband and Wife had previously split $38,613.39 of the stucco settlement, Wife was only required to pay Husband $3,696.85 as his share of the division of the marital house and settlement.Â  \r\nIn the amended final order, the family court assessed the equity in the house and the stucco settlement separately.Â  The family court subtracted the mortgage indebtedness from the houseâ€™s value in order to establish the equity in the house, which was $129,595.22, with each party entitled to $64,797.61.Â  The family court then took the stucco settlement and subtracted attorneyâ€™s fees to arrive at $77,226.28.Â  The family court then subtracted $40,150 for the repairs to the stucco and $4,825.22 for litigation costs advanced by Wife for a total of $32,251.06, with each party entitled to $16,125.53.Â  The family court then added each partyâ€™s share of the house equity and the left over settlement amount and established that each party was entitled to $80,923.14.Â  The family court reasoned that because Husband had already received $38,613.14[4] from the stucco settlement, it subtracted that amount from the $80,923.14 Husband was entitled.Â  Thus, the family court concluded Wife was required to pay Husband an additional $42,310. \r\nWe can perceive of no error in the mathematical formula utilized by the family court in the amended final order.Â  In the final order, the court utilized a formula for division of the stucco settlement that, in essence, awarded the entire settlement to Wife for use in repairing the house and then subtracted the amount received by Husband from the settlement from what would have been his share of the equity in the house.Â  The formula used in the final order fails to consider the fact the stucco settlement was substantially larger than the cost to repair the stucco damage.Â  By assessing the equity in the house and stucco settlement separately, the court ensured that each party was awarded their fair share of both.Â  Accordingly, we find the family court properly divided the stucco settlement.Â  \r\nD.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exclusion of Testimony \r\nWife alleges the family court erred in excluding the testimony of Charles Burns, Jr., the contractor who repaired the stucco damage to the home, as a witness.Â  By excluding the testimony, Wife maintains she was unable to establish how much of the $68,800 worth of repairs she made to the home were related to the stucco damage.Â  For the reasons set forth below, we decline to reach this issue. \r\nDuring the hearing, Wife introduced Burns as a witness and Husband objected on the ground that he was not aware Burns was going to testify.Â  Further, Husband complained the repairs were done without his permission and he was not given an opportunity to have an expert assess the damage to the house.Â  The family court sustained the objection, finding Burns was not listed to testify and excluded him as a witness.Â  After the family court dismissed Burns, Wife did not make a follow-up proffer of the testimony. Â Without an adequate proffer, there is nothing before us to review.Â  See McKissick v. J.F. Cleckley &amp; Co.,&nbsp;325 S.C. 327, 349, 479 S.E.2d 67, 78&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996) (finding that absent a proffer of the excluded testimony, there is nothing before the court to review); Vaughn v. City of Anderson,&nbsp;300 S.C. 55, 59-60, 386 S.E.2d 297, 300&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1989) (â€œThere was no proffer of the testimony. Without the proffer of the testimony there is nothing for this court to review.â€).Â  \r\nThe record before us is devoid of any showing of what the excluded testimony would have been, and, therefore, we cannot determine any prejudice Wife suffered.Â  Accordingly, even if the family court did err in excluding the testimony, Wife has failed to show any prejudice she suffered because all the record reveals is that Burns performed the repairs.Â  See Vaughn, 300 S.C. at 58, 386 S.E.2d at 299 (Ct. App. 1989) (â€œA ruling on the admission of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion and a showing of prejudice.â€) (citing Manning v. City of Columbia, 297 S.C. 451, 377 S.E.2d 335 (1989)).\r\nE. Loan from Wifeâ€™s Father\r\nWife alleges the family court erred in finding the parties were not obligated to pay Wifeâ€™s father $14,000 that he loaned to the parties to purchase their home.Â  Wife contends the family court erroneously concluded the $14,000 was not marital debt subject to equitable apportionment.Â  We disagree. Â \r\nWhen the parties purchased their home, Wifeâ€™s father gave them $42,500, which Wife maintains is a loan and Husband maintains is a gift.Â  Wife and Husband still had to finance the rest of the purchase price.Â  Towards that end, Wifeâ€™s father wrote a letter to First Federal Bank which provided:\r\n\r\nI am writing you to inform you that I am giving my daughter Lisa Dietz Sochko and her family a gift of $42,500.00 to purchase a new home . . . . I am pleased to be in a position to help my daughter and I am not expecting her to re-pay me.Â  This is not a loan but instead a gift!Â  Her house is presently on the market for sale.Â  If it does not sell by the time of the final closing on the new construction, I will make all mortgage payments for her until it is sold.\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter, Wife wrote a letter to her dad, dated May 10, 1999, signed by her and Husband which stated:\r\n\r\nJeff and I will pay you the full amount that you lend [sic] us for the house $42,500.Â  We will also be totally responsible for making our other mortgage payment in case it doesnâ€™t sell.Â  Thank you so much for this loan. Â We appreciate it more then we can tell you.\r\n\r\nWhen the partiesâ€™ house sold, they returned $28,500 to Wifeâ€™s father, leaving an alleged $14,000 balance.Â  \r\nThe family court found the two letters were contradictory, because the official statement made to the lender characterized the money as a gift, while the unofficial letter characterized the transfer of funds as a loan.Â  The court concluded that the contradictory nature of the letters allowed the parties to characterize the transfer of funds in anyway which suited their purpose.Â  The court refused to â€œindulge the parties in this exercise.â€Â  Further, the judge found the money had not been repaid in ten years nor was there any evidence of any repayment schedule.Â  Accordingly, he declined to find the money was marital debt.Â  \r\nWe find the family court properly found the money was not a loan, and therefore, not subject to equitable apportionment as marital debt.Â  Wifeâ€™s father wrote an official letter to a lending institution claiming the money was a gift.Â  If the money was in fact a loan, then all of the parties involved defrauded the lender.Â  In light of the conflicting evidence on the subject, this court will not be involved in characterizing the transfer of funds in anyway that is different than what Wifeâ€™s father presented officially to the lending institution.Â  In our view, a party cannot engage in chicanery in order to obtain financing and then later claim, in a court of law, a position contrary to the one officially taken.Â  Therefore, we find no error by the family court on this point. \r\nF.Â  Wifeâ€™s Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nWife argues that if she is successful on appeal, this court should reverse the family courtâ€™s order finding she was not entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees for the September 11, 2003 hearing.Â  She concedes that if she is unsuccessful, then the family court correctly decided the issue.Â  Because we affirm the order of the family court, we find the family court properly found Wife was not entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees for the September hearing.Â  Â \r\nII. Â Â Â Â  Husbandâ€™s Appeal\r\n\r\n Husband alleges the family court erred in awarding Wife attorneyâ€™s fees for the trial on February 4, 5, and 6, 2002.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 20-3-120 of the South Carolina Code (1985) authorizes the family court to order payment of suit money, including attorneyâ€™s fees, to either party in an action for divorce.Â  The family court is awarded broad discretion in deciding whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees and its decision will not be overturned on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 553, 559 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004); Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 365, 384 S.E.2d 741, 478 (1989); Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, 415, 368 S.E.2d 901, 903&nbsp;(1988).\r\nSouth Carolina case law and court rules make clear that when a statute permits an award of attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court must make specific findings of fact on the record\r\nfor each of the required factors to be considered.Â \r\nGriffith v. Griffith,&nbsp;332 S.C. 630, 646, 506 S.E.2d 526, 534-35&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1998) (quoting Rule 26(a), SCRFC) (â€œAn order or judgment pursuant to an adjudication in a domestic relations case shall set forth the specific findings of fact and conclusions of law to support the courtâ€™s decision.â€).Â  In general, where a family court order fails to comply with Rule 26(a), an appellate court â€œshould reverse and remand so the Family Court may make specific findings of fact.â€Â  Badeaux v. Davis,&nbsp;337 S.C. 195, 202-03, 522 S.E.2d 835, 839&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1999) (citing Blumberg v. Nealco, Inc., 310 S.C. 492, 427 S.E.2d 659 (1993)). â€œHowever, when an order from the family court is issued in violation of Rule 26(a), SCRFC, the\r\nappellate court â€˜may remand the matter to the [family] court or, where the record is sufficient, make its own findings of fact in accordance with the preponderance of the evidence.â€™â€Â  Griffith,&nbsp;332 S.C. at 646-47, 506 S.E.2d at 535 (citation omitted).Â  \r\nAdditionally, in Glasscock v. Glasscock, the South Carolina Supreme Court clarified the six factors used to determine whether attorneyâ€™s fees are warranted in a given case:\r\n\r\n(1) nature, extent, and difficulty of the case;\r\n(2) time necessarily devoted to the case;\r\n(3) professional standing of counsel;\r\n(4) contingency of compensation\r\n(5) beneficial results obtained;\r\n(6) customary legal fees for similar services\r\n\r\n304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).Â  Â \r\nIn the present case, the family court initially found Wife was not entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  After Wife filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to reconsider, the family court awarded her attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The family court found Wife was entitled to the fees she incurred for Husbandâ€™s failure to pay child support after the initial temporary hearing, for issues relating to the removal of the first guardian ad litem, and for issues relating to the valuation of property.Â  Additionally, the court found Wife was entitled to fees incurred because of the delays Husband caused by having three different attorneys throughout the course of the litigation. \r\nThe family court noted Husbandâ€™s last change of attorneys occurred within days of the scheduled trial, after Wifeâ€™s attorney had already prepared for trial and had issued service of subpoenas for witnesses.Â  The judge found Husband prolonged the litigation and created unnecessary costs for Wife.Â  The judge stated that although Wife had no greater ability to pay fees than Husband, the failure to award her fees and costs would have the effect of significantly reducing the value of her equitable division through no fault of her own and of rewarding Husband for his actions. Â The court therefore found Wife was entitled to fees and, accordingly, awarded her a â€œreasonable sumâ€ of $10,500 in attorneyâ€™s fees based upon seventy hours at the rate of $150 per hour.\r\nDespite the fact the family court did not specifically refer to Glasscock and that we believe the courtâ€™s order to be weak, we nonetheless find it sufficient to sustain the award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife.Â  The family court considered many of the factors, and focused primarily on the fact Husbandâ€™s activities, including his failure to pay child support and hiring a new attorney days before trial was set to commence, caused Wife to incur unnecessary expenses.Â  Therefore, we hold the record is sufficient to affirm the family courtâ€™s order.Â  Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find Wifeâ€™s argument regarding judicial estoppel is not preserved for appeal.Â  Even if the argument had been preserved, judicial estoppel is not applicable to the facts of this case.Â  Moreover, the family court did not err in its valuation of the marital home or in its distribution of the stucco settlement.Â  We also find due to Wifeâ€™s failure to proffer the expert testimony, we cannot review whether the family court erred in excluding the testimony.Â  Additionally, we find the court correctly characterized the loan from Wifeâ€™s father as a gift.Â  Finally, we find the judge did not err in requiring Husband to pay Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, KITTREDGE, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  The record is somewhat meager of facts relating to the events leading up to the divorce.Â  Further, the parties did not include the complaint and answer in the record.Â  \r\n[3] The equity in the house and its division are more fully discussed below.Â  \r\n[4] The final order provides Husband already received 38,613.14, instead of $38,613.39, no reason is given for this small discrepancy. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-083","title":"Rapid Industries v.

Warr, Jr., Special Referee\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-083\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2007 â€“ Filed February 15, 2007Â Â Â \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nRobert D. McKissick, of Florence, for Appellant.\r\nD. Kenneth Baker, of Darlington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this action for breach of a commercial lease, Charles R. Wingate, Jr. appeals the special refereeâ€™s award of damages to Rapid Industries, Inc. (Landlord).Â  Wingate argues the special referee erred in finding Landlord mitigated its damages and summarily awarding attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 26, 2000, Landlord entered into a lease agreement with Industrial Service Works, Inc. (Tenant).Â  Tenant agreed to lease from Landlord certain land with an office, warehouse, and truck scale.Â  The lease sets rent at $1,000 a month and covers three years, from June 1, 2000 to May 31, 2003.Â  In addition, Landlord is authorized to collect a 15% late fee and attorneyâ€™s fees in the event Tenant defaults.Â  Wingate and William Benjamin Streett guaranteed the lease.[2]Â Â Â  \r\nTenant made two lease payments and subsequently defaulted.Â  On December 16, 2002, Landlord filed a complaint against Tenant, Wingate, and Streett.Â  Wingate answered and asserted affirmative defenses, including an allegation that Landlord failed to mitigate its damages.Â  The case was referred to a special referee.Â  At the hearing, Robert B. Pace, Landlordâ€™s president and sole shareholder, testified about his attempts to mitigate Landlordâ€™s damages.Â Â Â  \r\nThe special referee found Pace made minimal efforts to mitigate Landlordâ€™s damages.Â  However, he noted Pace did make some effort to lease or sell the property, and the propertyâ€™s character made it one which would be difficult to lease or sell.Â  As a result, the special referee awarded Landlord damages in the amount of $12,000, representing one year of rent payments.Â  In addition, he ordered Wingate to pay the 15% late fee due on this amount and attorneyâ€™s fees totaling $3,000.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action for breach of contract seeking damages is one at law. Â Sterling Dev. Co. v. Collins, 309 S.C. 237, 240, 421 S.E.2d 402, 404&nbsp;(1992).Â  In an\r\naction at law, the appellate court will correct any error of law, but it must affirm the special\r\nrefereeâ€™s factual findings unless no evidence reasonably supports those findings.Â  Roberts v. Gaskins, 327 S.C. 478, 483, 486 S.E.2d 771, 773&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Mitigation\r\nWingate contends no evidence supports the special refereeâ€™s conclusion with respect to the mitigation of damages issue.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA party injured by the acts of another is required to do those things a person of ordinary prudence would do under the circumstances to mitigate damages; however, the law does not require unreasonable exertion or substantial expense for this to be accomplished.â€Â  Genovese v. Bergeron, 327 S.C. 567, 572, 490 S.E.2d 608, 611&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œA failure to attempt to mitigate damages will not bar plaintiff entirely from a recovery, but will only prevent the recovery of such damages as might have been avoided by reasonable efforts on his or her part.â€Â  25 C.J.S. Damages Â§47 (Supp. 2006) (emphasis added).\r\nThe party asserting the defense of mitigation bears the burden of establishing a lack of due diligence in minimizing damages.Â  Perry v. Green, 313 S.C. 250, 255, 437 S.E.2d 150, 153&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1993).Â  Whether a party acted reasonably to mitigate damages is ordinarily a question of fact.Â  Baril v. Aiken Regâ€™l Med. Ctrs., 352 S.C. 271, 285, 573 S.E.2d 830, 838&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002).\r\nIn this case, Pace testified he â€œcontacted everybody [he] could think of [to ask] if they wanted to rent [the property].â€Â  He negotiated with a railroad and a local steel company, both of which decided not to lease the property.Â  During this time, approximately twelve people contacted Pace to inquire about the property.Â  After these efforts failed, Pace contacted a real estate agent and put the property up for sale sometime in 2003.[3]Â  Pace testified the nature of the property deterred potential lessees, specifically the local steel company.Â  In addition, despite the use of a real estate agent after 2003, the property had not been sold or leased at the time of the hearing, in October 2005.Â  \r\nThe special referee found â€œ[p]rior to listing the property for sale with an agent in 2003, [Landlord] made minimal efforts to lease or sell the property.â€Â  He further noted, â€œPace . . . did not try very hard during the lease period to sell or lease the subject property.â€Â  However, the special referee also noted the special nature of the property made it difficult to find a willing lessee or purchaser.Â  Therefore, even if Landlord failed to mitigate damages as a matter of law, evidence supports the special refereeâ€™s conclusion this failure would not entirely bar Landlordâ€™s recovery.\r\nII. Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nWingate maintains the special referee erred in the method with which it awarded attorneyâ€™s fees to Landlord.Â  We find Wingate failed to preserve this issue for our review.\r\nIn the present case, Pace listed the damages Landlord claimed as a result of Tenantâ€™s breach of the lease, including $15,218.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Wingateâ€™s counsel informed the special referee: â€œ[W]ith regard to attorney[â€™]s fees, Iâ€”I guess I would just simply require them to produce an agreement between [Landlord and his attorney], just for the record.â€Â Â Â  Landlordâ€™s counsel produced his written agreement with Landlord and entered it into the record.Â  \r\nIn his November 16, 2005 order, the special referee awarded $3,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The special referee simply noted this amount represented 25% of the rent award.Â  We make no comment on the appropriateness of this award because it is not preserved for our review.Â  Wingate did not raise this issue to the special referee or make a Rule 59, SCRCP, motion to attempt to correct this error.Â  See Grant v. S.C. Coastal Council, 319 S.C. 348, 356, 461 S.E.2d 388, 392&nbsp;(1995) (holding alleged errors in a trial courtâ€™s order must be raised in a Rule 59 motion to be preserved for appellate review).Â  Although the general issue of attorneyâ€™s fees was raised to and ruled upon by the special referee, an objection as to the methods used to calculate the award as it was presented in the order was never raised.Â  Therefore, since the special referee was never presented with this issue, we hold Wingate failed to preserve this issue for our review.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold evidence supports the special refereeâ€™s findings with respect to mitigation of damages.Â  Furthermore, Wingate failed to preserve for appellate\r\nreview his challenge to the special refereeâ€™s method of awarding attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Accordingly, the special refereeâ€™s decision is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Streett later declared bankruptcy.Â  He is not a party to this appeal.\r\n[3] Paceâ€™s efforts to sell the property occurred after the lease term would have expired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-084","title":"Sovereign Group v.

Charping, moved into Penthouse H. Â William P. Charping is the president of an entity partnered with the developer of the Surfmaster Building.Â  \r\nAs early as 1987, certain units in the building began experiencing water leaks.Â  In 1993, the Surfmaster Owners Association, Inc. (the Association), hired a consultant to study the leaks.Â  The study revealed the leaks came from many places, including the patios above each unit.Â  As a result, the consulting firm recommended waterproofing each patio to prevent the leaks.Â  \r\nThe Association also hired water infiltration engineers to study the problem.Â  According to Dave Brannon, a board member for the Association from 1987 to the trial of this case, these engineers concluded waterproofing the patios would only temporarily solve the problem.Â  The engineers told the Association â€œthe external finish of the building was loose.â€ Â Because of this opinion, the Association filed suit against the buildingâ€™s developer for defective design and construction.Â  \r\nIn 1996, the parties settled the lawsuit for an amount between two and four million dollars.Â  To begin fixing the leaks, the Association hired Marshall Clarke, an architect, to oversee and prioritize repairs.Â  In addition, because the settlement money was not enough to complete the repairs, the Association levied a special assessment of $425,000.Â  However, the Association never collected this assessment.[1]Â  During the ensuing years, the Association allowed individual owners to pay for repairs and seek refunds.Â  Clarke oversaw these repairs and approved of the expenditures.\r\nIn 1994, the Charpings vacated Penthouse H.Â  Both Charpings later testified they spent $110,000 to renovate Penthouse H and intended to use it as rental property.Â  After the renovation was completed in the summer of 1996, they discovered leaks from an adjoining stairwell.Â  More leaks came from the drainpipes running from the patio on Penthouse G, the penthouse immediately above Penthouse H.Â  \r\nThe Charpings both testified they could not rent out Penthouse H because of the extensive damage.Â  They also could not repair the leaks because the stairwell and patio were common or limited common areas that only the Association or the owner of Penthouse G could fix.Â  They informed the Association of the leaks in September 1996, but received no response.Â  \r\nBecause the Charpings could not prevail upon the Association to fix the leaks, they stopped paying their assessments, and soon thereafter, the Association filed a lien for unpaid assessments.Â  Approximately one year later, the Charpings visited Penthouse H and found the locks had been changed.Â  When they entered later that day, they discovered the ceiling had fallen, the carpet had been torn up, and certain fixtures had been removed.Â  \r\nThe Charpingsâ€™ attorney, Michael Montgomery, wrote the Association, informing it of the destruction and requesting a new key to Penthouse H.Â  The Association refused to provide a key and filed a foreclosure action against Sovereign.Â  \r\nThe water leaks and destruction inside Penthouse H worsened through 2002.Â  Clarke had given one of the contractors a key to use Penthouse H as a construction staging area.Â  In November 2002, the Charpings hired Charles Lindsey, a specialty contractor, to clean up the mess.Â  Lindsey charged $6,000.Â  \r\nSovereign answered the Associationâ€™s foreclosure action and counterclaimed for negligence and breach of contract.Â  The case was referred to a master-in-equity, who severed the foreclosure action from the counterclaims before the case went to circuit court for trial.Â  \r\nBefore opening arguments, Sovereign made an oral motion to amend its answer and counterclaim to include causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, outrage, and civil conspiracy.Â  The trial judge allowed the breach of fiduciary duty and outrage amendments, but denied the civil conspiracy amendment.Â  \r\nAt trial, Sovereignâ€™s expert in remodeling and construction work testified the cost to restore Penthouse H to its 1996 condition was $104,000.Â  Moreover, Thomas L. Watts, Jr., an appraiser, testified the lost rental value of Penthouse H from January 1997 to December 2004 was $692,000.Â  \r\nThe trial judge granted the Associationâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on Sovereignâ€™s outrage claim and submitted three causes of action to the jury: negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract.Â  The trial judge instructed the jury on damages, without objection from Sovereign. In fact, trial counsel for Sovereign stated that the charge â€œwas perfectly clearâ€ on damages and that he was â€œhappyâ€ with it.Â  The jury returned a verdict for Sovereign on all three causes of action, awarding $104,000 on the negligence claim, $6,000 on the breach of fiduciary duty claim, and $126,000 on the breach of contract claim.Â  In a special interrogatory, the jury found Sovereign had not been comparatively negligent.Â  \r\nSovereign agreed it would need to elect its remedy, and the trial judge gave the parties ten days to make post-trial motions.Â  Sovereign moved for a new trial based on the facts or, in the alternative, for a new trial nisi additur.Â  Specifically, Sovereign argued the jury failed to award damages for lost rental value.Â  The trial judge denied the motions.Â  Sovereign elected to recover based on its breach of contract claim.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. New Trial Motion\r\nSovereign argues the trial judge should have granted its motion for a new trial based on the thirteenth juror doctrine or, in the alternative, a new trial nisi additur.Â  Specifically, Sovereign maintains the trial judge should have granted these motions because the jury was confused about the proper method to allocate damages and the jury did not compensate Sovereign for the lost rental value of Penthouse H.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe thirteenth juror doctrine is a vehicle by which the circuit court may grant a new trial absolute when it finds the evidence does not justify the verdict.Â  Trivelas v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 357 S.C. 545, 553, 593 S.E.2d 504, 508&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  Under this doctrine, the\r\njudge may grant a new trial if the verdict is inconsistent and reflects the juryâ€™s confusion.Â  Sorin Equip. Co., Inc. v. The Firm, Inc., 323 S.C. 359, 363-64, 474 S.E.2d 819, 822&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\nA trial judgeâ€™s order granting or denying a new trial upon the thirteenth juror doctrine will not be\r\ndisturbed unless the decision is wholly unsupported by the evidence, or the conclusion\r\nreached was controlled by an error of law.Â  Vinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 403, 477 S.E.2d 715, 722&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996). â€œTo reverse the denial of a new trial motion under this doctrine we must, in essence, conclude that the moving party was entitled to a directed verdict at trial.â€Â  Haselden v. Davis, 341 S.C. 486, 506, 534 S.E.2d 295, 306&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000); Parker v. Evening Post Pub. Co., 317 S.C. 236, 247, 452 S.E.2d 640, 646&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1994).Â  \r\nThe trial judge also has the authority to grant a new trial nisi additur, which is vehicle by which the plaintiff is granted a new trial unless the defendant agrees to pay an additional amount.Â  Graham v. Whitaker, 282 S.C. 393, 401, 321 S.E.2d 40, 45&nbsp;(1984).Â  On appeal, the trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding a motion for new trial nisi additur will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law.Â  Green v. Fritz, 356 S.C. 566, 570, 590 S.E.2d 39, 41&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\nInitially, we note that to the extent Sovereign attributes any jury confusion to the jury charge, this argument is not preserved for review.Â  Sovereign expressly approved the instruction and lodged no objection to it.Â  Because Sovereign failed to raise any issue regarding the jury instruction to the trial judge, the argument is not preserved for our review.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).\r\nSovereign also argues the verdict itself shows the jury was confused regarding election of remedies.Â  Specifically, Sovereign points out that the $104,000 awarded for the negligence claim corresponds with the amount it would cost to restore Penthouse H to its 1996 condition, the $6,000 awarded for the breach of fiduciary duty claim corresponds to the cost of cleaning up the penthouse after it was used as a construction staging area, and the $126,000 awarded for the breach of contract was intended to reimburse Sovereign for its loss of use.Â  We disagree and find the verdict valid on its face.Â  \r\nDiffering damage awards for each cause of action does not create a necessary implication that the jury mistakenly split the total damages among the three claims; rather, the elements of each claim and the nature of duty breached controls the types of damages that could have resulted therefrom. See Steinke v. S.C. Dept. of Labor, 336 S.C. 373, 387, 520 S.E.2d 142, 149 (1999)(stating plaintiff must show defendantâ€™s breach of duty proximately caused plaintiffâ€™s injury in a negligence case); Fuller v. Eastern Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 240 S.C. 75, 89, 124 S.E.2d 602, 610&nbsp;(1962) (â€œThe general rule is that for a breach of contract the defendant is liable for whatever damages follow as a natural consequence and a proximate result of such breach.â€)(emphasis added);Â  Moore v. Moore, 360 S.C. 241, 253, 599 S.E.2d 467, 473&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004) (â€œDamages in an action for breach of a fiduciary duty are those proximately resulting from the wrongful conduct of the defendant.â€)(emphasis added).\r\nFurthermore, the amount awarded for breach of contract does not correspond with the $692,000 Sovereign claimed it was entitled to for its loss of use.Â  Rather than reflecting Sovereignâ€™s loss of use, the juryâ€™s award of $126,000 for breach of contract might include $104,000 to restore Penthouse H to its 1996 condition, along with the $6,000 to reimburse Sovereign for cleanup costs, and an additional $16,000 in loss of use. While $16,000 for loss of use is significantly less than what Sovereign anticipated, the jury was free to award this lower figure.Â  There is substantial evidence in the record that indicates the Sovereignâ€™s loss of use was nowhere near $692,000.Â  Norman Fortson, a member of the Associationâ€™s board, testified the water damage to Penthouse H was only minor.Â  This testimony supports an inference that the leaks did not prevent Sovereign from using or renting Penthouse H.Â  Thus the jury may have found the only loss of use suffered by Sovereign occurred during the period when the Charpings were refused a key.Â  The jury might have reasonably determined this short-term loss of use amounted to only $16,000.\r\nWhile the jury may have come to some other conclusion, we think the above-cited evidence reasonably supports the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  Accordingly, we hold the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in failing to grant Sovereignâ€™s motion for a new trial on the facts or a new trial nisi additur.\r\nII. Motion to Amend\r\nSovereign argues the trial judge erred in refusing to amend its answer and counterclaims to include a cause of action for civil conspiracy.Â  We disagree.\r\nSovereign made its motion pursuant to Rule 15(a), SCRCP.Â  Rule 15(a) reads, in relevant part, â€œ[A] party may amend his pleading only by leave of court . . . ; and leave shall be given when justice so requires and does not prejudice any other party.â€Â  Therefore, a motion to amend is addressed to the trial judgeâ€™s discretion, and the party opposing the motion has the burden of establishing prejudice.Â  Collins Entmâ€™t, Inc. v. White, 363 S.C. 546, 562, 611 S.E.2d 262, 270&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  The prejudice envisioned by this rule is a lack of notice that the new issue is to be tried and a lack of opportunity to refute it.Â \r\nStanley v.

Morgan, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â  Allen Robinson appeals his conviction for possession of cocaine.Â  He asserts the circuit court judge erred in refusing to suppress the drug evidence that was seized during a search of his vehicle at a driverâ€™s license checkpoint.[1]Â  We reverse.[2]\r\nFACTS\r\nPrior to Robinsonâ€™s trial for possession with intent to distribute cocaine, Robinsonâ€™s counsel moved to suppress the evidence of the cocaine.Â  Specifically, he contended the cocaine was found pursuant to an illegal search and seizure.Â  Based on this motion, the trial judge held a suppression hearing during which Trooper Steven Branham testified regarding the search.Â  \r\nOn July 5, 2002, Trooper Steven Branham was working at a driverâ€™s license checkpoint in Aiken County. Â At approximately 2:30 p.m., Branham observed a vehicle â€œslowing downâ€ and â€œspeeding upâ€ as it approached the checkpoint.Â  While he was watching the vehicle, Branham noticed that Robinson, the driver, and his two passengers were â€œrummagingâ€ and acting â€œfrantic.â€ Â He further testified â€œthey were frantically moving, throwing arms around.â€ Â Branham admitted that he initially observed this behavior at a distance of â€œ[a]nywhere from 75 to 100 yards.â€Â  Based on his experience, Branham believed the occupants of the vehicle were â€œhiding something.â€ Â According to Branham the vehicle stopped just before the checkpoint.Â  As he approached the vehicle, Branham became suspicious because the occupants appeared very nervous.Â  Branham questioned them as to whether they were hiding anything.Â  Branham testified the occupants responded in a â€œnervous toneâ€ that they were â€œnot hiding anything at all.â€Â  \r\nBranham then looked inside the vehicle and saw a brown paper bag containing a can, which he described as â€œa 22 oz. beer can or larger can.â€ Â Although Branham testified that he believed the can contained an alcoholic beverage, he could not immediately tell that it was a beer can or that the can was open. Â The testimony reveals the can was concealed in the paper bag and was pointing away from Branham when he looked in the window of the vehicle.Â  In fact, Branham stated, â€œ[i]t was not in an open situation.Â  A brown bag goes up to the tip of the rim of the can.Â  It wasnâ€™t like an open and look.Â  This is a bag that was molded or formed, you know, like it had been used.â€ Â Branham stated his observation of the can further raised his â€œsuspicionâ€ of the occupants. Â After instructing Robinson to pull over to the side of the road, Branham then ordered the occupants to exit the vehicle.Â  Branham asked Robinson if he was the owner of the vehicle and if there was anything illegal in the vehicle.Â  Robinson acknowledged he owned the vehicle and further responded to the question, â€œI donâ€™t know; there shouldnâ€™t be anything illegal in the car.â€Â Â Â  \r\nAt that point, Branham proceeded to search the vehicle to see â€œif there [were] any other beer cans or other illegal contraband in the vehicle.â€Â  Branham discovered the can in the brown paper bag was in fact an open beer can. Â During the course of his search, Branham found a plastic bag containing 1.22 grams of cocaine located underneath the driverâ€™s seat.Â Â Â  \r\nOn cross-examination, Branham admitted he did not ask Robinson for his consent to search the vehicle. Â Branham further acknowledged that Robinson and his passengers denied ownership of the drugs. Â Branham also did not issue a ticket for an open container violation.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAt the conclusion of Branhamâ€™s testimony, the judge heard arguments from counsel regarding the motion to suppress. Â Although Robinsonâ€™s counsel did not challenge the legitimacy of the license checkpoint, he asserted Robinsonâ€™s and his passengersâ€™ behavior at the checkpoint did not â€œrise to the level of probable cause or even reasonable suspicion that criminal activityâ€ was happening.Â  Additionally, counsel argued Branhamâ€™s testimony did not give rise to the automobile exception to the warrant requirement. Â He contended Branham could not have seen the beer can as an open container because it was not in plain view, but instead, was facing away from him when he looked through the window of the vehicle.Â  Because Robinson did not receive a ticket for the open container violation, counsel pointed out that the search could not be considered incident to arrest. \r\nIn response, the solicitor argued that Branham, under the totality of the circumstances, had probable cause to search the vehicle based on the following:Â  (1) Robinson approached the checkpoint in a suspicious manner; (2) the occupants of the vehicle were frantically moving around as if they were hiding something; (3) Robinson stopped the vehicle several yards before the checkpoint; (4) the occupants of the vehicle gave nervous, vague answers to Branham when he questioned them; and (5) the twenty-two ounce can wrapped in a brown paper bag appeared to be an open beer container.Â Â Â  \r\nIn reply, Robinsonâ€™s counsel stated the nervous behavior of the occupants of the vehicle might have been sufficient for Branham to ask them to exit the vehicle and conduct a Terry pat-down for weapons.Â  However, she asserted it was not sufficient to conduct a search of the vehicle.Â  Furthermore, counsel contended the existence of a beer can in the back seat of the vehicle did not give rise to probable cause because Branham could not tell by â€œplain viewâ€ that the can was open.Â  \r\nAfter hearing arguments from counsel, the trial judge ultimately denied Robinsonâ€™s motion to suppress.Â  The judge found Branham had probable cause to conduct the search based on the following:Â  (1) Robinson and his passengers appeared to be reaching downward as they approached the checkpoint; (2) Robinson drove slowly up to the checkpoint and stopped some distance before the checkpoint; and (3) the open container in the back seat of the vehicle.\r\nThe trial proceeded with Branham recounting the incident in the presence of the jury.Â  Robinson, the defenseâ€™s only witness, then testified.Â  Robinson testified that at the time of the incident he was driving back from Augusta with his brother and his brotherâ€™s friend after picking up fish for a family reunion on the July 4th weekend.Â  He explained that as he approached the checkpoint he slowed down in order to allow his brother time to fasten his seatbelt. Â When Branham found the cocaine, Robinson denied that it belonged to him.Â  He further testified that he did not know anything about the cocaine.Â  Additionally, Robinson claimed he had no idea there was an open beer can in his car at the time he was stopped at the checkpoint.Â Â  \r\nThe jury convicted Robinson of the lesser-included offense of possession of cocaine.Â  The judge sentenced Robinson to eighteen months imprisonment suspended on eight months probation.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nRobinson argues the circuit court judge erred in denying his motion to suppress.Â  He contends there was insufficient probable cause for Branham to believe a crime was being committed.Â  In support of this contention, Robinson asserts â€œ[t]he beer can was contained in a paper bag and its nature was not immediately apparent to [Branham].Â  Furthermore, [Branham] admitted that he did not normally ticket for a violation of the â€˜open containerâ€™ law.â€Â  Additionally, Robinson relies on Branhamâ€™s testimony that â€œhe uses the â€˜open containerâ€™ law as a tool to â€˜go further into something.â€™â€Â  As will be more fully discussed, we agree with Robinson.\r\nThe Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees â€œ[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.â€Â  U.S. Const. amend. IV. Evidence obtained as a result of an unlawful search constitutes a violation of the Fourth Amendment and is inadmissible at trial. State v. Nelson, 336 S.C. 186, 192 n.3, 519 S.E.2d 786, 789 n.3 (1999).Â  â€œThe admission of such evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial judge whose ruling will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â \r\nState v. Brannon, 347 S.C. 85, 89, 552 S.E.2d 773, 775 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nâ€œOn appeal from a suppression hearing, this court is bound by the circuit courtâ€™s factual findings if any evidence supports the findings.â€ State v. Abdullah, 357 S.C. 344, 349, 592 S.E.2d 344, 347 (Ct. App. 2004). Â â€œIn an appeal from a motion to suppress evidence based on Fourth Amendment grounds,\r\nan appellate court may conduct its own review of the record to determine whether the evidence supports the circuit courtâ€™s decision.â€Â  Id. at 349-50, 592 S.E.2d at 347.\r\nâ€œGenerally, a warrantless search is per se unreasonable and thus violative of the Fourth Amendmentâ€™s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures.â€ State v. Bultron, 318 S.C. 323, 331, 457 S.E.2d 616, 621 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  â€œHowever, a warrantless search will withstand constitutional scrutiny where the search falls within one of a few specifically established and well delineated exceptions to the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule.â€ Id. at 331-32, 457 S.E.2d at 621.Â  These exceptions include: Â (1) search incident to a lawful arrest; (2) â€œhot pursuit;â€ (3) stop and frisk; (4) automobile exception; (5) â€œplain viewâ€ doctrine; (6) consent; and (7) abandonment. State v. Dupree, 319 S.C. 454, 456-57, 462 S.E.2d 279, 281 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1131 (1996).Â  â€œThe burden of establishing probable cause as well as the existence of circumstances constituting an exception to the general prohibition against warrantless searches and seizures is upon the prosecution.â€ Bultron, 318 S.C. at 332, 457 S.E.2d at 621.Â \r\n\r\nâ€œThe two bases for the [automobile] exception are:Â  (1) the ready mobility of automobiles and the potential that evidence may be lost before a warrant is obtained; and (2) the lessened expectation of privacy in motor vehicles which are subject to government regulation.â€ State v. Cox, 290 S.C. 489, 491, 351 S.E.2d 570, 571 (1986).Â  â€œ[U]nder the automobile exception, probable cause alone is sufficient to justify a warrantless search.â€Â \r\nId. at 492, 351 S.E.2d at 571-72.\r\nâ€œThe standard for probable cause to conduct a warrantless search is the same as that for a search with a warrant.â€Â  Bultron, 318 S.C. at 332, 457 S.E.2d at 621.Â  This requires, â€œa justifiable determination, based upon the totality of the circumstances and in view of all the evidence available to law enforcement officials at the time of the search, that there exists a practical, nontechnical probability that a crime is being committed or has been committed and incriminating evidence is involved.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œ[U]nder the automobile exception, if probable cause exists to justify the warrantless search of a lawfully stopped vehicle, it justifies the search of every part of the vehicle and its content that may conceal the object of the search.â€Â  Id. at 332, 457 S.E.2d at 621.\r\nIn analyzing the Fourth Amendment implications of a routine traffic stop, this court has explained:\r\n\r\nA routine stop constitutes a Fourth Amendment seizure so that when the purpose justifying the stop is exceeded, the detention becomes illegal unless a reasonable suspicion of some other crime exists.Â  United States v. Sullivan, 138 F.3d 126 (4th Cir. 1998); see State v. Robinson, 306 S.C. 399, 402, 412 S.E.2d 411, 413 (1991)(â€œTo justify a brief stop [or] detention, the police officer must have a reasonable suspicion that the person has been involved in criminal activity.â€). Â The term â€œreasonable suspicionâ€ requires a particularized and objective basis that would lead one to suspect another of criminal activity.Â \r\nUnited States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed. 621 (1981); State v. Woodruff, 344 S.C. 537, 544 S.E.2d 290 (Ct. App. 2001). Â In determining whether reasonable suspicion exists, the whole picture must be considered. United States v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989). Â The burden is on the State to articulate facts sufficient to support reasonable suspicion. State v. Butler, 343 S.C. 198, 539 S.E.2d 414 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nState v. Pichardo, 367 S.C. 84, 104, 623 S.E.2d 840, 851 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\nInitially, we note that Robinson does not challenge the legality of the driverâ€™s license checkpoint.Â  Therefore, our analysis is confined to a determination of whether the circuit court judgeâ€™s denial of Robinsonâ€™s motion to suppress based on Branhamâ€™s actions at the checkpoint was supported by any evidence.Â  Although we are cognizant of this limited standard of review, we find there is no evidence to support the judgeâ€™s decision.\r\nBased upon the totality of the circumstances and in view of all the evidence available to Branham at the time of the search, we believe the warrantless search was not justified.Â  We find the State failed to meet its burden to articulate facts sufficient to support a reasonable suspicion that Robinson was involved in criminal activity.\r\nIn analyzing this issue, we review the facts submitted by the State during the suppression hearing. Â Essentially, Branham reached his decision to search Robinsonâ€™s vehicle based on the following observations:Â  1). the â€œsuspiciousâ€ behavior of Robinson and his passengers as they approached the checkpoint; 2). the â€œnervousâ€ behavior of Robinson and his passengers once the vehicle stopped at the checkpoint; and 3). the presence of a large can wrapped in a paper bag in Robinsonâ€™s vehicle.Â  Specifically, Branham described Robinsonâ€™s and his passengersâ€™ behavior as they approached the checkpoint as â€œfrantically moving, throwing [their] arms around.â€Â  He found â€œ[t]his was a very suspicious stopping, starting, frantic people inside; very nervous acting people.â€Â  At the checkpoint, Branham claimed the occupants of the vehicle appeared very nervous as if they were hiding something. Â In addition to this behavior, Branham stated his decision to conduct the search was based on his observation of what he believed was a twenty-two ounce can of beer wrapped in a paper bag in the backseat of the vehicle. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nUnder these circumstances, we believe Branham lacked a particularized and objective basis which would have lead him to suspect Robinson of criminal activity.Â  In terms of the â€œsuspiciousâ€ behavior of Robinson and his passengers, it is significant to note that Branham admitted that he initially observed this behavior at a distance of â€œ[a]nywhere from 75 to 100 yards.â€Â  Furthermore, even if Robinson and his passengers exhibited nervous behavior at the checkpoint, these actions were not necessarily indicative of criminal behavior.Â  See Taylor v. Commonwealth, 369 S.E.2d 423, 425 (Va. Ct. App. 1988)(â€œAlthough in some contexts nervous behavior may be relevant, the mere observation that a traveler is nervous is not indicative of criminal behavior.â€ (citing United States v. Gooding, 695 F.2d 78, 84 (4th Cir. 1982))).Â  It is also interesting that despite the purpose of the license checkpoint, Branham did not immediately ask Robinson for his license, registration, and proof of insurance.Â  Instead, he questioned the occupants as to whether they were hiding something and then visually searched the interior of the vehicle.Â  Although Branham testified that he believed the can which he saw to be an alcoholic beverage, he could not immediately tell that the can was open.[3]Â  The testimony reveals the can was concealed in the paper bag and was pointing away from Branham when he looked in the window of the vehicle.Â  In fact, Branham stated, â€œ[i]t was not in an open situation.Â  A brown bag goes up to the tip of the rim of the can.Â  It wasnâ€™t like an open and look.Â  This is a bag that was molded or formed, you know, like it had been used.â€ From this testimony, it is clear that whether or not the can was an open container of alcohol was not immediately apparent to Branham.Â  See State v. Beckham, 334 S.C. 302, 317, 513 S.E.2d 606, 613 (1999) (stating the plain view exception to the search warrant requirement requires that: Â (1) the initial intrusion which afforded the authorities the plain view was lawful; (2) the discovery of the evidence was inadvertent; and (3) the incriminating nature of the evidence was\r\nimmediately apparent to the seizing authorities)(emphasis added). Branham also admitted that he did not normally issue a citation for a violation of the open container law.[4]Â  Rather, he testified that he uses the open container law as a tool â€œto go further into something.â€\r\nTaken together, these circumstances indicate that Branhamâ€™s decision to search was not based on a reasonable suspicion, but rather, a mere hunch of the likelihood of criminal activity.Â  See United States v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266, 274 (2002)(â€œAlthough an officerâ€™s reliance on a mere â€˜hunchâ€™ is insufficient to justify a stop, the likelihood of criminal activity need not rise to the level required for probable cause, and it falls considerably short of satisfying a preponderance of the evidence standard.â€) (citations omitted). Â Because Branham was not justified in extending the purpose of the license checkpoint into a warrantless search of Robinsonâ€™s vehicle, we hold the trial judge erred in failing to suppress the cocaine found as result of the illegal search.\r\nFurthermore, we reject any contention that Robinson waived his right to challenge this issue on appeal when he testified, in response to Branhamâ€™s questions, that he told Branham â€œit was okayâ€ to check the vehicle. Â Robinson gave this testimony after the suppression hearing during which Branham admitted that he did not ask Robinson for his consent to search.Â  As a result, the trial judge did not use the testimony as a basis for his decision. Â Robinsonâ€™s counsel also continued to object to the admission of the evidence during the trial.Â  \r\nOur decision should in no way be construed as limiting the authority of officers to search a vehicle stopped as part of a checkpoint or other traffic stop.Â  We emphasize that if Trooper Branham had testified that he observed in plain view an open container of alcohol in Robinsonâ€™s vehicle, he would have been justified in conducting a search of the vehicle.Â  Cf. State v. Morris, 312 S.C. 116, 118, 439 S.E.2d 291, 292 (Ct. App. 1993) (stating open beer Â container observed in plain view by officer at a traffic stop gave officer probable cause to arrest defendant and conduct inventory search of the vehicle which revealed crack cocaine).Â  Under the specific facts of this case, we hold the search of Robinsonâ€™s vehicle constituted a Fourth Amendment violation and, thus, the trial judge erred in denying Robinsonâ€™s motion to suppress.\r\nAccordingly, Robinsonâ€™s conviction and sentence are\r\n REVERSED.\r\nBEATTY, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Robinsonâ€™s appellate counsel initially filed a brief pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967).Â  After conducting the requisite Anders review, this court ordered re-briefing on the suppression issue.Â  This issue is now our sole appellate consideration.\r\n[2] Â Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3]&nbsp; Section 61-4-110 of the South Carolina Code prohibits a person from having an open container of alcohol in his motor vehicle.Â  This section provides:Â Â  \r\n\r\nIt is unlawful for a person to have in his possession, except in the trunk or luggage compartment, beer or wine in an open container in a motor vehicle of any kind while located upon the public highways or highway rights of way of this State. Â This section must not be construed to prohibit the transporting of beer or wine in a closed container, and this section does not apply to vehicles parked in legal parking places during functions such as sporting events where law enforcement officers are on duty to perform traffic control duties. Â A person who violates the provisions of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than one hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than thirty days.\r\n\r\n For purposes of this section, beer or wine means any beer or wine containing one-half of one percent or more of alcohol by volume.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 61-4-110 (Supp. 2006).\r\n[4] Â We note that Branhamâ€™s decision not to issue a citation for an open container violation is inconsequential to our analysis.Â  See State v. Freiburger, 366 S.C. 125, 133, 620 S.E.2d 737, 741 (2005), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 2287 (2006) (holding fact that officer did not arrest defendant for offense which precipitated his seizure and search did â€œnot vitiate the reasonableness of the underlying searchâ€).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-086","title":"State v.

Michael Spivey, of Mauldin, for Appellant.\r\nCynthia Buck Brown, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Patricia P. Featherston appeals the order of the trial court granting John Staarmanâ€™s motion to dismiss, finding Staarman was an agent of Bredman Group, Inc.[1] and not personally liable to her.Â  We affirm.[2]  \r\nFACTS\r\nStaarmanâ€™s father-in-law owned Bredman Group, of which Staarman was the president in 1999.Â  On June 7, 1999, Featherston entered into a contract with Bredman Group for the construction of her home.Â  Staarman met with Featherston about the construction and signed the contract as president of Bredman Group.Â  Staarman handled all contacts with Featherston; he also designed the garage and was in charge of building the house.\r\nOn December 29, 1999, before completion of Featherstonâ€™s house, Bredman Group filed for bankruptcy pursuant to Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act and closed its business.Â  Featherston then contracted with a new company to complete her house.Â  Featherston subsequently complained that the house had structural defects and was in danger of collapse resulting from settlement and cracking.Â  \r\nOn January 5, 2005, Featherston filed a complaint against Staarman and Bredman Group, alleging breach of contract and breach of warranty.Â  Staarman moved, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, to dismiss Featherstonâ€™s complaint for failure to state a claim.Â  Featherston then filed an amended complaint which included the same allegations as the original complaint.Â  Following Staarmanâ€™s amended motion to dismiss, the trial court issued a form order granting Staarmanâ€™s motion to dismiss.Â  Featherston moved to reconsider the order, arguing Staarman was a necessary defendant in the action.Â  The trial court denied Featherstonâ€™s motion to reconsider.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œA Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action must be resolved by the trial court based solely on the allegations established in the complaint.â€Â  Berry v. McLeod, 328 S.C. 435, 441, 492 S.E.2d 794, 797 (Ct. App. 1997).Â Â  However, â€œif on a motion under 12(b)(6) matters outside the pleadings are presented and not excluded, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment.â€Â  McDonnell v. Consol. Dist. of Aiken, 315 S.C. 487, 489 n.2, 445 S.E.2d 638, 639 n.2 (1994); see Berry, 328 S.C. at 441, 492 S.E.2d at 798 (finding where the trial court decided a Rule 12(b)(6) motion based on matters outside the pleadings, the trial court converted the motion to dismiss into a summary judgment motion pursuant to Rule 56, SCRCP).\r\nHere, in deciding Staarmanâ€™s motion to dismiss, the trial court considered matters outside the pleadings.Â  As stated in the trial courtâ€™s order: â€œafter hearing arguments and considering all documents submitted, including the Complaint and Counselâ€™s briefs, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim against Defendant John Staarman and he should be dismissed from this case.â€Â  Because the trial court considered matters outside the pleadings, pursuant to McDonnell and Berry, the trial court necessarily converted the motion to dismiss into a summary judgment motion. \r\nWhen granting summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56, SCRCP, an appellate court applies the same standard of review utilized by the trial court.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  A trial courtâ€™s decision to grant a motion for summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue of material fact so that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Id.Â  All ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed against the movant.Â  Gilbert v. Miller, 356 S.C. 25, 28, 586 S.E.2d 861, 863 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFeatherston contends the trial court erred in granting Staarmanâ€™s motion to dismiss.Â  Featherston specifically contends that because Staarman was the person in charge of construction of her house, and she had all discussions with him regarding the construction, Staarman was responsible for the defective construction and should not have been dismissed from this case.Â  We disagree.\r\nThis court has recognized the general principle that an agent is not liable to be sued upon contracts made by him on behalf of his principal if the name of his principal is disclosed and made known to the person contracted with at the time of entering into the contract.Â  Thomas v. Delta Enterprises, Inc., 302 S.C. 351, 352, 396 S.E.2d 122, 123 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  The liability, if any, is that of the principal alone.Â  Skinner &amp; Ruddock, Inc. v. London Guarantee &amp; Acc. Co., 239 S.C. 614, 619, 124 S.E.2d 178, 180 (1962).Â  An agent contracting with the authority of his principal binds him to the same extent as if the principal personally made the contract.Â  S.C. Ins. Co. v. James C. Greene and Co., 290 S.C. 171, 183, 348 S.E.2d 617, 624 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  Thus, the principal is liable vice the agent by reason of his consent to be bound.Â  Id.Â  The agent becomes personally liable only when the principal is not known, where there is no responsible principal, or where the agent becomes liable by acting outside of his authority.Â  Skinner, 239 S.C. at 619, 124 S.E.2d at 180.\r\nIn this case, the evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s finding that Staarman was an agent of Bredman Group at the time it contracted with Featherston for the construction of her house.Â  There is no dispute that the contract states the agreement was made between â€œThe Bredman Group, Inc., the contractor, and Patricia P. Featherston, the buyer.â€Â  Although Featherston met with Staarman to enter into the contract, and Staarman was the president of Bredman Group at the time he signed the contract for the corporation, Staarman, as an agent, is not personally liable for the act of his principal.Â  Lawlor v. Scheper, 232 S.C. 94, 98, 101 S.E. 2d 269, 271 (1957).\r\nMoreover, even assuming Featherston is correct that Staarman was the only person to supervise construction of her house, and he was on the construction site each day and had all discussions with her, Staarman acted under his authority, whether implied or apparent, as an agent of Bredman Group.Â  Because Staarman disclosed his principal to Featherston in the contract, Staarman demonstrated his intentions to bind his principal to the contract.Â  Moreover, the record reflects that payments were made by Featherston to the corporation.Â  Further, Featherston filed a claim in The Bredman Groupâ€™s bankruptcy proceeding stating the corporation owed her $31,971.75.Â  Under Thomas and Lawlor, such disclosure precluded Staarman from liability.Â  Therefore, the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Staarman. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the trial court did not err in grantingÂ  summary judgment in favor of Staarman.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, BEATTY, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Bredman Group, Inc. is not a party to this appeal. \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-088","title":"McMillan v.

Umstead, of Myrtle Beach; for Appellant.\r\nHenrietta U. Golding and Amanda Bailey, of Myrtle Beach; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Joseph J. McMillan, Jr., appeals two circuit court orders, arguing:Â  1). the first circuit court judge erred in denying his motion for a preliminary injunction; and 2) the second circuit court judge erred in denying his motion to join an additional defendant to his cause of action against BCG Properties, LLC. Â We affirm in part and dismiss in part.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn December 20, 1996, Joseph J. McMillan, Jr., entered into a commercial property lease agreement with JC &amp; S Investments (JC &amp; S) for the lease of retail space where he planned to conduct his real estate business.Â  John Clarke, the owner of the property, and Marshall Stewart, III, both JC &amp; S partners, signed as the lessor.Â  Pursuant to the lease, the parties agreed that McMillan would lease a unit of retail space within a new shopping strip located on First and Second Avenue and facing Ocean Boulevard in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Â The lease was to run â€œfor a term of 5 years plus 10 additional 1 year periods at the option of Tenant, beginning on completion of interior walls and bathrooms, and ending 5 years plus 10 additional 1 year terms (options at the will of the Tenant) later.â€Â  Therefore, McMillanâ€™s tenancy would expire no later than June 10, 2012, if he decided to exercise the options as provided in the lease.Â  \r\nIn December 2003, Clarke met with Henry Lewis, a certified public accountant with authority to negotiate for BCG Properties, LLC (BCG), to contract for the sale of the shopping strip.Â  BCG intended to purchase the property for the purpose of developing a condominium resort.Â  In contemplation of purchasing the property, BCG met with the two business tenants of the shopping strip, one being McMillan.Â  BCG bought out the remaining lease of the other tenant and entered into negotiations with McMillan regarding the buyout of his lease.Â  The parties dispute whether an agreement was reached regarding the buyout.Â  BCG contends the parties agreed upon a $150,000 purchase price.Â  McMillan, however, claims the parties did not reach a final agreement. \r\nOn January 9, 2004, JC &amp; S sold to BCG the shopping strip, subject to McMillanâ€™s lease.Â  After the closing, McMillan declined to terminate the lease and continued to occupy the retail space.Â  As a result of McMillanâ€™s continued occupation of the property, BCG was unable to proceed with the approximately ninety-eight million dollar project which required the demolition of the shopping strip and metal building.\r\nOn April 28, 2005, McMillan filed suit against BCG alleging that BCG intended to turn off his utilities and demolish the property.Â  In his Complaint, McMillan sought a Temporary Restraining Order, a Preliminary Injunction, and a Permanent Injunction in order to ensure that BCG did not interfere with his quiet enjoyment of the property.Â  In its Answer, BCG denied the allegations and counterclaimed for negligent misrepresentation, promissory estoppel, and requested an injunction based on McMillanâ€™s promise to terminate his lease and not delay the construction project.\r\nOn the same date that McMillan filed his Complaint, he moved for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO).Â  In an ex parte hearing, Circuit Court Judge Paula Thomas granted McMillanâ€™s motion and scheduled a hearing for May 3, 2005.Â  At the conclusion of the May 3rd hearing, Judge Thomas continued the TRO through May 16, 2005, and took the motion under advisement.Â  By order dated May 26, 2005, Judge Thomas denied McMillanâ€™s motion for a preliminary injunction and continued the TRO until forty-five days after BCG provided written notice to McMillanâ€™s counsel for the location of proposed rental spaces.Â  In reaching this decision Judge Thomas found McMillan â€œhas an adequate remedy at law for this matter can be resolved by money.â€Â  Therefore, Judge Thomas declined to â€œinterpose the drastic remedy of injunctive relief where the parties have an adequate remedy at law.â€ Â Pursuant to this order, BCG proposed alternative rental spaces to McMillan by letters dated May 27, 2005, and June 6, 2005.Â  McMillan rejected each of these proposals.\r\nOn June 6, 2005, McMillan filed a motion for reconsideration of Judge Thomasâ€™s May 26, 2005 order.Â  In this motion, McMillan asserted Judge Thomas erred in denying his motion for a preliminary injunction.Â  In his memorandum in support of his motion, McMillan claimed there was likelihood of success on the merits and the denial of a preliminary injunction would result in irreparable harm for which there was no adequate remedy at law. Â When McMillan did not receive a hearing on his motion for reconsideration, McMillanâ€™s counsel wrote a letter to Judge Thomas inquiring about her decision.Â  In response, Judge Thomas gave the parties until July 6, 2005, to brief any issues related to the motion.Â  \r\nBy order dated July 13, 2005, Judge Thomas dissolved the TRO and denied McMillanâ€™s motion for reconsideration.Â  On August 12, 2005, McMillan appealed to this court from Judge Thomasâ€™s order.[2]Â  \r\nSubsequent to the July 13th order, BCG wrote McMillan a letter on July 14, 2005, in which it stated that the building demolition would commence on July 25, 2005.Â  In response, McMillanâ€™s counsel sent BCG a letter stating that the denial of the TRO and preliminary injunction did not entitle BCG to evict McMillan without due process as provided in the Landlord/Tenant Act.Â  During this period of correspondence between the parties, McMillan purchased the metal building connected with the shopping strip as well as related air conditioning units.\r\nBased on his purchase of the building and the provisions of the Landlord/Tenant Act, McMillan moved for another TRO on July 25, 2005.Â  On August 16, 2005, Judge Thomas held a hearing on the motion and issued a form order providing that McMillan had until September 27, 2005, to vacate the building or remove the building. Â McMillan appealed Judge Thomasâ€™s order to this court on September 6, 2005.[3]  \r\nSimultaneously with his appeal to this court, McMillan filed a motion to amend his original Complaint to join Harvey Graham and John Clarke individually as defendants, and to allege a cause of action for specific performance.Â  After a hearing on September 14, 2005, Circuit Court Judge James Lockemy granted McMillanâ€™s motion to add Harvey Graham as a defendant and amend the Complaint to include a cause of action for specific performance.Â  Judge Lockemy denied McMillanâ€™s motion to add Clarke as a defendant.Â  \r\nMcMillan appealed Judge Lockemyâ€™s order to this court on October 11, 2005.Â  This court consolidated McMillanâ€™s appeal of Judge Thomasâ€™s two orders dated July 13, 2005, and August 16, 2005, with his appeal of Judge Lockemyâ€™s order dated September 14, 2005. \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nMcMillan argues Judge Thomas erred in denying his motion for a preliminary injunction.Â  Specifically, he contends he had â€œa valid, enforceable long-term lease and met the test for issuance of a preliminary injunction.â€Â  For reasons that will be discussed, we find McMillanâ€™s argument is moot.\r\nâ€œGenerally, this Court only considers cases presenting a justiciable controversy.â€ Â Sloan v. Friends of Hunley, Inc., 369 S.C. 20, 25, 630 S.E.2d 474, 477 (2006).Â  â€œA justiciable controversy exists when there is a real and substantial controversy which is appropriate for judicial determination, as distinguished from a dispute that is contingent, hypothetical, or abstract.â€ Id.\r\nâ€œA moot case exists where a judgment rendered by the court will have no practical legal effect upon an existing controversy because an intervening event renders any grant of effectual relief impossible for the reviewing court. If there is no actual controversy, this Court will not decide\r\nmoot or academic questions.â€ Â Seabrook v. Knox, 369 S.C. 191, ___, 631 S.E.2d 907, 910 (2006)(citations omitted); see Collins Music Co. v. IGT, 365 S.C. 544, 549, 619 S.E.2d 1, 3 (Ct. App. 2005), cert. denied (Dec. 7, 2006)(noting a matter becomes moot when some event occurs making it impossible to grant effectual relief).\r\nHere, McMillan sought a preliminary injunction to restrain BCG from demolishing the building, turning off the utilities, and otherwise interfering with his quiet enjoyment of the property.Â  The parties, however, both state in their briefs that the leased premises at issue in this appeal have been demolished.Â  Thus, even if we were to find Judge Thomas erred in denying McMillanâ€™s motion, it would have no practical effect on this controversy.Â  Because a decision on this issue would not grant McMillan any effectual relief, we hold the issue is moot.\r\nFurthermore, after reviewing the case, we do not believe any exceptions to the mootness doctrine are applicable.Â  See Collins Music Co., 365 S.C. at 549, 619 S.E.2d at 3 (â€œIn civil cases, there are three exceptions to the\r\nmootness doctrine: Â (1) an appellate court can retain jurisdiction if the issue is capable of repetition yet evading review, (2) an appellate court can decide cases of urgency to establish a rule for future conduct in matters of important public interest, and (3) if the decision by the trial court can affect future events or have collateral consequences to the parties, the appellate court can take jurisdiction.â€).Â  Accordingly, we dismiss this portion of the appeal as moot.\r\nII.\r\nMcMillan asserts Judge Lockemy erred in denying his motion to join John Clarke, partner in the original landlord company JC &amp; S Investments, as a defendant.Â  Because McMillanâ€™s lawsuit alleges causes of action for breach of contract (specific performance/damages), violation of the Unfair Trade Practices Act, and negligence, he contends that Clarke should be a party to the action given â€œClarkeâ€™s assignment of the Lease to [BCG] does not relieve Clarke of his Landlord obligations under the lease.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nBecause McMillan fails to cite any authority for this proposition and makes only a conclusory argument, we believe McMillan has abandoned this issue on appeal. See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (noting where a party fails to cite authority or where the argument is simply a conclusory statement, the party is deemed to have abandoned the issue); Mulherin-Howell v. Cobb, 362 S.C. 588, 600, 608 S.E.2d 587, 593-94 (Ct. App. 2005) (noting when an appellant fails to cite any supporting authority for his position and makes conclusory argument, the appellant abandons the issue on appeal).Â  However, even if properly argued, we find the issue is without merit.\r\nRule 19(a) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure â€œallows a court to join, whenever possible, persons materially interested in an action so that a complete determination may be made.â€Â  Gillman v. City of Beaufort, 368 S.C. 24, 26, 627 S.E.2d 746, 747 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  This rule provides:\r\n\r\n(a) Persons to Be Joined if Feasible. A person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action shall be joined as a party in the action if (1) in his absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or (2) he claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in his absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of his claimed interest. If he has not been so joined, the court shall order that he be made a party. If he should join as a plaintiff but refuses to do so, he may be made a defendant, or, in a proper case, an involuntary plaintiff.\r\n\r\nRule 19(a), SCRCP.\r\nHere, McMillan sought to add Clarke as a defendant on the ground that he was the original lessor of the leased premises.Â  Clarke, however, as a partner in JC &amp; S, sold the property to BCG on January 9, 2004, subject to McMillanâ€™s lease.Â  Given Clarkeâ€™s sale of the property and assignment of the lease to BCG, Clarke was no longer in privity of contract.Â  Therefore, McMillan could not maintain a cause of action against him.Â  See Windsor Green Owners Assâ€™n, 362 S.C. 12, 17, 605 S.E.2d 750, 752 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œâ€˜Generally, one not in privity of contract with another cannot maintain an action against him in breach of contract, and any damage resulting from the breach of contract between the defendant and a third party is not, as such, recoverable by the plaintiff.â€™â€ (quoting Bob Hammond Constr. Co. v. Banks Constr. Co., 312 S.C. 422, 424, 440 S.E.2d 890, 891 (Ct. App. 1994))); Welling v. Crosland, 129 S.C. 127, 138, 123 S.E. 776, 780 (1924) (â€œIn other words, by the very act of assignment of such a contract and its acceptance by the assignee, the privity in estate created between the landlord and the original lessee by the lease passes out of the original lessee into the assignee, for the reason that thereby a right in or to the land itself passes.â€)(citations omitted).\r\nAccordingly, we hold Judge Lockemy did not abuse his discretion in denying McMillanâ€™s motion to amend his Complaint to add Clarke as a defendant.Â  See Stanley v. Kirkpatrick, 357 S.C. 169, 174, 592 S.E.2d 296, 298 (2004) (â€œIt is well established that a motion to amend is addressed to the discretion of the trial judge, and the party opposing the motion has the burden of establishing prejudice.â€).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we hold McMillanâ€™s appeal from Judge Thomasâ€™s denial of his motion for a preliminary injunction is moot and, thus, we dismiss this portion of the appeal.Â  We find Judge Lockemy did not abuse his discretion in denying McMillanâ€™s motion to add Clarke as a defendant.Â  Therefore, we affirm his order.Â  We emphasize that our decision in this appeal in no way affects the merits of McMillanâ€™s underlying action.\r\n AFFIRMED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART.\r\nHUFF, BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] Â Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  This court denied BCGâ€™s motion to dismiss McMillanâ€™s appeal as moot by order dated October 13, 2005. \r\n[3] Â On September 16, 2005, McMillan filed a petition for supersedeas and stay with the trial court and this court in which he sought to stay Judge Thomasâ€™s orders dated July 13, 2005, and August 16, 2005, pending his appeal.Â  The trial court and this court denied McMillanâ€™s petition.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-089","title":"Mattox v.

Mirshak and Joan E. Smith, both of Augusta, Georgia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Bobby Allen Mattox (Husband) filed this family court action against Julie Almond Mattox (Wife) seeking, inter alia, custody, equitable distribution, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Wife appeals.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThe parties were married in 1986 and had two daughters, Mariah and Bailey.Â  At the time of trial, the children were 13 and 9 years of age. Â The family lived in the marital home in Edgefield County, South Carolina.Â  \r\nHusband is employed in mechanical work at a company in Augusta, Georgia, where he has worked for over eight years. Â Wife worked in the early part of the marriage and was a stay-at-home mother between 1996 and 2000. Â In 2000, Wife began employment as a waitress several nights a week and as a part-time secretary during the day. Â While the action was pending, Wifeâ€™s attorney hired her in his law practice.Â  Wife has since become employed by the State of Georgia earning approximately $2,200 per month.Â  Husband earns $4,058 per month. Â \r\nWife testified she became depressed about the marriage in 2003.Â  She started a pattern of self-abuse such as hitting herself and blackening her eyes.Â  The children were sometimes in the house while the wife entered the bathroom to hit herself.Â  In February 2004, Wife held a loaded gun to her head in Husbandâ€™s presence and threatened to kill herself.Â  In March of 2004, Wife met Mike Lipscome, a police officer.Â  During the next few months, Wife placed over one hundred telephone calls to Lipscome.Â  \r\nThe children spent a good portion of the summer of 2004 at their grandparentsâ€™ houses.Â  One day in July of 2004, the parties argued during the day and that night after Wife returned from work.Â  Husband called the police and the police found evidence of Wifeâ€™s drug use. Â Wife left the residence. Â The paternal grandmother arrived to take the children.Â  Wife arrived shortly thereafter and, in the grandmother and husbandâ€™s presence, stripped naked, laid down on the floor, and yelled at the husband.Â  The parties separated.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â \r\nRutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  Nor must we ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981).Â  \r\n\r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nCustody\r\nWife argues the family court erred in granting Husbandâ€™s request for custody.Â  We disagree.Â  The â€œprimary, paramount and controllingâ€ factor in all child custody controversies is the best interests of the children.Â \r\nDavis v. Davis, 356 S.C. 132, 135, 588 S.E.2d 102, 103 (2003).Â  The family court should consider how the custody decision will impact all areas of a childâ€™s life and include an assessment of the parentsâ€™ character, fitness, and attitude as they impact the child.Â  Shirley v. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324, 330, 536 S.E.2d 427, 430 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Custody decisions are left to the sound discretion of the family court.Â  Id.\r\nWife argues she is entitled to custody because she was active in the childrenâ€™s lives including teaching Sunday school, coaching cheerleading, and volunteering at the schools.Â  She relies on the numerous witnesses she called to testify to her fitness, arguing Husband called only a few witnesses although both parties â€œhad equal access to members of the community concerning the welfare of the children . . . .â€ Â She also argues her continued drug use did not have an impact on her abilities as a mother and Husbandâ€™s reliance on it is misplaced. \r\nThe record reflects both parties used marijuana early in the marriage.Â  Husband testified he had not used any illegal substance since 1991.Â  He undergoes random drug screening at work and has not failed any tests.Â  Wife continued using marijuana until at least 2004. Â Furthermore, while there is evidence of Wifeâ€™s active presence in the childrenâ€™s lives, there is also evidence of Husbandâ€™s presence, such as church attendance and occasional hunting and fishing trips.Â  Also, Wife admitted Husband is a good father. Â \r\nThe family court found Wifeâ€™s drug use and her behavior just prior to the breakup of the marriage, including her self-abuse, reflected on her stability and ability to care for the children.Â  Furthermore, the court found Wife exhibited hostility and anger throughout the separation and even during trial.Â  We find no abuse of discretion by the family court in awarding custody to Husband.Â  \r\nAdultery\r\nWife argues the family court erred in failing to grant her a divorce on the ground of adultery.Â  We disagree.\r\nEach party alleged adultery as a ground for divorce. Â Wife relied on the testimony of a former neighbor, David King.Â  King testified he and his wife argued one evening about her possible relationship with Husband.Â  King left the house and came home later that night.Â  He found his wife, wearing only a robe, â€œgrapplingâ€ on the couch with Husband.Â  The incident allegedly occurred in 1998 or 1999.Â  Husband denied he had sexual relations with Mrs. King. Â \r\nThe family court found Wife did not prove adultery.[2]Â  In South Carolina, â€œproof of adultery as a ground for divorce must be clear and positive and the infidelity must be established by a clear preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Odom v. Odom, 248 S.C. 144, 146, 149 S.E.2d 353, 354 (1966).Â  Circumstantial evidence showing opportunity and inclination to commit adultery is sufficient to establish adultery.Â  Panhorst v. Panhorst, 301 S.C. 100, 102, 390 S.E.2d 376, 377 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  If evidence of adultery is inconclusive, a divorce on the ground of adultery should be denied.Â  McLaurin v. McLaurin, 294 S.C. 132, 134, 363 S.E.2d 110, 111 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  \r\nWe defer to the family court judge, who was in the best position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses regarding an event that occurred several years prior to the partiesâ€™ separation.Â  See Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â  Accordingly, we find no error.\r\nAttorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nWife argues the family court erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees amounting to all of the equity she was entitled to in the equitable distribution award and failing to consider the Glasscock factors.Â  See Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403 S.E.2d 313 (1991). Â We disagree.\r\nThe award of attorneyâ€™s fees is at the sound discretion of the family court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, 415, 368 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1988).Â  In determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court should consider each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fees, the beneficial results obtained, the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions, and the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  In determining a reasonable amount of attorneyâ€™s fees to award, the court should consider the nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered, the time necessarily devoted to the case, counselâ€™s professional standing, the contingency of compensation, the beneficial results obtained, and the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock, 304 S.C. at 161, 403 S.E.2d at 315.Â  The family court is required to make an independent evaluation of each of the Glasscock factors.Â  Widdicombe v. Tucker-Cales, 366 S.C. 75, 92, 620 S.E.2d 333, 342 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\nThe family court found Husband to be the prevailing party and stated in its order that it considered the Glasscock factors in determining the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees to award.Â  Based on our review of the record, we find no abuse of discretion.\r\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the decision of the family court is Â \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and STILWELL, JJ.,, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]&nbsp; Neither did the court grant Husband a divorce on the ground of adultery and, at the time of the final hearing, no other ground for divorce existed.Â  Accordingly, the order resolved all remaining issues, but the parties remained married.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-090","title":"Pappas v.

Pappas and The Judges Chambers Bar &amp; Grille (collectively Plaintiffs) against Ollieâ€™s Seafood Grille &amp; Bar, Christine Goodman, and Martin Goodman (collectively Defendants) for breach of contract, unfair trade practices, and defamation allegedly resulting from an attempted purchase and sale of certain restaurant furniture and equipment.Â  In their responsive pleadings, Defendants denied Plaintiffsâ€™ allegations, asserted various affirmative defenses, and counterclaimed for breach of contract and interpleader.Â  Following a hearing on cross summary judgment motions and Plaintiffsâ€™ motion to compel, the trial judge issued an order (1) denying Plaintiffsâ€™ summary judgment motion in its entirety; (2) granting summary judgment to Defendants; (3) awarding Defendants damages, including attorney fees and costs to be determined at a subsequent hearing;Â  and (4) denying Plaintiffsâ€™ motion to compel.Â  After the hearing on Defendantsâ€™ request for attorney fees and costs, the trial judge awarded Defendants the full amount of their claimed attorney fees and costs.Â  Plaintiffs filed three notices of appeal from the trial judgeâ€™s orders.[1]Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn March 21, 2000, Pappasâ€™s son, Harry L. Pappas (Hank) and Victor Kreeger formed a limited liability company named Judges Chambers Fine Food &amp; Spirits (Food &amp; Spirits).Â  Soon after its formation, Food &amp; Spirits began operating a restaurant. \r\nOn July 19, 2000, Pappas loaned $38,714.00 to Food &amp; Spirits.Â  The loan was collateralized by a security interest in, among other things, â€œ[a]ll furniture, fixtures and equipmentâ€ of Food &amp; Spirits as set forth in an inventory dated July 18, 2000.Â  Pappas filed a UCC-1 financing statement for the loan on July 21, 2000, and thereafter loaned additional amounts to Food &amp; Spirits. \r\nOn August 31, 2000, Antonio Cerezo was admitted as a voting member of Food &amp; Spirits.Â  In addition to receiving voting rights, Cerezo became entitled to twenty-five per cent of any distributions as well as a minimum of $50,000.00 â€œin the event of the sale of liquidation or the entire LLC.â€ \r\nBecause of financial difficulties, Food &amp; Spirits closed its restaurant on June 1, 2002. Â On June 7, 2002, Cerezo obtained an attachment order from the Colleton County Court of Common Pleas on the assets of Food &amp; Spirits.Â  There appears to be no dispute that both Hank and Food &amp; Spirits were served with the attachment.Â  Nevertheless, on June 10, 2002, the assets of Food &amp; Spirits, allegedly with Cerezoâ€™s knowledge, were surrendered to Pappas to satisfy his security interest.Â  Pappas admitted he never initiated a formal foreclosure of his lien on the assets of Food &amp; Spirits.\r\nOn June 21, 2002, Pappas formed a new company separate from Food &amp; Spirits and named it The Judges Chambers Bar &amp; Grille (Chambers).Â  Pappas also obtained a lease in his own name on the restaurant property.Â  Chambers then re-opened the restaurant using the furniture, fixtures, and equipment that had earlier served as collateral for Pappasâ€™s loan to Foods &amp; Spirits, as well as other assets and licenses that Pappas himself acquired.Â  Pappas further maintained he voluntarily paid all creditors who asserted a legitimate claim against Foods &amp; Spirits.\r\nDuring the summer of 2002, Pappas, on behalf of Chambers, accepted an offer from Defendants to buy â€œall assets, tangible and intangible; excluding inventoryâ€ of â€œThe Judges Chamber[s] Restaurantâ€ for $75,000.00, including a tender of $2,000.00 in earnest money.Â  On September 4, 2002, Defendants Martin and Christine Goodman took out a mortgage on their home and allocated $73,000.00 of the loan proceeds for â€œPayoff to The Judges Chambers Restaurant, LLC.â€Â  A check for the same amount was issued from the escrow account of their closing attorney payable to â€œThe Judges Chambers Restaurant.â€ \r\nOn the day of the loan closing, Chambers and Ollieâ€™s Seafood Grille &amp; Bar (Ollieâ€™s) executed a â€œblanket conveyance, bill of sale, assignment, and agreementâ€ for â€œthe sale of the tangible and intangible assets of the business known as The Judges Chambers Bar &amp; Grill,â€ a document drafted by Defendantsâ€™ attorney.Â  The agreement contained express warranties of both title and freedom from encumbrances.Â  It also provided that, in the event of a breach, the non-breaching parties would â€œbe entitled to recover their attorney fees and expenses incurred in connection with enforcing the terms hereof.â€Â  Defendants, after tendering to Plaintiffs the balance of the sales proceeds, immediately took possession of the restaurant and changed the locks. \r\nOn September 5, 2002, the day after the closing, the Sheriff of Colleton County served Ollieâ€™s with the attachment order that Cerezo had obtained earlier.Â  Defendants then authorized a stop payment on the check given for the remainder of the purchase price.Â  Ollieâ€™s immediately advised Pappas he would be paid as soon as the attachment was released.Â  Thereafter, however, the Goodmans discovered the property at issue was subject to numerous other encumbrances.\r\nOn September 13, 2002, Defendantsâ€™ attorney faxed a letter to Plaintiffsâ€™ attorney, advising (1) the attachment on the assets conveyed by Chambers to Ollieâ€™s constituted a breach of the agreement; (2) the dispute between Chambers and Cerezo needed to be immediately resolved; and (3) a federal and/or state tax lien may have also attached to the assets.Â  Defendantsâ€™ attorney further requested â€œall pertinent information concerning any tax lienâ€ as well as a status report on the dispute between Chambers and Cerezo.Â  If the dispute between Chambers and Cerezo could not be settled, counsel suggested depositing a portion of the purchase price with the court pending resolution, leaving only the issue of a potential tax lien.Â  Finally, Defendantsâ€™ attorney advised that, if the matter could not be resolved â€œin its entiretyâ€ by the following Monday, his clients would most likely elect to rescind the transaction. \r\nOn September 23, 2002, Plaintiffs and Cerezo reached an agreement under which Cerezo agreed to dissolve his attachment and relinquish his claim to $35,000.00 of the sales proceeds.Â  On October 1, 2002, Plaintiffsâ€™ attorney e-mailed Defendantsâ€™ attorney, apparently advising of the agreement.[2]Â  Within the hour, Defendantsâ€™ attorney responded, stating his position that â€œall of the proceeds of the sale must be placed in escrow until the claims of all lien holders are resolved.â€Â  Counsel further advised that, unless all the proceeds would be escrowed until clear title was obtained, he would recommend rescission of the sale to his clients.\r\nAs best we can tell from the record, there were no further attempts to resolve the matter without litigation.Â  On October 4, 2002, Plaintiffs filed this action.Â  Among other things, Plaintiffs contended Ollieâ€™s and the Goodmans, acting individually and as authorized agents for Ollieâ€™s, breached the contract, committed unfair trade practices, and made defamatory statements.Â  \r\nOn October 31, 2002, Circuit Court Judge Cordell Maddox entered an order granting a temporary injunction purporting to require Defendants either (1) to pay $73,000.00 to Plaintiffs within ten days, or (2) to re-tender to Plaintiffs all assets conveyed under the sales agreement and to return Plaintiffs to the status quo ante. \r\nOn November 2, 2002, Defendants filed an answer generally denying the allegations of the complaint and alleging Plaintiffs did not have good title to the assets for which they were seeking payment in that the assets were subject to a judicial attachment and numerous liens.Â  Defendants also counterclaimed for damages for breach of the sales agreement. \r\nOn the same day, Defendants filed a third-party complaint against Cerezo, Food &amp; Spirits, the United States Internal Revenue Service, and the South Carolina Department of Revenue.Â  In their third-party complaint, Defendants sought to pay the disputed funds to the clerk of court and to have all claimantsâ€”including Cerezo, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Department of Revenueâ€”resolve those claims.Â  The third-party complaint, however, was never served on the Internal Revenue Service or the Department of Revenue.Â  The record is silent as to whether Food &amp; Spirits was served.\r\nOn June 3, 2003, after numerous proceedings concerning the temporary injunction, Judge Maddox entered an order finding the injunction had been granted without proper notice and ordered Defendants to deposit $73,000.00, with interest, with the Colleton County Clerk of Court to be held pending further court order.Â  On August 29, 2003, after taking Pappasâ€™s deposition, Defendantsâ€™ attorney wrote to Plaintiffsâ€™ attorney, stating in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nDespite your ongoing assurances to me and to the Court that the Pappas were â€œworkingâ€ with the various claimants, nothing has ever been done to resolve either the federal and state tax liens.Â  In addition, the Cerezo attachment remains in place.\r\n[Pappas] and Judges Chambers have had more than adequate time to get the title problems resolved and to obtain releases of the liens and encumbrances.Â  By their failure to do so, [Pappas] and Judges Chambers have repudiated the sale contract.\r\nAs a result thereof, Ollieâ€™s considers the contract a nullity and hereby demands the return of the $2,000 consideration it paid.Â  Ollieâ€™s does not waive its right to pursue Judges Chambers and [Pappas] for attorney fees, costs, and expenses it incurred as a result of their breach.\r\n\r\nDefendants moved for summary judgment on September 3, 2003.Â  Shortly thereafter, on September 22, 2003, Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment.\r\nPlaintiffs were eventually successful in obtaining written discharges from the Internal Revenue Service and the South Carolina Department of Revenue of their respective claims on the assets.Â  The Internal Revenue Service discharged its lien on October 2, 2003, and the Department of Revenue executed a partial release of its tax lien on May 28, 2004.Â  In addition, Plaintiffs sought and obtained an amended agreement from Cerezo regarding his claim as well as a consent order on May 25, 2004, dissolving Cerezoâ€™s attachment. \r\nOn November 3, 2003, after two orders of contempt had been issued against them, Defendants deposited $73,000.00 into the court.Â  On January 28, 2004, the Goodmans, pursuant to court order, deposited the interest that had accrued on the $73,000.00.\r\nOn April 27, 2004, Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel after Defendants objected to various interrogatories and requests for production.Â  It appears from the record that, although a hearing had been set on this motion, Plaintiffsâ€™ attorney agreed to a request from opposing counsel to continue the matter and have it heard with the cross summary judgment motions.\r\nThe summary judgment motions and Plaintiffsâ€™ motion to compel came before Circuit Court Judge Jackson V. Gregory on June 22, 2004.Â  By order dated July 7, 2004, the trial judge granted summary judgment to Defendants, denied Plaintiffsâ€™ motion for summary judgment â€œin its entirety,â€ and denied Plaintiffsâ€™ motion to compel.Â  The order further granted Defendants judgment against Plaintiffs for $2,000.00, the amount of the earnest money payment, as well as â€œsuch other damages as shall hereafter be found resulting from [Plaintiffsâ€™] breach of contract, . . . costs herein expended, and [Defendants] attorney fees expended as a result of . . . Plaintiffsâ€™ breach of contract as provided in the contract, as determined by the Court upon subsequent hearing.â€ \r\nOn July 9, 2004, Plaintiffs moved to alter or amend the trial judgeâ€™s order.Â  On July 14, 2004, Defendantsâ€™ attorney requested in an e-mail that the motion be decided without oral argument pursuant to Rule 59(f) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  Plaintiffsâ€™ attorney responded by e-mail that he objected to proceeding without oral argument and alternatively requested a schedule for filing briefs.Â  On July 16, 2004, the trial judge notified both attorneys by e-mail that he had been holding court in another circuit and had not received either the motion to alter or amend or the e-mails concerning whether a hearing or additional briefing was warranted.Â  He further advised counsel that, upon receipt of Plaintiffsâ€™ motion, he would decide what to do regarding the matter.Â  By order dated July 27, 2004, apparently without further communication to either side, the trial judge issued an order denying the motion and stating the denial was â€œwithout a hearing.â€Â  In the order, he noted that â€œ[t]he issues have previously been briefed and argued by counsel[;] therefore[,] another hearing or further briefs would serve no purpose.â€Â  Plaintiffs filed their first notice of appeal on August 6, 2004.\r\nOn September 7, 2004, Defendants made a motion for clarification of the July 7, 2004 order, in which the trial judge granted them summary judgment.Â  In the motion, Defendants alleged the Colleton County Clerk of Court erroneously removed the case from the jury roster following the notice of appeal, but maintained the trial court had continuing jurisdiction to determine their damages.Â  They further requested an order directing the Colleton County Clerk of Court to release the funds deposited with the court on the ground that they were awarded the funds as a money judgment that was not subject to the automatic stay resulting from Plaintiffsâ€™ appeal.Â  In the alternative, Defendants requested the trial court to lift the automatic stay so they could receive the funds.\r\nPlaintiffsâ€™ initial brief in the above-referenced appeal was filed in this court on February 25, 2005.Â  In this brief, Plaintiffs did not challenge either the trial judgeâ€™s determination that Defendants were entitled to recover â€œtheir attorney fees expended as a result of the Plaintiffsâ€™ breach of contract as provided in the contractâ€ or his instruction that the amount to be recovered would be â€œdetermined by the Court upon subsequent hearing.â€ Â Â \r\nOn May 6, 2005, the trial judge held a hearing on Defendantsâ€™ motion for clarification.Â  On May 19, 2005, the trial judge issued an order finding his earlier order did not need clarification and declined to lift the stay; however, he also scheduled a hearing for August 12, 2005, on Defendantsâ€™ claim for attorney fees and costs.Â  In preparation for this hearing, he directed Defendants to provide Plaintiffs with evidence supporting their claims and Plaintiffs to serve rebuttal evidence within twenty days thereafter.Â  Plaintiffs served no rebuttal evidence and made no response to the evidence Defendants submitted.\r\nOn July 7, 2005, Plaintiffs petitioned this court to review the order dated May 19, 2005, and to â€œreinstate the appellate stay as to further proceedings in the lower court during the pendency of the appeal.â€Â  Defendants filed both a return to the petition and their own petition for review of the same order.Â  In Defendantsâ€™ petition, they requested this court to enter an order lifting any stay of the provision in the summary judgment order concerning release of the funds on deposit with the Colleton County Clerk of Court and denying the relief requested in Plaintiffsâ€™ petition.[3]Â  \r\nAt the hearing on August 12, 2005, Plaintiffs asserted the trial court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter before it and reiterated their demand for a jury trial.Â  When the trial judge[4] refused to submit the claim to a jury, Plaintiffs immediately hand-served a notice of appeal of this oral ruling during the hearing and declined to participate further.Â  The trial judge proceeded with the hearing, apparently with only Defendants present, and, by order dated September 12, 2005, awarded Defendants $77,437.50 as attorney fees and costs.Â  In response to this order, Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal, their third such notice in this lawsuit, on September 20, 2005. \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Plaintiffs first contend that, because the sales agreement did not incorporate the provisions of South Carolina Code section 36-2-609[5] as a remedy for an alleged breach of warranty, Defendants could not claim repudiation under this section.Â  In conjunction with this argument, Plaintiffs contend Defendantsâ€™ only remedy under the agreement for a breach of warranty of title was indemnification.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nUnder South Carolina Code section 36-2-719(1), although a sales contract â€œmay provide for remedies in addition to or in substitution for those provided in this chapter,â€ the party seeking redress is not limited to such remedies â€œunless the remedy is expressly agreed to be exclusive, in which case it is the sole remedy.â€[6]Â  Although, as Plaintiffs note, the contract included a provision that the agreement â€œcontains the entire agreement and understanding of the parties,â€ it does not expressly limit the remedies available to an aggrieved party.[7] Â \r\n2.Â  We decline to address Plaintiffsâ€™ argument that Defendants waived their right to rely on the remedial provisions in section 36-2-609 by (1) failing to allege repudiation as either a defense in their answer or a cause of action in their counterclaim, and (2) representing that they would make payment as required by the sales agreement if Plaintiffs resolved the alleged claims by Cerezo and the federal and state tax liens.Â  The summary judgment order did not address either of these arguments, and Plaintiffs did not raise either issue in their motion to alter or amend.[8]Â  \r\n3.Â  Plaintiffs next argue that the trial judge erred in concluding Defendants were entitled to cancellation or rescission of the contract.Â  In support of this argument, Plaintiffs assert (1) they â€œimmediately and systematically began addressing the adverse claims and ultimately resolved those claims; therefore,Â  . . . there was never a reasonable ground for Defendants to be insecure about Plaintiffsâ€™ performance under the Sales Agreement; and (2) there was an issue of material of fact concerning whether Plaintiffs, in undertaking to resolve the liens and to hold Defendants harmless, provided adequate assurance that they would perform as required by the agreement.Â  Plaintiffs further correctly point out the South Carolina Reporterâ€™s Comments to section 36-2-609 explicitly state â€œ[t]he reasonableness of the grounds for insecurity (and thus the justification for the demanding assurance of performance) and the adequacy of any assurance offered are questions of fact.â€Â  \r\nNotwithstanding this comment, we uphold the trial judgeâ€™s determination that Plaintiffs failed to submit evidence presenting genuine issues of material fact concerning whether Defendants had a reasonable ground for insecurity and whether Plaintiffs provided adequate assurances.[9]\r\nAs to Defendantsâ€™ grounds for insecurity, the trial judge stated in the appealed order:Â  â€œIt goes without saying, when the Attachment was levied by the Sheriff upon the Assets, Ollieâ€™s had reasonable grounds for insecurity.â€Â  On appeal, Plaintiffs have neither offered any legal authority to challenge this conclusion nor directed our attention to any evidence in the record indicating why Defendants, upon discovering the various liens and encumbrances on the restaurant assets, should not have been concerned that they would not receive good title to the property as called for by the contract.[10]\r\nSimilarly, although the Reporterâ€™s Comments state the adequacy of assurances is a fact question, we have found no evidence in the record before us presenting a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether Plaintiffsâ€™ actions in response to Defendantsâ€™ concerns about the numerous liens on the assets constituted adequate assurances that they would perform as required by the agreement.Â  \r\nIn his letter of September 13, 2002, counsel for Ollieâ€™s advised Plaintiffs of his concern about not only the Cerezo attachment but the federal and state tax liens as well.Â  Although Plaintiffs made some attempt to resolve the Cerezo attachment, we have found nothing in the record indicating a prompt attempt by Plaintiffs to address the tax liens.Â  Significantly, although Defendantsâ€™ attorney advised on October 1, 2002, that he would not consent to releasing the sales proceeds until all liens on the assets were resolved, there is no evidence that Plaintiffs attempted to provide any assurances at all within thirty days after this communication. Â Instead, Plaintiffs apparently chose to respond to this communication by filing this litigation just a few days later.Â  The resolution of a number of the liens shortly before the summary judgment motions were heard does not create an issue of fact as to whether Defendants had reasonable grounds for insecurity at the time they became aware the assets were subject to encumbrances or whether Plaintiffs provided timely and adequate assurances when called to do so.[11]Â  \r\n4.Â  In conjunction with the above argument, Plaintiffs assert that, even if they were properly deemed to have repudiated the sales agreement, the trial court should have awarded Defendants damages according South Carolina Code section 36-2-713 instead of allowing Defendants to retain possession of the purchase price.[12]Â  Because, however, the summary judgment order did not address the applicability of section 36-2-713 and Plaintiffs failed to raise this issue in their motion to alter or amend, we decline to address this argument.[13]\r\n5.Â  Plaintiffs further argue summary judgment was premature in view of the fact that they had not completed discovery and had a pending motion to compel.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nPlaintiffs contend that the trial judge mistakenly believed they waived their right to be heard on their motion to compel because, as a matter of courtesy, their attorney agreed that Defendantsâ€™ attorney could argue his summary judgment motion first because it was filed earlier. Â From the transcript of the proceedings, however, it is evident the trial judge was referring to Plaintiffsâ€™ waiver of their request to amend their complaint and concluded that, because the discovery at issue would have been probative only on the causes of action that Plaintiffs sought to add in an amended pleading, a motion to compel was not warranted.[14]  \r\nAs to the motion itself, we find no reason to reverse the trial judgeâ€™s decision to deny it.Â  The discovery sought included lists of revenues and expenses of the restaurant, various financial statements concerning Defendantsâ€™ current net worth, and profit and loss statements and similar documents.Â  Although this information was arguably probative on the issue of whether Defendants were able to operate the restaurant and receive income from the business, it is irrelevant to whether Defendants had due cause for concern because of the numerous encumbrances on the restaurant assets or whether Plaintiffs acted reasonably in assuaging this concern.[15]\r\n6.Â  We reject Plaintiffsâ€™ contention that the trial judge erred in denying their motion to alter or amend without first holding oral argument or requesting and receiving a brief from them.Â Â  Under Rule 59(f) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, a motion to alter or amend â€œmay in the discretion of the court be determined on briefs filed by the parties without oral argument.â€[16]\r\nIn Pollard v. County of Florence, this court held the trial court did not err in declining to entertain oral argument on a motion to alter or amend.Â  Noting the appellant had submitted a seven-page motion setting forth arguments on all issues raised, we held the trial court committed no abuse of discretion in dispensing with oral argument.[17]Â  Â \r\nPlaintiffs argue that Pollard supports the conclusion that a trial judge should not decide a motion under Rule 59(e) in the absence of both briefs and oral argument.Â  Applying this conclusion to the present case, they assert that, in contrast to the materials submitted by the appellant in Pollard, their own post-trial motion â€œwas succinct and could not be characterized as the functional equivalent of a brief.â€Â  Significantly, however, Plaintiffs stated in the motion that the grounds for their arguments â€œare set forth in Plaintiffsâ€™ memoranda formerly filed with the Court, the arguments made by Plaintiffs at the June 22, 2004 hearing, and the arguments to be asserted by Plaintiffs at the hearing on this motion.â€Â  We see no meaningful distinction between Plaintiffsâ€™ incorporation by reference of their prior memoranda and oral arguments in the case and the detailed post-trial motion submitted in Pollard; both are the functional equivalents of a brief.\r\n7.Â  Plaintiffs further appeal the dismissal of their claim for defamation.Â  We find no error.Â  \r\nIn this cause of action, Plaintiffs alleged Defendants â€œpublished to members of the public the false statement that Defendants were unable to obtain a liquor license due to wrongful acts and/or omission of Plaintiffs.â€Â  The only alleged defamatory statement addressed in the appealed order was purportedly made by an unidentified â€œgirl at the barâ€ that Plaintiffs had â€œcheatedâ€ or â€œscrewedâ€ Defendants in Defendantsâ€™ attempt to obtain a liquor license.Â  As noted by the trial judge, Plaintiffs argued that â€œbecause the â€˜girl at the barâ€™ was purportedly an employee of Ollieâ€™s, that that is circumstantial evidence to support the claim that the statement was also made by the Goodmans or that the statement should be attributed to Ollieâ€™s.â€Â  \r\nAmong other reasons, the trial judge found Plaintiffs failed to present evidence that the alleged slander was either actionable per se or caused specific harm.[18]Â  On appeal, Plaintiffs do not challenge the finding that they made no showing concerning specific harm.Â  Regarding the finding that the statement at issue was not actionable per se, they assert only that â€œthe statements related to Plaintiffsâ€™ fitness in business.â€Â  Without any elaboration or supporting legal authority for this assertion, we hold this argument is conclusory and decline to address it.[19]Â  Because, then, we see no reason to disturb the trial judgeâ€™s finding that the alleged slander was neither actionable per se or caused Plaintiffs specific harm, we affirm the grant of summary judgment to Defendants on this cause of action.[20]\r\n8.Â  Plaintiffs take issue with the award of attorney fees and costs to Defendants, asserting the trial judge lacked jurisdiction to make such an award while their appeal in the case was pending.Â  We disagree.Â  Although, as Plaintiffs note, Rule 225(a) of the South Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure states â€œthe service of a notice of appeal in a civil matter acts to automatically stay matters decided in the order on appeal,â€[21] this rule also grants the trial court continuing jurisdiction to hear matters â€œnot affected by the appeal.â€[22]Â  As the supreme court stated in Jackson v. Speed, so long as the basis for an award of attorney fees is not challenged on appeal, the determination of the amount of those fees is â€œnot affected by the appealâ€ and the trial court has jurisdiction to proceed on this issue.[23]\r\n9.Â  We further hold the trial judge did not lose the power to determine the amount of the fees to be awarded simply because the term of court ended before the hearing scheduled on this issue.Â  Despite the end of a court term, a circuit judge always has the power to adjudicate issues presented to him or her within that term.[24]  \r\n10. Assuming without deciding that Plaintiffs timely appealed their right to have a jury decide the attorney fees award, we find no error in the trial judgeâ€™s decision that a jury trial was not warranted on this issue. Â \r\nIn support of their argument, Plaintiffs cite Rule 38(a) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides in pertinent part that â€œ[i]ssues of fact in an action for the recovery of money only . . . must be tried by a jury, unless a jury trial be waived.â€[25]Â  With regard to the issue of attorney fees award in this particular case, however, the trial judge had already determined that Defendants could recover attorney fees and costs, the only question remaining being the amount to which they were entitled.Â  Such an amount is a matter of law.Â Â Â  As the supreme court noted in Enoree v. Yarborough, \r\n\r\nThere may arise cases, of course, where the right to recover any fees at all may depend upon certain issues of fact which involve that right. In law cases such issues should be submitted to the jury; but in all cases, law and equity, in which there is no dispute as to the facts and the only issue is as to the reasonable amount of the fee, that becomes a question of law to be determined by the court, either with or without expert testimony and with or without the assistance of the jury as the court may desire.[26]  \r\n\r\nWe hold the trial judge acted within his discretion in dispensing with a jury trial on the issue of the amount of attorney fees and costs to be awarded to Defendants.Â  The only issue before the trial judge was the â€œreasonable amountâ€ of fees and costs to which Defendants were entitled.Â  As this court has noted, the question of â€œ[w]hat constitutes a reasonable [attorney] fee is a matter for the court to determine as a matter [of] informed judicial discretion.â€[27]\r\n11. Finally, Plaintiffs assert a number of reasons as to why the award of attorney fees and costs should not stand.Â  These reasons are as follows:Â  (1) the trial judge failed to discuss the required six factors to support its award, and Defendants failed to present evidence to a number of these factors; (2) Defendants made no effort to segregate the fees claimed between Ollieâ€™s and the Goodmans, who were not parties to the contract; (3) the amounts claimed included attorney fees that were not incurred in conjunction with enforcing the contract; (4) the evidence submitted by Defendants related to issues necessitated by Defendantsâ€™ conduct in the litigation and upon which Plaintiffs prevailed; (5) Defendantsâ€™ attorney never provided evidence about the fees charged, the reasonableness or of the fees, or the timeÂ  spent on the activity; and (6) the costs awarded exceeded those permitted by law.Â  \r\nWe reject these arguments. Â Â Â Â  It is undisputed that, contrary to the trial judgeâ€™s instructions, Plaintiffs failed to respond to the evidence submitted by Defendants on the issue of attorney fees and costs or submit evidence of their own on this issue.Â  In addition, Plaintiffs declined to participate in the hearing and made no post-trial motion to have the trial judge review their assertions of error.Â  We agree with Defendantsâ€™ statement that â€œ[Plaintiffs] cannot sit back, offer no evidence or argument, refuse to participate in the attorney fee hearing, make no post hearing motion to bring alleged error to the attention of the Circuit Court, and then raise on appeal issues never presented below.â€[28] Â Under these circumstances, we hold Plaintiffs have not presented any meritorious grounds on which this court should set aside the award of attorney fees and costs.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Case number 14771 corresponds to Plaintiffsâ€™ first notice of appeal and concerns Plaintiffsâ€™ appeal of the denial of their motion to compel and the grant of summary judgment to Defendants.Â  Case number 14745 corresponds to Plaintiffsâ€™ second and third notices of appeal and concerns the award of attorney fees and costs.\r\n[2]Â  The text of the message sent by Plaintiffsâ€™ attorney suggests the agreement was in an e-mail attachment; however, the attachment itself was not in the record.\r\n[3]Â  This court denied both petitions on May 12, 2006.\r\n[4]Â  Judge Gregory presided at the hearing on attorney fees and costs as well as the hearing on the cross summary judgment motions and Plaintiffsâ€™ motion to compel.\r\n[5]Â  This section, entitled â€œRight to adequate assurance of performance,â€ provides in pertinent part that â€œ[a]fter receipt of a justified demand failure to provide within a reasonable time not exceeding thirty days such assurance of due performance as is adequate under the circumstances of the particular case is a repudiation of the contract.â€Â  S.C.

Bochette, 300 S.C. 109, 112, 386 S.E.2d 475, 477 (Ct.

Carpenter, and Carmen V. Ganjehsani, of Columbia; Michael S. Hopewell, of Florence; for Appellant-Respondent.Â  \r\nDaniel Francis Blanchard, III, and Susan Corner Rosen, of Charleston; Peter Fredrick Asmer, Jr., of Charlotte; for Respondent-Appellants.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  On cross-appeals from a default judgment, Sundown Operating Company, Sunrise Coin Company, and High Noon Properties, Inc. (collectively Sundown) contend the master-in-equity erred in (1) failing to award prejudgment interest, (2) invalidating the August 28, 2001 service of the summons and complaint, and (3) finding BFPE International, Inc. f/k/a Atlantic Fire Systems, Inc.â€™s motion complied with Rules 6(d) and 7(b)(1) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  BFPE contends the master erred in failing to find that the October 2, 2001 entry of default should be voided as a matter of law and the master erred in failing to set aside the default judgment.Â Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn September 16, 1998, a fire destroyed a restaurant and pub owned and operated by Sundown.Â  It is alleged that the fire was caused when a heating element in an electric fryer â€œfailed in an area that was submerged in frying oil causing the frying oil to ignite and burn.â€Â  According to Sundown, the electric fryer was missing a high limit safety thermostat, which was supposed to automatically shut off the power to the heating unit once the frying oil temperature exceeded the safety thermostatâ€™s high temperature set point and would have allowed the frying oil to cool instead of igniting.Â  Sundown also alleges that it had a service contract with BFPE to install, maintain, inspect and service Sundownâ€™s fire equipment, including range hood fire extinguishing systems and fire suppression systems. Â \r\nOn August 24, 2001, Sundown filed a Summons and Complaint against five defendants, including BFPE. Â In its complaint, Sundown asserted causes of action for negligence and breach of contract against BFPE, alleging BFPE failed to properly inspect and maintain the fire suppression system.Â  Sundown further alleged that the fire suppression system failed to operate properly, causing the fire to spread. Â Sundown sought actual and punitive damages and â€œinterest as provided by lawâ€ against all defendants, including BFPE.Â  \r\nBFPE is incorporated in Maryland and has nine business locations throughout Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.Â  Because BFPE does not have a registered agent listed with the South Carolina Secretary of State, Sundown attempted to serve Donald R. Leonard, who was BFPEâ€™s registered agent in Maryland and North Carolina.Â  On August 27, 2001, Sundown sent two copies of its Summons and Complaint to Leonard, at two separate addresses, Myrtle Beach, SC and Rocky Mount, NC.Â  On August 28, 2001, service was accepted at the Myrtle Beach address. Â However, service was not accepted by Leonard, but rather by Randy Adams who signed Leonardâ€™s name.Â  Apparently, Adams asked the postal carrier if he could sign for Leonard who advised him that he could.Â  \r\nThe second set of the Summons and Complaint was received and signed for by Leonard on September 4, 2001.Â  On or about September 5, 2001, Leonard gave the Summons and Complaint to David McGlynn, BFPEâ€™s general manager in Clayton, North Carolina. Â Glynn forwarded the papers to BFPEâ€™s Vice President, George Hill, in Hanover, Maryland. Â According to Hill, on September 14, 2001, he then forwarded a letter with copies of the Summons and Complaint to John Doetzer of Consolidated Insurance Carrier, BFPEâ€™s insurance agent. Â Â There is a dispute, however, over when Doetzer received the documents.Â  Doetzer stated that the Summons and Complaint were not enclosed with the September 14, 2001 letter and were not forwarded to him until October 1, 2001.Â  \r\nOn October 2, 2001, Doetzer telephoned Sundownâ€™s counsel to inquire about an extension of time to file an Answer. Â Sundownâ€™s counsel informed Doetzer that an entry of default had already been forwarded to the clerk of court and that an extension would most likely not be granted. Â Default was entered on the same day based upon Sundownâ€™s Affidavit of Service by Certified Mail filed on September 17, 2001.Â  On October 15, 2001, suit papers were sent by BFPEâ€™s insurance carrier, CNA Insurance Company, to the assigned defense counsel for BFPE.Â  \r\nOn October 18, 2001, BFPE filed a Notice of Motion and Motion to Set Aside Default and to Permit Enlargement of Time. Â On October 29, 2001, Sundown filed a Motion for Judgment by Default against BFPE based on the August 28, 2001 service date and entry of default on October 2, 2001.Â  Sundown then filed another Affidavit of Counsel in Support of Entry of Default based on the September 4, 2001 service date.Â  A second entry of default based on the September 4, 2001 service of process was entered on December 10, 2001.Â  \r\nA hearing was set for March 18, 2002 to hear BFPEâ€™s Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default.Â  On March 12 and 14, 2002, BFPE filed seven affidavits in support of its motion.Â  At the hearing, the circuit court allowed BFPE to file an Answer, based partly on the holding in Pilgrim v. Miller, 2002 WL 44112 (S.C. Ct. App. Jan. 14, 2002).Â  However, upon learning that this court had granted a Petition for Rehearing in the Pilgrim case, the circuit court decided to delay issuing its opinion.Â  On June 17, 2002, this court reversed the earlier opinion, affirming the trial courtâ€™s denial of the motion to set aside the default in that case.Â  See Pilgrim v. Miller, 305 S.C. 637, 567 S.E.2d 52 (Ct. App. 2002).[1]Â  On July 18, 2002, the circuit court held a second hearing on BFPEâ€™s motion to set aside the default and denied BFPEâ€™s motion.Â Â  \r\nOn September 28, 2004, an Order of Reference was issued referring the case to the master for a hearing to assess damages against BFPE and for the issuance of a final order.Â  After the damages hearing, the master entered separate judgments in favor of Sundown as follows:Â  (1) an award of $273,336.00 in actual damages to Sunrise; (2) an award of $394,848.38 in actual damages to Sundown Operating Company; and (3) an award of $524,800.70 in actual damages to High Noon. Â The master denied Sundownâ€™s request for prejudgment interest.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPrejudgment Interest\r\nSundown contends the master erred in failing to award prejudgment interest.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAn award of prejudgment interest is within the discretion of the fact-finder and will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion.Â  See Knight v. Sullivan Power Co., 140 S.C. 296, 304, 138 S.E. 818, 820-21 (1927) (stating that in exercising its discretion, a jury â€œmight assess interest as a part of the damagesâ€).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when an order is controlled by an error of law or when the order is without evidentiary support. Â Thompson v. Hammond, 299 S.C. 116, 119, 382 S.E.2d 900, 902-903 (1989).Â  \r\nInitially, we address BFPEâ€™s argument that Sundown failed to specifically plead for the recovery of prejudgment interest in its complaint as required by South Carolina law.Â  It has been well established under South Carolina law that parties must plead for prejudgment interest in order for it to be recovered.Â  See McMillan v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Agric., 364 S.C. 60, 74, 611 S.E.2d 323, 330 (Ct. App. 2005) (â€œPrejudgment interest must be specifically pled in order to be recovered.â€)Â  â€œIf no request for prejudgment interest is made in the pleadings, it cannot be recovered on appeal.â€Â  Tilley v. Pacesetter Corp., 355 S.C. 361, 375, 585 S.E.2d 292, 299 (2003) (citation omitted).Â  \r\nIn its complaint, Sundown makes only a general request for â€œinterest as provided by law.â€Â  This request is too general and vague to meet the strict requirement that a demand for prejudgment interest must be specifically pled.Â  Sundown offers numerous cases for the proposition that a pleading such as its is sufficient.Â  However, all of the cases cited are outside this jurisdiction, and South Carolina case law is controlling. Â Accordingly, Sundown did not sufficiently plead prejudgment interest and thus should not be awarded such.Â  \r\nHowever, even if this court were to find Sundown sufficiently pled prejudgment interest, the master was correct in refusing the award.Â  Sundown argues it is entitled to an award of prejudgment interest under two theories.Â  First, Sundown argues it should be awarded prejudgment interest as an element of damages.Â  \r\nSundown cites to the cases of Knight v. Sullivan Power Co., 140 S.C. 296, 138 S.E. 818 (1927) and Wilson &amp; Co. v. Atlanta &amp; Charlotte Airline Ry., 16 S.C. 587 (1882) for the proposition that prejudgment interest can be recovered in tort claims.Â  However, in both of these cases it was recognized that a plaintiff could not recover interest as a matter of right or interest eo nominee, which means â€œunder that name,â€Â  and that it would have been possible error for a jury to have specifically awarded interest eo nominee.Â  Knight at 304, 138 S.E. at 820-21; Wilson 16 S.C. 587. Â In each case, the jury merely awarded lump sum damages, and it was impossible for the appellate court to have determined whether the jury did in fact include interest in the verdicts.Â  \r\nMore recent South Carolina cases dealing with prejudgment interest state that, as a general rule, prejudgment interest is not recoverable on an unliquidated claim in the absence of agreement or statute.Â  See Builders Transp., Inc. v. S.C. Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Guar. Assoc., 307 S.C. 398, 406, 415 S.E.2d 419, 424 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  â€œA claim is liquidated if the sum claimed is certain or capable of being reduced to a certainty.â€Â  Id.Â  Unliquidated claims that are capable of being reduced to certainty by a simple mathematical calculation can be considered liquidated for the purpose of awarding prejudgment interest under South Carolina law. Â Id.Â  Liquidated damages â€œare damages the amount of which has been made certain and fixed either by the act and agreement of the parties or by operation of law to a sum which cannot be changed by the proof.â€Â  22 Am. Jur. 2d Damages Â§ 489 (2003).\r\nThe facts of this case demonstrate that Sundownâ€™s claim was not capable of being reduced to a certainty. Â Sundownâ€™s damages are simply not of the type that can be made certain or cannot be changed by proof.Â  In order to determine the damages to be awarded, the master had to consider the testimony of fact witnesses, expert witnesses and exhibits admitted into evidence.Â  There was no fixed formula used for determining the amount of Sundownâ€™s damages.Â Â  At the time the claim arose, the date of the fire, conditions were not fixed for determining the amount of Sundownâ€™s damages to a sum certain.Â  The testimony of Sundownâ€™s fact witnesses and the exhibits presented by Sundown demonstrate the measure of recovery was not fixed on the date of the fire.Â  Furthermore, many of Sundownâ€™s damages did not even arise until after the date of the fire, such as the lost profits and revenues, loan and interest charges, legal and permit fees, storage charges, and rental income.Â  Accordingly, Sundownâ€™s damages were not liquidated, and therefore, Sundown was not entitled to prejudgment interest as an element of damages.Â  \r\nAs its second argument, Sundown argues it should be awarded prejudgment interest pursuant to section 34-31-20(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005), which provides:Â  \r\n\r\nIn all cases of accounts stated and in all cases wherein any sum or sums of money shall be ascertained and, being due, shall draw interest according to law, the legal interest shall be at the rate of eight and three-fourths percent per annum.Â  \r\n\r\nWhile all parties agree that the instant case does not involve an account stated, Sundown contends it involves damages that are readily ascertainable and capable of being reduced to a sum certain.Â  Based on the reasoning stated above, this argument fails, and Sundown is not entitled to an award of prejudgment interest.Â  \r\nService of Process Issues\r\nBFPE contends the October 2, 2001 entry of default should be voided because it was based on a service of process that was later found to be insufficient.Â  BFPE argues that if this court voids the October 2, 2001 entry of default, the masterâ€™s order should also be voided because it was based on the October 2, 2001 entry of default.Â  We disagree.Â  Furthermore, as an additional sustaining ground Sundown contends the October 2, 2001 entry of default should not be voided because the circuit court erred in invalidating the August 28, 2001 service.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nQuestions of fact arising on a motion to quash service of process for lack of jurisdiction over the defendant are to be determined by the court. Lawson v. Jeter, 243 S.C. 103, 106, 132 S.E.2d 276, 277 (1963). Appellate courts are bound by the circuit courtâ€™s finding on such issues unless they are â€œwholly unsupported by the evidence or manifestly influenced or controlled by error of law.â€ Â Id.Â  The plaintiff has the burden to establish that the court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant. Jensen v. Doe, 292 S.C. 592, 594, 358 S.E.2d 148, 149 (Ct. App. 1987). The plaintiff need only show compliance with the rules. Â Roche v. Young Bros., Inc., 318 S.C. 207, 211, 456 S.E.2d 897, 900 (1995). â€œWhen the civil rules on service are followed, there is a presumption of proper service.â€ Â Id. (citing 62B Am Jur 2d Process Â§ 111 (1990)). \r\nSundown is correct in arguing that the circuit court erred in voiding the August 28, 2001 service of process.Â Â  BFPE has failed to show that Adams was unauthorized to accept service of process for BFPE.Â  See Roche, 318 S.C. at 211, 456 S.E.2d at 900 (stating that under Rule 4(d)(8), the defendant, not the plaintiff, must prove that the receipt was signed by an unauthorized person, and the plaintiff need only show compliance with the rules).Â  The procedural rules governing service upon a corporation state in pertinent part that personal service shall be made as follows:Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n(3) Corporations and Partnerships. Upon a corporation or upon a partnership or other unincorporated association which is subject to suit under a common name, by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to an officer, a managing or general agent, or to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process and if the agent is one authorized by statute to receive service and the statute so requires, by also mailing a copy to the defendant.\r\n(8) Service by Certified Mail. Service of a summons and complaint upon a defendant of any class referred to in paragraph (1) or (3) of this subdivision of this rule may be made by the plaintiff or by any person authorized to serve process pursuant to Rule 4(c), including a sheriff or his deputy, by registered\r\nor certified mail, return receipt requested and delivery restricted to the addressee. Service is effective upon the date of delivery as shown on the return receipt. Service pursuant to this paragraph shall not be the basis for the entry of a default or a judgment by default unless the record contains a return receipt showing the acceptance by the defendant. Any such default or judgment by default shall be set aside pursuant to Rule 55(c) or Rule 60(b) if the defendant demonstrates to the court that the return receipt was signed by an unauthorized person. If delivery of the process is refused or is returned undelivered, service shall be made as otherwise provided by these rules.\r\n\r\nRule 4(d)(3), (8), SCRCP.Â  Under Rule 4(d), service may be effected upon a â€œmanaging or general agentâ€ of a corporation â€œeven though the managing or general agent was not specifically authorized by the corporation to accept service.â€Â  62B Am. Jur. 2d Process Â§ 272 (1990).Â  In Adamsâ€™ affidavit, he states that he is the â€œmanagerâ€ of BFPEâ€™s location in Wilmington, North Carolina, and was working at BFPEâ€™s locations in Myrtle Beach on August 28, 2001.Â  \r\nFurthermore, in Schenk v. National Health Care, Inc., 322 S.C. 316, 319-20, 471 S.E.2d 736, 737-8 (Ct. App. 1996), this court held that service was proper on a corporate defendant when the summons and complaint were delivered to the an office manager who told the process server that she would pass the papers along to headquarters.Â Â Â  Sundown has shown compliance with the rules for service, and BFPE has failed to show Adams was not authorized to accept service.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court erred in finding the August 28, 2001 service of process invalid.Â  Additionally, because the August 28, 2001 service of process was valid, the October 2, 2001 entry of default was valid as well.Â  \r\nMotion to Set Aside Entry of Default\r\nBFPE argues the circuit court erred in failing to set aside the October 2, 2001, entry of default.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe decision of whether to set aside an entry of default or a default judgment lies solely within the sound discretion of the trial judge, and such a decision will not be reversed absent an abuse of that discretion. Â Thompson v. Hammond, 299 S.C. 116, 119, 382 S.E.2d 900, 902-03 (1989).\r\nAn abuse of discretion occurs when the order was controlled by an error of law or when the order is without evidentiary support. Â Id.\r\nAs a preliminary matter, BFPE contends the circuit court erred in employing the wrong standard in its order denying the motion to set aside default.Â  In matters concerning a default judgment, Rule 55, SCRCP, states default may be entered when a party â€œagainst whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend as provided by these rules and that fact is made to appear by affidavit or otherwise.â€Â  An entry of default may be set aside â€œ[f]or good cause shownâ€ and, if a â€œjudgment by default has been entered, [the court] may likewise set it aside in accordance with Rule 60(b).â€Â  See Rule 55(c), SCRCP.Â  Rule 60(b), SCRCP, states that relief from judgment or order may be given based on the following:Â  \r\n\r\n(b) Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly Discovered Evidence; Fraud, etc. On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:\r\n    \r\n  (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;\r\n\r\n  (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b);\r\n\r\n  (3) fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party;\r\n\r\n  (4) the judgment is void;\r\n\r\n  (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court clearly used the correct standard in upholding the entry of default.Â  In its order, the circuit court specifically stated that â€œin order to have an entry of default set aside, a defaulting party must show that there is â€˜good causeâ€™ for doing so.â€Â  The circuit court went on to say that â€œas a practical matter, the criteria for obtaining relief from a judgment under SCRCP 60(b) â€“ mistake, inadvertence, excusable neglect, surprise, newly discovered evidence, fraud, misrepresentation â€“ are also relevant in determining whether good cause has been shown under SCRCP 55(c), although the factors are applied with greater liberality within the context of Rule 55(c) vis-Ã -vis Rule 60(b).â€Â Â  The circuit court was correct in this assessment.Â  See Hill v. Dotts, 345 S.C. 304, 310, 547 S.E.2d 894, 897 (Ct. App. 2001).Â Â  The circuit court went on to correctly apply these factors in finding that no basis for setting aside the entry of default existed.Â  \r\nNext, BFPE contends the circuit court erred in failing to set aside the entry of default because it satisfied the factors as laid out in the case of Wham v. Shearson Lehman Bros., Inc., 298 S.C. 462, 381 S.E.2d 499 (Ct.Â  App. 1989), and because there was good cause.Â  Wham lists three factors to be used when deciding to set aside an entry of default under Rule 55(c).Â Â  These are\r\n(1) the timing of the motion for relief; (2) whether there is a meritorious defense; and (3) the degree of prejudice if relief is granted.Â  Id. at 465, 381 S.E.2d at 501-2.Â  BFPE filed its motion to set aside the entry of default on October 18, 2001, and did not file its memoranda supporting this motion until March 18, 2002.Â  Though BFPE asserts it has a meritorious defense as required by Wham, the timing of the motion, the prejudice that would ensue, coupled with the standard of review this court must follow in setting aside an entry of default prevents this court from finding the circuit court erred in failing to set aside the entry of default.Â  \r\nAdditionally, BFPE contends there was good cause to set aside the entry of default because the circuit court partially relied on the case of Pilgrim v. Miller, 350 S.C. 637, 567 S.E.2d 527 (Ct. App. 2002) for its finding that a party did not demonstrate good cause for setting aside the entry of default when her insurer had negligently failed to answer a complaint filed against her despite the fact that the party had promptly delivered the suit papers to her insurer well within the time allotted for answering.Â  In Pilgrim, this court held that the insurerâ€™s â€œfailure to answer the complaint is imputed toâ€ the defaulting party.Â  Id. At 642, 567 S.E.2d 529.Â  BFPE contends the trial court erred in relying on Pilgrim because the case was later vacated on April 25, 2003, almost a year after the trial court issued its opinion.Â Â Â  \r\nHowever, the case law the Pilgrim court based its decision on is still good law.Â  The courts of this state have consistently held that the negligence of an attorney or insurance company is imputable to a defaulting litigant.\r\nÂ See Roberts v. Peterson, 292 S.C. 149, 151, 355 S.E.2d 280, 281 (Ct. App. 1987) (noting, in a case involving the failure of a school official to answer a complaint on behalf of a school employee, that â€œthe negligence in the failure to act was more excusable, we think, than the cases involving attorneys or insurance companiesâ€); see also Ledford v. Pa. Life Ins. Co., 267 S.C. 671, 677, 230 S.E.2d 900, 903 (1976) (holding, on appeal of an order vacating a default judgment, that an insurance company attorneyâ€™s failure to answer the complaint was not such mistake or excusable neglect as to warrant vacation of the default judgment).Â Â  Accordingly, the circuit court based its denial of the motion to set aside entry of default on theories that are still sound in todayâ€™s case law. Â Â Â \r\nBFPE argues that the conflicting case of Ricks v. Weinrauch, 293 S.C. 372, 373-75, 360 S.E.2d 535, 536-37 (Ct. App. 1987) (relying on Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Ramey, 318 S.E.2d 740, 742 (Ga. Ct. App. 1984)) should be controlling.Â  In the Ricks case, this court concluded that a defendantâ€™s belief that her insurance company was defending a complaint filed against her was sufficient for a showing of good cause to set aside an entry of default.Â  Id. at 373-5, 360 S.E.2d 536-7.Â  However, notwithstanding the Ricks case, the case law that the circuit court based its decision on is still good law and has not been overturned.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in refusing the set aside the entry of default.[2]Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; The second Pilgrim opinion was later vacated after the parties settled. Â \r\n[2]&nbsp; Because we affirm on the previous issue, we need not reach the additional issue of whether BFPEâ€™s Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default complied with Rules 6(d) and 7(b)(1) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  See \r\nFutch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (â€œ[A]n appellate court need not address remaining issues when disposition of prior issue is dispositive.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-092","title":"Mary Black Health System v.

Henderson and Joshua M. Henderson, of Spartanburg, for Appellant.\r\nJulie Jeffords Moose, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Philip Watterson appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment to Mary Black Health System, LLC, d/b/a Mary Black Memorial Hospital (Mary Black).Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn November 1998, Watterson and Mary Black entered into a contract entitled Physician Relocation Agreement (Agreement) in which Watterson agreed to relocate to the Spartanburg, South Carolina area in order to practice medicine in the field of Obstetrics and Gynecology (OB-GYN).Â  In the agreement Mary Black specifically stated that â€œ[Watterson] was recruited by [Mary Black] to fulfill a community need relating to the shortage of physicians in [Wattersonâ€™s] specialty in the community.â€Â Â Â  \r\nPursuant to the terms of the Agreement, Mary Black guaranteed that the cash collections for Wattersonâ€™s practice would be no less than $30,000.00 per month (the â€œGuarantee Amountâ€) during his first year of practice (the â€œGuarantee Periodâ€).Â  Mary Black was required to advance Watterson the Guarantee Amount for the initial month and continue advancing payments on or before the last day of each calendar month for one year. Â The amount of each payment was to be reduced by the total cash collections for the immediately proceeding month.Â  Watterson was obligated to pay back the advanced money after that first year.Â  However, the agreement also provided that at the end of the Guarantee Period, Mary Black would forgive and cancel one twenty-fourth of all amounts owed by Watterson for each calendar month he remained in the full-time practice of medicine in the Spartanburg area beyond the Guarantee Period.Â  Thus, if Watterson were to maintain his practice in the Spartanburg area for two years after the end of the Guarantee Period, the debt would be forgiven.Â Â Â  \r\nAfter moving to South Carolina, Watterson entered into practice with Dr. John Herbert in Spartanburg.Â  In the Guarantee Period, Watterson received $292,606.87 in cash collection guarantee payments from Mary Black and a loan intended to help him set up his practice.Â  During the same time period, Mary Black added five additional OB-GYNâ€™s to its list of physicians and began construction of a new building to be attached to Mary Black for the purpose of housing two groups of OB-GYNâ€™s.Â  Mary Black also purchased many of the family practice groups in the area from which Watterson had hoped to receive referrals.Â  Furthermore, Mary Black failed to list Wattersonâ€™s practice in the telephone directory for 1998-99 allegedly causing Watterson to lose out on potential clients.Â  \r\nFollowing the end of the first year of practice, Wattersonâ€™s partner decided to move his practice to a less expensive space.Â  Watterson was diagnosed with prostate cancer soon thereafter and was forced to resign.Â  Watterson terminated his Spartanburg practice in October of 1999.Â  After recovery, Watterson, contacted Mary Black, but was told no employment opportunities existed.Â  Watterson then moved from the Spartanburg area.Â Â Â  \r\nMary Black brought this action alleging it was owed the sum of $279,633.70 plus interest and attorneyâ€™s fees for the repayment of the cash collections guarantee and loan extended to Watterson.Â  Watterson filed his Answer and Set-Off/Counterclaim, alleging affirmative defenses of estoppel and waiver.Â  Mary Black filed its motion for summary judgment, which was decided without oral argument by order dated April 9, 2004.Â  The circuit court granted Mary Blackâ€™s motion for summary judgment and entered judgment against Watterson for $348,550.41.Â  Watterson made a motion to reconsider, which was subsequently denied.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, appellate courts apply the same standard that governs the circuit court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP, which states that summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Helms Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 340, 611 S.E.2d 485, 488 (2005). â€œIn determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€ Helms Realty, Inc., 363 S.C. at 340, 611 S.E.2d at 488.Â  Â â€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).Â  Summary judgment should be granted when plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ.Â  Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 518, 595 S.E.2d 817, 822 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Summary Judgment \r\nWatterson argues the circuit court erred in granting Mary Black summary judgment because its claims are barred by estoppel or waiver. Â \r\nInitially, Mary Black asserts Watterson has failed to preserve these issues for our review.Â  Mary Black contends that although Watterson pled the affirmative defenses of waiver and estoppel in his Answer, he failed to present such defenses to the circuit court and the circuit court did not rule on these issues.Â  Â Â \r\nWatterson raised the issues of estoppel and waiver in his answer. Â Thus, the issues were presented to the circuit court. While the circuit court did not specifically rule on these issues in its initial order, as Mary Blackâ€™s counsel acknowledged at oral argument, Watterson presented the issue of estoppel to the court in the Rule 59(e), SCRCP proceedings.Â  At the hearing for the Rule 59(e) motion, Watterson specifically argued the elements of estoppel and specifically mentioned estoppel giving Mary Black the opportunity to respond to the arguments.Â  We find the issue of estoppel is preserved for our review. See Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (stating when an issue presented to the trial court is not explicitly ruled on in the final order, the issue must be raised by an appropriate post-trial motion to be preserved for appeal).\r\nOn the other hand, Watterson failed to preserve the issue of waiver.Â  Watterson failed to argue waiver in both the application and the hearing for his Rule 59(e) motion.Â  In addition, though he raises the issue of waiver in his appellate brief, he fails to make a meaningful argument concerning this issue.Â  An issue which is not argued in the brief is deemed abandoned and precludes consideration on appeal. Â Fields v. Fields, 342 S.C. 182, 191 n.8, 536 S.E.2d 684, 689 n.8 (Ct. App. 2000) (stating that appellate court cannot reach issue where the appellant included issue in statement of issues on appeal but failed to argue issue in body of brief).Â  We find the issue of waiver is not properly before this court.Â  \r\nOn the merits, Watterson argues Mary Black should be estopped from collecting under the relocation agreement based on the representations they made at the time the agreement was signed.Â \r\nâ€œEstoppel arises when a party, relying upon what another has said or done, changes his position to his detriment.â€ Â Gibbs v. Kimbrell, 311 S.C. 261, 268, 428 S.E.2d 725, 729 (Ct. App. 1993). Â A claim of\r\nestoppel includes elements for the party asserting estoppel and the party estopped. Â Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Driver, 317 S.C. 471, 477, 451 S.E.2d 924, 928 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\nThe essential elements of equitable estoppel as related to the party estopped are: (1) conduct amounting to a false representation or concealment of material facts, or, at least, which is calculated to convey the impression that the facts are otherwise than, and inconsistent with, those which the party subsequently attempts to assert; (2) intention, or at least expectation, that such conduct shall be acted upon by the other party; and (3) knowledge, actual or constructive, of the real facts. Â S. Dev. Land &amp; Golf Co. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Auth., 311 S.C. 29, 33, 426 S.E.2d 748, 750 (1993).Â  As related to the party claiming the\r\nestoppel, they are: (1) lack of knowledge and of the means of knowledge of the truth as to the facts in question; (2) reliance on the conduct of the party estopped; and (3) a prejudicial change in position. Â Id.\r\nWe find no evidence in the record to support the first element of equitable estoppel as to the party estopped.Â  Watterson asserts Mary Black represented to him, in the Agreement and otherwise, that the Spartanburg community was â€œunderservedâ€ in the area of OB-GYN, that there was a â€œshortageâ€ of OB-GYN physicians and that there was a â€œcommunity needâ€ for Wattersonâ€™s services.Â Â  The record simply contains no evidence that any of these representations were false.Â  In addition, Watterson complains Mary Black concealed from him that it would be adding five new OB-GYN physicians and adding a new facility for these physicians and others. â€œEstoppel by silence arises where a person owing another a duty to speak refrains from doing so and thereby leads the other to believe in the existence of an erroneous state of facts.â€ Â S. Dev. Land &amp; Golf Co., 311 S.C. at 33, 426 S.E.2d at 751.Â  The duty to speak may arise from:Â  (1) a preexisting fiduciary relationship; (2) where in the particular transaction in question one party expressly reposes a trust and confidence in the other or where from the circumstances of the case, the nature of their dealings, or their position towards each other, such a trust and confidence in the particular case is necessarily implied; and â€œ(3) where the very contract or transaction itself, in its essential nature, is intrinsically fiduciary and necessarily calls for perfect good faith and full disclosure without regard to any particular intention of the parties.â€ Hedgepath v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 348 S.C. 340, 361, 559 S.E.2d 327, 339 (Ct. App. 2001).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nWe find no duty on the part of Mary Black to disclose this information to Watterson.Â  There was no fiduciary duty between the parties and the Agreement did not create one.Â  The Agreement did not contain any type of exclusivity clause.Â  Mary Black did not make any representations to Watterson that it would not hire additional physicians or that it would inform him if it did hire others.Â Â  \r\nAs Watterson failed to establish an essential element of equitable estoppel, we hold the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to Mary Black.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Calculation of Payments \r\nWatterson contends the circuit court erred in calculating the payments due under the physician relocation agreement. As he failed to raise this inaccuracy in the calculation to the trial court in his Rule 59, SCRCP, motion, the issue is not preserved for our review.Â  Padgett v. Mercado, 341 S.C. 229, 233, 533 S.E.2d 339, 341 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œAny argument alleging an inaccuracy or inconsistency in an order must be raised by a post-trial motion.â€).Â  Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the circuit courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN, CJ., and HUFF and STILWELL, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-093","title":"Walsh v.

West, of Columbia; for Appellant.\r\nPamela Michele Pearson, of Rock Hill; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Jodie Walsh (Mother) appeals a family court order resulting from an emergency custody hearing brought by Erik Walsh (Father). Â The family court ordered her not to remove the children from South Carolina pending resolution of custody issues.Â  Mother argues the family court lacked jurisdiction because the divorce took place in New York, and Mother and children had lived in South Carolina for approximately four months. Â We dismiss the appeal.\r\nFACTS\r\nFather and Mother married on July 6, 1991, and separated in April 1998.Â  The couple was divorced on November 17, 2002, by a New York court order.Â  The marriage produced three children, all of whom are minors.Â  New York orders dated July 18, 1998, and July 20, 1999, awarded Father and Mother joint custody, with Mother having physical custody.Â  \r\nOn October 21, 2005, Father filed a â€œComplaint For Setting Expedited Hearingâ€ seeking â€œemergency temporary custody of the minor children,â€\r\nÂ alleging that Mother left the minor children unattended on a regular basis and that he could provide a stable home for the children.Â  Father also stated the parties had relocated to South Carolina in July of 2005, and that Mother had told him she planned to move back to New York with the children on October 28, 2005.Â Â  Â \r\nFollowing a hearing, the family court issued an Â order, dated November 27, 2005, assuming jurisdiction of the matter on the grounds that Father resided in North Carolina, Mother resided in South Carolina, and becauseÂ  Â substantial evidence no longer existed in New York regarding the children. Â The court ordered that the children should remain in Motherâ€™s custody and could not leave South Carolina except when visiting Father in North Carolina.Â  The family court also appointed a guardian ad litem to represent the interests of the children and granted the parties the right to engage in discovery.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMother argues the family court erred in assuming jurisdiction of this case under both the South Carolinaâ€™s Uniform Child Custody Act and under the federal Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act.Â  We decline to address these issues because we hold the underlying order is interlocutory and hence not immediately\r\nappealable.\r\nAbsent some specialized statute, the immediate appealability of an interlocutory or intermediate order depends on whether the order falls within section 14-3-330 of the South Carolina Code.Â  SeeÂ  Baldwin Construction Co., Inc. v. Graham, 357 S.C. 227, 230, 593 S.E.2d 146, 147 (2004).Â  Interlocutory orders affecting a substantial right may be immediately appealed if they discontinue an action, prevent an appeal, grant or refuse a new trial, or strike out an action or defense.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(2) (1976); Edwards v. Suncom, 369 S.C. 91, 94, 631 S.E.2d 529, 531 (2006).Â  \r\nBy its very terms, the order under appeal is not final.Â  Indeed, the family court judge stated at the hearing that she was acting on â€œan expedited emergency basis.â€Â  The judge specifically invited the parties to â€œfile for a temporary action (sic) and get all these other issues settled but right now the children are not leaving the this state and a guardian will be appointed.â€\r\nMother argues this court recently held that â€œ[m]atters involving the custody of oneâ€™s child certainly constitute a â€˜substantial right.â€™â€Â  Widdicombe v. P. Tucker-Cales, 366 S.C 75, 85, 620 S.E.2d 333, 338 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  This case is unlike Widdicombe, a case limited to its peculiar facts and procedural posture.[1]Â  Nothing makes the family courtâ€™s order in this case effectively final.Â  South Carolina law clearly holds that an order denying a challenge to the trial courtâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction is interlocutory and not immediately appealable.Â  Deskins v. Boltin, 319 S.C. 356, 357 461 S.E.2d 395, 396 (1995).Â  Therefore this order is not presently appealable under section 14-3-330 of the South Carolina Code (1976).\r\nFor the reasons stated above, we find the family courtâ€™s order is not appealable, and therefore decline to address Motherâ€™s jurisdiction arguments.Â  \r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] In Widdicombe, a temporary order reversing custody had been stricken from the active roster for over three years, and the appellantâ€™s motion for relief from judgment in the family court had been denied as interlocutory and past the statute of limitations, but the family court had reaffirmed its subject matter jurisdiction.Â  The Court of Appeals found the family courtâ€™s orders thus had the practical effect of a final order affecting the appellantâ€™s substantial rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-094","title":"SCDSS v.

Warner, of Columbia; for Appellant.\r\n        John S. Nichols, of Columbia; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Joann B. Whitlock (Wife) appeals the family courtâ€™s order finding John W. Whitlock (Husband) did not violate the terms of the Pendente Lite Consent Order, the Final Order, and the Decree of Divorce.Â Â  Wife contends the family court erred in: Â (1) modifying the orders as it lacked jurisdiction to do so; (2) finding the previous family court had not addressed issues of taxation in the Final Decree; (3) failing to hold Husband in contempt; (4) delegating to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) the power to determine the deductibility of court-ordered alimony; and (5) failing to award attorneyâ€™s fees, costs, and accountant fees.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThe parties were married on February 9, 1964, in the state of Georgia.Â Â  The couple had two children.Â  In June 1999, Husband became involved in an adulterous relationship which resulted in the partiesâ€™ separation.Â  On June 24, 1999, Wife filed for divorce on the ground of adultery.Â  Husband filed an Answer and Counterclaim on August 17, 1999. Â Wife filed an Amended Reply to the Answer and Counterclaim on October 27, 1999.Â  Â Â \r\nThe family court (Judge Riddle) entered a Pendente Lite Consent Order on July 9, 1999. Â In pertinent part, the Pendente Lite Consent Order provided:Â  \r\n\r\n  Defendant-Husband shall pay directly to Plaintiff-Wife the sum of $1,858.65 per month as temporary alimony commencing and effective July 1, 1999 pending further agreement or order.Â  From that alimony, and with her own earnings from her employment, Plaintiff-Wife shall pay the expenses detailed on her Financial Declaration Budget Form (copy attached), except the health insurance which shall be provided and paid for by Defendant-Husband.Â  If extraordinary expenses arise, they shall be dealt with by supplemental agreement or order.Â  The payment of this pendente lite alimony is without prejudice on the merits and shall have no tax consequences to Plaintiff-Wife, pendente lite.Â  The trial judge may, however, reallocate tax consequences at the final hearing.Â  \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).Â Â Â  \r\nA final hearing was held before the family court (Judge Edwards) on March 19 and 20, 2001, and April 23, 2001.Â  Judge Edwards issued a Final Order and Decree of Divorce on December 5, 2001.Â  The Final Order provided that the Pendente Lite Consent Order should remain in effect through and including December 2001.Â  The terms of the Final Order awarded Wife $2,200.00 permanent periodic alimony, taxable to Wife and deductible to Husband for tax purposes, commencing the date of the order.Â  Â Â Neither party moved for reconsideration of the Final Order, nor did either party appeal from the Final Order. Â \r\nIn the first year after the parties separated, they filed joint tax returns.Â Â Â  In the years after, the parties filed separately.Â  Some time in 2003, Wife was contacted by the IRS concerning her tax liability for the year 2000.Â  She was told she owed the IRS $4,887.06 based on the temporary alimony paid to her by Husband.Â  Wife immediately contacted Husband about the letter and he told her he would contact the IRS to â€œask their advice.â€Â  Wife hired an accountant to advise her in the matter.Â  \r\nOn August 1, 2004, Wife moved for an Order and Rule to Show Cause why Husband should not be held in contempt for failing to comply with the Pendente Lite Consent Order by refusing to abide by the taxation allocation thereunder for the 2000 tax year.Â  On October 13, 2004, Husband offered to settle the case by paying the $4,887.06 owed by Wife to the IRS.Â  On October 14, 2004, the family court (Judge Morehead) held a hearing and on March 14, 2005, issued an order.Â  Judge Morehead ruled Husband was not in willful contempt and denied Wifeâ€™s claim for relief.Â  Specifically, he found the following:Â  \r\n\r\n  I find [Husband] to be a credible person, and [he] has not willfully violated the court order.Â  I further find this court cannot require [Husband] to pay the amount [Wife] paid to the IRS or the CPA fees she incurred or the legal fees and costs she has incurred.Â  Judge Edwardâ€™s [sic] order did not address the pendente lite deductibility or non-deductibility of the temporary alimony.Â  Judge Edwardâ€™s [sic] order required that permanent periodic alimony would begin on January, 2002 and be taxable to [Wife] and deductible to [Husband], but the order is silent as to the Pendente Lite Consent Order as it relates to the treatment of the temporary alimony.Â  The Pendente Lite Consent Order states that the pendente lite alimony may be reallocated at the final hearing.Â  Judge Edwards determined the deductibility and taxability of the permanent periodic alimony, but the court did not address the prior Pendente Lite Consent Order of the parties as it dealt with temporary alimony.Â  \r\n\r\nWife timely moved pursuant to Rules 52, 59, and 60, SCRCP, and Rule 2(a), SCRFC, for reconsideration of the order.Â  Wife filed this appeal after Judge Morehead denied her motion. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family court, the appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 328, 526 S.E.2d 241, 244-45 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\nHowever, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Nor must we ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Lacke v. Lacke, 362 S.C. 302, 307, 608 S.E.2d 147, 150 (Ct. App. 2005); see also Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996) (noting that because the appellate court lacks the opportunity for direct observation of witnesses, it should accord great deference to the family courtâ€™s findings where matters of credibility are involved).Â  Our broad scope of review does not relieve appellant of her burden to convince this court that the family court committed error.Â  Skinner v. King, 272 S.C. 520, 522-23, 252 S.E.2d 891, 892 (1979).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nWife contends Judge Morehead erroneously modified Judge Riddleâ€™s unappealed Pendente Lite Consent Order and Judge Edwardsâ€™ Final Order entered in this case.Â  Specifically, Wife asserts Judge Moreheadâ€™s authority was limited to enforcement of these orders and, thus, he was without jurisdiction to modify them.Â  We disagree.Â  Â Â \r\nWe believe Wifeâ€™s arguments mischaracterize Judge Moreheadâ€™s rulings.Â  Judge Morehead did not change the terms of the prior orders.Â  Instead, he properly exercised his authority when he read the language of the orders in question, took testimony on the issues, and ultimately employed rules of construction to interpret the language of the two prior family court orders.Â  See Emery v. Smith, 361 S.C. 207, 214, 603 S.E.2d 598, 601-02 (Ct. App. 2004) (stating agreement which becomes part of family courtâ€™s order is â€œfully subject to the family courtâ€™s authority to interpret and enforce its own decreesâ€); see also Covington v. Covington, 306 S.C. 473, 475, 412 S.E.2d 455, 456 (Ct. App. 1991) (holding judgments are to be construed like other written instruments).Â  Accordingly, we find no merit to Wifeâ€™s argument that Judge Morehead improperly modified the orders at issue in this case.\r\nII.\r\nWife argues Judge Morehead erred in finding that Judge Edwards failed to address the temporary alimony taxation issues in the Final Order.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nIn his order, Judge Morehead found that â€œJudge Edwardâ€™s [sic] order did not address the pendente lite deductibility or non-deductibility of the temporary alimony.â€Â  However, this finding was in error as the Final Order clearly provided that â€œThe Pendente Lite Consent Order issued on July 7, 1999 shall remain in effect through and including the calendar month in which this decree is issued.â€Â  Although the Pendente Lite Consent Order stated that â€œ[t]he trial judge may, however, reallocate tax consequences at the final hearing,â€ the family court failed to do so.Â  The Pendente Lite Consent Order provided that â€œ[t]he payment of this pendente lite alimony is without prejudice on the merits and shall have no tax consequences to Plaintiff-Wife, pendente lite.â€Â  Â Â \r\nThe orders at issue were clear and unambiguous.Â  If the language employed is plain and unambiguous, there is no room for construction or interpretation, and the effect thereof must be declared in the light of the literal meaning of the language used.Â  Stanaland v. Jamison, 275 S.C. 50, 53, 263 S.E.2d 578, 579 (1980) (noting family court has the duty â€œto construe a contract which is subject to more than one interpretation, but when the terms of a contract are clear, there is no room for interpretation and the parties must live with the agreement which was madeâ€); In re White, 299 S.C. 406, 412, 385 S.E.2d 211, 215 (Ct. App. 1989) (recognizing in family court action involving child support that judgments are to be construed like other written instruments).Â  Therefore, the orders are to be read in the light of their literal meaning.Â  \r\nBecause the Final Order did nothing but continue the tax consequences outlined for the temporary alimony in the Pendente Lite Consent Order, the Pendente Lite Consent Order was still controlling and the temporary alimony should have had no tax consequences for Wife.Â  Construing the orders in this way, Husband violated the Pendente Lite Consent Order when he filed his taxes for the year 2000 which resulted in tax consequences for Wife.Â  Thus, Judge Morehead erroneously interpreted the Final Order in stating that the order did not address the temporary alimony tax issues.Â  In light of our decision, we hold Wife is entitled to reimbursement in the amount of $4,887.06, for her payment to the IRS pertaining to the temporary alimony payments.Â  \r\nIII.\r\nWife asserts Judge Morehead erred in failing to hold Husband in contempt for violating the terms of the Pendente Lite Consent Order, the Final Order, and the Decree of Divorce. Â We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe power to punish for contempt is inherent in all courts and is essential to preservation of order in judicial proceedings.â€ Â In re Brown, 333 S.C. 414, 420, 511 S.E.2d 351, 355 (1998).Â  Contempt results from a partyâ€™s willful disobedience of a court order.Â  Â Smith v. Smith, 359 S.C. 393, 396, 597 S.E.2d 188, 189 (Ct. App. 2004); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1350 (Supp. 2006) (A party may be found in contempt of court for the willful violation of a lawful court order.). Â â€œA willful act is one which is â€˜done voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done; that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.â€™â€ Widman v. Widman, 348 S.C. 97, 119, 557 S.E.2d 693, 705 (Ct. App. 2001) (quoting Spartanburg County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1988)). â€œ[B]efore a court may find a person in contempt, the record must clearly and specifically reflect the contemptuous conduct.â€ Widman, 348 S.C. at 119, 557 S.E.2d at 705.\r\nâ€œIn a proceeding for contempt for violation of a court order, the moving party must show the existence of a court order and the facts establishing the respondentâ€™s noncompliance with the order.â€Â  Hawkins v. Mullins, 359 S.C. 497, 501, 597 S.E.2d 897, 899 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œOnce the moving party has made out a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the respondent to establish his or her defense and inability to comply with the order.â€Â  Widman, 348 S.C. at 120, 557 S.E.2d at 705.Â  Furthermore, â€œ[i]t is generally recognized that where a contemnor is unable, without fault on his part, to obey an order of the court, he is not to be held in contempt.â€Â  Hicks v. Hicks, 280 S.C. 378, 381, 312 S.E.2d 598, 599 (Ct. App. 1984). \r\nA finding of contempt rests within the sound discretion of the court and results from willful disobedience of a court order.Â  Henderson v. Henderson, 298 S.C. 190, 197, 379 S.E.2d 125, 129 (1989).Â  â€œA trial courtâ€™s determination regarding contempt is subject to reversal where it is based on findings that are without evidentiary support or where there has been an abuse of discretion.â€ Henderson v. Puckett, 316 S.C. 171, 173, 447 S.E.2d 871, 872 (Ct. App. 1994). â€œEven though a party is found to have violated a court order, the question of whether or not to impose sanctions remains a matter for the courtâ€™s discretion.â€ Hawkins v. Mullins, 359 S.C. 497, 503, 597 S.E.2d 897, 900 (Ct. App. 2004). â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs either when the court is controlled by some error of law or where the order, based upon findings of fact, lacks evidentiary support.â€ Townsend v. Townsend, 356 S.C. 70, 73, 587 S.E.2d 118, 119 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nHere, Husbandâ€™s actions were not done with the requisite willfulness which requires the act be â€œâ€˜done voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done; that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.â€™â€ Widman, 348 S.C. at 119, 557 S.E.2d at 705 (quoting Spartanburg County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1988)).Â  Regardless of the fact that we have interpreted the orders to be construed in a manner against Husband, there is still no evidence of contempt on his part.Â  Therefore, we hold Judge Morehead did not abuse his discretion in declining to find Husband in contempt for violating the terms of the Pendente Lite Consent Order, the Final Order, and the Decree of Divorce.\r\nIV.\r\nWife claims Judge Morehead erred in finding the IRS, not the family court, should make the determination of the deductibility of the court-ordered alimony as the family court lacked jurisdiction to delegate the issue of payments to the IRS.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn his order, Judge Morehead stated: \r\n\r\n  I find the issue of tax consequences on the pendente lite alimony is an issue between Plaintiff and the IRS.Â  I further find Defendant is not required to pay the taxes on the pendente lite alimony and is not required to pay the CPA fees of Plaintiff or attorney fees and costs of Plaintiff.Â  \r\n\r\nA clear reading of this order shows that this finding was based on Judge Moreheadâ€™s earlier finding in the same order that Husband was not liable to Wife for the payment of taxes.Â  This did not, as Wife claims, give the IRS the power to adjudicate this issue.Â  Rather, Judge Morehead was merely stating that Wifeâ€™s only avenue for recovery would now be through the IRS.Â  Accordingly, we find Judge Morehead did not improperly delegate its powers to the IRS.Â  \r\nV.\r\nWife argues Judge Morehead erred in declining to award her attorneyâ€™s fees, costs, and accountant fees based on Husbandâ€™s violation of the court orders and refusal to correct the error.Â  We agree in part.Â  \r\nâ€œAn award of attorneysâ€™ fees and costs is a discretionary matter not to be overturned absent abuse by the trial court.â€ Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 365, 384 S.E.2d 741, 748 (1989).Â  In determining whether attorneyâ€™s fees should be awarded, the court should consider the following factors:Â  the partyâ€™s ability to pay his/her own attorneyâ€™s fees; beneficial results obtained by the attorney; the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions; and the effect of the attorneyâ€™s fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M, 307 S.C. 471, 477-78, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  In determining the reasonable amount of attorneyâ€™s fees to award, the family court should consider the nature, extent and difficulty of the services rendered, the time necessarily devoted to the case, counselâ€™s professional standing, the contingency of compensation, the beneficial results obtained, and the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991). Â â€œThe same considerations that apply to awarding attorneyâ€™s fees apply to awarding litigation expenses.â€Â  Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 533, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004).\r\nBased on our finding that Judge Edwards addressed the temporary alimony tax at issue in the Final Order and Wife is entitled to a reimbursement of the $4,887.06 paid to the IRS, we hold Wife is also entitled to an award of attorneyâ€™s fees, costs, and accountant fees.Â  Because Husband tried to settle the case on October 13, 2004, by offering to pay $4,887.06 to Wife for the tax liability, we hold Wifeâ€™s recovery of these fees is limited only to those incurred up to the date of the hearing, October 14, 2004.Â  Â Â Additionally, this only includes attorneyâ€™s fees, costs, and accountant fees accrued in the course of Wife pursuing the payment of the pendente lite taxes at issue in this case.Â  In the Final Order and Decree of Divorce Wife was awarded $25,000.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Nothing in this opinion should be construed as changing that ruling.Â  We emphasize that Wife is only to receive attorneyâ€™s fees, costs, and accountant fees associated with the issues discussed in the instant case up to the date of the hearing.Â  Accordingly, we remand to the family court for a determination of the amount to be awarded.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the family court improperly held that the temporary alimony tax issue was not addressed in the Final Order and found Husband was not liable for the tax liability for that alimony.Â  We also hold Wife is entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees, costs, and accountant fees incurred up until the date of the hearing, October 14, 2004.Â  We remand to the family court to determine an amount of attorneyâ€™s fees, costs, and accountant fees to be awarded consistent with the holding of this opinion.Â  All other issues are affirmed.Â  For the reasons stated herein, the family courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.Â  \r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and BEATTY, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-096","title":"Brighton Woods Homeownerâ€™s Association v.

Derham Cole, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-096\r\nSubmitted February 1, 2007 â€“ Filed February 23, 2007\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        William Duncan Fore, of Greenville, for Appellant.Â  \r\n        Shane W. Rogers and Kristin Burnett Barber, both of Spartanburg, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Brighton Woods Homeownerâ€™s Association, Inc. appeals the grant of summary judgment to The Ryland Group.Â  We reverse and remand.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1997, Four Seventeen, Inc. began development of the residential subdivision Brighton Woods.Â  Four Seventeen drafted a set of covenants and restrictions to govern the use of property in the subdivision and to control the operation of the Brighton Woods Homeownerâ€™s Association, which was created by the documents.Â  Amended covenants[2] were filed with the register of deeds in October of 1997. Â The board of directors was responsible for setting the annual assessments.Â  Until 2000, Four Seventeen acted as the de facto board of directors for the association.Â  \r\nThereafter, The Ryland Group entered into an agreement to purchase a number of lots in the subdivision and began constructing houses thereon.Â  By agreement, Four Seventeen did not levy assessments against Ryland.Â  In 2000, property owners in the subdivision took control of the association.Â  The association levied assessments against Ryland, and Ryland refused to pay claiming that it was not required to pay such fees under its agreement with Four Seventeen.Â  The association sued Ryland and Four Seventeen for back due assessments.Â  The trial court granted Rylandâ€™s motion for summary judgment on the ground that the covenants required a meeting of all property owners to set the annual assessments and since such a meeting was not conducted, the assessments were improperly made.Â  Consequently, Ryland could not be held liable for them.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  â€œSummary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.â€Â  Gadson v. Hembree, 364 S.C. 316, 320, 613 S.E.2d 533, 535 (2005).Â  \r\nANALYSIS\r\nA reading of the covenants leads us to disagree with the trial courtâ€™s interpretation of its provisions.Â  Article III, Section 3 provides:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    a.\r\n    [T]he maximum annual assessment may be increased each year not more than ten (10%) percent above the maximum assessment for the previous year without a vote of the membership.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    b.\r\n    [T]he maximum annual assessment may be increased above ten (10%) percent by a vote of two-thirds (2/3) of each class of members who are voting in person or by proxy, at a meeting duly called for this purpose.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    c.&nbsp;\r\n    The Board of Directors may fix the annual assessment at an amount not in excess of the maximum. &nbsp;\r\n  \r\n\r\nSection 4 of Article III allows the board to levy a special assessment â€œprovided that any such assessment shall have the consent of two-thirds (2/3) of the votes of each class of members who are voting in person or by proxy at a meeting duly called for this purpose.â€Â  These provisions clearly indicate a vote of the membership is required for increases of more than 10% or for â€œspecial assessments.â€Â  \r\nArticle III, Section 5 is entitled â€œNotice and Quorum for Any Action Authorized Under Sections 3 and 4.â€Â  It states:Â  â€œWritten notice of any meeting called for the purpose of taking any action authorized under Section 3 or 4 shall be sent to all members not less than thirty (30) days nor more than sixty (60) days in advance of the meeting.â€ Â Section 7 provides that the board of directors â€œshall fix the amount of the annual assessment against each Lot at least thirty (30) days in advance of each annual assessment period,â€ and â€œ[w]ritten notice of that annual assessment shall be sent to every Owner subject thereto.â€Â  The trial court concluded that when Article III, Section 3 is read in conjunction with Article III, Sections 5 and 7, the covenants require a meeting of the membership to approve any assessment.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nEven though Section 5 references â€œany action authorized under sections 3 and 4,â€ the only actions authorized under Sections 3 and 4 that require meetings of the membership are special assessments and increases greater than 10%.Â  Section 5 provides the framework by which a meeting must be noticed and conducted, and Section 7 prescribes how and when members are to be notified of the annual assessment.Â  There appears to be a distinction between acts that require a meeting of the board and acts that require a meeting of the associationâ€™s membership. Â Although Article III could have been written more clearly, a plain reading of all the provisions does not lead to the conclusion that the determination of all annual assessments requires a meeting of the membership.\r\n After examining the record, there appears to be a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the association complied with the mandates set forth in Article III, Section 7 of the covenants.Â  From the record before us, we cannot ascertain with certainty the amount of the annual assessment, whether the board set that amount by meeting or otherwise, or if Ryland received the required notice in the prescribed time period.Â  \r\nBecause we disagree with the trial courtâ€™s conclusion that the provisions of the covenants require a meeting of the members of the association to set the assessments, we reverse that portion of the order.Â  However, having concluded that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding the associationâ€™s compliance with Article III, Section 7 of the covenants, we remand for further proceedings.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] â€œFirst Amendment to Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions for a Residential Subdivision Known as Brighton Woods.â€Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-097","title":"Charleston County Department of Social Services v.

Segars-Andrews, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-097\r\nSubmitted February 1, 2007 â€“ Filed February 23, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        George E. Counts and Kelvin M. Huger, both of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\n        Frampton Durban, of North Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n        Nancy Chiles, of Charleston, Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Mother appeals the family courtâ€™s permanency planning order, which instructed the Charleston County Department of Social Services (DSS) to institute the termination of parental rights (TPR) with respect to one of her minor children and to award custody of two of her other minor children to their respective fathers.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nMother has four biological children: (1) Tevin M., born August 5, 1992; (2) J.T., born February 16, 1995; (3) D.M., born September 10, 1998; and (4) Trevon M., born January 9, 2002.Â  Until 2003, when Mother gave custody of J.T. to his father, she was the sole custodial parent and caregiver to all four children.Â  \r\nOn November 5, 2003, Mother spanked then five-year-old D.M., leaving marks and bruises on her back and legs.Â  As a result, DSS removed the children from Motherâ€™s custody.Â  D.M. has consistently maintained that Mother spanked her with the cord of an electric iron.Â  Mother has maintained she spanked D.M. with a belt but has admitted she struck her too hard.Â  Dr. Sarah Schuh, an expert in child abuse, testified that D.M.â€™s injuries were consistent with being struck by an electric power cord rather than by a belt.\r\nIn November 2003, DSS placed the children with Motherâ€™s sister, Pamela N., with instructions that the children not be allowed any contact with Mother.Â  In April 2004, DSS removed the children from Pamela N.â€™s care and took them into custody because according to DSS, Pamela N. allowed Mother to see the children on a regular basis and talk on the telephone with them once a week.Â  \r\nOn June 17, 2004, the family court held a merits hearing. Â At the hearing, Mother consented to a finding that she abused the children. Â The family court ordered D.M. and Trevon M. to remain in the custody of Charleston County DSS.Â  The family court further ordered that Charleston County DSS would have temporary legal custody of Tevin M., but Chris R., Tevin M.â€™s father, would have temporary physical custody.Â  Additionally, the family court ordered Mother to participate in family therapy with D.M. and Tevin M. and to follow the therapistâ€™s recommendations.Â  \r\nAs required by the June 2004 order, the family court held a judicial review hearing on July 29, 2004.Â  The family court ordered Jacob J., Trevon M.â€™s father, to undergo a substance abuse evaluation.Â  It further ordered Mother to continue attending counseling and to complete abuse clarification with the children.Â  \r\nIn June 2004, Tevin M. relocated to Kentucky with his father.Â  The guardian ad litem (GAL) received reports from Kentucky on Tevin M.â€™s placement and spoke to Chris R. about how Tevin M. was doing in his care.Â  In addition, the GAL learned that Trevon M. and his father did not have a close relationship and that Jacob J. had a substance abuse problem. Â Further, Jacob J. failed to follow the court ordered treatment plan.Â  \r\nD.M. did not learn the true identity of her biological father until December 2004 when DSS identified Telly L. as D.M.â€™s father. Â Telly L. was absent since D.M.â€™s infancy; however, Telly L. and D.M. underwent counseling to help reestablish their parent-child relationship. Â The GAL conducted home visits with Telly L. and observed him with D.M. in therapy sessions.Â  The GAL found Telly L. to be committed to D.M.Â  Both the GAL and the DSS caseworker recommended that he receive custody.\r\nThe family court held another judicial review hearing regarding the childrenâ€™s placement on December 16, 2004. Â The family court determined that legal and physical custody of D.M. and Trevon M. should remain with DSS and temporary legal and physical custody of Tevin M. should remain with Chris R.Â  The family court ordered: (1) Jacob J. to successfully complete a drug and alcohol treatment program; (2) Mother to successfully complete parent effectiveness training and family counseling with D.M. and Trevon M. and to cooperate with Tevin M.â€™s therapist; and (3) Telly L. to successfully complete family counseling with D.M.Â  The family court ordered a permanency planning hearing to be scheduled for February 17, 2005.Â  \r\nBy agreement between the parties, Mother paid child support to Jevelous T. for J.T.Â  Mother fell behind in her support payments.Â  She was found in contempt of court and was placed in jail for one day.Â  Upon her release on December 14, 2005, Mother called Jevelous T. and left him a message saying in part, â€œI am going to get you.Â  You better believe that.â€Â  Mother testified that she was angry with him, but she did not actually intend to harm him.Â  \r\nOn January 10, 2006, Mother mistakenly believed she had a therapy session with her therapist, Joyce Ewell.Â  Because Ewell was with another client, Ewell could not see Mother. Â The receptionist had to call Ewell to the front desk because Mother became increasingly upset. Â Mother testified she was upset because she saw D.M. only at therapy sessions; however, Mother eventually left Ewellâ€™s office. \r\nThe family court held the permanency planning hearing on January 19-20 and March 10, 2006.Â  The court awarded Telly L. legal and physical custody of D.M. and awarded Chris R. legal and physical custody of Tevin M.Â  The family court instructed DSS to initiate a TPR action for Trevon M. who was to remain in the custody of DSS.Â  Further, the family court ordered Mother and D.M. to continue and successfully complete family counseling and for Mother to have visitation with D.M., if approved by D.M.â€™s therapist, DSS, and the GAL.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from a family court order, this Court has authority to correct errors of law and find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 473, 415 S.E.2d 812, 814 (1992).Â  However, the family court is in a superior position to judge the witnessesâ€™ demeanor and veracity, and consequently, we give its findings broad discretion.Â  Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003).Â  This degree of deference is especially true in cases involving the welfare and best interests of a minor child.Â  Ex parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 62, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652 (2006). Â When the evidence is conflicting and susceptible of different inferences, the family court has the duty of determining not only the law of the case, but the facts as well, because it had the benefit of observing the witnesses and determining how much credence to give each oneâ€™s testimony.Â  Anders v. Anders, 285 S.C. 512, 514, 331 S.E.2d 340, 341 (1985); see also Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996) (holding when evidence is disputed, the appellate court may adhere to the family courtâ€™s findings).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Change of Custody and Initiation of TPR\r\nMother argues the family court erred when it ordered a change in custody for D.M. and Tevin M. and permitted DSS to commence TPR with respect to Trevon M. because Mother was making solid progress towards reunification with her children.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen a child is placed in foster care, the family court is required to conduct a permanency planning hearing within a year of the childâ€™s placement in foster care. Â S.C. Code Ann Â§ 20-7-766(A) (Supp. 2005). Â At this hearing, the family court must approve a placement plan for the child, which typically entails three options: reunification with the parents, custody or guardianship with a fit and willing relative, or termination of parental rights.Â  See Â§ 20-7-766(C).Â  If the family court approves a different plan, it must find compelling reasons to do so, and the plan must be in the childâ€™s best interests.Â  Id.Â  \r\nGenerally, if the court determines the child should not be returned to the childâ€™s parents, DSS must file a petition to terminate parental rights within sixty days of the family courtâ€™s order.Â  Â§ 20-7-766(E).Â  However, if the child is not returned to the parents, but termination of parental rights is not in the childâ€™s best interests, the family court â€œmay award custody or legal guardianship, or both, to a suitable, fit, and willing relative or nonrelative.â€ Â Â§Â§ 20-7-766(E), 20-7-766(G).Â  Consequently, DSS is not required to file a petition to terminate parental rights at that time.Â  Id.\r\nAdditionally, if the family court cannot safely return the child to the childâ€™s parents, but there is a possibility the child may be safely returned within a reasonable time, not to exceed eighteen months, the family court can order an extension of the placement plan or may modify the plan.Â  See Â§ 20-7-766(F). Â However, â€œ[b]efore continuing foster care for this purpose, the court must find that, at the time of the hearing, initiation of termination of parental rights is not in the best interests of the child and that the best interests of the child will be served by the extended or modified plan.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nAs set forth in section 20-7-766(C), the family court had only one viable option for D.M. and Tevin M. as well as only one available option for Trevon M.Â  Reuniting the children with Mother was not an alternative because Mother still had not resolved her anger problems that led to the removal of her children.Â  The next possible placement for the children was with their respective fathers if they were fit.Â  For D.M. and Tevin M., their fathers were available and found to be fit and suitable parents.Â  Trevon M.â€™s father was determined not to be an appropriate placement because of substance abuse problems.Â  \r\nThe family court considered other relatives for placement of Trevon M.Â  Motherâ€™s sister, Pamela N., was unsuitable because the children had already been removed from her care.Â  Another of Motherâ€™s sisters, Carolyn M., and her husband, Curtis, failed to comply with earlier family court orders relating to the supervision, safety, and well-being of J.T.Â  The couple was to supervise Mother with J.T. during his court ordered visitation, but they allowed Mother to be alone with him.Â  Therefore, based on the circumstances, the family courtâ€™s only remaining option for Trevon M. was to begin TPR.Â  \r\nThe State argues that according to section 20-7-766(F), a child cannot be returned to the childâ€™s parents if the child has been in foster care for over eighteen months. Â Because the permanency planning hearing occurred after Trevon M. was in foster care for twenty-two months, DSS was required by law to institute a termination of parental rights action. Â Here, the letter of the law was satisfied once Trevon M. remained in foster care greater than eighteen months.[2]Â  \r\nAlthough, â€œ[t]he public policy of this [S]tate in child custody matters is to reunite parents and children,â€ we have long decided all matters involving the custody or care of children in â€œlight of the fundamental principle that the controlling consideration is the best interests of the child.â€Â  Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 295-96, 513 S.E.2d 358, 366 (1999) (internal quotations omitted). Â In recent years, the Legislature has placed an increasing emphasis on the best interests of the child in abuse and neglect cases.Â  Id. at 295, 513 S.E.2d at 366.Â  \r\nEven if we disregarded section 20-7-766(F), the childrenâ€™s best interests would not be served by returning them to Mother because she still has not resolved her anger management problems.Â  Although Mother is following the treatment plan, she has not completed it.Â  D.M.â€™s and Tevin M.â€™s best interests are served by giving their respective fathers custody.Â  The family court found that both fathers were fit parents and were capable of providing suitable homes.Â  Returning Trevon M. to his father would not be in his best interests because of his fatherâ€™s substance abuse problem, and no other relatives were found to be suitable.Â  Therefore, TPR is the appropriate plan and in Trevon M.â€™s best interests.\r\nII. The GALâ€™s Recommendation \r\nNext, Mother contends the GALâ€™s recommendation was flawed.Â  She maintains the recommendation was biased and based on an incomplete investigation of the case.Â  We disagree. \r\nSection 20-7-122 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) provides the responsibilities and duties for a GAL appointed in abuse and neglect cases: \r\n\r\n  \r\n    (1) represent the best interests of the child;\r\n  (2) advocate for the welfare and rights of a child involved in an abuse or neglect proceeding;\r\n  (3) conduct an independent assessment of the facts, the needs of the child, and the available resources within the family and community to meet those needs;\r\n  (4) maintain accurate, written case records;\r\n  (5) provide the family court with a written report, consistent with the rules of evidence and the rules of the court, which includes without limitation evaluation and assessment of the issues brought before the court and recommendations for the case plan, the wishes of the child, if appropriate, and subsequent disposition of the case;\r\n  (6) monitor compliance with the orders of the family court and to make the motions necessary to enforce the orders of the court or seek judicial review;\r\n  (7) protect and promote the best interests of the child until formally relieved of the responsibility by the family court.\r\n\r\nIn an abuse situation, the GAL is to serve as the childâ€™s advocate and to do what is in the best interests of the child.Â  In both situations, the GALâ€™s primary concern is the best interests of the children.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-122(1), 20-7-1549(A)(1) (Supp. 2005).Â  \r\nIn the present case, the GAL followed her statutory responsibilities and duties.Â  She did not have any statutory duty to perform a home visit with Mother simply because she performed visits with one of the fathers.Â  Because the children had never lived with their fathers, it was important to observe the fathersâ€™ living situations to assess if they were suitable guardians.Â  The GALâ€™s opinion that Mother was not a suitable parent arose out of Motherâ€™s unresolved anger problems, not the physical condition of the home.Â  Because she had not resolved those problems, a home visit would not have assuaged the GALâ€™s concerns.Â  The GAL properly observed Mother with the children during therapy sessions.Â  Therefore, the GALâ€™s report was not biased or incomplete.\r\nFurther, the family court did not rely solely on the GALâ€™s report. Â It considered the testimony, the case record, the supplemental report submitted by DSS, and the recommendations of the GAL in determining the permanency plan for Trevon M.Â  Therefore, even if the report was biased, we discern no prejudice because the record contains other ample evidence to support the findings of the family court.\r\nIII. Family Courtâ€™s Reliance on Incidents Before Hearing\r\nFinally, Mother maintains the family court erred by placing too much emphasis on two incidents occurring shortly before the hearing, namely the answering machine message and the incident at the therapistâ€™s office.Â  Mother contends the GALâ€™s recommendation changed after the two incidents, proving the family court relied too heavily on the incidents.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe family court considered the testimony, case record, the supplemental report submitted by DSS, and the recommendations of the GAL in determining the permanency plan for Trevon M.Â  Even if we excluded these two incidents, based on our own review of the evidence, we find Mother has not resolved her anger management issues, which contributed to causing serious injury to one of the children and led to the childrenâ€™s removal. Â Thus, returning the children to Mother at this time would be inappropriate.\r\nAccordingly, the family courtâ€™s order is \r\nAFFIRMED.[3]\r\nHUFF, BEATTY, AND WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The names of the minor children and the respective defendants have been changed to protect the minorsâ€™ identities.\r\n[2] Â We note that although the letter of the law was satisfied in the present case, some instances exist when this statutory ground would not support termination of parental rights despite the childâ€™s presence in foster care for eighteen months. Cf. Charleston County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Jackson, 368 S.C. 87, 102 n. 8, 627 S.E.2d 765, 773 n.8 (Ct. App. 2006) (holding that although TPR was statutorily permissible because child had remained in foster care greater than fifteen of the preceding twenty-two months, it was not in childâ€™s best interests to terminate the fatherâ€™s rights).Â  Here, the hearings were rescheduled and delayed several times, which prolonged Trevon M.â€™s stay in foster care.Â  Furthermore, not all of these delays were attributable to the acts of Mother.Â  We agree with Justice Pleicones when he stated: â€œI am not willing to sever the parent-child relationship solely on the basis that [the statutory grounds for TPR have been met] where the [parent] presented substantial evidence that much of the delay in the processing of this case is attributable to the acts of others.â€Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cochran, 356 S.C. 413, 420, 589 S.E.2d 753, 756 (2003) (Pleicones, J., concurring).Â  Despite these delays, we believe the family court was correct in allowing DSS to proceed given the specific facts and circumstances surrounding this case.Â  \r\n[3]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-098","title":"Dickey v.

Dickey, of Charlotte, Pro Se.\r\n        Marian W. Scalise, Charles E. Carpenter, Jr. and Carmen V. Ganjehsani, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  James Dickey appeals the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment on his wrongful death, negligence, and breach of contract causes of action.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nFrom April 2001 to June 2002, Dickeyâ€™s diabetic mother resided at Clarke Nursing Home (the Nursing Home).Â  In April and May 2002, his mother was repeatedly admitted to Carolinas Hospital System (the Hospital).Â  From May 31, 2002 until she was discharged on June 24, 2002, the Hospital treated Dickeyâ€™s mother for foot sores.Â  Prior to her discharge, the Hospital called Dickey and requested his permission to amputate her feet, which he granted.Â  Dickeyâ€™s mother died in June 2003.[1]Â  \r\nOn June 30, 2005, Dickey, both in his individual capacity and as personal representative (PR) of his motherâ€™s estate, filed a complaint against the Nursing Home, Cooke Associates of Florence, Inc.,[2] the Hospital, and DOES A-Z.[3]Â  Dickey alleged: (1) professional and medical negligence; (2) gross professional and medical negligence; (3) wrongful death; and (4) breach of contract.[4] Â \r\nIn his complaint, Dickey maintained the Nursing Home, despite knowing his mother was diabetic, transported her in a wheelchair without foot guards or footwear protection.Â  Dickey alleged that because of this practice, she developed ulcers on her feet and heels.Â  These ulcers became infected and resulted in her untimely death. Â \r\nDickey also asserted the Hospital failed to conduct a timely and adequate medical assessment, evaluation, and treatment of his mother.Â  He further alleged the Hospital failed to provide an accurate report of her medical condition.Â  Dickey contended the Hospitalâ€™s inaction resulted in delayed diagnosis and improper medical evaluation and treatment, all of which contributed to the rapid decline of his motherâ€™s health and ultimately her death.Â  Further, Dickey asserted the Hospital intentionally covered up facts, which if revealed, would prove the Nursing Home negligently treated his mother.Â  \r\nOn July 13, 2005, the Hospital answered and filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming the statute of limitations barred the claims.Â  The Hospital asserted Dickeyâ€™s mother last received medical care at its facility on June 24, 2002, but Dickey commenced the suit over three years later on June 30, 2005.Â  \r\nOn September 20, 2005, the trial court held a hearing on the Hospitalâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  The trial court found the date that the Hospital informed Dickey his mother needed an amputation was the date that a reasonable person would be on notice that a potential claim existed.Â  Dickey could not recall the exact date that the Hospital informed him his mother needed an amputation.Â  Therefore, the trial court set the date beginning the statute of limitations no later than June 24, 2002, the date of her last discharge.Â  Accordingly, the statute of limitations expired no later than June 24, 2005, six days before Dickey filed the complaint.Â  \r\nOn September 27, 2005, after the summary judgment hearing, the South Carolina Bar placed Dickey on interim suspension for an unrelated matter.[5] Â On November 7, 2005, Dickey filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion for reconsideration regarding the summary judgment motion.Â  In ruling on the motion for reconsideration, the trial court found Dickey was authorized to file the complaint in his individual capacity, but he was not authorized to file it on behalf of the estate due to his suspension.Â  See Brown v. Coe, 365 S.C. 137, 142, 616 S.E.2d 705, 708 (2005) (holding because an estate is a separate legal entity from the individual named as PR, a PR who is not a lawyer cannot represent an estate in court).Â  Because his license was suspended, his attempt to file the motion on behalf of his motherâ€™s estate was tantamount to the unauthorized practice of law. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-5-310 (Supp. 2005).Â  Therefore, the trial court considered the order only as to Dickey in his individual capacity and denied the motion.Â  In his individual capacity, Dickey appealed the trial courtâ€™s decision. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the disposition of cases not requiring the services of a fact finder.&nbsp; George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).&nbsp; When reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this Court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Under this rule, summary judgment is proper when no genuine issue as to any material fact exists, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.&nbsp; Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).&nbsp; \r\nIn determining whether a triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all factual inferences drawn from it must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.&nbsp; Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of South Carolina, 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161, 165 (2003).&nbsp; If evidentiary facts are not disputed, but the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them are disputed, summary judgment should be denied. Â Baugus v. Wessinger, 303 S.C. 412, 415, 401 S.E.2d 169, 171 (1991).&nbsp; Summary judgment is not appropriate when further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of law.&nbsp; Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDickey assigns several points of error to the trial courtâ€™s grant of the Hospitalâ€™s motion for summary judgment based on the statute of limitations.Â  In response, the Hospital contends that Dickey, in his individual capacity, cannot pursue these causes of action.Â  We agree with the Hospital.Â  \r\nAt the trial level, Dickey asserted claims for wrongful death, negligence, gross negligence, and breach of contract.Â  We address each claim in turn. \r\nI. Wrongful Death\r\nThe wrongful death statute provides a remedy for the spouse, child, parent, or heir of an injured party when a person commits a wrongful or negligent act causing the injured partyâ€™s death.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-51-10, 15-51-20 (Supp. 2005).Â  Any recovery directly benefits the individual rather than the decedentâ€™s general estate.Â  Lester v. McFaddon, 415 F.2d 1101, 1103 (4th Cir. 1969).Â  However, any recovery under this cause of action constitutes the individualâ€™s complete remedy.Â  See Banks v. Med. Univ. of S.C., 314 S.C. 376, 380, 444 S.E.2d 519, 521 (1994) (holding that if a mother brings a claim in her individual capacity for her decedent child, the wrongful death statute is her exclusive remedy); Green v. S. Ry. Co., 319 F. Supp. 919, 919-20 (D.S.C. 1970) (holding recovery under the wrongful death statute is the exclusive remedy for an individual). Â Therefore, Dickeyâ€™s only vehicle to recover for his motherâ€™s death is under the wrongful death statute.Â  \r\nAlthough the wrongful death statute is the only avenue of recovery for Dickey as an individual, such an action inheres only in the PR, and the statutory beneficiaries cannot proceed in their individual capacity. Â Lester, 415 F.2d at 1103.Â  Under the statute, â€œthe right of action for wrongful death is purely statutory and . . . may be brought only by the executor or administrator of such deceased person.â€Â  Glenn v. E. I. DuPont De Nemours &amp; Co., 254 S.C. 128, 133, 174 S.E.2d 155, 157 (1970) (citing Lilly v. Charlotte, C. &amp; A. R. Co., 32 S.C. 142, 10 S.E. 932 (1890)); see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-51-20&nbsp;(Supp. 2005) (â€œEvery [wrongful death] action shall be brought by or in the name of the executor or administrator of such person.â€).Â  \r\nWhile a non-lawyer PR may administer the affairs of an estate and maintain an action on the estateâ€™s behalf, a PR must be a lawyer if the PR intends to represent the estate in court.Â  Brown, 365 S.C. at 141, 616 S.E.2d at 708.Â  Because the estate is a separate legal entity, only a lawyer can represent the interests of the estate and its beneficiaries in court.Â  Id. at 142, 616 S.E.2d at 708 (holding â€œthe filing of a notice of appeal on behalf of the estate and preparation of briefs . . . clearly constitutes the practice of lawâ€).Â  \r\nConsequently, Dickeyâ€™s appeal on the wrongful death claim in his individual capacity cannot succeed. Â If an action for wrongful death is instituted by one other than the PR of a decedent, the trial court should dismiss the action.Â  Glenn, 254 S.C. at 134, 174 S.E.2d at 158.Â  Although Dickey could have potentially recovered as an individual under the wrongful death statute if he, as PR, brought the action and a licensed lawyer represented the estate in court, he failed to do so. Â Therefore, the trial court properly dismissed this claim. \r\nII.Â  Negligence and Gross Negligence\r\nDickeyâ€™s claims for negligence and gross negligence arise out of the same alleged malfeasance as that alleged for wrongful death.Â  As explained above, wrongful death is the only remedy for an individual.Â  While as PR he may have had a potential claim for negligence under the survival statute, Dickey has appealed only in his individual capacity.Â  See Banks, 314 S.C. at 381 n.5, 444 S.E.2d at 522 n.5 (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-5-90 (2005)) (â€œAlthough . . . wrongful death is [decedentâ€™s motherâ€™s] exclusive remedy [in her individual capacity], the battery cause of action may be maintained by [the mother] in her representative capacity for [decedent] under the survival statute.â€). Â Consequently, the trial court did not err when it dismissed these claims.\r\nIII. Breach of Contract\r\nDickeyâ€™s appeal is unclear as to whether the breach of contract cause of action pertains to the Hospital.Â  Upon review of the complaint, the alleged breach of contract seems aimed only at the Nursing Home, and the appeal before this Court concerns only the Hospital.Â  \r\nEven if the breach of contract claim pertains to the Hospital, Dickey has appealed only in his individual capacity.Â  Dickey does not specifically assert that he had a contract with the Hospital nor does he provide such a contract.Â  Generally, a third person not in privity of contract with the contracting parties does not have a right to enforce the contract.Â  Wogan v. Kunze, 366 S.C. 583, 604, 623 S.E.2d 107, 118 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  While his mother may have had a contract with the Hospital, Dickey in his individual capacity cannot enforce such a contract, and thus, he has no cause of action for breach of contract.Â  \r\nOn appeal, the Hospital primarily argues that this Court should affirm the trial court based on the expiration of the statute of limitations.Â  The Hospital further supports its position by arguing that Dickey, in his personal capacity, is not entitled to maintain the current action.Â  See Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 419, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000) (â€œ[A] respondent . . . may raise . . . any additional reasons the appellate court should affirm the lower courtâ€™s ruling, regardless of whether those reasons have been presented to or ruled on by the lower court.â€).Â  Because this Court has the discretion to affirm on any ground in the record, we decline to address Dickeyâ€™s arguments regarding the statute of limitations. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive); see also Rule 220(c), SCACR (â€œThe appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, decision or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.â€).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe wrongful death statute provides an individualâ€™s only avenue of recovery for wrongful or negligent acts which cause anotherâ€™s death.Â  Further, a duly appointed PR must institute a wrongful death action on behalf of the estate, and a licensed lawyer must represent the estate in court.Â  Since Dickey appealed the trial courtâ€™s decision only in his individual capacity, he cannot maintain this appeal.Â  Â Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.[6]Â  \r\nHUFF, BEATTY, AND WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Neither the Record on Appeal nor the briefs contain the exact date or cause of death.\r\n[2] Dickey asserts that Cooke Associates of Florence, Inc. is another name for the Nursing Home.Â  \r\n[3] In his complaint, Dickey explained that he did not know the identity of some defendants in this matter, and thus, he gave the unknown defendants the name DOES A-Z.Â  Dickey stated he would make a motion to amend his complaint â€œwhen the true capacity, identity, or names of these [d]efendants has been ascertained.â€Â  \r\n[4] Dickey was a licensed South Carolina attorney at the time of the filing and represented himself and the estate.Â  \r\n[5] In re Dickey, 366 S.C. 18, 620 S.E.2d 332 (2005).Â  \r\n[6] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-099","title":"State v.

Â Haithcock appeals, asserting the trial court erred in denying her motion for a directed verdict.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn the afternoon of January 24, 2001, two women discovered the body of Kenneth Wayne Coates, Sr. in an abandoned house on Dongola Highway in Horry County.Â  Two spent bullet casings from a .25 semi automatic round were found at the scene:Â  one at the foot of Mr. Coates and the other just above the head.Â  An autopsy revealed Mr. Coates had been shot in the back of the neck and in the left forehead.Â  The shot to the forehead was qualified as the cause of death.Â  An expert in crime scene investigation testified it was his opinion Mr. Coates was shot in the back of the neck while in an upright position, collapsed to the ground, and received the second shot while he was lying on the floor in the abandoned home.Â  The forensic pathologist who performed an autopsy on Mr. Coates on January 25, 2001 testified she estimated at the time of the autopsy that Mr. Coates had been dead greater than four days.Â  However, given the cooler temperatures that occurred that January, she stated Mr. Coates could have been dead for three weeks, and could have possibly died on January 6, 2001.Â  It is undisputed that Mr. Coates was murdered.Â  \r\nMike Owens testified Mr. Coates had worked for his company since 1966.Â  The last day he worked was Friday, January 5, 2001.Â  Mr. Coates left work that evening around 5:00.Â  Owens testified Mr. Coatesâ€™ usual habit was to work on Saturday mornings.Â  However, he did not show up for work that next morning.Â  They did not look for him, though, and only became concerned when Mr. Coates failed to show up for work on Monday.Â  Although Owens stated there was a time several years back where Mr. Coates, without explanation, failed to show for work for approximately three or four days, he testified this was not typical behavior of Mr. Coates, who usually called in if he was going to be off somewhere.Â  Mr. Coates never came back to work after that Friday, and Owens had not seen him since then. \r\nPhil Whittaker also testified regarding the last contact he had with Mr. Coates.Â  Whittaker stated he was a close friend to Mr. Coates and usually saw him four, five or six times a week, often playing golf on the weekends and shooting pool.Â  On the evening of Friday, January 5, Whittaker and Mr. Coates met for a cocktail.Â  They went to another establishment to play pool and sing Karaoke, went back to the first meeting place, then on to a restaurant.Â  They left the restaurant around 2:30 a.m. that Saturday.Â  Mr. Coates headed toward his home in his white Ford Explorer.Â  Whittaker called Mr. Coates in the morning, attempting to contact him through his cell phone, his home phone and his pager without success.Â  Whittaker testified Mr. Coates usually went to work on Saturday mornings, and if he was busy at work, he may not return his call right away, but would call about an hour later.Â  On this occasion, Mr. Coates never called him back.Â  Whittaker never saw Mr. Coates after that night. \r\nThe State presented evidence from several witnesses who saw a female and a white Ford Explorer on January 6, 2001 near the abandoned home where Mr. Coatesâ€™ body was found.Â  Wade Lawrimore testified that on that day, he had been working at his shop and needed to pick up a gas can from his home.Â  After picking up the can, he drove by the abandoned home that belonged to his mother and observed a white Ford Explorer parked by a pile of dirt that he had placed in the area to keep people from driving behind the house.Â  He stopped to check on the situation and talked with a woman sitting in the driverâ€™s seat of the Explorer.Â  Also present was a person in the passengerâ€™s seat, looking straight ahead.Â  Wade asked what they were doing there, and the woman told him they had run out of gas.Â  Wade offered to go get some gas for them, but the woman declined, stating that her boyfriend had already caught a ride and was headed toward Waccamaw Grocery to retrieve some gas.Â  Wade stated he could see the woman because she leaned out of the window, but he never got a clear sight of the person sitting in the passenger seat.Â  He saw a silhouette of the passenger, who he assumed was a man.Â  The passenger never spoke.Â  From the silhouette he could tell the head of this person rested on a headrest, and constantly looked forward.Â  Wade got an uneasy feeling from the situation with the unmoving passenger, and thought the two people may have been in an argument.Â  Because it was the middle of the day, Wade then drove off to the store to get some lunch.Â  As he drove down the road, he did not see anyone walking with a gas can. Â Thereafter, Wade was shown a photographic array and picked Wanda Haithcockâ€™s picture out as the woman he had observed at the abandoned home at the time in question.Â  \r\nWadeâ€™s nephew, Steven Lawrimore, and Stevenâ€™s wife, Ginger Lawrimore, also testified to seeing a woman and a white Ford Explorer in the area of the abandoned home on January 6, 2001.Â  Steven testified that it was after dark on that date when he and his wife were driving on Dongola Highway and noticed a white Explorer at his grandmotherâ€™s old house.Â  When they stopped to see why it was there, they saw a woman standing on the porch of the home of his deceased uncle, approximately 150 to 200 yards away.Â  Steven asked the woman if she needed help, and she stated she was trying to use a phone.Â  The woman said she had run out of gas, and someone had picked up her boyfriend to go retrieve some.Â  Steven told the woman that no one lived at the residence and that he could take her to a telephone.Â  The woman, who seemed to be nervous, then got in the vehicle with Steven and Ginger.Â  They drove approximately 100 yards to the home of Stevensâ€™ parents.Â  Steven took the woman inside and handed her a cordless phone. Â Steven heard beeps, as if the woman dialed a number, then muffled conversation.Â  After she made the phone call, Steven and Ginger drove her back to the Explorer that was parked at Stevenâ€™s grandmotherâ€™s house. Â Steven asked the woman if she wanted them to wait with her since there had been problems with people vandalizing the house in the past.Â  The woman declined, stating her boyfriend would be back shortly.Â  The woman then got in the driverâ€™s seat of the Explorer.Â  Steven was shown a photographic array approximately two to three weeks later, but was unable to definitely pick out the woman he gave a ride to that night.Â  \r\nGinger Lawrimore testified that on January 6, 2001, she and her husband noticed a white Ford Explorer sitting in her husbandâ€™s grandmotherâ€™s driveway.Â  They pulled into the driveway and saw a lady standing on the porch of Stevenâ€™s deceased uncleâ€™s house.Â  They backed out of the grandmotherâ€™s driveway and drove over to the uncleâ€™s house.Â  As the woman approached the car, Gingerâ€™s husband rolled down his window and asked her if there was a problem.Â  The woman stated that she and her boyfriend had run out of gas, but that he had caught a ride with someone.Â  Steven and Ginger then gave the woman a ride to his parentsâ€™ home.Â  Ginger described the woman as being very nervous, â€œtwiddling her handsâ€ and making no conversation.Â  Thereafter, while watching the news one day, Steven and Ginger learned that a dead body had been discovered in Stevenâ€™s grandmotherâ€™s house.Â  They also heard that the dead man owned a white Explorer, which was missing.Â  The couple then contacted the police. Â On January 24, the day Mr. Coatesâ€™ body was found, a detective with the Horry County Police Department spoke with Steven and Ginger about the matter.Â  Ginger picked out Haithcockâ€™s picture as the individual she had seen near the abandoned house on January 6.Â  Ginger also made an in-court identification of Haithcock as the person she saw on Dongola Highway that day.Â  \r\nHaithcockâ€™s sister, Cynthia Bowling also testified on behalf of the State.Â  In January 2001, Cynthia, who lived in Charleston, was contacted by Haithcock.Â  Haithcock was living in Myrtle Beach at the time, and she told Cynthia she was coming to Charleston at 10:00 a.m. on January 25 and she wanted Cynthia to meet her at a Burger King there. Â Â When Cynthia met her as requested, Haithcock was driving a white Ford Explorer.Â  Haithcock told Cynthia she needed a place to park the car.Â  Cynthia told Haithcock it was not a problem, that she had a friend with a big yard, and she could park the car there as long as she needed. Â After Haithcock followed Cynthia to her friendsâ€™ house, the Colaskoâ€™s, she parked the Explorer and Cynthia gave Haithcock a ride to their motherâ€™s home.Â  Thereafter, Cynthia contacted the Horry County Sheriffâ€™s Department.Â  She told officers she did not know what was going on, but that her sister had brought her an Explorer and asked her to park it, and whatever was going on with the situation, she did not want anything to do with it.Â  Cynthia further testified that, prior to 1997 or 1998, Haithcock and Mr. Coates had a close relationship, having lived together and bought properties together, including land, a condo, and a boat.Â  After that time, they still engaged in sexual relations and would have dinner together, but they lived separately.Â  \r\nAfter receiving information from Horry County authorities regarding an Explorer being located on Johnâ€™s Island, officers from Charleston County went to the Colasko residence and found the automobile parked in a wooded area next to a house.Â  The tag on the vehicle was run through the system and it came back as being registered to the victim, Mr. Coates.Â  \r\nAt trial, the State presented gun and bullet evidence providing possible links between Haithcock and the weapon and ammunition used to kill Mr. Coates.Â  Records from a Myrtle Beach pawn shop showed Haithcock had purchased a Taurus PT-25 caliber handgun on August 8, 1997.Â  During their investigation, officers also discovered in a bag belonging to Haithcock a receipt for a magazine clip for a Taurus PT-25 caliber pistol which showed the clip was purchased by Wanda Haithcock on November 7, 2000.Â  A search of Haithcockâ€™s residence turned up a .25 caliber live round of ammunition found on a bookshelf in the living room area.Â  The State presented the testimony of SLED Agent Ira Parnell, who was qualified as an expert in firearm identification, including ammunition and ammunition component.Â  Agent Parnell examined the two .25 caliber cartridge cases found at the crime scene, the unfired cartridge found in Haithcockâ€™s home, and the two bullets retrieved from Coatesâ€™ body.Â  The agent testified they were â€œlooking at a semi automatic .25 auto caliber pistolâ€ that was used in this case.Â  In comparing the two fired bullets retrieved from Mr. Coatesâ€™ body, he determined they were fired from the same gun.Â  He also stated, while there were hundreds of different .25 caliber firearms, there were only seven brands of guns that could have fired those bullets, and one of those brands was a Taurus.Â  In comparing the two fired cartridge cases found at the scene, Agent Parnell was able to determine they had been fired from the same firearm.Â  Additionally, in comparing the two fired cartridge cases microscopically to the unfired cartridge found in Haithcockâ€™s home, he concluded from the extractor and ejector and other handling marks that the unfired cartridge had been loaded into and extracted from the same firearm that had fired the two shell casings found at the crime scene.Â  Thus, all three had been loaded into the same gun at some time.Â  Additionally, the two fired cartridge cases and the one unfired cartridge were all the same caliber, manufacturer and brand.Â  \r\nFollowing the close of the Stateâ€™s case, Haithcock moved for a directed verdict arguing the evidence was insufficient to support the charge against her.Â  The trial court denied the motion finding the evidence, albeit circumstantial, was sufficient to send the case to the jury when considered in the light most favorable to the State.Â  Thereafter, the jury convicted Haithcock of murder, and this appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Haithcock contends the trial court erred in denying her motion for directed verdict based on the evidence presented.Â  She argues there was no evidence of any animosity between her and the victim, the evidence as to the time of the victimâ€™s death was weak and she was only placed at the abandoned house nineteen days before the victimâ€™s body was discovered, there was no evidence placing her inside of the house where the body was found, and the evidence showed the house was a haven for unseemly activity.Â  Additionally, she argues the evidence of the chambered bullet could be explained by the fact that she and the victim had access to each otherâ€™s property, such that the victim could have had her gun at the time of his death, giving access to anyone who had access to him.Â  Accordingly, Haithcock contends the State failed to show substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove her guilt, and the trial court therefore erred in failing to direct a verdict of not guilty.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn reviewing the denial of a motion for a directed verdict, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Fennell, 340 S.C. 266, 270, 531 S.E.2d 512, 514 (2000). Â If there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, we must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  State v. McCombs, 368 S.C. 489, 493, 629 S.E.2d 361, 363 (2006).Â Â  When a motion for directed verdict is made where the state relies exclusively on circumstantial evidence, the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not with its weight.Â  State v. Cherry, 361 S.C. 588, 594, 606 S.E.2d 475, 478 (2004).Â  Â Â Â Â  \r\nWhere the evidence is circumstantial, the trial court has a duty to submit the case to the jury if there is substantial circumstantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused, or from which the accusedâ€™s guilt may be fairly and logically deduced.Â  State v. Arnold, 361 S.C. 386, 389, 605 S.E2d 529, 531 (2004).Â  â€œUnless there is a total failure of competent evidence as to the charges alleged, refusal by the trial judge to direct a verdict of acquittal is not error.â€Â  Id. Â On the other hand, the trial court should grant a directed verdict motion when the evidence merely raises a suspicion that the accused is guilty.Â  Id. at 390, 605 S.E.2d at 531.Â  â€œâ€˜Suspicionâ€™ implies a belief or opinion as to guilt based upon facts or circumstances which do not amount to proof.â€ Â Cherry, 361 S.C. at 594, 606 S.E.2d at 478. Â However, the trial court is not required to find that the evidence infers guilt to the exclusion of any other reasonable hypothesis before denying a motion for directed verdict.Â  Id.Â  Rather, our supreme court has â€œrejected the contention that in ruling on a directed verdict motion, the trial judge must grant a directed verdict unless the circumstantial evidence pointed conclusively to the defendantâ€™s guilt, to the exclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis.â€Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nIn the instant case, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the record provides substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove Haithcockâ€™s guilt.Â  Haithcock was identified by two people as the woman who was found outside the same abandoned home where Mr. Coates was found shot, on the exact same day as Mr. Coatesâ€™ disappearance.Â  Not only was she was identified as being present at the scene of the crime around mid-day, she was identified as being seen there some time after darkness on that date by another individual. Â While she gave the story earlier in the day that she had run out of gas and that her boyfriend had had already caught a ride to go bring some back, she was again seen at the location after dark, giving the same story about having run out of gas and her boyfriend catching a ride to go retrieve some.Â  Additionally, she was seen earlier in the day sitting in the driverâ€™s seat of a white Ford Explorer at the abandoned house, the same color and make of car as owned by Mr. Coates.Â  Â She was later observed getting into the driverâ€™s side of the Explorer when she was returned to the car that night after making a phone call. Â The case received media attention on January 24, 2001, and the very next day, Haithcock drove Mr. Coatesâ€™ white Ford Explorer to Charleston and asked her sister for help finding a place to park the car.Â  Finally, there was evidence presented that Haithcock owned a Taurus PT-25 caliber handgun, the same caliber as that used in the murder of Mr. Coates and one of only seven out of hundreds of .25 caliber guns that could have fired the bullets recovered from Mr. Coatesâ€™ body.Â Â  The evidence also showed Haithcock had purchased a magazine clip for a Taurus PT-25 caliber pistol approximately two months before the murder, and a .25 caliber live round of ammunition found in Haithcockâ€™s home was determined to have been chambered in the same firearm that had fired the two shell casings found at the crime scene.Â  As well, the two fired cartridge cases found at the scene and the one unfired cartridge found in Haithcockâ€™s home were all the same caliber, manufacturer and brand.\r\nGiven the evidence of (1) Haithcockâ€™s presence at the scene of the crime at two different times on the same day as Mr. Coatesâ€™ disappearance, (2) the fact that she was observed at the scene with the same color and make of car as owned by Mr. Coates, (3) the fact that she was inexplicably seen around mid-day and again after dark, both times claiming to have run out of gas and that her boyfriend had caught a ride to get some gasoline, (4) the fact that she drove Mr. Coatesâ€™ white Ford Explorer to Charleston the day after Mr. Coatesâ€™ body was discovered and the news was disseminated through the media, inferably attempting to hide the vehicle, (5) and the fact that there was gun and bullet evidence possibly linking Haithcock and the weapon and ammunition used to kill Mr. Coates, we find there was substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of Haithcock, and that the case was properly submitted to the jury.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, appellantâ€™s conviction is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-100","title":"Dutch Fork Development Group v.

Turner Pope, Jr., Glenn E. Bowens, and Tony S. Catone, allÂ  of Blythewood, for Appellants.\r\n        Camden Lewis, Keith M. Babcock and Brady R. Thomas, all of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Dutch Fork Development Group II and Dutch Fork Realty (collectively referred to hereinafter as Dutch Fork) appeal the trial courtâ€™s quashing of three notices of lis pendens filed on real estate owned by SEL Properties, LLC.Â  We affirm.[1] \r\nFACTS\r\nIn November 2000 and October 2002, Dutch Fork entered into two separate contracts with SEL.Â  Each contract provided Dutch Fork would develop, market, and sell certain real property owned by SEL; the November 2000 contract covers phases I, II, and III of SELâ€™s development, while the October 2002 contract covers phase IV of SELâ€™s development, which encompasses separate property located in close proximity to the original development.Â  Under the terms of the contracts, SEL agreed to pay Dutch Fork certain monthly compensation for the services provided.Â  In addition, the contracts gave Dutch Fork: (1) the exclusive right to sell the developed lots and receive a 10% commission upon closing the sale; and (2) the right to receive 25% of the net profits from the lots sold. Â \r\nIn February 2005, Dutch Fork filed an action against SEL alleging causes of action for breach of contract, conversion, and tortious interference with contract.Â  Thereafter, Dutch Fork filed a lis pendens affecting land owned by SEL in phases I, II, and III on March 4, 2005.Â  Dutch Fork filed a second lis pendens affecting the same property on April 6, 2005.Â  Finally, on April 8, 2005, Dutch Fork filed another lis pendens affecting SEL land in phase IV.Â  \r\nSubsequently, SEL filed this action to â€œQuash Lis Pendens.â€Â  After a hearing, the trial court found the notices of lis pendens did not comply with section 15-11-10 of the South Carolina Code (2005) because the underlying action allegedly giving rise to each lis pendens did not affect title to real property.Â  Thus, the trial court ordered the cancellation of each lis pendens.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Real Property Affected \r\nDutch Fork argues the trial court erred in finding each lis pendens does not comply with section 15-11-10.Â  Specifically, Dutch Fork contends the action giving rise to the notices of lis pendens affects real property, and therefore, the trial court erred in granting SELâ€™s motion to quash each lis pendens.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn reviewing a lis pendens, courts generally look only to the underlying cause of action to determine whether the action comes within the provisions of the lis pendens statute.Â  54 C.J.S. Lis Pendens Â§ 40 (2005). Â Since the filing of a lis pendens is an extraordinary privilege granted by statute, strict compliance with the statutory provisions is required.Â  Pond Place Partners, Inc. v. Poole, 351 S.C. 1, 17, 567 S.E.2d 881, 889 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Generally, â€œ[t]he lis pendens statute applies to an in rem interest in real estate that affects either the title to the property, or a right to the possession of it.â€Â  51 Am. Jur. 2d Lis Pendens Â§ 19 (2000).Â  â€œ[I]n order to invoke the doctrine of lis pendens, it is not sufficient that a property be the source out of which the plaintiff will be compensated.Â  Rather, the property that is described for the purpose of invoking the doctrine must be at the very essence of the controversy between the litigants.â€Â  Id.\r\nâ€œThe purpose of a notice of pendency of an action is to inform a purchaser or encumbrancer that a particular piece of real property is subject to litigation.â€Â  Shelley Constr. Co., v. Sea Garden Homes, Inc., 287 S.C. 24, 30, 336 S.E.2d 488, 491 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  The filing of a lis pendens places a cloud on title and prevents the owner from freely disposing of the property before the litigation is resolved.Â  Id. at 30, 336 S.E.2d at 491-92.Â  \r\nIn Pond Place Partners, this court explained the principal reason for allowing the filing of a lis pendens: \r\n\r\n  The lis pendens mechanism is not designed to aid either side in a dispute between private parties. Rather, lis pendens is designed primarily to protect unidentified third parties by alerting prospective purchasers of property as to what is already on public record, i.e., the fact of a suit involving property. Thus, it notifies potential purchasers that there is pending litigation that may affect their title to real property and that the purchaser will take subject to the judgment, without any substantive rights.\r\n\r\n351 S.C. at 17, 567 S.E.2d at 889. \r\nIn South Carolina, a lis pendens may be filed â€œ[i]n an action affecting the title to real property.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-11-10 (2005).Â  â€œ[A]n action â€˜affecting the title to real propertyâ€™ clearly allows the filing of a lis pendens by an interested party in order to protect their ownership interest in the property subject to the litigation.â€Â  Pond Place Partners, 351 S.C. at 17, 567 S.E.2d at 889.Â  Such actions include: (1) actions attempting to set aside a fraudulent conveyance of real property; (2) actions to establish a constructive trust over real estate; (3) actions to quiet title; (4) actions to establish the existence of an easement; (5) actions to reform deeds to resolve a boundary dispute; (6) actions for specific performance; and (7) actions for mortgage foreclosure.Â  Id. at 17-18, 567 S.E.2d at 889-90 (citations omitted).\r\nIn the lawsuit giving rise to the notices of lis pendens, Dutch Fork only requests actual and punitive damages for injuries stemming from SELâ€™s alleged breach of contract, conversion, and tortious interference with contract.Â  We find Dutch Forkâ€™s underlying action does not affect title to SELâ€™s real property but rather seeks money damages arising from a contractual dispute involving the development of real property.Â  In general, â€œan action for money only, even if it relates in some way to specific real property, will not support a lis pendens.â€Â  54 C.J.S. Lis Pendens Â§ 11 (2005); see also Armstrong v. Carwile, 56 S.C. 463, 476, 35 S.E. 196, 203 (1900) (holding an ordinary action on a money demand that did not in any way affect the title to real estate is not an action in which the filing of a notice of lis pendens is authorized).Â  \r\nDutch Fork argues the United States District Courtâ€™s analysis of South Carolinaâ€™s lis pendens statute in Finley v. Hughes, 106 F. Supp. 355 (E.D.S.C. 1952), suggests each lis pendens in this action complies with section 15-11-10.Â  In Finley, the court determined an action which referenced real estate and sought, in part, to establish a constructive trust allowed for the filing of a lis pendens because the action affected title to real estate.Â  Id. at 356.Â  In so finding the court held:Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n  The doctrine of lis pendens applies to all suits or actions which directly affect real property, and not only those which involve the question of title, but also those which are brought to establish an equitable estate, interest, or right in specific real property or to enforce any lien, charge, or encumbrance against it, there being in some cases a lis pendens, although at the commencement of the suit there is no present vested interest, claim, or lien in or on the property which it seeks to charge.\r\n\r\nÂ Id. (quoting 54 C.J.S. Lis Pendens Â§ 9).Â  \r\nEven if we adopted the United States District Courtâ€™s interpretation, our analysis in this case is unaffected.Â  Finley is distinguishable from the subject action.Â  In their final issue in their brief, Dutch Fork argues equitable remedies support upholding each lis pendens.Â  Specifically, Dutch Fork argues a constructive trust could be established in its favor which should justify each lis pendens.Â  It also claims its relationship with SEL Properties was essentially a partnership and one of the objectives of this litigation was to settle the interests of the partiesâ€™ in the property. Â Â However, Dutch Fork never actually asserted causes of action for constructive trust or settlement of a partnership.Â  Dutch Fork merely prayed for â€œsuch other relief as [the] Court would deem just and properâ€ in the complaint.Â  Such a broad prayer for relief cannot be considered as the basis for the filing of a lis pendens.Â  SeeÂ  Speizman v. Guill, 202 S.C. 498, 515, Â 25 S.E.2d 731, 739 (1943) (â€œThe prayer is no part of the cause of action.Â  It cannot add anything to or take anything away from the facts pleaded.Â  The prayer is no part of the charging or pleading portion of the complaint, which is the controlling factor in determining what are the ultimate facts alleged.â€).\r\nThus, Dutch Fork, unlike the plaintiff in Finley, did not seek to establish a constructive trust in the underlying action.Â  Moreover, causes of action for breach of contract, conversion, and/or tortious interference with contract are not brought â€œto establish an equitable estate, interest, or right in specific real property or to enforce any lien, charge, or encumbrance against it.â€Â  Finley, 106 F. Supp. at 356.Â  Thus, even when considering Finley, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s ruling that the notices of lis pendens do not comply with section 15-11-10.\r\nII.&nbsp; Effect of Mechanicâ€™s Lien Statute\r\nDutch Fork contends title to real property is affected by this case because Dutch Fork has an â€œautomaticâ€ lien on the subject property arising from the mechanicâ€™s lien statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10 (Supp. 2005).Â  We disagree. \r\nUnder the mechanicâ€™s lien statute, â€œany person to whom a debt is due for labor performed or materials furnished in the erection, alteration or repair of a building or structure upon real estate is given a lien on the property to secure payment of the debt.â€Â  Shelley Constr. Co., v. Sea Garden Homes, Inc., 287 S.C. 24, 26, 336 S.E.2d 488, 489 (Ct. App. 1985); Â§ 29-5-10.Â  â€œThe lien arises, inchoate, when the labor is performed or the materials are furnished.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œHowever, to be valid, the lien must be perfected and enforced in compliance with the Mechanicâ€™s Lien Statutes . . . .â€Â  Preferred Sav. &amp; Loan Assn., Inc. v. Royal Garden Resort, Inc., 301 S.C. 1, 3, 389 S.E.2d 853, 854 (1990).Â  In order to perfect and enforce the lien against the property, the person claiming it must: (1) serve and record a certificate of lien within ninety days after he ceases to furnish labor or materials, (2) bring suit to foreclose the lien within six months after he ceases to furnish labor or materials, and (3) file notice of pendency of the action within six months after he ceases to furnish labor or materials.Â  Shelley Constr. Co., 287 S.C. at 27, 336 S.E.2d at 490; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-90 &amp; -120 (1991 &amp; Supp. 2005). Â As a mechanicâ€™s lien is purely statutory, the requirements of the statute must be strictly followed. Â Muller v. Myrtle Beach Golf &amp; Yacht Club, 303 S.C. 137, 140, 399 S.E.2d 430, 432 (Ct. App. 1990), overruled on other grounds by Myrtle Beach Hosp., Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 341 S.C. 1, 532 S.E.2d 868 (2000).Â Â  \r\nWhile Dutch Fork may have an inchoate lien on SELâ€™s property,[2] Dutch Fork has not attempted to perfect the lien and, therefore, cannot enforce the lien against the property at this time.Â  Id.Â  Dutch Forkâ€™s alleged inchoate lien cannot support any lis pendens filing because the inchoate lien is not mentioned as a basis for the underlying cause of action.Â  See 54 C.J.S. Lis Pendens Â§ 40 (2005) (stating courts generally look only to the complaint to determine whether the action comes within the provisions of the lis pendens statute); see also, Pond Place Partners, Inc. v. Poole, 351 S.C. 1, 17, 567 S.E.2d 881, 889 (Ct. App. 2002) (â€œSince the filing of a lis pendens is an extraordinary privilege granted by statute, strict compliance with the statutory provisions is required.â€).Â  As a result, the alleged inchoate lien cannot be used to justify the filing of any lis pendens.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the trial court did not err in quashing the notices of lis pendens.\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and WILLIAMS, JJ. concur.Â  Â \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] We note the determination of whether Dutch Fork may enforce a mechanicâ€™s lien against SELâ€™s properties is not before this court and we make no ruling on the matter. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
