On appeal, Morgan argues the circuit court erred in finding: (1)\r\n\nshe failed to timely appeal the single commissioner's order; (2) the statute of\r\nlimitations barred her petition for a change of condition; (3) her hospitalization\r\nfrom February 28, 2006, until May 16, 2006, was not due to a work-related injury;\r\nand (4) she failed to prove a compensable change of condition. We vacate the\r\ncircuit court's order and the decision of the Appellate Panel.\r\n\r\nWe find the Appellate Panel lacked jurisdiction over this appeal because Morgan\r\nfailed to timely appeal to the Appellate Panel. To appeal a decision of the single\r\ncommissioner, a party must file a Form 30 notice of appeal within fourteen days of\r\nreceiving notice of the single commissioner's order. See S.C. Code Ann.\r\n§ 42-17-50 (Supp. 2012); 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-701 (2012). The single\r\ncommissioner denied Morgan's petition for a change of condition by written order\r\non July 21, 2009; however, Morgan did not file a Form 30 appeal until October 1,\r\n2009. Although Morgan filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to reconsider with the\r\nsingle commissioner on July 31, 2009, this motion did not toll the time for Morgan\r\nto file a Form 30 because \"[such] motions are not applicable before the\r\n[c]ommission itself . . . .\" Rhame v. Charleston Cnty. Sch. Dist., 399 S.C. 477,\r\n482-83, 732 S.E.2d 202, 205 (Ct. App. 2012); see also id. at 483, 732 S.E.2d at\r\n205 (finding a petition for rehearing is inapplicable to matters before the Appellate\r\nPanel and, therefore, does not toll the time to file and serve a notice of appeal).\r\nTherefore, Morgan's Form 30 was untimely, and the Appellate Panel lacked\r\nappellate jurisdiction over the appeal. See Allison v. W.L. Gore & Assocs., 394\r\nS.C. 185, 189, 714 S.E.2d 547, 550 (2011) (finding the Appellate Panel lacked\r\nappellate jurisdiction when an appellant failed to file a Form 30 within fourteen\r\ndays after receiving notice of the single commissioner's order).\r\n\r\nAlthough the Appellate Panel correctly found Morgan's appeal was untimely, it\r\nerred by not dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.

Rotomotion contends\r\nthe circuit court erred in relying on Rule 56(c) SCRCP, when its decision was\r\n\nreally a default judgment based on Rotomotion's late-filed answer. Rotomotion\r\nalso argues the award of treble damages under the South Carolina Unfair Trade\r\nPractices Act was inappropriate. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1.     We affirm the circuit court's grant of Indra's summary judgment motion.\r\nSummary judgment was properly requested and granted in this case. See Rule\r\n56(a), SCRCP (\"A party seeking to recover upon a claim, counterclaim, or cross-\r\nclaim or to obtain a declaratory judgment may, at any time after the expiration of\r\n30 days from the commencement of the action or after service of a motion for\r\nsummary judgment by the adverse party, move with or without supporting\r\naffidavits for a summary judgment in his favor upon all or any part thereof.\").\r\nRotomotion did not timely serve an answer and did not move to file a late answer.\r\nSee Rule 12(a), SCRCP (requiring \"[a] defendant [to] serve his answer within 30\r\ndays after the service of the complaint upon him\"). Therefore, the allegations of\r\nthe complaint were deemed true. See Rule 8(d), SCRCP (\"Averments in a pleading\r\nto which a responsive pleading is required, other than those as to the amount of\r\ndamage, are admitted when not denied in the responsive pleading.\"). Thus, no\r\nissue of material fact exists. See Bovain v. Canal Ins., 383 S.C. 100, 105, 678\r\nS.E.2d 422, 424 (2009) (declaring \"[a]n appellate court reviews the granting of\r\nsummary judgment under the same standard applied by the [circuit] court under\r\nRule 56(c), SCRCP\"); Sloan v.

The issue of whether the trial court correctly applied the South Carolina\r\nUnfair Trade Practices Act, including whether the damages were properly trebled,\r\nis not preserved for review by this court. See State v. Bonner, 400 S.C. 561, 564,\r\n735 S.E.2d 525, 526 (Ct.

Michael Brackett, of Moses & Brackett, PC, of\r\n              Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Mell Woods appeals the circuit court's order granting summary\r\njudgment in favor of Respondents. Woods argues the circuit court erred in: (1)\r\ngranting summary judgment when issues of material fact remained; (2) denying his\r\nright to a jury trial in violation of section 15-67-100 of the South Carolina Code\r\n(2005); (3) finding Reba Hinson acquired a life estate under Levie Hinson's will;\r\nand (4) finding Reba Hinson, as a life tenant, could not claim adverse possession\r\nagainst the remaindermen to the life estate. We affirm.1\r\n\r\n1. As to issue one and issue three, the circuit court did not err in granting summary\r\njudgment because Woods failed to create a genuine issue as to any material fact.\r\nSee S. Glass & Plastics Co., Inc. v. Kemper, 399 S.C. 483, 490, 732 S.E.2d 205,\r\n208-09 (Ct. App. 2012) (\"When reviewing the grant of a summary judgment\r\nmotion, this court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule\r\n56(c), SCRCP; summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to\r\nany material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\").\r\nFirst, no evidence supports Woods's argument that the circuit court applied an\r\nimproper standard in granting summary judgment. The circuit court's order does\r\nnot specifically state the standard it applied in granting summary judgment. The\r\ncircuit court apparently treated the issues presented as questions of law, which was\r\nproper because the interpretation of a will is a question of law to be decided by the\r\ncourt. See 96 C.J.S. Wills § 901 (2011) (\"Generally, the interpretation or\r\nconstruction of a will, or so much thereof as is applicable to the case under\r\nconsideration, is a question of law for the court and not one of fact for the jury . . .\r\n.\" (footnotes omitted)). Moreover, although Levie Hinson's will was ambiguous,\r\nany ambiguity in the will was a patent ambiguity; therefore, the circuit court\r\nproperly resolved the issue as a matter of law. Beaufort Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. United\r\nNat. Ins. Co., 392 S.C. 506, 526, 709 S.E.2d 85, 95 (Ct. App. 2011) (stating \"[a]\r\npatent ambiguity is one that arises upon the words of a will, deed, or contract\"); 96\r\nC.J.S. Wills § 901 (\"When a patent ambiguity exists in a will, a court must resolve\r\nsuch ambiguity as a matter of law.\"); see also United Nat. Ins. Co., 392 S.C. at\r\n526, 709 S.E.2d at 95-96 (recognizing, in the context of an insurance policy, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1   We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\ninterpretation of a policy with a patent ambiguity is for the court). Furthermore,\r\nWoods's conclusory allegations of title to the property in question are insufficient\r\nto withstand summary judgment. Nelson v. Piggly Wiggly Cent., Inc., 390 S.C.\r\n382, 389, 701 S.E.2d 776, 779 (Ct. App. 2010) (\"As Rule 56(e), SCRCP, states, a\r\nparty 'may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading[s].'\"\r\n(citation omitted)); see also Shupe v. Settle, 315 S.C. 510, 516-17, 445 S.E.2d 651,\r\n655 (Ct. App. 1994) (\"A conclusory statement as to the ultimate issue in a case is\r\nnot sufficient to create a genuine issue of fact for purposes of resisting summary\r\njudgment.\").\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the circuit court properly determined Reba Hinson acquired a life\r\nestate under Levie Hinson's will. \"The cardinal rule in the construction of any will\r\nis to determine the intent of the testator as gleaned from the written instrument\r\nitself; technical rules or interpretation are subservient to that principle.\" Wise v.\r\nPoston, 281 S.C. 574, 577, 316 S.E.2d 412, 414 (Ct. App. 1984). Here, Levie\r\nHinson's will states: \"I will, devise and bequeath unto my beloved wife, [Reba\r\nHinson,] all my real estate, in fee simple, as long as she lives then to our bodily\r\nheirs forever.\" (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n             [W]hen a gift is made in one clause of a will in clear and\r\n             unequivocal terms, the quality or quantity of the estate\r\n             given should not be cut down or qualified by words of\r\n             doubtful import found in a subsequent clause. To have\r\n             that effect, the subsequent words should be at least as\r\n             clear in expressing that intention as the words in which\r\n             the interest is given.\r\n\r\nWates v. Fairfield Forest Prods. Co., 210 S.C. 319, 322, 42 S.E.2d 529, 530 (1947)\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\nAlthough Levie Hinson's will uses the term \"fee simple,\" the will also includes\r\nwords of limitation indicating Reba Hinson is entitled to the property \"as long as\r\nshe lives.\" The words of limitation are not of doubtful import; rather, they are as\r\nclear as the term \"fee simple\" and demonstrate Levie Hinson's intent to create a life\r\nestate. See Blackmon v. Weaver, 366 S.C. 245, 249, 621 S.E.2d 42, 44 (Ct. App.\r\n2005) (stating no special language is required to create a life estate, rather courts\r\nwill look to the intention of the creator of the estate); Epting v. Mayer, 283 S.C.\r\n517, 519, 323 S.E.2d 797, 798 (Ct. App. 1984) (\"If the intention of the testator is to\r\nbe given effect, as it must be, courts must be permitted . . . to disregard words of\r\nabsolute gift and to declare the estate created to be a limited estate where a clear\r\n\nintention to that effect appears.\"). Moreover, if we interpreted this will as vesting\r\nReba Hinson with a fee simple interest in the property, it would require us to\r\nignore the provision of the will, which provided for a remainder in the parties'\r\nheirs. See Blackmon, 366 S.C. at 250, 621 S.E.2d at 44 (stating \"a construction\r\nwhich gives meaning to all should be preferred over one which renders some\r\nprovisions meaningless\"). Therefore, because Reba Hinson inherited a life estate\r\nunder Levie Hinson's will, any interest Woods acquired in the property from Reba\r\nHinson extinguished when Reba Hinson died because \"a life tenant can convey no\r\nmore than his life estate.\" Poston, 281 S.C. at 579, 316 S.E.2d at 415.\r\nAccordingly, the circuit court did not err in granting summary judgment because\r\nWoods failed to show any genuine issue of material fact.\r\n\r\n2. As to whether the circuit court violated section 15-67-100 in denying Woods a\r\njury trial, we affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following\r\nauthorities: Cowburn v. Leventis, 366 S.C. 20, 41, 619 S.E.2d 437, 449 (Ct. App.\r\n2005) (\"In order for an issue to be preserved for appellate review, with few\r\nexceptions, it must be raised and ruled upon by the [circuit court].\"); Hickman v.\r\nHickman, 301 S.C. 455, 456, 392 S.E.2d 481, 482 (Ct. App. 1990) (\"A party\r\ncannot use Rule 59(e)[,SCRCP,] to present to the court an issue the party could\r\nhave raised prior to judgment but did not.\").\r\n\r\n3. As to whether the circuit court erred in finding Reba Hinson, as a life tenant,\r\ncould not claim adverse possession against the remaindermen to the life estate, we\r\naffirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities: Jones v.\r\nLeagan, 384 S.C. 1, 10, 681 S.E.2d 6, 11 (Ct.

Siegel, of Walterboro, all for Respondents.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: In this civil action, the Colleton County Sheriff's Department (the\r\nsheriff's office) appeals the jury verdict in favor of Jake Wright (Jake) and Theresa\r\nGadsden, as personal representatives of the estate of Jacob Cleveland Wright, and\r\nJake Wright and Theresa Gadsden, individually (collectively, Respondents). The\r\nsheriff's office asserts the trial court erred in (1) finding Martin Schussel's\r\ntestimony was reliable and qualifying him as an expert for the Respondents, (2)\r\ndenying its motions for a directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict\r\n(JNOV), and (3) denying its motions for a directed verdict and JNOV on the issue\r\nof negligent hiring. We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the\r\nfollowing authorities:\r\n\r\n1. As to whether the trial court erred in finding the software Schussel utilized in his\r\naccident reconstruction was reliable: See Rule 702, SCRE (\"If scientific, technical,\r\nor other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the\r\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by\r\nknowledge skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form\r\nof an opinion or otherwise.\"); see also Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., 326\r\nS.C. 248, 252, 487 S.E.2d 596, 598 (1997) (\"The qualification of an expert witness\r\nand the admissibility of the expert's testimony are matters within the trial court's\r\ndiscretion. An abuse of discretion occurs when there is an error of law or a factual\r\nconclusion which is without evidentiary support.\") (citations omitted); Watson v.\r\nFord Motor Co., 389 S.C. 434, 449, 699 S.E.2d 169, 177 (2010) (explaining that a\r\ntrial court not only has to find that a proffered expert has the knowledge, skill,\r\nexperience, training, or education in the field of expertise, the trial court must also\r\ndetermine that the substance of the expert's testimony is reliable); id. at 449-50,\r\n699 S.E.2d at 177 (providing several factors that the trial court should consider\r\nwhen determining whether scientific expert evidence is reliable: \"'(1) the\r\npublications and peer review of the technique; (2) prior application of the method\r\nto the type of evidence involved in the case; (3) the quality control procedures used\r\nto ensure reliability; and (4) the consistency of the method with recognized\r\nscientific laws and procedures.'\" (quoting State v.

As to whether the trial court erred in denying the sheriff's office's motions for a\r\ndirected verdict and JNOV on the issue of negligence on the basis that Deputy\r\nMcCoy's negligence, if any existed, was not the proximate cause of the accident:\r\n\nWright v.

We find the PCR court erred in finding Bradley's PCR allegation of\r\nineffective assistance of counsel was procedurally barred by subsection 17-27-\r\n20(b), which provides that errors that could have been reviewed on appeal may not\r\nbe asserted for the first time or reasserted in PCR proceedings.

Bettis, of Gignilliat, Savitz & Bettis, LLP, of\r\n            Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This appeal involves Respondent South Carolina Department of\r\nPublic Safety's (DPS) termination of Appellant Shawn Sorrell's employment. On\r\nappeal, Sorrell argues the Administrative Law Court (ALC) erred by using an\r\nincorrect legal standard to determine the existence of probable cause. Sorrell also\r\n\nargues the State Employee Grievance Committee (the Committee) violated his due\r\nprocess rights based on the Committee's procedure for compiling and distributing\r\nexhibits to the Committee's members and holding the second day of the hearing\r\nforty-three days after the first day of the hearing. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1. We find the two-issue rule requires affirmance of the ALC's decision. DPS\r\nfired Sorrell for two independent reasons: (1) for improperly arresting the\r\nindividuals without probable cause and (2) for his improper conduct during that\r\narrest. The ALC affirmed both reasons, and the issues presented to this court relate\r\nonly to one of the bases for the firing. Accordingly, the two-issue rule requires\r\naffirmance of the ALC's decision because Sorrell failed to raise or argue the issue\r\nof improper conduct on appeal to this court. See Jones v. Lott, 387 S.C. 339, 346,\r\n692 S.E.2d 900, 903 (2010) (providing that \"[u]nder the two issue rule, where a\r\ndecision is based on more than one ground, the appellate court will affirm unless\r\nthe appellant appeals all grounds\"); S.C.

Gaston Copper Recycling\r\nCorp., 316 S.C. 163, 170, 447 S.E.2d 843, 847 (1994) (\"This Court will affirm\r\nwhere an appellant fails to appeal the alternative ground of a trial [court's]\r\nruling.\"); First Union Nat'l Bank of S.C. v.

We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following\r\nauthorities:\r\n\r\n1.      As to whether the Appellate Panel erred in finding a disability rating of 39%\r\nto Roopra's shoulder and 4% to his neck because it gave little or no regard to his\r\nphysicians' impairment ratings: Wise v.

Appellants argue the Special Referee erred in holding the only\r\nremedies available were forfeiture of the earnest money and specific performance.\r\n\r\nWe find the Special Referee correctly determined the Agreement was\r\nunambiguous. See Ecclesiastes Prod. Ministries v. Outparcel Assocs., LLC, 374\r\nS.C. 483, 498, 649 S.E.2d 494, 501 (Ct. App. 2007) (\"To discover the intention of\r\na contract, the court must first look to its language – if the language is perfectly\r\nplain and capable of legal construction, it alone determines the document's force\r\nand effect.\"). We further find the Special Referee correctly determined that had\r\nthere been any ambiguity, it would have been resolved against Appellants, who\r\ndrafted the Agreement. See Davis v. KB Home of S.C., Inc., 394 S.C. 116, 129 n.4,\r\n\n713 S.E.2d 799, 805 n.4 (Ct. App. 2011) (holding any ambiguity in an agreement\r\nmust be construed against the drafter). Appellants assert that under Bannon v.\r\nKnauss, 282 S.C. 589, 592, 320 S.E.2d 470, 472 (Ct. App. 1984), the rule in South\r\nCarolina is that remedies specified in a real estate sales agreement are not the\r\nexclusive remedies of the seller unless the agreement clearly limits the seller to\r\nthose remedies. We find Bannon is not applicable to this case because the\r\nAgreement's language is clear as to the exclusive remedies available to the seller,\r\nwhich were forfeiture of the earnest money and specific performance. See Ellis v.\r\nTaylor, 316 S.C. 245, 248, 449 S.E.2d 487, 488 (noting a court's duty is to enforce\r\nan unambiguous contract according to its terms \"regardless of its wisdom or folly,\r\napparent unreasonableness, or the parties' failure to guard their rights carefully\").\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-029","title":"State v.

Neal,\r\n        III, and Yulee E. Harrelson, both of Columbia, for\r\n        Respondent.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: This appeal arises from the family court's final order of divorce.\r\nOn appeal, Appellant Mark Pelletier (Husband) argues the family court erred by:\r\n(1) transmuting Husband's nonmarital assets; (2) valuing Husband's dental office\r\nbuilding; (3) equitably dividing marital property; and (4) awarding attorney's fees.\r\nWe affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\n\r\n1. We find the family court did not abuse its discretion in determining the dental\r\npractice, dental office building, and lake lot were transmuted into marital property.\r\nThe evidence in the record supports a finding that during the marriage, the parties\r\nintended to treat the disputed property as marital property. See Myers v. Myers,\r\n391 S.C. 308, 313, 705 S.E.2d 86, 89 (Ct. App. 2011) (\"In appeals from the family\r\ncourt, this court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the\r\npreponderance of the evidence.\"); S.C. Code Ann. § 20-3-630(A) (Supp. 2012)\r\n(defining \"marital property\" as \"all real and personal property which has been\r\nacquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of the date of\r\nfiling or commencement of marital litigation\"); Fitzwater v. Fitzwater, 396 S.C.\r\n361, 367, 721 S.E.2d 7, 10 (Ct. App. 2011) (providing nonmarital property \"can be\r\n. . . transmuted into marital property and become subject to equitable division if the\r\nproperty: (1) becomes so commingled with marital property as to be untraceable;\r\n(2) is utilized by the parties in support of the marriage; or (3) is titled jointly or\r\notherwise utilized in such a manner as to evidence an intent by the parties to make\r\nthe property marital property\"); Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 295, 372 S.E.2d\r\n107, 110 (Ct. App. 1988) (\"[T]ransmutation is a matter of intent to be gleaned from\r\nthe facts of each case.\"); id. at 295, 372 S.E.2d at 110-11 (\"The spouse claiming\r\ntransmutation must produce objective evidence showing that, during the marriage,\r\nthe parties themselves regarded the property as the common property of the\r\nmarriage.\"); Pittman v. Pittman, Op. No. 27352 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Jan. 15, 2014)\r\n(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 2 at 93) (holding the husband's land survey business was\r\ntransmuted, relying in part on the husband paying the wife a high salary and\r\ncontributing to the wife's retirement account with the expectation that it would\r\nbenefit both parties during their retirement).\r\n\r\n2. As to whether the family court erred by valuing the dental office building at\r\n$1,363,455 based upon the testimony of court-appointed appraiser Calhoun\r\nKennedy, we find no abuse of discretion because the family court's valuation of the\r\ndental office building was within the range of values testified to at trial. See\r\nSkipper v. Skipper, 290 S.C. 412, 414, 351 S.E.2d 153, 154 (1986) (holding absent\r\nan agreement between the parties to the contrary, the family court should divide\r\nproperty according to value); Pirri v. Pirri, 369 S.C. 258, 264, 631 S.E.2d 279, 283\r\n\n(Ct. App. 2006) (noting when valuing marital assets, the \"family court may accept\r\nthe valuation of one party over another, and the court's valuation of marital\r\nproperty will be affirmed if it is within the range of evidence presented\"); Fuller v.\r\nFuller, 370 S.C. 538, 546-47, 636 S.E.2d 636, 641 (Ct. App. 2006) (providing \"the\r\nfamily court has broad discretion in valuing marital property\"); Smith v. Smith, 294\r\nS.C. 194, 198, 363 S.E.2d 404, 407 (Ct. App. 1987) (\"The weight that the trial\r\ncourt affords the testimony of witnesses, including parties, is discretionary with the\r\ntrial court.\").\r\n\r\n3. As to whether the family court erred in equitably dividing marital property, we\r\nfind no abuse of discretion because the family court properly considered the\r\nrelevant statutory factors and the apportionment was both fair and equitable. See\r\nPruitt v. Pruitt, 389 S.C. 250, 269, 697 S.E.2d 702, 713 (Ct. App. 2010) (\"The\r\napportionment of marital property is within the discretion of the family court and\r\nwill not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\"); S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n20-3-620(B) (Supp. 2012) (providing fifteen factors the family court is to consider\r\nin apportioning the marital estate, but also affording the family court discretion to\r\ngive such weight to each factor as it finds appropriate); Doe v. Doe, 370 S.C. 206,\r\n213-14, 634 S.E.2d 51, 55 (Ct. App. 2006) (\"On appeal, this court looks to the\r\noverall fairness of the apportionment, and it is irrelevant that this court might have\r\nweighed specific factors differently than the family court.\"). Additionally, the\r\nfamily court did not err by making findings concerning Husband's character,\r\nconduct, and testimony at trial. The family court was entitled to make credibility\r\nfindings, and the findings are supported by the record. See Lewis v. Lewis, 392\r\nS.C. 381, 392, 709 S.E.2d 650, 655 (2011) (\"[W]hile retaining the authority to\r\nmake our own findings of fact, we recognize the superior position of the family\r\ncourt judge in making credibility determinations.\" (footnote omitted)); Gandy v.\r\nGandy, 297 S.C. 411, 414, 377 S.E.2d 312, 313-14 (1989) (\"Custody is based on a\r\ndetermination of the character, fitness, attitude and inclinations on the part of each\r\nparent.\"). Further, regarding whether the family court erred by requiring Husband\r\nto make post-divorce mortgage payments to Wife, we find this issue is\r\nunpreserved. Husband failed to raise any issues concerning the nature of the\r\ninterest-only loan or the disposition of the marital home mortgage payments to the\r\nfamily court during trial or in either of his Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motions. See Buist\r\nv. Buist, 399 S.C. 110, 124, 730 S.E.2d 879, 886 (Ct. App. 2012) (providing an\r\nissue raised for the first time on appeal is unpreserved).\r\n\r\n4. As to whether the family court erred by requiring Husband to secure the child\r\nsupport award with a $500,000 life insurance policy naming Wife as the\r\n\nbeneficiary, we reverse and remand. Neither the family court's order nor its two\r\norders responding to Husband's Rule 59(e) motions provide special circumstances\r\nas to why Husband is required to maintain a life insurance policy to secure child\r\nsupport payments. Accordingly, we reverse the family court's order requiring\r\nHusband to maintain a life insurance policy to secure the child support payments\r\nand remand to make factual findings of any special circumstances requiring\r\nsecurity for the child support award. See Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 553,\r\n615 S.E.2d 98, 109 (2005) (finding the family court may order the payor spouse to\r\nobtain life insurance as security for an alimony or child support obligation if the\r\nsupported spouse can demonstrate the existence of special circumstances with\r\nreference to the need for the security and the payor spouse's ability to provide it);\r\nid. (\"If a need for security is found, the family court should next consider the\r\npayor spouse's ability to secure the award with life insurance, i.e., the payor\r\nspouse's age, health, income earning ability, accumulated assets, insurability, cost\r\nof premiums, and insurance plans carried by the parties during the marriage.\"). If\r\nthe family court determines special circumstances exist to require a life insurance\r\npolicy to secure the child support award, the court should order Husband to\r\nmaintain a policy only in an amount proportionate to his child support obligation.\r\nAdditionally, if security for the child support award is warranted, the family court\r\nshould order Husband to name the children as the beneficiaries to the life insurance\r\npolicy.

We affirm.\r\n\r\n1. We hold the trial court properly submitted the case to jury because the State\r\npresented sufficient evidence of guilt under a theory of accomplice liability.\r\n\"When ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with\r\nthe existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.\" State v. Brannon, 379\r\nS.C. 487, 494, 666 S.E.2d 272, 275 (Ct. App. 2008), (aff'd in result, 388 S.C. 498,\r\n697 S.E.2d 593 (2010). \"If there is any direct evidence or substantial\r\ncircumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, we\r\nmust find the case was properly submitted to the jury.\" Id. \"When reviewing a\r\ndenial of a directed verdict, an appellate court views evidence and all reasonable\r\ninferences in the light most favorable to the State.\" Id.\r\n\r\n\"Under the 'hand of one is the hand of all' theory, one who joins with another to\r\naccomplish an illegal purpose is liable criminally for everything done by his\r\nconfederate incidental to the execution of the common design and purpose.\" State\r\nv. Condrey, 349 S.C. 184, 194, 562 S.E.2d 320, 324 (Ct. App. 2002). \"Under an\r\naccomplice liability theory, a person must personally commit the crime or be\r\npresent at the scene of the crime and intentionally, or through a common design,\r\naid, abet, or assist in the commission of that crime through some overt act.\" Id. at\r\n194, 562 S.E.2d at 325 (internal quotation marks omitted). \"In order to establish\r\nthe parties agreed to achieve an illegal purpose, thereby establishing presence by\r\npre-arrangement, the State need not prove a formal expressed agreement, but rather\r\ncan prove the same by circumstantial evidence and the conduct of the parties.\"\r\nState v. Gibson, 390 S.C. 347, 354, 701 S.E.2d 766, 770 (Ct. App. 2010).\r\nTestimony from the various witnesses gave rise to the inference that Callaham\r\nacted as a lookout and getaway driver.\r\n\r\n2. We hold the trial court properly submitted the case to the jury because the State\r\npresented sufficient independent evidence of the corpus delicti to corroborate\r\nCallaham's statement. \"[A] conviction cannot be based on extra-judicial\r\nconfessions of a defendant unless they are corroborated by proof aliunde of the\r\ncorpus delicti.\" State v. Osborne, 335 S.C. 172, 175, 516 S.E.2d 201, 202 (1999)\r\n(footnote omitted). \"[T]he corroboration rule is satisfied if the State provides\r\nsufficient independent evidence which serves to corroborate the defendant's extra-\r\njudicial statements and, together with such statements, permits a reasonable belief\r\nthat the crime occurred.\" Id. at 180, 516 S.E.2d at 205. Direct evidence is not\r\nnecessary to prove the corpus delicti. Id. Rather, proof of the corpus delicti can be\r\n\nestablished by circumstantial evidence, when it is the best evidence obtainable. Id.\r\nIf any evidence establishes the corpus delicti, the trial court must submit that\r\nquestion to the jury. Id. Testimony from witnesses gave rise to the inference that\r\nCallaham acted as a lookout and getaway driver while armed men forced their way\r\ninto a couple's home with the intent to rob them, threated to kill the couple's one-\r\nand-half year old son, and attempted to escape with money and a gold chain.\r\nAccordingly, the State submitted evidence, independent of Callaham's statement,\r\nto show a crime had been committed.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.1\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and PIEPER and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1   We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-036","title":"State v.
